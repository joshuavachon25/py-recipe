PREFACE 



In this \oJume, dealing with food in health and disease, the theory 
and principles of dietetics are applied to the many conditions and 
circumstances of life, and, with my previous work on " Foods: their 
Origin, Composition, and Manufacture," it forms a complete system 
of dietetics. 

Dietetics and the application of its principles has been my special 
study for many years, and the more I learn of the subject, the greater 
importance it assumes in my estimation. In fact, I deem it of "such 
importance to mankind that I would there were appointed a Pro- 
fessor of Dietetics in e\ery Universit}' and Medical College through- 
out the world, and tliat this subject should be given the same 
prominence in the curriculum of the medical student which is given 
to materia rnedica and therapeutics. In all colleges of agriculture 
prominence is given to the study of animal and plant foods. If 
such knowledge is deemed of importance to the breeder of animals 
and the grower of grain or fruit, surely it is no less so to the phy- 
sician who has the care of the human body. Indeed, I have no 
hesitation in saying that tlie study of dietetics and its practical 
application would benefit 50 per cent, of the physicians' clients 
when they are sick, and is no less important as a branch of preventa- 
tive medicine. 

Life consists of a series of changes in the protoplasm — the birth, 
growth, and death of cells following each other in an interminable 
cycle. But the processes of life can only go on in a normal manner 
when the cells are supplied with a well-balanced food, suitable for 
their needs. This demands a supply of protein, fat, and carbo- 
hydrate in due proportions. A study of the composition of foods 
shows the absurdity of fads; it also shows that all the elements 
can be derived equally well from the animal or vegetable kingdoms, 
so that the poorest individual may be well fed if the principles of 
dietetics are properly applied. 

But no suoner has the isodjnamical law of foods received general 



vi PREFACE 

acceptance, than doubt is thrown on its uni\crsal application. The 
question whcihej all proteins aie of the same value to the body has 
recently been debated and investigated. To enable each cell in 
the body to maintain its edifice according to its architectural plan, 
it must be supplied with building-stones of a proper pattern. These 
building-stones are amino-acids. All proteins contain them, but 
the kinds and proportions are not always the same. It has been 
shown by biological experiments that life and growth cannot be 
maintamed when certain amino-acids are deficient. 

It "has long been known that life cannot be supported on a diet 
which is deficient in inorganic salts. But less is known of the role 
of the salts in the body than of the primary elements of the food. 
" The balance of acid and basic group, the changing need for indi- 
vidual elements like phosphorus, calcium, ciilorine, and iron, 
furnish a series of complex variables which are probably as indis- 
pensable to certain aspects of nutrition as they are unappreciated." 

But it has been found that something more is essential for the 
mamtenance of growth and well-being than protein, fat, carbo- 
hjdrates, and salts; that foods contain a minute proportion of 
accessor)' bodies, and when these are deficient or absent from the 
diet, the immature body does not grow, the mature body does not 
maintain its condition, and there are manifestations of more or less 
serious disease. A considerable amount of research into the nature 
of the group of accessory bodies, which have been called " vita- 
mines," has been made. It has long been known that certain foods 
have a greater growth-producing power than others; that fresh 
milk prevents scurvy and rickets, and boiled or condensed milk 
cause these diseases; that oatmeal causes more rapid and greater 
growth than bread, and wholemeal bread than white bread; that 
beri-beri, pellagra, and other diseases are associated with the con- 
sumption of certain foods. The reasons have not been clear, but 
considerable light has teen thro^^'n on these matters by the recent 
investigation of the vitamines. So important are the vitamines 
that they are now regarded as a sine qua non of proper nutrition, 
and the subject is so far-reaching that it involves a large proportion 
of the foods of civilized man. 

The phosphorus-deficiency theory of the cause of certain groups 
of disease^ brings into prominence the importance of the lipoidal 
constituents of the diet and the role these substances play in the 
life and metabolism of the cells, which, again, is not separated 
from the role of the salts.

PREFACE 



The study by many men uf tlie enzymes and their striking specifi- 
city, of tlie lipoids by Overton and Meyer, of tlie salts by Lillie and 
l.oeb, of the insufficiency of certain proteins by Osborne and Mendel, 
of the \ itaraines by Casimir Funk and others during the last few 
years is epoch-making, and has caused a corresponding advance in 
dietetics. These discoveries are so important as to raise the ques- 
tion whether nutritive failure or success does not depend as much on 
the accessor}- bodies — the vitamines, enzymes, and lipoids — as on 
the primary elements of the diet. • An attempt is made in this 
volume to give an account of the most recent researches in these 
subjects, and to place the results in a proper light. 

It is hoped that this book, while satisfying the need of the prac- 
ticaJ physician, may stimulate further research, and that the phy- 
sician himself may be induced to make observations on the effects 
of various kinds of foods in those whose metabolism is disturbed by 
disease, as well as in those whose physiological and metabolical 

processes are normal.

FOOD IN HEALTH AND DISEASE 
PART I 

INTRODUCTION 

The 3tock from which primitive man was evolved fed on fruit, 
nuts, roots, eggs, birds, and insects. The Asiatic stock became 
shepherds, domesticated several species of animals, and the more 
settled tribes began the cultivation of cereals in the alluvial plains 
of great rivers. The arts of domestication and cultivation were 
g^radually diffused over a wide region of the earth. According to 
Qesar, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and other ancient writers, the 
British aborigines did not cultivate the ground, but lived on fish, 
flesh, milk, and the herbs of the field. The Danish kitchen middens 
show that their Continental neighbours also were consumers of 
flesh and fish. The common ox was domesticated from ancestors 
which cannot now be traced; but the present species in Europe 
are descended from cattle diffused by the Romans, and were prob- 
ably derived from Egyptian or Indian cattle. Domestic sheep 
were probably derived from wild animals in Africa, Greece, and 
Central Asia, the pig from ancestors which inhabited the forests 
of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The date of cultivation of the cereals 
cannot be discovered with certainty. Wheat was cultivated in 
Egypt before the Shepherd Kings; it was found enclosed in a brick 
of the Pyramids, to which the date 3359 B.C. has been given. But 
it was probabl}' first cultivated at an earlier date in the valley of 
the Euphrates. The Chinese date the art of bread-making from 
about 2000 B.C., but bread was in use among the Chaldeans and 
Eg^'ptians before that date. The cultivation of rice in China dates 
from 2800 B.C., and in British India at least from the Aryan invasion. 
The Greeks became acquainted with it through Alexander's expedi- 
tion (334 B.C.). The Arabs introduced it into Spain, and the 
Spaniards into America. Rye is not so ancient: it has not been 
found in Eg}'ptian monuments; the Greeks did not know it, nor 
did the lake-dweUers of Switzerland in the Bronze Age ; it probably- 
had its origin along the banks of the Danube. Oats have been 
cultivated for 2,000 yea.rs in Europe. They were knoMii to the 
Greeks, but the Egyptians did not cultivate them. Barley was 



a ISTRODUCriON 

cultivated in Switzerland and Italy before the lake-dwellers pos- 
sessed metals, and some varieties have been found in Greece and 
r.i:\pt. Indian corn was cultivated in America before it was 
T! I'vered bv Columbiis. and undoubtedly it was a product of the 
ancient inhabitants of Peru and Mexico. Millet was cultivated in 
Asia and Africa in prehistoric times. There is evidence of its culti- 
\.Tti.jn in China in 2800 B.C. and that it .=.pread westward through 
Ki:^>ia and Austria until it reached Switzerland and Italy in the 
Stone Age. Some fonn> of millet were cultivated in Eg>^pt at an 
cquallv early period, and became known to the ancient Greeks and 
Romans. Indian millet, or durra, has been cultivated in Egypt 
for 4,000 years, and is believed to have had its origin in Africa, 
and spread thence to India and China. 

The p<itato originated in Chih, and its cultivation in North 
.\mcrica and Europe began after the discovery of America by 
Columbus.- The parden pea was brought into Greece and Italy by 
the Arvans from Western .A-ia. Beans were also first cultivated by 
the Aryans, and introduced b}' thern into Europe; but the haricot, 
frijole, and Lima beans originated in South America. The cultiva- 
tion of lentils in Eg^-pt and Chaldea was begun before all histon^', 
but the}' grew wild in Greece and Italy before the}' were cultivated 
there. Manv of our vegetables grew wild in Europe long before 
they were cultivated. The caulitiower was known to the Greeks 
and Romans. The cabbage was cultivated before" the Aryan 
invasion. Spinach was cultivated by the Medes and Persians; it was 
common at Nineveh and Bab\ion. The cultivation of onions appears 
to have originated in India, but they were known to the ancient 
Eg> ptians, and probably came from India through Eg\-pt to Greece, 

The cultivation of fruit is probably not so ancient as that of the 
cereals.^ Grapes grew wild in Southern Europe, but their cultiva- 
tion was introduced by the Phoenicians. Records of wine-making 
go back 5,000 to 6,000 years. Apples and pears grew wild in 
Britain, but their cultivation was introduced by the Romans. The 
SMcet orange came from China, where ito cultivation is prehistoric; 
the citron from Western Asia, where it was cultivated by the 
Medes. The lemon was brought into Europe from the gardens of 
Eg>'pt and Palestine. Pineapples first came from South America; 
bananas from Southern Asia, where they were found at the time of 
Alexander's expedition; but it is probable that they were first 
cultivated in the Malay Archipelago. 

The irruption of the Aryans into Europe was the means of intro- 
ducing the ajltivation of cereals and increasing the domestication 
of animals,' and in consequence the European diet became mixed. 
Uie overgrowth of population in Eastern Asia caused the con- 
sumption of rice, through the lack of animal food. To this day the 
Arab lives on his original diet of fruit, nuts, eggs, birds, etc.; and 
the Evjuimau remains an example of the flesh-eater. Great has 
been tlie influence of man upon his diet. Very few of our foods are 
now used in their natural condition. The art of gastronomy, or 



FOOD rONSTfTriFNTS 3 

science of good living, affected by the epicure, has had an appreciable 
effect upon the development and refinement of materials for the 
table. The art of cookery, fostered by the desires of people, has 
developed the methods of preparing foods in such a way as to be 
agreeable to the palate, pleasant to the eye, and attractive by their 
general utility. This volume has nothing to do with g astrono my 
or ^ cooke ry : it is confined to d ietetics . DietetksjsJihe^sc^encelDr 
feeding. It has to deal with the necessitiesof the body and the 
aGility of food to supply those necessities in tlie various circum- 
stances and conditions of life. It is based upon a very broad 
foundation of chemistry and physiology. It is an inductive science, 
and therefore the base must be firm and well established. Experi- 
ence is a good guide in many sciences, as well as in every department 
of human life. But experience alone is not sufficient to establish 
the necessity or desirability for any special course of action. This 
has been well exemplified in dietetics. The endeavour to under- 
stand dietetics without the assistance of chemistry and physiology 
would be futile. 

Food Values. — Food is required for growth and repair — that is, 
to build up the organism and make good the losses sustained by 
physiological processes; to maintain the heat of the organism and 
supply it with mechanical energy. Foods contain a varying pro- 
portion of chemical constituents belonging to the groups of proteins, 
fats, carbohydrates, mineral salts, and water. The body is com- 
posed of materials belonging to the same groups. 

The proteins include — 

1. Protamins. 

2. Histons. 

3. Albumins — egg-albumin, serum-albumin, milk-albumin, muscle-albumin, 
and cell-albumin. 

4. Globulins — senim-globulin, myo-globulin, myosinogen, fibrinogen. 

5. Glutelins — legumin, conglutin, etc. 

6. Gliadins — -wheat-gliadin, hordein, zcin, etc. 

7. Scleroproteins — gelatin, chondrin, collagen, keratin, elastin, chitin. 

8. Phosphoproteins — ovo-vitellin, casinogen. 

9. Conjugated Proteins: 

{a) Nticleo-proteins — e.g., nucleo-histon, leuco-nuclein, cyto-globin. 
(6) Gluco-proteins — e.g., mucin, euglobin. 
(c) Chromo-proteins — e.g., haemoglobin. 

1 o. Derivatives of Protein : 

(a) Metaproteins — acid-albumin, alkali-albumin, etc. 

{b) Proteoses — albumose, globulose, gelatose, caseinose, etc. 

(c) Peptones — albumin-peptone, gelatin-peptone. 

\d) Polypeptides — glycyl-glycin, alanyl-alanin. 

In addition to proteins there are the nitrogenous extractives — 

(a) Nuclein bases or pnrin bodies — hypoxanthin, xanthin, uric acid, 
adenin, giianin, carnin, keteroxanthin, theophyllin, theobromin, and caflfein. 

(b) Guanadin bases — creatin and creatinin. 

(c) Amides and amino-acids — leucin, asparagin, glutaminic acid, etc.

4 INTRODUCTrON 

Proteins form the principal jxirt <»f muscles, bones, and many 
otlier tissiies of animal bodies; they also constitute souk^ of the 
most important vegetable structures. As a source of nutriment to 
mankintl they arc exceedini^ly important. They are most abundant 
in animal foods, such as lean meat, fish, fowl, milk, cheese, and eggs; 
but all legumes and nuts contain a considerable proportion of 
proteins, and they are present in grain. Proteins are of value to 
the human body as tissue-formers, and secondly as producers of 
energy, being equal in the latter respect to carbohydrates. The 
extractives are not tissue-formers as a rule. The purin and guanadin 
bases yield little energy, but they have a food value as flavouring 
agents, render our food appetizing, and to some extent are stimu- 
lants. The palatability of meat and soup is due to their presence. 
The exact food value of the amides is not known; they are used 
in the constructive processes of plants, being directly converted 
into globulins ami other proteins. In the animal economy they 
do not appear to be directly used in tissue formation, and are 
considered to have an inferior food value. But asparagin is a 
stimulant to cell activity, and it activates various enzymes, whence 
it may be deduced that the presence of amides in our food is not 
valueless, and should not be disregarded. The amino-acids may 
be directly utilized in protein formation, and they have a decided 
heat value. 

The fats consist of neutral fats of the fatty acids: stearin, olein, 
and palmitin. Many fatty substances contain small proportions 
of free acids: stearic, oleic, palmitic, capric, caprylic, caproic, and 
butyric acids. These substances are widely distributed through 
the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Fat is essential in the food 
of mankind; it is absorbed ready-formed from the food, or manu- 
factured in the body from proteins and carbohydrates. Neutral 
fats and fatty acids are valuable foods, but serve chiefly as a source 
of heat and mechanical energy. Besides these, there are various 
nitrogenous fats, called lipoids, including lecithins and cholesterins. 
Lecithins are widely distributed; they are constituents of every 
animal and vegetable cell, but are especially abundant in brains, 
yolk of eggs, fish-roe, blood, bile, yeast, maize, peas, beans, wheat, 
and beetroot. Cholesterin is also constantly present in animal 
and vegetable cells; it is abundant in bile, blood, yolk of eggs, 
spleen, nerve tissues, wool-fat; it is also present in wheat, barley, 
peas, beans, lentils, carrots, beetroot, almonds, peanuts, etc. 
The exact role played by these substances in the vital functions is 
not settled. But they are indispensable to man, and a constant 
supply is essential to the organism. 

The carbohydrates are chiefly as follows: 

1. Monosaccharides: 

Pentoses — arabinose, xylose, ribose, and rhamnose. 

Hexoses — dextrose, levulose, galactose, mannose, .sorbinose, etc. 

2. Disaccharides — saccharose, maltose, lactose. 

3. Trisaccharides — raffinose or melitose, stachyose. 



FOOD CONSTITUENTS 5 

4. Polysaccharides : 

Amyloses — starcli, inulin, glycogen. 
Mucilages — dextrin, gums. 
Celluloses — true cellulose, hemicellulose. 
Pectose bodies. 

Carbohydrates are chiefly of value to the animal organism for 
the production of hea^ and imiscular_ energy. When tiie metab- 
ohsm is perfect, any cafFohydrate consumed i n ex cess of the 
ordinary requirement is converted into glycogen and faT^ and stored 
for providing heat^ ancT energy at a future date. Carbohydrates 
iirc^essential to the well-being of the organism; reduction of the 
intake below the essential point frequently leads to acetonuria. 
Most carbohydrates are of vegetable origin, but a few of them arise 
in^thc^animai kingdom — e.g., glycogen! , lactose, galactose, inosite, 
glucosamine, and some glucosides. \'arious proteins contain carbo- 
hyclrate in their molecular structure, especially gluco-proteins; and 
^many chemists hold the opinion that most proteins have a carbo- 
iiydrate nucleus^in their complex composition. 

The aiineral substances form 5 or 6 per cent, b^^ wei^jht of the 
human, body, and are constantly leaving it by various channels. 
They yield very little heat or energy, but they serve good purposes 
in the bod}', and are indispensable elements of the food. They give 
solklijy and stability to the organism by_ constituting a considerable 
proportion of the bones. They keep various proteins in solution, 
and confer upon them the property of electrical conductivity. 
They are necessary for all the secretions, and assist in the general 
metabolism. The carbonates of soda, potash, iron, and other 
minerals, render ovir blood and secretions alkaline. The removal of 
carbon dioxide~Ts"^performed chiefly by the alkaline carbonates, 
which take it from the blood and surrender it to the air in the lungs. 
The phosphates of lime, magnesia, soda, and potash, enter into the 
composition oT bone, other tissues, and secretions; and organic com- 
pounds of phosphorus enter into the composition of brain, nerves, 
muscIesTBlood, and the nuclei of cells. Sulphur and its compounds 
enter into the composition of many tissues m the body and some of 
the secretions. Sylphates of soda, potash, lime, magnesia, and 
manganese, occur in many foods. Chlorine is required for all human 
structures and secretions. The need for chloride of sodium is great ; 
it enters the system with many foods, "is readily absorbed, and 
easily leaves it. Its presence promotes metabolism. The total 
d^ily requirement of salts is estimated at about 360^ grains. They^ 
consist of calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, mangan(5se, and 
iron, in combination with carbonic, sulphuric, phosphoric, and 
silicic acids, chlorine and fluorine. Many organic acids are taken 
in with our food: they are chiefly acetic, citric, malic, oxalic, and 
tartaric acids; and citrates, acetates, oxalates, malates, and tar- 
trates. These are mostly transformed into alkaline carbonates in 
their course through the system, and usefully increase the alkalinity 
of the blood and secretions. 



6 IS'TliOnUCTION 

T^Jater is quite as iniporlaiu lor the animal bod}' as other foods. 
Without it the elements could not be combined into an organism, 
nor could the organism carry out its physiological functions. It 
forms 5S;5percent . by we ight of the human btjd}'. The daily re- 
ciuirementTsestnnated from the average loss by the skin, lun^s, and 
kidney's, which e xcrete a total of a bout 8 ounces a day. This loss 
has to be made good by food and drinTc"! 

It has become an established custom to compare the human 
body to a machine. A machine derives its power from fuel; the 
body does the same. In both instances the potential energy of the 
fuel is transfonued into the kinetic energy or mechanical power 
which works the machine. In both cases the energy which is 
not used in work escapes in the form of heat. The human body 
uses the mechanical power chiefly in muscular work; the heat is 
used in warming the body and causing the evaporation of moisture 
from its surface. There are, of course, material differences between 
the human body and a mechanical engine. The engine has to be 
made, repaired, fed, and regulated. The human machine grows, 
it repairs itself, feeds and regulates itself. The material and 
energy of the human machine is derived from the food; and as its 
tissues are made out of the food, so can those tissues be used for 
fuel. The engine can neither repair itself nor consume its own 
substance. The animal organism is much superior to the mechanical 
engine. It is more economical in the use of fuel; it has a nervous 
organization rendering it sensible to impressions and capable of 
directing its energies. The human machine is capable of adapting 
itself to many circumstances and changes in the demands made 
upon it. But t o enab le the body to continue to.pcr.fprm these func- 
tions indefinitel^Mt rriust'be properly fed; and tlic_propcf' feeding of 
t he bo dy requires a knowledge of lTs composition and the exchanges 
whjch_are^constah{ Ty gomg on. This knowledge is to be derived 
from the sfudy oT metaboTTsm, the analysis of fo ods, and a deter- 
mination of their Keat value. ~ Protems, fats, and carbohydrates, 
all yield heat and energy; but proteins alone are capable of being 
transformed into muscle and other living cells, whence they are 
called " flesh-fojTners." The albumins, globulins, and their deriva- 
tives, are alone capable of being built up into the cells of muscles, 
tendon, cartilage, bone, skin, and blood. The scleroproteins or 
gelatinoids, dissolved out of gristle, tendon, and bone, by boiling, 
are similar to albumins and globulins, and it is believed they are 
not flesh-formers. But they are admirable protein-sparers; that 
is to say, when the food contains an abundance of gelatinoid sub- 
stances in a digestible fomi.a smaller quantity of proteins is required 
by the body. This explains fully the value of soup made from 
bones, gristle, and other nitrogenous materials of a like character, 
as well as gelatin and its preparations. Fats and carboh^^clra.tes 
are not tissue-formers; their primary function is to supply the 
body witW fuel_or[heat and energy. Although the various groups 



FOOD VALUES 7 

of foods are not equally useful to the body, they all serve as a source 
of heat and energy. 

The value of any food as a source of heat and energy can be 
determined in several ways. The most important method is by 
ascertaining the amount of heat developed during the combustion 
of a known quantity of the food in question. This can be done 
by using a bomb-calorimeter. The heat given off during the com- 
bustion is a measure of the latent or potential energy of the food. 
The kinetic energy of the food is the amount of heat developed 
by the proportion which is digested. This matter will be dealt with 
more fully in the text. The unit commonly used is th e calo rie, or 
amount of heat-vvjii ch w ould be required to raise the temperature 
of I kilogramme of water i° C. The calorie is about equal to the 
amount of heat required to raise the temperature offi^und of 
\vater 4° F) The older observers, instead of the calorie, used the 
foot-ton asa unit, and this represented the force required to raise 
I ton weight through i foot of height. A calorie is equal to 1-54 foot- 
tons; in other words, a calorie of heat, when transformed to mechan- 
ical energy, would raise i ton 1-54 feet. ^ 

Food values may also be calculated from well-known factorsT 
Thus, it has been determined that i gramme of protein or carbo- 
hydrate yields in the body 4-1 calories; i gramme of fat, 9-3 calories;! 
and I gramme of alcohol, 7 calories.- Therefore, w^hen 100 grammesj 
of milk contain 3-5 grammes of protein, 4 grammes of fat, and) 
5 grammes of carbohydrate, the heat value of the milk is (3-5 -f5-o)^ 
X 4-1 + (4-0 X 9-3) = 72 calories. This method shows that i pound 
of milk might be expected to yield 320 calories; the amount it 
actually yields in a bomb-calorimeter during combustion is 
325 calories, which proves that calculation of the calorie value by 
factors is sufficiently reliable for clinical purposes. ^ 

The food value may also be calculated by using the formula — 
Protein : Fat : Carbohydrate ; : 5 : 3 : i; but this is only rehable 
when the digestibility of the constituents of the food is known. It 
may be accepted that in animal foods 97 per cent, of the protein, 
95 per cent, of fat, and 98 per cent, of carbohydrate, is digestible; 
in vegetable foods, generally 84 per cent, of the protein, 90 per cent, 
of fats, and 95 per cent, of carbohydrates, is digestible; in cereal 
foods 85 per cent, of proteins, but in leguminous foods only 78 per 
cent, of proteins, is digestible. \\'ater may be reckoned as having 
a food value of i per 1,000, and this figure may be added to the 
nutrients in barley-water and similar infusions. With these figures 
before us, when the percentage composition of any food is known, 
we can calculate the calorie value and food value of any 
substance. The following examples of food values may be useful: 

Roast beef : 1,000 grammes contain — 

Protein . . 222 grammes gross, equal to 215 grammes digestible. 
Fat .. 285 „ „ 275 

.*. Food value is (2 1 5 x s) H- (270 x 3) = i ,868. 



8 INTRODUCTION 

Bread : i.ckio grammes contain — 

Protein . . 77 grammes gross, equal to 64-68 grammes digestible. 

Fat .. ..9 .. .. 8-IO 

Carbohydrate 469 ,. ,, 445'S5 

.-. Food v-alue is (64*68 x 5)+ (8-iox 3)+ (445*55 x i) =793- 

Butter : i ,000 grammes contain — 

Protein . . . . 10 grammes gross, equal to 9*7 grammes digestible. 

Fat .. .. 810 ,, ,, 769'0 

Carbohydrate ..15 ,, ,, 14*7 ,, „ 

.'. Food value is (9*7 x 5)+(769X 3)+ 14*7 x i) =2,371, 

Potatoes : 1,000 grammes contain — 

I'rotein . . . .2o'o grammes gross, equal to i6'8 grammes digestible. 

Fat .. .. 1-6 ,, „ 1*4 

Carbohydrate I95'0 ,, ,, i8S'2 ,, ,, 

.•. Food value is (i6'8 x 5)+ (f4X 3)+ (i8S'2x i) =273. 

Dried peas : i ,000 grammes contain — 

Protein. . . . 238 grammes gross, equal to i85'o grammes digestible. 

Fat .. ..18 ,, ,, i6-2 

Carbohydrate . . 600 ,, ,, S70'o ,, ,, 

.•. Food value is (185X 5)+ (i6*2x 3)+ (S70X i) = 1,544. 

Boiled cabbage : i ,000 grammes contain — 

Protein . . . . 6 grammes gross, equal to 5*00 grammes digestible. 

Fat .... I ,, ,, '95 

Carbohydrate ..14 ,, ,. I3*30 

.-. Food value is (5X 5)+(*9Sx 3)+(i3*3X 0=41. 

Raw apples : 1,000 grammes contain — 

Protein . . . . 4 grammes gross, equal to 3'36 grammes digestible. 

Fat .. ••5 .. .. 4*5<' 

Carbohydrate .. 126 ,, ,, ii8'7(> ,, ,, 

.-. Food value is (3*36 x 5)+(4-5X 3)+(ii8-7X i)=i49- 

Calculation of the Constituents in One Ounce of Food : Let the 

number of grammes per cent, be divided by 3'52, the dividend 
will represent the grammes per ounce — e.g., one ounce of cooked 
beef contains 285 divided by 3-52= 8- 1 grammes of protein, and 
41-25 divided by 3-52= ii-6 grammes of fat.

CHAPTER I 

THE DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION OF FOOD 

The elements which constitute tlie material of our body are de- 
rived from food. But our food undergoes various changes in its 
character and constitution before it is transformed into flesh and 
blood, and it is not directly converted into flesh and blood; it is 
assimilated by the tissues already existing. Assimilation is the 
function possessed by living cells of taking up extraneous substances 
and making them a part and parcel of their own material. The 
dead food has not life conferred on it immediately, but it becomes 
living by assimilation to living substance. Assimilation is necessary 
for the growth and reproduction of individual cells; assimilation pro- 
vides for the development and growth of the whole community of 
cells or animal body; and the same process makes good the losses of 
the community caused by the incessant activity of the functional 
divisions or organs, the wear and tear of the communal machinery 
by muscular work and exercise, and the production of heat and 
energy. 

The changes which food undergoes in the alimentary canal are 
physical and chemical. While being finely divided and reduced to 
a pulp in the mouth, the food is mixed with saliva and brought 
under the influence of its enzjmies. The action of ptyalin is shown 
by the following equation : 

io(C6Hio05)k4-4(H20)« = 4(Ci2H220ii)«+ (CeHioOs)^^- (CfiHioOg)^. 

Starch Water Maltose Achroo-dextrin Erythro-dextrin 

Starch is first converted to amiduhn, or soluble starch, then into 
erythro-dextrin, and the latter into various types of achroo-dextrin, 
and finally into sugar. Most of the sugar arising from salivary 
digestion is maltose; but the secretion contains another enzyme 
cdiWed glucasc , which transforms some of the maltose into dextrose. 
The secretion of saliva is an important aid to deglutition; it is 
stimulated by careful mastication and provocatives. Such as pepper, 
mustard, or horseradish. But the food stays in the mouth such a 
short time that the action of saliva is not completed therein; the 
secretion is swallowed with the food, and its enzyme continues to 
act on the starch until it is checked by the presence of gastric 
juice. 

The gastric juice contains several enzymes — namely, pepsin, the 



22 THE DIGESTION A ND ABSORPTION OF FOOD 

proteolytic enzyme; rennin, the milk-curdling ferment; and lipase, 
the fat-splitting ferment. The uses of the gastric juice are — 
{a) digestive, {h) activating, and (c) disinfecting. The secretion of 
this fluid continues for a period which varies with the nature of 
the gastric contents. There are two chief phases or periods of 
gastric secretion: {a) The psychic or appetite juice; and {h) the 
chemical juice. 

[a] The PsvcJiic or Appetite Juice. — This is called forth by the 
desire, thought, taste, smell, and enjoyment, of food, especially 
in genial company and pleasant surroundings; but it is inhibited 
by pain, discomfort, worry, mental distress, and fatigue of mind 
or body. 

{b) The Chemical Juice. — In the second phase or period of gastric 
digestion, the exciting agent is the presence of food in the stomach. 
It was sliown by Bayliss and Starling that a correlation of the 
functions of the different organs of the body is brought about by 
hormones, or chemical messengers. The hormone of gastric diges- 
tion is produced from proteins in the early stage of digestion, and 
this shows the importance of the psychic or appetite juice. A 
similar effect is produced in men and animals by meat extracts and 
infusions, which are well-known provocatives of gastric secretion. 

The changes which food undergoes in the stomach are as follows: 
The food is disintegrated; meat is broken up, gelatin dissolved; the 
muscular fibres fall apart, and are split into discs and sarcous 
elements; the framework of fatty tissues undergoes similar dissolu- 
tion, and fat is set free by dissolution of cellular membranes. Milk 
is curdled; the caseinogen is transformed to casein, and the latter 
broken down by pepsin. Bread and other starchy foods are dis- 
integrated, some of the starch being transformed to sugar by 
ptyalin. The other vegetable foods are but little digested in this 
viscus. The whole is broken into irregular fragments by the dis- 
integrating power of the stomach, and gradually converted into 
chyme — the creamy emulsion which passes through the pylorus into 
the intestines. The passage from the stomach into the duodemmi 
is aided by the motor activity of this organ. 

The passage of food through the alimentary canal has been studied 
by the X rays. For this observation the food is mixed with bis- 
muth, which throws a shadow on the screen. Deglutition is reflex. 
When this action is not in process, the walls of the oesophagus are 
in contact. A mouthful of fluid takes five to eight seconds to pass 
from the phar\'nx into the stomach, about half the time being occu- 
pied in going through the cardiac sphincter. But the passage of 
solid food occupies a longer time, unless it is immediately Tollowed 
b}' a mouthful of fluid. The stomach is divided into the cardiac 
portion, or fundus, the pyloric antrum, and the pylorus. During 
digestion the fundus is divided from the pyloric antrum by the 
transverse band of Home. This division is rarely observed in the 
cadaver, except in frozen specimens of the digesting stomach; but 
it is seen by means of the X rays. The fundus is the storehouse; 



GASTRIC DIGESTION 23 

in it the bulk of the food forms a mass round whicli the muscular 
walls contract. The reaction in the centre of this mass remains 
alkaline for at least two hours, during which period salivary digestion 
is going on ; while the outer portions are gradually permeated by 
the acid gastric juice, and the softened parts are squeezed off and 
driven into the pyloric antrum. The pyloric portion is the most 
active part of the stomach; here the reaction is entirely acid, and 
waves of peristaltic movement are visible. These have been de- 
scribed by Holzknecht, Hertz, and Cannon. They occur at regular 
intervals of fifteen to twenty seconds, and serve a double purpose. 
When the pylorus relaxes, food which is fine enough to pass is 
driven through by peristalsis; if the food is not fine enough, the 
pyloric sphincter spasmodically closes, and it is returned by a 
central reflux ; and thus the food is circulated, thoroughly churned, 
and mixed with the gastric juice. The pylorus is stimulated to 
relax by the presence of acid liquid food, which is squirted period- 
icall}^ through the opening by the wave of contraction; and an 
alkaline reaction in the duodenum favours the relaxation. The 
pylorus is stimulated to contract by the projection of undigested 
food against it, and by the presence of acid food in the duodenum. 
The effect of acid and alkaline fluids on the pylorus was experi- 
mentally proved by Pawlow. The injection of a solution of o-io per 
cent, of hydrochloric acid through a fistula into the duodenum 
caused the pylorus to contract, but the injection of alkaline solutions 
and plain water had no such effect. 

The nature of the food influences the rate of its passage through 
the pylorus. Cannon showed by means of the X rays that when 
the meal consisted of lean meat, suet, and rice, properly cooked and 
prepared in such a manner that the constituents were thoroughly 
mixed together, the carbohydrates (rice) began to leave the stomach 
in fifteen minutes, but the protein (lean meat) and fat did not begin 
to leave under half an hour, and were much longer in passing 
through. He found that in a normal stomach a meal of rice or 
potatoes got out of the stomach rapidly, no trace being left in three 
hours; a meal of protein and fat (fat meat) was much slower, some 
being present six hours after the meal. Indigestible substances are 
rejected by the sphincter and returned to the digesting cavity over 
and over again ; but in process of time the sphincter relaxes, and the 
peristaltic contractions increase until the force is sufficient to drive 
through the opening hard substances like peas, plum-stones, and 
coins. Beer leaves the stomach more slowly than water, and salt 
solutions are retained until they become isotonic with the gastric 
juice. Thus the stomach protects the intestines from the injurious 
effects of many substances by retaining them until their condition 
is changed. 

The action of gastric juice on foods is as follows: Most proteins 
yield proteoses and peptones, but certain substances called " para- 
peptone " and " anti-albuminate " occur; while the nucleo-proteins 
and phospho-proteins leave an insoluble residue called " dyspep- 



24 THE DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION OF FOOD 

tone." The proteoses are proto-protcose and hetero-proteose. 
Proto-proteose from fibrin fields considerable t3Tosin and indol, 
little leucin, and no gljxocoll; it contains 25 per cent, of basic 
nitrogen. Hetero-proteose from muscle-s\Titonin yields very little 
tNTOsin and indol, but an abundance of leucin and glycocoll, is richer 
in arginin, but poorer in histidin, than proto-proteose, and contains 
39 per cent, of basic nitrogen. The peptones are also mixtures of 
the same and other amino-acids. According to Siegfried and 
Kriiger, pepsin-fibrin peptone = C2iH34Ng09, and pepsin-gluten 
jieptone^CogHggN^Oio. They belong to the amphi-peptones of 
Kiihne's series, and are converted by trypsin into anti-peptones or 
pohpeptides. 

The action of pepsin on other bodies varies according to their 
nature. Collagen is converted first into gelatin, and then into 
gelatin-proteose and gelatin-peptone, which yield amino-acids. 
Mucin, the cement substance of cells, yields substances similar to 
peptones. Elastin is dissolved very slowly and yields very little 
peptone, but proteoses are produced which yield amino-acids on 
trj-ptic digestion. Keratin is insoluble. The action on animal cell- 
membranes varies: the nearer they are to elastin, the greater is 
the proportion dissolved; the nearer they are to keratin, the less 
is dissolved. Plant cell-mcmbranes {cellulose) are not acted on by 
gastric juice. Starch and sugar are not acted on. The connective 
tissue and cell-membranes of fatt}^ tissues are digested by pepsin ; 
fats — e.g., suet, oil, and butter — are not acted on ; but emulsified fats, 
like egg-3'olk, milk, and cream, are acted on b}^ lipase. Milk is 
coagulated by rennin, and the casein peptonized by gastric juice. 

Digestion in the intestines is due to the combined action of the 
bile, pancreatic juice, and succus entericus. It is unnecessary to 
give an account of these secretions, and the reader is referred to 
works of physiology. The material which enters the duodenum 
from the stomach is known as " chyme." It consists of — {a) The 
products of digestion up to the pylorus — viz., maltose, dextrose, 
levulose, proteose, peptone, and gelatin-peptone; {b) partly digested 
matters, such as starch, disintegrated meat, some forms of albumin, 
connective and elastic tissues, etc.; and (c) substances unchanged 
by saliva or gastric juice — fat, cellulose, and other vegetable matters. 
The acid ch}Tne provokes a flow of bile and pancreatic juice. It 
acts upon the prosecretin in the duodenal mucous membrane in such 
a manner that secretin, a hormone, is formed and carried by the blood 
to the cells of the pancreas, which it stimulates. The pancreatic 
secretion attains its maximum pressure about three hours after a 
meal; but, according to Pawlow, this varies according to the food, 
the maximum pressure being from three to four hours after milk, 
two hours after bread, and sooner than that after meat. The 
enzymes of the pancreatic fluid are trypsin, amylopsin, lipase, and 
pancreatic rennin. Amylase or amylopsin is a diastatic ferment 
which acts on carbohydrates, the products being 50 per cent, of 
dextrin, about 50 per cent, of maltose and iso-maltose, and a very 



INTESTINAL DIGESTION 25 

littU' dextrose. Another enzyme called lactase converts lactose into 
galactose and dextrose, and is an important constituent of this 
secretion in suckling animals. 

Pancreatic juice alone has very little influence on proteins, but 
when mixed with succus entcricus its influence is great. It is 
believed that this is due to the effect of entero-kinase, which converts 
trypsinogen into trypsin. Trypsin differs from pepsin by acting 
in an alkaline medium. It successively converts the proteins into 
alkali-albumin, albumoses, peptones, polypeptides, and amino-acids. 
It acts more powerfully and rapidly than pepsin; it corrodes protein 
away, whereas pepsin swells it up ; it acts on insoluble proteins such 
as elastin; it carries the action farther than pepsin, the end-products 
being amino-acids. Fibrin affords a good example of its effects; it 
is converted to proteose (albumose) and peptones; the anti-peptone 
is believed to be absorbed as such, but hemi-peptone is reduced to 
amino-acids. Trypsin fibrin-peptone = Cj^H^gNgOg; it is split by 
hydrolysis into arginin, lysin, glutaminic and aspartic acids. 
Nucleo-proteins are split into protein and nucleic acid; the protein 
is digested, the nucleic acid reduced to purin bases and phosphoric 
acid. The cells of muscle, liver, and other organs, are dissolved 
and peptonized; but many nuclei resist the action of trypsin. 
Chondrin and gelatin are converted to gelatin-peptone. Elastin 
and cell-membranes in general are dissolved. Mucin is dissolved 
and reduced to amino-acids. Pancreatic rennin converts caseinogen 
into casein, which is digested by trypsin. Fats are split by lipase 
or steapsin into glycerin and fatty acids; the latter are saponified 
by alkaline salts, and the soaps are in turn utilized in the emulsifica- 
tion and absorption of other fats. The greater part of the fat in 
food is digested by pancreatic lipase, which is activated by the bile. 

The bile or secretion of the liver is constantly being manufactured ; 
but the pressure of its flow through the ductus choledochus varies, 
being lowest during abstinence from food, and highest two or three 
hours after a meal of carbohydrates or three or four hours after a 
meal of protein. Less secretion follows the ingestion of carbo- 
hydrates than after protein ; fatty foods were formerly supposed to 
check the secretion, but Barbera and Rosenberg have proved by 
experiments that fats cause an increased flow of bile, and olive-oil is 
a powerful cholagogue. Bile precipitates the proteins of the chyme, 
and the acidity of gastric juice is neutralized by its salts. Bile 
dissolves fatty acids, and especially oleic acid, about 50 per cent, 
of the food fats being dissolved by it ; it also activates the lipase or 
steapsin of pancreatic juice, and assists in the absorption of fat by 
lessening the surface tension of the molecules. The bile salts not 
only neutralize the gastric juice and precipitate proteins: they 
dissolve cholesterin, activate steapsin, moisten the intestinal 
mucous membrane, and render it permeable by fatty substances. 

The succus entericus is the secretion of the glands of Lieberkiihn. 
It contains quite a number of enzymes, including four which act 
on carbohydrates^ — -viz., amylase, found chiefly in the duodenum, 



26 THE DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION OF FOOD 

converts starcli inti> maltose; nialtase, wliirli converts maltose into 
dextrose; lactase, which occurs chiefly in the jejunum, converts 
lactose into galactose and dextrose; and invertase, which splits 
cane-sugar into dextrose and levulose. The proteolytic enzyme is 
erepsin; it has no action on native proteins, except casein, but it 
breaks down proteoses and peptones into amino-acids. The kinase 
converts trypsinogen into tr^'psin. The lipase of succus entcricus 
dissolves emulsified fat, and it is estimated that about 50 per cent, 
of the food fat is absorbed by virtue of this effect. 

The intestinal movements, like those of the stomach, have recently 
been studied by the aid of X rays. There are three kinds: (a) A 
penduluiu-like motion, consisting of a gentle swaying, rhythmical 
movement occurring in all parts of the intestines. These move- 
ments do not affect the whole gut at one time, but usually successive 
segments of the gut, and are most obvious in those parts which are 
distended with food at a period of three or four hours after the 
meal. Moreover, they are most energetic in the upper, and least 
so in the lower, parts of the gut, and naturally proceed from above 
downwards with the course of the food. The movement consists 
of lengthening and narrowing, followed by shortening and widening, 
of the canal; the contraction involves both the longitudinal and 
circular muscular coats, and in the course of its progress divides 
the bowel into man}^ segments. This movement breaks up the food, 
sways it backwards and forwards, diffuses the digestive fluids 
through it, and drives chyle into the lacteals. It is calculated that 
the mass in each segment of gut is di\aded, subdivided, and squeezed, 
about one thousand times, as the contractions occur at the rate of 
twelve per minute, {b) The second kind of movement consists of 
peristalsis, or wave-like propulsive movement, a localized dilatation 
followed by contraction of the canal, progressing from above down- 
wards at the rate of one or two inches per second, and is from two to 
three hours travelling the entire length of the intestine, (c) Under 
pathological conditions a third movement is observed, consisting of 
a swift vermicular movement, starting at the pylorus, and travelling 
the entire length of the gut in about a minute. It is produced by 
toxins, gases, and various irritants. 

Digestion is practically completed in the small intestine, for no 
digestive ferments are secreted in the colon, and the change in the 
chemical reaction hinders the action of enzymes already mixed in 
the foods. The colon is divided into three parts: A proximal 
portion, consisting of the caecum, ascending colon, and half the trans- 
verse colon ; a mesial part, formed by the other half of the transverse 
colon and part of the descending colon; a distal portion, fomied by 
the remainder of the descending colon and the rectum. The con- 
tents of the proximal part are fluid, and are subjected to feeble anti- 
peristaltic movements which last from two to three minutes, alter- 
nating with long periods of rest (twenty to thirty minutes). Food 
accumulates in this portion until it extends to the mesial segment; 
it is gradually concentrated by the absorption of water. When the

antiperistaltic inoxcnicnt has /^^onc on sonu' time, the c;ecuni bep^ins 
to contract periodically, and projx'ls tlie substance alonf< so that a 
portion is driven into the mesial portion, where the true peristalsis 
begins and carries it into the distal scpnent; here it remains until 
an evacuation occurs. It has been shown by the X rays that a 
meal reaches the caecum in four or five hours, the hepatic flexure 
in six or seven hours, the splenic flexure in nine hours, and the rectum 
in about eighteen liours. 

The fa.^ces consist of the residue of the food, digestive secretions, 
etc. The contents of the alimentary canal become altered in 
character as they descend its course. When it leaves the stomach, 
chyme is of a yellowish colour and creamy consistence; in the duo- 
denum the addition of bile changes its colour to greenish-grey; the 
mass attains a greater density as it descends, more and more nutri- 
ment being absorbed from it ; and even in the colon it becomes more 
solid, its colour brownish, and its odour characteristic. The residue 
of various foods in persons whose digestion is normal has been 
determined by actual experiment to be as follows: Proteins from 
meat 2-5, eggs 3, milk 11, bread 15 to 25, and vegetables 25 to 48, 
per cent.; carbohydrates from milk nil, bread 2 to 3, vegetables 
5 to 10, per cent. ; fat from i to 5 per cent., according to its origin. 
The amount of faeces from an average mixed diet represents one- 
seventh to one-eighth of the food consumed. It contains the fol- 
lowing: {a) Indiiicstihlc residues of food : Vegetable fibres, cellulose, 
chlorophyll, uncooked starch, gum, resin, mucin, nuclei of cells, 
connective-tissue fibres, elastic fibres, keratin, chitin, and insoluble 
salts, [h] Products of the decomposition of food : Amino-acids, fatty 
acids, insoluble soaps of calcium and magnesium, etc. (c) Bile 
residues : Stercobilin, choletelin, cholesterin, lecithin, {d) Bacteria, 
debris of intestinal matters, and other undigested substances. 

The Absorption of Food. — The products of digestion are brought 
into close relation with the mucous membrane by the muscular 
movements of the viscera. The stomach absorbs very little, and 
this consists of peptones, alcohol, and substances dissolved in dilute 
alcohol. Absorption occurs in the entire length of the gut, but 
attains a maximum in the ileum. How the substances of our food 
get out of the lumen of the gut into the blood and become a part 
of the living body is a matter of extreme interest. Several physical 
and physiological processes are involved in absorption. When 
two liquids of different densities are put together, they mingle with 
each other until the whole liquid is of the same density; this pro- 
cess is called diffusion. In like manner, if two liquids of different 
density are separated by an animal membrane, they mingle together 
by passing through that membrane until the fluid on each side 
is of the same density. This process is called osmosis : and the 
pressure at which the equilibrium is established is called the 
osmotic pressure. The osmotic pressure depends on whether the 
substance is an electrolyte or non-electrolyte. The osmotic pressure 
of non-electrolytes in solution is exac*^^ly proportional to the number 



a8 THE DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION OF FOOD 

of contained molecules; but in the case of electrolytes the osmotic 
pressure is in proportion to the molecules plus the ions in the solu- 
tion. Sugar is a non-electrolyte, and a i per cent, solution exerts 
exactly half the pressure of a 2 per cent, solution. Chloride of 
sodium is an electrolyte, and a i per cent, solution exerts more than 
half the pressure of a 2 per cent, solution, because the dissociation 
is greater and there are relatively more ions in the weaker than in 
the stronger solution. Osmosis is one mode of absorption by cells; 
it occurs in all animal and vegetable structures, and is an important 
element in biological processes. 

But absorption is not simply an osmotic process. This physical 
function is subject to modifications brouglit about by the living 
cells. The cells consist more or less of living protoplasm, by which 
diffusion is modified both as to the quantit}^ and quality of the sub- 
stances which pass in and out; and this is a vital phenomenon. 
One special phenomenon observed in living cells is the condition of 
turgescence; it is very important in connection with absorption. 
Three conditions are essential for its occurrence. One is an elastic 
cell-wall, which allows of variations in size of the cell; another is 
the presence in the cell of substances which attract water; and 
the third is the living protoplasm which controls the phenomenon. 
The turgidity itself is relieved by another vital phenomenon — the 
exhalation of water, carbon dioxide, and waste products of the cell. 
When a piece of gut is excised, and placed in defibrinated blood of 
the same animal, it will take up fluid into its mucous membrane, 
and the water and salts absorbed in this way have a tendency to 
move onward. Moreover, the epithelium has a direct selective 
affinity, even in the case of salts and water. The absorption of 
foodstuffs, therefore, is not merely a matter of dift'usion and 
osmosis, but is an effect of vital activity. 

It was formerly believed that the main stream of nutriment 
passed out of the intestines through the lacteals and thoracic duct 
into the circulation. But it is known now that only fats take 
that course, and that the dissolved proteins, carbohydrates, some of 
the fats, and salts, find their way into the circulation through the 
portal system and the liver. The proteins lose their colloidal 
character, are no longer coagulable, but are diffusible. It was 
formerly considered that proteins are absorbed almost entirely as 
proteoses and peptones, together with a small amount of unaltered 
serum-albumin, egg-albumin, and alkali-albumin. But neither 
proteose nor peptone can be found in the blood even when the diet 
is rich in protein; and if peptone be injected into the blood, it is 
rapidly excreted or broken down by ferments, and entirely disappears 
from the blood in ten to fifteen minutes. Neither is peptone found 
in the portal blood. It is therefore clear that the larger portion of 
protein does not enter the blood as proteose or peptone. The only 
remainingj^supposition is that the products of protein digestion are 
transformed into protein again before they reach the blood. This 
transformation is due to some vital process, as was proved by Hoff-

meister.* Polil also showed that the number of leucocytes in the 
blood increases rapidly during the digestion of protein, and that 
they are derived from the proliferation of lymph cells in the adenoid 
tissue of the alimentary canal; and their function is the assimilation 
of the products of protein digestion. But Heidenhain^ considers 
this explanation insufficient; he believes the digested proteins are 
taken up by the epithelial cells of the mucous membrane, and that 
in these cells the products of digestion are reconverted into proteins, 
and then surrendered to the blood-plasma in the capillaries imme- 
diately beneath the epithelium, and pass into the portal blood- 
stream. The discovery of erepsin in the succus entericus, and a 
study of its effects, has led to the view, now almost generally 
accepted, that the digestion of proteins is carried farther than the 
stage of proteoses and peptones — in fact, that this enzyme hydro- 
lyzes them into amino-acids, in which form they are taken up by 
the cells of the intestinal mucous membrane. The blood contains 
a constant proportion of serum-albumin and serum-globulin, which 
are constructed out of the amino-acids resulting from the digestion 
of protein-foods. The reconstruction of proteins takes place chiefly 
in the cells. Abderhalden and others assert that the cells of the 
intestinal mucosa take an active part in this reconstruction, and 
possibly in the supply of proteins to the blood. But it is probable 
that the proteins are not all reconstructed in the intestinal cells. 
Leathes found a definite increase of non-protein nitrogenous bodies 
in blood flowing in the vessels from the intestine. Von Bergmann 
found amino-acids in such blood. And on similar evidence Fuchs 
formed the opinion that amino-acids from the food arc carried to 
all the tissues; that the cells of the muscles and glands pick out 
from the blood the " building-stones " necessary for the construc- 
tion of their special proteins. There is also evidence of a local 
hydrolysis of serum-proteins to amino-acids by the cellular enzymes 
of the tissues, and that out of these amino-acids the tissue cells, 
construct proteins to their own pattern. 

All the amino-acids are not used for tissue-building. Those 
which are not directly used for constructive purposes are broken 
down ; the nitrogenous moiety is split off and converted to urea, and 
the carbon moiety is used for the production of energy. 

Fat is absorbed in the form of an emulsion and as a solution of 
soap. It was formerly thought that the greater part of the fat was 
taken up as an emulsion by the epithelial cells, and passed into the 
lymph stream, because an abundance of fat occurs in the thoracic 
duct after a meal. But the fat absorbed by the lacteals is not the 
whole of the fat from the food. When the amount of fat passing 
through the thoracic duct is compared with that in the food, there 
is a deficiency of nearly 50 per cent. It is clear, therefore, that at 
least 40 per cent, of the absorbed fat gets directly into the blood, 
being taken up as absorbable and soluble soaps, which are some-

30 THE DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION OF FOOD 

where resyntbetized into fat. It is not quite clear where this 
transformation occurs, but it is bebeved that it occurs directly in 
the cells of the intestinal epithelium. It was shown by Moore that 
after the ingestion of fat the mucous membrane contained 15 to 
35 per cent, of its fat in the form of fatty acid, while the lymphatics 
of the mesentery contain only 5 per cent, of their fat in this form. 
It is clear, therefore, that 95 per cent, of fat in the chyle had been 
regenerated before leaving the mucous membrane. According to 
Ptliiger, no unsplit fat is absorbed; it is all split into fatty acid 
and glycerine; and other authorities agree with him that the greater 
]>ortion of fat is taken up as fatty acid or soap, and synthetized 
into neutral fat. What becomes of it ? After a meal containing 
fat, the blood contains a considerable number of fat globules, but 
they soon disappear. These fat globules are so minute that they 
traverse the finest capillaries, and, passing through the capillary 
walls, are taken up by the cells in the connective tissues. The 
leucocytes in the blood also contain fat globules, which they have 
carried from the intestinal mucosa or taken up from the blood- 
plasma. F'at is not decomposed in the bloodvessels, for " oxida- 
tion never takes place in the blood," but it is carried by the blood- 
stream to the tissues all over the body; it is oxidized in the tissues 
to produce heat and energy; and what is not immediately used 
for this purpose is stored in the cells for future use. 

Carbohydrates arc chiefly absorbed as monosaccharides, such as 
dextrose, levulose, and galactose. The monosaccharides of the 
food are absorbed unchanged. The disaccharides are all inverted 
to monosaccharides — e.g., saccharose to dextrose and levulose, 
maltose to dextrose, lactose to dextrose and galactose. Poly- 
saccharides are converted by enzymes to maltose and dextrose, and 
the former again to dextrose. The absorption of uninverted carbo- 
hydrates is not improbable, for Otto and Von Mering separated a 
dextrin-like substance from the portal blood after a diet of carbo- 
hydrates. A portion of the ingested carbohydrates is destroyed in 
the alimentary canal by bacteria, whose enzymes transform them 
into various acids and gases. Practically all the carbohydrates 
digested are absorbed in the form of sugar. The absorption takes 
place more rapidly in the upper than the lower bowel; and the rate 
varies with the kind of sugar. Monosaccharides are completely 
absorbed and much sooner than disaccharides. The rate of absorp- 
tion of the latter varies with the time required for inversion ; cane- 
sugar is absorbed more rapidly than malt-sugar, and milk-sugar 
more slowly than either. The pentoses are absorbed much more 
slowly than hexoses; xjdose, one of the chief forms, nas to be 
split by hydrolysis from xylan (a pentosan of vegetable tissues) 
before it is absorbed. The polysaccharides — e.g., starch — are 
not so completely or rapidly absorbed as ready-formed sugars, 
because of the longer time required for transformation into mono- 
saccharides, the greater coarseness of the food, the presence of 
cellulose, etc. 



ABSORPTION 31 

Jlic Absorption of Sugar . — The sugars pass into the blood through 
the portal circulation, and not through the lymphatic vessels. The 
reason why they do not diffuse as freely into the lymphatic vessels as 
into the bloodvessels, according to Heidenhain,^ is due to the 
arrangement of the capillaries, close under the epithelium, which 
ordinarily take up water and all substances in solution — e.g., sugar, 
— in consequence of which they enter the portal vessels before the 
lymphatics. Where does the sugar go to after it gets into the blood ? 
The proportion of sugar in the general circulation is no greater after 
a meal than before it. An adult man has 5 litres of blood, con- 
taining 0-5 to 1-5 grammes, or possibly 2 grammes, of sugar per 
litre; so that at the most the blood never contains more than 
10 grammes of sugar. It is necessary, therefore, that there should 
be some means of storing it, for it cannot all be immediately used 
in the production of energy. Is it stored as glycogen ? Glycogen 
gradually disappears from the system during work and fasting, 
and rapidl}' increases after food, and it is assumed that carbo- 
hydrate is chiefly stored in this form. Bunge believes, however, 
that a considerable amount of carbohydrate is stored as fat. "The 
total amount of glycogen in the liver of man never exceeds 
150 grammes, and there is a similar store in the whole mass of 
muscles. This store is by no means all used up when a fresh 
supply of carboh3'drate is consumed, and it only disappears from 
the blood after weeks of starvation. ... It is evident, therefore, 
that only a small proportion of the carbohj^drate is laid down as 
glycogen, and we must assume the greater part of it is converted 
into fat."- Sugar is an important source of energy for the muscles, 
and provision is made for a sufficiency of it to be always present 
in the blood circulating through them, and the storehouse from 
which it is derived is the liver. \\'hen the liver and muscles con- 
tain enough glycogen to keep the blood supplied with it, the excess 
of sugar is converted into fat, and is reconverted into sugar when 
there is a demand for it. 

The amount of glycogen in the body depends on the amount 
and kind of food, and the state of rest or activity. It arises from 
the food, and, briefly put, carbohydrates give rise to most, proteins 
to some, and fats to no glj'cogen. Carbohydrates do not equally 
increase the glj^cogen: the hexoses cause the greatest increase; 
dextrose causes a greater increase than cane-sugar; and lactose is 
less effective than dextrose, levulose, cane-sugar, or maltose.^ 
Pentoses — xylose, arabinose, and rhamnose — also increase the 
glycogen. Polysaccharides increase the glycogen in proportion to 
the sugar produced from them. Glycogen is also increased by the 
ingestion of alcohol, glycerin, erj'thrite, sorbite, mannite, dulcite, 
inosite, quercite, etc. 

Fat of any kind has very little influence in causing an increase of

32 THE DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION OF FOOD 

glycogen in the body, although glycerin increases it. This is the 
general opinion ; but Bouchard and Desgrez^ state that the amount 
of glycogen in the muscles is certainly increased by the consumption 
of fat. 

Proteins increase the amount of glycogen in the liver. Kulz, 
Naunyn, von Mering, and others, observed an increase of glycogen 
after feeding animals with boiled beef, egg-albumin, serum-albumin, 
fibrin, casein, and gelatin. Casein and gelatin contain no gluco- 
protein, and Schondorff, Blumenthal, and Wohlgemeith, found no 
increase of glycogen after feeding with them. Pfliiger considers 
that only gluco-proteins cause an increase of glycogen. Most 
authorities believe that all proteins have this power, but they do 
not possess it in an equal degree. Various amino-acids, ammonium 
salts, and inorganic substances, increase the glycogen. 

There are several theories as to the cause of this accumulation of 
glycogen after the ingestion of substances. (i) The anhydride 
theory is that glycogen is an anhydride produced in the liver cells 
by separating water from sugar and causing its condensation 
{polymerization). (2) T/ie protein-sparing theory : according to this, 
carbohydrates are not the real source of glycogen; it arises from 
protein which is split into two parts, a nitrogenous part and a non- 
nitrogenous part, which is glycogen. (3) The theory of true glycogen- 
formers: that is, the carbohydrates are the true formers of glycogen ; 
the amount of glycogen ordinarily produced could not be formed 
from protein. Cremer^ says the true glycogen-formers are dextrose, 
levulose, galactose, and possibly mannose; other carbohydrates 
only cause the formation of glycogen when they are converted into 
these monosaccharides. 

There are two principal views concerning the after-history of 
glycogen: [a) Pavy's view that it is utilized for the formation of 
energy and heat without transformation into sugar; and {b) Ber- 
nard's view that it is transformed into sugar in the hver. Bernard 
formed his opinion from the belief that the liver always contains 
some sugar, and that there is more sugar in the blood leaving 
the liver than in the general circulation. Pavy denied this, and 
was supported by Schiff and Rittcr. Seegen, "Kaufmann, Tangl, 
Minkowski, and others, after excluding the liver from the circulation, 
found that the amount of sugar in the blood sunk to one-third or 
one-half the original amount, or disappeared entirely, in a few hours; 
which proved that the sugar was formed in the liver, and, as they 
believed, by its vital activity. 

The excess of carbohydrate in the body does not remain in the 
form of glycogen; it is probably converted into fat. There is no 
conclusive proof that fat is formed in the liver, but Bunge is of 
opinion that some sugar is transformed into fat in the liver. That 
fat accumulates in the body on a purely carbohydrate diet is proved 
beyond a doubt ; and the fomiation of fat from sugar is considered

Practical evidence of this transformation is found in tlie fact that 
cows give more fat in their milk than is contained in the grass they 
consume; and Gilbert and Lawes found that a pig accumulated in 
its body 472 parts of fat for every 100 parts of fat in the food. 
When the fat of the body is drawn on for supplying heat and 
energy, it is probably converted — at least, a part of it — into sugar 
before it is oxidized. 



ciiapti:r II 

THE HEAT VALUE AND DIGESTIBILITY OF FOODS 

One of the chict functions of the food is to supply the body with 
heat and energy. The amount of food required as fuel is ascertained 
by a study of the income and expenditure of the body on a par- 
ticular diet. As a general rule, people like to choose their own 
food, and eat as much as they feel disposed. Other people, with 
some special object in view, consume a diet in which protein, fat, 
or carbohj'drate, predominates. The amount of food required to 
supply the body with a definite quantity of heat or energy, however, 
cannot be determined by haphazard dietaries, such as the customary 
foods of certain classes of people. These dietaries are empirical, 
and may be valuable as a guide to the amount and kind of food 
usually consumed by people under various circumstances; but they 
are unreliable. The scientific proof that a given dietary is sufficient 
for the needs of man under particular circumstances has to be 
determined b}^ experiments in which the balance of nitrogen and 
carbon is determined. It has likewise been shown that the amount 
of nitrogenous substance required depends largely upon the supply 
of fats and carbohydrates. A diet rich in nitrogen, beyond a certain 
definite amount of digestible protein, has no greater value than 
an isodynamic quantity of fat or carbohydrate. As sources of 
energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate, can replace each other in the 
ratio of I : 2^ : I. These facts have been ascertained by experi- 
ments in which the income and expenditure of nitrogen and carbon 
were determined. They have likewise been confirmed bj^ burning 
numerous foods and the single constituents of foods in a bomb 
calorimeter. When completely oxidized by combustion, each 
gramme of dr\' material gives out a measurable quantity of heat. 
The amount of heat given off by a known weight of substance is 
fairly constant, and is called the heat value, or heat of combustion. 
The heat value is expressed in calorics; the term has been pre- 
viously explained. For the purposes of this book, the large calorie, 
or kilcalorie, will be used whenever it is possible to do so, except 
in quotations from other writings. The bomb calorimeter is an 
instrument which will measure the heat developed during the com- 
bustion of substances within it. The heat of combustion of various 
substances, as determined by the bomb calorimeter, is given in the 
following tables:

36 THi: HF.AT VALVF AND niCFSTIIULITY OF FOODS 

Heat produced in the Body by Food.— All non-nitrogciunis food- 
stuffs, whon conipU'toly digested, yield in our bodies tlie same 
amount of heat as in tlie calorimeter, the fnial products being the 
same. But the case of nitrogenous foodstuffs is different. Proteins 
are not completely oxidized in the body or reduced to the lowest 
grade of chemical composition. They are, moreover, split into a 
nitrogen-moiety and a carbon-moiety. The carbon-moiety is as 
completely oxidized in the body as in the calorimeter. The nitro- 
gen-moiety is not reduced to ammonia and water, the ultimate 
products of nitrogenous decomposition, but it is excreted as an 
organic compound, which in man is chiefly urea, and a smaller pro- 
portion of quaternary compounds (here called "meat bases"), 
which have a recognizable heat value. The calorific value of these 
excretory products, therefore, must be subtracted from the full 
heat value of nitrogenous foodstuffs as ascertained by the calor- 
imeter; the balance only represents the energy actually j-ielded to 
the bod\'. and it is known as the " physiological heat value." It 
may be stated as a general rule that each gramme of protein con- 
sumed results in the excretion of .'j gramme of urea. Therefore, to 
ascertain the heat value of protein in the body, we must subtract 
from the figures given in the table one-third of the heat or equivalent 

2-542 
of urea: — — = o-8i8 calorie; and for the small proportion of uric 

acid and other nitrogenous substances we may allow 0'i8 calorie, 
and subtract i-o large calorie from that given by the calorimeter. 
It is thereby ascertained that the energy or heat value of protein is 
little more than that of carbohydrates. Indeed, the heat value of 
carbohydrate foods is not quite the same as that determined by 
the calorimeter, and, with both protein and carbohydrate foods, 
depends upon the digestibility of the food or the amount of residue 
in the faeces. But as a store of energy, it may be considered that 
l)roteins and carbohydrates are of about equal value, the fats having 
about double the energy-producing capacity of the other two. 
The consideration of a large number of estimations of the heat pro- 
duced in the calorimeter and of the digestibility of various foods 
led Rubner ^ to fix their value approximately as follows (these 
figures are accepted by many observers as being fairly accurate, 
and they have passed into common use) :

The experiments of Rubner on animals also show that, as regards 
heat and energy, the vaiious foods may replace each other in exact 
ratio to the energy derived from them ; thus, 100 grammes of fat 
are isodynamic with 225 grammes of syntonin, 243 grammes of dried

muscle, 232 grammes of starch, 234 grammes of cane-sugar, and 
256 grammes of dextrose. That is to say, in round numbers, 
227 granunes of carbohydrate or protein are equal to or isodynamic 
with 100 grammes of fat, because they yield 930 calories on com- 
bustion in the body. This isodynamic law is of great value in prob- 
lems of nutrition and metabolism. Rubner also found by experi- 
ment that the heat produced in an animal's body corresponds 
almost exactly (to within 0-47 per cent.) with the heat calculated 
from the above factors. The heat value of a large number of foods 
in common use is given in the Tables of Composition in the introduc- 
tory chapter. These figures are sufficiently accurate for calculating 
dietaries for institutional or medical purposes. For making experi- 
ments in nutrition, the exact composition of the material in actual 
use should be determined by analj'sis. The factors of Rubner may 
then be used. But, in order to ascertain the physiological avail- 
ability of energy, the food should be burnt in a bomb calorimeter, 
and the figure obtained will be the gross heat value; from this must 
be subtracted the heat yielded by the urine and faeces by com- 
bustion; and the net will show the physiological availability of the 
energy. Rubner^ made many such experiments, and the following 
are examples of his results :

In order to become oxidized in the system and yield heat and 
energy, the food must be capable of digestion and absorption. 
Herein lies the exact value of any food to the consumer. It was 
formerly considered that the measure of digestibility of any food 
was the length of time it remained in the stomach, and freedom from 
discomfort during that time. In a normal condition of health, 
digestion is unattended by any feeling save comfort after food. It 
is only under abnormal conditions that the presence of food in the 
alimentary canal gives rise to other sensation ; it is then usually a 
pain referred to the stomach. 

Observations upon the time many foods remain in the stomach 
were made by Beaumont on Alexis St. Martin, who had a gastric 
fistula. His experiments were accepted for many years by various 
authorities; but the science of nutrition has shown man}' errors in 

1 Zcii.f. Biol., xlii. 



38 THE HEAT VALUE AND DIGESTIBILITY OF FOODS 

his reasoning and conclusions. Within recent years observations 
have been made by other men witli tlie object of ascertaining the 
length of time various foods remain in the stomacli. Penzoldt 
made observations on gastric digestion in healthy men. He used 
a tube for removing the contents of the stomach for examination. 
He found that the amount and consistence of the food had a marked 
influence on the time it remained in the stomach. Fluids leave the 
stomach more rapidly than solids. Seven ounces of water or other 
connuon beverages leave the stomach during the course of half an 
hour. Hot drinks do not leave quicker than cold ones, nor does 
the quantity imbibed appear to have much effect on its passage. 
Solid matters in solution or suspension delay the passage of the 
fluid somewhat; thus, 7 ounces of milk occupied two hours in its 
passage through the stomach. The consistence of other foods had 
a similar effect. Indeed, the consistence appears to have a greater 
effect than quantity in delaying the transit of the food ; the quantity 
necessarily influences the time occupied in gastric digestion and 
passage of the food through the pylorus, but the time so occupied 
is not proportionate to the amount . The table on pp. 40, 41, is com- 
piled from various sources. 

The Proportion of Food absorbed. — -Although the length of time 
a food requires to pass through the stomach is a valuable criterion 
of the ease or difficulty of its digestion, it would be a mistake to 
consider as " indigestible " all those foods which occupy the stomach 
for a longer time than others, or that they should be avoided by 
healthy people. On the other hand, this criterion is of decided value 
in cases of ill-health and in dyspepsia, if the processes of digestion 
are delayed or inefficient. The test of time occupied by its passage 
through the stomach refers only to the " apparent digestibility," 
while the test of " actual digestibility "is the amount absorbed. 
It has been truly said: " We live not upon what we eat, but upon 
what we digest." The term "digestibility," therefore, refers to the 
entire process of digestion, and not merely to that which occurs in 
the stomach. In this sense a " digestible food " is one of which 
the largest possible percentage is absorbed, and an " indigestible 
food " is one of which a considerable portion passes out of the 
system in the faeces, without being disintegrated and absorbed. 
The mode of determining the " actual digestibility " of a substance 
is as follows: {a} The total amount of the food consumed is noted, 
and the total amount of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, is cither 
determined by analysis of the food or by calculation from tables of 
composition, {b} The total weight of the faces afterwards excreted 
is ascertained, and the amount of nitrogen, fat, and carbohydrate, 
therein determined by analysis, (c) The difference in the con- 
sumption and the residue in the faeces is, roughly speaking, the 
amount digested and absorbed. To obtain the faeces from a 
particular meal or meals,' the consumer takes some blackberries, 
charcoal, or other substance, a few hours before the food whose 
digestibility is being tested, in order to make a dividing hue between 



PROTEIN ABSORPTION 39 

it and previously consumed food. The actual amount of nitrogen 
and fat in the fccces is not quite all derived from the food, since there 
is always a small amount of nitrogen tlicrein arising from metabolism 
in cells of the mucous membranes, from enzymes and bacteria. 

Nitrogen in Fcbccs due to Metabolism. — Faeces consist of the un- 
digested residue of the food, mucus from the walls of the intestines, 
epithelial cells, bacteria, colouring matter, cholesterin, salts of the 
fatty acids, bile, and other substances. It cannot, therefore, be 
contended that all the nitrogen in the fai'ces is derived from the food 
or from unmetabolized matter. That which comes from bile, mucus, 
and the debris of epithelial cells, has been metabolized, and formed 
a part of the nitrogenous material of the organism. It consists, in 
a way, of nitrogen which is accidentally lost. If no food is con- 
sumed, bile and mucus are still secreted, the epithelium continues 
to shed its cells, and bacteria flourish, and are e.xpelled with the 
faeces. Reider carried out experiments on a man with food free 
from nitrogen, which he ascertained to be well digested. The food 
consisted of a cake made of starch, sugar,, fat, and a little salt, 
leavened with cream of tartar and bicarbonate of soda; a little 
white wine and water were the only beverages; they were also free 
of nitrogen. It was consumed in sufficient quantity to secure a 
normal secretion of the digestive juices. Under these circumstances, 
it was assumed that any nitrogen in the faeces would arise from 
metabolic processes only. The average amount of nitrogen in the 
faeces during the experiment was 0-5 gramme per diem, and the 
conclusion is that this figure fairly represents the amount of nitrogen 
in the faeces arising from metabolism, and that anything above 
that amount is due to residues from the food. 

The total anion )it of nitrogen excreted in tlie fceces da.'\\y isnormaiWy r '^g 
grammes; and the amount of nitrogen in the faeces, less 0-5 gramme 
from metabolic products, is the measure of the indigestibility of 
the food or of the patient's inability to digest and absorb it. The 
larger the amount of nitrogen in the faeces, the less completely has 
the food been absorbed in the alimentary canal. It varies with the 
diet, being less on milk and eggs, and greatest on a purely vegetarian 
diet. Thus, with 4-5 litres of milk, containing 24-3 grammes of 
nitrogen, 217 grammes reappeared in the urine, and only i-i 
grammes in the faeces, the body retaining i -5 grammes. With a diet 
of peas, beans, bread, butter, and meat extract, containing 2 1 granmies 
of nitrogen, 15-5 grammes reappeared in the urine, 4-9 grammes 
in the faeces, and 0-6 gramme was retained by the body. But, given 
the same food regularly, the individual normally excretes the same 
amount of nitrogen daily in the faeces. This rule w-ith regard to 
protein absorption is therefore established : The nitrogen in the faeces 
(minus 05 gramme per diem) represents the residue of undigested 
protein in the food ; and the nitrogen in the food less that in the faeces 
(minus 0-5 gramme) is the measure of digested protein of the food. 

The amount of fat digested is usuall}' calculated as fat in the food 
minus the ether extract in the faeces. This is substantially correct.

4:: THE HEAT VALUE AND DIGESTIBILITY OF FOODS 

as very little fat except cholesterin leaves the body unnietabolized 
when once it lias been absorbed. TJic amount of carbohydrate 
absorbed is also calculated as that in the food minus that in the 
faeces. 

There is, however, another method of determining the digesti- 
bility of foodstuffs — viz., by artificial digestion. Stiitzer elaborated 
the system of artificial digestion to such an extent, with regard to 
proteins and carbohydrates, that he was able to ascertain their 
digestibility with results agreeing almost exactly with observations 
which included the actual consumption of the foodstuff and sub- 
sequent examination of the fa?ces. Pfeiffer confirmed many of 
these experiments by the former method. It is nmch simpler, but 
is not quite so reliable. 

Animal food is more completeh' absorbed than vegetable food, 
as shown by the difference between nitrogen in food and in faeces. 
Only a small proportion of protein in meat remains unabsorbed, 
but there is twice that amount left from milk, and a very much 
larger amuimt from vegetables. The average percentage of 
un-absorbed protein from various foods is as follows: Beef, 2-65; 
eggs, 2-q\ cheese, ^-^ (2-9 to 4-9); milk, 8-3 (6-5 to i2-o); bread — 
white, 22-4; wholemeal, 30-5; rye, 32-0.1 Another authority found 
the unabsorbed protein from white bread 20-0 ; brown, 42-5 ; and rye- 
bread, ^2-2.' Cereal flour, 9-4 (8-2 to 10-5); pea flour, bean flour, 
and lentil flour, 9-35; boiled lentils, 40-0.^ Macaroni, 11-2; vermi- 
celli, 17-1; maize, 10-5; rice, 20-4; potatoes, 32-2; carrots, 39-4; 
cabbage, 18-5; boiled peas, 22-25.* Broad beans, 30-25.-' Peas and 
bread, 16-0.^ Lentils, potatoes and bread together, 53-5.^

These observations were extended and confirmed by Atw-ater 
and Benedict. When animal food predominates in a meal, 97 per 
cent, of protein — that is, the highest proportion — is digested. 
\\'hen carbohydrate foods predominate, the digestibility of the food 
is the same as on ordinary diet. When fats predominate, the 
digestibility of fat is at its highest.

Atwater and his co-workers made a considerable number of ob- 
servations on digestion in healthy men. The food, urine, and faces, 
were analyzed, and the heat of combustion of the food, urine, and 
faeces, was determined in the bomb calorimeter. From their ob- 
servations they framed the following table:

The Digestibility of Meat. — Meat is one of the most digestible 
foods. As a general rule the residue from digested meat may be 
reckoned as 5 per cent.; 97 per cent, of protein and 98 per cent, 
of fat are absorbed. Roast chicken and veal are very tender, 
easily masticated, quickly disintegrated in the stomach, and pass 
into the intestines. Meat does not generally throw a great strain 
on the mechanical resources of the stomach. Mutton is digested 
quicker than beef, and pork slower than either; lean meat quicker 
than fat meat, and the flesh of young animals quicker than old 
ones. Cooking softens the tissues and favours digestion; but raw 
meat and underdone meat are digested somewhat quicker than 



44 THE HEAT VALUE AND DIGESTIBILITY OF FOODS 

cooked meat. Hanging the meat for a few days or a week favours 
digestion, bv allowing time for the lactic acid to soften the sarco- 
lemma of the tibres. Smoked meat is digested rather quicker, and 
canned nveats slower, than fresh meat. Chicken digests quicker 
than beef or mutton, because there is an absence of fat, the muscular 
fibres are shorter, the sarcolemma thinner, and the collagenous 
substances solti r. 

The Digestibility of Fish. — Long experience in prescribing for 
sick persons and invalids has resulted in placing in the following 
order the kinds of fish most suitable for them as regards apparent 
digestibility: Whiting, sole, plaice, flounder, fresh haddock, turbot, 
and cod. This order has been determined empirically. Whiting is 
well adapted for a weak stomach on account of the laxity of its 
fibres; haddock resembles it, but is firmer in texture; sole and plaice 
are tender, and their fibres are short and easily disintegrated ; 
turbot has more flavour, but is easily digested; cod has a denser 
fibre, and forms a line of division between light fish and those 
heavier and fatter kinds which are suitable for robust and healthy 
persons. Salmon, trout, halibut, mackerel, herring, shad, conger- 
eels, etc., contain more fat, possess firmer fibre, and are not so easily 
digested. Chittenden and Cumming found that fish in general is 
not digested so easily as meat, although several kinds are digested 
as easily as lamb or mutton ; they found fat fish less digestible than 
lean, with the exception of mackerel, which was quickly dissolved; 
but cod, which contains little fat, was the least digestible fish exam- 
ined by them. German observations showed that white-fleshed 
fish, oysters, and shellfish, leave the stomach in three hours — that 
is, in the same time as eggs, milk, and white bread; salt herrings 
left the stomach in four hours — that is, in the same time as 
roast beef, goose, smoked tongue, boiled peas, and lentils. Ac- 
cording to Penzoldt, smoked fish is digested more rapidly 
than unsmoked fish, owing to the condimental effect of the 
flavour. A comparison of the amount of protein and fat in fish 
consumed with that in the faeces shows that 97 per cent, of the 
protein and 90 per cent, of the fat, or a total of 95 per cent, of the 
fish, was absorbed. Those kinds of fish which contain a fair pro- 
portion of fat, such as the salmon and mackerel families, tunny, 
ling, and halibut, have a superior energy value, require a longer time 
for digestion than lean fish, and are a very efficient source of protein 
and energy for working men. 

The Digestibihty of Fat. — The undigested fat of the food is esti- 
mated as the ether extract from the faeces. Atwater found that 
95 per cent, of fat from all animal foods was absorbed, but only 
90 per cent, from vegetables. Rubner found only 80 per cent, of 
fat from beef, mutton, or horseflesh, was absorbed. Butter is well 
absorbed, the residue being only 27 per cent, when 8| ounces were 
consumed daily. Bacon is not quite so well absorbed, because the 
fat is enclosed in cells; from 7-5 to 17-4 per cent, escapes absorption. 
Butter, lard, margarine, and C(jd-liver oil, being free from cell- 



niGJisi jjuj.iry oi- eggs asd m/j.k 



45 



incinhranes, are almost completely digested. The fat of botf and 
mutton is more difficult of digestion, because it is enclosed in cells, 
and the surface tension of its globules is greater than in other fats. 

The Digestibility of Eggs. — -The absence of fibrous tissue and tough 
cellular membranes allords to eggs a digestibility which is un- 
surpassed, and is only equalled by a few foods, such as milk and 
oysters. Raw eggs are so bland that they make practically no 
demand on the stomach, neither vigorously exciting gastric secretion 
nor stimulating movement; in fact, they lie in the stomach rather 
longer than soft-boiled eggs, and escape into the duodenum very 
little altered. In the case of a man with a fistula near the pylorus, 
Bursch found that when raw eggs were taken by the mouth, quite 
half the substance passed through the pylorus unchanged. Pen- 
zoldt found that two raw, poached, or lightly boiled eggs leave the 
stomach in from two to three hours — i.e., in the same time as milk, 
oysters, light fish, and white bread. Hard-boiled eggs lie in the 
stomach longer, because the albumin is coagulated, and far more 
resistant than in the semifluid raw or soft egg. In artificial diges- 
tion experiments, hard-boiled eggs require eight hours for complete 
digestion, whereas soft-boiled eggs are completeh' digested in 
six and a half hours, raw eggs in four and a half hours, and whipped 
raw eggs in four hours. But the mode of cooking has no other 
effect on digestibility than to prolong the time; for they are as 
digestible as meat; an examination of the faeces after eating hard- 
boiled eggs showed that 95 per cent, of the total dry substance, 
including 97 per cent, of protein and all the fat, was absorbed. 
Eggs fully deserve the high position in which the}' are placed b}' 
physicians and physiologists. 

Eggs are usually innocuous ; but, owing to some idiosyncrasy, they 
are injurious to some persons by causing pain, cramp at the stomach, 
vomiting, or diarrhoea. It is not known what these effects are due 
to, but it has been thought that they may be due to the decomposition 
of lecithin into cholin, etc. Anybody ma\' be made ill by an excess 
of eggs, but the people referred to here are ill after consuming only 
a spoonful or two of an egg which is quite fresh. Neither are these 
symptoms due to ptomaine poisoning; the latter is due to the forma- 
tion of toxins by the entrance of putrefactive bacteria through the 
pores of the shell. Such poisoning is more likely to occur after the 
consumption of confections such as ice-cream, eclair, custard, or 
cake. Raw white of c^^ is used to a considerable extent in cookery, 
and, when combined with milk and sugar, forms an admirable 
culture medium for bacteria. The yolk of egg is less likely to cause 
serious trouble, because it is more often cooked. Eggs are influenced 
by food which the fowl consumes, and they are liable to contamina- 
tion by typhoid and other pathogenic organisms. 

The Digestibility of Milk. — Although one of the most completely 
digested of foods in a mixed diet, milk is not quite so completeh 
digested as meat or eggs. When milk is the sole food {milk diet], 
the prop(*rtion digested depends on the amount consumed; thus, 



46 



r///r HHAT VALUI-: AND DIGESTIBILITY OF FOODS 



Nvitli a consumption of ]^ pints daily the loss of milk solids varies 
from 57 to 7-5 per cent.; and with 5 pints daily the loss by non- 
digestion of milk solids varied from 10 to 11 -16 per cent. Atwater 
found milk better digested when it is part of a mixed diet; when 
consumed alone, the proportion digested was — Protein 92-1, carbo- 
hydrate 86-3, and fat 92-8, per cent. When milk and bread formed 
the diet, the amount digested was — Protein 97-1, carbohydrate 987, 
and fat 95-0, per cent. 

Young children digest milk more completely than adults; up 
to four years of age the loss of protein by non-assimilation is only 
4-5 per cent., but in health}' adults the loss may be 11 per cent., 
and more in a dyspeptic person. The fat absorption, too, varies 
with age; Camerer found that up to ten or twelve years of age the 
loss in the faeces was 2-8 per cent., and in adults Rubner found a 
loss of 4-6 to 7*2 per cent, of fat. Sterilization of milk slightly 
lowers its digestibility; Listov found the quantitative metabolism 
of sterili/rd milk was 91-8 per cent., and of raw milk 93"6 per cent. 

The Digestibility of Bread. — Bread is readily digested. White bread 
digests quicker than brown or black bread, and biscuits (crackers) 
quicker than either of them ; this is probably due to a difference in 
the texture and size of the particles of flour, and is well shown in 
the following table by Snyder:

Penzoldt's findings are given on p. 41. It was also found by 
Rubner that when 600 grammes (21 J ounces) of bread were con- 
sumed daily the amount undigested equalled 4-0 per cent, of the 
dry substance of white bread, 6-6 per cent, of second quality (baker's 
grade), and 12-23 per cent, of that in brown bread. The amount of 
best bread lost or undigested equalled 20-0 per cent, of the nitrogen, 
447 per cent, of the fat, and i-io per cent, of the carbohydrate; 
in seconds bread the amount undigested contained 24-5 per cent, 
of the nitrogen, 63-8 per cent, of the fat, and 2-57 per cent, of the 
carbohydrate; in brown bread the undigested portion contained 
30-0 per cent, of the nitrogen, 51-1 per cent, of the fat, and 7-37 per 
cent, of carbohydrate. These figures, and those in Snyder's table 
clearly prove that white bread made from first or second patent 
flour (patent grade and baker's grade) is superior as a source of

[irotcin, curboliydratc, and I'lu-rgy. I lu- ditference of lo per cent, 
in the available energy and digestible nitrogen settles the question 
of brown versus white bread in favour of the latter. The fact that 
brown bread contains a tritie more protein and fat is no proof of its 
superiority; on the other hand, the loss of 30 per cent, of nitrogen 
and 50 per cent, of the salts is quite against it; even germ bread, 
consisting of white flour with 7 or 10 per cent, of germ from other 
wheat, is no better than white bread, the amount digested being 
protein 90, carbohydrate 97'6, per cent. 

With rye bread the loss of protein varies from 25 to 40 per cent. — 
i.e., only Oo to 75 per cent, is digested; but the carbohydrates are 
well digested, and 85 per cent, or more of the total energy is avail- 
able. Black bread made with buckwheat is even less easily digested 
than rye bread, because the seeds contain 11 per cent, of cellulose, 
and are on a par with dried k\gunu'S. 

Tile Digestibility of Macaroni, Vermicelli, and Noodles.- — These sub- 
stances contain 11 to 13 per cent, of protein, 75 to 78 per cent, of 
carbohydrate, and only 0-35 per cent, of cellulose. They are 
eminently digestible, only about 4 per cent, of the dry substance 
escaping absorption, which includes 10 per cent, of the nitrogen. 
They are useful foods in stricture of the bowels and other diseases, 
wluTc it is desired to have only a small residue of food. 

The Digestibihty of Maize, Oatmeal, Rice, Sago, and Tapioca. — The 
general rule for cereals is that 85 per cent, of protein, 90 per cent, 
of fat, and 98 per cent, of carbohydrate is absorbed. Corn starch, 
cornflour, sago, tapioca, and arrowroot, consist chiefly of starch, and 
are almost entirely absorbed. Maize-meal, oatmeal, rice, and millet, 
in general, follow the rule given above. 

Maize is an important food of the peasantry in many parts of the 
earth. It is a very useful source of carbohydrate and fat, and the 
experiments of many observers show it is well digested. As regards 
nitrogen, it is somewhat deficient. Observations on the food of 
poor healthy peasants in Italy were made by Albert! and Vovi. In 
winter their diet consisted of polenta, soup, herrings, and fat, and 
the nitrogen balance was deficient to the extent of i gramme a day. 
In summer they ate bread, mutton, cheese, and fish, and they gained 
5 grammes of nitrogen daily. Polenta is made of maize-meal, 
sometimes with chestnut-meal, and milk. The deficiency in the 
winter dietary was probably due to shortness of milk. 

Oatmeal, barley-meal, and other cereals which are not ground 
very fine, do not digest so easily as wheatflour. But much depends 
on the mode of cooking. Oatmeal gruel is digested easier and more 
completely than oat-cake, but when it is consumed with a sufii- 
ciency of milk it forms a complete diet. 

Millet, sorghum, and durra, staple foods of the peasantry in 
Oriental countries, are not digested easily; only 40 to 45 per cent, 
of the protein was absorbed in an observation made by Kurchenino\- 
on three healthy persons. It is found, however, sufificient energy is 
derived from a diet in which millet predominates. 



48 THi: in AT VAl.Vr. AXD DTGESTIBILITY OF FOODS 

Rico is another ciMval of groat ocononiic importance. It forms 
a staple food for millions of people. Ordinary polished rice contains 
only 0-3 per cent, of cellulose, and almost all the substance of the 
grain is absorbed, including all the carbohydrate and 80 to 81 per 
cent, of the protein. As a food for invalids it possesses a high 
value on account of its digestibilit}-. The starch granules are 
exceedingly small, and readily transformed into sugar. It is ab- 
sorbed chiefly in the upper bowel, and very little residue reaches 
the colon. This makes it of immense value in intestinal diseases, 
where it is desirable to have little residue from the food. 

Sago, tapioca, and arrowroot are also very digestible; they 
contain ver}' little protein and fat, and 98 per cent, of the carbo- 
hydrate is absorbed. These root starches are digested more 
quickly than the cereal starches. In some artificial digestion ex- 
periments Grierson found the time required for complete digestion 
of wheat, maize, and rice was two hours; oatmeal, eighty minutes; 
tapioca and sago, thirty minutes; arrowroot and potato starch, ten 
minutes. Penzoldt found, however, that a gruel made of i^ ounces 
of tapioca did not leave the stomach entirely in less than two and 
three-quarter hours; but this quantity, it should be observed, would 
make a large pudding, and be far more than an}' person would take 
at an ordinary meal. Grierson concluded from his experiments 
that, for persons with weak digestion, tons les mois, arrowroot, and 
potato puree are the best carbohydrates, and after these tapioca and 
sago. Puddings made of these substances usually contain milk, 
sugar, and butter, which add considerable protein and fat to the 
mixture. They are usually well and easily digested, are fairly well 
balanced and typical representative foods, suitable alike for invalids, 
the aged, and children. 

The Digestibility oJ Legumes. — Leguminous seeds justly occupy 
a high position as a source of proteins. Judging by analysis alone, 
they contain more of these principles than the best cuts of meat. 
A generation ago Moleschott pronounced them to be " true treasure- 
houses for the renewal of our blood, peas being equal to veal, beans 
to poultry, while lentils leave every kind of meat far behind." But 
it is questionable if an}' individual could consume enough of them 
daily to supply the needs of the organism. 

Peas have been investigated by many men. Rubner found that 
i^ pounds (600 grammes) of dried peas would be required daily to 
maintain the nitrogen balance in equilibrium, and 2 pounds 
(960 grammes) to supply energy. When 2 pounds were consumed, 
72 per cent, of protein, 25 per cent, of fat, and 93 per cent, of the 
carbohydrate were absorbed; when i| pounds were eaten, 83 per 
cent, of the protein, 36 per cent, of fat, and 96 per cent, of carbo- 
hydrate were absorbed; the loss of protein, therefore, was from 
17 to 28 per cent., although the peas were well cooked and ruhhed 
through a sieve. Most observers agree with these findings, but 
Striimpell gave the opinion that the digestibilitv depends on the 
kind of water used in cooking, and stated that the calcium and

niagncsiuiu salts of luird water lorin insoluble compounds of protein 
which are not easily dissolved in the digestive secretions. Richter 
confirmed this experiment by finding that, when 600 grammes of 
peas were consumed after boiling in distilled water, 90 per cent, of 
protein and 88 per cent, of fat were digested. This suggests that 
carbonate of soda used in cooking might neutralize the effect of 
calcium and magnesium salts, and that rain water would entirely 
prevent it. Moreover, the loss of protein is not so great when peas 
form part of an ordinary mixed diet — e.g., pea soup. In such a 
case Striin;pell found only 8 or 9 per cent, remained undigested 
after the consumption of 7 ounces (200 grammes) of dried peas. 

Beans have about the same digestibility as peas. Prausnitz fed 
i^ pounds of cooked white navy beans to a man for three days in 
succession, and found 15 per cent, of the total dry matter, including 
30 per cent, of the protein, was not absorbed. Oshima experimented 
with dried soya beans, and found 35 per cent, of the protein un- 
absorbed. 

Lentils vary in digestibility according to the mode of cooking. 
Striimpell tried them on himself, and found, when he consumed 
7 ounces a dd^y, 40 per cent, of the protein reappeared in the faeces. 
When they were ground to flour and consumed as part of an ordinary 
meal, only 10 per cent, of protein escaped digestion. Hard water 
interfered with their digestion, and distilled water favoured it. 

As part of a mixed diet, all kinds of legumes are better digested 
than when they are consumed alone. Wait records a number of 
observations on mixed diet, and found 80 to 90 per cent, of the 
protein of peas was digested. Snyder also found that 80 per cent. 
of protein and fat, and 96 per cent, of the carbohydrate, were ab- 
sorbed from white navy beans. 

The Digestibility o£ Vegetables. — Vegetables are less easily digested 
than animal food, because the material is enclosed in cells composed 
of cellulose, which prevents the digestive secretions getting access 
to the nutrients; moreover, vegetable foods are prone to fermenta- 
tion, wliich increases peristalsis and hurries them along the canal 
before they have time to be absorbed; even the cellulose adds to 
this effect by acting as a local irritant. 

Potatoes. — In European countries potatoes rank next to bread. 
This arises from the easiness of their digestion. Observations have 
shown that 5. I ounces (150 grammes) of potatoes, boiled and eaten 
in the usual way, pass through the stomach in two to two and a half 
hours. Mealy potatoes digest quicker than waxy ones, and mashed 
quicker than unmashed ones. From 92-5 to 95 per cent, of the 
starch, the chief ingredient, is absorbed; but there is a loss of 
23 per cent, of protein. The loss of nitrogen is of little account in 
a mixed diet; the quantity in the tubers is very small, and half of 
it is amide — e.g., asparagin. The amide-nitrogen is of no nutritive 
value, but it is a stinmlant to enzyme action, a disinfectant, and 
promotes the absorption of proteins and carbohydrates. 

As regards economic value, potatoes are not suitable for the sole 

4 



so THE HEAT VALUE AND DIGESTIBILITY OF FOODS 

food of people, owing to the (ieticieney in protein and fat. Aecord- 
ing to Atwater, 7 pounds of potatoes would contain 60 grammes of 
protein and yield 3,080 calories of energy, and, when absorbed, 
would be enough for a woman or man without work. But, as 
Jj per cent, of the protein is lost, there is a marked deliciency of 
nitrogen. The bulk of such a diet would be too much for most 
people; but with a combination of milk, butter, and eggs, the 
quantity could be reduced. Snyder found 3^ pounds of potatoes, 
eight eggs, I pint of milk, and a little cream, would afford an ade- 
quate dietary and give a slight gain of nitrogen to the body. 

Carrots, Turnips, Parsnips, and Beetroots, are chiefly of \alue 
for their fresh juice containing mineral salts. The nitrogen is 
small. For instance, beetroot contains onl}- 2 per cent., including 
0-66 of protein-nitrogen, 0-58 of amide-nitrogen, and 07O per cent, 
as ammonia and nitrates. The protein in beetroot = o-66x 6-25 = 
4-12 per cent., the carbohydrates 15 to 18 per cent., and cellulose 
3 per cent. Carrots and parsnips contain 10 per cent, of sugar, but 
turnips have only 5 per cent, carbohydrate, chiefly pectose. When 
cooked, these roots lose half their soluble contents, and the re- 
mainder is neither quickly nor completely digested; 5^ ounces of 
boiled carrot required three and a half hours to pass out of the 
stomach, and only 61 per cent, of the protein, 79 per cent, of the 
carbohydrate, and 64 per cent, of the minerals, were absorbed. 

Greoi Vegetables. — The composition of the conmion vegetables, 
both raw and cooked, is given in the introductory chapter. The 
protein is very small, and the fat, when most abundant, is objection- 
able and disturbs the digestive organs. The most important con- 
stituents are carbohydrates and salts. When boiled, all vegetables 
lose one-third of these constituents. Nevertheless, green vegetables 
are rightly held to be important articles of food. The salts of alka- 
line earths and metals supply the body with elements essential to 
the maintenance of sound health. Common experience shows that 
abstinence from them tends to various blood and skin diseases. 
Their digestibility depends largely on the amount of cellulose. In 
young rajjidly-growing plants this is small, and they are digested 
well and easil}-. In slow-growing plants there is much more cellu- 
lose, some cells being coated with ligno-cellulose, which renders 
"them useless to the human body. 

Fruit and Nuts. — Very few observations have been made on the 
digestion of fruit alone, but there are many on fruit and nuts. 
Beaumont found that uncooked sour apples require two hours to 
pass through the stomach, and ripe sweet apples one and a half 
hours. Another observer found 5 ounces of raw ripe apples passed 
out of the stomach in three hours, but unripe ones required a much 
longer time. These may be taken as a fair sample ol the digestion 
of fruit in the stomach. Cooking softens the cellulose and gums, 
and some of the pectose assumes a gelatinous form, whereby cooked 
fruit is able to pass out of the stomach more easily than raw fruit. 
Little is known of the length of time required for digestion of fruit

in the bowels, but there is evidence to show that they are digested 
to the extent of 75 per cent, of protein, 86 per cent, of fat, 95 per 
cent, of carbohydrate, 78 per cent, of the woody fibre, 54 per cent. 
of ash; and 80 per cent, of the energy is available. The carbo- 
hvdrates form the chief nutriment in fruit, and 75 per cent, of it is 
a mixture of dextrose and lacvulose; the rest consists of starch, 
dextrin, gum, pectin, and pentosans, the latter being more or less 
transformed into pentose sugars during ripening. The salts are 
organic acids in combination with potassiimi, sodium, and earthy 
>alts. which are transformed chiefly into alkaline carbonates in the 
alimentary canal. The aperient effect of fruit is due to the local 
action of the organic acids, and partly to the cellulose. 

Nuts are a valuable source of protein and fat, but they are not 
so easily and completely digested as fruit, because a dense network 
of cellulose pervades the kernel. Tlu}' are more difficult of mastica- 
tion, and the cellulose prevents the access of digestive ferments to 
the materials in the cells. Their digestibility and availability is 
shown in the table on p. 51. 



chaptj:r III 

METABOLISM 

Life consists, as far as material phenomena are concerned, in the 
transformation of matter and energy. To these transformations 
the term metabolism is applied. In the metabolism of matter the 
changes are chemical; in energy the changes are physical. It is 
commonly assumed that the laws of conservation of matter and 
energy are conformed to or obeyed in animal bodies. This has not 
been demonstrated to universal satisfaction, but a gradual approach 
to such demonstration has been made in recent years. The body 
can neither create nor destroy matter, and whatever energy it 
receives is apparently given off or retained without diminution. 

It would be impossible here to go into a history of the science of 
nutrition. As early as the seventeenth century it was believed 
food is to the body what coal is to a fire ; but it was not until 1789 
that Lavoisier enunciated the process of oxidation and declared 
combustion in the animal organism is similar. The study of 
metabolism was much enlarged by Liebig, who made man}^ observa- 
tions. Much good work has since been done by a long list of 
workers. 

The body converts potential into kinetic energy by metabolism 
in the body. The potential energy of the food is transformed into 
the actual energ}' of heat and mechanical labour. In this respect 
there is no difference between man and other vertebrates; the 
details may vary, but the end-products are the same. The only 
difference is in the nervous and intellectual processes, which is not 
yet understood. 

Metabolism is anabolic and katabolic. Anabolism is construc- 
tive; it includes growth and the act of the tissues in selecting, 
appropriating, and making substances absorbed from the alimentary 
canal a part of themselves. The body is never stable ; while growth 
and nutrition progress, destruction or demolition is taking place, 
and this is called kataholism. To ascertain the exact amount of 
matter and energy used daily by the body, a balance-sheet of the 
exchange of material is necessary. The income consists of — 
(a) Matter : Food, drink, and oxygen of the air. {h) Energy : 
The potential energy of the food and drink. The outgo consists of — 
(a) Matter in the urine, faeces, perspiration, and breath. (6) Energy: 
The potential energy of faeces, urine, products of respiration and 
perspiration. \ complete account would show the amount of

These results, now classical, have never been impugned; but the 
tables are not so complete as modern tables. Moreover, the results 
derived from the experiments are better, perhaps more exact, when 
the observation is made on a body in a respiratory calorimeter. 
Such a chamber has been used by many observers. But few have 
carried their experiments out with the completeness of those con- 
ducted by Atwater and his co-workers from 1897 to 1907, and his 
successors to the present time. In their observations a man is 
usually selected in a state of good health, whose digestion is normal, 
and who is not uncomfortable during confinement. A palatable 
diet is selected; it is well cooked, accurately sampled, and carefully 
analyzed. The quantity of nitrogen and carbon is such as to keep 
the body in equilibrium during work or rest, according to the con- 
dition to be observed. A preliminary digestion experiment is made 
for four days prior to the observation, and during that period any 
change deemed desirable in the food is made, until an equilibrium 
is established. During these preliminary days the mar^ rests or 
works, as he will do in the respiratory calorimeter. A summary of 
some of the observations is given in the table on p. 55. 

All experiments show that the body has considerable power of 
adapting the output of nitrogen to the income, and this power is 
exercised within very wide limits. The quantity of protein 
katabolized cannot be taken as an exact measure of the permanent

demands of the body, nor as a measure of tlie average demand of 
a man doing work; but experiments show tliat the body requires 
a given quantity of energy-producing substance for sustenance, 
and something more to meet the demands for muscular work. In 
a rest experiment extending over forty-five da3's, the net income 
was 2,255 calories, and the net expenditure 2,250 calories; and 
during a period of light work extending over sixty-five days the 
net income was 2,690 calories, and the net expenditure 2,682 
. alories. The elimination of energy during fortj'-five days of rest 
was determined to be as follows: By radiation and conduction from 
the skin and lungs 1,669, ""> "rine and faeces 31, in water evaporated 
from the lungs 550 — total 2,250 calories; during twenty days of 
work the heat eliminated by radiation and conduction from skin 
and air in lungs 2,777, "^ urine and faeces 19, in water evaporated 
from lungs 1,126, by muscular work 234 — total 3,656 calories. 

The amount of carbon dioxide excreted by the body has alwa3's 
been considered a measure of the energy expended. Parkes found 
that a man of 150 pounds weight during rest gives off 15 cubic feet 
of carbon dioxide in twenty-four hours, and that the production of 
I cubic foot of gas b}^ combustion involved the expenditure of 
160 foot-tons of energy, and 15 cubic feet 2,400 foot-tons of energy, 
which is equivalent to about 1,560 calories. He found the excre- 
tion of CO2 during rest was 0-62 cubic foot per hour, during hard 
work 1-66, and laborious work 275, cubic feet. Atwater and 
Benedict also found the elimination of CO2 varied with the con- 
ilition. During rest and fasting it averaged 676, rest with food 
<Si2, work with carbohydrate diet 1,820, work with fat diet 1,665, 
and work with mixed diet 1,475, grammes daily. According to 
Parkes's figures, the energy expended daily during rest was 1,600 
calories, during moderate work 2,600, and during hard work 3,200, 
ralories. Playfair obtained similar results. In more recent times 
Zuntz found the expenditure was as follows:

The Respiratory Quotient. — The amount of oxygen utilized in the 
oxidative processes of the body is of great importance, and in ex- 
periments on metabolism should be carefully detennined. In an 
observation on a man at rest and consuming ordinary diet for four 
days, Atwater and Benedict found the total income of oxygen in 
food and drink was 7,523 grammes; the total outgo was 10,712 
grammes. The difference was 3,189-5 grammes, of which 4337 
grammes was contained in body substance consumed during the 
obsers'ation. This leaves 2,756 grammes of oxygen, or 689 grammes 
daily over and above the amount in food and drink, and represents 
the quantit}' received from the air.

Tlie respiratory quotient is the most delicate test of the car- 
bonaceous metabohsm of the organism; it is the ratio of the COg 
exhaled to the oxygen consumed. It varies with the diet and rest 
or work. These facts are shown in the following table from experi- 
ments bv Atwater and Benedict:

The respiratory quotient is determined by dividing the CO2 ex- 
haled by the Oj consumed; i litre of COg weighs 1-9642 grammes, 
and I litre of O2 weighs 1-4286 grammes, and the corresponding 
factors are 1-^1-9642 = 0-5091, and i-=- 1-4286 = 0-7. The amount 
of CO, exhaled by a man in one experiment lasting several days

=0-857, the respiratory quotient. 



The influence of food on the respiratory quotient has been studied 
by many men. There is always an increase of respiratory activity 
after meals, greater in proportion to the amount, and greatest about 
an hour after the heaviest meal. All substances rich in carbon 
increase the output of CO2. A purely carbohydrate diet is only 
possible for a short period, but during that time the respiratory 
quotient rises to unity or nearly so. An excess of fat lowers the 
respiratory quotient, but increases the output of COg. -\lcohol, 
tea, and ethereal oils, diminish the output of COg. In herbivora, 
living largely on carboh^'drates, the oxygen consumed reappears 
chiefly in the excreta as CO,, and the respiratory quotient is usuallv 
0-9, or nearly unity. In carnivora, living chiefly on proteins and 
fat, more oxygen leaves the body in the form of water, and less as 
CO2; consequently the respiratory quotient sinks, and is usuallv 
about 0-6 or 0-7. In hibernating animals the respiratory quotient 
sinks lower than in any other known condition, being frequently 
less than 0-5, because the animal lives almost entirely on its own 
fat. Rest causes a fall in the respiratory quotient to about 0-7 or 
0-8, but muscular activity causes a great increase in the intake of

oxygen and output of COj, especially the latter, and the respiratory 
quotient rises to o-8, or even 0-9. 

The metabolism of nitrogtMi is usually measured b}' tlie amount 
of urea in the urine, taking into account the small proportion of 
uric acid and other nitrogenous bodies. In addition to this, an 
average of 0-5 grannne of nitrogen per diem is excreted in the fieces. 
\'oit taught that all the nitrogen was excreted in the urea and faeces: 
but there are other excreta which contain it. An experiment on 
seven Pluropeans and five Malays by Eijkmanni showed that the 
amount of nitrogen in the perspiration varies with that excretion. 
but averages about i gramme per diem. Charles found perspira- 
tion contains urea, epithelial cells, and nitrogenous fats, and con- 
tained o-o8 per cent, of nitrogen. 

The Effect of Pasting on Metabolism. — The organism lives on its 
own tlrsh and fat. In an cxjicriment by Benedict on a man during 
seven days' fast, the loss was estimated to be — -Protein 69-5, fat 139-6, 
glycogen 1^, grammes, per diem, yielding 1,597 calories. The loss 
of protein corresponded to 347 grammes of flesh; the actual loss 
of energy measured by the calorimeter was 1,696 calories per diem, 
or 100 grammes more. The heat of combustion can be calculated 
from the known heat value of the substances, i gramme of body 
protein yielding 5-65 calories, and i gramme of fat 9-54 calories 
and the total when fully oxidized would amount to 1,734 calories. 

The Effect of Nitrogenous Diet on Metabolism. — The most striking 
effect of a purely nitrogenous diet is a large increase in the nitrog- 
enous metabolism, but it also increases the metabolism of the non- 
nitrogenous elements of the body. With an ordinary mixed diet 
the normal excretion of urea varies from 33 to 37 grammes a day, 
and with a meat diet the urea excretion may rise to 50 or even 
80 grammes daily. From this circumstance Voit concluded that 
the proteins which increase the urea excretion are not really built 
up into the tissues, and he divided the proteins in the body into 
" tissue proteins " and " circulating or floating proteins." The 
former are those converted into cellular elements, and the latter 
speedily undergo metabolism and liberate their energy in the fonn 
of heat. The establishment of a nitrogenous equilibrium does not 
mean that the body neither gains nor loses weight. When the 
meal required to balance the nitrogen is a large one, although there 
may be no retention of nitrogen, the body may gain weight by 
laying on fat. The amount of fat stored up may be more than that 
consumed, and we are driven to the conclusion that in such a case 
the protein is split into a urea moiety and a fatty moiety, and that 
the urea moiety is mostly discharged as urea, while the fatty moiety 
is used as an energy-producer, or the excess stored up as adipose 
tissue. This disruption of the protein molecule explains the rise 
in nitrogenous excretion which constantly and proportionately 
follows the consumption of proteins. 

It is not quite clear where the transformation of protein takes

NfTROGENOUS DIET 59 

place. Buixlun - Sanderson ' said: " I'hc pnulnclion oi urea and 
other nitrogenous metabolites is exclusively the function of living 
material." Michael Foster- and Hoppe-Seyler^ say we can make 
no distinction between " tissue protein " and " floating protein." 
All proteins consist of amino-acids, and our knowledge of these has 
been increased in recent years. It is now considered that all 
proteins undergoing digestion are broken down to amino-acids in 
the alimentary canal, and reconstructed into proteins in the epi- 
thelial cells of the mucous membrane. Thence they are trans- 
ported in the blood and lymph streams to cells all over the body, 
and these cells again break down the proteins to amino-acids, and 
out of these acids construct proteins to their own pattern. But 
all cells do not require the same kind or quantity of amino-acids. 
The surplus is thrown off, re-enters the lymph or blood stream, 
and is carried to the liver, where it is transformed into urea, giving 
off heat and energj^ in each stage of the downward course. The 
consumption of protein provokes metabolism in the living cells, 
and the more protein consumed, the greater will be the amount of 
urea excreted. It seems as if the cells, like gourmands, develop an 
appetite according to the supply, and the rapid exchange of material 
causes a corresponding output of nitrogenous waste. 

It is possible for an excessive consumption of protein to lead to 
the storage of protein in the cells of the liver and other tissues, 
and this " stored protein," although enclosed in the cells, is not a 
part of the living protoplasm. " Tissue protein," on the other 
hand, is that which has become an integral part of the protoplasm 
of the cells. It is considered that stored protein is broken 
down with comparative ease, while tissue protein is much more 
stable. 

When the food contains enough protein for the purposes of 
ordinary metabolism, very little tissue protein is broken down; in 
fact, the destruction of tissue protein which occurs in normal cir- 
cumstances is represented only by the waste nitrogen arising from 
the breaking down and regeneration of cells. Even during fasting 
very little tissue protein is broken down. The proteins of the food 
and stored proteins are broken down very readily, while the organism 
makes every effort to protect tissue proteins from destruction. 
The tendency of the organism to metabolize only consumed pro- 
teins (stored proteins and food proteins) is chiefly noticeable when 
(i) the protein of the food is excessive, (2) the daily supph^ of 
nutriment is taken in several meals, (3) and during nutrition after 
fasting. In metabolism experiments, it is not enough to deter- 
mine the income and outgo of nitrogen; the income and outgo of 
phosphoric acid must also be determined, and the ratio of phos- 
phoric acid to nitrogen in the urine: for these factors alone sliow 
whether tissue proteins or food and stored ]iroteins are broken

phosphoric acid to nitrogen and nitrogen to sulphur is as follows:

As the ratio of these elements in the protein of foods differs, so 
the ratio of these elements in the urine will differ with the kind of 
food consumed and with partial or complete fasting. Kolpakcha 
found, when the body is in nitrogenous equilibrium, the ratio of 
PoO, to X is the same in the urine as in the food; but when there 
is a deficiency of food the ratio alters, and in fasting — i.e., when 
the body consumes its own proteins — the ratio of P2O5 to N is 
r to 39 or 4-1. On the first day of fasting stored protein is me- 
tabolized; when this becomes exhausted, the organism gradually 
approaches a condition when it must consume its tissues; after a 
few days' fasting, the phosphoric acid and nitrogen will be entirely 
derived from the cleavage of tissue protein, and the ratio of P2O5 
to N will be as i is to 3-9 or 4-1, and is practically stationary at 
I : 4. The great problem of nutrition, therefore, is the protection 
of tissue proteins from destruction, and it is as important as re- 
building degenerated or effete tissues. Now, it has been observed 
that other foods than proteins have an influence in protecting the 
tissues from destruction, and these must be briefly considered. 

Carbohydrate as a Protector of Protein. — It has long been observed 
that, when there is a deficiency of j^rotein in the food, the metabolism 
of nitrogen will be spared and the tissues protected if the food 
contains plenty of carbohydrate and fat. This subject was fully 
investigated by Lusk. \\'hen the diet contained an abundance of 
protein, fat, and carbohydrate, the organism gained a little nitrogen ; 
when the diet contained the same amount of protein, but no carbo- 
hydrate, the body lost considerable nitrogen. Again, when .the 
food was of the ordinary mixed kind, contained a sufficiency of 
energy, but was of a low protein character, the excretion of nitrogen 
was normal. These results led to the conclu.sion that carbodydrate 
is a protector of protein. 

Pat as a Protector of Protein. — Many investigators have worked 
at this subject. The metabolism of nitrogenous tissue and elimina- 
tion of nitrogen is not prevented by the consumption of fat, but 
the consumption of fat reduces the metabolism of protein so much 
that one-quarter or one-third as much meat will suffice to maintain 
the nitrogen in equilibrium as would have to be consumed if only 
lean meat was used. Wieske concluded that 100 grammes of

PROTEIS SPARERS 6i 

5tai<-a diminish protein katabohsm 19 to 21 per cent., and 100 
grammes of fat 30 to 40 per cent. But when protein and fat only 
are used {meat diet) , a ver\' much larger amount must be consumed 
to maintain the nitrogen in equilibrium than on a mixed diet. 

Fat versos Carbohydrate as Protein Protector. — Kayser and Lan- 
.icrgrL-n ^ '.on?idf-rcd tiiey had proved that fat protects protein 
quite as well as carbohydrates do, both in nitrogen hunger and 
nitrogen abundance. But Landergren noted in some cases that 
fat exhibited only half the protective power of carbohydrate, which 
he explained on the groimd that carbohydrates are essential to the 
body, and when none are suppUed glycogen is formed from tissue 
proteins. Fat caimot ser\e the place of protein for this purpose. 
In other words, as soon as the glycogen of the body is used up, fat 
becomes inferior to carbohydrate as a protector of protein. At- 
water^ found, by observations in the respiration calorimeter, that 
when the total available energ\' remains uniform the protection of 
protein by carbohydrates (largel}' sugar] is shghtly more efficient 
than an isod^Tiamic quantity of fat, but this may depend on a 
" personal equation " or indiWdual peculiarity. 

Gelatin as Protein Sparer. — Gelatin carmot replace protein as a 
food; it contains no piiosphorus. Animals fed on gelatin, carbo- 
hydrate, and fat, die in the same way as those fed on non-nitrog- 
enous diet. Nevertheless, gelatin is more valuable than it has been 
considered to be. The popular notion is that jelly is strengthening. 
Physicians, finding this to be erroneous, jmnped to the conclusion 
jelly was no good at all. Both were wTong. Gelatin is apparently 
all changed into urea, and is a protector of protein, not by lessening 
the amoimt of material oxidized in the same way as carbohydrate 
and fat, but by being directh- substituted for the nitrogenous 
elements of the body. When gelatin is added to the food, the 
nitrogenous equilibrium is maintained with a smaller amount of 
protein than when gelatin is withheld, and even the consumption 
of fat is lessened b\^ gelatin in the food. These facts are intelligible 
if we consider gelatin to be spUt into a urea moiety and a fatt>- 
moiety, Uke proteins. If this supposition is correct, gelatin takes 
the place of stored or circulating protein, but not of tissue proteins, 
and it does not ser\e the ptirpose of tissue formation. The obser\'a- 
tions of Kolpakcha are a valuable contribution to the subject.' 

Peptonized Foods and Metabolism. — The question whether pre- 
peptonized foods can take the place of proteins and prevent the 
destruction of tissue has been investigated. This is of importance 
in invalid dietetics. Peptonized foods contain a considerable 
quantity of proteoses, albimioses, and similar bodies, which can be 
speedily absorbed. What becomes of them ? The peptones are 
broken down into amino-acids and reconstructed into proteins in 
the alimentan,- mucous membrane. If commercial peptone is

injected miu ihc blouJ, it disappears in about three hours by 
digestion and reconstruction in tlie interior of leucocytes. It may 
be assumed, however, that peptonized foods are of value in cases 
of sickness. Deiters made some experiments with a connnercial 
preparation containing 55 per cent, of albumoses and peptones in 
the solid dry matter. His observations were made on women 
>uflering from slight illness. He first established a nitrogenous 
equilibrium on ordinary mixed diet; he then replaced the meat 
and meat extract by the peptone preparation, and found not onl}' 
was tlie nitrogen balance maintained, but that there was a slight 
gain to the body. Munk made a similar investigation, and obtained 
equaih- good results. Politzer^ also arrived at the conclusion that 
peptones are of the same nutritive value as proteins of meat, and 
the albumoses had a somewhat higher value. The slight diarrhoea 
resulting from their use can be moderated by mixing arrowroot or 
cornilour in the Unn\. 

Meat Extracts and Metabolism. — riie nutritive \'alue of any extract 
of meat is comparatively small. One well-known preparation con- 
tains 78 per cent, of solids, including 61 per cent, of xanthin, 
hypoxanthin, creatin, laciic acid, a trace of peptone, some gelatin 
and fat, and 17 per cent, of inorganic salts. Meat extracts have 
a value in promoting the digestion and metabolism of other foods. 
Some people attribute considerable value to the small amount of 
albuminous substances, but it all depends on the proportion of 
proteins. \'oit found 10 grammes of extract of meat — a con- 
siderable dose — contained only 2 grammes of protein; therefore 
the proteins in meat extracts should be disregarded. Meat extracts 
stinmlate appetite by their odour and flavour, provoke a secretion 
of gastric juice, and encourage metabolism in general. Their own 
nitrogen is converted into urea, and therefore, when no meat is 
taken, but a large quantity of meat extract, the urinary nitrogen 
may equal or exceed that produced by ordinary mixed diet. They 
do not afford any energy to the body, but Foster says,- " in some 
way or another they direct metabolism and the distribution of 
energy." 

Water and Metabolism. — The body consists of 630 parts of water 
per 1,000. It is of the greatest importance as a component of the 
tissues, to assist in the exchange of nutritive substances, the dis- 
charge of the products of metabolism, the regulation of tempera- 
ture, and other vital functions. If the supply of water is stopped 
the body will die, and it may die sooner from deprivation of water 
than from starvation. A reduction in the amount of water con- 
sumed accelerates the decomposition of protein and fat to replace 
the water essential for the bodily functions. 

As the result of forty-five rest experiments, Atwater and Benedict 
showed that the average income of water is about 4 pints (2,322 
grammes), and the excretion 4^ pints (2,684 grammes), so that at

OXIDATION ()3 

the lowest estimate | pint of water is formed in the tissues by the 
oxidation of hydrogen in the food and tissues, and during ordinary 
work they found 17 or 18 ounces of water excreted daily in excess 
of that consumed in food and drink. 

The Metabolism of Oxygen and Carbon. — Carbon is essential to 
produce hciii and energ}', and the heat is liberated by oxidation. 
According to Dumas, the amount of carbon excreted by the lungs 
daily is 8-| ounces, but E. Smith found it varies from 7 to 11 ounces, 
according to the work done. The amount of oxygen taken in by 
the lungs and the carbon dioxide excreted have been shown in a 
previous table in the paragraph on the respiratory quotient. We 
do not know exactly how the oxidation of carbon and other sub- 
stances occurs. It may be from the action of nascent oxygen, 
ozone, hydroxyl, and peroxide of hydrogen. Bunge says ozone 
does not occur in the body; but nascent oxygen arises in the body 
tluring various processes of metabolism, and is a very active oxidizer. 
Hydroxyl also arises during such processes, and is a very energetic 
oxidizer. We know, however, that some substances are easily 
oxidized or auto-oxidizable; others are oxidized with difficulty 
— bradyoxidizable or d^-soxidizable. It is believed that in auto- 
oxidation a cleavage of the oxygen molecule occurs; that the auto- 
oxidizable substance seizes one ion and liberates the other. The 
liberated atom is nascent ox3^gen, a very energetic ion, which acts 
upon dys- or brady-oxidizable substances. 

According to Traube, the oxidation does not occur in the manner 
indicated. He considers hydroxyl to be the chief agent. In direct 
oxidation there is a cleavage of water in H and OH ions. The 
OH ion combines with an oxidizable substance; and two OH ions 
unite to form peroxide of hydrogen (H2O0), which oxidizes some 
other body and leaves water. H and OH ions are dangerous 
to cellular organisms, but Traube and Loew believe the cells are 
protected from them by cellular enzymes, or catalases. Many of 
these are oxygen-carriers, called oxidases, and have a specific 
action for certain substances, or what Ehrlich calls nionotropism 
— that is to say, they oxidize particular bodies, and no others. 
The existence of cellular enzymes is now considered a settled 
fact. 

The elements which have greatest affinity for oxygen are carbon 
and hydrogen. These elements predominate in all foods and 
tissues. The carbohydrates contain enough oxygen to satisfy the 
hydrogen contained in the molecule, but there is not enough for 
the carbon also; indeed, two atoms of oxygen are used for every 
atom of carbon, when the food is completely transformed to carbon 
dioxide and water. Fat, on the other hand, contains little oxygen. 
A molecule of stearic acid (CigHggOg) contains only enough oxygen 
to satisfy four atoms of hydrogen. Proteins present the same 
state; 100 grammes of protein contains 7 grammes of hydrogen, 
which requires 56 grammes of oxj'gen to reduce it to water; but 
100 granuues of protein only contains 24 grammes of oxygen, and 



64 METABOLISM 

enough must be taken from the air to reduce both hydrogen and 
carbon in the molecule. The ratio of COg to the oxygen inhaled 
or respiratory quotient therefore varies with the kind of food. 
With ordinary mixed food the €0.2-^02 = 0-87; with starch alone 
the quotient is 10; with proteins it is 0-62; and with fat 0-62, or 
much less than unity. .Muscular work causes the respiratory 
quotient to tend to unity, and it varies from 0-8 to 0-9. 

The Mineral Substances in the human body exist therein partly 
in combination with organic substances, and partly dissolved in 
the body fluids. The condition of the minerals in any substance 
is ascertained by dissolving out the inorganic salts, afterwards 
burning the organic residue, and determining the inorganic sub- 
stance in the ash. The table on p. 65 gives the most important 
bodies. 

When organic bodies are burnt with access of air, the mineral 
substances combined with them are set free. The same process 
occurs when the organized principles of our food become oxidized 
in the tissues of the body. The liberated salts form new combina- 
tions, some probably being organic combinations, but the chief 
form of such salts is the inorganic condition. The inorganic salts 
formed in this manner are (utlur eliminated from the body in the 
urine and other excretions, or they may be retained and recom- 
bined with freshly absorbed organic materials from the alimentary 
canal. The latter view is supported by Torster. If this view is 
correct, it would appear that a constant supply of salts in the food 
is unnecessary, or, at any rate, that the absolutely necessary amount 
of such salts is insignificant. Hammarsten^ remarks that the 
amount of mineral substances really needed by man is very small, 
and that his food usually contains a considerable excess of them; 
and, accordingly, the quantity of mineral substances daily passing 
out of the system in the excretions is no guide as to the actual 
n.ecessity of the organism for them. They are in the food, and 
must be excreted if they are not wanted. This subject, .however, 
is unsettled, and our knowledge of the requirements of the body 
for minerals is in an experimental stage. This much is certain: it 
is impossible for the organism to continue to live when fed on food 
deprived of its mineral constituents. Forster fed dogs and pigeons 
on food rendered as poor as possible in mineral substances, and they 
died earlier than when not fed at all, death being preceded by a 
disturbance of the functions of various organs, particularly the 
nmscles and nerves, from which he concluded that the full-grown 
animal required a considerable ([uantity of inorganic salts. Bunge 
says the necessity for the constant renewal of the inorganic portion 
of our frame is not evident. It might be thought a priori that, 
when the body is once built up, it would last indefinitely. But is 
this a fact ? 

The body consists very largel}' of water. Water is essential for 
the removal of the effete materials arising from metabolism, cell

growth, and disintegration. But excreted water carries away with 
it other materials than those arising from organic decomposition. 
When rain falls from the clouds it consists of pure water; but as it 
percolates through the earth it takes up various inorganic materials, 
not only from the soil, but from the apparently eternal rocks. 
Similarly, in the animal body it dissolves out and carries away 
some of the inorganic materials, not only from the blood, but from 
the nuiscles and other soft tissues, and even from the more solid 
framework. Salts removed in this way must be replaced. But 
they are also necessary for other purposes. Forster found that 
animals fed on proteins freed from salts, with sugar and starch, 
died sooner than when they were starved. How is this ? 

Bunge sa3s proteins contain from 0-5 to 1-5 per cent, of sulphur, 
and during the metabolism of proteins this sulphur is transformed 
into sulphuric acid. Under ordinary circumstances the sulphuric 
acid arising in this manner combines with inorganic salts contained 
in animal or vegetable foods, the acid being therebj^ neutralized 
and removed from the body. If there are no salts or bases at hand 
to neutralize tlie acid arising in this manner, " it attacks those 
wliich form an integral part of the living tissues, and therefore it 
may figuratively be said to wrench individual bricks out of their 
places, and thus induce a destruction of the edifice. ... It may 
be replied that the organism is able to protect itself against the 
injurious action of free acids by splitting oil ammonia from the 
nitrogenous organic compounds. But this power is not unlimited, 
and it is doubtful whether ammonia is invariably present in the 
particular cells where sulphuric acid is liberated and begins its 
work of destruction. "i Lunin supports the view of Bunge. He 
fed animals on nearly ash-free food, but added sodium carbonate 
to neutralize acidit}', and they were kept alive twice as long as 
those fed on the same food, but without sodium carbonate. Com- 
mon salt did not answer the same purpose, nor did sodium car- 
bonate indefinitely prevent death, which is due to the absence of 
proper minerals from the food. Neither will a haphazard mixture 
of mineral substances satisfy the system. Animals fed with normal 
milk will live, but the same animals will die if fed on artificial milk 
containing exactly the normal proportion of casein, fat and sugar, 
and the salts of milk, mixed with it. The reason is not clear. It 
is probable that the salts in normal milk are chemically combined 
with the organic constituents. The ions of inorganic substances 
combine with proteins, and it may be assumed that some, at least, 
of the inorganic constituents of our food are loosely combined with 
organic constituents, and influence their assimilation and utility. 

Among the mineral substances, calcium appears to be essential 
to the life and functions of protoplasm, but it is unknown in what 
way it is combined with the essential basis of life. Potassium is 
another important element, especially of plant life. Without it 
the assimilation of carbon does not go on. Without a due supply

SODIUM AXD POTASSIUM 67 

of calcium and potassium, animal bodies waste. Sodium cliloride 
is essential for the due discharge of the metabolic functions, and 
phosphules appear to be equally necessary. 

Chlorides. — riie amount of sodium chloride in the adult human 
body averages 200 grammes. About 15 to 18 grammes are daily 
e.xcreted in the urine, and smaller quantities in the perspiration 
and fieces. If potassium chloride is substituted for the sodium 
salt in the food, various disturoances arise owing to the deficiency 
of sodium chloride. The latter, therefore, is a most important food. 
The tissues retain common salt most tenaciously, and when there 
is none in the food it gradually disappears from the urine. The 
use which the body makes of it is not clearly understood. The 
exchange is constantly going on, sodium chloride being taken in 
and excreted. It facilitates the absorption of protein foods, and 
increases tissue metabolism. When the supply of common salt is 
insufficient, not only does the elimination of chlorides in the urine 
decrease, but there is a diminution of hydrochloric acid in the 
gastric juice, and consequently a failure of nutrition. There can 
be no doubt that the hydrochloric acid of gastric juice originates 
from the chlorides of the blood. Cahn^ found that, when dogs were 
deprived of salt, their gastric juice contained pepsin, but no HCl. 
Again, if there is a lack of sodium chloride as compared with 
potassium chloride in the food, potassium combinations replace 
sodium combinations in the body, and new combinations of sodium 
and potassium are formed and excreted in the urine. Human 
beings, therefore, who consume a large amount of potatoes and 
other vegetables rich in potassium salts must of necessity take 
common salt, not merely as a condiment, but as an essential part 
of the food. 

Vegetable foods contain three or four times as much potassimii 
as animal foods. This led Bunge to the conclusion that it is the 
abundance of potassium in vegetable foods which causes the neces- 
sity for the consumption of sodium chloride with them. He says:- 
" If a salt of potassium, such as the carbonate, meets with common 
salt or sodium chloride in solution, a partial exchange takes place, 
potassium chloride and sodium carbonate being formed. Sodium 
chloride is the chief inorganic salt of the blood-plasma. When, 
therefore, salts of potassium absorbed with the food reach the blood, 
an exchange takes place, chloride of potassium being formed and 
a sodium salt of the acid. Instead, therefore, of sodium chloride, 
the blood now contains another sodium salt which is not a normal 
constituent of the blood or in its normal proportion. This new 
sodium salt is ejected by the kidneys together with the chloride 
of potassium, and the blood is thereby impoverished of sodium 
and chlorine. This loss can only be made good from without, but 
it explains the craving for salt which affects animals living upon a 
diet rich in potassium. A man hving chiefly on potatoes takes in 
the course of the day 40 grammes of potassium. All the important

vegetable foods are ricli in poUissiuin, which exphiins the fact that 
people who live largely on a vegetable diet use more salt than those 
who eat a good deal of animal food. Bunge gives the following

The use of common salt, therefore, enables mankind to consume 
more freely the vegetable products of the earth. The foregoing 
tables show that the proportion of potassium is highest in wheat, 
barley, rice, potatoes, peas, and beans. These are the staple foods 
of the poorer classes, and therefore salt is an absolute necessity to 
them. On the other hand, a very large number of people consume 
more salt than they require. Salt is not only a food, it is a condi- 
ment, and as such is liable to abuse. If the proportion of sodium 
and potassium in milk is taken as a standard, when the diet con- 
sists of cereals and legumes, about 2 to 4 grammes of salt a day 
would be sufficient to maintain the balance, and when the diet 



rni.oi^'IM. r„ 

consists of rico a few {Icrif^raninus would he cnouf^h and vcrj' 
little is needed with an ordinary mixed diet, whereas most pccjple 
take 20 to jo grammes daily in one way or another. The kidneys 
have to excrete the excess of salt, and it may reasonably be asked: 
Do we not impose too great a task upon them, and is it not attended 
witli danger ? 

When the diet consists of bread and meat without salt, not more 
than 6 or 8 grammes of alkaline salts are excreted in twenty- four 
hours, but with a diet of potatoes atid salt more than lOO grammes 
of alkaline salts pass through the kidneys in a day. When the diet 
consists of rice, only about 2 grammes of alkaline salts are excreted 
a day. In health the kidneys appear to eliminate chlorides with- 
out difticulty. The urine is richest in chlorides after a meal, and 
poorest at night-time. Drinking large quantities of water increases 
the excretion. It is diminished in most febrili' diseases, especially 
in pneumonia, pleurisy, and enteric fever, and increased in diabetes, 
polyuria, and some forms of Bright 's disease, where a large amount 
of water is excreted. In nephritis the kidneys do not excrete salt 
so easily as in health, but this is not constant, the power of ex- 
creting water, salt, and urea, varying from time to time. The 
deficiency is most marked in acute nephritis and chronic parenchy- 
matous nephritis, while in granular kidney the excretion may be 
normal or increased, except during an exacerbation. The failure 
to eliminate salts from the body leads to a retention of chlorides. 
In the retention of chlorides it has been observed that the basic 
ion sodium is retained in many cases, while the potassium ion 
passes out. The retention of the sodium ion leads to the retention 
of water also, the retention of salt in the tissues causing them to 
hold more water by increasing the osmotic attraction. In patho- 
logical conditions the retention of sodium is associated with a^dema 
and ascites; whether as cause or effect is not clear. Bainbridge 
considers it to be the primary condition. Whether it is so or not, 
it is absolutely certain that restriction of the consumption of 
common salt is beneficial in such cases. \\'idal and Javal observed 
a diminution of the oedema in chronic nephritis when salt was 
withdrawn from the food, and an increase of oedema when the 
salt was increased. The oedema diminishes because salt continues 
to pass out of the system and carry water with it; it increases 
when salt is retained, because of its attraction for water. A salt- 
free diet {q.v.) is therefore more beneficial in oedema, ascites, 
anasarca, and serous effusions, than restriction of the consumption 
of water. 

The Alkaline Carbonates and Bases. — The chemical processes of 
the body are dependent on the existence of a certain reaction in 
the fluids, and this reaction, which is habitually alkaline towards 
litmus and neutral towards phenolphthalein, is chiefly due to the 
presence of alkaline carbonates and carbon dioxide. The alkaline 
carbonates are of import ar.cc not only as a solvent for some of the 
proteins and as^^a'constituent of the secretions, but also as a means 



TO METABOLISM 

for the transjKirtation of carbon tlioxidc in the blood. It is tliere- 
fore easy to luulorstand that a decrease in the quantity of alkah 
carbonates below a certain point must endanger life. Such a 
decrease may arise from a lack of bases in the food, which accelerates 
death, as already shown, by the production of acids from the 
destruction of proteins. Potassirm is necessary for the develop- 
ment of cells, especially those of the blood and muscles. Sodium 
is required to make the secretions of a proper composition, and 
sodium carbonate is necessary to carry carbon dioxide from the 
tissues to the lungs. It has been shown that when young animals 
are deprived of potash salts they do not develop muscle. Scurvy 
in adult animals has been attributed to the absence of potassium 
salts, and this idea receives support from the beneficial effects of 
fresh vegetables and fruit upon the course of that disease. 

It may be that potassium is only an acid-carrier in the adult 
organism; at any rate, we know that the organic acids combined 
with it undergo oxidation, and acid salts of potassium become 
transformed into alkaline carbonates, and thereby' render the blood 
and secretions alkaline. Potassium salts occur chiefly in vegetable 
foods, sodium salts in animal foods. Animal foods contain enough 
sodium, but \egetables contain, probably, an excess of potassium, 
and it is a custom to eat salt with them. Bunge says in efl'ect that 
Nature demands the consumption of salt with vegetables because 
of the antagonism wliich exists between potassium and sodium; 
that the great amount of potassium in such foods would lead to 
the excretion of all the sodium from the body if it were not con- 
stantly^ replaced. Forster and other physiologists do not accept 
this statement, but the}' do not give a better explanation for the 
craving for salt, which appears to be stronger in those who con- 
sume chiefl\' a vegetarian diet than in those whose food is largel}^ 
animal diet. Perhaps the true explanation depends on the amount 
and kind of salines in the food. Roberts arranged the following 
foods in the order of their salines: Rice contains 039, wheat-flour 
0-51, meat 0-52, milk o 56, fish 70, green vegetables no, salads i2*o, 
and oysters 230, per cent. Tlie salines of the blood and urine are 
deficient in all cases of gravel, and this deficiency is one of the 
causes of its production. Calculus rarely affects the children of 
well-to-do people, but it is common amongst the poor. The chief 
reason why calculus affects the poor, according to Roberts, is 
because bread, their chief food, is deficient in salines. In potatoes 
the chief salines are salts of potash, and so are those of cabbage 
and other green vegetables and fruit. 

Lime in the Food. — Calcium is one of the most important con- 
stituents of the food. As far back as 1842 Chossat found that 
pigeons were adversely affected when fed with food deficient in 
lime. The birds suffered from diarrhoea, thirst, their feathers 
became ruffled, general health suffered, and they died after eight 
or nine months of such dietary, when it was observed that their 
bones were unusually soft. \u\x, Sceman, and Baginsky, observed 



CAT.cjrrM 



It 



tliat ;iniiii;ils fed with a diet of llesli and distilled water increased 
in weif^Iit and appeared to bo normal for a long time; but eventually 
they became weak, and their bones suffered various changes, owing 
to the gradual disappearance of lime from their tissues and bones. 
Young lions cannot be reared on flesh unless bonemeal is added 
to it. The addition of phosphate of lime to meat diet improved 
the general condition of rats. Calcium therefore is an essential 
substance for tlie formation of the bones and various tissues. In 
the human organism three calcium periods may be recognized: 
(i) The period of groivth, when the organism rcc[uires all the avail- 
able calcium for the growth and formation of the bony skeleton 
and other tissues. (2) The period of reproduction: Calcium is 
required in reproductive processes for the growth of the foetus, the 
formation of milk, and other secretions. (3) The period of old age : 
Calcium is no longer required for the formation of tissues in the 
organism nor for reprocluction. The salts tend to accumulate in 
the tissues, especially in the bloodvessels, causing atheroma, 
atrophy of tissues, and a gradual degeneration of the organism. 

Calcium phosphate forms about 70 per cent, of the total minerals 
in the body. This is because of its great preponderance in the 
bones. Calcium carbonate, sulphate, and fluoride, also occur in 
the bones and teeth, and most tissues contain small quantities of 
calcium carbonate and phosphate. 

During the period of growth a considerable amount of inorganic 
salts is necessary for constructive purposes, and is derived from 
the food. The inorganic constituents in the body of a sucking 
animal correspond very closely with the inorganic constituents in 
the milk of its mother, and the tissues of the sucking animal are 
built up in accordance with the composition of the milk. The 
close correspondence between the inorganic materials in the" milk 
and ash of the young animal's body is the more remarkable inas- 
much as the ash of the blood is completely different from the ash 
of the milk and the bod}^ of the young animal. This is clearly shown 
in the following table :i

organic salts can be obtained in foods other than milk, and whether 
the voiHig animal will continue to obtain the salts necessary for

substances. A comparison of the ash of various substances will

Lime is the chief inorganic material required by the growing 
body. As foods contain sufficient of the other salts, calcium is 
practically the only element we have to consider. Cereals and flesh 
do not contain enough lime, and a young child would not obtain 
sufficient from them to satisfy the demands of the organism for 
bone formation. Leguminous foods contain more lime, but, unfor- 
tunately, they are in other respects unsuitable for an infant's food. 
Milk and yolk of egg contain enough lime, and the latter can be 
combined with the former in various mixtures (see Infant-Feeding). 

Spring water contains lime, and lime-water is a saturated solution 
of lime; but their value is disputable, and our knowledge of the 
action of inorganic lime in the body is unsettled. Bunge says 
inorganic lime is not assimilated. The amount of lime in lime- 
water is not so great as in milk. One pint of cow's milk 
contains i-j grammes CaO, but i pint of lime-water contains only 
1-3 grammes of CaO. In milk the lime is organically combined 
with the casein, and in other foodstuffs, also, it is in organic com- 
bination. It is therefore more rational to give such foods than 
lime-water. It has been conclusively proved that a deficiency of 
lime in the food leads to defective formation of bone and the pro- 
duction of rickets. When young animals are fed with artificial 
food deficient in lime salts, the bones become abnormally pliable 

1 " Physiol, and Pathol. Chem.," p. 84. 



CAT.CTUM 71 

and hritdi'; indeed, tlic eharacteristie features of true rirkets are 
produced. But our knowledge of the pathology of rickets is still 
incomplete. Some children become rickety whose food constantly 
contains enough lime, whence it may be concluded that deficiency 
of calcium is not the sole cause of rickets, but that there is a defec- 
tive calcium metabolism, an inadequate absorption of the ingested 
lime, combined with abnormal processes in the bone-forming 
elements. It is estimated that a child requires \ gramme of cal- 
cium daily, and it is probable that to insure absorption it must be 
organically imitcd to the proteins of the food; for, in spite of the 
addition of lime-water to diluted cow's milk, rickets may continue 
to prevail. Cow's milk is richer in lime and other inorganic salts 
than human milk. The greater rapidity of growth in the calf as 
compared with the human infant is correlated with this fact. The 
absence of a sufficient quantity of fat in the food, and also an 
excessive quantity of fat, tends to deprive the growing body of its 
normal supply of calcium and magnesium. 

Calcium in Adult Life. — Calcium is the most abundant metal in 
the bod}'. Its phosphate is the chief constituent of bone; its 
protein combinations are essential to the nucleated cells which are 
most active in nutrition; and its soluble salts have an influence 
upon the activity of the muscles and the properties of the body 
fluids. According to Bunge, inorganic salts of lime are useless to 
the body, but Lusk found that both organic and inorganic lime 
were absorbed. Forster found that 60 per cent, of the lime in food 
is absorbed, and that the greater portion of the metabolized lime 
is eliminated by the cells of the intestinal mucous membrane. The 
calcium requirement of the adult body appears to be about 0'75 
gramme of CaO per day. According to Wendt and Renvall, the 
intestinal mucous membrane eliminates from 60 to 90 per cent., 
and the kidneys from 10 to 40 per cent. Adults do not require so 
much calcium in proportion to their w'eight as growing children, 
especially as their bones have ceased to grow^ It is very probable 
that the ordinary diet of adult life contains enough and to spare. 
But recent investigations show that it is not safe to assume that a 
diet containing sufficient protein and energy necessarily furnishes 
enough lime. This is a point which can only be settled by metab- 
olism experiments in which a balance is made between the intake 
and the output. The most recent investigation is that made by 
Sherman, Mettler, and Sinclair. ^ It is impossible to give an accoimt 
of this work in a short space, but the table by them on p. 74 
shows the average amount of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and 
iron, consumed daily on various dietaries. 

The investigators make the following observations: Dietaries rich 
in protein have a fairly high proportion of phosphoric acid, but the 
parallel is not so close in the case of protein and iron, and there 
are greater discrepancies with calcium and magnesium. It can, 
therefore, no longer be said that the amount of protein in the

(liotary is a svifticicnl measure of its riilmess in building niatcriil. 
Apart from the proportion of nitrogen, especial attention should 
be given to the amount of calcium, phosphorus, and iron, in tl.e 
footl. Metabolism experiments show that a healthy man requires 
0*75 gramme of calcium per day, but many of the dietaries in the 
above table contain less than that amount. Gautier and Albu 
assert tliat the food should contain at least i-oto 1-5 grammes CaO 
per diem. If this is true, the majority of the above diets are defec- 
tive in this respect, and would be improved by including a greater 
quantity of milk, cheese, junket, koumiss, buttermilk, etc., or peas 
and beans, in the dietary. 

Adults, however, do not require so much calcium in proportion 
to their weight as infants. The ordinary foods probably contain 
enough for most persons who have attained middle age. In some 
diseases the metabolism of calcium is defective — e.g., senile osteo- 
porosis, formation of osteophytes, ossification of muscles, etc. In 
the latter calcium is retained in too great a proportion; in the 
former it appears that calcium is not absorbed in sufficient amount. 
Von Limbeck i investigated two cases of senile osteoporosis. The 
subjects were old women, in whom the metabolism of calcium 
oxide was defective, or the food did not contain enough to supply 
the needs of the organism. At any rate, the subjects lost con- 
siderable calcium oxide each day. It was excreted almost entirely 
by the intestinal mucous membrane, and the investigator remarked 
that such a loss could not continue very long without producing a 
fatal result.

2. Woman, aged 81: In food, CaO, •6;' in urine, -03; in faeces, i'4:

, Among the diseases of late middle life and old age, calcareous 
degenerations rank as a serious trouble. What leads to the deposi- 
tion of calcium in these cases is not clearly known. It may be that 
a similar defective metabolism to that which leads to rickets is also 
the cause of the accumulation of lime in unwonted situations, espe- 
cialh^ the intima of the bloodvessels, at this late period of life. 
Other ailments ascribed to an excess of lime in the food are calculus 
and constipation. Calcium lessens the muscular activity of the 
alimentary canal. One of the chief sources of lime is the hard 
xvater which we drink. Unboiled water contains more lime than 
boiled water. But milk contains more calcium than hard water 
does. Eggs come next to milk in the proportion of lime. A still 
smaller, but important, quantity also occurs in the cereals — especially 
rice — spinach, asparagus, and radishes. According to Rumpf,- 
bread, meat, fish, potatoes, apples and other fruit, are poor in 
calcium, and should form the chief food of atheromatous subjects.

Oxalate of Lime. — Calcium occurs in .'iome foods in combination 
with oxalic acid. The consumption of foods containing this salt of 
lime is said to lead to the formation of oxalate of lime calculus, or 
gravel. Whether the formation of this stone is due to an excess 
of the lime salt in the food or to retention owing to some defect of 
metabolism is not clearly known. Nephritic attacks have been 
known to occur after the consumption of rhubarb, especially when 
hard water was drunk. The amount of oxalic acid excreted daily 
by men is q-i gramme, according to Schultzen.i It never occurs 
in a free state in the urine, but always as calcium oxalate, which 
imder ordinary circumstances is kept in solution by acid phos])hate 
of sodium. WluMi present in excess in the urine, it is precipitated 
in crystals, and gives rise to symptoms of oxaluria: dyspepsia, 
nervous exhaustion, mental distress, or spemiatorrhoea ; and may 
be due to excess of saccharine foods, alcoholic liquors, mental trouble 
t)r overwork, and is aggravated b\^ the consumption of foods con- 
taining a large percentage of oxalate of lime. According to Esbach, 
the amount of oxalic acid in foods is as follows:

The foods which contain most oxalic acid sliould certainly be 
prohibited in cases of oxaluria, oxalate of lime gravel, and in other 
conditions when calcium oxalate crystals occur in the urine. 
These include tea, coffee, cocoa, spinach, rhubarb, sor^-el, pepper, 
beetroot, and beans. Only a small quantity of raspberries, goose- 
berries, plums, currants, prunes, grapes, and figs, should be allowed. 
The excretion of oxalic acid or oxalate of lime will be encouraged 
by a dietary which is deficient in these elements — viz., animal 
foods, bread, potatoes, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower,

carrots, lettuce, endive, strawberries, cherries, oranges. Tomatoes 
are stated above to contain o'oo2 to 0-052 per cent, of uxalic acid, 
but, accordiuf,' to more recent authorities, the chief organic acid in 
tomatoes is citric acid. 

Magnesium is of considerably less importance than calcium to 
the body. The total amount is estimated to be only one-twentieth 
the amount of lime. Very little is absorbed from the food, about 
one-third being excreted in the urine and two-thirds in the fa.'ces. 
Magnesium salts are more soluble in the fluids of the body than 
calcium salts. Whereas 99-5 per cent, of the total lime in the body 
is deposited in the bones, only 71 per cent, of magnesium is in the 
bones. The muscles contain more magnesia than lime, but the 
blood contains more lime than magnesia. It is absorbed from the 
intestinal canal both in the organic and the inorganic condition. 
When animals are fed on a diet containing little calcium, but an 
abundance of magnesium, the bones may be brought to contain 
double the normal quantity of magnesium; but the skeletal develop- 
ment lags, whence it is considered proved that magnesium cannot 
be a substitute for calcium. The magnesium salts, being more 
soluble, are excreted in greater proportion than calcium by the 
kidnej^s; in fact, the greater part of the absorbed magnesium leaves 
the body in the urine, while the unabsorbed magnesium salts form 
insoluble soaps, and are excreted in faeces. Magnesium phosphate 
occurs in the tissues along with calcium phosphates, and appears 
in the urine in the form of triple phosphate (ammonio-magnesium 
phosphate). Foods in general contain about the same amount of 
magnesium as of calcium, but meats in general contain o'oyb gramme 
CaO and 0*19 gramme MgO per 100 grammes of protein; fish con- 
tains o-i8 gramme CaO and 0-23 gramme MgO per 100 grammes 
protein; milk and its products contain more lime than magnesia, 
while in bread they are nearly equal. 

Phosphorus is essential for all cells. Wherever new cells are 
formed, this element is necessary as a building material. It is, 
therefore, a most important constituent of the food of growing 
children, and any deficiency must be followed by impaimient of 
the growth. It is especially needed for the neurons or cells of the 
central ner\'ous system and for the bones. But there is a difterence 
in the condition of the phosphorus in these tissues. The phos- 
phorus of bones and other hard tissues exists in the form of earthy 
phosphates and alkaline earths, which enter the system as the 
inorganic phosphates of the food. The phosphorus in the important 
or more vital cellular elements is organized, and consists of nuclein 
and various phosphorized fats or lipoids, such as lecithin, cerebrin, 
and cholesterin. 

Rohmann inquired i^ What influence have the inorganic phos- 
phates on the construction of phosj^horized proteins in the body ? 
He fed animals with earthy phosphates and diets consisting of 
(i) phosphorized proteins (casein and vitellin), (2) non-phosphorized

protein (oilostin). With the loriiior diet there was a retention of 
nitrogen and phosphorus in the body; with the latter none occurred. 
He concluded from these observations that the body does not 
appear to have the power of building up the phosphorized proteins 
of the cells from non-phosphorized proteins and inorganic phos- 
phates. On the other hand, the plios])hori/.ed proteins ajipear to 
lie built up from lecithin and non-phosphorized protein. It is 
therefore to the phosphorized organic constituents of the food we 
must look for our supply of phosphorus — viz., nucleo-proteins, 
phospho-proteins, nuclein, lecithin, cholesterin, phospho-carnic 
acid, and glycero-phosphoric acid, found in the cellular elements, 
particularly in egg-yolk, sweetbread, lish-roe, the germ of cereals 
and legumes, and in casein. The amount of phosphoric acid in 
various foods was stated bv Girard^ to be as follows:

Bunge^ found the amount of P2O5 in^ioo grammes of dried sub- 
stance was as follows: Yolk of egg i"90, cow's milk i"86, beef i"83, 
peas 0'99, wheat 0-94, potato 0'64, white of egg 0-20, gramme. 
Voit estimated that a human body weighing 70 kilos (154 pounds) 
would contain — in the bones 1,400 grammes phosphorus, in 
the muscles 130 grammes, in the nervous system 12 grammes. 
An attempt to find the phosphorus requirement of the body is 
fraught with difftculties analogous to those surrounding the protein 
requirement. The data available for establishing a phosphorus 
standard are fewer than those existing on the subject of nitrogen. 
But experiments show that the requirement of phosphorus varies 
between 0'9 and i"5 grammes per diem, the difference being due in 
part to the condition of the phosphorus in the diet. The experi- 
ments of Sherman and Sinclair are valuable, and their report states 
that at present it can only be said that the data now available 
indicate that a healthy man, by accustoming himself to a low 
phosphorus intake, or by the selection of food containing phos- 
phorus almost entirely in organic combination, may maintain 
equilibrium on a diet furnishing about 0*9 gramme of phosphorus 
or 2 grammes P2O5; but that maintenance of equilibrium at the 
normal level of a full diet, so as to insure the carrying of a full

normal store of phosphorus compounds in the body, appears to call 
for the intake of about 1-5 granmies of phosphorus or 3*5 grammes 
of Po^o daily. ^ But further experiments are necessary, regard 
being had to the sources of the phosphorus, which may be grouped 
as follows: (i) Inorganic phosphates; (2) simple organic combina- 
tions of phosphoric acid or phosphates— f.^., phytin or plant- 
vitellin and pinto-albumose; (3) phosphorized fats — e.g., lecithin, 
cholesterin. cerebrin; (4) phosphorized proteins — e.g., nucleo- 
proteins, phospho - proteins. Kolpakcha undertook experiments 
to discover the influence of food upon protein metabolism, and 
found that the amount of phosphorus excreted in the urine and 
fieces was directly proportional to the phosphorus content of the 
food. These experiments have been referred to previously (p. 60). 
The amount of phosphoric acid in the food and the excretions, 
together with the gain or loss to the body, was as follows:

The phosphorus of the tissues is chiefly in the nucleins and nucleo- 
proteins of the cells, which are the most active in metabolism ; 
whereas the inorganic materials of the bones is commonly assumed 
to be inactive. There has therefore been a general tendency to 
assume that the output of phosphorus may be regarded as a measure 
of the nucleo-protein metabolism, just as the output of nitrogen 
is considered a measure of protein metabolism in general. Thus, 
an intimate connection between ihe phosphorus eliminated and 
the katabolism of nucleins is assumed by Dunlop, Paton, and their

collaborators,^ when interpreting the results obtained in' an in- 
\'estigation of the elfects of muscular exertion. The investigation 
was made upon persons who rode a bicycle daily as long as possible 
without serious discomfort, and who were taking a diet of known 
composition and amount during a period of seven days. In each 
case the exertion caused an increased elimination of nitrogen and 
sulphur, but only when the subject was in poor training was there 
a corresponding increase in the elimination of phosphates and uric 
acid. They therefore concluded that when the subject was in 
good training the muscular exertion only caused the breaking down 
of simple proteins; when the subject was in poor training there 
w'as a breaking down, not only of the simple j)roteins, but of the 
nucleo-proteins also. On the other hand, it was shown by Voit 
that the material katabolized during fasting conies largely from 
the bones; while Jordan and Patten,- after making extended 
observations on animals, concluded that the phosphorus metabolism 
consists largeh' in the formation of inorganic phosphates from 
comparatively simple organic compounds such as phytin. There- 
fore, whether the amount of phosphorus eliminated can or cannot 
be taken as a measure of the metabolism of nucleo-protein, it is 
certain that the output of phosphorus and the output of nitrogen 
do not run on parallel lines, and cannot be taken as a measure of 
the same set of changes. 

It is essential for the growth of new tissues that phosphorus 
should be stored in the body as w'ell as nitrogen, \\henever there 
is a storage of nitrogen, a corresponding storage of phosphorus 
occurs. The importance of phosphorus as a building material 
was shown by Bunge when he discovered that the proportion of 
phosphorus, calcium, and protein, in the milk of animals is directly 
proportionate to the rapidity of growth.

Iron is essential to the human body. It is taken into the body 
in the food, excreted by the liver, and leaves the body in the 
faeces. Owing to the fact of iron entering and leaving the body 
by the alimentary tract, it appears impossible to determine the 
amount required daily. Stockman, however, estimates that the 

' Jouiiial 0/ Physinlogy, 1897-98, p. 68.

//.V).V Rl 

typical food III all adult coiilaius lo luilligramiiKS of iron daily, 
and tiiat it is sufficient for tjie needs of the bod\'. The blood of 
an adult contains j grammes of iron; the liver, spleen, skin, and 
hair, contain smaller amounts; it is excreted from the body in the 
bile and the faeces. The lucmoglobin of the blood contains 004 per 
cent, of iron. The spleen contains a large proportion of iron. 
According to Hasse, the spleen pulp of old horses contains 5 per 
cent. Oidlmann found that the ash of the spleen contains from 
7 to 16 per cent, of iron. The iron existing in the blood is in the 
form of hemoglobin. That in the spleen is likewise haemoglobin. 
The splenic cells are believed to have the function of liberating 
haemoglobin from effete blood-cells; the lux-moglobin passes from 
the spleen to the liver, where it undergoes various changes. The 
amount of iron in liver which has been washed free from blood 
varies within very wide limits. Bemmclin gives it as averaging 
o-i per cent. ; Hunter gives it as only 0-087 per cent. It is reduced 
in leuk.nemia to o-oi per cent., but increased in pernicious anaemia, 
because the normal destruction of haemoglobin by the liver is then 
much exaggerated. Iron exists in the cells of the liver as a com- 
pound or compounds of iron with nuclein and protein; two of 
these compounds have been named hepatin and ferratin ; and the 
iron is either the ferric or ferrous oxide. The proportion of iron 
in the liver of the new-born animal is greater than that in the 
adult. Bunge believes that the liver acts as a storehouse of iron 
subsequently used in the form of red blood-corpuscles. Delepine 
agrees with this, but goes farther; he considers the liver is not only 
a storehouse of the nucleo-protein compounds containing iron, but 
that the liver cells elaborate these compounds into new haemoglobin 
for young red blood-corpuscles. This is described by him as the 
ferrogenic function of the liver, which persists throughout life. The 
liver also excretes iron. The bile pigment is derived from haemoglobin, 
and is free from iron. This pigment is split off from the haemoglobin, 
the iron-bearing nucleo-proteins being stored in the cells of the 
liver; but some of the iron is excreted in the bile in the form of 
a phosphate which forms from o 004 to o-oio percent, of that fluid. 
The iron of the body is derived from the foods; but it is probably 
not derived from the oxide and other inorganic salts of iron. Con- 
siderable doubt has arisen as to whether inorganic iron, given as a 
drug for the cure of anaemia and chlorosis, is absorbed. Von 
Noorden, Stockman, and others, assert that inorganic iron is 
absorbed, and is very efficient in the treatment of anaemia and 
chlorosis. Hamburger and Morner consider that little or none of 
the inorganic preparations of iron is absorbed from the alimentary 
canal. The total amount of iron in the blood is only 3 grammes, 
but many times that amount is taken during a course of treatment 
for anaemia. Bunge explains the usefulness of iron in the treat- 
ment of anaemia and chlorosis in the following way: Chlorosis is 
attended by considerable fermentation in the alimentary canal, 
wherebv much sulphuretted hydrogen is evolved; and this gas, 

6 



8. METABOLISM 

he says, destroys the organic loiniiounds of iron in tlie food, wliich 
are normally ntili/.ed to manufacture luenioglobin. If, however, 
an excess of inorganic iron is likewise present, some or most of the 
sulphuretted iiydrogen evolved will combine with such iron to 
form a sulpliide. and in that manner it protects the organic iron 
combinations from destruction by HjS. 

If the blood is deficient in iron, it would scarcely be possible to 
make good that deficiency bj' inorganic salts in the food. Very 
few foods contain much inorganic iron, although Stockman and 
Von Xoorden have expressed the belief that the inorganic iron 
contained in the food is absorbed and utilized in the production 
of haemoglobin. Moreover, if the food is deficient in iron, it would 
a priori lead to anaemia; and this idea receives support from various 
observations — e.g., the blood of dogs fed with bread contained less 
iron than the blood of the same animals fed with meat. If 
young animals receive only the same proportion of iron per kilo 
of body-weight as is necessary for adults, they become anaemic. 
When fed with food devoid of iron, animals lose 40 per cent, of 
their iron in three weeks; when fed with food containing it, iron 
is absorbed from the duodenum and jejunum. 

The chief source of iron in the blood and tissues is undoubtedly 
the organic combinations, such as the hcernatogens, or compounds of 
iron and nucleo-protein or nuclein, in the cells of animals and 
vegetables. It is not known exactly what proportion the organic 
bears to the inorganic iron in our foods; but it is undoubtedly 
highest in blood, liver, spleen, muscle, and yolk of egg; it is also high 
in oatmeal, lentils, spinach, and apples. Bunge puts foods in the 
following order, spina' ;h containing most and wheat least iron: 
Spinach, yolk of egg, beef, apples, lentils, strawberries, white 
beans, peas, potatoes, wheat. Boussingault ^ gives the following 
table:

CHAPTER IV 

THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

The amount of food required to keep any person in a state of 
health and bodily eciuilibrium varies according to many circum- 
stances, such, for instance, as the condition of rest or work, the 
kind of work, the training, the age, sex, size and weight of the body, 
restlessness or placidity, and even the individual peculiarities. 
Viewing the body as an engine, it has been shown, as far as it is 
possible to be proved, that the laws of conservation of matter and 
energy are followed in the organism as without. The body loses 
matter and energy; the matter and energy are not destroyed in the 
body, but undergo transformation. It may therefore be assumed 
that, whatever material is used in the body, and however much 
energy is exhibited or heat evolved by it, both matter and energy 
have been derived from the food consumed or stored up in the tissues. 

Before entering upon a consideration of the theoretical require- 
ments of individuals, some standard dietaries and a few examples 
of the diets consumed by people of different classes, such as those 
given in the table on p. 84, will be interesting. 

This table shows how the diets of people who have an un- 
restricted choice of foods differ from one another, as well as the 
dietaries of armies and navies, and even the so-called " standard 
diets." The principles which should guide us in arranging a dietary 
for individuals or groups of people under various circumstances are 
as follows: 

I . The Food required is Proportional to the Extent of the Surface 
of the Body. -Tlie heat of tlic bodx' is generaird by the oxidation 
of food or tissue-substance. A small animal gives off, weight for 
weight, more heat than a large one. In experiments upon dogs 
weighing from 225 to 28 kilos, the excretion of COg per hour was 
practically the same for each square centimetre of surface. Now, 
a large animal has a smaller cutaneous surface in proportion to its

area than a large one. Small persons lia\e a relatively larger 
cutaneous area than big people, in proportion to their size and 
weight, and thin, aPigular people than persons of a rounded con- 
tour. Therefore a small or a thin and angular person loses more 
heat per kilo of body-weight than a larger and more rounded person ; 
a thin, premature infant more than a plump and well-de\'eloped 
child. After a consideration of many experiments on animals and

Hence, the amount of heat lost by the body is an important 
factor in the regulation of the food, and this is governed to a great 



fxlL'iit by area of the surface. Heubner quotes the case of a 
premature child which did not thrive when its food yielded no to 
125 calories per kilo of body-weifiht, and failed to do so until it was 
fed with 3^ ounces of cow's milk per j)ound of weight, yielding 
150 calories per kilo. The converse holds good: stout persons often 
have a smaller appetite for food than thin ones, and they need less 
because they have a relatively smaller surface area, and the amount 
of heat radiated from tlieir surface is less than in a thin person 
of the same weight. 

2. The Food must be Proportional to the Weight oJ the Body.— 
The amount required varies, other things being equal, with the 
weight of the body. The heat of the body is produced by the 
o.xidation of food consumed or stored in the tissues. If the tissues 
of the body are not to be used for the production of heat and energy, 
there must be a minimum of food consumed to supply the energy 
utilized by, and the heat radiated from, the body. The heat given 
off varies with the state of rest or work. In a state of rest a man of 
154 pounds (70 kilos) gives off 15 cubic feet of CO, in twenty-four 
hours. The production of i cubic foot of COgby combustion 
involves an expenditure of heat equivalent to 160 foot-tons of 
energy. Therefore 15 x 160 = 2,400 foot-tons of energy are devoted 
to tlie maintenance of the temperature of the body and the per- 
formance of the bodily functions during a state of rest. Now, 
I calorie is equal to 1-54 foot-tons of energy, and therefore 2,400 foot- 
tons is equal to about 1,560 calories, or 22-3 calories per kilo of 
body- weight. Play fair and Parkes, whose work is still of great 
value, found that this amount of heat and energy would be jaelded 
by 2-5 ounces of dry albumin, i ounce of fat, and 12 ounces of 
carbohydrate, which was therefore established as the minimum 
food requirement, or " diet for sustenance." According to later 
investigations, the amount of food required to supply the heat 
i-'xpended per kilo of body-weight by the adult, under various cir- 
cumstances, is as follows:

3. The Amount of Food required is Proportional to the Rate of 
Growth. — The younger the animal organism, the more rapid is the 
r.ite of growth. According to Heubner, the child's body grows 
seven times more rapidly from one to three months than from 
six to nine months of age. A child commonly loses a little weight 
for a few days after birth; but the average increase of weight up to 
tlirce months is 3-6 pounds; from three to six months, 3-6 pounds; 



86 THE AM0U.\7' OF FOOD REQUlRFD 

from six to nine months, 3-4 pounds; and from nine to twelve 
montlis, j pounds. After the first year the average increase in 
height and weight is sliown in the table on p. 87. 

Children do not increase in weight unless the food supplied to 
them is more than enough to yield the heat radiated from their 
cutaneous surface. Moreover, an excess of food may not yield 
an increase in height and weight proportionate to the consumed 
food. Only a small portion of the food consumed may be retained 
by the body, there being a limit to the amount of flesh laid on daily. 
Nevertheless, this general increase in weight and constant growth 
in height should be anticipated by a provision of food more than 
enough to suppl}- the heat given off. When food is unrestricted 
and the appetite is of the healthy juvenile character, there need 
be little fear on this score; but delicate children have a feeble 
appetite, and children in public institutions have not a free choice 
or unlimited supply of food. In arranging dietaries for the latter, 
it is es})ecialh' necessary to be liberal. 

Anthropometric tables show that — {a) Growth is most rapid 
during the first period of five years after birth, the weight being 
trebled in the first 3'ear, and nearh^ doubled in the second year. 
The rate of growth in this period is nearly the same in both sexes, 
but girls are a little shorter and lighter than bo3-s. {b) In the 
second period, five to ten years, boys grow more rapidly than girls, 
their weight averaging 2 or 3 pounds more, (c) In the third 
period, ten to fifteen j'ears, girls grow more rapidly than boys; 
from twelve and a half to fourteen and a half j^ears they are taller 
than boys of the same age, and from twelve and a half to fifteen 
and a half years they are 3 or 4 pounds heavier than boys of the 
the same age. (d) In the period from fifteen to twenty years, boys 
again grow more rapidly than girls; their weight increases at the 
rate of 6-9 pounds per year, that of girls only 275 pounds per year. 
(e) Boys complete their growth in height at twenty-three years 
of age, but continue to increase in breadth and weight, (iirls 
reach their full height and weight at about twenty years, and their 
weight is practically stationary for the next five or even ten years. 
(/) After thirty-five years of age, adults increase in weight at the 
rate of | pound (0-34 kilo) per annum, which is not always desirable 
or advantageous. Up to the height of 67 inches, men are usually 
heavier than women of the same age; but women of a greater 
height than 67 inches are as a rule heavier than men of a corre- 
sponding height and age, and after middle life their weight may 
increase \ery considerabh'. 

4- The Food should be Proportional to the Age.— The feeding of 
infants and children will be dealt with in a separate chapter. 
Children digest quickly, and their respiratory activity is very great, 
even when at rest ; for this reason they should be allowed as much 
carboh\-drate as an adult, besides an ample supplv of protein for 
tissue formation. The protein, it is shown in that chapter, must 
be somewhat more for each kilo than is required by an adult.

88 THE AMOUNT OF FOOD RFOUIRi:n 

It is usually considered advisable to allow children under one year 
of age about 2 grammes of protein per kilo, whereas onl^' 1-7 grammes 
is requisite for an adult, according to Voit's standard. In the 
discussion which has waged around the subject of protein, nobody, 
so far as I am aware, has attempted to show that 2 grammes of 
protein per kilo is too much for a yoimg child. The amount needed 
for growth diminishes gradually, and reaches \'oit's standard at 
the adult period. About half the protein should be derived from 
animal sources; but where the cost of meat, fowl, fish, eggs, milk, 
and cheese, is prohibitive, growing children should be given an 
equivalent amount of peas, beans, or lentils, allowing for the lower 
coefficient of digestibility of the legumes. Carbohydrates are very 
necessary, together with fat, in forming the young tissues, to 
supplj- the carbon oxidized during their great metabolic activity, 
and the heat radiated from their comparatively large cutaneous 
area. For these reasons, the supply of bread, butter or other fat, 
jam, marmalade, treacle, or honey, should be practically unlimited. 
(See Feeding of Infants and Children.) 

\\'ith regard to 3'Oung adults, the skeleton or framework may 
cease to grow at twenty to twenty-three years of age; but certain 
organs do not reach their full development before twenty-five years, 
and the body does not attain its nornial breadth and circumference 
earlier. It is prudent, therefore, always to consider the young 
adult as having not completed his physical development until this 
age is attained, and consequently to feed him abundantly in order 
to encourage the formation of blood, bone, and muscle. Young 
females attain complete development a little earlier than males, 
but they should not be encouraged to eat less on that account than 
a person of a\'erage size and weight. The amount of food required 
is not quite the same after growth and development are completed; 
an excess of food over the physical requirements then tends to the 
accumulation of fat in the subcutaneous and other tissues. It 
should, however, be distinctly understood that throughout the 
active period of life the healthy adult requires a definite amount of 
l^rotcin and energy to supply heat and force, to replace tissues 
worn out, and to keep the organs in good repair and the whole 
body in sound health. 

\ ariety of food is necessary, for monotony even of the very best 
kinds leads to satiety, loss of appetite, loathing of food, and subse- 
quent ill-health. Vegetables and fruit are absolutely necessary to 
the dwellers in towns; but raw fruit and vegetables are not so 
easily digested as the same kinds are when cooked. Salads (lettuce, 
watercress, green onions, tomatoes, celery, etc.) are so valuable 
for the juices contained in them that they cannot be too strongly 
recommended to those who can digest them. Similar juices are 
contained in cabbage, cauliflower, spinach, etc., but these are lost 
in a very great measure by cooking them. Oranges, lemons, 
bananas, grapes, and strawberries, contain equally valuable juices, 
and may be eaten raw with advantage to the consumer; but apples. 



locals, plums, gooseberries, and many other fruits, are better 
cooked before being eaten. 

A deficiency of food is to be carefully guarded against. Protein, 
being the most costly food, is the principle most likely to become 
deficient in the diet. A considerable discussion has arisen upon the 
amount of protein required daily by the adult after the period of 
growth is completed, and the matter is more fully considered below. 
V'oit's standard of an allowance of 1-4 to 17 grammes of protein 
and 40 calories per kilo of bod\^-weight has long been accepted as 
fairly accurate. But the allowance of protein by Voit and others 
has been seriously impugned, as we shall see later. Until we have 
a greater experience of the low-protein diet, we should, however, 
be careful in our judgment. For generations it has been considered 
that protein starvation is the cause of much ill-health and misery, 
and this position cannot hghtly be given up by the physician. 
Protein starvation is not unconmion amongst many poor but 
respectable peoj)le who for a long time have to live upon a diet in 
which " tea and bread and butter " figure prominent^, with an 
occasional bloater or other appetizer. Such a diet, although it may 
yield enough heat to supply the demands of the body according to 
scientific requirements, does not give the consumer strength and 
endurance. The general principles laid down, therefore, should 
guide us; and where the cost of meat, fowl, fish, eggs, or milk, is 
prohibitive, the freer use of peas, beans, lentils, and nuts, is strongly 
recommended. In spite of scientific investigations as to the bodily 
requirement of persons in adult life, and standards for the amoimt 
which the}^ should consume, we are bound to admit there may also 
be a personal equation which will upset the calculation, and that 
scientific figures can only be given for averages, unless a similar 
investigation is made upon each individual. 

Overfeeding must also be guarded against. In youth and early 
adult life an excess of food may be disposed of by quick digestion 
and speedy assimilation, great metabolic activity, and greater 
ph\'sical exercise, whereby the excess consumed is used up and 
eliminated. But when middle life is attained the body is less 
active; the active interest in cricket, football, golf, and other out- 
of-door games, is dropped, consequently less food is metabolized, 
and an " undesirable balance " remains against the consumer. A 
certain amount of the surplus may be stored up in the body as 
protein, glycogen, and fat, and by-and-by the individual becomes 
obese or corpulent. There are some persons, even though they 
continue to eat large meals, lead an inactive life, follow a sedentary 
occupation, and live in warm rooms, " lapped in luxur}'," who 
never put on flesh; they seem to have no power of forming fat 
in their body or of accumulating it ; but the " undesirable balance " 
causes other troubles, such as bilious attacks, migraine, headache, 
lethargy, diseases of the liver, kidneys, bloodvessels, and favours 
the production of rheumatism, gout, gravel, and kindred affections. 
In a third class of persons a combination of the two groups of 



90 THE AMOUXT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

trouble occurs. Therefore an excess of food in adult life encourages 
or causes the diseases to which people are liable in middle and 
advanced age. Again, the personal equation should be taken into 
account; it is probable that the individual requires a smaller 
(juantity of food than that prescribed by standard dietaries; or it 
may be that one of the principles should be reduced in amount. 
Thus, the protein may need to be lowered to two-thirds of the 
standard, and the fat to about half the amount, thereby reducing 
the total calorie value. In other cases only the carbohydrate 
needs to be lowered. 

The power of the entire muscular system declines after forty 
years of age; from this period, not only the skeletal muscles, but 
the involuntary muscles of the heart and other organs, gradually 
diminish in vigour. In every part of the organism there is a dis- 
position to lay on fat rather than to form new materials charac- 
teristic of the organs; and in every organ there is a tendency to 
replace the normal matrix by a deposition of amorphous tissue, 
which may undergo calcareous degeneration. These two charac- 
teristics of increasing age, calcareous and fatty degeneration, are 
indicative of a decline in the nutritive processes. The metabolism 
e^•erv^vhere becomes feebler and slower; sensory impulses pass 
with increasing slowness to and from the brain; the sensations are 
blunted, the molecular energy of the mipulses diminished, and 
ever^'where there are indications of the diminished ability to metab- 
olize the amount of food given in the standard diets for adults. 
This matter is more fully considered in the chapter on Food for 
the Aged. 

5. The Influence of Sex on the Amount of Food required. — The 
general rule that the food should vary with the size and weight of 
the individual holds good when considering the food of persons of 
different sexes. But the influence of size is far less than that of the 
inborn individual characteristics of the organism giving rise to the 
personal equation of metabolism. The smaller metabolism of a 
woman, leading to the consumption of a smaller amount of food 
compared with that of the average man, should be regarded in the 
light of the personal equation involved in the sex of the individual 
rather than with reference to the smaller average weight and size 
of a woman. This is illustrated by the food of an active man and 
woman of about the same age and weight, whose nutritive and 
nitrogenous equilibrium was maintained upon the following daily 
amounts: 

Man: Protein 100, fat 70, carbohydrate 400, grammes; calories 2,700. 
Woman: Protein 60, fat 67, carbohydrate 340, grammes; calories 2,263. 

With the exception of the differences in metabohc activity, 
there appears to be no reason for any variation in the food owing 
to the sex of the consumer; and Atwater established the principle 
that the allowance for a healthy woman should be o-8 of that for a 
man. It may, however, l)e stated as a general rule tiiat a woman 



THE FOOD OF WOMEN gX 

requires about the same amount of protein and energy per kilo 
of body-weight as a man under the same circumstances. The 
iimonnt of energy required to produce a definite quantity of work 
is no less when the work is performed by a woman than when it is 
(lone by a man; therefore the supply of fuel should not be less. 
On the other hand, it frequently happens that the expenditure 
of energy to produce a definite amount of work by a woman is 
greater than that expended by a man in doing the same work. 

There are other circumstances in the life of the female which 
influence the demand for food. It is said that the internal secretion 
of the ovaries facilitates the oxidation of carbohydrates and the 
organized phosphorus of the food. Females are subject to a wave 
of metabolic activity which reaches its climax just before each 
menstrual period: during the rise of this wave there is an increase 
in the nitrogen metabolism, but a diminution in the carbon metab- 
olism; at the same time there is a formation of new blood-cells, an 
increasing amount of nerve force and general vigour, and a feeling 
of bicn-etre. A woman gains 1-5 to 5 per cent, of her total weight 
during the intermenstrual ])eriod, which is partly due to diminished 
excretion of carbonic acid and water. But during the menstrual 
period there is a corresponding loss of weight, owing to an increased 
excretion of carbonic acid and water, although the protein metab- 
olism is diminished, as shown by a diniinution in the excretion of 
nitrogen during " the period." 

There are few reports of experiments to show the effects 
of pregnancy upon metabolism. But deductions drawn from 
such experiments on animals are applicable to the human being. 
Reprev found that during pregnancy the organism assimilates more 
food and rejects less. The cleavage of pro tern is greater during 
pregnancy and lactation than during sexual rest; but less urea and 
phosphates are excreted in the urine than under normal conditions, 
and the excretion diminishes as pregnancy proceeds. In other 
words, assimilation is intensified while excretion is diminished, 
and nicnjgen and phosphorus are stored in the body. Hagemann 
also found that during pregnancy and lactation more nitrogen is 
retained to meet the unusual demands of the organism. Oddi and 
Vicarelli studied the influence of pregnancy on the respiratory 
quotient; they arrived at the conclusion that gestation is charac- 
terized by an increased combustion of carbohydrates in the tissues, 
but that part of the carbon and nitrogen of the food is utilized 
in the formation of new tissues — in other words, for the nutrition 
and development of the foetus. 

In this condition, therefore, an allowance of food must be made 
to provide for the growing embryo. At about the middle term 
of pregnancy the fcetus weighs 0-5 kilo, in the seventh month from 
I to 1-5 kilos, in the eighth month from 1-5 to 25 kilos, and in the 
last month from 3 to 5 kilos. The foetus increases in weight during 
the last three months at the average rate of 21 5 to 205 granunes 
per da}', with a maxinunn of 65 granuues per day during the last 



92 THE AMOl'XT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

month. But the woman also increases in weight during the preg- 
nancy, in spite of the increased combustion of non-nitrogenous 
elements; for the uterus and breasts increase in size, and there is 
usually a deposition of fat in the adipose tissue. An increase of 
food, therefore, is demanded, and it is considered that for the 
last three months of pregnancy a daily allowance of 3 grammes of 
protein, 35 grammes of fat, and 075 gramme of mineral salts, 
per kilo of body-neigJii, with sufficient carboh}'drate to assist in 
meeting the increased metabolism of carbon, should form the 
standard to guide us in prescribing food for this period. This 
means practically that the woman should consume double the 
ordinary amount of meat, and have an unlimited quantity of 
bread, butter, etc. 

The gain of weight during pregnancy is usually lost in the period 
of lactation, and the body is likely to emaciate unless the standard 
of food be kept up to something near that allowed for the last three 
months of pregnancy. A woman secretes 700 to 800, or even 
1,000, c.c. of milk daily, containing roughly 15 to 21 grammes of 
protein, 26 to 35 grammes of fat, 45 to 60 grammes of sugar, and 
from 490 to 660 calories. The energy of producing the milk has 
also to be taken into account. The total increased expenditure of 
energy on the part of the mother may be anything from 600 to 
1,000 or more calories. An extra allowance of food is required 
for the nursing mother, and it must be sufficient to protect her 
from the debilitating effect of the great drain en her system. The 
kind of food consumed by the mother is of importance, although 
the proportion of solids-noi-fat in her milk is only slightl}" dependent 
upon it. The consumption of carbohydrates — e.g., starch — does 
not increase the yield of milk nor the proportion of milk-sugar. 
The consumption of fat has little influence upon the amount of fat 
in the milk; the quantity of fat in the milk is greatest when most 
protein is consumed, least when starch is consumed. The absolute 
and relative proportion of protein in the milk, although ultimately 
derived from the food, is not directh' proportional to the protein 
consumed; it increases a little with a large consumption of meat, 
and decreases a little during fasting.^ Cotton-seed cake increases 
the secretion of milk in cattle; and lactagol, a preparation of cotton- 
seed, increases the protein and fat in human milk. Milk is a 
genuine secretion of the mammary gland, and not a mere filtration 
from the blood. It depends upon an active growth and metabolism 
of the cells of the acini. The food therefore must be such as will 
stimulate metabolism and supply the materials used b}- the body 
for its production. All the circumstances being considered, the 
conclusion is arrived at that an extra allowance of meat is demanded 
by the body ; and cow's milk, which is largely similar to it, is capable

6. The Food should be Proportional to the Work to be done.— 
Food is fuel. The amount of food required by an adult depends 
more upon the amount of work done by the body than any other 
factor. This dictum follows as a necessary corollary to the demon- 
stration that the body is a machine. The more energy is expended 
by the machine in doing work, the more fuel must be consumed 
to yield that energy. Zuntz calculated that the amount of energy 
expended by a man following a sedentary occupation, such as 
writing and reading, was from 30 to 50 per cent, more than would 
be expended during absolute rest of his body, and this was again 
increased 30 per cent, by moderate work, and still more by severe 
work; and he estimated the daily expenditure of energy to be as 
follows : 

Expenditure of Energy per Day. 

During absolute rest 1,700 calories. 

Sedentary life in a room . . . . 2,200 to 2,250 

Doing moderate work . . . . . . 3.000 to 3,250 

The work of the human machinery is divided into internal and 
external work. The internal work of the organism is performed by 
the organs of digestion, circulaLion, respiration, and the nervous 
system in maintaining the temperature of the body, the tone of the 
muscular system, supplying the secretions and excretions. The 
performance of all these functions is essential to life, whence they 
are called the " vegetative functions." The energy expended in the 
performance of some of these functions can be estimated. Thus, 
the work of the heart alone amounts to 70,000 or 75,000 kilo- 
gramme-metres, involving an expenditure of 176-5 calories of energy 
per diem; that of the organs of respiration 12,000 to 20,000 kilo- 
gramme-metres; and the work of the other internal organs requires 
a proportionate expenditure. The internal work is going on even 
during absolute rest, and, according to Zuntz, the energy expended 
by the whole body is 1,700 calories. Atwater found, by the observa- 
tion of people in a respiratory calorimeter, that a subject awake and 
sitting perfectly still used 80 per cent, more energy than the same 
subject during sleep; that a man awake and sitting perfectly stiH, 
controlling all his movements as much as possible, could reduce his 
expenditure one-third, as shown by the amount of material oxidized 
or the expiration of CO,; that on days when food was taken, a man 
excreted 20 per cent, more CO, than he did on fasting days, and 
this oxidation of material he considered was due to the expenditure 
of energv to carr\- on the work of digestion and assimilation. 

External Work.— A much greater increase in the amount of CO, 
expired and heat radiated from the body occurs during exercise 
of the voluntary muscles — which is denominated " work." Atwater 
found that a man in the respiratory calorimeter evolved during 
two hours' rest 150 calories; when working a stationary bicycle

for t\No hours. 500 caloric^s; ami wiion workiiii; the same bicycle 
against resistance for the same time, 1,000 calories. It is evident, 
therefore, that food must be supplied in proportion to the work 
to be performed, otherwise the substance or tissues of the body 
will be consumed as fuel to supply the energy expended. It is 
surjirising how readily the organism makes use of its own substance. 
There is no doubt, iumever, that the glycogen stored up in the 
liver and muscles is first used up; and when that is exhausted, if 
the supply of food is unequal to the fuel consumed, the organism 
makes use of the protein and fat of the tissues to- make up the 
deficiency. Some idea of the tissues consumed when food is 
deficient may be gleaned from a case of starvation. Foster* 
quotes the case of a cat of known weight which was starved for 
thirteen days. An analysis of its bod}' was made after death. 
During the period of starvation it lost 734 grammes of solid sub- 
stance, of which 2488 grammes was fat, ii8-2 grammes was muscle, 
and the remainder was derived from the organs of the body. The 
]")ercentage loss was determined to be as follows: 

Losses during Starvation. 

The adipose tissue lost 97-0 per cent, of its weight. 

The spleen ,, 63*1 

The liver ,, 56-6 

The muscles ,, 30-2 

The blood ,, 17*6 

The nervous system ,, oo-o „ 

These figures show that the greatest loss falls upon the accumu- 
lated fat, seeing that the adipose tissue disappears almost entirely 
during starvation. Next to this the glandular organs, especially 
the spleen and liver, are drawn upon for fuel; then the skeletal 
muscles; while the blood suffers proportionately to the general 
waste. It might be assumed from these figures that metabolism 
is the most active in the adipose tissue, and next in the liver and 
spleen, but there is no warrant for that assumption. The loss of 
cardiac and nervous tissue during star\ation is exceedingly small; 
but we cannot, ort that account, conclude that their metabolism 
is feeble. On the other hand, they may undergo rapid metabolism, 
and yet be preserved from wasting by drawing upon other tissues 
to support their nutrition. The enormous loss of adipose tissue 
during deficient supply of nutriment is due to the fact that this 
tissue is a storehouse for fat, which it readily yields on demand. 
The great loss by the liver and spleen indicates that they also serve 
as storehouses. The muscles are storehouses of glycogen, and 
from this source muscular energy is first derived. During the 
period of starvation the urine of the cat contained 277 grammes 
of nitrogen; the amount of muscle wasted during the same period 
contained 15-2 grammes of nitrogen; therefore more than half the

nitrogen utilizrd during llir starvation period was drrivcd from 
tlie nu'tabolisni of muscular tissue?. The muscles, however, were 
not the only source of nitrogen, some having been derived fn m the 
metabolism of nitrogenous fats, and some from the nitrogenous 
materials of the bones and spleen. The amount of nitrogen excreted 
falls very rapidly during the first day or two of abstinence from 
food — that is, while stored proteins are being consumed^ — and then 
diminishes very gradually. The heat-value of i gramme of body- 
protein is 565 calories, and i gramme of body-fat 9-54 calories.^ 

Energy. — We must now inquire how the demand for energy is 
varied by rest and work. It will be proper, first of all, to give 
a standard balance-sheet of the food and energy. The following, 
part of which is previously given, will answer our purpose. Ex- 
periments were made by Ranke, a physiologist, upon his own 
body. His duties as a physician and lecturer involved but a small 
expenditure of mechanical energy in external muscular work, and 
he was able to maintain his weight (75 kilos) and nitrogenous 
equilibrium upon a diet containing 100 grammes of protein, 
100 grammes of fat, and 240 grammes of carbohydrate, yielding 
2,310 calories. The balance-sheet given on p. 96 shows the income 
and expenditure of the body in matter and energy. 

Now, 2,310 calories of heat, when transformed into mechanical 
work, is equivalent to 980,000 kilogramme-metres, or in round 
numbers one million. The energy which is expended in work was 
estimated by Parkes in the form of foot-ions. His figures have 
not been impugned by more recent in\'estigations, and therefore 
are given below as illustrating the amount of energy expended in 
various forms of work :

through one-twentieth of the distance walked. At tliis particular 
rate of walking the coefficient of traction or resistance is one-twentieth. 
At quicker rates of speed it diminishes, and approaches unity; e.g., 
at eight miles an hour it is barely one-tenth. The amount of work 
done, in foot-tons, is calculated as follows: Let \\' = weight of the 
man; W' = the weight carried; D = the distance walked in miles; 
and C = the coefficient of traction. Then — 

„ - X C = foot-tons. 

2240 

It is thereby found that a man weighing 160 pounds, carrying no 
weight, and walking seventeen miles at three miles an hour, per- 
forms work equal to about 300 foot-tons. 

The more acti\'e the body, the greater is the production of heat; 
and more food is oxidized during the performance of work than is 
transformed into mechanical energy. The experimental evidence 
obtained by Atwater and Benedict upon metabolism is of great 
value as illustrating this point (see table on p. 98). 

It is evident that the supply of food must be in proportion to 
the work done; and this is in accord with experience that the food 
should vary as the kind and amount of work done. Examples are 
as follows ; 

(i) Intellectual Work. — Ranke, a professor, found that a diet 
yielding 2,310 calories was sufficient to maintain him in health, 
to keep his organism in nutritive equilibrium, and maintain his 
nitrogen balance, while following his ordinary avocation, which was 
chiefly intellectual. He estimated that 15 per cent, of the energy 
of his food was expended in doing muscular work. 

(2) Ordinary Light Work causes a loss of about 3,000 calories, or 
units of heat, by the body, of which little more than 15 per cent, 
is spent in the performance of muscular work. 

(3) Moderate Muscular Work performed for a period of eight 
hours causes the body to lose about 3,500 to 4,000 calories, about 
20 per cent, being mechanical energy. 

(4) Severe Muscular Work during the same period causes from 
4,500 to 6,500 calories, or units of heat, to be radiated from the 
body. In all manual labour the best and most economical results 
are obtained when certain groups of muscles are trained for their 
work. An untrained man becomes readily exhausted, and gives 
out a greater amount of heat in proportion to the work done. 
The trained worker can do the same amount of work much more 
easily, with less exhaustion, and with a smaller expenditure of 
energy or loss of heat. Walking, running, rowing, cycling, are 
examples of muscular work where the muscles can be trained to 
work with economy and the greatest possible advantage. Foot- 
ball and navvy- work cannot l3e done with the same economy of 
energy, because most of the muscles of the body are brought into 
action.

common t'xix-ririici' have >lio\\ii lliai the muscular \\(jrk done by 
an in(li\itlual camiot be increased over a long period without a 
corresponding increase of food. Work to the amount of 100,000 
kilogramme-metres can be sustained da}' after da\' without much 
inconvenience and without loss of weight; but work represented by 
124,000 kilogramme-metres cannot be kept up very long without a 
considerable increase of diet, and even then there may be a loss of 
weight and vigour. It has also been shown that the amount of 
food must be more than enough to supply the extra amount of 
energy expended in labour. A reference to a few other observa- 
tions upon this matter may be of interest: 

(a) Men. — (i) Zuntz found that men yield from jo to 35 per cent, 
of their energy in the performance of muscular work. (2) Atwater 
found that an individual doing ordinary muscular work does not 
expend more than 20 per cent, of the energy of his food in mechanical 
labour; e.g., when working a stationary bicycle in a respiratory 
calorimeter, out of 100 calories, or units of heat, produced by the 
body, only 20 calories, or one-fifth, were transformed into energy 
by working the pedals. The proportion was somewhat greater 
with light work and less with sev'ere work, and greater, again, when 
the work was prolonged. (3) Ranke found in his own case, repre- 
senting very light work, that only 15 per cent, of his energy was 
spent in the form of muscular work. 

{b) Horses. — -Kellner and Wolff found that horses reproduce 
35 per cent, of their energy in the form of work. 

(c) Dogs. — Zuntz found that dogs can reproduce 35 per cent, of 
their energy in work. 

(d) Engines. — (i) An ordinary oil or steam engine yields 15 to 
22 per cent, of the energy from fuel consumed, as mechanical work. 
(2) The best oil-engine will yield not more than 33 per cent, of the 
energy of its fuel, in mechanical work. 

Wlien calculating the amount of food required for additional 
work done, Atwater's estimates are of service. His figures show- 
that 20 per cent, of the food would be expended in mechanical 
work, and 80 per cent, dissipated as heat, and that at least five 
times the number of calories must be provided to yield the requisite 
energy for a given amount of work. When hard work is being 
done, about 15 per cent, of the energy is derived from the food, and 
therefore the allow-ance should be six times the amount of mechan- 
ical work to be done. When the work is very exhausting or pro- 
longed, especially if carried out under adverse circumstances, so 
that tired muscles are called upon to contract, the efficiency of the 
machinery is lowered; it does not get so much energy out of the 
food — or, rather, a much larger calorific expenditure occurs in pro- 
ducing the work— and considerably more than 3,500 calories will 
be expended. This probably accounts for the large consumption 
of food by brickmakers, lumbermen, navvies, and scavengers, 
which has been recorded by various authorities. By using Atwater's 
figures for the amount of energy transformed into mechanical work

The necessity for increasing the allowance of food in proportion 
to the work the body is expected to do has always been recognized 
by scientific men, and the table on p. loi gives the figures of 
Playfair,^ with the corresponding amounts of matter and energy 
in grammes and calories estimated by Rubner's factors. 

Some examples of the food known to be consumed by people are 
given in the table on p. 102. 

Many investigators have made observations upon the food con- 
sumed by individuals who were allowed a free choice of food, and, 
finding that, with diets having the values given above, such persons' 
nutrition was fairly normal and their nitrogen balance in a state of 
equilibrium, they concluded that the diet fairly well represented 
the amount required by these persons. 

The list of examples of food consumed given on p. 102, compiled 
from data collected in Europe, Asia, and America, shows that, when 
Europeans and Americans are free to choose their own food, they 
seldom select what will yield less than 100 grammes of protein per 
diem. It is, in fact, quite unusual for Europeans and Americans of 
the male sex to consume less than 90 grammes of protein per diem 
when the choice of food rests with the individual. There are 
many thousands of individuals who perforce must consume a 
smaller quantity of protein, because meat, fish, fowl, milk, eggs, 
and cheese, are dearer than bread, potato, rice, oatmeal, etc. But 
when all the circumstances were taken into consideration by Voit, 
it was established by him as a rule that the afnount of protein re- 
quired daily was from 1-4 to i-y grammes per kilo of body-weight, 
and that 119 grammes of protein and 2,800 to 3,000 calories were 
sufficient to meet the requirements of a man of 154 pounds (70 kilos) 
when doing light work. Maurel,^ who has devoted much attention 
to the subject, found that, to maintain the body in nitrogenous 
equilibrium w^hen no muscular work is being performed, the adult 
in full health and vigour requires 1-5 grammes of protein and 
35 to 38 calories of energy per kilo of body-weight, and that any 
muscular work must be met by an increased supply of nutriment.

riius, u man iveighing 154 puiinds (70 kilos) would require for main- 
tenance 105 grammes of protein and 2,450 to 2,660 calories of energy ; 
and a woman of 132 pounds (60 kilos) ivoiild require 90 grammes of 
protein and 2,100 to 2,280 calories of energy. These figures are 
probably near the mark. 

In a discussion on " The Food Requirements for Sustenance and 
Work " at the 1910 meeting of the British Medical Association, ^ 
Colonel Melville gave an example of men doing a measured amount 
of work with a measured quantity of food. Twenty soldiers walked 
for periods of five and six days an average of twelve to thirteen 
miles, carrying their kit, the weight of which averaged 54 pounds 
(24-5 kilos). The average weight of the men was 141 pounds 
(64-15 kilos). The expenditure of energy was calculated froiu 
Zuntz's factors: For every kilo transported horizontally at the 
rate of 94 metres (102 yards) per minute the expenditure was 
o-ooo6 calorie; and for every kilo raised i metre vertically the 
expenditure was 0-0075 calorie; whence it was determined that 
the average expenditure in walking one mile and carrying 54 pounds 
over an ordinary give-and-take road was 90 calories, and the total 
daily expenditure in external or mechanical work amounted to 
1,034 calories. Melville therefore estimated that the total energy 
expended by these men was as follows:

(c) Energy spent in walking and carrying load .. .. .. .. 1,034 



Total average daih' expenditure . . . . 4.034 

The march was done on six days continuously; then one day's 
rest intervened before the second period of five days' walking 
completed the work done. The food consumed was as follows:

There was therefore, according to the calculation for work done, 
a deficiency of 890 calories in the food. Is this supposed deficiency 

1 Brit. Med. Jour., 1910, ii. 1337-1340. 



I04 THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

an actual deficiency ? The allowance of protein in the first week 
(190 grammes) was distinctly high, and 30 per cent, above the 
amount allowed in barracks; at the same time the carbohydrate 
was increased 2^ per cent. But there was an actual deficiency, 
as shown by the loss of body-weight by the men. The loss of 
weight averaged 2-68 pounds (1-22 kilos) for the maximum period, 
and 2-2 pounds (i kilo) for the whole period. During the last five 
days of the experiment there was an average daily loss of 234 
grammes, or just over half a pound. If the material lost consisted 
onl)" of fat, it would yield 234 x 9-3 =2,176 calories, whereas the 
estimated loss was 890 calories. It is evident, therefore, that the 
muscles suffered loss as well as the adipose tissue. In a case of 
starvation under the observation of Benedict, previously quoted, 
the loss of energy measured by the calorimeter was 1,696 calories 
daily, and the loss of weight averaged 18^ ounces (526 grammes) 
daily; the loss probabl}^ consisted of 69-5 grammes of protein, 139-6 
granmies of fat, and 23 grammes of glycogen. If the loss of weight 
by the soldiers under observation be assumed to fall on the tissues 
in the same proportion, the energy provided by the consumption 
of their own tissues should have been as follows: 

Loss by soldiers = 234 grammes 

J r 7 — I T- X i,6g6 caloiies =756 calories. 

Loss by case of starvation =525 grammes ' 

The agreement with the estimated deficiency is pretty close. 
Considering the amount of protein consumed, Melville found the 
allowance of 190 grammes — practically 3 grammes per kilo of 
body-weight — should be the maximum allowance; but if this erred 
on the side of generosity, he had no hesitation in saying that the 
allowance of 145 grammes, or 2-25 grammes of protein per kilo^ 
should be the minimum allowance for work — i.e., it is as low as it 
is advisable to go — and might well be increased when hard work 
is demanded of the men, especially with exposure to the hardships 
of camp life and the inevitable vicissitudes of active service. 

Chittenden, however, made a series of most careful observations 
on persons who consumed a low protein diet; it included not more 
than half the amount prescribed by the standard diets or that con- 
sumed by the majority of people who have free choice of food. 
He did this because he was not satisfied that the standards drawn 
up by Voit, Atwater, and other observers, from a consideration 
of the dietetic habits of the people, represented the tni( physio- 
logical requirements of the body. He aimed at a demonstration 
of the true physiological nutritive requirements of the body, which 
he based upon the following four points: The maintenance of 
(i) the nitrogen equilibrium; (2) the physiological equilibrium, or 
body-weight; (3) the physiological efficiency; and (4) the ability to 
resist disease. 

Chittenden was induced to undertake his series of observations 
by Horace Fletcher, who for five years practised a rigid economy 
in diet in association with elaborate and prolonged mastication 



PROTEIN REQUIREMENT 105 

(see Fletcherisni). Fletcher believed that prolonged and ex- 
ceedingly careful mastication of the food would reduce the amount 
required by the body to about one-half the standard diets. At the 
end of five years he was able to perform the trying and arduous 
work of a University oarsman on a diet possessing only 40 per cent, 
of the protein and about 50 per cent, of the calorie value of the 
standard diets; nevertheless he was in sound health, and his efforts 
as an oarsman compared favourably with those of men who con- 
sumed the ordinary diet.^ 

Chittenden then experimented with a group of athletes whose 
nitrogen consumption was reduced to 55 grammes of protein daily. 

A second group consisted of soldiers who lived for five months 
with a nitrogen metabolism of 7 to 8 grammes per day, and for 
whom an allowance of 50 grammes of protein daily was sufficient 
for the needs of the body, the calorie value of the food remaining as 
usual. 

A third group consisted of professional men, who were under 
observation for a period of six to nine months. In these it was 
shown to be possible to maintain the nitrogen balance in equilibrium, 
the body-weight undiminished, and the organism in health and 
vigour, during the entire period, with a daily metabolism in the 
different persons of 5-4 to 8-99 grammes of nitrogen — -that is, 
with the use of 34 to 56 grammes of protein daily. 

As a result of these experiments, Chittenden believes that 
o-i to 0-12 gramme of metabohzable nitrogen, or 0-625 to 
0-75 gramme of protein, per kilo of body-weight, represents the 
protein requirements of the body in the ordinary conditions of life, 
and an allowance of 50 to 60 grammes of protein daily — i.e., about 
half the usual quantity of absorbable protein — is an ample provision 
for a man weighing 60 to 70 kilos. 

These amounts are considered by Chittenden to satisfy the 
physiological requirements of the body, which he establishes from 
the following considerations: All but a very small part of the 
protein taken as food rapidly passes out of the bod}' as urea, the 
excretion of urea being in proportion to the amount of protein 
consumed. The experiments of Folin indicate that all the nitrogen 
arising from the metabolism of tissue protein is represented in the 
urine by the creatin and uric acid, and that the urea represents 
the nitrogen of the food. Folin's theor}^ is supported by observa- 
tions. Liebig observed in hunted foxes that the creatin was ten 
times as much as in normal muscle; and Gregor found the creatin 
in the urine of a man rose from 0-57 to 1-34 grammes per diem 
after fourteen hours' cycling. Chittenden therefore considers that 
an allowance of o-io to 0-12 gramme of nitrogen, or 0-625 to 0-75 
gramme of protein, per kilo of body-weight, is quite adequate for 
physiological needs, provided a sufficient amount of non-nitrogenous 

' The calorie value of food consumed is not altered by the care exercised 
in mastication, but the digestibility is altered thereby. Coefficients of diges- 
tibility are dealt with in another chapter. 



io6 THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

food is taken to meet the energy requirements of the body; in 
other words, that it is possible to maintain the body in health 
and perform hard work on less than half the amount of protein 
considered to be the standard or normal requirement. In con- 
firmation of this he points to the vegetarians, fruitarians, and 
various races of people, such as the Indian Brahmins, the Japanese, 
and others, who enjoy health and vigour on a low protein diet. 
He further states^ " that the consimiption of proteins by people 
in general far beyond the requirements of the body to maintain 
liealth, strength, vigour, and the weight of the body, constitutes 
a condition of over-nutrition as serious in its menace to the health 
and welfare of the human race as many other evils of a more striking 
character." These are strong words, and they constitute a serious 
indictment of the investigations of a galaxy of men whose decisions 
have hitherto been considered to have great authority and weight 
in the scientific world. Nevertheless, observations by other men 
than Chittenden give rise to thought, for thej^ establish a new 
standard for protein. Some of these experiments should be con- 
sidered. It would be well to compare the nitrogen metabolism of 
people when (i) fasting, (2) on nitrogen-free diet, (3) on low protein 
diet, and (4) on ordinary diet. And it should be premised that — 

1. Nitrogen equilibrium means an equality between the nitrogen 
consumed and that excreted in the urine, faeces, and other excreta. 

2. If more nitrogen is excreted than ingested, the body-proteins 
(stored and tissue proteins) are being consumed. Moreover, it is 
possible under such circumstances, when the fat and carbohydrate 
are sufficient, for the body to increase in weight owing to an accu- 
mulation of fat in the tissues. 

3. If less nitrogen is excreted than consumed, " the body is laying 
on flesh " — that is, there is an increase of the nitrogenous tissues. 
Under certain circumstances, such as " training," this may occur 
without any increase of the body-weight, or even when the body is 
losing weight, owing to the combustion of the fatty moiety of the pro- 
tein molecule and similar constituents of the non-nitrogenous food. 

4. When the nitrogenous metabolism is maintained, the protein 
elements of the body undergo very little change; under these cir- 
cumstances the tissue elements are replaced as the}' become worn 
out, but they are not increased in weight or bulk. 

The examples given in the table on p. 107 show that when no 
nitrogen is taken for twenty-four hours the amount of nitrogen 
excreted varies from 7-5 to 12 grammes, the variation probably 
being due to a difference in the amount of stored protein and glycogen 
in the organs and tissues. But the stored protein and glycogen is all 
consumed in a few days, and after a period, say, of five days all 
the nitrogen of the excretions is derived from the disintegration of 
body-prolein — that is, organized or tissue protein. The table 
shows that the amount of nitrogen excreted by the kidneys from 
the fifth day of starvation averages about 45 grammes per diem.

lo8 THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

If we allow a margin of i gramme for other modes of excretion — 
e.g., by the skin and mucous surfaces — we arrive at the conclusion 
that t/ic amount of protein ic-hich is absolutely essential to prevent 
the destruction of tissue-proteins is N 5-5 x()-25=34 gt''t»'>f'<-'^ daily, 
or about 0-5 gramme of protein per kilo of body-iceigJit. This amount, 
therefore, may be considered the physiological minimum. The 
question remains to be considered. Is it advisable to keep too near 
the physiological mininmm ? It was after numerous observations 
that Voit concluded that a man doing ordinary work required 
17 grammes of protein per kilo of body-weight, or 119 grammes 
daily, but a variation of 1-4 to i-y per kilo was permissible. Since 
his experiments many others have been made. Klemperer gave 
considerable attention to the subject — e.g., he made an investigation 
into the amount of nitrogen actually required by two young men. 
They took a diet consisting of bread, butter, bouillon, grape-sugar, 
beer, and cognac. It contained 30 to ^^ grammes of protein, but 
an abundance of fat and carbohydrate. Both subjects consumed 
the diet for eight days. At first they lost a considerable amount of 
nitrogen {stored protein), but this became smaller, and during the 
last three days there was a slight retention of nitrogen, showing 
that the amount consumed was quite sufficient for the needs of 
their organism, which used a considerable amount of fat and carbo- 
hydrate in place of protein. He therefore arrived at the conclusion 
that strong and healthy persons can maintain their nitrogen metab- 
olism in equilibiium on a diet containing 30 to 40 grammes of protein 
daily, providing the assimilation of fat and carbohydrate is assisted 
by the consumption of alcohol. But he does not advocate the idea 
that healthy individuals should abandon the ordinary standard of 
diet. He believes that Voit's standard represents the amount most 
suited to the needs of a healthy individual doing ordinary work. 
The case is different in a diseased person ; the object then is not to 
maintain a high protein level, which is only possible when the 
excretion of nitrogen is large, but rather to help the organism to 
form new protein ; and the latter onl}' takes place when the excretion 
of nitrogen is small. ^ 

Siven's experiments showed that a nitrogen metabolism could 
be maintained in equilibrium with a daily consumption of about 
0-5 gramme of protein and 41 calories per kilo, or 28 to 30 grammes 
of protein and a total of 2,444 calories daily. 

Hirschfield found the nitrogenous equilibrium maintained with 
47 grammes of protein daily, or 0-63 gramme per kilo and 47 calories 
per kilo. 

Pechsel undertook to determine the amount of protein necessary 
for his own body; he weighed 169 pounds (7G kilos). He con- 
sidered Rubner's work in nutrition of especial value, and accepted 
his data — viz.; 100 grammes of fat = 240 grammes of starch = 249 
grammes of sugar = 770 grammes of fresh muscle flesh free from 
fat, and that the nutrients could be substituted for one another

in those proportions. There was, however, tliis Hmitation: some 
protein was necessary to repair the waste of nitrogenous tissue whicii 
is continually going on, and to make up for the loss of portions of 
the epidermis, liair, nails, epithelial cells, etc. Pechsel's investiga- 
tions were undertaken, under the direction of Von Xoorden, to ascer- 
tain the amount of protein necessary for himself. He consumed a 
diet consisting of bread, rice, potatoes, butter, sugar, tea, etc., hut 
no meat. First of all his dietary contained 39 or 40 grammes of 
protein and yielded 3,640 calories. Nitrogenous equilibrium was 
reached on the fifth day — that is, the protein was enough to meet 
the needs of the body, and the organism was sufficiently supplied 
with fat and carbohydrate. He next reduced the protein to 32 
grammes daily, the calorie value of the food being 3,600; but the 
organism continued to lose nitrogen — that is, 32 grammes of protein 
daily was less than the smallest quantity needed by a person of his 
weight to maintain nitrogenous equilibrium. He concluded, how- 
ever, that Voit's standard for protein is far above the amount 
actually needed, provided the organism is well supplied with fat 
and carbohydrate.

It is undoubted that individuals can live for some time with no 
nitrogenous food, and with no food at all ; but such experiments are 
of no physiological value beyond assisting to determine, from the 
metabolism of nitrogen on a nitrogen-free diet or during starvation, 
the amount of protein needed daily to prevent the disintegration 
of the bodily tissues. But the observations of Chittenden, Hirsch- 
field, Klemperer, Pechsel, Paton, and others, clearly demonstrate 
that it is possible to maintain life, keep the body in nitrogen 
equilibrium, and do a certain amount of work, on a diet having 
the standard calorie value, but containing a very much smaller 
amount of protein than is given in the standard dietaries. If there 
be added, to the 34 grammes of protein established as the physio- 
logical minimum necessary to prevent tissue destruction, about 
10 or 15 grammes of protein, making a total of 44 to 50 grammes 
of protein daily, it is argued that there will be an ample provision

tt) maintain thr body in lu-allli and vit,'onr, and that anytliing 
above that amount will immodiatoly bo broken down into a fatty 
moiety and a urea moiety, the fatty moiety being oxidized to yield 
heat or stored up in the adipose tissues, and the urea moiety at 
once turned out by the body in the form of urea. 

It should next be inquired liow far the need for protein food is 
influenced by work. It is clearly possible for protein food alone 
to supply all the energy required by the body, as well as to maintain 
the bod}' in nutritive and nitrogenous equilibrium. But whether 
it is necessary or even advantageous for the body to derive a large 
part of its energy from protein food is another matter. There are 
people who perforce live upon meat, game, or fish, almost exclusively 
during six or nine months of tlie year. In such cases the energy of 
the bod}' is derived from the fatty moiet}' of the protein molecule, 
or from the carbohydrate complex which exists in many proteins. 
But what we require to know is whether work increases the bodily 
demand for protein food. Pfliiger advanced the theory that protein 
is tlie source of all muscular energ}'. Against the theory is the fact 
that no evidence lias been adduced which clearly shows that there 
is any change in the condition of the muscle proteins when the 
muscle contracts. Hermann's theory of muscular contraction 
assumes that there is a change in the muscular proteins similar to 
that which occurs in rigor mortis. But nobody has actually 
observed the formation of a clot of myosin during the contraction 
of muscle. We have, howe^■e^, the evidence afforded by the 
excretion of nitrogen ; for it may safely be asserted that, if protein 
be the source of muscular energy, the exercise of the muscles will 
materially increase the excretion of nitrogenous waste products. 
It may be stated at once that this is far from being the case. 
Kriimmacher made observations which he believed supported 
Pfliiger's theory. For fourteen days he took daily, a regular diet 
containing protein 102-4, ^^t 43-3, and carbohydrate 230, grammes, 
and did a certain amount of muscular work; his nitrogen balance 
during periods of rest and work was as follows;

The work consisted of the ascent of mountains. These and later 
observations made by him led to the conclusion that the cleavage of 
protein is increased by musctdar uork, hut the cleavage is less in 
proportion as the supply of non-protein to protein food increases,

and is no/ directly connected wit/i the utnounl of work performed. If 
it vviTO possible, he says, during a ])eri()d of work to supply the 
muscle cells continuously with a sufficient amount of nitrogen-free 
energy-producing material, there would be no increase in the quantity 
of protein broken down. 

Jones investigated the case of Schmehl, wlio walked 500 miles 
in six days, or an average of 83^ miles a day. During this period 
his food consisted of beef-steak, eggs, beef-tea, champagne, and 
aerated waters. The observer found that the severe exertion caused 
an increased excretion of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and sulphuric 
acid. On the first day of the walk the urea amounted to 63 grammes, 
on the last day to 39 grammes, so that tlie excretion gradually 
diminished during the experiment. It should be observed that 
the diet influences the amount of urea excreted. A man in a state 
of equilibrium and on an ordinary mixed diet excretes daily from 
25 to 40 grammes, or an average of 33 grammes, of urea. When the 
diet is poor in protein it sinks to 15 or 20 grammes; when it is rich 
in protein it may rise to 90 or 100 grammes per diem. 

Dunlop, Paton, Stockmann, and Maca:lam\ found that there is 
an increase in the total nitrogen of the urine after severe exertion, 
chiefly as urea, creatinin, and preformed ammonia; there is also 
an increase of sulphates and phosphates, but much sweating 
diminishes the water, chlorides, and sodium, of the urine. If the 
subject is in poor condition, there is a rise in the excretion of uric 
acid, creatinin and other nitrogenous extractives, and phosphoric 
acid. Increased work leads to increased katabolism of muscle 
protein in such cases; this is supported by the fact that uric acid, 
nitrogenous extractives, and phosphoric acid, are not increased by 
work in well-fed healthy subjects. 

An investigation was carried out by Atwater and Sherman upon 
Miller, who succeeded in riding 2,007 miles in six days without 
showing signs of physical or mental weakness at the end. Miller 
was a short man, twenty-four years old; the fuel value of his food 
was 50 per cent, above that of standard dietaries, and contained 
from 169 to 211 grammes of protein daily. Estimates were made 
of the food consumed; the urine and faeces were analyzed, and 
showed that the protein metabolized in his body was more than tJiat 
in his food. 

An investigation made on Weston the pedestrian showed that 
when he took enough protein to keep up his nitrogenous equilibrium 
he consumed more protein per diem than Miller. Flint ^ and Pavy^ 
arrived at different results in this case; but Flint concluded from it 
that severe muscular exertion increases the excretion of nitrogen 
considerably. 

The amount of nitrogen excreted by men during and after exertion 
depends to a considerable extent upon the " condition " of the

body. A bod}' in .uood condition contains an unknown quantity 
of stored protein, which has not become organized into muscular 
tissue, and is readily available as a source of energy. It appears 
therefore that, in order to ascertain the amount of nitrogen excreted 
as the result of nuiscular exertion, the stored ])rotein ought to be 
got rid of. In the case of North, ^ who exjxTimented upon himself, 
an attempt was made to do this. He abstained from food for 
thirty-six hours before tlie commencement of his observations. 
He then took foot! of which the exact chemical composition had been 
ascertained, and his urine and faeces wen; analyzed. For four 
days he followed his ordinary occupation, and the fifth day he 
walked thirty-two miles and carried iy\ pounds, and on the suc- 
ceeding four da}'s he followed his ordinary occupation. The results 
were as follows: The nitrogen excreted during his ordinary occupa- 
tion was 15-2 grammes per day, after thirty-two miles' walk 17-95 
grammes, or an increase of 273 grammes, equivalent to about 
18 grammes of protein daily; the excretion of })hosphoric acid was 
increased from 3-59 to 4-19 grammes daily, and the sulphuric acid 
from 274 to 2-97 grammes. The analysis showed that the sul- 
phuric acid in the food was insignificant ; therefore that in the urine 
was derived from the metabolism of tissue protein; and it was 
increased in proportion to the amount of work done. The increase 
of phosphoric acid was not great, and might be considered within 
the limits of experimental error but for the fact that the amount of 
phosphorus in myosin is very small, and according to Kiihne is nil. 
By means of repeated analyses Kolpakcha found that in meat the 
PgOg! N:: i: 7-3; in white of eggs PgOg: N:: i: 47-6; gelatin con- 
tains no phosphorus. With these facts he was able to determine 
the amount of tissue-protein or stored protein which was broken 
down. During a period of fasting the stored protein is first broken 
do\NTi, and it is not until it is exhausted that the organism reaches 
a condition when tissue-protein is used; and it may be assumed 
that tissue-protein alone is being broken down when the ratio in 
the urine of PgO^: N:: i: 3-9 or 4-1. In animals living entirely 
upon flesh the ratio in the urine of PgOg: N:: i: 7-3, which is about 
the same as in meat. In North's experiment, having used his 
stored protein, the PgOgi N:: i: 4-3, which closely approximates 
to Kolpakcha's estimate for tissue-protein; and the amount of 
nitrogen excreted daily was increased 15-5 per cent. Muscular 
contraction therefore increases the total output of nitrogen 15 per 
cent, when the body contains no stored proteins. But when the 
body is in good conclition — that is, containing a store of circulating 
protein in the organs of the body — the increase of urea is larger, 
because such proteins are consumed as a source of energy, but the 
muscle fibres are not broken down in a greater proportion by the 
work done by the body. 

Paton- made further observations on the effects of muscular

exertion on tlie excretion ot nitrogen. The total amount of work 
pcrfornied was estimated to be J7, j66 kilogramme-metres. The e.x- 
cretion of nitrogen was increased during and after the performance 
of work; and the increased metabolism of protein, indicated by the 
e.xcretion of nitrogen, accounted for 35 per cent, of the work done. 
It was evident, therefore, that in these expeiiments one-third of the 
energy expended in work was derived from the metabolism of protein, 
and two-thirds from non-niuogenous matter, which disproves 
Pfliiger's theory of the source of muscular energy. 

Finall}', the table ^ on pp. 114 and 115, fn^m the excellent reports 
of Atwater and his co-workers, will throw light upon the subject. 
Each experiment was made upon the body of the subject while in 
the respirator}^" calorimeter. The report shows the amount of food 
digested — that is, the total sum of the food available for building 
tissue and yielding energy. It also shows the available energy of 
the digested food — that is, the total heat of combustion minus the 
heat of combustion of the unoxidized materials in the faeces and 
urine — and the gain or loss of protein or fat to the body. 

The figures of the table show the average daily amount of available 
protein and energy supplied by the food, and the amounts actually 
used by the body when the subject was in a condition of rest — i.e., 
during a minimum of exercise — and also when he was engaged in 
decidedly active muscular work. The observers remark that there 
is no doubt that in many cases the body can be kept in nitrogen 
and carbon equilibrium with smaller amounts of nitrogen and 
energy than those actually used by any of the men in these ex- 
periments; but it is equally certain that in some cases the require- 
ments are much larger. The tentative standards for a daily diet 
proposed by a number of investigators have served a useful purpose, 
but they will have to be modified as the fundamental data become 
more exact and numerous. One principle in dietetics which has 
not received adequate recognition may be expressed by saying that 
the standard varies not only with the condition of activity, but also 
with the nutritive plane at which the body is to be maintained. Out of 
this arises an essential question: " What level of nutrition is most 
advantageous ?" The answer to this question is not an easy one. 
It must be sought in metabolism experiments and dietary studies, 
it is true; but it must also be sought in broader observations re- 
garding bodily and mental efhciency, general health, strength, and 
welfare. 

It is possible to answer this question with regard to protein. The 
physiological minimum for the requirement of protein is 34 grammes 
per diem; and it has been shown that with an ordinary diet of 
Voit's standard muscular exertion increases the metabolism of 
nitrogen i-i to 18 per cent., with an average of 15 per cent. From 
this point of view, therefore, an allowance of 10 to 15 grammes of 
protein for work to be performed would be sufficient, bringing the

Il6 THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

total allowance for inaintenance and work up to 44 or 50 granniies 
of protein daily. We are therefore bound to admit that Chittenden 
has proved by laboratory expermients that it is possible to maintain 
life, to prevent the tissues from destruction, and do a certain 
amount of work, upon an allowance of 50 to 57 granunes of protein — 
that is, one-half the aniount stated in standard diets— providing 
suthcient carbohydrates and fats are given to meet the expenditure 
of energy. 

Such a small allowance of protein is not desirable. It has not 
only been proved that half the standard allowance of protein will 
amply meet the demands of the body for nitrogen, but it has also 
been shown that anything more than the amount necessary for the 
formation and repair of muscular tissues is rapidly disintegrated 
and the urea moiety thrown out of the body; and it is claimed 
further that the additional amount which is usually consumed is 
harmful to the organism by throwing extra work upon the kidneys 
to excrete it, and that it may cause disease of those organs, and, 
in turn, gout, migraine, and kindred ailments. That an excess of 
nitrogen may be speedily eliminated is demonstrated by the fact 
that the amount of nitrogen metabolized is in proportion to the 
amount consumed. It has alread}' been shown that the amount 
of urea excreted with an ordinary mixed diet varies from 33 to 
^y grammes per diem ; but with extra protein the excretion of urea 
may rise to 50, 60, or even 100, grammes per diem. When no 
protein is consumed for several days the excretion of urea sinks to 
about 9 grammes, and with a diet poor in protein to 15 or 20 
grammes. The excretion of urea is a function of the kidneys, 
and it has not been proved that it is injurious for the kidneys 
to excrete the quantities named abo\^e; it may, however, be 
granted that if the function of the kidneys is defective there will 
be a retention of urea or other nitrogenous waste products in the 
body, and the organism wall suffer accordingly. In certain regions 
of the earth people live for many months upon flesh, fish, or fowl, 
and do not appear to suffer more than Pluropeans who live on a 
mixed diet. Carnivora live entirely on flesh, but there is no evidence 
that disease of the kidneys is produced by the exercise of the 
function of ehmination. Experiments upon animals have shown 
their need for protein food. ^Moreover, it has been demonstrated 
that when the amount of protein in their food sinks below the 
normal level, even when the calorie value of the food is maintained, 
they soon begin to suffer from digestive disturbances, loss of 
appetite, vomiting, incomplete absorption of the food, and they 
become apathetic and die in a few months. As an example of such 
experiments, Munk of Berlin ^ made a series of observations on 
the effects of a loic protei)i diet with an abundance of energy-pro- 
ducing food in dogs. He found that, although the food was sufficient 
to supply 1-6 grammes of protein per kilo of body- weight and an 
abundance of fat and carbohydrates, all the animals became weak,

became poorer, the assimilation of fat beinf< the most disturbed, 
that of protein less, and that of carbohydrates being the least 
disturbed of all. It might be thought that the failure of assimila- 
tion was due to defective secretion of the digestive juices, but there 
was no evidence of this. At any rate, the animals did not recover 
their nitrogenous and nutritional equilibrium until their ration 
included 2-9 grammes of protein per kilo of body- weight, the fuel 
value remaining the same. 

If the animals kept on a low protein diet for some time are given 
skim milk, beans, or other nitrogenous food, a distinct improvement 
in their condition occurs, if the former experiment has not been 
continued too long. Bacon from pigs fed on a low protein diet is 
of a poor quality. The milk of cows fed on a deficiency of protein 
is poor in fat; the cattle become thin, their coats harsh, and they 
generally look ill-fed. The absolute and relative amount of protein 
in the milk is not proportionalto the protein in the food, but the 
quantitj' of fat in the milk is proportional to the protein in the 
food. 

These experiments upon the lower animals confirm the observa- 
tions on mankind — viz., that, although it is possible for individuals 
to live and maintain their health, and work for months together, 
upon a low protein diet, a continuance of a low protein diet for a 
long period is harmful, vitality is weakened, immunity to disease 
is lessened, the body has less activity and endurance; and, more- 
over, it does not appear to be proved that such a diet is 
advantageous to the individual. 

Muscular work involves the expenditure of energy, and to meet 
an increased demand for energy more fuel must be consumed. It 
has been shown that, for the supply of energy, protein, fat, and 
carbohydrate, can replace one another in a definite proportion. 
It has likewise been shown that the increased excretion of nitrogen 
during and after the performance of work is not in proportion to 
the work done, and, in fact, the energy spent in the performance of 
work is chiefly derived from non-nitrogenous food. It appears 
therefore that, when extra work has to be performed, it is sufficient 
to increase the allowance of fat and carbohydrate alone. But this 
point cannot be regarded as settled beyond dispute; and it has 
been the custom for ages past to increase the total food, protein 
included, in proportion to the extra work to be done. As regards 
endurance, it is generally accepted as a fact that men who eat plenty 
of meat are more powerful and have greater staying power or 
endurance than those who consume little meat. The experience 
of ages may be called in support of this fact. Animals which 
consume the most protein are the most energetic. The lion or 
tiger is more fierce than the bear or deer. Horses fed on beans or 
oats have more spirit and endurance than those fed on hay or 
grass, and those fed on good hay (i.e., containing more seeds) than 



Ii8 THE AMOUNT OF FOOD RFOUTRFD 

those fed on poor hay. It is true that feats of eiichirance can be 
performed on a vegetarian diet ; but this is not necessarily deficient 
in protein. It may be reasonably asked, Does it matter whether 
the protein is taken in the form of animal or vegetable food ? All 
proteins consist of amino-acids; they originate in the vegetable 
kingdom, and many of the amino-acids of animal proteins are 
precisely the same as those in vegetable proteins; and therefore it 
would appear a priori that there can be little difference in their 
value upon the organism. But it is remarkable how deficient in 
flavouring agents are the most valuable protein foods of the vege- 
table kingdom, and how the existence of these bodies in meat, 
fowl, and fish, adds to their palatability. It is undoubted that 
some of these bodies {meat bases), es})ecially creatin, act as stimulants 
to nervous and muscular activity; and herein probably exists one 
of the great differences between animal and vegetable protein 
foods. The supposition that the association of unorganized amino- 
acids with organized proteins renders them of greater value to 
the body seems to be borne out by experience. Potatoes, for 
instance, contain a comparatively large proportion of amino-acids 
{e.g., asparagin) to the organized protein; bread, on the other hand, 
contains a much smaller amount of free amino-acids. It has been 
shown that asparagin is a good protein-sparer. That it is a stimu- 
lant to cell activity is readily shown by comparing two samples of 
yeast, one of which is used alone, and the other mixed with a solu- 
tion of asparagin. It may be from this association that the sup- 
posed superiority of potato-protein over bread-protein arises. 
Rubner, at the International Congress of Hygiene in Berlin, 1907, 
stated that all forms of protein are not of equal value: 37 grammes 
of protein of potato is equal to 81 grammes of protein of bread, but 
meat-protein is superior to either of them. 

In concluding this subject one has to inquire — 

1. Is there sufilicient evidence to show that the inuscle can work 
as efficiently when the l^nnph surrounding its fibres is practically 
free from the products of protein digestion and assimilation as when 
some of its oxidizable particles are derived from protein ? 

2. Is the evidence derived from laboratory experiments conclusive 
as to the desirability of reducing the consumption of protein ? 

3. Is there any conclusive evidence that the consumption of the 
ordinary amount of protein is injurious to the organism ? 

The evidence that the amount of protein prescribed by the 
standard diets is injurious to the organism is not conclusive. On 
the other hand, there is ample evidence of the bad effects of a long- 
continued diet of low protein value among the poor who are unable 
to purchase meat, fish, eggs, and milk, in amounts to supply some- 
thing near the standard diets. Rubner agrees that from the 
laboratory standpoint an average consumption of 57 grammes of 
protein daily would suffice to maintain an adult weighing 70 kilos 
in nutritive equilibrium and working capacity. But he considers 
a distinction should be made between the results of laboratory 



Tin: Ph'Ori.fX OPTIMl'M tio 

experiments and rules applicabk- to the masses of mankind; he 
concludes that a workint,' man recjuircs an average of 131 grammes 
of protein, 118 grannnes being the minimum. 

Cohnheim considers Chittenden's experiments do not prove that 
men eat too much protein; they only prove that they can live for 
a time upon a smaller amount of protein than usual. He considers 
that most men could not continue to live upon 50 or 60 grammes of 
protein and keep in good health. He agrees with Caspari and 
J.oevvy that a healthy full-grown man requires at least 80 grammes 
of protein daily; and that is a considerable reduction from the 
standard diet. Folin says that as Chittenden's experiments show 
what is the protein minimum, so the so-called "dietary standards " 
show that the customary or average protein consumption among 
the most successful nations represents the necessary amount, or 
optimum, of protein consumption; but it seemed to him that the 
protein optimum lay somewhere between these two points. 
Hutchison accepts Chittenden's results as showing what men 
can live upon ; but he believes there would be danger in their 
general application ; an excess of protein may make for greater 
immunity to disease. In deciding tlie question of protein require- 
ment, he compares the food of an adult with that of a nursing infant. 
An infant of six months consumes milk containing 14 granmies of 
protein and 578 calories daily; the average energy value of the 
adult is 3,000 calories, and in the same proportion the standard 
of protein for the latter should be 74 grammes, the growth in the 
child being set off against wear and tear in the adult. He says, 
liowever, it should be borne in mind that a diet rich in protein 
increases the power of resistance to infectious diseases, especially 
tuberculosis, and there may be a danger in having no margin of 
circulating protein to draw upon. The protein optimum may vary 
in different individuals and under different circumstances, but it 
is probable that the amount of protein requisite for efficient health 
is somewhat below the standards hitherto accepted. Halliburton 
agrees with the results of Chittenden's experiments in metabolism, 
but considers there is a danger in living too near the minimum of 
the poor, who nolens volens have to live on a diet ver\- much like 
Chittenden's. It is necessary to bear in mind the double part 
played by protein in metabolism — viz., as a source of energy and 
a repairer of tissues. In performing the former function the nitrog- 
enous portion is rapidly got rid of as urea. But as a flesh-former 
it is possible that certain members of the amino-acid group in the 
protein molecule might be especially necessary for protein synthesis 
in the body, and it is for these bodies, occurring in small amount, 
that a larger protein intake is necessary than the apparent 
minimum. 

Haldane considers the basis of Atwater's standards for the energy' 
value of food to be absolutely sound, and the records of cases in 
which men were placed on a restricted diet showed not only that 
they lost weight, but the working capacity and resistance to epidemic 



T20 Tin: AMOUNT OF FOOD RF.OUJRFD 

and otluT diseases was greatly diminished. He emphasizes strongly 
tlie diminished resistance to infection. This factor is of enormous 
practical importance when the food-supply of large numbers of 
persons becomes for any reason restricted. \\'ith regard to protein 
food in particular, he considers the evidence that half the usual 
amount consumed by Europeans would suflice is not clear, and the 
experiments of Chittenden on this point do not possess much 
weight. Alexander Haig found that his patients could not go for 
long periods on less than 90 or 95 grammes of protein daily without 
breaking down; some did not break down for eighteen months, but 
they became weak and anaemic. 

Kellog subscribes to the doctrine that no protein is stored in the 
system, and considers that all protein above Go or 70 grammes 
daily is broken down in the alimentary canal by bacteria into 
toxins such as indol, skatol, phenol, leucin, tyrosin, etc., and cause 
auto-intoxication. 

The conclusion is that, while a minimum of protein is essential 
to the organism, a greater proportion is advantageous by acting 
as a stimulant to metabolism and as a ready source of energy; that 
people are better for the consumption of protein in quantities 
greater than Chittenden's standard, and possess greater resistance 
to disease, probably because the organism is stimulated to manu- 
facture antibodies. On the other hand, the well-known experience 
of ages has shown that the poor who live on a low protein diet are 
the most liable to various diseases. It is difficult to decide on a 
fixed quantity which should be called the optimum of protein ; it 
is probably influenced by the personal equation in each case. It 
maj', however, be urged that during the period of growth and up 
to middle age the optimiim for protein is higher than from middle 
age onwards. It is impossible to eliminate from the question the 
factors of race, climate, and custom, and, although it is certain 
that three meat meals a daj- are unnecessary', and even undesirable 
in many cases, it cannot be gainsaid that the meat-eater has greater 
stamina and energy than the individual whose diet is poor in 
protein. The question, therefore, of protein rests upon whether 
it is desirable that the stored proteins of the body shall be main- 
tained at a high level or at a low level. Hence it must be stated 
that a high le\-cl is better for some people and a lower level for 
others. It is well known than the metabolic processes are feebler 
in some persons than others. In early life the metabolic processes 
are very active, the eliminatory organs are healthy, and therefore 
an}^ amount of protein above the physiological requirement which 
may be consumed is speedily utilized, being oxidized or stored 
in the tissues as muscle or fat. So long as the alimentary organs 
are capable of digesting and assimilating protein, and the liver and 
kidneys are capable of transforming the nitrogenous portion to 
urea and excreting it, protein food is not injurious to the body. 
But when middle life is reached the metabolic processes become 
less active, and protein, if taken in quantities above the physiological 



THR nrmffM rs vaujabli: 121 

ri'(iuiriiiuMit, tcntls to an accumulation of fat in the tissues; and 
the urea moiety is not so easily excreted because the Uver is less 
efficient and the excretory power of the kidneys may fail. It is 
then that care needs to be exercised, that the consumption of 
protein needs to be kept down, that the optimum sinks to a lower 
level than in youth and early adult life. The optimum of former 
days may ncnv become an excess. The power of digestion may also 
fail, especially if, from the consumption of alcohol or other causes, 
the mucosa of the alimentary canal is in a condition of chronic 
catarrh, and bacteria may flourish and produce toxins by the 
decomposition of protein, the absorption of which sets up arterio- 
sclerosis, chronic nephritis, chronic disease of the liver, and other 
diseases which disturb the normal course of protein metabolism. 

The Amount of Fat and Carbohydrate required. — These points 
cannot very well be separated from the former, and have already 
received consideration when dealing with the question of energy, 
and again when discussing the amount of protein required. Bene- 
dict, in his refutation of Chittenden's advocacy of a diminution of 
protein, says: " Food should be ingested in just the proper amount 
to repair the waste of the body; to furnish it with the energy it 
needs for work and warmth; to maintain it in vigour; and, in the 
case of immature animals, to provide the proper excess for normal 
growth, in order to be of the most advantage to the body." He 
gives the follo^ving figures as representing the average of very many 
dietaries:

The amount of carbohydrate and fat required will depend to 
some extent upon the quantity of protein consumed. As we have 
already seen, Voit's standard for protein is 17, Maurel's 1-5, Chit- 
tenden's 07 to o-g, gramme per kilo of body-weight ; and therefore 
the amount of protein varies from 118 grammes allowed by Voit 
down to 57 grammes by Chittenden, yielding from 484 to 234 
calories, or units of heat. Benedict, however, remarks that, " diet- 
ary studies all over the world show that in communities where 
productive power, enterprise, and civilization, are at their highest, 
man has instinctively and independently selected liberal rather 
than small quantities of protein." Assuming, then, that 450 to 



122 THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

480 calories are derived from j^rotein, there remain 2,000 calories 
or more to be derived from non-nitrogenous sources. 

It is almost impossible for persons in ordinary health and under 
ordinary circumstances to live continuously without carbohydrate. 
Persons can live, of course, upon animal food for months together. 
But it is usually found, when the diet has been deficient in carbo- 
hydrate for a long time, that a rendition of acetona^mia occurs, 
and acetone and diacetic acid are excreted in the urine. This 
arises from the call which Nature makes upon the fatty tissues to 
supply the energy for working the machinery and yielding heat. 
Under certain circumstances, such as living an out-of-door life 
combined with great activity, the metabolism of fat is complete, 
whatever demand is made upon the organism. But if the average 
European, living the ordinary life of his country, consumes only 
animal food, the metabolism of fat may be incomplete owing to 
deficient oxidation. Hence the bodies arising from incomplete 
oxidation of fat produce acetoucemia, acetonuria, etc. Such a 
condition occurs in many infants who are fed with milk diet which 
is defective in carbohydrate, and in diabetics kept upon a strict 
dietary for a length of time. The latter class of people teach us 
how little carbohydrate the adult organism can do with. The 
amount of carbohydrate which will prevent acetonuria varies in 
individual cases, but it has been found that as little as 70 grammes 
per diem is sufficient in the majority of cases. It may therefore be 
taken that the minimum amount of carbohydrate which may safely 
be consumed b\' a person of average weight — i.e., 154 pounds 
(70 kilos) — is 70 grammes, or i gramme per kilo of body- weight, 
whereas the amount prescribed in the standard dietaries varies 
from 4 to 6 grammes per kilo for a man doing a moderate amount 
of work. For various reasons the amount given in standard 
dietaries may be considered to be the optimum, but the proportion 
required must vary as the proportion of fat consumed and the 
work done. Whatever deficiency may occur in the calorific value 
of the food owing to a deprivation of a part of the carbohydrate 
must be made good by fat, or protein and fat. It is considered 
that the maximimi for protein is 190 grammes. It has also been 
showTi that an excess of fat will not be tolerated for a very long 
time, that its metabolism is apt to become defective, and even its 
assimilation may be defective. When considering the digestibihty 
of foods, it was shown that if a very large amount of fat is con- 
sumed alargerpercentage will reappear in the faeces. But as much 
as 240 grammes (8 ounces) of butter have been consumed with a 
reappearance of only 27 per cent, in the faeces; whereas the con- 
sumption of 100 to 145 grammes of bacon or other fat meat was 
followed by the reappearance of 13 to 17 per cent, in the faeces. 
Respecting the amount of fat which can be completely oxidized in 
the body in a state of health we have little available information. 
But it is evident that when hard work is being performed a large 
amount can be disposed of, as much as 6 to 9 ounces of butter

Tills is an advantage in some respects, as the heat-value of fat is 
two and a quarter times as much as that of carbohydrate or protein, 
and therefore a considerable number of calories can be taken in the 
form of butter, dripping, bacon, or fat meat. 

As to whether fat and carbohydrate are both necessary, a dis- 
cussion on other matters is involved. As a rule children do not 
thrive whose food is deficient in fat ; adults arc prone to tuberculosis 
and nervous diseases when the fat in their body is deficient. Fat, 
however, may actually be formed in the body from the fatty-moiet\- 
of proteins or from carbohydrates, and therefore the surplus fat 
of the body may be fat merely stored up from the food. Instances 
of the formation of fat from protein occur in carnivorous animals, 
in the formation of adipocere, in the ripening of cheese, and in the 
secretion of milk. The formation of fat from carbohydrates was 
first investigated in pigs by I.awes and Gilbert ; but Rubner, Meissl, 
and others, have made observations thereon. One of the most 
important instances of the origin of fat from carbohydrates occurs 
in the formation of beeswax. The formation of fat from carbo- 
hydrates occurs probably in all animals, although its explanation 
on chemical grounds is considered difficult. In some experiments 
upon oxen at the Mockern Experiment Station from 1882 to 1890,1 
it was found that the smallest ration which will maintain a steer 
in equilibrium must furnish 07 kilo of digestible protein and 
()•/ kilos of digestible nitrogen-free substance per 1,000 kilos of 
body- weight daily; that any excess over that amount results in 
the formation of fat ; that it makes no difference whether the excess 
consists of nitrogenous or non-nitrogenous matter; but the con- 
clusion was arrived at that fat is produced from carbohydrates, 
and I kilo (2), pounds) of starch produced an average of 0-2 kilo 
(7 ounces) of fat. In fact, the observation showed that the amount 
of fat formed from carbohydrate was seven or eight times as much 
as that introduced into the body pre-formed or derived from protein. 
It may therefore be conchided that a considerable proportion of 
fat accumulated in the human body is derived from carbohydrates. 

How is Fat used in the Body ? — Chaveau- considers that fats are 
chiefly transformed into carbohydrates, and this view is supported 
by observations on hibernating animals, and we cannot otherwise 
interpret the fixation of oxygen during the winter sleep of such 
animals with the gradual disappearance of fat and the reconstruc- 
tion of glycogen and glucose. But there is nothing which warrants 
the conclusion that this process occurs only in hibernating animals: 
on the contrary, he considers it to be a n'o^/^/rtr physiological process. 
The potential directly devoted to the physiological work of the 
muscles is always a carbohydrate, which is borrowed from the 
reserves of glycogen in the organism, or derived by transfonnation 
of fat immediately absorbed in the food or furnished by the fatty

reservoirs of the organism. The lattir is the soiiree ami nat\irc 
of the potential directly utilized in muscular work by a man in a 
state of inanition. The immediate destination of fat is the main- 
tenance of the potential of the organism. If the reserve of carbo- 
hydrates is impoverished, as in a state of inanition, the alimentary 
fats may at once be used; but if other^vi?e, they go to the reservoirs 
of adipose tissue, whert^ the fatty principles are stored up for future 
use, and whence they are drawn as required. The evidence supplied 
by the respiratory changes shows that fat never directly constitutes 
the potential utilized by the muscles, even in a state of inanition. 
Tt is always in the fonn of a carbohydrate that the energetic potential 
is supplied to muscular activity. The work of the muscles tends 
to exhaustion of the reservoirs of glycogen and glucose; but, in 
spite of abstinence from food, these reservoirs tend to replenish 
themselves in proportion to their consumption. 

Fat versus Carbohydrate as a Source of Muscular Energy.— 
Calorimetric observations have shown that the caloric \-alue of fat 
and carbohydrate have a definite ratio = 2j : i. But other observa- 
tions^ have shown that as sources of muscular energy carbohydrates 
have a slightly superior value to an isodynamic quantity of fat 
as a part of a ration for muscular work. While, however, calorie 
for calorie, the carbohydrates are slightly superior to fats as a 
source of muscular energy, the difference observed is so small as 
to be due to personal peculiarities rather than any inherent differ- 
ence in the capacity of the materials to 3'ield energy for muscular 
work. The difference, such as it is, probably arises from the 
chemical composition or molecular constitution of the molecules. 
The hydrogen in the carbohydrate molecule is already fully oxidized, 
and therefore only the carbon is available for oxidation. In the fats, 
on the other hand, neither the carbon nor the hydrogen are fully 
oxidized, whence arises the superior calorific value of fat over 
carbohydrates. But fats are not so quickly available for use by 
the muscles, because they have to be transformed into carbohydrate. 
On the other hand, carbohj^drates are readily available. Starch 
is quickly transformed into sugar, and sugars into glycogen and 
glucose. The great value, for instance, of cane-sugar as a source 
of muscular energy has been shown by many observers. Petten- 
kofer framed the dictum that good work needs a muscular system 
developed by the aid of a nitrogenous diet and supplied by a circu- 
lation enriched with sugar. The sugar need not be consumed as 
cane-sugar, but merely as digestible carbohydrate. However, the 
rapidity with which cane-sugar is assimilated gives it an advantage 
over starch and other non-saccharine carboh3-drates during periods 
of exhausting labour, and it is much used by men who have heavy 
work to do, such as harvest-men, lumber-men, athletes, etc. Ex- 
periments made by Mosso's ergograph showed that less muscular 
deterioration occurred in men who worked on a diet containing a 
large proportion of sugar; that when muscles were fatigued and

iiicapablf ol lurtlK-r work, a meal rich ia sugar quickly rendered 
them lit again. Thus, Schumberg found that when muscles had 
been exhausted by work, sugar restored the power of the tired 
muscles in thirty-five to forty minutes, so that results obtained 
by the ergograph were scarcely cUstinguishable from those obtained 
before they had become exhausted. These results are in accordance 
with common usage and experience. When men have extra work 
to do, they do not as a rule greatly increase the amount of fat in 
their diet, except in sufficient proportion to aid in the consumption 
of bread, but the majority of them prefer to increase the carbo- 
hydrate. 

Carbohydrate and Fat versus Protein as a Source o£ Muscular 
Energy. — Muscle itself atlords no evidence of an increased metabo- 
lism of nitrogen w'ithin its elements during exercise, but there is a 
clear proof of an increased oxidation of non-nitrogenous materials 
leading to an increased excretion of COg, etc. The evidence con- 
cerning the excretion of urea during and after exertion is some- 
what confhcting. In many observations no marked change could be 
observed; in others there was a slight decrease of urea excreted on 
the da}'s when work was done, and a decided increase on the days 
following work; and in other cases there was a marked increase of 
urea when severe labour was performed, but the increase was not 
proportionate to the work done. On an ordinary diet the increase 
due to work is not more than 9 or 10 per cent. On the other hand, 
the production of COg is at once and largely increased by muscular 
labour. The following observations were made in one experiment:

It is obvious, therefore, that a man doing even moderate muscular 
work needs a larger supply of energy-producing food than a man 
at rest or following a sedentary occupation ; it is also obvious that 
carbohydrates and fats are the chief source of the energy. It has 
previously been shown that there is no basis for the assumption 
that protein is the sole source of muscular energy. The general 
belief of physiologists is that all the nutrients of food, proteins, 
fats, and carbohydrates, supply nmscular energy in proportion to 
their calorie value. The carbon metabolism is principally aug- 
mented by muscular work, and this suggests that extra food for 
extra work should consist exclusively of carbon compounds. 
Atwatcr, ' after making very many observations, arrived at these 
conclusions: (i) That a considerable amount of energy for muscular

126 THE AMOUM Ol- hOOD REQUIRED 

work luu^l conn.' Iruin substances oilier than protein; (2) it is in 
tlie highest degree probable tliat the largest pari of the energy 
comes Ironi carbohydrates and fat ; (j) that these observations leave 
no basis for the assumption that proteins are the sole source of 
muscular energy; and (4) it is also probable that carbohjdrates are 
nn)re readil}- and directly available for the supply of the potential 
in the muscles. This consideration points to the conclusion that 
any increase of energy demanded for work should be supplied b}' 
an increase of carbohydrates rather than fat or protein. " But 
in choosing a diet for umscular labour," Foster^ says: " We must 
ha\ e in view the condition not only of the muscle, but of the whole 
organism. The power of doing work depends not on muscle alone, 
but on the heart, hmgs, nervous system, indeed the whole body. 
Fatigue is more a nervous than a muscular condition, and is, partly 
at least, due to the accumulation of waste products, and not merely 
to the exhaustion of available energy. These considerations, 
therefore, would tend to the conclusion that what is good for the 
organism in a state of rest is good for it in hard work, and that 
the diet normal for the former condition is correct for the latter, 
no change in the ratio or composition being needed, but a total 
increase in proportion to the work to be done." A man doing a 
moderate amount of work will eliminate from his body from 250 
to 280 grammes of carbon per diem, or during active muscular work 
3jO to J50 grammes of carbon daily. During the same time he will 
also eliminate about 15 to 19 grammes of nitrogen. The ratio of 
carbon to nitrogen in the food therefore should be about i6-6 to i. 
Xow, the proportion of carbon and nitrogen in protein averages 
ys to I. Hence the diet of a person living wholly on protein 
would be incorrectly balanced: if he consumed just enough protein 
to supply the nitrogen demanded by the bod}', the carbon would be 
deficient; if, on the other hand, he consumed enough to supply the 
carbon, there would be a great excess of nitrogen. To provide the 
250 grammes of carbon would necessitate the consumption of 
500 grammes of protein, obtainable from 5 to 6 pounds of beef. 
This quantit}' of beef would contain much more nitrogen than was 
lost by the body during a day's work, and probably more than the 
kidneys could excrete. A purel}- protein or lean meat diet, although 
applicable in certain cases for a short time, is impossible for con- 
tinued usage; it would not maintain the bod}' in health over a long 
period, and as a rule the body would waste rapidly (see Obesity). 
The body requires organic phosphorus and sulphur as well as 
nitrogen, and their absence renders a carbohydrate or fatty diet 
equally impossible for more than a few days. Therefore the correct 
principle for framing dietaries is to keep the quantity of protein 
at such a level as will replace the quantity of nitrogen lost daily, 
and to supplement this by non-nitrogenous foods to bring up the 
dietary to the proper standard required to supply heat and energy. 
As to whether both fat and carbohydrate are essential involves

other puinls, such as the cuinpura,liv(j digcstibihty, bulk, and calorie 
value. It has been shown that some fat in the diet is essential 
to the continuance of good health. It has also been shown that 
fat can be formed in the body from carbohydrate; but it should be 
remembered that all persons do not appear to possess this faculty 
in an equal degree. As a matter of fact, it has been found that 
animals thri\e best when their carbon is derived from both fat 
and carbohytlrate, thus confirming the experience of ages that the 
best food either for the worker or non-worker is a mixture of proteins, 
carbohydrates, and fat. Respecting the quantities of these sub- 
stances recjuircd, I'oster ^ says: "To put down a single column of 
figures as the normal diet would be to affect a vain and delusive 
accuracy." The following diets show how authorities vary: 




If we consider the physiological requirement of protein to be that 
previously fixed, then it must be allowed that Ranke's diet is in 
that respect nearer to the normal than Cornet's; and if the cost is 
of no moment, the substitution of fat for carbohydrate by Ranke 
is again desirable, and therefore Ranke's diet is more satisfactory 
than Cornet's. It is true that the calorie value of the former diet 
is low, having been arranged for a professional man, and would not 
be sufficient for a man doing hard work. Ranke's diet would allow 
a moderate consumption of meat; Cornet's diet a large consumption 
of bread and a moderate consmiiption of meat. Statistical diets, 
arranged from the amount of food usually consumed by people, 
are not scientifically arranged; instinct is not an unerring guide, 
and the choice of food depends upon other circumstances than the 
physiological value and composition of the food. 

Some examples of food actually used in English families, the 
army, navy, mercantile marine, workhouses, prisons, etc., will 
now be given.

The entire dietary consumed in the week ending February i8, 
1911, by a family of eleven persons, including servants, after 
allowing 10 per cent, for waste, gave per person an average of 
144 grammes (5 ounces) of protein, 99 grammes (3^ ounces) of fat, 
and 243 grammes (8| ounces) of carbohydrate, or 2,517 calories 
per day, at a cost of about twelve shillings each per week. In this 
dietary' the protein is high, not because the meat and fish are 
excessive, but by reason of the eggs, milk, etc., used in the prepara- 
tion of many of the sweets. 



FAMILY DU'.TATUr.S 



I2Q 



The following is the amount of provisions actually used in a 
working-class family in the week ending January 2 r, 1911: Meat, 
15 pounds; liver, i pound; bacon, 5 pounds; salmon (canned), 

2 pounds; codfish, 2 pounds; milk, 20 pints; cheese, i i)ound; butter, 
4 pounds; lard, i pound; sugar, 8 pounds; bread, 48 pounds; cake, 

3 pounds; eggs, 24; flour, 7 pounds; potatoes, 20 pounds; dried 
peas, 2 pounds; cabbage and Brussels sprouts, 14 pounds; onions, 

4 pounds; rolled oats, 2 pounds; apples,' 6 pounds; tomatoes 
3 pounds; jam, 4 pounds; dried currants (Zante), i pound; tea, 
J pound; cocoa, f pound. This dietary, after allowing 10 per cent, 
for waste, provides an average of 103 grammes of protein, 97 grammes 
of fat, and 360 grammes of carbohydrates, per day for each person. 
But the family consisted of eight persons, and the food consumed 
daily by them was estimated to contain the following amounts:

According to the mother's statement, the two girls ate 2 pounds of 
bread each per day, one of the young men and the boy ate from 
2 to 3 pounds of bread per day. The average cost was 6s. 5d., or 
1-55 dollars, a week per person. 

The following is the list of food consumed by another working- 
class family in the week ending February 25, 1911: 6 pounds of 
beef, 5 pounds of mutton, i pound of steak, i pound of stewing 
beef, I pound of beef sausages, 50 eggs, 25 pounds of potatoes, 
I pound of dried peas. 3 pounds of cake, 2 pounds of cheese, 6 pounds 
of bacon, 3 pounds of codfish, i tin of salmon, 3 pounds of lard, 
3^ pounds of butter, 56 pounds of bread, 4 pounds of flour, 18 pints 
of milk, 6 pounds of sugar, i pound of rice, li pounds of tomatoes, 
I pound of tea, \ pound of cocoa, condiments, green vegetables, 
a little fruit, custard powders, tablets for jelly, etc. The dietary, 
after allowing 10 per cent, for waste, provided 100 grammes of 
protein, 11 1 grammes of fat, and 390 grammes of carbohydrate, 
per day for each person, at a cost of 6s. iid. per head per week. 
The family consisted of five men and two women. The consump- 
tion of the food was probably as follows: 

Per man: Protein 105, fat 115, carbohydrate 430 grammes. 
Per woman: ,, 86, ,, 98, ,, 386 

In an inquiry by the British Board of Trade (1908) into the 
conditions of life among the working classes, it was found, as was

The emiount spent on bread, meat, and milk, varied with the 
income. The average amount spent on meat and fish was 6s. 4|d., 
and on milk is. 3^d., per week per family; and the amount of bread 
and fiour consumed averaged 32 pounds, but it varied from 28 to- 
38 pounds. When the income was below 25s. per week, the 
expenditure on bread and flour was 21 per cent, of the total; when 
the income was between 35s. and 40s. per week, the amount spent 
on bread and fiour was 15 per cent, of the total expenditure; while 
the amount spent on meat and fish increased proportionately. 
Oatmeal is largely used by the Scotch working classes, but hardly 
at all by the same classes in England. Foreign and colonial meat 
is much used by these classes in England, but to a far less extent 
in Scotland.

Considerable economy arises from the consumption of the cheaper 
joints of meat , home-made bread, and skim milk indicated herein ; also 
by the substitution of dripping for butter and lard. In many dietaries 
for working-class families economy is practised by the use of foreign 
meat. It may be stated here that the use of foreign and colonial 
meat receives the approbation of all men who have considered 
the dietaries of the poor. Prior to the introduction of these foods, 
fresh meat was rarely seen on the tables of the poor more than 
once a week; but the importation of chilled beef and mutton has 
brought these valuable sources of protein within the reach and 
purchasing power of nearly everybody. A sufficient suppl}^ of 
proteins can be obtained from an equally economical vegetarian 
diet; but it appears that the inhabitants of Great Britain as a rule 
prefer that their diet should contain some animal food, which is 
more costly. The 'compilers of the York Chart point out that 
the cheaper cuts of beef and mutton, 'ccJien skiced, are as nourishing 
as steaks and chops, which are far more expensive ; that frying is 
the most expensive mode of preparing meat; that beef dripping is 
more appetizing than bad butter; that oatmeal is as nourishing as 
the fancy breakfast foods, although it requires longer cooking; 
that peas and beans have an especial value, but are only digestible 
when they have been soaked and well cooked. After making an 
investigation into the dietaries of the working classes, Noel Paton 
and Crawford Dunlop reported as follows: 



132 THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

" Bread forms tlio basis of all diets. It provides an average of 
one-third of the total energy and one-third of the total protein 
consumed. It is a cheap food. For providing energy we find only 
oatmeal and sugar are cheaper; for providing protein we find 
only oatmeal and peas are cheaper. 

"Sugar is one of the most important foodstuffs of the poor. 
It is solelv an energv provider, but for this purpose it is the cheapest 
of all. 

" Butter, margarine, dripping, and suet, are also cheap as a 
source of energy. They rank tliird as a source of energy, only sugar 
being cheaper. 

" Potato is a more expensive food than bread; both as energy 
and protein provider it is twice as dear, but its antiscorbutic proper- 
ties justifies its use in dietaries. 

" Oatmeal costs less than bread as a source of both protein and 
energy. Peas are cheaper than oatmeal as a protein provider; 
sugar is cheaper as an energy provider; but the latter contains no 
protein. As a food providing cheap energy and having a good 
protein value, oatmeal is the best of the entire list. 

" Beef is an expensive source of nourishment. Its protein is 
four times as dear and its energy nine times as dear as that of bread. 
Ham is cheaper than beef, both as energy and protein provider, and 
so are sausages and mutton. 

" Fresh fish is cheap as protein provider, but dear as energy 
provider. Smoked fish or dried fish is expensive both as energy 
and protein provider. 

" Cheese is a cheap source of protein and energy. 

" Eggs are expensive both as energy and protein providers. Their 
large use may be attributed to the small amount of trouble required 
in cooking them. 

" Milk is also comparatively expensive. As a source of energy 
it is five times, and as a source of protein three times, as dear as 
bread; but it is essential in the diet of small children. . . . 

" Without an adequate supply of food, growth and development 
of the body are impossible, the working capacity of the individual 
is reduced, and a predisposition to disease is induced. . . . The 
large use of food which provides energy, but not protein, is one 
reason why the dietaries of the poor are so badly balanced; they 
contain but little protein comparatively to their energy. ... A 
dietary consisting of tea and bread-and-butter is faulty; it can be 
improved by the free use of meat and other animal foods, but these 
are expensive. It can also be improved by the free use of oatmeal 
and milk, or by peas, beans, or lentils, which add little to the cost, 
but require much more care in the cooking. A daily diet containing 
meat need not cost more than sevenpence per person ; but when the 
meat is replaced by peas and beans, or oatmeal and milk, it need 
not cost more than fourpence." 

Konig also showed that a vegetarian dietary is more economical 
than mixed diet, and made the following calculation : lOO grammes

of protein from the animal kingdom cost 65 pence, and 100 grammes 
of animal fat 20 pence; from the vegetable kingdom, 100 grammes of 
protein cost 13 pence, 100 grammes (jf fat 4^ pence, and 100 grammes 
of carboliydrate 2\ pence. A consideration of the vegetarian

The food of soldiers has been considered in connection with 
protein (p. 103). 

The peace ration of the British soldier is somewhat less than the 
French, but more than the German, peace ration. The British 
soldier receives free % pound of meat and i pound of bread daily, 
which form the basis of his dietar}'. This is supplemented by a 
grocery ration, for which threepence to fourpencc a day is stopped 



ARMY 1)II:TARII:S 



135 



out ul tlic nicn'b wages for the mess. The articles usually provided 
for it are — ^ pound of bread, J pound of fresh vegetables, and 
I pound of potatoes, with enough sugar, tea, coffee, and milk for 
the morning and evening meals, flour, rice or oatmeal, and fruit, 
about I ounce of butter daily, and condiments such as salt, pepper, 
and mustard, for dinner. The meat includes bone, which averages 
20 per cent., so that the man gets 9-6 ounces of meat. It has been 
complained by men that the bone often exceeds 20 per cent., and 
that the men only get about 7 ounces of meat. This is probably 
accidental; at any rate, the bone should not exceed 20 per cent. 
The grocery ration varies in different regiments and corps. The 
hours of meals are — Breakfast, 7'3o; dinner, 12-30; and tea at 4-30. 
The dietary is supplemented by articles purchased by the soldier 
for his supper, and the pay of the soldier is considered to be suffi- 
cient to allow of this being done without hardship. The system 
of buying their own supper is preferred by the men; it allows each 
man to choose his own food, thereby preventing monotony; and 
experience has shown that the plan works smoothly. The recruit, 
usually a growing youtli, requires more food than the fully developed 
adult, and a messing allowance of 3d. a day is given them, which 
is commonly spent in the purchase of cakes and other sweets. 

The dietar}^ fixed for a large body of men must necessarily have 
a high standard for its fixed calorie value, because the needs of the 
men are not all on the same level, and insufficiency, as well as waste, 
has to be guarded against. The diet has to be varied as much as 
possible, experience having shown that an unvaried diet becomes 
distasteful, and may result in serious consequences as regards 
health and liability to disease. At present the balance of opinion 
is against cutting down the allowance of protein below 125 grammes 
(4^ ounces) a day, which is included in the above dietary. The 
most striking deficiency in the dietary is in the class of fatt}^ foods. 
The free ration contains only i ounce of butter, and the supple- 
mentary ration about ^ ounce to i ounce more, making a total, 
with fat in meat, of about 75 grammes (2J ounces) of fat. This 
could be improved by giving 2 ounces of cheese and 2 ounces of 
bacon on alternate days, or by increasing the allowance of butter. 
The bread is not always wholly consumed ; about J pound of the 
free allowance is often wasted. There would certainly be less 
waste of bread if there were a greater provision of fat to eat with it. 
Foreign armies all receive poor fat rations, that of Russia containing 
only zy grammes, the Germans 58, the French 72, in the service 
ration. The United States alone provides 100 grammes of fat 
in the ordinary peace ration. The table on p. 136 shows how the 
items of the ration are varied from day to day. 

The form in which food is supplied is of no small importance. 
It must be pleasant to the taste and smell. In ordinary cooking 
the food is spiced with salt, pepper, and other condiments, which 
have a high dietetic value when not used to excess. There have 
been complaints from the occupants that the food given in barracks, 



136 



THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REOUIRED 



industrial schools, almshouses, and poor-houses, is devoid of 
proper seasoning. It is to be hoped that this stigma has been 
removed, for unpalalability is one of the greatest hindrances to 
the consumption of food, and especiallj^ of the same dietar3^ when 
continued over long periods. The flavour of the foods should not 
be too pronounced, nor the condiments used in excess, otherwise 
it may become nauseous, or at the very least be provocative of 
indigestion, liver troubles, etc.

The British war ration has been fixed as the result of considerable 
experience. Available data show that for constant marching and 
fighting about 4,500 calories of energy would be needed; but the 
amount of physical work done in war varies considerably, so that 
the ration supplied is fixed to yield somewhat less than that number 
of calories (see Colonel ]\Ielville's observations, p. 103). The war

It would be the greatest possible mistake to underfeed an army 
in the field ; the working power would be reduced to a minimum ; 
infection and disease would be courted. The Committee of Inquiry, 
appointed by the Government, expressed the opinion that observa- 
tions of a more definite character than those at present available 
were necessary before a definite conclusion could be arrived at 
as to the adequacy of the British war ration. 

The peace ration of Germany is fixed for supplying 2,611 calories 
from the dietary given. The ivar ration includes 181 grammes 
(6 1 ounces) of protein, 64 grammes (2^^ ounces) of fat, 558 grammes 
(19; ounces) of carbohydrate, and 3,442 calories of available energy. 
Zuntz and Schumberg investigated the sufficiency of this chet. 
Six students were set to march in military uniforms and carrying 
the usual accoutrements. The observers found that there was an 
increased output of nitrogen due to marching, which accounted 
for 6 or 7 per cent, of the total energy expended; that for every 
1,000 calories expended there were 800 grammes of water evaporated 
from the body; that a man of 70 kilos weight produced when resting 
1-2 to 1-35 calories of heat per minute, and when marching with 
a load of 31 kilos (68-2 pounds) he produced 773 calories of heat 
per minute. The men were found to expend 3,600 calories on 
" resting " days, and 4,300 calories on marching days. The authors 
concluded that the diet should contain more fat and sugar, but that 
no grammes of protein is enough to maintain the nitrogenous 
metabolism. They found that excessive heat with a light load 
increases the expenditure more than a heavy load on a cold day. 
That the condition of fatigue increases the expenditure of energy 
and lameness increased waste most strikingly. As the result of 
training, there is a most perfect co-orchnation of muscles; fewer 
muscles are used, and work is done most economically. 

The Japanese Army ration in time of peace consisted until 
recently of an allowance of 36 ounces of rice and money for other 
necessaries. This food has been discussed by many people. Baron 
Takaki considered it in connection with the etiology of beri-beri. 
He agreed that the recognized amounts of nitrogen and carbon 
required daily by an adult are 20 grammes of nitrogen and 
310 grammes of carbon, or a ratio of N : C :: i : 15-5. But he 
found that the food of the Japanese soldier or sailor contained 



I3S THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

N : C in the proportion of i : 17 to i : ^2. He proved that the 
greater the difference between tlie proportioTi of N to C in the 
Japanese diet and the recognized normal diet, the greater was the 
anioinit of beri-beri; the less difference there was, the less beri- 
beri occurred. He therefore concluded that beri-beri was due to 
a disproportion between the nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous foods 
in the dietary. In consequence of these investigations, fresh regula- 
tions for the dietary of the Japanese Amiy and Navy were issued 
with the object of raising the proportion of nitrogen to carbon 
and \arying the monotony of the diet. The food now includes 
eggs, fish, fowl, fresh or canned beef, salt beef, salt pork, miso and 
shojoi (preparations of soy-beans), dried beans, bread, wheat, 
flour, rice, sugar, starch, butter, lard, suet, olive-oil, sesame-oil, 
milk, vegetables (such as potatoes, cabbages, onions, carrots, and 
radishes), pickles, salt and other spices, and alcoholic liquors. 
Barley bread was found especially useful in preventing beri-beri. ^ 
The Bengali soldier is another instance of men wdiose dietary 
has a low protein value. This arises from the fact that beef is 
forbidden by their religion, and the3^ eat only small quantities of 
mutton, fowl, and fish; they are, in fact, vegetarians. A number 
of observations on the metabolism of Bengalees was made by Pro- 
fessor McCay, of the Calcutta Medical College. ^ After making 
200 analyses, he concluded that the average daily excretion of 
nitrogen in the urine of the Bengali was only 5-98 grammes, as com- 
pared with 14 to 18 grammes in the European ; and the urea only 
12-95 grammes in the Bengali, as compared with 30 grammes in the 
European. Their average weight was 52 kilos, the European 
average being 66 or 70 kilos. Their height is the same as our own, 
but their chest girth is under 33 inches. The low excretion of 
nitrogen in the urine points to a diet poor in protein, and this 
dietetic peculiarity was exaggerated by the fact that the faeces 
contained 25 per cent, of the total nitrogen of the food, due to the 
large consumption of dhal or pulse, which is no better assimilated 
than other leguminous foods. The food of the Bengali supplies 
o-ii gramme of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight, which corre- 
sponds to the demand made by Chittenden as a standard for this 
element. But it has not been shown that the Bengali is healthier, 
stronger, or possesses greater longevity, than Europeans, who eat 
a much larger amount of nitrogenous food. On the other hand, 
the Bengali is enormoush' inferior in activity and physical en- 
durance to the European. Insurance offices in Calcutta rate all 
Bengali lives as being fi\'e years worse than European lives. At 
the same time, kidney disease is twice as prevalent among the 
natives than it is among Europeans in Calcutta, although scarlet 
fever is unknown in India. Colonel Melville^ says: "As regards 
the power of resistance to disease, I am certain that no officer 
with any prolonged experience of India will deny that the native

In the Navy the ration per day is as follows: Bread, 24 ounces 
(680 grammes), or biscuit, 20 ounces (567 grammes) ; meat, 16 ounces 
(453 grammes) ; vegetables and potato, 16 ounces (453 grammes) ; 
condensed milk, f ounce (21-2 grammes) ; sugar, 3 ounces 
85 grammes) ; jam, 2 ounces (57-7 grammes) ; coffee and tea, | ounce 
(21-2 grammes); salt, | ounce (7-1 gramme); rum, 2| ounces 
(72 grammes). Five days in the week the meat consists of 16 ounces 
of fresh meat; but on the other two days, 4 ounces of fresh meat 
and 12 ounces of salt beef or salt pork, and peasoup or white beans. 
Four days a week there is an allowance of 8 ounces oifresJi potatoes, 
or an equivalent amount of dried ones; three days a week there 
is a smaller allowance of potatoes, but 3 ounces of fresh vegetables 
in addition. Then there is flour, suet, rice, tapioca, and raisins, 
for puddings; curry powder; oatmeal; butter; marmalade; tea; 
sugar, etc. Breakfast consists of curry, stew, or hashed meat ; 
dinner of soup, roast or boiled meat, vegetables, and pudding; 
tea of bread-and-butter and jam or marmalade. The ration has an 
official value of lod. per diem. The allowance of nutriment is suffi- 
cient, even liberal; but the last regular meal or " tea " is not sub- 
stantial enough, considering the length of time between it and the 
breakfast next morning. In 1907 a Departmental Committee was 
appointed to inquire into the victualling arrangements in the fleet, 
and a report was made by the Committee, recommending the 
adoption of a standard ration having an approximate value of 
sixpence a day, but with a messing allowance of fourpence per man. 
It was believed that this would give the men more choice in the 
selection of their food, and allow them to purchase supper if they 
wished to do so. The standard ration suggested by them for use 



140 



THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 



during service at sea is as follows: i pound bread (or J pound 
bread and J pound flour) ; ^ pound fresh meat ; i pound fresh vege- 
tables; 4 ounces sugar; ^ ounce tea or i ounce coffee in lieu of 
I ounce tea, or ^ ounce cocoa for J ounce tea or i ounce coffee; 
I ounce condensed milk ; 4 ounces preserved meat once a week 
while in harbour, and twice a week when at sea; condiments as 
required. 

According to this recommendation of the Committee, the bread 
ration is reduced from ijto i pound a day; they also recommend 
that soft bread be given to the men every day on ships which have 
a baker}-, the present weekly biscuit day being abolished. Hard 
biscuit is not a palatable substitute for bread, and should only be 
used when an absolute necessity arises. The Committee suggested 
that the biscuit ration should be reduced from i^ pounds to | pound, 
and that a new type of biscuit be provided in place of the present 
hard and unpopular variety. They further proposed a reduction 
of the fresh meat ration from f to | pound per man, which they 
found to be the average consumption in the fleet, but to allow 
an additional ^ pound per man to be taken up if desired, on pay- 
ment for same out of the " messing allowance," at a charge of 
4d. per pound; w'hile the ration in war-time and under arduous 
duties should remain at | pound of fresh meat per man. The salt 
pork ration was also recommended to be reduced from | to | pound 
per man, and the preserved meat ration from 9 to 6 ounces. 

The food on a merchant ship is as follows {weekly allowance) :

W'itli regard to vegetables, the Committee recommended that tlie 
allowance of i pound of vegetables per man with fresh meat should 
be retained, and that a ration of \ pound of potatoes per man 
should be served with salt pork or preserved meat. The fresh milk 
ration was increased from J to \ pint per man; the sugar from 
3 to 4 ounces; the tea from -J to ^ ounce; the cocoa to be reduced 
accordingly from ^ to ^ ounce, and coffee allowed as an alternative; 
the jam to be reduced from 2 ounces to i ounce.

Prison Dietary. — ^The ordinary diet consists of — Breakfast : a 
pint of oatmeal gruel, and bread. Dinner: beans, bacon, and 
potatoes; stewed beef and potatoes; or mutton and potatoes, 
alternatively. Supper: a pint of gruel, and bread. Prisoners who 
are not in good health have whatever the doctor orders them. 
The diet No. IV. for men doing hard labour in English prisons may 
be taken as an example for consideration: Breakfast: bread, 
8 ounces; and gruel or porridge, i pint. Dinner: {a) bread, 
6 ounces; potato, 8 ounces; suet pudding, 12 ounces; or [h] bread, 
Bounces; potato, 12 ounces; cooked meat, free from bone, 4 ounces; 
or (c) bread, 8 ounces; potato, 12 ounces; soup, i pint. Supper: 
bread, 6 or 8 ounces; gruel or porridge, i pint. 

The meat is beef; bread is made from whole meal; gruel is made 
with 2 ounces, and porridge with 3 ounces, of coarse oatmeal to 
each pint of water, and salt. The suet pudding contains ij ounces 
of mutton suet, 8 ounces of flour, and 6\ ounces of water to each 
pound, with sufficient salt. Each pint of soup contains 4 ounces 
of meat, 4 ounces of split peas, 2 ounces of fresh vegetables, i J ounces 
of onions, with pepper and salt. The entire daily ration contains

The dietaries of English prisons are well chosen and good on the 
whole. An investigation into them was made in 1899 by Crawford 
Dunlop,^ who reported to the Commissioners thereon. He reported 
that, even when engaged in the most active form of prison labour, 
the prisoner works for a shorter time and has a longer rest than 
the ordinary free labourer. He concluded from this that the food 
required by a prisoner is not more than that required by the free 
labourer. He therefore considered that the standard diet for 
moderate or ordinary work was applicable to the prisoners, and 
recommended that the prisoners' dietary should contain 120 grammes 
of protein, 38 grammes of fat, and not more than 550 grammes of 
carbohydrate. He recommended that the energy value of the 
food for ordinary prisoners should be 3,100 calories; that an extra 
allowance of protein and fat {e.g., meat) should be given those per- 
forming severe labours; and also an extra allowance should be made 
for large men and nursing-mothers. As the average woman requires 
less food than a man, he recommended an allowance of protein 96, 
fat 30, carbohydrate 440, grammes, having an energy value of 
2,480 calories, as sufficient for women doing moderate work. For 
juveniles under sixteen years he recommended Camerer's standard 
dietary' as sufficient — viz., protein 75, fat 42, carbohydrates 325, 
grammes, yielding 2,040 calories.

After allowing for waste and the food consumed by the employees, 
the dietary gave for each woman an average of 58 grammes of 
protein, 83 grammes of fat, 228 grammes of carbohydrate, and 
1,882 calories, and a cost of 18 cents per day. The variety of 
foods is remarkable, and the number of kinds of fruit and vegetables 
adds largely to the nutritive value of the food by stimulating 
digestion, which is a matter of great importance in old persons. 
The bread is supplied in 2-pound loaves, baked in a tin, thus 
avoiding an excess of crust, which would probably be wasted. 
Coffee, tea, and milk are always served for breakfast, tea or coffee 
and milk for dinner, and tea and milk for supper. The quantity 
of food alloived to each person is unlimited. Meat or fish is given 
with every dinner ; meat left from dinner is served at supper to the 
few persons who desire it. Roast beef is served cold for dinner on 
Sunday. Potatoes and green vegetables are given every day. 
Rice or rice-pudding is served nearly every day. A hot dish is 
provided for supper except on Sunday, when it is replaced by

cake. Dessert is given most clays. Ihe following is a sample 
menu : 

Breakfast. — Oatmeal, dry Haked cereal, chipped beef, potatoes, bread, 
butter, tea, coffee, milk, and sugar. 

Dinner. — Fried ham, mashed potatoes, lettuce with salad dressing; boiled 
rice; colfce, bread-and-butter. 

Supper. — Corn muffins, butter, tomato preserves, tea, milk. 

Another e.xample may be taken from Bayview Asylum.^ This 
inslitution, while not being primarily an insane asylum, admits 
pauper insane persons and treats them in a separate ward. It is 
an institution for the aged and infirm who are unable to support 
themselves or find others to support them. It is in every respect 
a counterpart of an English workhouse or poorhouse. The inmates 
vary from middle life to old age, males and females being in about 
the same number. In the men's dining-room the ration system is 
followed entirely, except with regard to bread, which is allowed 
ad libitum. The menu for one week was as follows: 

May 8. — Roast baef, boiled beef, soup, hash (boiled meat and potatoes), 
bread, milk, sugar, baked potatoes, apple sauce. 

May 9. — Soup, hash, boiled pork, bread, milk, sugar. 

May 10. — Soup, hash, roast beef, boiled [pork, radishes, bread, milk, sugar. 

May II. — Soup, hash, boiled beef, roast beef, boiled pork, boiled potatoes, 
bread, milk, sugar. 

May 12.— Baked herring, hash, boiled pork, bread, sugar, milk. 

May 13. — Soup, hash, bread, butter, radishes, sugar, milk. 

May 14. — Hash, roast beef, boiled pork, cabbage, potatoes, bread, milk, 
sugar. 

The entire dietary, after deducting waste, included 144 grammes 
of protein, and 2,901 calories per day per man. The food was 
given at three meals a day, a sample of its distribution being as 
follows : 

Breakfast. — Boiled oatmeal, milk, bread, butter, eggs, tea, and coffee. 
Dinner. — Beef soup, with vegetables and bread. 
Supper. — Bread, and coffee. 

On the same day the able-bodied women received: 

Breakfast. — Oatmeal, milk, Hamburg steak, bread, butter, tea, and coffee. 
Dinner. — Bacon, beef soup, vegetables, rice, milk, and bread. 
Supper. — Bread, butter, tea, and coffee. 

The women's food, derived from a dietary for the week similar 
to the men's, gave 85 grammes of protein and 1,924 calories a day 
per W(jman. 

Orphanage Dietaries. — The following was fomierly the menu of an 
orphan home lor girls between four and seventeen years of age : 

Breakfast. — Bread and dripping, milk and water. 

Dinner. — Monday: Vegetable soup. Tuesday: Peasoup. Wednesday: 
Suet pudding and treacle. Thursday: Bread and cheese. Friday: Rice 
pudding. Saturday: Fried fish. Sunday: Bread-and-butter pudding. 

Tea. — Bread and dripping, cocoa made from nibs.

146 THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

The amount of meat used for making the soups, and the amount 
of milk, sugar, peas, rice, etc., is not stated. Ji is a bad example 
of dietary for children. The amount of bread should be unlimited, 
and the meat should vary according to the age of the child. A 
child of six or seven years requires 3^ or 4 ounces of meat daily; 
a boy of nine or ten years, 6 ounces; and youths of fifteen or six- 
teen years, 9 ounces of meat free from bone. The children in 
orphanages and similar institutions are the most likelj' to suffer 
a deficiency of animal food because of its cost. Orphanages should 
be under Government inspection, and the dietary from week to 
week ought to be reported to a Government official, whose duty 
it should be to check the quantity and quality of the food. When 
the cost of meat is greater than the revenue of an institution of this 
character will bear, the advantages of peas, beans, lentils, and nuts, 
as sources of protein, should be impressed upon the managers. 
\\'hatever variety of diet is provided, it should always be suffi- 
ciently abundant to satisfy the cravings of hunger, it should con- 
tain not less than 2 grammes of protein per kilo of body-weight 
(thereby allowing 0-5 gramme per kilo for growth), it should con- 
tain about the same proportion of fat, and the carbohydrate, 
exemplified by bread, should be unstinted. Such a dietary might 
consist of the following articles:

The dietary of children is still further discussed in a chapter on 
the feeding of infants and children; but the following dietaries may 
be quoted here, especially as they were prepared for philanthropic 
purposes. The importance of seeing that school children are 
properly fed cannot be over-rated; and this has been fully recognized 
by the various educational authorities during the past quarter 
of a century. As far distant as 1886 the Birmingham School 
Board instituted farthing dinners for necessitous children. The 
rationale was based on the nutritive efficiency of the legumes; the 
meal consisted of soup made from peas, lentils, or maize, or cocoa 
and milk with bread and jam, or bread and milk. The actual 
cost of the meal varied from 0-39 to 0-53 pence per head, and aver- 
aged 0-45 pence per head for 356,480 dinners. 

At a later date Xiven, of ^lanchester, recommended the following 
three meals for school children who were provided /^y' meals : 

First Meal. — Two ounces of oatmeal and 2 ounces of sugar made into 
porridge. It contains 8'i6 grammes prote.in, 5'62 of fat, and yields 287-5 
calories. 

Second Meal. — One pint of peasoup containing 4 ounces of peas, with 
8 ounces of bread. This contains 38-6 grammes protein, 4 grammes fat, and 
987'5 calories. 

Third Meal. — Eight ounces of bread and i ounce of margarine or dripping. 
It contains 15 grammes protein, 24 grammes fat, and yields 804-6 calories. 

Dr. Niven estimates that a child of seven years requires daily 
62-5 grammes of protein and 1^50 calories of energy, and that his 
three meals contain enough to supply them. The dietary is some- 
what deftcient in fat, which could be improved by giving margarine 
or dripping to the bread in the second meal. Niven considers 
that the gain in wealth to the community obtained by passing 
children on to the working period in a state of physical cfliciency 
would be so enormous as to full}' justif\' the additional bmden

The Food for Athletes.— It has been a custom for generations 
past, when the body is being " trained " for arduous work, to con- 
sume a larger portion of protein foods than at ordinary times. 
During training at Oxford University the breakfast consists of 
underdone beef or mutton, dry toast or crust of bread, and one 
cupful of tea; the midday mcaloi meat, but no vegetables or pudding, 
and a pint of beer; the evening meal of cold meat, watercress or other 
green salad, and a pint of beer. According to ]\Iaclaren, the food 
at Cambridge University is similar, but more vegetables are allowed. 
King, the trainer, adopted the following regimen: Breakfast: two 
mutton chops with a small amount of dry toast, stale bread, or 
crust, and a cup of tea without sugar. Dinner : 1^ pounds lean 
beef or mutton, greens, one potato, toast or stale bread, and ^ pint 
of ale. Tea : an egg with dry toast and a cup of tea. Supper : ^ pint 
of ale or gruel. If nothing is taken at teatime, the supper may 
consist of cold meat, lettuce, watercress, a little stale bread, and a 
pint of beer. The exercise consists of walking up to twenty miles 
a day, and rowing, cricket, boxing, or other exercise in which it 
is desired to excel. The object is to reduce fat, and develop muscle, 
or strength, activity, and endurance. If this regime is carried too 
far, the body is " over-trained " and weakened. If the subject is 
still encumbered with fat, he is considered " under-trained." 

Is it^possible to regulate the diet so as to produce a gain of mus- 
cular tissue ? Such a process normally occurs during growth, 
convalescence, and after a period of insufficient food. PIxperiments 
on animals have shown that, when the food contains an excess of 
protein, some of it may be stored in the cells as reserve protein 
and a part may be utilized for the formation of new cells. But 
there is no evidence in favour of the consumption of an excess of 
protein for this purpose. The training diet is chiefly of use in 
reducing fat. It is, however, undoubted that groups of muscle 
can be increased in size and volume by training. But the increase 
is not due to food alone; it is a hyperplasia or work-hypertrophy, 
due to stimulation by increased activity, the inherent power of 
growth in the cells, and a sufficiency of nutriment. There is no 
evidence that a great increase of protein encourages the growth 
of muscle beyond moderate limits. The protein required for this 
purpose is furnished by the blood, which is made to circulate more 
freely through the tissues by exercise, and it is very little more 
than that required in ordinary circumstances. The amount re- 
quired is certainly no more than a child requires during the most 
active period of growth — viz., 175 to 2-0 grammes of protein per 
kilo of body-weight, and therefore the allowance during training 
for a man of 154 pounds (70 kilos) should be from 123 to 140 grammes 
daily. There is evidence to show that when the protein consumed 
exceeds 190 grammes daily, the retained nitrogen does not amount 



FOOD FOR ATFf/.r.Tf-S 



M9 



to more than 5 or 6 graninies a day, and tliat for only a short 
period. 

It should not be overlooked, in connection with increased mus- 
cular work, that the immediate source of muscular energy is a 
carbohydrate. This fact depreciates the value of the long-estab- 
lished training diets. King's diet, detailed above, contains 240 
grammes of protein and 2,540 calories; but the amount of carbo- 
hydrate is only 130 grammes, and the total food-value no more 
than would be required by a man doing very light work. Such a 
diet is physiologically wrong; its chief value lies in being a fat- 
reducer. It is not a strengthening diet. The diet for increased 
muscular work, athletic, or other exercise, must consist of a general 
increase of the standard diet, with a leaning towards carbohydrates. 
Benedict considers a proper diet would contain 2-5 grammes of 
protein and 70 or 80 calories per kilo of body- weight, or 175 grammes 
of protein and 430 to 500 grammes of carbohydrate. The following 
table gives examples of the food actually consumed by various 
athletes:

The value of the old dietaries consists in the reduction of fat; 
by the combination of diet, exercise, and massage, superfluous fat 
is reduced. When the body is well-trained, it has not an ounce of 
unnecessary fat, the muscles are firm and tough, the heart and 
lungs in good working order, and the highest degree of strength, 
activity, and endurance, is attained. But to insure the continuance 
of this condition tlie excessive consumption of protein, to the ex- 
clusion of carbohydrate, must not be carried on too long. There is 
no advantage, in fact a disadvantage, in cutting down carbohydrates 
when the body has attained a proper condition. 

The Food to be consumed during Severe Exercise. — In an exercise 
of short duration no food is required ; but during prolonged exertion, 
in swimming, walking, climbing, riding, cycling, etc., it is necessary 
to take some nourishment, which should consist chiefly of water 
and substances dissolved therein. The nutrients of special value 
are sugar and albumin in an assimilable form ; substances con- 
taining creatin — e.g., beef-tea, meat-extract, yeast-extract, also 



I50 THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

tea and coffee; or a small amount of alcohol near the end of the 
exercise ; plain water, barley or oatmeal water. The value of sugar 
as a stimulant to tired muscles is abundantly proved by experience 
and confirmed by the ergograph. It may be taken in tea, coffee, 
lemon-water, barley-water, chocolate, candy, or ordinary lump 
sugar to the extent of 2 ounces a day. Some people prefer to take 
it in raisins or dates, which are also somewhat demulcent. Next 
to sugar, albumin in the form of raw eggs, white of egg and extract 
of meat, or white of egg and lemon-water, is the most important 
food to be taken during prolonged exertion. Water in various 
forms should be taken freely. The athlete should be warned 
against drinking a large amount of milk when overheated. A small 
meal every two hours is better than a large meal with a greater 
interval. In long-distance walking — e.g., lOO miles in twenty- 
four hours — failure often arises from the condition known as 
" walkers' stomach," in which there is pain in the epigastrium, 
belching, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. It is probably due to 
the consumption of solid food during the exercise; the psychic 
gastric juice is absent, the increased circulation through the volun- 
tary muscles causes more or less anaemia of the splanchnic area 
with diminution of the gastric juice, and the diminution of HCl 
favours the evolution of gas. At the same time there is a diminu- 
tion of the osmotic pressure in the stomach, but an increase of the 
pressure of the gases in the blood, owing to the great activity of the 
body, whence there is a reversal of the ordinar}' process, COg being 
excreted through the stomach as well as the lungs. 

The Food required for Mental Work. — There is no evidence from 
I'xperiments tliat mental activity exercises any demonstrable 
influence on the metabolism of nitrogen and carbon; the energy 
used in brain-work is not measurable by the most careful calori- 
metric observations. The actual energy set free by a nervous 
impulse is so small that the chemical changes attending it cannot 
be recognized by any means at our disposal. Nevertheless, cerebral 
activity is attendee! by molecular changes in the cells; there is a 
metabolism of cerebrin, protagon, lecithin, cholesterin, and other 
phosphorized fats. Repeated observation shows that during in- 
tellectual labour the absorption of nitrogen and phosphoric acid 
from the alimentar}' canal is diminished as compared with absorp- 
tion during repose and after mental work. As regards elimination, 
Mairet and Florence^ found more nitrogen and phosphoric acid are 
excreted in the urine than absorbed during mental work. Hoppe- 
Seyler says it has never been proved that the excretion of phos- 
phoric acid is increased by mental work; and Halliburton says that 
in any case the amount of phosphoric acid arising from cerebral 
metabolism must be very small. While admitting, therefore, that 
the expenditure of material in the performance of mental work is 
small, it is necessary to point out the inchrect but great influence 
of brain-work on the entire organism. The closeness and intricacy 

* " Jm Travail Intellectual et les Fonctions de rOrganisme," 1907. 



rnOD FOR Ml.NTAL WORK 131 

of the ties which bind all parts of the organism together is shown 
by the tendency of mental work, worry, and anxiety, to derange 
the digestive and general metabolic functions of the body. If, 
therefore, any special diet is required by brain-workers, it bears 
no particular relation to the brain, but it must have a special 
reference to the alimentary organs. Any arrangement of the food 
for facilitating brain-work must be directed to lightening the labour 
of the stomach and keeping the liver and eliminating organs in 
healthy action. A man whose work is sedentary and chiefly mental 
does not require so much food as a man doing nmscular work. 
Under such circumstances the expenditure of the body varies 
from 32 to 35 calories per kilo, or about 2,250 to 2,450 calories for 
a man of average weight. As regards protein, it has been shown 
that mental work can be done on an allowance of 075 gramme 
per kilo, or from 52 to 57 grammes of protein daily for a man of 
154 pounds. The author does not agree with so small an allowance, 
but considers an allowance of i gramme per kilo, or 70 grammes 
daily, is small enough, and 1-5 grammes per kilo is nearer the normal 
requirement. The importance of fat in the food is shown by the 
fact that muscle contains 3 per cent., brain 9 per cent., and nerves 
22 per cent., of fat. The amount of carbohydrate required is smaller 
than for muscular work. When these facts are considered, the 
dietary of Ranke, now classical, appears to be typical of what the 
brain-worker requires — viz., protein 100 grammes, fat 100 grammes, 
carbohydrate 240 grammes, and energy 2,310 calories. 

The diet should'not be bulky; it should be light and digestible, 
and may be selected from the following articles: Fish — sole, plaice, 
whiting, haddock, brill, turbot, skate, flounder, cod, oysters; lamb, 
mutton, tender beef (free from skin and gristle) ; pheasant, fowl, 
rabbit; eggs, bacon, fat ham; milk, cream, cream-cheese, butter; 
stale bread, dry toast, zwiebach, biscuit (crackers); oatmeal; 
blanc-mange, junket, custard, jelly, milk puddings, potatoes, 
asparagus, seakale, spinach, cauliflower, vegetable marrow (squash), 
kidney beans, green peas; small quantities of cabbage, savoy, kale, 
Brussels-sprouts; and puree of carrots, turnips, or swedes (ruta- 
baga). Cooked fruits may be eaten in moderation, as well as a 
small amount of fresh fruit. Tea, coffee, and cocoa should con- 
stitute the chief beverages. Sir W. Roberts says: "They are not 
inappropriately termed brain-foods, and must be regarded as a very 
important part of the equipment for the struggle for that higher 
and better existence which is almost exclusively a brain stniggle." 
Fish is chiefly of value because it is light and easily digested, and 
not because it has any special claim to be regarded as a brain-food. 
Excess of food is bad for everybody, but especially for the brain- 
worker. Heavy foods are particularly bad for him, because they 
produce heaviness, dulness, and drowsiness. Spiced foods and rich 
foods upset the alimentary functions, whereby the circulation is 
flooded with the products of imperfect metabolism to the detriment 
of the brain. Water is the best beverage to take with the meals, 



152 THE AMOUNT OF FOOD REQUIRED 

but tlic use of tea and coffee is coiuniendable; theyliave an invigor- 
ating effect arising from caffein and essential oils. There is some- 
times a tendency to abuse tliese valuable foods. This is a mistake, 
and may lead to the development of undesirable effects and inter- 
ference with brain -work. Alcohol may or may not assist the brain- 
worker. It may be necessarj', owing to some idiosyncrasy of the 
individual. The primar}' effect of alcohol is stimulation of the 
brain; it makes it quick and active; it excites the imagination, 
creates a light and free phaseology and a gay and hilarious volubility, 
or prolonged verbosity may result ; but this is followed by a second- 
ary depression during which the intellect is blunted, the mind is 
dull, and its \'ivacity is suppressed. Indeed, it has been pro\ed 
again and again that, when mental work is the regular occupation, 
the fullest and best results are obtained without its aid, that the 
depression or fatigue following stimulation by alcohol is greater 
than the fatigue from mental work performed without it. As 
regards special mental efforts, many observations have been made. 
Kraepelin of Heidelberg investigated this matter in various subjects 
after they had taken a small dose of alcohol (-| to i ounce of whisky). 
The exercises were reading aloud, adding columns of figures, making 
arithmetical calculations, and committing figures to memory. 
Reading was quickened, but mistakes were more frequent ; the 
power to add figures was not improved, but declined after taking 
the alcohol for twelve days; lOO figures were correctly memorized 
by 40 repetitions without alcohol, but onh' 60 figures were correctly 
given after 60 repetitions under its influence. IMcDougall tested 
its effects on the attention, and found the subjects made 53 per 
cent, more errors when the\' consumed from i to 3 ounces of whisky 
than when none was taken. I join with those who find mental 
work cannot be done so well with alcohol as without it. Alcohol 
excites the imagination and gives an increased feeling of importance, 
it promotes the flow of language, raises the spirits, enlivens the 
mind, and sharpens the wit. This stimulation is due to an in- 
creased flow of blood through the brain, which causes a quickening 
of the cerebral functions. But this effect is comparatively brief 
in duration — too short to be of any use to the man whose daily 
bread depends on the results of brain-work. It is the condition of 
the after-dinner speaker, whose imagination is brisk, thoughts 
fluent, and language fervid. The after-dinner speech, so brilliant 
and witty, unless pre\nously thought-out, is apt to be unsatisfactor}' 
to the orator in his cooler moments; alcohol interferes with the 
power of clear judgment and criticism, and the emotions come into 
play uncontrolled by the guiding influence of reason. 

It may be necessary' for the brain-worker to take a little beer, 
wine, or diluted spirits, for some other purpose than stimulating his 
cerebral faculties. As an appetizer and invigorator a moderate 
amount may be of value to the individual whose stomach has lost 
tone through a sedentar\- life, over\\ork, or worry. But the amount 
must be kept within very small limits if the head is to be kept clear,

tlie stomach free from catarrli, and the hver in working order — all 
points of importance when work depends upon a clear head, mental 
acti\it\', and a feeling of well-being. 

The Influence of Climate on Diet. — The performance of mechanical 
labour necessitates the same expenditure of energy in every cHmate. 
But the climate influences the radiation of heat from the body; 
this is greater in a cold or wet climate and less in a hot than in a 
temperate climate. Therefore, a priori, more food is required in a 
cold and less in a hot than in a temperate climate. But it is modified 
by circumstances. Civilized people prevent the greater loss of 
heat in a cold climate by living in warm houses and wearing warm 
clothing; and they promote the radiation of heat and evaporation 
from their body in a warm climate by wearing thin clothing. 

When the body is exposed to a low temperature, there is an 
increase of metabolism resulting in the discharge of a larger quantity 
of CO,, which should be met by a corresponding increase in the 
consumption of carbonaceous foods. Fat supplies twice as much 
heat as the same amount of carbohydrate, while protein supples 
about the same heat as carbohydrate; therefore the increased 
consumption of animal food is a scientific procedure which is in- 
stinctively adopted by the natives, and this rule may be safely 
followed by visitors to Arctic and other cold regions. 

When a body is exposed to the greater heat of tropical climates, 
the metabolism is slightly decreased, but the production of heat 
is not much less than in a temperate climate. Whence it is con- 
cluded that it is not necessary to take less food in hot cHmates, but 
to slightly increase the intake of carbohydrates to supply the heat 
radiated from the skin, and with the special object of promoting 
perspiration. The natives of hot climates, as a rule, consume less 
animal food and more vegetables and fruit than those of temperate 
regions. This may be considered a good rule to be followed b}' 
those from temperate regions who go to live in the tropics; but 
such a conclusion is questionable. Medical testimony and scientific 
fact are somewhat opposed to it. Long centuries of usage has 
accustomed the natives to consume large quantities of rice, millet, 
dhal (pulse), manioc, and other vegetables; but a person un- 
accustomed to such diet would be unable to consume and digest it — 
the bulk would be too much for him. Moreover, it is a low protein 
diet, and it is established that there should be a definite ratio be- 
tween the proportion of nitrogen and carbon in the food. The 
metabolism of nitrogen and carbon is very little disturbed by 
transferring the body from one region of the earth to another ; but 
it is greatly influenced by exercise or its absence. There are ex- 
ceptions to the rule of vegetarianism' even among the natives. The 
Arabs of East Africa, the Abyssinians, the Pampas Indians, are all 
consumers of great quantities of meat, but they are very active 
people. Moreover, the consumption of meat is largel}^ controlled 
by religion. The ox is sacred to 250 millions of inhabitants in 
India. The^hog is an abomination to the Hindus and Moham-

metUms, as it was to the ancient Egyptians and is to the Hebrews 
to-day. In Bengal, Madras, Assam, Bumiah, and Siam the food 
of the people consists of rice, pulse (dhal), vegetables, fruit, and 
cocoanuts. There are Hindus who take no animal food except 
milk and ghee; but others take eggs, fish, and game while they 
refuse beef and pork. The Sikhs eat mutton and goat-flesh. The 
Hindus of the Punjab eat no meat, but the ]\Iohammedans of the 
same region do, although they eat less than the European residents, 
and their prolonged fasts may assist their organs to recover from 
any ill-effects. Simpson^ says the European residents would do 
well to copy the example of the Aryans. " \\'hen the Aryans 
descended into the plains of India they were meat-eaters, but ex- 
perience taught them to be vegetarians or sparing in the consump- 
tion of animal food, and to refuse alcohol. . . . Europeans accus- 
tomed to live well in their own country, where large quantities of 
meat, wine, and spirits form an important part of the diet, are 
tempted to continue a similar diet in the tropics. Some do well 
on it, but they are exceptions. The majority who persist in high 
living in the tropics pay for it, sooner or later, in intestinal disorders, 
colitis, disease of the liver, or nervous disorder. . . . The history of 
the British occupation of India is full of sickness and death from 
want of adjustment of the diet to the new conditions. ... It is 
recorded that the life of a regiment fomierly was five years. There 
was no attempt to adjust the mode of life to the conditions. But 
a gradual improvement in the diet has effected a change in the 
health and mortality of Europeans. This consists of a general 
tendency towards a modified vegetarianism." 

It has been observed that Europeans born and bred in the tropics 
have less desire for meat than full-grown people who arrive there. 
If they have any special craving, it is for sweet things. The large 
share which sugar takes in the diet of the tropical inhabitant is 
remarkable. Sweetmeats of every kind are used, and presents of 
sweetmeats and fruit are there equivalent to presents of game in 
colder climates. 

Sir R. Havelock Charles^ saj's it is impossible to fonn exact 
rules for dietary in the tropics because there are differences of climate 
which require modifications. He says nothing about limiting the 
amount of meat; but he says: "No cold meat whatever should 
come on the table; it is important that everything should come 
straight from the fire to the table. It cannot then cause bacilliary 
mischief, and there should be no fear of cholera or dysentery. 
Boiled water only should be drunk; no salads of any kind should 
be used except in the greatest moderation." As regards fruit, 
everything which possess a rind that can be removed may be eaten 
raw with impunity (provided it is peeled) by a healthy man at any 
time of the year. Fruits which do not possess a rind are incapable 
of being thoroughly cleansed; such fniit may be contaminated 
and dangerous to the consumer, and at any rate ought only to be

consmncil aftt-r it is cooked. TlKTcforc oranf^es, grape-fmit, pears, 
apples, bananas, mangoes, pineapple, custard-apples, mangostcen, 
tomatoes, etc., may be eaten raw after peeling them; but it would 
be unsafe to eat grapes, currants, strawberries, and other fruit 
which cannot be peeled, until they are cooked. In most places 
inlial)ited by Europeans, cabbage, cauliflower, kidney beans (snap 
or string beans), green peas, pumpkins, vegetable marrow (squash), 
and other vegetables are grown, and should be eaten freah boiled. 
In some places green maize or Indian corn {mealies) are eaten 
after being boilecl in milk or roasted in ashes; the boiled fruit of 
pa])an resembles a vegetable marrow; green bananas or plantains, 
boiled or roasted, also form an excellent vegetable. Potatoes are 
grown in many tropical places; but sweet potatoes, yams, taro, 
and cassava, when properly cooked, are a good substitute. As bread 
forms one of the chief sources of carbohydrate in the European 
dietar}', it should still be consumed whenever it is obtainable; but 
there are many excellent substitutes, such as rice, maize, banana- 
meal, poie (from Caladium esciilentmn), manioc, sago, tapioca, vermi- 
celli, macaroni, and biscuits. The various methods of cooking and 
utilizing these foods must be learnt from those who have lived long 
in such countries. 

As regards proteins, some fish, fowl, or meat may be taken for 
breakfast ; animal food ought not to be taken in the middle of the 
day, it is better to take dinner in the evening; beef, mutton, pork, 
kid (goat-flesh), venison (deer and antelope), poultry (many kinds 
of birds), eggs, and fish are obtainable in one place or another. 
Tinned meat and fish should be avoided as a general rule; indeed, 
the importance of fresh food is so great that hunting, shooting, and 
fishing should be strongly recommended as exercises. The flesh 
of native pig, deer, antelope, kid, birds, eggs, fish, turtle, and even 
molluscs, when fresh, is safer by far than tinned food. Other 
sources of protein are nuts {e.g., pea-nuts), bean or pea-flour, banana- 
flour, and oatmeal, which, being eaten with milk, in the form of 
porridge or soup, forms a nutritious food. 

Fat is obtained in the form of meat, dripping, butter, ghee, nuts, 
and various oils used in cooking. The pure oils from pea-nuts, 
palm-nuts, and cocoanuts are salutary; but many samples are 
adulterated with sesame-oil, poppy-seed oil, and colza-oil, which 
are deleterious by causing dyspepsia or other gastro-intestinal 
troubles, which in turn render the subject susceptible to dysentery, 
sprue, and other tropical disorders. 

As regards drink, unboiled water should never be taken; boiled 
water can be made palatable by fruit-juices, etc. Soda-water 
should be suspected ; it is better to do without it unless it is quite 
above suspicion. Alcohol is absolutely unnecessary. Sir R. 
Havelock Charles says: " My own conviction is alcohol is unneces- 
sary; if taken at all, it should be as a luxury. . . . Let a boy be an 
abstainer until he is thirty years of age, when he can use his own 
discretion." It is admitted bv all authorities that the use of alcohol

in tlio tropics is a matter rcquiriiip: grave consideration, and that 
men are better in liealtli and can perform their duties without 
more satisfactorily tlian with it. Mohammedanism is against its 
use, and is backed up by science. Spirits are very deleterious unless 
freely diluted. Wine and beer ought to be drunk in moderation; 
about half a pint of red wine or one pint of beer daily is considered 
a fair allowance, and even that is better replaced by tea, coffee, 
cocoa, or their substitutes — caffer tea, Dorn-the, goora-nut, kola, 
kat, mote, guarana, and other native beverages. The native 
alcoholic beverages are as injurious as European drinks. Sake in 
Japan, tar-asum in China, and chong in Thibet are prepared from 
rice, millet, and other grains. The sap of palmyra is drunk in its 
natural condition in India and Ceylon; but it is also fermented to 
make palm-wine, and a spirituous liquor called " toddy " is distilled 
from it. The milk of the cocoanut and sap of the tree are drunk 
unfennented wherever they grow; but they are femiented to form 
wine, and toddy is distilled from them. A spirit distilled from 
rice liquor is sold as doasta in Calcutta. According to Mann, it is 
20 degrees under proof, but contains 0-56 per cent, of higher alcohols, 
or 491 grains per gallon. Shajehanjur rum, made from sugar refuse, 
is sold 53 to 56 degrees under proof. Mahua spirit is made from 
the flowers of Bassia latifolia in Bengal and Assam; it is sold 22 to 
50 degrees under proof, and contains 0-004 to 033 per cent, of higher 
alcohols, which are very deleterious. Arrack is distilled from the 
sap of the palm-tree in India and Ceylon, and is frequently drugged 
with Indian hemp and other narcotics. The fruit of Carambola 
is used to make sherbet in India, and that of the sour gourd in 
Africa; the fruit of mangroves is also fermented in the East and 
West Indies. The juice of cacti is fermented wherever they grow. 
Pulque is the fermented juice of the agave or American aloe; it 
resembles cider, but has an odour of putrid meat ; from it is distilled 
a spirit called " octli." In South America the juice of the cow-tree 
is used as a beverage; and in the West Indies another milky fluid 
is obtained from Taberna montana ittilis. In Tartary the fermented 
mare's or ass's milk yields a spirit called arika ; and in the Caucasus 
kephir is distilled to produce a spirit called skhou. There is no 
difference in^ the alcohol produced from these sources, and the 
higher alcohols which they contain are as deleterious as those in 
European spirits.

CHAPTER V 
THE FEEDING OF INFANTS AND CHILDREN 

In the preceding chapter the amount of food required by adults 
has been considered. It is now necessary to inquire into the 
amount required by infants and children, and to criticize the 
current methods of dieting them, and to make suggestions thereon. 

The natural food of the mammalian animal before it is able to 
forage for itself is the milk of its own mother. The natural food 
of the human infant therefore is human milk, the average com- 
position of which is — Protein 2-18, fat 362, lactose 579, salts 0-22, 
and water 88-19, per cent. But it varies considerably, the protein 
going from 0-85 to 4-86, fat 2-11 to 6-89, lactose 4-36 to 7-12, and 
the total solids from 9-57 to 13-12, per cent. These figures have 
been drawn from a careful consideration of the analyses given by 
sixteen authorities. At birth the capacity of the child's stomach 
is about an ounce, and during the first week it takes from 10 to 15 
ounces daily. Tarnier found that from the fifth to the thirtieth 
day a child actually takes from 17 to 21 ounces (500 to 600 grammes), 
and from one to three months 21 to 28 ounces (600 to 800 grammes). 
These figures show that the amount of nutriment consumed varies 
as follows:

A considerable proportion of women, for various reasons, are 
unable to suckle their young. Some substitute must be found from 
birth for the mother's milk. This may consist of the milk of the 
cow, goat, sheep, or other animal. Goats are frequentl}^ kept for 
feeding children. They are not subject to tuberculosis, and are 
easily tended and kept clean. Their milk is somewhat richer in 
protein and fat than human milk; but when mixed with -J to i parts

of a 6 per cent, of lactose solution, made with boiled water, it is 
nearer to human milk in composition. Cow's milk is more often 
used because it may always be obtained. There is considerable 
dillerence in the composition of cow's milk and human milk. 
Human milk contains i to 3 per cent, of casein, and 0-25 to i-o per 
cent, of lactalbumin and lactoglobulin; cow's milk only contains 
0-5 per cent, of lactalbumin and about 3^ per cent, of casein, 
which is not digested so easily. To bring cow's milk nearer to 
human milk in composition and to adapt it to the requirements of 
infants, it is usual to dilute it, and add some sugar and lime-water 
or barley-water. The table on p. 159 is given by Rotch^ to show 
the requirements of infants. 

It is obvious that merely diluting cow's milk with water will not 
secure the percentages recommended by Rotch; but the following 
mi.\tures of milk, sugar, and water are stated by Holt to have the 
composition annexed to them :

The casein of cow's milk coagulates in large heavy masses, very 
difierent from the hght flocculent precipitate of human milk; it 
requires longer time and a greater expenditure of energy for diges- 
tion than human milk. But the formation of large coagula can

be proventod b}' the addition of lime-water, barley-water, dextrin, 
extract of malt, and citrate of soda. The use of these materials for 
tlie purpose indicated is quite common. 

\\ hen cream is diluted with water and acidulated, the protein is 
coagulated in tine feathery llocculi much nearer in character to the 
coagula of human milk than the masses of casein from a mixture 
of milk and water. This has led to the use of cream and top-milk 
in the mixtures for feeding infants. Gravity cream, obtained by 
skinnning the milk after it has been set aside for eight to twelve 
hours, is preferable to centrifugal or commercial cream for this 
purpose. In gravity cream the fat remains in a fine state of 
division, there being one and a half million globules in a single drop; 
but in centrifugal cream the enuilsion is broken down, and the fat is 
in large conglomerate masses. Biedert declared that the essential 
faults of cow's milk as an infant's food could be eliminated by using 
gravity cream obtained by the usual domestic method. Such 
cream usually has the following composition: Fat lo, protein 3-6, 
sugar 4-5, per cent. He arranged the mixtures given in table on 
p. 159, and stated that they have the composition annexed to them. 

Gaertncr's fat milk is an excellent substitute for cream mixtures, 
and is prepared as follows: Dilute i pint of milk with i pint of 
water, and add i ounce of lactose. Raise the temperature of the 
mixture to 97" V. and centrifugalize it ; pour the creamy half into a 
vessel and cool it. It has the following composition: Protein 
1-5 to 2-0, fat 3-25, sugar 6-o, ash 0-37, per cent. A simpler method 
is to put the milk into a glass barrel, with a tap; allow it to stand 
four hours, when practically all the fat will be in the upper half. 
Turn on the tap, and allow the bottom half to flow out. Replace 
the quantity drawn off by the addition of barley-water or plain 
boiled water, the requisite amount of sugar of milk, and a few grains 
of conunon salt.

Top-Milk Mixtures. — ^W la-n a quart ul milk has been standing 
for eight hours, nearly all the fat is in the cream ; it is estimated 
that the upper 4 ounces would contain 21 per cent, of fat, and is 
excellent cream; the upper 6 ounces 16 per cent., 8 ounces 13 per 
cent., II ounces 10 per cent., and 16 ounces 7 per cent., of fat. 
The latter is called 7 per cent, milk, and has the following com- 
position: Fat 7-0, sugar 4-40, and protein 3-50, per cent.; with it 
Holt ' makes the mixtures given in table on p. 160. 

If 10 per cent, milk is used, only 2 ounces should be added to 
make Xo. i, and 3 ounces for No. 2 ; 4 ounces would make No. 3, 
containing not quite so much protein. Winter, of Cornell Univer- 
sity, has also arranged a series of top-milk mixtures composed 
of the same ingredients. Biedert, observing the variable com- 
position of cream obtained by skimming, and the difficulty of 
obtaining it free from undesirable micro-organisms, caused a 
preparation, which he called Ramogen, said to be made from 
goat's milk, to be put up in tins. It is standardized to contain — 
Fat 15, protein 7, milk-sugar 10, cane-sugar 25, per cent. When 
diluted with water, the mixture has the following comjwsition:

Extract of Malt is a useful carbohydrate lor sweetening cow's-

following: Pn)tein 60, lualtose 45-0, dextrin 7-2, invert sugar 14-5, 
cane-sugar 3-4, per cent. It has a beneficial influence over casein, 
causing it to be coagulated in fine flocculi, which are digested much 
more easily than the large masses of casein coagulated without its 
influence. The following mixtures have a proper composition for 
infants of the ages given:

Mix the cream and extract of malt together in a warm vessel, 
stir in the milk and water at a temperature of 130° to 140° F., 
and let it stand ten or fifteen minutes. Where cream cannot be 
obtained, 5 ounce of butter may be used instead of it, taking care 
that it is thoroughly mixed with the extract of malt before adding 
the milk and water. 

Artificial Foods for infants arc veiy numerous. The composition 
of many is given in my book — "Foods: their Origin, Manufacture 
and Composition." They are, of course, not so suitable for the 
infant as human milk. But when this is deficient or unobtain- 
able, many of them are better than improper!}^ prepared milk 
mixtures. Young infants cannot digest starch, and therefore the 
preparation adopted ought to be as free as possible from it. The 
foods of Allenbury, Mellin, Horlick, are among the best of these. 
Several others are self-digesting, as Benger's. When the child is 
a few months old, it may have such foods as contain the higher 
dextrins (approaching to maltose), and later on those having 
lower dextrins (approaching to starch). Malted foods are prefer- 
able to unmalted cereal preparations; the diastase converts the 
starch into dextrins, maltose, iso-maltose, and a little dextrose. 
Savory and Moore's is such a food, and there are many others. 
When the child is over six months old, some oatmeal may be given. 
Chalmers \\'atson and Fordyce made experiments showing that it 
stimulates growth by its action on the thyroid gland, and con- 
cluded that oatmeal and milk is a better food than bread and m.ilk. 

There are various circumstances requiring a modification of the 
diet. In all cases the physician should give very careful and 
definite instructions for feeding the infants under his care. In spite 
of such care various disturbances of the alimentary canal and 
general health may arise; how much more, then, are they likely to 
arise when scrupulous care is not exercised ! In all cases of digestive 



DIGESTIVH TROCIILHS 163 

disturbance, and especially when the condition is acute, there 
should be an immediate reduction of all the constituents of tlie 
food — that is to say, the child must have less food. But the par- 
ticular ailment may require the reduction of only the protein, the 
fat, or the carbohydrate. Vomiting is frequently due to an excess 
of casein in the form of hard curds; pain may be due to the same 
cause; spasm of the pylorus may be caused by such masses of 
casein. When these sympioms arise, the character of the vomit 
shoultl be examined, and the food modified accordingly. If the 
infant is breast-fed, the regular increase in weight ought to show 
that he is getting enough. If he is not getting enough food this 
way, the weight-chart will not show a satisfactory rise week by week. 
The mother's milk should be supplemented in such a case by the 
cream or top-milk mixtures given above. The use of barley-water 
to prevent the formation of heavy curd from cow's milk has long 
experience to recommend it. It is made by boiling pearl-barley 
until the liquid, after straining and cooling, sets into a thin jelly; 
it contains 1-25 per cent, of solid matters,including about o-iiy per 
cent, nitrogenous, 1-078 per cent, dextrin, 0-02 per cent, fat, and 
0-035 per cent, mineral, matters. When it is prepared from barley- 
Hour, the decoction must of necessity contain some starch, but the 
longer it is cooked the more starch will be dextrinized. The use of 
prepared or artificial foods has to be considered in such cases; those 
consisting of dried milk and malted or dextrinized cereals are the best. 

The kind of sugar in infant's foods may have to be considered. 
Lactic acid is essential for gastric digestion in infants. But the 
glands may secrete too much, and cause the vomited substances to 
be excessivel}^ acid. Acid fermentation in the alimentary canal 
results in the destruction of peptones and lactose. Therefore 
it may be necessary to use some other sugar than lactose in artificial 
feeding. Cane-sugar and maltose pass through the stomach un- 
affected by lactic acid ferments, and should be used when too much 
acidity arises. 

Infants frequently excrete an undue amount of ammonia in their 
urine. It is a consequence of acidosis or acid intoxication, as a 
defect in the metabolism of fat or protein. Czerny and Kcllner 
found it arose from an excess of fat in the food, or an inability on the 
part of the child to properly digest it. In such cases it is advisable 
to reduce temporarily the amount of fat. 

When the digestive trouble arises from excess of curd, the casein 
must be reduced. The proteins of cow's milk are casein and 
albumin in the proportion of 100 to 14; in human milk the pro- 
portion is 100 to 50. But casein can be modified as suggested in the 
cream and top-milk mixtures, or the extract of malt mixtures. 
Sometimes it is necessary to exclude casein altogether for a few 
days. We may then make use of albulactin or other preparations 
of lactalbumin. In cases of zymotic diarrhoea, the use of albumin- 
water is better than any other means of feeding: the white of an 
egg is beaten up and added to 6 ounces of boiled water, a little

cream, lactose, and coiiinion salt. In other cases again peptonized 
milk, J^enger's food, peptogenic milk-powder, etc., may be usefully 
employed. In cases of fat-diarrha>a, whey or butter milk are good 
foods. 

infants fed on cow's-milk mixtures absorb mucli water and excrete 
much urine, and some of them Irequently cry from hunger. \\'hen 
these features are verj- marked, an attempt ma}- be made to feed 
the child with iDidilutcd coiv's milk. Budin, of Paris, had consider- 
able success with this mode of feeding from birth onwards, and 
found children fed in this wa}' " have no tumid abdomen, no milk 
dyspepsia, no scurvy, no rickets, no tuberculosis, no weakness, 
and no flabbiness. " 

Aliter six months of age undiluted cow's milk is one of the best 
foods. But it is not a well-balanced food, as it contains too much 
protein and too little carboh}drate. The average composition of 
many thousands samples of milk analyzed is — Protein 3-73, fat 4-07, 
sugar 4-45, per cent. Now, according to Rotch's table given 
above, a child from six to ten months requires a food having the 
following composition: Protein 2-00, fat 4-00, sugar 7-00, per cent., 
or a daily suppl}- of protein 18 to 27, fat 36 to 54, carbohydrate 
63 to 105, grammes. 

At six months i| pints of milk, and at nine months 2^ pints is 
usually considered a fair allowance; they contain the following: 

if pints of milk contain — Protein 37*3, fat 40-07, sugar 44*45, grammes. 
2^ ,, ,, ,, ,, 52'0, ,, 57*oo, ,, 62*00, ,, 

There is a decided excess of protein and fat in these quantities, 
while the carboliydrate is too little. We can trust, however, to 
the infant's organism effectively splitting some of the excess of 
protein into fat and urea, and some of the excess will be used for 
tissue-building. It is not advisable to keep to a hard-and-fast 
rule, but we must add some carbohydrate. The proprietors of an 
infant's food recommend that a child of nine to twelve months should 
have as follows: 

7 a.m. — Prepared food with 10 ounces of cow's milk. 
10 a.m. — Biscuit or rusk with 10 ounces of cow's milk. 
1.30 p.m. — A raw egg with 10 ounces of cow's milk. 
5.30 p.m. — Prepared food, slice of stale bread, with 10 ounces 
of cow's milk. 
10 p.tn. — Prepared food and 10 ounces of cow's milk. 

The entire food would contain 68 grammes protein, 58 grammes 
fat, and 172 grammes of carbohydrate, and errs on the side of 
generosity even for a child of nine months old. 

At tuo years of age a child requires food containing 2 grammes 
of protein, 4-5 grammes of fat, and 8-o grammes of carbohydrate 
per kilo of body-weight, or half these quantities per pound; and a 
total of 28-0 grammes of protein, 63 grammes of fat, and 112 grammes 
of carbohydrate to meet its expenditure. This would be amply 
met by the following items: ^lilk i pint, farinaceous food 2^ ounces, 
one egg, meat-broth 5^ ounces, milk pudding i^ ounces, bread

A child of three years would be well fed when consuming milk 
I pint, farinaceous food 2J ounces, one egg, meat i ounce, oatmeal 
^ ounce, sugar i ounce, bread 3 ounces, butter ^ ounce, and some 
vegetable or fruit. This diet would contain 53 grammes of protein, 
50 grammes of fat, and 155 grammes of carbohydrate, yielding 
about 1,250 calories. Any adchtion to it might be in the form f)f 
bread-anti-butter. 

When children arrive at three years of age, they are usually fed 
with the same food as adults — that is, with anything on the table. 
This principle is not scientific. The food for the next few years 
should be selected from a list such as the following: Bread, oatmeal, 
potatoes; milk, cream, milk-puddings; meat, varying in amount 
according to age, such as tender beef, mutton, chicken, rabbit; the 
lighter kinds of fish; eggs, boiled or poached; broth in which vege- 
tables have been boiled; boiled tender vegetables; cooked apples, 
rhubarb, strawberries, plums (free from skin), prunes; uncooked 
fniit, such as oranges, strawberries, apples, bananas. Children 
require plenty to drink, which may consist of milk, milk and water, 
and plain or distilled water; weak tea or cocoa may be allowed 
after four or five years of age. 

The food should not be monotonous; frequent changes are 
salutary. Bread should be light and porous, one day old ; new bread 
or cakes should be eschewed. Sweet cakes and rich puddings 
upset the alimentar}' functions and cause " night terrors." Lean 
ham or bacon, corned beef, dried beef, pork, veal, liver, kidneys, 
goose, duck, and the dressings (forcemeat) from such foods, ought 



1 66

not to be given to cliildren. Heavy vegetables, such as turnips, 
ruta-baga, Jerusalem artichokes, dried peas or beans, celery, 
radishes, and cucumber, should not be allowed to young children. 
Erroneous ideas prevail as to the amount of meat required by 
children; nurses and mothers seldom give them enough. It is 
absolutely essential for them to have plenty of protein to supply 
the materials for growth; an abundance of fat and carbohydrate 
are equally necessary to supply the carbon oxidized in their great 
metabolic activity. The following table by Somnierfield shows the 
amount of food required at various ages:

If a sufficiency of protein is given to a healthy child, we may 
safely leave the amount of other items to them. Children digest 
quickly; their respiratory activity is very great even when the body 
is at rest. For these reasons- the supply of bread-and-butter, or 
other fat, jam, marmalade, syrup, or honey, should be unlimited, 
leaving if possible their appetite alone as a safe guide to their bodily 
requirements. 

Food in Sickness.— Many observations on the metabolism in sick 
children were made by Baginsky. For dietetic purposes he divided 
them into the following groups: (i) Convalescents from severe 
illness, afebrile diseases, chronic diseases in W'hich over-nutrition is 
desirable; (2) diseases in which there is a moderate rise of tempera- 
ture, and the beginning of convalescence; (3) febrile diseases in 
which liquid food is necessary. His observations led him to 
formulate the following requirements:

The only disagreement we find with this table is with the small 
amount of carbohydrate. The tissues are rapidly wasted in febrile

diseases, and it is rational to make use of the protecting influence 
of carboliydrate, especially sugar, to check this waste as much as 
possible. Let us see how far the dietaries of children's hospitals 
agree with his chart. 

1. Milk Diet contains 2 pints of milk, 6 ounces of bread, i ounce 
of butter, 3^ ounces of rice pudding ; the equivalent of 6o-8 grammes 
of protein, 80 grammes of fat, 160 grammes of carbohydrate, and 
1,162 calories of energy. It is sufficient for a child of two to five 
years in Group i ; if the bread is boiled in the milk, it would do for 
any child over eighteen months old. 

2. Broth Diet includes h pint of mutton broth, i^ pints of milk, 
7 i ounces of bread, r ounce of butter, and is equivalent to 62 grammes 
of protein, 55 grammes of fat, 138 granuiies of carbohydrate, and 
1,344 calories. It is suitable for a child of four or five years, or even 
up to eight years, in Group 3, and with a smaller amount of bread 
for younger children. 

3. Beef-Tea Diet contains 13 ounces of beef-tea, i| pints of milk, 
5 ounces of bread, i ounce of butter, and includes 67 grammes of 
protein, 60 grammes of fat, 112 grammes of carbohydrate, and 
1,296 calories. 

4. Fish Diet contains 2| ounces sole, plaice, or other white fish, 
3^ ounces of potato, bread 8 ounces, butter i ounce, or treacle 
2 ounces, milk i pint (or milk | pint and cocoa | pint). It contains 
50 grammes of protein, 50 grammes of fat, and 204 grammes of 
of carbohydrate, yielding 1,534 calories. It is suitable for the 
beginning of convalescence in children from five to twelve. 

5. Meat Diet contains 2J ounces of meat, 4 ounces of potato, 
6h ounces of bread, i| ounces of butter or dripping, and i pint of 
milk (or |- pint of milk and h pint of cocoa). The contents are 
58 grammes of protein, 73 grammes of fat, 178 grammes of carbo- 
hydrate, and 1,645 calories. It is suitable for children during 
convalescence or chronic diseases up to nine years of age. For 
calculating other dietaries the following figures may be used:

CHAPTER \ I 

THE FOOD IN OLD AGE 

VouTii is the period of transition from infancy to maturity*, old 
age of transition from maturity to decay. In early life the physio- 
logical powers are directed to building up the organism and the 
development of its different functions. An abundant supply of 
food is required for these operations; the intake of food exceeds 
the amount of the excreta, the supply exceeds the losses, and the 
body increases in size. In this active period the worn-out cells 
are regenerated easily and quickly; the growth of new cells exceeds 
the decay of effete ones. In the course of time, however, the 
processes of decay and reparation are exactly balanced; the body 
ceases to grow in size: it has reached maturity. In the normal 
condition of things this balance is maintained for many years. 
But ultimately a period arrives when the balance begins to incline; 
the powers of the system are unequal to the demands upon them ; 
the activity of the cellular elements diminishes; the renovation of 
decayed cells is not so rapid ; there is a diminution in bodily energy; 
the waste of the body exceeds the supply. In proportion, however, 
as physiological renovation is less active. Nature economizes the 
use of material, the resources of the system are husbanded with 
greater care, and the functions appear to go on for a long time 
without apparent alteration. Nevertheless, changes are going on 
which are insidious but no less real. Old age comes upon us by 
slow and imperceptible degrees, and Nature kindly smooths the 
path along which we descend, and conducts us by easy stages to 
our destined place of repose. 

Although the powers of the constitution become enfeebled by age, 
and the physiological functions are less vigorously performed, yet, 
if the body be in a healthy condition, they must be considered as 
normally fulfilling the designs of Nature in the later stages of 
existence. There is, however, a material difference between the 
health of youth and the health of old age. In the former the 
vitality is greater, the recuperative powers more efficient; the 
organism rebounds with surprising elasticity from the depression 
of a severe illness. In the latter vitality is more feeble, the con- 
stitution is not so resilient, the spring no longer reacts with a force 
equal to that with which it is extended; the recuperative power is 
deficient ; the body is incapable of doing the same amount of work. 
Slight deviations from the normal performance of function occur, 
which may, however, for a long time be imperceptible. But 

1 68 



CHANGES TN OLD AGE 169 

gradually these increase in extent until they become manifest 
indications of a failure of the Iwdily powers or of disordered health. 
Excitement or exertion, formerly harmless, is not so well borne 
Slight causes are followed by effects somewhat out of proportion 
to the cause ; exhaustion is out of proportion to the work performed ; 
a chill produces serious effects. Among the numerous indications 
of a wavering metabolic balance and disturbance of the functions 
incident to the decline of life arc symptoms of disorder in the 
alimentary system. The principal of these is undoubtedly the 
gradual decline of muscular power which pervades the whole system. 
In this decline the muscular fibres of the stomach and bowels must 
necessarily participate. . But it often happens that while the powers 
of digestion and assimilation diminish, the appetite remains good, 
and consequently more food is consumed than can be digested and 
absorbed. The unabsorbed portion tends to undergo fermentation, 
to produce distension of the stomach and bowels by flatus, to cause 
irritation by the production of acids and toxins, to give rise to 
lu'pertonus of the bloodvessels, to lay the foundations of a vitiated 
habit, and of permanent injury to the tone of various organs. 
There is frequently a change in the action of the bowels; some of 
those people who were subject to constipation in adult life become 
loose, and vice versa. In the one case this is owing to irritation by 
undigested food, and the other to sluggishness in the peristaltic 
action of the bowels. The heart partakes of the same or similar 
changes; the muscular tone of the organ becomes low^ered, in some 
cases leading to cardiac dilatation, hypotonus of the bloodvessels, 
to hepatic hyper?emia, and catarrh of the stomach and bowels from 
venous congestion. In other cases the muscular tone of the heart 
is perhaps exaggerated, owing to hypertonus of the bloodvessels, 
to atheroma, calcification, or other changes therein, in consequence 
of which the cardiac muscle becomes hypertrophied to overcome the 
increased resistance to the circulating fluids. The failure of energy 
also shows itself by an alteration of the cerebral faculties, by in- 
creasing listlessness and lethargy, heaviness and somnolence, failure 
of mental power, confusion of thought, and loss of memory. 

The pathological changes incident to age have been summed up 
by Metchnikoff as a sclerosis which may affect the brain, liver, 
kidneys, and other organs, but is mostly seen in the bloodvessels. 
The bones grow thin and brittle with advancing age, the tissues 
atrophy and become replaced by h3^pertrophied connective tissue, 
especially visible in the arteries." In the brain and nerves, the cells 
which perform motor, sensory, and intellectual functions give place 
to lower or neuroglia cells. The liver cells recede before the invasion 
of connective-tissue cells. A similar condition takes place in the 
kidneys and other organs. In short, old age is a struggle between 
the proper functional cells of the organs and the simple connective- 
tissue elements, and the latter are the conquerors. Phagocytes, too, 
aid in the process, as is seen in the whitening of the hair. Normal 
hair is full of pigment, but at a certain period the cells of the medulla 



i-o THF. FOOD /.V OLD AGE 

hooomo active, and devour the pigment granules witliin reach, and 
so the liair, robbed of colour, gives the first manifestation of age. 
The increasing porosity of the bones is likewise due to the absorption 
of the osseous lamella; by phagocytes. 

All these variations and changes lead to a consideration in the 
minds of those who have most carefull}' watched the progressive 
deterioration of the organism in old age, whether something cannot 
be dene to strengthen the most valuable cellular elements on the 
one hand, and weaken the phagocytes on the other. But the 
problem is not j'et solved. It is our place to consider the amount 
and quality of the food which should be consumed. It is generally 
recognized that the food requirements are varied by age, sex, 
occupation , and other circumstances of the individual. The influence 
of many of these circumstances upon food requirement has already 
been considered. It now remains to be seen to what extent the 
food requires modification in old age. The subject has been con- 
sidered b}" many ^^Titers from the early ages downwards. 

Celsus, in the first book " De re Medica," gives excellent advice 
regarding food and exercise for the strong and weak applicable to 
the aged. He saj^s it behoves a person to pass a diversified kind 
of life; indolence enervates, labour strengthens the body; the former 
brings on premature old age, the latter produces a prolonged period 
of youth. Exercise should precede a meal, stronger in him who 
has laboured, more gentle in him who is fatigued. He advises his 
subject to avoid no kind of food which people use; to take food 
twice a day, provided he can digest it. Bodies which are high fed 
speedily grow old and fall sick. Too much overloading of the stomach 
is never proper, too much abstinence is injurious; if there is any 
intemperance it is safer in drink than in food. All seasoned things 
are injurious. Moderation is the keynote of his recommendations. 

Cornaro, an Italian, published a treatise on " Temperance and 
Sobrietie " in 1558, wherein he states that after living a hfe of 
excesses of all kinds he became every ill, and as a consequence of 
advice, began to observe great moderation in eating, drinking, and 
other things. He gave up his former excesses, regained his health, 
and in consequence of regularit}^ and careful feeding lived to a 
great age. He did not state the amount of food he consumed 
daily, but he so clearly recognized that the food requirements 
diminish as a person grows old, that it is fair to presume that he 
arranged his dietar}^ in accordance with his views. In one of his 
essays he says that as he advanced in years and lost vigour, he felt 
that he ought to lessen rather than increase the amount of his food. 
He appears to have taken everything which agreed with him, and 
nothing which did not. He states that, when seventy-eight or 
seventy-nine 3-ears of age, his daily diet consisted of 12 ounces of 
bread, with meat, yolk of eggs, meat-broth, and 12 ounces of wine.'' 

^ A diet of 12 ounces bread, 3 egg yolks, 3^ ounces of meat, and 12 ounces 
of wine, would contain about 65 grammes of protein and yield 1,360 calories. 
The bulk of the food is small, and the amount of animal substance would 
not be considered large.

FOOD FOR AGF.D PFOPLF 



17T 



He tloes not say if these are the amounts he consumed in the 
earher period (sixty-live to seventy-five years). When he was 
eighty-six years of age he mentions bread, porridge, broth, eggs, 
veal, mutton, kid, poultry, wild birds, and fish, among the articles 
which he consumed. He paid great attention to exercise in the 
open air, to the hours of sleep, to wholesome pleasures, and all other 
things which are important to the maintenance of health. 

Lescius, who wrote in 1634 on the " Right Course of Preserving 
Life and Health unto Extreme Old Age," held similar views on the 
requirements of food in later life. He states that the amount of 
food required is largely determined by labour, and as old people do 
less work than in early adult or middle hfe, they require less food. 
In his opinion the daily food of aged persons should not exceed 
12 or 14 ounces, and should consist of bread, meat, eggs, and 
similar foods. 

Boerhaave, in his aphorisms on the knowledge and cure of 
diseases, constantly recommended moderation when writing of 
aged persons. Indeed, moderation is the keynote of all the ancient 
authorities when writing of aged people. 

Among more recent writers, Voit,^ who bases his observations 
on investigations made by Forster, considered that the conditions 
of old age indicate a ration of o-8 the value of that for men and 
women of mature age, in good health, and doing moderate work. 
In other words, the food should contain —

In this standard, however, no age is stated, and the amount of 
protein is considered by some authorities too great. Apart from 
theoretical considerations, it is a fact that as age advances and 
bodily exercise diminishes, the standard of food requirement also 
diminishes. This fact is recognized by Maurel,- who states that 
as age increases the amount of external muscular work performed 
is smaller, the internal muscular work is decreased, and conse- 
quently the nutritive requirements per kilogramme of body is corre- 
spondingly decreased. He made valuable observations from his 
own clinical experience and the experiments of others, from w^hich 
he concluded that bodily requirement decreases progressively. 
Thus he estimated that a healthy man or woman in middle life 
requires 1-5 grammes of protein and 35 to 38 calories of energy

l>er kilogramme of body- weight, to maintain the organism in equi- 
librium when no work is being performed, and that any muscular 
work must be met by an increased supply of nutriment. From this 
estimate he framed the following maintenance ration for adults:

He divides old age into several periods; the first period of decline 
being from fifty to seventy years, when he considers the body will 
be maintained in equilibrium by the supply, 1-25 grammes of 
protein and 30 to 35 calories of energy per kilo; in the second 
period of decline, seventy years and over, i-o gramme of protein 
and 25 to 30 calories; and in the third period, or extreme old age, 
the demand falls still more, 075 gramme of protein and 20 to 25 
calories of energy will suffice. These may be tabulated as follows:

the average weight of old men and women to be the same as found 
by Quatelet,^ has framed the following table to show the estimated

There is a considerable difterence between the maintenance 
requirements according to Maurel and the amount considered 
necessary by Voit. It should be noted again, however, that 
Maurel's figures are for maintenance only and not for work, and 
when external muscular work has to be performed, ])rovision has to 
be made for it by increasing the ration. Many old people, and 
even those who have to arrange dietaries for them, do not recognize 
the decrease in weight as a factor influencing the amount of food 
required. But bodily weight as well as bodily activity diminishes 
with increasing age, and these together reduce the actual require- 
ment of food. On the other hand, people who are unable any 
longer to employ themselves in bodily occupations and pleasures 
often find enjoyment in ministering to the pleasures of the palate. 
This is not altogether profitable to them; all who have considered 
the subject find that the most long-lived subjects have rarely been 
big feeders, and especially so with regard to animal food. But 
many old people are really big eaters considering their inactivity. 
It would be well therefore to compare Maurel's estimate of require- 
ments with the amount of food actually consumed by old people. 
Fenger^ made a study of the food consumed by a woman, aged 
sixty-one years, which she chose herself, and which seemed enough 
for her. There were four diets:

in 1907 a study was made of the food consumed in a Home for 
Old Ladies in Philadelphia.' There were 113 women: 10 from 
sixty-five to seventy 3'ears old, 73 from seventy to eighty years old, 
JO from eighty to ninety 3'ears old, and 10 from ninety to one 
hundred years old. Tlie amount of food supplied was unlimited, 
appetizing, and presumably satisfied their hunger. A study 
extending over seven days, showed that the food consumed aver- 
aged 58 grammes of protein, 83 grammes of fat, 222 grammes of 
carbohydrate, and 1,882 calories of energ}', per woman. It con- 
sisted of a variety of meat, fish, bacon, eggs, butter, milk, cheese, 
bread, rolls, breakfast foods, oatmeal, cornmeal, macaroni, rice, 
corn-starch, sugar, beans, potatoes, green vegetables, and fresh 
fruit. The food was adequate, well prepared, and cost eighteen 
cents per day. Reckoning the average age at seventy-six years, 
the amount of protein is somewhat below the requirement according 
to Maurel's standard. 

A dietary study in a Baltimore home for aged women included 
an investigation of the food of seventy-five women whose average age 
was seventy-six years. The food consumed by them included 
85 grammes of protein, and was calculated to yield 2,606 calories. 
This is almost identical with the standard which hitherto has been 
considered necessary — viz., o-8 of the food of a man doing moderate 
work. In the adjoining home for aged men there were forty-one 
inmates, whose age is not stated. They served themselves from food 
placed upon the table, the bread being unlimited. The average 
amount consumed during the study included 82-5 grammes of 
protein and 2,339 calories. As this amount is sliglitly below the 
standard set for women, the natural conclusion is that 85 grammes 
of protein is sufficient for men in the decline of life. 

In the German Home for Aged People in Baltimore in 1906 there 
were sixty-five men and women whose a^'erage age was seventy- 
eight j^ears; the average weight of eighteen men being i/)5^ pounds 
and of twenty-nine women 137 pounds. A dietary study extending 
over one week showed that the protein and fuel value of the food 
consumed was 73-5 grammes of protein and 2,225 calories. This is 
practically identical with the standard for fuel-value, but was below

the 85 grainines ul prutciii called lor b}' the same slaiidartl. J he 
inmates were not restricted in the amount consumed, but could 
have eaten more if they wished to do so. As the women are 
assumed to have consumed o-8 as much as the men, the dietary 
suggests that persons of extreme age can be comfortably fed and 
well nourished on less than 85 grammes of protein per day. The 
cost of the food was tweh'e cents per day, although 50 grammes of 
the protein consumed daily was supplied by animal food. 

Guriev of St. Petersburg undertook some experiments to ascertain 
the amount of protein required by old people, and to study the 
metabolism of nitrogen. Five men were selected from sixty-eight 
to eighty-eight years of age; the three younger were hale and hearty; 
the two elder somewhat decrepit. Two dietaries were given in each 
case, the lirst including m .-at and milk, the second beef-tea, but no 
meat or milk. The dietaries and nitrogen balance are given in the 
table on p. 176. 

The conclusions drawn from the observations arc — (i) lliaL the 
amount of protein ordinarily consumed by old men may be dimin- 
ished if an abundance of fat and carbohydrate is taken to replace 
it. (2) The assimilaiion of nitrogen by old men is somewhat less 
than normal; during the first dietary the assimilation of nitrogen 
averaged 9i"i5 per cent.; in the second diet period, 85-17 per cent. 
The assimilation of nitrogen by young men on a similar diet was 
found by Jarwen to be 94 per cent. In the first, or meat period, 
the ratio of incompletely oxidized products to urea in the urine was 
greater than normal ; therefore the metabolism is inferior to that of 
young men on a similar diet. In the second, or non-meat period, 
this ratio decreased somewhat. When the diet contained less 
protein but an abundance of fat, the subjects maintained their usual 
weight and health. 

In connection with metabolism in old persons, the studies of 
Sonden and Tigerstedt ^ may be referred to. These studies with a 
respiration apparatus showed that old men and women excrete a 
smaller amount of carbon dioxide per square metre of surface area 
than middle-aged or young persons. This is considered a proof that 
the metabolism is less active as age advances. In youth the 
amount of COg excreted per kilo of body-weight and per square 
metre of surface area is greater in males than in females. As 
age advances, this difference gradually diminishes, and in old 
age there is practically no difference between the sexes in this 
respect. 

We have previously stated that Voit estabHshed the standard of 
requirements for an old man doing no work at 90 grammes of pro- 
tein, and for an old woman as 80 grammes of protein, per day. In 
the Baltimore houses for the aged, the food consumed dail}' pro- 
vided 85 grammes daily, except in one institution, where the diet 
only contained 74 granmies of protein dailj^ As all the inmates 
seemed satisfied, in good health, and well nourished, the natural

inferencu is that these amounts are ample for tlie nutrition of 
persons in extreme oUl age and having comparatively little to do. 
The example of the Philadelphia Home for Aged Women, however, 
supports the contention of Maurel that less than the above amount 
is necessary to maintain old people, whose muscular activity is slight, 
in good state of nutrition. Langworthy^ sums up the American 
investigation by saying that on the basis of the experimental studies 
in the Homes and other available data, " it seems fair to ])ropose 
0-9 as the factor representing the proportion of protein and energy 
required in old age by a man or woman as compared with a man 
at moderate muscular work during full vigour, and 07 or o-8 as 
the factor representing the relative requirement for extreme old 
age." The facts elicited by these studies do not sustain the 
assumption that the food requirements of old women are only 
o 8 that of men of the same age and activity, but suggest that 
the food required in extreme old age by both sexes is more or less 
identical. 

It cannot be gainsaid, however, that in private life many thou- 
sands of old persons, even when they have a choice of food, do not 
consume so much as 80 or 90 grammes of protein per day. It has 
been shown by Chittenden and others that far less than that would 
be a good provision for persons in middle life who did not have to 
work very hard. The amount of nitrogen excreted daily during a 
period of starvation is about 7-0 or 7*5 grammes, equivalent to. 
45 grammes of protein, which is practically the same as Maurel's 
maintenance ration for a man of 80 years of age. Anything above 
that amount may be considered as being for the purpose of keeping 
the organism in " condition." It is a fact that people whose regular 
consumption of animal food is very low are not usually strong and 
healthy, but are weak, delicate, and predisposed to many diseases; 
whereas a person who consumes a fair amount of animal food is 
usually hale and hearty, and not predisposed to many diseases. An 
excessive consumption of animal food, on the other hand, tends to 
protein decomposition, intestinal auto-intoxication, hypertonus of 
the arteries, and other pathological conditions which shorten the 
days of the consumer. It has long since been stated that no long- 
lived person is a large consumer of meat; on the other hand, that a 
small consumption of meat tends to longevity, providing the amount 
consumed does not fall so low as the amount of protein disintegrated 
and excreted during starvation. 

As an example of low })rotein consumption a case investigated by 
Buys may be quoted. The subject was a man aged sixty years, 
who worked in a factory ten to twelve hours a day. He had never 
been a large consumer of meat ; indeed, from twenty years of age 
he had lived upon a diet consisting of bread, butter, potatoes, vege- 
tables, and very httle meat. His weight at the time of the investi- 
gation was 70 kilos. The diet during the experiment contained 
from 45 to 52 grammes of protein, and yielded only 1,600 calories.

From observations made by myself amongst old people of the 
middle and working classes, I find that it is not uncommon for old 
people, whose food is unlimited, to consume as little as 50 or 60 
grammes of protein daily and to continue in a fair state of health.

Campbell^ says: "The physiological arguments in favour of the 
aged living on a spare diet seem to me to be unmistakable; in fact, 
mere common sense. In old age the active cells atrophy — e.g., epi- 
thelial — while there is an overgrowth of comparatively inert fibrous 
tissue; and pari passu with these retrograde changes there is a 
general depression in the sphere of vital activity. The vital fire no

l8o THE FOOD TN OLD AGE 

longer blazes as in tlie period of lusty youth and prime, but rather 
smoulders and flickers. Hence, the furnace, as represented b}- the 
tissues, requires less fuel in the shape of food than in earlier years. 
Not onlv so, the atrophied digestive glands are less capable of 
dealing with food, and the excretory glands are less able to rid the 
system of the waste products to which it gives rise. ... I find that 
the healthiest, happiest, and longest lived old people are spare 
eaters. 

" A generous diet may be indicated in the old in certain cases-^ 
e.g., I should not hesitate to increase cautiouslj', even to generous 
proportions, the diet of a starved, anaemic, old man with a low 
arterial pressure. There are aged persons whose metabolism has 
for years been habituated to an excess of stimulating diet, and for 
whom it is not always wise to reduce the quantity' of food to slender 
proportions. There are, indeed, exceptional cases of old people 
consuming enormous quantities of food without apparent harm. 
This shows how difficult it is to dogmatize. There are, however, 
rules which, although they are not universally applicable, are yet 
applicable to the generality of cases. Such a principle is set forth 
in the aphorism : Let the diet of the aged be spare ! I believe this 
to be wise counsel, dictated" by common sense, sanctioned by 
tradition, and justified by experience." 

Writing later, CampbelU still holds the same views, but gives an 
extended account of them. He gives the dietary of one of the 
large London workhouses. The food for men over sixty years of 
age consists of 20 ounces of bread, i ounce of margarine, i ounce of 
sugar, 4 ounces of meat, 8 ounces of potato, and 4 ounces of green 
vegetables a day; pudding once a week, stewed fruit twice a week; 
2 pints of tea a day. This supplies 79 grammes of protein and 
2,340 calories. He says this is "an ample allowance, probably in 
excess of actual requirements. Nevertheless most of the inmates, 
even the very old ones, consume the whole of their portion, and 
appear to enjoy it thoroughly. ... It is noteworthy that these 
old people complain very little of indigestion, and, what is even 
more surprising, suffer little from constipation." 

" An inquiry at several workhouses shows that the appetite for 
plain food may last to extreme old age, and their dietetic instincts 
are much the same as those of their younger companions. . . . 
Perhaps the most notable change which the dietetic instinct under- 
goes with advancing years is expressed by the gradual curtailment 
of starchy and sugary foods. . . . The factor of idiosyncrasy is 
an important one. Individuals differ greatly, quite irrespective 
of age, in their digestive and metabolic capacities. We meet with 
children who are quite unable to tolerate foods which old people 
can digest quite easily; and, again, with others who are made ill 
by a slight excess, while their grandparents can perhaps consume a 
large excess with comparative impunity. Some old people have 
prodigious powers of digestion and metabolism. . . . Most of

TiroMPSON ON 01.1) AGE i8i 

these old people, however, would doubtless enjoy better health on a 
more abstemious diet ; nevertheless in regulating their food we 
must make due allowance for their prodigious powers. . . . 
Making due allowance for the personal element, our rule obtains 
that while all shouUl endeavour to conform as far as possible to the 
ideal dietary, allowing themselves no more than an occasional 
excess, it becomes with advancing years increasingly necessary 
for the majority of people to cat moderately of simple foods, and 
not to swallow starchy foods without having first insalivated them 
thoroughly. If we add to these rules the further ones that old 
people should take full advantage of dental surgery, that in the 
case of the toothless certain of the tougher varieties of food should 
be broken up mechanically before being taken, and finally that due 
regard should be had to the influence of idiosyncrasy and habit, we 
have said all that is worth saying concerning the diet of the aged." 
Sir Henry Thompson' says: " As we increase in age— when we 
have spent, say, our first half-century — less energy and activity 
remain, and less expenditure can be made ; less power to eliminate is 
possible at fifty than at thirty, and still less at sixty and upward. 
Less nutriment, therefore, must be taken in proportion as age 
advances, or, rather, activity diminishes, or the individual will 
suffer. If he continues to consume the same abundant breakfasts, 
substantial lunches, and heavy dinners, which at the summit of 
his power he could dispose of with impunity, he will in time either 
accumulate fat or become acquainted with gout, or rheumatism, 
or show signs of unhealthy deposit in some part of the body . . . 
which must inevitably empoison, undemiine, or shorten the 
remaining tenn of his life. He must reduce his ' intake ' because a 
smaller expenditure is an enforced condition of his existence. At 
seventy the man's power has further diminished, and the nutriment 
must correspond thereto if he desires still another term of comfort- 
able life. And why should he not ? Then at eighty, with less 
activity, there must be still less ' support.' " He recommends 
special attention to be paid to moderate exercise in the open air ; 
and he advises a dietary which can be varied according to the 
idiosyncrasies of the individual, including four small meals a day — 
namely, breakfast about half-past eight, luncheon about one, dinner 
at seven, and a light supper at about eleven. The animal food for 
breakfast and luncheon includes egg or fish. A little meat or fowl 
may be taken at luncheon, unless it is preferred to reserve them for 
dinner, in which case fish and a farinaceous pudding may be substi- 
tuted. The dinner should consist of a little consomme, puree of 
fish or soup, a little fowl or game, a dish of vegetables, and some 
light farinaceous pudding with or without fruit. The light supper, 
intended to promote sleep, should consist of 4 or 5 ounces of 
consomme, with an ounce of thin toasted bread. He says all bread 
should be toasted, and the amount for each meal should be 
3 to 5 ounces before it is toasted. Butter should form a part of all 

' " Diet in Relation to Age and Activity," 1902. 



182 THE FOOD IN OLD AGE 

meals, and 3 or 4 ounces should be consumed daily, including that 
used in cooking. The beverages should consist of weak tea or 
coffee, with milk and aerated distilled water. 

It is impossible to lay down any fixed rules for attaining longevity. 
It is absolutely certain, however, that heredit\' is a great factor in 
attaining it. To be born of long-lived parents, to have had grand- 
parents who have lived to a great age, is one of the most important 
items in the consideration. Another important rule is to reduce 
the amount of animal food consumed. This rule is not agreed to by 
all investigators, but in most cases it is advisable to reduce the 
amount of animal food to one-half of that consimied by people in 
middle hfe. Great moderation after sixtj- years of age is an aid to 
longevit}-. It is somethnes difficult to convince people how little 
food is necessary to old age when no active muscular work is being 
perfonned, especialh' in extreme old age, to maintain the body in 
health. Moderation is construed differently by different people. 
Some people think if they abstain from alcohol they may indulge 
freely in meat and other highly nutritious foods. But they cannot 
continue to do so with unpunity, for changes will gradually develop 
in their bloodvessels, or they will suffer from gout, chronic disease 
of the liver, or kidneys. They nmst therefore reduce the amount 
of meat as well as alcohol if they wish to keep their old age free 
from these troubles. Sir Herman Weber ^ says: " Few people know 
how little food is necessary in advanced age to maintain bodily 
health. Few people who live to more than eighty are large eaters 
of meat. ... I have not been able to convince myself that in 
healthy people a fair amount of meat, fish, poultry, or game, 
causes any bad effects. But most people enjoy better health and 
live longer who eat only a little meat and a larger quantity of 
vegetables, to which milk and its preparations may be added. . . . 
The food should not be bolted or moistened with much fluid during 
the meal; but it must be thoroughly masticated and moistened by 
incorporation with the saliva before it is swallowed. Most people 
in advanced age get thinner, and this is decidedly an advantage to 
those who have been corpulent, for by loss of weight they may 
retain their activity longer than they otherwise would do. They 
feel lighter, breathe freer, and may be more energetic. Some old 
people count this loss of weight an evil, and endeavour to remedy 
it by eating more food. But that is wrong; if the person is healthy, 
nothing need be feared from the gradual loss of weight which is 
evident in persons who reach an advanced age. . . . Some men 
retire from business at sixty to sixty-five years of age, and lose their 
grip of life because they take no interest in anything. This is 
wrong. Such men must find an interest in some object — something 
outside themselves; they must keep up a variety in their mental 
occupations, and take an interest in their surroundings, otherwise 
they are likely to become dejected and melancholy, and little things 
may burden and worry them." 

1 Brit. Med. Jour., 1904. 



WEBER ON OLD AGE 183 

He formulated the following rules for prolonging life: 

" Pure air in and out of the house; moderation in eating and 
drinking; keej) all the organs healthy as far as possible; take regular 
exercise out of doors every day in all weathers; go to bed early, rise 
early, sleep eight hours; keep the skin in order; have regular work or 
mental occupation; cultivate a placid, cheerful, hopeful state of 
mind; avoid anodynes, stimulants, excitement, passion, and all 
other injurious agencies." 

Sir James Sawyer recommends: " Eight hours sleep; sleep on the 
right side; keep the bedroom windows open; avoid draughts; take 
a daily bath at the temperature of the body; eat little meat, and that 
well cooked; eat fat to feed the cells which destroy microbes; 
avoid alcohol, which destroys such cells; take daily exercise in the 
open air; exercise before breakfast ; take frequent short holidays; 
limit your ambition; keep your temper." 

Sir B. W. Richardson also gave the following excellent advice: 
" Live on light diet, with milk as the standard food, but varied 
according to the season; take food in moderate quantity four times 
a day, the last being a light meal before going to bed; clothe 
warmly but lightly, so that the body may at all seasons maintain 
its temperature; keep the body in fair exercise, the mind active 
and cheerful; maintain an interest in what is going on in the world, 
and take an active part in reasonable labours and pleasures, as 
though old age were not present; take plenty of sleep during 
sleeping hours; spend nine hours in bed, and take care that the 
temperature of the bedroom is maintained at about 60° F. ; avoid 
passion, excitement, and luxury." 



CHAPTER MI 

SPECIAL DIETS 

The mixed diet has been sulticiently discussed in the foregoing 
pages; but it is requisite that we should consider some of the 
special diets used by persons in health and disease. 

Vegetarianism has the first claim on our attention, because, in 
a pure or modified fonn, it is the dietary of entire races of people, 
whose numbers amount to many millions. Moreover, vege- 
tarianism has been adopted by many Europeans and Americans, 
who find it less costly than ordinary food, or who believe that it is 
conducive to health, longevity, good temper, and a mildness of 
disposition, or who object to eat flesh for aesthetic reasons, and 
consider the slaughter of animals is unjustifiable. 

A pure vegetarian is one who seeks to nourish the body on 
cereals, legumes, nuts, and fruit, without the aid of animal food. 
I\Ian3' vegetarians, however, consume milk, butter, cheese, and 
eggs, and are properly called lacio-vegefarians ; they are really no 
more vegetarians than the man who eats meat, fish, or fowl. A 
lacto- vegetarian diet — that is, one consisting of milk, cheese, butter, 
eggs, cereals, legumes, fruit, nuts, and other vegetables — is advan- 
tageous to many people, and especiall}^ as a temporary diet in the 
treatment of disease. One of the chief advantages is the relative 
starvation which occurs in comparison with that resulting from 
the consumption of an equal bulk of mixed food. While getting 
a fairlj' bulky meal he no longer overeats. The amount of protein 
consumed is smaller, and the proportion absorbed from a vege- 
tarian diet is considerably less than from a mixed diet. This is an 
advantage to man\' patients, and a course of lacto-vegetarian 
dietary such as the following is exceedingly useful in the state of 
high arterial tension which precedes arterio-sclerosis, some forms 
of renal disease — e.g., Bright's disease — Graves's disease, gout, 
gravel, chronic rheumatism, liver trouble, constipation, intestinal 
fermentations, auto-intoxication, skin diseases — e.g., chronic urti- 
caria and psoriasis — neurasthenia, neuralgia, sciatica, cardiac and 
gastric neuroses, etc. A pure vegetarian diet is good for some of 
the jjatients; for others a lacto-vegetarian diet is better. 

Lacto-Vegetarian Diet. 

Breakfast. — Milk, wholemeal bread, butter, one egg. 

Midday. — Baked beans and tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage, stewed fruit, 
bread, cheese, and salad. 

Evening. — Lentil soup or oatmeal porridge, bread-and-butter, dates and 
walnuts, or grapes and bananas.

VEGETARIANISM i^5 

The dietary can be varied in an infinite variety of ways. The 
use of sauces of various kinds, walnut ketchup, mushroom ketchup, 
fresh nuishrooms or tomatoes, with beans or macaroni, gives pala- 
tabihty to the meal, and provokes a secretion of gastric juice. 
Peas boiled with pot-herbs, mint, thyme, savoury, marjoram, 
endive, etc., are better flavoured than when boiled alone. Ihe 
midday meal is generally that which is found most difficult to 
provide. The following examples of vegetarian dinners are sufficient 
for a week: 

Sunday. — -Savoury pie, consisting of steamed haricot beans and vegetables; 
or macaroni and eggs, moistened with milk and seasoned; baked potatoes; 
tomatoes and salad; ground rice, blancmange; fruit. 

Monday. — Steamed rice and tomatoes, with grated cheese; boiled cabbage 
or other green vegetable; wholemeal biscuits; custard pudding. 

Tuesday. — Steamed broad beans and macaroni, with parsley sauce; steamed 
green vegetables; potatoes cooked in their skins. 

Wednesday. — Xut-roast, mushroom gravy; steamed vegetables; plain 
steamed pudding with jam or syrup. 

Thursday. — ISIacaroni and cheese, with apple sauce and steamed potatoes; 
ginger pudding; fruit. 

Friday. — Baked Irish stew, containing nut-meal or peas or beans in place 
of meat; milk pudding; unfcrmented bread; cheese. 

Saturday. — Lentil-roast with apple sauce or gravy; boiled cabbage; 
baked or steamed potatoes; maizene pudding; nuts and fruit. 

Further information on the subject can be obtained from 
Broadbent's " Forty Vegetarian Dinners" or Bardsley's " Recipes 
for Food Reformers." It may at once be granted that the com- 
position of milk, cheese, eggs, nuts, peas, and beans, is a sufficient 
warrant for their use in place of meat ; hut the matter does not end 
tliere. Universal lacto- vegetarianism is an impossibility. " Carried 
out to its logical conclusion, it would have a most profound effect 
on life generally. Under such a scheme of diet, all animals, except 
those used for draught purposes and pleasure, would be gradually 
abolished. Were fowls used only to supply eggs and feathers, the 
price of eggs would rise considerably. The supply of milk would 
be insufficient and its price prohibitive, for cattle could not be kept 
for the milk and leather alone. Woollen clothing would become 
the luxury of the rich. The bulk of grass would be absolutely 
wasted, ^^'e should be dependent on cotton and linen for clothing, 
and compressed cellulose for boots and many other articles." ^ 
Before entering upon the subject of metabolism and digestion 
with the vegetarian diet, it may be as well to answer one or two 
of the assertions of vegetarians. 

It is sometimes asserted that vegetarianism leads to mildness of 
temper or a gentle disposition. This is scarcely likely from a com- 
parison of the animals. The buffalo, the rhinoceros, and the 
Chinese pirate, all vegetarians, arc equally remarkable for their 
cunning and ferocity. The carnivora are more active and alert 
than herbivora. The meat-eating races of man are physically 

1 lulmund Cautley in Sutherland's "System of Diet and Dietetics," p. 197. 



l86 SPECIAL DIETS 

superior to those whose food is chiefly vegetarian. The superior 
physique of the European or American soldier over that of the 
Japanese or Hindu is obvious. The nieat-cating races of mankind 
are more progressive than the vegetarian races. The Japanese 
ha\'e progressed enomiousl}^ since the adoption of a larger protein 
ration, and especially since they took more flesh. The same remark 
applies to the Chinese, Siamese, and Burmese. Sulticicnt has been 
said under the head of Food in Relation to Intellectual Work to 
show that this influence is largely a matter of digestion. But it 
cannot be gainsaid that animal food is more stimulating than 
vegetable food, metabolism is provoked, and life is urged on more 
rapidly by it. The influence of vegetarian diet, therefore, is to slow 
down man}- of the vital processes, to make the person if anything 
less energetic, or of a quieter disposition only in proportion as all 
his functions become somewhat more languid. That animal food 
is proper for children is suggested by the fact that milk is the 
rjatural food of infants and young children. It may be admitted 
that less animal food than the amount usually consumed is really 
needed, and it is probable that two-thirds of the amount of protein 
required might be derived from vegetable sources. Hueppe says: 
" Man was originally a mixed feeder, but evolved into a flesh-eater, 
and lastly into a vegetarian; but vegetarianism only became 
possible after the introduction of fire and discovery of the art of 
cooking. ]Man has neither the teeth nor the gut of a vegetarian 
animal, or he would naturalh graze in the fields in the summer, 
and in winter eat oats from a manger." 

There is no advantage whatever in vegetarianism as a source of 
energy. On the contrary, there is a disadvantage owing to the 
vegetarian diet being less easily digested. The same amount of 
energy is expended in the perfomiance of bodily functions, supply 
of heat, or mechanical work, whether the food is a mixed diet, a 
flesh diet, or a vegetarian diet. The same amount of potential 
energy is transfomied into kinetic energj^ to do the same amount 
of work, in the carnivorous dog, the herbivorous buffalo, and 
omnivorous man. The amount of energy expended by man under 
various circumstances has been fully discussed in a previous 
chapter. The energy required can be derived from a pure vege- 
tarian diet providing the amount consumed is sufficient. But a 
vegetarian diet does not appear to give so much strength as a mixed 
diet. No vegetarian animal can lift the weight of his own body, 
not even the horse, ox, camel, or elephant. On the other hand, 
the carnivorous lion, gripping a calf his own weight, can jump a 
hurdle 6 feet high. The lifting power of man, the mixed feeder, 
exceeds that of any other mammal. It is recorded of Louis Cyr 
that he lifted 2,672 pounds; of Little that he carried 1,560 pounds 
for fifteen steps; of a Tyrolese that in six hours he carried a load 
weighing 262 pounds up an ascent 5,000 feet high. A labourer, 
weighing 165 pounds, working in the docks, will many times a day 
carry a sack weighing 220 pounds. 



VEGETARIANISM 187 

A vegetarian diet is not more healthful than an ordinary diet. 
Vegetarians contend that their diet tends to health and longevity. 
First of all, it must be stated that the vegetarian is quite as liable 
to contract disease through his food or to suffer food-poisoning as 
the flesh-eater. The vegetarian urges that meat causes diseases 
of the liver, gout, stone, gravel, chronic rheumatism, skin diseases, 
disturbances of the vascular system, arterio-sclerosis, kidney 
disease, migraine, and kindred ailments; that ptomaine-poisoning 
may follow the consumption of meat; that the animal consumed 
may be the subject of anthrax, pneumonia, tuberculosis, glanders, 
various worms, and other diseases communicable to man; that 
oysters and other shellfish disseminate typhoid fever, and so on. 
But unfortunately quite as man}^ examples can be produced against 
vegetarian diet. An excess of bread or other starchy food from 
the vegetable kingdom produces indigestion, flatulence, acidity, 
congestion of the liver, haemorrhoids, and promotes obesity. Sugar 
has an enonnous value as an energy-provider, but an excess of it 
will produce evils similar to those following an excess of starch, 
and it especially causes catarrh of the stomach, attended by an 
abundant secretion of mucus, which envelops particles of the food, 
and prevents the digestive secretions from getting to and acting 
upon them, thereby causing indigestion and ultimately increasing 
the catarrh and the symptoms attending it. The ingestion of hard 
fruit, nuts, and fibrous vegetables, is a frequent cause of indigestion. 

The communicability of disease is by no means confined to flesh 
foods. The advice of medical practitioners in the tropics is — " Eat 
no uncooked vegetable, nor any raw fruit, unless you can pare it or 
peel it." Enteric fever, dysentery, cholera, diarrhoea, and various 
other diseases have often been traced to a disregard of such advice. 
Even in northerly and temperate climates the consumption of raw, 
unripe, or over-ripe fruit, is a frequent cause of diarrhoea, choleraic 
diarrhoea, and has been blamed for the occasional occurrence of 
tropical diseases in a temperate climate. Neither are vegetables 
free from blame. That terrible disease hydatids is due to the 
TcBuia echinococcus, a minute tapeworm which is taken into the 
body in the fonn of ova or partially developed Tcenia on uncooked 
vegetables, such as watercress, celery, lettuce, etc. Actinomycosis 
is due to the ray fungus which enters the organism with green 
vegetables and cereals. Ergotism, due to the fungus O'tdiiim 
abortifaciens, is a disease which commonly affects the consumers 
of rye-bread. Pellagra has been associated with the consumption 
of maize, and beri-beri with rice. In fact, the superior freedom 
of the vegetarian diet from disease-giving properties vanishes 
entirely when the subject is carefully considered. 

The superior health-giving properties of the vegetarian diet are 
also very questionable. Hueppe says: " The vegetarians of our 
time belong to the class of neurotic men who, failing to meet the 
strain of town life, ever seek for a ' heal-all ' in one or other crank. 
Their doctrines, pushed with fanatic zeal, make no impression on 



188 SPECIAL DIETS 

the healthy, and onl}'' tend to overthrow the balance of others who, 
like themselves, are the victims of unnatural modes of existence." 
The opinion of one who has followed the cult for some years, and 
known many votaries, may also be quoted. Mr. Hector W'aylen^ 
says he was a vegetarian for eight years, wore sandals, and went 
without a hat ; but it gradually dawned upon him that man is 
somewhat different from the beasts; that if a monkey can do some- 
thing, it does not follow that a man should do likewise. He says: 
" \'egetarians as a rule are not healthy folks. They present either 
a wizened and emaciated appearance, or a tendency to fiabbiness. 
They have a poor circulation, and are liable to chills. They suffer 
from dyspepsia, flatulence, bad breath, and ana-mia. Their liver 
and kidneys are common!}' affected, and altogether there is a want 
of vitality among them. . . . The}- burden their stomach with 
masses of crude stuff, and practically deprive themselves of fat and 
oil; and while the\' daily grow thin and nervous, they think they' 
are improving in health." He goes on to remark that when the 
human body is starving it begins to feed upon itself, as a camel 
does on its hump, and vegetarians are thus guilty of a species of 
cannibalism. 

Concerning the necessity for vegetable foods, a great deal can be 
said. There is no doubt that green vegetables and fresh fruit are 
essential to the well-being of all people, but more especially to the 
town-dweller. It is well known that scurvy was an exceedingly 
common aihiient in England up to the seventeenth century, and 
a hea\y mortality was due to that cause. Gardening was then of 
a primitive character; cabbage, lettuce, celery, endive, potatoes, 
green peas, kidney beans, and many other of the vegetables highly 
prized in the present day were scarcely cultivated at all, or 
only in the gardens of the aristocratic houses, although the wild 
plants were used to some extent. Since then, however, horticulture 
has developed into a science, studied and practised by great 
numbers of people ; vegetables now form a constant portion of our 
daily diet, fruit is becoming more and more a recognized part of 
our dietary, and in consequence the ravages of scurvy have become 
almost unknown. Fresh vegetables, potatoes, and fruit, contain 
certain salts which are necessary for the proper constitution of the 
blood and other fluids of the body. If they are withheld from the 
food for a long time, the blood becomes impoverished, and scurvy 
results. While admitting the necessity for vegetables and fruit in 
the diet, we must insist that an exclusive vegetarian diet is incon- 
sistent with the ability of mankind to live upon all kinds of food; 
that vegetable foods alone entail a larger amount of work on the 
digestive organs, and they are not sufficiently stimulating for the 
active exertion which belongs to our present civilized condition. 
However, a vegetarian diet suits some people better than one 
containing meat; there are persons who constantly complain of 
heaviness, drowsiness, and want of energy after a dinner consisting 

' Brit. Med. Jour , 1900, i., 37. 



Vr.GETATUANJSM 189 

of hot meat and the usual accompannuents, who feel light and active 
after a vegetarian meal. It is a fact that the wealthy classes and 
those who have opportunity eat too largely and too frequently of 
meat and game, and consequently they suft'er from diseases which 
are little known among vegetarians. But a vegetarian diet as a 
rule is not more healthy than a mixed diet, nor is it productive of a 
greater duration of life than a mixed diet; on the other hand, the 
cold plain facts of Insurance Companies show that the life of the vege- 
tarians, as illustrated by entire races of people such as Bengalis, is not 
so valuable as that of the average European, who is a mixed feeder. 

Some of the points already mentioned in regard to vegetarianism 
must now be viewed by the light of experiments in feeding and 
metabolism. The breeders of cattle, pigs, horses, and other 
animals have abundantly proved that, for feeding purposes, the 
best proportion of protein to carbohydrate is i : 5. European 
men and women who consume an ordinary mixed diet usually get 
from I : 3 to I : 5; but an Irish peasant gets, or used to get, ten 
times as much carbohydrate as protein — about i : io-6 — and Voit 
found a vegetarian in Mimich whose protein and carbohydrate were 
in the ratio of i : 11. Such a low proportion of protein in the food 
of human beings is responsible for a high death-rate both in the 
young and the old, and in those who are unable to work off the 
excess of carbohydrate by bodily labour. Themixed diet supplies 
37 to 39 calories of energy per kilo of body-weight, and includes 
14 per cent, of protein. The vegetarian diet contains only 6 per 
cent, of protein, but yields 86 calories per kilo of body-weight. 
Hueppe likens the vegetarian to an over-heated steam-engine 
which is in danger of explosion owing to the use of a wrong kind 
of fuel ; his digestion is forced to deal with a far greater bulk of 
food than is necessary, and energy is wasted in its digestion which 
might be used for the higher purposes of mental activity. Only in 
the circumstance of hard manual labour in the open air can a 
purely vegetarian diet be borne. There are, however, large numbers 
of people who live on a more or less vegetarian diet. The Irish 
peasantry live, or used to do, upon a diet consisting largely of 
potatoes, with a little rhilk, eggs, and pork occasionally; replacing 
potatoes bv oatmeal, the list also represents the food of many 
I)oor people in Scotland. The poor of Gemiany and Russia live 
largely upon rve-bread, potatoes, and fat ; in Italy, maize, chestnuts, 
and acorn-meal form an important part of the food of the peasants. 
The poor of India and China live largely on rice, millet, and 
vegetables, with more or less pulse and other legumes. 

As vegetables are the chief source of carbohydrates, a deficiency 
of this group of foodstuffs need not be feared when the diet consists 
wholly or chiefly of vegetables. Carbohydrates are as a rule well 
absorbed, excepting cellulose, although there is a difference in the 
proportion absorbed. Cellulose is not absorbed to any extent in 
the human alimentary canal, although it is absorbed to a con- 
siderable extent by animals. The presence of cellulose in the diet 



igo 



SPECIAL DIETS 



is valuable to many persons l)y acting as a mechanical stimulus to 
peristalsis; in fact, the conclusion has been arrived at that it is an 
essential part of the food of all animals which possess a long intestinal 
canal. The human intestinal canal is, proportionately, not so long 
as that of some herbi\ora, and the presence of cellulose therein has 
some drawbacks, but these are far outweighed by the advantages. 

Deficiency of Fat in Vegetables.^ — A glance at the tables of com- 
position will show that most vegetable foods are markedly deficient 
in fat. Such proportion of fat as is present is usually almost 
completely absorbed. But it should be remembered that a 
deficiency of fat in the body is borne as badly as a deficiency of 
protein. It can be made up to the amount usually consumed in a 
mixed diet by the use of oils, butter, vegetable butter, pea-nut butter, 
cocoanut butter, palm oil, palmine, and other vegetable fats. As 
a general rule these are used to a considerable extent by the vege- 
tarians of Europe and America, especially those who live in the 
large towns and are able to obtain them easily. 

Since the carbohydrates are derived almost entirely from the 
vegetable kingdom, and fat almost equally from the animal and 
vegetable kingdoms, the crux of vegetarianism revolves around the 
protein, and various questions have been asked in connection with 
this subject — e.g.: 

1. Is vegetable protein digested, absorbed, and assimilated as 
well as proteins of animal origin ? 

2. When absorbed into the system, has vegetable protein the 
same nutritive value as absorbed animal protein ? 

3. Has the source of the protein any influence upon the metabo- 
lism and excretion of nitrogen ? 

4. Has the source of the protein any influence upon the develop- 
ment of organs or the performance of their functions ? 

To answer the first question a comparison of the amount absorbed 
from various foods is necessary. To determine the net calorific 
value of the food or its physiological availability, it is necessary 
to subtract from the gross heat value of the food the combustion 
value of the urine and fseces. The following are examples obtained 
b}' Rubner^ in which these points are shown:

Atvvater's coefficients of digestibility (p. 43) are drawn from 
a large number of investigations, many of which may be found 
in the Bulletins issued by the United States Agricultural Depart- 
ment; but a comparison of the proportion of protein in various 
foods and of the amount absorbed from each kind is even more 
valuable for showing the availability of the proteins in such foods. 
The following figures, representing the protein-content of the various

The above table shows plainly that, as a source of protein, meat, 
fish, eggs, and cheese take the highest rank, peas, beans, and nuts 
follow; but bread, rice, vegetables, and fruit contain ver\^ little 
protein. The amount of protein absorbed or available is also 
highest in meat, fish, eggs, milk, and cheese; next to these it is most 
available in macaroni, vermicelli, oatmeal, and maizemeal. The 
protein of nuts follows next in order of availability, especially pea- 
nuts, Brazil nuts, chestnuts, and walnuts; peas, white beans, 
haricot beans, kidney beans, and lentils follow in the order given. 
The protein of fruit and vegetables is quite as easily absorbed as 



iq2 SPECT.U. DIETS 

that of cereals and lei^unies, but they are poor in this important 
element. It remains to be seen what is the amount of protein in the 
dietary of vetjetarians and fruitarians, and to compare tluit '.vith 
the composition of an ordinary- mixed diet. The following table 
shows the average composition of the diet of fifty-three mixed 
feeders, and a selection of dietaries used by vegetarians and fruit- 
arians in various studies. The figures were chief!}' abstracted from 
the excellent study of Fruitarianism b}' Professor Jaffa. ^ 

These dietaries show that, when compared with so-called standard 
dietaries, both the vegetarian and fruitarian diet is lamentably 
deficient in protein and fat, and in some instances was also deficient 
in fuel value, in one case only providing 25-4 calories per kilo of 
body-weight. Tlie examples (see table, p. 193) of vegetarian dietary 
actually consumed are sufficient to show the mode of feeding. 

1. Man, iicoify-cighl years old, height 5 feet 5 inches, weight 
125 poitnds : His daily diet consisted of: Rye-bread [Pumpernickel), 
131 grammes ^4^ ounces) ; Graham bread, 438 grammes (nearly 
I pound) ; apples, 777 grammes (i| pounds) ; dried figs, 114 grammes 
(4 ounces) ; dried dates, 247 grammes (8 ounces) ; oranges, 
66 grammes (2 ounces); olive-oil, 21 grammes (| ounce). It con- 
tained protein, 54 grammes; fat, 22 grammes; carbohydrates, 
573 grammes; and had a heat value of 2,775 calories.^ 

2. Man, forty-eight years old, height 5 feet 8 inches, weight 
153 pounds, consumed daily: Potatoes, 1,000 grammes (2-j pounds) ; 
hazel nuts, 166 grammes (6 ounces); pea-nuts, 12-5 grammes 
(J ounce) ; plums, S^ grammes (3 ounces) ; sugar, 71 grammes 
(2i ounces) ; raisins, 93 grammes (3^ ounces) ; apples, 354 grammes 
(.? pound); oranges, 63 grammes (2i ounces); olive-oil, 50 grammes 
(if ounces). It contained protein, 63 grammes; fat, 66 grammes; 
carbohydrate, 593 grammes; and had a fuel value of 3,302 calories.^ 

3. The following example of a moderate vegetarian diet is given 
by Jaffa.* The subject was a man, aged sixty-four years, height 
5 feet 7 inches, weight 136 pounds ; he had been a vegetarian for 
eleven years. The total food consumed by him during a period of 
twenty- four days was as follows:

5. A Roumanian peasant, living on beans and maize, receives 
daily: Protein, 182 grammes; fat, 93 grammes; carbohydrate, 
968 grammes. 

6. The average diet of a Japanese peasant is estimated to contain — 
Protein, 102 grammes; fat, 17 grammes; carboliydrate, 578 grammes. 
But, according to Mori, the Japanese may be divided into three 
classes: (i) The rural population of the interior eat a vegetable diet 
almost exclusively; they only eat fish once or twice a month, and 
meat once or twice a year. (2) The population of the coasts eat a 
considerable amount of fish. (3) The residents of cities, and wealthy 
families all over Japan, eat both meat and fish to a considerable 
extent. Rice is the principal vegetable food, but in addition to this 
a considerable amount of barley, wheat, millet, and buckwheat are 
eaten Tubers, such as yams and sweet potatoes, and roots, such

VEGETARIANISM 193 

as turnips and radishes, are staple articles of food. Pumpkins, 
cucumbers, and other cucurbits, are much used for food. Legumes 
in their natural condition are not much eaten, but they form the 
basis of a large number of prepared foods and relishes, which are 
eaten by everybody. Chief among these are miso, tofu, and shoyu. 
Miso is a thick paste prepared from cooked soy-beans, which are 
rubbed through a sieve, and fermented witli the same ferment 
which they use for the fermentation of rice-liquor to make wine. 
Tofu is bean cheese ; it consists essentially of the leguniin of soy- 
beans, and is eaten fresh. It is obtained by extraction of the 
cooked soy-beans, rubbed into a paste, with water, and precipitated 
by the addition of mother-liquor obtained from the evaporation of 
sea-water in tlie manufacture of salt. The agent of the precipitation 
is magnesium chloride. Shoyu is a sauce which is extensively used ; 
it is prepared from the soy-bean paste, obtained in the same way 
as that used for making miso, which is mixed with roasted and 
pulverized wheat, wheat-flour, salt, and water, and fennented with 
rice-wine ferment for one and a half to five years. 

7. The Chinese peasantry live in the same way as the Japanese. 
All classes of people use the same or similar preparations of soy- 
bean, and a very large number of those who can afford it eat meat, 
fish, and game, and especially pork. 

The answer to our first question is that the protein of vegetables 
is not digested, absorbed, and assimilated as well as the proteins 
of animal origin. A very much larger proportion of the nitro- 
genous compounds escapes from the influence of the digestive 
ferments, and this is mainly due to the difference in the solubiUty 
of the envelopes of animal and vegetable cells. With a strictly 
vegetarian diet, a very much larger quantity of food must be con- 
sumed to enable the consumer to digest as much protein as is 
usually considered necessary. The question as to whether man- 
kind requires as much protein as that entering into so-called 
standard diets has been previously discussed in the section on the 
protein requirement. To obtain the amount of protein usually 
considered necessary for the organism from a purely vegetarian 
dietary, calls for the expenditure of a good deal more labour by 
the digestive organs than is required for the digestion of an ordinary 
mixed diet. From an economical point of view there is no doubt 
that the protein of legumes is cheaper than that from meat, milk, 
or eggs, and from this standpoint their use must be encouraged 
when the diet is deficient in this constituent owing to a limitation 
of the income. 

Has vegetable protein the same physiological value when absorbed 
as animal protein ? Vegetarians maintain that vegetable proteins 
are specifically different in their action from the animal proteins, 
and that they have a different effect on the body, and also on the 
character and morale. In the present state of our knowledge of the 
breaking down of all food proteins in the process of digestion, it is 
difficult to believe that any minute biological peculiarities pertaining 



196 SPECIAL DIETS 

to the molecules of albumin, globulin, or other protein, are preserved. 
Moreover, the point is not a good one for vegetarians to raise, for 
it is possible that the proteins of animal origin need a less complete 
breaking down than vegetable proteins before they are assimilated. 
Proteins are all composed of amino-acids, and the proteins of 
animal foods have been constructed out of vegetable proteins by 
the consumer. All proteins do not contain the same kinds, or 
perhaps the same proportion of amino-acids, but in many proteins 
it is only the proportion that diflers. There are many minute 
difterences between the various proteins, but the differences arise 
from a variation in the proportion of the amino-acids. So far as 
the amino-acids go, it matters very little where they are obtained 
from, as they have practicallj^ the same value whether they are 
derived from the animal or vegetable kingdom. 

In forming an opinion as to the exact nutritive value of foods 
something more is necessary than a knowledge of the nitrogen 
content. The actual amount of protein in many foods has never 
been accurately determined. It is true the amount of nitrogen 
has been ascertained, and from it the proportion of protein has been 
calculated by the factor X x 6-25 on the assumption that no other 
nitrogen compound is present. Both assumptions are wanting in 
precision. The amount of nitrogen in the numerous proteins of 
animal and vegetable foods differs somewhat, and the chfference is 
from 15-0 to 19-0 per cent., 16 per cent, of nitrogen being the 
average, and therefore the factor varies from N x 5-26 to N x 6-66. 
The assumption that no other nitrogen compounds occur in a great 
proportion holds good in the case of cereals and legumes; but 
other vegetables contain free amino-acids, amides, ammonia, and 
nitrates, the unorganized nitrogen sometimes forming one-third of 
the total nitrogen. It would likewise be an error to consider all 
the nitrogen in meat as contained in proteins, because many animal 
tissues contain materials which yield gelatin, a substance very 
different from albumin or globulin, and more analogous to carbo- 
hydrates than proteins. 

One of the best and surest modes of detemiining the value of 
the nitrogen-content of any foodstuff is by finding out the amount 
of protein absorbed. This has been done in regard to many foods 
named above, and also in metabolism experiments with vegetarians. 
A consideration of such figures shows that there is a great difference 
in the absorption of animal and vegetable foods. In fact, it would 
seem to be almost impossible for a man to consume sufficient 
vegetable food to enable him to absorb 100 grammes of protein 
daily. The potato appears to be especially unsuited to supply 
protein, seeing that 5 kilos of potatoes would have to be consumed 
to take in 100 grammes of protein, and no less than 7 kilos would be 
required to enable 100 grammes of protein to be assimilated. 
Rubner found, however, that a soldier was unable to consume more 
than 3 to 3J kilos daily, although the potatoes were cooked in a 
variety of ways to make them appetizing, and he had perfect liberty 



VEGETARIANISM 197 

to consume them at any time, or to eat them all through the day. 
The amount consumed by this man contained only 71-5 grammes 
in protein, of which 23 grammes was not absorbed, but reappeared 
of his faeces. In his case potatoes were insufticient to maintain 
the nitrogen equilibrium; he excreted more nitrogen through his 
kidne}'s than he absorbed from his alimentary canal — in fact, he 
partly lived upon the proteins of his body. The legumes are better 
adapted to form part of a vegetarian dietary; they contain a large 
proportion of protein, and, although a considerable proportion is 
evacuated unabsorbed, both Rubner and W'oroschiloff found that 
the nitrogen metabolism could be maintained in equilibrium when 
meat was replaced by peas or beans. But it would be impossible 
to live on peas or beans alone; 20 ounces, or 530 grammes, of pea- 
flour would contain 120 grammes of protein, 9 grammes oi fat, and 
360 grammes of carbohydrate, and would make twent}^ basins of 
pea-soup. But this would not be enough to maintain the nitrogen 
balance in equilibrium. Rubner found that 600 grammes of peas, 
boiled and eaten in a mush, w^ere insufficient; but 960 grammes 
gave the following result: Nitrogen in food, 32-7 grammes; in urine, 
21-5 grammes; in faeces, 9-1 grammes; gain to the body, 2-i grammes. 
Prausnitz studied the efficiency of beans in his laboratory servant, 
who consumed a diet containing 500 grammes of dried white beans, 
28-6 grammes of fat, 17-3 grammes of flour, salt, and vinegar. 
The beans were soaked in water for fifteen hours, boiled until soft, 
and eaten with a sauce made of flour mixed with fat, slightly 
browned by heat, and flavoured with vinegar. The unabsorbed 
protein amounted to 30-3 per cent., the nitrogen balance being as 
follows: Nitrogen in food, 17-9 grammes; in urine, 147 grammes; in 
faeces, 5-4 grammes; loss to the body, 2-2 grammes. From which is 
seen that at the lowest estimate 650 grammes of beans would be 
required daily to maintain the nitrogen in equilibrium. Fruit is not 
such a good source of protein as the legumes. The following was the 
actual amount of food consumed in twenty days (the onl}^ food of 
animal origin was cottage cheese, 280 grammes; the rest consisted 
of vegetables, fruit, and nuts): Tomatoes, 066 grammes; apples, 
6,682 grammes; bananas, 118 grammes; grapes, 21,613 grammes; 
cantaloupe (melon), 3,714 grammes; haws, 2,471 grammes; pears, 
2,804 grammes; pomegranates, 62 grammes; persimmons, 
2,098 grammes; oranges, 57 grammes; strawberries, 808 grammes; 
water-melons, 3,955 grammes; figs, 1,309 grammes; ahnonds, 
496 grammes; peanut-butter, 1,006 grammes; olive-oil, 207 grammes; 
honey, 133 grammes. The entire food gave a daily average of — 
Protein, 40 grammes; fat, 54 grammes; carbohydrate, 286 grammes; 
and had a fuel value of 1,713 calories. The deficiency in the supply 
and absorption of protein is one of the greatest disadvantages of 
the vegetarian dietary, and this deficiency is most severely felt by 
growing children, wlio need protein to build up their tissues; adults 
can bear a low protein diet better than children, for we have else- 
where seen that it is possible to maintain the nitrogen balance in 



198 SPECIAL DIETS 

equilibrium when the amount of protein actually absorbed is as 
low as 50 to 58 grammes daily. It is claimed, however, by 
physiologists and those especially who have given great attention 
to the stud}' of nutrition, that a low average of protein in the food 
is one of the chief causes of the liigh mortality among the poor. 

The protein of vegetables is not as valuable from a nutritive 
point of view as that of animal origin. Protein is protein whatever 
its origin, and albumin or globulin is of the same nutritive value 
whether it be from animals or vegetables. But one cannot get 
away from the practical fact that meat gives a greater degree of 
energy than peas or beans. This may be denied by vegetarians, 
but it is the general experience; there is a diflerence in the personal 
feeling — bioi etrc — when living on an ordinary diet from that which 
obtains when living on a vegetarian diet. Most vegetarians of 
European comnmnities are neurotics; they do not possess the 
energy, activity, and endurance of an ordinary individual. Why 
is this ? Given an equal amount of protein from the two sources, 
they have an equal value so far as anybody can tell. The proteins 
in animal foods are albumins and globulins; those in vegetables 
belong chiefly to the class of globulins. There are nucleo-proteins 
in both animal and vegetable foods. The non-protein nitrogen 
of animal foods consists chiefly of the extractives, creatin, creatinin, 
xanthin, hypoxanthin, carnin, urea and uric acid; that of vege- 
tables is chiefly in the form of amides and amino-acids — leucin, 
tyrosin, asparagin, etc. Herein lies the chief difference in the 
properties of animal and vegetable protein foods. The extractives 
of animal foods are more stimulating than those of vegetable foods. 
It is not contended that they give greater bodily strength. Energy 
is not to be confounded with muscular strength; energy is the 
property of the nerves, strength of the muscles. Physical work is 
done by the muscles, but it is initiated and controlled b}^ the 
nervous system. The extractives of meat are valuable nerve 
stimulants. Leucin, tyrosin, and other amino-acids of a like 
character are not stimulants, and unless they arc utilized by the 
cells of the intestinal mucosa in the construction of proteins, they 
pass on to the liver, where they are broken down into urea, uric 
acid, and ammonia. If they are too abundant to be broken down 
by the liver, they affect the organism adversely, and give rise to 
some of the symptoms of auto-intoxication. The last argument 
has been applied with equal force to the extractives and purin 
bodies in meat. But the display of energy by the carnivorais very 
much greater than that exhibited in general by the herbivora, and 
this is accounted for not only by the greater consumption of protein, 
but by the different character of the associated non-protein nitrogen 
compounds. 

The source of protein influences the metabolism and excretion 
of nitrogen. The Russians use the terms " assimilation " and 
" metabolism " in a very definite sense, which we might advan- 
tageously imitate. They use the term assimilated nitrogen for that 



OVA^^titatiVe and qualita rivi-: mhiahoiasm iw 

which is digested and absorbed. Quantiiative metabolism is the 
term used b}^ them to mean the ratio of the nitrogen in the urine to the 
assimilated nitrogen. Qualitative metabolism means the ratio of 
partially oxidized nitrogen in urine — i.e., nitrogen of, [extractives 
—to nitrogen of urea. The normal value of this ratio in man is 
assumed to be i : 14. Metabolism is qualitatively increased if this 
ratio is less than normal, and decreased if it is greater than nonnal. 
Having these points in view, Baftalovski of St. Petersburg made 
a number of observations on men with (i) animal diet, (2) mixed 
diet, and (3) varied vegetable chet. He summed up his results as 
follows: The total nitrogen of urine, nitrogen of urea, nitrogen of 
extractives, and uric acids, was greatest on the animal diet and 
least on the vegetable diet. A varied vegetable diet caused an 
excretion of only half as much nitrogen in the urine as when animal 
food was consumed, and only a quarter as much as when ordinary 
mixed food was eaten. On an animal diet the ratio of nitrogen of 
urea to the nitrogen of extractives was less than on a varied 
vegetable diet, and greater than on a mixed diet. On a mixed 
diet the ratio of nitrogen of urea to nitrogen of extractives was less 
than on either animal or vegetable foods. With a vegetable diet 
less urea and extractives was excreted than on a mixed or animal 
food, because less was absorbed. The total solids in the urine were 
nearly the same on a mixed diet and animal diet, but were the 
greatest on a vegetarian diet. The assimilation and metabolism 
were most complete on an animal diet, and least complete on 
vegetable diet. The organism was able to maintain nitrogen 
equilibrium on a varied vegetable diet, unless too much work was 
performed. \\'ith an unvaried vegetable diet the metabolism (ratio 
of N in urine to N of digested food) increased 300 per cent, over 
normal, and a protein famine resulted. When animal and un- 
varied vegetable food was consumed, the weight of the body 
decreased, but it increased on a mixed and a varied vegetable diet. 
An example may be taken from his observations. The subject was 
a physician, aged forty-two years, weight 57 kilos.

Some observations of other investigators may also be quoted. 
A certain amount of nitrogen is excreted by the kidneys even when 
no food is consumed; andVoit found that when the food consisted 
of fat and carbohydrates— that is, a sufhciency of energy-producing

material, but no nitrogen — the subject excreted 9-5 grammes of 
nitrogen in the urine. When the same subject fed on a vegetarian 
diet containing 8-3 grammes of nitrogen, tlie nitrogen equilibrium 
was not maintained — in fact, it was not all assimilated, and there 
was a deficiency of 4-9 grammes. Taniguti found that the balance 
was exactly maintained in a Japanese subject when the food, con- 
sisting of miso, rice, and other vegetables, contained 10-5 grammes 
of nitrogen per diem. The more food consumed the greater was 
the amount of nitrogen excreted, and the excretion was greater when 
animal food was consumed than when the diet was wholly vege- 
tarian. This is confinned by the observations of Baftolovski and 
Avsitidiski. Take two examples from the work of the latter: 

1. Man A, weighing 71 kilos, was fed first with {a) mixed diet 
for ten days, consisting of 304 grammes of meat, 800 grammes of 
bread, 50 grammes of butter, 700 c.c. of bouillon, and 2,270 c.c. of 
water, {b) He was then fed for ten days with the following 
vegetarian diet : 1,000 grammes of bread, 693 grammes of peasoup, 
153 grammes of buckwheat, 267 grammes of wheatmeal, 
140 grammes of macaroni, 30 grammes of butter, 50 grammes of 
sugar, 300 grammes of potatoes (two days), 380 grammes of peas 
(one day), 124 grammes of rice (one day), 200 grammes of cabbage 
(one day), 2,270 c.c. of water. 

2. Man B, weighing 69 kilos, had similar food. The results were 
as follows:

The results of all observations show thai the amount of nitrogen 
in the urine is always greater after animal food than after vegetable 
food; they clearly indicate that metabolism is stimulated by animal 
foods, that vegetable foods, even when the same amount of nitrogen 
is consumed, are not so readily assimilated — they do not stimulate 
metabolism to the same extent, and they tend to the accumulation 
of flesh or fat in the organism. 

Has the character of the protein any influence upon the develop- 
ment of organs and the performance of their functions ? The 
importance of a sufficiency of protein in the food cannot be dwelt 
upon too much. It is, moreover, in the period of growth and 
development of the body that an abundance of proteins is required. 
A low protein diet is, in the minds of most ph3'siologists, un- 



I 



FOOD AND REPRODUCTION 201 

suitable for growing children and young adults. Nevertheless 
there are many thousands of growing children who get only a low 
l)rotein diet, and whose jjrotein is chiefly vegetable in its origin 
But the question now is, Has the kind of protein any influence at 
this period ? The consumption of meat in England to-day is said 
to be seventeen times greater per person per annum than it was 
in 1850. In the intervening period there has been a marked decline 
in the birth-rate. It is also a fact that the decline in the birth-rate 
is most marked in those classes of people who have an unrestricted 
use of the more expensive proteins of flesh-foods, meat, game, fowl, 
and fish. On the other hand, the most fertile people are the 
poorest, or those whose consumption of animal proteins is restricted 
by its cost, and whose proteins are chiefly those of vegetable origin. 
It is believed by some authorities that the increasing consumption 
of meat and other animal foods affects the development of the 
organs of generation, acts prejudicially upon reproduction and 
lactation, and is thereby an important factor in the causation of the 
declining birth-rate and diminishing power of lactation. This 
opinion seems to be confimied by experiments on animals. W. P. 
Watson 1 made observations on rats. The comparison was between 
rats fed from birth on meat alone, and others fed on bread and milk. 
The "meat-fed rats " were less fertile than the others, and their 
mammary glands not so well developed. There was no marked 
difference in the structure of the mammae; but whereas the mammae 
of " bread-and-milk rats " averaged 9-6 per cent, of the weight of the 
body, those of " meat-fed rats " averaged only 8-2 per cent. 
Malcolm CampbelP studied the effects of meat and vegetarian diet 
upon the generative organs of rats, and found that there was a 
marked difference in the development of the generative organs and 
of fertility. He arrived at the following conclusions: The exclusive 
use of (i) a diet of flesh, (2) rice or porridge, induces, in the majority 
of cases, a modification in the structure of the uterine mucous 
membrane; this modification appears to consist in a diminution of 
the number of large cells of the connective-tissue type, which appear 
to be important constituents of a pltysiologically active uterine 
mucosa. This structural change was most profound in animals 
fed from weaning entirely with meat ; in most of these animals the 
development of the uterus was also much interfered with. This 
structural change is also associated with sterility, and the investi- 
gation shows that the sterility is probably due to the structural 
and developmental abnormalities of the uterus, induced by the 
abnormal diet. 

These conclusions cannot be accepted without further evidence. 
The fecundity of the poor and comparative sterility of the rich in 
highl}' civilized communities is matter of common knowledge. 
But to assert that one condition is due to a vegetarian or low protein 
diet, and the other to animal proteins or a high protein diet, is at 
present beyond our power. There is, in fact, very good evidence 

1 Brit. Med. Jour., 1907, i. 193. ^ Ibid., i,22i.j. 



202 SPECIAL DIETS 

that a flesh diet does not diminish fecundity when the consumers 
live a normal life. The Equimaux women are not sterile. The 
Indians of the Pampas, who live largely on a flesh diet, are very 
fertile. The Boer women eat meat at every meal, vegetables and 
potatoes being seldom seen on their tables; nevertheless they are 
most prolific, and feed their children by the breast. P. Watson 
considers these facts do not upset his theory. The subject of diet 
cannot be considered without reference to the habits and environ- 
ment. The open-air life and activity of the Boer women are in 
marked contrast to the conditions generally obtaining in this 
country-, and it may well be that the large amount of meat eaten by 
the Boers cannot be regarded for them as an excessive meat diet. 
In his experiments on rats in confinement the quantity of meat 
consumed was certainl}- excessive, and its use undoubtedly dimin- 
ished fecundity. It was this conclusion which led him, in connection 
with the increased consumption of animal food by human beings, 
to suggest that the latter might be one of the causes of the diminished 
birth-rate or fertility of women and their power of lactation at 
the present day. The well-known fertility of the Boers and 
Pampas Indians is in no way incompatible with this theory. 

The Fruitarian Diet. — Numerous experiments in metabolism have 
shown that it is possible for some persons to maintain their nitrogen 
balance in equilibrium with a diet consisting entirely of fruit and 
nuts. The investigations by Jaffa of fruitarians in California have 
a high value. Fruitarianism is a system of feeding which has 
spread very considerably during the past few years. However 
pleasant and agreeable it may be to the consumer, it is at the best 
a low protein diet, and seldom contains more than 50 or 60 grammes 
of protein, or from 8 to 10 grammes of nitrogen daily. It is 
unnecessary to repeat the arguments for or against the low protein 
diet, which have been considered in another chapter. In spite of 
the fact that Chittenden and other physiologists have found 
8 to 10 grammes of nitrogen in the daily food sufficient for the 
physiological needs of the body, and that people have maintained 
their health and vigour for years on fruitarian and other low- 
protein diets, they seldom look robust. The fruitarian diet, like 
the more common vegetarian diet, must be looked upon as being of 
doubtful value, and as quite unlikely to become a regular method 
of feeding among people who have the desire and taste for flesh- 
foods ingrained in them. There are, however, certain states of ill- 
health in which the use of a fruitarian diet is undoubtedly of great 
value as a temporary measure, and such cases will be mentioned 
farther on. As regards the nutritive value of the fruitarian diet, a 
single example taken from Jaffa's investigations, and a summary 
of other diets, will be sufficient. Those who desire further examples 
can refer to the original work.^ The subject of this investigation 
was a healthy and vigorous University student, aged twenty-two 
years, prominent in athletics. For the first week he ate his ordinary

mixed food, the next nine days lie consumed a diet in which fruit 
replaced a large proportion of the meat, eggs, fish, milk, and cereals ; 
finall}' he consumed for eight days a diet consisting entirely of fruit 
and nuts. The amount and composition of the food and the amount 
digested is shown in the table on pp. 204 and 205. 

An examination of the urine and faeces of other consumers showed 
that in many instances, although the diet was of a low protein 
character, the amount of protein digested and absorbed from the 
food was enough to maintain the nitrogen balance in equilibrium 
under the circumstances of the experiment. When the amount 
consumed daily consisted of 5| pounds of grapes, 6 ounces of 
walnuts, and a little granose, there was an actual gain of 
1-29 grammes of nitrogen, equal to 8 grammes of protein. In 
another instance the average daily consumption consisted of 
4^ pounds of apples, 8 ounces of dried figs, and 4I ounces of walnuts, 
which also resulted in a gain of 1-28 grammes of nitrogen, or 
8 grammes of protein. With a diet averaging 3I pounds of apples, 
9^ ounces of dates, 6 ounces of peanuts, a little granose, milk, 
olive-oil, and tomato, the gain of nitrogen was 2-26 grammes, equal 
to 14-13 grammes of protein. With 5^ pounds of pears, 7 ounces 
of walnuts, a little granose and milk, there was a gain of 
4-25 grammes of nitrogen, equivalent to 26-5 grammes of protein; 
and with a diet averaging 16 ounces of w^alnuts, 18^ ounces of dried 
prunes, and 18 ounces of oranges, there was a gain of 3-42 grammes 
of nitrogen, or 21-38 grammes of protein. 

The experiments in feeding with bananas did not give such good 
results. In Xo. i, bananas, dates, and walnuts resulted in a loss 
of 1-82 grammes of nitrogen, or 11-38 grammes of protein; bananas, 
oranges, and walnuts gave a deficiency of 1-89 grammes of nitrogen, 
or 1 1 -8 grammes of protein. The consumption of 5 pounds of 
bananas a day resulted in a loss of 1-34 grammes of nitrogen, or 
8-38 grammes of protein; 4 pounds of bananas and 4I ounces of 
almonds daily, gave a deficiency of 0-86 gramme of nitrogen, or 5-38 
grammes of protein ; 2^ pounds of bananas, 21 ounces of oranges, and 
5 ounces of peccan nuts, gave a deficiency of i -69 grammesof nitrogen , 
or 10 •56 grammes of protein. A diet of 22 ounces of dates, 2f ounces 
of almonds, and 12 ounces of olives, gave a deficiency of 2-06 grammes 
of nitrogen, or 12-88 grammes of protein. A diet of pears and 
cocoanut gave a loss of 1-57 grammes of nitrogen and 8-8 grammes 
of protein. The deficiency is not great in any of these cases; but 
the continued daily loss of i or 2 grammes of nitrogen by the body 
is deleterious, and must ultimately result in ill-health. It is 
possible, as we have seen, to prevent such a loss by means of a 
carefully regulated diet; but it is difficult for the non-scientific 
subject to adjust his diet so carefully to the needs of the body. In 
this respect, therefore, we are bound to state that very few fruit- 
arian diets contain enough protein to maintain the nitrogen balance 
in equilibrium; and still fewer contain the amount of protein 
recjuired by the standards set uj) by numerous authorities. The

206 SPECIAL DIETS 

amount of fat in the food is also almost always below the standard 
required, ami only reaches the standard when the food contains a 
large proportion of nuts, olives, or olive-oil. The nutriment in 
fruit consists chiefly of carbohydrates, the digestibility of which 
compares very favourably with the carbohydrates in a mixed diet. 
Respecting the heat-value of the food, the above table shows that 
the amount of energy yielded by the food is greater in proportion 
to the amount of fat; it islow with bananas, but better when bananas 
and nuts are consumed together; it is also low with apples, pears, 
or grapes as a diet, but is considerably improved by the consump- 
tion of half a pound of brazil nuts, peccans, or walnuts. A diet of 
apples, figs, and walnuts, or of pears, figs, and walnuts, is capable 
of supplying enough protein, fat, and carbohydrate for the use of 
the body, and with sufficient energy for a man doing moderate 
work. 

Fruit in Sickness or Ill-Health. — A diet of fruit or fruit and nuts 
is useful as a temporary mode of feeding in all cases where it is con- 
sidered desirable to reduce the consumption of protein, and especi- 
ally when it is considered necessary to exclude the purin bodies as 
much as possible. When an ordinary fruit and nut diet is taken, 
the nuts should be ground in a mill, the food should be eaten slowly, 
carefully masticated, and consmiied in moderation; and the meals 
should not exceed three in a da}-, and many people are better with 
two meals than with three. But the " fruit cure " is especially 
valuable in the case of gross feeders, who clog their system with a 
superfluity of food and drink; for those who awake in the morning 
with a disagreeable taste in the mouth, a headache, and other dis- 
agreeable symptoms; in many cases of albuminuria, intestinal 
fermentation, chronic diarrhoea; and in obesity, gout, migraine, 
eczema, urticaria, and other diseases which are the heritage of a 
pernicious system of feeding in the wealthy, and even more par- 
ticularly in families which, having lived quiet and simple lives in 
the country, modify their manner of living when they better them- 
st',lves socially. The " fruit cure " is a form of treatment for these 
case3. available for all classes. It is poor in proteins. It increases 
the alKalinity of the blood, decreases the acidity of the urine, is 
diuretic a.^d laxative, lessens intestinal fermentation, and stimu- 
lates the action of the liver. In acute nephritis, fruit, such as 
raisins, orange."^, and pears, will supplement the carbohydrates of 
the milk. Under" mixed treatment of albuminuria, milk and fruits 
lessen the alb umiri aria, diuresis is encouraged, and oedema dis- 
appears. If it is desire\d to increase the weight of the patient, some 
raisins may be taken along with a diet rich in fat and albumin. If 
it is desired to decrease the weight of the patient, a large quantity 
of raisins or raisin juice may be taken with a corresponding reduction 
of proteins and fats, other fruits and vegetables being taken at the 
same time. Moreover, it is useful, if the patient, is on ordinary diet, 
to recommend a " fast-day " once a week, when the only food 
should consist of apples, grapes, bananas, or some other fruit. 



FRUIT CURES 207 

Aj)i)lc- fasts" have been recomniended to many persons, especially 
those who are undergoing a reduction of tlreir weiglit, and in the 
treatment of gout, gravel, chronic rheumatism, chronic liver troubles. 
Bright 's disease, and in the condition of high arterial tension which 
precedes arterio-sclerosis and some forms of renal disease, in intes- 
tinal fermentations, chronic constipation, etc. " Fasts " of this 
nature do not agree equally well with all patients, and there are 
some persons who cannot bear abstention from their ordinary food 
for so long as twenty-four hours, even though they may consume an 
equal bulk of fruit. 

The use of fruit in the treatment of acute febrile affections 
is very ancient. Grapes, strawberries, oranges, bananas, and cooked 
apples may in many cases be eaten freely. The fruit juices 
are exceedingly valuable as an aid to treatment ; they increase the 
secretion of urine and its alkalinity, stimulate the kidneys, and, 
indirectly, the skin; at the same time they are cooling and refresh- 
ing. The juice of grapes, oranges, pineapples, currants, goose- 
berries, raspberries, strawberries, may be freely used. Lemon-juice 
is one of the commonest articles in a sick-room; in the form of 
lemon-water, lemonade, or combined with eggs, it is most useful. 
The white of an egg in \ pint of lemon-water, sweetened with sugar, 
is very nutritious. The whole of a raw egg may be beaten up, 
mixed with .1 pint of lemon-water, and sweetened with sugar. 
Orangeade, made by adding the juice of oranges to an infusion of 
fresh orange-peel in water, sweetened with sugar, is also agreeable 
in febrile conditions. Oranges are as useful in illness as they are 
acceptable in health; in febrile conditions their juicy pulp is anti- 
febrile, and has been credited with specific curative properties in 
influenza. Tamarind whey, made by mixing i ounce of tamarind 
pulp with i| pints of hot milk, is a refrigerant beverage. But the 
use of milk should not be forgotten ; from 2| to 3 pints of milk daily 
should be taken in acute affections, in combination with a diet of 
fruit or fruit-juice. 

The Grape Cure. — -This is the chief example of the one- fruit cure. 
It has long been practised in the Tyrol, at Montreux, Meran, Gries, 
Botzen, Wiesbaden, and other places; and it can be carried out 
wherever the grapes are available. The " cure " occupies six or 
seven weeks, and consists of the consumption of from 3 to 12 pounds 
or more of grapes per day, the quantity being gradually increased. 
The rest of the food, as well as the amount of fruit, should be in 
accordance with medical instructions. The mastication of a large 
number of grapes is said to injure the enamel of the teeth, and may 
cause soreness of the mouth ; this is best prevented bv eating a little 
bread after the fruit, or washing the mouth with a solution of bicar- 
bonate of soda, and by avoiding the mastication of the fruit, the 
grapes being swallowed after just cracking them with the tongue. 
The treatment is begun by the consumption of 2 pounds a day — 
i.e., ^ pound before breakfast, •^ pound in the middle of the morning, 
\ pound after the midday meal, and | pound about 5 p.m. The 



2o8 SPECIAL DIETS 

lime and amount of tlio increase ilepends upon tlic disease and 
condition of tlie patient. In pulmonary cases it is rarely advisable 
to prescribe more than 2 pounds a day; in gastric and intestinal 
catarrh, 3 pounds daily is the usual quantity; 4 pounds being the 
amount in gouty conditions, calculus, vesical affections, hccmor- 
rhoids, chronic constipation, etc., and from 5 to 6 pounds in ab- 
dominal plethora, with hepatic congestion and chronic constipation. 
As a cure for phthisis, the value depends entirely on the liberal 
feeding and climatic conditions; and care must be taken that diar- 
rhaa is not induced by the use of the fruit. I'eople who are convales- 
cent from many diseases, those who are overworked or suffering from 
various debilitating causes, will find the "cure " useful to them 
in proportion to the benefit derived from change of climate and 
occupation. The corpulent and obese derive great benefit from 
the " cure " when it is associated with a spare diet, restricted in the 
amount of fat and carbohydrate. The laxative effect of the " cure " 
begins in three or four da\'s, and is of great service in relieving the 
abdominal plethora resulting from passive congestions due to 
cardiac debility, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, chronic con- 
stipation, liver disease, and other causes of portal congestion. In 
some cases the effect of the cure is enhanced by the low protein 
value of the diet— t?.^., gout and gouty concretions; in others, such 
as chronic constipation, gastric and intestinal catarrh, by the 
mechanical effect of the skins anci seeds; and, in another group 
of cases, by the diuretic effect of the sugar and potassium salts; 
and in obesit\- by alla3'ing the craving for food when on a dimin- 
ished diet. 

The Lemon Cure is an ancient practice in the treatment of gout 
and obesity, and is very useful when combined with hot-air or 
steam-baths. The juice of two or three fresh lemons is taken in 
sweetened water three times a day; meanwhile, milk and fatty 
foods are avoided. Preserved lemon-juice is not so effective as that 
from fresh fruit; neither is citric acid. It is doubtful whether 
there is any scientific basis for the consumption of lemon-juice as 
an antifat and antigout remedy. The use of citric acid in the 
quack remedies for obesity has long been known ; indeed many of 
these remedies contain little else. The effect upon the food, if any, 
lies in the direction of the digestion of fat and carbohydrates; the 
citric acid appears to have an inhibitory power over steapsin and 
amylopsin. 

Meat Diets — (a) Meat Exclusively. — A diet consisting entirely of 
meat has been used in the treatment of tuberculosis, on the follow- 
ing grounds: It may be assumed that the association of gout with 
free hving is mainly due to the consumption of an excessive amount 
of meat, game, and other flesh foods; that a gout}' condition can be 
artificially induced by a diet consisting largely of meat ; and it is 
believed that there is an antagonism between the gouty condition 
and tuberculosis. The object of the exclusive meat diet therefore 
is to induce that condition which is believed to be antagonistic to

the growth of Bacillus tuberculosis or to its toxins. When this 
method of feeding is adopted, the meat must be freed from bone, 
gristle, and connective tissue, and lightly cooked. It must be 
taken in sufficient quantity to supply the heat expended by the 
body: 2,000 to 2,700 calories or more, according to the condition or 
occupation of the patient. 

The patient must consume from 2 to zh pounds of the edible 
portion of average beef or nuuton, to supply the body with enough 
fuel to meet the demands of the organism. (Jne pound equals 453 
granunes. Rubner experimented with the whole meat diet upon a 
healthy medical student. The food consisted of 738 to 884 grammes 
of beef, freed from fat, gristle, connective tissue, and bone, and 
cooked with a little butter, onion, salt, and pepper. The beverage 
consisted of water or aerated water. Specimens of the food, after 
cooking it, were analyzed to determine the amount of protein and 
fat. For this purpose the dried fat-free flesh was supposed to 
contain 14-11 per cent, of nitrogen. It was well digested, the 
faeces containing only rz grammes of nitrogen, or about 7 grammes 
of protein. The nitrogen balance was maintained, and a slight 
gain to the body resulted. Solntzer also experimented with beef 
and mutton; Atwater experimented with both beef and fish. The 
results of some of these experiments, as regards the nitrogen balance, 
are as follows:

An entire meat diet is also used in the treatment of obesity, 
chronic articular gout, diabetes, dyspepsia, and psoriasis. As a 
treatment for chronic dyspepsia, especially when the condition is 
that of atony, dilatation of the stomach, or hyperchlorhydria, its 
value is undoubted. It is, however, essential that sufficient nutri- 
ment be consumed to meet the demands of the bod}-. When a 

14

person is lying in bed, absolutely at rest, the heat expended by the 
body amounts to at least i,6oo calories; and the food consumed 
should not supply less than this amount of heat. The quantity of 
meat should not be less than 6 ounces of cooked minced meat three 
times a day; the inter\als being four and a half to five hours. 
With this unusual quantity of nitrogen, plenty of liquids, prefer- 
ably hot water, must be taken. The simplicity of the diet and its 
freedom from carbohydrate are the chief features of the treatment. 
Its chief value in obesity, diabetes, gout, and other affections, is 
likewise due to the absence of carbohydrate. The Salisbury meat- 
cure lasts from four to twelve weeks. The food consists of 2 to 4 
pounds of beef freed from fat, gristle, connective tissue, and bone; 
it is chopped very fine, made into patties about 3 inches in diameter 
and I inch tliick, and fried in a pan without fat or water; they are 
heated rapidly on one side and then on the other to coagulate the 
albumin, and afterwards cooked more slowly, and slightly under- 
done. During the first period (two or three weeks) no other food 
was allowed b}' Salisbury excepting 6 pints of hot water, to be 
taken thus: i pint in the morning while dressing, i pint with the 
breakfast, i pint before the midday meal, i pint at 4 p.m., i pint 
at 7.30 p.m., and i pint at 10 p.m. It is allowed to flavour the 
water with lemon-juice. It is also now usual to allow the meat to 
be eaten with salt, pepper, mustard, horseradish, celery-salt, 
butter, and various commercial sauces and relishes. The diet was 
modified by Towers- Smith, who had great success in the treatment 
of obesity and other diseases by means of it. 

2. Zomotherapy, or treatment by raw meat and raw-meat juice. 
Some years ago Richet and Hericourt called attention to the 
remarkable results obtained by treating tuberculous patients with 
raw meat, and also to the effects a raw-meat chet had in enabling 
animals which had been inoculated with tubercle to resist that 
infection. Since that time raw meat has become recognized as a 
valuable aid in the treatment of tuberculosis, anaemia, chlorosis, 
gastric and duodenal ulcer, and other conditions. The amount of 
raw meat recommended is i pound daily, no cooked meat being 
allowed ; but there are very few people who can take the prescribed 
quantity; in fact, it is seldom that more than ^ or | pound is con- 
sumed, even when it is taken in aspic and seasoned with ketchup. 
There are various objections to the consumption of raw meat, such 
as the risks of ta-nia and other parasites, and it involves a consider- 
able amount of trouble in reducing it to a pulp. Raw meat is an 
ancient remedy; but in recent times it was first recommended by 
Fuster of Montpellier for phthisis, empyema, and other suppurative 
diseases. It is now prescribed in that state of debility known as 
" prephthisis," in early phthisis, latent phthisis, and tuberculosis, in 
anaemia, general debility, neurasthenia, convalescence from acute 
illness, and after severe haemorrhage. It produces an increase of 
vigour and muscular power, the proportion of haemoglobin is in- 
creased, the blood-pressure is raised, digestion improved, weight

increased, and the pliysical signs of phthisis or tuberculosis are 
abated. Tlie treatment is continued for at least one month, and in 
many cases for a period varyinj^ with the extent of the disease and 
the improvement obtained. The treatment is contra-indicated in 
cases of ha'moptysis, or wiien the nervous system is easily e.xcited, 
in the arthritic condition, various forms of intoxicaticm, and disease 
of the liver or kidne\'s. 

Raic-M cat Juice. — Since the publication, in 1889, of Richet and 
Horicourt's observations on the effect of raw meat on the progress 
of tuberculosis in dogs, they have continued their experiments for the 
purpose of discovering a means of arresting tuberculosis. In a 
recent paper on the subject,^ Hericourt says: " It is probably no 
exaggeration to say that the raw-meat treatment of pulmonary 
phthisis yields results not approached by any other means at present 
available." With this experience Professor Richet and he under- 
took researches to find out which constituent in the muscular tissue 
it is which exercises this antagonism to the progress of tuberculosis. 
They found that the solid constituents of the flesh had no thera- 
peutical action; indeed, " tuberculized animals fed on flesh from 
which the muscle plasma had been expressed died in approximately 
the same lapse of time as the control animals who were fed with 
ordinary food. But the administration of the expressed meat- 
juice to other tuberculized animals prevented infection taking place ; 
these animals did not fall ill, but they remained in particularly 
robust health, showing a substantial increase in weight after an 
interval of several weeks. When the muscle-juice was given to 
animals actually under the empire of tuberculous infection, the 
emaciation ceased, and they were restored to health, while the con- 
trol animals died."- The deduction is that the agent of raw meat 
which produces this effect resides in the muscle plasma — i.e., the 
meat-juice ; and the method of treatment, based on the administration 
of meat-juice as a remedial agent, is called by them " zomotherapy," 
from Zoj/xo'j, meat-juice. Hericourt points out^ that heat destroys 
the organic principles to which the efficacy of raw meat is due; and 
that the same effect is not obtained from forced feeding with cooked 
meat, nor with any liquid preparation such as " liquid meat," 
" meat-juice," or " meat extracts," which have been manufactured 
by the aid of heat. The latter substances are valuable foods, but 
"they possess none of the therapeutical properties which are in- 
herent to raw meat." There is some difficulty in obtaining the 
meat-juice ; but various presses are sold by which it can be got. An 
ordinary domestic press will yield about 25 per cent, of juice; and 
the more powerful presses from 40 to 50 per cent. The juice should 
be collected in a \ essel surrounded by ice and consumed as soon as 
possible. The meat should be perfectly /rt's/z, obtained within two 
or three hours after being slaughtered in the summer, and four 
hours in the winter. Hericourt considers this is a most important 

^ Lancet, 191 1, i. 22. - Ibid. " Loc. ci.. 



212 SPFXIAL DIETS 

point ; because meat-juice is eminently unstal>le, its appearance 
changing within an liour of its separation, and it develops toxic 
properties whicli render it imiit for human consumption. Tlie daily 
dose is the muscle plasma obtained from 300 to 500 grammes (10 to 
17 ounces) of beef, the maximum being given in bad cases. Smaller 
quantities are beneficial, but cannot be relied on in tuberculosis to 
give characteristic results. The inconclusi\e results reported from 
time to time, according to Hcricourt, are due to neglect of these 
cardinal principles, though it is only fair to add that there are a few 
cases, usually associated with secondary infection, which prove 
refractory. The benefits of zomotherapy are not limited to tuber- 
culosis. Raw-meat juice is of the greatest service in the treatment 
of anaemia, chlorosis, gastric and duodenal ulcer, rickets, scurvy- 
rickets, neurasthenia, after hajmorrhage, typhoid fever, and when- 
ever it is desired to reinforce the defensive apparatus against the 
ravages of disease. 

There is as yet no clear scientific explanation of the action of 
raw-meat juice. At the time when Richet and Hcricourt carried out 
their early experiments, the theory of antitoxins had been just 
elaborated, and it was thought that the action of muscle plasma in 
tuberculosis was due to an antitoxin. The fact that tuberculosis 
never invades muscle fibre, but a well-marked atrophy of muscular 
tissue occurs in phthisical subjects, suggests the possibility that 
muscle is sacrificed in the defence of the organism. On the other 
hand, the raw-meat juice or muscle plasma contains enzymes and 
ferments, which play an active part in nutrition, and especially in 
the struggle against infective diseases, and may conceivably account 
for the beneficial results from the ingestion of this fluid. Another 
explanation is that muscle plasma or raw-meat juice is merely a 
special stimulant to the nervous system. A slight but charac- 
teristic exhilaration always follows the consumption of large 
quantities of raw-meat juice, and therefore it is possible that the 
good effects of zomotherapy in diseases other than tuberculosis are 
due to nervous stimulation. Still another explanation has been 
offered— -viz., that the effects are due to stimulation of the thyroid 
gland. Cautley says there is evidence that defective thyroid 
activity predisposes to tuberculous affections; these diseases follow 
rapid growth, infectious diseases, prolonged lactation, sexual ex- 
cesses, and alcoholism, in all of which the thyroid secretion is liable 
to be used up and the gland to atrophy from overstimulation. 
Thyroid activity' is stimulated by raw meat and milk. The infant 
thyroid contains but little colloid. But it is probaole that milk 
contains some of the internal secretion of the thyroid, for iodine 
can reach the infant through the mammary gland, and infantile 
myxadema rarely develops until after weaning. The decomposi- 
tion products of raw meat increase the colloid material in the thyroid 
gland, as was shown in 1897 by C.alleotti and I.indermann. Chalmers 
Watson also found that the consumption of raw meat caused an 
increase of the thyroids and parathyroids in fowls; but Forsyth

following the same mode of feeding, difl not find sncli increase in 
the gland. 

The Preparation of Ran-Meat Jiiicc — It should be distinctly 
understood that heat is not to be applied to the meat, nor to the 
plasma after it is obtained. 

(i) By Pressure. — It is prepared on a large scale by hydraulic or 
steam pressure, the meat yielding about 25 or zd' per cent, of meat- 
juice or plasma from the flesh of newly killed animals, an e.xample 
being the Carnine Lefranc, a sweet syrupy liquid, which is recom- 
mended to be taken cold in any liquid e.xcept beef-tea- Various 
meat-presses are sold for preparing the juice on a small scale, which 
will e.xpress 25 or 30 per cent, of the muscle plasma. In domestic 
preparation of meat-juice, rump beef-steak is the most suitable 
source; it is minced, put into a linen wrapper, and submitted to such 
pressure as can be obtained. 

(2) By Diffusion. — Rump beef-steak is cut with scissors into 
pieces about i inch square and } inch thick, and put into a basin ; 
a quantity of cold water equal to the weight of meat is poured 
over it, a small amount of salt is added, and the material allowed 
to remain in a cold place for si.x or eight hours. The juice is then 
poured off and the meat squeezed dry. The juice is a red liquid, 
and the meat quite colourless when it is properly done. It is 
usually given in a coloured wine-glass, with an equal quantity of 
port w^ine. In many households this is the only fonn of raw-meat 
juice obtainable- It cannot be claimed that its therapeutic effects 
are equal to those of meat-juice obtained by high pressure of 
meat two or three hours after slaughter; but the effects of this 
modified meat plasma are truly remarkable in anaemia, chlorosis, 
gastric and duodenal ulcer, neurasthenia, and even in tuberculosis. 
The use of fresh meat must be insisted on, as well as keeping it 
away from the fire. Heat destroys the therapeutic properties of 
meat-juice. Decomposition of some of the principles in the plasma 
takes place very readily. Rigor mortis is attended by changes in 
the myosinogen, a loss of syntonin, and a development of lactic 
acid ; the muscle-juice contains a ferment which transforms glycogen 
into sugar after death; as the rigor mortis passes off, the myosin 
again breaks down into myosinogen, the fonnation of albumoses 
and peptone occurs, with other products of decomposition, which 
may set up enteritis, hepatic and renal troubles; and the natural 
enzymes of the plasma are destroyed. 

Milk Diets.— As a " cure " milk, entire or skimmed, sweet or sour, 
butter-milk, whey, an(^ various other preparations of milk are 
used. 

I- Tlie milk cure consists of the consumption of ordinary milk, 
in its pure, undiluted, and uncooked condition- The milk should 
betaken fresh and warm, just as it is drawn from the cow- In this 
condition it is the most free from bacteria, it contains the greatest 
proportion of enz\nnes, and has the highest bactericidal capacity. 
This " cure " is exceedingly ancient, and is of great value in the 



214 SPECIAL DIFTS 

treatment of tuberculosis, nervous diseases, and nian\- conditions 
oi debility, llie application of the remedy is only possible on a 
limited scale, and in rural districts, or such places where cattle are 
kept for the purpose. The cattle should be of a good breed and free 
from tubercle or other serious ailment. A modified milk cure is 
that which is usually carried out in hospitals and sanatoria, where 
the milk is sup}ilied from farms which are often many miles away, 
ll is employed in febrile conditions, in gastric and enteric disorders, 
neurasthenia, hepatic and renal affections, heart and arterial dis- 
eases, arthritic cimditions, alcoholism, chronic bronchitis, obesity, 
and other affections. In these cases also the milk is frequently 
taken nm' : Init it must not be forgotten that the bactericidal power 
of milk diminishes rapidly after it is drawn, and a few hours after 
milking the cows it is practically nil. There is, however, the lecithin 
and small quantities of other bodies to be considered, which are 
destroyed by heat of 140° F. There are important constituents 
of milk, and should not be ruthlessly destroyed. If the source of 
the milk can be depended on ; if it is protected from pollution b}' 
pathogenic organisms; and if there is no other reason against the 
consumption of raw milk, such as the formation of curds, raw milk 
should be taken in preference to any other. When for any reason 
it is considered undesirable to drink the milk raw, it may be boiled 
or baked, peptonized or pancreatized, and taken alone or with 
diluents such as barley-water, oatmeal-water, or lime-water, or 
its composition may be altered by the addition of extract of malt, 
dextrin, a small amount of farinaceous material, meat extract, or 
burnt sugar. In order to supply the body with enough protein 
and energy on a diet consisting of milk alone, a considerable quan- 
tity must be consumed. Milk of average quality has a heat value 
of 410 calories per pint. If it is consumed in large quantities, 
digestive derangements very soon occur as the result of the forma- 
tion of large curds in the stomach ; if these pass the pylorus, they are 
apt to become matted together in the intestines, and thus resist the 
action of the digestive enzymes, causing diarrhoea or constipation, 
with hard dry faces. Rubneri found that the undigested material 
from meat amounts to 4-1 to 47 per cent., of eggs 47, and of milk 
5-4, per cent. Atwater found that w^ith a milk diet 97 per cent, of 
proteins, 95 per cent, of fat, and 98 per cent, of carbohydrates were 
absorbed. Other authorities have found as much as 97 per cent, of 
fat absorbed. Milk, therefore, is one of the most digestible foods; 
but 3 litres, or a little more than 5 pints, daily, would be required to 
supply an adult with enough energy for the perfonr.ance of light 
work. The nitrogen balance is not maintained bv an adult man 
upon less than 3 litres a day, and when less than "this quantity is 
consumed, most people show a loss of nitrogen. 

Tn the " milk cure " the milk should be given raw, or of the tem- 
perature of the atmosphere, and whenever possible it should be 
conveyed from the cow to the patient as soon as convenient, to

avoid the loss of the enzynics au'l antibodies contained in it. ICven 
in the winter-time it should not be heated above 140^ l-"., because 
lecithin and other important bodies are destroyed bv a temperature 
hi.^her than this de.^ree. The milk should never be boiled, except 
when there is diarrhoi'a, or the source and purity of the milk is 
doubtful, not only because boiling it destroys the natural enzymes, 
lecithin, nuclein, and other bodies, but because it is rendered some- 
what less digestible than unboiled milk. IJstov found tlRUjuantita- 
tive metabolism of new milk is 91-4 per cent., sterilized milk only 
go-4 per cent., and it contains no peptones. Boiling the milk un- 
doubtedly destroys bacteria, and a few years ago it was customary 
to recommend that all milk should be boiled for a minute or two to 
destroy them ; boiled milk also has the acUantage of forming smaller 
curds than unboiled milk. But in the light of recent knowledge it 
is considered that pure and wholesome milk should not be heated. 

The object of the physician in recommending the milk cure may 
be not only to maintain the nitrogen balance, but to produce a gain 
to the body: in other cases it is not the intention of the physician to 
maintain the nitrogen balance or the nutrition in equilibrium, but 
to unload the system of superfluous weight, water, purins, or some 
other substance which is considered to be deleterious. Thus in the 
Weir Mitchell treatment the object is to cause a gain of protein, and, 
by means of a " forced diet," to benefit enfeebled nervous and 
muscular systems. In this treatment the patient is kept in bed 
and fed for a time entirely with milk, advancing from 2 pints on the 
first to 4 or 5 pints on the eight-day {see Weir Mitchell Treaiment). 
The milk is given in divided doses, 2 to 10 ounces every two hours, 
day and night, and sipped slowly; the intervals are increased as 
more milk is taken, and the night-feeding reduced to one meal. 
When the faeces become small and firm, showing that the milk is 
being fairly well absorbed, the dose is increased to 10, 15, or 20 ounces 
per meal, and the intervals extended to three or four hours, so that 
the total milk amounts to 5 or 6 pints daily. 

During the first period of the milk cure — usually two weeks — 
nothing but milk is allowed, unless it is necessary to alter the flavour 
or modify its constituents. The flavour may be varied by the 
addition of salt, celery-salt, the decoction of cocoa nibs, burnt sugar, 
or extract of malt ; the formation of large curds may be prevented 
by the addition of lime-water, barley-water, oatmeal-water, extract 
of malt, citrate of soda, etc. Nausea is likewise prevented by these 
modifications; flatulence may be prevented to a considerable extent 
by the addition of Vichy water, or a little salt and carbonate of 
soda; thirst, sometimes complained of, may be relieved by sucking 
a small piece of lemon, or washing out the mouth after each meal 
with plain or aerated water, or with acid liquids, such as lemon- 
water, citric acid, tartaric acid, or cream of tartar and water; or, 
better still, bv a mild germicide, such as a solution of boric acid or 
glyco-thymoline. 

Thefirst part of the milk cureis aperiodof semistan'ation or under-

feeding, f(»r even during absolute rest in bed i,6<^o calories of energy 
are expended daily, which would require the digestion of 4 pints of 
milk. The subniitrition causes the patient to be sleepless and 
watchful ; the milk causes the tongue to become coated with a thick 
creamy fur, and there is a nasty taste in the mouth, frequently a 
considerable amount of flatulence, and sometimes pain from the 
evolution of hvdrogen and other gases. The bowels are confined, 
and act every two or three days, the f;cces being devoid of fa.cal 
odour, and vary in colour from yellow to orange. There may be 
diarrhoea from casein-indigestion, from excess of fat, or want of 
freshness in the milk. The urine is usually increased in proportion 
to the consumption of liquids and the diuretic action of the lactose; 
it contains very little uric acid and purin bodies, but the urea is in 
proportion to the digested casein ; and the colour often has a greenish 
tinge. As the consumption of milk increases and the system 
becomes satisfied, the patient passes from wakefulness to drowsi- 
ness, which is a fairly good sign when the tongue is clean and the 
pulse is good. After two or three weeks, even though the patient 
is now gaining flesh, the appetite begins to gain strength, and the 
desire for solid food increases. Now^ is the time to add to the diet 
some Benger's or other farinaceous food, with a little stale bread 
and butter. In another fourteen days a little fish or fowl may be 
allowed in the middle of the day, and after the end of one month a 
gradual return to ordinary diet takes place. 

2. Skim milk is emploj'ed as a cure in cases of heart disease, 
nephritis, gout, obesity, chronic bronchitis and emphj^sema, and 
various other diseases. IT miist be clearly understood that it is a 
diet which only partially supplies the energy expended by the 
body; that it is a system of underfeeding, and that there is a definite 
intention on the part of the physician to reduce the patient more or 
less. The average composition of skiin milk is: water 90-5, nitro- 
genousmatters 3-4, fat 0-3, sugar 5-1, ash 0-7, per cent. ; and it has 
a heat value of only 212 calories per pint. 

In 1865 Karell reported 200 cases in which he had employed this 
diet as a method of treatment for unloading the system generally, 
but especially the vascular system. He recommended that at first 
the milk should be taken only three or four times a day, and later 
every four hours; the quantity allowed was ^ to ^ pint of skim milk 
at each meal, sipped slowly. " Separated milk " can be bought 
from a dairy, or the milk can be skimmed in the house. The milk 
should be obtained fresh twice daily. The complete removal of 
fat is not desirable in all cases; more fat can be allowed to some 
patients than to others. Donkin had considerable experience in 
the treatment of disease by skim-milk diet, and highly recommended 
it for the treatment of diabetes, beginning with 4 pints, and gradu- 
ally increasing the amount, sometimes to a maximum of 12 pints 
daily. Lenhartz systematically employed the skim -milk diet for 
fifteen years in the treatment of heart disease with failure of com- 
pensation, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and obesity with an 



i 



SKIM-MILK CUKK 217 

overtaxed heart. Rocniheld and Morit/. have recommended it for 
obesity, heart ihsease, gout, and nephritis. But all cases arc not 
treated with skim-milk; pure milk is sometimes used. Under 
Lenhartz the patient was placed in bed and absolutely at rest; 
during the first week (or at least ftve days) he was allowed only 
200 cc. (7 ounces) of milk four times a day; during the next stage, 
varying from two to six days, he was allowed one egg and some 
zwiebach; later on some minced meat and vegetables were added; 
so that after about twelve days there was a gradual return to full 
mixed diet. Special care must be taken to secure a daily evacua- 
tion of the bowels. When the heart has sufficient reserve power, 
the effect of the treatment is seen in the greatly increased diuresis, 
loss of weight, and increase of cardiac power or re-establishment of 
compensation. Failure to obtain relief was considered by Lenhartz 
to be a sign of advanced degeneration of the cardiac muscle. 

Roemheld^ puts his patients on to a partial milk diet — i.e., milk 
only on two or three days in each week throughout the cure; on 
" milk days " he prescribes i litre to li litres (i| to 2 pints) of milk, 
and nothing else; on other days he allows a mixed diet to yield 
from I to I of the energy expended by the body. The " milk days " 
are especially effective at the beginning of treatment for failure 
of compensation. The diet is also suitable for nephritis, gout, and 
obesity. After the cure, the patient may keep his weight down 
for an indefinite time if he will continue to have two " milk days " 
in each week. Moritz recommended the milk cure to be continued 
for weeks. In his system the food consists of milk alone ; and the 
amount allowed varies from i] to 2^ litres (2 to 4^ pints) daily; 
He claims that this is the simplest cure for obesity, that the patient 
loses an average of 200 grammes daily without suffering from thirst 
or hunger, and as a rule can go about his work during the treatment, 
but requires to be under observation. Strauss^ also employs the 
milk cure for obesity of moderate and severe grades, and recom- 
mends a tumblerful of milk to be taken four or five times a day at 
inter\'als of 2f hours for about a week ; after this time the patients 
are given less milk but are allowed small quantities of lean meat, 
sausage, vegetables, and bread, but no fat ; in a few cases the milk 
is now stopped and a mixed diet of low calorie value is prescribed. 
Strauss does not agree with Roemheld's system of treatment by 
" milk days "; but considers it is better in medium cases of obesity, 
complicated by heart lesions, nephritis, gout, or gljxosuria, to 
prescribe a " miniature cure " of three or four days' duration, with 
rest in bed and massage. The loss of weight is greatest during the 
first three days, and averages 4^ to 6^ pounds, but by the end of 
the week the total loss is from 8^ to 11 pounds; during the after-cure 
the loss of weight is more gradual than in the actual " cure. " There 
is little doubt that the loss of weight is partly due to underfeeding; 
but it is also due in part to the loss of water by the tissues. In a

lartje proportion of cases the patient's increase in weight is chie to 
the retention of water in the tissues, and this retention is due to 
the presence of chloride of sodium. With a milk diet (always 
assuming that no salt is added to the milk) the system loses more 
chloride of sodimn than is taken up, and the loss of fluid by the tissues 
is due to tlie diminution of sodium chloride. Strauss found that 
every 6 grammes (c)2-5 grains) of sodium chloride excreted meant 
a loss of about i litre (35 ounces) of water from the tissues. Belli 
found that after the conclusion of the " cure " some patients put on 
weight when they returned to a mixed diet even of low calorie value, 
which he attributes to the fact that there is a partial retention of 
sodium chloride as soon as the patient begins to take the ordinary 
condiment al quantity; and therefore such people should be for- 
bidden to eat more than a minimum amount of salt with their food. 

3. Partial Milk Diet. — 'Jhere are several interpretations of this 
phrase — e.g., the " milk days " of Roemheld form a partial milk 
diet; the ordinary sick diet consisting of milk, eggs, beef-tea, jelly, 
etc., is also a partial milk diet. A partial milk diet is also that 
which includes the addition of i or 2 pints of milk to an ordinary 
mixed diet. This is probably the best treatment for a very large 
proportion of all cases of mal-nutrition, neurasthenia, general 
debility, and phthisis. Two pints of milk daily, added to the ordi- 
nary food, is the usual amount prescribed, but more may be taken 
if the patient can consume it. In very many cases the patient 
cannot consume more than 2 pints, and an attempt to force it upon 
them results in their refusing their meals, which the milk is intended 
to supplement and not to replace. Most patients, however, can 
take porridge and milk, besides milk-tea, milk-coffee, or milk-cocoa 
for breakfast, a tu.mblerful of milk at it a.m., another between 
3 and 7 p.m., and a final one at bedtime. 

4. The Whey Cure.- — Whey is the liquid which remains after the 
precipitation of casein by rennin, as in cheese-making. It is a 
thin, almost transparent, liquid of a pleasant sweetish taste. It 
contains i to 1-25 per cent, of proteins (casein and albumin), 0-3 to 
0-5 per cent, of fat, and 3-5 to 50 per cent, of sugar, with the ordinary 
salts of milk, including CaO 0-5, and P2O5OI03, per cent. Accord- 
ing to Atwater, the heat value is only 156 calories per pint. It has 
always been considered a nutritive beverage, useful in the treatment 
of disease, and as a diluent of cow's milk for feeding infants. It is 
easily digested, is usually bland and unirritating to the stomach, but 
it may cause flatulence and acidity in people who are subject to 
those troubles, and it causes infants to have green stools. It is 
diuretic in proportion to the percentage of lactose. It is useful in 
the treatment of abdominal plethora, and the catarrhal conditions 
of the alimentary canal common to it ; also for bronchial or laryngeal 
catarrh, renal and dropsical affections, jaundice, enteric fever, and 
other febrile ailments. 

^^'hey is easily obtainable from cheese-factories durirg the season, 
but at other times, and at a distance from such a source, it is pre-

pared on a smaller scale. The milk is warmed to not more tlian 
i')4'^ F. , rennet, rennet powder, liquid rennet, or a solution of com- 
mercial junket tablet is added in the proportions directed on the 
label, just as in the making' of junket. It is sufficiently coagulated 
in thirty minutes; the coagulum is then ])roken up with a fork 
and strained through muslin; li pints of milk will yield i pint of 
whey, which contains rather more protein and fat than that ob- 
tained in the process of cheese-making. 

The whey cure is carried out at Ems, Ischl, Reichenhall, and 
other places, where a pint of whey is given daily in combination 
with a mixed diet of low calorie value, in which the animal foods 
are reduced and vegetable foods increased. Many of the cases 
treated by the whey cure in these places could be treated in the 
same manner at home. It has been recommended that the patient 
should begin by taking a tumblerful of whey morning and night, 
and increase the amount by one tumblerful each day until ten 
tumblerfuls are consumed. It may be taken warm or cold, or aerated 
by the addition of a small proportion of seltzer or soda water, or put 
into a seltzogene and aerated with a cartridge of CO2. It has been 
recommended as a sole diet in t\T)hoid fever, in doses of 6 ounces 
every two hours. Many cases of typhoid fever end fatally owing to 
their inability to digest milk, to intestinal fermentation and dis- 
tension, which are said to favour haemorrhage and perforation. 
Cautley considers that such consequences never occur when the 
diet consists only of whey, the passage of undigested food being 
prevented and distension being very rare; and, when digestive 
troubles occur in the course of typhoid fever, the adoption of a 
whey diet will relieve them. It is only necessary to point out the 
extremely low calorie value of whey to show that it is unsuitable as 
a sole diet for any length of time; that during absolute rest in bed 
the body expends at least 1,600 calories, which could only be sup- 
plied by the consumption of 10 pints of whey per diem. The use of 
whey as a diluent of cow's milk is very useful in many cases of 
illness, and especially in the gastric and intestinal affections of 
infants, and in ordinary feeding of children. 

5. Biillcrmilk has also been used as a " cure " for the same diseases 
as are treated by the whey cure. It is the liquid which remains 
behind after the manufacture of butter from ripened cream — that 
is, cream which is not less than twenty-four hours old. According 
to Atwater, the average composition of buttermilk is — Water qi, 
nitrogenous matters 3, fat 0-5, sugar 4-8, salts 07, per cent., and it 
has a heat value of 201 calories per pint. The composition, how- 
ever, varies, and the heat value varies correspondingly. According 
to Blyth, Richmond, Salge, and others, the protein ranges from 
2-5 to 3-8 per cent., the fat from 0-5 to 1-25 per cent., the sugar from 
3 to 4-8 per cent., and the heat value from 170 to 265 calories per 
pint. Buttennilk can be made on a small scale by means of acentri- 
fuge, the cream being heated to 60 or 70° F. , and agitated in it for 
fifteen minutes. A small glass chum of 2 or 3 pints'capacity may be

ii^cd. Il is a pleasant fluid of subacid taste, containing milk sugar, 
casein in a finely divided condition, and lactic acid as well as lactic 
acid bacilli. It can be consumed at one meal or in tumblerfuls 
during the day, the unconsumed buttennilk being kept in a cold 
place or on ice. When it is taken raw, the lactic acid and its bac- 
teria are both consumed, and the casein forms very fine flocculi, 
which are acceptable to the stomach. Buttermilk is suitable as 
a beverage in febrile conditions, as a cure in plethoric conditions, 
also in gastro-enteritis and other intestinal disorders, for which the 
high degree of acid is beneficial ; and it is especially suitable to assist 
in the feeding of infants during the summer-time, when the stools 
are sour and foul, in green diarrhcx^a, and after recovery from acute 
diarrho-'a- Nutricia is condensed buttemiilk sold under that name, 
and is of value when fresh buttemiilk cannot be obtained. 

6. The Sour-Milk Cure. — ]Milk freshly drawn from the cow is am- 
photeric, the acid sodium phosphate in it turning neutral litmus 
red, and the alkaline sodium phosphate turning it blue; but the 
reaction becomes more and more acid on exposure to the air, owing 
to the development therein of various acid-producing bacteria. 
These bacteria are not exactly normal to the milk, but it is practi- 
cally impossible to draw milk from a cow which is perfectly free 
from them ; they exist in the galactiferous ducts, and are always 
present in the atmosphere of the byres, and commonly present in 
that of houses. The chief of these bacteria is Hueppe's lactic acid 
bacillus, an organism i/x long and o-oo^fi broad. It multiplies 
rapidly in milk at a temperature between io° and 45° C. (50° to 
113° F.) ; and by means of enzymes, lactase and endolactase, it trans- 
forms the lactose into lactic acid. The multiplication of bacteria and 
production of acid goes on until the lactic acid reaches the proportion 
of I to 1-5 per cent. When the maximum production is reached, 
the growth and multiplication of the bacteria ceases, owing to the 
bactericidal power of lactic acid. In the meantime, the milk 
becomes sour, and coagulates spontaneously with the fonnation 
of a solid mass of casein which gradually contracts and squeezes out 
the whey in the form of a greenish-yellow fluid. Hueppe's bacillus, 
though the most common one, is not the only micro-organism 
which produces lactic acid and turns the milk sour. Other lactic- 
acid-producing organisms have been described by Hueppe, Krueger, 
Massol, Weigmann, Grotenfelt, and Markmann, including bacilli, 
micrococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and several of these 
organisms were found to exist simultaneously. 

The sour-milk cure is exceedingly ancient, but it is probably 
not so ancient as sour milk as a food. In Russia, Tartary, Bulgaria, 
Roumania, Turkey, Arabia, and Egypt, various forms of sour milk 
have been used for food from time immemorial. In Scotland sour 
milk is frequently consumed with porridge. In some parts of the 
United States sour milk, or clabber, is commonly eaten. Several 
forms of sour milk have special names and are prepared in a par- 
ticular manner, instead of the spontaneous souring which is common

to all milk. Sonic of the most common forms arc as follows: 
Koumiss is the fermented milk of mares and asses, used extensively 
h\' the inhabitants of l^ussiaand Tartary. Kephir is the fermented 
milk of cows or goats, and is likewise extensively used by the inhabi- 
tants of the Caucasus. Yaourte (youghourt), or leben, is the fer- 
mented cow's milk commonly eaten all over the Lc\-ant, Egypt, 
Arabia, and adjoining countries. 

Home-Made Sour Milk. — Sour milk, having somewhat the charac- 
teristics of yaourte, or leben, can now be prepared in the home. 
Numerous cultures of the Bulgarian bacillus and others are sold 
conunercially in the form of tablets and liquids, which have trade 
names. Many of them are exceedingly useful, and, being prepared 
from pure cultures of the bacteria, are guaranteed to be free from 
undesirable organisms. The following table shows the average 
composition of various forms of sour milk, derived from analyses 
by Hammarston, Fleischmann, Hartier, Sharp, Stange, Dujardin- 
Beaumetz, Wanklyn, Richmond, etc. :

Sour-milk preparations are valuable as foods in proportion to 
their content of protein, fat, and carbohydrate. The protein is 
partially digested by the enzymes, the total amount being about 
the same as in milk. Alexe^er analyzed the composition of the 
proteins in cow's milk and kephir made from it ; the proteins of milk 
consist of casein 87-3, albumin 8-2, and hemialbumose 4-5, per 
cent.; those of kephir consist of casein 8i-68, albumin 3-02, acid 
albumin 6-73, hemialbumose 7-84, and peptones 083, per cent. 
In consequence of these changes, kephir is more easily digested than 
cow's milk. Some of the fat is split into fatty acids, butyric acid 
appearing among them. Mare's and ass's milk contain less fat than 
cow's milk, and for that reason are better digested- Part of the sugar 
is transformed into lactic acid. Kephir, therefore, is nutritive, but 
not to the same extent as milk; it is diuretic and laxative, but pre- 



222 SrECIAL DIETS 

\ents intestinal putnlaction by nicajis of its lactic acid and bacilli; 
it is mildly stimulating by virtue of the small proportion of alcohol; 
the carbonic acid gas is a sedative to the mucous membrane of the 
stomach, but encourages gastric secretion. 

Koumiss and kephir are nutritive in proportion to their contents. 
Atwater found that when prepared from cow's milk and sugar they 
contain protein 2-8, fat 2-i, sugar 5-4 (including cane-sugar 4-4), 
and alcohol 076, per cent. ; and have a heat value of 240 calories per 
pt)und, or 300 calories per pint. The casein is precipitated in line 
tiakes, being partly converted into peptones and proteoses, and is 
easily digested. The lactic acid augments the digestive powers, 
regulates mucous secretion, and increases diuresis. The small 
amount of alcohol promotes the assimilation of fat, gives heat, and 
at the same time tends to lower the temperature and encourage 
sleep. The carbonic acid gas allaj's nausea, calms gastric irritation, 
increases the flow of urine, diminishes the frequency of the heart, 
and at the same time augments its force. These forms of fermented 
milk are useful as an aid in the treatment of phthisis, tuberculosis, 
chronic gastric catarrh, chronic intestinal catarrh, colitis, ileo- 
colitis, auto-intoxication, diseases of the hepatic, urinar}', and ner- 
vous systems ; also in anaemia and other forms of malnutrition. 

The koumiss or kephir " cure " is carried out in various estab- 
lishments in and about Ssamara and other places in the Steppes of 
Orenberg. In these institutions an ordinary allowance of koumiss 
is 7 pints (4 litres) per diem. The patients rise early and take a 
glassful of koumiss every half-hour throughout the day, excepting 
for two hours before dinner and supper. The amount of nutriment 
contained in 7 pints of koumiss made from cow's milk would be 
112 grammes of protein, 84 grammes of fat, 216 grammes of carbo- 
hydrate, and 30 grammes of alcohol, and would yield 2,100 calories. 
The same amount of kephir from goat's milk would yield about 
2,500 calories; it is therefore a large contribution to the dietary. 
At first, however, only a few glassfuls of kephir or koumiss per day 
are allowed until tolerance is established, because of its tendency 
to cause diarrhoea, which may require the addition of lime-water 
to check it. It is well and easily assimilated, but only one case 
was found by Alexeyer in which kephir alone was sufficient to main- 
tain the nitrogenous metabolism, and that was a healthy young 
man who consumed only 5^ pints daily for two days. During the 
" cure " the rest of the diet consists of meat and fat ; carbohydrates, 
especially sweets, ices, fruit, vegetables, salads, coffee, and spirits 
are excluded. The amount of koumiss or kephir prescribed, added 
to a concentrated diet of protein and fat, together with an out-of- 
door life in the bracing air of the Steppes, must be advantageous 
to many cases of early phthisis, tuberculosis, insomnia, nervous 
affeciions, gastro-intestinal and hepatic diseases, and various forms 
of malnutrition. The severity of the winter in these regions would 
preclude many Europeans from going there at that period ol the 
year; but the success of treatment at high altitudes in other parts

by k(uiini>s or kej)hir can be carried out on the same lines. 

Nitrogen-free Diet (full and modified). — A nitrogen-free diet can 
be made of starch, sugar, salt, and almond-oil or other fat; these 
articles can be made into a palatable cake, leavened with baking- 
powder. Plain water or spirit and water can be taken as a beverage. 
There is at present no therapeutic use for a nitrogen-free diet, nor 
is it conceivable that it could be taken for any length of time. It 
has been used chiefly for experimental purposes, especially when 
making observations on the metabolism of nitrogen. When a man 
consumed a nitrogen-free diet for three days, I.ehmann found that 
he excreted daily 7-4 grammes of nitrogen. In a similar experi- 
ment lasting eleven days, Reider found that the average excretion 
of nitrogen in the urine was 87 grammes, and the fa;ces contained 
0-9 gramme, which was equivalent to a loss of 56 grammes of 
protein daily. It is unknown how much " floating protein " there 
is in any human organism ; it varies from day to day; but it may be 
assumed that all the floating protein would be consumed in a few 
days, and after three or four days the excreted nitrogen would 
arise from the destruction of " tissue- proteins," which is seldom or 
never desirable. There is a physiological minimum to the amount 
of nitrogen required daily, and it is not safe to continue to take food 
containing less than that amount, otherwise the muscular tissues 
must waste. 

If it should ever be considered advisable to clear the system of 
" floating protein," it may be done by giving a comparatively 
nitrogen-free diet for about four days. The diet might be selected 
from foods containing less than 05 per cent, of protein — e.g., arrow- 
root-starch, corn-starch, sugar, honey, and oil such as sweet almond 
or cottonseed oil; or from foods containing 0-5 to i-o per cent, of 
protein, such as manioc-starch, arrowroot, sago, tapioca, apples, 
pears, rhubarb, melon, nmsk-melon, plums, raspberries, straw- 
berries, gooseberries, oranges, lemons, tomatoes, cucumber, radishes, 
turnips, carrots. The following foods contain from i to about 
1-5 per cent, of protein: grapes, bananas, leeks, onions, cabbage, 
cauliflower, parsnips, rutagagas, pumpkins, squash, sauerkraut, 
celery, pickles, horseradish, tomato-catsup; margarine contains 
about 1-2, butter i to 1-5, a nd suet a minimum of i, per cent. 
Asparagus contains i-8, potatoes 2, string or kidney beans 23, and 
artichokes 2-6, per cent. Lard contains 2-2, thick cream, 2-~), fat 
salt pork 20, ham fat 2-8, and bone-marrow 2-3, per cent, of protein. 
Spirits contain no protein, and the amount in wine is practically 
negligible, and an infusion of cereal coffee (i in 20) contains only 
0-2 per cent, of protein. The choice of foods is large, and such a 
diet, while yielding sufficient energy, would speedily result in a 
clearance of superfluous protein materials. After taking a diet 
consisting of the foregoing fruits and vegetables for four days, 
some bread, rice, oatmeal, milk pudding, or soup, may be added to 
the list. The amount of protein in these foods is as follows: Beef 



±24 SPECIAL DIETS 

soup 4, meat stew (when meat is taken out) 4-6, oxtail soup 4-0, 
chicken broth 3-6, tomato soup i-8, vegetable soup 2-8, milk 3-5, 
boiled rice 2-8, boiled oatmeal (thick) 2-8, brown bread 5-5, white 
bread 8 or 9, zwiebach 98, per cent. The return to the ordinary 
diet, or one containing at least 55 grammes of protein dail3% should 
not be deferred longer than the eighth day. 

Purin-free Diet. — The purin bodies are nitrogenous substances 
which contain the group C5X4; they include uric acid, xanthin, hypo- 
Xiuithin, adenin, guanin, and methyl-xanthin (caflein and theo- 
bromin). These bodies arise from nucleo-proteins, which are normal 
constituents of the nucleus and protoplasm of cells. In the animal 
system the nucleo-proteins are split into nuclein and protein; the 
nuclein is again divided into nucleic acid and protein ; and the nucleic 
acid into purin bodies, phosphoric acid, etc. This is the normal order 
of metabolism of nucleo-proteins, and it occurs in animals as well 
as human begins. Consequently purin bodies exist ready-formed 
in many of our foods, especially those of the animal kingdom. 

The synthesis of purins begins in the embryo, and was studied 
by Mendel during the incubation of eggs. Beginning with fresh 
eggs, free from purins, he found that the quantity of purins increased 
gradually during the incubation period until they were hatched. 
The specific purins synthetized as part of the newly formed nucleo- 
protein are guanin and adenin. The process of purin- format ion 
goes on throughout life as a part of the cell metabolism, but the 
transformation of purins likewise goes on constantly. A number 
of enz5nnes co-operate in the transformation of the purin-containing 
materials. Thus, nucleases liberate guanin and adenin from 
nucleic acids; amidases convert these amino-purins into xanthin 
and hypoxanthin respectively; and oxidases transform hypoxanthin 
to xanthin, and then to uric acid ; and the latter is finally decomposed 
by uricolytic enzymes present in various organs. 

It is evident, therefore, that certain purin bodies are constantly 
being produced wherever cellular processes are in active operation, 
and although these are normally converted into other materials 
which are more easily excreted, all animal foods must contain some 
of them. Lean meat, the flesh of mammals, birds, and fish, con- 
tains xanthin, hypoxanthin, and uric acid, besides urea, creatin, 
creatinin, and other extractives. Liver is rich in nuclein, xanthin, 
lu-poxanthin, uric acid, urea, and all other nitrogenous extractives. 
Spleen (milt) also contains nuclein, xanthin, hypoxanthin, uric acid, 
lecithin, creatinin, leucin, and tyrosin. Thymus (chest sweetbread) 
contains nuclein, xanthin, hypoxanthin, guanin, and adenin in 
excess. Pancreas (bell}' sweetbread) contains the same kinds of 
purins, besides leucin, tyrosin, and other amino-acids. Kidneys 
contain urea, uric acid, xanthin, hypoxanthin, taurin, leucin, creatin, 
creatinin, etc Beef-tea, soup, and gravy contain the same kinds 
of purins and extractives as the substances from which they are 
derived. Vegetable foods, especially seeds, contain nucleo-proteins, 
nuclein, nucleic acid, and purin bodies, with amino-acids such as 



PirRIS^-FRf-r: DIET 225 

asparagin, leucin, tyrosin, etc. Tea, coffee, and kola contain 
caffein or trimethyl xanthin — that is, xanthin with three methyl 
groups in its molecule; cocoa contains theobromin or dimethyl 
xanthin; and guarana contains botii caflcin and theobromin. 

The purins which are consumed with the food are caMcd exogoions 
purins. But every healthy individual excretes a certain charac- 
teristic amount of purins which is independent of the food. This 
is the result of the metabolism of his own tissues, and hence is called 
the endogenous purins. The amount of purins excreted in the urine 
due to endogenous formation may he estimated after taking a 
purin-free diet for a few days; and it varies in most people from 
o-i to 0-2 gramme daily. ^ Of this amount 50 per cent, is trans- 
formed, mainly into urea b}^ the liver, and 50 per cent, is eliminated 
unchanged — i.e., as uric acid, xanthin, hypoxanthin, etc., by the 
kidneys. The exogenous purins are also partly transformed in the 
body, 30 per cent, being excreted as urea, the remaining portion being 
excreted b}' the kidneys as xanthin, hypoxanthin, uric acid, etc. 

On ordinary diet the excretion of purins is necessarily increased 
by the exogenous or nutrition purin. According to Burian and 
Schurr, all the exogenous purin does not pass out of the body, a 
fraction remaining in the organism or becoming entirely broken 
down by oxidases in various organs. The amount of exogenous 
purin in the urine is but little influenced by the individuality of the 
subject. (liven the same kind and amount of food, the purin 
excretion is practically the same in normal individuals; but it is 
much inlluenced by the kind of food. Burian and Schurr found 
the purin bodies in beef and veal to be o-i6, calf's liver o-i2, calf's 
spleen o-i6, calf's thymus 0-4, and coffee 0-2, per cent.; and when 
eaten alone, they caused an excretion of exogenous purin in the 
following proportion: Beef and veal 0-03, liver o-o6, spleen o-8, 
thymus o-i, and coffee 0-075, per cent.^ Walker Hall has given 
special attention to the purin bodies. He gave an estimate of the 
amount in various foods (see table on p. 226).^ 

It is clear, however, that all the purins in the food are not ab- 
sorbed. Although Burian and Schurr found that, with the same 
amount and kind of food, the exogenous purin in the urine is practi- 
cally the same in all persons, there is a personal equation in the 
matter, as Walker HaU found, with regard to absorption. There 
is a normal daily excretion of purin bodies in the faeces, called the 
fcBcal purin, to distinguish it from that excreted by the kidneys, 
called the urinary purin. The amount of faecal purin varies with 
the kind of food, and is greater where substances are eaten which 
are rich in nuclein and purin derivatives: thus, when a person 
consumed 500 grammes of sweetbread, 60 per cent, of the purin 
bodies were absorbed and 40 per cent, voided in the faeces. The 
amount of nitrogen excreted daily in the faeces on an ordinary diet 
is about 1-39 grammes daily, of which 0-9 gramme is due to metabol-

ism of the tissues, ami tlie remainder from the residue of the food. 
Given the same diet, the same individual normally excretes the 
same amount of purin bodies in the faeces daily- This has to be 
estimated in experiments upon metabolism, but clinically small 
variations are generally neglected. The amount of purin in the 
faeces may be increased in diarrhoea and intestinal catarrh by 
shedding the cells of the mucous membrane; similarly there may 
be a slight increase in the output of purins owing to loss of nuclein 
in bronchial and pharyngeal catarrh, and purulent conditions of the 
lungs, and in catarrh of the bladder. But the remaining tissue cells 
pass all their nuclein derivatives into the circulating fluids of the 
body, reaching the liver in the usual way, and are the chief source 
of the endogenous purin formation.

All cell metabolism is attended by changes of a destructive char- 
acter. Carbon is oxidized, and forms carbon dioxide, hydrogen 
unites with oxygen to form water, nitrogen is burnt off, but only 
partially reduced. Urea is the chief product of protein metabolism, 
and it is formed principall}' in the liver, but it is very probable that 
other cellular organs, such as the spleen and lymphatic glands. 
participate in its formation. Creatin, one of the chief products of 



PURINS IX FOODS 227 

muscular metabolism, is considered an important intermediate body 
in the fonnation of urea. Uric acid is regarded as another of the 
intermediate bodies, and this is supported by the fact that urea 
can be artificially produced from uric acid. The amino-acids, 
leucin, tyrosin, gljxocin, etc., are also considered to be intermediate 
bodies in the formation of urea, and the thesis receives support 
from the fact that the amount of these amino-acids in the urine is 
increased in acute yellow atrophy of the liver. 

Uric acid, next to urea, is the most important nitrogenous 
material excreted by manmials, and yet the amount only reaches 
0-5 to 0-75 gramme per diem. It is the chief nitrogenous excretion 
in birds. Roberts considered its presence in mammalian urine an 
anomaly, its place being taken by urea, which is better adapted to 
the liquid urine of mammals; uric acid in mammalian urine is there- 
fore regarded as a vestigial remnant of descent, and its excessive 
fomiation a retrograde process. Uric acid and its salts (urates) are 
the chief excretory products of birds and reptiles, apparently 
because it is more convenient for them to pass a solid urine. It is 
essential for mammalia to excrete water b}^ means of the kidneys, 
and, as urea is a more soluble material than uric acid, it is better 
suited as an excretory product to the mammalian type. It is an 
adaptation of means to an end. There are two chief views of the 
origin of uric acid: (i) That it is formed in the kidneys, (2) that it is 
formed in the tissues. The view that uric acid is fonned in the kid- 
ney's, as well as excreted by them, is chiefly supported by Garrod. 
That uric acid is fonned in the tissues is the view held by most 
authorities, and this is considered proved by the fact that there is 
always a little uric acid in the blood, liver, spleen, Ijmiphatic 
glands, and other organs; that most uric acid is excreted when the 
liver and spleen are most active; that the excretion is diminished, 
and it accumulates in the blood and tissues in gout ; and that it con- 
tinues to be formed after the removal of the kidney's. 

Whatever interferes with the formation of urea by the liver will 
cause an increase in the amount of purins per se which have to be 
excreted, as nomially half the purins are transfomied into urea by 
the liver, and the other half excreted as purin by the kidneys. 
Whatever interferes with the excretory function of the kidneys will 
lead to a retention of purins in the body. Whatever causes a 
reduction of the oxidative processes in the body will interfere with 
the reduction of the purins in the tissues to less noxious forms of 
excretory products. The persistent consumption of foods con- 
taining a large percentage of purin bodies is apt to lead to their 
accumulation in the organism. So long as the liver can transform 
and the kidneys excrete purin bodies, no harm, it may be thought, 
will follow. But a constant irritation of the kidneys by an 
excess of purins, especially uric acid, may result in chronic nephritis 
of the gouty variety, with other evidences of chronic gout. The 
retention of purins in the system is amongst the recognized causes 
of gout, rheumatic gout, uric acid gravel, uric acidicmia, migraine,

neuralgia, sciatica, epilepsy, vascular diseases, and many other 
conditions of ill-health. 

In this group of diseases the treatnient frequently includes the 
use of a puriu-frcc diet. The following foods practically contain no 
purin : 5lilk, cheese, cream, butter, eggs, white bread, macaroni, 
rice, sago, tapioca, cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, watercress, fruit, 
sugar, honey, marmalade, jam, sherry, port, volnay, and claret. It 
is a milk and fruit diet, with bread-and-butter, milk puddings, and 
salads added to it. Strictly speaking, milk and its derivatives 
contain traces of purin. Potatoes and onions contain very little, 
and are allowed. Oatmeal, peameal, and malted lentils contain 
only 2-5 to 3-5 grains per pound. Tripe, cod-fisji, plaice, and neck 
of pork contain only 4 or 5 grains per pound, and the}' are aften 
allowed in small quantities. Asparagus contains little purins, but 
nmch asparagin, which is a valuable protein-sparer. Peas, beans, 
and lentils only contain 4 or 5 per cent, of purins, but they also 
contain nucleo-proteins which are converted into purins in the 
body. The following articles are usually forbidden altogether: Tea, 
coi^ee, cocoa, kola, guarana; fish, fowl, and butcher's meat; brown 
bread (wholemeal bread), peas, beans, asparagus; ale, stout, and 
lager beer. Water and milk are allowed; buttermilk, whey, kou- 
miss, kephir, cider, perr}^ and a small quantity of spirits, claret, 
sherry, or volnay, may also be allowed unless they are contra-indi- 
cated on other grounds than the presence of purins. 

Fat- free Diet.- — It has been recognized for a long time that the 
presence of an excess of fat, and especially butter, in the contents 
of the stomach will check the secretion of gastric juice; and advan- 
tage is taken of this fact in the treatment of hyperchlorhydria. 
Conversely, the absence of fat from the food allows a more generous 
secretion of gastric juice, including hydrochloric acid. In various 
gastric ailments there is a condition of h3^pochlorhydria — that is to 
say, the normal proportion of hydrochloric acid is not present. In 
consequence of the diminution of free hydrochloric acid, the mucous 
membrane of the stomach becomes infected by micro-organisms, 
which give rise to catarrh, organic acidity, atony of the muscular 
coat, and dilatation. The proportion of free hydrochloric acid in 
the gastric juice is likewise diminished in carcinoma wherever it 
may be situated; and it is considered by some authorities that the 
cachexia produced by this disease is a consequence of the subnutri- 
tion resulting from hypochlorhydria. 

It is obvious that no antiseptic mixture could be given which 
would penetrate to all the folds and crypts of the mucous membrane. 
But hydrochloric acid is serceted by the mucous membrane; it is a 
valuable antiseptic, and is more active in its nascent form than 
when administered as a drug. It is argued, therefore, that the 
removal of fat from the food encourages a freer secretion of gastric 
juice, that such juice contains a greater proportion of free hydro- 
chloric acid, and that the nascent acid comes first into contact with 
the crypts of the mucous membrane, which it slowly but surely • 



FAT-I'REE DIET 229 

disinfects, while at the same time it gives tone to the muscular coat. 
A fat-free diet, therefore, must be of value in hypochlorhydria, 
catarrh, atony, and dilatation of the stomach, and in carcinoma of 
the stomach and other organs. 

Fat-free foods are sugar, honey, treacle, starch, dextrin, beef-tea, 
meat extracts, casein preparations, the white of eggs, and a few 
others. It is almost impossible to provide an absolutely fat-free 
diet, nor is it conceivable that such a diet would ever be essential. 
But we can approximate to it by removing as much fat as possible 
from the meat and milk, and avoiding the use of butter, suet, and 
other fats and oils. The diet may be selected from the following 
list, many of the foods containing less than one-half ^ex cent. : 

Foods containing 0'$ per cent, or less: Skim milk, casein powders, 
sugar, corn-starch, arrowroot, sago, tapioca, green peas, string 
beans, potatoes, parsnips, carrots, turnips, radishes, beetroot, 
salsify, scorzonera, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels-sprouts, spinach, 
vegetable marrow, squash, asparagus, tomatoes, mushrooms, 
truffles, onions, leeks, celery, lettuce, watercress, cucumber, rhu- 
barb; apples, pears, peaches, plums, strawberries, raspberries, 
gooseberries, currants, melons, musk-melons, water-melons, oranges; 
litchi nuts; and the white of eggs. 

Foods containing less than i per cent, of Fat : In addition to the 
foregoing — fine white flour, white bread, ryemeal and rye bread, 
beef-tea, meat extracts, beef broth, meat stews when skimmed, 
tomato soup, oxtail soup, mulligatawny soup, pea soup, gumbo 
soup. Turtle, frog's legs, oysters, clams, scallops, crab, crayfish, 
shrimps. Fish: bass, cod, cusk, flounder, haddock, hake, yellow 
perch, perch-pike, grey pike, pickerel-pike, pollock, red grouper, 
and red snapper. 

Foods with I to 2 per cent, of Fat : Sole, plaice, smelt, sturgeon, 
weak-fish, skate, blue-fish, black-fish, king-fish. Venison, partridge, 
breast of boiled fowl ; wheat, brown bread, wholemeal bread, buck- 
wheat flour, macaroni, vermicelli, haricot and navy beans, dried 
peas, frijoles, green corn; grapes, bananas. 

The food, therefore, should consist largely of bread, treacle, mar- 
malade; white of eggs, meat extracts, soups, broths, mushrooms, 
oysters, light fish, lean meat, fowl or partridge, potatoes, vegetables, 
and fruits. All substances containing the meat bases or extractives 
provoke the secretion of gastric juice. Fatty foods and spices are 
to be avoided. 

Carbohydrate-free Diet. — A diet free from starch, sugar, and other 
carbohydrates is recommended for the cure of gastric ailments, 
rheumatism, gout, diabetes, uric-acidaemia, and various other 
ailments. The usual form is that of the Salisbury diet — meat, green 
vegetables, and hot water — which has been discussed under the head 
of meat cures. A strict diabetic diet answers very well as a carbo- 
hydrate-free diet, and will be found under Diabetes. 

Salt-free Diet. — It has been observed that certain pathological 
conditions are more readily improved when common salt is with-

held from the diet, and reports thereon have been made for some 
years. The conditions in which it has been found most beneficial 
to withhold sodium chloride are drops}- from cardiac, renal, or 
hepatic diseases, various other forms of oedema, pleuritic effusions of 
a non-febrile character, obesity, diabetes insipidus, and epilepsy. 

In prescribing a limitation of the intake of salt it is not intended 
to make the rule absolute. Sodium chloride is essential for the 
proper discharge of the metabolic functions. The adult human 
body normally contains about 200 grammes of it. It is an impor- 
tant food, as well as a condiment, for something like 15 or 20 
grammes leave the body daily in the urine, and small c^uantities in the 
perspiration and fa:ces. The presence of chloride of sodium in the 
food facilitates the absorption of proteins, and assists in the metabol- 
ism of the same. During early life sodium salts are much used in 
the growth of the cartilages, and are of more importance as tissue- 
formers at this period than in adult hfe. But it cannot be done 
without, for if potassium chloride be substituted for the sodium 
salt, various disturbances arise from deficiency of the latter. The 
tissues, however, retain sodium chloride very tenaciously, and when 
it is withheld from the food, very little passes out by the kidneys. 
It is possible that under certain conditions the faculty of retaining 
sodium chloride is abnormally pronounced, and the presence of an 
undue amount of salt in the S3^stem leads to pathological conditions, 
the undue retention of the salt being a sign of enfeebled metabolism, 
and is believed to be a cause of a-dcma and dropsy. 

It is estimated that the average consumption of salt amounts to 
15 or 20 grammes a da}', and corresponds to the amount excreted by 
the kidneys. It is undesirable that the food should be absolutely 
salt-free, and it is almost impossible to prepare food quite free from 
it. The following table of the percentage of sodium chloride in 
raw and cooked foods is chiefly from an article by H. Strauss on the 
best method of reducing the amount of salt in the diet :^

SALT-FREE DIET 23X 

chloride was capable of producing oedema. It has been shown that 
if the quantity of salt is reduced to a minimum, the osmotic pressure 
of the fluids in the vessels and tissues increases, and ttdema is reduced. 
It is unknown how far the increased absorption of water after taking 
a larger quantity of salt than usual is physiological and how far it 
may be pathological. MendeP considers there is a hydrsemic 
plethora, as distinguished from true plethora, by which he means 
an increase in the amount of water in the tissues beyond the normal 
limit. Evidence of such a condition is found in the observations 
of Cohnheim and Lichtheim. But the experimental evidence as 
well as clinical facts tend to show that hydraemic plethora does not 
lead to adema so long as the heart and kidneys are in good order. 
As soon, however, as there is a failure in the circulatory system, it im- 
mediately leads to oedema; and the oedema of acute and chronic 
nephritis and cardiac disease is primarily due to the existence of 
hydnemic plethora. The great value of the milk cure in these con- 
ditions is now well estabhshed. But there is not a general agree- 
ment as to the cause of the improvement following the milk diet. 
It has been ascribed to the happy blending of the nutriments in the 
fluid, to the diuretic action of the lactose, to the absence of irri- 
tating substances, to the reduction of energy spent by the heart 
during the treatment, and to the effect the milk has in improving the 
tone of the cardiac muscle. Romberg and his followers, however, 
consider these effects are secondary, and the primary therapeutic 
effect of the milk is due to the almost complete absence of chloride 
of sodium. Milk contains but i-6 grammes of sodium chloride per 
litre, and this small amount of salt is the reason for its value in 
cases of obesity without oedema or disturbance of the circulatory 
system, as well as in nephritic and cardiac diseases with oedema. 
Mendel argues that if the beneficial effect of a milk diet in these 
cases is really due to the poverty of milk in sodium chloride, the 
same effects would follow any other diet with a corresponding 
reduction in the amount of common salt. Clinical facts support 
his contention. For example: A patient who was suffering from 
myocarditis with dropsy was put on a milk diet; the quantity of 
urine increased, the ascites and anasarca disappeared. After a 
period of time the symptoms recurred, and, as the patient objected 
to the milk diet, the food now prescribed consisted of milk, meat, 
bread, butter, potatoes, and fruit, but with a minimum of salt. The 
oedema disappeared as rapidly as it had done with a milk diet. 
Other cases showed that the excessive consumption of salt was 
chiefly responsible for the appearance of dropsy. Mendel does not 
recommend that the prescription of salt-free diet should be abso- 
lute; but he considers the amount of salt should be limited to 2 to 
4 grammes daily, and this is the quantity which is obtained on a 
milk diet without any added salt. During acute illness, such as 
pneumonia, fevers, and so forth, adults stand an exclusive milk 
diet very well; but there are many persons who cannot take it 

' Mi'mch. Med. Woch., March 2 and 9, 1909. 



232 SPECIAL DIETS 

except for a short time, and therefore another diet must be devised 
for them, and generally for persons who need a prolonged limitation 
of salt. 

Ordinary bread contains from i^ to 2 grammes or more of 
common salt per pound; it is therefore advisable that bread be 
made without salt; if it is considered unpleasant, it should be eaten 
with marmalade, jam, treacle, or honey. Butter usually contains 
5 or 6 grammes of salt per pound, and should be prepared without 
salt for these patients. The greatest hardship is usually experienced 
in respect to meat. Fresh meat usually contains about 2 grammes 
of salt per pound, but the majorit}- of people use a considerable 
quantity of salt as a condiment when eating it. This must be 
checked, even if it means a reduction in the aiuount of meat. Meat 
broths and extracts should also be limited for the same reason. But 
very frequently there are other reasons which necessitate a reduction 
in the consumption of butcher's meat, fish, game, poultry, soups, 
or broths. The protein, therefore, should be derived from sources 
which require the use of very little condiment ; these are milk, milk 
puddings, eggs in the form of custard, creams, souffle, omelettes made 
with sugar, eggs in egg-sauce or salad, poached eggs, and buttered 
eggs. Soups and meat jell}^ can be flavoured with mint, thyme, 
marjoram, parsley, celer}', bayleaf, or savory. Cheese can be 
prepared with very little salt ; cottage cheese, cream cheese, lactic 
acid cheese, Devonshire cream, may all be taken. There is no 
objection to puddings or pastry without salt, and they are not 
objectionable when eaten with cooked fruit. \'arious sauces can 
be used as condiments to the meat — e.g., horseradish, vinegar, 
curry paste or powder, and vinegar sauce (vinegar, mustard, and 
sugar mixed together). One of the greatest difticuities is with 
regard to vegetables; potatoes, artichokes, carrots, parsnips, 
cabbage, cauliflower, and most other vegetables are considered 
unpalatable when no salt is used in the cooking, and therefore such 
vegetables must either be eaten without salt or only in very small 
amount until it is considered safe to increase the intake of sodium 
chloride. 

The following is the diet recommended by Carducci^ for dropsy 
due to renal disease: 2 J pints of milk, 300 grammes of meat (cooked 
and eaten without salt), and 300 grammes of salt-free bread, 
yielding 2,180 calories daily. This diet would contain about 
3 grammes of sodium chloride, and it should be persevered with 
until the oedema is gone. Meanw'hile the patient should remain 
in bed, and the excretion of sodium chloride watched by a frequent 
examination of the urine. The weight of the patient's body is a 
good guide to the effect of the diet: the weight usually sinks, the 
urine increases in amount, and the oedema diminishes. When the 
oedema is gone, the amount of sodium chloride can be increased 
by 3 grammes daily by giving come fresh-water fish, a little bacon 
or fat ham, or a trace of salt with eggs or vegetables such as potato 

' Brit. Med. Jour., 1906, ii., epitome 164. 



SALT-FREE DIET 233 

or cauliflower. But Carducci strongly recommended that the 
urine should be regularly examined to insure that all the sodium 
chloride in the food is eliminated, and that the quantity consumed 
is only increased in proportion to the amount eliminated. 'Ihis is 
a fair example of the salt-free diet, but it is impossible to keep the 
patient on it for a very long time. It should, however, be strictly 
carried out for two weeks, after which some vegetables should be 
allowed, to vary the monotony of the diet ; these should be cooked 
with as little salt as possible, and washed in water without salt 
before they are eaten. Vegetables usually contain only o-i per 
cent, of sodium chloride, but spinach and celery contain more. 
Boiled cabbage or cauliflower can be eaten with a small amount of 
vinegar sprinkled upon them at the time they are eaten. Salads 
can be eaten with oil or vinegar and sugar, or egg-dressing when the 
patient is well enough to consume them. 

There is no need for a salt-free diet in all cases of nephritis or 
cardiac disease, but only when they are accompanied by oedema. 
The tendency to dropsy can be determined by means of a test-diet, 
the essential thing being to find out first how much sodium chloride 
the urine of a healthy man would contain on such a diet, and 
compare the proportion eliminated by the patient with that of the 
healthy man. " If the excretion of sodium chloride is normal, 
there is no tendency to dropsy, and the consumption of salt should 
not be reduced unless the amount taken is obviously in excess of the 
needs of the organism, and even then it is not advisable to reduce 
the quantity to such an extent as to render the food unpalatable. 
In cases of heart disease it is usually sufficient to reduce the amount 
to a moderate quantity, and a very rigid salt-free diet is only needed 
in cases where there is a parenchymatous degeneration of the 
kidneys as a result of venous stasis."^ 

In obesity the effect of Karell's milk cure is believed by Romberg 
and Mendel to be due to the concurrent limitation of common salt 
in the diet. It is undoubtedly a fact that the reduction of sodium 
chloride in the food is a valuable means of reducing adiposity where 
there is oedema or disturbance of the vascular system ; this is 
chiefly due to the increased diuresis, and the diminished retention 
of water in the tissues, leading to loss of weight. Karell's milk cure 
for obesity, however, is essentially a low-nutrition dietary, the 
amount of milk allowed being only sufficient to supply one-half or 
three-quarters of the energy expended by the organism daily. 
There is, however, great benefit to be derived by persons who are 
obese, or have a tendency to embonpoint, from the reduction of 
the sodium chloride in the food. Such persons should be recom- 
mended to eat as little salt as possible with their meat and vege- 
tables, and fruit should form a portion of their diet because it contains 
onl}' about 006 per cent., or less, of chloride of sodium, and needs 
no additional salt as a condiment. 

In epileps}/ the limitation of salt in the food is an assistance in

cari\ iiig out a long course of bromide treatment. It is considered 
that chlorine-free food renders the organism more susceptible to 
the influence of bromine, that the sedative effect of bromide is 
thereby increased, while the risk of bromism is diminished. The 
following is the dietary recommended by Balint :^ milk if to 2i pints, 
butter I J to i^ ounces, 3 eggs, qi to 12^ ounces of bread daily, with 
vegetables and fruit, weak tea or coffee, and yielding 2,300 to 2,400 
calories daily. The diet contains 2 to 3 grammes of sodium chloride ; 
no salt is to be used in cooking or eating it. The bread may be 
salted by mixing 45 grains of sodium bromide with the flour of 
which each day's cake is made. Such bread is sometimes called 
Bromopan. The diet is useful in other nerve diseases where a 
course of bromide is considered desirable. 

Cellulose Diet. — Cellulose is the material which composes the 
cell walls and woody fibre of plants. It is a nutrient for the lower 
animals. The herbivora are able to digest a considerable propor- 
tion of this material, varying from 60 to 70 per cent, of the crude 
fibre of dried grasses (hay) and cereals; 47 to 62 per cent, of that in 
carrots, cabbage, and celery ; 25 per cent, of that in lettuce; but only 
4-4 per cent, that in scorzonera. Hoffmeister found that the amount 
of hippuric acid in the urine of horses increased or decreased with the 
increase or decrease in the crude fibre digested. It is probable 
that primitive man had this faculty in common with other animals. 
It has been shown that the primitive races existing to-day — the 
Bushman, Nilotic negro, and others, possess a large caecum, and 
their colon secretes an enzyme which dissolves the outer covering 
of vegetable cells; and the fluid from the vermiform appendix 
digests cellulose, evolving CH4, and producing a copper-reducing 
substance. But the civilized races of mankind have lost this 
power. Bunge, however, considers that the epitheliiuTi of the colon 
always secretes an enzyme which has a slight action on the cellulose 
coverings of cells; nevertheless he agrees with the majority of 
observers that putrefaction is practically the only change which 
cellulose or crude fibre undergoes in the human intestines, and that 
the chief function served in the human economy by it is as a me- 
chanical stimulus to peristalsis. But the importance of the exis- 
tence of this stimulus in all animals possessing a long intestinal 
canal has been proved. If rabbits are fed on a diet containing no 
cellulose, the onward movement of the intestines ceases, inflamma- 
tion ensues, and the animals rapidly die. The short intestine of 
carnivora does not require a mechanical stimulus to peristaltic 
action. The intestine of man is of a medium length, and a man's 
life is not endangered by deprivation of cellulose, although the 
movements of the intestine may thereby be impeded and a condition 
of sluggishness induced. If the muscular wall of the intestines has 
nothing to do, it is likel}^ to atrophy, like any other muscle. The 
excessive fear of indigestible foods which prevails in the minds of 
many people is largely responsible for atonic constipation and many

CEUJTJ.OSE DIET 235 

of the cases of chronic intestinal catarrh, mucous cohtis, and mem- 
branous cohtis. It is tlierefore important in the treatment of these 
diseases that the food does not lack cellulose and especially woody 
fibre. It is true that cellulose possesses irritating qualities which 
it is necessary to minimize in cases of chronic gastric and intestinal 
catarrh, intestinal ulcer, cancer, or stricture. It is also true that 
the presence of cellulose is a cause of food being hurried along the 
alimentary canal more rapidly than when this substance is absent, 
and in consequence some loss of nutriment arises. Thus, it was 
shown by Meyer ^ that more nutriment is absorbed from white 
bread than from brown or wholemeal bread; and Hoffmann showed 
that the addition of cellulose to a meat diet caused the food to be 
hurried rapidly along the canal and diminished the proportion of 
protein and fat absorbed from the meat. This irritating effect is 
desirable in cases of atony of the intestinal canal, and advantage 
should be taken of it. And the conclusion to be drawn from all 
observations is that the advantages arising from the presence of 
cellulose in the food of the average individual far outweigh the dis- 
advantages.^ 

In cases of chronic constipation, and especially those compli- 
cated with mucous colitis. Von Noorden prescribes a diet of Graham 
bread (wholemeal bread), all sorts of legumes, including the skins, 
coarse oatmeal, all kinds of vegetables containing much cellulose or 
woody fibre, fruits having thick skins and seeds (grapes, currants, 
gooseberries), and large quantities of fat, such as butter, bacon, and 
ham. He claims that this diet permanently cures 50 per cent, of 
all cases, and another 28 per cent, are much improved or partially 
cured. The following diet list may be prescribed: 

Wholemeal bread of any description, eaten with plent}^ of butter, 
bacon, fat ham, honey, treacle, or marmalade; one or two eggs 
dail}^, poached, buttered, or scrambled in preference; fat meat, 
bacon or ham for dinner, with a large proportion of dried peas, beans, 
lentils, cabbage, ceiuliflower, savoy, Brussels sprouts, turnips, 
swedes, parsnips, scorzonera, onions, leeks, and okra. Dessert 
should consist of raw or cooked fruit, especially apples, pears, 
grapes, currants, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, black- 
berries, loganberries, cranberries, and whortleberries. Plenty of 
cream should be taken with cooked fruit. Sugar is allowed. 
Peaches, plums, apricots, apples, and acid fruits in general also 
stimulate peristalsis by means of their organic acids. Oatmeal is 
of great value; the coarse meal is the best form, but oat-cakes and 
groats may also be eaten; pearl barley, barley bread, rye bread, and 
buckwheat cakes are useful. The foods which contain a com- 
paratively small amount of cellulose or fibre should be avoided. 
The patient should take plenty of liquids; hot water should be

drunk before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Milk may be con- 
sumed to the amount of i pint daily, and will assist in bringing up 
the digestible protein to near the physiological requirement.

Dry Diet. — In connection with the salt-free diet the theory of 
hydnemic plethora or hydremia was mentioned, which condition 
Mendel considers is primarily due to the retention of sodium 
chloride in the tissues, and secondarily to the hygroscopic nature 



DRY IF.T 237 

of the salt. It was shown by Cohnheim and Lichthciin lliat if a 
large amount of physiological saline thiicl is injected into tlie vessels 
of animals, no apparent changes take place; but the rate of circula- 
tion is increased until the extra amount of water has been excreted 
or the quantity of fluid in the vessels and tissues again becomes 
normal. If, lunvever, the animal is killed before sufficient time has 
elapsed for this to take place, the organs of the abdomen are found 
to be oedematous. This evidence, as well as clinical facts, tends 
to show that hydraemic plethora of itself does not lead to the reten- 
tion of fluid, but as soon as the circulatory organs become damaged, 
it immediately leads to (edema, anasarca and ascites. 

The condition of hydnemic plethora occurs in many cases of 
cardiac and renal disease, and the damaged heart suffers from an 
excess of fluids in the bod\' owing to the diminished action of the 
skin and kidneys. It is considered, therefore, that the consumption 
of the ordinary amount of fluids is injurious in these cases by distend- 
ing the bloodvessels, increasing the blood-pressure, and overtaxing 
the heart. On the other hand, it has been urged that an insufficient 
consumption of fluids tends to reduce the blood- pressure too much, 
and thereby retards the excretion of the waste products of the body. 
In the treatment of cardiac diseases, especially senile heart, fatty 
heart, beer-drinker's heart, and other conditions in which there is 
a loss of muscular tone and vigour, resulting in abdominal plethora, 
ascites, anasarca, with tumidity of the liver or gastro-intestinal 
catarrh from passive congestion, Oertel, Von Noorden, Balfour, and 
others, aim at a reduction of the fluids in the bodily tissues by 
limiting the consumption of liquids to 15 ounces daily. At the 
same time they limit the consumption of carbohydrates on the 
ground that they supply material which readily undergoes fermenta- 
tion, leading to the production of injurious fatty acids and gases 
which disturb the action of the heart, and slightly increase the 
proteins. 

The diet may be exemplified as follows: Eggs, fish, fresh meat, 
poultry, tripe, and sweetbread form the basis of the food; dry toast, 
biscuits (crackers), and zwiebach are the chief sources of carbo- 
hydrate, which must be taken in small quantity; a tablespoonful 
of mashed potato or spinach is permitted, and a small amount of 
milk pudding, cooked apples, pears, prunes, plums, or an equiva- 
lent amount of ripe strawberries, raspberries, bananas, or tomatoes. 
The diet should be spare and the calorie xalue about 1,700 to 2,000 
calories. The liquid should only amount to | pint daily, consisting 
of a teacupful of tea, coffee, or cocoa, with sugar and cream, at 
breakfast and teatime, and a wineglassful of good wine at dinner- 
time, made up with water to 5 ounces, or 4 or 5 ounces of plain 
water with A ounce of good whisky or brandy in the evening. The 
meals should be four and a half or five hours apart, and the heaviest 
meal should be taken at midday; no food should be taken with the 
afternoon cup of tea. and the last meal should be eaten at about 
7 p.m. 



238 SPECIAL DIETS 

There is no doubt whatever alM)ut tlie iulvantage to be derived 
from a reduction of the consumption of hquids in many cases; but 
the strict hmitation of hquids to J pint daily is not beneficial in all 
cases, and, indeed, it may prove harmful by causing an accumula- 
tion in the tissues of the products of metabolism, irritating the 
kidneys by concentration of the urine; increasing resistance to the 
circulation by inducing a contraction of the small bloodvessels, 
whose lumen is probably already reduced in parts by art erio -fibrosis, 
whereby the already weakened heart is o\ertaxed. 

The " dry diet cure," says Albu^ is as old as the Greeks, but was 
revived by Schroth in his so-called Scmindkur. This consists of 
the consumption of five or six dry rolls in the course of a day, while 
liquids are entirely abstained from for a period of five or six days; 
after this time he allowed the patient to take some kind of porridge 
in the middle of the day, and a small amount of wine. Jiirgenson 
found Schroth's diet useful in the treatment of pleural and peritoneal 
effusions, and likewise in hydrops articuli and old syphilitic joint 
troubles, but observed that abstinence from fluids caused great 
distress. Swieten found a dry diet useful in the treatment of 
dilated stomachs; it also meets the approval of Albu and Riegel for 
this disea5e, as well as for renal and cardiac drops}'. 

Overfeeding Cures. — Overfeeding consists of the consumption of 
food ha\ing a liigher protein and calorie value than that required 
for the physiological and dynamical necessities of the organism. 
In the case of adults, overfeeding is employed especially in the 
treatment of tuberculosis, certain forms of ancxmia and chlorosis, 
neurasthenia, hysteria, visceroptosis, malnutrition generally, and 
convalescence from various diseases. Its employment is possible 
owing to the fact that the assimilation of excessive quantities of 
food may go on in spite of diminished functional (motor) power of the 
alimentary canal. The originators were Weir Mitchell and Playfair. 
In neurasthenic cases \\t\r ]\Iitchell also insisted upon isolaticn of 
the patient; she should be removed entirely from her friends, and 
visited only by her doctor and nurse until a considerable improve- 
ment is made. The receipt or sending of letters, and other modes 
of communicating with the outside world are forbidden. She 
should be kept in bed for four to six weeks, fed abundantly, and 
massaged daily to overcome the evils of rest and high feeding. 

During the first week of treatment the diet consists entirely of milk, 
which is given in doses of 2 to 10 ounces every two hours, day and 
night. The amount is gradually increased from 2 pints on the first 
day to 4 or 5 pints on the eighth. In the second week a further 
advance is made. About the ninth or tenth day a boiled egg, fried 
sole, or mutton chop, is given with some bread-and-butter, the 
amount of milk remaining the same. The next day a plateful of 
soup is given in place of one glassful of milk. And on the following 
da}' a chop or fish is accompanied by a spoonful of potato or vege- 
table. The amount of solid food is steadily increased, and by the

sixtccntli day slio sliould be able to take three full meals daily, 
inchuliu!^^ meat, fish, or egg and bacon for breakfast; and soup, 
ftsh, meat, or game, with potatoes, vegetables, and dessert, for dinner 
and supper, in addition to 4 pints of milk. The consumption of 
food by many neurasthenics lias to bo carefully watched; the nurse 
must be alert, for the patient who desires to avoid eating her 
food may resort to peculiar methods of disposing of it. A consider- 
able amount of firmness combinetl with kindness must be used. The 
patient is only allowed to get out of bed to urinate or defa-cate. 
Massage is usually begun about the fourth da\' of treatment, being 
performed at first for half an hour daily, but gradually increased to 
two or more hours, and continued up to the end of the treatment. 
The patient usually increases in size and weight, and when properly 
carried out, the cure is complete and permanent. Weir Mitchell 
says: " I have watched again and again, with growing surprise, 
some listless, feeble, white-blood creatures, learning by degrees to 
eat these large rations, and, under their use, gathering flesh, colour, 
and wholesomeness of mind and body." 

It is not necessary to slavishly follow Weir Mitchell's plans. The 
object to be aimed at is the administration of a large amount of 
highly nutritious food in a relativeh' small volume; the intervals 
of feeding should be short, and the total amount of food consumed 
should have a heat value of 3,000 to 3,500, and, in special cases, 
4,000 calories. Milk is not the only food necessary, and the mere 
bulk is too much for many people. A pint of milk of average 
quality \ields 410 calories and contains 21 grammes of protein; so 
that 5 pints would contain 105 grammes of protein and 2,050 calories. 
The amount of protein should not be less than that, and the calories 
should be more. But it is practically impossible to give more milk. 
Casein and dried-milk powders can be used, also eggs, meat, fish, 
fowl, cream, butter, cream cheese, and other rich foods. The value 
of a milk diet consists of its blandness; it diminishes putrefaction in 
the alimentary canal, which increases its value when the case is 
complicated by diseases of the gastro-intestinal system, heart, or 
kidneys. Kephir and milk soured by cultures of the Bulgarian bacillus 
can be used, as they ha\'e the same nutritive value as milk, besides 
possessing properties calculated to diminish auto-intoxication, 
which many authorities consider to be the cause of neurasthenia. 

If the case is complicated by gastric ulcer, overfeeding may at 
first be impossible; but functional diseases of the stomach are often 
benefited by a methodical increase in the amount of food consumed. 
The diet must be varied according to the secretory and motor powers 
of the stomach, and, for a good result to be obtained, Kuttner holds 
that it is necessary to estimate the tolerance of the organism for 
carbohydrates and fat respectively. The amount of protein should 
be modified by the age, habits, and calling of the patient. It should 
be gradually increased from the physiological minimum necessary 
to maintain equilibrium to a maximum. Xaunyn puts the maxi- 
mum quantity of ])roteins beneficial to diabetics at 120 grammes 



240 



SPECIAL DIETS 



daily. This may be adopted as a standard to aim at. It would be 
contained in 6 pints of milk. 

Kuttner^ holds that the systematic use of Weir Mitchell treatment 
in its customary form is not indicated for neurasthenics and many 
other cases for whom overfeeding is considered desirable; that for 
most cases muscular activity is urgently needed for protein digestion 
and for strengthening the heart-muscle. Albu found that with 
Weir Mitchell treatment the patient gains an average of 15 pounds 
during the first four weeks of treatment, and afterwards a slower 
gain, making a total increase of 25 to 30 poimds weight. The most 
important end of the cure, however, is not the formation of fatt}' 
tissue, but the replacing of lost tissue proteins, the strengthening 
of muscle, the rehabiliment of the nervous system, the recovery of 
tone, and improvement of the condition of the blood. 

In sanatoria for consumptives it is possible to give an excessive 
quantity of food while the patient is not only allowed freedom of 
movement, but actually required to do some out-of-door work, such 
as gardening or other light occupation. The following diets by 
Dr. S. V. Pearson- are given as examples of the dietary in Mundesley

The danger of carrying the treatment by overfeeding too far is a 
real one. The longer the overfeeding lasts, the smaller becomes the 
increase of tissue protein week by week, and the greater the addition 
of fat. In consumption the immoderate overfeeding may lead to 
serious cardiac debility, in addition to the minor evils arising from 



Med. Klin., May 9, 1909.

UNDIirU-liEDING CURES 241 

the accumulation of fat, the lessened capacity for work, and 
diminished resistance. The condition of the excretory organs also 
require consideration as well as that of the circulatory system. 

In cases of anaemia and chlorosis an overfeeding cure may be very 
beneficial, but only where the nutrition was previously bad and the 
cause of the faulty nutrition can be ascertained. If Weir Mitchell 
treatment cannot be obtained, or sufficient rest cannot be had, 
and overfeeding with ordinary- mixed food does not cause an increase 
of weight, a good method is to increase the consumption of fat, 
while the protein is kept at about 100 grammes daily. Butter, 
cream cheese, fat ham, or bacon, are substances which can usually 
be taken in large amount with bread, potatoes, vegetables, and 
puddings. 3Iilk diet is not suited for chlorosis. It is deficient in iron. 
But it may be taken to the extent of a pint a day. The best sources 
of protein are underdone meat, game, poultry, and raw-meat juice. 

Underfeeding. — Neither men nor animals possess any sure in- 
stinct to guide them as to the quantity or quality of food they 
should eat. Civilization has placed at man's disposal very large 
quantities of food. The development of the art of cooking, con- 
currently with the improvement of our foodstuffs, has led to the 
preparation of the food in such a manner as to spare his digestive 
organs much of the work which devolved upon them in the pre- 
civilized state. The prevalence of excessive eating and the results 
which follow it are largely due to the art of cooking. Cooked food 
is more pleasant to the taste. B3' it the appetite is stimulated, 
and the habit of eating more than is necessary is readily acquired. 
Fonssagrives said: " Each meal may be divided into three parts — 
the first for necessity, the second for gluttony, and the third for 
disease to come." This dictum is an exaggeration when applied 
to the majority of people. But an immense number of people eat 
a good deal more food than is necessary, and the excess is a common 
cause of numerous ailments. Our forefathers submitted to periodi- 
cal bleedings, which had the effect of relieving them from the con- 
sequences of superalimentation. Since the rejection of this mode 
of treatment, various others have come into vogue, such as the 
" cure " by aperient waters, baths, and lastly by a course of under- 
feeding. As a cure for obesity, underfeeding was first systemati- 
cally employed by Brillat-Savarin, and later on by Banting, Karell, 
Oertel, Ebstein, \'on Xoorden, and a long line of physicians. All 
these authorities gave dietaries which yielded somewhat less than 
half the energy-producing value of the normal food, and nearly all 
of them considered that meat and other nitrogenous foods should 
form the basis of the dietary. It should, however, be stated at 
once that a too sudden reduction of the calorie value of the food 
may cause a loss of power or resistance to disease, or diffuse inflam- 
mation of the kidneys. It should be remembered that the energy 
expended in the performance of the physiological functions is never 
less than 1,400 calories, and with a person lying in bed the daily 
expenditure is usuallv about i,6co calories. One has to consider 

16 



242 SPECIAL DIETS 

how far it is sate to drop tlic allowance below that which is required 
for the physiological work of the organism apart from physical 
labour. Banting's diet provides only about 1,150, Oertel's 1,200 to 
1,600, Hbstein's 1,300, \'on Noorden's 1,350, and Karell's milk 
1,200 to 1,600 calories. It matters very little whether fat or 
larbohydrate be reduced the most, but both should be reduced. 
The consideration of protein is far more important. Banting's 
diet was practically all meat, and contained about 180 grammes of 
protein. Salisbury's meat diet contains about 220 grammes, 
riiese amounts are considered far too much by many authorities. 
The popular notion that a diet of lean meat " eats up the fat " 
which has accuinulated in the body is due to the food usually being 
of low calorie value or deficient in carbon. Oertel reduced the 
amount of protein to 160 grammes, but he allowed 25 to 45 grammes 
of fat and 75 to 120 grammes of carbohydrate. Ebstein reduced 
the protein to 100 grammes, the carbohydrate to 50 grammes, and 
raised the fat from 60 to 100 grammes. Albu considers it is im- 
possible to consume 100 grammes of fat with such a limited amount 
of carbohydrate, and that 100 grammes of protein is too little when 
the heat value of the food is below 1,500 calories, and recommends 
that the protein should be not less than 120 grammes daily. Von 
Xoorden recommends protein 150, fat 30, carbohydrate 100 grammes; 
calories about 1,350. Kuttner^ considers the suitability of various 
other cases for treatment by underfeeding. Some of these have 
already been mentioned under the head of Milk Cures. The whey 
cure is another system of underfeeding. Cases of myocarditis, with 
a basis of arterio-sclerosis, are often benefited by the limitation of 
food and drink, but heart disease accompanied by parenchymatous 
nephritis and a weak pulse is not suitable for treatment by under- 
feeding. " Of kidney chsease.s," Kuttner considers, " the condition 
of contracted kidney specially indicates treatment by underfeeding 
and limitation of fluids; but injury is often done by treating all 
cases of albuminuria on these lines, especially cases of orthostatic 
albuminuria in childhood." Neither should the food be reduced 
in cases of slight atony of the stomach and bowels, visceroptosis, and 
in general debilit}', where the gastric disturbances are only functional. 
The Tufnell and Bellingham diets are combinations of the " dry 
diet " and underfeeding used in the treatment of aneurism. It was 
first prescribed in 1852 by Belhngham, and again in 1875 by Tuf- 
nell. \'alsalva kept his patients in bed for forty-two days at a 
tin.e, and bled them frequently. Tufnell kept them in bed for 
sixty to one hundred days without bleeding, but with a diet con- 
sisting of 10 ounces of solid food and 8 ounces of liquids daily, the 
object being to reduce the force and frequency of the heart, and 
thereby favour the deposition of fibrin in the sac of a sacculated 
aneurism. Bellingham and Tufnell permitted three meals a day, 
each consisting of 2 ounces of liquid and 2 ounces of solid food, 
with 3 ounces of cooked meat and a little potato in the middle of 

1 Klin. Med., May 9, 1909. 



UNDEIiFEEDING CURES 24^ 

the day. It is not a very satisfactory inethod of treatment, and 
is falling into disuse. A diet of low energy value — say, 1,200 
calories — consisting of bread, meat, potato, .and butter, would do 
as well and cause less trouble and anxiety to the patient and atten- 
dants. 

In all cases where a diet of extremely low value is adopted the 
object of the treatment should be fully explained to the patient, 
and he should have sulficient strength of will to put up with the 
discomfort for six weeks. That people can bear absolute starva- 
tion for four or six weeks has been shown over and over again, but 
patients who have any disease of the cardiac valves should not be 
submitted to treatment with food of such low value. Something 
can be done to diminish the distress of patients by letting them lie 
upon a water-bed, while the dryness of the mouth is checked by 
painting the tongue with glycerine, sponging it with borax-water, 
ice-water, or boracic lotion. The heart and aneurism must be 
watched. If the pulse becomes very frequent, the tongue very 
dry and brown, and the patient very restless, some modification 
should be made in the diet, and the first addition should consist of 
water or milk and water. 

There are other systems of underfeeding, consisting for the most 
part of fads followed by nmiierous votaries. 

The " low protein diet " of Chittenden has been referred to on 
several occasions, and especially when considering the amount of 
protein required by the body. Vegetarian and fruitarian dietaries 
have usually a low protein \alue. One of the most able exponents 
of the vegetarian system in England is Mr. Eustace Miles, whose 
success as an athlete is advanced as a proof that strength and 
endurance can be obtained from a vegetarian diet as readily as 
from the ordinary mixed diet. Miles, however, is not a strict 
vegetarian, but a lacto- vegetarian. Food consumed and recom- 
mended by him consists of milk, cream, butter, eggs, cheese, 
casein preparations, with cereals, legumes, vegetables, fruits, nuts, 
sugar, salt, and other condiments. He lays stress upon eating 
leisurely, condemns hurry under any circumstances, and lays down 
rules for daily physical exercises and for the cultivation of the mind 
as well as the body. He preaches " the gospel of fitness," but it 
seems almost impossible for any but the wealthy and leisured classes 
to follow his teachings thoroughly. 

A change of diet in the direction urged by vegetarians would 
have great economical advantages, because vegetable proteins are 
less costly than those of animal origin. But one should always 
bear in mind the fact that there is a physiological minimum for the 
necessity of protein, that growing children need proportionately 
more than adults, and that it is probable that the majority of 
people are stronger and better in health when they consume a 
moderate amount of meat, game, fish, and other animal foods. 
A moderate amount is greater than the ph\sio logical niinimum, and 
may be fixed at i gramme of protein per kilo of body- weight for

ordinary persons, more being allowed during the period of growth 
and during special occasions, such as pregnancy and lactation. 

T/ic No-Brcakfasi Finn and tJw Fastinq Cure — The Frenchman 
as a rule takes little food before midday, but contents himself with 
a cupful of chocolate and a roll. This allowance is very small for 
the first meal of the day, when compared with the egg-and-bacon, 
fish, or meat, consumed by the average iuiglishman at an early 
hour of the morning. But even the Englishman's breakfast is con- 
sidered meagre in the United States and Canada, where the meal 
almost universally consists of meat, cereals, fruit, and other foods. 
It is possible that there are many people who would be better in 
health if the}* had no breakfast, but as a general rule it would be 
better for such people to cat somewhat less at each of the meals 
than to miss an important meal altogether. The no-breakfast plan 
is not an ideal institution, especially for the inhabitants of cold, 
northerly climates. The bod}^ must use some material for the pro- 
duction of heat and energy, and abstinence from food until the 
middle of the day tends to use up too completely the stores of 
protein and gl3'cogen, as well as a little fat. There is a small per- 
centage of persons who from habit and disposition eat no more 
breakfast than the roll and chocolate of the Frenchman; but if a 
number of such persons were canvassed, it would be found that, as 
a general rule, their health is poor in comparison with that of the 
breakfast-eater. 

The apostle of the fasting cure was the late Dr. E. H.Dewey, of 
America,^ who recommended fasting as a remedy for many diseases 
and conducted fasts of four to eight weeks' duration. There is no 
doubt w^hatever that short fasts of a few days to a week may be 
beneficial to many people. Such fasts have been practised from 
the remotest antiquity. A generation ago Keith, of Edinburgh, 
treated many of his patients by short fasts, allowing only hot water 
to drink. Such fasts, however, are very moderate compared with 
those prescribed by Dewey, who at first recommended the no- 
breakfast plan, on the supposition that people ate a good deal more 
than was good for them, and that their troubles could be relieved 
by abstinence. Later on, Hereward Carrington,^ a disciple of 
Dewey's, published a " physiological study of the curative power 
of fasting," in which he attempts to assail the fundamental prin- 
ciple of dietetics, that the food of the body is the source of the heat 
and energy exhibited by it. We cannot occupy space in replying 
to the assertion that food is not a source of heat or energy. We 
can only agree that moderate fasts are beneficial, and that it is 
advisable that all such fasts should be carried out under medical 
supervision, and that in a large number of cases a modification of 
the diet, such as by only taking whey, buttermilk, or a pint or 
two of milk daily, will give as much benefit as absolute fasting. 

Fletcherism.( — If the no-breakfast plan or the fasting cure are

FLETCHER ISM 245 

admitted to be beneficial to some people, the same may be said of 
the method of treatment recommended by Mr. Horace Fletcher. 
Dewey's crusade was a!:,'ainst overfeeding; Fletcher protests against 
insufficient mastication. Both men have a scientific basis for their 
methods, both have carried their principles to an irrational extreme. 
Fletcher, however, does not go to the same extreme as Carrington. 
His system is to chew each mouthful of food until it is reduced to 
a fluid, to swallow only the liquid, and to remove the solid residue 
from the mouth with the fingers. The system is not exactly new. 
Something of the kind was taught in ancient times by Epimenides 
of Crete. Fletcher claims that when his system is adopted, a rela- 
tively small amount of food appeases the appetite, in consequence 
of which there is a loss of body- weight, but the general health and 
activity are improved, and all digest i\-e troubles cease. Fletcher, 
while an athlete of considerable eminence at Yale University, main- 
tained his body in perfect health and fitness on a diet containing 
only 60 grammes of protein and 1,600 calories. These figures are 
low, but it has been shown again and again that the nitrogenous 
equilibrium can be maintained upon this amount of protein. Chit- 
tenden personally investigated his metabolism, as well as that of 
other athletes, and proved that they could maintain mental and 
physical vigour upon a daily output of nitrogen representing the 
metabolism of 55 grammes of protein, or about half the amount 
usually recommended in standard dietaries. There is no doubt, as 
stated elsewhere, that the consumption of animal foods usually 
exceeds the actual reqviirement. The investigation has done much 
towards breaking down the standards, but Fletcherism cannot be 
accepted in its entirety. It is admitted that mastication is sadly 
neglected by a vast number of people, that food is bolted, and 
additional work thrown upon the digestive organs to digest and 
assimilate it ; but surely it is not only unnecessary, but inadvisable, 
to remove the residue of the masticated food from the mouth. 
Fletcher argues that it prevents a large amount of waste material 
reaching the intestines, where it exercises an injurious effect. It 
has, however, never been shown that the presence of food in the 
intestines is injurious, or that there is any ad^•antage in the presence 
of a small amount of faces. In the majority of cases the reverse 
obtains. With regard to the small calorie value of Fletcher's mode 
of feeding, it must be asserted that 1,600 calories does not represent 
the amount of energy expended by the body while doing ordinary 
work, and that the average individual expends from 2,000 to 3,000 
calories or more according to the amount and kind of work done. 
As a system of underfeeding, Fletcherism is of undoubted value for 
many cases previously detailed. The inculcation of careful and 
prolonged mastication by dyspeptics and many other persons is a 
point which the physician has ever to bear in mind ; but it would 
be a delusion to imagine that mastication, however carefully it 
may be performed, can increase the value of the proteins, fats, or 
carbohydrates, which comprise the nutriment in the food consumed. 



CHAPTER VIII 

STIMULANTS 

Inasmuch as stimulants form an important part of the beverages 
used by mankind, some account of tlieir value and effects on 
metabolism is requisite. The chemical side of these substances 
has been fully dealt with in the companion volume on " Foods: 
their Origin, Manufacture, and Composition"* The reader is 
referred to it for further information. 

Alcohol in Health and Disease. 

Every alcoholic beverage is a combination of alcohols, ethers, 
acids, aldehydes, sugars, and salts. The chief of these is ethyl 
alcohol {C.^iieO). It arises from the hydrolytic cleavage of sugar 
in fermentation, lOO parts of sugar being transformed into 105-26 
parts of dextrose, which yields alcohol, 51-11 parts; carbon dioxide, 
49-31 parts; succinic acid, 0-67 part; glycerine, 3-17 parts; and 
materials combined with the ferment, i-oo part. The amount 
of ethjd alcohol in different beverages is as follows:

Fusel Oil. — Besides ethyl alcohol, any other of the primary 
alcohols may be present. Wine and spirits contain propyl, butyl, 
amyl, hexyl, and hcptyl, alcohols; besides small quantities of 
secondary alcohols. All these bodies are usually classed together 
as higher alcohols, or " fusel oil." According to Ehrlich,^ they 
arise from the destruction of proteins; but they arise in spirits

after distillation, and as they contain no protein, another origin 
must be sought. 

Acids. — Fermented liquors contain many acids. In malt liquors 
there are lactic, malic, acetic, valeric, tannic, and gallic acids. In 
wines the free acids are acetic, citric, tartaric, malic, malonic, 
saccharic, caproic, suberic, and others; and the combined acids are 
tartrates, acetates, citrates, racematcs, butyi^ates, propionates, etc. 

Ethers. — These are formed by the interaction of alcohols and 
acids, and contribute to the flavour of the beverage. The bouquet 
of wines, called (vnanihyl ether, is a combination of acetic, oenanthic, 
capric, and caprylic ethers. Rum contains ethers resulting from 
the action of acetic, saccharic, and suberic acids upon alcohol, 
the chief result being ethyl suberate. Brandy contains acetic, 
oenanthic, propionic, butyric, and caproic ethers. Beer contain s 
traces of amylic, acetic, valeric, and caproic ethers. 

The Heat Value o£ Alcohol. — The heat resulting from the combus- 
tion of alcohol is 7-067 calories per granmie. It is isodynamically 
equivalent to 17 grammes of carbohydrate. But as a source of 
heat to the body it is inferior to the sugar from which it is derived; 
100 grammes of sugar yield 410 calories, but only yield 51 grammes 
of alcohol, having an energy value of 360 calories. 

The Food Value of Alcohol. — It was formerly considered that no 
alcohol was used in the body, and that the nutritive properties of 
wine or beer were derived from sugar, proteins, and extractives. 
It is now known that some alcohol is actually utilized, and that it 
yields heat in the same way as other foods. This is proved by the fact 
that when moderate quantities of alcohol are consumed, only i -5 or 
2-0 percent, is eliminated unchanged by the skin, lungs, and kidneys. 

The amount of alcohol which the body can oxidize is limited. 

Parkes and Wollowicz^ considered not more than 2 ounces 
(57 c.c.) per diem was completely oxidized. With this quantity 
only I to 3 per cent, escaped unchanged; with a larger dose 10 per 
cent, escaped combustion, some portion being eliminated as acetalde- 
hyde, acetic ether, and acetic acid, and some alcohol remained in the 
tissues. Atwater and Benedict^ found that when 72*5 grammes of 
alcohol (equivalent to $\ ounces of whisky) was consumed, only 
2-9 per cent, escaped unchanged, and there was little evidence of the 
excretion of partially oxidized products. The amount which any 
person can oxidize appears to be a matter of idiosyncrasy and 
habit. It is not uncommon for topers to consume a bottle of spirits 
(35 ounces) a day; and there is no record of the amount of unoxidized 
alcohol or its by-products eliminated by such persons. The 
constant presence of partially oxidized alcohol in the expired air of 
such persons is discovered by the odour of their breath. But it 
does not follow that the oxidized alcohol is a source of energy. To 
prove that it is a food, Bunge^ says: " We do not know whether

alcohol is a source ot encrf,'y ; and it is necessary to show that the energy 
liberated by the oxidation of alcohol is used in the performance of 
normal function. It is not enough to show that potential energy 
is transformed into kinetic energy. The transformation must occur 
at the right time and in the right place." It may be asserted that 
the heat derived from the combustion of alcohol must economize 
the use of other foods. This is questionable. The paralyzing 
effect of alcohol on the vasomotor system causes dilatation of the 
cutaneous vessels and increased loss of heat, the result being a 
reduction of the temperature of the body. The idea that alcohol 
warms the body in cold weathcM" is due in the first place to flushing 
the skin with blood, and in the second to the narcotic effect on the 
central nervous system. It lowers the temperature of the body. 
In Ross's Antarctic expedition spirits were found deleterious to 
the men ; they were colder and more fatigued after a dose than before 
it, and the drinkers were more liable to scurvy than the abstainers. 
The Hudson Baj^ Company also found alcohol lessens the power 
of the men to bear cold, and have excluded it from their provisions. 
There are plenty of cases recorded of people living for weeks together 
on alcoholic beverages and nothing else. Publicans have instanced 
persons who drank 20 pints of beer a day. This quantity, assuming 
it to be oT average quality, wouT3 contain 568 grammes (more 
than 18 ounces) of alcohol, 600 grammes of carbohydrate, 33 grammes 
of protein, and on combustion would yield 6,800 calories. This 
supply of energy is enormous, and if utilized, would be enough for 
two men doing a moderate day's work. But a diet consisting wholly 
of beer would be deficient in protein. Bin;? found that alcohol 
reduces the excretion of nitrogen, and is a protein sparer. Scientific 
opinion is not unanimous on this point. Parkcs and others, who 
made careful observations, failed to notice any reduction in nitrogen 
excretion. Miura^ fed himself on carbohydrates and fat until the 
nitrogen excretion was at an equilibrium. He then replaced part 
of the carbohydrate with an isodynamic quantity of alcohol, and 
his nitrogen excretion was increased. Hence he concluded alcohol 
did not spare the tissues. In larger doses it increased the output 
of nitrogen. In this respect it resembles arsenic and phosphorus, 
which cause a breakdown of the protein-molecule, the nitrogenous 
portion being excreted, and the fatty moiety oxidized or stored as 
fat.^ This explains the accumulation of fat in those who drink 
much beer. Hutchison says alcohol paralyzes the cells so that they 
are unable to break down fatty compounds. It is a fat-sparer; 
to a less extent it spares carbohydrate ; but it is doubtful if it inter- 
feres with the power of dealing with protein. He says alcohol 
" is consumed and yields energy, and therefore is entitled to rank 
as a food. . . It does not follow it is as good a source of heat as 
fat, quite the contrary; it causes more heat to be lost than it pro-

ALCOHOL A\D WORK 249 

duces. Still less reason is tlierc to suppose it is a useful muscle 
food."^ 

Alcohol does fiot give Strength. — The idea that alcohol increases 
the power of endurance, gives greater energy and ability to work 
longer, pervades the public mind. The experience of many who take 
a glass or two of beer daily is that they can continue to work longer 
than when they do not take it. Scientific observations do not 
support this opinion. Alcohol is a. poison, to protoplasm and 
depresses cellular activity. All solutions of alcohol affect unicellular 
organisms in proportion to the quantity: i to 5 per cent, paralyzes 
them ; 6 per cent, produces inunediatc arrest of all motion. Growth 
is checked in torula, eggs of earthworms, ascarides, tapeworms, 
leeches; hydra, leeches, earthworms, snails, tadpoles, crayfish, and 
other fishes are killed by it. Muscular contraction is weakened in 
proportion to the amount of alcohol. This can be proved in the 
frog and other small animals by direct experiments. Experiments 
on men show that the muscular work performed under its influence 
is less than without it. Accurate measurements have been made. 
Rivers ^ found by the ergograph that 5 to 20 c.c. of alcohol had no 
effect on the quantity or quality of work done; with 40 c.c. the 
evidence was uncertain; but 80 c.c. caused a decided falling off 
in the amount of work done. Alcohol deadens the sense of fatigue 
by paralyzing the nerve centres, it allj^'s discomfort, produces a 
feelin^of light-he_artedness, and enables the workman to endure a 
greater strain or work longer than without it. But muscular wotk 
is not-better done under its influence, nor is the endurance increased 
b£yond-ar short period. Scheffer found alcohol first increases and 
then diminisiies muscular pawner. If the peripheral motor nerve 
apparatus is first eliminated by curare, the alcohol has no stimu- 
lating effect. 

The experience of military commanders and other governors of 
large bodies of men of every description, in all climates, and in every 
viscissitude of temperature, shows that men are better able to 
perform arduous duties, endure prolonged exertion and exhausting 
marches, when no alcohol is allowed as part of their daily food. 
They can bear hunger and fatigue, heat and cold, snow or rain, 
better without it. General Grenfell says: "The Egj^ptian cam- 
paign was a teetotal campaign. I took over the rear-guard at the 
finish, and I have never seen a force of men so fit and so well as 
that force." Kitchener allowed his men no alcohol in the Soudan 
campaign, and encouraged them to drink cold tea when on long 
marches. In the South African War the Boer leaders prohibited 
the use of alcohol, but the British soldiers were not abstainers. 
Sir F. Treves, who was with the Ladysmith column says: "The 
first men who dropped out of that army of 30,000 were not the tall 
men, or the short men. or the big men; they were the drinkers, and 
they dropped out as clearly as if they had been labelled with a big

letter on their backs." Industrial leaders give the same experience. 
In one year at Uxbridgc 23.000,000 bricks were made. The average 
number made by beer-drinkers was 760,269, and by teetotallers 
795.400, or 35,131 in favour of the latter. The highest number 
made by a beer-drinker was 880,000, and by a teetotaller 890,000, 
leaNnng 10,000 in favour of the teetotaller. The lowest number 
made by a beer-drinker was 659,000, and by a teetotaller 746,000, 
or 87,000 in favour of the teetotaller. At another place the printers 
were compared, and it was found that the number of letters com- 
posed per diem was less when alcohol was taken, the average 
diminution being 15-2 per cent. Its effect on mental work has 
been referred to in a previous section, where it was shown that 
memory, attention, and the association of ideas were adversely 
affected by alcohol. But this is largely a matter of idiosyncrasy, 
some people being affected more than others. There is evidence 
to show that the best mental work is performed without it. There 
is usually a stage when the cerebral activity is slightly increased 
and its faculties sharpened; but this is followed by a period of con- 
stantly diminishing power, when thought is slower and a longer time 
is required to perform a known quantity of mental work, and the 
results are less certain. 

Effects of Alcohol on Digestion. — Alcohol is primarily an appetizer. 
It sharpens the palate, increases the desire for, and enjoyment of, 
food, and to that extent is beneficial. Convalescent, debilitated, 
and aged persons frequently eat more food when it is accompanied 
by a glass of beer, wine, or diluted spirits. The value of such a 
beverage to those who need stimulation, and especially to those 
whose occupation is sedentary, is admitted by most scientific men. 
But when they investigate the influence of alcohol on digestion, 
their results are not in favour of it. Digestion is not better per- 
formed when alcohol is present, nor does appetite return so soon. 
Kretschj^^ made observations on a person having a gastric fistula; 
Buchner^ on a healthy person by the aid of a stomach-pump. 
Both found digestion hindered by the presence of alcohol. Blumen- 
eau,^ following the example of Buchner, found that during the first 
three hours alcohol hinders digestion by causing lactic acid to be 
secreted in place of hydrochloric acid; a large quantity of alcohol 
hindered more than a small one ; the motor activity and absorptive 
power of the stomach were hindered in proportion to the quantity 
of alcohol; but the secretion of gastric juice was prolonged; during 
the fifth and sixth hours after the meal hydrochloric acid is rapidly 
secreted, and digestion quickly completed. 

Experiments in artificial digestion are numerous. But it must 
be borne in mind that the conditions are different. The propor- 
tion of pepsin and hydrochloric acid can be regulated by prior 
preparation. Both acid and ferment arc there from the moment

Ar.ro HOT. AND DIGESTION 251 

the food is put in tlic mixture. Heariuf,' tlusc points in mind, the 
results obtained by Chittenden and McndeP are interesting. It 
was found absolute alcohol in the proportion of i to 3 per cent. 
5/rm«/a/t'(/ digestion by a fraction of i percent., 2 to 3 per cent. 
checked digestion, and 3 per cent, reduced digestion 17-6 per cent. 
Pure rye whisky diluted to contain the same proportion of alcohol 
gave the same results, excepting when the whisky mixture contained 
from I to 3 per cent., in which case digestion was increased from 
3 to 5 per cent. Brandy, rum, and gin gave corresponding results. 
As the result of these observations, Chittenden and Mendel expressed 
the opinion that " whisky only impedes the solvent action of gastric 
juice when it is consumed in immoderate and intoxicating quan- 
tities." Of course, this remark applies to gastric juice containing 
the normal proportion of pepsin and hydrochloric acid, such as 
would be made in vitro. But in the human stomach lactic acid 
replaces hydrochloric acid under the influence of alcohol, and the 
digestive power of pepsin in the presence of lactic acid is compara- 
tively small. Sir William Roberts made numerous experiments 
in artificial digestion, the mixture consisting of 2 grammes of dried 
beef digested in 0-15 c.c. of hydrochloric acid, i c.c. glycerine extract 
of pepsin, a varying quantity of alcohol, and water to make 100 c.c. 
The results obtained were as follows ■} The mixture without alcohol 
was entirely digested in one hundred minutes. When spirits were 
added, 5 per cent, of proof spirit — whisky, brandy, or gin — did not 
affect the time required for digestion; 10 per cent, prolonged the 
time to 115, 20 per cent, to 135, 30 per cent, to 180 minutes, and 
when 40 per cent, w as added, the digestion was embarrassed and 
peptonization scarcely occurred. Port wine had the same effect 
up to 10 per cent. ; but above this proportion it had a slightly greater 
inhibitory effect than spirits ; 20 per cent, prolonged the digestion 
to 180 minutes, 30 per cent, to 200 minutes, and with 40 per cent. 
there was scarcely any peptonization. Sherry had a greater in- 
hibitory power than port: the presence of 20 per cent, of sherry — 
i.e., about 4 per cent, of alcohol — trebled the time required for 
digestion, and 30 per cent, of sherry almost entirely inhibited diges- 
tion. These figures are important, as \ pii^t of wine is commonly 
consumed; but this amount in a total gastric charge of 2 pounds 
would amount to 25 per cent., and would seriously embarrass 
digestion until the wine is absorbed. It is remarkable that both 
wines have a greater inhibitory effect than any spirit, which Roberts 
says indicates " there must be in these wines some retarding agent 
besides alcohol." Malt liquors contain 4 to 6 per cent, of alcohol, 
but the inhibition of digestion due to such liquids is out of all pro- 
portion to the alcohol contained. Thus Roberts found 10 per cent, 
of Burton ale prolonged the digestion of the above mi.xture to 
115, 20 per cent, to 140, and 40 per cent, to 200, minutes; 40 per 
cent, of lager beer or table beer prolonged the time to 140, and

Go per cent, to i8o, minutes. These beverages are frequently con- 
sumed with meals, and form 50, 60, or even 80, per cent, of the 
contents of the stomach during digestion. 

The effects of alcohol on starch digestion vary according to the 
form in which it is consumed. It stimulates the nerves of the mouth 
and causes a profuse secretion of saliva. To this extent it promotes 
digestion. But artificial digestion experiments show that it checks 
the action of ptyalin, and thereby retards the digestion of starch. 
This effect is not \'en' marked when ordinary doses of spirits are 
consumed ; even 40 per cent, did not entirely stop it. But Roberts 
found " 50, 60, or 80, per cent, of malt liquor in the digesting 
stomach, common proportions, acted as a powerful retardant, 
especially' on the digestion of bread and other farinaceous foods." 

As regards its influence on the motor power of the stomach, the 
investigations are in favour of the moderate use of alcohol. Binz 
found the muscular activit}' stimulated to a certain extent by 
alcohol, and others have found the same. But this conclusion is 
not accepted b}' all men. There are some who assert that the 
primary increase of motor acti^^t^' is due to a local irritant effect, 
and is followed by a secondary decrease of motor activity due to 
nervous depression, as the result of which the gastric movements 
are slow and languid. Binz found olive-oil discharged from the 
stomach more rapidly when alcohol was used than when it was 
not used. But test meals, with and without alcohol, show that 
there is a delay in the passage of food from the stomach after taking 
alcohol. Penzoldt and Wolffhardt found 30 to 40 grammes (i to 
i^ ounces) of brandy taken before or during a meal shortened the 
time of gastric digestion by half an hour; and red wines had a pro- 
portionate effect; but this is contrary to the experience of other 
men. Hutchison ^ considei-s the moderate use of alcohol in health 
and disease is beneficial through its influence on digestion. He 
says alcohol promotes the secretion of gastric juice by directly 
irritating the gastric mucous membrane; and after its absolution, 
it brings about a more profuse and sustained flow of gastric juice. 
Zuntz - considers beer, when consumed to the extent of 60 grammes 
of alcohol daily, had no deleterious effect on digestion. Mogilianski 
showed that the assimilation of fat decreases under the influence 
of small doses, but increases when moderately large doses of alcohol 
are consumed. 

The Habitual Use of Alcohol.- — There are many persons who, 
during all tlu ir lives, coiisunie what they call a moderate quantity 
of alcohol daily, and to all appearance are none the worse for it, 
declare themselves to be better for it, are healthy, and die at a 
good old age. Such cases are often quoted to prove the harmlcssness 
of the regular use of alcohol. But for one person who keeps well 
and lives to advanced age, hundreds succumb early to diseases 
acknowledged to be caused or aggravated by alcohol. There is 
likewise a class of people, by no means small, to whom even a small

HABITUAL USE OF ALCOHOL 253 

dose of alcohol is an undoubted poison; and a still larger class to 
whom the daily use of a moderate dose of alcohol is a direct or 
indirect cause of ailments which render life miserable and shorten 
its duration. The demands of city life on the nervous system is 
given as a satisfactory reason for the regular use of alcohol by 
many people. But the bcneftts derived from alcohol by persons 
in health could be obtained from other foodstuffs. Very few people 
would be any worse if they did not take it, and very many 
would be better if they abstained from it. It should be looked upon 
us a luxury ! But medical opinion is divided. In one division 
there is Sir Victor Horsley,^ who says; " The contention that small 
doses of alcohol, such as people take with their meals, had prac- 
tically no deleterious effect, could not be maintained. It renders 
the consumer more liable to microbic invasion. ... Its effect on 
the brain is marked. There is first a quickening of cerebral action, 
lasting only a few minutes, followed by a marked diminution of 
cerebral activity lasting from two to four hours. . . . The disadvan- 
tageous effect on the performance of muscular work is well known ; 
indeed, the best physical results are obtained without alcohol." 
Bunge-'says: " There is a strong belief that alcohol gives new- 
strength and energy after fatigue sets in. This is erroneous. The 
idea originates from a paralytic deadening of the sense of fatigue. . . . 
AlcohoLmaJces no one stronger. . . . Even if w^e grant alcohol is a 
s6urce~of energy, it is far Smaller than that contained in the carbo- 
hydrate from which it is derived." Another leader says : " Although 
primarily an appetizer, alcohol destroys appetite and hinders 
digestion. Its stimulating effect is only momentary, and after this 
passes off, the capacity for work falls continuously. It calls up the 
reserve energies of the body. It does not conserve energy, but 
dissipates it. It does not keep out the cold, but lowers the tem- 
perature of the body. As an energy producer, it is extravagant 
and may lead to bankruptcy." 

The other division contains equally distinguished leaders. A 
manifesto signed by Crichton-Browne, Dyce-Duckworth, Jonathan 
Huchinson, Robert Hutchison, Fraser, Gowers, Halliburton, and 
McCall Anderson, was published in the Lancet, March 30, 1907. 
It states that: "As an article of diet we hold the universal behef 
of civilized mankind, that the moderate use of alcoholic beverages 
by adults is usually beneficial, is amply justified. We deplore the 
evils arising from the abuse of alcohol, but it is obxious that there 
is nothing, however beneficial, which does not by excess become 
injurious." 

Definition of a Moderate Quantity of Alcohol. — This question is 
difficult to answer because the personal equation figures largely in 
the probl(im. We cannot do better than take the figures previously 
quoted from Parkes, Wollowicz, Atwater, and Rosa. According 
to the former, the body is capable of completely oxidizing a liquid

2 54 STIMULANTS 

iquivaK'nt to i\ or 2 ounces of absolute alcohol. The maximum 
would be contained in 4 to 6 ounces of whisky or brandy, 10 to 
20 ounces of wine, or ij to 2 pints of beer, according as a high or 
low quality is consumed. There are many people who can dispose 
of more, and some who cannot oxidize even these amounts, thereby 
illustrating the adage, " One man's food is another man's poison." 
Respecting the time of day when alcohol should be taken, the best 
advice to give is, " Never take it except with meals, and never 
before the midday meal;" for many people it is prudent to take it " 
only with the last meal of the day. 

Th-c Effects of Excessive Consumption. — Alcohol yields 7-1 calories 
of energy per gramme, but it is unknown to what extent the muscles 
use it. It causes a greater loss of heat by radiation from the body 
than it yields. It does not give strength, but diminishes muscular 
power while deadening the sense of fatigue. It is like a whip to a 
tired horse. In small doses it spares nitrogen by diminishing the 
output ; large doses increase the output. In large doses it spares 
the consumption of carbohydrate and fat. It diminishes cerebral 
power. The continued use of alcohol causes loss of appetite, and 
may produce anorexia, nausea, vomiting; a slight excess tends to 
lessen the tone of the stomach, leads to atony, chronic catarrh, 
and possibly dilatation of the stomach. The portal vessels become 
engorged, leading to hyperemia of the liver, which in turn causes 
catarrh of the stomach and bowels. The cells of the liver may 
undergo fatty infiltration or degeneration. When the excess is 
long continued, it irritates the fibrous elements of the liver, leading 
to hypei"plasia, and ultimately cirrhosis. The effect of alcohol on the 
kidneys is similar to that on the liver, granular kidney being common. 

As regards the heart, the increased frequency of the pulse after 
alcohol is commonly cited as an instance of its stimulating effect. 
But this is due to its action on the nerves and not on the muscle. 
Crilc says shock is aggravated by alcohol. The excessive use of 
alcohol deteriorates the cardiac muscle, as it does other cellular 
organs. It leads to a permanent enfeeblement of contractile 
power, dilatation of the ventricles, flagging of the circulation, venous 
congestion of the abdominal organs, engorgement of the portal 
circulation, gastro-intcstinal catarrh, and gradual failure of general 
nutrition. 

The primary dilatation of the bloodvessels resulting from a dose 
of alcohol tends to become permanent when it is taken regularly 
or in excess. The small vessels of the skin, liver, stomach, and 
bowels are constantly dilated. Alcohol also causes an increase 
of the fibrous-tissue elements {arteriosclerosis), accompanied by 
fatty degeneration or calcification. The increased fibrosis of the 
vessels throws an increased strain on the heart, and the tendency 
to blood-stasis and failure of nutrition is again observed. The 
degenerative processes in the vessels lead to serious changes in the 
cerebral structures, to say nothing of haemorrhages from ruptured 
vessels leading to apoplexy or mental decay. 



ABUSE OF ALCOHOL 255 

On the nervous system, chronic alcohohsm produces marked 
changes. Horsley says it produces degeneration and ultimate 
destruction of nerves and their processes, and there is a gradual 
increase of neuroglia or supj)orting tissue. Its effect on the periph- 
eral nerves is best seen in the cases of alcoholic neuritis occurring 
chiefly in women. It has also been shown that epilepsy is fre- 
quently due to alcoholism in the individual or his parents. Hysteria 
also arises, in many cases, from the nervous instability due to alco- 
holism in the individual or parents. Alcoholic insanity is on the 
increase. In the report for 1903 of the Morningside Asylum, Dr. 
Clouston said: " This year no less than 42-3 per cent, of the male 
and 18 per cent, of the female patients had excess of alcohol assigned 
as the cause of their insanity. . . . For every man in whom excessive 
drinking causes insanity, there are twenty in whom it injures the 
brain, blunts the moral sense, and lessens the capacity for work." 

The effects of alcohol vary. No single case shows all the effects 
detailed. Some symptoms occur in one case, others in another. 
This is probably due to the form of alcohol. It is usually stated 
that the injurious effects of alcohol increase with the atomic weight, 
each alcohol in the scale being more injurious than the one below it. 
It follows that propyl, butyl, amyl, heptyl, and hexyl alcohols 
are more injurious than ethyl alcohol; the aldehydes and secondary 
alcohols are worse than the primary alcohols. All these are 
grouped^ "together as fusel-oil. Furfural, or furfurane aldehyde, 
occurs in many wines and spirits, and arises from pentoses in the 
grain. It is very poisonous, causes epileptiform convulsions, and is 
probably responsible for alcoholic epilepsy. It is commonly present 
in grain spirit, immature whisky, absinthe, vermouth, other 
liqueurs, and to a small extent in beer. Amyl alcohol is from 
three to fifteen times as intoxicating as ethyl alcohol. It is a 
powerful poison: 2 drops are fatal to a guinea-pig; 60 drops 
caused a dog to be giddy, have muscular tremors, followed by 
paralysis of the hind-legs, foaming at the mouth, and coma lasting 
five hours. According to Ordonneau, 100 litres of brandy contain 
83-8 grammes of amyl alcohol, 218 of butyl, 40 of propyl, o-6 hexyl, 
and 1-6 heptyl alcohols. The same amount of whisky contains 
24 grammes ot amyl, 63 of butyl, and 117 of propyl alcohols. 

Effect of Alcohol on Duration of Life. — Statistics show that the 
mortality among intemperate people is four or five times greater 
than that of sti-ictly temperate people. This fact has been recog- 
nized by life insurance companies. They offer an advantage to 
teetotallers, and charge inebriates a higher rate of premium. 

Alcohol in Sickness. — " Alcohol is a rapid and trustworthy 
restorative. In many cases it is truly life-preserving, owing to its 
power to sustain cardiac and nervous energy."^ It is employed 
in many diseases. It was formerly much used in enteric fever, 
pneumonia, and all asthenic conditions, as much as 10 to 20 ounces 
of brandy in twenty-four hours being prescribed. Examples are 
1 " Manifesto on Alcohol," Lancet, March 30, 1907. 



2 56 STIMULANTS 

gix'on by Anstic' of patients kept alive by brandy, without food, 
who did not waste so much as if they had been hN-ing on tlieir own 
tissues. One ounce of brandy containing 35 per cent, of alcohol 
by weight yields 64 calories, good brandy having 45 per cent, 
yields 89 calories, and superior brandy (50 per cent.) yields 100 
calories. Therefore 16 ounces of superior brandy would be required 
to supply the energy expended during absolute rest in bed by a 
person taking no food, supposing no more than 2 or 3 per cent, of 
alcohol escaped oxidation. But the experience gained in temper- 
ance hospitals proved that alcohol is not essential in asthenic 
diseases, that patients did as well without it, and in some cases it 
was injurious. Its place as a cardiac and nervous stimulant is 
taken by str}chnia, ammonia, nmsk, and other drugs. But the 
use of alcohol should not be entirely discarded. If the consumption 
is limited to 2 ounces of alcohol, =,1 ounces of brandy or whisky, 
it may help a patient through the crisis of pneumonia or enteric 
fever by stimulating the flagging circulation, soothing the nervous 
system, producing sleep, enlivening the mind, and encouraging 
the patient. 

There is considerable difference of opinion about the action of 
alcohol on the heart. Loeb, Rachem, and Dixon assert that small 
doses increase its contractile power. Munro and Findlay say it 
has never been proved that the heart muscle is stimulated by it. 
Martin and Stevens showed that blood containing a ^ of i per cent, 
diminished the contractile power. With regard to blood-pressure, 
Stockmann found nioderate doses of alcohol do not influence blood- 
pressure ; large doses cause a fall of pressure. Charteris and Cathcart 
found pure malt pot-still whisky first causes the pulse-rate to rise and 
then sink to its former rate. The blood-pressure is slightly reduced. 
Patent still whisky causes the pulse-rate to rise 10 per minute, 
then to fall slightly below normal. The pressure varies with the 
pulse. Absolute alcohol caused a slight reduction of pressure. 
Clinical experiments in pneumonia showed no reduction in pressure 
after taking alcohol when the heart was embarrassed. Therefore 
there is nO' better rule that the old dictum: " So long as alcohol 
reduces the pulse-rate, steadies the heart, and increases its tone, it 
is doing good." But_alcohol is not a food for the heart; it enables 
it to draw on its reserved strength. The period of over-activity 
may be followed by depression, in which the cardiac beat is feebler 
than in the unstimulated period. This should be a warning not 
to prescribe alcohol in the early stage of acute diseases, lest the 
depression comes on before the 'crisis. 

In enteric fever, alcohol is not necessary as a matter of routine. 
But it is of great value in continued high temperature, when there 
is a feeble running or dicrotic pulse, muttering delirium, muscular 
tremors, and other signs of great septic intoxication. 

Alcohol is not essential in an ordinary case of pneumonia, so long 
as the heart is able to do its work, and the circulation is good. 
^ " Stimulants and Xarcotics." 



ALCOHOL IN SICKNESS 257 

But if the heart begins to fail, a stinmlaiit, not necessarily alcohol, 
is necessary. If the pulse becomes small, rapid, feeble, and irregular, 
the breathing embarrassed, the lips and nose cyanosed, the right 
side of the heart over-distended, all the help which can be obtained 
is necessary. There is no doubt that in such cases alcohol is a valuable 
ally and as necessary as strychnia, musk, ether, digitalis, and oxygen. 

Alcohol is useful in other diseases. In many cases of insomnia 
a glass of whisky or stout is a good sedative. In neuralgia and 
other cases of nervous irritability a dietetic quantity of wine, ale. 
or stout, is beneficial. Its use in various conditions is mentioned 
under special diseases. 

There are contra-indications to its use, such as diseases of the 
kidneys and urinary passages, the diseases peculiar to women, 
and especially the neurotic condition. The relief of pain, and 
especially mental suffering, by alcohol tends to its abuse. A special 
warning is necessary in view of the fact that female intemperance 
is rapidly increasing. 

Respecting the use of particular alcoholic beverages, the follow- 
ing remarks should be read in connection with the foregoing account 
of the effects of alcohol. 

Malt Liquors. — -Beer, ale, and stout, by virtue of their taste, 
aromatic bitters and tonics, give a relish to food, increase appetite, 
and promote the flow of saliva. To this extent they assist digestion. 
They are useful to convalescents, those enfeebled by chronic 
diseases, and the aged. They are of some value to those whose 
occupation is sedentary, whose stomach has lost tone by over- 
work, rush, and worry, and to sufferers from neuralgia and 
insomnia. The limit should be i pint a day. They are contra- 
indicated in neurotic conditions, diabetes, gout, rheumatism, obesity, 
and genito-urinary diseases. 

Cider and Perry are useful in some cases of gout, obesity, rheu- 
matism, calculus, renal diseases, and occasionally in diabetes. Dry 
cider, being free from sugar, is the best. Rough cider is said to be 
particularly good for gout and rheumatism. Sweet and champagne 
cider are contra-indicated in gout, rheumatism, and diabetes. 

Spirits. — -The physiological action of brandy, whisky, rum, and 
gin is not due to alcohol alone. They contain ethers and aldehydes, 
developed during maturation. It is important that spirits should 
be of a good age, not less than ten years old. The ethereal products 
not only stimulate the heart, they influence the central nervous 
system and the vegetative functions. Brandy is the best spirit 
for most acute cases. Cognac and liqueur brandy are the best forms. 
Cheap spirits are injurious. The dose is 2 to 4 drachms every two 
or three hours, and the total should not exceed 4 or 5 ounces a day. 
The aphorism of Armstrong and Graves is of value: (i) It is doing 
good if the tongue becomes moist, the pulse slower and fuller, the 
breathing tranquil, and the skin moist; (2) it is doing harm if the 
tongue becomes dry and baked, the pulse and breathing quicker, 
the skin dry and parched. When the acute stage of a febrile disease 

17 



2S8 STIMULANTS 

is over, brandy is no longer necessary. But when the temperature 
becomes subnonnal and the pulse is very feeble, good wine may be 
beneficial. Ajcohol is only of temporary value, and its use should 
be discontinued as soon as possible. 

In chronic diseases brandy is useful sometimes, especially for 
spasmodic affections, angina, s^'ncope, etc. It is probable that the 
ethers and aldehydes contained are beneficial and have saved many 
lives. 

Whisky is said to be the best alcohol in chronic pulmonary 
diseases; but it is useful in some of the cases where brandy is 
ser\-iceable. It docs not contain so much ether as brand}^ and rum, 
but there /is more aldehyde, especially in pure malt whisky made 
in the pot-still. Whisky is allowed to gouty, rheumatic, and diabetic 
persons, and in some cases of atony of the stomach. " Low forms 
of bronchitis, congestion of the lungs, influenza, typhoid . . . cases 
of breakdown from ovei"v^ork, all characterized by weakness of 
the heart, failing circulation, inability to take food, loss of power to 
sleep, and exhaustion, come into the category of suitable cases." ^ 

Rum is not prescribed so often as brandy or whisky, although 
it is the richest in ethers, which suggests a medicinal use for it. It 
is a popular remedy for chronic cough and general debility, being 
frequently combined with raw eggs and spruce beer. 

Gin has undoubted qualities as a stimulant, aromatic, anti- 
spasmodic, and diuretic. It derives these properties from the 
essential oils of calamus, angelica, grains of paradise, cardamoms, 
cassia, juniper, and coriander. Its range of application is wide. 
As a popular remedy its use needs to be restricted rather than 
encouraged. All kinds of gin are not equally palatable, but many 
of them make an agreeable beverage when diluted with sweetened 
water. The oil of juniper, which predominates in Holland gin, 
gives a less agreeable flavour. 

Liqueurs all contain aromatics and carminatives similar to gin; 
but tin y are not all alike. Benedictine, Chartreuse, cura^oa, and 
absinthe have similar properties to gin, but arc not diuretic. Green 
Chartreuse is made from balm, hyssop, peppermint, thyme, genepi, 
angelica, buds of poplar, cinnamon, and mace. Cura^oa from 
cura9oa rinds and fresh orange peel. Absinthe from wormwood, 
peppermint, anise, fennel, calamus, and lemon rind. Dutch bitters 
from cura^oa, calamus, socotrine aloes, and Brazil wood. Anisette 
from aniseed, almonds, coriander, fennel, bay leaves, nutmeg, etc. 
There are many liqueurs. Their composition and properties vary 
according to the whim or fancy of the manufacturer. Originally 
they were distilled, but now some of them are only tinctures of the 
herbs, and others are merely coloured solutions of artificial oils 
and bitters. 

Wines.^ — When wine is prescribed for therapeutical purposes, it 
should be of good quality. To obtain such it is advisable to take 
the opinion of the salesman. Claret (the red and white Bordeaux 

^ Murray, " Kough Notes on Remedies," p. 125. 



ALCOHOL IN SICKNESS 259 

wines) is of value in all cases of debility, not merely as a stimulant, 
but as a genuine tonic and restorative. A true red claret is less 
stimulating than white claret, and much less so than either red or 
white Burgundy. This tonic property depends largely on the 
amount of tannin combined with a low percentage of alcohol. 
The composition of clarets differs very little, although the physical 
characters differ greatly. The wines of Chateaux Haut Brion, 
St. Emilion, and St. Raphael contain more tannin than any others. 
It is of value in cases of anaemia, general debility, overwork, enfeebled 
digestion, and similar ailments. When people are able to eat very 
little food in warm weather, and become debilitated thereby, it 
may be advantageous for them to take some claret with their meals. 
The astringent propertj'of this wine renders it valuable in atonic and 
bilious forms of indigestion, diarrhcea, and relaxed conditions or 
passive congestion of all mucous membranes. It is better than malt 
liquors for persons inclined to obesity. Some writers say red 
claret should not be taken by gouty or rheumatic persons ; but this 
is a mistake, if alcohol is allowed them at all, because it contains 
a smaller proportion of fixed acid than most wines, and is of low 
alcoholic strength. It is certainly better than malt liquors. White 
Bordeaux wines, or sauternes are of two qualities: the first growth 
of Haut Sauterne, Graves, and Y'Quem, are sweet and have con- 
siderable strength. They have a primary stimulating, and 
secondary sedative effect, and are recommended for nervous and 
excitable persons, of a thin and irritable disposition, and for pul- 
monary cases when exhausted by racking cough and want of sleep. 
They are not prescribed as a tonic or restorative, and they are 
contra-indicated by gout, rheumatism, diabetes, and obesity. 
Wines of the second growth are thin, acidulous, and contain only 
I grain of sugar per ounce. They are suitable for bilious persons 
and those who are obese or tend to get fat ; and as an occasional 
beverage for the diabetic. They are unsuitable for ansemic persons 
whose tissues are soft and flabby; also for people with passive con- 
gestions, lax mucous membranes, a tendency to diarrhoea, or acid 
dyspepsia. Gouty people should take them with caution on account 
of their acidity, which tends to increase with age. Burgundy 
possesses more body, and is said to be more " generous " than 
claret; but it has not so fine a flavour and bouquet. It is more 
potent than claret, and is superior to other wines for an?emia, 
general debility, feebleness of constitution, and malnutrition, pro- 
\-ided the alimentary organs are in good condition. It is not so 
good a stomachic as claret, because it contains less tannin. The 
stimulating effect is followed by a marked sedative effect, which is 
sufficient to enable it to replace bromide in some persons of a nervous 
and excitable nature with weak physical powers. It contains little 
sugar, and may be taken occasionally by diabetic and rheumatic 
persons. Gouty persons cannot take it with impunity, nor is it 
■^uitable for obese or plethoric people. Among the best Burgundy 
wines are Romance, Clos de Vougeot, Chambertin, Musigny, 



26o STIMULANTS 

Richoburg, I.a Taclic, and \'olnay. Maqon and Bcaujolais arc 
intonncdiate between claret and Burgundy. 

White Burgundy wines (Chablis, Mersault, and Montrachet) 
vary in character; therefore care is necessary in prescribing them. 
They are more stimulating and exciting than white Bordeaux 
wines. They contain slight! j' less alcohol, but more acid. They 
should not be recommended as general tonics or even as refrigerants 
unkss well diluted. They are apt to cause or aggravate dyspepsia, 
heartburn, and acidity, and are slightly aperient. They are not 
suitable for diabetic, gouty, or dyspeptic persons. As a tonic, red 
wines are preferable. Mersault and Montrachet are useful restora- 
tives after acute diseases and operations, being preferable to sherry 
or port. Moselle is recommended for persons suffering from 
calculus, rheumatism, some forms of indigestion and intestinal 
diseases attended by constipation, and other diseases of metabolism. 
It is wholesome, light, agreeable, and has slight acidity. Hock 
has similar properties. Tokay contains a larger proportion of 
phosphoric acid than any other wine, and is n useful tonic. Cham- 
pagne varies considerabh' in character and quality. The natural 
champagne, viii brut, has no added spirit cr sugar. Dry champagne 
is allowed to persons suffering from gout, rheumatism, ineligestion, 
and other diseases when a non-saccharine light wine is considered 
desirable. It is ser\-iceable in acute illness attended by vomiting 
or hevHi failure, and in convalescence. Champagne which is acid, 
sweeten<:d by sugar, and fortified with brandy, hke the majority 
sold as a beverage, is injurious to the gouty, causes indigestion, 
heartburn, acidity, and other discomfort. Sherry contains more 
alcohol than the foregoing wines; it is also sweeter, and contains 
a higli proportion of acids. Sweetness is due to added sugar; 
strength to brandy. It is rich in volatile ethers and aldehydes, 
which give it a special value in many cases of debility, nervous 
exhaustion, and convalescence, if a sweet wine is not contra-indicated. 
It is not suitable for diabetics. The high acidity contra-indicates 
it for gastric, gout}', and rheumatic person.^. What has been said 
of sherry applies almost equally to port, which likewise contains a 
high proportion of ethers, aldehydes, alcohol, and sugar. The 
tannin renders it of value as a stomachic, and it is credited with 
making good blood; wherefore it is prescribed in anaemia, atony 
of the stomach, a relaxed state of mucous membranes, and muscular 
weakness. It is not suitable for persons suffering from gout, rheu- 
matism, calculus, uric acid gravel, diabetes, and other disorders of 
metabohsm. Tarragona port lacks the fine qualities of mature port; 
but when genuine, it has stomachic properties, and is of value in 
ajisemia anei general debility. Valdepeiias and Rioja wines are inter- 
mediate between port and claret as regards their characteristics and 
uses. The same remark appHes to the red wines of Italy. Carlowitz, 
a Hungarian wine, is more distinctly of the port wine type; Malaga 
and Madeira wines arc similar. Australian anel Califomian wines 
are near to Burgundy wines in character, and have similar uses. 



EFFECTS OF TEA 261 



Tea, Coffee, and Allied Substances. 

The vcf^etablc stiinulaut.s depend cliicUy 011 caffein or thein 
(^8^io^'4^2) ^or their most \'a.luable properties. The proportion 
of caffeiu in tea varies from 1-35 to 175, roasted coffee 075 to 2-05, 
Guarana 5-0, kola 2-0, and mate 1-15, per cent. In cocoa it is 
replaced by 0-97 per cent, of theobromin (C7HgX402) ; and in khat 
[Cat/hi ediUis) by katin, which is allied to caffeui. A small proportion 
of essential oil exists m most of these vegetables. That in coffee 
is an aromatic substance giving flavour to the beverage. These 
vegetables all contain some form of tannin. In tea it is pure tannic 
acid and gallo-tannic acid; in coffee it is caffeo-tannic acid. In 
tea the tannin averages 15 per cent., being only 6 per cent, in 
China tea, 10 per cent, in Indian, and may reach as high as ^^ per 
cent, in Assam, and even higher in Young Hyson and Caper tea. 
The kind of tannin differs in various parts of the leaf. The woody 
libre forming the mid-rib and veins of the leaves contains crude 
tannin or gallo-tannic acid, but in the edge of the leaves and 
between the veins it is pure tannic acid. The amount of tannin in 
the edge of the leaves reaches only 6 per cent. ; the caffein in the same 
part reaches 3-5 per cent., and is much above the average. 

Effects of Tea. — The proportion of tea commonly used is two 
teaspoonsful to a pint. The water should be fresh boiled and 
immediately poured over the leaves. It should be infused for 
three to live minutes, and then poured off. Long infusion causes 
a loss of the essential oil on which it depends for aroma. At the 
same time it extracts tannin, resinoid matters, gum, pectin, dextrin, 
and other matters which give " body " but add nothing to the 
refreshing qualities of the beverage. Tea is a stimulant and restora- 
tive of a high order. It removes the sensation of fatigue, clears 
the brain, and promotes intellectual activity. These effects are 
due chiefly to the action of the essential oil and caffein on the nervous 
system, and in a lesser degree to the hot water and sugar. It 
stimulates the general circulation, in consequence of which the flow 
of blood through the brain is quickened, its cells flooded with oxygen 
and food, and the products of metabolism removed. Caffein also 
rouses the nerve cells to activity and increases the power for mental 
and muscular work. It diminishes the tendency to sleep, and 
when taken to excess, may cause insomnia. McDougall, who 
physically investigated the effects of all the ordinary stimulants, 
found tea aroused the faculty of attention and association of ideas. 
Rivers^ found "caffein increases the capacity for both muscular 
and mental work, the stimulating action persisting for a consider- 
able time after the substance has been taken, and, with moderate 
doses, there is no evidence of reaction." 

The effects of tea on the alimentary system should be noticed. 
It deadens the sensation of hunger, and enables the body to fast 

* " The Croonian Lectures," 1906. 



262 STIMULANTS 

longer than it coukl witliout it. The tannin inhibits salivary and 
peptic digestion. The influence of tea in retarding the digestion 
of meat, lish. and other proteins is in proportion to the amount of 
tannin. Indigestion, atony, or catarrh of the stomach, is frequently 
due to excessive tea-drinking, and dyspepsia due to mental work, 
worry, or anxiety, is often kept up by tea and cured soon after its 
use is dropped. A cup of tea primarily encourages the action of 
the bowels in the same way as other warm liquids; but an excess 
of tea may cause constipation by its influence on the nervous system 
and the astringent efft ct of tannin. On metabolism the effect is 
not very marked. Caffein is destroyed in the tissues for the most 
part. Maly and Schultzkiver' found that when o-io gramme of 
caffein was taken internally, 0-066 gramme reappeared in the urine; 
but when injected subcutaneously, only o-oo6 gramme reappeared 
in the urine. An ordinary amount of tea or coffee contains about 
o-io gramme of caffein, none of which can be detected in the urine 
as a rule ; but when 0-5 gramme of caffein is taken, it can be detected. 
Caffein is closely allied to xanthin, and Bungc^ says: " It is possible 
that the caffein molecule, in consequence of its similar constitution, 
has an affinity for the same elements in which xanthin is found, and 
that it plan's an analogous but modified part. This may explain 
the stimulating action of caffein." 

An excess of tea is injurious. The excitement of the nervous 
system may be carried to excess and result in insomnia, palpitation 
of the heart, flushing of the face, muscular tremors, and other signs 
of nervous irritabilit}^ Rivers^ found that an excess of caffein 
has a very transitory stimulating effect, and may be an accelerator 
of fatigue, and " experiments suggest that caffein is a dangerous 
stimulant in cases of prolonged fatigue or in that tendency to fatigue 
which characterizes neurasthenia." Smoking tea in cigarettes is 
probably the most injurious mode of consuming it, the nervous 
symptoms being much increased. 

Effects of Coffee. — Most of what is written about tea applies to 
coffee. It is aromatic and refreshing, enlivens the mind, stimulates 
mental activit}^ invigorates the muscular system, and removes the 
sense of fatigue. Its effect increases with the dose when it is taken 
in moderation. More coffee than tea is used to make an infusion. 
This should be borne in mind when comparing these beverages. 
The aromatic oil is dissipated by boiling, and the best temperature 
of the water is 210° F. — i.e., not quite boiling. The excessive use 
of coffee leads to insomnia; indeed, many people who are not accus- 
tomed to it cannot sleep after taking a cup of coffee in the evening. 
Such persons are very liable to nervous symptoms after its use. 
It sensibly disturbs the heart, produces an uncomfortable feeling, 
causes it to become intermittent, and a sense of impending danger 
may arise. In other persons the circulation is improved, and a 
feeling of well-being follows a moderate dose of coffee. It has a

EFFECTS OF COFFEE 263 

lieneficial effect on the respiratory function, the excretion of COg 
being increased; the sweat glands arc stimulated, and there is 
increased loss of heat from the skin. Thus coffee warms the body 
in winter and cools it in summer. Caffco-tannic acid has a smaller 
effect in retarding salivary and pancreatic digestion than the 
corresponding principle in tea; but it retards gastric digestion more, 
and strong coflEec or cafe noir has a still greater inhibitory effect. 
Its influence on the intestines is salutary, the morning cup of coffee 
being slightly aperient by increasing the peristaltic action. It is 
diuretic in proportion to the amount of caffein, due to its action on 
the nervous system and the renal cells. 

Various brands of coffee free from caffein are sold. These lack 
many of the fine qualities of the genuine article, but they are useful 
for persons who suffer from nervous affections, insomnia, arterio- 
sclerosis, etc., and who ought to be debarred from using ordinary 
coffee. Roasted coffee is frequently adulterated with chicory, 
dandelion, beetroot, figs, acorns, mangolds, turnips, and cereals. 
These substances, when roasted, give colour and body to the 
infusion, but are devoid of caffein. 

In the treatment of disease coffee may be prescribed as a cardiac 
stimulant in dropsy, whether due to failure of the heart, kidneys, 
or liver. It is most valuable in chronic alcoholism, asthma, in- 
fluenza, fevers, shock, or collapse, opium-poisoning, coma, and 
various other acute conditions. It may be used to vary the milk 
diet in many cases of illness. Its restorative action raises the spirits 
and cheers the individual who is depressed by his health. It is 
of especial value in melancholia, and other states of depression. 
For nervous headache and migraine its value is well established. 
But experiments led Rivers to conclude that caffein is a dangerous 
remedy in " that tendency to fatigue which is characteristic of 
neurasthenia." It is beneficial to the gouty by virtue of its action 
on the kidneys, but it may upset their digestive organs. When 
this occurs, coffee free from chicory and other adulterants should 
only be allowed. Acorn coffee is valuable in cases of chronic diar- 
rhfea. 

Mate, or Paraguay tea, of South America and Apalache tea of 
North America consist of the leaves of varieties of Ilex, which are 
dried, roasted, and reduced to coarse powder. They contain 
1-25 per cent, of caffein, 7 per cent, of tannin, and a yellow volatile 
oil having stimulating properties. Guarana from Paullina sorbilis 
contains about 5 per cent, of caffein. These substances are used 
as ordinary beverages in their native country. In Europe the in- 
fusions are chiefly used as a remedy for migraine, but they are useless 
against headache arising from gastric and hepatic disturbances. 
Kola contains a glucoside, kolanin, which splits under the influence 
of an enzyme into caffein, kola-red, and glucose. It also contains 
a small amount of theobromin, which places it in an intermediate 
position between coffee and cocoa. Like tea and coffee, it enables 
the consumer to bear fatigue during prolonged fasting by increasing 



264 STIMULANTS 

the power of endurance for mental and physical strain. It is a 
stimulant and restorative of high value, especially after influenza, 
in myocarditis, bradj'cardia, mental depression, etc. 

Effects of Cocoa.— It is something more than a stimulant: it is 
a food. It contains 7-5 to 16-5 per cent, of starch, 7 to 20 per cent, 
of nitrogenous matters, and 27 to 52 per cent, of fat. The active 
principle is theobromin, of which it contains 0-65 to 2-25 per cent. 
Cocoa is not so stimulating as tea, coffee, and kola, but it is more 
nourishing. In its natural condition it is not easily digested, because 
of the fat. But most commercial varieties have a considerable 
proportion of fat removed, and ma}^ contain as little as 20 per cent. 
According to Cohn,^ most of the fat and half the protein is digested. 
Prepared cocoa usually contains added sugar; natural cocoa con- 
tains only I or 2 per cent, of dextrose and 0-25 to 1-5 per cent, of 
saccharose; prepared cocoa has 25 to 30 per cent, of saccharose 
(cane-sugar), and the same amount of starch. The action of 
theobromin or dimethyl xanthin on the muscles and nerve centres 
is similar to that of caffein and xanthin,^ with this difference: its 
action on the central nervous system is less pronounced ; its effects 
on the muscles, heart, and kidneys is more pronounced. As a 
drug it is used principally as a diuretic. Therefore cocoa may be 
prescribed safely in those cases where tea and coffee excite the 
nervous system, cause palpitation, nervous tremors, and insomnia. 
It may likewise be prescribed as a beverage in dropsy and heart 
failure. Prepared cocoa cannot be allowed to diabetics, but cocoa- 
nibs, consisting merely of the seeds, hulled, crushed, and roasted, 
may be used b}^ them. A decoction is made by boiling cocoa-nibs 
in water for two hours, the dark brown liquid being then poured off 
from the residue. This beverage may also be allowed in renal 
diseases. 

Coca. — The leaves of Erythroxylon coca are used to an enormous 
extent in South America. The physiological effects are due to 
the alkaloids, which place it in the same category as tea and coffee. 
The leaves contain cocain, cinnamyl-cocain, iso-atropyl-cocain, 
and tropa-cocain, besides coca-tannic acid, wax, and various 
crystalline bodies which are not alkaloids. The power of coca to 
prevent or remove fatigue is well estabhshed; but commercial leaves 
are not so active in this respect as fresh dried leaves used in their 
native country. It enables the body to endure prolonged exertion 
without food, and prevents nervous and muscular exhaustion. 
But while it prevents nervous exhaustion, dulness, drowsiness, and 
languor, it does not stimulate the mental faculties in the same 
degree as tea or coffee. Indeed, the excessive use of coca con- 
siderably diminishes the intellectual powers, and deteriorates the 
moral faculties. This is said to be due to iso-atropyl-cocain, which 
benumbs the cerebral faculties, and may reduce the confirmed

causing insomnia, hallucinations, delusions, muscular inco-ordina- 
tion, tremors, convulsions, etc. Coca-wine, cordial, elixir, and 
infusion arc valuable remedies for nervous debility, mental strain 
resulting from overwork or worry, cardiac weakness, bradycardia, 
tachycardia, and convalescence. But the patient should not be 
allowed a free hand in using them. Symptoms of the cocain habit 
begin with disorders of digestion, loss of appetite, and emacia- 
tion; the heart soon becomes feeble, irregular, and intermittent. 
This is followed by nervous symptoms and perhaps moral 
depravity. 

Tobacco. — -The physiological effects of tobacco are — (i) A short 
period of stimulation of the nervous system followed by depression ; 
(2) a similar stimulation of the sympathetic system followed by 
lasting depressicn; (3) an action like curare on the terminal plates 
of the motor nerves in the muscles; (4) when death occurs it is 
due to failure of the respiratory movements. Tobacco first slows 
the heart and prolongs its contraction; the blood-pressure is raised 
by the constriction of the arterioles, due to primary excitation of 
the vasomotor centres. It thereby temporarily increases the flow 
of blood through the cerebral arteries, and stimulates the brain by 
the free supply of oxygen and nutritive pabulum. To this extent 
it aids the intellectual faculties, but that it stimulates the cells of 
the cortex cannot be conceded. The secondary effect on the 
nervous system is sedative, whence it may be said " it soothes and 
cheers the weary toiler and solaces the overworked brain." Many 
men of large intellect are great smokers, and the beneficial effect is 
probably due to a direct sedative effect on the nerve cells. When 
the smoking is carried to excess, it causes degeneration of the same 
cells, and leads to loss of power of thought, enfeeblement of the 
attention or power of concentration, and deterioration of the 
memory. It is neither a food nor a stimulant to the muscles. 
Rivers showed by the ergograph that it has an unfavourable effect 
on muscular work. This is to be expected from its action on the 
nerve-endings in the muscles. It reheves the sensation of hunger 
and enables the smoker to endure fasting. A pipe of tobacco after a 
meal, by suppressing the inhibition of the vagus, causes the gastric 
mucous membrane to be flushed with blood, the gastric juice to be 
secreted freely; the intestinal secretions and movements are Uke- 
wise promoted. But long-continued and excessive use of tobacco 
causes a diminution of the gastric and intestinal secretions and 
movements. Dyspepsia and catarrh are induced, and nutrition 
is impeded. The assimilation and metaboHsm of nitrogen is lowered.^ 
The heart-beat is first made slower and stronger, but owing to its 
influence on the vagus, it soon becomes quicker and often beats 
25 to 50 per cent, more frequently than normal. Excessive smoking 
increases the excitability of the heart, it becomes intermittent and 
irregular, and in some cases tachycardia, in others bradycardia, is

developed. Tinnitus aiirium occurs, and amblyopia or amaurosis 
with a central scoloma, is quite common. 

What is a moderate amount of tobacco ? This question is not 
easy to answer. There are men who smoke 2 ounces of tobacco a 
day in a pipe, others use 10 to 15 cigars, or 80 to 100 cigarettes. 
These are examples of excess. As a general rule 2 ounces of tobacco 
in a pipe would be enough for one week; but, like other stimulants, 
an excess for one man would not affect another. The injurious 
effects of tobacco have been attributed to various principles. The 
juice from 10 kilos of tobacco yielded 1,000 grammes of nicotine, 
20 grammes of nicotiene, 5 grammes of nicotinine, and i gramme, 
of nicotelUne. Nicotine is the principal agent. French tobacco 
contains 7 or 8 per cent., Virginian and Kentucky leaves 6 or 7, 
and Havanna only 2 per cent. Nicotine is only partially destroyed 
by smoking. Some authorities found only 50 per cent, was broken 
down; the rest is inhaled. The smoke contains nicotine, pyridine, 
hydrocyanic acid, ammonia, and carbon monoxide. Nicotine is a 
powerful poison. PjTidine is also a poison. It paralyzes sensation. 
Small doses stimulate and large ones paralyze the heart muscle. 
Gawalowski considers it forms a combination — nicotine-pyridyl 
carbonate — which is the injurious principle in smoke. Thoms 
considers an ethereal oil is produced which causes giddiness, head- 
ache, and muscular tremors. The carbon monoxide is perhaps too 
insignificant to have a serious effect. The same remark probably 
applies to the trace of arsenic which has been detected in tobacco. 

Spices and Condiments. 

The essential principles in our food are, for the most part, devoid 
of taste. Proteins are insipid and odourless, and fats are tasteless 
when quite pure. Sugars alone of the carbohydrates have a sweet 
and agreeable taste. With the exception of this class of materials, 
our essential foodstuffs, when pure, would soon pall on the palate, 
and, by monotony, lead to satiety and disgust. Nature wisely 
mingles with them various aromatic and savoury bodies which give 
taste and odour to our foods, and increases the desire for, and 
pleasure in, eating them. So keen is the effect produced by some 
of these flavouring agents, that the thought, smell, or taste of them 
produces a desire to eat and a flow of the digestive secretions. The 
aromatic substances in meat, the odour of fruit, and the flavour 
of many other articles is due to volatile agents which produce a 
pleasant effect on the organs of sense, enliven the mind, and promote 
appetite, so that they may be regarded almost as essential as the 
food itself. Man, however, is not satisfied by the natural flavour 
and aroma of his food, but consumes many condiments and spices 
which have a similar effect on his senses. 

It should be noted that some condiments — sugar, molasses, 

^ Oest. Zeit. /. Pharm., Ivi. 432. 



CONDIMENTS 267 

syrups, jam, marmalade, and honey — have hkewise a genuine 
food vahie. Extracts of meat, on the other hand, Hkc salt and 
vnnegar, are almost purely condimental. The small piece of cheese 
eaten at the end of dinner is a condiment of equal value. Common 
salt is largely used as a condiment. It not only promotes the con- 
sumption of food, it encourages the secretion of gastric juice, and 
furthers the solution of proteins. Bunge saj^s more salt is necessary 
in proportion to the amount of potassium in our food, sodium being 
an antidote to potassium. Common salt, sodium chloride, exerts 
a favourable influence on metabolism. An average of 9-5 grammes 
leaves the body in the urine and 0-05 gramme in the fseces — therefore 
a total of 150 grains of salt daily is enough. Many people consume 
a greater quantity, but it should be remembered that when the 
kidneys are defective, the excess may be retained in the body and 
lead to anasarca. Vinegar is used to a less extent, and is not 
injurious in moderation. Pickles derive their appetizing properties 
partly from vinegar and partly from spices. It provokes appetite, 
and a tired person may eat more when it is used. Persons who 
suffer from weak digestion should avoid vinegar and pickles. The 
acetic acid retards salivary digestion, and irritates the gastric mucosa. 
Later on it is converted into an alkaline carbonate. An excessive 
consumption of vinegar causes " ansemia and emaciation; the acid 
tends to lessen the alkalinity of the blood, and the number of blood- 
corpuscles." ^ 

The other condiments fall into two groups: the aromatic spices 
and sweet herbs. Aromatic spices include mustard, pepper, horse- 
radish, cayenne pepper, ginger, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, 
garlic, and onion. Their properties are derived from alkaloids and 
oils. The majority of physicians are in favour of their moderate 
use. They rouse a flagging appetite, promote the secretion of 
saliva and gastric juice, stimulate the movements of the stomach 
and bowels, and assist digestion in general. They are disinfectants 
and deodorants. They subdue irritability by producing a sensation 
of warmth, and prevent or relieve griping from various foods. 
They stimulate the visceral circulation, promote leucocytosis, and 
favour metabolism. Against abuse it is urged that excess causes 
hyperaemia of the liver, catarrh of the alimentary mucosa, haemor- 
rhoids, and interfere with nutrition. Korczynski found by experi- 
ment that they promote the motor functions of the stomach, but 
over-stimulate the secretory glands, and finally inhibit the formation 
of hydrochloric acid. Such spices should be forbidden in catarrh 
of the stomach and hypochlorhydria, but may be useful in hyper- 
chlorhydria. 

The sweet herbs mclude mint, thyme, sage, marjoram, savory, 
basil, bay-leaf, parsley, fennel, etc. Their flavour depends on 
tcrpenes and camphencs. They are soothing and carminative. 
They primarily constrict the arterioles; but they prevent griping,

relieve colic and flatulence. They are antiseptics. Many people 
cannot take them with impunity. They are too soothing, they 
chock the intestinal movements and circulation, interfere with 
pancreatic digestion, reduce absorption, and promote constipation. 
Menthol, which is a type of the bodies in sweet herbs, according to 
\'ladimirsky, diminishes the amount of free hydrochloric acid, 
hinders the transformation of proteins,- and checks the motor 
activity of the stomach. They should be avoided by persons having 
weak digestion, and forbidden to those with hypochlorhydria. But 
ordinar}^ persons may safely take them with meat, game, pork, 
veal, hsh, and other animal foods.

PART II 

CHAPTER IX 
DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

Indigestion. 

Indigestion is synonymous with dyspepsia, and signifies inter- 
rupted, delayed, laborious, or painful digestion of the food. It is 
a derangement of the processes which transform the food into 
chyme and chyle. With this meaning, indigestion is not confined 
to the stomach, but may affect the whole alimentary canal. The 
trouble, however, may be limited to one or another part of the canal 
— e.g., the stomach, the duodenum, or some other portion of the 
small bowel. The causes are various. It may be due to excessive 
consumption of food, eating too often, or fasting too long; food too 
rich and well seasoned or coarse and too little seasoned. It may 
arise from lingering over the pleasures of a luxurious table or from 
hurriedly eating the plainest fare; excessive imbibition of wine or 
need of stimulant; enmii in the wealthy or weariness in the toiler; 
inactivity or overwork; excess of joy and pleasure or grief; worry 
and mental depression; indulgence in too much sleep or too little 
sleep; overheated, badly ventilated rooms in luxurious homes or 
exposure to cold and damp or living in poor surroundings. 

Excessive consumption of foods and eating between meals over- 
taxes the alimentary organs. Hurried eating means improper 
mastication and deficiency of sahva; this is the beginning of trouble. 
When mastication is defective, not only is the saliva deficient, but 
there is a deficiency of gastric juice and especially of the psychic or 
appetite juice. If the psychic juice is deficient, there will be a 
deficiency of the hormone which provokes normal secretion of gastric 
juice; consequently the period of gastric digestion may be delayed 
an hour or two, and the imperfect!}' masticated material will cause 
pain, or distension by flatus will occur, and palpitation of the heart, 
shortness of breath, flushed face, and other symptoms. 

Irregular feeding is distinctively conducive to indigestion; one 
meal only is as bad as six or seven meals a day. Eating between 
meals prolongs the digestive process indefinitely; the alimentary 
organs are never at rest. 

Dyspepsia is frequently due to the constitution of the food. 

269 



270 DISEASES OE THE STOMACH 

New bread, hot cake, pyclot, crumpet, muffin, pastry, boiled dum- 
plings, boiled suet puddings, " rich " foods, fatty foods, highly 
seasoned dishes, entrees, hashed meat, curry, sausage, pork, pork 
pie, veal, liver, kidney, brain, salted or pickled meat, crab, lobster 
and other shellfish, cheese, coarse vegetables, uncooked vegetables, 
salads, pickles, sauces, sweet dishes, and confectionery are a prolific 
source of trouble. 

There can be no doubt of the deleterious effect resulting from 
the mixture of too many foods; but within moderate limits variety 
is beneficial, whereas monotony is detrimental. It should be added 
that one kind of food is not equally injurious to everybody; it is 
perfectly true that " one man's food is another man's poison." 
This is due to idiosyncrasy; a person who is upset by a teaspoonful 
of fresh egg might be able to eat cheese or pork pie with impunity. 
A moderate amount of veal or pork may cause serious indigestion 
in a man of forty; but a man of sixty-live or seventy years may 
not feel any ill-effect from it. Another person, who has heart- 
burn or acidity of the stomach after rice pudding, probably feels 
no ill-effect from apple pie and cheese. The excessive use of 
tobacco, alcohol, tea, spices, and condiments frequently causes 
indigestion. 

Acute Indigestion occurs, for example, when an individual con- 
sumes an excess of food, or there is a disproportion between the 
food consumed and the digestive capacity. The latter circumstance 
may arise from bodily exhaustion, mental distress, shock, or worry. 
It may be due to the consumption of unsuitable foods — lobster, 
salmon, mackerel, pickles, pastry, ices, etc. The offending sub- 
stance causes pain in the epigastrium, and sometimes vomiting or 
purging. When the symptoms are less acute, the pain may be 
accompanied by palpitation and irregularity of the heart, dyspnoea, 
flatulence, and restlessness. If the patient sleeps, he may talk or 
dream, and when he awakes he may have a disagreeable taste in 
his mouth, disinclination for food, and a headache. 

The obvious remed}' is an emetic. The pain usually ceases when 
the stomach is emptied. If vomiting does not occur naturally or 
after the emetic, give hot water frequently to encourage vomiting 
and cause expulsion of flatus; the addition of sodium bicarbonate 
or other antacid may be useful. Let the stomach rest from food 
for a few hours after it is cleared out ; then give a light meal of milk 
and soda-water, or lime-water, or Perrier water. A few hours later 
a cup of tea and some dry toast may be taken; and later on a light 
meal of sole, plaice, or boiled fowl, mashed potato, and a tapioca 
or sago pudding. Ordinary diet may usually be resumed within 
thirty-six or forty-eight hours after the attack commenced; but 
the patient should be carefully instructed about his diet and a 
diet-sheet given him. 

Chronic Indigestion, dyspepsia, or functional derangement of the 
stomacli, is due to one or more of the causes detailed above. 

The subject of chronic indigestion ought to have only three 



I 



INDIGESTION 271 

meals a day — at 8 a.m., 1.30, and 7 or S p.m. ; a cup of tea may be 
taken about five o'clock. A short rest should precede the midday 
and evening meals, and a longer rest follow them The interval 
between the meals must be at least live hours, and a longer time is 
advantageous in bad cases. Mastication must be well and carefully 
performed. " Fletcherism " might be useful in bad cases; but due 
application of the rule of Sir Andrew Clark is sufficient for most 
patients — " that the mouth contains, or ought to contain, thirty- 
two teeth indicates that every mouthful of food should receive 
thirty-two bites." When swallowed, the food should be fine enough 
to go through a sieve. Defective teeth must be repaired or replaced. 

If the indigestion is very severe, it may be necessary for a short 
time to allow the patient only soft foods — -s.g., milk diluted with an 
alkaline or gaseous water (lime, lithia, soda, or potash waters, 
Apollinaris, Perrier, Puralis, or Salutaris waters). After a day or 
two on milk the diet may be improved by adding peptonized milk, 
Benger's food, milk gruel, or other farinaceous food, boiled stale 
bread and milk, custard, junket, and jelly. When the stomach 
will bear these substances without pain or discomfort, the patient 
may have the food detailed for less severe cases. 

In less severe dyspepsia and in all cases while attention is being 
given to the teeth, the food must consist of articles which require 
very little mastication — stale bread (free from crust), biscuits or 
crackers (which will readily break down to powder in the mouth 
— e.g., Marie or cracknell) ; omelette; egg-snow and custard; raw 
eggs in milk, milk; soup, broth; consomme, scraped meat, pounded 
chicken, chicken panada or souffle; sole, plaice, whiting; mashed 
potato, vegetable puree, spinach, vegetable marrow; stewed fruit, 
cooked apples, milk puddings, baked custard, junket, and jelly. 
By-and-by the breakfast may consist of rusk or stale bread, lightly 
boiled or poached eggs or an omelette, and the midday meal may 
include a slice of underdone meat from a joint, the breast of a fowl, 
and other forms of fish, such as turbot, brill, cod, or young halibut. 
The evening meal should consist of similar articles. At breakfast 
some China tea or other tea containing a minimum of tannin may 
be taken. Water is the best beverage for lunch and dinner. A 
tumblerful of hot water, sipped slowly before the meal, cleanses 
the mucosa and refreshes it. When taken four or five hours after 
a meal, it hastens the final stages of gastric digestion, dispels flatus, 
and corrects acidity; a cupful of tea about 5 p.m. has the same effect. 

In ordinary indigestion or dyspepsia the food should be as follows: 
Bread a day or two old; it ought to be light and porous, crumble 
easily in the fingers, be readily penetrated by fluids, but should 
not form coherent masses when rubbed in the hands. New bread 
should never be eaten; it forms tough or putty-like masses which 
resist dissolution and digestion. 

Soup and broth of a proper kind may be taken, made from bones, 
beef, mutton, veal, chicken, rabbit, clam, or turtle. It should never 
be made from scraps of previously cooked meat, or from game which 



272 DISEASES OE THE STOMACH 

is '■ high." The materials must be fresh — i.e., free from taint of 
putrefaction. Consomm6 or puree is proper; in fact, the dyspeptic 
ought not to eat the vegetables boiled in broth or soup unless they 
are reduced to a pulp and put through a sieve. 

Fish of the lighter kinds is always permissible — sole, plaice, 
whiting, fresh haddock, turbot, brill, flounder, perch, bass, cod, 
weak-fish, and practically all fish containing less than 2 per cent, 
of fat. Fish containing a higher percentage of fat as a rule are 
more difficult to digest ; therefore herrings, bloaters, mackerel, eels, 
salmon, etc., must be avoided by the dyspeptic. Boiled whiting 
is the lightest fish ; its fibres are soft and disintegrate easily. The 
ordinary sauces must be forbidden, but some butter and a few 
drops of vinegar or lemon juice may be allowed. 

As a rule mutton is better than beef for the dvspcptic ; its muscular 
fibres are shorter and ought to digest quicker than those of beef 
of the same age. Many people prefer beef. Whichever is used 
must be tender, and every piece of gristle and skin should be cut 
out, because the stomach cannot digest such materials, and they give 
rise to pain and discomfort. It is not necessary for the meat to 
be consum.ed on the day after it is killed; putrefaction does not 
begin so soon. On the contrary, meat w'hich has been carefully 
stored for some days, while remaining free from putrefaction, 
becomes more tender and easier to digest through the action of 
lactic acid upon the sarcolemma of the fibres. The undercut of 
beef and the subscapular portion of mutton are particularly recom- 
mended. Tripe, sweetbread, boiled fowl, and rabbit are useful 
foods. Pheasant, guinea-fowl, breast of turkey, and grouse are 
better than partridge, hare, venison, and dark-fleshed game. 

Potatoes should be mashed, preferably by a wire masher. Carrots, 
turnips, swedes {yuta baga), skirret, salsify, and other roots should 
only be eaten in the form of puree. The same remark applies, as 
a general rule, to cabbage, savoy, Brussels sprouts, and kale; but 
spinach, caufiflower, young and tender spring cabbage, green peas, 
and kidney (string or snap) beans, and vegetable marrow (squash), 
ma\' be eaten in their ordinary form. While the indigestion is 
really bad, all fruits should be cooked ; when the dyspepsia is less 
severe, a few uncooked ripe strawberries, raspberries, cherries, 
grapes, oranges, a pear, or even a crisp and juicy apple, may be eaten. 

It should be again observed (see Digestibility of Foods) that 
root starches are digested more easily and leave a smaller residue 
than cereal starches, and that tapioca, sago, arrowroot, tous le mots, 
poie (taro), and potatoes are the best sources of carbohydrate for 
very severe cases of dyspepsia In less severe cases rice (which 
ranks next to them) may be taken. Wheat-flour, oatmeal, and 
barley-meal require a longer time for digestion; but during pro- 
longed cooking the starch granules are burst, the cellulose envelopes 
softened, and some of the starch is transformed to dextrin. An 
average dyspeptic person may have all kinds of milk puddings (rice, 
sago, tapioca, oatmeal, barley, or bread) , cornflour mould, arrow- 



INDIGESTIOX 273 

root, blanc-mange, or jelly, apple charlotte, custard, egg-snow, 
junket, and cooked apples, plums, prunes, etc. 

X'c'^etariaii Dietary for Dyspjpua —There are some cases which 
do not improve with ordinary dietary, and the reason is sometimes 
difficult to discover. Some of these dyspepsias owe their origin to 
gout or some central nervous trouble. They may do better when 
meat is abstained from entirelv for a few weeks; in fact, a course of 
vegetarian or purin-free diet may be essential. The proteins should 
be obtained from a puree of haricot beans, lentils, or chestnuts, 
but a pint or two or milk and one or two lightly boiled eggs may be 
taken daily. The rest of the food should consist of dry toast or 
bread-crust, oatmeal, pearl barley, maize-meal, macaroni, vermi- 
celli, spaghetti; butter; French vegetable soup; puree of turnips, 
carrots, and herbs used for making soup; kidney (string or snap) 
beans, green peas, spinach; and all kinds of cooked fruit. Care 
must be taken that the food is properly balanced; vegetarian diet 
IS practically of a low protein character. 

The Meal Cure.- The Salisbury treatment [q-v.) is also useful 
for gouty dyspeptics and others who are overburdened with fat, 
suffer from pain, aciditw and fermentation, by removing all fer- 
mentable carbohydrates and reducing the diet to the greatest 
simplicit}'- -;«^a/ and hot water. 

In all cases the excessi\'e use of tea, coffee, alcohol, and tobacco 
must be avoided. Tea taken at the same time as meat hinders its 
digestion; but a cup of tea or coffee three or four hours after a 
meal hastens the final stages of gastric digestion — hence the value 
of a cup or two of tea about 5 p.m. It is better to drink nothing 
at all while eating; let the food be well masticated and the saliva 
given an opportunity to work. The patient may drink about i pint 
of hot water a short time before each meal, or the same amount of 
cold water at the end of it. Bv the former method the mucous 
membrane will be washed and liberated from the residue of the 
previous meal; b}- the latter, flatus will be dispelled and thirst 
quenched. 

The use and abuse of alcohol has been considered under that 
heading (p. 250). A small quantity of sound wine or well-diluted 
spirit will be beneficial to many people; but an excess will hinder 
digestion. Bo'deaux or Burgundy wines, or pure malt whisky 
made in a pot-still, are the best. A glass of light ale, beer, or stout, 
may be beneficial by raising the appetite and stimulating the 
digestive secretions of a person fatigued by work. It is the abuse 
of such beverages the physician must constantly bear in mind; it 
causes degenerative changes in the gastric mucous membrane, 
hyperamia of the hver, secondary catarrh of the intestinal mucosa 
from passive congestion, and other sequela?. The section on alcohol 
should be read. 

Articles to be forbidden. — The patient should scrupulously avoid 
rich soups, gravies, and sauces. A small quantity of soup at the 
beginning of dinner stimulates the secretion of gastric juice, but a 

18 



274 DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

larger quantity would hinder digestion. He must also avoid veal, 
pork, sausage, duck, goose, forcemeat, liver, kidnej's; foods cooked 
in fat (fried foods); pickled and salted meat or fish; crab, lobster, 
shelllish; cheese; hot buttered toast, pyclets, muffins, crumpets, 
or other liot cakes, and new bread; pastry, boiled puddings, rich 
cakes, sweetened dishes, jam, candy, and other confectionery. 
Some reason is necessary for excluding many articles. 

Fat is not digested in the stomach, except that the cellular 
mtmbrancs are dissolved and the fat liberated. Gastric juice con- 
tains lipase, a fat-splitting enzyme; but Volhard says it only acts 
on fat in the form of an emulsion^r.g., egg-yolk, muk, cream. 
These foods rarely disagree when taken in moderation; but rich 
fatt}- foods cause indigestion in two ways: (i) Much fat checks the 
secretion of gastric juice and fa\ours bacterial fermentation; (2) it 
hinders digestion b}- preventing the access of gastric juice to the 
foods. In pastry, buttered toast, cake, crumpets, other rich 
carbohjdrate foods, pork, duck, goose, fat hshes, etc., the fat is 
intimateh- blended with the particles of flour or fibres of meat, and 
the gastric juice cannot get at the pioteins until the fat is dis- 
solved out; these foods, therefore, must pass into the intestines 
before they are digested, unless they remain in the stomach long 
enough for the removal of the fat which invests them. 

Salted, pickled, or dried meat, is less easily digested than unsalted 
meat. Salt and saltpetre harden the muscular fibres and prevent 
the gastric juice loosening their connections and digesting them. 
The collagen of connective tissues is usually converted by gastric 
juice into gelatoses and peptones. The gelatoses (proto- and deutero- 
gelatose), according to Chittenden, do not differ essentially from 
the digestion products of gelatin They are soluble, and easily 
pass out of the stomach; but when the fibres are inaccessible or 
harder than usual, the gastric juice cannot penetrate them, and 
digestion is hindered. Animal cell membranes, including sarco- 
lemma, resemble either elastin or keratin. When meat is young 
and tender, its cell coverings resemble elastin, which is soluble; 
when it is old and tough, these membranes become more or less 
like keratin, which is insoluble. Salt and saltpetre cause these 
membranes to become much more like keratin than elastin. Sugar 
is frequently mixed with salt to prevent this effect, and when 
meat is preserved with sugar only, its fibres remain softer and moister 
and easier digested than that preserved with salt and saltpetre. 

Cakes and other sweet foods are usually compounds of flour, 
eggs, sugar, butter, or other fat. They are highly nutritious, and 
many people can consume them regularly with impunity; but other 
people have heartburn, acidity, and other evidences of indigestion 
after eating them for a few days. One cause of indigestion has 
been referred to — viz., the flour is saturated with fat. The excess 
of sugar is another cause. Under ordinary circumstance's some 
portion of the cane-sugar is inverted to dextrose or maltose by 
gastric juice acting in the presence of mucin; but the frequent 



FORBIDDEN FOODS 275 

presence, or a temporary excess, of cane-sugar leads to a dispro- 
portionate secretion of mucus. This hinders digestion by envelop- 
mg the food and preventing the access of gastric juice. Aitchison 
Kobertson' showed that the power of the stomach to invert cane- 
sugar is diminished in chronic dyspepsia and other gastric troubles, 
and if a solution of cane-sugar is taken after washing out the 
stomach, it causes pain, heartburn, and flatulence; but a solution 
of invert-sugar does not cause these symptoms. This evidence 
conhrms clinical experience that dyspeptics ought to avoid sugar, 
jam, marmalade, syrups, sweet cakes, and other foods sweetened 
with sugar. On the other hand, honey, treacle (ijiolasses), maple- 
syrup, and other substances containing a large proportion of 
invert-sugar (dextrose, levulose, and maltose) are much less likely 
to cause pain, fiatulence, and acidity, and may be taken witli 
impunity by most dyspeptics. It should be pointed out that 
many saccharine fluids sold as golden syrup, amber syrup, or syrup, 
are merely concentrated solutions of cane-sugar, and only contain 
the smaU amount of invert-sugar which has been produced by heat 
during concentration. 

Vegetables. — The cell membranes of plants are not digested in 
the stomach; they consist of cellulose. When the cells are young, 
these membranes are thin, and the valuable juices, salts, and soluble 
carbohydrates are remDved by osmosis and diffusion. When they 
are cooked, such cells are burst by heat and expansion, the gastric 
juice obtains access to the interior, and the substances are digested; 
but as the cells increase in age, the cellulose covering gets thicker, 
the fibres more or less covered with lignin [Hgno-ceUiUose) , and the 
tissues are neither softened nor loosened by gastric juice ; they cause 
pain and discomfort, and, in common parlance, are indigestible. 
When such vegetables are boiled, the action of heat and water 
softens the cellulose and loosens the fibres to a considerable extent, 
but they are not nearly so easily digested as young vegetables, and 
they still cause pain and other symptoms of indigestion; therefore 
all dyspeptics must be forbidden to eat salads, pickles, uncooked 
vegetables, most uncooked fruits, and nuts. The cooked vegetables 
and fruits indicated above may be consumed; but cabbages, savoy, 
carrots, turnips, parsnips, celery, yams, sweet potatoes, and Jeru- 
salem artichokes must be forbidden or reduced to puree by rubbing 
the cooked vegetables through a sieve. 

Spices and Condiments. — The abuse of these substances is a 
well-known cause of indigestion. Their moderate consumption by 
ordinary people need not be interdicted. Certain people need the 
slight stimulation which results from their use. Mustard, pepper, 
ginger, cloves, allspice, horseradish, cayenne pepper, onions, and 
garlic have a dietetic value which should not be under-estimated; 
but this value is seldom taken into account. By their presence in 
food they excite the nerves of taste and smell, and cause a sensation 
of hunger, increase of appetite, and a desire for food. They stimulate

276 DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

the salivary and gastric secretions; the motor activity of the 
stomach is promoted; tliey subdue tlie irritabihty of the stomach 
and bowels, reheve dyspepsia, flatulence, hiccough, and even 
spasm or cramp of the stomach. The griping pain following the 
consumption of vegetables, such as cabbage, caulillower, peas, 
beans, artichokes, turnips, etc., is prevented or relieved, and in- 
testinal digestion is promoted. The sweet herbs- — mint, thyme, 
sage, marjoram, savory, and basil -have a different effect; they 
are antiseptic, carminative, soothing. They prevent griping or 
colic and relieve flatulence, but they depress glandular activity 
and slightly check the intestinal movements and absorption. 

These effects should be carefully considered when dieting a dys- 
peptic patient. A moderate use of the first group of spices will 
be useful to such a person b}' stimulating the circulation through 
the vessels of the stomach and bowels, promoting secretion, increas- 
ing muscular tone, dispelling flatus, checking bacterial fermenta- 
tion, and assisting absorption all through the alimentary canal; 
but their abuse is deleterious by overstimulation of the glands and 
causing catarrh, which ultimately results in failure of nutrition. 
Korczynski ' found that mustard, pepper, ginger, etc., stimulate 
digestion by promoting motor activity; but they progressively 
impair the glandular functions and Anally inhibit the secretion of 
hydrochloric acid. With regard to the second group, although 
they exercise valuable antiseptic, aromatic, and carminative proper- 
ties of great value when game and other foods of a high character 
are consumed, they depress the glandular secretions, and check 
intestinal movements and absorption. Moreover, the observations 
of Vladimirsky" on menthol— a good representative of the essential 
principles of this group of spices^ — showed that it diminished the 
proportion of free hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice; that lactic 
acid rises in proportion to such diminution; under its influence 
the digestion of proteins was delayed and the motor activity of the 
stomach lessened, although absorption was promoted by stimulation 
of the circulation. The conclusion to be derived from the observa- 
tion and clinical experience is that the second group (mint, thyme, 
sage, marjoram, basil, savory, bay-leaf, etc.) should be entirely 
prohibited to the dyspeptic person. 

An endeavour should be made, where a person has habitually 
abused spices and condiments, to break the habit. A sudden 
cessation of their use would be injurious. The habit must be 
gradually broken, and the diet carefully arranged until the stomach 
has regained its tone and vigour. 

lobacco, like man}' other things, is not injurious when used in 
moderation; but excessive smoking may derange the functions of 
the alimentary canal. Ihe secretions diminish, the peristaltic 
movements become slower and feebler, appetite fails, dyspepsia oi

GASTRIC IRRITATION 277 

gastric catarrh appears, and nutrition is impeded. Dyspeptics 
should not smoke cigars or cigarettes, and they should limit their 
smoking to 2 ounces of mild tobacco in a pipe weekly. 

Exercise in the open air is valuable to dyspeptics. The man of 
sedentary habits must exercise his body in some way. Walking is 
good; but most men prefer golf, bowls, tennis, quoits, croquet, 
badminton, shooting, or fishing. A tour in Derbyshire, Wales, 
West of Scotland, Switzerland, the Tyrol, the Rocky Mountains, 
and other mountainous districts is excellent for many men; but 
excess of exercise would be bad. There are some dyspeptics, 
sedentery people, whose heart is too soft and flabby to bear much 
walking or hill-climbing. A long sea-voyage would be preferable 
for them; if they are bad sailors, they may try the effect of a long 
motor tour. Rut they should be encouraged to take some exercise. 
Swedish movements or the Schott exercises and gentle walking on 
a low-grade incline must be insisted on when nothing else is suitable. 

A course of mineral waters would be useful. It may be taken 
at Bath, T,eamington, Malvern, or Harrogate in England; at Carls- 
bad, Marienbad, Kissingen, or Tarasp on the continent of Europe; 
at Bethesda Springs, Hot Springs (Arkansas), and other places in 
the United States of America; or Banff in the Canadian Rockies. 
Such waters cleanse the gastric mucosa, improve the circulation 
through the portal vessels, augment glandular activity, and remove 
the products of bacterial activity and faulty metabolism. Baths, 
combined with the Aix douche, massage, and galvanism would 
assist the cure. Some cases of chronic indigestion require months 
or years for complete recovery; but unless organic changes have 
occurred, the patient may be encouraged to hope for an ultimate 
recovery of good digestion and sound health. 

'Gastric Irritation. 

Various functional and organic conditions are included in in- 
digestion. The primary functional disorder of the stomach is 
gastric irritation. The food and food accessories bear the same 
relation to this disease as irritating gases and particles of matter 
inhaled into the lungs bear to bronchial catarrh or bronchitis. 
Gastric irritation includes gastric catarrh and what is usually de- 
scribed as " acid dyspepsia "; but the latter by no means includes 
all cases of gastric irritation, for. the motor function as well as the 
secretory may be disturbed. Martin^ considers there are two stages 
of the disorder: (i) In the first stage there is a varying degree of 
congestion and nervous irritability of the mucosa, increased and 
prolonged acidity of the gastric contents (hyperacidity), due chiefly 
to excess of hydrochloric acid (hvpcrcWorhydria), and a varying 
degree of weakness of the muscular walls [atony], which may lead 
to a moderate dilatation of the organ. (2) In the second stage of 
irritation there may be continued nervous irritability, but the

overworked organ shows a diniiiiution of function {gastnc tn^iuffi- 
cit'Hcy) cliaracterized by diminished secretion of gastric juice or 
hydrochloric acid {hypoch'orhydria), and greatly diminished motor 
activity (myasthenia), causing a delay in the passage of food through 
the pylorus, and terminating in dilatation of the viscus. Cam- 
panella classifies the symptoms which may arise from gastric irrita- 
tion thus: (i) Chemical: hyperchlorhydria, hypochlorhydria, 
achlorhydria, and organic hyperacidity; (2) sensory: gastralgia, 
hyperaesthesia, anaesthesia, nausea, and abnormadity of appetite — ■ 
e.g., anorexia; (3) ncnyo-motor : vomiting, pyrosis, spasm, cramp, 
atony, and motor insufficiency. Many of these functional disorders 
require treatment on special lines; therefore, when chronic indiges- 
tion is very persistent, an attempt should be made by test-meals 
and chemical reagents to ascertain the exact functional disorder. 
By these means the acidity and activity of the gastric juice may be 
tested, the motility or motor power of the stomach gauged, and 
also its power of absorption. The reader is referred to other works 
for these tests. The conditions are dealt with below. 

Hyperchlorhydria. — This is a form of acid dyspepsia which 
affects half the dyspeptics between the ages of twenty and forty- 
five years. It is more common in men than women, especially 
in the strenuous man of business, the shopkeeper who works many 
hours, the hard-working student, the person who worries or suffers 
from anxiety. It is common in those who eat too rapidly or con- 
sume an excess of spices, alcohol, or tobacco. It is sometimes 
associated with chlorosis, ulcer of the stomach or duodenum, 
P3'loric spasm, gastric dilatation, or gastroptosis. The local irrita- 
ting effect of alcohol causes hypersecretion of the gastric juice, and 
especially of the hydrochloric acid. When long continued, the 
irritation causes gastric catarrh Spices produce the same effect 
as alcohol; but it is lessened when the spice is mixed with a large 
amount of food. Tea, especially those kinds containing much 
tannin, also irritates the mucous membrane and causes hyper- 
acidity. Organic acids, although very valuable to the organism, 
often irritate the gastric mucosa and cause hyperacidity. Fruit 
and vegetables containing malic, citric, and tartaric acid are irrita- 
ting; but these containing oxahc acid are more so. Hvperacidity 
may be due to nervous causes: grief, worr^-, anxiety. Martin^ says: 
" The results of irritation of a living tissue depend not only on the 
strength of the irritant, but on the condition of the nervous system. 
A slight irritation of the nervous s} stem is followed by large effects. 
In gastric disorders the hyperacidity may be due to the direct effect 
of local irritation or indirect effect through a disorder of the nervous 
mechanism, exaggerated examples being seen in neuroses of the 
stomach." 

Hyperchlorhydria cannot be diagnosed by subjective signs; a 
test dinner and examination of the gastric contents is necessary. 
In this disease the gastric juice is abnormally free and strong; free

HYrF.RCllLOKIIYDIilA 279 

HCl begins to appear in ten minutes after a meal, and is excessive. 
What degree of acidity constitutes hyperclilorhydria is not easily 
answered. Tlie acidity of normal gastric juice at the height of diges- 
tion varies from 40 to 60 degrees on Ewald's scale. A total acidity 
of more than 70. and free HCl of more than 50, give rise to symp- 
toms of hyperclilorhydria. The hyperacidity is due to HCl and not 
to organic acids; the HCl may rise to o\5 or even 06 per cent, and 
cause an acidity of 70 to 100 degrees on Ewald's scale. The patient 
has a good npj^ctite, perfect digestion of protein foods, the stomach 
is empty when fasting, and there is no motor impairment as the 
meal passes out in the usual time. Meat, lish, fowl, eggs, and milk 
are digested quickly, and their presence gives temporary relief to 
the symptoms. Foods containing much starch digest slowly. 
When the stomach is emptied after a test dinner, the contents con- 
sist almost entirely of residues from farinaceous foods, as seen by 
the microscope and tests for starch. Of course, the presence of 
e^g, milk, meat, or fish residues depends on the time which has 
elapsed since the consumption of the meal. Starch digestion is 
checked when the acidit\- rises to 012 per cent., and there may 
be some delay in emptying the stomach owing to pyloric spasm, 
due in turn to excess of starchy food. 

As a general rule the patient has perfect comfort during the meal 
and for some time afterwards; but at the end of an hour or two 
there is discomfort on pressure in the epigastrium, more or less 
severe pain, heartburn, pyrosis, eructations of gas, and there may 
be headache, giddiness, vertigo, or palpitation, or a combination 
of them. It is relieved by taking a glass of milk or raw eggs to 
fix the acid, or sodium bicarbonate and waters containing it (Apol- 
linaris, Vichy, etc.) to neutrahze acid and check its secretion. 
The prognosis of primary hyperchlorhydria is good. When it is 
secondary to gastric or duodenal ulcer or organic change, the treat- 
ment and prognosis is that of the causative disease. Boas says it 
is not easy to decide whether the symptoms are due to functional 
derangement or organic change in the mucosa. The hyperacidity 
may be the initial stage of chronic glandular gastritis. The exis- 
tence of disturbance of the motor power, the presence of an excess 
of mucus in materials removed from the stomach, and a history of 
the abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and spices, is in favour of the dis- 
order being due to organic changes. 

Treatment.- Wcmmeiiix considers hyperchlorhydria is caused by 
the consumption of too much animal food, and the hyperacidity is 
an adaptation of natural means called forth by the frequent presence 
of an excess of protein foods. This is not true of all cases, for it is 
quite common in the poor, whose diet is of a low protein standard. 
There is little doubt that it is associated with imperfect mastication 
or bolting the food, or hurried eating followed by active movements, 
by habitual over-eating, indulgence in an excess of alcohol, tobacco, 
spices, tea, etc. The first thing to do, therefore, is to regulate the 
life and habits of the patient. Insist upon regular hours for taking 



28o DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

food, of catinp; slowly, masticating thoroiij:::h]y, of r<^p;ulatinf^ the 
tomporaturo of food and drink; avoidinj; ices, fluids at too hif^h a 
temperature, soups, meat extracts, spices, and all excess in eating 
and drinking, especially alcohol, tobacco, spices, tea. and coffee. 
Rush and hurry must be avoided; the overwrovight must seek rest 
and change of air, and at the very least must rest for a short time 
after meals, and take out-of-door exercise. 

There is a difference of opinion as to the form of diet most suit- 
able for hyperchlorhydria. Some authorities consider nitrogenous 
food, and others carbohydrate, is the most suitable. In deciding the 
matter we should take into account the physiological effects of food 
in the stomach. Milk, bread, and other starchy foods cause but 
a small secretion of gastric juice; soups, meat extracts, fish, meat, 
and poultry cause a large secretion of gastric juice; fat and fatty 
foods tend to check the secretion of hydrochloric acid. Pawlow 
says the chemical excitants of gastric juice include water, substances 
in meat, meat extract, and milk. Fats have a retarding influence 
on the secretion, diminisli the quantity of the juice, and the amount 
of the enzyme. Alcohol is a powerful provocative of secretion. 
When the influence of meat, milk, and bread is compared, it is 
found — 

1. That the acidity is greatest with meat and lowest with bread. 

2. The duration of the secretion and quantity of the enzyme is 
greatest with bread and lowest with meat. 

3. That fats delay the appearance of the secretion, diminish the 
amount of the juice and the enzymes. According to Pawlow, even 
the presence of fat in the intestines has a reflex inhibitoiy influence 
upon gastric digestion.* 

These observations are to some extent borne out by clinical 
experience. Carbohydrate foods arc well tolerated if given in a 
suitable form, properly prepared, and carefully masticated. The 
indication, therefore, is to give an increased amount of amylaceous 
foods, which will be easily digested and assimilated, together with 
fats, especially butter and others which have a low melting-point, 
and are free from undesirable fatty acids, in such proportion as 
can be borne. Boas" agrees with the prescription of a fat and carbo- 
hydrate diet; but Strauss and Aldor' believe that the problem will 
be better solved by rcduci^tg /he atnonnl of ceirhohydratcs, while pro- 
viding in other ways a sufficiencv of non-nitrogenous foods. The 
replacement of amylaceous foods by carbohydrates in solution 
would not satisfv the requirements; but Strauss maintains that 
the desired end is to be obtained by increasing the amount of fat 
in the food. He undertook a series of investigations on cases of 
hvperchlorhvdria, by which means he showed tliat the addition of 
oil to the dietary was followed by a diminution of the total acidity 
and especially of the free HCl. Now, an excess of fat is known to

HYPERCIILORHYDRIA 281 

impair tfic motor power and absorptive faculty of tlie stomach; 
but, on the other hand, it supphes the patient with an abundance 
of heat and ener^jy-producing material which would otherwise be 
supplied with ditliculty. Strauss and Aldor claim to have estab- 
lislied the fact that in hyperchlorhydria there is a considerable 
tolerance of fatty substances, that the addition of 120 to 160 grammes 
of fat to the dietary is followed by no unpleasant symptoms; but, 
on the other hand, the nutrition and weight of the patient is im- 
proved. In their practice the additional f:ct was given in the form 
of milk, butter, cream, and oil. cream being especially recommended. 
Boas says lactic and butyric acids are well borne by such patients, 
and milk, cream, buttermilk, and kephir usually give rise to no un- 
pleasant symptoms, and may form a considerable part of the dietary. 

The propriety of giving a diet consisting largely of meat has been 
debated quite as freely as that of starch. Some authorities feed 
their patients almost entirely with animal foods and forbid starchy 
foods, the Salisbury diet being sometimes prescribed for six or eight 
weeks. The}' argue that the action of the salivary ferments is 
checked as soon as the food reaches the stomach, that intestinal 
digestion is defective, and therefore amylaceous foods are of little 
use to the organism. On the other hand, meat and other albu- 
minous foods speedily absorb the gastric juice, fix the free HCl, 
and prevent or diminish pain and irritation. But if we continue 
to give protein foods in a supernormal amount, it is plain, although 
the free HCl is absorbed and fixed, that the hypersecretion will be 
encouraged, as Herschell says, by the law that Nature, when able 
to do so, responds to the demands made upon her. This continued 
call for HCl to combine with the albuminous material upon which 
we are feeding the patient will certainly tend to hypertrophy of 
the glandular elements of the gastric mucosa, and the last state of 
the stomach will be worse than the first. It is therefore probable, 
Herschell^ says, that the disease will be perpetuated by a protein 
diet, and the alternative consists in the administration of a carbo- 
hydrate diet, consisting of substances partly dextrinized, at the 
same time neutralizing the greater part of the hyperacidity by drugs. 
Hutchison agrees that we must give a diet which will not lead to 
excessive secretion. However, he says that in the majority of 
cases it will be better to give such articles of food as will best tend 
to neutralize the acidity, and that the best regimen will be that 
in which milk, eggs. meat, and fish enter freely, whilst the starchy 
foods are kept within strict limits. 

Hummo'- says the aim of treatment is to regulate diet, neutralize 
excess of acid, and diminish oversecretion. I^'ood should be taken 
at short intervals, well and carefully masticated, and of a non- 
irritating character; there should be a rest of one hour at least after 
racii meal. Spices, aromatics. and excess of salt should be avoided. 
Drink should b(^ insipid and not often changed, thereby avoiding

2R2 DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

any psychic stimulation of the stomach. Much can be said for both 
the frotein and Ihr carbohydrate diets ; but the decision as to which 
should be used depends upon whether the hyperchlorhydria is 
t( ni]iorary or more or less permanent, whether acute or chronic, 
wliether there is greatly impaired motility, or a more or less per 
manent gastrorrh(ea. No general law can be laid dozen, each case 
must be decided on its own merits, and each article of the dietary 
must be settled by reference to them. Meat, meat extracts, soup, 
alcohol, tea, and coffee are all powerful stimulants of HCl secretion; 
milk, eggs, white flesh, bread, and rice have a much less powerful 
effect on the secretion of HCl. A diet whicli is mainly albuminoid is 
well tolerated in acute and painful cases; but such a diet should be 
considered as one of urgency only, and should not be long continued. 
Fatty substances should be avoided in acute cases. The following 
is a dietary prescribed by Wegele: 

Morning. — Two soft-boiled eggs; Aleuronat toast; tea and milk, 
i<>o grammes. 

Forenoon. — Raw ham, loo grammes; oatmeal broth, 250 grammes, or 
Aleuronat meal broth, 200 grammes; cream. 50 grammes. 

Noon. — Beef -steak, 150 grammes; mashed pota,to, 200 grammes; Aleuronat 
toast ; white wine, 100 grammes, with Vichy, Bilin, or Saratoga water. 

Afternoon. — Tea, 100 grammes ; cream, 15c) grammes. 

Evening. — Cold meat, 50 grammes; two scrambled eggs; Aleuronat toast; 
wine, 100 grammes. 

10 p.m. — Milk, 100 grammes. 

Total Aleuronat toast, 100 grammes a day. Total value of diet, 
2,400 calorics. 

I have not found it necessary in the majority of cases to give 
an absolute protein diet; indeed, I have had cases which only got 
better when meat and other animal foods were for a time stopped 
altogether, the carbohydrates and fats being correspondingly in- 
creased. The carbohydrates must be of such a character that they 
will be easily digested: good stale bread, milk puddings, blanc- 
mange, custards, oatmeal porridge, etc. Sweet foods are forbidden 
by most authorities, because thev increase the total acidity; but 
whereas sweet cooked foods, cakes, etc., may give rise to severe 
heartburn, acidity, and pain, it is seldom that dextrose and maltose, 
when taken with other food, give rise to such symptoms. As a 
general rule, boiled eggs, boiled fat bacon or ham, tender meat, 
poultry, or fish are the best animal foods; but milk, junket, kephir 
or yaourte, cream, and buttermilk are permissible. Olive-oil can 
be taken freely with salads; butter should also be consumed freely. 
The fat checks the secretion of HCl and helps to nourish the body. 
Milk is usually agreeable to the stomach, and the organ is spared 
by it more than by any other protein food; indeed, an absolute 
milk diet with rest in bed is not an unsuitable beginning of treat- 
ment for bad cases. Max Einhorn says milk and boiled eggs should 
predominate in the treatment of such cases, although he allows 
enough bread to bring up the diet to proper calorie value, the bread 
being thickly spread with butter. 



HYPERCHLOIillYDTilA 283 

A cuiitrcjversv occurred over tin- number of meals su( h patients 
should taki' daily. Some physicians arj^'ue that two or three meals 
a day should be taken with an interval (jf live or six hours between 
each, eating between meals being interdicted. Others prescribe 
frequent small meals, the object being to diminish the acidity of 
the stcjmach by the addition oi more fotxl when gastric digestion 
is at its height ; hence about six small meals daily, at about two and 
a half hours apart, meets tiiis view, which is app uently that in 
most favour. With this object the toUowing dietary is prescribed 
by Hawkins;* 

8 a.m. — Hot water, 8 ounces, with a small d(se of Carlsbad salts. 

8.30 a.m. — Cocoa made with !<■ ounces of milk, or the same amount tea 
(iialf milk); one or two eggs cooked any way; 2 ounces of Graham or whole- 
meal bread toasted, J ounce of butter, \ ounce of honey. 

II a.m. — Milk, 6 ounces ; soda-water, i ounce. 

I p.m. — Meat. 2 ounces (veal, mutton, or ham by preference, or hsh, .game, 
chicken, sweetbread, or savoury omelette); toast, i ounce; butter. \ ounce; 
custard or milk pudding. 2 ounces; cheese, J ounce; milk, 6 ounces, or plain 
or aerated water. 

5 p.m. — Milk, 6 ounces ; soda-water, i ounce ; toast or rusk, i ounce. 

7 p.m. — Milk soup, 6 ounces (flavoured with onion, celery, or turnips); 
meat or fish, 2 ounces (as at lunch); i otato puree or lentils, i ounce; milk 
pudding, blanc-mange, cu.stard or jelly, 2 ounces; toast, butter, and cheese or 
cheese-straws, as at lunch. Milk and soda, 6 ounces, or plain or aerated 
water. 

10.30 p.m. — Milk and soda, 6 ounces. 

Hawkins discusses the relative advantages of a protein diet and 
a carbohydrate diet. He says: " Protein food will relieve the dis- 
comfort which is the main feature of the malady, so that it would 
appear ob\ious at lirst sight that the diet should be mainly protein. 
. . . On the other hand, protein is a far greater stimulant of gastric 
secretion than carbohydrate food ... so that by persisting in a 
protein diet we relieve the svmptoms but perpetuate the malady. 
It is clear, therefore, that an amylaceous diet has a curative aim, 
while a protein diet is directed to the relief of symptoms." In 
severe cases of long standing he advises a " rest cure " of two or 
three weeks' duration. In the first week he allows i\ to 2 pints of 
milk daily and nothing more. In the second week he adds to the 
dietary one or two eggs, poached, boiled, or scrambled, and towards 
the end of the week 4 ounces of milk pudding or rusks, bringing 
up the energy value of the food to 1.500 or 1,600 calories a day. 
In the third week he allows the patient to get up. The diet consists 
of 2 pints of milk, two or three eggs, 4 ounces of fish (sole, plaice, 
or whiting) or chicken, 3 or 4 ounces of toast or rusk, butter, custard, 
jelly, or blanc-mange, and cream. It may be necessary to con- 
tinue this diet for some time: but as the gastric secretion returns to 
its normal limits the diet may be tentatively altered and extended. 
Starch, however, must continr.e to be dextrinized by dry heat, as 
in thin toast, rusks, crackers zwiebach, or gelatinized by moist 
heat, as in milk puddings. Sugar may be freely used, preferably 

^ Sutherland's " System of Dietetics," pp. 506-515. 



2v^4 DISEASES OF. THE STOMACH 

as honey or dextrose. Milk, junket, cream arc proper foods; 
cheese straws and prated cheese are permissible. Ef^jgs cooked in 
any manner are good. Butter is useful, as previously indicated. 
Jelly, calves'-foot jelly, cow-heel, and all gelatinous substances are 
proper foods. Tea (half milk), cocoa, milk and soda, plain water 
Perrier. Apollinaris, and other table waters are the best beverages. 
The food should be taken warm when possible, not hot; about 
100° F. Ices and very cold foods should be avoided. 

The patient should be forbidden to take alcohol entirely until 
cured. Coffee should be avoided. Soups also should be avoided, 
primarily because they stimulate gastric secretion, and secondarily 
because of their low nutritive value. Pastry and cakes are taboo. 
Condiments and spices are forbidden for reasons previously stated, 
especially mustard, pepper, cayenne, horseradish, ginger, curry, 
vinegar, pickles, and sauces. The effect of salt has been much 
discussed. Hemmeter reduced the acidity of gastric juice in dogs 
by feeding them on meat deprived of salts by boiling it in distilled 
water. In a similar manner Cahn so far reduced the proportion 
of chlorides in the blood that the gastric juice secreted was a neutral 
and inactive fluid. The experiments show that pepsin is dependent 
on the presence of HCl, and the secretion of HCl on the existence of 
chlorides in the blood. It is rational, therefore, to restrict the 
consumption of salt by persons suffering from hyperchlorhydria, 
and in severe cases to order salt-free diet. 

Raw fruits and vegetables must be forbidden, as well as cooked 
fruit containing seeds and vegetables having much cellulose. 

The patient may have to exercise care in the choice of foods for 
a long time. Alcohol must not be taken until the cure is complete, 
but when there is no return of the symptoms, a little lager beer or 
dinner ale, diluted hock, moselle, or claret, or even a small amount 
of well-diluted whisky, may be allowed. 

Hypochlorhydria.- — There is a diminution in the amount of 
cnmbined and free hydrochloric acid; the gastric juice is poor in 
quality. It is common in elderly persons with atonic dyspepsia 
or gastric catarrh; in others suffering from anaemia or general de- 
bility: and "weak digestion" may occur even in children, from 
a functional disorder characterized by a failure of the secretory 
and motor functions of the stomach. The condition varies from a 
slight diminution, or hypochlorhydria, to a complete cessation of the 
secretion of hydrochloric acid — achlorh\dria or achylia. The 
digestion of food in the stomach is delayed or almost suspended; 
various forms of fermentation occur; the appetite is poor; the taste 
is often bitter, but may be unchanged; the tongue, usually coated, 
may be quite clean, or large, flabby, and marked on the edges by 
the teeth; the breath may be sweet or foul; a sense of fulness or 
flatulent distension follows eating, with eructations of gas or sour 
rancid liquid; there may be vomiting or entire freedom from 
nausea; diarrhoea ma}- occur frequently, or there may be constipa- 
tion. 



UVPOCHl.ORHYDRIA 285 

Diminution of HCi plays a more important part in disordered 
digestion tiian excess ot acid. There are three main causes: 
(i) Long-continued irregularities in the quantity or quality of foji; 
(2j changes jn the stomach: chronic hypenemia, catarrh, airopliy 
of the glandular elements; (jj changes in the blood or nervous 
system. In acute catarrh ot the stomach the secretion of gastric 
juice is almost nil, and during recovery pepsin may reappear before 
the acid. In infectious diseases HCI smks to o ooO per cent., lactic 
acid rising in proportion. Tne HCI is usually lo\V in cases of active 
tuberculosis. In amemia it is deficient if there is chronic indigestio.i, 
but in chlorosis it is often excessive. There is a marked diminu- 
tion of HCI in cancer, i^ut the most important cause of hypochlor- 
hydria is chronic catarrh of the stomach. 

The deficiency of HCI reduces the antiseptic power of the gastric 
juice, and various bacteria flourish. After the consumption of 
carbohydrates, according t«j Nothnagel,' a small amount of lactic 
and butyric acids normally occur; but in pathological conditions — 
e.g., chronic gastric catarrh -the diminution of free HCI alters the 
reaction of the contents of the stomach, and all sorts of bacteria 
grow abundantly. The chief products are lactic and butyric acids; 
alcohol is also produced by yeast fungi and other bacteria, and 
in turn the alcohol is oxidized into acetic acid. 

In a bacteriological examination of gastric contents obtained from 
thirty healthy persons by Capitan and Moreau,^ only three kinds 
of micro-organisms were found -two being moulds and the other 
a bacillus. (Jn the other hand, Abelous^ obtained sixteen different 
micro-organisms from his own stomach: Sarcina ventricuii, BuciUus 
pyucyumus, Bacterium laclis aerogenes (Escherich), BuciUiis s-ublilis, 
B. tnycoidcs, B. ambylacley, \'ibrio rugula, besides eight other 
bacillary forms and one coccus. He investigated their action on 
foodstuffs. Casein was peptonized without coagulation by four 
kinds; nine kinds coagulated milk and dissolved the curd; four 
others coagulated milk but did not dissolve it. .Many of the micro- 
organisms affected carbohydrates, including starch, cane-sugar, 
glucose, and lactose. The total result of such micro-organisms is 
acid fermentation, alcoholic fermentation, and putrefaction. 

The antiseptic action of free HCI is therefore a necessity for 
healthy digestion. The amount normally present is 02 to 03 per 
cent., or 25 to 3'5 grammes per litre of gastric juice. In this pro- 
portion Miguel found free HCi will prevent putrefaction in bouillon, 
and Sieber found 0-5 per cent of free HCI added to 50 grammes of 
finely chopped meat prevented putrefaction until the seventh day. 
But some of the above-mentioned micro-organisms were found by 
Abelous to resist the action of HCI (0 17 per cent.) for a long time, 
especially when they contained spores; and Macfadyen sfiowed 
Staphylococcus aureus. Micrococcus tetragenus, and spores, readily 
pass through the stomach even during health.

286 DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

As a consequence of the deficiency of hydrochloric acid, protein 
indigestion in the stomach is very marked: but starch is very well 
digested in the stomach because the absence of free acid allows 
longiT time for the action of ptyalin. Moreover, there may be 
motor insufliciency, and the food is not properly mingled with the 
gastric secretion. When HCl is less, lactic acid is more abundant; 
butyric acid, and, later on, acetic acid, carbonic acid, hydrogen, and 
other gases are then formed. 

In the treatment of such cases the use of ferments and pre- 
digested foods has to be considered. The salivary ferment is not 
deficient, but attendant circumstances may prevent its carrying 
out its work; thus, imperfect mastication or defects in the teeth 
may cause an insufftcient secretion of saliva. In such cases the 
use of malt diastase, malt extract, or taka-diastase is justifiable to 
assist in the digestion of carbohydrates. If the free HCI is deficient, 
it is useless to give pepsin; but the administration of hydrochloric 
acid may be useful. Respecting the administration of peptonized 
foods, peptones, or albumoses, it is superfluous to give them if the 
motor power of the stomach is good; if the motor power is deficient, 
they are useless, because Cahn has shown that practically no pep- 
tone is absorbed from the stomach. Pancreatin, useless as a rule 
because it is destroyed by the gastric juice, may be of service in 
cases of complete achylia. 

The dietetic treatment consists, so long as the motor power is 
not defective, in the administration of carbohydrates and such 
proteins as will readily and quickly pass through the pylorus 
Milk, eggs, meat reduced to a pulp and in small amount, the 
lighter kinds of fish, milk puddings, custard, junket, jelly, and stale 
bread, should form the staple articles. A dietary similar to the 
following may be useful: 

Break jast. — T%vo eggs (liglilly bcdied or joachtd), or 5 ounces of tish (sole, 
j.laice, whiting, fresh haddock, biill, turbot, brook trout, bream, etc.), stale 
bread, dry toast, zwiebach ; ~ ounces of milk, weak tea, or cocoa. 

Lunch. — Soup; chicken, boiled mutton, or ham, 4 ounces; potato, spinach, 
vegetable marrow; milk pudding, custard, junket, jelly. 

Dinner. — Soup; fish (any light vaiiety), cliicken, pheasant, breast of turkey, 
iiibbit, lean mutton, undeidone beef; potato jjuree, spinach, vegetable 
marrow; puree of jarsnip, turnip, svedes (ruia baga); dry toast or zwiebach, 
sweets (as at lunch); dessert: a lew grapes, a tangerine orange, one plum tr 
apricot, etc. Bordeaux or otl.er light red wine. 

The food should be well salted to promote the secretion of HCl. 
A little soup at the beginning of lunch and dinner stimulates gastric 
secretion and assists in overcoming the hypochlorhydria; but, 
excepting a glass of red wine, the patient siiould take no other 
drink at these meals lest he dilute the already weak gastric juice. 
It is a good dietetic rule never to drink while eating, and only to 
take liquids a couple of hours after the meal, when thirst is actually 
felt. At this time, the gastric functions may be stimulated by 
drinking a cup of soup, meat extract, or some weak spirit and water. 
No solid food should be taken after dinner (7 p.m.). Mastication 
must be carefully performed, Clark's rule of masticating each mouth- 



iivrociii.oun vniaA 287 

fill thirty-two tiiiK-s being pnjpcrly observed, or " Fletcherism " may 
be ad(jj)ted. Butter, excess of fat meat, and all greasy or rich f(jod 
must be avoided, (ireen vegetables must b^ eaten sparingly, and 
all except spinach and vegetable marrow must be taken m tliu 
form of puree or consomme; coarse vegetables must be avoided. 
Spices and condiments may have a temporary beneficial effect, but 
are not recommended; pickles and heating sauces are forbidden 
(see Indigestion). 

Tlie hypochlorhydria may, however, resist a general dietary 
such as indicated above. Tiie inadequate glandular secretion may 
be attended by defective motility, in such cases the patient 
should be conhned to bed for two or three weeks and put on a milk 
diet. Robin objects to this method of treatment He says: 
" VVe must discard milk; it diminishes the gastric and biliary 
secretions, causes constipation, induces intestinal paresis, ami 
predisposes to irregular fermantations, which are particularly fre- 
quent in this kind of dyspepsia." But Hayem says milk is the 
most suitable food for all kinds of dyspepsia; it entails a minimum 
of expenditure, and is essentially unirritating; it is indicated in 
hyperpepsia (hyperchlorhydria) in which there is excessive stimula- 
tion, and in hypopepsia (hypochlorhydria), in which there is slow, 
laboured peptonization; it is better utihzed than any food, in 
cases of hypochlorhydria which resist other forms of dietary it 
should certainly be tried. The patient should be confined to bed. 
The quantity of milk should be 2 or 2^ pints, gradually increased 
to 6 or 7 pints a day. It is usually borne well, except in cases of 
extreme dilatation and complete lo.^s of motility or stasis. It may 
be given in^doses of a tumblerful every hour, or i pint every three 
hours, according to the patient's choice. It should be given raw, 
boiled, or baked, and pure, or mixed with lime-water, salt, celery 
salt, meat extract, or an alkaline gaseous water; some patients 
prefer skim milk. The draw^backs trom milk may be pain, flatu- 
lence, constipation, or diarrluea. Pain is often due to the forma- 
tion of curds; it may be prevented by lime or alkaline water, or 
sodium citrate. Flatulence is due to fermentation, for which 
various drugs may be required. If tolerance of milk is not estab- 
lished, we may resort to the use of kephir, yaourte, and other fer- 
mented forms of milk. The presence of the ferments and lactic 
acid assist in its digestion, and the lactic acid stimulates pancreatic 
secretion (Pawlow). Acccjrding to Lyon, kephir does not remain in 
the stomach so long as milk, it is usually given with sugar or with 
seltzer-water. A combination of milk and kepiiir is usetul in pro- 
moting tolerance and assisting to maintain the strength of the 
patient; but a milk or milk and kephir diet cannot be other than a 
temporary regimen, and more nourishing sustenance soon becomes 
indispensable. After two weeks on the diet we may add to it 
four or hve lightly cooked or raw eggs. Thus, breakfast may 
consist of I pint of milk; lunch, of i| pints of milk and two eggs; 
tea, I pint of milk; supper, li pints of milk and two eggs. The 
duration of this diet will vary with the progress of the case, and the 



-S8 DISEASES 01' THE STOMACH 

patient must ultimately be put upon the regimen first detailed. 
That dii'tar}' will have to be continued, modihed, or suspended 
according to the progress of the patient. Should it fail, a lacto- 
vegetarian diet may be tried, or a course of treatment may be 
taken at \'ichy, Fouges, Carlsbad, or Marienbad. 

Organic Acidity.- -The cause is simple when it is due to the 
presLiicf ul acids in the food — ^.i,'., vinegar, pickles, salads, cider, 
perry, acid wines, etc. Ordinary diet does not usually contain 
enough acids to irritate the stomach, but various causes lead to 
food containing an excess. Butter contains 7 or 8 per cent, of 
volatile acids, chief of which is butyric acid. Fresh meat contains 
o 05 to 0075 per cent, of lactic acid, but smoked meat may have 
075 per cent. Fresh pork contains about 037 per cent., but sausages 
may have 075 to ot^^ per cent. Ordinary wheaten bread contains 
little acid, but sour bread contains a variable amount of acetic, 
lactic, and butyric acids. Green vegetables and fruit contain an 
abundance of organic acids and their salts, which frequently cause 
gastric irritation. Long-continued irritation by acid foods causes 
chronic gastric catarrh. The cause of acidity may be chemical- - 
e.g., transformation of alcohol into acetic acid — or fungoid, from 
the presence of Aspergillus, Penicilium, or other fungi in the 
stomach; and bacterial, from the presence of micro-organisms. 
The acids commonly produced in the stomach are lactic, butyric, 
acetic, and carbonic. When tlie gastric juice contains a due pro- 
portion of free HCl, it checks bacterial activity and prevents the 
lormation of acids. The presence of lactic acid in normal gastric 
juice has not been proved; but when free HCl sinks below tlie 
proper percentage, lactic acid is always present. TJiis does not 
come from the gastric glands, as it does in infancy, but arises from 
the unrestrained action of bacteria and fungi on carbohydrates. 
One molecule of dextiose is transformed into two molecules of 
lactic acid, and a molecule of lactose or cane-sugar into four mole- 
cules of lactic acid. Butyric acid originates from lactic acid, 
dextrose, or other sugar. 1 he presence oi such acids in the stomach 
causes lieartburn, pyrosis, regurgitation of food, flatulent distension, 
cramp, spasm, palpitation of the heart, shortness of breath, and 
sometimes vomiting. If the acidity is fungoid, the vomit may be 
ltd or green, giving an appearance of blood or bile. If the acidity 
persists, it will cause gastric catarrh, and may lead to dilatation. 

Treatment. — Organic acidity may be temporarily relieved by 
drinking water to dilute the acids at the time when gastric digestion 
is at its height; also by the administration of alkalies and alkaline 
waters. Free acids may thus be neutralized; but fermentation 
proceeds more rapidly than in their absence, be'cause the growth 
of bacteria is favoured by an alkaline medium. The proper course 
is to rest the stomach by abstinence from food, until it has had 
time to become empty. A milk diet for a day or two is then useful. 
Alltivaids the diet must le restricted to meat, fish, eggs, and green 
\egetables, all farinaceous foods and even bread being banished for a 



ORGANIC ACIDITY 289 

linic. After a carbohydrate-free diet has been used for a sufhcient 
period, a gradual return to mixed diet must be made by allowing a 
small amount of easily digestible carbohydrate materials at one 
meal u day. When this tentative addition is borne without return 
of acidity, we may extend the dietary; but the use of sweet foods, 
pastry, rich or greasy foods, highly seasoned dishes, alcohol, and 
tobacco must be forbidden. 

If, on the other hand, the fermentation occurs at the expense of 
the albuminoid substances of the food, a vegetarian diet is the best, 
consisting of beans, peas, and lentils cooked in salt water, fresh 
butter being added when they are eaten ; but bread and farinaceous 
foods should be withheld for a short period. 

Hydrcjtherapy is useful, especially sulphurous waters and those 
containing the iodides. A high and dry chmate, like Buxton, the 
MalVcrn Hills, and other places, are useful aids in the treatment. 

Flatulence. — The gases which arise in the stomach as the result 
of fermentation in that viscus are CO2, hydrogen, marsh gas, and 
occasionally sulphuretted hydrogen; there are also the gases of the 
air or food which have been swallowed. In pathological conditions 
the amount of gas generated may be sufficient to cause dilatation 
of the stomach, especially when that organ is in an atonic condition. 
In such a case Kuhn^ found the gas from the stomach had the 
following composition: COg = 20, 0=83, H^sog, CH4 = 0-3, 
X = 40, CO = a trace, per cent. The oxygen in gastric flatus is 
usually from air which has been swallowed; it disappears almost 
entirely. Part is absorbed by diffusion into the tissues of the 
alimentary canal; part unites with the reducing substances in the 
stomach, and especially with the nascent hydrogen set free by butyric 
fermentation. Nitrogen also gains admission to the stomach by 
swallowing air. This gas does not diffuse into the tissues of the 
ahmentary canal, because the partial pressure of nitrogen therein 
is nearly the same as in the atmosphere; on the other hand, nitrogen 
gas diffuses out of the tissues of the ahmentary canal into its lumen. 
Hydrogen arises in consequence of butyric fermentation, and from 
the decomposition of cellulose in the lower bowel. Carbonic acid 
gas arises from the decomposition of carbohydrates and proteins 
in the stomach and bowels ; but it is also generated in the neutraliza- 
tion of acid chyme and organic acids by the sodium carbonate of 
intestinal secretions. 

The influence of these gases upon the comfort of the individual depends 
upon their coefficient of absorption. This was determined by Bunsen'to be 
as follows:

ago DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

Carbonic acid gas may be generated in large volumes without causing 
grent inconvenience, because it has a high coefficient of absorption. The 
paiti;U ]iressure of CO2 in the blood seldom exceeds 10 per cent, of an 
atmosphere; therefore, as soon as the partial pressure of the gas in the 
alimentary canal exceeds iv per cent, of an atmosphere, it begins to diffuse 
into the blood, and is excreted by the lungs. The proportion of CO2 in the 
gases of the alimentary canal varies from 20 to 50 per cent., and there is 
constantly an active diftusion of this gas into the blood, the lungs exhaling 
CO2, which has been generated from food during the process of digestion. 

Hydrogen, on the other hand, has a very low coefficient of absorption, 
because it exists in the blood and tissues in a nascent form, being dissociated 
from various substances by chemical changes going on therein. Its accumu- 
lation in the alimentary canal therefore gives rise to considerable discomfort 
until it Ls e.xpelled. Nitrogen is only slowly absorbed and in very slight 
proportion, and, when atmospheric air is swallowed, this gas causes distension 
until it is expelled. 

The coefficient of absorption of sulphuretted hydrogen is very high, more 
than a hundred times that of oxygen. In consequence of its very easy 
absorbability it is conceivable that the small amount of H2S found in the 
intestmal gases gives no indication of the amount of this gas generated in a 
given time. It is probable that a good deal of H2S is developed in the 
intestines during fermentation, and it diffuses into the blood almost as rapidly 
as it is formed. The absorption of this poisonous gas must be deleterious to 
the patient. It may cause headache, vertigo, nausea, and epigastric oppression. 

IMarsh gas is generated in the bowels in considerable quantity after living 
on a diet consisting chiefly of proteins, or after consumption of peas or beans, 
and in the decomposition of cellulose. Its coefficient of absorption is very 
low; hence the discomfort arising from the presence of this gas. 

Methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) occurs among the gases resulting from the 
decomposition of proteins by bacteria in the intestines, and also after con- 
sumption of cabbage, asparagus, etc. It is an evil-smelling gas, and Bunge 
remarks that as most of the poisonous products of protein decomposition are 
without smell, the odour of this gas gives warning of their presence. 

The diet largely influences the degree of flatulence, the kind of 
gases, and the discomfort arising from them The composition of 
gastric flatus is given above. Ruge found the composition of flatus 
from the intestines varied with different diets; thus: Patients who

suffer from flatulence should avoid the articles of food liable to 
undergo fermentation. Milk is especially injurious; many persons 
experience discomfort, fulness, and flatulence after it. Its 
lactose is decomposed into lactic acid, and the latter into butyric 
acid, with the evolution of hydrogen and COg- Carbohydrate foods 



FLATULENCE 291 

are also very likely to give rise to discomfort. Dextrose, the pro- 
duct of digestion of various carbohydrates, is split into lactic and 
butyric acids, hydrogen, and COj. The foods most likely to give 
rise to flatulence are potatoes, bread, cereals, and the legumes, 
because a large quantity of them is carried down to the lower part 
of the small intestines, where the alkalinity favours bacterial action. 
Rice, sago, tapioca, and arrowroot do not cause so much flatulence, 
because they are more readily digested, and are absorbed to a large 
extent in the upper part ol the bowels. Rice is almost entirely 
absorbed in the upper bowel. It is therefore better to recommend 
carbohydrates in these forms; they may be taken with stewed 
fruits, because the organic acids conveyed into the bowels with them 
tend to check butyric fermentation. 

Cabbage and all other vegetables containing fibrous tissues or 
much cellulose should be avoided, because they give rise to pain 
and flatulence from the decomposition of cellulose into hydrogen 
and marsh gas. 

Flatulence often arises from the air swallowed with food, eating 
the food too quickly, defective mastication, and washing down the 
food with large draughts of liquids. In such cases a feeling of 
distension occurs before the meal is over and gives rise to eructa- 
tions. Careful and slow mastication and avoiding drink during 
the meal are indications which should be followed. The fermenta- 
tion of carbohydrates in the stomach occurs in obesity, but it is 
more likely to occcur in chronic gastric catarrh, dilatation, and 
motor inefficiency. The free HCl of gastric juice causes an evolu- 
tion of CO2 even in healthy subjects by neutralizing the carbonates 
in saliva and food; this may occur also in hyperacidity, for in such 
persons Roberts found the alkalinity of saliva was abnormal, and 
frequently equal to 004 per cent, of HCl. Flatulence may be due 
to the regurgitation of gas from the duodenum and the small in- 
testines; it may also arise from the diffusion of CO., from the blood 
of the gastric veins into the stomach. This is probably the cause 
of the otherwise inexplicable attacks of " wind " which occur in 
many persons otherwise healthy. In these cases the evolution of 
gas is too rapid and too voluminous for it to arise by fermentation, 
and usually there is no reason to suspect such fermentation. It is 
a trouble which attacks healthy and hard-working women, especially 
those who are subject to nervous excitement or great emotion. 
It has been suggested that the actual cause is some disturbance of 
the expiratory function. The treatment of such cases is the pre- 
scription of light food, especially light suppers, reduction of carbo- 
hydrates, and avoidance of overwork and worry. 

Atony and Dilatation of the Stomach. 

The indigestion results in a loss of tone, atony, or myasthenia, 
and sometimes dilatation of the stomach. Aton}', frequently 
termed " gastric insufficiency," means that the stomach is unable to 



252 DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

discluugc its contents into the duodenum in normal time. It is 
often associated witli diminished gastric secretion (both pepsin and 
acid), but this is not constant. It is a sequel of long-continued 
dyspepsia; but it may result from sedentary occupation, over- 
work, acute illness, repeated losses of blood, prolonged suppuration, 
etc. K on-obstructive dilatation or primary gastrectasis is the 
result of atony, due to gastric irritation, insufficiency, or catarrh, 
with the attendant fermentation. Obstructive dilatation, or 
secondary gastrectasis, is not the result of primary weakness of 
the muscular walls; the muscles have more work than they can 
accomphsh. Up to a certain point the stomach is assisted by 
hypertrophy, but this is followed by diminished power and increas- 
ing dilatation. 1 he influence of dilatation on the nutrition of the 
body is shown in the increasing emaciation and weakness observed 
in every serious case. 

Treatment. — In atony of the stomach, or gastric insufficiency, 
the underlying condition of deficient vital power and innervation 
of the stomach must be attacked. 1 he remedies which will remove 
debility will assist in improving the contractile power of the stomach, 
will encourage motor activity, promote absorption, and increase 
the secretion and quality of gastric juice. 

The indications are — (i) lo render the digestion easy by reducing 
the quantity of food to the capacity of the stomach and selecting 
those articles suitable for the condition; (2j to excite metabolism 
and nutrition by exercise of the mind and body; (3) to remove the 
proximate cause of the disease. 

'I he food is important. Any necessary change should be gradu- 
ally produced; but there should be an immediate prohibition of 
many of the indigestible articles of diet. The condition is best 
met by a dry diet, consisting chiefly of animal substances and of 
small bulk. If the appetite flags, reasonable abstinence would be 
better than pampering the palate with dainty fare. When the 
appetite is good, the patient should stop short of satiety; it is better 
to eat too little than too much. There should be only three meals 
a day, consisting chiefly of proteins — e.g. : 

Breakfast, 8 a.m. — Fish (bole, plaice, uhiting, liaddock, turbot, brill, 
veak-fiib), with a little lemon-juice ; one or two eggs, poached or boiled lightly ; 
a small amount of crisp dry toast or stale bread; and a cupful of coffee, with 
cream and one piece of sugar. 

Midday Meal, 2 p.m. — No Meat. Boiled macaroni with a trace of grated 
J'armesan cheese, or boiled rice with tomato; puree of cabbage, savoy, or 
potato, with gravy or extract of meat; boiled spinach, vegetable marrow 
tsquash), string or snap kidney beans; any milk pudding which has been 
cooked slowly (four or five hours), jellies or creams made with gelatin, or fruit 
jelly, and cooked apples, plums, prunes, and raw fruits rubbed through a 
sieve (raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries or currants). At end of the 
meal 4 or 5 ounces of water, diluted spirit, Burgundy, or Bordeaux. 

Evening Meal, 8 p.m. — Soup, about 3 ounces; fish (same as at breakfast); 
tender lean beef or mutton, poultry, venison, pheasant, partridge, or other 
game (except hare) ; i ounce of puree of potato, or boiled rice, or toast, or 
stale bread. No pudding or dessert ; at end of meal two glasses of wine or

The idea is to give two meals mainly protein, and most of the 
carbohydrate at the midday meal. The use of diastatic substances 
is much in favour among a certain section of the profession; they 
recommend takadiastase or some form of malt extract when a 
large quantity of carbohydrate food is taken — e.g. : 

Wegele's Diet for Atony of the Stomach. 

Morning. — Dry tocist, i ounce, a cupful of cooca made of leguminose 
cocoa, and 2 ounces of cream. 

Foreuoon. — An egg (poached or soft-boiled) and i ounce of toast. 

Midday. — Scraped meat, 3^ ounces; mashed potato, 7 ounces; toast, 
I ounce; followed by i ounce of extract of malt. 

Afternoon. — A cupful of cocoa, with 2 ounces of cream. 

Evening. — Tapioca, cooked to a pulp, 10 ounces; followed by | ounce of 
extract of malt ; 10 p.m.: a tumblerful of milk, with dessert -spoonful of cognac 
brandy. 

Forbidden Articles. — All those in the list under Indigestion. The 
total liquids should not exceed i|- to 2 pints, and for a few weeks 
might usefully be reduced to f pint a day. Sweet and acid drinks 
are injurious. Excess of milk puddings and custards may do harm 
by their carbohydrates. All fish containing more than 2 per cent, 
fat is injurious (see list, pp. 11 and 229) ; other fatty foods the same. 
All boiled vegetables, except those which are very tender, must not 
be eaten unless they are rubbed through a sieve (puree) ; the same 
rule applies to fruit containing seeds and skins which cannot be 
removed. Xuts, dried peas, and beans, mushrooms, truffles, morels, 
must be avoided. 

Alcohol. — Malt liquors and sweet wines are injurious; but one or 
two glassfuls of dry wine is beneftcial. " Gastric insufficiency is 
perhaps the only stomach condition in which alcohol may be given

with benefit." ' Port is inadmissible because of its acidity; but 
Bordeaux or other good chiret or hermitage is not usually dele- 
terious. Tea, coffee, and cocoa should be taken in great modera- 
tion, and used chiefly for flavouring. 

More or less permanent atony or gastric insuflflciency occurs in 
malignant disease of \arious organs, tuberculosis, prolonged sup- 
puration, and amyloid disease, and from local causes, such as atrophy 
of the secretory glands and cancer of the stomach. There are 
degrees of insufficiency. When it is not very severe, the diet should 
be the same as in the curable forms. Severe cases tax the ingenuity 
of the physician and nurse; in fact, there are few patients more 
troublesome to feed than those in a late stage of cancer {e.g., uterine, 
ovarian, or mammary). The gastric insufficiency is progressive. 
Ver}' little food can be taken or digested; the total is not enough 
to prevent emaciation. The patients speedily tire of any article, 
and changes have to be found every day or two. Milk foods, 
junket, milk jelly, custard, milk soup, peptonized foods, Benger's

meat juice. Brand's essence, beef tea, meat juice, dried milk 
powders, meat extracts and powders, and all other light and easily- 
digested foods mav be used in succession. 

Atonic or Simple Dilatation. — The indications are — (i) To distend 
the stomach as little as possible, (2) promote evacuation of its 
contents through the pylorus, (3) keep down fermentation, (4) and 
improve the tone of the organism. These indications are fulfilled 
by the treatment and dietary detailed for atony. The food should 
be good and nutritious. The patient should lie down for at least 
half an hour after each meal. The cure is more difficult when 
motor insufficiency and hypochlorhydria are well marked. In 
such cases the treatment should be begim by confining the patient 
to bed for a time and giving a restricted diet, containing very little 
carbohydrates, and consisting of about a pint of milk witli Plasmon, 
Sanatogen, or other casein preparation, or dried milk added to it, 
in three or four doses at intervals of four or five hours ; intermediate 
meals should consist of raw eggs, beef juice, pounded cliicken, or 
fish or scraped beef, and a small amount of stale bread cut into 
thin slices and thoroughly torrefied. The total dietary should not 
yield less than 1,600 calories, the smallest amount required for a 
person at absolute rest. After ten to fourteen days the patient 
may be allowed to rise for a few hours daily and take light exercise, 
but he should continue to lie down for an hour after meals. The 
dietary may then be improved so as to yield 2,000 calories by giving 
poached or boiled eggs, minced or scraped meat, chicken panada, 
or souffle, sweetbread, sole, plaice, whiting, raw oysters, potato 
puree, spinach, vegetable marrow, occasionally cauliflower, dry 
toast, zwiebach, arrowroot, custard, junket, and cocoa, or about 
I pint of -plain water or Salutaris after meals. 

The convalescent stage requires a dietary in which the fluid does

DILATATION OF THE STOMACH 295 

not exceed ]n to 40 ounces. If hypochlorhydria exists, the carbo- 
liydrates must predominate in tlie dietary, and sliould be of an easily 
digested kind, and the food should be given warm. If, on the 
other hand, there is hyperchlorhydria, fat, especially butter and 
cream, arc useful, and proteins must predominate. Lavage is a 
useful expedient, but it is not necessary in every case. Massage, 
douching, and electrical treatment are also beneficial. Change of 
air to an upland bracing district, such as Buxton, Harrogate, 
Braemar, Clifton. Malvern, or Tunbridge, in Great Britain, or to 
various seaside resorts (but not to the south or south-west coasts) of 
England during the summer or autumn is good treatment. Swit- 
zerland, the Riviera, (ienoa, and Naples are also suitable resorts. 

Secondary, or Obstructive Dilatation. — In primary, or atonic, 
dilatation of the stomach the object of dietetics is to insure the 
emptying of the stomach as quickly as possible; we must be satisfied 
with intestinal digestion. In the secondary, or obstructive, form 
the main object is to secure the absorption of foods from the stomach 
itself. In these cases there is not usually any deficiency of the 
muscular strength; on the contrary, there may be hypertrophy of 
the muscular bands and increased power; but owing to the obstruc- 
tion, there is a relative motor insufftciency. 

In such cases it is useless to give bread, potatoes, sweet potatoes, 
oatmeal, biscuits, rusks, and vegetables; they cannot be digested 
in the stomach and their passage into the bowels is hindered. 
Their presence encourages fermentation, with its attendant heart- 
burn, flatulence, acidity, belching, and regurgitation or vomiting; 
therefore they should be omitted from the dietary. The proper 
treatment consists in giving easily digested proteins and as Httle 
undigested carbohydrate as possible. 

Milk may be given alone or with citrate of soda to prevent the 
formation of curd; it may be peptonized or pancreatized, and en- 
riched by the addition of | ounce of lactose or extract of malt to 
each I pint of milk. Both these carbohydrates are valuable; but 
lactose has an advantage over the maltose in not being fermented 
by ordinary yeasts. The rest of the food may consist of raw eggs, 
scrambled eggs, scraped or minced meat, pounded chicken, soft 
fish, oysters, meat powders, meat extracts, and casein preparations. 
We have to provide more protein to make up for the deficiency of 
carbohydrate, remembering that many proteins contain a carbo- 
hydrate complex which will be utilized by the organism. At the 
same time, we must watch the nitrogenous excretion, taking care 
that the urea output is proportionate to the intake of proteins. 
The heat value of the food prescribed must also be taken into ac- 
count, and the number of calories should not be much less than 
the same person requires during a slack time in a state of health; 
3 pints of milk, two eggs, lol ounces of meat, chicken, and fish, 
and I ounce of milk sugar will vield 2,000 to 2,200 calories. The 
question of peptonizing the food will arise; it has been shown 
that artificial digestion by pepsin or pancreatin is not quite the 



296 DiSF.isrs or Tin-: stomach 

same as normal dij^^estion Yoit, Calm, and others have shown that 
artificially digested foods are not absorbed witliout further change; 
and others, again, have shown that very little peptone is absorbed 
from the stomach The best thing to do is to reduce all food to a 
pulp by a mincing machine, to remove all stringy or fibrous portions 
by passing it through a sieve, and thus assist its passage through 
the pylorus. If, however, the obstruction becomes so great as to 
necessitate the predigestion of foods, we can have recourse to pep- 
tonized and pancreatized milk, panopepton, Liebig's peptone, 
Leube's soluble meat, \'alentine's meat juice, somatose, Mosquera's 
beef meal, Kemmerich's peptone, Denaeyer's peptone, Carnrich's 
peptonoid, Darb\''s fluid meat, etc. The predigestion of carbo- 
ludrates is unnecessary if the proper kinds are used — viz., malt 
extract, invert sugar and lactose, and milk in such a condition that 
it is easily propelled into the duodenum; but all such dietaries may 
be useless in bad cases, nutrient enemata must be resorted to, and 
the question of gastro-enterostom}^ or some other suitable opera- 
tion may be essential to prolong the life of the patient. 

Various other points require attention in both forms of dilata- 
tion. Rest after food is essential. When the patient is in bed, it 
is of importance to attend to his posture. The stomach may be- 
come more distended by the mere weight of its contents. He 
should lie upon the right side to facilitate the passage of food into 
the duodenum. Ewart recommends the foot of the bed to be 
elevated, the level of the greater curvature of the stomach to be 
thereby raised, and the distance to the pylorus lessened. The 
proper application of massage to the abdomen before breakfast or 
two or three hours after a meal, when there are no counter-indica- 
tions, would assist the stomach to discharge its contents It is 
recommended by Boas, Ewald, Riegil, Sidney Martin, and other 
authorities, but Rossenheim and Ziemssen are against it. General 
massage is useful. 

Lavage of the stomach is generally recommended, but it does not 
meet with everybody's approval. For instance, Saundby says the 
stomach-tube should not be used except when surgical aid is refused ; 
then the patient ma}' be taught to wash out his stomach each night 
to remove food residues. Most authorities, however, consider it 
to be a valuable proceeding. It should not be done too often, 
perhaps twice or thrice a week. It tends to remove motor insuffi- 
ciency. The vicus ma}' be washed out with alkaline spa waters, 
solution of carbonate of soda, water containing i per cent, of cal- 
cined magnesia, or a ^ per cent, solution of tannin. The latter is 
recommended by Hemmeter. Pain and spasm, which sometimes 
occur, are prevented by pouring into the stomach 2 or 3 ounces of 
olive-oil after lavage. An emetic (20 to 30 grains of ipecacuanha) 
is valuable for patients who refuse lavage; it empties the stomach, 
causes contraction, and squeezes morbid secretions out of the 
glands. The stomach may be too feeble to respond to such stimu- 
lation; in such cases lavage must be adopted. In most cases a 



CATARRH OF TTIE STOMACH 297 

beneficial effect soon follows its use When lavage fails, the intra- 
gastric si)ray may be used. Galvanism is also useful; the con- 
tinuous current should be used, the negative electrode to the nape 
of the neck, and tlic positive to the epigastrium. The electrodes 
should be covered by flannel. 

The general health must receive attention. The patient should 
be ordered rest from business or domestic worry, change of air in 
the moorlands or mountains. Irregular hours and meals must be 
avoided. The patient should go to bed early and rise early; the 
bedroom must be well ventilated. The body must be kept clean, 
but frequent hot baths are injurious; shower-baths are beneficial 
to some and sea-baths to others. Exercise is important; it should 
be taken about three hours after a meal, or before a meal. Walking 
and riding short of fatigue, gymnastics, tennis, croquet, golf, etc., 
are useful. 

Gastroptosis causes stagnation of the contents of the stomach, 
with a sensation of weight, fulness, oppression, nausea, or vomiting. 
It is associated with functional disorders of the stomach and 
neurasthenia. The neurasthenia should be treated by the " rest 
cure." Many of the symptoms disappear when the recumbent 
posture is assumed. The diet, at first, should be similar to that 
for dilated stomach: minced meat, chicken, or fish; puree of vege- 
tables; dry toast, zwiebach; butter, honey. The food should be 
eaten without drinking; mastication must be carefully performed; 
liquids should be taken between meals. A diet for. overfeeding 
should be gradually built up to improve nutrition and cause the 
accumulation of a few pounds of fat in the abdomen. After the 
rest cure, the diet must be that required for the associated con- 
ditions — atonv, hyperacidity, etc. A belt should be worn; the 
patient should be taught to sit upright and to breathe properly. 
Surgical treatment is sometimes necessary. 

Catarrh of the Stomach. 

Acute Gastric Catarrh. — It occasionally follows catarrh of the 
respirator\- organs, influenza, diphtheria, fevers, septicaemia, but 
it is more often due to local irritation by taking an excess of certain 
foods, tinned foods, substances which are fermented or decomposed, 
acid wines, spirits, mineral acids, alkalies, and other irritant poisons. 

1. Acute Phlegmonous Gastntis.—Jhe extreme irritability con- 
tra-indicates oral feeding; nevertheless, it is proper to give a little 
ice, ice-water, albumin-water, barley-water, and cream, Valentine's 
meat juice, Brand's essence of beef, and small quantities of demul- 
cent liquids. Rectal feeding should be resorted to after twenty- 
four or thirty-six hours if mouth feeding cannot be borne. When 
the severity of the inflammation is subsided, the dietary for the 
subacute form may be adopted. 

2. Subacute Gastritis. — 1 he symptoms are milder, the prognosis 
favourable. '1 he stomach must be rested. Ice, ice-water, barley- 



.-qS DISn.lSES OF THE STOMACH 

water and cream, raw-meat juice, ^^^^entine's or Brand's meat 
juices, may be given. The COg in Perricr, Apollinaris, and other 
waters is sedative; the alkahes in ApolHnaris, Ems, Vichy, or Vals 
waters neutrahzes acidity, lessens the toughness of mucus, assists 
its e\-acuation, and moderates hypcniimia. Mucilaginous fluids 
check irritability {e.g., decoction of inner bark of elm, tragacanth, 
or isinglass emulsions). When the irritation begins to subside, 
pain and vomiting to cease, we may begin to give equal parts of 
milk and barlej'-water, lime-water, or soda-water. If these are 
vomited, let i grain of sodium citrate or 3 grains of potassium 
bicarbonate be added to each ounce of milk. Some patients retain 
arrowroot and milk, Benger's food, or jelly, when they vomited other 
foods. The proper quantity to give is i ounce of fluid every half 
hour, I ounce of farinaceous food every three hours, and some 
Brand's essence, Valentine's meat juice, or jelly, at times between 
the other feeds. 

As improvement occurs we may cautiously add chicken broth, 
veal broth, custard, junket, sago or tapioca pudding, rice-milk. 
The quantity must be small, but may be gradually increased. 
When these things are well tolerated, we should try a poached egg, 
then some .sole, plaice, or whiting, and a spoonful of potato puree. 
Gradually add bread-and-butter, spinach, vegetable marrow, puree 
of cabbage, cauliflower, stewed prunes, baked apples, and cooked 
plums. These may be followed by chicken and tripe. The return 
to ordinary diet ought to be very gradual, otherwise the catarrh 
may become chronic. The future dietary must be that for dyspep- 
tics, and the articles to be avoided are those detailed under that 
heading. 

Chronic Gastric Catarrh {Chronic Gastritis) may follow acute or 
subacute gastritis, and any of the causes of indigestion and gastric 
irritation previoush' mentioned, by their persistence, may induce 
it. It may also be secondary to influenza, fevers, hypersemia of 
the liver, diseases of the heart, lungs, or pleura. It occurs in persons 
of chronic ill-health, sedentary habits, or a phlegmatic disposition ; 
it is favoured by cold, damp climates, and wet seasons. It is most 
common in middle life, but is also met with in elderly people and 
even at the period of puberty. 

Treatment.- — Most cases of primary gastric catarrh of the stomach 
are curable by careful and persistent treatment, and secondary 
catarrh often disappears after careful treatment of the stomach 
and other diseased organs. To this end all indigestible foods must 
be forbidden; also malt liquors, spirits, excess of tea, coffee, and 
tobacco. Careful attention must be given to the teeth; pyorrhoea 
alveolaris must be cured. The food must be eaten slowly and care- 
fully masticated. The patient should rest a short time before 
meals and a longer time afterwards. His life must be carefully 
and well regulated. It should be free from worry; rest and tran- 
quillity should prevail, but the mind and body must be regularly 
occupied in moderation. 1 he indications may be classed as foHows: 



CATARRH OF THE STOMACH 299 

To — (i) select food of a kind and quality to suit the morbid condition 
and improve its nutrition; (2) excite the function of digestion by 
reasonable exercise adapted to the strength and condition of the 
patient; (3) encourage the harmonious action of the alimentary 
canal; (4) correct any morbid condition which predisposes to or 
aggravates the catarrh. 

The diet is of paramount importance; but patients vary so much 
that no stereotyped i)rescription will suit them all. Everything 
depends on the ability of the stomach to digest and propel its con- 
tents into the intestines. 1 he degrees of gastric catarrh vary from 
a slight diminution of the functions of the mucosa to absolute loss 
of secretion or atrophy of the gastric glands. An examination of 
the gastric contents after a test meal shows (i) diminution of HCl, 
or (2) absence of HCl, or (3) absence of the gastric ferments. The 
amount of free HCl is always diminished. If 02 per cent, of this 
acid is present we must exclude gastric catarrh and look for 
another disease. Much mucus in the vomit is a valuable 
indication of catarrh. The existence of gastric ferments should 
be ascertained. 

The diet may include every food which the stomach is able to digest 
and propel into the duodenum in a proper time. In some cases the 
digestion of proteins is defective, while that of carbohydrates is 
perfect. In these cases some authorities order that animal foods 
should be abstained from and proteins given in a prepared or semi- 
digested form; but, although the gastric juice is deficient in quality 
or quantity, there are digestive secretions in the bowels. More- 
over, the patient must have some protein, or the condition of the 
body will never improve. Fatty foods arc more or less deleterious, 
because they check gastric secretion; but a moderate amount of 
cream and butter are usually allowed. Farinaceous, saccharine, 
mucilaginous, and gelatinous foods are usually digested well, but 
if the motor power of the stomach is defective, farinaceous foods 
may ferment and cause flatulence, organic acidity, eructation of 
flatus or fluids, or distension, and aggravate the evil we wish to 
remedy. Milk does not agree with all cases; but when the disease 
is due to alcoholism, we should persist in its use. If it is not borne 
well at first, let it be tried with citrate of soda, bicarbonate of potash, 
lime-water, barley-water, Perrier or Apollinaris water. If plain 
milk still disagrees, try the milk powders, casein preparations, 
peptonized milk, whey, or buttermilk. So strongly did Niemeyer 
approve of buttermilk for chronic gastritis that he wrote: " When 
the patient is hungry, let him eat buttermilk; when he is thirsty 
let him drink buttermilk." The advantages arc that it contains 
very little fat and forms light flocculent curds in the stomach. 
The dietary may be divided as follows: 

I. In mild cases no limitation of food is necessary, providing it 
is of the right kind and quality-. The foods and restrictions for 
ordinary indigestion are proper. The following may be useful to 
begin treatment: 



300 DISEASnS OF THE STOMACH 

Breakfast. — Eggs, lightly boiled or poached; fish of the lighter kinds; dry 
toast or rusk; cocoa made with milk, or milk-tea (China tea infused with boiled 
milk instead of water). 

Luiich. — Mutton or lamb free from fat (inside of leg or underside of shoulder), 
mashed potato, milk pudding. 

Tea. — A cup of China tea, thin slice of bread-and-butter, Marie biscuit, or 
sponge cake. 

Dinner. — No soup; fish of a light kind; tender beef, mutton, lamb, fowl, 
pheasant, guinea-fowl, breast of turkey; potato puree, spinach, vegetable 
marrow (squash), cauliflower, seakale, fiTsh green peas, asparagus, spring 
cabbage, milk pudding, custard or junket with stewed fruit, jelly and cream, 
white bread, rusk, toast, or plain biscuit. 

Things to he avoided. — In every case of gastric catarrh it is 
necessary to remove every particle of gristle and skin of fibrous 
material from meat, fowl, or fish ; to avoid heating sauces and rich 
foods, such as articles cooked in fat and containing much fat — e.g., 
pork, veal, high game, duck, goose, turkey (except the breast), fat 
meat, fried meat and fish, tinned meat and meat pastes. Fat ham, 
bacon, butter, and other fats ought to be forbidden because they 
check the secretion of gastric juice. Fish containing more than 
2 per cent, of fat should not be ordered; others should be forbidden 
—e.g., sardines — because of the small bones and scales. Salted or 
smoked meat and fish and all twice-cooked foods (entrees, etc.) 
are forbidden; also hot bread or pastry, brown bread, porridge, 
cakes and biscuits with seeds or fruit. All fruits containing seeds 
and skins which cannot be removed — e.g., currants, gooseberries, 
cranberries, blackberries, bilberries, strawberries, grapes, and figs) 
should onlj' be allowed after they are rubbed through a sieve. 
Nuts are taboo. Raw fruit can be allowed in moderation when 
the skin, strings, and seeds have been removed — e.g., apples, pears, 
bananas, oranges, grapes, plums, and peaches. Raw vegetables 
of all sorts should be rejected; also pickles. Cooked fibrous vege- 
tables, such as cabbage, swedes {Ruta haga), turnips, artichokes, 
sweet potatoes, carrots, cannot be allowed unless they are rubbed 
through a sieve and made into puree. Cheese, condiments, ices, 
etc., are forbidden. 

2 . In cases of medium severity the patient may have any food which 
has been passed through a sieve, besides soups, broths, puree of 
vegetables, consomme, meat powder, scraped meat, poached or soft- 
boiled eggs, fight fish, tender lean meat or chicken. Stale bread, 
toast, rusk, zwnebach, biscuit (cracker), may all be taken if they 
are well and carefully masticated Macaroni, vermicelH, spha- 
ghetti; sponge cakes, Madeira cake; honey, golden syrup; fruit 
jelly, such as apple, damson, quince, orguava; apple sauce, apricot 
sauce; and other fruits {vide supra), after being passed through a 
sieve, are permissible. The supply of carbohydrates as a rule 
should not be restricted provided they do not include fibrous vege- 
tables. The use of arrowroot, tous les mois, corn-starch, blanc- 
mange, and porridge should be prohibited, because they are swallowed 
without mastication and do not get mixed with saliva, t Cream 
and butter are allowed in strict moderation; but fat meat and excess 



CATARRH OF TIIH STOMAC/I 301 

of butter arc forbidden. Spices and condiments are useful by 
stimulating the gastric secretion, and by their carminative and 
aromatic effects. 

At tlie beginning of treatment such patients should have a mixed 
solid and liquid did. Breakfast and supper should consist of boiled 
milk with stale bread, toast, rusks, or bread-and-butter. The 
midday meal of boiled fish, chicken, or scraped beef, with bread 
and butter. Fish should consist of sole, plaice, whiting, fresh had- 
dock or turbot, boiled or steamed, freed from skin and bone, and 
pounded in a mortar; a little cream may be added. Chicken should 
be done in the same way. Beef is prepared thus: Three or four 
ounces of fillet or rump steak is lightly broiled with a little salt; it 
is then cut open and the red pulp scraped away from the fibrous 
tissue. The scrapings are eaten as sandwiches, being spread on 
thin bread-and-butter, and sprinkled with salt. Between the meals 
a glassful of boiled milk is to be taken. If the diet disagrees, more 
fluids must be given. If it agrees, a gradual advance should be 
made. Thus, at the midday meal some unpounded sole, plaice, 
whiting, or breast of chicken may be tried. A few days later, a 
piece of tender fillet steak, not too much broiled, may be allowed 
for a change, and some very thin rice pudding. Articles named 
above may each be tried in turn. A patient can subsist on such 
a diet and perform his duties without discomfort. It is very suit- 
able for cases of gastric catarrh of two or four months' duration, 
and with little vomiting. The duration of such treatment is a 
matter of judgment; but additions must be gradually made until 
it attains the character of a modified ordinary diet. The rules for 
this are the same as for bad indigestion (q.v.). The addition of 
each article should be experimental. What is digestible for one 
person is indigestible for another. In most cases protein foods 
should preponderate, because fat and carbohydrate are httle di- 
gested in the stomach, and throw a strain on the diseased organ. 
This diet should, then, consist of scraped beef or mutton, the inside 
of a chop or cutlet, a slice from the underside of a shoulder or 
inner-side of a leg of mutton; the breast or wing of boiled chicken, 
breast of pigeon; or boiled or steamed fish (sole, plaice, whiting, 
turbot, fresh haddock); lightly boiled or poached eggs; potatoes 
rubbed through a sieve, spinach, boiled lettuce, vegetable marrow 
(squash), cauliflower, kidney beans (string or snap), green peas, 
seakale, boiled onions; puddings of ground rice, sago, tapioca, 
arrowroot, baked flour and milk; white bread, toast, rusks, plain 
biscuits. A little butter and cream; a small amount of mustard, 
vanilla, or almond flavouring. China tea or peptonized cocoa may 
be aflowed. A tablespoonful of whisky or brandy well diluted, or 
a glassful of well-matured claret, burgundy, or dry champagne, 
may be allowed with lunch and dinner. 

J. In severe cases, where the patient complains that everything 
disagrees and \omiting occurs every da\- or two, a liquid diet is 
essential. This may consist of 3 or 4 pints of milk taken in turn- 



302 DISEASES OE THE STOMACH 

blerful doses every two hours. It should be boiled or baked and 
cooled down to that temperature which is most agreeable to the 
patient, preferably lukewarm. Cold or hot milk is liable to cause 
pain. Occasionally some Bovril, Oxo, or other extract of meat, or 
some essence of coffee or peptonized cocoa may be put in some 
milk to alter the flavour. This diet ma}^ be continued for two to 
four weeks according to the effect; but the expenditure of the body 
should be kept in mind, the minimum when a person is resting being 
1,000 calories (supplied by 4 pints of milk), and when absolutely 
quiet in bed, 1,400 calorics (supplied by 3^ pints of milk). If a 
person endeavours to follow his occupation on this diet, a reduction 
of weight must be expected. When relief from pain and sickness 
is secured, some improvement in the diet may be made, thus: 

Breakfast. — Two ounces of stale bread is to be boiled in water and passed 
through a sieve or well beaten with a fork, and added to i pint of boiled milk. 
It may be varied by farinaceous food, such as Benger's, Savory and ^Moore's, 
or Neave's food. 

Midday. — The same, with the white of two raw eggs mixed in the food, 
or an ounce of raw-meat juice or a cup of extract of meat may be taken before 
the food. 

Evening Meal. — Bread and milk, i pint, at five or six o'clock. 

Bedtime. — A tumblerful of milk. 

The duration of the diet must vary with the effects. It ought 
to be continued so long as there is any bacterial fermentation or 
acidity in the stomach. When a sufficiently marked improvement 
is observed, the patient should be put on the mixed liquid and solid 
food. Benger's, Savory and Moore's, Neave's, or AUenbury's food, 
made with milk, should be first given ; then arrowroot, tons les niois, 
tapioca, or sago pudding, and some well-dried toast, torrefied bread, 
or rusk, and butter. Cautiously add to the dietary: Poached eggs, 
steamed light fish, scraped meat sandwiches ; chicken cream, panada, 
or souffle, and other kinds of meat which have been passed through 
a sieve, with potato puree, vegetable puree, spinach, vegetable 
marrow, seakale, boiled lettuce; finally breast of chicken, pheasant, 
or guinea fowl, tender mutton, undercut of beef, and ordinary milk 
puddings. 

Leube arranged the following progressive dietaries for such 
patients: (i) Clear soup or broth, solution of meat, milk, eggs — 
raw or lightly cooked — and plain or aerated water. (2) Add to the 
former boiled bread and milk, boiled chicken or pigeon, and calves' 
brains. (3) Add a small amount of bread and underdone beef- 
steak; the latter should be beaten, and the most tender portioii 
scraped away and lightly cooked in butter. (4) Add roast chicken, 
partridge, pigeon, underdone beef (hot or cold) from a joint, maca- 
roni, a small amount of cooked green vegetables, or salad or fruit, 
and a small amount of wine. 

Leube 's solution of meat is prepared as follows: Mince 2} pounds of lean 
meat, place it in a quart of water and 6 ounces of pure hydrochloric acid, 
and put it into a I'apin's digester, and boil it for ten to fifteen hours. It 
should then be removed from the vessel, rubbed to a paste in a mortar, and 



GASTRIC ULCER 3^3 

again boiled in the digcstLr for twenty hours. The substance should now be 
neutralized by the grailual addition of bicarbonate of soda while constantly 
stirring it, and subsequently evaporated to a syrupy consistence. The solu- 
tion should measure not less than 35 ounces; i lluid ounce represents an 
ounce oi meat. It may be taken in tablespoonful or wiueglasslul doses; a 
small amount of salt may be adtled if necessary (but the soda and 11 CI produce 
salt), and the liquid may be warmed or mixed with an equal quantity of nearly 
boiling water. It is a useful food in gastric catarrh, hypochlorhydria, ulcer, 
or carcinoma of the stomach, etc. 

Beverages for Chronic Gastric Catarrh.- — Alcohol ought to be for- 
bidden; but the subject cannot easil}^ be dismissed. Many patients 
have been accustomed to it, and cannot, or will not, give it up; 
but they must be forbidden to take port, sherry, madeira, spirits, 
and malt liquors. They may be allowed a little good Bordeaux, 
Burgund}', or red Hungarian wine, although in severe cases it 
must be diluted with an alkaline water. Hot liquids should he for- 
bidden ; everN'thing should be drunk only warm. A cupful of 
China tea, thin cocoa, or some whey, buttermilk, Salutaris, Perrier, 
ApoUinaris, and other gaseous waters are the best beverages. Indian 
and Ceylon tea should be avoided. Vals, Vichy, Ems, Bilin, 
Cauterets, Plombieres, Carlsbad, Friedrichschall, Condal, Rubinat, 
or Hunyadi Janos waters are all useful according to the effect de- 
sired; they should be taken warm. 

Lavage of the stomach is a valuable aid to dietetic treatment. 
It is best done in the morning with a warm solution of sodium bi- 
carbonate and chloride. If lavage is objected to, an emetic given 
to the patient twice a week is a useful procedure. 

Moderate exercise is of extreme value in medium and mild cases; 
walking, golf, tennis, and riding may be used. Swedish exercises 
are good. 

A change of climate is useful. A sea voyage, even when sickness 
occurs, is beneficial. Change from a warm moist climate to a 
drier and bracing atmosphere in some, and away from a bleak 
mountainous district to a warm, dry air for others. A season in 
Devonshire is good for some ; but the drier air of Brighton, Bourne- 
mouth, Margate, Pau, Cannes, Nice, Pisa, Rome, Algiers, Eg3'pt, 
for those with relaxed state of the system. Harrogate, Ilkley, 
Buxton, Matlock, Malvern, Clifton, the Scottish and Swiss resorts 
are for those with passive congestions, anaemia, neurasthenia, or 
other nervous affections. 



The Treatment of Gastric and Duodenal Ulcer. 

The " rest-cure " must be carried out with thoroughness; it is 
a sine qua non of successful treatment. Absolute physiological 
rest is essential. We must therefore insist upon confinement to 
bed for at least fourteen or twenty-one days, to give rest to the body 
and reduce the requirements of the system to the lowest quantity. 
If absolute rest is not obtained, a mild case may be relieved by 
dietetic treatment; but under such circumstances relapses fre- 



304 L)15Easj:s or the stomach 

quently occur: tlicrcforc, treatment without rest in bed is not 
recommended. Having secured this important item, the further 
indications are — (i) To avoid all foods which would physically or 
chemically irritate the ulcer; (2) to avoid such foods as cause a pro- 
longed secretion of gastric juice, remain a long time in the stomach, 
or stimulate muscular contraction ; (3) to permit such foods as are 
prescribed in small quantities only, and so avoid distension of the 
stomach. The more the stomach is contracted, the nearer the 
edges of the ulcer come together, the better will granulation and 
healing be favoured. The diet will depend upon the severity of 
the case. 

In mild cases the treatment should be begun by giving an ex- 
clusive milk diet — say 2 ounces every hour and half from 6 a.m. to 
10 p.m., or 24 ounces in twenty-four hours. This will yield about 
500 calories. If it causes pain or vomiting, it should be peptonized, 
or given with 2 grains of citrate of soda in each ounce. It is allow- 
able to use lime-water, Vich}- water, or any other alkaline water 
with the object of preventing curds, the chief source of trouble; 
but the bulk of the food is increased without adding nutriment. 
On the second day of treatment give 3 ounces of milk every two 
hours. The amount of milk should now be increased \ pint daily 
until 3 pints are taken. Each pint yields 410 calories, and the 
amount of heat given off by the body during absolute rest in bed 
is 1,400 or 1,500 calories; so that the nutriment derived from 
3 pints of milk is not enough to prevent wasting of the body. After 
three or four days, therefore, it is advisable to add to the diet two 
raw eggs dail}', and some dried milk powder or casein preparation 
(Plasmon or Sanatogen) may be added to the milk. Benger's food 
may be used, and once a day about an ounce of dry breadcrumbs 
may be well soaked in boiling water, strained, beaten to a pulp, 
and mixed with 3 ounces of milk. Some raw-meat juice, calf's-foot 
jelly. Brand's essence, etc., may be given. An exclusive milk diet 
is a semi-starvation diet. The minimum required to supply the 
heat given off during absolute rest in bed is 4 pints. This would 
mean 16 teacupfuls a day. It is scarcely possible to maintain this 
standard, although there are many patients who can take 3 pints 
of milk a day, besides other foods. But meat extracts and essences 
of all kinds should strictly be avoided, because they tend to stimu- 
late gastric secretion and exaggerate the condition of hyper- 
acidity. 

After two or three weeks of milk diet we may gradually increase 
the consistence and calorie value of the food. For this purpose 
we should, first of all, use dextrinized cereal foods, such as a fine 
biscuit powder (AUenbury's, Neave's, Ridge's, or Savory and 
Moore's food), baked fine oatmeal, arrowroot, tous les mois. If 
these are tolerated, we should gradually increase the solidity of the 
food by adding baked custard, junket, peptonized milk gruel, 
long-boiled fine oatmeal gruel, and scraped meat, chicken souffle, 
or panada. Alter a week or ten da}s of such dietary, an experi- 



ULCER OF THE STOMACH 305 

ment may be made with a small quantity of light fish — e.g., sole, 
plaice, whiting, or fresh haddock — -mashed potato, and stale bread 
(free from crust). If no recurrence of the symptoms occurs, some 
stale bread-and-butter, Madeira and sponge cake, or Marie bis- 
cuits, may be allowed with a cup of tea. Thence onward a gradual 
return to ordinary diet should be made, care being taken to avoid 
all foods which are indigestible, or would unduly tax the at present 
weak organ. 

In severe cases of ulcer, with pain, vomiting, and h?emorrhage, 
most authorities agree that nothing should be allowed by the 
mouth for about a week. As a general rule pain ceases when no 
food is put into the stomach to irritate the ulcer. This fact serves 
to distinguish an ulcer from a neurotic stomach. Nervous gas- 
tralgia or cardialgia often simulates an ulcer of the stomach; but 
in these cases the freedom from pain only lasts while the novelty 
of the treatment lasts. All mouth-feeding, therefore, should be 
stopped, and rectal feeding adopted. Care must be exercised in 
the performance of rectal feeding. The meal should consist of not 
more than 5 or 6 fluid ounces. It may be administered through a 
No. 12 rubber catheter, to which is joined a piece of rubber tube 
and a glass funnel. The patient may lie on her back or side, or in 
the knee-elbow position (the latter is impossible when the patient 
is very ill) ; the funnel should be held about 2 feet above the 
patient's hips, the fluid poured into it, and allowed to enter the 
colon by gravitation. Some practitioners use a glass rectal tube, 
but the catheter is preferred by most people, and it is believed that 
it can be insinuated farther up the rectum, and even into the sig- 
moid flexure. Ewart^ prescribes continuous rectal alimentation, 
as follows: The catheter, previously attached to 2 or 3 feet of 
rubber tube, is inserted into the rectum as far as it will go without 
doubling, and allowed to remain in all day. At the opposite end 
of the rubber tube is fixed the body of a 5-ounce glass syringe. A 
clip is put upon the tube, and the flow through it so regulated that 
5 ounces of fluid will pass through it in two hours. Ewart pre- 
scribes the following mixture: To i pint of milk add two raw eggs, 
beaten up, two teaspoonfuls of extract of malt, and a little brandy. 
The idea of rectal feeding originally was to give the patient 
enough nutriment to supply the waste of the tissues during the 
starvation period, and a little over to help the healing process. It 
is now well known that it is impossible to maintain the body in 
equilibrium by rectal feeding, that, in fact, only about one-eighth 
the amount of nutriment required by the body during absolute 
rest is absorbed from the lower bowel, and that the patient remains 
during this period in a state of subnutrition — in other words, the 
body wastes because it is living upon its own tissues. Griffiths 
mentions two guides as to the adequacy of the nutrition afforded 
in this way: When the patient is amply fed, the tongue is moist and 
the breath is sweet; but when the patient is starving, or the nutri-

20 



3o6 DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

tion very inadequate, the breath is tainted or offensive, there is 
considerable thirst, and the tongue is dr^-. Some authorities, 
obser\ing the small amount of nutriment absorbed, question the 
necessity for rectal feeding during the time when nothing is allowed 
by the mouth; they say nutrient enemata satisfy the mind, but 
not the body. This statement is true. But rectal feeding is better 
than absolute starvation, however inadequate it may be. Ex- 
perience has shown that it cannot be safely continued alone for more 
than ten days; the absorption of nutriment is too scanty, and the 
risks from starvation quite as serious as those from stomach 
feeding. 

It is, however, a fact established by experience that when rectal 
feeding is properh' carried out, the patient is usually free from pain, 
hunger, vomiting, and thirst, after a few days of treatment. Various 
troubles are liable to arise during rectal feeding. The mucous mem- 
brane becomes very irritable; it is therefore advisable to wash out 
the bowel once a day with a pint or so of warm boracic lotion or 
other mild antiseptic, to check putrefaction and subdue irritabilit}'. 
The addition of a few drops of laudanum to alternate " feeds " will 
assist in reducing irritation. A few grains of common salt also 
helps to keep down the sensibilit}', and assists in the absorption of 
egg-albumin; the addition of bicarbonate of sodium checks undue 
acidity. Mumps sometimes occurs, and requires ordinary treat- 
ment, but it ma}' go on to suppuration. This may be prevented 
by the use of a mouth-wash. 

1 he question of allowing fluids by the mouth during the first few 
days of the treatment has also to be considered. As a general rule 
nothing whatever should he allowed by the mouth for four or five days. 
If medicines are necessar}', the}' should be injected subcutaneously. 
Some authorities allow small pieces of ice, iced water, Vals, Vichy, 
or other alkaline waters, to quench the thirst. King allows a tea- 
spoonful of plain water every quarter of an hour, amounting to 
15 ounces in twentj'-four hours, on the supposition that the quantity 
is too small to irritate the ulcer, and is very soon absorbed, or 
passes through the pylorus. Large quantities certainl}' do harm. 
If we act on the principle of giving absolute rest to the stomach, 
even the small amount recommended by King should be forbidden ; 
it may excite gastric secretion or peristaltic action. Thirst subsides 
considerably after one day, or it can be checked by frequently 
washing the mouth with boracic lotion. The injection of 10 to 
20 ounces of water into the bowel immediately after the daily 
" wash-out " quenches thirst, and satisfies the demands of the system 
as far as water is concerned. It is held by many authorities that 
this is the chief benefit derived from rectal feeding. The destruc- 
tion of tissue proteins which occurs during starvation results in the 
production of water; the amount originating from the oxidation 
of food under normal feeding is 10 or 12 ounces a day, and it is 
considered that this is not reduced when the body is living on itself. 
After four or five days of absolute rest of the stomach, the patient 



ULCER OF THE STOMACH 307 

may be given as a test two or three teaspoonfuls of milk and barley- 
water, milk and citrate of soda, or peptonized milk. If these 
cause neither pain nor sickness, the quantity may be increased the 
next day to i ounce every two hours, and continually increased 
by -^ pint daily for three or four days. We may now add some dried 
milk or casein preparation to the milk, and give somatose, nutrose, 
eucasin, peptones, or Leube's soluble meat. After this we should 
gradually increase the consistence and quantity of the food, and 
diminish the number of rectal feeds. 

If the first meal by the mouth causes pain, we must desist for a 
few days longer, and rely upon rectal feeding, if necessary, up to the 
fifteenth da}^ It is impossible to maintain nutritional equilibrium 
all that time; the patient persistently loses weight and a considerable 
amount of muscle and fat. This loss is soon retrieved on returning 
to gastric feeding, if the absorption is normal. As soon as possible, 
after mouth feeding is properly established, we may begin to treat 
the ulcer in the same way as in a mild case, the food consisting of 
milk, junket, custard, raw eggs, jelly, stale breadcrumbs soaked in 
boiling water and beaten to a pulp, arrowroot, jelly, baked fine oat- 
meal, biscuit powder, and raw-meat juice; later on, scraped meat, 
chicken panada, light fish, and other foods suitable for treatment 
of the less severe cases of ulcer, may be given. The following is 
an outline of the treatment adopted by myself in most haemorrhagic 
cases: 

First to Fourth Day. — Nothing to be given by the mouth. Feed by the 
bowel every six hours with the following "feeds" alternately: («) Raw 
egg, S ounces of peptonized milk, |- teaspoonful of salt, i teaspoonful of 
brandy, twice a day. (b) Milk, 6 ounces ; extract of malt, 3 teaspoonfuls ; 
laudanum, 15 drops, twice a daj'. Allow the malt ten minutes to act on the 
milk before it is injected. Wash out the rectum once a day with boracic 
lotion. Inject once a day i pint of water and salt, after washing out the 
rectum. The mouth to be washed out very frequently with boracic lotion. 

Fifth Day. — Give by the mouth i ounce of peptonized milk every one and a 
half hours, and i ounce of raw-meat juice, with the same amount of port wine 
twice daily. Continue rectal feeding, washing out the bowels and mouth, as 
before. 

Sixth Day. — Give 2 ounces of peptonized milk every two hours, one raw egg 
in milk, raw-meat juice, and rectal feeds as before. 

Seventh Day. — Milk, 27 ounces, in doses of 3 ounces every two hours, two 
raw eggs in milk, i ounce of beef juice, and i ounce of port wine; rectal feeds 
as before. 

Eighth and Ninth Days. — Milk, 35 ounces: 4 ounces every two hours; two 
raw eggs in milk; i ounce of beef juice; and i ounce of wine daily. Benger's 
food, I pint ; a small cupful of tea. Two rectal feeds daily. 

Tenth Day. — Milk, 2 pints; Benger's food, i pint; two raw eggs; beef juice 
and wine; ]\Iarie biscuits ; tea. 

Eleventh and Ttuelfth Days. — Feed every two hours. Milk, 2^ pints; 
Benger's food, i pint; two raw eggs; fish {plaice or sole), 2 ounces ; mashed 
potato (one tablespoonful) ; butter with potato; thin bread-and-butter (no 
crust) ; Marie biscuits ; sponge cake ; tea. 

Thirteenth Day. — Milk, 2\ pints ; chicken panada instead of fish ; other foods 
as on twelfth day. 

Fourteenth Day. — Milk, 2^ pints; chicken or fish cream; other foods as 
before. 



308 DTSFASES OF THE STOMACH 

Fifteenth to Thirtieth Days. — Milk, 2 J to 3 pints daily; Benger's food twice 
a day ; two eggs (raw, lightly boiled, or poached) ; tish (sole, plaice, or whiting) ; 
breast of chicken ; tender underdone meat or scraped meat ; mashed potato and 
butter; spinach; soup with lentil flour; bread without crust, butter, cream, 
sugar, tea. or coffee ; Slarie biscuit, sponge cake, Madeira cake (without fruit) ; 
stewed rhubarb, apple sauce, custard, jimket, sago or tapioca pudding; 
orange juice, grapes freed from skin and seeds ; jelly, fruit jelly. 

Under proper care, an ulcer of the stomach usually heals in about 
three weeks. But the after-treatment of the patient is important. 
A careful regimen should be enforced, particular attention being 
given to the diet, the avoidance of dyspepsia, the correction of 
constipation, chlorosis, anaemia, and other irregularities. 

The treatment indicated above ought to be carried out whenever 
it is possible. Experience has shown it to be the safest and surest 
mode, and the one most likely to produce a permanent cure. If a 
good result is not obtained, it is probable there are complications, 
such as perigastric adhesions, burrowing of the ulcer, induration 
and thickening of the edges of the ulcer, or perhaps stenosis of the 
pylorus. In these cases relief will follow rest of the stomach, the 
hyperemia or catarrh will abate, but permanent benefit cannot 
be anticipated; an operation may be necessary. The indications 
for operative interference were classified by Von Leube as follows: 
(i) When gastric bleeding continues, or occurs repeatedly, and 
resists medical treatment; (2) when medical treatment fails to 
relieve pain, and persistent vomiting with inanition occurs; (3) in 
perigastritis, or abscess associated with the ulcer — e.g., subdia- 
phragmatic or perirenal abscess ; (4) when there is perforation of 
the ulcer. 

The opinions of a few eminent physicians is appended. Ewald of 
Berlin says that gastric ulcer is one of the most satisfactory diseases 
to treat if the ulcer be not too old and there are no cicatricial 
contractions or adhesions to surrounding parts. He treats all cases 
suspected to be ulcer of the stomach by absolute rest in bed, absten- 
tion from mouth feeding for five or six days, and rectal feeding. 
He quenches thirst by small pellets of ice, hunger by a few drops of 
cocaine, and severe gastric pain by a small injection of morphine 
into the skin of the epigastrium. After this period he allows a 
test-meal consisting of a few spoonfuls of thin oatmeal, wheat- 
meal gruel, somatose, or nutrose. If the pain returns, he goes back 
to rectal feeding entirely. If there is no pain after the meal, he 
permits more food to be given the next day; and in three or four 
days adds an}' of the easily digested foods, in a semihquid form. 
The amount and consistence of the gastric meals is increased daily, 
and the rectal feeding is gradually dropped. 

Sir Lauder Brunton^ begins the treatment of gastric ulcer by 
giving, in addition to nutrient enemata, a tablespoonful of milk 
and lime-water every two hours, gradually increasing the amount 
if the patient can take it without causing pain; if it causes pain, 

^ Brit. Med. Jour., 1902, i. 497. 



ULCIiR OF THE STOMACH 309 

the quantity is dimiaiblicd. After a few days, he gives custard; if 
this is borne without pain, he goes on to pounded fish, chicken, or 
meat. A nice hquid iood or " cream" can be made of these — e.g., 
take the breast of a chicken, cut it into thin sHces, pound it in a 
mortar with a httle chicken broth or beef-tea until it is a paste, and 
add a httle more broth until it is of the consistence of milk or cream. 
Patients drink this liquid who will not take chicken-paste or 
panada. Brunton says avoid irritating the stomach by anything 
that will harm it chemically or mechanically. In the after-treatment 
avoid pepper, cayenne, vmegar, pickles, strawberries, raspberries, 
raisins, currants, and other fruit containing seeds, all kinds of nuts, 
all stones and bones, skins of fruit, skin or gristle of meat, fish- 
bones, spiculae of bones, and vegetables containing cellulose. 

Fleiner^ confines the patient to bed for six weeks, stops all feeding by 
the mouth, if the condition of the patient will permit it, especially after 
hsematemesis, and resorts to rectal feeding. He allows the patient 
to suck bits of ice, and the mouth to be washed out frequently by a 
plain or aerated water. After a few days, guided by the state of the 
pulse and subjective feelings of the patient, he begins to give 
nourishment by the mouth. He permits only milk at first, and not 
more than a tumblerful (250 c.c.) for a meal. If there is a necessity 
for more food, the milk is to be mixed with boiled arrowroot or 
maizena, or ground rice, the yolk of one or two eggs, and some 
cream. Later on he gives j pint of Vichy-water before breakfast, 
to wash out the stomach, and increases the diet by adding boiled 
groats for breakfast, and, during the day, thick soups, milk jelly, 
and meat jeUy. After four weeks he experiments with meat in 
the following order: Chicken, fish, pigeon, partridge, and tender 
veal; but red meats are not allowed until after six weeks. From 
this time onward the diet is gradually increased, care being taken 
to avoid crusts of bread, skin, gristle and tendon of meat or fowl, 
seeds of fruit, much salt, also pepper, mustard, or other spices, 
and alcohol. The patient is allowed to get up for a short time 
daily after six weeks, increasing the time day by day, but must con- 
tinue to lie down after meals for several months. 

Barrs of Leeds- says the most essential part of medical treatment 
is complete and prolonged rest in bed; without it, all other means 
fail to cure. He never orders rectal feeding nor a milk diet for 
gastric ulcer. He allows small meals of meat and stale bread, with 
plenty of water. The small bulk is of more importance than the 
kind of food. If it causes pain, he rests the stomach. Only when 
vomiting prevents the consumption of food does he prescribe rectal 
injections of glucose and water or normal saline solution. If there 
has been haematemesis, he allows no food for three or four days, 
excepting 3 or 4 ounces of water at a time to reheve thirst. 
Patients suffering from recent haematemesis are never hungry, and 
they require no food. Three or four days after the cessation of 
bleeding he prescribes meat, eggs, and stale bread, if there is appetite

for them. No patient is allowed to leave her bed until ten days after 
she has been able to take ordinary mixed solid food, not only with- 
out pain, but actually with enjoyment. 

Lenhartz, dissatisfied with rectal feeding, also tried the effect of 
food having a higher nutritive value and greater solidity than that 
usually prescribed, and was satisfied, not onlj- of its safety, but 
that it was more suitable for the condition of hyperchlorhydria 
or the anaemic and enfeebled state of the patient At the Congress 
for Internal Medicine, 1901, he gave an account of his treatment.

The details are as follows: On the first day, even when hgematemesis 
has occurred, the patient receives 7 or 8 ounces of milk (cooled 
by ice) and two raw beaten eggs, in teaspoonful doses. An icebag 
is placed over the stomach, and used continuously for ten to four- 
teen days, to promote contraction, prevent flatulent distension, 
and relieve pain. On the second day, the milk is increased to 
10 ounces. Three raw^ eggs are used, and | ounce of sugar. The 
milk is increased 3 ounces and the eggs one each day until the 
ninth, and the sugar is gradually increased to 2 ounces. At the 
end of a week i pint of milk and six or eight eggs are used; on the 
ninth day the milk is increased to if pints. One and a half ounces 
of raw minced meat are given on the sixth day, and about 3 ounces 
on the seventh. Zwiebach on the eighth, 2 ounces of raw ham 
on the tenth, and after this date half the eggs are cooked, the other 
half given raw. In the third week the patient is put on ordinary 
mixed diet. In the fifth week she is allowed to get up each day, 
and in the sixth w cek she is allowed to go out of doors.

ulcer by an antilytic serum associated with a dry protein diet is

much used by some physicians. In 1908 Hort ^ made a report on 
cases treated by himself. He prescribes absolute rest in bed for 
two or three weeks, uses no drugs by the mouth, and does not allow 
soup, milk, or fish to any of liis cases. The food consists of three or 
four meals of yolk of eggs lightly cooked, chicken panada or 
quenelle, and stale bread in rotation, and 10 ounces of hot water 
at 7 a.m., 11 a.m., and 10 p.m. If the patient progresses favourably, 
the amount of food is doubled on the fifth day; after the seventh day 
lightly cooked pounded meat is given ; and after the fourteenth day 
beef and mutton form the chief part of the dietary. Full diet is 
allowed after three weeks' treatment, but alcohol, soup, tea, coffee, 
and starchy puddings are forbidden for a period of six months. 
The antilytic serum consists of the normal serum of the horse, 
given in doses of 10 c.c. three times a day by the mouth for three 
weeks; in severe cases a dose of 20 to 30 c.c. is given. It is claimed 
that the ulcer is healed rapidly by this method. There is an early 
cessation of pain, vomiting, and bleeding, and a higher level of 
nutrition is reached than can be obtained by older methods. In a 
lecture given at a later date, Hort^ divided his cases into those 
with and without haemorrhage. 

1. Cases without Bleeding. — Hort considers rest in bed unnecessary 
except for a few days. The object of treatment is to produce the maximum 
state of nutrition as rapidly as possible. To attain this end lie prescribes the 
following meals : 

Breakfast. — Toast, butter, and eggs. 

1 1 a.m. — Raw-beef juice, 2 or 3 ounces. 

Lunch, I p.m. — Beef, mutton, or lamb, lightly cooked, tender, and served 
in the gravy; one or two rusks and butter. The amount is regulated only 
by the appetite. No other food is allowed. 

Tea. — The same as breakfast. 

Dinner, 7 p.m. — The same as lunch. 

g p.m. — Raw-meat juice, 2 or 3 ounces. 

Night. — Sandwiches of pounded chicken or game. 

The dietary is continued for one month. The food is eaten dry. 
He forbids milk, tea, coffee, wine, spirits, soup, beef-tea, potatoes, 
vegetables, farinaceous foods, puddings, cheese, and in many cases 
withdraws bread and rusks. 

2. C.\SES WITH Bleeding — First Day. — Chicken jelly, two or three tea- 
spoonfuls every three hours alternately with half the yolk of a soft-boiled egg. 
Cold water, i ounce occasionally to relieve thirst. If chicken jelly causes 
pain, he replaces it by i ounce of fresh -meat juice of double the ordinary 
strength. 

Second Day. — Three or four teaspoonfuls of chicken panada, alternately 
with raw-meat juice or the yolk of soft-boiled egg, every two and a half hours 
in the day and every four hours at night. 

Third Day. — A larger amount of pounded chicken, pounded meat, and 3'olk 
of eggs, alternately every three hours. Hot water, 5 ounces, sipped slowly 
an hour before meals. The dietary afterwards is that of non-ha;morrhagic cases. 

The experimental observations of Bolton are against the use of 
meat in the treatment of gastric ulcer. The animals were cats, 
and the substance used for producing the ulcer consisted of a 

1 Brit. Med. Jour., 1908, ii. 1081. 2 H)id., 1910, ii. 1904. 



312 DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

gastro-toxic scrum obtained by immunizing a goat with the gastric 
cells of a cat. Two diets were selected for the observations. When 
the animal was led on meat, so that the walls of the stomach were 
exposed to the prolonged action of gastric juice, a slough rapidly 
formed and separated in four days, leaving a clean ulcer. When the 
animals were fed with milk, a longer period intervened before 
the separation of the slough and formation of an ulcer. In two cases 
it did not separate until the eighth day, and in two others it had not 
separated when the animal was killed on the eleventh day. There 
is no doubt that this was due to the influence of the gastric con- 
tents. The same cause prevented or delayed the healing of the 
ulcer. After the slough separates, the base of the ulcer is formed 
of the muscular coat or subperitoneal tissue inhltrated with cells. 
Towards the end of the second week the deeper layers of the base 
became fibrous, and the peritoneum thickened, the superficial layers 
being formed of granulation tissue. At the end of the third week 
the whole base is formed of fibrous tissue, in which strands of 
muscular tissue are seen. Until the epithelium has grown over the 
base, the most superficial layer is formed of vascular and cellular 
tissue. '1 he mucous membrane is regenerated by the layer of cells 
upon the surface of the ulcer. This consists at first of a single layer 
of cubical cells, the glands appearing at first as invaginations of the 
cubical cells. But there is a difference in the mode of healing in 
cats fed with milk and those fed with meat. In milk-fed cats the 
layer of epithelial cells has extended a little way over the base of 
the ulcer by the tenth or eleventh day; but in meat-fed animals 
this does not occur until the thirteenth or fourteenth day. In 
milk-fed animals the base of the ulcer was covered by the twentieth 
day; but in meat-fed animals a large area in the centre remained 
urxovered. Bolton^ drew the following conclusions: 

1. The gastric juice plays a considerable part in the production 
of the ulcer; ulceration is more rapidl}- produced in the digesting 
than in the resting stomach, and in the digesting stomach more 
rapidly in pioportion as the gastric juice is a longer period in contact 
with the wall of the stomach. 

2. The ulcer heals more rapidly with a milk diet than with a 
meat diet. With a milk diet the base of the ulcer is usually com- 
pletely covered by the twentieth day, but with a meat diet the 
centre of the same sized ulcer would be uncovered at the same time. 

3. In meat-fed animals the base of the ulcer is frequently un- 
covered on the twentieth day, the granulation tissue at the base of 
the ulcer having become necrotic. Such an ulcer, however, may 
only be one-fifth its original size, owing to contraction of the fibrous 
tissue in the base, although the heahng process at the edge has only 
commenced. 

4. In the treatment of an ulcer of the stomach the following 
principles should be observed: 

(flj During the early stages the patient should be given food 

^ Brit. Med. Jour., 1910, ii. 19O5. 



DUODENAL ULCER 313 

which docs not stay long in the stomach, and which does not excite 
a copious flow of gastric juice; milk in preference to maat. 

[b] The patient should be conlined to bed for at least three weeks. 

\c) The starvation diet of the older physicians is not necessary, 
because the nutrition suffers too much, and because ulcers heal 
well on diets such as the above. 

{d) In the case of acute ulcers which are extending, and in chronic 
ulcers, it cannot be expected that healing will take place in three 
weeks. The ulcer must first be got into a condition for healing, and 
the rest in bed must be twice as long. 

(6') Since a condition of hyperacidity exists in many cases of 
gastric ulcer, and this hyperacidity has a destructive tendency, 
it should be neutrahzed by the administration of alkalies. This is 
not so necessary in acute ulcers as in the chronic form, because 
the secretion is not hyperacid during the acute stage. When an 
eicute ulcer is experimentally produced, the secretion is diminished in 
the early stages, but the secretion becomes normal as the ulcer heals. 

The Treatment of Duodenal Ulcer is the same as that of gastric 
ulcer, and no further reference would be necessary except for the 
dogma promulgated by Moynihan that whenever there is a duodenal 
ulcer an operation is necessary. This dogma fails to meet universal ac- 
ceptance, although gastro-cnterostomy will cure or relieve the disease. 
Smith, Hort, and other physicians assert its curability without the 
aid of surgery. Hort^ says we know absolutely nothing of the 
essential nature of duodenal ulcer, but the problem whether it is 
a disease siii generis or a mere symptom of a general disease has a 
direct bearing on surgical intervention. If it be a local disease, 
universal excision of the ulcer or of a cylinder of the duodenum, as 
urged by Moynihan and his followers, would be on a similar footing 
to the removal of a lipoma. If, on the other hand, it is a symptom 
of a general disease, as yet unidentified, it assumes a different aspect. 
Ulcer of the duodenum is often multiple, and associated with secon- 
dary ulcers in the stomach, (Esophagus, tongue, gums, or cheeks ; 
it has an inveterate tendency to recur through a long series of years, 
and there is hardly any toxgemic condition in which it may not 
occur as a purely symptomatic event. What can all this mean 
but that the ulcer or ulcers of the duodenum are a local expression 
of some dyscrasia ? If this is correct, the mere excision of the 
local lesion cannot cure the disease. It is as if by amputating the 
foot with a perforating ulcer we could eliminate the spirochsete, 
restore the trophic neurons, and prevent recurrence of ulcer in the 
opposite foot. So long as the unknown cause of the ulcer exists, 
the ulcer will tend to recur. The meat diet of Hort has already 
been given. He says ^ the rationale of his treatment is as follows: 

I. If duodenal ulcer is a symptom and not a disease, the absorp- 
tion of an adequate amount of protein of a suitable form cannot 
but increase the resistance of the body to the unknown cause, and 
assist local repair. 

^ Uiit. Med. Jour., 1910, i. 76-78. 



314 DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

2. If protein food is presented to a case of ulcer in which we know 
the digestive fluids exliibit a high degree of peptic and tryptic 
activity, some of the pepsin and trypsin molecules will be saturated 
with the protein. If now, at the height of digestion, we add a 
serum having a high antipepsin and antitrypsin content, some of 
the unsatished pepsin and trypsin molecules will combine there- 
with, and thus shield the ulcer from those bodies. 

3. If an ulcer is constantly bathed in a secretion laden with pro- 
teolytic ferments set free by disintegrated leucocytes, other cells, 
and bacteria, the antitryptic and other inhibitory bodies of the 
seiiim cannot fail to have a beneficial value, in the same way as 
dressing a superficial ulcer bathed in a highly tryptic pus with sterile 
gauze soaked in normal senmi. 

Cancer of the Stomach. 

The state of nutrition in cancer of the stomach is illustrative of 
the condition which appertains to this disease in other parts of the 
body. It has long been known that little or no free hydrochloric 
acid is found in the carcinomatous stomach. But in 1905 Moore, 
Koaf, and their collaborateurs showed that the free HCl is absent 
or diminished in nearl}- all cases of cancer. They also found that 
the alkahnity of the blood-plasma was increased in such cases, to 
which cause they attributed the reduction in the acid-secreting 
power of the stomach. In the light of the researches of Pawlow, 
Bayliss, and Starhng, the hypochlorhydria in cases of cancer is 
not merel}' of academic interest. In it may be found a rational ex- 
planation of the profound disturbance of nutrition which is such a 
common result of cancer. Each stage of digestion is promoted by 
the activit}- of the previous secretion. The importance, therefore, 
of sufiicient hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice becomes obvious. 
In its absence the secretion of pancreatic juice, bile, and succus 
cntericus, and their share of digestion, is deficient. In the hght of 
these facts the distaste for food, the failure of nutrition, and the 
emaciation, which are marked features in cancerous disease, may be 
accounted for; although it is possible that they could be explained 
by the presence in the blood of a toxin elaborated by the cancerous 
growth; but the existence of such a toxin has not been proved. 
The increased alkalinity of the blood-plasma has been attributed 
to an increase in the salts of potassium, and by other authorities 
to a diminution in the amount of free H ions in the circulating fluids. 
The failure of nutrition results in a steady and progressive destruction 
of tissue proteins to supply energy. This is especially noticeable 
in cancer of the stomach or (Esophagus, when only a small amount 
of food can be got through the stomach. Even when rectal feeding 
with eggs, peptone, and glucose is resorted to, there is a considerable 
increase of nitrogen metabolism, due to destruction of tissues. 

Treatment. — The dietetics of cancer of the stomach, as in other 
parts of the body, presents considerable difficulty. The diet must 
be arranged as far as possible to promote the nutrition of the body 



CANCER OF THE STOMACH 315 

and check the emaciation. In view of the deticiency of free hydro- 
chloric acid, it is desirable that all patients should be given a 
medicinal dose of hydrochloric acid with each meal. A beverage 
can be made by mixing the acid in plain water or lemon-water. 

(i) When the cancer affects the oesophagus or cardiac end of the 
stomach, the food should consist of milk, raw eggs, meat essences 
or extracts, Leube's soluble meat, strong soup, finely minced meat, 
chicken or fish cream, potato puree, vegetable consomme, fine oat- 
meal, arrowroot, and other farinaceous foods (Benger's, Allenbury's, 
Savory and Moore's, Mellin's), dextrin or dextrose, in sufficient 
quantity to provide for the maintenance of the body. Four pints 
of milk, 2 ounces of fine oatmeal or corn-meal, 2 ounces of arrowroot 
or dextrin, i ounce of sugar, i ounce of butter or an equivalent 
amount of cream, form a dietary which will yield 2,217 calories. 
This is little short of the amount required for hght work or sedentary 
occupation. When dysphagia is marked, the patient should be 
fed three times a day by means of an oesophageal tube, about 
1 2 pints of food being poured down at each meal. So long as it is 
possible to pass even a small tube, the patient should be fed in this 
manner. When it becomes impossible, rectal feeding must be 
resorted to. Sometimes, after intermitting gastric feeding for a 
few days, a tube can again be passed through the gullet, and the 
patient fed as before. 

(2) When the cancer is in the stomach, but affects neither aperture, 
the patient may be allowed free choice of food, because, from the 
nature of the disease, his life will not be long. The cravings of such 
persons are often remarkable, and, provided the food can easily 
get in and out of the stomach, no restriction of the diet is necessary. 
At the same time it is wise to direct the appetite in the right direc- 
tion. The diminution of hydrochloric acid and the gastric catarrh 
suggest a dietary similar to that for hypochlorhydria {q.v.). 

(3) When the pylorus is affected, but not obstructed, a mixed 
protein and carbohydrate diet should be prescribed, and may 
include milk, eggs, scraped meat, pounded chicken or fish, Leube's 
solution of meat, kephir, koumiss, junket, custard, Benger's food, 
MeUin's food, biscuit powder, boiled bread and milk, arrowroot 
jelly, and other farinaceous foods, and mashed potato. Many of 
these foods can be peptonized or pancreatized if necessary. 

When the pylorus is obstructed, the diet should contain much pro- 
tein and little carbohydrate. Mellin's food, being almost entirely 
soluble, may be given; but bread, potatoes, vegetables, arrowroot, 
cornflour, rusks, biscuits, oatmeal, and all other farinaceous foods 
should be forbidden; they cannot be digested in the stomach, and 
their passage into the bowels is hindered. If they are consumed, 
they will cause flatulence and acidity, increase of pain, fulness, 
belching, regurgitation, and vomiting. Milk should be the basis 
of the dietary. Some glucose or dextrin can be used, but not in 
very great quantity. To these may be added eggs, oysters, meat, 
fish or chicken creams, meat pastes, meat powders, meat extracts, 
milk powders, junket, custard, and jell>-. A dietary consisting of 



5i('-> DISEASES OF THE STO^fACH 

4 pints of milk, two raw eggs, and 8 ounces of meat, lish, or chicken, 
will contain about 146 gramme>of available protein, 105 grammes of 
fat, and 108 grammes of carbohydrate, and yield 2,500 calorics of 
heat or energy. The carbohydrates prescribed will pass through the 
pylorus if anything will go. The fat is chiefly the fat of milk and 
eggs, and, being already emulsified, should have no difficulty in 
passing through a pylorus which is not completely blocked up. 
Difficulty may arise from the formation of milk curds, but this can 
be prevented by the addition of 2 grains of citrate of soda to an 
ounce of milk; it is also obviated by making milk into kephir, junket, 
or custard. Six or eight eggs may be taken daily if they agree 
with the patient. The preparation of meat is the most difficult 
matter. A considerable amount of trouble is required to reduce 
it to the proper consistence. Raw meat can be put through a 
mincer, and cooked meat reduced by beating it in a mortar with a 
pestle. Chicken and fish are reduced by cutting them into very 
thin shces, beating them to a pulp in a mortar, and adding a little 
cream or stock to moisten it. It should not be forgotten that 
absorption from the stomach, never very great, is reduced when 
the obstruction is marked, and in all cases free hydrochloric acid 
is deficient. The use of pancreatized or peptonized foods is helpful. 
Peptonized milk, Carnrich's peptonoids, Leube's meat solution, 
somatose, nutrose, panapepton, Brand's nutrient powder. Brand's 
essence of beef, Valentine's meat juice, raw-meat juice, milk fortified 
by cream, casein, or dried milk, and various other preparations, 
can be used. 

In hgemorrhagic cases the patient should be fed entirely by the 
rectum for a few days after the cessation of bleeding, and even in 
non-bleeding cases it is advisable to give the stomach a few days' 
rest occasionally, and resort to rectal feeding {q.v.). 

One or two dietaries from other sources may be given as examples. 
In early cases of carcinoma of the stomach Biedert recommends 
the following dietary, having a value of 2,300 calories: 

6 a.m. — Milk, a breakfast -cupful ; toast, i ounce. 
S a.m. — Eggs, two; toast, i ounce. 

10 a.m. — Cream, 4 ounces; zwiebach, two pieces. 

Noo)i. — Meat, 5 ounces ; toast, i J ounces ; cinnamon cake, soda cake, coffee 
cake, or biscuit, i ounce. 

4 p.m. — Milk-cocoa, a breakfast -cupful ; zwiebach, two pieces; fruit jelly. 

7 p.m. — Rice-milk; zwiebach, two pieces. 

10 p.m. — Milk, a breakfast -cupful; zwiebach, two pieces. 

Wegele recommends for non-obstructed cases: 

Morning. — Malt-leguminose cocoa, a breakfast -cupful. 
Forenoon. — Kephir, a tumblerful. 

Noon. — Malt-leguminose soup, ^ pint; scraped beef, 3^ ounces. 
Afternoon. — Malt-leguminose cocoa, a breakfast -cupful. 
Evening. — Scraped ham, 3^ ounces; tapioca, 5 ounces. 
10 p.m. — Kephir, a tumblerful. 

During the Day. — -Toast, 2 ounces; honey, i ounce (in cocoa); cognac 
I ounce (in kephir). 
The entire dietary has a value of about 1,260 calories. 



CANCER or THE STOMACH 317 

The general treatment of cancer of the stomach is that of re- 
lieving pain, acidity, vomiting, flatulence, and constipation. Pain 
and vomiting arc often due to acidity and distension. Antiseptic 
or disinfecting powders may be given to check fermentation, putre- 
faction, and flatulence. Flatulence may be relieved by a judicious 
mixture of cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, or fennel with the food. 
Lavage of the stomach is useful in p^'loric cases by removing the 
micro-organisms responsible for fermentation and distension. 
Constipation may be relieved by enemata, saline aperient waters, 
cascara, etc. 

When obstruction of the (esophagus or pylorus becomes so great 
that gastric feeding is more or less impossible, the advisability of 
an operation will have to be considered. In the meantime rectal 
and subcutaneous feeding have to be resorted to. Sterilized olive 
or sesame oil can be injected into various subcutaneous areas in 
doses of 3 drachms once a day, but the futility of this proceed- 
ing as a means of maintaining nutrition is obvious. When the 
cesophagus is obstructed, the operation of gastrostomy, to provide a 
fistulous opening through which food may be introduced into the 
stomach, is recommended. 

When the pylorus is obstructed, gastro-enterostomy should be 
performed to provide a new stoma. By these means considerable 
suffering may be avoided and the life of the patient prolonged some 
months. This leads us to consider the digestion of foods after such 
an operation. The following information is largely drawn from 
an article on the subject by Hector C. Cameron:^ Paw'low, Bayliss, 
and Starling have shown that digestion is a continuous operation, 
and does not consist of isolated reactions. An adequate secretion 
of pancreatic fluid depends upon the normal changes of the food 
during gastric digestion. Therefore the stability of the digestive 
process is impaired by short-circuiting the duodenum — a link in 
the chain is broken ! Joslin showed that the digestion of fats and 
proteins was impaired by the operation of gastro-enterostomy. If 
there is no pvloric obstruction, the food still continues to leave the 
stomach by the p^-loric opening. If there is a pyloric obstruction, 
it leaves by the anastomotic opening. If the pyloric valve is not 
absolutely obstructed, as soon as free acid accumulates in the 
stomach, the pyloric valve relaxes, and a squirt of acid chyme 
passes through it. Pawlow says this regulating action prevents a 
disorder of the digestive process, and insures regularity in the 
transition from the acid gastric to the alkahne intestinal digestion 
If, however, the acid contents of the stomach pass without control 
through the anastomosis into the duodenum, the bile, by mixing 
with the gastric contents, might arrest or weaken the action of 
pepsin; and an insufficient reduction of acidity would interfere 
with the pancreatic ferments. A regurgitation of the alkaline 
duodenal juice is also likely to occur. In consequence of this 
mixture of secretions, the hydrochloric acid digestion will a priori

RF.CTAI, FEEDING 319 

be impaired; and, in tnrn, the diminished or abolished acidity will 
diminish tlie production of secretin in the duodenal mucous mem- 
brane, and the pancreatic secretion will fail. But a study of the 
absorption of food after these operations show that the effect is 
not very deleterious to digestion. 

When milk is consumed by a healthy person, the amount of 
protein absorbed averages about 97 per cent., and the fat varies 
from 92 to 98 per cent, of the total. After gastro-enterostomy, 
the absorption is not so complete, but varies with the condition; 
thus, in non-malignant cases it sinks to 91 or 92 per cent, of protein, 
as compared with an average of 97 per cent in health, and 92 or 
94 per cent, of fat as compared with 95 per cent, in health. In 
carcinoma of the stomach or pylorus the absorption of protein 
sinks to 80-87 per cent., and the fat to 67-81 per cent. This is 
shown in the table on p. 318. 

Hector C. Cameron^ also gives particulars of the absorption of 
food after gastro-enterostomy, the diet being milk or mixed food 
consisting of butter 3 ounces, bread, eggs, fish, vegetables, milk, 
cream, tea, sugar. 

The conclusion derived from these observations is that the 
operation is not only harmless, but even beneficial, by permitting 
a greater consumption of food. In non-malignant cases there is 
a slight diminution in the absorption of fat from a purely milk 
diet after gastro-enterostomy, partly attributable to a diminution 
of rennin. The secretion of pepsin and rennin are both somewhat 
impaired. When a mixed diet rich in fat (chiefly butter) is given, 
the diminution of digestion and absorption of fat disappears to some 
extent. With either milk or mixed diet the digestion is the same, 
whether an obstruction of the pylorus is present or not In ma- 
hgnant obstruction of the pylorus, the operation of gastro-jejunos- 
tomy and partial gastrectomy is followed by almost complete power 
of dealing with the fat. The digestion and absorption of a mixed 
diet is performed with a comparatively small diminution of the 
normal percentage of absorption. 

Rectal Feeding. 

Artificial feeding is a necessity in certain conditions in which it 
is desirable or imperative to suspend gastric feeding. Ulcer of the 
stomach and duodenum stand out prominently among the cases 
in which this mode of treatment is considered necessary; it is also 
a useful adjunct to other treatment in some cases of gastric dilata- 
tion, gastric neurosis, pyloric obstruction, uncontrollable vomiting 
in pregnancy, and acute gastric catarrh after abdominal operations; 
in typhoid fever, meningitis, apoplexy, diabetic coma, and other 
comatose conditions. 

Useful as rectal feeding is in such cases, we must not delude 
ourselves by thinking that the nutritive requirements of the system 

1 Brit. Med, Juur., 1908, i. i43-4.<. 



320 DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

can be satisfied by this mode of feeding. There are hmits to the 
absorptive power of the intestinal niueous membrane, and these 
hmits are mueh narrowir than foinurly supposed. It is impossible 
to inject foods sufhciently high into the colon to insure the absorp- 
tion of a large amount of nutriment from its surface. Patients 
often feel better during rectal feeding because, oral feeding being 
stopped, the cause of gastric irritation is removed. But a careful 
record of the metabolism during rectal feeding shows a constant 
loss of weight, the nitrogenous equilibrium is not maintained; on 
the other hand, there is a nitrogen deficit, in consequence of which 
the tissue proteins disintegrate, and part of the excreted nitrogen is 
from that source. Wynter said: " Nutrient enemata satisfy the 
mind rather than the body." The}- remove the sense of hunger, 
relieve the mental anxiet}' consequent upon starvation, and in 
some cases apparently maintain the body in moderate nutrition. 
These effects may arise from the psychical influence resulting from 
the use of nutritive materials, and very largel}' from the absorption 
of water and salts in the colon. The patient wastes, not merely 
from absence of food, but from the loss of water; and the absorption 
of water from the intestinal canal prevents the loss of weight. 
Rectal feeding is at the best a poor substitute for normal gastric 
feeding; the patient is in a condition of subnutrition or semi-star- 
vation, and in some cases a decided acidosis arises from tissue de- 
struction and failure to oxidize the fatty acids, and this gives rise 
to acetonuria and more or less auto-intoxication. 

It is necessary to inquire into the extent of absorption of the 
various foodstuffs from the lower bowel. This has been done by 
numerous investigators, and an endeavour is made to show the 
results of some of the observations in the following table. The 
method of investigation consists of injecting into the previously 
washed out bowel enemata containing a known quantity of the 
proximate principles of food; the residue is removed at the next 
cleansing, and the amount of the proximate principles in it ascer- 
tained. The difference between the two is assumed to be absorbed. 
Each class of materials is separately considered. Voit, Bauer, 
Ewald, and Huber are among the earlier observers. Their work 
was valuable, but modern research has shown that the value set 
upon rectal feeding by them was much too high. 

Absorption of Protein.^ — Arnim Huber, who investigated the 
absorption b}- the rectal mucous membrane of human subjects, 
found that from emulsified eggs 29-8 to 36 per cent, of protein was 
absorbed. When i per cent, of NaCl was added, 69-5 to 70 per 
cent, was absorbed; and when the egg was peptonized, 747 to 
76-6 per cent of the protein was absorbed. But Edsall and Miller, 
Boyd and Robertson, were unable to confirm this observation, 
their results are given in table on p. 321. 

The best absorption of raw eggs and milk was 21-5 per cent., 
recorded by Boyd and Robertson; the best absorption of peptonized 
milk and egg 47 per cent., recorded by Edsall and Miller. When milk 



RECTAL FEEDING 



321 



powders were used, an absorption of 40 to 82 per cent, has been 
recorded. When peptones or albumoses were used, Sharkey* 
found from 50 to 75 per cent., or a total of 51 grammes, absorbed in 
twent\'-four hours. If this is correct, it is possible that more pro- 
tein can be absorbed than appeared probable from the table. Edsall 
and .Miller endeavoured to ascertain this point by estimating the 
amount of ethereal sulphates in the urine after rectal feeding. 
Ethereal sulphates in the urine are increased in proportion to the 
amount of putrefaction of protein by bacteria in the intestines. 
These observers found the excretion of ethereal sulphates after 
feeding with peptones and albumoses to be excessive; indeed, it 
was two or three times as much as the normal excretion. This 
fact alone places the figures relative to the absorption of proteins 
at a fictitiously high value. The consideration of the nitrogenous 
equilibrium shows that, even under the most favourable circum- 
stances, this cannot be maintained by rectal feeding, and that such 
ahmentation falls far short of the minimum requirements of the 
system, and necessitates the destruction of the tissue proteins of 
the organism to make up the deficiency.

Absorption of Fat. — Various investigators report the absorption 
of different amounts. Aldor found that one person absorbed 
33 per cent, of the fat of milk, but another only 15 per cent.; 
Strauss found 10 per cent, absorbed; Edsall and 5liller found 136 
and 33 "4 per cent, absorbed by two different people. Bo^^d and 
Robertson found the absorption varied from 3-47 to 45 85 grammes 
per day in different people: Edsall and Miller found from 648 to 1587 
grammes absorbed daily. Deucher made investigations which led 
him to suppose that only 10 grammes of fat were absorbed per day 
through the mucous membrane of the colon, even with the addition

of salt, and allowing it to remain a long tima in the bowel. Ham- 
burger found the absorption of fat was facilitated when it was 
injected into animals in the form of an emulsion or solution of 
soap. Munk and Rosenstein made observations in a person who 
had a fistula into the thoracic duct. The injection of fat into the 
bowel increased the amount in. the chyle, but the increase only 
indicated an absorption of 35 to 57 per cent. Boyd and Robert- 
son consider the fat absorbed in this way is a protein-sparer, the 
loss of nitrogen being greater when the absorption of fat was poor. 

Absorption of Carbohydrates. — It appears from thj observations of 
numerous ])oop]e that sugar disappears from the colon quickly, starch 
more slowly, and only in part. Deucher gave 200 grammes of sugar 
daily, and found 77 per cent, absorbed; Zehmisch gave 152 grammes, 
cuid found 67 per cent, absorbed; Sharkey gave 34 grammes, 
and found j8 per cent, absorbed. Boyd and Robertson used pure 
glucose, and found 90 per cent, absorbed. Strauss considers that 
40 to 50 grammes of pure glucose in a 10 or 20 per cent, solution can 
be absorbed daily, and patients can be maintained in a good con- 
dition with it for two or three months. Reach found dextrin to 
be absorbed better than sugar. 

The question has to be asked. What becomes of the sugar ? Is 
it absorbed or split by fermentation ? It is possible that a great 
amount of the sugar injected into the intestine is destroyed by 
bacterial action, and therefore is not absorbed. To ascertain its 
value as a nutrient enema. Reach ^ watched its effect on the res- 
piratory quotient. When carbohydrate was given by the mouth, 
he observed the usual increase in the respiratory quotient, but 
the same carbohydrate given as a nutrient enema had little or no influ- 
ence on the respiratory quotient, from which he concluded that the 
proportion of sugar absorbed by the mucous membrane was con- 
siderably less than when it was taken by the mouth. When Boyd 
and Robertson inoculated a solution of glucose with Bacillus coli 
communis, or bowel contents, less than i per cent, of sugar was 
destroyed during a period of four hours at the temperature of the 
body. They concluded, therefore, that the amount of sugar 
destroyed in the bowel by bacterial action was of little importance; 
that the bulk of the sugar which disappears from the bowel is really 
absorbed, and the absorption amounts to 89, or even 100, per cent, 
of glucose. In face of the evidence cited we cannot draw definite 
conclusions as to the value of glucose as a nutrient enema. Further 
investigation of its effect on the respiratory quotient would prob- 
ably confirm or destroy the deductions of Reach or Boyd and 
Robertson. Until evidence is at hand which proves it to be of no 
value, a 10 or 20 per cent, solution of glucose should be used as a 
constituent of rectal feeds. Care should be exercised in the choice 
of the material to be used. Commercial glucose may contain 
traces of arsenic or sulphuric acid, which would irritate the mucous 
membrane, and ultimately lead to its ejection. Pure glucose should

be used, and the addition of }, to i grain of menthol or thymol par 
ounce will prc\^ent fermentation. It has been found that this com- 
bination can be used for weeks together without causing irritation. 

Absorption of Salts. — Various inorganic salts are absorbed by 
the mucous membrane of the colon, provided they are not injected 
in a too concentrated form, and are not of a nature to induce irrita- 
tion. The addition of NaCl in the proportion of i per cent, is 
valuable by assisting the solution and absorption of proteins; even 
fat and carbohydrates are absorbed more readily when it is present. 
It is considered that salt induces antiperistalsis of the colon 
whereby the injected material is carried backward as far as the 
ileo-oecal valve, or even through this sphincter into the ileum. If 
this is really the case, it affords an explanation of those cases in 
which nutrition is said to have been maintained by rectal feeding 
for weeks or months, for the absorption of nutrients from the 
mucous membrane of the ileum is undoubtedly greater than that 
from the colon. But the value of common salt is not universally 
admitted. This leads to the question of vomiting. The vomiting 
due to an ulcer of the stomach, gastric dilatation, or pyloric obstruc- 
tion, usually ceases when nothing at all is given by the mouth, and 
especially when cessation of gastric feeding is combined with 
physiological rest of the body. This is aided by the body being 
scrupulously kept still, turning in bed or shaking the bedstead 
being a\oided. S<)metimes, however, vomiting continues in spite 
of rest and cessation of gastric feeding, and it has been attributed 
to reflex action due to rectal feeding, and especially to the use of 
sail in the enemata. The state of the mouth, it is true, especially 
pyorrhfea alveolaris, may cause persistent vomiting if the discharge 
and microbes are swallowed. When the vomiting is persistent, the 
local application of m.ustard, iodine, or turpentine, to the epigastrium 
may be tried; or small particles of ice or dilute hydrocyanic acid 
may be given internally. In rare cases the vomiting does not 
cease until rectal feeding is omitted. In such a ca.se one must, of 
course, return to oral feeding, beginning to treat an ulcer of the 
stomncli on the lines previously indicated. 

Conclusion. — A certain amount of nutriment can be introduced 
into the system by rectal feeding, but under the most favourable 
conditions such a mode of feeding results in a condition of decided 
subnutrition. The amount of protein from raw eg^ and milk 
which can be absorbed is really small; that from peptonized milk 
and Qgg or peptone is better. Little fat is absorbed, but the carbo- 
hydrates, especially glucose and dextrin, are well absorbed. Boyd 
and Robertson ^ showed that the average amount of albumin ab- 
sorbed was one-sixth of that injected, of fat one-third, and of 
carbohydrate nine-tenths. The daily value of the food absorbed 
varied from 240 to 645 calories, or an average of 390 calories. This 
is about one-sixth the nutriment required by a person whose me- 
tabolism is at a low level. Indeed, while rectal feeding alone is

tontiiUR'tl, WL- inu^t expect progressive loss of weight, destriKtion 
of tissue proteins, and sometimes aeidosis.^ We cannot, thereiore, 
relv upon this mode of feeding to improve nutrition, but rather 
to support the body somewhat during a period of functional rest 
of the stomach. In such cases it is of service, particularly when 
the enemata consist of predigested proteins, or solutions of peptones 
and albumoses not exceeding lo per cent, concentration, with 
emulsified fat — in the form of milk or yolk of egg, carbohydrates, 
such as pure glucose or dextrin, up to lo per cent, concentration, 
and common salt, in the proportion of i per cent. The addition of 
a little alcohol is also useful; it is held by some that it facilitates 
the absorption of protein and glucose; it should not form more 
than o"5 or 2 per cent, of the injection. The enemata should be 
siphoned into the bowel by a soft rubber catheter with a long tube 
and a small funnel. The amount of each feed should not exceed 
8 or 10 ounces (250 to 300 c.c.) ; more than that would render its 
retention difficult. In this way the injected nutrients may have a 
value of 2,000 calories, but not more than 25 per cent., or 500 calories, 
will be absorbed. Examples of the enemata in use are as follows: 

1. Singer recommends one raw egg well beaten, 15 grains of salt, 
milk 5 ounces. Ewald recommends the milk to be peptonized. 

2. Huber" recommends six raw eggs, to be mixed with 90 grains 
(6 giammes) of salt; add 7 ounces of dilute hydrochloric acid (o"i5 
per cent.), containing 75 grains of pepsin. Place the mixture in a 
warm chamber for ten hours.

CHAPTER X 
DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES 

Intestinal Indigestion and Auto-Intoxication. 

The processes of digestion and absorption have been described 
in previous chapters. To insure digestion and absorption taking 
place in a normal manner, there must be complete harmony between 
the organs concerned. Failure in the performance of a function 
by the stomach, liver, pancreas, or bowels, will be followed by de- 
rangement of the others. Primary intestinal indigestion is due 
to a deficiency in the quantity or quality of the intestinal, hepatic, 
or pancreatic secretions, or some disease of the intestinal mucosa. 
Secondary' intestinal indigestion arises from chronic intestinal 
catarrh, such as commonly follows the passive congestion due to 
diseases of the heart, hver, or lungs. It may also arise from irregu- 
larities in feeding, atony of the stomach, h3-pochlorhydria, and 
even from hyperchlorhydria. Excessive acidit}' checks pancreatic 
digestion; the activity of trypsin is hindered, the absorption of fat 
delayed, and the due transformation of carbohydrates prevented. 
Deficiency in the pancreatic secretion has a similar effect; a con- 
siderable proportion of the protein is unassimilated, and fat leaves 
the body in the faeces. Deficiency of bile leads to lessened absorp- 
tion of fat, constipation, clay-coloured stools, and catarrh of the 
bowels. Fermentation occurs as a consequence of these defects. 
The normal gastric juice is disinfectant, but even in health this 
influence only extends to the duodenum. Bile is also antiseptic. 
The pancreatic fluid, on the other hand, is favourable to the action 
of bacteria. Indeed, it is difficult to say where the action of pan- 
creatic fluid ends and that of bacteria begins. Many intestinal 
bacteria have a diastatic and proteolytic action, somewhat similar 
to that of the pancreatic secretion; but their action goes farther. 
Lactic acid bacteria, of which there are many kinds, are intro- 
duced into the body with milk, cheese, or butter, and transform 
saccharose, lactose, and dextrose into lactic acid. Butyric acid 
bacteria, several kinds of which are also introduced with the food, 
transform cane-sugar and lactic acid into butyric acid, hj'drogen, 
and COg. Yeast transfoims dextrose into alcohol, succinic acid, 
and glycerine. Mycodetma aceii and other micro-organisms trans- 
form carbohydrates and alcohol into acetic acid, water, and COg. 
Cther bacteria, split fats into fatty acids and glycerine, and some 

326 



iNTFSTrN.iL lynTGEsrroN 327 

fatty acids into butyric and valeric acids. Putrefactive organisms 
transform proteins into fatty acids and amino-acids — e.g., leucin. 
tyrosin, indol. skatol; aromatic bodies — e.g., plienol and cresol; 
purin bodies —xanthin, hypoxantliin, p^uanin, and adenin; pto- 
maines, such as ncurin, cholin, muscarin, cadavcrin, peptotoxin, 
putrescin, and saprin; ammonia, compounds of ammonia, salts of 
potash, sulphuric acid, methyl mercaptan, and sulphuretted hy- 
dr(\t,'fii. These substances cause — 

Auto-Intoxication. — The fact that auto-intoxication arising from 
these causes is not more common is due (i) to the antagonism of 
the poisons; (2) to the action of the liver, which, in its normal con- 
dition, has the power of destroying, modifying, or eliminating 
some of them; and (3) because some of the poisons are broken down 
into harmless substances. When the neurons undergo degeneration, 
the symptoms of general paralysis are due to neurin and cholin. 
When absorbed from the alimentary canal in frequently repeated 
small doses, neurin and cholin may cause other nervous diseases. 
These poisons arise from the decomposition of various foodstuffs. 
Lecithin, a normal constituent of many cells, is broken down in 
the intestinal tractTby the pancreatic secretion or bv bacteria into 
fatty acid, glycerine, phosphoric acid, and cholin. Neurin is broken 
down to cholin. And cholin is normally broken down to CH4, 
CO2, and ammonia. But if the decomposition of proteins con- 
taining these bodies is incomplete, the neurin and cholin may be 
absorbed unchanged. It is believed that cholin is the chief cause 
of the unpleasant symptoms sometimes arising after the consump- 
tion of fresh or new-laid eggs. Indol, skatol, and phenol, are also 
absorbed from the ahmentary canal. Indol is usually converted 
into indican and excreted by the kidneys; skatol is oxidized to 
skatoxjd, and excreted in the urine as skatoxyl-sulphuric acid. 
These substances form the ethereal sulphates of the urine, and the 
proportion to nitrogen in the urine is a rough measure of the de- 
composition of proteins in the bowels. 

The results of intestinal indigestion are — (i) flatulence and failure 
of nutrition, owing to decomposition of the food; (2) alimentary 
toxaemia from absorption of the products of decomposition. 

Flatulence has been sufficiently discussed. The patient should 
avoid those foods which give rise to it. The carbohydrates must 
temporarily be reduced. Those which commonly give rise to most 
gas are bread, potatoes, and legumes A large proportion of these 
substances is carried down into the ileum, where the alkalinity 
and slow peristalsis favour bacterial growth and fermentation. 
Sago, rice, tapioca, and arrowroot do not give rise to flatulence in 
the same degree — in fact, rice is absorbed almost entirely in the 
upper part of the bowels. It is therefore advisable to recommend 
such people to eat rice, sago, tapioca, arrowroot, and stewed fruits. 
The organic acids of the latter being conveyed into the intestines, 
assist in checking bacterial growth, while thev do not interfere with 
digestion. 



3-."' D!srAsr:s or riii: istfstises 

The acidity of the stomach and heartburn, which frequently 
accompany intestinal in(li,t;estion, are often tn-ated by the adminis- 
tration of alkalies between meals or by drinking water. The latter 
expedient relieves the organic acidity bv diluting the contents of 
the stomach, the former by neutralizing the acidity. But neither 
procedure is a curative measure. Indeed, the administration of 
alkalies between meals favours the growth of bacteria in the 
stomach and bowels, and tends to exaggerate the evil it is sought to 
cure. Alkalies taken before meals may, on the other hand, increase 
the secretion of In'drochloric acid slightly. But the best treatment 
is to forbid eating carbohydrate foods for a few days, and prescribe 
hydrochloric acid to disinfect the stomach, intensify the acidity 
of the chyme, and promote the formation of secretin and secretion 
of pancreatic juice. The dietetic treatment of intestinal flatulence 
and failure of nutrition consists of a combination of meat and milk. 
During the period of one week the patient should take daily 2 pints 
of milk (used as plain milk, custard, junket, or milk jelly), jelly of 
various kinds, and meat, lish, or poultry. After this period rice or 
rice pudding may be allowed, but with very little sugar, or with 
very little spice. If no flatulence follows this addition to the diet, 
some tapioca, sago, or arrowroot mav be allowed next, taking care 
that the sugar is kept at a minimum ; and finally torrefied bread, 
very dry toast, or zwiebach; and, last of all, potatoes. The green 
vegetables, salads, and legumes must be taken sparingly for a long 
time. Kidney or string beans, vegetable marrow, and spinach, 
are probably the least flatulent, and they may be taken first of all. 

The Alimentary Toxaemia arising from intestinal indigestion is fol- 
lowed by more serious consequences. For the sake of avoiding 
repetition, it will be dealt wdth here instead of elsewhere. Auto- 
intoxication arises from (i) the excessive formation of toxins, or 
(2) defective ehmination Toxins arise from protein foods if these 
are taken in excess or in an improper condition, and from torpidity 
or stasis of the contents of the bowels, with subsequent fermentation 
or putrefaction. Toxcemia may arise from atony of the small or 
large intestines, duodenal atony or catarrh, dilatation of the 
stomach, hypochlorhydria, and defective action of the nervous 
system. Defective elimination is due to a failure to oxidize the 
leucomaines and ptomaines arising from the food, or inability to 
ehminate the oxidation products. The modes of elimination are 
as follows: 

1. The liver normally destroys leucomaines, ptomaines, purin 
bodies, and even peptones and albumoses. Its destructive func- 
tions are exceedingly important. Anything which interferes with 
the functions of the liver for any length of time necessarily leads to 
auto-intoxication and serious deterioration of the health. 

2. The kidneys, however, are by far the most important organs 
of elimination. They eliminate two-thirds of the waste solids, 
including urea, uric acid, purin bodies, ethereal sulphates, colouring, 
and mineral matters. 



AI.lM/:.\T.Un- TOX.r.MIA 329 

3. The lungs eliminate various pcjisonous substances, even wlicn 
tlie body is in a normal condition, including a little ammonia, 
marsh gas, and organic volatile bodies, (iermain See experimented 
with a hquid ol:)tained by washing expired air, and found it to be 
l)ois()nous to small animals. If such l^odies are exhaled by the 
lungs when the organism is in a state of health, how much more 
will they be exhaled when the body is diseased ! When the bowels 
are not acting regularly, the lungs excrete a large amount of odori- 
ferous substances belonging to the indol group, which are of a dis- 
tinctly toxic character. It is fortunate that volatile substances 
of this nature diffuse through the air in the lungs and leave the 
body so casilv. 

4. The skin normally eliminates dO.^, a little urea, a small quantity 
of salts, and some volatile fatty acids, which give a characteristic 
odour to certain animals, and even to human beings. It is inter- 
esting to note that fatty acids are eliminated by the skin of hypo- 
chondriacs more freely than that of ordinary human beings. 

A careful study of intestinal auto-intoxication will throw much 
light on the setiology of many chronic and intractable ailments. 
Ptomaines, or substances arising from putrefying bodies, have long 
been recognized as a cause of dangerous illness. But it was not until 
1885, when Gautier demonstrated the poisonous nature of leuco- 
maines and ptomaines, and they were considered of pathological 
interest. Gautier showed that the animal economy is often poisoned 
by its own products — that is, by leucomaines arising during me- 
tabolism. The leucomaines found in fresh muscular tissue are 
xantho-creatinin, cnisco-creatinin, ampho-creatinin, and pseudo- 
creatinin. The ptomaines arise from albuminous bodies during 
putrefaction, and may be divided into two groups: (i) The little 
poisonous — e.g., putrescin, dH^gNo, derived from all kinds of 
albuminoids; neuridin, C5H14N2, from meat; saprin, CsHjgNa, from 
all kinds of albumin; cadaverin, C5H17N2; cholin, CjHijNO.,; 
gadinin, C^Hi-XO.,, from cod-fish. (2) Very poisonous — e.g., 
neurin, CjHj^XO ; muscarin, C5H13NO3 ; peptotoxin ; mydalein ; 
cthylendiamine, CoH,,(XH,,)., ; tyrotoxicon, CgH^No, from decaying 
cheese and ice-cream; mytilotoxin, C7H15XO3. from mussels; 
scombrin, Ci7H3gX4, from mackerel; sardinin, CuH^^XOo, from 
sardines, etc. 

Some products of normal intestinal digestion are poisons of con- 
-^iderable power, and if, through inadequacy of the cells of the in- 
testinal mucous membrane, these poisons reach the circulation in 
a considerable quantity, dangerous, and even alarming, symptoms 
may ensue. The knowledge that the proteins of the food are 
broken down in the intestines into amino-acids, some of which are 
very poisonous, and are taken up by the cells of the mucous mem- 
brane and reconstructed therein into new proteins, places the in- 
testinal mucous membrane on a higher plane of physiological 
importance than it was considered to occupy before the recent 
knowledge of amino-acids was arrived at. 



^^o lUSFASES OF THE INTESTINES 

One of the commonest modes of causing a toxremia is by consti- 
pation or a delay in tlie process of digestion and absorption. The 
longer the contents remain in the ileum and colon, the more oppor- 
tunity is afforded the bacteria to bring about putrefactive changes. 
The slow peristalsis ^vhich occins in atonv of the intestines particu- 
larly favours bacterial action. The commonest symptoms arising 
from such toxaemia are dvspepsia, bilious attacks, constipation, or 
constipation alternating with diarrhoea, foul breath, flatulence, 
headache, vertigo, migraine, neuralgia, pigmentation of the skin 
and conjunctiva, cold hands and feet, etc. The chronic results 
of such toxaemia have been classified as follows: (i) Gout, especially 
the neurotic and so-called " latent " gout; (2) chronic rheumatism, 
and probably rheumatoid arthritis; (3) asthma, chronic bron- 
chitis, wheezing, especially in the obese; (4) vasomotor disturbances, 
cardiac irregularity, cardiac neuroses, false angina, coldness of the 
hands and feet, pseudo-Raynaud's disease; (5) arterio-sclerosis and 
Bright's disease; (6) neurasthenia, migraine, insomnia, hypo- 
chondria, and other forms of mental derangement. 

Gout and chronic rheumatism are probably always associated 
with more or less intestinal auto-intoxication, and in many instances 
are due to this cause. Whether we view gout as being due to an 
excess of animal food, purin bodies, mal-digestion of carbohydrates, 
or imprudent mixing of foods and drink, in each case the toxins 
may be produced in the intestinal canal. Whether we view gout as 
being due to defective action of the kidneys, inactivity of the liver, 
dilatation of the stomach, or want of exercise, the main factor in 
each is excessive formation or defective elimination of the materies 
morbi, arising in the alimentary canal, and therefore an auto- 
intoxication. 

Probabl}' no part of the body is more often affected by the pro- 
ducts arising from protein decomposition in the bowels than the 
bloodvessels. The multitude of toxins arising in the alimentary 
canal have been divided into two classes: (i) Those which exercise 
a hypotonic or relaxing effect on the vessels, and lower the blood- 
pressure; (2) those which have a hypertonic or constricting effect, 
and raise the blood-pressure. The poison or poisons circulating 
in the blood-plasma give rise to arterio-sclerosis, either directly by 
causing hyperplasia of the cellular elements, or indirectly by causing 
a supernormal blood-pressure or hypertonus. That morbid blood- 
plasma may cause arterio-sclerosis by hyperplasia is shown by the 
widespread thickening of arteries which occurs in some persons 
with hypotonus or persistent low blood-pressure. But the chief 
cause of arterio-sclerosis is a persistent high blood-pressure. There 
is but one cause of a persistent supernormal pressure— viz., arterial 
hypertonus — and but one cause of a persistent hypertonus — viz., 
some morbid element in the blood-plasma. It must therefore be 
admitted that the vaso-constrictor poisons arising from the ah- 
mentary canal play a prominent part in the causation of arterio- 
sclerosis. RusseU contends that such alimentary poisons are the 



ALIMENTARY TOX.TiMIA 331 

cause of most of the cases of arterio-sclerosis which are independent 
of renal disease. The most pernicious ahmentary toxins are those 
arising from protein decomposition, and those arising from animal 
proteins are said to be more poisonous than those from vegetable 
proteins. 

The Treatment of Alimentary Toxcemia. — The first thing is to see 
that the food itself is free from bacterial organisms of an injurious 
character. The second, that the food is of such a character that it 
will not favour bacterial fermentation Thirdly, moderation in 
diet, and especiallv animal food, is essential. There is no need to 
exclude animal food altogether. Although it is said that animal 
proteins are more prone to bacterial decomposition than vegetable 
proteins, it should be remembered that they are both composed of 
amino-acids, frequently the same kinds, although the proportions 
are different- — in fact, the animal proteins of our food were con- 
structed out of vegetable proteins consumed by the animals. 
Furthermore, it has never been shown that animal proteins behave 
in the body diflerentlv from vegetable proteins. Intestinal putre- 
faction is dircctlv proportional to the amount of proteins in the 
food. It is true there is a great difference in the amount of 
indol produced from foods. Zuntz found more indol is produced 
from meat than from vegetables. The food, therefore, should 
contain a small amount of meat, fish, or fowl; while a free use of 
the legumes (peas, beans, lentils and peanuts) should be en- 
couraged. Milk and cream can be used in moderation. A course 
of lacto-vegetarian dietary may be tried, and is often extremely 
useful, not onlv as a preventative of toxsemia, but to counteract 
constipation. 

There is a difference in the effect of carbohydrate foods. Bread, 
potatoes, and legumes give rise to most organic acids and flatulence, 
because a considerable proportion of them is carried down into the 
ileum, where the alkalinitv and slower peristalsis favour bacterial 
action. Rice, sago, tapioca, and arrowTOot, being absorbed almost 
entirelv in the jejunum or upper part of the ileum, may be con- 
sumed with stewed fruits, the acidity of which assists in checking 
bacterial growth. The rest of the food may consist of a little 
bread-and-butter, a small amount of roasted or grilled meat, cooked 
vegetables, milk, and a little red wine. The patient should avoid 
most kinds of fish, game, pork, veal, hashed meat, stews, rich gravy, 
soups, meat extract, pastrv, cheese, tea, and coffee. Sour milk has 
been used for some time as a remedy for intestinal fermentations, 
especially that soured bv the Bulgarian bacillus of Massol. Whey 
and buttermilk are likewise useful. 

Acidosis, or Acid Intoxicationr(see chapter on Diabetes). — A 
similar defect in metabolism of fat in children causes acidosis. The 
diet should consist chiefiv of proteins and some carbohydrates. Fat 
should be restricted. 



33= DTSFASFS OF THE TNTFSTINES 

Diarrhoea. 

A too frequent evacuation of the Iwwels arises from many causes. 
The commonest causes are impurities in the food, air, or water. 
It may arise from atmospheric chanp^es, nervous influences, enteric 
catarrh, dysentery, cholera, typhoid or tuberculous ulcerations, 
lardaceous disease, and various poisons in the blood. The term 
" diarrhoea " is more or less a relative one. Some persons are 
regularly moved two or three times a day, and do not feel well 
if they are not; but people who arc moved but once a day, or on 
alternate davs when in liealth, would consider two or three evacua- 
tions a day, even though the stools were only soft and mushy, to 
constitute diarrhoea. Much depends on habit. Diarrh(ea is most 
common in the summer or autumn, but it is promoted by alternate 
hot and rainy weather. It is most likely to affect people who are 
already in a state of ill-health, who are badly fed, who suffer from 
alcoholism or chronic diseases. Some people are never free from 
it; two or three evacuations occur every morning, with a little 
griping pain. This may be salutary, especially when it follows 
excessive eating, the consumption of unsuitable foods, or afflicts 
people who are subject to Bright's disease. But if it occurs through- • 
out the day, it should be regarded with suspicion, as tending towards 
enteric fever, dysentery, cholera, or some other disease. 

A few of the causes of diarrhoea may be detailed. When it 
results from the action of drugs, it passes off with the effect of the 
medicine. Many drugs quicken the peristaltic movement, and 
hurry the food and secretions along the ileum into the colon before 
there is time for absorption. Some, however, have little or no 
effect on the secretion or absorption, except by increasing the 
peristalsis. Others, like the salines, cause a profuse secretion of 
fluid, but have little or no effect upon peristalsis; whence the 
advisability of combining salines with aperients which stimulate 
peristalsis. Diarrhoea resulting from chills is probably due to an 
acute catarrh. Nervous diarrhoea is due to mental emotion, and, 
like " student's diarrhcea," is often very troublesome. " Morning 
diarrhoea " is often associated with alcoholism, dilatation of the 
stomach, chronic intestinal catarrh, or ulceration of the sigmoid 
flexure. It may be due to entozoa. It sometimes affects those 
suffering from Bright's disease. When it is due to the elimination 
of toxins through the intestinal mucous membrane, which are 
normally excreted by the kidneys, it probably has a salutary effect 
by averting a threatened uraemia. 

The consumption of ordinary food is not hkely to cause diarrhcea 
in a normal individual, but certain persons are liable to an attack 
of diarrhoea after the consumption'"of eggs or fatty food. The im- 
perfect digestion of certain foods will also cause it. The formation 
of toxins by the decomposition of proteins in the bowels by the 
normal flora will give rise to it. But the diarrhoea which may occur 
from foods such as cheese, ice-creams, stale meat, high-kept game, 



DIARRHiKA 



333 



iiKickfirl, aiul otlier lisli, is due to the toxins existing in them at 
the time of consumption. 

The fseces normally contain an immense number of bacteria, 
and the quantity evacuated daily amounts to many millions. If 
the faeces are retained too long in the intestines, the action of such 
bacteria may give rise to diarrluta. But the normal fteces have only 
a slight pathogenic power. The Bacillus coli communis is usually a 
harmless organism, but this harmlessness is said to be due to the 
protective action of the intestinal epithelium, which prevents the 
absorption of its toxins or the invasion of the tissues by the bacilh. 
Various lesions, however, may interfere with this protective influ- 
ence — e.g., hypenemia, desquamation of the epithelium, and the 
action of certain bodies such as butyric acid (always poisonous), 
and other toxins which produce actual changes in its walls. In 
such cases the B. coli obtains pathogenicity, and may lead to 
diarrhoea; indeed, Lesage considers that 25 per cent, of cases of 
diarrhcea occurring in breast-fed infants are due to this cause. 
There are, however, many varieties of B. coli, and Escherich is of 
opinion that B. coli communis is not concerned in the production 
of diarrhoea ; but it is held to be responsible for many outbreaks of 
diarrhoea by other authcjrities, who are fully aware of the error 
of mistaking this bacillus for allied varieties. The Bacillus B. 
of Duval, which approaches the colon bacillus in character, occurs 
in many faces during summer diarrhcea. Diarrluca is very often 
caused b}' bacteria introduced with the food or drink. Staphylo- 
coccus Pyogenes aureus from sore nipples may be taken into the 
organism of breast-fed babies. Streptococci are only slightly patho- 
genic, but they irritate the intestinal mucous membrane, and render 
it vulnerable to other bacteria. Streptococcus longtis in the milk of 
cows suffering from mastitis often causes diarrhoea. Many epi- 
demics of food-poisoning have been due to the Bacillus enteritidis 
of Gartner, which is found in the food and faeces; and a group of 
allied organisms, named by Durham B. certryke, frequently occur 
in diseased meat. The food may be contaminated with B. enteri- 
tidis sporogenes of Klein, B. botulinus, B. putrificus, or other 
organisms capable of causing diarrhoea, ptomaine-poisoning, etc. 
Specific diarrhct-as are due to B. tuberculosis, B. typhosus, B. cholerce, 
etc. B. dysenteries, many types of which have been isolated by 
Shiga, Flexner, and others, is now considered to be the ordinary 
cause of dysentery, although some cases are due to amoebae. 
" Asylum dysentery " is due to Shiga's bacillus. 

The Treatment of Diarrhcea. — A discovery of the cause is im- 
portant and almost essential to the correct treatment of the disease 
Absolute rest in bed or in the recumbent posture should be insisted 
on to avoid movements of the body. The application of warmth 
to the abdomen will assist in relieving cramp or griping pain. The 
administration of an aperient, such as castor-oil or rhubarb, is 
ncccssaiy to it move an}' remnants of decomj)osing food or un- 
digested material which irritates the mucous membrane. This may 



334 DISEASHS OF THE INTESTINES 

be sufticient trcatmciil in many cases of simple nun-lermcntative 
diarrhcva. The food, however, must be such as will not irritate 
the intestinal mucosa, and will leave as little residue as possible. 
If the disease is very acute or severe, all food must be withheld for 
a day or two, not only to avoid irritating the mucous membrane, 
but to minimize peristalsis as much as possible. Barley-water or 
alum whe\- may, however, be allowed in small quantities; but it 
should be sipped, and not taken in mouthfuls. When the symptoms 
are somewhat abated, begin feeding by giving milk and lime-water, 
albumin-water, lemon-water and white of egg, alum whey, ordinary 
whc}- or buttermilk, raw-meat juice, and a little red wine and 
water. The use of stimulants has to be considered. Red wine 
as a rule is permissible, and there is no doubt that the administra- 
tion of I ounce of good brandy at a single dose and almost neat is 
a useful remedy in many attacks of simple diarrhoea. It is not 
quite clear how the brandy acts, but it probably does so by para- 
l3zing the movements of the bowels and preventing peristaltic 
action; as a secondary effect it checks pain, and especially the 
irregular sensation of cramp or griping due to unequal peristaltic 
movements. Lime also checks the peristalticj movement of the 
bowels b}- inhibiting the involuntary muscular fibres; the action 
of chalk mixtures in curing diarrhoea is partly due to this effect 
of calcium salts. But lime has another effect. 1 he fatty acids which 
arise from protein decomposition or exist preformed in the con- 
sumed food act as powerful irritants to the mucous membrane, 
and stimulate peristalsis. This effect is prevented by neutralizing 
the acids, whether belonging to the fatty acid series or not, with 
chalk; insoluble soaps are thereby formed, and a thin pellicle is 
spread over the mucous surface, which protects it from irritation 
by other substances. 

When the symptoms have abated still more, we may proceed to 
give other food. If an inflammatory or acute catarrhal condition 
exists, it is proper to reduce the carbohydrates and give only pro- 
tein and fat in the food for a time. For this purpose a pure milk 
diet is useful. The amount of carbohydrate contained in it is 
not excessive, and it leaves a small residue. There is no reason for 
supposing that milk per se has any influence on the bacterial flora, 
but the lactose provides nutriment for the B. /adieus, and in- 
creases the acidity of the intestinal contents, and is thereby directly 
antagonistic to the putrefying organisms. The milk may be given 
as plain milk, milk and lime-water, junket, koumiss, kephir, and 
other sour-milk preparations. This treatment may be followed by 
raw-meat juice, the pulp of underdone meat, chicken souffle, etc. 

When there has been a decomposition of proteins, as in cases of 
diarrhoea from meat-poisoning, ptomaine-poisoning, and decompo- 
sition within the intestinal canal, a combination of milk and carbo- 
h}drates is the best. The milk may have rice boiled in it {rice-milk}, 
or it ma}- be thickened with arrowroot or cornflour, biscuit powder, 
Benger's, or other farinaceous foods. The white of an egg can be 



DIARRHOEA 335 

given in a teacupful of milk, and a little uutuiug, cinuanion, or 
ginger may be added. Carminatives relieve the pain of diarrlujea 
by lessening spasm or causing the peristaltic movements to be more 
even and regular; they also assist in expelling flatus, which is a 
frequent cause of pain and irregular peristaltic movement. Some- 
times milk disagrees with the patient. In such a case the food 
must consist of sago, tapioca, or rice, cooked in water until it is a 
jelly, flavoured with cinnamon or nutmeg, cream being added when 
it is served. As a general rule soup, broth, and all meat extracts 
are to be forbidden in cases of diarrhcea. But if people cannot 
take milk, we may allow the least irritating forms of meat essences, 
such as Brand's essence, Mosquera's meat jelly; and chicken or 
veal broth, thickened with flour, arrowroot, or ground rice. 

When the diarrhcea is passing off, the return to ordinary diet 
should be gradual. A little clear soup, mutton or chicken broth, 
with dry toast or stale bread in it, may form an early meal. Then 
custard, junket, jelly, or milk pudding may be taken. The next 
day a bit of sole, plaice, or whiting, and mashed potato, may form 
the meal; then boiled mutton or chicken. Care must be taken to 
avoid any substance likely to irritate the intestinal mucous mem- 
brane. If the attack has been at all severe, the patient must for 
some time avoid all uncooked fruit or vegetables, all stringy and 
fibrous fruits, brown or wholemeal bread, pickles, pork, pastry, 
the skin and gristly portions of meat, poultry, fish, etc. 

A few special varieties of diarrhoea require a little consideration. 
Morning diarrhoea should be treated by a light diet, free from all 
kinds (jf irritatuig substances. All liquids should be taken early 
in the day, and no fluids drank after 5 p.m. Evening diarrhoea is 
also often checked by taking no liquids in the early part of the day — 
say until the midday meal. In both these forms it is requisite to 
keep a watchful eye over the consumption of alcohol. 

Diarrhcea in tropical climates should be treated by a period of 
absolute rest in bed and an absolute milk diet It may be due to 
sprue, which is considered below. 

In the acute stage of dysentery the vomiting ma}^ be checked by 
a mustard plaster applied to the epigastrium; pain and tenderness 
of the abdomen by warm apphcations. The food should consist 
of albumin-water, rice-water, barley-water, chicken or mutton broth, 
until the tongue is clean; then add milk, custard, junket, jelly, blanc- 
mange, weak gruel (especially arrowroot), raw eggs, barley-water, 
and other demulcent drinks. Red wine may be beneficial, and 
brandy is sometimes prescribed up to 2 or 3 ounces daily. Vegetables 
and fruit must be avoided, also beef-tea, meat extracts, and pep- 
tones. " Asylum dysentery" requires a similar dietary. 

When cholera attacks a person, the treatment must be the same 
as for acute diarrhrea of bacterial origin. The vomiting may be 
checked by ice, ice-water, effervescing draughts, champagne, or 
brandy-and-soda. Advantage must be taken of pauses in the 
vomiting to give the patient some food. At Ikst the diet must 



336 DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES 

consist of whey, buttermilk, koumiss, or kephir. If milk must be 
given, owing to the former articles not being at hand, it should be 
combined with sodium citrate, to prevent the formation of curds. 
White of egg and lemon-water may be of advantage in checking 
the vomiting, and at the same time a means of introducing a little 
food. VeaJ broth or chicken broth may be given. The use of beef- 
tea and meat extracts is forbidden, but there are some cases where 
the stimulating properties of xanthin and creatin are advantageous, 
especially when the patient is collapsed. The use of Valentine's 
meat juice, raw-meat juice, Brand's essence, or Bovinine, in small 
doses then may be beneficial. Collapse must be met by brandy or 
champagne, various di-ugs, and saline injections into the sub- 
cutaneous tissues: and the use of hot-water bottles to the feet and 
sides, a hot-water bag or other warm application to the abdomen, 
a mustard-plaster over the heart, and wrapping the patient in 
blankets. As soon as the vomiting is checked, raw eggs and milk, 
custard, junket, or jelly, ma\- be given. 

When the diarrhoea is associated with peritonitis, and frequent 
vomiting prevents very much food being given by the mouth, 
abstinence from food for twenty-four hours may be a better method 
of treatment than attempts at feeding. But if it seems desirable 
to give anything during the vomiting, it should be only a little 
Valentine's meat juice, Brand's essence of beef, or other meat jelly, 
and albumin-water or white of Q^g and lemon-water. When the 
vomiting ceases, milk and sodium citrate, junket, custard, or jelly, 
ma}' be given in teaspoonful doses every few minutes, and the diet 
gradually built up on the lines already indicated. 

Diarrl'icea ma}' be due to tuberculous ulceration of the bowels ; 
this should be suspected when a long-continued diarrhrea exists 
in connection with abdominal pain or tenderness and tumidity of 
the abdomen, especially if the diarrhoea is accompanied by slight 
haemorrhages from the bowels. The disco\-ery of Bacillus tuberculosis 
in the faeces or sputum would be confirmatory evidence of its exis- 
tence. 1 he diarrhoea alone is not sufticient to establish a diagnosis. 
The food should be bland and unirritating. Eggs, milk, pounded 
chicken or hsh, chicken broth or veal broth, farinaceous foods, such 
as Mellin's, Benger's, Savory and Moore's. If the milk is not 
absorbed, as shown by the presence of curds in the stools, add 
sodium citrate to it, or peptonize it; if it does not appear to be 
absorbc d when treated thus, it must be omitted. 

Chronic Diarrhoea may be due to a continuance of any of the 
fore-mentioned causes. A prolonged fermentation in the small 
intestines gives rise to that condition called by Nothnagel " acid 
jejunal diarrhoea," and another variety called by Schmidt and 
Strassburger " intestinal fermentation dyspepsia." The diarrhoea 
may be of a continuous character — that is, frequent loose motions 
occurring from da}- to day, the stools being excessively acid, and 
frequently frothy. It may be of an alternative character, the 
diarrhoea consisting of the discharge of thin or soft faeces, combined 



ClfROMC DIARRIiaiA 337 

with mucus, and accompanied I)y pain, alternating vvitli consti- 
pation. It may l)c of a lienteric character, the food Ix'ing hurried 
rapidly along the alimentary canal, so that undigested foodstuffs 
appear in the faeces soon after meals, or the faeces are evacuated 
in an unformed or pultaceous mass. It may be of a colliquative 
character, the diarrh(ea consisting of profuse liquid stools, and more 
or less exhausting in its effects. 

Treatment. — In chronic diarrhcea it is probably more important 
to insist upon what the patient should not take than on what 
should be eaten. However carefully planned the diet may be, 
the neglect to instil into the patient's mind a knowledge of what 
should be avoided would certainly be an error. It is not sutftcient 
to tell him to avoid indigestible articles of food, pastry, vegetables, 
and raw fruit. He must be careful to remove " all skins and bones, 
strings and stones " (Brunton). If these cannot be removed from 
the food, it must be rejected. They include the skin and gristly 
portions of all kinds of meat, fowl, game, and fish; the stringy fibces 
in meat, sinews in all kinds of birds; the scales of sardines, pilchards, 
herrings, trout; the bones of sardines, and spicula of bone from 
other flesh foods; sardines and whitebait should be rejected. The 
skins of vegetables — e.g., potatoes and tomatoes— should be removed ; 
also the skins of apples, pears, peaches, apricots, plums, goose- 
berries, and grapes. Currants, raisins, and marmalade should be 
avoided. The strings in various fruits should be removed — bananas, 
oranges, peaches, apples, and pears. The strings in vegetables 
should be removed; peas, beans, carrots, turnips, cabbage, cauli- 
flower, asparagus, etc., should be rejected. The seeds should be 
removed from all fruits — grapes, currants, gooseberries, straw- 
berries, and raspberries. All kinds of nuts should be rejected. 
In general, the patient should avoid all fatty and greasy foods, rich 
food, pork, veal, duck, goose, salmon, mackerel, coarse or tough 
meat, hashed meat; salted, smoked, pickled, or dried meat and 
fish; strong soup of all kinds, beef-tea, meat extracts; pies, pastry, 
cakes, sweet foods, confectionery; sweet wines, syrups, and malt 
liquors; fibrous vegetables, cabbage, savoy, salads, and raw vege- 
tables; brown or wholemeal bread, rye bread, oatmeal, ponidge, 
maize-meal, hominy; sweet potatoes, yams, artichokes, pickles; 
all laxative fruits such as rhubarb and prunes; figs, dates, nuts, and 
most kinds of raw fruit. 

The best diet is undoubtedly one consisting wholly of milk, 
eggs, scraped meat, and foods which have been reduced to a pulp 
and passed through a sieve. This is not always obtainable, but it 
should be carried out as nearly as possible. Scraped meat, to the 
extent of i pound a day, is very beneficial. Milk should be boiled, 
but may be drunk warm or cold according to taste, and alone or 
with lime-water, barley-water, Perrier, Salutaris, or other aerated 
waters. It can also be given in the form of junket, custard, or 
jelly made with isinglass or ordinary table jellies; blanc-mange, 
arrowroot, cornflour; or as milk-soup flavoured with celery, essence 



33« DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES 

of celery, or celery salt; it can be peptonized, or fortified witli dried 
milk powder or casein-preparations; or taken in the form of koumiss, 
kephir, or yaourte. Well-cooked milk puddings are allowable in 
many cases, unless there is reason to avoid carbohydrates (fermenta- 
tive diarrh(va) ; rice, sago, tapioca, macaroni, and vermiceUi (but 
not semolina, pearl barley, or groats). Eggs may be taken raw, 
poached, or boiled; buttered or scrambled eggs are allowable some- 
times, but not in all cases, owing to the quantity of butter used in 
their preparation. Weak soups are allowed to most patients — 
e.g., mutton broth, chicken broth, veal broth; they can be flavoured 
with mint, thyme, parsley, garlic, onion, celery, or tomatoes, but 
they must be strained to remove vegetables; they may, however, 
be thickened with flour, fine oatmeal, arrowroot, or revalenta, or 
eaten with dry toast, torrefied bread, zwiebach, or plain biscuit. 
The light kinds of fish are also permissible to most patients (sole, 
plaice, whiting, and fresh haddock) ; also sweetbread and tripe. 
Chicken panada or souffle is serviceable. Beef or mutton should 
be scraped and eaten raw; it can be taken in aspic jelly or port 
wine. Raw-beef juice is very good, and although strong soups and 
beef-tea are injurious. Brand's essence, Valentine's meat juice, 
Mosquera's beef jelly, and similar preparations are serviceable. 
Some patients may be allowed a small slice of tender, underdone 
beef or mutton, providing they remove the skin and fibrous portions. 
" Fletcherism " is useful. Bread must be stale and good, the crust 
should be avoided. The crumb of good stale bread crumbles 
into bits when rubbed between the finger and thumb. If it makes 
" pills," it should be rejected. Dry toast, torrefied bread, and 
zwiebach may be eaten. Biscuits or crackers which break into a 
powder are permissible, providing they are well masticated. Sponge 
cakes, Madeira cakes (without peel or currants), finger biscuits, 
Marie biscuits, etc., are allowable. Butter may be taken in 
moderation. Amongst vegetables we may allow potatoes (boiled or 
steamed), spinach, vegetable marrow, and a few tender kidney 
beans. Peas, cabbage, cauliflower, and tomatoes may also be eaten 
if they are passed through a sieve. In most cases the patient 
may have cooked apples, plums, damsons, peaches, cherries; raw 
oranges, plums, cherries, and bananas. Grapes must be freed 
from the skins and stones. Strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, 
and currants can only be allowed when they have been passed 
through a sieve; they can then be eaten alone or with sugar and 
cream. Apple jelly, black-currant jeUy, quince jelly, or guava 
jelly ma\- be eaten \\ith bread-and-butter. Honey and golden syrup 
are not injurious, but they sometimes have a laxative effect. The 
same remark apphes to prunes and rhubarb. 

The amount of fluids consumed should not be excessive. Per- 
haps it may advantageously be reduced to 2 pints, or, when the 
diet consists largely of milk, to 3 pints. Cocoa may be taken 
freely. Acorn coffee and leguminose cocoa are recommended by 
many people. Coffee is occasionally laxative. China tea may be 



used. A little (lilutcd spirit, such as brandy or sloe gin, may bt; 
taken. Red wine is good, and sloe wine or whortleberry wine is 
specially recommended. There is little doubt that most cases of 
long-continued diarrheea are benefited by a diet consisting largely 
of proteins, and if it is decided to give this treatment a trial, some 
such diet as the following may be recommended: 

Breakfast. — Cocoa, acorn coffee, or leguminose cocoa, two eggs, and a piece 
1)1 dry toast. 

1 1 a.m. — Kcphir, kfmmiss, or yaourte, with a cracker or biscuit. 

Midday. — Sole, plaice, or other light fish; scraped meat, scraped tongue, 
sweetbread, or chicken soutHe, vegetable puree, or vegetable marrow; custard, 
jelly, or strawberries, raspberries, or currants passed through a sieve; 3 or 4 
ounces of red wine. 

4 p.m. — China tea, dry toast and butter, one egg. 

7 p.m. — The same as at midday. 

Bedtime. — Koumiss or kephir, zweibach or cracker. 

Chronic Tropical Diarrhoea, Hill Diarrhoea. — Tropical diarrhoea is 
attended by symptoms ol disordered digestion, malnutrition, and 
progressive emaciation. Thin says the whole alimentary canal, 
and particularly the small intestine, becomes atrophied; but not- 
withstanding the general atrophy, there is a true sclerosis of the 
submucosa due to a development of the connective tissue, which 
leads to a degeneration of the glands and follicles. He believes 
the cause to be a specific poison which finds its best soil for develop- 
ment in the ileum. It alters the secretion of the mucosa and allows 
the food to retain its acidity, whence the dyspepsia, malnutrition, 
and acid stools. It destroys' the colouring matter of the bile, and 
causes anaemia. The disease begins with psilosis lingucB, which 
causes discomfort in the mouth and throat and difficulty in swallow- 
ing. In its fully developed condition it gives rise to sprue or the 
white flux. The activity of the poison is increased by the nature 
of the intestinal contents. It develops freely in farinaceous and 
animal foods, but docs not appear to grow in milk. Milk, however, 
is not the only substance in which it will not thrive, for it does not 
live on the juice of strawberries. Thin therefore recommends a 
milk diet, but he permits the consumption of strawberries to the 
extent of 2 or 3 pounds a day. Strawberries should not be taken 
in place of food, but between meals, and they may be taken with a 
little cream. They are usually borne well, and are distinctly 
curative. Thin considers their effect arises from the inability of 
the poison to five in them, and is not due to the mechanical effect 
of the seeds, and a diet of strawberries and milk will starve it out. 
It is possible that other fruits may have a similar effect, especially 
medlars. The milk should be taken through a quill or glass tube, 
or sipped with a spoon, in sufficient quantity to support the body, 
and, if possible, improve the nutrition (3 to 4 pints a day), and it 
should be warm ancl made alkaline by the addition of 6 to 10 grains 
of sodium or jiotassium bicarbonate, or lime-water for children. 
" All milk and only milk " appears to be the safest cure for natives 



340 DISFASFS OF TIIF IXTFSTINFS 

who do not take meat; but meat diet gives very satisfaetory results 
in many eases. The mouth and teeth should be cleaned with an 
antiseptic wash after each meal. 

Cantlie considers the acrid vegetable oils used in tropical 
countries by the Chinese cooks is a serious source of irritation to 
the mucous membrane, and aggravates sprue. He discarded milk 
because relapses were frequent, and prescribed meat diet, which he 
considers more satisfactory. He prescribes hrst of all a diet con- 
sisting of raw -meat juice, freshly made beef essence, raw' -meat 
sandwiches, scraped beef, and plain jelly, the patient being fed 
every hfteen to thirty minutes. As strength increases the food is 
given at longer intervals and larger quantities. At the end of a 
week's treatment the patient is given 4 or 5 ounces of beef, minced 
in a machine, three times a day. About this time also the minced 
beef should be rapidly heated over a bright tire. Between the 
meals, and during the night, the patient is allowed plain jelly or 
calves'-foot jelly ad libitum. As a beverage hot water is allowed, 
also toast -water, China tea, and rice tea, the latter being made by 
pouring boiling water over roasted rice. The white of an egg can 
be mixed with the minced meat. About the tenth to fourteenth 
day the patient is allowed a slice of beef or mutton from any joint, 
underdone roast beef being the best. Boiled chicken or pigeon, 
and easily digested fish, are also allowed. Rice, boiled and steamed 
until dry, is allowed quite earl}' in the treatment ; but it is a long time 
before milk puddings are added to the list. Pulled bread, and bread 
cut into thin slices and baked in an oven until it is dry and crisp, 
are allowed after tw'O or three weeks. The first vegetables allowed 
should be spinach, seakale, vegetable marrow, and boiled celery. 
Strawberries are alloW'Cd to be eaten abundantly between the meals. 
In this way the patient gradually returns to an ordinary mixed diet, 
and its effect is seen by an alteration of the colour and appearance 
of the faeces. With a milk diet the stool becomes solid, but it has 
scarcely the odour or appearance of faeces. The meat diet, on the 
other hand, brings down a dark-coloured bihous motion; the 
digestive organs in general become more active and their functions 
re-established; the liver especially is called upon, and it increases 
rapidly in size, and normal activity results. In combination with 
this treatment, physiological rest is necessary. The patient should 
remain in bed until vegetables can be added to the diet. Manson 
considers a milk diet is the best to begin treatment with, but it 
should not be slavishly adhered to; and the use of strawberries, 
apples, and bananas, is of considerable value. Thin also agrees 
that there is a stage in the treatment when milk diet is no longer 
required, when meat is borne well and causes immediate improve- 
ment. But this stage is when the specific diseased condition no 
longer exists, and its sequelae only remain. In the early stages, he 
insists, milk is the best food ; but w^hen the right time arrives, which 
is found by experiment, meat should be added to the food, and the 
diet gradually built up, as in the treatment of ulcer of the stomach. 



niARRHCEA IN INFANTS 34c 

The use of various I'raits has bsen recommended in the treatment 
of chronic diarrhoea Mercier^ strongly recommends medlars in 
the cure of all cases of chronic enteritis, providing there is no acute 
dysentery. It is to be observed, however, that he gives them with 
ji pints of milk in twenty-four hours. He prescribes \ pound of 
medlars a day; the fruit should not be soft (over-ripe)," should be 
peeled, and the stones taken out. If an attack of dysentery inter- 
\-ene, the medlars should be stopped, and resumed again when it 
l)asses off. The results are said to be speedy and constant. The 
fruit never causes constipation. As the stools become normal, he 
adds in succession to the diet raw eggs, cream of rice, sweetbread, 
hght fish, brains, chicken, beef-steak, and bread, milk remaining 
as a beverage The medlar season lasts only from November to 
January. The fruit can be preserved, but it is not so beneficial 
as fresh fruit Mercier recommends the following mode of preserva- 
tion: Medlars i kilo, sugar 800 grammes, water |- litre; put them into 
l)ottles, boil them, and seal them hermetically 

Among alcoholic beverages red wines, Hungarian, old port, sloe 
wine, sloe gin, whortlebern,^ wine, barberry wine are recommended; 
and toddy made from the fermented juice of the cocoanut palm is 
said to be a specific for chronic diarrhoea and dysentery. 

Diarrhoea in Infants and Children. 

The causes of diarrhcea in children are autogenetic or hetero- 
genctic: (i) Aufogen.'tic : Gastro-enteric catarrh (acute and chronic), 
intestinal fermentation, toxaemia. (2) Heterogenetic : Mechanical 
irritation, nervous influences, drugs, etc., acting through the milk; 
improper feeding; bacterial infection. 

While agreeing with the infective nature of many forms of 
diarrhcEa, too much stress cannot be laid on the part played by 
improper feeding. Breast-fed infants seldom suffer from diarrhoea. 
It occurs chiefl}' in bottle-fed children or in those recently weaned. 
It may arise from an excess of casein in the food or an inability to 
digest it. The curd acts as a foreign body, setting up diarrhoea 
by mechanical irritation; or it undergoes putrefactive decomposi- 
tion, and gives rise to a toxaemia, of which the diarrhoea is a symp- 
tom. It may arise from an excess of carbohydrates, especially 
maltose and the malted foods of commerce. It may arise from an 
excess of fat, especially the fat of cow's milk. The scientific basis 
of the requirement for plenty of fat in the child's food is beyond 
dispute. But it must be digestible fat, that of human milk when 
possible. The food of infants from birth to six months should 
contain 4-0 per cent, of fat, from six to nine months 4-5 per cent., 
from nine to twelve months 4-0 per cent., and from twelve months 
onwards 3-5 per cent. It is evident that diluted cow's milk does 
not contain the proportion required. We therefore recommend the 
use of " top-milk," cream, and other humanized milk mixtures. 

1 Practitioner, rgoj, ii. 570. 



343 DISEASES OP THE INTESTINES 

The additional fat increases the weight of the child, improves the 

nervous system, and the blood-making cells in the marrow of the 

bones. It has the further effect of preventing the aggregation of 

casein into large masses of curd, and rendering the milk more easily 

digested. But occasionally infants cannot digest foods containing 

more than i per cent, of fat from cow's milk. This is especially the 

case when the additional fat consists of " separator cream." It gives 

rise to indigestion, fat-diarrhoea, acidosis and convulsions. The 

inability to digest fat results in enfeebled vitahty; the enfeebled 

vitality causes a lessening of the oxidative processes in the tissues. 

The disturbance of the digestive processes leads to the formation of 

oxybut}Tic acid, which causes an acid auto-intoxication {acidosis), 

and secondarily, an increased destruction of protein to supply 

energy', while the imperfect nitrogenous metabolism leads to the 

production and excretion of ammonia in the urine. Fat is necessary 

to the organism, but it must be digestible fat. The normal faeces 

of the breast-fed child contain some fat. But the fat of cow's 

milk, consisting of much larger globules, is less easily digested than 

that of human milk. The difference in the size of the fat globules 

of human milk and milk fresh from the cow is very great. But 

the difference between the fat globules in human milk and in 

" separator cream " is far greater. The act of centrifugalizing the 

milk, in order to separate the cream sold in shops, breaks up many 

of the milk globules; they become aggregated together, and form 

tiny particles of butter. The emulsion is more or less destroyed. 

Many children cannot digest such cream, and it must be substituted 

by " gravity cream " or that collected by skimming the milk set 

aside for six or eight hours. 

Mechanical irritation is the cause of diarrhoea resulting from 
attempts to feed young children with bread, oatmeal, barley flour, 
and proprietary foods containing much starch. In older children 
diarrhoea often follows the consumption of partly cooked cereals, 
fruit containing seeds (strawberries, currants, gooseberries), dried 
fruits (figs, cake containing carraway seeds, raisins, or currants), 
green vegetables (boiled cabbage, cauliflower, carrot, turnip, celery, 
lettuce, watercress), all of which act virtually as foreign bodies, 
irritate the mucous membrane, cause an increased peristalsis, and 
sometimes a catarrhal inflammation of the mucosa. 

The effect of drugs need scarcely be mentioned, except to remind 
the reader that many drugs are excreted by the mammary gland, 
and therefore aperients may affect the nursing infant through the 
milk. In the same way the consumption of cabbage, cauHflower, 
pickles, prunes, and other substances by the mother will affect the 
nursing child, and may cause diarrhoea. 

Catarrhal diarrhcea is the ordinary looseness of the bowels which 
affects children in early life, especially during dentition. Nervous 
influences may excite diarrhoea. This sometimes happens when the 
surface of the body gets chilled, or as a result of the depression 
caused by excessive heat, fatigue, exhaustion, fear, excitement. 



DIAliRHGiA IN INFANTS 343 

Coldness of the feet is a common cause of stomach ache and loose- 
ness of the bowels in infants. Many instances of diarrhoea are 
characterized by an exaggerated peristalsis. In such a case the 
consumption of food, taking a chill, a fright, or excitement, will 
immediately start a violent peristalsis, in consequence of which the 
food is hurried rapidly along the alimentary canal, and undigested 
materials appear in the faeces. The mother often says of such 
cases: " My child's food passes through it as soon as it is eaten." 
This form is called lienteric diarrhoea. Even older children may be 
troubled with this exaggerated peristalsis, which, when started by 
eating, frequently causes the cliild to hurry away from the table, 
owing to the sharp pain and rapid action of the bowels. 

Diarrhoea due to bacterial influences is most prevalent in the 
summer-time, whence it is called " summer diarrhoea." }3ut the pre- 
disposing causes of such diarrhrea are exceedingly important: they 
are the age and constitution of the child, improper feeding, and bad 
environment. Given one or more of these predisposing causes, 
a shght exciting cause will start the diarrhoea. One of the most 
striking features is the prevalence of the disease in hot weather. 
An epidemic does not begin until the mean temperature of the 
atmosphere is 60° to 61° F., and remains so for four to eight days. 
The epidemic begins towards the end of July, is in full force through- 
out August, and lasts well into the third week of September, the 
mortahty being highest during the first weeks of the epidemic, 
because few dehcate infants can stand the first month of great heat. 
But heat alone is not sufficient to give rise to an epidemic. The 
disease is of infectious origin. The temperature, which is necessary 
for the production of diarrhoea, is the same as that most suitable 
for the activity of the bacteria. The disease is most common among 
recently weaned children and those fed wholly or partly on cow's 
milk. Cow's milk ordinarily contains an enormous number of 
bacteria, increasing in proportion to the time which has elapsed 
since milking, and the temperature at which it is kept. But the 
infection causing summer dianhoea may be of two kinds: 

I. Autogenctic, resulting from the normal bacterial flora of the 
intestines becoming pathogenic. The change in the action of the 
bacteria and the nature of the products is dependent upon some 
alteration in the conditions in the alimentary canal. The result 
of the change, however, is the production of a severe gastro-enteric 
intoxication, which is not always distinguishable by the clinical 
signs from acute indigestion. As a rule, however, the temperature 
is higher, the nervous prostration greater, the stools more hquid 
and offensive. 

2. The heterogenetic form of summer diarrhoea is far more fatal. 
It is due to the introduction of bacteria from without, usually in 
the food. The bacteria are Streptococci, Staphylococci, Enfcritidis 
sporogenes, colon bacillus, the proteus, the bacillus of Shiga, and 
Bacillus cyanogenus. There are several clinical types of the disease, 
but they probably depend less on the kind of bacteria than on other 



344 DISEASES OE THE ISTESTINES 

conditions, sucli as the state of the mucous membrane or the re- 
sisting power of tlie child's organism. The term diolcra infantum 
is only a generic name, and not a very satisfactory one. The 
important symptoms are due to the absorption of toxins, produced 
b}- the bacteria, which create a profound impression on the 
heart, nerve centres, and especially the vasomotor centres. The 
vomiting and purging may be due to toxins or an effort of nature 
to rid the organism of their presence. The high temperature is 
due to a disturbance of the heat centre, and is a characteristic of 
many toxic conditions. The loss of elasticity of the skin is likewise 
a s}inptom of the profound toxaemia, and is a grave sign. 

The Treatment is both prophylactic and remedial. Prophylactic 
measures consist of breast-feeding and avoiding weaning in the 
summer-time. Bottle-fed children should have pure milk made into 
mixtures of a proper composition and suited to their age. The milk 
should be filtered through a layer of cotton-wool to remove bacteria: 
80 per cent, of the bacteria in milk can be removed by this means. 
Improper foods must be ax'oided, especially an excess of casein and 
malted foods. Overfeeding must be avoided as carefully as improper 
feeding. Children become thirsty in hot weather, bui: they should 
not be given more food on that account. They should be given 
plain boiled water or distilled water to quench their thirst. There 
are two reasons why water should be boiled or distilled for young 
children: The first is for the destruction of bacteria, and boihng 
or distilling the w'ater on this account is always necessary. The 
second reason is equally important. Hard water contains salts 
of lime and magnesia, which combine with fatty acids in the 
alimentary canal, and form insoluble soaps, thereby causing a loss 
of valuable fat from the food. Infants' food seldom contains too 
much fat for healthy children, often not enough. If, therefore, 
any of the fat can be saved by eliminating unnecessary salts of lime 
and magnesia, a useful purpose will be served by giving only boiled 
or distilled water. Other prophylactic measures consist of scrupu- 
lous cleanhness of the napkins and clotliing, freedom from dust in 
the house (which consists chiefly of organic matters), protection 
from flies, and sudden changes of temperature. A thin flannel or 
woollen (not flannelette) garment should be worn next the skin 
to protect the abdomen from chills. The feet should be covered. 
Fresh air and sunhght are essential. 

The remedial measures consist of relief from the sickness and 
purging, removal of nervous depression and toxic symptoms, and 
reduction of the temperature. The vomiting may be reheved by 
lime-water, barley-water, milk of magnesia, washing out and resting 
the stomach. Drugs may assist by soothing the irritable condition 
of the mucous membrane. Ingluvin, calomel, or the hypodermic 
injection of small doses of morphine and atropine are useful. 
Astringents are of little value for checking the purging in severe 
cases, especially while the toxaemia and high temperature last. 
Should the purging continue after the temperature has fallen to 



DIARRHiEA /.V INFANTS 345 

nearly normal, astringents will then be more useful. During the 
acute phase of the disease an attempt must be made to stop the 
septic prcjcess by other means. The best way of eliminating the 
bacteria probably consists of abstinence from food, which supplies 
the nutritive media on which they flourish. The purging is an 
effort of nature to rid the system of the toxic substances. Hence 
the administration of purgatives and lavage of the colon will assist 
nature in her design. At the same time various drugs of an anti- 
septic character may be given by the mouth. Colon lavage is one 
of the best means of bringing down the temperature. 

The dietary is of extreme importance. Breast-fed infants shoal d 
be kept from the breast so long as vomiting occurs. Thsy may 
be fed with a little albumin- water, barley-water, or whey; and 
stimulants if they seem desirable. After twenty-four hours' rest 
of the stomach it is usually safe to resume breast-feeding gradually, 
at first allowing the child to suck for only two or three minutes at 
a time, by which means he will get one-fifth to one-fourth the usual 
amount of milk. He should be fed with albumin-water, whey, or 
albumin-water with a little meat juice, every two hours, until a 
considerable progress is made towards recovery. In these and other 
children the depression must be fought by the administration of 
brandy, champagne, camphor-water, musk, or ether. If stimulants 
are rejected when given by the mouth, small doses of strychnine 
and ether may be given hypodermically, or saline solution may be 
slowly injected into the subcutaneous tissues of the abdomen or 
buttocks. 

In the case of hand-fed children all ordinary foods must be 
stopped until the vomiting ceases, merely giving a little plain water 
or barley-water. When these are retained, begin to feed cautiously 
with egg-albumin and lemon-water, whey, white wine whey, butter- 
milk, chicken broth, or veal broth, a teaspoonful every quarter 
of an hour. We are cautioned by various authorities against the 
use of meat extracts, because they tend to increase diarrhcea. 
But there are cases where the stimulating effect of xanthin and 
creatin is valuable; and when a child docs not react with egg- 
albumin or whey, no harm can be done, and possibly good may 
result from administering Valentine's meat juice, Bovinine, Brand's 
essence of beef, or Hipi in small doses. Albumin-water is insipid, 
but a few drops of Bovinine, Valentine's meat juice, or Hipi, will 
improve the flavour, and give to it stimulating properties which 
are lacking. Children of four or five months' old may have a little 
panopepton or beef jelly (Mosquera's). Children from this age 
onwards may also have starch emulsion (arrowroot being prefer- 
able) with egg-albumin. Starch emulsion is useful by checking 
protein decomposition and a persistent diarrhrea. 

A year old child may also have, during the acute stage, whey 
and cream, veal broth and rusk, Mellin's food and barley-water, 
ever\- alternate meal. Older children may have arrowroot and 
wliite of egg, whey and white of egg. white of egg and lemon-water, 



346 DISEASES OF THE ISTESTINES 

chicken broth, veal broth or mutton broth, a httle black-currant 
or whortleberry jell^^ rusks, dry toast, fermented milk or koumiss, 
the return to ordinary diet being gradual. 

As soon as the acute stage passes off, which is known by the 
cessation of vomiting, moderation of the diarrhoea, and reduction 
of the temperature, infants may have mixtures consisting of whey 
and cream, buttermilk and cream, or Qgg mixtures. Children more 
than four years old may have Melhn's food and barley-water or 
other dcxtrinized foods: whey and cream, buttermilk and cream, 
ogg mixtures, peptonized milk, condensed milk and water i in 8 
(temporarily), fermented cow's milk, yaourte, or koumiss. In all 
these substances the protein differs in its physical condition from 
the casein in ordinary cow's milk. Whey can easily be prepared 
by the addition of hquid rennet, junket tablet, or powder, to warm 
milk. A pint of milk yields 12 to 14 ounces of whey. Buttermilk 
can be obtained from a dairy. Yaourte or leben is prepared by 
the lactic ferment, which is sold in various forms by all chemists. 
Ordinary fermented milk, usually the nearest approach to koumiss, 
is prepared with ordinary yeast and entire or skim milk, according 
as much or httle fat in the food is desired. The table on the 
opposite page shows the composition of these substances and of 
mixtures prepared from them. 

When the diarrhoea passes off, we must consider, if the food has 
been at fault, how best to correct the error. If the fat has been in 
excess of the child's ability to digest or metabolize it, owing to 
defective assimilation or oxidation in the tissues, the proportion, 
must be reduced. Cream mixtures should be avoided in such cases 
The child should be fed, temporarily at least, on whey and white 
of egg (egg mixtures. No. i or 3), condensed milk and whey, Mellin's 
food and whey or milk, extract of malt and milk, gradually in- 
creasing the strength of the food and adding gravity cream, but not 
separator cream, as the functions of digestion and metabolism 
improve. If malted foods have caused diarrhoea, avoid them and 
malt extracts also. // the casein has been in excess of the child's 
digestive capacity, give agg mixtures, cream mixtures, or whey and 
cream mixtures, wherein the casein is changed and rendered more 
easily digested. In cream, whey, and buttermilk the casein co- 
agulates in fine flocculi. Even in condensed milk and water the 
casein coagulates in smaller curds than in ordinary milk. If, 
however, the poverty of the family is such that the child must be 
fed upon diluted milk, let it be treated so that the casein cannot 
form large or hard curds. The addition of i grain of sodium citrate 
to each ounce of milk will prevent the formation of curds by the 
precipitation of lime, a chemical action resulting in the formation 
of calcium citrate and phosphate of soda taking place. The addi- 
tion of a teaspoonful of extract of malt to \ pint of warm milk 
will, in ten minutes, alter the casein so that it will be precipitated 
in fine tufts or flocculi httle larger than those of human milk. 
When obtainable, gravity cream can be added to this mixture to raise

Constipation. 

Constipation is a consequence of civihzation, and is largely 
dependent upon the composition and preparation of the food. 
Primitive man ate roots, leaves, seeds, and fruit, and animal food, 
with very little preparation. In unciviHzed communities to-day 
the food is eaten after very little preparation and very little cooking, 
so that the indigestible residue is a mechanical stimulus to peristaltic 
action. Constipation is a necessary sequence of the art of pre- 
paring and cooking the food. The coarse meal resulting from 



i 



348 DISHASFS 01- THE TSTfSTINES 

primitive modes of g^rinding grain and roots is very different from 
the entire wheatmeal of the modern miller; and entire wheatmeal 
contains nuieh more celhilose than the line white flour of the steel 
roller mill. The latter is almost devoid of cellulose, and the hne 
starch is almost entirely transformed into sugar by the alimentary 
enzNines. and leaves little residue behind it. Similarly, the vege- 
tables, fruits, and seeds consumed in the present age by civilized 
people ha\e been developed by art to such an extent that they 
contain much less woody hbre than similar articles grown in the 
early days of cultivation; in fact, the influence of man upon all 
kinds of foodstuffs tends to their reftnement. The bulk of the 
food is reduced by the removal of coarse material, and it contains 
comparatively little residue. Some persons who have a deficient 
appetite eat very little vegetable food, and consequently the 
stimulus to peristalsis is absent. Moreover, the food consumed may 
be too soft, as a diet consisting of bread-and-butter, tea, and farin- 
aceous foods. Hence the poor, who live largely on bread, butter, 
potatoes, etc., may suffer from constipation as much as the rich 
whose diet consists largely of tender meat, game, and otlicr foods 
of a high quality and concentration. In addition to the mechanical 
stimulus of the food, there should be a chemical stimulus arising 
from its composition. Certain sugars, neutral salts, gases, by their 
presence stimulate secretion or peristalsis or both, and their absence 
tends to constipation. 

Another cause of constipation arises from the dryness of the 
faeces. This may be due to various causes— ^.g., drinking too little 
fluids. It has been shown that about 4 pints of water are eliminated 
from the bod}' daily, and in ordinary circumstances part of this 
goes out by the bowels. But many people drink as little as \ or 
I pint of fluids daily, which is not sufficient to keep the faces soft. 
As the contents of the alimentary canal pass along its course, more 
and more liquid is absorbed, and the longer the residuum remains 
in contact with its walls, the drier it becomes. If a healthy indi- 
vidual, who is accustomed to a daily evacuation, is involuntarily 
compelled to omit the evacuation for twenty-four hours, the faeces 
remaining in the colon become drier and firmer, and form scybala, 
or become pressed into a hard mass of less bulk than the usual 
faeces from a single day's food. Extraordinary exercise on the part 
of the subject may lead to constipation by causing undue evapora- 
tion of moisture from the skin, thereby concentrating the liquids 
of the body. Excessive diuresis has the same effect — e.g., in 
diabetes. The dryness of the fseces may arise from some constituent 
of the food. Milk is apt to produce such faeces when it is taken 
alone and in large quantities, because large masses of curd become 
matted together and resist the action of enzymes. When milk is 
combined with farinaceous foods, it does not form such large curds, 
because of the interposition of starch granules, and such curds 
readily fall to pieces and become digested. The consumption of 
\ery hard water causes dry fgeces, because the lime inhibits the 



CONSTIPATION 349 

action of involuntary muscular fibres, and thereby causes the 
food to remain longer in contact with the mucous membrane, and 
moisture to be absorbed. 

There arc many other causes of constipation Atony of the 
bowels or diminution of the peristaltic and expulsive power is a 
common cause of the ailment. There may be a disproportion in 
the de\-elopment of the muscular system. As Brunton points out, 
the voluntary muscles may be well developed, but the involuntary 
muscles less developed than in a normal individual. The intestines 
may become weakened by disease — e.g., fever, chronic intestinal 
catarrh, peritonitis, and affections of the nervous mechanism. 
Constipation niay arise from weakness of the abdominal muscles, 
as a consequence of pregnancy, tumours, accumulation of fat within 
the abdomen. The muscles may become weak from malnutrition, 
insufficient food, want of exercise, or sedentary habits. Diminution 
of expulsive power may be due to cardiac defects, or the existence 
of fissure of the anus, piles, fistula, or pelvic disease. Portal con- 
gestion arising from cardiac or hepatic disease is apt to cause con- 
stipation from venous congestion, catarrh, haemorrhoids, etc. 

Habit has a powerful influence upon the evacuation of the bowels. 
The introduction of food into the stomach starts a peristaltic action, 
which spreads all along the alimentary canal, and is the cause of 
the matutinal " call of nature." An evacuation, or tendency to 
it, occurs in many persons after each meal Th^ morning evacua- 
tion should be encouraged by all people, and there are many persons 
who are much better in health when an evacuation occurs after the 
midday meal also. An habitual disregard of this " call of nature " 
is an exceedingly common cause of constipation. There are occa- 
sions when it is impossible to respond to it, and such neglect is 
usually followed by discomfort, and perhaps headache for the rest 
of the day. 

Peristalsis is stimulated by the presence of food, particularly by 
the indigestible residue of meat, vegetable fibre, cellulose, sugar, 
organic acids, and salts. Peptones stimulate it feebly, oils more 
strongly, and gases — especiall}' CH4 and SH,— even more power- 
fully. Peristalsis is a steady muscular movement, impalpable, un- 
recognizable, always going on, and capable of becoming a terrific 
force. But it is a matter of " shifts," being accelerated by a meal, 
while abstention from food tends to stasis or constipation. A 
regular defaecation can only be insured by the presence in the colon 
of soft pultaceous faeces permeated by gas. Defaecation is also 
promoted by muscular exercise and hindered by rest. 

Constipation may be obstructive or non-obstructive. The latter 
is due to atonic and spastic conditions. The atonic form is due to 
many causes previously detailed, but especially neglect, anal fissure, 
haemorrhoids, pelvic diseases, loss of power of the voluntary or 
involuntary muscles, visceroptosis, etc. Spastic constipation or 
chronic spasm of the colon is associated with a neurosis dependent 
on toxa;mia. Hertz defines constipation as the retention of faeces 



350 DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES 

more than forty-eight hours, and divides cases into (i) retention 
of fasces above tlie ihac crest, (2) retention below the ihac crest — 
i.e., in the sigmoid flexure and rectum. Arbuthnot Lane speaks 
of constipation as chronic intestinal stasis, and he attributes it 
chiefly to non-inflammatory peritoneal adhesions produced mainly 
bj- the erect posture of man. The caicum and ascending colon 
become dilated and adherent to the posterior wall of the abdomen; 
meanwhile the transverse colon tends to form a loop, the splenic 
flexure and descending colon become fixed to the posterior wall of 
the abdomen; the sigmoid flexure is shortened, its lumen narrowed, 
its muscular coats wasted; and the rectum becomes elongated, dilated, 
and hypertrophied. The stomach dilates, the lumen of the small 
intestine narrows, its muscular coats atrophv, and various loops 
become adherent. These mechanical impediments cause copro- 
stasis, and chronic toxaemia arises from it. The chief seat of toxic 
absorption is the colon, and Lane's remedy is removal or exclusion 
of the colon by anastomosing the ileum with the sigmoid flexure 
or rectum. Colectomy has been performed many times without 
danger to life, and in many instances with benefit. But every case 
of constipation does not require such drastic treatment, and some 
authorities urge it is only necessary in Hirschsprung's disease. 
Goodhart opposes colectom}^ He objects to the theory that the 
colon is a poison-bag and ought to be removed. It performs 
important functions of absorption and elimination. The latter is 
an active casting out of materials which clog the machinery. The 
system cannot do without this cleansing action, and the colon ought 
not to be removed. 

Treatment. — In all cases of constipation it would undoubtedlj' 
be improper to consider the necessity for operative treatment until 
a good chance had been given to improve the condition by means 
of medicine, food, and other measures. Our object now is to dis- 
cuss the dietetic principles of treatment. 

In atony oJ the bowels the diet should be such as will stimulate 
peristalsis- — a cellulose diet. The bread should consist of one of the 
numerous varieties of brown bread, or wholemeal bread, which 
contain far more cellulose than the fine white bread of the modern 
roller mill. Oatmeal should be taken for breakfast or supper, and 
coarse oatmeal or miller's pride is better than fine oatmeal, rolled 
oats, and many other breakfast foods. Oat cakes, Yorkshire parkin, 
oat biscuits, and so forth are especially valuable. Rye bread and buck- 
wheat cakes are other valuable foods for the constipated subject. 
Dried peas, beans, and lentils, leave a large residue, and provide 
material to stimulate the muscular coat of the bowels to activity. 
Currant bread, sultana cakes, ginger-bread, ginger-nuts, French 
parkin; treacle, honey, maple syrup, jam, and especially orange 
marmalade, are stimulants to peristalsis. 

The patient should be encouraged to eat plenty of cabbage, 
savoy, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, spinach, turnips, ruta baga, 
carrots, parsnips, artichokes, .sweet potatoes, potatoes, boiled onions. 



CONSTIPATION 351 

and boiled rolorv. Kidney or string b^-ans. green peas, vegetable 
marrow, and squash are permissible, but of less value, because they 
contain less cellulose. Salads consisting of lettuce, endive, tomato, 
cucumber, radishes, beetroot, watercress, mustard and cress, 
sorrel, dandelion, and other green vegetables, will also assist, 
especially when salad oil is used in the dressing. Puddings should 
be of the " heavy " kind, such as boiled dumplings, suet puddings, 
boiled currant or jam putldings, boiled fruit puddings, hg pudding, 
Yorkshire pudding with treacle or marmalade, pancakes cooked 
in fat. Stewed prunes, hgs. rhubarb, pears, plums, apricots; 
baked apples; currants, gooseberries, and cranberries; in fact, all 
fruits containing seeds will stimulate peristalsis. Dessert may 
consist of practically any raw fruit, the organic acids being a stimu- 
lant to peristalsis: apples, pears, plums, apricots, peaches, goose- 
berries, currants, strawberries, oranges, and grapes Figs and dates 
act largely by virtue of the contained sugars. The " grape cure " 
is recommended, and is of great value in many cases. 

The animal foods may consist of ordinary meat, poultry, game, 
or tish, but the amount should be rather small, taken at the midday 
meal only, and the fatter it is the better it will suit the complaint. 
Fatty foods as a rule are very good, unless they induce " bihous- 
ness " — fat ham and bacon for breakfast and supper, butter, 
cream, and cream cheese. Boiled eggs or hard-boiled eggs are 
considered constipating, but buttered eggs or scrambled eggs are 
laxative by reason of the fat used in cooking. Boiled eggs are not 
constipating to everybody. There are some people who are purged 
by the yolk of one e^^. Soup, broth, and meat extracts are useful 
by promoting secretion. Lactic acid favours the normal functions 
of the bowels, and therefore kephir, koumiss, and other sour-milk 
preparations are good foods. 

Very few of the ordinary articles of food need be forbidden, 
excepting those which leave very httle residue. Cheese is one of 
these articles. Milk should never be taken in large quantity, but 
the small amount required for tea or coffee need not be forbidden. 
Rice, sago, tapioca, arrowroot, and cornflour leave little residue; 
some of them are almost completely, absorbed in the small intestines, 
and therefore they do not leave enough fseces to stimulate peristalsis. 
A few spoonfuls of any ordinary milk pudding may be allowed, 
especially if it is eaten with stewed prunes, figs, marmalade, or other 
cooked fruit, or followed by some rmo fruit. Nuts are generally 
forbidden. Potted meats, hsh pastes, and so forth, are useless; 
but foie gras and even caviar may be taken if they do not cause 
biliousness. All concentrated foods — e.g., milk powders and meat 
powders — are said to induce constipation, because they leave prac- 
tically nothing behind them. 

Beverages. — Constipated people should be encouraged to drink 
plenty of fluids, especially such as have no effect in counteracting 
peristalsis. Ordinary water is one of the best beverages, unless it 
contains an excess of lime. It increases the fluidity of the faeces. 



352 DISFASES OF THE TNTF.STISF.S 

When taken cold, it stimulates peristalsis, and is especiall}' valuable 
if taken before breakfast. It may be taken plain or aerated, and 
sweetened or acidified as desired. Some persons complain that cold 
water causes dyspepsia, and they may drink hot water. Many 
fruit juices or syrups can be added to the water, especially rhubarb 
juice, gooseberry juice, currant juice, plum juice, fig s\Tup, orange 
juice, lemon juice, grape juice. Distilled water may be taken if it 
is preferred. Salutaris may be had plain or aerated. The special 
waters such as Perrier, Apollinaris, Vals, Vichy, Selters, St. Galmier, 
Leamington, Bath, Malvern, Bourne, and others, simply supply 
water with a little alkali ; others are more alkaline, such as Saratoga- 
vichy, Kroenquelle, and Kissingen; and others have mild aperient 
properties, as the Carlsbad water. 

The juices of the grape, apple, pear, and gooseberry form a good 
beverage, and their organic acids stimulate peristalsis. There are 
various "grape juices" on the market — e.g., Vin de ^'ie. Cider 
and perrs', especially " rough cider," is useful. Mead or fermented 
solution of honey is likewise beneficial when it is not too alcoholic. 
New ale, bitter beer, porter, and lager beer may be taken, and are 
somewhat laxative. Whey, buttermilk, and koumiss are recom- 
mended partly because of the lactic acid they contain. Linseed 
tea, barley-water, and oatmeal-water all have a tendency to relax 
the bowels. The morning cup of coffee is laxative to manv persons; 
but tea and cocoa have the opposite tendency, although China tea 
and cocoa made from concentrated essences are permissible. Red 
wines and sherry are more or less constipating, but a little white 
wine^ — e.g., Moselle, Chablis, or Sauterne, may be allowed. 

Spastic constipation, or chronic spasm of the colon, is very often 
associated with conditions that require different treatment from 
atonic constipation. It is necessary to avoid most of the foods 
which are realh' valuable in the former class of cases. It is proper 
to forbid brown bread, oatmeal, coarse fibrous vegetables, salads, 
raw fruit, and cooked fruits which contain seeds. 

On the other hand, the food should be soft, bland, and un- 
irritating, and may be more concentrated. Animal foods should 
be deprived of all skin, gristle, and fibrous tissue. Scraped meat, 
raw meat, and meat juice may be taken. Potted meat, minced 
tongue, and chicken are now useful. Green vegetables should be 
cooked and rubbed through a sieve, and only taken as a puree or 
consomme. Fruit should be deprived of skin and seeds; currants, 
gooseberries, strawberries, and raspberries should be broken down 
and passed through a sieve, and eaten with cream or cream cheese. 
Rice, sago, tapioca, arrowroot, and macaroni are preferable because 
of their bland and unirritating properties, and the small residue from 
them. JeUy of all kinds is useful. Jelly made of agar- agar is 
considered especially valuable. Fermented milk made with cul- 
tures of B. acidi lactici or the Bulgarian bacillus is allowable; 
koumiss and kcphir are useful; cream, cream cheese, butter, eggs, 
boiled or poached, *and rriilk powders, may be used. But it is, 



rnysTi pa ttox 3 3 3 

above all things, necessary that the food sliould Ix: nutritious and 
of a high calorie value. 

• Obstructive Constipation due to til^rous or malignant stricture also 
necessitates tlie use of a diet which will leave very little residue, 
and most of tiie foods prescribed for spastic constipation are per- 
missible. 

A gat'- Agar in Constipation. — -Schmidt found that the stools of 
constipated persons are more or less sterile, and attributed the 
inaction of the bowels to the absence of bacterial products, and 
especially the gases produced by them. He advocated the con- 
sumption of agar-agar as a culture medium for the bacteria. Mendel 
also considers agar-agar valuable in the treatment of constipation 
for other reasons. Agar-agar is obtained from a seaweed, and 
contains simple carbohydrates which are little affected by the 
digestive enzymes. Most of it is e.xcreted unchanged, but it readily 
absorbs and retains water, thereby imparting a soft consistency to 
the faeces and preventing the formation of scybalous masses. Gom- 
pertz ^ prescribed it for thirty patients whose ages varied from 
fifteen to eighty-three years, who suffered from chronic constipa- 
tion, and the majority of whom had never had a motion without 
medicine or encmata. The amount recommended is 15 grammes 
twice daily, the strips being ground into coarse meal, hke modern 
uncooked breakfast foods, and eaten with milk or cream. Regulin 
is a preparation of agar-agar with a small amount of cascara In 
a few cases 15 grammes of agar-agar causes diarrhneal stools, but 
this can be modified by varying the quantity. Regular movements 
begin to occur after two or three days, the evacuations being 
increased in volume, well formed, and of dough-like consistency. 
It is recommended that the agar-agar be taken regularly for three 
months, but gradually reduced in quantity as the stools become 
normal and the activity of the bowels approaches regularity. 

The treatment of constipation includes the cure of the cause, and 
the latter must be sought in every case. If it is a consequence of 
hyperchlorhydria, or other abnormal gastric condition, it should 
be treated as directed under that head. Haemorrhoids, anal fissure, 
ulcers, and similar conditions must be cured. Pelvic diseases 
should have proper attention. Enteroptosis necessitates the use 
of a proper belt. Mechanical causes of constipation should be 
relieved. The formation of regular habits and the adoption of a 
correct posture during defaecation should be inculcated. Abdominal 
massage along the course of the colon is beneficial. The practice of 
Swedish and other muscular movements is valuable, and electricity 
is a useful aid in treatment, either the constant or faradic current 
being employed. If the constant current is used, one electrode, 
6 or 8 inches square, should be placed over the lumbar region, and 
the other, consisting of a disc 2 or 3 inches in diameter, should be 
moved along the colon from right to left.

354 DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES 

Intestinal Catarrh and Colitis. 

Acute catarrh of the small intestines {cntcrilis) is mostly attended 
by diarrha^a. The mucous coat is congested and swollen, large 
quantities of mucus are secreted, and epithelial cells are readily 
detached. The irritation of the mucous membrane causes increased 
peristalsis, and the passage of loose or liquid stools of a pale yellow 
or greenish colour, containing more or less solid matter, particles 
of undigested food, mucus, bacteria, detached portions of epithelium, 
and sometimes blood. A griping colicky pain occurs spasmodically, 
and sometimes vomiting. It usually subsides in a few days with 
the treatment detailed under the head of Diarrhoea. 

Acute catarrh of the colon, called simple colitis, is a catarrhal 
inflammation similar to that of the small intestines. It may be 
primary or secondary. The primary form occurs most commonly 
in children, but it may affect adults, and is always due to micro- 
organisms, bacteria, amoebae, infusoria, of which B. enteritidis 
sporogenes is always present. The main symptom is a sudden onset 
of diarrhoea, but blood and mucus are often present in large quan- 
tities. The movements are frequent; there may be tenesmus; 
much flatus is passed, and borborygmi or rumblings in the bowels 
may occur. Pain of a griping character occurs spasmodically, but 
between the parox^^sms nothing is felt, although there is commonly 
much tenderness of the abdomen, especially along the course of the 
colon, and about the sigmoid flexure in particular. The case may 
be mild, and scarcely give rise to any increase of temperature, but 
severe cases are attended by fever and a soft running pulse. 

Secondary catarrh of the colon may occur in connection with 
various diseases, especially in the course of Bright's disease or 
lardaceous degeneration, the stools being sanious and mucous. It 
occurs sometimes in septicaemia and pyaemia. It arises now and 
again in pneumonia, and may then be due to invasion by the 
pneumococcus. It may be due to direct irritation of the mucous 
membrane b}' Oxyuria and Bilharzia, or powerful irritants, 
such as arsenic and' mercury, and occasionally as an extension of 
such disease in the stomach due to virulent poisons or mineral 
acids. 

The diet in all these cases is that detailed under Diarrhoea or 
Dysentery. Milk, however, should be the chief food, and " milk, 
nothing but milk," until the diarrhoea ceases, blood is no longer 
evacuated, and weU-formed stools are passed, is the rule given by 
many authorities. The quantity of milk given at a time should not 
be more than 2 or 3 ounces, diluted with lime or barley water, and 
the total amount from 3 to 4 pints daily. In severe cases the milk 
diet must be given for many weeks, and the return to ordinary diet 
must be gradual and by easy stages. When the acute symptoms 
pass off, Benger's or Savory and Moore's food, arrowToot, tapioca, 
rice-milk, junket, blanc-mange, then fish, tripe, sweetbread, chicken, 
may be gradually added.

Ulcerative Colitis. — -The colon may Ixm omc ulcerated in dysentery, 
enteric fever, tuberculosis, and malignant disease, but there is a 
special form of ulcerative colitis, to which reference is now made. 
It occurs in men and women, and gives rise to a group of definite 
symptoms, resulting in a very grave state of things and a high rate 
of mortality. It is always attended by pain, diarrhoea, bloody 
stools, and frequently by vomiting. As a general rule the first 
sign of being ill is a severe attack of abdominal pain, frequently 
occurring suddenly, of a griping character, very sharp and severe. 
The pain is not constant, but paroxysmal, the periods of attack 
varying from a few minutes to as many hours. It has no relation 
to the food. It is usually felt in the front of the abdomen, not 
always in the same spot, and may be accompanied bv pain in the 
back, side, or chest. Tenderness is usually absent, unless it be 
along the colon. Diarrhoea is never absent. It may occur before 
the pain, but this is not usual, and it may alternate with constipa- 
tion. The number of movements varies from two to twelve daily. 
Defaecation is attended by pain, but tenesmus and frequent desire 
to defsecate are not so common as in dysentery, neither do the 
stools resemble those of dj^^sentery or cholera. They are nearly 
always foul, fluid, and dark-coloured. Blood is present in them, 
especially after a period of constipation, and it often forms a clot, 
like red-currant jelly. Mucus forming little transparent pellets is 
visible in the motion, and there may be shreds of mucous epithelium, 
which may be broken up or altered by mixture with the intestinal 
contents. Vomiting and nausea sometimes occur. Vomiting may 
be one of the earliest symptoms, but it is not constantly present. 
The cases vary in duration, but the patient always becomes seriously 
ill, wasted, debilitated, and ansemic. The tongue, at first coated 
with a dirty w^hite fur, becomes dry and brown, or clean and red. 
Thirst becomes a prominent symptom, and is induced by the loss 
of fluids from the body. The pulse becomes feeble, haemic murmurs 
arise, and the temperature ranges from ioo° to 102° or 103° F. 
The mortality from ulcerative cohtis is so high that it has been 
said that a recovery throws a doubt upon the nature of the illness. 
The patients usually die in a month or two from the beginning of 
the disease, death being preceded by a high temperature, severe 
diarrhcea, and profuse haemorrhage. 

The cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown. An attempt has been 
made to prove it is dysentery, but the clinical signs are not the 
same. Various micro-organisms have been found associated with 
it. B. dysenteric^ of Shiga have been found in the evacuations, but 
it has been shown that no hard-and-fast definition of this bacillus 
can be given. Dysentery is due to more than one organism, and 
Shiga's bacillus has been found in the diarrhoea of infants, while it 
is not the only bacillus found in ulcerative colitis. 

The Treatment is exceedingly unsatisfactory, because so seldom 
successful. The food should consist of milk, junket, custard, blanc- 
mange, jelly, and predigested carbohydrates. Soup, broth, beef- 



356 DISEASnS OF THE INTESTINES 

tea, and meat extracts should be avoided, and also fruit, vegetables, 
oatmeal, etc. Brandy may be given to the extent of 3 or 4 ounces 
a day. Red wine, and especially whortleberry wine, has been 
suggested. Rectal lavage with | to | pint of boracic lotion, or a 
solution of potassium permanganate, or other antiseptic of a sooth- 
ing character, ma}- be used. Warm applications to the abdomen 
mav be applied, and opium may be given internally. 

Asylum dysentery, another form of colitis, gives rise to symptoms 
like ordinary dvsentery — blood and mucus in the stools. The 
mortality is high; 50 per cent, of cases die. The diet should con- 
sist of milk, junket, custard, jelly, etc. The colon should be irri- 
gated with an antiseptic lotion. 

Chronic Intestinal Catarrh, Mucous Colitis, Membranous Colitis. — 
(i) Chronic catarrh of the intestinal canal occurs in a large number 
of persons who are the subjects of passive congestion arising from 
chronic bronchitis, emphysema, atony of the heart, and other forms 
of heart disease; hkewdse from chronic indigestion, chronic hyper- 
emia of the liver, portal congestion, and obstructive causes in 
general. Such patients may have diarrhoea or constipation, or one 
may alternate with the other. The masses of tough mucus which 
are formed hinder absorption and nutrition, and the patient becomes 
feeble and the general nutrition fails. Many of these cases are 
attended by the decomposition of food in the intestinal canal, with 
distension of the abdomen by gases or distressing flatulence, which 
impedes the breathing and still further obstructs the circulation. 
The general symptoms of catarrh of the alimentary canal are usually 
present. The motor and secreting functions of the stomach may 
or may not be affected, but there is usually a diminution of hydro- 
chloric acid, although no general rule can be laid down. The 
abdomen generally may be tender on pressure, and it is usually 
more or less tender along the course of the colon. Constipation is 
the rule, but does not affect all cases. Catarrh of the small intes- 
tines may be attended with excessive secretion, loud gurgling, and 
rumbling in the abdomen, due to the movements of liquids and 
gases in that area. Such people may have diarrhoea, but con- 
stipation is not uncommon, because the fluids are absorbed in the 
lower part of the gut. 

(2) When the catarrh affects chiefly the colon [nuwous or mem- 
branous colitis), much mucus appears in the stools. In mucous 
colitis, or mucous colic, the patient suffers from chronic constipa- 
tion, but is now and then seized with attacks of violent pain, 
chiefly in the left side, due to a spasm of the colon, which is fol- 
lowed by the passage of large quantities of mucus or mucinoid 
material. The attack lasts a few days, during which time there 
may be frequent stools, attended by the passage of a httle blood, 
which oozes from the mucous surface. In the intervals the health 
of the patient may be pretty good, except for the constipation. 
(3) Membranous colitis may be divided into two groups. In the 
first may be placed all those which are associated with some other 



MUCOUS COLITIS 357 

grave condition, the colon being inflamed and covered with a 
pelhcle or membrane consisting partly of mucous and partly of 
inflammatory exudation. Such a condition occurs occasionally in 
the course of specilic fevers, pyaemia, pneumonia, Bright's disease, 
and from the effect of powerful irritant poisons. The other group, 
whicli is of more interest to us, includes all those cases connected 
with a considerable amount of dyspepsia and the passage of " skins " 
or membranes. 

The cause of membranous colitis has not been definitely settled. 
It is considered by some authorities that its origin is due to inflam- 
matory changes. This is supported by the fact that over 40 per 
cent, of the cases are associated with diseases of the pelvic organs, 
such as dysmenorrhcea, membranous dysmenorrhoea, endometritis, 
pelvic cellulitis, etc., which suggest a local origin for the disease. 
The almost constant association of constipation with the disease 
suggests that its origin lies with the intestinal atony. It is urged 
in support of this theory that all the successful modes of treatment 
depend upon keeping the colon empty. Against this theory is the 
fact that constipation is an exceedingly common complaint, whereas 
membranous colitis is comparatively rare. The frequent associa- 
tion of the disease with neurasthenia, hysteria, or hypochondriasis, 
has suggested that membranous and mucous colitis are primarily 
due to the nervous disorder. Xothnagel considers the disease 
primarily a nervous disorder, with an excessive secretion of mucus 
from the colon as a symptom. Ewald says colica mucosa is a 
myxoneurosis. The neurotic origin of the disease is founded on 
the following facts: (i) The disease affects persons of a neurotic 
disposition; (2) an attack of mucous colic can be brought on by 
severe emotion; (3) inflammatory diseases of the colon do not 
cause such a profuse discharge of mucus as occurs in this disease; 
(4) the post-mortem examination of persons known to have suffered 
from the disease is against the inflammatory origin. It is possible 
that the symptoms of the disease occur as a vicious circle. Be- 
ginning with enfeebled nervous system, there first arises the atony 
of the muscular coat of the bowels, which leads to constipation. 
The frequent delay in the passage of faeces permits the absorption 
of products of protein decomposition which poison the nervous 
system and cause neurasthenia, and the neurosis gives rise to the 
perverted secretion of mucus. The intestinal bacteria are of two 
kinds: those which act upon carbohydrates and produce lactic, 
acetic, butyric, and succinic acids; and those which act upon and 
decompose proteins. The former are confined more or less to the 
small intestines; the latter to the colon, and chiefly to the lower 
two-thirds. But there is an intermediate region, consisting of the 
caecum and ascending colon, where both kinds of bacteria flourish 
even in health. In the normal condition the protein-decomposing 
bacteria do not extend above the ileo-csecal valve; but in patho- 
logical conditions they do extend above this region, and become 
exceedingly active, whence arises the decomposition of proteins 



3?8 DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES 

and absorption of the toxins arising therefrom. Mucus is the 
natural lubricant of the colon, and is necessary to facilitate the 
expulsion of faeces. A diminished secretion is considered to 
contribute to the causation of constipation; but an excessive 
secretion is abnormal and pathological, and especially where the 
character of the secretion becomes altered so as to form " skins," 
and the large flakes of laminated material which characterize 
membranous colitis. 

The disease, however, is rarely fatal; but it drags through a pro- 
longed period, and the patient may die through some intercurrent 
affection. Providing the latter is avoided, the patient may get 
well; the disease may be cured. But very many patients suffer 
for years before proper treatment is begun, and such delay dimin- 
ishes the prospects of complete recover}^ Moreover, about half 
the persons affected get well. Men do better than women. Most 
of the patients require a long and patient treatment. If patients 
neglect their treatment, the disease goes from bad to worse. They 
become thinner, paler, more anaemic, and feebler; they alternately 
lie in bed, too ill to move, or occupy themselves in going from one 
health-resort to another, and their existence becomes miserable. 
There are, in fact, few chronic diseases which have a wider 
ramification and produce more serious ill-health than membranous 
colitis. 

With regard to Treatment.— The diet is of the utmost importance, 
but the form depends upon our view of the aetiology. If, from our 
consideration of the case, we have concluded that the enteric 
catarrh, mucous or membranous colitis, had its origin in congestive 
or inflammatory processes, it is clear that the food must not consist 
of those articles which have been recommended for constipation. 
On the other hand, we must prescribe substances which will leave 
no irritating residue. It is possible that a course of Fletcherism 
{q.v.) might be beneficial. At any rate, nothing should be swal- 
lowed that is not reduced by the teeth to a consistency fine enough 
to pass through a sieve. Indeed, it is sometimes necessary to 
interdict the consumption of food which has not been passed through 
a sieve. It is necessary, above all things, that the patient should 
avoid all " skins and bones, strings and stones." Thus, the skin 
and fibrous portions should be removed from meat, fowl, fish; the 
scales should be carefully removed from sardines (if they are eaten) ; 
all bones and spicula of bones must be avoided. The skins of 
potato, tomato, grapes and other fruit must be removed; also the 
white or pulpy portion of oranges, the strings taken out of various 
fruits, the skins removed from the interior of apples. The seeds 
must be removed from grapes, currants, strawberries, gooseberries, 
figs, and all other fruit. The patient must avoid fibrous vegetables, 
such as cabbage, savoy, Brussels sprouts, turnips, swedes {Ruta 
baga), parsnips, and carrots, unless they have been reduced to a 
puree. Also brown bread of all kinds, rye bread, oatmeal, new 
bread, crust of bread, dry toast, hot buttered toast, muffins, crum- 



MUCOUS COLITIS 359 

pets, pastry, boiled puddings, nuts of every kind, dried currants, 
raisins, candied fruits, peas and beans, salted meat or fish, hard- 
boiled eggs, cheese, sardines, pilchards, whitebait. 

The food may consist of the following articles, and should be 
taken in abundance, so as to renovate the organism and increase 
the muscular energy. All kinds of fresh meat, fowl, and fish may 
be allowed, with the foregoing proviso — i.e., after removing skin, 
gristle, and bone, and resorting to extremely careful mastication, 
riie gravy from any kind of meat may be taken, unless diarrhoea 
is a marked feature of the case. Ox or calf's tongue, potted meat, 
scraped meat, chicken souffle, and similar articles are very useful 
foods. Raw and soft-boiled eggs are equally suitable. Sole, plaice, 
whiting, turbot, and brill are suitable fishes, care being taken to 
avoid skins and bones. As the treatment progresses, beef or 
mutton which has not been scraped or minced may be taken if 
every particle of skin and fibrous tissue is removed. 

Plain white bread (avoiding crust) is always permissible, but it 
should be stale and good. Bread-and-butter, plain biscuits or 
crackers, rusks, Madeira cake (without fruit), and sponge cake may 
also be taken. 

The vegetables allowable are vegetable marrow, spinach, well- 
mashed potato or potato puree, and any other vegetable which has 
been rubbed through a fine sieve. The patient may have a con- 
siderable amount of fruit if care is taken to avoid indigestible 
residues. Cooked apples and plums or peaches are easily prepared. 
Strawberries, raspberries, currants, and gooseberries can be reduced 
to a pulp and passed through a sieve, to be eaten with cream and 
sugar or with blanc-mange or milk pudding. The soft part of 
oranges can be eaten; grapes can be freed from skins and 
stones; bananas can also be freed from skin and the string in the 
centre. 

Puddings consisting of rice, sago, tapioca, rendered quite soft, 
are useful. Custard, junket, blanc-mange, and all kinds of jelly 
leave little residue. Jelly made of agar- agar is permissible. 
Farinaceous foods, such as Benger's, Savory and Moore's, and many 
others, may be consumed. The casein preparations may all be 
used. Honey, treacle, fruit-s}Tups, black currant jell}', apple jelly, 
quince jelly, can all be allowed. 

Soups are permissible if they are carefully prepared. Any kind 
of ineat or fowl can be used in their manufacture. All kinds of 
vegetables or pot-herbs can be used in the preparation of such 
soups, but they should then be removed. The soup, however, 
may be thickened if it is desired, and vermicelli or macaroni 
may be cooked and eaten with it ; or the soup may be made of 
stock flavoured with essence of celer}', tomato sauce, or mushroom 
ketchup. 

If diarrhoea is a marked feature of the case, or occurs in the 
course of the disease, it is necessary to stop all soups, beef-tea, 
meat essences, meat jelly, vegetables, and fruit. Milk should then 



360 DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES 

be the staple food, but even this does not always agree with the 
patient. When milk does not agree, the patient may have a 
farinaceous gruel made of Benger's or Savor}' and Moore's food, 
baked wheat-fiour, biscuit-powder, fine oatmeal, arrowroot, tapioca, 
or sago cooked to a jelly, some form of milk-powder (Sanatogen or 
Plasmon) being added to supply protein. After a day or two of 
this diet the white of an egg may be given two or three times a 
day in arrowroot gruel or lemon-water, and followed by Brand's 
essence, Valentine's meat juice, or Mosquera's beef jelly. As the 
diarrhoea subsides, an experiment can be made with a httle scraped 
meat or chicken panada, and if these are borne well, we may then 
pass along to boiled tongue, boiled tripe, a portion of sole or plaice, 
and thenceforward get on the foregoing diet list. 

If, on the other hand, we have concluded that the predominating 
feature in the setiology is a neurotic condition, and if we have ascer- 
tained that the commonl}^ associated pelvic and other inflammatory 
troubles are absent, we should adopt another course. The best 
dietary to adopt in such cases is the cellulose diet recommended by 
Von Noorden. This has been given in the chapter on Special Diets. 
Von Noorden prescribes a diet consisting of | pound of Graham 
bread, with all kinds of legumes, such as dried peas and beans, 
vegetables containing much fibre, and an abundance of fruits having 
thick skins and a large quantity of seeds (grapes, currants, straw- 
berries, gooseberries, and blackberries), plenty of fat, such as 
butter, bacon, fat ham, and fat meat. He claims that with this 
diet 50 per cent, of the cases are permanently cured, and another 
28 per cent, are greatly improved. The food should be a lacto- 
vegetarian diet having the following basis: Milk 2 pints, eggs two 
or three, brown bread 8 ounces, butter 2 ounces, fat meat, fat ham 
or bacon. The following combination may be suggested: 

Breakfast. — Hot water, ^ pint, while dressing. Coffee or China tea, cream; 
brown bread-and-butter; oatmeal porridge, with cream and demerara sugar; 
light fish; fat ham or bacon; or eggs, scrambled or poached ; jam, marmalade, 
honey, treacle; raw fruit. 

Ltinch. — Glass of milk and oatmeal biscuits or parkin. 

Midday. — Omelette, buttered or scrambled eggs; or fat meat. Bread-and- 
butter. Artichokes, tomatoes, green salads, cabbage, savoy, cauliflower, 
spinach, turnips, swedes. Raw or cooked fruit, the following combinations 
being useful: Apples, walnuts and figs; pears, hazel-nuts, and dates; prunes, 
bananas, and brazil nuts; grapes, brazil nuts, and figs ; strawberries, walnuts, 
and dates; blackberries, peanuts, and pears; bananas, figs, and ha^el nuts. 
Cooked fruit may be eaten with cream. 

Tea. — China tea, cream ; currant cake. 

Dinner. — Similar to midday meal. Boiled peas and beans may be used in 
alteration with fruit and nuts! 

The food must be abundant, or in sufficient amount to yield 
not less than 70 grammes of protein and 2,000 calories. The 
Ainfortunate part about such patients is that their appetite is small, 
they soon feel full, and there is a danger that such persons may 
delude themselves that they are doing well if they take a glassful

MUCOUS COLITIS 361 

or two of milk and little raw fruit. If this treatment is prescribed, 
it must be carried out completely, for half measures are worse than 
useless, and simply lead to an aggravation of the neurotic condi- 
tion and its attendant state of subnutrition. The disease can only 
be cured by raising the tone of the body, improving nutrition, and 
correcting the constipation. Obviously, a cellulose diet is unsuit- 
able in cases of enteric catarrh attended by diarrhcjea; but in a 
large number of non-ulcerative cases, such as mucous and mem- 
branous colitis, the lacto- vegetarian or milk and fruit diet is very 
successful. 

All cases present difficulties, and therefore it is impossible to 
prescribe the cellulose diet to everyone. For instance, there may 
be a chronic gastric catarrh or a gastric neurosis, which prevents 
the use of such a diet. In others, a coarse cellulose diet, containing 
peas, beans, and librous vegetables, may precipitate the attacks of 
mucous colic. In such cases a diet consisting of fruit and milk and 
eggs may be beneficial — e.g., 2 or 3 pints of milk, two or three 
eggs, with cooked apples, pears, plums, prunes, bananas, grapes 
freed from seeds, dates, and nuts ground in a mill. Even this 
may be too irritating, and the case is one which can only be 
treated by a diet as free as possible from residue or by a course of 
Fletcherism. 

In very severe cases it may be necessary to prescribe absolute 
rest in bed, with warm applications to the abdomen and occasional 
injections of morphine. The use of narcotics, however, should be 
avoided as much as possible, and they should never be given into 
the hands of the patient, because they increase the constipation, 
and sufferers from mucous or membranous colitis are very prone 
to use them freely, and a condition of morphinomania may be 
induced. 

The colon must be kept empty, for very little improvement can 
be made while constipation remains. Castor oil (gss. to 3!. every 
morning) is, perhaps, the most useful aperient; but calomel fol- 
lowed by an aperient water is also useful in many cases. What- 
ever aperient is found to agree must be taken for months together. 
The use of agar-agar or regulin may also be tried. Pure petroleum 
is useful in many cases (see Constipation). If these measures fail, 
resort must be had to intestinal lavage, which is best carried out at 
Plombieres with the water of the place. Lavage can be carried 
out at home with a pint or two of plain water or a solution of 
common salt and bicarbonate of soda at 104° F. ; but lavage of the 
bowels is seldom so successful when carried out in this country as 
when done at Plombieres, whence it must be concluded that the 
special water of that place has a curative value. 

Hot baths, followed by massage, electricity, and abdominal exer- 
cises, are all useful to improve the circulation; and a wet pack or 
compress worn over the abdomen, and bound on by a flannel 
bandage every night, is beneficial. Priessnitz recommends a 
similar compress. 



362 DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES 

Some form of occupation must be found for the patient. Such 
people are always worse when they have nothing to do. An out- 
of-door life is beneficial, but the amount and kind of exercise must 
depend upon their condition and the nature of the case. Tennis, 
badminton, golf, walking, and riding are useful for increasing mus- 
cular tone, encouraging appetite, improving the circulation, and 
stimulating peristalsis; but obviously these exercises are too severe 
for all cases. If diarrhoea prevails, quietness should be the rule, 
fresh air being taken by riding in a carriage, sitting in a garden, 
or a sea voyage. Above all things, the patient must not be allowed 
to be solitary. Changes of place and scenery are useful b}^ taking 
the patient's attention from themselves, and they are still more 
useful if the air is bracing, as upon the sea, or the mountainous 
districts of Wales, Norway, or Switzerland. 

When all other means have failed, and the suffering is so great 
as to render life a burden, the colon may be opened on the right 
side to allow the faeces to come through an artificial anus for a few 
months, and give rest to the diseased bowels. The opening may 
then be closed up. This treatment was first adopted by Hale 
White and Golding Bird in 1895. It has since been followed by 
many operators, and is often successful in curing membranous 
colitis. The objections to the operation are — The faeces are 
often so fluid that it is impossible to keep the patient clean; the 
irritation of the faeces makes the skin sore; when the disease has 
lasted many years, the neurotic condition often remains after the 
membranous colitis is cured. When these things are explained to 
the patient beforehand, she frequently prefers the evils she knows 
to those which are unknown. Some surgeons perform appendicos- 
tomy — that is, they cut off the end of the appendix, and sew it to 
the edges of the skin. The object of this operation is to provide 
an opening through which the colon can be washed daily with a 
boracic or other lotion, thus keeping the colon clean and empty. 
Hale White considers that with a right-sided colotomy there is no 
need to syringe through the artificial anus to the rectum. Other 
surgeons, including Arbuthnot Lane, prefer to join the ileum to 
the rectum, thereby short-circuiting the bowel, or even to remove 
the entire colon. One of the main objections to this operation is 
that the rectum itself may be badly diseased or the only part 
w'hich is diseased, and it may be difficult to implant the ileum 
below the diseased part, and therefore colotomy or appendicostomy 
is preferable. Hertz considers that removal of the colon is un- 
necessary in any condition except Hirschsprung's disease. The 
latter is an idiopathic dilatation of the colon, which begins in early 
life. It is an uncommon affection. The dilatation may extend 
from the caecum to the anus, and is probably one of the forms of 
" phantom tumour." Out of twenty- four cases collected by Crozier 
Griffith, only three reached adult life; but it is possible that slight 
cases may occur, and form the elderly group which has been re- 
corded. The dilatation of the colon may become extreme. The 



IflRSCHSPRUNG'S DISEASE 363 

eibdomcn, however, is usually distended, but the greatest disten- 
sion is usually in the ihac fossa. The distension impedes the 
breathing, and causes lividity by hampering the action of the 
heart and organs of respiration. The hepatic dulness is dimin- 
ished, and the liver cannot be felt. Peristaltic movements are 
visible, and the change in the shape of the abdomen can be seen 
slowly taking place. The condition renders life burdensome. 
Death often arises from colitis or ulcers, which may become per- 
forated. The removal of the colon is the only treatment likely to 
be beneficial. 



CHAPTER XI 

DISEASES OF THE LIVER 

The liver is the largest gland in the body, and its functions are 
multifarious. It is easily understood that such an organ maybe 
upset in many ways, and the nutrition and metabolic processes of 
the body unbalanced, because so important an organ is thrown out 
of gear. It is not eas}^ to test the hepatic efficiency by physical 
methods; and perhaps the best means of doing so is to observe the 
relation which exists between the amount of bile in the faeces and 
urine. The occurrence of little bile in the urine coincident with a 
marked deficiency of bile in the faeces would indicate a high degree 
of hepatic insufficiency. A normal amount of bile in f?eces, coupled 
with a slight increase of bile in the urine, would indicate a slight 
insufficienc\- of the liver. Absence of bile from the faeces and excess 
of bile in the urine would indicate insufficiency of bile due to 
catarrhal or other obstruction of the bile channels; and the presence 
of bile in the faeces, coupled with excess of bile in the urine, would 
indicate some disease of the liver, but not biliary insufficiency. 

Torpor of the Liver is the most common liver complaint. The 
organ is slow in performing its normal functions, and tends to become 
choked with bile, glycogen, and urea. It has a marked tendency to 
run into chronic congestion of the liver. There is a normal in- 
crease in the amount of blood in the liver after each meal. This is 
physiological. But when persons eat and drink immoderately, 
the ph\-siological fluxion becomes excessive, continues longer, and, 
being often repeated, tends to cause a permanent dilatation of the 
bloodvessels. Moreover, the fluxion may be aggravated by " a 
chill," when an acute congestion or pathological hyperaemia occurs 
in a small or large area of the liver; or the fluxion may be aggra- 
vated b}- an irritation of the parenchyma of the liver by alcohol and 
spices. The parenchyma is affected so much by alcohol in the 
blood of the portal vein that it offers but slight resistance to the 
dilating vessels. Uhi irritatio ihi fluxus : This is apparent when 
mustard, horseradish, pepper, ca3-enne, and other irritants are 
apphed to the skin, and probably holds good in the liver. But 
the chronic congestion of the liver which occurs in heart disease, 
chronic bronchitis, pleurisy, and other obstructive diseases, arises 
from passive hyperaemia, due to backward pressure, whereby the 
vessels of the liver are mechanically distended. The influence of 
excessive eating and the use of spices and alcohol in causing chronic 

364 



TORPfD LIVER 365 

hyperremia of the liver has been referred to. There are other effects. 
In all chronically inflamed organs the amount of fibrous tissue 
becomes greatly increased. The liver is no exception to the rule, 
and the formation of new hbrous tissue is a very prominent factor 
in cirrhosis. We ought to consider the nature of the irritant which 
induces this hbrosis. As the disease is spread throughout the liver, 
the irritant must be something in the blood circulating through it. 
The name " gin-drinker's liver " involves the view that alcohol 
is the common irritant; but it is known that ether, chloroform, 
phosphorus, and other irritants will produce the same effect. 
Alcohol in the form of spirits is the usual cause; wine and beer do 
not often cause it. But other causes are indicated from the fact 
that the disease occurs in animals and children who have never 
tasted alcohol. A case of typical cirrhosis was observed in a 
butcher's cat, which suggests that the disease was due to excessive 
eating. It is probable that alcoliol is not the sole cause of cirrhosis, 
but that it is due to toxins which cause prohferation of the con- 
nective-tissue cells, and these may include toxins from meat, butyric 
acid, etc. In the early stage of cirrhosis the new tissue is abun- 
dantly cellular, like granulation tissue. Horsley expresses the 
opinion that " if the irritant [alcohol] is removed after being used 
a short time only, the liver will go back to what it was before the 
irritation occurred ; the new cells will disappear. But if the irritant 
be applied again and again, small quantities of alcohol constantly 
filtering through the hver, a time comes when these cells settle down 
into permanent fibrous-tissue cells, or ' scar tissue.' A peculiarity 
of scar tissue is that it can never be removed." The areas of 
hepatic tissue encroached on by the new formation undergo fatty 
degeneration by being deprived of nutriment. This fatty change 
is different from fatty infiltration. The latter occurs in conditions 
like obesity and other forms of defective metabolism, such as arise 
from beer-drinking, sedentary occupations, luxurious habits, living 
and working in hot and badly ventilated rooms, and the absence of 
fresh air and muscular exercise. 

The treatment of torpid liver is by medicinal, hygienic, and 
dietetic measures. The li\'er may be influenced in many ways. 
Abstinence from food for a short time will help to relieve the tor- 
pidity by making demands on the hver to supply the organism with 
glycogen. We can prevent any increase in the accumulation of 
nitrogenous waste products by withholding protein foods. By 
sweeping the intestinal canal of its entire contents, we can provoke 
the liver to activity in supplying glycogen for the tissues and bile 
for digestion. The liver cells can be stimulated to biliary activity 
by various drugs, and the vis d tergo will cleanse the hepatic ducts 
and bile channels of the materials accumulated during the period 
of torpidity. The large watery stools induced by free purgation 
relieves the pressure in the portal veins, increases the diuresis and 
excretion of urea and other products of protein metabolism, and 
relieves the system in general. 



366 DISEASES OF THE LIVER 

The dietar\' for torpid liver, or " liver complaint " is much the 
same as for indigestion. If there is a deficiency in the secretion 
of bile, it is obviously better to avoid fatty foods, especially foods 
cooked in fat, and goose, duck, pork, fat bacon, or other articles 
containing very much fat. The aromatic spices and condiments, 
such as mustard, pepper, horseradish, ginger, cayenne, cloves, 
mace, nutmeg, etc., should all be avoided, because of their effect 
on the portal circulation. An excess of alcohol must be avoided, 
because it is directly irritating to the hepatic structures. The total 
dietary should be temporarily reduced to about i,8oo or 2,000 
calories, including at most 80 grammes of protein, 40 grammes of 
fat, and 280 to 300 grammes of carbohydrate. It should be selected 
from the following articles: 

Soups. — Vegetable soup or light clear broth, containing little extractive 
matters, and made chiefly of leeks, onions, celery, turnips, carrots, mint or 
thyme, and bones. 

Fish. — Sole, plaice, whiting or haddock; boiled cod, bass, perch, pike, brill, 
skate, or flounder ; raw oysters. 

Meat. — Tender mutton, lamb, chicken, pheasant, or rabbit. These foods 
should be boiled, as that method of cooking removes a considerable proportion 
of the extractives. 

Carbohydrates. — White or brown bread, dry toast, rusks, or rolls; plain 
milk puddings, custard (no jelly), blanc-mange; potatoes, cabbage, cauli 
flower, spinach, Brussels sprouts; endive, lettuce, tomatoes; and fruit may 
form part of the dietary. 

Hygienic measures must be adopted. In particular, it is 
necessar}' to take plenty of muscular exercise; to live in well- 
ventilated rooms, not overheated; to drink plenty of water and 
other simple beverages. Massage of the liver is sometimes very 
benelicial. 

The treatment of a " bilious attack " is very simple. The name 
is unsatisfactory, and conveys little information. A bilious attack 
is usually due to gastro-duodenal catarrh, associated with acute 
hyperaemia of the liver. It frequently follows dietetic excesses, but 
may be purely the result of chill, and is often of bacterial origin. 
The headache, vomiting, and general malaise necessitate starvation 
for twenty-four hours, and the use of calomel and sahnes to clear the 
alimentary canal of bile and food residues. On the following two 
days the food should consist of milk, oatmeal, hominy, light fish or 
chicken, milk puddings, junket or custard, toast or rusks. The 
subsequent treatment should be that of " liver complaint." 

The treatment of a liver chill consists of rest in bed and the use 
of means to relieve pain and febrile symptoms. The application 
of cotton-wool, poultices, or a counter-irritant, over the hepatic 
area will be found soothing. A few leeches to the anus afford 
relief by withdrawing blood from the portal veins. The same 
effect follows the action of a strong saline aperient, which 
relieves the portal system by the removal of water. The food 
must be unstimulating and unirritating. Milk is the food least 
irritating to the alimentary canal, and it contains practically no 



rriRnyir nvPFR.^MiA nr the ijvfr 367 

extractives which could irritate the hver. An abundance of 
liquid would be useful by making the bile more fluid, and 
the presence of sodium salts would hkcwise encourage a flow of 
thin bile. It is therefore advisable to dilute the milk with Vichy, 
Vals, Ems. or Apollinaris water, or, in their absence, by ordinary 
soda-water. A little lish of a light character, preferably boiled to 
remove extractives, may be allowed, and it may be accompanied 
by cabbage, cauliflower, spinach, vegetable marrow, or French beans. 
Bread-and-butter, milk puddings, and weak tea are allowable in 
moderation; but the food must be small in quantity until the con- 
gestion has passed away. It should be reduced to the physiological 
minimum — 1,500 or 1,600 calorics for at least two days — -and the 
diet should include not less than 2 pints of milk. If the patient 
wants more food, let him have a jelly made of agar-agar (Chinese 
gelatin), prepared with a fruit flavouring, or eaten with a little 
cooked fruit. A few strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, or a 
roasted apple or two are also permissible ; but fruits which contain 
much starch, such as bananas, and potatoes, should be avoided. 
Ordinary gelatin and jelly made therefrom — e.g., calf's-foot jelly 
and jelly tablets — are not permissible. Gelatin is a nitrogenous 
body, but the nitrogen does not spare the tissues very much; 
it is of no more value in most cases of sickness than carbo- 
hydrates; indeed, the amino-acids are split off during assimilation 
and immediately carried to the liver for transformation into urea. 
Agar-agar is scarcely digested at all, and merely satisfies the stomach 
by giving it something to act upon. 

In hyperaemia due to fluxion of blood to the liver, as a consequence 
of immoderate eating or drinking, the excessive use of condiments, 
spices, or alcohol, the dietary and habits of the patient must be 
rearranged. Instead of luxurious living, the diet must be plain and 
spare. It is particularly desirable that alcohol should be reduced 
in amount or forbidden altogether; mustard, pepper, capsicum, 
horseradish, and other spices which cause an afflux of blood to 
the liver, must be forbidden. The dietary which has been recom- 
mended to be eaten and the articles to be avoided in indigestion 
and chronic gastric catarrh are applicable in the treatment of this 
complaint. The amount of protein should be reduced — for some 
time, at any rate — to the physiological requirement ; and in no case 
should it exceed 70 or 80 grammes a day vmtil the liver has attained 
something approaching to the normal condition. " Rich " and 
fatty foods should be avoided, because they tend to aggravate the 
general catarrhal condition of the alimentary organs. But as 
50 per cent, of the fat reaches the circulation through the lymphatics 
and not through the liver, there is no reason for reducing the amount 
of fat below 100 grammes daily, and it should be taken in the form 
of butter, cream, and fat meat. The carboh^^drates should be given 
in the form of bread, milk pudding, and fruit; it should be reduced 
to 240 or 280 grammes. With 70 or 80 grammes of protein and 100 
grammes of fat, the diet will yield a total of 2,000 to 2,200 calories a 



368 DISEASES OF THE LIVER 

day. The consumption of alcohol has to be considered most carefully . 
It ought to be done without altogether, but a good deal depends on 
the condition of the patient. Malt liquors and spirits are par- 
ticularly forbidden. But wine, such as moselle, hock, sillery, 
Burgundy, or red Hungarian wine, is permissible with the meals. 
It should be understood that the amount is to be strictly limited — • 
two wineglassfuls at the most. Hygienic measures are of impor- 
tance. Fresh air and exercise are essential. The patient who has 
been accustomed to ride in a carriage should be recommended to 
walk. Golf is an extremely useful means of getting fresh air and 
exercise. Tennis, badminton, bowls, quoits, and walking, are also 
useful means of exercise. The importance of the muscles for de- 
stroying uric acid and other waste products has been established. 
The ventilation of the rooms occupied by the individual when at 
home or in the office should receive due attention. Other remedial 
measures should not be neglected. Brisk purgation clears the ali- 
mentary canal of bile and imperfectly digested food, relieves the 
congestion of the portal vessels, stimulates absorption and bile 
formation. The activity of the liver is thereby stimulated, and the 
accumulated products of metabolism are reduced to urea. Nothing 
surpasses the alkaline-sulphate or saline purgative waters for this 
purpose. The sulphates encourage the bihary secretion and 
relieve the lateral pressure in the portal system by depleting the 
intestinal veins. The sodium salts enter the blood, and being 
excreted by the kidneys, promote urea excretion, and thereby relieve 
the liver. The alkaline carbonates neutralize excess of uric acid, 
and remove it from the body in the urine. The waters most suitable 
for these purposes are those of Harrogate and Leamington, in 
England; Marienbad, Homburg, Carlsbad, and Kissingen, on the 
continent of Europe; and those of Saratoga- Vichy and Hot Springs 
of Arkansas, in the United States. All these waters may be used 
for a long time without injury. 

We have still to consider that large group of cases of. hyperaemia 
of the liver due to passive congestion, arising from diseases of the 
thoracic viscera. In a considerable number of cardiac cases the 
cause of the hypersemia is a combination of those which have been 
detailed under Fluxion and Congestion. Thus, cardiac myasthenia, 
fatty heart, and the S3'mptoms arising from valvular diseases, may 
all be aggravated by alcohol, condiments, spices, overeating, and 
overdrinking. The patients are usually inactive or slow in their 
movements, and many of them are unable to be otherwise. They 
suffer from dyspnoea, and sometimes a slight, or even a well-marked, 
cyanosis. They may have cedema of their feet and ankles, possibly 
some ascites, alternate diarrhoea and constipation, or haemorrhoids. 
Their appetite is usually poor; the symptoms of gastro-intestinal 
catarrh are evident. Such patients may be fleshy, but their flesh 
is flabby, and probably contains much water. It is not what is 
considered healthy fat. Their condition as a rule is more serious 
than in the former group of cases, and they often have to take to 



HYPEREMIA Of Till-: LIVIiR 3O9 

their bed for a few weeks owing to the state of their heart, bron- 
chitis and emphysema, an attack of subacute gastritis, or acute 
gastro-enteric cat;u-rh. 

In consequence of their debihtated condition, their inactivity, 
poor appetite, and enfeebled nutrition, the treatment already out- 
lined has to be modified. It is frequently necessary to put them 
upon a milk diet, with Benger's, Savory and Moore's, or other 
foods, which require no mastication, and are consumed in a fluid 
or semitluid condition, and are easily digested. It may be neces- 
sary to put them on absolute milk diet or skim milk for a week or 
two. But in the majority of cases any food made with milk is 
good for them — e.g., bread and milk, custard, junket, milk jeUy, 
isinglass and milk, oatmeal and milk, and milk puddings. Eggs — • 
poached, lightly boiled, or raw — -are useful if they do not cause 
diarrhoea; but scrambled eggs or " buttered eggs " and other greasy 
foods are forbidden. The amount of protein should be not less 
than 80 grammes daily, if the patient can be persuaded to take it, 
and the whole dietary should yield not less than 2,000 calories. 
These weakly patients require to be " built up." Moreover, the 
proteins should be unassociated with extractives and purin bodies 
as far as possible. For this reason milk and eggs are the best 
sources. When the digestion is improved, and the appetite in- 
creased, some of the milk can be replaced by other protein foods of 
a light character, such as tripe, boiled cod, sole, plaice, whiting, 
fresh haddock, and, later on, mutton (boiled with flavouring vege- 
tables and herbs, or with caper sauce), and boiled fowl or rabbit. 
A moderate amount of butter or fat meat will do no harm ; but foods 
usually called " rich," or fried in fat, must not be given. Vegetable 
soup is also permissible, but not meat soup. The carbohydrates 
may consist of milk, sugar in tea or cocoa, bread, milk puddings, 
and a little fruit, such as grapes, oranges, strawberries, raspberries, 
bananas, and pineapple. Ordinary tea and coffee should be ex- 
cluded from the dietary, but the patient may have a little China 
tea, or coffee free from caffein, or some form of imitation coffee 
(fig coffee, cereal coffee, dandelion coffee, etc.). Tea and cocoa 
should be made with milk. It is better to exclude alcohol, unless 
some special symptoms necessitate its use. In such a case a glass 
of really good sherry, or a httle old and genuine brandy, well 
diluted, may be permitted once or twice a day. As a rule the 
amount allowed must be small, and strictly hmited by the medical 
attendant. 

When the patient is sufficiently recovered to return to ordinary 
diet, the greatest possible care must be used as regards the articles 
permitted. All those articles which foster hepatic hyperaemia by 
causing an afflux of blood to that organ or by irritating the paren- 
chyma, must be avoided. In particular, alcohol, spices, condi- 
ments, sauces, pickles, and all foods cooked in fat must be ex- 
cluded. To these should be added strong soup or broth, aU kinds 
of extract of meat, liver, kidneys, spleen, brain, sweetbread, high

game, pork, veal, sausage, duck, goose, hashed meat, dried and 
salted meat, heavy kinds of fish — e.g., mackerel, herring, salmon, 
saJmon-trout, eels, lamprey, butterfish, catfish, ciscoe, halibut, 
mullet, pompano, shad, trout, and wliitefish — cheese, heavy vege- 
tables — e.g., carrots, turnips, parsnips, swedes, cabbage, yams, 
dried peas and beans — and fruit containing many seeds, such as 
gooseberries, currants, cranberries, figs, etc. 

The liver may be relieved to some extent by the use of Carlsbad. 
Marienbad, Friedrichshall, and similar waters. If the patient 
can travel, he may be sent to Harrogate, Leamington, or one of 
the Continental spas. It is obvious that such persons will not be 
able to take active exercise, but they must go into the fresh air 
whenever they can, should walk when they are able to do so, and 
when they cannot walk, should ride in an open carriage. 

\Micn considering the diet suitable for hepatic disorders, Emil 
Schwarz^ took into consideration the influence of the liver itself. 
He sa3's the influences exerted by the liver on albuminous, 
starchy, and fatty foods, and on the final products of nitrogenous 
metabolism, are not independent processes, but are the final stage 
of a complicated process, taking place in the cells of the liver. 
Therefore, when the parenchyma is affected, all these processes 
suffer simultaneously, if not equally. But it is only in the most 
acute hepatic diseases (acute yellow atrophy of the liver and phos- 
phorus-poisoning) that intoxication occurs from the products 
arising at the end of digestion or metabolism. In chronic diseases 
of the liver it is only in the final stages that metabolism suffers. 
Therefore Schwarz sees in the liver itself no reason for diminishing 
either the nitrogenous or amylaceous foods, or even the fatty foods, 
unless there is jaundice. But the digestive tract is involved in a 
catarrhal process arising primarily from the ingesta which have 
caused the hepatic disease — e.g., alcohol— and secondly from portal 
congestion, which causes a delay in absorption. The surface 
available for absorption is reduced, often as much as one-half, 
by the catarrh and atrophy of the mucous membrane arising from 
periphlebitis of the portal system and chronic peritonitis. The 
stagnation of the ingesta leads to an increasing acid intoxication. 
\\'hile he considers that there is no necessity for reducing the 
intake of protein any more than the fat or carbohydrate, he found 
everything indicates that the food should be capable of rapid con- 
version into absorbable material, that it should be small in quan- 
tity, and leave very little residue after digestion. He therefore 
recommended that in all serious cases an exclusive milk diet should 
be tried. Even when the degenerative processes are of a serious 
nature, they are not necessarily progressive, and therefore, by 
excluding further injury, a permanent improvement in the patient's 
condition may be made. But the continued abstinence from alcohol 
is necessary in every case for the encouragement of improvement.

liver also suggests the absolute exclusion of coffee, and tea should 
only be taken in a very weak form. 

It is seldom that fatty liver is a distinct and separate object of 
medical treatment. When the enlargement is due to fatty deposit 
in the hver of persons who are perfectly healthy, our efforts at 
treatment must be guided by our knowledge of the habits and ten- 
dencies of the individual. VV'hen the fatty liver depends on actual 
disease, it is essentially by treating that disease that we may hope 
to remove the hepatic accumulation. 

When it occurs in persons who eat or drink excessively, the 
causal indication demands a thorough change in the mode of life. 
The treatment is practically that of obesity [q.v ) . General advice 
is useless, because it is seldom followed. If the treatment is to be 
successful, the amount and kind of food, drink, and exercise must 
be carefully planned and written down for the guidance of the 
patient. The dietary should be cut down to 1,800 or 2,000 calories. 
There is no need to cut out the fats from the food, so long as there 
is an absence of jaundice; but they should be reduced to 30 or 
40 grammes a day at the most, and this can be done by forbidding 
fatty substances — e.g., fat meat and articles cooked in fat, and very 
much butter. Neither is there any necessity to forbid carbo- 
hydrates entireh', but they should be reduced to 100 or 150 grammes 
a day, forbidding potatoes, sugar, cakes, jam, marmalade, milk 
puddings, and all other sweet articles, and reducing the bread to 
3 or 4 ounces daily The patient may have an abundance of fresh 
vegetables and fruit, which may be selected from the following: 
Cabbage, Brussels sprouts, savoy, kale, cauliflower, turnips, arti- 
chokes, S/achys tiiherifera green salads, lettuce, watercress, endive, 
chicory, dandelion, sorrel; apples, pears, oranges, grapes, tomatoes, 
and bananas (not too freely). Carrots and potatoes are not good for 
people with liver disease, the latter because they are too starchy, 
the former too sweet. It is not known whether carrotin has any 
influence on the hepatic functions, but as it is allied to cholesterin, 
it is better that carrots should not be consumed, owing to the ten- 
dency in hepatic diseases to the formation of gall-stones. The 
patient should not have rich or fatty soups, nor those thickened with 
flour, pea-flour, lentils, or beans. Vegetable soups are as a rule 
good. Boiled meat or fowl are better than an}' other form of meat, 
because boiling extracts a portion of the meat bases and purins. 
Tea and coffee should only be taken in moderation, owing to 
their containing xanthin bases. The patient should be encouraged 
to rise earh- and collect his own salads before breakfast. The 
following dietary is useful: 

Breakfast. — Hggs, one or two ; lean ham, i i to 2 ounces ; stale bread without 
butter; watercress, lettuce, dandelion leaves, endive, or tomatoes. 

Dinner. — Vegetable soup, made with milk; boiled meat, tish, or fowl; 
cabbage, savoy, cauliflower, etc.; i ounce of bread; one or two new potatoes, 
artichokes ; a small piece of cheese; tomatoes, and lettuce. Raw fruit, cooked 
fruit, and custard or junket. 



372 DISEASES OF THE LIVER 

I lit. — A oiipli'.l i i C:,ina tea; i ounce of breiid-and-butter if desired; straw- 
ben les, raspberries, apple, pear, apricot. 

Supper. — Half pint of milk, i ounce of oatmeal (rolled oats, Quaker oats, 
Provost oats, coarse oatmeal) made into gruel; or vegetable soup, | pint; 
I ounce of bread-and-butter; fruit, raw or cooked. 

The indications for treatment arising from the disease are also 
important. They are derived from the fohowing considerations: 
(i) There is less fat in the hepatic than in the portal vein; (2) the 
secretory activity of the hver ceUs diminishes as the fat in them 
rises. Therefore drugs should be given which are known to have 
a cholagogue effect. The free and continued use of mineral waters 
containing sulphates and alkaline carbonates have a good effect 
by increasing the flow of bile and reducing the general accumula- 
tion of fat in the body. The superfluous fat of the body disappears, 
under the influence of the waters at Harrogate, Carlsbad, Marienbad, 
Homburg, Kissingen, etc. After a month's residence at Harrogate 
or one of the Continental spas, taking the water regularly and under 
medical direction, most patients return home much thinner than 
they went there. There is no doubt that the change in the mode of 
hfe, the increased amount of exercise, and moderation of the dietary, 
have much to do with the effects of residence at such places. But 
these alone are not sufficient to clear the liver of superfluous fat and 
rob the body of its weight. In a very large percentage of cases the 
waters are more or less essential. The action of these liquids is 
not quite clear, but the system of a Carlsbad patient has been 
likened to a soap factor}^ in which the sodium of the water and the 
fat of the body are the sources of the soap which forms a part of 
the fseces. Whatever the explanation may be, there is no doubt 
about the effect of such waters in fatty liver, and this course of 
treatment is recommended for all persons who are obese and sus- 
pected to have fatty infiltration of the liver. 

But neither the spa treatment nor the dietary outlined above 
would be correct for a phthisical person, nor any other patient 
suffering from cachexia, and suspected of having fatty infiltration 
or degeneration of the hver. In such cases the food must be nourish- 
ing and stimulating ; the proportion of fattening materials must not 
be reduced in amount. On the other hand, the diet must be 
supplemented by plenty of milk and casein preparations, eggs, 
easily digested meat and fish, and light forms of carbohydrate 
foods, such as milk puddings, custard, junkets, and farinaceous 
materials. The treatment should consist of superalimentation 
instead of diminution in the calorie value of the food. The- liver 
may be stimulated by mild drugs to secrete more bile and assist in 
reheving the organ of its burden. The same method will promote 
the absorption of fat from the alimentary canal, and assist in 
counterbalancing the losses due to emaciation. The alkaline 
sulphates should not be given in these cases, but the organic 
cholagogues may be given in the place of them. 

The treatment of cirrhosis depends partly upon the findings of 
men who have experimented on the metabolism of nitrogen. 



CTRRfinsrs nr tiif. liver ^73 

Harley and Labadic-Legran found that the variations in tho excre- 
tion of urea are dependent more on the general nutrition than on 
the condition of the tissues of the Hver. This conclusion was con- 
firmed bv the observations of Favitski of St. Petersburg/ who 
found that the metabohsm of nitrogen in subjects with cirrhosis of 
the liver approaches that of healthy persons. On a mixed diet the 
assimilation was 84 to 94 per cent., and therefore not quite normal, 
and the quantity of urea varied from 14 to 45 grammes daily — the 
usual quantity being from 25 to 35 grammes. The excretion of uric 
acid was in most cases parallel with the variation in the urea. The 
absolute amount of extractives in the urine was not large, and did 
not vary very much from that in a healthy man. It may be de- 
duced from these observations that the quantity of nitrogenous 
food should not be reduced, and that is partly correct; but the 
nitrogenous food should be light, easily digested, not too abundant, 
and not too stimulating. It is exceedingly important that the 
gastro - intestinal catarrh be taken into consideration, and it is 
perhaps more on this account than because of any change in the 
liver that we need to study the kind and quantity of the nitrogenous 
food. Milk is undoubtedly one of the best sources of protein in such 
cases, and there arc times during the course of the disease when an 
entirely milk diet for a week or two is essential — milk, peptonized 
milk, junket, milk jelly, milk soup, or milk and invalid foods. 
These periods are determined by the general condition of the 
patient and by the variations in the catarrh of the gastro-intestinal 
mucosa, a subacute condition necessitating a temporary milk diet. 
But in the'ordinary course of events it is unnecessary to keep the 
patient on milk diet. Eggs, especially in the form of custard, 
are almost equally well digested, and they maybe consumed lightly 
boiled or poached. Mutton, tender beef, chicken, pheasant, tongue, 
tripe, and all the lighter kinds of fish can also be taken in small 
quantities and at suitable intervals. The consumption of these 
proteins should be watched, because of the progressive emaciation. 
An allowance of 34 grammes of protein daily is the minimum necessary 
to maintain the nitrogen balance in equilibrium, providing enough 
energy-producing food is consumed and assimilated. But I have 
shown elsewhere that it is advisable that the amount of protein 
should not sink below 60 grammes daily for an adult; and even with 
this quantitv the body must continue to waste unless the calorie 
value of the food assimilated is equivalent to the expenditure, and 
the expenditure is never less than 1,600 calories, unless the patient 
is absolutely at rest in bed. If the gastro-intestinal catarrh is really 
bad, it must necessarilv interfere with the digestion and assimi- 
lation of all foods, and it may then be advisable to assist nature 
by the administration of pepsin or pancreatin. But it should not 
be imagined that these enzymes will improve the power of absorp- 
tion, because this function is limited by reason of the catarrh and

374 DISEASES OF THE LIVER 

portal congestion, and it is probablymore defective than the digestive 
function. Schwarz^ found no reason in the Hver for diminishing 
either the nitrogenous, amylaceous, or fatt}' foods (unless there be 
jaundice and a lack of bile in the bowels). But the digestive tract 
is so involved in the catarrhal process, due primarily to the dele- 
terious ingesta which cause the hepatic disease — e.g., alcohol — and 
secondly, to the circulation being disturbed bv portal congestion, 
that absorption is considerabl}- delayed. In fact, Schwarz saj^s the 
surface available for absorption is reduced to as much as one-half 
by catarrh and atrophy of the mucous membrane, owing to peri- 
phlebitis of the portal system, chronic peritonitis, stagnation of 
the ingesta, fermentation, and auto-intoxication. Ever3'thing in- 
dicates that the food should be in such form that it is capable of 
speed}' conversion and absorption. The food, therefore, should be 
highly nutritious, small in bulk, unirritating, and leave very little 
residue in the alimentary canal. For these reasons Schwarz recom- 
mends, whenever the case assumes a serious aspect, a trial at all 
events should be made of a rigid milk diet. He says even the 
degenerative processes are not necessarilv progressive, and by ex- 
cluding further injury, a permanent benefit may be obtained. 

It is said by other authorities that starch and fat should be 
avoided b}- such patients. But it is only necessary to exclude 
starchy foods when the digestive power is very feeble; and even 
then the digestion can be assisted b\- the use of diastase, malt extract, 
taka-diastase, etc. Thus, we may give dextrinized or pancreatized 
starch in the form of the various prepared foods sold for invalids 
and infants. There is no deficiency of such foods, and the variety 
on the market is great enough to satisfy the caprices of any invalid. 
But we cannot increase the absorptive power of the mucous mem- 
brane by giving predigested cereals and starches. The lack of 
absorption, we have said, is due to the intestinal catarrh. We 
cannot remove this obsti-uction, and therefore the assimilation of 
carbohydrates and proteins must fail sooner or later. So long as 
the patient can take carbohydrates and absorb them, they must 
be given to him. When he is unable to absorb them, they will 
undergo bacterial fermentation in the ahmentary canal, and give 
rise to flatulent distension, which will increase his discomfort. 

The supply of fat has still to be considered. There is no need 
to reduce the consumption of fat so long as it is saponified and 
absorbed. It will be saponified and absorbed while there is an 
adequate secretion of bile and pancreatic fluid. In ordinary 
atrophic cirrhosis the small biliary ducts are not necessarily impli- 
cated, bile is not usuall}' retained, and there is little or no jaundice. 
In the later stages of atrophic cirrhosis, however, the mucous mem- 
brane of the bile-ducts becomes thickened, and the channels are 
narrowed in consequence of catarrh, and then the flow of bile is 
more or less hindered. In the hypertrophic form jaundice is far 
more common, due to the disease affecting the small bile-ducts, 

^ Centralbl. f. d. Ges.-Therapie, August, 1899. 



CIRRHOSIS or Tin: liver 373 

which become blocked by accumulated secretions. It should, 
however, be observed that Mayo Robson and others consider the 
presence of bile in the intestinal canal is by no means essential 
to the absorption of fat, and that only about half of tlie absorbed fat 
goes through the liver, and the balance through the lymphatics to 
the systemic circulation. The usual quantity of fat may therefore 
be allowed the patient, only prescribing it in forms which are most 
easily absorbed. Milk, cream, butter, Devonshire cream, cream 
cheese, cod-liver oil, and fish-liver are better sources of fat than fat 
meat and fat hsh. It is, moreover, advisable that the patient 
should avoid foods cooked in fat, " rich " foods, cakes, pastry, 
crumpets, muffins, hot buttered toast, and all articles in which lard, 
oil, margarine, and similar fats are used; and the main reasons for 
advising their rejection is because they are less readily absorbed 
and have an unfavourable influence on the gastro-intestinal catarrh. 
The dietary for chronic intestinal catarrh may advantageously be 
studied in this connection. 

In the h3'pertrophic form of cirrhosis it is even more essential to 
exercise care in the selection of fats, because, according to very 
many authorities, the deficiency of bile does influence the absorp- 
tion of fat. This is a point which is not settled definitely, but it 
is customary in all cases of jaundice, no matter what is its cause, 
to recommend that the supply of fat should be cut down as much 
as possible owing to the deficiency of bile. It is an observed fact 
that healthy persons having a biliary fistula, and therefore a de- 
ficiency of bile in the intestines, absorb fat nearly as well as those 
who have no biliary fistula. But the conditions are different in un- 
healthy people, and especially when gastro-intestinal catarrh prevails. 

Vegetables and fruit may be allowed in both varieties of the dis- 
ease to some extent; but, again, the kind and quantity must be 
governed by the gastro-intestinal catarrh. We may usually allow 
spinach, cauliflower, French or string beans, vegetable marrow, 
boiled lettuce and boiled beet-leaves, tomatoes, rhubarb, cooked 
apples, stewed pears, cooked figs, and prunes. A few raw straw- 
berries, raspberries, currants, or an orange, may also be allowed. 
Potatoes and carrots are disallowed by many authorities; but puree 
of vegetables, consomme, milk soup, tomato soup, and mutton or 
chicken broth in which vegetables have been cooked, are usually 
permissible, providing they do not contain too much fat. The fat 
can be removed from broth by allowing it to become cold, when it 
may be taken away en masse. 

If diarrhoea becomes a marked feature of the disease, the patient 
should have the dietary given under that heading. If luematemesis 
and melaena affect the patient, the food must consist of liquids for 
the time being, and especially of lime-water and milk, casein prep- 
arations, arrowroot or cornflour and milk, isinglass and milk. When 
ascites occurs, the amount of salt should be reduced, and perhaps 
a salt-free diet prescribed for a few weeks. A diet consisting 
largel}' of milk or milk and eggs is useful at this stage, and often 



376 DISEASES OF THE LIVER 

results in the removal of a large quantity of fluid from the swollen 
abdomen. This effect is aided by the diuretic effect of the lactose, 
and the limitation of chlorides. The dilution of milk is sometimes 
necessary, especially when patients find it hard to digest or ex- 
perience a sense of fulness and weight after it. Buttermilk, whey, 
barley-water, oatmeal-water, Vichy, Vals, Ems, Perrier, Apollinaris, 
and other alkaline waters may be used for this purpose, but the 
consumption of diuretic waters and beverages alone seems absolutely 
useless against the ascites. 

The beverages permissible to a cirrhotic patient must necessarily 
be of a non-alcohohc type. It may be asked: " What is fhe use 
of cutting off the alcohol when the patient is already doomed ?" 
Alcohol is forbidden because it tends to increase the gastro-intestinal 
catarrh as well as the liver disease. By making alcohol taboo the 
life of the patient will probably be longer than if he continues to 
use it. If the disease is recognized, or even suspected, in its early 
stages, its progress may be arrested by strictly avoiding alcohol. 
Horsley^ says: " If alcohol is removed, the condition of the liver 
will go back to what it was before the irritation occurred; the new 
cells will disappear. But if the irritant be applied again and again, 
these cells ■will settle down and develop into a permanent fibrous 
tissue, forming what is knou-n as ' scar tissue,' and a pecuharity of 
scar tissue is that it cannot be removed." Tea and coffee should 
only be allowed in moderation. The patient may have a moderate 
allowance of hquids, up to 2 or 3 pints a day, but it should consist 
chiefly of the aerated alkahne waters. The alkahne carbonates are 
useful by decreasing the toughness of the secretion from the gastro- 
intestinal mucosa; they help to remove the mucus, to cleanse the 
surface of the membrane, and to that extent materially aid the 
process oi absorption and assimilation. The alkaline sulphates 
also assist by relieving the portal congestion. It is unnecessary 
for the patient to go to Carlsbad, Marienbad, Tarasp, or other Conti- 
nental spas if he is unable to do so ; the waters can be obtained locally, 
or an imitation can be made by the use of the salts which they con- 
tain. Such waters will assist the stomach and bowels to some extent ; 
but when the atrophic stage of the disease is begun, we can no longer 
hope to arrest its progress. All we can do is to check the increasing 
emaciation and growang debility of the patient. These aims are best 
carried out by careful attention to the dietary, by keeping the body 
warmly clad, by exercising it in the open air, and keeping regular 
and early hours. 

Cancer of the Liver. 

Cancer of the liver may be primary or secondary. The symp- 
toms are always obscure in the early stage, and in some cases never 
become sufficiently distinctive to enable a diagnosis to be made 
before death. The general symptoms are those of cancer in other 
parts of the body, emaciation, and cachexia. If the tumour com-

CANCER OF THE LIVER 377 

presses large trunks of the portal vein, there may be a moderate 
degree of ascites; if it implicates the portal vein itself, the ascites 
will be considerable. The obstruction of the portal circulation 
gives rise to gastro-duodenal catarrh. Compression of the large 
bile-ducts causes a partial obstruction to the flow of bile, and jaundice 
results from it. even though there may be a sufficient flow of bile 
into the bowels to give colour to the faces. If the ductus chole- 
dochus is compressed, the obstruction of bile is general, the jaundice 
very pronounced, and the faeces colourless. It is said that there is 
no jaundice in half the cases. The above symptoms are not diag- 
nostic of cancer of the liver, and, in the absence of a tumour, would 
not be indicative of cancer. 

The treatment of cancer of the liver is very unsatisfactory. We 
have to satisfy ourselves by nourishing the patient and maintaining 
the strength as long as we can. Nitrogenous and amylaceous foods 
may be given in normal quantities, their digestion and assimilation 
being dependent chiefly on the degree of gastro-intestinal catarrh; 
but if there is pronounced jaundice, it seems useless to give very 
much fat. Nevertheless, a milk diet is often the only useful diet. 
The jaundice and gastro-intestinal catarrh are our chief guides in 
framing a diet list; but the emaciation and increasing debihty 
demand a nutritious food, and sufficiently abundant to prevent the 
loss of flesh and strength. It is ad\dsable not to overlook the 
deficiency of hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice of all cancer 
cases, and that the administration of this acid may assist the 
digestion and assimilation of food. 

The dietary should consist of milk, junket, eggs, meat powders 
(meatox, sornatose, etc.), dried milk (Trumilk, Cow and Gate), 
casein preparations (Plasmon, Sanatogen, tilia, protene, lacumen, 
lacvitum), vegetable proteins (aleuronat, glidine, roborat, etc.). 
Ordinary meat, fish, or fowl, may be taken in proportion to the 
appetite and powder of digestion (see Gastric and Intestinal Catarrh). 
The carbohydrates may consist of bread, toast, roll, milk puddings, 
potatoes, sugar, honey, treacle, malt extract. An excess of sugar 
might increase the gastro-intestinal catarrh It may therefore 
be necessary to reduce the consumption of all kinds of sweets, and 
rely upon dextrinized carbohydrates, such as invahd foods, and to 
use more milk, pulped meat, pounded chicken or fish, and various 
meat pastes to increase the consumption of protein. If fat appears 
to be digested very well, cream, cream cheese, clotted cream, and 
butter may be taken freely ; but according to most authorities fats 
are not absorbed verv readily. The secretion of gastric juice is 
stimulated by soup and extract of meat, and therefore the adminis- 
tration of these foods may promote the digestion of proteins. By 
the same rule the use of potatoes may promote the digestion of 
carbohydrates through the influence of their asparagin, which is 
a stimulant of enzyme action. Spinach, cauliflower, boiled lettuce, 
or celery, spring cabbage; stewed fruit, and junket or custard may 
all be allowed if they cause no pain or discomfort. 



378 DISHASES OF THE LIVER 



Jaundice. 



Jaundice is only a symptom. It is usually indicative of some 
obstruction to the passage of bile from its place of origin in the 
liver to the duodenum. It is not necessary for obstruction to be 
very great to cause jaundice. The bile-ducts contain involuntary 
muscular fibres which normally assist the flow of bile maintained 
by the vis a tergo originating in the secretor}^ pressure. But these 
fibres are subject to atony the same as other muscular fibres, and 
such atony appears to be easily induced by hyperaemia and other 
causes affecting the mucous membrane. It is true that the Hver 
is subjected to the pressure of the diaphragm during inspiration. 
But the influence of such pressure on the flow of bile must be very 
small in man\' cases, and especially in women. A slight obstruction 
in the biliar}' passages will induce a retention of the bile, and if 
the secretor}' activity of the liver cells is normal, the bile-ducts and 
hepatic cells become overloaded, the pressure in the lymphatic 
and bloodvessels is slightly reversed, whence some of the bile enters 
these vessels and is carried by the circulating fluids all over the body, 
and gives rise to jaundice and various symptoms due to the circula- 
tion of bile-salts in the blood, such as bile in the urine, bradycardia, 
and various evidences of toxaemia. 

Compression of the bile-ducts may arise from diseases of the liver, 
such as tumours, carcinoma, hydatids, cirrhosis, and chronic 
hyperaemia. Compression may arise from the outside — e.g., cancer 
of the head of the pancreas, enlargement of the right kidney, etc. 
The most common obstructive causes of jaundice are within the 
bile-ducts — e.g., hydatids, impacted gall-stones, and catarrh of the 
bile-ducts. The consequences of jaundice are various. The first 
is a progressive and rapid emaciation of the body, and has special 
reference to the absorption of the food. This emaciation goes on 
in spite of the fact that the appetite may be, and often is, normal. 
The digestion and absorption of protein and carbohydrate is not 
much interfered with, providing there is no gastro-intestinal catarrh ; 
but the absorption of fat is reduced to 50 or 60 per cent, of the normal 
proportion,^ and the absorption of the other elements of the food is 
depreciated in proportion to the catarrh. Miiller^ found by ob- 
servations on men who suffered from jaundice that the digestion 
and assimilation of protein was not quite normal, " but was very 
little changed." Vilizhanin^ made observations on dogs (i) in the 
normal condition, (2) with bihary fistula, (3) with jaundice. He 
found that the passage of bile into the blood caused an intensified 
cleavage of protein in the organism, as a result of which there is an 
increased excretion of nitrogen in the urine. But some animals 
with biliary fistula remained well nourished, while others emaciated

J A UNDICF. 379 

rapidly. The defective absorption of fat and increased cleavage 
of protein are a sufficient explanation of the emaciation usually 
observed in jaundice. 

The other consequences of obstructive jaundice are believed to 
be a result of poisoning by bile-acids. The patient becomes languid 
and sleepy, has a slow pulse, an itchy skin, and other evidences of 
toxcemia, which are more or less marked according to the severity 
and duration of the jaundice. The bradycardia is one of these 
effects; a pulse of 40 or 50 a minute is quite common, and 20 beats 
per minute have been observed. It is significant that Bouchard 
found bile to be nine times more toxic than urine. 

The dietary for catarrhal jaundice should be similar to that 
detailed under chronic gastric or chronic intestinal catarrh, pre- 
ceded by a milk diet for two or three days; and in all forms of 
obstructive jaundice the food must be such as will help to raise the 
patient from the depressed condition which usually obtains. It 
should consist of various kinds of protein and carbohydrate foods 
in a light and easily digestible form. It is practically impossible 
to abohsh fat from the diet, because it is inseparable from most 
nitrogenous and amylaceous foods. At the same time it is advisable 
to reduce the consumption of fat, the deficiency in the calorie value 
of the food being made up with extra protein and carbohydrate; 
and it is better to eat cold meat than hot. The food, therefore, 
should consist of tender lean beef, mutton, lamb, poultry, and 
game; hght kinds of fish, such as sole, plaice, whiting, fresh haddock, 
bass, brill, cod, and turbot. Soups are permissible, especially those 
made of vegetables and milk, mutton broth, veal broth and bone 
soup, care being taken that as much fat as possible is removed. 
It may be argued that the presence of fat does not matter, because 
it will pass out with the faeces; but it is well known that an excess 
of fat in the food prevents the digestion and absorption of other 
foods; therefore, when fat cannot be digested, it is better avoided. 
All kinds of vegetables are allowable, especially those ^yhich con- 
tain cellulose and tend to provoke intestinal activity— if they do 
not at the same time aggravate the coexisting intestinal catarrh, 
which requires watching. Potato, spinach, cauliflower, French beans, 
green peas, asparagus, boiled onions, and vegetable marrow may be 
allowed to all patients; but if the gastro-intestinal catarrh is very 
marked, cabbage, savoy, Brussels sprouts, turnips, swedes {Ruta 
6flga), carrots, artichokes, sweet potatoes, andyams will be detrimental 
unless they are reduced to a puree by rubbing them through a sieve. 
Amylaceous foods consisting of white or brown bread, biscuit 
(crackers), and plain cakes — e.g., sponge or Madeira cake — are 
allowable; also light milk puddings— rice, sago, tapioca, ground 
rice, custard, and junket, with stewed fruit. Fresh raw fruit is 
good, especiallv the soft varieties; and practically any kind of fruit 
is permissible when the intestinal catarrh is not very bad. 

The beverage may consist of weak tea or coffee — no cream and 
very little sugar; abundance of plain water, aerated alkaline waters, 



38o DTSEASES OF THE LIVER 

especially soda or potash water, Apollinaris and Perrier. The 
patient may also drink ordinary solutions of bicarbonate of soda, 
acetate of potash, or cream of tartar in lemon-water. The diuretic 
action of these salts will assist in removing a quantity of bile pig- 
ment, and, when the urine is scanty, are urgently needed. Under 
exceptional circumstances a little good whisky or brandy, or even 
a little superior Burgundy or claret, may be permitted. 

The foods to be avoided are strong soup, rich gravy, sweetbread, 
brain, fat meat, all kinds of fat fish — e.g., salmon, trout, eel, herring, 
mackerel; hot meat, twice-cooked meat, curry, pork, veal, ham, 
bacon, eggs, butter, cream, cream cheese, cheese, dried fruits, and 
nuts; rich cakes, pastry, sweets; alcohol: beer, porter, sweet wines, 
and especially champagne. 

The constipation which exists suggests the use of laxatives; but 
the causal indication must be taken into account. If the jaundice 
gives rise to symptoms of severe toxaemia with excitement or 
delirium, the application of ice or cold water to the head, and strong 
purgatives internally may be of use. Swallowing small pieces of 
ice may check the vomiting, and this treatment may be aided by 
foods, such as Valentine's meat juice or albumin-water (white of 
e^g and lemon-water) ; and in the comatose condition the patient 
may be fed -per rectum or by means of an oesophageal tube, care 
being taken, of course, that the tube is in the oesophagus and not 
in the trachea. In other cases, also, it may be necessary to confine 
the patient to a diet of a fluid or semifluid character — e.g., milk 
fortified by casein preparations, somatose, glidine; powdered meat, 
fowl, or fish, given in soup or milk; raw eggs; and farinaceous 
foods, such as MeUin's, Benger's, Allenbury's, Savory and Moore's, 
may in turn all be very useful; and in the latest stages we may 
have to be satisfied if we can get the patient to take small quantities 
of Valentine's beef-juice, Mosquera's beef-jelly. Brand's essence of

varieties of the stones are as follows: (i) Pure cholesterin stones 

(2) Laminated cholesterin stones consisting of 90 per cent, of 
cholesterin with some bilirubin-calcium and calcium-carbonate. 

(3) Common gall-bladder stones, consisting of a mixture of choles- 
terin, bilirubin-calcium, calcium carbonate, albuminous and 
mucinoid material. The latter form the greater proportion of gall- 
stones. When removed from the gall-bladder, they are often so 
soft that they can be crushed into a greas}^ crumbling pulp, almost 
like a piece of clay. They consist of a central nucleus, and often

Society, 1896). 



GALL-STONES 381 

contain a cavity iilled with a yellowish alkaline fluid. Their form 
and size varies, and they are frequently faceted. (4) Mixed bili- 
rubin-calcium stones containing 25 per cent, or more or cholesterin, 
the remainder being bilirubin-calcium with small quantities of copper 
and iron. (5) Pure bihrubin-calcium stones, containing only traces 
of cholesterin. (6) Rarer forms: [a) Cholesterin gravel of the size 
of a grain of sand to a pea. With the exception of a foreign nucleus, 
they consist of pure cholesterin. [b) Calcareous stones, consisting 
largely of calcium carbonate with a little cholesterin and bilirubin, 
(c) Conglomerate stones, {d) Casts of the bile-ducts, consisting of 
pure bilirubin-calcium. 

The origin of the constituents of gall-stones is disputed. As 
regards cholesterin, Naunyn says: " The cholesterin in the bile is 
2 "5 per cent., and pretty constant; it is independent of the propor- 
tion in the blood and the kind of food; nutritive derangements have 
no influence on the amount in the bile." The bile is an active 
poison to protoplasm, and some of the epithelial cells of the mucous 
membrane of the bile passages continually succumb to its action; 
it is very probable that an active shedding of these cells goes on in 
normal circumstances, and the debris mingles with the bile. The 
gall-bladder epithelium contains myelin globules which are essen- 
tially cholesteryl oleate; these, according to Adami, normally pass 
into the bile. In certain conditions of the gall-bladder this 
cholesterin is liberated in a solid state (Naunyn's amorphous 
cholesterin), and tends to collect in clumps; and in other conditions 
the precipitation of crystalline cholesterin occurs. 

The view promulgated by Bramson that the precipitation of lime 
is due to an excess of this substance in the diet is not supported 
b}^ experiments on animals. But cholesterin and lime-salts normal 
to the bile are held in solution by taurocholate and glycocholate of 
soda; and it is probable that precipitation of both substances may 
arise from a deflciency of these salts. 

Gall-stones may form around nuclei, but the introduction of 
foreign bodies into the gall-bladder shows it is improbable that this 
is the common origin. Naunyn believed them to be formed as an 
aggregation of masses of amorphous cholesterin, etc. The surface 
of such a mass becomes clothed with a layer of bilirubin-calcium 
as thick and hard as a sparrow's egg-shell, and then the cholesterin 
begins to crystallize. It grows by disintegration of epithelial cells. 
The ultimate cause, most commonly, is catarrh of the mucous 
membrane of the bile passages set up by bacteria or some change 
in the chemical composition of the bile. The formation of gall- 
stones is favoured by age, sex, fashion of dress, luxurious living, 
gout, obesity, and alcohol. 

Treatment consists of reduction of the catarrhal inflammation of 
the bile-ducts, and stimulation of the functions of the liver. Sur- 
gical treatment is necessary to remove stones in many cases, and 
will assist in the cure of cholelithiasis. Mayo Robson recommends 
surgical treatment — (i) In repeated attacks of biliary colic which 



382 DISEASES OF THE LIVER 

do not yield to medicinal treatment; (2) where there is evidence of 
cholangitis or suppuration; (3) empyema of the gall-bladder; 
(4) drops}- of the gall-bladder; (5) obstructive jaundice, if there is 
reason to think the common duct is occluded by gall-stones ; (6) in 
acute peritonitis or perforating peritonitis starting in the region of 
the gall-bladder, where the previous liistory of the patient is sugges- 
tive of gall-stones. 

Although the removal of a stone does not cure cholelithiasis, 
such an operation removes the obstruction to the course of the bile 
and one of the local causes of irritation, while rest in bed and careful 
dietary subsequent to the operation may go far towards curing the 
catarrh of the bile channels and gall-bladder. But the disordered 
functions of the liver, and in many cases the catarrh of the bile 
passages and the duodenum, can only be cured by a long course of 
dietetic and hygienic measures. 

It is unnecessary to restrict the patient to any particular class 
of food; more depends on temperance in eating and drinking than 
on the kind of materials. But a few points have to be rigidly enforced. 
The food should be plain but plentiful. Excesses of all kinds favour 
the catarrh of the bile-ducts. If the dietary of the patient before 
treatment has been such as would favour the development of gastro- 
duodenal catarrh, it must be modified as in the treatment of that 
catarrh A similar dietary to that for catarrh of the stomach or 
bowels is, on the whole, the best for gall-stones. The consumption 
of plenty of animal food is essential to provoke a secretion of bile, 
and prevent or assist in preventing biliary stasis. If the diet be 
restricted in amount, the secretion of bile will be diminished, and 
it may remain in the gall-bladder instead of passing into the duo- 
denum. Stagnant bile tends to become inspissated by the absorp- 
tion of water, and it may undergo changes in composition whereby 
it is disabled from retaining cholesterin and bile-salts in solution. 
Frequent and hearty meals, therefore, are recommended by most 
physicians to encourage the flow of bile: a good supper is said to 
be one of the most certain preventatives of gall-stones, providing 
the repast is of the right kind and quality. Although meat is 
recommended as favouring a good flow of bile, and preventing stag- 
nation, it is essential that the meat shall be of such a character that 
it will not cause indigestion. Therefore pork, veal, sausages, hashed 
meat, pork pie, duck, goose, high game, herrings, mackerel, salmon, 
lobster, crab, mussels, etc., must be strictly avoided. It is equally 
essential that the formation of alimentary toxins be avoided as 
much as possible, in order to free the liver from an excess of work 
in destroying them. 

Fat of aU kinds is usually forbidden, although vegetable fats are 
considered not so injurious as animal fats. The patient should not 
eat the fat of meat, bacon, or ham; little or no butter should be 
taken; eggs should be limited to one a day; brain and liver would 
naturally be forbidden because they contain both fat and choles- 
terin; fatty dishes such as eel, mackerel, herrings, sprats, etc., must 
also be avoided; and all other fatty foods, substances cooked in fat, 



GALL-STONES 383 

rich cakes and puddings, suet dumplings, and puddings with boiled 
pastry crust. Fats are forbidden on the ground that they upset the 
alimentary organs; when taken in excess, they exercise no favour- 
able action on the secretion of bile; on the other hand, they are often 
said to overtax the liver cells, and they are generally badly toler- 
ated. The opinions of Halliburton and Michael Foster are given 
in the section on Jaundice. Burney Yeo ^ says the excretion of an 
excessive amount of cholesterin appears to be dependent to some 
extent on an excessive consumption of fats, and gives that as a 
reason for cutting down the supply. On the other hand, Binet ^ 
says that there is no need to cut down the supply of fat excepting 
in jaundice, or where there is a very insufficient supply of bile, the 
greater part of the consumed fat being absorbed by the chyle 
vessels [lacteals), and does not traverse the liver. He therefore 
considers it is legitimate to allow a certain quantity of fat in the 
food of most patients. But he makes a distinction between his 
cases, and absolutely forbids fat when there is no doubt that the 
liver is overtaxed and its cellular functions manifestly insufftcient. 
The toleration of fat varies in different cases and according to the 
variety consumed. Only fats of low fusion-point should be allowed, 
such as butter and cream, and these must be free from taint or 
rancidity. In many cases there are positive reasons for recom- 
mending fat as a part of the diet. If two similar cases are treated, 
one with and the other without fat, it may be noticed that the 
patient to whom fat is allowed improves more rapidly, and the 
improvement is better maintained, than the other from whom fat 
is withheld. The reason for this, according to Binet, is because 
there is frequently a coexistent hyperchlorhydria and pain due to 
pyloric spasm. These are the cases in which fat does most good. 
The laxative effects of fat ought also to be of value in these cases. 
Olive-oil is often prescribed; it is digested better than fat meat, but 
is not borne so well as cream or butter. Olive-oil is frequently 
prescribed on the supposition that it will dissolve the gall-stones, 
or soften them, so that they will easily pass through the bile-ducts. 
It may be given in doses of one or two tablespoonfuls in hot milk 
at bedtime. It has been prescribed in large and smaller doses, but 
the reports on its effects are by no means uniform or satisfactory. 
Possibly this may be due to its administration in the wrong class 
of cases. Binet says the administration of fats should not be per- 
mitted except in the chronic stage, and when every trace of local 
or general infection after an acute inflammatory attack has passed 
off. In suitable cases he prescribes 60 to 100 grammes of butter 
or 200 to 300 grammes of cream in twenty-four hours, one-third of 
the amount to be taken three times a day at the end of the meal. 
The evening dose, he considers, secures a better flow of bile during 
the following night. 

The carbohydrates may as a rule be taken in moderation There 
is usually no reason why bread and potatoes should be limited; 

^ " Food in Health and Disease," p. 433. 
* Tribune Midicale, 1910, x. 



384 DISEASES OE THE LIVER 

but it must be distinctly understood that a diet consisting of bread- 
and-butter and tea, or potatoes and a bit of bacon, or tiny pieces of 
meat, would be a most erroneous diet, and would favour duodenal 
and biliary catarrh. Sugar— that is, ordinary cane-sugar — should 
be eaten sparingly owdng to its tendency to fermentation and to 
cause catarrh of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane. All sweet 
dishes, therefore, should be taken in moderation, as well as jam, 
marmalade, and treacle. But golden syrup and substances contain- 
ing maltose, dextrose, and dextrin, are equally nourishing, and are 
believed to be less injurious. 

The patient must avoid pickles, spices, condiments, highly 
seasoned foods, and other articles which have been previously 
condemned as capable of causing hepatic hypersemia and gastro- 
intestinal disorders. 

Vegetables and fruits which are not very sweet may be allowed. 
Potatoes, cauliflower, cabbage, spinach, vegetable marrow, string 
or snap beans, lettuce, watercress, tomatoes, dandehon, endive, 
seakale, asparagus, artichokes, and other vegetables are useful. 
But turnips and swedes should only be taken in the form of puree, 
while peas, beans, lentils, and carrots should be forbidden because 
they contain phytosterin, which is a vegetable form of cholesterin. 
Jankau found that cholesterin in the food does not increase the 
excretion of cholesterin; nevertheless, it is better to leave it out. 
If stewed fruit is eaten, it should be sweetened with saccharin or 
dulcin ; indigestible fruit and nuts must be avoided, especially nuts 
which contain much fat. But all easily digested vegetables and 
acid fruits are useful, because the organic acids are changed in 
the organism into alkaline carbonates, and promote a flow of thin 
bile. The precipitation of cholesterin is favoured by a deficiency 
in the alkalinity of the bile as shown by Thenard, who considered 
such a condition of the bile had been traced to the too exclusive 
use of animal food. This probably is the basis for the suggestion 
made by some physicians that the consumption of animal foods 
should be restricted. On the other hand, it is known that the secre- 
tion of bile is promoted by abundant animal food, and diminished 
by a diet consisting of fat and farinaceous foods. Therefore it may 
be concluded that good food, in which animal substances figure 
prominently, is the proper treatment for gall-stones, providing too 
much fat is not eaten; but a diet consisting chiefly of bread-and- 
butter and vegetables is bad treatment for gall-stones. 

The patient should drink plenty of liquids with the food and 
between the meals. Most people of this class drink too little fluid, 
which tends to inspissation of bile and stagnation in the bile 
channels; the formation of gall-stones is thus favoured, just as other 
passages which are never flushed tend to become choked up by 
deposits of solid matter. The patient, therefore, must be en- 
couraged to take plenty of liquids. They may consist of tea, 
coffee, cocoa made from the nibs, buttermilk, whey, plain water, 
the alkahne waters (soda-water, Apollinaris, Terrier, Selters, Vichy), 
and plain or aerated distilled water {e.g., Salutaris). A tumblerful oi 



GALL-STONES 385 

hot water with Carlsbad salts or phosphate of soda should be drunk 
each morning while dressing. Hock, Moselle, or light Rhine 
wine, or even good Burgundy, diluted with the foregoing waters, 
is permissible with lunch or dinner. The amount of liquids con- 
sumed during the day should be not less than three pints, and may 
advantageously be increased to 4 pints. Sweet wines, and especially 
champagne, should be forbidden. 
The diet, therefore, may be selected from the following articles: 

Lean Meat. — Beef steak, undercut of beef, sirloin of beef, shoulder or leg 
of mutton, tongue, lean ham. 

Fish.- — All kinds which contain not more than 2 per cent, of fat (see list, 
1>P- 12-13). 

Poultry. — Boiled fowl, chicken, capcm ; pheasant, partridge, and other game, 
unless it is very high. 

Soup. — Clear soup (free from fat), vegetable soup, milk soup, bone soup 
(free from fat and thickening). 

Jelly. — Plain and unsweetened savoury jelly, and other jellies which are 
sweetened with saccharin. 

Eggs.- — One whole egg daily. Th restriction on eggs applies to the yolk 
only, as the white is free from chulesterin and fat. 

Fat. — Butter up to i ounce daily in ordinary' cases, more being allowed if 
there is hyperchlorhydria. Milk and cream are allowed in small quantities. 
The amount of cream usually taken in tea or coffee is permissible; but an 
excess of cream in trifles, " creams," or cream with fruit would be injurious. 
The total amount of " whole " milk consumed should not exceed J pint daily, 
providing enough nitrogenous food can be taken in other forms. Skim milk 
is less injurious than whole milk because of its freedom from fat. 

Farinaceous Foods. — Bread, wholemeal bread, dry toast, rusks, zwiebach, 
biscuits (crackers), oatmeal, barley, rye-meal, buckwheat, arrowroot, sago, 
rice, tapioca, semolina, macaroni, vermicelli, noodles, spaghetti. 

Vegetables and Fruit. — As stated above. 

The remaining points include various hygienic measures Per- 
haps the most important is regular attention to the bowels. 
Aperients are necessary, and they should be such as will increase 
the secretion of bile and dilute it, promote a regular discharge of 
faeces, keep the mucous membrane clean, assist in curing catarrh 
of the alimentary canal, and at the same time relieve portal con- 
gestion. These points are best gained by taking, before breakfast, 
such waters as contain sodium sulphate and bicarbonate — e.g., 
Carlsbad and Marienbad waters. The quantity usually prescribed 
is half a tumblerful of the water with an equal amount of plain 
hot water. It is usually stated that the bottled waters have the 
same beneficial effect as those taken fresh from the spring. This 
is rendered doubtful by the recent knowledge of the action of 
ions of mineral salts and their radio-activity. At an}' rate, it has 
been demonstrated that waters lose a considerable proportion of 
their radio-activity when bottled for any length of time. But in 
the inability of the patient to go to the spa, even the bottled water 
is better than nothing. It stimulates the peristaltic activity of 
the alimentary canal, and refiexly that of the biliary passages, 
and promotes the circulation throughout the portal system. By 
clearing the alimentary canal of bile salts, which are normally re- 



386 DISEASES OF THE LIVER 

absorbed and utilized again, the liver is stimulated to produce more 
bile for the digestive operations. The injection of a large quantity 
of plain hot water into the rectum has a similar effect in clearing 
the bowels, is preferred by many people, and, in the absence of the 
proper water, may be recommended. It is, however, considered 
that the salts in the spa waters do more than clear the bowels of 
effete material. It is believed that the natural aperient waters act 
by stimulating the muscular coats of the gall-bladder and bile-ducts, 
and thereb}^ assist in the evacuation of gall-stones. It is often 
recommended that patients be sent to Carlsbad, Marienbad, Kis- 
singen. Brides, Vichy, and other Continental resorts for treatment, 
where, of course, the treatment is partly dietetic; and it cannot 
be denied that the treatment is valuable. But patients should be 
warned that calculi, even some of large size, are sometimes elimi- 
nated during the treatment, and consequently severe attacks of 
biliary colic and jaundice may occur. It is questionable whether 
better results are obtained at these resorts than could be obtained 
at home if people would submit to the same rigorous treatment. 
There is, however, quite a difficulty in persuading some people to 
follow out a course of treatment at home which they will cheerfully 
travel a thousand miles to follow out in a fashionable resort. 

The sulphurous waters have a ver}^ beneficial effect on the liver, 
and many people find great relief from a course of treatment at 
Harrogate and other places in Great Britain, where the treatment 
is carried out on the same fines as at the Continental spas. 

It is important that the exercise of such patients should be 
regnlated. Walking exercise is probably the best mode for the 
average gcdl-stone patient. It encourages respiration, stimulates 
the circulation, promotes the secretion of bile, assists digestion and 
the action of the bowels. Gall-stones are promoted by stagnation 
of the bile. The object of exercise is to prevent that stagnation. 
Persons who are most subject to gall-stones are often languid, easily 
fatigued, and take practically no exercise Such people must be 
encouraged to exercise themselves in a rational mannar. It is 
possible that they will do this more zealously if they are told to 
practice various exercises. Deep-breathing exercises are useful 
by promoting a flow of bile; they should be practised in such a 
manner that the liver gets a good squeeze between the diaphragm 
and the abdominal muscles. Exercises with a pair of fight dumb- 
bells promote deeper respirations and encourage the circulation. 
Tennis, badminton, golf, and riding on horseback are useful. Many 
patients have got past taking these exercises, or are otherwise 
unable to indulge in them. But all persons can do walking and 
breathing exercises if they wifi do so; and the benefit to be derived 
from them should be fully impressed upon the patient. Gall-stone 
patients must not wear tight corsets or belts, because they impede 
respiration and favour stagnation of the bile; on the other hand, 
it is essential for them to wear warm clothing around the thorax 
and abdomen. 



CHAPTER XII 

DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

When passing through the body, our nitrogenous foods are con- 
verted into urea and alhed substances, carbonic acid, and water. 
Many proteins and fats contain phosphorus and sulphur, which are 
oxidized to phosphates and sulphates. The organic acids are con- 
verted into alkaline carbonates and water. The mineral acids and 
their salts are excreted cliiefly as carbonates, sulphates, phosphates, 
and chlorides. The waste matters of the body therefore consist 
of urea and its allies, carbonic acid, salts, and water. The liver 
has been called the great depurating organ of the body, and there 
can be no doubt the body depends on the liver to put the nitrogenous 
waste matters into a proper condition for easy excretion But the 
kidneys occupy the first place in the excretion of nitrogenous bodies, 
most of the salts, and a great proportion of the water. Good 
metabolism therefore depends on healthy kidneys. But the kidneys 
alone are not responsible for all the deviations from metabolism 
which occur in regard to the excreted bodies, nor in respect of the 
abnormal conditions of the urine observed in various states of the 
organism. 

Urinary Deposits — ^Gravel and Stones. 

Under certain conditions not 3"et thoroughly understood, the 
urine is unable to retain some portion of its contents in solution, and 
there is the formation of a deposit, gravel, or stone. The nature 
and composition of deposits and concretions differ widely But 
certain characters are associated with stones or gravel having a 
fairly well-known composition. It is usually stated that renal 
calculi consist most frequently of uric acid or urates; but others 
consist of mixed urates and calcium oxalate in layers; and others, 
again, of calcium phosphate or triple phosphate. Professor Moore 
of Liverpool,^ however, made an extended analysis of twenty-four 
calculi which shows that in this series, at any rate, the predominant 
constituent of most calculi is calcium oxalate (see table, p. 388). 

The result of these analyses led Professor Moore to conclude that 
the significance of uric acid and urates in the formation and com- 
position of calculi has been overestimated, that calcium oxalate 
is the primary constituent of stones; and calcium oxalate, calcium 
phosphate, and calcium urate are the commonest components.

DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEAI 



The formation of stones and gravel is predisposed to by a defect 
of metabolism leading to the formation of oxalic acid, uric acid, 
phosphoric acid, and so forth, which unite to form salts with the 
earthy bases. If we suppose that a concretion starts as calcium 
oxalate, the predisposing cause being a faulty metabolism which 
causes the very insoluble calcium oxalate to be excreted in amount 
larger than can be held in solution, and if we take it that this 
growing concretion of calcium oxalate is nowadays usually removed 
by surgical interference before it has grown to such a size that it 
induces secondary changes in the urine and deposition of calcium 
\irate, then we can explain the results obtained in the analyses below.

" If we take it that this calcium oxalate concretion goes on growing, 
causing irritation and infection, and giving a rough foreign surface 
in the kidney, pelvis, or urinar\' bladder, we may then get a second- 
ary deposit of calcium phosphates or acid urates, simply because 
these are the least soluble constituents of the urine, and for reasons 
in no wise connected with the original formation of the stone. 
Such a process of reasoning would explain the urate and phosphate 
formations, and the deposition of the outer rings on the large renal 
concretions of former days. ... It is of little consequence whether 



GRAVEL AND STONES 389 

a degenerated kidney cell or a micro-organism is the nidus around 
which the renal calculus starts to grow, or whether it starts spon- 
taneously, since it is only a certain type of disordered metabolism, 
causing the production of insoluble salts of calcium, which can keep 
it growing. In the presence of this disordered metabolism there will 
be gravel in the urine or stone in the kidney; in its absence, whether 
renal infection be present or absent, there can be no gravel and no 
renal calculi. To classify calculi into primary and secondary in 
the usual manner only causes mystification by exchanging cause 
and effect. Gravel and renal calculi more often lead to infection 
of the kidney than primary kidney affection leads to renal calculi; 
if, indeed, the latter ever occurs. The presence of micro-organisms 
in renal calculi is the absurdest evidence that the stone arose from 
renal infection." ^ 

In addition to the faulty metabolism, there are certain circum- 
stances which predispose to stone formation. One of these is the 
concentration of the urine, whereby a tendency to the deposition 
of insoluble salts in induced. When little water is taken with the 
food while a considerable amount leaves the body by the lungs 
and skin, the urine diminishes in quantity, and is so charged with 
solids that the slightest disturbance may lead to a deposition. If a 
little of the water from such concentrated urine is reabsorbed at 
any point in the urinary passages, the remainder is no longer able 
to retain all the solids in solution, and some is at once precipitated 
in the form of gravel, and tends to the formation of concretions. 
A great drain of water from the system, by diarrhcea, profuse 
perspiration, or anything which lowers the blood-pressure, favours 
the production of gravel and stone. The quantity of urine depends 
on the blood-pressure, for with a decrease in the mass of blood, 
and corresponding lowering of the pressure, there will be a diminu- 
tion of water in the urine. But the waste of the tissues is going 
on as before; and if the waste is passed out through the kidneys, it 
must be as a concentrated solution; and the more concentrated the 
urine the greater is the danger that solids will be deposited in a 
crystalline form and tend to the formation of calculi. It has been 
observed that the formation of calculi in animals is practically 
unknown if they are kept at pasture in summer, or fed liberally on 
roots, potatoes, swedes, pumpkins, apples, or ensilage in winter, 
because these foods are moist, and the urine does not become con- 
centrated. In cattle, calculi and gravel form almost essentially 
a winter disease, which is confined to animals fed with dry fodder 
and denied succulent rations. Therefore an abundance of water in 
the food tends to prevent, and a deficiency to promote, calculus 
formation. 

The presence of a large quantity of lime salts in the water which 
is consumed favours concentration of the urine. If the water contains 
20 to 30 grains of carbonate or sulphate of lime per gallon — a not 
unusual quantity — it must contribute a large addition to the salts

DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 



of the blood and urine. Such salts are not all utilized in the body, 
but are excreted at once in a large measure. It is notorious that 
stone and gravel are prevalent, not only in man, but in herbivora, 
in the limestone and calcareous regions of America and Europe. 
This has been denied by various authorities, but their denial must 
be substantiated by statistics before it can be accepted. It does 
not follow, of course, that an abundance of lime in the water is the 
main cause of calculi, since other poisons are operative in the pro- 
duction of goitre in man and animals living in the same regions, 
and these probably contribute to the causation of calculi. An 
excess of lime can scarceh- fail to assist the saturation of the urine, 
and thereb}' tend to the precipitation of urinary solids. The results 
of feeding cattle with a generous ration of material containing 
phosphate of lime gives additional force to this view. The hberal 
allowance of wheat-bran, given with the idea of increasing bone 
and improving " condition," has resulted in the formation of urinary 
calculi. This may be appreciated when it is stated that the ash of 
wheat-grain is only 3 per cent., that of wheat-bran 7'3 per cent.; 
in the former case 46 38 per cent, of the ash is phosphoric acid, and 
in the latter 50 per cent.

It is therefore evident that wheat-bran contains three times as 
much phosphoric acid as the entire grain, and four times as much 
as there is in oats, beans, peas, and rye; so that an excessive con- 
sumption of foods containing bran would readily overcharge the 
urine with phosphates. Again, wheat-bran contains much more 
albuminoid and other nitrogenous substances than the entire grain 
of wheat or other cereals, whence it follows that the urine may 
contain an excess of urea and other nitrogenous waste products 
which bring it near to the point of saturation. The above table 
shows that, with the exception of oats, none of the cereals contain 
more than two-thirds of the total nitrogenous materials of bran, 
while rye and maize only contain about half as much. Even oats, 
which contain the most digestible albuminoids and those most 
easily transformed into urea, only contain two-thirds the amount 
of that in bran. 



GRAVEL AND STONES 39 1 

The presence of magnesia in the food or water also favours the 
formation of calcuH. The explanation of this is that while the 
phosphate of magnesia is soluble in water, the compound phosphate 
of anmionia and magnesia is insoluble; and if at any time ammonia 
is introduced into the urine containing phosphate of magnesia, there 
is instantly formed the insoluble ammonio-magnesium phosphate, 
which is deposited in a solid form. The common source of ammonia 
in the urine is the decomposition of urea due to fermentation. But 
in order to produce decomposition an enzyme is necessary, and this 
is provided by bacteria which gain admission to the urinary pas- 
sages. The precipitation of magnesium phosphate is favoured also 
by the presence of colloid materials arising from catarrh or inflam- 
mation of the mucous membrane. 

A somewhat less common constituent of calculi is calcium car- 
bonate. It is derived from food and water, and from carbonic 
acid gas arising from the decomposition of organic acids. The 
organic acids of the food are resolved into alkaline carbonates, 
but some of them are completely decomposed into CO2 and water; 
the COo unites with lime in the blood and forms calcium carbonate, 
and some passes into the urine. Calcium carbonate is soluble in 
water which contains free CO.2 in solution, but it is precipitated 
when this gas is withdrawn. It is therefore only necessary to have 
in the urine sufficient Hme or other available base to unite with 
the free COg, which holds most of the calcium carbonate in 
solution, to cause its immediate precipitation in a solid crystalloid 
form. 

The calcium oxalate of calculi arises in the organism in a similar 
manner. The lime is derived from the food or water, and the 
oxalic acid is chiefly a product of the transformation of the organic 
acids or carbohydrates of the food. Some oxalic acid may enter 
the system preformed in various foods. But in consequence of 
some defect in metabolism which causes insufficient oxidation in 
the tissues, there is a failure in the process of the transformation of 
organic acids or carbohydrates, or both, into CO2 and water. Nor- 
mally, the oxidation of these materials is complete, and carbonic 
acid is the final product of decomposition; but when less o.xygen 
is furnished to the body owing to diseases of the lungs or nervous 
system, which lessen the activity of breathing, or insufficient exer- 
cise, which also leads to deficient oxidation, or a deficiency of the 
intracellular enzymes by which the oxidative processes are carried 
out, then oxalic acid may be produced, and if it comes into contact 
with lime, it is precipitated as calcium oxalate. The presence of 
calcium oxalate as an abundant and frequent constituent of calculi 
opens up a field for investigation in metabolism which has not yet 
been thoroughl}' explored. It points unmistakably to embarrassed 
oxidation, or to conditions attending its formation in which oxygen 
is deficient, or there is an insufficiency of the enzymes, now beUeved 
to be of importance in the transformation of proteins, fats, and 
carbohydrates. Moore says; " The association of calcium oxalate. 



39-2 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

calcium phosphate, and calcium urate as the three commonest 
components in this series of calculi (table given above) is most inter- 
esting; and since two of the acids concerned are associated with the 
incomplete oxidation of proteins and carbohydrates, and the third 
(phosphoric acid) is always excreted in greater abundance under 
conditions of diminished oxidation, the suggestion is awakened 
that calculi are found usually in conditions of reduced oxidation 
associated possibly with disordered calcium nutrition or metabo- 
lism. . . . The subjects of renal calculi and gout show a preponder- 
ance of individuals of sedentary occupation or of inactive habits 
of body. The natural disposition and bent of such people is against 
exercise and the increased oxidation which it brings, and affairs 
are made worse by their disposition to pile on more fuel instead of 
lessening the intake, and so to still further check the rate of the 
oxidative processes. . . . But the deposition of insoluble calcium 
salts, under conditions of diminished oxidation, in the kidneys is 
not an isolated and peculiar occurrence, but can be linked up with 
the formation of many types of insoluble calcareous deposits in 
other situations in the body, which at first sight are apparently 
quite different in type and origin." ^ These include the calcification 
of cartilage, the increasing brittleness of the bones in advanced 
age, the formation of chalk stones, the calcification of tuberculous 
foci, and the arterio-sclerosis and calcification of arteries. 

But other conditions enter into the formation of stones and 
gravel. A high densit}' of the urine from an excess of solids or 
deficiency of water may exist for a long time without the formation 
of gravel or stones. If, however, there arises from any cause the^ 
presence of colloidal material, su ch as mucus, blood, al bumin , casts, 
or epithelial cells, it may act as an exciting cause of the concret ion. 
These substances will not only determine the deposition of crystal- 
lizable salts from a strong solution, but they may determine the 
precipitation of such salts in the form of urinary deposits consisting 
of crystalline or minute spheroidal masses, and they form calculi 
b}- accretion. In the case of stones formed by chemical reaction and 
without the intervention of colloids, the salts are deposited in the 
form of sharply defined angular cr3-stals; hence the rough, jagged 
crystals of calcium oxalate and ammonio-magnesium phosphate. 
The action of coUoids in causing the precipitation of dissolved salts 
has been shown by Raine}' and Ord to be intensified by moderate 
heat; the temperature of the kidneys and bladder is a favourable 
condition. When colloids undergo decomposition, they are par- 
ticularly active in producing such precipitation; emd herein lies the 
importance of bacteria as a factor in calculus-formation. A catar- 
rhal inflammation of the bladder, due to bacteria, results in the 
formation of mucus or pus, and the subsequent decomposition of 
mucus and urea may determine the presence of the uncrystallizable 
colloid that is effective in the precipitation of salts and the forma- 
tion of gravel or calculus.

TRliATMIiNT OF STONE 393 

Treulment of Calculus. — Although the most scientific treatment of 
a calculus is its removal from the body by a surgical procedure, 
there is much to be done by other means, and many cases of gravel 
are cured by hygienic and dietetic management. If a calculus 
is immersed in a liquid of a lower specific gravity than its own, or 
that in which it was formed, some of the more soluble constituents 
tend to dissolve out, the density of the body and its cohesion at all 
points is lowered, and its disintegration and expulsion favoured. 
Therefore the consumption of a large quantity of water daily, per- 
sistently and without intermission, will cause a free secretion of 
urine of a low specific gravity, and will tend to obviate the catarrhal 
condition of the urinary mucous membrane and the continued 
deposit and accretion which occur when the urine is more highly 
concentrated. It will likewise press a renal stone downwards 
towards the bladder, favour the crumbling of the stone, the dis- 
integration of a considerable portion of it, and the expulsion of 
detritus. This is what happens during a prolonged stay at the 
source of many mineral waters, and is the result to be looked for 
from spa treatment. Therefore, a prolonged stay at Vittel, Con- 
trexeville, and other places renowned for the cure of gravel and 
stone may be recommended But there are many patients who, 
for various reasons, are unable to spend money and time on treat- 
ment at a fashionable resort. These should be recommended to 
drink large quantities of ordinary water in their own home. The 
chief constituent in mineral waters is water; and this is the solvent 
of gravel and calculi. Doubtless the particular water of fashionable 
spas is better than ordinary spring or river water. But when these 
are unobtainable, the patient should follow out, in his own home, 
the course recommended at the spas. Soft water or rain water is 
a better solvent than hard or spring water. Better still is distilled 
water, and especially the commercial forms, such as Salutaris or 
Puralis, and almost equall}' good are those of low mineralization, 
such as Perrier water. If the patient will consume the same 
quantity of water at home as he would have to do under medical 
supervision at the spa, if he will take it at the same temperature, 
at the same intervals, or distributed throughout the day in the 
same manner, and follow out the same regime with regard to food 
and exercise, he will probably benefit by the treatment nearly as 
much as he would by a visit to the spa. 

The further treatnient of the urinary deposits <md calculi is 
detailed below under special headings. 

Uratic Deposits Uric Acid Gravel and Calculus. — Increased 
excretion of uric acid may be due to -(i) Increased consumption of 
animal food; (2) diminution of the oxidation processes, such as 
occurs in people of sedentary habits; (3) leucocythnemia. Leuco- 
cytes contain nuclein, which decomposes into nucleic acid, and 
finally into purin bodies— adenin, guanin, and hypoxanthin — 
which are closely related to uric acid. A great increase in the 
proportion of white corpuscles of the blood naturallv leads to the 



394 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

formation of such purin bodies which are normally reduced by 
oxidation to urea, but may only reach the stage of uric acid. 

E.xcess of urates and lit hates of ammonia and soda are deposited 
in the urine owing to the following causes: (i) Rapid waste of the 
tissues — e.g., in febrile diseases; (2) excessive consumption of pro- 
teins; (3) congestion of the kidneys; (4) obstruction of the perspira- 
tion — e.g., a chill of the cutaneous surface; (5) indigestion and 
faulty assimilation of food ; (6) imperfect oxidation in the tissues. 

Uric acid gravel, uric acidjemia, and lithremia therefore arise from an 
excessive consumption of proteins, defective nitrogenous metabolism, 
imperfect oxidation in the tissues, diseases of the liver and spleen, 
leucocythsemia, and imperfect elimination of the waste products. 

The formation of a uric acid calculus does not depend solely on 
the amount of uric acid in the urine, for the urine that deposits uric 
acid is often dilute. It may, however, contain an excess of other 
urinary salts, especially calcium oxalate or phosphate, whose 
presence influences the formation of the calculus. But it is con- 
sidered by Rainey and Ord, and other authorities, that a slight 
pyehtis is equally necessary to provide colloid material (mucus, 
pus, albumin, or blood) to cement the particles together. 

The diet is a very important element in the treatment. Uric 
acid is one of the products of metabolism which necessarily goes 
on even during starvation. Its formation and excretion cannot be 
prevented. But we can limit the amount of uric acid derivable 
from the food, do something to encourage metaboHsm, and check 
the deposition of uric acid in the urinary passages by influencing 
the reaction of the urine. Urine which is very acid is more likely 
to deposit uric acid than urine which is less acid. The salines of 
the blood and urine are deficient in lithaemia and uric acid gravel. 
Therefore the subject of these ailments should consume foods which 
are known to be rich in salines, and to eat less of those which do not 
contain them. Stone rarely affects the children of the well-to-do, 
but is far more common in those of the poor. Roberts, who devoted 
many years to the study of the subject, considered the immunity of 
the rich was due to their consuming more meat, which contains the 
sahnes of the blood; and the reason why the poor are so often 
afflicted by it is because they live more on cereals, which are poor 
in salines, and he pointed out that stone is common among the 
rice-eating Hindoos. He therefore prescribed a dietary consisting 
of animal food — meat, fish, fowl, game, oysters, eggs, cheese, and 
milk, with an abundance of fresh vegetables. Potatoes, rice, sago, 
bread, and other farinaceous foods should be eaten sparingly, 
because of their deficiency in salines. But the amount of animal 
food consumed should not exceed the normal requirements of the 
body. Indeed, Klemperer and other authorities believe it is better 
to prescribe a purin-free dietary. They recommend the patient to 
consume milk, cheese, white bread, fruit, and vegetables, to take 
ordinary animal food in great moderation, and avoid all foods con- 
taining substances capable of forming uric acid, especially red meat, 



VHIC ACID GRAVEL 395 

venison, smoked meat, fish, liver, kidneys, sweetbread, tea, coffee, 
and cocoa, and substances containing oxalic acid, such as sorrel 
and tomatoes, and acid beverages. Haig,^ who is one of the 
greatest exponents of the purin-free dietary, formed a different 
opinion of the inhabitants of the North-West Province of India. 
He says: " Among the poorly nourished rice-eating population, 
stone is rare. Among the wheat-eating, meat-eating, and generally 
better-fed provinces it is frequent; and in these provinces it is 
especially common among the men and boys, rare among the 
women and girls; and this is largely due to the diet, for the men 
feed best and the boys with them, the women have their leavings, 
and the girls what they can get, the last-named being very little 
thought of and badly fed." Haig goes on to say this is simple 
enough; " those have most stone who eat most meat, and thus 
introduce uric acid as well." It is quite possible to have an excess 
of uric acid in the body as the result of the constant consumption 
of nitrogen in excess of the physiological requirement, and this is 
the amount required to produce 3I grains of urea per pound of body- 
weight per day. It is, however, in my opinion, sufficient to limit 
the consumption of protein to the needs of the body, and to choose 
the flesh foods which contain the least amount of purins rather 
than to exclude animal foods from the diet. It should not be 
forgotten that caffein, thein, and theobromin are purin bodies; 
and that vegetable foods which contain a large amount of nuclein, 
such as peas, beans, lentils, onions, asparagus, and other vegetables, 
contribute largely to the uric acid manufactured in the body. If 
the processes of metabolism are healthy and the oxidative processes 
normal, the uric acid will be transformed into urea. But in people 
who suffer from uric acid gravel these processes are not normal- 
It is therefore proper to inquire into the food-habits of the patient. 
People in easy circumstances eat a good deal more meat than they 
require, including sweetbreads, devilled kidneys, liver, beef steak, 
game, salmon, venison, and gravy made from spleen or other 
uric-acid-containing substances. Vegetarians, on the other hand, 
eat freely of leguminous foods containing nuclein, which is reduced 
to uric acid. When, therefore, we find that the patient indulges 
in an excess of animal food, let him be put upon a diet of tripe, 
boiled mutton, rabbit, cod, plaice, halibut, fat ham or bacon and 
eggs, with butter, milk, cheese, white bread, macaroni, plenty of 
green vegetables and salads, fresh fruit, and a small amount of 
potatoes. If he is a vegetarian, put him on a diet similar to the 
above, but he must eat sparingly of rice and potatoes, which are 
deficient in salines. 

The patient should not go too many hours without a meal. The 
urine becomes alkaline after a meal {the alkaline wave), but acid 
during the metabolism of food [the acid wave). All the food should 
be well malted. The value of common salt as a preventative or cure 
of gravel and stone is evidenced by the fact that sailors and other 

^ " Uric Acid," p. 558. 



396 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

men who live largely on salted meat or fish are rarely troubled by 
these affections. The same remark applies to people who con- 
stantly drink brackish waters. Another explanation of the fact 
that salted meat and tish do not cause gravel or stone is that by 
curing these foods in this manner some of the soluble nitrogenous 
matters are lost b\- the abstraction of meat juice containing albumin, 
meat bases, and purin bodies, and consequently such foods contain 
less protein and purin bodies than fresh meat or fish does. 

With regard to beverages, milk is useful because it is practically 
purin-free, but it should not be forgotten that it is a nitrogenous 
food, and the amount of protein taken in this way must be reckoned 
in the account. Weak tea is allowable, with plenty of milk or cream. 
Malt liquors are prohibited. Alcohol in any form should be for- 
bidden, because it is believed to increase the excretion of uric acid 
by interfering with oxidation. Opinions differ on this point. 
Klemperer says it is uncertain whether alcohol has any influence 
over the excretion of uric acid. In certain cases a little hock, 
Moselle, Rhine wine, \'olnay, or other wine of a light character, 
may be allow^ed, providing it is diluted with an alkaline water 
such as Apollinaris, Perrier, Evian, Vittel, Contrexeville, or Mar- 
tigny water. The effervescent lithia, potash, or soda-water, may 
be taken ad libitum, and it may be pointed out that carbonate of 
lithia has six times the solvent power of bicarbonate of soda ovet 
uric acid. 

The acidity of the urine must be kept down below a certain level. 
Roberts showed that uric acid normally exists in the urine in the 
form of quadriurates ; and the first step in the precipitation of uric 
acid consists in breaking up the quadriurate into biurate and setting 
some of the uric acid free, which, being but slightly soluble in 
water, is readily precipitated while the biurate remains in solution. 
Vaughan Harley asks: " If this view is correct, what prevents such 
precipitation from always occurring ? It appears to be the sul- 
phates, chlorides, phosphates, and colouring matter that do this, 
but the potassium salts appear to act more powerfully than the 
sodium or ammonium salts, while a fixed alkali entirely prevents 
the change from taking place." The acidity of normal urine is due 
to acid phosphate of soda derived from the blood; and it is sup- 
posed that the basic sodium phosphate is converted into acid sodium 
phosphate by the uric acid, hippuric, sulphuric, and other acids 
taking away part of the sodium, and the basic sodium phosphate 
(Na2HP04) thereby becomes acid sodium phosphate (XaH2P04). 
The appearance of a precipitate of uric acid can only rise from two 
causes: (i) An excessive formation of uric acid, whereby the solvent 
power of the urine is insufficient to keep the increased amount of 
uric acid in solution; or (2) a diminution in the quantity of the 
natural solvents of uric acid, which leads to its precipitation, 
although the quantity of uric acid is normal or less than normal. 
It is advisable, therefore, that the solvent action of the urine be 
aided by various means. The most obvious means is by dilution 



URIC ACID GRAVEL 397 

of tlu' urine with water, and the patient should be encouraged to 
drink freely. But i gramme of uric acid requires 7 litres of water 
for its solution at the temperature of the body; therefore it is im- 
possible to increase the amount sufficiently to prevent precipitation 
by water alone. But the saline and alkaline waters are beneficial 
not only by promoting diuresis and dilution of the urine, but by 
bringing to the urine those salts which reduce its acidity and in- 
crease its solvent power over the uric acid. The patient should 
drink not less than 3 pints of fluids a day. A tumblerful of alkaline 
water should be taken while dressing in the morning, at noon, 
about 5 p.m., and at bedtime. The waters of Vichy, Ems, Vittel, 
Vals, Tarasp, Royat, Contrexeville, Xeuenahr, Apolhnaris, and Evian 
are suitable for "the purpose. The changes may be rung on these 
waters, each in turn being taken for two or three weeks. Fiessinger 
says a season should be passed at Evian or Vittel, but the waters 
of \'ichy and similar places should be avoided lest too great an 
alkalinization of the urine should lead to the precipitation of phos- 
phates, thereby increasing the size of uric acid gravel and leading 
to the formation of large calcuh. If the patient is unable to afford 
a prolonged course of these waters, an alkaline powder which can 
be taken in ordinary water must be prescribed. The most suitable 
is a combination of sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and 
potassium bicarbonate in equal parts. A small teaspoonful of the 
powder in a tumblerful of hot water at the times previously stated 
will dilute the urine, reduce its acidity, and act as a diuretic. The 
greatest danger of precipitation of uric acid occurs during sleep 
or in the early hours of the morning — that is, at the period most 
remote from the last meal, metabolism still progressing, and the 
acid wave being in existence. If the patient is awake in the night, 
he may reduce the acidity of the urine by taking an alkaUne drink, 
for which purpose a dose of the above powder or one of the alkaline 
waters may be taken in milk. Roberts said: " By a prompt resort 
to alkaline remedies patients may protect themselves effectually 
against fresh uric acid concretions, and save themselves a world of 
pain and danger." 

The digestive organs and liver must be kept in order to promote 
the transformation of uric acid and other purin bodies into urea. 
An occasional dose of PuUna, Marienbad, or Carlsbad water, may 
help in these respects. But drastic purgatives must be avoided, 
because they tend to concentration of the urine. Exercise should be 
regularly taken, but the greatest care must be taken in this respect. 
Persons who perspire freely must not indulge in excessive physical 
exercises, because it tends to concentrate the urine and cause a 
precipitation of urates and uric acid. In this respect the treatment 
of uric acid gravel differs from that of gout. Levison found that 
horse-riding increased the amount of uric acid in his urine from 
06 to O'qSi, or even i'oqS grammes per diem. Excessive muscular 
exercise also tends to leucocytosis, and therefore to the destruction 
of nuclein and increase of uric acid. 



398 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

Oxaloria — Oxalic Acid Gravel and Stone. — Oxalic acid occurs in 
the urine in the form of dumb-bell or envelope (octahedral) crystals of 
oxalate of lime. A substance known as " oxaluric acid " (C3H4N2O4) 
occurs in normal urine in small quantities in combination with 
ammonia. Oxalic acid arises from the decomposition of this 
substance, and combines with calcium salts to form oxalate of 
lime. The amount of oxalic acid normall}^ formed in the metabolism 
of the tissues is very small; and the great bulk of acid excreted in 
the urine in the form of oxalates is derived from the food or from 
the products of its decomposition. But the amount of oxahc acid 
is increased in some forms of faulty metabolism, and especially 
from a perverted metabolism of carbohydrates, which is the chief 
cause of endogenous oxaluria. But the exogenous oxalic acid is 
increased by the consumption of certain foods. It is said to arise 
from a vegetarian diet; but it also arises from all foods containing 
oxalates and fruits containing citric acid. Quantities of calcium 
oxalate have been found in the urine after the consumption of 
tomatoes, rhubarb stalks, sorrel, sheep-sorrel, and other vegetables 
and fruit. Even with normal calcium metabolism, if oxalic, phos- 
phoric, or uric acid, begins to be formed in increased amounts, it 
may be expected that they will be deposited as calcium salts. At 
the same time, there is little doubt that, in the case of deposition of 
acids from such dilute solutions as are present in the body fluids, 
any concentration of the kation — calcium — will increase the ten- 
dency to precipitation and cause an increased deposit. When 
recommending a diet after the removal of calculi containing calcium 
salts, it is rational to interdict or diminish foods rich in calcium, such 
as gelatin, milk, oatmeal, entire wheatmea], and some other vegetables. 
Oxaluria also occurs sometimes after the too free use of aerated 
waters, sparkling wines, such as champagne, sparkling hock, or 
Moselle, and malt liquors. Malt liquors nearly all contain appre- 
ciable quantities of calcium salts, which are naturally present in the 
water used for brewing or added for the purpose of making the 
water suitable for the purposes of the brewer. Stout and porter, 
being made with a softer water, contain less lime, and therefore 
are less deleterious than ale or beer. All heavy wines undergo the 
process of "plastering" to remove undesirable ingredients, but 
they obtain thereby an appreciable quantity of calcium salts. 
Being also rich in alcohol, these wines decrease the rate of oxidation 
in the tissues, and tend towards that defective metabolism which 
results in the formation of an increased amount of oxalates and 
urates. 

But oxaluria is sometimes due neither to the presence of oxalates 
and citrates in the food, nor to the decomposition of urine, but to 
some disturbance of the metabolism. Oxalic acid may be formed 
in the stomach in hypochlorhydria and dilatation. But this only 
accounts for very few cases. The formation of large quantities of 
oxalic acid is due to the consumption of food in excess of physio- 
logical requirements, or the ability to metabolize it, oxalic acid and 



OXALURIA 399 

uric acid being produced instead of urea. It often occurs in persons 
who enjoy the pleasures of tlie table. Individuals who become fat 
with good living are healthier and more robust than those who do 
not become fat in the same circumstances, and especially more so 
than those who lose fat. While the former suffer from inconveni- 
ence due to corpulence, the latter complain of all kinds of distresses 
usually ascribed to portal obstruction, haemorrhoids, gout, catarrh 
of the alimentary canal, etc. 'Ihis renders it probable that, when 
there is a disproportion between the supply and demand, and the 
excess is not removed by the formation of fat, the products of 
metabolism are modified, and the system is overloaded with ab- 
normal waste materials. After a long continuance of such dis- 
turbed metabolism,, with indigestion, melancholy, perhaps pharyn- 
geal and bronchial catarrh, or pains in the joints, first one group of 
symptoms and then another becoming prominent, such persons 
become pale, thin, feeble, sleepless, and appear to be threatened 
with some grave affection. Then an examination of the urine 
reveals the presence of calcium oxalate cr^'stals, and other evidences 
of abnormal metabolism. 

The formation of oxalate of lime calculus from mucus was first 
suggested by Meckel. It was he also who first considered that all 
stones originally consist of calcium oxalate, and that the formation 
of a precipitate was unnecessary for the production of calculi. 
The mucous membrane of the urinary passages becomes the seat 
of catarrh, " stone-forming catarrh." A tough mucus is secreted, 
which has a tendency to undergo acid fermentation, and oxalate of 
lime is a product of that fermentation. The oxalate of lime mucus 
is of a gelatinous character. It takes up more and more oxalate 
from the decomposing urine until it becomes somewhat stiff and 
firm, and finally stony. As long as the urine remains decidedly 
acid, the stones grow by accretion, and thus arises the nodulated 
surface, whence it obtains the name of the " mulberry calculus." 

The Treatment of Oxaluria. — ^In the first place an attempt must 
be made to improve the general health by diet and hygienic measures 
to restore the general tone of the body, and especially the digestive 
and metabolic functions. In the majority of cases it will be neces- 
sary io forbid vegetarianism if that mode of feeding has been prac- 
tised. It is essential that the food should be nutritious, and the 
amount of protein prescribed should average lOO grammes per diem, 
at least half the amount being derived from animal foods. An 
excess of animal food, and especially of carbohydrates, should be 
forbidden, and the food should be arranged on normal lines — e.g., 
100 grammes of protein, loo grammes of fat, and 240 grammes of 
carbohydrate. Jellies and gelatin-containing substances should be 
forbidden, for the products of gelatin hydrolysis are glycocoll, 
creatin, and creatinin, all of which cause an increased excretion of 
oxalic acid. One would naturally cut down the consumption of 
all foods known to contain oxalic acid and oxalates — e.g., spinach, 
rhubarb, tomatoes, beetroot, cabbage, celery, haricot beans French

or snap beans; grapes, plums, currants, gooseberries, strawberries, 
raspberries, cranberries, apples, pears, and figs; sorrel, sheep-sorrel; 
pepper; tea, coffee, and cocoa (see table, p. 76). It is also advisable 
to leave out oranges, lemons, lime-fruit, and other fruit or fruit 
juices which contain citric acid. Tocpfer* believes that oxaluria is 
not increased by the consumption of vegetables and fruit containing 
these acids, but that it is always due to defective metabolism of 
calcium or an excessive consumption of calcium salts in the food. 
Niemeyer believed that the use of beverages containing carbonic 
acid had quite a pronounced influence in causing oxaluria and the 
formation of oxalate of lime calculus. Drinking-water which con- 
tains an excess of lime tends to cause a deposit of calcium salts in 
the urinar}- passages. 

The prescription of a vegetable diet, or one which is not rich in 
proteins, is common. Animal food increases acidity, and vegetable 
foods tend to alkalinity of the urine. Moore ^ says: " Such treat- 
ment often fails, and little wonder that it should fail if the two 
most important and abundant constituents of renal calculi are 
calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, the solubility of both of 
which is enormously decreased b}^ increasing the alkalinity of 
the urine. Calcium oxalate is the more common and abundant 
of the two; and is increased in amount by a vegetable diet. 
Again, while the patient is prohibited the purin-rich animal pro- 
teins, containing the progenitors of the obnoxious uric acid, no 
one suspects the harmless milk pudding or interdicts the ripe 
Stilton cheese, which becomes much beloved when other animal 
proteins are cut low. Yet these forms of milk proteins load up 
the body with calcium, which base is always present, whether the 
main bulk of the calculus be oxalate or phosphate or urate. The 
calcium salt of each of these acids is the most insoluble one which 
exists, and that is the reason why it is the invariable one present 
in calculi.'/ 

A different diet is necessary according to the type of patient who 
has oxaluria. A meat diet is necessary for the man w^ho has sper- 
matorrhoea, diabetes, etc.; but the gouty man, the man who does 
not metabolize proteins properly, should have his protein adapted 
to his capacity for dealing with it. In some cases it is necessary 
to restrict carbohydrates, and especially sugar and sweetened foods. 
Klemperer says we should prescribe those foods which contain a 
minimum of calcium and a maximum of magnesium salts. He 
allows any kind of meat or fish, excepting animal glands, but he 
excludes milk and eggs on account of the relatively great amount 
of hme in them. He allows any kind of fat, except the yolk of 
eggs. He prescribes apples and potatoes, and considers stale bread 
and rusks to be the best carbohydrates; but he also permits rice, 
barley, maize, dried peas, beans, and lentils. The patient should 
avoid sweetbread, liver and kidney, gravy made from spleen;

OXALURIA 401 

jellies, fruit, and vegetables (except the pulses) ; tea, coffee, cocoa, 
and chocolate; rich cakes, pastry, and all rich and indigestible foods. 
The beverages allowable are water, weak tea or coffee, possibly a 
littk' stout or porter, and a small amount of whisky in certain cases. 
Kkinpcrcr considers whisky, weak coffee, or beer, and water neither 
increase nor diminish the excretion of oxalic acid; but alcohol tends 
to increiuse the defect of metabolism, which leads to the formation 
of oxalic acid, and to decrease the processes of oxidation 

In persons whose occupation is sedentary, and those whose 
natural disposition is against exercise, affairs are made worse by 
anything which tends to upset the processes of metabolism. These 
people, " instead of lessening the intake, often pile on more fuel, 
and so still further check the rate of the oxidative processes." 
These are the persons who are most benefited by a course of treat- 
ment at Contrexeville, Vittel, Carlsbad, Wildungen, Evian, and 
other places, where a course of alkaline waters is prescribed, and 
probably the most important result which follows is due to their 
influence on the general metabolism. Moore,^ however, says: " The 
alkaline waters and alkaline medication at home are probably of 
little value. These forms of treatment are based on the solubilities 
of the supposed preponderating uric acid and urates, but the solu- 
bilities of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate are exactly the 
reverse, and, if these solubilities give a true index, acid treatment 
is more indicated than alkaline." Johnston-Lavis" of Beaulieu 
says: " The thesis which Moore holds is that lime should be with- 
held from oxalurics. That is a consummation to be devoutly 
wished, but impossible of achievement Xo dietary can be planned 
which shall reduce the calcium so low as to be insufiicient to com- 
bine with the few centigrammes of oxalic acid excreted daily, even 
by an advanced oxaluric. Surely, if this oxahc acid is neutralized 
by the lime salts of our food, any additional amount of lime cannot 
do further harm. But the problem is not to prevent the introduc- 
tion of calcium salts, but the absorption of exogenous oxalic acid 
in the foodstuffs or the perverted metabohsm of carbohydrates 
from which the endogenous oxalates are derived Another problem 
is to prevent the accretion of calcic oxalates as a stone in the urinary 
passages. This cannot be done by calcium starvation. It has 
been tried and failed. . . . Two dominant factors are clearly 
demonstrable at Vittel, where we use a non-chloride calcareous 
water. . . . One is that large numbers of oxalurics resort to Vittel 
yearly, and the other that the diurnal amount of oxalates is markedly 
diminished, and frequently disappears. . . . The cure removes 
their stock of oxalates and improves their metabolism of carbo- 
hydrates so much that they form no more oxalic acid." 

There is no doubt about the value of change of scenery or com- 
panions, pleasant surroundings, fresh air, freedom from worry or 
tranquillity of mind in improving the metabolism. Patients may 
be sent to Vittel, Evian, Contrexeville on the Continent; or to

Buxton, Malvern, or Leamington in England. The treatment may 
be assisted by cold bathing or douching, followed by friction of the 
surface, and proper exercise, especially walking, golf, quoits, 
tennis, etc. 

Phosphaturia.- — The amount of phosphoric acid normally leaving 
the bod}' a\-erages 3 grammes daily. Two classes of phosphates 
occur in normal urine — viz., alkaline phosphates, including sodium 
phosphate, wliich is abundant, and potassium phosphate, which is 
scanty; and earthy phosphates, of which calcium phosphate is abun- 
dant and magnesium phosphate scanty. 

The composition of the phosphates in the urine is very Uable to variation. 

1. Acid urine contains the acid salts which give rise to the acid reaction; 
these are chielly: 

(i) Sodium di-hydrogen phosphate, NaH2P04. 
(2) Calcium di-hydrogen phosphate, Ca(H2P04)2. 

2. Neutral urine, in addition to the foregoing, contains: 

(i) Di-sodium hydrogen phosphate, Na2HP04. 

(2) Calcium hydrogen phosphate, CaHP04. 

(3) Magnesium hydrogen phosphate, MgHP04. 

3. Alkaline urine contains, in addition to or instead of the foregoing: 

(i) Normal sodium phosphate, Na3P04. 

(2) Normal calcium phosphate, Ca3(P04)2. 

(3) Normal magnesium phosphate, Mg3(P04)2. 

Healthy and normal urine may contain a precipitate of the earthy phos- 
phates of lime and magnesia, in starlike crystals or rosettes, if it is rendered 
alkaline by ammonia. Decomposing urine contains ammonia formed from 
urea ; this renders the urine alkaline, and causes the precipitation of earthy 
phosphates. This urinary deposit has for the most part the appearance of a 
creamy-white precipitate, and it consists of triple phosphate (NH4.Mg.P04-f- 
6H2O) in the form of coffin-lid shaped crystals or irregular, six-sided plates. 

Ihe phosphoric acid in the urine chielly originates from the proteins of the 
food and tissues, but also partly from the phosphcrized constituents of the 
food — e.g., nuclein, nucleo-proteins, phospho-proteins, lecithin, cholesterin, 
cerebrin, etc. 

An excess of phosphates in the urine is due to various causes: (i) It 
arises from catarrh of the bladder, or cystitis, and especially from 
the fermentation which decomposes urea into ammonia. The 
ammonia combines with phosphate of magnesia, and forms am- 
monio-magnesium or triple phosphate. There are various bacteria 
which produce ammoniacal fermentation of the urine, and decom- 
pose mucus. The part played by mucus and other cohoid sub- 
stances in forming a calculus in the bladder is an important one. 
According to the theory promulgated long ago by Meckel, as long 
as the urine remains acid, only uric acid is deposited, and a stone 
may be formed with uric acid as a nucleus; but when catarrh arises, 
and is perhaps aggravated by the presence of a calculus, the urine 
becomes alkahne, and phosphates are thrown down, and cause the 
secondary formation of phosphates which surround such nuclei. 

(2) An excess of phosphates in the urine may arise in conse- 
quence of persistent brain work {nervotis phosphaturia), mental 
strain, worry, and diseases of the nervous system. (3) Persistent 



PHOSPHATURIA 403 

phospliaturia, sometimes lasting for years, may occur in persons 
who habitually consume too much phosphorus in their food {physio- 
logical phosphaturia). The deposition of phosphates occurs because 
the urine is unable to keep them in solution, and it is favoured by 
a tendency to alkalinity of the urine. 1 he phosphorus-containing 
food in excess is usually protein, and it is not necessarily animal 
protein. It may be the patient consumes too much vegetable food 
(which tend towards alkalinity of the urine), especially leguminous 
foods, such as lentils, peas or beans, wholemeal bread, brown bread, 
oatmeal, and other foods containing phosphates. Dyspeptic per- 
sons and others who follow sedentary occupations, and whose work 
is chiefly mental, are often vegetarians or consume a good deal of 
vegetables. The sulphur and phosphorus of all proteins become 
transformed into sulphuric and phosphoric acid during metabolism, 
and their combination with bases leads to the formation of sulphates 
and phosphates; hence phosphates arise from the metabolism of 
vegetable and animal proteins as well as from the inorganic phos- 
phates of the food. 

The presence of phosphorus in many of the important tissues of 
the body led to a discussion on the utility of the phosphates in whole- 
meal or brown bread, and the supplementary addition of inorganic 
phosphates to various foods. But the inutility of a large propor- 
tion of the inorganic phosphates normally present in foods was 
shown by the fact that insoluble earthy phosphates were excreted 
chiefly in the faeces, and the soluble phosphates were totally excreted 
in the urine. As a general rule, we take more phosphates in our 
food than we require to replace those lost by tissue metabolism. 

The Treatment of phosphaturia is chiefly dietetic and hygienic. 
Fresh air, change of scenery, and freedom from work are important 
items. Cessation from excessive mental work or study is equally 
important. The sedentary man must tind some occupation or 
" hobby " which will cause him to exercise his muscles. A man 
of means may ride, drive, hunt, shoot, and play golf; others must 
walk, play cricket, tennis, and so forth. The melancholy individual 
must And a cheerful occupation or one which will keep him from 
thinking too much about his own condition. In this connection it 
may be said that active work of a philanthropic nature usefully 
counteracts moroseness, despondency, and introspection. If the 
patient has practised vegetarianism, he must take a more rational 
diet, including 80 to 100 grammes of protein, half of which should 
be from the animal kingdom. If he has been in the habit of con- 
suming too much animal food, his diet should be that recommended 
for the gouty. Both classes of patients should avoid legumes, 
brown bread, wholemeal bread, and oatmeal, and the dietary should 
consist chiefly of meat, eggs, milk, cheese, cereals, and milk puddings. 

If vesical catarrh or pyelitis is a contributory factor, the treatment 
must be directed against that ailment; but the diet should be the 
same as for other forms of phosphaturia. It is easier to render the 
urine alkaline than to produce the opposite condition, for the 



404 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

carbonates and \egetable salts of the food ai'e excreted as alkaline 
carbonates. Benzoic acid, which is excreted as hippuric acid, is 
theoretically adapted for increasing the acidity of the urine and for 
the solution of phosphatic calculi; but its continued use is apt to 
upset the digestive organs. Tartaric and citric acids have a good 
effect in some cases. 1 herefore fruits containing benzoic acid, 
tartaric acid, and citric acid may form a part of the regular dietary 
in phosphaturia. These include lemons, limes, grape-fruit, oranges, 
gooseberries, strawberries, currants, cherries, grapes, plums, green- 
gages, etc. 

Cases of phosphatic albuminuria may be sent to St. Nectaire 
(France), whose waters are considered by Fiessinger to be sovereign 
in this complaint. 

Pyuria. — There are various causes of pus in the urine^ — e.g., 
calculus, catarrh of the urinary passages, pyelitis, especially bacillary 
pyelitis, abscesses, and ulceration of the mucous membrane. 

Treatment. — Calculous pyelitis can only be cured by the removal 
of the stone. But pending an operation the patient should have a 
dietary for oxaluria or phosphaturia. In catarrhal or rheumatic 
pyehtis a few da3's' rest in bed, warm baths, warm alkaline drinks, 
barley-water, linseed tea, or slippery-elm-bark tea, and similar 
demulcent beverages are useful. In bacihary pyelitis alkaline- 
waters form the backbone of dietetic treatment; but an abundance 
of distilled water will have a good effect. Local applications, such 
as warm baths, mustard plasters, leeches, or dry cupping to the 
loins, are more or less soothing. The food must consist of milk, 
milk and barley-water or alkaline-water, milk pudding, jelly, eggs, 
a little fish, vegetables and cooked fruit, bread-and-butter, and tea. 

When the pyuria is due to C3'stitis, the urine will probably be 
ammoniacal, and the alkaline treatment useless. Mucilaginous 
drinks are more suitable, but lime-water may be useful, from ^ to 
2 pints daily being taken with milk. 

When pyuria is recurrent, as, for instance, in pregnant women, 
the pyelonephrosis or pyelocystitis may be prevented by carefully 
dieting the patient. In such cases the food must be free from 
decomposable substances, such as high game or meat, old cheese, 
etc. The ahowance of meat must be reduced to a small quantity 
at one meal a day. The food should consist of 3 or 4 pints of 
skim milk daily, one or two eggs, white meat or fish once a day, 
with green vegetables, porridge, macaroni, vermicelli, etc., ad 
libitum. 

Albuminuria. 

The following classification of albuminuria and its causes is by 
Fiessinger, in " Mementos therapeutiques des Practiciens ": 

I. Tuberculous Albuminuria. — (i) Primary bacillary nephritis, 
due to local tuberculosis, ending in caseo-ulceration of the kidney. 
(2) Secondary or tuberculin nephritis, caused by toxins elaborated 
in distant foci. 



I 



ALP.IMIXURIA 405 

2. Syphilitic AUmininuria. — (i) Second stage, resembling acute 
nephritis; (2) third stage, the hepato-renal form, with hard and 
painful liver, possibly jaundice, and ascites. 

3. Exogcnom Toxic Alhuminuria.—Dne to the passage through 
the kidneys of metabolic or irritant poisons— lead, arsenic, mer- 
cury, phosphorus, cantharidcs, turpentine, and balsams. 

4. EitdogcnoHs Toxic Albwninuyia.-~Duv to disturbances of 
nutrition, (i) Arthritism, gout, diabetes, burns, and skin diseases. 

(2) Digestive and hepatic disturbances, cancerous cachexia, over- 
work or strain. (3) Infection starting from the mouth, alimentary 
canal, or biliary canals. 

5. Infectious Alhuminuria. — Influenza, scarlatina, diphtheria, 
typhoid fever, pneumonia, cholera, articular rheumatism, mumps, 
etc. 

6. Nervous Albuminuria. — Neurasthenia, polyneuritis, epilepsy, 
hysteria, cerebral haemorrhage, general paralysis, locomotor ataxy, 
Graves's disease, cyclical albuminuria, local application of turpentine 
to the skin, other forms of peripheral stimulation. 

7. Mechanical Alhuminuria.- — (i) Venous stasis due to : [a) pri- 
mary heart affections; (h) dilatation of the heart consequent upon 
pulmonary diseases and other causes of obstruction; (c) arterio- 
cardiopathies, in which the kidneys are first involved, due to renal 
lesions, and not to renal stasis. (2) Orthostatic albuminuria. 

(3) Calculus, causing mechanical irritation. 

Albuminuria, therefore, is due to a variety of causes, physio- 
logical and pathological. A minority of the cases are due to 
disease of the kidneys; and the majority to an altered state of the 
blood or failure in the vasomotor mechanism. The disturbances 
of the blood are due to indigestion and malnutrition in a person 
with idiosyncrasies ; and the vasomotor disturbances are often 
associated with excesses in athletics, tobacco, venery, masturba- 
tion, oxaluria, exposure to wet and cold, etc. There is, for instance 
the simple continuous albuminuria in young adults who present 
no evidence of nephritis. There are no casts, but a continual slight 
albuminuria, not influenced by position. Then there is the cyclical 
and orthostatic albuminuria of early adult hfe, common in lads 
about puberty. The albuminuria only occurs or is much exag- 
gerated on assuming the erect posture Castaigne divides these 
cases into — {a) Typical nephritis, in which the albumin urea is 
aggravated by posture or walking; [h) pyrexial albuminuria of 
undoubted renal origin, aggravated by erect posture, common at 
the end of acute stage or in convalescence from nephritis; (c) pyrexial 
albuminuria from infectious diseases; {d) albuminuria apparently 
functional, but aggravated by erect posture, which on investiga- 
tion turns out to be renal, sometimes called " residual albuminuria" ; 
{e) typical orthostatic albuminuria. In the latter there is no renal 
inadequacy, and no evidence of previous nephritis; the albuminuria is 
not continuous ; it only comes on after assuming the upright posture, 
and reaches a maximum in the middle of the day, when it may 



406 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

form 20 per cent, of the urine, and declines in the evening. It is 
due to a disturbance of the vasomotor system, and the urine con- 
tains serum-albumin and serum-globulin. The blood-pressure 
falls from 120 or 125 millimetres to 90 or 95 millimetres of Hg on 
assuming the upright posture. This is the reverse of normal, and 
arises from arterial Itypotonus in the splanchnic area; the blood 
accumulates in the visceral vessels, the kidnevs become hyperaemic, 
and there is a transudation of blood-plasma through the glomerular 
vessels. These patients as a rule are nervous, have moist, clammy 
hands, a low-tension pulse, and other indications of vasomotor 
instability, such as headache, blushing, etc. In another group of 
cases the intermittent albuminuria is due to a rise of blood-pressure 
in the splanchnic area, which is maintained long enough to cause 
hyperemia of the kidneys and transudation of albumin. Later 
in life the albuminuria may be due to general hypertonus arising 
from toxic causes ; when the blood-pressure reaches 200 millimetres 
of Hg, the renal filter is forced, and albumin occurs in the urine. 
Intermittent albuminuria of a matutinal tvpe sometimes occurs in 
the offspring of tuberculous persons. This is regarded by Fiessinger 
as a grave warning. The urine is copious, of high specific gravity 
at the same time the health fails and the patient loses weight; 
[pretuhercular alhiiminuria) ; but when definite signs of pulmonary 
tuberculosis appear, the albuminuria disappears. When this form 
occurs in adults, it is often thought that the albuminuria is of a 
digestive origin, until a cough occurs and friction sounds are heard 
at the apex. 

Alimentary Albuminuria.^ — ^This ailment occurs onh' in persons 
having an idiosyncrasy. The albumin appears after an excessive 
meal or prolonged muscular work, and never after fasting or periods 
of ordinary work. Ordinary food does not give rise to it, but an 
excess of some particular food — raw eggs, cheese, pastry, walnuts, 
etc. There is no such thing as physiological albuminuria; it is a 
pathological sign. Even when an excess of raw eggs causes albu- 
minuria, the urine does not contain egg-albumin, but serum- 
albumin, which is small in amount and disappears with the resump- 
tion of ordinary diet. Grainger Stewart gave much attention to 
this subject. Leube studied it, and concluded that it only occurs 
in persons who are born with an abnormality of the renal structure 
and diminished resistance to the passage of albumin. It was also 
studied by Castaigne, who divided it into — (i) Dysfe-ptic albu- 
minuria, the most frequent; (2) albuminuria of a dyspeptic type 
occurring in persons with chronic nephritis; and (3) essential diges- 
tive albuminuria occurring in healthy people. Castaigne finds all 
people with marked dyspepsia may have slight albuminuria, but 
it is especially noticeable in atony and dilatation of the stomach. 
The liver is large, the urine contains serum-albumin and globulin, 
often peptones, excess of urates and phosphates. There is no 
evidence of nephritis, but if the albuminuria lasts a long time, even 
though the stomach improves, chronic nephritis is slowly evolved. 



.UJlUMlXniUA 407 

Many people with chronic nephritis have no albuminuria under 
ordinary circumstances, but it occurs after an indiscretion in diet. 
It causes a doubtful profrnosis. Essential digestive albuminuria 
occurs chiefly in healthy younf? men with no pathological disturb- 
ance, but an idiosyncrasy to some food. When heterologous albu- 
min is introduced into the blood or subcutaneous tissues, the body 
gets rid of it at once by means of the kidneys. In normal digestion 
heterologous albumins arc broken down and transformed to homol- 
ogous albumin ; but if the digestion of protein is disordered, some 
of the heterologous albumin is absorbed unchanged, and rapidly 
rejected by the bod\-. The prognosis is usually good. 

The Treatment of Albuminuria. — It is common for the physician 
to look on all cases of albuminuria, for which no cause can be found, 
as cases of obscure renal disease. This is an error. A youthful 
person might be converted into a chronic invalid bv treating him 
as a case of Bright's disease. In simple continuous albuminuria the 
patient needs full nourishing diet, reasonal)le exercise, general 
hygiene, and tonic treatment. In orthostatic albuminuria greater 
care is necessary respecting running, jumping, football, and other 
violent exercises. All the patients suffer from vasomotor disturb- 
ances, and are the victims of more or less renal trouble, which call 
for special diet and hygiene. Lacto-vegetarian diet is better than 
others for them, but they may have two eggs daily or a small 
helping of meat or fish at the midday meal. They should take 
very little wine, beer, salt, or coffee They must avoid high game 
or meat, shellfish, spiced dishes, and indigestible foods. They 
should rub their skin with a rough towel once a day, wear flannel 
next the skin, and avoid catching cold. Youthful patients must 
have light, agreeable mental work and short lessons. There should 
be an inquiry into the habits (self-abuse, etc.). Castaigne recom- 
mends an annual visit to St. Nectaire, Evian, Vittel, Brides, or 
Vichy, according as nervousness, dyspepsia, gout, or obesity pre- 
dominates. In alimentary albuminuria the treatment of atony of 
the stomach improves the condition, and the albumin usually 
disappears from the urine. In nephritic persons the albuminuria 
will be lessened by improving the digestion. Essential dyspeptic 
albuminuria should be treated like orthostatic albuminuria. 

In residual albuminuria and those cases due to arterial hyper- 
tonus, arterio-sclerosis, mitral disease, venous engorgement, and 
arrested Bright's disease, the food should contain about 80 grammes 
of protein, about one-half being in animal foods. There need be 
no restriction of food so far as the kidneys are concerned, provided 
it is well and carefully cooked, tender, light, and easily digested. 
But it is necessary to consider the stomach and the arterial tension. 
If the patient has an idios3Ticrasy to'eggs or other foods, they 
must be avoided. If the albuminuria is associated with atony and 
dilatation of the stomach, gastro-intestinal fermentation, or enlarge- 
ment and torpidity of the liver, the amount of meat and fish ought 
to be limited; white meats, such as fowl and rabbit, are preferable 



4o8 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

for their easy digestibility. The amount of milk and vegetables 
should be increased. In these cases Castaigne finds it better to 
curtail the allowance of animal foods, avoiding underdone meat 
and raw eggs, and allowing lacto-vegetarian dietary (milk, legumes, 
fruit and nuts, etc.). When oxaluria and phosphaturia exist, 
treatment of these diseases will probably cure the albuminuria. 

Albuminuria occurring in nervous diseases may necessitate a 
change in the regime. In Graves's disease it would not require any 
change from the ordinary treatment for that disease. But in 
general paralysis or locomotor ataxy an endeavour should be made 
to discover and remove the cause; it might be toxic, renal, or 
nervous. If it occurs in an epileptic patient, the treatment must 
depend on the time of its occurrence. Nothing can be done if it 
comes on just after a fit. But if it appears between the fits, the 
patient should be put on a salt-free diet of the lacto-vegetarian 
variety. If the arterial tension is very high or uraemia is threaten- 
ing, a milk-and-water diet, aided by purgation and venesection, 
is the proper treatment. The same treatment is called for in 
albuminuria after cerebral haemorrhage or injuries to the cranium, 
if the arterial tension is high ; the fluids should not exceed 2 pints a 
day. 

The albuminuria of neurasthenics may be central in origin — e.g., 
phosphatic albuminuria- — or due to gastro-intestinal and hepatic 
disorder, or a sequela of some infectious disease. When the albu- 
minuria is clearly " residual," it would be better to treat the 
neurasthenia with generous diet without regard to the albumin, 
merely leaving out those articles detrimental to the kidneys. If, 
however, the albuminuria depends on renal inadequacy and high 
arterial tension, the neurasthenic will have hypertonus, headache, 
digestive and hepatic disturbances, which are better treated by a 
lacto-vegetarian and salt-free diet. In other neurasthenics, usually 
over fifty years of age, the albuminuria is independent of the 
kidneys, and, according to Fiessinger, due to a neuro-arthritic con- 
dition. These persons usually present h\'potonus, although the 
coefficient of oxidized nitrogen in the urine is normal {i.e., 85 per 
cent, is urea-nitrogen, and 15 per cent, other nitrogenous bodies). 
This form usualh' demands generous diet of the ordinary mixed 
kind; but if the low tension pulse is associated with gastro-intestinal 
and hepatic toxaemia, the food should be the same as for that 
condition. 

Acute Bright's Disease. 

A study of the products of metabolism eliminated during the 
course of acute nephritis led Von Noorden to conclude: (i) The 
imperfectly eliminated bodies are urea, creatinin, hippuric acid, 
phosphates, sulphates, potassium and sodium salts, colouring 
matter, and water. (2) The matters tolerably well eliminated are 
uric acid, xanthin bases, aromatic substances, amino-acids, am- 
monium salts, carbonates, chlorides, and sometimes water. The 



ACUTE NEPHRITIS 4"9 

imperfcctlv rliininatiHl inalttrs rapidly accumulate in the body; 
the retention of urea and salts, especially sodium chloride, is a 
factor contributory to the production of (edema. While it is 
important to relieve the system by promoting the action of the 
bowels and skin with purgatives, warm baths, wet-packs, hot-air 
baths, and diaphoretics, it is equally important that the solid cylinders 
of detritus and exudation matter should be removed from the 
renal tubules To this end the patient may be encouraged to take 
large draughts of water, which have a diuretic effect by increasing 
the blood-pressure. The best drinks are gaseous alkaline waters, 
■ potash, soda, Apollinaris or Perricr waters; but \'als, \'ichy. or Ems 
water, takt-n warm, has a good effect. The imperial drink is a 
valuable diuretic. Fruit juices taken in plain hot water are also 
useful (apple-water, black-currant tea, raspberry vinegar, and 
lemonade). The conversion of the organic acids into alkaline 
carbonates promotes diuresis, while they quench thirst and refresh 
the patient. Demulcent drinks— linseed tea, barley-water, oatrneal- 
water, etc. — were formerly considered soothing to the renal epithe- 
lium; but they are practically useless for that purpose, but should 
not be despised as beverages or diluents. As a general rule the 
patients may have such fluids unrestrained. But there is a small 
percentage of cases of acute nephritis in which the tubules are so 
completely blocked up that the kidneys cannot excrete it. In these 
cases the amount of liquid consumed should be limited, in a reason- 
able degree, not forgetting that warm liquids encourage diaphoresis, 
which is necessary to relieve the system of some of the toxins and 
water. 

If vomiting is a marked feature of the illness, try some peptonized 
milk, and allow the patient to suck small pieces of ice, take iced 
lemonade, and Perrier or Apollinaris w^ater. The mineral waters 
should not be spared in such a case, because the carbonic acid gas 
assists in checking the vomiting, and the increased blood-pressure 
arising from their ingestion may cause an increased transudation 
through the glomeruli and wash away the obstructing coagula. 
A mustard plaster over the epigastrium may also be useful in 
checking the vomiting. 

The food should consist entirely of milk, whey, and butter- 
milk for a few days. There is no doubt that the excretion of 
nitrogen is seriously interfered with, and, whatever the desire of 
the patient may be^ we must keep down the supply of nitrogenous 
food. Indeed, "it is laid down by Hutinel that the treatment of 
acute nephritis with anasarca should always be started with a water- 
diet; and many authorities are in favour of all food being cut off 
for twenty-four to thirty-six hours, even when there is no anasarca, 
if the urine is suppressed, merely allowing alkaline-waters and 
demulcent drinks. There is no difficulty in doing this if the patient 
suffers from nausea and vomiting. But the majority of cases are 
not sufficientlv severe to necessitate absolute abstention from food. 
As a general rule, even in the worst cases, whey and buttermilk 



410 DISEASES OF THE UPTNARY SYSTEM 

may be given if the patient is conscious, and usually about i pint 
of milk a daj', well diluted, and in small doses. Whey and butter- 
milk, however, are specially suitable at this stage, especially when 
milk disagrees; they contain an amount of casein in an altered 
condition, besides lactalbumin, milk sugar, and lactic acid; they 
have a diuretic effect, and the nutriment in them can be increased 
somewhat b)- the addition of a tablespoonful of cream to each 
tumblerful. 

^Moreover, there are very many cases where whole milk may be 
given, especially where dropsy exists. In these patients the 
diminution in the excretion of urine is partly due to the dropsy, 
the kidne3's not being so seriously impaired as in those cases where 
there is suppression of the urine, but no dropsy. Milk is the 
nitrogenous food least irritating to the kidneys. The amount 
given should in no case exceed 2 pints a day, but some cream 
ma\' be added to increase the quantity of fat; and it ought to 
be diluted with one of the mineral or demulcent waters already 
named. 

After twenty-four or forty-eight hours, if the vomiting is allayed, 
the patient may have some oatmeal gruel, a little bread-and-butter, 
and some sweetened tea. If the arterial tension is low, some strong 
coffee may be given; but if the tension is markedly high, both tea 
and coffee are contra-indicated. Alcohol is also contra-indicated. 
All meat juices, extracts, or essences, soups and broths are for- 
bidden, because their nitrogenous extractives add to the mass of 
effete materials already waiting for the removal of the block in the 
kidnej'S. Neither should salt be added to the food, as it assists 
in retaining water in the tissues, and adds to the previously accu- 
mulated chlorides. 

After a few days the diet may be improved by increasing the 
amount of bread-and-butter, and the addition of custard, junket, 
milk puddings, farinaceous foods, and stewed fruit. But no meat 
or fish should be allowed until the urine is free from albumin. 
As the s^Tnptoms subside, a little piece of steamed fish (sole, plaice, 
whiting, haddock, or turbot) may be given. When the last trace 
of albumin has disappeared, some poached or boiled eggs, and a 
little chicken, may be allowed with some mashed potato, cauli- 
flower, vegetable marrow, or spinach. But as a general rule butchers' 
meat should not be permitted for two or three weeks from the com- 
mencement of the illness. By this time kidney beans, cabbage, 
lettuce, tomatoes, watercress, and fresh ripe fruit can be added to 
the diet. It is impossible to give a dietarv which will be applicable 
to every case, but the following one would be suitable for the 
average case: 

First and Second Days. — Milk, 20 to 30 ounces, diluted with much car- 
bonated water (soda, potash, Perrier, or Apollinaris water), bailey -water, 
rice-water, or lime-water; it should be taken in sips. Imperial drink, whey, 
buttermilk, toast-water, apple-water, fruit-juice and water. Ice to suck, 
lime-water and milk, or bicarbonate of potash in milk to check vomiting. 
The total liquid should be at least 4 pints. 



ACUTE NEPHRITIS 411 

Third Day. — Milk, 2 pints, well diluted. Custard, junket, cooked apple, 
cream. Oatmeal and milk with glucose. Savory and Moore's or Benger's 
food. Bread-and-butter, a cup of tea. 

Fourth Day. — IMilk, 2 to 3 pints ; the other articles in greater quantity. 

Fifth to Seventh Day. — Milk, 3 to 4 pints; milk pudding, custard, junket. 
Bread-and-butter, stewed fruit and cream. 

Eighth Day. — Steamed fish, potato puree, vegetable marrow, boiled lettuce, 
spinach. Milk puddings, stewed fruit, etc. 

Fourteenth Day. — Fish, potato, boiled vegetables. Tripe. Pioiled or 
poached eggs. Other things as before. 

Eighteenth Day. — Chicken and oysters may be added to the list. 

Twenty-First Day. — Butcher's meat and full diet. 

Von Noorden arranges the dietary for acute nephritis according 
to the severity of the disease, (i) In severe cases, in which the 
urine is suppressed or scanty, and there is danger of ur?emia, he 
limits the food to | htre (17J ounces) of milk daily. Ice is allowed, 
but he limits the intake of water to the smallest quantity, at the 
same time encouraging the removal of water from the tissues by 
diaphoresis. Such a dietary could not be continued more than 
four or five days, but by the end of that period the patient would 
either be dead from uraemia or his kidneys would show signs of 
returning activity, and more food and water could be allowed. 
(2) In less severe cases, with scanty urine, a moderate degree of 
oedema, but no present danger from ursemia, he prescribes i| litres 
(3I pints) of milk and \ litre (17I ounces) of sweet cream. (3) In 
convalescence from acute nephritis he prescribes 2\ litres (4I pints) 
of milk daily. This contains 80 grammes of protein. In addition 
he allows rice, bread, potatoes, peas and beans, and later on an 
egg or a small amount of meat, but in such quantities that the 
total quantity of protein does not exceed 100 grammes, and 25 
grammes of urea should be excreted by the kidneys. 

In 1905 Dufour^ advocated a chloride-free diet for scarlatinal 
nephritis. He considered this renal complication of scarlatina to 
be serious, and the excess of chlorides throws additional work on 
the injured kidneys, whence arises the oedema, casts, and albu- 
minuria so well known in scarlatinal nephritis. He holds that 
these symptoms are a contra-indication to the milk diet. He 
therefore prescribes a chloride-free diet, consisting of soup, eggs, 
cream, puree of vegetables, nuts, sweetbread, cream or other fat, 
and bread without salt. The drink should consist of Evian water 
and other alkaline diuretic fluids. The treatment aims at resting 
the kidneys, and under it he claims that all the symptoms speedily 
disappear. 

Comby recommends the advisability of maintaining a milk diet 
for three weeks in scarlatinal nephritis, and a lacto-vegetarian 
diet for three weeks longer. 

In the acute nephritis from infectious diseases, such as influenza, 
pneumonia, typhoid, scarlatina, diphtheria, etc., no difference from 
the dietary given above is necessary. Rest in bed, milk diet, and

412 DISEASFS OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

plenty of water to wash out the debris from the renal tubules, is 
usually sufficient. Milk diet is especially essential for cases of 
nephritis with a tendency to uraemia, and salt-free diet for nephritis 
with oedema. The disease should not become chronic if it is 
adequately treated in the acute stage, and the milk and salt-free 
diet sufficiently prolonged. If a case becomes subacute, no meat 
or fish should be allowed, especially if the heart is failing or uraemia 
threatens. If the subacute stage is prolonged, a dietary similar to 
the following, which is prescribed by Fiessinger, should be given: 

Breakfast and Tea. — Twelve ounces of milk and 2 ounces oi saltless 
bread. 

Midday. — Six ounces of meat without salt, | pound of vegetables cooked 
without salt, or the same amount of fresh fruit, 2h ounces of saltless bread, 
and a tumblerful of water, or with 3 ounces of claret. The meat may be 
boiled with vegetables, which give flavour to it. 

Dinner. — Milk soup, thickened with cornflour, etc., 2 ounces of bread, a 
couple of eggs, and water to drink. 

On one or two daj-s a week the diet should consist of milk alone. Too 
much liquid should not be allowed during the treatment, as it would increase 
the plethora, add to the burden of the heart, increase weight of the body, 
cause dyspnoea, and a sense of oppression. B3' keeping the consumption of 
liquids low, we may obtain a freer flow of urine. A small amount of salt may 
be allowed as the symptoms improve, but the urine should be examined 
frequenth', and a constant lookout kept for oedema, increase of weight, 
oppression, and dyspnoea, which may necessitate the withdrawal of the salt 
and return to a milk diet. 

Toxic Nephritis. — When nephritis occurs in a course of mercurial 
treatment, the remedy must be stopped, the patient ordered to 
rest in bed, and have a milk diet for eight days. Should there be 
no reduction of albuminuria at the end of that time, Siredey recom- 
mends, in s}q3hilis, that specific treatment be resumed; but if the 
albuminuria becomes more marked under treatment, it must be 
discontinued again, and the milk and rest resumed. Nephritis 
occurring from phosphorus-poisoning should be treated by an 
emetic to remove any metal from the stomach, followed by a water 
or milk and water diet for a few days, ^^'hen it is due to arsenic, 
the diet should consist of milk and water with calcined magnesia. 
When it is due to cantharides, the ordinary treatment of acute 
nephritis is required. 

During pregnancy albuminuria may be due to some infectious 
diseases or toxfemia. The latter arises, according to Fiessinger, 
from failure of the liver- — Iiepato-toxremia. In both cases a milk diet 
is essential. Should oedema arise, it may be necessary to confine 
the patient to water diet for a few days, folIoM'ed bj^ milk and 
water diet, and finalty pure milk diet. This method yields excellent 
results. The milk may be given raw, boiled, or baked, and cold 
or warm. It is often disliked, but toleration will soon be established, 
and the dose can be gradualfy increased. After about four days it 
is usually found that the urine increases and albumin diminishes; 
and the diet may be that for ordinary nephritis. If the albumin 



TOXIC NEPHRITIS 413 

dot'^ not (liiniiiish, the patient must be kept on nulk, larinaciuus 
foods, and fruit tor the rest of tlie pregnancy. Ihe urine should be 
examined once a week. Due attention nmst be paid to the bowels 
and skin, and symptoms of luemorrhage or abortion must be 
looked for. 

The treatment oi uraemia in persons of all ages should be begun 
by a water-diet until the convulsive stage is passed and coma no 
longer threatens him. Water may be given in the ordinary way; 
but if the patient is unconscious, it should be injected at about 
blood heat into the colon through a long rubber tube, in doses of 
I pint every three hours. In bad cases the injection of cold water 
has a greater diuretic effect. At the same time diaphoresis should 
be promoted by warm blankets and hot-air baths. 

\\'hen consciousness returns, the patient should be allowed plenty 
of water and its variants — oatmeal-water, barle^'-water, aerated 
waters, etc. — and about i pint of milk in divided doses. As im- 
provement occurs, the milk may be increased, farinaceous foods 
added, and a dietary built up gradually, as in cases of acute 
nephritis. 

Chronic Blight's Disease. 

Numerous observations on the metabolism of nitrogen in renal 
diseases have been made. Baginsky found that the kidneys do not 
excrete nitrogen so well as in health, and it is chiefly excreted in 
the form of urea. Kornblum considered that there was no diminu- 
tion in the excretion of nitrogen in chronic Bright's disease, but that 
the metabolism of nitrogen was much retarded. On the other hand, 
Mann fomid that in every case of chronic nephritis, sclerosis, and 
amyloid disease of the kidneys, the output of nitrogen was less than 
the income, and nitrogen was retained in the body, ^'on Noorden 
found that urea and creatinin are excreted with difficulty in par- 
enchymatous nephritis, but the purin bodies — uric acid, xanthin, 
hypo.xanthin. and guanin — ^and ammonia are well excreted. The 
conclusion to be drawn from these observations is that nitrogen 
equilibrium can only be maintained when a small amount of 
nitrogen is consmiied; and if nitrogen is consumed above that limit, 
there may be a considerable retention of nitrogen, which is stored 
in the oedematous tissues, and tends to cause unemia. If the 
nitrogen consumed is again lowered, the proportion of the outgo 
to the income increases mitil equilibrium is reached. The metabolism 
and excretion of nitrogen is therefore much retarded. Some 
examples of diets, with a comparison of the income and outgo of 
nitrogen, will ilhisirate this point (see table, p. 414). 

The Diet in Bright's Disease. — These observations show that in 
most cases of renal disease nitrogen is retained in the body when 
more than 10 or 11 grammes — i.e., 63 to 68 grains — of protein are 
consumed daily, and that the retention of nitrogen occurs even when 
the flow of urine is abundant. As a rule the more pronounced the

dropsy the greater is tlie retention ol nitrogen. The rules that we 
can draw from these observations are these : 

1. The diet must be sujjlcicnt in oiergy-producing value to main- 
tain the body in a fail' state of nutrition. The total quantity of 
food allowed must depend on the amount of fat in the body. 
Obesity is a bad complication of Bright 's disease. But there are 
many cases where the nutrition has already suffered. In such 
cases the food must be sufficient to improve the nutrition and 
increase strength. On the other hand, if the body is heavy and 
fat, we must endeavour to reduce it by slovv degrees, and care must 
be taken when we reduce the weight that, at the same time, we do 
not reduce strength. The energy value of the food should therefore 
not be reduced below 2,000 to 2,200 calories. It is important that 
the weight of the body be watched, and a record kept of its varia- 
tions. Changes in the quantity of water in the tissues naturally 
cause a variation in the weight. A sudden increase of weight is more 
likely to be due to dropsy than to an increase of tissues; and a sudden 
drop in weight is equally likely to be due to subsidence of the dropsy. 

2. The amount of nitrogen should be within the limits of the 
excretory power. Nitrogen is assimilated fairly well, but its excre- 
tion is "extremely slow; and the consumption of protein above the 
excretory hmit leads to the retention of nitrogenous waste materials 
and increase of dropsy. The metabolism of protein and excretion 
of waste materials throws more work on the body than an isodyna- 
mic quantity of fat and carbohydrate. The average amount of 
nitrogen excreted through the kidneys daily by these people is 
somewhere about 10 or 11 grammes, and this would be derived 
from 66 to 76 grammes of digested, or 80 to 85 grammes of un- 
digested, protein. It is therefore advisable to reduce the intake 
of protein to the lowest limit which is a safe allowance, and thus 
spare the kidneys and avoid the accumulation not only of nitrog- 
enous waste products, but of the inorganic waste materials arising 
from protein foods. 

3. There is no difference in the effects of various kinds of protein 
on the nitrogen excretion. It matters little, therefore, whether the 
source of protein be the animal or vegetable kingdom — meat, fowl, 
fish, milk, cereals, or legumes, (i) .4s regards albuminuria, the 
observations of Pettenkofer and Voit tend to show that in Bright 's 
disease nitrogenous foods do not increase the albuminuria, and 
any increase is due to a personal factor. Herringham^ says: " I 
have repeatedly estimated the daily amount of albumin excreted 
under various diets in order to show my students that a change 
from milk to fish, from fish to poultry or butchers' meat, does not 
increase albuminuria. ... I do not believe there is any good reason 
for restricting the patient to fish or poultry, and still less to milk 
and vegetable proteins." 

(2) As regards the nitrogenous extractives, it was formerly believed 
that the patient should only take white-fleshed foods — milk and 

1 Brit. Med. Jour., 1910, ii. 1-5. 



4t6 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

fish, or fish and poultry — and not red meat. This was due to a 
misunderstanding as regards the amount of extractives contained 
in these foods. Klemperer preferred his patients to have fish rather 
than meat, while Bouchard forbade fish on the ground that it con- 
tains toxins and increases the toxicity of the blood and urine. 
Pel said we must distinguish between the kinds of fish, but there 
is no need to exclude light and easily digested kinds. Red or dark 
meat was considered more harmful than the white flesh of chicken, 
pheasant, turkey, or rabbit. Game generally was condemned. 
jBut nobody explained why butchers' meat, venison, hare, par- 
tridge, quail, and other wild birds, are more harmful to the kidneys 
than fish or chicken, except that they belonged to dark-fleshed 
animals. Indeed, within the last few years it has been shown that 
the distinction between light and dark flesh, as far as the kidneys 
are concerned, is a myth. The dift'erence was supposed to be due 
to a greater amount of extractives or meat bases in the dark-coloured 
varieties of flesh. But this assumption was incorrect. Von 
Noorden proved that the amount of extractives in red and white 
meat is about the same, the excess being in white flesh, but so small 
as to be negligible. From this circumstance he concluded that 
white flesh is no more suitable than dark flesh, but if one is allowed, 
the other may be allowed. The assimilation and excretion of food 
in chronic nephritis was studied by Von Noorden. He used a 
mixed diet in his experiments, including milk and eggs. The con- 
clusions he drew from these observations w^ere — (i) That the nutrients 
excreted in the faces difters in no respect from those in health, and 
therefore the absorption and assimilation of food is normal ; but the 
metabolism i-- not normal; (2) that the form in which proteins were 
consumed (meat, milk, eggs, or vegetables) had no influence on the 
action of the kidneys. Other observers have also sho\Nn that there 
is no fundamental reason for the distinction drawn between light 
and dark meat. Prior experimented with eggs, and found that 
cooked eggs did not increase the albuminuria, and raw eggs, when 
consumed in reasonable amount with other food, did not cause 
albuminuria in healthy subjects, nor increase it in albuminuric sub- 
jects. On the other ha^nd, w-hen raw eggs were consumed alone 
(say ten to fourteen eggs a day), they did cause albuminuria in 
healthy subjects, and they increased the albuminuria in nephritic 
subjects. 

The influence of vegetable, animal, and mixed foods was studied 
by Zasiadko of St. Petersburg in ten patients suffering from chronic 
nephritis. Each patient was put on a vegetable diet for ten days, 
then on animal diet with some bread for ten days, and finally on 
mixed diet for ten days, and the following conclusions were drawn : 

I. Vegetarian Diet. — The daily amount of albumin in the urine 
markedly decreased, the arterial tension sank, the pulse became 
slower, weaker, and more easily compressible; bid the dropsy in- 
creased considerably, the general condition grew worse, the patient 
became weaker, apathetic, etc. 



CHRONIC NEPIIh'lTIS 417 

2. Animal food, with sonic bread: The daily quantity of albumin 
in the urine increased markedly, the arterial tension rose, the pulse 
became feebler and more frequent; but the daily amount of urine 
and the proportion of solids and specilic gravity increased. The 
dropsy diminished , and the weight of the body decreased pari passu 
with the dropsy; the patient became stronger, more cheerful, and 
the general condition improved. 

3. Mixed diet stood midway in its effects, but came nearer to 
animal food in its influence on the daily amount of albumin. 

4. Mixed diet is the best for chronic Bright's disease, but in chronic 
parenchymatous nephritis, with profuse albuminuria, vegetable foods 
and milk should be in relative excess; while in interstitial nephritis, 
with general weakness, the animal food should preponderate over 
the vegetable food. 

Offer and Rosingvist^ recorded observations bearing out the 
conclusions of Von Noorden. Senator^ maintained the opinion that 
dark meat is more injurious than hght meat, and considered the 
view held by Offer and Rosingvist to be erroneous. He says they 
speak of extractive matters generally, but neglect to distinguish 
between nitrogenous and non-azotized extractives. Moreover, he 
saj's that no account was taken of the fact that meat is usually 
cooked before it is eaten, and that cooking alters the proportion. 
He quotes Konig, who states that as regards beef and veal the pro- 
portions are as follows : 

Extractives in Beef and Veal {per Cent.): Raw beef, 0-46; roast 
beef, 072; boiled beef, 0-42; raw veal, 0-07; roast veal, 0-03. These 
figures led him to conclude that the paler sorts of flesh, and especi- 
ally the flesh of young animals, is poorer in extractive matter, and 
that this conclusion has not been disproved. But Senator evidently 
overlooks the fact that there is more nucleo-protein in the flesh of 
young animals, and that this is split up into purin bodies during 
digestion (see Purin Bodies in Foods, p. 226). 

It behoves us to spare the diseased organs all superfluous work, 
and keep from them those stimuli which are capable of damaging 
their structure. Von Noorden found: (i) In ordinary cases of 
Bright's disease the elimination is usually good, but it varies with 
regard to certain things, and these variations are unfavourable to 
the elimination of urea (if the food produces more than 30 grammes), 
uric acid, inorganic salts, water, lead, iron, arsenic, bromine, iodine, 
boron, and alkaloids. (2) In acute exacerbations and in the terminal 
stages of Bright's disease the same conditions obtain as in acute 
Bright's disease — viz., there is imperfect ehmination of urea, 
creatinin, hippuric acid, phosphates, sulphates, colouring matters, 
and water, although the uric acid, xanthin bases, amino-acids, 
carbonates, and chlorides are not eliminated with greater difficulty 
than prior to the acute attack. It is therefore an important duty 
to keep from the patient all articles of diet containing metabolic 
products, which irritate the kidneys and are eliminated with diffi-

4i8 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

culty. For that purpose it is necessary to study the urine, to find 
out how the course of the disease is influenced by diet, to ascertain 
whether the kidneys are duly excreting the products of metabolism, 
and whether the food increases the tube-casts and albuminuria. 

1. To find oiit how nnich protein may he prescribed, one should 
estimate the amount of nitrogen excreted by the patient when his 
condition is considered to be good. After many observations of 
cases of Bright's disease Von Noorden found that men of average 
weight excrete from 13 to 16 grammes, and women from ii to I4 
grammes of nitrogen daily. This output is equivalent to the 
metabolism of 92 to 112 grammes of protein by men, and 80 to 100 
grammes by women. If the consumption of protein was increased 
so as to be equal to 15 grammes of nitrogen, the elimination became 
slow and irregular. It may therefore be considered a settled point 
that C)5 grammes of protein should be the upper limit of consump- 
tion by a person with chronic Bright's disease, even when his kidneys 
are well compensated, the general condition good, and the strength 
maintained. But the upper limit cannot be reached by ever\'body, 
and it would be useless to try and force the kidneys to eliminate 
more waste nitrogenous materials than they possibly can do. 
Therefore is it strongly recommended that the nitrogen elimination 
be closely watched. The twenty-four hours urine should be col- 
lected, the total nitrogen, urea, and percentage of albumin ascer- 
tained and recorded, together with the patient's weight. The 
patient should then be placed upon an experimental diet for three 
days, after which the total nitrogen, urea, albumin, and weight 
should be again recorded. The diet is then adjusted to the excretion, 
and after another space of three days the observations are again 
made and recorded, until a dietar\' is arrived at which agrees with 
the patient, and the nitrogen in the food and excretions balance. 
If an acute exacerbation occurs, the amount of protein in the food 
should be temporarily reduced. But in the ordinary course of the 
case the protein allowance should be moderate, neither too low nor 
too high. The upper limit has been fixed at 95 grammes of 
protein daily, and we should also have a lower limit. The lowest 
physiological limit for the average individual has been discussed in 
the chapter on the Normal Protein Requirement. Those remarks 
need not be repeated. But I do not think it is advisable to reduce 
the allowance of protein below 63 grammes daily in any case, and 
this amount" should 'give rise to the excretion of 10 grammes of 
nitrogen. 

2. To find Old the kind of protein which should be allowed obser- 
vations must be made of the effects of various foods on the albumi- 
nuria and the excretion of uric acid and purin bases. It is recog- 
nized that the same diet will not suit every case. Some articles 
increase or decrease the albuminuria. As a general rule, milk for a 
short time causes an increase, but later on a decrease, of the albumin 
in the urine. An exclusive milk diet diminishes albuminuria less 
than a vegetarian diet, and a meat diet increases it as a rule, although 



ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIET 419 

it may lead to a reduction of tlie albuminuria in some cases. C)n 
the whole, a mixed diet gives the most satisfactory result. But it 
is bettor to test the patient with the various articles individually. 
Robin/ at the International Medical Congress, 1900, described his 
method of discovering the diet most suitable for the patient. 
Firstly, he begins by giving a milk diet only, the result being an 
immediate increase of albuminuria, which gradually diminishes and 
becomes stationary. Secondly, at this stage vegetables are added 
to the diet. A new oscillation in the albuminuria is caused thereby, 
but it soon settles down, and usually results in the albuminuria 
being still further reduced. Thirdly, meat is cautiously added. 
In this way he found it is possible to determine whether milk alone, 
milk and vegetables, or meat, milk, and vegetables, caused the 
greatest reduction in albuminuria. Each food can be tested as 
regards its effects on the albumin, and those which are deleterious 
can be eliminated from the diet. It was by this method that Robin 
arrived at the conclusion that bread never increases albuminuria; 
wine causes a slight increase; beef and veal are to be recom- 
mended more than mutton or fowl, and fish should be forbidden. 
The effect of red and white meat has already been discussed, and it 
has been shown that the ancient dogma about red meat containing 
more extractives than white meat is erroneous; on the other hand, 
fowl and rabbit sometimes contain more extractives than beef, but 
the difference is so trifling that it is absolutely of no consequence 
whether the patient eats red or white meat, and. putting aside the 
patient's pecuharities, which Robin suggests should be discovered by 
the above means, it does not matter whether the albumin is derived 
from meat, fish, eggs, milk, and vegetables. 

The diseased kidneys do not always eliminate uric acid and other 
purin bodies well, especially when the quantity consumed is large; 
but Von Xoorden found, as a general rule, the kidneys are able to 
ehminate quantities of uric acid up to 0-75 gramme (10 or 12 grains). 
This quantity is readily and steadily ehminated daily by nephritics, 
and this is the amount normally excreted by a man on an ordinary 
diet. But the uric acid would be easily increased in amount if we 
allowed the patient to consume sweetbreads, brains, liver, kidneys, 
and other glandular organs rich in nuclein and nucleo-proteins. If 
these foods are forbidden, and the amount of protein from meat, 
fish, eggs, milk, etc., does not exceed the limit named above, the 
quantity of uric acid to be eliminated will not exceed 075 gramme 
daily. 

3. How much fluid should he allowed ? This depends on the 
amount of urine excreted, the existence and extent of oedema, and 
the condition of the organs of circulation. In acute nephritis we 
have to do with kidneys which are blocked up and unable to excrete 
water; there is not merely a retention of water in the tissues, but 
also of the waste products of metabohsm. In chronic parenchy- 
matous nephritis, and granular kidney without dropsy, the kidney 

^ Brit. Med. Jour., 1900, ii., epitome 157. 



420 DTSn.lSES OF TIIF URINARY SVSTFM 

is able to excrete water. Therefore the consumption of water must 
be looked upon as having a diuretic and antiursemic effect. For 
this reason it was formerl}' taught that the patient should drink a 
large quantity' of fluids, the intake being governed b}' the output. 
There is some danger, however, of the patient taking an excess of 
fluids, and if the water is not excreted, it simply increases the oedema 
and the hydremia. The position with regard to the consumption of 
fluids has changed somewhat, because we know that there are other 
problems to face than that of ridding the system of effete materials, 
desirable as this result may be. Everj' patient with chronic Bright's 
disease is suffering from changes in the heart and vessels. In many 
cases the heart trouble is more dangerous than the kidney disease. 
If in these cases we overload the system with water, a heart which 
is compensated may become dilated and feeble. So long as the 
nutrition is good, the increased blood-pressure due to the disease is 
met by compensatory hypertrophy. But a continued strain, arising 
from an overloaded circulation, may precipitate the failure of com- 
pensation, associated with attacks of cardiac pain, irregularity of 
the pulse or arrhythmia, and cardiac dropsy. Consequently the 
effects of the consurnption of liquids must be watched. 

In cases of failure of the cardiac compensation Von Xoorden 
recommends the rule of Oertel for heart cases should be followed 
— viz., never to allow the patient to take more than i^ Htres 
(52 ounces) of fluids daily. Assuming that the solid and semisoHd 
foods taken during the day contain 17 to 25 ounces of water, 
the amount of urine under this regime should be 46 to 52 ounces 
a day. 

The influence of this restriction of fluid must be watched. It may 
be the means of producing a betterment of the general condition. 
But this does not alwaj-s follow. It may cause a diminution in the 
urinary excretion. If the amount of urine sinks, the percentage of 
albumin wiU probably be slightly increased. Von Noorden does 
not shrink from curtailing the intake of fluid; he believes the 
advantages derived thereby are greater than the disadvantages. 
If, however, it is found that the curtailment of liquids has an adverse 
influence on the excretion of urea, uric acid, and salts, the reduction 
of liquids must be discontinued at once, in spite of the beneficial 
effect of restriction on the heart, circulation, and dropsy. The 
retention of poisonous waste products is fraught with dangers which 
must be avoided. In such cases Von Noorden recommends the 
amount of fluids " be alternately increased and reduced. The con- 
sumption of liquids should never be less than i^ lities (2 pints) 
daily, and once a week the system should be flushed by giving 
2^ to 3 litres (4 to 5 pints), adding for gouty cases small doses of 
sodium bicarbonate." 

A consideration of the foregoing shows that, while we cannot 
restore health to parts of the kidneys which have become diseased, 
we can do a good deal to prevent them getting worse, to prevent 
other portions from getting aflected in the same way, to improve 



DIET FOR CASES WITHOUT DROPSY 421 

symptoms that already result from the disease, and establish com- 
pensation. Our efforts at treatment will always be handicapped 
by our ignorance of the cause, but if the cause is recognizable and 
can be removed — e.g., alcoholism or plumbism — we may do more for 
the patient than when the cause is irremovable. But unfortunately 
our guesses at the cause are often beside the mark or shots at random. 
The disease may be due to some indiscoverable chronic infection 
or disturbance of metabolism. We are therefore not able in many 
cases to work from the point of view of the cause, and are driven 
to general principles. " Such people," says Herringham, " are hke 
a town in which part of the drainage system has been put out of order. 
They are unable to cope with the same amount of solid and liquid 
excreta as before. Therefore they must be regarded as permanently 
on a lower plane. They can no longer overeat and overdrink them- 
selves as other people do. They must spare their kidneys." The 
quantity of food and drink considered advisable has been fully 
discussed above. The patient must take less than the average 
individual. Without arguing that half rations are better for 
healthy people than the usual amount, we know that people can live 
and maintain their nitrogen balance in equilibrium on about half 
the amount of proteins prescribed by physiologists, health and 
weight being maintained. We know that individuals who do no 
active muscular work require only about half as much energy as 
those who do laborious work, and therefore the calorie value of the 
food should be little more than 2,000 calories a day. It should be 
again observed that any change from milk to fish, or fish to meat, 
and even a change in the opposite direction, will probably be followed 
by a temporar}^ disturbance of the albuminuria, and an increase 
in the amount of albumin for a day or two. But it quickly falls 
again, there being no permanent increase with the change from one 
form of protein to the other. Of course, no estimations of albumin 
are of any value unless made from the twenty-four hours' total 
urine. Tlie dietary may be divided into that for cases without 
dropsy and those with dropsy. 

I. Dietary for Cases without Dropsy.— The diet should be light, 
nourishing, easily digested, unirritating, but not free from cellulose. 
It should contain from 60 to 75 grammes of protein, and yield 
2,000 to 2,500 calories according to the occupation followed by the 
patient. 

As a general rule the patient may have meat, fowl, or lish, uncf 
a day, usually in the middle of the day, and the amount should not 
exceed 3 or 4 ounces. An egg, or egg and bacon, or a fillet of plaice, 
may be taken at breakfast-time. It is advisable that one-half the 
protein should be derived from animal foods, and therefore it will 
be necessary to add some milk to the diet. One pint of whole milk 
and 3 ounces of cooked meat will contain about 40 grammes of 
protein, and that should be the hmit of animal food. If 4 ounces 
of meat, fish, or fowl be taken, the milk should not exceed | pint. 
If there is any evidence of considerable irritation in the kidneys, the 



422 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

allowance of meat, fish, or fowl, must be reduced to 2, or even i^, 
ounces daily, the milk being correspondingly increased. In some 
cases it may be necessary- to allow solid animal food only two or 
three times a week, milk being given to replace it. But it must 
never be forgotten that the protein, whatever its source, has to be 
converted into urea, and there is no evidence that urea from one 
source is excreted more easily than from another. 

The following diets would contain from 64 to 78 grammes of 
protein and 2,000 to 2,200 calories, of which about 92 per cent, 
would be digested: 

1. Cooked fish, 3 ounces; bread, 6 ounces; butter, i ounce; tea; 
sugar, I ounce; cream, 2 ounces; marmalade; beef, cooked and free 
from bone, 3 ounces; cooked potatoes, 3^ ounces; cooked green 
peas. 2 ounces; rice pudding, 3 ounces; bananas, 3^ ounces. Total 
protein, 78 grammes; energy, 2,020 calories. 

2. Oaimeal, i ounce; milk, J pint; bread, 6 ounces; butter, 

1 ounce; one egg; tea; sugar, i ounce; cooked fowl, 2 ounces; 
potato, 3| ounces; cauhflower, 3^ ounces; tomato; tapioca pudding, 

2 ounces; apples, 3I ounces; cream, 2 ounces. Total protein, 
76 grammes; energy, 2,035 calories. 

3. Fat smoked bacon, i ounce; one egg; bread, 6 ounces; butter, 
i^ ounces; tea; sugar, i ounce; cream, i ounce; tripe, 4 ounces; 
boiled onions, 3 J ounces: potato, 3^ ounces; custard (containing one 
egg, 6 ounces of milk, ^ ounce of sugar); stewed prunes, 2 ounces; 
watercress, lettuce, or other salad. Total protein, 66 grammes; 
energy, 2,100 calories. 

4. Oatmeal, i ounce; milk, | pint; bread, 4 ounces; butter, 
I ounce; tea or coffee; cream, i ounce; marmalade or jam; lettuce, 
watercress, etc. ; mutton, 3 ounces of leg or shoulder free from bone ; 
potato, 3| ounces; kidney or string beans, 3| ounces; tapioca 
pudding, 2 ounces; sugar, i^ ounces; fresh fruit — apples, pears, etc., 
16 ounces. Total protein, 64 grammes; energ}-, 2,000 calories. 

The alimentary organs must be duly considered. All those 
dietetic articles detailed "to be avoided " in the treatment of 
indigestion or chronic gastric catarrh and liver complaints, should 
be avoided in chronic nephritis. If, under the influence of the 
dietary chosen, it is found that the urinary solids are of a proper 
character and composition, the density of the urine is satisfactory, 
the albumin diminishes, and the general condition ^f the patient 
improves, we may conclude that the diet agrees with the patient. 
If, on the other hand, the general condition is not maintained, but 
the arterial tension increases, and the density of the urine is not 
satisfactory, even though the amount of urine remains the same, 
it is probable that there is some error in the diet which must be 
rectified. There can be no greater error than to allow strong broths, 
soups, meat extracts, meat «^ssences, meat juices, or meat powders, 
which are rich in creatin, or substances like sweetbread, spleen, 
liver, kidney, brain, oysters, mussels, crab, of lobster, because these 
are particularly rich in nuclein bodies and other nitrogenous 



VECFTARIAN DIET 



423 



products, which speedily become transformed into urea, uric acid, 
or other purin bodies, which have to be excreted. Not only are such 
foods dangerous on account of the defective elimination of waste 
materials, but to such people they are positively poisonous, and 
tend to aggravate the disease. The kidneys are irritated thereby, 
and the accumulated materials intensify the risk of ur?emia. It is 
also possible that animal food of any kind does not agree with the 
patient, and a vegetarian diet is necessary. 

Vegetarian Diet in Bright's Disease. — Observations have pre- 
vioush- been ni;ide on the efferts of vegetarian food, animal food, 
and mixed diet on the albuminuria and general condition. This 
matter need not have been referred to again except for the reason 
that a vegetarian diet has for some years been prescribed by various 
people as a treatment for the disease. Vaughan^ of Michigan 
University believes that Bright's disease is due to a toxicity of the 
blood-serum exerting a specific action on the secretory cells of the 
kidneys, and the object of his treatment is to profoundly alter the 
proteins of the blood, and through it act beneficially on the kidneys. 
He forbids all animal food. The diet prescribed by him consists of 
bread, cereals, legumes, potatoes, green vegetables, fresh fruit, 
sugar, and zwiebach — a kind of " pulled bread " — cream, butter 
and cheese. 

The following is a sample dietary prescribed by him:

Vaughan takes no account of tlie fresh fruit and vegetables con- 
sumed by the patient, and apparently allows them ad libitum. He 
claims that after a few weeks of such diet the patient loses his desire 
for meat and cgs; a hard-working man can hve upon it with ease, 
and the albuminuria diminishes. The reduction of albumin in the 
urine corresponds with that found by other authorities; but it 
should be observed that while the diet causes a decrease of albumin 
and arterial tension, there may be an increase of oedema. There is 
no more difficulty about such people living on a vegetarian diet 
than normal individuals. But it is questionable whether it is 
possible, as Vaughan claims, " to profoundly alter the proteins 
of the blood." According to modem theories, all the proteins of 

* North-Western Medicine, September, 1903. 



424 DISEASES OF THE URTNARY SYSTEM 

our food are broken down into amino-acids in the alimentary canal, 
and the proteins of the blood (which are always of the same kind 
and composition) are reconstructed out of such amino-acids. 
Vaughan's argument therefore falls to the ground. The chief value 
of vegetarian food is that it is a low protein diet, containing less 
extractives and purin bases than ordinary mixed diet. Unfortu- 
nately the dietary by Vaughan takes no account of the fruit and 
vegetables consumed, and the record of the total protein is not 
exact. The amount stated (only 39 grammes of protein) is peril- 
ously low, and it is very probable that a patient would not long 
remain " lit " and able to perform his daily task on such a low 
protein diet. We have previously fixed the amount of protein for 
a renal patient as something between 65 and 76 grammes daily. 
Considering that vegetables are not so well and easily digested as 
animal foods, the intake ought not to be less than 76 grammes of 
protein when it is wholly derived from the vegetable kingdom. 
If the phj^sician desires to trj- a vegetarian diet, the following 
examples ma}^ be useful : 

1. Bread, 12 ounces; butter, i| ounces; dried beans, 3^ ounces; 
white sauce, 2 ounces ; potatoes (cooked), 3^ ounces ; cream, 2 ounces ; 
rice pudding, 2 ounces; sugar, i| ounces; tea. Total protein, 
82 grammes; energy, 2,714 calories. 

2. Bread, 8 ounces; butter, i^ ounces; tea; sugar, 2 ounces; 
dried peas, 3^ ounces; white sauce, 2 ounces; oatmeal, 2 ounces; 
cream, 5 ounces; apples; pears; grapes. Total protein, 80 grammes; 
energ}^ 2,345 calories. 

3. Bread, 6 ounces; butter, i ounce; sugar, ij ounces; lentils, 
2 ounces (for vegetable soup); potatoes (cooked), 3^ ounces; 
cauliflower (cooked), 3^ ounces; roasted peanuts, 4 ounces; raw 
apples, 7 ounces. Total protein, 76 grammes; energy, 1,988 
calories. 

3. Almonds, 2 ounces; dried raisins, 2 ounces; bananas, 7 ounces; 
bread, 12 ounces; butter, i| ounces; cream (for tea), i ounce; 
tapioca pudding, 2 ounces ; milk, ^ pint . Total protein, 80 grammes ; 
energy, 2,700 calories. 

5. Oatmeal, i ounce; milk, 5 ounces; bread, 6 ounces; butter, 
2 ounces; sugar, i ounce; cream, i ounce; tomatoes, 4 ounces; 
grapes, i pound; Brazil nuts, 4 ounces. Total protein, 86 grammes; 
energy, 3,074 calories. 

6. Oranges, i| pounds; filbert nuts, 2 ounces; dates, 4 ounces; 
dried Navy beans, 3^ ounces; white sauce, 2 ounces; tomatoes, 
2 ounces; bread, 6 ounces; butter, i^ ounces; cream, i ounce; milk, 
^ pint. Total protein, 76 grammes; energy, 2,630 calories. 

Beverages.— The total amount of fluid to be allowed has already 
been discussed. It remains to consider what kinds of liquids ma}' 
be taken. Pure water is always permissible up to the Hmit of liquids 
allowable. But ver\' few people are satisfied with pure water; 
they want it flavoured. The waters containing carbonic acid gas 
and weak alkaline or saline waters are recommended, especially 



[nnVHRAGES 425 

those of ApolliiKuis, Perrier, Vals, Vichy, Ems, Kisscngcn, Wies- 
baden, Bihn, Carlsbad, Saratoga- Vichy, Hot Springs (Arkansas), 
Harr()gat(\ Leamington, Tunbridge Wells, Malvern, Contrexeville 
Homburg, and Wildungen. 

Tea, coffee, cocoa, kola, guarana, and other substances of a like 
character can be taken in strict moderation; the quantity must be 
limited, because these substances contain a relatively large amount 
of purins. Coffee contains 0-2 gramme per cent, of purins, and 
causes an excretion of 0-075 gramme of purins. Some interesting 
experiments shownng the effects on the kidneys of the continued use 
of caffein were carried out by Tomasetti.^ The animals used were 
rabbits. A dose of i centigramme of caffein'J'per^ kilo of body- 
weight was administered for thirty or forty days, and it caused 
changes in the cells of the convoluted tubules of the kidneys. A 
daily dose of as little as ^ centigramme of caffein for sixty days 
caused changes in the cells of the tubules, and produced distinct 
vascular and interstitial alterations. Caffein increases the blood- 
pressure, and is cumulative in its effects. Zenetz^ found that when 
patients were given 20 to 30 centigrammes (3 to 4^ grains) of caffein 
two or three times a day, it produced^a rise in blood- pressure and 
some increase of urine, but did not markedly decrease the oedema. 
If this amount of caffein were consumed for four or six days, the 
patient experienced a sensation of constriction in the chest, dyspncea 
and insomnia, as a result of increased blood- pressure. The toxic 
dose varies in different individuals. Caffein continues to be excreted 
in the urine for ten to fifteen days after the last dose, which proves 
not only that it accumulates in the body, but it is excreted very 
slowlv, and should not be given in artcrio-sclerosis, cardiac and 
renal diseases. One ounce of tea or coffee contains ^ gramme of 
caffein; therefore tea is better than coffee because less is used. 
Cocoa is less injurious than either; its active principle, theobromin, 
being frequently prescribed as a remedy in Bright's disease, especially 
in granular contracted kidney. 

Alcohol is better withheld, and can only be allowed in ver^^ small 
amounts. It is nearly alwavs injurious by increasing arterial 
tension and quickening the heart. When small quantities are 
consumed, all but 5 per cent, is fully oxidized in the body. But an 
excessive consumption of alcohol may have been the primar}^ 
cause of the renal disease by its local influence. In such a case the 
patient must have habitually consumed more than 2 ounces of 
alcohol daily. People a<jcustomed to take much alcohol will not 
as a rule consent to total abstinence, and therefore we must do our 
best to keep the consumption down to 2 ounces, which is equal to 
4 ounces of good whisky or Holland gin, or ^ pint of light wine. 
Spirits should be well diluted. But there is another class of patients 
who have probably never been " drinkers." Some of these might 
be benefited by a wineglassful of good generous wine or h ounce of

425 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

pure malt whisky twice a day. Hale White^ says: " If the heart is 
feeble and the arterial tension is low, a small quantity of alcohol may 
do good, as it also may if the digestion is weak or the patient cannot 
sleep." A moderate amount of good claret or Burgundy will assist 
in restoring the cardiac energy and improving nutrition, which are 
objects requiring considerable attention in the dietetic treatment. 
Warrington^ also says: " Alcohol is to be forbidden in general. 
But its transitory use is indicated when there is a lack of appetite 
and disturbance of the heart. A small amount of champagne in 
the evening may prevent the nightly attacks of uraemia and cardiac 
asthma; but it should be forbidden as a table beverage; it threatens 
the heart and the walls of the bloodvessels." 

Tobacco ought to be taboo; there is no doubt that it increases 
the arterial tension, and is injurious in all renal diseases. 

2. The Dietary in Cases of Dropsy. — The diets which have been 
prescribed for renal disease with dropsy are milk diet, partial 
milk diet, mixed diet, dry diet, and salt-free diet. The special 
objects of treatment are to unload the lymphatics, to establish a 
circulation from the bloodvessels to the lymphatics, and quicken 
the lymphatic circulation by position, passive movements, and 
massage. 

Milk Diet.— This diet would cause an abundant flow of urine, 
even when there is a tendency to suppression. When strictly 
carried out, it includes the consumption of 3^ to 5^ pints of milk. 
The lower limit is fixed by the expenditure of the body during 
absolute rest in bed — viz., 1,400 calories. The upper limit (5j pints) 
would yield 2,050 calories and contain no to 115 grammes of pro- 
tein, and is fixed by the amount of hquid which the body is capable 
of dealing with. In many cases the kidneys cannot excrete 
5j pints of urine daily, and the upper limit must then be fixed by 
the ability of the kidneys to deal with it, due allowance being 
made for excretion by the skin and lungs. The advantages of 
milk diet in dropsy are — (i) Its freedom from purins and other 
substances calculated to irritate the kidneys; (2) the digestibility 
of its albumin ; (3) the diuretic action of the lactose; (4) the ameliora- 
tion of the general symptoms which follows its use; and (5) the loss 
of albumin is made up by milk. It is not necessary that the milk 
should be taken plain; it may be flavoured with celery salt, or 
boiled \\ith the green tops of celery, made into soup with vege- 
tables, milk-tea, cocoa made with milk, milk jelly made with 
isinglass, junket, sour milk, koumiss, kephir, etc. 

Ihe disadvantages of exclusive milk diet are — (i) Too much 
albumin; (2) too much water; (3) too much phosphoric acid; and 
(4) too little iron. The amount of protein in 5J pints of milk is 
above the limit considered advisable for renal patients; it would 
yield 38 grammes of urea, which is more than the average excreted 
by a man doing ordinary work. If the protein is not excreted, it 
is retained in the body in the form of floating protein or urea. 

^ Drii. Med. Jour., 1904, ii. 886-890. 2 Practitioner, 1909, p. 162. 



1)1 irr ran cases with dropsy 427 

Ihe deficiency in iron could be made good by medicines. The 
amount of phosphoric acid in 3 htrcs of milk varies from 3 to 
4 grammes; this is considered to be excessive and injurious in 
chronic renal diseases. Von Xoorden eliminates the phosphoric acid 
by adding lime-water to the milk. In this way it is converted into 
an insoluble phosphate of lime, which is excreted by the bowels; 
but the addition of lime-water increases the quantity of liquid and 
increases the disadvantage. 

The indications for milk diet in chronic renal disease are an 
acute exacerbation or subacute attack of nephritis, the existence of 
oedema, uraemia, or symptoms, pointing to renal or cardiac inade- 
quacy. The absence of cedema contra-indicates the use of milk 
diet; neither should it be prescribed in compensated renal sclerosis, 
amyloid kidney, tubercular nephritis, residual, orthostatic, or 
cyclical albuminuria. 

There can be no doubt as to the diuretic effect of milk, koumiss, 
or kephir. During treatment by milk diet the majority of patients 
lose weight, the output of nitrogen is increased, the uric acid de- 
creased. The increased excretion of nitrogen is not due to cleavage 
of tissue proteins, but removal of retained waste products, for 
nitrogenous equilibrium is maintained when only 3! pints of milk 
is consumed during rest in bed. In nearly aU cases the dropsy 
diminishes. The loss of weight is partly due to elimination of water, 
and partly to the consumption of fat; it is most striking at the 
beginning of treatment. The outgo of nitrogen exceeds the income 
at first, but equilibrium is reached in four or five days. As the 
treatment proceeds, the excretion of water and loss of weight 
become less marked, and there may be a slight gain. In a small 
percentage of cases the excretion of urine does not equal the milk 
consumed. It is obvious that in such a case the dropsy will not 
be relieved; it will tend to be exaggerated. The hydraemic 
plethora and weight will be increased. There are other cases 
where the upper limit of the milk diet cannot be reached, because 
the consumption of such a large amount of fluid increases the blood- 
pressure, throws extra work on the heart, and unduly irritates the 
kidneys. The diet should then be abandoned, for the excess of 
fluid tends to apoplex}- and other forms of haemorrhage. ' 

Modified Milk Diet.— ^In the majority of cases it is not necessary 
to continue an absolute milk diet for more than fourteen days, 
some modification then being required; other patients cannot 
tolerate it because of idios^-ncrasy, nausea, or anorexia. Intolerance 
may be met by altering the flavour of the milk by tea, cocoa, or 
extract of coffee (which consists largely of chicory), cereal coffee 
(which is free from caffein), or extract of malt. If intolerance 
becomes very marked, some other food must be combined with it; 
the most suitable are rice, sago, tapioca, cornflour, and arrowroot, 
made into puddings, blanc-mange, or custard. Thus ^\ pints of 
milk, i\ ounces of sugar, and 4 ounces of rice or sago, for puddings, 
and i pound of grapes, would provide S3 grammes of protein and 



428 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

1,970 calories. The grapes, or an equivalent amount of dried 
raisins, would assist by preventing constipation. 

When the lower limit for milk diet only is tolerated, it soon 
becomes necessary to supplement it by the addition of fat and 
carbohydrate. We cannot then do better than add farinaceous 
foods — oatmeal, milk puddings, bread-and-butter. There is prob- 
ably no farinaceous food more suitable for these cases than oatmeal. 
The following would be a sufftcient dietary: 3I pints of milk, 
2 ounces of oatmeal, 2 ounces of bread, | ounce of butter, and 
I ounce of sugar. It contains 84 grammes of protein, 124 grammes 
of fat, 168 grammes of carbohydrate, and has a gross value of 
2,194 calories, and net value of 1,843 calories derivable from 
digestible and assimilable material. The milk may be consumed 
plain, as oatmeal and milk, oatmeal pudding, milk-tea, cereal 
coffee, sour milk, koumiss, or kephir. Bread, butter, and tea make 
a useful variation, and can be taken with a little stewed fruit 
(prunes, figs, or apples), or fruit salad. Now and then a further 
variation may be made by substituting rice, sago, or tapioca 
pudding for oatmeal; but, as a general rule, oatmeal should be taken 
twice a day in the form of gruel, porridge, or pudding. 

Kephir and koumiss have a distinctly diuretic action, due to 
lactose. Under the influence of these foods the urine increases 
day by day, the albumin diminishes, and in man}- cases disappears 
after two or three weeks. The small amount of alcohol appears 
to have no deleterious effect. The advantages of the sour-milk 
treatment are derived partly from the action of lactic acid in pre- 
venting the putrefactive processes in the alimentary canal and 
removing one of the causes of hypertension. This treatment is 
worthy of a prolonged trial in cases of granular kidney and other 
renal diseases marked by arterial hypertension and cardiac hyper- 
troph}'. It promotes a free secretion of urine, diminution of the 
albumin, a low^er nitrogen output, as well as decreased arterial 
tension and an improvement in the general nutrition. 

Mixed Diet.- — When the patient has been for some time on an 
exclusive or modified milk diet, i-t will be necessary to return to 
the mixed diet. The precise moment when this return should be 
made will depend on the patient's condition. An exclusive milk 
diet can only be enforced for two or three weeks at a time; but it 
can be resorted to again and again, if it is beneficial. Some patients 
do not improve on it, notwithstanding the increased flow of urine, 
diminution of albumin, and lessening of the dropsy. The diet, 
therefore, must be more generous; but the adoption of a purin- 
free diet might be tried for a time, especially for gouty, granular 
and sclerotic kidneys. It should consist of milk, cheese, cream, 
butter, eggs, white bread, macaroni, vermicelli, tapioca, rice, sago, 
cabbage, cauliflowers, onions, potatoes, spinach, lettuce, fruit, 
sugar, and a little spirit, claret, Burgundy, or Volnay, with mineral 
waters. By way of change a meal of light fish or tripe may be 
allowed; but meat, fish, and fowl should be forbidden; also sweet- 



Dir.r FOR CASTS WITH DROPSY 420 

broad, liver, kidneys, tea, coffee, coca, beans, lentils, asparafp^is, 
and malt liquors. 

In other cases the return to ordinary diet should be in the follow- 
ing order: Tripe, fish, fowl, veal, lamb, mutton, beef. The excre- 
tion of water, albumin, etc., should be carefully watched, as well 
as the effects of the diet on the heart and bloodvessels. If an acute 
exacerbation occurs, the milk diet should again be resorted to. 

If the patient is obviously past improvement, it is useless to 
attempt to influence the excretion of nitrogen and albumin by 
food. It is proper, however, to prescribe a light and nourishing 
diet, derived more or less from such articles as satisfy the patient's 
desires, care being taken that the heart and alimentary canal are 
not upset thereby, and no course is permitted which would be 
likely to shorten his days. 

Dry Diet.^ — The restriction of fluids has been advocated as a 
means of reducing dropsy. There can be no doubt of its value in 
some cases; but it is obviously more suitable for granular and 
lardaccous diseases of the kidneys, where the dropsy is more 
cardiac or vascular than renal in origin. The restriction of fluids 
in distinctly renal dropsy would not be of any great value because 
of the retention of the waste products of metabolism. 

The restriction of fluid to about 15 ounces a day causes a con- 
centration of the blood, absorption of fluids from the tissue, reduc- 
tion of pressure on the abdominal veins, diminution of the ascites, 
and increased secretion of urine; but such an extreme reduction of 
fluid is better reserved for those cases in which there is a distinct 
failure of compensation or dilatation of the heart.. But on no 
account should a dr}^ diet be prescribed without at the same time 
reducing the intake of salt. If this precaution is not observed, we 
may cause an accumulation of chlorides in the tissues, probably 
an increase of the oedema, or, at any rate, the oedema would not 
be reduced. In cases of acute nephritis or the subacute exacerba- 
tions which occur in chronic renal disease, especially of the tubular 
variety, the diminution of urine 's due to the impermeability of 
the diseased organs. To give an excess of fluids in such cases 
would be likely to lead to the increase of dropsy and hydremic 
plethora, besides increasing the work of the heart and probably 
causing a compensated hypertrophy to be transformed into'a dilated 
hypertrophy. These, of course, are cases of true renal dropsy; if 
we permit the consumption of the ordinary amount of liquids in 
such cases, we must endeavour to provide for its elimination through 
the skin by hot-air or steam baths, acupuncture in the dependent 
parts, Southey's tubes, etc. But in many of these cases a temporary 
reduction of the fluid to 2 or 2| pints daily may lead to an increased 
diuresis and a reduction of the dropsy In chronic, tubular, or 
parenchymatous nephritis, even when there is no dropsy, there is 
a danger of overloading the circulatory organs and precipitating 
a failure of compensation, if the patient persists in taking too much 
fluid; this is one of the objections to the milk diet. Therefore, the 



43'^ DISEASES OE THE URINAIiY SYSTEM 

amount of fluids which should be allowed the patient, whether 
dropsy exists or does not exist in renal disease, depends upon the 
power of the kidneys to eliminate it, and of the heart to keep the 
tissues from becoming water-logged. 

Salt-Free Diet.- — The dietetic importance of sodium chloride has 
not been satisfactorily explained. According to Gautier, " it pro- 
tects protein substances from disassimilation " — i.e., it promotes 
assimilation- — and its use, from this point of view, is economical. 
Bunge says the presence of sodium is essential to prevent the toxic 
effects of potassium. It plays an important part in the nutritive 
exchanges between the cells and the plasma, and stimulates the 
excretion of waste products by the kidneys (see the chapter on 
Vitamines). Absolute withdrawal of common salt from the food 
causes dehydration of the tissues, and this is the basis of the salt-free 
dietary. Salt is found more or less in all foodstuffs ; the daily require- 
ment is only 3 grammes (about 46 grains), but a healthy man on 
ordinar}' diet excretes 11 or 12 grammes daily. The excess consumed 
to suit the palate, under ordinary conditions, is eliminated by the 
kidneys; but the inability of the kidneys to excrete sodium cliloride 
and other inorganic salts in chronic renal disease is well known. 
The presence of an abnormal amount of sodium chloride in the 
blood and tissues is one of the causes of oedema, but it is not the 
sole cause. The amount of chloride excreted daily in the urine 
averages 7 "5 grammes; it is increased by the ingestion of ordinary 
food, muscular or nervous activity, and diminished by rest, fasting, 
and salt-free diet. 

The retention of sodium chloride in the tissues is due to one of 
two causes — (i) the kidnej^s are unable to excrete it; or (2) it is 
chemicalh^ combined with the cells. According to Marie, this 
combination occurs in the preliminary stages of cedema, and he 
calls it chlortire fixe. But by-and-by the tissues become saturated 
with water, and the chlorides begin to accumulate in the surround- 
ing fluids, and oedema rises in proportion to the retention; Marie 
calls this chlonire lihre. Whether this explanation is satisfactory 
or not, this much is known: When water is retained in the tissues, it 
requires the presence of NaCl to balance the osmotic pressure of 
salt in the blood. The greater the retention of water in the tissues, 
the more XaCl will be accumulated therein and the less will be 
excreted in the urine. On the other hand, there are cases of 
Bright's disease, where the kidneys are unable to excrete salt, even 
when diuresis has been established; therefore it has become an 
established custom of man}' physicians to reduce the intake of 
common salt with the view of relieving the kidneys from the duty 
of excreting it or of preventing its accumulation in the tissues. 
The indication for salt-free diet is the failure of compensation, 
characterized by diminution in the excretion of water, a cloudy 
appearance of the urine, high percentage of albumin, poverty in 
chlorides, and excess of cellular elements, and a corresponding 
increase of body-weight, with or without perceptible oedema. In 



SAl.T-rh'F.r. DIET 



431 



compensated granular kidney, and even in many cases of clironic 
piirencliymatous nepliritis, the chloride equilibrium is well main- 
tained — that is to say, the kidneys excrete a quantity of chlorides 
equivalent to the amount consumed; but even in these cases an 
occasional estimation of the chloride output is advisable, for there 
is a kind of invisible oedema, due to an accumulation of water in 
the interstitial and especially the deeper tissues, which causes an 
increase of weight without any perceptible oedema of the sub- 
cutaneous tissues. 

The cases in which salt-free diet is useful, therefore, are those 
cases of chronic parenchymatous nephritis with redema or dropsy, 
and granular kidney when there is a failure of compensation. 
Periodical weighing enables us to detect the formation of visceral 
and deep-seated tedema before the subcutaneous oedema becomes 
perceptible; but it is also advisable to compare the output of 
chlorides with the intake. There is such a thing as " dry retention " 
of sodium chloride, which is the same thing as Marie called chlorure 
fixe. This dry retention tends to cause an increase of arterial 
pressure, and, according to Widal, it may determine attacks of 
vomiting and diarrhoea, dyspnoea, Cheyne-Stokes breathing, or 
even epileptiform convulsions. 

A salt-free or salt-poor diet may be constructed by using figures 
given by Strauss, as follows :

In prescribing a rigid salt-free diet an attempt should be made 
to keep the amount of sodium chloride down to i\ or 2 grammes 
daily. This will mean the exclusion or reduction of the allowance 
of meat, fish, and meat broths; but as this is usually demanded on 
other grounds, it entails no greater hardship on the patient than 
forms of diet previously detailed Ordinary bread contains 5 to 
7 grammes of salt per pound, and milk i gramme per pint; sea fish 
contains much more salt than fresh - water fish. The proteins 



432 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

should be derived from milk, eggs, chicken, cooked without salt, 
tripe, fresh-water fish, cheese made without salt, and bread made 
without salt. Milk can be taken alone or with eggs, in the form of 
custard, in puddings with rice, sago, oatmeal, etc. Eggs can be 
taken in many waj^s without the addition of salt — e.g., custards, 
milk puddings, poached eggs, boiled eggs, omelettes; the latter can 
be seasoned with sugar instead of salt. Eggs can also be taken in 
" cream," souffles, and sauces. Jellies made of gelatin or isinglass, 
and meat jelly are permissible. The fats should be derived from 
milk, eggs, unsalted butter, fat meat eaten without salt, cheese 
made without salt, cream cheese, and salad-oil. Carbohydrates 
may be obtained from sugar, treacle, golden sjTup, jam, marmalade, 
bread made without salt, milk puddings without butter, blanc- 
mange, jelly, milk sauces, fruit, and vegetables. Bread and pastry 
made without salt are not unpleasant when eaten with stewed fruit, 
jam, marmalade, and unsalted butter. Vegetables should be 
allowed ad lihitum, because they can be made the. vehicle of flour 
and fat in the form of " white sauce." It is recommended that all 
vegetables should be cooked in plenty of water, with a minimum 
of salt, thereby reducing the proportion of inorganic constituents. 
No salt must be used when cooking or eating the food, except the 
small amount absolutely necessarj' to give flavour to potatoes, 
cabbages, and other green vegetables, and the salt must be put into 
the water in which thej^ are cooked so that it permeates them by 
the process of diffusion. The absence of flavour may be obviated 
to a great extent by a careful employment of spices and condiments, 
such as mint, thjme, parsley, marjoram, savory, bay-leaf, chutney, 
horseradish sauce, tomato sauce, mustard, nutmeg, cinnamon, 
allspice, vanilla, lemon, cocoa, chocolate, and coffee, and in some 
cases a small amount of pickles, such as red cabbage, onion, or 
cauliflower. The liquids allowed are milk, whey, buttermilk, 
weak tea, cereal or fig coffee, lemonade, fruit juice, and aerated 
waters, or a small amount of wine or spirit and water. The follow- 
ing are examples of diet containing not more than 2 grammes of salt: 

1. Balint prescribed: Milk ij to 2| pints, butter i| ounces, three 
eggs, saltless bread 9I to I2| ounces, and weak tea or coffee; calories 
2,300 to 2,400. 

2. Cauducci prescribed: Milk 2I pints, meat 10^ ounces, bread 
io| ounces; calories 2,200. 

3. Achard and Widal drew up the following series of diets: 

(i) Milk if pints, potaotes loi ounces, meat io| ounces, barley 
7 ounces, sugar ij ounces, butter i^ ounces; calories 2,274. 

(2) Bread without salt 7 ounces, meat 7 ounces, green peas or

45 ounces; protein 98 grammes, calories 2,295.

(5) Saltless bread 7 ounces, meat 14 ounces, butter 3 ounces, 
sugar 3I ounces; protein 117 grammes, calories 3,037. 

(6) Saltless bread 7 ounces, potatoes 24 ounces, butter ij ounces, 
milk 35 ounces; protein 79 grammes, calories 2,450. 

(7) Saltless bread 7 ounces, potatoes 10. V ounces, rice 3^ ounces, 
sugiur 3^ ounces, butter i ounce; protein ^^ grammes, calories 1,891. 

(8) Saltless bread i pound, potato i.^ pounds, butter i| ounces, 
white cheese^ obtained by the coagulation of i quart of milk; 
protein 126 grammes, calories 3,220. 

(9) Milk 2 pints, two eggs, meat 10 ounces, flour 2 ounces, sugar 
ij ounces, butter i| ounces; protein 125 grammes, calories 2,292. 

The dietary can be varied considerably, but it must be carefully 
considered, so that the consumption of protein is neither above 
nor below the limits prescribed in these pages, as it is in some of 
the above-quoted dietaries^. The following items would probably 
suit most Enghsh palates: 

Breakfast. — Oatmeal porridge, saltless bread-and-butter, one or two eggs 
(poached or buttered), raw egg-and-milk; fresh-water fish, eaten with lemon 
juice or vinegar. Jam, marmalade; tomatoes, or other fresh fruit. Tea or 
cereal coffee made with water or milk. 

Midday Meal. — Vegetable soup, saltless bread, cow-heel, tripe, unsalted 
tongue, fresh meat or fowl. Fish may be taken once or twice a week, with 
mayonnaise sauce, white sauce, or bread sauce. Milk puddings, creams, 
custard, junket, blanc mange, jelly, stewed fruit, salt-free biscuits, or crackers. 
Salt-free cheese. Green vegetables, kidney or snap beans, vegetable marrow, 
spinach, scorzonera, celery, cauliflower, and potatoes, all cooked without salt, 
or the minimum required to gi\e flavour. 

5 p.m. — Tea, with salt-free bread-and-butter, cakes, honey, marmalade, and 
other confections. 

Evening Meal. — Any article from list for the midday meal or breakfast. 

The salt-free, or hypochloride, diet, as it is sometimes called, 
presents several advantages over milk diet ; but the chief advantage 
is variability of the diet compared with the monotony of milk. 
There are some disadvantages from the withdrawal of salt from 
the food; the part played by salt in maintaining an equilibrium 
between the fluids of the body is important. In certain depressed 
patients sodium chloride stimulates the metabolism and especially 
the functions of the kidneys between the periods of retention; 
another drawback is the difficulty of establishing a tolerance of 
the salt-free diet; it requires about two weeks to do this, but with 
some people it takes a longer period. The use of condiments assists 
in establishing tolerance; but we must watch the alimentary func- 
tions, for it is well-known that an excess of spices tends to upset 
them and leads to other disturbances, which may be deleterious to 
the nephritic patient. It is not advisable to maintain a strict 
chloride-free diet when it is ascertained that the kidneys are elimi- 
nating salt in a sufficient quantits' — that is to say, when the cliloride 
metabolism is maintained in equilibrium. But, inasmuch as there 

^ This is the same as Colwick cheese, straw cheese, new cheese, etc., but it is 
prepared without salt. 

28 



434 DISEASES OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

may be a sudden unforeseen impermeability of the kidneys to 
sodium cliloride, it would be prudent to insist on the permanent 
reduction of salt, and to put the patient on diet which contains 
somewhat less salt than the amount tolerated — i.e., than the 
amount which the kidneys can excrete. 

The InJInoKe of Baths on Metabolism in Chronic Nephritis. — In 
healthy persons, under the influence of free perspiration, more protein 
is digested, and the metabolism of nitrogen increases both quantita- 
tively and qualitatively. In nephritic subjects the metabolism of 
nitrogen is lower in quantity and quality than in healthy persons. 
The amount of nitrogen in the perspiration of both healthy and 
nepliritic subjects is small. In health it averages about i gramme 
per diem; it is for the most part in the form of urea, and is equivalent 
to 3 or 3 '5 grammes of urea daily, or about one-ninth of that ex- 
creted by the kidneys. But Easterbrook^ says the skin is a more 
important organ in the excretion of urea than it is generally con- 
sidered to be. He made observations upon this function of the 
skin, and found that the excretion of urea by the kidneys varies, 
and the variations coincide directly with the activity of the skin. 
According to these observations the urinary urea reaches its maxi- 
mum point of excretion between 2.30 and 10 p.m., and the cutan- 
eoiis urea increases at the same time, the morning perspiration con- 
taining O'l per cent, and the evening perspiration 02 per cent, of 
urea. During severe muscular exercise the perspiration was in- 
creased in amount and the proportion of urea with it, while that of 
the urine remained normal; but during thirty-six hours after the 
exercise there was a rise in the urinary urea and a corresponding 
fall in the sweat urea. The cutaneous urea is always increased by 
exercise, but the urinary urea is imaffected at the time of the 
exercise, although it increased for a day or two after it. 

The principal effect of baths is usually considered to be increased 
excretion of water, salts, and probably toxic principles by the skin; 
but the evidence of Easterbrook is in favour of the opinion that 
both hot-air and hot-water baths are a powerful means of ridding 
the organism of nitrogenous waste bodies as w'ell as salts. The 
e\idence is of sufficient importance to suggest the strong recom- 
mendation of frequent bathing and the wearing of warm clothing 
to keep the cutaneous functions in activity, and to encourage the 
patient to take exercise, which will also increase the perspiration 
and cutaneous excretion of urea, salts, and other waste products.

CHAPTER XIII 

GOUT AND RHEUMATISM 

Gout. 

It was shown by Garrod (the elder) that the blood of gouty 
persons contains an excess of uric acid in the form of sodium 
quadriurate, and the urine an abnormally small amount. This 
accumulation may be due to excessive production or diminished 
elimination of uric acid; both factors occur in many cases. Three 
types of gout are recognized by Schittenhelm^ : (i) Metabolic 
gout, (2) renal gout, and (3) a combination of the two. The 
metabolic type is characterized by uricaemia, defective general 
metabolism, a subnormal output of endogenous uric acid, and 
delayed metabolism of exogenous uric acid. In the renal type 
there is also urica^mia and defective metabolism of nuclein bases; 
but renal and cardio-vascular changes are prominent, and the 
gouty manifestations are more or less proportionate to these changes 
It is, in fact, due to retention uricaemia. How and where uric 
acid is produced belongs to physiology. 

Uric acid is one of the nuclein or purin bodies which are closely related — 
viz.: Purin, hypoxanthin, xanthin, uric acid, adenin, guanin, hetcroxanthin, 
paraxanthin, Lheobromin, and calfein. Exogenous purins are those contained 
in our food; endogenous purins those derived from the metabolism of the 
nucleins and nucleo-proteins of blood and tissues. A number of intracellular 
cnzvmes combine to transform them into allantoin or urea. Proteases split 
nucleo-proteins into protein and nuclein, and the latter into protein and 
nucleic acids; niicleases liberate adenin and guanin from the nucleic acids; 
specific amidases (guanase and adenase) deprive these amino-purins of their 
amide group (NHg) — guanin becomes xanthin, and adenin becomes hypo- 
xanthin; various oxidases transform hypoxanthin into xanthin, and xanthin 
into uric acid; and finally uric acid is decomposed by uricolytic enzymes, the 
end-product being either allontain or urea. These intracellular enzymes are of 
the greatest importance in metabolism. They occur in the cells of the liver, 
spleen, kidnevs, muscles, and other tissues. The liver destroys uric acid to a 
considerable extent, and according to most authorities the kidneys of the 
human subject have a greater uricol\-tic power than the liver. The fasting 
liver has not the same power as the liver during digestion to decompose 
urates, which shows what a powerful factor the liver may be in causing meta- 
bolic gout. The experiments showing that the human kidneys destroy more 
uric acid than the liver are held to be in favour of the renal origin of gout. 
But the muscles destroy more uric acid than the liver and kidneys together, 
their relatively great bulk making up for the smaller uricolj-tic power of an 
equal weight of tissue. This explains why regular exercise relieves so many 
symptoms of uricaemia.

436 GOUT AND RHEUMATISM 

The thcoikb respecting the origin of gout are as follows: (i) The 
retention theory — namely, that gout is due to the diminished 
excretion of mic acid by the kidneys; (2) the excessive consumption 
theory — namel}', that gout is due to the excessive consumption 
of animal foods containing proteins and purins; (3) the defective 
metabolism theory — namel}', that gout is due to diminished oxi- 
dation in the tissues — that is, defective metabolism in the organs 
and muscles, arising from the deficiency of oxygen and catalytic 
enzymes. 

These theories have been discussed widely, and much evidence 
has been derived from experiments and used by the supporters of 
each. But the " rock bottom " of the trouble is a disturbance of 
the alimentary canal, probably a catarrhal condition of the mucosa 
of bacterial origin, leading to the production of toxins which may 
cause the defective metabolism of proteins and purins, and set up 
a degree of chronic nephritis leading to retention. The formation 
of such toxins is favoured by an excessive consumption of protein 
or alcohol, and the accumulation of toxins goes on until it culminates 
in an attack of gout. Few, however, doubt that gouty individuals 
possess some inborn defect, which lowers the resistance of the tissues 
to irritation, which is not possessed by persons who do not exhibit 
a gouty tendency. In such persons a slight injury, an indiscretion 
in food or drink, an overloaded intestine, may be followed by a dis- 
turbance of the metabolism, and provoke an attack of gout. " This 
suggests the idea," says Walker Hall,^ " that the nuclein metabolism 
of the gouty is run at high pressure, which may be only half or a 
quarter the normal capacity, and there is very little reserve energy. 
] f we admit this conclusion — and it is warranted by the facts ascer- 
tained- — we have the analogy of other high-pressure conditions as 
a guide in prognosis and treatment. The regulation of the nuclein 
or purin intake to the capacity of the individual and the conservation 
of the nuclein metabolism are called for." 

The Treatment of Gout. — i. Acute Gout.^ — Ihe dietary during an 
attack of acute gout should be meagre. For the first day water diet 
only ought to be allowed. It should consist of an abundance of 
plam hot water, barley-water, oatmeal-water. Imperial drink, soda- 
water, potash-water, Apollinaris, Perrier, Salutaris, Vals, Vichy, 
Ems, or other waters of the same character. On the second day 
milk-and-water diet may be allowed. It should consist of 2 pints 
of milk, divided into small doses, and diluted with whey, butter- 
milk, barley-water, oatmeal-water, or one of the other waters named 
above. On the third day he may have 3 pints of milk divided and 
diluted as before, a cupful of w-eak tea twice a day, and a slice of dry 
crisp toast, well buttered. This diet must be continued so long as 
any signs of acute inflammation remain. No alcohol ought to be 
allowed, unless there is definite evidence of cardiac weakness, and 
even then it may profitably be replaced by drugs. If alcohol is 
prescribed, a httle well-matured whisky or brandy is preferable

to other forms. On no account ou^ht beef-tea, chicken broth, 
soups, meat essences or jclhcs to be allowed. 

The transference to fish diet is bepim when the acute symptoms 
have subsided, some sole, plaice, or whiting, with dry toast and 
butter and a sprinkle of lemon-juice over the fish, bein^ allowed first 
of all. This mav be followed by a spoonful or two of rice, sago, or 
tapioca j)udding, or boiled macaroni and tomato sauce. The next 
day a poached or lightly boiled e^g, with dry toast and butter for 
breakfast; fish, some well-cooked vegetable, and milk pudding ff 
fresh fniit for the midday and evening meals. A regular dietarv 
is to be built up by easy stages. Care must be taken to avoid 
all indigestible and other articles forbidden to the gouty (see 
below) . 

2. Chronic Gout and Goutiness. — The indications are to remove 
the causes of metabolic derangement and reduce the purin or nuclein 
intake to the capacity of the organism for dealing with it. 

A faulty regimen is probably the cause of the metabolic derange- 
ment. Disorders of the gastro-intestinal tract and liver are most 
important factors in gout. Tt behoves us, therefore, " to put the 
house in order." Sufficient instruction has been given in the chapters 
on gastric, intestinal, and hepatic disorders; but a brief summary 
may be desirable. 

(i) The gastro-intestinal mucous membrane is easily irritated by 
an excess of fibrous tissue. The gouty person should exclude from 
his dietary all tough meat ; skin and gristle should be cut out of all 
meat, poultrv, or fish. Fibrous vegetables and those containing 
much cellulose should also be excluded. 

(2) A large amount of organic acids is equally injurious by irri- 
tating the mucosa and causing gastro-intestinal catarrh. These 
acids are a common factor in producing gouty dyspepsia and acidity. 
The late Milner Fothergill used to recommend a drachm of bi- 
carbonate of potash to be put to each pound of fruit when it is 
cooked. This has the double advantage of neutralizing acids and 
reducing the quantity of sugar required. Vinegar and other forms 
of acetic acid are injurious; therefore pickles must be avoided. Luff 
recommends people with gouty eczema to a\'oid strawberries, goose- 
berries, cranberries, apples, lemons, pineapple, and rhubarb {pic- 
plant). Lemon-juice is considered good for gout and rheumatism, 
but the citric acid is a local irritant to the mucosa, and it may do 
more harm before it leaves the alimentary canal than good after it 
is absorbed. If fruit does not irritate the mucous membrane, it 
will be ver>' beneficial to the gouty individual. Dyce Duckworth 
says: " Fruit has been condemned for ver\' inadequate reasons; a 
moderate amount of raw or cooked fruit may be allowed, apart from 
the meals, not only with impunity, but with benefit." 

(3) Carbohydrates. — These are vcrv prone to fermentation, with 
the production of irritating acids, and are a common cause of gouty 
dyspepsia. It is better, therefore, for a time to cut down the 
allowance of carbohydrates, especially sugar and sweet foods, and 



438 GOUT AND RHEUMATISM 

prescribe malt extract, or takadiastasc after a meal containing 
them, to assist in the transformation of starch. 

(4) Fats are very useful foods for the gouty to make good the de- 
ficiency from the restriction of carbohydrates. But their consumption 
must be watched. Foods fried in fat are bad, because acrolein, 
produced by heating the fat, is injurious. Butyric acid, often present 
in remarkable proportion in cooking butter, is very injurious. If 
there is a suspicion of hyperchlorhydria, the use of fat bacon, ham, 
pure butter, cream, olive-oil, and good salad-oil, will restrain the 
secretion of HCl, and so far are beneficial. If there is a suspicion 
of hypochlorhydria, the fats should be reduced as much as possible. 

(5) Spices and Condiments.— An excess of these substances causes 
or aggravates congestion of the mucosa, leads to hyperchlorhydria, 
catarrh of the mucosa, hyperaemia of the liver, and a disturbance of 
absorption and metabolism. A very moderate amount of salt, 
pepper, and mustard may be allowed; but cuny and other spiced 
foods, sauces, and relishes must be forbidden. 

(6) Alcohol should be forbidden theoretically, owing to its in- 
jurious effects on the alimentary organs, especially the liver, and 
metabolism in general. But a few persons are benefited by a small 
allowance of alcohol. This will be referred to later. 

The second indication is to reduce the nuclein metabolism and 
intake of purins to the capacity of the organism for disposing of them. 
This may be done b}' giving a low purin or purin-free diet. A table 
showing the purin bodies in food is given on p. 226. 

Purin-Free Diet. — According to Walker Hall, there is no purin in 
milk, butter, cheese, cream, eggs, flour, white bread, macaroni, rice, 
tapioca, sugar, cabbage, cauliflower, or fruit, and a combination of 
these form a purin-free diet. 

A low purin diet consists of the same articles, with the following 
additions: Tripe, codfish, neck of pork, very fat ham or bacon; 
potatoes, onions, and practically all fruits and green vegetables. 
Puddings may consist of milk, sugar, eggs, rice, sago, tapioca, and 
macaroni or flour; custards, junkets, jellies, and suet puddings. 
Beverages may consist of plain water, hot water, aerated and mineral 
waters, with a little claret (Volnay), Burgundy, whisky, or gin. 
The patient should be prohibited from taking butcher's meat, game, 
poultry, tea, coffee, cocoa, beer, and stout. Haig, who is one of the 
chief supporters of the purin-free diet, says the following diet is 
free from uric acid, and would yield 1,400 grains (go grammes) of 
albumin, enough to meet the daily requirement.

PIIRTX-FRFF DIET FOR GOf'T 439 

The chief trouble in carrying out the purin-free dietary is with 
regard to lunch and dinner. The following were framed by one of 
Haig's disciples: 

Purin-Free Dinners. 

First Day — Lunch. — Green vegetables, baked potatoes, butter; stewed 
&gs, J pint ot junket ; 2 ounces of pine-nut kernels (grated), with whipped 
cream. 

Dinner. — Biscuits, butter, i ounce of grated cheese or some milk curds; 
light pudding, stewed fruit and cream. 

Second Day — Lunch. — Green vegetables, potatoes • with butter, cheese 
sauce, and dry toast ; fruit tart with cream ; i pint of milk. 

Dinner. — Two boiled eggs, biscuits and butter; milk pudding containing 
\ pint of milk ; stewed fruit and cream with biscuits. 

Third Day — Lunch. — Potatoes and butter, green vegetables or salad; 
pudding or " cutlet " made of 2 ounces of ground nuts ; stewed fruit and cream 
with biscuits. 

Dinner. — Biscuits and butter, with cheese souffle or omelette; stewed fruit 
and cream with biscuits; roasted chestnuts. 

It must be recognized that purin-free diet is only a temporary 
measure; moreover, it is usually a low protein diet, and the physician 
must see that the proteins consumed do not fall below 80 or 90 
grammes a day. After one or two months, the diet should be im- 
proved. The first additions may with advantage be from the 
vegetable kingdom — lentils, peas, beans, and nuts. After two or 
three months of this diet, we may add boiled fish (sole, plaice, whiting, 
turbot, cod, and fresh haddock), tripe, neck of pork, and fat ham. 
Part of the meat bases and purins will be washed out during boiling 
of these foods. Some writers say the first meat allowed should be 
sweetbread, because the purins in it are " bound purins." I fail to 
understand what is meant by this phrase. If it means that the purins 
are bound up with the nuclei of the cells, and such nuclei resist 
digestion more than the cells of muscular tissue, it is certainly in 
favour of sweetbread. But is it correct ? Sweetbread contains 
more purins than any other organs. Moreover, Walker Hall found 
that 60 to 70 per cent, of those purins were absorbed, and at the 
most 40 per cent, escaped absorption, and were voided in the faeces. 
Burian and Schurr also found sweetbread gave rise to a larger output 
of purins in the urine than any other food. According to Lilienfield, 
the composition of thvmus gland [neck sweetbread) is — Proteins I7'6, 
leuco-nuclein 687-9,' histon 867, lecithin 7-51, cholesterin 44, fat 40-2, 
glvcogen 8, parts per 1,000. The composition of pancreas {stomach 
sweetbread) is similar. I should therefore never recommend sweet- 
bread (either thymus or pancreas) to be consumed by gouty people 
at any time. Nor should the spleen be eaten or taken in soup or 
gravy by such people.^ 

When ordinary' diet is resumed, the additions should be made 
gradually. First allow boiled leg or loin of mutton, boiled rabbit 
or fowl (the breast of birds contains less extractives than the wings 
or legs), pigeon, breast of turkey, well roasted rib of beef; sirloin 
and steak of beef should be added last of all. The following articles 



440 GOUT AND RHEUMATISM 

should be permanently' excluded: Veal, pork (except neck), goose, 
duck, high game, and greasy foods. 

Many writers exclude tea and coffee from the diet on account of 
the caffein. Burian and Schurr state that coffee contains 0-2 per 
cent, of purins, and causes an excretion of 0-075 per cent, in the urine. 
But it is unnecessary to exclude these beverages, owing to this small 
amount of purin, if the right kinds are used and the beverage is 
properly made. China tea is better than Assam, Indian, or Ceylon 
tea, because it contains less tannin. Coffee should be taken with 
chicory, or coffee deprived of caffein may be used; also dandelion 
coffee, acorn coffee, fig coffee, postum coffee, etc. Luff says: " It 
is erroneous to exclude tea, because it contains uric acid." Duck- 
worth says: " Tea, coffee, and cocoa, properly prepared, are harm- 
less. The greatest consumers of them know nothing of gout; but 
strong black coffee after meals is not advisable." 

Certain vegetables contain purin bodies and amide nitrogen, 
which are normally converted in the body into urea. These include 
asparagus, mushrooms, spinach, peas, and beans, and as a rule they 
should be prohibited. 

Is a purin-free or low purin dietary useful to the gouty person ? 
Most certainly it is. If gout is due to the defective metabolism of 
nuclein or purin bodies, these substances ought to be kept out of 
the diet until the organism recovers its powers of transforming 
them to urea. If gout is due to some disease of the kidneys prevent- 
ing their elimination, there is an equally powerful argument for their 
exclusion. Haig has inculcated the use of a purin-free diet for many 
years. Burian and Schurr made observations showing its utility. 
Walker Hall recommends it in consequence of his experiments. 
Brugsch and Schittenhelm have made equally important obser- 
vations proving its value. But the diet doubtless has limitations, 
and these have been discussed by Bryce and others. It is not a 
panacea, and in gout its use is hmited by the nature of the disease. 
If exogenous or food purins are badly metabolized, the endogenous 
or tissue purins are equally badly metabolized. 

Low Protein Diet. — It is frequently observed that a gouty person 
does better on chicken, fish, and other white-fleshed foods than on 
red meat. This is considered a proof that purin bodies alone are 
not responsible for the evil effects arising from animal food. 
Chicken and turkey contain more purin bodies than ribs of beef, 
halibut and trout more than mutton. The greater danger arising 
from beef and mutton is due to the fact that a gouty person does 
not digest their long muscular fibres so easily and thoroughly as 
the shorter fibres of chicken, rabbit, and fish. A careful consider- 
ation of all the points of the purin-free diet leads to the conclusion 
that it is a low protein diet, and many authorities^ believe that 
the curative effect is due to this cause. Many physicians find there 
are only a few cases of gout where a moderate quantity of animal 
food does harm, and many where it does good. 

The restriction of animal food is necessary. But it must not 



LOW PROTFAN DIET FOh' GOUT 44' 

be carried too far. Even Haig, one of the chief supporters of the 
purin-free diet, says: " My results have led me to believe that 90 
grammes daily is required "■ — i.e., a quantity of protein intermediate 
between Chittenden's low protein standard and the standards of i\\(i 
older writers. 1 have fully discussed this matter in the chapter 
on Food Requirements, and concluded that the allowance of protein 
ought not to be below i gramme for every kilo, or I gramme for 
every pound of body-weight, and that about one-half of it should 
be derived from animal sources. I see no reason for departing 
from this rule in treating the gouty. Duckworth says: " Witli 
respect to animal food, it is not only harmless, but beneficial to 
gouty persons if taken in moderation. . . . The notion that white 
meat is permissible, and red is not, probably came from the Conti- 
nent, where the ordinary white meat is veal. This is a very dif- 
ferent and superior article from any that can be procured in this 
country, while the beef and mutton are very inferior in texture 
and flavour to the products of Great Britain and her colonies." 
In so far as the discussion on purin-free diet makes for simplicity, 
it has done much good. But meat, even red meat, should not be 
excluded from the dietary. No class of foods is so productive of 
energy as animal food, and as many subjects from chronic gout 
suffer from want of tone or lowered vitality, a moderate quantity 
of meat is distinctly indicated for them. Meat should he taken once 
a day, preferably at the midday meal. It may consist of chicken, 
boiled fowl, stewed rabbit, occasionally game, mutton — ^especially 
shoulder and loin — tender beef (sirloin or ribs), and fresh fish of 
the white kinds only. Some fat boiled ham or toasted bacon may 
be taken for breakfast, and this may be varied by eggs or fish 
once or twice a week. Prohibit liver, sweetbread, pickled and 
salted meat, rich gravy and sauces. Only half the protein should be 
derived from animal foods. The following are examples of how it 
may be provided: 

1. Chicken, pheasant, breast of turkey, guinea-fowl, pigeon, or 
rabbit; 3I ounces of any one of these would supply from 22 to 26 
grammes of protein for the midday meal. One egg or J pint of milk 
with porridge for breakfast would make 2q to 32 grammes. 

2. Fish: 5^ ounces contain approximately the amount of protein 
following the names: Sole 17, plaice iJ'S, turbot 23, cod 25, 
haddock 26, bass and halibut 28, grammes. 

3. Mutton: 3^ ounces of roast leg contain 25 grains of protein, 
An egg yielding 7 grammes for breakfast would bring the total up 
to the limit. 

4. Beef: 3^ ounces of beef, containing an average amovmt of fat, 
would represent 25 grammes of protein An allowance of 2 ounces 
of fat ham or bacon for breakfast would bring up the total. 

5. One egg (7 grammes protein), with 2 ounces of fried bacon 
(5^ grammes protein), for breakfast, and 5-I ounces of sole or plaice 
for lunch or dinner would make a total of 30 grammes. 

6. A fillet of plaice or haddock for breakfast, and 2 ounces of 



442 GOUT AND RHEUMATISM 

rather fat beef or mutton for dinner would contain 30 grammes of 
protein. 

7. Oatmeal porridge, with J pint of milk and a poached egg for 
breakfast, \\ith 2\ ounces of chicken, turke}^ breast, pheasant, 
partridge, pigeon, or rabbit for lunch or dinner, would contain 
30 grammes of protein. 

The idea is to give one meat meal a day. The rest of the protein 
is to be derived from vegetable foods- — e.g., 4 ounces of white bread 
or roll contains 8 to 10 grammes of protein, ordinary brown bread 
rather less, and wholemeal bread rather more. An ordinary helping 
of milk pudding contains 4 to 7 grammes of protein, according to 
the presence or absence of eggs. 

If pulses or legumes are consumed, they should be taken in place 
of meat; they contain nuclein or purin bodies in about the same 
proportion. Two ounces of dried haricot beans contain 13 grammes, 
of dried peas or lentils 16 grammes of protein. These amounts 
are as much as the patient would eat at a meal. Nuts occupy 
the same position as pulses: 2 ounces peanuts contain ig grammes 
protein, almonds 16, walnuts, filberts, or Brazil nuts 12, and chest- 
nuts 9 grammes. They ought to be ground in a mill, and peanuts 
and chestnuts should be cooked. 

The Protein Fast. — In the treatment of gout it is advisable to 
insist on a fast-day once a week. On these days the food should 
consist entirely of bread or toast and butter, vegetables, and 
fruit. Ko animal food, milk, cheese, pulses, or nuts, should be taken. 
The object is to rid the system of superfluous floating proteins 
and the debris from metabolism. There is no need for hunger on 
these days; indeed, such a system would be absurd. Water, tea, 
mineral waters, may be taken. 

Exclusive Meat Diet. — An excess of animal food as a general 
rule is bad for the gout}^ Nevertheless, there are certain cases 
which do not improve very much on the dietaries previously given. 
In these cases a course of Salisbury diet — lean meat and hot water — ■ 
ma}' be beneficial by reducing the diet to the greatest possible 
simplicity. The cases in which it is indicated are — (i) Obstinate 
cases of chronic gouty arthritis; (2) recurrent uric acid calculi; 
(3) gouty headache of the nature of migraine; (4) persistent gouty 
dyspepsia; (5) amylaceous and intestinal dyspepsia in gout. 
Under this treatment indigestion is cured, the fermentation and 
putrefaction in the intestines cease, and metabolism is improved. 
It is followed by a disappearance of urates and toxins from the 
urine; joint swelling diminishes, pain becomes less, and mobility 
increases. The dietary has been detailed elsewhere (p. 210). It 
may be continued for eight or ten weeks, during which no carbo- 
h5'drate should be allowed, but merely lean meat and hot water. 

Sour-Milk Treatment. — Many cases of gout, attended by 
alimentary toxaemia, may be considerably relieved by a course of 
sour milk. The various forms of sour milk- — leben, yaourte, kou- 
miss, and kephir — are purin-free. Its supporters also claim that 



VEGETARTAN DIET FOR GOUT 4^3 

it is bactericidal, and reduces the number of putrefactive organisms 
in the ahmentary canal. This statement is borne out by obser- 
vations on monkeys and cats. By means of experiments, Herter 
and KendaP showed they could produce a change in the bacterial 
flora of the intestines by abruptly changing the diet from an exclu- 
sive protein to an exclusive carbohydrate diet, or vice versa. On 
a protein diet the flora were mainly of a proteolytic character, 
and on a carbohydrate diet they were mainly of a non-proteolytic 
and acid-producing character. With the change to the acid-pro- 
ducing flora there was a reduction in the amount of indol, skatol, 
and phenol in the faeces and indican in the urine. It is said that 
the sour-milk treatment has the same effect. The accompanying 
diet should consist only of bread-and-butter, cooked vegetables, 
and fruit. A little roasted or grilled meat, fat ham, or bacon, may 
be allowed now and then, and, in some cases, a glass of good red 
wine after meals. In the majority of cases 4 ounces of sour milk 
should be taken just after the meal, and this should be gradually 
increased until 2 pints or more are taken daily. The strictness of the 
diet and length of the " cure " must depend on the effect produced. 
Vegetarian Diet. — It is said that gout seldom attacks people 
who live on vegetable diet. The inhabitants of Scotland, who con- 
sume little animal food, and whose national beverage (whisky) 
contains no acid, are rarely afflicted with gout; but their immunity 
only lasts so long as they keep to their national beverage and diet. 
The sufferers from gout are principal^ those who have consumed 
much animal food and drink wine freely. Hence a vegetarian diet 
has been suggested as proper for gouty persons. The arguments 
of the vegetarians are that the salts of meat diminish the alkahnit}' 
of the blood, the salts of vegetables increase it^ — one causing a pre- 
cipitation, the other a solution of urates. Animal food, they say, 
contains uric acid or its congeners, and tends to an accumulation 
in the blood; vegetable foods diminish the uric acid in the body. 
But these assertions are not supported by fact. Klemperer^ 
found by experiment that — (i) The alkalinity of the blood of gouty 
persons is diminished very little, if any; (2) corresponding va.ria- 
tions of alkalinity are found in healthy persons; and (3) a diminu- 
tion of the alkalinity occurs in diseases in no way associated with 
the precipitation of uric acid^ — e.g., acute rheumatism, leukcemia, 
diabetes, carcinoma, and pyrexia. Luff^ says: (i) The solubihty 
of uric acid in the blood is not affected by diminished alkalinity; 
(2) the deposition of sodium biurate is not accelerated by a diminu- 
tion of the alkalinity of the blood; and (3) increased alkalinity of 
the blood does not increase the solubihty of the deposits of sodium 
biurate. But vegetables are good for the gouty. It has been 
proved that the ash of vegetables has a greater solvent power over 
sodium biurate than the ash of meat or milk. Luff found that the

444 GOUT AND RHEUMATISM 

presence of 0-05 per cent, and over of the mineral constituents 
of nearly all A'egetables appreciably increases the solvency of 
sodium biurate. This is true of Brussels sprouts, French beans, 
spinach, savoy cabbage, winter cabbage, cauliflower, turnip-tops, 
seakale, asparagus, lettuce, celery, beetroot, turnips, carrots, and 
potatoes. The ash of green peas has no influence on its solubility. 
The solvent effect of the ash of Brussels sprouts, spinach, seakale, 
and potatoes, is high, of celery and turnips low. But the effect has 
no relationship to the alkalinitv of the salt or its solution. Arti- 
ficially prepared salts have not the same effect as the natural salts. 
Uric acid first appears in the blood as sodium quadriurate. This 
is an unstable body, gradually transformed into sodium biurate, a 
comparatively insoluble substance, which forms the uratic deposits 
of gout. Luff investigated the effects of vegetable salts further. 
He found that the ash of spinach, Brussels sprouts, French beans, 
cabbage, turnip-tops, and turnips delays the transformation of 
quadriurate into biurate of sodium; on the other hand, the salts 
of meat diminish the solubility of sodium biurate, and have little 
influence in preventing the transformation of quadriurate into 
biurate of sodium. Hence all the fresh vegetable foods named 
above, if taken in sufficient quantity, would probably delay an 
attack of gout, and would certainly help to cure gout and goutiness. 
But the vegetarian diet usually includes dried peas, beans, lentils, 
nuts, and fruit. It ought, therefore, to be pointed out that all 
seeds contain a considerable proportion of nucleins, nucleo-pro- 
teins, and amino-acids; they are not purin-free. Their only re- 
deeming feature, so far as the gouty person is concerned, is that 
these foods are comparativel}^ indigestible, the loss of protein by 
non-absorption from legumes and nuts being from 20 to 30, or 
even 40, per cent. The vegetarian diet, therefore, is a low protein 
diet. I fail to see any advantage to the gouty from this on the 
score of metabolism. If the gouty man is to have nucleins and 
purins in his food at all, he may as well have them in a mixed diet. 
Bain says: " A diet consisting largely of peas and beans is capable 
of producing more purin-bodies than one composed of animal 
foods; gouty patients should be advised to eat sparingly of them. 
Those who advise a vegetarian diet for the gout\^ do not take a 
correct view of these facts." Duckworth says: " On theoretical 
grounds a purely vegetarian diet is extolled by some as a means 
of averting gout. Such a diet is condemned by physiology, and 
no less by common sense." Vegetarian diets usually contain far 
too much carbohydrate, and the consumer is forced to deal with a 
far greater bulk of food than is necessary. Hueppe compared the 
body of a vegetarian to an overheated steam-engine, which is in 
danger of exploding from using'the wrong kind of fuel. Luff says: 
" The contention that meat is poisonous to the human body on 
account of the uric acid it contains is preposterous. If meat is 
the poison a certain class of fanatics would have us believe it to be, 
we as a nation would have ceased to exist long ere this." 



BEVERAGES FOR GOUT 445 

Beverages. — A gouty man should drink from 2^ to 3 pints of fluids 
a day. 1 lie consumption of plain water may be encouraged. 
Water-drinkers or teetotallers proverbially have a large appetite, 
and are apt to take an excess of food, it is absolutely necessary, 
therefore, to insist that the gouty person must not drink a large 
amount of water or other fluids with the meals. If he eats his food 
dry, he will consume less; but what he eats will be better masti- 
cated and mingled with saliva. The patient should drink ^ pint 
of hot water slowly while dressing in the morning. At breakfast 
he may have one cupful of tea, coffee, or cocoa. Half a pint of hot 
water should be taken before the midday meal; at the end of the 
meal he may have a glass of wine or a small amount of well-diluted 
spirit, if these are permitted. At 4 or 5 p.m. he may have |- pint 
of hot water or weak tea; and, finally, | pint of hot water at bed- 
time. The w^ater may be plain, distilled, or alkaline. Water 
containing much hme is said to be injurious, but if this is so, why 
send our patients to Buxton or Contrexeville ? Water containing 
iron is also said to be injurious. Litliia, potash, ApoUinaris, and 
similar waters may be taken for a few weeks, but not constantly; 
there should be a variation. 

Cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate) makes a pleasant acidulous 
drink. A saltspoonful (about 20 grains) may be taken in a tumbler- 
ful of hot water with a little lemon-juice, and sipped slowly. The 
water should be boiled to precipitate excess of lime, or distilled 
water may be used. Edmunds^ says cream of tartar rapidly 
clears the system of urates by the formation of nascent potassium 
bicarbonate in the system. 

Theoretically, gouty people should take no alcohol, and most of 
them are better without it; it makes for faulty metabolism. But 
some people are better for a small allowance of good alcohol taken 
with one meal a day. The quantity must be less than what a 
healthy person can oxidize. Our working rule limits a healthy 
man's allowance to 2 ounces of absolute alcohol a day. Many 
gouty people have been in the habit of consuming regularly 3- pint 
to I pint of whisky, containing 5, 8, or even 10, ounces of absolute 
alcohol. It is clear that their alcohol-oxidizing capacity was 
originally more than 2 ounces a day. It is rarely possible, when 
Nemesis, in the form of gout, renal, or hepatic disorders, comes to 
such people, to induce them to abstain, and not often that they will 
limit the intake to less than 2 ounces. All we can do is to preach 
the 2-ounce limit, and endeavour to persuade them to keep within 
it, and, if possible, induce them to reduce it to a little wine or 
spirit with one meal a day. As a rule what these men take with 
their dinner or supper does them no harm. It is the irregular 
drinking between meals which does the mischief. Sir Dyce Duck- 
worth says: " A little good wine is certainly helpful to many elderly 
jmtients, but from 2 to 6 ounces is sufficient for them at one meal. 
The wines of Burgundy, the Midi district, Algeria, Hungary, Cali-

40 GOUT AND RHEUMATISM 

fornia, and Australia, are ■unsuilable for the gouty. Claret, as 
grown in the Bordeaux district only, and taken with water, is one 
of the safest wines to employ; it may disagree in some cases, but it 
is more often because half a bottle is taken when two glasses would 
suffice and be well disposed of. The same may be said of 
w ines of the Moselle. 1 here is little, if any, difference to be noted 
in the effects of red and white wine as far as the gouty are con- 
cerned. But Chablis is preferable to Sauterne, and contains less 
sugai". The best qualities of champagne, ten years old, and not 
too dry, suit many gouty patients well, if taken occasionally; but 
the rule as to quantity must be observed, and no mixing of wines 
at any meal. A little mature port wine is often borne very well 
by gouty patients. I know of no special virtue in what is called 
" tawny" port, sometimes vaunted as " safe" for such persons. 
]\Iany gouty patients are mtoierant of the smallest quantity of any 
of these wines. Therefore there is no fixed rule in respect to the 
kind of wine for the gouty. There can be no such rule. . . . British 
gout}^ persons are often urged to take whisky in place of other 
alcoholic beverages. There is no reason why brandy should not 
also be used. In any case the quantity must be small, and should 
never exceed 2 ounces, well diluted, and taken only at one meal 
a da}^"^ Cider is sometimes prescribed, but it is not suitable for 
all. 1 he best test is that of personal experience. If the consump- 
tion of cider has ever been followed by an attack of arthritic gout 
or gouty manifestation, it is not suitable for that person. It 
should be " rough cider," well fermented, and free from sugar. 
Such cider has not the injurious effects of sweet and higlily alcoholic 
wine. On the other hand, sweet cider, champagne cider, and other 
artificially prepared forms may excite gout. The prevalence of 
gout in Devonshire in former days is attributable to lead-poisoning, 
from cider being stored in leaden vats; the consumers became the 
subjects of saturnine gout. Such vats are not used nowadays. 
The organic acids of cider are not innocuous, and occasionally give 
rise to gouty dyspepsia. Malt liquors should not be taken by the 
gouty. Like sweet wines, they are hostile to gout, and the usual 
explanation is that when sugar and alcohol meet in the stomach, 
they become mischievous. The sugar in wine is as follows: Bor- 
deaux and Burgundy 0-14 to 0-21, Pommard 0*23, Hungarian 0-23, 
Moselle 0-25, Beaune 0-30, Austrahan 0-36, Chablis i-20, champagne 
1-92 to 2-5, port and sherry 5 to 7-5 per cent. 

The acidity of wine is not in proportion to its gout-producing 
property. Luff, Gan^od, and others do not believe the acids have 
much to do with the production of gout. The total acidity and 
gout-producing power are compared in the following columns. 
The first is from my own tables;^ the second by Sir A. E. Garrod:

Tills arrangement shows the most acid liquors are not the greatest 
producers of gout. The greatest producers are port, sherry, and 
other strong wines, and ale and porter; the least are claret, hock. 
Moselle, and weak ales. The strongest producers of gout are those 
containing most sugar and alcohol, which favours the idea that the 
injury is produced by a combination of sugar, alcohol, and acids, 
and that they disturb the colloid constitution of sodium quadri- 
urate, and throw it^out of solution. 

The Mineral Waters. — The employment of mineral waters in the 
treatment of gout is of great antiquity. But the treatment at the 
spas and hydropathic establishments is complex, and it is difficult 
to apportion the benefit derived from drinking the waters, the 
massage, baths, and electrical treatment. The natural rnineral 
waters, one and all, differ from the normal characteristics of 
ordinary drinking-water by reason of their containing an excess 
of certain mineral constituents and radio-active bodies, such as 
argon, helium, and radium, and other gases. The curative effect of 
such waters is out of all proportion to the mineral constituents, 
judging from chemical analysis. It is an error to suppose that the 
total effects of such waters can be expressed in terms of sulphate 
of magnesia, hme, barium, etc. If they did, it would be a simple 
matter to prescribe these salts. Artificial solutions are not equiva- 
lent to those prepared in Nature's laboratory. A tumblerful of 
Friedrichshall water contains 24 grains of magnesium and 20 grains 
of sodium sulphates with 30 grains of sodium and 19 grains of 
magnesium cliloride. It is a curious fact that an artificial mixture 
of the same strength has not the same effect as a tumblerful of the 
natural water. What constitutes the difference ? It is well known 
that all dilute solutions contain ions or dissociated particles of 
matter, and that such ions are charged with electricity, and have a 
great influence over the physiological processes of the body. The 
more dilute the solution, the more ions it contains. Most of the 
natural waters contain radio-active bodies. Ihe radio-activity is 
a measure of ionization of the metals in solution. Ihese points 
explain the difference between natural and artificial mineral waters. 
Bourdon exclaimed: " To give the name of ' Vichy water' to a 
solution of bicarbonate of soda is as absurd as to give the name of 
' wine ' to a mixture of alcohol, cream of tartar, and other salts, 



448 GOUT AND RHEUMATISM 

which wine is proved to be when analyzed. Go to the natural 
springs; Nature is far better than the laboratory." 

'ihe alkaline treatment of gout was formerly in the forefront. 
The alkaline waters of Contrexevihe, Evian, Vittel, dilute the 
hquids in the tissues, prevent the precipitation of uric acid, dissolve 
concretions, and assist in their removal. It was formerly believed 
that the alkalinity of the blood was diminished in gout, that 
alkalies increased the alkalinity and promoted the solution and 
elimination of uric acid. It is now known that the alkalinity of 
the blood is not diminished, and that the normal alkalinity of the 
blood cannot be increased by alkalies, 'ihe waters of Buxton, 
Wildungen, Evian, Vittel, and Contrexevihe contain sulphate and 
carbonate ot lime, 'ihey are powerfully diuretic, and some of 
them slightly purgative. They are anti-gout, not so much by what 
they bring into the body as by what they take out. They wash 
out the blood, liver, and kidneys, removing urea, uric acid, creatinin, 
and all other waste products of metabolism which have been accu- 
mulating in the system, and markedly improve the metabolism of 
proteins. 

Saline waters also have a reputation for the relief and cure of 
gout and gouty rheumatism. Ihey contain a combination of 
chlorides of the alkaline earths, and iodine, bromine, strontium, 
or arsenic, besides ions of the same metals. There is convincmg 
evidence of the value of these waters. They are primarily of value 
in assisting the digestion of albumin and starch, by favouring a free 
secretion of the digestive juices, restoring the mucosa to a healthy 
condition, and removing functional disorders of the liver. They 
have been known to increase the output of uric acid 25 or 30 per 
cent, there are objections to chloride waters, based on the failure 
of the kidneys, in many gouty persons, to excrete salt, and for this 
reason the salt-containing waters of Kissingen, Homburg, Wies- 
baden, and other places are said to be theoretically unsuitable; but 
clinical experience has shown them to be of great value. The 
strongest saline waters of Harrogate are very beneficial for chronic 
gout, if due precaution is first taken to procure a thorough action 
of the bowels. 

Ihe sulphurous waters of Harrogate in England, Pitkeathly 
and Strathpeffer in Scotland, Eaux-Bonnes, Luchon, Aix-les-Baines, 
Barege, Cauterets, Aix-la-ChapeUe, and Bagneres on the Continent, 
are renowned for their beneficial influence over gout, rheumatic 
gout, and allied diseases. They favourably influence the alimentary 
canal, the liver and kidneys; they relieve portal congestion, and 
stimulate hepatic metabolism, and increase the transformation of 
nitrogenous materials to urea, whereby there is a reduction in the 
excretion of uiic acid in the urine, and rehef of the gouty symp- 
toms. When combined with douche-massage and baths, as carried 
out at Harrogate, Droitwich, Buxton, Woodhall Spa, Strathpeffer, 
Salsa-maggiore, Contrexevihe, and other places, the consumption 
of mineral waters is decidedly beneficial. 



RHEUMATIC GOUT 449 



Rheumatic Gout (Rheumatoid Arthritis). 

1 lie nomenclature of arthritis is undergoing a change, which will 
not be complete until the pathogeny is more clearly known. In 
the early part ot last century all chronic joint affections were called 
" chronic arthritis." Garrod the elder iirst clearly distinguished 
gout from other joint affections. 

Chronic arthritis has been subdivided by HofEa and Wohlenberg into tlie 
following groups : 

1. Secondary chronic rheumatism ui the joints — i.e., chronic inflammation 
and deformity left by acute rheumatism. 

2. Chronic progressive polyarthritis, usually symmetrical, beginning in the 
small joints of the lingers and toes, characterized by an exudation and over- 
growth of the capsule. 

3. Arthritis deformans, either monarticular or oligarticular, due to old age 
and trauma. 

4. Ankylosing fixation of the spinal column. 

5. Heberden's nodes or large nodular growths localized in the terminal 
phalangeal joints. 

His, basing his opinion on clinical experience, considers gout stands in a 
certain relationship to chronic arthritis, and that both diseases are founded 
on a general diathesis, or latent morbid disposition of the tissues to disease. 
Ihe following factors are recognized by His in the production of chronic 
arthritis: 

1. Trauma, old haemorrhages, inflammation, tuberculosis, and osteo- 
myelitis ; these causes lead to mono-arthritis. 

2. Acute inflammation, leading to so-called secondary arthritis. 

3. Infectious diseases: scarlet fever, erysipelas, and other forms of sepsis, 
more frequently gonorrhoea, syphilis, and tuberculosis. 

4. Bacterial invasion, which he considers is not yet proved. 

5. Defective metabolism: metabolic osteo-arthritis. 

The dietetic treatment should tend to establish a better metab- 
olism. In rheumatoid arthritis the amount of food should not be 
restricted Instead of the low protein diet recommended for gout, 
a full and nourishing diet is required to improve the general con- 
dition and strength of the patient. Without voluntarily choosing 
foods which contain the greatest amount of purins, there is little 
doubt that the stimulating effect of animal food is beneficial. A 
low diet does harm. Meat, hsh, fowl, and eggs must not be re- 
stricted. Armstrong of Buxton^ says: " Order generous diet, 
always bearing in mind the associated gout and rheumatism, and 
with a leaning towards butcher's meat and the exclusion of carbo- 
hydrates." Garrod gives similar advice. Luff- says: " The diet 
should be as nutritious and liberal as the patient can digest. Animal 
food should be taken freely, but not to the exclusion of vegetables." 

The patient may consume most kinds of food. But care must 
be taken to avoid or prevent indigestion, catarrh of the alimentary 
canal, or disturbance of the liver. A daily evacuation of the bowels 
is necessary. The dietary for auto-intoxication is necessary in 
some cases, but the restriction of carbohydrates is equally essential

when there is any fermentation. The consumptiun of fat is useful 
b}- aiding general nutrition and pliagocytosis. Cod-liver oil, cream, 
butter, bone-marrow, and commercial preparations, such as Virol, 
are very benehcial. 'Ihe use of alcohol may be encouraged in a 
moderate degree, especially red wine — e.g., good Burgundy, Volnay, 
or other kinds which agree. Ihe sour-milk treatment is good for 
some cases. A dietary such as the following would be appropriate : 

Breakfast. — Bacon and one egg, or lish, or slice of cold fat ham and tongue. 
Stale bread, rusks, or dry toast, and butter. Tea or cotiee, with little sugar, 
but plenty of cream. Avoid jam, marmalade, and stewed fruit. 

1 1 a.m. — Half a pint of kephir, koumiss, or other soured milk. 

Midday Meal. — Fish, meat, poultry', or game; with cabbage, cauliflower, 
spinach, turnip-tops, kidney beans, boiled onion, or celery. Custard, junket, 
jelly, stewed fruit (sweetened with saccharin), and cream. One or two glasses 
of wine. Half a pint of kephir, koumiss, or soured milk. 

5 p.vi. — Tea with cream [no sugar), rusk, toast, zwiebach and butter. 

Evening Meal, 8 p.m. — Oatmeal porridge or gruel, milk and cream; dry 
toast or rusk, butter. A glass of kephir or koumiss at bedtime. 

The patient should avoid potatoes, turnips, carrots, swedes, and 
other roots or tubers, also milk puddings, pastry, suet puddings, 
Yorkshire puddings, etc., until there is an entire freedom from, in- 
testinal derangement and alimentary toxaemia. After this, the 
evening meal may be improved by the substitution of meat, fowl, 
hsh, or cold fat ham for gruel; and a little soup may be taken at 
the midday meal. 

Passive movements, massage, and douche-massage, electric 
light, radiant heat, and Bier's hyperaemic method have a proper 
place in the treatment. Fresh__^air is an important element, and 
change of climate is beneficial. 1 he disease requires a combination 
of warmth, low humidity, and equability of temperature, which is 
scarcely possible in England. Egypt, Grand Canary, and Ber- 
muda are good winter resorts; but Cheltenham is sheltered from the 
east winds, and is very suitable for cases which cannot be sent 
abroad. 

Chronic Rheumatism (Fibrositis) . 

The effect of cold and damp on people with a gouty tendency is 
to cause pain in various muscles and nerves, their fibrous sheaths, 
the sheaths of tendons, the membranous tissues of joints and peri- 
osteum of bones, 'this is due to fibrositis. The group includes 
lumbago, stiff neck, sciatica, neuralgia, neuritis, painful joints, and 
other conditions. It arises from bacteria of various kinds which 
get into the system through decayed teeth, the mucous membranes 
of the nose, pharynx, stomach, vagina, uterus, and other surfaces. 
Any discoverable septic trouble should be cured. 

In the treatment of these cases the food need not vary very much 
from the normal. Ihe quantity should be moderate, enough to 
meet the needs of the body, and a little more to encourage" good 
condition," without undue fatness. It should be hght and diges-

tible. A niudt'iatu amount of iinimal food sliould be taken. Two 
meals a day may consist of meat, tishi, fowl, eggs, bacon, ham, 
oysters, tongue, plainly cooked, and consumed witfiout rich sauces, 
forcemeat, or condiments. Custards, junkets, jellies, milk puddings, 
tuid other light puddings may be taken. Potatoes, fresh vegetables, 
and raw fruit are useful for their mineral salts and organic acids. 

Care should be taken to avoid indigestion, catarrh of the alimen- 
tary canal, hver complaint, and auto-intoxication. (See the 
articles under these headings.) Carbohydrates of all kinds should 
be taken in great moderation, especially sugar, jam, marmalade, 
sweet puddings, cakes, etc; if they have been habitually taken 
to excess, cut them out. Butter, cream, and other fats may be 
taken abundantly. Tea and coffee should be limited to one cupful 
twice a day, and taken without sugar; but plain water, hot or cold, 
may be taken abundantly. 'Ihe majority of rheumatic persons 
are better without any alcohol; but if any is considered necessar}-, 
it may consist of dry cider, .Moselle, hock, or whisky. Beer, stoat, 
and other malt liquors should be forbidden. 

Catarrh of the alimentary canal, genito-urinary organs, or other 
mucous membranes, must be cured. Such catarrh is favoured by 
(i) excess of proteins; (2) excess of sugar and other sweets; (3) ex- 
cess of cooked fruits. If meat has been habitually taken to excess, 
prescribe a lacto-vegetarian diet for a month or two. 

A warm dry chmate is preferable to sea or lowland air, and is 
suitable for a winter resort. A high, dry, bracing or stimulating 
residence is better than residence in a soft, humid atmosphere. 
Spa treatment is excellent for many cases. The sulphurous water of 
Harrogate Old Spring is reputed to be curative. Other sulphurous 
waters and brine waters are benehcial. Bathing, douche-massage, 
hot air, radiant heat, and cataphoresis are useful helps in treat- 
ment. 



CHAPTER XIV 

OBESITY 

The deposition of fat in the body is commonly due to super- 
alimentation or the consumption of food in excess of the require- 
ments of the bod\'. This is aided by insufficient exercise, diminished 
metabolism, or nutritional disturbance of glandular and trophic 
origin. Three t3'pes of obesity are recognized: 

1. Simple obesity, occurring in persons with high colour and good 
circulation. 1 hey are plethoric, eat and drink more than they 
need, possibly have a little glycosuria and arthritism. It yields 
readily to treatment. 

2. Anaemic obesity, occurring in pale, flabby persons, who do 
not eat too much, perhaps not enough. They are incapable of 
much exertion, and their circulation is probably defective. It 
may be a sequel of the former, owing to failure of the circulation, 
renal, or other disease. It is less easily cured. A subtype consists 
of those with hydrsemic plethora; their tissues become water- 
logged, owing to increase in the failure of circulation. 

3. Pathological obesity, arising from changes in the pituitary, 
thyroid, adrenal, or other glandular organs. 

Obesity ma}' also be classified as exogenous and endogenous, the 
former arising from a disproportion between the food consumed and 
theoutput of heat and energy, the latter from a normal consumption 
of food, but defective metabolism. Heredity plays an important part 
in man}' cases, obesity runs in families, the same as grey or brown eyes, 
tall or short stature, hairiness or baldness, and other family character- 
istics. The tendency to obesity runs through many generations, 
and many people who possess this quality become fat quite early 
in life. On the other hand, the family disposition may be to a thin, 
spare body.- These people never fatten, even when they eat and 
drink in excess. A placid disposition tends to obesity; a nervous 
and restless disposition to the opposite condition. Age also influ- 
ences the condition. In infancy there is a natural tendency to 
plumpness, when the supply of food is good, and it may arise from 
an excess of carbohydrates. In youth, a moderate degree of 
fatness is beneficial, especially at puberty, when physiological 
changes are in progress. From ten to fifteen years of age girls are 
fatter than boys; at a later period the reverse obtains. Undue 

452 



OBF.STTY 453 

fatness at this period is favoured by an hereditary tendency to 
ohesitw diabetes, and artliritisni. During early adult life, the 
human body and metabolism are very active, and the consumption 
of food or potential energy is counterbalanced by a corresponding 
display of kinetic energy iii the form of work or play. After thirty 
or forty years of age, the individual becomes less active; athletic 
sports are dropped, less walking exercise is taken, and the occupa- 
tion is probably of a more sedentary character. At this period 
the consumption of potential energy (food) exceeds the display of 
kinetic energy- — in other words, the food consumed exceeds the 
amount used; it is stored as fat. At a later period the circulation 
or the kidneys may become defective, and the retention of water 
and chlorides in the organism, hvdr?emic plethora, adds to the bulk 
of the body. 

The nutrition of the body is regulated ]\v the internal secretions 
of the glands. The influence of the genital organs on nutrition is 
shown by the effects of their removal from birds, oxen, women, and 
men. Obesity occurs in children when the development of the 
genital organs is delayed, and it diminishes when the reproductive 
functions are established. Lesions of the pituitary body cause an 
increase of adipose tissue in the body; removal of a tumour from 
this body or administration of pituitary extract is followed by a 
reduction of adipose tissue. Obesity becomes manifest when the 
thyroid gland is deficient in activity, and the opposite condition 
obtains when it is abnormally active. Many errors of nutrition 
are associated with glandular lesions, and various authorities 
consider obesity is a disturbance of metabolism, allied to diabetes 
and gout, in which the power of utilizing sugar is defective, while 
that of synthetizing fat remains normal. 

The normal diet has been much discussed in other parts of this 
work. According to Voit's standard, a man weighing 154 pounds 
(70 kilos) requires 119 grammes of protein, or 17 grammes per 
kilo, and enough food to supply 32 calories per kilo for a sedentary 
occupation, 35 to 48 calorics per kilo for ordinary muscular work, 
and as much as 68 calories per kilo per diem when doing extra- 
ordinarily severe work. These calculations were confirmed by 
At water. Now, if a man of sedentary occupation consumes as 
much food as a labourer, it is to be expected that the body will 
store some of it in the form of fat. If the food is normal, and the 
metabolism less than normal, it is also likely that the body will 
put on weight. The consequence is fatty infiltration of the tissues, 
and possibly of various organs. It is an easy matter to step over 
the boundary-line dividing sufficiency from excess; thus, 150 calories 
would be derived from any of the following: 2 ounces of bread, 
f ounce of butter, ij ounces of roast mutton, i|- ounce Cheddar 
cheese, 6 ounces of milk, or i] ounces of sugar. The storage of 
150 calories of energy day by da3% in the form of fat, would soon 
lead to obesity or corpulence. 



454 OBESITY 

Fat is derived in the body from an excess of protein, fat, or carbohydrate, 
when the total consumption exceeds the expenditure. The following 
equations will show the mode of transformation A

The ultimate destination of fat is to supply the body with heat and energy 
by oxidation. According to Chaveau, Gautier. and Hanriot, it must be 
transformed into carbohydrate before it reaches its final stages of oxidation, 
and for this reason carbohydrates are more readily oxidized in the tissues 
than fat, and when the supply of carbohydrate is sufficient for the needs of 
the body, fat is not used. It is probable, therefore, that in many cases of 
obesity, or tendency thereto, the fat and fat derived from protein of the food 
is not used at all, but stored up owing to the deficiency of oxidation. 

Many persons who consume more than the normal amount of 
food never become fat; indeed, there are many who never reach 
the normal weight. There are several explanations. The first is 
an abnormal oxidation and activity of the thyroid gland ; the second 
is derived from a consideration of the cutaneous area. A small 
body has a proportionately larger area than a large one, and a 
wrinkled body or angular person than a person with a smooth, 
rounded contour. The increase of surface in proportion to the 
weight of the body leads to a greater radiation of heat; in other 
words, a thin person loses more heat than a fat one in proportion 
to size and weight, and this leads to a greater expenditure of energy. 
Again, a healthy person ma\' remain thin because the absorption 
of food is abnormally low. This may arise from a peculiarity or 
idios\'ncrasy against one class of food; it may be the fat, protein, 
or carbohj-drate, is not absorbed. In other cases the proteins and 
carbohydrates are destroyed in the bowels by organisms, or there 
is a general failure of absorption owing to catarrh of the mucous 
membrane. 

Obesity is sometimes due to defective metabolism in the tissues. 
The only condition in which the consumption of oxygen and excre- 
tion of COa are decidedlv decreased is obesity. This may arise 
from deficiency of the intracellular enzj-mes or some substance 
which activates them. There is evidence to show that this ex- 
plains why one person uses all the food he consumes and another 
stores it as fat. But there are other points to be considered. The 
heat radiated from a rotund body is less than from an angular body, 
and therefore the heat lost bj^ a stout person is less than normal. 
Moreover, the layer of subcutaneous fat {panmculus adtposus)

SALISBURY DIET 15^ 

is a bad conductor ; it becomes t^radually thicker, and is a con- 
servator of heat. Fat is an inert tissue; it does not undergo active 
metabolism, and does not need nourishing Hke the active tissues 
of muscles, nerves, and glands. 

Treatment. — The indications are — (i) To remove any discover- 
able cause of retarded metabolism or curable disorder of the glands; 

(2) to harmonize the consumption of food and drink with the output 
— i.e., with the excretion of nitrogen and expenditure of energv; 

(3) to remove the ill-effects arising from the deposition of fat in the 
tissues and upon or within the organs of the body. There are 
various modes of meeting these indications; but the treatment of 
obesity generallv resolves itself into the limitation of the diet, 
exclusion of alcohol, ordering light clothing, the use of cold baths, 
and plenty of physical exercise. It can be shown that exercise alone 
will not cure the majoritv of cases of obesity. The patient must 
be dieted. But it is advisable to ascertain that the kidneys are in 
good working order and the heart not dangerously affected before 
putting the patient on a rigid carbohvdrate-free diet. The urine 
should be examined for albumin and sugar. The excretion of 
nitrogen by the kidneys should be at least go per cent, of that con- 
sumed; and it should consist of 85 per cent, of urea and 15 per cent, 
of other nitrogenous bodies. The patient's family historv and his 
own past history should be inquired into, especially with regard 
to food, drink, work, exercise, and sleep; each point may present 
some indication for modification of the treatment. The principal 
dietaries in use will be now considered ; but no diet ever devised is 
capable of universal application. 

I. The Salisbury or Carbohydrate-free Diet.— It has been described 
elsewhere. It consists of 3 pounds of lean beef and 5 or 6 pints of 
hot water dailv, providing from 1,800 to 2,400 calories of energy. 
The difference in calorie value is due to variation in the amount of 
fat interspersed between the muscular fibres of the meat. The 
consumption of a large amount of meat has been thought to induce 
the oxidation of fat in the body; but that is not a proper explana- 
tion. It was determined by Parkes, and confirmed by Atwater 
and many others, that an adult body requires about 300 grammes 
(io| ounces) of carbon a day to supply it with heat. The amount 
of lean meat required to supply this quantity of carbon would be 
6^ pounds, an enormous quantity. Therefore a diet of 3 pounds 
of lean meat is of low value; it only contains 140 grammes of carbon, 
and yields 2,000 calories; and the tissues of the body, usually the 
fat. are consumed to make good the deficiency. There are many 
people who perforce must live on animal food for months together; 
they get thin, and their muscles usually become hard and wiry. 
The thin and spare American who consumes much animal and little 
vegetable food is often held up as an example of the excessive con- 
sumption of proteins. 

Modified Salisbury Diet. — I have for many years prescribed 
Towers -Smith's modification of the above diet for cases where 



456 OBESITY 

the obesitv is due chiefly to excessive consumption of food. It is 
very effective in producing a rapid reduction of weight in robust 
and plethoric persons. The treatment is divided into three stages: 
First Stage : Fourteen Days. — The diet consists of 3 pounds of lean 
beef-steak, i pound of codfish, and 6 pints of hot water daily. 
These are divided into four meals. The meat may be minced, grilled, 
roasted, boiled, or steamed, or made into cakes; the fish should be 
steamed or boiled. The only accompaniments allowed are mus- 
tard, pepper, chutney sauce, and a very little salt or vinegar. No 
bread, toast, biscuit, vegetables, or other articles, should be allowed 
at this stage. 

Minced meat is prepared bj' cutting the steak into strips, removing skin 
fat, connective tissue, and putting it twice through a mincer. The pulp is 
then put into a large saucepan, with pepper, salt, and a little water, or stock, 
free from fat, and beaten until it is like a puree. It is then put over a slow 
fire, and stirred constantly until it is cooked through; this occupies fifteen or 
twenty minutes. It should now be free from lumps or hard bits. It is served 
in a bowl and eaten with a spoon. 

Beef-cakes are prepared by forming the seasoned pulp into flat cakes, about 
^ inch thick, and grilling them over a quick fire. They require to be turned 
once a minute imtil they are. broiled ; the time required is about five minutes. 
They should be light, not hard, nor overcooked. 

The water should be taken at an agreeable temperature. One 
pint should be taken at 6 or 7 a.m. ; the second pint half an hour 
before breakfast; the third half an hour before the midday meal; 
the fourth before the afternoon meal; the fifth before the evening 
meal ; and the sixth at bedtime. If it is desired, the water may be 
flavoured with a little salt, clear tea, or lemon-juice. It is un- 
necessar}' to flavour it, because hot water is soon tolerated and 
relished by the patient. The necessity for a great quantity of 
water to wash out the debris from the body is accentuated by the 
fact that 3 pounds of meat contains 286 grammes of protein, or 
43 grammes of nitrogen, which is three times as much as the body 
usuall}' obtains, and six times as much as the physiological mini- 
mum. 

Second Stage : Twenty-one Days. — In this period the amount of 
hot water is reduced to 4 pints a day, and the food is varied. The 
total consumption of meat and fish is only 3 pounds a day. It maj^ 
consist of any kind of meat free from fat (except pork) ; any kind 
of game, rabbit, or fowl; fish such as halibut, haddock, cod, turbot, 
skate, plaice, sole, or whiting. The patient may have 2 or 3 ounces 
of bread in the form of dry toast, stale bottom crust, captain's 
biscuits, unsweetened rusk, gluten bread, or kallari biscuit. A 
small amount of green vegetables, such as cabbage, savoy, Brussels 
sprouts, cauliflower, turnips, or spinach, may be eaten; and raw 
salad, such as lettuce, endive, celery, tomato, watercress, cucumber 
or radishes. The condiments are as before. 

Third Stage : Twenty-one Days. — The hot water is reduced to 
3 pints a day. The diet should be composed largely of the animal 
foods detailed for the second stage; it should be in the proportion 



RANTTNG DIET 457 

of two-thirds animal and one-third vegetable food. It may con- 
sist of any meat, lish, or fowl, as free as possible from fat; any 
vegetables free from sugar; dry toast, bottom crust, rusk, hard 
biscuit, kallari biscuits; and fruits, such as apples, which do not 
contain much sugar or starch. The patient may have a cupful of 
tea sweetened with saccharin, dulcin, or saxin, twice a day; and, 
if it is desired, a little cider, hock. Moselle, Volnay, Beaune, or 
other wine free from sugar, and diluted with soda, seltzer, Perrier, 
or Apollinaris water. 

Under this treatment the weight falls 2 to 3 stones in three 
months. It is useless to undertake it unless it is rigidly carried 
out. The patient sliould be impressed with the fact that there is 
no real hardship after the first stage of treatment — fourteen days. 
No person suffering from any organic disease ought to be put through 
this course. It should also be observed that it is quite possible for 
the diet to be followed by peculiar and serious consequences. These 
may be of a mental or cerebral type. Lazarus-Barlow^ says the 
close dependence of maniacal attacks on the administration of a 
protein diet strongly suggests that the symptoms are due to the 
absence of those metabolic changes occurring in the transformation 
of albumin into urea which normally occur in the liver. Ebstein 
regards obesity as due to the fact that obese persons have less 
power of combustion than other people; their metabolism is slow 
and delayed. Either from delayed metabolism, insufftcicncy of 
water to wash out debris, or some other cause, maniacal excitement 
does occasionally occur during this treatment. But it never occurs 
if the treatment is carried out properly and due care is taken to 
avoid prescribing it for persons having an organic disease. 

2. The Banting Diet. — This diet was recommended by Dr. Harvey 
for an obese person named Banting, who published it in a Letter 
to the Corpulent. It is interesting from being one of the earliest 
dietaries formulated for this complaint. It consists of 13 to 16 
ounces of animal food, free from fat — divided into three meals; 
3 ounces of bread, rusk, or biscuit ; 6 to 12 ounces of fresh vegetables 
and fruit; and not more tlian 2 pints of liquids. The meals are — 

Breakfast. — Four or five ounces of lean beef, kidneys, mutton, or fish ; 
I ounce of dry toast or biscuit ; a large cup of tea without sugar or cream. 

Midday. — Five to seven ounces of lean meat (any kind except pork), game, 
poultry, or fish (any kind except salmon, eel, or herring); any vegetables 
except potato, parsnip, carrot, or beetroot; cooked fruit without sugar or 
cream; dry toast, i ounce; claret, sherry, or Madeira wine, two wineglassfuls. 

5 or 6 p.vi. — A large cup of tea without sugar or cream ; a strip of dry toast 
or rusk; raw or cooked fruit, 2 or 3 ounces. 

Evening Meal. — Three or four ounces of lean meat, fish, or game; green 
vegetables ; a glass or two of wine. 

Bedtime. — A glass of spirit and water, without sugar; or a wineglassful of 
wine well diluted with water. 

To be Avoided. — Pork, veal, eels, salmon, herrings, the vegetables named 
above, champagne, port, stout, porter, ale, and beer. 

^ " Textbook of Pathology," p. 654. 



458 OBESITY 

The entire dietary contains 170 to 180 p^rammes of protein. 
7 to 10 grammes of fat, 70 to 80 grammes of carbohydrate, and 
yields at most 1,160 calories of energy. The energy is below the 
expenditure of a man at rest, and the body must be drawn upon for 
the balance. The wine is unnecessary, and may be replaced by a 
little more vegetable food. 

3. Mixed Diets.^ — The Banting diet is a good example of mixed 
feeding for the reduction of obesity. One and all, mixed diets are 
examples of low feeding— i.e., the value of the food is reduced to 
1,100, 1,200, or 1,500 calories, according to the kind of case and the 
rapiditv of reduction desired. The table on pp. 460, 461 gives 
dietaries recommended by prominent physicians. They vary owing 
to differences in the opinions of the prescribers and the effect to be 
produced. Richter allows potato, but no bread. Ebstein regards 
obesity as due to deficient combustion, or slow and delayed 
metabolism, of carbohydrates and fat. He prescribes fat in his 
diet on the assumption that it lessens appetite, produces a feeling 
of satiety, and lessens thirst. This would be wrong, except when 
there is a tendency to glycosuria, because fat is more difficult of 
oxidation than carboh3'drate. His diet includes about 3 pints of 
liquid, including two large cups of tea, which enable the patient to 
bear, without exhaustion, the reduction of food. Hirschfield's diet 
is similar, but he allows more carbohydrate; he recommends the 
food should contain- — Minimum : protein 100, fat 41, carbohydrate 
50. grammes; calories, 1,000. Maximum: protein 140, fat 65, 
carbohydrate 167, grammes; calories, 1,400. Oertel reduces the 
amount of fluids consumed. Although water is not fattening, it 
is an undoubted fact that the continual excessive consumption of 
liquids increases the weight of the body. The observations of 
Ter-Gregorianz and Karchagin^ support this experience: when large 
quantities of water are consumed, the subjects increase in weight, 
assimilation is slightly decreased, but metabolism is increased; 
when the quantity of water consumed is less than normal, the 
weight of the body diminishes, but assimilation is improved, and 
the metabolism slightl}^ diminished. Therefore, a limitation of 
the intake of fluids in cases of obesity is a correct procedure. 
Oertel's treatment includes i| pint of liquids daily; at the same 
time he recommended a large consumption of meat, and this is the 
weak point in his treatment; a marked increase in the consumption 
of protein is not borne well if the intake of liquids is limited. 
Schweninger prescribes a similar diet to Oertel; but he forbids any 
liquid to be taken with the meals. This is an important rule in 
feeding the obese: the person eats less when no liquid is taken with 
the food. Oertel's and Schweninger's dietaries are suitable" for 
anaemic obesity and hydremic plethora. Germain See^ pointed out, 
however, that the restriction of fluids would be very injurious to

of Agriculture. 

2 " Du Regime Alimentaire." 



DRY DTI-.T 459 

gout}- persons and those with uric acid deposits; but he strictly 
forbids this class of obese persons to take alcoliol, because of its 
well-known tendency to favour fatty degeneration. Von Noorden^ 
considers that, as the heart is usually weakened in obese persons, 
the intake of fluids should not be reduced below 2^ pints. Von 
Noorden's treatment of obesity consists in a limitation of the 
calorific value of the food rather than restriction of liquid (see 
table). He recommends small and frequent meals, containing a 
minimum or maximum, according to the effects desired. Richter 
also prescribes small and frequent meals. Boas^ does not agree 
with restriction of fluids; and he considers it is essential that the 
proteins shoiild not be reduced below go grammes daily, while the 
non-nitrogenous foods sliould be much reduced; but he thinks it 
is immaterial whether fat or carbohydrate is most reduced. 

4. Dry Diet. — The Oertel-Schweninger diet is denominated a 
" dry diet " when the total fluids are cut down to 15 or 25 ounces 
daily. The liquids may consist of a small cup of tea or coffee at 
breakfast and tea-time, and a similar amount of water, wine and 
water, or spirit and water, after the midday and evening meals. 
It is especially useful in some cases complicated by fatty degenera- 
tion of the heart, dyspnoea, palpitation, etc. ; and for those who 
habitually drink too much. Groco^ says: " It is doing good if the 
elimination of urine remains unchecked; but if the urine becomes 
scanty, the perspiration diminished, or the digestion disturbed, 
it is doing harm, and should be stopped." It sometimes causes 
gastro-intestinal disturbances, gout, renal colic, and neurasthenia. 
The restriction of fluid is an empirical measure; there is no satis- 
factory explanation of the reduction of fat. The reduction of 
weight is largely due to removal of water from the tissues or 
reduction of hydrtemic plethora. The reduction of fat is mainly 
due to the low calorie value of the diet; water is produced in the 
tissues by the oxidation of fat. The fluid foods should be reduced 
gradually. No dietary can be framed which is universally applic- 
able, but the following is a useful example:

402 OBESITY 

5. The Milk Cure. — This is applicable to many cases of abdominal 
plethora, witli cardiac weakness or renal inadequacy. One pint of 
milk contains 21 grammes of protein and 410 calories of energy. 
Breakfast should consist of i pint of milk only; lunch may consist of 
6 ounces of lean meat, a plateful of boiled vegetables (no bread or 
])otatoes), and h pint of junket; tea, h pint of junket and two cups 
of tea, little sugar; and dinner of 1 pmt of milk and two apples. 
The patients seldom complain of hunger or thirst. I have reduced 
the weight of many people with such diet. It contains enough 
protein, while the fat and carbohydrate is diminished, and the heat 
vidue is about 1,800 calories. If the midday meal consists only of 
I pint of milk or junket, the total calorie value will be 1,305 calories. 
The milk may be boiled, taken plain, hot or cold, in the form of 
junket or soured miJk. Karrel, Moritz, Lenhartz, Roemheld, and 
others have obtained excellent results from its use. Moritz recom- 
mends the milk to be taken 2 pint every three hours; but this 
mode is inconvenient for people who desire to follow their occupa- 
tion, and is applicable only to those who are more or less confined to 
the house. 

" Milk days " were instituted by Roemheld; he recommends 
about 2 pints of milk, preferably skim milk, to be taken twice a 
w^eek, and nothing else. On the other days he allows sufficient 
ordinary food to supply 16 to 24 calories per kilo (8 to 11 calories 
per pound) of body-weight. 

" Miniature cures," lasting hve to eight days, were adopted by 
Strauss^ for the treatment of cases complicated by glycosuria, gout, 
or cardiac affections. He keeps the patient in bed during the 
" cure," has him massaged, and allows a tumblerful of milk four 
or hve times a day, and on the last two days, an apple or orange. 
In the " after-cure " he prescribes for a few days a mixed diet of 
meat, sausage, vegetables, milk, and a little bread; the whole 
}-ieiding 1,500 or 1,600 calories. A repetition of the cure is recom- 
mended after an interval of a few weeks. 

A consideration of the milk cure shows that the beneficial results 
are due primarily to the low calorie value of the diet; secondly, to 
the removal of superfluous sodium chloride, milk being practically 
salt-free. Strauss considers that for every gramme of sodium 
chloride excreted there is a corresponding excretion of 6 ounces of 
water. 

6. The Fruit Cure. — A diet of fruit and nuts, when properly 
arranged, is sufficient to supply the needs of the body. But it it is 
not properly balanced, muscular tissue as well as fat will be lost. 
The fohowing examples are from a well-known source: 

(ij Grapes, Olives, Olive-Oil, and Tomatoes. — During four days 
observation a man consumed 2if pounds of grapes, 4 ounces of 
olives, 2 ounces of tomatoes, and | ounce of olive-oil. These con- 
tained protein 55, fat 92, carbohydrates 890 ; energy 4,908 calories. 
The energy of food assimilated in four days was 4,220 calories, or 

^ Wien. Med. Klinik., March 27, 1910. 



THE FRUI r CUR/-: 403 

1,055 *^^l<Jiic'S daily, and the protein only about 14 grammes. He 
lost 2 pounds weight in two days. An examination showed daily 
income of nitrogen 389 grammes, daily outgo in urine and fieces ^'Sg 
grammes; loss, 2 89 grammes, equal to .^ ounce of muscular tissue 
daily. In another period of four days some Brazil nuts and walnuts 
were added, and there was no loss of nitrogen from the body — i.e., 
there was no destruction of muscular tissue, although there was a 
loss of 1 pound weight. 

The grape cure is undertaken for the cure of obesity with abdo- 
minal plethora, and is worthy of recommendation if care is taken 
to supplement it by meat, milk, or nuts, to supply protein. 

(2) Pears, Cocoanut, and Cheese. — During four days' metabolism 
experiment a man consumed 22 pounds of pears, 2 pounds of cocoa- 
nut, 2 ounces of cheese, -^ ounce of tomato, and 2| ounces of olive- 
oil. He assimilated from the food — protein 106, fat 544, carbo- 
hydrates 1,326 grammes, and energy 11,875 calories; equal to 
27 grammes of protein and 2,970 calories daily. 1 here was a loss 
of 1 1 pounds weight and about | ounce of muscular tissue. 

(3) Apples, Dates, and Peanuts.— During four days the subject 
consumed 13I pounds of apples, 2^ pounds of dates, and ig- pounds 
of peanuts. Ihe body received daily: Protein 56, fat 68, carbo- 
hydrate 350, grammes ; and 2,360 calories. 1 he nitrogen and weight 
were kept in equilibrium. Without the dates and only i pound of 
peanuts the calories would be reduced to 1,600 per diem, but there 
would be a slight deficiency of nitrogen. 

(3) Bananas and WalniUs. — In four days the subject consumed 
14 pounds of bananas and 2\ pounds of walnuts, the daily pro- 
\-ision was: Protein 31, fat 60, carbohydrate 182, grammes; and 
1,441 calories of available energy. In this period the body lost 
2i pounds, including 3 grammes (46 grains) of muscular tissue — not 
a great amount. 

(4) Apples and Walnuts resulted in a loss of 4 pounds in four days. 
I he subject consumed 13! pounds of apples and if pound of walnuts, 
making a daily provision of — Protein 34, fat 109, carbohydrate 128, 
grammes; and 1,400 calories of available energy. Ihe nitrogen 
balance was maintained; in fact, there was a slight gain of protem. 

(5) Apples, Bananas, and Brazil Nuts. — Loss of weight, i pound 
in four days. The total food included — Apples 13, bananas 11, 
Brazil nuts 2, pounds; The daily portion contained — Digestible 
protein 30, fat 85, carbohydrate 214, grammes; and 1,891 calories. 

Ihe above examples show that a fruitarian diet is applicable to 
the reduction of obesity. But care ought to be taken that the 
l)rotein is not reduced below the physiological requirement. This 
may be done by the use of nuts. 1 allien^ strongly recommends this 
treatment for those who have been gross feeders and drinkers, who 
suffer from obesity, abdominal plethora, haemorrhoids, gout, renal 
calculus, or migraine, as well as for semi-invalids who awake each 
morning with a headache and disagreeable taste in the mouth. 

^ Jour, des Prat., May 7, 1910, 



464 U OBESITY 

The fruit cure, he maintains, is valuable because it is a low protein 
diet, and supplies the system with an abundance of salts of the 
organic acids. He specially recommends grapes, apples, oranges, 
raisins, and fresh vegetables; but, he adds, " the incorrect use of a 
good remedy is more often responsible for bad results than the 
disease itself." 

Summary. — (i) Ordinary obesity in persons who enjoy good 
health may be reduced by the Salisbury or carbohydrate-free diet; 
the Towers-Smith modification is better adapted for most persons, 
and is very safe when there is no organic disease. (2) Obesity in 
gouty and glycosuric persons may also be safely treated by Towers- 
Smith's dietary. But it should be remembered that it is not safe 
to cut off all carbohydrates suddenly in a marked case of glycosuria, 
especially when there is acetonuria. (3) In obesit}' with fatty heart, 
beer heart, other cardiac diseases, and general debility, the methods 
of slow reduction should be adopted. Treatment should be begun 
by a milk diet, preferably combined with rest in bed, and then Von 
iSoorden's or Oertel's diet may be used. In such cases I consider 
it is essential to reduce the intake of fluids and forbid the use of salt. 
(4) In renal cases a diet containing only 70 or 80 grammes of protein 
is the best. Salisbury's, Towers-Smith's, Banting's, and other high 
protein diets would be injurious. The miniature cures of Strauss 
are useful. Milk diet is beneficial. Fruit cures may also be recom- 
mended. 1 he reduction of weight should not be too rapid ; 3 pounds 
a week is as much as ought to be allowed. In heart disease, renal 
affections, and other forms of ill-health, 2 pounds a week will suffice. 

7. The Diet after Reduction. — The dietary should now be based 
on a reduced scale. Voit's standard of 1-7 grammes of protein and 
40 calories per kilo is too high for obese persons. Many people 
do not utilize more than 28 or 30 calories per kilo, or 14 calories 
fey found. The animal food should not be reduced, as it contains 
less carbon than \'egetable food; the protein should not be reduced 
below I '5 grammes per kilo, or | gramme per pound. The require- 
ments should be estimated from the standard w^eight of the body at 
a corresponding age, making allowance for the increased breadth 
of thorax. The table by Brandeth Symonds (see p. 465) may serve 
as a guide to the normal weight of males at various ages. 

At twenty years of age the normal weight of a man 68 inches high 
would be 140 pounds; at thirty it would be 154 pounds, and at 
forty-five about 168 pounds. It is possible at this age that his 
weight is 28 or 30 pounds in excess of the normal; and in a drinker 
it may be 50 pounds in excess. After many years' experience in 
treatment, I do not think it is advisable to attempt to reduce such 
persons to the w^eights given in anthropometrical tables. If a man's 
actual weight is 200 pounds when he ought to be only 150 pounds, 
I should not reduce more than half or two-thirds of the excess. Let 
his permanent dietary be calculated, sa}-, on 167 pounds (76 kilos), 
with an allowance of 28 calories and 17 grammes of protein per 
kilo, or 2,128 calories and 129 grammes of protein. I do not con- 



DIET AFTER REDUCTION 



465 



sider the total protein for any obese person should be permanently 
reduced below 100 grammes a day, nor the supply of food below 
14 calories per pound. Such permanent dietary may be drawn 
from the following lists: 

Soups. — Any kind of clear soup, except those containing vermi- 
celli, macaroni, rice, barley, oats. 

Fish. — Any kind which does not contain more than i or 2 per 
cent, of fat; sole, plaice, smelts, haddock, turbot, flounder, whiting,

Meat. — All kinds of meat not cooked with fat, and other kinds, 
when divested of fat, may be consumed — -e.g., beef, beefsteak, leg 
or shoulder of mutton, veal, sweetbread, kidneys, fowl, pheasant, 
turkey breast, guinea-fowl, partridge, pigeon, hare, leveret, rabbit, 
lean ham, or tongue. Eggs and cheese may also be consumed. 
To be prohibited : Fat meat, pork, bacon, fat ham, goose, duck, and 
other fat food. Butter may be taken in strictest moderation. 

Sauces.— The following are useful accompaniments to meat or 
game: Apple, onion, gooseberry, and spinach sauces; also sauce 
made from mint, lemon-juice, tomato, horseradish, or mushrooms. 

Carbohydrates. — The allowance ought to be strictly limited. It 
may consist of stale bread, bottom crust, drv toast, kallari biscuit, 

3<5 



466 OBESITY 

Caseoid bread, captain's biscuits, almond cakes, gluten bread, 
soya bread, etc. The total should be 4 to 6 ounces a day. 

Cooked Vegetables. — Cabbage, savoy, Brussels sprouts, kale, red 
cabbage (saur kraut or pickle), cabbage sprouts, cauliflower, turnip- 
tops, seakale, cardoon, artichoke, spinach, vegetable marrow 
(squash), pumpkin, green peas, kidney beans (string or snap), 
turnips, swedes [Rut a baga), new potatoes, boiled celery, boiled 
lettuce, cucumber, beetroots, leeks, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms. 

Salads. — Lettuce, endive, tomato, mustard and cress, white heart 
cabbage, onion, cucumber, watercress, garlic, etc. Salad oil should 
not be used, except a teaspoonful or two for making mayonnaise sauce. 

Dessert.- — All nuts, except chestnuts; all fruits, except sweet ones. 
Cooked fruits may have their acidity partly neutralized by the 
addition of bicarbonate of soda or potash, and i per cent, solution 
of saccharin can be used in place of sugar. Apples, pears, plums, 
damsons, gooseberries, strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries; 
apple-snow, compote of apricots, gooseberry fool, damson cheese, 
raspberry cream, rhubarb mould, etc., can all be prepared in that 
way. 

Puddings ma}- be taken occasionally, especially those made of 
gluten flour, macaroni, vermicelli, almond, or cocoanut. Calves'- 
foot, milk jelly, and other jellies may be taken in moderation. Egg- 
snow, eg^ custard, junket, and similar preparations may be taken. 
No sugar or cream should be taken with them. 

Beverages.— T\\& total consumption should not exceed 2 pints a 
day. It may consist of plain water; tea, coffee without chicory, 
and cocoa made from the nibs; gaseous waters — -e.g., Salutaris, 
Puralis, Perrier, Apollinaris, soda, potash, or lithia waters; alkaline 
waters — e.g., Vals, Vichy, Ems, Selters, Bath-sulis, Contrexeville. 
Fruit-juices may be taken in water and sweetened with saccharin 
or dulcin. A little alcohol is allowable; it may consist of dry cider, 
hock, Moselle, Chablis, Volnay, claret, whisky, or brandy. All 
alcoholic beverages must be diluted, and the amount of alcohol 
reckoned in the calorie value of the food. Moselle-cup, claret-cup, 
champagne-cup, punch, and similar diluted beverages may be 
allowed in moderation. 

Articles Prohibited. — Excess of fat, fat meat, butter, dripping, 
margarine, salad oil, cream, or other fat foods. Milk pudding, 
cakes, pastry, boiled suet puddings,, should only be taken occasion- 
ally to prevent monotony of food. . Cream cheese, rich ripe cheese, 
should be forbidden. Also duck, pork, liver, herring, mackerel, 
eel, salmon, caviar, sardines, thick soups, sugar, treacle, syrup, 
jam, preserves, marmalade, sweet puddings, confectionery, sweet 
fruits (dates, prunes, figs, grapes, cherries, mulberries, dried 
currants, raisins, sweet apples or pears), sweet wines (port, sherry, 
Madeira, Marsala) . Starchy foods should not be allowed ad libitum ; 
for a long period it may be advisable to forbid rice, sago, tapioca, 
cornflour (corn starch), blanc-mange, custard made with powder; 
also oatmeal, maize, wheat, and other breakfast foods, dried peas

and beans. Tlie amount of bread and potato must be strictly 
limited; new potatoes contain less starch than old ones; Jerusalem 
artichokes contain sugar, but no starch. Sweet potatoes, carrots, 
parsnips, asparagus, large onions, all contain much carbohydrate, 
and, in strict dieting, ought to be forbidden, except as an occa- 
sional variation in food. 

The principles to be adopted in framing a permanent dietary are 
to approximate the allowance of food to physiological requirements 
or slightly below, and to keep the protein well up to the standard 
allowance. In no case must the protein be reduced below the 
amount required for a person of average height and weight, lest the 
muscles be wasted; on the other hand, everything should be done 
to spare the muscular tissues, to harden them if possible, and enabk- 
them to resist the emaciation which we desire to bring about else- 
where. Very much good can be done by cutting down the " extras." 
An ounce of sugar yields as much energy as \ ounce of butter or 
meat fat, or i| ounces of roast beef, or 2 ounces of bread. Four or 
five lumps of sugar weigh an ounce, and contain 27 grammes of 
assimilable carbohydrate; if this quantity is taken daily, in excess 
of the requirements, it might lead to an accumulation of 11 pounds 
of fat in the body in a year. It is therefore an absolute necessity 
to limit the consumption of carbohydrates, fat, and alcohol. 

Physical exercise must be insisted on. It may be argued that it 
will increase the appetite for food. In spite of this, it is abso- 
lutely necessary to rearrange the habits. The sedentary man 
must take more exercise in the form of walking, golfing, tennis, 
bowls, rowing, swimming, or gymnastic exercises. Six or seven 
miles walk a day is not too much for a man of business; it should 
be done in sections — e.g., walking to and from the office; or walking 
a mile six or seven times a day. Golf is an excellent mode of 
exercising the body. Tennis and badminton are suitable for 
persons under forty years of age; croquet is better for ladies over 
forty, and golf is still better, if there is no definite heart weakness. 
The Schott exercises and other simple muscular movements^ are 
better for persons with heart weakness. Swimming and bathing 
are very efficient means of reducing or keeping the weight down. 
Everybody cannot bear prolonged immersion in cool water; such 
people may be recommended a Turkish or Russian bath once or 
twice a week, combined with general massage. Spa treatment is 
good for many patients; an annual course at Harrogate,Xarlsbad, 
Marienbad, and similar places will reduce hydrgemia and plethora, 
and stimulate the functions of metabolism.

CHAPTER XV 

DIABETES MELLITUS 

The most conspicuous signs of this disease are polyphagia, poly- 
dipsia, pol3-uria, and glycosuria. Blumenthal defines diabetes 
mellitus as the excretion of glucose in the urine due to an inability 
of the organism to utilize carbohydrates containing six atoms of 
carbon or multiples of the same. But the sugar is not always 
glucose (dextrose) ; it may be levulose, lactose, maltose, or pentose. 
Pentosuria is rare and usually hereditary. Levulosuria occurs in 
metallic poisoning. Lactosuria as well as glycosuria occurs during 
pregnancy, but rarel}^ in other cases. Diabetes mellitus has been 
attributed to manj^ causes; but it is impossible to put all cases down 
to one cause alone, and in some cases several causes contribute to 
the disease. 

Alimentary Glycosuria may be produced in healthy persons by 
the consumption of 300 to 500 grammes of glucose. Pavy^ con- 
sidered the theory that sugar enters the system by osmosis or 
diffusion is wTong. He believed all sugar derived from food is 
locked up in large protein molecules, or attached as a side-chain to 
such molecules, and is taken up by the lymphocytes of the intestinal 
mucosa. According to him glycosuria results from a failure of carbo- 
hydrates to become linked to the proteins, through the absence of 
an amboceptor supplied by the pancreas. In alimentary glycosuria 
the power of carrying sugar is normal, but the consumption is 
excessive; in senile glycosuria this power is slightly diminished 
with advancing age; in diabetes mellitus the sugar-carrying power 
is decidedly diminished. 

Hepatic Diabetes. — Claude Bernard, who established the theory 
of the glycogenic function of the liver, believed diabetes mellitus 
was due to a disturbance of that function. This theory has met 
much opposition, although recent observations have shown that 
the liver is decidedly at fault in many cases of diabetes. 

Pancreatic Diabetes. — An animal becomes glycosuric a few hours 
after removal of the pancreas. This organ is often diseased in 
diabetes mellitus. The pancreas normally supplies a ferment, 
which assists the liver to convert sugar to glycogen and store it in 
the cells. The internal secretion of the pancreas hinders the pro- 
duction of sugar in the liver, and the internal secretion of the supra- 
renal bodies increases it. When the pancreas is diseased, the

468 



CAUSES OF DIABETES 469 

enzyme is deficient; hyperglycsemia and glycosuria occur as a 
consequence. 

Suprarenal Diabetes.-- -The injection of adrenalin or a watery 
extract of suprarenal l)odies into the circulation of a normal person 
causes hyperglycsemia and glycosuria. The suprarenal bodies 
constantly provide an internal secretion which influences the 
carbohydrate metabolism, by causing the mobilization of glycogen 
and its transformation to sugar. Stimulation of the chromaffin 
system increases this effect. In Addison's disease the secretion 
of adrenalin is defective, and not only is there a deficiency of sugar 
in the blood, but glycosuria cannot be produced artiticially. In 
Grawitz's tumour, on the other hand, an increased secretion of 
adrenalin might be expected, and it is reported that glycosuria 
occurs in this disease, whence it is concluded that some cases of 
diabetes are due to adrenalin?emia. 

The Thyroid and Glycosuria. — In Graves's disease, and when 
patients are taking thyroid extract, glycosuria may occur sponta- 
neously; but in myxoedema and after thyroidectomy it is difficult 
to cause glycosuria. It is probable that some cases of diabetes are 
due to hyperthyroidism. It has been suggested that the pancreas 
supplies an amboceptor necessary to fix the glycogen in the liver 
and muscles, and the thyroid inhibits its production; when the thy- 
roid is too active, the pancreas is inhibited, the glycogen is not 
stored, and glycosuria occurs. The pituitary body has a similar 
influence on carbohydrate metabolism, and diabetes occurs in 
acromegaly. 

The Nervous System and Glycosuria. — The occurrence of glyco- 
suria after puncture of the medullary floor indicates the existence 
of a nervous centre controlling the glycogenic function. Moreover, 
puncture of the medullary floor does not cause glycosuria if the 
splanchnic nerves have been previously cut, showing that the 
nervous impulses are modified by passage through the sympathetic 
ganglia or chromaffin system. Experiments on the nervous system 
give support to those physicians whose treatment of diabetes is 
directed towards a betterment of the nervous organization by the 
use of drugs such as arsenic, uranium nitrate, opium and its salts, 
and a general tonic regime. 

The theory of multiple causes serves to explain many cases 
otherwise inexplicable. Sir J. Rose Bradford says " diabetes is 
not an entity, but a clinical label attached to a number of different 
conditions with varied origins, different morbid anatomy, and 
liable to follow different courses." 

Acetonuria, Acidosis, and Diabetic Coma. — These arise from the 
defective metabolism of fat ; the fat does not undergo com- 
plete oxidation to COo and water; some remains in the stages of 
/3-hydroxy-butyric acid, diacetic acid, and acetone. The carbo- 
hydrates were at one time believed a cause of acidosis; but the 
contrary is the fact. A sudden and complete withdrawal of carbo- 
hydrates gives rise to nausea, vomiting, rapid loss of flesh, the 



470 'DIABETES MELLITUS 

odour of acetone in the breath, acetone bodies in the urine, increase 
of ammonia, and sometimes coma. If the patient is now given 
some carbohydrates, the symptoms will disappear. This effect 
follows the consumption of ordinary carbohydrate foods; but 
galactose, lovulose, glycerine, lactic acid, tartaric acid, and citric 
acid definitely inhibit the production of acetone bodies. Aceto- 
nuria and acidosis are especially liable to follow a strict diabetic or 
carboh3'drate-free diet, insufficiency of food, excess of fat or protein. 

The Diet for Diabetes Mellitus— (i) Carbohydrate-free or Strict 
Diabetic Diet.- — It is beneficial for a diabetic person to follow definite 
rules. It was formerly considered that if the glycogenic function 
is suspended and the body unable to use carbohydrates in diabetes, 
it is useless or injurious to force them on the body. Home was the 
first to employ alkalies and animal food alone with a view to a 
specific action. But the first acquisition of clinical knowledge 
respecting carbohydrate-free diet was obtained by RoUo in 1830. 
But nowada^'s nobody prescribes a strict diabetic diet; few people 
can endure for 3'ears a diet consisting only of animal food, cabbage, 
and salad. Experience has shown that such a diet does not cure 
diabetes, although it produces a temporary reduction of glycosuria. 
It is often followed by acidosis, acetonuria, and sometimes diabetic 
coma. 

This diet differs from the Salisbury diet by containing much fat, it 
is less monotonous, and may consist of any of the following articles: 

Meat. — It may consist of fat and lean meat of all kinds — fresh, 
dried, salted, or smoked; ,and boiled, baked, roasted, grilled, 
minced, or dressed with spices. It may be derived from domestic 
or wild animals: oxen, sheep, deer, antelopes, horses, pigs, hares, 
rabbits, or birds. All organs may .be eaten, except the liver. The 
condiments allowable are salt, vinegar, mustard, pepper, cayenne 
pepper, horseradish, capers, and pickles (especially piclded cabbage, 
cucumber, kidney or snap beans, cauliflower, onions, walnuts, 
sauerkraut), and a small quantity of piccalilli or chutney. 

Soups and broths of every kind which do not contain carbo- 
hydrates. They may be made of any animal substance, except 
the liver — e.g., ox-tail soup, bone soup, mutton broth, veal broth, 
chicken broth, game soup, oyster soup, snail soup, bisque soup; 
soup made of eggs, milk, or cream, and extract of meat; essence of 
beef, meat juice, and extracts of meat. The soup must not be 
thickened with flour, oatmeal, maize, lentils, bean-flour, pea-flour, 
barley, rice, vermicelli, macaroni, peas, beans, or other farinaceous 
material. It may be flavoured with mint, thyme, marjoram, 
savory, basil, bay-leaf, parsley, green celery, leek, onion, garlic, 
shallot, chives, cloves, allspice, pepper, cayenne pepper, salt, 
mushroom, morel, truffles; and turnips, carrots, or swedes (pro- 
viding the latter are removed after being boiled). 

Fish. — All kinds of marine or fresh-water fish may be eaten 
fresh, dried, salted, smoked, or made into paste, providing no 
starchy or other carbohydrate substance is used. The condiments 



CARBOHYDRATE-FREE DIET 471 

which may be used with hsh are salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, 
vinegar, lemon juice, butter, salad oil; mayonnaise consisting of 
salad oil, egg, and vinegar; anchovy sauce, prepared crab, lobster 
sauce; boiled cucumber, spinach, sorrel, fennel, or parsley. But 
no sauce can be allowed which contains flour, cornflour, arrowroot, 
sugar, or other carbohydrate. 

Shellfish and all animals in shells may be eaten — e.g., crab, lob- 
ster, clams, oysters, mussels, snails, shrimps, prawns, and echino- 
derms. The liver, of course, contains glycogen ; therefore the " inside " 
of lobster, crab, and the liver of oysters, etc., should be forbidden. 

Eggs may be given in any form known to the cook, except com- 
bined with flour, starch, sugar, etc. 

Milk, Cream, Butter. — The amount of cream and butter should 
be unlimited; but milk should only be allowed in sufftcient quantity 
to flavour tea or coffee, or to make certain confections. Junket, 
milk jelly, eg^ custard, egg-snow, eg^ souffle, whipped cream, etc., 
should be sweetened with saccharin. 

Jelly made from meat, cow-heel, gelatin, isinglass, agar-agar, 
and Iceland or Irish moss may be allowed; they may be sweetened 
with saccharin. 

Cheese. — Most varieties may be eaten when ripe. 

Vegetables. — The diabetic person loses daily a large quantity of 
mineral substances in his urine; this loss should be made good by 
the consumption of vegetables. Cabbage and all other Brassicce, 
when quite green, are recommended. Turnip-tops, beet-chard, 
celery-tops, spinach, green beans, endive, lettuce, watercress, 
radishes, cucumber, vegetable marrow, pumpkin, squash, mush- 
rooms, green artichokes, Jerusalem artichokes, turnips, mustard 
and cress, green onions, sorrel, and dandelion leaves, are allowed 
for most cases. Cooked vegetables should be boiled in a large 
amount of water. 

Nuts. — Brazil nuts, butternuts, almonds, filberts, walnuts, 
peccans, pine-nuts, and roasted peanuts are allowed in moderation. 
Chestnuts are forbidden. 

Fruit which contains less than 5 per cent, of carbohydrate may 
be allowed in moderation, unless very strict dieting is attempted — 
e.g., olives, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, bilberries, and 
an occasional apple, pear, orange, or plum. 

Beverages. — Pure water, distilled water, or aerated water (Puralis, 
Salutaris), is the best beverage. Tea, coffee free from chicory, 
cocoa made from nibs, mate, and guarana, are allowed. They may 
be sweetened with saccharin, flavoured with cream or lemon. The 
patient also may have beverages made of juice of lemons and limes, 
citric acid, tartaric acid, or cream of tartar; unsweetened soda, 
potash, or other mineral waters; and the alkaline waters of Vichy, 
Vals, Ems, Royat, Carlsbad, or Contrexeville. A little un- 
sweetened gin, whisky, brandy, dry sauterne, Chablis, hock, 
Moselle, or Burgundy, may be taken. 

Forbidden Foods. — Liver, inside of crabs and lobsters, cockles, 



472 DIABETES MELLITUS 

mussels; sausage, polony, black pudding, and commercial pastes of 
fish, fowl, meat, shrimps, etc. (they usually contain liver and a pro- 
portion of bread or hour). Jelly containing sugar. Bread and 
cakes of every kind and form; biscuits; confections, such as 
meringue, marzipan, royal icing. Pastr}-, milk puddings, and cereal 
or farinaceous foods. Potatoes, sweet potatoes, 3'ams, beetroots, 
carrots, parsnips; blanched vegetables — e.g., white heart of cabbage, 
cauliflower, broccoli, celery, onions, seakale, salsify, scorzonera; 
green peas, kidney or snap beans, broad beans, and asparagus. 
Sweet fruits — e.g., grapes, oranges, melons, tomatoes, pears, apples, 
mulberries, cherries, plums, etc. Jam, marmalade, preserves, 
crystallized fruit, preserved ginger, guava jelly or marmalade, fruit 
jelly, honey, treacle, sugar, and chestnuts. Beer, ale, stout, porter, 
sweet wines, liqueurs, syrups, prepared cocoa, coffee with chicory 
or other adulterants, sweet mineral waters, and other beverages 
containing sugar or dextrin. 

Effects of Carbohydrate-free Diet. — /;/ moderate cases the excretion 
of sugar diminishes at once, and ceases in less than a week; but the 
total excretion of nitrogen rises, the ammonia increases, and the 
urine may give a reaction for diacetic acid and acetone. In severe 
cases the urine is not rendered sugar-free; the patient continues to 
excrete sugar manufactured from fat or protein. In a few days the 
urine gives a deeper reaction for diacetic acid, the nitrogen excretion 
rises, indications of acute acidosis soon appear, and there is a risk 
of coma after ten or fourteen days' use of the diet. 

(2) Modified Ordinary Diet. — Failure of the strict diabetic, or carbo- 
h3'drate-free diet, to prevent the excretion of sugar has caused that 
method of treatment to be almost entirely abandoned. The diet should 
be arranged after the use of test-meals. The existence of sugar in the 
urine to the extent of ci or 0-2 per cent, needs antidiabetic diet. 
If the total daily excretion of sugar is less than 70 grammes 
(2| ounces), it is a mild case; if it exceeds 70 grammes, it is a severe 
case, probably complicated by acetonuria. Ihe following test of 
toleration is safe: Let the patient take the diet he is accustomed to 
for three days; during this period all his food must be carefully 
W'cighed, and the amount of carbohydrate calculated from the 
tables of composition. On the third day, let all the urine be 
collected, mixed, and measured; the percentage and total sugar 
excreted should be estimated. The patient's tolerance of carbo- 
hydrates is the carbohydrate in the food minus the sugar in the 
urine. If the patient excretes more sugar than he consumes, he has 
no tolerance- — he has the disease in a severe form. If the patient 
has been in the habit of consuming 250 grammes of carbohydrates, 
and he excretes 220 grammes of sugar daily, his tolerance for 
carbohydrates is only 30 grammes. Alkalies should now be given 
dail}^ and the carboh3'drate gradually reduced until the sugar dis- 
appears from the urine; if this is done slowly, the glycosuria may 
disappear when the carbohydrate reaches 70 grammes. This diet 
should be maintained for a time, perhaps for two months. If the 



MOOT FT FID ORDINARY DIET 473 

glycosuria does not return, the carbohydrate may now be increased 
gradually until the sugar reappears. The actual tolerance is 
somewhere between the points at which the glycosuria goes and 
reappears. The carbohydrate must be varied until the actual 
tolerance of carbohydrate is reached, and the allowance fixed at 
10 grammes below it. Some carbohydrate foods cause a greater 
excretion of sugar than others; but the tolerance for each food can 
be tested in turn, until a dietary suitable for the patient is built up. 

The Total Allowance of Food. — Many patients have an enormous 
appetite and great thirst. But it is unnecessary for them to have 
a great bulk of food, providing it is of the right kind. The hunger 
of a diabetic patient is due to his inability to utilize sugar, and, in a 
large proportion of cases, to the consumption of foods which are 
useless to him — e.g., bread and other starchy foods. Hunger is 
moderated by proper food, but is never appeased by consuming 
an unlimited amount of improper food. A number of observa- 
tions were made on diabetic persons by Pautz,^ who arrived at the 
conclusion that the total energy requirement does not vary from that 
of a healthy individual; but an allowance should be made for the 
sugar lost in the urine. If a man excretes 70 to 100 grammes of 
sugar daily — i.e., a loss of 287 to 410 calories, sufficient animal food 
should be given to cover the loss. The weight of diabetic persons 
ought to be maintained with an allow^ance of 40 to 45 calories per 
kilo of bodv-weight. An excess of food should be avoided, because 
the digestive and metabolic functions are liable to be disturbed 
thereby and the system laden with the products of imperfect 
metabolism. 

The Protein Requirement. — If a diabetic person consumes an 
ordinary mixed diet, he requires a larger amount of protein and 
fat, for the simple reason that he is unable to utilize the normal 
amount of carbohydrate. The metabolism of proteins is the same 
in diabetic and normal persons — that is to say, the nitrogen balance 
is kept in equilibrium with equal quantities. If it is desired to 
determine the amount of protein needed by any patient, it can be 
done by finding out how much nitrogen is excreted. Protein 
=N X 6-25 ; and meat in general (beef, mutton, game, fowl, fish, 
etc.) contains yi per cent, of nitrogen. If the urine contains 
16 grammes of nitrogen daily, the protein required is 16 x 625 
= 100 grammes per diem; and this amount of protein would be 
contained in (16 x 100) -=-3-2 = 500 grammes, or 17^ ounces of meat. 

The total amount of food, however, must be enough to meet the 
calorific requirements or expenditure of energy; and it may be 
necessary to make up any deficiency with animal food. Sufficient 
reasons have been given for the abandonment of the carbohydrate- 
free diet. One important reason must be insisted on: It is probable 
that the only source of muscular potential energy is a carbohydrate, 
and if it is not contained in the food, it must be manufactured in 
the organism out of protein or fat; 40 grammes of sugar may be 

1 Zelt. /. Biol., iSg5, xxii. 206-238. 



474 DIABETES MELLITUS 

produced from lOO grammes of protein. But the call for sugar 
often leads to the manufacture of more than the organism can 
utilize; consequently the urine may contain sugar when there is none 
in the food. Diabetic persons should not be allowed more than 
i6o to i8o grammes of protein a day, although some authorities 
fix the upper limit at 200 grammes. Excess of animal food is 
particularly contra-indicated in old age, gouty diabetes, albumin- 
uria; and in those cases where nitrogenous food increases the 
glycosuria more than a limited amount of carbolwdrate does. 

The Allowance of Fat. — It is usual to allow an unlimited quantity 
of fat to help the consumption of a large amount of green vegetables, 
and to make good the deficiency of food due to the withdrawal 
of carbohydrate. It is believed that the consumption of alcohol — 
first-class wine or spirit — promotes the digestion and absorption of 
fat, and reduces the risks of lipaemia and acidosis. When thus 
assisted, the assimilation of fat by diabetics is normal. Strauss^ 
gave a diabetic the following diet for thirty-three days: Meat 
12 J ounces, bacon 3 J ounces, butter 5| ounces, salad 5 ounces, 
sauerkraut 5 ounces, whisky i| ounces, and oil i ounce. It con- 
tained 280 grammes of fat, and was practicahy carbohydrate-free; 
an examination of the fasces showed 92 per cent, was absorbed. 

The consumption of a large quantity of fat should be encouraged. 
But it may be injurious; therefore the physician should keep a 
look out for acidosis and acetonuria. Acetone bodies arise from 
the defective metabolism of fat. Acetonaemia can be produced 
in healthy persons by cutting off carbohydrates; if fat is then given, 
the acetonaemia will increase, but if sugar be given instead, it will 
cease. The same occurs in diabetics. Moreover, butter, cheese, 
and cream increase the acetone bodies more than other fats. 
Therefore when a fatty diet is followed by acetonuria, acidosis, 
lipaemia, orlipoidsemia. the total amount of fat in the food ought to 
be reduced; the patient should only be allowed fat meat, bacon, 
ham, eggs, margarine, and oil ; and butter, cream, and cheese should 
be prohibited until acetonuria ceases or is much diminished. 

The Carhohydyatc Allowance. — A complete abstinence from carbo- 
hydrates compels the organism to utilize or eliminate the harmful 
reserves of sugar and rests the glycogenic functions. Under such 
treatment the glycogenic function may improve and the patient's 
tolerance for carbohydrates rise in two months from 30 to 80 or 
even 100, grammes daily. The degree of tolerance may also be 
improved by judicious muscular exercise. But it has been shown 
that the carbohydrate-free diet does not prevent acetonuria and 
acidosis. The reason is due to the fact that the metabolism of fat, 
as well as carbohydrate, is defective. Moreover, the potential 
energy of the muscles is constantly and without variability derived 
from carboh3-drate. Therefore carbohydrate is essential, and 
protects the muscles from wasting in proportion to the degree of 

1 " Ein Beitrag zur Keiitnibs der Fcttrcsorption in Diabetes Mellitus," 
i., p. 14, Strassburg, 1893. 



PHYSIOLOGICAL REQUIREMENrS 475 

tulcration. The amount of energy expended in ordinary muscular 
work is about 450 to 550 calories per diem ; and this would be supplied 
by about 100 granmies of carbohydrate. This rule, therefore, may 
be stated: The supply of carbohydrates should he gradually cut down 
until it is merely sufflcient to provide energy for the muscular work — 
viz., 100 grammes daily. If the nutrition and weight of the body 
are maintained, if the sugar in the urine does not increase, and if 
acetone bodies are absent from the urine, that quantity of carbo- 
hydrate should be allowed daily. When the degree of tolerance 
is less than 100 grammes daily, the carbohydrate may be reduced 
below that amount if means are adopted, such as rest in bed, to 
reduce the mechanical or muscular work of the body; but the effect 
must be carefully watched. If the patient is on a diet equal to his 
carbohydrate tolerance, he may live indefinitely without glycosuria; 
but when the carbohydrate is above his tolerance, a part of it will 
be eliminated in the urine, and part retained in the cells of his 
tissues. In an ordinary case of diabetes there is some power of 
utilizing carbohydrates, there is no loss of nutrition, the nitrogen 
balance is maintained, and the sugar in the urine is derived from 
the food alone. In severe cases there is little power of utilizing 
carbohydrates; the organism loses weight, the tissues are succes- 
sively destroyed, the nitrogen balance is upset, the organism cannot 
utilize the carbohydrates manufactured from the proteins or fat of 
his food or tissues; the sugar eliminated exceeds the carbohydrate 
consumed, it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and is 
probably attended by acetonuria. 

The selection of carbohydrate food should not be limited to 
bread, potatoes, rice, peas, or oatmeal; if the table on p. 476 is 
properly used, the patient's diet can be varied from day to day, and 
the consumption of carbohydrate gauged fairly well. A much larger 
variety of foods may be used by reference to the table of com- 
positions (pp. 9-20) in the Introductory chapter. Torrefied bread, 
bottom crust, and toast have some of their starch converted to 
dextrin; but it is a fallacy to suppose they are better adapted than 
ordinary bread for diabetics; they are concentrated carbohydrate 
foods. Diabetic breads should be carefully scrutinized; the pro- 
portion of carbohydrate in them ought to be known; if it is unknown 
or variable, they should be forbidden. Gluten flour should contain 
35 per cent, of protein; but it is never free from carbohydrate; 
Kraus of Carlsbad asserts that only three out of nineteen specimens 
of gluten bread analyzed contained less than 30 per cent, of starch; 
five contained 30 to 40, four from 40 to 50, two from 50 to 60, 
and four over 60, per cent, of starch. Cakes made of almond 
flour, grated Brazil nuts, cocoanut, soy beans, and proteins 
are valuable. Various recipes for their preparation are sent out 
with Aleuronat, Glidine, Roborat, Protene, Plasmon, and other 
protein foods which are useful to the diabetic. Some confectioners 
manufacture diabetic cakes, biscuits, and bread, which are guaran- 
teed to be starch-free and sugar-free.

The Potato Cure. — Ripe potatoes contain i9'5, new or unripe 
potatoes 15, per cent, of carbohydrate. Now, 100 grammes of 
carbohydrate are contained in about 19 ounces of potato, or 6| 
ounces of wliite bread, or 5I ounces of dry toast, 'therefore it is 
more rational to allow potato than bread. Moreover, potatoes are 
bulky, they will take up a considerable amount of tat, and are 
suitable as the chief source of carbohydrate. Dujardin-Beaumetz 
said they cause a smaller excretion of sugar than an isodynamical 
quantity of bread, and he considered them superior to gluten 
bread. Strauss also found them better tolerated than bread. 
Mosse used potatoes as a " cure " for diabetes, prescribing 2 J to 
3 J pounds daily; in nineteen out of 20 cases the glycosuria was 
reduced, thirst diminished, and there was improvement of the 
general condition. These results were chiefly due to potassium 
salts. Sawyer prescribed a cake made of potato flour, bran, yeast, 
eggs, and butter. Sternberg recommended that the potatoes should 
be deprived of as much starch as possible. This may be done by 
reducing them to a pulp, throwing it upon a linen strainer, and 
washing out the starch by a stream of water. Ihe residue will 
contain much less starch than boiled potatoes, and it can be used 
for preparing many dishes.

VARIOUS CURES 477 

Arlichnkcs and Jerusalem ar/icliokcs contain inulin, but no starcli; 
late in the year they also contain levulose. Chinese artichokes 
(Siachys tuherifera) and dahlia tubers also contain inulin. All these 
are suitable foods for the diabetic. Inulin is a gummy substance 
yielding levulose on hydrolysis; but it is doubtful whether levulose 
is produced from it in the alimentary canal. When starving animals 
are fed with levulose, it increases the glycogen in the liver; but 
inulin has not the same effect; hence it is doubtful whether inulin 
is a useful food. Levulose, to the extent of i^ ounces a day, 
is tolerated better than ordinary sugar; but not by every patient. 

The Oatmeal Care. — Oatmeal contains 67 '5 per cent, of carbo- 
hydrate — i.e., 8 or 10 per cent, less than wheaten flour. But the 
lole.yation of oatmeal in many cases is twice as great as that of bread; 
it should be tested in each case. It may be given in porridge, 
pudding, and cake. Von Noorden's " oatmeal cure " consists of 
porridge made in the following proportions: Oatmeals, albumin 2, 
butter 6, parts. Each meal may consist of i ounce oatmeal, i ounce 
butter, and two eggs. But the eggs may be replaced by Aleuronat, 
Roborat, Glidine, etc. A little cognac, whisky, wine, or coffee, may 
be allowed, but no other food. It is beneficial in many cases; but 
it should not be continued too long at one time, lest diarrhoea, 
nausea, cedema of the legs, or other signs of discomfort arise. It 
ma}' be given in alternation with other " cures "• — e.g., after two or 
three days of strict carbohydrate-free diet, the patient may have 
three or four days of the oatmeal cure, then the potato cure, or two 
01 three days of turnips, butter, and greens, and so on, in a cycle. 
Irish moss, Iceland moss, dulse, salep, and agar-agar, are useful 
foods in many cases. 

The Personal EQuation. — The food which suits one patient ad- 
mirably may be bad for another. Oatmeal, potatoes, rice, macaroni, 
fruit, milk, dextrose, levulose, saccharose, lactose, etc., may each 
be tolerated better than the others. There is a personal equation 
for the utilization of sugar, and there is also a personal equation 
with regard to starch and fat. It is only by careful analysis of the 
urine after the addition of a fresh food that we can gauge its toler- 
ance and effects. 

Milk ill Diabetes.- — On account of its lactose, milk has been ex- 
cluded from the diet by many authorities. Bouchardat forbade its 
use in all cases, except when there is albuminuria, some visceral 
lesion, or threatened uraemia. Donkin prescribed skim milk alone 
for weeks together, and Winternitz claims to have cured many 
diabetics by milk alone. Its value depends on the toleration for 
lactose. In ordinary dieting, it is unnecessary to forbid the use 
of enough milk to flavour tea or other beverages; i ounce of milk 
contains only 075 gramme (11 grains) of lactose. Cream is always 
allowed, but it should not be forgotten that it contains as much 
lactose as milk docs. Sugar-free milk can be obtained from Callard 
and Callard of London; but a solution of casein in water, with some 
cream added to it, is a good substitute, and nearlj' sugar-free. 
Almond milk may also be used. 



478 DIABETES MELLITUS 

Artificial Suhsiiiufcs for Sugar.- — The food of diabetic persons may 
be sweetened by saccharin, saxin, dulcin, sucrole, etc. These 
substances have no food value; they do not spare the tissues, nor 
yield energy. Man}' diabetics become accustomed to unsweetened 
food; others crave for sweets. Dj'spepsia and neuralgia in the solar 
plexus occur when saccharin, etc., are used to excess; and it may be 
injurious to the kidne\'s. 

Alcohol in Diabetes.- — The patient should not have malt liquors 
or sweet wines. He ma}' have pure whisky, cognac brand}', un- 
sweetened gin, dry wines^ — e.g., sauterne, Chablis, and Burgundy. 
Champagne sans sucre contains only 20 grains of sugar in i quart — 
about I per cent. ; Rhine wine and hock may be obtained contain- 
ing only 0'004 to 0'i5 per cent, of sugar. A limited amount of 
alcohol is valuable; it replaces fat and carbohydrate as a source 
of energ}' and protector of protein, and assists the absorption of 
fat. 1 he amount may range from 2 to 5 ounces of whisky or brandy, 
or from 10 to 20 ounces of wine daily, according to its strength. 

Severe Diabetes. — This may be divided into two classes: {a) With- 
out acetomiria.- — If there is sugar in the urine when the carbohydrate 
is reduced to 70 grammes daily, there probably would be sugar with 
carbohydrate-free diet. Let the patient be given a test diet con- 
sisting of 18 or 20 ounces of cooked meat (or 8 ounces of meat and 
three eggs), 2 pints of sugar- free milk, 4 ounces of carbohydrate- 
free bread (Caseoid, gluten, Protene, etc.), with plenty of butter, 
boiled greens, and salad. If there is no diminution of sugar in the 
urine, it is useless to give a strict diet ; the power to utilize sugar is 
very deficient. The amount of carbohydrate to be allowed in such 
a case must depend on the general condition, the nutrition, loss of 
weight, and proportion of sugar in the urine. It may be necessary 
to restrict the consumption of protein as well as carbohydrate. One 
food after another should be tried, until a list is obtained which 
causes the patient to excrete the smallest amount of sugar. 

{h) With Acetonuria. — In these cases there is defective metab- 
olism of fat, carbohydrate, and protein; it is therefore absurd to 
prescribe animal food and greens to the exclusion of starch and 
sugar. As a matter of fact the excretion of sugar in these cases 
is very little influenced by diet, and we should be satisfied if the 
glycosuria can be kept within moderate limits — e.g., the excretion 
of 100 grammes of sugar daily. Any change of food must be brought 
about gradually; a sudden change would accentuate the acetoncemia, 
and might precipitate coma. The following dietary may be useful: 

Breakfast. — Tea or coflEee with thick cream; fat ham or bacon and two 
eggs; 2 ounces of brown bread, plenty of butter. 

Midday Meal. — Clear soup, containing beef marrow; boiled or broiled fish, 
with butter; fat meat, game, poultrj^- boiled vegetables and butter; 2 ounces 
of bread, butter, ripe cheese; whisky and alkaline-water. 

Teatime. — A cup of tea or coffee with cream; diabetic cakes of almond, 
cocoanut, etc., i ounce. 

Evening Meal. — Hot or cold meat, fish, or eggs; boiled vegetables and 
butter; 2 ounces of bread-and-butter, cheese; whisky and alkaline-water. 



SEVERE DIABETES 479 

The bread, cakes, and vegct.ibles may be reckoned as 7 ounces 
of bread, containing 100 grammes of carbohydrate. A pound of 
potatoes would contain al)out the same quantity of carbohydrate, 
and should now and then be eaten in place of bread; or bread and 
potatoes may be both used up to the limit. The patient must not 
be allowed to overfeed himself. Hunger is due to loss of sugar; 
thirst to polyuria. It is better for the patient to suffer hunger than 
run the risks of coma from acidosis. In mild cases of diabetes fat 
is borne well throughout its course; but in severe cases the oxida- 
tion of fat fails, the sugar manufactured from it is not utilized, and 
the fatty acids are not wholly oxidized to CO2 and water. In many 
cases butter and other fats containing butyric acid are badly borne, 
and their use must be restricted, 'i he fat of eggs and milk is usually 
well tolerated. When people cannot afford a large amount of animal 
food, milk is for them the best source of protein and fat; and it 
may be pointed out that 4 pints of milk contain 103 grammes of 
carbohydrate. 

It should be observed that acetonuria does not mean the case is 
hopeless; many patients live for years after its appearance. 
W'cintraud says it is only dangerous when the metabolism of 
nitrogen becomes disturbed. But it necessitates the allowance of 
more carbohydrate, and a simultaneous reduction of fat and pro- 
tein. An attempt should be made to re-establish the equilibrium 
of the nitrogen balance; to do this, it may be necessary to reduce 
the protein to 100, 80, or even 60, grammes daily. The amount 
of fat must be reduced, tempoiarily at any rate, and butter, cream, 
cheese, or other articles containing volatile fatty acids, must be 
excluded from the diet. 1 he amount of carbohydrate to be allowed 
cannot be fixed; it must depend on its effects. Nobody doubts 
the value of carbohydrates and their ability to relieve the symptoms 
of acidosis; but the ultimate good of the increased allowance is 
doubted. The lowest quantity of carbohydrate which will prevent 
acetonuria is 72 grammes daily; it n^ever increases acetonuria. 
always tends to check it, but it is very likelj- to increase glycosuria. 
The acetone bodies arise from too strict dieting of the diabetic; the 
food does not contain enough carbohydrate for muscular energy, 
it is manufactured from protein and fat, and when the metabolism of 
fat is defective, acidosis occurs, and the patient is liable to coma. 

Milk is an exceedingly useful food in severe cases. Its lactose is 
valuable, and often tolerated better than other carbohydrates. 
There may be an increased glycosuria after taking milk, in respect of 
which there is a fallacy, which was exposed by Voit, as follows: A 
diabetic person was strictly dieted until the sugar in his urine was 
very low. He was then given 100 grammes of lactose daily, and the 
glycosuria at once increased; biU the excreted sugar was not lactose ; 
it was glucose [dextrose) derived from the proteins and fats. Lactose 
is utilized more easily than dextrose in these cases; therefore when 
milk is consumed, a quantity of glucose corresponding to the con- 
sumed lactose may be excreted. 



480 DIABETES MELLITUS 

The oatmeal cvire of Von Xoorden is very good in some cases 
of acetonuria. The potato cure ma}' also be tried. Strauss found 
100 grammes of bread is equal to 200 grammes of oatmeal or 300 
grammes of potato in causing glycosuria. As a " cure," 3 pounds 
of potatoes daily are recommended by Strauss, Mosse, and others, 
no other carbohydrate being allowed. In many cases of diabetes 
I pound of potatoes would be sufficient. When the full amount 
is eaten, a rapid reduction of acetonuria is observed. Potatoes 
may be utilized as a means of introducing fat ; they nia.y be taken 
as " fried chips," fat being used in cooking. 

Vegetarian Diet for Severe Diabetes. — The starch and other carbo- 
hydrates of vegetables are contained in cellulose envelopes, and, 
excepting where the cellulose is arranged in thin layers, alternating 
with amylose or granulose, man}' vegetables are not very quickly 
digested. The fibres of many plants are coated with ligno-cellulose, 
and this substance increases with the age of the plant. Cellulose 
consists largely of dextran, a polymer of dextrose. Iceland moss 
consists mainly of hemicelluloses, of which dextran is the chief; 
Irish moss and agar-agar consist chiefly of the hemicellulose 
called galactan ; the Turkish salep of mannan ,■ and dulse of a 
mixture of pentosans. These celluloses and hemicelluloses are 
digested by man with extreme slowness; they yield dextrin, dex- 
trose, galactose, and mannose. It has been shown that toleration 
of carbohydrates is in proportion to their slowness of digestion, 
and galactose is tolerated better than dextrose. The above-named 
substances are all of very low food value, and afford very little 
nourishment to the body. It is idle to say they are useless. Diges- 
tion experiments show a relatively small absorption; but the fact 
remains that algae and lichens are staple foods for human beings 
in some regions of the earth. When boiled in water, they yield 
a gelatinous or gummy substance. They contain a bitter principle, 
which can be removed by washing the fronds in a weaK alkaline 
solution. 1 he material may then be dried, reduced to a powder, 
and used for making bread, cakes, and puddings. 

Ordinary lacto-vegetarian dietary is sometimes beneficial in 
severe diabetes: milk, potatoes, oatmeal, or other cereals and 
legumes (beans and peas). This is necessarily a low protein diet. 
The diminution of protein often increases the tolerance of carbo- 
hydrates. The patient is satisfied with less food^ — say, 25 calories 
per kilo, or a total of 1,600 to 1,800 calories daily. The reaction 
of the diet is alkaline; under its influence the urine becomes less 
acid, acetone bodies disappear, coma is warded off and the kidneys 
are spared. It has been shown that an excess of proteins increases 
glycosuria, that egg-albumin is tolerated best of all, and other 
proteins in the following order: Whole egg, vegetable proteins, 
milk proteins, and meat proteins, the latter being tolerated least of 
all. Therefore a diet consisting largely of nuts, beans, peas, fat 
bacon, cabbage, turnips, salads, and salad-oil, is as likely to give 
good results as a diet containing animal foods. 



ALKALINE TREATMENT 481 

Faf in Severe Cases. — Acetone bodies result from faulty me- 
tabolism of fat, and are immediately derived from the lower or 
volatile fatty acids. Butter, cream, and ripe cheese contain such 
acids, and in bad cases the patient should be forbidden to eat them. 
Eggs, beef fat, mutton fat, and salad-oil ma}- be allowed; they do 
not contain volatile fatty acids. Stern of Chicago prescribed 
10 to 40 egg-yolks daily; and Pollateschek ordered large quantities 
of meat fat as a cure for acctonuria. 

Rectal Injections of Glucose. — In cases where these foods do not 
relieve the symptoms of acidosis the carbohydrate should be 
injected into the colon. One ounce of glucose dissolved in 4 ounces 
of water should be injected two or three times a day. Under this 
treatment the acetonuria may entirely disappear, glycosuria di- 
minish, and the general condition improve. 

The Alkaline Treatment. — Alkalies are beneficial for acidosis 
and acetonuria. In bad cases from i to 2 ounces of bicarbonate 
of soda should be given daily, in doses of i to 2 drachms. The 
only contra-indication to its use is extremely rapid emaciation; in 
such cases it is prejudicial. Its effects should be closely watched 
in all cases — it may cause gastric disturbances, diarrhcea, and oedema 
of the extremities. There is no need to continue large doses of 
soda a long time ; when the urine becomes neutral, the dose may be 
reduced to ^ ounce a day. All alkalies act on the liver, encourage 
the storage of glycogen, check the output of sugar, increase the 
toleration of carbohydrates, abate the thirst, neutrahze acidity, 
and in some cases cause a disappearance of sugar and acetone from 
the urine. Alkalies should always be given when transferring a 
patient from one kind of diet to another, and particularly when 
the diet is poor in carbohydrate. Residence for a few weeks at 
Vichy, Carlsbad, Neuenahr, and other places where the water is 
strongly alkaline is often very beneficial, when associated with 
proper feeding. 

Diabetic Coma.— When there is marked acetonuria, sodium car- 
bonate should be given before meals, as directed above. If the 
patient is very drowsy, an intravenous injection of saline solution 
containing i or 2 per cent, of sodium carbonate may be used. The 
best mode of feeding a comatose patient is to wash out the rectum 
and inject a solution of dextrose and white of egg every few hours. 

Digestive Troubles. — Ordinary digestive derangements require 
the same treatment as in other people. But the gastric crises to 
which diabetics are subject are of very bad augury. The tongue be- 
comes foul, sometimes presenting a streak of black fur down the 
centre, the mouth dry, and the breath has an odour recalling that of 
chloroform ; the urine contains acetone, but not always diacetic 
acid. The crisis consists of a sudden pain in the abdomen, swelling, 
and eructation of gas, followed by nausea or vomiting, and some- 
times diarrhcea. Nausea renders oral feeding temporarily im- 
possible. The treatment consists of applying warmth to the 
abdomen, clearing out the bowels by enemata, and feeding with 

31 



482 DIABETES MELLITUS 

rectal injections of dextrose or levulose, and white of egg. The 
patient may drink an effervescing solution of sodium bicarbonate 
and tartaric acid with excess of soda. Apollinaris and other alka- 
line waters are beneficial. When the crisis is passing off, give 
milk, chicken broth, mutton broth, weak tea, brandy, and alkaline 
waters. The diet which the patient has been accustomed to may 
need readjusting. He must be put on foods which will be useful 
to a person with acetonuria. The predominance of animal foods 
should be checked ; foods containing cellulose or hemicellulose — 
e.g., inulin— may be given with advantage. Alkalies, alkaline waters, 
tartaric acid, citric acid, lemon-juice, or lime-juice should be given. 
" Bilious attacks " should in future be looked on with suspicion. 

Tuberculosis in Diabetes. — Post-mortem examinations sliow that 
tubercle complicates 30 to 40 per cent, of diabetes. When this 
complication exists, the diet must be abundant — viz., 35 to 45 
calories per kilo of body-weight, 2,500 to 3,300 calories per diem, 
and more than that if the patient performs manual labour. But 
the diabetic diet should be followed in most cases — that is to say, 
the allowance of carbohydrate should be within the degree of 
tolerance. Open-air treatment should not be enforced, unless the 
patient is living in a warm, dry climate. 

Gouty Diabetes. — This variety usually in volves^a disturbance of 
most of the metabolic functions. Ihe dietetic treatment should 
neither be that of typical gout nor diabetes. If the patient is put 
on a diet suitable for typical cases of either disease, he will go from 
bad to worse. The food must be of the ordinary kind, light, 
nourishing, such as would be suitable for cataiTh of the stomach. 
Ordinary bread, milk puddings, and vegetables must be allowed 
in moderation. Tender meat, fowl, and light fish must be pre- 
scribed in such quantities as their weakened organism can me- 
tabolize; a large amount would be injurious. A little dry cham- 
pagne, or well-matured port, containing a minimum of alcohol 
and ether, may be allowed. The object of treatment is to build 
up and nourish the enfeebled frame, strengthen the heart, stimu- 
late the metabolic glands, and encourage the physiological processes 
in general. The articles on Catarrh of the Stomach and Chronic 
Hyperaemia of the Liver should be read in this connection. Treat- 
ment at Harrogate, Bath, Llandindrod, Carlsbad, Marienbad, 
Neuenahr, etc., is useful. 

Albuminuria in Diabetes. — The cause of the albuminuria should 
be found and treated. It may originate in gouty diabetes, renal 
changes, arterio-sclerosis, alimentary toxaemia. The diet suitable 
for these conditions should be given as far as possible, taking care 
to keep the carbohydrate within the degree of tolerance. When 
the diabetes is of pancreatic origin, the occurrence of albuminuria 
does not require any change from the diabetic diet. When tube- 
casts and albuminuria become a constant feature in a case of 
diabetes, an occasion has risen for reconsideration of the diet. 
Milk is valuable for such cases. 



DIABETES INSIPIDUS 483 

Glycosuria daring Pregnancy. — Sugar occurs in tlic urine of 
niiiny women during pregnancy and lactation; it may be lactose 
or glucose, or both. It is sometimes due to genuine diabetes. The 
liver is very liable to be upset during pregnancy, and this may pro' 
duce hepatic diabetes. As a general rule it disappears under a 
mild antidiabetic diet. About 120 grammes of carbohydrate 
should be allowed — e.g., i pint of milk, 3 ounces of bread or toast, 
and 8 ounces of potato — with meat, hsh, eggs, and fresh vegetables. 
Frequent examinations of the urine should be made. 

Diabetes in Children. — This is frequently acute, and of pan- 
creatic origin. The treatment required does not differ essentially 
from that of adults. If the urine does not give a reaction for 
diacetic acid, the carbohydrates should be reduced to the point of 
tolerance. If the urine gives that reaction, or acidosis threatens 
the patient, the greatest caution must be exercised in the reduction 
of carbohydrate. 

Senile Glycosuria.^This is probably not true diabetes, but a 
failure of metabolism in general. The urine contains sugar, but 
there may be neither polyuria, polydipsia, nor polyphagia. If 
the senile change is accompanied by atheroma, gangrene may 
originate from a slight injury. In all cases of senile glycosuria, 
extreme care is required in regard to the diet. It is extremely 
risky to put them on carbohydrate-free diet. But the tolerance 
of carbohydrate is low, and the allowance 'ought to be cut down 
somewhat. j\Iilk, eggs, fish, tripe, fowl, rabbit, lamb, and rarely 
cooked beef, should be the staple foods. The necessity for protein 
is naturaUy diminished after sixty- five years of age; therefore the 
allowance may be gradually cut down to 60, 50, or even 40 grammes 
a day with advantage to the patient. Fat of all kinds is permis- 
sible. Oatmeal should be recommended ; of course, it must be taken 
in moderation. The allowance of bread and potato should be 
slightly limited, but the effect of reducing carbohydrates ought to 
be closely watched, lest acidosis arise. The total value of the food 
should depend on the activity of the patient; it should not be so 
high as for a person in middle life, and may be reduced to 1,800 
or I, goo calories for men, and less for women. 

Diabetes Insipidus. 

The most conspicuous signs are polydipsia and polyuria. The 
pathogeny is not clear. It appears to be due to reflex causes, 
neuropathic conditions, interstitial nephritis, irritation from a 
large prostate, etc. Cases of true essential polyuria are sometimes 
due to adrenaliniemia, arising from overaction of the chromaffin 
system. They have been traced to a violent shock, injury to the 
brain, etc. The metabolism of nitrogen is often largely increased, 
owing to the flow of a large amount of fluid through the tissues. 

The treatment is not very satisfactory. No readjustment or 
alteration of the food appears to influence its course. The demand 



484 DIABETES I \ SI PI BUS 

for protein niay be much increased; this can only be determined 
by an estimation of the nitrogen in the urine. It is seldom, however, 
that the actual requirement is more than 1-7 or 2 grammes of pro- 
tein per kilo ; but in exceptional cases 3 grammes per kilo are neces- 
sary to meet the loss from exaggerated metabolism. The loss of 
weight is due to destruction of fat to provide water. When all the 
fat in the body is used up, the tissue proteins will be used. Rational 
feeding is all that is necessary. In addition to some increase of 
protein, the patient should have plent}' of fat, especially butter, 
cream, milk, salad-oil, cod-liver oil. The wasting of the body 
maj' be prevented bj' generous feeding. Concentrated foods, such 
as meat-powders, somatose, casein preparations, extract of malt, 
etc., will be useful. No good results from restriction of carbo- 
hydrates. There is a marked intolerance of common salt, and in 
some patients it is easy to cause salt fever by pushing its use to 
excess. " Dry diet," or limitation of liquids, has been found bene- 
ficial when the primary symptom is polydipsia, but injurious, and 
even dangerous, when polyuria appears first. It causes such dis- 
comfort that very few patients persevere with this diet. The 
relief of thirst is important; dryness of the mouth may be checked 
by using sialogogues, and by masticating chewing-gum, rubber, 
dried prunes, horseradish, sweet-flag, curcuma, galangal, and other 
roots, which encourage the action of the salivary glands. 



CHAPTER XVI 

THE PANCREAS, THYROID, AND OTHER GLANDS 

The influence of the ductless glands on metabolism has not been 
recognized until recent years. A well-known work on Physiology, 
published in 1885, says: " These organs, included under the general 
title of ductless glands, seem to be the remains of organs which 
once have been of importance in the economy, but which, in the 
process of evolution, have come to play a subsidiary part." Since 
that time it has been discovered that these organs occupy an im- 
portant and by no means subsidiary position, in the human economy. 
But it is especiafly since the discovery of internal secretions, hor- 
mones, and ceUular enzymes, that these organs have " arrived," 
so to speak, and have been accorded a rank equal to their im- 
portance. The influence of one gland on another is best observed 
by stimulating or extirpating one gland, and observing the changes 
in the others. The brilhant researches of Eppinger, Ruddinger, 
and Falta^ were made in that way. They arrived at the conclu- 
sion — (i) That there is a mutual inhibition between the thyroid 
and the pancreas, and between the pancreas and adrenals; (2) there 
is a mutual stimulation between the thyroids and adrenals, but 
the inhibition is greater than the stimulation; (3) extirpation or 
hypofunction of one gland leads to excessive activity or diminished 
activity of the other glands, according as the influence of the ex- 
tirpated gland was stimulating or inhibitory. The following 
diagram is illustrative of these conclusions:

486 THE PANCREAS, THYROID, AND OTHER GLANDS 

The Pancreas.^ — Removal of the pancreas is followed by (i) hyper- 
glycaemia and glycosuria ; (2) hyperthyroidism, increased me- 
tabolism of protein, fats, and carbohydrates; (3) increased activity 
of the adrenals (chromaffin system), and excessive mobilization of 
carbohydrates; the metabolism of carbohydrates being hindered by 
loss of the internal secretion of the pancreas. We need not return 
to the subject of diabetes mellitus. 

The symptoms common to pancreatic diseases are glycosuria 
(possibly maltosuria), fatt^' diarrhoea, deficient digestion of fat and 
muscle, and epigastric pain. In pancreatic lithiasis there are fatty 
stools, defective digestion of meat, occasional diarrhcea, and, 
finally, diabetes. In neuroses of the pancreas, fatty stools and un- 
digested meat are common; but diarrhoea is not an ordinary 
symptom. Glycosuria, accompanied by the signs of a transitory 
pancreatitis, may occur in infectious diseases. The symptoms of 
acute pancreatitis suggest the occurrence of intestinal obstruction, 
there being a sudden attack of pain, followed by vomiting. In 
chronic pancreatitis there are digestive disturbances, epigastric 
pain and tenderness, progressive loss of strength, and the distinctive 
symptoms of pancreatic disease, which may be confirmed by 
Cammidge's reaction, and an examination of the faeces for trypsin. 

The dietetic treatment of acute pancreatitis is the same as in 
other inflammatory conditions. Milk and its preparations should 
form the staple diet; custard, junket, jelly, etc., soup, or broth, 
may be given, with the idea of stimulating the gastric digestion of 
proteins. Eggs may be given, raw or lightly cooked. Carbohy- 
drates and fat should not predominate in the diet, but some must 
be given. Pancreatic extracts, extract of malt or takadiastase, 
may be given to assist digestion of farinaceous foods. Benger's 
and other predigested foods can be given w^hen vomiting has sub- 
sided. Functional disorders may be much improved, but pan- 
creatitis runs an unfavourable course. If the patient survives the 
initial period, and the disease subsides into a subacute or chronic 
form, the return to ordinary diet must be gradual, and should be 
regulated by the degree of glycosuria, power of digestion, and 
ability to assimilate food. It may be necessary to put the patient 
on the diet for severe diabetes. 

The Thyroid Gland.- — Removal of the thj^roid for goitre produces 
cachexia strumipriva, in which there is a diminution of physical 
energy, dulness of intellect, and apathy. This condition is almost 
identical with cretinism due to^defective development [athyroidea) , 
and a similar condition occurs in myxoedema. The thyroid gland 
has a marked influence on carbohydrate metabolism through its 
control over the pancreas, and recent experiments have shown that 
protein metabolism is controlled through its influence on the liver, 
and calcium metabolism through the parathyroids. 

Marasmus in Children.- — Wasting of the body is due to various 
causes, but in many cases it is associated with inactivity of the 
ihyroid gland. The children require careful dieting, and should 



MARASMTTS AND RICKETS 487 

be given those foods which stimulate the thyroid — e.g., oatmeal, 
minced Hver, raw meat, and raw-meat juice. Oatmeal markedly 
influences the functional activity of the thyroid, promotes growth 
of the body, and increase of weight. Raw meat, liver, raw-meat 
juice, and meat extracts containing vitamines (q.v.) have a similar 
effect. Milk and eggs, although exceedingly valuable foods, and 
absolutely necessary for children, do not stimulate the thyroid so 
much. A diet of bread, milk, and eggs was found to reduce the 
activity of the thyroid in animals, but is almost neutral. Whole 
wheatmeal and germ bread stimulate growth and nutrition much 
more than white bread. Cod-liver oil is extremely valuable; the 
small amount of iodine may have an influence on the gland. 

Rickets. — This disease is especially common in children fed on 
farinaceous foods deficient in fat and protein. But there is some- 
thing more. Scurvy-rickets is associated with a want of freshness 
in the food. The concentration of foods — e.g., in condensed milk 
and farinaceous foods — often disturbs the relation of the mineral 
constituents. Babes at the breast do not develop rickets because 
the milk is fresh ; it contains ions of the metals and various vitamines. 
These vitamines are destroyed by boiling or condensing milk, and the 
ions are reduced to ordinary salts. Fresh vegetables are chiefly 
valuable because they contain ionized substances. The nutritive 
disturbances in rickets are accompanied by changes in the bones. 
It has been suggested that these changes have an inflammatory 
origin, possibly due to lactic acid absorbed from the alimentary 
canal. Whether this be so or not, it is certain there is something 
interfering with the metabolism of calcium. Recent observations 
show an association between rickets and insufficiency of the para- 
thyroids. It would, however, be premature to ascribe all cases of 
rickets to disease of the thyroid and its accessory glands, for similar 
changes to those occurring in rickets have been observed in animals 
after the removal of the thymus as well as the parathyroids. 

The food of a rickety child should be in accordance with these 
findings. Foods rich in lime, especially fresh milk, should be given. 
Lactophosphate or hypophosphate of lime and lime-water would be 
useful, but it is useless to give the child more lime than is contained 
in a proper daily allowance of human or cow's milk. Milk, cream, 
eggs, and cod-liver oil have ever been found valuable in the treatment 
of rickets and scurvy- rickets. Raw-meat juice, scraped raw meat, and 
meat extracts are beneficial. Whether the disease is due to thyroid 
insufficiency or irritation of the bones by'lactic acid, it w'ould be a 
correct procedure to limit the consumption of carbohydrates. All 
fats are beneficial. Cheadle says the food should consist of one-third 
carbohydrate, one-third protein, and a quarter fat. Oatmeal is 
probably the best carbohydrate food, seeing that it stimulates the 
activity of the thyroid. Oatmeal-water should not be regarded as 
a mere diluent of milk for infant feeding, but as'a foodstuff of special 
value for growing infants. In the third year of life oatmeal porridge 
and milk should form a staple breakfast dish for all children, and 



488 THE PANCREAS. THYROID, AND OTHER GLANDS 

this should be followed by dry rusks or crusty bread, which necessi- 
tate mastication and cause a flow of saliva. In gouty persons the 
thjToid gland probably works at high pressure; in the children of 
such people the nutrition is often disturbed, their urine concen- 
trated, and their skin affected by eruptions. Oatmeal is not always 
beneficial to such children ; they cannot always digest or assimilate 
it. The symptoms complained of are sometimes exaggerated by 
oatmeal, but this occurs less often when oatmeal and milk form the 
whole meal, than when the porridge is followed by egg and bacon 
or other rich foods. The daily use of fruit-juices (orange-juice, straw- 
berry-juice) and fresh vegetables — e.g., boiled carrot, vegetable 
marrow, potato cooked in the skin, baked apple, or apple sauce — 
is very necessary in all cases of scurvy-rickets. 

Osteomalacia. — If this disease is due to insufficiency of the para- 
thyroids it requires similar treatment to rickets and cretinism. 

It has, however, been shown that the suprarenal bodies are con- 
cerned in the retention of calcium, and osteomalacia is improved by 
the administration of adrenalin or suprarenal extract, whereby there 
is caused a retention of calcium. The thyroid and adrenal glands 
mutuallv stimulate each other; therefore thyroid insufficiency 
implies a loss of the normal stimulant to the adrenals. There is a 
retention of calcium in the organism after the menopause, and 
osteomalacia has been cured by artificial production of the meno- 
pause by oophorectomy; therefore it may be concluded that the 
ovaries influence calcium metabolism. 

In osteomalacia the diet should consist largely of milk and oat- 
meal. An abundance of fresh meat, fowl, fish, soup, and meat 
extracts should also be given to nourish the body. The idea is to 
stimulate the thyroid gland, and through it the adrenals. At the 
same time, we should endeavour to avoid gastro-intestinal catarrh, 
bacterial fermentation, or disturbances of the liver and other 
organs. 

Acute Thyroiditis.^This affection may occur during the course of 
any infectious disease, and causes pain and distress by the tension 
in the gland. It may affect only the isthmus, one lobe, or the whole 
gland. The fever diet should be prescribed; but oatmeal, meat 
extracts, soups, etc., should be forbidden; the gland should not be 
stimulated until the inflammation is subsided. 

Goitre or Bronchocele. — Endemic goitre is associated in the minds 
of men with some impurity in the drinking-water; but the cause 
ma\^ be in the food, air, unhygienic surroundings, and want of sun- 
shine. It is the custom to prescribe distilled or boiled water on the 
assumption that the active agent in water is destroyed by boiling. 
The disease occurs in people who live in calcareous or limestone 
districts; and, seeing that the thyroid is interested in calcium 
metabolism, it is proper to reduce the amount of calcium in the food. 
Red meat should be eaten sparingly; oatmeal and milk should not 
be conspicuous in the diet, but fish, fowl, tripe, and sweetbread may 
be ordered, with plenty of vegetables and fruit. 



EXOPHTHALMIC GOITRIC 489 

Exophthalmic Goitre {Gtaves's or Basedow's Disease). — This affec- 
tion is due to hvpcrsecretion by the thyroid gland (hyperthy- 
roidism). The simple hypertrophy of the thyroid occurring in 
young people, especially girls, is to be regarded as a protective 
rather than a pathological phenomenon. But it should not be 
forgotten that any enlargement, however slight, carries with it the 
elements of the more serious Graves's disease, and it should not be 
dismissed as a trifling ailment. There is no need for operative 
treatment — this would destroy the compensatory effort and do 
irreparable damage. Rest, and a light nourishing but unstimu- 
lating, diet are essential. 

In more severe cases also the primary requisite is rest in bed. 
The observation that oatmeal and liver strongly stimulate, animal 
foods in general moderately stimulate, and a diet of milk, eggs, 
bread-and-butter, biscuits, etc., only slightly stimulate, the thyroid 
glands, shows the way to the dietetic treatment of exophthalmic 
goitre. Oatmeal, liver, and excess of animal foods must be avoided ; 
butcher's meat, oysters, and lobster should be forbidden. But the 
food must be good, light, and nourishing. Once a day the patient 
may have a moderate helping of fish or fowl (domestic fowl, pheasant, 
partridge, quail, pigeon, etc.), with potatoes, vegetables, and fresh 
fruit. Eggs, milk, milk puddings, custard, junket, jelly, bread-and- 
butter, and bacon or fat ham will complete the dietary. Fresh 
fruit and salads are advantageous; the amount should be regu- 
lated by their action on the bowels. Tea and coffee, owing to 
their well-known tendency to affect the sympathetic system 
and cause tachycardia, tremors, and other nervous symptoms, 
should only be taken in the strictest moderation. These patients 
are better without any alcohol, but a little good red wine may 
be allowed if any is considered desirable. Tobacco should be for- 
bidden. 

Hyperfunction of the thyroid glands leads to inhibition of the 
pancreas, and may cause indigestion. On the contrary, any 
measure which stimulates the pancreas would reduce thyroid 
activity. Especial care should be taken to prevent gastric and 
hepatic disturbances. Indigestible foods — ices, cakes, sweets, con- 
fectionery, nuts, pickles, etc. — must be avoided. If gastric 
catarrh supervenes, the diet ought to consist chiefly of milk and 
farinaceous foods — tapioca, sago, rice, and arrowroot. These will 
not irritate the stomach or stimulate the thjToid. When the heart 
is weak, and when the stomach recovers tone after catarrh, allow 
some pounded chicken, fish, or poached eggs; but the milk should be 
continued until the gland recovers its alDility to metabolize iodine. 
The milk of thyroidectomized animals is beneficial; very good 
results have been obtained from its use. Goebel says such milk does 
not contain iodine, because the organ which excretes it has been 
removed. Other foods containing a recognizable amount of iodine 
(see p. 400) may advantageously be removed from the diet, while 
those containing arsenic — e.g., eggs^ — might be prescribed. 



490 THE PANCREAS, THYROID. AND OTHER GLANDS 

Iodine in Plants. — Potatoes, carrots, endive, parsley, nil; cucumber 
0*012, kidney beans 0'0i3, pumpkin 0"0i7, spinach 0021, sorrel 
0*047, melon o*o6o, tomatoes 0070, green peas 0*084, lettuce 0*096, 
beans 0*140, chervil 0*140, beetroot 0*140, radish o*i6o, turnip

sardines, herring, carp, and mullet o*6, shrimps 0*7, periwinkle 0*75, 
sole, eel, and herring roe 0*8, coal-fish 0*9, cod, roach, bream, ling, 
and gurnard 1*2, 03'sters 1*3, salmon 1*4, milligrammes per kilo. 

Lacto-V cgetarian Did may be useful. It should consist of milk, 
bread-and-butter, puddings, fresh vegetables and uncooked fruit, 
and a few nuts. One eg^ may be allowed at breakfast-time. But 
oatmeal, germ bread, entire wheat bread, asparagus, spinach, peas, 
beans, and lentils should all be forbidden. 

Thymus Feeding has been established as a " cure " for hyper- 
thyroidism. It is significant that exophthalmic goitre is rare in 
children, and that so long as the thymus remains, hyperthyroidism 
never occurs ; while the occurrence of exophthalmic goitre in 
young adults, after the complete atrophy of the thymus, suggests 
that the disease is due in part to the removal of some restraining 
influence which the thymus held over that gland. The prescription 
of J ounce daily of the fresh thymus (throat sweetbread) of the lamb 
for a period of three or four months has been found to diminish the 
prominence of the eyeballs, and tachj^cardia, but it had no influence 
on the goitre and muscular tremors. 

Rest of the body diminishes nervous excitabilit}^ but absolute 
rest in bed is onh^ necessary in severe cases. Mineral water contain- 
ing phosphate of soda, 15 to 30 grains twice a day, is useful; and 
waters containing iron and arsenic are beneficial. Prolonged resi- 
dence at the seaside — Brighton, Folkestone, Westgate, Biarritz — is 
useful in some cases, and at a moderate elevation in the Alps for 
others, but a great elevation like Davos is not suitable. Country life 
is suitable to those who cannot afford a sea or mountain climate. 
Any excess of exercise ought to be forbidden. 

Myxcedema and Sporadic Cretinism.— The foods known to have a 
stimulating effect on the thyroid ought to be prescribed- — e.g., oat- 
meal, liver, and all animal foods. All foods known to contain iodine 
should be given. Foods known to have a sedative effect on the 
thyroid should be avoided. Milk is almost neutral, and should be 
considered an essential food, especially for children. Adults should 
have an abundant, plain, simple, and nutritive diet, consisting of 
oatmeal, liver, fresh meat, meat extracts, eggs, fish, and fresh 
vegetables. Potatoes, sugar, bread, cakes, and other carbohydrate 
foods should occup5^ a smaller place than usual in the diet. All foods 
containing iodine and arsenic are good. Everything should be done 
to avoid indigestion and alimentary toxaemia, which would throw 
extra" work on'^the thyroid gland. If the patient presents signs of 
pancreatic deficiency, such as insomnia, persistent headache, and 
constipation, the use of pancreatic extracts may be beneficial. 



THE THYMUS GL-IXD 401 

Thyroid extract relieves tlie symptoms of myxnedema in many 
cases; but it is possible to stimulate the thyroid too much by this 
means, and thereby exaggerate the fatigue of the gland and bring 
about a worse condition of the patient. The combined thyroid 
proteins of the sheep, with their abundance of globulin (colloid), 
ha\e liecn found free from this disadvantage. 

The Thymus Gland.^ — The thymus appears to have only a tem- 
porary use in the organism. It is most active soon after birth, 
attaining its maximum at two years, after which it graduallv 
atrophies, and disappears after puberty. It is associated with the 
thyroid, for experiments have shown that when the thymus is 
removed, less thyroid suffices. The thymus is of importance in the 
nitrogenous and calcium metabolism of children. There is a 
deficiency of thymus secretion in marasmus, wasting, deficiency of 
growth, rickets, and osteomalacia. The internal secretion of the 
thymus neutralizes some element of the thyroid secretion. In the 
absence of thymus, the thyroid gland does not have to work at such 
high pressure, in consequence of which there is a diminished reten- 
tion of calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen. In these diseases, there- 
fore, it is the thyroid gland which requires stimulation; clinical 
experience has shown the necessity for prescribing oatmeal and 
milk, meat-juice, raw minced liver, scraped raw meat, meat extracts, 
germ bread, wholemeal bread, and other foods which stimulate the 
thyroid, and to restrict farinaceous foods. The administration of 
thyroid extract and raw thymus gland is beneficial. 

Excess of Thymus Gland has been found in cases of obesity in 
children, larjTigismus stridulus, paroxysmal dyspnoea (thymus 
asthma), adenoids, general enlargement of the l\TTiphatic glands, 
status lymphaticus, myasthenia gravis, exophthalmic goitre, acute 
leukaemia, and sudden death. In most of the diseases named 
experience has taught that a long course of milk diet, eggs, fari- 
naceous foods, and vegetables, is beneficial to the patient. The 
thymus and thvroid are closely associated in their functions. The 
foods which make little or no demand on the thyroid, or do not 
stimulate it, will soothe the thymus or check its excessive activity, 
and under the joint influence of these glands the metabolism of 
calcium, phosphorus, and nitrogen will be diminished. There are, 
however, some cases where the excessive thymus secretion neutra- 
lizes the thyroid secretion so completely that the metabolism of 
carbon is interfered with. In these cases thyroid extract, and 
those foods which stimulate thyroid activity, should be given. 

The Spleen and Lymphatic Glands. 

The lymphatic glands are the seat of interchanges between the 
blood and lymph. Leucoc>i;es multiply in their. follicles; leucocy- 
tosis follows every meal, and is increased or diminished by circum- 
stances. It is probable that those glands elaborate some substance 



492 THE PANCREAS, THYROID. AND OTHER GLANDS 

useful in metabolism, or destroy materials deleterious to the 
organism. The part taken in metabolism by the spleen is unsettled, 
but it is associated with the metabolism of iron, and the richness 
of spleen in extractives indicates the importance of the organ in 
dealing with nitrogenous bodies, and particularly with the destruc- 
tion of red blood-cells. That the spleen is not essential to life is 
shown by the fact that men and animals do not die when the organ 
is removed; but splenectomy is followed by progressive loss of 
flesh, ansemia, diminution of the red and increase of the w^hite 
blood-corpuscles, permanent enlargement of the l3'mphatic glands, 
and pains in the long bones, indicating compensatory changes in the 
marrow. 

Hodgkin's Disease {Lymphadenoma, Pseudo-leuktsmia, and Splenic 
AncBmia). — These diseases are believed by many writers to be due 
to a chronic toxaemia originating in the spleen, the ansemia being 
caused by haemolysis by a toxin originating in the spleen or else-, 
where. Mycosis fungoides is said by Ziegler to be a special develop- 
ment of Hodgkin's disease, and he believes both to be due to a 
micro-organism which has escaped detection. 

Our knowledge of these diseases offers very little to indicate the 
kind of diet which would affect their course. Besides saying that 
the food should be light, nourishing, and digestible, there is little 
to add. All foods containing iron, arsenic, and iodine may be pre- 
scribed — the former to assist in the provision of material for blood- 
making, the latter to stimulate the blood-making organs. Ox-bone 
marrow, fresh or in tabloid form, and its preparations — e.g., Virol — 
thymus gland and its extract, spleen and its extracts, will be useful. 
One or two ounces of fresh bone marrow should be eaten daily. 
Spleen can be taken raw by pounding it, and giving it in jelly, 
extract of meat, or extract of malt. Thymus gland (throat sweet- 
bread) can be given in the same way. The remainder of the food 
should be similar to that given for anaemia {q.v.). The inorganic 
calx sulphurata has been beneficially prescribed for this disease. 
Bearing this in mind, we may also prescribe foods containing the 
organic compounds of sulphur — e.g., cabbage, spinach, asparagus, 
onions, garlic, chives, mustard and cress, watercress, and horse- 
radish. If these substances do not upset the alimentary organs, 
they may stimulate the metabolic functions of all the glands, and 
improve the general condition. The sulphurous waters of Harro- 
gate, Pitkeathly, and Kreuznach, and the iodine waters of Woodhall 
Spa and other places may be beneficial. The injection of irnpure 
thyroid globulin has in some individuals proved more efficacious 
than iron or arsenic in promoting the manufacture of red blood- 
cells. 

Addison's Disease. 

The chromaffin system, including the adrenal and accessory 
adrenal bodies, are of importance in metabolism. They exert a 



ADDISON'S DISEASE 493 

marked infliK-iue on nutrition. They also keep up the cardiac and 
vascukir tone by their intluence on all involuntary muscular fibres. 
They promote the retention of calcium. The adrenal and thyroid 
glands mutually stimulate each other, but the adrenals are some- 
what inhibited by the pancreas. Hyperglyctemia and glycosuria 
occur when the pancreas is removed, or when the blood contains an 
excess of adrenalin. In Addison's disease there is hypof unction of 
the adrenals and the special symptoms of the disease. The 
absence of those symptoms, when the suprarenal capsules are 
diseased, is due to compensatory enlargement of the accessory 
adrenal bodies. 

The treatment of Addison's disease is unsatisfactory. The 
tissues waste rapidly. The food, therefore, must be nourishing and 
abundant, but it should be light and easily digested. The irritation 
of the alimentary mucosa may require abstinence from food occasion- 
ally. If there is any vomiting, some iced champagne, albumin-water, 
lime-water and milk, peptonized milk, Brand's essence, or Valen- 
tine's beef-juice, should be given in very small doses until it sub- 
sides. If there be diarrhoea, the patient should abstain from soup, 
broth, yolk of eggs, and extracts of meat; the diet should consist of 
arrowroot and milk, cornflour and milk, Benger's food, a teaspoon- 
ful or two of scraped meat, pounded chicken or fish, and albumin- 
water as a beverage. If diarrhoea is a constant feature, the patient 
should be put on a diet for chronic diarrhrea or intestinal catarrh 
(PP- 33^> 356)- In other cases the regular diet for chronic catarrh of 
tlie stomach and bowels is applicable to Addison's disease. Alcohol 
may be necessary when syncope threatens. If the patient is mark- 
edly tubercular, the diet for tuberculosis should be in general use; 
but it wiU be necessary to watch for gastro-intestinal troubles, and 
order the diet suitable for them. 



Acromegaly. 

The pathology of this disease is unsettled. In many cases it is 
associated with adenoma of the pituitary body, and chiefly of the 
anterior lobe, which presses on the posterior lobe and disturbs its 
functions. The anterior lobe of the pituitary body influences the 
growth of bones, development of stature, and form of the body; 
the posterior lobe exercises a powerful influence over the vaso- 
motor system (it regulates the blood-pressure), and over the 
metabolism of carbohydrates. Removal of the posterior lobe, or 
a diminution of its secretion from any cause, enhances the power 
of storing carbohydrate, but depreciates the power of using it. In 
the early stages of acromegaly there is hyperpituitarism; the whole 
gland is affected. The increased function of the anterior lobe 
causes skeletal changes; the increased function of the posterior lobe 
leads to hyperglyciemia, polydipsia, polyuria, and glycosuria. A 
frequent examination of the urine, therefore, is necessary. The 



.J94 THE PANCREAS, THYROID. AND OTHER GLANDS 

patient should be dieted as in the same way as for diabetes {q.v.), 
and the metabohsm of carbohj'drates shoukl be aided by pancreatic 
extracts. By-and-by there will be hypopituitarism due to loss of 
the secretion of the posterior lobe, leading to obesity and fatty 
changes in the liver or other glands. Now the tolerance of carbo- 
hydrates is increased, but their oxidation is defective. The diet 
should now consist of ordinary mixed food; but the oxidative 
processes should be assisted by the administration of thyroid and 
pituitary extracts until glycosuria is produced. 



CHAPTER XVH 

DISEASES OF THE SKIN 

Acute Diseases of the skin should have the same dietetic treat- 
ment as other inflammatory diseases {fever diet). These include 
acute eczema, erythema, erysipelas, lichen tropicus, urticaria, 
roseola, etc. 

Chronic Diseases of the Skin usually require the same treatment 
as indigestion and alimentary toxaemia. A few remarks on special 
diseases are appended: 

Hyperidrosis. — -Seek for the causes of debility, and treat them. 
If it allects chiefly the hands and feet, look for orthostatic or inter- 
mittent albuminuria, or spermatorrhoea. The food should be 
nourishing, but hot milk, oatmeal, and excess of carbohydrates, 
onions, horseradish, etc., should be avoided. Anidrosis requires 
the opposite treatment: abundance of warm foods, hot milk, oat- 
meal, plenty of carbohydrates, onions, garlic, horseradish, and all 
substances containing sulphur. The usual means of stimulating 
the skin should be adopted. 

Seborrhcea requires a tonic regimen: foods containing iron for 
the cldurotic, arsenic for the anaemic, and a course of cod-liver oil 
for the strumous. Indigestion and alimentary toxaemia should be 
looked for and treated. If the disease is associated with hyperi- 
drosis, an excess of carbohydrates must be avoided. 

Acne Vulgaris requires a tonic regimen. The food should be 
nutritious, but excess of carbohydrates must be avoided, espcciaUy 
sugar, and sweet foods; beer, and alcohol should be forbidden. The 
condition of the thyroid, ovaries, and other glands should be investi- 
gated. 

Acne Rosacea.- — Particular care must be taken to prevent or cure 
existing indigestion , constipation, luemorrhoids, and menstrual 
troubles. Ihe patient should be impressed with the necessity for 
closely observing the effects of all kinds of food on the skin. 
Ordinary light food is usuaUy sufiticient. Hot meals do not suit the 
complaint. Fat is sometimes injurious. Irritating foods, alcohol, 
and condiments should be prohibited as a rule; but many patients 
are improved by eating cayenne pepper with meat and lish. China 
tea is better than other kinds. Milton says the patient should not 
abstain from tea; it is one of the best stimulants for the depressed 
organism. A moderate amuunt of light claret or Burgundy is 

495 



40 DISEASES OF THE SKIN 

sometimes beneficial. Men ^vho have been much addicted to alcohol 
may have a little good cognac and water. 

Lichen. — The chronic form requires light and unstimulating diet. 
High feeding is not beneficial, but the diet should tend to improve 
the nutrition and standard of health. The foods likely to cause indi- 
gestion must be forbidden. Beer, ale, and stout should be avoided; 
but a small quantity of hock, Sauterne, Saumur, and white Val de 
Peiias would be beneficial. Foods containing iron, arsenic, and 
iodine are suitable if they do not upset digestion. Cod-liver oil is 
beneficial in man}' cases. 

Eczema. — Ihe chronic disease requires good, plain, nourishing 
food — e.g., fat bacon and egg for breakfast, fat meat and plenty of 
vegetables for dinner, and a simple pudding or other light food for 
supper- — that is, the diet should be of the ordinary kind, but moder 
ate in quantity, and free from spices and condiments. Excessive 
eating is injurious. Ihe chief thing is to avoid indigestion and 
alimentary toxaemia. It should never be forgotten that the skin 
trouble will be aggravated by irritation of the gastric mucosa. 
Therefore meat, fowl, fish, and eggs must be quite fresh and free 
from taint or high-keeping, linned and potted meat must not be 
consumed, neither should pork, veal, sausage, shellfish, salted 
meat, or fish. A small amount of fat ham or bacon for breakfast 
is permissible, but the persistent use of salt foods for all meals is 
highly injurious. Cheese, especially very ripe cheese, is bad. 
Starchy and sweet foods require careful consideration. Bread 
must be good, and either white or wholemeal bread; bran bread 
must not be eaten. Oatmeal should be avoided. When there is 
any gastro-intestinal catarrh, starchy foods should be taken spar- 
ingly. Reflex irritation of the skin follows irritation of the mucosa 
by organic acids. Potatoes are usually a valuable addition to the 
diet, and all well-cooked vegetables are useful foods. Salads, such 
as lettuce, watercress, and celery and fresh fruit, are good in most 
cases. Sugar is sometimes injurious, and cessation from its use is 
often beneficial. Fat is not injurious, but a great quantity might 
cause hypochlorhydria and lead to organic acidity of the stomach. 
Sour-milk treatment is sometimes beneficial. 

1 ea and coffee are excellent beverages when not taken to excess, 
but alcohol is injurious in most cases. A small amount of red wine 
— Val de Peiias, port, or claret — may do good in cold weather. 
Malt liquors should be forbidden. 

Psoriasis.' — Every effort should be made to improve the general 
health. Ihe condition of malassimilation and debility must be 
attacked. If the health is apparently good, the diet should be the 
same as in chronic eczema- — that is, a light ordinary diet, free from 
spices and condiments, and indigestible articles. Forbid oatmeal, 
new bread, pastry, dressed dishes, pickles, strong tea and coffee, 
wine, and malt liquors. Potatoes are sometimes injurious. Salis- 
bury diet is beneficial in some, and a milk diet in other cases. 
Vegetarian diet is useful when there is a disordered metabolism, or 



SKi\ Disr.Asns 497 

the urine is acid and has a high specific gravity. A sedentary 
occupation should be changed for a more active Hfe — e.g., removal 
from town to country, farm life, or other useful occupation. Sea 
air is prejtulicial to psoriasis, hut a course of sulphurous waters and 
baths is bcncticial. 

Ichthyosis requires similar dietary to chronic eczema or psoriasis. 

Chronic erythema and urticaria as a rule require the same dietary 
as chronic eczema; but when the patient is exhausted by the 
disease, the food should be more stimulating. Good rich soup, 
oysters, and port wine are then benehcial. When the disease is 
due to alimentary toxaemia, the dietary for that disorder should be 
prescribed. 

Lupus. — The tubercular condition which underlies this affection 
demands the dietar\' for tuberculosis. The food should be light 
and restorative rather than stimulating. Heating foods cause the 
lupous patches to feel stiffer. But some cases do better when the 
food is well seasoned with condiments, and fresh vegetables con- 
taining organic sulphur are consumed. In these cases all vegetables 
of the CrucifercB are beneficial, if they do not upset the alimentary 
organs, and coffee is preferable to tea. When there is marked 
debility, the liberal use of light wine — Chablis or Sauterne — is bene- 
ficial, but fiery wines — e.g., brandied port and sherry — and malt 
liquors are injurious. 

Purpura and Scurvy. — The food should be light and nutritious. 
Fresh milk should be taken unboiled, so that the greatest amount 
of enzymes, lecithin, and vitamine may be obtained. Raw-meat 
juice, scraped meat, meat broths, soup, eggs, custard, and jellies 
are valuable. The diet must also contain mashed fresh potatoes 
(boiled in the skin), carrots, onions, cabbage, and apples. If the 
gums are not too sore to permit mastication, the green salads, 
onions, lettuce, dandelion-leaves, and fresh fruits are exceedingly 
valuable. Lime-juice and lemon-juice hold a high rank as curative 
agents. The chapter on Vitamines should be read. 

Pellagra. — The diet must be carefully considered. There must 
be a normal adjustment of the proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and 
energy. An excess of fat would exaggerate diarrhoea in some 
cases; in others it would prevent constipation. Excess of carbo- 
hydrates would lead to fermentation, and intensify the gastro- 
intestinal catarrh. A meat diet has been found beneficial in some 
cases, especially where animal food has previously been deficient. 
Zomotherapy has also been beneficial. The main treatment, how- 
ever, consists in the supply of good nourishment, with a slight 
preponderance of animal food — meat, milk, eggs, poultry, fish, fresh 
fruit, and vegetables— and enough bread, potatoes, and cereal pro- 
ducts to make up a sufficiency. In this w^ay, whether the disease 
is due to deficiency of vitamines {q.v.), to toxaemia, or chronic 
infection, the body will be nourished, metabolism provoked, and 
the formation of antibodies encouraged. Whether the disease is 
due to eating maize or not, common sense suggests the exclusion of 

32 



498 DISEASES OF THE SKIN 

this suspected food; 'but some phj^sicians find coarse maize-meal 
containing the cuticle is curative. When gastro-intestinal catarrh 
is a marked feature, the patient should be dieted in the same way 
as other persons suffering from diarrhoea, chronic intestinal catarrh, 
etc. The condition of chronic constipation also demands the 
ordinary diet for that complaint. Alcohol is unnecessary as a rule 
• — it may be prejudicial — but koumiss, kephir, milk punch, some good 
red wine, well-diluted brandy or whisky, may occasionally be 
necessary. 



CHAPTER XVIII 

DISEASES OF THE BLOOD AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS 

Anaemia.- -The treaiment of the aiicemias may be taken together. 
One of the principal elements required for the formation of haemo- 
globin is iron. The body of a human being contains very little of 
this element. The blood of an adult contains only about 3 grammes 
(Halliburton), and there is a small amount in the other fluids of the 
body, and the liver and spleen. The normal percentage of iron 
in liver washed free from blood is O'lo (Bemmelen).i The propor- 
tion is greatest in the liver of new-bom animals; in leukaemia it 
may be reduced to 0-078 (Hunter), or even O'Cio (Halliburton). 
It is probable the liver is a place of storage for iron, especially in 
young animals; but this function persists throughout life. In per- 
nicious anaemia the liver is exceedingly rich in iron, owing to exces- 
sive destruction of red blood-cells. In fact, Biernacki proved that 
in chlorosis and some other forms of anaemia the total amount of 
iron in the body is normal or more than normal. However, it has 
been shown that iron is one of the essential elements of the food. 
If animals are deprived of it, they waste. Experiments show, if the 
food contains no iron, animals lose 40 per cent, of the iron of their 
body in three weeks.^ Stockmann^ estimated the average amount 
of iron in the ordinary mixed food of human beings is about 9 or 
ID milligrammes [\ grain) a day; but the food eaten by chlorotic 
subjects often contains as little as 3 milligrammes. Herter arrived 
at the same conclusions. 

The almost constant prescription of iron as a remedy for anaemia 
necessitates a consideration of its value. Iron salts have been used 
for ages, but doubt has been cast upon their usefulness. There is 
an absence of direct evidence to show that blood-cells are able to 
assimilate inorganic iron. Bungc, Morner,' and others assert that 
inorganic iron is not absorbed from the bowels, but it is beneficial 
by removing sulphuretted hydrogen from the alimentary canal and 
checking the putrefaction which destroys organic iron-bearing sub- 
stances. Von Noorden, Stockmann,^ and others, on the contrary, 
assert that inorganic salts of iron arc absorbed from the bowels.

500 DISEASES OF THE BLOOD AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS 

In any case, there is no doubt that various conditions dependent 
on the altered state of the blood are improved by them, and much 
benefit is derived from their general tonic influence. There is, 
however, a method of solving the problem, and that is by estimating 
the iron in the faeces. This was adopted b}' Munro of Cheltenham,^ 
who experimented on typical cases of clilorosis with freshly prepared 
Blaud's pills and ammonio-citrate of iron. Before giving iron he 
placed every patient on Schmidt's diet for a week, when the fresh 
faeces contained an average of 0'0022 gramme of iron, and the dried 
faeces 0-0089 gramme daily. The results obtained were as follows:

Iron is absorbed by the mucous membranes of the duodenum 
and jejunum, and passes by way of the lymph channels to the 
blood, and is deposited in the spleen and liver. There it is tem- 
porarily stored. Iron is excreted from the body, one-tenth by the 
kidne3'S and nine-tenths by the mucous membrane of the colon and 
caecum. The excessive amount of iron in the faeces of patients 
taking inorganic salts shows that the organism cannot make im- 
mediate use of large quantities; but the increase of haemoglobin 
and red corpuscles prove that such salts are not inert, although it 
is probable that the ordinary doses of iron taken as medicine are 
excessive. 

The normal supply of iron to the body consists of organic sub- 
stances, such as haemoglobin, and combinations of nucleo-albumin 
in vegetables, which have been called hcematogens. These nucleo- 
albumins take up iron circulating in the sap of plants, and convert 
it into absorbable and assimilable material. Although the inorganic 
combinations are badly absorbed and but little used, it seems certain 
that the organic forms of iron which occur in meat (muscle), fish, 
and especially liver, spleen, bone-marrow, and other animal and 
vegetable substances, are readily assimilated and easily used for 
the manufacture of haemoglobin. This point was also elucidated 

1 Brit. Med. Jour., 191 1, ii. 105.

by Munro,^ who experimented with commercial organic prepara-

The difference in the results obtained from organic and inorganic 
compounds is very marked. When inorganic salts are used, a very 
large proportion is unabsorbed and voided in the faeces; when 
organic preparations are given, a comparatively small amount 
escapes in the faeces, and the proportion of haemoglobin in the blood 
is much greater. Iron plays an important part in the formation 
of chlorophyll in plants, and its presence in all green vegetables is 
worthy of note. Iron in plants is not merely present as a pigment; 
it occurs in combination with under proteins in parts which possess 
no clilorophyU. Moreover, its importance in the human economy 
suggests the use of all foodstuffs which contain it.

According to Johnston,- the ash of potatoes and peas contains 
085 per cent, of oxide of iron, oats 005, maize and beans 040, 
carrots 0'32, cabbage 017, barley 016, and wheat a trace. Ac- 



^ Loc. cit. 



" Agricultural Chemistry." 



502 DISEASES OF THE BLOOD AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS 

cording to Halliburton, the ash of blood contains 8 37 per cent, of 
oxide of iron, liver 274, spleen 728, lungs 3-2, muscle 0-057, serum 
026, and milk 010. 

Arsenic is a stimulant to the blood-making organs. Its value in 
this respect has been well proved, and, like iron, the organic com- 
binations are more easil}' assimilated, and therefore more useful, 
than inorganic preparations. Until quite recently it was considered 
that arsenic is a constituent of very few tissues, but as the result 
of numerous experiments Bertrand^ found it to be a constant con- 
stituent of living cells, like carbon, sulphur, and phosphorus; that 
it exists in minute traces in all animals and vegetables, and is 
essential for their well-being. Nevertheless, the proportion in some 
tissues is greater than in others. Thus, he found the amount of 
arsenic in a fowl's egg varied from 00005 to 0005 miUigramme, 
two-thirds being in the yolk, and one-third in the white, shell, and 
lining membrane. 

In the treatment of anaemia, no matter what is the cause, the 
use of foods containing the largest proportion of iron is a scientific 
procedure. Haemoglobin contains 0'4 per cent, of iron, and there- 
lore blood, meat, and fresh-meat juice are important foods. There 
are various commercial preparations containing haemoglobin, such 
as Bovinine and Vinsip. Milk, in other respects so valuable for the 
anaemic and debilitated, contains only 0003 per cent, of iron. 
Therefore we must rely chiefly on meat, fish, oysters, liver, bone- 
marrow, spleen (" smelt "), lentils, beans, and other vegetable sub- 
stances. Stockmann^ estimated that i litre of milk contains 2 to 
43, 100 grammes dried bread 085 to i-q, 100 grammes dried oat- 
meal 35, 100 grammes dried beefsteak 39, 100 grammes yellow 
ox-marrow 2-5 to 4-0, and red calf-marrow y6 to 87, milligrammes 
of iron. 

It is probable that the nucleo-albumin iron-containing substances 
of ordinary food are the usual and sufficient source of iron for the 
organism, and the inorganic iron in the food is excreted unchanged. 
In clilorosis there is either increased destruction or diminished 
formation of haemoglobin. The theory of increased destruction is 
not very satisfactory; that of diminished formation is more 
important. Diminished formation is due to deficient function of 
the haematopoietic organs, which require stimulation. This must 
be done by good food, iron, and arsenic. In clilorotics the digestion 
and absorption are usually good, and metabolism the same as in 
health. Ketcher of St. Petersburg investigated the assimilation 
and metabolism of nitrogen in chlorotic women. The assimilation 
of nitrogen was normal, but the metabolism of nitrogen was 86'32 per 
cent. — that is, below the mean but not below the minimum for 
healthy individuals. The total quantity of nitrogen in the urine, 
the nitrogen of urea, the chlorides, and the phosphates, was less 
than normal. Lipmann-Wulf made similar investigations, and 

1 Bull, de la Soc. Chim. de Paris, 1904, No. 15.

ANMMIA 50 i 

concluded that chlorosis docs not cause an abnormal change in the 
metabolism ot protein. If there is any difference in the gastric 
functions, it is in the direction of hyperchlorhydria ; the total acidity 
of the stomach is increased in 95 per cent, of cases, and free hydro- 
chloric acid is in excess. It is important that this condition be 
borne in mind. Hayem^ considered it so important that he deprived 
the patient of bread for four or live weeks. The diet should consist 
of plenty of animal food, and the first meal of the day should always 
contain a fair proportion of meat or milk. Raw meat or scraped 
meat is more easily digested than that cooked in the ordinary way; 
it should never be higWy baked, rather underdone. Eggs, especially 
the yolk, are rich in iron, and should be taken freely. Oatmeal 
porridge or cornmeal mush, with plenty of cream or milk, is suitable. 
Bone-marrow should be especially recommended. Salads and all 
digestible fresh vegetables must be taken; when the stomach does 
not bear them very well they must be boiled and reduced to a puree. 
Any relation between alcohol and the formation of haemoglobin or 
blood-cells is highly improbable; but a small amount of red wine — 
claret, Burgundy, or port^ — or some beer or stout, may be allowed 
because they stimulate appetite and encourage nutrition. The 
patient should avoid salt-dried meat or fish, hashed meat, clear soup 
or broth, vinegar, pickles, spices, lime-juice, lemons, and other 
substances likely to cause indigestion. 

The amount of protein should be 100 to 120 grammes daily. The 
following sketch of a daily diet will be a sufficient indication of the 
food required. The meals should be small and frequent. A glass 
of hot milk should be taken on wakening. Breakfast should consist 
of oatmeal porridge, followed by an egg and some smoked bacon or 
a mutton-chop with bread-and-butter, tea or coffee with plenty of 
cream, and an apple or some other fresh fruit; 11 a.m., an ounce 
or two of raw-meat juice and port wine, or a sandwich or two of 
scraped meat, or a raw egg-and-milk with two or three biscuits. 
Dinner : A cupful of thickened soup, containing vegetables, under- 
done beef or mutton, fish, poultry, boiled green vegetables, especially 
spinach and potatoes, milk puddings containing eggs, fresh fruit, 
or cheese and salad. Tea : I wo or three sandwiches of raw scraped 
meat, followed by a few strawberries, lettuce, watercress, etc. ; 
6 p.m., a glass of port wine and raw-meat juice. Supper : oatmeal 
porridge, fish or meat. Bedtime : A glass of milk. 

Raw-meat juice must be carefully prepared (p. 213). If there is 
a doubt about its preparation and purity it would be better to 
prescribe Bovinine, Vinsip, and other preparations of blood. 

Bone-marrow is exceedingly valuable in anaemia, particularly 
pernicious anaemia and leukaemia. It was first recommended by 
Barrs. It is important to select red marrow, and the marrow of 
calves is better than that of oxen. A teaspoonful should be taken 
three times a day; some authorities prescribe from ij- to 4 ounces 
daily, the dose being gradually increased. It should be eaten raw,- 

1 Jour, des Prat., 1895, 17. 



504 DISEASES OF THE BLOOD AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS 

between thin slices of bread, seasoned with salt and pepper. If the 
patient is unable to take it in this way, it can be prepared by the 
method of Agasse-Lafond : Take a mortar which has been carefully 
scalded, mix in it 6 drachms of gelatin softened by a suitable 
quantit)^ of water, with i ounce of glycerine; in another scalded 
mortar mix 3 ounces of fresh red marrow with a fluid ounce of 
port wine. Mix the two together until they form a paste. This 
preparation is not disagreeable, and will not spoil the appetite. If 
fresh marrow cannot be obtained, the commercial products must 
be used. 

Spleen is also useful. It is sold by butchers under the name of 
'' smelt " or " milt." It can be used for making soup or gravy, but 
it would be better pounded in a mortar and eaten raw in soup, aspic, 
or sandwiches. 

Liver, from its large proportion of iron, should be equally 
serviceable. Its proteins are ferruginous nucleo-proteins. When 
liver is minced and boiled in water most of the ferruginous* protein 
is extracted; it has been called ferratin, and is sold commercially. 
Liver soup, made by boiling the minced liver with pot-herbs, should 
be often eaten. The fresh liver may be scraped and given uncooked 
in soup, broth, and sandwiches. 

There are various haimatogenous substances sold commercially. 
I'erroglidine is a vegetable preparation, iron somatose is a com- 
bination of beef peptonoids and iron ; they are exceedingly useful 
foods. 

The treatment of anaemia by limitation of fluids deserves mention. 
Haldane and Lorraine-Smith showed that, although the percentage 
of haemoglobin in the blood is diminished, the total amount in the 
body is normal; the anaemia is relative, and due to an excess of 
plasma. Therefore ]\Ielland suggested that a dry diet would cure 
chlorosis by concentrating the blood. Chlorotic persons often 
suffer from hydraemia; their tissues are laden with water, and the 
reduction of water would be beneficial to them. This may be done 
by dry diet or salt-free diet. Many chlorotic persons have a habit of 
drinking large quantities of tea or water, due to a primary poly- 
dipsia. If at the same time they take an excess of salt, or if clilorides 
are not properly eliminated, there will be retention of water in the 
tissues. Chlorotic persons sometimes have pufhness of the face, 
oedema of the extremities, and increase of weight. Moreover, it was 
observed by Moraczewski that in chlorosis the excretion of chlorides 
is sensibly diminished. It is advisable in such cases to restrict the 
fluids to I i or 2 pints daily, and avoid the use of salt, excepting the 
smallest amomit to flavour potatoes and vegetables. The blood 
may be further concentrated by using salines, whence arises the 
benefit derived from certain purgative waters and salts. Under 
this treatment there should be a reduction of body-weight, increased 
excretion of urine, increased firmness of body, greater freedom in 
respiration and movement. Wlien iron alone fails to cure, a com- 
bination with the salt-free and dry diet often has a beneficial result. 



PERNICIOUS ANJEMIA 505 

In Pernicious Anaemia the treatment must consist of absolute 
rest; rot in Ix'd bring prefi-rable, and country better than town. 
The diet should contain little farinaceous material, and a liberal 
allowance of meat, lish, fowl, rabbit, sweetbread, pheasant, par- 
tridge, tripe, etc., but especially raw meat, meat-juice, milk, junket, 
and eggs. If the stomach is irritable kephir or other forms of sour 
milk may be given for a time. If there is atony of the stomach or 
hyperchlorhydria, give the dietary for them. It should not be 
forgotten that pernicious anaemia is associated sometimes with 
achylia gastrica. Fenwick was the first to notice that patients who 
died of })ernicious anaemia had a marked atrophy of the gastric 
mucous meml^rane, and he believed achylia gastrica is the cause of 
pernicious anjemia; but recent writers do not agree with him. 'Ihe 
occurrence of achylia gastrica, however, necessitates the use of 
foods which will readily pass through the pylorus into the duodenum. 
Bone-marrow should be prescribed. Morgcnroth found the anaemia 
following poisoning by cobra-lecithide can be cured by cholesterin, 
and the hcxmolytic action of saponin can be prevented by it; and 
suggested the use of this as a remedy for pernicious anaemia. Guillan 
also says cholesterin diminishes the haemolysins of the blood. If 
cholesterin is capable of acting beneficially in this disease, it would 
prove pernicious anaemia to be a process of haemotysis. 

The theory that haemolysis is the cause of pernicious anaemia is 
not generally accepted, because there is no haemoglobin in the 
serum of urine, the ailment being commonly thought due to disease 
of the blood-making organs. Notwithstanding these objections, 
Klemperer^ tried cholesterin in the treatment of pernicious anaemia. 
He gave a 3 per cent, solution of cholesterin in oil, but patients did 
not like it, and could scarcely be induced to swallow it. Previous 
experiments taught him that the ingestion of milk, cream, and 
butter in large quantities caused an increase in the amount of 
cholesterin in the serum; i litre of cream and 200 grammes of butter 
correspond to 2-i grammes of cholesterin. These substances can be 
made into jellies, creams, and other articles of food well known to 
cooks, and when combined with ordinary mixed diet, are capable of 
exercising a marked effect on general nutrition. To enable the patients 
to digest large quantities of cream and butter, Klemperer prescribed 
small doses of brandy and a powder, consisting of calcium carbonate 
and calcium phosphate. Ebstein also considers fat in various 
forms hastens blood-formation, and that fatty and albuminous foods 
should figure largely in the diet. 

It should be pointed out that cholesterin is a normal constituent 
of all animal and vegetable cells; it is present everywhere, and is 
probably one of the essential foodstuffs, although we do not know 
the exact role played by it in the vital functions (see Vitamines). 
Milk contains o'ojiS per cent. ; it is present in blood, \"olk of egg, 
spleen, liver, and nerve tissues; in peas, beans, lentils, maize, 
wheat-gluten, Inirley-fat, almonds, peanuts, carrots, beetroots, etc.

5o6 DISEASES OF THE BLOOD AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS 

These are among the ordinary foods used in a mixed dietary for 
pernicious and other anaemias, and may be prescribed with the 
object of increasing cholesterin in the blood-serum. 

In leuksemia the dietary should be much the same as for any 
severe anaemia. If the digestion is poor, raw meat, meat-juice, milk, 
and kephir should be given ; in other cases light nourishing diet is 
the best. Milk and custards are beneficial; farinaceous foods should 
be restricted. Spirig, of Berhn, studied the assimilation of food 
in leukaemia in a patient whose blood contained 1,700,000 red and 
137.500 white corpuscles per cubic millimetre. A simple diet was 
given^ — meat, sausage, cheese, butter, bread, vegetables, etc. The 
nitrogen, fat, and carbohydrate in the food were determined, also 
the nitrogen in the urine, and nitrogen and fat in the faeces. He 
found the assimilation of nitrogen and fat was not so good as in 
healthy persons. The organism gained nitrogen, which he con- 
sidered to be in accord with Von Xoorden's theory that leukaemia is 
not a toxigenic protoplasmic disturbing disease. Burgliinski shows 
that the inhalation of 60 litres of oxygen per day considerably 
increased the metabolism of nitrogen in leukaemia, especially the 
proportion of uric acid to urea. Ihe use of X rays, as suggested 
by Senn of Chicago, has been found advantageous in both myelo- 
genous and lymphatic leukaemia, and the administration of arsenic 
and iodides has proved of value. The use of mineral waters, such 
as Bourboule, Krueznach, Salins des Bains, Salies-de-Bearn, etc., 
has been found beneficial. 

Plethora consists of general hyperaemia or total excess of the blood. 
It occurs when the blood-making organs are unduly active, or when 
the formation of blood is in advance of the normal destruction of the 
same. It manifests itself by a florid complexion, full colour of the 
mucous membranes, and overfulness of the capillaries and veins 
throughout the body, but particularly in the portal area. The 
excess of blood is used to a great extent in the formation of fat, 
which accumulates in the subcutaneous tissues and around the 
viscera. Overfulness of the portal vessels may lead to chronic 
hyperaemia of the liver, corpulency, and other diseases previously 
discussed. 

The Treatment consists in reduction of the total diet, particularly 
excess of meat and other protein foods. The condition would readily 
be met by reduction of the food to two meals a day,, about 6 ounces 
of solid food each time, besides vegetables and fruit. Beer, ale, 
stout, and excess of alcohol in other forms should be stopped. 
Skim-milk dietary, whey, buttermilk, and similar low diets are 
useful. Several of the diets given for the treatment of obesity 
might be employed, and a course of treatment at Harrogate or some 
other spa would be advantageous. 

Arterio-Sclerosis. — This disease is often, but not always, associated 
with chronic renal disease. A common factor in its production is a 
persistently high arterial tension, but this is not constant; some 
cases occur in which the tension is abnormally low. Huchard 



ARTERIO-SCLHROSIS 507 

divided the disease into tliree stages: (i) Presclerosis or arterial 
stage; (2) cardio-artcrial stage; (3) mitro-arterial stage. He con- 
sidered the disease " begins by intoxication/^continues by intoxi- 
cation, and ends by intoxication." The toxaemia is usually in- 
testinal in origin — aliment ary toxcemia — due to dietetic errors or 
excesses and the absorption of toxins, which the organs are unable 
to destroy or excrete. It frequently arises through hepatic in- 
sufficiency or failure of the liver to reduce toxins to less noxious 
substances. Huchard said: " The origin of the disease is alimentary, 
the lesion vascular, but the danger is renal." Experimental work 
supports these \-iews, but not entirely. Dunin of Varsovia got 
negative results in animals fed for months with substances supposed 
to cause this disease. It would be surprising if the results were all 
positively in favour of toxaemia, for arterio-sclerosis of alimentary 
origin takes many years to develop. But it has been shown con- 
clusively that the total amount of food, and especially the amount 
of }Motein consumed, has a direct influence on the blood-pressure. 

Diet. — The amount of food taken by a person with arterio-sclerosis, 
presclerosis, or hyperpiesis, should be somewhat less than an active 
person of the same age. If the patient has been a large eater, it 
may be necessary to cut the supply down to one-half he has been 
accustomed to take. The food should be less concentrated than 
that from a rich man's table. The total calorie value should be 
reduced b}- cutting out fat meat, rich or greasy foods, excess of 
butter, cream, cakes, puddings containing eggs, sugar, thick soup, 
and alcohol. The stout, obese person must cut down all foods alike 
(see Obesity) ; the gouty person will probably be benefited by reducing 
the proteins; and the thin person, who perhaps metabolizes carbo- 
hydrates badly, should reduce his allowance of sugar, starch, etc. 
.\ few general rules may be useful. 

(i) Ihe food should be as free as possible from bacteria; (2) it 
sliould not favour bacterial action; (3) the quantity should be 
moderate, especially the animal foods; (4) the patient must renounce 
tobacco, or take only an occasional pipe; (5) drink water between 
meals, to the extent of three pints a day; (6) use little alcohol; 
(7) avoid excitement, hurry, worry, and anxiety; go slow in all the 
actions of life; (8) wear woollen underclothing; (q) take daily exercise 
in the open air; (10) rise early, go to bed early. 

It is impossible to frame a diet suitable for all cases. Every food 
should only be added to the list after experimental observations. 
No article is suitable which increases arterial pressure. In many 
cases the meals must be small and frequent, so that the stomach is 
not overburdened or the heart embarrassed. As a general rule it 
is unnecessary to exclude meat entirely; a small helping may be 
taken with the midday meal. Milk should be taken to bring up the 
proteins to 60 or 70 grammes, with fresli vegetables and fruit. An 
absolute milk diet should not be recommended as a permanency; it 
contains too much lime; but a lacto-vegetarian diet should be pre 
scribed from time to time. The total amount of food should be such 



5o8 DISEASES OF THE BLOOD AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS 

as to satisfy hunger and prevent weakness. Tea, coffee, alcohol, 
and tobacco should be reduced in the same proportion as other 
foods. The food for each stage requires consideration. 

I. The Arterial Stage. — The chief symptom is hypertension; and 
the affection is called presclerosis, hyperpiesis, etc. The symptoms are 
due to alimentary toxsemia, constipation, or hepatic insufficiency, 
and they will yield to an absolute milk diet, or lacto-vegetarian diet 
(milk, cereals, green vegetables, fruit, and nuts). The total food 
should be cut down, the proteins being reduced to 60 or 70 grammes 
a day. After a few weeks of this diet we may allow some fresh meat 
and hsh, but the amount ought to be onl}- a small helping at the 
midday meal. The proportion of lime in milk is an objection to its 
use, but this may be counterbalanced by the consumption of oat- 
meal, which has a decalcifying effect. The potassium in vegetables 
has a decided effect on the kidneys, and even on the excretion of 
lime. The articles on Intestinal Dyspepsia and Alimentary Toxaemia 
should be read in connection with arterio-sclerosis. 

2. The Cardio- Arterial Stage. — There may be increased arterial 
tension, visibility and tortuosity of the arteries, accentuation of the 
second aortic sound, hypertrophy of the heart, and sometimes 
albumin and casts in the urine. We cannot cure the hyper- 
myotroph}' and thickened adventitia of the arteries, but a good deal 
can be done to relieve the heart and prevent the degenerative 
changes with which it is threatened. 

The total food should be reduced, and the protein kept down to 
70 grammes or less daily, as in the previous stage. 1 he diet should 
be such as will relieve the tension, prevent toxaemia, and act on the 
kidneys. In bad cases the patient should be put to bed for a week 
or ten days and given an absolute milk diet, theobromin or its com- 
pounds to act on the kidneys, and alkaline waters or pure distilled 
water. After this period some oatmeal should be added, and in a 
day or two the following diet may be prescribed: Milk 2 pints, 
oatmeal i^ ounces, a plateful of rice pudding, and some bread-and- 
butter. The future dietary must now be carefully considered. It 
must be a low protein diet. Ver}' little animal food should be taken. 
A lacto-vegetarian diet is the best. The excess of lime in milk will 
be counteracted by oatmeal, vegetables, and fruit. Lemon-juice 
has a special value in these cases, and therefore lemon-water is a 
useful beverage. Very little tea and coffee should be taken, because 
of the tendency of caffein to increase the blood-pressure. Theo- 
bromin is a proper remedy for the disease, and therefore cocoa is 
beneficial. Soup made from animal substances should be forbidden, 
because it may contain the pressor substances of meat, and these are 
injurious. Meat bases, purins, extracts of meat, meat wines, are all 
injurious. Vegetable soup may be allowed; any vegetable may be 
used for this purpose except mushrooms, truffles, morels, and those 
containing oxalic acid. A fragrant and palatable consomme can 
be made by boiling together six or seven of the following vegetables 
in water until the}' are quite soft: Carrots, turnips, parsnips, onions, 



.U{ Tl-.UinSCIJiliOSIS 509 

leeks, garlic, celery, chervil, lettuce, mint, thyme, marjoram, savory, 
tarragon, liay-leaf, salsify, endive, etc. Alcohol should be avoided 
altogether by most patients: but if arterial pressure is not very high, 
a glass of old port or sherry, sugar-free champagne, or spirit and water, 
at one meal a day may be benelicial. Water is the best beverage; 
it should contain very little lime — e.g., Perrier — or be distilled water — 
e.g., Puralis, Salutaris. Alkaline waters should be prescribed when 
distilled or non-calcareous water cannot be obtained. Alkaline 
waters dilute the blood and urine, flush the tissues, wash out toxins 
and waste materials, and promote the action of the kidneys and 
skin. But there are some cases, tlie kidneys being diseased, where 
the consumpti(jn of much liquid raises the blood-pressure and 
burdens the heart because the kidneys are unable to excrete water 
in proportion to that consumed. This group of cases may be 
benefited by " dry diet " and the exclusion of salt from the food 
(pp. 229, 236) . Tobacco ought to be given up by all men with arterio- 
sclerosis; it raises the blood- pressure. Dixon says: " A ferment is 
produced in the liver which counteracts the effects of nicotine." 
The pressor effect of nicotine in healthy persons is diminished by 
habit; but arterio-sclerotics are not healthy; there is hepatic in- 
sufficiency, and clinical observations support the recommendation of 
renunciation. 

3. r/?<? 3/ //ro-.^r/tY/rt/S/rtgt'.— The arterial resistance increases, and 
the heart continues to hypertrophy; in course of time the arterial 
resistance exceeds the cardiac power; the heart is exhausted, its 
cavities and orifices dilate, and the condition of dilated hypertrophy 
and mitral regurgitation becomes established. 

Rest in bed and absolute milk diet for ten to fourteen days is the 
best treatment for the present condition. Milk and oatmeal or 
farinaceous foods should then be given for several weeks. The patient 
soon tires of this diet. If it is intolerable after two weeks, allow an 
egg at breakfast, and a fillet of plaice, sole, or whiting at another 
meal; vegetable marrow, spinach, cauliflower, a few kidney beans 
(string or snap), seakale, boiled lettuce, and a small amount of 
bread, or dry toast, and butter. But milk ought to be the chief 
food for quite a long time. When the compensation becomes re- 
established, we can resume the former diet; but the state of the 
alimentary organs should be our guide. If gastro-intestinal catarrh 
is very marked, the patient should be put on the diet for that com- 
plaint. But if all is going on well, we may add to the foregoing 
some chicken panada or minced rabbit and mashed potatoes; and 
gradually return to the diet for the cardio-arterial stage, or for 
chronic heart disease. But, above all things, it is necessary that 
the diet of the arterio-sclerotic should be restricted to physiological 
requirements. The cardiac insufficiency, fatty heart, chronic 
nephritis, or alimentary toxaemia, which complicates the case, 
demand the dietetic treatment indicated under those headings. 

Milk Diet in Arterio-Sclerosis. — An exclusive milk diet acts like a 
charm in many cases of arterio-sclerosis by checking alimentary 



5IO DISEASES OF THE BLOOD AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS 

toxcemia, reducing blood-pressure, and increasing diuresis. I have 
no hesitation in recommending it, combined with rest in bed, for 
periods of three or four weeks at a time, in the mitro-arterial stage 
of the disease. 

The Lime-Poor Diet.^ — In 1897 Rumpf, confusing this disease with 
atheroma, condemned milk diet in the treatment of arterio-sclerosis 
on the ground that it contained too much lime, and prescribed a diet 
poor in lime for that disease. In 1906 Duckworth wrote: " The 
richness in lime salts renders abstention from milk somewhat 
imperative." In 1909 James Barr said: " To keep the blood- 
pressure low, lime salts should be eliminated from the diet, decalci- 
fying agents used, the skin and bowels kept acting. . . . When there 
is cardiac failure, lime salts must be used; but when compensation 
is re-established, their use should be discontinued." It should be 
pointed out, however, that it has not been proved that the blood 
and tissues retain calcium during the course of arterio-sclerosis. 
If at any time it is desirable to give a calcium-poor diet, it can be 
arranged by the use of the following table :

PERICARDITIS 511 

The Salisbury Diet. —Meat is a decalcifying food, and a course of 
the Siilishurv diet is beneficial in certain cases of arterio-sclerosis, 
especially when that disease is associated with other conditions 
necessitating that diet. Bertram fed a patient on meat, beer, and 
coffee; the calcium oxide in the food was 0385, in urine 0*167, ^'^ 
faeces 0233, grammes; and the daily loss of calcium was 
0015 gramme daily. In a second period he gave in addition 
40 grammes of potassium citrate daily; the calcium oxide in food 
was 0-385^ in urine 0095, in fseccs 0"2g5, and the daily loss was only 
o'OO20 gramme daily. 

Vegetarian Diet. — According to Ren vail, a supply of o-86o gramme 
of calcium oxide daily is sufficient for the requirements of the body. 
The food usually contains more than the body requires, and some 
of it may be retained. Gramatchikov showed that the calcium 
oxide in ordinary food is 260 grammes, in urine 036, in faeces 200, 
and the body retained 03 gramme daily. Various circumstances 
interfere with calcium metabolism— e.g., composition of the food, 
the activity of the excretory and metabolic glands. Phosphoric 
and citric acids increase the metaboHsm. A diet consisting largely 
of oatmeal increases the metabolism, and animals fed on oat- 
meal lose much calcium. The major part of the lime- is excreted 
through the intestinal mucosa, and a comparatively small amount 
through the kidneys. The effects of vegetarian diet are partly due 
to the salts of potassium. The diet of vegetarians often contains 
60 to 80 grammes of potassium chloride daily. Potassium sodium 
and lithium are antagonistic to calcium. They keep the calcium- 
protein compound in solution, and prevent its deposition. This is 
a point of importance in the treatment of atheroma, calcification, 
and arterio-sclerosis. Silicon is a constituent of cereals and other 
vegetables. Its importance is not clearly understood. According 
to Barrs, it is a decalcifying agent, and gives that property to 
oatmeal. Silicic acids are colloids which pass through animal 
membranes with difficulty; they form a large class of complex com- 
pounds. Silicates of the alkali metals are soluble in water, those 
of the alkaline earths in acids; but compounds of the two are 
insoluble in either water or acid. 

The Heart. 

Acute Diseases. — The treatment of pericarditis and endocarditis 
does not differ materially from that of the causative affection. The 
most common cause is acute rheumatism, and the diet should be 
the same as for that disease [q.v.). Three or four pints of milk daily 
in tumblerful doses, and an abundance of watery fluids, should be 
given. Oatmeal and other farinaceous^foods may be given, lemon- 
water, lime-juice and water, fruit-juice and water, weak tea, whey, 
buttermilk, wine-whey, etc., being allowed as extras. Lime-water 
and hard water containing much lime are not suitable. Objection 
has l)een raised to the prescription of milk and starchy foods, owing 



512 DISEASES OF THE BLOOD AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS 

to the amount of lime and formation of lactic acid in the digestive 
tract. But the combination of oatmeal and milk is a correct 
procedure. Minced meat, pounded chicken, and poached eggs 
have been recommended; but meat contains lactic acid (p. 288). 
Meat broths, and soups also contain it, and lish contains protic acid. 
The best diet undoubtedly consists of milk, oatmeal, and farinaceous 
foods, until the temperature is normal. Later on bread-and-butter, 
poached eggs, milk puddings, fruit, and vegetables may be gradu- 
ally added. Fish of the lighter kinds should be allowed when the 
patient can sit up, and meat when the patient can get out of bed. 

In ulcerative endocarditis the patient should have milk and 
barley-water, milk and soda or potash water, thin oatmeal gruel, 
and chicken or veal broth. Creatin and xanthin, in the form of 
broth, extract of meat, and meat essences, are useful stimiilants 
when the heart is failing. Broth should be made from fresh meat. 
If it is made from scraps of previously cooked meat it will contain 
an excess of lactic acid, which would be as injurious as xanthin is 
useful. Whipped eggs and alcohol may be given for a failing heart. 
The treatment of the underlying typhoid or pj^aemia is more 
important than the cardiac symptoms. 

Chronic Diseases. — Vahnalar diseases of the heart, when properly 
compensated, seldom come under the physician's notice. But when 
the physician knows of the existence of such disease, he should 
instruct his patient how to avoid indigestion, liver complaint, and 
alimentary toxaemia. The total food should be such as will meet 
the expenditure of the body- — no more ; the patient should avoid 
obesity. The allowance of protein should not exceed 80 grammes 
a day. Excess of purins and meat bases should be avoided. Heavy 
meals incommode the heart, flatulence embarrasses it, acidity of 
the stomach is injurious, and tends to catarrh of the alimentary 
mucosa and toxaemia. The following dietary is suitable for most cases: • 

Breakfast, 8 a.m. — One cup of tea or coffee; bacon and egg, or fish; bread, 
roll, or dry toast, 2 ounces ; butter ; some fresh fruit. 

Dinner, i /o i 30 p.m. — Soup, 2 or 3 ounces; meat, fish, or fowl, cooked 
plainly, without stuffing or forcemeat, and eaten with little salt or condiments; 
bread 2 ounces, potatoes; light vegetables — e.g., cauliflower, spring cabbage, 
spinach, asparagus, seakale, kidney beans, green peas, vegetable marrow, 
boiled lettuce, chard (no w-inter cabbage, savoy, Brussels sprouts, turnips, 
swedes, carrots, parsnips, beets, or salads). Simple milk puddings, custard, 
junket, jelly, stewed fruit, apple charlotte; cheese, i cubic inch if desired; 
fresh fruit. 

Tea-Time. — A cup of tea, rusk, biscuit, dry toast {no sweet cakes). 

Slipper, 7 or 8 p.m. — A light meal of fish (sole, plaice, whiting, brill, turbot, 
fresh haddock, skate, or other fish, containing 2 per cent, of fatj ; boiled ham 
and tongue; cold chicken; a spoonful of potato; stale bread-and-butter; 
simple pudding, custard, junket, stewed fruit, plain biscuit. (No pastry, 
cheese, or salad.) 

The consumption of foods likely to promote the formation of 
toxins must be avoided. Butcher's meat should only be taken once 
a da}'. Fish must be very fresh. Pork, veal, high game, entrees, 
stews, sheUfish, lobster, crab, tinned meat, meat pastes, caviar, 



CHRONIC VALVULAR DISEASE 513 

foic gras, mushrooms, trultlcs, strong cheese, tomatoes, sorrel, etc., 
should be forbidden. The food should contain little salt; condi- 
ments of all kinds should be reduced to a minimum. Tea, coffee, 
and cocoa should be taken in strict moderation. Tobacco should 
not exceed 2 ounces, and may advantageously be reduced to i ounce 
a week. The allowance of alcohol sliould be strictly limited to 
2 ounces or less per day. The total amount of fluids should be 
about 2 pints. An excess would distend the vessels, raise the blood- 
pressure, and overtax the heart; an insufficiency of fluids would 
tend to accumulation (;f waste materials in the body. 

Failure of Compensation. — ^Tlie cause of heart failure is weakness 
of its muscle. Any tendency to failure will be aggravated by 
indigestion, catarrh of the stomach, hepatic insufficiency or hyper- 
gemia, alimentary toxaemia, and the causes thereof. Abuse of tea, 
coffee, alcohol, or tobacco have a similar effect. Among poor 
people a dietary of bread-and-butter and tea, too little meat, or 
bacUy cooked food causes general debility, and the heart often sutlers 
more than other muscles. When failure is due to over-feeding or 
under-feeding, the heart will be improved by regulation of the diet, 
maintaining the protein at a proper level and by avoiding alimentary 
toxaemia. 

In temporary heart failure, indicated by dyspmjea, oedema of the 
ankles, etc., much improvement will follow attention to the gastro- 
intestinal functions and portal circulation (see Chronic Gastric and 
Intestinal Catarrh and Hepatic Hyperiemia). It may be necessary 
to order rest in bed. A milk diet will then be the proper treatment ; 
the lime in it will increase the tone of the heart. The formation of 
curds may be prevented, if it seems necessary, by adding barley- 
water, extract of malt, Benger's or some other farinaceous food to 
the milk; but citrate of soda should not be used. After eight or ten 
days the amount of milk may be reduced, some meat, fish, and light 
puddings may be allowed, and afterwards the diet for catarrh of 
the stomach may be prescribed. 

When compensation has broken down completely, a long rest in 
bed is essential. These cases are often difficult to feed. The body 
requires extra nourishment, but the alimentary organs are unable 
to deal with it. The mucosa is in a bad state, and there is usually 
hepatic inefficiency. Absolute milk diet for ten days should be the 
rule. Under its influence the digestive and hepatic functions will 
improve, the tone of the heart and the action of the kidneys increase, 
the hydnemic plethora diminish, the accumulated nitrogenous 
waste be excreted, and superabundant fat used up. If vomiting 
occurs, and is not checked by ordinary means, it is better to desist 
from gastric feeding for a short time and resort to rectal feeding {q.v.}. 
There is no doubt of the value of resting the stomach. Flatulent 
distension is avoided, cardiac strain relieved thereby, venous 
engorgement diminished, the dilatation of the heart is materially 
lessened, and the apex, often far displaced outwards, returns to its 
normal position after a week or ten days of rectal feeding. When 

33 



514 DISEASES OF THE BLOOD AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS 

the gastric intolerance abates, some peptonized milk may be given 
b}' the mouth in small doses, and from this time we may gradually 
increase the quantity of milk until 4 or 5 pints a day are 
consumed. 

The use of viilk in cardiac failure is imperative. Karell pre- 
scribed skim milk, beginning with j to ^ pint every three or four 
hours. Lenhartz prescribes a tumblerful of ordinary milk four 
times a day for the first five or se\-en days; he then adds one boiled 
egg and rusk or zwiebach for two to six days. After this he adds 
minced meat or fowl with light vegetables, and allows the patient 
to return to ordinary diet gradually. In my own practice I prescribe 
an exclusi\-e milk diet for five or six da3'S. After this period I order 
2 pints of milk daily in doses of a teacupful. These meals are 
alternated every two hours with a teaspoonful or two of raw minced 
beef, chicken cream or panada, oysters, beef -juice, and Brand's 
essence of beef. After a few days the patient is aUowed a small 
piece of steamed fish^ — e.g., sole, plaice, or fresh haddock, a table- 
spoonful of mashed potato, and some Benger's or Allenbury's food. 
Later on some crisp dry toast, rusk, or plain biscuit (cracker), and 
butter can be added, and from this basis a plain wholesome diet, 
suitable for catarrh of the stomach, may be gradually built up; but 
restrictions should be put on the amount of carbohydrate foods, 
tea, coffee, alcohol, and tobacco. 

The dry diet is valuable in many cases of chronic heart disease, 
especially when failure of compensation is associated with hydrsemic 
plethora. The consumption of much liquid is injurious by dis- 
tending the vessels, keeping -them overfiill, overtaxing the heart, 
and leading to anasarca and ascites. In the words of Oertel, the 
dry diet " diminishes the volume of the blood, increases its albumin, 
reduces the cardiac fat, strengthens the cardiac muscle, equalizes 
the venous and arterial blood, unloads the kidneys and pulmonary 
vessels, increases the breathing space, and overcomes the tendency 
to form fat in the thoracic and abdominal cavities." These objects 
are attained by reducing the fluid intake to 15 or 20 ounces: one 
cupful of tea, coffee, or cocoa at breakfast and tea time, a wine- 
glassful of wine with as much water at dinner-time, and 4 or 5 ounces 
of plain water with a tablespoonful of whisky or brandy in the 
evening. The food should consist of eggs, meat, fish, poultry, tripe, 
dry toast, rusks, or plain biscuits; at dinner a tablespoonful of 
mashed potato, and spinach or cauliflower, followed by a light 
pudding, and cooked or fresh fruit. 

Salt-free Diet. — Common salt is essential for metabolism, but the 
retention of salt in the tissues, owing to renal inadequacy, leads 
to hydraemic plethora or oedema of the tissues, and materially 
increases the work of the heart. Mendel says hydraemic plethora 
does not lead to oedema so long as the heart and kidneys are sound, 
but a failure in the circulatory system immediately leads to cedema, 
which is primarily due to hydraemia. The beneficial effect of ex- 
clusive milk diet in these cases is well known, but Romberg believes 



HYPERTROPHY AND DILATATION S^S 

tile effect is entirely due to absence of salt. Mendel supports this 
view, and considers the same effect may be obtained from salt- 
free diet. A diet consisting of 2^ pints of milk, 10 ounces of meat 
(cooked and eaten without salt), and 10 ounces of salt-free bread, 
and some fresh fruit, would only contain about j grammes of sodium 
chloride. With an ordinary diet a normal person excretes 15 to 
20 grammes of sodium chloride daily, but the food contains more 
than that quantity. The patient should remain in bed while taking 
this diet. When the tjedema is gone, some cauliflower, fresh-water 
fish, fat bacon or ham, and milk pudding can be added to the diet. 
The amount of salt will thus be increased to 6 grammes daily. 
From this time onward the patient should be instructed to take as 
little salt as possible. Cereals and fruits contain very little; milk 
puddings, custards, junkets, creams, omelettes made with sugar, 
and jelly, also contain little; ordinary bread and meat contain 
much more. 

The Adolescent Heart. — A constitutionally weak heart may occur 
in a person " made of poor goods," and such condition is usually 
part of general myasthenia. The adolescent heart, however, 
according to Herz, is due to a disproportion in growth, the heart 
and vessels being de\-eloped more slowly than the skeleton and 
those organs concerned with the production of internal secretions. 
These cases usually do well under a dietetic and hygienic regimen 
designed to supply the materials for growth, and to strengthen the 
organism in general. In spite of breathlessness and palpitation 
after exertion, such persons should gradually train themselves by 
muscular exercises within their power, avoiding strain, until their 
heart gains strength and they are able to perforin feats of endur- 
ance. 

The Athlete's Heart.^ — -This is a simple hypertrophy due to 
strain. It requires moderation in training and due attention to 
the diet. 

Senile Heart. — At the opposite extreme of life the heart often 
becomes enlarged when the muscular power of the body declines. 
Foster^ sa^'s: " The dynamic coefficient of the skeletal muscles 
diminishes rapidly after thirty or forty years of life, and a similar 
want of power comes over the plain muscular libres. The heart, 
though it may not diminish, or even increases in size and weight, 
possesses less and less force, and diminishes in vigour." 

The rules of dietary for the arterio-sclerotic should be impressed 
on the patient, ihe most important meal should be in the middle 
of the day, and an interval ol live hours should be made between 
meals. Dry diet is often useful. Alcohol should be dispensed with 
if possible. All meals should be light, and consist of easily digested 
foods. 

Hypertrophy and Dilatation. — As regards compensatory hyper- 
trophy, nothing more is needed than the remarks on chronic 
diseases of the heart. In cases of simple uncomplicated hyper- 

1 " Textbook of Physiology," iv. 1549. 



51 6 DISEASES OF THE BLOOD AND CIRCULATORY ORGANS 

tropli}-, a course of low diet and rest of bod}' are necessary. After 
this period, the keynote of hfe should be moderation. Small meals 
are better than large ones; they distend the stomach less, and do 
not embarrass the heart. 1 he stomach and bowels must be kept 
in order, lliere is probably a persistent arterial hypertension, 
which should be treated as for arterio-sclerosis. 

Dilatation shows the existence of weakness or degeneration of 
the myocardium. In simple dilatation due to anaemia or pyrexia, 
it will be sufficient to improve the quality of the blood and general 
nutrition. 1 he treatment for chlorotic anaemia is the proper one. 
In all other cases we must endeavour to maintain the tissues in the 
highest state of health possii)le, to enable Nature to resist the 
hydrostatic pressure resulting from derangement of the circulation. 
Ihe diet should be light and nutritious. A small amount of 
butcher's meat, fowl, fish, light vegetables, and fruit; eggs, custard, 
jeU)', blanc-mange, milk puddings, bread-and-butter, 'i he digestive 
organs must be carefully watched. All those articles to_be avoided 
in dyspepsia and alimentary catarrh should be forbidden now. 
If the arterial tension is high, or there is evidence of alimentary 
toxaemia, a lacto- vegetarian diet would be beneficial. The amount 
of sacchanne and fatty foods should be kept low. Liquids should 
be limited. A small amount of tea and coft'ee may be allowed. 
Persons who have been accustomed to alcohol may have a small 
amount of good wine or spirit. Ihe quantity should be fixed. 
Smokers may be allowed one ounce of tobacco a week^ — a pipeful 
twice a day. 

When the dilated heart fails, rest in bed is a necessity. An 
attack of bronchitis or gastric catarrh now often prostrates the 
patient. We may have to contend with nausea and distaste for 
lood. Some patients can swallow nothing that requires mastication, 
iiilk, therefore, must be the basis of the diet. The patient 
may object to it, but the hme-salts in it are of especial value now. 
Kuchard says the patient will not die because he takes milk, but 
he will die if he takes ordmary food. ]\Iost of the distressing 
symptoms are due to alimentar}- toxaemia; therefore milk is the 
proper diet. Such patients are often difficult to feed. If milk is 
vomited, mix it with barley-water, soda-water, or lime-water (but 
not with sodium citrate), to prevent formation of curds. If it is 
then rejected, avoid gastric feeding for a few days, and resort to 
rectal feeding. An absolute milk diet should be given for ten or 
fourteen dajs. It may be plain, raw, boiled, baked, or as junket. 
Alter this time give very small portions of custard, junket, jeUy, 
milk puddings, raw meat, raw ham, oysters, and gradually increase 
the quantity. Next give a bit of boiled sole or whiting, then breast 
of chicken or pheasant, tender mutton, under-cut of beef, and so 
on. As the patient improves, gradually reduce the quantity of 
fluids to I ^ or 2 pints a day, at the same time increasing the solids. 
This is exceedingly important when there is oedema or ascites. 
A little tea would be valuable to the patient, and alcohol may be 



MYOCARDITIS 517 

necessary. The greatest need for alcohol occurs in those patients 
who do not improve with drugs. It is an invaluable remedy 
when it has not previously been abused. The quantity should not 
exceed 2 ounces daily. This vsould be contained in 5 ounces of 
good brandy or whisky, and should be given in dessertspoonful 
or tablespoonful doses, well diluted. The advantages of alcohol 
are — It raises the force of the failing heart and steadies its action, 
it eases pain and dyspntea, it promotes sleep, it temporarily takes 
the place of food. The disadvantages are — It irritates the stomach, 
causes intolerance of food, congests the liver, excites the nervous 
system, and ultimatel}' damages the myocardium. But it is ex- 
ceedingly valuable, and nothing else answers quite the same 
purpose. 

Changes in the Cardiac Muscle {Myasthenia, Myocarditis, and 
Fatty Degeneration). — The best-known cause of myasthenia is in- 
fluenza. But it may be caused by other pyrexial diseases; also 
gout, rheumatism, syphilis, tuberculosis, and malaria; alimentary 
toxaemia, hyperthyroidism; alcohol, tobacco, etc., and many non- 
toxic causes of general debility. The gouty heart is cardiac myas- 
thenia in a gouty person. In fatty heart the muscular fibres have 
undergone a degenerative change. In all these cases, however, 
the dietetic treatment is similar. The digestion is usually feeble; 
atony of the stomach is common. The food, therefore, should be 
light and easily digested, but very nourishing. There should be 
an interval of five hours between the meals, but a small amount 
of extract of meat or a glass of wine may be allowed in the middle 
of the morning, a cup of tea in the afternoon, and a glass of spirit 
and water at bedtime. The food should be eaten as dry as possible, 
the principal liquids being taken an hour before meals. Dinner 
should be eaten in the middle of the day. 

Breakfast. — China tea or coffee with cream, no sugar [saccharin may be 
used); dry toast — thin, crisp, and buttered cold; one egg, bacon, or fish; 
and a little fruit. 

Dinner. — Any kind of meat, fish, or fowl, plainly cooked; light vege- 
tables, one potato ; custard, junket, jelly, cooked fruit [sweetened with 
saccharin) . 

Supper. — Similar to dinner. 

One of the complications of cardiac failure is torpidity of the 
liver, hepatic insufficiency, arising from venous engorgement. The 
liver has more to do than any other organ with carbohydrate 
metabolism. Therefore lighten the work of the liver by reducing 
carbohydrates. There is evidence that fats are badly absorbed 
in severe heart diseases; therefore, reduce the amount of fat. The 
reduction of fat and carbohydrate necessitates an increased consump- 
tion of protein. The patient must be urged to take more meat, 
one or two eggs, a pint of milk, oysters, and other nitrogenous foods 
to raise the total value of the food to 1,800 or more calories. Strict 
moderation in alcohol is necessary; comparatively few cases need it. 
The general tendency of alcohol is to disturb metabolism and cause 



5iS DISEASES OE THE BLOOD AND CIECULATOEY ORGANS 

degeneration of the tissues. But it is essential when the patient 
is confined to bed. Caution, however, should be exercised. The 
patient is conscious of the relief derived from it, and may ask for 
it whenever he becomes depressed or feels thoracic oppression. 
It is easy to pass the limits of usefulness, and to induce the reaction 
and depression resulting from excess of alcohol. A small amount 
of any kind of wine which suits the patient may be taken with the 
food. Perhaps the minimum for usefulness is 2 or 3 ounces of good 
wine, and the maximum 10 ounces daily. Good Burgundy or 
Rhine wine would be suitable, but it might, of covirse, be replaced 
by an equivalent amount of brandy or whisky. 

Tea and coffee should be taken in moderation only. Both con- 
tain about I '5 per cent, of caffein, therefore i ounce contains 
^ gramme; but an ounce of coffee would only make ij pints of 
" coffee," whereas an ounce of tea would make 4 pints of " tea " ; 
therefore, from this point of view tea is the safer beverage. More- 
over, the essential oil of tea dilates superficial bloodvessels and 
lowers blood-pressure ; that of coffee has the opposite effect. Cocoa 
is better than either of the foregoing in some cases. The theo- 
bromin is beneficial, it is diuretic and lowers blood-pressure, and is 
frequently prescribed as a remedy. It is better to boil " cocoa- 
nibs " in water or milk than to use powdery preparations. If the 
cardiac pressure suddenly drops, coffee and its caffein would be 
more valuable than tea or cocoa. 

The Oertel treatment by dry diet is valuable in many cases of 
myocardial degeneration. The objects are to reduce the volume 
of blood, increase the proportion of albumin, strengthen the cardiac 
muscle, equalize the arterial and venous blood, check the cardiac 
dilatation and degeneration, and remove fat from the heart, the 
abdominal cavity, and subcutaneous tissues. These objects may 
be effected by dry diet, combined with graduated exercises at an 
elevation of 2,000 feet above the sea-level. At this elevation less 
strain is thrown on the m3'0cardium, and there is a dilatation of 
the superficial vessels and accumulation of blood in the cutaneous 
area, to the relief of the pulmonary circulation. Of course, it is 
useless to recommend residence and exercise at a high altitude 
to a lady who has never walked in her life, or to a poor clerk or 
struggling shopkeeper. The lady may, however, benefit from a 
change of air, and the dry diet. The shopkeeper must be content 
to take his exercise at a lower elevation. In each case the fat 
may be reduced by the Banting-Harvey, Oertel, or Ebstein diets, 
or by a milk diet, the whole food being reduced rather than any 
special item. At the commencement of treatment great caution 
should be used as to the exercise. The patient should be ordered 
to walk up a gentle slope each da}', the distance and gradation 
gradually increased. The Nauheim or Schott method of treatment 
is of great value in these cases. The treatment consists of exercises 
and baths which can be used at home. It is most useful when the 
heart has lost tone or become flabby from sedentary occupation or 



FATTY HEART 519 

want of exercise in tlie open air, combined with portal congestion 
and alimentary toxaemia. Graham Steele says: " With a sedentary 
occupation and abstinence from exercise, combined with a good 
appetite, it is easy for certain individuals to pass into a condition 
remote from that known as ' litness.' No one expects ' good wind ' 
in a stout person ; and his ' bad wind ' is largely due to the condition 
of his heart, which has been debilitated. . . . One of the chief signs 
of the failing heart is the growing failure of ' wind.' Training will 
improve the voluntary muscles, and so, undoubtedly, will it improve 
the cardiac and respiratory muscles." 



CHAPTER XIX 
DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS 

The lungs are the chief centre for gas exchange. The amount 
of oxygen assimilated and carbon dioxide excreted increases from 
childhood to adult age, and declines with the acti\ity of the body. 
The amounts vary with the circumstances and condition. Muscular 
activity increases metabolism, also the oxygen absorbed and COg 
excreted. Rest reduces metabolism and diminishes the oxygen 
and COg. The consumption of food increases respiratory activity, 
especially about an hour after the principal meal. The respiratory 
quotient is greatest on a carbohydrate diet. Alcohol, tea, and the 
ethereal oils, diminish the output of COg. Fever increases the 
consumption of oxygen and output of CO2. 

Whatever interferes with respiratory activity is a serious hin- 
drance to metabolism. Diseases of the lungs diminish their 
capacity for respiratory purposes, and cause a diminution of the 
gaseous exchange. Therefore a perfect respiratory apparatus is 
necessary for the well-being of the organism. Interference with the 
respiratory function may be due to — (i) Changes in the air passages, 
(2) changes in the respiratory movements, (3) changes in the circu- 
lation through the lungs. 

Catarrh of the Air-Passages. — Catarrh of the nasal passages, 
larynx, trachea, or bronchial tubes obviously interferes more or 
less with respiration. There is no need to go into details here 
respecting these disorders. The exciting causes are well known. 
The fever diet, given in a subsequent chapter, is adapted for the 
treatment or influenza, colds, pharyngitis, laryngitis, and bronchitis, 
or acute bronchial catarrh. 

Chronic catarrh of any portion of the respiratory passages 
requires ordinary mixed diet of a nourishing character. Children, 
especially those who are scrofulous or rickety, should have plenty 
of new milk, scraped raw meat, or underdone tender meat, pounded 
chicken, fish, cod-liver oil, and salt baths. Adults require light 
nourishing food in which protein and fat figure well. Salted foods 
are beneficial in many cases. The ash of mucus contains more 
sodium chloride than the ash of blood. Mucus becomes less tenacious 
in a salt solution, and salt taken in water acts as an expectorant. 
But the saline waters, containing chlorides, are distinctly alterative. 
Alkaline carbonates are also valuable. Dilute alkaline solutions 
excite ciliar}' movements and re-establish the vibrations suppressed 

520 






BRONCHITIS 521 

by catarrh. Sulphur -waters also have a benelicial alterative effect. 
Alany alkaline, chloride, and sulphur waters, taken internally or 
used locally in a hne spray or pulverization, hasten the curative 
effect of other remedies. 

Pneumonia, Pleurisy, and Acute Bronchitis. — It was formerly 
the custom to treat these diseases with a low diet, consisting of 
beef-tea, mutton broth, water-gruel, rice-water, barley-water, toast- 
water, tea, jelly, lemon-water, etc. ; and when the body became 
profoundly weak, to prescribe huge doses of alcohol. A low diet 
is still recommended by some authorities. Thus one writer says 
for lobar pneumonia: " One and a half pints of milk or whey, i pint 
of soup, and one egg daily will represent a sufficiently full dietary." 
But if we examine the reports of experiments in metabolism, we 
shall find this meagre diet is very insufficient. Ewald made ob- 
servations on five cases of pneumonia, and found the excretion of 
nitrogen averaged I9'i3 grammes per diem, necessitating a supply 
of 15 to 2*0 grammes of protein per kilo of body- weight, or from 
112 to 126 grammes of protein daily, to maintain the nitrogen in 
equilibrium; and the combustion in the tissues was so great as to 
require from 2,500 to 3,000 calories to maintain the weight of the 
body. Instead, therefore, of diminishing the amount of nutri- 
ment, we ought to endeavour to meet the increased demands by 
giving such foods as the body can digest and assimilate. It has 
been shown that proteins and carbohydrates are nearly as well 
digested in fever as in health; but fat is not quite so well absorbed. 
We should therefore endeavour to give the typical fever diet [q-V.). 
Milk is the best food. Eggs are also valuable. Carbohydrates 
are especially valuable — e.g., farinaceous foods, sugar, lactose, 
glucose, extract of malt, etc. Jelly is useful. A little fruit juice, 
a few grapes, strawberries, or apple sauce may be given. The rules 
for the administration of stimulants should be adhered to. When 
the pyrexial stage is over, the solidity of the food should be gradu- 
ally increased until the diet for convalescence from fever is attained. 
But it should never be forgotten that an excess of solid food may 
cause indigestion, flatulence, discomfort, and perhaps catarrh of 
the stomach. Therefore the return to ordinary food should be very 
gradual. 

Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema. — Chronic bronchitis is a 
frequenth- relapsing catarrh of the bronchial tubes, occurring 
chiefly in the spring and fall. It may increase until it becomes a 
persistent bronchorrhoea. Bronchitis and bronchial catarrh are 
frequently associated with disturbances of the circulation, especially 
diseases of the heart. This disease is common in people over fifty 
years of age. It occurs in the rich who live too well and sit all day, 
and in the poor who work hard and are not well fed, who are 
exposed to vicissitudes of the weather, to irritating fumes, noxious 
gases, and dust, especially industrial dust. 

\\'h.en elderly and working peojile suffer from chronicjironchitis, 
tiiey ought to have a light diet of a very nourishing character. 



522 DTf^FASFS OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS 

The food should be varied to encourage appetite. Meat and i. 
are necessary. An excessive amount of sweet foods, such as caket 
puddings, and cooked fruit, would be injurious; but plain milk 
puddings, bread-and-butter puddings, custards, etc., would be 
correct. A generous wine, such as Burgundy or port, would be 
useful, and an occasional dose of whisky is beneficial. If the 
catarrh is due to cardiac disease, the dietary detailed under that 
heading should be adopted; if there is gastro-intestinal catarrh or 
hepatic insufficiency, the dietary for those disorders should be 
adopted. 

When bronchial catarrh afflicts the wealthy, a different method 
of treatment is often necessary. Such people often eat and drink 
too much, and take too little exercise. It is generally useless to 
send them to bed for their catarrh. They often have evidences of 
hepatic insufficiency, possibly a large liver, and hsemorrhoids. In 
these cases the intake of food and output of energy must be made 
to balance. A spare diet, reduction of alcohol, and increase of 
exercise must be insisted on. Ebstein's or Oertel's diet should be 
prescribed, spirits should be forbidden, and very little wine allowed. 
Exercise must be ordered. It must be taken slowly at first, but 
gradually increased in rapidity and duration. Walking is the best 
mode of exercise. A course of waters at Harrogate, Pitkeathly, 
Marienbad, or Carlsbad, would be beneficial. 

Bronchial trouble comes to many people with an increase in 
weight. Obesity causes dj^spnoea or breathlessness on exertion. 
This tends to sitting down, which in turn causes increase of obesity 
or fatty heart, and chronic bronchitis and emphysema are gradu- 
ally evolved. In these cases the treatment should really be that 
of the main cause — obesity. There is no need to repeat the direc- 
tions given for that complaint. We must bear in mind the asso- 
ciated enfeeblement of digestion. The carbohydrates ought to be 
reduced to half the usual allowance, and proteins increased some- 
what. The Banting, Von Noorden, Ebstein, or Oertel diet may 
be instituted. The retention of fat in the diet is useful in bron- 
chitis. Cod-liver oil has a long time figured among the remedies 
for this disease, and we cannot suppose its curative effect is entirely 
due to the trace of iodine. Ebstein's diet contains more fat than 
Oertel's, and is preferable. The milk cure may be adopted when 
abdominal plethora is very marked. The whey-cure and grape- 
cure have also been found useful in the same kind of cases. When 
the weight is diminished, there should be a permanent reduction of 
carbohydrates, especially potatoes and other starchy foods, and 
many extra or unessential items of food should be forbidden. 

Chronic Pleurisy, Hydrothorax, etc. — Ordinary light food of 
nutritious character, and sufficient in quantity to prevent emacia- 
tion and increase strength, is essential. But two special diets are 
suitable for these conditions. The " dry diet " and the " salt- 
free diet " detailed in the chapter on special diets and elsewhere 
have a beneficial effect by promoting the absorption of the fluid. 



ASTHMA 'i2?, 

fjwsthma. -Asthma is due to a constriction of the bronchial 
Jiann(>ls. \'arions theories have been put forward to explain its 
occurrence. The theory of Reisseison, that it is due to muscular 
spasm of tlie bronchi, was long held ; but Weber's theory of hyperccmia 
and tumefaction of the mucous membrane is supported by many 
authorities. Williams, on the other hand, says the dyspncea is 
due simplv to an exapjgeration of the rhythmical contraction and 
dilatation of the tubes which occur in normal conditions. The 
disease is often associated with toxic causes^ — e.g., alimentary 
toxaemia. Rright's disease, etc. ; or obstruction arising from adenoids, 
ethmoiditis, or hypertrophic rhinitis. Laryngismus stridulus of 
children, also called " asthma thymicum," " asthma laryngeum," 
"spasm of the glottis," etc., is probably a reflex phenomenon. 
Asthma may also be associated with emphysema, organic disease 
of the heart or kidneys, uterine derangements, and various obscure 
causes. Many causes of asthma are curable, and an endeavour 
should be made to bring this about. 

Treatment— {i) During the Attack. — The most efficacious dietetic 
procedure, using that phase in a wide sense, would be the inhala- 
tion of compressed air or oxygen. A cylinder might be kept in 
readiness for the patient's use. Strong coffee is also very efficacious 
in some cases. It should be made from Mocha berries in the pro- 
portion of 2 ounces to J pint of boiling water. Romberg found 
sucking small pieces of ice afforded relief, and the application of 
ice in a towel along the course of the pneumogastric nerve in the 
neck gave relief in five minutes. Alcohol in the form of spirit and 
water (gin, brandv, or whisky) gives relief in many cases. But the 
tendency to form a habit renders alcohol a dangerous remedy. 

(2) Between the Attacks.— V\d.m mixed food is the best. It should 
consist of easily digested protein and carbohydrate foods. Many 
patients have idiosyncrasies to special articles. In such persons 
an attack may be precipitated by eating eggs, pork, lobster, truffles, 
and asparagus; therefore these things should be avoided. We 
cannot tell beforehand what will be the effect of any kind of food. 
Every addition to the diet must be experimental. Gluttony or 
carelessness in the diet will bring a speedy punishment. The asth- 
matic person must sacrifice his desires, incHnations, and tastes. 
A long list of articles to be forbidden might be made out. They 
have already been given under indigestion and liver complaint 
{q.v.). A few articles which should be forbidden may be especially 
mentioned— ^.g., pork, veal, hashed meat, entrees, rich sauces, 
salmon, eel, mackerel, and other heavy fish, lobster, truffles, aspara- 
gus, pastry, boiled puddings, suet dumplings, cheese, nuts, dried 
fruits, pickles, spiced sauces, and an excess of sweet foods. After 
forbidding these articles, attention should be given to the effects 
produced by other foods, and a suitable dietary built up by a process 
of exclusion. In one case it will be found that asthma is induced 
by an excess of all kinds of carbohydrates, especially sweet foods, 
causing flatulence, distending the stomach, interfering with respira- 



53 4 DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS 

tion, and reflexly causing dj'spnoea. In another case, butter and 
fatt\' foods disagree. Foods cooked in fat should in all cases be 
taboo. In a third case, animal foods maj' be responsible for the 
attacks. Thus we may be led to prescribe a lacto-vegetarian or 
sour-milk diet for one, purin-free diet for another, ordinary light 
nourishing diet for the debilitated, or meat and hot water diet for 
the gouty. Alimentary toxaemia can be held in check, reflex 
nervous asthma prevented, and the debilitated person cured. The 
total amount of food should not be too low. Some asthmatic persons 
consume too little, to the detriment of their general health. Four 
light meals, not too bulky, are better than two or three heavy meals. 
The heaviest meal should be in the middle of the day. The supper 
should be light, not late, say two or three hours before bedtime. 
Eating between meals should be forbidden. Thus the stomach will 
not be overloaded, taxed by indigestible foods, or irritated by 
condiments, spices, and alcohol; and a feeling of bien-etre will be 
encouraged. Animal food may consist of tender lean beef or 
mutton, chicken, pheasant, guinea-fowl, rabbit, and white fish. 
Milk sauce, onion sauce, apple sauce, or jelly may be eaten with 
them. Potatoes may be eaten in moderation, especially baked ones. 
Cauliflower, spinach, spring cabbage, boiled lettuce, chard, seakale, 
and tomatoes ma}' be allowed. Heavy vegetables should only be 
taken as a puree. Milk puddings, custard, junket, and cooked 
fruits may be eaten in moderation. Very little fluid should be 
taken with the food. It may consist of tea or coffee for break- 
fast ; plain water, a glass of hock, claret, dry champagne, or even a 
small amount of spirit and water for dinner. Sweet wines, strong 
wines, beer, ale, and porter should be forbidden. The chief drink 
should consist of J pint of hot water with a little common salt and 
bicarbonate of soda half an hour before the meals. 

The patient must avoid excitement and ought to live in a pure 
atmosphere. The sea-coast or mountain air is preferable, and the 
country is better than the town. Many people have been cured of 
asthma by removing from a dusty or smoky manufacturing district, 
and others relieved by going from a low-lying country district to 
live in London or some other city. 

Hay Asthma or Hay Fever requires dieting in a similar manner 
to spasmodic asthma. 



CHAPTER XX 

TUBERCULOSIS 

This chapter will deal with the dietetics of tuberculosis in general, 
as well as acute and chronic phthisis (pulmonary tuberculosis). 

The predisposition to tubercle is strongest in persons of feeble 
and delicate constitution. But people who usually possess good 
health are not permanently immune to this infection. A simple 
catarrh, catarrhal pneumonia, or whooping-cough, may prepare a 
nidus for the reception and propagation of tubercle bacilli. A 
feeble, ill-nourished body is in greater danger of tuberculosis than 
a healthy, vigorous, and well-nourished body, because the nutrition 
is easily disturbed, and the cells proliferate rapidly with the pro- 
duction of feeble descendants. The lymphatic glands, especially 
in children, participate in this irritability and morbid tendency to 
proliferation of the cells. They readily enlarge, and suppuration 
is easily provoked. Such persons are said to be scrofulous, and are 
very prone to infection by tuberculosis. Moreover, this delicacy 
of the cellular elements is transmissible from parent to child, 
wherefore it is said consumption is hereditary. It is better to say, 
" There is an hereditary susceptibility to consumption." The child 
of tuberculous parents ma}' be born with evidences of the disease, 
in which case it is congenital, although W. B. Ransom believed this 
to be rare, and said if the disease is developed later in life, it is 
probably acquired. Lazarus-Barlow^ says: "It is certain the 
semen of tubercular persons may contain tubercle bacilli; but the 
direct infection of the ovule is doubtful." Kanthack" also doubts 
this mode of causing congenital tuberculosis, and considers the 
mother is first infected. Nevertheless, the wives of tuberculous 
men frequentl}' escape the disease while their children inherit it, or 
a special susceptibihty to it. Placental tuberculosis is not rare, 
and therefore a tuberculous mother may directly infect her child.^ 
Tubercle bacilli introduced into the organism during foetal life may 
remain latent and develop in later life. " Latency " has been ob- 
served in syphilis and leprosy in human beings; it has been observed 
in the lower animals — e.g., pebrine in silkworms; and also in vege- 
tables — e.g., potato disease. 

The inheritance of susceptibility was long held the chief cause of

tuberculosis in the children of tubercuku" parents. Ransom con- 
sidered " a special susceptibility is not necessary, and its existence 
is not proven." But we cannot deny the transmission of acquired 
characteristics. Evolution is a proof of its occurrence. Lazarus- 
Barlow says: " If the inheritance of parental characteristics is 
borne in mind, the possibility of such an explanation cannot be 
denied." 

Tubercle in the parents is not the only cause of susceptibility to 
the disease in the offspring. Ihe child's tissues may be rendered 
susceptible by improper diet, hunger and want during the period 
of growth, absence of fresh air, living in badly ventilated and over- 
heated rooms, or frequent exposure to wet and cold. Adults are 
rendered susceptible by the same causes. A person born with a 
sound constitution rarely becomes infected while the body remains 
well nourished and the cells retain their normal characteristics. 
But when the tissues get into such a condition that wounds do not 
readily heal, the organism has undergone a change; the cells have 
lost their vigour and cannot resist infection; the phagocytes are 
no longer able to overcome the invading bacilli; the immunity is 
broken down; the antibodies — alexins, opsonins, agglutinins, 
amboceptors, or whatever name we give them — are dehcient, and 
tubercle bacilli work their way into the blood and tissues, and cause 
the morbid changes characteristic of tuberculosis. Ihis condition 
is favoured by alcoholism, insufficient food, prolonged discharges, 
suckling, sexual excesses, syphilis, clilorosis, ulcer of the stomach, 
various disturbances of metabolism, immoderate study, and 
depressing mental conditions. 

ihe infection may be acquired through the air or food. Ex- 
posure to an atmosphere charged with tubercle bacilli renders the 
risk of infection great. Household dust consists largely of organic 
matter, and is one of the chief sources of tuberculous infection, 
especially when tuberculous persons are careless in regard to their 
sputum. Industrial dust is another source of infection. An 
analysis of 2,161 cases of tubercle showed that 1,095 cases were 
associated with the inhalation of dust during occupation. The 
chief sources of food infection are meat and milk. The flesh of 
tuberculous animals is not necessarily infectious — in fact, muscular 
tissue rarely contains deposits of tubercle. But tubercle bacilli 
abound in the lymphatic glands, and it is the presence of these little 
organs which makes the consumption of tuberculous meat dangerous. 
Besides muscular tissue, the lungs, udder, mesentery, and other 
organs are consumed by the poor. These are often mfected, and 
are a source of danger. Experiments by Sims Woodhead showed 
that tubercle bacilli in these tissues are destroyed when they are 
cooked at a proper temperature ; but he made rolls of meat, such as 
are sold by the butcher, and placed infected tissues in them, and 
found that a joint weighing 6 or 7 pounds did not attain a higher 
temperature than 140° F., and was not sterihzed throughout; and 
a roll of 3 or 4 pounds of meat might not become sterile m ordinary 



I'REVENTiriVE TREATMENT 527 

cooking. W'itli these exceptions, the ordinary methods of cooking 
are more or less a safeguard against infection. 

Tuberculosis may be transmitted from cattle to human beings 
by means of milk. It is probable that a large proportion of tubercle 
of the glands, bones, brain, and serous membranes is derived from 
this source. Von Behring said the chief cause of tuberculosis in 
man is the contraction of bovine tuberculosis in infancy, through 
being fed on milk, and such tuberculosis is often latent and develops 
in adult life. Koch denied this strenuously; but the British Royal 
Commission afterwards decided that milk is a source of tubercle 
to mankind, and is one of the causes of the high mortality from 
this disease in children. Nevertheless, seeing the importance of 
this fluid for feeding infants, children, and invalids, we ought jiot 
to forbid its use, but should endeavour to secure a pure milk- 
supply. 

Prophylaxis. — The marriage of healthy persons, nearly of an 
age and not related to each other by blood, is essential to avoid the 
risks of tuberculosis in the offspring. Children born of tuberculous 
or scrofulous parents should be subjected to a regime which will 
tend to eradicate the susceptibility or render the soil unfit for the 
propagation of tubercle. 1 he milk of a healthy woman is the best 
food for an infant; but tuberculous mothers ought not to suckle 
their young. A wet-nurse, providing she is free from taint of tubercle 
or syphilis, is the best substitute for the mother. When woman's 
milk is not obtainable, the child must be fed in the manner in- 
dicated in the chapter on Infant Feeding. Milk of the cow, goat, 
ewe, or ass should form a principal part of the diet after the period 
of dentition until the child can take an adequate portion of minced 
meat, fowl, or fish. The diet in cliildhood should be generous, 
and contain a large proportion of proteins. It was formerly 
thought bread and potatoes favoured the development of tubercle; 
and so they may do, when the protein is deficient, but they are very 
valuable sources of minercd salts. Oatmeal is a stimulant of 
metabolic activity and growth, and, when combined with milk, 
is an admirable food. Fat should hgure well in the diet to meet the 
demands of the organism for energ}^ and, as Sawyer says, " to 
feed the cells which eat bacilli." Cod-liver oil is largely prescribed 
for delicate children, but every child is not benefited by it. It is 
usual to divide children havnig a predisposition to tuberculosis 
into two groups: (i) The scrofulous type — fair, coarse-skinned, 
muddy-looking, rather fat, clumsy, and slow both mentally and 
bodily, i hese are not benefited by cod-liver oil, even when they 
exhibit enlarged glands. It upsets their stomach, deprives them 
of appetite, and hmders nutrition. They frequently show a distaste 
for fatty foods, which is considered a harbinger of tuberculosis. 
(2) The tubercular type — dark-haired, beautiful children, thin, 
slender, having a clear skin through which the veins are visible, 
excitable, mentally quick, and of great bodily activity. These 
children, as a rule, derive much good from cod-liver oil. If they 



528 TUBERCULOSIS 

have a distaste for it at iirst, it is soon overcome, and they speedily 
become accustomed to it. They should have it for months together, 
leaving it off for a few weeks, and then again taking it. The initial 
dose should be small and gradually increased until they can take 
tliree or four teaspoonfuls daily. Emulsions of cod-liver oil and 
malt may be used. 

Baths are beneficial to such children, and it so happens that those 
who cannot take cod-liver oil are most benefited by them. Sea- 
w^ater, sea-salt and water, brine baths, bromo-iodine and sulphurous 
waters, are better than plain water. They are justly esteemed 
alteratives and promoters of metabolism. Fresh air and exercise 
are equally important. 

In adults the defensive powers of the organism may be increased 
by similar measures to the foregoing. High feeding is one of the 
best means of promoting metabolism, encouraging the formation 
of healthy tissues, and forming the antibodies essential to protect 
the organism. The feeding of a person believed to have a pre- 
disposition to tuberculosis or suft'ering from pre-phthisis, should be 
carried out in exactly the same manner as a petson in whom the 
disease actually exists. Meat, fowl, milk, and various forms of 
fat should be generously prescribed. Want of appetite, nausea, 
vomiting, distaste for fatty foods are evidences of that catarrh 
of the stomach which is common in pre-phthisis. Due attention 
must be paid to this condition. The stomach must be coaxed and 
even indulged to a certain extent. Medicines must be given to 
a]d its recovery, to promote appetite, and encourage the alimentary 
secretions. If milk disagrees, those means must be adopted to 
modify the fluid which have been so often detailed. The milk of 
animals fed on mountain pastures is richer in protein and fat than 
other milk. Therefore the milk cure in a district where goats, 
ewes, and asses are the common source of milk is commendable. 
The ancient custom of taking new milk, fresh and warm from the 
cow, has the support of science. Such milk, when the animal is 
healthy, is the richest in vitamines, enzymes, alexins, and other 
antibodies. T herefore it may suffice to send the patient to a farm- 
house where the milk may be obtained. 

The importance of living in a pure atmosphere and of freedom 
from danger of infection by tuberculosis cannot be too strongly 
urged. A person having a known susceptibility to the disease 
should not live in the same house as a tuberciilous person, and 
most certainly should not occupy the same bedroom. J'uberculous 
persons must use a proper spit-bottle, which should be disinfected 
daily. Removal from town to country, a long sea voyage, a resi- 
dence in a warm, dry climate, are proper recommendations. If a 
person must work, he may find suitable employment in the high- 
lands of Canada, in California, Colorado, South Africa, New Zealand, 
or other places reputed to be curative. By such means the pre- 
disposed person may so improve his health that the threatened 
invasion will not occur, or that the invader will be overcome. 



TREATMENT OF CHILDREN 529 

Treatment of the Tuberculous Child. — Phthisis is not prevalent 
among \oung (iiildrcn, l)ut niodtrn mctliods of diagnosis show that 
a large proportion of children are tainted. Hamburger of Vienna 
applied Von Pirquet's cutaneous test to 509 children. Not one 
child under a year old gave evidence of the disease; but from one 
to eleven years of age there was a steady increase in the reactions, 
and 90 per cent, of eleven year old children reacted. Hamburger 
says: " Tuberculosis is a true children's disease. Almost everyone 
acquires it some time, and mostly during their earlier years." 
Kelynack who found 8 per cent, of children tuberculous at one 
year old, says: " The tissue soils of infancy and childhood afford 
good ground for the seeds of tuberculosis, which exacts a heavy 
toll on life's earlier years." Engel says Von Pirquet's test shows 
tuberculosis is comparatively rare in infants at the breast, but 
increases in frequency with age, until at puberty about half the 
children are affected." In infancy the disease is a generalized 
tuberculosis. From infancy to puberty the glands are almost 
always first affected, the bronchial glands included. At puberty 
the glands cease to be seriously affected, and pulmonary phthisis 
becomes more common. Tuberculosis in adults is often due to a 
recrudescence of tuberculous lesions which have slumbered since 
childhood. 

Tuberculous children should live mostly in the open air. Sun- 
shine is of importance to them. The sanitary arrangements of the 
house should be perfect. Warm clothing, regular exercise, and 
baths are essential (vide Prophylaxis). They should be protected 
from measles, whooping-cough, mumps, and all diseases which 
depress the vital powers. 

The food should be good and abundant. Protein and fat should 
figure largely in the diet. Protein should be in the proportion of 
2 '5 to 3 grammes per kilo, or i'^ grammes per pound of body-weight. 
It should be derived mainly from animal foods. The requirements 
of children given in the chapter on Feeding of Children, should 
form the standards. The animal foods should consist of milk, 
eggs, egg-flip, custard, junket, milk-jelly, milk puddings, minced 
raw meat, meat-juice, ordinary cooked meat (scraped or minced 
for young children), chicken cream or panada, pounded fish w-ith 
cream or butter. Plenty of fat should be given in form of butter, 
cream, cod-liver oil, olive-oil, peanut-oil [arachis), suet, and boiled 
fat bacon. Bone-marrow is especially good. It should be eaten 
raw, spread on bread, seasoned with salt, or put into soup or 
porridge. When milk is not taken readily, it can be partly replaced 
by raw eggs and cream; by dried milk [e.g., Tniemilk, Cow and 
Gate brand, etc.) ; by casein preparations (Protene, Sanatogcn, 
Plasmon) ; or meat powder (" meatox "). Carbohydrates should 
consist of milk puddings, standard bread {wholemeal) , and oatmeal 
porridge. It has been shown that certain bodies called " vita- 
mines," in unbolted flour and oatmeal, are important provocatives 
of growth and metabolism; therefore these materials should be 

34 



S30 TUBERCULOSIS 

prescribed in preference to tine flour, white bread, or fine oatmeal. 
Sugar, jam, marmalade, treacle, and honey are excellent carbo- 
hydrate foods, and ought to be allowed without stint as a means 
of encom-aging the consumption of bread or porridge. Starchy 
foods — e.g., sago, tapioca, arrowroot, and cornflour- — are not as 
a rule so good for tuberciiloiis children. Instead of puddings made 
of them, children ought to have plum-dufl", suet dumplings, and roly- 
pol}- jam puddings, in all of which suet is incorporated. Care must 
be taken that the suet is shredded very fine. As a general rule, 
when a child rebels against suet puddings, cold boiled bacon, and 
other fatty foods, it will be found that he is suftering from gastric 
catarrh. When this is the case, the lighter mflk puddings — e.g., 
rice, sago, and tapioca — must be given while the stomach recovers. 
At the same time the parents should be warned that an excess of 
sugar, jam, etc., may cause such catarrh, and these should also be 
temporarih' forbidden. 

The feeding of delicate children is an awkward problem for the 
families of the poor. There are many children in England who get 
ver}' little meat, and who never taste milk except during illness. In 
such cases we must recommend skim milk, if other cannot be got ; and 
soup made of pea-flour or lentils and flavouring herbs. These are 
good sources of protein. Foreign meat is much cheaper than English 
meat, and should be used when the home product cannot be ob- 
tained. In Scotland the national diet is oatmeal and milk. For 
centuries the stalwart men of the North were fed on this diet. There 
is evidence that the custom is dying out, and this would be a 
calamity to the peasantry. The poor of Ireland are badly fed. 
J. D. Wynne, writing about tuberculosis, says: "The food of great 
numbers of the poor people in Ireland is deficient in nourishing 
properties. The potatoes and tea of the Irish peasantry form a 
diet very inferior to the oatmeal and milk so largely consumed 
in Scotland." Hussey, in his " Reminiscences of Ireland " (1904), 
says: " Defective dietary has been reducing our national stamina 
for forty years. Previous to that time our peasantry were robust 
and little troubled with consumption. They lived on bread made 
from home-grown wheat, milk, potatoes, and stir-about. Now 
they live for the most part on tea and bread made from imported 
flour, and milk is not obtainable." The ph3'Sician, therefore, must 
think over the dietary of his peasant patients, and carefully con- 
sider the cheap sources of protein and fat, for these are the most 
expensive articles (see p. 538). 

Treatment of the Tuberculous Adult. — When tuberculin tests 
are used, a large amount of " unrevealed " tuberculosis comes to 
light. These cases are more numerous than those " revealed " 
by physical signs. i\Iany cases called prephthisis, or merely having 
a predisposition to the disease, would be pronounced tuberculous 
after a tuberculin test. The seat of election in adults is the pul- 
monary apex. Here the first symptoms of tubercle usually present 
themselves. There may, of course, be tubercle in the bones, 



TREATMENT OF ADULTS 531 

glands, and other organs. But so far as treatment by diet is con- 
cerned, it matters not what part is primarily affected. The food 
required is practically the same. Many persons recover from the 
disease. Small masses become transformed into fibroid tissue; 
larger masses calcify; cavities contract and cicatrize. Some 
patients remain well only a short time, others for many years, and 
some are permanently cured. To encourage the healing process 
by raising the standard of health and prevent fresh infection or 
auto-infection is the object of all treatment. With treatment by drugs, 
tuberculin, or vaccine, etc., we have nothing to do in this book. 

The diet of a tuberculous person should be carefully planned. 
The food should be generous. But the patient will derive no 
advantage from a great accumulation of fat in the tissues. An 
increase of adipose tissue does not add strength to the body. It 
may increase dyspncea and prevent much needed exercise. A great 
change has come over medical opinion in regard to the diet. Writing 
in 1835, Clark said: " Overfeeding is a prevailing error. A delicate, 
puny girl of seven, with strumous constitution, is given the same 
dinner as a robust youth of seventeen, and both are given as much 
meat as is adapted only to persons of adult age and matured 
strength. During the early stages of phthisis the diet ought to be 
mild and even antiphlogistic; as the disease advances the diet must 
be regulated with the circumstances. It is erroneous to suppose 
emaciation can be checked by an additional quantity or increased 
quality of food. ... In many cases a change from mild to stimu- 
lating diet would interfere with the curative process." Stokes 
said the diet ought to be of the least stimulating kind — milk, farin- 
aceous foods, and hght vegetables; but milk is of more value than 
the whole materia medica. Graves (1840 to 1850) rebelled against 
this regimen, and said: " Make your patients lay aside slops and tea; 
let him take fresh meat three times a day, wholesome bread, and 
good beer." Trousseau gave the same advice, but Clarke 
strenuously opposed it. Watson at a later date considered a low 
diet should be prescribed when there are signs of inflammation, 
a full and generous diet when the disease is spreading. " The 
commonest error," he said, " is that of reducing strength by need- 
less restriction of nutriment." At the present day, full and 
generous feeding is the rule. The diet should contain a large 
proportion of protein, 2 to 3 grammes per kilo, and total energy 
of 50 or 6c calories per kilo. But even at the present time there 
is great variation in the diet. Irving Fischer ^ found in ninety-six 
sanatoria that the protein prescribed varied from 160 to 300 grammes, 
and the total energy of food from 2,500 to 5,000 calories daily. 
There has of recent years been a reaction against forced feeding, 
and the higher quantities are not generally prescribed. 

Experiments have shown that proteins have greater effect in 
arresting tuberculosis than carbohydrates or fat. They are more

of Tuberculosis, 1906. 



532 TUBERCULOSIS 

stimulating, provoke metabolism in the cells, and a more rapid 
change of the body. It used to be said that no particle of the 
human body remains the same for more than seven years. This 
is only true in the aggregate. We know, however, that effete cells 
are destroyed and new ones are formed. If the diet induces more 
rapid changes, it may chance that the new cells will have more 
tone, strength, or vitality, and greater power to resist the tubercle 
bacilli and toxins. It is believed that these changes are provoked 
b}' proteins, and therefore proteins should form a large proportion 
of the food. A man of average weight should have 150 to 180 
grammes daih^ 

Animal foods are more stimulating than vegetable foods. All 
kinds of meat ma}- be taken — beef, mutton, lamb, poultry, game, 
fish, oysters, eggs, and milk. Meat is better underdone and even 
raw. More meat can be consumed when it is minced or scraped, 
than when slices are cut from a joint. Raw meat may be eaten 
without being scraped if it is preferred so, small pieces being dipped 
in tomato sauce, chutney, or solution of extract of meat. Sweet- 
bread, kidneys, liver, oysters, and snails are particularly good for 
tuberculous people. Eggs can be eaten raw, or prepared in any 
way known to the cook — poached, boiled, fried, buttered, scrambled, 
omelette, custards, puddings, cakes, and soups. Milk is a valuable 
source of protein: 2 to 4 pints should be taken daily- — e.g., | pint 
drunk warm on waking assists the expectoration of phlegm; 
^ pint with one or two raw eggs in it should be taken at 11 a.m. 
and 4 p.m. ; and another ^ pint at bedtime. The remainder can 
be taken in man}^ kinds of food. When unable to take enough 
meat, the milk should be fortified by the addition of dried milk 
(Ti-uemilk, Cow and Gate brands) or casein (Plasmon, Protene, etc.). 
Meat powders^(e.g., meat ox) may be taken in soup. Pemmican 
and other concentrated preparations of meat can be used. Other 
sources of protein are cheese, lentils, peas, beans, and nuts. 

Fat is an important element in the diet. But many people 
cannot take fat meat, bacon, ham, or butter. The gastric catarrh 
which is responsible for this inability ought to be treated. More- 
over, the cook may be able to devise many articles containing 
butter and fat. Butter can be used to a great extent in cooking, 
but it must be free from rancidity and excess of volatile acids. 
If economical reasons prevent its use, it may be replaced by vege- 
table butter, such as peanolia, palmine, vegaline, albine, etc. 
When the patient can take plenty of fat, it may be eaten as butter, 
cream, cream cheese, fat meat, lard, fat bacon, shredded suet in 
puddings or boiled milk, fish roe, caviar, cod-liver oil, salad-oil. 
Many patients can eat quite a lot of boiled fat bacon when it is 
taken as a sandwich. Pancreatic emulsions of oil can be given to 
aid digestion. Petroleum-oil is not a food, and should never be 
given as such. 

Two facts require pointing out: When the patient cannot take 
fat, the proteins can be increased; 100 grammes of protein will yield 



SUPERALIMENTATION 533 

40 grammes of fat. Proteins alone will never fatten a patient; 
6^ pounds of lean meat or 51^ pounds of lean and fat meat would 
be required to supply the daily requirement of carbon for an 
ordinary person; therefore some other source of carbon must be 
found. 

Carbohydrates are an important source of carbon. The most 
concentrated are sugars (saccharose— loaf-sugar — glucose, lactose, 
and maltose), treacle, honey, dextrin, and pure starch. Some are 
less sweet than others, and may be preferred by the patient. Most 
carbohydrates are easily digested, quickly absorbed, and as a rule 
give very little trouble to the alimentary organs. But an excessive 
consumption of sugar may increase an existing catarrh of the 
stomach, or cause alimentary glycosuria. Massolongo and Danio^ 
prescribed from 100 to 500 grammes of sugar daily in foods, 
such as milk, tea, coffee, or a bitter medicine. They observed 
no dyspepsia or glycosuria, but always a steady increase of 
weight. 

But pure sugar or starch is insufficient. The body must have 
mineral salts, especially iron, lime, soda, magnesia, and the phos- 
phates. Therefore the patient should have bread, flour, oatmeal, 
rice, sago, tapioca, fresh vegetables, and fruit. Wholemeal bread 
is better than white, because it contains a larger proportion of 
phosphates, amino-acids, and vitamines. Ordinary brown bread 
should be avoided, because the particles of bran are too irritating 
to the gastric and intestinal mucosa. Finely ground entire wheat- 
meal is better, especially when enriched by germ or maltculm 
(germ-bread and malted bread). The addition of lentil flour, pea 
or bean flour to the bread would increase the protein, phosphates, 
and iron, and give an attractive bloom or golden tint to the loaf. 
Oatmeal occupies a unique position, its influence on metabolism 
being shown by its " heating properties." Milk puddings containing 
eggs are valuable. Creams, such as Bavarian cream, chocolate- 
cream, rice souffle, brown-bread cream, and blanc-mange, are 
valuable sources of nutriment. Soups containing eggs and 
cream are equally useful. Jellies made from gelatin alone have 
about the same value as one made from starch and water. 
A good cook is a valuable assistant to the physician in all these 
cases. 

Superalimentation, or Forced Feeding.— When it is desired to 
fatten animals quickly, they are kept in a confined space, and, 
after eating an ordinary meal, are fed by a forcing machine. A 
similar mode of feeding phthisical patients was adopted by Dcbove. 
He discovered by accident, when treating the vomiting of phthisical 
patients by gastric lavage, not only that it arrested vomiting, but 
that food introduced through an cesophageal tube was retained 
and digested when food consumed in the ordinary way was vomited. 
Extending his observations, he found, when phthisical patients lost 
their appetite or acquired a repugnance to food, he could introduce 

^ Rif. Med., December 21, 1904. 



534 TUBERCULOSIS 

through the oesophageal tube an excess of food, and it was retained 
and digested. On this he founded his system of superaHmentation. 
Under the influence of an excess of food his patients gained weight 
and strength, night sweats disappeared, cough diminished, ex- 
pectoration almost ceased, there was a general improvement, and 
frequently perfect healing of cavities. The use of a stomach-tube 
is unnecessary when patients can consume what we desire them to 
take; but when they cannot take it, forced feeding may be adopted. 
When the stomach-tube is not used, resort may be had to concentra- 
tion of the food. Debove and Dujardin-Beaumetz prescribed from 
3^ to 12 ounces of meat powder daily in soup, milk, or cocoa. 
Dujardin-Beaumetz recommended two tablespoonfuls of meat 
powder, three dessertspoonfuls of rum-punch, and enough hot milk 
to make a creamy fluid. 

Absorption and Metabolism in Tuberculosis. — The digestion is 
usuall}' good when the alimentary canal is free from catarrh, and 
absorption is practically normal in all cases, gy per cent, of protein 
and 98 per cent, of fat being absorbed. The metabolic processes 
are somewhat feeble; the nitrogenous products in the urine are not 
oxidized so well as in health. Levin found the metabolism of nitrogen 
as low as 73-46 per cent., and that of phosphorus only 34-68 per 
cent, of normal. 

Reaction against Superalimentation. — The enormous diets pre- 
scribed by many physicians have been followed by unpleasant 
consequences to the patient. Harm sometimes results from the 
consumption of an excessive quantity of animal food, prolonged 
high feeding, and idleness. Ihe alimentary organs, in course of 
time, rebel against excessive work. The liver, the most forbearing 
organ in the body, suffers from insufficiency and h3?persemia. The 
blood-pressure becomes abnormally high, and the persistent arterial 
hypertension produces the same effects as in another person. Lesser 
evils are failure of appetite, loathing of food, bilious vomiting, and 
diarrhoea. Bardswell says: " The gradual impairment of the 
alimentary S3-stem is associated with dyspnoea out of all proportion 
to the lung disease. . . . The point to realize is that great over- 
feeding is an unnecessar}' hardship for the patient to undergo, and 
may do positive harm." Overfeeding is decidedly better than 
underfeeding (especially the so-called " antiphlogistic treatment " 
of the early Victorian period), and often results in a permanent 
cure. 

Principles governing the Dietary .^ — It is impossible to frame a diet 
applicable to all cases; indeed, every case should be carefully con- 
sidered, and definite principles acted on. Voit's standard diet, 
containing 1-7 grammes of protein per kilo and 40 calories of energy, 
is sufficient to maintain the nitrogen and body-weight in equilibrium 
during the ordinary occupations of mankind. Therefore, 100 
grammes of protein and 2,664 calories are enough for a man weighing 
145 pounds (66 kilos). But tuberculosis is attended by a rapid loss 
of flesh owing to the febrile condition and the breaking down of cells 



DIETETIC PRINCIPLES 535 

damaged by the toxins. Therefore the increased oxidation must 
be met by the consumption and assimilation oi more than the 
customary amount of food. Many physicians generously increase 
all the constituents of the diet. Bardswell and Chapman, who have 
made an extended study of the disease, found that the morbid 
process clears up better and the general health improves more 
rapidly when more protein is consumed. They used diets containing 
2 to 3 grammes of protein per kilo, or 150 to 250 grammes a day. 
Excellent results foUowed the use of 150 grammes of protein, and no 
better clinical or metabolic results were obtained when a larger 
amount was used; on the contrary, an excess of protein did 
harm. 

It might be thought that equally good results would be obtained 
from increasing the protcin-sparers, but this is not the case. It is 
difficult to fix the amount of carbohydrate and fat; a good deal 
depends on the exercise. An average tuberculous patient does well 
when the total energy is increased to 50 or 60 calories per kilo; and 
the best diet is that which will cause an increase of i^ to 2 pounds of 
weight per week. When the patient has attained a few pounds, say 
15 per cent., over his normal weight, the diet should be reduced until 
it is about sufficient to maintain that weight. The bulk of the food 
has to be considered. Meat, and especially fat, is less bulky than 
carbohydrates, and incommodes the patient less than a dynamic 
equivalent of bread, oatmeal, or other vegetable foods. Cod-liver 
oil is an easily digested fat, the unsaturated fatty acids aiding the 
digestion of the oil and other fats. The tubercle bacillus belongs to 
the acid-fast group, and owes this property to a waxy envelope. It 
is believed by Williams and Forsyth that this envelope is dissolved 
by the fatty acids of cod-liver oil, and .the bacillus is thereby 
made a ready prey to the ordinary antibacillary forces of the 
body. 

Alcohol in Tuberculosis. — It was formerly the custom to recom- 
mend large doses of alcohol, ^ pint of whisky or brandy a day, on 
the supposition that it moderated fever, supported strength, 
diminished the waste of the tissues, and promoted absorption of fat. 
It is not now prescribed in large doses, nor to all patients. Alcohol 
is a stimulant, promotes the absorption of fat, and affords heat and 
energy by replacing fat and carbohydrate. But it does not spare 
the tissues or prevent wasting of the muscles. In so far as it encour- 
ages appetite and encourages eating, it is beneficial. On the other 
hand, there is e\idence that large consumers of alcohol are parti- 
cularly liable to tuberculosis, and bearing this in mind the battle 
against tuberculosis should be combined with the struggle against 
inebriety. 

Milk has ever been found beneficial for tuberculosis, and should 
be freely prescribed. The milk-cure may be adopted. 1 he bacteri- 
cidal properties of this fluid are greatest when it is first taken from 
the cow or other animal. ^ Ancient writers urged that it should be 
drunk in the byies or hovels, as they believed the surroundings of 



536 TUBERCULOSIS 

healthy animals are curative. Other writers recommend that the 
milk should be drunk out of a vessel made of the root of Bryonia 
alba. Kephir and koumiss are useful; many patients can take them 
better than ordinary milk. 

The raw-meat and meat -juice cure {zomotherapy) may be use- 
fully employed (p. 213). According to Hericourt, "it is no exag- 
geration to say the raw-meat and meat-juice treatment of phthisis 
yields results not approached by any other means at present avail- 
able. . . . The enzymes and ferments in muscle plasma may 
account for its quasi-specific action in tuberculosis." 

Meat diet, consisting wholl}' of meat, fowl, eggs, oysters, sweet- 
bread, kidneys, milt, liver, etc., has been recommended on the 
assumption that there is an antagonism between the gouty condition 
and tuberculosis. The idea is to encourage the gouty condition 
by giving foods rich in purins, and this has been extended by the 
prescription of urea as a drug. We have elsewhere shown that it 
is impossible to maintain the weight of the body on animal food 
alone, as 6^ pounds of lean meat and 5I pounds of lean and fat 
would be required for this purpose. Therefore, this diet is incorrect 
for tuberculosis. It is far better to give an abundant mixed diet, 
in which animal food is well represented. 

Typical Dietaries for the Tuberculous. — Brompton Hospital has 
from the earliest times prescribed generous meals. The diets are 
as follows: 

Full Diet A. — The standard for men at rest is 3,000 calories, for women 
2,500; for men at work or taking exercise 3,500 to 4,000, and for women 
2,500 to 3,500 calories. 

Breakfast. — Bread, butter, bacon (man 3 ounces, woman 2 ounces), tea, 
coffee, or cocoa. Bacon is alternated with ^ pound of haddock, I pound of 
kipper, or porridge consisting of 2 ounces of oatmeal and i pint of milk. 

Lunch, II o'clock. — Half pint of milk. 

Dinner, 12.30 noon. — Meat, vegetables, and pudding. Meat is weighed 
before it is cooked; the allowance is 11 ounces for a man and 7 ounces for a 
woman; it consists of hot or cold beef, mutton, or pork with sage and onions. 
Potatoes are given every day, and one of the following vegetables: cabbage, 
carrots, turnips; beetroot with hot roast beef, salad with cold beef. Pea- 
soup is given once or twice a w-eek in place of the former. The allowance 
per patient is \ pound of meat, li ounces of peas, 3 ounces of carrots, 3 ounces 
of turnips, and ^ ounce of onion. Irish stew is given once a week, the allow- 
ance per patient consisting of £ pound of meat with bones, 5J ounces of 
potatoes, and 5^ ounces of vegetables (carrots, etc.). One of the following 
puddings is given every day: Plum-pudding, jam roly-poly, suet pudding, 
and treacle; rice, sago, and tapioca, semolina pudding; boiled rice or cornflour 
mould and stewed fruit. 

Tea. — Bread with ^ ounce butter or dripping and 2 ounces of jam. 

Supper. — Half -pint of milk. 

Full Diet B. — In addition to the foregoing, the patient is given an extra 
rasher of bacon for breakfast, an egg for tea, J ounce of butter, and i pint 
of milk. 

Light Diets A. and B. — These are the same as the full diets, only the meat 
is replaced by 8 ounces of chicken, rabbit, tripe, or fish (sole, plaice, whiting, 
or haddock). 

Half Diet (for children under twelve years). — Only half the amount of meat, 
fish, or fowl is given.

Cheap Diets for Poor Persons.- — The cost of animal food is often 
too high for working-class people, especially English foods. It should 
be pointed out that imported foods have the same protein value as 
home-grown produce. Foreign meat, fish, fowl hare, rabbit, butter, 
and eggs, should always be used when an adequate amount of home- 
grown foods cannot be obtained; and when the best cuts cannot be 
obtained, cheaper material must be used. A pound of Australian 
beef can be purchased for threepence halfpenny, and, with bread 
and vegetables, would provide a dinner for two men at threepence 
each. Australian mutton at fourpence halfpenny a pound and two 
vegetables would provide a dinner for two men at fourpence each. 
Australian hare at threepence a pound, with the usual accompani- 
ments, would provide dinner at fourpence per head. Irish stew, made 
from cheap cuts of meat, and the usual vegetables, can be made to 
provide a dinner at twopence per head. With such foods a person 
can live on fourpence to sixpence per day. Poor people do not suffi- 



HEMOPTYSIS 539 

ciently appreciate the legumes. These vegetables are valuable 
sources of protein; they are not so easily or well digested as meat; 
but the}- should be used whenever meat cannot be obtained in 
sufficient quantity. A comparison of experiments in digestion show 
that a pound of peas or beans yields as much digestible protein as 
a pound of meat. Peanuts are a valuable source of protein, and 
should be consumed more freely than they are usualty. 

Dietaries for Special Crises— HcBnioplysis. — In slight cases no 
alteration of the food is required. But when there is severe bleeding, 
the diet must be temporarily reduced to a very small quantity. 
On the first day cold milk only should be given, a mouthful at a 
time, out of a feeding-cup; in this way 20 to 30 ounces will be taken 
in a day. The milk may be iced; small pieces of ice may be given 
to suck; and the mouth should be washed out occasionally to check 
thirst. On the second day, the diet should be about the same, 
adding onh' two teaspoonfuls of meat-juice every three hours. 
Third day: The milk may be given lukewarm, about five ounces 
every three hours; total 30 ounces. A raw egg may be given in 
i pint of milk, divided into two meals. Cold toast, buttered well, 
4 ounces; and scraped raw or underdone meat, in sandwiches, 4 
ounces, will make a sufficient dietary. From this day there should 
be a gradual return to the former diet, the patient being fed every 
two hours wath milk, raw eggs, raw-meat sandwiches, cold buttered 
toast; Benger's, Allenbury's, or Savory and Moore's food; jelly; 
pounded chicken, light fish (sole or plaice), custard, junket, sago or 
tapioca pudding, etc. The ordinary diet should be resumed in a week. 

Laryngeal Tuberculosis. — Dysphagia often prevents the patient 
from taking an adequate amount of food. Everything should be 
gi^'en warm, neither hot nor cold. Condiments like pepper and 
mustard cause irritation. Sometimes soft foods are swallowed better 
than liquids. 1 he food should then consist of custard, junket, jelly, 
scraped meat, chicken panada, pounded fish, scrambled eggs, blanc- 
mange, Benger's or Savory and Moore's food, jelly, boiled bread 
and milk, sago or tapioca pudding, milk solidified with gelatin or 
isinglass, etc. When liquids only can be swallowed, the patient 
may find it easier to draw them through a tube while lying on the 
side or in a prone position, the vessel being placed lower than the 
licad. In this way he may take milk, milk and raw eggs, milk and 
casein or fortified by dried milk, thin arrowroot, Benger's, Mcllin's, 
Savory and Moore's foods, Hygiama, Ovaltine, extract of meat, 
rich soups (containing eggs and cream), meat-juice, somatose, meat 
powders, soup thickened with lentil flour, potato soup, boiled bread 
beaten with a fork and taken in milk, etc. It should be quite easy 
to provide 160 to 190 grammes of protein, 200 grammes of fat, and 
250 to 300 grammes of carbohydrate. Four pints of milk yield 
1,600 calories; three raw' eggs, somatose, arrowroot, and invalid's 
foods would make up the dietary. 

Vofniting and Dyspepsia in Tuberculous Patients. — Vomiting after 
food is sometimes very troublesome, and it is usually due to cough- 



540 TUBERCULOSIS 

ing. It is better to have a cupful of beef tea or hot milk to encourage 
expectoration before the meal, and the vomiting will cease. Some- 
times the patient suffers so much from dyspepsia that the large 
meals prescribed for ordinary cases have to be stopped for a short 
time. We may then give a diet in which meat or milk form the 
main items: 

6.30 a.m. — Half-pint of milk, Ovaltine or Hygiama food . 

Breakfast, 8 a.m.— Steak, fish, bacon and eggs, toast (dry) with butter; 
I pint of milk-tea, milk-coffee, or peptonized milk. 

II a.m. — Leube's soluble meat, raw-meat soup, meat powder in soup, or 
raw eggs and milk. 

Dinner, i p.m. — Light fish, minced meat, grilled steak or chop, dry toast; 
custard jelly, light pudding, and stewed fruit. 

Tea, 5 p.m. — -Cold toast and butter, biscuit, milk-tea or milk-coffee. 

Supper. — Same as dinner. 

Bedtime. — -Milk or a glass of good wine. 

In severe cases, the diet should consist largely of milk, given every 
two hours; it may be fortified by the addition of cream, dried milk, 
Plasmon or Sanatogen; and alternated with raw egg and milk, raw 
meat in soup, scraped meat sandwiches, custard, junket, milk-jelly, 
invalid's food — e.g., Benger's arrowroot and milk, peptonized milk. 

Tubercular Peritonitis and Intestinal Tuberculosis. — The diet should 
be of the same character as in other cases of tuberculosis, care being 
taken to avoid irritation of the mucous membrane and distension 
by flatus. Meat, rabbit, fowl, or fish, should be scraped, minced, or 
pounded. Some raw scraped meat may be given. Eggs should be 
given raw, poached, lightly boiled, or scrambled; in custard, omelette, 
or souffle. Milk is valuable when there are no ill-effects from its 
use; if it causes constipation, it must be combined with a farinaceous 
food — e.g., Ridge's, Xeave's, Savory and Moore's, or Benger's. If it 
causes diarrhoea, milk should be pancreatized or thickened with 
arrowroot and flavoured with cinnamon or nutmeg. Casein prep- 
arations often cause diairhcea, and should be carefully watched. 
Milk puddings containing eggs are useful, and leave very little 
residue to irritate the bowels. Macaroni is useful, and may be 
fla\-oured with grated cheese. Raw meat can be given in soup or 
sandwiches. Stale bread, dry toast, and biscuits may be given ; but 
the food should not contain too much starch or sugar, lest we cause 
fermentation and flatulent distension. Tea, coffee, and pancrea- 
tized cocoa are useful stimulants and flavouring agents. The 
following diet-sheet may serve as an example : 

6 a.m. — Milk 4 ounces with Bovril, or Brand's essence, Wyeth's beef juice, 
etc. 

8 a.m. — Two eggs, poached, boiled or scrambled ; a rasher of fat bacon ; toast, 
white bread or roll, 2 ounces; butter; tea or coffee with | pint of milk. 

II a.m. — Soup 5 ounces mixed with 14 ounces of scraped raw meat; or 
raw-meat juice i| ounces, with port wine i| ounces, and sponge-cake or 
biscuits. 

I p.jn. — Minced or pounded cooked chicken, fish or tongue, or underdone 
beef or mutton, 4 ounces; potato puree with cream or butter, two table- 
spoonfuls ; dry toast or rusk i ounce ; milk pudding, custard, or junket, a 



TUBERCULAR PERITONITIS 541 

good helping, with i ounce of cream or savoury custard, or macaroni and 
cheese; glass of milk to drink. 

3 p.m. — Kaw-meat juice, ij ounces; port wine, i^ ounces; or Lcubc's 
soluble meat. 

5 p.m. — A poached egg, bread-and-butter 2 ounces, and tea mzule of milk; 
or i pint of Bcngcr's or Allcnhury's food. 

7.30 p.m. — Fish or underdone meat, chicken or tripe, 4 ounces; -potato 
puree with cream or butter; milk pudding, custard, jelly, etc. 

10 p.m. — Benger's, Allenbury's, or Savory and Moore's food, \ pint. 

It should be observed that ordinary soup and beef-tea are liable to 
cause diarrhoea, but they do not always have that effect when 
thickened with flour, and the}' may be the vehicle for giving meat 
powder or somatose. Potatoes are laxative sometimes, and must 
then be forbidden, their place being occupied by dry toast or rusk. 
Oatmeal, turnips, carrots, cabbage, etc., should be forbidden. 

Tuberculosis of the Kidneys or Bladder. — ^The dietary should be 
much the same as for tubercular peritonitis. But it is necessary to 
watch the effect of proteins by frequently examining the urine for 
albumin and pus. So long as the above diet does not increase 
albumin or pus, it should be continued; but if it is found to do so, we 
must confine the patient to milk, bread and milk, milk puddings, 
invalid foods, tea, coffee, and once a day an tgg, fish, chicken, or 
meat (pounded, scraped, souffle, or rissole), with potato and a 
light vegetable. Bread-and-butter may be allowed; also oatmeal, 
and casein preparations. 



CHAPTER XXI 

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

Neurasthenia. — Tlie causes of neurasthenia were divided by 
Savill into (i) toxaemia, (2) malnutrition, (3) fatigue, (4) shock and 
trauma. The most popular theory of to-day is that neurasthenia 
is due to alimentary toxaemia — absorption from the alimentary 
canal of toxins which gradually pervade the organism, including the 
nervous sj'stem; a subsidiary theory is that by an unexplained 
selection the toxins primarily affect the neurons. The toxaemia may 
be due to protein decomposition, impaired metabolism, errors in 
diet — e.g., the ingestion of too much protein, fat, sugar, alcohol, tea, 
tobacco — atonic dyspepsia, hj-perchlorhj^dria, constipation, chronic 
appendicitis, mucous colitis, gastroptosis, enteroptosis, coloptosis, 
etc. Oversvork is an undoubted cause of neurasthenia; and there 
are two chief theories of the cause of fatigue — viz. (i) auto-intoxi- 
cation b}^ the waste products of the cells, and (2) exhaustion from 
excess of work. Shock or trauma may suddenly cause neurasthenia. 

Treatment.- — In traumatic cases a " rest cure " of six or eight 
weeks' duration is the best treatment, especially when the chief 
features are headache, loss of memory, nervousness, tremors, 
palpitation, tachycardia, mental depression, etc. The rest in bed 
should be absolute for the first two weeks, and ought to be com- 
bined with isolation from friends, exclusion of visitors, letters, news- 
papers, etc. Overfeeding and massage should be resorted to. In 
fatigue, or cases of nervous breakdown, a " rest cure " is again the 
ob\aous course to follow. It is, however, often difficult to persuade 
patients of its necessity until the breakdown is complete. After 
two weeks in bed and milk diet, the patient should be ordered a 
course of good feeding, followed by change of air, scenery, and com- 
pany, and prolonged rest from employment. When neurasthenia 
follows infectious diseases — influenza, etc. — the nutrition of the 
patient will be much improved by enforced rest, extra food, and 
freedom from strain. When typhoid fever affects neurasthenics, 
a marked improvement in their condition follows the prolonged 
care, nursing, and dieting; this improvement is partly due to the 
alterative effect of the disease, the increased metabolism, and sub- 
sequent rebuilding of the tissues; the trophic power of the nervous 
sj'Stem is on a higher level after convalescence than before the fever. 

In neurasthenia due to toxcetnia the most obvious symptom is 
chronic fatigue. Herter found indicanuria in 65 per cent, of his 

542 



NEURASTHENIA 543 

cases of neurasthenia. The treatment sliould be started by full 
milk diet, combined with the rest cure, to promote the elimination 
of toxins. The amount should be 4 pints of milk a day, beginning 
with 3 ounces every two hours, and gradually increasing tlie dose 
until 10 ounces are taken every three hours. Milk is valuable as an 
eliminator of toxins, for its scanty residue, and ease of digestion. It 
may be disagreeable to some patients, but it usually becomes 
acceptable when hunger arises and no other food can be obtained. 
Therefore, milk diet should be absolute for ten days. After this period 
we ma>' cautiously add other foods — s.g., a boiled or poached egg 
with bread-and-butter for breakfast, and some fish for the midda}' 
meal. As the amount of solid iood is increased, the milk may be 
decreased, taking care that the dynamic value of the diet is not 
lessened. On the contrary, the diet should be raised in value until 
the patient is overfed. 
The following is a sample dietary: 

First Breakfast, 7.30 a.m. — A breakfast-cupful of hot milk. 

Second Breakfast, 8.30 a.m. — Two eggs, boiled or poached, bread or dry 
toast, and butter; China tea made with {r pint of milk. 

Lunch, ir a.m. — Three or four oysters with wholemeal bread-and-butter, 
or raw-meat sandwiches; a tumblerful of milk. 

Midday Meal. — Six ounces or more of lish, fowl, tender beef, or mutton; 
potatoes, light green vegetables; custard, junket, egg-snow, cornflour mould, 
stewed fruit, or fresh fruit. 

5 p.m. — -China tea made with milk; oysters or raw-meat sandwiches. 

Evening Meal, y to S ^.m.— Tripe with boiled onions; fish, fowl, rabbit or 
tongue with bread-and-butter; fresh fruit; milk and cocoa. 

Bedtime. — A tumblerful of milk. 

Oatmeal. — Decalcification is common in neurasthenia; the urine 
frequently contains an excess of calcium carbonate and phosphate 
Meat and oatmeal are decalcifying agents, and it would seem a priori 
that these foods should be excluded. But it would not do to deprive 
the patient of the stimulating properties of meat, except during the 
preliminary period of absolute milk diet. Oatmeal mav be ex- 
cluded for a time if the patient is not progressing favourably. In 
every case a large amount of milk ought to be taken, and it is 
probable that some of the benefit derived from this food is due to its 
richness in lime and lipoids. 

The nitrogenous metabolism is sluggish in this disease; therefore 
a stimulating diet is essential. The consumption of a large amount 
of protein will accelerate the metabolism. Although they have the 
same dynamical value, a pound of protein causes greater chemical 
changes in the body than a pound of carbohydrates. But they do 
not contain an equal amount of carbon, and therefore '' mixed 
diet " is essential. When- the muscles are wasted, a properly 
balanced diet, containing a small excess of protein (say 2 grammes 
of protein per kilo), combined with rest and massage, is sufficient 
to rebuild the muscular tissues, and promote the recovery of the 
nervous system. The effect of certain bodies in food, called vita- 
mines, is not yet clearly known, but there is no doubt that whole- 



544 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

meal bread, germ bread, and bread containing malt-culms, are more 
stimulating than ordinary white bread, and promote greater 
cellular activity. Lecithin is an important element of nerve tissues. 
But we cannot always rely upon beneficial results following the use 
of lecithin-containing foods. It would seem that the yolk of eggs, 
the brains of sheep and pigs, and similar foods ought to be extremely 
valuable. And so they are in many cases. But lecithin is some- 
times decomposed in the bowels, and causes toxic symptoms. If 
it is known, therefore, that these foods disagree with the patients, 
their use should be forbidden. There is evidence, however, that 
the inorganic phosphorus of the food is almost incapable of being 
assimilated by the nerve cells; but lecithin and its compounds bring 
to the nerve cells highh^ phosphorized organic substances, ready to 
be built into the complex molecules of nuclein. Maize probabl}' con- 
tains more lecithin than any other vegetable food, and may be taken 
as hominy or porridge. Milk also contains lecithin. The lecithins 
are either absorbed unchanged, or decomposed in the bowels into 
cholin, neurin, and glycerophosphoric acid, and res3'nthetized into 
lecithin by the absorbing cells; neither lecithin nor glycerophos- 
phoric acid have been found in the urine or faeces. Respecting 
cholesterin, another constituent of nerve tissues, we do not know 
exactly what role it plays in metabolism (see Vitamines). It is one 
of the substances which are essential to the well-being of the 
organism, being present in all living cells, and therefore those foods 
containing it should be prescribed for the neurasthenic. Especial 
mention should be made of carrots; peas, and beans, which may be 
given in alternation. Carrot soup is valuable for such persons. 

All vegetables are beneficial to neurasthenics if they do not over- 
tax the alimentar}- organ. But a few vegetables are said to be 
particularl}' valuable to them — e.g., onions, garlic, shalots, chives, 
leeks, watercress, mustard and cress, horseradish, and spinach. 
These foods are stimulating primarily to the digestive organs, and 
secondarily to the nervous system. The}- should be forbidden to 
patients having erotic tendencies. The latter remark also applies 
to celery and asparagus, which are useful in ordinary cases. Cloves, 
nutmeg, carawa}-, and cinnamon ma3' be used as spices in the prep- 
aration of food; they have a stimulant effect, and prevent or 
remove nervous depression and lowness of spirits. 

The excessive use of tea, coffee, and cocoa ought to be prohibited. 
China tea may be allowed, but milk should form the principal 
beverage. 

The Weir Mitchell treatment was designed for serious cases of 
neurasthenia and hysteria. The following are the essential items: 
(i) The patient is put into a nursing-home; (2) the nurse should be 
a stranger to the patient, 3'oung, cheerful, and reliable; (3) isolation 
is strictly carried out for six or eight weeks — no visitors, no letters 
to be sent or received, no newspapers; (4) rest in bed must be abso- 
lute; (5) diet, the patient is dieted as detailed above: milk every 
three hours for five or six days; sixth da}-, a chop or steak at midday;

seventh to tenth days, eggs and bread-and-butter for breakfast; 
from this time, three full meals daily, besides 3 or 4 pints of milk, 
and 2 to 4 ounces of extract of malt; (6) massage to be commenced 
on the third day of rest, and carried out systematically until the 
end of the treatment; {7) electricity, interrupted faradic current, 
may be applied to the motor points all over the body for thirty to 
forty-five minutes daily. 

The Weir Mitchell and other overfeeding cures are valuable for 
neurasthenia; but in the majority of cases there is a great accumu- 
lation of fat in the body during the treatment, and this is rapidly 
lost when the patient returns to ordinary diet and exercise. This is 
not as it should be. Fat is wanted in the body, but not an excess 
of it. There is, at the present time, a revulsion against overfeeding. 
Those who have revolted, however, consider high and generous 
feeding is essential ; but they watch the weight and counteract the 
evils of overfeeding by extra massage. Some physicians have gone 
to the opposite extreme. Noel Paton says: " A neurasthenic does 
not require to be fed like a navvy; in most cases 60 grammes of 
protein daily is enough, and this would be supplied in a quarter- 
pound of beef or mutton, and the usual allowance of bread and vege- 
tables." It is, however, an undoubted fact that most neurasthenics 
are undernourished and have been underfed; and therefore, until 
the nutrition of the body becomes normal, the food should be some- 
thing more than normal. There are some cases which do not require 
absolute rest in bed; the nerves are thoroughly tired out and need 
rest, but this can be got without isolation and lying in bed: a holiday 
of sufficient length may be all that, is necessary if the food is properly 
arranged and combined with rest of body and mind. An over- 
worked man may find rest in a long sea voyage, or fishing on the sea 
while staying at the coast, and the mind may get rest by a change of 
company combined with walking, golfing, etc. 

Hysteria. — The nutrition of the nervous system is deranged in 
consequence of a failure in the supply or metabolism of food, especi- 
ally arising from chlorosis, gastro-intestinal disorders, and diseases 
of the sexual organs. When there is any evidence of disease of the 
uterus or other generative organs or passages, they must be treated 
secundem artem. But there is no guarantee that the cure of an 
erosion of the cervix, flexion of the uterus, or disease of any other 
organ which has been the primary cause of the disorder, will be 
followed by a cure of hysteria. It is a psychical disorder. The 
cure of a physical ailment may so impress the patient that the mind 
will recover its tone. But the cure of hysteria rests very much with 
the patient; when she makes up her mind to get well, she will get 
well ; but until this exercise of the patient's will is brought about, v-ery 
little real good can be done. It should not, however, be thought we 
are without resource. Much can be done even for unwilling patients. 
The treatment most successful consists in the employment of 
remedies which influence the nutrition of the system. The greatest 
benefit accrues to patients whose hysteria depends on chlorosis,

546 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

atonic dyspepsia, constipation, and other disorders of the alimentar}' 
and metabohc functions by tlie means detailed under those headings. 
In very severe cases \\'eir Mitchell treatment is bj' far the better 
method. When isolation cannot be carried out, the patient should 
be overfed, the diet consisting of milk, meat, poultry, eggs, bread- 
and-butter, puddings, jellies, custards, creams, fresh vegetables, and 
fruit. Fish should be excluded from the diet if the patient has erotic 
tendencies. Tea, coffee, and cocoa should be reduced to a mini- 
mum; alcohol should be totall}^ excluded. Moral and disciplinary 
treatment is required in many cases. Above all, they should be 
encouraged to work, and especiallj- to work for others; philanthropic 
work, helping others out of their troubles, materially helps to cure 
many hysterical patients. 

Hypochondria, Melancholia, and Other Mental Diseases. — The 
treatment, as far as we are concerned, consists in looking after the 
general health, the condition of the body, and its nutrition. An exami- 
nation of the tongiie, and the alimentary and eliminatory functions 
will give a clue to the diet which ought to be prescribed. Get these 
organs into a proper condition, and then feed up the patient. A 
good cook is as important as a good doctor. As regards the kind 
and amount of food, we must be guided entirel}- by the condition 
of the stomach, the power of digestion, and assimilation. In acute 
cases there is nothing better than milk or egg-flip — hot milk with 
raw eggs and sugar. A pint of milk, with two raw eggs and i ounce 
of sugar, will contain 36 grammes of protein and 675 calories; this 
quantit}' can be given three times a day. If the patient canriot or 
will not swallow it, forcible feeding must be resorted to. An 
oesophageal tube may be used, but nasal feeding is more easily 
performed; it is done by passing a long rubber tube or No. 12 to 14 
rubber catheter through one nostril into the pharynx or oesophagus ; 
the other end is attached to a funnel, and the liquid food slowly 
poured through it. If this method of feeding has to be kept up very 
long, the diet must be varied ; besides egg-flip, the following may be 
given: strong soup, vegetable soup, sausage meat made into an 
emulsion with milk or water and strained through a coarse sieve; 
meat powder (meat ox, Mosquera's beef meal) ; peptonized gruel ; milk 
powder (Cow and Gate brand) ; casein preparations, arrowroot and 
milk, isinglass and milk, liquefied jelly, glucose, wine, fruit juice, etc. 

When the patient is able and willing to take food in the ordinary 
manner, our task is comparatively easy. But the food must be 
nicely cooked, well prepared, pleasant to the eye; tempting to the 
palate, and daintily served. The patient must be overfed: three 
principal meals daily, with intermediate smaU meals — e.g., a glass 
of milk, egg-flip, some Sanatogen or Plasmon, a raw-meat sandwich, 
three or four oysters, etc. The diet given for neurasthenia is applic- 
able. Weir Mitchell treatment is beneficial. But it requires the 
careful exercise of judgment to determine whether lying in bed is 
more likely to be beneficial than exercise in the open air. Moderate 
exercise in the open air is essential at some period of nearly every 



EPILEPSY 547 

mental case, but it may be begun too soon or pushed to excess. 
Massage is a good substitute for exercise in some cases, in others it 
is a very poor one. Rest and exercise are not antagonistic; tliey 
are complementar}'. each bringing the right thing at different stages 
of the same case. 

Epilepsy. — The alimentary organs must receive the closest atten- 
tion. The teeth must be examined, carious teeth stopped, or 
removed, and vacancies filled by artificial teeth. This simple 
procedure alone in many cases has reduced the frequency of the 
fits by improving mastication and digestion. In like manner due 
attention must be given to the stomach, liver, and bowels, for, when 
the teeth are good, a reduction in the number or frequency of fits is 
produced thereby; and, on the contrary, indigestion, constipation, 
and hepatic insufficiency will increase the frequency of the attacks. 

Various dietaries may be adopted: (i) Ordinary mixed diet, 
{2) vegetarian or lacto-vegetarian, (3) purin-free, (4) and salt-free 
diet. 

1. Ordinary Mixed Diet. — All those articles forbidden in gastric 
and hepatic disorders [q.v.) are equally unsuitable for epileptic 
persons. A sufficiency of food must be allowed, but it ought not to 
exceed his normal requirements. A close watch ought to be kept 
over the amount of meat and other animal foods consumed. ]\Iost 
epileptics are big eaters, and often bolt their food. They should be 
persuaded to eat slowly and to masticate their food carefully. They 
should have four meals a day^ — breakfast at 8 a.m., dinner 12.30 
noon, tea 4.30 p.m. (a very light meal), and supper at 8 p.m. (also a 
light meal). Butcher's meat and poultry must only be allowed at 
the midday meal; fat bacon, fish, or an egg, maybe taken for break- 
fast, and occasionally for supper. Eating between meals, especially 
taking chocolates, candy, and other confections, should be forbidden. 
At the Chalfont Epileptic Colony the meals are as follows: 

Breakfast. — Oatmeal porridge with new milk and sugar; bread-and-butter, 
and tea. 

Dinner. — Mutton or beef (roast, boiled, or minced); fish on Friday; potato, 
cabbage, or other vegetable; jam-roll or suet pudding and cooked fruit, 
alternately with milk puddings (rice, sago, or tapioca). 

Tea. — Tea, bread-and-butter, sometimes treacle or cake. 

Supper. — ^lilk pudding, bread and milk, or thick soup alternately. 

At Bielefield and Craig Epileptic Colonies the food is similar. Many 
patients arrive at these institutions in poor health. The object of 
treatment is to build them up b}^ the adoption of broad general 
principles. Of course, special feeding is required in some cases. 
When the patient is very feeble he is put into hospital and given a 
ver}' light nourishing diet, consisting mainly of milk and milk foods. 
If he arrives in moderate health, he is put on diet such as that of 
Chalfont. He is not allowed to overfeed himself, although he is 
permitted tobacco, tea, and coffee (well prepared) in moderation. 

2. Vegetarian or Lacto-V egefarian Diet. — Most epileptics are very 
fond of animal food, and, in some cases, the frequency and violence 
of the fits bear a proportion to the amount of meat consumed. An 



348 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

excess of animal food is admitted on all hands to be injurious, but 
there are some physicians who find a \'egetarian or lacto- vegetarian 
diet is curative; that under its influence the fits cease, and remain 
absent so long as the patient avoids eating meat, fish, poultry, and 
eggs. It is also found that when vegetarian diet is consumed, a 
smaller dose of bromide is sufficient to restrain the attacks. My own 
experience is that lacto-vegetarian diet is far better than a purely 
vegetarian diet, and I am strongly of opinion that the frequency of 
the attacks gradually diminishes until they vanish. A purely 
vegetarian diet is not suitable for epilepsy. The malnutrition and 
depression of epileptics is due to gastro-intestinal indigestion, which 
might be aggravated by a purely vegetarian diet, but would be 
improved by a combination of vegetables, milk, and eggs. 

3. Purin-frec Diet.- — It was shown by Krainsky ^ that there is a close 
connection between the excretion of urea and the occurrence of fits. 
So long as the excretion of urea averages 06 to 08 gramme per fluid 
ounce of urine, there is no danger of a seizure; but each attack is 
preceded by a diminution of the urea, and when it falls to 0-45 or 035 
gramme per ounce a seizure is imminent. An injection of carbamate 
of ammonia produces exacth' similar seizures, whence Krainsky con- 
cluded that epileptic seizures are due to a failure in the transforma- 
tion of nitrogenous substances to urea, and reduced the allowance of 
proteins. Haig^ believes the fits are due to the accumulation of uric 
acid or purin bodies owing to a failure of the organism to transform 
these substances to urea, and prescribes purin-free diet. Aldren 
Turner^ finds in confirmed epilepsy that the combination of purin- 
free, salt-free, and vegetarian diets is very beneficial, and he pre- 
scribes the following: 

Milk (fresh or sour), buttermilk, whey, cheese. Eggs, raw, boiled, or 
scrambled. White bread, macaroni, vermicelli, semolina, rice, sago, and tapioca. 
Suet puddings with jam or treacle, apple dumplings, pastries, pancakes, tea- 
cakes, jellies. Vegetables and fruits of all kinds; weak infusion of tea; water. 

Turner's results from this diet are so good that he recommends it 
for all recent cases of epilepsy, and says: " In all cases in which 
bromide alone has been of little or no use, the purin-free and saltless 
diet has at once led to material improvement. By its aid less 
bromide is required, and if the patient loses weight under its in- 
fluence, the addition of cream or cod-liver oil is usually sufficient. If 
this is not sufficient, it is advisable to permit fish, or even a little lamb 
or mutton." 

4. Salt-free Diet. — The nervous system is rendered more suscep- 
tible to the action of many drugs by depriving the system of sodium 
chloride. A patient on a salt-free diet requires a smaller dose of 
bromide to produce the desired effects, and bromism is less common 
than with an ordinary diet. Hoppe-Seyler says the effective control 
of epilepsy only occurs when one-third of the chlorine of the blood is 
replaced by bromine. Landenheimer found that a proper thera-

3 " The Morrison Lectures on Epilepsy," 1910. 



CHOREA 549 

peutic effect is only obtained when the intake and output of bromide 
salts balance each other. Bromide saturation occurs earlier with 
salt-free diet — viz., in three or four days — while an ordinary diet 
requires three or four weeks to produce the same effect. With 
ordinary diet the patient may take bromide for years without the 
occurrence of toxic symptoms, but with a salt-free diet the satura- 
tion point is lowered, and, if any cause should check the excretion 
of bromide, there may be a sudden development of bromism. 

Beilint and others state that bromism never occurs when the diet is properly 
arranged — e.^., milk ij to 2 J pints, bread 9^ to 12 ounces, butter i;^ to 
i^ ounces, three eggs, tea, coffee, sugar, and sufficient fruit and vegetables 
to bring the food value up to 2,300 or 2,400 calories a day. If all these 
foods are cooked without salt, the diet will only contain 2 grammes, or, roughly 
30 grains, of sodium chloride daily. The bread can be made with yeast and 
salted by mixing sodium bromide with the flour, the proportion being so 
arranged that a loaf for one day contains 45 grains of sodium bromide. Such 
bread is called Bromopan. Other examples of salt-free diet are given in the 
chapter oir Bright's disease. This diet should be given for 5 or 6 weeks at 
a time. Sodium bromide can be used as a condiment like common salt. 

Chorea. — The patient should be kept in bed to insure complete 
physical rest and prevent cardiac complications; mental rest is 
equally essential. The patient should be well fed. Milk, eggs, fish, 
scraped meat, chicken cream or panada, tripe, tongue, oysters, and 
other easily digested protein foods should form the basis of the diet. 
An excess of farinaceous, and especially sweet foods, should be 
avoided. In fact, the diet should be the same as for anaemia or 
hypcrchlorhydria, the patient's age being taken into account. 

A girl of twelve years might have— Milk 2 pints; meat, fowl, or 
tongue 4 ounces; bread or toast 4 ounces; potato 3 ounces; one egg. 
poached, boiled, or in custard; this would contain — protein 60 
grammes, energy 1,320 calories. 

A diet consisting entirely of milk and eggs would not be correct 
for an ansemic child. Moreover, no nervous disease is more likely 
to be fostered by alimentary toxaemia than chorea; the remarks on 
this subject in the article on Neurasthenia are applicable to it. If 
there is a very pronounced toxaemia, as shown by indicanuria, the 
protein content of the food should be lowered for a time. It will 
then be necessary to prescribe a larger quantity of carbohydrate 
and assist its digestion by giving extract of malt, takadiastase, or 
pancreatic powders. Where there is very great irritation of the 
stomach, it may be necessary to suspend gastric feeding and resort 
to rectal feeding for a few days. 

When the gastro-intestinal functions have been re-established, the 
food will require further consideration. The food must be well 
balanced. The reader should consult the tables of requirements on 
pp. 165-167. 

Siegert pointed out that children, between the ages of three and 
ten years, who take too much albumin and fat, and too little carbo- 
hydrate, cellulose, and alkaline salts, develop a distrophy indicated 
by a pale or yellow complexion, loss of appetite, emaciation, con- 



550 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

stipation, and nervousness. Chorea is fostered by such a condition; 
therefore carefully regulate the diet. Some authorities consider 
red meat is too stimulating for a choreic child. But, as a general 
rule, an}' child over three years of age should have meat once a day — 
butcher's meat, fowl, or fish — and it may be scraped, minced, or cut 
into thin strips to assist mastication. Careful mastication must be 
insisted on — it is often overlooked by the mother or nurse. Eggs, 
providing they are fresh, are proper food ; they may be given boiled, 
poached, or in milk pudding or custard. Fruit, vegetables, salads, 
wholemeal bread, and oatmeal, are essential elements of the diet 
if children can masticate and digest them. Siegert objects to cocoa, 
chocolate, and legumes for all nervous children; but the only obvious 
reason is from the point of view of digestion. Tea and coffee ought 
to be withheld. Ihe importance of lime in the food of convulsive 
subjects has been commented on elsewhere; sufficient is contained 
in the milk and other foods. Warm baths, followed by a shower 
bath, or sponging with cold solution of sea-salt, and massage of the 
limbs, are beneficial. Graduated exercises, gymnastics, change of 
air, constant galvanic current to the spine, and moral discipline are 
useful aids to recovery. 

Neuritis, Multiple Neuritis, Sciatica, Neuralgia. — In the majority 
of cases of local neuritis, neuralgia, sciatica, etc., it is sufficient as 
regards diet to prescribe light nourishing food, taking care that 
such food does not upset the digestive and metabolic processes. 
When it is known that indigestion, gastro-intestinal catarrh, 
hepatic hj^peraemia and insufficiency, or other disturbance of 
metabolism exists, the diet must be that of the associated con- 
dition. Alimentary toxaemia must be treated. Gout, rheumatism, 
or diabetes, may be associated with the disease. The abuse of 
alcohol must be forbidden in all cases. An occupation leading to 
mineral poisoning ought to be abandoned. Weakly patients should 
guard against fatigue, overwork, and mental depression. In 
multiple neuritis, alcoholic paralysis, etc., the treatment should be 
started by putting the patient to bed and giving absolute milk diet 
for ten to fourteen days. After this preliminary dietary, the 
organism should be built up by overfeeding — e.g., Weir Mitchell 
treatment — but isolation is unnecessary, except when the mental 
condition demands it. If the appetite is poor, feed with milk, raw 
eggs, custard, creams, farinaceous foods, chicken panada, fish 
cream, light fish, oysters, jellies, soups, milk puddings, etc. In 
alcoholic cases a careful watch must be kept over the visitors, and 
this may necessitate the exclusion of those who surreptitiously 
supply it. The free use of simple liquids, the diuretic action of 
milk, mild purgation, hot baths, and massage are useful for assist- 
ing the elimination of toxins. 

Apoplexy, Hemiplegia, Locomotor Ataxy, and Other Paralyses.— 
A case of apoplexy needs care from the physician and nurse. If 
the period of unconsciousness is short — twenty-four to forty-eight 
hours — no food is required; but care should be taken that the urine 



PARALYSIS 551 

is drawn oil regularly, and tlic colon emptied by croton-oil applied 
to the tongue, or an enema of soapy water. The patient will derive 
comfort if the mouth is sponged occasionally and the tongue 
moistened with glycerine. If the consciousness is of longer dura- 
tion, rectal feeding should be resorted to (pp. 318-325). When the 
patient has recovered consciousness and is able to swallow food, 
he should be given a low diet. On the first day of feeding he should 
have about ij pints of milk in small quantities, diluted with an 
equal amount of barley-water. The second day, 2^ pints of milk, 
and some Benger's food, may be given; sugar should be freely used. 
The third day the food may consist of 2 or 2^ pints of milk, two 
raw eggs, some Benger's or other farinaceous food. From this time 
a light unstimulating diet must be the rule — e.g., milk, bread-and- 
milk, farinaceous foods, custard, junket, jelly, and tliin sago or 
rice pudding. The future dietary should be that detailed under 
Arterio-Sclerosis. 

In hemiplegia, paraplegia, locomotor ataxy, and other paralyses, 
the diet must constantly be light, nutritious, and not very stimu- 
lating. The^amount of proteinshould not exceed 80 grammes 
daily, and in aged persons it may with advantage be reduced to 
Co grammes. '1 he total food should also be rather low, say, 2,000, 
1,800, or even 1,600 calories, according to age and other circum- 
stances. Animal food should be restricted to a small helping of 
meat, rabbit, fowl, or hsh, in the middle of the day. Fat is not 
prohibited by any authority; on the contrary, it is beneficial and 
checks the craving for lean meat. .^Therefore butcher's meat should 
be fat, and cold boiled ham or bacon should be given with fowl 
or rabbit. A small helping of fat bacon or ham may be eaten for 
breakfast. Tripe, tongue, oysters, eggs, vegetable soups, and all 
kinds of soup, fresh vegetables, and fruit may be eaten. Bread- 
and-butter, milk puddings, oatmeal porridge, farinaceous foods, 
and stewed fruits may all be eaten. Rich foods of all kinds should 
be forbidden. All foods forbidden in gastric or intestinal catarrh 
and hepatic hyperaemia should be excluded. Especial care must 
be taken of the alimentary organs. Gastric crises are very liable 
to occm-, particularly in ataxic patients with changes in the joints. 
Fichhorn^ distinguishes tliree varieties of gastric crises besides 
mixed forms — (i) Neuralgic or sensory form without vomiting: 
there is severe pain, increased by light pressure, but often relieved 
by deep pressure over the stomach; (2) hypermotor or spasmodic 
form, distinguished by vomiting and severe pain in the stomach; 
and (3) the secretory form, characterized by vomiting much watery 
fluid having an acid reaction, but containing little HCl. During 
such crises the patient should be treated as if he were suffering 
from^acute gastric catarrh. The return to the previous dietary 
should be very slow. An inquiry into the patient's habits and 
diei may reveal something which accelerates or accentuates the 
crises.

552 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

Headache, Migraine. — Diet is of great value in curing chronic 
headaches and even migraine. But it is exceedingly important 
that the cause of headache or migraine should be diagnosed. 

Harris^ classified them as follows: Superficial headache due to (i) diseases 
of the brain coverings, (a) pain in the scalp from cellulitis, weight of a hat or 
mass of hair, (6) pain in the pericranium from rheumatism or syphilis, {c) pain 
in the bone from caries; (2) reflex visceral neuralgia originating in the con- 
dition of the ej'es, teeth, lungs, heart, stomach, bowels, etc. Deep headache 
due to (i) reflex cortical neuralgia — e.g., visual " academy " headache, 
thunderstorm and neurasthenic headaches; (2) toxasmic headaches arising 
from constipation, sluggish liver, influenza, fevers, alcohol, ether, foul air; 
(3) increased intracranial pressure — e.g., migraine, epilepsy, tight neck-band, 
cerebral oedema due to chlorosis or arterio-sclerosis; hydrocephalus; sinus 
thrombosis; cerebral haemorrhage; acute encephalitis; cerebral abscess or 
tumour. 

The diversity of causes shows how impossible it is to treat all 
headaches alike. Migraine was divided by Liveing into — (i) Simple 
hemicrania, a t3-pical unilateral headache, throbbing with every 
beat of the pulse, and recurring every few weeks; (2) sick headache, 
a periodical unilateral headache, culminating in nausea, vomiting, 
and prostration; (3) blind sickness, the headache being accompanied 
with blurring of the vision, and appearance of luminous zigzags or 
fortification figures. 

There is no doubt that many headaches are due to alimentary 
toxEemia arising from intestinal putrefaction, hepatic insufficiency, 
and other disturbances of the metabolism. As regards the liver, 
Brunton says: " The liver is the porter which stands at the gate 
of the organism to prevent all deleterious substances which enter 
the bloodvessels from the intestines from reaching the general 
circulation. These substances are caught up by the liver and 
destroyed, or excreted unchanged into the intestine, where they 
may pass away with other faeces. But many of these substances 
may be reabsorbed, and so they form a constant round from bowel 
to liver and liver to bowel, until at last they amount to so much 
that the liver cannot deal with them, and they pass into the general 
circulation. A period of time is required for this accumulation, 
which varies even in the same person, and occurs in less time with 
a highly nitrogenous diet. Absorption from the liver is influenced 
by the emotions, so that after emotion a person may become 
jaundiced; therefore we may expect anything which is circulating 
with the bile would be rapidly absorbed. Anxiety, grief, or sorrow, 
is apt to bring on a headache, and there are good reasons for 
attributing the headache to the presence of abnormal constituents 
circulating in the blood. Why do the toxins fasten on the head 
and cause a headache instead of causing a pain in the intestines 
or big toe ? It is because there is some factor, perhaps a local 
lesion, which determines the pain to the head. The most common 
determining causes are decayed teeth, astigmatism, myopia, hyper- 
metropia, presbyopia, nasal or pharyngeal trouble, disease of the 

^ Brit, Med, Jour., 1908, ii. 



HEADACHE 557, 

antrum of Higlimore, or of the frontal or ethmoidal sinuses, glau- 
coma, periostitis, or neuritis." 

The treatment of headaches therefore includes the treatment 
of the cause. This should be carefully diagnosed. As regards diet, 
some patients require feeding up, others require a reduction of flesh, 
and both classes probably require their diet rearranging to suit 
the present conditions. There is no method of feeding which will 
suit all cases, excepting this: the food must be light, nourishing, 
and digestible. All the articles forbidden in gastric, intestinal, 
and hepatic disorders should be forbidden in the treatment of this 
disease. Most cases require plain simple diet of the ordinary kind; 
but some patients need a reduction in the amount of starch and 
sugar; others are decidedly benetited by a lacto-vegetarian and 
purin-free diet, and in other cases the Salisbury diet has proved the 
only satisfactory cure. Haller cured himself of migraine by a light 
diet and a large amount of water. Marmontel likewise cured him- 
self by eating little, drinking much water, and taking plenty of 
exercise. Bilious headache is often the result of an excessive 
consumption of sugar or sweet foods (cakes, puddings) ; the excess 
of carbohydrates, being imperfectly metabolized, set up that con- 
dition called " hypcrpyraemia," or, being transformed to lactic acid, 
irritates the vagus, and sets up bilious attacks with distressing 
migraine. Such cases are benefited by reducing carbohydrates to 
a minimum, or even giving Salisbury diet, until the power of digest- 
ing and metabolizing carbohydrates is recovered. 

On the other hand, migraine is sometimes a consequence of im- 
perfect nitrogenous metabolism. The urine contains an excess of 
purins, ethereal sulphates, or indican. In these cases it is reasonable 
to suppose relief will follow restriction of proteins. But it may be 
that it is an excess of carbohydrates that interferes with the metab- 
olism of proteins. It is absolutely certain the majority of female 
sufferers from migraine do not consume an excess of animal food ; 
indeed, many of them do not eat enough of any kind of food. The 
golden rule in such cases is simplicity of diet combined with careful 
mastication and daily evacuation of the bowels. The idiosyn- 
crasies of the patient should be studied; eggs, fish, fowl, or butcher's 
meat may be each a poison to some migrainous patient. Whatever 
is known to disagree should be excluded. A long course of lacto- 
vegetarian or fruitarian diet, which is practically purin-free, is the 
only remedy for some cases. The dietary which I have found 
beneficial has the following basis: 

Milk, 2 pints; bread, 6 ounces; oatmeal or pearl barley, li ounces; maca- 
roni, i^ ounces; cheese. li ounces; butter, 2 ounces; fat bacon {fried) or 
boiled fat ham [no lean), 2 ounces; shelled nuts, 3.J ounces; fresh fruit and 
vegetables ad libilum ; sugar, honey or treacle, i i ounces. The total protein 
is 100 grammes, the energy 2,800 calories; enough for a working man. 

The milk should not be less than 2 pints a day, and this will 
provide 40 grammes of protein. It may be taken hot or cold, in 
junket or jelly, or macaroni pudding. Being assured that this 



554 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

quantity of milk is consumed, we may be confident that, with 
other foods, the patient will not suffer protein starvation from the 
absence of animal food. Although the patient is not allowed lean 
meat, there is no reason why he should not eat meat-fat, therefore 
fat bacon, fat ham, and suet puddings are good foods. A palatable 
dish ma}- be made of boiled fat bacon, boiled macaroni, tomatoes, 
and grated Parmesan cheese. Nuts have the same protein value 
as meat, but fruit and vegetables must be eaten the same day as 
nuts to prevent constipation. The following combinations are 
suitable: Apples, w-alnuts, and figs; apples, dates, and roasted 
peanuts; apples and raisins with walnuts or peanuts; apples, 
almonds, and bananas; gi^apes or raisins Brazil nuts or filberts; 
oranges, bananas, and filberts, etc. 



CHAPTER XXII 

FEVERS 

The constancy of the temperature of the body is remarkable. 
The temperature of the interior is somewhat higher than that of the 
skin, but the mean is maintained by the circulation of the blood, 
radiation of heat, and evaporation of moisture from the skin. The 
production of heat is increased by muscular action, and diminished 
by rest. Loss of heat is increased by dilatation of the cutaneous 
vessels and increased flow of blood through them; it is diminished 
by contraction of the cutaneous vessels and dilatation of those in 
'the splanchnic area. These variations are normally controlled by 
a thermotoxic mechanism in the cerebral nervous system, and there 
are trophic or nutritional nerves which likewise influence anabolism 
and katabolism, and thereby the production of heat. 

In fever the production of heat is increased lo or 12 per cent. 
The rise of temperature is due to a combination of causes — (i) Dis- 
turbance of the heat-regulating mechanism; (2) increased produc- 
tion; and (3) diminished loss of heat. Increased production of heat 
only causes rise of temperature when the heat-regulating mechanism 
is disturbed. 

The metabohsm is greatly increased during fever. The intake 
of oxygen and output of COg are increased about 20 per cent., owing 
to increased oxidation. With the decline of fever, the intake of 
oxygen and output of CO2 sink to normal, or less than normal, owing 
to reduction of oxidation. The excretion of nitrogen is increased 
20 to 50 per cent, during fever, owing to destruction of the tissues. 

In a healthy body the nitrogen excretion is proportioned thus: Urea 84 
±0 87, ammonia salts 2 to 5, uric acid i to 3, extractives 7 to 10 per cent. 
The urea group (urea, creatin, and ammonia) is derived from protein in general ; 
the purin group (uric acid, xanthin, hypoxanthin, adenin, etc.) from nucleins 
and nucleo-proteins only, in fever, all the nitrogen is increased, but par- 
ticularly the uric acid and ammonia. That this increase arises from the 
destruction of body tissues is shown by the ratio of phosphoric acid to tlie 
nitrogen in the urine. In meat the ratio of P2O5 to N is i : 73; when a body 
is fed on meat the ratio in the urine of ^2^5 to N is i : 7-3 or 6"9. In tissue 
protein the ratio of P2O5 to N is i : 3*9 or 4'i ; during starvation and fever the 
ratio of these bodies in the urine is the same as in tissue protein. 

Feeding the Patient in Febrile Conditions. — The custom of " starv- 
ing a fever " prevailed for centuries. This was changed by Graves 
(1840 to 1850), who " fed fevers " and urged the necessity for a 
rational diet Since that time many observations on metabolism 

SSS 



5S6 FEVERS 

in fever have been made. These observations, speaking generally 
support Graves's contention that fever patients formerly were in- 
sufficiently fed, and the diet ought to be arranged on a physiological 
basis. It was formerly contended that food causes an increase of 
fever, but recent observations disprove that dogma. In 1892 
Puritz experimented on fever patients with (i) low diet, (2) abun- 
dant diet, and (3) diet containing a normal proportion of protein 
and an increased amount of fat and carbohydrate. The abundant 
diets did not cause any increase of fever; they consisted of meat, 
milk, bread, port wine or brandy, and included — protein 180, fat 
60 to 90, and carbohydrate 300, grammes. The low diets consisted 
of broth, milk, bread, wine or brandy, and included — protein 40, fat 
10 to 20, and carbohydrate 100 to 120, grammes. The digestion and 
assimilation during fever were found to be somewhat below normal. 
But when the patients took a large amount of liquids, they digested 
y8 to 82 per cent, of protein, and during convalescence 85'6 to 
90 '5 per cent. Hoesslin, after experimenting on cases of typhoid 
fever, confirmed these statements. He gave the patients milk, 
eggs, soups, porridge made with flour, ham, and other foods, and 
found, when the fever was moderate (100° to 103° F.), and the 
diarrhoea also moderate, the matter of the f?eces was not materially 
increased, and the digestion and assimilation of food did not 
materiall}- differ from that of healthy individuals. Other physicians 
have obtained similar results. In severe cases of fever 75 to 82 per 
cent, of protein, 90 per cent, of fat, and 85 to 90 per cent, of carbo- 
h3'drate is digested and assimilated. 

It is therefore not correct to say it is useless to give a fever 
patient foods because they are not properly digested. The effect 
of fever is to check the secretion of saliva and gastric juice to some 
extent. The mouth is dry and the appetite deficient. The secre- 
tion of gastric juice is diminished, and the hydrochloric acid absent 
or much reduced. The digestion is largely intestinal, and that 
may be defective from the absence of hormones. These are not 
sufficientl}' powerful arguments to combat the results of experiments 
in digestion. It is proper to feed a fever patient in a rational 
manner. It is probable that the reaction against low diet or 
starvation for fever was carried too far, and a too abundant diet 
was given by many physicians. At the present day some physicians 
have reverted to the starvation diet, but the general tendency is to 
give a normal diet of liquid and semisolid foods of a light and 
easily digestible character, with some excess of carbohydrates to 
spare the destruction of tissues. 

A consideration of the metabolism leads to the same conclusions. 
The observations show that a healthy body absolutely at rest 
excretes 7 or 8 grammes of nitrogen daily, and when doing moderate 
work, II or 12 grammes dail}'; but in febrile diseases, such as 
pneumonia, typhoid fever, diphtheria, etc., the excretion of nitrogen 
rises to 18 or 20 grammes a day. Therefore more protein is required 
during fever to protect the cells which are sound, to replace 



DIETETIC PRINCIPLES 557 

cells damaged bv disease or broken down by oxidation, to supply 
amino-acids for consumption by the phagocytes, and for the forma- 
tion of antibodies. Observations have shown that, on a low diet, 
the nitrogen of the urine may be four or five times as much as the 
nitrogen in the food, but with an abundant diet during fever the 
nitrogen in the urine is only 10 or 15 per cent, more than in the 
food. To meet this increased expenditure of nitrogen during 
fever, the food ought to contain i"5 to 20 grammes of protein per 
kilo (075 to I'O gramme per pound) of body-weight, or a total of 
105 to 150 grammes of protein daily. This is the physiological 
demand for protein during fever. 

It is possible tliat notliing will absolutely prevent the waste of 
tissues or emaciation during fever. One of the causes of emaciation 
is the increased combustion or oxidation of carbon. The radiation 
of heat is increased 20 per cent., and this increased heat is derived 
from the destruction of tissues. So far as the supply of carbon tor 
oxidation is concerned, the tissues can be spared considerably by 
giving gelatin, fat, and carbohydrates in the food. According to 
\Vickeand\Vieske,i 100 grammes of starch diminish the katabolism 
of protein 19 to 21 per cent., and 100 grammes of fat diminish it 
30 to 40 per cent. 

These considerations allow that the consumption of protein 
during fever should not be less than normal, and it may, with advan- 
tage to the patient, be slightly increased. As the expenditure of 
energy is increased 20 per cent., the total caloric value of the food 
ought to be proportionably increased. During absolute rest in bed 
a healthy man uses 1,400 to 1,600 calories of energy; during fever 
the expenditure rises to 1,750 or even 2,000 calories. Allowing for 
the diminished power of digestion during fever, the heat value of 
the food for an adult should be not less than 2,000 calories, and the 
protein not less than 100 grammes per diem. Want of appetite is 
no proof of inability to digest food. It has been shown in a person 
with complete anorexia that food, when introduced through an 
(esophageal tube, is digested as well as in a case of fever. Whether 
carbohydrate or fat should be given as a protein-sparer partly 
depends on the patient's liking; fat appears to be more easily 
digested than carbohydrates during fever, but patients frequently 
object to butter, cream, and other fatty foods, and take jelly 
(gelatin), farinaceous foods, and sugars more readily. 

The Importance of giving Carbohydrates in Fever. — Although the 
patient may be allowed a choice of fat or carbohydrates, there are 
reasons why carbohydrates form a most essential part of the fever 
diet. When patients are badly fed, their tissues are destroyed 
rapidlv. But during a high temperature the oxidation of nitrog- 
enous tissues is incomplete, and the fatty substances are not reduced 
to their lowest terms. Indeed, some of the fatty acids do not pass 
beyond the stage of /3-hydroxybutyric acid, diacetic acid, and 
acetone. In consequence of this imperfect oxidization, there arises 

^ Zeil. j. Physiol. Ghent., 1896, xxiii. 265. 



558 



FEVERS 



a condition of acidosis and acetonuria. It is believed that acidosis 
is responsible for the " typhoid state." It has been shown, how- 
ever, that this can be prevented by the administration of carbo- 
hj'drates. Von Noorden watched its effects in cases of typhoid 
fever. A was given a diet containing \ery little carbohydrate, and 
the urine developed a marked reaction of diacetic acid, B had a 
diet containing plenty of carbohydrate, and the urine developed 
only a slight reaction of diacetic acid. The diets were then 
reversed; the urine of A afterwards gave only a slight diacetic acid 
reaction, that of B a marked reaction. Similar results have, been 
obtained in other fevers, and show a judicious use of carbohydrates 
will prevent or cure the " typhoid state." It is not essential thait 
the carbohydrates should consist of starchy foods. The soluble 
foods containing dextrin, malto-dextrin, maltose, lactose, or sac- 
charose, can be used. These carbohydrates are absorbed during 
fever almost as completely as in health. The protein-sparing power 
of disaccharides is about the same as that of polysaccharides (e.g., 
starch and dextrin), but the poh'saccharides take up more energy in 
digestion than monosaccharides (dextrose, levulose, and galactose). 
Moreover, there is another reason for the free use of carbohydrates 
— viz., the influence of diet on the intestinal flora. The character 
of the bacteria can be altered by varying the diet. It has been shown 
that when a fluid contains an excess of proteins, certain bacteria 
produce toxins; but if the fluid contains an excess of sugars, the 
same organisms produce acids. Kendall found most bacteria 
utilize carbohydrate in preference to proteins; that when there is 
plenty of sugar at hand, they do not attack proteins, consequently 
toxins are not produced. It changes the character of the bacteria 
from putrefactive to fermentative. Therefore carbohydrates spare 
the tissues from destruction, afford heat and energy to the body, 
prevent acidosis and toxaemia, and assist in a rapid return to normal 
health and good condition. Taking all these points into considera- 
tion, the following example may be considered a typical fever 
dietary:

THE FEVER DIET 559 

These items would yield about 2,426 calories, and would meet 
the theoretical expenditure of a case of moderate fever. The addi- 
tion of another pint of milk would raise the total to 2,836 calories. 
Such a diet should be aimed at. Some people can easily take it; 
others cannot consume more than enough to supply r,8oo or 
2,000 calories, and some do not digest it very well. There is every 
degree of variation in the appetite and digestive power. We have 
previously shown that appetite is no guide to digestive capacity, 
and that the chief difficulty is to get the food into the digestive 
tract. 

The best sources of protein are milk and eggs. Milk is bland, 
soothing, and gratifying to the thirsty patient. The flavour is not 
objectionable. It is easily digested; its waste products do not 
irritate the excretory organs. It is better to give small doses 
frequently repeated; 5 ounces every two hours would use up 
3 pints of milk a day. If it is vomited, and the curds are large and 
firm, the milk should be boiled; the curds will then be smaller 
and less irritating. Boiled milk has the advantage of being steri- 
lized, and the disadvantage of losing the enzymes and antibodies 
which are present in raw milk. If boiling the milk is not sufficient 
to check vomiting or pain, it must be diluted with barley-water, 
lime-water, or soda-water, which prevent the formation of hard 
curds and relieve irritation. The addition of citrate of soda, i or 
2 grains to an ounce, prevents the formation of curds. Milk can 
also be peptonized, made into junket, jelly, or custard. If the 
patient complains of the mouth being dry, various expedients may 
be tried for its relief — e.^., sucking a thin slice of lemon, sponging 
the tongue with boracic lotion, or painting it with glycerine. If 
the proper quantity of milk cannot be consumed, that which 
is taken must be fortified by the addition of dried milk powder 
{e.g., Cow and Gate brand), casein preparations (Plasmon, 
Protene, Tilia, Sanatogen, etc.). If the flavour of milk is objec- 
tionable, it must be disguised by adding some concentrated 
infusion of tea or coffee, decoction of cocoa-nibs, meat extract, 
strong soup, boiling the milk with the green tops of celery or an 
onion. 

Eggs come next in importance to milk. Two eggs contain 
I3"5 grammes of protein, 11 '6 grammes of fat, and 163 calories^ 
that is, more nutriment than i pint of beef-tea at a quarter the 
cost. They can be given in milk, soup, tea, cocoa, and other fluids, 
or in the form of custard. 

Beef -tea, soup, broth, and other meat infusions were formerly 
relied on to a verv great extent for feeding feverish patients. This 
was an error. Clear beef-tea contains little but meat bases, salts, 
and water. Even when the " grounds " are included, a pint of 
beef-tea contains only the nutriment of i ounce of beef. The salts 
are out of proportion to the nutriment, and the effect of drinking 
such a fluid is increased thirst, sometimes a rise of temperature, 
and the certainty of additional waste nitrogenous matters to be

The superiority of milk and eggs is clearly proved by these 
analyses. The protein content of meat infusions is very small, and 
the calorie value of soups depends on the carbohydrates used for 
thickening them. Soup made from bone and connective tissues — 
e.g., ox-tail — contain sufficient gelatin to make them stiff when they 
are cold; i per cent, of gelatin will do that. As a protein-sparer 
gelatin has about the same value as starch. The value of soups can 
be greatly increased by the addition of eggs, milk, meat powder 
(meatox, beef meal, somatose, peptonoids) , or milk powders. Calves'- 
foot jelly contains 43 per cent, of protein, and 17-4 per cent, of 
carbohydrate, mostly sugar. Jellies made from fruit contain only 
I "5 per cent, of protein, but the carbohydrate may be as much as 
40 or 50 per cent. 

Carbohydrate foods should be used as much as possible. There 
is clear evidence that the patient can digest them. They may 
consist of farinaceous foods, bread-and-milk (the bread should be 
boiled in water, strained, and beaten with a fork before it is mixed 
with milk), oatmeal porridge, arrowroot, or milk pudding. There 
is evidence that root-starch is more quickly digested than cereal 
starch ; hence the recommendation of arrowroot, tous le mois, 
tapioca, sago, and potato starch (British arrowroot) for fever patients 
is a scientific procedure. Many farinaceous foods have their starch 
partly transformed into soluble materials. The starch in rice and 
oatmeal is partly dextrinized during prolonged cooking (four or 
five hours) in a slow^ oven. Dextrinization has been largely carried 
out in the manufacture of many commerical invalid foods. When 
there is clear evidence that the patient cannot digest ordinary 
farinaceous materials, some Benger's, Savory and Moore's, or 



THE FEVER DIET 561 

MeUin's food may be given. Ovaltine, Hygiama, or Havvley's 
Liebig food may be used for a change. Peptonized gruel or 
diastased cereal foods are useful. 

Sugar is one of the most important protein-sparers. It should 
be employed to the extent of 2 ounces or more a day. It is a 
valuable source of energy, cardiac stimulant, and restorative. 
Ordinary cane-sugar can be given in tea, coffee, cocoa, milk, and 
all farinaceous foods. If cane-sugar is considered too sweet, some 
of it may be replaced by lactose, glucose, or extract of malt, which 
have a similar value. Lactose can be added to milk; glucose to 
tea, coffee, porridge, or pudding; extract of malt added to milk 
also changes the flavour and prevents the formation of large 
curds. 

Beverages. — The consumption of a large quantity of fluids is 
beneficial in all febrile conditions. It quenches thirst, raises 
arterial tension, removes waste from the tissues, washes away 
toxins, promotes diuresis and perspiration, increases evaporation 
from the surface, and tends to lower the temperature. Copious 
drinking of hot or cold water in fever improves the assimilation of 
food, and intensifies the metabolism both quantitatively and quali- 
tatively. The patient ought to be encouraged, in reason, to drink 
plenty of water in its various forms. It may be thought that the 
amount of fluids in the typical diet given above is sufficient for 
the needs of the body. Such is not the case. An adult ought to 
drink 4, 5, or even 6 pints of water in addition to those foods. It 
may consist of plain water, soda-water, lemon-water, barley or 
oatmeal water, toast-water, apple-water, black-currant tea, rice- 
water, orange-water, raspberr)- vinegar and water, treacle-posset, 
linseed-tea, sage-tea, imperial drink, whey, tamarind whey, white 
wine whey, cream of tartar whey, lemon whey, and many other 
beverages in which water predominates. Ice in small pieces may 
be allowed when necessary to check nausea or vomiting. 

Tea, coffee, and cocoa are useful beverages. But they are some- 
thing more: they are valuable stimulants and restoratives of a high 
order — preventatives of fatigue, collapse, and cardiac failure. 

Alcohol should be used sparingly, and ought to be reserved for 
a critical period. In former days alcohol was prescribed freely on 
the supposition that it lowered the temperature and was oxidized 
in place of the tissues of the body. It does lower the temperature; 
ordinary doses reduce it 05 to i'o° F., and larger doses from 
5'^ to 6° F. A certain amount of alcohol is oxidized in the body, 
each gramme yielding 71 calories. It never raises the temperature; 
it increases the action of the heart, and causes a chlatation of the 
vessels of the skin, and more heat is lost in this way than the alcohol 
produces. Alcohol can take the place of fat, to some extent, as a 
protein-sparer, but it does not take the place of carbohydrate. 
It has very little effect on the excretion of nitrogen. Some 
authorities assert that it assists the absorption of fat; others find 
it decreases the assimilation of both fat and protein. Dujardin- 

36 



502 FEVERS 

Beaumetz^ says: " Some see in alcohol a force-giving medicine 
which acts in febrile diseases by sustaining and augmenting the 
strength of the patient; others regard alcohol as an antipyretic, 
which lowers the temperature and prevents hyperpyrexia; some 
maintain it hinders organic disintegration, others maintain it acts 
simply as a food." Dujardin-Beaumetz agrees that alcohol has a 
beneficial influence by its threefold action as an antipyretic, food, 
and tonic. As a food, he says, it undergoes more or less complete 
oxidation at the expense of the ox}-gen of the blood; it saves the 
tissues by undergoing oxidation in their stead; the pyrexial pheno- 
mena are thus diminished and the temperature lowered. " It also 
acts on the nerve centres by giving them strength and tonicity, 
and is therefore a force-giver." On the Continent, wine is generally 
prescribed, the amount usually being from 5 to 10 ounces of light 
red \\nie, such as Burgundy or Bordeaux; strong alcoholic wines 
and spirits are reserved for severe cases. There is no objection to 
these wines, nor to port, sherry, or champagne in suitable cases ; but 
in Great Britain an equivalent of brandy or whisky is more com- 
monly prescribed. 

The regular use of alcohol in the treatment of febrile disorders is 
unnecessary. The temperance hospitals have proved that most 
patients do better without it. Owing, therefore, to the tendency to 
form a habit, the excuse that the doctor ordered it as a reason for 
its continued use, and the dire effects of intemperance, it behoves 
us to be cautious about the use of so powerful, valuable, but per- 
nicious article. The body soon becomes inured to it, and an 
ordinary dose then fails to stimulate it. When it is given in the 
earl}- stages of a febrile disorder, the body gets accustomed to it, 
and is unable to obtain from it the beneficial effects required during 
a critical period. It should be reserved for cases of exhaustion in 
wliich the cardiac muscle, damaged by the high temperature or 
toxins, fails to do its work adequately. The indications for it are 
a pulse of 120 or more, a dry, brown tongue, and muttering delirium. 
If reserved to this period, it will strengthen the failing heart, im- 
prove the circulation, clear the brain, enliven the mind, and assist 
in lowering the temperature. But these effects may be followed 
by depression spreading from the higher to the lower nerve centres. 
If the pulse and respiration are quicker after than before it, the 
thirst greater, the tongue browner, and the mind more obscured, 
it is doing more harm than good, and should be replaced by musk, 
ammonia, strychnia, ether, or other drugs. Alcohol is a valuable 
ally, but may become a dangerous enemy. Much depends on the 
former habits, the state of the kidne3's, and the age of the patient. 
The following are the cases in which Hutchison considers alcohol 
to be imperatively necessary: (i) Failing circulation, shown by — 
(a) Persistently rapid pulse (120 or more), weak, irregular, or 
dicrotic; {h) when the first sound of the heart is faint or inaudible. 
(2) Nervous exhaustion, indicated by the " typhoid state," sleep-

DIET FOR VARIOUS FEVERS 563 

lessness, tremors, or delirium, (j) Failure of the digestive power — 
inability to take food, dry tongue, diarrlKea. (4) Persistent high 
temperature. (5) Bad general condition — feeble, exhausted, elderly 
and alcoholic subjects. (6) Specific diseases — malaria, erysipelas, 
septic poisoning, etc. He recommends malt whisky for most cases, 
but genuine cognac is better for the " typhoid state " and nervous 
exhaustion, because it is richer in ethers; old sherry is also rich in 
ethers, and may be used; dry champagne is better in cases attended 
by vomiting, and stout is useful for insomnia. The amount recom- 
mended is I ounce of spirit or i ounce of wine every four, three, or 
two hours, according to necessity. A child should have from 5 to 
20 drops of brandy or whisky every three hours, made into a 
mixture to be taken in i to 2 teaspoonful doses. Champagne may 
be given for vomiting, and port wine or Burgundy in convalescence. 

The Diet in Convalescence. — The general rule is not to allow 
any solid food until after the temperature is normal. But the 
farinaceous foods, milky puddings, junket, custard, and jelly, may 
be allow^ed before the temperature is normal. If they have not 
been previously allowed, they should now constitute the first 
addition to the diet. We can then go on to ordinary milk puddings 
containing eggs — rice, sago, tapioca, vermicelli, semolina, maca- 
roni — cornflour mould and stewed fruit, sponge cake, Madeira cake, 
and puree or consomme of vegetables. Other foods may now be 
added in the following order: Eggs (poached or lightly boiled); 
steamed fish (sole, plaice, whiting, haddock, or cod) and mashed 
potato; raw-meat sandwiches, raw oysters, boiled fowl, chicken, 
or stewed rabbit; and finally tender beef or mutton with hght 
vegetables, .such as cauliflower, spinach, boiled lettuce, vegetable 
marrow (squash), a few tender green peas or kidne}' (string or snap) 
beans. The ordinary diet may now be taken. The amount of solid 
food must be increased slowly, otherwise indigestion or gastric 
catarrh will result. But if the foods be taken in the order given 
above, the stomach will become gradually used to solid food, and 
evil consequences may be avoided. 

Diseases in which the Fever Diet is Applicable. — The diet 
gi\-en above may be prescribed in a large proportion of acute 
diseases, such as those in the list on p. 564. It is not claimed that 
this list is complete. The addition of the words " low," " full," or 
" generous " indicates a corresponding amount of food. In some 
diseases a modification of the food is required, and these will be 
commented on below and in other parts of the book. 

There are some diseases in which a modification of the fever diet 
is necessary. The modes of feeding in a few of the more common 
ailments is as follows: 

Measles.— The general fe\-er diet is applicable to most cases. 
Young children require milk diet only during the acute febrile stage, 
with plenty of water or its variants to drink. If the child vomits 
milk, mix it with lime-water or barley-water. If vomiting is per- 
sistent, give albumin-water alone until the vomiting ceases. When

strengthen the milk by adding a raw beaten egg twice a day; or 
give a tcacupful of broth fortihed by a beaten raw egg-white, and 
some farinaceous food maj^ be given. If diarrhoea occurs, avoid 
the use of broth and beef-tea; give milk and arrowroot, enriched by 
one raw white of egg to a tcacupful. When the rash is gone, the 
food may consist of milk, milk puddings, custard, jelly, bread and 
milk, or bread-and-butter. In convalescence the diet detailed 
under that head should be given in proportion to the age.

Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria.— Milk diet only should be given until 
after the disappearance of the rash. Vomiting is very common

until the rash is well established; hut the patient may be given some 
albumin-water, or equal parts of milk and lime-water, some black- 
currant tea, or other watery fluid. After the subsidence of the 
rash, ordinary fever diet should be given until the temperature is 
normal: bread and milk, well-cooked oatmeal, farinaceous foods, 
egg-custard, junket, baked apple, etc., may now be given if the 
patient can swallow them. If the fever is prolonged, milk, raw 
(i^g, beef-tea, gelatin-water, etc., should predominate in the diet. 
In septic cases there may be persistent vomiting or diarrlKjea. 
\'omiting may be checked by the use of alliumin-water, lime-water 
and milk, Valentine's meat-juice, barley-water and cream, but it 
may need the use of champagne or brandy and soda-water. Occa- 
sionall}' it necessitates resort to rectal feeding. In bad cases the 
stomach may be washed out twice a day with a warm solution 01 
sod. bicarb, and sod. chloride. But a concurrent diarrbea may 
render rectal feeding useless. In such a case the vomiting and 
diarrhoea may be simultaneously relieved by an aperient and 
rectal irrigation. Diarrh(ea occurring alone may be checked by 
arrowroot or cornflour and milk. Brand's essence of beef, albulactin, 
glaxo, glidine, or Plasmon. But in a serious case the colon should 
be washed out, a saline fluid injected into the rectum or areolar 
tissues, and brandy or champagne given freely. When the diar- 
rhoea is over, the milk should be peptonized and some Benger's or 
Mellin's food given for a few days. Sugar may be given freely, 
especially glucose or maltose. Ordinary cane-sugar is excellent to 
prevent cardiac failure. Jelly may be given, but sago or tapioca- 
jelly, with sugar and cream, are better than meat jelly. 

Much difficulty in swallowing may necessitate nasal feeding. 
Adults sometimes swallow thick foods easier than fluids — e.g., bread 
soaked in milk, boiled egg, minced beef, chicken or rabbit, baked 
custard, junket, blanc-mange or jelly. But a slight paralysis of 
the palate may cause young children to regurgitate food through 
the nose. Children should not be allowed to feed themselves when 
this occurs. During the meal they should be placed in the 
Casselbury position — i.e., lying on a nurse's knees with the head a 
little lower than the body. In this position the swallowing is 
easier, and the child can be fed with a spoon. In very severe 
cases nasal feeding must be resorted to, and generally it gives better 
results than rectal feeding. The nasal tube should be insinuated 
carefully through the nostril. Milk, Plasmon, raw egg and milk, 
arrowroot, Mellin's food, peptonized foods, meat juice or extract, 
may be given. If the patient is up, he should be sent back to bed 
as soon as paralysis occurs. 

Cardiac failure may arise from toxaemia or degenerative changes 
in the myocardium. Ordinary stimulants are of little use in such 
a condition, but brandy or champagne may be tried. Ordinary 
cane-sugar, musk, ether, ammonia, and strychnine are useful. 

Albuminuria and Convalescence. — It is considered by some 
authorities that the fever diet should be kept up until all danger 



566 FEVERS 

from nephritis is past. But in the third week of the illness an 
adult Tna.y usually be allowed some white fish, mashed potato, 
boiled ^•egetables, and stewed fruit. Boiled rabbit or fowl may 
be allowed a few dajs later, and from that time the ordinary diet 
may be gradually resumed. 

It is not imcommon for albumin to occur in the urine during 
the course of an}^ febrile disorder; it consists of serum-albumin and 
globulin. Albumoses may also occur ^^■hen very rapid destruction 
of the tissues is taking place. This is due to the general febrile 
condition. But in scarlatina and diphtheria the albuminuria is 
often due to some change in the kidneys, which may be due quite 
as much to toxins as to the high temperature. The diet has no 
influence in causing such albuminuria. In 10,983 cases treated 
with a liberal diet, Craiger found nephritis occurred in 11 '9 per 
cent. ; and in 4,486 cases treated with a restricted diet, Ker found 
nephritis and albuminuria in 11 '2 per cent. Craiger concluded 
that there was no evidence of nephritis being caused by the use of 
liberal diet in the acute stage of scarlet fever. He follows the 
general rules for feeding fever patients, and prescribes milk, raw 
eggs, soup, or beef-tea in the febrile stage. As soon as the tem- 
perature is normal he prescribes custard, junket, milk puddings, soft- 
boiled eggs, bread-and-butter, if they can be swallowed; and two or 
three days later he adds to the list light fish, minced meat, chicken 
cream, and mashed potato. 

A restricted diet is prescribed by Jaccoud, Moizard, and other 
authorities in Europe and America, who insist upon nothing except 
milk being allowed until one week after the temperature is normal. 
Some people keep up the milk diet until four to six weeks after the 
disappearance of the rash. Such restriction is seldom necessary. 
Jaccoud prescribes, a week after the temperature is normal, 2 to 
4 pints of milk, eggs, white meat, and vegetables; fish is not allowed 
so early. If the eggs and milk were partly transformed into 
custard and junket, the diet would not differ materially from 
Craiger's. Forcheimer prescribes a liberal fever diet, but from 
the end of the second week to the end of the fourth week he 
restricts the patient to milk. Carbohydrates are then added, and 
if no bad result occurs, meat next, and then ordinary diet is re- 
sumed. Although diet alone does not cause albuminuria, it is 
reasonable to spare the kidneys at a critical period. Nephritis 
occurs between the sixteenth and twenty-sixth days from the 
beginning of sore throat. During this period they appear to be 
depressed; and whether we regard nephritis as originating from 
bacteria or pyrexia, it is proper to spare them by avoiding irritating 
foods, such as beef -tea, soup, meat extracts, etc., during that period. 
Scarlatinal nephritis is most common in young children, and it is 
an easy matter to restrict them to milk, farinaceous foods, puddings, 
potatoes, vegetables, bread-and-butter. It is less common in 
adults, and greater latitude may be allowed in feeding. 

The treatment of nephritis from scarlatina and diphtheria does 



TV PHOT D rr.VFR 567 

not differ from that detailed under Acute Xepliritis (p 408). Milk 
is by far the best diet, but it may be diluted witli whey or barley- 
water, or mixed with arrowroot or oatmeal gruel. Imperial drink 
and similar fluids may be given to quench the thirst. If the albu- 
minuria persists longer than three weeks, the diet should be im- 
proved by the addition of eggs, tender meat, and digestible vege- 
tables. If there is a persistent dropsy, a chloride-free diet should 
be prescribed. It should not consist entirely of milk. The patient 
may have eggs, meat, salt-free bread, vegetables, saltless butter, 
cream, jam, l)oiled rice with golden syrup, sago, tapioca, custard, 
Iceland moss jelly, and other jellies. 

Typhoid or Enteric Fever, and the Typhoses. 

Typhoid fever presents itself in many forms, and has frequently 
been confounded with other diseases. The characteristic tem- 
perature curve, roseolar rash, enlargement of the spleen, and 
diarrhoea with peasoup stools, form the typhoid syndrome. Many 
of the cases originally diagnosed as typhoid may be found on closer 
inspection to belong to the group of diseases which have not in- 
aptly been termed the typhoses. This group includes — (i) Para- 
typhoid typhosis of Achard and Bensaude, in which the bacteria 
are intermediate between Eberth's Bacilltis typhosis and Bacillus 
coli ; (2) Landouzy's typho - bacillosis or septicaemia, due to 
Koch's Bacillus tuberculosis ; (3) Fournier's syphilitic typhosis, a 
typhoid form of syphilitic roseola; and (4) meningococcal typhosis, 
or typhoid cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis, with diarrhoea, rose- 
coloured spots, etc. All these affections require practically the 
same dietetic treatment, and they will be considered together. 

The Dietetics of Typhoid Fever and the Typhoses. — It has long been 
the custom to treat typhoid fever with fluid foods only. In 1894 
Cumow laid down the dietetic law that no typhoid patient should 
be allowed any solid food until the temperature has been normal 
for at least ten days. The reason given for this rule is the belief 
that the earlier administration of solid foods would cause a relapse, 
and probably perforation of the intestines. But it has not been a 
universal experience to find relapses, haemorrhage, perforation.' or 
other dire effects following the use of the ordinary fever diet, such as 
that given above (pp. 458-563). The subject has been much debated, 
and the experience of many physicians has led them to adopt some 
form of dietary very different from the fluid foods so strongly 
recommended by Curnow and others. Niemeyer, after stating the 
rule of fluid dietary, in 1874 wrote thus: " I have no hesitation in 
saying that the aggravation of the fever by eggs, meat, and milk 
has not been proved." In 1882 Hoesslin gave eggs, meat, soup, 
bread, milk, and porridge. In 1887 Khadgi gave a similar diet; 
and both concluded that the course of the fever was not greatly 
influenced by meat, eggs, and bread, when properly prepared. But 
the results obtained by other men have led to the adoption by 



568 FEVERS 

them of such different dietaries that they need to be classified. 
The}^ are as follows: (i) Water diet, tyaitement A la vide, or the 
empty bowel method; (2) scanty fare — milk, 20 to 30 ounces a day, 
and water; (3) whey; (4) moderate feeding — ordinary fever diet; 
(5) liberal feeding; (6) generous feeding. A few remarks on each 
will be given. 

Milk and Farinaceous Foods — Moderate Feeding. — The following 
is the dietarv I have used for more than thirty ^-ears, with satis- 
faction to myself and advantage to my patients; I have every 
confidence in it, and stronglj- recommend it: The daily food of 
an adult should consist of — Milk, 4 to 5 pints; sugar, 2 ounces; 
raw eggs, 2 or 3 ; beef-tea, mutton or chicken broth, i pint ; farina- 
ceous foods, q.s. ; custard and jelly, ad libitum. The milk should 
be given in doses of 5 to 7 ounces every two hours. Its digestion 
must be carefully watched. If milk curds appear in the stools, 
much valuable nutriment will be lost, and meteorism may be caused 
by the passage of such curds along the intestinal canal. This must 
be prevented by the use of barlej'-water, lime-water, citrate of soda, 
extract of malt, or peptonizing powders, to prevent the formation 
of masses of curd. Junket, made by commercial junket-powder, 
tablets, or essences, is a soft jelly-like substance in which the milk 
is curdled before it is consumed. The curdling of milk is also pre- 
vented by the use of farinaceous foods, which insure a subdivision 
of the casein. In an average case of typhoid fever, some of the 
milk can be thickened with arrowroot, cornflour (or starch), fine 
rice-flour, Mellin's, Savory and Moore's, and other foods. Benger's 
food is very useful. The sugars from these foods will be com- 
pletely absorbed; 85 to go per cent, of the starch wiU be absorbed. 
If less than this is taken up, it will have served a useful purpose 
in preventing the coagulation of casein in large and indigestible curds. 
The experiments in digestion and metabolism previously referred 
to (pp. 556, 576) show' that a considerable proportion of protein, 
fat, and carbohydrate will be digested. Even when there is much 
diarrhoea, the absorption of food is not greatly diminished, pro- 
viding the milk is not in large curds. Moreover, the diarrhoea can 
be more or less controlled by the combination of white of eggs, 
arrowroot, cornflour, cinnamon, or nutmeg with milk. Brandy 
wiU also assist in checking the diarrhoea. If the diarrhcea persists, 
beef-tea and yolk of eggs should be left out of the dietary. Mutton 
broth and chicken broth do not always provoke diarrhcea, even 
when beef-tea does so. When constipation occurs, cornflour and 
arrowroot must be avoided; beef -tea may now be useful, and some 
of the milk may be given with boiled bread, well-cooked fine oat- 
meal, glucose, treacle, demerara sugar, honey, apple sauce, apricot 
sauce, and fruit- juices [e.g., orange, lemon, grape, strawberry juice, 
etc.). 

As a general rule the patient may be allowed as much water and 
its variants as he desires; in fact, he should be encouraged to drink. 
Copious drinking increases the assimilation of proteins, improves 



TYPHOID FEVER 569 

the metabolism of nitrogen, increases arterial tension, and excretion 
by the skin, lungs, and kidneys. The existence of diarrhcea does 
nt)t preclude copious drinking. The water may be taken hot or 
cold, and flavoured with tea, lemon-juice, fruit-juice, or other 
agents previously mentioned in the fever diet. Alcohol may be 
required (see Fever Diet), but it is not necessary for every case, 
nor is it always beneficial. Diakanov found the temporary use of 
alcohol lowered the assimilation of protein by typhoid patients, 
the effect being greatest in those not accustomed to alcohol. It 
also lessened appetite and increased the amount of faeces, but it 
improved the general condition. 

The importance of carbohydrates in every case of fever has been 
commented on. When patients are badly fed, their tissues are 
rapidly destro^^ed, and acidosis occurs. Under these circumstances 
the use of carbohydrates is an essential part of the treatment. 
Moreover, it is believed that carbohydrates prevent the toxsemia, 
which is a marked feature of the disease, by preventing the forma- 
tion of toxins in the cellular tissues. At the same time they are 
protein-sparers. During his observations, Gairdner fed his patients 
with a mixture containing 7 ounces of milk, i ounce of cream, and 
I ounce of lactose, every three hours. The results were as follows: 
Absence of the typical typhoid facies; toxsemia less marked; rest- 
lessness and delirium less than usual; no marked emaciation; 
appetite was good, food well digested, stools formed; and the return 
to normal health was rapid. 

Foods to he avoided in Typhoid Fever. — Oatmeal, brown bread, 
bread crusts, toast, vegetables, and raw fruit. 

Convalescence is said to begin when the morning temperature sinks 
to the normal level. This is the usual period to begin making 
additions to the diet. The appetite now returns, the patient begins 
to be hungrv, and there are evidences that the body is ready for a 
larger dietary. But every addition must be experimental, although 
it is essential that sufficient be given to satisfy hunger. The food 
should be well cooked, and no irritating particles ought to pass the 
lips. Certain foods are absorbed almost entirely in the upper 
bowel, and these may usually be given without fear — e.g., rice, 
sago, and tapioca. Therefore a well-cooked milk pudding is 
usually safe to give. About the same time we can allow some 
boiled bread and milk, sponge cake, Madeira cake (without fruit), 
finger biscuits. Some scraped meat may be given as a sandwich 
two or three times a day. 

If the patient is going on w^ell, the temperature undisturbed by 
the former additions to the diet, and the period of lysis nearly over, 
as shown by the evening temperature approximating to the normal 
line, we may next allow a few teaspoonfuls of steamed fish (sole, 
plaice, whiting, weak- fish, or fresh haddock), the same amount of 
potato puree, and stale bread (free from crust). After four or five 
days, eggs (poached or boiled) may be allowed for breakfast; and 
breast of chicken or stewed rabbit, potato, vegetable marrow, and 



570 FEVERS 

pudding for dinner, A few days later some underdone beef or 
mutton ma}' be given. Ordinary diet should be attained in about 
two weeks from the establishment of normal temperature. 

Relapses. — If the morning temperature rise above normal, it is 
essential that the patient should be put back on the original diet 
until the cause of the p3Texia has been discovered. It may be 
due to constipation, phlebitis, superficial abscesses, otitis media, or 
a genuine recrudescence of typhoid from fresh infection. During 
con^•alescence of an ordinary case of tj^phoid fever, the temperature 
often sinks a degree or two below normal. This need not surprise 
us. The fierce oxidation in the tissues is over; the body is ex- 
hausted; nearl}^ all the glycogen and fat is burnt up, and muscular 
tissue alone is being oxidized, as it must be while the supply of 
food is deficient. The evening temperature may at the same time 
be a degree or two above normal. This is often due to starvation, 
and a few satisf3-ing meals will frequently bring it down. The 
morning temperature is the most important guide, and a rise of 
one degree above normal should cause a searching inquiry. A 
relapse is a rise of temperature and return of the symptoms of 
typhoid fever. It may be due to an enlarged spleen. In such a 
case the relapse is not due to overfeeding; it is quite as likely to 
occur in a patient fed with slops and other meagre fare as in one 
w^ho is well fed. It may also occur from constipation. There is 
no doubt that a relapse sometimes recurs from injudicious feeding, 
and especially after eating toasted bread. But these are not in- 
stances of genuine relapses; the temperature subsides as soon as 
the cause is removed. 

Water Diet (Starvation Diet, the Empty Bowel Treatment, or 
" Traitement a la Vide ").— This mode of treatment w^as commonly 
used on the Continent in the Middle Ages, and is still used to some 
extent, but is unpopular in England. The dietary consists of plenty 
of plain water, barley-water, oatmeal-water, and water-soup. A 
generation ago German and French physicians considered the 
administration of milk, eggs, broth, meat, and other nutritious 
articles decidedly injurious, and " water-soup " was regarded by 
them as the proper fever diet. The mortality from typhoid fever 
was much higher than in England, and this was attributed by 
Englishmen to the Continental treatment by starvation. Niemeyer 
admitted the truth of this assertion. I have already quoted his 
statement, but it is worth repeating: " I have no hesitation in 
saying that the aggravation of fever by giving the patient milk, 
eggs, and meat has not been proved by actual observation. . . . 
In everv' fever the consumption of the constituents of the body is 
greatly increased, and no sort of exercise will use up the body as 
rapidly as fever does. . . . Most fatal cases of fever are due to 
insufficient material being furnished for the replacement of that 
used up. Even in the most favourable cases during convalescence 
we see greatly debilitated patients, who have lost 15 to 20 pounds 
in weight, recover slowly. These facts urge us to give milk, eggs, 



I 



TYPHOID FEVF.R 57^ 

and even meat, etc., until it shall be proven that such diet increases 
the fever." Traitcment d hi vide includes the consumption of a 
very large amount of water. By this means the waste of the tissues 
is washed out of the body, the nitrogenous materials being more 
efficiently oxidized, the proportion of N of urea to N of purins 
being nearer the normal level — that is to say, nitrogen metabolism 
is improved both quantitatively and qualitatively. The copious 
drinking of water also increases the excretion by the skin and 
lungs, and raises the arterial tension. Copious water-drinking 
along with other food is now recommended for all fevers. As a 
general rule, 3, 4, or 5 pints a day may be allowed, in addition to 
milk. But the forced consumption of 8 to 10 pints a day by 
typhoid patients is another matter. In 1890 the effects of water 
were investigated by Diakonov, Matzkevich, Grudiev and Puritz, 
and by Debove in 1894, and more recently by Gushing and Clarke. 
The occurrence of diarrhcea does not preclude the consumption of 
a large amount of water. The urine is increased, and toxins are 
removed with the debris of the tissues. The beneficial effects most 
obvious are the diminution of restlessness, headache, delirium, and 
other consequences of the toxemia. But it has no influence on the 
temperature, pulse, or rate of respiration. Meteorism is rather fre- 
quent. Another point of importance in connection with copious 
drinking is the removal of mineral salts from the body. Febrile 
urine always contains a larger proportion of potassium than normal 
urine, but a diminution of sodium salts. Rohmann found that 
chlorides are not excreted in the faeces or urine during fever, and 
the chlorides in the blood are diminished; therefore they must be 
retained in the tissues. 

The observations recorded on p. 572 were made by Gramatchikov 
on cases of typhoid fever. The food in every case consisted of 
bread and milk, and in some cases, even during the fever, meat was 
added. During the fever there was an increased excretion of 
potassium salts. The metabolism of Sodium was also increased, 
but in a lesser degree; the metabolism of calcium and magnesium 
was very little changed; and the metabolism of nitrogen, sulphuric, 
and phosphoric acid was increased. 

Necessity for Chlorides. — In t>'phoid patients the chlorides of the urine 
are diminished. This may be due to a smaller consumption or diminished 
excretion of salt by the kidneys, increased excretion of chlorides by the bowels, 
or retention of chlorides in the tissues. Chlorides of sodium, potassium, and 
calcium are necessary for proper metabolism, to preserve the integrity of 
the blood-plasma, for the functioning of leucocytes, and for proper cardiac 
action. We do not know the meaning of chloride retention; it may be of a 
protective character. It does not occur in every case, and appears to depend 
on the total amount of liquids consumed, and chiefly on the consumption of 
milk: 4 pints of milk contain from 45 to 50 grains of NaCl, of which a normal 
person retains about 20 grains and a typhoid person 35 grains. WTien the 
patient consumes 5 or 6 pints of water in addition to the niilk, the chlorides 
are not retained. The excessive water drinking leads to depletion of the 
sy.stem of chlorides. A t\"phoid patient drinking g or m pints of fluid a 
day may retain a smaller proportiomof chlorides than a normal person taking

ordinary footl. Ilotfmann and Sollmann found that, given a superabundance 
of water, any addition of chlorides to the food was followed by a prompt 
increase of chlorides of the urine. A dilute saline solution is absorbed more 
readily than plain water, and it is believeil the depletion of the system ot 
its chlorides is prevented by alkaline carbonates given in the water. It is 
therefore recommended that each pint of water should contain 25 grains of 
sodium chloride, 12 grains of potassium bicarbonate, and a dessertspoonful 
of lemon juice or fruit syrup, and some sugar to flavour it. 

Whey Diet.- -Williams, believing that the exhausting diarrhoea 
of t}phuid was due to irritation of the mucous membrane by food, 
endeavoured to carry out the treatment by allowing tlie patients 
plenty of water to drink, and in some cases as little as ^ pint of 
milk a day. Ewart recommended whey as a food which leaves a 
very small residue. Ker also says: " If milk is badly tolerated, 
an admirable substitute is to be found in whey." The amount of 
whe}- recommended by Ewart is 2^ to 4 pints in twenty-four hours, 
some sugar and 15 grains of salt being added to each pint. When 
meteorism (if it occurs) has subsided, he orders white of eggs and 
cream. If the fseces are satisfactory, and the food agrees, he 
adds fruit juices, jellies, honey, and vegetable soup. The food 
value of this diet must be examined. Droop Richmond states 
the average composition of whey is as follows: Lactose 4-45, 
protein 1-24, ash 0-52, per cent. The fat rarely exceeds 0-5 per 
cent., and may be less. Therefore 5 litres (8| pints) contain 
carbohydrate 222-5, protein 62, fat i7'5, grammes; and energy, 
1,324 cedories. This quantity, wiiich is double the amount pre- 
scribed b}^ Ewart, is a very small provision for a person whose 
metabolism is increased 20 per cent, by fever. The addition of 
2 ounces of sugar, two raw eggs, 7 ounces of cream, and 8 ounces 
of calves'-foot jelly, would raise the proteins to go grammes, and 
the energy to 2,147 calories; but it would still be a poor diet for 
fever, although it should not be despised under certain conditions, 
such as inability of the patient to take milk, prolonged vomiting, 
etc. 

Buttermilk contains moi;e proteins, the composition being as 
follows: Water 90-83, proteins y^y, fat 0-31, sugar 4"50, ash o-8i, 
per cent. It might be used with the same success as whey. Stoos 
found the acidity of buttermilk a disadvantage in cases of vomiting, 
but other practitioners have not raised the same objection to it. 

Milk Diet (Scanty Fare). — Milk has long been recognized as the 
staple diet for typhoid fever. The present writer quite agrees 
with this, but does not agree that it should be the sole diet. Among 
recent writers Ker advocates the employment of a scanty milk diet 
during the acute stage of typhoid, and also in relapses and pro- 
longed fever. He orders the patient to be fed every two hours 
from 4 a.m. to midnight with 3 ounces of mUk, making a total of 
33 ounces of milk in twenty-four hours. In addition, he recom- 
mends 7 ounces of hot beef-tea or chicken broth to be given tliree 
times a day. The total value of this diet is 49 grammes of protein, 
and at most Sou calorics. He does not allow any farinaceous food

mitil a few days after tfie temperature returns to normal. The 
milk is to be always well diluted with water, soda-water, etc. He 
sa3's it is seldom advantageous to increase the milk to 4 ounces 
every two hours, and that is his maximum allowance. The dangers 
from such a scanty diet are acidosis and the consequences thereof. 

Milk and Farinaceous Food (Moderate Fare). — It must be ad- 
mitted that milk alone may give rise to a considerable amount of 
trouble. Ker says; "The value of milk is beyond all question, 
and is still recognized by most authorities as the most suitable diet 
in enteric fever. There are, however, few foods capable of doing 
more harm." If milk is the sole diet, and more is ingested than 
the alimentary canal can deal with, large masses of curd are left 
rmdigestcd, and irritate the ileum and colon. The curdling of milk 
is natural, but it can be prevented by the use of farinaceous foods, 
such as Benger's, Mellin's, baked flour, fine oatmeal, boiled bread 
rubbed through a sieve, barley-water, lime-water, etc. By fol- 
lowing out the dietary of the author, previously detailed, the patient 
can take a larger quantity of milk at each meal, and the total pro- 
vision of food will be moderately increased. With respect to diar- 
rhoea, it may be stated its occurrence has little effect on the digestion 
and assimilation of properly prepared food. Moreover, some car- 
bohydrates serve the triple purpose of loosening the curd, checking 
diarrhoea, and preventing acidosis. 

Milk-free Diet.- — Patients can be carried through typhoid fever 
without any milk at all. It was claimed by Sibert^ that the course 
of the disease is thereby shortened. He dieted his patients in the 
following manner: On the first day he gave nothing but water and 
a dose of calomel. On the foUowing day soup made of rice, barley, 
and oatmeal; this was strained, and mixed with yolk of eggs and 
extract of meat. Later on he gave meat broth, and allowed the 
patient to eat zwiebach. Hydrochloric acid was given between 
meals; and the bowels were irrigated daily. He claimed that the 
patients became convalescent much sooner than with milk diet. 
The temperature was lowered, complications pre^'ented, nervous 
symptoms fewer, and mortality diminished. Strong also treated 
cases with milk-free diet consisting of broth, crackers, zwiebach, 
rice, and gelatin. He considered the results justify its use. He 
said there was less prostration, no diarrhoea or tympanites, the 
tongue became clean and moist. He sometimes gave pepsin and 
hydrocliloric acid after meals, but intestinal irrigations were not 
regularly used. Kemp endorsed the use of milk-free diet, and con- 
sidered milk was one of the principal causes of danger in typhoid, 
because the motor power as well as the digestive function of the 
stomach was defective in the acute stage of typhoid. He employed 
rectal irrigations regularl}-. 

" Liberal " and " Abundant " Dietaries.^ — Hippocrates used to 
feed fever patients with flour soup. A little later it became the 
custom to give an ordinary diet. In the Middle Ages the patient

TYPHOID FEVER 575 

was starved or fed on water soup. But in the nineteenth century 
Graves in Ireland and Trousseau in France objected to the treat- 
ment by starvation, and were the lirst to employ diet of a nourish- 
ing character. But the treatment by " low diet " was used a 
long time, and it was not until after Hoesslin's experiment in 
digestion by typhoid patients that any notable improvement 
occurred. Of late years many physicians have given a far more 
abundant dietary. Klcmpcrer,^ for instance, says the increased 
consumption of the albuminoid tissues, and the great amount of 
" cast-off cell protoplasm," demands an increased supply of material; 
about 2,500 to 2,800 calories are required to satisfy the organism 
and for repairs in the cell protoplasm. Bauer also believed that 
an abundance of protein is necessary; that some is used in the con- 
struction of new cells, and it allays the craving of the organism for 
albumin. 

Theoretically, a liberal and varied diet ought to be of great value 
to obviate the waste of tissues arising from the enormous oxidation 
which is going on. The body wastes considerably on a scanty diet, 
and the suggestion is forced upon us that the heart and intestines 
must be proportionately affected; indeed, the intestines are often 
extremely thin in fatal cases examined post mortem. Many authori- 
ties have prescribed a liberal dietary without experiencing those 
dire results which are predicted by men in the opposite camp. And 
some of those who prescribe very scanty fare during the acute stage 
advocate a speedy return to more abundant diet as soon, as the 
morning temperature becomes normal. Thus Ker^ is " convinced 
that the use of solid food early in convalescence does much to 
shorten the duration of the case . . . the liberal supply of food at 
this period helps to promote the healing process in the ulcerated 
intestines, and to repair the waste caused by fever . . . and prob- 
alily prevents such sequelae as periostitis, abscesses, and otitis 
media." If a more liberal dietary is justihable the moment the 
morning temperature drops to normal, may it not be equally justi- 
fiable at an earlier period — say, the beginning of lysis, when the 
appetite returns ? As a matter of fact, such dietaries have long 
been in use. In 1886 Kadgi of St. Petersburg gave the following 
diets: (i) Milk 1,110, bread 155, meat 21, broth 92, grammes; 
(2) milk 1,345, bread 701, grammes; (3) milk 714, bread 154, meat 
65, broth 51, grammes; (4) milk 703, bread 86, meat 42, broth 149, 
grammes; (5) milk 790, bread 103, meat 74, and broth 187, grammes. 
He found 83 "9 per cent, of the protein was absorbed. 

In 1890 Matzkevich gave a mixed diet of bread, cutlets, and milk 
during the febrile stage. The protein of meat and bread was 
digested, as well as that of milk. Grudiev gave as much as 735 
grammes of bread with milk and plenty of water. Gramatchikov 
gave as much as 180 and 192 grammes of meat. 

In the same year Puritz made observations on abundant diet

in the acute stage of typhoid; he fed patients with bread, meat, 
milk, and wine, including i8o grammes of protein, 60 to 90 grammes 
of fat, and 300 grammes of carbohydrate — enough for a man doing 
a hard day's work. He compared the patients with others to 
whom he gave a light diet, containing 40 grammes of protein, 10 to 
20 grammes of fat, and 100 to 150 grammes of carbohydrate; and 
he arrived at the conclusion that patients with t3-phoid fever can 
eat with impunity and digest considerable quantities of protein 
and carbohydrate when they take plenty of water or similar fluids. 

Finall}-, the observations of Hoesslin^ made in 1882 on the digesti- 
bility of various foods by typhoid patients may again be quoted. 
These investigations were made in the hospital at the time when 
Rubner was conducting his investigations on the digestibility of 
foods by healthy men. The following items are from the series of 
diets given bj-Hoesslin to typhoid patients: (i) Soup, 1,583 grammes; 
(2) 29 egg yolks, and 2,500 grammes of soup; (3) 1,994 grammes of 
porridge, made of coarse oatmeal ; (4) 1,556 grammes extract of meat 
(5) 396 grammes of ham; (6) 100 grammes of rice; (7) 24 egg yolks 
(8) 3,000 gramm.es of milk; (9) 977 grammes of white of egg 
(10) 3,778 grammes of porridge from coarse wheat-ffour, and 300 
grammes of wine; (11) 1,750 grammes of milk; (12) 471 grammes of 
ham; (13) 1,500 grammes of milk; (14) 494 grammes of ham; 
(15) 1,400 grammes extract of meat, 500 grammes of soup, and 
400 grammes of wine. In each case the food was carefully pre- 
pared, and analyzed to ascertain its exact composition. The faeces 
and urine were collected and analyzed. Many of the patients had 
more or less diarrhoea. When diarrhfea was severe, the dry matter 
of the jcBces was not materially increased. When the fever was 
moderate, the digestion and assimilation of protein, fat, and carbo- 
hydrate w^as not much different from that in healthy persons. 
There is, therefore, little doubt that food can be digested. But it 
is reasonable to recommend care in the preparation of the food. 

In 1897 A. G. Barrs^ of Leeds made a plea for the prescription 
of a less restricted dietary in typhoid fever. He said: " No one 
can fail to be impressed with the extreme emaciation, feebleness, 
and prolonged disablement which that disorder entails." He pre- 
scribed bread-and-butter, poached eggs, minced meat, bacon, rice 
pudding, custard, stewed fruit, sponge cake, porridge and milk, etc., 
to patients whose temperature was 100° to 101° F. in the morning, 
and 101° to 102° F. in the evening. He said: " I do not give solid 
food to patients suffering from enteric when they cannot take it; 
but if a patient can take solid food, I give it him. That solid food, 
when the patient's appetite and digestion permit him to take it, 
is deleterious in the presence of pyrexia is incorrect. I am unable 
to find any reliable observations which support the notion. . . . 
When a patient likes a thing and has appetite for it, it is a sure 
indication it wiU agree, be digested, absorbed, assimilated, and

tend to the well-being and not to the undoing of the patient. It is 
my rule, therefore, to give a typhoid patient such wholesome solid 
or liquid food as he likes, wishes for, and enjoys. I do not give 
solid food to all cases. To give a patient with a dry, shrivelled 
tongue, teeth covered with sordes, semi-comatose, and indifferent 
to all around him, especialh- to food, meat and otiier solids would be 
as cruel as to withhold it from one who is genuinely hungry. . . . 
It is difficult for me to conceive any method of treatment more 
calculated to delay healing of the ulcers and favour perforation 
than the prolonged system of starvation which fluid feeding adds 
to the devastating effects of pyrexia." 

These observations are not accepted by the generality of the pro- 
fession without question. There is strong opposition in some 
quarters to the employment of solid food until ten days after the 
temperature is normal. West^ is convinced that too early and in- 
cautious use of solid food is attended by considerable risk of relapse. 
" I have seen relapse follow so often that I cannot question the fact; 
and the relapses have occurred not only when solid food has been 
given prematurelv, but when the change of diet has been from one 
kind of liquid to another. I have seen it follow orange-juice or 
grape-juice without pips. The risk is a relapse — a recrudescence 
of the disease — with all its consequences. . . . Opinions differ 
widely as to what is the best diet. To my mind it matters little, 
so long as the diet is liquid, sufficient in quantity, agrees with the 
patient, and is not changed." 

But other physicians have given solid food without fear, and 
their results, as far as ultimate recovery is concerned, have been 
equally good, and they claim to have had few^er cases of hjemorrhage 
and perforation. Bushuyer gave the following dietary during the 
acute stage; it is an extreme example of liberal feeding with solid 
food, and is one I should not recommend: 

Early Breakfast. — Tea, roll and butter. 

Breakfast. — Given in three parts: 8 a.m., porridge made of boiled oatmeal, 
barley, or wheatmeal, 13 fluid ounces; 9 o'clock, two eggs, boiled soft or hard 
as the patient likes; 10 o'clock, a cutlet, roll, and tumblerful of milk. 

Lunch, 12.30. — A breakfast-cupful of clear souj) or beef tea, and an equal 
<juantity of jelly. 

Tea, 3 p.m. — A roll and butter, tea with cream and sugar. 

Dinner. — 6 p.m. a cupful of chicken broth or beef-tea, breast of chicken, 
potato puree, milk pudding, or milk to drink; 8 p.m., a roll and butter, milk 
to drink. 

During the Night. — Milk-tea or coffee made with milk, a cupful given twice 
or thrice. 

Stimulants. — Wine (i to 3 ounces) at i<> or 11 a.m., and a tablespoonful of 
brandy mixture every two hours. 

Bushuyer made every effort to stimulate the appetite, and con- 
sidered that when the patient could be interested in his food, the 
general condition of his organism rapidly improved. There is no 
doubt that the characteristic apathy of typhoid is one of the worst

features jf the condition. Out of 398 cases treated by Busliuyer 
with the above dietar}- rehipses were not common, only four had 
haemorrhage, only one had a perforation, and the mortality was 
only 8*2 per cent. 

'1 he dietary of Sliattuck,^ of the Massachusetts General Hospital, 
is rather more moderate in character, and the majority of the 
articles included in it may be recommended with safety; indeed, 
many of them ha.ve been prescribed by me for thirty years. Shat- 
tuck's dietary is derived from the following list, and the amount of 
protein, fat, and carboh3'dratc recommended is the same as for 
a healthy individual. 

Milk, hot or cold, with or without salt, lime-water, soJa-water, Apollinaris, 
\'ichy, or other alkaline waters; peptogenic powder or peptonized milk; 
milk with whole egg, white of egg, tea, coffee, or cocoa. 

Soups, made of beef, mutton, veal, chicken, oysters, peas, beans, squash, or 
tomato; they should be strained and thickened with rice-Hour, wheat-flour, 
barley, arrowroot, eggs and cream, Horlick's malted milk, or Mellin's food. 

Cream, cream and barley-water; whey, buttermilk, koumiss, Matzoon. 

Beef-juice, bovinine, carnipeptone, somatose. 

Gruel, made of cornmeal or oatmeal and strained, and farinaceous foods. 

Eggs, soft boiled, raw, or in egg-nog; ice-cream. 

Meat, scraped or finely minced; the soft part of raw oysters. 

Puddings, soft puddings without currants or raisins; macaroni, blanc- 
mange, apple-sauce, wine jelly. 

Soft crackers with tea, soup, or egg-nog; soft toast without crust. 

Drink: plain water, barley-water, lemon-water, albumin-water, tea, coffee, 
and cocoa. 

Strause, in urging the use of a similar dietary, says the absorption 
of meat and soft foods is only 5 to 10 per cent, less than in a norfnal 
person. \Mien patients are fed on a liberal dietary, the death- 
rate is lower, perforation and haemorrhage less frequent than in 
those fed on fluid and less satisfying diet, and, with the exception 
of a slight increase in the percentage of relapses, the results are 
all in favour of liberal feeding; and the amount of food should be 
not less than that allowed for a health}- person. Kinnicutt also 
recommends the dietary, and gave the following figures: In 4,654 
cases of typhoid fed on a liquid diet, relapses occurred in 10 "88 per 
cent., haemorrhage in 883 per cent., perforation in 2'40 per cent., 
and death in 10-55 per cent. In 733 cases fed liberally relapses 
occurred in 11 38 per cent., haemorrhage in only 477 per cent., 
perforation only in 1-36 per cent., and death only in 9-47 per cent. 
of cases. 

Acute Rheumatism (Rheumatic Fever). 

The occurrence of an excess of acids in the perspiration during 
acute rheumatism suggests that these are the cause of the disease. 
1 his is the humoral theory. '1 he bacterial theory is more popular. 
Moreover, various bacilli, micrococci, and diplococci found in the 
joints produce on cultivation formic, acetic, lactic, butyric, and 
propionic acids.

Ihc luud should ccjnsist entirely of milk and watery ttuids so 
long as the acute symptoms last. Each pint ol milk should have 
^ teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda or potash, and J teaspoonful 
of common salt, added to it. Four pints a day will be required 
to meet the physiological requirements of the body while at rest 
in bed. 1 his should be the standard for a man, and a woman or 
child should have a proportionate amount. But even this liberal 
allowance of liquid will not suffice to meet the demands of the 
organism. The fever and drenching perspiration cause great thirst. 
It is therefore proper to dilute the milk with one-thirri of barley- 
water, oatmeal-water, soda-water, Perrier, Apollinaris, Salutaris, 
or other gaseous water. By these means the tendency of milk to 
form hard curds will be obviated. In a very bad case 2 grains 
of citrate of soda may be added, instead of the bicarbonate, to each 
ounce of milk. Milk often coats the tongue and causes a dry mouth. 
These are usual effects of the milk diet. It may be relieved by other 
drinks, taken extra- — e.g., imperial drink, lemon-water, apple-water, 
plain water, whey, tamarind whey, buttermilk. One ounce of 
lemon-juice contains 30 to 45 grains of citric acid, which is anti- 
rheumatic. It is hardly necessary to add that broth, soup, meat 
extract, jelly, and other articles containing meat bases and purins 
should be prohibited. 

When the acute stage is passing off, some oatmeal gruel, l^arley 
meal, farinaceous food, custard, junket, jelly, or milk pudding may 
be given. Von Xoorden and Mohr consider oatmeal the best food 
for ail acid auto-intoxications; Winter asserts that all cereals are 
equalh- valuable. Malted, dextrinized, and predigested cereal foods 
should not be used, but only freslily prepared cereals; neither should 
much sugar be allowed with them. 

The next addition, after cereals, should be stale bread-and-butter, 
and potatoes baked in their skins, so that the potassium salts are 
retained. About the same time we may add some fresh fruit, 
especially grapes, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, logan- 
berries, and oranges; they should be eaten without sugar. Sugar- 
containing roots and tubers, such as beets, yams, sweet potatoes, 
etc., should be forbidden. 

The first animal food should consist of eggs in the iorm of custard, 
soup with eggs, and poached or boiled eggs. After a day or two, 
if these agree, some boiled light fish may be given; and in a few 
days chicken panada, breast of chicken ; and finally tender mutton 
or underdone beef. Care must be taken not to increase the animal 
food very rapidl}-. When chicken or meat is allowed, it may be 
accompanied by potatoes, spinach, cauliflower, kidney beans, a 
spoonful or two of green peas, vegetable marrow, boiled celery, 
or lettuce. 

Meat soups should not be allowed for a week or two after meat. 
But vegetable soups ma}' be allowed about the same time as eggs 
and lish. Onion, mint, leek, celer}-, lettuce, endive, tarragon, 
savor}-, cabbage, and other vegetables should be boiled together 



58o FEVERS 

for several hours until the whole is reduced to a puree; it should 
then be mixed \vith some boiled milk and a raw egg, to give protein 
and fat, and seasoned with salt and pepper. 

After convalescence the patient must be careful to avoid any 
cause of gastro-intestinal irritation or catarrh and hepatic hyper- 
?emia, which are belie\ed to delay complete restoration from acute 
and subacute rheumatism. Tea, coffee, and especially alcohol, 
should be avoided for a long time if they cause the least indigestion. 
All general hygienic measures capable of promoting the establish- 
ment of good general health and freedom from metabolic disorders 
s'.iould be adopted.

CHAPTER XXIII 

THE VITAMINES AND THE DEFICIENCY DISEASES 

Tiiic chief constituents of foods ;irc jjroteins, fats, carb(»liydrates, 
and salts. Hut clinical and experimental observations show that 
foods contain son^iethint^ more than albumin, globulin, ijlutelin, 
casein, stearin, palmitin, olein, sugar, starch, and dextrin. V'^ery 
many foods contain an exceedingly small but important amount of 
accessory substances, which have recently been shown to be essential 
for the growth, development, and well-being of the organism. When 
these substances are excluded from the food, the body suffers, and 
sooner or later becomes subject to various diseases. What these 
substances are and the role they play in metabolism is the subject 
of considerable discussion and investigation. Light has been 
thrown on them by recent researches. Various substances have 
been isolated whose presence in foods influences favourably the 
well-being of the organism, and whose absence tends to tlie opposite 
condition. Among these are the substances called vitamines. It 
has long been known that animals grow quicker, larger, and become 
heavier when fed with some kinds of foods than others. It has also 
been known a long time that when people are fed with amQiiat- 
onous diet — e.g., rice, maize, white bread, pickled meat, ancTcanned 
fTmcls— ^flie body suffers and cert ain diseases are de^•elopc d. These 
diseases are due to the absence of ^•i _tan^ines, and they are cured by 
the administtation of substances~^whTcTi contain them. There is, 
for instance, a growth-producing vitamine in fresh milk, eggs, meat, 
yeast, meat extract, yeast extract, in growing grain {e.g., malt), 
and in all grains which have not been deprived of the pericarp 
(wheat, oats, barley, red rice, maize), and in the substances which 
have been removed from them (e.g., wheat bran, rice bran, maize 
bran, the germ of wheat and other cereals, and malt culms), and 
in Hongo or Katjang idjo beans, and all rapidly growing vegetables. 
Hut there are other vitamines than those which promote growth 
in eggs, meat, fish, brain, cereals, legumes, fresh vegetables, and 
veast. This is shown by ill-effects resulting from the absence of 
fresh foods , and the beneficial effects which follow their use. In 
fact, most fresh animal and vegetable juices contain vitamines. 
They are chemical organic substances which are easilvdestroved_bv_ 
exposure to heat, and soon perish if they a re kTy FT^heir exact 
chemical nature has noFlSeen^worlced ouTtffevery case, but they 
are known to be derivatives of nuclein and nucleic acids. Their

importance is obvious. Professor Leonard Hill says: " Foods con-

\''iTAMi\ES AND GROVvTff.^^^^Tlie work of Osborne, Mendel, 
Hopkins,^ McCollum and Davis,^ shows that there is in some foods 
a specific growth-producing vitamine. 

Vitamines in Milk. — F. Gowland Hopkins conducted feeding 
experiments illustrating the necessity for " accessory " substances 
in normal dietaries, and read a paper before the Royal Society of 
Medicine in October, 1913, in which he demonstrated the necessity 
of vitamines for normal growth. Groups of young rats were fed 
on a basal diet of casein, fat, carbohydrates, and salts. They were 
compared with other rats fed with the same diet plus a minute 
ration of fresh milk. The amount of food consumed was practically 
the same throughout. The former rats soon ceased to grow; the 
latter grew normally. The small addition of milk imparted to the 
diet some substance which was essential. What the actual sub- 
stances are in milk which so markedly, although in a secondar\' 
way, affected the grow^th is not yet known. The milk vitamines 
are destroyed by boiling it. One laborator\' fact has been pointed 
out* which might well be followed up. Milk which is preserved 
by hydrogen peroxide readily causes scurvy. It is deprived of its 
antiscorbutic properties; in other words, hydrogen peroxide has a 
specific effect on the vitamines.

hall tin- mortality in Manila consists of infants under one ycar_of 
ju^iiyantl half tluMnfaiits wTTo die show some sij^Mi of beri-beri. As 
tnree-fourths of the infants arc breast-fed, there is an undeniable 
relationship between the milk and the absence of f^'nnvth, develf)p- 
ment. and sound health. Manila infants fed l:)y a healthy niother 
or with fresh cow's milk do not develop beri-beri, but develop 
normally, which shows the milk of healthy women contains vita- 
mines, that of unhealthy women does not. The disease is also 
cured by feeding the infants with fresh cow's milk or other sub- 
stances which are proved to contain vitamines. 

Experiments have recently been made in feeding animals with 
isolated proteins to discover their efficiency or otherwise as a food 
material. Osborne and MendeP fed rats with isolated proteins, 
fat, sugar, starch, and salts. But the food was deficient; they 
failed to gyo'w. A preparation of protein-free milk was subse- 
(luently added to the diet; this contained the milk-sugar, salts, and 
unknown components of milk. Rats which were malnourished 
and failed to grow on the former diet resumed their growth and 
became " re-alimented " as soon as the protein-free milk was added, 
and were carried through two generations. Thus adequate growth 
was noted when the sole protein consisted of casein, lactalbumin, 
egg-albumin, edestin, glutenin, and glycinin. Rats which had 
developed marked symptoms of decline on isolated proteins were 
revived in a way little short of marvellous when protein-free milk 
was given as part of the food; thereby it was shown that there are 
in milk traces of essential compounds which promote growth and 
are essential for that purpose. Further observations were made by 
Osborne, Mendel, Ferry and Wakeman,- when they concluded 
that the " vitamines" of milk are to be found in the butter-fat 
fraction, but their chemical nature is unknown. Osborne and 
MendeF had previously shown by feeding rats on fnt-free foods that 
it was not fat itself which causes growth; the rats continued to 
grow and thrive on a diet completely free from fat, and almost free 
from lipoids. The diet certainly did not contain any significant 
quantity of phosphatides and cerebrosides (see Lipoids, p. 613). 

Similar observations have been made on chickens. Casimir 
Funk fed chickens on casein, fat, carbohydrate, and salts. The 
chickens ceased to grow and developed polyneuritis, which is the 
beri-beri of birds. He concluded this was due to the absence of 
vitamines. Other chickens were fed with ordinary food, and they 
grew normally. He then fed some chickens with polished white 
rice; they ceased to grow, developed beri-beri, and died quickly. 
He also fed chickens on unpolished rice; these birds also ceased to 
grow, but did not develop beri-beri. Other birds were fed with 
unpolished rice and yeast, and they grew slowly. The conclusion 
drawn from the observation is that nomial food contains a growth 
\itamine, but it is not the same as the beri-beri vitamine.

THE VITA MINES AND THE DEFICIENCY DISEASES 



Tliese observations are very suggestive. It is not uncommon to 
see children of stunted growth, even when tliere is no evidence of 
hypothvroidism. Tliis is probably due to the absence of the 
specific growth vitamine from their food. 

Vitamines in Wheat and Flour. — Experiments have shown that 
as regards digestibility and availability, bread made from ordinar\^ 
household or bread fiour and from patent flour have a superiority 
over brown and so-called " standard bread." Dr. HamilP examined 
the evidence published with regard to the nutriti\'e value of various 
kinds of flour. Entire wheat flour, both stone ground and so-called 
" standard " or 80 per cent, flour, contain less available protein 
than patent or standard patent flour. But there is a difference in 
entire wheat flour and 80 per cent, flour, owing to the presence of 
small l)ranny particles and the germ of v/heat, which contain addi- 
tional constituents and have a value of their own in nutrition. 
Among tliese constituents are phosphorus-containing organic com- 
pounds and other substances which may prove to be of importance 
in nutrition. This consideration applies to wholemeal flour and 
germ flour, and the bread made from them. 

It is an undeniable fact, proved by many experiments, that a vast 
difference exists in the effects on animals of entire wheatmeal and 
ordinary white flour. This difference is due neither to protein nor 
phosphates. During the controversy on standard bread, the 
Millers' Association obtained analyses of four kinds of flour made 
from the same lot of w^heat, and the results were as follows: 



I'rotein. 



Phosphates.

bread flour . . 

3. Wholemeal flour 

4. Standard or 80 per cent, flour

The difference as regards protein and phosphates was actually 
in favour of white flour and bread. But it has been shown that the 
value of different parts of the grain for nutritive purposes cannot be 
determined merely by an estimation of the protein, fat, and carbo- 
hydrate. Biological experiments are necessary for this purpose. 
Milk drawn from a healthy animal contains all the groups necessary 
for the growth of the young mammal. The wheat grain or berry 
contains all the groups necessary' for the growth of the young plant, 
and there is nothing in the grain w^hich is not useful for the growth 
of the sprout. Hill and Flack^ showed distinctly that rats fed on 
entire wheatmeal, standard flour (80 per cent.), and Hovis flour

nutrition of rats fed on white Hour was likely to suffer from the 
absence of cellulose, the latter element being a sine qua non of proper 
luitrition in animals possessing a long intestinal canal, like rodents. 
Nevertheless, sufficient observations have been made to prove the 
\alue of those substances in whole wheatmeal which are deficient 
in white flour and bread. Pigeons were fed by Edie and Simpson* 
Willi white bread and wholemeal, or standard bread. Those fed 
witli standard bread maintained their weight, paired, and laid 
eggs; those feci with wliite bread immediately began to lose weight, 
manifested illness, and developed polyneuritis. Some of the latter 
died; others were cured, and recovered their weight and fitness 
when fed on whole grain or whole grain and yeast. It was con- 
cluded that the parts of wheat removed in milling include substances 
which are necessarv for growth, maintenance of nutrition, and even 
life itself. These "substances are important both for the growing 
and adult animal. The milling of wheat, therefore, is a question of 
national importance. This, however, is by no means the first time 
the matter has been discussed. The question of standardizing 
bread was discussed in great detail and debated in the House of 
Commons in 1768 ;2 in fact, " the bread problem has exercised the 
minds of rulers of the people from the earliest period of English 
history." J. H., writing in 1773, says: "Whatever mixtures of 
grain or qualities of bread might be the food of some of our ancestors, 
the common standard of bread, from Alfred's time down to the 
eighth of Queen Anne, was three-fourths of the wheat, which repre- 
sented all the flour." The writer says we went on very w^ell for 
800 vears, but in Queen Anne's time it was thought proper that 
three sorts of breacTshould be assized, " so that instead of flour for 
bread and bran that remained, assize bread became a mvstcry, 
and we no longer knew what we were eating." The miller divided 
the flour, but in the attempt to prepare one for white, another for 
wheaten, and the third for household bread, the inferior kind 
became disagreeable to the taste of those accustomed to finer 
liread. The inferior bread contained the pollard and fine bran, 
which few people chose to eat if they could obtain the finer kind, 
and so the people, rejecting what the}' called " brown " bread, took 
to the wheaten, which thev called " white" bread, and from that 
dav to the present the greatest attention has been paid to the 
V>roduction of the finest and whitest bread. But to obtain the 
finest flour and whitest bread it has become necessary to remove all 
the bran and the germ. Bv so doing, however, the miller and 
l)aker have impoverished the flour and bread of some of the most 
important constituents — viz., the vitamines, enzymes, activators, 
amino-acids and lipoids, which onlv exist in the germ and sub- 
pericarpal lavors of the bran of wheat. The removal of these

586 THE VITAMINES AXD THE DEEFCIEXCY DISEASES 

substances does not matter very much in the case of well-to-do 
families, where fresh milk, animal foods, and vegetables containing 
vitamines are constantly a part of the daily diet. But it matters 
greatly to children of the poor, whose chief diet is white bread. 
Hill and Flack, who fed rats on various flours, proved that the germ 
and bran of wheat are necessarv' to make them grow; Edie and 
Simpson showed pigeons also require them. Growing plants 
require all the grain contains, and the children of the poor ought 
to be given what growing animals and sprouting corn require. 
Centuries ago bread corn had to be ground in the quern, an ancient 
means of grinding still used by native races, and it was never free 
from the germ and bran. Races of people are to-day fed with 
oatmeal, r\'emeal, and barley-meal, which are never so finely milled 
as white flour. Barley bread was formerly a staple food in England. 
The superior results obtained from feeding animals on meal which 
is not deprived of the germ and bran led to investigations into the 
differences in composition. Obser\'ations have shown that proteins 
are not equalh' efticient for maintaining growth, and some of them 
are deficient in particular amino-acids. Zein or maize protein is 
deficient in trj^ptophane; it does not cause growth, and is insufficient 
to maintain life. Mice fed on zein plus tn,'ptophane lived longer 
than on zein alone. It appears that the superior value of standard 
and wholemeal bread is due in part to the fact that tryptophane 
and other important amino-acids are split off earher in digestion 
than from white flour. To test this point Hopkins digested various 
flours with pancreatic extract, and estimated the amount of trypto- 
phane liberated. The digestion of the germ itself gave the least 
evidence of tryptophane; but the digestion of standard or whole- 
meal flour gave evidence that a greater amount of tryptophane 
was split off than from germ alone or fine white flour. 

Vitamines in Rice. — \\Tien young birds are fed on red or un- 
polished rice they grow normally and maintain their health; but 
if they are fed on polished or white rice, their growth ceases, they 
speedil}^ develop polyneuritis (beri-beri), and die. The insufficiency 
of white rice as a food has been studied by many men, and reports 
are numerous. Out of the many, I will mention that Kajiura, in 
connection with Rosenheim,^ worked out the proteins of rice, which 
does not appear to have been done previously. They found that 
rice completely lacks a protein soluble in alcohol, such as gliadin in 
wheat and hordein in barley. They thought this might account for 
the insufficienc}' of white rice as a food. They fed groups of birds 
on rice plus gluten, rice plus hordein, and rice plus calcium car- 
bonate and phosphate. In no case, however, did they succeed in 
appreciably delaying the death of the birds. Control birds fed on 
barley grew normally and maintained their health. These observa- 
tions showed that lack of gliadin or hordein was not sufficient to 
account for the different effects of barley and polished rice. 

Polished or white rice comprises those rices which in the process 

1 Proc. Physiol Soc., 1908, liv.; and Jojiy. Physiol.. 1908, ii. 317. 



VITA MINES IN RICE 587 

of milling have been deprived of tlieir linsk or shell, pericarp, ?ub- 
pericarpal layers, and the f^erni. After padi or red rice is hulled, 
and the husks removed by winnowing, the j^aain is passed into a 
polishing apparatus. There it is deprived of the pericarp, yellowish 
subpericarpal layers, and the germ. The end of each grain of 
polished rice shows a depression which, in the entire grain, contained 
the minute yellowish embryo. The removal of these structures 
leaves a grain composed of cells packed with starch. The substances 
removed during polishing are driven by centrifugal force through 
the meshes of a wire cloth. They form the rice-polishings, rice- 
bran, or meal. It necessarily contains the embryo, aniino-acids, 
vitamines, and other substances contained in the outer layers of 
rice. Fraser and Stanton^ proved that the deeper layers of the 
pericarp (the silxicr skin of Dutch authors) removed in polishing 
rice contain a substance or substances essential to the organism. 
Fresh polished rice is as bad as stale rice. Many observations have 
since been made on it. The essential substance is contained in an 
alcoholic extract of rice polishings, for birds and human beings 
suffering from beri-beri due to eating white rice have been cured by 
adding alcoholic extract of rice polishings to the diet. Among 
other investigators, Edie, Simpson, Moore, Evans, and Webster,- 
working in Liverpool, confirmed the discover\' that rice-bran and 
its alcoholic extracts contain substances of a protective and curative 
nature if such extracts are concentrated under a fan and not on a 
water-bath, thereby showing that the protective substances are 
destroyed by moderate heat. Casimir Funk, working at the Lister 
Institute, has done a vast amount of work in connection with the 
protective substances, and to him they owe the name of " vita- 
mines," because they are nitrogenous substances, probably amines, 
and essential to life. 

Vitamines in Maize. — Indian corn or maize is used to an enormous 
extent as a food for animals and men in various parts of the world. 
As a feeding material, howe\'er, it is considered somewhat deficient. 
It is used at many butter and cheese factories as a means of 
utilizing their waste products, buttermilk and whey, which make 
good the deficiencies. Maize contains proteins which maintain 
weight and promote growth and development, for the growth of 
animals fed on maize progresses normally, and it appears the 
effective protein is maize-glutelin. Osborne and MendeP found 
when fed on zein, the chief protein of maize, animals soon ceased to 
grow: but maize-glutelin provided a sufficiency, and animals fed 
with it developed normally. Casimir Funk* considers the pericarp 
or outer layers of maize contain vitamines. The mode of prepara- 
tion of maize-meal varies in different countries, and the manifesta- 
tions of pellagra, believed to be due to the consumption of maize as 
the principal food, vary from mild to severe. Modern milling

588 THE VITA MINES AND THE DEFICIENCY DISEASES 

deprives the maize of much salts, protein, fat, and hpoids. Maize 
has always been used largely as a human food in countries where it 
is grown, especially in America, Africa, and Ital3\ It formed a 
large part of the food of soldiers during the American Civil War, but 
there seems little evidence that pellagra occurred among them. 
This was probably due to the method of grinding it. The ancient 
method of grinding maize between stones is still prevalent in parts 
of America, and flour so prepared is preferred in the Southern 
States; it makes the most palatable bread. Such meal, having only 
the coarse bran remo\"ed, has nearly the sam.e composition as the 
entire kernel. But it requires to be used quite fresh, on account of 
its hygroscopic character and the high proportion of fat; it is very 
liable to become mouldy and rancid. These faults are remedied 
by the modem method of milling, which is as follows: " The corn 
is passed through a machine, which cracks the grain and loosens the 
germ; the germ and hull are then removed by bolting cloths and 
currents of air. The corn is aftenvards ground between corrugated 
iron rollers and bolted."^ The product is a granular meal consisting 
of 65 to 70 per cent, of the entire grain, but it has lost 75 per cent. 
of the fat, the germ, and the important substances of the peri- 
carp. 

Vitamines in Meat. — Fresh meat contains substances, besides 
protein and fat, w^hich are of importance to the animal organism; 
dried meat is deficient in those substances. It is beheved that the 
vitamines are in the plasma or muscle juice, and that they form 
the preventative and curative agents in raw meat and raw'-meat juice. 
Richet and Hericourt found the efficacv of raw-meat juice in curing 
tuberculosis lies in the muscle plasma. That it is not due to proteins 
is shown by the fact that muscle plasma contains very little nitrogen 
^— only o'4 per cent., equal to 25 grammes of protein in a kilo of 
muscle juice. Whatever the organic principle may be, it is destroyed 
by heat, for cooked meat and cooked meat-juice have none of the 
therapeutical effects of raw-meat juice. The destruction by heat 
depends on the temperature. There are some substances in cooked 
fresh meat, besides protein and fat, which make for the well-being 
of the organism, providing the heat is not excessive or the cooking 
prolonged. Various observations have shown that the vitamines 
■ are destroyed by heat of 120'' C, and the interior of a joint of meat 
weighing 5 or 6 pounds never exceeds 60° C. during ordinar}' 
cooking. Fresh meat contains vitamines which protect the body 
from scurvy and beri-beri. Grijns,- who was the first worker to 
adopt the deficiency theory of beri-beri, says the disease breaks 
out when a substance necessary for the metabolism of the nervous 
system is lacking in the food. He found similar protective sub- 
stances in meat, and showed that thev are destroyed when heated 
to 120° C. 

But it is considered that vitamines exist in properly made extracts

VIT/iMINES JN MEAT 589 

of meat. Observations have shown tliat the addition oi certain 
commercial extracts of meat to the diet ])romote growtli. Extract 
of meat is prepared by extracting minced meat with an equal weiglit 
of water, and afterwards raising the temperature slowly to 70' C, 
at which degree it is maintahied for several liours; the liquid so 
obtained is then concentrated at a low temperature. Extract of 
meat contains 10 or 12 per cent, of creatin and creatinin, besides 
leucin, tyrosin, xanthin, hypoxanthin, and adenin. Kutscher' 
more recently isolated from meat various other bodies — e.g., igno- 
tine, novaine, carnitine, oblitine, vitiatine, etc. It is a common 
experience that sailors fed a long time on dried or pickled meat, 
dried potatoes, rice, biscuit, and bread, develop scurvy and beri- 
beri, tiius pro\'ing the absence from dried foods of some substances 
essential to health; and they recover when fed with fresh meat, 
fresh vegetables, yeast, Katjan^^ idjo beans, and testicular extract, 
which contain vitamines. 

With regard to tinned foods, it has been siiown that they can 
only be sterihzed by exposure to a temperature of 120^ C. (248^^ F.) 
for not less than sixty minutes. Tliis alone would certainly destroy 
the vitamines. A failure to sterilize might also lead to destruction 
of vitamines. Perfectly fresh meat is acid; meat pickled with nmcli 
potassium nitrate is alkaline. Now, the Bacillus putrificus colt 
{B. cadaveris sporogenes, Klein) is present in the colon of animals, 
and contaminates all meat. Its spores are only killed by exposure to 
a temperature of 112" C. for fifteen minutes, US'" C. for ten minutes, 
or 117" C. for five minutes; failure to reach these temperatures in 
the interior of the tin means failure to sterilize. The bacilli are now 
given an opportunity to develop and decompose proteins and other 
organic compounds, and the sulphur from decomposed proteins 
forms sulphide of iron, which blackens the tin, while the generated 
gas may cause the tin to be " blown." 

Vitamines in Yeast. — Beri-beri was prevented and cured by 
Schaumann when he used yeast. He endeavoured to find out what 
is the protective agent. He tried nuclein and nucleic acids derived 
from yeast, but did not get satisfactory results. Eijkmann, how- 
ever, found the protective substance is something soluble in 80 per 
cent, alcohol, and Funk considers it is a \itamine, probably a 
nitrogenous substance. 

Yeast contains several vitamines. The rapidity of growth and 
multiplication of cells when yeast is placed in sugary solutions show 
that it contains a growtli vitamine, and its ability to cure beri-beri 
shows that it contains the beri-beri vitamine. Yeast is rich in 
nucleo-proteins, which yield on decomposition phosphoric acid, 
purin bases, pyrrimidine bases, and carboh}'drates of the pentose 
type. The purins are chiefly adenin, guanin, hypoxanthin, and 
xanthin. Edie, Simpson, Moore, Evans, and Webster- made an 
alcoholic yeast of extract in large quantities, and obtained a sub-

590 THE V IT AMINES AND THE DEFICIENCY DISEASES 

stance wliich was decidedly effecti\'e in pre^'enting and curing beri- 
beri. This substance on puritication yields feather}' cr}'stals, of 
which they calculated the formula. Funk^ also investigated a 
vitamine, which he obtained from yeast; he found it was separable 
into several substances possessing different melting-points and 
solubilities, but he advised the whole fraction to be used in the 
treatment of l^eri-l^cri. 

Vitamines in Vegetables. — Peasants living on potatoes, cabbage, 
and a little bacon are practically exempt from scurvy, beri-beri, 
and other diseases afflicting various people consuming a diet richer 
in the primary elements of the food. This is surprising until it is 
considered that such a diet might be richer in vitamines than that 
containing a greater abundance of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. 
It has been shown that fresh potatoes, cabbage, carrots, onions, 
various leaves — e.g., dandelion — are particularlv rich in vitamines, 
and so are some fruits, especially limes and apples. The beri-beri 
vitamine of rice is destroyed at a temperature of i20' C Cabbage 
loses its protective power when heated to no"" C, and cabbage-juice 
when it is heated to 60 ' or 70 C, and it is destroyed by keeping it 
several months. Effront found that the non-protein nitrogenous 
substances in potatoes stimulate enzyme action and cell growth. 
Potatoes are largely used by bakers to promote the growth of yeast. 
It has also been shown that drying potatoes destroys the vitamine 
which exists in those kept in the ordinary way. Hoist and Frolich 
found most of the above vegetables contain a substance which 
protects the human body from scurvy, and Funk has called this 
substance the " scurvy vitamine." With regard to potatoes, it is 
known that they contain a proportion of non-protein nitrogen, 
which includes substances possessing the power of activation. 

Vitamines and Disease. — The dietetic cachexias are — (i) Those 
following a deficiency of fresh animal and vegetable foods, such as 
scurvy, rickets, and scurvy-rickets; (2) those produced by the want 
of a deiinite principle in the pericarp of grains — e.g., beri-beri, poly- 
neuritis gallinariun. 

Scurvy. — This disease is common among explorers, in armies, and 
among sailors, when they are confined to a monotonous diet, and 
especially when it consists of dried or tinned meat, dried vegetables, 
and bread. And it is certain there is nothing like fresh meat, 
onions, and vegetables for curing it. There is probably a common 
basis of dietetic error in the causation of scurv}-, rickets, scurv}-- 
rickets (Barlow's disease), ship beri-beri, and polyneuritis galli- 
narum. The latter was discovered by Eijkmann,- a Dutch physician 
then resident in Java. He noticed that fowls develop peripheral 
neuritis when fed on white rice, pearl barley, sago, or tapioca. He 
subsequently found the disease occurred when fowls were fed on 
meat and wholemeal bread which had been cooked in an autoclave 
for two hours at 1^0" C. Red rice, whole barley, oats, and rye,

VITA MINES AND DISEASE 591 

when boiled at loo C. iu the urdiuaiy way, did not cause the 
disease. 

It is geaeiall)- admitted tiiat scurvy is due to the food, and 1 have 
elsewhere argued that it is due to tlie absence of freshness in the 
food. Wliile vegetables and meat are fresh, their salts are partly 
dissociated or ionized, and such ions are of importance for metabolic 
purposes. When foods are not fresh, when they have been dried, 
pressed, tinned, processed, autoclaved, the salts are no longer in the 
ionic condition, and are partly inert. But it has been shown that 
the substance which protects the body from scurvy is a vitaminc. 
The arguments for this are interesting. Hoist and FrdUcli' found 
that animals fed for several weeks with rye, barley, decorticated 
barley, oats, or flour of wheat, barley, oats, or rice, develop symp- 
toms like human scurvy, and die in a few weeks. The addition of 
fresh foods, especially vegetables, was sufficient to protect the 
animals from scur\y. Hoist and Frolich used fresh potatoes, apples, 
carrots, dandehon leaves, and also lime-juice. But it was found 
these foods could only protect the body when they were used quite 
fresh; their protecting power was lost when dried, processed, or 
autoclaved. This explains the reason why foods kept a long time 
in barracks and on board a ship cause scurvy. A guinea-pig fed 
with fresh potatoes alone will hve for months, but ultimately die 
without any sign of scurvy; a guinea-pig fed on potatoes which 
have been dried and subsequently boiled develops the character- 
istic signs of scurvy, and dies in a few weeks. No difference occurs 
whether the potatoes are dried in air or in vacuo. The same things 
occur when cabbage or carrots are used. 

Infantile scurvy occurs in children fed on boiled, sterilized, or 
condensed milk. The earliest description of this disease was by 
Barlow,- but its connection with condensed milk was discovered 
by Neumann,^ and confirmed by Heubner, Meyer, Brachi, Carr, 
and Bartenstein. An examination of the bones and other tissues 
led to the conclusion that infantile scurvy is identical with scurvy, 
and both are due to a deficiency of substances in the food whose 
nature is not yet fully settled. There is evidence that boiling milk 
destroys something essential for normal metabolism, and its 
destruction leads to scurvy in infants and small animals fed with 
such milk. Guinea-pigs fed with boiled milk by Bartenstein 
developed a disease which he considered identical with infantile 
scurvy. Frohch obser\'ed that guinea-pigs fed with milk heated 
to 100' C. for ten minutes and for thirty minutes, or to 112" C. for 
one hour, developed a high degree of fragility of the bones, which 
is a characteristic of scurvy. Frohch also experimented with milk 
heated to 70" C. (the temperature necessary for pasteurization), and 
found it did not cause scurvy in guinea-pigs; on the other hand, it

59-2 THE VI FAMINES AND I HE DEEICIENCY DISEASES 

prevented scurvy in guinea-pigs fed on oats, but when milk was 
heated for ten minutes at 98" C (just below boiling-point), it entirely 
lost that protective power. There is sufticient evidence to prove 
that fresh milk contains small quantities of substances which protect 
the organism from scurvy, and are otherwise necessary to the 
maintenance of health, and that such substances are destroyed 
during boiling and condensing the milk. 

The exact nature and composition of the scurvy vitamine is still 
unknown. Investigators are still at work on the subject. But it 
is well known that fresh meat, fresh milk, fresh potatoes, onions, 
caiTots, cabbage, dandelion and other leaves, apples and some other 
fruits, and especially hme- juice, are valuable curatives, as well as 
preventatives of scurvy. Schaumann considers ship beri-beri, 
which is allied to scurvy, is due to an acute deficienc}" of phosphorus 
in the organism — possibly nucleins — and tropical beri-beri is due 
to a chronic deficiency in a smaller degree; that there is a strong 
probability that scurvy is due to a similar deficiency of organic 
phosphorus; that scurvy-rickets, osteomalacia, pellagra, and other 
diseases of malnutrition owe their origin to a similar cause. There 
is, however, a vast amount of evidence to show that scurvy and its 
allies are prevented and cured b}- foods which contain vitamines. 
But the vitamines in such foods are destroyed by heat of a tempera- 
ture which varies with the kind of food. Thus it was shown cabbage 
loses its protective power when heated to no' C, and the vitamine 
in cabbage-juice is destro37ed at 60° or 70° C. Lime-juice contains 
I part of vitamine in 100,000, but it is not dgstroj-ed even b}' boiling 
it for an hour. The vitamine in milk is also fairly stable, but it is 
certainly destroyed at 120" C, or lower when it is heated a long 
time. The scurvy vitamine could not be detected in a com- 
mercial sample of dried milk, and it is probable that the 
amount of vitamine in cow's milk depends entirely on the 
quantity of vitamines in the cov/'s food and other points of 
importance. 

Beri-Beri. — This is defined by Vedder^ as "an acute or chronic 
disease characterized by changes in the nervous system, and par- 
ticularly by peripheral neuritis, resulting from faulty metabolism, 
usually seen only in persons who eat rice as a staple article of diet, 
and directly caused by the deficiency of vitamines in the food." 
Several writers prior to 1900 suggested that beri-beri was distinctly 
connected with the consumption of polished white rice. This con- 
nection was proved by Ellis, and also by Braddon,^ who found that 
when cured rice was used, beri-beri did not occur: but wiien uncured 
poHshed or white rice was used, beri-beri did occur. Rice is cured 
by soaking it fort3'-eight hours in water; it is then put into boilers 
and steamed until the outer coats burst, usually ten or twelve 
minutes. It is then dried in the sun, put through a mill, and

polislu'd in the usual way. To tost this theory dihiioro Kllis' carried 
out expi'riuu'Uts at Siii^^apore Lunatic Asyhmi, 1900 to 1908. Before 
that period 40 to 5q per cent, of the deaths per annum were chie to 
beri-beri, but in consequence of these experiments the disease now 
seldom occurs there. In 1904 ElHs fed all patients with " cured " 
rice for nine months, and no case occurred; in October he began to 
use " uncured " or ordinary polished white rice, and in December 
fifteen cases of beri-beri occurred. In 1905 he changed from cured 
to uncured rice se\'eral times, and the results contirmed the belief that 
beri-beri is due to eating uncured rice. In 1907-08 all patients 
were put on cured and uncured rice alternately for a period of four 
months alternately. It was thereby shown that beri-beri only 
occurred when uncured rice was used, and during the peri(jds when 
cured rice was used the patients tended to get well. 

There is a vast amount of evidence to connect beri-beri with the 
consumption of polished white rice. This is not all from Oriental 
countries; nor is white rice the only cause of the disease. Love- 
lace* records the prevalence of beri-beri among labourers con- 
structing a railway in Brazil. There was a case mortality of 
15 6 per cent. The diet was abundant and varied, but consisted 
chiefly of drv biscuit, dried meat, cured fish, tinned meat, tinned 
fish, beans, and macaroni. Some of the subjects of beri-beri had 
not eaten a grain of rice for man\' months. A year later the number 
of cases was trebled. In 1910 fresh meat, potatoes, and onions were 
included in the diet. The number of cases now fell off; but in 
spite of improved diet there were some cases, and the cases were 
more numerous in some camps than others. These facts show that 
a deficiency of vitamines was the cause of the disease, for it is now 
known that vitamines are destroyed by drying and canning the 
food. 

Braddon,'' who was the first to demonstrate conclusively that 
beri-beri in the East is produced by the consumption of rice from 
which the albuminous layers of the pericarj) have been removed, 
records a great reduction in the number of cases of beri-beri in the 
hospitals, prisons, and asvlums of the Malay States by the adop- 
tion of a proper diet and exclusion of polished white rice. Accord- 
ing to Braddon, there are 150,000 Tamils in British Malaya who 
never eat uncured rice, and never suffer from beri-beri. In the 
same area are a great number of Chinese who prefer uncured rice, 
because it has a pearly appearance and makes a better show; and 
97-5 per cent, of the cases of beri-beri are Chinese coolies. There is 
plenty of evidence to show that not only human beings, but io\\\s, 
pigeons, ducks, mice, rats, guinea-pigs, apes, and other animals, 
readily become ill and finally die of beri-beri when fed exclusively 
on polished white rice. Wellman, Bass, and Eustis,-* working in

594 THE VITA MINES AND THE DEFICIENCY DISEASES 

New Orleans, found polished Louisiana rice caused polyneuritis 
(beri-beri) in fowls when used as a sole food, and the same rice 
when unpolished did not cause it. The disease was caused more 
slowly by a diet of pure corn starch (maize), and more rapidly by 
pure cane-sugar than by rice. 

The main theories of the origin of beri-beri in vogue to-day are — 
(i) It is an infectious disease; and (2) it is due to a deficiency of 
some essential substance in the food. The infective theory has 
many good supporters, including Manson, Daniels, Wright, Scheube, 
Balz, Jeanselme, Le Dantec, and Marcheaux. Castellani^ says: 
" It appears more likely that a parasite will be found the spreader 
of the disease, and the actual cause will be found to be a protozoon, 
than that it is due to the diet." The occasional occurrence of beri- 
beri in epidemics favours an infectious origin. Manson believes 
the actual cause of beri-beri is a toxin produced by a living germ, 
and the medium for its culture is outside the body; that it does not 
enter with the food or water, but is conveyed to man through the 
air or his skin. Rost- believes it is due to the consumption of rice, 
and the immediate cause is a diplobacillus developed in this cereal. 
He found this organism between the starch granules of mouldy rice; 
in the blood and cerebro-spinal fluid of beri-beri patients; and a 
culture of the organisms injected into fowls caused the same symp- 
toms which they develop after eating mouldy rice. Kohlbrugge^ 
isolated from rice a micro-organism, which he called Bacillus oryzce, 
and a culture of it, when injected into fowls, caused polyneuritis in 
five days. 

Shibayama communicated to the International Medical Congress 
at London, in July, 1913, an account of the study of the disease in 
Japan. He agreed that a beri-beri-like disease is caused in fowls 
by a diet of white rice, and alcoholic extract of rice-bran cures 
them. As to the cause of this disease, the Japanese disagree. 
Most of them hold that the disease is not caused by the deficiency of 
phosphorus or phosphorus- starvation, and hold that the true cause 
is a deficiency of something else. Tsuzuki attributes the disease to 
lack of aberic acid. Others support the zymotic hypothesis. They 
believe the disease is produced by a toxin developed by fermenta- 
tion of white rice, and not from a deficiency of any kind of nutriment. 
This belief is based on experiments. Fowls which were injected 
with a fermentation product of white rice contracted a beri-beri- 
like disease. The heart of a frog immersed in this fermentation 
product of rice will stop in diastole, just as it will in the milk of a 
beri-beri woman. 

The Japanese Commission made experiments in feeding human 
beings in groups. One group was provided with " cured " rice, 
another group with rice and barle3% and a third with white rice.

Thus neither cured rice nor barley prevented the disease entirely, 
though they seem to play a part. In another instance, also, these 
foods did not hinder the onset of the disease. In a group of 100 
people fed with cured rice, 5 developed beri-beri ; in 100 fed on rice 
and barley, 4; in 100 fed on white rice, 7. 

Observations showed them that the disease never becomes 
epidemic in Japan, although a severe outbreak often occurs 
in villages, on ships, among coal-miners, fishermen, railway 
labourers, and prisoners. But they have not yet arrived at a con- 
clusion as to its real cause. 

But a careful examination of the records, of which Vedder has 
collected nearly a thousand, leads to the conclusion that the disease 
is not due to micro-organisms, but is due to a deficiency of essential 
substances in the food. This conclusion is supported by the re- 
searches of Eijkmann, Fraser and Stanton, Breaudat, Grijns, 
Schaumann, Pol, Vedder, Chamberlain, Edie and Simpson, Casimir 
Funk, Strong and Crowell, and a long list of workers, who have 
shown that a deficiency of organic phosphorus and other organic 
substances leads to a lack of vitaUty and the manifestation of 
nervous and cutaneous symptoms. 

The first authority to" adopt the deficiency theory- was Grijns,^ 
who considers beri-beri arises whenever some substance essential 
for the metabolism of the peripheral nervous system is deficient 
in the food. Schaumann- believes that the disease is due to the 
absence of certain organic phosphorus compounds in the food. 
Eijkmann' had previously shown that animals fed on white polished 
rice developed a polvneuritis, which is considered the same disease 
as human beri-beri." He also found that unpolished red rice did 
not cause it; that polished white rice plus rice polishings did not 
cause it; and an aqueous extract of rice polishings cured the disease; 
whence it was inferred that rice polishings contain a protective sub- 
stance, and further investigations showed that this protective sub- 
stance was contained in that portion of the pericarp called by the 
Dutch the " silver skin." Breaudat used rice polishings in the treat-

ment of bori-beri, and cured many people. It has been stated 
above that Braddon, Elhs, and others fovmd the use of uncured 
poHshed rice caused beri-beri; that parboiled or cured rice from the 
same sample did not cause the disease. Fraser and Stanton made 
the same observation. Moreover, it was found that when rice is 
cured prior to polishing, it is practically impossible to remove all 
the pericarp, and especially the " silver skin." Fraser and Stanton^ 
obtained analyses of different rices which caused beri-beri, and they 
concluded that the percentage proportion of phosphorus was a 
valuable indication of the effects which would follow its consump- 
tion. They found rice bran is particularly rich in phosphorus, and 
the less phosphorus the rice contained, the more it was likely to 
cause beri-beri. This will be referred to again. Strong and CrowelP 
have conducted a long series of observations on prisoners and others 
with the object of detemiining whether beri-beri is an infectious 
disease or due to deficiency of some substance in the food. Every 
precaution was taken with regard to isolation, hygiene, and con- 
tamination of the food. They concluded beri-beri is not an in- 
fectious disease; it is only produced by means of diet, owing to 
the absence of some substance or substances essential to the physio- 
logical processes of the bod\'. \Mien such substances are absent 
from the food, beri-beri results. The prevention and cure of beri- 
beri in man only requires that he shall be supplied with a liberal and 
nutritious diet suitable to the needs of the body. The disease is 
cured bv adding to the diet fresh meat, rice polishings or extract of 
the same, Katjang idjo beans {Phaseolus radiatus), yeast, and other 
foods which contain the deficient substances. 

As Grijns was the first to suggest beri-beri is a deficiency disease, 
so was he the first to suggest the deficient substance is contained in 
the pericarp, and especialh* the " silver skin" of rice. It is now 
abundantly proved that rice bran contains the protective substance; 
and that this protective material is almost, if not entirely, removed 
from ordinary white polished rice. But it is not all removed from 
rice which is " cured," and unpolished red rice, or fadi, contains the 
normal proportion. But the credit of having isolated the protective 
substance belongs to Casimir Funk, who obtained it after a long 
series of experiments. He has called this substance the " beri-beri 
vitamine." Rice contains but i part in 100,000; it is a most active 
substance, and rapidly cures beri-beri. It does not contain phos- 
phorus, but it is thought this substance is necessarv^ for the metab- 
olism of the nervous system, and has some connection with the 
brain lipoids. An examination of the brains of pigeons suffering 
from beri-beri, by Funk,^ showed that they are sensibly poorer in 
phosphorus and nitrogen than normal pigeons' brains, which sug- 
gests a degeneration of the lipoids. The same condition is found

in the brain of starved dogs. Another problem is also suggested: 
In what form is the vitamine present in tlie food ? Is it a lipoidal 
coml)i nation which is broken down by extraction from rice bran 
by alcoliol, or is it adsorbed to the lipoidal fraction ? These points 
are not settled. Funk' considers that " when the organism is 
healthy it does not matter whether it gets a fresh daily supply of 
lipoid or vitamine in the food . . . the body can use its own store. 
. . . But if there is a lack of vitamine in the body, and the organism 
is unable to synthetize it, it must get it ready-made from plants; 
and if it does not get it, deficient metabolism and death result. 
The synthetical power declines in general cachexia. The lack of 
vitamines in the food forces the animal to get this substance from 
its own tissues, and when the available stock begins to be scarce 
there is a breaking-down of nervous tissues, and the nervous 
manifestations of beri-beri result." 

The foregoing account shows that the treatment of beri-beri 
includes the prescription of wholesome food of a natural character, 
containing a well-proportioned amount of protein, fat, and carbo- 
hydrate, and the exclusion of dried, pickled, canned, processed, 
or autoclaved foods. The use of cured or parboiled rice is curative, 
as well as red rice and extract of the rice polishings. Kongo beans 
(Katjang idjo beans, Phaseolus radiatwi Linn) are vaulablc as a 
food; they contain a good proportion of the protective substances, 
and are more readily obtained than extract of rice bran. Yeast 
may be given freely. Pineapple juice is held to be of value. 
Although "the beri-beri vitamine probably differs from the scurvy 
vitamine, the use of fresh potatoes, onions, and other fresh vegetables, 
may be useful, especially in outbreaks like that in Brazil {vide 
supra). In fulminating cases of beri-beri in adults it seems desirable 
to use extract of rice polishings ; and this extract will cure the disease 
in infants, who are unable to consume the other foodstuffs, even 
when fresh milk is unobtainable. The conclusions derived from 
all the investigations of beri-beri show that beri-beri in man can 
be prevented and cured by the consumption of liberal and nutritious 
diet of the ordinary kinds planned to meet the physiological needs 
of the b()d\'. 

Pellagra! — This disease has long been associated in the minds of 
men with the consumption of Indian corn or maize. There are 
man\- theories respecting its origin, and authorities are chiefly 
divided into Zeists, or those who hold the maize theory, and 
Zymologists, or those who hold that the disease has a zymotic or 
infective cause. The various theories are briefly as follows: 

1. The Intoxication Theory.— Thsit the disease is due to the 
presence on maize of fungi which secrete toxins. Aspergillus and 
penicillium are constantly found on spoilt corn, and the supporters 
of this theorv believe their toxins cause pellagra. 

2. The Photo-Dynamic Theory. — The cutaneous manifestations 
of pellagra occur chiefly in parts of the body exposed to light. A

598 THE VITA MINES AND THE DEFICIENCY DISEASES 

similar condition, known as " fagopyrismus," also occurs in white 
or partly white animals fed on buckwheat who are exposed to 
light; they become paralyzed, and die in a short time. This sug- 
gested to Raubitschek^ that these diseases have a photo-dynamic 
origin, due to sensitization of the skin by lipoids. Maize is the 
richest of all cereals in lipoids, and Raubitschek considers that under 
the influence of sunlight a poison is developed from maize lipoids 
which affects not only the skin, but the whole organism. 

3. The Infections Theory. — A micro-organism, which they called 
Sireptohacillus pellagrcB, was isolated from the f?eces and organs 
of pellagrins by Tizzoni and Panichi,- which they found on spoilt 
corn; but cultures of this microbe only caused pellagra in guinea- 
pigs when they were fed with maize. Bass,^ of Tulane University, 
also isolated and cultivated bacteria from fseces and other excretions 
of pellagrins; fowls fed with maize on which the bacteria were 
cultivated developed definite pellagrinous symptoms. Raubitschek* 
submitted to bacteriological tests samples of sound and unsound 
maize; no micro-organisms which he found on maize, when injected 
into experimental animials, gave any results comparable with pellagra, 
and he concluded the bacterial origin of the disease was disproved. 
Sambon,^ after a careful inquiry in Italy, cam^e to the conclusion 
that pellagra is not necessarily a food disease or connected with the 
consumption of maize, and he believes it is due to protozoa trans- 
mitted to man by a biting fly, and most probably by the buffalo 
gnat, sand-ffy, or black-fly (genus SimuIidcB). The SimulidcB are 
widely distributed throughout the world; they breed in mountain 
streams and other swift-running currents, and cause great destruc- 
tion among horses, cattle, sheep, poultry, etc. This theory is now 
being investigated by many men in various parts of the world. 
According to the British Pellagra Commission, 1910, there are in 
Italy 60,000 cases of pellagra, in Roumania 50,000, and it is esti- 
mated that in the United States of America there are at least 
50,000 cases, of which 10,000 have been satisfactorily diagnosed; 
and during the last few years it has been found indigenous to the 
British Isles, more than fifty cases having come to light, where it 
was previously considered to be non-existent. 

Bearing upon this theor\' of the transmission of pellagra, the 
investigation of the distribution of the SimiilidcB in Illinois is 
important. Louis W. Sambon announced his theor\' in 1905, and 
elaborated it in the Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 
1910. In the latter j'ear the Governor of Illinois appointed a State 
Commission to inquire into the causes of pellagra in the asylums 
and other institutions of that State. Stephen A. Forbes, whose 
duty it is to investigate insects injurious or dangerous to the public

THE SIMULIVM THEORY 599 

health, made observations with regard to SimulidcB. There are 
about 500 cases of pellagra known to exist in Illinois, of whom 
63 per cent, were in the hospital for the insane at Peoria. There 
are five other asylums and one almshouse in the State, with cases 
of pellagra in each. Therefore the occurrence and abundance of 
Siniu/iimt in their neighbourhood is a matter of great importance 
in view of their probable connection with the disease. A most 
searching investigation was made. Forbes^ says there are seventy 
species of Simulium known in the world; of these fifteen are found 
in America; nine (possibly ten) have been found in Illinois. Only 
one European species, S. hirtipes, has been found in America; and 
5. fcptans, the species implicated by Sambon, does not exist in 
North America, although it is reported in Greenland. The SimtilidcB 
are all biting flies, a great nuisance and destructive pest. In 
Illinois they do not breed exclusively in swift-running streams; 
there is scarcely a small stream anywhere, including roadside 
ditches, in which Simiiliiim larvae cannot be found in spring and 
summer — in fact, Simulium is more completely and uniformly 
distributed in Illinois than Anopheles, but there is no part of the 
State permanently free from malaria, and there would be no part 
of it free from the danger of pellagra if that disease is really trans- 
mitted by Simnlidce. It is one of the main lines of Sambon's 
argument that the distribution of pellagra is limited by the dis- 
tribution of Simulium. But in Illinois Simulium is generally dis- 
tributed; pellagra, on the other hand, is distinctly local. The 
seasonal periodicity of pellagra is seen in Illinois, as elsewhere. 
Therefore, if Simulium transmits the disease, there should be a 
correspondence between the abundance of insects and the number 
of new cases of pellagia. But there is no agreement between 
seasonal variations of the disease and the insects. The actual 
number of SimulidcB on the wing is greatest in the spring; after the 
spring outburst their number diminishes rapidly, so that it is 
usually difficult to find an adult Simulium in August and Sep- 
tember even in places which they rendered uninhabitable in April 
and May. The new cases of pellagra in Illinois occurred in waves, 
and they were studied in connection with the Simulium. Forbes- 
says: " At one time I believed we might make out a relation of 
succession between the successive waves of increase in the disease 
and successive generations of Simulium, but as my data accumulate, 
this relationship becomes decidedly doubtful, and the pellagra 
periods certainly cannot be connected with any seasonal differences 
in the abundance of Simulium." Sambon endeavours to associate 
the summer and fall recrudescence of pellagra with the summer and 
fall abundance oi Simulium, which draw the hypothetical protozoon 
from the blood of pellagrins. But Forbes^ finds it impossible to 
correlate this periodicity with the facts regarding the development 
of Simulium in Illinois. Moreo\er, Sambon considers pellagra a

6oo THE V IT AMINES AND THE DEFICIENCY DISEASES 

rural disease, affecting field workers chiefly, town dwellers being 
immune; but in Illinois 96 per cent, of the patients had lived in or 
near large towns and cities. While taking a severely critical atti- 
tude towards the Simulium theory, Forbes did not consider the 
data obtained in Illinois were conclusive either for or against it. 

The Simulium theory was also strongly criticized by Beall;^ he 
investigated fifty-four cases of pellagra in Texas, and did not con- 
sider it probable that Simulidce were connected with their causation. 
As a matter of fact, only four persons afflicted by pellagra lived 
within a mile of a stream, forty-one lived more than one mile away, 
two lived eight miles, four lived ten miles, one lived twelve miles, 
and two above fifty miles, from a stream. The average distance 
of the patients from running water was four miles; in fact, he found 
pellagra was prevalent in places where the nearest running water 
is miles aw^ay, and in spite of three years' drought the number of 
cases of pellagra was markedly increased. Hunter- considered that, 
if sand-flies {Simulidcs) were the cause of pellagra, it should be 
possible to obtain experimental pellagra by using them. These 
Simulidce breed in the streams in Kansas, and have been found 
near the homes of pellagrins. He fed the flies on pellagrins, and 
then on guinea-pigs and monkeys, but only got negative results. 

Although 5. reptans does not exist in America, there are other 
biting flies and insects, and an investigation was made with regard 
to them. Jennings and King^ studied the relationship of insects 
and pellagra in Spartanburg County. They inspected the premises 
and neighbourhood of pellagrins to discover the presence, dis- 
tribution, and biolog}-, of insect groups. In some instances their 
investigation was extended to the houses of persons free from 
pellagra, for comparative purposes. It should again be pointed out 
Sanibon found the disease chiefly in field labourers. In Spartanburg 
County, Jennings and King investigated 282 cases — 75 per cent, 
were females, 173 were adults, and 82 per cent, were occupied 
chiefly in housework. They investigated ticks, lice, bed-bugs, 
cockroaches, fleas, house-flies, horse-flies, stable-flies, buffalo-gnats, 
sand-flies, and mosquitoes. They concluded that all these insects 
might be eliminated from the search except house-flies and stable- 
flies. They consider house-flies should be regarded with suspicion 
until the transmissibility of pellagra is disproved, or the nature of 
the virus and the mode of dissemination is discovered. But the 
stable-fly {Stomoxys calcitrans) is believed by them to have char- 
acteristics qualifying it for the role of transmitter of the disease. 
Its range covers that of pellagra; the seasonal activity is coincident 
with that of the disease. It bites only by day, which they consider 
accounts for the age and sex incidence of pellagra; and the highest 
percentage of reports of bites by Stomoxys was received by them 
from mill villages, where they had found the greatest proportion of 
pellagrins.

THE MAIZE THEORY 60 1 

An extensi\c> study of pellagra in tiie Southern States of America 
was made by (irimm.' Pellagra is constantly' increasing in the 
districts he visited; he found more cases of pellagra among whites 
than negroes, more among females than males, more in conditions 
of poverty tlian comfort, more in small towns and villages than in 
rural districts. The cases were grouped together, and the mortality 
was highest in negroes. The possibility of some insect playing a 
part in the dissemination of the disease is not inconsistent with his 
observations. The relationship between the food consumed and 
the disease admitted of no present conclusion. The relationship 
between pellagra and the food appears to be a real one, but whether 
the food acts merely as a predisposing cause, or whether certain 
articles of food are the real exciting cause, or only exaggerate the 
symptoms, is an open question; it is possible certain foods act in 
all three ways. 

4. The Deficiency Theory. — The theory that pellagra is associated 
with the consumption of maize has not given place to any theory 
supported b\' an equal weight of evidence. Box^ says the main 
arguments for the zeistic theory are — (i) Pellagra was recognized in 
Europe after the introduction of maize, and followed the cultivation 
of the new foodstuff; (2) it is only endemic where maize is used 
extensively as an article of food; (3) when maize is eliminated from 
the diet, pellagra diminishes or disappears. In his essay on the 
Deficiency Diseases, Casimir Funk'' says: " It is beyond doubt that 
pellagra has a close connection with maize." Reconsiders it is due 
to deficiency of vitamines in the food, that vitamines exist in the 
outer layers of maize, and the outer layers or pericarp are removed 
in milling. The peasantry of Italy live on a diet in which vitamines 
are deficient. In winter their food consists chiefly of maize-meal, 
chestnut-meal, macaroni, beans, fish, and lard; in summer, maize- 
meal (or polenta made from it) is partly replaced by bread, in which 
maize-meal preponderates. This dietary is deficient in protein. 
Observations on peasants and students were made by Rubner, and 
in each case he found the diet defective. The actual diet consumed 
by two peasants and their nitrogen balance was as follows: A con- 
sumed 1,723 grammes of polenta, soup, herring, and olive-oil; the 
nitrogen in the food was 14-8, in urine 13-0, in faeces 3-0, 
and the deficiency 3, grammes. B consumed 1,383 grammes of 
polenta, some soup, a herring, and olive-oil; the nitrogen in 
the food was ii-2, in urine 9-3, in faeces 2-5, and the deficiency 
0-6, grammes. 

The maize theory receives considerable support from a recent 
account of the results of feeding in South Africa by Nightingale.* 
Forty cases of pellagra occurred in a prison; this institution is a 
mile away from a river which is in flood for three months each year, 
sluggish for the next ^\VQ months, and reduced to pools for the

rest of the year. It is more likely to be a breeding-ground for 
malarial mosquitoes than for Simulinm reptans. The occurrence of 
the disease was distinctly associated with a diet consisting largely 
of corn-meal {mi'alic-mcal). The early gastro-intestinal symptoms 
closely resembled those of pellagra and beri-beri, and the latter 
cutaneous manifestations resembled those of pellagra. The meal 
was ground sufficiently tine for 75 per cent, of the cereal to pass 
through a twenty- to the inch bolter or sieve. The bran was fed to 
cows, and greatly increased the quantity and quality of their milk. 
After the occurrence of this outbreak the use of corn-meal was 
stopped. The diet was replaced by meat, vegetables, rice, and 
rapoko-meal. Rapoko-meal consists of the seeds of Eleusina corca- 
raiui, which is coarsely ground and used by the natives. Under 
this diet the patients improved, but when they returned to corn- 
meal (incalje-nieal) relapses occurred. The conclusion derived by 
Nightingale from his observ^ations was that zeism or pellagra arises 
from the use of maize or corn as a staple diet. 

Important commissions are now working on pellagra in Europe, 
America, and other countries. A report on the work of the Thomp- 
son-McFadden Pellagra Commission in South Carolina is given by 
Siler and Garrison.^ They found 1-42 cases of pellagra in each 
family. Corn-meal (maize) is the staple food; it formed 84 per 
cent, of the daily diet in rural cases, and 74 per cent, of the diet in 
urban cases. But they found pellagrous children who had eaten 
no corn for two 3'ears, and several adults who had eaten very little. 
The Pellagra Commission in Illinois found no marked deficiency of 
the diet in 500 cases. In one house in Peoria- lifty-six people were 
fed for a year with a diet in which corn predominated, and in another 
house fifty-six were fed on similar diet, and received no corn; but 
the number of cases of pellagra in each house were nearly equal. 

The importance of the maize theory is obvious when it is stated 
that this cereal forms the staple food of many milhons of people, 
and, it is asserted, enters into the composition of no less than 135 
food articles of commerce. Casimir Funk^ finds modern methods 
of milling alters the chemical composition and nutritive value of the 
meal. In maize, as in rice, the vitamines are chiefly in the outer 
layers, and these are removed. The mode of preparation varies in 
different countries, and the manifestations vary from mild to severe. 
It would be preferable if the whole grain were used, as in the ancient 
modes of grinding. But adequate reasons have been given for 
modern methods. When the germ and much fat is left in the meal, 
the fat goes rancid and the meal becomes unpalatable. 

The chief evidence against the maize theor\' is that pellagra occa- 
sionally afflicts people who have never eaten corn in any wa}-, and 
that people who have eaten corn and even spoilt corn for long 
periods often fail to contract the disease. During the American

THE CHEMICAL NATURE OF VITA MINES 



603 



Civil War corn-meal was one of the principal foods of the soldiers, 
and it was often spoilt; but careful inquir\- fails to show that 
pellagra was prevalent among the soldiers. Much interest was 
aroused by the discoverv that pellagra is indit(enous to Great 
Britain, and this fact, without any experimental inquiry, appears 
to prove that maize-eating cannot be the only cause of pellagra, 
seeing that this cereal is consumed very sparingly in the British 
Isles. Babcock suggests that pellagra may be due to a monotonous 
diet of any sort, especially such as is used in charity institutions. 
Whether it simply arises from malnutrition, like scurvy and beri- 
beri, remains to be shown. As regards the dietetic treatment of the 
disease, a well-balanced mixed diet of ordinary fresh foods seems to 
be all that is required. The precaution of excluding corn-meal from 
the diet of pellagrins is suggested by the observation that the disease 
is often associated with the consumption of this article of food. 

The Chemical Nature of the Vitamines. — An exhaustive 
analysis of the work of many investigators led Schaumann to the 
conclusion that tropical beri-beri, ship beri-beri, experimental beri- 
beri, scurvy, and allied diseases are due to a deficiency of organic 
phosphorus in the food. Experimental beri-beri or polyneuritis 
can be produced in fowls, pigeons, ducks, guinea-pigs, rabbits, rats, 
cats, dogs, and apes. The disease is very easily produced in pigeons 
and fowls in whom metabolism is xevy rapid; but less easily pro- 
duced in rats, especially young ones, who have a large store of 
phosphorus, and are more resistant to the disease. The disease is 
caused by consuming cereals (rice, barley, wheat, and oats), from 
which the outer layers of the grain have been removed by milling, 
flour or bread made from them, and boiled milk, tinned meat, and 
other foods Iieated to 120^ C. or more. There is a difference in the 
phosphorus content of these foods. In cereals the greater portion 
is in the outer layer: boiled milk and tinned meat have a consider- 
able part of their organic phosphorus destro\-ed. The following table 
shows the phosphorus and nitrogen in foods used in the observations 
on beri-beri by Strong and Crowell^ of the Biological Laboratory of 
the University of the Philippine Islands:

6o4 THE VITA MINES AND THE DEFICIENCY DISEASES 

Edie and Simpson^ found fresh milk contains i-o per cent. PgOg, 
skim milk 0-03, rye i-o, oatmeal 0-9, and white bread 0-2, per cent, 
of P2O5, mostly in an organic combination. 

The arguments in favour of the phosphorus deficiency theory of 
Schaumann are — (i) The fact that foods which cause beri-beri, ship 
beri-beri, scurvy, and infantile scurvv are deficient in organic 
phosphorus : and (2) the diseases are cured by foods rich in organic 
phosphorus compounds. It is probable that different groups of 
organic phosphorus compounds serve different purposes in the 
organism, and their absence leads to different diseases. Deficiency 
of one organic group may cause beri-beri in adults, deficiency of 
another group may initiate osteomalacia in pregnant women, and 
deficiency of a third group may cause rickets and infantile scurvy. 
Children fed with boiled or condensed milk develop scurvy-rickets. 
When milk is boiled, it is to some extent denatured; the organic 
compounds of phosphorus are more or less destroved. Bunge 
sa3's lecithin is destroyed at 70° C. (140° F.). Raczowski found 
25 per cent, was destroyed at 60^ C, 28 per cent, at 95° C, and 
30 per cent, at 110° C. Rickets is common in children of the poor 
in England, less common in the Highlands of Scotland and in Ireland. 
Many English children are fed on skim milk containing only 0-03 per 
cent, of P2O5 white bread containing 0-2 per cent. P2O5 and mar- 
garine. A Scotch Highland child gets oatmeal containing 0-9 per 
cent. PgOg and new milk containing i-o per cent. PgOg; and German 
children get rye bread containing i-o per cent. Pg^s- Edie and 
Simpson- found that these diseases are not cured by the addition 
to the food of carbohydrates, inorganic phosphates, egg-albumin, 
and synthetic organic phosphorus compounds, such as glycero- 
phosphates, albumin metaphosphates, etc., nor did these substances 
prevent polyneuritis in birds. But polyneuritis (beri-beri) in birds 
is prevented and cured by the addition to the diet of substances 
rich in organic phosphorus, such as rice-bran, wheat-bran, yeast, 
Katjang idjo beans, testicular extract, pancreas, etc., in such pro- 
portion as to raise the daily income of phosphorus in the food to 
the normal amount. The daily normal requirement for a man is 
2 grammes, for a dog 0-5 gramme. It was found by Eraser and 
Stanton^ that the beri-beri causing power of rice is associated with 
the removal of the phosphorus-containing substances by polishing 
the grain. They have definitely pro\ed that no rice connected with 
the outbreak of beri-beri contained more than 0-26 per cent, of PgOg, 
that rice which contained 0-37 per cent, of P2O5 did not cause beri- 
beri, and the consumption of rice containing 0-4 per cent, of PgOj 
is perfectly safe. According to Eraser and Stanton, unpolished red 
rice contains an average of 0-54 per cent, of P2O5, and Aron found 
0*557 per cent. More recent evidence is afforded by a Siamese 
Government Report on beri-beri by Highet, which -furnishes con- 
clusive evidence that the use of rice containing less than 0-4 per

cent, of P.jOs is likely to rausc beri-beri. If not milled so as to 
reduce the P2O5 below this standard, Siamese rice is a safe food. 
Acting on this finding, the Siamese Government pushed the use of 
under-milled rice in all Government institutions and the gendarmerie, 
and has practically done away with beri-beri cmiong these people, 
and an attempt is now being made to enforce its use in the army 
and navy. 

Beri-beri does not occur as a rule in those who consume cured or 
partly milled rice which yields 2-5 to 4-5 grammes of P2O5 per man 
per day. But occasionally it occurs in people whose diet contains 
enough phosphorus. This is probably due to gastro-intestinal 
catarrh. It is noteworthy that this disease sometimes reduces the 
absorption of food one-half or two-thirds. Moreover, the bacteria 
of the alimentary canal destroy organic phorphorus compounds, 
lecithin being reduced to neurin, cholin, and other substances. 
Wlien nursing-infants suffer from beri-beri, the mother's milk is 
deficient in organic phosphorus. The infant may give evidences of 
beri-beri before the mother, because the woman's organism husbands 
her store of phosphorus at the expense of the milk. 

The great importance of organic phosphorus is shown by the fact 
that half the P2O5 in milk consists of organic compounds. The 
animal organism stores phosphorus in the times of plenty to meet 
the demands in times of stress, and there is no class of materials, 
not even protein, which the organism husbands more carefully than 
its stock of organic phosphorus. The organic forms of phosphorus 
are nucleins, nucleic acids, phosphatides (lecithins), cholesterol 
(cholesterin), cerebrosides (cephalin, cerebrin), phytin in plants, 
phosphocarnic acid in meat, and other substances not yet defined. 
It has already been stated that Schaumann,^ having made an ex- 
haustive analysis of the work of many men, and in consequence of his 
own researches, concluded that beri-beri and the allied diseases are 
caused by a deficiency of these organic phosphorus compounds in 
the food. He still maintains that opinion, and it is strongly supported 
by the investigations summarized above. The power of yeast to 
cure beri-beri had been proved by many men. It is rich in organic 
phosphorus, and Schaumann endeavoured to discover which of the 
compounds had a curati\e effect. He tried the individual con- 
stituents, such as lecithin and nucleic acid, but without obtaining 
satisfactory results. It was subsequently shown by Eijkmann that 
the protective substance of yeast could be extracted by 88 per cent, 
alcohol, and such extract was curative, but its nature was not 
exactly determined. Later on Casimir F'unk- hydrolyzed pressed 
yeast with 20 per cent, sulphuric acid, and obtained a solution which 
retained the curative power of yeast, and it was a nitrogenous sub- 
stance precipitated by phosphotungstic acid. Funk obtained the 
vitamine from this precipitate, and found it was separable into 
several substances possessing different melting-points and solubilities.

6o6 THE VITA MINES AND THE DEFICIENCY DISEASES 

Edie, Simpson, Moore, and Webster^ obtained a similar substance 
from yeast, which on puriftcatiou yielded feathery crystals having 
a definite formula. 

Katjang idjo beans, which have been found so valuable in the 
treatment of beri-beri, were then submitted to an exhaustive 
examination. Pol found an aqueous extract of the beans was 
curative after a precipitate thrown down by lead acetate was 
removed, and from the remaining clear solution a crystalline sub- 
stance was obtained. Attention was then turned to rice. Polished 
rice causes beri-beri; the rice-bran or polishings cure it. The prin- 
cipal organic substance in rice-bran is phytin; it forms about 
33 per cent, of the alcoholic extract. Experiments were made with 
phytin to discover any curative effect it might possess. Aron and 
Hocson claimed very satisfactory results from its use; but Eijkmann, 
Schaumann, Cooper, and Funk did not get satisfactory results. 
Rice-bran also contains lecithin, nuclein, nucleic acids, etc., and 
Schaumann had previously experimented with these individual 
substances without getting the desired results. Ternuchi prepared 
an extract of rice-bran, removed the phytin, evaporated the solution, 
and extracted the residue again with alcohol. This latter alcoholic 
solution was curative, but it contained very little phosphorus, and it 
^was concluded that phytin neither prevented nor cured beri-beri. 
r Eijkmann made an aqueous extract of the " silver skin," which is 
richer in nitrogen than any other part of rice; and after eliminating 
phytin, this aqueous extract also contained the protective substance, 
which proved to be dialyzable and not precipitated by alcohol. 
y, Schaumann^ concluded that the protective substance is not phytin, 
but it is impossible to allow that beri-beri is due to deficiency of any 
of the primary constituents of the diet. He asserts, however, that 
the protective substances are all rich in phosphorus, although they 
have not been defined. He, like others, isolated from rice-bran 
certain curative substances which contain nitrogen, but no phos- 
phorus; he believes these substances are activators or hormones 
which produce changes in the organic constituents of the nerves. 
Funk made a systematic investigation of the components of rice- 
bran. The different fractions obtained were tested on pigeons 
suffering from beri-beri or polyneuritis, and finally he obtained the 
beri-beri vitamine. The proportion of this substance in rice is 
exceedingly small — i in 100,000, or i gramme per kilo. It is an 
organic base, precipitated by phosphotungstic acid, silver nitrate, 
and barium hydroxide. It is partly precipitated by mercuric 
chloride in alcoholic solution in the presence of cholin, and is not 
precipitated by platinum chloride in solution. It yields a cr^^stal- 
line nitrate containing Cgg.pgHg.g^Ny.gj^ per cent.^ and having the 
formula C^-HgoNgO-.* It is soluble in water, alcohol, and acidulated 
alcohol, and is destroyed by a temperature of 120° C. The dose is

very small; 40 niillit^ranimcs is suflKiciit to curi' a pif^'con of beri- 
beri polyneviritis in a very short time, often in tiiree hours; and its 
administration prevents beri-beri in pigeons and other animals. 
Funk's beri-beri vitamine has been strongly criticized, and some 
authorities consider that the" isolation and identiti cation of the active 
substance in beri-beri remains for the future," and Funk lias, in 
their opinion, " failed to isolate it in a pure state." Vedder^ 
agrees with Funk that the actual preventive substance is not a 
phosphorus compound, as thought by Schaumann; it is probably 
a base derived from nucleic acid; but he considers the exact com- 
position of that base is at present unknown, several formulae 
having been given. Probably there are several active substances 
essential to man and animals, substances required in very minute 
ytioportions, and which for want of a better term are called " vita- 
mines." Umetro, Shinamura, Tsu/.uki, and Odoke- isolated from 
rice-bran a substance they called oryzanin. They consider this 
substance is widely distributed in various foodstuffs; and whenever 
it is deficient, the diet is insufficient to support life. If it is added 
to an artificial diet of fat, protein, carbohydrate, and salts, from 
which it is absent, the diet becomes sufficient. When birds, mice, 
and other animals have become seriously ill and emaciated from 
being fed exclusively with white rice, they rapidly recover after 
the addition of oryzanin to the food. Dogs wasted rapidly when 
fed on white rice, and speedily recovered when they received 
0-3 gramme of oryzanin daily. Still working at the subject, 
Tsuzuki^ isolated from rice-bran another substance, which he called 
abericacid, of which a daily dose of 0-005 milligramme effectually pro- 
tects pigeons and other small animals, fed exclusively on white rice, 
from beri-beri. Moore* agrees with Funk that the protective sub- 
stance in the subpericarpal layers of rice is not a phospho-protein, 
he considers it a glucoside — probably a galactan. He prepared an 
alcoholic extract of rice-bran by the method described by Chamber- 
lain and Vedder; it was active in curing pigeons of polyneuritis, 
due to feeding on white rice ; it contained 4 milligrammes of nitrogen, 
but only o-i6 milligramme of V^O^ per cent.; it yielded no pentoses 
on hvdrolysis, but it yielded a reducing sugar, whence he concluded 
the protective substance is a glucoside. 

The absence of phosphorus from Funk's beri-beri vitamine is 
against Schaumann's phosphorus deficiency theory, l^ut the latter 
should not be given up v.ithout further investigation. Ship beri- 
beri is common in sailing-vessels when the men are put on bread, 
biscuit, rice, dried potatoes, and pickled meat. Pickled meat loses 
half its. organic phosphorus by the decomposing effect of the lye; 
and the other part of the diet is manifestly deficient in phosphorus.

sailors is only half the usual amount: but thev recover rapidly 
when given a diet of fresh meat, fresh vegetables, yeast, Katjang 
idjo beans, testicular extract, and other substances rich in organic 
phosphorus. 

With regard to wheat flour and bread, experiments have shown 
that small animals grow faster, bigger, and breed larger families 
with standard bread and wholemeal flour than they do when fed 
with white bread and flour. M'hite flour is deprived of the bran, 
cerealin, and germ of the grain. In the germ are lecithins, nucleins, 
nucleic acids, nucleo-proteins, and basic proteins, all rich in phos- 
phorus; aleurone contains the samie kind of bodies, but more 
phosphorized fat. The phosphorus in wheat bran was formerly 
thought to be chiefly in the form of inorganic phosphate of lime, 
magnesia, and silica. Later on it was considered to be chiefly in 
the organic phosphorus compounds. More recently it was shown 
by Patten and Hart that onlv ^^ per cent, of the phosphorus in 
bran is organized: and the chief remaining phosphorus compound is 
a magnesium-calcium-potassium salt of a phospho-organic acid — 
namely, anhydro-oxymethylene-diphosphoric acid — a substance 
which is widely distributed in the vegetable kingdom. 

The scurvy vitamine is different from the beri-beri vitamine: 
it is a crystalline substance, destroyed by a temperature of 120° C. 
or less, contained in fresh potatoes, onions, cabbage, dandelion- 
leaves, apples, lemons, limes, lime-juice, etc. It is much less stable 
than the beri-beri vitamine. Only fresh foods contain it; drying, 
canning, and processing the foods destroys it. The vitamine of 
cabbage is destroyed at no'' C. That of lime-juice is more stable; 
it is not destroyed by boiling the juice for one hour, and this, 
although the proportion is very small, afforded one of the best 
vitamines for experiments. Oats, barley, and other cereals, if 
unhusked, develop the scurvy vitamine during germination; but 
the protective power is lost when the grain is dried and again 
developed in the presence of moisture if the temperature is not too 
high. 

The vitamines of milk are destroyed by heat, but their com- 
position is unknown. Stepp found that mice fed on milk from 
which fat had been removed bv ether died after a short time, but 
the addition of the ether extract kept them alive a longtime (p. 613). 
This is the foundation of the theory that the vitamines of milk are 
associated with the butter-fat fraction. The vitamines are destroyed 
bv boiling, bv peroxide of hvdrogen, and other substances. Osborne, 
Mendel, Ferry and Wakemann^ also considered the vitamines of 
milk are to be found in the butter-fat fraction. But Osborne and 
MendeP had previously fed rats on protein-free and fat-free milk, 
and it did not cause the growth to cease; the rats grew on a diet 
completely free from fat, or which did not contain any significant 
amount of phosphatides and cerebrosides. But it has been shown 
that milk contains a growth vitamine and a scurvy vitamine. Com-

INSUFFICTESCY OF CERTAIN PROTEINS O09 

iiicii Kil dried milk yielded .1 vitainiue winch cured small animals of 
beri-beri; therefore Funk believes that milk contains several \ita- 
mines different from each other. The scurvy vitamine was not 
found in dried milk ; it is probably destroyed by concentration 
at too liigh a temperature. The cf)mposition of these substances is 
unknown, but the instability of the protecti\e substances in milk 
suggest that it should not be boiled or heated more than it can 
bear. 

It is thus shown that the question of vitamines is very far- 
reaching. It involves bread, all kinds of farinaceous foods pre- 
pared for infants and invalids, milk and all the commercial prepara- 
tions, including many infants' and invalids' foods, malt extracts 
\egetable and meat extracts, eggs, cereals, canned foods, etc. An 
authoritv, writing to rhe on the subject, says: " Suppose the recent 
contention that the growth-producing vitamine of milk is connected 
with the butter-fat fraction be correct, such a fact may have far- 
reaching and unlimited signiticance and effects, perhaps in directions 
we do not anticipate. And bearing on this point, a certain food 
is advertised to contain the vitamines of milk, but has a fat-content 
of only \ per cent. ! The food is recommended to be taken with 
cream ! ! It should be said the statement appeared before the 
investigation " (see Stepp, p. 613). 

The Insufficiency of Certain Proteins. — \\& now come to a 
different view of the cause of deficiency diseases — a view which is 
highly important and requires further elaboration. The study of 
nutrition hitherto has consisted largely of statistical accounts of 
the income and outgo of matter and energy. But the conception 
of digestion as the act of solution of the food has gi\en place to the 
knowledge that intricate chemical changes occur in the alimentary 
canal. In fact, no sooner did the isodynamical law of foods find 
general acceptance than its practical limitation becanie the sub- 
ject of inquiry. The proteins in particular have been criticized. 
The idea that all proteins have not an equal value is not a new one; 
it has long been known that gelatin is not equal to casein or albu- 
min. But the knowledge that all proteins differ only became 
recognized after a careful study of the amino-acids resulting frorn 
their hydroh'sis. It is now known that all proteins consist of 
amino-acids, many of the same acids, but they are not combined in 
the same proportions. This is clearly shown in the table on p. 610. 
The proportion of amino-acids in edestin and glutenin differs so 
much as to raise the question of their comparative nutritive value. 
Zein, hordein, and casein lack some of the amino-acids found in 
others. Indeed, it is probable that for the maintenance of growth 
and repair, and the well-being of the organism, a minimum of '^ertain 
amino-acids is requisite. This subject has been studied by Osborne, 
Mendel, and others, and has a bearing on the question of maize as 
a cause of pellagra. Until recently it has been almost impossible to 
study the food value of isolated proteins and amino-acids owing to 
the inaliilitv to obtain them in a state of purity. Moreover, feeding

IMSUFFICIEMCY OF CBRTATN PROTEINS 6ii 

with isolated foodstuti's is so costl\', and the investigations so 
hiborious, that it is only possible when supported by a wealthy 
institution, (ireat praise is due to Professors Osborne and Mendel/ 
for their researches, and the thanks of the scientiiic world arc due to 
tht: Carnegie Institution of Wasiiington, which provided the means, 

W'liite rats were fed witli artilicial food of uniform composition 
during a large span of their life; body- weight was the index of their 
nutritive condition. A distinction was made between maintenance 
and growth. A man who maintains his weight may be in e.xcellent 
condition, but a child who does likewise fails to grow. Childhood 
demands a ration which will supply material for growth as well 
as maintenance. With this proviso it was asked, Can life be 
maintained and is growth possible with a single protein in the 
dietary ? It was found that with casein, legumin, edestin, and 
gliadin, grown rats were kept alive and maintained their weight 
for long periods. But with zein, the chief protein in maize, a 
decline in the nutrition and weight of adult rats was apparent from 
the outset. Nor did the rats fare better when zein was combined 
with other proteins. 

With voung rats the effect was remarkable. With an appropriate 
mixed diet their growth was vigorous. But when fed with diets 
containing a single protein, they failed to grow, although they main- 
tained their weight and size for a long period. Here, then, is a 
distinction between maintenance and growth. The capacity for 
growth was not lost to these animals ; this was shown by the fact 
that they grew and produced young after being fed on a mixture 
containing milk-powder. Obviously, this preparation of milk- 
powder contained the necessary element to promote growth. 
Therefore they used a preparation of this milk- powder to prepare 
protein-free and fat-free milk for use in connection with isolated 
proteins. By using this protein-free milk to supply the accessory 
portions of the diet, they were able to prove that there was adequate 
growth when the sole protein consisted of casein, lactalbumin, crystal- 
lized egg-albumin, edestin from hempseed, glutenin from wheat, 
and glycinin from soy-beans. But not all proteins suffice to promote 
growth under otherwise favourable conditions. Gliadin (notably 
lacking in glvcocoll and Ivsin), and hordein, closely resembling it, 
suffice for maintenance and growth. But zein, the chief protein in 
Indian corn, which contains neither glycocoll, lysin, nor tryptophane, 
is only sufiicient for maintenance; it did not promote growth. It 
seems probable, therefore, that tryptophane is absolutely essential 
for growth, and that without it the animal organism, aithough it 
does not lose weight, ceases to grow, and probably its health suffers 
in other respects. It has been shown above that whole wheat-meal 
contains more trvptopliane than white flour, and tliat white bread 
is deficient in this amino-acid.

6i2 THE VITAMINES AXD THE DEFICIENCY DISEASES 

The R6le of the Lipoids in Metabolism. — The principal part 
of all living cells consist of proteins and lipoids. The living proto- 
plasm is not a homogeneous solution; it is a mixture of substances 
and solutions only partly miscible with each other. There is a 
semi-solid substratum of colloidal material, in addition to which are 
simpler substances, largely in an aqueous solution, but probably 
partly adsorbed to the colloidal material. It is the oxidation of 
the substances in solution rather than the colloidal material itself 
which sets free the energy manifested by the organism. But the 
colloidal material forms the conditions and supplies the enzymes 
under whose influence the energy-3'ielding oxidations and other 
metabolic processes occur. The colloidal materials are built up by 
polymerization from substances supplied to the cells — i.e., the 
amino-acids, fats, and salts in solution. Biii the lipoids are necessary 
to enable most of these substances to enter the cells. Overton main- 
tains that the outer layer of all cells consists, for the most part, 
of lipoidal substances, and that only those substances soluble in 
lipoids can enter the cell ; rather the cell wall or plasma membrane 
is only permeable by substances soluble in lipoids. The best-known 
lipoids are lecithin, cerebrin, and cholesterin. They are permeable 
with difficulty by solutions of salt, sugar, and similar substances; 
but they are easily pemieated by substances soluble in fat. The 
amino-acids are lipoid-solvents, and it is probable they only enter the 
cells through the lipoidal spaces in the outer layer or plasma mem- 
brane of the cells. Meyer says these peculiar lipoids, which intersect 
and surround the living protoplasm, so to speak, with walls of froth, 
are of decisive importance in the life and functions of the cells. 
Internally they prevent a fusion of the innumerable particles of the 
cell ; at the surface they protect it against a too rapid ingress and 
egress of water, and against invasion by salts and other substances 
dissolved in the blood and organic fluids. On the other hand, they 
form a sort of sieve for all the substances soluble in fat, and for those 
which dissoh'e in them more readily than in water. Loeb and 
Beutner^ consider that the lipoids confer on the cells the property 
of bio-electrical potentiality; and I.illie- has shown that the cells 
owe the property of irritability, or the power of responding to 
various stimuli, to the lipoids. The importance of the lipoids in 
the organic processes of the cells therefore becomes obvious. More- 
over, it accords with Schaumann's phosphorus-deficiency theory of 
beri-beri and other diseases. The lipoids consist of lecithins, cere- 
brosides, cholesterin, phytosterin, nucleins, etc. Lecithins are 
widely distributed, but occur especially in milk, egg-yolk, brain, 
liver, hsh-roc, bile, blood, yeast, wheat, maize, and beetroot. 
Their importance is shown by the fact that the growth of the brain 
in the mammalian young animal is directly proportionate with the 
amount of lecithin in its mother's milk. Cholesterin is present in 
ever\- living cell, but it is especially abundant in milk, eggs, legumes,

carrots, beetroots, cereals, and nerve tissncs. Xuclein is a generic 
name for a larj^e nmnber of organic pliospliorus compounds in 
animal and vegetable cells, particularly in nuclei. Muscular tissue 
contains allied bodies called nucleons ; phosphocarnic acid in 
muscle juice is an example. These phosphorized bodies are there- 
fore very important, and there are no substances which the organ- 
ism stores more carefully. But it is probable the higher animals 
are not endowed with the power to manufacture these organic 
phosphorus compounds, or to transform organic phosphorus com- 
pounds from one group into another group. They must be derived 
from the food. An attempt was made by Stepp^ to throw light 
on the subject; he fed mice on foods from whicli the lipoids had 
been extracted. He compared the duration of life on ordinary 
food, lipoid-free food, and lipoid-free food to which lipoids were 
added. The conclusion arrived at was that mice could not be 
kept ali\-e on lipoid-free food. It was suggested that the vital 
element was fat, and, in the case of milk, that butter- fat was the 
vital element. But Ste])p found that the addition of butter-fat to 
the lipoid-free diet did not supply the missing essential element. 
But an extract of skimmed or fat-free milk added to lipoid-free 
food restored the mice to health and vigour. Kossell showed that 
the yolk of hens' eggs contains no preformed nuclei nic acid, but is 
rich in lecithin; but after fertilization there is a rapid synthesis of 
nuclear materials at the expense of the lecithin, and it may be 
supposed, as the lecithin disappears, it is utilized in the synthesis 
of nuclein. Cholesterol is strictly conser\'ed in the organism, and 
observations were made by Gardner and Lauder- to determine 
whether it is synthetized in the organism. They experimented 
on rabbits and chickens, and concluded that the cholesterol con- 
tent of the blood of rabbits and chickens depends on the proportion 
of cholesterol in their food, and there is nothing to indicate that 
the growing organism can synthetize cholesterol. During inani- 
tion the blood of animals contains an increased amount of cholesterol, 
both free and combined, drawn from the tissues to meet the demands 
of the organism for this important substance. If, therefore, the 
organism is unable to synthetize phosphorus-containing organic 
compounds, and the organism needs a daily supply of these sub- 
stances, the food which does not contain an adequate proportion of 
lipoidal materials is deficient in important and vital constituents, 
and the organism necessarily suffers. This, however, while sup- 
porting Schaumann's phosphorus-deficiency theory, is by no means 
against the vitamine theory; for it is extremely probable that vita- 
mines can only enter the cells when adsorbed to a lipoid, or locked 
up in a lipoidal compound. 

The Role of the Inorg.\nic Salts. — Feeding experiments con- 
tinued for more than a few days demonstrate the absolute necessity 
for the inclusion of a proper proportion of salts in the daily diet.

6t4 the VIT amines AND THE DEEICIENCY DISEASES 

But the study of the use and application of salts in the body has 
only just begun. The ash of milk, meat, vegetables, and bread 
can be imitated; but observations show that artificial mixtures 
of mineral salts are very different in effect from the combinations 
prevaiHng in the foods, the blood, and tissues. Osborne^ says: 
" The balance of acid and basic groups, the changing need for 
individual elements like phosphorus, calcium, chlorine, and iron, 
furnish a series of complex variables which are probably as indis- 
pensable to certain aspects of nutrition as they are unappreciated." 
The reason why an animal cannot live on ash-free diet is not clear. 
But Loeb^ believed he found an important use for the salts. He 
says the cells of our body live longest in liquids containing mole- 
cules of salts in the follo\\ing proportion: lOO NaCl, 2-3 KCl, and 
1-5 CaClg. " The role played by these salts appears to be that of 
' tanning ' the surface film of the cells, and thus conferring on them 
the important qualities of physical durability and comparative 
impermeabihty, without which they cannot exist. "^ Thus the 
neutral salts NaCl, KCl, and CaCla are essential to the preservation 
of animal life, although they do not furnish the body with 
energy. 

It has long been a question whether living cells are permeable 
to salts in solution. Nobod}" denies that substances in solution 
diffuse into the cells more slowly than water. But Overton and 
Hoebner deny that inorganic salts can diffuse into the cells at all. 
Lillie* says each cell may be likened to a chemical factory in which 
work can only go on properh^ when diffusion through the cell wall 
is restricted, and the rate of diffusion through the cell wall (outer 
layer or plasma membrane) depends on the permeability of its 
substance. According to Overton, the substance of the outer 
layer or plasma membrane consists mainly of lipoids. Substances 
soluble in lipoids readilv pass through the lipoidal partitions of the 
outer layer or cell membrane, and therefore the cell is permeable by 
that class of materials. But it has been shown by Lilhe that this 
permeability is variable, and alterable by various substances. 
Sodium salts, though essential, are toxic to the cells; they increase 
the permeability and irritability of the outer layer or plasma mem- 
brane. Magnesium and calcium salts have the reverse effect. 
Magnesium chloride renders the plasma membrane resistant to the 
permeabihty-increasing and cytolvtic action of sodium chloride, 
and at the same time render the irritable elements resistant to 
stimulation. This alteration of the outer layer of +he cells or 
plasma-membrane by salts is produced by changing the general 
condition of the colloids forming it, or by altering the state of the 
hpoidal components. When a substance soluble in lipoids acts on 
the outer layer of the cell or plasma-membrane, or dissolves in the 
lipoids of the latter, it may profoundly change the physical proper-

ties of the membrane .ind the resjxmsixtMiess of the whole rell to 
stimulation. Chant^ing the state of the cell membrane may alter 
the whole physiological activity of the cell, and of the organ which 
such cells compose. Thus the influence of the salts is of great 
importance. Certain salts are necessary for the solution of the 
proteins; others are necessary to harden the lipoidal constituents 
of the cell membrane or the outer layer of the cell. The lipoids 
also essential to the organism are probably not vitamines, nor are 
they amino-acids, but they are essential for the admission of the 
vitamines into the interior of the rell'^.
