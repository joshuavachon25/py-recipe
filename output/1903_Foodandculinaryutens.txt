IN THE BEGINNING. 

The influence exerted by different foods over the 
physical and mental faculties of. mankind is so marked 
as to verify the famous pun of the philosophic Fuer- 
bach, "Der Mensch ist was er isst" (Man is v^hat he 
eats). The advance of civilization has always been 
accompanied by an increased knowledge of culinary 
matters, until cooking has become a science and its 
various forms great in number. So in tracing back the 
history of foods, culinary utensils and their uses, we of 
necessity trace back the history of the world. 

It is of course impossible at this late date to determine 
what was the first food of primeval man ; ignorant as 
we are of even the approximate date of his first appear- 
ance and of the manner and means of that appearance. 

But it is worthy of note that if he had not been en- 
dowed with an intelligence superior to that of the other 
inhabitants of the globe, his existence here would have 
been very brief. Nature provided him with a body 
which, in those days, was well nigh useless. His pre- 
hensile organs, his teeth, jaws, feet and nails, did not fit 
him for overcoming any of the difficulties entailed by 
the adoption of most foods prepared by nature. He 
could not tear his prey conveniently nor crack many 
nuts, nor grub roots, nor graze. His digestive viscera 
were in the middle age too bulky and heavy for the 
rapid movements of the carnivora ; they were not long 
enough to extract nourishment from raw vegetables. 
The only foods, therefore, primarily obtainable by him 
which he could use to advantage were fruits and soft- 
shelled nuts. 

As man, however, advanced in knowledge, his skill 
in the art of cooking rendered any or all objects used

for nourishment by other mammaha fit subjects of diet 
for himself. This may appear a sweeping assertion, 
but the statements of reUable travelers prove its truth. 
Ihe fact should be carefully considered by those v^ho 
advocate a diet exclusively of vegetables, and by those 
few enthusiasts who preach that man was not "intended" 
to be a cooking animal. 

Whatever else may be clouded with doubt, it is certain 
that man was so fashioned as to be compelled to eat in 
order to sustain life ! In the beginning, instinct must 
have taught him that the consumption of food was the 
sine qua non of his existence. 

When was the beginning? 

The Biblical chronology of events prior to the Deluge 
is not accepted by scientists. The students of to-day 
believe, and seek to prove, that the earth has existed for 
several million years, and has passed through many dif- 
ferent stages ; that animal life was first evolved from the 
"inanimate" state of matter ; that man is the most highly 
finished creature that has as yet been attained in the 
ascending scale of evolution, and that he will, in the 
natural course of events, make place for a still more 
nearly perfect being. 

The exact date of the first appearance of man cannot 
now be ascertained. Geological research has led to the 
assertion that he probably existed thousands of years 
before the time usually assigned. But if we commence 
our history from the last great glacial visitation we find 
that the conceded date of its occurrence, about 5,000 
years before the birth of Christ, coincides rather closely 
with the date of the creation as given in the book of 
Genesis. Assuming then that the neolithic, or stone 
age followed not only the ice visitation, but the crea- 
tion (to use a familiar phrase), the theory of many 
scientists and the story of the Bible agree on the one, to 
us, essential point — ^the birth of the first people. 

Horace, in his third satire (first book), gives his views 
of the first food of the human race. (At that time, six 
hundred years before the Christian era, it was held that 
man was not created in a perfectly developed form, but 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 5 

was engendered from beings of a different kind.) He 
says : "When first these creatures crawled out of the 
ground, dumb and foul brutes, they fought for nuts, 
first with nails and fists, then with sticks, and later with 
weapons made of metal/' This coincides with the de- 
duction made in the third paragraph, that nuts have a 
just claim to the title of one of the "first foods." 

These savages must have sufifered from exposure to 
the occasional inclemency of the weather. To protect 
themselves, they, being endowed with an ever-increasing 
power of reason, resorted to the skins of wild animals 
for covering. Failing to obtain a sufficient number from 
the carcasses of those which had died a natural death, 
they conceived the idea of destroying life in order to 
obtain the coveted article. They may not at first have 
availed themselves of anything but the outer covering, 
leaving the flesh to be eaten by other animals or birds, 
but the flesh adhering to the hide would soon become 
offensive from decomposition, and what is more prob- 
able than that their common sense soon directed them to 
remove it directly after being stripped from the slaugh- 
tered animal? The teeth of the primitive man were 
constantly in use for many purposes ; so, in tearing ofif 
the pieces of flesh with them, may the first appetite for 
meat as food have been acquired. 

It is difficult to determine when food was first sub- 
jected to the influence of heat; it is still more useless 
to attempt to explain how the properties of fire were 
first discovered. It is presumed that the first fire wit- 
nessed by man, was caused by the fall of a meteorite, 
a volcanic eruption or a lightning flash. The observa- 
tion of its peculiar effects excited the still dormant in- 
ventive spirit of the neolithic, and he essayed the pro- 
duction of it himself. Evidence proves that he first at- 
tained his end by striking pieces of flint against iron 
pyrites and letting the sparks fall upon some combustible 
material, placed accidentally or intentionally beneath. 
It is easy to imagine that it was soon learned that fire 
would destroy human life and that the pleasing odor of 
the burning flesh led to the use of cooked meat as food. 



6 Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 

The cradle of the fathers of the human race was un- 
doubtedly the southern portion of Asia. They were 
nomadic in their habits and satisfied their acquired crav- 
ings by hunting and fishing. The stone floors of the 
caves in which they made their temporary abodes were 
admirably suited to the building of their rude fires. 

Ultimately these neolithics became owners of flocks 
and herds, usually of sheep and goats, and moved about 
from place to place in search of fresh pastures. Mem- 
bers of these flocks were slain from time to time as con- 
venience dictated. When for any reason food was 
scarce, their other domestic animals, even their dogs, 
fell a prey to the insatiable appetite for blood. The 
forests abounded with living things, now generally 
classified under the title of "game," and these also con- 
tributed materially to the food supply. 

No fancy methods of preparing meats or game were 
then practiced. Everything was either roasted or cooked 
by means of hot stones. The roasting was in all prob- 
ability accomplished by suspending the whole carcass 
of the animal, denuded of the skin, over burning embers, 
composed of the limbs of trees broken up into suitable 
lengths — as indeed do the gypsies of Europe to the pres- 
ent day. The roasted meat was at first separated from 
the body by the hand, later by sharpened sticks or flint 
flakes, subsequently by flint knives. There is no evi- 
dence of any metal being used for that purpose before 
the Deluge. 

Though these first people are known to have partaken 
freely of the flesh of animals and of the fruits of trees, 
both of the nut and pulp varieties, there is nothing that 
leads one to believe that fish was used as an article of 
food until after the Deluge. 

Turning again to the Scriptures, many interesting 
things may be noted. The first mention made of a flesh 
offering and of the ownership of domestic animals is in 
Genesis, when Abel "gave of the firstlings of his flocks 
and of the fat thereof." while Cain brought "of the 
fruits of the ground." The earliest mention of cooked 
animal flesh is found in Genesis 8: 21, when Noah 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 7 

offered up "burnt offerings of every clean beast and 
every clean fowl" after the Deluge. In the story of 
the creation, man is enjoined to sustain life by vege- 
table food : "Every herb bearing seed, which is upon 
the face of all ithe earth, and every tree in which' is the 
fruit of a tree yielding seed" were given to him "for 
meat." Nothing was said about the flesh of animals. 
But, after the Flood, "God blessed Noah and his sons 
and said unto them ; * * * Every moving thing 
that liveth shall be meat for you, even as the green 
herbs have I given you all things." 

So in many ways scientists and the Bible agree on 
the habits of the neolithics. Both state that the primi- 
itive food of man consisted of nuts and fruits; both 
mention the subsquent possession of flocks and herds, 
and both refer to the knowledge obtained later of the 
effects of fire on meat — with the one difference that 
the evolutionists seek to prove that the meat so roast- 
ed was eaten, while the Biblical man prior to the 
Deluge offered it untouched to his Maker. 

Although it is now generally acknowledged that 
the Deluge was not universal, it is undeniable that it 
marked an all-important epoch, for from it may be said 
to date the recorded history of the present race of 
men. From the posterity of Noah sprang up the prin- 
cipal nations which have made the world what it is 
to-day. 

THE COMING OF THE NATIONS. 

If we accept the biblical chronology of the events 
which immediately followed the Deluge, we find that 
Noah and his three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, 
landed on Mt. Ararat and fixed their habitations in 
the plains directly below. A formal division of the 
earth into three portions was made by Noah about a 
hundred years later, when he was still in the prime of 
life and when men were beginning to multiply suffi- 
ciently to form colonies and settlements. One portion 
was assigned ito each of his sons with his posterity. 

The three territories may be roughly classed as the 



8 Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 

northern, or the region of the "ruddy men;" the 
central, the region of the "tawny men," and the south- 
ern, the region of the "blacks." 

To the offspring of Japhe.th was allotted Garbia (the 
north) — Spain, France, the countries of the Greeks, 
Sclavonians, Bulgarians and Armenians. The off- 
spring of Shem were given the central region — Pales- 
tine, Syria, Assyria, Samaria, Babel or Babylonia, and 
Hedjaz (Arabia). The sons of Ham received the 
southern division — Teman (or Idumea), Africa, Ni- 
gritia, Egypt, Nubia, Ethiopia, Scindia and India. 

Various causes scattered the posterities of the three 
brothers, and nations were founded in many parts of 
of the world. 

Ultimately six great monarchies were established, 
Chaldea, Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt. Media and Persia. 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients 



ASSYRIA AND OTHER KINGDOMS OF 
THE TAWNY MEN. 

The territories ruled by Chaldea, Assyria and Baby- 
lonia were located almost entirely on the vast plains 
of Mesopotamia. Although (or rather because) these 
nations were continually at war with one another 
they may be considered, for present purposes, as one 
country. 

Babylonia was the first to be settled, with Nimrod, 
the mighty hunter, as its monarch, about 2350 B. C. 

Although Assyria advanced rather more in civiliza- 
tion than the other two, the constant warfare waged 
and the varying degrees of supremacy and subjection 
held by the three kingdoms necessarily resulted in 
much intermingling of their inhabitants and a conse- 
quent similarity of domestic manners and customs as 
they emerged from barbarism. 

Agriculture soon became the most general industry. 
Wheat, barley, millet and sesame were largely raised. 
Other varieties of pulse and grains were plentiful also, 
as well as many excellent fruits, which have since been 
transported to our own countries with remarkable 
success. 

The dififerent grains were ground to varying degrees 
of fineness between two stones. The flour or meal 
was then moistened with water, kneaded in a dish or 
bowl, and either rolled into thin cakes or pressed by 
the hand into small balls or loaves. 

The wheaten bread was generally preferred, but the 
poorer classes were perforce content with the cakes of 
coarse millet or durrha flour, eaten with milk, butter, 
oil or the fat of animals. 

Dates formed an important article of diet amongst 
the people of Chaldea and Babylonia, although they 
do not appear to have been very favorably regarded by 
the Assyrians. Date groves flourished in many parts 
of the land, and the fruit was dried and pressed into 



lo Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 

cakes. These with goats' milk and such vegetables as 
gourds, melons and cucumbers helped nourish the 
great mass of the population. 

Other fruits, some of them found in great numbers, 
were pomegranates, grapes, citrons, pineapples, 
oranges, pears, apples and many small berries. 

Bread, wine and a kind of honey were made from the 
frjuit of the palm tree. 

King Sennacherib called Assyria "A land of corn 
and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil, 
olives and honey." 

Nature seems indeed, to have blessed her first chil- 
dren with an abundance of the good things of life! 

It does not appear that the flesh of domestic ani- 
mals was eaten to any great extent, and the inference 
is that it was beyond the means of most persons, for 
when warriors, upon an expedition, were able to ob- 
tain it at the expense of others, they freely indulged 
their appetites. After their victories they killed and 
cut up sheep and oxen, and roasted the joints over 
the embers of a wood fire. Sometimes they boiled 
the joints or the whole body in a huge pot or caldron, 
over a dead wood fire — on which, also, pieces of the 
flesh were fried. 

Amongst the upper classes mutton appears to have 
been the favorite meat. Chickens were also consid- 
ered a great delicacy. 

As the races of those days, with the exception prob- 
ably of a few people closely confined in the cities, 
were great hunters, a plen.tiful supply of game was 
usually obtainable — venison, antelopes' flesh, hares, 
partridges, etc. The flesh of the wild boar was also 
eaten, but there is no evidence to prove that the ani- 
mal was domesticated with the intention of using it 
for food. 

According to Herodotus, some of the Babyloman 
tribes ate nothing but fish, dried in the sun, pounded 
in a mortar until the fibres would pass through a fine 
cloth, and then kneaded into a sort of bread and baked. 
At first a prejudice against this species of food seems 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. ii 

to have existed, but later it was held in much esteem. 
The supply of both fresh and salt water fish was prac- 
tically unlimited. 

Locusts were also eaten with great gusto. 

The culinary arrangements and operations are not 
yet very clearly defined by the chroniclers. 

The fireplace, built presumably of well-burned 
bricks, was open at the top, about two feet in height, 
and occasionally covering an area of many square feet. 
Whether it was of square or cylindrical shape does 
not appear. Over the top was set or suspended a large 
bronze caldron. 

These caldrons were sometimes of great value. They 
were usually circular in shape, fiat or nearly flat at 
the bottom, without feet, and furnished at .the rim with 
ears or rings to receive an arched handle or a hooked 
chain. Many belonging to the wealthier classes were 
embossed with fiowers and otherwise richly orna- 
mented. They were commonly known as "seething 
pots." They varied from eighteen inches to five feet 
in height, and from two and a half to six feet in diameter. 

Roasting was perhaps the most common mode of 
preparing meat, but it was also broiled, slices being 
^.cuj: from the divided joints and transfixed with wooden 
'^gp.rts. 

For delicate operations, a fire of coal was later on 
made in a portable brazier. The oven then used was 
' cylindrical in form, much deeper than wide, and made 
of fire-burnt bricks or indurated clay. 

In the houses of the wealthy, and ,the palaces of the 
monarchs, the cooks, though usually slaves, were 
treated with much respect. They were distinguished 
by the wearing of a cap (not unlike the tiara of the 
reigning sovereign, except that it was devoid of jewels 
and unsurmounted by an apex or peak), and they had 
numerous assistants to relieve them from all the 
menial labor. 

The cook's knife, closely resembling the modern 
two-bladed dagger, was usually made of bronze, often 
thickly gilded, with a much ornamented hilt carved

from the hard black wood of .the Syrian terebinth. 
Some, however, were fashioned from bone, partly cov- 
ered with metal and adorned with pins and studs of 
gold. Others had handles of ivory carved to represent 
the foreparts of bulls and other animals, and many 
were embellished with precious stones. Quite a num- 
ber were of copper, with hollow handles. 

Among ithe kitchen utensils was a jug with a long 
neck, an angular handle, and a pointed bottom. It 
was usually suspended from a nail or hook. 

There was also a plentiful and varied supply of 
vases, large and small, pitchers for holding water and 
other liquids, bowls, cups, pans, small bottles, ladles, 
jars and funnels — some of pottery and others of 
bronze, some of simple form and others elaborately 
patterned. The funnels were generally shaped like 
the wine strainers of to-day. 

Skins were often used for holding both wine and 
water. 

The dining tables were supported by props with one 
or several feet, in the houses of the rich made often of 
ivory and carved in the form of a lion or a hero such 
as Atlas, and among the poor of stone. 

The plates and dishes were of stone, alabaster or 
bronze. The dishes were generally made with han- 
dles, either fixed or movable, by which they could be 
carried or hung on pegs when not in use, and the red 
unglazed basins bore inscriptions, in cursive char- 
acter, running round the interior in many lines to the 
bottom. 

The cups, especially those used for wine, were very 
beautiful. The lower part was often modeled in the 
form of a lion's head from which the cup itself rose 
in a graceful outward curve. Many of them were of 
gold and silver. 

To Assyria is due the birth of the "culinary art" 
and its gradual growth to a state closely bordering on 
perfection. It will be noted that it was marked also 
by the manufacture of utensils and vessels far more 
costly and elaborate than any in use at the present 
time.

EGYPT AND THE EGYPTIANS. 

The recorded history of ancient Eo-vot which was, 
according to Herodotus, known as Thebes, commences 
with the reign of Menes, or Menas, who is supposed 
to have been its first king. He ascended the throne 
about 2320 B. C. 

The growth of civiHzation among the early Egyp- 
tians was much more rapid than among the people of 
any contemporary nation. Even in the days of Abra- 
ham and Joseph they had attained to as high a degree 
of social culture as during the most glorious periods of 
their career. In art and science their advancement 
was especially marked. 

In her infancy, Egypt contented herself with the 
pursuits of agriculture, the chase, and, as the habits 
of ithe people became more settled, the rearing of 
cattle. 

The domestic oxen were usually of the hump-backed 
variety. But not only were the ordinary domestic ani- 
mals tamed and reared, but also animals such as ga- 
zelles and oryxes. 

Sheep, though, do not appear to have been generally 
eaten; in some parts it was, indeed, unlawful to de- 
vour them. 

Goats were kept, presumably for their milk, and kids 
were occasionally allowed to browse on the vines in 
order to impart to their flesh a more delicate flavor. 

Pigs were generally looked upon as unclean, and 
therefore unfit for food. The chroniclers show them 
as used for food a,t only one festival. Those repre- 
sented on the monuments were ugly in the extreme, 



14 Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 

with long legs and necks, rough hair, and a crest of 
bristles running down the back. 

Beef and goose were more generally eaten than any 
other kind of animal food. The flesh of the cow was, 
though, never consumed on account of its supposedly 
sacred character. 

The animals chiefly hunted were the gazelle, wild 
goat, auk, wild ox, stag, wild sheep, hare, porcupine 
and even the hyena. The wild boar is not represented 
on the monuments, but it probably thrived in ancient 
Egypt, for the country was admirably suited to its 
habits, as is proved by its tenancy there at the present 
date. 

In lower Egypt, people were in the habit of drying 
and salting birds of various kinds, such as geese, ,teal, 
quail, duck, and some of smaller size. 

Pigeons were also very plentiful and were much 
liked, and many of the wading tribe, as for instance the 
ardea, were so highly esteemed as to have been con- 
sidered choice ofiferings for the gods. 

The greatest favorite, however, was the Vulpanser, 
known to us as the "Egyp.tian goose," which, with 
some others of the same genus, was caught alive and 
tamed. They were also taken in a wild state to the 
poulterers' shops to be displayed for immediate sale, 
and when not so disposed of were then often salted 
and potted in earthenware jars. 

According to Diodorus, the eggs of domestic birds 
were hatched by the use of artificial heat furnished by 
manure. 

Of the wild birds, the "sic sac," a small plover, was 
often mentioned. 

The river of Egypt was noted for the excellent 
quality of its fish (eaten both fresh and salted or 
dried), many varieties of which seem to have been 
peculiar to it. "The Israelites remembered with re- 
gret the fish which they did eat in Egypt freely." 

The kinds most highly regarded were the oxyrhyn- 
chus, lepidotus and lotus. 

The oxyrhynchus is now believed to have been the 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 15 

mormyrus or the "mizdeh" of the Arabs. It has a 
smooth skin and a long nose, pointed downwards. 
In some districts it was held sacred to Athor. 

The lepido-tus may have been the salnw dentex or 
the binny (Cyprinis lepidotiis). As its name implies, 
its body was covered with long scales. Its flesh was 
excellent. 

The lotus, sacred in the region of Latopolis, is sup- 
posed by De Pauvv' to be the pcrca nilotica. 

Other varieties much liked were: The oulti, to 
modern palates the best of all ; the nefareh or Nile 
salmon, which occasionally attained the weight of one

hundred pounds; the sagbosa, a kind of herring; a 
species of mullet, the shall, shilbeh byad, kilbel bahr, 
(the Nile dogfish) a species of carp, eels, and turtles of 
the soft-shelled variety. 

Eels were, though, considered unwholesome in sum- 
mer (Ibid.). 

Crocodiles were considered sacred in the neighbor- 
hood of Lake Moeris and of Thebes, but were eaten 
by the natives of the southern frontier. 

The many restrictions imposed by religion and cus- 
tom on the diet of the early Egyptians subjected ,them 
to much ridicule from the inhabitants of contemporary 
nations, especially from the Greeks. Anaxandrides 
taunted them in his verses. 

The priests lived solely on oxen, geese, wine, bread 



l6 Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Aiicioits. 

and a few vegetables. Alutton, pork and fish were ex- 
pressly forbidden them. They were also warned to 
abstain from beans, peas, lentils, onions, garlic and 
leeks. On fast days they ate only bread and drank 
only water. 

The people of the higlier classes probably ate onlv 
two meals a day, as was the custom with the early 
Greeks and Romans. The breakfast was usually 
served at 10 or 11 a. m., and the dinner or supper in 
the evening. 

In the early ages, before men had acquired the art 
of smelting ore, many of the culinary utensils of the 
Egyptians were either of stone or earthenware. 

Knives were made of flint or stone, and were of two 
kinds, one broad and flat, the other narrow and 
pointed. 

The skins of the goat and gazelle were fashioned 
into vessels for the carrying of water, and pans, dishes 
and vases for kitchen purposes were made of a red 
ware — sometimes of a light or yellow tint, sometimes 
of a brilliant and polished appearance. 

The Egyptians were acquainted with the use of 
glass at least as early as the reign of Sesortasen II. 
(more than 3800 years ago), and made for it bottles 
and other utensils. Some of the former were made 
from two thicknesses of glass, enclosing between them 
bands of gold, alternating with a set of blue, green or 
other color. 

As the Egyptians advanced in social culture, the 
wealthier classes gave more and more attention to the 
pleasures of the table. Banquets became more gen- 
eral and increasingly more elaborate. The sums of 
money spent on some of these entertainments were 
fabulous ; they have never since been equalled in their 
costly, wasteful magnificence. 

The preparation of a big dinner was in .those days 
a weighty undertaking, for there were no big hotels 
to take the burden off the host's shoulders. Game 
had to be procured, professionals engaged, extra at- 
tendants hired, etc. 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 17 

As all .the meat used was freshly slaughtered, the 
kitchen and the butcher's department presented an 
active appearance for many hours previous to the feast. 

In slaughtering-, it was customary to take the ox or 
other animal into a courtyard near the house, tie its 
legs together and throw it to the ground, to be held in 
that position by one or more persons while the butcher 
prepared to cut its throat, as nearly as possible from 
one ear to the other, sometimes continuing the opening 
downwards along the neck, the blood being received 
in a vase or basin to be utilized later in cooking. The 
head was then taken off and the animal skinned, the 
operators beginning with the leg and neck. The first 
joint removed was the right foreleg or shoulder, the 
other parts following in succession according to con- 
venience. One of their most remarkable joints, still

seen in Egypt (although nowhere else) was cut from 
the leg and consisted of the flesh covering ,the tibia, 
whose two extremities projected slightly beyond it, 
as seen in the illustration. 

Servants carried the joints to the kitchen- on wooden 
trays. There they were washed and prepared for the 
different processes of cooking. Then the various 
cooks were kept busy scouring the utensils, attending 
to the boiling, roasting, etc., pounding spice, making 
macaroni and performing all the other details of 
kitchen work.

return for extra services, such as the holding of the 
guests' sticks, but it was occasionally eaten by the 
people of , the higher classes, the assertion of Herodotus 
to the contrary notwithstanding. 

Geese and other tame and wild fowl were served up 
entire, and fish also came to table deprived of only 
the tails and fins. 

Vegetables were cooked in enormous quantities. 

Bronze caldrons of various sizes were used for 
boiling. They were placed over the fire on metal 
stands or tripods or supported on stones. Some of 
the smaller vessels, used for stewing meats, were 
heated over pans of charcoal. They resembled almost 
exactly the nia,goor of modern Egypt. 

The mortars used for the pounding of spices were 
made of hard stone and the pestles of metal. 

Most of the bowls, ewers, jugs, buckets, basins, 
vases and ladles used in the kitchen were made of 




Slaves boiling meat and stirring fir 



bronze alloyed with tin and iron. The usual propor- 
tion of tin was 12 per cent, and iron 1 per cent., al- 
though occasionally the amount of tin was as high as 
15 (Ibid.) and as low as 6 per cent. 

Simpula, or ladles, were commonly made of bronze 
(often gilded), with ithe curved summit of the handle, 
which served to suspend the ladle at the side of the 
tureen or other vessel, terminating in the likeness of 
a goose's head (a favorite Egyptian ornament).

Small strainers or collanders of bronze were also 
used, though for kitchen purposes they were made of 
strong papyrus stalks or rushes. 

The spoons were of various forms and made from 
ivory, wood and divers metals. In some the handle 
ended in a hook, by which when required they were 
suspended on nails. The handles of others were made 
to represent men, women or animals. Many were 
ornamented with lotus flowers. 

Skins were also used for holding wine and water. 

The roasting was performed over fire burning in 
shallow pans. These were regulated by slaves, who 
raised them with pokers and blew them with bellows 
worked by the feet. 

Though the Egyptians, except when impelled by the 
desire for extravagant display, partook sparingly of 
all but on6,6r two meats, they were fond of a great 
variety of cakes and dainty confections. The more 
elaborate forms of pastry were mixed with fruits and 
spirits, and shaped to represent animals, birds and 
human beings. 

The plainer rolls were generally mixed and shaped 
by hand and sprinkled with seeds before baking. At 
other times, though, they were prepared from a thinner 
mixture, first well kneaded in a large wooden bowl 
(the feet often being used for this purpose), and then 
carried in vases to the chief pastry cook, who formed 
it into a sort of macaroni upon a metal pan over the 
fire, stirring the mixture with a wooden spatula, whilst 
an assistant stood ready with two pointed sticks to 
remove it when sufficiently cooked. 

Wine and water were placed in porous' jars and 
fanned until cool. The water was purified by the use 
of paste of almonds (as it is, indeed, at the present 
day). 

In the meantime, the reception room had been ar- 
ranged for the guests. Chairs or stools were placed 
in rows or groups, extra carpets and mats strewn 
about, flowers put in and around vases and the house 
decorated in everv other conceivable manner.

When guests began to arrive, they were first re- 
ceived in the vestibule by the attendants; who pre- 
sented them with bouquets, placed garlands of lotus 
upon their heads and sometimes collars of lotus 
around their necks. To those who had come from a 
distance, they offered water and rinsed their feet. 
They then anointed their heads with sweet-smelling 
unguents and offered them wine and other beverages. 
During these proceedings the visitors were generally 
seated on the mats. 

After having received these attentions, the ladies 
and gentlemen intermingled and passed on to the main

apartment, where the host and hostess received them 
and begged them to take their seats on the chairs and fau- 
teuils which had been arranged for them. Here more 
refreshments were handed around and more flowers 
offered, while .the guests, generally in couples, but 
sometimes in groups, conversed with one another. 
Music was next commonly introduced, sometimes ac- 
companied by dancing. The performers in both acts 
were professionals and the dancing girls nearly if not 
quite naked. Sometimes at the same party there 
would be two bands, which we may suppose played

alternately. Pet animals, such as dogs, gazelles and 
monkeys, were also often present (Ibid.). 

On some occasions the music, dancing and light 
refreshments constituted the whole of the entertain- 
ment, but more generally the proceedings described 
formed only the prelude to .the more important part 
to follow. The stone pictures show us round tables 
loaded with a great variety of delicacies, such as joints 
of meat, geese, duck and waterfowl of different kinds, 
cakes, pastry, fruits, etc., interspersed amongst the 
guests. 

These tables could be more accurately described as 
low stools supporting round trays. The stool or pillar 
was often in the shape of a man, usually a captive, 
who bore the slab on his head. The whole was made 
of stone or some hard wood. It was not often covered 
with linen, but was from time to time cleansed with a 
moist rag or cloth (Homer). 

The dishes were probably handed round by the at- 
tendants and the guests helped themselves with their 
"hands, as knives and forks were then unknown and 
the spoons that were manufactured do not seem to 
have been used for eating. The guests took as much 
as they could hold in their hands and, after eating, 
dipped them in water or wiped them in napkins which, 
it will be observed, the waiters carried. Beer and 
wine were supplied to quench the thirst. 

As individual cups were not usually seen, the wo- 
men were presented with the desired beverage in 
silver vases, and the men with it in hand goblets, 
which after being drained were returned to the at- 
tendant. Women and men both imbibed freely and 
drunkenness was a universal and fashionable habit of 
both sexes. 

When the country was in the zenith of her powder 
and magnificence, the drinking goblets were of gold, 
silver, glass, porcelain, alabaster and bronze. They 
varied also in form, some plain in appearance, others 
beautifully engraved and studded with precious stones. 
Heads of animals often adorned the handles, the eves

frequently composed of various gems. Many were 
without handles, while others were so shaped as to 
more properly come under the name of beakers and 
saucers. The beakers were frequently made of ala- 
baster with a round base, which prevented their main- 
taining an upright position without additional support; 
and when empty they were turned downwards upon 
their rims. The saucers, which were of glazed pottery, 
were ornamented with lotus and fish carved or molded 
on itheir concave surface. 

Many of the vases have never yet been surpassed in 
daintiness of ornamentation. The most remarkable 
were those fashioned from porcelain which was made 
of a fine sand or grit, loosely fused and covered with a 
thick silicious glaze of a blue, green, white, purple 
or yellow color. The blue tints obtained have never 
been equalled in modern times. 

Herodotus tells us ,that, after the heavier part of a 
banquet, it was the custom to have a man carry round 
a coffin containing a wooden image in exact imitation 
of a corpse. Showing this to each of the revelers, the 
bearer would say: "Look upon this and then drink 
and enjoy yourself, for when dead you will be like unto 
this." A rather weird observance, which might be 
traced back to the death of Osiris. 

If the phrases are corectly reported, we must sup- 
pose the figure, brought in after the eating was ended 
and when the drinking began, was for ,the purpose of 
stimulating the guests to still greater conviviality. 
But if that were the case when Herodotus visited 
Egypt it musit have been originated with a very dif- 
ferent intention. The Egyptians were too much in- 
clined to excesses in eating and drinking, both men 
and women (Herodotus and Plutarch), and the priests 
probably endeavored to thus check their ,too riotous 
mirth without personally interfering. Plutarch said 
concerning it : 

"The skeleton which the Egyptians appropriately 
introduce at their banquets, exhorting the guests to 
remember that they shall soon be like him, though he 



24 Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 

comes as an unwelcome and unseasonable boon com- 
panion, is nevertheless in a certain degree seasonable, 
if he exhorts them not to drink too deeply or indulge 
only in pleasures, but to cultivate mutual friendship 
and affection and not to render life, which is short in 
duration, long by evil deeds." 

After the skeleton, there was sung a doleful song in 
honor of Maneros, whose identity is clouded by tra- 
ditional disputes. 

Next, music and songs of more mirthful character 
were resumed. Sometimes jugglers, male and female, 
were hired for the occasion. They amused their audi- 
ence with ball tossing, turning somersaults, leaping 
and wrestling. Occasionally, games, resembling our 
draughts or checkers, served to amuse those present 
(Ibid.), but as a rule the fumes of wine prevented any 
such quiet occupation, and ,the festival in many cases 
ended with a most riotous carousal. 

The foregoing is probably a true picture of a banquet 
in ancient Egypt — except that, according to some 
writers, the diners were seated on ,the fioor and ate 
from very low stools or tables. 

Yet, in spite of all, the moral code of the early 
Egyptians was purer than that of contemporary na- 
tions. And commerce and war carried abroad the ad- 
vanced thoughts, great learning and luxurious tastes 
of these ancient people, to be the foundations in after 
years of divers civilizations, amongst them our own.

THE "VEGETABLE KINGDOM" OF AN- 
CIENT EGYPT. 

The vegetable kingdom of ancient Egypt may be 
roughly divided into four great classes — trees and 
shrubs, esculent plants, grains and artificial grasses. 

Of the first named, the most important food pro- 
viding trees were the doom and date palms, the syca- 
more, tamarisk and mokhayp or myxa. 

The doom palm (Cucifera Thebaica) grows abund- 
antly throughout all upper Egypt. It is a very pic- 
turesque tree which, unlike its date-bearing sister, 
spreads out into numerous limbs or branches, reaching 
an elevation of about thirty feet. Its wood is more 
solid than that of the date tree, and was found to be 
very serviceable for the building of boats, etc. 

The blossoms are of two kinds, male and female. 
The fruit, which is developed from the female blos- 
som, grows in large clusters, each fruit attaining the 
size of a goose's egg, although the nut within the 
fibrous external envelope is not much bigger than a 
large almond. The flavor of .the nut is peculiarly 
sweet, resembling our' ginger bread. It was eaten both 
in a ripe and unripe condition — in the latter it has 
about the texture of cartilage; in the former it is 
harder, and has been compared to the edible portion of 
the cocoanut. 

The date palm is too well known to need any gen- 
eral description. Two kinds, however, flourished — the 
wild and the cultivated. The wild variety grew from 
seeds, and often bore an enormous quantity of fruit. 
Sir G. Wilkinson is authority for the statement that 
a single bunch has been known to contain between 



26 Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 

6,000 and 7,000 dates, and as it is a common thing for 
a tree to bear from five to twenty-two bunches, the 
average total is often from 30,000 ito 100,000 dates per 
tree. The fruit is, though, small and of poor quality, 
and consequently it is not often gathered. 

The cultivated variety was grown from ofif-shoots 
selected with care, planted out at regular intervals and 
abundantly irrigated (Ibid.). It began to bear in five 
or six years and continued productive for sixty or 
seventy. 

Besides the amount of nourishing food furnished and 
the value of the wood of the date palm, an exhilarating 
drink was made from its sap and brandy or loivhgeh, 
date wine and vinegar from the fruit without much 
difiliculty. 

The fruit of the sycamore (Ficus sycamorus) ripens 
in June. Although it was much esteemed by the 
ancients, it has been denounced by moderns as insipid. 

The mokhayt (Cardia niyxa) grows to the height of 
about thirty feet, commencing to branch out at a 
distance of twelve feet from the ground, with a diame- 
ter at ,the base of about three feet. Its fruit is of a 
pale yellow color, inclosed in two skins. Its texture is 
viscous and its taste not very agreeable. It was used 
extensively as a medicine, and was also, according to 
Pliny, made into a fermented liquor ("Ex myxis in 
Aegypto Cit vina fiunt"). 

Among other fruit trees and shrubs may be men- 
tioned the fig, pomegranate, vine, olive, peach, pear, 
plum, apple, carob or locust (Ceratonia siliqua), persea, 
palma, christi or castor oil plant, nebk (Rhamnus Na- 
beca), and the prickly pear or shok. 

The persea (Balanite Aegyptiaca) is a bushy tree 
or shrulj which under favorable circumstances reaches 
an altitude of eighteen or twenty feet. Its bark is of 
whitish color, its branches gracefully curved, its foli- 
age of an ashy gray hue. Its lower branches are sup- 
plied with long thorns ; on its upper branches grows 
the fruit, which resembles a small date in general 
character. Its exterior consists of a pulpy substance of 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 27 

subacid flavor; its stone is large for the size of the 
fruit, and incloses a kernel of yellowish-white color 
and an oily, ra,ther bitter flavor. Both the exterior and 
the kernel were eaten. 

The nebk or sidr is another fruit of the date variety. 
It was eaten raw, or the flesh, detached from the 
stone, was dried in the sun. It enjoyed the reputation 
of being a sustaining as well as agreeable article. 

The most common fig was that known to the 
Romans as "cottana," and by the modern Arabs as 
"qottaya." 

The olives grown were large and fleshy, but con- 
tained little oil. 

Vines were undoubtedly much cultivated, in spite 
of the assertion of Herodotus to the contrary. The 
bunches of grapes, when intended for immediate con- 
sumption, were, after being gathered, placed in flat 
open baskets. When intended for the wine press they 
were closely packed in deep baskets or hampers, which 
were carried to the shed or storehouse on men's heads 
or by means of shoulder yokes. The juice was ex- 
tracted by treading or squeezing in a bag. 

The juice of the grape was sometimes drunk in its 
fresh condition (Genesis), but fermentation was usu- 
ally awaited, and the wine was then stored away in 
vases or amphorae of elegant shape, closed with stop- 
pers and hermetically sealed with moist clay, pitch, 
gypsum or other similar substances. 

The best brands came from Anthylla (Athenaeus), 
Maresitis (Pliny and Strabo), and the tract about Lake 
Marea. Sebennytic, Thebaid and Coptos also pro- 
duced light, wholesome wines. 

The esculent plants consisted of both wild and culti- 
vated varieties. Those most in demand were the 
byblus or papyrus, the Nymphaea lotus, lotus coeru- 
lea and the Nymphaea nelumbo (called by Pliny "col- 
ocasia" and also "cyamon"). 

The papyrus grew luxuriantly in ancient Egypt, es- 
pecially in the marshy districts of the Delta, although 
it is no longer found in the country. The pith of the 



28 Foods and Culmary Utensils of the Ancients. 

upper and middle portions of the tall, smooth, tri- 
angular-shaped reed was used for paper, but that of 
the lower portion and the root were regarded as an 
edible delicacy. According to Herodotus, it was pre- 
pared for the table by being baked in a closed vessel. 

The Nymphaea lotus, which resembles our white 
water lily, was also a product of the lowlands. The 
seed vessels were collected and dried, to be afterward 
crushed and made into cakes. The rest of the plant 
was also eaten cooked or raw, and was said to be of a 
"pleasant sweet taste," but nineteenth century palates 
declare it to be no better than a bad truffle. The lo,tus 
coerulea was merely another variety of the same plant. 

The Nymphaea nelumbo, which is, by the way, no 
longer found in Africa, was called by the Greeks and 
Romans the "Egyptian bean," and was regarded by 
those races as emblematic of Egypt. It did not differ 
from the ordinary lotus except in the large dimensions 
of the leaves and the size and loveliness of its blos- 
soms. The leaf of the flower varied from one to one 
and a half feet in diameter. It had two rows of petals 
six inches in length, of a crimson or rose-colored 
purple, and inside of these was a dense fringe of 
stamens surrounding and protecting the ovary. The 
fruit developed into a sweet, wholesome nut or al- 
mond, divided into two lobes by a bitter green leaf 
or corculum (removed before eating), with a shell 
shaped like the rose of a watering po,t and studded 
with seeds (about the size of small acorns and to the 
number of twenty or thirty), which projected from 
the upper surface in a circle about three inches in 
diameter. Both ,the nuts and roots were eaten by the 
poorer classes. 

Wheat and barley were grown in all the provinces 
in the valley of the Nile, as were also, though to a 
lesser extent, rice, millet, pulse, peas, beans, lentils, 
hommos {Cicer arietinum), gilban (Lafhynts sativHs), 
carthamus, lupins, bamia. jigl (Raphainis safniis— 
Linn., Herodo,t., Pliny), simsin, indigo. _ cassia, 
senna, colocynth, cummin (the seeds of which were

used for bread), durrha, coriander, cucurbitae, onions, 
cucumbers, leeks, etc. 

The onions were mild and of an excellent flavor. 
Nicerates quotes Homer as authority for the statement 
that they were much relished when eaten with wine. 

According to Diodorus, children and even some 
grown persons lived at that time solely on roots and 
esculent herbs, eating them both raw and cooked. 

The bread or cake used in the homes of the wealthy 
Was made from wheaten flour; those one degree lower 
in the social scale made use of barley meal, and the 
poorer classes ate bread of the durrha (Holcus sorghum) 
flour.

GREECE BEFORE THE AGE OF LUXURY. 

It is impossible within these pages to tabulate with 
absolute correctness any hard and fast menu as the 
diet of the ancient Greeks, as it varied greatly accord- 
ing to the products of the several parts of the diversi- 
fied country over which they ruled, but one can by the 
process of elimination arrive at fairly satisfactory 
generalities. 

The principal food of the poorer classes was bread. 
It was not a very appetizing kind, however, as it usu- 
ally consisted of a simple dough of barley meal moist- 
ened with water, or, occasionally, poor wine. It was 
eaten without cooking or any further preparation. 
This was the universal food of the Spartans. 

The middle and wealthy classes partook, though, of 
baked wheaten bread, which was called by Homer 
"the strength of life." 

All other kinds of food, with the exception of sweet 
cakes, cheese and a few vegetables and fruits, were at 
first considered (save by the inhabitants of the cities) 
as luxuries — somewhat as even now amongst old-fash- 
ioned people in Scotland, the term "kitchen" is applied 
to all edible articles other than dry bread. 

Of sweet cakes there were many kinds. They were 
flavored with various seeds and sweetened with honey. 
Sugar, though, if known at all, was used only for its 
medicinal properties. 

Cheese was eaten mixed with wine or honey and 
salt. 

Dried figs and grapes were much liked, especially 
by the Athenians, and olives were even then pickled 
for a relish. 

The vegetables that were formerly cultivated are 
not easily distinguished by the names applied to them 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 31 

by different writers, but it is certain that lettuce, cab- 
bage, peas, beans, vetches, leeks, onions, parsley and 
thyme were grown, as well as truffles and mushrooms. 
Vegetables were eaten in the form of soup, served on 
lio,t dishes with sauce or dressed as salad. 

In the numerous towns large quantities of fish were 
sold. The salt water were more generally preferred 
than the fresh water varieties, although especial favor 
was bestowed on the eels that were obtained from Lake 
Copais in Boeotia. There grew up early in history 
a heavy trade in fish from the Black Sea and even from 
the coasts of Spain. 

Although frequent mention is made of fish, cheese 
and vegetable markets, a meat market seems to have 
been almost unknown. From this and also from the 
fact ,that the word which designated butchers' meat 
also signified "victim," it may be concluded that oxen 
were primarily slaughtered only at sacrificial feasts. 

The flesh of the hare was more highly esteemed than 
that of any other kind of four-footed game. Of wild 
birds the thrush was most relished. 

Pheasants and woodcock were plentiful, and quails 
were made to act as combatants for the edification of 
the Grecian youth. 

Domestic fowls and eggs were common. 

Butter was seldom made, as it was considered un- 
wholesome, olive oil (as at ,the present time) being 
used in its place. 

Although the Greeks were fond of water as a bever- 
age, the difficulty of obtaining it of good quality, com- 
bined with the tremendous production of wine, made 
the latter the national drink. It was, however, seldom 
drank in an undiluted condition, and the Northerners, 
who were in the habit of drinking it neat, were de- 
nounced as unappreciative barbarians. But this is not 
very strange, as the large amount of fir resin which 
is still added to most Greek wines, makes them too 
strong and bitter for the civilized palate to drink un- 
less tempered by water. 

The first juice extracted from the press before tread- 



32 Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 

ing was set apart as choice wine, the pressed grapes 
being then used for the making of the commoner va- 
riety or vinegar. 

The wine was often boiled and mixed with salt for 
exportation, and aromatic herbs and berries were add- 
ed to impart different flavors. It was then placed in 
earthenware jars sealed with pitch. 

The various kinds may be roughly classed by colors. 
The black was the strongest and sweetest ; the white 
was the weakest, and that of golden color was dry 
and very fine in flavor. 

The wines grown in ,the districts of Lesbos, Chios,. 
Sikyon, and Phlios were the most esteemed. Age was 
considered when estimating the value of wine, but the 
preference for any special year of vintage seems tO' 
have been unknown. 

Even in those early days epicures whenever possible 
cooled their jars with snow before pouring out the 
wine. ' 

Cow's milk was not liked, but the first milk of goats 
and sheep was often drank, although more generally 
used for the manufacture of cheese. 

The morning meal seldom consisted of more than 
bread dipped in wine and water, resembling closely the 
morning coffee of the Continent. The principal meal 
of the very early Grecians, as in the case of nearly all 
young nations, was served about noon, but as civiliza- 
tion advanced, the hour grew later, until 5 o'clock be- 
came most popular, a light luncheon then being served' 
in the middle of the day. 

Although Homer represents his chiefs as being al- 
ways ready to sit down and gorge themselves with 
meat, the Grecian gentleman was not a disciple of 
"high living" or indolence. He desired and appreciated 
the charm of sober conversation and intellectual stim- 
ulus. Homer recognized .this when he said, "Nor did 
the mind of any stand in want of an equal feast." 

The social instincts and the warmth of feeling 
amongst the Hellenic race made dinners and festival 
events of every day occurrence, and caused them to 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 3,3 

fill a prominent part in the lives of all, but the diet of 
the Homeric age was wonderfully simple (in those 
early days the most elaborate dinners consisted of only 
two courses — the first of meat, usually roasted sheep, 
oxen or pigs, and vegetables ; the second of cakes, 
sweetened with the honey of Hymettus, and dried and 
fresh fruits), for appetites were held subordinate to 
the love of music and the dance. 

" * * * Nor can I deem 
Aught more delightful than the general joy ^ 

Of a whole people, when the assembled guests, 
Seated in order in the royal hall, 
Are listening to the minstrel, while the board 
Is spread with bread and meats, and from the jars 
The cup-bearer draws wine and fills the cups. 
To me there is no more delightful sight." 

(Plato.) 

Invitations were generally given a few days in ad- 
vance by the host in person in the market or any other 
place of common sojourn. 

Unlike the Egyptians, the Grecians made their 
toilets and anointed themselves before arriving at their 
host's house. 

But before eating, 

" * * * In a bowl 
Of silver, from a shapely ewer of gold, 
A maid poured water o'er the hands and set 
A polished table near them." 

Then, if any had traveled from a distance, their feet 
were bathed in perfumed water and wine. 

Meanwhile the male attendants w^ere not idle — 

"* * * "Some in the bowls 

Tempered the wine with water, some cleansed 

The table with light sponges and set 

The banquet forth and carved the meats for all." 

A separate table was in those days usually provided 
for each guest, though the rule was not strictly ob- 
served. 

In some cases, diners-out were accompanied and at- 
tended by their own servants. In a few districts in 
modern Greece this is still habitual. 

Chairs and stools were generally used as seats, the 



34 Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 

custom of reclining on couches not being introduced 
until a later date. 

As napkins were then unknown, the guests wiped 
their fingers on towels and in pieces of specially pre- 
pared dough, which were thrown under the table after 
being used. 

There were spoons (of metal, often of gold — Athe- 
naeus), but hollow pieces of bread were generally used 
in their stead. 

The carver presided at a table and cut the meats 
into small pieces, as individual forks and knives were 
then unknown. The portions were usually of uniform 
size, although any very honored person was presented 
with larger or choicer morsels. 

The diluted wine was then transferred by ladles 
to the drinking cups or beakers, to be distributed by 
boy servants. The first cup was handed from one to 
another of the guests untouched as a sort of salu- 
tation. 

It was not customary to drink before the meal had 
been served. 

Bread was handed round in little baskets woven 
from slips of ivory. 

Moderation was universally observed. It was deemed 
gluttonous to linger long over a repast, and contemptible 
to imbibe too freely of wine.

And hunger were appeased, the diners thought

But here again all ribaldry was debarred. Tender 
hymns and rhapsodies were sung to the accompani- 
ment of the harp by .trained singers, who were seated 
at special tables on silver-mounted thrones. 

Games of various kinds usually followed, and with 
conversation filled out the time until the gathering dis- 
persed. 

House picnics were much in vogue :

And strengthening wine they came. Their wives, who on their 

brows 
Wore snowy fillets, brought the bread, and thus 
Within the halls of Menelaus all 
Was bustle setting forth the evening meal." 

Among the dining- room utensils should be men- 
tioned the various baskets of copper, silver, gold and 
ivory wire ; vessels for mixing wine, usually of silver, 
but sometimes of the more precious metal, and cups of 
elaborate design and costly workmanship. 

The cups were of various shapes and sizes. The 
"depas" had two handles and was made of wood, 
thickly covered with gold studs. Another, the "ky- 
pellon," was broad and shallow, made of various 







Drinking vessels: Bowls, beakers and rhyta. 



metals, usually gold. The "phiate" was very similar 
in appearance to the kypellon. The "kotyle" was so 
small as to merely hold "a scanty draught, which only 
wet the lips, but not the palate." 

The "sykphos" and "kissybion" were simple wooden 
cups in use amongst the peasantry. They were usually 
made of the wood of the cypress. 

Skilled cooks were seldom regularly employed on the 
domestic staff. They usually congregated in the market 
places and when any particular occasion necessitated 
their services they were hired by the day. As also now- 
adays they generally represented several nations, and

they gained in social importance as the love of luxury 
gradually overcame the custom of simple fare. 

The regular staff of household servants, slaves in 
fact, were under the management of a general stew- 
ard, himself a slave, who attended personally to the 




Wine jugs or 



buying and superintended the details of all the other 
departments. 

But besides these private dinners, occasion often 
brought about banque.ts on a much larger scale, some- 
times in honor of religion or of death. 
" * * * There upon the ocean's side 
They found the people offering coal black steers 
To dark haired Neptune. On nine seats they sat. 
Five hundred on each seat; nine steers were slain 
For each five hundred there." 
There was also a great difference between the foods 
of the ordinary people and that of the heroes described 
in the classics. According to Homer, who was probably 
guilty of exaggeration, the athletes consumed enormous 
quantities of various meats (roasted or broiled, by the 
way — never boiled), which comprised their entire diet 
with the exception of wine and bread. Beef, mutton, 
venison, and especially pork, were mentioned. 

"He spake and girt his tunic round his loins

And hastened to the sties in which the herds 

Of swine were lying. Thence he took out two 

And slaughtered them and scraped them, sliced the flesh 

And fried it upon spits and when the whole 

Was roasted, brought and placed it reeking hot,

Fish and cheese were only considered worthy of the 
athletic when animal flesh was scarce. Nor were these 
giants possessed of very fastidious palates.

The hospitality of the early Grecians was unbounded. 
.The high moral and social standard of the masses of 
the people rendered it possible to extend greater courtesy 
towards strangers than would have been deemed pru- 
dent in later days. Every stranger or traveller who 
knocked at the door of a residence was sure of a wel- 
come. No questions were asked him until he had been 
generously entertained in every feasible manner, for he 
stood under the protection of Zeus Xenios, guardian of 
the guest. 

This lavish friendliness was probably caused by, or 
was perhaps itself the cause of, the scarcity of hostelries 
of reputable character. A spirit of compassion also ex- 
isted, as it was then considered an ill fortune that made 
one journey far from home. 

As the centuries of increasing wealth and power re- 
laxed the rigidity of the morals of these ancient in- 
habitants of Greece, the love of luxury gradually sup- 
planted the absorbing desire for intellectual enjoyment 
which had at first raised them so far above the people 
of the neighboring territories. Gluttonous devotion to 
the table, in conjunction with numerous vices, under- 
mined the physical as well as the moral constitution.

and the country which had astounded the ages with the 
valor of its sons, which had proved invulnerable to 
numerous martial forces, succumbed to the influence 
of sensual tastes and passions, suggested by the idleness 
of worldly success. And as their worship of their 
palates grew, the trained cook obtained an even greater 
influence until his position became one of extreme im- 
portance, and was so recorded by the poets and drama- 
tists of the time. 

Little difl^erence, in fact, was there between the habits 
of the latter day Greeks and the Romans in the days of 
their great wealth, for Grecian luxuries and Grecian 
habits were the models that Rome took as its models, 
so we will pass on to the next chapter, inferentially 
describing the former while depicting the latter.

ROME IN THE DAYS OF HER GREATEST 
PROSPERITY. 

The food of the early Romans resembled to a great 
extent that of the Greek heroes (their national dish was 
pulmentarium, a porridge made of pulse), but to avoid 
repetitions we will pass over the first centuries of Ro- 
man history, choosing as our subject Rome in the days 
of prosperity. 

It should, however, be mentioned that Greece never 
attained such enormous wealth as Rome, and that even 
in her greatest recklessness she was more refined. 
Goethe said that in the days of their highest civilization 
the Romans remained parvenus ; that they did not know 
how to live, that they wasted their riches in tasteless 
extravagance and vulgar ostentation — ^but it must be 
remembered that, whereas the civilization of the nine- 
teenth century is industrial, that of Rome was militant, 
and to that should be attributed the fact that some of 
the simplest means of comfort were then unknown. 

Many moderns are inclined to doubt the assertions 
made concerning the countless riches and marvellous 
expenditures of those days. They read with skepticism 
the writings of Juvenal, Seneca and the elder Pliny. 
But, though in some cases exaggeration was doubtless 
resorted to. sufficient proof remains to convince the 
observing mind that the wealth of the Roman far sur- 
passed the wildest dreams of the richest man of the 
present day. The ruins of the Colosseum and of the 
baths of Caracalla, two structures raised solely for 
pleasure, impress us with their stupendous magnificence, 
and even the twentieth century has failed to equal the 
palaces of the nobles. 

Moreover, it must be remembered that the wealthy 
Roman owned many mansions. Each of the larger ones

was a miniature city, sheltering a small army of slaves. 
The buildings were surrounded by parks, vineyards, 
woods and artificial lakes. The atria and peristyles were 
embellished with valuable paintings and statues. The 
walls and ceilings of the chambers were decorated with 
gold and precious stones. Nowhere else, recorded in the 
history of the world, with the possible exception of the 
palaces of the Incas, has gold ever been so lavishly used. 
On the furniture and ornaments alone, millions were 
expended. A single cup of murra brought 1,000,000 
sesterces ($40,000). A small citrus wood table cost a 
similar sum — yet Seneca owned 500 of them, an outlav 
on that class of furniture alone of $20,000,000. 

All Italy was covered with the country residences of 
the patricians. They were found in numbers on the 
coast of Campania, the Sabine hills and the lakes of the 
North. 

The most esteemed members of the household staff 
were the coqui (cooks) and the pistores (fancy bakers). 
They often amassed large fortunes from their salaries 
and the many presents they received. All the other ser- 
vants (who were usually slaves) were under the juris- 
diction of a headman, an atrieiisis. 

The first meal (ientacnluin) was light, consisting or- 
dinarily of bread and wine with honey, dates, olives or 
cheese. At the prandium (their dejeuner a la fouj-chette, 
which took the place of their noon dinner of former 
days), meats, vegetables, fruits, bread and wine were 
provided. After the second meal, the meridiato (or in 
modern language, the siesta) was enjoyed, as it is in 
the Italy of this century — although, unlike the sleepy 
town we know, business Rome then never slept. 

After the short midday rest came games and exer- 
cises. The youth betook themselves to Campus Martins. 
The older members of the family made use of the 
sphaeristerium, a private gymnasium and ball room, 
which was found in every house. With it were con- 
nected the private baths. 

The cena, the principal meal, commenced at 3, 4 or 5 
o'clock in the afternoon. Seldom less than four hours 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 41 

were spent at table. Pliny, the elder, who was consid- 
ered a very abstemious man, sat down to his meal at 
4 o'clock, and remained there "until it began to grow 
dark in summer and soon after night in winter," at least 
three hours. The amount of food consumed would be 
incredible were it not for the explanation recorded by 
Seneca, "Edunt ut vomant; vomant ut edunt."

The "gustus," or appetizer, was also variously known 
as the "gustatio." A favorite drink served with it was 
a mulsum of Hymetian honey and Falernian wine. 

Toothpicks made from the leaves of the mastich pis- 
tachio were in common use. 
. All the dishes were carved at the sideboards by expert 
carvers who were trained in schools by practice on 
jointed wooden models.

let of ordinary size was cheap — one that was rather 
heavy easily brought 6,000 sesterces ($240.00). 

In order to lengthen the time, jugglers, rope-dancers, 
buffoons and actors were introduced between courses. 
Beautiful Andalusian girls charmed the dinners with

their voluptuous dances. Even gladiators were engaged. 
Games of chance concluded the entertainment when the 
condition of the revellers permitted. 

At any large affair, an archon, or toastmaster, was 
selected by ballot or acclamation. His duty it was to 
regulate the proportions of water and wine and the size 
of the cups in which it was served. It was usual to 
commence with the smallest and end with the largest. 

At the table, the somber togas were exchanged for 
gay-colored garments (syntheses), and the shoes for

sandals. Some of the more ostentatious chang-ed their 
costumes several times during the progress of a meal. 
The head and breast were sometimes wreathed with 
flowers and ornaments. 

The tables first used were of quadrangular shape — 
three sides being decorated for the guests and the fourth 
left vacant to facilitate the movements of the attendants. 
They, however, were soon supplanted by small tables of 
marble, bronze or citrus. These and a large sideboard 
supported an amount of heavy gold and silver utensils. 

The diners reclined on costly sofas, inlaid with tor- 
toise shells and jewels, and the lower parts decked with 
embroidered gold. The pillows were stuffed with wool 
and covered witk gorgeous purple. The cushions which 
supported the elbows were covered with silk stufifs, often 
marked to designate the places of the various guests. 

Three people occupied each sofa. The lowest place 
on the middle sofa was the seat of honor. 

The room or hall was illuminated by lamps and can- 
dles, set on individual and very expensive stands or 
massed in candelabras of great magnificence. The oils 
and fats used for illumination were diluted with sub- 
stances which under the influence of heat gave forth 
odors of great fragrance. 

Each guest brought his own napkin. 

Ivory-handled knives were manufactured, but seldom 
used, as the reclining position rendered the spoons 
(Hgulae) more convenient. 

The dessert was arranged on the sideboards under 
the supervision of the pistor and structor before the 
meal commenced. 

A nomenclator was the regular employe of every 
patrician. His sole office was to prompt his master on 
the names of his guests and clients, or hangers-on. 

Much care was devoted by the wealthy to their pri- 
vate stores of wines. They were sealed in jars or bottles 
of baked clay, with labels attached bearing the year of 
the consulship during which they were made. Some old 
wines were very expensive. That of Campania was 
considered the best. The Caecuban Falernian was very

good. He was pitied who was forced to drink the 
Vatican ! 

Greek wines were popular and were found in many 
Roman cellars. 

In winter, wine was heated with water, honey and 
spices in a caldarium, a vessel fitted with a small char- 
coal furnace, closely resembling the Russian samovar. 

Being unable to sensibly decrease their riches by or- 
dinary methods, many novel ideas were put in use, often 
at great expense. 

Nero constructed in his golden house a vaulted ceiling 
which turned continuously on its axis. 

At a banquet given by Otho, tubes of gold and silver 
suddenly protruded from various parts of the hall and 
sprinkled perfumes on the assembly. 

Petronius describes a rather fanciful afifair given by 
Trimalchio. 

After the company had taken their places and young 
Egyptian slave girls had bathed their hands and feet in 
scented snow water, there was placed on the table a gold 
salver, inlaid with tortoise shell, in the middle of which 
stood an ass of bronze bearing silver panniers, one filled 
with white and the other with black olives. On his back sat 
a Silenus pouring from a wineskin the favorite sauce 
the garidn; at one side were sausages on a silver grid- 
iron, under which were plums and red pomegranate ker- 
nels to represent glowing coals, and placed around were 
trays bearing vegetables, snails, oysters and other ap- 
petizers. 

When that course had been removed, another dish was 
brought in, of which the central feature was a hen of 
carved citrus wood with expanded wings, brooding over 
a nest of peafowls' eggs. These eggs were handed 
around on silver egg-spoons weighing each more than 
half a pound. When the shells were broken, some 
of the guests were horrified to find within them half- 
hatched chicks ; but on closer inspection these proved 
to be beccaficos cooked in egg sauce. 

As the plates were being removed, a chorus of Oriental 
beauties chanted their strange songs. A slave by acci-

dent let fall a silver dish ; he stooped to pick it up — 
the atriensis boxed his ears and bade him sweep it out 
with the other fragments. 

Wine of rare virtue and great age was then brought 
in and distributed with almost obtrusive extravagance. 

The first heavy course again surprised many of those 
who were present. It consisted apparently of the most 
ordinary dishes and joints. But these proved tO' be 
merely cleverly designed covers, which on being lifted, 
disclosed roasted pigs, field fares, capons, noble bartels 
and turbots. In the centre was a plump hare which, 
by the addition of a pair of wings, had been made to re- 
semble a Pegasus. The carving was done in the pres- 
ence of the diners and tO' the strains of slow music. 

Next came a huge boar roasted whole, with two palm 
twig baskets filled with dates, hanging from his tusks. 
By his side were eight small pigs, cleverly molded in 
paste, which were presented to guests as remembrances 
of the occasion. 

Following the boar was a large swine, also cooked 
whole. After much acclamation, the carver was about 
to do his work, when with a look of disgust he an- 
nounced that it had not been disemboweled. The cook 
was called and severely chided. He feigned regret and 
made many excuses ; then seizing a heavy knife, ripped 
the animal open, letting fall into the dish a mass of 
sausages and rich puddings. 

After the pig had been carried away and while the 
dessert was being placed on the table, the ceiling opened 
and a silver hoop descended bearing gold, silver and 
alabaster phials of essences, silver and jewel coronets and 
many other things of similar character. 

The pastry had been made to resemble shellfish, field 
fares, etc. Quinces were stuck full of almonds to imitate 
sea urchins. 

Surrounded by flowers was a figure of A^ertumnus, 
with its bosom piled with fruits. The guests were in- 
vited to help themselves, and the pressure of their hands 
on the fruit caused a shower of the daintiest perfume. 

When all had partaken to repletion of the goods

served, the spirit of Bacchus was given full sway, half 
nude dancers and singers threw off all restraint, and 
there were enacted scenes of riotous carousing for which 
Rome in its decadence became notorious. 

A wierd dinner was once given by the Emperor Domi- 
tian. He invited a number of senators and knights to 
dine with him at a late hour. When they arrived they 
found that the banquet room had been draped in somber 
black. At each seat had been placed a tombstone bear- 
ing the inscription of a diner and naked black slaves 
danced weird dances and served up funeral viands on 
black dishes. When the company had been dismissed, 
its members found that all their slaves had disappeared 
and unknown bearers carried them to their homes. 
Each found on his return a message and a souvenir 
awaiting him — a silver tombstone bearing his name.

THE ANCIENT JEWS. 

Readers will find recorded in this chapter many 
things which are matters of general knowledge, but 
this, they will readily understand, is unavoidable when 
treating on the customs of so well known a people as 
the Jews and drawing on the Bible for much of the 
information given. As the facts drawn from the Scrip- 
tures have though been supplemented by the results of 
the researches of many eminent travelers and writers, it 
is hoped that the combination will be found worthy of 
the time expended on its perusal. 

The Mosaic dietary laws which for more than three 
thousand years formed the text of important srocial and 
religious observances among the inhabitants of the 
chosen kingdom were the outcome of a comparison of 
the regulations and practices of contemporary nations. 
Whether the system was compiled in the interest of 
humanity or health, it remains true that it has proved 
itself to be one of the best economic regimes ever made 
public. If for no other reason, the life of the ancient 
Jew is especially interesting to those who study the 
foods of men, past and present — although it must be 
admitted that the precepts they compiled were more 
conducive to sound digestion than some of the prac- 
tices they followed ! 

The diet of the ancient Jews consisted at first, as 
did that of all the pioneers of the human race, of but 
a few articles of food. But, though meat was not con- 
sumed in large quantities, writers err when they de- 
scribe the food of Orientals as being light and simple. 
Orientals did, and do, make use of an inordinate 
amount of grease in cooking. Eggs and rice were, 
whenever circumstances permitted, saturated with fat

or oil and meats and vegetables were frequently sim- 
mered in fat before being stewed. It was not unusual 
for a family of six or seven persons to consume an 
average of two hundred pounds a year, and some of 
their compounds would have ill suited delicate stom- 
achs. 

Bread, as in all ancient countries, constituted the 
greater part' of the food of the middle and lower 
classes. In Leviticus, Psalms and Ezekiel, reference is 
made to the "staff of bread." It was most generally 
eaten after being dipped into cheap wine or weak 
gravy. 

The fresh green ears of wheat were often eaten 
without cooking, the husks being rubbed off by hand. 
The grain was, though, more usually roasted in a pan 
after being carefully sorted over, and it was sometimes 
bruised and dried in the sun, to be afterwards served 
with oil. 

"Kibbe" was a mixture composed of cracked wheat, 
boiled and dried, beaten up with meat, onions, spices 
and the nut of a species of pine. 

Wheat was also ground by women in hand mills 
formed of two stones, the under one fixed and the 
upper movable. 

The middle classes ate meat, vegetables, fruit or fish 
also, but always as supplementary dishes to the staple 
article, bread. 

Although in the earliest days the mistress and 
daughters of the house did the baking, female servant* 
were later employed by the wealthier families. In 
Jerusalem indeed professional bakers, men, became so 
numerous that a section of the town bore the title of 
"Bakers' Street." 

The flour used in the manufacture of the common bread 
was mixed with water or milk and kneaded with the 
hands in a small wooden bowl or trough. Except in 
cases of great haste, leavening was then added. The 
dough was allowed Xo stand for several hours, some- 
times for the whole night, in moderate heat. It was 
next rolled out and cut into circular pieces about eight

51 



inches in diameter and three-quarters of an inch in 
thickness. These were occasionally punctured and 
soaked with oil. 

A more delicate kind of bread was twice kneaded be- 
fore baking-, and stimulating seeds were added to it. 
Various varieties of thin cakes were also baked everv

day and biscuits of substantial character were furnished 
for travelers. 

The professional bakers did .their work in fixed, 
specially constructed ovens, but portable ovens were 
usually found in private houses. They were in the 
shape of stone or metal jars about three feet in height, 
and were heated from the interior with wood, dried 
grass or flower stalks, ,the cakes being placed on the 
ashes or the exterior sides of the oven after the fire 
had burned down. 

In other cases, a hole dug in the ground formed the 
oven, the sides being covered with clay and the bot-

torn with pebbles. Again, sometimes the cakes were 
cooked on hea,ted stones or by the more primitive 
method of laying them directly on burning logs, or be- 
tween two layers of dried dung (then lighted and 
burned). 

Some also baked the cakes in pans with oil and ate 
them whilst hot with honey, or cooked them in such 
thin layers that they crumbled in the fingers. 

Figs were eaten fresh and dried. Pomegranates, 
mulberries, sycamore figs, citrons and apples were 
widely cultivated. Grapes were eaten raw or made 
into fruit cake (which possessed distinctly stimulating 
qualities). Similar cakes were also made of raisins, 
dates and figs — which were compressed into bricks, 
and when hardened could be cut up only by the use of 
an axe! 

The bunches of grapes often attained a weight of 
twelve pounds. 

Walnuts were plentiful. Oranges were introduced at 
a later date. 

Among the vegetables grown were lentils (which 
were boiled and eaten with butter oil or fat and pep- 
per), leeks, onions, beans, barley, lettuce, endive, purs- 
lane and other herbs. Vegetables were usually boiled 
as potage. 

The spices most in favor were cummin, dill, cori- 
ander, mint, mustard and salt. Cummin was threshed 
with a rod and with salt served as a sauce. 

Pistachio nuts and almonds were popular as whets. 

Salads were extensively known. 

Honey was used in some cakes as a substitute for 
sugar. It was also eaten raw or with other articles 
of food, even fish. 

Various artificial productions made from fruits and 
the exudations of trees and shrubs bore the title of 
honey, the best known of which was the boiled down 
juice^ of the grape, then called "d'bash," known to 
modern Arabs as "dibs." 

"Butter and honey" and "milk and honey" are in Bib- 
lical language svnonyms of the diet of prosperity. 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. S3 

The butter then used differed from our own product 
inasmuch as the hot sun ,to which the cream was ex- 
posed when being churned rendered the completed 
article more liquid. Even to-day in some parts of the 
Orient the butter served to visiting Europeans has to 
be manufactured especially for them from cold cream. 

Cheese consisted of coagulated buttermilk, dried until 
hard and then ground. 

Oil was made from various vegetables, but that of 
the olive was most esteemed. 

Wine and water were carried in vessels made of the 
skins of goats, kids or other clean animals. After 
the animal had been killed, the head, feet and tail were 
cut off and the body was drawn out of the skin, which 
was then tanned (acacia bark being sometimes called 
into service). The hairy part of the skin formed the 
exterior of the vessel, the legs and ,the end of the tail 
being sewn up. When filled, the neck was tied up. 

An ox skin was used to make a "gerba" which 
formed a storage chamber for large quantities of 
liquor. One of average size contained sixty gallons. 

The milk of cows, sheep, camels and goats was 
drank. When fresh it was known as "khalab," when 
sour as "khema." The latter was used in the compo- 
sition of salads and for cooking meats, etc. 

A strengthening beverage was made by heating milk 
over a slow fire and then adding a small piece of old 
khema or other acid to make it coagulate. Much of 
this was bottled and kept for future use. It was the 
universal refreshment offered strangers and the an- 
cient Jew, like the modern Arab, refused to accept 
payment for it. 

The other drinks of the people were barley water; 
sherbet (made by partially dissolving fig cake in 
water) ; pomegranate wine ; beer made from barley 
with herbs such as the lupin and skirret; honey, date, 
fig. millet and grape wines and a drink made by plac- 
ing raisins in jars of water and burying them until fer- 
mentation had taken place. Water was imbibed in 
large quantities after meals. 



54 Foods and Culinary Utensils of ihe Ancients. 

Vinegar was made by mixing barley with wine, or 
soured wine was used. 

The prohibition expressed in the nin.th chapter of 
Genesis against animal blood as an article of diet was 
repeated with detailed instructions in Leviticus. In- 
stead of devoting a large amount of space to recount- 
ing the regulations there expressed, it will perhaps be 
better to make only a general classification of them. 

There were interdicted : Sheret:: haaretz, creeping 
things ; sherets haof, winged insects, with the excep- 
tion of the fully developed locust; of sherets hainayiui, 
creatures dwelling in water, those which were not pro- 
vided with fins and scales ; of the feathered species 
those which were not furnished by nature with the im- 
plements with which to clean themselves ; of the quad- 
rupeds and animals of the chase those that did not 
chew the cud or were not provided with split hoofs. 

The fat parts of animals were also reserved for the 
altar and temple offerings. 

Special interdictions were announced against dead 
or injured animals; though these did not extend to 
strangers. In the New Testament, these laws are also 
mentioned as applying to healthy animals that had 
been strangled or killed in any manner other than that 
prescribed. 

In a word, the Mosaic laws prohibited the use of 
any flesh that was diseased, bruised or rendered un- 
wholesome by the presence of too much blood and also 
of the flesh of animals that were not cleanly in habits, 
diet or body. 

Oxen were not eaten when older than three years. 

It is not necessary to give here the oft-repeated 
methods of Jewish butchery, as they have been of late 
so frequently described — and highly endorsed — by med- 
ical and scientific men. 

Fresh fish (eaten generally broiled) appears to have 
been the principal article of diet in the environs of the 
Sea of Galilee. The Jews, however, were not well 
versed in the character of the different species. They 
roughly classed them as big, small, clean and unclean. 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 55 

Salt fish also was imported into Jerusalem. 

Locusts were considered to be but meagre fare, but 
they were eaten salted, dried and roasted with butter 
in a pan. 

An ordinary kitchen was equipped with a range, a 
heavy caldron, a large fork or flesh hook, a wide, open 
metal vessel for heating water, etc., two or more earth- 
enware pots and numerous dishes. 

The kid, lamb or calf, killed on the advent of a holi- 
day or in honor of a guest, would sometimes be roasted 
or baked whole, but it was usually cut up and boiled in 
a caldron filled with water or milk and set over a 
wood fire, the scum being taken off from time to time 
and salt and spices added. 

The meat and broth were served up separately or 
together as desire might dictate. 

The principal meal was held in the early evening, 
although occasionally noon was chosen for a big ban- 
quet. 

The early Hebrews seated themselves on the ground 
when partaking of a meal ; but their descendants soon 
succumbed to the example of the Egyptians and adopt- 
ed ithe reclining couch, which was universally used in 
the time of Christ. 

The first reference we have to the change in custom 
is found in the book of Amos, where the prophet re- 
bukes those who "lie upon beds of ivory." Ezekiel 
also inveighs against one who "sat on a stately bed 
with a table prepared before it." 

Each couch seated from three to five persons, and 
the women usually dined with the men. 

The meat and vegetables were sometimes served in 
one large dish, into which each in turn dipped his 
bread, but on other occasions portions were placed 
on individual plates. 

Many events were made excuses for festivals. 

The "mishteh" was a drinking party, which in the 
apostolic age was called a "komos" and w-as often the 
occasion of gross licentiousness. 

The cups used were modelled after those made by 



S6 Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 

the Egyptians. The "cup bearer" or butler held a 
very important position in a rich man's household. 

During times of fasting or sorrow, all meats, wines, 
etc.. were eschewed. They were called the "bread of 
desires." 

Prison fare consisted of bread or pulse and water. 

The vine or apples of Sodom, the "Dead Sea fruits

worthy of more than passing notice. They have 
caused a great deal of discussion among scientists and 
travelers who have differed in their opinions as to the 
identity of the fruit or plant mentioned.

W. Houghton agree ,that Josephus referred to the fruit 
of the colocynth (citrullus colocynthis) which resem- 
bles an orange in appearance, and when dry will burst 
on pressure with a crashing noise. 

The varying opinions may be ascribed to the fact 
that in the south of Palestine are found several mem- 
bers of the gourd tribe, as well as the fruits of several

shrubs and trees, which under certain conditions an-

the "Dead Sea Fruits," although the colocynth is the 
only one that answers them in every way. 

The palm tree, once so plentiful in Judaea, is now 
rare and in the vicinity of Jericho is extinct, the last 
one having died a few years ago. 

All readers of the Scriptures remember the impor- 
tant part which manna played in the history of the 
Jews. The manna which is at the present day known 
in the Arabian desert .through which the Israelites 
passed is collected in June from the tarfa or tamarisk 
shrub (Tamarix Gallica). According to Burkhardt, it 
drops from the thorns on to the sticks and leaves 
which cover the ground and must be gathered early

in ithe day or it will be melted by the heat of the sun. 
Its fall is said to be caused by the punctures made by 
insects. The Arabs cleanse, boil and strain it and put 
it up in leather bottles, and thus prepared it will retain 
its virtues for several years. It is used in the place of 
honey or butter — it is never eaten alone. It is abun- 
dant only in wet seasons, and in a very dry year it is 
not found at all. It is not exactly peculiar in character, 
as there are several shrubs in India and Syria. 

Niebuhr discovered at Mardin, in Mesopotamia, on 
the leaves of a tree, a species of capparis, a kind of 
manna which appears during the months of July and

August, being most plentiful in wet seasons. If 
shaken off before sunrise, it is pure white in color. If 
let remain, it collects until very thick, and the leaves 
are then gathered and steeped in boiling water until 
the manna floats to the top like oil. This is called 
by the natives manna essemma, heavenly manna. 

Burkhardt found in the valley of Jordan a similar 
gum on the leaves and branches of the tree gharrob 
(a species of oak), which fell to the ground in drops 
of brown-gray dew. Its taste at first was sweet, but 
after a day's exposure to the elements became acrid.

The manna of European commerce is exported from 
Calabria and Sicily. It drops from punctures made in 
a species of ash by an insect resembling the locust. It 
is fluid at night, but begins to harden in ,the morning. 

The manna of Scripture, which was the sole sup- 
port of the Israelites for forty years, must be regarded 
as miraculous, as (1) manna is under ordinary circum- 
stances stimulating rather than sustaining, (2) .the 
season in which it is found does not extend over a term 
of more than three or four months, (3) it is found only 
in small quantities compared to ,the enormous amount 
— 15,000,000 pounds a week — which would have been 
necessary to provide each member of the Israelite 
camp with the rations mentioned, (4) a double quan- 
tity certainly does not fall on the day preceding the 
Sabbath and (5) no natural product ceases at once and 
forever. 

The mustard plant mentioned in the Gospels may 
have been either the common mustard plant which 
grows to a large size in the Orient, or it may have 
been the Salvadora persica, an arboreous plant of 
abundant foliage, the seeds and leaves of which have 
a disitinct flavor of mustard.

THE CHINESE. 

It would be foolish to publish any strict dietary code 
as descriptive of the food of the people of the vast 
region generally known as the Chinese Empire, for 
apart from the difference in the products of the various 
sections of ,that diversified country, it must be remem- 
bered that the numerous tribes, which when amalga- 
mated centuries ago formed the Empire, have retained 
most of their original customs, owing partly to the 
paucity of transportation facilities and the consequent 
impediments to an interchange of ideas, partly to the 
conservative nature of the people and partly to the in- 
fluence of climate and surroundings. Furthermore, as, 
excepting a few fruits which are of comparatively recent 
introduction, such as the pineapple, the foods of China- 
men to-day closely resemble the foods of Chinamen four 
thousand years ago, it will not be necessary in this volume 
to keep very strictly apart the past and the present. 

Until quite recently it was customary to regard the 
Chinese as uncivilized and degraded heathens who vo- 
raciously devoured all kinds of vermin and other mis- 
cellaneous itit-bits which to most people of the West- 
ern Hemisphere are repulsive even in suggestion, 
hence it may be well to repeat here that, although It 
remains true that cats, dogs and rats occasionally serve 
as articles of food, this happens only when provisions 
are scarce or among the very poor, who (as in all 
civilized countries), linger always on the threshold of 
starvation. 

The Chinese, in spite of the doleful tales of some 
writers, are on the whole a well fed race. Beef and 
mutton are not plentiful except in the north, but hogs, 
poultry and fish, with vegetables, fruits and rice are 
within the reach of a majority of the population. 
Wrote a Chinese sage : "The scholar forsakes not his 
books nor the poor man his pig." Furthermore, in 
the preparation of their national dishes the Chinese 



Foods and Culinary Utensils of flic Ancients. 6l 

cooks (especially those in the cities and in the house- 
holds of the rich) display a high degree of skill. 

Wheat, several varieties of rice and sweet potatoes 
are grown in all parts of the Empire, and barley, 
sorghum, cabbages, beans and other vegetables and 
sugar cane are also raised in large quantities. 

Rice is seldom ground except when made into cakes. 

The sorghum, or hauliang (extensively cultivated in 
the north), is not used as in America for the manu- 
facture of sugar, but the seeds are ground and made into 
a coarse bread or used for the preparation of some brands 
of whiskey. 

Swefet pOitatoes are sliced into coarse strips and dried 
in the sun. It is, though, considered a sign of extreme 
poverty to be seen eating them at any meal other than 
a lunch or hurried repast. 

Of the vegetables, the petsae or white cabbage is 
the most widely cultivated. 

Beans grow luxuriantly. Fully one-half of the crop 
is crushed for the sake of the oil, the residue being 
pressed into bricks and used as a fertilizer. 

"Bean curds" is a very popular dish, especially for 
breakfast. The beans are ground to a flour, which is 
passed through three strainers of coarse, medium fine 
and very fine linen. This is boiled for an hour over 
a slow fire until the proper consistency is obtained. 

Salted beans form quite an important article of com- 
merce. Four catties of beans are put in a jar with on* 
catty of salt, half a catty of ginger and a few taels 
of almonds and spices. The jars are then sealed and 
left untouched for about a month. 

A more novel way is to put the beans in earthen- 
ware jars filled with very clear spring water, changing 
the water every four hours. In seven days tender 
shoots have appeared and the beans are then sold as 
a delicacy. 

Peanuts are grown for the sake of their oil. 

Hsiang-yu is a fragrant oil made from peanuts and 
beans, which is used for the toilet and by the poor for 
cooking. Castor oil answers the same purposes.

a tub placed beneath. Lime is added to the juice and 
it is then immediately boiled. 

Within the limits of Cliinese territory are found al- 
most all known varieties of fruits, some of which are 
indigenous to it. 

The whampee is a yellow skinned fruit about the 
size of a grape which hangs in clusters from the 
glossy-leaved trees which produce it. The flavor is 
tart and its ,three or four stones are of a greenish color. 

The li-chi has a rough red exterior. Inside is a white 
film which incloses a watery translucent pulp of a 
sweetish taste and a brownish black ovoid stone. 

The lo-quat is a species of medlar. 

Oranges, ginger, etc., are preserved in sugar. 

Ducks are raised in almost incredible numbers. Their 
eggs and those of fowls are frequently hatched by arti- 
ficial heat. 

Eggs that have been preserved in lime for several, 
sometimes a great many, years are much esteemed. 
After a quarter of a century, the yellow assumes a dark 
brown color and the whites have the appearance of 
meat jelly — strange though it may seem, they are 
really excellent in that condition.

All foods served at a genuine Chinese dinner are 
previously cut into minute particles. The large roast 
pieces w^hich adorn the tables at dinners given in sea-

dishes are partaken of by all present directly from the 
common bowl. 

It is considered a token of hospitality on the part of 
the host or friendliness on the part of an acquaintance 
to take an especially choice piece of meat or vegetable 
from the bowl and to place it on the plate or in the 
mouth of a fellow diner. 

The itwo chopsticks are both held in the right in-

Stick remains motionless, the other is so manoeuvred 
as to entrap with ease a morsel of meat or even the 
smallest grain of rice. 

The sticks (square at the top and round for the 
rest of their length) are made of bamboo or more 
precious woods, ivory or silver. On the upper por- 
tions, poems and pictures are often engraved. 

Spoons are used for liquids. 

An ordinary meal among the middle classes con- 
sists of eight dishes — two vegetables, eggs, fish, shell 




fish, bird and two meats (pork and goat; or, in some 
parts of the north, mutton and beef). 

With this will be served a large tureen of soup 
with rice, the latter taking the place of bread. 

When eating rice, the bowl is raised by the left 
hand to a close proximity ,to the mouth and the rice 
is rather scooped than picked up. 

The importance which is attached to rice as a life- 
sustaining article may be judged from the exclama- 
tion of a Chinese sailor when he was informed that it 
was held in but secondary repute in America. Throw- 
ing up both hands with an expression in which were 
combined horror and pity, he cried: "Oh, the sterile 
region of barbarians which produces not the necessaries 
of life ; strange that the inhabitants have not long ago 
died of hunorer !"

Two good meals a day, the customary number, and 
a light luncheon, will in the average native home repre- 
sent the expenditure of about ten cents in American 
money. 

Wine is served only on special occasions. 

The hotels in the large cities are distinguished by 
titles as in this country, though the Chinese proprietor 
gives freer rein ,to his imagination, choosing such titles 
as "Cum Lee" (Golden Profits), "Cut Shing" (Rank 
Conferring Hotel), the "Cut Sing" (Fortunate Star), 
etc. They are often comparatively tall structures and

are usually clustered together in one quarter of the 
town. 

The ground floor of the ordinary hotel is reserved 
for the proprietor's apartments and the kitchen. The 
first floor contains one public and several private din- 
ing-rooms ; and the second and upper floors are divided 
into sleeping apartments — the partitions of which are 
so thin that even a whispered conversation is in- 
telligible to a party in the adjoining room. 

'iliere is not much comfort to be obtained in the vil- 
lages, and the accommodations are worse in the south 
and central districts than in the north and Mongolia. 

The country caravansary is built in the form of a 
quadrangle with the walls, in the North, of mud or 
clay.

In the one public room, the itraveler perforce mingles 
with cattle drovers and muleteers, but the private 
apartments are fairly comfortable. 

The stables are usually attached to the building, 
with large compounds for sheep or cattle. Some of 
the larger establishments boast separate quadrangle 
stables, while some of the smaller have none at all, the 
animals being hitched to troughs or racks in the centre 
of the quadrangle.

In some cities are khans which act as depots for 
the goods of traveling merchants, who are boarded and 
lodged without charge until they have disposed of 
their stock, the landlord then receiving a small per- 
centage of the sales.

The proprietor of a public inn is compelled to fur- 
nish the authorities each month with a list of the per- 
sons whom he has lodged or fed, and women are not 
received at all in the public hotels in the South. 

The restaurants in the cities are often quite large, 
running to two and three stories in height. 

On the ground floor is the kitchen. On the first 
floor at the head of the first staircase is the public 
dining room where a good cheap meal can be obtained, 
and on the second and third floors are the private and 
more select chambers. In each room is a bill of fare. 

An ordinary first class restaurant dinner comprises 
ivon\ ten to thirty dishes, and for any special occasion 
a hundred or more are often served. 

Below is the menu of a dinner which, if served to 
eight or ten persons at a good public city restaurant, 
would cost about seventy-five cents per head!

The diners are usually seated at square tables in 
groups of eight. 

Chinese whiskey or wine is served in small double- 
handled cups, which are constantly replenished by 
the attendants from vessels resembling silver cofifee 
pots. Pipes of tobacco are also passed around at 
intervals. 

Before eating, the host or most prominent guest

Pastry is brought on between courses. If salt, a

cup of chicken broth ; if sweet, ahnond milk is fur- 
nished with it. 

No napkins are provided, pieces of coarse brown 
paper being used in their stead. 

The last is a sort of "trial of appetite" course. It 
consists of large dishes — sometimes eight or ten ar- 
ranged in pyramid form — and the ever forthcoming- 
refusal to partake of it announces the termination 
of the meal. 

The attendants .then bring in towels and bowls of 
hot water. They immerse the towels in the water, 
and after wringing them out present them to the 
guests in ithe order of their importance. 

On special occasions the water is scented with otto of 
roses. 

One habit of the attendants which is especially 
surprising to the novice is that as their labors dur- 
ing the meal increase the temperature of their 
bodies, the waiters divest themselves of the greater 
part of their clothing!

One restaurant in Canton which caters for the 
cheaper class of trade, feeds on an average five thou- 
sand persons daily. Each patron is served with por- 
tions of regular size, and allowance is made for any 
pieces which he may not eat. 

The tea saloons are divided into two large rooms 
furnished with stools and tables. Cakes, preserved 
fruits and tea are served. The cups are usually cov- 
ered so as to prevent the aroma of the tea from 
evaporating. 

"Dog and cat" restaurants consist of one large pub- 
lic apartment, with the entrance to the dining room 
through the kitchen. 

Soup stalls are found on the street corners of the 
cities. They sell luncheons of fish, pork, soups, 
vegetables, fried locusts, etc., from one to two cents. 

The oven, or, to speak more accurately, the baking 
apparatus, of the average establishment is somewhat 
singular. It consists of a furnace resembling a cop- 
per in shape, built in the center of an outhouse. The 
hollow part (which is shallow) is filled with charcoal. 
A lid, which fits the aperture, is so suspended by 
chains from the beams above as to be capable of ele- 
vation or depression. Upon this lid, pastry and cakes 
are placed and kept directly above or at any distance 
from the fire, according to the heat desired. 

The bakers often manufacture their bread without 
the use of shortening of any description. 

A very popular cake consists partially of mince- 
meat. The baker before commencing to make it, 
places a pile of dough on one side and opposite it a 
heap of mincemeat — a mixture of pork, sugar, spices, 
etc. He then pulls ofT a piece of dough, rolls it into 
a ball, flattens it, covers it with the meat, rolls it into 
a ball again, shapes it into a ring and flattens it by 
a stroke of the hand mto a cake of definite size and 
thickness. 

Among other dainty dishes of Chinaland are the 
"t'ien ya tzu," a species of delicately flavored fat duck ; 
' feng chi," salted chicken ; a dish of amber gelatine ; 



yo Foods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. 

a salad of bamboo shoots ; "huo t'ui," a dainty ham 
of the appearance of veal ; "yii ch'ih," shark's fins, and 
"hai li tzu," devilled oysters with mushrooms. 

Other items are salted earthworms, pigeon's eggs, 
pounded shrimps ; bird's nest soup, a gelatinous article ; 
beches de mer (sea slugs), water beetles and silk- 
worms, the last named fried in oil after they have 
made .their cocoons. 

A much admired soup, prepared for an imperial 
feast, was of blood and mare's milk. 

Oysters are very cheap in winter, selling at from 
five to six cents per pound. 

The following receipts may be of interest as literal 
translations from a genuine Chinese cook book: 

Steamed Shark's Fins. 

Take the sun-dried shark's fins, place in a cooking pan, add 
wood ashes and boil in several waters. Then take out and scrape 
the roughness from the fins. If not clean, boil again and scrape 
again until clean. Then change the water and boil again. Take 
out and remove the flesh, keeping only the fins themselves. Boil 
again and put in spring water. The frequent changing of the 
water is necessary to take out the lime taste. Put the fins into 
the soup and stew until quite tender. Dish in a bowl, placing 
crab meat below and a little ham on top. 

Chicken unth the Liquor of Fermented Rice. 

Bone a chicken and steam until just right ; take out and let cool, 
then cut into thin slices. Next, take gelatinous rice which has 
been fermented with yeast and water ; cook this for two hou/s, 
add a little of the juice expressed from fresh ginger, soy, 
sesamum and oil. Mix together with peanut oil. Dish and add 
fragrant herbs. 

Genii Ducks. 

Take a fat duck; open and clean. Take two mace of salt, rub 
it both outside and inside and put into an earthen dish. Take 
one cup of fan spirits and put (the cup with the spirits) inside 
the duck — only the vapor of the spirits is wanted. Steam over 
water until quite tender, then lift out the wine cup and put the 
bird into a bowl. 

The most common native liquor are "suee chow," 
a rice brandy ; "shas chin," an impure alcohol made 
from kauliang or sorghum; "huary chin," a yellow 



Poods and Culinary Utensils of the Ancients. ?t 

wine made from millet, and various spirits extracted 
from plums, apples, pears, etc. All liquors are drunk 
hot, and some of them are §tee]:)ed with spices or the 
leaves of flowers. 

Although spirits are plentiful and cheap, drunken- 
ness is rare. 

Tea, of course, is consumed by all classes. 

A curious custom annually observed is the pro- 
pitiatory offering to the God of the Kitchen, who is 
worshipped in all parts of China, and who is supposed 
to report his observations to the Pearly Emperor Su- 
preme Ruler. 

He is represented in each kitchen by a slip of white

or red paper (changed each year as a rule) bearing his 
name and title and sometimes his portrait, pasted on 
the wall in some convenient part of the room. 

Among the better classes the kitchen god is also 
known as the superintendent or inspector of good and 
evil. 

On the evening of the tWenty-third day of the

by about sixty per cent of the population. Meats, 
cakes, fruits and wines are offered with candles, in- 
cense, mock money, etc., and all members of the fam- 
ily then kneel reverently before his representation and 
bow their heads in homage. 

On the evening of the twenty-fourth those who 
have not participated in the ceremonies of the previous 
day, make a vegetable offering in a similar manner.

The numerous sailing vessels on the rivers and 
lakes are as well fitted to supply the wants of the 
traveler as the hotels on shore. 

The houseboats and some of the passenger boats 
rely for itheir meals on the kitchen boats, which are 
really admirably managed. 

The fishing boats make use of a very primitive 
heating apparatus — a large boiler in an earthenware 
furnace set in a part of the deck, serving as the gen- 
eral cook book.

the curious festivities which celebrate so many occa-

works that a description of them here would perhaps 
savor too much of needless repetition.
