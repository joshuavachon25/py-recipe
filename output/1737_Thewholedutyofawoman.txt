FAIR SEX. 

Chap. I. 
QTReligion. 

f S a very pious end ingenious Author has obierv- 
5 ed, That altho* the Female may be thought by 
i {omCy tho' iure very unjuAly, to be inferior in 
" their bitelleAoals to the other Sex, yet, in the 
&blaneil Part of Humanity, no one can di4>ute their £- 
A 2 quali^} 



4 ^he whole Duty of 'a WoMA>i.' - " 

quality ; they have Souls of as divine an Original, as end^ 
Icfs a Duration, and as capable of infinite Happinefs. 
It ought then to be the firft Care of the Fair Sex, as it 
is to all Mankind, the Matter of greateft Concern, to re- . 
gard the Promifes of anoth'jr Life, nor is there any Thing i 
that can make thena eafier or more amiable in this. 

The diftindt and moft principal Scenes in which a 
Woman can be iiippofed to be an Adtor,- are thefe three, 
VrKGiNiTY, Marriage, and Widowhood; which- 
as they differ widely from each other, fo for the difcharg* 
ing their refpeftive Duties, there are particular Cautions' 
worthy to be obferved. 

Virginity, or the Virgin State, is firft in Order of 
Time 3, the grand Element eflential to this State is Mode- 
fly, which, tho' neceflary to all, is in a more eminent De- 
gree required here. It is the very Charadteriftick of this 
Sex, as Courage is of the other ; for as the great Mr. ^^Z- 
di/on obferves, As a Man with6ut Courage is (aid to be no 
Man, fo a Woman without Modefty is as much, out of Nsb* 
ture and Kind. Modefty in Virgins ftiould appear in its 
hlgheft Elevation : But as all Virtues are to be acquired ]^y 
the Helps of Religion, and as none can be truly virtuous 
or happy without it^ we fhallj, in the firft Place, endea- 
vour to give our Fair Readers an Idea of the tme Spirit of 
the Chrijlian Religiotty which in every View and Defign 
direftly tends to make us eafy with ourfelves, kind and 
'Comfortable to one another here, and happy with God* 
j^reafter. . , ^. 

It is evident that our holy .Religion • is a wife Inftitution' 
to feYt^l'y'one,' who cewifidcrsthat God is ite Author, tvrhofc 
'Wifdoni appears in all hi« WOrks^ti Thusi the Frame* of 

- .. ' - vifible 



I'be whole DvTY .of a WofAAif. 5 

vlfible Nature being agreeably fet together, and having each 
Part of it fuited to ufeful and proper Ends, demon Urates 
iticlf to be the Work of divine Wifdom -, in like manner 
the whole Plan. of pure Religion, having alfo its Parts fuit- 
able to each other, and every one of them agreeably fet 
to the &me good and great Defign of the whole, does 
thereby prove itfdf to be the Contrivance of an All-wife 
God. 

. And hercA)y the; Wifdom of the Chriftian Religion will 
particularly appear, becaufe every Part of it tends to pro- 
mote the unvicrlal Good of Mankind j for which Reafbn 
the divine Founder thereof was named Jesus, that is. 
Saviour, becaufe his only Dcfign was to fave us from the 
prevailing Power of Sin, and iiipm thofe Miferics in which 
that evil Power would involve us. 

Thus Temperance promotes our Health, Juftice in our 
Dealings prevents us from fuftaining the Revenges of the 
Injured, and gains us Truft among Men, with all the Be- 
nefits, which arife from thence. Charity, by promoting 
the common Good of others,, draws back their Love and 
Afledion to ourfclvcs, while Patience preferves Quiet with- 
in our own Breafts, and Self-Denial, by reftraining our 
extravagant Appetites, eftablifhes the juft Power of Reafba 
over us j thereby fitting us for all Conditions of Life -, and 
thus the Law; of Chtifl: anfwers to the Charader of Wif- 
dom, by its Agreeablenefs to the beft Defign of God in 
the chief Good of Man : And upon tliis Account SoJomou 
chara(3:ered the Idea.qf .Religiqn- under the Name of Wif- 

Befixie jtn^e iporpj: D^^ arq feveral Threats of 

Ood's todgnjyenis and ^rromifes of his Favour coBtaincd

in Chrift's Inftitution ; the former were wifely defigned to' 
reftrain us from Immoralities, which are oar greateft Fol- 
lies.; and the latter to engage us In the Pradice of Virtue^ 
which is our greateft Wifdom : The Threatnings prepare 
the Way for the Promifes, and qualify us to receive them ; ■ 
inafmuch as they (hake off our Aficdions from ill Objedls^ 
in order for the Promifes, to fix them upon good ones. We 
muft needs ceafe to do Evil before we can learn to do wclK 

Now, altho' a due Confideration of the divine Nature 
will carry us on to the Belief of a jfiiture State, in which 
he, who is in Perfedion, the beft of all Beings, will diftin- 
guifti the Good from the Bad by ample Rewards and juft 
Punilhments; yet, becaufe every one*s Capacity may not 
be fufficient to make this wife Refleftion, therefore Jefus 
Chrift was pleafed to bring Life and Immortality to lights 
as the Gofpel phrafes it, /. e. to give the World fiill Affu- 
rance of a future State, in which the juft God will diftin- 
guiflb Men hereafter in iiich a Manner as they fhall diftin- 
guifh themfelves here ; and it is the Wifdom of evciy one 
to preferve this Belief in his Heart, and bear it always 
about him, becaufe it is the moft awfiil Monitor againft 
our committing Folly, and yields the ftrongeft Encourage- 
ment to Virttie. 

From what has been faid, we hope it may be feen, Pirft^ 
What is meant by faving a Soul, viz, to deliver it from 
vitious Habits and fearful Puni(hments, the fatal Confe- 
quents of fuch Habits ; and by eftiablilhing Virtue therein 
to recommend it to the Favour of God. And Secondly^ 
That the Gofpel of Chrift . was defigned to this very End, ' 
and its Tendency hereunto is its \Vildom. And Thirdly^ 
From hence you alfo perceive in wliat Reipcd Faith m 

Jefus 



lie wb^le VVTY tf a VloMAK. 7 

Jefiis Ckrift 18 iaid to fave as, viz. bccaufe this Faith is 
our receiving the Chriflian Moral for the Rule of our Lives, 
and the Threats and Promiiea coptain'd in the Gofpel for 
the outward Motives of our Pradtice according to that 
Rule. 

And from theiib three Confiderations iumm'd up together, 
you txxay examine all the various Pretences whicn differing 
Churches and Condoiunions make to the Purity of the Chri* 
ilian Faith, £> as to form a right Judgment of 'em ; for 
that Comxzwiion which n^anifeils itielf to have no other 
Defign than to aiOft its Members in faving their Souls from 
the Power of Sin, by the Motal and Motives aforementi- 
on'd, is certainly the pureft Church i and that Faith which 
has 00 other Tendency, is the pprefl Faith : So that if 
you form yourfelf upon this Principle, you may pa& by 
all nice Speculations^ or profound Myfteries which have 
no dire^ Tendency to improve your Morals, without any 
Hazard of Salvation* 

Secandlyy As the ChriAjan InAitution is wiiely pra&ica|, 
fo it is plain ; or in other Words we may fav, that as the 
Wifdom of the Chriilian Reli^on appears firit by its being 
practical, fb it appears fecondly by being plain. The ob- 
fcure Anfwers vfl^h were given out from the old Heathen 
Oracles, are now known to have proceeded from the In- 
dixe&nefs of a deiigning Priefthood ; who, to maintain 
their Pretence of foretelling what fhall come to pafs, knt 
back all thofe who came to enquire after fiiture Events with 
doubti^ aad Uftcertain Anfwers. And it has been the Ob^ 
iervation of wife Men, that when any one aiFeds'fo be 
dark aot) myfteriona in his Converi&tion^ either he has 

fooDue iodii:«& Pe%a i^£) d9U>g^ or die, whililr he makes 

an 



8 ^e ivbole Duty of aV/ouAifs 

an Oftentatiori of Wifdom, he does in reality but 3ifcovcr 
his Folly.. ' 

Now the Wifdom of God cannot be conceived to aim 
at any other Defign in communicating itielf to us, thart 
the Information of our Minds in the Nature of Good and 
Evil, and this in order todired: our Choice; and all In- 
ftruftions muft of neceffity be plain, fince *tis by Things 
cafy and familiar, futh as at firft fight we may apprehend; 
whereby we can be led on to the Knowledge of Matters 
more remote and difficult ; but obicure and uninteUigible 
Do(ftrines can have no £fie<ft upon us befide unprofitable 
Amufemcnt ; and wbatfiever is by the Wifdom of God luid 
out of our Reachy can be no Part of our Concern^ 

Farther, to what End did he give us in telledual' Facul- 
ties? Surely not toamufe but to improve us, by enabling 
us throughly to underftand each Part of -our holy Religion, 
which directly tends to this End, viz. our moral Improve- 
ment, as you will foon perceive, if you reduce the Chriftian 
Inftitution to its general Heads, which are theie.

Duty, and eameftly to recommend it to our Practice. 

t • 

Fir^j The Reader fees, that the Matters of Fadl con- 
tained in the four Gofpels^ and Uic Adts of the Aperies, 

viz. 



ll)e whole Du ty^/^^Woman. 9 

viz. the Travels and TraniaiSions of Chrift and his Dis- 
ciples, are fo plainly related, that you underftand the Re* 
lation aseafily as you read it. And Second/y, All Laws 
muft be plain, becaufe they arc Diredions. Now, obfcure 
Directions are but Deluiions ; and Laws which are dubi^ 
ous and difficult to be underftood, are Traps and Snares, 
And Thirdly^ 'T is as neceflary that Motives (hould be very 
intelligible, becaufe their Defign is to work ftrongly upon 
our Wills, by convincing our Underftandings, Add to 
this Fourthly^ That myftical and unintelligible Exhorta- 
tions are ridiculous, upon which Account St. Paul forbad 
Religious Exercifes to be performed in an unknown 
Tongue. 

Now as the four Goipels and A£ts of the Apoftles con^ 
tain Matters of Fad, Laws, and Motives } fo the Epiflle; 
contain Exhortations to Serioufnefs and Piety, ariiing frorn 
the Laws, Fadts and Motives before*inentioned : And 
thefe Books are fuffiqiently compreheniive of the Inflitu- 
tions and Ordinances of Jefus Chrift \ which ought indeed 
to be eafily intelligible, becaufe they concern the poor^ 
weak) and unlettered People as rnuch as the Learned. 

Nor can it be fuppofed that the Doftrine of Chrift was 
by him, or his Apoftles, deliver'd firft of all into the 
Hands of the Learned to be by them con vey'd into the Minds 
of the Ignorant > but on the contrary, 'tis manifeft that 
our Saviour directed both his Difcourfes and A&ions im-> 
mjediately to the common People as well as to the Scribe; 
and in like manner did his Difciples addrefs their Preach-r 
ings and Writings. : 

From all this Diicourfe concerning the Clearneis of 
Chrift's Inftitution, you may ijpare yourfelf the needleis 

B ' ' Trouble 



i 



10 55&^ tvboJe Duty ^tf Woman. 

Trouble of reading abftnifc and myfterious Points of Di- 
vinity. Nor need you fufier yourfclf to be amns'd with 
the pretended deep Speculations of profound Men, when 
you have th^ plain Diredions of a wife and a good God 
before you, in following whereof you ihall meet with 
great Reward. 

Thirdfyy The Chriftian Inftitution is ihort. True and 
genuine Religion has always been fumm*d up, and gathered 
together into a narrow Compafs, by thofe who beft undcr- 
ftood it. Thus Micah (vi. 8.) fpeaking of God, faith. 
He hath Jhewn thee, O Marty what is gcod ; and what doth 
the Lord thy God require rfthee^ iut to do jujily^ to love 
Mercy y and to walk humbly with thy God. And our Sa- 
viour films up the whole Law in our Love to God, and 
our Neighbour. And in another Place includes the whole 
Scope of the Law and the Prophets, m this one Rule^ 
Whatfoever ye would that Men Jhould do unto you^ even Jo 
do ye unto them ; hereby direding us to make a right Ufe 
of that Reafon which God eftabUfh*d as his Oracle in our 
Breafls ; to which we may at all times refort, and from 
whence we may be refolv*d in fuch Cafes as concern our 
Duty to one another. 

• Fbr, as by confulting your own Reafon, you know 
wherein you are juftly deaU with, and wherein you receive 
Wrong 5 When you arc kindly us'd, and when otherwife i 
fb from the fame Principle of Reafon you cannot but know 
when you deal juftly or wrongfully, and when you do kind 
or iH* Offices to another: This one fhort comprchenfivc 
JR.ule, takixtg for ' its Foundation the Equality of Mankind 
in refped of their comtnton Nature^ renders Religion it- 
felf a Matter fenfiblc untaiis^ 

For 



92^ whale Dnrv of a^toHAVl II 

For we can fed the Woond of a fharp flanderous 
Tongue as lenfibly as that of a Sword ; we can feel the 
Wrongs done to ourfelves and Families ; and are as much 
fbnfible of the Benefits we enjoy from the juft and kind 
Dealings of thofe with whom we are concerned, and herC'* 
by we are in the (horteft and plained way admonifh'd of 
our Behaviour to others ; and if this one (hort Rule were 
teduc'd to pradice, the State of Paradiie would be reftor'd, 
and we ihould enjoy a Heaven upon Earth. 

For hereby, FJrfi, All Perfecutions for Confcience fake, , 
^which have occafion'd fuch violent Diforders and vail £f- 
fufion of Blood, would be at an End, becaufe every one, 
who has any Conlcience, would moft willingly preferve it 
fi:iee fiom the Impofitions of Men in the Worihip of God. 
To compd Men by Fire and Faggot to partake even of a 
delicious Entertainment, is a favage ibrt of Hofpitaiity. 

Secmdly^ All Factions in any State would be at an End, 
if every Member thereof were contented that every one of 
his Fellow-Members, who was not an Enemy to the Go- 
vernment, might, having equal Pretence of Merit, enjoy 
opial Privileges with himielf. 

nirdly^ The Occaiions of War and Law-Suits wbuld 
be taken away ; fince nothing but manifeft Wrong can be 
the juft Cauie of either. 

And Fourthly^ There would be no private Quarrels and 
Uneafineis among Neighbours, fince by this Rule of doing 
as we would be done unto, all ra(h Cenfures, (harp Re- 
flexions, ui^ounded Su^icions and Jealoufies, which are 
the Seeds of private Animofities, are taken away. And

among us, who will meafure out hi^ Kindnefs to us in the 
iame manner as we meafure out ours to one another. 

The Reafon why Religion fhould be both a (hort and 
plain Inftitution, will appear if you confider the. common 
Circumftances and Conditions of Men in this World. For 
though many have Leifure enough to read and digeil whole 
Volumes of ufeful Knowledge (if there are any fuch) yet 
the greateft Part of Mankind being necef&riiy employ'd 
in making daily- Provifions" for themfelvcs and Families, 
and difcharging the common Offices ^of^Life, cannot at- 
tend to any religious Inftitution which is either difficult or 
tedious. • ..... 

'Tis certain, That the whole Life of Man is not fuffici- 
ent for him to read all the Controverfies which have heed: 
written upon pretence of Religion ; but 'tis, as certain^' 
That God never lays on us a greater Task than what he 
affords us both Abilities and Opportunities to perform ; 
wherefore we may conclude, That fince the Duties of Re- 
Kgion are hid in common upon all, the poor Day-Labour-i 
er muft have Ability and Opportunity fufficient tp infbudb 
himfelf therein, without hindering the. con ftani Work o£ 
his Calling. And in all this the Wiidom' and ,Goodnefs 
of God are made known, by adapting our Duties to our' 
Circumftances of Life. - i 

• From hence you ftiay lave yourfeif the Trouble of read- 
ing thelong and tedious Difputes which with fuch intern^ 
perate'Zeal are always in Agitation among the feveral Par-: 
ties of Chriftian^. Indeed, the true Chriftian : inftitution. 
being fhort^ it cannot admit of being fpun out into long. 
Controverfies: And -tho- there are many Books of Contro-. 
verfial Divinity, there cannot be -one Controverfy about the 

Matter 



^ ''mbpyjiiv'TY $f a Woman.' i^t 

Matter of mccr Rdigidn, as whether we (hould maintain 
in our Hearts a high Reverence and Veneration for Al- 
mighty God ? Whether we ought to walk before him in 
Sincerity and Uprightnels ? Whether or no we fhould be 
thankful to him for all the Benefits which we have received 
from him ? Whether we (hall fubmit to his Will with Pa- 
tieoce, and endeavour to govern our Paffions, to bring 
them to a due Moderation and Temper, by making them 
fubjcdt to the Law of Reafon ? Whether we {hould be 
true to our Promifcs, juft in our Dealings, charitable to 
tjie Poor, and fincere in our Devotions? Whether we 
fhould be temperate and fober, modefl: and chafte, and 
demean ourielves in an humble,- civil, and agreeable man- 
ner towards thofe with whom we converfe ? Whether we 
fhould be heartily lorry when we come fhort of our Duty, . 
and (hould be watchful in the Denial of our irregular Ap- 
petites, PaflSons, and evil Inclinations for the future? In. 
fbort, it has not beep difputed whether Juflice, Benignity, 
Meckneis, Charity, Moderation, Patience and Sobriety, 
^ould be received into our Aflfedlionsj or whether we 
ftiould love God and our IS^eig hour ? Orthodoxy of Faith 
is made the Pretence of Controverfy, but the one thing* 
DccefJary is Orthodoxy of Practice. 

In this Difcottrie upon the Subjed: of Religion, Devo- 
tyn?. ought not to b€;lp^ out^ becaufe Thankfulnefs is a ne- 
ceflary Part of Religion, and Prayer is the Prefervative 
of the whole. A frequent Repetition of our Thanks .for 
all the Benefits we enjoy, prefcrve in our Minds the Con- 
federation of God as the greatefl and befl of Beings j, and 
thereby rttfurifhes Vencratipn and Grajitude. In like maji-^ 
ner Prayer for J^ardpn .of Sin^ and JPrefcngtVpn: ofi our 

Perfons,

Perfons, is a conftant Recognition of the Mercy and Boun* 
ty of God : But Prayer againfl: the Power of Sin is the 
adlual withdrawing of our Inclinations from Bvil; and 
Prayer for any Grace is an adaal Application of our 
Minds, to attain the particular Virtue for which we pray. 

Now altho* we would not adviie againft fet Hours and 
Forms of Devotion, cither private or publick, yet, we 
would rather recommend a fort of habitual and occaiional 
Devotion, as very proper to prefer ve the ftrongeft Imprefli- 
ons of Religion upon your Mind. 

It may be obferv*d, that many who are very pun^al 
in keeping to their exaA Times and Forms of Devotion, 
have fallen (hort of any vifible Improvement in Virtue. 
The fame Pride, Frowardneife, Fauhood, Covetoufiiefi^ 
and Bitterfiefs of Spirit, have appeared in many who have 
been conftant Frequenters of the Publick as well as Clofet 
Forms of Prayer, as if God had not been in all their 
Thoughts. The Reafon whereof feems to be, becaufe their 
formal Petitions fuperfede their habitual Endeavours. Men 
are apt to think that fince they fpend in every Day fuch 
a Portion of Time in Prayer, they have done all their 
Part J and fo they leave God Almighty to take care of the 
Event : And this is indeed all we can do when we make 
our Petitions to our Benefactors upon Earth, viz. older up 
our Requefts to them, either by Word or Writing, and 
then only expedt their Anfwer. 

But 'tis otherwifc with relation to God. Our Petitions 
to him muft not take off from our conftant Endeavours to 
perform that Work for which w6 pray his Enablement : 
And this occaiional Devotion^ which we would fecom-> 
mend, is in its own Natuce a conftant Endeavour after 

Virtue,

Virtue, as well as a ferious Petition for it : For it arifeth 
from a frequent Obfervation of ourielves in our particu- 
lar occurring Circumftances ; from which Obfervation fiiit- 
aWe Defires will almoft neceflarily flow : As if at any Time 
we find that we have done an ill Thing, immediately 
upon the Diicovery, we (hould beg God's Pardon, and 
rdblve to make Recompence for the 111 we have done : 
Or if we have defign'd any Evil in our Hearts, and pre- 
iently beg Pardon of him who knoweth the Secrets there- 
of; in fo doing we have given Check to its Progrefi. In like 
manner, if we have ipoken flanderoufly, rafhly, or injuria 
oudy, .concerning any one; and upon Recolledion thereof 
we ask Forgiveneis of God, and. deiire that we may not 
do the like for the future ; but on the contrary, that we 
may govern our Tongues better : In all this we are labour* 
ing to vtdthdraw our Souls from Evil, and to form our- 
fclves upon a Principle of Virtue. 

Every Night and Morning are proper Times of Leifiire 
to call to Mind the Preiervation, Support, and Advantages 
we have received the Day or Night preceding : And this 
Recdle<Stion being accompany'd with Thankiulne& to our 
great Preferver, is the a<^al Continuance and carrying on 
of our Gratitude to God, If we perceive Pride or Paffion 
to arife in our Hearts, fb that we are apt to put a great 
Value upon every thing we do, and defpife others; or if 
we find ourfelves eagerly concerned for any little Worldly 
Advantage, or any fmall Punctilio of Honour, and here-

. We cannot but feci the Diforders of our Minds, as 
-much as the Difcafes of our Bodies ; and the Cauies of a 
diforder'd Mind are much more eafily difcern'd, than the 
Caufes of a Bodily Diftcmper : For either our Minds are 
troubled for Want or Lofles, or it may be for the Profperi- 
ty of others, or want of a Revenge, or becaufe we cannot 
have our Will in what we dcfign*d. Upon thefe or fuch 
like Occafions, the proper Cure is Devotinal in begging 
•God*s Pardon for our Difcontent ; and being defirous that 
our Wills fliould be fiibmitted to his who has taught us that 
we fhould not return Evil for Evil, but that we flbould love 
our Neighbours as ourfelves. This fort of Soliloquy, and 
occafional mental Addrefs to God, is a fure way to compofe 
the Difor4ers of our Thoughts. For the growing Power 
of any Sin is moft certainly fupprefs'd by introducing the 
oppolite Virtue into our Defircs. 

The fame Method may be ufed as to Sins of Omiflion. 
A ferious Perfoa will obferve Negledts of common Duties, 
which re^e€t either God or Man. He cannot but take 
Notice how much he has negleded his Bufinefs, or his 
Health ; how little he has confider'd God as his Owner, 
Governor and Benefactor ; and how fmall a Portion of 
what God has blcfs'd him with he has laid out upon the 
Good of his Fellow-Creatures. And if hereupon a Man 
is ferioufly defirous to become more dutiful to God, more 
ufeful to himfclf, and beneficial to others, he is therein 
adtaally beqding his Mind to fupply his fornaer Omiflions* 

This cafual Devotion arifing firom the Obfervation of 
ourfelves,. under the common Circumftances of Life (aU 
tho' it can have lio fet Times and Forms prefcrib'd to it) 
wilT be very effeftual ta produce, prefervc, and increafe a 

true 



lie 'Uftoie'Dvt v^ 41 Woman, ij 

true Senlb of Religion within os. And if you are pleased 
to apply your Thoughts heieunto, as occafion (hall diretft 
you» this Devotion will foon become habitual^ cudomary 
And eafy : And its Remrns^ which will be frequent and 
ihort, will be a contkiual Reftraint from eyil-doing, and 
an adual Exercife of Virtue. 

This Exercife is commonly referv*d to be performed all at 
once^ in an a€hial Preparation before receiving the Sacra- 
ment of the LoitD'« Supper; which isnifually perfortn'd 
by help of an artificial Catalogue bf Sins methodically coU 
la£led out of the Ten CommandmentSi according to 
which Catalogue fet Forms of Con feflfions are drawn up, 
which the Preparant is to take upon Content, and without 
any foit of Judgmtnt or Difcretion of his own, he con* 
k&s himfelf guilty of all the Sins therein mentioned, to- 
gether with all their Aggravations, tho*, it may be, ntiany 
of them were of fuch a heinous Nature as never enter'd 
into his Heart to commit. And if thefe Catalogues and 
confedional Forms are read over once a Quarter of a Year, 
or, it may be, once a M<HKh againft che ufual Sacrament-^ 
Day, the Work of Preparation is thought to be well pafs'd 
met. 

But fiire it is better to keep a conftant cuftomary WatcH 
over qurfelves, and upon the firft Difcovery of any evil De* 
%n or Action, immediately to retrafl it within our own 
Hearts, as in the Prefence of God, and by mental Prayer, 
proper to the Occafion, arm outfelves againil committing 
the like for the fiiture. Hereby you diS:harge a Duty in 
its proper Seafbn, which is better than to delay it to a pre^ 
fyfd Diflance of Time ; for what is moft fiefii in Memo^

in a little time be forgotten. Befides, we are apt to turn 
Forms into Formalities ; and a natural Difcharge of religi- 
ous Duties muft be more improving than an artificial one, 

A ferious well-incUn*d Temper of Mind is certainly the 
beft Preparation for the Lord's Supper, or any other of 
the Ordinances of Jefus Chrift, that we may partake of 
'em with Advantage arid Delight. 

. D^wVadvifes us to delight durfelyes in the Lord, . /. e. in 
all his Ways and Ordinances 5 and there is no Reafonithat- 
our Preparation for the Lord's TaSle; and Participation 
at it, fliould be accompany'd with greater Ai>xieties of 
Mind, than our communicating in any other holy Office; 
fuch as pubFick Prayer or Preaching. We exped the fime 
Bleifing of God in the Improvement of our Virtues from 
all of thefe Ordinances alike. And why with Terror up- 
on our Minds we fhould ufe any of thofe Means which 
God has ordain'd for our Good, i« not eafy to be under- 
wood. A Man indeed ought to perform every religious Of- 
fice ferioufly and foberly 5 but Fear, by amufing and dif- 
trading the Mind, is apt to render the Ordinance unprofi- 
table. 

Men ought likewife to be difcourag'd from coming to 
Prayer, Preaching or Communicating atthe Lord's Table, 
witn. a carele&, or profane Temper of Mind ; becaufe 
^ch Unpreparednels does harden Men's Hearts, and ren- 
ders the Ordinance unprofitable. Such as this was the 
Cafe of the Corinthians ^ who in celebrating the Lord's 
Supper, were fo inconfideratc of what they came to do, 
that fome were drunk at the Lord's Table, as you read, 
a Con xi. 2 1. For in eating every one taketb before other 
his own Supper j and one is hungry^ and another is drunken 5

and to this their prophane Behaviour, thofe Texts of Scrip- 
ture do particularly rdate, which affright fotne Men from, 
and others in reteiving the Sacrament : On this Account 
'twas (aid, by St. Paiiiy That they were guilty of the Body 
and Blood of Chrijl ; and to eat and drink Damnation to 
tbemjelvesy not di/cerning the Lords Body^ ven 27, 29. 
i. e, by fucb a profane and unworthy Communicatiug, they 
call down GodV Judgments upon themieives ; for fb the 
Word Damnation ought to be underftood, becaufe it refers 
to the Judgments fpecify'd in the following Verie, where 
'tis iaid« that. For this Caufe (viz. of drunken Commu- 
nicating) many are weak and fickly among you^ and many 
fiiep^ i. e. die^ ver. ^}o. Now to avoid thefe Judgments 
he exhorts them to examine themfelves, /. e. to coniider 
ynnltk themfelves what was the meaning of that Duty which 
they were to per fo i'ui at the Lord's Table, which Duty 
was this, viz. to call to mind the Death of Jefus Chrift. 
And this Coipme^^oo is by St« Paul ftil'd, Difcerning 
the Lord's 6ody. '' ' 

The vifible Signs of our Saviour's Death, which we 
diicern on the Lord's Tabl&, :do prepare our Minds to 
contemplate a divine Perfbn, who for his great Charity to 
the ftupid World, fiifier'd the^highefl: Injuftice, with iuch 
an invincible Patience, and Heroick Fortitude, as v^s iii-

ietting before ass the brighteft Example of an unfhakea 
Reiblutioh to do Good in fpigbt of all Difcouragements.

Deral Influence, does not only ballaft the Mind with ibber 
and. faunShle llioughts of qurielves, but alio ftecrs every 
Part of the outward Frame. It appears in the Face in 
calm and meek Looks, where it fo imprefles itfelf, that it 
feems thcBce. to hafie acqmrdd the Name of Sbamefac dnefs. 
Certaiitly, whatever the modern Opinion may be, there is 
odtfatng which gives a greater Lb Are to a Feminine Beauty.

imaginable ; and fo rude an impofing on Company, that 
there can fi:arce be a greater Indecency in Converiation. 
This is ingeniouily expreis'd by our divine Poet Herbert. 

A civil Gueft 
Will no more talk all^ than eat aU the Feafi. 

He that ingrof&s the Talk enforces Silence upon the 
reft, and fo is prefumed to look on them only as his Audi* 
tors and Pupils, whiift he magifterioufly didbates to them ; 
which gave Occafion to Socrates to fay. It is Arrogance to 
jpeak all^ and to be willing to bear nothing. It is indeed 
univerfaliy an infblent unbecoming thing, but moft pecu-- 
liarly fo in a Woman. 

The ancient Romans thought it (b much fo, that they 
allowed not that Sex to fpeak publickly, tho* it were in 
their own necei&ry Defence ; infomuch that when Amefia 
ftood forth to plead her own Cauie in the Senate, they 
looked on it as fo prodigious a thing, that they feht to 
confult the Oracle what it portended to the State. And 
tho' theie firft Sevei ities were foon loft in the Succeffes of 
that Empire, Valerius Maximus could find but two more, 
whofe either Neceflity or Impudence perfuaded them to 
repeat this unhandfbme Attempt 

Befides this affiiming Sort ot Talkativeneis, there is an-* 
other ufually charged upon the Fair Sex, a meer chatting, 
prattling Humour, which maintains itielf at the Coft of 
their Neighbours, and can never want Supplies as long as 
there is any body within the Reach of their'Ob&rvation. 
This, it is to be hoped, is chiefly the Vice of the vulgar. 
Sort of Women, the Educatioa of the Nobler letting them

Tie 'whole Duty of a Woman. 23 

above thofe mean Entertainments, Yet when it is remem* 
bered that St. P^W makes Tatling the Effe6t of Idlenefs, 
it may not unreafonably be feared, that where there is moft 
of the Caufe, there will be feme of the EfFedt. And, in- 
deed, it would puzzle one to conjedture, how that Round 
of formal Vifits among Perfons of Quality (hould be kept 
up without this. That their Vifits fhould be only a dumb 
Snew, none will ftifpedl among Women ; and when the 
unfafhionable Themes of Houfcwifry, Piety, &c. are ex- 
cluded, there will not remain many Topicks of Diicourfe, 
unlefs this be called in for a Supply, and this, indeed, is a 
moft inexhauftible Referve, it having fo many Springs to 
feed it, that it is icarce poflible it Thould fail y yet how 
careful ought the Fair Sex to be of giving way to this Vice, 
which is not only immodeji^ but diredly oppofite to all the 
Obligations of Juflice and Charity, which are fcarce fo 
frequently violated by any thing, as by this Licentioufnefs 
of the Tongue. 

. Such a degenerate Age do we now live in, that every 
thing ieems inverted, even Sexes, whilft Men fall into the 
EflFeminacy and Nicenefs of Women, atfd Women take up 
the Q>nfidence, the Boldnefs of Men, and this too under 
the Notion of good Breeding. A Blufh, which was for- 
merly accounted the Colour of Virtue, is now looked on 
as worie Manners than thofe Things which ought to oc- 
cafion it. And not only the Air but Vices of Men are 
carefully copied by Ibme Women, who think they have 
not made a Sufficient Efcape from their Sex, till they can 
be as daringly wicked as the other. A fober modeft Dia*^ 
]t& is too effeminate for them s a bluflring ranting Stil& is 
takeja up, and, to fhew them Proficients in it,, adorned 

with

with all the Oaths and Imprecations their Memory or In- 
vention, can fupply^ as if they meant to vind!ca*:c their 
Sex from the Imputation of Timeroufnefs by daring the 
Almighty : And when to this a Woman adds the Vice of 
Drankcnnefe, nothing that is human approaches fo near the 
Beaft. She who is firft Proftitute to Wine, will foon be 
' fo to Luft alfo : She has difmifs'd her Guards, difcarded all 
the Suggeftions of Rcafon, as well as Grace, and is at the 
Mercy of any, nay, every AfTailant : And unle& her Victf 
fccure her Virtue, and the Loathfomenefs of the one pre-^ 
vent Attsempts on the other, it is fcarce imaginable a Wo- 
man who lofes her Sobriety (hould keep her Chaftity, If 
we coniider Modefty in this Senfe we (hall find it the moft 
indifpen&ble Requifite of a Woman ; a Thing fo eflTential 
and natural to the Sex, that every the leaft I>eclinatioii 
from it, is a Proportionable receding from Womanhood. 
This Virtue is fo much an Inftioft of Nature, that tho* 
too many makea (hift to fupprefs it in themfelves, yet they 
cannot fo darken the Notion in others, but that an impu- 
dent Woman is looked upon as a fort of Monfter, a thing 
diverted and diftorted firom its proper Form. That there is 
indeed a ftrange Repugnancy to Nature, needs no other 
Evidence, than the ftruggling and Difficulty in the firft Vi- 
oktions of Modefty, which always begin with Regret* 
and Blufhes, and require a great deal of Self-Denial, much 
of vicious Fortitude, to encounter with the Recoilings and 
Upbraidings of their own Minds. Such are the Horrors 
and Shames that precede thofe firft Guilts, that they muft 
commit a Rape upon themfehres, force their own Rekiftan-i^ 
ces and Averfions, before they can become willing Prcrfti- 
ttites tor others. This their Seducers feem v^ td 'under--

Privacies, none of them all being to be difpleafed for fear 
of blabbing : And when it is remembred, what Sort of 
Cattle they are, which are commonly the Engines in fuch 
A&irs, there can fcarce be any thing more deplorable

of the Sex, to love Gaiety, and a fplendid Appearance^ 
which renders all Temptations of that Sort fo connatural

Were this Diftance to be duly obfcrved, it might be

Senfe of Solon ^ the wife Athenian l^w-giver, who, be- 
fides that he fhqt the Temple DoQrs againft them, in- 
terdided them the iQicred Anemblies, made it one of his 
Laws, that an Adultrefs (hould not be permitted to wear 
any Ornaments, that fo they might in their Drefs cAxry 
the Note of their Infamy. Should we ha?6 the Hke 
Diftin(fiion.obfervcd, it is to be feared that many of our 
gayeft Birds would l>e unplumed: And the' the £ime be^ 
not now an Expedient prad:icable, yet the former is, and 
might be ,of very good Ufe, For befides that already men- 
tioned o£ fecuring the Innocent, it might, perhaps, have a 
good E&d: on the Guilty, who could not but refledt with 
fome Shame on themfelves, if they were thus fingled out 
and difcriminated : Whereas, whilft they arc fullered to 
mix with the beft Societies, like hurt Deer in an Herd, 
they flatter themfelves they are undifcernable. 

But indeed the Advantage of this Courfe is yet more 
exteniive, ^nd would reach the whole Sex, which now 
feems to lie' under a general Slander, for the Faults of par-- 
ticular Perfons, We know any confiderable Number of

yet were they apart, would, perhaps, not fill a fmall

fo great a Noife : Befides this there can be but one more 
Way fuggefted for Women of Honour to vindicate their 
Sex, and that is, by making their own Virtue as illuftri- 
pu5 aS^they can ; and by the bright Shine of that, draw ofF 
Mens Eyes from the worfer Profpeft; and to this there 
is required not only Innocence, but Pradence, to abftain 
as from all real Evil, fo from the Appearance of it too 5 not 
by any doubtful or foipicious Adion, to give Umbrage 
for Cenibre, but, as the Apoftle lays, in another Cafe, 7i 
cut off Occalim from them that defire Occafion-^ to deny 
themfelves the moft innocent Liberties when any fcaiMlalous 
Inference is like to be deduc'd from them: And tho' per- 
haps no Caution is enough to fecure againil the Malicious

If their Lives be fuch, that they may acquit themfelves

can be alpired to in this World 5 the more evincing At-

But notwithftanding what has been faid of Modefty, 
let not a Woman think that her whole Virtue depends 
on that only; theite* are fdme Women, who know no 
other, and are perliiaded, - that in this, they acquit all the

Compofition of Body, infers thereby her Intention, that 
the Mind (hould correfpond with it. For tho' the Adul- 
terations of Art can reprefent in the fame Face Beauty 
in one Pofition, and Deformity in another, yet, Nature 
is more fincere, and never meant a ferene and clear Fore- 
head (hould be the Frontifpiece to a cloudy tempefluous 
Heart 'Tis, therefore, to be wifti'd they would take the 
Admonition, and, whilft they confult their Glalles, whe- 
ther to applaud or improve their outward Form, they 
would caft one Look inwards, and examine what Sym- 
metry is there held with a fair Outfide, whether any Storm 
of Paffion darken and overcaft their interior Beauty, and 
uie, at leafb, an equal Diligence to refcue that, as they 
would to clear their Face from any Stain or Blemifli. 

But it is not Nature only which luggefts this, but the 
God of Nature too, Meeknefi being not only recommend- 
ed to all as a Chriftian Virtue, but particularJy enjoin'd 
to Women as a peculiar Accompliftiment of their Sex,

Now, tho' Meeknefe be in itfelf a fingle entire Virtue, 
yet, it is diverfify'd according to the feveral Faculties of

have given of unruly Wills, is not eafy to determine 5 but, 
either Way, it is fo great a Reproach as they (hould be 
Tcry induftrious to wipe off. Ana, truly, there can be no 
ftronger Incentive to that Endeavour, than having a right 
Eilimate of the Happ&nefs, as well as Virtue, of a govern* 
able Will: How calmly do thofe glide thro' all, even the, 
isQughefty Events, that can but mafler that ftubborn Fa-j 
cul^ ? A Will reined to God's, how does it enervate and 
en£»>le any Calamity ? Nay, indeed, it triumphs over it, 
and by that Conjun^ion with him that ordams it, may 
be laid to conAn^nc), even, what it fufiers. It was a Phi- 
lofbphical Maxim, that a wiie moral Man could not be 
ii^«ed, could not be miferable. But, fure it is much 
more true of him who has that divine Wifdom of Chri-

. Proportionable, tho' not equal to this, is the Happinef«

It is the Diguty pf human Nature, and that which di-- 
fttngutfhes it from that of Beafts. And^ even thofe grow 
the more contmiiitible in the Kinds, the farther they are 
removed from it.

headlong to Deftrudtion 5 and, yet, deprives one of that poor 
Referve, that faint Comfort of the Miferable, Pity, which 
will not be fo much invited by the Mifery, as averted by 
that Wilfulnefs which cauied it : Nay, indeed, fo little can 
liich Perfons expedt the Compaffion of others, that 'twill 
be hard for them to afford themfelves their own : The 
Confcioufnefs that their Calamities are but the Iflues of 
their own Perverfnefs, being apt to difpofe them more 
to Hate than Pity. And, this is no fmall Accumulation 
of Wretchednefs, when a Man fuffers not only dircdly, 
but at the Rebound too ; reinflidts his Miferies upon him-' 
felf, by a grating Refleftion on his own Madnefs, Yea, 
fo great an Aggravation is it, that even Hell itfelf is en- 
hanced and compleated by it; all the Torments there, 
being edg'd and (harpned by the woful Remembrance, that 
they might once have been avoided. 

In the laft Place, a Will duly fubmiflive to lawful Supe« 
riors, is not only an amiable thing in the Eyes^ of others, 
but exceedingly happy to one's felf; it is the Parent of 
Peace, and Order both public and private.- A Blefiln^

And as a Will thus refigned to Reaibn and juft Authority, 
is a Felicity all rational Natures (hould afpire to, (o ef^ 
pccially the Feminine Sex, whole Paflions being naturally 
the more impetuous, ought to be the more ftriftly guard- 
ed and kept under the fevere Difcipline of Reaton ; for 
where it is otherwife, where a Woman has no Guide but 
her Will, and her Will is nothing but her Humour, the 
Event is fure to be fatal to herfelf, and often to others 
alfo. 

And the Hazard of this renders that other Reftraint of 
the Will, viz. that of Obedience to Superiors, a very hap- 
py Impofition, tho', perhaps, it is not always thought fo j 
for thofe who refift the Cfovernment of Rcafon, are not 
very apt to fubmit to that of Authority., Yet, fixre God 
and Nature do atleft the particular Expediency of this to 
Women, by having placed that Sex in a Degree of In^ 
feriority to .the other. Nay, farther, 'tis obfervable, that 
as there are but three States of Life, thro' which they 
can regularly pafs, viz. Virginity, Marriage, and Widow- 
hood, two of them are States of Subjedion, the Firft to 
the Parent, the Second to the Husband, and the Third, as 
it is cafual, whether ever they arrive to it or no, fo if 
they do, we find it, by God himfclf,. reckoned as a Con- 
jditjon the moft defolate and deplorable. If we fhould fay, 
this happens upon that very Score^ that they are left to 
their own Guidance, the fad Wrecks of many would too 
much juftify the Glofs: But^ however, it evinces, that 
God fets not the fame Value upon their being Mafterlefs, 
.which fome of them do, whilft he reckons them moft 
miierable when they are moft at Liberty^ 

And

And fince God's Aflignation has thus determined Subjedti^ 
on to be the Women's I^ot, there needs no other Argument 
of its Fitncfs, or for their Acquiefcence : Therefore, when- 
ever they oppofe it, the Contumacy flies higher than the 
immediate Superior, and reaches God himfelf : And it is 
likely that there would not many of that timorous Sex 
dare fo far, were it not for fome falfe Pun<9:illio's of Honour, 
which, like thofe among ourDuellifts, they haveimpofed 
upon themfelves. Thefe reprefent Meeknefs and Submiflion 
as 4 filly (heepiih Quality unfit for Women of Breeding and 
Spirit ; whilA an imperious Obftinacy paffes for Nobkncft 
and Greatnefs of Mind : But, alafs ! they are wofully 
miftaken in their Notion of a great Spirit, which confifts 
in fcorning to do unworthy and vile Things, and couragi- 
oufly encountring the adverfe Events of Lite, not in fpurn- 
ing at Duty, or fecking to pull themfelves fi"om that Sphere 
where the divine Wifdom has placed them. No fiire, 
Stubbornnefs is the Mark only of^ a great Stomach, not of 
a great Mind ; and the Cruelty of a Coward may as well 
denominate him valiant, as the Ungovernablenefs of a Wo- 
man can Ipeak her generous. 

This may be prefiimed to be the common Senfe of all, 
for what Value foever they put upon themfelves, nothing 
tenders them left acceptable to others; an imperious Wo- 
man bemg a Plague to her Relatives, and a Derifion to 
Strangers, yea, and a Torment to herfelf ; every the lead 
Contradid:ion,* vvhich a tncek Perfon would pafs over in-

And what is thus univerfally unbecoming to human Na- 
ture, cannot fure be Icfs indecent for the gentler Sex : It is 
rather more fo, every thing contraSing to much more of 
Deformity, by how much it recedes from its proper kind. 
Now Nature nath befi'iended Women with a more cool and 
temperate Conftitution, put Icfs of Fire, and confequently 
of Choler, in their Compofitibns ; fo that their Heats of 
that kind are adventitious and preternatural, raifed often 
by Fancy or Pride, and fo both look more unhandfbmely, 
and have Icfe of Pretence to veil and cover them. Befides, 
Women have a native Feeblenefs, unable to back and ai^

that Paffion, which Nature feems by tnat very Inability to

more ridiculoufly hateful, than an impotent Rage.

wbich as 'tis always ready, (o proves often troublefonie.' 
viz. the Tongue, which, tho' in its loudeft Clamours can 
naturally invade nothing but the Ear, yet, even that is a 
M(deftation. The Barking of a Dog, tho' we are fecure 
he cannot bite, is a grating unpleafant Sound, and while 
Women feek that way to vent their Rage, they are but a 
ibrt of ipeaking Brutes, and fhould conlider whether that 
do not refledfc more Contempt upon themielves, than their 
moft virulent Reproaches can fix upbn others. 

But fimie Things have had the Luck to acquire a For* 
midablenefs no body knows how : And, fure, there is no 
greater Inftancc of it than in this Cafe. A clamorous Wo- 
man is look'd upon, tho' not with Reverence, yet with 
neuich Doead ; and we often find Things done to prevent 
or appeafe her Slomu, which would be denied to the calm 
and rational Defires of si iiKeker Peribn. And, per-

FeauniDe Vices impartially enough, yet, there is fcarce 
any of them whidb he more often and more feverely

Exercife, than to get a Shrew to his Wife, an Excellence, 
that may, perhaps, again recommend a Woman, when we 
fall to an Age of Philofophers j but, at prefent, it will be 
hard for any of our Xantippes to find a Socrates -, and, 
therefore, that Quality is as deftrudtive to their Interefts in 
getting Hufbands, as it is to the Hufband when he is got. 
Much more need not be izid of this Fault if we were to 
ipeak only to Gentlewomen, for if neither moral nor di- 
vine Confiderations have prevented it; yet probably Civility 
and a genteel Education hath : A Scold being a Creature to 
be look'd for only in Stalls and Markets. Yet if there be 
any, among Women of Fafhion, who have defcended to 
fo fordid a Pradlice, they have fo far degraded themfelves, 
that they are not to wonder if others iubftradl that Refpeft, 
which upon other Accounts they might demand. 

To fuch the ufual Method of Phyfic fliould be recom-* 
mended, which is to cure by Revulfion : They, fhould let 
that (harp Humour which fo habitually flows to the 
Tongue, be taught a little to recoil and work inward ; and 
inflead of reviling others, difcipline and CQrre£t them- 
felves ', let them upbraid their own Madnefs, that to gratis 
fy an impotent, nay, a moft painfol Paflion, have dege- 
nerated from what their Nature, their Qualities, their 
Education, defign'd them : And if they can thus reverfe 
their Difpleafures, 'twill not only iecure others from all 
their indecent AfTaults, but it will at laft extinguiih them. 
For Anger is corrofive, and if it be kept only to feed upon 
itfelf, muft be its own Devourer, if it be permitted to fetch 
no Forage from without, nor to nourifh itfelf with Suipi* 
cions and Surmiies of others, nor to mak^^my Sallies at 
the Tongue, it can not long hold out. '

How much they will herein confult their Intereft and 
their Reputation too, may be taught by Solomon^ who 
makes it the diflinflive Sign of a foolijh Woman^ to be 
clamorous. Prav. ix. 13. Whereas when he gives the 
Charader of his excellent Woman, he links Wifdom and 
Gentleneis together, She openetb her Mouth nvitb Wifdom^ 
Mid in ber Tongue is tbe Lmu of Kindnefs. Prov. xxxi. 26. 
If this Verdidt may be adnodtted, as iiire it ought, whether 
we confider his Wifdom, or dear bought Experience ia 
Womien, it will confute the common Plea of querulous 
Spirits, who think to ieem inienfible of any the lead Pro^ 
vocation, is to appear iilly and ftupid ; tho' truly if it were 
fo, it would be full as eligible as to appear mad and ravings 
as they commonly do in the Transport of their Fury. 

To conclude, Meeknefs is fo amiable, io endearing a 
Quality, and io peculiarly embelliihing to Women, that 
did they but all confider it with half the Attention they do

them; many. Sins being committed, even, againft the 
Grain, and with Violence to Conftitution. 

Yet, Sectrndfyj "Tis not a meer melting of the Eyes, or 
yearning of the Bowels we would recommend : Alafs, their 
Tears will not be Drink to a thirfly Soul, nor will (hiver- 
ing at his Nakednefe doath him 5 this is an infignificant 
Mercy : She who weeps over thofe Diftreflcs (he will not

more adive Scwt of Gdmpaffion to which we would invite 
them; and, yet, fdr Method's Sake, we fhallconfider it 
under two <lKiin<% Heads, Giving and Forgiving: 

By Giving, in this Place, is meant, not a general Libe- 
naiityy tho'^ that prwkntly bounded, is an Exceltehce well 
becociring Pcrfons of Fortune, but only fuch a Giving, 
as tertiiiftates upon tbe Needy, and is appJyed to fuccour

men, Prov. xxxi. 20. She ftretcbetb forth her Hand to 
the Poory and reacheth her Hand to the Needy : And it is' 
a little obfervable, that after he ha^ defcribed her Induftry 
and Diligence for the acquiring of Wealth, this is fet in 
the Front of her Disburfements as the principal Ufe (he 
made of it ; and precedes her providing Scarlet for her Houf- 
hold, or fine Linnen and Purple for herfelf, v. 21, 22. 
The Application is very obvious, and admoniflies all that 
own the iamc Title of virtuous Women, to prefer the 
Neceflities of others before their own Superfluities and 
Delicacies : Nay, if they look further, and confider who 
it is that is perfonated in the Poor, that begs in every needy. 
diftrefTed Suppliant, and that will finally own every AA 
of Mercy as aone to himfelf $ methinks they (hould fome* 
times think fit to facrifice, even, their moft moderate En- 
joyments to their Charity, be afhamed to ferve themfelves 
before their Saviour, or let him ftand naked and hungry, 
whilft they are folacing with that which would relieve him. 
But how then (hall they .anfwer it, who fuiFer him to 
be fupplanted, not by their Needs, but ExcefTes, who have 
fo devoted their Hearts and Purfes to Vanity and Luxury, 
that they have neither Will nor Power tp fuccour the 
Wants of others ? How unequal and diiprdportionate is it, 
that thole, vfho ftudy to fling away Money upon them* 
felves, cannot be tempted, by any Importunity and 
Diflre^, to drop an Alms to the Poor ? Wh^t a prepofte-

But, lure, fuch Pcrfons do it, if the Poor happen Hot to 
have more Charity than they exemplify to them : For 
when they {hall find fuch nard Hearts under fuch foft 
Raiment, fee them beftow fo much upon the decking their 
own Bodies, and nothing towards the neceflary Support of 
theirs, 'tis a (hrewd Trial of their Meckneis, Poverty is apt 
of itfelf to imbitter the Spirit, and needs not fuch an ad^ ^ 
' ditional Temptation. 

Nay, farther, when a poor ftarving Wretch (hajl look 
upon one of thefe gay Creatures, and fee that any one of 
the Baubles, the loofefl: Appendage of her Drefs, a Fan, 
a Busk, perhaps a black Patch, bears a Price that would 
warm his empty Bowels ; will he not have iharp Incitati- 
ons not only to eacecrate her Pride and his own Poverty, 
but confequently to repine at the unequal DiAribution of 
Providence, and add Sin to his Mifery ? The Denial, there- 
fore, of an Alms may be a double Cruelty to the Soul as 
well a8 to the Body. It is iaid of Xenocrates^ that a chafed 
Bird flying to his Bofbm, he refcued it with much Satis* 
fit^ipn, faying, He b^d not betrayed a Suppliant ; but this 
is in that Cafe rev^rfe^ a,nd in a higher In fiance; for what 
can be more the betraying a Suppliant, than inflead of fup- 
plying his Wants, to rob him of his Innocence, he his 
Snare in lieu of hi^ Refuge ? This is a Confideration that 
it were to be wifhed, were more deeply impreis*d upon the 
Women of this Age 5 and truly 'tis their Concern it fhould 
be fo, for fince at the lafl Day: the Inquefl fhail be fo par* 
ticular upon this very thing, 'tis but neceflary they fhould 
examine how thcty are fitted to pa& that Tef):.

Hypocrifes of their Drefs, in falfe Hair, [and Complexion, 
has coft them ; to which they may alio add the Charge of 
their Recreations and Divertifemcnts, thofe coftly Arts of 
chafing away that Time, which, they will one Day wifli 
to recall. Let them, we fay, compute all this, and then 
confront to it the Account of their Qiarity, and much, 
it is to be feared, the latter will, with many of them, be 
comparatively as undifcernable as Socrates found Akibi^ 
adei% Land, in the Map of the whole World, and be fo 
perfectly overwhelmed, that it willappear> little in their 
own Sight, and nothing in God's. 

For if the poor Widow*s Mite acquired a Value, merdy 
from her Poverty, that fhe had no more ; by the Rule ot 
Contraries we may conclude, how defpicable the fcanty 
Oblations of the Rich are in God's Account. If even 
their Liberality who gave much, was outvied by a Far* 
thix^, Mank xii. 41. to what Point of Dimunition muft 
their niggardly Ororings, wiw) give little, be reduced ? es- 
pecially when they fhall be compared with the numerous 
and coflly Sacrifices they made to Pride and Luxuty. 
Nay, perhaps, fome have been guilty of more than the 
Di4>roportion, even the total Omiffion of Charity, that 
in a Multitude of Taylors Bilk casnnot produce tne Ac« 
count of one 'Garment for the Poor, that amidfl the De- 
licacies of their own Diet ; nay, perhaps, of their Dogs

Were thefe Confiderations duly laid to heart,' wc might 
hope to fee fbme of the Primitive Charitv revive, when 
Women of the higheft Rank converted their Ornaments 
and coftly Deckings into Cloathing for the Poor, and 
thought no Retinue fo defirable, fo honourable, as a Train 
of Alms-folks : But it is fpeaking improperly, to make the 
Poor their Attendants, for, indeed, they rather attended 
the Poor, did not only order the Supply of their Wants, 
but were themfelves their Minifters, waited about their 
fick Beds, drefsM their moft loathfome. Ulcers, and de- 
fcended to all the moft fervile Offices about them. 

But thefe were fuch heights, fuch Tranfcendencies of 
Mercy, as required a deeper Foundation of Humility than' 
will now be often met with ) yet, let us take the Occafion 
to fay; that it may be a good Managery of a Charity to 
a6t (as far as they can) perfonally in it. For .befides that," 
it prevents fome Abufes and Frauds, which deputfcd Agents

For Things arc bcft illuflrated by their Contraries, and 'tis 
too obiervable in our depraved Nature, that we value not 
Things by their real poutivc Worth, but comparitively as 
they excel others, nor ever make a right Eftiinlte of vrhat 
wc cnjc^, till our own, or others Wants inftruft us. 

Upon all thefe Confiderations it may be a very becom- 
ing ufefiil CircumAance in any charitable Miniftry to be 
themfelves the Aftors 5 and to that End 'twill be a very 
commendable Induilry, to qualify themfelves to be helpful 
to the Poor in as many Inftances as they can, not only 
opening their Purfes, but Difpenfatories too 5 providing 
Medicines for fuch, as, either by Difeafe, or Cafualty, want 
that Sort of Relief. 

Befides this Part of Mercy in Giving, there is another, 
that of Forgiving, which may happen to be of a larger 
Extent than the former ; for whereas that was confin'd to 
the Poor, this has no fuch Limits, but as it is poflible to 
be injured by Perfons of all Ranks, fo this pardoning Mer- 
cy is to reach equally with that Poflibility. This is that 
Part of Charity which we peculiarly call Clemency, a Vir- 
tue which not only Chriftianity but Morality recommends. 
The Ancient Romans had it in fiich Veneration, that they 
number'd it not only among Virtues but Deities, and built 
it a Temple : And tney were fomewhat towards the Right 
in it, for it was, tho* not God, yet fo eminent an Attribute 
of his, that nothing can niore adimilateMan unto him. 

There are many heroic Adts of this Kind to be met with 
among the virtuous Heathens. Lycurgus not only forgave 
Alexander who had ftrucjc out his Eye, but entertain'd him 
in his Houfe, and by his gentle Admonitions reclaimed him 
from his former vicious Life. Arijlides being, after fignal

he fhould never revenge him, A multitude of the like tx-

from their faint Tapers, when we have the Sun-beams of 
Righteoufnefs, our bleffed Saviour, who, as he has recom- 
friended this Grace by his Precept, fo he has fignally eyeiti- 
plified it to us in his Pradrce ; the whole l5elign of his^ 
Defcent to Earth being only to refcue hrs Enemres from:

frequent Inftances of the implacable Malice and in&tiable

be fuborn'd to foment it with new Sufpicions, till at laftit 
grow to a Q^rrel, from thence to Hatred, from that to 
Malice, and from that to Revenge: And when that black 
PafTion has pvcr-fpread the Mind, like an Egyptian Dark- 
nefs, it admits no Gleam of Reafon or Religion, but hur-« 
ries the Enraged blindfold to their own Ruin often, as well 
as others. 

Every one ought to confider at the firft Incitement to 
Wrath, what is the real Ground of it : Perfons are fome- 
times angry, perhaps, becaufe fcandalous, or at leaft fuf-» 
picious Behaviour, may have engaged a Friend to admonifh 
them, an Office that has fometimes proved very fatal ; 
thoie commonly that have mofl Guilt having lefs Patience 
to hear of it : And if this be the Cafe, it is the greateft In- 
juftice in the World to make that a Quarrel which is really 
an Obligation : And, therefore, inftead of maligning their 
Monitor, they ought to thank and reverence him. Nay, 
tho' the Accufation be not with that candid De^gn, but 
be meant as a Reproach, yet, if it be true, it (hould not 
excite Anger at their Accufers, but Remorfe and Reforma-- 
tion in themielves. 

It was the Saying of a Wife Man, Tiat be profited more 
by bis EnemieSy tban bis Friends ; becaufe tbey would tell 
him roundly of bis Faults. And this is excellently improv- 
ed by Plutarcb in his Traft, Of tbe Benefits to be reafd 
from Enemies : So that even a malicious Accufation may 
be a Kindne^, and confequently ought not to be, repaid 
with an Injury : But fuppofe, in the laft PUce^ that the 
Afperiion be not only unkind, but untrue, it wiU not even 
then be fafe to let loofe to their Indignation* Firfi^ in

rcfpdl of Pradcncc, an angiy Vindication ferving the De-» 
fign of the Enemy, and helping to fpread the Calumny ; 
\^hereas, a wife Negledt and Difiembling does often ftifle 
and fupprefs it. Secondly y In re^£t of Duty, for all that 
own themfclves Chriftians muft confeis, they are under an 
Obligation to forgive and not to revenge. Now if they 
intend to pay a real Obedience to this Precept, ^twill be 
the more eafy the fooncr they fct to it. He . that fees his 
Houfe on fire, will not dally with the Flame, much le& 
blow, or extend it; refblving to quench it at laft : And 
Anger is as little to be trufted, which if once throughly 
kindled, • will fearce expire but with the Deftm£tion of 
the Subjedt it works on. 

Let, therefore, the Difobliged not look back upon . the 
Injury, but forward to thofe Mifchiefs which too (harp a 
Referitment may betray them too: Let them confider, that 
the boiling of tneir Blood may finally caufe the Effiifion 
of another's, and Wrath may fwell into Murder. If they 
woiild do thus, aJid inilead of thofe magnifying Optics 
wherein they view the Wrong, make Ufe of the other 
End of the Per^ftive, to difcern this difmal Event at 
Diftance, it would fure fright them from any nearer Ap- 
proach, would keep them within thofe Bounds which their 
Duty prefcribes them, and thereby acquaint them with a 
much greater, and more ingenious Pleafure, than their 
highcfl Revenge can give them, viz. that of forgiving In- 
juries, and obliging the Injurious. This is a Pleafure fo 
pure and refined, fo noble and heroic, that none but ra- 
tional I>Ja{ures are capable of it; whereas, that of Spight 
^d lUveij^ge, if it can be called a Pleafure, is a meer be-

AFfability wd Courtefy, are, without doubt, amiable 
io all, but more cipecially in the Fair Sex, and morp 
necef&ry to them than to the other ; for Men have often 
Charges an4 Employments which juftify, nay, perhaps, 
require ipm^what of St^rnnefs and Auflerity, but Womei;i 
ordinarily have few or no Occafion3 of it, and thoie who 
luive wf U dig^fted the former Lectures of Meeknefs and 
Compailion, will not be apt to put it on unneceffarily. 
Now Afiability may be conudered either as a meer human 
Accomplifhoient, or as a divine Virtue ; in either Notion 
it is commendabk, but it is the latter that gives it the high-^ 
eft Excdlence and Perfection. 

To begin with the firft Notion of it, we may make an 
Eftimate of its Worth by its Caufe, and by its Eflfeds. 
For its Cauie, it derives itfelf either from a native Candour 
and Generofity of Mind, or from a noble and ingenious 
Sdueation, or ibmething jointly from both ; and thefe are 
as good Originals as any Thing meerly moral can flow 
from : And that thefe are, indeed, its Sources common 
Experience will atteft : Thofe of the greateil Minds, and 
ben £xtra<^pns, being ufually moil condeicendine and 
obliging; whereas, thofe of moil abject Spirits and %irth» 
uc we moft infuking and imperious. Alexander the Great, 
tkisf terrible in the Field, yet, was of a gentle complaiiant 
C6nTer&tipn> jfoijuliarly treating thofe about him: Yet, 

H Crifpinus^

CriJpinuSi Narcifus^ Nympbidtus^ and other eftfranchifed 
Bond-men, we find infolcntly trampling on the Roman 
Senators and Confuk. *Tis, therefore, a great Error for 
Perfons of Honour to think they acquire a Reverence by 
putting on a fupercilious Gravity, looking coiiy and difdain- 
fully upon all about them ; 'tis fo far from that, that it 
gives a Sufpicion that 'tis but a Pageantry of Greatncfs, 
ibme Mufhroom newly fprung up that (lands fo ftifF, and 
fwells fo much : But inflead of teaching others to keep 
their Diftance, this faftidious Difdain invites them to a 
clofer Infpeftion, that if there be any Flaw, either in their 
Life or Birth, 'twill be fure to be difcovered, there being 
no llich prying Inquifitor as Curiofity when 'tis egg'd on 
by a Senie of Contempt. 

On the other fide, if we confider the EfFeds of Courteiy, 
they are quite contrary ; it endears to all, and often keeps 
up a Reputation in fpight of any Blemifhesja kind Look or 
Word from a Superior is ftrangely charming, and infenfibly 
fteals away Men's Hearts from them. It is Plutarch*^ Obfer- 
vation of Cleomenes, King of Sparta^ that when the Greci^ 
arts compared his Affability and Eafinefs of Acceis with the 
fullen State and Pride of other Princes, they were (o ena- 
moured with it, that they judged him only worthy to be a 
King : And as there is no certainer, fo alfo no cheaper Way 
of gaining Love. A friendly Salutation is as eafy as a 
Frown or Reproach ; and that Kindnefs may be preferved 
by them, which if once forfeited, will not at a far greater 
Price be recovered. 

Befides, when human Viciflitudes are confidcred, it may 
be a Point of Prudence too j the greateft Perfons may 
fomctimes want Affiftancc from the Meancftj nay, fomc-

times the Face of Afiairs is quite changed, and the Wheel of 
Fortune turns them loweft that were uppermoft, and propor- 
tionably elevates the Meaneft. It is Wifdom, therefore, 
fo to treat alias to leave no Impreffion of Unkindnels, fince 
none is fo defpicablc but may poffibly at one Time or other 
have an Opportunity to retaliate. It was, therefore, a pru- 
dent, as well as an equitable, Refolution of the Emperor, 
who iaid, He wmld Jo entertain the Addrejfes of his Sub-- 
jeSis^ as^ if he were a SubjeSi^ be would wiJJo the Prince 
Jhould entertain him. A Rule very worthy to fway ail Per- 
fons of Honour in their Intercourfes with others ; and fince 
even among Perfons in Command there are Degrees, and 
(he which is fuperior to one, is inferior to another j 
they have a ready way to compare the Civility they pay 
with that they expedt. Let, taerefore, one who meets 
with a cold neglcft Treatment from any iabove her, exa- 
mine her own Refentments, and then refle<a, that if (he 
give the like to thofe below her, they will, doubtlefs, have 
the fame Senie $ and, therefore, let her refolve never to 
ofier what (he fo much diilikes to bear ; and (he that does 
thus, that makes fuch Inferences, will convert an Injury 
into a Benefit ; civilize herfelf by the Rudenefs of others^ 
and make that ill Nurture her own Difcipline. 

But hitherto we confider Affability only in its ethnic 
Dre&, as it is a human Ornament, 'twill appear yet more 
enamouring upon a fecond View, when we look on it as 
bearing the Imprefs of the Sanctuary, as a divine Virtue : 
And that it is capable of being fo, we have the Authority 
of St. FauU who inferts it in the Number of thofe Chri-. 
flian Graces which he recommends to his Roman Pro*

And that wc may the better difcern its Value, 'tis obferv- 
able, that he links it with the moft eminent Virtue of 
Humility ; for it immediately follows his Precept of be not 
high minded. Indeed, 'tis not only joined with as a Friend 
x)r Ally, but derived from it as its Stock and Principal : 
And certainly a more divine Extraftion it cannot have. 
Humility being the Alpha and Omega of Virtues, that 
which lays the Foundation, wichdut which, the tnofb 
towering Strafture will but' crufli itfelf with its own 
Weight, and that which perfedls and confumtoates the Build- 
ing alfo, fccures and crowns all other Graces > which, 
when they are moft verdant and flourilhirtg, are like Jo^ 
nas*s Gourd, that may afford fotne Shadow and Refrefli- 
ment for a while, but are apt to breed that Wornl which 
will deftroy them. When once they are frtlitten with 
Pride they inftantly fade and wither, fo neceflarj^ is Humi- 
lity both for acquiring and confervidg all that is* good In 
us. 

We may, therefore, conclude, that Couftefy and Oblig- 
ingnefs of Behaviour which proceeds thence, is in refpefit 
of its Spring and Original, infihirely to be preferred to 
that which defcends from no higher Stock than ilatural 
or prudential Motives : And fince it is natural for every 
Prciiudlion to have fome Similitude to that which pro- 
duces it, we (hall find it no lefs excdlent in refpedl of its 
Properties than its Defcent. For inftahce only in two. 
Sincerity arid Conftancy. 

For the Fir/y As far as Affability partakes df ttufnilify 
it mitft of Sincerity alfo, that being i Virtue Whofe very 
Elements "are Plainnels and Slniplicity : For as it has no

Defigfls which want a Cover, fo it needs none of thofe 
Subtiltied and Simulations, thofe Pretences and Artifices re- 
quifite to thofe who do. It is the Precept of the Apoftle, 
In Lowlwejs of Mind let each ejleem others better than 
himfelf: Where we fee it is the Nature of a lowly Mind 
to transfer that Eftcem to others which he fiibftra^s from 
himfelf: Now where fuch an Eftcem is planted in the 
Heart, it verifies all the Expreffions and our Significations 
of Refpeft, and renders the gfcateft Condefccntions (which 
to an infolent Humour may feem extravagant and afie€t<* 
ed) real and unfeigned. 

On the contrary, that Courtefy which derives no higher 
than from meer human Principles, is not much to be con- 
fided in. 'Tis the Pfalmift's Affirmation, that all Men are 
Lyars : And, therefore, there is more than a Poffibility 
of D€c6it in their faireft Shews. Sometimes we know 
fmooth and plaufible Addrefles have been defigncd as the 
Stale to vile and treacherous Pradlices. The extraordinary 
Bkiidifhments and endearing Behaviour of Abfolom to the 
People, was only to fteal their Hearts^ and advance his 
intended Rebellion, 2 Sam. xv. and David tells us of

Age has not fo much i&ipfoved in Sincerity, that we fhould 
tWnk the feme Scenes are not daily Aded over among us. 

But befid*s all the blacker Projeds of' this Kind, which 
nothing but the Event can deteft, there is d lower Sort

too frequent among all, but it is to be feared, more par- 
ticularly among Women, thofe, at leaft, of the modi(h 
Sort, their very Civilities and Carefles being often defign'd 
to gain Matter of Scorn and Laughter. Mutual Vifits, 
we know, are an Expreffion of Refpedt, and (hould flow 
from a real Kindnefs, but if thoie now in Ufe be fifted, 
how. few will be found of that Make ? They are at the 
beft but formal, a Tribute rather paid to Cuftom than 
Friendfliip, and many go to fee thofe, for whorp they are 
perfedlly indifferent whether they find them alive or dead, 
well or fick, nay, very often they are virorfe than thus, de- 
iigned only to make Obfervations to bolt out fomething ri- 
diculous wherewith to fport themfeives as foon as they are 
gone ; and leaft the Inqueft (hould return with a Non in-* 
lientusy they will accept of the llighteft Difcoveries, the 
leaft mifolacing of a Word, nay, of a Hair (hall be Theme 
enough for a Comedy. 

But if a poor Country Gentlewoman fall within their 
Circuit, what a Stock of Mirth does fhe afford them, how 
curioufly do they anatomize every Part of her Drefi, her 
Mein, her Dialedt ? nay, perhaps, to improve the Scene, 
will recommend, yet, greater Abfiirdities to her, under the 
Notion of the Mode, that fo fhe may be the more ample 
Subje<9: of their Scorn. Such Vifits as thefe, are but in- 
fiduous Inftradtions of a Spy rather than the good Office 
of a Neighbour, and when it is remembred how great a 
Portion of fbmc Womens Time is Ipent in this Kind of 
Diverfion, we mufl conclude there have a Multitude of 
Ads gone to make up the Habit It were to be wifhed 
they w;oukl ierioufly refledi: on it, and unravel that inju- 
rious Mirth by a penitential Sadnef^ and either fpend their

Time better than in vifiting, or elfc direft their Vifits to 
better Purpofes ; and this they would certainly do if they 
would exchange their meer popular Civilities (that kind of 
Paint and Varnifli in Manners) for that true Cliriflian Con- 
deiceniion, which admits of no Deceit, but is as tranfpa- 
rent as Drufus wifli'd his Houfe (hould be, that has no 
fecret Screws and Springs, to hiove the Eyes or Tongue a 
contrary Way from the Heart, but is in reality all that it 
pretends to be. 

A Second Property of its Conftancy, for as it is trae to 
others, fo it is to itfelf ; *tis founded on the folideft of Vir* 
tues, and is not fobjedt to thofc light and giddy Uncer- 
tainties, that the vulgar Civilities arc : For he, that out of 
a Difeftecra of his proper Worth, has placed himielf in a 
State of Inferiority, will think it not an arbitrary Matter, 
but a juft Debt to pay a Refpedl to thofe he thinks his Bet- 
ters, and an humble Mind will in every body find fome- 
thing or other to prefer to himfelf : So, that he aSs upon 
a fix'd Principle, and is not in Danger of thofe Contradidi- 
ons in his Manners, which fhall render him one Day 
fweet and affable, and another fower and morofc: But 
fiich Changes are fi-equently incident to thofe who arc 
fwayed by other Motives : Sometimes an I^itereft changes, 
iind then the moft fanning Sycophant can tranfplant his 
Flatteries and court a new Patron, yea, many Times to 
the Defpight and vilifying of the Old. 

Sometimes, again. Fortune may change, a Man may 
■fall from a profpcrous to an adverfc State, and, then, thote 
who were prodigal of their Civilities whilft he needed no- 
thing elfc, will withdraw even thofe from him, leaft they 
ihould encourage him to demand fomething nK)re. An

that often, in an Inftant^ they will ihift Paifions^ and

Lev&ty of Mind has been obferved fo incident to Women, 
that 'tis become almoft proverbial ; for by how much their 
Paflions are more violent, they are commonly the lefs laft- 
ing, and as they are reckoned among thofe colder Bodies 
that are particularly influenced by the Moon, fo they feem

gages us to confider tbeie in their proper Order ; that is, 
Firft, 7'be Virgin State-, Secondly, I'he Married \ and 
Laftly, l}>at of fFidowhood: Which as they differ widely 
firom each other, fo for the difcharging their refpedtlve 
Duties, there are particular Cautions worthy to be advert- 
ed to. 

Virginity, or the Virgin-State, is firft in Order, the In- 
fancy and Childhood of which we fhall pafs over, and 
addrefs to thofe who may be fuppofed to be arrived at 
Years of Difcretion, which may be properly reckoned 
about the Age of Sixteen and fo onward. 

An old Maid is now thought fuch a Curie as no Poetic 
Fury can exceed, look'd on ^s the moft calamitous Crea- 
rtue in Nature ; and we fo far yield to the Opinion as to 
a>nfefs it is fo to thofe who are kept in that State again ft 
their Wills ; but, &re, the Original of that Mifery is from 
the Defirc, not tlie Rcftraint of Marriage ; let tnem but 
fupprefsthat once, /and the other will never be their In- 
felicity : But we muft not be fo unkind to the Sex, as to 
think 'tis always fuchPefire that gives them Averfion to 
Celibacy ; we doubt not, many are frighted only with the 
vulgar Contenipt under which t^t State lies ; for which 
if there be. no Cur?, yet, there is the fame Armour again ft 
this, which is againft ail other caufelefs Reproaches, viz. 
to contemn it. Yet, we, are a little apt to believe, there 
may be a Prevention in the Cafe : If the fuperannuated Vir- 
gins would behave ithemfelves with Gravity and Refer- 
vedneis, addi<ft .theipf?lve^ to, the ftri,dteft Virtue and Piety, 
they WQWild givQ' the, ^yorJdf9^xeCaufe to J believe 'twas 
not their Neceflity, but thpir Choice, which kepf them 
unmarried, that they were pre-cngag'd to a better Amour,

efooufed to the fpiritual Bridegroom : And this W6ald give 
them, among the Ibberer Sort, at Icaft, the Reverence and 
Eftecm of Matrons : Or if, after all Caution and Endea- 
vour, they chance to fall under the Tongues of malicious 
Slanderers, this is no more than happens in all other In- 
ftances of Duty: And if Contempt be to be avoided,' 
Cliriftianity itfelf muft be quitted as vrell as Virgin Chafti- 
ty * But if, on the other Side, they endeavour to difguife 
their Age by all the Impoftures and Gaieties of a Youth- 
ful Drefs and Behaviour, if they ftill htxdt themfelves 
among the youngeft and vaineft Company, betrays a young 
Mindln an aged Body, this muft certainly expoie them 
to Scbrh and Ccnfure. If no Play, no Ball or dancing 
Meeting can efcapc them, People will undoubtedly con- 
. elude, that they defire toputoff themfelves, to meet with 
Chapmen, who fo conftantly keep the Fairs. We wifli^ 
therefore, they would more univerfally try the former Ex- 
pediments, which, we are confident, is the beft Amulet 
againft the Reproach they fo much dread, and may alfo 
deliver them from the Danger of a more coftly Remedy, 
we mean, that of an unequal and imprudent Match, which 
many have rufticd upon as they have ran frightened from 
the other, and fo by an unhappy ContradiAioo, do both 
ftay long and marry haftily, gall their Necks to foarc their 
Ears, and run into the Yoke rather than hear fo flight and 
unreafonable a Reproach, They need not be upbraided 
with the Folly or fuch an Eledtion, fince their own Ex-.

in the Difcou^ie, we (hall now addrefs more generally to 
die reft. 

The two grand Elements, eflential to the Virgin State, 
are Modcfty and Obedience, which tho* neceflary to all, 
are, yet, in a more eminent DcgFce required here : And 
therefore, tho' we have fpoken largely of the Virt«e of 
Modefty in the jformer Fart of- this Difcourfe, yet, it will 
not be impertinent to make fbme farther ReflcAiona on it, 
by Way of Applieatidtt to Virgins, in' whom Modefty 
{kcold appear in it^ highefl: Elevation, and (hotild come 
up to Shamefaccdnefs. Her Look, her Speech, her whole 
Beha-vioar fhoitld ow« an humble EXiftruft of herfelf ; Ihe 
is to kx>k on herfelf but as a Novice, a Probationer in the 
Wdrld, and fiinft take this Time rather to leari>and oh* 
ferve, than to diftate and prefcribe. Indeed, there is Icarci 
any thing looks more indecent, than to fee a young Maid 
too forward and- confident in her Talk. 'Tis the Opinion 
of the Wife-men, Eccluf. xxxii. 8. ^hat a young Man 
jbould fiarct fpeaky tM t^vt^e ask'd : In Proportion to ' 
which, 'twill, fore, not become a young Woman, whofe' 
Sex puts her under greater Reftraints, to be either ihipot:^ ^ 
tunate or magifterial in her Difcotirfe : And tljo' that 
which former Ages call JSoldneft, is now only Aflurance- 
alid good Breeding, yet^ we hare feen fuch bad Supci<^ 
ftrufturejr upon that Foundation, as fufe, wiH not miich- 
recomihend it to any cohfidering Pcrfon; 

But there is another Breach of Modefty, as it relates to- 

Chaftity,' in which they are yet more efpecially concerned. 

The very Name pf Virgin umpcrts a m^oft critical Nicenefs 

in- that Peint; ETery-mdeceht Ciiriofity or impure Fancy,'

raption of them gives fome Degrees of Defilement to thtf 
Body too. For between the State of pure immaculate Vir-r 
ginity and arrant Proftitution, there are many intermedial 
StepS)^ and (lie that makes any of them, is fb far departed 
from her firft Integrity.^ She that liftens to any wanton 
^Difcourfe has violated Her Ears, flie that fpeaks any, her 
Tongue 3 every immodeft Glance vitiates her Eye, and 
every the lighted Adt of Dalliance leaves fomething of 
Stain and SuUiage behind it. There is, therefore, a moft 
rigorous Caution requifite herein s for as nothing is more 
clean and white than a perfedl Virginity, fo every the leaft 
Spot or Soil is the more difcernable : Bdddes, Youth is for 
the moft Part flexible, and eafily wraps into a Crookcd- 
nefs, and, therefore, can never fet itieif too iar from a 
Temptation. Our tender Bloflbms we are fain to skreen 
and ftielter, becaufe every unkindly Air nips and deftroys 
them s and nothing can be more nice and delicate than a 
Maiden Virtue, which ought not to be expoied to any of 
thofe malignant Airs which may blaft and corrapt it, of 
which, God knows, there are too many, fome that blow 
from within, and others from without. 

Of the firft Sort, there is none more miichievous than 
Curiofity, a Temptation which foil'd human Nature even 
in Paradiie : And, therefore, fure a feeble Girl ought not 
to truft herielf with that which fubdued her better for- 
tified Parent. The Truth is, an affected Ignorance can- 
not be fo blameable in other Cafes as it is commendable in 
this. Indeed, it is the fureft and moft invincible Guard, 
for fhe who is curious to know indecent Things, 'tis Odds 
but (he will too foon and too dearly buy the Learning. 
The fupprefling and detefting all fuch Curiofities^ is there- 
fore.

fore, that eminent fundamental Piece of Continence we 
would recommend to them, as that which will protC(5t and 
lecure ali the reft. 

But when they have fet this Guard upon themfelves, 
they muft provide againft foreign AfTauIts too ; the moft 
dangerous whereof we take to be ill Company and Idleneis, 
Againft the Firft they muft provide by a prudent Choice 
of Convcrfation, which ftiould generally be of thck own 
Sex 'j yet not all of that neither, but fuch who will atleaft 
entertain them .innocently if not profitably. Againft the 
Second they may fecure themfelvcs by a conftant Series of 
Employments : We mean not fuch frivolous ones as are 
more idle than doing nothing, but fuch as are ingenuous, 
and fome way worth their Time ; wherein as the firft Place 
is to be given to the Offices of Piety, fo in the Intervals 
of thofe, there are divers others, by which they may not 
unufefully fill up the Vacancies of their TimCj fuch are 
the acquiring or any of thofe ornamental Improvements 
which become their Quality, as Writing, Needle-works, 
Languages, Mufick, or the like. If we (hould here in- 
icrt the Art of Oeconomy and Houfliold Managery, we 
fhould not think we affronted them in it \ that being the 
moft proper Feminine Bufinefs, fi-om which neither Wealth 
nor Greatnefs can totally abfolve them : And a little of 
the Theory in their Parents Houfe, would much affift them 
towards the Practice when they came to their own. In a 
Word, there are many Parts of Knowledge ufeful for Civil 
as well as Divine Life j and the improving themfelves in 
any of thofe, is a rational Employment. 

But we know not how to reduce to that Head many 
of thofe Things which from Divertifements, are now ftept

up to be the folemn Bufinefs of many young Ladies, and, 
perhaps, of fomc Old. Such is in the firft Place Gaming, 
a Recreation whofe Lawfulnefs we queftion not, whilft it 
keeps within the Bounds of a Recreation ; but when it fets 
up for a Calling, we know not from whence it derives its 
Licence: And a Calling fure it feems to be with fomc, a 
raboriojis one too, fuch as they toil Night and Day at, 
riayi 2to^. not allow themfelves that Remiflion which the 
Laws, both of God and Man, have provided for the meanefl: 
Mechanic. The Sabbath is to them no Day of Reft, but 
this Trade goes on when all Shops are (hut. We know not 
how they fetisfy themfelves in fuch an habitual Waftc of 
their Time, (befidcs all the incidental Faulte of Avarice and 
Anger,) but we much doubt that Plea, whatfbever it is 
wliich pafles with them, will fcarce hold Weight at his 
Tribunal, who has commanded us to redeem^ not fling 
away our ^ime. 

There is another thing to which fome devote a very 
confiderable Part of their Time,, and that is, the reading 
Romances, which feems now to be thought the peculiar 
and only becoming Study of young Ladies. It muft be 
confcfs^d their Youth may a little adapt it to them when they 
were Children, and we wifli they were always in their 
Event as harmlcfs \ but it is to be feared they often leave 
ill Imprcflions behind them. Thofe amorous Paffions, 
which it is their Dcfign to paint to the utmoft Life, are 
apt to infinuate themfelves into their unwary Readers, and 
by an unhappy Inverfion a Copy jfhall produce an Original.

it a fine thing ; and may rcflefl: how much flie lofes time, 
that has not yet fubdued one Heart : And then her Bufinefs 
will be to fpread her Nets, lay her Toils to catch fome 
body who will more fatally cnfnarc her : And when {he ha$ 
once wound herfelf into Amour, thofe Authors are fubtil 
Cafiiifts for all difficult Cares that may occur in it, will in* 
ftru^t in the neceflary Artifices of deluding Parents and 
Friends, and pat her Ruin perfeftly in her own Power, 
And truly this feems to be fo natural a Confequent of this 
Sort of Study, that of all the Divertiiements that look fo 
innocently, they can fcarce fall upon any more hazardous* 
Indeed, 'tis very difficult to imagine what vail Mifchief is 
done to the World, by the falie Notions and Images of 
things, particularly of Love and Honour, thoje nobleft 
Concerns of human Life repreiented in thefe Mirrors: 
But when we confider upon what Principles the Duellifls 
and Hedtors of the Age defend the Outrages, and how 
great a Devotion is paid to Luft, inilead of virtuous Love, 
we cannot be to ieek for the Gofpel which makes theib 
Do^ines appear orthodox. 

As for the Entertainments which they find abroad, they 
may be innocent, or otherwife, according as they are ma- 
naged. The common Intercourie of Civility is a Debt to 
Humanity, and, therefore, mutual Vifits may often be ne- 
cefiary, and io (in ibme Degree) may be feveral harmleia 
and healthfiil Recreations which may call them abroad^

in ber Houfe ; and 'tis an unhappy Impotence not to be 
able to ftay at home when there is any thing to be feen 
abroad; that any Mask, or Revel, any Jollity of others 
muft be their Rack and Torment, if they cannot get to it. 
Alas, fuch Meetings are not fo fuce to be fafe, that they 
had need be frequent, and they are of all others leaft like 
to be fiife to thofe, who much dote on them : And, there- 
fore, thofe that find they do fo, had need to counterbiafs 
their Minds, and fet them to fomcthing better, and by 
more ferious Entertainments fupplant thofe Vanities, which 
at the beft are childifh, and may often prove worfe, it 
being too probable that thofe Dinahs which are ftill gad- 
ding, tho* on Pretence, only to fee the Daughters of the 
Land, may at laft meet with a Son of Hamor. 

There is alfo another great Devourer of Time fiibfervient 
to the Former, we mean Dreffing ; for they that love to 
be feen much abroad, will be fure to be feen in the moft 
exa<ft Form : And this is an Employment that does not 
ileal but challenge their Time ; what they wafte here is 
cum PriviifgiOy it being, by the Verdidl of this Age, the 
proper Bufinefs, the one Science wherein a young Lady is 
to be perfe(3:ly verfs'd : So that now all virtuous Emulation is 
to be converted into this fingle Ambition, who (hall excel 
in this Faculty : A Vanity which we confefs is more ex- 
cufable in the Youngeft than in the elder Sort; they being 
iuppofable not yet to have outworn the Reliqiies of their 
Childhood, to which Toys and Gaiety were proportionable. 
Befides, 'tis, fure, allowable upon a foberer Account, that 
they who defign Marriage (hould give themfelves the Ad- 
vantage of decent Ornaments, and not by the negligent 

Rudenefs 



He whole Duty ^^ Woman. jy 

Rudends of their Drcis bcly Nature, and ren 'cr thcm- 
ielves lefs amiable than (he has made them : But all this 
being granted, 'twill by no Means juftify that exceflivc 
Curiofity and SoUicitude, that Expence of Time, and Mo- 
ney too, which is now ufed. A very moderate Degree of 
all thofc will fervc for that ordinary Decency which they 
need provide for, will keep them from the Reproach of an 
affected Singularity, which is as much as a fober Perfon 
need take Care for : And we muft take Leave to fay, that 
in order to Marriage, fuch a Moderation is much likelier 
to fucceed than the contrary Extravagance. Among the 
prudenter Sort of Men it certainly is, if it be not among 
the Loofe and Vain, againft which 'twill be their Guard, 
and fo do them the greater Service. For certainly, he that 
choofes a Wife for thofe Qualities for which a wife Man 
would refufe her, underftands fo little what Marriage is, 
as portends no great Felicity to her that (hall have him : 
But if they dcfire to marry Men of Sobriety and Dlfcrc- 
tion, they are obliged in Juftice to bring the fame Qua- 
lities they expeft, which will be very ill evidenced by that 
Excefs and Vanity we now fpeak of. 

For to fpeak a plain (tho' perhaps ungrateful) Truth, this 
(together with fome of the modifh Liberties novf in Uft) 
is it, which keeps fo many young Ladies about the Town 
unmarried 'till they lofe the Epithet of Young. Sober Men 
are afraid to venture upon a Humour fo difligreeing to their 
own, leaft whilft (according to the primitive Reafon of 
Marriage) they feek a Help they efpoufe a Ruin: But 
this is efpecially dreadful to a plain Country Gentleman, 
who looks upon one of thefe fine Women as a gaudy Idol, 
to whom, ii he once become a Votary, he muft facrlfice 



78 ^he whole Duty^^Woman. 

a great Part of his Fortune and all his Content. How 
reafonable that Apprehenfion is, the many Wrecks of con- 
fiderablc Families do too evidently atteft : But it is to be 
prefumed fome of the nicer Ladies have fuch a Contempt 
of any thing that they pleafe to call Ruftic, that they will 
not much regret the averting of thofe whom they fo de- 
fpife, they will not, perhaps, while they are in purfuit or 
hopes of others ; but when thofe fail thefe will be iook'd 
on as a welcome Referve; and, therefore, 'twill be no 
Prudence to cut themfelves off from that laft Refort, Icaft 
they, as many have done, betake themfelves to much 
worfe. For as in many Inftances 'tis the Country which 
feeds and maintains the Grandeur of the Town, fo of all 
Commerces there, Marriage would fooneft fail if all raral 
Supplies were cut off. 

But we have purfued this Speculation farther than, per- 
haps, our Virgin Readers will thank us for 5 we fliall re- 
turn to that which it was brought to inforce, and befeech 
them, that if not to Men, yet to approve themfelves to 
God, they will confine themfelves in the Matter of their 
Dreft within the due Limits of Decency and Sobriety. 
We (hall not direft them to thofe ftridt Rules which 7^r- 
tulltan and fome other of the ancient Fathers have prc- 
fcrib'd in this Matter, our Petition is, only, that our Vir- 
gins would at leafl fo take care of their Bodies, as Perfons 
that alfo have a Soul ; which if they can be perfuaded to, 
they may referve much of their Time for more worthy 
Ufes than thofe of the Comb, the Toilet and the Glafs: 
And traly, 'tis not a little their Concern to do fo, for this 
Sprmg of their Age is that critcal Infbnt that muft either 
coniirm or blaft the Hopes of all the fucceeding Seafons. 

" The

The Minds of young People are ufually compared to a 
blank Sheet of Paper, equally capable of the beft or the 
worft Impreflions ; 'tis pity they (hould be fili'd with child- 
i(h Scrawls and little infignificant Figures, but 'tis Shame 
and Horror they (hould be ftain'd with any vicious Cha- 
racters, any Blots of Impurity or Diflionour. To prevent 
which, let the fevereft Notions of Modefty and Honour 
be early and deeply imprefs'd upon their Souls, graven as 
with the Point of a Diamond, that they may be as inde- 
lible as they are indilpenfibly ncceflary to the Virgin State. 
There is alfo another very requifite Quality, and that is 
Obedience. The younger Sort of Virgins are fuppofed to 
have Parents, or if any has been fo unhappy as to lofe 
them early, they commonly are left in the Charge of Ibme 
Friend or Guardian that is to fupply the Place ; fo that 
they cannot be to feek to whom this Obedience is to be 
paid : And it is not more their Duty than their Intereft to 
pay it Youth is apt to be foolifh in its Deligns, and^ 
heady in the purfuit of them ; and there can be nothing 
more deplorable than to have it left to itfelf : And, there- 
fore, God, who permits not even the Brutes to deflitutc 
their young ones till they attain to the Perfection of their 
Kind, has put Children under the Guidance and Protecti- 
on of their Parents, till, bv the maturing of their Judgments, 
they are qualified to be their own Condudlors. Now this. 
Obedierice (as that which is due to all other Superiors) is to 
extend itfelf to all Things that are either good or indiffer- 
ent, and has no Claufe of Exception, but only where the 
Command is unlawful s and in fo wide a Scene of A£tion 
there will occur (o many particular Occasions of Submiffi-* 
00, that^thcy had need have, a great Reverence . of their

Pafents Judgments, and Diftruft of their own : And if it 
fliould happen that fome Parents are not qualified to give 
them the former, yet, the general Imbecility of their Age, 
will remain a conftant Ground of the latter ; fo that they 
may fafelier venture themfelves to their Parents Mif-guid- 
ance, than their own, by how much the Errors of Hu- 
mility and Obedience are lefs malignant than thofe of Pre- 
fumption and Arrogance. 

- But this is a Dodtrine which will fcarce pafs for Ortho- 
dox with many of the young Women of our Days, with 
whom 'tis Prejudice enough agairift the prudenteft Advice, 
that it comes from their Parents. It is the grand Ingenui- 
ty of thefe Times to turn every thing into Ridicule ; and 
if a Girl can but rally fmartly upon the fober Admonition 
of a Parent, (he concludes, flie is the abler Perfon, takes 
herfelf for a Wit, and the other for a Fop, (a bugbear 
Word, devifed to fright all Serioufnefs and Sobriety out of 
the World) and learns not only to difobey but to contemn. 
Indeed, the great Confidence that Youth now feems to 
have of itfelf, as it is very indecent, fo it is extremely per- 
nicious. Children that will attempt to go alone before 
their Time, oft get dangrtdds Falls: And when thofe 
who are but little removed from Children, (hall caft off 
the wifer Condud of others', 'they oft fadly mifcarry by 
their own. 

We know this Age has fo great a Contempt of the for- 
mer, that it is but Matter of Scorn to alledgc any of their 
Cuftoms, elfe we (hould fay, that the Liberties that are 
taken now, would then have been ftartled at. They that 
fliould then have feen a young Maid rambling abroad with- 
out her Mother^ or fome other prudent Perfon^ would

have look'd on her as a Stray» and thought it but a neigh- 
bourly Office to have brought her home ; whereas, now it 
'tis a Rarity to fee them in any Company graver than them- 
feves, and (he that goes with her Parent, unlefs it be fuch 
a Parent as is as wild as herfelf, thinks flie does but walk 
abroad with her Jailor : But, fure, there arc no finall MiC- 
chiefs that attend this Liberty, for it leaves them perfectly 
to the Choice of their Company, a thing of too weighty an 
Importance for giddy Heads to determine, who will be 
£ire to ele£t fuch as are of their own Humour, with whom 
they may keep up a Trafiick of little Impertinencies and 
trifline Entertainments ; and fo by Confequence condemn 
tfaemfelves never to grow wifer, which they may do by an 
ingenious Converiation. Nay, 'tis well if that negative 111 
be the worft, for it gives Opportunity to any that have ill 
Dcfigns upon them. It will be eafy getting into their 
Company who have no Guard to keep any body out, and 
as eafy, by little Compliances and Flatteries, to infinuate 
into their good Graces who have not the Sagacity to dii^ 
cern to what infidious Purpofes thofe Blandifhments are 
diredied ; and when they once begin to nibble at the Bait> 
to be pl^fed with the Courtship, 'tis great Odds they dp 
not efcape the Hook. 

Alas, how many poor innocent Creatures have been thus 
indiicemibly enihared ; have at firft, perhaps, only liked 
the Wit and Raillery, perhaps the Language and Addre&» 
then the Freedom and good Humour, till at laft they come 
to like the Peribn. It is, therefore, a moft necefiary Cau- 
tion for young Women not to truft too much to their own 
Conduct, but to own their Dependance on tho& to whom 
God and Nature has fubje£ted them^ and to look on it not 

L as 



Sz ^ie whole T) u ty .^wjWomam. 

as their Reflraint and Burden^ but as ihdr Shelter and 
Protedlion. For where once the Authority of a Parent 
conies to be defpis'd, tho' in the lighteft Inftance, it kys 
the Foundation of utmoft Difbbediencc. She that will 
-not be prefcrib'd to in the Choice of her ordinary diverting 
Company, will lefs be fo in choofing the fix'd Companion 
of her Life; and we find it often eventually true, that 
thofe who govern themfelves in the foraier, will not be 
-governed by their Friends in the latter, but by Pre-enigage- 
ments of their own prevent their Eledtions fortbcm. 

And this is one of the higheft Injuries they can do their 
Parents, who have fuch a native Right in tl^m, that 'tis 
no leis an Injuilice than Difobedience to di^ofe of them- 
'felves without them. This Right of the Pto^ent is fo uri- 
dcHibtcd, that we find God himfetf gives waly to it, and 
-will not faffer the moft holy Pretence, no, not that of a 
Vow, to invade it, as we may fee his own flating of the 
Cafe, Numb. xxx. How will he then refcnt it to have 
this {b indifpenfible a Law violated upon 'the inipdlfe of an 
impotent Pafficn, an amoroufs Inclinatiion ? Nor .is the Fol-

Love being fo unable to fupport them, that it cannot main^

Lovers into thofe Straits frotn whence it cannot rcfcue thenii 
So that, indeed, it does but play the Decoy with them, 
brings them into the Noofe and then retires j for when fe- 
cular Wants begin to pinch them, all the Tranfports of 
their Kindnefs do ufually convert into mutual Accuiations, 
for having made each other miferable. 

And, indeed, there is no Reafon to cxpcdk any better 
Event, bccaufe in the fecond Place, they forfeit their Title 
to the divine Blefling ; nay, they put themfelvcs out of the 
€}apacity to a«k it, it being a ridiculous Impudence to beg 
df God to profper the Tranfgrefiions of his Law. Such 
Weddings Kem to invoke ibme of tlie Poetic Romantic 
Deities, Fenus and Hymen, from whence ihey derive a 
Happineis as fictitious as are the Gods that are to fend it. 

Let all Virgins, therefore, religioufly obferve this Part 
of Obedience to their Parents, that they may not only have 
their BenediitioA, but God's: And to that Purpofe let this 
be laid as a fundamental Rule, that they never hearken to 
any Proposal of Marriage nwde them from any other 
Hand; but when any fuch Overture is made, divert the 
Addrefs from herfclf, and dired: it to her Parents, which 
will be the befl Teft imaginable for any Pretender. For 
if he know himfelf worthy of her, he will not fear to 
avow his Defigfi to them ; and, therefore, if he decline

But as a Daughter is neither to anticipate nor contradid:

ought well to examine the Grounds of her Averfion, and 
if they prove only childKh and fanciful, fliould endeavour 
to corredt them by Reafon and ibber Confideration ; if af-

is begun with fucli a Peijury, 'tis no wonder to find it con- 
tinued on at the fame Rate, that other Parts of the Vow

does heartily cleave to her Husband. It is to be feared, that 
this is a Confequence whereof there are too many fad In*

tues which will hold out againfl all the Temptations their

And if they may not upon the more generous Motive of 
Obedience, much lefs may they upon the worfe. Induce- 
ments of Avarice and Ambition ; for a Woman to make a 
Vow to the Man, and yet intend only to marry his For- 
tune, or his Tide, is the bafeft Infincerity, and fuch as in 
any other Kind of civil Cpn trades, would not only have 
the Infamy but the Pnnifliment of a Cheat. Nor will it 
at all fecure them, that in this 'tis only liable to God's 
Tribunal : For that is not like to make the Doom lefs, 
but more heavy, it being as the Apoftle witnefles, Afear- 
Jul thing to fall in the Hands of the living God. Heb. x. 3 1 . 
In a Word, Marriage is God's Ordinance and ihould be 
confider'd as fuch, not made a Stale tp any unworthy De- 
fjgn : And it may , well . be prefum'd, one Caufe why fo 
few Matches are happy, that they are not built upon a right 
Foundation : Some are grounded upon Wealth, fome on

but he is neither advis'd with as to the Motives, nor fcarce 
£ipplicated as to the Event of Wedding. Indeed, 'tis a de- 
plorable Sight to lee with what Lightnefs and Uncon- 
cerndnefs young People go to that weightieft A<Sion of 
their Lives; that a Marriage Day is but a kind of a Bac-

The 



Tie nvbok D u T Y of a Wo-m a n. ^y 

The, Civility of Women, which is always to be pre- 
fer vcd, muft not be carried to a Compliance ^ which may 
betray them into irrecoverable Miftakes. This French am- 
biguous Word Complaifance^ has led Women into mor^ 
Bkme, than all other Things put together. It carries 
them by Degrees into a certain Thing, called a goad kind 
of IVomany an eafy idle Creature that doth neither Good 
nor lU but by Chance, has no Choice, but leaves that to 
the Company {he keeps. TUme^ which by Degrees adds to 
the Signification of Words, has made her, according to 
the modern Stile, little better than one who thinks it a 
Radenefs to deny when civilly required, either her Ser- 
vice in Perfon, or her friendly Afliftance, to thofe who 
would have a Meeting, or want a Confident. She is a 
certain Thing always at. Hand, an eafy Companion, who 
has ever great Compaflion for diftrefled Lovers: She cen- 
fupes nothing, but Rigour y and is never without a Plaifter 
,for a wounded Reputation, in which chiefly lies her Skill 
'in Surgery : She feldom has the Propriety of any particular 
Gallant bu* lives upon Brokage, and waits for the Scraps 
her Friends are content to leave her. 

There is another Charafter not quite" fo criminal, yet not 
left ridiculous -, which is, that of a good humour'd Io- 
nian, one who thinketh (he muft always be in a Laiigh, 
or a broad Smile, becaufe Good-Humour is an obliging 
Quality; thinks it lefs ill Manners to talk impertinently 
than to be filent in Company .j , When fuch a prating En- 
gine rides Admiral, and carries the Lanthorn in a Circle of 
fools, a chearfal Coxcomb coming in for a Recruit, the 
cbattcrmg of Monkeys is a better Noife than fuch a Con-

is fo encouraged, ' that, like a Ballad Singer, who, if com- 
«mended, breaks his Lungs, flie lets herfelf loofc and over- 
flows upon the Company. She conceives that Mirth is to 
have no Intermiflion, and, therefore, (hfe will carry it about 
with her, tho' it be to a Funeral ; and if a Man {hould 
put a familiar Queftion, fhc does not know very well 
how to be angry, for then (he would be no more that 
pretty Thing, called a good-humour'd Woman. This Ne- 
ceflity of appearing at all Times to be fo infinitely pleafed, 
is a grievous Miftake, fince in a handfome Woman that 
Invitation is unneccffary ; and in one who is not fo ridi- 
culous. It is not intended by this, that Women fhould for- 
fwear Laughing; but let them remember, that Fools being 
always painted in that Pofture, fhould frighten thofe who 
are wife from doing it too frequently, and going too near a 
Copy which is fo little inviting; and much more from 
doing it loud, which is an unnatural Sound, and looks fo 
much like another Sex, that few Things are more oflfenfivc. 
That boifterous Kind of Jollity is as contrary to Wit and 
good Manners, as it is to Modefty and Virtue. Befides, it 
is a coarfe Kind of Quality^ that throws a Woman into a 
lower Form, and degrades her from the Rank of thofe 
who are more refined. Some Ladies ibeak loud and make 
a Noife to be the more minded, which looks as if they 
beat their Drums for Voluntiers; and if by Misfortune 
none come into them, they may, not without Reafon, be 
a good deal out of Countenance. 

There is one Thing yet more to be avoided, which is, 
the Example of thofe who intend nothing farther than the 
Vanity of Conqueil, and think themfelves fecure of not 
having their Honour tainted by it. Some are apt to bc^

Ucvc their Virtue is too obfcurc, and not enough known, 
except it is exposed to a broader Light, and fet out to its 
bcft Advantage by fome publick TriaU. Thcfe are dan- 
gerous Experiments, and generally fail, being built upon 
fc weak a Foundation, as that of a too great Confidence in 
ourfelves. It is as iafe to play with Fire, as to daily with 
Gallantry. Love is a Pamon that has Friends in the Gar-> 
riibn, and for that R^afbn muft, by a Wonian, be kept at 
iuch a Diftance, that ihc may not be within the Danger 
qf doing the moft ufual Thing in the World, which is 
coofpiring againft herielf : Elfe the humble Gallant, who 
is only admitted as a Trophy, very often becomes the Con* 
queror ; he puts on the Style of Vidory, and from an Ad- 
miirer grows into a Mailer, for fo he may be called from 
the Moment he is in PoiTeffion. The firft Refolutions of 
flopping at good Opinion and Efleem, grow weaker by 
Degrees againft the Charms of Courtihip skilfully apply 'd. 
A Lady is apt to think a Man fpeaks Co much Reafon whilil 
be is comn^ending her, that Ihe has much ^do to believe 
him in the Wrong when he is making Love to her : And 
when, beiidtt the natural Inducements the Sex has to be 
merciful, £be is bribed by well-chofen Flattery, the poor 
Creamre is in Danger of being caught like a Bird liflening 
to the Whiftle of one who has a Snare for it. Conqueft is 
fo tempting a Thing, that it often makes Women miftake 
Mens Subminions ; which with all their fair Appearances, 
have generally lefs Refpe£l than Art in them. Women 
ihould remember, that Men who iay extreme fine Things, 
many Times iay them moft for their own Bakes ; and that 
the vain Gallant is often as well pleaied with his own Com- 
pliments, as he could be with the kindeft Anfwer. Wher«

there is not that Oftentation, you are to fuipe£t there is a 
Defign : And as flrong Pcirfumes are feldom ufed but where 
they are neccflary to another an unwelcome Scent, fo ex- 
ceflive good Words leave room to believe they are ftrewed 
to cover fomething, which is to gain Admittance under a 
a Difguife. Women muft, therefore, be upon their Guard, 
and confider, that of the two, RefpeG is more dangerous 
than Anger. It puts even the beft Underftandings out of 
their Place for the Time, till fecond Thoughts reftore 
them ; it fteals upon us infenfibly, and throws down our 
Defences, and makes it too late to refift, after we have gi- 
ven it that Advantage. Whereas Railing goes away in Sound, 
it has fo much Noife in it, that by giving Warning it be- 
fpeaks Caution. Refpedt is a flow and fiire Poifon, and, 
like Poifon, fwells us within ourfelves. Where it prevails 
too much it grows to be a kind of Apoplexy in the Mind, 
turns quite round, and after it has once feized the Under- 
ftanding, becomes mortal to it. For thefe Reafons, the 
fafeft way is to treat it like a fly Enemy, and to be perpe- 
tually upon the Watch againft it. 

One Advice may be added to conclude this Head, which 
is, that Women (hould let every feven Years make fomc 
Alteration in them towards the graver fide, and not be like - 
the Girls of fifty, who refolved to be always young, what- 
ever Time with his Iron Teeth determined to the contrary. 
Unnatural Things carry a Deformity in them never to be 
difguifed j the Livelinefs of Youth in a riper Age, looks 
like a new Patch upon an old Gown ; fo that a gay Ma- 
tron, a chearful old Fool, may be reafonably put into the 
Lift of the tamer Kind of Monfters. There is a certain 
Creature called, a grave Hobby-Horfe, a kind of a She

needs go to Bartholomew) Fair, to look after the young 
Folks, whom (he only feems to make her Care ; in reality 
{he takes them for her Excufe. Such an old Butterfly is, 
of all Creatures, the mod ridiculous, and fooneft found out. 
It is good to be early in your Caution, to avoid any thing 
that comes within Diftance of luch defpicable Patterns, 
and not like ibme Ladies, who defer their Converiion till 
they have been fo long in Pofleffion of being laughed at, 
that the World doth not know how to change their Style, 
even when they are reclaimed from that which gave the 
firft Occafionfor it« 

The Advantages of being referred are too many to be 
&t down ; we will only lay, that it is a Guard to a good 
Woman, and a Difguife to an ill One. It is of fo much 
Uie to both, that thoie ought to ufe it as an Artifice who 
refiife to prad:ice it as a Virtue.

Fnendfhips. Perhaps the befl are not without their Ob-

lent Intimacies, whcii once broken, of which they fcarce 
ever fail, make fuch a Noife ; the Bag of Secrets untied, 
they fly about like Birds let loofe from a Cage, and become 
the Entertainment of the Town. Bcfidcs, thefe great 
Dearnefles, by Degrees, grow injurious to the reft of their 
Acquaintance, and throw them off. There is fiich an of- 
fenfive DiftinAion when the dear Friend comes into the 
Room, that it is flinging Stones at the Company, who and 
not apt to forgive it. 

It is wrong to lay out Friendfhip too laviftily at firA, 
fince it will, like other Things, be fo much the feoner 
fpent ; neither Ihould it be fuficted to be of too &ddon a 
Growth -, for as the Plants which (hoot up too feftare nek 
of that Continuance as thofe which take ttiore Time for

If a Friend happens to fall from the State of Innocence 
after Kindnefs is engaged to her, a Woman fliould be flow 
in her Belief in the Beginning of the Difcovery : But as 
foon as (he is convinced \fy a rational Evidence, (he ought, 
without breaking too roughly, to make a fair and quick 
Retreat from fuch a miilaken Acquaintance : Elie by move- 
iag too flowly from one that is io tainted, the Contagion 
may reach io far, as to give Part of the Scandal, tho' not 
of the Guilt. This Matter is fo nice, that as a Perfon 
muft not be too bafty to join in the Cenfure uppn a Friend 
when flae is accuibfl, io^ on the other Side, (he fhould not 
defend her with too much Warmth; for if (he fliould hap-

they arc alone, fliall make her theSubjedl of their Mirth, 
and, perhaps, with Refpedt to the Goddefs of Love be it 
fpoken, it is not the worft Part of their Entertainment, at 
lead it is the moft lading, to laugh at the believing Friend, 
who was fo eafily deluded. 

Good Senfe ought to be a chief Ingredient in the Choice 
of Friends, elfe let a Woman's Reputation be never fo 
clear, it may be clouded by the Impertinence of her Con- 
fident. It is like our Houfes being in the Power of a 
drunken or a carelefs Neighbour ; only fo much worfe, as 
thatthere will beno Infurance here to make Amends, as there 
is in the Cafe of Fire. 

To conclude on this Head. If Formality is to be allow- 
ed in any Inflance, it is to be put on to refift the Invafion 
of fuch forward Women as mall preis themfelves into the 
Friendftiip of others, where, if admitted, they will either 
be a Snare or an Incumbrance. 

We will come next to the Confidcration, how Women 
are to manage their Cenfure ; in which both Care and Skill 
will be a good deal requifite. To diftinguifh is not only 
natural but neceflary ; and the Effect of it is, that we can- 
not avoid giving Judgment in our Minds, either to abfolve 
or condemn, as the Cafe requires. The Difficulty is, to 
know when and where it is fit to proclaim the Sentence. 
An Averfion to what is criminal, a Contempt of what is 
ridiculous, are the infeparable Companions of UndeiAand- 
ing and Virtue ; but the letting them go farther than our 
own Thoughts, hath fo much Danger in it, that though it 
is neither pofiible nor fit to fupprefs them intirely, yet it is 
neceflary they fliould be kept under very great Reftraints. 
An unlimited Liberty of this Kind is little lefs than fend-

ing a Herald and proclaiming War to the World, which 
is an angry Beaft, when fo provoked. The Conteft will 
be unequal, tho' we are never fo much in the Right : And 
if a Woman begins againft fuch an Adverfary, it will tear 
her in Pieces with this Juftification, that it is done in its 
own Defence. They muft, therefore, take Heed of laugh- 
ing except in Company that is very fure. It is throwing 
Snow-Balls againft Bullets; and it is the Diiadvantage of a 
Woman, that the Malice of the World will help the Bru- 
tality of thofe who will throw a flovenly Untrath upon 
her. They are for this Reafon to fupprels their Im- 
patience for Fools ; who, befides they are too ftrong a 
Party to be unneccffarily provoked, are of all others, 
the moft dangerous in this Cafe. A Blockhead in his 
Rage will return a dull Jeft that will lie heavy, though 
there is not a Grain of Wit in it. Others will do it with 
more Art, and a Perfon muft not think herfelf fecure be- 
caufe her Reputation may, perhaps, be out of the Reach 
of Ill-will 'y for if it finds that Part guarded, it will feek 
one which is more expoied. It flies, like a corrupt Hu- 
mour in the Body, to the weakeft Part. If a Woman 
has a tender Side, the World will be fure to find it, and 
to put the worft Colour upon all (he fays or does, it will 
give an Aggravation to every thing that may lefTen her, 
and a fpiteful Turn to every thing that might recommend 
her. Anger lays open tnofe Defers which Friendrtiip 
would not fee, and Civility might be willing to forget j Ma- 
lice needs no fuch Invitation to encourage it, neither are 
any Pains more fuperfluous than thofe we take to be ill 
ipoken of. If Envy, which never dies, and feldom fleeps,

is content fometimes to be in a Slumber, it is very unskil- 
ful to make a Noife to awake it. 

Bcfides, a Lady's Wit will be mifapply'd if it is wholly 
diredied to difcern the Faults of others, when it is fo ne- 
ceflary to be often ufed to mend and prevent her own. The 
fending our Thoughts too much abroad has the fame Ef- 
fc<5l as when a Family never ftays at home ; Ncgledl and 
Difordcr naturally follows ; as it muft do within ourfelves, 
if we do not frequently turn our Eyes inwards, to fee 
what is amifs with us, where it is a Sign wc have an un- 
welcome Profpeifl, when we do not care to look upon it, 
but rather fcek our Confolations in the Faults of thofe we 
Converfe with. 

Avoid being the firft in fixing a hard Cenftire j let it be 
confirmed by the general Voice before you give into it ; 
neither fhould any one then give Sentence like a Magiftrate, 
or as if (he had a fpecial Authority to bcftow a good or ill 
Name at Difcretion. She fliould not dwell too long upon 
a weak Side, a Touch and away, but take a Pleafure toi 
ftay longer where {he can commend ; like Bees that fix: 
only iipon thofe Herbs out of which they may extract the 
Juice of which their Honey is compofed. A Virtue fluck 
with Briflles is too rough for this Age; it muft be adorned 
with fome Flowers, or elfe it will be unwillingly entertain- 
ed 5 fo that even where it may be fit to ftrike, it ftiould be 
done like a Lady, gently ; and then (he may afiure herfelf^ 
that where (he cares to do it, (he will wound others more^ 
and hurt herfelf lefs, by foft Strokes, than by being har(h 
or violent. 

The Triumph of Wit is to make Good-Nature fubdue

Love, the other the Fruit. Vanity is never at its full 
Growth 'till it fpreads into AfFedation and then it is com* 
plete. 

Not to dwell any longer upon the Definition of them, 
we will pais to the Means and Motives to avoid them. In 
order to which, it muft be confidered, that the World 
challenges the Right of diftributing Efteem and Applaufe; 
fo that where any afTume by their (ingle Authority to be 
their own Carvers, it grows angry, and never fails to feck 
Revenge: And if we may meafure a Fault by the Great- 
nefs of the Penalty, there are few of a higher Size than 
Vanity, as there is fcarce a Punifhment which can be 
heavier than that of being laughed at. 

Vanity makes a Woman, tainted with it, fo top-fiiil of 
herfelf, that (he fpilleth it upon the Company : And bc- 
caufe her own Thoughts are intirely employed in Self-Con- 
templation, (he endeavours, by a cruel Miftake, to confine 
her Acquaintance to the fame narrow Circle of that which 
only concerns her Ladyfhip, forgetting that (he is not of 
half that Importance to the World that (he is to herfelf^ 
fo miftaken (he is in her Value by being her own Ap- 
praifer : She will fetch fuch a Compafs in Difcourib to bring 
in her beloved Self, and, rather than fail, her fine Petti- 
coat, that there can hardly be a better Scene than fuch a 
Trial of ridiculous Ingenuity.. It is a Pleafure to fee her 
angle for Commendations, and rife fo difiatisfied with the 
H^bred Company if they will not bite. To obferve her 
throwing her Eyes about to fetch ia Prifoners, and go a- 
bout craizing like a Privateer, and £3 out of Countenance 
if flic return without Booty, is no ill Piece of Comedy^ 
She is ib eager to draw Rcfpeft that flie always miiles ir»

yet thinks it ib much her Due, that when flic fails, (he grows 
wafpifli, not confidering, that it is impofTible to commit a 
Rape upon the Will ; that it muft be fairly gained, and 
will not be taken by Storm ; and that in this Cafe the Tax 
ever raifes higheft by a Benevolence. If the World, inftead 
of admiring her imaginary Excellencies, takes the Liberty 
to laugh at them, (he appeals from it to herfelf, for whom 
ihe gives Sentence, and proclaims it in all Companies. On 
the other Side, if encouraged by a civil Word, fhe is fo 
obliging, that (he will give Thanks for being laughed at 
in good Language. She takes a Compliment for a De^ 
monftration, and fets it up as an Evidence, even againfl 
her Looking-Gla& : But the good Lady being all this 
while io a moft profound Ignorance. of herielf, forgets that 
Men would not let her talk upon them, and throw fo many 
ienfeieis Words at their Heads, if they did not intend to 
put her Perfbn to Fine and Ranibme, for her Impertinence* 
Good Words of any other Woman, are fo many Stones 
thrown at her, (he can by no Means bear them, they make 
her ib. uneafy, that (he cannot keep her Seat, but up flie 
riies and goes Home half burft with Anger and ftrait-lacing : 
If by great Chance (he (ays any thing that has Senfe in it 
fhe expeds fuch an exceilive Rate of Commendations, that 
to her thinking, the Coippany ev^ ri(e8 in her Debt. She 
looks iipon Rules as Things made for (he common People, . 
and not for Peripns of her Rank ; and this Opinion fome-^^ 
times tempts her to extend her Prerogative to the diipenie- ' 
ing with the Commandments. If by great Fortune (he ' 
happens, in Spite of her Vanity, to be honeft, (he is fo . 
troublefome with it, that as far as in her lies, (he makes a 
fcurvy thing of it Her bragging of her Virtue, looks as ^ 

N 2 if - 



if it coft her fo much Pains to get the better of herfelf, 
that the Inferences are very ridiculous. Her good Humour 
is generally applied to the laughing at good Senfe. It 
would do one good to fee how heartily (he defpifes any thing 
that is fit for her to do. The greateft Part of her Fancy is 
laid out in choofing her Gown, as her Difcretion is chiefly 
employed in not paying for it. She is faithful to the Fa- 
fhion^ to which not only her Opinion, but her Senfes am 
wholly refigned : So obfequious (he is to it, that (he would 
be ready to be reconciled even to Virtue with all its Faults, ' 
if (he had her dancing Mailer's Word that it was pradiced 
at Court. 

To a Woman fo compofed, when AfFedation comts in 
to improve her Charafter, it is then raifed to the higheft 
Perfedion. She firft fets up for a fine Thirtg, and for 
that Reafon will diftinguifh herfelf right or tvrong, in every 
thing (he does. She would have it thoc^ht that (he is fnad^

and recover the Miftake into which the Lady's good Looks

C If A P. X* 
Of Pride an^ Diversions. 

AFTER having faid this againft Vanity, we do not 
intend to apply the fame Cenfure to Pride, well 
placed and rightly defined. It is an ambiguous Word i one 
kind of it is as much a Virtue, as the other is a Vice : But 
wc are naturally (o apt to choofe the worft, that it is be- 
come dangerous to commend the beft Side of it. 
, A Woman is not to be proud of her fine Gown j nor 
when (he- has lefs Wit than her Neighbours, to comfort 
herfelf that fhe has more Lace. Some Ladies put fo muck 
Weight upon Ornaments^ that if one could fee into their 
Hearts, it would be found, that even the Thoughts of 
Death made lefs heavy to them by the Contemplation of 
their being laid out in State, and honourably attended to 
the Grave. One may come a good deal fhort of fuch an 
Extream, and yet ftill be fufficientlv impertinent, by fet- 
ttog a wrong Value upon things wnich ought to be ufed 
with more Indifference. A Ladv mufl not appear follici^ 
tous to ingrofs Refpe£t to herfelf, but be content with a 
reafbnable Diflribution, and allow it to others, that (he 
may have it returned to her. She is not to be troublefome- 
ly nice, nor diflinguifh herfelf by being too delicate, as if 
ordinary Things were too coarfc for her ^ this is an un- 
mannerly and an oftcnfive Pride, and where it is pradticed* 
de&rves to be mortified, of which it fcldom fails. She is^ 
njot to lean too much, upon her Quality, much Icfs, to de- 

fpifcL

fpife thofe who are below it. Some make ^allty an Idol^ 
and then their Reafoiimuft fall dowa and worfhip it. They 
would have the World think, tliat no Amends can ever 
be made for the want of a great Title^ or an ancient Coat 
of Arms \ they imagine, that with thefe Advantages they 
ftand upon the higher Ground, which makes them look 
down upon Merit and Virtue, as Things inferior to them. 
This Miftake is not only fenfelefs^ but criminal too, in 
putting a greater Price upon that which is a Piece of good 
Ljuck^ than upon things that are valuable in themlelvcs; 
LaugJjtng is not enough for fuch a Folly; it muft be 
feverely whipped, as it juftly defervcs. It will be con- 
fefled, there are frequent Temptations given by pert Up- 
ftarts to be angry, and by that to have our Judgments^ cor- 
rupted in thefe Cafes^: But they are to be refifted ; and tlic 
utmoft that is to be' allowed^ is when thofe of a new Edi- 
tion will forget themfelves, fo as either to brag of their 
weak Side, or to endeavour to hide their Meannefe by thcif 
Infblence, to cure them by a little feafbnablc Builtery, a 
Rttle Sharpnefe well placed, without dwelling too long up- 
on it. 

Thefe and many other Kinds of Pride are to be avoided. 
That which is to be ifecommended, is an Emulation in 
a Woman to rife to a Charaftcr, by which fhe may be di- 
ftinguifhed ; an Eagernefs for Precedence in Virtue, and 
all iiich other Things as may gain a greater Share in the 
good Opinion of the World. Ejieem to Virtue is like a 
cherijhing Air to Plants and Flowers^ which makes them 
blow and profperj and for that Reafbn it may be allowed 
to be in fome Degree the Caufe as well as the Reward of in 
That Pride which leads to a good Endy cannot be a Vice, 

iince 



7i>ewbok\i\JTY of a Womak. 105 

fince it is the Begioning of a Virtue ; and to be pleafed 
with jaft Appjauie, is fo far from a Fault, that it would 
be an ill Symptom in a Woman, who (hould not place the 
greateft Part of her Satisfa£tion on it. Humility is, no 
Doubt, a great Virtue, but it ceafes to be fo, when it is 
afraid to fcorn an ill Thing. Againft Vice and Folly it is 
becoming the Female Sex to be haughty, but they mu(l 
not carry the Contempt of things to Arrogance towards 
Perfons, and it muil be done with fitting Diftincflions, elie 
it may be inconvenient by being unfeafonable : A Pride 
that raiieth a little Anger, to be outdone in any thing that 
is good, will have fo good an EfFed, that it is very hard 
to allow it to be a Fault. 

It is no eafy Matter to carry even between thefe differing 
Kinds defcrib'd ; but remember, that it is fafer for a V^o- 
man to be thought too proud, than too familiar. 

The laft T hing we have to recommend to young Wor 
men particularly^ tho* it likewife affeds thofe of every 
Arc and Station of Life, is, a wife and £ife Method of 
uung Diverfions. To be too eager in the Purfuit of Plea- 
iiire whilft they are young, is dangerous ; to catch at it in 
riper Years, is graining a Shadow ; it will not be held : 
J3e£des, that by being lefs natural it grows to be indecent. 
Diverfions are moft properly applied to eafe and relieve 
thofe who are om>refled, by being too much employed. 
Tho& that are idle have no need of them, and yet they, 
above all others, give themfelves up to them. To unbend 
our Thoughts, when thev are too much ftretched by our 
Cares, is not more natural than it is necefiary, but to turn 
our whole Lives into a Holiday, is not only ridiculous, 
but deftroys Pleafure inftead of promoting it. The Mind, 

O like

like the Body, is tired by being always in one t^oiture, tob 
ferious breaks, and too diverting bofend it : It is Variety 
that gives the Relifti ; fo that Diverfions too fr^iWentyy re-^ 
peated, grow firft to be indifferent, and at k« tedious t 
Whilft they are weU-chofen and well-timed, they are nevet 
to be blamed ; but when they are ufed to an Eiccds, tho* 
very innocent at firft, they often grow to be criminal, and 
never fail to be impertinent. 

Some Ladles are befpoken for merry Meetings, as Beffkfy 
in the Play, was for Duels. They are engag^ in a CitcXt 
of Idlenefs^ where they turn round for the whole Year, 
without the Interruption of a ferious Hour. They knoW 
all the Players Names, and are intimately acquainted with 
every Booth in Bartholomew- Fdif. No Soidiet is irtore 
obedient to the Sound of his Captain's Ttuhipet, than they

To play ibmctimcs to entertain Company, or for Wo^ 
men to divert themfelves, is not to be diiailow'd ; but t^ 
jdo it ib often as to be called^ G^mefters, is to be avoukdj 
next to Things that are moft priminal. It has Confe- 
quences of &veral Kinds not to be endured s it will engage 
them into a Habit of Idleneis and ill Hours, draw them 
into mixed Company, make them neglect their Civiities 
abroad, and their Bufinefs at hooae, and impose into their 
Acquaintance fbch as will do them no Credit.^ 

To deep Play there will be yet greater Objedtions : It 
wiW give Occafion to the World to ask fpiteful Queftions : 
How they dare venture to lofe, and what Means they have 
to pay fiich great Sums ? If they pay exa<ftly, it will be en- 
quired from whence the Money comes ? If they owe, and 
eipecially to a Man, they muft be fo very civil to him for 
his Forbearance, that it lays a Ground for having it far- 
ther improved, if the Gentleman is fo difpofed, who will 
be thoDgfat no un£ur Creditor, if, where the Eftate fails, 
he ietzes upon die Peribii. Befides, if a Lady could fee 
her own Face upon an ill Game, at a deep Stake, £be 
woidd certainly foiiwear any thing that could put her 
Lodes under foch a Di£uivantage : And as a certain io-

which is no very great Commendation. It is better for a 
Woman never to dance, becaufb (he has no Skill in it, 
than to do it too often, becaufe flie docs it weH. The 
eafieft, as well as the fafeft. Method of doing it, is in pri- 
vate Company, among particular Friends, and then car^ 
lefly like a Diverfion, rather than with Solemnity, as if tt

and her Servants, and fo (hall confidcr her in the'thrcc 
Capacities of a Wife, a Mother, and a M iftrefs. 

In that of a Wife her Duty has feveral Refpedls, as it re- 
lates, Firfiy To his Perfon -, Secondly^ To his Reputation ; 
thirdly y To his Fortune. The firft Debt to his Perfon 
is Love, which we find let as the prime Article in the 
Marriage Vow. And, indeed, that is the moft eflential 
Requiiite j without this it is only a Bargain and Corn- 
pad:, a Tyranny, perhaps, on the Man's Part, and a 
Slavery on the Woman's. It is Love only that cements 
the Hearts, and where that Union is wanting, it is but 
a Shadow, aCarcafsof Magiage. Therefore, as it is very 
ncceflary to bring fome Degree of this to this State, io 
it is no lefs to maintain and improve it in it. This is 
it which facilitates all other Duties of Marriage; makes 
the Yoke fit fo lightly, that it rather pleafes than galls. 
It (hould, therefore, be the Study of Wives to preferve 
this Flame, that, like the Veftal Fire, it may never go 
out : And to that End carefuUy to guard it from all thofe 
things which are naturally apt to extinguifti it s of which 
Kind are all Frowardnefe and little Perverfenefs of Hu- 
mour \ all ^Uen and morofe Behaviour, which by taking 
off from the Delight and Complacency o£ Converfation, 
will, by degrees, wear off the Kindnefe. 

But of all we know nothing more dangerous than that 
unhappy Paffion of Jealoufy, which tho* it is iaid to be the 
Child of Love, yet, like the Viper, its Birth is the cer^ 
. tain Deftrudtion of the Parent.. As, therefore, they muft 
be. nicely care&il to give their Hufbands no Colour, no 
leaft Umbrage for it j fo ihould they be as refolute to re- 
fill all that occurs to themfelves, be io far firom that bufy 

Curiofity, 



lib ^he whole Dttty ^// Woman. 

Curiofity, that Induftry to find Caufes of Sufpicion, that 
even where they prefented themfelves they fliould avert 
the Confideration j put the moft candid Conftruftion up- 
on any doubtful A(5tion. And, indeed, Charity in this 
Inftance has not more of the Dove than of the Serpent. 
It is infinitely the wifeft Courfe, both in relation to her 
prefent Quiet, and her fixture Innocence. The entertain- 
ing a jealous Fancy, is the admitting the moft treacher- 
ous, the moft difturbing Inmate in the World ; and (he 
opens her Breaft to a Fury that lets it in. 'Tis certainly 
one of the moft enchanting Frenzies imaginable, keeps 
her always in a moft reftlef%importunate Search after that 
which ftie dreads and abhors to find, and makes her equal- 
ly miferable when {he is injured and when flie is not. 

And as £he totally lofcs her Eafe, fo 'tis odds but fhe will 
part alfo with fome Degrees of her Innocence. Jealoufy is 
commonly attended with a black Train ; it muftcrs all the 
Forces of x)ur trafciblc Part to abet its Quarrel, Wrath and 
Anger, Malice and Revenge ; and by how much the Fe- 
male Impotence to govern thofe Paflions is the greater, fo 
much the more dangerous is it to admit that which wiU {o 
furely fet them in an Uproar. For if yealoujly be, as the 
wife Mati, fays, the Rage of a Matty Prov. vi. 34. wc 
may well think it may be the Fury, the MadndS pf a 
Woman. And, indeed, all Ages have given tragical In- 
ftances of it, not only in the moft indecent Fiercenefs and 
Clamour, but in the folemn Mifchiefs of adhial Revenges. 
Nay, it is to be doubted there have been ibme whofe MaUoe 
has rebounded; who have mined themfelves in Spight, 
have been adulterous by way of Retaliation, and taken more 
feandalous Liberties dmn thofe they complained of in their

Hufbands : And when foch enormous Effects as the/e are 
the Iflbcs of Jealoufy, it ought to keep a Woman on the

But, perhaps, it may be iaid, that fome are not left to 
their Jealoufy and Conjoftures, but have more demonftra-

for Men to publifh their Sin, and the Offender does fome-

it muft be confefTcd, be fcarce pofTible to difbelieve him ;

Bitternefs, he thinks he needs no other Apology for his own 
Lufl'. 

A wife Diflimulation, or very calm Notice, is fiirc the 
likelieft Means of reclaiming j for where Men have not 
wholly put off Humanity, there is a native Compaflion to 
a meek Sufferer. We have naturally fome Regret to fee a 
Lamb under the Knife, whereas, the impatient Roaring 
of a Swine diverts our Pity ; fo that Patience in this Cafe 
is as much the Intereft, as Duty, of a Wife. 

But there is another Inftance wherein that Virtue has a 
fcverer Trial, and that is, when a Wife lies under the 
caufelefs Jealoufies of the Husband. This is, fure, one 
of the greateft Calamities that can bcfal a virtuous Wo- 
man, who as {he accounts nothine fb dear as her Loyalty 
and Honour, fo (he thinks no Intelicity can equal the af- 
perling of thofe, efpecially when it is from him, to whom 
(lie ihas been the moft foUicitous to approve herfelf. 

That we may the better prefcribe a Cure for this Evil, wc 
{hall enter into an Enquiry into the Springs and Cauies 
of it. 

Jealousy is that Pain which a Man feels from the 
Apprehenfion^ that he is not equally helmed by the Perfon 
whom he entirely loves. Now, becaufe our inward Pa{!ioQs 
and Inclinations can never make them{elves vifible, it is 
impo{iible for a jealous Man to be thoroughly cured of his 
Su^icions. His Thoughts hang at be{l in a State of 
Doubtfulnefs and Uncertainty > and are never capable of 
receiving any Satisfaction on the advantageous Side ; io 
that his Inquiries are moft fucce{sful when they difix)ver 
nothing: His Pleafure arifes from his Diiappointments, 

and

dnd his Life is fjpent in Puriiiit of a Secret that deftroys his 
Happinefs if he chance to find it. 

An ardent Love is always a ftrong Ingredient in this Paf- 
iion ; for the fame AfFcdtion which ftirs up the jealous 
Man's Defires, and gives the Party beloved 10 beautiful a 
Figure in his Imagination, makes him believe (he kindles 
the fame Paffion in others, and appears as amiable to all 
Beholders : And as Jealoufy thus ariies from an extraordi- 
nary Love, it is of fo delicate a Nature, that it fcorns to 
take up with any thing lefs than an equal Return of Love. 
Not the warmeft Expreflions of AfFeAion, the fofteft and 
mofl tender Hypocrify, are able to give any SatisfacStion, 
where we are. not perfiiaded that the AfFeftion is real and 
the Satisfaction mutual. For the jealous Man wifhes him- 
fclf a kind of Deity to the Perfon he loves : He would be 
the only Pleafure of her Senfcs, the Employment of her 
Thoughts ; and is angry at eveiy Thing (he admires or 
takes Delight in, befides himfelf 

The jealous Man's Difeafe is of fo malignant a Nature, 
that it converts all he takes into its own Nourifhment. A 
cool Behaviour fets him on the Rack, and is interpreted as 
an Inilance of Averfion or Indifference ; a fond one raifes 
his Sufpicions, and looks too much like Diilimulation and 
Artifice. If the Perfon he loves be cheerful, her Thoughts 
muil be employed on another ; and if fed, (he is certainly 
thinking on himfelf. In fhort, there is no Word or Gefture 
fo iiifignificant, but it eives him new Hints, feed his Sui^ 
picions, and fiirnifhes him with frefh Matters of Difcove- 
ry : So that if v^re confider the EfFeds of this Paffion, one 
would rather think it proceeded from an inveterate Hatred 
than an exceffive Love } for certainly none can meet with 

P more

more Difquietude and Uneafinefs than a iuipe<3:ed Wife, if 
we except the jealous Husband. 

But the great Unhappinefs of this Paflion is, that it na- 
turally tends to alienate the AfFedtion which it is fo follici- 
tous to engrofe ; and that for thefe two Reafons, becaufe it 
lays too great a Conftraint on the Words and Anions of 
the fufpefted Perfon, and at the fame Time (hews you have 
no honourable Opinion of her; both of which are ftrong 
Motives to Averfion. 

Nor is this the worft Effed: of Jealoufy, for it often 
draws after it a more fatal Train of Confequcnces, and 
makes the Perfon you fufpecS: guilty of the very Crimes 
you are fo much afraid of It is very natural for fuch who 
are treated ill and upbraided falfely, to find out an intimate 
Friend that will hear their Complaints, condole their Suffer- 
ings, and endeavour to footh and affwagc their fecret Re- 
lentments: Befides, Jealoufy puts a Woman often in Mind 
of an ill Thing, that fhe would not otherwife, perhaps, 
have thought • of, and fills her Imagination with fiich an 
unlucky Idea, as in 1 ime grows familiar, excites Define, 
and lofes all the Shame and Horror which might at firft at- 
tend it. Nor is it a Wonder, if fhe, who fufiers wrong- 
fully in a Man's Opinion of her, and has, therefore, no- 
thing to forfeit in his Efteem, refolves to give him Reafon 
for his Sufpicions, and to enjoy the Plcafure of the Crime 
fincefhemufl undergo the Ignominy. Such probably were 
the Confiderations that direded the wife Man in his Ad- 
vice to Husbands ; Be not jealous over the Wife of thy Bo^ 
Jomy and teach her not an evil Leffon againft thyjelf. Eccla£ 

And here, among other Torments, which this PafEon 
produces, we may ufaally obfervc^ that none arc greater 

Mourners 



^ewhoIeDvTY of <j Woman. 115 

Mourners than jealous Men, when the Perfon who provoked 
their Jealoufy istaken from them. Then it is that their Love 
breaks out fiirioufly and throws off all the Mixtures of 
Sufpicion which choaked and fmothered it before. The 
beautiful Parts of the Character rife uppermoft in the jea- 
lous Husband's Memory, and upbraid him with the ill 
Uiage of fo divine a Creature as was once in his Pofleflion ; 
whilft all the little Imperfcdions that were before fo un- 
cafy to him, wear off from his Remembrance, and flicw 
themfelves no more. 

We may fee by what has been iaid, that Jealoufy takes 
deepeft Root in Men of amorous Difpoiitions ; and of thefp 
we find three Kinds who are moft over-run with it. 

The Firft, are thofc who are confcious to themfclves of 
any Infirmity, whether it be WeakneJfe, old Age, Defor- 
mity, Ignorance, or the like. Thcfe Men are To well ac- 
quainted with the unamiable Part of themfelves, that they 
have not the Confidence to think they are really beloved, 
and are fo diftraflful of their own Merits, that all Fondnefs 
towards them puts them out of Countenance, and looks 
like a left upon their Perfbns. They grow fuipicious on 
their nrft looking in a Glafs, and are ftung with Jealoufy 
at the Sight of a Wrinkle. A handfome Fellow imme- 
diately alarms them, and every thing that looks young or 
gay turns their Thoughts upon their Wives. 

A fecond fort of Men, who are mofl liable to this Pafli- 
on. are thofe of cunnine, wary, and difhuflful Temno^ 



«tjiii»it 



Politicians, that they leave nothing to Chance or Humour, 
but are ftill for deriving every A^on from firnie Plot or 
Contrivance, for drawing up a perpetual Scheme of Cauiet

and Events, and prcfcrving a conflant Correfpondcncc be- 
tween the Camp and the Council-Table. And thus it hap- 
pens in the Afiairs of I.ove with Men of too refined a 
Thought. They put a Conftrudlion on a Look, and find 
out a Defign in a Smile j they give new Senfes and Signifi- 
cations to Words and Adlions, and arc ever tormenting 
themfelves with Fancies of their own raifing: They ge- 
nerally a6t in a Difguife themfelves, and, therefore, miC- 
take all outward Shews and Appearances for Hypocrify in 
others ; fo that we believe no Men fee lefs of the Trath 
and Reality of Things, than thefe great Refiners upon In- 
cidents, who are fo wonderfully fubtle and over-wife in 
their Conceptions. 

Now what thefc Men fancy they know of Women by 
Refledion, lewd and vicious Men believe they have learn- 
ed by Experience. T hey have feen the poor Husband fo 
mifled by Tricks and Artifices, and in the midft of his In- 
quiries fo loft and bewildered in a crooked Intrigue, that 
they flill fufpedt an under-plot in every Female Action, 
and efpecially where they fee any Refemblance in the Be- 
haviour of two Perfons, are apt to fancy it proceeds from 
the fame Dcfign in both. Thefe Men, therefore, bare 
hard upon the fufpedled Party, purfue her clofe through all 
lier Turnings and Windings, and are too well acquainted . 
with the Chace, to be flung off by any falfe Steps or 
Doubles: Befides, their Acquaintance and Conver^tion 
has lain wholly among the vicious Part of Womenkind, 
and, therefore, it is no Wonder they cenfure all alike, and 
look upon the whole Sex as a Species of Impoftors : But if, 
notwithftanduig their private Experience, they can get 
over thefe Prejudices, and entertain a favourable Opinion 

of

of fbmc Women, yet, their own loofe Dcfircs will ftir up 
new Sufpicions from another Side, and make them believe 
all Men fubje<ft to the fame Inclinations with themielves. 

Whether thefe or other Motives are moft predominant, 
we learn from the modern Hiftories of America^ as well as 
from our own Experience in this Part of the World, that 
Jealoufy is no Northern Paflion, but rages moft in thofe 
Nations that lie neareft the Influence of the Sun. It is a 
Misfortune for a Woman to be born between the Tro- 
picks, for there lie the hotteft Regions of Jealoufy, which 
as you come Northward cools all along with the Climate, 
'till you fcarce meet any thing like it in the Polar Circle* 
Our own Nation is very temperately (ituated in this Re- 
fpcft ; and if we meet with fome few difordercd, with the 
Violence of this Paflion, they are not the proper Growth 
of our Country, but are many Degrees nearer the Sun in 
their Conftitution than in their Climate. 

After this frightful Account of Jealoufy, and the Per- 
fons who are moft fubjcd: to it, it will be but fair to fliew 
by what Means the Paflion may be beft allay *d and thofe 
who are poflefled with it fet at Eafe. Other Faults, indeed, 
arenotunder a Wife's Jurifdidion, and fliould, if pofljble, 
efeape her Oblervation ; but Jealoufy calls upon her parti- 
cularly, for its Cure, and deferves all her Art and Applica- 
tion in the Attempt : Befides, flie has this for her En- 
couragement, that her Endeavours will be always, pleaf- 
ing, and that flie will ftill find the Aflfedtion of her Hus- 
band rifing towards her in Proportion as his Doubts and 
Sufpicions vanifli; for, as we have feen all along, there is 
fo great a Mixture of Love in Jealoufy as is well worth the 
feparating. 

The 



ii8 TlewboleDvTY of aWoMAS. 

The firft' Rule we (hall propofe to be obferved is, that you 
never feem to diflikc in another what the jealous Man is 
himfelf guilty of, or to admire any thing in which he him- 
feif docs not excel. A jealous Man is very quick in his 
Applications, he knows how to find a double Edge in an 
Invcdtive, and to draw a Satyr on himfelf out of a Panegy- 
ric on another. He does not trouble himfelf to confider 
the Perfon, but to direft the Charaftcr; and is fecretly 
pleafed or confounded as he finds more or left of himfelf in 
it. The Commendation of any Thing in another, ftirs up 
Jealoufy, as it (hews you have a Value for others, bcfides 
himfelf; but the Commendation of that which he himfelf 
wants, inflames him more, as it (hews, that in fome Re- 
fpefts, you prefer others before him. Jealoufy is admirably 
defcribed, in this View, by Horace, in his Ode to Lydia. 

When Telephus his youthful Charms, 
His rofy ISeck and winding Arms, 
With endlefs Rapture you recite. 
And in that pleafng Name delight 5 
My Heart inflamed by jealous Heats, 
frith numberlefs Refentments beats ; 
From my pale Cheek the Colour flies. 
And all the Man within me dies: 
By Turns my hidden Grief appears 
In rifng Stghs and fallen Tears, 
That Jhew, too well, the warm Defires, 
The Blent, flow, confuming Fires, 
Which on my inmojt Vitals prey. 
And melt my very Soul away.

The jealous Man is not^ indeed, angry if you diflike an- 
ether, but if you find thofe Faults which are to be found 
in his own Charader, you difcovcr not only your Diflike 
of another, but of himfblf. In {hort, he is fo defirous of 
cngrofling all your Love, that he is grieved at the want of 
any Charai, which he believes has Power to raife it ; and if 
he finds, by your Cenfures on others, that he is not fo 
agreeable in your Opinion as he might be, he naturally 
concludes you could love him better if he had other Qua- 
lifications, and that by Confequence your AfFc<aion does 
not rife fo high as he thinks it ought. If, therefore, his 
Temper be grave or fuUen, you muft not be too much 
pleafed with a Jefl, or tranfported with any thing that is 

i gay and diverting. If his Beauty be none of the bed, 

i . you muft be a profefled Admirer of Pmdence, or any other 
Quality he is Mafter of, or at leaft vain enough to think 

! he is. 

I In the next Place, you muft be fure to be free and open 

in your Converiation with him, and to let in Light upon 
your A(ftions, to unravel all your Deiigns, and difcover 

I every Secret however trifling or indifferent. A jealous Hus- 
band has a particular Averiion to Winks and Whiipers, and 
if he does not fee to the Bottom of every thing, will be 

* fure to go beyond it in his Fears and Sufpicions. He will 
always expe^ to be your chief Confident, and where he 
finds himielf kept out of a Secret, will believe there is 
more in it than there ftiould be: And here it is of great. 
Concern, that you prcfervc the Character of your Sincerity 
uniform an4 of a^^piece ; for if he once finds a falfe Glofs 
ut upon any fingle Action, he quickly iufpeds all the reft ^

and runs off with it into feveral remote Confequehccs, till 
he has proved very ingenious in working out his own Mi- 
fery. 

if both thefe Methods fail, the beft way will be to let 
him fee you are much caft down and afflifted for the ill 
Opinion he entertains of you, and the Difquietudes he him- 
felf fuffers for your Sake. There are many who take a kind 
of barbarous Pleafurc in the Jealoufy of thofe who love 
them, that infult over an aching Heart, and triumph in 
their Charms which are able to excite fo much Uneafinefs : 
But thefe often carry the Humour fo far, till their afFcded 
Coldnefs and Indifference quite kills all the Fondnefs of a 
Lover, and are then fure to meet in their Turn with all the 
Contempt and Scorn that is due to fo infolent a Behaviour. 
On the contrary, it is very probable a melancholy, dejefted 
Carriage, the ufual EfFedts of injured Innocence, may foft- 
cn the jealous Husband into Pity, make him fenlible of the 
Wrong he does you, and work out of his Mind all thofe 
Fears and Sufpicions that make both Man and Wife unhap- 
py. At leaft M will have this good EfFedt, that he will 
keep his Jealoufy to himfelf, and repine in private, either 
becaufe he is fenfible it is a WeaknciS, and will, therefore, 
hide it from your Knowledge, or becaufe he will be apt to 
fear fome ill EfFe<ft it may produce, in cooling your Love 
towards him, or diverting it to another. 

There is ftill another Secret that can never fail, if you 
can once get it believed, and which is often practiced by 
Women of great Cunning than Virtue : This is to change 
Sides for a while with the jealous Man, and to turn his 
own Paffion upon himfelf; to take fome Occaiion of grow- 
ing jealous of him, and to follow the Example he himfelf 

hath 



hatb let you. Ttus GOUDterfisited Jcaloufy will bring him 
a gFeat deal of Pkafiire^ if he thinks it real ; for he knows, 
experimeotaUy, how much Love goes along with thk PaHi- 
00, aad Willi befides,^ feel Something like the Satisfadion of 
u Revenge, in feeing you undergo all his own Torlure^ 
But this, indeed, is an Artifice ib difficult, and at the iame 
Time lb difingenuou6, that it ought never to be put in 
Praise but by fucb as have Skill enough to cover the Dc* 
ceit, and Innocence to render it excuiable* 

The late Marqudffr of Halli/ax, in his curious Treatiie, 
called. Advice to a Daughter^ has made no mention how 
a Wife is to behave herfelf to the jealous Husband, but 
has given prudent Inflrudions with regard to other Sort of 
Men. 

Women, faith that noble Writer, are to confider they 
live in a Tinae that hath rendered &xnt kind of Frailties fo 
habitual, that they lay ckiim to large Grains of Allowance, 
The World in this is ibmewhat unequal, aiul the mafculine 
Sex feems to play the Tyrant in diflringuifhing partially for 
themfelves, by making that in the utmoft Degree criminal 
in the Wocoan, which in a Man paiTes under a much 
gentler Cenfiire. The Root and the Excufe of this In-^ 
juflice, is the Prefervation of Families from any Mixture 
which may bring a Blemi{h to them : And whilft the Point 
of Honour continues to be fo placed, it feems unavoidable 
to give the Female Sex the greater Share of the Penalty : 
But if in this it lies under any Diiad vantage, it is more than 
recompensed, by having the Honour of Families in their 
Keeping. The Confideration fo great a Trufl muft give 
the Wonoan, makes full Amends ; and this Power the 
World has lodged in them, can hardly fail to reflrain the 

N^6 Q_ Severity 



122 ^ewboIeDvTY ^-^Woman. 

Severity of an ill Husband, and to improve the Kindnefi 
and Efteem of a good one. This being fo, they (hould 
remember, that next to the Danger of committing the 
Fault themfelves, the greateft is that of feeing it in their 
Husbands. They (hould not feem to look or hear that 
Way: If he is a Man of Scnfe, he will reclaim himfelfj 
the Folly of it, is of itfclf fiifficient to cure him : If he is 
not fo, he will be provoked, but not reformed. To ex- 
poftulate in thefe Cafes, looks like declaring War, and pre- 
paring Reprifals ; which to a thinking Husband would be 
a dangerous Reflcdion : Befides, it is fo coarfe a Reafon, 
which will be affign'd for a Lady's too great Warmth up- 
on fuch an Occafion, that Modcfty, no lefsthan Prudence, 
ought to reftrain her : Since fuch an indecent Complaint 
makes a Wife much more ridiculous, than the Injury that 
provoked her to it: But it is yet worfe, and more unskil- 
ful, to blaze it in the World, expcdling it (hould rife up in 
Arms to take her Part : Whereas, (he will find, it can have 
no other EfFedl, than that (he will be ferved up in all Com- 
panies, as the reigning Jeft at that Time, and will con- 
tinue to be the common Entertainment, 'till (he is re(cued 
by fome newer Folly that comes upon the Stage, and drives 
her away from it. The Impertinence of fuch Methods is 
fo plain, that it does not deferve the Pains of being laid 
open. In Cafes of this Kind, the Fair Sex (hould be af- 
fured, that Difcretion and Silence will be the moft pre- 
vailing Reproof. An afFefted Ignorance, which is feldom 
a Virtue, is a great one here : And when a Husband fees 
how unwilling a Woman is to be uneafy, there is no ftrong- 
er Argument to perfuade him not to be unjuft to her: 
Befides, it will naturally make him more yielding in other

fhe will have the good Effcdls of it while it lafts, and all

of prefuming fuch a Behaviour will at lail entirely convert

TH E next Thing we will iuppoie, is, that the Hus-

be granted, that though there are Vices of a deeper Dye, 
there are none that have a greater Deformity than this,, 
when it is not reftrained : But with all this, tne fame Cu*

Condition of human Life, by which it k not intended 
we fliould be quite exempt from Trouble, it is fair, if wc 
can efcape fuch a Degree of it as would opprefs us, and 
enjoy fo much of the pleafant Part as may leifen the ill Tafte 
of fuch Things as are unwelcome to us. Every thing has 
two Sides, and for our own Eafe we ought to dired our 
Thoughts to that which may be leaft liable to Exception. 
To fall upon the worft Side of a Drunkard, gives fo un* 
pleaiant a Profpeft, that it is not poffible to dwell upon it. 
Let us pais then to the more favourable Part,, as far as a 
Wife is concerned in it. 

If the Irregularities of the Expreflion could, in Stridnefs,. 
be juftified, we might fay, That a Wife is to thank God 
her Husband has Faults. Mark the feeming Paradox, 
for your own Inilrcrftion, it teiBg intended ao teither. A 
Husband without Faults is a dangerous Obferver ; he hath 
an Eye fo piercing, and fees -every thmg So plain, that it is 
expoTed to his full Onfore. And tho* a Woman's Virtue 
tnay difappoint the ftiarpeft EnqnirieB, yet few can hear to* 
have all they fay or do Tepr^fented in the clear Glftfe (af aa 
XJriderftandrng without Faal=es. Nothing foficns ithc Ar- 
rogance of our Nature, like a Mixtnre.of foine FraJJitie).

by common Weaknefs and Defe£i)s, which in our corrupt 
State contribute more towards reconciling us to one another, 
than all the Precepts of the Philosophers and Divines : So 
that where the En'ors of our Nature make Amends for 
the Difadvantages of the Women's, it is more their Part 
to make Ufe of the Benefit, than to quarrel at the Fault. 

Thus in Caie a Dmnken Husband falls to a Woman's 
Lot, if (he will be wife and patient, his Wine fliall be 
of her Side ; it will throw a Veil over her Miftakes, and 
wiH fct out and improve every thing ihe does^ that he is 
pleaied mkh. Others will like him lefs, and by that Means 
nc may, perhaps, like his Wife the more. When after 
having dined too wdl, he is received at home without a 
Storm, or fo jjuich as a jeprpacjxfial Look, the Wine will 
fiaturally w^ock out all in Kindnefs,^ which a Wife mufl: 
encourage, let it be wrapped up .iu ^ever fo much Imperti- 
nence. On the other Side, it woujd boil up into Rage, 
if the miftafccn Wife Should treat him roughly, like a cer- 
tain Thing called, ,a kind Shrew, than which the World, 
with all its Plenty, cannot ihew a moce fenfeleis, ill-bred, 
forbidding Creatuje. A Woman fliould confider, that; 
wfaj&re the Man will give fuch frequent Intermiffions of 
the VJk of his^Reafcwi, the Wife infenfibly gets a Right 
of jgoverning in the Vacancy, and that raiies her Charafter 
and Credit in the Family, to a higher Pitch, than, per- 
haps, could be done under a fober Husband, who never 
puts hiiafcif into »n Incapacity of holding the Reins. If 
^e& are npt entire Confolations, at leaf): they are Reme-

thele Means, to make the beft of fuch a Lot, and by the 
help of a wife Obfervation, to make that very fupportable 
which would other wife be a Load that would opprefsthem. 
The next Cafe is, the Misfortune of a Cholerick or ill- 
huinour'd Husband. To this may be faid, That paffionatc 
Men generally make Amends at the Foot of the Account; 
Such a Man, if he is angry one Day without any Caufe, 
will the next Day be as kind without any Reafon : So that 
by marking how the Wheels of fuch a Man's Head are 
ufed to move, a Woman may eafily bring over all his Paf- 
fions to her Party. Inftead of being ftruck down by his 
Thunder, (he may diredt it where and upon whom (he 
{hall think it beft applied. Thus arc the ftrongeft Poifons 
turn'd to the beft Remedies ; but then there muft be Art in 
it, and a skilful Hand, elfe the leaft bungling makes it 
mortal. There is a great deal of nice Care requifite to 
deal with a Man of this Complexion. Choler proceeds 
from Pride, and makes a Man fo partial to himfelf, that 
he fwells againft Contradidion, and thinks he is leilened 
if he is oppofed. Women, in this Cafe, muft take heed 
of increafing the Storm, by an unwary Word, or kindling 
the Fire whilft the Wind is in a Corner which may blow 
it in their Faces : They are dexteroufly to yield every thing 
till he begins to cool, and then by flow Degrees they miay

^Sfjbe whole D.uty of a Woman. 127 

If ill Hamours and Suliennefs, and not open and fudden 
Heat, is his Difeafe, there is a Way of treating that too, fo 
as to make it a Grievance to be endured. In order to it, a 
Woman, in the firft Place, ought to know, that naturally 
good Senfe has a Mixture of Surly in it : And there being 
{6 much Folly in the World, and for the moft Part fo 
triumphant, it gives frequent Temptations to raife the 
Spleen of Men who think right. Therefore, that which 
may be generally called, ill Humour, is not always a Fault ; 
it becomes one, when either it is wrong applied, or that 
it is continued too long, when it is not fo : For this Reafon, 
a Wife muft not too haftily fix an ill Name upon that 
which may, perhaps, not deferve it ; and though the Cafe 
fhould be, that the Husband might too fourly refent any 
thing he difliked, it may fo happen, that more Blame (hall 
belong to her Miftake, than to his ill-Humour. If a Hus- 
band behaves himfelf fometimes with an Indifference that 
a Wife may think ofFcnfive, fhe is in the wrong to put the 
worft Scnfe upon it, if by any Means it will admit a bet- 
ter. Some Wives will call it ill-Humour, if their Hus- 
bands change their Style from that which they ufed whilft 
they made their firft Addrefs to them : Others will allow 
no Intermiflion or Abatement in the Expreflions of Kind- 
ncis to them, not enough diftinguifhing Times, and for- 
getting that it is impoflible for Men to keep themfelves up 
all their Lives to the Height of fpme extravagant Moments* 
A Man may, at fome Times, be lefs careful in little Things 
without any cold or difobliging Reafon for it : As a Wife 
may be too expecting in finaller Matters without drawing 
upon herfelf the Inference of being unkind : And if a Hus- 
band fhould be really fuUen, and have fu'ch frequent Fits,

as might take away the Excufe of k, h conctm^ a Wife to 
have an Eye prepared to difccrn the firft Appearances of 
cloudy Weather, and to watch when the Fit goes off, whicb 
ieldom lafts long if it is let alone: BurwhiJft the Mind is 
fore every thing galfe it ; and that makes it neccffary to lei the 
Black-Humour begin to fpend hfelf before {be conies in, 
and ventures to undertake it. 

If in the Lottery of the World a Woman (hoald draw 
a Covetous Husband, it muft be confefe'd ftie has no great 
Reafon to be proud of her good Luck ; yet even fuch a one 
may be endured too, though there are few Paflions more 
untradtable than that of Avarice. She muft fir ft take Care 
that her Definition of Avarice may not be a Miftake : She 
is to examine every Circumftance of her Husband's For- 
tune, and weigh the Reafon of every Thing flie expeds 
from him, before (he has Right to pronounce the Sentence. 
The Complaint is now fo general again ft all Huibands, that 
it gives great Sui^P^^^^^ ^^ ^'^ being often ill-grounded ; it is 
impoflible they ftiould all defence that Cenfore, a^nd, there- 
fore, it is certain that it is many Times mifapplied. He 
that fpares in every thing is an inexcufable Niggard : He 
that fpares in nothing is an inexcuiable Madman. The 
Meaning is, to ipare in what is leaft necejflary, to lay out 
more liberally in what is more required in our feveral Cir- 
cumftances. Yet, this will not always fatisfy. There are 
Wives who arc impatient of the Rules of Oeconomy, and 
are apt to call their Husband's Kindnefs into queftion, if 
any other Meafurc is put to their Expence than that of 
their own Fancy. A Woman fliould be fore to avoid this 
dangerous Error, fiich a Partiality to herfelf, which is fo 
;ofFenfive to an underftanding Man, that be will very ill 

bear

bear a Wife's giving herfelf fiich an injurious Preference to 
all the Family^ and whatever belongs to it. 

But to admit the worft, and that the Huiband is really 
a clofe handed Wretch, (he muft in this, as in other Cafes, 
endeavour to make it lefs afflidtine to her -, and, firft, fhe 
muft obferve feafonable Hours of ^>eaking, when (he of&rs 
any thing in Oppoiition to this reigning Humour ; a third 
Hand and a wife Friend, may often prevail more than (he 
will be allowed to do in her own Caufe. Sometimes (he is 
dextrouily to go along with him in Things where (he fees 
that the niggardly Part of his Mind is moft predominant, 
by which (he will have the better Opportunity of pcrfuade- 
ing him in Things where he may be more indifferent. Our 
Pafiions are very unequal, and are apt to be raifed or leflen- 
ed, according as they work upon different Objects -, they 
are not to be flopped or retrained in thoie things where 
the Mind is more particularly engaged. In other Matters 
they are more tradable, and will fometimes reafon a Hear- 
ing, and admit a fair Difpute. More than that, there are 
few Men, even in this Inflance of Avarice, fo ientirely 
abandoned to it, that at fbme Hours, and upon fome Oc-- 
cafions, will not forget their Natures, and for that Time 
turn Prodigal. The iame Man who will grudge himfelf 
what is necedary, let his Pride be raifed and he (hall be 
OTofufe; at another Time his Anger (hall have the fame 
Bfied ; a Fit of Vanity, Ambition, and fometimes Kind- 
nefs, ihall open and enlarge his narrow Mind ; a Dofe of 
Wine will work upon this tough Humour, and for the 
Time difTolve it. The Wife's Bufincfs mufl be, if this 
Cafe happens, to watch thefe critical Moments, and not let 
one of man flip, v^ithout making her Advantage of it?

outward Payment of the Confidcration that is due to him : 
Her flighting him in Company, bcfides that it would, to a 
diftrerning By-Stander, give too great Encouragement for 
the making nearer Applications to herfelf, is in itfelf fuch 
an indecent Way of affuming, that it may provoke the 
tame Creature to break loofe, and fliew his Dominion for 
his Credit, which he was content to forget for Eafe. In 
fliort, the fureft and moft approved Method will be, to do 
Kke a wife Minifter to an eafy Prince, firft give him the 
Orders which are afterwards to be received from him. 

With all this, that which flie is to pray for, is a wife 
Husband ; one that by knowing how to be a Mafter, for 
that very Reafon will not let her feel the Weight of it ; 
one whofe Authority is fo foftencd by his Kindnefs, that 
k gives her Eafe without abridging her Liberty ; one that 
will return fo much Tcnderncfs for her juft Efteem of him, 
that (he will never want Power, tho* (he will feldom care 
to ufe it. Such a Husband is as much above all the other 
Kinds of them, as a rational SuWedion to a Prince, great 
in himlelf, is to be preferred before the Difquiet and Un- 
eafinei&of unlimited Liberty. 

A little muft be added to this Head, concerning a Wife's 
Behaviour to her Husband's Friends, which requires the 
moft refined Part of her Underftanding to acquit herfelf 
well of it. She is to ftudy how to live with them, with 
more Care than how to apply to any other Part of Life ; 
efpecially at firft, that ftie may not ftumble at the firft fet- 
ing out. The Family into which flie is grafted will ge-

Country, (he (hould conform to their Methods, and not 
bring in a new Model by her own Authority. The Friends, 
in fuch a Cafe, are tempted to rife up in Anns as againft aa 
unlawful Invafion ; fo that (he is with the utmoft Caution 
to avoid the leaft Appearances of any thing of this kind. 
And that (he inay, with, leis Difficulty, afterwards give her 
Diredtions, (he muft be fure, at firft, to receive them from 
her Husband's Friends. Let her gain them to her by early 
applying to them, and they will be fo (atisfy'd, that as no- 
thing is more thankful than Pride, when it is complied 
with, they will ftrive which of them fhall moft recom- 
mend her : And when they have helped her to take root 
in her Husband's good Opinion, (he will have lefe Depcn- 
dance upon their?, tho' (he ought not to negledl any reafon- 
able Means of prefcrving it. She i& to cgnfider, that a 
Man governed by his Friends, is very eafily inflamed by. 
them ; and that one who is not fo, will, yet, for his owa 
Sake, expedttQ have them confidered. It is- eafily improv-^ 
ed to a Point of Honour in a Husband, not to haue hi& 
Relations negledled ; and nothing is more dangerous, thaa 
to raife an Objedion, which is grounded upon Pride :. It is 
the moft ftubborn and lading Pailion we are fubjeft to,, 
and where it is the firft Caufe of the War, it is very hard 
to make a fecure Peace. A Wife's Caution in this is of 
the laft Importance to her. 

And that (he may the better llicceed in it, (he (hould 
carry a ftrid Eye upon the Impertinence of her Servants y 
and take heed that their ill Humour may not engage her 
to take Exceptions, and their too much a(ruming in fmalL 
Matters, raife Confequenccs which may bring her under 
great Difadvantages. She (hould remember that in the

this may be the Cafe of every new-married Woman, and,

plied, the Negleift of them is amongft thofe Faults which 
are not forgiven, and will bring her under a Cenfure, which 
will be much a heavier thing than the Trouble (he woukJ 
avoid. Of this Kind, is the Government of her Houfe, 
Family, and Children ; which fince it is the Province allot- 
ted to the Female Sex, and that the difcharging it well, 
will, for that Reafon, be expeded from the Woman; if 
fhe cither dcfert it out of Lazinefs, or manage it ill for 
want of Skill, inftead of a Help {he will be an Incum- 
biance to the Family where (he is placed. 

No Re:^<ft is lafting but that which is produced by 
our being in fome Degree ufeful to thofe that pay it. 
Where that fails, the Homage and the Reverence go along 
with it, and fly to other-s where fomething may be expedted 
in exchange for them : And upon this Principle the Re- 
fpedls even of the Children and the Servants will not ftay 
with one that does not think them worth their Care ; and 
the old Houfe-Keeper (hall make a better Figure in the 
Family, than the Lady with all her fine Cloaths, if flic 
wilfully relinquiflies her Title to the Government. There- 
fore, let her take Heed of carrying her good Breeding to 
fuch a Height, as to be good for nothing, and to be proud 
of it. Some think it has a greater Air to be above trouble- 
ing their Thoughts with liich ordinary things as their Houfe

the greatcft Princes can do, at once to preferve Refpcft, 
and to neglect their Bufincfs. No Age ever erefted Altars to 
infignificant Gods : They had all fome Quality applied to 
them to draw worihip from Mankind ; this makes it the 
more unreafonable for a Lady to expert to be confidered, 
and at the fame Time refolve not to deferve it. Good 
Looks alone will not do, they are not fiich a lading Te- 
nure as to be relied upon; and if they fliould ftay longer 
than they ufually do, it will by no Means be faft to depend 
upon them : For when Time has abated the Violence of 
the firft liking, and that the Napp is a little worn off, tho* 
AiU a good Degree of Kindnefs may rqmain, Men re- 
cover their Sight which before might be dazzled, and al-

136 ^e whole Duty of aWoMAU^ 

Children and Family may now and then have a Random 
Thought, but {he never takes Aim but at fomething very 
impertinent. When a Husband, whofe Province is with- 
out Doors, and to whom the Occonomy of the Houfe 
would be in fome Degree indecent, finds no Order nor 
.Quiet in his Family, meets with Complaints of all kinds 
Ipringing from this Root, the miftaken Lady, who thinks 
to make Amends for all this by having a well-chofen Petti- 
coat, will at laft be convinced of her Error, and, with 
<jrief, be forced to undergo the Penalties that belong to 
thofe who are willfully infignificant. . When this fcurvy 
Hour comes upon her, Ihe nrfl grows angry ; then when 
the Time of it is pafl, would, perhaps, grow wifer, not 
remembring that we can no more have Wifdom than 
Grace, whenever we think fit to call for it. There are 
Times and Periods fi^ed for both j and when they are too 
long negleifted, the Punifhment is, that they are irrecover- 
able, and nothing remaining but an ufelefs Grief for the 
Folly of having thrown them out of our Power. A Wo- 
man ought to think what a mean Figure fhe makes, when 
flie is fo degraded by her own Fault j whereas there is no- 
thing in thofe Duties which are expedted from her, that 
can Be a leilening to her, except her want of Condud: 
makes it fo. She may love her Children without living in 
the Nurfery, and may have a competent and diicreet Care 
of them, without letting it bre^k out upon the Company, 
or expofing herfelf by turning her Difcourfe that way, 
which is a kind of laying Children to the Parifh, and it 
can hardly be done any where, that thofe who hear it will 
be fo forgiving, as not to think they are overcharged with 
them. A Woman's Tendernefs to her Children, is one of

the Icaft deceitful Evidences of her Virtue ; but yet the 
Way of cxprcfling it, muft be fubjefl to the Rules of good 
ftxeding : And though a Woman of Quality ought not to 
be leis kind to them, than Mothers of the meanefl Rank 
are to theirs, yet fhe may diflinguifh herielf in the Man-' 
ner, and avoid the coarfe Methods which in Women of a 
lower Size might be more excufable. She muft begin early 
to make them love her, that they may obey her. This 
Mixture is no where more necelTary than in Children, and 
a Mother is not to expe£t Returns of Kindnefs from thern^ 
without Grains of Allowance ; and yet, it is not fo much a 
Defed in their Good Nature, as a fhortnefs of Thought in 
them. Their firft Infiifficiency makes them lean fo entire- 
ly upon their Parents for what is neceifary, that the Habit 
of it makes them continue the i^me Expeditions for what 
k unreafonable ; and as often as they are dehy'd, fb often 
they think they are injured: And whilft their Reaibn's 
yet in the Cradle, their Anger looks no farther than the 
Thing they long for and cannot have ; and to be difpleafed 
£oir their own Good, is a Maxim they are very flow to un-* 
deriland : So that it may be concluded, the nrft Thoughts 
of Children will have no fmall Mixture of Mutiny ; which 
being fo natural, a Parent ihould not be angry unleis (he 
would increafe it. She fhould deny them as &idom as (he 
can, and when there is no avoiding it, fhe mufl do it 
gently, fhe mofl flatter away their ill-Humonr, and take 
the next Opportunity of pleafing them in fome other 
thing, before they either alk or look for it : This will 
ibei^then her Authority, by making it foft to them, and 
confirm their Obedience, by ^making it thdr Intereft. A

They are apt to make wrong Inferences, to take En- 
couragement from half Words, and mifapply what (he may 
fay or do, fo as either to leflen their Duty, or to extend 
their Liberty farther than is convenient. She fhould keep 
them more in Awe of her Kindnefs than of her Power r 
And above all, take Heed of fupporting a favourite Child 
in its Impertinence, which will give Right to the reft of 
claiming the fame Privilege, If {he has a divided Number, 
let her leave the Boys to the Father's more peculiar Care^. 
that {he may, with greater Juflice, pretend to a more im- 
mediate Jurifdi<5tion over thofe of her own Sex. She is to 
live fo with them that they may never choofe to avoid her, 
except when they have offended, and then let them tremble, 
that they may di{lingui{h : But their Penance muft not con- 
tinue fo long as to grow too four upon their Stomachs, that 
it may not harden in{lead of correcting them : The kind 
and fcvere Part mufl have their fcvcral Turns {eafonably 
applied ; but your Indulgence is to have the broader Mix- 
ture, that Love, rather than Fear, may be the Root of 
their Obedience. 

Servants are in the next Place to be confidered ; and a 
Woman mu{l remember not to foil into the Mi{lake of 
thinking, that becaufe they receive Wages, and are fo 
much inferior to her, therefore, they are below her Care to 
know how to manage them. It would be as good Reafon 
for a Mafter Workman to defpife the Wheels of his En- 
gines, becaufe they are made of Wood* Thefe are the 
Wheels of a Family ; and let her Diredtions be never {b-

and them, muft not make her forget, that Nature makes 
no fuch Diftindiion, but that Servants may be looked upon 
as humble Friends, and that Returns of Kindnefs and 
good Ulage, are as much due to fuch of them as deferve it, as 
their Service is due to us when we require it. A fooliQi 
Haughtineis in the Style of fpeaking, or in the Manner of. 
commanding them, is in itfelf very indecent; beiides that 
it begetteth an Averfion in them, of which the leaft ill 
£ffe6t to be expected is, that they will be (low and careleis 
in all that is enjoined them : And (he will find it tme by 
her Experience, that flic will be fo much the more obey'd 
» ihe is lefs imperious. She fhould not be too hafty in give- 
ing her Orders, nor too angry when they are not altoge^ 
ther obferved, much lefs is fhe to be loud, and too much 
diifairbed: An Evennefs in diflinguifhing when they do 
well or ill, is that which will make her Family move by a 
Rule, and without Noiie, and will the better fet out her 
Skill in condu&ing it with Eafe and Silence^ that it may 
be like a well-diiciplined Army, which knows how to an- 
ticipate the Orders that are fit to be given them. A Wo- 
man is never to negled the Duty of the prefent Hour, to 
do another thing, which though it may be better in itfelf, 
is not to be unfeaibnably preferred. She muft allot well- 
cboien Hours for the Infpediion of her Family, which may 
be fo diftinguiihed from the reft of her Time, that the ne« 
ceiiary Cares may 'come in their proper Place, without any 
Influence upon her good Humour, or Intermption to other 
things. By thefe Methods {he will put herfelf in Pofteflion 
of being valued by her Servants, and then their Obedience 
"Will naturally follow.

fuch, as by failing either in the Time or Meafiire of it,

well examined, there is more Money given to be laugh'd 
at, than for any one thing in the Worid, tho' the Purchases 
do not think &>. A well ftated Rule is like the Line, when 
it is once pafled, we are under another Pole ; ib the firft 
ftraying from a Rule, is a Step towards makii^ that which 
was before a Virtue, to change its Natare, and ^to gpow 
either into a Vice, or at leaft an Impertinence. The Art

dance there^ give 311 ft Cdufe to the leaft Servant fhe has, to

let her fix it in her Mind an unchangeable Maxim, Thzt 
nothing is tpaly fine, but what is fit, and that juft (o much 
as js proper ^for her Circumftances of their federal Kinds, 
is much finer tha<n all ftic can ackl «o it. 'When (he once

of fixtravagance ; every thing will become necefl&ry, be- 
cawfe ihe has a mind to it, not becaufe it is ik for her but 
becauife fome-bedy elfe has it. This Lady's Logic fets 
Sica£>n upon its Hea<l, by carrying the Rwle from Things 
10 i^fons, and appealing from what is right to every Fool 
that n in the wpong. The Word necejfarj is raiferably 
applied, it diforders Families and overturns Government,. 
by 'being fo abufed. Let her remember, that ChiMren and 
Foods wjtnt every thing, becaufe they want Wit to iliftin- 
gaifti ; and, Aertfore, there is no ftronger Evidence ©f a

logue of Things neceflary, when in Truth there are fo very 
few Things that have a Right to be placed in it. Try 
every thing firft in your Judgment before you allow it a 
Place in your Defire j or a Husband may think it as necefla- 
ry for him to deny, as it is for his Wife to have whatever 
is unreafonable ; and if (he (hall too often give him that 
Advantage, the Habit of refufing may, perhaps, reach to 
Things that are not unfit for her. 

There are unthinking Ladies, who do not enough con- 
fider, how little their own Figure agrees with the fine 
Things they are fo proud of. Others when they have 
them, will hardly allow them to be vifible ; they cannot 
be ieen without Light, and that is many times fo faucy 
and fo prying, that like a too forward Gallant, it is to be 
forbid the Chamber. Some, when one is ufhered into their 
dark Ruelky it is with fuch Solemnity, that a Man would 
fwear there was fomething in it, till the unskillful Lady 
breaks Silence, and begins a Chat, which difcovers it is a 
Puppet-Play, with magnificent Scenes. Many efteem 
Things rather as they are hard to be gotten, than that they 
are worth getting : This looks as if they had an Intereit: 
to purfue that Maxim, becaufe a great Part of their own 
Value depends upon it. Trath in theie Caies would be 
often unmannerly, and might derogate from the Preroga- 
tive great Ladies would afTume to themielves, of being 
diftindt Creatures fi-om thofc of their Sex, which arc in- 
ferior, and of lefs difiicult Accefs. 

In other Things too, the Condition of a Woman muft 
give Rule to her, and, therefore, it is not a Wife's Part to,, 
aim at more than a bounded Liberality ; the farther Ex- 
tent of that Quality, otherwilib to be commended* belon£&

to the Hufband, who has better Means for it. Generofity 
wrong placed becomes a Vice : It is no more a Virtue whea 
it grows into an Inconvenience : Virtues muil be enlarged or 
reftrained according to differing Circumftances. A Prince- 
ly Mind will undo a private Family : Therefore, Things 
muft be fuited, or clfe they will not deferve to be com- 
mended, let them in themfelves be never fo valuable : And 
the Expectations of the World are beft ^nfwered, when we 
acquit ourfelves in that Manner which feems to be pre- 
icrib'd to our feveral Conditions^ without ufurping upon 
tbofe Duties, which do not fo particularly belong to us. 

We willclofe theConfiderationofthisArticleof Expence, 
with this fhort Word, Do not fetter yourfelf with fuch a 
Reftraint in it as may make you remarkable, but remem- 
ber, that Virtue is the greateft Ornament, and good Senfe 
the beft Equipage* 

Never recede from the Principles of Virtute, npr re- 
gard them only as eftabliflied by Cuftom ^ there are two 
Tribunals before which you muft expcft to appear^ 
your Confcience and the World : You may efcape the 
World, but never your own Confcience. You owe to 
yourfelf the Teftimony of jrour Merit; however, you 
fhould not abandon publick Approbation, becaufe from a. 
Contempt of Reputation, rifes a Contempt of Virtue. 

A Woman, if ftie thought right, would know, that it is 
not neceflary to be deterr'd by Laws, to oblige her to con- 
tain herfelf within the Bounds of her Duty : The Examples 
of thofe who deviate from it, and the Misfortunes which 
immediately fiicceed, are forcible enough to put a Stop to 
t^ mcA violent Inclination : And, perhaps, there is no 
Woman of Gallantry whatever, but were ihe fincere„

would confefs, that the greatcft of her Misfortunes was to 
have forgotten her Duty. 

• From a Scnfe of Shame, if well managed, many Ad- 
vantages may be reaped. We fpeak not of that ShanM 
that troubles our Repofe, without contributing to the Im^ 
provement of our Manners, but of that which prevents 
our doing ill, for fear of Difhonour. This Shame is fbme- 
times the moft faithfol Guardian of Female Virtue : Few 
alafs ! are virtuous now-a-Days, for Virtue's Sake ! 

Great Virtues atone for a great many Defecfts : Supreme 
Valour in Men, and extreme Modefly in Women. Every 
thing was pardoned in Agrippina^ Wife of Germanicus, 
m favour of her Chaftity : This Princefs was ambitious 
and proud; but, fays Tacitus, All her Pajfions were con^ 
fecrated by her Chaftity. 

If a V^oman is fenfible and delicate on the Score of Re- 
putation ; if (he fears to be attacked on the eflential Vir- 
tues, there is a fiire Means to calm her Fears, and content 
her Delicacy : It is to be virtuous. Let her think of puri- 
fying her Sentiments, while they are reafonable and foil 
of Honour, (he may refolve to be contented in herfelf ; it 
is a certain Revenue of Pleafures ; if (he be truly virtuous, 
(he will not fail of being applauded*

TH E next State that can fuccccd to that of Marriage, 
is Widowhood, which, tho' it fuperfedes thole 
Duties which we terminated merely in the Peribn of the 
Hufband, yet, it endears thoie which may be paid to his 
Aihes. Love is Jirong^ as Death. Cant. viii. 6. and there- 
fore, when it is pure and genuine, cannot be extinguifhed 
by it, but burns like the Funeral-Lamps of old, even in 
Vaults and Charnel-Houfes. The conjugal Love tranf^ 
planted into the Grave, as into a finer Mould, improves in- 
to Piety, and lays a kind of facred Obligation upon the 
Widow, to perform all Offices of Refpedt and Kindneis 
which his Remains are capable of. 

Now thofe Remains are of three Sorts, his Body, his 
Memory, and his Children. The moft proper Expreflion 
of her Love to the Firil, is in giving it an honourable In- 
terment ; we mean not fiich as may vie with the Poland 
Extravagance, of which it is obierved, that two or three 
near £icceeding Funerals ruin the Family, but pmdently 
proportioned to his Quality and Fortune, fo that her 
Zeal to his Corpie may not injure a nobler Relidt of him, 
his Children : And this Decency is a much better Inftance 
of her Kindnefs, than all thoie tragical Furies wherewith 
ibme Women ieem tranfported towards their dead Hus- 
bands, thofe frantic Embraces and Careiies of a Carcafs, 
which betray a little too much the Senfuality of their Love: 

N o 7 T And 



And it is fomething obfervable, that thofe vehement Pafli- 
ons quickly exhauft thcmfelves, and -by a kind of fympa- 
thetic Efficacy, as the Body -(on which their Aflfeftion was 
fix'd) moulders, fo doth that alfo ; nay, often it attends not 
thofe leifurely Degrees of Diflblution, but by a more pre- 
cipitate Motion, feems rather to vanifli than conlume. 

The more valuable Kindnefe theirfore, is, (3haft to his 
Memory, endeavouring to embalm than, keep it from 
|)eri{liing -, and by tliis innocent Mci^ic (as the ^Egyptiam 
nvere wont by a naoi^ giiihy) ftie may >converfe with the 
Dead, reprefent him io to her <xwn Thoughts, that his Life 
may ftill be repeated ^to her : And asin a broken Miqwin,

Thefe he leaves as his Proxies to receive the Kindnefs of 
which himfelf is uncapabte ; fo that the Children of a Wi*^ 
dow may ckim a double Portion of the Mother's Love ; 
one upon their native Right as hcr's ; the other, as a Be- 
queft in Right of their dead Father : And, indeed, fince 
fhe i» to fupply the Place of both Parents, it is but neceC- 
fery £hc fhould put on the Affeftions of both,, and to the 
Tendernefi of a Mother, add the Care and Condudt of 1 
Father. Firfi^ In a fedulous Care of their Education ; 
MF^ ncxt^ in a prudent Managery of their Fortunes ; an 
Order that is fbmetimes unhappily inverted, and Mothers 
are fo concerned to have the Eftatc pro^)er in their Tuition^ 
dtait the Children cannot; whilf): (by an unieafonable Fra* 
gality) to fiive a little Expence, they deny them the Advan** 
tages of an ingenious and genteel Breeding: Swell their 
Eflates, perhaps, to a vaft Bulk, but fo contraA and nar^ 
row their Minds, that they know not how to di^ofe them 
te any real Ben^ of themielves or others : And this is 
one of the moft pernicious Parfimonies imaginable. A 
Mother, by this, teems to adopt the Fortune, and abdi- 
cate the ChiWj who is only made the Beaft to bear thofe 
Loads of Wealth (he wHl lay on, and which fhe evidently^ 
owns as the greateft Treafure, fince in Tendernefe to that 
fhe negledts him. 

Yet finnetimes the feme Effedt fprings from another 
Caufe, and Children arc ill bred, not becaufe the Mother 
gradges the Charge, but out of a Feminine Fondnefe, 
wincn permits her not to part with them to Ae proper

Places for their Education : Like J aco6 to Benjamin^ her 
Soul is (o bound up in them, that me cannot lend them a 
while, even, to tneir own moft neccflary Concerns : And 
this, tho' not fo ignoble a Motive as the other, is of xuy 
leis Mifchief, at leaft, to her Sons, who being by it con- 
fined to Home, are coniequently condemned to be poifbn- 
ed, if with nothing elfe, yet, with the Flatteries of Servants 
and Tenants, who think thofe the beft Expedient to iecure 
their own Station : And with thcfe the young Maftcr or 
Landlord is fo blown up, that as if his Manors were the 
Confines of the World, he can look at nothing beyond 
them, fo that when at laft he breaks loofe from his Mo- 
ther's Arms, and comes Abroad, he experts icarce to find 
his Equals, much leis his Betters ; thinks he is ftill to re- 
ceive the fame fawning Adorations which he was uied to at 
Home : And being pofTefs'd with this infolent Expectation, 
he will fcarce be undeceived, but at the Price of many 
Affronts : Nay, perhaps, he may buy his Experience with 
the Lofs of his Life ; by his ill Manners draw on a Quar- 
rel, wherein he finally perifhes. That this is no impofii- 
ble Suppofition, fome unhappy Mothers have found to their 
unfpeakable AfHi£tion. 

It is not to be denied, but there are alio Dangers con*: 
fequent to the breeding Children Abroad, Vice having in- 
finuated itfelf, even, into the Places of Erudition, and 
having not only as many but the very fame Academies with 
Virtue and Learning j fo that the extreme Depravation of 
the Times new ilates the Queilion j and we are not to con- 
fider which is beil, but which is the leafl ill-difpofure of 
Children : And in that Competition, fure the home Edu-

^vA nothing of the Anditote ; they will not only be taught 
baie things, but, as is before obferved, by the baleft Tutors, 
iiich as will add all the moft fordid Circumftances to the 
improving of a Crime. Whereas, Abroad thw are, firft, 
not like to meet with any whofe Intereil it is io much to 
make them vicious : And, Secondly, they may (as ill as 
the World is) meet with many who may give them both 
Precepts and Examples of a better Kind ; befides, the Dif- 
cipline ufed in thoie Communities makes them know them- 
ielves; and the various Sorts of Learning they may acquire, 
will not only prove ufefiil Divertifement (the want of which 
is the great Spring of Mifchief ) but will, if rightly ap- 
plied, furnifh them with ingenious and virtuous Principles, 
fuch as may fet them above all vile and ignoble Practices. 
So that there feems a Confpiration of Motives to wrefl the 
Child from the relucting Mother, and to perfuade her for 
a while to deny herielf that Defire of her Eyes, that fo he 
may at laft anfwer the more rational Defire of her Heart. 

As to the other Part of her Obligation, the managing 
of their Fortune, there is the fame Rule for her as for all 
other Perfons that have a Truft, wz. to do as for them- 
felves ; that is, with the fame Care and Diligence, if not a 
greater, as in her own peculiar Concern. We do not fay, 
that {he ihall confound the Property, and make it, in- 
deed, her own, by applying it to her peculiar Ufe : A Thing 
which it is to be feared, is often done, efpecially by the 
gayer Sort of Widows, who, to keep up their own Equi- 
page, do fometimes incroach upon their Son's Peculiar; 
And we wifli even that (tho* bad enough) were the only 
Cafe wherein it were done ; but 'tis fometimes to make her 
a better Prize to a fecond Huiband. She goes into another

Family, and as if (he were a Colony fent out fey her Son, 
he m«ft pay for the planting her there. Indeed, the oft re- 
peating this Injury, has advanced it now into a Cuftom,. 
and the Management of the Minor*e Eftate is reckoned on* 
as Part of the Widow's Fortune : But it is not eafy to fee 
what there ie in the Title of a Mother, that can legitimate 
her defrauding her Child; it rather envenoms theCrime^ 
and adds Unnaturalnefs to Deceit. Befides, 'tis a prcpofte- 
rous Sort of Guilt. Orphans and Widow? are in Scripture 
link'd together as Objedls of God's and good Men's Piety 
and of ill Men's Oppreflion, and how ill, alas, does civil 
War look amoi^ Fellow Sufferers ? The Widow to injure 
the Orpham, is like the uncooth Oppreffion Solomon fpeaka 
of, Prov. xxviii. 3. A poor Man that oppreffetb the Poor 
is like a Jhveeping Rain which leaveth no Food. Such kind 
of Rapines are as exceflive in their Degree, as prodigious 
ifi their Kind : And we believe there are many Inftances of 
Sons, who have foffered more by the Guardianfhip of their 
Mothers than they could probaWy have 6onc by the Out- 
rage of Strangers. 

How well mch Mothers anfwer their Obligations to other 
dead Hufi^ands, muft be left to their own Confciences to 
difeufi, we ftiall only offer thenr thefe Steps of Gradatioa 
by which to pnx:eed. Firjl^ That Injuftice of any Sort is

Reftraint from any other inconfiftent Obligation, but may

her Husband's Right., feem now to devolve on God, the 
grand Proprietor of our Time ; that Difcourfe and free 
Converfe wherewith {he entertain'd him, (he may now 
convert into Colloquies and fpiritual Intercourfe with her

the Change of its Objedt acquires a Sublimity, is exalted 
into Divine; from loya^ Duty and conjugal AfFeaion 
becomes the eternal Work and Hapmnefs of Angf Is, the

AneuUhy but a* Work of Mercy is produced not only with

not whether it may prove a Blefling or a Curfe , but Cha- 
ritv gives certain Title to a Blefling, and engages the moft 
folvent Paymafter, even God himfelf, who owns all fuch 
Disburfements as a Loan to him. He that hath Pity upon 
the Poor J lendetb unto the Lord : And that which he hath 
given will he fay him again. Prov. xix. 17. 

There was, in the Primitive Times, an Ecclefiaftical Or- 
der of Widows^ which St. P^z^/ mentions, i 37w. v. whofe 
whole Miniftry was devoted to Charity. They were in- 
deed, of the poorer Sort, fit rather to receive than give 
Alms, yet, the lefi they could do with their Purfes, the 
more was required of their Peribns, the humbler Offices 
of wafhing the Saints Feet, the careful Task of bringing 
up Children, and a diligent Attendance on every good 
Work : And fure there is parity of Reafon, that thote who 
upon the Score of their Wealth, . exempt themfelves from 
thoie laborious Services, (hould commute for it by more li- 
beral Alms. In the Warmth and Zeal of Chriftianity, 
Women of the highefl Quality performed both Sorts of 
Charity, forgot their Greatnefs in their Condefcenfions, 
yet afliim'd it again in their Bounty ; founded Hofpitals, 
and yet with a Labour of Lovey as the Apoftle ftiles it^ 
Heh. vi. 10. difdain'd not fometimes to fcrve in them: But 
thefe are Examples not like to be tranfcrib'd in our Days,

Now certainly, if any Women be oualified to avert this 
Reproach, it muft be the Dowagers ol great Families and 
Fortunes : They have none to controul their Vifits to the 
Sick and Affli6:ed, or to rcfent a Difparagement from their 
Humility, neither have they an Account to give of their 
Poffeffions to any but God and thcmfelvcs ; to him liirc 
they can bring none fo like to procure them the Eulogy 
of well done tmuj^ood and faithful Servant y Math, xx v. 7,1^ 
as a Catalogue of their Alms. Nor, indeed, can they any 
other way difpofc their Fortune fo much to their own Con- 
tentment ; they may poifibly cloy and iatiate their Senfes,^ 
make Provifion for tne Flefh ; but that no way iatisfies 
their Reafon, much lefe their Conscience. The Soul, 
which is the fuperior Part, is quite left out in that Diftri- 
bution 5 nothing is communicated to it but the Guilt of 
thoie dear bought Exccflcs. The only way it has to be a 
Sharer in their Wealth, is by a charitable difpenfing. The 
Poor are its Proxies as well as God's, and tho' in all other 
Refoeds we may fay to the Soul, as the Pfelmift does to 
God, My Goods extend not to thee : Yet, by this way, it 
becomes not only a Partaker, but the chief Proprietor, and 
all is laid out for its Ufe. The harbouring an Out-caft, 
builds it an everlajiing Habitation. The Qoathing the 
Naked, arrays in pure white Linen ; and the Feeding the 
Hungry, makes it a Gueft at the Sufter of the Lamb. 
Nay, it gains not only an indefeafible Title to thefe happy 
Reverfions, but it has a great deal in prefent Poflcffion, a 
huge rational Complacence in the right applying of Wealth, 
and doing that with it for which it was dcfigned. Yet 
more, it gives a fcnfitive Delist, nothing being more a- 
grecable to human Nature, thao doing Good to its own 

Kind.

Gally-Slaves^ who play away their Liberty as £x)n as they 
regain it. 

\ Marriage is fo great an Adventure, once feems enough 
for the whole Life ; for whether they have been profperous 
or adverie in the firft, it does almoft diicourage a fecond 
Attempt. She that has had a good Huiband, may be fup« 
pofcd to have his Idea fo fix'd in h^ Heart, that it will be 
liard to introduce any new Form : Nay, farther, fhe may 
very reafonably doubt, that iii this common Dearth of 
Virtue, two good Huflbands will fcarce fall to one Woman's 
Share, and one will become more intolerable to her, by 
the Refledbns fhe will be apt to make on the Better. On 
the other Side, if {he' have had a bad, ths Smart, ^e, ican- 
not but remain after the Rod is takeii off 5 the Memory of 
what (he has fuffercd fhould, one would think, be a com- 
petent Caution againft new Adventures; yet. Experience 
fhewsus, that Women, the* the weaker Sex, have common- 
ly Fortitude enough to encounter and baffle all thefe Con* 
ndcrations. It is not, therefore, to be expected that many 
will, by any thing that hath or can be faid, be divertdd 
from remarrying : And, indeed, (ha that does not preferve 
her Widowhood upon the Accounts afore-mentioned, may, 
perhaps, better relinquifh it. St. Paul^ we fee,, advifes, 
riiat thofe Widows who found n<J better Employraenf than 
going from Houfe to Houffy that grew^ by their Vacancy, 
to be Tatters and Buff-hodieSy 1 Tim. v. 13. fhould marry 
again, it being the beit way to fix thefe wandering Planets, 
to find them Bufinefs of their own at Home, that fo they 
may not ramblfe Abroad to intermeddle with; ti)at of others :

Gravity, whkh becomes a Widow, had better put them- 
ielves in a State that lefs requires it ; and if they refolve not 
to conform their Minds to their Condition, to bring their 
Condition to their Minds : But in the doine that, there will 
be ibme Cautions very necelSary to be obterved. We (hatl 
reduce them to two, the one relating to the Time> the 
other to the Equality of the Match. 
. Firft in refpeffc of Time, common Decency requires 
that there be a confiderable Interval between the parting 
with one Husband and the choofing another. This has 
been fo much obferved by Nations, that were at all civiliz'd, 
th^t we find Numa made it a Law, that no Widow fhould 
m:arry under 10 Months, and if any did, fhe was to iacri* 
fice as for the Expiation of a Crime : And this continued 
in force many Ages after, infomuch, that when upon Rea* 
ions of State Augufius found it ufcful to marry his Sifter 
O^avia to uintoniusy nothing lefs than a Decree of the ^ 
Senate could licence the anticipating the Time > fo jealous^ 
Obi^rvers were they of this Point of Civility, that they 
thought (he whole State was concerned in the Violation. 
It is true we have no Law in tb^ Cafe, but we have fome** 
what of Cuftom, tho* it is uncertain how long it rnay laft, 
fince the frequent Breaches of it threaten quite to cancel it : 
Yet, a.Wpnaan that is tender of her Honour will fcarce 
give her Example towards the rcicinding it. The Wounds 
of Grief are feldom healed by any Hand but that of Time, 
and, therefore, too fudden a Cure (hews the Hurt pierced 
not deep; and {he that can make her. Mourning Veil an 
Optic to draw a new Lover nearer to her Sight, gives Caufc 
to fufpe^ the Sables were all without* 

The

The next Thing confiderable, te, the Equality of the 
Match. Marriage is fo clofe a Link, that to have it cafy it 
is good to have the Parties as even proportioned as may be : 
And, Firft, In refpeft of Quality and Fortune, it is to be^ 
wiihed there fhould be no eminent Difprc^ortion. Thofe 
that meet moft upon a Level, are leaft fiibje^il to thofe Up- 
braidings that often attend a great Deicent of either Party. 
It is, therefore, no prudent Motive, by which fome Wi- 
dows are fway'd who marry only for a great Title, who- 
often do not meet with fo much of Obeifanc« from Stran- 
gers, as they do with Contempt from their Husband and 
lis Relations. There have been Examples of Lords, who 
have ufed rich, but inferior Widovirs like Spunges, fqueez*d 
them to fill themlelves with their Wealth, and them only 
with the Air of a big Name. On the other Side, for a 
Woman to marry very meanly too much below herfelf, it 
rather worfe ; thoie kind of Matches are ordinarily made 
in a tranfport of Paflion, and when that abates and leaves* 
her to ibber Refleftions, ihe will probably be fo angry with 
herielf, that {he will icarce be well pleafed with her Hus- 
band. A State of Sulne^on is a little fweetned by the 
Worth and Digni^ of the Ruler ; for as it is more ho« 
nourable, ib 'tis alio more eaiy, the ferviler Spirits being, 
of all others^ the moft imperious in Command : And, 
fiire, 'twill not a little grate a Woman of Honour, to think 
fhe has made fiich a one her Mafter, who, perhaps, would 
before have thought it a Preferment to have been her Sw« 
rant : Nay, farther, fuch Marriages have commonly an ill 
Refledtion on the Modefly of the Woman, it being ufiiaUy 
prefum'd that where the Diftance was fb ^'eat, as tp di^^ 
courage fuch an Attempt on his Part, there was fome In- 
vitation 



TM'wboleDvTY of a Woman. 159 

Titation on hcr's : So that upon all Accounts flic is very 
fbrlom who thus diipofes 01 herfelf. Yet it is too well 
known iiich Matches have oft been made, and the &me 
Levity and Inconfideration may betray others to it ; and, 
thererore, it is their Concern well to ballaft their Minds, 
and to provide that their Paflion never get the Afcendant 
over their Reafon. 

Another very neceflary Equality is, that of their Judge- 
ment as to Religion. We do not mean that they are to 
catechize each other, as to every minute fpeculative Point ; 
but that they be of the fiime Profcflion, fo as to join toge- 
dicr in the Worfliip of God. It is fore very uncomfortable 
that thofe who have fo clofcly conbined all their other In- 
tcrefts, fliottld be difunited in the greateft ; that one Church 
cannot hold them, whom one Houfe, one^Bed does; and 
that Religion which is in itfelf the moft uniting thing, 
ihould be the onlv Difegreement between them. It is very 
true, it is often made a Compadt in foch Matches, that 
neither fliall impofe their Opinion upon the other : Yet, it 
is to be doubted, that this is but feldom kept, unlefi it be 
by thofe whofe Carelcfsnefs of all Religion abates their 
Zeal to any one : But where they have any Earneftnefs in 
their Way, cfpeciallv where one Party thinks the. other in 
a damnable Error, it will fcarce be poflible to refrain en- 
deavouring to reckice them 5 and that Endeavour begets 
Dilputcs, thofe Difputes Heats, thofe Heats Diigufts, and 
thofe Difgufts, perlKips, end in Averiion ; fo that at laft 
their AfFeftions grow as unreconcileable as their Opinions, 
and their religious Jars draw on domeftic. Beudes, if 
none of thefe perfonal Debates happen, yet the Education 
of the ChHdren will be Matter of Difputc j the one Pa-

rent will ftill be countermining the other, each feeking to 
recover the other's Profelytcs : Nay, it introduces Fadtion 
into the inferior Parts of the Family too : The Servants, 
according to their different Perfuafions, bandy into Leagues 
and Parties ; fo that it endangers, if not utterly deftroys all 
Concord in Families; and all this Train of Miichiefs 
{hould, methinks, be a competent Prejudice againft fuch 
Matches. 

There is yet a third Particular wherein any great Difpror 
portion is much to be avoided, and that is in Years. The 
Humours of Youth and Age differ fb widely, that there 
had need be a great deal of Skill to compofe the Difcord 
into a Harmony. When a young Woman marries an old 
Man, there are commonly Jealoufies on the one Part, and 
Loathings on the other, and if there be not an eminent 
Degree of Difcretion in one or both, there will be perpe- 
tual Difagreements. But this is a Cafe that does not often 
happen among thofe we now fpeak to j for tho' the Ava- 
rice of Parents fometimes forces Maids upon fuch Matches^ 
yet. Widows, who are their own Choofers, feldom make 
fuch Eledions. The Inequality among them commonly 
falls on the other Side, and old Women marry young Men. 
Indeed, any Marriage is in fuch, a Folly and Dotage. 
They who mufl fuddenly make their Beds in the Dufl, 
what ftiould they think of a Nuptial Couch ? And to fuch 
the Anfwcr of the Philofopher is appofite, who being de- 
manded what was tlie fitteft Time for marrying 3 replied^ 
For the Toung not yet^ for the Old not at alL 

But this Dotage becomes perfedt Frenzy and Madnefs 
when they choofc young Husbands ; This is an Accumula- 
tion of Abfurdities and ContradiAions. The Husband

and tlie Wife are bat one Perfon ; and yet at ofite young 
atid old, frefli and withened. It is fcverfing the Decrees of 
Nature: And, therefore, it was no ill Anf^er which 
DiMyfiks the Tyrant gave his Mother, who in her Age 
ck(kned fiK:h a Match, ^Tbat tbo' iy his regal Ptmer be 
cwU dij^nfe neitb pofitiw Laws^ yet, be could fiot Abrogate 
fbo/e i3j Nature, or make it Jit for her, an old IFoman, 
tc marry a young Man. It is, indeed, an Inverfion of 
Seafons, a con^founding the Kalendar, niaking a mongrel 
Month of May in December : And the Conjundion (>n>ves 
as fatal as k is prodigious ; it being fearce ever fwn that 
iilch a Match proves tolerably happy : And, indeed, it Sa 
not imaginable how it fliookl ; for, firft, it is to be pre- 
fiimed, that fhe who marries fo muft marry meanly. No 
young Man who does not need her Fortune will take her 
Perfon. For tho' fome have the Humour to give great 
Rates for inanimate Antiquities, yet, none will take the 
Living gratis. Next, (he never miffes to be hated by him 
file marries : He looks on her as his Rack and Torment, 
thinks himfelf under the lingering Torture devifed by Me- 
Tsef^iUi, a living Body tied to a Dead. Nor muft (he think 
to care this by any the little Adulteries of Art : She nmy 
buy Beauty, and, yet, can never make it her own ; may 
paint, yet, never be fair. 'Tis like enameling a mud Waif, 
the Coariarieis of the Ground will fpoil the VarnUh ; and the 
greateft Exquifitnefs of Dre&, ierves but to illuilrate her 
tiative Blemiihes. So that all (he gains by this^ is^ to make 
him Icom as well as abhor her. 

fodoed, there is nothing can be more ridknilous, than an 
eld Wottian gaily fet out ; and it was not tinapdy (aid of

you are deceived \ if for the Dead^ make Hajie to them : 
AnAy without Doubt, many young Hufbands will be ready 
to fay as much : Nay, becaufe Death comes not quick 
enough to part them, there are few have Patience to attend 
its loitering Pace : The Man bids adieu to. the Wife tho' 
not to her Fortune, takes that to maintain his Luxuries 
elfewhere, allows her fome little Annuity, and makes her 
a Peniioner to her own Eftate : So that he has his Defign, 
but {he none of ^^her's : He married her Fortune, and he 
has it ; (he for his Perfon, and has it not : And which is 
worfe, buys her Defeat with the Liofs of all, he common- 
ly leaving her as empty of Money as he found her of Wit. 
And truly this is a Condition deplorable enough, and, 
yet, ufiially fails, even, of that Comfort which is the lafl 
Referve of the Miferable, viz. Pity. It is the wifi? Man's 
Queftion, Ecclufxu. 13, JVbo mU pity a Charmer that is

Cliarms, that (he {hould exped by them ^o fix the giddy 
Appetites of Youth ? and fince {he could fo prefiime with- 
out Senfe, none will regret that fhe {hould be convinced by 
Smart : Befides, this is a Cafe wherein there have been a 
Multitude of unhappy Precedents which might have cau- 
tioned her. He that accidentally falls down an undiicovci*-

tnily, (he who cafts hcrfelf away ia fiich a Match, betrays 
not kfe, but more Wilfulriefs. How many Ruins of un- 
happy Women prcfent themfelves to her, like the Wrecks 
of old Veflels, all fplit upon this Rock ? And if (he will 
needs fleer her Courfe purpofely to do the £ime, none 
ought to grudge her the Shipwreck (he (b courts. 

Nor has (he only this negative Difcomfort to be depriv'd 
of Pity, but (he is loaded with Cenfures and Reproach. 
The World is apt enough to malicious Errors, to fix Blame 
where there is none, but 'tis feldom guilty of the Chari- 
tative, does not overlook the fmalleft Appearance of 
Evil, but generally puts the worft Conftrudtioa on any 
AGt that it will, with any Probabihty, bear -, and according 
to that Meaiiare Women in this Condition can expert no 
very mild Defcants on them. Indeed, fuch Matches are 
fo deftitute of any rational Plea, that 'tis hard to derive 
them from any other Motive than the Senfitive. What 
the common Conje<^ures are in that Cafe, is as needlefs as 
it is unhandfome to declare : We will not (ay how true they 
are, but if they be, it adds another Reafon to the former^ 
why (iich Marriages are fo improfperous. All Diftortions 
in Nature are ufually ominous i and, fure, fuch preterna- 
tural Heats in Age, may very well be reckon'd as difmal 
Pre(age$, and very certain ones too, (ince they create the 
Ruin they foretel. And truly, 'tis not only juft, but con- 
venient, that fuch Motives (hould be attended with fuch 
Con(equences ; that the Bitternefs of the one may occafion 
fome Refledtion on the Sordidnefs of the other. It is but 
kindly, that fuch an Alhallontide Spring (hould meet with

who arc confcious of the one, ihould be very thftfikfiil for 
the other, thmk it God's Difcipline to bring them again to 
their Wits, and not repipe at tnat Smart which themielyes 
have made necefi^. 

And now we wifh all the ancienter Widows, would 
ferioufly weigh how much it is their Intereft not to fever 
thofe two Epithets ; that of Ancient they cannot put off, it 
daily grows upon them ; and that of Widow is^ fnre, a 
more proportionaablc Adjund: to it, than that of Wife ; 
cipeciaily when it is to one to whom her Age might have 
made her Mother. There is a Veneration due to Age, if 
it be fuch as difowns not itfelf : 72^ boary Head^ iays Sobh 
many is a Crown of Glory y if it be found in tbe Way of 
RighteoufnefSy Prov. xvi. 31. but when it will mix itfelf 
with Youth, it is difclaimed by both, becomes the Shame 
of the Old, and the Scorn of the Young. What a ftrange 
Fury is it then which poffefles fuch Women, that when 
they may difpofe their Fortunesto thofe advantageous De- 
figns before-mentioned, they fhould only buy with them, 
fo indecent, fo ridiculous a Slavery ? that when they may 
keep up the Reputation of Modefty and Prudence, they 
fhould expofe thcmfelves to an univcrial Contempt for the 
want of both 5 and that they who might have had a Re- 
verenoej^ put themfelvcs, even, out of the Capacity of 
bare Compaflion. 

This is fo high a Frenzy, as, furc, cannot happen in an 

Inftant} k muft have fome preparatory Degrees, fbme 

rooting in the Conilitution and Habit of the Mind. Such 

Widows have,^ fure, fome lightnefs of Humour, before

' the Canfe j ff they will ftill be wishing themfel ves joun?, 'tis 
Odds, but within a while they will perfiiade themtelves 
they arc fo. Let them, therefore, content thenafelves to 
be old, and as Fafhions are varied with Times, fo let them 
put on the Ornaments proper to their Seafon, which are. 
Piety, Gravity, and Prudence. Thefe will not only be 
their Ornament, but their Armour too; this will gain 
them fiich a Reverence, that will make it as impro- 
bable they {hould be afiaulted, as impoiiible they (hould 
aflault* For, we think, one may fafely fay, It is the want 
of one, or all of thole, which betrays Women to fuch 
Marriages. 

And, indeed, it may be a Matter of Caution, even to 
the younger Widows, not to let themfelvcs too much loofe 
to a light firotick Humour, which, perhaps, they will not 
be able to put off when it is moft neceflfary they (hould. 
It will not much invite a fober Man to marry them while 
they are young ; and if it continue with them 'tiU they are 
old, it may, as natural Motions ufe, grow more violent 
towards its End : And precipitate them into that ruinous 
Fcdly we have before confidered. Yet, fliould they happen 
to e&ape that, fhould it not force them from their Widow- 
hood, it will, fure, very ill agree with it ; for how prepo^ 
terous is it for an old Woman to delight in Gauds and 
Trifles, fech as were fitter to entertain her Graiid-Children ? 
ta read Romances with Spedacles, and be at Maflcs and 
I>ancings, when ibe is fit only to adt the Antics ? Thefe 
are Contradictions to Nature, the tearing off her Marks, 
and where flic has writ fifty or fixty, to lefien, beyond the 
Proponioii of the unjuft Steward, and write fixteen : And

fbn to bewail it at laft than at firft, as having more ex- 
perimentally found the Mifchief of being left to their own 
Guidance. It will, therefore, concern them all to put 
themfelves under a 6fer Condu<a, by an aiTiduous Devotion 
to render themfelves up to the leading of the one infallible 
Guide, who, if he be not a Covering of the Eyes^ Gen. 
XX. 16. to preclude all fccond Choices, may, yet, be a 
. Light to them for difcerning who are fit to be chofcn ; that 
. if they fee fit to ufe their Liberty and marry, they may, 
yet, take the Apoftle's Reftridkion with it, i Cor. vii. 39. 
that // be only in the Lord ; upon fuch fobcr Motives, and 
with fuch due Circumftances as may approve it to him^ 
and render it capable of ^ his Benediftion. 

We have now gone thro* the feveral Parts of the Me- 
thod propofed. The Firft has prefented thofe Qualificati- 
ons which are equally neceflary to every Woman. Thefe 
as a Root, fend Sap and Vigour to the diftindt Branches, 
animate and impregnate the feveral fucceflive States thro' 
which (he is to pafs. He that hath pure Ore or Bullion^ 
may caft it into what Form beft fits his Ufe ; nav, may 
tranflate it from one to another ; and (he who nas that 
Mine of Virtues, may furnifli out any Condition ; her be- 
ing good in an abfblute Confideration, will certainly make 
her fo in a Relative. On the other Side, (he who has not 
fuch a Stock, cannot keep up the Honour of any State ; 
like corrupted Liquor, empty it from one Vcflcl to another, 
it ftill infedts and contaminates all. And this is the Cauie 
that Women are alike complained of under all Forms, be- 
caufe fo many want this fundamental Virtue : Were there 

more 



^be HvboIeDvTY of a Wom ah. if&j 

more good Women, there would be more modeft Virgins, 
loyal and obedient Wives, and fober Widows. 

We muft, therefore, intreat thofe who will look on this 
Book, not only to fingle out that Part which bears their 
own Infcription, but that they think themfelves no lefs con- 
cerned in that which relates indefinitely to their Sex ; en* 
deavour to poflefs themfelves of thofe Excellencies, which 
fhould be as univerfal as their Kind ; And when they are fb 
ftor'd with Matter, they may leave Providence to diverfify 
the Shape, and to afCgn them their Scene of Action. 

And now, would to God it were as eafy to perfuade, as It 
is to propoie, and that this Difcourfe may not be taken 
only as a Gazette for its Newnefs, and difcarded as foon as 
read 3 but that it may at leaft advance to the Honour of an 
Almanack, be allowed one Year ere it be out of Date ; and 
in that Time, if frequently and ferioufly confultcd, it may, 
perhaps awaken fome Ladies from their flupid Dreams, 
convince them, that they were fent into the World for 
nobler Purpofes, than only to make a little glittering in it, 
like a Comet, to give a Blaze, and then difappear : And, 
truly, if it may operate but fo far as to give them an effec- 
tive Senfe of that, we (hall think it has done them a con* 
iiderable Service. They may, for certain, from that Prin- 
ciple, deduce all nccejflary Confequences, and we wifti they 
would but take the Pains to draw the Corollaries ; for thofe 
Indudtions they make to themfelves, would be much more 
efficacious than thofe which are drawn to their Hands. 
Propriety is a great Endearment: We love to be Profelytes 
to ourfelves> and People oft refift others Realbns, who 
would, upon mere Partiality, pay Reverepce to their own. 

But 



But befides this, there would be another Advantage, 
if they could be but got to a Cuftom of confidering, by 
it they might infenlibly undermine the grand Irtftrument 
of their Ruin. That carclefs Incogitancy, fo remarkably 
frequent among all, and not leaft among rcrfons of Quali* 
ty, is the Source of innumerable Mifchiefs ; *tis the Deii* 
lab, that at once lulls and betrays them ; it keeps them in 
a perj)emal Sleep, binds up their Faculties, fo that, the* 
they are not extinft, yet they become ufelefe. Pfato ufed 
to fay, "That a Man ajleep was good for nothing 5 and 'ti$ 
certainly no lefs true of this Moral Drowfinefs than the 
Natural : And as in Sleep the Fancy only is in motion, fo 
ihefe inconfiderate Perfons do rather dream than difcourfe, 
entertain little trifling Images of Things which arc prefentcd 
by their Senfes, but know not how to converfe with their 
Reafon. So that in this drowfy State, all Temptations 
come oh them with the feme Advantage, with that of 1 
^ief in the Night ; a Phrafe by which the Scriptune ex- 
preues the moft inevitable unforefeen Danger, i ^The/s. v. 2. 
We read in Judges, how eafily Laijh became a Prey 
to a handful of Men, merely becaufe of this fupine neg- 
ligent Humour of the Inhabitants, which had cut them off 
from all Iniercourfe with any whom might have liiccour'd 
them : And certainly it gives no lefi Opportanity to our 
ipiritual Afiailants, leaves us naked and unguarded to re- 
ceive all their Impreflions. How prodigbus a thing is it 
then^ that this State of Dulnefs and Danger fhould be ef- 
fedledly chofen ? yet wfe fee it too often is, even by thofe

for. Labour is looked on as utterly incompatible with Great-* 
nei£, and Coniideration is look'd on as Labour of tho 
Mind; and there are ibme Ladies who feem to reckon it as 
a Prerogative to be exempted from both ; will no more 
apply their Underftandings to any ferious Diicuflon^ than 
their Hands to the Spindle and DiftafF, the-one they think 
pedantick, as the other is mean. In the mean time, by . 
what ftrange Meafures do they proceed? they look on 
Ideots as the moft deplorable of Creatures, bccaufe th^y 
want Reafon s and, yet, make it their own Excellence and 
Preheminence to want the Uie of it; which is, indeed, fo 
much worie than to want the thing, as Sloth is worfe than 
Poverty, a moral Defeat than a natural : But we may fee 
by this^ how much civil and facred ^imates differ; for 
we find the Bereans commended, not only as more diligent, 
but as more noble too, A£is xvii. 1 1. becauie they atten- 
tively con/idered and ftriftly examined the Do^rine preach' d 
totbem: By which they may difcern, that in God's Court 
of Honour, a ftupid Ofcitancy is no ennobling Quality^ 
however it comes to be thought fo in theirs. 

And if this one Point might be gain'd, if they would 
but fo far actuate their Reafon, as deliberately and duly to

fuadcd to fly it : And, fure, did they but clearly diicern 
what a Sting there is in thofe vicious Follies they embrace, 
their Fear would make them quit their Hold, put them in 
fuch a trembling, as would, like that of Beljhazzar\ 
flacken their Joints, and make thofe things drop from 
them, which before they moft tenacioufly grafoed. For, 
indeed, in Sin there is a Conlpiration of all that can be 
dreadful to a rational Being, fb that one may give its Com- 
pendium by the very Reverfe of that which the Apoftlc 
gives of Godlinefs, i Tim. iv. 8. for as the one has the Pro- 
mifesy fo the other has the Curfes of this Life^ and of thai 
to come. 

In this Life, every depraved A61, much more Habit, 
has a black Shadow attending it : It cafls one inwards up- 
on the Confcience in uncomfortable Upbraidings and Re- 
grets. It is true, indeed, feme have the Art to difguife 
that to themfelves by cafting a yet darker over it, fup- 
preffing all thofe Reludings by an induftrious Stupefaction, 
making their Souls fo perfeft Night, that they cannot fee 
thofe black Iniages their Confeiences reprefent : But as this 
renders their Condition but the more wretched, fo neither 
can they blind others tho' they do themfelves. Vice cafts 
a dark Shadow outwards too. not fuch as may conceal, but 
betray itfelf : And as the Evening Shadows increafe in 
Dimenfion, grow to a Monftrofity and Diiproportion, fo 
the longer any ill Habit is continued, the more vifibfe, the 
more deform'd it appears, draws more Obfervation and 
more Cenfiire. 

'Twerc, indeed, cndlefs to reckon up the temporal Evils 
to which it expofes its Votaries. Immodefty deftrOys their 
Fame, a vain Prodigality their Fortune, Anger makes

them mad. Pride hateful. Levity renders them defpis'd, 
Obftinacy deipcrate, and Irreligion is a Complication of all 
thefe, fills up their Meafure both of Guilt and Wretched- 
neis. So that had Virtue no other Advocate, her very An- 
tagonift would plead for her ; the miierable Confequences 
of Vice, would, like the Flames of Sodomy fend all con- 
iidering Perfons to that little Zoar, which how deipicable 
ibever it may have appeared before, cannot but look in- 
vitingly when Safety is infcrib'd on its Gates. 

But it muft infinitely more do fo if they pleafe to open a 
Vifto into the other World, make ufe of divine Perfpec- 
tives to difcern tbofe diftant Objeds which their grofier 
Senfes do here intercept. There they may fee the difmal 
Cataftrophe of their Comedies^ the miferable Inverfion of 
all unlawful or unbounded Pleafures : There that prophetic 
Menace concerning Babylon^ which we find Rev. xviii. 7. 
will be literally verified upon every unhappy Soul, accord'- 
ing as (he exalted berfelf and lived delicately ^ Jo much the 
more Tribulation give her : The Torment of that Life will 
bear Proportion to the Pride and Luxuries of this. It will, 
therefore, be neceflary for thofe who here wallow in Plea- 
fiires, to confront to them the Remembrance of thoie Ri- 
vers of Brimftone, and ask themfelves the Prophet's Que- 
AioD, JVbo can dwell with everlajiing Burnings ? We find 
Ijaiahy when he denounces but temporal Judgments againfl 
the Daughters of Zion^ exactly purities the Antithefis, and 
to every Part of their efieminate Delicacy he oppofes the 
dired contrary Hardfhip, inftead oi Jweet Smells there /hall

It were well the Daughters of our Zion would copy out 
this Lefture, and prudently forefee how every particular 
Sin or Vanity of theirs will have its adapted Puni(hment 
in another World : And, fure, this Coniideration well di- 
geftcd, muft needs be a forcible Expedient to cleanfe them 
from all Filthinefs of Flejh and Spirit^ as the Apoftle fpeaks 
2 Cor. vii. I. For is it poflible for her to chcriin and blow 
up her bidinous Flames here, who coniiders them but as 
the firft Kindlings of thofe inextinguiihable ones hereafter ? 
Gan (he make it her Study to pleafe her Appetite, that re- 
members that Diveses unintermitted Feafts ends in as un- 
allaiable a Thirft ? Or can fhe deny the Crumbs of her 
Table to that Lazarus, to whom (he forcfecs ihe {hall then 
fupplicate for a Drop of Water ? In fine, can {he lay out 
her whole Indu{lry, her Fortune, nay, her Ixigenuity too» 
in making Provifion for the Flefli, who coofiders, that 
that Fltih will more cormpt by pampering, and breed the 
Worm that never dies? Certainly no Woman can be fp. 
defperately daring, as thus to attack Damnation, refift her 
Rea{bn and her Senfe, only that fhe may ruin her Soul; 
and unlefs (he can do all this, lier Forefight will prove her 
Efcape, and her viewing the bottomlefs.Pit in Landskip,and 
Piifture, will fecore her from a real Ekfcent into it. 

But now that this Tra<ft may not make^ it& Exit in the 
Shape of a Fury, bring the Meditations to Hell and. there 
leave them, it muft: now at laft (hift the Scene, and as it has 
Ihew'd the Blackncfs of Vice by that outer Darknefs to 
which it leads, we aUb will let in a Beam of the celeftial 
Light to difcover the Beauty of Virtue ; remind the Read* 
er that there is a Region of Joy as well as a Place of Tor- 
men t^, aod Piety and Virtue is that n^ilky Way that l^ds

to it ; a State, compared to which the Elyfium of the 
Heathen is as inconfidcrable as it is fictitious, the Mahome- 
tan Paradife as flat and as infipid as it is grofs and brutilh ; 
where the Undertaking of the Pfalmift (hall be completely 
anfwered, tixf/e that fear the Lord JbalJ want no Manner 
of' thing that is good^ Pfalm. xxxiv. 10. And this happy 
State is as accefljble as excellent. God is not unfincere in 
his Proposals, offers not theie Glc^ies only to tantalize and 
sbufe us, but to animate and encourage Mankind. He fets 
up an inviting Prize, and not only marks out, but le- 
vcls the Way to it ; makes that our Duty which is alfo our 
Plcafiire, yea, and our Honour too. So has he contrived 
for our Eaie, that knowing how hardly we can diveft our 
Yohiptuoufnefs and Ambition, he puts us not to it : All he 
demands is but that he may choofe the Obje^s, and in that 
he is yet more obliging, for by that at once he refines and 
fatisfics the Defires': He takes us off, indeed, from the 
ftthbme Plcafures of Senfe, which, by their Groflhefs, may 
cloy, yet, by Reafon of their Emptineis, can never fill us ; 
and brings us to tafte the more pure fpiritual Delights which 
are the tme Elixir of Pleafares, in Comparifon whereof 
all the Senfual are but as Dregs or Faeces in an Extraction, 
after the Spirits are drawn off. In like Manner he calls us 
from an afpiring to thofc Pinnacles of Honour, where we 
always fit tottering and often fall down, but, yet, invites 
i>6 to ibar higher, where we fhall have the Moon with all 
her Viciffitudes and Changes under our Feet. Rev, xii. 1 . 
and enjoy a Grandeur as irreverfible as fplendid. 

Thus does he fhcw us a Way to hallow our mo ft unfandi-

and thus may all thofe Feminine Paflions. which now fe- 
duce Women from Virtue, advance them in it.. Let her 
that is aniorous, place her Love upon him who is (as the 
Spoufe telis us, Cant, v, 10.) the chief efl among ten thou^ 
fand\ ihe that is angry, turn her Edge againft her Sins; 
flie that is haughty, difdain the Devil's Drudgery ; (he 
that is fearful, dread him who can dejlroy both Body and 
Soul in Helly Matt. v. 29. and flie that is fad, referve her 
Tears for her penitential Offices. Thus may they confe- 
crate even their Infirmities ; and tho' they cannot deify, or 
ered: Temples to them, as the Romans did to their Paffions, 
nay, their Difeafes; yet, after they are thus clean fed, they 
may lacrifice them as the yews did the clean Beafts in the 
Tabernacle. Only Irreligion and Profanenefs is exempt 
from this Privilege, no Water of Purification can cleanie 
it, or make it ferviceable in the Temple, that like the Spoils 
of yerichOy is fo execrable, that it muft be devoted to De- 
ftrudtion, as an accurfed things yof. vi. 17. For tho' God 
does not defpife the Work o his own Hands, hath fo much 
Kindnefs to his Creatures, that he endeavours to reduce all 
our native Inclinations to their primitive Rcftitude, and, 
therefore, does not abolifh, but purify them ; yet, Aiheifm 
is none of thole, it is a Counterblafl from Hell, in Oppo- 
fition to that mighty Wind in which the holy Spirit dc- 
fcended. Tho' the Subjcdt in which it fubfifts may be re- 
formed, the Perlbn may turn Chriftian, and the Wit that 
maintained its blafphemous Paradoxes may be converted to 
holier Ufes, yet the Quality itfelf is capable of no fiich 
happy Metamorphofis ; that muft be extirpated, for it can- 
not be made tributary : Which (hews how tranfcendent an

111 that is which cannot be converted to Good, even that 
Omnipotence which can, out of the very Stones, raife 
Children to Abraham^ attenipts not any Tranfmutation 
of this ; which ought, therefore, to poffefs all Hearts with 
a Deteftation of it, and advance them in an earnefl Pur« 
fuit of all the Parts of Piety. 

And that is it which we would now once more, as a 
farewel Exhortation, commend to our Female Readers, as 
that which virtually contains all other Accomplifhments ; 
it is that Pearl in the Gofpcl for which they may part with 
all and make a good Bargain too. The Fear of the Lord 
is the Beginning of Wijdomy fays the Wifeft of Men, Prov. 
i. 7. and by his Experience he (hews, that it is the com* 
pleting End of it too ; for he no fooner declined from that, 
but he grew to Dotage and Difhonour. Let all thofe, 
therefore, to whom God has difpenfed an outward Afflu- 
ence, and given them a vifible Splendour in the Eyes of the 
World, be careful to fecure themfelves that Honour which 
comes from God only^ John v. 44. unite their Souls to that 
Supreme Majcfty who is the jfountain of true Honour; 
who, inhisbeftowingtheCrownof Righteoufnefs, proceeds 
by the fame Meafures by which he difpos'd the Crown of 
Ifrael^ when he avow'd to Samuel^ that he looked not on the 
outward Appearance hut beheld the Hearty i Sam. xvi. 7. 
If God fee not his own Image there, all the Beauty and 
Gaiety of the outward Form is defpicable in his Eyes, like 
the Apples of Sodomy only a kind of painted Duft : But 
if Piety be firmly rooted there, they then become, like the 
King's Daughter, all glorious within too ; a much more 
valiiic^ble^ Bravery than the Garment of Needle Work and

Water, and fo long a Time, *till the Liquor will make a 
ftrong Jelly when it is cold : This you may try by taking 
out a imall Spoonfiil now and then, and letting it cool. 
Here it is to be fuppofed, that tho* it will jelly prefently in

extracted ; however, when you find it very ftrong, ftrain 
the Liquor through a Sieve, and let it fettle ; then providQ

glazed Earthen Ware \ fill theie Cups with Jelly taken 
clear from the Settling, and fet them in a Stew-pan of Wa-

thick as Glue : After which, let them ftand to cool, and

by boiling about a Pint of Water, and pouring it upon a

there is nothing of Sealbniftg in this Soop, fo there may be 
always added what you defire, either of Spices <x Herbs, to

may a bifli of good Soop be made without Trouble, only 
allowing the Proportion of Cake Gravy anfwering to thea*-*

with it ; and then the Outfide Part of the Liver, being a 
little hard, will feel to the Mouth like the Claws of the 
Crab broken and picked, and the inner Parts will be foft 
and tender, like the Body of a Crab. One may ferve this 
cold, and it will deceive a good Judge, if you do not put 
too much of the Anchovy Liquor in it. It is very good 
cold ; but if yon would have it hot, tal^e the following 
Receipt. 

To make artificial hot buttered Sea-Crabs. 

MAKE the great Sheik of Crabs clean, and pre^ 
pare fome Liver, as before ; or if you cannot get 
Calf's Liver, get a Lamb's Liver, era young Sheep's Liver 
will do tolerably well. Boil theie, .andr Aired them as di* 
red:ed before, and put a little Anchovy Liquor to them ; 
then add a little White Wii^c, fome Pepper and Salt at 
pleafure, and fome other Spice at Difcretion, with Butter 
neceflary to make it mellqw, over a gentle Fire, or a little 
Sallet Oil, if yOu like Oil. Then add a little Lemon Juice

and Salt, ferve it upon Sippets, garnifhed with fliced Le-

the firfl is rather the bed. 

To make artificial 'Loh^tts. 

PRaftice the fame Method with either of the former; 
and to imitate the Tail of the Lobfter, put in the 
Tails of Shrimps, Buntings, Prawns, or Crawfi(h ; the 
laft cut in Pieces, and ferve them either upon Sippets in a 
PJate, or in the large Shell of the Lobfter. 

This is a fort of Salmy, or Salmy-Gundy, as they call 
it in England j but is very much like the thing we want : 
and we think if the Shrimps, or others, were put into the 
firft, it would make it better than putting in the Anchovy 
Liquor ; but if they are to imitate a Crab^ they mufl chop 
the Shrimps or Prawns very fmall.

Ingredients as you fill the Gut : After you have made as 
many Links as you defign, tie them in Bunches, then put 
them into a Kettle of boiling Water, and let them boil 
half an Hour ; obferve that vou prick the Links with a

A particular Manner of Jiewing Chickens or Rabbits. 

GE T two, three, or four Chickens, about the Big- 
ncfs of a Partridge, and boii them 'till they are half 
done : Then take them off, and cut them into little Pieces, 
feparating the Joint-Bones one from another ; let not the 
Meat be minced, but cut into great Slices, not fe exadly, 
but more or leis ; the Breaft Bones are not fo proper to be 
put in : However^ put the Meat, together with the other 
Bones (upon which there muft alfo be fome Meat remain- 
ing) into a good Quantity of that Water or Broth wherein 
the Chickens were boiled \ and fet it over a Chafing Di(h of 
Coals, between two Difhes, that fo it may ftew on "till it 
be fuUy enough, but firft feafbn it with Salt, and grofi 
Pepper, and afterwards, add Oil to it, more or lefs accord- 
ing to the Goodnefs thereof. A little before you take the 
Meat from the Fire, put in fuch a Quantity of Juice of 
Lemons as ma^ beft agree with your Tafte. This makes 
an excellent Difh of Meat, which is to be ferved up in the 
Liquor j and though for a Need, it may be made with 
Butter inftead of Oil, and with Vinegar inftead of Le- 
mon Juice, yet^ is the other incomparably better for fuch 
as have not an Averiion for Oil. The iame Difh may be 
alio made of Veal, orPartric^e, or Rabbits ^ and indeed, 
1^ beft of them all is Rabbits, if they be fo dreis'd before 
Micbaebnas ; for afterwards they grow . rank ; fince though 
they are fetter, yet the Flefh is more hard and dry.

gentle Fire, with frefli Butter, Salt, Pepper and Nutmeg, 
and Cloves pounded in a Mortar ; add to this a Bunch of 
Parfley, young Onions and Thyme, with a Leaf of Bays. 

When you are almoft ready to ferve, pound in a Mortar 
fome blanch'd fweet Almonds, fome candy'd Lemon Peel, 
Biskets, Bitter Almonds, Yolks of hard Eggs, and a con- 
venient Quantity of Sugar: Mix all thefe Ingredients to^ 
gether with a little Orange-Flower- Water ; and having in- 
corporated this Compofition with your Puree of Artich^cSi 
fet it a Moment over the Fire, and then ferve it up. 

Artichokes being of great life in Co o k e r y, thiough- 
out the whole Year, £or almoiifc all Sorts of Ragoos, Soops, 
&c. it* is peceffary to lay in a good Provifion of them by 
obferving the following Direction. 

fo keep Artichokes all the Tear. 

GE T a Quantity of Water proportionable to your 
Number of Artichokes, fo that they may keep in it, 
and boil it with as much Salt as you judge neceilary : Then 
take it off the Fire, and let it {land *till the Fouloefs of the 
Salt be fettled at the Bottom s then pour it into the Yt&X 
in which you intend to keep your Artichokes : Blanch thon 
in boiling Water, only fo long, that you may take out 
the Choaks ; wafh them in two or three feveral Waters, 
'till you are fure they are very clean, then put them mco 
the Pickle you have already made for them, pooringn 
the Top of it fome Oil or good Butter, that lio Air any!. 
entfer : And, if you will, you may put a little Vinegar to 
your Pickle. Cover your Veffel very carefully withPa* 
per, and lay a Board over it, that the leaft Breath of Air 

may 



Ithe whdf Jixfrr of aWoM AH, 4,^ 

nay not get in. When you would uie your Artichokes 
you muft fteep them in frdh Water to take away the Salt. 
They will keep in this Manner a Year or more. 

Artichokes ni»y likewife be kept dry : To this En4, 
when you have blanched them and taken out the Chokes, 
as, above dire<3:ed/ lay then) a draining on Grates qr Hurdle* 
of Oficr J then put them into an Oven moderately ho^ 
'till they become as dry as Wood : Before you ufc them^ 
you muft fteep them for two Days in luke-warm Water i 
by which Micans they will qowc tp themiely^s^ and be as 
Mtfli tB when they wei^ firft gathered. Ja blanching theqt 
off, put 10 the Wa«er a little Verjuiop, Salt ai>d 3vcter, (if 
Igood Beef Sewet. 

Thece is iikewiie another Way of keeping them : CboQ^i: 
At beft Artichokes you can get ; and with a (harp Knife 
cut off the Lfiavoi 90A Chokes^ and throw each j^ottpm 
immediately into fair Wattr» otbfirwift they will tur^i 
l>lack. Wnen yoq itake them out pf the Wateie, Ithroif 
(them into Plour, and rover them all over with it> |liert 
range them one by one on a Hurdle, and dry theiji in the 
Oven. When you would make ufe of them, lay them firft 
a foakiftg for twenty four Hours, and th^n boil thenci as 
you do other Artichokes. You will find that by this Means 
ll^ey will never have loft their Tafte.

IN a Fore Quarter of Lamb, mind the Neck Vein ; if 
it be an Azure Blue it is new and good, but if greeniOi 
or yellowiih it i$ near tainting, if not tainted already. In 
the Hinder Quarter, imeli under the Kidney, and try the 
Knuckle ; if you meet with a faint Scent, and the Knuckle 
be limber, it is ftale killed. For a Lamb's Head, mind 
the Eyes, if they beiimk or wrinkled,, it is ftale^ if plumb 
and livelvy it is new and fweet. 

Veal. 

if the Bloody Vein in the Shoulder look bloc, or a 
bright Red, it is new kiUed ; but if blackiih>. greeniflb of 
ycfiowiih, it is flabby and ftale ^ if wrapt in wet Cloaths, 
fincll whether it be naufty or not. The Loin firft taints 
under the Kidney, and the Flefb, if ftale killed,, will be 
foft and flimy. 

The Breaft and Neck taints firft at the upper End, and 
you will perceive fome dusky yellowifli or greenifli Ap- 
pearance s the Sweetbread on the Breaft will be clammy ^ 
otherwife it is frefli and good : The Leg is known to be 
new by the Stiffiaefe of the Joint, if limbo:, and the Flefh 
icems clammy, and has^ green or yellow Specks 'tis ftale.. 
The Head is known as tte Lamb's. The Flefh of a Bull 
Calf is more red and firm than that of a Cow Calf> and 
the Fat more hard and curdled.

Mutton. 
If Mutton be young, the Flefti will pinch (sender; if old, 
it will wrinkle and remain fo : If young, the Fat will eafily 
part from the Lean ; if old, it will ftick by Strings and 
Skins : If Ram-Mutton, the Fat feel fpungy, the Flelh 
clofe grained and tough, not rifing again, when dented by 
your Finger; if Ewe-Mutton, the Flcfh is paler than 
Weather-Mutton, a clofer Grain, and eafily partmg. If 
there be a Rot, the Flefh will be palifli, and the Fat a 
faint whitifti, inclining to yellow, and the Flefh be loofc 
at the Bone ; if you iqueeze it hard, fome Drops of Wa- 
ter will ftand up like Sweat ; as to newnefs and ftaleoeis^ 
the fame is to be obferved as by Lamb. 

If it be right Ox-Beef it will have an open Grain, if 
young, a tender and oily finoothnefs: If rough and ipuogy 
it is old, or inclinbg to be (o^ except Neck, Brifcuit, and* 
fuch Parts as are very fibrous, whicn in young Meat will 
be more tough than in other Parts. A Carnation plea- 
fant Colour betokens good fpending Meat, the Sewet a 
curious white, yellowilh is not fo good. 

Cow-Beef is lefs bound and clofer grained than the Ox, 
the Fat whiter, but the Lean fomewhat paler, if youngs 
the Dent you make with your Finger will rife again in a 
little Time. 

Bull-Beef is of a cloier Grain, a deep dusky led, tough 
in pinching, the Fat skinny, hard, and has a rammifh 
rank fmell, and for newnefs or ftalenefs this Flefh, boi^ht' 
frefh, has but few Signs, the moft material is its Clam-

Pork. 

If it be young, the Lean will break in pinching be- 
tween your Fingers, and if you nip the Skin with your 
Nails, it will make a Dent ; alfo if the Fat be ibft and pul- 
py, in a Manner like Lard, and if the Lean be tough 
and the Fat flabby and fpungy, feeling rough, it is old, 
efbecially if the Rind be ftubborn, and you cannot nip it 
with your Nails. 

If of a Boar, tho' young, or of a Hog, gelded at full* 
Growth, the Flefli will be hard, tough, reddifli, and 
rammifh of Smell s the Fat skinny and hard, the Skin very 
thick and tough, and pinched up it will immediately fall 
again. 

As for old or new killed, try the Legs, Hands, and 
Springs, by putting your Fingers under the Bone that 
comes out ; ror if it be tainted, you will there find it by 
fmelling your Finger ; befides, the Skin will be fweaty and 
clammy when ftale, but cool and fmooth when new. 

If you find little Kernels in the Fat of Pork, like Hail- 
Shot, if many 'tis meazly, and dangerous to be eaten.

fwcfet or rank, it is new or ftale ; and the like of the Sides- 
in the moft flcfliy Parts t If tainted,^ they will look greenifh 
in ibme Places, or more than ordinary black. Look oa 
the Hoofs, and if the Clefts are very wide and tough it is

Birch Wine^ 

THE Seafon for procuring the Liquor fi-om the Birch- 
Trees, is in the Beginning of Marcb^ while the Sap 
is rifing, and before the Leaves (hoot out ; for when th^ 
Sap is become forvrard^ and the Leaves begin to appear, the 

Juice 



Ifbe'i^&oIeDvrY of a Woman. 651 

Juice by being long digefted in the Bark, grows thick and 
coloured, which was before thin and clear. 

The Method of procuring the Juice is by boiring Holes 
in the Body of the Tree, and putting in Faucets, which 
arc commonly made of the Branches of Elder, the Pith 
being taken out ; you may without hurting your Tree, if 
large, tap it in feveral Places four or five at a Time, and 
by that Means fave, from a good Store of Trees, many 
Gallons every Day. 

If you do not ufe it immediately, which is the beft Way, 
then in order to preferve it in a good Condition for Brew- 
ing, and that it may not turn four, 'till you have got the 
Quantity you want, the Bottles in which it dripped from 
the Faucets, muft be immediately well ftopp'd, the Corks 
wax'd or rofin'd. 

One Method of making it is this, to every Gallon of 
Birch Liquor, put a Quart of Honey, ftir them well toge- 
ther; put in a few Cloves, and a little Lemon Peel, 
and let it boil for near an Hour, and fcum it well con- 
tinually as it rifes, then fet it by till it is grown cool -, then 
put in two or three Spoonfuls of new Ale Ycaft to fet it a 
working, and when the Yeaft begins to fettle, put it into 
a Runlet that will juft hold it, and let it ftand fix Weeks 
or longer, if you pleafe, and then bottle it, and it will be 
fit to drink in a Month. It will keep good a Year or two : 
If you have a Mind to ufe Sugar inftead of Honey, put in 
two Pounds to a Gallon or more, if you would keep it 
long. This Wine is not only very wholefome, but plea- 
fant : It is a moft rich Cordkl, good in curing Confump- 
tions, the Pthyfick, Spleen, and alfo fiich inward Difeafes 
as accompany the Stone in the Bladder, And Dn Need-

WE take the Sap of Birch frcfti drawn, boil it as 
long as any Scum rifes ; to every Gallon of Li-

Peel ; boil it afterwards half an Hour, and fcum it very 
clean ; when it is almoft cold, fct it a working with Ycafl: 
Ipread on a Toaft 5 let it ftand five or fix Days in an open 
Vcflel, ftirring it often ; then take fuch a Cask as the Li-

Brimftone, and put it into the Cask and ftop in the Smoak 
'till the Match is extingui(hed« 

Frontiniac Wine imitated. 

BEFORE you put your Raifin Wine into the Veflel, 
add to it fbme of the Syrup of the White Frontiniac 
Crape, which we make in England^ tho' the Seafon is not 
favourable emough to ripen that Sort of Grape ; for in a had 
Year, when the White Frontiniac, or the Mu&adella 
Crapes are hard and unripe, and without Flavour, yet if 
you bake them they will tabe the rich Flavours vvJiich a 
*good Shane of Sun would have given them. You may 
either bake the Frontiniac Gi^pes with Sugar» or boil 
them to make a Syrup of their Juice, about a Quart of 
which Syrup will be enough to put to the Raifin Wine.

Berries : Add to every Gallon of Liquor three Pounds of 
Lisbon Sugar, and to the whole Quantity- put an Ounce and 
a half of Ginger, fliced, and three Quarters of an Ounce 
of Cloves 5 then boil this near an Hour, taking off the 
Scum as it riies,. and pour the whole to cool in an open 
Tub, and work it with Ale Yeaft fpread upon a Toaft of 
White Bread for three Days, and then tun it into a Veflcl 
that will juft hold it, adding about a Pound and a half of 
Raifins of the Sun fplit, to lye in Liquor 'till we draw it 
eff, which ihould not be *till the Wine is fine, which you; 
will find in January. This Wine is fo nuich like the

Wine Caskfi« 

THESE, in my Opinion, are cheapeft of all others 
to fomifh a Pcrfon readily with, as being many of 
them good Casks for Malt Liquors, becaufe the Sack and 
White Wine Sorts are always ieaibn'd to Hand, and will 
greatly improve Beers and Ales that are put in them : But 
beware of the Rheni(h Wine Cask for nrong Drinks ; for 
its Wood is fo tin^ired with this (harp Wine, that it will 
hardly ever be free of it^ and therefore fudi Casks are bed 
ufbd for Small Beo- : The Claret Cask wiU a great deal 
fooner be brought into a ierviceable Suite for holding Strong 
Drinks if it i& two or three Times fcalded with Grounds of 
Barrels, and afterwards ufed for Small Beer fome Time*. 
I have bought a But or Pipe for eight SbBlin^^ in LonJan 
with ibme Iron Hoop» on it, a Hog^iead for the iame^ 
and the half Hog(hejul lor five SbilliBgs, the Carriage for 
a But by the W^^on thirty Milesi is two Shillings and ^x- 
pence, and the Hog(head £ighteen«^nce : But to care a 
Claret Cask c^ its Cobur and Tafte, pitt a Pedc of Stone 
Lime into a Hqgfbead^ and ^ur upOB it three Pails <^ 
Water ; bung immediately with a Wood or Cock Bon^ 
and (hake it well about a Quarter of an Hoor^ and let k

IN all Soops, you ffiuft not put in your Thickening, 'till 
your HerDs arc very tender. 

When you bpil any Greens, firft foak them near two 
Hours in Water and Salt, or elfe boil them in Water and 
Salt in a Copper by themfelves, with a great Quantity of 
Water: Boil no Meat with them for that difcolours them. 

Ufe no Iron Pans, &c. for they are not proper j but let 
them be Copper, Brafe, or Sflvcr. 

When you fry any Fi(h, firft dip them in Yolks of 
Eggs and fry them rather in a Stew-pan over the Fire, 
ai^that will naake them of a light Gold Cok)uc. 

White Sauces are now mxxe generally ufcd than Brown, 
which is done <?hiefly with Qeam, and add a little Cham-

Parboil all'yoor Meats that vou ufe for your Fricafeys, or
