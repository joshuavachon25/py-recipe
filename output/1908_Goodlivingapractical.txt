THIRD EDITION, WITH ADDITIONAL MATERIAL 



* We may live without poetry, music, and art ; 

We may live without conscience and live without heart ; 
We may live without friends ; we may live without books ; 
But civilized man cannot live without cooks. 

* He may live without books — what is knowledge but grieving ? 
He may live without hope— what is hope but deceiving ? 

He may live without love — what is passion but pinii^ ? 
But where is the man that can live without dining ?

PREFACE TO NEW EDITION. 

In offering this new chapter (see p. 564) the author has 
deemed it unnecessary to multiply the technical details of 
the preparation of many of the dishes, the body of this work 
containing full instructions as to the foundation sauces, and 
processes of cooking. In the Index will be readily found 
answers to every question that may arise as to manner and 
method. 

In some instances, however, for very important new 
dishes, more detail is given. The space being limited, it has 
seemed to the author better to give as many new receipts as 
may be compatible with perfect clearness, always with the 
chief purpose in mind of making the receipts practical. 

Many receipts are absolutely new. Others are new to this 
work, especially the receipts for chaud-froids and the finer 
grade of jellied dishes, to which the author begs to draw 
particular attention, as they hold a very high place in the 
finest French cuisine. '' The simplified details of these prepa- 
rations are most carefully studied, with the earnest desire of 
bringing these gastronomical dainties within reach of every 
housekeeper. 

Where artichokes are called for, the author begs to say 
that " fonds d'artichauts " are now to be had in tins, and of 
an excellent quality, but urges that, in all cases where the 
receipt does not direct to cut up the artichokes, those of 
largest circumference may be selected, the small ones being 
quite useless to serve whole. 



IV PREFACE TO NEW EDITION. 

French leaf-gelatine is excellent and recommendable and 
perfectly obtainable at large grocery-shops. It requires no 
soaking, which in many cases simplifies the preparation of 
jellied dishes.

PREFACE. 

It is proposed, in this present work, to make an attempt 
to carry the simplicity and exactness of the science of cook- 
ery one step forward, and thus contribute toward bringing 
this most excellent and necessary branch of chemistry (of 
which cooking certainly forms a part) into the more imme- 
diate and practical use of our own households. It is most 
earnestly desired to help house-keepers to set forth a dainty 
table at moderate outlay, and to give them receipts so clearly 
and accurately explained that the percentage of success shall 
be materially increased — granted that the same house-keeper 
or her cook shall bring to the undertaking an average amount 
of intelligence ; for, no matter how much pains any writer or 
compiler of cookery-books may take to make receipts clear 
and practical, the same necessity exists as that recognized 
by the great painter, who, when asked how he mixed his 
colors, replied, " With brains, sir." 

There has been, within the last few years, a marked im- 
provement in the designation of the various ingredients and 
their quantities to be used in the preparation of dishes ; it 
is much less common nowadays than formerly to be told to 
" take some " of this, that, or the other, thereby leaving the 
chance of success entirely dependent upon the accident of 
guessing happily, or otherwise, at the relative proportion of 
the component parts of dishes. The noticeable improve- 
ment in this reject is already a stride taken in the right 
direction, and receives full consideration in the present work. 

It is frequently found to be a stumbling-block to the suc- 
cess of a dish that the time for the fire to do its work is not 



vi PREFACE. 

specified. This last must be recognized by all as being a most 
important factor in the case. Of course, it is often impossi- 
ble to lay down fixed rules on this subject ; but it is possible 
to give an approximate idea — to give an average of time, 
which shall be dependent only to a certain extent upon con- 
comitant circumstances, notably upon the heat of the fire ; 
this latter depending, not upon the maker of the cookery- 
book, but upon the maker of the fire. Surely, with experi- 
ence to guide, and an earnest desire to throw light upon this 
important point, we ought and must be able to improve upon 
the old-fashioned " cook until done " ; which form of phrase 
conveys to the amateur, or to the inexperienced cook, no idea 
whatsoever as to whether allowance should be made of six 
hours or six minutes for the fire to do its share in the prepa- 
ration of the dish to be served. This, therefore, is the point 
to which much study has been devoted, for decisions upon 
which the best authorities have been consulted, and unlimited 
tests made, with, it is believed, results that will be of, sub- 
stantial service to many struggling souls. 

Especial attention has been given to our conventional, 
simple, home dishes, which, as a rule, are not sufficiently 
noticed ; it being taken for granted, apparently, that, on ac- 
count of their simplicity, directions are unnecessary. This 
mistake causes the results which are witnessed daily ; the 
simpler the thing, the worse it is done. Take, for example, 
tea. How very easy it is to make, and yet how many are 
there who make it really well ? Another example : In one 
instance met with, the subject of " Roast Beef " is disposed 
of with about half a dozen lines as to the cooking, a few 
more as to the serving and remarks — leaving, practically, the 
whole success to the brain and experience, or zi«-experience, 
of the cook. Now if the cook knows, she requires no re- 
ceipt ; if, on the other hand, she is ignorant and requires a 
receipt, it should certainly be a full and clear one, from which 
she can work with the fairest chance of success ; failing to 
find this, the result, nine times out of ten, is badly roasted 
beef. For these reasons, the receipts for roasting meats. 



PREPACK. vii 

poultry, game, etc., have been most carefully studied, even in 
the smallest detail. There is a trite old saying to the effect 
that " If a thing is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well " ■, 
to nothing does it apply more correctly than to the question 
of cooking; therefore, even in the least of these receipts, 
pains have not been spared to enable the cook, be she ama- 
teur or otherwise, to turn out, no matter how simple the 
menu, dishes that shall be successful, appetizing, and com- 
plete. 

An effort has been made to save from the general fate, a 
number of good, old-fashioned receipts, which are gradually 
being elbowed out, and their place taken by elegant novel- 
ties which have, perhaps, not a fractional part of their relish 
to recommend them. But attention is called to the fact that,, 
while plain, old-fashioned dishes have their place and share in 
the present book, it is far from being devoted solely to them. 

This work is not designed for chefs de cuisine, but for that 
large class of house-keepers who have a proper appreciation 
of the value of " Good-Living " as being, obviously, conducive 
to health and domestic happiness. For young house-keepers, 
who have their experience to gain ; it is sincerely hoped that 
this present will assist them to purchase that same experience 
at the expense of far fewer failures in the way of dinners, 
far less outlay and waste of good materials, and far less use- 
less expenditure of nerve-force. Also, forthe young cook, 
who has a worthy desire to improve herself. It has, there- 
fore, been made a rule to admit no receipt which does not 
bring with it as recommendation, first of all, acceptability ; 
then simplicity of execution, and, possibly not least impor- 
tant consideration, moderate outlay — to furnish the best for 
the least cost — a good cuisine, and, at the same time, an 
economical one. To this end have been eschewed all fanci- 
fully-extravagant receipts, calling for condiments which are 
not habitually in use, or for an excessive quantity of any 
very expensive materials. As there are many books where 
receipts of this latter class may be found, it has been deemed 
unadvisable to add one to that vast collection. 



viii PREFACE. 

An earnest endeavor has been made to collect a series of 
dishes to please all palates, the gourmet's included. There 
will, therefore, be found a large number of receipts for the 
daintiest tastes, selected from many countries, to suit the 
various requirements of our cosmopolitan community. End- 
less researches have been necessary to select these receipts 
from the most approved sources, those from other countries 
being dishes for which one or other land is famous. As the 
French cuisine is recognized as being the first of all, many 
receipts are taken from that source, adapting many of its 
methods to our requirements. In the same way, Belgium, 
that land of solid good-living, second, only, in excellence to 
France, has been taxed for contribution to our work. Eng- 
land, Germany, Italy, Holland, Denmark, etc., etc., all contri- 
bute something. 

From our home cuisine are selected the best and most 
popular dishes of the Eastern States ; those again of Phila. 
delphia, that paradise of terrapin and kindred good things ; 
from Baltimore and the South, many of the excellent dishes 
so well prepared by the negro cooks ; and from further 
South still, we have the many delicious receipts furnished by 
the Creole school of cookery. 

This outline will convey a slight idea of the enormous field 
that has been gone over, and authorities consulted, among 
whom are : 

Urbain-Dubois, " Cuisine Classique." 

Audot, " Cuisinifere de la Campagne et de la Ville." 

Caudelier, " Cuisine Economique." 

Pierre Caron, " French Dishes for American Tables," 

Cardme.

Mrs. Beeton, " Modern Household Cookery."

Etc., Etc., Etc. 

There is given a " Time-Table " for meats, one for poul- 
try and game, and one for vegetables. This is believed to 
be a novelty, and one that will supply a long-felt want ; and 
should be of great assistance, as the tables have been pre- 
pared with infinite pains, research, and tests innumerable. 

There is also given a " Table of Comparative Weights 
and Measures," which will be found useful in the kitchen. 

A chapter of " Relishes for Breakfast " has been added, 
which, it is hoped, will Serve as an aid to the house-keeper 
in making out her bill-of-fare for that meal ; oftentimes 
a weariness to the spirit after the labor of planning for 
luncheon and dinner. 

The chapter of " Stray Notes," contains, as its title implies, 
notes on various household subjects, which may be of prac- 
tical service. There are directions for the " Order of Service 
of Dinner," which will be found very useful in making out 
menus. Also will be found, wherever it is deemed appro- 
priate, the French as well as the English names of dishes. 

As a rule, the receipts are based upon the requirements of 
a family of average size — that is, six to eight persons. 

Acknowledgments are tendered to those authors from 
whose works have been taken some of the following receipts ; 
as also to the many private sources which have contributed 
so generously to the collection.

GOOD-LIVING. 



SOUPS, PUREES, AND SOUPS WITHOUT MEAT. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING SOUP. 



CONSOMM&. 



8 lbs. shin of beef, 
lo quarts of water, 

3 or 4 large carrots, 

4 large onions, 
lo allspice, 

I head of celery. 



Whole shin of veal. 

Salt and pepper, 

3 leeks, 

6 cloves, 

I cup of tomatoes or a handful of sorrel. 

Bunch of parsley. 



Put the meat, water, pepper, and salt into a large-soup- 
kettle. (An old hen may be, substituted for the shin of veal.) 
Keep it where it will come slowly to a boil, i hour ; then 
draw it forward, and bring it to a good boil ; skim as the 
scum rises ; in another hour add the vegetables, etc. ; boil 
very gently, but incessantly for about lo hours, making in all 
about 12 hours of cooking. 

Too much stress cannot be laid upon the importance of 
these two great essentials to the making of good soup : 
First, never let the soup stop boiling for one instant : Never 
add water, once the soup is started. Neither, on the other 
hand, must you let the soup boil at a racking rate, or it will 
be muddy, and you will lose a great deal by evaporation. 
If the fire needs 'replenishing, have your cook feed first one

side, then the other, when the first is well ignited. These 
rules are very simple, surely, but it will be found extremely 
difficult to make the ordinary cook, of the style we have in 
America, respect or appreciate them, unless by patience and 
repetition on the part of the house-keeper. The best soup 
in the world, no matter how much good material has been 
put into it, will be rendered insipid, flat, and tasteless by the 
infraction of any of these rules. Take them to heart : call 
them the " Golden Rules " of soup-making, and you will 
have learned a secret which you can impart to your sister- 
house-keepers, with the secure sense of conferring a benefit 
upon poor soup-loving, long-suffering humanity. 

As your soup must boil a long time, I have chosen this 
opportunity for a little dissertation on soup-making, which 
will be equally well applied to many of the following receipts. 
This receipt for Consomm6, and those for Bouillon and 
Pot-au-feu are the " mother soups," so to speak, and therefore 
there cannot be too much pains on my part, nor too much 
patience on yours, to make them clearly understood, ex- 
plained, and studied. Learn to make these reliably and 
thoroughly well, and one great step has been taken toward 
the setting forth of a good dinner. 

When your soup has boiled gently for its prescribed time, 
take it off ; strain it into a large bowl and set it away until 
next day. Then remove the fat from the surface (this makes 
excellent drippings) ; pour off all the clear part into a sauce- 
pan, and boil again for i or 2 hours. Then remove it from 
the fire. This will make a stiff jelly which will keep in win- 
ter for several days in the ice-box. It will serve also to make 
a handsome Brown Sauce (Espagnole). The best way to keep 
it, is to divide it in parts, allowing a certain quantity for 
each day, then that one part is used without disturbing the 
rest. Yellow earthenware pitchers holding i to 2 quarts 
each will be found the best to put it in. Use the thick part 
of the soup with vegetables, or other pur6e. If you have 
the carcass of a raw chicken, or any raw beef-bones, they can 
be added when the soup is first put down ; but cooked meat 



GILT-EDGED BOUILLON. 3 

or bones, unless freed from every particle of fat or meat, will 
muddy the soup. 

This soup requires no artificial coloring. 

The above, sufficiently boiled down in an uncovered sauce- 
pan, will make an excellent Glaze. (See receipt for same.) 



GILT-EDGED BOUILLON. 

This receipt gives the proportions for one quart of bouillon 
sufficiently concentrated for the use of invalids. The same 
proportions may be used, but not boiled quite as long, for 
dinners, luncheons, etc., etc. For the former purpose, that is 
for illness, where the quantity administered is required to be 
as nutritious as possible, it is decidedly better not to clear it 
any more than by passing it through a fine strainer. Ex- 
perience has proved quite satisfactorily the fact that the 
process of clearing destroys a great deal, not only of the 
more delicate flavor, but also of the nutriment contained in 
the bouillon. The tyvo "Golden Rules" of soup-making 
will require repetition very often before we succeed in get- 
ting our consommds and bouillons properly made: Never 
let the soup cease boiling when once it has begun : Never 
add water after your ingredients are once put together and 
begin to boil. 

The following receipt is the result of much personal study 
and observation, with a view ±0 two things : First, success ; 
then simplicity ; once made, literally according to directions, 
it should never fail. 

3 lbs. of beef without bone or fat, 3 or 4 cloves, 

3 quarts of cold water, 6 or 8 allspice, 

I scantcupof fresh or canned tomatoes, i small teaspoon of salt, 

I small bay-leaf, i clove of garlic (this can be omitted 
I piece of red-pepper pod, about ^ for the sick), 

inch (without seeds), i level teaspoon of celery seed. 

The beef should be as freshly killed as possible, and pref.

erably of the cut known by the butchers as the " horse- 
shoe." 

Put the above ingredients into the soup-kettle, cover, and 
bring to a boil ; when boiling smartly, set aside where it will 
simmer steadily ; do not let it rack. After 2\ hours, add : 



I medium-sized carrot cut in pieces, i sprig of thyme, 

I onion cut in pieces, i bunch of parsley and celery (if you 

have not already used seed). 



Replace the cover, leaving the top at least ^ open. Boil 
again 2^ hours, making 5 hours of actual, boiling in all. 
Now taste it. If not strong enough, boil longer until satis- 
factory. No exact time nearer than the above can be given, 
as circumstances (the amount and rapidity of evaporation, 
etc., etc.) will vary. When cooked to your tciste, strain all 
the broth off through a hair-sieve into a bowl. At this stage 
it should measure a full quart (always speaking of that to be 
used for the sick) ; or about 3 pints for dinner use. Stand it 
away until next morning. Then remove every particle of 
grease from the surface. If you are satisfied not to clarify 
it, carefully pour off the upper portion ; do not shake the 
bowl or disturb the sediment. Add about 2 tablespoonfuls 
of sherry, some salt, celery-salt (if necessary), and cayenne. 
This will now measure, wine included, a scant quart. 

To clarify the Bouillon, after renrioving the fat, pour it 
into a very clean kettle, add to it the unbeaten white of i, 
egg, also the crushed shell ; stir these into the cold soup un- 
til well mixed. Set it on the fire, and from the time it breaks 
into a boil, let it cook steadily for .10 minutes (longer will re- 
duce the soup, and make it still stronger). Stand it on the 
hearth for 3 or 4 minutes to settle ; then pour it through a 
jelly-bag, made of well-shrunken flannel. Do not squeeze 
the bag, but allow it to drip to the last drop. Then add the 
above amount of sherry, with seasonings as directed. This 
soup requires no artificial coloring, its own strength and long 
boiling producing a beautiful tint. 



POT-AU-FEU. 5 

POT-AU-FEU. 

3 pounds of lean beef, 4 quarts cold water, 
Pinch of salt, 2 carrots, 

2 turnips, small, i parsnip, 

2 leeks. Bunch of celery leaves, 

Bunch of parsley, i bay-leaf, 

2 whole cloves, I clove of garlic, 

4 allspice. Small piece of red-pepper pod. 
Small piece of lemon-peel, I cup of stewed tomatoes. 

The best cut for this is from the round, lower end, called 
the " horse-shoe " piece by the butchers. It is important to 
have lean beef, and that it should be as freshly killed as may 
be. Put down the beef, water, salt, and spices. Bring gently 
to a boil. Skim well. Set back where it will keep on a 
gentle, but very steady boil. After 2 hours, when the soup 
is well skimmed, add the vegetables, and continue to boil for 
S or 6 hours. The essentials for making good, strong, tasty 
broth, are two, namely : Never let it cease boiling ; and never, 
under any circumstance, add water to your soup during the 
cooking. Observe these rules most strictly. This receipt 
will give you an excellent soup for family use. If you wish 
to have it perfectly clear, refer to the receipt for Clearing 
Soups. If you will strain off the broth when done, through 
a fine sieve, and set it away in a cool place, the next day, 
after removing the fat, you will be able to pour off carefully 
the top, leaving all the sediment to be used in thick soups ; 
in which case you can generally dispense with the clearing 
process, which, unless done by the use of raw beef (an extra 
expense), destroys the nutritious quality of your broth. 

In France, the day the Pot-au-feu is freshly made, it is 
served with small squares of dry bread put in the tureen, 
ahd the hot soup thrown over them at the moment of serv- 
ing ; the vegetables, which have been boiled in the broth, 
are handed around on a separate dish. Cabbage may be 
added to the above receipt, with great benefit to the flavor, 
but it prevents the broth from keeping very long — otherwise 
this Pot-au-feu can be set on the ice, and kept for several 



6 GOOD.UVING. 

days in winter. This broth does not require coloring if 
boiled long enough. 

In Italy, grated cheese is served with the above, each guest 
taking one teaspoonful in his soup-plate. Any cooked meat 
added to the soup-pot will make the broth less clear. 

The beef cooked in the broth becomes the French 
Bouilli (see receipt). In this case, it should weigh at least 
six pounds, cooked in the above proportions. 

COLORING FOR SOUPS. 

An excellent preparation which can be kept on hand for 
coloring soups, is the following : 

Take an earthen jar ; fill it to the top, first with a layer of 
onions, one whole clove stuck in each, then a layer of soft 
sugar, a small piece of butter, and so on until the jar is filled. 
Put this into the oven overnight, when the fire is allowed to go 
out. Repeat this every night until the onions have cooked 
down, and a dark syrup is formed. Two nights may be suf- 
ficient, according to the fire. Put your jar aside, and use a 
few drops at a time to color soups, gravies, etc. There are 
few simpler or more satisfactory receipts than this ; but the 
best color for soups is that produced by good materials and 
long boiling. 

CLEARING SOUPS. 

Never use whites of eggs for the purpose, unless as a mat- 
ter of economy and convenience, as this process injures the 
delicacy of the flavor. But if preferred, do so in the follow- 
ing manner : Stir into the cold soup, i or more whites of 
eggs, according to the quantity to be clarified ; crush the 
shells and add to the soup. Bring to a boil ; then boil 
rapidly for lo minutes. Stand the kettle on the hearth for 
lo minutes, then strain through a flannel bag. The white of 
I egg will suffice for about 3 pints of broth. 

The following is recommended as being the better method : 



AMBER CONSOMM&. 7 

To 2 quarts of stock, allow f of a pound of lean beef, chopped 
fine. Put it into a stewpan with the stock and some of its 
vegetables. Stir until it begins to boil. Draw to side of the 
range and simmer gently for 30 minutes. Then strain twice 
through a fine cloth. If clear soups are much used in your 
household, one or two bags made of flannel, which has been 
washed frequently until well shrunken, will be found very 
useful. Attach a tape to each side of the bag, and suspend 
it by them to two chairs. Place a bowl under to catch the 
soup. This will save much trouble, and make your stock of 
the clearest. (See Gilt-edged Bouillon.)

into an earthen bowl, and set away overnight. Next day 
remove the fat from the top ; take out the jelly, leaving the 
thickest part of the sediment (which will do to put into a 
thick soup) ; mix in the shells and whites of eggs. Boil 
quickly for 10 minutes ; then place the kettle on the hearth 
for 10 minutes to settle. Pour the soup through the jelly. 
bag. It should come out perfectly clear, of a very pretty 
golden brown color. Do not squeeze the bag. If the soup is 
not clear, pass it through again until clear. Use the brightest

use it, or the particles will wash off again into the soup. 
Serve for dinner-parties, luncheons, etc. Garnish to taste. 
Do not use any artificial coloring.

BROTH MADE IN ONE HOUR. 

BOUILLON FAIT EN UNE HEURE. 

I lb. of beef, Small piece of fat pork, chopped, 

I carrot, cut fine, 2 ^lls of cold water, 

I onion, " " i pint of boiling water. 

Put all except the boiling water into a stewpan. Stew 
15 minutes, until it begins to cling to the sides. Then add 
the boiling water. Boil 45 minutes. Strain, squeezing the 
meat well. Season with pepper, salt, and celery-salt. Serve. 

ANOTHER HASTY BROTH 

Is made by cutting vegetables fine, frying in butter, add- 
ing boiling water enough for the soup ; salt and pepper, and 
enough of Liebig's Extract to give color and strength. 
When one is disappointed by the butcher, this is a resource 
not to be despised.

into a small tin or earthen dish i or 2 inches deep, with 
straight sides ; place this in a second dish in which there is a 
little boiling water, and bake in so moderate an oven that it 
will neither bubble nor brown. Remove it from the oven 
just as soon as it becomes firm. Let it get perfectly cold, 
then cut it in ^inch slices, and these again into fancy 
shapes with a vegetable cutter. Lay them in the tureen and 
pour the clear, hot Consomm^ very gently over them. Allow 
2 gills of Consomm6, or Gilt-edged Bouillon (see receipts)

Boil the macaroni, broken in 2-inch lengths, in salted 
boiling water until almost tender — that is 10 or 15 min- 
utes ; drain very thoroughly and drop into boiling broth 16 
minutes before serving. It must be very tender, but not 
break. Serve with Parmesan cheese, grated. 

TAPIOCA SOUP. 
POTAGE AU TAPIOCA. 
4 oz. of tapioca, 3 pints of Broth.

CONSOMM& WITH POACHED EGGS. 

CONSOMM^ AUX CEUFS POCH^S. 
6 eggs, 3 pints of Consomme, or Gilt-edged Bouillon. 

Drop the eggs, one by one, into boiling salted water. A 
frying-pan is best for the purpose. One tablespoonful of 
vinegar may be added to the water. When the eggs are firm, 
carefully remove with a spoon or perforated skimmer ; lay in 
cold water for a moment while you trim the edges evenly ; 
transfer to the tureen ; pour the boiling soup very gently into 
the tureen and serve. The allowance is i egg and 2 gills 
of consomm^ per person, . 

N.B. — Do not allow the water to boil when once the eggs 
are in it, but draw the pan to one side of the range and 
cook rather slowly until firm. The jumping of the boiling 
water makes the edges of the eggs ragged.

FOR THE BALLS. 

Brains of the head, i onion, chopped, 

t tablespoon of parsley, chopped, Cracker-dust. 

Put the head (well-cleaned, as directed in receipt for Mock- 
Turtle Soup No. I.) and knuckle of veal into a large soup- 
kettle f full of cold water. Reserve the brains to prepare 
later. Add to the soup-kettle the onions and simmer gently 
until the veal-knuckle is perfectly cooked and tender, but not 
in pieces. Remove this from the pot and set aside to use 
(see Browned Knuckle of Veal). Let the calf's head con- 
tinue to boil until the meat begins to fall from the bones ; 
then take it out. Remove all the bones and the eyes. 
Skin the tongue ; cut it and all the meat into small pieces. 
Season with salt, pepper, and the spices. Strain the soup ; 
return to the fire and thicken with flour that has been 
browned over the fire with a little butter, allowing about 2 
tablespoonfuls of flour to i quart of soup. Stir and boil 
up. Add the meat ; bring it to a boil, then pour all into a 
bowl and set away until next day. 

To make the balls, parboil the brains, chop the onion and 
parsley, and stir all together with a knife. Then make them 
up into small balls, with just enough of the same browned 
flour to make them sufficiently solid to fry. Dip them in

required. 

Next day, skim the fat from the top of the soup, put it on 
the fire and bring it to a boil. Put the balls into the tureen, 
pour the boiling soup gently over them and serve. Each 
guest adds lemon-juice and sherry to his taste, for which 
purpose, cut the lemon into small sections and hand it with 
the soup. This is an old-fashioned Philadelphia receipt and

clean. Scrape out and wash very carefully the ears. Then 
rinse again in cold water. The head must be perfectly sweet 
and clean before putting it down to cook. Put it in a kettle 
with the cold water; put the kettle over a moderate fire. 
When it comes to a good boil, skim. After 15 minutes, 
skim again. Let it simmer, not boil hard, until thp meat is 
quite tender, which will be in about 2 hours. Remove 
the head ; take the meat from the bones, skin the tongue 
and set away to cool. Return the bones to the kettle with 
the vegetables, cleaned and sliced, also the spices, liver, and 
herbs. Simmer gently again for 2 hours. Strain and set 
away overnight. Set aside the liver and heart to cool with 
the other meat. Next day remove the fat from the soup.

boiled, until the flesh leaves the bones easily (about 3 hours), 
take out the best parts and press them between 2 dishes 
until cold. Remove the bones from the soup-kettle, leaving 
the coarser parts of the meat. Simmer for 3 hours. Strain ; 
when cold, skim thoroughly. 

Next day, cut the pressed meat into dice, and prepare Egg- 
balls {as per receipt) as garnish for the soup. Flavor the

CHICKEN GUMBO FIL£. 
GOMBO fil:^. 

1 large fowl, 4 quarts of boiling water,

2 oz. of chopped onion, 25 oysters, 
>^ pint of " okra. Flour, 

Cayenne and salt, X ^- °^ ^^^ cut in dice. 

}4 teaspoon of file powder. 

N. B. — The " fil6 powder" made of sassafras -buds is 



22 GOOD-LIVING. 

very generally used in New Orleans, and is obtainable, it is 
said, at herb shops or of first-class grocers. 

Clean and cut the fowl in pieces ; season with pepper and 
salt ; dredge with flour ; put it into the kettle with the butter, 
lard, and onion ; fry until quite brown, then add the water. 
Cover the pot and allow it to simmer, not boili, for 2 hours. 
Add the oysters and okra, and simmer gently 30 minutes 
longer. Just before serving, add the fil^ powder and 
cayenne. N. B. — Do not attempt to add the sassafras 
while the soup is on the fire ; the result of so doing would be 
to precipitate the powder to the bottom of the pot. Serve. 

OKRA GUMBO. 
GOMBO F^VI. 

8 large, solid tomatoes, skinned and % cup of rice, well-washed, 

cut up, X ^- chopped ham (may be omitted 

50 okras, stemmed and cut in y^ inch for maigre soup), 

pieces. Pepper to taste (4 drops of Tabasco 

2 large red onions, chopped (if white preferred), 

use 3), I tablespoon of butter, 

)i, sweet-pepper, chopped, Salt, 

I cup of broth or boiling water. 

Stew the onion for a few minutes in the butter. Do not 
brown it. Add the above ingredients and stew very gently, 
stirring frequently to prevent the rice scorching. After 20 
to 30 minutes, add a cup of broth or boiling water. (A great 
improvement, upon this, is to use the liquor of tomatoes 
which have already been stewed. This imparts a richness of 
flavor superior to either the broth or water.) Stew from 4 to 
6 hours, very gently. Caution : Do not leave it on too hot 
a fire or it will scorch ; stir frequently to prevent same. 
The soup will be very thick ; should you prefer it thinner, 
add more broth or tomato-juice as above. This dish is much 
better the second day, as indeed are most dishes into the 
composition of which there enter a variety of ingredients. 
Re-heat it in a china-lined saucepan, if necessary, and serve.

OF PUREES IN GENERAL. 

As this term is used in three senses, it is necessary to de- 
fine what is meant by each. All purees are made by boiling 
or stewing vegetables in broth or water, passing the mixture, 
when cooked, through a sieve. 

If it is to be used as a vegetable, it should be almost solid, 
as, for instance, pur6e of potatoes, which is nothing more nor 
less than soft mashed potatoes. 

If it is to be used as soup, the pulp, prepared as above, is 
diluted with stock, milk, or water to the consistency of thick 
cream, as pease soup. 

If it is to be used as sauce, the consistency varies with the 
material employed, but may be described, as a rule, as being 
thinner than the vegetable and thicker than the soup, as 
tomato sauce. Taste and experience must regulate this. 

Soup purees do not keep, usually, more than twelve hours 
in moderately-warm weather, and not much longer in winter.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR FRYING. 

Particular attention is called to the fact that every thing 
depends upon the manner in which an article of food is fried, 
as to whether it is most unwholesome or comparatively in- 
nocuous. There is no process of cooking which can be made 
to render food more indigestible than this same process of 
frying ; therefore it is of paramount importance that it should 
be most carefully studied and well understood. The sense of 
the matter is this : If an article to be fried is put into luke- 
warm or even quite hot fat, whether lard, drippings, or but- 
ter, the same article warms with it, drawing in at .every pore 
the greasy fluid ; whereas, if, on the contrary, the fat is 
heated to boiling-point, that point being much higher for 
fatty fluid than for water, the moment the article to be fried 
is plunged into it, the intense heat closes every pore, and, it 
being instantly seared, cannot absorb an atom of the fat ; 
when removed from the .grease and drained of all moisture 
that may remain on the surface (which may be accomplished 
by placing the article upon absorbent paper) there is really 
no grease remaining to tax the digestive powers. A well- 
fried croquette, for instance, should not leave a trace of 
grease upon the cut paper or folded napkin upon which it 
is served ; a well-fried Saratoga-chip may be taken up 
by gloved fingers, and not a trace of grease appear on 
the glove. The secret of all, then, is to have the lard or 
drippings sufficiently deep in the pan to serve for whatever 
frying may be necessary at the one time ; not to be obliged 
to add (Hibernian fashion) a great lump of cold lard, 

40 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR FRYING. 41 

" because there is n't enough to fry all " you may happen 
to have. This checks the boiling of the lard and immedi- 
ately the article immersed in it absorbs the fat again. 
Have plenty of lard and have it boiling. These are the two 
rules most necessary to observe. Do not be misled by hear- 
ing the lard spit and crackle ; that is no evidence of boiling ; 
it is simply throwing off some little drop of moisture. It 
must heat slowly at first, and then, being drawn forward on 
the range, be brought to a boil. When lard boils, it is per- 
fectly still, until it begins to smoke ; at this point there is 
danger of burning, so that it should not be allowed to smoke 
long, but be pushed aside a little for a moment or two. To 
test it when boiling, drop in one drop of water which should 
make a slight explosion ; or drop in a bit of the soft part of 
bread. If the lard is ready, the bread will begin to color al- 
most instantly. When the article is fried, skim it out, drain- 
ing off all fat ; lay it upon a sheet of brown paper in the 
open mouth of the oven, or upon the corner of the range, 
where it will keep very hot while drying ; should it be chilled, 
the fat will harden upon it instead of draining off. Pure 
lard is recommended for frying croquettes, etc. ; butter 
should seldom be used, except for saut^ing, as it burns 
and blackens. 



FISH. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

TO BOIL FISH NO. L 

Wash the fish thoroughly inside and out. Wipe dry with 
a clean cloth. Trim the fins close to the body with scissors. 
Have in a kettle on the fire enough water to cover the fish 
entirely. It should be well salted — that is, from 4 to" 8 oz. 
of salt and \ oz. of saltpetre to every gallon of water. The 
water must boil when the fish is put in. It is almost impos- 
sible to boil fish handsomely without a regulation fish-kettle, 
with its drainer inside. When the fish is cleaned and the 
water boiling, lay the fish on the drainer and set the drainer 
in the kettle. Allow about 8 minutes to the pound for a large, 
thick fish, and 5 minutes to the pound for small, thin fish, 
counting from the time when the water begins again to 
boil after the fish is put in. It should boil very gently, in 
order not to crack the skin. You can tell when it is done by 
the flesh parting very easily from the bone. A little vinegar 
is a good addition to the water. When done lift out the 
drainer, set it across the kettle, and drain the fish dry. Serve 
on a folded napkin, garnished with parsley and sliced lemon< 
Always serve also an appropriate sauce. 

TO BOIL FISH NO. IL 

There come times and seasons when it is difificult to 
vary one's supply of fish, and the only resource from 
monotony is to vary the mode of cooking the fish at om? 

42 



FISH BOILED AU COURT BOUILLON. 43 

command. It is therefore suggested, if you have only a 
common, rather tasteless fish to offer, to boil it in the 
following manner : 

Put down the fish-kettle with boiling water sufficiently 
deep to cover the fish to be cooked. In this put 2 or 3 
onions, i bay- leaf, sprig of thyme, 6 or 8 cloves, twice as 
many allspice, lemon-peel, salt, a bit of red pepper-pod, and 
lastly, when the water has boiled long enough to extract the 
flavor of the various condiments, add about i tablespoonful 
of vinegar. In this place the strainer containing the fish neat- 
ly dressed (see To Boil Fish No. I.). Boil according to the 
size of the fish, allowing from 5 to 8 minutes per pound. 
It is easily ascertained when it is done by the flesh parting 
readily from the bone. Remove the strainer ; drain ; dish 
the fish on a folded napkin ; dress with sliced lempn and 
plenty of parsley, to avoid drawing too close attention to 
the kind of fish it is. Serve with a Tartare Sauce or with a 
Cucumber Sauce (see receipts), and you will find your dish 
as highly relished as though you offered your guest a rare 
and fine fish.

to keep it white. Put it into the boiling fish-broth, 
which must cover it well. Simmer very gently, allowing 
5 to 10 minutes per pound. When cooked, drain dry, 
and serve on a folded napkin with parsley and lemon and 
a sauce. ' 



44 GOOD-LIVING. 

TO BOIL. A TROUT OF ONE POUND. 

When properly scaled and dressed and washed inside and 
out, wrap it in a napkin ; drop it into well-salted boiling 
water. Boil only 4 or 5 minutes. Drain well and serve on 
a foldfed napkin, with parsley and lemon and Maitre d'H6tel 
Sauce (see receipt). 

TO STEAM A FISH. 

Having washed and dressed the fish, secure the tail in its 
mouth ; lay it on a plate and pour over it ^ pint of vinegar, 
pepper and salt. Let it stand one hour in the ice-box ; then 
pour off the vinegar ; put it in a steamer over boiling water ; 
cover tightly and steam 20 minutes for a medium-sized fish. 
When done, the flesh will part easily from the bone. Drain 
it well and serve as above with Maitre d'Hdtel Sauce (see 
receipt). 

TO BROIL FISH. 

When it is very hot, grease the gridiron thoroughly. 
Clean and split the fish (unless small) and lay it upon the grid- 
iron. If the fish is small, broil over a quick, clear fire ; for a 
large fish, the fire should be more moderate, or the outside 
will be charred before the inside is cooked. Turn constant- 
ly, keeping the skin side longest against the fire. When 
done through (when the flesh will part easily from the bone), 
loosen the fish with a knife from the broiler ; turn the hot 
dish over the fish, and with a quick movement turn the two 
back again dexterously. A broken fish is most unappetizing, 
therefore it must be very carefully dished. Butter it gener- 
ously ; add salt and pepper, and, generally, a tablespoonful 
of chopped parsley and juice of ^ a lemon. 

TO FRY FISH. 

Cut the fins off ; wash the fish and dry it inside and out. 
If a thick fish, cut three gashes diagonally across the back ; 
if small, leave it whole. To dry it thoroughly, powder it 



STEWED FISH EN MATELOTE. 45 

over with flour. Then dip it in egg, and then in fine sifted 
bread-crumbs, cracker-dust, or corn-meal, as you may prefer. 
Have the lard heating meanwhile, and when fiercely hot, lay 
in the fish. In 3 or 4 minutes (for a medium-sized fish) turn 
it over carefully with the cake-turner. The moment it is 
thoroughly done (when the flesh leaves the bone readily) re- 
move it from the pan to a piece of clean brown paper. Then 
serve it on a folded napkin. Nothing so spoils fried fish (or, 
indeed, any thing fried) as to let it stand in the pan a moment 
after it is sufficiently cooked. 

Follow the above rules carefully, and you will not find 
fried fish the dyspeptic bugbear it is credited with being. 
(See General Directions for Frying.) 

TO FRY BROOK TROUT OR OTHER SMALL FISH. 

Clean and wash the fish, and let them lie a few minutes 
wrapped separately in a clean, dry towel ; they must be 
perfectly dry inside as well as outside ; season with salt and 
pepper and roll in corn-meal. Fry them in a mixture of 
\ butter and \ lard. Drain on a sieve or coarse brown 
paper, and serve hot or, a folded napkin. Be sure the lard is 
boiling. (See General Directions for Frying.) 

STEWED FISH EN MA TELOTE. 

MATELOTE DE POISSON. 

3 or 4 lbs. of any firm fish, I cup of boiling water, 

2 or 3 onions, sliced, I cup of claret or white wine. 

Pepper and salt, i teaspoon of butter. 

Pinch of ground cloves, mace, and allspice, 2 teaspoons of ilour. 

Cut the fish across in steaks, about one inch thick. Set 
aside until wanted. Meanwhile, boil the onions in very little 
water until perfectly tender. When cooked, drain off the 
water and add pepper, salt, spices,' the boiling water, and 
wine. Lay in the slices of fish. When it comes to a boil, 
add in the flour and butter rubbed together and blended 



46 GOOD-LIVING. 

first with a little of the sauce. Stir. The fish will require 
about 10 minutes to boil. When thoroughly cooked, dish 
the steaks in a circle ; strain the sauce over them and serve 
garnished with large Croutons of stale bread, cut either in 
cubes or diamonds (see receipt). 



FISH STUFFED AND BAKED. 



4 or 5 lbs. fish, whole, 


Butter, 


2 cups of boiling water, 


I cup claret. 


2 or 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, 


Flour, 


Yz lemon, 


Dressing, 


Salt, 


Pepper. 



Trim the fins of the fish and wipe clean and dry, inside 
and out. Fill the fish with dressing, and sew it up with 
coarse thread. For the dressing, take dried bread-crumbs 
enough to fill the fish ; put a large lump of butter into the 
frypan ; let it melt, but not cook ; lay the bread-crumbs in, 
stirring around only long enough for the crumbs to absorb 
the butter. To this add \ an onion chopped very fine and 
fried also in butter, i tablespoonful of chopped parsley and a 
little lemon-juice, a pinch of cayenne and salt. When the 
fish is sewn up, lay it in a roasting-pan just long enough to 
fit it ; put bits of butter all over the top and the boiling 
water in the pan. S.eason it. Bake for about 20 minutes, 
basting frequently; then add the wine, Worcestershire 
sauce, lemon-juice, and bake until done, basting frequently. 
This will take about 45 minutes in all, but will depend upon 
the size and thickness of the fish. When the fish is done 
(the flesh leaving the bone easily), remove it to a hot dish' 
and garnish with parsley and lemon. Put the pan on top of 
the range. Add a little more water if necessary, and i gill 
of claret. When boiling, stir in about i teaspoonful of 
butter and 2 of flour, rubbed smooth and blended with some 
of the sauce. Boil up for 2 minutes ; strain over the fish, 
and serve. 



SASS STEWED WITH TOMATOES. 47 

FISH SALAD. 

6 lbs. striped bass, cut in steaks, i onion, 

Bones of the same. Butter, 

6 yolks of eggs, beaten together, Salt, 

3 whites of eggs, " " Cayenne, 

Juice of 3 lemons. 

Cut the fish into steaks, reserving all the bones, which you 
put down in i quart of boiling water with the onion fried 
slightly in butter, pepper, and salt. In this boil the fish 
steaks, which remove, when firm, to a platter. Strain the 
liquor in which the fish-bones, etc., have boiled ; squeeze 
into it the lemon-juice ; add a little cayenne to taste, and 
then very carefully add the beaten eggs. The safest way to 
do this successfully, is to remove the boiling liquid from the 
fire ; let it stand a moment ; have a little cold water mixed 
with your eggs, and pour these gently into the hot liquid, 
stirring briskly all the time. Return to the fire until it 
thickens, but without boiling, stirring constantly. Pour this 
over the fish and set away to cool. Dress with neatly cut 
strips of beet or red-pepper, and trim the edge with small 
lettuce leaves. Excellent.

Stew the tomatoes (peeled) for 30 minutes. Cut the fish 
(any firm, white-fleshed fish will do) into square pieces, 



48 GOOD-LIVING. 

removing all the bones. Fry the sliced onions in the sweet 
oil. Lay the fish cutlets in the saucepan with the onions 
and sweet oil ; strain the tomatoes over this ; season with 
salt and pepper. Cover closely and stew gently for i hour. 
It must cook slowly, or the fish will go to pieces. Dish the 
cutlets neatly in a circle and pour the tomatoes, slightly 
thickened with corn-starch, over them. Serve. 



WHITEBAIT. 

Whitebait must be perfectly fresh, and must be kept 
in iced or salted water until required. 

When you are ready to cook them, drain them off and 
throw upon a clean, dry cloth. Pat very gently with the 
cloth to absorb whatever water may remain. Have a second 
cloth ready with about 2 good handfuls of flour for i pound 
of whitebait. Put the whitebait into this and toss them 
from side to side until every little fish has its separate and 
individual covering of flour. Then turn them upon a coarse 
sieve for the extra flour to sift out. Meanwhile, haye on 
the fire a saucepan with lard 2 inches deep. Bring to a boil, 
and test with a bit of bread to see if it is just right before 
you put in the fish. Now put about \ of the pound at 
a time into a frying-basket, so that they shall not be too 
crowded. Lay the frying-basket in the lard until the 
little fish curl — that is, about 2 minutes. Turn them out 
upon a clean piece of brown paper in a hot place while you 
fry the rest. Sprinkle pepper and salt over all as evenly as 
you can. Have a napkin folded and baked in the oven until 
very hot. When the fish are cooked and the fat thoroughly 
drained off, lay them ihside of the hot napkin. They should 
be eaten immediately. If kept standing, will become tough 
or limp. Serve, at the same time, cayenne and a lemon cut 
in quarters ; also small tartines made of the best brown 
bread, cut as thin as a wafer and buttered with the freshest 
of butter.

Make a light and delicate dressing as indicated in the 
receipt for Fish Stuffed and Baked. 'Stuff the shad ; sew it 
up ; have a large sheet of white paper buttered. Fold up the 
fish in it, twisting the ends securely to keep in both butter 
and steam. Put in a baking-pan and set in the oven. It will 
not require basting and will be done in about 45 minutes if 
of medium sizei Remove the paper and serve with a Maitre 
d'H6tel or other fish-sauce. N. B. — The oven should be 
moderate.

neatly (see Directions for Boiling Fish), lay it on the strainer, 
and place it in the boiling water. Be careful, in dishing, not 
to break the skin. Dish on a folded napkin and garnish with 
parsley and sliced lemon. It will take about 20 to 25 minutes 
to cook. Serve with this a Maitre d' Hotel Sauce (see receipt), 
or a Sauce Hollandaise. If a roe-shad, the roe should be 
dipped in flour after having been parboiled (about 10 min- 
utes) ; it is then fried in butter until firm and golden brown.

ALOSE FARCIE II, 

Leave the head on and do not split the fish. Make a 
force-meat of grated bread-crumbs, cold ham or bacon 
minced fine, sweet marjoram, pepper, salt, mace or pinch 
of ground cloves. Moisten with a raw egg. Having dressed, 
washed, and dried the fish, stuff the inside with this, reserving 
a little to rub over the outside, having first rubbed the fish 
with yolk of raw egg. Place the fish in a deep pan, securing 
its tail in its mouth. Pour into the bottom of the pan a little 
water ; add a gill of port wine or claret and a piece of butter 
rolled in flour. Baste. Bake it well (45 minutes), and send 
it to table with the gravy poured over it. Garnish with 
lemon. Any fish may be baked in the same manner. A 
large fish of 10 or 12 lbs. weight will require two hours' bak- 
ing. (The average market shad weighs about 4 lbs.) The 
time first indicated is for a fish of moderate size.

PLANKED SHAD. 

A thick oak board is prepared for this purpose with wooden 
pegs. Spread the fish open on the board and secure it with 
the pegs. Place the board before a clear fire, the end resting 
in a shallow pan, in which there is a little salt and water 
to baste the toasting fish. When almost cooked, baste also 
with melted butter and a little walnut catsup. Serve on the 
board (if a handsome one), or, when dishing, add a little wal- 
nut catsup to the gravy and pour it over the fish. Serve 
with pickled walnuts. 



i SHAD-ROE CROQUETTES. 5 1 

PICKLED OR SOUSED SHAD. 

Put the fish-kettle on the fire- with plenty of water to cover 
your fish. When boiling, throw in i cupful of salt. Lay the 
fish on the drainer in the kettle and boil about 30 minutes 
(according to the size of the fish). Take out the fish, drain 
it very thoroughly and let it get cold. Meanwhile take 
some of the water in which the fish was boiled ; add to it 
whole cloves, whole allspice, whole mace, and a piece of red 
pepper-pod without the seeds. Boil until the water is 
strongly flavored with the spices. Cut the fish in large 
pieces ; lay these in a stone crock ; mix from J to J strong 
vinegar with the spiced liquor, and pour over the fish until it 
is quite covered. Lay a cloth over the mouth of the jar ; put 
the cover on and set it away. It will be ready for use in one 
or two days, and will keep in a cold place for a fortnight, 
if the fish is always well covered by the liquor. 

Many other kinds of fish, such as bluefish, rockfish, etc., 
etc., are excellent treated in the same manner. This makes 
an excellent relish for luncheon.

SAUMON, SAUCE MAYONNAISL. 
To every 3 pounds of salmon put : 

z lb. salt, I gal. water, 

)i oz. of saltpetre. 

Let the salt and water be thoroughly boiling, and skim it 
before you put in the fish. Boil quickly, allowing about 10 
minutes to the pound, whole ; serve immediately. Or if sliced, 
should be cut i inch thick. 

The appropriate sauces are mayonnaise, tartare, or a little 
of the water in which the salmon was boiled, with chopped 
parsley and lemon-juice added. - 

SALMON STEAKS (ENGLISH RECEIPT). 

Cut the fish in slices about i inch thick. Dry well with a 
cloth ; dredge with flour, and lay them on a well-buttered 
gridiron over clear, hot coals. Turn with a broad-bladed 
knife slipped beneath, and a flat wire egg-beater above, lest 
the steak should break. When done to a light brown, lay in 
a hot dish ; butter each steak, seasoning with salt and pep- 
per ; cover closely, and serve with chopped parsley. 

SALMON CROQUETTES. 

CROQUETTES DE SAUMON.

in the ice-box for at least i hour ; then fry in boiling lard. 
See General Directions for Frying. Drain dry and serve 
on a cut paper or folded napkin garnished with parsley. 

BOILED COD. 

CABILLAUD. 

In boiling cod, a smaller quantity of salt is used than for 
salmon ; i ounce of salt to i quart of water is the propor- 
tion. Place the cod on the fish-drainer in the kettle, and 
cover with cold water salted as above. Let it come almost 
to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes ; skim. The time of 
boiling must vary with the weight, moreover with the thick- 
ness of the fish. It may take from 20 minutes for a small 
cod to 30 for a medium-sized one. The large ones are best 
cooked in sections, or they will not boil evenly, the thickness 
varying so much. Drain and serve on a napkin with Oyster 
or Egg Sauce (see receipts). 

COD STEAKS. 
FILETS DE CABILLAUD. 

Should either be dipped in egg and flour; and fried in boiling 
lard ; or wrapped in buttered paper and baked in the oven. 
for 30 minutes ; or powdered with bread-crumbs and broiled. 

The proper sauces to serve with cod in any style are : Oy- 
ster Sauce, Egg Sauce, Brown Caper Sauce, or Anchovy 
Sauce ; Oyster Sauce is of course preferred (see receipts).

and cream ; mix thoroughly, and mould into round or oval 
balls. Roll these in the beaten egg, then in the bread-crumbs, 
which must be very fine ; then lay them on a frying-basket and 
sink in deep boiling lard, having tested the heat with a bit 
of bread. See General Directions for Frying. When the 
croquettes are a fine golden-brown, lift out the basket, let it 
drain for a moment, and serve the croquettes on a folded 
napkin. This quantity will make i8 good-sized croquettes.

FRIED SOLE (ENGLISH RECEIPT), 

SOLES FRITES. 

The fish must be perfectly fresh, and perfectly clean. If 
the former point is in the slightest degree doubtful, do not 
attempt to fry it whole, but remove the fillets from the bone 
and cut off the parts near the head and at the edges, and 
wash with vinegar and water. After the sole has been 
cleaned, it must be thoroughly dried, and lightly dredged 
with flour, which completes the drying. Have ready plenty 
of sifted bread-crumbs, and enough well-beaten yolk of egg 
to coat the fish all over ; this is best done with a brush. 
Then let every part be covered with bread-crumbs. Have the 
lard quite boiling, or the fish will be limp. See General 
Directions for Frying. Fry the fish a golden brown ; 
place it when fried on a paper before the fire to drain off the 
grease. Serve on a napkin with parsley and lemon. 

FILLETS OF SOLE A LA ORLY. 

FILETS DE SOLE A LA ORLY. 

I sole for every 4 fillets, Chopped parsley. 

Lemon-juice, pepper, and salt, i onion, sliced. 

Get your fishmonger to prepare the fillets if possible ; if 
you are obliged, however, to do them yourself, first skin the 
fish (a troublesome task if you would not waste your fish) ; 
then make a slit with a very sharp knife from head to tail on 
each side, also down the back and belly. Then run your 
sharp knife very close to the backbone each side, which will 
separate the fillets. Trim them neatly at the head and tail 
ends, and remove all the fin-bones from the sides. The fil- 
lets thus prepared and wiped clean, steep them for i hour in 
a mixture of lemon-juice, parsley, onions, salt, and pepper. 
Then drain and dry them. Cover with a coating of flour, or 
dip in Batter (see receipt) and fry in boiling lard. See Gen- 
eral Directions for Frying. Dish on a folded napkin in a 
circle, with a bunch of fried parsley in the centre. Serve with 



FILLETS OF SOLE, MAITRE D' HOTEL. 63 

Tomato Sauce (see receipt). Many other fish of delicate 
quality may be treated in the same manner. 

SOLE A LA URORE. 

I sole, Butter, salt, and pepper, 

Chopped parsley, yi, small onion, grated, 

I cup of White Sauce, 4 hard-boiled eggs. 

Butter a shallow fire-proof or tin dish ; lay the fish upon it 
whole. Cover with a buttered paper and place in the oven 
for 10 minutes. Then take it out and carefully remove the 
backbone, filling its place with chopped onions and parsley. 
Replace the upper side of the fish, and cover the whole with 
rich White Sauce (see receipt). Return to the oven for 10 to 
1 5 minutes longer. Prepare the eggs by cutting the whites 
in quarters with which to garnish the edge ; press the yokes 
through a coarse sieve. When the fish is cooked, sprinkle 
the top thickly with the yolks and returi;i to the oven for 2 
minutes, to heat thoroughly. The edges of the dish should 
be decorated with the whites of eggs, sliced lemon, and 
parsley. 

FILLETS OF SOLE, MATtRE D'H6tEL. 

FILETS DE SOLE A LA MAITRE D'h6tEL. 

1 sole makes 4 fillets, Lemon-juice, 

I oz. of butter, Parsley, 

yi g'U of cream, ^ oz. of flour. 

Time required, about 30 minutes. Fillet the sole as de- 
scribed in Fillets of Sole k la Orly. Put the bones and 
fins of the sole into a saucepan with 2 gills of hot water 
to boil. Butter a flat tin pan thoroughly. Fold the fillets 
loosely over and lay them on the tin. Sprinkle a little salt 
and a squeeze of lemon-juice over them and cover with 
a buttered paper. Set them in a sharp oven for 6 minutes. 

To make the sauce : Chop a small bunch of parsley very 
fine and put it aside. Mix in a stewpan i oz. of butter and 
J oz. of flour until smooth. Strain the fish-stock by degrees 



64 GOOD-LIVING. 

into the flour and butter, stirring quickly to prevent lumps. 
This should be done off the fire. Now put the stewpan on 
the fire and stir with a wooden spoon. Add the cream and 
stir until it boils. Remove from the fire ; add the chopped 
parsley, half a teaspoonful of lemon-juice, salt, and pepper. 
Arrange the fillets, when. done, on a hot platter ; add to the 
sauce whatever liquor may remain in the flat tin pan ; pour 
the sauce over the soles and serve. 

TO FRESHEN SALT FISH. 

"Lay the fish in cold water, carefully turning the skin-side 
upward, otherwise the salt in melting will all settle in the 
skin, and the fish be as salt as ever. 

Put the flesh side down, and naturally the salt falls to the 
bottom of the water. 

HERRING BALLS. 

3 bloaters, or red herrings. Cream, and butter, 

Equal bulk of mashed potatoes, ^gg^> 

Lard, Bread-crumbs for dipping. 

Partly boil the bloaters or herrings ; remove the skin ; 
take all the meat from the bones ; add to this the mashed 
potatoes made from potatoes baked in their skins. Add a 
large lump of butter and cream enough to soften it. Form 
ii;ito balls ; roll in egg and bread-crumbs and fry in lard 
or butter golden brown. See General DirectioAs for Fry- 
ing. Take care not to make the mixture too soft, as it will 
become still softer when subjected to the heat of the lard. 

FINNAN HADDIE. 

Cut a piece of the size required. Put it into a frying-pan 
with boiling water to cover. Boil 5 minutes. Throw off the 
water ; add a lump of butter ; when it melts, and the fish is 
well-covered with it, serve.

SHREWSBURY" COURT-BOUILLON." 

4 medium-sized or 5 small onions cut fine, ^ cup red wine, 

3^ lbs. fish (any kind that has firm ^ tablespoon of butter or sweet 

flesh will do), drippings, 

30 large clams without the beards. Small bunch of celery leaves, chopped 

1 cup stewed tomatoes, fine, 

6 large sea-biscuits, Larger bunch of parsley leaves, 

Clam-juice, chopped fine, 

yi sweet-pepper, chopped fine. Salt, pepper, 

2 potatoes, cut in pieces (not indis- Ground cloves, ground allspice, 
pensable), nutmeg or ground mace, to taste. 

Chop the onion and fry it gold color in the butter or drip- 
pings. Remove the pot (an iron one is best). Lay upon 
the onions in layers the fish, free from bones ; sweet-pepper, 
celery, and parsley chopped and sprinkled over ; then a pinch 
each of the spices, pepper, and salt ; then clams, tomatoes, 
and sea-biscuit broken in pieces ; then again the fish, etc., as 
before, until all the ingredients are in the pot. Pour in all 
the clam-juice which you have previously strained ; add cold 
water up to the level of the fish. Stew gently but 
steadily 45 minutes. Remove with a soup-strainer to a 
deep dish all that is solid, leaving the sauce in the pot. Add 
S

the red wine, and a little blending of corn-starch or flour 
rubbed up in cold water. Let the same boil 3 or 4 minutes, 
stirring frequently. Have ready the court-bouillon in a 
deep dish with a cover, (not a soup-tureen) ; strain some " of 
the sauce over it. Serve what remains in a sauce-boat. 
This will be found to be a most excellent modification of the 
common chowder, and one which is far more acceptable to a 
delicate palate. Its appearance when served is also more 
tempting. Elsewhere will be found a receipt for conven- 
tional clam chowder. 

NEW ORLEANS "COURT-BOUILLON." 

5 or 6 lbs. bass, halibut, or other fish, 3 onions, chopped, 

I tablespoon of butter, i can of tomatoes, 

I " flour, 3 or 4 whole cloves, 

I pint of claret. Pepper, salt, toast. 

Fry the onions in the biitter, then add the tomatoes snd 
cloves, etc. Let these stew together for 30 minutes. Then 
add the flour blended with about ^ a pint of the claret. Let 
it boil, stirring constantly for 5 minutes, until the flour is 
thoroughly cooked. Strain the sauce and return it to the 
fire in a saucepan. Lay in the sauce the fish cut in steaks, 
bass being best, but any firm fish will do. Let them sim- 
mer gently until cooked, which will require from 6 to 10 
minutes according to the thickness and quality of the fish. 
Have ready in a deep dish, slices of dry toast, enough to 
cover the bottom of the dish. When they are done, lay 
the slices of fish on the toast ; add the remaining \ pint of 
claret to the sauce ; pour it over the fish and serve. A piece 
of sweet-pepper chopped may be added to the above sauce, 
also cayenne and more spices, if preferred. 

FROGS FRIED IN BATTER. 
Scald the legs 3 minutes in boiling water with salt 
and a little lemon-juice ; dry in a towel ; dip in Fritter-Batter 
(see receipt), and fry in boiling lard until light golden-brown. 
Drain on soft paper and serve with a bunch of fried parsley 
on a folded napkin. Garnish with lemon.

GRENOUILLES FRITES. 

Having scalded the frogs' legs, dip them in egg and sifted 
bread-crumbs and fry as above. 

FROGS A LA POULETTE. 
GRENOUILLES A. LA POULETTE. 

Prepare the frogs' legs as above. Make a Poulette Sauce 
(see receipt) and warm the frogs' legs in it, being careful not 
to stir in the eggs until the last. If boiled after the addition 
of the eggs, the sauce will curdle. 

A WHITE FRICASSY OF FROGS. 
(old-fashioned receipt.) 

" Cut off the Hinder Legs ; strip them of the Skin and cut 

off the Feet, and boil them tender in a little Veal Broth, with 

whole Pepper and a little Salt, with a Bunch of Sweet Herbs 

and some Lemon-peel. Stew these with a Shallot till the Flesh 

is a little tender ; strain off the Liquor and thicken it with 

cream and butter ; serve them hot with Mushrooms pickled 

tossed up with the sauce. They make a very good Dish, and 

their Bones, being of a very fine Texture, are better to be 

eaten than those of Larks." 

i 

FROGS IN BROWN FRICASSY. 

" Prepare the Frogs as before, flour them well, put them 
into a pan of hot lard and fry them brown, then drain them 
from the Liquor and make a Sauce for them of good meat 
Gravy ; some Lemon-peel, a Shallot or two, some Spices 
beaten [ground], a Bunch of Sweet Herbs, an Anchovy, some 
pickled Mushrooms and their Liquor, and some Pepper and 
Salt. Toss up these thick with Butter, pour the sauce over 
them, and some Lemon-juice. Garnish with broiled Mush- 
room Flaps and Lemon sliced." 

These two antiques cannot be improved upon. 



SHELL-FISH. 

TERRAPIN. 

Terrapins are always sold alive, and are in season from 
November to March. Diamond-backs are the best, but are 
very expensive. The males are small and of inferior flavor. 
The common red-legs or fresh-water terrapins are quite good 
and much less expensive. 

PHILADELPHIA STEWED TERRAPIN. 

3 terrapins, 2 gills of thick cream, 

5 eggs, boiled hardi % lb. of butter, 

2 tablespoons of flour, 2 gills of madeira or sherry, 

I dessertspoon of salt, Cayenne to taste. 

Put the terrapins alive into a pot of boiling water and boil 
lO or 15 minutes, or until you can pull off the outer skin and 
the toe-nails. Now put them back into fresh boiling water ; 
add a heaping teaspoonful of salt, and boil slowly until the 
shells part easily and the flesh on the legs is quite tender, 
from I to \\ hours. When done, take out of the pot ; save 
2 gills of the liquor in which they are boiled. Remove the 
under shell and allow it to stand until cool enough to handle. 
Then take the meat out of the upper shells. Carefully 
remove the sand-bags, bladders, the thick, heavy part of the 
intestines, and the gall-bag which is found embedded in 
the lobe of the liver, and throw them away. In removing 
the gall-bag, be careful not to break it, as it would spoil the 
whole terrapin. In the finer preparations of terrapin the 
" ribbons " are not used. Break the terrapin into convenient- 
sized pieces, add it to the liver broken up, also all the eggs 

68 



TO SERVE OYSTERS RAW IN A BLOCK OP ICE. 69 

found in the terrapin, all the juices that have accumulated 
during the cutting up, and the 2 gills of liquor saved from 
the boiling. Set the terrapin in a china-lined saucepan upon 
a moderate fire. Rub the flour, with a small portion of the 
butter, to a cream. Stir it into the terrapin. Rub the 5 
yolks of eggs to a very smooth paste with the salt, red pep- 
per, butter, and wine. Add them to the terrapin ; stir to 
mix well. When hot, add the cream and serve immediately. 
It must not boil after the cream is added, and indeed must 
not stew more than about 5 minutes from the time it begins 
to cook ; only just long enough to cook the flour, and to 
thoroughly heat the other ingredients as they are added. 
This is highly recommended, being the genuine receipt from 
the best authority. 

BALTIMORE TERRAPIN. 

Have ready a pot of boiling water on the fire. When it 
boils hard, lay in the terrapins and boil until the skin and 
toe-nails will come off (see Philadelphia Terrapin). When 
prepared as directed, cut up the meat. Season to taste with 
cayenne, black-pepper, and salt. Put all into a stewpan with 
the liquor that the terrapin has yielded while being cut up. 
Add no water. To each terrapin allow \ lb. of best butter, 
mixed with a teaspoonful of flour. Cover closely and stew 
gently until the meat is very tender, and serve hot in a deep 
dish. If the allowance of flour is not sufficient, add more. 

N. B. — In removing the gall-bag be careful not to break 
it, or the entire terrapin will be rendered uneatable. 

TO SERVE OYSTERS RAW IN A BLOCK OF ICE. 

Make a hollow in the centre of a block of ice by placing a 
hot flat-iron on the top, in whatever form may be desired. 
Stand the block on a folded napkin upon a platter. Salt 
and pepper the oysters before putting them in the ice. Stand 
in a very cold place until served, that the ice may not melt. 
Decorate with sliced lemon, and serve with cayenne and 
lemon cut in quarters. 



TO GOODJJVJNG. 

RAW OYSTERS ON THE HALF-SHELL. 

HUtTRES. 

Serve the oysters on flat oyster-plates, 6 to each person, 
putting a quarter of a lemon in the centre, and hand black 
and red pepper. Or, use the usual dinner-plate, making a 
bed of finely-chipped ice, on which lay the oysters in their 
shells, 5 or 6 for each person. Hand lemon cut in quarters, 
black and red pepper. A European custom worth importing 
is to hand at the same time tiny tartines made of thinnest 
brown bread, spread with freshest butter, and cut in neat 
diamonds. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

huItres frites. 

50 largest oysters. Egg, 

Fine dried bread-crumbs, sifted, Grated nutm^. 

Salt and pepper, Lard for frying. 

The oysters should be the largest and firmest obtainable ; 
Shrewsburys are best. Wipe them perfectly dry in a clean 
cloth, and feel with your fingers that no pieces of shell remain 
attached to them. Have ready in a saucer the egg slightly 
beaten. Have ready in a bowl the bread-crumbs ; fine rolled 
crackers may be mixed with them. Season the crumbs with 
sjilt, pepper, and a little grated nutmeg. Dip the oysters 
first in egg, then cover thoroughly with the crumbs. Lay 
on a dish, not touching each other, that they may dry. Set 
away for 2 or 3 hours, if you have time. Put lard enough in 
the frying-pan to cover the oysters, ^ring it to a boil. See 
General Directions for Fiying. When the lard is ready, lay 
in the oysters, not close enough to touch ; use a frying-bas- 
ket, if possible. In 3 to 5 minutes they will be done. If 
the lard is deep enough, they will not require turning. As 
they are removed from the lard, lay on a sieve or paper in 
the mouth of the oven. When perfectly freed from grease, 
dish. Serve very hot, garnished with sliced lemon and 
parsley, and neatly arranged on a fancy paper. 



ROAST OYSTERS. 71 

STEAMED OYSTERS. 
Leave a covered dish where it will heat thoroughly. Opea 
wash, and drain the oysters ; put them in a shallow tin pan, 
and place in the steamer. Cover and leave it over boiling 
water until the oysters are puffed and curled, about 10 minutes 
or more ; then put them into a hot dish. They may be 
dressed at table, or butter, salt, and pepper may be added in 
the kitchen. Or, the oysters may be steamed in their shells, 
washing them well beforehand. They should be placed in 
the steamer over boiling water, covered close, and left until 
the shells open easily. 

OYSTER PAN-ROAST. 
Wipe the large, opened oysters dry on a clean cloth, pick- 
ing off all bits of shell. Leave the cloth covered over them 
while you heat a shallow frying-pan very hot. Put in, then, 
a lump of butter, and when it melts, add the oysters and let 
them fry until they begin to brown slightly, turning con-

when browned (20 minutes) serve. 

CODDLED OYSTERS. 

Oysters, Pepper and salt. 

Butter, Toast. 

Drain the liquor from large oysters. Heat a large lump of 
butter in a saucepan. When it is hot, add the liquor. 
When the liquor boils very hard, drop in the oysters and 
cook until the beard curls and the oyster is quite firm. Have 
the bottom of a deep dish covered with slices of toast ; lay 
the oysters on these ; pour the liquor over the toast ; add 
salt and pepper and let stand in a warm place until the 
toast has absorbed all the liquor. There should be no super- 
fluous liquor. If the oysters have yielded too much in the 
first instance, you need use only enough to soak the toast 
well. 

PICKLED OYSTERS. 

100 large oysters, 12 blades of mace, 

2 heaping teaspoons of whole allspice, i sliced lemon, 

2 level " " cloves, i pint of vinegar, 

I lady-finger pepper. Salt to taste. 

Drain the oysters. Free every one from shell or grit, 
being careful not to bruise or tear them. Strain the liquor 
into a china-lined kettle, selecting one that will not scorch 
easily. Add as much boiling water as there is oyster liquor. 
Bring this to a boil. When boiling, lay in the oysters, a few 
at a time, that you may watch them well. Boil until the 
beard curls and the fat part of the oyster feels perfectly 



74 GOOD.LIVING. 

firm between your thumb and finger. Lay them on open 
platters where they will cool. After a while turn them over 
and cool the other side. The oysters must be absolutely 
cold all through, or they will be slimy when pickled. When 
all the oysters are cooked and set to cool, remove the 
liquor from the fire, and wash out the kettle. Strain i quart 
of the liquor into the kettle, add to it i heaping teaspoonful of 
the allspice and i level teaspoonful of cloves — that is twice as 
much of the former ; a small piece of red pepper, about ^ a 
teaspoonful of salt, and 6 leaves of mace. Set it where it 
will simmer for about 30 minutes, until the liquor is well 
flavored with the spices. Meanwhile, as soon as the oysters 
are perfectly cold all through, put them into a stone jar with 
the lemon sliced very thin, (remove the pips), the lady-finger 
pepper, from which remove the seeds, the remainder of the 
cloves, allspice, and mace. When the boiling liquor is suf- 
ficiently flavored, remove it from the fire, add the vinegar, 
(the quantity given is for strong vinegar) ; set it again on the 
fire to heat, and then pour it through a strainer over the 
oysters and fresh spices. Do not use the spices that have 
been boiled. The amount of liquor allowed should cover 
the oysters entirely. Cover the jar and set in a cold place 
for 24 hours before using. If always well covered with the 
pickle, these oysters should keep for several weeks in cold 
weather. If they are to be kept, next day pack the oysters 
in clean preserve-jars ; fill them to cover with the pickle, 
screw on the tops, and set in a cold place. Delicious. 

N. B. — Be careful not to scorch the liquor, or the oysters 
will be spoiled.

Lemon-juice. 

Bring the oysters to a boil in their own juice. Drain 
them. Put the butter into a saucepan ; when hot add the 
onion and flour and stir well until smooth. Now add i gill 
of the juice of a can of mushrooms, pepper, salt, parsley, and

I gill of cream, or 2 of good milk, 2 tablespoons of flour. 

Pinch of corn-starch, Small saltspoon of curry-powder, 

I tablespoon of fine-chopped parsley, Salt. 

Drain the oyster-juice into a saucepan and put on the fire 
to boil. Wipe the oysters, which should be large and firm, 
in a clean cloth, carefully removing any pieces of shell. Put 
in another saucepan the butter and flour. Rub smooth, but 
do not brown. When the oyster-juice, to which you have 
added a little milk (if you have no cream), comes to a boil, 
stir it into the flour very slowly, stirring constantly to prevent 
lumps. Let this boil a few minutes. Rub up the curry- 
powder with a pinch of corn-starch or flour ahd a few drops 
of cold milk or water. Stir this into the sauce. When 
boiling hard, drop in the oysters as dry as possible, and let 
them cook quickly, until you can feel the fat part firm. Add 
salt. If the sauce is not thick enough to cling to the 
oysters, add a little more corn-starch rubbed up in cold milk 
or water, give one boil and serve in a dish bordered with rice. 
Sprinkle parsley over the oysters.

OYSTERS STEWED IN A CHAFING-DISH. 

2 tablespoons of milk or oyster-juice, 25 oysters, 

I heaping teaspoon corn-starch, i teaspoon of butter, 

Salt, pepper, dash of nutmeg, 2 tablespoons of sherry (may be omitted). 

Melt the butter. When it bubbles, put in the oysters 
without the juice. Add pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and put 
the cover on, raising it every little while to stir the oysters 
and turn them. Rub the corn-starch with the milk, if you do 
not use sherry ; if you do use the wine, blend the corn-starch 
with some of the cold oyster-juice. When the beards of the 
oysters begin to curl, stir in the corn-starch. Stir and boil 
until the corn-starch thickens well, then add the sherry ; stir, 
and the oysters are ready to eat. 

OYSTERS EN BROCHETTE. 

HUItRES en BROCHETTE^ 

Take a long skewer (silver or plated is best) ; string upon 
it, alternately, oysters and bits of sliced bacon cut to the size 
of the oysters. The extreme ends should terminate with the 
bacon. When all are in place, broil the whole over a clear 
fire until the oysters are firm. Have some butter melting by 
the side of the fire ; lay the oysters on a hot dish ; pour the 
butter over ; sprinkle with pepper, and salt, and serve. If 
the skewers are not presentable, draw the oysters off and dish 
them alternately with the bacon. 

Very simple and good.

into cold water for a minute ; \vripe dry and mince not too 
fine. Add to this mince half the bulk of any fine, white, 
cold fish minced fine, (or omit this, if not obtainable). Now 
put into a saucepan the butter, i tablespoonful of parsley, 
I teaspoonful of chives chopped very fine, and the mush- 
rooms. Let them stew gently for about 5 minutes, dredging 
in about i teaspoonful of flour when the butter melts ; stir it 
a few times. Add the white wine and Fish-Stock (see re- 
ceipt), or failing this latter, use the same amount of oyster- 
juice strained. Mix. Add the mince, and stew gently until 
all the sauce is entirely absorbed and the mince becomes like 
a thick batter. Be careful it does not scorch. Remove from 
the fire and stir in the yolks of eggs beaten with the cream. 
Stir again over the fire for about i minute. Have ready 
large Croiitons (see receipt), or puff-paste shells ; when the 
mince is ready, serve on these. 
Highly recommended. 

OYSTERS AND MACARONI. 
huItres au macaroni. 

50 oysters parboiled in their own juice, % lb. macaroni, 

I small teacup of cream or White Sauce, Bread-crumbs, 

Cayenne and salt. Grated lemon-peel. 

Boil thei macaroni in salted, boiling water 25 minutes, or 
until very tender. Drain thoroughly. Lay in a deep fire- 
proof dish. Put upon it a thick layer of oysters with 
cayenne, salt, and grated lemon-peel. Pour over all a small 
cupful of cream, or, if you have none, use same quantity of 
White Sauce (see receipt), the consistency of cream. Cover 
the top with bread-crumbs, and brown in a quick oven. 
Serve hot with Sauce Piquante (see receipt). The oysters 
will require fully 10 minutes to complete their cooking in 
the oven, having been boiled only until the beards have be- 
gun to curl. 

TO BOIL A LOBSTER. 
Have a large kettle on the fire with plenty of boiling 
water, deep enough to cover the lobster well. Put in J to i 



BROILED LOBSTER, CALLED A L'AMERICAINE. 79 

cupful of salt. When the water is galloping, put in the 
lobster head-foremost and keep it under water with the poker 
for a minute until it is quiet. Boil 15 to 20 minutes a lobster 
of 2 to 4 pounds. Lobster is even better boiled in sea- 
water. 

N. B. — If a boiled lobster was alive when it was cooked, 
the tail when pressed out, should be elastic and spring back 
instantly. It is advisable never to buy a lobster which has 
not been seen alive ; when, however, it is unavoidable, the 
above may be of service in selecting. 

TO DRESS LOBSTERS COLD. 

Crack the shell of the claws carefully, not to mash the 
meat ; remove it and place upon a dish ; crack the second 
small joint of the claws — pick out the meat also. Now turn 
the lobster on its back ; lay a heavy knife on the middle of 
the tail, all the way up to the body. Give it a gentle blow 
with the hammer ; then with both hands, turn back the shell 
and draw out the tail intact. This leaves the tail still at- 
tached to the body and its shell. Twist off the claws from 
the under side of the body, and open it so that the fat may 
easily be reached. Now open the tail in length half-way 
through on the under side ; remove the black vein from body 
to end. Place the lobster on the dish. Arrange the large 
claws towards the front, and the small claws around as a 
garnish. Dress with parsley and serve. Or the body may also 
be stripped of its shell and opened ; in which case, remove 
the "lady's arm-chair" (or stomach) and sand-bags. This 
is not as pretty a way as the first described, but gives a little 
more edible meat.

the sherry, brandy, and a piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Add a little cayenne. Let all boil for 5 minutes. Prepare 
in a bowl with cream, the yolks of eggs and a little butter. 
Mix well and stir it into the lobster while the latter is boiling. 
Do not let boil again after the cream is added to the lobster, 
or it will curdle. Serve in a very hot dish.

SOFT-SHELL CRABS FRIED. 

Raise the ends of the crabs and remove the sand-bags 
and spongy substance from beneath the shells. Wash well 
and wipe. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put equal parts 
of lard and butter in a frying-pan on the fire ; when boiling, 
lay in the crabs. Turn them when partly done ; leave them 
longest on the •ftrhite or under side. They will take from lo 
to 1 5 minutes to cook, according to size. Rub a little fresh 
butter over the backs of the crabs when dishing, and serve 
very hot. 

BOILED HARDSHELL CRABS. 
Have a large pot of boiling water on the fire. Put in from 
I to 2 gills of salt. When boiling hard, pick up the crabs 
with the kitchen tongs ; drop them into the water head fore- 
most, if they will allow it, and boil rapidly for about lo 
minutes, or until the shells are bright red, but no longer, or 
they will become watery. The livelier they are, the better. 
They must be alive when put into the pot. Crabs do not 
keep long when once cooked ; in summer not over 36 hours ; 
lobsters likewise.

the crabs yield. Recommended. 

FRIED SCALLOPS. 



I quart of scallops. 


Bread-crumbs, 


I egg. 


Lard, 


Pepper, salt, 


Nutmeg. 



Wash the scallops. Wipe dry in a clean cloth. Dip first 
into the egg, which you have beaten sufficiently to mix yolk 
and white; then into fine, sifted, dried bread-crumbs, or 
mixed bread and cracker crumbs. The bread-crumbs must 
be seasoned with salt, pepper and a dash of nutmeg. Lay 
the scallops on a dish, separated, so that the air ;nay dry 
them. Set them away for an hour or more, then fry golden 
brown (see General Directions for Frying). They must 
be shaken constantly so as to prevent browning unevenly. 
The secret of cooking these well, is to dip them nicely, and 
not to fry them more than about 3 minutes, the lard being 
quite boiling. They should be of a pale golden brown. As 
a rule they are cooked too much. Dry well on a sieve or 
paper in the mouth of the oven, and serve very hot on a cut 
paper garnished with parsley and lemon.

Scald the scallops. Chop not too fine. Stir the bread- 
crumbs and scallops into enough White Sauce to blend 
the whole without making it too liquid ; the addition of the 
wine will soften it still more. Add the seasoning, being 
careful to put not enough of any one thing to permit its 
particular flavor to predominate. The quantity of curry 
can never be accurately defined, as it varies greatly in 
strength. The only guide is, that it should not be recogniz- 
able among the other ingredients. Put into buttered shells, 
with browned jaread-crumbs over the tops, dot with butter, 
and bake 5 to 10 minutes, just long enough to heat 
thoroughly through. 



CLAM FRITTERS. Sg 

CLAMS. 

Note. — to open clams without a knife. 

Scrub the shells. Place the clams on their hinges in a 
clean roasting-pan. Pour a few drops of boiling water into

DIRECTIONS FOR REHEATING, ETC. 89 

DIRECTIONS FOR KEEPING ME A TS, ETC., WARM 
AND REHEATING. 

Sufficient attention is not paid to this detail, so important 
to the achievement of furnishing a good table. First of all 
must be laid down the rule that nothing is to be put into 
the oven to keep warm. This is the easiest and most usual 
mode ; but it is a very bad practice, as the kind of heat to 
which the article of food is thus subjected tends to dry the 
surfaces, more or less, to leather or a crisp, and renders the 
dish most unappetizing and unattractive. There is but one 
right way to manage this matter. 

Put upon a dish, bowl, or plate (according to its nature) 
the article of food to be kept hot. Cover it over closely 
with an inverted bowl, dish, or plate, as may be required. 
Make it as nearly air-tight as possible. Fill with boiling 
water a pot or saucepan into the top of which the plate or 
bowl will fit. The saucepan should not be more than half 
full of water. Set the dish or bowl over this ; set the 
saucepan back on the range where the water will be kept 
at boiling point, and let it remain until required. 

By observing these directions, it will be found that most 
dishes will not suffer very much by being kept awhile. 
There are exceptions to the rule. Croquettes do not keep 
hot well in the manner directed. Indeed all fried things 
are spoiled by standing, becoming limp and soggy. They 
should rather be fried at the last moment, or if this is not 
practicable, they may be reheated in the oven, leaving the 
door open and allowing the croquettes to remain only just 
long enough to heat, but not to dry up. 

To reheat an ordinary dish, the hot-water system described 
above should be employed, allowing sufficient time to heat 
slowly. 



BEEF. 
GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

TO ROAST BEEF. 

ROSBIF. 

The best cut of beef for roasting is the sirloin or English 
cut ; that most commonly used is the rib-roast. The former 
has the tenderloin under the rib-bone. A good piece of 
this, where the filet is fine, should weigh at least lo to 
12 pounds. 

Of the rib-roast, the third, fourth and fifth are the choice 
cuts. Two ribs " cut full," as the butchers say, will make a 
good-sized roast and weigh about lolbs. It certainly makes 
a more sightly dish of this cut to have the butcher trim 
out the bones and skewer the end around the eye of the 
meat. It lies nicely on the dish, and looks well; but is 
hardly as sweet as when roasted with the bones left in. If 
the bones are removed, save them for the soup-pot. 

A third cut for roasting which is much used on the con- 
tinent, and very little known here, is the cross-rib ; a solid 
piece of meat, with no bone and only a fair allowance of 
fat. It is a most profitable cut, there being no waste, and it 
certainly contains far richer juices than either of the other 
cuts ; very good qualities in a family where there are many 
children or delicate digestions. 

See that the piece, w;hatever may be the cut selected, is 
neatly skewered, that, when roasted, it may present a proper 
appearance. Place it in the roasting-pan (unless you are 
blessed with an old-fashioned Dutch oven and can roast be- 

90 



TO ROAST BEEF. 9I 

fore the fire). With your hand, rub in as much flour ail 
over as the meat will hold, letting a little drop on the bottom 
of the pan. Put dots of sweet drippings over the top of the 
roast, using about 2 tablespoonfuls in all. Meanwhile, see 
that your fire is in prime order and will not get too low for 
the two hours to come. Turn all the heat into your best 
oven. When the oven is at its hottest and best, set the 
roasting-pan in. Shut the door and leave it for about 2C 
minutes ; by that time it will have begun to brown nicely 
and may require the pan to be turned. If not quite brown 
enough, leave for another 5 or 10 minutes ; then open the 
door, draw out the pan and pour in about i cupful of boiling 
water. Have at hand a long iron spoon with which to baste. 
Baste the meat all over generously. Cover it now with a 
second pan and set it back in the oven. Shut off all the 
extra heat from the oven ; close the draughts, and reduce the 
temperature of the oven to a very moderate heat. Every 10 
or I s minutes baste again. When nearly done, sprinkle quite 
thickly with salt and pepper and baste again. I can hardly 
say " baste " often enough, as so much of the result of the 
roasting depends upon it. The solid piece of 12 lbs. of beef 
will be done, if the above directions are followed, and the 
fire managed lyell, in exactly 2 hours. For a less solid 
piece of the same weight (that is, of more surface and less 
thickness), you would allow less time, say 9 minutes in- 
stead of 10 to the pound. For sirloin, allow eight or nine 
minutes, if liked very under-done. This turns out the beef 
brown and juicy outside, delicate rosy-red and juicy inside ; 
no rawness anywhere through it, unless it has been subjected 
to frost, in which case the time cannot be calculated. For 
those who like their beef brown all the way through, no red- 
ness at all left, you must allow 12 minutes at least to the 
pound, but always following the above directions. The 
sense of the matter is this : The first intense heat of the oven 
sears the meat, keeps in the juices, and gives, at the same 
time, a fine color to the surface and to the gravy which flows 
from it. Lessening the degree of heat afterwards, cooks the 



92 GOOD-LIVING. 

inside without further scorching the surfaces ; and covering 
with a second pan keeps in the juices, prevents too much 
evaporation, as well as too much browning. When once the 
idea of roasting is grasped, a most important addition is made 
to one's accomplishments as a cook. Intelligence and prac- 
tice can do much, although the French do say, " II faut ^tre 
n6 rdtisseur." 

When the meat is cooked, remove the roast to a hot 
platter. Set the roasting-pan on the top of the range. Pour 
in a few drops of water from the kettle, and stir well to de- 
tach all the nutty-brown particles of flour that may have 
adhered to the pan. Boil and stir for 3 or 4 minutes, then 
strain into a gravy-boat, skimming off all the superfluous fat 
(which you keep for drippings). Let me warn you against 
the melancholy practice, which prevails, of adding flour to 
the roasting-pan to burn and thicken the gravy. This is a 
barbarism and a relic of antiquity. Nothing can be better 
than the pure juices of the meat, and there is no more thick- 
ening really required than the stray particles of flour which 
fell from the meat when first put to roast. These have 
cooked well and browned during the time of roasting, and 
serve to make the gravy as rich as it ought to be. The 
system of thickening with burned, bitter-tasting flour cannot 
be too much discouraged. 

There has recently come into use a double-iron pan for 
roasting, which has a great many good qualities, and settles 
satisfactorily the question and use of covering meats while 
roasting. If used, follow very carefully the directions given 
with it, that the roast may be neither too flabby and steamed, 
nor too dried up. The old-fashioned Dutch oven is, of 
course, the best of all ; the patent roaster, with its clockwork 
to make the roast revolve, is also admirable ; unfortunately 
they are fast disappearing. The time allowed for these is 
slightly more than for the oven, but not more than i or 2 
extra minutes to the pound. 

The directions for beef-roasting have been given in detail, 
as the general rules apply equally to nearly all roasted meats. 



A PLAIN BRAISE OR " POT ROAST." 93 

allowing, of course, the difference of time for the various 
kinds, and will serve as reference in many cases. 

Roast beef may be garnished with fresh-scraped (not 
grated) horseradish (this is the English custom) ; also with 
Yorkshire pudding. 



YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

I pint of sifted flour, yi teaspoonful of salt, 

I " " milk, 4 eggs. 

Put the flour in a large bowl with f of the milk, the salt, 
and eggs. Beat and blend thoroughly ; then add the rest of 
the milk. This quantity may be baked in a pan 12 x 8 x i 
inch deep. Pour in some of the drippings from the pan in 
which the beef is roasting. When the pan is hot, pour in the 
batter upon the drippings, and bake from 30 to 40 minutes. 
Cut in square pieces and dish around the roast beef. 



A PLAIN BRAISE OR " POT-ROAST." 

Heat an iron pot ; put in a very little sweet drippings 
(for poultry, butter is best) ; when hot, lay in the beef or 
poultry ; if meat, sear it ; if chicken, brown it a delicate gold 
color, uncovered. To this, add a small onion and a small carrot 
chopped and fried in butter till very brown, but not burned. 
Pour in boiling water to barely half the height of the meat or 
chicken ; add salt and pepper, and cover as tightly as 
possible. Thicken the gravy or not, as you prefer. To 
imitate a plain roast, do not thicken it. If thickened, use a 
Roux(see receipt). Simmer 2 to 6 hours, according to weight 
and toughness (see Time-Table). Veal must be cooked more 
slowly and gently than any other meat, otherwise it becomes 
stringy, and is indigestible. If mutton is tough, it will be 
found a great improvement to beat it thoroughly with a 
rolling-pin before cooking it.

To be perfect, this should be made of a piece from the best 
side of the round, weighing at the very least lO (preferably 
12 or 14) lbs., so that it shall not be less than 51- to 6 inches 
thick when cooked ; but, of course, for a small family, a 
smaller piece can be used, provided it be chunky, not long 
and thin. The cross-rib cut is excellent for this purpose ; 
quite as tender, very juicy, and much more compact than a 
piece of round of the same weight. 

If you are in town, have your butcher lard it for you ; if 
in the country, and have to do it yourself, cut strips of fat 
pork 3 or 4 inches by ^ an inch thick. Make incisions 
with a sharp knife at equal distances of about 2 inches, and 
insert the strips of pork. Repeat this operation on the sec- 
ond side of the beef. Here and there make incisions and 
stuff in a little force-meat very highly flavored with parsley, 
thyme, and a little chopped onion. The force-meat may be 
made of bread-crumbs, etc. (see list of ingredients). Now tie 
the beef very neatly in a round, with strips of muslin or 
tape ; string of any kind gives it a ribbed, ugly appearance 
when cooked. 

Heat an iron pot a little larger than your beef. Throw in 



BEEF A LA MODE. 95 

a few slices of salt pork. When the fat is melted, and the 
pot fiercely hot, push the pork aside and lay in the beef. 
Do not cover. Let it sear lo minutes on one side, then turn 
and sear lo minutes on the other side. The fire must be 
intensely hot during this operation ; if not, the beef must 
sear a few minutes longer. This keeps in the juices of the 
meat. In a separate frying-pan, fry meanwhile 2 or 3 sliced 
onions in butter. When the beef is turned on its second 
side, throw the onions upon it. Then put into the same 
frying-pan i tablespoonful of butter and 2 of flour; stir 
together until of a rich brown color, but do not burn ; then 
add by degrees enough boiling water to blend it. Pour this 
over the beef, when the latter has been long enough on the 
second side. Add to the pot sufficient boiling water to half 
cover the beef. Let it come to a smart boil. Add 2 carrots 
and a bunch of celery, cut in pieces, a bunch of parsley, 
6 cloves, 12 allspice, \ a lady-finger pepper (without seeds), 
I bay-leaf, i large or two small cloves of garlic, i tablespoon- 
ful of vinegar. Cover the pot as tightly as possible to keep 
in the steam. If necessary, wrap a cloth around the top to 
prevent the escape of steam. Set on the back of the range 
where it will keep up a steady, gentle simmer. It must cook 
very slowly. Indeed this is the most important rule for this 
mode of cooking. After the first 2 or 3 minutes, it must 
cook very slowly ; were it to boil, it would become stringy 
and go to pieces, instead of melting into tenderness and 
retaining its juices and its shape perfectly. For 10 lbs. 
allow 6 hours. If it is done before that time you may know 
that you have cooked it "too fast. This includes the time 
taken for the searing. Watch it well, and if your fire has 
been too quick, and it is done before the allotted 6 hours, 
set it aside where it will keep hot, but not cook any more. 
When it is time to serve the beef, remove it to a hot 
platter; pick out some of the best pieces of vegetable to 
garnish the dish ; skim and strain the gravy ; add seaspnings 
and I gill of wine. Pour a little gravy over the beef, and 
serve the rest in a sauce-boat. Treasure every drop of it. 



96 GOOD.LIVING. 

N. B. — Should the gravy steam away in the cooking, you 
can add a little boiling water now and again, but very little at 
a time. The gravy should be delicious. 

Beef k la Mode is really much better cold than hot. If you 
want to serve it cold, manage it in this way : When you have 
dished your meat and strained the gravy, return to the pot 
all the thick part left in the strainer ; add to it a little broth 
or boiling water. Stir and boil for a few minutes. When 
you want to put away the beef, lay it in a deep bowl, mix all 
the gravy that remains with the broth in the pot ; strain the 
whole over the beef ; shut up tight to keep in the steam, and 
set away in a cool place. This is a very simple way of mak- 
ing a delicious dish. It will keep for several days in winter. 



BRAISED BEEF, OR BEEF EN DA UBE. 

BCEUF BRAIS£ OR EN DAUBE. 

Is treated almost exactly the same as Beef k la Mode, ex- 
cept that it need not be larded. The cross-rib cut is excel- 
lent for this ; but for that matter almost any of the usual 
cuts may be used. The " horseshoe *' does very well also, 
if cooked slowly enough and long enough. For the real 
daube, however, use the cross-rib. Sear as described in the 
receipt for Beef k la Mode, after tying up the piece neatly. 
Add the same vegetables and seasonings, and i cup of 
stewed tomatoes. The same remarks also apply to the 
mode of cooking. Allow 5 hours for 8 lbs., 6 hours for 10 
lbs. Watch it, and see that it cooks slowly enough. For a 
family dinner, serve with the vegetables, as they are excel- 
lent ; otherwise, serve without the vegetables. 

Braising (or "pot-roasting") is a most useful process of 
cooking, as it serves for nearly every kind of meat and poul- 
try, and is an excellent resource when one is not perfectly 
certain that one's joint is very tender. Try the same process 
for rabbits, pigeons, poultry, veal, and mutton. 



ROASTED FILET, ETC. 97 

BOILED BEEF, 

BOUILLI. 

Select what is called by the butchers the "horseshoe" 
piece. It should weigh at least 8 lbs., and from that to lo or 
12. Put it into a large pot, and cover it with cold water, al- 
lowing I quart to each pound of meat. Bring gradually to a 
boil. Set on one side of the range where it will simmer 
steadily, without a moment's intermission, until done. Al- 
low from 32 to 35 minutes per lb., counting from the time 
the beef is put on the fire, not (as usual) from the time 
the water begins to boil. Calculate the time, and 2 hours 
before it is to be done, add 2 or 3 carrots, cut in strips, a 
large bunch of celery-leaves or head of same, 2 or 3 onions, 
parsley, i or 2 leaves of cabbage (if winter), 2 or 3 turnips, 
cut and trimmed neatly, and i teaspoonful of salt. When 
the beef is done (it should be cooked until almost, but not 
quite, ready to go to pieces), remove it to a hot dish. Have 
ready a rich Tomato Sauce (see receipt). Pour some of the 
sauce over the beef ; arrange some of the vegetables around, 
and serve the rest of the Tomato Sauce in a boat. This is 
the national dish of the French people, and it is really excel- 
lent, if properly cooked. Allow the broth to boil down 
to one half or one third of its original quantity ; strain and 
set away. Some of it may be served, if necessary, the same 
day, with the vegetables boiled with it cut in fine pieces, 
mixed and served on a separate dish (see Pot-au-feu). A few 
pieces of dry toast should be put into the tureen. 

ROASTED FILET OF BEEF, LARDED,

Use a larding-needle. Place a strip of the pork in the open 
end of the needle, pushing it in as far as it will go. With this

take a stitch on the uppermost side of the filet, the stitch be- 
ing about i inch long, penetrating the meat only about \ 
an inch. Put your finger on the end of the strip of pork 
and draw it out of the needle, leaving the ends of the pork 
exposed about \ an inch at either end of the stitch. Repeat 
this in even rows all down the centre of the side that is to 
stand uppermost ; begin a new row then about i inch 
apart ; try to make the ends of the new row come opposite 
the spaces in the first row. Repeat these rows until all the 
upper side is filled (or your patience exhausted). They 
must look very neat and even. In the bottom of a baking- 
pan lay I small onion, small carrot, stick or two of celery, all 
cut in pieces, 4 cloves, and i bay-leaf. Lay the filet on this 
bed, larded side uppermost. Dredge with pepper, and put 
bits of butter over the top. In the pan put about 4 table- 
spoonfuls of boiling water. Bake in a quick oven, basting 
frequently, for about 45 minutes. Some authorities say 30 
minutes, if the oven is very quick. It must feel quite elastic 
under pressure, as it is always eaten underdone. Remove 
the filet to a hot platter. Put in the pan i tablespoonful of 
butter and 2 of flour ; stir them together over the fire until 
brown. Add i pint of broth, including the strained pan- 
gravy. Stir. Boil 5 minutes. Strain ; add i pint of fresh 
or canned mushrooms ; cook 5 minutes, then remove from 
the fire; add i teaspoonful of Worcestershire Sauce, i 
tablespoonful of sherry, salt and pepper to taste. Pour it 
around the filet and serve.

them from side to side, leaving no one side longer than the 
other. They will take about 8 minutes under an intense 
fire. Have ready a tablespoonful of butter (or more accord- 
ing to the number of filets) rubbed up with an equal quan- 
tity of chopped parsley and the juice of |- a lemon. As the 
filets are cooked, place them on a hot dish, spread them 
thickly with this Maitre d'H6tel Butter ; sprinkle with pep- 
per and salt. Cover with a second hot dish and stand in the 
open oven door for 2 or 3 minutes before serving, that the 
butter may melt. . Add the juices from the pan. The filets 
should be dished in a circle, one overlapping the other. Fill 
the centre with parsley, or with some delicate pur6e, or fresh 
peas. Or serve with Madeira Sauce, with chopped truffles 
and mushrooms.

Cut the salt pork in long narrow strips and throw into a 
bowl of cold water to harden. Lard the side that is to stand 
uppermost. Use a larding-needle. Proceed as directed in 
receipt for Roasted Filet of Beef Larded. The larding 
must be very evenly and neatly done. It is one of the 
finesses of cookery that requires to be demonstrated, at 
least once, by one who has the knack of it ; description is not 
of very much assistance. Having larded the upper side, 
then, proceed with the mode of cooking as follows : 

Choose a pot with a cover to fit, or a double pan that will 
fit in your oven. Having cut up the vegetables, fry them 
slightly in a frying-pan with a little butter ; lay these in the 
pan in which you are to cook the filet, larding uppermost ; 



lOO GOOD-LIVING. 

add the spices and seasoning, wine, and only enough boiHng- 
water to quite half-cover the filet. Close it tightly. , Bring 
it to a boil, then set it back where it will barely simmer for 
I hour to I hour and 20 minutes, according to the weight 
and thickness of the filet. Then remove the cover of the 
pot ; set in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, basting fre- 
quently. The meat should, when done, be slightly elastic 
under the pressure of the fork. Never pierce meat to see if 
it is cooked ; after very little experience you will be able to 
tell by the firmness or slight elasticity under pressure 
whether the meat is thoroughly done or slightly underdone. 
When ready to remove the filet to a hot dish, strain the gravy 
into a boat, skim and serve. This is a perfectly plain, un- 
garnished filet, deliciously flavored and juicy. It is never as 
red and soft as when simply roasted, but is none the less 
good for all that. On the contrary, the above mode of treat- 
ing a filet will be a revelation of new delights to those who 
only know the soft, water-soaked, tasteless mass that most 
filets are when cooked by the commonplace cook. Having 
the foundation well-prepared, you can garnish the filet in 
any of the various ways directed below.

saucepan. Place the saucepan in the oven and bake for 20 
to 30 minutes ; longer if the tomatoes are large. Remove 
the cover and leave the tomatoes in the oven until they are 
slightly browned. When the filet is ready, strain the gravy ; 
thicken it slightly with a roux of i small teaspoon of butter 
and I of flour browned over the fire. Blend the boiling 
gravy into it. Boil 5 minutes. Add a little wine. Place 
the filet in the middle of the dish, the tomatoes around, and 
serve the gravy in a boat. Add any juices that may remain 
in the saucepan in which the tomatoes were cooked. Garnish 
the dish with parsley, etc., and serve. 

TO BROIL A BEEFSTEAK. 

BIFTEK. 

The best cut unquestionably is the porter-house steak ; the 
next best is the sirloin (of which in turn, there is a choice of 
cuts) ; this is always a large steak, weighing from 3 to 4^ lbs., 
and it is not all profitable for broiling, there being quite a 
long, coarse end which is only fit for stewing, etc. The 
second best small steak, weighing from i to 2 lbs., is the 
rib-steak, and also the " short-steak ; " the most nutritious 
and profitable, of course, is the round. The latter must 
always be well-beaten and broiled quickly. If beaten enough, 
it is excellent, the meat being much richer than the finer cuts. 
The porter-house to be perfect should be cut very thick, i 
inch at least to i^. 

If large, the steak should under no circumstances be broiled 
over the fire. Before beginning, see that the fire is clear 
and clean. Place the gridiron where it will heat very hot. 
Grease it. Lay the steak upon it, and in about i minute 
turn it over. It must be turned very often, one side remain- 
ing no longer than the other. An ordinary steak |- of an inch 
thick should not require more than 8 or 10 minutes, to be 
served done through, but red and juicy. Do not pierce it 
with a fork to ascertain if it is done ; press it with the flat 



^RAISED BEEFSTEAK WITH BROWN GRAVY. 103 

side of a knife or fork, and if only slightly elastic, it is done 
enough. The firmer it is under pressure, the more cooked it 
is. It should be served as described, red and juicy. Have 
ready a tablespoonf ul of butter rubbed up with a tablespoon- 
ful of chopped parsley and juice of J a lemon. When the 
steak is cooked, place it on a hot platter, and butter it over 
with this Maitre d'H6tel Butter. Place it in the oven with 
the door shut for i minute to melt the butter ; sprinkle with 
salt and pepper and serve. Of course a large sirloin steak 
will require longer to cook. If the fire is very clear and free 
from gas, the small steaks may be broiled over it ; but the 
practice should be discouraged as much as possible, as it is 
the cause of much black, smoked meat, and of a very un- 
pleasant flavor of coal-gas, if not managed by a careful, 
clevef cook. 

BROILED STEAK A LA SHREWSBURY. 

Broil a thick porter-house, steak as directed. Select fine, 
large, fresh mushrooms. Peel the tops, scrape the stalk and 
cut it off about half an inch from the top. Lay these upper- 
side down on a hot broiler and broil until tender ; they will 
not require more than 5 minutes. Turn, but broil longest 
on the upper side. Have some butter softened ; baste the 
mushrooms with this. Dish them around the beefsteak. 
Pour more butter over them ; sprinkle with salt and pepper 
and serve.

with it on both sides ; lay it in the kettle with the water, 
wine, spices and i oz. of the butter rubbed with half an oz, 
of flour. Cover closely and simmer gently until the beef is 
tender, which will take from 2 to 3 hours, or, if the beef is 
tough, possibly a little more. It must be cooked very slowly. 
When tender, heat the frying-pan very hot, melt in it a little 
piece of the butter ; lay the beef in the butter, turn once, 
frying until the outside is browned. Be careful not to harden 
it. Then fry the oysters in the same pan. Lay the beef on 
a platter with the oysters. Strain the gravy into the frying- 
pan (there should be about i pint) ; rub the rest of the flour 
smooth with a few drops of cold water ; stir it into the boiling 
gravy, and boil for 5 minutes ; longer if not quite thick enough. 
Pour over the beef and serve. 

BEEFSTEAK PUDDING OR POT-PIE. 

Beefsteak from the round,. Salt and pepper, 

Butter and flour, 6 onions, parboiled, 

I teaspoon of mushroom catsup, ^^ gill of water. 

The steak selected should be pounded almost to a pulp, 
then pressed back into a proper thickness and cut in pieces 2 
by 5 inches. Season with salt and pepper. Butter a tin 
tnould that will hold i quart ; or use a china bowl if pre- 
ferred. Make a good meat-pie paste (see receipts for Suet, 
Potato or Good Plain Paste). Line the mould, letting the 
paste lap over the edge. Dredge the beef with flour, and lay 
it in the mould with the small onions parboiled, the catsup 
and water. Wet the edges of the paste ; place a cover of 
paste over; press the edges together closely, and tie the 
mould in a clean cloth. Have ready on the fire a pot of 
boiling water. Place the mould in it, top uppermost, and 
boil for 4 hours. When cooked, turn it out and serve. A 
crust may be made by mixing baking-powder with flour in 
the proportions of i teaspoonful of powder to i cup of flour ; 
allow \ a pound of mixed lard and butter to i pound of the 
flour. Crumb the butter, lard and flour together ; add enough 
cold water to make the paste just soft enough to roll out. If 



BEEFSTEAK AND ONIONS NO. II. 10$ 

this crust is not rich enough, add a larger proportion of short- 
ening. Always sift the baking-powder with the flour, before 
mixing the flour with the shortening. Roll the under-crust 
about ^ an inch thick, the top crust i inch, or nearly. It 
will swell of course ; but for this sort of pie it is well to have 
the crust thick. , 

The same receipt may be used for Chicken Pot-pie or Veal 
Pot-pie, using a little ham with either, adding a pinch of 
thyme to the seasoning.

Stew the onions in a saucepan with the water, butter, and 
seasonings ; dredge in a little flour, and stir it through the 
onions. When the onions are very tender, lay in the sauce- 
pan a well-broiled beefsteak, and stew together for lo min- 
utes. If round-steak is used, beat it almost to a pulp with 
the rolling-pin ; cut off the skin, and, when beaten, press back 
into shape and into a proper thickness before broiling. Do 
not on any consideration fry the steak. When finished, 
dish the steak and cover it all over with the onions. The 
onions will require nearly an hour of very gentle stewing to 
cook them tender.

beef ; add salt and pepper and enough boiling water to half 
cover the beef. Cover the pot. Bring to a boil briskly, 
then set back where it will only simmer very gently for i^ to 
2 hours. Or, you can cover the pot very closely and set it 
in the oven for the same length of time, turning the meat 
once. If the fire is not too strong the beef will be very 
tender cooked in this way. A little boiling water may be 
added if the gravy evaporates too fast. Dish the beefsteak 
with the onions covering it completely. There should be 
quite a good quantity of gravy when it is cooked. Pour this 
over also. N. B. — This is a Beefsteak and Onions so deli- 
cate and inoffensive that very few can fail to like, it, where 
the first receipt might be found too rich.

strips of muslin. Set aside 12 hours. Then put into a stew- 
pan ; cover with water and simmer 3J hours. Thicken 
the gravy with flour and boil \ an hour longer ; 4 hours

Mix the spices, salt, and pepper ; with this rub both sides 
of the beef; mix together the oil, vinegar, lemon-juice, ana 
melted butter ; pour this over the meat in an earthen dish. 
Let stand 24 hours in summer ; longer if you choose, say 3 
days, in winter, turning, in the former case once, in the latter 
once each day, and keep in a cold place. Then put it, with 
all the juices and spices, into a stewpan ; add the bay-leaves, 
I tablespoonful more of vinegar, a pinch of sugar, and I 
clove of garlic. Half cover with boiling water. Fry the 
onions brown in butter ; add them to the beef. Then mix 
together until brown, i tablespoonful of butter and i of 
flour ; blend with a little boiling water and add also to the 
beef, stirring it in. Cover closely and set in the oven for 
about 2 hours, turning the beef once when half-cooked. 
When ready, remove the beef to a hot dish ; set the pan on 
the top of the range. If the gravy has cooked away too 
much, add a little boiling water ; stir it around ; boil for a 
few minutes, then strain through a fine strainer ; put a little 
over the meat and serve the rest in a sauce-boat. 

The " brisket " and " plate-piece " are both best when cooked 
in this way. The latter is most frequently corned, in which 
case boil it. It must be uncorned to cook as above directed. 
If either of these cuts is used the gravy must be carefully 
skimmed. Allow 25 to 30 minutes per pound.

Leave the beef in one solid piece. It should be a chuhky 
cut from the cross-rib, horseshoe or sirloin-butt. Place it 
over a moderate fire in a pot with water enough to cover the 
meat. Add the tomatoes, okra, onions, corn ; season with

takes away a good deal of the salt, which is sometimes ex- 
cessive. Add the cream ; or use instead the same quantity 
of Cream or White Sauce (see receipts). Season with pep-

aside. Flour the tongue all over and put into the hot pan 
with the butter. Turn it on all sides until browned slightly. 
Put the tongue and all the other ingredients, except the 
lemon-juice, into a pot which will fit in the oven. Close the 
lid as tightly as possible to keep in the steam. Place the 
pot in the oven. After \\ hours open the pot, turn the 
tongue and add the lemon-juice. Close as before and leave 
\ an hour longer in the oven. Now put the tongue on a 
hot dish and set it over hot water while you boil down the 
gravy for 20 or 30 minutes, until of a good strength. If it is 
not quite thick enough, mix a heaping teaspoonful of corn- 
starch with a little cold water, stir it into the boiling gravy 
and boil 2 or 3 minutes. Strain some of the gravy over the 
tongue ; serve the rest in a sauce-boat.

Prepare the meat as for Corn-Beef Hash. Butter a quart 
mould; pack the hash in it and bake i hour in the oven. 
Turn it out and serve. 

CORN-BEEF. 

The most popular cut for this is the, rump, a three-cor- 
nered piece with sweet fat, but at least one third bone. The 
best and most profitable, as well as the most delicate, cut, is 



1 14 GOOD.LIVING. 

that from the lower round ; a long, narrow piece perfectly 
free from bone, and much more sightly. It costs a little 
more per pound, but it is quite worth the difference. The 
plate and navel pieces are also excellent in their own way, but 
should be eaten cold, not hot. 

Put the corn-beef down to boil in a large pot of cold 
water. Let it be well covered. Bring it gradually to a boil. 
When well started, set aside to cook very gently — simmer, 
not boil. Allow 20 to 25 minutes to the pound, counting 
from the time when the water begins to boil. Calculate the 
time, and when it is within 2 hours of being cooked, add 2 
or 3 turnips, carrots, celery leaves, i or 2 onions, or i clove 
of garlic. Finish the cooking. Dish with the vegetables 
around. Keep the water in which the beef has boiled. When 
it is ready to be set away, return it to the pot of broth ; cover 
and set away to cool. The difference made by this system is 
incredible, the beef being deliciously tender when served cold. 
If not too salt, use the broth as soup with a pur6e of potatoes, 
beans, or peas, etc. Serve the beef, if liked, with cabbage, but 
never boil the cabbage with the beef, as it renders both very 
indigestible. To be good, corn-beef should be boiled until as 
tender as chicken. The secret of this is, to cook it slowly 
and long. 

CORN-BEEF HASH. 

Chop the meat fine, rejecting all hard gristle. Add half 
the bulk of potatoes chopped not too fine. (N. B. The pota 
toes for this should always be boiled with their skins on and 
not allowed to be peeled until they are cold.) Put into a 
saucepan a lump of butter as large as an egg, for a moderate 
amount of hash. Add a few spoonfuls of boilinjj water; 
when bubbling, put in the meat and potatoes mixed, very 
little salt and plenty of pepper. Let it heat ; stir now and 
again, but be careful not to mash the potatoes. Then let it 
stand still 10 or 15 minutes until it forms a crust at the 
bottom. Form it into a neat loaf shape. Do not let it get 
too dry. Loosen it from the pan with a cake turner; turn a

warm platter over it ; turn pan and dish together quickly and 
serve. Only put toast under if the hash is scant in quantity 
or not browned. A half onion grated is esteemed by some 
a valuable addition ; if used, see that it is grated and not 
chopped, as the common practice is ; and a mistaken one it is 
too, for the onion, of course, remains quite raw. A few 
tablespoonfuls of stewed tomatoes and a few celery and 
parsley leaves chopped very fine make a delicious addition to 
the above. Recommended. 

Chicken Hash may be prepared as above, without brown- 
ing ; also Turkey Hash. 

CORN-BEEF CROQUETTES. 

\% lbs. of mashed potatoes, lo oz. of beef, chopped fine, 

1 J^ oz. of butter, 4 oz. of stale bread or cracker, 

^ gill of cream, I tablespoon of chopped parsley. 

Pinch of grated nutmeg. Salt and pepper, 

2 eggs, Cup of lard. 

Pass the potato through a colander. When the beef is 
chopped very fine, add the butter to the hot potato, then the 
cream, i egg, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Beat thoroughly 
together. Now mix the beef (without gristle) with the rest ; 
make it into rolls 1X2 inches long. (Be sure the surface 
is smooth.) Place them on a floured tin and let them stand 
in the ice-box while you beat the other egg and prepare the 
bread- or cracker-crumbs, sifting the latter. Roll the cro- 
quettes first in the egg, then in bread-crumbs, and let them 
stand I or 2 hours, if you have time. Bring the lard to 
a boil. It should be 2 inches deep in the pan. Lay the 
croquettes in the frying-basket, and when you are sure the 
lard is boiling, plunge them in. (See General Directions for 
Frying.) Fry golden brown. Drain dry. Serve with 
parsley and lemon, on a folded napkin. Excellent. 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 

GENERAL REMARKS ON MUTTON. 

The great point of having mutton sufficiently mature 
before cooking becomes quite a perplexing question in 
summer, when the meat is liable to spoil before it has been 
hung long enough to become tender. If you are in the 
country, the following simple and most effective mode of 
treatment may be possible for you to practise. It has been 
followed, within my own experience, very frequently, and 
with perfectly satisfactory results. 

The day before you wish to use the piece of mutton, be it 
leg or saddle, have a hole dug in the garden, wrap your 
mutton in a clean, white cloth, lay it deep down in the hole, 
cover the earth tightly over it and leave it until next morn- 
ing. Then dig it out, set it in a cool place where it can not 
spoil, and cook it for dinner. If a leg, it will be further 
improved by being very thoroughly beaten with the rolling- 
pin on all sides. It is quite remarkable how the burying 
process will shorten the fibre of the meat and produce the 
same results as are obtained by hanging for days at a cooler 
season of the year. 

Note. — Never attempt to keep mutton without cooking 
after it has been beaten. 

The directions given for the time in cooking mutton (see 
Time-Table) are based upon the consideration that, being a 
dark meat, it should always be served underdone. Those 
who prefer it cooked brown all through should allow 12 or 

116

ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

GIGOT DE MOUTON r6tL 

Select a large leg of Canada mutton. Let it hang, accord- 
ing to the weather, as long as it will keep sweet. In winter, 
with care and favorable weather, it can sometimes hang 6 
weeks and be all the better for it ; of course the same is not 
the case in summer (see General Remarks on Mutton ). A 
good leg should weigh at least 10 pounds cut close — that is, 
without any of the loin attached. Having hung it as long as 
possible, lay it on a board, and with the rolling-pin, beat the 
entire leg all over until it feels very tender under pressure. 
Let the blows be very heavy and do not spare them. This 
is the French method, and when you have once tried it, 
(especially upon a leg of whose tenderness you have enter- 
tained doubts), you will be amazed that it is not made a 
general practice. Have your oven very hot. Put the leg 
into a baking-pan with the knuckle turned up a little; 
skewer it in place if necessary. Rub it all over with flour ; 
introduce a clove of garlic into the hock-end near the bone, 
if liked ; put dots of drippings or butter on the top, and 
a large lump in the pan. Put it into the oven for about 20 
minutes, or until it begins to brown nicely ; at the end 
of this time, if the meat is sufficiently brown, turn off the 
excessive heat, but do not cool the oven too much. If 
in danger of browning too much, cover it with an inverted 
pan. Baste very frequently. After the first half hour, you 
may add a very little boiling water, not more than i gill, to 
the pan. If it steams away, add again more, but very little 
at a time. Allow 10 minutes per lb., which would make the 
leg of 'lo lbs. sufficiently cooked in i hour and 40 minutes. 
It should be underdone when served. Remove the meat 
from the pan to a hot dish ; place the pan on the top of the 
range ; add a very little boiling water ; stir it around to detach

the particles and juices ; skim and strain into a boat. Garnish 
the dish with parsley, and put a frill of cut paper on the bone. 

As an excellent addition to the above, peel and boil i 
dozen small turnips until almost tender ; cut them in halves 
and lay them in the pan with the roasting mutton 30 or 40 
minutes before this latter should be served. When you dish 
the mutton, put a circle of these browned turnips around it, 
and serve with the gravy as above. Avoid thickening the 
gravies of roasted meats ; this is a common and shocking 
practice in our country. The ordinary cook thickens them 
with a bitter preparation of burnt flour, which utterly de- 
stroys the true flavor of the meat. There can be nothing 
more wholesome or better, surely, than the juice of the meat 
itself, especially that which runs from it in carving. 

N. B. — Never pierce your roasted meat with a fork before 
it is cut at the table. You can ascertain quite sufficiently by 
pressure if the meat is cooked, without piercing it and thus 
allowing it to bleed. If well cooked and handled, the juice 
should almost spout from a leg of mutton, when carved, be 
it roasted or boiled. 

ROAST SADDLE OF MUTTON. 

SELLE DE MOUTON r6tIE. 

Having selected the saddle very carefully and hung or 
buried it (see General Remarks on Mutton) until perfect, 
wipe it clean ; put it in a roasting-pan with 4 tablespoonfuls 
of boiling water. Dredge the top with flour, dot with sweet 
drippings, and bake in a very quick oven, allowing about 9 
minutes to the pound, as the saddle is considered properly 
cooked only when very underdone. Baste frequently. Gar- 
nish the tail with a frill of cut paper; put slices of lemon 
and parsley around and serve very hot, with the pan-gravy 
skimmed in the sauce-boat. Serve currant jelly at the same 
time. 

Note. — The plates on which the mutton is served should 
be very hot.

BOILED LEG OF MUTTON. 

GIGOT DE MOUTON BOUILLI, SAUCE AUX CAPRES. 

Leg of mutton, i bay-leaf, 

Sprig of thyme, Salt and pepper. 

Have ready a clean cloth in which roll the leg of mutton 
with the seasonings. Have a pot on the fire with boiling 
water sufficient to cover the meat. Be sure the water is 
boiling. Put in the leg, and keep on a steady but gentle 
boil until done, allowing 1 5 minutes to every pound of meat, 
calculating from the time the water comes again to a boil. 
Do not let it " rack " at any time. When done, remove the 
cloth and serve with Caper Sauce (see receipt), or with a 
Purde of Turnips (see receipt). 

N. B. — If the meat appears tough before cooking, beat it 
smartly for a few minutes with a rolling-pin. 

^RAISED LEG OF MUTTON. 

GIGOT BRAIS6 AUX NAVETS. 

Having beaten it well, proceed as directed in receipt for 
Plain Braise, if you wish to insure making a tough leg 
good eating, and have it appear as though it had been 
roasted; or, proceed as directed in receipt for Beef k la 
Mode, omitting the larding; in this case the bone should 
be removed and the space thus left filled with force-meat or 
dressing. If the latter, serve with turnips peeled, parboiled, 
and finished for at least I hour with the mutton; this is 
highly recommended.

BREAST OF MUTTON A U GRA TIN. 

POITRINE DE MOUTON AU GRATIN. 

Breast of mutton. Parsley and sweet herbs, 

I onion. Bread-crumbs, 

I egg, Butter, 

Pepper, salt, Cayenne. 

Boil the breast of mutton slowly until you can draw out 
the bones easily. This will take \\ to 2 hours, according 
to the age of the mutton. Remove it from the fire ; take 
out all the bones, without breaking the meat in pieces. Lay 
it between 2 dishes under a weight overnight. Next day, 
stand it in the oven until warm ; score the top and rub in a 
mixture made of i egg, chopped parsley, grated onion, pow- 
dered herbs, salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne. Ovef all, 
sift fine bread-crumbs ; put dots of butter over the crumbs 
and set in the oven until well-browned, or from 20 to 30 
minutes, if the oven is not too hot. Serve with Sauce 
Poivrade (see receipt), or with Mushroom Sauce. 

N. B. — If you will put 2 carrots, i turnip, 2 or 3 onions, all 
cut in pieces, and other seasonings in the pot when you boil 
the mutton first, you will have an excellent soup, if it is 
allowed to boil down sufficiently. Add a little rice or barley 
to the soup when you remove the mutton. 

BROILED MUTTON CHOPS-. 

c6tELETTES DE MOUTON GRILLi^ES. 

Use the breast chops for daintiness and appearance; or 
the loin chops for sweetness and solidity; the former 
" frenched," the latter trimmed neatly and the tails cut off. 
The loin chops should be cut i inch thick; the French 
chops rather thinner. Beat them with a few heavy, firm 
strokes of the rolling-pin. Have the gridiron heated very 
hot. Broil under a bright, clear fire. Grease the gridiron. 
Lay the chops upon it, and in a few seconds turn them, that 
they may become instantly seared and preserve their juices. 



BREADED MUTTON CHOPS. 121 

Continue to turn frequently, never allowing one side to re- 
main longer than the other exposed to the fire. This is the 
secret of broiling well : a clear, scorching fire, and constant 
attention, turning very frequently. As soon as the meat 
feels at all firm under the pressure of the fork (do not pierce 
it) the chops are cooked. Butter them thickly and sprinkle 
with pepper and salt. If French chops, put frilled papers 
on the handles and dish in a circle, one overlapping the 
other, with a purde of some kind in the centre. Loin 
chops are preferred for breakfast ; the smaller French chops 
for dinner. ' 

MUTTON CUTLETS. 

These are slices cut from the thick part of the leg, and 
are most excellent. Beat as described above; remove the 
outer skin and broil as directed for mutton chops. Serve 
with a pur6e of spinach as a garnish. Lamb cutlets are also 
excellent with fresh peas. 

BREADED MUTTON CHOPS. 
c6telettes de mouton pan]£es. 

For this purpose use only the rib-chops. Have them 
" frenched " — that is, the handles cleaned and eyes trimmed. 
Beat with a few vigorous strokes of the rolling-pin. Dip 
them on all sides in melted butter. Sprinkle with pepper 
and salt, and dip in fine bread-crumbs. Let them stand an 
hour, if possible, in the ice-box to dry. Bring some lard to 
a boil. It should be deep enough to cover the chops. Lay 
them in and fry until golden brown and moderately firm 
under pressure, turning once. They should require about € 
or 8 minutes to cook, being served underdone. 

Or, sear the chops in a hot pan with a little butter — that is, 
lay them first one side then the other for about two minutes 
each ; when cold, dip in egg, then in fine bread-crumbs, and 
after letting them stand about I hour, fry them until golden 
brown in boiling hot lard. Test the lard, and be certain it is

hot enough, or the chops will be greasy and not a success. 
Have ready frills for the handles ; slip these on ; dish in 
a circle, overlapping each other ; put fresh green peas in the 
centre and parsley around. Serve. 

MUTTON CHOPS EN PAPILLOTE. 
c6telettes de mouton en papillotes. 

% lb. sausage meat, i yolk of egg, 

I onion, chopped, 2 tablespoons of butter, 

6 loin chops, i teaspoon of chopped parsley, 

Salt, Pepper. 

Melt half of the butter in the frying-pan ; when hot, sear 
the chops quickly on both sides. Take them out. Sprinkle 
with salt and pepper. Put the remainder of the butter, 
onion, and sausage into the pan. Stir for 15 minutes. 
Remove from the fire, and stir in the yolk of egg and 
parsley. Have ready 6 pieces of white paper, cut into the 
shape of a heart, large enough to hold i chop each. Put i 
tablespoonful of the force-meat on one side of the paper ; lay 
the chop on this ; lay another tablespoonful of the mixture 
upon the chop, and fold the other half of the paper over this. 
The edges should then be folded together neatly and tightly, 
one over the other. Place them in a roasting-pan in the oven 
for 15 minutes. Serve in the papers, with a Bdchamel 
Sauce (see receipt). 

N. B. — The folding should be done very neatly and evenly ; 
the papillotes must all look exactly alike. Serve the sauce 
in a boat. 

Chops of any kind may be treated in the same way. 

BROWNED MUTTON CURRY. 

I pint of finely chopped cold mutton, I gill of rice,

frying-pan with the flour ; stir smooth, then add by degrees 
2 gills of boiling water ; stir smooth again. When boiling, 
add the meat, curry, and salt. Stir for lo-minutes. Heap 
the mixture in the centre of a fire-proof flat dish ; make a 
border of the rice around the meat, brush all over with 
beaten egg, and place in the oven until browned, from 5 to 
10 minutes.

If you have chops of whose tenderness you have doubts, 
this receipt is most useful and excellent. Use breast chops. 
They should be " frenched,"as the butchers say — that is, the 
bone stripped clean. Pound the chops with a heavy knife 
on both sides. Have the vegetables ready, fried in butter 
till slightly brown, and then simmered until half done Tvith 
a few tablespoonfuls of boiling water added to the pan, 
about 15 minutes. Take a saucepan (or bake -pan is better) 
which you can cover air-tight Lay the vegetables in the 
bottom. Sear the chops in the hot frying-pan only just long 
enough to slightly brown one side, then the other. Lay 
them on the bed of vegetables, and add just enough broth 
to cover them. Put the pan In the oven, tightly covered, 
for 30 minutes. Dish them in the centre of the dish in 
a circle with the vegetables around. Put the pan on the 
top of the range ; boil down the gravy rapidly for a few mo- 
ments ; strain it over the chops, and serve. If desired, the 
sauce may be thickened with a pinch of corn-starchy blended 
with a few drops of cold water. Boil 3 minutes, stirring 
constantly, and strain as above. Recommended.

MUTTON CROQUETTES. 

CROQUETTES DE MOUTON. 

Proceed exactly as for Corn-beef Croquettes (see receipt). 
Or, as follows : 

2 gills of mutton, chopped fine, 2 tablespoons of flour, 

2 " of macaroni, chopped, i tablespoon of butter, 

2 " of boiling milk, Curry-powder to taste, 

Salt and pepper, i tablespoon of chopped parsley. 

Make a sauce of the boiling milk, blended with the flour 
and butter. Stir, and let it boil until very thick. Add the 
curry, rubbed smooth. Have ready the mutton, etc. Do 
not chop the macaroni too fine. Mix all together, seasoning 
to taste. Set away to cool. Then roll as directed for 
Chicken Croquettes (see receipt), and fry in boiling lard 
(see General Directions for Frying). Rice may be substi- 
tuted for macaroni, if preferred. Excellent. 

CURRIED MUTTON. 

MOUTON AU KARI. 

Boil a shoulder of mutton whole until tender, adding 
to the water various seasonings, carrot, onion, etc. When 
perfectly tender (the length of cooking being dependent 
upon the age of the mutton), cut it into 2-inch dice. Rub 
together 2 tablespoonfuls each of flour and butter ; add to 
these I pint of the boiling broth in which the mutton was 
cooked. Stir. Boil 2 minutes. Add about i teaspoonful 
of curry-powder rubbed smooth with a little of the sauce, 
salt, and pepper. Put the meat into the sauce and simmer 
gently 1 5 minutes. Make a Rice Border (see receipt) ; dish 
the mutton curry in the centre; sprinkle chopped parsley 
over the top, and serve. A little lemon-juice may be added 
to the sauce, if liked. (Mashed potato may be substituted 
for the rice.) Excellent. The broth in which the mutton 
has. boiled will make good soup, with the addition of a little 
rice or barley.

Bunch of parsley, 2 " turnips, 

Salt, Pepper. 

Choose by preference the shoulder, which you can cut in 
pieces 3 inches square, being careful that the butcher does 
not splinter the bones. The next best is the " rack," with the 
meat cut in pieces at the joints. Put all together into an iron 
pot and stew very gently for about 2 hours. The really well- 
made Irish Stew is excellent, and for this the potatoes must 
be cooked until they begin to dissolve and thicken the gravy.- 
When done, dish it very carefully, as otherwise its appear- 
ance is unappetizing. Put the meat in the centre, the thick 
part of the vegetables around, and the sauce over all. If 
desired. Dumplings may be made (see receipts) and added to 
the boiling gravy when the meat has been removed. Cover 
and boil 12 minutes. Be careful that the gravy does not 
scorch, as it does easily under these circumstances.

MOUTON AU MACARONI. 

2 oz, of macaroni, i gill of milk, 

^ lb. of cold mutton, i teaspoon of curry-powder, 

\% oz. of butter, Salt to taste, 

2 eggs. 

Boil the macaroni in salted boiling water until just tender 
(about 20 minutes). Drain and set away to cool. Chop the 
cold meat ; mix with it i ounce of butter, the curry, salt, i 
beaten egg, and the milk. Cut the macaroni into ^inch bits 
and mix lightly with the mutton. Butter a pie-plate or sheet 
of tin and form the mixture into a neat, oval mass in the 
centre ; spread \ an ounce of butter over it and put it into 
the oven. When heated, cover it with a beaten egg seasoned 
with a pinch of salt and 2 of curry. Scatter crumbs over the

VEAL. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The best veal is very firm and pinkish white (" ashes of 
roses" describes the color exactly, if not too poetical for 
such a prosaic subject). Never buy that which has a bluish 
tinge. It should not be too young (less than 6 weeks) nor 
too old (over 6 months). The best season is from the 
middle of April until the first of July ; but it continues to 
be quite good until the end of October. From that to April 
1st it is not very good, being particularly stringy. Like all 
young meats, it spoils very quickly, and in summer must 
not be kept any longer than necessity demands, and not 
more than 2 or 3 days in cooler weather. In this country 
the utility of veal is not sufficiently recognized ; as a rule it 
is shockingly cooked, therefore indigestible ; hence its bad 
reputation. Whereas in reality it is no more indigestible 
than other young meats and far less so than pork, which, 
though not young meat, is also white. Young meats as a 
rule are not nutritious, but, if properly cooked, need not be 
particularly unwholesome ; lamb might be disapproved of on 
the same grounds, and yet it is very popular. If veal is 
sufficiently cooked, and cooked slowly, it will be found to be 
quite as safe for the average person as lamb. A very great 
improvement, and a practice to be strongly recommended, 
is to pound veal, not as you would pound beef, but almost 
to a pulp ; this makes it deliciously tender and quite digest- 
ible. It is indeed a most useful meat, furnishing an endless 
variety of dishes,

Trim the loin neatly ; turn the flap under and fasten with

Roasted, omitting the stuffing. Cover with a second pan 
and allow 20 minutes per pound in a slow oven. 

STUFFED FILLET OF VEAL ROASTED. 

ROUELLE DE VEAU FARCIE. 

Remove the bone from the fillet of veal. Fill the space 
with a Force-Meat or Dressing, (see receipts). An excellent 
dressing is made of equal quantities of stale bread-crumbs and 
chopped ham, chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of made 
mustard, and i egg. When the dressing is ready, fill the 
space left by the bone ; then skewer the fillet and tie it with 
tape or strips of muslin into a neat round. Sprinkle with 
pepper and salt. Tie a buttered paper over the top. Put 
it into a baking-pan, with a little sweet drippings or butter 
and very little boiling water. Let the fire be intensely hot 
at first ; then after 20 to 30 minutes slack it off to a very 
moderate heat. Baste very often. Just before it is done, 
remove the paper, dredge with flour ; dot with butter, and iet 
it brown. Allow about 18 minutes to the pound. If covered 
with thick paper or with another pan, and the fire is kept 
sufficiently moderate, you may allow 20 minutes to the 
pound, as veal must be very thoroughly done through. Add 
a little boiling water from time to time if necessary, but always 
very little at a time. When done, remove from the pan ; 
set the pan on top of the range ; add lemon-juice, pepper, 
salt, and, if necessary, some boiling water. Boil it down 
briskly ; skim ; strain some over the veal, and serve the rest 
in a sauce-boat.

BRAISED FILLET OF VEAL. 

ROUELLE DE VEAU BRAIS£e. 

Remove all the fibres and skin from the fillet ; lard the 
upper side with fine strips of salt porlc (see Roasted Filet 
of Beef Larded). The space left by removing the bone 
should be filled with force-meat as for Stuffed Fillet of 
Veal Roasted. Skewer it neatly into shape and tie it with 
tape or strips of muslin. Melt a large piece of butter in a 
stew-pan. Lay the veal in, turning it on all sides to brown 
evenly. When this is done, stand the larded side uppermost. 
Add 2\ gills of good stock, 2 gills of tomato-juice or tomato 
sauce, and i gill of sherry, salt and pepper. Cover and 
simmer gently, allowing about 20 minutes to the pound. 
When done, uncover and set the pan in the oven for about 
30 minutes to brown the meat, basting often to give a good 
color. Allow plenty of time ; cook gently, and the veal 
will be tender and perfectly digestible. Rapid and insuffi- 
cient cooking spoil veal and render it unwholesome. When 
cooked, dish. Strain and skim the gravy and serve in a 
boat.

FRICANDEA U OF VEAL. 

FRICANDEAU DE VEAU. 

The cut for this dish is taken from the thick side of the 
fillet, cut up and down, not across, including the round eye 
which forms the tenderest as well as the thickest part of the 
leg. This is the true fricandeau. Remove all skin and 



FRICANDEAU A LA SOUBISE. 135 

fibre, then with the rolling-pin pound the meat until almost 
as tender as pulp. Having done this well, form the meat 
into a neat round, loaf-like shape. Lard the side that is to 
stand uppermost (see Roasted Filet of Beef Larded). It 
will be found to be much more convenient to place the frican- 
deau on a perforated pie-dish which will fit into the braising- 
pot, as handling will deface it after its thorough pounding. 
When larded and ready, place the meat and pie-plate in the 
pot. Fry I onion and i carrot in butter ; add these to the 
pot with I bay-leaf, sprig of thyme, i clove, and a roux made 
of I tablespoonful of flour, stirred over the fire with i table- 
spoonful of butter until of a rich chestnut-brown. Blend 
this with just enough boiling water to make it smooth. Now 
add 3 gills of strong stock and i gill of sherry. Cover very 
closely and set over a sharp fire until it boils ; then draw aside 
where it will simmer gently without intermission. Allow 
about 20 minutes to the pound, if cooked slowly enough. 
The pot must be air-tight. About 30 minutes before it is to 
be served, uncover the pot, set it in the oven, and baste 
frequently until there forms a rich glaze over the top. This 
also improves the appearance of the larding. When ready, 
remove to a hot dish. Add a little broth to the pot ; stir 
and boil down rapidly for a few minutes. Strain and skim 
the gravy and serve it in a sauce-boat. Delicious.

BROWNED KNUCKLE OF VEAL. 

JARRET DE VEAU PAN£. 

Remove the lower bone from a boiled knuckle o\ veal ; 
lap the meat over neatly and skewer it. Beat the yalks of 
two raw eggs with half a teaspoonful of salt and a pinch of 
pepper ; cover the meat with this ; sprinkle with bread-crumbs 
and brown it in the oven. 

SAUCE : 

I oz. of butter. Rind of half a lemon and juice of same, 

I oz. of flour, j^ teaspoon of ground allspice, 

I pint of broth, Salt and cayenne. 

Brown the butter and flour together to a good color ; do 
not burn. Pour in the boiling broth by degrees, stirring all 
the time. Add seasonings and boil 5 minutes or more, if riot 
thick enough. Strain and serve in a sauce-boat with the veal. 
This is an economical dish, and very nice-looking as well as 
palatable. The veal must have boiled very slowly until very 
tender. The broth in which it was boiled will make a good 
soup. See receipts for White Soup, etc., etc. 

VEAL CUTLETS FRIED. 

NOIX DE VEAU PANNES. 

Veal cutlet, Bread-crumbs, 

Salt and pepper. Grated nutmeg, 

Lemon-juice, Egg and lard. 

With a knife remove the outer skin, all the sinews and 
fibres which you can manage to draw out of the cutlet. Cut 
it into pieces 3X3 inches. Beat the pieces to a pulp, lit- 
erally. Squeeze lemon-juice over them. Season the bread- 
crumbs with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Dip the cutlets into 
the egg, then shape them nicely into neat, even pieces, and 
dip them into the bread-crumbs, being careful that every part 
is covered. Set away on a dish for an hour or more if you 
have the time. Have ready boiling lard 2 inches deep. 
When ready, put the cutlets in a frying-basket ; plunge them 
into the lard and fry golden brown. (See General Direc- 



VEAZ CUTLETS BJtAISED. 1 37 

tions for Frying.) They will require about 12 to 15 minutes, 
and must cook a little more slowly after the first minute or 
two, drawing the frying-pan on one side. When gold color, 
remove them from the lard'; drain them on paper in the 
open mouth of the oven. When free from grease, dish 
neatly on a very hot dish and serve with Tomato Sauce, 
Brown Sauce, or Sauce Piquante, (see receipts). Done in 
this way, veal cutlets are almost as good as croquettes and 
quite as digestible.

sprinkle the veal, cut in pieces 3X3 inches, with salt and 
pepper ; lay it in the hot pan, turn quickly and sear both 
sides ; then draw it to the side of the range and let it cook 
slowly. It is done when it feels firm under the fork. It 
must be turned very often while cooking, that it may not 
harden on any one side. When done, lay the slices of veal 
in a circle on a hot dish alternately with the slices of pork. 
Pour nearly all the fat from the pan ; add to the pan the 
cream, in a little of which the flour has been mixed smooth. 
Simmer 3 minutes after it begins to boil. Pour it over the

Press them back into shape. Have the frying-pan heating 
on the fire. Lay in some slices of ham cut the same size as 
the veal. Let them fry a few minutes. Take them out and 
place on a warm dish. If there is not enough fat in the pan 
from the ham, add a lump of butter, and when bubbling, lay 
in the veal. Turn the pieces constantly and faithfully. 
When firm under the fork, they are done. Dish them in a

STUFFED FLANK OF VEAL (COLD). 

GALANTINE DE VEAU. 

Flank of veal, Sausage-meat, 

Bread-crumbs, Egg, 

Dice of tongue. Garlic, 

Bay-leaf, Thyme, pepper, and salt. 

Spread ojjt the flank, which you have had prepared and 
boned by the butcher. To be large enough, part of the 
breast has also to be included in cutting the flank, therefore 
the little flat bones and gristle must all be removed, as also 
all the sinews and fibres of the meat. Trim it evenly. 
Make a thick force-meat of sausage, half the bulk of same in 
bread-crumbs ; season to taste with pounded garlic (i clove 
of garlic or half teaspoonful of grated onion) ; salt and pep- 
per. A gill of wine or brandy will be found a great improve- 
ment. Add I or 2 eggs, according to the amount of 
force-meat required ; add dice of boiled tongue. Have 
ready a pot of boiling water, with i bay-leaf, sprig of thyme, 
and salt. When you have put the force-meat in the centre 
of the flank, roll it up very carefully, not to let the dressing 
escape at the ends. Tie it securely with strips of muslin or 
tape. Drop into the pot of boiling water, and boil hard for 1 5 
minutes, covered ; then set to one side, and boil more gently 
for 45 minutes, or longer if the meat is thick. When done, 
set the pot aside until all is cold before removing the roll. 
This is excellent sliced thiri for luncheon, and keeps several 
days. 

BLANQUETTE OF VEAL. 
BLANQUETTE DE VEAU. 

There are two ways of preparing this dish, one simple, the 
other more complex : both are given. It is unnecessary to 



CREAM OF VEAL. 14I 

say that the more elaborate is the better of the two ; but the 
simple one is excellent. 

Cut a breast of veal (the thin, gristly part also) into pieces 
2x3 inches. Lay them in a bowl of vinegar and water for 
about I hour. This will draw out the blood. Then proceed 
exactly as for Fricasseed Chicken (see receipt). When 
cooked very tender (it must only simmer), about i hour and 
30 minutes, more or less, remove the veal. Strain the gravy ; 
make a White Roux as directed (see receipt) ; stir in the boil- 
ing broth ; when thickened to the proper consistency^ add 
lemon-juice, nutmeg, salt, and a dash of cayenne. Put the 
veal into the sauce ; set it over boiling water, and let it stew 
very gently for about 30 minutes at the back of the range. 
Dish the meat neatly. Bring the sauce to a boil. Have 
ready in a bowl 2 yolks of eggs (to a pint of sauce), beaten 
with a gill of cream. Pour some of the sauce very gently 
upon them. Remove the sauce from the fire ; stir the eggs 
thus prepared into the boiling sauce ; pour the whole over 
the blanquette; garnish with large crofitons, sliced lemon, 
and parsley. Serve. Excellent. 

Or, slice some cold roast fillet of veal, about a third of an 
inch thick, in even neat pieces, cutting off all the outer 
brown skin. Prepare a Sauce Blonde or Velout^. When it 
is hot, lay in the veal ; set over boiling water for 30 mihutes, 
where it will barely simmer. Season with lemon-juice, nut- 
meg, and a dash of cayenne. Garnish as above, and serve. 
Very good, and much less trouble than the first receipt. 



CREA^M OF VEAL. 

cr6me de veau. 

Make 2 gills of Cream Sauce (see receipt). Chop 3 parts 
veal and i part ham, very fine ; stir in enough to thicken the 
sauce, so that it will no longer pour. Season the veal with 
a dash of nutmeg and cayenne. Serve on toast. Chicken 
may be prepared in the same way ; also mutton, to which 
should be added a pinch of curry-powder.

CREOLE RA TA TOUILLE. 

RATATOUILLE A LA CREOLE. 

3 pounds of lean veal, 2 cloves of garlic, 

\ pound ham, cut in i-in. dice, 2 onions, sliced. 

Sprig of thyme, Veal bones for gravy, 

I can of tomatoes, or 6 or 8 freSh, 4 or 6 sweet potatoes, 

I can of okra, or 50 fresh, Salt, pepper, and cayenne. 

First of all make your gravy as follows : Brown the bones 
and trimmings of the veal, and any chicken bones which you 
may have, in butter in a frying-pan ; or you may roast them 
till brown in the oven. When well browned, put them in a 
saucepap on the fire with the garlic, thyme, tomatoes, and a 
little dash of boiling water (according to the amount of 
liquor there is on the tomatoes). As you will require about 
I quart of gravy, it is best to begin with 3 pints of liquid. 
Fry the onions brown in butter, and add them to the sauce- 
pan. Cover. Let the whole stew very gently on the side 
of the range for 2 hours, or longer, until the gravy is tasty 
and strong. Then strain it and return it to the saucepan. 
Have your veal cut in pieces about the length of i finger and 
breadth of 2. Fry the pieces in butter until nicely browned, 
turning often to avoid toughening ; put these in the sauce- 
pan ; add the dice of ham, the sweet potatoes cut in cubes 
of about \^ inches, salt, and pepper. Add also, if avail- 
able, half a sweet-pepper without seeds. Stew all togethei 
gently until the veal is thoroughly tender and the sweet 
potatoes are on the point of melting away, which will be 
from i^ to 2 hours. Ten minutes before this point is reached, 
add the can of okra. If you use fresh okras, select small 
ones, tip and tail them, and add to the stew 30 minutes be- 
fore removing from the fire. When it is all done, dish th« 
meat in the centre of a platter, the sweet potatoes around 
the edge, the okra over the meat. Let the gravy boil down 
rapidly for a few minutes ; add salt and cayenne to taste ; il 
not thick enough, stir in i teaspoonful of corn-starch dissolved 
in a little cold water. Boil 3 minutes and pour over the 
stew. This is a delicious dish, and perfectly easy to make, 
although it may appear complicated.

Cold ham, chopped, Bread-crumbs, 

Parsley, chopped Grated onion, 

I egg. Pepper and salt, 

Lemon-juice, Nutmeg, 

Butter, Spanish olives, stoned. 

Having removed the skin and fibres from the flank of veal 
and wiped it clean, cut it in neat strips about 2 inches wide 
by 4 inches long. Pound carefully with a few strokes. Mix 
together all the other ingredients, except the olives and 
butter, using cold ham and cold veal in equal proportions 
and bread-crumbs equal to the bulk of these two. Put a 
layer of dressing in the centre of each strip of veal, roll 
neatly, arid tie so that the mince will not run out. The ends 
can be pinned over with small wooden skewers, in which 
case be very careful to remove them before serving. Melt a 
tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan. When it bubbles, 
lay in the rolls and turn them until evenly browned all over. 
Add enough stock to half-cover them ; close tightly, and set 
on a corner of the range to simmer gently for 30 to 40 
minutes. Then remove them to a hot dish ; bring the gravy, 
strained, to a boil ; thicken it with corn-starch blended with 
cold water. Stir and boil 3 minutes. Add a few stoned 
olives, pepper, and salt. Pour over the rolls and serve. 
This is a very old-fashioned dish.

I tablespoon of chopped parsley, 3 yolks of eggs, beaten light, 

I cup grated bread-crumbs, dry and fine, i egg for glazing. 

Mix half of the gravy and all the other ingredients, except 
the egg for glazing. Add the yolks of the eggs last. The

mixture should be just firm enough to hold in shape when, 
moulded into a loaf. If it is too soft, add bread-crumbs. 
Flour your hands and mould it into a loaf rather more than 
twice its breadth in length. If longer, it will crack in dishing. 
Flour the outside well, and place it in a greased pan large 
enough to permit of your handling the loaf without danger 
of disfiguring it. Cover over and set in the oven until 
smoking hot. Remove the cover and allow it to brown 
quickly. Draw it to the oven-door and brush over with 
beaten egg. Shut the door and leave for 3 minutes, or until 
nicely brown. It will require in all about i hour in a mod- 
erate oven. If cooked in too hot an oven, the loaf will 
crack. When done, transfer it by means of a cake-turner to 
a hot dish. Handle it very carefully. Serve it with the 
remaining half-cup of brown gravy, or with Tomato Sauce, 
or Mushroom Sauce (see receipts). It is delicious served 
cold with salad.

SWEETBREADS. 

TO PREPARE SWEETBREADS. 

First soak in clear, cold water and vinegar for an hour to 
draw out the blood. Then put into fresh cold water ; add 
salt ; heat very gradually and boil for 20 minutes. Drain 
and throw again into cold water. When thoroughly cold, 
remove all the veins, strings, and fibres that you can de- 
tach without breaking the sweetbreads into pieces. They 
are now ready to be dressed according to any of the follow- 
ing receipts. 

FRIED SWEETBREADS. 

RIS DE VEAU PAN^S. 

Having prepared the sweetbreads as directed, cut them in 
even-sized cubes or slices no less than i inch thick, or they 
may be left whole ; dip first in fine sifted bread- or cracker- 
crumbs, then in white of egg, then again in the crumbs. Do 
this at least an hour before dinner, and set in the ice-box. 
When required, have lard at least i^ inches deep boiling on 
the fire. Use a frying-basket if possible. Lay in the pieces 
of sweetbread. The lard should cover them. In about 4 
minutes, if golden brown, drain them out and lay on brown 
paper in the open oven door until dry (see General Di- 
rections for Frying). Dish in a circle on cut paper or a 
foMed napkin, garnished around with cut lemon ; put in the 
centre a large bunch of Fried Parsley (see receipt). Serve in 
a sauce-boat at the same time, Tomato Sauce, Tartare, 
Poivrade, etc. (see receipts). 

N. B. — Never serve the sauce on the same dish with fried 
sweetbreads, or indeed with any thing fried, as the moisture 
of the sauce will mar the perfection of the frying by making 
the article so cooked soggy, limp, and tough. Sauted sweet- 
breads, etc., should, on the contrary, be invariably served with 
a sauce or pur6e of some sort on the dish.

Having prepared the sweetbreads as first directed, cut them 
in slices ^ an inch thick ; sprinkle with pepper, salt, and a 
little grated nutmeg, some finely-chopped parsley, and lemon-

at least i J inches deep, boiling in a kettle on the fire. Drop 
in the slices of sweetbread and fry 2 or 3 minutes, until light 
golden brown (see General Directions for Frying). When 
the fritters are sufficiently cooked, skim them out, and 
drain on brown paper in the mouth of the oven. Place upon 
ihe dish in a circle on cut paper or a folded napkin, and serve 
with Tartare or Tomato Sauce (see receipts) in a boat. 

SWEETBREADS BRAISED AND LARDED. 

RIS DE VEAU PIQU:fiS ET BRAISES. 

6 sweetbreads, Salt pork for larding, 

6 slices of bacon, I chopped onion, 

I bay-leaf, 3 cloves, 

6 allspice, I clove of garlic, 

Pepper and salt. Strips of ham, 

I gill of sheity, i teaspoon of butter. 

Consomme, i teaspoon of flour. 

Do not parboil the sweetbreads for this mode of cooking. 
Soak them for i hour in cold water and vinegar. Remove 
the veins and cords, but keep the sweetbreads whole. Lard 
the side which is to stand uppermost. Lay the thin slices of 
bacon in the bottom of a hot stewpan which will fit in the 
oven. On these lay the sweetbreads, larding uppermost; 
add onion, bay-leaf, spices, garlic, pepper, salt, and a few 
strips of ham ; add i gill of sherry or madeira, and only just 
enough strong consomm6 to cover the sweetbreads f or even 
less. Cover air-tight to keep in all the steam, and stew very 
gently from 30 to 45 minutes, according to the size of the 
sweetbreads. Melt the butter in a frying-pan and stir the 



148 GOOD.LIVING. 

flour with it until well browned but not burnt. Stir into it a 
little of the sauce. Add it to the saucepan and boil for a 
few minutes to thicken. Fifteen minutes before serving, un- 
cover ; set the pan in the oven and baste frequently. This 
will glaze the surface and improve the appearance of the 
larding. Now take out the sweetbreads and pieces of ham 
and place them neatly on a hot dish. If the gravy is not 
rich enough, boil it rapidly for a few minutes. Add season- 
ing if required, and a little more wine. If not thick enough, 
a little corn-starch blended with a few drops of cold water, 
may be added and boiled 3 minutes. Mushrooms should be 
added to the sauce after straining it (although not obliga- 
tory). Pour some over the sweetbreads and serve the rest 
in a boat. This is beyond question the best of the many 
ways of cooking sweetbreads. Green peas should be served 
at the same time. 

SWEETBREADS SAUT&. , 

RIS DE VEAU SAUTES. 

Having prepared the sweetbreads as first directed, cut 
them in even slices about i inch thick; have some butter 
melted in a frying-pan and lay in the slices of sweetbread, 
turning until browned very slightly on both sides. Do not 
let the butter burn. Leave them in the pan only just long 
enough to heat through thoroughly and brown slightly ; then 
dish in a circle on a bed of vegetable pur^e of some sort, 
and always with a sauce. Sweetbreads saut^ may be served 
with:

4 eggs, yolks only. Salt and pepper, 

Lemon-juice, Parsley. 

Having prepared the sweetbreads as directed in the first 
receipt, cut them in pieces the size of a walnut. To make 
the sauce, stir the flour and butter together over the fire, but 
do not brown ; when blended, pour in by degrees, stirring 
unremittingly, enough boiling water to thin the sauce to the 
consistency of very thick cream, almost as thick as batter ; 
add seasonings and lemon-juice. Now put in the sweet- 
breads, and when heated through (they will not require boil- 
ing) add in the cream which you have brought to boiling 
point in another saucepan. Then remove from the fire ; stir 
in a small lump of fresh butter and the beaten yolks of eggs. 
Stir briskly not to curdle. Sprinkle finely-chopped parsley 
over and serve. 

N. B. — To prevent the yolks from curdling, they should be 
broken into a bowl and beaten until smooth with a table- 
spoonful of the cold cream ; then take a little of the hot 
gravy, a spoonful at a time, and mix it in the bowl with the 
eggs ; when smooth turn the eggs into the hot sauce, and stir 
quickly. Do not boil again after the eggs are in, but set 
over a kettle of boiling water {bain-marie) to keep hot if it has 
to stand at all. A great improvement upon the above con 
ventional dish is 

SWEETBREADS WITH MUSHROOMS. 

RIS DE VEAU AUX CHAMPIGNONS. 

To the above, add fresh or canned mushrooms and i gill of 
sherry, before the eggs are added. Stew 5 minutes, then finish 
as above.

CURRIED SWEETBREADS. 

RIS DE VEAU AU KARI. 

Prepare as directed A la Poulette, adding powdered curry 
to taste, carefully blended and mixed with the sauce before 
the eggs are added ; or the eggs may be omitted entirely. 
Curried sweetbreads should be served with a Rice Border 
(see receipt). 

BROILED SWEETBREADS. 

RIS DE VEAU GRIJ.L:£S. 

Having prepared the sweetbreads as described in first 
receipt, heat the gridiron very hot over or under a clear fire. 
Roll the sweetbreads in melted butter and place on the grid- 
iron. Turn often, taking them off once or twice to dip again 
in melted butter and return to the gridiron. When well col- 
ored, season with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon- 
juice. They should be eaten very hot. Serve with or with- 
out other sauce than the melted butter. Excellent. 

ROASTED SWEETBREADS. 
RIS DE VEAU r6tIS. 

Having prepared as directed in first receipt, dip whole as 
for frying. When dipped, lay them in a roasting-pan with a 
few spoonfuls of strong consomm^. Baste frequently, and 
when nicely browned, serve. They will not require more than 
about 20 minutes. You may lay slices of bacon in the pan 
under each sweetbread. 

Or, prepare as for Braised Sweetbreads, larding or not as 
you prefer. Then put them in the pan with the seasonings. 
Cover the first pan with another. Bake until about half 
cooked (20 to 25 minutes), then remove the top pan, baste 
very frequently with wine and consomm6, using less con- 
somme than directed for braising. When brown and firm, 
dish. They will require in all from 45 minutes to i hour, in 
a moderate oven. Boil the gravy rapidly a few minutes, after

removing the sweetbreads ; thicken slightly with a little corn- 
starch blended in cold water. Boil 3 minutes. Strain and 
pour over the sweetbreads. Serve. 

SWEETBREADS EN CASSEROLES. 

RIS DE VEAU EN CASSEROLES. 

Prepare as first directed ; then cut in dice and proceed as 
in receipt for Sweetbreads with Mushrooms, adding almost 
an equal quantity of oysters from which the muscles have been 
removed ; use a generous proportion of mushrooms, more 
wine, and a pinch of curry-powder (not enough to be percep- 
tible) in the sauce, also a dash of celery-scilt. 

N. B. — The oysters should be scalded until firm in their own 
juice, before adding to the sauce. The eggs may be omitted 
if rich cream is used. The above receipt used as a filling for 
p4t6s of fine puff-paste, vol-au-vent, or served in casseroles or 
cases will be found most delicious. 

SWEETBREAD CROQUETTES. 

CROQUETTES DE RIS DE VEAU. 

I pair of sweetbreads, parboiled, % teaspoon of grated nutmeg, 

I gill of cream or rich milk, i tablespoon of butter, 

5 drops of onion-juice, 2 tablespoons of flour, 

}i teaspoon of white pepper, 2 tablespoons of chopped mushrooms. 

Bread-crumbs, eggs, and lard, i tablespoon of chopped parsley. 

Trim the sweetbreads and chop, not too fine, using a silver 
knife. Bring the cream to a boil. Rub the butter and flour 
together over the fire ; add cream ; stir smooth ; boil until 
very thick, stirring constantly. Remove from the fire ; add 
sweetbreads, seasonings, and mushrooms. Mix. Turn out 
on a dish to cool. When cold and firm, have a plate of flour, 
a plate with a beaten egg (or the whites alone), and a bowl 
of fine sifted bread-crumbs. Flour your hands ; take about 
atablespoonful of the mixture, quickly form it into shape (the

easiest is cylindrical, i x 2J inches) ; dip this deftly into 
the egg, then drop it into the bowl of crumbs and cover 
it all over. Shape it again carefully and lay on a flat dish. 
The croquettes should not touch, that the air may reach 
all sides. There is a great knack in this part of making cro- 
quettes of any kind. The best teacher of all is experience ; 
after a little while it will seem quite easy to handle them. 
Set away in the ice-box for 2 or 3 hours. Have lard boiling 
in a saucepan deep enough to cover the croquettes com- 
pletely. Put them in a frying-basket and plunge them into 
the boiling lard (see General Directions for Frying). When 
fried golden brown, drain on paper in the mouth of the 
oven ; dish on a cut paper or folded napkin tastefully gar- 
nished, and serve at the same time green peas.

Having prepared the sweetbreads as directed in iirst 
receipt, dip them in egg and fine, sifted bread-crumbs. Set 
aside i hour. Heat i tablespoonful of butter in a frying- 
pan ; when bubbling, lay in the sweetbreads. Brown one 
side, then the other. Dish the sweetbreads. Strain the 
butter into a clean pan. Add the onion, cream, pepper, 
salt, and i extra teaspoonful of butter, and boil for 3 
minutes. Now blend the flour with a little cold water. 
Stir this into the boiling sauce. Boil 3 minutes, or until 
thick enough. Add parsley. Pour the sauce over the 
sweetbreads. Serve immediately. 



CALF'S HEAD AU GRATIN. 153 

CALFS HEAD BOILED. 

t£te de veau au naturel. 

Wash the head (which should already be prepared free 
from hair ai>d bleached). Be very careful to thoroughly 
cleanse the ears inside. Singe off any little downy hairs that 
may remain. Pour boiling water through the throat and 
nose passages. Put the head into a large kettle of cold 
water. Bring it gradually to a boil and skim well. When it 
has boiled 2 hours take it out, remove the eyes, which throw 
away ; remove the tongue and skin it. Return the head to 
the kettle. Add salt, pepper, i gill of vinegar, a large bunch 
of sweet herbs, spices, and i clove of garlic. Simmer 2 hours 
longer, making 4 hours in all. It is now ready to serve Au 
Naturel, or dressed according to any of the following receipts. 
If it is to be served whole, boiled, it is advisable, when yoq 
take it out after the first 2 hours, to rub it all over with 
lemon-juice and tie it up in a clean, floured cloth. It will 
then be whiter. Serve plain boiled calf's head with Mattre 
d*H6tel or Poivrade Sauce (see receipts). 

CALF'S HEAD A U GRA TIN. 

TETE DE VEAU AU GRATIN. 

Having boiled the calf's head as directed (see receipt), cut 
off the meat from each side' of the head, keeping it in 2 
large pieces. Lay these neatly in a fire-proof dish. Pour 
over it a mixture of melted butter, much lemon-juice, a 
little French mustard, pepper, and salt. Tuck the ears under 
so as to leave a smooth surface. Cover this with a beaten 
egg, then with bread-crumbs and chopped pafsley ; place in 
the oven until nicely browned, about 25 minutes. There 
should be only butter, etc., enough to moisten and flavor the 
meat ; not enough to make a liquid sauce around it. The 
brains, after being prepared as directed (see To Prepare 
Calf's Brains), may be divided into pieces, dipped in batter 
or egg and bread-crumbs, fried in boiling lard, and served at 
the same time as a garnish.

meat, tongue, and the brains (which have been previously pre- 
pared) upon a hot dish and keep warm while the sauce is 
being made.

I lb. of sausage meat, zo whole cloves. 

Mace, cloves, allspice, ground, 20 " alUpice, 

I slice of cold ham. 

Wash the head, carefully -cleansing the ears, and scalding 
nose and throat passages. Put it into a large soup-kettle with 
sufficient cold water to cover it. Add the salt. Bring it 
slowly to a boil and boil about two hours. Then remove the 
eyes and throw them away. Also remove the tongue, which 
should be tender enough by this time. Put it away until 
required. (Skin it before using.) Return the rest of the head 
to the fire, adding the carrots, onions, and 2 cloves of garlic. 
Let it boil until the bones slip out easily ; about 3 J hours 
in all, after it once breaks into a boil. Take out the 



CALF'S HEAD ^ LA TERRAPIN. 155 

head and remove all the bones and any of the cartilage 
that is too hard to put into the cheese. Put the large bones 
back into the soup-kettle and let it all boil down for soup. 
Put the smaller pieces into a saucepan with about i quart of 
the liquor in which the head was boiled. Add 2 cloves of 
garlic, 10 cloves, 20 allspice, and let it boil rapidly with the 
cover off while you prepare the meat. Chop the meat of 
the head into rather large pieces ; mix with it the bread- 
crumbs, sausage-meat, vinegar, salt, cayenne, and black pep- 
per ; then add ground mace, cloves, and allspice to taste, also 
the powdered herbs ; about l teaspoonful each of the latter ; 
it must be tasted and seasoned according to requirements. 
Now make the niixture quite soft (as soft as batter) by 
straining into it some of the liquor that has been boiling 
down in the saucepan. When well mixed and soft, put the 
mixture into a saucepan and set it over the fire, stirring con- 
stantly to prevent scorching. Be most careful not to allow 
it to scorch. Stir until it has boiled at least 3 minutes. 
Rinse out with cold water tins the shape of a loaf ; pour the 
mixture into them, putting first a layer of this, then a few 
larger pieces of tongue and some strips of cold boiled ham. 
Fill with the mixture and set away to harden for at least 6 
hours. When cut in slices, the addition of the ham will 
make it prettily marbled. Eat for breakfast or luncheon. 
This is excellent, and less trouble than it seems. 

CALF'S HEAD A LA TERRAPIN.

Having boiled a calf's head (see receipt), cut the meat in 
pieces from the cheek about i inch square. Make a Terra- 
pin Sauce (see receipt) ; stir the calf's head into this sauce. 
It is best made early and stood away for some hours before 
dinner. The hard-boiled whites of the eggs may be sliced 
and stirred in with the meat. When required, place the 
bowl over a kettle of boiling water {bain-marie) for 30 or 45 
minutes, where it will heat without cooking. Serve it in a 
casserole or deep dish. Delicious.

TO PREPARE CALVES' BRAINS FOR COOKING, 

Wash first in clear, cold water. Throw this off. Cover 
again with cold water, a tablespoonful of vinegar, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Let them soak from 20 to 30 minutes. 
Have ready on the fire a saucepan of salted boiling water ; 
lay in the brains ; let them remain until firm, about 15 min- 
utes, then drain and plunge again into cold water. This 
process whitens them. When cold, draw off all the fibres 
that you can without breaking them into pieces. After this, 
they are ready to dress according to any of the following re- 
ceipts. 

CALVES' BRAINS FRIED. 

CERVELLES DE VEAU FRITES. 

Prepare as above ; dip first in bread-crumbs, then in egg,

lemon-juice, or nutmeg if preferred. Divide in small, even 



CALVES' BRAINS iVITH MACARONI. Ig/ 

pieces not less than i x i inch. Dip in very thick batter (see 
batter for Clam Fritters). Bring the lard to a boil (see General 
Directions for Frying). Too great stress cannot be laid 
upon this essential for successful frying. Let it be deep 
enough to cook the brains without their touching the bot- 
tom of the pan, that they may puff equally on all sides. 
Turn them to brown evenly. When golden brown, skim out 
and lay upon paper in the mouth of the oven. When dry, 
serve on a folded napkin or cut paper ; garnish with a bunch 
of Fried Parsley (see receipt). Serve with Mayonnaise, To- 
mato, or Tartare Sauce (see receipts).

sides. Remove to a hot dish. If the butter has been ab- 
sorbed too much, add another spoonful and let it fry until 
quite dark brown, then add 2 to 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar 
according to the quantity of sauce required. Add pepper 
and salt. Boil up once and pour over the fried brains. The 
sauce should taste very strong of vinegar. This is one of 
the most acceptable ways of cooking calves' brains.

LIVER AND BACON. 

Liver, Bacon, 

Flour, Pepper and salt. 

Cut calf's liver in slices fully \ an inch thick ; throw boiling 
water over and let stand for 5 minutes. Wipe dry. Coat 
thickly with flour. Have ready a frying-pan with the strips 
of bacon cut thin. Fry 3 minutes. If necessary, add a lit- 
tle lard if the bacon does not yield enough fat. When very 
hot, drop in the slices of liver, fry a few minutes one side, 
then turn and fry the other. When well browned, pour in 
boiling water sufficient to half-cover the liver. Season. 
Cover tightly and set back where it will simmer gently for 
20 to 30 minutes. Then remove the liver to a hot dish with 
the bacon ; set the frying-pan over the fire, boil briskly and 
stir. If it has steamed off too much, add a few spoon- 
fuls of boiling water, boil, stir, and pour over the liver. This 
is no more difficult than the coarsest and commonest way of 
cooking liver, and makes of that article of food a tasty dish, 
instead of what is generally set before one under the name 
of liver and bacon — " chips and grease " might be a more 
appropriate term. An onion cut fine and fried first with the 
bacon, is a great addition, according to taste. 

CALF'S LIVER BRAISED.

Tie the liver in a neat roll. If you cannot procure i large 
one, take 2 smaller. If nicely tied up they look like a pair 
of ducks when served. Fry the onions and carrots in but- 
ter. Have an iron pot well heated. Lay in the slices of 
bacon and fry for a few minutes ; when the fat is melted out, 



MOCK TERRAPIN. 1 59 

lay in the liver, turning it to sear on all sides. Do not sear 
it too long or it will harden the skin. When ready, turn in 
the fried vegetables ; add all other vegetables and seasonings 
and enough boiling water or stock to half-cover the liver. 
Lay a little more bacon over the liver. Close the pot 
air-tight. Bring to a rapid boil, then set away where it 
will only simmer for about 2 hours. When the liver is per- 
fectly cooked and firm to the touch, remove it to a hot dish. 
Bring the gravy to a rapid boil ; add to it a roux made of 
I teaspoonful of butter and a heaping teaspoonful of flour 
stirred together over the fire until brown, then blended with 
a little of the boiling sauce. After adding this to the pot, 
stir and let the gravy boil briskly for 5 minutes. Strain it. 
Put the vegetables around the liver ; pour some of the 
sauce over the liver and serve the rest in a sauce-boat. A 
little wine may be added to the sauce, but is not indispensa- 
ble. Recommended. 

ROASTED LIVER. 
FOIE DE VEAU r6tI, 

Prepare as above. Cut the vegetables fine and put a layer 
of them in the bottom of the pan. Cover the liver with 
bread-crumbs ; over this lay thin strips of bacon. Lay the 
liver on the vegetables. Roast slowly for about 2 hours, 
basting frequently with good stock or boiling water. Thicken 
the sauce as above directed. Liver may also be roasted 
without the bed of vegetables, but is not as tasty. 

N. B. — The liver should be covered with a second pan to 
prevent the surface from hardening.

slices and let stand $ minutes before draining it off, cooking 
as above.

Have the butter very hot in a frypan. Lay the slices in, 
turning first one side, then the other until cooked firm. 
Place neatly on a hot dish. Squeeze lemon-juice and sprinkle 
parsley over the top. Add the butter in which the liver was 
cooked, also a little wine, and serve. The gravy can be 
slightly thickened if preferred. 

N.B. — Beef's liver should be cut in slices, and boiling water 
poured over it allowing it to stand 5 minutes before cooking. 
Wipe the slices dry and cook according to any of the above 
receipts. 

LIVER SMOTHERED IN ONIONS.

Cut the liver in small, neat slices. Melt lard \ an inch 
deep in the frying-pan. Heat by degrees until smoking hot. 



FOURCHETTE. l6l 

While the larcl is heating, make the sauce as follows : Brown 
the butter and flour together over the fire, and when it is a 
good color, but not burned, stir in slowly the boiling water, 
blending perfectly smooth. Boil 3 minutes. Add salt and 
pepper and a heaping tablespoonful of capers or chopped 
pickles. Set the saucepan on one side of the fire, where it 
will keep hot without cooking. Now put the parsley and 
onion into the lard and let it cook 2 minutes, then lay the 
sliced liver in the lard and turn constantly until slightly 
browned on both sides. It is cooked when it is firm under 
the pressure of the fork. As it finishes, lay each piece in the 
sauce, covering it all over. When all is cooked, dish the 
pieces in a circle and pour the sauce over all. This is much 
better than the ordinary way of frying it. 

BROILED LIVER. 

FOIE DE VEAU GR1LL£. 

Cut the liver in thin slices ; lay it in salted cold water for 30 
minutes, then wipe dry; lay the slices on a hot greased 
broiler, turning often and basting with melted butter. This 
should be done on a gridiron under the fire, and all the gravy 
should be collected in a trough or pan at the bottom ; pour 
this over the liver. Season with pepper and salt and serve. 

FOURCHETTE. 

Take slices of salt pork about \ of an Jnch thick and 2 or 3 
inches square ; also slices of calf's liver the same size. Put 
these alternatively on a long skewer beginning and ending 
with pork. Lay it in the oven across a dripping-pan and 
roast it as you would a bird, basting occasionally with a little 
boiling water from the roasting-pan. It will take 1 5 to 20 
minutes. The liver is done when firm to the touch, and the 
pork should be transparent. When cooked, draw out the 
skewer and serve in alternate slices of pork and liver. If you 
use silver or plated skewers, serve without removing.

TO PREPARE TRIPE. 

Wash it in 3 or 4 waters until perfectly clean. It is always 
bleached before it comes from market. In former times such 
was not the case, and it was necessary to take much more 
trouble in its preparation. When thoroughly clean, put it 
into a kettle with cold water, salt, and i tablespoonful of 
vinegar, and bring it to a boil. Add a couple of onions. 
Stand the kettle where the tripe will simmer gently for fully 
5 hours, until it is so tender that you can easily pierce it 
through. Drain thoroughly, and it is now ready to be 
dressed according to any of the following receipts. 

FRIED TRIPE. 
TRIPE FRITE. 

Having prepared the tripe as above, cut it in strips about 
I inch wide by 3 long. Coat it first with egg, then with 
bread-crumbs and drop it into boiling lard (see General

onions cooked in plain boiling water until perfectly tender. 
Add these to the Poulette Sauce and let them stew while 
you cut the tripe in neat pieces, diamond-shaped, square, or 
long. Add the tripe to the sauce ; stew the whole gently 
over boiling water (bain-marie) for 30 minutes. Note. — Do 
not under any circumstances add the egg-yolks to a Poulette 
Sauce until just ready to serve. If the sauce is boiled after 
they are in, it will curdle. Season with parsley, pepper, salt, 
and lemon-juice, and serve. 

CALVES' KIDNEYS.

These are very delicate ; far better than either beef or 
lamb kidneys. Prepare according to any of the receipts 
given for these latter. 

STUFFED CALF'S HEART. 

CCEUR DE VEAU FARCI. 

Wash off, but do not soak. Stuff with a Turkey or Veal 
Dressing (see receipts), highly seasoned. Tie a buttered 
paper over the open end and bake in a small pan with pepper, 
salt, and a little boiling water. Bake 2 hours, basting often. 
When nearly done, remove the paper and let the top brown ; 
blend a little corn-starch with cold water, stir it into the boil- 
ing gravy; boil 3 minutes, strain, skim, season, and pour it 
over the heart. Garnish with onions that have been first 
boiled, then sprinkled with salt, pepper, and sugar, and 
browned in the oven.

3 teaspoons of chopped sage, 2 ounces of butter, 
}i saltspoon of pepper, i saltspoon of salt, 

4 times the bulk of onions in bread-crumbs, i egg. 

The pig should be well cleaned, skinned, and washed. 
Make a dressing of the above ingredients ; fill the pig with 
it, and sew up with strong thread, trussing the front legs 
forward, the hind legs up against the body as if lying down. 
Put a clean bit of wood between the jaws to keep them 
slightly open. Rub the pig all over with butter, pepper, and 
salt, then dredge with flour. Put in a pan in the oven ; in 
the pan put a very little boiling water. The heat should ilot 
be too intense at first. It must cook slowly. . Baste very 
frequently, especially as it comes near being done. When 
cooked (in about 3 hours), remove the bit of wood and re- 
place it by the classic corn cob, or by a small red apple. 
Serve with Apple Sauce (see receipt). Eat, and imagine, if 
you can, that the shade of Charles Lamb is hovering over 
you. The dressing indicated may be replaced by plain 
mashed potatoes, or by a force-meat of veal, etc. (see re- 
ceipts for Force-meats).

with a sharp penknife in close lines down and across. This 
latter will make what old-fashioned people call the " Crack- 
lin'," and is very nutty. Rub the loin all over with pow- 
dered sage. Put it into a very moderate oven, with very 
little boiling water in the pan. Pork must always cook 
slowly and long. Allow fully 20 minutes to the pound in a 
mode'rate oven. Baste frequently, and when done, serve 
with Apple Sauce (see receipt). 

BROILED PORK CHOPS WITH PICKLE SA UCE. 

c6telettes de porc grillees aux cornichons. 

Use the rib chops. Clean off the handles ; dip first in 
melted butter, then in bread-crumbs, and broil over a, clear 
fire. Sauce for the same : 

4 tablespoons of vinegar, i tablespoon of chopped pickles or capers, 

8 or 10 tablespoons of stock, Pepper, 

Corn-starch, Salt. 

Boil the vinegar and stock together ; while boiling, stir in 
just enough corn-starch blended with a little cold stock to 
make the sauce as thick as cream. Stir quickly and boil 3 
minutes. Add pepper, salt, and chopped pickles or capers, 
and pour over* the chops, which have been dished in a circle, 
with a frill on each chop handle. Serve. 

PORK TENDERLOINS. 
FILETS DE PORC SAUTlSs. 

Split the tenderloins lengthwise, but do not separate the 
two halves. Spread them open ; rub all over with powdered 
sage ; sprinkle with pepper and salt. Have ready a very hot 
frying-pan with a teaspoonful of butter or sweet drippings 
melted in it. Lay in the tenderloins. In about i minute 
turn them. Do not leave them long on any one side. Saut6 
them until slightly browned and quite firm under pressure 
of the fork. They must be thoroughly cooked through, as 
pork should always be eaten well done. Serve with Apple 
Sauce (see receipt) or with grape or currant jelly. 



l66 GOOD-LTVING. 

PORK AND BEANS. 

I quart of white beans, I large onion, cut fine, 

}4 pound of salt pork cat in strips. Pepper and salt, 

I tablespoon of molasses. Cold water to cover. 

Put all but the molasses in a pot. Stand for an hour or 
more at the side of the range to heat slowly. If the beans 
can be soaked overnight, then they may be brought to a 
boil more quickly and will take much less time to cook. 
Boil very slowly. It is advisable, when boiling, to throw in 
a gill of cold water from time to time. This makes the 
hearts of the beans cook more evenly with the outsides. 
When boiled perfectly tender, which will be from 3 to 6 
hours, according to whether or not the beans have been pre- 
viously soaked, drain off the liquor into a bowl ; put the 
beans into a bake-dish with the molasses, and fill to their 
level with the liquor of the beans ; bake in a very slow oven 
for about 2 hours. The top should be nicely browned, but 
not too dark, and the beans soft and creamy all through. 
For Boston Baked Beans, see receipt. 

TO BOIL A HAM. 

JAMBON. 

Soak it overnight. If very dry, soak from 24 to 48 hours. 
Scrape well and put in a kettle on the fire, with plenty of cold 
water to cover it. Simmer gently from 5 to 8 hours, allowing 
about 18 or 20 minutes to the pound (see Time-table.) It 
is done when the small bone in the hock can be drawn out 
easily. Then set aside the pot for the ham to get cold in 
the water in which it was boiled. When nearly cold, care- 
fully remove the skin. Do not cut, but draw it ofif. Dot 
the top all over with black pepper. 

Or, brush the top with egg ; cover with a mixture of 
bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, sugar, and a little made mustard. 
If mustard is used, mix the egg with the bread-crumbs and 
spread all over the ham ; then set it in the oven until brown, 



FRIED HAM. 1 67 

basting frequently with 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar and a 
little boiling water in the pan. If very fat, the ham may 
remain some time in the oven with advantage, as the fat will 
melt out to a certain extent. Bake from i to 2 hours in a 
slow oven. Practical experience of this mode of treating a 
ham has proved entirely satisfactory. 

LUNCH HAM. 

Cut slices of cold, boiled ham ; broil them ; lay on a dish 
with 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of hot vinegar, pepper, and a little 
chopped parsley. 

HAM TOAST FOR BREAKFAST. 

I pint chopped lean ham, 2 beaten eggs, 

1^ ounces of butter, Toast. Pepper. 

Melt the butter ; lay in the ham. Season. When hot, stir 
in the eggs. Stir until they set slightly ; then spread on 
slices of toa«t and serve. Be careful not to let the egg 
harden too much. Cold tongue may. be used in the same 
way. 

BROILED HAM. 

JAMBON GRILLE. 

Never, if you can avoid it, broil ham which has not been 
previously boiled. It is, most unwholesome. Cut the slices 
not as thin £is for frying, about \ of an inch thick. Have the 
broiler very hot. Lay on the slices of ham, turning fre- 
quently, until thoroughly hot and slightly browned. Serve. 

FRIED HAM. 

JAMBON FRIT. 

Same rule applies to this as to broiled ham ; never fry ham 
unless previously boiled. It is unwholesome. Cut thin slices 
of ham ; have the frying-pan heated very hot ; lay the ham 
in, turning^ frequently to prevent hardening. When the fat 
is transparent, serve.

WESTPHALIA CROQUETTES. 

CROQUETTES DE JAMBON A LA WESTPHALIE. 

)i lb. of finely-chopped ham, i lb. of mashed potato, 

% gill of cream, 2 ounces of butter, 

^ teaspoon of pepper. Egg, lard, bread-crumbs. 

Mix the ham with the hot potatoes ; add the cream, butter, 
and pepper, also salt, but only if necessary. Mould into round 
balls, or long cylinder-shaped croquettes, i x 2^ inches ; dip 
in beaten egg and fine bread-crumbs. Lay in a frying-basket 
and fry in deep boiling lard until golden brown (see Gen- 
eral Directions for Frying). Serve in a pyramid on cut paper, 
garnish with parsley. For detailed directions for dipping, 
see Sweetbread Croquettes.- 

HAM SOUFFLi.. 

SOUFFL:^ AU JAMBON. 

2 gills of ham, grated as fine as pow- i teaspoon of parsley, chopped as fine 
der, as powder, 

3 eggs beaten, whites and yolks apart, Pepper and a little salt , 

Heat I dish, or several small soufifl6 cases. Mix together 
ham, parsley, yolks, pepper, and salt. Beat very hard and 
long. At the last moment add the whites beaten to a dry, 
stiff froth ; beat together only just enough to mix. Fill the 
dish f full and bake in a very hot oven from 6 to lo minutes. 
2 level tablespoonfuls of very thick Cream Sauce (see re- 
ceipt) may be beaten up with the yolks of eggs, or may be 
omitted. 

HAM PUFFS. 

I pint of water, 4 eggs, 

I pint of flour, 3 ounces of finely-chopped ham, 

5^ teaspoon of curry-powder, Cayenne. 

While the water is boiling, stir in the flour ; beat well and 
stir until the stiff batter leaves the sides of the saucepan. 
Remove from the fire, and beat in the eggs i at a time ; add 



HEAD CHEESE. 169 

the ham, curry, a pinch of cayenne and a little salt, unless 
the ham is already salt enough. Have on the fire a pan of 
deep lard. Bring it slowly to a boil (see General Directions 
for Frying). When the lard is boiling, drop in the batter in 
bits \ as large as a hen's egg. Fry golden brown ; drain on 
soft paper, and serve in a pyramid on cut paper or a folded 
napkin, garnished with parsley ; or use as a garnish for turkey, 
chickens, or veal. Note. — Ther lard should be deep enough 
to float the fritters, or they will not puff as they should. 

HAM BALLS. 

yi cup of cooked ham or tongue, Cayenne, 

2 tablespoons of dried bread-crumbs. Yolk of i egg, 

I tablespoon of chopped parsley, i gill of milk. 

Bring the milk to a boil ; add to it the crumbs ; stir it 
over the fire until it thickens. Add the ham finely chopped, 
parsley, cayenne, and the yolk of egg. Stir and mix well. 
Turn it out on the dish to cool. When cold and firm, form 
into small balls ; roll first in egg, then in bread-crumbs and 
set in the ice-box for at least l hour. Heat deep lard to a 
boil. Put the balls in a frying-basket ; plunge into the boil- 
ing lard and fry golden-brown (see General Directions for 
Frying). Then remove to a folded paper in the mouth of the 
oven for i minute to dry. Serve on a folded napkin. This 
is also a good garnish for chicken and a nice relish for break- 
fast. 

HEAD CHEESE. 

FROMAGE DE COCHON. 

Having previously cleaned it thoroughly, put a pig's head 
into a large pot ; cover with cold water. (It is assumed that 
the head has already been cleaned of all hair.) Bring it 
gradually to a boil, adding a large tablespoonful of salt. 
Boil until very tender, about 4 hours. Strip the meat from 
the bones ; throw away the eyes, which are best removed 
after the head has been boiled 2 hours ; chop the meat 
coarsely, reserving some strips of tongue whole. Season 



170 GOOD.LIVING. 

highly with sage, black pepper, powdered cloves, allspice, 
mace, thyme, and sweet marjoram, and i gill of good vine- 
gar. Meanwhile let the liquor boil down, and when the 
meat is all chopped, add a little of the liquor to slightly 
soften it. Rinse out bread-tins with cold water ; put in the 
mixture, with the strips of tongue laid lengthwise ; set away 
in a cold place to harden. A few bits of cold boiled smoked 
beef's tongue will also add to the marbled effect when cut in 
slices. The addition of a little of the liquor boiled down 
fills in the crevices with jelly. It will be ready for use as 
soon as it is quite stiff, from 6 to 12 hours. 

SCRAPPLE. 

Boil a pig's head as directed for Head Cheese with 4 
quarts of water, a little sage, salt, and pepper. Cut the 
meat from the bones, rejecting the eyes ; chop the rest quite 
fine and return it to the liquor. Add enough corn-meal to 
slightly thicken. Simmer 2 hours, when it should be of 
the consistency of soft mush, not too thick to pour. Watch 
carefully, and stir often to prevent scorching. Rinse out 
bread-pans in cold water ; pour the mixture into the pans 
and set away to harden. When cold and stiff it may be 
sliced and fried for breakfast. The slices must be rather 
more than \ an inch thick, and should be carefully turned 
with the cake-turner, as they break very easily. Serve very 
hot, and eat with a few drops of pepper-vinegar added at 
the table. 

CREOLE SAUSAGES. 

SAUCISSES A LA CRifiOLE. 

I pound of sausages (about 6 to a pound), i clove of garlic, pounded, 
I quart of tomatoes, or half a can, I teaspoon of salt, 

% saltspoon of pepper. 

Prick the sausages and lay them in a stew-pan with the 
tomatoes peeled and sliced, the garlic, and seasonings. Cover 
the saucepan closely and simmer gently 30 minutes. (The 
sauce may be slightly thickened with corn-starch.) Serve. 
Very nice for luncheon. 



SAUSAGE ROLL. 171 

FRIED SAUSAGES AND APPLES. 

SAUCISSES FRITES AUX POMMES. 

Prick the sausages and fry, turning frequently to keep 
from hardening any one side. They will require about 20 
minutes, and must not be cooked on too quick a fire. When 
the sausages are cooked, arrange them evenly in the centre 
of a hot dish. Have some sour apples cored and cut across 
in rings half an inch thick ; fry until brown in the pan in 
which the sausages have been cooked, or in another pan with 
butter. When tender and slightly browned, dish around the 
sausages and serve hot. 

SAUSAGES WITH PURAe OF POTATOES. 

SAUCISSES, PUKEE DE POMMES DE TERRE. 

Prick the sausages and lay them in the bottom of a bake- 
dish. Make a very soft pur6e of potatoes. Pour this over 
the sausages ; spread a beaten egg evenly over the top, and 
bake about 30 minutes. Serve in the same dish. Recom- 
mended. 

HOME-MADE BREAKFAST SAUSAGE. 

2 pounds of lean pork, I teaspoon of salt, 

I teaspoon of powdered sage leaves, i saltspoon of black pepper, . 

Chop the meat very fine, by the Enterprise Chopper if 
you have one. Season, Make into balls or cakes and fry 
brown in butter, 

SAUSAGE ROLL. 

I pound sausage-meat, Lard, 

Flour, Baking-powder, 

Ice-water. 

Make a rich Biscuit dough (see receipt). Put the sausage- 
meat in the middle of the paste, which you have rolled out 
about f of an inch thick ; spread out the sausage-meat to 



172 GOOD-LIVING. 

both sides ; roll the paste over this like a scroll ; moisten the 
flap to make it stick. Lay it in a long, narrow bread-pan 
with the flap uppermost, and bake 20 to 25 minutes. Brush 
the top over with egg or milk and set back into the oven to 
brown. This is a very plain and old-fashioned dish, but very 
savory. ^ 

SAUSAGES WITH CABBAGE. 
SAUCISSES AUX CHOUX. 

Scald the cabbage after cutting it a little coarser than 
coldslaw. Throw off the water. Cover again with boiling 
water, and boil until tender, about 20 minutes. Fry the 
sausages, meanwhile, until about half done ; then drain the 
cabbage ; turn into it the sausages and also the fat that has 
melted out of them ; cover and stew gently where it will not 
scorch until the sausages are quite cooked, about 30 minutes. 
Dish the sausages in the centre and make a border of the 
cabbage. Serve. 

SOUSED PIG'S FEET, OR PIG'S PETTITOES. 

Take 4 young and tender pigs' feet ; cover with cold 
water. Bring to a boil, and cook gently until so tender that 
the bones may be drawn out easily. Remove the feet 
and sprinkle a little salt over them. When cold, lay them in 
a crock. When the liquor in which the feet have boiled is 
cold, skim it, and to i quart of the liquor add i quart of 
vinegar. Put it into a china-lined kettle and boil a few min- 
utes with some whole peppers, cloves, and allspice, and pour 
it boiling over the feet. There should be liquid enough to 
cover the feet. Cover the crock ; set in a cool place and 
they will keep for some time. 

FRIED PIG'S FEET FOR BREAKFAST. 
PIEDS DE COCHON FRITS. 

Take out some of the feet prepared as above, removing 
from them all extra jelly ; roll in flour. Have some hot but* 



TOASTED BACON. 1 73 

ter in a very hot frying-pan ; lay in the feet and fry until 
brown on one side ; then turn with a cake-lifter and brown the 
other side. There should be a crisp brown crust formed in 
this way. Remove with the cake-turner to a hot dish, and 
serve. 

BACON IN BA TTER FOR BREAKFAST. 

Roll very thin slices of bacon in batter and fry in boiling 
lard. The bacon should be previously boiled and the rind 
removed. Serve alone or with fried chicken. See receipt 
for Fritter Batter. 

FRIED BACON NO. /. 

Having removed the rind, dip thin slices of boiled bacon 
in egg and bread-crumbs and fry in boiling lard. Drain dry 
and serve. 

FRIED BACON NO. II. 

Cut raw bacon in slices ^ of an inch thick and 4 inches 
long. Cut off the rind. It should be fried only until trans- 
parent, not crisp. Tilt the pan to allow the fat as it melts 
to run down, so that the bacon shall not lie in it. 

TOASTED BACON. 

Cut the slices as above ; lay them on a tin pie-plate and 
set the plate on the gridiron under the grate. It must tilt 
sUghtly, so that the bacon will not be greasy. Cook until 
transparent and slightly curled ; or it may be crisped if de- 
sired.

POULTRY. 

TO CLEAN POULTRY AND GAME. 

First twist up a piece of newspaper and light it on the 
hearth; while burning, pass the chickens, held by the neck and 
feet, backward and forward over the blaze, turning until all 
the hairs are singed off. Cut off the feet just above the 
claws. Hold the legs in boiling water for i minute or 2, and 
scrape off the scales with a knife. The French people, who 
know better than any other nation what a real roast chicken 
is, always cut the legs as described, not at the first joint of the 
drumstick as we do. The chickens dressed in this manner 
present a much better appearance. Cut off the head ; slit 
the skin of the neck down the back to near the shoulders ; 
push it off toward the front, and cut the neck off quite close 
to the shoulders. This leaves a good flap of skin to fasten 
down later. Draw down the skin over the breast and take 
out the whole craw without breaking it. Make an incision 
under the rump, just large enough to let in the fingers to 
draw it easily. Take out all the entrails, being most careful 
not to break the gall-bag, or the whole chicken will have a 
bitter, disagreeable taste, rendering it practically unfit for 
eating. Do not wash or soak poultry or game unless you 
have broken the gall-bag, in which case it should be rinsed 
out quickly with water in which there is dissolved some bak- 
ing-soda, allowing i teaspoonful to the quart. Rinse quickly 
and dry out thoroughly and immediately. It is a great mis- 
take to soak poultry or game. It may be well washed be- 

175 



1/6 GOOD.LIVING. 

fore, but not after, being drawn, and if carefully cleaned, 
will require only to be wiped out with a wet cloth, then 
dried. It is now ready for use. Cut the liver from the gall- 
bag, being again very careful with this. Cut the heart open ; 
remove any clotted blood. Draw off the outer covering of 
the gizzard, throwing away the inner sand-bag whole. Wash 
thoroughly and set aside for use. The above directions 
apply to all poultry and game, with the exception of cutting 
off the feet. In some of the smaller game the feet are left 
on; in other cases cut off; the directions will be given for 
such in its place. 

TO TRUSS A FOWL WHEN DRA WN. 

Cross the last joint of the wings above the first joint, and 
run I skewer through them and the body. Near the rump, 
each side of the opening made for drawing the fowl, make 2 
incisions, through which, by pressing back the legs very 
gently and persistently, the ends may be slipped. Then 
sew up the first opening with soft cotton. Stuff the breast 
of the bird through the neck till the craw is filled out ; turn 
under the flap of skin and skewer it to the back. Or, instead 
of treating the legs as above, tie them together at the first 
joint ; press them up against the body and run i skewer 
through them and the body. 

TO ROAST CHICKENS. 
POULETS r6tIS. 

Select a pair of nice, young, but full-grown chickens about 
I year old. The skin should be smooth and tender; the 
breastbone pliable at the point. After being cleaned as 
directed, make a dressing of i cup of stale bread-crumbs, i 
tablespoonful of melted butter, i tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley, salt and pepper. Fill the craw only ; turn the skin 
of the neck outside-in (like a glove-finger) as far as it will go, 
and fasten it on the under side with a skewer, unless you pre- 



TO ROAST CHICKENS. 1 77 

fer sewing it, in which case do not forget to remove the 
thread before serving the chicken. Now truss it. Put a 
large lump of butter into the body ; sew up the incision made 
for drawing. Turn the chicken breast upward with the rump 
toward you. Push the legs up under the skin, cross them a 
little ; run i skewer through legs and body. Turn the wings 
back. Run another skewer through them and the body of 
the chicken. Tie the legs together just below the drumsticks ; 
twist the twine around the skewer, carry it up the back; 
wrap it round the ends of the wing-skewer and tie firmly. 
Note. — In dressing capons, etc., do not cross the legs. Put 
4 slices of bacon in the roasting-pan ; lay the chickens on 
them ; rub the breasts with butter and put a tablespoonful of 
butter in the pan, adding not more than 3 or 4 tablespoonf uls 
of boiling water. They should be basted almost entirely 
with melted butter. Allow 1 5 minutes to the pound ; that 
is, I hour for a pair of chickens weighing about 4 pounds 
each. Baste every 10 minutes; 15 minutes before they are 
done, baste with the butter, dredge with flour, and return to 
the oven to brown. If in danger of browning too quickly, 
omit the flour and cover with i sheet or 2 of thick brown 
paper. They should be evenly golden brown, if properly 
roasted. When done, the flesh will feel perfectly firm under 
pressure. Do not, on any account, pierce with a fork to 
ascertain this ; it is perfectly possible without having re- 
course to such means. Never pierce cooked meat of any 
sort ; feel it with the flat side of the fork or knife, and in a 
very short time experience will teach you. White meat, 
poultry, game, veal, pork, or lamb should all feel quite firm ; 
all dark game and meats should feel elastic and springy, 
more or less according to the degree of cooking required. 
The softer they are the less they are cooked. Which means 
that white meats must be well-done all through, red or 
dark meats under-done. 

Chickens may be trussed, if preferred, according to direc- 
tions To Truss a Fowl. When done, remove the strings and 
skewers and place the chickens upon a hot dish.

178 GOOD.LIVING. 

Sauce : Put the giblets in a saucepan and cover them with 
cold water. Simmer gently as long as the chickens roast ; 
chop the giblets fine ; add i tablespoonful of flour to the pan 
in which the chickens were roasted ; stir over the fire for 
5 minutes ; then add 2 gills of the liquor in which the giblets 
were cooked ; stir until it boils. Add the giblets, pepper, 
and salt, and serve in a boat. Place a thick bed of water- 
cresses around the chickens and serve. Omit the giblet sauce 
and use the plain pan-gravy, if preferred. 

N. B. — It is much better to use a Dutch oven, if possible, 
for the above. The time required is about the same as for 
the oven. 

SMOTHERED CHICKEN. 

For this mode of cooking, select a good-sized broiler, some- 
thing, between the little broiler and the year-old roasting- 
chicken. Singe, draw (see directions), and split it down the 
back. Wipe off with first a wet, then a dry towel. Spread 
it open, and hold it in shape by passing a skewer across 
through the wings, placing the liver under one wing, the 
gizzard under the other. Now lay it in a roasting-pan ; put , 
a quarter of a pound of butter cut in pieces, 2 or 3 table- 
spoonfuls of boiling water over the chicken, and sprinkle 
with salt and pepper. Cover with a second pan that will fit 
closely and keep in all the steam. Place in the oven and 
roast for about i hour (more or less according to the size of 
the chicken). When half-done, turn the chicken over and 
finish on the second side. When done, it should be gold- 
color, not brown. If you like, have a gridiron heated 
very hot, and when the chicken is done, lay it breast down- 
ward on the bars before the fire for 3 or 4 minutes, until 
it takes the marks of the hot bars. Then lay it on a hot 
dish ; spread it thickly with butter ; sprinkle with chopped 
parsley ; let it stand about 2 minutes in a warm place to melt 
the butter ; garnish and serve. Chicken treated in this way 
will be found to have all the sweetness of the ordinary 
broiled chicken and, at the same time, be more evenly cooked 
and juicy. 



BRAISED CHICKEN WITH MACARONI. I/g 

BROILED CHICKEN. 
POULET GRILLfe AUX CRESSONS. 

For this purpose select the smallest chickens that come to 
market. Singe, draw, wipe clean, split, and spread, keeping 
in place with a skewer run through the wings and under 
side. Have the broiler very hot. Broil if possible under, 
not over, a clear, bright fire. A wood fire is the best by far 
for the purpose. Set the chicken with the under, or bone 
side, toward the hot coals. (If over the fire, turn a plate 
over the chicken.) Put a pan under the gridiron to catch 
the juices. Baste with melted butter. Broil about f of the 
time with the bone side toward the blaze. When nearly 
done, turn the breast toward the fire and broil until nicely 
browned ; be very careful not to scorch. The time will vary 
according to the size of the chicken, the average being about 
30 minutes. Serve with melted butter, pepper, salt, and 
chopped parsley ; garnish with cresses. 

BRAISED CHICKEN WITH MACARONI. 

POULET BRAIS^ AU MACARONI. 

Singe, draw, clean, and truss the chicken as directed for 
roasting. Melt a tablespoonful of butter in the frying-pan ; 
when hot, lay in, the chicken and turn until golden brown on 
all sides. Then proceed as for Plain Braise, thickening 
the gravy with a roux as directed. An average-sized fowl 
will require 2 hours ; if old, longer ; if young and tender, i 
hour and 15 minutes to i hour and 30 minutes. Mean- 
while, boil half a pound of macaroni in salted boiling water 
for 20 minutes. When tender, drain it dry. While the 
macaroni is draining, remove the chicken from the pot to a 
hot dish ; strain the sauce ; return it to the fire ; put the 
macaroni into it and simmer, not boil, for 15 to 20 minutes, 
until the macaroni has become thoroughly moistened with 
the sauce. Dish the macaroni around the chicken ; pour 



l8o GOOD-UVJNG. 

some of the remaining sauce over it, and serve the rest in a 
boat. The addition of i cup of tomatoes to the sauce when 
first put down to cook, will improve both its color and flavor. 

BRAISED CHICKEN WITH CARROTS. 

POULET BRAISE AUX GAROTTES. 

Having dressed and trussed the chicken as directed, melt 
I tablespoonful of butter in the frying-pan ; when it is hot, 
lay in the chicken, turning on all sides until evenly browned. 
Then cook it as directed for Plain Braise, adding i cup 
of tomatoes, 4 large carrots cut in strips and fried in butter, 
also a roux as directed. Serve with the carrots around the 
chicken, and the sauce strained and served in a boat. 

BRAISED CHICKEN WITH JERUSALEM ARTI- 
CHOKES. 

POULET BRAISE AUX TOPINAMBOURS. 

Braise the chicken as directed above, thickening the 
gravy with a roux. Make a pur6e of Jerusalem arti- 
chokes thus : Select about 2 quarts of the largest artichokes ; 
wash them and put them down to boil in a pot of boiling 
water. Boil 15 to 25 minutes, according to size, until tender. 
Drain, peel, mash through a colander ; add salt and pepper, 
butter the size of a walnut, and cream to moisten the pur6e 
to the consistency of soft mashed potatoes. Failing cream, 
use the sauce of the chicken to moisten it. Return to the 
fire in a china-lined saucepan ; when thoroughly hot, dish it 
around the chicken ; strain some of the chicken-gravy over it, 
and serve the rest in a boat. Or, wash, peel, and boil the 
artichokes as directed ; strain the gravy of the chicken ; put 
chicken, artichokes, and gravy back into the pot and stew 
gently until the artichokes begin to melt away. This 
system is better with a fowl, as it will bear the prolonged 
cooking and be improved by it. In this case, add the arti- 
chokes at least i hour before the fowl should be finished. 
Delicious.

SPANISH CHICKEN. ' 

POULET A L'ESPAGNOLE. 

2 chickens, 2 gills of sweet oil, 

4 small onions, chopped, i clove of garlic, 

2 cans of tomatoes, 2 bay-leaves, 

% lady-finger pepper, without seeds. Parsley, 

Sprig of thyme. Salt and pepper, 

2 slices of bacon or %, lb. of ham, % sweet Spanish pepper. 

Singe, clean and joint the chickens as for fricassee. Bone 
the drumsticks. If old, remove the skin. Lay the pieces in 
ice-water and i tablespoonful of vinegar for i hour. Put the 
oil (or sweet drippings) into a large frying-pan. Put in first 
the largest pieces of chicken, and then the smaller. Put the 
breasts with the meat downward. Fry until a delicate gold 
color. Remove the pieces as they brown to a large stewpan. 
Add the onions, etc., etc., the bacon or ham to be cut in nar- 
row strips. Stew for i hour, if the chickens are very young ; 
from this to 2 hours and 30 minutes, according to the quality 
of the chickens. They must become perfectly tender. Re- 
move the chickens and pieces of ham. Dish first the inferior 
pieces and finish with the best. Strain the sauce. Return it 
to the fire and boil rapidly for 1 5 minutes longer. If not 
thick enough, add a very little corn-starch blended with a few 
drops of cold water, and boil 2 minutes. Pour some of the 



1 82 GOOD-LIVING. 

sauce over the chicken, serve the rest in a boat. Decorate 
the dish, if you want to make it as attraptive to the eye as it 
is pleasing to the palate, with diamond-shaped Croiitons (see 
receipt), mushrooms, quarters of hard-boiled eggs, olives, etc. 
These latter are not essential. The above receipt resembles 
very much the Poulet k la Marengo, but is much easier to 
make. 

CHICKEN SOUFFLE. 

2 gills White Sauce ( see receipt), 3 yolks of eggs. 

Salt, 3 whites beaten to a stiff froth. 

Pepper, ^ lb. of cold chicken. 

Boil the sauce till it forms a thick paste. Cut the chicken 
very fine and rub it through a sieve ; or pound it in a mortar 
before passing through the sieve. Mix it with the sauce and 
seasoning. Beat in the yolks of eggs. Heat and butter i 
bake-dish or several small souffl6-cases. At the last moment 
stir the whites of eggs very lightly into the mixture ; fill 
the dish \ full and bake in a very hot oven 8 to 12 minutes. 
The flavor of the above may be varied by passing mush- 
rooms through the sieve with the chicken, observing the 
same proportions. This dish must be eaten immediately, as 
standing spoils it. 

FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN. I. 

FRICASSEE DE POULET I.

1 teaspoon of butter, i gill of flour, 

3 tablespoons of cream, 3 yolks of eggs, 

2 carrots. White wine and mushrooms may be added. 

Cut the chickens, when cleaned, in pieces. Use the finer 
parts for the fricass6e ; the coarser parts for the sauce. Put 
the coarser pieces into a chinarlined saucepan with the water, 
spices, onion, parsley, pork etc. Simmer 30 minutes, then 
add the finer pieces. Let them boil slowly until done, from 
I to 2 hours according to the quality of the chickens. They

must cook very slowly. When very tender, take out the 
finer pieces ; keep them warm while you prepare the sauce. 
Strain the gravy; skim. Return it to the fire. Blend 
together the butter and flour over the fire in another sauce- 
pan ; do not let them brown. When well blended, add some 
of the boiling gravy and stir until perfectly smooth ; then add 
the rest of the gravy. Stir and boil 4 or 5 minutes. Remove 
from the fire and stir in quickly the yolks of eggs beaten up 
with the cream. Add the lemon-juice. Do not boil again 
after the eggs are added or it will curdle. Add wine to taste 
and mushrooms, if liked. Serve in a border of rice or mashed 
potatoes with sauce poured over the chicken.

FRICASSEE DE POULET II. 

Fricassee your chicken (see receipt). To the rich creamy 
sauce, add just enough curry-powder, rubbed smooth, to 
flavor the sauce slightly and to give it a pretty yellow tint. 
Have some Boiled Rice (see receipt) ; when it is dry, add to it 
just enough stewed, strained tomato-juice to make it a pretty 
light-red. Make a wall of this around the edge of the dish ; 
in the centre place the pieces of chicken, the coarser parts 
below, the best on top ; pour over this the yellow sauce. 
Sprinkle a little finely-chopped parsley over; stick little 
sprigs of fresh green parsley at even distances around be- 
tween the yellow and pink; garnish the edge of the dish 
with hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters, and you have, with 
very little trouble, a dish equally pleasing to both palate 
and eye.

s84 GOOD-LIVING. 

simmers, add the butter and flour rubbed together until 
smooth ; the corn cut from the cob, the limas, bacon, salt, 
pepper, and a pinch of cayenne. Let all stew slowly together 
until done. If the fowl. are tough, however, they will need 2 
hours or even 2 hours and 30 minutes, in which case the 
vegetables should not be added until about i hour before the 
fowl are to be done. If young chickens, they will not require 
more than i hour to i hour and 30 minutes, according to 
size. Serve the fowl in the centre of the dish with the 
vegetables around, and the sauce in the boat.

of boiling water ; cover and stew until tender. Then mash 
them through a strainer into the saucepan containing the 
chicken. Simmer very gently until the chicken is tender. 
An old fowl will require fully 2 hours or more ; a young 
chicken about i hour. About 12 minutes before serving, 
bring to a brisk boil, and drop in the Dumplings (see receipt). 
Cover the saucepan ; boil rapidly 10 or 12 minutes. Remove 
the dumplings, and keep them warm while you dish the 
chicken. Pour the gravy over ; place the dumplings around 
the dish, and serve. N. B. — Take care that the sauce does 
not scorch while the dumplings are cooking, as this happens 
very easily.

^ cold boiled chicken, chopped very fine, Salt pork, 

4 sausages, chopped very fine, 3 eggs. 

Grated bread-crumbs. Nutmeg, 

Pepper and salt. Lemon-juice, 
I gill of wine, white or red. 

Remove the chicken from the bone ; remove the skins of the 
sausages, and chop both as fine as paste. Use an Enterprise 
Chopper if you have it. The bulk of bread-crumbs should 
equal that of the chicken, as should also the bulk of sausage 
meat, that is, about ^ of each. Mix all well together ; add 
the seasonings to taste. Meanwhile boil in a saucepan the 
bones of the chicken, covered with boiling water, 2 cloves of 
garlic, 3 cloves, and 6 allspice. When it has boiled long 
enough to be well flavored, about 30 minutes, use some of 
the water to moisten the p4t6. Lastly, add the wine and 
eggs ; mix thoroughly. Line a tin mould with straight sides 
with thin slices of salt pork, covering every part of the sur- 
face. Pour in the mixture ; cover also with thin slices of 
pork. Tie over the top a well-buttered paper, and put in a 
very moderate oven for about i hour, or a little longer, until 
set perfectly firm. The oven must neither be too quick, or 
the loaf will crack, nor to slow, or the loaf will be dried out. 
When done, set away to cool. When cold, turn out of the 
mould, remove the slices of pork, and serve surrounded with 
jelly. Or, having rinsed the same mould in cold water, fill it 
to the depth of a ^ inch with jelly (use jelly as directed 
for Jellied Tongue). When this is firm, set in the p^td ; fill 
the remaining space between the pat6 and sides of the mould 
with the liquid jelly, and set away to harden. Foursome of 
the same jelly into a shallow dish and set away also. When 
ready to serve, turn the jellied pdt6 out carefully, crumb the 
the jelly in the shallow dish with a fork, arrange it tastefully 
around the base of the pit6, and serve. Decorate and gar- 
nish to tastCw Recommended.

CHICKEN CROQUETTES NO. I. 

CROQUETTES DE VOLAILLE I. 

2 chickens, boiled, i nutmeg, grated, 

I pair of brains, boiled. Salt, 

1 cup of chopped suet, 2 sprigs of parsley, chopped, 

I lemon, juice and grated rind, i small tablespoon of grated onion. 

Cream, or same quantity of White Sauce, Black pepper and cayenne. 

Chop or grind the meat as fine as possible (use Enterprise 
Chopper if you have it) ; mix all well together and add 
enough cream or thick White Sauce (see receipt) to make it 
quite soft. The white sauce is best, as it hardens when cold, 
enabling you to mould the croquettes much more easily. 
When subjected to the heat of frying it becomes soft and 
creamy again. After making the croquettes a few times you 
will ascertain by experience exactly how the mixture should 
feel to the touch. To mould the croquettes into shape when 
the mixture is cold, have on the table by you a plate of 
flour, a saucer of beaten egg, and a deep bowl of sifted 
bread-crumbs. Flour your hands well ; take a tablespoonful 
of the meat, roll it between the palms of your hands, and 
shape evenly and neatly. Do not make them too narrow for 
tlieir length or they may break in frying : say i x 2j inches. 
Dip them first in the egg, then in the crumbs, keeping them 
well shaped, covering with just as much crumb as they will 
take up. Then place on a flat dish, separate from one 
another that the air may reach all parts. Set away in the 
ice-box for at least i hour. Use only i hand for the 
bread-crumbs, if possible, and i for the eggs, or you will 
soon find yourself with thimbles of dipping on all 10 
fingers. This amount of croquette-meat will make about 24 
medium-sized croquettes. When ready to cook them, have 
deep lard boiling in a kettle. Use a frying-basket. Lay the 
croquettes in the basket and proceed as directed in General 
Directions for Frying. When golden brown, skim out and 
lay on a clean piece of paper in the mouth of the oven to 
dry. When dry, dish tastefully on a cut paper or folded 



JELLIED CHICKEN. I93 

napkin. Garnish with a large bunch of Fried Parsley (see 
receipt). 

N. B. — Boil the brains previously as directed (see receipt) 
The croquettes should be as soft as thick cream in the inside 
when served, with a delicate gold-colored covering outside.

bones. Pick off the meat ; chop very fine (use Enterprise 
Chopper if you have it), and season with salt and pepper. 
Rinse out a smooth mould in cold water. Lay in the bottom 
some slices of cold hard-boiled &g'g, then a layer of the 
chopped chicken, another layer of egg, another of chicken, 
and so on until the mould is filled. Boil down the broth of 
the chicken to about 3 gills ; strain ; season with pepper, salt, 
and cayenne if necessary ; pour over the chicken. Set away 
in a cold place for several hours until firm, then turn it out 
and serve with salad. This is a good dish for tea. Or^ when 
the liquor is ready to pour over the chicken, let it cool, and 
add to about 2 gills of it the same quantity of rich Mayon- 
naise Sauce (see receipt). Fill the mould with this mixed 
with chicken ; set away to harden ; turn out and serve with 
a salad.

ily, but gently, for i hour longer. Dish the fowl. Strain 
out the rice and leeks and heap around the fowl. Return 
the broth to the fire. Now blend together over the fire 
about I tablespoonful each of flour and butter; do not 
brown. Stir in enough of the boiling chicken-broth to 
make the sauce as thick as rich cream. Pour this over the 
fowl. Garnish and serve. Should the fowl be very tough, 
allow 1 5 to 30 minutes longer cooking before adding the rice. 

TO ROAST A TURKEY. 

DINDE ROTIE. 

Clean and prepare the turkey as directed, trussing it ac- 
cording to Directions for Trussing a Fowl. A young hen- 
turkey is best for roasting. Before trussing it, fill the craw 
with any of the Dressings (see receipts) you may fancy; 
chestnut stuffing is highly recommended, if obtainable. It 
is generally advisable not to stuff the body unless the dress- 
ing selected is very moist and not too high-flavored, which 
would take away from the delicate quality of the bird itself. 
However, that is a matter of taste ; but it is urged that the 
body should not be filled with any dry stuffing, or the juices 
of the bird will be absorbed by it and the meat greatly 
injured in quality. It is recommended to put into the bbdy 
of the turkey its own liver and a large spoonful of butter. 



TURKE Y-CHICK. 197 

After the turkey is trussed, dredge thoroughly with flour, 
rubbing it in with the hand. Set it in the roasting-pan ; 
put 2 large tablespoonfuls of butter and about 4 tablespoon- 
fuls of boiling water in the pan ; set the pan in the oven (un- 
less you are equipped for roasting before the fire in the good, 
old-fashioned way). The oven must be moderate. A second 
pan should be placed over the turkey to prevent the breast- 
bone from browning and perhaps burning, before the turkey 
is thoroughly done. Baste very frequently, and watch with 
a most solicitous and careful eye that the fire is not 
hot dnough to burn, or cool enough to dry out the 
turkey. One weighing, before cleaning, about 8 pounds, 
should be allowed i hour and 30 to 45 minutes, or rather 
more than 10 minutes per pound. A very large turkey, not 
less than 3 hours. When nearly done, remove the top pan 
and baste again, until well-browned all over. Then take the 
turkey from the pan ; set the pan on the top of the range ; 
add a small pinch of flour, a little boiling water, and stir ; 
add the giblets and liver (previously boiled), the former 
chopped, the latter mashed. Stir 2 or 3 minutes ; add salt 
and pepper and serve in a sauce-boat. Garnish the turkey 
with cresses or parsley. 

N.B. — If your turkey is not young and tender, do not 
attempt to roast it. In that case, cook it according to re- 
ceipt for Plain Braise, Turkey En Daube or Boiled Turkey 
(see receipts), 

TURKEY.CHICK. 

DINDONNEAU. 

This is a most dainty and delicate dish. The turkeys 
should weigh from 2 to 3, or at most 3 J lbs. They are then 
in perfection. Split one down the back, after having 
cleaned it as directed (see Directions for Cleaning Poul- 
try). Spread it open, exactly as a chicken for broiling. 
Rub it all over with butter ; lay it in a roasting-pan ; put 2 
tablespoonfuls of butter in small bits over it, and about 



198 GOOD-LIVING. 

3 tablespoonfuls of boiling water in the pan. Cover it with 
another pan that will fit it air-tight, to keep in the steam. 
Place this in a moderately-quick oven. Baste it occasion- 
ally, closing again tightly and quickly. It will take from 45 
to 60 minutes. When cooked, dish it ; pour the butter from 
the pan over it ; sprinkle with salt and pepper ; garnish with 
cresses or parsley, and serve either with Cucumber Salad, 
Celery Mayonnaise, or with a mayonnaise of tomatoes, espe- 
cially if the latter are from the hot-house, or Primeurs. If 
served as an entree, instead of taking the place of game 
or roast at dinner, it is excellent with Chestnut Sauce (see 
receipt), but is best as first indicated. In Europe this is 
considered a great delicacy, but is not as yet sufficiently 
known or appreciated in this country. 

TURKE Y EN DA UBE. 

DINDE EN DAUBE. 

Large hen-turkey, not too young, Slice of salt pork. 

Bunch of parsley, Half calf's foot, 

Bunch of thyme, 2 onions, sliced. 

Bunch of celery leaves, ' 2 carrots, " 

Chervil, lo cloves. 

Bouquet of sweet herbs, I clove of garlic, 

6 gills of broth, 2 tablespoons of brandy, 

I bay-leaf, I pint of vrhite wine. 
Pepper and salt. 

Clean and dress your turkey, which should not be too 
young, or it will go to pieces before being properly cooked. 
If liked, lard the breast with strips of salt pork, salt, pepper, 
parsley, chervil, and thyme ; but this may be omitted. Fill 
the craw with one of the various Dressings (see receipts). 
Sew up and truss as directed. Lay in the bottom of a deep, 
large iron pot slices of fat pork, the calf's foot, salt, pepper, 
onions, carrots, herbs, etc. On this bed, lay the turkey. 
Pour over it the broth, brandy, and white wine. Cover. 
Wring out a clean cloth in hot water, and twist it around 
the lid to prevent the escape of steam. Simmer very slowly 



ROAST TURKEY WITH TRUFFLES. 199 

for fully 5 hours, or more, if old, turning it once with great 
care when about half cooked. When done, lift the turkey 
out upon a hot dish ; skim and strain the sauce ; pour some 
over the turkey, serve the rest in a sauce-boat. When set 
away to cool, put the turkey in a large bowl ; pour all of its 
sauce around, and it will become jellied. This, although 
apparently an elaborate dish, is, in fact, perfectly practicable, 
and the result is, a Christmas turkey fit for a king. 

BOILED TURKEY. 
DINDE, SAUCE BLANCHE. 

Select by preference a hen-turkey. Draw it carefully (see 
directions). Rinse it out with cold water and a pinch of 
baking-soda. Wipe dry. Truss it (see directions). Stuif 
the craw with a dressing of oysters (see Force-meats), with 
celery cut in |-inch pieces added to the force-meat. Rub 
the bird all over with lemon-juice, to whiten the skin, and 
lay it in boiling water ; or, better still, flour a cloth and tie 
the turkey in it. Boil very slowly, allowing 1 5 to 20 minutes 
to the pound. The older and tougher the turkey, the more 
gently it must cook, and the longer; then it will not be 
stringy. Serve with Oyster and Celery Sauce (see receipts). 
Miss Leslie says : " With a turkey (boiled) there should be 
on table a ham or a smoked tongue." This is an old- 
fashioned custom, and one which we cannot improve upon. 
If not boiled in a cloth, the broth from the turkey will make 
an excellent soup next day, boiled down with rice, vege- 
tables, and seasonings. 

A dressing of Sausage Force-meat may be substituted for 
the above, if preferred.

truffles (the very best to be had), J of a nutmeg, |- of a tea- 
spoonful of white pepper, and i bay-leaf ; stir over the fire 
for IS minutes, and set away to cool. When cold, put 2 
tablespoonfuls of the mixture into the craw of the turkey ; 
put the remainder into the body of the turkey. Sew it up. 
Truss, and hang it in a cool, dry place for about 5 days in 
winter; in warmer weather, 2 days. Roast as directed for 
Roast Turkey, and serve with Truffle or Madeira Sauce.

GUINEA-FOWL. 

PINTADE r6tIE. 

This is a bird which seems to be but little known or appre- 
ciated in this country, whereas " Pintade Rotie " is almost 
as familiar on the Continental menu as is " Poulet Rdti," 
and very certainly appears often under the guise of other 
game. A young, tender guinea-fowl is not to be despised. 
The marks by which the younger ones are known are that 



ROAST GOOSE. 20I 

the breast bone is pliant at the tip, the wings very tender, 
and the legs smooth, free from feathers, and of a pale-yellow 
color. When well selected and well cooked, they are not 
very inferior to pheasants and partridges. They may be 
rocisted (see Roast Chicken) ; but it is recommended that 
they be cooked according to either of the following receipts. 

BROILED GUINEA-FOWL. 
PINTADE GRILL^E. 

If very young and tender, singe, draw, split, and broil as 
directed for Broiled Chicken. Serve on a bed of water- 
cresses, with a salad. 

BRAISED GUINEA-FOWL. 

PINTADE BRAIS^E. 

Proceed exactly as directed for a Plain Braise, using 2 
carrots and 2 onions sliced and fried brown, and the gravy 
thickened with a roux of browned butter and flour. They 
should be trussed as for roasting, and not stuffed. Cook 
them very slowly and gently for about i hour and 1 5 min- 
utes, if young and tender ; longer, if old and tough. When 
done, remove them to a hot dish ; place the carrots around 
the birds ; strain the gravy ; pour some of it over the birds, 
and serve the rest in a sauce-boat. 

Or, omit the thickening, and do not serve the carrots, but 
garnish with water-cresses .and serve as a roast with a salad. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

oiE r6tie. 

This IS a most savory dish, provided your goose be a ten- 
der one ; therefore it is essential to make sure of this fact 
before beginning. This is readily ascertained by one who 
has the habit of drawing poultry. In selecting it, see that 
the end of the breast bone yields easily to pressure ; that 



202 GOOD.LTVING. 

the wings are supple and very tender at the pinion ; that the 
legs are smooth and yellow and free from feathers. A 
" green goose " is most desirable for roasting, if j^ou can get 
It. If there is any doubt about the tenderness of your 
goose, do not attempt to roast it ; braise it according to the 
receipt for Plain Braise, and you can serve it with all the 
appearance of being roasted,. and at the same time ensure 
its being good eating. 

Draw, singe, and wipe out the bird, but do not wash it if 
it can be avoided ; have it as sweet and clean as possible. 
If not perfectly sweet, you may rinse it out quickly with a 
quart of cold water in which is dissolved i teaspoonful of 
baking-soda. Make a dressing. Unless you prefer some 
other, the following is a good one : 

4 apples, peeled and cored, ^ teaspoon of thyme, 

4 onions, sliced. Mashed potato, 

4 leaves of sage, Pepper and salt. 

Boil the apples, onions, and herbs with sufficient water to 
cover them ; when soft, rub all through a sieve ; add enough 
mashed potato to make it sufficiently firm for a dressing, but 
not dry enough to stick to the hands. Season with pepper 
and salt, and stuff the bird, both craw and body. Sew it 
up. Truss it (see directions). Tie and skewer it firmly. 
Put it into a roasting-pan with a large lump of butter or 
sweet drippings and about 3 tablespoonfuls of boiling water. 
Rub the breast of the goose well with butter ; sprinkle with 
salt and pepper. Baste very frequently, every 10 or 15 
minutes, and each time thoroughly. Roast about i hour 
and 30 minutes. Watch the oven, that your goose may not 
cook too quickly or get over-done. If in danger of brown- 
ing too much, cover it with a second pan and turn some of 
the heat off from the oven. If the goose is not at the young- 
est, or " green," stage, you must cover it from the beginning, 
roast it longer, and with more moderate fire, basting very 
often and browning at the last. The time given allows for 
a good-sized bird. 



SALMI OF TAME DUCK. 203 

Sauce : Boil the giblets apart ; chop the gizzards and mash 
the liver. When the goose is cooked, remove it from the 
pan to a hot dish. Remove strings and skewers. Set the 
pan on the top of the range ; add a little boiling water ; stir ; 
blend a teaspoonful of corn-starch with a little cold water ; 
stir it into the boiling gravy ; add the giblets, etc., salt, pep- 
per, and boil 3 minutes. Serve in a sauce-boat. Garnish 
the goose with water-cresses, and serve with Apple Sauce 
(see receipt). 

TAME DUCK. 

CANARDS r6TIS, 

Proceed exactly as for Roast Goose (see receipt), stuffing 
with sage and onion dressing. The same remarks apply as 
to their tenderness ; if you are not perfectly certain of it, do 
not risk roasting, but prepare them according to receipt for 
Plain Braise. If roasted, allow i hour for large ones ; baste 
frequently. They require to be cooked much longer than 
wild ducks. Serve with giblet sauce, if liked ; otherwise, 
with the plain pan-gravy in a sauce-boat. Serve with green 
peas, spinach, or a salad. Apple sauce or currant jelly may 
be handed at the same time. A very savory accompaniment 
is Onion or Soubise Sauce (see receipt). 

SALMI OF TAME DUCK. 

SALMI DE CANARD. 

Cut cold duck into neat pieces. Put the giblets into a 
saucepan with the amount of hot water you will require for 
the sauce, more or less according to the quantity of duck. 
Add to it 2 onions, 2 sprigs of parsley, both chopped fine, 
3 cloves, I leaf of sage, pepper and salt. Cover, and let the 
sauce simmer for about i hour, until well flavored. Add the 
pieces of duck ; let them stew slowly for 2 hours, adding a 
little more boiling water if necessary. Just before it is done, 
add I gill of port wine and a little lemon-juice. Blend a tea- 
spoonful of corn-starch with a little cold water ; stir it into 



204 GOOD.LIVING. 

the boiling sauce, and boil 2 minutes; or thicken with a 
Brown Roux (see receipt). Arrange the duck neatly on a 
hot dish ; pour the gravy over, and garnish the edge with 
large, diamond-shaped Croutons (see receipt). Or make a 
Rice Border (see receipt), and serve with the stew in the 
centre. 

The quantity of corn-starch required depends upon the 
amount of sauce to be thickened, i large teaspoonful being 
sufficient to thicken i pint of sauce. A few handfuls of 
fresh green peas boiled first, may be added to the stew lO or 
1 5 minutes before it is served ; or add a handful of stoned 
olives.

GAME. 
WILD DUCKS. 

CANARDS SAUVAGES. 

These should always be plain roasted the first day, and 
under no circumstances should they be stuffed. Of course 
canvas-backs stand at the head of the list, but red-heads 
are undoubtedly second. It sometimes happens that the 
more ordinary kinds of ducks, though they may be of the 
tenderest, have a most unpleasantly strong flavor. It is said 
that a parboiled onion placed in the body of one of this 
kind, will frequently absorb the strong, disagreeable quality 
and make the duck very acceptable, if its skin is not eaten ; 
this also contributes to its rankness. In case the onion sys- 
tem is tried, the reader is warned that it must be removed 
most carefully as soon as the duck is taken from the fire. 
Have at hand a bowl of cold water, and the instant the 
onion is taken out of the duck, plunge it under the water, and 
take it away as quickly as possible, for in its turn it becomes 
most offensive. 

If the ducks are of the choicest kind, leave the heads on, 
and when plucked, singed, drawn, truss them with the head 
under the wing. Tie the legs together to keep them from 
spreading, and cut the wings off close to the body ; a duck- 
wing never being served, and often proving a sad stumbling, 
block to the carver. In cleaning ducks, avoid washing them ; 
simply wipe them out with a wet cloth and dry them imme- 
diately. The fire should be in good order, and the oven 

ao5 



2o6 GOOD.LIVING. 

fiercely hot. Put the ducks both (if of the same size) in the 
roasting-pan, unless you, are fortunate enough to be able to 
roast them before the fire ; put a large lump of butter in the 
pan, with 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of boiling water. Rub the 
breasts of the ducks with butter. Now put the ducks in the 
oven ; if your fire is right, they will be done to a turn in 1 5 
minutes, if of medium size. Baste frequently. As a rule 
there is often i duck of the pair a little larger than the other ; 
in this case, the larger duck must be piit in the pan in the 
oven alone, first, for 3 to 5 minutes, according to the differ- 
ence in size ; then add in the smaller duck and cook 1 5 
minutes. This time is exact (if the fire is right) for ducks 
the size of canvas-backs and red-heads. If much larger, 
allow 20 minutes or more. The epicure is much shocked if 
wild duck is cooked beyond the point of the blood running 
red when pierced with a fork in carving. Be sure the plates 
on which they are to be served are put to heat long enough 
beforehand to get them very hot. Better far let the guest 
wait a minute or two for the ducks than to allow the ducks 
to wait for the guest. Carve the ducks in thick slabs, not in 
thin, wafery slices, as is too often seen. The perfect way of 
serving ducks (when they are the dish par excellence, as, for 
instance, at a game supper), is to allow half a duck to each 
guest, and serve it on a hot-water plate. In the land of 
ducks the dish is frequently garnished with small croquettes 
of fried hominy. The usual mode of serving is to hand at 
the same time currant jelly and dressed celery. 

SALMI OF WILD DUCK WITH OLIVES. 

SALMI DE CANARD AUX OLIVES. 

The next day, take the legs, wings, and all the good parts 
of the ducks that remain ; cut them into neatly-shaped pieces 
and make thereof a tJisty brown stew ; that is, rub together 
over the fire until brown i tablespoonful each of butter and 
flour ; add by degrees 3 J gills of good broth, and stir until 
smooth. Boil until sufficiently thick ; season with salt, pep-

per ; lay in the pieces of duck, and set on one side to warm, 
and stew gently for 30 to 45 minutes ; add wine to taste and 
a few olives cut from the stones. Garnish with diamond- 
shaped Crofltons (see receipt). 

WILD DUCK WITH JELLY SAUCE. 

Cut pieces of cold wild duck evenly ; warm them slowly 
in a sauce made of i large tablespoonful of butter, \ a 
tumbler of currant jelly, and i gill of port wine. 

ROAST GROUSE. 

Prepare exactly the same as partridge, allowing less time 
for the cooking ; being dark-fleshed game, they should be 
served underdone. If the oven is just right, they will 
require about 25 minutes, or a little more according to size. 
When sufficiently cooked, the meat should feel quite elastic 
under pressure of the fork. They must never be thoroughly 
cooked through. Serve the sauce from the pan in a sauce- 
boat. Dish the grouse on slices of toast moistened with 
.broth and buttered ; garnish with water-cresses, or with 
Fried Breadcrumbs (see receipt) and parsley. Serve with a 
salad. 

BROILED GROUSE. 

If the grouse are young and tended, broil according to 
either receipt given for Broiled Partridge, cooking 10 or 15 
minutes less. Garnish with cresses and serve with a salad. 

WOODCOCK AND SNIPE. 

B:fiCASSES ET B^CASSINES SAUTl^ES. 

Pluck and clean, but never draw either of these birds if 
you are preparing them for epicures ; to have the birds 
served without the trail would be quite shocking, in their 
judgment. The heads should also remain on. Pluck the 
neck and skin the head carefully. Twist the neck around 



208 COODJJVING, 

and run the beak through legs and body ; this rounds out 
the breast. Have a deep pan with lard enough to com- 
pletely immerse the birds. When you are certain that it is 
boiling (see General Directions for Frying), lay the birds in 
and leave them from 3 to 5 minutes, according to their size ; 
for these same epicures decree that the birds must be served 
very underdone. Prepare a slice of toast for each moistened 
with butter and broth. Place a bird on each slice of toast 
and serve with a salad. 

WOODCOCK AND SNIPE ROASTED NO. I. 

B^CASSES ET B^CASSINES r6tIES I. 

Do not draw these birds ; otherwise proceed exactly as 
for roasting quail. Allow about ^ the length of time to 
cook, as they should be served very underdone. Each bird 
should be rolled, when trussed, in a thin slice of fat pork, 
not bacon ; lay each one in the roasting-pan on a piece of 
toast, which piece of toast, absorbing all the juices that fall 
from the bird in cooking, must be served under it. Remove 
the pork. Garnish with water-cresses ; serve with a salad. 
Hand at the same time currant jelly. This latter is a matter 
of taste.

Tie a strip of pork around each ; run a small iron skewer 
through the birds and tie it to the spit, if you can roast be- 
fore the fire, otherwise put them on a roasting-pan in the 
oven. Have a fiercely hot fire. Place the roasting-pan, with 
slices of buttered toast, beneath to catch whatever falls from 
the birds in cooking. Baste with melted butter. Roast 
from 12 to 15 minutes; then sprinkle the birds with salt and 
pepper, and serve on the toast. Garnish with cresses- Serve

REED-BIRDS. 

ORTOLANS. 

As a rule, never draw these birds ; cook them with the trail 
in. Simply pick, wash, clean, and quickly wipe them ; truss 
neatly, and lay in boiling lard for 3 to 5 minutes. Serve 
very hot on toast. Serve at the same time a salad. 

REED-BIRDS BROILED.

This is an exception to the above rule, for the birds must 
be drawn. When clean, split ; place them in the folds of a 
clean towel, and, with the rolling-pin, crush the bones quite 
flat. Season with salt and pepper; spread on a very hot 
greased broiler. Broil them over a clear fire, turning the 
inner side toward the fire ; in a minute or two, turn. Con. 
tinue to turn until browned outside. The fire must be very 
quick that the outside may sear without cooking the inside 
too much. They will not require more than 4 or 5 minutes, 
as reed-birds are always served under-done. Serve on soft, 
buttered toast ; put a little salt and pepper and melted butter 
on each. Garnish with cresses and serve with a salad.

through the wings and body. Have a clear, hot fire. Heat 
the gridiron first. Grease it well. Lay the bird on the grid- 
iron with the inner (or bone) side toward the coals. Broil 
the bird under, not over the fire, if possible. Now rub the 
breast all over with butter ; place a pan under the gridiron to 
receive all the butter and juice that may drop in the cooking. 
Turn the bird from time to time, leaving it at least twice as 
long with the inner side toward the blaze. Each time you 
turn it, brush it with melted butter. It will require to cook 
about 25 minutes. Being white-fleshed game, partridges re- 
quire to be thoroughly cooked through, and, as their one 
fault is dryness, they must be constantly basted and carefully 
watched, that they do not scorch or get over-done. Have 
ready slices of buttered toast. Trim the crust from the edges 
and moisten with the butter from the pan. Lay the bird on 
the toast ; put a little melted butter on the breast ; sprinkle 
with pepper and salt. Serve with a salad.

Split and prepare as above ; lay in a tin pan with slices of 
pork over the breasts ; put butter the size of a walnut, pepper

pan. Cover air-tight to keep the steam in. Set in the oven. 
Baste frequently. They will require 20 to 30 minutes ac- 
cording to the heat of the oven. When sufficiently cooked, 
the flesh should feel quite firm under pressure of the fork. 
Do not pierce the skin with the fork or the juices will escape ; 
simply press with the flat side of it, and you will easily ascer- 
tain when it is cooked. The softer the flesh is, the more 
under-done. Garnish with cresses and serve as directed in 
preceding receipt. This last way of cooking partridges has 
the advantage of making them very juicy. If you wish to 
give the appearance to the bird of having been broiled, heat 
the gridiron very hot, and, when you remove the partridge

Choux is quite a classical dish among the French. 

BROILED QUAIL. 
CAILLES GRILL^ES. 

Pluck, clean, and split the birds, wiping with a damp cloth, 
not washing. Heat the gridiron. Lay the birds upon it 
with the under, or bone, side toward the coals. Rub the 
breasts with butter. Broil for about 8 minutes ; then turn the 
breast side toward the fire and broil about 5 minutes more, 
13 to IS minutes in all. Do not let them scorch or dry too 
much. Have ready a piece of toast for each bird. Trim off 
the crusts ; moisten with a few drops of boiling broth, and 
butter the tocist generously. Lay the birds upon the toast ; 
butter the breasts ; sprinkle with pepper and salt. Set in the 
oven I minute for the butter to melt. Garnish with cresses 
and serve with a salad. 

ROASTED QUAIL. 

CAILLES r6tIES. 

Clean, draw, and truss neatly. Tie a piece of fat pork 
over the breast of each bird. Put the birds in a baking-pan 
with I tablespoonful of butter and 2 of boiling water. 
Stand the pan in the oven for 1 5 to 20 minutes, according 
to the size of the birds and heat of the oven, basting fre- 
quently with hot butter from the pan. Have ready a piece 



QUAILS £JV COMPOTE (COLD). 213 

of toast for each bird; remove the crust; moisten with 
boiling broth and butter. Remove the pork from the birds ; 
stand them upon the toast ; add salt and pepper ; garnish 
with cresses and serve with a salad. 

QUAIL SAUTM in lard. 

CAILLES SAUT^ES. 

Quail done in this way have all the appearance of being 
roasted, and at the same time preserve all their juices. 
These being inclined to be rather dry birds, this mode ol 
cooking appears to be one of the best. 

Pluck, draw, and truss the birds neatly, wiping them 
inside and out with a wet cloth, but not washing them. 
Tie the legs and wings close to the sides ; or skewer them 
with small wooden tooth-picks, which serve admirably for 
the purpose. Run one through the two wings and body ; 
another through the two legs and body ; thus pinning them 
close to the sides. Have a pan with lard deeper than 
the height of the birds, so that they may be completely 
immersed in the fat. Bring it slowly to boiling point (see 
General Directions for Frying). When the lard is ready, 
lay the birds in with the skimmer. Do not put in more 
at a time than you can attend to well. They must be 
turned constantly, that they may cook and brown evenly. 
In about 8 minutes, if the heat is intense enough, the 
birds will be done. You can ascertain this by pressing the 
breast with the flat side of the fork ; if perfectly firm, the 
bird is cooked. Drain thoroughly and serve on toast, as 
directed for Roast Quail, The birds should not be darker 
than golden brown when well cooked. Garnish and serve 
with a salad. 

QUAILS EN COMPOTE (COLD). 

CAILLES EN GEL^E. 

This is another excellent mode of preparing these popular 
birds ; a good dish for luncheon, to be served cold. 



214 GOOD.LIVJNG. 

6 quail. Broth, 

4 cloves, I bay-leaf, 

I clove of garlic, 8 allspice, 

% lady-finger pepper without seeds, , I sprig of thyme, 

Bunch of paisley and celery. Salt, and salt pork. 

Pluck, draw, and clean the birds, wiping with a wet cloth, 
not washing. Tie a piece of salt pork over the breast of 
each one, and truss it as described in Quail Saut6, using 
wooden tooth-picks. Lay the birds, breast upward, in a sauce- 
pan with all the seasonings ; cover with strong, well-flavored 
broth or consomm^. Cover closely, and simmer very gently 
until the birds are very tender, but be careful not to let 
them go to pieces. This will take from 45 minutes to I 
hour, according to the quality of the birds. When cooked, " 
take them out carefully with the skimmer ; remove the pork ; 
lay them in a deep bowl and cover the bowl with a plate. 
Boil down the broth until there is just about enough to cover 
the birds in the bowl. Strain it. Add salt and pepper, if 
necessary ; pour it over the birds and set away to get cold. 
If any broth remains, pour it into a shallow dish and set 
away to harden. When the jelly has hardened, take the 
birds out of the bowl separately with whatever jelly may 
cling to them. Dish them in a pyramid ; heap the jelly and 
that in the extra dish over them ; it should be crumbed with 
a fork, if quite firm. Garnish with sprigs of parsley and 
sliced lemon. Serve with a salad. This is really a, most 
delicious dish, pleasing to both eye and palate, and so easy 
to make that it is strange it is not more often used to take 
the place of the conventional roast quail, whose only varia- 
tion is that it is sometimes well and sometimes ill-cooked. 

Partridges may also be prepared as above. 

SQUABS OR PIGEONS ROASTED. 

PIGEONS RCtIS. 

For this purpose, squabs are best. If you use full-grown 
pigeons, be careful to select only tender ones. 



SQUABS OR PIGEONS BROILED. 21$ 

Pluck, draw, and clean, wiping with a wet cloth, not wash- 
ing them. Truss neatly, using wooden tooth-picks to skewer 
the wings and legs in place : one passed through the two wings 
and body, another passed through the two legs and body. 
If the pigeons are too large for this, tie them in place. 
Fasten a slice of fat pork over each breast. Put a bit of 
butter the size of a hickory-nut in each bird. Some authori- 
ties recommend also to put in i or 2 cranberries. Lay 
the pigeons in a roasting-pan with i tablespoonful of butter 
and 2 of boiling water. The oven should be quite hot, but 
not scorching. Baste frequently, and roast for about 15 
minutes, according to size. Remove the fat pork and serve 
on toast moistened with the butter from the pan and a little 
strong broth. Pigeons, like all dark-fleshed game, should be 
served under-done. 

SQUABS OR PIGEONS BROILED. 
PIGEONS GRILLES. * 

Pluck, draw, clean, and wipe inside and out with a wet 
cloth ; do not wash them ; split and spread open like broiled 
chicken. Have the gridiron heated very hot ;' grease it ; lay 
the pigeon on the gridiron with the inner (or bone) side 
toward the coals. Broil, if possible, under the grate, and 
have the fire very clear ; nothing so destroys the sweetness 
of a good broil as the coal-gas which rises, often unavoidably, 
if the broiler is set over the fire. Rub the birds with melted 
butter. Set a pan below to catch it and the juices. Prepare 
a piece of toast for each bird : trim the crusts from the edges, 
and when the birds have broiled 10 minutes on the inner, 
and 5 on the outer side, moisten the toast with the butter in 
the pan ; add a little good broth ; place the squabs on the 
toast ; sprinkle with salt and pepper ; garnish with cresses 
and serve. If the fire is very intense, three minutes on the 
breast-side may suffice. You can ascertain when they are 
done by pressing the meat with the flat side of a fork ; if it 
is slightly elastic under pressure, it is sufficiently cooked. 



2 1 6 GOOD-UVING. 

Never pierce game (or indeed any meat) with a fork to see 
if it is cooked ; pressing it, as described, will teach you 
very quickly to ascertain when it is sufficiently done. If it 
is to be cooked thoroughly all through, as in the case of 
white-fleshed game, the meat should feel quite firm under 
pressure ; to be underdone, as for dark-fleshed game, it 
should feel elastic, more or less so according to the degree 
of redness required. 

PIGEONS STEWED IN CONSOMMA. 

COMPOTE DE PIGEONS. 

6 pigeons, Consomme or good broth, 

I sliced carrot, 6 slices of bacon or salt pork, 

I " onion, 3 cloves, 

Sprig of parsley, i teaspoon of sugar, 

^ tablespoon of vinegar. 

If you are not certain that your pigeons are tender, the 
following mode of cooking will insure their being good eat- 
ing. Pluck, draw, and clean, wiping inside and out with a 
wet cloth — not washing. Tie them neatly in shape with a 
slice of bacon or pork over the breast of each. Lay them, 
breast uppermost, in a saucepan in which you have put 2 or 
3 slices of bacon. Fry the vegetables in butter. When 
brown, not burnt, add them with the seasonings, salt, and 
pepper. Cover with stock, and set in one corner of the 
range where they will simmer very gently. Add stock, if it 
steams away. Let them simmer -most gently until tender ; 
how long that may be will depend entirely upon the tough- 
ness of the pigeons — anywhere from i hour to 2 hours and 
30 minutes, or even more. Be careful that they do not go 
to pieces ; to this end watch them very carefully after i hour 
has elapsed. Place each pigeon upon a piece of toast trimmed 
around the edges. Put the vegetables around. Strain and 
boil down the gravy rapidly for a few minutes. Pour over 
the pigeons, and serve. Excellent. 



•' FOUR-AND-TWENTY BLACKBIRDS BAKED JN A PIE." 217 
AN ENGLISH PIGEON-PIE. 

l}i pounds of rump steak, 3 pigeons, 

3 slices of ham, 2 ounces of butter, 

4 eggs, boiled hard, Pinch of powdered mace. 
Salt and pepper to taste. Puff paste. 

Pound the steak ; remove the skin and fibres, and cut it in 
pieces 3x3 inches. With these line the bottom of the pie- 
dish. Season with pepper, salt, and a pinch of mace. Clean 
and truss the pigeons ; rub them inside with salt and pepper, 
and put into the body of each J ounce of butter. Lay them 
on the steak. Lay a slice of ham on each pigeon. Add the 
yolks of eggs, and also the whites, sliced, if liked. Fill the 
dish with stock, which may be thickened with a Brown Roux 
(see receipt). Add a few balls of good force-meat, and also 
a few small dice of the paste. Edge the dish with a band 
of paste ; cover it with the same ; notch the edges together 
and trim them. Clean 3 of the pigeons' feet ; stick these, 
claws upward, in the middle of the top, to show what manner 
of pie it is. Set in a moderately-quick oven for about i 
hour. Watch that it does not bake unevenly. Then draw 
it out ; brush the surface with the yolk of an egg beaten with 
a few drops of milk, and return to the oven for about 5 
minutes more, until nicely browned. Eat hot or cold — the 
latter is best. N. B. — Use Flaky Crust or Puff Paste for the 
above (see receipts). 

"FOUR-AND-TWENTY BLACKBIRDS BAKED IN A 

PIE." 

First make your crust, Plain Paste or Flaky Crust (see 
receipts), and set it away. Put into a saucepan and boil for 
30 minutes the following ingredients : 

I quart of broth, 2 onions, chopped. 

Bunch of parsley and celery leaves. Salt and pepper, 

^ pound of ham, cut in pieces, 6 cloves and 10 allspice. 

When the sauce has boiled as directed, put in 24 black- 
birds, which have been previously cleaned. Simmer 20 



2I8 GOOD-LIVING. 

minutes or more, until tender. Be careful that they do not 
go to pieces. Put a border of paste on your pie-dish. Re- 
move the birds and place them in the dish. Slice 2 hard- 
boiled eggs into the dish, also half a lemon (rejecting the 
pips) ; add i gill of sherry. Strain off the broth, picking out 
the pieces of ham and some of the onion, parsley, and celery, 
which also put into the dish. Return the broth to the fire. 
Make a roux of i tablespoonful each of butter and flour, the 
latter heaping. Stir together over the fire until of a rich 
brown ; do not burn. Remove from the fire ; stir in the 
boiling broth by degrees, and blend until perfectly smooth. 
Strain the sauce and fill the pie-dish. If any is left, set it 
aside until the pie is baked. Now roll out the top crust 
rather more than half an inch thick ; lay an extra layer of 
paste on the edge of the dish ; moisten the edge ; put on 
the cover ; press the edges together ; notch and trim neatly. 
Cut an X in the middle of the crust ; place a twist of paper 
in the hole to keep it open. Bake the pie about 25 minutes 
in a quick oven. Bake on a separate tin a rose or leaf of 
paste with which to cover the hole in the pie. When it is 
nearly done, draw the pie out, brush the top with yolk of egg 
beaten with a little milk ; set it back in the oven, and bake 
about 5 minutes longer until nicely browned. Remove 
from the oven ; take out the paper and pour in the extra 
sauce through the hole. Put the fancy crust over the hole, 
and serve. It is better eaten cold. 

Veal and ham pie may be made in the same way, using f 
veal to \ ham, 

BARBECUED HARE OR RABBIT. 

LAPIN OU LifeVRE r6tI. 

Skin the rabbit and chop off the feet. Leave the head 
on, skinning and cleaning it nicely. Empty it, and wipe the 
inside with a wet cloth, drying immediately. Skewer the 
fore- and hind-legs forward as if lying down. Lay it in a 
roasting-pan, with i tablespoonful of butter and 3 of boiling 



STEWED RABBIT OR HARE AU CHASSEUR. 219 

water. Be very generous with the butter. Add salt and 
pepper. Cover air-tight with an -inverted roasting-pan, to 
keep in the steam. Set in a hot oven. In about 10 minutes, 
baste with the butter very thoroughly, and Cover again. 
Repeat this process every 10 minutes until the hare has been 
in the oven about 30 minutes, then, if the flesh feels almost 
firm under pressure, leave off the top pan, baste again, and 
return to the oven until nicely browned. It will take from 
30 to 45 minutes in all, according to the size of the rabbit or 
hare. Do not let the surface brown too much or dry. Gar- 
nish with cresses ; sprinkle with salt and pepper ; pour the 
pan-gravy over it, and serve with Maitre de H6tel Butter. 
Put a frill of cut paper over the bone of each leg. 

STEWED RABBIT OR HARE AU CHASSEUR. 

LAPIN OU LifeVRE AU CHASSEUR. 

I i-abbit or hare, I gill of sherry, 

I pint of boiling water, I heaping tablespoon of flour, 

I onion, cut fine, 2 tablespoons of butter, 

6 cloves and 12 allspice, i bay-leaf, 

24 small white onions, i tablespoon of vinegar, 

Pepper and salt. 

Skin and clean the rabbit. Wipe with a damp cloth ; do 
not soak it in water. Leave the rabbit whole, or disjoint it, 
as preferred. The latter is recommended. Put one table- 
spoonful of butter into a large frying-pan. When the butter 
is melted, lay in the rabbit ; turn and brown on all sides, not 
too dark. Then put it into an iron pot which has been 
heating, meanwhile, on the side of the range. When the 
rabbit is all browned, put the onion into the pan and fry 
very brown, but do not burn. Add this to the pot. Now 
put into the frying-pan the rest of the butter with the flour, 
and stir until well browned, but not burned ; draw aside and 
add by degrees i pint of boiling water, stirring all the time. 
Pour this over the rabbit. Now add enough boiling water 
to half cover the rabbit. Add all the other seasonings; 
close the lid tightly and set where it will simmer very gently 



220 GOOD-LIVING. 

for 45 minutes to i hour. This will suffice if the rabbit is 
young and tender ; if not, cook longer, watching that it does 
not go to pieces. Meanwhile peel the onions in water. Put 
them in a saucepan with salted boiling water and boil about 
I hour, perhaps less, if quite small. When you can pierce 
them very easily with a skewer, drain them. Now remove 
the rabbit from the pot ; arrange it neatly on a hot dish ; 
strain the gravy ; return it to the fire, and let it boil down 
briskly for a few minutes. Now arrange the onions all 
around the rabbit. There should be enough to make a con- 
tinuous row like large white beads. If the sauce is not 
quite thick enough by this time, add a pinch of corn-starch 
blended with a few drops of cold water; stir it into the 
boiling gravy ; boil three minutes ; add the wine ; pour the 
sauce over the rabbit, not over the onions, and serve. 
Recommended.

POTTED HARE OR RABBIT. 

Lli:VRE OU LAPIN EN COMPOTE. 

Skin, clean, and joint the hare or rabbit, and prepare 
according to the receipt for Pigeons en Compote. 

SADDLE OF VENISON. 

SELLE DE CHEVREUIL. 

Should be roasted exactly the same as a Saddle of Mutton, 
allowing 9 or 10 minutes to the pound (see receipt). Saddle 
of venison should always be served very under-done. Put a 
frill of cut paper on the tail; garnish tastefully and serve 
with currant jelly and a salad. The plates on which the 
venison is served should be very hot. 

HAUNCH OF VENISON NO. I. 
CUISSOT DE CHEVREUIL I. 

Roast exactly like a leg of mutton, covering with a second 
pan and basting frequently with melted butter. Allow about 



VENISON STEAK NO II. 221 

lO minutes to the pound in a hot oven. Venison should, 
always be served juicy and under-done. Serve with a Jelly 
Sauce (see receipt), or with its own juices, currant jelly 
being handed at the same time. Put a frill of cut paper on 
the bone ; garnish and serve with a salad. 

HAUNCH OF VENISON NO. II. 

CUISSOT DE CHEVREUIL 11. 

Make a large sheet of coarse paste — that is, mix together 
a little lard, flour, and enough cold water to make a paste ; 
roll the leg in this, covering every part, and put it in the 
roasting-pan in the oven. It requires no basting. Allow 
the same time, about lo minutes to the pound. Before 
serving, break off the crust. Put a frill around the bone; 
garnish and serve with Jelly Sauce (see receipt). 

BROILED VENISON STEAK NO. I. 

Cut slices from the leg and broil them over a quick, clear 
fire, turning constantly. Steaks i inch thick will not require 
more than 8 to lo minutes, as they must be served very 
under-done. When done, butter both sides ; sprinkle with 
salt and pepper ; garnish and serve alone, or with Jelly 
Sauce. 

VENISON STEAK NO. II. 

Cut slices |- of an inch thick from the leg. Cut these into 
even pieces about 3x3 inches. Prepare a Jelly Sauce (see 
receipt) in a saucepan on the side of the range. Have the 
fire very clear and hot. Heat the broiler. Lay the little 
steaks on it. Turn very often. In 8 minutes, or less, they 
will be sufficiently cooked. Drop them into the sauce ; let 
them stand well covered by the same for 5 or 10 minutes ; 
keep hot, but on no account let them cook. Serve on a 
very hot dish, in a circle, one overlapping the other. Pour 
the sauce over ; garnish, and serve.

VENISON IN A CHAFING DISH. 

Cold sliced venison, Butter, the size of a walnut, 

S gills of cooking-sherry or one of port, i gill of currant or grape jelly, 

}i teaspoon of corn-starch. Pepper and salt. 

The meat should be very tender, underdone, and cut in 
thick slices. Or you can have a steak cut into pieces, 2x2 
inches, and slightly broiled, and add these to the sauce 2 
minutes before serving. Make the sauce as follows : Melt 
the butter in the chafing-dish ; add the Jelly ; let it dissolve 
entirely ; then add the port wine and about i gill of boiling 
water, pepper and salt to taste. When it boils, stir in the 
corn-starch blended with a little cold water. Stir and boil 
I minute. Add the pieces of cold or broiled venison ; turn 
them in the sauce and heat for 2 minutes, then serve. The 
meat should be kept well covered with the sauce while heat- 
ing. This is an excellent old-fashioned dish for luncheon. 

VENISON STEW. 

ragoOt de chevreuil. 

Follow the directions for Stewed Beef with Brown 
Gravy, cutting the venison in pieces ; add to the sauce 
when done a gill of wine, a good pinch of cayenne, and the 
juice of half a lemon. Before adding the wine remove the 
meat to a hot dish. Make some Dumplings (see receipts) ; 
drop them in small balls into the boiling sauce. Cover and 
boil briskly for 10 minutes. Dish the dumplings around the 
meat ; strain the sauce ; season as above ; pour it over the 
meat and serve. The above may be made with any rough 
bits of venison, or from the remnants of haunch or saddle 
already cooked, if under-done. Use claret or port wine in 
preference to sherry for the sauce. 

VENISON PASTY. 

Follow the directions for Four-and-Twenty Blackbird 
Pie, in all details, cutting the meat in pieces. Add dice of 



GAME pAt& JELLIED. 223 

boiled pork, hard-boiled eggs, and wine. When baked, fill 
the pie through the top opening with gravy. It will require 
about I hour in a moderate oven. Finish and serve as 
directed. It is best eaten cold, i or 2 days after it is made. ' 
I gill of port wine and a squeeze of lemon-juice added to 
the gravy will be found a further improvement, but is not 
indispensable.

Having stewed the partridges or rabbits, the latter cut in 
pieces, save the breasts of the partridges removed in large 
pieces from the carcass ; pick off all the rest of the meat 
from the bones and chop it very fine by the Enterprise 
Chopper. Chop also the sausage-meat, salt pork, and any 
livers of game or poultry that you may have. A little piece 
of calf's liver, scalded until firm, may replace these last. 
Take \, or rather less, of the bulk of all these in stale bread- 
crumbs. Put the bones of the partridges, garlic, spices, 
stock, etc., to boil, and finish as directed for Chicken P4t^

Boil the macaroni in salted boiling water for about 25 min- 
utes, until tender. Drain. Cut it in pieces i inch long. Mix 
the bread-crumbs and ham well ; then add stock, seasonings 
and sauces. Mix ; add the egg well beaten. Grease a plain 
mould that has a cover. Line the mould with the macaroni ; 
fill with the mixture ; press closely. Put on the lid ; fasten 
it firmly. Stand the mould in a kettle of boiling water deep 
enough to f cover it. Cover the kettle. Boil i hour. When 
done, turn it from the mould, and serve with Bechamel Sauce

butter and flour in a frying-pan over the fire until well 
browned but not burned ; remove from the fire and stir in 
enough of the boiling tomato-juice to blend it. 'Pour 
this into the stewpan of tomatoes ; stir until perfectly 
smooth ; add the ham, and boil about 10 minutes. Mean 
while, boil the macaroni briskly in salted boiling water fot 
about 20 minutes. When quite tender, drain it thoroughly ; 
add it to the sauce, and set the saucepan where it will stew 
gently, without actually boiling, for 20 minutes or more ; the 
macaroni must be thoroughly saturated with the sauce. It 
scorches easily, therefore watch it. Serve in a deep dish and 
hand at the same time grated cheese, Parmesan and Gruyfere 
mixed. 

BOILED MACARONI. 

% pound of macaroni, 2 tablespoons of flour, 

Salt and pepper, i tablespoon of butter. 

Fill a 3-quart kettle with boiling water ; add salt. Hold 
the macaroni in a bunch over the kettle with the ends in the 
boiling water ; as they soften, introduce tlje macaroni by 
degrees into the boiling water. This is the correct way to 
preserve the length of the macaroni, not breaking it. Boil 
rapidly for 25 minutes ; when perfectly tender, drain it in the 
colander. Put in the kettle i pint of fresh boiling water, salt 
and pepper. Rub together flour and butter until umooth ; 
blend with the boiling water ; stir until perfectly smooth ; 
then add the macaroni to the sauce ; boil 3 minutes, and 
serve in a deep dish. Serve grated cheese separately. Or

Parmesan cheese. Now put the macaroni into a fire-proof 
bake-dish. Then pour the boiling milk by degrees upon the 
egg and cheese, kirring rapidly. Pour the milk, egg, and 
cheese over the macaroni. It should quite cover the latter; 
if not, add a little more plain, hot milk. Sprinkle grated 
cheese over the top, and set in a moderately-quick oven 20 
to 30 minutes. The top should be of a rich brown. 

VOL-A U-VENT BOURGEOIS. 

3 pairs of calves' brains, 6 sausages, 

100 small oysters or 50 large, I qt. of White Sauce (see receipt), 

X gill of sherry, Celery-salt and cayenne, 

I level teaspoon of curry-powder. Salt. 

Parboil the brains ; cut them in square pieces. Fry the 
sausages until half cooked ; cut them in slices across. Scald 
the oysters in their own juice for 3 minutes. Now strain 
this juice and use it, in making the sauce, to blend the flour 
and butter, eking out the amount required with boiling 
water. Stir in the seasonings. Taste to see that the curry 
does not predominate, and that there is sufficient celery-salt 
and wine. If these seasonings are judiciously used, the com- 
bination is delicious. Line a deep pie-dish with Puff Paste 
or with Flaky Crust (see receipts), making the bottom crust 
thin and building up the edges with 2 or 3 extra layers. Fill

this with the oysters, brains, and sausages ; cover with the 
sauce. Roll the top Ciust f of an inch thick ; cover the pie ; 
moisten the edges to keep them together ; notch and trim 
them neatly ; make a x cut in the centre. Bake in a mod- 
erately-quick oven 20 to 30 minutes, watching carefully that 
it does not scorch. Draw it to the mouth of the oven; 
brush over with yolk of egg beaten with milk ; return to the 
oven for 2 or 3 minutes until browned. Bake on a separate 
tin a piece of crust in some fancy shape, and place it over the 
X cut in the pie. Use, if possible, a dish that can stand 
inside of a fancy cover ; if not, fold a table-napkin neatly, 
diagonally, the width of the dish, and pin it around. This 
is a very simple dish, but delicious. 

CHICKEN AND OYSTER PIE. 

Cold boiled chicken, i qt. of White Sauce (see receipt), 

100 small oysters or 50 large, I grated onion, 

1 slice of cold ham, cut in dice, i gill of sherry. 

Pepper, celery-salt, Cayenne and salt. 

Cut the meat from the chicken in even, neat pieces. Scald 
the oysters in their own juice. Make a sauce according to 
receipt (White Sauce), using the strained oyster-juice to 
blend it, eking out the necessary quantity with boiling water. 
Add to the sauce the grated onion and seasonings (see 
Vol-au-vent Bourgeois). Make a Puff Paste or Flaky Crust ; 
line a deep pie-dish with a thin layer of paste, building up 
the edges with 2 or 3 extra layers. Fill the dish with the 
chicken, oysters, and ham. Pour the sauce over all. Cover 
with paste rolled f of an inch thick. Moisten the edges to 
keep them together ; notch and trim them neatly ; put an x 
cut in the centre. Bake on a separate tin a small piece of 
crust, cut in some fancy shape, wherewith to cover the hole in 
the pie. Bake the pie for about 30 minutes in a moderately- 
quick oven, watching that it browns evenly. Draw it to the 
mouth of the oven ; brush the top with egg-yolk and milk, 
and return to the oven for 2 or 3 minutes until browned. 
Use a dish that can be stood in a fancy cover ; if not, pin a 
folded napkin neatly aroundit. Serve hot.

PHILADELPHIA CHICKEN AND SWEETBREAD 
CROQUETTES. 

t chicken, about 4 pounds, i small onion, 

I bay-leaf, i pair of sweetbreads, 

4 whole cloves, i sprig of parsley, salt. 

Singe, draw, and clean the chicken. Put it into a pot with 
cloves, bay-leaf, onion, parsley, and enough cold water to 
cover. Put on the lid and simmer gently until very tender, 
I hour and 30 minutes or more, according to age. Having 
prepared the sweetbreads (see directions), trim off all fat, 
fibres and strings ; cut very fine with a silver knife. When 
the chicken is tender, remove skin and bones and return 
them to the soup-pot to simmer again. This liquor may be 
used for soup. Chop the meat very fine (with an Enterprise 
Chopper if you have it) ; mix with the sweetbreads, and to 
every pint of this meat allow : 

2 gills of milk or cream, i large tablespoon of butter, 

I teaspoon of grated onion, 2 tablespoons of flour, 

I " " salt, I tablespoon of chopped parsley, 

^ " " grated nutmeg, Cayenne and pepper to taste. 

Put the milk to boil in a farina-kettle. Rub together the 
flour and butter to a smooth paste over the fire, but do not 
brown ; then stir into them the boiling milk. Stir until very 
thick. Remove from the fire ; add meat and seasonings, and 
mix well. Taste to see if the seasonings are good. Turn 
out on a flat dish to cool. When cold and firm, form into 
cone-shaped croquettes (there are moulds for the purpose) or 
cylindrical, i x 2^ inches. The latter are easier for a novice. 
Have at hand a plate of flour, a plate of raw eggs, and 
a bowl of sifted bread-crumbs. Flour your hands well ; 
take up a tablespoonful of the mixture, mould it into shape ; 
roll it over in the egg, drop it into the bowl of crumbs ; cover 
every part with these. Correct the shape if necessary, and 
lay them on a flat dish. The air must reach all sides. Set 
away in the ice-box for at least i hour. Then fry in deep 
lard until golden brown. The lard should be deep enough 
to entirely cover the croquettes. Use a frying-basket (see 



BOUChAes k LA HEINE, ETC. 229 

General Directions for Frying). When golden brown, lay 
them on paper in the mouth of the oven. When dry, serve 
on a folded napkin or cut paper with fresh or Fried Parsley 
(see receipt). 

N. B. — The whole success of croquettes depends upon 
having the lard hot enough ; if it is not just right, they will 
be spoiled. Pieces of cold chicken or turkey may be used, 
and brains substituted for the sweetbreads. 

RISSOLES. 

3 gills of cold meat, cut in small dice, Parsley, chopped, 
I gill of chopped pork or ham, Mushrooms, 

4 tablespoons of gravy or water, i egg, 

I level tablespoon of flour, i teaspoon of butter. 

Stir the flour and butter in a saucepan over the fire until 
blended ; then add the gravy, broth or boiling water ; stir 
smooth. Boil 2 minutes. Then stir in the meat and season- 
ings ; bring to boiling point ; remove from the fire, and stir 
in very briskly the egg which has been beaten until mixed. 
Do not let it cook again. Set away to cool. Make a thin 
sheet of Puff Paste or Flaky Crust (see receipts). Wet it 
for about 3 inches from the edge, and place upon \ the 
sheet little heaps of the prepared meat, about 4 inches 
apart. Double over the paste, covering the heaps. Press 
the side of the hand between each, pressing the paste to- 
gether close to the heaps. Then with a biscuit-cutter, or with 
a tumbler, cut out each heap in a circle or half-moon. Brush 
the top with egg ; bake in a quick oven, or fry in hot butter. 
The egg may be omitted from the force-meat. Serve in a 
pyramid on cut paper or a folded napkin, garnished with 
parsley. 

bouch£es a la reine, etc. 

Heat shells of puff-paste thoroughly and fill with chicken 
(see Chicken en Caisses). Other bouch^es may be filled with 
Devilled Scallops (see receipts), sweetbreads (see Sweet- 
breads en Casseroles, or Sweetbreads with Mushrooms); 
or with stewed oysters (see Stewed Oysters for P4t6s), etc.

I quart of pieces of cold meat, Salt to taste. 

% teaspoon of ground cloves, i cup of boiling veal stock, 

I " " allspice, ^ teaspoon of ground cinnamon," 

% " " mace, ^ " " black pepper. 

Use for the purpose some stock that will jelly. If you are 
not confident of what you have, either boil it down to at 
least dbuble its strength, or else add to the boiling liquid i 
teaspoonful of gelatine dissolved in cold water. Mix well all 
the ingredients.- Press the mixture into a mould that has 
been rinsed in cold water ; set away to cool and harden. 
Use some such combination as veal and ham, chicken and 
ham, or even bouilli, with i or 2 hard-boiled eggs. When 
hard, loosen the edges with a knife, turn out the form on 
a dish, and serve with salad. 

The various forms of these Meat Loaves cannot be too 
strongly recommended for savoriness and economy. They 
keep very well, and serve admirably for luncheon, or with 
salad for dinner (see various receipts). 

VOL-AV-VENT. 

Have the pastry-cook make the vol-au-vent .crust ; it is 
such a troublesome piece of work that it cannot be recom- 
mended for home manufacture. Heat the empty shell very 
hot, and fill it with Sweetbreads with Mushrooms (see re- 
ceipt), to which add 2 gills or more of Quenelles (see receipt) ; 
or fill with the mixture for Sweetbreads en Casseroles (see 
receipt), to which add quenelles as above ; or fill with 
Chicken Saut6 with Mushrooms (see receipt), to which add 
wine, truffles, quenelles, and, if liked, cocks'-combs. These 
last may be had of any first-class grocer. Or the vol-au-vent 
may have the same filling as that used in receipt for Vol-au- 
vent Bourgeois, or Chicken and Oyster Pie; or, again, fill 
with Oysters Stewed k la Poulette, or Oysters for Pat6s 
(see receipts).

SCALLOPED TOMATOES WITH MEAT. 

t cup of cold meat, chopped, I cup of bread-crumbs, 

r large tablespoon of chopped parsley, Cayenne, 

y^ grated onion, Pepper and salt, 

Tomatoes, fresh or canned. Butter. 

Use cold mutton, lamb, veal, or chicken, in fact almost 
any meat. Mince the cold meat quite fine; add to it an 
equal bulk of stale bread, the parsley, onion, pepper, salt, and 
a good pinch of cayenne. Line the sides of a bake-dish with 
peeled tomatoes cut in halves. Fill the dish with the meat ; 
lay over this a thick layer of tomatoes cut in thick slices or 
halves ; sprinkle with bread-crumbs, pepper, and salt ; dot the 
top with butter, and set in the oven for about 45 to 60 min- 
utes. If canned tomatoes are used, drain thoroughly. 



STUFFED CABBAGE. 

CHOUX FARCIS. 

For this, select a nice head of Savoy cabbage. Cover it 
with boiling water ; set aside 1 5 minutes, then drain. Scald 
cigain ; let stand 30 minutes, then drain dry. Make the stuf- 
fing as follows : 

2 heaping tablespoons of washed rice, ^ pound of sausage-meat, 

I tablespoon of grated onion, I tablespoon of chopped parsley. 

Mix all well together. Open the cabbage carefully to the 
very centre ; put in \ teaspoon of the mixture ; fold over this 
2 or 3 of the small leaves ; cover these again with a layer of the 
force-meat ; fold over this the next layer of leaves, and so on 
until each layer receives its share of force-meat. Press all firmly 
together ; tie in a piece of cheese-cloth ; put it into a kettle of 
salted boiling water, and boil two hours. When done, care- 
fully remove the cloth, and serve the cabbage in a deep 
round dish with a Cream Sauce (see receipt) poured over it.

stuff it with a force-meat of mutton, veal, or sausage-meat 
(see Force-meat) ; cover \ with stock and red wine, and stew 
it for 3 or 4 hours until perfectly tender. It must simmer 
very gently. Dish the cabbage on a round dish; set the 
sauce again on the fire and boil it down briskly for a few 
minutes, then stir in a little corn-starch blended with cold 
water ; boil 3 minutes, stirring constantly ; strain, and pour 
over the cabbage. 

N. B. — The cabbage must be kept covered air-tight while 
cooking.

Cut the meat in dice. Beat the milk into the egg ; stir 
these into the flour ; beat well ; add seasonings and meat ; put 
into a buttered baking-dish. Bake i hour. Serve in the same 
dish. 



FORCE-MEATS, GARNISHES, ETC. 
QUENELLES. 

I pound of lean veal from the leg, poultry, or game, 6 ounces of butter, 

1 pound of bread-crumbs, l ounce of butter, 

2 tablespoons of rich Cream Sauce, Pinch of salt and pepper, 

5 sggs less 2 whites. 

Pound the veal ; scrape it with a knife ; pound it in a mortar; 
then rub it through a sieve. Steep the inside of a loaf of 
bread for i or 2 minutes in tepid water, then squeeze it quite 
dry. Put the bread in a stewpan with i ounce of butter, and 
stir it over the fire until it ceases to stick to the pan and 
forms a smooth, stiff paste. Add a pinch of salt. Remove 
it from the fire, and set it away to cool between 2 plates. 
When cold, put 12 ounces of the prepared veal, 6 ounces of 
fresh butter, and 8 ounces of the bread-panada into a mortar 
and pound well together ; break in, one by one, 3 whole eggs ; 
mix well ; add 2 more yolks of eggs and the Cream Sauce 
(see receipt). Season with pepper and salt and a pinch of 
mace to taste. When the force-meat has been pounded to a 
smooth, even paste, put it away in a bowl to cool, and it is 
ready for use. To cook it, have ready a saucepan of salted 
boiling water ; take up the meat between 2 tablespoons ; 
smooth it in good shape, and drop it into the boiling water. 
Test some first. If the quenelles are too soft, add more egg ; 
if too hard, more bread-panada or sauce. These large ones 
may be served in a circle with a sauce of mushrooms or 
truffles ; or the force-meat may be poached in small alnjond- 
shaped pieces or balls and served in clear soup. Quenelles 
are also very useful as a garnish for Vol-au-Vents, etc. (see 
receipts).

SO YEN'S RECEIPT FOR QUENELLES. 

l}4 pounds of fillet of veal, 4 eggs, 

6 ounces of panada, I pound of fresh beef suet, 

X teaspoon of pepper, I teaspoon of salt, 

yi teaspoon grated nutmeg. 

Cut the veal into long, thin slices ; scrape with a knife until 
nothing remains but fibre ; put it into a mortar and pound 10 
minutes, or until it becomes of the consistency of a pur6e ; 
pass it through a wire sieve (the piece which is left can be 
put in the soup-pot). Skin, shred, and chop the suet very 
fine ; put it into the mortar and pound it. Add the panada 
(that is, the crumb of bread soaked in milk and boiled until 
nearly dry) to the suet ; pound them well together. Add 
the veal.- Add seasonings. Work all well together. Add 
then, I at a time, the 4 eggs, continually pounding the con- 
tents of the mortar. When well mixed, take a small piece in 
a spoon and poach it in salted boiling water ; if it is delicate, 
firm, and of a good flavor, it is ready for use. N. B. — If too 
soft, add another yolk of egg ; if too firm, add a little cream 
or stock. The flavor may be varied by making up the 
weight of veal by a small proportion of ham ; i or 2 mush- 
rooms may also be used. The essential point is to pound 
the mixture unsparingly ; the more it is pounded the finer 
and more delicate will be the quenelles. 

FISH QUENELLES. 

QUENELLES DE POISSON. 

y( pound of bread-panada, Pepper, 

t pound of flesh of any fine fish, Salt, 

2 eggs, I X pound of butter. 

Rub the fish, freed from skin and bone, through a sieve. 
Prepare the bread-panada (see Quenelles). Mix with it the 
butter and fish ; season with pepper, salt, and a pinch of nut- 
meg or mace, and pound in the mortar. Mix in the eggs, i 
at a time ; moisten with a little Fish-broth (see receipt), and 
pound all together until it becomes a smooth paste. Poach 



FORCE-MEAT BALLS NO. n. 235 

as directed, using fish-stock instead of plain boiling water. 
Serve large quenelles as an entree, with Lobster or Shrimp 
Sauce (see receipts), or as a garnish. Test a piece of the force- 
meat in the boiling broth ; if too soft, add an egg; if too 
firm, add a little more fish-stock and panada. 

EGG BALLS. 

6 hard-boiled eggs, Pinch of flour, 

2 yolks of raw eggs, Salt to taste. 

Pound the hard-boiled yolks of eggs until perfectly smooth 
in a mortar or bowl. Beat the raw yolks. Add them, with 
the flour and salt, to the cooked eggs. Mix all together and 
roll into balls the size of hickory-nuts. Have ready a sauce- 
pan of salted boiling water ; drop the balls into it and boil 
until firm, about 5 minutes.

Arrow-root, corn-starch, sago, tapioca, rice. 
Mixed vegetables, sliced fine, and stewed in butter. 
For a light-bodied soup, a few spoonfuls of stewed tomatoes. 

CROtJTONS NO. I. 

Slice some stale bread. Remove the crust. Cut in small dice. 
Heat some butter in a pan on the fire. When it is boiling, 
drop in the bread. Shake frequently till light golden-brown. 
The butter should nearly cover the bread. When done, in 
about I minute, remove with a skimmer to brown paper in 
the open mouth of the oven. When dry, serve on a cut 
paper at the same time with tomato soup or any other pur^e. 

CROl>TONS NO. 11. 

Proceed as above, using lard instead of butter. Let the 
lard entirely cover the toasts. They will not require more 
than I or 2 minutes. When pale-yellow, skim out, dry, and 
serve as above. These are much prettier in color than the 
croutons fried in butter. N, B. — The lard must be boiling.

FANCY CRO&TONS. 

Cut stale bread into thin ^inch slices ; stamp out any 
shape, according to fancy — diamonds, rings, etc., etc. Fry 
these as directed for Croutons No. 2, and use as a garnish 
for minces, ragouts, stewed kidneys, sweetbreads, fish, etc., 
etc. To make a border of these croutons, dip one side of 
each in white-of-egg mixed with a pinch of flour, to make it 
adhere to the edge of the dish, and arrange them one next 
to the other, according to taste. These croutons for gar- 
nishing may also be cut in cubes i^ inches by 2^ inches long. 

FRIED BREAD-CRUMBS FOR GAME, ETC. 

Cut the bread into thin slices ; place these in a cool oven 
with the door open overnight, if you have time. ^ When 
thoroughly dry and crisp, but not brown, roll them to a fine 
crumb. Bring some lard gradually to a boil in the frying- 
pan. When you are sure it is boiling (see General Directions 
for Frying), throw in the crumbs, and fry quickly till golden- 
brown. Do not let them darken or burn. When done, skim 
out on a sieve ; set in the open oven, and when dry, serve. 
Very nice to serve in small heaps around grouse or other 
game.

Salt and pepper, 2 whites of eggs. 

Grated nutmeg, Cliopped parsley. 

Mix all together with cold water enough to make a firm 
paste. Flour the board and roll very thin. Roll this paste 
up like a sheet of music. Now cut it in strips \ of an inch 
wide. Flour these to prevent sticking together. Drop a 
few at a time into salted boiling water or boiling broth. 
Cook 30 minutes. Drain and add to the soup.

GERMAN NOODLES. 

2 eggs, Flour for paste. 

Beat the eggs well and work in flour to make a firm paste ; 
knead well ; divide into two parts. Roll each but thin and 
leave it to dry for a little while without hardening. Roll it 
up and cut into small pieces the size of a large pea. Scatter 
them in boiling salted water. When done through, drain 
and throw into your boiling soup. Simmer for 1 5 minutes. 

SWEDISH NOODLES. 

Beat up I egg with a pinch of salt until it froths ; then 
work in as much sifted flour as it will take up (about 3 table- 
spoonfuls). Knead it until it becomes a firm, smooth, elastic 
paste. Then roll it out on a slightly floured board until as 
thin as writing-paper. When it is as thin as possible, slip 
under the sheet of paste a smooth, slightly- floured cloth. 
Cover the paste likewise. This enables you to roll it still 
thinner. Now cut the paste into rounds witH a thimble or 
something equally small. The paste should be folded, so 
that 2 discs may be cut at a time. Have ready on the fire 
a saucepan of deep boiling lard. When you are certain that 
it is boiling, drop in the discs of paste. They will immedi- 
ately swell into golden balls, requiring not more than a 
minute to color. Skim them out; drain on brown paper, 
and add to the soup.

SAUSAGE DRESSING FOR TURKEY. 

The liver of the turkey, sausage-meat, parsley, chives, salt, 
pepper, and pork minced fine. Truffles are a great addition 
to this last. 

FRIED PARSLEY. 

Parsley, Lard or sweet drippings. 

Wash, pick, and thoroughly dry handsome, full sprigs of 
parsley. Bring the lard to a boil. Test it to be certain that 
it is ready (see General Directions for Frying). Lay the 
parsley in the frying-basket and plunge it for about i minute 
(perhaps less) into the lard, which should be deep enough to 
cover it. It should be crisped without blackening. Remove 
the basket ; drain, and set it before the fire or in the open oven 
for a few minutes to dry. This should always be served in a 
large bunch in the centre of a dish of croquettes, lobster 
chops, fried smelts ; indeed with any thing that is dipped 
and fried. In this way the same lard is used for the parsley 
when the other frying is finished, and is really no trouble. 

TO MIX ENGLISH MUSTARD. 

Mustard floor, Boiling water. 

Vinegar, Salt and sugar. 

Put the mustard in a cup ; pour upon it a few drops of 
boiling water and mix rapidly to a stiff paste. Add a few 
drops of vinegar to thin it ; a good pinch of sugar, and a 
little salt. This will be found to be a decided improvement 
on the usual method of mixing mustard.

GLAZE. 

GLACE. 

Having cleared 2 quarts of Consottimd (see receipt), set it 
in an uncovered stewpan over a brisk fire, and let it boil and 
evaporate until reduced to a sticky and stiff consistency ; stir 
constantly and be careful that it does not blacken, or it will 
become bitter. If wanted to keep on hand, take a larger 
quantity than the above, as it reduces very much, and when 
quite thick and stiff, put it into an earthenware jar which can 
be stood in hot water {pain-marie) when the glaze is required 
for use. Good for glazing hams, tongues, and other large 
pieces of meat. 

N. B. — In making consomm6 for glaze, omit turnips, which 
make it bitter.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 
BROWN ROUX. 

ROUX BRUN. 

t tablespoon of flour, i tablespoon of butter. 

Melt the butter slowly ; sprinkle in the flour and stir it 
over the fire until every particle of the flour is uniformly 
browned. The fire must not be too hot after the first few 
moments. It will require about 25 minutes. Be very careful 
that it does not scorch, as this gives a bitter taste to the 
sauce. The butter must be very good, and there should be 
only just flour enough to absorb the butter. The above 
quantity is sufficient to thicken 2 gills of sauce or i pint of 
soup. The sauce to be thickened should be strong and well 
flavored with herbs, spices, etc., boiled down until very 
savory (such as Consomm6), then strained ; while boiling, it 
should be stirred into the roux which you have drawn aside 
and allowed to cool slightly. Pour it in very gradually, stir- 
ring all the time. Then set the saucepan again where it will 
boil, and boil for 3 or 4 minutes longer, or until the sauce is 
very rich, smooth, and as thick as required. It is of the 
utmost importance to learn the proper mode for putting 
together the different elements of these Mother Sauces 
{Sauces Mires), as the French call the Espagnole, Veloutd, 
Bechamel, and Allemande. They are the foundation of all 
the infinite variety of fancy sauces. Proper attention is not 
paid in our country to the importance of perfecting this

branch of cookery, which is of immense value in many ways, 
and pre-eminently in the matter of domestic economy ; a 
good sauce often helping a very meagre and commonplace 
dish to pass for something quite elegant. 

Of course, it is often necessary to thicken a sauce quickly 
at the time of serving. In this case the proper thing to use 
is corn-starch, arrow-root, or potato-flour rubbed smooth with 
a few drops of cold water, and stirred into the sauce while 
boiling, stirring quickly all the time and boiling for about 3 
minutes, until transparent. In this case the allowance would 
be about 2 medium teaspoonfuls of corn-starch to the pint ; 
it is very easy to gauge the quantity required at the moment. 
The disadvantage of this latter system is, that after a certain 
amount of boiling, or in re-heating, the sauce becomes thin 
again and must be thickened anew. The proper way, there- 
fore, whenever circumstances allow, is to use the roux to 
thicken, and that, if possible, at the beginning of the prepara- 
tion of the sauce (see, for example, directions for Beef k la 
Mode, etc.) where a handsome sauce is required. A dark, 
rich, strong gravy or " jus " (see Brown Gravy) does not 
require thickening. Never under any circumstances allow 
yourself to be tempted to use burnt or browned flour for 
thickening sauces ; it is a relic of barbarism, almost invariably, 
practised by the commonplace Hibernian cook, and every 
good housekeeper should forbid the use , of it. How many 
roast-beef and poultry gravies are rendered bitter and all the 
true flavor ruined by this wretched practice! Study to 
make good sauces, and you will find yourself well repaid by 
the results. 

WHITE ROUX. 
ROUX BLANC. 

The same rule as for Brown Roux is to be followed for 
White Roux, excepting that, although the flour must be 
worked into the butter over the fire, it must not be allowed 
to color, unless it be very slightly for certain sauces, such 



BLENDING FOR SAUCES AND SOUPS. 245 

as the Velout6 or Blonde, which should be pale yellow. The 
White Roux is used for all white sauces, such as Bechamel, 
Cream, etc. The roux, be it White or Brown, may be 
made in larger quantities, and set away in glass or earthen- 
ware jars, where it will keep as much as 6 months in a cool 
place. It can be sprinkled into the boiling sauce, and stirred 
until thick, allowing about one heaping dessert-spoonful to i 
pint of sauce, and boiling about 3 minutes or longer until 
thick enough. Note. — All the sauces containing milk' or 
cream should be mixed in a saucepan which is set over 
another in which is boiling water {bain-marie). Whenever a 
sauce of whatsoever kind it may be, is to be kept hot, set it 
also au bain-marie. 

COLORING FOR SA UCES OR SOUPS. 

If your soup or sauce is not of a satisfactory color, or if 
the flavor is harsh or unpleasing, chop up one onion, put 
it into a frying-pan with i tablespoonful of butter, and 
sprinkle over it about i saltspoonful of sugar. Stir together 
constantly, so that no one part may burn before all has 
attained a beautiful, clear, reddish brown. Add a few spoon- 
fuls of the sauce or soup you wish to improve ; stir well and 
pour into the body of the soup, which may continue to boil 
after this any time required. Strain before serving. 

BLENDING FOR SA UCES AND SOUPS. 
LIAISON. 
3 yolks of eggs, 8 tablespoons of cream. 

Beat the yolks of eggs in a bowl ; add the cream. Strain 
through a fine sieve. When the sauce or soup boils, put a few 
spoonfuls of it into the eggs and cream, stirring quickly ; iadd 
a little more by degrees ; when the liaison is quite smooth 
and warmed by the addition of the liquid, remove the sauce- 
pan from the fire and pour the eggs ana cream carefully into 
the soup or sauce. It may be heated again, but Oo not let it 



246 GOOD-LIVING. 

boil after the liaison ij added, or it will curdle. This is a 
great addition to all purees, whether soup or sauce. The 
above quantity will serve for 2 quarts of soup or i of sauce. 

BRO WN SA UCE. 

SAUCE ESPAGNOLE. 

2 slices of lean ham, i pound of lean veal, 

6 gills of stock, 3 sprigs of parsley, 

J^ bay-leaf, 3 sprigs of sweet herbs, thyme, etc., 

6 chives or i onion, chopped, , 3 shallots, 

2 virhole cloves, i blade of mace, 

2 gills of sherry. Flour and butter. 

Cut the ham and veal into small dice. Put them into a 
stewpan with 2 gills of the stock and simmer gently until the 
bottom of the saucepan is covered with a nice glaze ; then 
add about one gill more of the stock and stir it around to 
detach the glaze from the bottom of the pan. Add the herbs, 
seasonings, onions, etc., and the rest of the stock ; cover and 
simmer gently for two hours. Strain and skim off all fat. 
When ready to use, thicken it with a Brown Roux (see receipt), 
allowing about i tablespoonful of the roux to i pint of the 
gravy. Remove the roux from the fire. Add the gravy to 
it when the former is boiling; stir and blend perfectly 
smooth, boiling for about 2 minutes. Add lastly the wine, 
and a little cayenne if necessary. 

BROWN GRAVY. 

' JUS. 

2 pounds shin of beef, ^ pound of lean ham, 

I onion, 2 pints of water, 

Salt and black pepper-corns to taste, I blade of mace. 
Bunch of sweet herbs, ^ lai^ carrot. 

' y^ head of celery. 

Cut the beef and ham in small pieces. Slice the vegetables. 
Take a jar large enough to hold all the ingredients, including 
water. Arrange in layers the ham, beef, vegetables, and 



B&CHAMEL SAUCE. 247 

seasonings alternately ; pour the water over the whole. Set 
the cover on the jar and tie it so that the steam may not 
escape. Place it in a very moderate oven and let it bake 
from 6 to 8 hours. Should the oven be hot, less time will be 
required, say about 5 hours. Strain off the gravy, and when 
coldi skim off the grease. It may be flavored with wine, if 
necessary, but need not be thickened unless particularly 
desired ; in which case, use very little corn-starch blended 
with cold water, and boil 2 or 3 minutes. Recommended. 

CREAM SAUCE. 

SAUCE A LA CR£mE. 

I tablespoon of flour, 2 gills of new milk, 

I very large tablespoon of butter, ^ teaspoon of salt, 

Pepper to taste. 

Put \ of the butter in a saucepan over the fire. As soon as 
it melts, add the flour ; stir till blended. Be careful not to 
let it brown.. Add the boiling milk, by degrees, to the flour 
and butter, stirring without ceasing. Boil 3 minutes. 
Remove from the fire ; add salt, white pepper, and the rest 
of the butter ; stir until the butter melts, and serve imme- 
diately. If it has to be kept, set it over a kettle of boiling 
'^zX.tx {bain-marie) ; leave the spoon in it, and every now and 
again stir it down or the top will form a scum. Do not let it 
boil after the last butter is added. Cream may be used 
instead of new milk.

Stew the onion very gently in about i tablespoonful of 
butter, until very tender, but not at all brown ; add the ham. 



248 GOOD-LIVING. 

vegetables, herbs, and spices, and stew gently for 10 minutes, 
without browning. Then pour off any butter that may not 
have been absorbed. Add the Veloutd (see receipt) ; stir 
it in, and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 or 10 minutes, stirring 
constantly. Then add by degrees, a very little at a time, the 
cream, which should be rich, sweet, and not heated. When all 
the cream is well blended with the sauce, the latter should be 
velvet-smooth, rich, and delicious. Strain, and serve as soon 
as possible. Use for the preparation of this, and all kindred 
sauces, a saucepan, set over another of boiling water {bain- 
marie). Serve with fish, chicken, sweetbreads, etc. The 
above receipt is taken from a good French authority, that of 
Urbain-Dubois. A simpler adaptation of the above is to use 
a good, smooth Cream Sauce (see receipt) in place of the 
velout6, which may not always be attainable. 

SA UCE ALLEMANDE. 

Make exactly the same as Velout6 (see receipt),, boiling it 
down both before and after thickening until strong and well 
flavored. Beat the yolks of eggs in a bowl, allowing one 
more than for the velout6; mix them with a little grated 
nutmeg and a lump of butter the size of a hickory-nut. 
When the sauce is boiling, stir it very gradually into the eggs ; 
then replace it over boiling water on the fire, and stir it 
rapidly for a few minutes, biit do not let it boil. Be careful 
not to let it curdle. 

POULETTE SAUCE. 

SAUCE POULETTE. 

Cream Sauce, I teaspoon of chopped parsley, 

2 eggs, I " " " chives, 

White pepper. Salt. 

Make a Cream Sauce (see receipt). To this add the pars- 
ley and chives, or substitute for the latter \ an onion, grated. 
When it is boiling, stir it briskly into the eggs, which are 
ready, beaten, in a bowl. Return to the side of the fire, and 



PICKLE SAUCE. 249 

stir for i or 2 minutes, being very careful not to boil, or the 
eggs will curdle. Serve immediately. If this sauce has to 
be kept standing, do not add the eggs until the last moment 
before serving. 

CELERY SAUCE. 

SAUCE AU C^LERL 

Cut the celery in i-inch lengths ; put it in a saucepan ; 
cover with boiling water. Boil about 30 minutes, until ten- 
der. Make a White Roux (see receipt). Strain out the 
celery ; blend the water in which the celery was boiled with 
the roux. Set it over the fire and stir until perfectly smooth 
and thick ; add salt, pepper, and the celery ; set it over boil- 
ing water and let it stew gently until the celery begins to go 
to pieces. Or, make a Cream Sauce (see receipt), and when 
the celery is boiled tender, drain and stew it, as described, in 
th€ cream sauce. Serve with boiled turkey, chicken, etc. 

SA UCE VIABLE. 

White Sauce, Sherry, 

Celery-salt, Cayenne, 

Curry-powder. 

Blend about J teaspoonful of the curry with a little of the 
White Sauce (see receipt), then stir it into the rest. Add 
the other ingredients, about i gill of wine, and i saltspoon 
of celery-salt, and a pinch of cayenne ; taste, and be very 
careful not to allow any one flavor to predominate, except 
that the cayenne should be perceptible. This is a delicious 
sauce, but its success depends much upon the judicious ad- 
mixture of the various seasonings, as the strength of curry- 
powder and celery-salt vary too much to enable one to fix 
the exact quantities. Use for shell-fish, chicken, sweet- 
breads, etc. 

PICKLE SAUCE. 

SAUCE AUX CORNICHONS. 

To the receipt for White Sauce, add chopped gherkins or 
other vinegar (not mustard) pickles before serving. 



250 GOOD-LIVING. 

WHITE SA UCE. 

SAUCE BLANCHE. 

3 ounces of butter, i ounce of flour, 

2 gills of water. Pepper and salt. 

Put 2 ounces of the butter in a stewpan ; when it melts, 
add the flour. Stir for i minute or more, but do not brown. 
Then add by degrees the boiling water, stirring until smooth, 
and boiling about 2 minutes. If not perfectly smooth, pass 
it through a sieve ; then add the rest of the butter, cut in 
pieces. When the butter is melted, serve immediately. 
This makes about i pint of sauce. You may add as a great 
improvement a little lemon-juice or a few drops of vinegar. 
N. B. — If the sauce is to have other ingredients added, it is 
best to have it very thick to begin with. 

CAPER SAUCE.

rubbed smooth for coloring, salt, pepper, and cayenne. If 
possible, use i gill of cream and i gill of boiling water or 
stock in blending this sauce, as it will make it much richer 
and smoother. If you have no cream, rub up the coral with 
I tablespoonful of butter, adding it just before serving. 

PARSLEY CREAM SAUCE. 

To the receipt for White or for Cream Sauce add I heap* 
ing tablespoonful of finely-chopped parsley. 

CAULIFLOWER SAUCE. 

SAUCE AUX CHOUXFLEURS. 

Use either White or Cream Sauce (see receipts), adding to 
it the flowerets of cauliflower previously boiled tender. 
Serve with boiled fowl, veal saut6, etc., etc. 

OYSTER SAUCE. 

SAUCE AUX HUtTRES. 

To the receipt for Cream Sauce, add oysters. In this case 
wse the strained juice of the oysters to blend the flour and 
butter, adding cream or rich milk to make up the quantity 
required. It must be boiling when added to the butter 
and flour. The oysters must be scalded in their own juice 
until almost firm, then added to the sauce 5 minutes before 
it is to be served. Season with celery-salt, white pepper, 
Hnd cayenne. 

SAUCE VELOUT&. 

Proceed as for White Sauce (see receipt), using stock in- 
stead of water to blend the butter and flour, which last 
should be pale yellow. When it is cooked, remove it from 
the fire and stir it into the well-beaten yolks of 2 or 3 eggs. 
If you are by any misfortune obliged to keep it hot after 
the eggs are added, set it over hot water, and do not boil 



252 GOOD.LJVING. 

again, or it will curdle. Add salt, pepper, and a little 
lemon-juice and chopped parsley. A little grated onion 
may be added at the same time as the broth. In this case 
it is safer to strain the sauce before serving, to avoid the 
possibility of any onion remaining in it. N. B. — The best 
stock for this sauce is one made of chicken or veal and a 
little ham ; it should be highly flavored and not too dark- 
colored. The sauce, when ready to serve, should be light 
yellow. 

MAfTRE D'HdTEL BUTTER. 
BEURRE MaItRE D'h6tEL. 

Mix together, cold, i. tablespoonful each of butter and 
very finely-chopped parsley, and i teaspoonful of lemon-

fish, etc., spreading the top generously with it, setting in 
the mouth of the oven 2 or 3 minutes until melted.

saucepan which will stand in one of boiling water {bain- 
marie). Add the butter, pepper, and a pinch of grated nut- 
meg. Place the saucepan of eggs in the saucepan of boiling 
water, and stir without ceasing until the eggs begin to 
thicken. Do not allow the eggs to come to boiling point, 
or they will curdle. When beginning to thicken, add an 
equal bulk of the glaze described, a very little at a time, and 
stirring constantly. When as thick as very rich custard, add 
the vinegar as described above. If not acid enough, add a 
squeeze of lemon-juice and a pinch of salt, but very care- 
fully. If the sauce curdles, or is too thick, add a few drops 
af cold water and stir. Serve immediately with fish, lobster, 
diops, and grills of all sorts. Beefsteak broiled and served 
with this sauce is the famous dish at the historic Restaurant 
Henri IV. at St. Germain. 

TERRAPIN SA UCE. 

6 yolks of eggs, boiled very hard, i gill of cream,

boil. Remove from the fire and add the wine. Add what- 
ever meat or fish you wish to use with the sauce. Stand it ■ 
over boiling water {bain-marie) until heated through, and 
serve. This sauce is excellent with : 

Terrapin, Beefsteak,

hour before it is required, stand the dish over boiling water. 
Be sure the sauce and meat become thoroughly heated 
through. Serve in a casserole.

stalks ; chop all the best part as fine as powder. Put it in a 
bowl, and pour over it the boiling water, adding the sugar. 
Cover closely and set aside until cool, about 15 minutes. 
Then add the vinegar, pepper, and salt. Serve very cold 
with roast Iamb. The sauce should be thick with the 
chopped mint : it is usually the reverse, vinegar and water.

Rub together the flour and butter over the fire until pale 
yellow, but be careful not to brown it ; add the boiling stock 
by degrees, stirring constantly. Boil 3 minutes. Season 
with lemon-juice, salt, pepper, and serve. If for chicken 
fricassee, boiled mutton, boiled turkey, etc., use the liquor in 
which the meat or chicken has cooked, to blend the sauce. 



TARTARB: SAUCE, 26l 

MA YONNAISE SA UCE. 

SAUCE MAYONNAISE. 

Yolk of I egg (in summer 2 yolks), Pepper and salt, 

2 gills of olive oil (perhaps more). Vinegar. 

In the list of ingredients for the sauce should be included 
a large stock of patience, as, without it, there can be no May- 
onnaise ! It is one of the essentials, also, to the success of the 
same, to have both the egg and oil cold, therefore place them 
in the ice-box some time before they will be required. In 
summer, the soup-plate in which you make the dressing 
should be stood upon cracked ice in a pan. Having every- 
thing ready at hand, break the eggs, carefully separating 
whites and yolks. Put the yolks into a soup-plate ; pick out 
the germs, which you reject. Add a dash of white pepper 
and about ^ a saltspoon of salt to the egg, and work it around 
just enough to thoroughly mix; then begin with the oil, 
adding it, literally, drop by drop, stirring with a steady, not 
too rapid motion, and always in the same direction. Work 
in the oil in this way, until you have used about 2 gills. A 
practised hand will manage to make the egg hold more oil, 
by adding, whenever there is the slightest symptom of 
" cracking," a few drops of vinegar, mixing steadily for some 
time, and then beginning again with the oil. The juice of a 
lemon may be used for the necessary amount of acidity, after 
the dressing is made as above, but it whitens the sauce. 
Serve very cold with salads, etc.

6 large, tart apples, Soft sugar to taste, 

Butter, size of a walnut. Water. 

Pare, core, quarter the apples. Throw them into cold 
Water as you prepare them. Put them into a saucepan with 
just enough water to prevent scorching, not more than 2 gills. 
Boil very gently, uncovered, for about 40 minutes, or until 
the apples are perfectly soft. Press them through a coarse 
sieve ; add the butter and sugar to taste, and serve. 

N. B. — Be careful not to allow the sauce to scorch.

Slice and fry the onions brown, but do not burn. Put 
them in a saucepan with the Esp^piole (see receipt), catsup, 
wine, and i gill or 2 of the liquor in which the bones of the 
fish have boiled (or boiling water). Add seasonings, herbs, 



JELLY SAUCE FOR VENISON, ETC. 263 

Spices. Simmer 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Strain 
through a fine sieve ; add a squeeze of lemon-juice and an- 
chovy sauce to taste. Serve, pouring some of the sauce 
over the fish and the rest in a boat. This is an especially 
good sauce for baked fish ; may also be used with boiled 
fish, or may be prepared and the filets of fish stewed in it 
for about 5 minutes or more, according to their size. The 
Espagnole may be replaced by the same quantity of fish- 
broth thickened with roux (see Brown Roux). 

CRANBERRY SA UCE. 

Put the berries, well washed and picked over, in a sauce- 
pan with just enough water to prevent scorching, about i 
gill to a quart of fruit. Stew gently over a moderate fire. 
Stir frequently with a wooden spoon, mashing the fruit as 
much as possible. When the berries are all mashed and 
smooth (about 20 minutes), remove the saucepan from the 
fire, and stir in immediately enough sugar to sweeten to 
taste. Dissolve the sugar, but do not boil again. Rinse a 
mould with cold water ; pour in the fruit and set away to 
harden ; or if preferred, press the fruit through a coarse sieve, 
rejecting all the skins, and putting the smooth sauce into a 
mould as above. Serve with roast turkey. 

JELLY SAUCE FOR VENISON, ETC. 

Equal quantities of butter, currant-jelly, and port or ma- 
deira. Melt the butter first, then add the jelly, and when it 
is melted, the wine. Bring to boiling point and serve. 

Or, if you do not wish to use so much wine, put the jelly, 
a large piece of butter, and a little boiling water in a sauce- 
pan. When this comes to a boil, stir in a little corn-starch 
blended with a few drops of cold water. Add a little cayenne 
and some salt. Boil for 3 minutes ; add wine to taste ; 
bring to boiling point and serve. The proportions for this 
last : I teaspoon of butter, \ tumbler of jelly, i gill of water, 
I small teaspoonful of corn-starch, i gill of wine.

VEGETABLES. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

As we are particularly favored in this country by the 
bountiful supply and variety of our vegetables, we should 
take very great care in their preparation in order to do them 
justice. Always procure the freshest that you can. If by 
any chance you are obliged to use those which have been in 
the house 24 hours, lay them in cold water to freshen and 
revive them before cooking. The time-table for vegetables 
has been most carefully prepared, and will answer most 
questions that are asked of it. There is to be added, how- 
ever, one thing upon which too great stress cannot be laid. 
When the vegetable is cooked perfectly tender and ready to 
be removed from the fire, drain it thoroughly. Not only 
allow the water to run off, but, wherever it is possible, press 
the water out in the colander ; or, when this is not possible, 
stand the colander on something over the fire, that the water 
may be driven off by the heat. Resort to any device that 
may suggest itself to you rather than allow your vegetables 
to remain wet and soggy. Any amount of seasoning that 
you may add will not give them the proper taste if the water 
from the boiling is allowed to remain in them. 

Certain vegetables, notably string-beans, green peas, 
spinach, sorrel, and Brussels sprouts, should always be 
boiled uncovered, to preserve the freshness of their color. It 
will be found less necessary, in this case, to use soda for the 
same purpose, unless the water is very hard. Another 
important rule is to remove the vegetable from the fire and 
drain it the moment it is sufficiently cooked. Do not draw 
it aside and let it stand in the water, or it will be quite 
spoiled.

266 GOOD.LIVING. 

TO BOIL POTA TOES (WINTER). 

POMMES DE TERRE AU NATUREL. 

Select potatoes of uniform size. It is best not to pare 
them beforehand, unless it to be to remove a narrow belt of 
skin all around the potato. However, toward the end of the 
winter, they require to be peeled and the blemishes removed. 
When this time comes, it is best to serve them prepared ac- 
cording to some of the various receipts for dressing potatoes. 

Put the potatoes into an iron pot, with just enough well- 
salted cold water to cover them. Do not put the lid on the 
pot. Let them boil until nearly done, 25 to 30 minutes. 
Try them with a fork, and if almost tender all through, pour 
off all but about i gill of the water in the bottom of the pot. 
Return it to the fire, and put on a close cover ; steam until 
quite done; then remove the lid, sprinkle with salt, and 
allow them to stand a few minutes on the fire to evaporate 
the water. They should be dry and flaky. If not, cover 
with a towel or flannel folded in 4, and let stand a few 
minutes longer. Dish carefully, previously peeling if neces- 
sary. It will require about 35 minutes for the entire process 
for potatoes of medium size. 

The water in which unpeeled potatoes are boiled is said to 
be poisonous, and an excellent means of destroying green-fly 
on rose-bushes. 

POTATOES TO SERVE WITH BOILED FISH. 

POMMES DE TERRE AU COURT BOUILLON. 

Cut the potatoes in the sh^pe of large olives. Throw them 
into cold water as you trim them. If you boil the fish in 
Fish Stock or Court Bouillon, take some of the same and 
boil the potatoes in it 15 or 20 minutes, until tender. When 
the fish is dished, drain, salt, and dry the potatoes, and 
arrange them tastefully around the fish, with plenty of 
parsley as a garnish. Serve with Hollandaise Sauce. 



BAKED POTATOMS. 26? 

TO BOIL NEW POTATOES. 

These should never be peeled with a knife. Scrub and 
rub the skin until clean. Cover with boiling water, and boil 
rapidly from 1 5 to 20 minutes with the cover on. Drain the 
potatoes ; sprinkle with salt, and put back on the fire, un- 
covered, for a few minutes to dry. Dish in a folded napkin, 
and serve very hot. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

POMMES DE TERRE EN PURINE. 

6 or seven potatoes, [ gill of cream, 

I tablespoon of butter, Salt and pepper. 

Peel and boil as directed for Winter Potatoes. Slightly 
heat the cream, butter, salt, and pepper. When the potatoes 
are cooked, and all are hot, add the cream to the potatoes 
and m£ish until perfectly smooth. Be generous with good 
butter. Make the pur^e very soft, and if you want it par- 
ticularly perfect, beat it hard with a fork or egg-beater a few 
minutes before serving. Serve very hot. 

POTATO SNOW. 

POMMES DE TERRE EN NEIGE. 

Boil as directed with the skins on. Then peel the potatoes 
and set for a few minutes over the fire to dry out, having 
sprinkled them with salt. When quite dry, rub them 
through a colander. Do not disturb the snow as it drops, or 
it will flatten. This same preparation may be put into a 
bake-dish and set in the oven until slightly browned. 

BAKED POTATOES. 

Select for this purpose the largest and smoothest. Put 
them in the oven, opening the door every little while, taking 
each one in a coarse cloth and pressing it all over. They 
will require about 1 hour. 



2d8 GOOD-LlVtNG. 

TO ROAST POTATOES WITH BEEF. 

Select potatoes of uniform size. Peel ; wash clean, and 
lay in the pan with the beef (mutton or veal) about i hour 
before the meat is to be done. Baste frequently ; ^erve 
around the meat. 

COLD BOILED POT A TOES. 

Note. — All potatoes, which are to be boiled first and then 
dressed, must be boiled in their skins and set away to get 
cold with their skins on. This applies especially to potatoes 
to be used in hashes. It makes a wonderful difference, and 
should be observed ; the potato is much easier to cut neatly, 
and does not crumble to pieces in the cooking. For potato 
salad, the potatoes should never be cooked in any other way. 

POTATOES SAUTi.. 

POMMES DE TERRE SAUTifiES. 

Having boiled the potatoes and set them away with their 
skins on, peel them, cutting across in slices about \ of an 
inch thick. The potatoes used should be rather small. 
Heat a large lump of butter in a saucepan. Lay the pota- 
toes in, cover, and stew, not fry, them in the butter. There 
must be enough butter for every slice to get its coating and 
absorb as much as it will. Chop a tablespoonful of chervil 
and one of parsley as fine as powder. Stir it carefully into 
the potatoes ; add salt and pepper, and when they have 
cooked about 1 5 minutes, serve. They should not be allowed 
to crisp or brown. Shake the pan from time to time to 
prevent sticking or browning. 

New potatoes may be saut6d as above, but whole. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES. 

POMMES DE TERRE X LA LYONNAISE. 

Having boiled the potatoes with their skins on and left 
them to cool in the same way, peel, and slice about ^ of an 



POTATO PUFF. 269 

inch thick. Put a large tablespoonful of butter in a sauce- 
psin. When the butter melts, throw in \ of an onion, chopped 
fine. Fry it light golden-brown ; then lay in the potatoes ; 
draw the pan to a cooler part of the range, and let the pota- 
toes cook in the butter until it is nearly absorbed. Then let 
it stand on the hotter part of the fire for 2 or 3 minutes until 
the edges of the potatoes are very slightly browned. Add 
pepper, salt, and i tablespoonful each of parsley and chervil, 
chopped as fine as powder. Mix very carefully with the 
potatoes and serve on a hot dish. On no account allow the 
potatoes to fry brown or crisp. They must be sauted, not 
fried. Or, another way is to fry half an onion in the butter ; 
remove it ; then put in the potatoes and finish as above 
directed. This is even more delicate. Serve with beefsteak, 
etc. 

FRIED POTATO HASH. 

Having boiled and cooled the potatoes with their skins 
on, peel and chop, not too fine. Melt in a frying-pan a large 
lump of sweet drippings or butter, or both mixed. Quite a 
large tablespoonful of each will be required for an ordinary 
dish of potatoes. When the butter is hot, lay -in the pota- 
toes. Sprinkle generously with pepper and salt. Take a 
long knife, and every minute or two run it under the pota' 
toes, turning them up from the bottom. Be careful not to 
mash them. Fry until the edges are well browned, and 
serve. 

POTATO PUFF. 

2 caps of hot or cold mashed potatoes, i tablespoon of bntter, 

3 tablespoons of cream, 1 2 'gg^t 

Salt and pepper. 

Put the potatoes into a frying-pan, adding the yolks of 
eggs, cream, and seasonings. Stir over the fire until well 
mixed and hot. Remove from the fire. Stir in carefully 
the whites, beaten to a stiff froth. Heap on a greased sheet 
of tin, or in gem-pans, and bake in a quick oven until well 
browned.

POTATO CROQUETTES. 

CROQUETTES DE POMMES DE TERRE. 

9 cups of mashed potatoes. Yolks of 2 eggs, 

I teaspoon of grated onion or juice, i teaspoon of salt, 

I " " powdered sweet-marjoram, 2 tablespoons of cream, 

I tablespoon of cliopped paisley. Butter, size of a walnut, 
Cayenne. 

Beat the yolks to a cream ; add them and all the other 
ingredients to the potatoes ; mix. Put into a saucepan and 
stir over the fire until the mixture leaves the sides of the 
pan. When cold, form into balls or long croquettes i x 2^ 
inches. Dip first in egg, then in bread-crumbs, making them 
very smooth and even. Set away in the ice-box for i hour 
or more. Then fry golden-brown. The lard should be deep 
enough to cover them. Use a frying-basket (see General 
Directions for iFrying). When fried light golden-brown, drain 
on brown paper and set in the mouth of the oven. When 
dry, serve as a garnish for braised meat of any kind, or as a 
vegetable. 

NEW ORLEANS POTATOES. 

POMMES DE TERRE A LA CREOLE. 

Pare and cut raw potatoes into }-inch dice. Throw them 
into ice-water for 30 minutes to i hour. Drain very dry. 
Have ready a kettle of deep lard. When you are sure it is 
really boiling, drop in the potatoes and fry golden brown 4 
to S minutes (see General Directions for Frying). Lift them 
out; drain; dry on brown paper in the mouth of the oven. 
Sprinkle with salt, and serve. A \ onion fried first in the 
lard gives a very pleasant flavor. 

POTATO BALLS. 

POMMES DE TERRE EN BOULETTES. 

5 medium-sized potatoes, Nutmeg, cayenne, salt, 

I tablespoon of chopped paisley. Yolk of i egg. 

Prepare the potatoes as directed for Mashed Potatoes.

egg, then in fine bread-crumbs, and fry in deep boiling lard. 
Use a frying-basket (see General Directions for Frying). 
When fried gold-color, drain; dry on brown paper in the 
mouth of the oven. Dish in a pyramid on a folded napkin 
or cut paper, or use as a garnish for roasted or braised filet, 
veal, etc., etc. , 

POTATO SOUFFLi. 

POMMES DE TERRE EN S0UPFL£. 

2 cups of potatoes, mashed 2 eggs, 

2 tablespoons of melted butter, ' Salt, 

5 " " cream. Pepper. 

Beat the the potatoes and butter until smooth and light ; 
add the cream, yolks of eggs, and salt. Beat the whites to a 
stiff froth and stir them in. Heap upon a tin in a rough, 
uneven mound (neat, but jagged, so that the tips and 
edges, when browned, will look nicely), and set in the oven 
until well browned ; or bake in a dish that can be sent 
to table. Or, use this same mixture to make an edge for 
fricass6e or curry, using a dish which can go both in the 
oven and to the table. NOTE. — 2 tablespoonfuls of grated 
cheese added to the cream is a great improvement. 

POTATOES A LA BRABANQONNE. 

POMMES DE TERRE A LA BRABANfONNE. 

6 potatoes, mashed, Pepper and salt, 

2 tablespoons of chopped ham. Bread-crumbs, 

I tablespoon of chopped parsley, Butter,

Prepare the Mashed Potatoes as directed (see receipt), add- 
ing cream, butter, etc. To this add the ham, parsley, onion, 
pepper, and salt. Put the mixture into a fire-proof dish that 
can be sent to table. Cover the potatoes with fine bread- 
crumbs and dots of butter, and bake 20 minutes, until the 
top is nicely browned.

6 smooth, medium-sized potatoes, 3 teaspoons of butter, 

Salt, pepper, cayenne, 3 " " grated cheese, 

I tablespoon of chopped parsley, 3 " "cream. 

Milk or cream, i egg. 

Wash and bake the potatoes, squeezing often during the 
cooking. Cut an end off of each one ; scoop out the soft 
inside with a teaspoon. Do not break the skins. Set aside 
the empty shells. Mash the soft potato very smooth ; add 
the butter, cream, parsley, chopped as fine as powder ; the 
salt, pepper, cheese, and a good dash of cayenne. The best 
cheese for this purpose is a mixture of equal parts of grated 
Parmesan and Gruyfere. Put the mixture into a saucepan 
with enough good milk or cream to make it quite soft. Stir 
over the fire until scalding hot. Remove and stir in the egg, 
which has been slightly beaten. Fill the empty potato-shells 
with this. Round out the ends ; cover the ends with bread- 
crumbs, and set in the oven until nicely browned, about 1 5 
minutes.

boil, then stir in the flour blended with a little cold milk. 
Stir carefully, and put on one side where the potatoes can 
stew very gently for 15 or 20 minutes, stirring to prevent 
scorching. It is safest to cook these over boiling water 
{bain-marie). Then add the butter and finely-chopped

cloth ; cover and pat them dry, dropping them quickly int6 
the lard, as they must not lose their coldness in handling. 
Have at hand a skimmer and keep the slices apart in the lard 
while they are cooking. The instant they are light yellow, 
skim them out upon a colander set in the mouth of the oven, 
putting a plate under to catch any lard that may drip. 
Sprinkle evenly with salt. Or the potatoes, when drained, 
may be laid upon brown paper in the mouth of the oven. 
They will keep for some time in a dry place, but must 
always be heated in the mouth of the oven before serving. 
Never let them brown. If properly fried, there should not 
be an atom of grease upon them. This is the Saratoga way 
of cooking potato chips. Serve with beefsteak, etc. 

JULIENNE POTATOES. 

POMMES DE TERRE A LA JULIENNE. 

Peel and cut raw potatoes in long, thin strips. Fry in 
boiling lard as directed for Potato Chips. Serve with 
beefsteak, etc. 

POTA TOES A LA PARISIENNE. 

POMMES DE TERRE A LA PARISIENNE. 

10 potatoes, 4 ounces of butter, 

Salt and pepper. Chopped parsley. 

Peel the raw potatoes and cut them in balls with a scoop 
made for the purpose. Throw them into a bowl of cold 
water as you cut them. Then drain them and put into 
salted boiling water for 5 minutes. Drain them dry and put 
into a frying-pan with the hot butter. Toss them until each 
h£is its share of butter. Set the pan in the oven for a few 
minutes until the potatoes are brown ; then sprinkle them 
with salt and chopped parsley and serve. 

Or, having cut them in balls, scalded and well dried as 
above, throw them into boiling lard 2 inches deep, and cook 
until of an even golden brown; drain on brown paper; 
sprinkle with salt and serve. 



SIVEET POTATO PUREE WITH TOMATO SAUCE. 2/7 
POTA TOES A LA FRANQAISE. 

POMMES DE TERRE X LA FRANgAISE. 

Peel ; cut raw in length, in sections like an orange and throw 
in very cold water ; dry in a towel and fry in boiling lard until 
gold color. Drain on brown paper ; sprinkle with salt, and 
serve with beefsteak, etc. 

BAKED SWEET POTATOES. 

PATATES DOUCES. 

Wash the potatoes, and put them in the oven. From time 
to time open the door, and with a cloth, squeeze them until 
tender. The time varies with the size, but is about I hour. 

FRIED SWEET POTA TOES. 

PATATES DOUCES SAUT^ES AU BEURRE. 

Cut cold boiled potatoes lengthwise in slices. Fry in very 
hot butter till brown. Be carpful not to bum. Or, sxaXk 
them, as directed for white potatoes. 

CARAMEL SWEET POTATOES. 

PATATES DOUCES AU CARAMEL. 

Fry as above directed ; while frying, sprinkle with sugar. 
This serves for a simple dessert. 

SWEET POTATO PURME WITH TOMATO SAUCE. 

PUR]£e DE PATATES DOUCES, SAUCE TOMATE. 

Boil the potatoes, peeled, until tender, about i hour ; or, 
still better, bake them. Either way will do, but baking in- 
creases their sweetness. When soft, remove the skin and 
mash them as directed for Sweet Potato Pur^e. Add a large 



278 GOOD-LIVING. 

lump of butter, and enough milk to make the pur6e just soft 
enough to hold in shape when heaped in a mound. Season 
with pepper and salt. Use this to fill the centre of a dish oi 
veal cutlets, sautd or fried, small filets, chops, etc., etc. Serve 
in a sauce-boat, at the same time, a rich Tomato Sauce (see 
receipt). This is an excellent combination. Sweet potatoes 
prepared in this way make a very good substitute for Pur6e 
of Chestnuts. 

SWEET POTATOES ROASTED WITH MEAT. 

Peel and wash the potatoes. One hour before the joint is 
to be served, lay the potatoes in the pan, and baste from 
time to time with the gravy. Dish around the meat, and 
serve. 

SWEET POTATO PURME BAKED. 

Sweet potatoes, i egg, 

Milk, Butter, 

Salt. 

Put 4 to 8 sweet potatoes, according to size, into the oven 
to bake, squeezing them with a cloth from time to time until' 
perfectly soft, about i hour. When done, peel ; mash through 
a colander. Add a large tablespoonful of butter, the larger 
the better ; milk enough to make the pur^e of the consist- 
ency of soft dough. Add a pinch of salt. Butter a tin pie- 
plate, or sheet of tin. Arrange the purde in a neat mound. 
Beat an egg slightly, and with it brush over the pur6e. Set 
in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until a good brown crust 
is formed over the top. The above may also be made with 
boiled sweet potatoes, but baking makes them sweeter. Do 
not spare the butter. 

BOILED SWEET POTATOES. 

Wash and put them down in boiling water, boiling about 
I hour or more, according to size. This vegetable varies so 
in size as to make it imoossible to fix the time exactly. 



BAKED TOMATOES. 279 

FRIED TOM A TOES WITH CREAM. 

TOMATES FRITES A LA CRfeME. 

Cut 6 large tomatoes in half, without peeling. Lay them, 
skin-side downward, in a pan, in which you have melted a 
large tablespoonful of butter and sweet drippings mixed. 
Fry slowly uiitil tender. Three tablespoonfuls of boiling 
water may be added to the pan at first, as it will steam off 
and make the tomatoes more tender, without blackening 
them, as if cooked with butter alone. When tender, remove 
the tomatoes to a hot dish ; let the butter brown a little, with 
a tablespoonful of flour stirred into it. When brown, draw 
aside and stir into it J pint of boiling milk, stirring and 
blending until smooth. Stir and boil 3 minutes, then pour 
this over the tomatoes, adding salt and cayenne to taste. 
This is not a pretty dish, but is excellent. If the top of the 
range is occupied, the pan of tomatoes may be set in the 
oven, with equally good results.' 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

TOMATES FARCIES. 

Select medium-sized smooth tomatoes for this purpose. 
Cut a slice from the stem end. With a spopn scoop out all 
the seeds and centre, taking care not to break the outer 
walls. Drain off the water from the inside that has been 
removed. Take sufficient bread-crumbs to fill the cavities 
thus made. Chop about i tablespoonful of parsley very 
fine ; mix it with the crumbs, adding plenty of salt and pep- 
per. Melt a large tablespoonful of butter in the frying-pan ; 
stir in the bread-crumbs and the solid part of the tomato 
centres. Stir them until well mixed, 5 minutes ; then fill 
the tomatoes, heaping a little above the edge ; sprinkle with 
bread-crumbs ; put a small lump of butter on each ; set in a 
baking-pan, with a small lump of butter, and bake in a 
moderate oven i hour to i hour and 1 5 minutes. 



28o GOOD-UVING. 

STUFFED TOMA TOES A LA REINE. 

TOMATES FARCIES A LA REINE. 

^ pound of white meat, chicken, veal, i tablespoon of vinegar,

I heaping tablespoon of chopped pars- Pinch of sugar, 

ley, Cayenne to taste, 

I heaping tablespoon of chopped ham, i onion, grated, 
. 12 medium-sized tomatoes. 

Chop the meat very fine ; add stale bread-crumbs ; then 
all the other seasonings, reserving the egg. Cut the stem 
end from the tomatoes ; scoop out all the soft part with a 
small spoon, being careful not to break the outer walls. 
Drain the fruity part of the tomato and mix it with the 
stuffing. Chop all together very fine. Have the empty 
tomatoes in a tin pan with a small lump of butter. Put a 
lump of butter into the frying-pan, and, when hot, put in the 
dressing and stir it over a sharp fire, taking care not to burn. 
Remove from the fire. If not as soft as a very thick custard, 
add a little broth. When slightly cool, beat in the egg and 
fill the tomatoes with the mixture. Cover the tops with 
bread-crumbs and dots of butter ; bake about 30 minutes. 
Serve as a separate entrde, or with chicken or veal. 

STUFFED TOMA TOES WITH TOMA TO SA UCE. 

TOMATES FARCIES k L'^CARLATE. 

Having prepared the tomatoes as directed for Stuffed 
Tomatoes k la Reine, make a rich Tomato Sauce (see 
receipt), to which add about i gill of sherry. Serve the 
tomatoes neai.!y dished and garnished, with the sauce in a 
sauce-boat, as an entree. 

TOMATOES ROASTED WITH BEEF OR VEAL. 

Select tomatoes of uniform size. Wash ; cut out the stem 
end ; sprinkle with pepper and salt and place in the pan with 



TOMATOES SCALLOPED. 28 1 

roasting beef or veal i hour before the meat is to be done. 
If very small, allow a little less time. Baste frequently, and 
dish around the meat. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 

Wash the tomatoes, then throw boiling water over them ; 
let stand for 5 minutes, and the skins will slip off easily. Cut 
off the stem end ; divide in 2 or 4, and throw into a china- 
lined kettle. Set on the fire uncovered. In about an hour, 
ladle out all the juice and set it aside to serve for soup (see 
Tomato Soup or Okra Gumbo). Add to this i onion cut in 
4. Simmer for about i or 2 hours longer. They must cook 
very slowly. Now drain off all superfluous juice ; add a 
lump of butter, pepper, salt, and, if the tomatoes are very 
acid, a pinch of sugar ; serve. This is certainly the best way 
to stew tomatoes, but is rather extravagant, unless at the 
height of the season, as it takes about a peck of tomatoes to 
make a good dishful stewed. After cooking 2 hours, be 
careful not to let them cook rapidly or scorch, or they will 
acquire a bitterish taste from the seeds. A good way also 
is, after scalding and peeling as above, to put them in a 
china-lined kettle, uncovered, draining off after the first 
hour ; add a good handful of stale bread-crumbs, {■ of a 
chopped onion, pepper and salt. The bread-crumbs being 
cooked for quite an hour longer with the tomatoes absorb a 
great deal of the superfluous juice, and become more like the 
fruit itself than any other thickening. The bread-crumbs 
must be very stale and dry. The usual system of using 
flour or corn-starch is not recommended. When ready to 
serve, add a lump of butter, pepper, and salt. 

TOMATOES SCALLOPED. 

Scald and skin enough tomatoes to fill a qu£ut baking-dish. 
Lay a layer of these tomatoes in the bottom of the dish. 
Cover with a thick layer of bread-crumbs, dots of butter, 
pepper, and salt. Another layer of tomatoes; .then, finish 



282 GOOD.LIVING. 

the top with a second layer of bread-crumbs closely packed, 
dotted over with butter, sprinkled with pepper and salt. 
Set in a slow oven for i hour to i hour and 1 5 minutes, 
until browned and baked down. As tomatoes are about 90 
per cent, water, they must always be steamed off in cooking 
or have the liquid absorbed in some way. Canned tomatoes 
may be cooked according to the above receipt, using only 
the solid fruit, and cooking about 45 minutes, perhaps less, 
in a quicker oven than the above. 

TOMA TOES STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS. 

TOMATES FARCIES AUX CHAMPIGNONS.

toes. 

TOMATO SOUFFLE. 

TOMATES EN SOUFFL^. 

Stew down the tomatoes as directed, draining off the 
liquid ; press the fruit through a coarse sieve. To about 2 
gills of this pulp allow 3 eggs. Beat the yolks and whites 
apart ; mix the yolks with the pulp ; season with pepper and 
salt ; then, at the last moment, add the whites beaten to a 
sti£f froth. Fill buttered china souffl6-cases with the mixture 
not more than f full, and bake in a quick oven for 6 to 10 
minutes. Or heat a bake-dish large enough to hold all the 
souffle, and bake it in a very quick oven for about 10 to 1$ 
minutes. Watch carefully and serve immediately. For 
detailed directions for baking, see Omelette SoufH^. 

TOMA TO-RICE. 

RIZ AUX TOMATES. 

Stew the tomatoes as directed ; press through a coarse 
sieve. To about 2 gills of this sauce allow l gill of rice ; 
wash and hgil 20 minutes. Drain the rice thoroughly and 



MUSHROOMS. 283 

mix with the sauce, adding salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar, 
if the tomatoes are acid. Set the saucepan on one side 
where it can stew gently, uncovered, for 15 or 20 minutes. 
Take care that it does not scorch. Add a small lump of 
butter, and when it is melted, serve. Do not stir the rice 
around ; lift it from the bottom with a fork to mix it. If the 
pulp of the fruit is used in the preparation of this dish, it 
will be found to be much richer than the common fashion 
of using the juice of the tomato alone for the purpose. 

TOMATOES WITH MACARONI. 

MACARONI AUX TOMATES.

naise, omitting the ham and cheese. 

MUSHROOMS. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

It is of primary importance in the choice of mushrooms to 
beware of the false ones, as they very closely resemble the 
edible ones. Never eat those that grow in shady, woody 
spots ; but give preference, on the contrary, to those that 
grow in the broad field and open sunshine. Gather them as 
soon after sunrise as possible. They should be snowy-white 
on top, and pale^pink in the gills underneath, if very young, 
but becoming from brown to black in the gills as the day 
advances and they grow older. It is no detriment to them 
to have spread open ; these are best for broiling, while the 
" button mushrooms " serve for other ways of cooking. The 
safest mushrooms are those that are raised in mushroom- 
houses. Those in the field should only be culled by persons 
who know and understand them. The skin of a good mush- 
room should peel off easily ; yet all mushrooms that do peel 
easily are not necessarily good ; on the other hand, there are 
some very terrible-looking ones, which are in reality perfectly 



284 GOOD-LIVING. 

innocuous, such as the morille, which is much used in France, 
and often dried. There are also " puff balls," which, though 
very alarming in appearance, make perfectly good and safe 
eating. But the point of the .whole thing is this : do not 
trust your own judgment about them unless you have had 
experience. The only test that appears to exist is the old- 
fashioned one of the silver spoon, which, it is said, will dis- 
color in cooking if the mushrooms are poisonous. 

BROILED MUSHROOMS. 

CHAMPIGNONS GRILLES. 

Select the largest mushrooms that are to be had. Peel. 
Cut the stalks J an inch from the tops. Baste well with 
melted butter, sprinkle lightly with pepper and salt. Heat 
the broiler very hot ; lay the mushrooms upon it with the 
upper side down ; close it carefully, that the mushrooms may 
not be broken, and broil thfem over a clear fire, turning the 
broiler first on one side, then on the other. As soon as ten- 
der, which will be ' in about 5 minutes, open the broiler, 
remove the mushrooms carefully to trimmed and well-but- 
tered slices of toast, or thin bread fried in butter. Moisten 
with melted butter, and serve. 

FRIED MUSHROOMS. 

CHAMPIGNONS SAUTES X l'hUILE. 

Peel large, hot-house mushrooms, measuring 4 to 6 inches 
across, and cut the stalks close. Have ready in a frying-pan 
some sweet oil, pepper, and salt. When hot, put in the 
mushrooms and fry until thoroughly heated, about 5 min- 
utes, perhaps less. Too much cooking will toughen them. 
Serve on neatly-trimmed and buttered slices of thin toast, 
putting I teaspoonful of wine, white or sherry, on each 
mushroom. 



PLAIN STEWED MUSHROOMS. 285 

MUSHROOMS STEWED WITH CREAM. 

CHAMPIGNONS SAUTES A LA CR^ME. 

I pint of fresh mushrooms, i tablespoon of butter, 

Flour, 2 tablespoons of thick cream, 

I egg-yolk, • 1 tablespoon of sherry, 

Salt, Pepper. 

Peel the mushrooms and scrape the stems. Cut off the 
earthy ends of the stalks. Wash in cold water. Put into a 
china-lined saucepan. Cut the butter into 4 parts ; roll each 
in flour, and put into the saucepan. Simmer for 1 5 minutes, 
stirring occasionally ; then add the cream, salt, and pepper. 
Bring to a boil. Remove from the fire and stir in the yolk 
of egg beaten with the sherry. Serve immediately in a deep, 
hot dish. 

TO STEW CANNED MUSHROOMS. 

1 can of mushrooms, I tablespoon of butter, 
Yolk of I eggi I " " sherry, 

2 gills of milk, or cream, i " " flour, 
Salt, Pepper. 

Drain the mushrooms. Put the butter into a china-lined 
saucepan ; when melted, stir in the flour ; rub smooth ; add 
the boiling milk and stir until it boils 2 minutes. Add the 
mushrooms, salt, and pepper, and stir only until thoroughly 
heated. Remove from the fire ; stir in the egg beaten with 
the wine ; then serve on neatly trimmed and buttered slices 
of toast, or on thin slices of bread fried in butter. Irt cook- 
ing canned mushrooms, do not boil them, as they are already 
cooked, and only require to be heated.

them. Take them out of the water with your hands, letting 
all the water drip from them, but do not dry them. Put 
them in a china-lined saucepan on the fire. Rub the butter 
up with about a teaspoonful of flour, or a little less corn- 
starch ; when the mushrooms begin to stew, stir in the 
butter ; stew gently for about 1 5 minutes, if you have used 
flour ; if you use corn-starch, add it 3 minutes before the 
mushrooms are to be served. Add salt and pepper, and 
serve. 

BAKED MUSHROOMS. 

Select large mushrooms. Peel. Cut off the stalks half an 
inch from the top. Place them with the upper side down in 
a pie-dish ; sprinkle with salt and pepper ; put a small piece 
of butter on each. Bake in a quick oven 10 to 15 minutes, 
until tender, basting frequently with melted butter. Add a 
few drops of lemon-juice. Serve hot on the same dish. 

MUSHROOMS A LA BORDELAISE. 

CHAMPIGNONS X LA BORDELAISE. 

I pound of best mushrooms, I tablespoon o£ oil, • 

12 whole pepper-corns, Pinch of salt. 

Peel the mushrooms ; scrape the stalks ; wash ; remove 
the earthy ends ; drain and cut in even pieces. Put thdm 
into a bowl with the oil, salt, and black pepper-corns. Let 
them stand 2 hours. Melt a piece of butter the size of a 
hickory-nut in a saucepan. Now drain out the mushrooms ; 
put them into the saucepan with the butter and stew for 6 
minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce as follows : 

3 tablespoons of oil, I teaspoon of chopped parsley, 

I clove of garlic, crushed and chopped, i " chopped chives. 

Put these ingredients into a saucepan ; stir over the fire 
for fiv^ minutes ; then pour the sauce over the mushrooms, 
and serve on large Croutons fried in butter (see receipt). 



TO BOIL ASPARAGUS. 28/ 

SCALLOPED MUSHROOMS. 

COQUILLES DE CHAMPIGNONS. 

Cut the mushrooms if too large, after peeling them and 
trimming the stalks. Throw them for a few minutes into 
boiling water, then drain and throw into cold water to whiten 
them. Dry well and saut6 in hot butter for 3 minutes. 
Then add, when almost done, a teaspoon of flour and some 
chopped parsley. Stir, and in 3 minutes add a cupful of 
boiling broth. Let it simmer very gently for about 10 min- 
utes. Add lemon-juice, salt, and pepper. Remove from 
the fire and stir in the yolk of an egg beaten up with a few 
drops of cold water or 2 teaspoonfuls of sherry. Fill shells 
with this mixture ; cover the top with bread-crumbs ; dot- 
with butter ; set in the oven until thoroughly hot, and serve. 

TO BOIL ASPARAGUS. 

ASPERGES EN BRANCHES. 

Scrape the coarse skin from each blade, throwing it into 
cold water as it is done. Then tie securely in a bunch with 
tapes or strips of muslin. Make the tips even, and cut the 
lower ends all of one length. Have ready an asparagus- 
boiler with boiling water and about \ a teaspoonful of 
salt. Lay the asparagus on the drainer, and set it in the 
boiler. In 18 or 20 minutes after it comes again to a boil, 
the asparagus should be tender. Be careful that it does not 
boil too soft. Remove the drainer, and not only drain the 
asparagus very thoroughly, but steam off all the moisture cis 
well as you can. Have ready some thin slices of toast, but' 
tered and trimmed. Lay the bunch of asparagus on these ; 
then remove the strings. Serve in a sauce-boat apart, a 
Cream Sauce, or a White Sauce (see receipts), adding a few 
drops of lemon-juice or vinegar to the latter. A delicious 
sauce for asparagus is made thus: Take i yolk of hard- 
boiled egg for each person. Mash it to a powder; add a 
little salt and pepper, and rub into it enough melted butter 



288 GOOD-LIVING. 

to make it as thick as mayonnaise. Or, again, you may 
serve plain melted butter in a sauce-boat ; but avoid if pos- 
sible the prevailing fashion of serving asparagus looking 
like modified milk-toast, with drawn butter poured over it. 

N. B. — Take note that the asparagus (as indeed all boiled 
vegetables) should be drained dry. 

SPRUE AND EGGS (ENGLISH RECEIPT). 

Having cut 2 bunches of asparagus in i-inch pieces, 
using the tender parts only, boil it in 2 quarts of boiling 
water with ^ an ounce of salt for about lo minutes, until 
tender. Drain thoroughly. Take 3 eggs ; beat yolks and 
whites apart ; add to the yolks i tablespoonful of milk 
or cream, i teaspoonful of butter, salt, and pepper ; mix 
these with the asparagus. Stir in the whites ; put into a 
saucepan, and cook just long enough to heat them through ; 
then serve in a deep dish with a border of large Crofltons 
(see receipt). 

STEWED ASPARAGUS TIPS. 

ASPERGES EN PETITS-POIS. 

4 bunches of green asparagus, 2 quarts of boiling water, 

}i ounce of salt, 2 ounces of butter, 

6 tablespoons of Cream Sauce, Pinch of grated nutmeg, 

I level saltspoon of sugar, Salt and pepper. 

Cut the tender parts of the asparagus into pieces about 
I inch long, and throw them into cold water. Have ready 
a saucepan with 2 quarts of boiling water and ^ an ounce 
of salt. Drain the asparagus and throw it into the boiling 
water. Boil rapidly until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain 
very thoroughly, and return to the fire with the butter, salt, 
pepper, nutmeg, sugar, and Cream Sauce (see receipt). Stir 
carefully, that you may not break the asparagus ; when 
scalding hot, serve on neatly trimmed rounds of thin, buttered 
toast. 

N. B. — Use the coarse ends of the asparagus for Asparagus 
Soup (see receipt). 



GREEN PEAS. 289 

TO BOIL GREEN PEAS. 

PETITS-POIS. 

Shell young peas into a bowl of cold water. When ready 
to cook them, have a large kettle of boiling water on the 
fire. Drain the peas and put them into the kettle. Do not 
put on the lid. Let them cook rapidly for about 20 minutes. 
Try I or 2 ; if not tender then, let them boil a little longer. 
The moment they are tender, remove them from the fire. 
Drain off the water ; add a very large lump of sweet, fresh 
butter, a dash of pepper, salt, and (if the peas are not of the 
sweetest) a pinch of sugar. Set them in a warm place until 
the butter melts, and serve very hot. 

N. B. — Boiling uncovered preserves the color. 

If the peas are fresh and good, they will require no more 
dressing than the above. When they begin to be older and 
less sweet, prepare them according to the following receipts. 
A head of lettuce may be added to the above if liked. 

STEWED PEAS. 

PETITS-POIS SAUTES. 

I quart of peas, 3 ounces of butter, 

I ounce of chopped onion, }i ounce of sugar, 

Salt, I gill of water, boiling. 

Cover closely, and stew very gently for 35 minutes. When 
tender, add the butter ; toss it well with the peas and serve 
as soon as it melts. 

N. B. — In this case the color must be sacrificed (by 
covering), as older peas are used and they must be cooked 
in such a way as to make them tender. 

GREEN PEAS. 

PETITS-POIS. 

Shell the peas. Select the youngest. Throw them into 
cold water. Put the pods in a kettle with boiling water, 
19 



290 GOOD-LIVING. 

and boil 30 minutes. Strain the water off and return it to 
the fire in the kettle. Bring to a boil. Drain out the peas 
(they should be of uniform size) and throw them into the boil- 
ing liquid. Do not put on the lid. Boil for 20 to 30 minutes, 
until the peas are tender. Remove them from the fire the 
very moment they are tender enough. Drain off all but 
I gill of the liquid ; add a large lump of butter, pepper, salt, 
a pinch of sugar, and 2 tablespoonfuls of cream. If liked, a 
pinch of flour may be also added, stirred, and boiled 3 
minutes. Pour over the peas and serve. A head of lettuce 
may be added to the above.

Wash the peas in cold water; put them in a saucepan 
with cold water. Bring it to a boil. If canned, boil 20 
minutes; if dried, 2 hours or more, until tender. When 
done, the water should be almost absorbed. When tender, 
press through a colander. Meanwhile put the milk on to boil 
in a farina-kettle with the bay-leaf, chopped onion, cloves, 
parsley, and ham. Rub the butter and flour together until 
smooth. When the milk has boiled 20 minutes, strain it into 
the peas; then put the whole back into the farina-kettle; 
stir in the flour and butter and continue to stir until it 
thickens and boils 3 minutes. Add salt and pepper and 
serve with veal cutlets or small filets, mutton chops, etc., etc. 
Pur^e of limas or other fresh beans may be made in the 
same way. 

N. B. — If dried peas are used, soak overnight; if the 
water boils off too much before they are tender, add more^ 
very little at a time. 



CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN. 29I 

TO BOIL CAULIFLOWER. 

CHOU-FLEUR. 

Trim off the outside leaves, leaving i row around the 
flower. Cut an X in the stalk. Have a large pot of boiling 
water on the fire. Add enough milk to whiten the water ; 
also one level teaspoonful of salt. The cauliflower should 
be left in vinegar and water for 20 to 30 minutes before 
boiling : this system is supposed to draw out any insects that 
may lurk within. Drain it thoroughly; tie it loosely in a 
piece of cheese-cloth large enough to cover it entirely. Put 
it into the boiling water, which must cover it well. Let it 
boil until quite tender, but be careful that it does not go to 
pieces. As cauliflowers vary very much in size, only a gen. 
eral idea of the time required can be given. One of ordi- 
nary size will take about 40 minutes, perhaps more. Wh6n 
cooked, lift it out by the cheese-cloth, drain very thoroughly, 
and set in a round dish. Make a Cream Sauce (see receipt) ; 
pour it over the cauliflower ; cover, and let it stand for a few 
minutes for the sauce to penetrate. Then serve. Or, if a 
handsome specimen, successfully boiled, serve it in a round 
dish with a White Sauce served separately in a sauce-boat. 
Add a squeeze of lemon-juice to the sauce before serving. 
Small cauliflowers will not require more than 30 minutes to 
boil. 

CA ULIFLO WER A U GRA TIN. 

CHOU-FLEUR AU GRATIN. 

Boil the cauliflower as directed. Set it in a round baking- 
dish which can be sent to table. For a moderate-sized cauli- 
flower make i pint of Cream Sauce (see receipt). Add to 
the sauce 2 heaping tablespoons each of grated Parmesan 
and Gruyfere cheese, and a dash of cayenne.. Mix the sauce

crevices. Cover the top with fine, grated bread-crumbs, dor 
with butter, and bake 20 minutes. Serve in the same dish.

BOILED CAULIFLOWER TOMATO SAUCE. 

CHOU-FLEUR, SAUCE TOMATE. 

Having boiled a medium-sized cauliflower very carefully as 
directed, place it on a round dish, after having thoroughly 
drained it. Have ready a' rich Tomato Sauce (see receipt) ; 
pour it around, not over, the cauliflower, and serve as a sep- 
arate course. This is a very pretty dish. Recommended. 

BROCCOLI 
Prepare according to the receipts given for cauliflower. 

WINTER CABBAGE. 
CHOU. 

Cut in 4 ; lay in salted cold water for a little while, trim- 
ming off the outer leaves and stalk. Drain well, and put 
into a large pot of boiling water, allowing ^ an ounce of salt 
to the gallon. Boil very gently, covered, for 10 minutes, then 
remove from the fire ; drain off the water ; re-cover with salted 
boiling water as before, and boil for i hour or more until 
tender. Do not cover the pot after the first 10 minutes. 
Drain very dry ; dress with melted butter, pepper, and salt ; 
or chop it coarsely and cover with a rich Cream Sauce (see 
receipt). If boiled when cut like cold-slaw, it will only 
require about 30 minutes. Drain and dress as above. 

SUMMER CABBAGE. 

CHOU. 

Cut in 2 or 4. Lay in salted cold water to draw out any 
insects that may lurk inside. Drain thoroughly and put into 
a pot of salted boiling water. Do not cover. Boil 30 to 40 
minutes, until tender. Drain very dry in a colander, pressing 
the water out with a plate. Dress with melted butter, 
pepper, and salt, or with Cream Sauce (see receipt). 

N. B. — To avoid the unpleasant odor caused by cooking 
cabbage, use a very large pot and do not fill it too near the 



BSUSSBLS SPSOUTS. 293 

brim with the water, as it is the boiling over which causes 
the disagreeable odor. Another way of overcoming this 
trouble is also suggested, which is to put into the water 
a piece of bread tied in a fine white rag. After it has been 
1 5 minutes in the pot, remove it and throw it immediately 
into the fire to burn, as, in its turn, it becomes very un- 
pleasant. 

STEWED CABBAGE AND CELERY. t 

Cut into shreds equal quantities of cabbage and celery. 
Lay for a few minutes in cold water, then drain and put into 
salted boiling water. Boil gently for 20 or 30 minutes, 
according to the season. Meanwhile prepare a rich Cream 
Sauce (see receipt). Drain the cabbage and celery as dry as 
possible, and stir into the cream sauce. Let it stew very 
gently for 10 minutes, and serve. Recommended. 

STEWED CABBAGE. 

Cut the cabbage like coarse cold-slaw. Add a small piece 
of red pepper (without seeds) and parboil it 10 minutes 
in salted boiling water. Drain dry. Add 3 or 4 table- 
sploonfuls of vinegar, a lump of butter, and 2 large table- 
spoonfuls of stock. Cover closely and simmer gently for 
about 30 minutes, until perfectly tender. Add salt and 
pepper, and serve. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS. 

CHOUX DE BRUXELLES. 

Pick these over carefully, rejecting all the loose, hanging 
leaves. Throw them into cold salted water for at least 15 
minutes to draw out any lurking insects. Have ready on 
the fire a l^rge pot of boiling water with a little Salt in it. 
Having drained the sprouts, put them into the boiling 
water. Do not put on the lid. Boil 12 to 15 or even 20 
minutes, just long enough for the sprouts to be tender all 



294 COOD-UVING. 

through, but by no means soft enough to go to pieces. 
Drain them. I{ow hold them in the colander under the 
cold-water faucet, and let the cold water dash over them, 
then drain very thoroughly, and return to a china-lined 
saucepan with a large lump of butter, pepper, and salt. Set 
on one side of the range where it will warm very gently 
without danger of burning. When well heated, serve in a 
hot dish. 

The above mode of treatment is supposed to preserve the 
color of the sprouts without using any chemicals ; its recom- 
mendation is that the idea comes from the native land of 
Brussels sprouts. 

CANNED VEGETABLES. 

When possible, these should always be rinsed in cold 
water, allowing the stream of watjcr to dash over and through 
them. Then drain and dress to taste. This removes the 
taste of the tin can and freshens the vegetables. 

SUMMER SQUASH. 

It is recommended, instead of peeling and boiling white 
squash, to cut it in sections, removing the seeds and leaving 
the peel on, and bake it in the oven. Baste with butter or 
sweet drippings, and sprinkle with pepper, salt and chopped 
parsley before serving. To boil it, peel, remove the seeds, 
cut in medium-sized pieces, barely cover it with boiling 
water, and boil until tender. Dry it ^/^rj/ thoroughly. Mash 
it through a colander ; add a large lump of butter, pepper, 
and salt, and serve. If will require about 20 minutes to boil. 

The long-necked, white, summer squash is delicious if cut 
and fried exactly like egg-plant or cucumbers. The narrow 
end is best done in this way. 

TURK'S HEAD SQUASH AU GRATIN. 

Bake this as directed above ; rub the soft part through the 
colander ; mix with it a little cream, pepper, and salt. Put

it into a deep dish ; cover the top with grated Parmesan and 
bread-crumbs and bake in the oven for about 10 minutes 
until nicely browned. Serve in the same dish.

6 green sweet peppers.

Broth. 



Cut the stems out very neatly to make the tops., Empty the 
insides of the peppers, being careful to get rid of every seed. 
Be certain the peppers are not of the hot kind, which are 
frequently sold by mistake for the sweet. (If they are hot, 
they must be laid in strong salt and water for 24 hours 
before using. This will take out some of the strong taste.) 
Make a dressing of equal bulks of ham and stale bread- 
crumbs, to which add the parsley, onion, and tomatoes. 
Chop all very fine. In seasoning, only add pepper if re- 
quired. Fill the peppers with the dressing. Cover them 
with the stems, from which you have carefully removed all 
the white part. Place them in a saucepan just large enough 
to hold them closely packed, stem end uppermost. Pour 
over broth enough to cover them a little more than \, and 
simmer very gently for ij hours. Remove them carefully 
to a hot dish. Boil down the gravy briskly for a few min- 
utes, thickening it slightly with a pinch of corn-starch 
blended with cold water. Stir ; boil 3 minutes ; pour over 
the peppers ; serve. 

CORN PUDDING AS A VEGETABLE. 

I dozen grated ears of com, I cup of milk or crMdn 

I tablespoon of brown sugar. Salt to taste:

This is a Southern receipt and very good.

BAKED GREEN-CORN PUDDING. 

12 ears of com scored and scraped, 2 ounces of butter, 

I pint of new milk, 2 eggs, 

Salt and pepper. 

Mix and bake 45 minutes. Use less milk if the corn 
yields a great deal. 

TO BOIL CORN. 

Strip off the husk and silk entirely ; or, strip off all the 
husk except i inner row of leaves, removing every thread of 
the silk. Either way is good. Have ready a large pot of 
boiling water. Never put salt into the water for boiling 
corn; it hardens the outer coating of the grains, making 
them often shrivelled and yellow, besides being much more 
indigestible. Put the corn in the pot ; cover and boil rap- 
idly for about 20 minutes (for large-sized ears) ; then set the 
pot, with the corn in it, upon the hearth and let it stand for 
10 or 15 minutes. Then drain; strip off the leaves, and 
serve in a napkin folded to cover them. There are made, at 
present, extremely dainty, embroidered corn-cloths for this 
purpose, the shape being well designed for covering the corn 
and keeping it hot. 

CORN OYSTERS. 

2 heaping tablespoons of flour, 12 ears of com, 

%, teaspoon of salt, 2 eggs, 

Cayenne, Butter and lard for frying. 

Score the corn and press out all the grains with the back 
of a knife ; this is much better than grating. Beat the eggs, 
whites and yolks apart, until very light. Add first the yolks 
to the corn, then the whites, salt, cayenne, and flour ; mix 
lightly and thoroughly. Have 2 tablespoonfuls of mixed 
lard and butter in the frying-pan. When very hot, drop the 
mixture into the pan by small spoonfuls. Brown i side, 
then turn with a cake-turner, and brown the other. Be sure 



EGG.PLANT BAKED WITH BREAD-CRUMBS. 297 

tile lard is very hot before you put in the batter, or the 
oysters will be grejisy. Drain on brown paper in the mouth 
of the oven, and serve on a cut paper or folded napkin. 

CORN FRITTERS. 

Com cut from 7 ears, 1 pint of milk, 

1 e^ beaten together, Salt and pepper. 

Flour, Lard for frying, 

I teaspoon of baking-powder to each cup of flour. 

Scrape the corn as described above. Mix all together, 
adding enough f!our to make a rather stiff batter. Drop by 
the teaspoonful into deep boiling lard (see General Direc- 
tions for Frying). The lard should be deep enough to float 
the fritters. If they spread too much, after testing i or 2, 
add a little more flour. They should puff like doughnuts. 
Drain dry ; serve on a cut paper or folded napkin. 

N. B. — If the corn yields much milk in scraping, add 
less than designated in the receipt. 

EGG-PLANT BAKED WITH BREAD-CRUMBS. 

AUBERGINE A LA CREOLE. 

I young and tender egg-plant, 2 onions, grated, 

I tablespoon of chopped parsley. Butter, 

1 " " vinegar. Bread-crumbs, 

Pepper, Salt. 

Peel the egg-plant and cut it into inch dice. Put it into a 
saucepan with about i gill of boiling water. Simmer very 
gently until tender, but not entirely done, 10 to 15 minutes. 
Then throw it into a colander and drain as dry as possible, 
squeezing out the water with a saucer. Meanwhile, fry the 
onions in butter ; when the egg-plant is thoroughly drained, 
remove the saucepan and onions from the iire, and stir in 
the egg-plant, parsley, pepper, salt, and vinegar, and as much 
butter as you can spare, about 2 heaping tablespoonfuls. If 
the egg-plant has been properly dried, it will absorb the but- 



298 GOOD.LIVING. 

ter entirely. Put into a baking-dish ; cover the top with 
browned bread-crumbs and dots of butter, and bake 20 to 
25 minutes in a good oven. There should be nearly i 
quart of the stewed egg-plant for the above proportions ; 
therefore, if you have not i large egg-plant, use 2 or more 
smaller ones. Delicious. 

STUFFED EGG-PLANT. 
AUBERGINE FARCIE. 

Prepare exactly as Stuffed Cucumbers (see receipt), only 
do not put the sides together, but round them up with the 
stuffing. Cover the tops with bread-crumbs ; set them in a 
bake-pan, with a lump of butter and 4 tablespoonfuls of 
boiling water. Bake for about i hour, or perhaps a little 
less, until the egg-plant is tender, which fact you can ascer- 
tain by slipping a narrow knife into the inner edge of the 
egg-plant. If the oven is too quick, cover the egg-plant 
with a piece of thick paper or with a tin pie-plate until a 
few minutes before it is done. Remove the egg-plant to a 
dish and set in warm place. Put the pan on the top of the 
range ; add about 2 gills of broth ; stir, and when boiling, 
add a pinch of corn-starch blended with a little cold water. 
Stir and boil for 3 minutes, and serve in a sauce-boat with 
the egg-plant. Or, prepare the inside of the egg-plant 
according to the receipt for Baked Egg-plant ; fill the 
shells with this mixture ; cover with bread-crumbs ; dot with 
butter, and bake from 30 to 45 minutes, until the egg-plant 
is tender. Serve as an entrde. 

FRIED EGG-PLANT. 

AUBERGINE FRITE. 

I young egg-plant, i egg, 

Flour, Lard. 

Under this head, it is well to make an effort to dispel an 
old-fashioned idea which seems to have taken possession of 
the general mind on the subject of this vegetable. Every 
one, with scarcely an exception, will prepare an egg-plant 



STEWED CUCUMBERS. 299 

for frying by carefully cutting it into slices, and piling these, 
with salt between the layers, putting a plate and heavy 
weight on the top. It has been satisfactorily proved by ex- 
perience that this elaborate operation is perfectly unneces- 
sary. If the egg-plant is not too ripe, or not touched by 
the frost, it will never be bitter ; if, on the other hand, it is 
bitter, all the salting and all the pressing you can give it will 
not remove the bitterness. Therefore, spare yourself the 
trouble of the above-described process until you have 
proved by a counter-experience that it is indispensable. I 
have brought in an egg-plant with only time to cook it for 
the dinner, and it has been sweeter than others which have 
been under treatment for hours. The bitterness comes 
entirely from the vegetable being over-ripe or frosted. 

Pick out a young egg-plant. Do not be tempted by the 
size of the extra-large, handsome ones. They are very 
often bitter. The egg-plant should be firm and glossy pur- 
ple. Peel it, if you like. If it is very tender, it is best to 
leave the peel on, as this helps to keep the slices from break- 
ing. Cut it in slices about \ of an inch thick. Dip these 
first in beaten egg and then in flour. Have ready in the 
pan a little boiling lard. When you are certain that it is 
boiling, lay in the slices of egg-plant. Do not cook too 
quickly. In 2 or 3 minutes turn the slices with a cake- 
turner and brown on the second side. Watch it carefully, 
as it scorches very easily. Do not use butter for the frying, 
as it blackens before the egg-plant is cooked. When the 
egg-plant is tender, remove the slices with the cake-turner ; 
lay them on papqr in the mouth of the oven. When dry, 
serve on an open platter. If covered, it will lose all its 
crispness and become limp. Sprinkle with salt and pepper 
and serve.

moved. Peel the cucumbers ; cut them in quarters. If old, 
remove the seeds. Lay the cucumbers in boiling water 
until transparent. Make a rich Cream Sauce (see receipt), 
to which add about \ a grated onion. When ready, drain 
the cucumbers dry and lay them in the sauce. Stew gently 
over boiling water for about 1 5 minutes ; then dish ; sprinkle 
chopped parsley over the top and serve. A teaspoonful of 
chopped chives added with the parsley may take the place 
of the grated onion.

The cucumbers for this may be a little riper than those to

if small. Do not use any that have hard seeds. Dip first 
in egg, then bread-crumbs. Set aside in the ice-box for i 
hour. Have ready the lard heated to boiling point (see 
General Directions for Frying). When you are certain that 
it is boiling, lay in the slices of cucumber. In about 3 min- 
utes, turn them. In about 3 minutes more, when tender, 
remove to a brown paper in the mouth of the oven. When 
dry, serve on an open platter.

or veal and ham (see Force-meats). Fill the cavity left in 
the cucumbers with the dressing. Put the two sides to- 
gether again, and tie securely ; or each side may be rounded 
up with the dressing and covered with crumbs. Lay them

in a saucepan, with about 3 gills of broth. Set them where 
they will simmer very gently, for about i hour, until tender. 
Remove them to a hot dish. Set the saucepan over the 
fire ; add 2 gills more of broth to it ; boil down briskly for 
a few minutes. Thicken slightly with a pinch of corn- 
starch, blended with a little cold water. Stir and boil for 
2 minutes ; pour it around the cucumbers, and serve. 

DRESSED CUCUMBERS. 

CONCOMBRES EN SALADE. 

Select very young cucumbers. Bury them in the ice for 
long enough to chill them thoroughly through ; or, if hur- 
ried, put them in a pan with ice and salt, with their skins on. 
Leave them until the very latest moment before using ; then 
peel ; slice them just aS thin as possible, and, at the moment 
of serving, add vinegar, salt, and cayenne ; add also oil, if 
liked. Do not let them stand in the dressing. If the above , 
rules are strictly and literally followed, you will find that 
cucumbers are far less indigestible than is generally be- 
lieved. They should never be allowed to stand and wilt in 
the dressing.

Fry the cucumbers and onion in butter until nicely

are lightly floured. When brown, add the water. Stew 30 
minutes. Rub together a small teaspoonful of butter and 
I heaping teaspoonful of flour. Add to the cucumbers ; 
stir and boil 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, salt, and pep-

SPINACH AU JUS. 
pur]£e d'epinards au jus. 

This is a dish that is so simple and easy to cook that, like 
tea or coffee, or a dozen other things of the same class, it is 
seldom done well. 

In the first place, select young and tender spinach ; if this 
is not possible, pick it over, carefully tearing off only the 
tender part of the leaf, and rejecting all the spines and 
coarse fibres. Put it on the fire, with about a cupful of 



PIE.PLANT SPINACH. 303 

boiling water to half a peck of spinach. Do not cover the 
saucepan. Let it simmer for 10 minutes. By this time it 
should be quite wilted, and that is all the cooking it re- 
quires ; more would destroy the color, and make it dry and 
tasteless. The following is a most important point in cook- 
ing spinach: when you remove it from the fire, drain it 
perfectly dry. This is where most cooks fail. Press it in a 
colander with a saucer or plate until every drop of moisture 
is pressed out. Some cooks are so energetic as to put it into 
a cloth and wring it dry. In any case it must be absolutely 
free from that disagreeable, green spinach-water, which may 
perhaps do for coloring, but is fit for nought else. Now 
turn it into a chopping-bowl, and chop it as fine as powder. 
Then, if liked, rub it through the colander. This latter 
makes a purde, and is excellent. Now add either a few 
spoonfuls of rich gravy or meat-juice, and a large lump 
of butter, pepper, salt, and a very small pinch of sugar. 
Put it into a saucepan, and, when thoroughly hot, serve it. 
The proper consistency of spinach when dressed is, that it 
should be as soft as it can be and yet retain its shape when 
neatly arranged in a mound. It must be neither too wet 
nor too dry. Garnish with Croutons (see receipt), or with 
hard-boiled eggs, cut in quarters.

PUR&E OF LETTUCE. 

PUR:^E DE lAITUES. 

When your garden yields more lettuce than you can use 
as salad, there are several ways of cooking it which will be 
found very good. One of these is to prepare the lettuce 
exactly the same as spinach, only boiling much longer, until 
perfectly tender. When drained perfectly dry, finish as di- 
rected. In the heat of the summer the coarse leaves are 
often bitter ; it is best to throw them aside and use only 
what is young and tender. 

LETTUCE AU JUS. 
LAITUES AU JUS. 

Wash the heads thoroughly without breaking. Cut all of 
uniform length and tie each lightly together. Lay them 
side by side in a buttered pan. Slice \ an onion ; lay it and 
I bay-leaf in the pan, and half-cover the lettuce with strong 
stock. Cover the pan air-tight. Stew very gently. Or, the 
pan may be stood in a slow oven. Open it from time to 
time and add a little stock as it cooks away, but very little 
at a time. Allow about 2 hours of slow cooking in the 
oven, and frequent feeding as directed. Take them out, 
remove the strings, and lay the heads of lettuce in an even 
row on a flat dish. Set the pan again on the range ; add a 
gill of broth ; let it boil briskly for a few minutes. Thicken 
it slightly with a pinch of corn-starch blended with a few 
drops of cold water ; stir, and boil 3 minutes. Or the gravy 
may be thickened with a little Brown Roux (see receipt). 
Strain the gravy over the lettuce, and serve. 

STRING-BEANS. 
HARICOTS VERTS. 

Select very young beans to boil ; they must be fresh as 

well as young, and snap when bent. Tip and tail them, 

drawing off the strings. There are such excellent stringless 
so 



306 GOOD-LIVmG. 

beans grown now, that it seems almost a pity to waste so 
much time over those that have to be strung. Cut. them, if 
broad, in halves, both in length and breadth ; if small, across 
once or twice. Throw into cold water for 30 minutes. Bring 
a kettle of water to a boil. Make it quite salt. When 
boiling rapidly, throw in the beans, which you have drained 
dry. !^^et them boil rapidly for 20 minutes if very young, 
longer, 30 to 45, if older. Do not put the lid on the kettle. 
When tender, drain free of all moisture. Return to the 
saucepan with a large lump of butter, a teaspoonful of vin- 
egar, salt, pepper, and a tablespoonful of parsley chopped 
as fine as powder. Set in a warm place until the butter 
is melted, and serve. 

LIMA BEANS. 

Select very young beans ; the younger the better. The 
almost universal mistake is made of allowing these beans to 
fill out and grow too large. Use only very small ones, sorting 
as you shell them. The larger ones will make delicious 
soup (see Purde of Limas and Tomatoes). Throw the small 
ones into cold water. Have a large kettle of slighty-salted 
boiling water. Throw in the beans and boil 40 to 60 min- 
utes, according to their age. Drain dry. Return to the fire 
with pepper, salt, butter (and \ of an onion grated and 
fried in butter if liked), and stew for 10 or 15 minutes very 
gently. Or, drain after boiling ; add cream, butter, pepper, 
and salt, and stew 10 or 15 minutes. In either case serve 
with parsley chopped as fine as powder.

until they will mash easily under pressure, about ij to 2 
hours longer. When tender, remove the ham, and press 
the beans, etc., through the colander. Return them to the

beans. The above old-fashioned receipt allows for i quart 
of small, dried, white beans. 

CREOLE BEANS AND BACON. 

t quart of red beans, I onion, cut very fine, 

y^ pound of fine bacon. Cold water to cover. 

Pepper, Salt. 

Soak the beans overnight and cook exactly according to 
receipt for Pork and Beans. Leave the bacon in i square 
piece. When it has boiled perfectly tender, which will 
probably be before the beans, take it out ; skin and set 
aside until the beans are very tender. Place the bacon in 
the centre of a baking-dish ; drain the beans and put them 
around the bacon ; fill to the top of the beans with the 
liquor in which they boiled. Bake i^ to 2 hours, until the 
liquid is nearly all absorbed. Recommended.

I quart of large chestnuts, i quart of stock or water, 

I tablespoon of butter, Salt and pepper. 

Shell the chestnuts, and throw into boiling water until 
the skins come off easily. Drain and skin. Put them into 
a saucepan with the stock or water ; boil about 30 minutes, 
until quite soft. Press through a colander; add butter, 
pepper, and salt. It should be of the consistency of soft 
mashed potato. Return to the fire. Stir, and when very 
hot, serve. Good with veal sautd, dindonneau (turkey- 
chick), etc.

the butter in a saucepan ; add the lentils, pepper, and salt. 
Stew gently for 15 minutes. Add i teaspoonful each of 
parsley and chives, chopped as fine as powder, and serve. 

SAMP. 

Select very white and evenly-cracked samp. Wash it. 
Soak it overnight in lukewarm water. Next day, throw 
that water off ; cover with fresh cold water ; bring gradually 
to a boil, and boil gently for 5 hours. As the water becomes 
absorbed, add fresh boiling water from time to time. When 
tender all through, drain off the water ; put the samp into 
the farina-kettle with milk enough to make it quite soft ; 
stew gently, with the cover off, for i hour, until the milk is 
absorbed and the samp creamy. Add a good quantity of 
salt and a large lump of butter. When the butter is melted, 
serve. 

N. B. — Be certain the samp is quite tender before the 
milk is added. 

FRIED SAMP. 

When cold (prepared as above), form into cakes ; dip in 
egg and flour, and fry in hot butter until quite brown. 
Excellent for breakfast.

FRENCH OR GLOBE ARTICHOKES. 

ARTICHAUTS. 

Cut the stalk close, then, with a pair of scissors, trim 
the sharp points from the leaves, removing not more than 
\ an inch from each. Wash in cold water and vinegar, to 
draw out any lurking insects. Have ready a pot of salted 
boiling water. Lay in the artichokes, and boil very gently, 
until you can draw out a leaf easily, but do not let them go 
to pieces. Drain them upside-down until dry. Then serve 
hot with HoUandaise Sauce, or cold with Tartare Sauce, or 
with Plain French Dressing (see receipts). The time for 
boiling will vary with the size and age of the vegetable, from 
25 minutes to i hour. 

TO BOIL ONIONS. 

Cut a small slice from top and bottom of each onion, 
selecting white ones for the purpose. Peel them in a bowl 
under water. Put them into a china-lined saucepan, with 
boiling water to cover. In 1 5 minutes throw this water off, 
and replace it with fresh boiling water and i teaspoonful of 
salt ; boil until the onions are tender enough to pierce with 
a straw. This will require from 40 to 60 minutes for 
medium-sized onions. The very large Spanish require much 
longer. Drain. Serve with melted butter, pepper, and salt. 
The best onions for boiling are the Bermudas. 

ONIONS WITH CREAM SA UCE. 

OGNONS A LA CR£mE. 

Having prepared as above, boil until quite tender, but not 
entirely done. Have ready a Cream Sauce (see receipt). 
Drain the onions, and lay them in the sauce. Set on one 
side of the fire, over a kettle of boiling water {bain-marie), 
and stew gently for fully 30 minutes, until the onions begin 
to go to pieces. Young Bermuda onions prepared in this 
way are very delicate. 



GLAZED ONIO/fS. 313 

ONIONS BAKED AND BROWNED. 

Cut a slice from the top and bottom of each, and peel 
them in a bowl of water. Use Bermudas, if possible. Have 
ready a pot of salted boiling water; add enough milk to 
whiten the water. Put in the onions, and boil until quite 
tender, from 40 to 60 minutes. Drain. Lay them in a 
bake-pan ; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar ; 
add a little of the liquor in which the onions were boiled, 
and bake in the oven until the onions are nicely browned. 

GLAZED ONIONS. 

OGNONS GLACIS. 

15 onions, I cup of consommd, 

Z teaspoon of sugar, I large tablespoon of butter. 

Salt. 

Peel the onions in a bowl of water, cutting the skin not 
too close to top or bottom, lest they should go to pieces in 
cooking. Take a saucepan large enough for all the onions 
to fit in the bottom side by side. Put in the butter, and, 
when it is melted, place the onions in it. They should be 
of uniform size. Sprinkle with the sugar, and moisten with 
the consomm6, which should be strong and well-flavored. 
Add salt. Cover and set on the side of the range, where 
they will stew gently for about i hour. By the time the 
onions are tender all through, the broth should have cooked 
down to a glaze. If not quite brown enough, uncover and 
set the saucepan in the oven for a few minutes. Remove 
the onions to a dish. Set the saucepan on the top of the 
range ; add a little fresh consomm^ ; stir it around ; boil 
and strain over the onions. The sauce may be very slightly 
thickened, when boiling, with a pinch of corn-starch, dis- 
solved in a little cold water. Stir and boil 3 minutes. Use 
the onions as a garnish for beef, veal, etc. 



314 GOOD-LIVING. 

SPANISH ONIONS BAKED. 

These are the very large, white-skinned onions. Put 
them, unpeeled, in a pot of salted boiling water, and boil 
rapidly i hour. Then wipe dry ; roll in greased papers 
which you twist at the 2 ends to keep in the steam, and 
bake from l to 2 hours. If very large, boil longer before 
baking. When baked, remove the papers ; peel the onions, 
and serve with butter, pepper, and salt ; or with a rich 
Brown Sauce (see receipt). 

PLAIN BOILED OKRA. 

GOMBOS. 

Cut off the stems, nearly up to the shoulder ; do not tip 
them unless the points are discolored. Put them whole 
(they should never be more than 2\ inches long for plain 
boiling) in a china-lined saucepan with salted boiling water. 
If boiled in iron, the okra will turn black. Boil 20 to 30 
minutes until perfectly tender, but do not let them break. 
Drain off the water. They are now ready to be dressed, 
according to taste. 

OKRA STEWED. 

GOMBOS SAUTES.

BEETS. 

BETTERAVES. 

Winter beets should be soaked overnight and boiled until 
tender, anywhere from 3 to 6 hours. Do not touch them 
with a knife until they are boiled, or their color will be de- 
stroyed. Winter beets should be peeled when cooked very 
tender, sliced and served with a lump of butter melted with 
vinegar, pepper, and salt poured over them. Or, served 
cold, sliced, with vinegar, pepper, and salt. Set them 
away for a few hours before serving in this way, for the 
vinegar to penetrate them. They will keep for some time, 
and are excellent to mix with salads, and useful as a 
garnish. 

Summer beets require less time to boil, i hour being 
sufficient for small ones. If very small, serve whole, peeled, 
with butter and vinegar as above ; those of medium size 
should be cut in 4.

BOILED RICE. 323 

CREOLE RECEIPT FOR BOILING RICE. 

RIZ PERLjfi 

Wash the rice in 3 waters ; rub' it dry in a clean cloth after 
the last washing. Have ready a deep saucepan of boiling 
water ; sprinkle the rice into it. The water should be deep 
enough to allow the grains to play about freely. Do not 
cover. After boiling 20 minutes, test several grains to see 
that all are tender at the heart. If not, boil 2 or 3 minutes 
longer, about 22 minutes in all. Remove from the fire ; 
throw it into a colander. When drained perfectly dry, put 
it into a saucepan with a large lump of butter, say i table- 
spoonful to I cup of raw rice, and plenty of salt. Stand 
it where it will get as much heat as it can without scorching. 
Do not cover. Do not stir. Every now and again turn it 
lightly from the bottom with a fork, and scatter any lumps 
that form. In about forty minutes, if exposed to sufficient 
heat, the rice will be dried so that every grain stands by it- 
self. Should the rice be boiled even a little too soft, it will 
take much longer to dry. Should it look pasty, when drained, 
hold it under the cold-water faucet and let the cold water 
dash through it ; then shake dry, put into the saucepan with 
butter, and finish as above. The above receipt is one that 
has been in daily and successful use for many years. When 
well cooked, every grain should be separate and saturated 
with butter. 

BOILED RICE. 

'S.YL. 

Have ready on the fire a large pot of boiling water. Wash 
the rice, and sprinkle it in. Add salt. Boil rapidly, so that 
the water tosses the grains about loosely for 25 minutes 
without touching. Then, if perfectly tender, throw it into 
the colander, and leave it over the pot of hot water to steam 
for 10 minutes. Dish and serve. JJever cover it, either 
while cooking or when served. 



SALADS AND DRESSINGS. 
SIDNEY SMITH'S SALAD DRESSING. 

" Two large potatoes, passed through kitchen sieve. 
Smoothness and softness to the salad give ; 
Of mordent mustard add a single spoon, 
Distrust the condiment that bites too soon ; 
But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault, 
To add a double quantity of salt : 
Four times the spoon with Oil of Lucca crown, 
And twice with vinegar procured from " town "; 
True flavor needs it, and your poet begs 
The pounded yellow of two well-boiled eggs. 
Let onion's atoms lurk within the bowl, 
And, scarce suspected, animate the whole. 
And, lastly, in the flavor'd compound toss 
A magic spoonful of Anchovy Sauce. 
Oh ! great and glorious, and herbaceous treat, 
'T would tempt the dying anchorite to eat. 
Back to the world he 'd turn his weary soul, 
And plunge his fingers in the Salad-bowL"

than indicated above, but, if so, add them very carefully, as 
it is easy to use too much water. Then begin to add the 
oil, drop by drop at first ; more boldly after a few minutes. 
Every time there is any appearance of " cracking " or curd- 
ling, add a few drops of vinegar, and work briskly until it 
smooths out again. The quantity of oil is only approxi- 
mate, for, after a little experience of the management of it 
and the vinegar, it will be found that the same amount of 
mustard can be made to hold more oil. This dressing is 
a general favorite for celery salad, fish salad, tomatoes, 
etc., etc., and deservedly so, as it is much more reliable 
than the mayonnaise, which it closely resembles in appear- 
ance. With plenty of patience, and management in the 
alternate use of the vinegar and oil, it is certain to s.ucceed 
where, especially in summer, mayonnaise fails, often unac- 
countably. This dressing, if made in larger quantity, can 
be kept in a glass jar on ice for i or even 2 weeks. If the 
oil separates at all, it can always be rubbed smooth again 
with a few drops of vinegar. Recommended. 

DRESSING FOR COLD-SLA W. 

1 tablespoon of dry mustard, ]^ teaspoon of salt, 
^ teaspoon of sugar, 2 gills of warm water, 

2 eggs, I gill of vinegar, 

I scant gill of oil, cream, or melted butter. 

Mix together sugar, salt, mustard, and water ; stir smooth 
and add the oil. Set over the fire and boil up once, stirring 
steadily. Remove from the fire and beat it into the eggs, 
which are already beaten together in a bowl. Return the 
sauce to the fire, setting it over -boiling water. Stir until 
smooth and thick, then add the vinegar. When cold, use for 
slaw, cold meats, etc. This is a very old-fashioned receipt.

FRENCH SALAD DRESSING. 

I tablespoon of vinegar, 3 tablespoons of best olive oil, 

X saltspoon of pepper, ]^ saltspoon of salt. 

Mix well together in a cup and pour over the salad at the 

last moment ; mix through and serve. Be careful not to 

crush the lettuce in mixing. The proportion of vinegar 

varies with the salad to be dressed, lettuce and doucette 

(corn-salad) requiring very little, while others require even 

more than the above allowance. If the dressing is mixed 

upon the salad, add the ingredients in the following order : 

First pour over the oil. Mix. Then put into the spoon the 

vinegar ; add to it the salt and pepper ; mix these in the 

spoon until dissolved, then sprinkle over the salad ; mix and 

serve. Observe this rule, and you will find that it makes a 

great difference in the excellence of the salad. 

LETTUCE SALAD. 

SALADE DE LAITUES. 

To crisp the lettuce, take a pan of cold water, dip the

salad-basket to dry the lettuce. Pick over the lettuce care- 
fully to see that it is perfectly clean, stripping off the larger 
leaves, and leaving the heart intact. Lay all in a thin, clean 
towel ; fold it up loosely and set in the ice-box until required. 

N. B. — Handle it as little and as lightly as possible. Dress 
it at the last moment with plain French Dressing (see 
receipt). It must not stand after being mixed, or it will 
wilt. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters.

pieces with a fancy vegetable-cutter, if possible. They 
should be well drained and iced. Arrange the different col- 
ors in a round dish, starting from the centre, like rays, 
red, white, green, 2 of each. If 8 sections are preferred, 
add 2 more white, repeating those given, or using Jerusalem 
artichokes and potatoes. The proper thing to use for the 
central point is the lower part of the French globe arti- 
choke (fonds d'artichauts) ; but as this is not always ob- 
tainable, it may be replaced by a pretty, pale-green lettuce 
heart. Mix the dressing ; pour it over the salad ; set away 

2 hours ; add the heart of lettuce at the last moment, and 
serve very cold. This is a pretty dish for supper, and is 
good served with cold game.

SAVORY RELISHES. 
WELSH RARE-BIT. 

2 cups of grated cheese, 2 eggs, yolks only, 

1 gill of milk or porter. Salt and cayenne to taste. 

Cut thin, square slices of bread ; remove the crusts and 
toast them. While hot, butter generously, and moisten with 
a few teaspoonfuls of boiling water. Keep them hot while 
the rare-bit is being prepared. Stand the milk (wine or 
porter) in a china-lined saucepan over a moderate fire ; when 
boiling, add the cheese (fresh American cheese is best) ; stir 
constantly until the cheese is ^entirely dissolved. Add cay- 
enne and salt. Have the yolks of eggs beaten to a cream. 
Stir them rapidly into the cheese, and pour immediately 
over the hot toast. Serve quickly on a hot-water plate or 
very hot dish, as standing spoils it. If the cheese is not very 
rich, add a lump of butter the size of a walnut. Beer, ale, 
or porter should always accompany Welsh rare-bit. 

Note. — Should the rare-bit be stringy, it is due to the fact 
of the cheese not being sufficiently rich.

immediately on a hot-water plate for luncheon or supper. 

INDIAN SANDWICHES. 

Prepare thin slices of bread as for toast. Cut them round 
with a sharp tin cutter. Fry as Croiltons (see receipt). Take 
some very finely-minced chicken ; mix with it an equal quan- 
tity of ham or tongue ; stir in 2 tablespoonfuls of thick White 
Sauce (see receipt), in which have been blended curry-pow- 
der, and lemon-juice to taste. Warm in a stewpan. Place 
a spoonful of the mixture between every 2 slices of toast. 
Arrange on a folded napkin or cut paper and serve hot. 

N. B. — The filling should be of the consistency of soft 
paste ; it must not run. Very good for luncheon or supper. 

SCOTCH WOODCOCK. 

Chop 2 hard-boiled eggs fine ; put them into a saucepan 
with I tablespoonful of butter melted with 2 of anchovy 
sauce. When dissolved, serve on small rounds of buttered 
toast neatly arranged on a hot-water plate. Do not boil, but 
heat thoroughly. 

BOMBAY TOAST. 

Put a large spoonful of butter in a saucepan over boiling 
water ; as it melts, stir in 2 eggs, cayenne, essence of anchovy, 
and a few chopped capers. Stir until the eggs begin to set. 
Spread on small rounds of buttered toast. Serve on a hot- 
water plate as above.

SALTED ALMONDS. 

Select the best paper-shelled almonds. Remove the shells. 
Put them in a bowl. Poiir boiling water over them and let 
stand for 15 or 20 minutes. By that time the skins will slip 
off easily. Skin them. Lay the almonds on a tiri pie-plate 
without drying them. Sprinkle thickly with salt and turn 
them over that the salt may touch all sides. Place them in 
a moderately-hot oven, shaking occasionally, and turning the 
pan, if one side browns quicker than the other. When golden 
brown, remove them from the oven. Pick out the almonds 
and throw aside the extra salt that remains. 

Some authorities advocate dipping first in white of egg, 
then in salt ; but experience of this method has shown that 
the almonds take up too thick a coating of salt to be 
agreeable. 

A great addition to the above receipt is to put i teaspoon- 
ful of olive oil to i cupful of shelled almonds, which have 
been dried in a cloth. Let each nut receive its coating of 
the oil ; then add about i heaping teaspoonful of salt, and 
finish as above. Almonds prepared according to this last 
method are delicious. 




ORDER OF SERVICE OF A DINNER. 

As it does not enter into the plan of the present work to give 
a list of menus, it may not be amiss to give a general outline of 
the proper order of service of dinner, (see below) leaving the 
hostess to select the dishes. One suggestion offered is, .that, 
in the composition of a menu repetition should be avoided ; 
do not allow any two white sauces, or brown sauces, any two 
friedmeats,orfriedfish and meat, to follow each other so closely 
cis to be noticeable. It is advisable, also, to select such dishes 
as the cook is perfectly familiar with ; that, when required 
to give her attention to the entertainment of her guests, the 
hostess may not be preoccupied with fears of how Bridget may 
see fit to interpret some new receipt. Again, do not attempt 
too complicated or lengthy a menu, for it is not quantity 
which makes a successful dinner, but quality, tasteful arrange- 
ment and garnishing, and neat, orderly service. 

Form of menu for 6 or 8 persons : 

Raw Oysters or Clams. 

Soup, such as Consomm^ or Bisque, etc, 

Hors d'CEuvre; Olives, Radishes, Celery. 

Fish, such as Sheepshead, Sauce Hollandaise, with Potatoes au Court Bouillon. 

I or 2 Entrees, such as Croquettes, Vol-au-vent, Sweetbreads ; or, 

Filets Mignons, Salmi, etc., etc. 

Vegetable, such as Cauliflower with Tomato Sauce, Celery au Jus, etc. 

Roast, such as Saddle of Mutton, with vegetable, such as green peas. 

Game and Salad. 

Dessert ; Ices, Cakes, etc., etc. 

Coffee and Liqueurs. 

N. B. — Should Game not be used, serve the Salad with the Roast in place of 
the vegetable there mentioned. Should cheese be used, serve after dessert. 

For a dinner of 12 or more persons there may be added to 
the above a Bouchd of some kind after the Hors d CEuvre ;

and, if liked, Roman Punch may be served between the 
Roast and Game. If 2 soups should be required for a large 
dinner, let one be a clear Consommd or Bouillon, the other 
a Bisque or Purde. For the family dinner, the above may, of 
course, be modified according to requirements. 




RELISHES FOR BREAKFAST. 

The following suggestions are . offered as an assistance 
in ordering breakfast. The receipts will be readily found 
by reference to the index. The receipts for cooking the 
various cereals, such as oatmeal, cracked-wheat, etc., are not 
given, as each package has upon it the directions for its use, 
which vary so much with the different modes of preparing 
the same cereals for market, that it has been deemed unwise 
to fix any rules for them in the present work.

Butter a fire-proof plate or pie-tin ; carefully break upon 
it as many eggs as it will hold side by side. Sprinkle with 
pepper and salt. Put in the oven until the white is set, 
about 5 minutes. To make more perfect, heat the kitchen 
shovel red-hot and hold it close over the eggs for a few 
seconds, until the yolks also are slightly set, then serve im- 
mediately. They must not stand. If preferred, sift grated 
cheese over the top. This makes a nice dish for luncheon.

Having prepared the eggs as for Eggs sur le Plat, have 
ready heated a rich Tomato Sauce, which pour over the 
eggs. Set in the oven i minute, and serve very hot. 

N.B. — The eggs must be set firm, as described, before the 
sauce is added. 

EGGS A LA TRIPE. 

CEUFS A LA TRIPE. 

Boil the number of eggs required as directed for Hard, 
boiled Eggs. When cold, cut in quarters. Prepare a sauce 
as follows: Stew i chopped onion in i tablespoonful of 
butter gently, until tender ; add salt and pepper, i heaping 
teaspoonful of flour blended with i cup of cream or rich 
milk, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar. Boil gently 
for 5 minutes, stirring continually. When thick and smooth, 
pour the sauce over the eggs, and serve very hot. 

PLAIN OMELET. 

OMELETTE. 

3 eggs, 2 tablespoons of milk, 

X teaspoon of flour, Salt and pepper, . 

Butter size of a pigeon's egg. 

Separate the yolks and whites of eggs. Beat the yi)lk5 
smooth ; then add to them milk, pepper and salt, and pinch 
of flour ; beat to a cream. Now beat the whites to a stiff 
froth ; then beat together the whites and yolks until 
perfectly smooth and not too frothy. Have the butter 
melted in a very smooth, medium-sized frying-pan, which 
should be hot but not scorching. Pour in the mixture ; let 
it stand , a minute or two ; then loosen the edges with a 
knife ; shake the pan occasionally to prevent sticking. Then 
draw the pan a little aside, where it will cook more slowly. 



352 GOOD-LIVING. 

When the edges seem to be quite set, the pan with the 
omelet may be put into the oven for about i minute to set 
the centre, but this is not indispensable. Now fold the 
omelet in 2 or 3, making it long and narrow. Turn a 
hot dish downward over the omelet ; with a quick move- 
ment turn both pan and dish over ; garnish the omelet 
with parsley and serve immediately, or it will fall. The 
chief points in making a good omelet are these: The 
eggs should be perfectly fresh, the pan perfectly smooth, 
not too hot, and well-greased on bottom and sides with but- 
ter ; the heat of the fire should be so managed as to neither 
scorch the outside by too quick a heat, before the centre is 
cooked, nor make it tough and leathery by too little heat. 
A successfully-made omelet should always be slightly 
" fluffy " in the centre, but must be more flaky than fluffy 
through the rest ; therefore, beat the yolks and whites well 
together before cooking ; last, but not least, serve it the 
moment it is done. 

OMELET WITH TOMATO SAUCE. 

OMELETTE, SAUCE TOMATE. 

Make a Plain Omelet, or, Parsley Omelet (see receipts).

in very hot butter until slightly browned. Keep them hot 
while you prepare the omelet. Beat the yolks and whites 
of the eggs separately. To the yolks add parsley, salt, 
pepper, milk, and flour, beating very smooth. Melt i table- 
spoonful of butter and beat that into the eggs. Mean- 
while have the omelet-pan (a large one for the above 
quantity), heating on the fire with 2 tablespdonfuls of butter. 
Do not let the pan get too hot. Do not allow the butter to

354 GOOD.LIVING. 

fry, simply to heat quietly. Now beat the whites vigorously 
into the yolks; beat until thoroughly mixed and quite 
smooth. Pour the mixture into the pan, which must be 
placed where it will have an even, steady, but not too 
intense heat. Detach the edges of the omelet with a knife. 
When set firm enough, lay the hot oysters across the 
centre ; fold the omelet ; dish, and serve immediately.

added the remaining gravy of the kidneys, and a little more 
wine if necessary. Serve immediately. Recommended. 

TRUFFLE OMELET. 

OMELETTE AUX TRUFFES. 

Make a Plain Omelet (see receipt). Slice the truffles ; heat

358 GOOD-LIVING. 

it in the overt for 2 minutes. Take it out ; add the rest of the

longer. Excellent. 

OMELET WITH SWEETMEATS. 

OMELETTE AUX CONFITURES. 
Plain Omelet (see receipt), 2 gills of preserves. 

Make the omelet as directed, omitting pepper and add- 
ing a pinch of salt and a little powdered sugar to the yolks. 
When ready to fold, spread the preserves in a row across the 
centre ; fold and dish. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Heat 
the kitchen poker red-hot, and hold it diagonally across the 
top of the omelet in 3 places, for an instant. This burns 
the sugar and gives to the omelet the appearance of having 
been broiled. Peach marmalade, strawberry preserves, or 
plum jam are best for the purpose. Excellent. 

TO BOIL EGGS. 

CEUFS A LA COQUE. 

Put your eggs in a bowl which can be sent to table. When 
the kettle is boiling, pour the boiling water over the eggs. It 
is essential that the water should be boiling. Stand for 5 
minutes. Drain. Add more boiling water. Let stand again 
5 minutes and serve. 

This way of boiling eggs, though so simple, is going out of 
fashion in these days ; unfortunately, as it makes a wonder- 
ful difference, not only in the appearance of the egg when 
broken open, but, above all, in its digestibility. For the use 
of invalids, eggs should never be boiled in any other way. 

SMOKED BEEF AND EGGS. 

I cup of smoked beef, I teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 

6 eggs. 

Put the beef in a frying-pan with boiling water to cover ; 
scald 5 minutes. Throw off the water ; add a small lump of 
butter. Break the eggs, meanwhile, into a bowl ; beat until 



TO BOIL EGGS HARD. 359 

smooth ; add i tablespoonful of milk, a dash of pepper, and 
pour the eggs into the pan with the beef and butter. Stir 
them over a moderately-hot fire, always scraping the egg 
from the bottom of the pan. Remove the pan from the fire 
a little before it is firm enough, and continue to scrape the 
egg from the bottom, as it will continue to harden. Serve for 
breakfast. 

BAKED EGGS. 

CEUFS FARCIS. 

6 eggs, boiled, i egg, raw, 

2 tablespoons of finely-chopped chicken, J/^ teaspoon of ground mace, 

2 mushrooms, chopped. Salt and pepper, 

I tablespoon of finely-chopped parsley, i large slice of ham. 

Boil the Eggs Hard as described (see receipt). When cold, 
cut in half, crosswise. Remove a little slice from the bottom 
to make them stand. Take out the yolks ; rub them smooth 
and add to them chicken, mushrooms, parsley, and season- 
ings, mixing well. Fill the whites with this, rounding up 
the tops. Brush with the yolk of the raw egg and set in the 
oven to brown. Cut a thin slice of boiled ham ; heat it 
in the frying-pan ; divide it into 1 2 small squares. When the 
tops of the eggs are browned, set them on a hot dish with a 
piece of ham under each. Pour Cream Sauce (see receipt) 
around, not over, the eggs, and serve very hot. A pretty dish 
ifor luncheon* 

TO BOIL EGGS HARD. 

If to eat plain boiled, put the eggs into a saucepan of boil- 
ing water and boil from 6 to 10 minutes. If they are to be 
dressed and served cut in sections, they should be put into a 
saucepan of boiling water and boiled rapidly for 25 minutes ; 
throw the water off then, and allow cold water to run over 
them 2 or 3 minutes ; then set aside in fresh cold water 20 or 
30 minutes. If managed in this way, the whites will not 
break as easily, nor the yolks crumble as much, when cut. 
To remove the shells, roll them gently on the table-until the 
shell is cracked closely all over ; then you can draw off skin, 
shell and all, without marring the surface of the egg.

the frying-pan aside ; drop in the eggs ; set the pan where it 
will simmer very gently, until the eggs are set firm ; pour 
some of the boiling water with a spoon over the yolk of 
each egg, just enough to make a thin film of white. When . 
set firm, remove with a skimmer, putting i egg on each 
slice of toast. Trim off the ragged edges ; sprinkle a dash 
of pepper on the very centre of each egg, and serve very 
hot. Do not let them stand. 

N. B. — Do not let the water boil while the eggs are cook,

HAM AND EGGS. 

CEUFS AU JAMBON. 

The ham for this should be previously boiled. Cut slices 
of medium thickness, i for each egg; lay the ham in a 
hot frying-pan; fry for 2 or 3 minutes on each side, until 
the fat is transparent, then lay it on a hot platter. Break 
the eggs, I by I, into a saucer. Put each into the frying-pan 
and fry until the white is quite set. The fat of the ham is 
generally sufficient for frying the eggs ; if not, add a lump 
of butter. Remove the eggs ; lay each on a separate piece 
of ham. If the eggs merge into each other in the pan, cut 
them neatly apart with the edge of the cake-turner. Serve 
hot. This is a national dish of Holland.

CEUFS A L'AURORE. 

8 e^s, I tablespoon of chopped chives, 

I tablespoon of chopped parsley, i pint of Cream Sauce, 

Salt, Pepper. 

Put the eggs into boiling water, and let them boil rapidly 
25 minutes. Drain ; let the cold water run on them a few 
minutes ; then cover with cold water and set aside 20 to 30 
minutes. Have ready the Cream Sauce (see receipt) ; stir 
into it parsley, chives, pepper, and salt. Now cut the eggs 
in quarters lengthwise ; remove the yolks, which you throw 
into a coarse sieve. Place the whites on a platter, making 
an even row all round near the edge, with the points turned 
outward and upward; fill in the centre in the same way. 
Pour the hot cream sauce over these, covering all except 



362 GOOD.LIVING. 

the outer half of the row of whites on the edge of the dish. 
Now, with a potato-masher, rub the yolks through the 
sieve, scattering them evenly all over the sauce, still leaving 
visible the points of the whites. Have ready on the fire a 
pot of boiling water ; stand the dish of eggs over this for 
about 5 minutes till well-heated again. Serve. If it has 
been done quickly, the sauce will not have had time to cool, 
and the eggs will soon warm. If you have a double dish 
with a hot-water compartment, use it for the above. This 
will be found not only delicious, but very pleasing to the 
eye, and most simple to make. 

CURRIED EGGS.

BUTTER, CHEESE, ETC. 

BUTTER. 

The golden rule of good butter-making is : Keep all your 
utensils absolutely clean and pure ; do not spare time or 
trouble in the attainment of this primary necessity. The 
milk pans should shine like silver, and be kept airing and 
sunning until required for use. Before straining the milk 
into the pan, first scald, then rinse the pan in cold water. It 
need not be wiped after this last. The milk should be strained 
into the pan just as soon as possible after the milking ; it 
should not stand in the kettle. The cream should be allowed 
to stand in the pan 24 hours before skimming, if possible, as 
it will be firmer and richer, but may be skimmed, if the milk 
is required for use, after 12 hours ; however, leave it as long 
as you can afford to. Skim it into a sweet, clean, scalded, 
and rinsed crock, not into any tin vessel. Do not cover the 
crock unless with an inverted sieve. It must have air. Keep 
the crock in a cold place. In summer, churn, if possible, 
every second day ; every third day at the longest. While 
you are preparing your churning apparatus, take the cream 
from the ice (unless the weather is intensely warm) and set 
it where it will attain a temperature of about 65°. If you 
have no thermometer for the purpose, you can soon learn to 
know by the feeling, if you put your finger into the cream. 
It should feel neither cold nor yet even mildly warm. Have 
the churn, like every thing else about the butter, the very 
essence of cleanliness. Scald it first thoroughly, as also the 
butter-paddle and bowl. This swells the wood and prevents 
the grease from getting into the pores. Then thrpw the boil- 

369 



373 GOOD.LIVING. 

ing water out and rinse with cold water until it feels perfectly 
cold to the touch. Empty out the cold water ; turn in the 
cream ; close the cover (if a revolving churn) and turn the 
crank moderately-quickly. The warmer the weather, th? 
slower should be the churning. If churned too rapidly, the 
butter will be oily ; if too slowly, it will take a very long 
time to come. With the cream at 65° of 68°, the churn well 
cooled, and proper rate of turning, the butter should sepa- 
rate from the milk, or "crack," in 20 minutes. Then churn 
very slowly for a few minutes more, until it gathers in little 
balls as large as a good-sized marble ; then swing the dasher 
back and forth until the butter gathers in one or two large 
lumps. Do not work at it too much or it will get soft and 
the texture be spoiled. Draw out the bung and let off the 
buttermilk into a pail. Put back the bung and fill the churn 
up to the crank with iced or very cold spring water. Turn very 
slowly until the milk is quite thoroughly washed out of the 
butter. Remove the bung and draw off this water. Remove 
the crank and dasher. Then lift out the butter, which you 
place in the wooden bowl, which has been prepared as di- 
rected. If the butter appears to retain any milk, work it 
once in a little very cold water ; sprinkle with dairy salt, 
about I saltspoonful to i lb. ; work this in a little and set 
the whole thing in the ice for 2 or 3 hours. Then it may be 
worked once more with a little more salt to taste, made into 
pats, and set away in the ice-box for use. 

Too much working will make the butter oily and destroy 
its texture, as well as its flavor. Unless it is to be packed to 
keep, there is no object in much working or washing. Wash- 
ing once or twice after it is churned is all that is required. 
Some butter-makers use as many as 4 changes of water, and 
in many cases wash out flavor as well as buttermilk. 

N. B. — If the butter is inclined to oil, and not crack, from 
the high temperature of the weather or from too rapid churn- 
ing, put in a lump of ice and a pinch of salt. It is a good 
plan, in hot weather, when the " pin-heads " begin to appear, 
to throw in about J a pint of very cold water. 



COTTAGE CHEESE OR SCHMIER-KASE. 37I 

If, on the other hand, the weather is cold and the butter 
will not gather, but remains in ." pin-heads," you will be 
obliged to throw in a little boiling water and churn more 
rapidly. But the necessity for this should be avoided by 
raising the cream to the proper temperature before begin- 
ning. This can be accomplished in cold weather by stand- 
ing the crock in a large pan, pouring boiling water around it, 
and letting it stand until ready. The use of hot water later 
in the churn togather the butter, tends to render it white and 
tasteless. 

The above directions are for the crank or " Rose " churn, 
which is recommended, instead of the old-fashioned churn, as 
being far less fatiguing. 

BONNY CLABBER. 

Fill a glass dish with whole or skimmed milk that is 24 
hours old. Set it in a rather warm place, that is, not on the 
ice (from 75° to 80°), and let it stand until the milk becomes 
perfectly firm. Then set in the ice-box until very cold, and 
serve before it gets to the point of "cracking," that is, the 
point where the curd and whey separate. The time for 
this cannot be specified definitely, as it depends upon the 
weather and atmosphere, a warm day or a thunder-storm 
serving to lobber the milk more rapidly. Serve very cold 
with cream, sugar, and grated nutmeg to taste. 

COTTAGE CHEESE OR SCHMIER-KASE. 

The milk for this purpose may be skimmed or whole. Let 
it stand off the ice in a bowl or pan until it forms by itself z. 
firm curd. This will take from 24 to 48 hours (or even more) 
according to the weather. If this latter is cool, the milk may 
be placed in a warm corner of the kitchen ; but on no account 
set it on the range, as is so often done, to the great detriment 
of the cheese. When it has formed a firm curd, and begins 
to " crack," as above described, pour it into a coarse muslin 
or cheese-cloth bag. Tie the top together with a strong 



372 GOOD-LIVING. 

twine and suspend the bag (if in the country) from the limb 
of a tree, in the shade. Place a pan underneath to catch 
the whey; let it hang until the whey ceases to drip — no 
longer. Take a portion of the cheese ; rub it up with a gen- 
erous lump of fresh butter, a little salt, and sufficient thick, 
sweet cream to make it soft. Serve very cold, with a pitcher 
of cream, and salt or sugar, according to taste. There are 
perforated tin-moulds made for draining this cheese, which 
are also very good. The cufds should be left in the mould 
until all the whey is drained off, and may then be turned out 
in shape. Mix with cream only as much of the cheese as 
will be used at one time, leaving the remainder on the ice ; 
otherwise the cream might become sour and spoil the sweet- 
ness of the cheese. 

N. B. — Observe particularly that the milk must not be 
scalded to form the curd, or the cheese will be first leathery, 
then dry and grainy ; in short, not a success.

YJSAST. 

4 large potatoes, i cup of good yeast, 

I gill of sugar, I quart of boiling water, 

2 tablespoons of salt. 

Peel, the potatoes ; let them lie in. cold water 30 minutes. 
Have ready the boiling water in a saucepan. Grate the 
potatoes quickly ; stir them in the boiling water over the 
fire for 5 minutes. Remove, and add the sugar and salt. 
Turn into a bowl and set aside until lukewarm ; then add 
the yeast ; cover and ferment 3 or 4 hours. Every time it 
rises to the top of the bowl, stir it down. Bottle it ; cork 
tightly and set in a cool, but not freezing place. It will keep 
for 2 weeks. Save i cupful to start with next time.

374 GOOD-LIVING. 

Set in a sheltered corner ; cover with a cloth. Next morn- 
ing knead well once for 15 nninutes, adding only enough 
flour to keep from sticking to your fingers. Mould into 
loaves and put into greased pans. The pans should not be 
more than ^full. Set again in a sheltered corner and 
cover. In I or 2 hours, when it is raised to at least twice 
its bulk, bake for about 45 minutes (for medium-sized loaves), 
turning the loaves, when firmly set, so that all sides may 
brown alike. Avoid letting any draught blow on the dough 
while raising, shutting any window that may be near. It 
must be kept in a moderately-warm, even temperature. The 
oven must be not too quick, and .very steady. The above 
receipt, if followed literally, will be found excellent. 

N. B. — If milk is used with the warm water, watch that 
it does not become sour in warm weather. It is a good plan, 
in this case, to mix about |^ of a teaspoonful of soda with 
a few drops of boiling water, and, when lukewarm, to work 
it into the dough while kneading. For raising, the temper- 
ature should be from 90° to 95". 

BRAN BREAD. 

To the receipt for Bread, add, when kneading, i gill of 
strained molasses and 2 handfuls of clean bran. Omit the 
sugar, and raise very light. Finish as abpve. 

RYE BREAD. 

Make the wheat-sponge as directed in receipt for Bread. 
Set it overnight. The next morning, work in just enough 
rye-meal to prevent the dough from sticking to the hands. 
Knead it well, and finish according to the same receipt. 
Rye bread is never as light as wheat, but is wholesome as a 
variety. This is the kind of bread that should be cut very 
thin, buttered, and put together in tartines, to be served 
with whitebait or with raw oysters. This last is a European 
custom which we may adopt with advantage. 



BREAD ROLLS. 375 

GRAHAM BREAD. 

Mix a wheat-sponge as directed in receipt for Bread. Set 
it overnight. Next morning, work in 4 tablespoonfuls of 
molasses and sufficient Graham flour to make a dough a 
little softer than wheat bread. As Graham bread sours very 
easily, it is best to set the sponge without milk ; watch it 
carefully when formed into loaves and set to rise, and just 
as soon as it is light, put it into the oven. Finish as directed. 

GLUTEN BREAD. 

I cake of Flerechman's yeast, I quart of lukewarm water, 

% tablespoon of salt. Gluten-flour, for stiff dough, about 2 pounds. 

Melt the .yeast thoroughly in the warm water ; add salt. 
Work in the flour by degrees. Set in a warm, sheltered 
corner. Cover. When raised to at least twice its bulk, 
knead the dough very thoroughly for 10 to 15 minutes. 
Mould the loaves not larger than \ the size of the pans. 
Put into greased pans and raise as before, ^ake in a steady, 
moderately-hot oven. When the loaves are firm, say in 
about 20 minutes, turn and brown them evenly on all sides. 
They will be done in about 45 minutes, according to the , 
oven. 

BREAD ROLLS. 

Having made wheat Bread according to receipt, take a 
piece of dough the size of an ordinary loaf ; knead it about 
twice as long as directed for the bread ; form it into even, 
small balls and place in greased gem-pans. Cover and set in 
a warm corner until risen very light, a little more than twice 
their original bulk, then bake in a moderately-quick oven for 
about 20 to 25 minutes. Watch and turn them that they 
may brown evenly. 

Or, having rolled the dough as directed above, place the 
balls side by side in a pie-tin ; raise very light, as directed ; 
bake, and serve without breaking apart. They should be 
eaten hot ; and broken, not cut with a knife. This makes a 
very pretty loaf.

BREAD PUFFS. 

Take the value of i loaf of risen bread-dough. When 
very light, have ready boiling some deep lard in a kettle. 
Pull out some of the dough quite thin ; cut it in 2-inch 
lengths. Throw them immediately into the boiling lard 
and cook until puffed and golden-brown, like doughnuts. 
Remove with a skimmer ; drain, and serve hot. They may 
be covered with powdered cinnamon and sugar as they are 
removed from the fire, and should be eaten immediately 
with butter. Very simple and good. 

ITALIAN BREAD. 

I pound of bread-dough, 4 ounces of softened butter, 

Corn-meal. 

Work the butter into the dough, when it has risen ready 
for the oven. Roll it out \ an inch thick ; cut it into strips 
nearly i inch wide by 7 or 8 inches long. Sift fine corn- 
meal over them ; place on a sheet of greased tin, not 
touching each other, and when light (about i hour) bake in 
a quick oven about 10 minutes.

Add to the water enough flour to make a thick batter ; 
add ^ teaspoonful of salt, and beat until smooth and full of 
air-bubbles. Cover closely. Stand the pitcher in a pan of 
warm water, and set in a warm place from 5 to 8 hours. It 
requires to be kept much warmer than bread which is made 
with yeast, in a temperature of about 1 12 degrees, and may be 
stirred once or twice while rising. In the morning, scald the 
milk, and set aside to cool. When lukewarm, add I tea- 
spoon of salt and enough flour to make a batter thick enough 
to drop, not pour, from the spoon. Now turn into this the 
salt-rising, which should be very light, and have an unpleasant 
odor. Beat vigorously and continuously for 3 minutes. Cover

in a warm place until very light, about 2 hours ; then add 
sufficient flour to make a dough that will not stick to the 
hands. Knead thoroughly until smooth and elastic. Mould 
into loaves ; place in greased pans ; cover with a cloth, and, 
when very light, bake in a moderate oven i hour. This must 
be kept warmer than yeast bread, or it will not rise. The 
above receipt is given to be used when yeast is not obtainable.

to the sour milk ; mix, and pour into the meal ; add the 
salt, and stir well together. Pour it into a well-greased, 
2-quart brown-bread mould ; put on the lid and steam for 5

When lukewarm, add yeast, salt, sugar, and flour. Beat 
steadily for 5 minutes. Cover. Set in a warm place for 2 
hours, to rise, until very light. In winter it will require a 
longer time. Beat the yolks and whites of eggs, apart, until 
very light ; add first the yolks to the batter, then the whites. 
Stir lightly and carefully. Set again in a warm place for 1 5

ANGEL CAKE. 395 

Set in a quick, but not scorching, oven. Shut the door very 
gently, and be careful not to jar the cake, or it will be heavy. 
Do not open the door for about lo minutes, and then as 
little as possible, and very gently. If the cake is baking 
quicker one side than the other, turn it around very care- 
fully, but not until the cake has begun to set.' If the top 
browns too quickly, cover with a layer of thick paper. If it 
cracks ever so little, lessen the heat of the oven by opening 
the range-cover above it on a crack about | of an inch wide. 
A cracked loaf-cake is never a light cake. Great care must 
be taken in the baking, for as much of the success depends 
upon that as upon the ingredients and the manner of com- 
bining them. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. .Test through the 
middle with a broom-whisp. If it comes out perfectly dry, 
the cake is done. Turn it out on an inverted sieve to cool. 
Ice it, or simply sift powdered sugar over it.

add the juice and rind of lemon and J of the flour. Mix 
well. Now add J the whites of eggs ; mix carefully and 
quickly ; then the second ^, and mix ; then the remaining 
whites of eggs. Stir as little as is necessary to mix in the 
whites ; pour into i or more pans, and bake in a quick oven 
30 to 45 minutes, according to size. If the top is inclined

a plate, with the under-side uppermost. Spread over this a 
layer of Ice-Cream Filling (see receipt). Over this spread a 
thick layer of grated cocoa-nut ; then the second layer of cake, 
with the top uppermost. Spread this also with Ice-Cream 
Filling, made a little stiffer with sugar ; or use Egg-Icing. 
Pack the top all over with grated cocoa-nut, covering sides 
and all, so that nothing shows but the white of the cocoa-nut. 
Set away for 2 hours ; transfer very carefully to a plate, on 
which is a fancy-cut paper, and serve. Recommended. 

Or, use Cocoa-nut Filling (see receipt). 



PHILADELPHIA WHITE MOUNTAIN CAKE. 403 

COCOA-NUT LA YER CAKE NO. II. 

Proceed exactly as for Cocoa-nut Layer Cake No. I., 
spreading first a moderately-thick coating of very good 
currant-jelly upon the cake, then the filling and cocoa-nut as 
described. Finish as directed. Recommended. Or use 
Cocoa-nut Filling (see receipt). 

PHILADELPHIA WHITE MOUNTAIN CAKE. 

II ounces of powdered sugar, % pound of flour, 

3 heaping teaspoons of baking-powder, 5 eggs. 

Juice and rind of i lemon, i gill of sherry, 

^ teaspoon of ground mace, 2 gills of milk, , 

3 ounces of corn-starch, 6 ounces of butter, 
I teaspoon of vanilla. 

Beat the butter and sugar to a cream ; add the yolks 
of eggs, and beat as light as possible. Add vanilla, lemon, 
and mace. Beat the whites of eggs to a very stiff froth ; add 
them gradually and alternately with the milk to the batter. 
Sift the corn-starch and baking-powder together, and add 
them gradually to the mixture, beating quickly all the time ; 
then pour into 3 large jelly-cake tins and bake in a quick 
oven about 10 to 12 minutes. Test with a broom-whisp ; if 
it comes out dry, the cake is done. Turn the layers out on 
a board ; then turn them back again to bring the upper-side 
on top. 

N. B. — If you use Royal baking-powder, 2 heaping tea- 
spoonfuls will suffice; of Cleveland's, use the quantity 
named. 

FILLING FOR SAME. 

Whites of 2 eggs, yi pound of powdered sugar, 

I gill of boiling water, i teaspoon of vanilla. 

Boil the sugar and water together until it forms a thread 
when dropped from the spoon. The whites of eggs must be 
beaten, meanwhile, as stiff as possible. Put them into a 
small bowl (a i-quart bowl will do), and, when the -syrup 
has reached the proper point, take it off instantly and beat 
the syrup into the whites of eggs with a Dover egg-beater. 



404 GOOD.UVING. 

adding the former by degrees. Continue to beat steadily 
until perfectly cold. This point may be attained more 
quickly by standing the bowl near an open window, or by 
setting it in a pan with a small piece of ice ; but beat contin- 
ually. In testing this receipt, it is found that the amount of 
filling given makes only enough for 2 layers of medium size. 
It is therefore recommended to use the same proportions, 
that is : i white of . egg, \ a gill of water, and \ pound of 
powdered sugar for each additional layer. The filling should 
be very thick between the layers of cake; at least \ an 
inch thick. If the sugar has been boiled to the exact degree 
(wherein lies the one difficulty of making it in perfection) 
the filling will be as smooth and mellow as whipped cream 
and stiff enough to hold itself in shape like thick meringue. 
Spread the filling between the layers of cake, and finish the 
top with a little sifted, powdered sugar. Dexter, of Phila- 
delphia, is famous for the above cake. The Secret of the 
perfection of his manufacture is not divulged, but this is a 
very good imitation.

y^ pound of sugar, Whipped cream, ) ^^ ^^^^^ ^.^ 

I gill of strong coffee. Coffee, ) 

Put the butter in a saucepan on the fire with 6 tablespoons 
of boiling water. When beginning to boil, add the flour 
(about the quantity indicated, perhaps a pinch more). Stir 
with a wooden spoon 3 minutes, or until it leaves the sides 
of the saucepan and is very stiff. Remove, and add, i at- 
a time, the eggs, stirring each in very thoroughly. Have 
ready, slightly greased, an 6clair-pan (they can be had made 
of sheet-iron, and are very good). Set in a quick oven for 
about I S minutes. Watch very carefully, as, if the oven is 
too hot, they may scorch. They must not brown. When 
done, make an incision in the side of each and fill with 
sweetened, whipped cream flavored with coffee, or with 
Coffee Filling (see receipt). 

Icing : Put into a china-lined saucepan the sugar and i gill 
of very strong, good coffee ; a mixture of Mocha and Java is 
best. ' Boil it until it makes a thread when dropped from the 
spoon. Drop a little into a cup of cold water ; take it be- 
tween thumb and finger, and, if it makes a fine thread with- 
out breaking, it is ready. Remove from the fire and stir 
until it begins to thicken slightly ; then coat each dclair 
with it.

Whites of 4 eggs, 9 ounces of granulated sugar. 

Beat the eggs to a stiff froth, then stir the sugar in very 
gently. Have ready a board about i inch thick, which will 
fit in your oven. Cover the board with white paper. With 
a tablespoon, put upon this the mixture in any shape you 
fancy ; the shape of a large half-egg is the best. Set the 
board in a slow oven, and bake slowly ; on this depends a 
great part bf the success of making good kisses. They 
should be at least i hour in the oven, and should become 
quite hard to the touch, without being more than a pale, 
light brown. If they show signs of browning too much or too 
soon, cover with thick paper. When done, detach them 
from the paper with a knife, and put them together in pairs. 
Or, they may be baked in sections about 4 inches long, and, 
when done, the flat sides may be slightly excavated, filled 
with ice-cream, then joined together, and served as MMngues

plate on which is a fancy-cut paper, and serve. Recom- 
mended. 

ORANGE LAYER CAKE. 

Make 4 layers of Layer Cake No. II. (see receipt), grating 
into the batter the rind of i orange. Prepare a Custard 



SMALL POUND-CAKES. 409 

Filling (see receipt) flavored with the rind of I and juice of 
2 oranges. When cold, place this between the layers of 
cake. Make an icing of the strained juice of i orange, into 
which beat powdered sugar until just thick enough to spread 
over the top of the cake. Let it stand half an hour, and 
add a second layer of icing, if liked. Decorate with glac6d 
oranges and cherries. Recommended. 

LA YER CAKE A U RHUM, OR KIRSCH. 

Prepare 2 layers of Layer Cake No. IL Lay i layer on a 
plate with the upper-side down. Spread it thickly with rasp- 
berry-and-currant jelly or with cider jelly (the jelly must be 
a little tart). Put the second layer over this. Make an icing 
of I gill of Jamaica rum or kirsch, with powdered sugar 
beaten into it until just thick enough to spread. Cover with 
this and set away. After \ an hour, a second layer of icing 
may be added if liked. Recommended. , 

WALNUT CAKE. 

Mak^ 2 layers of Layer Cake No. IL Lay i layer on a plate 
with the upper-side down ; spread it with a thick coating of 
Ice-Cream Filling (see receipt). Upon this place shelled and 
skinned walnuts. Cover with a second layer of cake. Spread 
with a second layer of filling, and sprinkle all over the top, 
very neatly, the nuts prepared in the same way. . 

HAZEL-NUT CAKE. 

Proceed as for Walnut Cake, substituting hazel-nuts shelled, 
skiftned, and split. 

SMALL POUND-CAKES. 

3 eggs. Their weight in butter, 

Their weight in sugar, Juice and grated rind of ^ a lemon, 

" " "flour, I ounce of Preserved Lemon Peel (see receipt). 

Cream the butter and sugar, beating thoroughly (this may 
be done with the hand). Add the yolks of eggs and beat

until very light. Beat the whites to a dry froth and add 
them and the flour alternately. Add the lemon-juice and 
rind and the preserved peel cut into small bits. Beat hard 
for several minutes until very light. Have ready well-greased 
gem or patty-pans. Fill them f-full of the mixture and bake 
in a moderately-quick oven 15 to 20 minutes. Test with a 
broom-whisp. Set on an inverted sieve to cool. Ice the top 
with Lemon Icing, if liked. 



PROMISES. 

I pound of sifted flour, 1 egg, 

6 ounces of sugar, J^ pound of butter, 

]i cup of rum or sherry. 

Mix together the egg, sugar, and butter, then add the 
flour; mix evenly; then a^d the rum or sherry. When 
mixed to an even dough, about as stiff as soft putty, lay a 
lump of it in a large baking-pan, and, with the hand, press it 
out as thin as possible, not more than I- to ^ of an inch thick. 
This is a little tedious, but rolling does not accomplish at all 
the same results. If you keep a plate of flour near by, and 
dip your hand into it now and again, it will be eeisier. It is 
worth the trouble, being a most delicious cake, and not at all 
common. When the bottom of the pan is covered, sift over 
the dough some powdered sugar mixed with a little pinch of 
.ground cinnamon. Bake in a moderately-quick oven until 
the edges are quite brown and the rest pale yellow, like deli- 
cate pie-crust. Remove it fromi the oven. Take immediately 
a sharp knife and cut through the cake the length of the pan, 
then cut it across in strips about i inch wide. Take these 
out carefully, as they break easily, and lay .on a platter. 
They will harden as they get cold. As the above' quantity 
makes a large number of cakes, it will be much quicker to 
have several pans in use at a time. Dish the cakes on 
cut paper in a pile, placing layers of 4 at right angles. Serve 
with tea or coffee. Highly recommended.

VtTEMENT FAIT. 

2 eggs, Flour, 

Finch of salt, Butter, 

Sugar. 

To the egg and salt, add enough flour to make a dough 
just sufficiently stiff to roll out as thin as a chamois-skin. 
Lay this upon shallow tins. Put small lumps of butter over 
the top ; sift sugar over all, and bake in a quick oven about 
3 to 5 minutes, or until very slightly browned. Powdered 
cinnamon may be added to the sugar according to taste. 
When removed from the oven, and still hot, cut or break 
into more or less even pieces. As it cools, it will become per- 
fectly firm and crisp.

add the flour. Dust the bread-board with granulated sugar ; 
roll out the mixture ^ of an inch thi.ck ; cut with a round cut- 
ter ; take the centre out with the top of the pepper-caster ; 
bake these rings in a moderate oven until the edges brown 
slightly. Or, when done, draw the pan to the mouth of the 
oven ; brush over the cajce with white of egg and sift with very 
coarse sugar. If this is done, the cakes should be rolled out 
on a floured board.

rounds and bake in a quick oven 3 to 5 minutes. Do not 
bake too long, as all ginger snaps easily acquire a burned 
taste if very much browned. Watch closely, as they scorch 
easily. The above ginger snaps are recommended, being 
very delicate, brittle, and at the same time rich. 

NOBBY BUNS. 

2 pounds of sifted flour, i pound of butter, 

4 teaspoons of ground cinnamon, 6 eggs, 

I % pounds of sugar.

butter and sugar ; add a little of the milk and mix. Now 
add the yolks of eggs and beat well ; then add alternately 
milk, beaten whites of eggs, and flour. Grease flat tins; 
drop the batter on them in separate spoonfuls. Have the 
currants cleaned (see receipt To Clean Currants) and sprinkle 
a few over the top of each cake. Set in a quick oven and 
bake a rich brown. The cakes will run together, but must 
be broken apart when taken from the oven. Cool them' on 
a sieve. The batter for this cake is said to keep i week in 
a cool place.

shells ; fill J-fuU of the mixture and bake in a quick oven 
for about 10 minutes. Watch carefully and brown evenly. 
Test with a broom-whisp. When it comes out perfectly 
dry, the cakes are done. Serve as soon as they are cool. If 
kept until next day, they must be shut in an air-tight tin or 
stood in the ice-box ; but they should be eaten fresh, and 
will be found most excellent. This receipt will make about 
24 small cakes.

to roll out \ an inch thick; do not add any more than 
what will enable you to handle it. Cut the paste into nar- 
row strips ; tie the strips in bows, or loops, or any shape 
your fancy may suggest. Have ready on the fire a deep 
saucepan or kettle with at least 3 inches of melted lard. It 
should be deep enough to float the crullers, so that they 
may have space to swell without touching the bottom. 
Bring it gradually to a boil. Test it (see General Direc- 
tions for Frying). When certain that it does boil, pro- 
ceed to fry the crullers. Have at hand a clean skimmer, 
a large sheet of brown paper on a tin in the open mouth 
of the oven, and the sugar. When every thing is ready, 
take a plateful at a time of the crullers ; drop them 
carefully into the lard. Watch them, and turn them over 
with the skimmer until golden-brown on all sides ; then 
drain them out with the skimmer and lay on the brown 
paper; as soon as dry, transfer to a platter and powder 
generously with sugar. Do not let them brown too much 
in the cooking. If not too stiff with flour, these will be 
found very light, crisp, and most excellent.

Bring the sugar, water, and lemon, juice and rind, to a 
boil. Blend the corn-starch with a few drops of cold water. 
Stir it into the boiling water and stir while it boils 2 or 3 
minutes. Beat the eggs in a bowl, and when the water and 
lemon are boiling, stir them gradually into the eggs, stirring 
briskly. If not quite thick enough, set over boiling water, 
and stir for a few minutes until the eggs set a little. Do 
not let it boil, or it will curdle. Do not let it thicken too 
much, as it stiffens when cold. 

ORANGE-CUSTARD FILLING. 

Proceed exactly as for Lemon-Custard Filling, substituting 
I orange for the lemon. 

ALMOND-PASTE FILLING. 

yi pound of sweet almonds, Sifted powdered sugar, 

I ounce of bitter almonds. White of I egg. 

Rose-water to taste. 

Blanch the almonds and pound to a pjiste in a mortar, 
adding' now and again a few drops of rose-water to ayoid 
oiling. Mix with an equal weight of sugar. Moisten with 
the white of egg ; allow it to dry slightly, and then spread 
on thin layers of cake cut into neat shapes ; or use as filling 
for Archangel Cake, etc.

upon the eggs, stirring briskly. If not quite thick enough, 
set over boiling water on the fire, and stir until the egg sets 
a little. Do not boil, or it will curdle. Pour this over the 
layer of cake, placing another layer on top, and so on. Fin- 
ish the top with Coffee Icing (see receipt). The custard 
must not be too thick, as it will harden in cooling. 

CUSTARD FILLING. 

Proceed exactly as above, substituting milk for coffee, 
and using any flavoring that may be preferred. 

ICE-CREAM FILLING. 

2 whites of eggs, 4 tablespoons of powdered sugar. 

Flavoring. 

Be^t the whites until only foamy, then beat in the sugar 
by degrees and beat until smooth, stiff, and glossy. It 
shpuld be as stiff as meringue, not as stiff as icing. The 
same may be used for the top of the cake also. 

LEMON ICING, 

Squeeze and strain the juice of a lemon ; stir into it, by 
degrees, enough sugar to enable you to spread the icing. 
Having covered the top of the cake, set away for i or 2 
hours in a cool place. If a deeper icing is required, after 
the cake has stood for a few minutes, add a second layer. 
Recommended. 

RUM, BRANDY, KIRSCH ICING. 

For a moderate-sized cake, take about i gill of either of 
the above ; beat in powdered sugar until thick . enough to 
spread. Cover the cake. Set away for i or 2 hours in a 
cool place. If a thicker icing is wanted, after \ an hour spread 
a second layer over the first. Recommended. 

COFFEE ICING. 

Take a gill of very strong, well cleared and strained coffee ; 
stir into it powdered sugar until thick enough to spread.

Cover the cake and set away for i or 2 hours in a cool place. 
If a thicker icing is wanted, add a second layer. Recom- 
mended. 

ORANGE ICING. 
See Lemon and other icings. 

EGG ICING. 

I pound of sugar, Whites of 3 eggs, 

Flavoring. 

Beat the whites only imtil frothy, not stiff, or the icing 
will take longer to dry. Add the sugar gradually, beating 
all the while. Flavor to taste with lemon, orange, vanilla, 
etc., adding, however, very little liquid, or more sugar will 
be required. When stiff enough, dip a knife in cold water 
and smooth the icing over the cake. This is sufficient to 
cover a good-sized cake. 

CREAM ICING. 

I pound of powdered sugar, i gill of boiling water, 

Whites of 3 eggs. 

Boil the sugar and water for 6 minutes, or until it makes a 
thread when poured from the spoon. While the sugar boils, 
beat the eggs to a stiff froth. Put them into a bowl, and 
when the syrup reaches the desired point, pour it in a fine 
stream upon the eggs while you beat with a Dover egg- 
beater. When thick enough to spread, dip a knife in cold 
water and smooth the icing over the cake. It will have to 
be beaten until almost, if not quite, cold. 

WINE ICING. 

For a moderate-sized cake, take i gill of wine ; stir into it 
enough powdered sugar to make it thick enough to spread ; 
smooth it over the cake and set it away for an hour or more 
in a cool, dry place. If a thicker icing is required, add a 
second layer. This system is strongly recommended, as 
being very simple and a great saving of time. See Lemon 
Icing, etc. 



PASTRY, PIES, AND PUDDINGS. 

PUFF-PASTE. 
pAte feuillet^e. 

I pound of dry sifted flour, i pound of freshest butter, 

I egg. Ice-water, about I gill. 

As the manipulation o{ puff-paste is the most important 
point in its manufacture, it is rather difficult to reach success 
through a recipe alone ; if yoUy cannot see it made once by a 
first-class hand, you will have to gain your own experience 
by patient practice. A receipt can, after all, only give a 
certain amount of assistance towards success : in this case 
much depends upon the cook. First of all, the flour must 
be dry and of the best quality ; the butter should be washed 
and set away until as cold and firm as ice ; ice-water should 
be used in the mixing ; it should be made in as cool a place 
as possible, and rolled on a marble slab. When all is ready, 
cut the butter in 4 equal parts. Put the flour in a mound in 
a bowl ; make a hole in the centre, break in the egg and 
work it in, handling very little and lightly. Add just enough 
ice-water to make the paste soft enough to roll out. Flour 
the board and pin with a little extra flour, and roll out the 
paste quite thin. Take \ of the butter, break it up in 
bits ; dot these over the surface of the paste ; dredge them 
very lightly with a little extra flour, and fold the paste over 
from the sides to the centre, then in 3. Turn ^way round 
and roll this again until quite thin ; add the second \ of 
butter broken in bits as before ; dredge with flour ; fold as 
before and roll always in the same direction — from you ; 

423 



424 GOOD.LIVING. 

dredge again. Repeat this process, turning ^way each 
time, until all the butter is in. After the last rolling, fold it 
again and cut it with a floured knife into 3 parts. Lay 
these on plat.es and set in the ice-box for an hour or more, 
until perfectly firm. It is now ready for use. For pies, it 
should be rolled out about \ of an inch thick for the top ; the 
edges should have i or 2 extra layers of paste. It is best to 
make the under-crust of Flaky Crust or Good Plain Paste 
rolled thin, and keep the pufl-paste for the upper crust and 
edges, where it can rise better. This paste does for vol-au- 
vents, small pat^s, etc., etc. For these latter, it is advisable, 
when the empty shell is baked, to draw it to the mouth 
of the oven, brush the top over with beaten egg, and set it 
back for i minute or 2 to trown. The oven should always 
be very hot and very even for baking puff, or indeed any, 
paste. Do not set the pie-plate too near the inner, or fire, 
side of the oven, or it will bake unevenly, one side rising 
higher than the other. 

The raw paste may be kept for 24 hours in the ice-box ; 
but once baked, it must not be placed near the ice, or it will 
become tough beyond correction. 

N. B. — The egg may be omitted if desired, but is consid- 
ered a good addition. 

FLAKY PIE-CRUST. 

I pound of sifted flour, 9 ounces of butter, 

7 ounces of good firm lard, % teaspoon of salt, 

2 gills of ice-water. 

This quantity will make 3 pies of ordinary size. Rub the 
butter and flour lightly but firmly together, being careful to 
keep the flour always beitween the lard and the hand. Add 
the water, mixing with a knife. Place the paste on a floured 
board, using a very little extra flour ; roll it into a thin 
sheet ; dot it all over with \ of the butter ; dredge a little 
extra flour over it, and, with the hands touching as little as 
possible, roll it up like a sheet of music. Divide it in 2. 
Divide one of the halves into 3 parts for the bottom crust ; 



POTATO PASTRY. 425 

roll these out, and cover the pie-plates. Now roll the 
remaining paste into a thin sheet. Dot it over with, ^ the 
remaining butter ; sift a little flour over it ; lap the 4 corners 
toward the centre ; roll again thin ; dot with the remaining 
butter ; dredge with flour ; fold as before, but do not roll out 
quite as thin. Roll into a thick scroll. To cover each 
pie, cut ^ of the scroll, flour both ends, and roll it on the end 
quite thin. Put 3 thin layers for i cover, instead of i 
thick layer, notching the edges together .and trimming neatly. 
N. B. — Always roll in the same direction — from you. 
Bake in a quick oven.

yi pound of lard, 2 gills of ice-water, 

5 ounces of flour for board and pin. Pinch of salt. 

Sift the flour into a 2-quart bowl. Cut the butter and lard 
(well iced) through it with a knife into bits about the size of 
a cherry. Sprinkle the water over all, and mix with a knife, 
using as few strokes as possible. Flour a space on the board 
about 24X 18 inches. Turn out the dough in the centre of 
the space. Flour the pin, and roll the dough until nearly 
large enough to cover the floured space. Now sift a very 
thin coating of flour over the whole sheet ; fold it in 3, 
lengthwise and across, making a piece about 8x6 inches. 
Flour the board again. Roll out again ; sift with flour, and 
fold as before ; roll a third time ; sift again ; now roll it like 
a sheet of music. Cut it across the centre ; lay it on a plate 
in the ice-box for 15 minutes or longer; then it may be used. 

POTATO PASTRY. 

j( pound of sifted flour, % pound of mashed potato, 

3 ounces of butter. Pinch of salt, 

Ice-water. 

Press the potatoes through a colander. Addflour, butter, 
salt, and mix. Add enough water for stiff paste. Roll out. 
Use for plain meat-pies, etc.

SUET PASTE. 

I pound of sifted flour, 6 ounces of beef-suet, 

I teaspoon of salt, i cup of ice-water. 

Remove the fibres from the suet, and chop it very fine. 
Rub in the flour and salt with the hands. Then add 
enough water to make a soft dough. Roll out. ' Use for 
meat-pies and apple-dumplings. 

MINCE-PIE NO. I. 

1 fresh tongue, boiled and minced very i pound of brown sugar, 

fine, I cup of New Orleans molasses, 

3 pounds of suet, well picked over, and i heaping tablespoon of ground cin- 

laid in cold water, namon, 

4 pounds of raisins, stoned, not chopped, yi, heaping tablespoon of ground cloves, 
4 " " currants, cleaned (see re- i " " " " allspice, 

ceipt), I nutmeg, grated, 

2 pounds of citron, sliced, i pint of cider, 

2 quarts of brandy. 

Stir all but the brandy together ; put it in a crock without 
the brandy, and leave it for i hour in a slow oven. Stir oc- 
casionally. Then remove the crock from the oven ; stir in 
brandy enough to make the mixture very soft. Cover 
closely, and set away. Allow at least i month, or if pos- 
sible 6 weeks, for it to mature, adding a little brandy from 
time to time, if it dries out at all. Add spice or sugar to 
taste, as may be required. To make up the pies, add 4 
apples, peeled and chopped, to about i quart of the mince- 
meat. These pies have quite a peculiar charm about them, 
the secret being that the excellent housekeeper who makes 
them always adds, at the last, some preserved strawberries and 
candied cherries, with sufficient fresh brandy to make the 
mince-meat very soft. They have a mellowness of flavor 
seldom met with in the mince-pies of modern times. The 
pies should be made up with the very best Puff-Paste, or 
with Flaky Pie-Crust. The under-crust should be very thin, 
the edges built up with i or 2 extra layers, notched together 
and trimmed neatly. Bake only until just done, allowing for

boiling water ; beat the eggs together in a bowl ; beat the 
sugar and the flavoring with them. When the milk boils, 
pour it upon the eggs very gently, and stir until the sugar is 
dissolved and well-mixed. Pour this into the crust ; if the 
edge is not high enough, add another layer and notch it 
neatly, wetting it slightly to make it stick. The custard 
should be fully i inch deep. Bake in a moderately-quick 
oven until the custard sets, which will be from 15 to 20 
minutes. If you do not wish to use so many eggs, thicken

4 eggs, yolks only, 
Vanilla or rum.

hours, till it becomes thoroughly cold. Soak the gelatine in 
the cold water for 2 hours. Put I pint of cream in the 
farina-kettle and bring it to a boil with the sugar. When it 
comes to a boil, pour it over the gelatine. Stir until the 
gelatine is dissolved, returning the cream to the fire if neces- 
sary. Set aside to cool. Beat the yolks of eggs to a cream. 
When the cream is cool enough, stir in the eggs briskly ; 
when well mixed, strain into a bowl ; add vanilla or rum to 
taste and set away on the ice. Now take the other pint of 
cream which has been on the ice all this time ; set it in a 
bowl in a pan of cracked ice, and, with a Dover egg-beater, 
whip it to a stiff froth, skimming the froth, as it rises, into a 
second cold bowl. (N. B. — Keep all very cold, and you will 
save both time and trouble.) When the boiled cream is quite 
cold and has begun to thicken, stir it over ice until perfectly 
smooth ; then stir into it the whipped cream with as few 
strokes as possible to mix well. Rinse 2 moulds, or i large 
one, with cold water. Fill with the mixture and set away to 
harden. When firm, turn it out and serve with or without 
a pitcher of cream, or with Whipped-Cream Sauce (see re- 
ceipt). This is not at all difficult to make, though a little 
tedious. Delicious.

When well mixed, strain it into a clean farina-kettle and set it 
over boiling water on the fire ; stir until the custard thickens 
a little. Do not let it boil, or it will curdle. While hot, 
pour it over the gelatine which has been soaking for about 
2 hours in cold water. Stir until dissolved. Strain it into 
a bowl and put it on the ice. When beginning to set, have 
the cream ready whipped ; stir the coffee over ice, and finish 
as directed for Bavarian Cream (see receipt). 

ORANGE BA VARIAN CREAM. 

BAVAROISE A L'ORANGE. 

j^ box Cox's gelatine, i cup of white sugar, 

I pint of cream, i pint of new milk, 

5 oranges, 5 e^s, yolks only. 

Put the cream on the ice for hours before using, and get it 
thoroughly cold. 

Cover the gelatine with cold water. Soak it i to 2 hours. 
Bring the milk to a boil. When boiling, throw it over the 
gelatine and stir until dissolved. Beat the yolks and sugar 
to a cream, then stir the gelatine and milk into them. Stir 
it over the fire in a clean saucepan for 2 minutes ; then 
strain it into a bowl and set away to cool. It must not boil, 
or it will curdle. When cold, stir in the strained juice of the 
oranges. Whip the cream as directed for Bavarian Cream 
(see receipt). When the custard is very cold and beginning 
to set, stir it over ice until perfectly smooth and thick ; add 
the whipped cream and finish as directed. Serve with plain 
or whipped cream. 

SNOW CREAM. 

NEIGE. 

4 whites of eggs, i teaspoon of vanilla, 

I pint of cream, whipped, 4 tablespoons of powdered sugar, 

I tablespoon of sherry. 

Beat the whites until foamy; add the sifted sugar by 
degrees, beating steadily ; then beat until stiff and glossy. 



CHARLOTTE RUSSE NO I. 457 

Add sherry and vanilla. Whip the cream (which has been 
on the ice for hours) to a stiff froth, over a pan of ice. Stir 
it carefully into the meringue. ' Serve in small custard 
glasses, very cold. You may add to the above a few sweet 
almonds, blanched and chopped very fine. Very simple for 
summer dessert. 

WHIPPED CREAM. 
CR^ME FOUETT^E. 

The secret of whipping cream easily is, first of all, to have 
good cream, and then to set it on the ice for several hours 
before it is required. When that time arrives, sweeten the 
cream to taste ; add a few drops of Jamaica rum ; set the 
bowl in a pan of cracked ice. Have beside you a second 
bowl; beat the cream with a Dover egg-beater. As the 
froth rises, remove it to the second bowl. If the whip 
is required to be very stiff indeed, remove the froth to a 
sieve, and, as the unbeaten cream drains from it, that can be 
returned to the bowl and beaten again. 

If the cream itself is not very thick, and you are in doubt 
about it, dissolve \ of an ounce of gelatine in a very little cold 
milk for i hour, then place the cup in boiling water on the fire, 
and stir until the gelatine dissolves. When this is cold, but 
not set, it can be whipped into the cream prepared as above. 
In this way the whip will be quite firm after setting it on the 
ice for i or 2 hours.

the whites of eggs to a stiff froth, and add these to the 
cream. Rinse out moulds with cold water, and Ifne them 
with cake (see Charlotte Russe Cake, or Layer Sponge); 
fill them with the cream, and set away in a cold place until 
firm. The above may also be made with the whites of 6 eggs 
to the quart of cream. When stiff, turn it out on a cut paper, 
and serve.

vanilla. Rinse out a fancy mould with cold water ; pour the 
mixture into it. Set away on the ice until firm. When 
ready to serve, beat the whites of eggs to a foam ; add the 
powdered sugar gradually, and beat until stiff and glossy. 
Turn out the cream on a cut paper ; heap the meringue 
around it, and serve very cold. 

GELATINE PUDDING. 

4 eggs, I pint of milk, 

% box of Cox's gelatine, Sugar to taste, 

Vanilla, }( cup of boiling water (i^ gills). 

Bring the milk to a boil. Beat in a bowl the yolks of 
eggs with about 2 level tablespoonfuls of sugar. When the 
milk boils, stir it carefully into the eggs ; sweeten to taste. 
Put the eggs and milk into a saucepan over boiling water, 
and stir steadily until slightly thickened ; but do not boil, or 
the eggs will curdle. Set aside to cool. Meanwhile, soak 
the gelatine in about i gill of cold water for 2 hours ; pour 
over it the boiling water ; stir until dissolved ; strain and 
set aside until cold and just about to set. When the cus- 
tard, flavored to taste with vanilla, is cold, beat the whites 
of eggs and gelatine first separately, then together, to a stiff 
froth. Add these to the custard and beat well. Rinse out 
a mould with cold water ; pour in the mixture, and set away 
to harden. It will settle in 3 layers, making a dessert which 
is pleasing to both eye and palate. Turn out of the mould 
on a cut paper, and serve very cold. 

SNOW PUDDING. 

y^ box of Cox's gelatine. Juice of one lemon, 

1 cup of sugar, Slice of lemon-rind, 

2 whites of eggs, ^ pint of boiling water. 
^ pint of cold water, }4 " "wine. 

Put the gelatine to soak in the cold water for i hour with 
a piece of lemon-rind. Then pour over it the boiling water ; 
set it on the fire and stir until dissolved. Add the sugar, 
lemon-juice, and wine. When the sugar is all melted, 



462 GOOD-LIVING. 

strain the jelly into a bowl, and set away in a cool place. 
The liquid should mejisure i full pint. In summer, it is 
better to make it a little scant measure, as it does not 
stiffen as well. When the jelly is cool, beat the whites of 
eggs to a very stiff froth. Fill your quart mould with cold ' 
water, and let it stand while the pudding is being prepared. 
As soon as the jelly is set a little firm, beat it smooth with 
a Dover egg-beater ; then beat into it the whites of eggs. 
In summer it is best to stand the bowl in ice while you are 
beating. When all is beaten smoothly together, throw the 
cold water out of the mould ; fill it with the mixture, and 
set in a cold place to harden. When firm, turn it out and 
serve either with Whipped-Cream Sauce, or with a Custard 
Sauce, very cold. If you do not use wine, use the juice of 
2 lemons, and make up the necessary amount of liquid with 
boiling water. Excellent. 

COLD CABINET PUDDING. 

Prepare a cream blanc-mange or Velvet Cream (see re- 
ceipt). Before it is stiff, put a little into a mould which 
has been rinsed in cold water ; let it run all over to coat 
the surface thinly ; ornament it with candied cherries, 
etc. Fill the mould loosely with firm, preserved candied 
or brandied fruits, macaroons, stale sponge-cake soaked in 
wine, and a little citron sliced very thin. Then fill the 
mould slowly and carefully with the blanc-mange, which 
should be now as thick as batter ; stand . it on the ice for 
several hours, until perfectly firm ; then turn it out on a cut 
paper, and serve with cream. 

GELBE SPEISE. 

8 ounces of sugar, i pint of boiling water, 

2 " ", citron, sliced thin, i ounce of gelatine, 

I large lemon, juice and grated rind, 2 ounces of stoned raisins, 

5 whites of eggs, 9 yolks of eggs, 

I quart of cold water. 

Soak the gelatine for i hour in i quart of cold water. See 
that it is kept covered by the water. Beat the yolks of 



ORANGE JELLY JN BASKETS. 463 

eggs with the juice and grated rind of lemon and the sugar. 
Strain the gelatine from the water, and put it into a 
2-quart saucepan. Pour over this I pint of boiling water. 
Stir until dissolved. Pour ^ of this over the eggs and 
sugar ; stir briskly ; then stir this back into the pail con- 
taining the remaining half of the gelatine, stirring very 
quickly all the time. Set the pail over boiling water on the 
fire and stir until it becomes as thick as boiled custard. Do 
not boil, or it will curdle. Remove and set in a cold place 
until as thick as batter. Beat the whites to a stiff froth. 
Add the fruit to the jelly ; mix ; then add the whites. 
Beat thoroughly together with as few strokes as possible. 
Rinse out 2 pint-moulds with cold water; fill with the 
mixture, and set away on the ice to harden. Turn out on 
cut paper, and serve very cold with cream or Whipped- 
Cream Sauce (see receipt). 

ORANGE JELLY IN BASKETS. 
GEL^E A L'ORANGE. 

12 oranges, • i box of Cox's gelatine, 

I gill of cura9oa, Sugar to taste. 

Squeeze the oranges, which should be fine, large Floridas ; 
extract every drop of juice. Put a boxful of gelatine, with 
enough of the juice to cover it well, to soak for i hour or 
more. Now set the bowl in boiling water and stir until the 
gelatine is dissolved. Add the rest of the juice ; sweeten to 
taste. Then add a wine-glass of best cura9oa. Strain the 
jelly through a very fine strainer or coarse muslin, and set to 
harden in a mould which has been rinsed out with cold 
water. There should be i quart and i pint of jelly in all. 
If the oranges have not yielded all the juice required, make 
up the quantity of liquid by adding boiling water. This 
jelly is not crystal-clear, but is delicious. If you can take 
the time and trouble, it is much prettier to serve the jelly in 
.orange-baskets made as follows : 

Before making the jelly, cut your oranges in this way : 
have a very sharp knife with which make a cut across the 



4^4 GOOD.LIVING. 

stem end of the orange, just escaping the hole of the stem, 
and going |-way through the fruit ; \ an inch from this, 
make a second cut the same depth ; this will make the 
handle, so that the stem-hole must not appear in it, or in- 
deed anywhere on the basket. Now turn the fruit, and 
make an incision at right angles to the cut made for the han- 
\ die, which 2 cuts must join, thus detaching a piece like a 
small quarter of the orange. Turn the fruit to the opposite 
side and do the same, being careful that the 2 side-cuts are 
exactly on a level. This makes the basket. Now, with a 
sharp knife, carefully cut the fruit from the inner-side of the 
handle and basket, taking the greatest care not to pierce the 
skin anywhere. Loosen it with a teaspoon and scoop out 
fruit, juice, seeds, and all the pithy, white pulp that can be 
safely scraped away. Save every drop of the juice for the jelly 
as first directed. The quantity of jelly given in the receipt 
should fill the I2 baskets quite full, leaving a little over, which 
put on a shallow dish and set away to harden with the rest. 
When firm, tie colored bows of fresh ribbon on the handles 
of the baskets ; dish them on a pretty, round dish ; crumb 
up with a fork the extra jelly in the shallow dish, and pile it 
around and between the baskets. This makes really such a 
pretty and delicious dessert, at so little expense, that if you 
have time to give to it, it will repay you for the trouble. At 
the pastry-cook's, you will pay $3.50 to $4.00 a dozen for 
these, which, made at home, and quite as good, will not cost 
more than 75 cents, in winter, when oranges are plentiful, 

N. B. — Use pure orange-juice for the jelly as far as possU 
ble, adding boiling water only if absolutely necessary. 

LEMON JELLY. 
GEL^E AU CITRON. 

1 ounce of Cox's gelatine, 2 gills of cold water, 

5 large lemons, juice only, White and shell of 1 egg, 

2 cups of soft sugar, or to taste, i^ pints of boiling water. 

Soak the gelatine in the cold water for 2 hours. Cut a 
few strips of lemon-rind ; put these to soak with the gela- 



WINE JELLY. 465 

tine. Now pour the boiling water on the gelatine ; add 
sugar, lemon-juice, and white of egg, slightly beaten, also 
the shell, crushed. Let it boil briskly for 3 minutes ; then 
set the kettle on the hearth for 5 minutes. Skim. Pass 
through a jelly-bag, once or twice, until suiificiently clear. 
Rinse out a large mould with cold water ; fill with the jelly 
and set in a cold place to harden. Turn out on a cut paper 
and serve with or without Custard Sauce (see receipt). 

PLUM-PUDDING MADE OVER. 

Line a Charlotte- Russe mould with slices of cold Plum- 
Pudding or Wedding Cake, fitted closely together. Fill the 
centre with Gelatine Pudding or Velvet Cream (see receipts). 
Set in a cold place to harden. When firm, turn out and 
serve with a cold Custard or Brandy Sauce (see receipts), 
poured around. 

WINE JELLY. 
gel:£e au vin de mad^re. 

I box of Cox's gelatine, i pint of cold water, 

1 pint of sheny, with a little brandy, 3 lemons, juice and peel, 
l^ pounds of soft sugar, i quart of boiling water, 

2 whites of eggs, well beaten, 2 shells of eggs, crushed, 

I small stick of cinnamon, about 2 inches long. 

Soak the gelatine in cold water for i hour or more. Then 
pour over it the boiling water. Add eggs, shells, sugar, 
lemon-juice, and the yellow part of the rind, and cinnamon. 
Bring to a boil. Let it boil 3 minutes without stirring, then 
set it on the hearth for 5 minutes. Skim. Add the wine, 
which should be perfectly clear. Pass all through a jelly-bag 
"once, or until clear. Rinse out moulds with cold water. 
Fill with the jelly and set away in a cold place to harden. 
Champagne, brandy, madeira, maraschino, rum, or kirsch 
may be added, in combination or separately, to the above, if 
the quantity of wine does not exceed the proportions set 
30 



466 GOOD-LIVING. 

down. In summer, less water should be used, as the jelly 
does not harden so easily : the quantity of liquid should then 
measure 3 pints in all. 

FANCY JELLY. 

gel:^e fantaisie. 

1 box of Cox's gelatine, Juice of 2 lemons, 

2 gills of sherry, " " "oranges, 
2 " " cold water, i pound of sugar, 

I gill of brandy, I quart of boiling water. 

Cover the gelatine with the cold water and soak i hour or 
more. ' Add sugar and boiling water. Set over the fire and 
stir until sugar and gelatine are dissolved. Add lemon- and 
orange-juice, sherry, and brandy. Rinse out a mould with 
cold water. Fill it with jelly, strained through a jelly-bag or 
fine sieve. Set away to harden. The jelly will not be per- 
fectly clear on account of the fruit-juice, but the excellence 
of its flavor will more than compensate for its slight cloudi- 
ness. 

N. B. — In summer lessen the quantity of cold water, as the 
weather will prevent its hardening as well as in winter. The 
liquid should in this case measure 3 pints in all. 

MACEDOINE OF FRUIT. 

MAC^DOINE DE FRUITS. 

Make very clear Wine Jelly (see receipt). Champagne is 
recommended for the jelly. Have ready either small fresh 
fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, cherries, sliced apri- 
cots or peaches, or sections of oranges skinned and seeded ; 
or use preserved or brandied fruits — these last preferably. 
Rinse out the mould in cold water. Pour in jelly to the 
depth of \ an inch. Set on the ice to harden. Keep the 
rest of the jelly cool, but where it will not harden. When 
the jelly in the mould is set, lay in some fruit, neatly and 
tastefully ; pour over this only just enough jelly to barely 



TIPSY CAKE. 467 

cover (any more will make the fruit float). Set away again 
to harden. Repeat this process until the mould is filled. If 
preferred, alternate with layers of plain jelly. When full, 
set away for several hours to harden well. If there is any 
plain jelly left, set it aside, and when it is stiffening, beat it 
to a froth and serve around the Mac^doine. Or set it to 
harden in shallow dishes, and, when ready for use, crumb it 
with a fork and heap it around the base of the Mac^doine 
when ready to serve, turned out on a dish. This adds 
greatly to the effect of this very pretty dessert. 

PINE-APPLE SNOW. 

NEIGE A L'aNANAS. 

4 whites o£ eggs, 4 tablespoons of powdered sugar, 

r pint of cream, whipped, i pine-apple. 

Pare, remove the eyes, and grate the pine-apple. Put the 
pulp upon a sieve to drain. Mix the snow as directed in 
receipt for Snow Cream. When all is ready and the cream 
whipped very stiff, beat in the pine-apple pulp, adding as 
much as the cream and meringue will hold without becoming 
too soft. Serve very cold in custard glasses. 



TRIFLE. 




Cream, 


Sherry, 


Raspberry-jam, 


Cake. 



Put I layer of stale cake. Sponge or Layer Cake No. I. or 
No. II. (see receipts) in the bottom of a round dish ; spread 
it over with a thick layer of raspberry- or strawberry-jam 
or jelly ; baste it, by the spoonful, with sherry until the cake 
will absorb no more. Beat about r pint of rich cream to a 
very stiff froth (see receipt)^ Heap this over the cake, and 
decorate to taste. Very simple and delicious. 

TIPSY CAKE. 

PAN BORACHO. 

Prepare the stale cake as above with jam and wine. Make 
about I pint of rich Custard (see receipt), and pour it over 



468 GOOD-LIVING. 

the cake. Reserve 2 of the whites of egg from the custard 
and beat them to a stiff froth ; a little jelly may be beaten 
through the whites when they are stiff. Heap this over the 
custard, and serve very cold. Or, serve in individual cus- 
tard-glasses. Delicious. 

ITALIAN CUSTARD. 

CRfeME ITALIENNE. 

Allow I egg to each person. Beat the yolks to a cream ; 
add sugar and lemon-juice to taste, beating all the while. 
The eggs should thicken like cream. Put this into custard- 
glasses. Beat the whites to a stiff froth. When perfectly 
stiff, whip in a little currant-jelly, and beat until evenly col- 
ored. Heap this upon the custard in the glasses. Set in 
the ice-box, and serve very cold. Delicious. 

BOILED CUSTARD. 

CRiME. 

1 quart of new milk, 5 eggs, 

2^ tablespoons of sugar. Flavoring to taste. 

Small pindx of salt, 

Put the milk on the fire in a farina-kettle. Beat the eggs 
together in a bowl with the sugar and salt, until creamy. 
When the milk is boiling, pour it by degrees into the eggs 
and sugar, very gradually, stirring briskly all the time. 
Strain this back into the farina-kettle ; set it again on the 
fire where it will heat, but not boil, or it will curdle. Stir 
constantly until it thickens. Remove from the fire, and add 
flavoring to taste. Set away to cool. The only danger in 
making boiled custard is that it may curdle. If the above 
directions are strictly observed, and new milk used for the 
purpose, it will not curdle. Or, the custard may be made 
with yolks only, allowing 6 to the quart of milk. It must* 
be stirred longer over the fire, as it will thicken more slowly. 
In this latter case, the whites of eggs may be used for Angel 
Cake, etc., etc. (see receipts). 



CARAMEL CUSTARD. 469 

CRkME BACH I QUE. 

I pint of good white wine, 7 or 8 yolks of eggs, 

Lemon-peel or stick-cinnamon, Sugar to taste. 

Put the wine, lemon-peel, or cinnamon, and sugar (about i 
gill) into a saucepan. Bring it slowly to a boil. Beat the 
yolks of eggs to a cream. When the wine boils, remove it 
and pour gently upon the yolks, stirring briskly all the time. 
Add more sugar if required. Have ready small custard-' 
cups in a baking-pan. Strain the custard into the cups. 
Pour boiling water into the pan to about half the height of 
the cups, and bake in a moderately-quick oven until set, 
from 10 to 12 minutes. Do not let them harden too much. 
'Serve very cold. 

BAKED COFFEE CUSTARD. 

CRtME AU CAF£. 

I quart of new milk, 6 eggs, 

3 heaping tablespoons of ground coffee, Sugar to taste. 

Use, if you can, Mocha and Java coffees mixed. Grind 
the coffee. Put it into a saucepan with the milk ; bring it 
to boiling point ; then set it aside on the range and let it 
steep for about 1 5 minutes, covered. Meanwhile, break the 
eggs into a bowl and beat enough to mix. Add about 3 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and beat well together. Bring the 
coffee and milk once more to a boil and strain it, boiling, 
into the bowl of eggs, stirring briskly. Sweeten to taste. 
Have ready 12 small custard-cups in a baking-pan. Strain 
the custard into the cups. Fill the pan with boiling water 
to half the height of the custard-cups. Bake in a moder- 
ately-quick oven 10 to 12 minutes, until the custard is just 
set; do not let it bake hard. It will become firmer as it 

cools. 

CARAMEL CUSTARD. 

CRiME AU CARAMEL. 

I pint of brown sugar, 3 pints of milk, 

7 eggs 

Melt the sugar, until liquid, in a frying-pan, then add it 
slowly to the boiling milk, stirring constantly. Beat the 



470 GOOD-LIVING. 

eggs in a bowl. Stir the boiling milk into them by degrees, 
stirring briskly all the while. Have ready small custard-cups 
in a baking-pan. Strain the custard into the cups. Fill the 
pan with boiling water to half the height of the cups ; put 
it into a moderately-quick oven for lo to 12 minutes, until 
set, but not hard. It will grow firmer as it cools. Serve 
very cold. 



CHOCOLA TE AND OTHER BAKED CUSTARDS. 

CRi:ME AU CHOCOLAT, ETC. 

Proceed exactly as directed for Coffee Custard, using, in- 
stead, vanilla or other flavoring to taste. If chocolate is 
used, allow about 2 ounces of Maillard's or Huyler's best to 
I quart of milk. Dissolve the chocolate in the milk, and 
proceed as directed, using 12 small cups or i large dish. 

COLD CUSTARD OR JUNKET. 

I quart of new milk, Sugar to taste, 

I tablespoon of rennet. 

Heat the milk to blood-heat, but do not boil. Have ready 
in a glass bowl the rennet and sugar. When the milk is 
warm, not scalding, pour it into the bowl, stirring only just 
enough to mix. Grate nutmeg over the top, and set in a 
cool place until the milk becomes firm. Serve very cold. 
Whey for the use of invalids may be made in lik6 manner, 
using a little more rennet. When it has stood long enough, 
the curd will separate and the whey can be drained off. A 
little sherry or vanijla may be added to the above as 
flavoring. 

SLIP. 

The same as Junket, flavored with Jamaica rum. Serve 
very cold with a pitcher of cream.

I quart of new milk. Sugar to taste, 

4 heaping tablespoons of corn-starch, 2 ounces of grated chocolate, 

I teaspoon of vanilla. 

When the milk has come to a boil, pour it into a bowl 
over the grated chocolate ; when dissolved, return to the fire 
and stir smooth. Measure the corn-starch into a small bowl ; 
pour a little cold water on it and rub until absolutely smooth, 
adding just enough cold water to make it pour easily. When 
the milk boils, pour in the corn-starch and stir constantly 
until it thickens and cooks thoroughly, 4 or 5 minutes. 
Taste to see that the corn-starch is perfectly smooth and 
cooked ; if not, " stir and boil longer. Remove from the 
fire ; stir in enough sugar to make it very sweet, and vanilla 
to taste. The yolks of 2 eggs may be added if liked, but 
are not necessary. Rinse a 3-pint mould with cold water ; 
drain and pour in the mixture, which should be quite thick. 
Set away for several hours in a cold place until firm. Serve 
with good cream or cold Custard Sauce (see receipt). The 
blanc-mange should be very firm when turned out. If made 
as above, it should be perfectly smooth and free from lumps.

as above. 

CORN-STARCH BLANC-MANGE. 

I quart of new milk, I gill of sugar, 

8 level tablespoons of corn-starch, Pinch of salt, 

Flavoring to taste. 

Bring the milk to a boil in a farina-kettle. Blend the 
corn-starch with a little cold milk, and, when the milk in the 
kettle boils, stir in the corn-starch. Stir without intermission 
until it thickens, about 5 minutes. Taste to see that the 
corn-starch is perfectly smooth ; if not, boil a little longer. 
Remove from the fire ; stir in the sugar, salt, and flavoring. 
Rinse out a mould with cold water. Pour in the corn-starch 
and set away on the ice to cool and harden. Serve very 
cold with Custard Sauce, flavored with vanilla, 

N. B. — The above is greatly improved by the addition, 
when removed from the fire, of 2 eggs well beaten in. Fin- 
ish as directed. 

RODGROD (DANISH). 

Take fresh raspberries ; sweeten to taste and set in a china- 
lined saucepan on the fire to scald. When the fruit begins 
to dissolve, press it through a sieve, taking all but the seeds. 
Put the juice again on the fire, measuring the quantity. To 
every quart of juice, allow about 3 heaping tablespoonfuls 
of corn-starch. Blend the corn-starch with a little of the 
cold juice. When the juice in the saucepan comes to a boil, 
stir in the corn-starch and continue to stir until it has boiled 
3 to 5 minutes, is thick and transparent (not milky). Taste 
to see that the corn-starch is perfectly smooth ; if not, boil a 
little longer* Remove from the fire and stir in currant-jelly 
to taste. (Or some fresh currants may be stewed with the 



TAPIOCA JELLY. 473 

raspberries, allowing about i part of currants to 3 parts of 
raspberries.) Have ready blanched about 2 gills of almonds 
to I quart of juice. Cut the almonds into shreds and stir 
them into the mixture. Rinse out a mould with cold water ; 
fill with the mixture, and set away to harden. It should not 
become quite as stiff as blanc-mange. Serve in a glass dish 
with a pitcher of very thick cream. Or, the same may be 
made with Cox's gelatine, using i ounce of gelatine to I 
quart of juice. Delicious.

Stew any kind of fresh fruit, such as raspberries, strawber- 
ries, etc. ; strain off the juice and sweeten to taste. Measure 
the juice and put it again on the fire. To every pint of 
juice allow 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of corn-starch, blended 
with a little cold water. When the juice boils, stir in the 
corn-starch, and continue to stir until the corn-starch is 
thoroughly done, which will require about 5 minutes' boil- 
ing. Taste, and if perfectly smooth, pour it into moulds 
which have been rinsed out with cold water. Set in a cold 
place to harden ; when firm, turn out and serve with cream 
and sugar. It may be set to harden in small teacups. Recom-

Soak the tapioca in water overnight. Next day put the 
milk on to boil ; dry the tapioca and stir it into the milk. 
Boil until thoroughly tender, about 30 minutes. Beat the 
yolks of the eggs. Remove the tapioca from the fire ; flavor, 
sweeten, and stir in the yolks very carefully. Return to the 
fire over boiling water and stir for 2 or 3 minutes, but do not 
boil, or the eggs will curdle. Set away to cool. Beat the 
whites of eggs to a stiff froth. When the tapioca is very 
cold, whip in half of the whites. Put into custard-glasses. 
To the remaining whites, add powdered sugar to the thick- 
ness of a mdringue, and heap this on the top of the whip. 
Serve very cold.

COQUETTES. 475 

the fire until perfectly smooth and until so thick that it be- 
gins to leave the sides of the saucepan. Then remove from 
the fire ; beat in the eggs, one at a time ; beat very hard ; 
add finally the white, beaten to a stiff froth. The batter 
should be thick enough to drop slowly from the spoon. Set 
in the ice-box for 2 hours. Have ready in a saucepan the 
lard, which should be at least 2 inches deep when melted, so 
that the beignets may puff and cook without touching the 
bottom. Bring the lard to a boil; test it with a piece of 
the batter. If it is ready, drop in pieces of the batter as 
large as a nut. Fry until golden-brown on all sides. Re- 
move with a skimmer to a paper in the mouth of the oven, 
to dry, and when ready to serve, sift powdered sugar over 
them. Pile in a pyramid on a cut paper and serve very hot. 
They should be round and very light, if successful. 



COQUETTES. 

I ounce of butter, i pint of flour, 

r pint of boiling water, 5 eggs. 

Put the water in the saucepan, and, when boiling, remove 
from the fire and stir in the flour, mixing well. Stir it over 
the fire until it thickens and begins to leave the sides of the 
saucepan. Remove it, beat in the butter and the eggs, one 
at a time, very thoroughly. Have ready deep boiling lard. 
When boiling, drop in the batter by bits the size of a walnut. 
For directions for frying, see Beignets Souffles. Fry golden 
brown. Remove with a skimmer to a piece of brown paper 
in the mouth of the oven to drain ; sift with fine sugar and 
serve in a pyramid on cut paper. The batter requires a great 
deal of beating, both before, and when, the eggs are in, but 
(the receipt goes on to say) " the coquettes are so beautiful 
and delicious that one is repaid for the trouble of making 
them." 

N. B. — This batter baked in spoonfuls on tin makes crusts 
for Cream Puffs.

ing-powder (or cream of tartar). Add the eggs well beaten 



OMELETTE SOUFFLES. 479 

together ; mix. Add molasses and enough cold water to 
make a very stiff batter. (If you use soda, it should now be 
dissolved in a few spoonfuls of boiling water and beaten into 
the mixture.) Have ready boiling in a pot, lard 3 inches deep. 
When you have tested it and found that it is ready (see Gen- 
eral Directions for Frying), drop in the batter by the small

4 ounces of powdered sugar, 4 eggs, 

Pinch of salt, Vanilla to taste. 

Put a pudding-dish where it will become, gradually, thor- 
oughly hot, while you prepare the soufifld. If a plated cover- 
ing is used to send the dish to table, heat that also. Have 
the oven very hot. 

Break the whites and yolks in separate bowls. Beat the 
yolks until not only creamy, but pale yellow. Then beat into 
the yolks the sifted sugar and about a teaspoonful of vanilla ; 
beat again until smooth. Now add a pinch of salt to the 
white of eggs (it makes them beat more easily), and whip 
them to a perfectly stiff, dry froth. A second person should 
beat the yolks while the whites are being beaten. When 
every thing is ready, beat the yolks into the whites, stirring 
just as little as possible, taking always from the bottom up- 
ward, only enough to mix. Have the heafed pudding-dish 
well buttered. Fill not more than |-full of the mixture; 



48o GOOD-LIVING. 

dredge the top with powdered sugar. Set in a quick oven. 
It will require only about 6 minutes, if the oven is right. Do 
not let it stand an ' instant. It must be waited for, rather 
than wait. To be successful, the details must be strictly 
observed, and the eggs beaten unsparingly.

broad, and S inches long. Having removed the crusts, dip 
the bread first into the sweetened milk, then into the rum. 
Drain. Have ready, in a frying-pan, deep boiling lard. 
When certain that it is boiling (see General Directions for 
Frying), lay in the bread. Fry golden-brown. Remove 
with a skimmer to brown paper in the oven. When dry, 
place on a hot dish, 2 and 2 at right angles. Sift powdered 
sugar and cinnamon over them, and serve with Custard 
Sauce (see receipt) flavored with rum. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH'S TOAST. 

PAIN PERDU. 

Proceed exactly as for Torrijas, cutting the slices the same 
thickness, but larger, and omitting the rum. Fry in butter, 
browning both sides. Serve with mixed cinnamon and sugar. 

PANCAKES. 
CRAPES. 

1 egg, 4 ounces of sifted flour. 

syi gills of milk, Pinch of salt. 

Beat the egg, yolk and white together; add it and the 
salt to the milk, then pour these upon the flour and mix 
perfectly smooth. The batter must be no thicker than 
good cream. Have a small frying-pan very hot ; grease it 
thoroughly with butter or drippings. Pour in batter enough 
to only just cover the bottom. In a minute, perhaps less, if 
the pan is very hot, the cake can be turned. This part is 
done by sleight of hand by very experienced cooks, who toss 
it, catching it again in the pan, bringing the brown side up. 
This is not recommended to beginners ; it will be found 
safer, if slower, to use the cake-turner. The great secret of 
good pancakes is to have them as thin as possible and very 
tender. As they are cooked, pile them on a hot plate. When 
ready to serve, spread each with jelly and roll it up ; or 
sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon mixed, and roll. Dish 
them very neatly and serve very hot. 



CURRANT CHARLOTTE. 483

STRAWBERRY SARACEN. 

Strawberries, Sugar, 

Slices of thin toast, Batter. 

Butter the toast generously, and line with it the bottom 
and sides of a china dish which can be set in the oven. The 
pieces of toast, made of stale bread and cut quite thin, should 
be very well dried in toasting ; they should be trimmed to 
fit into the dish neatly. Fill, the remaining space with 
stemmed strawberries, packed closely. Sift plenty of sugar 
over and among the berries, and set in a moderate oven for 
30 minutes, or until the fruit has melted a good deal, and 
settled. It will be found that they melt away so much that 
the dish must not only be packed but heaped, or it will not 
look well when done. Serve very cold with thick cream. 
Delicious.

to stiffen. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth ; stir 
the apples over ice until perfectly smooth, then stir in the 
whites of eggs and continue to stir until thick. Rinse out 
a mould with cold water. Fill with the mixture and set 
away to harden. Prepare a Custard Sauce (see receipt) 
flavored with rum or vanilla. Turn out the sponge ; pour 
the custard around it, and. serve very cold. 

PEACH SPONGE. 

MOUSSE AUX PfeCHES. 

Proceed exactly as for Apple Sponge, substituting peaches 
in the same proportions. 



ORANGE SALAD. 487 

BAKED QUINCES. 

Core ripe apple-quinces of uniform size. Place them in a 
baking-pan. Put the cores in the pan. Fill the spaces left 
by the cores with sugar, adding to the pan about i gill (for 
8 quinces). Fill the pan with boiling water to \ the height 
of the quinces. Cover with an inverted pan. Set in the 
oven for 30 minutes. Then uncover and continue to bake 
until the quinces are tender, which will require perhaps an 
hour or more. The oven should be moderately hot. When 
tender, dish the quinces. Set the pan over the fire, and boil 
briskly for a few minutes, adding more sugar, if not sweet 
enough ; strain the syrup over the fruit, and set away. Serve 
cold with cream. Recommended. 

FRIED BANANAS. 

BANANES FRITES. 

Having peeled the bananas, cut them in two, lengthwise. 
Have ready hot butter in the frying-pan. Lay in the 
bananas. Sift with powdered sugar. Fry brown one side ; 
then turn ; sift again with sugar ; when the second side is 
browned, dish neatly and serve hot. 

ORANGE SALAD. 

SALADE D'ORANGES. 

4 oranges, i gill of Jamaica rum. 

Powdered sugar. 

Select very juicy oranges (Indian Rivers are best). Peel 
and slice in thin slices. Sift sugar over each layer in a glass 
dish ; pour the rum over all. Cover, and set away for. 2 hours 
in a cool place. Baste from time to time. Or, the oranges 
may be washed and sliced without peeling ; then dressed as 
above. 



438 GOOD-LIVING. 

APPLE AND ORANGE SALAD. 

3 oranges, 2 apples, 

I gill of rum Powdered sugar. 

Peel and shave the apples in very thin slices ; mix with 
the oranges, and finish as directed for Orange Salad. 

PIE-PLANT OR RHUBARB. 

Draw off the outer skin and fibres, beginning at the top. 
Use a silver knife. Cut the pie-plant in 2-inch lengths. Lay 
it in a fire-proof bake-dish ; sprinkle soft sugar over it, allow- 
ing about pound to pound. H^eap the dish with fruit, as it 
will shrink a great deal. Set the dish in a moderately-quick 
oven, and bake for about 30 minutes, or until perfectly 
tender, and surrounded by a rich syrup. If the oven is too 
hot, cover with a tin pie-plate, as the pie-plant must not 
brown. It may be served, when cold, in a glass dish, plain ; 
or the dish may be lined with macaroons and filled with the 
pie-plant. This mode of preparing the pie-plant, when once 
tested, will prove so satisfactory that it is safe to say that it 
will be adopted in preference to stewing. Should the old 
way be preferred, however, scald the pie-plant first and throw 
the water off before adding the sugar. This does away with 
a. certain amount of the extreme acidity. 

TO PREPARE STRA WBERRIES FOR TABLE. 

Do not wash them unless they absolutely require it. If, 
however, you are obliged to, do not stem them until after 
washing and draining thoroughly. Do not sugar them until 
they are served at table. If washing is necessary, fill a large 
bowl with cold water ; put the strawberries in a colander, and 
dip the colander 2 or 3 times into the bowl. Shake out well, 
and stand colander and berries near the ice until wanted. 
Then stem them. In France, handsome extra-large berries 
are always served in a pyramid, with the stems on. They 
are dipped in sugar, one by one, and eaten from the stem. 



TO PREPARE PINEIAPPLE FOR TABLE. 489 

TO PREPARE PINE-APPLE FOR TABLE. 

Be sure the pine is perfectly ripe. Pare it from the top 
down. Remove the eyes. Hold the top in the left hand, 
and with a fork held in the right, scoop the fruit o£f from the 
core in pieces about 2 inches square. Place these in a glass 
dish ; sift with powdered sugar, and set away in the ice-box 
until required. Never cut a pine-apple with a knife in slices 
through the core ; it is much less digestible, and its flavor is 
injured by contact with the knife. When properly prepared, 
core and top-leaves should remain in one piece. 




ICE-CREAMS, WATER-ICES, ETC. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING ICE-CREAMS, WATER. 

ICES, ETC. 

The essentials for making good plain (Philadelphia) cream 
are : the best cream, ripe, juicy fruit, and granulated sugar. 
Avoid, for this class of ice-cream, all thickening, whether 
corn-starch, arrow-root, or gelatine. These latter are neces- 
sary in many of the fancy creams, but not for the above. It 
is best to scald, not boil the cream, the sugar being dissolved 
in it while hot. The flavoring, whether fruit or other, will be 
stronger if added after the first freezing. Avoid freezing the 
cream raw, as it is never as smooth, but acquires a harshness 
and a snowy taste ; it increases much more in bulk. 

Procure the best of freezers, such as the " White Moun- 
tain " ; see that all is in perfect readiness before beginning 
the operation. For a 4-quart freezer, allow about 10 pounds 
of ice and 2 quarts of rock-salt. The ice must be pounded 
finer at the commencement of the operation than later on. 
Set in the tin cylinder ; fill ^ or at most f -full of the mixture, 
allowing always ample room for it to swell as it freezes. Cover. 
Adjust the crank. Turn to see that all is right. Now put in 
the ice 3 inches deep, then salt i inch deep, and so on, in lay- 
ers, to the top of the can. Now turn steadily and not too 
rapidly, until the crank works very hard. This should take 
about 25 minutes. It is not well to freeze it too fast. Now 
unscrew the crank ; wipe the lid ; remove it and the dasher. 
With a long flat piece of wood (spatula), scrape down the in- 
ner sides, and beat vigorously for 10 minutes. This makes 

490 



VANILLA ICE-CREAM WITH EGGS. 49I 

the cream smooth. Now replace the cover and plug up the 
dasher-hole. In all this be very careful that no salt creeps 
in. Drain off the water from the pail and re-pack with salt 
and coarser ice. Cover with a thick piece of carpet and set 
away for 2 hours. This last makes the cream mellow. Or, 
the cream at this stage may be packed in a mould ; the 
mould placed in an ordinary pail, which fill with layers of salt 
and ice ; cover and set away as above. 

N. B. — Be careful that the mould-lid is closely fitted, or 
the salt may penetrate. 

PHILADELPHIA VANILLA ICE-CREAM. 

I quart of cream, ^ pound of sugar, 

I vanilla bean or 2 tablespoons of extract of vanilla. 

Put the sugar, i pint of cream, and the bean, split in ^, into 
a farina-kettle ; boil and stir constantly for 10 minutes. Re- 
move from the fire ; strain ; set away to cool. When cold, 
add extract of vanilla (if you use this), and the remaining 
cream, and freeze. Finish according to General Directions 
for Freezing. 

VANILLA ICE-CREAM WITH EGGS. 

CRfeME GLAO^E A LA VANILLE. 

8 eggs, yolks only, 2 tablespoons of cold water, 

lyi, pints of rich milk, ^ pound of sugar, 

I tablespoon of vanilla-bean powder, % box of gelatine, 

I pint of cream, whipped. 

Cream together the yolks of the eggs and sugar very light. 
Put the milk in a farina-kettle on the fire with the vanilla. 
Bring it to a boil ; remove it and stir by degrees into the 
eggs and sugar, stirring briskly. Set the farina-kettle with 
the custard over hot water on the fire, and stir constantly 
until it thickens slightly. Do not let it boil, or it will curdle. 
Remove from the fire, and stir in the gelatine, which has 
soaked for 2 hours in the cold water. Stir. The heat of the 



492 GOOD-LIVING. 

custard should be sufficient to melt it ; if not, stir it" over the 
fire until dissolved. Strain the custard into a bowl, and set 
aside to cool thoroughly before freezing. When cold, have 
ready freezer, salt, and ice. Pour the custard into the tin 
cylinder ; pack with ice and salt and turn steadily (see Gen- 
eral Directions for Ice-Creams). When the crank will scarcely 
turn any more, wipe off the top of the cylinder very care- 
fully, scrape down the cream from the sides, and pour in the 
Whipped Cream (which has been first chilled and then whipped 
over a pan of ice, see receipt). Close the cylinder and freezer, 
being very careful that no salt gets inside. Turn again un. 
til too stiff, then carefully remove the dasher ; scrape all the 
ice-cream down again ; smooth it over ; re-cover ; put a stop- 
per in the hole in the tin cover ; pack with more salt and 
ice ; cover with carpet and set away for 2 or 3 hours ; or 
pack in a mould in the same way, filling the mould very 
full, and packing it in a pail of ice and salt.

the sugar and salt. Remove from the fire, and stir carefully 
into the 3 beaten yolks of eggs. Return for i minute or 2 
to the fire, stirring constantly, but do not boil. Set away to 
cool. Meanwhile, have the cream standing on ice. Whip it 
and the 6 whites of eggs separately, to a thick froth. When 
the first mixture is cold, add the flavoring, and, just at the 
moment of freezing, add the beaten cream and eggs (see 
General Directions for Freezing Ice-Creams).

6 ounces Maillard's or Huyler's chocolate. 

Put the milk into the farina-kettle and bring it to a boil. 
Grate the chocolate into a bowl. Add to it the eggs and 
sugar, and beat until well mixed. When the milk boils, 
stir it gently into the eggs, etc., stirring rapidly. When the 
chocolate is well melted, turn all back into the farina-kettle ; 
place on the fire over hot water, and stir until the custard 
thickens a little, but do not let it boil. Strain the custard 
into a bowl and set away to cool. When cold, turn it into the 
freezer ; pack as directed in General Directions for Freezing 
Ice-Creams, and when quite stiff, carefully open the freezer 
and put in the cream, which has been whipped with a Dover 
egg-beater in a bowl over a pan of cracked ice. Shut the 
freezer ; turn again until very stiff ; then pack the ice-cream 
in a mould, filling it very closely ; put the cover on tightly ; 
cover the crack with a strip of muslin dipped in butter, to 
keep Cut the salt ; pack in a pail with salt and ice ; cover 
with a piece of carpet, and set in a cool place for i or 2 
hours. This ice-cream is very reliable, and delicious.

a fine sieve until all the strength is pressed out. Add the 
sugar and stir until dissolved. When perfectly cold, add the 
remaining pint of cream, and freeze (see General Directions 
for Freezing Ice-Creams). When frozen, pack and stand 2 
hours as directed. 



494 GOOD-LIVING, 

PARFAIT A U CAF£. 

1 quart of thick cream, i gill of strong black coffee, 

^ Cup of powdered sugar. 

Mix the coffee, sugar, and cream ; whip to a froth. As 
the froth appears, skim it off to a colander to drain. What- 
ever drains off may be whipped again. Use a Dover egg- 
beater, and stand the cream in a pan of cracked ice while 
you beat it. This will greatly facilitate the whipping. 
When all is done, turn it into an ice-cream mould ; press 
the lid down tightly ; bind the joint with a strip of muslin 
dipped in melted butter (to keep out the salt) ; pack in salt 
and ice, the layers of ice being 3 inches, and salt r inch, deep. 
Cover with a piece of carpet and set in a cold place for 3

2 ' ' citron, chopped, %, pound chocolate, 

2 cups sugar, 2 eggs, 

3 whites of eggs, or whipped cream for sauce. 

Boil the milk ; dissolve the chocolate in it. Rub the arrow- 
root up with a little cold milk or water, and stir in. When 
thickened, stir in very carefully the 2 eggs mixed smooth 
with a few drops of cold water. Stir and set aside to get 
cold. Add the fruit and flavorings. Whip the cream and 
add the sugar to it. At the moment of freezing, add this to 
the chocolate. Pack in a mould (see General Directions for

lay a layer of mixed fruits, using preserved, candied, and 



ALASKA OR ROASTED ICE-CREAM. 499 

brandied fruits of any kind, raisins, and marrons glacis. Put 
the fruit in bit by bit, carefully. Cover this with cake, leav- 
ing a space at the sides, between the cake and the mould ; 
repeat this until the mould is nearly filled. Have ready the 
custard prepared according to the receipt given for Boiled 
Custard. When it is boiling hot, dissolve the gelatine in it ; 
strain and set aside to cool. When cold, pour the custard 
into the mould very carefully ; fill the mould not quite full ; 
fit the cover closely ; seal the crack with a strip of muslin 
dipped in melted butter. Set in a tub of ice and salt ; the 
ice being 3 inches, the salt i inch, deep. Cover with a carpet 
and set in a cold place about 6 hours. See that the ice is 
kept over it ; renew if necessary. When ready, turn out of 
the mould and serve with Whipped Cream Sauce.

Pack in a mould. 

ALASKA, OR ROASTED ICE-CREAM. 

Use the lower half of a round sponge-cake as the base ; 
upon this place a small, very solidly-frozen form of ice-cream. 
Cover this thickly with a very stiff meringue of sugar and 
white of egg. Sprinkle with sugar. Heat a salamander, or, 
the kitchen shovel, red-hot, and hold it sufiSciently close to 
the meringue to brown it on all sides. This gives the ap- 
pearance of having been roasted, and at the same time the 



500 GOOD-LIVING. 

ice-cream remains perfectly frozen. The uninitiated are 
quite convinced that it is roasted, and are much amazed 
at this culinary curiosity.

PRESERVES AND CANDIES. 

Note. — Never make preserves on a damp day. Never 
use fruit picked in wet weather. ' 

SYRUP FOR PRESERVES. 

2 pounds Jjest white sugar, i pint of fresh water, 

I white of egg. 

Put all into a white, china-lined kettle. Stir well. Set on 
the fire and bring to a boil. Watch that the syrup does not 
rise too rapidly, and let it boil five minutes. It must bubble, 
froth, and rise before it will clear. Draw it on one side of 
the range and let it settle ; then skim it very thoroughly. 
If the syrup at any time rises too quickly and threatens to 
boil over, if you cannot remove the kettle easily, throw in a 
dash of cold water and it will be checked immediately ; then 
you can safely move it to one side. The kettle, on ac- 
count of this, should be much larger than seems necessary. 

PEACHES PRESERVED IN SYRUP. 

Prepare the syrup as directed above. Peel ; cut in half ; 
remove the stones ; when • the syrup has been skimmed 
and brought again to a boil, drop in a few peaches at a time ; 
boil until thoroughly tender, 15 to 20 minutes. They 
should be tender enough to pierce with a whisp. Drain out 
the fruit and put it in the jars. When all are done, boil down 
the syrup rapidly for 20 minutes or more, but be careful that 
it does not scorch. If any scum rises,, remove it. Fill the 
jars with the boiling syrup, having previously poured off the 

505 



5o6 GOOD-LIVING. 

thin syrup from them. Set aside to cool. When cold, 
screw the tops on. If in open jars, cover first with brandied 
papers, then with white paper fastened on with flour-paste. 
Clean, label, and set away. 

Pears may be preserved according to above receipt. 



BRANDIED PEACHES. 

Select for this purpose white peaches that are not too ripe : 
Morris Whites, Smocks, or White Heath, are considered 
best for the purpose. Peel very carefully,' so that the mark 
of the knife shall not be visible. If well done, this saves, too, 
the troublesome process of skinning with lye. Melt in a 
porcelain-lined kettle 2 pounds of granulated sugar in 3 
quarts of water. Weigh the fruit ; then put in the peaches, 
a few at a time, to scald. When they are boiled tender, so 
that they can be pierced with a broom-whisp, skim them out 
and lay on a platter. When all are scalded (taking care not 
to cook them too much), make a syrup as follows : Take 
one half the weight of peaches in sugar. Allow i gill, of 
the first syrup to every pound of fresh sugar. Put it into 
the kettle and bring it slowly to a boil. It will take some 
time for the sugar to dissolve. It must boil up rapidly once, 
then be stood aside to settle. Skim then, not before. 
Then bring to a boil again. Put the peaches into this 
strong syrup, a few at a time. Scald for about S minutes ; 
remove to jars. When all the peaches are cooked, boil 
down the syrup for 10 to 20 minutes, until very thick, 
taking care not to scorch it. Skim again. Drain the syrup 
from the jars. Fill the jars \ with the rich syrup. Fill to 
the top with the best 4th-proof French brandy. Cover and 
set away. Much care and taste must be used in handling 
and packing the fruit in jars. If liked, crack the stones and 
put 6 peeled kernels to each pint-jar. 

N. B. — To peel the kernels, throw boiling water over, and 
stand 5 or 10 minutes, when the skins will come off easily. 



PRESERVED WATERMELON-RIND. go; 

PRESERVED WATERMELON-RIND. 

8 pounds of rind, when cut up, 6 pounds of sugar, 

6 gills of water, including that in 3 or four ounces of ginger, according 
which the lemons are boiled, ' to taste for same, 

5 lemons (large). 

Peel the rind, removing also the pink part of a watermelon 
that is not fully ripe. Cut into pieces about i inch square. 
Cover with cold water, adding a little salt. Next day throw 
off that water. Cover with fresh water, adding this time a 
pinch of alum. Next morning rinse it well until all the 
alum is thoroughly washed off, and let it stand covered with 
cold water until you are ready to use it. Slice the lemons ; 
remove the seeds ; cover with boiling water, and boil until 
thoroughly tender, which will take fully 30 minutes. Scrape 
and slice very thin 3 ounces of green ginger. Put it down 
to boil in a saucepan, and boil until tender, which may per- 
haps take 2 hours (or less), according to the toughness of 
the root. But it must be tender before using. Weigh the 
watermelon-rind and allow about f of a pound of sugar to 
each pound of rind. Put the sugar by itself in the preserv- 
ing kettle, adding i gill of boiling water to each pound of 
sugar. Let it gradually dissolve and come to a gentle boil. 
Meanwhile put the watermelon-rind into boiling water in 
another vessel, and boil (covered) until tender, which will 
take from 30 to 45 minutes. When it looks evenly trans- 
parent, remove it from the fire ; drain off all the water ; 
wring it in a towel to squeeze out all moisture ; then lay 
the pieces on a platter to cool. They will look very dis- 
couraging and limp, but that is right. Now to return to the 
syrup. The water io which the lemon has been boiled 
should be used to wet the sugar, as far as it will, then 
plain boiling water added to make up the quantity required. 
Now bring the kettle forward and let the syrup come to a 
rapid boil, which it has to do before it will become crystal- 
clear. When it has bubbled and frothed up well, push it to 
the side of the range where it will subside again, then skim 
it thoroughly ; skimming before this point is waste of time 



So8 GOOD LIVING. 

and sugar. When well-skimmed (our best Havemeyer & 
Elder or Moller brands require hardly any skimming), put 
into the syrup the watermelon, the sliced lemon, and the 
ginger, if it is yet tender. You can also add a little of 
the water in which the ginger has been boiled, if it is very 
pungent and strong. It will improve the flavor decidedly. 
Boil until the rind has filled out again thoroughly, and looks 
rich and transparent ; then skim out the fruit into jars or 
tumblers ; boil down the syrup for 15 or 20 minutes ; pour 
the syrup over the fruit generously, and your preserved 
watermelon-rind is completed. It keeps admirably, and, 
though complicated, is not really troublesome. Citrons and 
drumheads may be treated as above. 

PRESERVED PLUMS. 

Make a Syrup for Preserves, as directed. When boiling 
again, after being well skimmed, drop in, a few at a time, 
plums which you have previously pricked with a coarse 
needle. Half of the stem may be left on, but this is not rec- 
ommended. Boil the fruit very gently in the syrup for 20 
minutes or more, until thoroughly soaked through. Then 
remove the fruit with a skimmer. Pack it in jars, |-full. 
Boil down the syrup 20 minutes or more until quite thick ; 
fill the jars to the top and set away to cool. Next day finish 
as directed for Peaches Preserved in Syrup. 

CHERRIES PRESERVED IN SYRUP. 

Prepare a Syrup for Preserves, as directed. 

Cut ^ the stem off of the cherries. Proceed as above 
directed for plums ; boiling perhaps a few minutes less, say 
15 instead of 20 minutes. Finish as directed for Peaches 
Preserved in Syrup. 

PEACH SWEETMEATS. 

Allow I pound of granulated sugar to i pound of fruit, 6 
kernels to every pint jar. 



BLACKBERRY SWEETMEATS. 509 

Weigh the fruit ; pare, and cut in \. Put it into the kettle 
and stand on one side. When the juice begins to run, add 
the sugar ; when it dissolves, bring the kettle forward and 
let it boil until the peaches are thoroughly tender, as much 
cooked as they can be without going to pieces. Skim the 
fruit out. Drain. Fill the jars. Let the syrup boil quickly 
for 20 minutes, taking care that it does not scorch. Draw 
to one side and skim ; then fill the jars. Cool ; cover ; wash, 
and set away. These are very simple and keep well. 

577?^ WBERRY SWEETMEATS. 

2 pounds of granulated sugar, 2 heaping pints of very large berries, 
2 gills of boiling water. 

Put the sugar in a china-lined preserving kettle with the 
water; stand it on one side of the range until the sugar is dis- 
solved ; then draw it forward, and, when boiling, put in the 
fruit. Boil about 10 minutes or more until the fruit is clear ; 
boil very gently, or the berries will break. Put them in 
tumblers or jars while the syrup boils down about 20 min- 
utes, or more, according to the wateriness of the fruit. The 
syrup must be rich and thick. Draw aside and let it settle ; 
then skim. Boil up once more and pour over the fruit, hav- 
ing first drained from it the thin syrup ; cover. If any syrup 
remains over, add to it enough vinegar to flavor ; boil up ; 
bottle and cork. It will make a refreshing drink after the 
style of Raspberry Vinegar. Great care must be taken to 
keep the berries not only whole but round, therefore while 
the jars are cooling, screw the covers on tightly ; turn the 
iars from side to side, to prevent settling flat. 

BLA C KB ERR Y S WEE TMEA TS. 

Allow I pound of granulated sugar to i pound of fruit. 
Choose by preference the Lawtons for this purpose. Put the 
fruit into a porcelain-lined kettle and set on a very moderate 
fire until enough juice is drawn out to prevent scorching. 
Boil until perfectly tender, fo or 15 minutes at least; then 



5IO GOOD-LIVING. 

add the sugar ; mix very carefully, not to bruise the fruit. Do 
not boil again. Just as soon as the sugar is thoroughly dis- 
solved, fill the jars as quickly as possible. Cover immediately. 
For Blackberry Jam, stir the fruit constantly and boil hard 
for 20 minutes, allowing f of a pound of sugar to i pound of 
fruit. 

CURRANT SWEETMEATS. 

Allow I pound of sugar to i pound of fruit. 

Pick over the fruit carefully, removing stems, leaves, etc. 
Weigh the fruit. Put it into a china^lined kettle and warm 
slowly. Stew gently from 20 to 30 minutes. Then add the 
sugar. Mix it through the fruit very carefully ; do not mash 
it. Do not boil again. Just as soon as the sugar is perfectly 
dissolved, fill the jars quickly ; cover cold, and set away. 
White currants and black may also be used as above. 

CHERR Y S WEE TMEA TS. 

May be prepared as above, as, indeed, may nearly all 
small fruits. 

GRAPE SWEETMEATS. 

Allow f of a pound of sugar to i pound of fruit. 

Select, by preference, Isabellas, or some good, out-door, 
black grape. Weigh the fruit. With your fingers, squeeze 
the pulp from the skin of each grape, throwing the pulps 
into one bowl, the skins into another. This is tailed 
" popping " (not the question, but) the grapes. When done, 
put the pulp into a porcelain-lined kettle on the fire. Heat 
gradually, and then stew gently for about 1 5 minutes until, 
by testing, you will find that the seeds come out easily. 
Turn them into a coarse sieve and press all the juice and 
pulp through, leaving behind only the seeds. Now put pulp 
and skins back on the fire in the same kettle, and, when boil- 
ing, add tlie sugar, and continue to boil for about 30 minutes ; 
it should, by this time, be a rich dark color, and quite thick ; 
if not, boil 1 5 minutes longer. Put into jars or glasses ; when 
pold, screw on the covers, wash, and set away. 



CVRRANT JELL Y. 5 1 1 

GRAPE JELLY. 

Proceed exactly as above, up to the point where the sugar 
is to be added. When the pulps and skins have boiled 
together 15 minutes, dip out some of the juice (it need not 
be strained), but no skins. To every pint of juice, allow i 
pound of sugar. Bring the juice to a rapid boil for 10 min- 
utes ; then add the sugar, and, when thoroughly dissolved, 
put into glasses. When cold, cover. This jelly is never as 
clear or as firm as Currant Jelly, but is very good, and serves 
as a useful substitute for the latter in many cases. It is well 
to make the jelly at the same time as the preserves, as it 
saves trouble and time. It is useless to strain the above, as 
it is never transparent under any circumstances. 

CURRANT JELLY., 

" The following receipt has three advantages : first, it 
never fails ; secondly, it requires but half the usual quantity of 
sugar ; thirdly, it is far less trouble than the usual method." 
With such a recommendation from its author, it is felt safe 
to give the receipt. 

Weigh the currants without removing the stems. Do not 
wash them, but carefully remove all leaves and twigs that 
may adhere to them. To each pound of fruit, allow \ the 
weight in granulated sugar. Put a few currants into a 
porcelain-lined preserve-kettle. Mash them to provide juice 
enough to prevent scorching. Then add the rest of the 
fruit; heat gradually; then boil briskly for 20 minutes, 
stirring occasionally to prevent scorching. Then transfer to 
a close, strong jelly-bag, letting the liquid run into earthen 
of wooden vessels, never into tin, the acid of the fruit acting 
on the tin, affecting both color and flavor. When strained, 
return the juice to the kettle, without measuring. Bring it 
to a boil. Let it boil hard for a minute or 2, then add the 
sugar. The very instant the sugar is entirely dissolved, the 
jelly is ready, and must immediately be put into glasses. It 
will jelly in the cup as it is being taken up. — Mrs. Henderson 
in " Practical Cooking and Dinner-Giving" 



SI2 GOOD.LIVING. 

Gather the currants for jelly as soon as ripe; they will not 
jelly as well if allowed to get too ripe, as the pulp softens. 
Never gather fruit for jelly or preserves while wet with rain, 
or immediately after a rain. They must be entirely free 
from dampness, as well as from moisture. The first week in 
July, in these latitudes, is generally the best (and hottest ! ) 
time for making currant jelly. The above receipt may also 
be followed for Raspberry and Currant Jelly, using the fruits 
in equal quantities, or \ currants to \ raspberries. It is 
much more delicate and delicious than that made from 
currants alone. 

PEACH MARMALADE. 

To every pound of fruit, allow f of a pound of sugar. 

Peel the peaches, and cut in small pieces, having previously 
weighed them. Put the fruit and sugar into a porcelain- 
lined preserving-kettle. Stir frequently to prevent scorching. 
Set the kettle where it will simmer steadily and gently. Let 
it cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 hours, until boiled 
down to thick marmalade. Crack and skin a handful of 
kernels, and add to the kettle. The marmalade will be 
ready to remove front the fire in 4^ to 5 hours, according to 
the heat of the fire. Skim. Put in glasses or jam-pots. It 
will keep for a long time, and is a most satisfactory preserve, 
giving very little trouble. 

N. B. — Do not boil it until it is dark brown, as is often 
done, nor until as thick as paste ; it will become thicker as 
well as darker when put away. 

PINE-APPLE MARMALADE. 

Allow I pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. 

Weigh the fruit ; then peely take out the eyes, and grate the 
pine-apples coarsely. Put them, pulp and sugar, in a china- 
lined preserve-kettle on the fire. Heat gradually. Stir 
often. Cook very gently, but steadily, until clear and thick, 
which may require perhaps as much as 3 to 3J hours. Put 
into tumblers, and, when cold, cover. 



MOLASSES CANDY. 513 

TO KEEP PIE-PLANT. 

Wash out preserve jars, and fill them with cold water. Cut 
the rhubarb, or pie-plant, into lengths of 2 inches. Peel or 
not, as you prefer. Throw the rhubarb into the jars. As 
they fill, the water will overflow. When full, screw the tops 
on the jars and set away. The water excludes the air, and 
the fruit, treated in this way, will keep for months. When 
required for use, drain off the water, and cook according to 
any of the usual modes. 

JAMBOREE. 

"jyi pints of grape juice, Ground cinnamon, 
iji pounds of pears, peeled and cut fine, " allspice, 

i}i " " apples, " " " " " cloves, 

12 pounds sugar. 

Prepare the grapes as for Grape Jelly (see receipt), allowing 
J pound of sugar to every pint of juice. When it has boiled 
rapidly for 20 minutes, put this syrup into a large kettle with 
the pears, apples, and sugar, allowing ^ a pound of sugar to 
I pound of pears and apples. Bring to a boil ; then set aside 
where it will simmer gently, but without interruption. Stir 
very often, and mash the fruit as smooth as possible. After 
4 hours and 30 minutes, add ground spices, as above, |Using 
very little cloves. Mix well. Continue to boil for about 6 
hours in all. Then, if like thick batter, put into jars. When 
cold (after i or 2 day*), cover. The jamboree should be 
almost of the consistency of apple-butter. 

MOLASSES CANDY. 

t Qup of New Orleans molasses, i cup of brown sugar, 

I tablespoon cf vinegar, I ounce of melted butter. 

Mix and boil together, without stirring, for about 25 min- 
utes, until it harden.s when a little is dropped into cold' 
water. Add i level teaspoonful of baking-soda, and stir only 
just enough to mix. Pour immediately into shallow, well-

the hands, during the process, in ice-water or in melted 
butter. 

PEA-NUT CANDY. 

Remove shells and skins from the nuts; almost fill the 
greased pans with them ; pour over them the hot Molasses 
Candy (see above) when sufficiently boiled, and set away in a 
cool place to harden. 

PECAN.NUT CANDY. 

4 pounds of brown sugar, i pound of butter, 

I quart of kernels, ^ pint of boiling water. 

Put the sugar in a saucepan with the boiling water. Boil 
hard for 20 minutes. Add the butter. Boil 5 minutes. Stir 
hard. Add the nuts. When it comes again to a boil, pour 
it into small buttered tins or saucers, and set away to harden. 

BLACK-WALNUT CANDY. 
Make exactly according to above receipt. 

CARAMELS,. 

1 cup of molasses, I cup of brown sugar, 

2 cups " grated chocolate, i " " white " 
2 " " cream (sweet), Vanilla to taste, 

I teaspoon of flour. 

Mix together to a smooth paste the flour, chocolate, and 
some of the cream. Boil 30 minutes, with the sugars, cream, 
and flavoring. Pour into greased, flat pans, and when almost 
cold, mark in squares with a knife. 



PICKLES, CATSUPS, ETC. 

Note. — Nearly all pickles are much improved by being 
allowed to stand some time before being used. 

GREEN TOMATO SOY. 

2 gallons sliced green tomatoes, 2 tablespoons of salt, 

12 large onions, sliced, 2 " " ground mustard, 

12 green peppers, " 2 " " black pepper, 

2 quarts best cider vinegar, i tablespoon of allspice, 

I quart brown sugar, I " " cloves. 

Stew all together until tender, stirring often to prevent 
burning. They will require about 5 hours' slow boiling. 
Put up in small glass jars, letting the vinegar cover the 
pickles well. The pickle should be allowed to stand some 
time before using. 

GREEN TO MA TO PICKLES. 

1 cup of salt, I tablespoon of ground mustard seed. 

2 pounds of brown sugar, ^ teaspoon of red pepper, or pods in 
I gallon of best cider vinegar, strips, 

I tablespoon of white mustard seed, 2 quarts of boiling water,

6 large onions (white), chopped fine. 

Sprinkle the tomatoes and onions with salt and stand over- 
night. Next day, drain. Boil 15 minutes in 2 quarts of 
boiling water and i quart of vinegar. Drain again. Pre- 
pare the pickle with the rest of the vinegar and spices ; add 
the tomatoes and onions to it. Boil 2 hours, stirring fre- 
quently to prevent scorching. Put into jars while hot. Let 
the vinegar cover the pickle well. Close and set away.

BLACK PICKLE. 

I peck of green tomatoes, sliced, i ounce ground cloves. 

Handful of salt, I " " ginger, 

1 pint brown sugar, i " " pepper, 

1 gallon best vinegar, I " " allspice, 

2 ounces dry mustard. 

t 

Throw the salt over the sliced tomatoes ; let them stand 
overnight. In the morning, squeeze out the salt, and put 
the tomatoes in the kettle. Mix the spices, etc., together in 
a bowl. Sprinkle them over the tomatoes. Add the vine- 
gar, and let all boil slowly for 5 hours, stirring frequently to 
avoid burning. Put the pickles in jars. Let the vinegar 
cover the pickles well. Cork and seal the jars. It will keep 
for years (if allowed to). 

This is an old-fashioned receipt, and is worthy of being 
perpetuated. 

CELERY PICKLE. 

% pound white mustard seed, 2 tablespoons of salt, 

2 quarts of chopped white cabbage, 4 or 5 tablespoons of sugar, 

2 " " " celery, JS^ ounce white ginger-root (crushed 

3 " " vinegar, b^st, in a mortar), 

\i ounce turmeric. 

Boil all together, in a porcelain-lined kettle, slowly for 4 or 

5 hours (no longer), until the cabbage and celery are perfectly 

tender. Put into jars. Let the vinegar cover the pickle 

well ; cork tightly. Do not let the pickle boil hard at any 

time. 

PEPPER PICKLE. 

25 green peppers. Vinegar to cover, 

Double their bulk in cabbage, i tablespoon of mustard seed, 

2 gills of salt, I " " ground cloves, 

I tablespoon of ground allspice. 

Remove the seeds from the peppers and chop the fruit. 
Chop the cabbage. Add all the other ingredients ; cover 
with cold vinegar. Put in jars, being careful that the vine- 
gar covers the pickles. Cork tightly. 

Use a napkin or cotton gloves to prepar? the pepperS; of 
they will burn your hands. 



INDIAN PICKLE. 517 

PICKLED NASTURTIUMS. 

Have jars partly filled with salted vinegar ; as the nastur. 
tiums are gathered, wash and dry them and throw them into 
the vinegar, always being careful that the vinegar covers the 
nasturtiums. 

INDIAN PICKLE. 

I white cabbage, 12 shallots, 

Cauliflower, a sticks sliced horse-radish. 

Radish-pods, ^ pound of ginger-root. 

String-beans, 2 ounces whole black pepper, 

Gherkins, 1 ounce whole allspice. 

Small white onions, 12 cloves, 

Nasturtiums, X ounce cayenne, 

Peppers, etc. , 2 ounces mustard-seed, 

I gallon of vinegar, X pound ground mustard, 

6 cloves of garlic, i ounce turmeric. 

Slice a firm, white cabbage ; divide the flowerets of the 
cauliflowers ; sprinkle salt over them in a large dish, or 
wooden tub, and set aside for 48 hours ; then dry and put 
them into a large jar, with the garlic and other seasonings 
in the above proportions. Boil the vinegar and pour over 
them ; the vinegar should cover the vegetables well. When 
cold, cover the jar. 

As the other vegetables ripen in season, they may be 
added to the jar. They must first be Washed in cold 
vinegar, wiped, and then simply added to the other ingredi- 
ents in the jar, only taking care that they are covered hy the 
vinegar. If more vinegar should be required, do not fail to 
boil it before adding to the rest. When all the vegetables 
are collected, turn the contents of the jar into a large bowl ; 
mix thoroughly. Pack the vegetables in smaller jars with- 
out the vinegar. Boil the vinegar again, adding to it as 
much more as may be required to fill the jars, and adding 
to this cold fresh vinegar more of the same seasonings in the 
above proportions. Bring to a boil, and, while boiling, pour 
over the pickle. When cold, cover. This keeps well, if 
entirely covered with vinegar. 



5l8 GOOD-LIVING. 

PICKLED ONIONS. 
To I quart of vinegar allow : 

2 tablespoons whole allspice, 2 tablespoons whole black pepper. 

The onions should be of the smallest, white, ripe, and dry. 
Remove the first skin with the fingers ; the second skin with 
a silver knife ; (steel spoils the color of the onions). Pack 
in well-washed and dried bottles or jars. Pour over the 
onions sufficient cold vinegar to cover, seasoned with pepper 
and allspice in the above proportions. Be careful that the 
vinegar covers the onions well. Cover and tie down tightly, 
to exclude the air. In a fortnight the onions will be ready 
for use. The above receipt is simple, and the onions nice 
and crisp. They should, however, not be kept more than 
6 or 8 months, or they may soften. Mason's Latest Improved 
Jars are recommended for this purpose. 

PICKLE HASH. 

]^ medium-sized cabbage, i large or 2 small Spanish onions, 

4 large heads of celery, 2 cucumbers, 

4 tablespoons of grated horse-radish, i red and i green pepper, 

6 large green tomatoes, Best cider vinegar. 

Chop all and mix together. Put a layer 2 inches deep in 
a crock ; sprinkle with i tablespoonful of salt ; then put 
another layer of vegetables and salt, and so on until all are 
used. Let stand 24 hours. Drain. Press out all liquid. 
Cover with boiling water. Let stand 10 minutes, then press 
out all moisture with the hands. Bring the vinegar to a 
boil. To every quart of vinegar, add \ teaspoonful of pow- 
dered alum, and dissolve. Put the vegetables in the jar 2 
inches deep ; sprinkle with mustard-seed, black pepper, and 
horse-radish ; another layer of vegetables, another of spices, 
and so on. Pour over this the boiling vinegar. Let it cover 
the pickle well. Cover tightly. Let stand a few days. 
Keeps well.

PICKLED GHERKINS OR SMALL CUCUMBERS. 

Sc^ld with brine and set aside in the brine 24 hours. 
Drain dry and wipe. Put in jars. Throw over them well- 
spiced boiling vinegar (see receipt for Green Tomato Pickles). 
Let stand 2 weeks or longer before using. The vinegar must 
cover the pickles well. 

PICKLED STRING-BEANS. 

Lay young, tender beans in strong brine overnight. 
Drain and dry. Fill jars with them. Cover with hot, spiced 
vinegar (see Green Tomato Pickles), with \ teaspoonful of 
powdered alum to i quart of vinegar. Let the vinegar 
cover the pickles well. Cork, and set away for 6 weeks at 
least.

GREEN TO MA TO SWEET PICKLE. 

Pare 2 pounds of firm green tomatoes. Boil them in ^ot 
vinegar and water (^ of each) for 30 minutes. Make a syrup 
of I pint of strong vinegar and \\ pounds of brown sugar 
for every 2 pounds of the tomatoes. Spice to taste with

PEPPER VINEGAR. 
Fill a small bottle |~full of very small cherry peppers ol 
chillies ; fill it up with best wine or cider vinegar. Will be 
ready for use in a few days. The older it grows, the stronger 
and better it is. The bottle may be filled up with vinegar

BEVERAGES, ETC. 
DRIP-COFFEE FOR BREAKFAST. 

CKY± AU LAIT. 

Use for this the French coffee biggin. See that the 
strainers are all in place and the coffee-pot absolutely clean. 
This is a more important point than is generally imagined. 
Tin coffee-pots require more than ordinary care, for the rea- 
son that the chemical action of the coffee upon the tin 
creates a bluish substance which collects and clings to every 
crevice and seam, and, in the course of time, affects the 
flavor of the coffee most peculiarly and unpleasantly. Use, 
therefore, in preference, a coffee-pot made 'on the system of 
the biggin, but in earthenware instead of tin. They are im- 
ported to New York, and are not expensive, their only dis- 
advantage being the fact that they are breakable. Having 
the strainers all ready and in order, and the coffee ground 
just fine enough not to pass through the second strainer, 
put it into the biggin, allowing i heaping tablespoonful of 
ground coffee for each cup, and one for the coffee-pot. 
Place the top strainer in position. Set on the corner of the 
range and pour in the measured quantity of water required, 
which should be freshly boiled. Cover. Let it trickle 
through ; then pour the coffee into a cup and back over the 
grounds once or more, according to the degree of strength 
required. Keep the coffee-pot where it will be just short of 
boiling, and be sure the spout and top are well covered 
while the coffee is dripping. Serve immediately with bojled 
milk.

TO MAKE GOOn TEA. §23 

AFTER-DINNER DRIP-COFFEE. 
caf£ noir. 

Make exactly the same as Drip-Coffee for Breakfast, 
allowing \ the usual quantity of boiling water to the amount 
of coffee indicated. Serve at the same time a small pitcher 
of very sweet cream. If the cream is not fresh as well as 
sweet, the heat of the coffee will curdle it. 

BOILED COFFEE. 

Allow the same proportions as for Drip-Coffee that is, I 
heaping tablespoon of ground coffee to each cup, and i for 
the pot. Mix with the raw grounds the white of I egg to 
about 5 cups of coffee, and \ cup of cold water. Crush the 
shell of the egg and throw it into the coffee-pot. Put in the 
coffee and white of egg, then pour on freshly-boiled water to 
the amount required ; close lid and spout tightly. Let it 
boil for about 3 minutes hard, then throw in about a wine- 
glassful of cold water to settle it ; draw it a little aside, 
where it will keep very hot but not boil, and let stand 10 
or 1 5 minutes ; serve then, immediately, with boiled milk. 
Breakfast coffee with cream need not be quite as strong as 
that drunk with milk, as the latter serves to dilute it more. 
In making coffee (especially boiled coffee) be sure that the 
spout is tightly closed, as well as the lid, to keep in the 
aroma. There are many varieties of coffee-pots, each having 
with it the directions for its special use. The above receipt 
is for a plain coffee-pot. 

TO MAKE GOOD TEA. 

Put the tea-kettle on the fire, filled with fresh, cold water, 
and bring it to a boil. Select a tea-pot of an appropriate 
size for the quantity of tea you wish to make ; that is, for a 
few cups do not use a large tea-pot. As soon as the water 
comes to a boil, pour some of it into the tea-pot and let it stand 
on the corner of the range for i or 2 minutes, until it is 



524 GOOD-LIVING. 

thoroughly heated. Throw out this water ; leave the covet 
open ; stand again on the range until dry, only a few minutes. 
Now put in the tea, allowing i teaspoonful for each person 
and I for the pot. Close the lid and leave the tea-pot upon 
the range i minute, or perhaps 2, until the tea-leaves are 
heated through. Now pour on at the one time all the water 
you will require. Close the lid and stand in a hot corner 
3 to 5 minutes, then serve it immediately. 

For teas, where the one tea-pot has to serve an unknown 
number of guests, it should be replenished from the boiling 
kettle after each cup that is taken from it. The tea-pot, if 
of moderate size, should be \ filled with leaves, and then it 
need not stand to draw, if kept constantly replenished from 
the boiling kettle after each cup. When it begins to look 
weaker than it should, have the leaves thrown out and fresh 
tea made as' before. 

RUSSIAN TEA. 

Make the Tea as directed. Serve it in glasses with sugar 
to taste and a slice of lemon in each glass. 

ICED TEA. 

Make the Tea as directed. Put it in the ice-box. When 
ready to serve, ^fill a glass pitcher with ice ; put in a sliced 
lemon ; sweeten the tea, and pour it over the ice. Stir until 
very cold, and serve. The tea should not be as strong as for 
drinking hot. 

CHOCOLA TE. 

CHOCOLAT. 

I ounce of grated chocolate, ^ pint of new milk, 

3 tablespoons of whipped cream. 

These are the proportions for i cup. Melt the chocolate 
in a farina-kettle with i or 2 tablespoonfuls of the cold milk. 
Bring the rest of the milk to a boil. When the chocolate is 
melted, stir in the boiling milk, add sugar to taste, cover, 



EGG AND WINE. 52$ 

and boil S minutes over boiling water. Remove ; be3.t with 
a Dover egg-beater until light and smooth. Serve with the 
whipped cream heaped upon the chocolate in the cup. 

COCOA, BROMA, RACAHOtfT. 
These all have the directions for making printed on the 
package. 

ICED COCOA AS A SUMMER DRINK. 

This is very wholesome and innocuous. Follow directions 
for the proportions given on the package, using \ of the 
Kquid allowed, and that water. When made and well- 
sweetened, put it away on the ice. Put cracked ice in a 
tumbler ; put \ of cold cocoa, fill with ice-cold milk. Or, 
have the cocoa made in the proportion of \ of the liquid 
allowed ; sweeten, cool it, and use with 3 parts of soda-water. 
It is nourishing cis well as refreshing. 

EGG-NOGG. 

3 gills of rum, I pound powdered sugar, scant, 

I gill of brandy, I nutmeg, grated, 

I quart of cream, i teaspoon of ground mace, 

10 eggs, beaten, whites and yolks apart. 

Beat the yolks to a cream ; add to them the other ingredi- 
ents ; adding the whites, beaten to a stiff froth, just before 
the cream. If bottled and put in a cold place, will keep 3 or 
4 days, but must be shaken before being used. Recom- 
mended. 

EGG AND WINE. 

Break the white of i egg upon a plate, the yolk into a 
tumbler. Beat the yolk to a cream with a small teaspoonful 
of powdered sugar ; add one teaspoon of sherry wine or \ 
the quantity of brandy or rum. Beat the white to a stiff 
froth ; then beat this into the yolk until evenly and thor- 
oughly mixed. A little chopped ice may be beaten with the 
yolk of egg. Grate a little nutmeg over the top and serve 
very cold. This is excellent for delicate people and in- 
valids.

This improves with age. German apothecaries sell this oil. 
Recommended. 




COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 

BEEF-JUICE. 

Select a piece of lean, freshly-killed beef, cut about \ of an 
inch thick. Broil it over red-hot coals for about 2 nainutes 
on each side, no longer. Stand a cup in a bowl of boiling 
water, and squeeze the beef-juice into the cup with a patent 
beef- or lemon-squeezer. Add a pinch of salt and keep the 
cup standing in the hot water until required for use. Noth- 
ing is more distasteful to a delicate appetite than half-cold, 
half-cooked beef-juice. If made as above, it will have the 
nutty flavor of the seared meat, and need not be at all 
unpalatable. 

PLAIN BEEF-TEA. 

I pound of lean, fresh-killed beef, i pint of cold water, 

2 even teaspoons of salt. 

Cut the beef in very small dice, or, better still, have the 
butcher criss-cross or hackle it with a sharp butcher's knife. 
Cover it with the cold water ; add salt ; soak i hour. Put 
the bowl or cup in a saucepan of boiling water, and let it 
heat over the fire until it nearly reaches boiling-point. On 
no account allow it to boil. Strain the pieces of meat out 
through a rather coarse strainer, and serve immediately with 
a small bit of toast. 

DELICIOUS BEEF-TEA. 

Prepare the beef as in preceding receipt. Put it into a 
perfectly clean bottle. Add a little salt, a sprig of parsley, 
and I or 2 fresh celery-leaves. Add the water, i pint, cold, 

52Q 



530 GOOD-LIVING. 

Cork tightly ; put the bottle into a pot of lukewarm water 
and let it come gradually to a boil. Boil 3 or 4 hours. It 
may be used after 2 hours, but is even better if cooked longer. 
Uncork ; strain and serve with toast. This is acceptable to 
many invalids who do not like ordinary beef-tea. 

FLOUR-BALL FOR INFANTS' FOOD. 
Tie I pint of flour as closely as possible in a strong cotton 
cloth. Put it into a pot of boiling water and boil 4 hours. 
Be sure it is well-covered with water. The pot should be 
covered. Then take the ball out and set aside to cool. To 
use it, scrape a little of the ball ; mix with cold water or 
milk; stir into boiling milk; season with a pinch of salt; 
make thicker or thinner as may be required. The flour-ball 
will keep in a cool, dry place for weeks. 

KUMYSS. 

1 quart of new milk, I tablespoon of brewer's yeast, 

2 tablespoons of Trommer Malt Extract. 

I 

Mix and set by the range at a temperature of 90° Fahr. 
until it begins to work, then pour it off into self-sealing 
beer-bottles and set in a cool place. Recommended. 

PARCHED RICE. 

Roast the rice until of a rich, even brown. Throw into 
salted boiling water and boil until perfectly tender. Do not 
stir if it can be avoided. Drain. Serve with sugar. 

RICE-WATER. 
Proceed as above, boiling the rice a little longer. Strain 
out the grains, and use the water. 

TOAST-WATER. 
Cut slices of stale bread ; toast over a slow fire until very 
dry and evenly brown, not burned. Put into a pitcher; 
cover with boiling water. Infuse for i or 2 hours ; strain 
the water and use.

CHICKEN CONSOMM&. 

CHICKEN JELL V. 



ARROW-ROOT BLANC-MANGE. 

I cup of boiling water, 2 heaping teaspoons of arrow-root, 

Sugar, sherry wine, and nutmeg. 

When the water boils^ blend the arrow-root with a very 
little cold water ; pour it into the boiling water ; stir steadily 
until it becomes thick and transparent. Remove from the 
fire ; then stir in sugar to taste. Add 2 or 3 teaspoonfuls of 
sherry; mix; pour into a tumbler; grate a little nutmeg 
over the top, and set away to cool. It will become firmer as 
it cools, but should never be hard. Excellent. 

INDIAN-MEAL GRUEL. 

Blend 2 tablespoonfuls of Indian meal with a little cold 
water. Have ready boiling i quart of well-salted water. 
Stir in the meal. Stir for a few minutes, then set where it 
will boil gently for 4 hours. Stir occasionally. Do not 
cover the pot. Serve with a little cream added. Or, blend 
I teaspoonful of flour with a little cold water ; stir it into 
the boiling gruel ; boil 3 minutes, stirring constantly, and 
serve. 






STRAY NOTES. 

CHOPPING MACHINE. 

Much time is saved and excellent results are obtained by 
the use of the " Enterprise Chopper." Number lo is small, 
but serviceable ; No, 3 is an excellent size for general utility. 
It is a most efficient aid in making croquettes, p&t^s, meat- 
loaves, etc. 

VEGETABLE PRESS. 

For making purees of all kinds there is an excellent, small 
hand-press manufactured by the Silver Co. It is not only an 
-economy of labor and time, but also of sieves, as the usual 
mode of pressing the purde through a coarse sieve wears out 
the latter very rapidly. 

EGG.BEA TERS. 

The best and most reliable egg-beater is either the 
" Dover " or one which is made of a bunch of wires fastened 
together by a wire handle. 

ICE-CREAM FREEZER. 

The White Mountain Freezer is recommended as being 
about the most practical at the present time. 

FR YING-BA SKE T. 

This is an indispensable article where well-fried croquettes, 
etc., are desired. Being of very moderate cost, no kitchen 
should be without one. These baskets are made of fine 
wire woven in large meshes. 

533 



STRAY NOTES. S33 

SHEETS OF TIN OR IRON. 

Have at hand 2 or 3 sheets of iron or tin, 12 x 14 or 16 
inches, for baking drop-cakes and all such things as might be 
disfigured by being lifted over the rim of a baking-pan. 
They will be found very useful. 

PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

Use for putting up pickles and preserves the " Mason's 
Latest Improved " jars, with wide mouths. They are the 
best made, the cover being in one piece and so arranged that 
no metal comes in contact with the contents of the jars. 

TO TRUSS SMALL BIRDS. 

Use small wooden toothpicks for skewering small birds. 
Do not remove them before serving, as they help to give a 
trim appearance to the birds. 

PLANKED SHAD. 

For planked shad use a thick, handsome oak-board. At- 
tach the shad with white tacks or wooden pegs. When ready 
to serve, remove the tacks or pegs and serve on the oak 
plank. 

TO OPEN CLAMS WITHOUT A KNIFE. 

Wash the shells ; stand them on the hinge-end in a bake- 
pan. Put a few spoonfuls of boiling water in the pan ; set 
the pan in the oven until the shells part, when they may be 
easily opened and cooked as required. 

TO SELECT OYSTERS. 

Choose by preference for eating raw on the half-shell, very 
small Blue Points. For cooking, especially for frying, the 
best are the Shrewst)urys and Saddle Rocks. 



534 GOOD-LIVING. 

TO SELECT LOBSTERS. 

If possible, never buy a lobster that is already boiled. If 
unavoidable, however, you may ascertain the condition of 
the lobster, when cooked, by pressing the tail outward. If 
it is elastic and, when released, flies back instantly to its first 
position, you may know that it was alive when put down to 
boil. The tail should be curled inward as an indication also 
of the same fact. 

VENISON. 

Venison is best when it has been frozen and partially 
thawed 2 or 3 times. In winter it will keep for 6 weeks, if 
hung in the open air. When cut into steaks and set in the 
ice-box, it will not keep any longer than other meats. 

ROAST TURKEY. 
For roasting, select by preference a young hen-turkey. 

SWEETBREADS. 

Always cook sweetbreads in a china-lined saucepan, and 
use a silver or plated knife to ctit them, as steel is considered 
to be injurious both to flavor and color. 

BEEF'S LIVER. 

Before cooking sliced beef's liver, always throw boiling 
water over it ; let it stand 5 minutes ; then wipe dry and 
proceed with the cooking. 

LARDING-PORK. 

Larding=pork should be thrown into ice-water before using 
to harden it. 

CALF'S HEAD. 

In preparing calf 's head for cooking, be most careful to 
cleanse not only the ears, but also scald out with boiling 
water the nose and throat passages. 



STRA Y NOTES. 535 

HAM BONE. 
When a ham is consumed, always use the bone to boil in 
pease soup. It is an excellent addition. 

COLD GAME AND MEA T. 
To keep overnight cooked game or meat that has been 
cut, so that it may remain moist and fresh, wrap it in con- 
fectioner's paper and place it in the ice-box. Cut cake may 
be kept in the same way. 

TO THAW FROZEN MEATS. 

The best way to thaw frozen meat, is to hang it in the 
kitchen overnight. If in a hurry to thaw poultry, the 
quickest way is to lay it in a pan with ice or ice-water ; but 
it is best to avoid this, if possible. 

TO PRESERVE TURKEYS AND CHICKENS. 

Joint them after cleaning; cut up as for fricassee. Put 
the pieces into a hot frying-pan with drippings or butter and 
let them sear on all sides. Then put them into an earthen- 
ware crock. Melt lard or clarified drippings ; pour into the 
crock until the chicken is quite covered. This seals the 
meat from the air when cold. In winter it will keep for 
weeks in a cool place, but do not allow it to freeze. When 
ready to use, take out what is required ; scrape off Jhe fat, 
and prepare according to taste, fricasseed, stewed, etc., etc. 
If any remains in the crock, seal it as before with hot lard 
and set away. 

TO KEEP SAUSAGES. 

Prick with a fork. Toss in a hot frying-pan until cooked 
on all sides ; put into a crock with lard, etc., and seal as 
above. 



PHEASANTS, PARTRIDGES, AND QUAIL. 

Always cover the breasts of these birds before cooking 
with thin slices of pork, unless larded ; they are naturally 



536 GOOD-LIVING. 

dry birds, and this greatly improves them. Do not use 
bacon for the purpose, as its flavor is so pronounced that it 
overpowers that of the bird. 

MEATS TO BE SERVED COLD. 

Tongue should be allowed t9 get cold first in the water in 
which it is boiled. If it is to be put away cold afterwards, it 
should be rolled in a clean, coarse cloth and set in the ice- 
box. Corn-beef should also be allowed to cool in the water 
in which it is boiled. A la Mode Beef or Daube should be 
put into a large bowl, covered with their own hot gravy, 
shut up tight, and set away. Chickens, stewed and fricasseed 
should be treated in the same way. Save all the gravy for 
the purpose. The usual mode of thrusting the meat into 
the ice-box, leaving it to dry out as it cools, is a mistake ; it 
makes the surfaces dry and juiceless, and, as a rule, most un- 
appetizing. When gravy is lacking, a little good broth may 
be used to pour over the meat or chicken before it is set 
away to cool, covered. 

TO MAKE TOUGH MEAT TENDER. 

Cut the steaks the day before they are required into 
slices about 2 inches thick. Rub the surfaces with a little 
baking-soda. Next morning, wash off the soda ; cut the 
meat into the shape and thickness desired, and cook it to 
taste. The same process may be used for poultry, mutton, 
etc. 

TO MAKE CHICKENS WHITE AND TENDER. 

The moment before they are to be killed, make them 
swallow I tablespoonful of best vinegar, then finish as 
usual. 

RULE FOR BOILING PEAS, ETC. 

Never put the lid on the pot while boiling spinach, peas, 
beans, or Brussels sprouts. By observing this rule, the vege- 
tables will be found to preservp their fresh green color. 



STRAY NOTES. 537 

TO POACH EGGS. 

Note that in poaching eggs, the water should not boil 
after the egg is put into it, as the jumping of the water in 
ebullition makes the edges ragged and untidy. The eggs 
should cook slowly and quietly. Be sure, however, that the 
water boils when the egg is put in. 

WATER OF BOILED POTATOES. 

The water in which potatoes are boiled with their skins on 
is said to be poisonous. It is said to be excellent for de- 
stroying green-fly on rose-bushes. 

OYSTER-PLANT. 

Never expose this to the air when once it is scraped. 
Throw it immediately into cold water. Cook in a china- 
lined saucepan, as iron also discolors it. 

TO PEEL ONIONS. 

Put the onions in a bowl of cold water. Peel them with a 
sharp knife under water. This saves tears. 

TO BOIL CAULIFLOWER. 

To prevent breaking the flower, tie it in a piece of clean 
cheese-cloth. When boiled, it can be raised out of the pot 
by the tied corners of the cloth without i;isk of injuring the 
beauty of the cauliflower. 

TO SOFTEN THE WATER FOR BOILING 
VEGETABLES. 

Use a pinch of bi-carbonate of soda for softening the water 
in which to boil beans, limas, asparagus tips, etc., only when 
the water is very hard, or the peas very old.

TO BOIL CABBAGE. 

Never boil cabbage with corn-beef ; it renders both un- 
wholesome. Boil apart, and serve together, if desired. 

TO BAKE SWEET POTATOES 

In such a way as to make them peel easily, after they 
have been well squeezed in a cloth several times during the 
process of baking, put them in a pan ; cover the pan with a 
damp cloth folded in 4 or 8 ; set back in the corner of the 
range and leave them 1 5 to 20 minutes. 

TO BOIL PEAS TENDER. 

Observe two things : first, have plenty of water in which 
they can play about ; second, do not cover them. 

TO FRESHEN SALT FISH. 

Lay in cold water, carefully turning the skin side upper- 
most. Otherwise the salt, in melting, will sink into the skin 
and the fish be as salt as ever. By putting the flesh side 
downward, the salt falls to the bottom of the dish. 

PEPPER. 

White pepper is recommended for general use in the 
kitchen in preference to black, as being less unwholesome 
and more palatable. The latter need only be used occa- 
sionally, as directed, and then in most cases, whole. 

TO SKIM SAUCE. 

To do this easily, draw the saucepan to the side of the 
range ;' pour in a very few drops of cold water. This causes 
the grease to rise, and it may be removed without trouble;

BREAD-CRUMBS. 

These are so valuable in the kitchen, and in such constant 
demand, that it is well to make every few days a supply to 
keep on hand. Put any pieces of stale bread there may be 
in a roasting-pan ; stand it in the open oven until perfectly 
dry, but not at all brown. Roll these out on a board with 
the rolling-pin. Sift them. The very finest, put into a 
separate jar for dipping oysters and croquettes ; others may 
be used for breading meats, baked dishes, etc. The stock of 
bread-crumbs should never be allowed to run out. Another 
excellent way to crumb the bread is to put it, when dried, 
into a coarse, clean cloth and beat it with a potato-masher. 
Sift as directed. 

CRUMBED HARD EGGS. 

These may be used as a variety to sift over sweetbreads or 
chicken, etc., " en caisses," instead of bread-crumbs. When 
the eggs are boiled hard, remove the whites and press the 
yolks through a coarse sieve with the potato-masher. 

DIPPING FOR FRYING. 

It is recommended by some authorities to dip certain arti- 
cles such as fish, first in breadcrumbs, then in egg, and again 
in crumbs. This process makes the dipping cling better. 
The French dip meat-cutlets and chops into crumbs only, if 
perfectly freshly cut ; or into melted butter and then into 
crumbs. For croquettes, where it is necessary sometimes to 
have a firmer covering, they may be dipped twice, always 
alternating, first in the egg, then the crumbs, allowing the 
croquettes to stand some time before the second dipping. 
It is recommended also by the above-mentioned authority, to 
mix a little melted butter with the yolk of egg where this 
latter is used for dipping. In all cases the most important 
point in successful frying, is that the lard be boiling. 



S40 GOOD-LIVING. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS. 

Dip in melted suet and pack with the smaller end down- 
ward in salt. Or, make a solution of i gallon of boiling water 
poured over i pound of unslacked lime ; cool thoroughly 
and pour over the eggs which have been packed, small end 
downwards, in jars. Do not use the sediment of the lime- 
water. Keep in a cool, dark place. The object is to stop 
up the pores of the eggs. 

TO CLARIFY DRIPPINGS. 

Select beef-suet for the purpose by preference, but any fat 
trimmings (excepting those of mutton and lamb) may also 
be tried out. Cut the suet into moderate-sized pieces. Put 
these into a crock with a little boiling water. Set the crock 
in a pot of boiling water, and put all in one corner of the 
range, where the suet will melt slowly. The fat may be 
poured off into a clean bowl as it melts, a little more boiling 
water being added. It should always be strained. Next 
day collect all the drippings together and put them as above 
over boiling water. When melted and brought to boiling 
point, strain into a crock and set away. Keep in a cold 
place and use for saut^ing, etc. All fat should be saved from 
soups, etc., and at least once a week be clarified as directed. 
This will be found to be a great economy of butter. 

TO CLEAN DRIED CURRANTS. 

To each quart of dried currants add i cup of flour ; rub 
them well between the hands. This will free them from 
stems, etc. Then turn into a colander and shake out the 
stems ; put them into a pan of cold water and wash thor- 
oughly with both hands. Drain in a colander, letting the 
water wash through them until all the remaining stems are 
carried ofl. Then spredd them on flat dishes in the mouth 
of the oven or other warm place ; leave until dry ; then use. 



STRAY NOTES. 54I 

TO STONE RAISINS. 

Throw them into a bowl of boiling water. As soon as 
they are cool enough to handle, stone them in the water and 
throw them into a bowl. 

ORANGE-PEEL FOR CAKES. 

When oranges are abundant, take the skins.' Boil i pound 
of these until perfectly tender ; chop them fine ; to i gill of 
the water in which the skins have boiled, add i pound of 
brown sugar and the skins ; boil all together until very thick, 
and put into a wide-mouthed jar to use for flavoring. 

YEAST. 
One cup of yeast is equal to i compressed yeast-cake. 

BREAD. 

A loaf when risen ready for the oven should be at least 
twice the size it was when first put in the bread-pan to rise. 

TO GREASE BREAD-PANS. 

Always grease bread- and cake-pans with lard, not with 
butter, as the latter blackens in long baking. When the 
loaves come out of the oven, stand them on end, not touch- 
ing each other, and cover with a very thin cloth. A thick 
cloth makes the crusts soft and soggy. It only requires suf- 
cient covering to keep off dust and flies. 

TO HEA T THE GRIDDLE FOR GRIDDLE CAKES. 

It should be put on the back of the range several hours 
before using, that it may heat slowly. When ready, bring 
it forward and let it become very hot indeed, but not 
scorching. 



542 GOOD-LIVING. 

TO CREASE THE GRIDDLE. 

Use a piece of fat pork on the end of a fork. Keep it for 
the purpose. 

TO REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE OF AN OVER- 
HEATED OVEN. 

Shut off all draughts and open the dampers. Set a bowl 
of ice-water inside of the door and close it. This will affect 
the temperature sensibly. Should it not suffice, however, 
open the range-cover directly over the oven, leaving a space 
of about I of an inch. This is only suggested as a last 
"resource, as cake is rendered less light by the process. 

TO CHECK BOILING SYRUP. 

In preserving, the syrup sometimes begins to rise so rap- 
idly that there is no time to move the heavy kettle aside. 
In such a case throw in about a teaspoonful of cold water 
and it will subside immediately. 

CAKE-BAKING. 

Do not begin to mix your cake until the fire is in perfect 
condition, and you have at hand every thing you may require. 
Use only the best butter, and fine, dry flour. Mix with a 
wooden spoon in a large bowl. Always grease loaf-pans, 
whether for bread or cake, with lard, not butter, as the latter 
scorches and blackens in long baking. The pan for loaf-cake 
should always be lined with a very thin paper thoroughly 
greased, to. keep it from sticking to the bottom, as well as 
from scorching. The paper should be left on the cake until 
the latter is cold, then carefully removed. 

Do not ice cake until cold. For baking drop or other 
small cakes, have at hand 2 or 3 sheets of tin or iron. These 
will be found to be much more convenient for the purpose 
than baking-pans. There are pans made expressly for baking 
lady-fingers and Eclairs. 



STRA Y NOTES. 543 

BAKING-PO WDER. 

Royal Baking-Powder is the best for raising cakes, etc. It 
seems to be perfectly harmless, and is certainly stronger than 
the others. The next best is Cleveland's, which is also very 
good, but not as strong. Where 3 teaspoonfuls of Cleve- 
land's are required, 2 of Royal Baking-Powder will be found 
to have quite as much effect. 

In most cases where baking-powder is required, you may 
substitute I teaspoonful of cream of tartar and )g teaspoonful 
of soda for i of baking-powder. 

FRUIT PIES. 

In making fruit pies, fasten a narrow band of muslin 
around, covering the edge of the pies. When they are 
baked, remove the muslin. This keeps in the juice and pre- 
vents the besmeared, untidy look which fruit pies generally 
have. 

THE USE OF RUM IN COOKING. 

Rum is an excellent addition, in the way of flavoring, to 
many sweet sauces, cakes, etc. Wherever called for by a 
receipt, always use Jamaica rum ; no other brand is suitable 
for the purpose. 

CROtfTONS AS A GARNISH. 

Croiitons cut in diamonds about 3 inches long, make a 
nice border for sweetbreads, stewed kidneys, fricassees, etc. 
When cut in cubes 1x2 inches, they make an excellent gar- 
nish for stewed fish, besides being an agreeable addition to 
the dish. 

MUSHROOMS. 

Stewed mushrooms may be served on crofltons 3x5 
inches, or in individual silver casseroles, or in china cases. 



544 GOOD-tlVING. 

PASTRY CROtjTONS AS A GARNISH. 

Roll out Flaky Crust or Puff Paste \ of an inch thick ; 
cut it in large diamonds, bake, and use to garnish the bor- 
ders of stews, etc. 

TO SERVE CORN. 

There are made at present, in very prettily embroidered 
designs, corn-cloths, which replace most advantageously the 
prevailing custom of serving green corn in a folded table- 
napkin, to keep it hot. 

TO SERVE CROQUETTES, ETC. 

Cut papers may be used not only under cakes and sweets, 
but may, with great advantage, replace the folded table- 
napkin in many cases, especially under croquettes, fried fish, 
etc., in fact, under any thing that is fried dry. They are 
now made at little cost ; the plainer designs are more suita- 
ble for the latter purpose, the lace-bordered ones being gen- 
erally used for sweets. The English make particularly pretty 
designs for the former use. 

TO SERVE FRENCH CHOPS, ETC. 

French chops, leg of mutton, ham, and barbecued hare or 
rabbit should always be served with paper frills to cover the 
ends of the bones. These frills are to be had of various 
sizes, and at small expense. 

TO SERVE WELSH RARE-BITS, ETC. 

Use for all dishes made of cheese, a hot-water plate ; this 
IS the only way to accomplish the necessary object of serv- 
ing the above perfectly hot. 

TO REMOVE FRUIT STAINS FROM LINEN. 

Pour boiling water through the spot before washing. Rub. 
If this does not succeed, moisten the spot and hold under it 
a lighted match. The sulphurous gas will cause the stain to 



STRAY NOTES. S4S 

disappear, it is said. Should this not be satisfactory, moIstCR 
tbp spot, rub it with a little salts-of-lemon. Hang it in the 
sun for a few minutes, then wash out thoroughly. This is 
good for extreme cases, but risks removing the fabric with 
the spot. Peach stains are especially obstinate, but will be 
found to disappear by degrees in the ordinary course of 
time and washing. 

TO REMOVE MILDEW STAINS. 

Soak in milk for 48 hours. Or, rub with lemon-juice and 
salt. The same remark applies to these as to peach stains. 

THE ICE-BOX. 

This is a detail about which many cooks are not suffi- 
ciently nice. If the ice-box is not kept perfectly sweet, the 
articles of food put into it will not be sweet either. It should 
have a very thorough cleaning from top to bottom at least 
once a week in winter, twice a week in summer, the water 
being emptied every day without fail. When the box is 
emptied, and thoroughly cleaned and overhauled, if any 
close smell should be perceived, wet a cloth with vinegar, 
wash over every part, and then leave the doors open until 
dry and well-aired. Allow no corner to be overlooked, if it 
is to be kept in perfect condition. 

Never allow butter to be kept in the same compartment 
of the box with any thing except sweet cream or unopened 
bottles. Nothing so quickly absorbs the taste of other 
things. The presence of lemons or melons will destroy 
the best butter ever made. 

TO PRESERVE ICE IN THE ICE-BOX. 

One of the best ways, when one's supply of ice begins to 
run short, is to wrap the ice in several thicknesses of news- 
paper. Wash well before using. 



546 GOOD-LIVING. 

TO REMOVE RUST FROM STEEL. 

Cover the steel with sweet oil, well rubbed in. After 48 
hours, rub it with finely-powdered, unslacked lime, until the 
rust disappears. 

N. B. — Do not let the lime touch the hands or it will 
burn them. 

REMEDY FOR BURNS. 

Grate or scrape a raw potato ; cover the burned part with 
it. As soon as it becomes hot, renew it ; continue to renew 
at intervals until relieved. Very simple, but most effica 
cious. Highly recommended. 

TO REMOVE THE UNPLEASANT ODOR FROM 
FEATHER PILLOWS. 

Hang them in a strong wind on a cloudy day ; do not 
put them in the sun. 

NOTE. 

In towns, all garbage should be burned ; this is by far the 
cleanest and healthiest mode of disposing of it, and is per- 
fectly practicable. 

TO SET THE COLOR IN CALICOES. 

Dissolve 2 gills of salt in l quart of boiling water, and, 
while hot, put the dress into it. Let it remain for several 
hours ; then dry it, after which wash as usual. Powdered 
alum is also used for the same purpose. 

TO REMOVE IRON-RUST STAINS FROM LINEN. 

When the article is washed, squeeze lemon-juice upon th^ 
spots ; cover them with salt ; lay them on the grass in the 
sun all day. Wash again, and in most cases the spots wiU 
have vanished ; if not, repeat the application. 



STRAY NOTES. 547 

WASH FOR CLEANING GLOVES. 

I quart of deodorized benzine, i drachm of sulphuric ether, 

I drachm of chloroform, 2 drachms of alcohol, 

A little cologne or other perfume. 

Mix together in a bo.ttle and cork tightly. Wash the 
gloves in the p/eparation as you would wash a handkerchief 
in water. It evaporates very rapidly. Hang the gloves in 
the open air to dry. This mixture is very inflammable. 

WASHING FLUID. 

4 gallons of water, y^ pound of unslacked lime, 

2 pounds of«rashing soda. 

Mix ; when settled and cold, skim off all scum. Bring 
to a boil ; remove from the fire. Let it settle, and pour off 
the clear fluid into stone jars for use. Or, bottle it, and cork 
tightly. For, washing, use l cup of the fluid to i pail of 
water. This resembles Javelle water. 

FURNITURE POLISH. 

4 ounces of gum shellac, i pint of alcohol, 

I piece of gum benzoin, as large as a hickory-nut. 

Mix, and rub on the furniture with a piece of canton-flaa

SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 

BROILED TROUT (MURRA Y BA Y). 

TRUITES GRILL^ES. 

Select brook trout weighing about i lb. each. Having 
cleaned them, make three diagonal cuts in each side. Have 
ready a clear hot fire. Heat and grease a wire gridiron, on 
which place the trout. Turn frequently from side to side 
until firm, and the flesh will easily separate from the bone 
at the head. Meanwhile put on a hot dish a large lump of 
butter rubbed up with finely-chopped parsley, enough to 
make the butter quite green. When the trout are done, lay 
them on the dish. Squeeze lemon-juice over them, add 
pepper and salt, baste with the parsley-butter, and serve 
very hot. 

PLANKED TROUT (MURRA Y BA Y). 

Take a large pine shingle. Clean and split the trout 
lengthwise, and tack it upon the shingle, fastening slices of 
bacon on with it. Broil the fish on the shingle in front of 
the fire, basting with the fat of the bacon, which is caught 
in a pan below the fish. When done, add pepper and salt, 
and serve very hot. 

TROUT A LA BECHAMEL (MURRAY BAY). 

TRUITES A LA B]£CHAMEL. 

Clean and boil brook trout of any size. When done, 
drain and put into a deep dish to cool. Heat a little vine-

SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 549 

gar and water (equal parts) in which are a few cloves and 
allspice. When the fish are cold, pour the hot vinegar, etc*, 
over them ; cover and set away. Next day take some of 
the trout and remove the flesh from the bones in large 
pieces. Lay the pieces loosely in a dish. Prepare a rich 
Cream Sauce (see receipt), and pour over the fish. Sprinkle 
the top with fine dried bread-crumbs, dot with bits of butter, 
and place in the oven for about 10 minutes, until thoroughly 
hot. 

TROUT SALAD (MURRA Y BA YJ. 

TRUITES k LA TARTARE. 

Having boiled the trout and put aside in vinegar, as in 
preceding receipt, remove the flesh from the bones in con- 
veniently large pieces. Lay them in a salad bowl. Make 
either a Mustard or a Tartare dressing (see receipts), and 
spread over the fish. Place small, crisp lettuce-leaves around 
the dish, and the hearts in the centre. Serve very cold. 
Salmon treated in the same manner is also delicious. 



MATELOTE OF TROUT (MURRAY BAY). 
TRUITES EN MATELOTE. 

These are excellent prepared exactly as Stewed Fish en 
Matelote, the only difference being that the fish (weighing 
about I lb. each) should be cooked whole, not cut in 
pieces.

CARBONADE A LA FLAMANDE. 

■2,\ lbs. of lean beef, sliced, Pepper, salt, sugar, 

4 onions cut fine,' I gill of vinegar, flour, 

Sprig of thyme, i bay leaf, Butter or sweet drippings. 

Reinove all the fat from the beef, which may be cut from 
the round. Pound until tender. Cut in neatly shaped 
pieces about 2X3 inches. Put a tablespoonful of sweet 
drippings into a frying-pan. When very hot, lay in the 
pieces of beef. As soon as all are in, begin to turn the first 
and so on, in order ; then remove them in the same order to 
a stew-pan. Now put the onions into a frying-pan and fry 
until slightly browned, but be very careful not to burn them. 
Add these to the beef, also the thyme, bay-leaf, salt, and 
pepper. Barely cover the meat with boiling water and i gill 
of vinegar. Simmer gently for i^ hours. Stir together in 
the frying-pan, i tablespoonful of flour, and a piece of butter 
the size of a walnut. When nicely browned, blend with 
some of the sauce of the meat, and stir smooth. Add this 
to the stewpan of beef, also a good pinch of sugar. Mix 
well, and boil 15 minutes longer. Then, if the meat is 
tender, remove it. If not, let it simmer gently a little lon- 
ger. Two hours in all should suffice, at most. Allow less 
time if a tenderer cut of beef is used. Serve with a border 
of plain boiled macaroni or rice, and this will be found most 
excellent.

Set it in a stewpan with enough very good consommd or 
bouillon to half cover it. Add a small piece of bay-leaf, a 
sprig of thyme, and J a gill of madeira, salt and pepper. 
Cover very closely, and allow it to simmer very gently until 
tender. The time will depend upon the age and size of the 
bird, say from 45 minutes to ij hours. Should the bird 
require long cooking, see that the broth does not evaporate, 
and if necessary add to it. When tender, remove the strings 
from the bird and place it in a small mould or bowl. Strain 
the broth, skim it and clear it with the white of an egg. Strain 
again, if necessary, through a flannel jelly-bag, and pour 
around the bird in a mould. Set away in a cold place. 
Serve cold with the jelly around it.

ARTICHAUTS FARCIS AUX CHAMPIGNONS. 
Having boiled some Globe ' or French Artichokes (see 
receipt), remove the leaves and bristles from the bottom and

trim the latter neatly. Prepare a stuffing of chopped fresh 
mushrooms, a few drops of onion-juice (or a tiny bit of 
pounded garlic), chopped parsley, the equivalent bulk of all 
three ingredients in stale bread-crumbs, a large lump of but- 
ter, salt, cayenne, and lemon-juice. Put the mixture in a 
saucepan over the fire and stir until the butter melts and is 
absorbed. With this mixture fill the artichokes that you 
have prepared. Sprinkle the tops lightly with dried bread- 
crumbs, and place in a bake-pan. Dot the tops with bits of 
butter. Put a few tablespoonfuls of strong broth in the pan. 
Set in the oven until thoroughly heated and delicately 
browned — lo to 15 minutes. Have ready small, round cro(i- 
tons the same size as the artichokes. Place a stuffed arti- 
choke on each crouton, strain the gravy from the pan over 
them and serve very hot. Highly recommended. 

N.B. — The " Fonds d'Artichauts " can be procured put up 
ready for use. 

TOMA TOES BAKED CREOLE STYLE. 

TOMATES A LA CREOLE. 

Use either fresh or canned tomatoes. If the former, peel 
and cut in large pieces before stewing. Put the tomatoes in 
a large china-lined stew pan (shallow), with a lump of butter 
and half an onion chopped fine. Two cans of tomatoes will be 
required to make a dish for 6 or 8 persons. Let them stew 
uncovered over a smart fire for 2 hours, stirring occasionally, 
and being careful not to allow them to scorch. By this time 
the greater part of the juice should have evaporated. Sea- 
son the tomatoes with salt, pepper, and a good pinch of. 
sugar, and put them in an earthenware bake-dish. Cover 
the top with bread-crumbs and dots of butter, and put in the 
oven for an hour or more, until well browned. Should any 
liquid remain, it would be well to let the dish gfand longer 
in the oven with the door open. They should, when suc- 
cessful, be like a rich paste. The heat of the oven must 
govern the length of time required to finish them properly.

Drain the liquid from a can of finest corn. Break into it 
the egg, add the seasoning and beat well together. Now 
stir in sufficient flour to make a batter stiff enough to drop 
from the spoon. Lastly add Royal baking-powder, allowing 
I teaspoonful to a cup of flour, according to what has been 
required for the batter. Have ready some lard deep enough 
to cover the fritters. When it is boiling, drop in the batter 
by the small teaspoonful. When golden brown on all sides, 
remove and drain in a sieve or on brown paper in the mouth 
of the oven. Serve very hot on a folded napkin or fancy

be added a little flavor of spices, set it away to cool, but not 
to harden. Then add the yolks of eggs beaten light. Put 
again on the fire and stir without ceasing until it begins to 
thicken as a custard. Then pour this back and forth until 
perfectly cold. Rinse out a mould with cold water. Pour 
in the mixture and set away to harden. 

N. B. In preparing the wine jelly, care should be taken 
not to make it too stiff, as the addition of the eggs tends to 
make it still firmer.

DIANA SOUP. 



POTAGE DIANE. 



z hen-partridges, not too young, 

2 carrots, 
I leek, 

\ bay-leaf, 

3 cloves. 



2 quarts meat broth, cold, 
I large onion, quartered. 
Bunch parsley and celery, 
Small sprig thyme, 
5 allspice. 



Clean the partridges and put in a stewpan with the vege- 
tables, seasoning, and broth. Note that the broth -must not 
have a strong meat-flavor, else it will cover the delicate flavor 
of the partridges. Cover and boil gently until the flesh be- 
gins to detach itself from the bones. Remove the flesh and 
return the carcases to the soup, which must continue to boil 
until the broth has a rich, fine flavor and is reduced to about 
I quart. Pour it off through a sieve into a china bowl and 
set aside for the sediment to settle. Meanwhile put the 
dark meat and broken scraps of the flesh into a mortar, re- 
serving the good pieces of breast, which cover carefully and 
set away. Pound well the pieces in the mortar, adding a 
fully equal bulk of panada (that is, white crumb of bread 
boiled to a paste in milk), or a small quantity of fine grated 
bread-crumbs, but the panada makes the best quenelles. 
Pound all well together; add pepper, .salt, a small pinch of 
grated nutmeg, i or 2 tablespoonfuls of stiff whipped cream, 
or, failing this, a lump of fresh butter, size of a hickory-nut. 
Pound until absolutely smooth and fine. (It is well even to 
sift the pounded meat before adding the panada.) < Add one 
whole egg, and pound until it disappears absolutely in the

mass, A second white of egg may be added if the bulk of 
paste is fairly large. Now put a saucepan of salted boiling 
water on the fire. Let it boil briskly, then set a little aside 
where it will continue to boil gently, so that the water is al- 
most quiet. Now take up with a teaspoon bits of the paste 
the size of a hazel-nut, or of a hickory-nut ; form into balls, 
touching very little, and drop these into the boiling water. 
Try one or two first, and if too hard add a little cream, or if 
too soft add another white of egg. The water, if boiling too 
violently, will break the balls ; or if not boiling enough, will 
give them time to melt. Therefore, best to try a small 
quantity until everything is just to suit. As soon as the 
quenelles are firm, remove them with a perforated skimmer 
to a plate. When ready to serve the soup, cut the breasts 
of partridges in dice and place them in the tureen. Pour the 
cold broth carefully,. so as not to disturb the sediment, into 
a clean saucepan. Bring it to a boil ; add salt and pepper, if 
necessary. When boiling, thicken very slightly with corn- 
starch dissolved in a little cold broth. Stir and boil 2 or 3 
minutes till the corn-starch is cooked. At last moment add 
about 2 tablespoonfuls of good Madeira. Strain, boiling, 
into the tureen. Add the quenelles, cover, and in 2 or 3 
minutes it may be served, giving just the time necessary for 
the quenelles to heat in the soup, for, if the boiling soup be 
poured on the quenelles, there is risk of breaking them. 

A NEW OX.TAIL SOUP. 

POTAGE QUEUE DE BCEUF. 

Cut in 2-inch lengths an ox-tail, which wash and drain 
thoroughly. Put a soup-kettle on the fire with 3 quarts of 
cold water, i pound of shin of beef, and the pieces of ox-tail. 
Bring to a brisk boil ; skim, and set back on the range where 
it will simmer gently, but absolutely without interruption.

the ox-tail is about half done, and the bones can be with- , 
drawn, take them from the kettle, drain, and bone. Now 
put these in a pan with i gill of white wine, a pinch of pep- 
per, and a little concentrated meat-juice (glaze). Cover 
and allow to simmer very gently. Meanwhile mix together 
in a saucepan over the fire, i heaping tablespoon of butter 
and two of rice flour (or ordinary flour — the former makes a 
more transparent thickening). When thoroughly blended 
and a little browned, add a teacupful of good tomato-purde. 
Mix well till smooth. When the broth in the kettle is boiled 
down to 2 quarts, pass it through a sieve and add it to the 
saucepan of tomato-pur^e. Bring to a boil, and set back on 
the range to settle. When ready to serve, skim once more ; 
pour into the tureen through a fine strainer. Add the tails 
and serve. 

SOLE A LA FLORENTINE. 

Note. — This receipt, as indeed nearly all those given for 
sole, may be used for any other fine fish which may be 
either filleted or cut in neat steaks. 

Prepare a fine, well-seasoned purde of young spinach, to 
which add a little thick sweet cream and a piece of fresh 
butter. Spread a thick layer of this on the bottom of a flat, 
fire-proof bakedish. Meanwhile, having prepared filets of 
the fish, "poach" them in salted boiling water until just 
firm — no more. Lay these. upon the spinach, when perfectly 
drained. Over all spread a layer of thick, rich Cream Sauce ; 
again over this a coating of grated parmesan and gruyfere - 
cheese mixed ; sprinkle lightly with dried sifted bread-crumbs 
and dots of butter. Set in the oven till golden brown and 
serve in same dish. 

SOLE A LA MALMAISON. 

The filets iji this case are to be cut in two across the 
length, that is, short and broad ; 4 filets on each side, 8 per 
sole. Wash and dry. Prepare in a fire-proof bakedish. 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 567 

which has a cover, a lump of fresh butter melted. When 
very hot, lay in the filets, and cook gently till firm, but do 
not allow them to brown, save perhaps on the edges. There 
should be butter enough to cover them, and the fire not too 
sharp. Cut in small pieces 2 artichokes, using the cup part 
only (fonds d'artichauts), for each sole. If not prepared in 
tins, then they must be previously boiled. Put these in the 
butter around and between the filets. Add a little lemon- 
juice, \ teaspoonful of Worcestershire Sauce, a little chopped 
parsley, pepper and salt. Cover and cook very gently for 
10 minutes. Serve in the same covered fire-proof dish. 

SOLE, VENETIAN FASHION. 
SOLE A LA V^NITIENNE. 

Filet 2 sole, that is, make 4 of each fish. Remove all 
bones and trim the edges neatly. Now take ^ lb. of any 
fine fresh fish : pike is most frequently used for the purpose, 
being esteemed in Europe as among the most delicate of fish. 
Remove skin and bones and pound the raw fish in a mortar 
with 2 oz. butter and a little less than 2 oz. of panada (white 
crumb of bread boiled in milk to a paste), also 2 or 3 yolks 
of egg. Pound very thoroughly — the longer the better — as 
this makes the preparation more delicate. Press the whole 
through a sieve. Season with salt, pepper, and a very little 
nutmeg. Now work in rapidly 3 tablespoonfuls of whipped 
cream and 2 tablespoonfuls of mixed fine herbs — shallot, 
parsley, tarragon, and chervil ; also a few mushrooms, all 
chopped as fine as can be. When this is ready, spread each 
sole-filet on one side with the mixture, and fold it together 
with the dressing inside. Melt a good lump of butter in 
a saucepan ; lay in carefully the filets, moisten with a lit- 
tle white wine ; cover with a buttered paper, and set in a 
moderate oven until firm, then set aside to keep warm. 

Take what remains of the dressing after spreading with it 
the filets, as above ; roll lightly in balls the size of a hickory- 
nut, and poach in salted boiling water, which must not boil

hard when you put in the quenelles, lest they break. When 
firm, remove with a skimmer, drain, and place in a saucepan 
with a handful of boiled and shelled shrimps, and 2 or 3 
tablespoonfuls of the Venetian Sauce described below. 
Whan ready to serve, arrange the filets in a circle, with the 
•quenelles and shrimps in the centre, pour a little of the sauce 
over, and serve the rest in a sauceboat. Sauce Venitienne 
is made as follows : First put in a bright saucepan a large 
tablespoonful of good wine-vinegar, a piece of bay-leaf, salt, 
whole pepper, a sprig of thyme, parsley, and tarragon. Boil 
slowly till reduced \, then strain and set aside. Now take 
the liquor in which the filets have been cooked and to this 
add about \ cupful of rich White Sauce. Mix well, and 
boil down to a rich, creamy consistency. To this may be 
added a little concentrated meat-juice (glaze), also the vin- 
egar previously prepared as above. Pass the sauce through 
a fine sieve. Heat again and add i teaspoonful of fresh 
butter, I tablespoonful of finely-chopped mixed parsley and 
tarragon, also i or 2 drops of tabasco, or a very little cay- 
enne pepper. Serve immediately, a portion poured over the 
fish, the rest in a sauceboat. 

INDIAN LOBSTER. 

HOMARD A L'INDIENNE. 

Take 2 rather small live lobsters. Plunge them head fore- 
rtiost into boiling water just long enough to kill them. Chop 
them, shell and all, in lengths of from 2 to 3 inches. Now 
cut in small dice i onion and 2 shallots. Fry these very 
slightly in a good tablespoonful of fine olive-oil. Now add 
to this the pieces of lobster, and cook over a brisk fire for a 
few minutes — about 3. Add salt, a saltspoonful of very 
good curry-powder, a gill of white wine, ^ teacupful of 
good rich White or Cream Sauce. Mix well ; cover and set 
the saucepan where the lobster will cook gently for another 
fifteen minutes, or even twenty. 

Have ready boiled and well dried a good J cupful of rice 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 569 

(measured raw), to which add a lump of fresh butter and a 
pinch of curry powder. Arrange the rice in a circle on a hot 
dish ; fill the centre with the pieces of lobster, and place 
where it will keep hot. 

Return the lobster sauce to the fire. Skim off any fat, 
and when it has boiled hard for about 3 minutes, pour this 
on the yolks of 2 eggs. Beat, and stir over a gentle fire till 
hot. Then strain over the rice and lobster, and serve. To 
make a crown of rice, the best way is to butter a border- 
mould very generously, to press in the rice firmly, heat 
enough to melt the butter on the inner sides of the mould, 
and turn out immediately on a round dish. Do not 
bake it. 

COLD SALMON RUSSIAN STYLE. 

SAUMON FROID A LA RUSSE. 

Take a slice of salmon from the broadest part of the fish, 
and from 6 to 8 inches thick. Boil in salted water. When 
thoroughly done, place it in a deep dish on one of the cut 
sides. Cover and set away until pei;fectly cold. Have 
ready equal portions of all fine summer vegetables, also 
cauliflower and artichokes, the latter especially to garnish, 
as also beet-root. Boil and chill all. Make a Mustard Dress- 
ing, or a Sauce Emmanuel, adding 3 drops of tabasco, or a 
pinch of cayenne. Mix together all except the artichokes 
and a portion of the cauliflower and beet-root. Now remove 
the outer skin carefully from the salmon, and place it on 
a round dish, always on one of the cut sides. Around 
this pink centre arrange tastefully the dressed vegetables. 
Now fill the cups of the artichokes (fonds d'artichauts) with 
some of the same dressed vegetables, place them around 
the dish as a garnish, with sprigs of cauliflower, beets cut in 
a design, etc., etc., as your taste may suggest. In the mid- 
dle of the salmon put a bunch of green parsley, and serve. 
Or the salmon may be served without the salad as above, 
also cold, and jellied in fish-jelly, as described for Jellied

FRITURE A L'iTALIENNE. 

Take of every available fish, the small ones whole, the 
larger filleted, cold boiled cauliflower in pieces, balls made 
of cold boiled spinach, the leaves and cups of artichokes, 
etc., etc. Dip separately in a light batter and fry in boiling 
oil, or in deep boiling lard. When golden brown, skim out, 
drain thoroughly ; pile on a napkin, and serve with Tomato 
Sauce, Sauce Tartare, or other thick, tasty sauce. Garnish 
with fried parsley. This as given is for fish, but the same 
is also made with pieces of cold chicken, tongue, ham, 
sweetbreads, calf's brains, balls of croquette-meat, and all 
the vegetables mentioned above, some of each, all dipped, 
fried, mixed well, and served with one of the sauces already 
mentioned. 

. FLEMISH FISH SOUP. 

WATERZEU DE POISSON. 

This resembles in a measure chowder made with fresh- 
water fish. Those generally used in combination are perch, 
tench, sole, eels ; to these, or to replace them, might be 
used catfish, lake-bass, or any good small fish. 

First wash well and remove the heads. The eels should 
be scalded on the fire for lo minutes, then cut in 2-inch 
lengths. In a saucepan on the fire put all the heads, and 
clean trimmings, such as fins and tails, with 4 leeks, i onion, 
2 cloves, and a little parsley root, and water to cover. 
When cooked long enough to be well flavored, pass through 
a sieve ; add salt and pepper to taste. Set again on the fire 
in a saucepan ; lay the little fish and eels in this fish-broth, 
and simmer until the fish are cooked. Have ready a tureen 
in which put dice of white stale bread, a lump of fresh but- 
ter, and some chopped parsley. Lay the fish on these ; pour 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 57 1 

the fish-broth over all. Cover ; let stand 2 or 3 minutes, then 
serve. 

FISH LOAF. 

PAIN DE POISSON. 

This may be made in two ways. Either follow the pro- 
portions given for Veal Loaf (see receipt), replacing all the 
meat by an equal quantity of cold boiled and boned fish, 
or as follows: Chop the cold boiled and boned fish and 
rub it through a sieve. Prepare a rich sauce by boiling the 
fish bones and trimmings with good seasonings. Strain it 
and use it in preference to milk for your White Sauce, thick- 
ening as usual. Of this sauce use a quantity about equal to 
the fish. Strain the sauce and mix it thoroughly with the 
fish. Add pepper, essence of anchovy, a little chopped 
parsley and a very small pinch of grated nutmeg. Now beat 
in the yolks of 3 eggs to a pint of the preparation. Beat to 
a stiff froth the 3 whites, and beat them thoroughly into the 
mass, which should now be like a quite thick batter. Take 
a tin mould with straight sides (or a border-mould, but this 
may be more difficult to manage at first). Rub thoroughly 
inside with bdtter and dust over with sifted bread-crumbs. 
Fill f full of the preparation. Stand the mould in a pan of 
boiling water and bake in the oven 45 minutes. Should the 
top brown too quickly, cover with a buttered paper. Turn 
out on a flat dish and serve with Anchovy Sauce ; or if in a 
border-mould, the centre may be filled with creamed lobster, 
or creamed oysters, or with mushrooms, and served with the 
necessary sauce. If in border-mould, bake shorter time. 

DEVILLED CRABS, COLD. 

Prepare according to usual receipt, and set away to cool in 
the shells. Serve very cold, with Sauce Emmanuel or Sauce

t£te de cabillaud a la flamande. 

Having washed and wiped dry a young cod's head, put it 
in a saucepan with a lump of fresh butter, \ bay-leaf, small 
sprig of dried thyme, parsley, salt, pepper, a very small 
quantity of grated nutmeg and a large wineglass of white

the bones. Take out the herbs ; thicken the sauce with dry 
Foiled cracker-crumbs, and serve in a deep dish. 

FISH FRIED IN BA TTER. 

Take various small fish, such as smelt, whiting, young cod, 
etc. Wash, wipe, dip in batter, and fry golden brown in 
deep lard. Drain thoroughly. Fry a bunch of parsley. 
Garnish with this and cut lemon. Serve at same time a 
Tomato or Tartare Sauce. Fresh sardines are especially 
good done in this way. 

SALT COD AND TOMATOES. 
BRANDADE DE MORUE. 

Soak some very white, good salt cod over night. Mix in 
a saucepan over the fire i tablespoonful of butter and 2 of 
flour until slightly browned. Stir in a cupful of the thin 
part of stewed tomatoes, heated. Stir smooth and set aside 
while you stew in butter i chopped onion and 2 shallots, or 
a small clove of garlic; add the fruit of the tomatoes from 
which you have strained the juice for the sauce. Add these, 
when fried, to the sauce, also 4 or 5 potatoes cut in pieces. 
Cover and stew till the potatoes begin to go to pieces. 
Meanwhile boil the codfish in plain water until nearly half 
done, then drain and add this to the stew an hour before 
serving. Stew carefully, not to scorch. Serve with croutons.

TRUFFLED VEAL. 

NOIX DE VEAU A LA PERIGUEUX. 

Remove all gristle, skin, and sinews from a filet of veal. 
Take a large trufifle and cut it in long, thin strips, like maca- 
roni. Make slits in the top of the veal, and introduce in 
each a strip of truffle, as if you were larding the veal. When 
this is done cover over and around the filet with thin slices 
of fresh fat pork, binding or skewering them fast. Have 
ready a flat-bottomed stewpan, in which melt a large tea- 
spoonful of butter, then cover the bottom with thin slices of 
raw ham, carrots, and onion. On this place the veal. Cook 
briskly for a few minutes, then, when sufficiently seared to 
keep the juice in the meat, add i large tablespoonful of 
madeira, and continue 2 minutes more the brisk cooking, 
without covering the pan. Now add 3 gills of very strong 
broth, a bouquet of parsley, sprig of thyme, \ bay-leaf, 2 
cloves, 3 allspice, l or 2 shallots, or i clove of garhc, celery- 
leaves, a little salt and pepper. Cover air-tight and place in 
a moderate oven, being very careful to baste now and again. 
When cooked sufficiently (allowing quite 20 minutes to the 
pound in a moderate oven), remove the veal to a dish ; take 
off the pork and keep the meat hot. Skim the sauce that 
remains in the stewpan, and return it to the fire, adding a 
little concentrated meat-juice (glaze) or a little Liebig's Ex- 
tract. When this is melted, put back the veal in the pan ; 
baste it well with this sauce while you expose the surface, 
uncovered, to the heat from above : that is, either under the 
bars of the grate, if the fire is clear, or on the top shelf of 
the well-heated oven, with door open — do this till the top is 
nicely glazed. Dish the veal. Now add to the veal gravy 
in the stewpan i gill of thick brown sauce or very strong 
broth and Liebig's Extract, and i gill of madeira (also i gill 
of thick tomato-pur^e). Bring to a brisk boil for 2 or 3 
minutes, till reduced to a good strength and consistency — it 
must not be at all watery ; pass through a strainer, a few

spoonfuls over the meat, the remainder in a sauceboat in 
which you have put some of the trufifle, chopped. 

CARBONNADE FLAMANDE. 

2 lbs. sliced round of beef, 3 tablespoonfuls of flour, 

I tablespoonful of butter, i pt. of broth, 

6 chopped onions, ^ pt. stewed tomatoes, 

Salt and pepper, \ pt. red wine. 

Bunch of parsley and herbs. 

Brown the beef slightly on both sides in a frying-pan with 
the butter, pepper, and salt, then lay it in the saucepan. 
Now brown the onions in the butter, then stir the flour into 
these, and, when well mixed and a little browned, add these 
to the saucepan. Now add the broth, tomatoes, and wine, 
and bunch of sweet herbs, Mix well together, cover, and 
stew gently for quite two hours. Before serving, remove the 
bunch of herbs. Serve with a dish of mashed potato or plain 
macaroni. 

VEAL KIDNEYS 1 LA PROVENgALE. 

Rub together over the fire i teaspoonful of butter, 2 of 
flour, with I teaspoonful of fine olive-oil, salt, pepper, and 2 
or 3 finely chopped shallots. Stir together over a gentle fire 
and add the kidneys cut in squares, after scalding as in 
receipt for Stewed Kidneys. Now add 4 tablespoonfuls of 
thick tomato-purde and a few drops of lemon-juice. Season 
to taste. If too liquid, add a little fine dried and sifted 
bread-crumb. Serve in a deep dish. 

STEWED KIDNEYS. 
ROGNONS SAUTES. 

For this may be used veal kidneys or fine young mutton 
or lamb kidneys. Throw them into boiling water for 2 
minutes, then drain and throw into cold water for about 
same, to chill them. Remove the sinews and cut in small 
pieces, or in slices. Now put these in a stewpan with a 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 575 

spoonful of fresh butter, salt, and pepper, and stew for 5 
minutes. Have ready an equal bulk of fresh mushrooms 
stewed in butter. When the kidneys are ready, mix in the 
mushrooms, a wineglass of madeira, a pinch of mustard and 
some chopped parsley. Haveready some croutons. Thicken 
the kidney sauce slightly with corn-starch. Serve in a deep 
dish, garnished with the crofltons. Note : Kidneys require 
very little cooking, otherwise they harden. 

SCOTCH COLLOPS. 

Take a slice of raw beef, round or other. Hash very fine. 
Pull out every thread and coarse fibre. Now put in the 
chafing-dish and add a little cold water. Cook until gray- 
brown, putting in a tiny lump of butter. Do not stir, but 
pat down with the back of the spoon, turning over quickly 
and frequently so that each particle of meat gets its share 
of the cooking. When nearly done, add a little hot water to 
make the gravy ; then dredge in a little flour, add a piece of 
butter and a little pepper. Mix well, and only at the last 
moment add a little salt. Have ready slices of toast. Put 
the collops on the toast, add a poached egg to each piece, 
and serve. The collops should be of the consistency of soft 
hash. 

TOURNEDOS A UX ARTICHA UTS. 

SMALL FILETS OF BEEF WITH ARTICHOKES. 

Cut slices f inch thick from the fine end of the filet of 
beef, even in size. Pound these with a few quick strokes 
and form them again evenly. Cut slices of stale bread of 
exactly same size as the little filets, one for each. Fry the 
bread very lightly on both sides and place on a hot dish. 
Baste these with a coating of very strong, rich brown gravy, 
and let it sink into the bread. Have also ready, heated, the 
under part of artichokes, one for each filet. Prepare also 
some B6arnaise Sauce (see receipt). When everything is 



576 GOOD-LIVING. 

ready at hand, broil the filets over a quick, bright fire, turn- 
ing very often. When done, place one on each croflton, and 
moisten with some of the same rich meat-gravy. Place on 
the top of each, one of the artichokes ; fill the cup of this 
with B^arnaise and serve immediately. 

TOURNEDOS TIRO LIENS. 

Prepare, broil, and dish on crofltons, as directed in forego- 
ing receipt. Garnish the dish \ with thick stewed, fried or 
baked tomatoes ; \ with fried potatoes cut the size of a straw, 
and fried very pale color; the remaining \ with a green 
vegetable, such as string beans, braised lettuce, Brussels 
sprouts or spinach. Then cover each Tournedos with 
Bdarnaise Sauce and serve immediately.

about \ inch thick. Prepare a force-meat with the chopped 
veal, I egg, and mushrooms, all well pounded together. 
Cover each side of the slices of sweetbread with this mix- 
ture. Dip each slice so prepared, first in fine sifted bread- 
crumbs, then in beaten egg, and again in bread-crumbs; 
then fry golden brown in hot butter, and serve with Mush- 
room Sauce. Note. — Before frying, it is, as a rule, better 
to allow all things that are dipped as above to stand 
awhile.

rub inside thoroughly with butter. In the centre place a 
round piece of stale bread about 3 inches thick. Around 
the bread, spread on the bottom of the dish a layer of the 
force-meat. On this place in a circle the slices of sweetbread. 
On these spread the remaining force-meat, and on this the 
rest of the slices, overlapping. Let the force-meat fill evenly 
all the spaces between. On each slice place a mushroom. 
Cover with buttered paper and bake 45 minutes. Remove 
the bread from the centre ; fill the space with stewed mush- 
rooms, and serve with a Mushroom Sauce made with the 
broth in which the sweetbreads were boiled. Serve in the 
same dish in which they have been baked.

MINCE WITH EGG AND CHEESE. 

Prepare even slices of toast. Make a fine mince of veal, 
Iamb, or chicken. Make a thick Cream Sauce. Mix a very 
little of this with the mince and arrange this on the toast, as 
thick a layer as you can manage. On each of these place a 
poached egg. Cover all with thick Cream Sauce ; cover the 
sauce with grated parmesan and gruyfere, and this again with 
fine bread-crumbs and dots of butter. Set in the oven only 
long enough to melt the butter and heat all thoroughly, 
then serve. The egg must be very soft, or the oven will 
harden it too much, A good lunch relish. 

WIENER SCHNITZEL. 

Cut rather thin slices from a white and tender leg of veal 
— thinner than for the ordinary veal cutlet. Pound with a 
few short, sharp strokes. Form again into shape. Dip in 
egg and sifted bread-crumb, pepper,^and salt. Fry quickly 
in ^ butter and \ lard mixed ; the fat must be as hot as for 
croquettes. When firm to the touch, and golden brown, lay 
them on a hot dish. On each slice put a boneless anchovy 
rolled up, and around the anchovy put capers*. Garnish 
with quarters of lemon and serve. 

LUNCH HAM WITH MADEIRA SAUCE. 

Cut large, very thin slices of ham which has been boiled. 
Prepare a pur^e of spinach, which arrange on a round dish. 
Warm the ham, but do not let it curl or crisp. Roll it up, 
cigarette-fashion, and lay around, against the spinach. Serve 
with a brown sauce well flavored with madeira. 

RICE AND SAUSAGES FOR LUNCHEON. 

Boil a cupful of rice in broth until tender. Drain and dry 
as usual. Cut the stem-end from 8 tomatoes, which roast in 
the oven with bread-crumbs and butter on. the cut side, also 
pepper, salt, and chopped parsley. Bake in a moderate oven 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. S79 

until browned on the edges— nearly i hour. Broil or fry in 
the pan 8 sausages. Put the rice in a thick layer on a round 
dish and place alternately the sausages and tomatoes around 
on the rice. With this serve a brown sauce with curry ; or 
may be served without sauce. The sausages may be replaced 
with ham cut thin, warmed, and rolled up. 

SCALLOP SHELLS FOR LUNCHEON. 

Fill with ^ each of mushrooms which have been stewed, 
and cold veal, chicken, turkey, lamb or boned fish, in small 
pieces. Moisten with some of the Mushroom Sauce and a 
very little broth for the meat, or with White Sauce or fish- 
broth — but very little of either. Sprinkle with bread-crumbs 
and butter, pepper, and salt, and bake until well browned. 
Do not cut the mushrooms too small. 

VEAL WITH ENDIVES FOR LUNCHEON. 

Endives, or escarolle, can be prepared in this case like 
spinach, but not chopped so fine. Cut even slices of cold 
filet of veal ; dip in egg and bread-crumbs and fry in hot butter. 
Dish in a circle on a bed of the vegetable and serve. 

TOMATO-RICE WITH CHICKEN LIVERS. 

Scald, drain and saut6 the livers in butter for a very few 
minutes, being careful not to harden by too much cooking. 
Take boiled rice well dried. Mix with it by the spoonful 
tomato pur6e until the rice i^ reddened but does not stick 
together like a paste. Have ready also some strips of ham, 
warmed. Put the rice on the bottom of the dish ; make a 
hollow in the centre, in which place the chicken livers, gar- 
nish the rice with the strips of ham, and serve with dry 
grated cheese. 

GERMAN MEAT-CAKE FOR LUNCHEON. 

Prepare a fine, tasty mince of chicken and tongue, or

truffle — much like croquette-meat. Then make 4 very thin 
large pancakes, omitting the sugar. Put one on the bottom 
of a hot dish, spread over this a layer of mince, and repeat 
this, finishing with the pancake. Serve very hot with a good 
brown sauce. 

PIGEONS WITH OLIVES. 

PIGEONS AUX OLIVES. 

Draw and truss very young and tender pigeons. Place 
them in a fire-proof dish with a good piece of butter. Leave 
uncovered till the pigeons have browned slightly over the 
hot fire, then add salt, pepper, a gill of dry white wine, a 
small teaspoonful of concentrated meat-juice (glaze), and ^ a 
gill of strong broth? also a handful of olives which have been 
stoned, scalded in salted boiling water, and drained. Now 
cover the fire-proof dish and place where it will cook very 
gently. If on the top of the range, it must be stood in a pan 
of boiling water (bain-marie) ; or may be set in a moderate 
oven, and basted now and again. For very young squabs, ^ 
hour may suffice, but more probably 45 minutes and more, 
according to size and age. Remove the fat from the sauce, 
and serve the pigeons with olives and sauce in same fire-proof 
covered dish in which they were cooked. 

Note. To replace " glaze," which is not always at hand, 
add to your sauce of good, well-boiled-down broth a little 
Liebig's Extract, and thicken at the last with just enough 
corn-starch to take off all thin, watery quality. In every in- 
stance mix the corn-starch well with a little cold broth, and 
let it boil very briskly for at least two minutes. 

DAINTY STUFFED PIGEONS. 

PIGEONS FARCIS AUX FOIES DE VOLAILLES. 

Select young and tender pigeons. Clean and prepare. 
Have ready a dressing made as follows : Chicken livers (allow- 
ing 2 or 3 to eaqh pigeon) scalded and mashed ; same bulk of 



SUPPLEMENTAL y RECEIPTS. §81 

grated stale bread-crumbs ; fine-chopped fat pork, ham, pars- 
ley, onion-juice, a few drops of lemon-juice, very little grated 
nutmeg (or none), pepper and salt, all thoroughly pounded 
together till perfectly blended; add one egg, or 2 yolks and 
I white to enough dressing for 4 pigeons. Too much egg, 
especially white, hardens a delicate dressing. Now fill the 
pigeons between the skin and the flesh as m,uch as they will 
contain, putting the remainder in the bodies. Tie, or sew 
well, that the dressing may not run out in the cooking. 
Truss the pigeons neatly and brown lightly in hot butter. 
Meanwhile have ready, cooked tender in good broth, the fol- 
lowing vegetables, cut in small, even, neat pieces : Carrots, 
leeks, turnips, a little tender celeriac, and ordinary celery. 
Put the vegetables in a stewpan, lay the pigeons on this bed. 
Cover perfectly tight and set in a very moderate oven, or on 
a corner of the range where they will simmer very gently. 
If very young, an hour will sufifice ; but old ones may require 
4 to 6 hours of very slow cooking to make them quite per- 
fect, as slow cooking is essential. If they take long, pay 
great attention that they do not become dry, and add from 
time to time, as may be necessary, a little good broth — but 
on the other hand, avoid making the dish like a stew, im- 
mersed in liquid. It must be rich and juicy, and the sauce 
should take a ,good brown color. When cooked, place the 
pigeons in the centre of a dish ; drain out the vegetables and 
arrange them around. Boil down quickly the sauce, adding 
a few spoonfuls of rich brown gravy, if you have it, or broth 
and a little corn-starch to thicken. Boil briskly for 2 minutes 
more, add a tablespoonful of madeira, and serve in a sauce- 
boat. 

WATERZEU O'F CHICKEN. 

Clean and truss a chicken, less young and tender than for 
roasting. Put it in a saucepan with a piece of calf's foot cut 
fine, an onion chopped (or 2 or 3 shallots chopped) ; a carrot 
and bunch of soup-herbs tied together, and 2 teacupfuls of 
celery cut in inch-lengths; also add salt and pepper. Cover 



582 GOOD-LIVING. 

entirely with cold water. Bring to a brisk boil ; skim, cover, 
and set back where it will simmer gently for perhaps 2 hours. 
But watch it, and as soon as the flesh looks at all ready to 
leave the bones, remove the chicken to a soup-tureen. 
Throw away the carrots and the bunch of herbs, and return 
the sauce and celery to the fire. Boil briskly for a few min- 
utes ; then stir in a very little corn-starch dissolved in a very 
small quantity of cold broth ; boil for 2 minutes. Add 2 or 
3 tablespoonfuls of rich cream, if available, and pour into the 
tureen, in which, together with the chicken, you have put a 
few dice of dry, stale bread. Cover and serve. This is eaten 
in soup-plates with fork and spoon. The chicken should not 
fall from the bones, but only just remain in shape. 

Waterzeu of Fish is also a popular Flemish dish. See 
receipt for same. 

MILANESE CHICKEN. 

POULET MILANAISE. 

Prepare a fine, large, tender chicken (or capon) by braising 
it (see receipt). Meanwhile, boil a cupful of well-washed 
rice in good bouillon until tender, then drain thoroughly. 
Prepare also a rich White Sauce made with good broth, 
adding a few spoonfuls of rich cream. Lay the rice in a 
thick layer on a round, fire-proof dish. Cut the chicken in 
large even pieces and pile these on the rice, packing them 
firmly in a mound, leaving an edge of rice beyond, all around. 
Now cover this carefully with a thick layer of the sauce, 
letting the latter fill every chink and space between the 
pieces of chicken, keeping the surface smooth. Over this 
put a thick layer of grated parmesan and gruyfere cheese. 
Set in a brisk oven till golden brown, and serve. 

Small slices of ham may be placed between the pieces of 
chicken, and a raw egg may be beaten into the thick 
sauce when it is not boiling, and before covering the 
chicken. 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 583 

BRAISED CHICKEN WITH TOMATOES. 

POULET BRAIS£ AUX TOMATES. 

The tender chicken being properly cleaned and trussed, 
set a stewpan on the fire with a good teaspoon ful of butter. 
Melt slowly, then draw forward where it will cook more 
rapidly, and lay in the chicken, turning on one side and an- 
other until of a nice, golden color ; then set the stewpan on 
one side where it will cook more slowly. Peel, cut in quar- 
ters, and fry quickly in butter 4 tomatoes, about 5 minutes. 
Add these to the chicken, also 3 or 4 finely-chopped shallots 
which have been fried with the tomatoes; or these may be 
replaced by a half onion, chopped. Add also a little pepper, 
salt, a piece of sweet pepper, and 2 gills of good broth. 
Close very tightly, and simmer gently for half an hour or 
longer, according to size, age, and quality of chicken. Give 
it ample time to cook gently. Before serving, skim off all 
unnecessary butter and grease from the sauce ; add to it 
a small spoonful of madeira, a teaspoonful of finely-chopped 
parsley, and serve with the tomato, without straining the 
sauce. Or the chicken may be finished in the oven in a 
brown fire-proof dish, and served in the same covered dish. 

CURRIED CHICKEN WITH VERMICELLI. 

This is prepared according to usual receipt, excepting 
that the rice is replaced by vermicelli which is boiled in 
strong, good broth (chicken preferred), and when well 
drained, is served around the chicken. 

BRAISED GOOSE WITH CHESTNUTS. 

Draw, singe, and truss a fine young goose. Melt a tea- 
spoonful of butter in a saucepan where the goose can be 
admitted without much waste space. When the butter is 
hot, lay in the goose and let it brown lightly on all sides. 
Then add an onion and a carrot sliced, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, and ^ tumbler of white wine. Let this cook off un- 



584 GOOD-LIVING. 

til the liquid is almost entirely evaporated. Add then salt, 
pepper, and good broth to \ the height of the goose. Now 
cover air-tight and set the saucepan in a moderate oven. 
Open from time to time and baste. If the broth cooks away 
too much, add, but not more than a gill at a time ; preferably 
less, as the goose will otherwise have a taste of stew. It 
will require from an hour to \\ for a young goose — more, 
the older and tougher it is, for it must cook very gently. 

Prepare the chestnuts as follows: Take 25 large French 
chestnuts. .Split and roast slightly. Remove shells and 
skins ; lay the chestnuts in a saucepan with a pinch of salt 
■ and 3 lumps of sugar. Add a little broth and cook gently 
till this is almost evaporated — that is, until the chestnuts 
become glac^d, each retaining its shape, and covered with 
a coating of glaze. To serve the goose, cut it in proper 
pieces, arrange it on a dish with a mound of chestnuts at 
each end. Meanwhile remove all fat from the sauce in 
which the goose has cooked ; strain it, and, if the quantity 
is insufficient, add a little boiling strong broth, a little con- 
centrated meat-juice (or Liebig's Extract) and a wineglass 
of madeira. Boil down quickly ; strain. Pour part over the 
goose and the chestnuts, and serve the remainder in the 
sauceboat. 

CHA UD-FROIDS AND JELLIED DISHES. 
CHAUD-FROID OF CHICKEN. 
CHAUD-FROID DE POULET. 

Clean and truss a fine young, tender chicken (or capon). 
Tie a piece of fat pork over the breast. ' Place this in a 
saucepan on a bed of chopped carrot, onion, with 3 cloves, 
I bay-leaf, and a bunch of sweet herbs. Fill | with white 
broth or water, cold. Bring to a rapid boil and skim. Then 
set back on the range where it will cook gently till quite 
tender : 30 minutes or more, according to age and quality of 
the chicken. 

Now make i cjuart of White Sauce (see receipt), using the 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 585 

broth of the chicken, strained. When this is ready, and 
boiling, beat it by degrees into a bowl containing 4 yolks of 
eggs, beaten. Add a few drops of lemon-juice, a very little 
grated nutmeg, salt, and i tablespoonful of juice of stewed 
mushrooms and a small lump of fresh butter. Return the 
sauce to the fire, stirring constantly. When hot add 5 leaves 
of gelatine, previously washed in cold water and well drained. 
Or you may use the box-gelatine, about i ounce ; but the 
latter must be previously soaked in cold broth. (The French 
leaf-gelatine need only be washed, and dissolves quickly 
when hot. It is to be found in most good grocery-shops, 
and the proportions for plain jelly are: in winter, 12 leaves 
to the quart, and in summer even 14.) When the gelatine is 
dissolved, strain the sauce through a fine strainer into a bowl, 
and set away to cool. When almost cold beat in ^ pint of 
whipped cream — no liquid. Set aside where it will cool but 
not harden. Prepare also a little plain, clear, pale jelly, 
using the proportions as for ordinary jelly. Set this also to 
cool, but not harden. Prepare also a large, flat platter, or 
dish, sprinkling over the entire surface little drops of good 
sweet oil, which is to prevent sticking. 

Now cut up your chicken in neat pieces, large enough to 
serve i piece to each person. Dip each piece in the cold, 
thick sauce, being Very careful to cover all sides, and lay 
each piece on the oiled dish in such manner as not to touch 
its neighbor. Set in a cold place to harden. Now see 
that each piece is really perfectly coated, and if not, repair 
with more sauce, which must have been kept, meanwhile, 
where it remains cool without hardening. Now, if desired, 
garnish each piece with a slice of truffle. Brush over the 
whole the clear, liquid jelly which you have prepared as 
directed. Harden again in a cold place. This latter gives 
the glaze necessary to perfect the chaud;froid. When the 
pieces are thoroughly firm, pile them in a pyramid on a bed 
of crumbed clear jelly. Garnish to taste with crumbed jelly, 
or dice of same, truffles, parsley, lemon, beet, etc. 

This detailed pr9cess serves for every dish of chaud-froid

which is to be white. There is also a brown sort used for 
dark game, etc., which see below. 

CHAUD-FROID OF PARTRIDGE PIE. 
CHAUD-FROID DE PERDREAUX A LA PRINCE ALBERT. 

For this dish procure a terrine of Pat6 de Perdreaux, 
which is well put up by Henry of Strasburg. There are 
also good ones in tins. Take the pSt^ out of the terrine or 
tin, remove all the fat from all sides, and cut the pSt6 in 
slices about \ an inch thick and of even size. For this dish 
you will require two sauces, the white as in preceding re- 
ceipt, and the brown as follows: Prepare a strong, brown 
broth, which boil down until concentrated, to which you add 
any dark, strong juice of roasted meat, veal or beef, and 
even, if necessary, some Liebig's Extract of Beef. The 
point is to have it quite dark brown and of a good strong 
meat-flavor. To this add gelatine in the proportion of lo 
or 12 leaves to the quart. You have meanwhile prepared 
the White Sauce. When the Brown Sauce is also perfectly 
cold, but not hard, dip each slice of the pStd in the White 
Sauce, carefully coating all the surfaces, and place on an 
oiled dish. Set on ice till quite firm, placing on each piece, 
when coated with both sauces, a neat slice of trufifle or of 
white of hard-boiled egg cut in a design. When firm dip 
each slice in the Brown Sauce, which must be on the point 
of hardening. Set away again to harden. Each slice must 
be entirely covered on all sides with both sauces. When 
perfectly firm, brush over with the light broth-jelly, which 
serves to give the finishing glaze. Arrange in a circle on a 
bed of crumbed jelly ; garnish prettily, and serve with a fine 
salad, such as that of lettuce-hearts. (See receipt.) 

A BASKET OF CHERRIES. 

Take a terrine or tin of some fine French game-pat6. Re- 
move the fat from the surface ; chill the pSti well and cut it 
in round balls with the knife made for potato-balls. Have 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 587 

ready a brown chaud-froid sauce, as described for Partridge 
P,ie. Also prepare a light broth jelly and an oiled dish. 
The process is the same. Having coated the balls on all 
sides, place them on the dish to harden. When quite firm, 
dip them a second time in the same brown sauce. When 
quite firm brush over with the glazing-broth jelly. Mean- 
while take as many small paper cases as you have " cher- 
ries." Fill the bottom of each to the depth of \ i"ch. When 
firm, place in each a "cherry," filling the space between it 
and the sides of the case with crumbed jelly. Have ready a 
round dish which will fit in a pretty basket. On the dish 
put a bed of crumbed jelly. Arrange the " cherries " on 
this and serve in the basket, tastefully garnished with green 
leaves — cherry leaves, if possible. 

LOBSTER FILETS 2 LITALIENNE. 
FILETS DE HOMARD, ETC. 

Boil a fair-sized lobster in salted boiling water. Let it 
cool in the same water. Prepare a thick Mayonnaise Sauce, 
to which add, for i quart of sauce, 5 or 6 leaves of gelatine 
which have been washed and melted in a little hot wine 
vinegar. Have ready also an evenly-sliced trufHe and some 
light broth-jelly (or fish-broth jelly, if preferred). 

When the lobster is quite cold and thoroughly drained 
from all water, take a pair of scissors and cut off the shell 
from the upper surface of the tail. Remove the meat en- 
tire. Take out the vein, as usual. Cut the tail in neat, 
even J-inch slices. Dip these in the mayonnaise jelly and 
place them on an oiled dish to harden, laying a slice of truffle 
on each slice of lobster. When quite firm, brush over with 
the glazing-broth, and set away again till perfectly firm. 

Meanwhile cut from a large loaf all the crust, leaving the 
bread 2 or 3 inches thick. Place it on a dish, and on this 
arrange the lobster, at full length, and as flat as possible, 
placing the little claws along the sides as a garnish (the large 
claws sliced may also be served in jelly). Now fill the 



588 GOOD-LIVING. 

open, hollow shell of the tail with Italian Salad (see receipt). 
When ready to serve, place the jellied slices of lobster neatly 
and carefully along the back, on top of the salad. Serve. 

JELLIED SHRIMPS. 

ASPIC DE CREVETTES. 

Prepare about i quart of good and well-seasoned fish-jelly, 
using some delicate sea-fish for the purpose. The fish-broth 
should boil with \ bay-leaf, a few spices, a bunch of celery- 
leaves, parsley, a sprig of thyme, onion, a few pepper-corns, 
and some salt. Clear the broth before adding the gelatine. 
Strain through a bit of finest muslin. Add a little white 
wine or madeira. Now take a round, smooth mould, rinse 
in cold water, and pour in fish-jelly \ an inch deep. Set 
away to harden. Then place on this, as your taste may 
guide you, vegetables such as green peas, truffles cut in dice, 
carrots, green beans, capers, cauliflower, previously boiled and 
chilled. To be more sure of their remaining in place, pick 
up each, by the aid of a coarse needle, and dip it in the 
liquid jelly before placing it. When arranged, pour in jelly 
to cover and set again to harden (on ice is the quickest). 
Now fill the rest of the mould to the top with shelled fresh 
shrimps, which have been boiled in salt water and chilled. 
Over this pour the fish-jelly until every space is filled. Set 
away to harden. Serve garnished with crumbed jelly, 
parsley, lemon, etc., and at the same time serve a Sauce 
Emmanuel. 

CHICKEN MA YONNAISE WITH TOM A TO JELL Y. 

Skin, cut in pieces, and stew gently for at least an hour 
enough fresh tomatoes to equal nearly i quart of liquid. 
With the tomatoes put 2 shallots chopped and slightly fried 
in very little butter, I small bay-leaf, a sprig of thyme, 2 
cloves, a good bunch of parsley, some celery leaves, l small 
teaspoonful of butter and i lump of sugar. When well 
cooked, press through a sieve all the liquor and pulp of the 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 589 

tomatoes. Of this take \\ pt. and add to it while boiling 2 
oz. of gelatine which has previously been soaked in \ pt. of 
strong meat broth. If not very strong, add some Liebig's 
Extract. Stir ovfcr the fire until the gelatine is quite dis- 
solved ; set aside to cool. Add i teaspoonful of madeira. 
Have ready a i -quart border-mould of earthenware or china — 
not metal. Fill the border-mould with the tomato-pur^e, 
when it is cool enough, and set away to harden. Note that 
in hot weather a larger proportion of gelatine is required 
for all jellies, but the average is given in these receipts. 

Meanwhile have ready a fine, tender chicken which has 
been stewed or boiled whole. When it is very cold, remove 
the skin and cut it in good pieces from the bones, say 2x3 
inches. Make a thick Mayonnaise Sauce ; coat the pieces 
of chicken thoroughly; sprinkle them with finely-chopped 
parsley and tarragon. Turn the tomato-jelly out on a round 
dish ; garnish it prettily. Pile the pieces of chicken neatly 
in the centre and serve very cold. As garnish may be 
recommended pale, well-crisped lettuce-leaves. Mayonnaise 
may also be served in a sauceboat at same time. 

VEGETABLE SALAD. 
SALADE DE LEGUMES. 

Carrots, turnips, potatoes cut in balls, boiled in salted 
boiling water, and chilled. Peas, green beans, flageolet 
beans, beets sliced, and a young cauliflower, boiled and 
chilled. Drain all quite dry. Remove the coarse stem from 
the cauliflower without breaking it. Place the cauliflower 
in the middle of the large salad bowl, or round, deep dish. 
Then place in little heaps, alternating tastefully the colors, 
all the other vegetables. Over the whole pour quite half a 
teacupful of Plain French Dressing (see receipt). Sprinkle 
the whole thickly with finest chopped parsley, chervil, and 
tarragon. Serve at the same time in a sauceboat some of 
the same salad-dressing. 



590 GOOD-LIVING. 

ITALIAN SALAD. 

SALADE ITALIENNE. 

Use the same vegetables, prepared as above, but separate 
the cauliflower in small pieces. Add anchovies, sliced truf- 
fles, hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters, and hearts of young, 
well-bleached lettuce, also quartered. Set aside the eggs 
and lettuce-hearts. Dress all the other ingredients with Plain 
French Dressing, mixing in even a few spoonfuls of mayon- 
naise. Mix all thoroughly. Garnish with the lettuce-hearts 
and eggs. Sprinkle thickly with finest chopped parsley, 
chervil, and tarragon, and serve. This is the salad used in 
receipt for Lobster Filets a' ITtalienne. 

A DELICIOUS LETTUCE SALAD 

is made of the palest bleached Boston lettuce, using the 
hearts only, well crisped and drained and carefully mixed with 
thick mayonnaise in such a way as not to crush or wilt the 
lettuce, to keep each quarter clearly, separated, and no liquid 
sauce between the pieces, which must be piled neatly in the 
salad-bowl. 

SAUCE MOUSSELINE. 

Mix together in a saucepan i tablespoonful of butter with 
2 of flour. Stir it over the fire, then set it back, stirring 
occasionally, and being very careful not to let it brown. Let 
stand 45 minutes in this way. Then stir in slowly boiling 
pale broth (fish or meat, according to what may be required) 
until of the consistency of cream. After boiling and stirring 
for a few minutes, move it aside and let it settle, then skim 
off any butter that may have risen to the top. Now beat 
together in a bowl the yolks of 2 or 3 eggs. Then strain the 
sauce through a very fine sieve, or even a piece of muslin, 
and return to the fire in a clean saucepan. Bring to a boil, 
and then beat the sauce gradually into the bowl of eggs. 



SUFPLEMSINTARY RECEIPTS. 59! 

Add a few drops of lemon-juice. Set on the fire until it 
boils up once, but be very careful not to let the egg harden. 
Add a lump of fresh butter the size of a hickory-nut. Then 
beat it hard with an egg-beater, and serve at once. This is 
to be served with asparagus, boiled artichokes, boiled fish, etc. 

SA UCE EMMANUEL. 

Make a mayonnaise into which you have worked a salt- 
spoonful of mustard, mixed beforehand ; or a Mustard 
Dressing (see receipt). Into this stir, chopped as fine as 
powder, and mixed together, tarragon, parsley, fine celery 
leaves, chervil, chives in sufficient quantity to make the 
sauce quite green. The flavor of tarragon may predominate 
slightly. Add 2 or 3 drops of tabasco, and a little lemon- 
juice. 

EGGS, SOUBISE STYLE. 

CEUFS A LA SOUBISE. 

Peel 8 white onions and cut them in small pieces. Put 
them in a stewpan with a large tablespoon ful of fresh 
butter. Let them become gold color, then cover and place 
where the onions will continue to stew gently without 
further browning, until perfectly tender, perhaps 45 min- 
utes to I hour. Now boil hard 6 or 8 eggs. Shell, cut in 
quarters, and keep warm without further hardening. When 
the onions are done, add salt, pepper, a few drops of vine- 
gar, and a little chopped parsley. Beat together i or 2 raw 
eggs. Pour the boiling onion purde on these and beat till 
well mixed. Return to the fire and stir constantly for i or 2 
minutes. Pour this over the eggs, garnish with bits of toast, 
and serve. 

EGGS STUFFED WITH ANCHOVIES. 

Boil 6 eggs hard. Lay in cold water, then remove the 
shells. Cut in half, lengthwise, and arrange on a flat dish. 
Now take for each half-egg i anchovy. Wash ; remove 



592 GOOD-LIVING. 

head and back-bone, and pound fine in a mortar, or chop as 
fine as possible. To this paste add the yolks of the hard 
eggs and a large lump of very fresh butter. Rub all to- 
gether to a perfectly smooth paste. With this fill the half- 
whites, garnish with parsley, and serve cold. Or keep the 
whites warm while you put the above paste, to which 
you have added i whole raw egg and enough fine white 
crumbs to thicken a little more, on the fire. Then fill with 
it the half whites and serve hot, with or without an anchovy 
sauce. 

EGGS A LA CHIPOLA TA. 

Break 6 whole eggs into a bowl and beat slightly with 
2 tablespoonfuls of rich cream. Have all ready heated 
a little rich Brown Sauce well seasoned and strong with 
meat-juice, in which you have put cold ham, tongue, cooked 
mushrooms and trufHes, all cut in fine shreds or little strips. 
These must be mixed with just enough of the sauce to 
moisten without making the mixture liquid. Put a 
piece of fresh butter in a round-bottomed saucepan, and, 
when hot, pour in the beaten eggs, and stir unceasingly, 
always scraping from the bottom of the saucepan the eggs 
before they have time to become hard arid coarse. When 
nearly done, stir in the above ham and tongue mixture. 
Mix thoroughly and serve immediately in a deep dish. 
Garnish with croutons and cover tightly. With this may 
be served a little of the sauqe used in the ham mixture, 
with chopped mushrooms and trufHes. 

EGGS STUFFED WITH CHICKEN. 

Prepare as for eggs stuffed with anchovies, substituting 
cold minced chicken for the anchovies, and working into 
paste some thick tomato pur6e. If served hot, add a raw 
egg and a few bread-crumbs to the paste before heating, and 
serve at the same time a Tomato Sauce ; or if served cold, a 
mayonnaise of lettuce-hearts quartered. 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 593 

TRUFFLED EGGS. 

Prepare the same paste as for eggs stuffed with anchovies, 
but with only ^ the quantity of anchovies, chopped truffles, 
mushrooms, a little fine white bread-crumbs,' i egg. Serve 
hot. 

LYONNAISE OMELETTE. 

Peel and cut fine i large white onion. Stew it in a table- 
spoonful of butter until quite tender, and golden brown — 
not crisped. Break in a bowl 6 eggs. Beat until mixed, 
then beat in the onion and fry as usual, leaving the centre 
always a little soft. Fold over and serve quickly. 

HASTY PUDDING, ITALIAN FASHION. 

Prepare plain boiled mush of Indian meal. When well- 
boiled and thick, spread it out on a flat dish and set away 
to cool and harden. Then cut in diamond-shaped pieces ; 
dip in egg and grated cheese, and fry in hot butter until 
slightly browned. Serve very hot for luncheon. 

FINE PANCAKES. 

To I egg allow 3 even tablespoonfuls of sifted flour. 
Beat well together. Add enough milk to make a very 
liquid batter, also a pinch of salt. Heat a very smooth 
frying-pan which has a low edge. Grease this with a very 
little melted butter. When hot, pour in just enough batter 
to cover. As soon as this sets, turn over quickly. Roll up 
with jam, jelly, or cinnamon and sugar. These may also be 
filled with a delicately-flavored soft custard, and are then 
called " kla Celestin," and make a very dainty sweet-dish. 

APPLE PANCAKES. 

Pare, slice thin, scald, and dry thoroughly some cored 
cooking-apples. Make a batter as above, only less liquid. 
Mix in the apples. Fry in very little butter ; roll, sprinkle 
with sugar, and serve very hot. 



594 GOOD-LIVING. 

SOUFFL& OF CAULIFLOWER. 

SOUFFLlfi DE CHOUFLEUR. 

Take a small cauliflower weighing a little less than I lb. 
After cleaning it, let it lie in cold water and vinegar for 
quite 15 minutes. Drain and boil in salted boiling water 
for 15 minutes. Drain very thoroughly, and press through 
a fine sieve. Meanwhile butter thickly the inner walls of a 
mould, and then dredge flour over this butter, coating all 
sides and bottom evenly. Now put 2 oz. of butter with 
2\ oz. of flour in a small saucepan and stir together over the 
fire without browning. Then add gradually about i cupful of 
boiling milk. Add salt ; boil 5 minutes, stirring constantly. 
Now add the pur^e of cauliflower which you have prepared. 
Beat together perfectly dry the- whites of 5 eggs. The 5 
yolks to be beaten first into the mixture ; the whites at the 
very last, and lightly. Pour this into the mould and bake 
^ hour in the oven, covering with a buttered paper if it 
browns too quickly. The sauce to be served with this is 
made like White Sauce, using some of the water in which 
the cauliflower has boiled to blend it, and adding at the last 
moment, when removed from the fire, \ cupful of whipped 
cream. Turn out the souffle in a hot dish and serve the 
sauce in a sauceboat. 

CARROT CROQUETTES. 

Scrape and boil some fine young carrots. Boil till about 
half done, then drain dry, and grate them. Add enough 
thick Cream Sauce to bind the pur^e together, also i egg to 
each cupful of the mixture, sugar and salt to taste. Set away. 
When quite firm, form into croquettes, dip in egg, and fine 
breadcrumbs, repeating the dipping if neccessary. Fry in 
deep boiling lard, and serve with a bunch of fried parsley. 
The same may also be sliced when cold, dressed, and served 
with lettuce salad. 

NEW BAKED POTATOES. 
Choose large potatoes, the roundest in form. Bake in the 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. 59S 

oven, pressing frequently with a cloth, t.o make the interior 
fine and mealy. When done, cut carefully in half. Scoop 
out the interior; mix with a large lump of very fresh butter, 
pepper, salt, a little thick cream and grated parmesan and 
gruyfere cheese. With 'this fill the shells, making a hollow 
in the centre of each. In this hollow break carefully a fresh 
egg. Place these in the oven till the egg is almost firm, and 
serve quickly. 

POTATO CAKES. 

Peel and grate some raw potatoes, putting the pulp thus 
made on a sieve to drain off all the liquid. To this purde 
add egg and flour enough for quite a thick batter. .Add a 
pinch of salt, sugar, and a little grated lemon-peel. Fry in 
little cakes in hot butter, browning lightly on both sides. 
Serve very hot. 

AUGUSTA TART. 

Put on the ice \ lb. of finest butter. Sift \ lb. of flour. 
When the butter is well chilled, put the flour in a heap on 
the pastry-board (or, better, on a marble slab). Make a hole 
in the centre of the flour and pouf in i sherry-glass of ice- 
water. Work these well together. Then put in the entire 
\ lb. of butter. Fold the paste over it. Now roll out and fold 
over the paste 7 (seven) times. Then fold once more and 
set away in a cold place for at least 6 hours, but better still 
until the following day. Then roll the paste out thin, and 
cut to the size of a flat, round tin bakepan — without any 
edge is best. Lay the layer of paste on the tin and prick it 
lightly all over the surface with a fork. Again set away in 
a cold place for at least lo minutes until thoroughly chilled. 
There should be several layers thus prepared. To bake 
them, place in a moderate oven ; if blisters form, prick them 
with a fork. If the paste shrinks from the edges of the tin, 
draw it carefully back in shape with a fork. The essential 
points are to thoroughly chill the materials, and to set aside 
^fter each handling ; also to ma>e the paste in the early 



596 GOOD-LIVING. 

morning if required for evening dinner, or the day before if 
required for earlier use. Roll always away from you, and 
not too heavily. Also do not use extra flour for the rolling 
out. It should not be necessary with all the materials well 
chilled, but in case of need, reserve a portion of the ^ lb. 
allowance. 

As each layer is baked a delicate gold color turn it out 
from the tin and let it cool absolutely, before touching. The 
remaining bits of paste must be rolled out and cut into leaves 
or crescents and baked, for use in trimming the tart. 

When all is ready, place a layer of the pastry on a round 
dish and cover with a layer of fine jam; on this another layer 
of pastry, then jam, until all the pastry is in place, the top 
finishing with the pastiy. Around the edges place the leaves 
or crescents you have prepared, dipping each on the under ' 
side in a sticky paste of white of egg and sugar. This will 
dry and keep the ornamentation in good shape. The tart 
may be varied by using two different jams or jellies between 
the layers, care being taken to combine such as will blend 
well together. 

The above receipt is wonderfully successful and unvarying, 
and the process seems to do away entirely with the capricious- 
ness of puff-paste prepared in the ordinary way. It is very 
light, flaky, and brittle, in fact most excellent. 

ALMOND CUSTARD. 

I quart of milk, boiled, 6 or 8 yolks of eggs, 4 whites, 

\ pound sweet almonds. Granulated sugar to taste, 

4 bitter almonds, Macaroons, apricot jam. 

Peel the almonds and pound fine in a mortar. Beat the 
eggs in a bowl. When the milk is boiling, pour it on the 
eggs, beating constantly. Sweeten to taste. Add the al- 
monds. Strain out any lumps. Return to the fire and stir 
till thick, being careful not to cook quickly or it will curdle. 
Line a glass dish with macaroons spread with jam. When 
cool, pour the custard into the dish, and serve icy-cold. 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECEIPTS. S97 

STREUBELING {AUSTRIAN). 

Take 2 ounces of butter, \ pint of milk, a pinch of salt, and 
heat all together till the butter melts, but do not boil. Into 
this lukewarm milk work enough sifted flour to make light 
batter, with the yolks of 2 or 3 eggs. Beat the whites to a- 
stiff froth and work them into the batter. The batter should 
now be like a very thick cream. Now have ready on the fire 
a deep frying-pan of boiling lard. Put the batter in a pitcher 
or other vessel from which you can pour it in a small but 
steady stream. First pour it in even, unbroken lines across 
the bottom of the pan with a slight space between each row, 
to allow for the batter to swell. Then put a series of the 
same rows in the opposite direction and over the first, so that 
the paste forms a gridiron, as it were. As soon as you see 
the under layer begin to get firm, turn the whole thing, both 
layers together, so that what is least cooked is now at the 
bottom, and when all are firm, and golden brown, remove 
from the fat all in one piece ; drain thoroughly, sift powdered 
sugar over, and eat hot. The texture when done should bfe 
very crisp and light — something like fresh-baked old-fash- 
ioned crullers. It is most delicious, and although it may be 
a little difficult to fry neatly in shape, practice will soon make 
it easy — and it is well worth the trouble. 




CHAFING-DISH RECEIPTS. 

Note. — In the chapter on " Savory Rehshes " will be 
found some receipts which may also be used for the chafing- 
dish. The chapter on " Eggs " will also contribute several. 

WELSH-RAREBIT. 

3 cups of cheese, i yolk of egg, 

Worcestershire Sauce, Cayenne, salt. 

Butter the size of a walnut, Beer, ale, or porter. 

Melt the butter with the seasonings. Put in the cheese 
and stir until beginning to melt, adding by degrees beer, 
ale, or porter (former preferred), about a gill, according as 
required. When the cheese is melted, stir in quickly the 
yolk of egg, and serve immediately on buttered toast. 
American cheese is best for this purpose. 

CREAMED LOBSTER. 

Cut cold boiled lobster in pieces. Put a large lump of 
butter in the chafing-dish, add salt, cayenne, and \ a cup 
of cream. When the butter is melted, lay in the lobster 
with all its fat. Stir the fat and cream together, cover, when 
boiling, stir in ^ a teaspoonful of cornstarch blended with 2 
tablespoonfuls of cream, and stir about 2 minutes. Then 
add I or 2 tablespoonfuls of .sherry and serve. 

SARDINES WITH ANCHOVY BUTTER. 

Melt I tablespoonful of butter in the chafing-dish with 
about a level teaspoonful of anchovy-paste. When melted, 

598 



CHAFING-DISH RECEIPTS. 599 

remove the skins from some boneless sardines and lay them 
in the butter for 3 oir 4 minutes, basting them meanwhile 
with the butter. Lay them on thin slices of hot toast, and 
cover with the butter. If liked, the chafing-dish may be 
rubbed with a clove of garlic cut open, before putting in the 
butter. 

STEWED OYSTERS. 

25 oysters and their liquor, Butter the size of a walnut, 

I teaspoon of cornstarch, Milk, 

Salt, pepper, nutmeg or mace. 

Put the butter into the chafing-dish. Strain the liquor 
from the oysters. When the butter is melted, add the 
liquor. When this boils, put in the oysters. Mix the corn- 
starch with just enough milk to blend it thoroughly, about 
^ of a cup. When the beards of the oysters have begun to 
curl, and they are boiling briskly, stir in the blending. Con- 
tinue to stir for about 2 minutes, adding salt, pepper, a very 
small pinch of nutmeg or mace, or a little celery-salt and 2 
teaspoonfuls of sherry wine. 

SOFT CLAMS STEWED. 

In the spring these are at their best. Obtain, if possible, 
soft clams that are opened expressly, and the juice saved. 
Those that are tied in bunches and sold at the fish markets 
are a poor substitute. Strain the juice into the chafing-dish. 
Add a large lump of butter, pepper, and salt, and bring to 
a boil. Then put in the clams whole and stew gently until 
almost firm. Blend together some cornstarch and milk, 
allowing about i teaspoonful of cornstarch and -^ of a cup of 
rich milk to a pint of stew. Bring the stew to a brisk boil 
and stir in the blending. Boil and stir for about 2 minutes 
until smooth and slightly thickened and serve immediately. 
A very small pinch of nutmeg or mace may be added, 
according to taste. 

FRESH MUSHROOMS STEWED.. 

Remove the skins from the tops and scrape the stalks of 



6oo GOOD-LIVING. 

the mushrooms. Cut the stalks in small pieces and leave 
the tops whole, if very young. The larger ones should be 
cut to a uniform size that they may cook evenly. As they 
are prepared throw them into a bowl of cold water in which 
there is about i tablespoonful of vinegar to a quart of water. 
Let them stand 15 or 20 minutes. Now put a large table- 
spoonful of butter (for a quart bowl full of mushrooms) into 
the chafing-dish, also a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful 
of Worcestershire Sauce. When the butter is melted, lift 
the mushrooms out of the water, not draining them. Mix 
them well with the butter and seasonings, then cover them 
and allow to stew, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or 
more, until they lose their crispness and become a little 
tender. Too much cooking destroys their flavor. Blend 
together a teaspoonful of cornstarch and about 2 table- 
spoonfuls of cream. Stir this into the boiling mushrooms 
and continue to stir for about 2 minutes until the sauce is 
smooth and the cornstarch thoroughly cooked. Serve on 
toast. The above receipt is very simple but gives the full 
flavor of the mushrooms. 

MINCED VEAL. 

Cold veal cut in dice, Lemon juice, 

Cold ham cut in dice, Worcestershire Sauce, 

Meat jelly or strong stock, Mushrooms, canned or fresh. 

Heat about a cupful of jelly or stock, add the meat, season- 
ings, and mushrooms. When thoroughly heated and boil- 
ing, add a teaspoonful of cornstarch blended with a little 
cold stock, and stir for about 2 minutes, until smooth and 
slightly thickened. Serve on toast. 

CREAM OF CHICKEN. 

Cold chicken cut in small pieces, ' Cup of milk, 

Butter the size of a walnut, Seasoning, ' 

Flour, twice the bulk of the butter, i teaspoon of chopped parsley. 

Melt the butter ; add the milk, reserving a little to blend 
the flour. When the milk boils, stir in the blended flour, 



CHAFTNC-DISH RECEIPTS. 6oi 

and continue to stir until quite smooth. Add the chicken, 
and stir to prevent scorching, until the chicken is thoroughly 
heated. Then add the seasonings and chopped parsley and 
serve on toast. 

Cream of turkey, or veal, or lamb may be made in the 
same way, except that the meats are better minced. 

CHICKEN WITH ARTICHOKES. 

Pieces of cold chicken, i cup of meat jelly or strong chicken broth, 

Lemon juice, Salt and pepper, 

I small can of Fonds d'Artichauts, i teaspoon of Worcestershire Sauce. 

Heat the chicken-broth, reserving a little with which to 
make the blending later. Add seasonings. Lay in the 
pieces of chicken, then aftpr a minute or two, the artichokes. 
Cover and heat thoroughly. When boiling, stir in f of a 
teaspoonful of cornstarch blended with some of the cold 
broth. Stir for about 2 minutes and serve. 

CHICKEN WITH GREEN PEAS, 

CHICKEN WITH MAC&DOINE OF VEGETABLES. 

may both be prepared exactly as above, substituting canned 
or fresh peas, or canned macddoine. These canned vegeta- 
bles should be drained and washed through with cold water 
before using. 

DUCK AND OLIVES. 

Cold duck cut in pieces. Seasonings, 

I cup of meat jelly or strong stock. Sherry, 
^ cup of pitted olives. Cornstarch. 

Heat the stock, reserving a little to blend the cornstarch. 
Add 2 tablespoonfuls of sherry and a teaspoonful of Wor- 
cestershire Sauce and salt. Lay in the pieces of duck, then 
the olives. When thoroughly heated and the sauce boils, 
add I teaspoonful of cornstarch blended with some of the 
cold stock. Stir and boil about 2 minutes and serve. 



6o2 GOOD-LIVING. 

QUAIL AND OTHER SMALL BIRDS 

may be dressed in the same manner as Duck and Olives, 
using mushrooms or olives, or the sauce alone, according to 
taste. 

, SWEETBREADS. 

These may be dressed according to receipt for Fricasseed 
Eggs, or with the sauce given for Duck and Olives, using in 
that case mushrooms in place of the olives, or they may be 
prepared as follows : Having had the sweetbreads thoroughly 
boiled beforehand, and strings and fibres removed, lay them 
in the chafing-dish whole with a large lump of butter and a 
few bits of bacon. Turn them in the butter until slightly 
browned. Baste then generously with sherry wine. Now 
add 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of very strong stock or meat jelly, 
also salt and pepper. When the sauce boils, stir in a little 
blending — about \ a teaspoonful of cornstarch dissolved in 
about a tablespoonful of cold stock. The blending, how- 
ever, is not absolutely necessary. Serve with the bits of 
bacon. 

VENISON WITH fELLY SAUCE. 

Put into the chafing-dish equal quantities of currant jelly, 
butter, and port wine or claret. When the jelly is melted, 
add salt and pepper generously. Lay in slices of cold veni- 
son, underdone. Turn the slices. A little blending of ^ a 
teaspoonful of cornstarch and wine may be added when the 
meat is hot and the sauce boiling. Stir and boil for about 2 
minutes, then serve. 

PORK TENDERLOINS. 

These, prepared according to receipt for Venison with 
Jelly Sauce, are highly recommended. The tenderloins 
should be cooked beforehand, either broiled or done in a

Each, ibrno. Cloth. Net,' $1.00 

No more unique or 'V7elcome gift for a brain-fagged 
house-wife can be imagined than this little series of 
handbooks in their quaint plaid gingham covers, com- 
prising any number of tried recipes. 

I. What to Have for Breakfast 

*^ One might conscientipusly use a number of enthusiastic adjectives 
about Olive Green's Guide to the Cheerful Life. It is a small book, 
but any one who looks it over can find a hundred reasons for owning it, 
andf failing to publish it, the board of Home Missions lost an opportu- 
nity."— i(/%.iV. Y. 

" One of the sanest brochures on the food question yet published." — 
N* V, Evening Mail, 

**Whoever follows its laws will brine peace to her household and 
kindly fame to herself. It is the best book in all the world with which 
to start the fresh day, and an intelligent application oi its rules may set 
in motion the very springs of heroism, joy and achievement." — Chicago 
Tribune, 

II. Everyday Luncheons 

**Here are 365 menus, one for every day in the year, besides a variety 
of recipes that have a toothsome aspect in print and have not been found 
wanting in practice, as we are assured. There are some introductory 
words on ^Luncheons, Wise and Foolish,' which contain sound philoso- 
phy with a coating or humor," — Pittsburg Gazette. 

*'A helpful companion for any woman seeking to vary her menus. The 
recipes are ecohomical in many cases new, and in all cases practical." — 
The Con£regationalist, 

III. One Thousand Simple Soups 

**Its information is all practical and every recipe contained within its 
covers is well worth trying. It will prove a valuable addition to the 
domestic shelf of any housewife whether she be her own cook or not." — 
Newark A dvertiser. 

*'The recipes are well-classed and are distinctly good. The neat lit- 
tle volume deserves a prominent place upon the kitchen slielf." — Chicago 
Hecord-Herald. ,

in character but universally tempting, follow, with blank pages for new 
ones. Here is a delightful gift for the chafing-dish expert or the dainty 
housekeeper." — Chicago Recordr-Herald, 

** The directions are so full and explicit that they will commend the 
book to any housekeeper."— -^am Francisco Chronicle, 

** The book is very cleverly written and contains many good things 
besides the recipes." — Burlington Free Press, 

" It is well worth the attention of every housewife." — Boston Times. 

V. How to Cook Fish

may always be relied upon in every way." — Promdence Journal.
