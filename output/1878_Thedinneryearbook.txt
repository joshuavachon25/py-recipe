" Do not laugh when I tell you that one of the most 
serious perplexities of my eveiy-day life is the daily recur- 
ring question, ' What shall we have for dinner ? ' " writes 
a correspondent. 

I do not smile at the naive confession. I feel more 
like sighing as I recollect the years during the summers 
and winters of which the same query advanced with me 
into the dignity of a problem. There were several im- 
portant ends to be compassed in the successful settle- 
ment of the question. To accomplish an agreeable vari- 
ety in the family bill of fare ; to accommodate appetites 
and individual preferences to the season and state of the 
local market ; to avoid incongruous associations of meats, 
vegetables, sauces, entries and desserts ; to build frag- 
ments into a structure about which should linger no flavor 
of staleness or sameness ; so to manage a long succession 
of meals that yesterday's repast and the more frugal one 
of to-day should not suggest the alternation of fat and lean 
in the Hibernian's pork, or the dutiful following of pen- 
ance upon indulgence ; to shun, with equal care, the rock 
of parsimony and the whirlpool of extravagance ; — but why 
extend the list of dilemmas ? Are they not written in the 
mental chronicles of every housewife whose conscience- 
be her purse shallow or deep — will not excuse her from a 
continual struggle with the left-overs ? Such uncompro- 



2 FAMILIAR TALK. 

mising bits of facts do these same "left-overs " appear in 
the next day's survey of ways, means, and capabilities, 
that timid mistresses are the less to blame for often wink- 
ing at the Alexandrine audacity with which the cook has 
disposed of the knotty subject by emptying platters and 
tureens into the swill-pail, — which should stand for the 
armorial bearings of her tribe wherever found, — or satisfied 
indolence, and what goes with her for humanity, by toss- 
ing crusts, bones, and " cold scraps " into the yawning 
basket of the beggar at the basement door. 

One of these days I mean to write an article, scientific 
and practical, "upon the genus, "basket-beggar." For the 
present, take the word of one who has studied the species 
in all its varieties, — who has suffered long, and certainly not 
been ?/«kind in the acquisition of experience upon this 
head, — and prohibit their visits entirely, and at all seasons. 
"Cold cuts" and the "heels" of loaves belong to you as 
certainly as do hot joints and unmufilated pies. Issue 
your declaration of independence to the effect that you 
choose to dispense charity in your own way, and that, 
as an intelligent Christian woman, you can better judge 
by what methods to relieve want and aid the really worthy 
poor, than can the ignorant, irresponsible creature who 
lavishes what . costs her nothing upon every chance spe- 
culator whose lying whine excites her pity. Sympathy 
which, by the way, would generally lie dormant, were the 
listener to the piteous tale obliged to satisfy the peti- 
tioner from her own purse or wardrobe. 

Returning from what is not, although it may seem to 
be a digression, let us talk together more briefly than is 
our wont in these familiar conferences, of the considera- 
tions that have moved and sustained me in the prepara- 
tion of this volume, and which will, I hope, make it a 
welcome and useful counsellor to you. First, then, the 



FAMILIAR TALK. 3 

suggestion and interrogation of sincere seekers for help- 
ful advice pertaining to that most important of the triad 
of daily meals — " The Family Dinner," superadded to 
my own observation and experience of the difficulties 
that beset the subject. Secondly, the discovery, that so 
far as I have been able to push my investigations — and 
my searching has been keen and extensive — no directory 
upon this particular branch of culinary endeavor has been 
pubUshed, at least none in the English language. We 
have had books, some of them admirable helps to skilful, 
no less than to inexperienced housekeepers, upon dinner- 
giving, and company dinners, and " little diniTer " parties, 
not to refer to the mighty- mountain of manuals upon 
cookery in general ; but, up to the time of the present 
writing, I have found nothing that, to my appreciation, 
meets the case stated by the friend whose plaint heads this 
chapter. 

My aim has been to write out, for seven days of four 
weeks in each month, a menu adapted, in all things, to 
the average American market ; giving meats, fish, vegeta- 
bles, and fruits in their season, and, so far as I could do so 
upon paper, rendering a satisfactory account of t^vsry 
pound of meat, etc., brought, by my advice, into the kit- 
chen. I have taken the liberty accorded me by virtue of 
our long and intimate acquaintanceship, of inspecting 
not only the contents of your market-basket, but each 
morning the treasures of larder and refrigerator ; of offering 
counsel concerning crumbs,- bones, and such odds-and- 
ends as are held in contempt by many otherwise thrifty 
managers — to wit, other cold vegetables than potatoes, 
and dry crusts of bread and cake, while of gravy and 
dripping I have made specialties. I have tried, more- 
over, to inspire such respect for made-over dinners, as we 
feel for the pretty rugs made of the ravellings of Axmin- 



4 FAMILIAR TALK. 

ster carpets. We do not attempt to impose them upon 
ourselves or our friends as " pure Persian." But neither 
do we blush for them because Mrs. Million Aire across 
the way would scorn to give them house-room. Let 
" Consistency " be stamped upon every appointment of 
your household, and even the parvenue opposite cannot 
despise you. Once learn the truth that moderate, or 
even scanty means do not make meanness or homeliness a 
necessity, and act upon the lesson, and you can set criti- 
cism at defiance. Apropos to this point of consistency, 
let me say, in explanation, not apology, for the small space 
devoted to dbmpany-dinners, that I have dealt with them 
upon the principle that ten times one makes ten. Hav- 
ing, in emulation of the Eastern beauty, carried the calf 
with ease for four weeks, you will hardly appreciate the 
difference in the weight of the cow you lift upon the fifth. 
In plainer phrase, give John and the children good din- 
ners, well-cooked, and daintily served, every day, and the 
entertainment of half-a-dozen friends in addition to the 
family party will cease to be a stupendous undertaking. 
They have a saying in the Southern States that aptly 
expresses the labor and excitement attendant upon such 
an event in too many families ; the straining after Mrs. 
Million Aire's diners a la Russe, which presuppose the 
despotism of a chef in the kitchen, and the solemn pomp 
of a Chief Butler in the salle d manger. The Southern 
description of the frantic endeavor is — " Trying to put the 
big pot into the little one," and it is invariably used with 
reference to preparations for company. Be content, my 
dear sister, to put into your little pot only so much as it 
will decently hold, and be thankful that you have in it a 
sure gauge of responsibility. 

I have spoken of dinners for four weeks in each month. 
I have written receipts for this number, not in forgetful- 



FAMILIAR TALK. 5 

ness of the fact that there is but one February per annum, 
but because the need of adapting the bills of fare to the 
days of the week, instead of the month, was absolute, and if 
I wished the Dinner Year-Book to be a perpetual calen- 
dar, I inust say nothing of the broken week that some- 
time ends and sometimes begins the month. The diffi- 
culty of disposing satisfactorily of the two or three odd 
days brought to my mind, while blocking out my work, 
the summary manner in which one of my baby-girls once 
dismissed a somewhat analogous difficulty. 

"My dear," I said to her one night as she concluded 
her prayer at my knee, "you have forgotten to pray for 
your little cousins. How did that happen ? Don't you 
want our Heavenly Father to take care of them ? " 

She made a motion of again bending her knees, yawned 
sleepily, and tumbled into bed. 

" Can't help it, mamma ! Baby is too tired ! Horape 
and Eddie must scuffle for themselves just this one night ! " 

I have given you twenty-eight — nay, counting your 
possible company-meal — twenty-nine dinners in succes- 
sion to little purpose if you cannot collate from previous 
receipts one or two for yourself, and be the better for the" 
practice. I need hardly say that I do not anticipate or 
desire slavish adherence to the plan sketched for your day 
or week. I have sketched — that is all — not worked out 
a sum in which addition or subtraction would materially 
affect the sum-total. The framework is, I would fain 
hope, symmetrical. I expect you to build thereupon as 
convenience or discretion may dictate. 



TOUCHING SAUCEPANS. 



®oti£l)tng £iouc£pan0. 

While it is true that the finest tools will not impart 
skill to the untrained workman, it is equally a matter of 
fact that the best artisan is he who cares most jealously 
for the quality and condition of his instruments as well as 
for the finish of his workmanship. 

A visitor once asked permission to witness the opera- 
tion of cooking a beefsteak in my kitchen, saying that her 
husband had spoken in terms of commendation of those 
he had eaten at my table. Like the good wife she was, 
she desired to " catch the trick," whatever it might be, 
of preparing them to his liking. I willingly acceded to 
her request, and upon her return to the parlor her hus- 
band inquired eagerly : " Did you learn the secret ? " 

"Yes," was the smiling answer. "You must buy me a 
gridiron ! " 

Up to that time, she then explained, fried steaks had 
been the rule in her house, and gridirons a thing unheard 
or unthought of. 

A fried beefsteak being, as I have elsewhere stated, a 
culinary solecism, I have, perhaps, selected an extreme 
case as the test of my discourse upon the necessity of a 
supply of fitting utensils for the proper prosecution of 
home-cookery. Mrs. Whitne/s idea of the " art-kitchen," 
so charmingly set forth in " We Girls," may not be so 
chimerical (with limitations) as most practical housewives 
— practised in nothing more than in the exercise of pa- 
tience — are apt to suppose. They tell us the tale — 
known already too sadly well to each of us — of the im- 
possibility Qf inducing "girls" who are tractable and 
respectful in most things, to accept labor-saving machines, 



TOUCHING SAUCEPANS. • 7 

and the thousand-and-one ingenious contrivances for 
making cooking easier and even graceful ; of the hard 
usage to which expensive implements are subjected in 
rude hands, the motive-power of which is the untilled 
brain, unrestrained by the conscienceless will ; of how 
innovations are openly flouted, or secretly sneered at, 
" until," say they, " we find it easier to let the cook have 
her own way down-stairs, and reconcile ourselves, as best 
we may, to obstinate stupidity and unmerciful breakages. 
As to art-kitchens," — a shrug and a groan, — " we are thank- 
ful if our tenderest care can keep the upper stories free 
from the vandalism that rages below." 

Nevertheless, acknowledging, as I have, personally, rea- 
sons for doing — the truth of all these things — I make an- 
swer, " Have an art-kitchen for yourself ! " First, give your 
cook, or maid-of-all-work, a fair trial. It is a duty you owe 
to humanity and to her to prove, conclusively, whether her 
careless or destructive habits be ingrain and wilful, or 
merely the result of ignorance and bad training. There are 
bad mistresses, let us remember, — and more still who are 
indifferent or incompetent. If " our girl " has a heart or & 
conscience, let us find it. Make her understand the value 
and usefulness of the appliances you have furnished for 
her work, where and how they are to be kept, and set her 
the example of always looking for and putting them in 
their proper places. If they are misused, show your re- 
gret decidedly, but still kindly. Should all means of 
civilizing her taste up to your standard fail, make, as I 
have advised, an art-kitchen for your own use. Appro- 
priate one corner of the room, where cooking is done, for 
your operations, and arrange there your pet tools. Have 
your scoop flour-sifter ; your patent pie-lifter and oyster- 
broiler ; your star-toaster ; your pie-crimper, vegetable and 
nutmeg graters ; gravy-strainer, colander, biscuit-cutter. 



8 TOUCHING SAUCEPANS. 

skimmers, larding needles, wire, and perforated, and slit and 
fluted spoons ; your weights and measures, and the tidy, 
serviceable tinned and enamelled saucepans, Scotch kettles, 
frying-pans, etc., that will retain tidiness and serviceable 
qualities so long in your care, and so soon come to grief 
in boorish clutches. Set all these, and as many others as 
you like and can afford to buy — always including the 
Dover egg-beater and its "Baby " (made for whipping one 
egg to more purpose than one egg, or anything else as 
small was ever whipped before) — in array upon walls and 
shelves,* and. let the logic of daily events prove how far 
they will deprive work of the wearing vexations attendant 
upon long searches for the right article, and its wrong 
condition when found. Make your helpers — one and all 
— .comprehend that these are your especial property, to 
be used — and kept clean — by no one else. Let them be 
looked down upon as the toys of a would-be-busy woman 
by the superior intellects about you, should they see fit 
thus to do, and provide such tools as are suited to coarser 
fingers for them to use. The chances are many to one 
that your dexterous manipufation of your instruments ; the 
excellence of the products achieved by yourself and them ; 
even the attractive neatness of the display and your 
corner, will win skeptics, first, to indulgence, then, admir- 
ation, then, to imitation. If you can afford the great 

* It gives me pleasure to state, in this connection, that all of the 
articles named in the above catalogue (and many more) are made 
by the Dover Stamping Company, Boston, Mass., 88 and 90 
North Street. The inventors of the inimitable Egg-Beater have 
proved themselves as, appreciative in other respects of the needs of 
American housewives, and as ingenious in meeting these. I call at- 
tention to their wares, as a simple act of justice to what Is so excel- 
lent in itself, and as an unsolicited thank-offering to the stranger-ben- 
efactors who have made many of my culinary duties a pastime, rather 
than a toil. 



TOUCHING SAUCEPANS. 9 

luxury of a pastry or mixing-room, adjoining the kitchen, 
so much the better for you and your pious undertaking. 
But without regard to what may be the effect upon others, 
have your saucepans, of whatever designs and in whatever 
quantities you Hke — taking " saucepan " as a generic 
term for every description of mute helpers in the task of 
elevating cookery into a fine art, or, at the least, in re- 
deeming it from the stigma of coarseness and vulgarity. 

Have, also, as an indispensable adjunct of saucepans, 
appliances for cleansing them. There is nothing inhe- 
rently degrading in dish-washing. Provide plenty of 
towels and hot water ; a mop with a handle and a loop by 
which to hang it up when it has been squeezed and shaken 
after use ; a soap-shaker — a neat wire cup, enclosing 
the soap, and furnished with a handle of tinned wire, and 
a dish-pan, with a partition running across the middle, 
that the soiled articles may be rinsed from grease in one 
of the compartments before they are purified thoroughly 
in the other. Have, also, at hand a can or box of wash- 
ing soda, and a bottle of ammonia for taking off the grease 
more effectually ; a cake of Indexical silver soap in a cup, 
with a brush, for restoring lustre to tins, Britannia or 
plated, or silver ware. Thus armed, the cleansing of your 
implements will be a matter of brief moment, and your 
work in the kitchen be, in no sense, a hindrance to the 
stated duties of the day, while your methods and occa- 
sional presence cannot fail to be a refining influence upon 
all except the very common and spiritually unclean. 
Ladyhood, if thorough, will assert itself, even behind a 
scullion's apron.

Beef Soup. 
Chicken smothered with Oysters. Celery Salad. 

Mashed Potatoes. Cauliflower au gratin, 

Stewed Tomatoes. 



Blanc Mange and Cream, 

Sponge Cake. 

Cocoa. 



Beef Soup. 

3 lbs. of lean beef, with a marrow-bone. 

•J- lb. lean ham (or a ham-bone, if you have it). 

I turnip. 

I onion. 

1 carrot. 

^ of a cabbage. 

3 stalks of celery. 

3 quarts of water — cold, of course. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 
Cut the meat very fine, and crack the bones well. Put 
these on in a pot with a close top ; cover with a quart of 
water, and set where they will come very slowly to a boil. 
If they do not reach this point in less than an hour, so 
much the better. When the contents of the pot begin 
to bubble, add the remaining two quarts of cold water, 
and let all boil slowly for three hours : for two hours with 
the top closed, during the last with it slightly lifted. 
Wash and peel the turnip, carrot, and onion, scrape the 
celery, and wash with the cabbage. Cut all into dice and 
lay in cold water, a little salted, for half an hour. Put the 
carrot on to stew in a small vessel by itself ; the others 
all together, with enough water to cover them. Some

think the carrot keeps color and shg,pe better if hot, 
instead of cold water be used for it. Let it stew until 
tender, then drain off the water and set it aside to cool. 
The other vegetables should be boiled to pieces. Half 
an hour before the soup is to be taken up, strain the water 
from the cabbage, etc., pressing them to a pulp to extract 
all the strength. Return this to the saucepan, throw in a 
little salt, let it boil up once to clear it ; skim and add to 
the soup. Put in pepper, and salt — unless the ham has 
salted it sufficiently — and boil, covered, twenty minutes. 
Strain into an earthenware basin ; let it get cool enough 
for the fat to arise to the surface, when take off all 
that will come away. Return to the pot, which should 
have been previously rinsed with hot water, boil briskly 
for one minute, and throw in the carrot. Skim and serve. 

This is a good, clear soup. If you like it thicker, dis- 
solve a tablespoonful of gelatine in enough cold water to 
cover it well — this may be done by an hour's soaking — 
and add to the soup after the latter is strained and cleared 
of the fat. 

When practicable, make Sunday's soup on Saturday, 
so far as to prepare the " stock," or meat base. Set it 
away in an earthenware crock, adding a little salt. This 
not only lessens Sunda3''s work, but the unstrained soup 
gathers the whole strength of the meat, and the fat can be 
removed in a solid cake of excellent dripping. Indeed, 
it is a good rule ahvays to prepare soup stock at least 
twenty-four hours before it is to be Used for the table. 

Try, likewise, to make enough soup for Sunday to last 
over Monday as well. A little forethought on Saturday 
will lessen the labors and increase the comfort of what has 
been somewhat profanely named " Job's birthday," the an- 
niversary which was to be accursed for evermore. 

Chicken smothered with Oysters. 
I full-grown, tender chicken. 

1 pint of oysters. 

2 tablespoohfuls of butter. 

3 " " cream. 

I tablespoonful of corn-starch. 
Volks of three hard-boiled eggs. 



FIRST WEEK-SUNDAY. ' 13 

1 scant cup bread-crumbs. 
Pepper, salt, and chopped parsley. 

Prepare the chicken as for roasting. Stuff with a dress- 
ing of the oysters chopped pretty fine, and mixed with the 
bread-crumbs, seasoned to taste with pepper and salt. 
Tie up the neck securely. (This can be done on Satur- 
day, if the fowl be afterwards kept in a very cold place.) 

Put the chicken thus stuffed and trussed, with legs and 
wings tied close to the body with soft tape, into a tin pail 
with a tight top. Cover closely and set, with a weight on 
the top, in a pot of cold water. Bring gradually to a boil, 
that the fowl may be heated evenly and thoroughly. Stew 
steadily, never fast, for an hour and a half after the water 
in the outer kettle begins to boil. Then open the pail 
and test with a fork to see if the chicken be tender. If 
not, re-cover at once, and stew for half or three-quarters 
of an hour longer. When ths chicken is tender through- 
out, take it out and lay upon a hot dish, covering imme- 
diately. Turn the juices left in the paii into a saucepan, 
thicken with the corn-starch, which should first be wet up 
with a little cold milk, then the chopped parsley, butter, 
pepper and salt, and the yolks of the hard-boiled eggs 
chopped fine. Boil up once, stir in the cream, and take 
from the fire before it can boil again. Pour a few spoon- 
fuls over the chicken, and serve the rest in a sauce-tureen. 

Celery Salad. 
2 bunches of celery. 
I tablespoonful of salad oil. 
4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 
I small teaspoonful fine su^ar. 
Pepper and salt to taste. 
Wash and scrape the celery, lay in ice-cold water until 
dinner-time, when cut into inch-lengths, season, tossing 
all well up together, and serve in a salad bowl. 

Cauliflower au gratin. 
I large cauliflower. 
4 tablespoonfuls grated cheese. 
I cup drawn butter. 
Pepper and salt. A pinch of nutmeg. 



14 yANUARY. 

Boil the cauliflower until tender (about twenty minutes), 
having first tied it up in a bag of coarse lace or tarlatan. 
Have ready a cup of good drawn butter, and pour over 
the cauliflower, when you have drained and dished the 
latter. Sift the cheese thickly over the top, and brown by 
holding a red-hot shovel so close to the cheese that it 
singes and blazes. Blow out the fire on the instant, and 
send to the table. 

Mashed Potatoes. 
Pare the potatoes very thin, lay in cold water for an 
hour, and cover well with boiling water. (" Peach-blows" 
are better put down in cold water.) Boil quickly, aiid 
when done, drain off every drop of water ; throw in a little 
salt ; set back on the range for two or three minutes. 
Mash soft with a potato-beetle, or whip to a cream with a 
fork, adding a little butter, and enough milk to make a 
soft paste. Heap in a smooth mound upon a vegetable 
dish. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 
Open a can of tomatoes an hour before cooking them. 
Leave out the cores and unripe parts. Cook always in 
tin or porcelain saucepans. Iron injures color and flavor. 
Stew gently for half an hour ; season to taste with salt, 
pepper, a little sugar, and a tablespoonful of butter. 
Cook gently, uncovered, ten minutes longer, and turn 
into a deep dish. 

Blanc Mange. 
I liberal quart of milk. 

1 oz. Cooper's gelatine, 
f of a cup of white sugar. 

2 teaspoonfuls vanilla. 

Soak the gelatine for two hours in a breakfast-cup of 
cold water. Heat the milk to boiling in a farina-kettle, 
or in a tin pail set in a pot of hot water. Add the soaked 
gelatine and sugar, stir for ten minutes over the fire, and 
strain through a thin muslin bag into a mould wet with, 
cold water. Flavor and set in a cold place to form.- To 
loosen it, dip. the mould for one instant in hot water, de-

tach the surface from the sides by a light pressure of the 
fingers, and reverse over a glass or china dish. Serve 
with powdered sugar and cream. 

By all means have Sunday desserts prepared upon the 
preceding day. To this end, I have endeavored to give 
such receipts for the blessed day as can be easily made 
ready on Saturday. 

Cocoa. 
6 tablespoonfuls of cocoa to each pint of water. 
As much milk as you have water. 
Sugar to taste. 
Rub the cocoa smooth in a little cold water. Have 
ready on the fire the pint of boiling water. Stir in the 
grated cocoa-paste. Boil twenty minutes j add the milk 
and boil five minutes more, stirring often. 
Sweeten in the cups to suit different tastes. 
There is a preparation of cocoa, already powdered, 
called " cocoatina," which needs no boiling. It is very 
good, and . saves the trouble of grating and cooking. I 
regret that, although I have used it frequently and with 
great satisfaction, I have forgotten the name of the manu- 
fecturer. It is put up in round boxes, like mustard, and 
is quite as economical for family use as the cakes of 
cocoa. 

Sponge Cake. 

6 eggs. The weight of the eggs in sugar. 

Half their weight in flour. 

I lemon, juice and rind. 
Beat yolks and whites very light, separately of course, 
the powdered sugar into the yolks when they are smooth 
and thick ; next, the juice and grated peel of the lemon ; 
then the whites with a few swift strokes ; at last, the 
flour, in great, loose handfuls. Stir in lightly, but thor- 
oughly. Too much beating after the flour goes in makes 
sponge cake tough. Bake in round tin moulds, buttered. 
Your oven should be steady. When the cakes begin to 
color on top, cover with paper to prevent burning. 
When cool, wrap in a thick cloth to keep fresh.

Said an irascible householder to a friend from another 
city, whom he chanced to meet in the street one day, 
" Come and dine with me ! But I give you warning we 
shall have nothing for dinner but a confounded dress- 
maker ! " Few of the great middle class, who are the 
strength and glory of our land, would dare take an unex- 
pected guest home on washing-day, although fewer still 
would dare reveal, as frankly as did our blunt citizen, the 
cause of their reluctance to unveil the penetralia of what 
are, upon all days save Black Monday and Blue Tuesday, 
orderly and brightsome households. 

Don't interrupt me, please, my much-tried and much- 
trying sister, upon whose brow the plaits of Monday's 
tribulations have left enduring traces! I know Bridget 
is always cross on wash-day, and that Katy wears an ag- 
grieved air from morning until night ; that dusting, china- 
washing, and divers other unaccustomed tasks are ap- 
pointed unto your already busy self; that John ahd the 
boys hate " pick-up dinners ; " that the modest bills of 
fare set down in this book for the second and third days 
of the week will, at the first glance, seem preposterous 
and unfeeling. You will survey them with very much 
the same feeling as moved Pope to exclaim, with tears in 
his eyes, " From an old fri«nd I had not expected this ! " 
when his host, having allowed him to eat to repletion of 
less savory viands, had brought on, without a note of 
preparation, the poet's favorite dish, a fine hare roasted 
with truffles. But the fact remains that people cannot 
swallow enough on Sunday to support Nature through the 
two days' journey into the wilderness -of making-clean that

follows the season of rest and devotion. It is also true 
that your husband and yourself, with school-children and 
servants, work harder on Monday than upon any other one 
day of the seven, and that your food should be nourishing. 
Should Bridget protest against " hot mate and soup " as 
unprecedented and " onfaling,'' Bridget's mistress (by 
courtesy) must bring another unknown commodity to 
the obstinate Celt, to bear upon the subject — to wit. 
Brains. As I shall try to show, an hour given by your- 
self to the lower regions — too often an inferno on that 
direful day — will put such a repast before unexpectant 
John as shall have for his eye and taste none of the char- 
acteristics of a " pick-up dinner." 

Soup 1 l'Italienne. 

The stock of Sunday's soup strained from the carrots. 

Half a cup of grated cheese and a cup of milk. 

2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet up with water. 

2 eggs beaten light. 

Put the soup on fifteen minutes before dinner, where 
it will heat quickly. The moment it boils, draw it to one 
side, stir in the corn-starch and milk and heat anew, stir- 
ring constantly until it begins to thicken. Set it again 
upon the side of the range, and add the beaten eggs. 
Cover and leave it where it will keep hot, but not cook, 
while you scald the tureen and put the grated cheese in 
the bottom. In five minutes pour the soup upon the 
cheese, stir all up well, and it is ready for the table. 
- This is a delicious soup and easily made. 

Breaded Mutton Chops — Baked. 
Trim the chops neatly and put aside the bones and bits 
of skin for the sauce fof macaroni. Pour a little melted 
butter over the meat. Do this as early in the day as 
convenient, cover them and let them stand until an hour 
before they are to be served. Then, roll each in beaten 
egg, next, in fine cracker-dust, (you can buy it ready 
powdered) and lay them in your dripping-pan with a 
very little water in the bottom — ^just enough to keep them 
from burning. Bake quickly — covering the dripping-pan 
with another — for half an hour. Then remove the upper, 



1 8 JANUARY. 

baste the chops with butter and hot water, and let them' 
brown. When done, lay them upoii a hot dish and set 
in the open oven to keep warm. Add to the gravy 
in. the dripping-pan a little hot water, a teaspoonful of 
browned flour, a tablespoonful of catsup, a small quan- 
tity of minced onion, pepper and salt. Boil up once, 
strain, and pour over the chops. 

Macaroni with Tomato Sauce. 
Break the macaroni into short pieces and set over the 
fire with enough boiling water to cover it well, as it 

^swells to treble its original dimensions. In twenty min- 
utes it should be tender. Drain off the water carefully, 
not to break the macaroni, and stir lightly into it pepper, 

■ salt, and a tablespoonful of butter. Turn it into a deep 
dish and pour over it a sauce made as follows : To the 
bones and refuse bits left from trimming the chops, add a 
pint of cold water, and stew slowly upon the back of the 
range, (lest Bridget should be inconvenienced thereby,) 
until you have less than a cupful of good gravy. Strain 
out the bones, etc., season to taste, and add what was left 
from the stewed tomatoes of yesterday. Having had the 
provision for to-day's dinner in mind, you will have acted 
wisely in seeing for yourself that it did not go into the 
swill-pail under the head of " scraps." Cook tomatoes 
and gravy together for three minutes after they begin to 
simmer, and po'ur, smoking hot, oyer the macaroni. Let 
it stand covered a few minutes before serving. 

Potato Puff. 
To two cilpfuls of cold mashed potato (more of yester- 
day's leavings), add a tablespoonful of melted butter, and 
beat to a cream. Put with this two e.ggs whipped light, 
and a cupful of milk, salting to taste. Beat all well ; pour 
into a greased baking-dish, and bake quickly to a light 
brown. Serve in the dish in which it was cooked. 

Corn-starch Hasty Pudding. 
I quart of fresh milk. 
I tablespoonful of butter. 

4 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet up with water. 
I teaspoonful of salt. . 



FIRST WEEK— TUESDAY. 19 

Heat the milk to scalding, and stir into it the corn- 
starch until it has boiled ten minutes and is thick and 
smooth throughout.- Add salt and butter, let the pud- 
ding stand in the farina-kettle in which it has been boiled — 
the hot water around it — for three minutes before turning 
it into a deep open dish. 

Eat with butter and sugar, or with powdered sugar and 
cream, with nutmeg grated over it. 

Coffee. 
A French coffee-pot is a convenience on Monday. If 
you have one, you know how to use it. If not, put a 
quart of boiling water into your coffee-pot ; wet up a cupful 
of ground coffee with the white of an egg, adding the 
egg-shell, and a little cold water. Put this into the boil- 
ing hot water, and boil fast ten minutes. Then, add half a 
cup of cold water, and set it upon the hearth or table to 
" settle" for five minutes. Pour it off carefully into your 
metal or china coflFee-pot or urn. 



JirBt X&ttk. Siiieabag. 

Scotch Broth. 
Rolled Beefsteaks. Cabbage Salad. 

Browned Potatoes. Baked Beans. 



Apple and Tapioca Pudding. 
Hard Sauce. 



Scotch Broth. 
3 lbs. of veal and bones from neck or knuckle. 
3 quarts of water. 
I onion. 
I turnip. 

3 stalks of celery. 
I cupful pearl barley. 
Salt and pepper to taste. 



20 JANUARY. 

Crack the bones and mince the meat early in the day, 
if you dine near midday, and put on with the cold water. 
Soak the barley in lukewarm water, after washing it well, 
and when it has Iain in the tepid bath for two hours, put 
it in the same over the fire to cook slowly, keeping it 
covered fully by adding hot water from the kettle. Wash, 
scrape and chop the vegetables ; cover with cold water, 
and stew in a saucepan by themselves. When they are 
very soft, rub them through a colander ; add the water 
in which they were cooked, and keep hot until the meat 
in the soup-kettle has boiled to rags. For this purpose 
four hours are better than three. Strain out bones and 
meat ; put soup-stock, barley (with the water in which it 
has boiled), vegetable broth, pepper and salt, into one 
kettle and boil slowly for thirty minutes. A little chopped 
parsley is an improvement. 



Rolled Beefsteaks. 

2 good sirloin steaks. 

Bread-crumbs. 

A slice of fat salt pork. 

Seasoning, a little minced onion, pepper and salt. 

Take out the bones from the steak and throw them 
into the soup-pot. If your butcher has not already done 
so, beat the meat flat with the brOsid side of a hatchet, 
and cover it with a force-meat made of bread-crumbs, 
minced pork, and half an onion. Moisten this slightly 
with water, and season to taste. Roll each steak up, 
closely enclosing the stuffing ; bind with twine into two com- 
pact bundles and lay in a dripping-pan. Dash a cupful of 
boiling water over each, cover with an inverted pan, and 
bake about three-quarters of an hour, in their own steam. 
At the end of this time remove the cover, baste with 
butter and dredge with flour to brown the meat. When 
they are of a fine color, lay upon a hot dish. Thicken 
the gravy with a little browned flour, boil up and send to 
table in a boat. In removing the strings from the rolled 
beef prior to serving, clip them in several places, that the 
form of the meat may not b9»disturbed. 



FIRST WEEK— TUESDAY. 21 

Cabbage Salad. 
I small head of cabbage, chopped fine, or cut into 

shreds. 
. I cup of boiling milk. 
J of a cup of vinegar. 
I tablespoonful of butter. 

1 tablespoonful of white sugar. 

2 eggs well beaten. 

I teaspoonful essence of celery. 

Pepper and salt. 

Heat milk and vinegar in separate vessels. To the 
boiling vinegar add butter, sugar, and seasoning, lastly 
the chopped cabbage. Heat to scalding, but do not let 
it boil. Stir the beaten eggs into the hot milk. Cook 
one minute together after they begin to boil. Turn the 
hot cabbage into a bowl ; pour the custard over it ; toss 
up and about with a wooden or silver fork, until all the 
ingredients are well mixed. Cover and set in a very cold 
place for some hours. 

This is a very delightful salad, quite repaying the 
trouble of cooking the dressing. 

Browned Potatoes. 
Boil large potatoes with their skins on ; peel them, and, 
when you uncover your beef for browning, lay the pota- 
toes in the dripping-pan about the meat. Dredge and 
baste them as well as the beef. If not quite brown when 
the meat is ready, leave them in the gravy for awhile, 
before thickening the latter. Drain in a hot colander, 
and arrange neatly around the steaks in the dish, 

Baked Beans. 
Soak dried beans all night in soft water, exchanging 
this in the morning for lukewarm, and this, two hours 
later, for still warmer. Let them lie an hour in this, 
before putting them on to boil in cold water. When 
they are soft, drain and turn them into a bake-dish. Sea- 
son with pei^per and salt, with a liberal spoonful of butter. 
Add enough boiling water to prevent them from scorching, 
and bake, covered, until they smoke and bubble. Re- 
move the cover, and brown* Serve in the bake-dish. 



22 JANUARY. 

Apple and Tapioca PubDiNG. 

I teacupful tapioca, soaked for five hours in 3 teacup- 
fuls of warm (not hot) water. 

8 juicy pippins, pared and cored. 

3 tablespoonfuls of sugar and a saltspoonful of salt, 
with a few whole cloves. 

Arrange the apples in a deep dish ; add a cup of cold 
water ; cover, and steam in a moderate oven until tender 
all through, turning them once or twice. Turn off half 
the liquid and pour the tapioca, which should have been 
soaked in a warm place, over the apples, when you have 
filled the hollows left by the cores with sugar and put a 
clove in each. The tapioca should be slightly salted. 
Bake one hour, or until, the tapioca is clear and crusted 
on top. Serve in pudding-dish. 

Hard Sauce. 
To two cups of powdered sugar addTialf a cup of butter, 
slightly warmed, so that the two can be worked up 
together. When they are well mixed, beat in half a tea- 
spoonful of nutmeg and the juice of a lemon. Whip 
smooth and light, mound neatly upon a butter-plate, and 
set in the cold to harden. 



Split Pea Soup. 

Halibut Steaks. Boiled Leg of Mutton. 

Caper Sauce. 

Spinach. Stewed Potatoes. 



Cottage Pudding with Liquid Sauce. 



Split Pea Soup. 

1 pint of split peas. 
4 quarts of water. 

2 lbs. of beef and some bones. 
\ lb. of lean bacon or ham. 



FIRST WEEK— WEDNESDAY. 23 

3 stalks of celerj-, the white part only, cut fine. 

Juice of a lemon. 

Stale bread cut into dice and fried. 
Soak the peas all night in soft water, changing it in the 
morning for warm — not hot. Throw this off after an hour 
and cover the peas with four quarts of cold water. Boil in 
this— adding the meat, cut small, the bones well cracked 
and the celery — ^four hours. Always boil soups slowly. 
The neglect of this rule leaves in the kettle a mass of 
toughened meat and an ocean of dish-water. 

When you are ready to take up your soup, strain in a 
colander, picking out and casting aside bits of bones and 
shreds of meat. Rub the peas and celery through the 
holes of the strainer until nothing more will pass. Season 
with pepper and salt ; add the juice of a small lemon, and 
return to the kettle, which must first be rinsed with hot 
water. Let all boil together two minutes. Should it not 
seem so thick as you would like, you can put in, while it 
is boiling, a little corn-starch wet up with cold water. 
Put a couple of slices of stale bread, cut into dice and 
fried crisp in dripping, in the heated tureen, and pour the 
soup upon them. 

Halibut Steaks — Fried. 

Wash and wipe the steaks. Roll each in flour, and fry 
upon a buttered griddle, turning carefully with a spatula, 
or cake-turner, when the lower side is done. They should 
be of a nice brown, and tender throughout. Remove to a 
hot dish and garnish with sliced lemon ; in carving, see 
that a bit of the lemon goes to each person, as many pre- 
fer it to any other sauce for fish. Send around potatoes 
with the steak. Worcestershire is a good store-sauce for 
fish and game. Anchovy is pre-eminently a fish sauce, but 
many do not like it. 

Leg of Mutton— Boiled. 

Do not have the mutton too fat or too large. Cut off 
the shank, which the butcher will have nicked for you, 
leaving about two inches beyond the ham. Wash and 
wipe carefully atid boil in hot water, with a little salt, until 



24 JANUARY. 

a fork will readily pierce the thickest part. About ten or 
twelve minutes to the pound is a good rule in hmHw.g fresh 
meat. Serve with caper sauce. Since you intend to use 
the liquor in which the meat is boiled for to-morrow's soup, 
do not oversalt it. But sprinkle, instead, salt over the leg 
of mutton after it is dished ; rub it all over with butter and 
set in a hot oven for a single minute. 

Caper Sauce. 

1 cup of the liquor in which the meat has been boiled. 

2 teaspoonfuls of flour rubbed smooth in a little water. 

Salt to taste. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

About two dozen capers or green nasturtium-seed. 

Heat the liquor to boiling, and skim before stirring in 
the flour, which must be perfectly free from lumps, and 
rubbed smooth in cold water. Stir until the sauce thickens 
evenly. It is best to cook all sauces in a vessel set within 
a larger one of hot water. When it has boiled about a 
minute, add the butter gradually, stirring each bit in well 
before putting in more. Salt, and drop in the capers. 
Let it just boil, and turn into a sauce-boat. 

Spinach. 

Pull the spinach from the stalks, leaf by leaf; wash care- 
fully, and leave in cold water one hour. Boil in hot water 
fifteen minutes. Drain very dry in a colander ; chop ex- 
tremely fine in a wooden bowl, then return to the saucepan 
with a tablespoonful of butter, a little salt, and a teaspoon- 
ful of white sugar. As it heats beat it up with a wooden 
■ spoon until it is a soft paste. Let it bubble up once, and 
dish. Lay a hard-boiled egg or two, cut in thin slices, 
upon the surface. Few vegetables are more often ruined 
in the cooking than spinach.- The above receipt is simple 
and good. 

Stewed Potatoes. 

Pare and cut mto large dice some good potatoes. Lay 
in cold water half an hour. Stew in cold water, a little 
salted. There should be enough water to cover them 



FIRST WEEK— WEDNESDAY. 2$ 

well. When they are tender and begin to crumble at the 
edges, drain off half the water, and pour in as much milk. 
When they are again scalding hot, stir in a lump of butter 
the size of an egg (for a large dish) rolled in flour, salt, 
pepper and chopped parsley to taste. Boil up once and 
serve in a covered dish. 

Cottage Pudding. 
I cup of powdered sugar. 
I cup of sweet milk. 

1 tablespoonful of butter. 

2 eggs, beaten light, yolks and whites separately. 
Saltspoonful of salt. 

About 3 cups of Keeker's prepared flour, enough for 
cake-batter. 

Rub the butter well into the sugar ; add beaten yolks ; 
the milk, salt, then whipped whites and yolks alternately. 
Bake in a buttered mould. When you can bring out the 
testing-straw clean from the middle of the loaf, turn it 
out upon a dish. Cut in slices while hot, as it is wanted. 

One who has never tried it can hardly believe that the 
result of a receipt which may be tried fearlessly by a 
novice in cookery, could be the really elegant pudding 
just described. 

It is also as economical as toothsome. 

Sauce for Cottage Pudding. 

2 cups of powdered sugar. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

I cup of boiling water, 

I glass sherry wine. 

Nutmeg or cinnamon to taste. 
Rub the butter into the sugar ; add hot water gradu- 
ally ; then spice and wine. Cover tightly to keep in the 
strength of the wine, and set for twenty minutes in* a 
saucepan of boiling water. Stir up and send to table. 



26 JANUARY. 

Vermicelli Soup. 
Scalloped Oysters. Mince of Mutton with Potato Frill. 

Baked Tomatoes. Celery. 



Tipsy Trifle. 
Apples and Nuts. 



Vermicelli Soup. 

Take off all the fat from the broth in which your mutton 
was cooked yesterday, and boil it down slowly ^to two- 
thirds of the original quantity. Stew to pieces, in another 
vessel, a stalk of celery, one small onion, a carrot, and a 
bunch of sweet herbs — all cut up fine. A hani-laone, if 
you have it, or a couple of slices of lean ham, will be an 
improvement to the broth. Strain the soup ; rub the 
vegetables through a fine colander with the water in 
which they were boiled ; return to the fire with a double 
handful of vermicelli broken into short pieces ; boil for 
ten minutes ; add a tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour ; 
boil up and serve. 

Send around a saucer of grated cheese with vermicelli 
and macaroni soups. It is a great improvement to the 
flavor and consistency. Each person may take as much 
or as little as he likes. 

Scalloped Oysters. 
I quart of fine oysters. 

1 coffee-cupful of pounded cracker. 

2 great spoonfuls of butter. 

\ cupful of cream or rich milk. 
Pepper and salt to taste. 
Butter a baking-dish and cover the bottom pretty 
thickly with pounded cracker. Wet with oyster liquor 
and a few spoonfuls of cream. Next, lay oysters, one 
deep, closely over these. Pepper and salt, and stick a 
bit of butter upon each. Another layer of crumbs, wet 



FIRST WEEK— THURSDAY. 2/ 

as before ; more oysters, and proceed in like order until 
your dish is full, making the top layer of crumbs with 
butter dotted over it. Set in the oven, invert a plate or 
tin pan over the dish, and bake until the juice bubbles up 
to the top. Uncover ; set upon the upper grating of the 
oven to brown, and send to table in the bake-dish. Pass 
around sliced lemon with it. 

Oysters, like fish, follow immediately after soup, and 
are a course by themselves. 

Mince of Mutton with Potato Frill. 
The remains of yesterday's mutton, minced, but not 
very fine. 

1 cupful of drawn butter. 

2 tablespoonfuls of cream, or rich milk. 

Pepper, salt, and mace to taste, also chopped parsley. 

1 button onion. 

2 eggs, well beaten. 

Heat the sauce to a boil, add the seasoning and the 
onion, chopped very fine ; then, the meat. Draw the 
saucepan to the side of the range, and let it stand, 
closely covered, in boiling water for ten minutes. Set 
again over the fire and bring to boiling point. Add the 
eggs and milk and set back at the side for five minutes, 
still covered. The mince should never really boil after 
the meat goes in. 

Potato Frill. 
Boil and mash some potatoes ; working in a little milk 
and butter, but not so much as to make the paste very 
soft. Season with salt, and, while still hot, knead in a 
beaten egg. Shape this paste into a fence, on the inside 
round of a shallow dish ; fluting it regularly with the round 
handle of a knife. Set for one minute in a hoi oven, but 
not long enough to cause the fence to crack. Glaze 
quickly with butter, and pour the meat carefully within 
the wall. The mince should not be so thin as to wash 
away the "frill." If well managed this is a pretty and a 
savory dish. 



28 JANUARY. 

Baked Tomatoes, 

I can of tomatoes. 

Stale bread, crumbed fine. 

I tablespoonful of butter. 

Pepper, salt, a little chopped parsley, and white sugar. 

Drain off two-thirds of the liquor from the tomatoes ; 
salt it and set aside for another day's coup. One has nc 
excuse for waste whose "stock-pot" is always near at 
hand. Little comes amiss to it. Cover the bottom of a 
bake-dish with crumbs ; lay the tomatoes evenly upon this 
bed; season with pepper, salt, sugar, and parsley, with 
bits of butter here and there. Strew bread-crumbs over 
all, a thicker layer than at the bottom ; put tiny pieces of 
butter upon this, and bake, covered, about thirty-five min- 
utes. Take off the cover and brown upon the upper shelf 
of the oven. Do not let it stay there long enough to get 
dry. 

Celery — Raw. 
Wash, triili, and scrape the stalks, selecting those that 
are white and tender. Crisp by leaving them in very cold 
water until they are wanted for the table. Arrange neatly 
in a celery-stand. Pass between the oysters and meat. 

Tipsy Trifle. 

I quart of milk. 

3 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately. 

I stale sponge-cake. 

I cup of sugar. 

Flavoring of vanilla. 

I cup of sherry wine. 

A few spoonfuls of currant jelly. 
Make a custard of the milk, sugar, the yolks of the eggs 
and the whites of two. Put in ■ the latter ingredients 
when the milk almost boils, and stir until it begins to 
thicken. Flavor when cold. Put a layer of sliced cake 
in the bottom of a glass bowl. -Wet with the wine and a 
few spoonfuls of custard, and when it is quite soaked, put 
on more cake. Proceed in this manner until the cake 
and wine are used up, when pour on, a little at a time, the 



FIRST WEEK— FRIDAY. 29 

remainder of the custard ; holding down the cake with a 
broad spoon as you do this to keep it from floating. Lay 
a heavy plate upon it, for the same purpose, while you pre- 
pare a meringue by whipping stiif the rest of the whites, 
and then beating in the currant jelly. Cover the trifle 
with this just before dinner-time. 

Apples and Nuts. 
Polish the apples, and crack the nuts, unless you have 
plenty of nut-crackers. Give a knife to each apple-plate, 
and teach the children to pare them neatly for themselves, 
instead of " munching " like rabbits at family dinners, and 
being awkwardly ill at ease when " company " is present. 
Silver or ivory knives are better for fruit than steel.

Soupe Maigre. 

Boiled Cod.. . Roast Duck with Bread Sauce. 

Mashed Potatoes. Rice Croquettes. 

Stewed Celery. 



Apple Pie. 



SouPE Maigre. 
I quart of milk. 
3 pints of water. 
I onion. 
I turnip. 

3 stalks of celery. 

1 potato (large). 

Quarter of a small cabbage, sliced. 
\ cup of bread-crumbs, very dry. 

2 eggs, beaten light. 

Parsley, pepper, and salt to taste. 

4 tablespoonfuls of butter. 



30 JANUARY. 

Clean, scrape, and mince the vegetables, and put on to 
cook in cold water, enough to cover them well. When 
they are scalding hot, drain, and cover them with three 
pints of boiling water. Stew slowly in this until they are 
reduced to pulp. Rub through a colander, season, and 
heat again to boiling. Stir in the bread-crumbs ; then the 
butter, very gradually. Have the milk ready, heated in 
another vessel, and pour into the soup-kettle at this junc- 
ture. Let the soup get very hot, but not boil. Set upon 
the side of the range, and, dipping out a cupful, add it, a 
little at a time, to the beaten eggs. When well mixed, 
return eggs and liquor to the rest of the soup ; stir over the 
fire for an instant, but never to boiling, and serve in a hot 
tureen. 

The eggs' should not be allowed to curdle in the liquor ; 
hence the need of carefulness in following the directions 
above given. A little grated cheese is a pleasant accom- 
paniment to this soup, each person adding it as pleases 
him. 

Boiled Cod. 

Lay the fish in cold water, a little salt, for half an hour. 
Wipe dry, and sew up in a linen cloth' coarse and clean, 
fitted to the shape of the piece of cod. Have but one fold 
over each parti Lay in the fish-kettle, cover with boiling 
water, salted at discretion. Allow nearly an hour for a 
piece weighing four pounds. 



Sauce. 

To one gill of boiling water allow as much milk ; stir 
into this, while boiling, two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
added gradually, a tablespoonful of flour wet up with cold 
water, and, as it thickens, the chopped yolk of a boiled 
egg and one raw egg, beaten light. Take directly from 
the fire, season with pepper, salt, a little chopped parsley 
and the juice of a lemon, and set, covered, in boiling water, 
but not over the fire, for five minutes, stirring occasion- 
ally. Pour part of the sauce over the fish when dished ; 
the rest in a boat. Send aiound mashed potatoes with it. 



FIRST WEEK—FRIDAY. 3 1 

Roast Duck. 
Clean the duck very carefully, rinsing it out with a 
little soda and water, and afterwards with fresh water. Lay 
in cold, salted water for an hour. Wipe dry, inside and 
out, and stuff with a dressing of bread-crumbs, seasoned 
with pepper and salt, a very little powdered sage and a 
" suspicion " of minced onion. Sew up ; dash a cup of 
boiling water over them, as they lie in the dripping-pan, 
and roast, covered, for the first half-hour. Remove the 
cover, and baste freely — three times with butter and 
water, four or five times with the gravy from the pan. 
Stew the giblets in a little salted water, and reserve to 
piece out to-morrow's salmi. Dish the ducks upon a hot 
platter. 

Bread Sauce. 
Skim the fat well from the gravy left in the dripping- 
pan ; have ready a handful of bread-crumbs (stale), wet 
up with hot water. Thicken the gravy with these when 
it has come to a boil ; season with pepper, salt, and a 
pinch of mace. Boil all together once and serve. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

See receipt for Sunday. 

While I would spare you all waste of time and pains 
in looking up receipts in other parts of this volume, I yet* 
deem it hardly worth while to write out in full the same 
directions twice for the same week — or month. 

Rice Croquettes. 

I cup of cold boiled rice. 

1 teaspoonful of sugar, and half as much salt. 

I teaspoonful of melted butter. 

I egg, beaten light. 

Enough milk to make the rice into stiff paste. 

Sweet lard for frying. 
Work rice, butter, egg, etc., into an adhesive paste, beat- 
ing each ingredient thoroughly into the mixture. Flour 
your hands and make the rice into oval balls. Dip each 
in beaten egg, then in flour, or cracker-dust, and fry 



32 • yANUARY. 

in boiling lard, a few at a time, turning each with great 
care. When the croquettes are of a fine yellow-brown, 
take out with a wire spoon and lay within a heated col- 
ander to drain off every drop of fat. Serve hot, with 
sprigs of parsley laid about them, in an uncovered dish. 

Stewed Celery. 

Cut the celery into inch lengths ; cover with cold 
water and stew until tender. Turn off the water and sup- 
ply its place with enough milk to cover the celery. When 
this begins to boil stir in a good lump of butter rolled in 
flour ; pepper and salt to taste, and stew gently five min- 
utes. 

You will like this vegetable thus prepared. Eat, if 
you like, with a little lemon-juice or vinegar. 

Apple Pie. 

I quart of flour, dried and sifted. 

I lb. of lard. 

I lb. of butter. 

Ice-water to make stiff paste. 
Chop the lard into the dry flour. Wet with ice-water 
into stiff paste, touching as little as may be with your 
•hands. Roll out very tlain, always from you. Stick bits 
of butter all over the sheet ; roll up tightly as you would 
a sheet of paper. Beat flat with your rolling-pin, roll 
out again, and again baste with butter. Repeat the 
operations of rolling up, rolling out, and basting until 
your butter is used up. Set the roll of pastry in a cold, 
dry place for at least one hour. All night would not be 
too long. When it is crisp'and firm, roll out and line your 
buttered pie-plates. The bottom crust should be thinner 
than the upper. And, as a rule, you would do well to 
give the roll of pastry intended for the latter a " baste " 
or two more than that meant for the lower. 

Pare, core and slice juicy, tart apples ; put a layer

Sweet Potatoes — in Jackets. 



Rosie's Rice Custard. 



Macaroni Sotjp. 

4 quarts of cold water. 

3 lbs. of coarse, lean beef, cut into thin strips. 
2 or 3 lbs. of bones, broken small. 

4 onions, sliced. 

I bunch of sweet herbs, chopped. 

Tomato juice or catsup. 

\ lb. of macaroni. 

A few salt pork bones. 
Fry the meat until half done, in a very little dripping. 
Take it out and fry the onions and bones in the same 
gravy. Put all into a soup-kettle with the herbs, and 
cover with 4 quarts of water (cold). Bring to a slow 
boil, and, at the end of four hours, strain into a great 
bowl to cool, in order that the fat may rise and be taken 
off. Meanwhile, make ready your macaroni by breaking 
it into short bits, covering well with boiling water, a 
little salted, and stewing" slowly twenty minutes, or until 
tender. Add a lump of butter the size of a walnut ; let 
it stand, covered, for a few minutes, while you season 
the soup, adding the tomato juice or catsup. Boil, skim,

and thicken with a tablespoonful of corn-starch wet up 
with cold water. When it is again on the boil, turn in 
the macaroni, taking care not to break it. Heat to 
scalding, but do not boil ; pour out, and serve. 

Ham and Eggs. 
Cut your slices of ham of a uniform size and shape, 
cutting off the rind. Fry quickly in their own fat. Re- 
move from the pan with a wire spoon so soon as they are 
done, and arrange upon a hot dish, setting this within the 
open oven, or upon a pot of boiling water to keep warm. 
Drop the eggs, as you break theni, into the hot fat left 
in the frying-pan. Do not put so many in as to crowd 
one another. Each egg should preserve its individuality. 
Cook about three minutes, without turning. Take up 
with a spatula, or cake-turner, and lay one upon each slice 
of ham. Do not send the gravy to table. Strain, and use 
for dripping. 

Salmi of Duck. 
From the cold ducks left after yesterday's dinner cut 
all the meat in as neat slices as you can, leaving the 
joints of legs and wings whole. Take off the skin ; break 
the carcass into pieces, and put these, with the stuffing, 
into a saucepan with a fried onion, some sweet herbs, 
pepper, salt, and a pinch of allspice. Cover with cold 
water and stew gently, after it reaches the boil, for one 
hour. Cool, that the fat may rise and be taken off. 
Strain the gravy when you have skimmed it ; return to 
the saucepan, boil and skim again, and stir in two table- 
spoonfuls of browned flour, wet with cold water ; lastly, 
stir in a great spoonful of butter. Stew five minutes long- 
er, and put in the meat. Draw to one side of the range, 
and set, closely covered, in a pot of boUing water for ten 
minutes. The meat must be thoroughly heated and 
steeped in the gravy, "but not boil. Take the meat out 
with a perforated spoon, pile neatly upon a dish and pour 
the gravy over it. Garnish with triangles of stale bread 
fried crisp, and send a piece to each person who is helped 
to salmi.

Fried Parsnips. 
Boil, until tender, in hot water slightly salted ; let them 
get abnost cold, scrape, off the skin, and cut in thick, 
long slices. , Dredge with flour and fry in hot dripping, 
turning as they brown. Drain very dry in a hot colan- 
der ; pepper and salt and serve. 

Stewed Salsify. 
Scrape the roots, dropping each into cold water as you 
do this, that they may not change color. Cut in pieces 
an inch long ; cover with hot water and stew until tender. 
Drain off two-thirds of the water and add enough milk to 
cover the salsify. Stew ten minutes in this ; put in a 
good lump of butter rolled thickly in flour. Pepper and 
salt. Boil up for one minute. 

Sweet Potatoes — in Jackets. 
Parboil in their skins when you have washed them, se- 
lecting such as are of like size. Then put in a moderate 
oven and bake until soft all through. You can ascer- 
tain this by pinching the largest. Wipe off and serve in 
their skins.

Boil the rice, drain, and stir, while hot, into the milk. 
Beat the eggs well ; rub butter and sugar to a cream with 
lemon-peel and a little salt, and stir into the warm milk. 
Mix well and bake in a buttered dish in a brisk oven. 
Eat warm or cold. We like it better warm, with a little 
cream poured over it when served in saucers.

I Soupe au Julienne.

SouPE AU Julienne. 

6 lbs. of lean beef. If possible, get it from the shin 
and have the accompanying bones cracked to bits. 

6 quarts of water — cold. 

Prepare the stock on Saturday. Put meat and bones 
into a pot with a close cover, pour on the water, and set 
it where it will heat very slowly. Boil, also very slowly, 
six hours, at the back of the range. Should the water sink 
fast in the pot, replenish from the boiling tea-kettle. At 
the end of six hours, turn the soup, meat, bones and all, 
into an earthenware vessel ; pepper and salt it and set on 
the cellar floor, covered, until next day. Take off, then, 
the cake of excellent dripping from the top ; strain the 
soup and set over the fire, about an hour before dinner, 
and heat gradually. 

The vegetables should be — 

2 carrots. 

3 turnips. 

Half a head of cabbage. 

I pint Shaker corn, soaked overnight. 

6 stalks of celery. 

I quart of tomatoes. 

I large onion. 

Clean, scrape, and mince all these, except the corn 
and tomatoes. Cut the carrot into dice and stew, by it- 
self, in a little cold water. Boil the corn in enough water 
to cover it, and add more hot water as it swells. Cover 



SECOND WEEK— SUNDAY. 37 

the minced vegetables with cold water, and so soon as it 
boils, turn it off, and replenish with boiling, from the ket- 
tle. This will take away the rank taste, from cabbage and 
onion. When they are soft enough to" pulp, strain well, 
but without pressing, into the soup. It is needless to 
add the vegetables, as the strength is in the liquor. Boil 
up and skim the soup before putting in the boiled corn 
and the canned tomatoes, which should be cut up small, 
and the unripe parts removed. Boil fifteen minutes, add 
the carrot, season to taste, and serve.* 

Roast Turkey. 

Rinse out the turkey well with soda and water ; then 
with gait, lastly with fair water. Stuff with a dressing 
made of bread-crumbs, wet up with butter and water and 
seasoned to your taste. Stuff the craw and tie up the 
neck. Fill the body and sew up the vent. I need hardly 
say that these strings are to be clipped and removed after 
the fowl is roasted. Tie the legs to the lower part of the 
body that they may not "sprawl," as the sinews shrink. 
Put into the dripping-pan, pour a teacupful of boiling 
water over it, and roast, basting often, allowing about ten 
minutes' time for every pound. Be careful not to have 
your oven too hot — especially during the first half-hour or 
so. The turkey would, otherwise, be dry and blackened 
on the outside and raw within. And remember how 
much of the perfection of roasting meats and poultry de- 
pends upon basting faithfully. Boil the giblets tender in 
a little water. When the turkey is done, set it where it 
will keep warm ; skim the gravy left in the pan ; add a 
little boiling water ; thicken slightly with browned flour ; 
boil up once and add the giblets minced fine. Season to 
taste ; give another boil, and send to table in a gravy- 
boat. 

Cranberry Sauce. 

Wash and pick over the cranberries ; put on to cook 
in a tin or porcelain vessel, allowing a teacupful of water 

* As I have mentioned in " Breakfast, Luncheon, and Tea," you 
can spare yourselves the trouble of preparing the vegetables for this 
soup by buying those shred and dried for this purpose, put up iii 
packages and sold by grocers. 



38 JANUARY. 

to each quart. Stew slowly, stirring often until they are 
as thick as marmalade. Take from the fire in little over 
an hour, if they have cooked steadily, sweeten plentifully 
with white sugar, and strain through coarse tarlatan, or 
mosquito-net, into a mould wet with cold water. 

Do this on Saturday. On Sunday, turn out into a glass 
dish. 

Mashed Potatoes — Browned. 

Having mashed them in the usual manner, mound 
them smoothly upon a shallow earthenware dish and set 
them in a quick oven, glazing them with butter as they 
color. They should be of a light brown. Slip the 
■ mound from a coarser to a finer platter by the help of 
your cake-turner. It is still better if you have one of 
the pretty " enamelled " bake-dishes lined with porcelain, 
with silver stands for the table. They are invaluable for 
puddings, scallops, etc. 

Stewed Corn. 

Stew one quart of canned corn in its own liquor, set- 
ting the vessel containing it in an outer, of hot water. 
Should the corn be exceptionally dry, add a little cold 
water. When tender, pour in enough milk to cover the 
corn, bring to a boil, and put in a tablespoonful of butter 
rolled in flour, and salt to taste. Stew gently, stirring 
well, three or four minutes, and turn into a deep dish. 
Keep the vessel containing the corn closely covered while 
it is cooking. The steam facilitates the process a id pre- 
serves the color of the corn. 



Celery 

Is the usual accompaniment of roast turkey. Prepare 
by selecting the blanched stalks, scraping off the rust, cut- 
ting off all but the youngest and tenderest tops, and laying 
these in cold water to crisp until wanted for the table. 
Garnish your turkey with alternate light and dark green 
sprigs of celery. 



SECOND WEEK— MONDAY. 39 

Tropical Snow. 

8 sweet oranges. 

I grated cocoanut. 

I glass of pale sherry. 

I cup of powdered sugar. 

5 red bananas. 
Peel and cut the oranges into small pieces by dividing 
each lobe crosswise into thirds. Extract the seeds and 
put a layer of the fruit in the bottom of a glass dish. 
Pour a little wine upon it, and strew with powdered sugar. 
The cocoanut must have been prepared by removing the 
rind and throwing it into cold water for some time before 
grating it. Over the layer of oranges spread one of cocoa- 
nut ; cut the bananas into very thin, round slices, and lay 
these, one deep, upon the cocoanut. Repeat the order 
just given until your dish is full and the oranges and bana- 
nas used up. The top layer must be of cocoanut, heaped 
high, sprinkled with powdered sugar and garnished about 
the base with slices of banana. Eat soon, as the oranges 
toughen in the wine. 

Supplement this pretty, but not substantial dessert by a 
salver of lad/s-fingers, and macaroons, and a good cup of 
coffee.

it over the fire where it will heat, not too quickly, almost 
to a boil. It will not " put back " the business of the 
day twenty minutes, and be a welcome addition to your 
dinner. 

Turkey Scallop. 

Cut the meat from yesterda/s turkey. Crack the car- 
cass to pieces, and put, with bits of skin, fat, and gristle, 
into a saucepan ; cover with cold water, and set on to stew 
slowly into gravy. Chop the meat very fine ; strew the 
bottom of a ^eased bake-dish with crumbs, and cover 
this with a thick stratum of minced turkey, stuffing, and 
tiny bits of butter. Pepper and salt, and put on more 
crumbs, then meat, and so on. Stale bread is better for 
this scallop than cracker-dust. Having used up all your 
meat and reserved enough crumbs for a thick upper crust, 
cover the dish and put aside in a cool place until your 
gravy is ready. It is economy of time, on Monday, to 
slip in such work as this between the many " must be's " 
of the season. Your scallop will be none the worse for 
waiting some hours before, or after, the gravy is added, 
provided you keep it covered. When the gravy has drawn 
all the substance from bones, etc., strain it and return to 
the saucepan with what was left in yesterday's gravy-boat, 
having first skimmed the latter. Boil up, thicken with 
browned flour wet up with cold water ; bring to another 
boil ; pour over the scallop, saving a little to wet the top. 
Now comes your layer of fine bread-crumbs. Wet these 
with the gravy in a bowl, season to taste, beat to a soft 
paste with a couple of eggs and spread evenly over the 
scallop. Invert a plate over the bake-dish and set in the 
oven. When, at the end of half an hour or so, the gravy 
bubbles up at the sides, remove the cover and brown. 
Serve in the pudding-dish. 



Panned Oysters. 

A four-course dinner is hardly in order in most house- 
holds on Monday. You can, if you like, and have an effi- 
cient table-waiter, bring on oysters, as usual, between soup 
and meat. But there will be no violation of the " unities 



SECOND WEEK— MONDAY. 41 

of the drama " of a family dinner, if you send around youi 
oysters, scallop, and vegetables together. 

I quart of oysters. 
Some thin slices of toast. 
Butter, salt, and pepper. 

Have ready some " patty pans " — the more nearly upright 
the sides the better. Cut stale bread in rounds to fit the 
bottoms of these. Toast, and lay a piece in' each. Wet 
with oyster liquor and put into each pan as many oysters 
as it will conveniently hold. Pepper and salt ; put a bit 
of butter upon each ; arrange all in a large dripping-pan ; 
invert another of the same size over it, and bake eight 
minutes, or until the oysters "rufifle." Send hot to table 
in the pans. 

You can toast the bread at breakfast-time if you choose. 
The oysters can go into the oven when the soup is poured 
out, and be in good season on the table. By this arrange- 
ment they will not interfere with the other " baked meats." 
Panned oysters are always popular, and there is no more 
simple manner of cooking this favorite shell-fish. 



Roast Potatoes. 
Choose large, fair potatoes, wash and wipe, and bake 
until soft to the grasp. Three-quarters of an hour should 
suffice. Take out, before the oysters go in ; wipe off dust 
and ashes, and serve in a heated napkin. This will keep 
them hot a long time, yet prevent them from " sweating." 

Tomato Sauce. 
Open a can of tomatoes at least one hour before it is to 
be used, and empty into an earthenware basin, that no 
close or metallic taste may linger about them. Cook in 
tin or porcelain. Stew half an hour, gently; add salt, 
pepper, a teaspoonful of sugar, and three of butter, a 
handful of dry bread-crumbs — or, if you have any stewed 
corn left from yesterday, use that instead of bread. Cook 
ten minutes longer, and turn out. 



42 , JANUARY. 

Floating Island. 

1 quart of milk. 

4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately. 
4 tablespoonfuls (great ones) ai sugar. 

2 teaspoonfuls extract of bitter almond or vanilla. 

(Colgate's extracts are the best in market, and do 
not spoil within a few days after they are uncorked, 
as the manner of some is.) 
\ cup of currant jelly. 

Heat the milk to scalding, but not boiling. Beat the 
yolks, stir into them the sugar, and pour upon them, 
gradually and mixing well, a cupful of the hot milk. Re- 
turn to the saucepan and boil until it begins to thicken. 
You can do this while breakfast is cooking, before the 
Moloch clothes-boiler goes on. When cool, flavor and 
pour into a glass dish. Heap upon the top a meringue 
of the whites whipped until you can cut it, into which 
you have beaten the jelly, a teaspoonful at a time. 

Tea. 

" A comfortable cup of tea " never comes amiss to a 
fagged housewife, be it served at breakfast, luncheon, or 
dinner. The best way to insure its goodness^that is, 
that it be strong, hot and fresh- — is to have your own tea- 
urn or kettle on the table, with a spirit-lamp burning 
under it. Scald the tea-pot, put in the tea ; cover with 
boiling water ; put a " cosey " or a thick napkin about it, 
and let it stand five minutes before filling with more 
boiling water. Wait a minute longer and pour out. 



SECOND WEEK— TUESDAY. 43 

Mutton Soup with Tapioca. 

Salmon Pudding. Beefsteak. 

Potatoes k la Lyonnaise. Macaroni with Cheese. 



Susie's Bread Pudding. 



Mutton Soup with Tapioca. 

3 lbs. perfectly lean mutton. The scrag makes good 

soup and costs little. 
2 or 3 lbs. of bones, well pounded. 

1 onion. 

2 turnips. 
2 carrots. 

2 stalks of celery. 

A few sprigs of parsley. If you have any tomatoes 
left from yesterday, add them, 

4 tablespoonfuls of pearl or granulated tapioca (not 

heaping spoonfuls). 
4 quarts of water. 

Put on the meat, cut in small pieces, with the bones, 
in two quarts of cold water. Heat very slowly, and 
when it boils pour in two quarts of hot water from the 
kettle. Chop the vegetables ; cover with cold water. So 
soon as they begin to simmer, throw oflf the ifirst water, 
replenishing with hot, and stew until they are boiled to 
pieces. The meat should cook steadily, never fast, fivt: 
hours, keeping the pot-lid on. Strain into a great bowl ; 
let it cool to throw the fat to the surface ; skim and re- 
turn to the fire. Season with pepper and salt, boil up, 
take off the scum ; add the vegetables with their liquor. 
Heat together ten minutes, strain again, and bring to a 
slow boil before the tapioca goes in. This should have 
been soaked one hour in cold water, then cooked in the 
same within another vessel of boiling water until each 
grain is clear. It is necessary to stir up often from the 



44 JANUARY. 

bottom while booking. Stir gradually into the soup until 
the tapioca is dissolved. 

Send around grated cheese with this soup. 

Salmon Pudding. 
I can preserved salmon. 

3 eggs. 

4 tablespoonfuls melted butter. 
^ cup fine bread-crumbs. 
Pepper, salt, and minced parsley. 

Mince the fish, draining off the liquor for the sauce. 
Rub in the butter until thoroughly incorporated. Work 
in the crumbs, the seasoning, at last the beaten eggs. 
Put into a buttered pudding-mould, set in a dripping-pan 
fiiU of hot water. Cover the mould, and steam in the 
oven, keeping the water in the pan at a fast boil, filling up 
as it evaporates, for one hour. Set it in cold water one 
minute when you have taken it from the oven. This will 
make it shrink from the sides and turn out easily upon a 
flat dish. 

Sauce for the above. 

I cupful of milk heated to a boil and thickened with a 
tablespoonful of corn-starch, previously wet up 
with cold water. 

The liquor from the salmon. 

I great spoonful of butter. 

I raw egg, beaten light. 

Juice of half a lemon. 

Mace and cayenne pepper to taste. 

Put the egg into the thickened milk when you have 
stirred in the butter and liquor ; take from the fire, season, 
and let it stand in hot water three minutes, covered. 
I,astly, put in the lemon-juice and turn out immediately. 
Pour it all over and about the pudding. Cut the latter 
into slices when helping it out.' 

Beefsteak. 
First of all, let me recommend the plan of broiling a 
steak under, instead of over the grate. I have found so 



SECOND WEEK— TUESDAY. 45 

many and manifest advantages in the former method that 
I have had a gridiron made to fit beneath ray range. 

Wipe the steak dry, and broil upon a buttered gridiron, 
turning frequently, whenever it begins to drip. When 
done, which should be in twelve minutes, if your fire is 
clear and strong, lay upon a hot dish — a chafing-dish is 
best — season with pepper and salt (not until then), 
and butter very liberally. Put over it a hot dbver, and 
wait five minutes before sending to table, to draw the 
juices to the surface and allow the seasoning to pene- 
trate the steak. 

Potatoes i la Lyonnaise. 
Parboil a dozen potatoes at breakfast-time, and set 
aside, when you have peeled them, as they should get 
perfectly cold. When you are ready to cook them, heat 
some butter, or good dripping, in a frying-pan ; fry in it 
one small onion, chopped fine, until it begins to change 
color — say about one minute. Then put in the potatoes, 
cut into ^lice, not too thick or broad. Stir well and cook 
five minutes, taking care the potatoes do not break to 
pieces. They must not brown. Put in some minced 
parsley just before taking them up. Drain dry by shaking 
in a heated colander. Serve very hot. 

Macaroni with Cheese. 
Cook half a pound of pipe macaroni, broken into inch 
lengths, in boiling water until tender. Drain this off, and 
substitute a cupful of cold milk. When the macaroni has 
again come to a boil, season with pepper and salt and stir 
in a great spoonful of butter ; lastly, two tablespoonfuls 
of dry, grated cheese. Turn into a deep dish, strew more 
cheese thickly over it, and it is ready for use. 

Susie's Bread Pudding. 
I quart of milk. 
4 eggs. 

3 cups very fine, dry bread-crumbs. 
I tablespoonful of melted butter. 
I teacupful white sugar. 
Juice and half the grated peel of a lemon. 



46 JANUARY. 

Rub butter and sugar together. Beat the yolks of the 
four eggs and the white of one very light ; mix the butter 
and sugar with these. Soak the crumbs in the milk, and 
beat in with the other ingredients, hard and fast. Add 
the lemon last. Bake in a buttered dish. When nearly 
done and fully " set," even in the middle, spread with a 
meringue made of the reserved whites, beaten stiff with 
a little sugar. It is good eaten warm^n'ot really hot— 
or cold, especially if a little cream be poured over each 
saucerful.

Bean Soup. 
Fillet of Veal, Stuffed. Baked Corn. 

Potato Cakes. Canned String-Beans. 



Baked Apple Dumplings. 
Brandy Sauce. 



Bean Soup. 

Soak a quart of dried beans all night in ' soft water. 
Throw this off next morning, and cover the beans for two 
hours in water a little more than lukewarm. Put over 
the fire with five quarts of cold water, and one poitnd of 
salt pork. A bone of veal or beef may be added, if you 
have it. Boil slowly for at least four hours ; shred into 
it a small onion, four stalks of celery, pepper^the pork 
may salt it sufficiently — simmer half an hour longer, rub 
through a colander until only husks and fibres remain, and 
send to table. Pass sliced lemon with it. 

Fillet of Veal — Stuffed. 

Make ready a force-meat of bread-crumbs, chopped 
thyme and parsley ; pepper, salt, and a pinch of nutmeg ; 



SECOND WEEK— WEDNESDAY. 47 

a little dripping for shortening ; moisten with warm water 
and bind with a raw egg. 

If your butcher has not "put up'' the fillet, remove 
the bone, pin the meat into a round with skewers ; then 
bind firmly with a strip of muslin passed two or three 
times about it. Fill the cavity left by the bone with 
dressing, and thrust the same between the folds of the 
meat, besides making cuts with a sharp knife to receive 
more. Tuck in a strip of fat pork here and there. Baste 
three times with salt and water while roasting, afterwards 
with its own gravy. At last, dredge once with flour and 
baste with butter. Cut the bands, draw out the skewers 
carefully, and serve. 

Baked Corn. 

To one can of corn allow a pint of milk (more if the corn 
be dry), three eggs, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, 
one of white sugar, pepper and salt to taste. Beat the 
eggs very light, rub butter and sugar together and stir in 
hard ; next, the corn and seasoning ; finally, the milk. 
Beat hard, and bake in a buttered dish for half an hour, 
covered. Then brown by lifting the top. Send up in 
the bake-dish. 

Potato Cakks. 

Boil and mash the potatoes, working in salt and butter 
and an egg or two — beaten light. Let them get cold ; 
make into cakes of size and shape to suit yourself; roll 
in raw egg, then in flour, or cracker-dust, and fry quickly 
in hot dripping. Take each up as soon as it is done, and 
drain with a wire spoon, before laying upon a hot dish. 

Canned String-Beans. 

Cook in their own liquor half an hour, or until very 
tender. First, however, cut them into neat lengths. 
The comeliness of the dish depends upon this. When 
almost done, stir in a tablespoonful of butter, with salt 
and pepper. Simmer ten minutes longer, and .sei-ve by 
draining off the liquid and heaping the beans upon a hot 
dish, with a bit of butter on the top. If the can does not

contain liquor enough to cover the beans, add a little 
cold water in cooking them. 

Baked Apple Dumplings. 

I quart prepared flour. 

I tablespoonful of butter and the same of lard. 

I pint of milk. 

I saltspoonful of salt. 

Some ripe apples. 

Chop the shortening into the flour when you have sifted 
and salted the latter. Wet up with milk and roll out 
quickly in a sheet less than half an inch thick. Cut into 
squares ; lay in the centre of each a tart, juicy apple, 
pared and cored. Bring the corners of the square to- 
gether and pinch to join them neatly. Lay in a baking- 
pan, the joined edges downward, and bake to a fine 
brown. When done, brush over with butter and shut the 
oven-door for a minute more to glaze them. Sift powdered 
sugar over them, and eat. hot. 

These are more wholesome and more easily prepared 
than boiled dumplings. Eat with sweet sauce. 

Brandy Sauce. 

2 cups of powdered sugar. 

■J- cup of butter. 

I wineglass of brandy. That from brandied peaches — 

the liqueur, if you have it. 
I teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and mace. 

Warm the butter slightly, work in the sugar until they 
form a rich cream, when add brandy and spice. Beat 
hard ; shape by putting into a mould made very wet with 
cold water, and set in a cool place to harden. Should it 
not turn out readily by shaking gently, dip for a second 
in hot water. 



SECOND WEEK— THURSDAY. 49 

Veal and Sago Soup. 

Jugged Rabbit. Scalloped Potatoes. 

Sweet Potatoes, Fried. Minced Celery with Egg Dressing. 



Macaroni and Almond Pudding. 

Veal and Sago Soup. 
3 lbs. veal. 
\ lb. pearl sago. 

3 quarts of water. 

4 eggs. 

I pint of milk. 

Cut the meat into bits ; put on with the water and boil 
very slowly, with the pot-lid laid on loosely, four hours, 
until the meat is in rags. Strain .through coarse net, or a 
wire soup-strainer {which you ought to possess), season 
with pepper and salt, and return to the kettle when you 
have scalded it out. 

Meanwhile, the sago should have been washed and 
soaked in lukewarm water, for an hour. Stir it into the 
broth and let them simmer, stirring often, half an hour. 
Heat the milk scalding hot in another vessel, beat the 
yolks of the eggs light, reserving the whites for your 
pudding; pour gradually over these a cupful of the hot 
milk, and stir carefully into the soup with all the milk. 
Taste, to see if it needs more seasoning ; add a little 
chopped parsley, if you like ; let it almost boil and pour 
into the tureen. It should be about as thick as boiled 
custard. Should the sago thicken it too much, add boil- 
ing water. 

A relishful and wholesome soup. 

Jugged Rabbit. 
I full-grown but tender rabbit or hare. 
^ lb. corned ham. 
I cup of good gravy, saved from yesterday's roast.

50 JANUARY. 

Dripping for frying. 

1 onion, sliced. 

Juice of I lemon. 

I tablespoonful currant jelly. 

Parsley, pepper and salt, and browned flour. 
Joint the rabbit, and lay for an hour in salted water. 
Wipe dry and fry in the dripping, with the onion, until 
brown. Put in the bottom of a tin pail, or farina-kettle, 
a layer of salt pork cut into strips ; upon this one of . 
rabbit. Sprinkle with pepper and a little salt. Scatter 
fried onion over the rabbit and proceed in this order un- 
til your meat is used up. Pour in the gravy ; coyer 
the vessel, and set it in another of cold water. Bring 
gradually to a boil and stew steadily one hour, or until 
tender. Arrange the meat upon a dish ; strain the gravy, 
thicken with browned flour wet up with cold water ; boil 
up once ; stir in the jelly and lemon-juice, heat to boiling, 
and pour over the rabbit. If you have no gravy, use a 
little butter and water instead. 

Scalloped Potatoes. 

3 cups mashed potato. 

3 tablespoonfuls of milk. 

3 hard-boiled eggs. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

I handful very dry bread-crumbs. 

Salt. 
Work butter, milk, and salt into the hot mashed potatoes. 
Put a layer in the bottom of a pudding-dish well greased ; 
cover this with thin slices of egg; salt and pepper; an- 
other stratum of potato, and so on, until the dish is full. 
Strew bread-crumbs thickly over the uppermost layer of 
potatoes. Stick bits of butter over this and bake, covered, 
until hot throughout ; then brown quickly. Send up in 
the pudding-dish. 

A simple and nice side-dish. 

Sweet Potatoes — Fried. 
Boil, peel, and when cold, slice the potatoes neatly. 
Fry in good dripping until they are of a light brown." 
Drain from the fat and eat hot. . 



SECOND WEEK— THURSDAY. Si 

Minced Celery with Egg Dressing. 
Scrape and wash the celery and cut into half-inch 
lengths, having first crisped it in cold water'. Rub the 
yolks of two hard-boiled eggs to a paste with a tablespoon- 
ful of oil ; add salt, pepper, a little powdered sugar, 
vinegar to make the mixture liquid, and pour over the 
celery. Serve in a salad-bowl and eat at once, lest the 
celery should toughen in the vinegar. 

Macaroni and Almond Pudding. 
\ lb. macaroni. 
3 pints of milk. 

1 cup of white sugar. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butteri 
5 eggs. 

\ lb. sweet almonds, blanched and chopped. 
Rose-water and bitter almond flavoring. 
A little salt and nutmeg. 

Simmer the macaroni half an hour in a pint of the milk. 
When tender, but not broken, put in butter and salt. 
Take the saucepan from the fire and turn out the con- 
tents to cool while you make a custard of the rest of the 
milk, the eggs and sugar. Add the latter to the scalding 
milk, but do not boil the custard. Chop the almonds 
when you have blanched them, i. e., taken off the skins 
with boiling water. As you chop, put in a few drops of 
rose-water from time to time, to prevent oiling. When 
the macaroni is almost cold, mix it with the custard, 
breaking it as little as may be. Season, and last of all, 
stir in the chopped almonds. Bake in a well-buttered 
pudding-dish. Spread with the meringue made from the 
whites of the eggs reserved from the soup. Eat warm 
with powdered sugar and cinnamon.

Fish Chowder. 
Fricasseed Chicken, White. Potatoes k I'ltalienne. 

Tomatoes Stewed with Onion. Cheese Fondu. 



Sponge Gingerbread. 
Chocolate. 



Fish Chowder. 
3 lbs. of cod, cut into strips an inch thick and four 
inches long, and freed from bone so far as is pos- 
sible without breaking the fish. 

1 pint of oysters, 

2 large onions cut into thin slices. 

About \; lb. Boston crackers, split, and buttered thickly. 

Pepper and salt. 

I cup of milk. 

Parsley. 

Cover the bottom of your soup-kettle with the fish ; 
pepper and salt ; strew with sliced-onion, and this with the 
split crackers, buttered sides down. Follow this order until 
your ingredients are all in the pot, and cover them with 
cold water. Stew gently for an hour, keeping the water 
at the original level by replenishing from the tea-kettle. 
By this time the fish should be thoroughly done, if it has 
cooked steadily. Take it up with a perforated skimmer, 
and cover in the tureen to keep hot, while you strain the 
chowder to get out the bones, returning the crackers with 
the liquor to the soup-kettle, when you have rinsed it out. 
Thicken with two teaspoonfuls of corn-starch wet up 
in a cup of milk, and when this has boiled, add the oys- 
ters, cut small, two great spoonfuls of butter, and a little 
chopped parsley. Stew for three minutes, pour slowly 
over the fish in the tureen. Send sliced lemon around with 
it. 

This is a most palatable chowder when properly pre- 
pared. You can use fewer crackers, if you dislike a thick 
soup. 



SECOND WEEK— FRIDAY. S3 

Fricasseed Chicken — White. 
One pair of full-grown fowls. 
\ lb. salt pork cut into strips. 
2 eggs. 

1 cupful of milk. 

2 tablespoonfuls of flour and the same of butter. 
1 onion. 

Parsley, pepper and salt. 
Joint the fowls neatly, and cut the back, neck, and 
breast apart- from each other, the latter into two pieces. 
Lay them in salt water for half an hour. Put them into 
a pot with enough cold water to cover them, and the 
pork cut into thin strips. Cover and heat very slowly. 
Stew constantly, but never fast, for one hour after it 
comes to a boil, or until the 'chickens are tender. The 
time will depend upon their age. If they are tough, put 
them on early and cook all the more slowly. Add now 
the onion, parsley, and pepper, with salt, if needed. 
Heat again, and stir in the flour wet up in the cup of 
milk. Beat the eggs and pour upon them a cupful of 
hot gravy ; mix well, and put back into the soup with the 
butter. Just as the stew begins to simmer again, remove 
from the fire. Take out and pile the chicken upon a 
dish ; then pour the gravy over all. 

Potatoes 1 l'Italienne. 

Instead of mashing the potatoes with a beetle or spoon, 
whip them up light with a silver fork. When they are 
fine and mealy, beat in a few spoonfuls of milk, a table- 
spoonful of butter, the yolks of two eggs, pepper and salt. 
Whip into a creamy heap before adding, with a few dex- 
terous strokes, the stiffly-frothed whites. Pile roughly up 
on a buttered pie-dish ; brown quickly in the oven, and 
transfer, with the help of a cake-turner, to a flat dish. 

Make a rather too abundant dish, according to this re- 
■ ceipt, as the residue will be found useful in to-morrow's 
bill of fare. 

Tomatoes Stewed with Onion. 
Stew in the usual manner, adding a small onion-minced 
fine. When they have cooked half an hour, season with 



S4 JANUARY. 

pepper, salt, a little sugar, and a good spoonful of butter. 
Simmer ten minutes more, uncovered, and turn out. 

Cheese Fondu. 

1 cup of bread-crumbs, dry and fine. 

2 scant cups oi fresh milk. 

\ lb. dry, rich cheese, grated. 

3 eggs, whipped light. 

I tablespoonful of melted butter. 
Pepper and salt. 

A pinch of soda, dissolved in hot water. 
Soak the crumbs in the milk ; beat in the eggs, the but- 
ter, seasoning — lastly, the cheese. Pour into a neat pud- 
ding-dish, strew dry bread-crumbs over the top, and bake 
in a quick oven until delicately browned. Serve in the 
pudding-dish, and at once, as it falls in cooling. 
Very good ! 

Sponge Gingerbread. 

5 cups of flour, dried and sifted. Measure after sifting. 

1 cup of molasses. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

1 cup of sugar. 

r rather larger cup of sour, or buttermilk. 

2 teaspoonfuls of saleratus (not soda), dissolved in hot 

water. 

2 teaspoonfuls ginger. 

I teaspoonful of cinnamon. 

Mix molasses, sugar, butter, and.spice together. Warm 
slightly, and beat hard for five minutes. Add the milk, 
then the soda, lastly the flpur. Beaf three minutes, and 
bake in a broad, shallow pan. Take heed that it does not 
burn. Eat warm. 

Chocolate. 

6 tab'espoonfuls of chocolate to each pint of boiling 

water. 
As much milk as you have chocolate. 
Sweeten to taste. 

Rub -the chocolate smooth in a little cold water, and 
stir into the hot. Boil twenty minutes ; put in the milk, 



SECOND WEEK— SATURDAY. SS 

and boil five minutes more, stirring often. Sweeten at 
pleasure, while boiling, or in the cups. Send around with 
the warm gingerbread and some slices of mild cheese. 
You will not regret not having prepared a more pretentious 
dessert.

Clear Gravy Soup. 
Oyster Salad. Calf s Liver i la Mode. 

Salsify Fritters. Potatoes a la Duchesse. 



Corn-meal Fruit Pudding. 



Clear Gravy Soup. 

5 lbs. lean beef, the coarser parts, of course. 
Some bones. 

2 slices of lean corned ham. 
2 carrots. 
2 turnips. 

6 stalks of celery. 

\ package Coxe's gelatine. 

Pepper and salt. 

A bunch of sweet herbs. 

Dripping. 

5 quarts of cold water. 

Cut the meat into dice and slice the onions. Fry the 
latter brown in some good dripping. Take them out, and 
fry the meat in the same fat, turning often, until it has a 
thick brown coat. Put it, drained from the fat, into the 
soup-kettle, with two quarts of cold water, and set where 
it will come to a boil in about an hour. The bones should 
also be fried, and put into the pot with the meat. When 
these fairly boil, skim, add three quarts of cold water, and 
stew gently four hours. If you dine early, the soup should 
go on before- breakfast. Put herbs and vegetables, in- 
cluding the fried onions, all chopped up, into a saucepan, 



56 JANUARY. 

with enough cold water to cover them, and boil to pieces. 
Strain the soup half an hour before dinner ; season, re- 
turn to the pot; boil and skim. Strain the vegetable 
liquor into it, without squeezing or rubbing. Boil Up 
once more, skim well, and put in the gelatine, which 
should have soaked one hour in a little cold water. Sim- 
mer five minutes and pour out. 

The soup should be of a clear, light brown. Should the 
color not suit you, burn a tablespoonful of sugar in a tin 
cup, add three or four spoonfuls of boiling water, stir until 
you get a deep color, and turn off the water into the soup. 
It will not injure the flavor. 

Please never lose sight of the cardinal principle that all 
the essence, strength, and taste should be extracted from 
meat, vegetables, etc., in soup-making, and that the soup 
which boils fast is lost. Take plenty of time, and cast an 
eye into the kitchen from hour to hour until you have edu- 
cated your cook up to a glimmering appreciation of this 
law of enlightened cookery. 

. Oyster Salad. 

I quart of oysters, cut, not chopped, into small pieces. 

I bunch of celery, also^K/ small. 

I tablespoonful best oil. 

I small spoonful of salt, and the same of pepper, like- 
wise of mustard (made). 

■J cup cider vinegar. 

Saltspoonful of powdered sugar. 

Drain the Uquor from the oysters and cut them up. 
Add the minced celery. Prepare the seasoning, putting in 
the vinegar last, and pour the mixture over the celery and 
oysters. Toss up well with a silver fork. Do this, just 
before dinner, as the salad will be injured by lying long in 
the dressing. 

Calf's Liver k la Mode. 

1 calf s liver. 

\ lb. fat salt pork. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter, or dripping. 
2 small onions. 

I tablespoonful chopped parsley and marjoram. 



SECOND WEEK—SATURDAY. $7 

2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 

I teaspoonful mixed cloves, mace, and allspice. 

I tabiespoonful Worcestershire sauce. 

Pepper and salt to taste. 
Wash the liver thoroughly, and soak half an hour in 
salted water. Wipe, make incisions about an inch apart, 
and lard with strips of pork, projecting slightly on each 
side. Fry the onions and herbs in the dripping. Take 
them out, put in the liver, and fry both sides to a light 
brown. Turn all. into a saucepan, with the vinegar and 
water to cover the liver — barely. Cover closely, and stew 
gently an hour and a half. Lay the liver on ahot dish, strain 
the gravy, return to the fire, thicken with a lablespoonful 
of browned flour, put in the sauce and spice; boil up and 
pour some of it over the liver, the rest into a gravy-boat. 
What is left from dinner will be nice for luncheon or tea, 
cut horizontally in thin slices. 

Salsify Fritters. 

1 bunch salsify. 

2 eggs. 

^ cup milk. 

Flour for thin batter. 

Lard, or dripping. 

Salt to taste. 
Scrape and grate the roots, and stir into a batter made 
of the beaten eggs, the milk, and flour. Grate the salsify 
directly into this, that it may not blacken by exposure to 
the air. Salt, and drop a spoonful into the boiling fat .to 
see if it is of the right consistency. As fast as you fry the 
fritters, throw into a hot colander to drain. One great 
spoonful of batter should make a fritter. 

Potatoes 1 la Duchesse. 

Cut the remnants of yesterday's potatoes d t Italienne 
into rounds with a cake-cutter, dipped in cold water. Set 
like biscuits, but not so near as to touch one another, in 
a greased pan, and bake quickly, brushing top and sides 
with beaten egg when they begin to brown. Serve upon 
a heated napkin folded flat, on a platter.

namon. ' 

E teaspoonful of soda, and two teaspoonfuls of cream 
of tartar, sifted twice with the flour. 

Scald a pint of milk and wet up the meal with it, stirring 
well. While it is cooling, add the flour, wet into batter 
with a pint of cold milk. Heat the remaining pint, and 
when scalding, add sugar and eggs. Beat this gradually, 
hard and long, into the cooled paste. When well mixed, 
put in butter, spice, and the fruit dredged with flouj-. 
Beat fast and deep for two minutes. Bake in a buttered 
dish, in a tolerably brisk oven. Cover with paper as it 
browns. It ought to be done in three-quarters of an hour. 
Eat hot, with butter and sugar.

Macaroni al Napolitano. 

Potatoes au nature!. French Beans, Sautg. 

Apple Sauce. Made Mustard. 



Narcissus Blanc-niange. 
Coffee. 



Tomato Soup. 
Stew one can of tomatoes half an hour ; strain and rub 
through a colander into the soup left from yesteiday. 



THIRD WEEK— SUNDAY. 59 

Heat to a slow boil, and simmer together ten minutes 
before serving. 

Roast Beef, with Yorkshire Pudding. 
Have your meat ready for roasting on Saturday, always. 
Roast upon a grating or several clean sticks (not pine) laid 
over the dripping-pan. Dash a cup of boiling water over the 
beef when it goes into the oven ; baste often, and see that 
the fat does not scorch. About three-quarters of an hour 
before it is done, mix the pudding. 

Yorkshire Pudding. 

1 pint of milk. 

4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately. 

2 cups of flour — prepared flour is best. 
I teaspoonful of salt. 

Use less flour if the batter grows too stiff. Mix 
quickly ; pour off the fat from the top of the gravy in the 
dripping-pan, leaving just enough to prevent the pudding 
from sticking to the bottom. Pour in the batter and con- 
tinue to roast the beef, letting the dripping fall upon the 
pudding below. The oven should be brisk by this time. 
Baste the meat with the gravy you have taken out to make 
room for the batter. 

In serving, cut the pudding into squares and lay about 
the meat in the dish. It is very delicious. 

Macaroni al Napolitano. 
\ lb. of macaroni. 
2 nice sweetbreads. 

1 small onion, minced. 
Parsley, pepper, and salt. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

Wash the sweetbreads ; lay in salted water fifteen min- 
utes, and stew with the onion, in a pint of cold water, a 
little salt, until done, as may be seen by cutting into the 
thickest part. Wash the macaroni when you have broken 
it into small bits, and cook gently until tender, but not to 
breaking, in the hot broth from which you have taken the 
sweetbreads and strained the onion. Stew in a farina- 



6o JANUARY. 

kettle or tin saucepan set in hot water. Chop the sweet- 
breads ; stir the butter into the macaroni, which should 
have absorbed all the broth ; then the minced sweet- 
breads. Season with parsley, pepper, and salt ; cover 
closely and leave in the hot water, but not over the fire, 
five minutes before turning into a deep dish. 

Potatoes au Naturel 
Are, with all their high-sounding name, only the homely 
vegetables boiled in their skins. "Put on in cold water, 
bring to a slow boil, and increase the heat until a fork will 
pierce the largest. Throw in salt ; turn off every drop of 
the water ; set back on the range, without the cover, for 
two minutes to dry, peel, and send to table in a napkin. 

French Beans, Saut6. 

Open a can of French or "string" beans; cut into 
inch lengths and boil in the can liquor, adding a little cold 
water, if needed, for twenty minutes. Drain, return to 
the saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of butter and a little 
salt and pepper. Toss constantly with a fork until they 
are hissing hot, but not until they scorch. Serve in a hot 
vegetable dish, 

» 

Apple Sauce. 

Pare, core, and slice tart apples, and stew in water 
enough to cover them until they break to pieces. Beat 
to a pulp with a good lump of butter and plenty of sugar. 
Eat cold. Make enough for several meals, as it will keep 
a week at this season. 

Made Mustard. 
4 tablespoonfuls English mustard. 
2 teaspoonfuls of salt. 

The same quantity of salad oil and white sugar. 
I teaspoonful of pepper. 
Vinegar to make a smooth paste— that from celery, or 

onion pickle, if you have it. 
Rub mustard, oil, sugar, pepper, and salt together ; wet, 



THIRD WEEK— SUNDAY. 6l 

by degrees, with vinegar, beating very hard at the last, 
when the proper consistency has been gained. 

This is far superior to mustard as usually mixed for the 
table. 

Narcissus Blanc-mange, 

1 quart of milk. 

1 package of Cooper's gelatine, soaked in two cups of 

cold water. 
Yolks of 4 eggs, beaten light. 

2 tups of white sugar. 

Vanilla and rose-water for flavoring. 
Less than 2 cups of rich cream. 

Heat the milk to scalding ; stir in gelatine and sugar. 
When these are dissolved, take out a cupful and pour, by 
degrees, over the beaten yolks. Return to the saucepan 
and stir together over the fire for two minutes after the 
boiling point is reached. Take from the range, flavor 
with rose-water, and pour into a mould with a cylinder in 
the centre, previously wet with cold water. Next day, 
turn out upon a dish with a broad bottom, and fill the 
hollow in the middle with the cream, whipped light with a 
little powdered sugar and flavored with vanilla. Pile 
more whipped cream about the base. 

Send your coffee ai-ound after the blanc-mange has been 
eaten. A spoonful of whipped cream, without the vanilla, 
will give a touch of elegance to the beverage. Let this 
happy thought come to you while you are preparing the 
cream, and before the flavoring goes in. 



62 JANUARY. 

Variety Soup. 
Beef Pudding. Scored Potatoes. 

Canned Peas. Mixed Pickles. 



Apple Meringue. 
Crackers and Cheese. 



Variety Souij. 
"Chop a quarter of a small cabbage, a turnip, and some 
sweet herbs ; Cover with cold water, and heat to boiling. 
Throw off the first water, and add a quart more of cold. 
Put in the roast-beef bones, after you have cut off the 
meat, with a slice or two, or bone, of ham. Stew all two 
hours at the back of the range. Half an hour before dinner, 
warm up what was left from Sunda/s soup. Strain the 
hot liquor in which your cabbage, etc., have boiled, into 
this. Pick out bits of bones and meat from the colander, 
mashing the vegetables as little as possible ; put these 
into the soup, with any macaroni or beans you may have 
left over ; season to your hking ; simmer for ten minutes ; 
thicken with a tablespoonful of corn-starch, and pour out. 
This will not be a " show-soup," but it will be savory 
and nutritious. 

Beef Pudding. 

I pint of milk. 

3 eggs. 

A cupful of prepared flour. 

A little salt. 

I tablespoonful of melted butter. 
Cut the meat from yesterday's roast into neat pieces ; 
lay them in the bottom of a buttered pudding-dish, season 
well, and pour a few spoonfuls of cold gravy over them, 
letting it soak into the meat while you prepare a batter 
according to the above directions, taking care not to get 
it too stiff. Pour over the meat and bake in a quick oven. 
Eat hot. 



THIRD WEEK— TUESDAY. 63 

Scored Potatoes. 
Mash in the usual way, mixing rather soft ; heap and 
round upon a greased pie-plate ; score deeply in triangles 
with the back of a carving or butcher's knife ; brown in 
the oven, and slip carefully to another dish. 

Canned Peas. 
Open a can of peas an hour before cooking them, that 
there may be no miisty, airless taste about them, and turn 
into a bowl. When ready for them put on in a farina- 
kettle — or one saucepan within another — of hot water. 
If dry, add cold water to cover them, and stew about 
twenty -five minutes. Drain, stir in a generous lump of 
butter ; pepper and salt. 

Apple Meringue. 

Butter a neat pudding-dish, and nearly fill it with apple- 
sauce. Cover and leave in the oven until it is smoking 
hot. Draw to the oven door and spread with a meringue 
made of the whites of three eggs, whipped stiif with a little 
pow^dered sugar. (Your pudding will be much nicer, by 
the way, if* you have beaten the yolks into the stewed 
apple before putting it into the dish.) Shut the oven 
door long enough to brown the meringue very lightly. 
Eat nearly or quite cold, with sugar and cream. 

Send around crackers and cheese as an accompaniment. 



Celery Soup. 
Veal Cutlets with Ham. Cauliflower with Cream Sauce. 

Stewed Potatoes. Mixed Pickles. 



Jam Pudding.

3 quarts of cold water. 

1 pint of fresh milk. 

2 dessertspoonfuls of coin-starch. 
Pepper and salt. 

2 tablespoonfiils of butter. 
Some fried bread. 
Cut the veal up small, crack the bones, and put on in 

. cold water. Boil slowly four hours; replenishing with 
boiling water should the broth sink to less than two- 
thirds of the original quantity. Strain, pressing all the 
strength out of the meat. Cut the celery into bits, and 
stew in the broth, with the minced onions, until so soft 

■ that you can rub through a colander. Strain a second 
time, and return the soup, with the pulped celery, to the 
fire. Season, and thicken with the corn-starch wet up in 
the pint of milk. Stir until it boils, and lastly, put in, 
carefully, the butter, after which take from the range. 
Have ready a double handful of fried bread in the tureen, 
and pour the soup upon it. 

VeaL Cutlets and Ham. , 
2 lbs. of veal cutlets, neatly trimmed, and the same of 

sliced ham. 
Yolks of 2 eggs. 
Bread- or cracker-crumbs. 
Dripping for frying. 

Divide each cutlet into pieces about two inches wide by 
three inches long, and cut the ham into slices of corre- 
sponding size. Dip in the egg, then roll in the bread- 
crumbs, and fry — the ham^ first, afterwards the veal, until 
nicely browned on both sides. Sprinkle sa,lt upon the 
veal cutlets. Arrange upon the dish in alternate slices 
of veal and ham, overlapping one another. Anoint the 
ham with butter mixed with a little mustard ; the veal 
with butter melted up with a spoonful of tart jelly. 

Cauliflower with Cream Sauce. 
Boil your cauliflower, when you have washed and 
trimmed it, and tied it up in coarse net or tarletan. 



THIRD WEEK— TUESDAY. 65 

Cook in boiling water slightly salted, keeping the stalk 
end uppermost. Prepare, iq another saucepan, the dress- 
ing, by adding to a cup of scalding milk a tablespoonful 
of corn-starch wet up with cold water, two tablespoonfuls 
of butter, pepper and salt at discretion. Drain the cauli- 
flower, remove the net, put into a deep dish, the flower 
up, and drench with the bcjiling sauce. 

Stewed Potatoes. 

Cut into slices, cook until tender, but not to breaking, 
in hot water. Turn half of this off and replace by as 
much milk, in which .some slices of onion have been 
boiled and strained out. Add pepper and salt, a good 
lump of butter rolled in flour, and some chopped parsley. 
Simmer three minutes, and turn into a vegetable dish. 

Mixed Pickles, 
Home-made or bought, should be passed with the cutlets. 

Jam Pudding. 

3 cups of milk. 

4 eggs. 

|- of a cup of sugar. 

Bread and butter. 

Sweet jam — berry, peach, or quince. 
Spread slices of stale bread with butter, then with jam. 
Fit them closely into a buttered pudding-dish until it is 
two-thirds full. Make a custard by adding the beaten 
eggs and sugar to the scalding milk, but do not let them 
boil. Lay a heavy saucer upon the bread and butter to 
prevent floating, and moisten gradually with the hot cus- 
tard. Let all soak for fifteen minutes before the dish 
goes into the oven. When it is hot throughout, talce off 
the saucer, that the pudding may brown equally. Eat 
cold. 

Tea, and Albert Biscuits 
May follow the pudding.

Sheep's-head Soup. 
Roast Hare, with Currant Jelly. Macaroni, with Ham. 
Stuffed Potatoes. Turnips. 



Fig Pudding. 



Sheep's-head Soup. 

Get your butcher to clean a sheep's head with the skin 
on, as he would a calPs head for soup. Let him also 
split it in half that you may get at the brains. Take 
them out, with the tongue, and set aside. Break the bone 
of the head, wash it well in several waters, and soak for half 
an hour in salted water. Cover it with fresh water, and 
heat gradually to a boil. Drain off the water, and thus 
remove any peculiar odor from the wool or other causes, • 
and add four quarts of cold water, with two turnips, two 
roots of salsify, two carrots, two stalks of celery, and a 
bunch of sweet herbs, all chopped fine. Boil slowly four 
hours. Strain the soup into a bowl, pressing all the 
nourishment out of the meat, and let it stand in a cool 
place until the fat rises thickly to the surface to be taken 
off. The vegetables should be soft enough to pass freely 
through a fine colander, or coarse strainer, when rubbed. 
While the soup cools, prepare the force-meat balls. The* 
tongue and brains should have been cooked and chopped 
up, then rubbed to a paste together and mixed with an 
equal quantity of bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, and parsley, 
bound with a raw egg, and rolled into small balls, dipped 
in flour. Set them, not so near as to touch one another, 
in a tin plate or dripping-pan, and put in a quick oven 
until a crust is formed upon the top, when they must be 
allowed to cool. Return the skimmed broth to the fire ; 
season ; boil up once ; take off the scum, and add a 
cup of milk in which you have stirred a tablespoonful 
of corn-starch. Simmer, stirring all the while, for two 
minutes after it boils. Put the force-meat balls into the 



THIRD WEEK— WEDNESDAY. 6y 

tureen and pour the soup gently over them so as not to 
break them. 

This is a good and cheap soup, and deserves to be 
better known. 

Roast Hare. 

Have the hare skinned and well cleaned. Cooks are 
often careless about the latter duty. Stuff, as you would 
a fowl, with a force-meat of bread-crumbs, chopped fat 
pork, a little sweet marjoram, onion, pepper, and salt, 
just.moistened with hot water. Sew up the hare with fine 
cotton ; tie the legs close to the body in a kneeling posi- 
tion. The English cook it with the head on, but we take it 
off as more seemly in our eyes. Lay in the dripping-pan, 
back uppermost ; pour two cups of boiling water over it ; 
cover with another pan and bake, closely covered, except 
when you baste it with butter and water, for three-quar- 
ters of an hour. Uncover, baste freely with the gravy 
until nicely browned ; dredge with flour and anoint with 
butter until a fine froth appears on the surface. Take up 
the hare, put on a hot dish, and keep covered while you 
make the gravy. Strain, and skim that left in the pan ; 
season, thicken with browned flour, stir in a good spoon- 
ful of currant-jelly, and some chopped parsley; boil up; 
pour a few spoonfuls of it over the hare ; serve the rest 
in a gravy-boat. Clip, instead of tearing hard at the cot- 
ton threads. Send currant-jelly around with it. 

Macaroni and Ham. 

Break the macaroni into inch lengths, and stew ten 
minutes in boiling water. Meanwhile, cut two slices of 
corned (not smoked) ham into dice, wash well and put on 
to boil in a cup of cold water. Drain the macaroni, and 
when the ham has cooked for ten minutes after coming to 
a boil, pour it, with the liquor, over the macaroni. Sea- 
son with pepper, simmer in a closed farina-kettle for fif- 
teen minutes ; add a little chopped parsley, cover, and 
let it stand a minute more, and serve in a deep dish. The 
fatter the ham the better for this dish. Always pass grated 
cheese with stewed macaroni. 



68 JANUARY. 

Stuffed Potatoes. 
Wash and wipe large, fair potatoes, and bake soft. 
Cut a round piece from the top of each, and carefully pre- 
serve it. Scrape out the inside with a spoon without 
breaking the skin, and set aside the empty cases with the 
covers. Mash the potato which you have taken out, 
smoothly, working into it butter, a raw egg, a little cream, 
pepper, and salt. When soft, heat in a saucepan set over 
th? fire in boiling water. Stir until smoking hot, fill the 
skins with the mixture, put on the caps, set in the oven 
for three minutes, and send to table wrapped in a heated 
napkin. 

Turnips. 

Boil, sliced or quartered, until soft all through j drain 
well and mash in a colander with a wooden spoon or 
beetle, very quickly, lest they should cool. Cold turnips 
are detestable. Work in a Htt^e salt and a good lump of 
butter ; serve in a hot dish, smoothly rounded on top, . 
with a pat of pepper here and there. 



Fig Pudding. 

\ lb. good dried figs, washed, wiped, and minced, 

2 cups fine, dry bread-crumbs. 

3 eggs. 

\ cup beef suet, powdered. 
2 scant cups of milk. 
\ cup of white sugar. 
A little salt. 

A pinch of soda, dissolved in hot water and stirred into 
the milk. 

Soak the crumbs in the milk. Add the eggs, beaten 
light, with the sugar, salt, suet, and figs. Beat three min- 
utes, put in a buttered mould with a tight top ; set in 
boiling water with a weight on the cover, to prevent the 
mould from upsetting, and boil three hours. 

Eat hot, with hard sauce, or butter and powdered sugar, 
mixed with nutmeg. It is very good. 



THIRD WEEK— THURSDAY. 69 



Veal and Rice Broth. , 

Stewed Mutton a la Jardiniere. Potato Puff. 

Pork and Beans. Grape Jelly. 



Minced Pudding. 
Apples, Nuts, and Raisins. 



Veal and Rice Broth. 

4 lbs. knuckle of veal, well broken up. 

1 onion. 

2 stalks of celery. 

■J- cup of rice, washed and picked over. 

Chopped parsley, pepper, and salt. 

I cup of milk. 

4 qts. of cold water. 

I tablespoonful corn-starch. 
Put on the veal and bones, with the onion and celery 
minced, in four quarts of cold water. Boil gently after 
it begins to bubble, four hours, keeping the pot-lid on. 
Soak the rice in lukewarm water, enough to cover it well 
— adding warmer as it swells — for one hour. Cook in 
the same water, never touching with a spoon, but shaking 
up from the bottom, now and then. Strain and press 
the soup into a bowl ; cool to throw up the fat for the 
skimmer, and return to the pot. Salt and pepper ; boil 
up and skim, and stir in the corn-starch wet up in the 
milk. Simmer three minutes ; put in the rice witli the 
water in which it was boiled, and the parsley. Simmer 
very gently five minutes, and pour out. 

Mutton 1 la Jardiniere. 

5 lbs. of mutton, breast or neck, all in one piece. 
2 onions, J 

1 carrot, [■'peeled. 

2 turnips, ) 



70 JANUARY. 

1 pint canned tomatoes. 
A few sprigs of cauliflower. 

2 stalks of blanched celery. 
Pepper and salt. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

I tablespoonful of corn-starch. 

Dripping for frying. 
Fry the mutton (whole) in a large frying-pan, until it is 
lightly browned on both, sides. Put into a deep, broad 
saucepan with all the vegetables (also whole) except the 
tomatoes ; cover with cold water, and stew, closely cov- 
ered, for an hour afterthey begin to boil. Take out the 
vegetables, and set aside ; add boiling water to the meat, 
if it is not covered, and simmer steadily, never fast, two 
hours longer. The meat should be tender throughout, 
even the fibres. Turn off all the gravy, except about 
half a cupful, fit the pot-lid on very tightly, and leave the 
meat where it will keep just below the cooking-point. 
Strain the gravy you have poured off; leave it to cool 
until the fat rises. Skim, and return to the pot with the 
tomatoes. Season, and boil fast, skimming two or three 
times, until it is reduced to one-half the original quantity, 
or just enough to half cover the meat. Thicken with 
corn-starch, and put in the meat, with its juices from the 
bottom of the pot. Simmer, closely covered, half an 
hour. Cut the now cooled vegetables into neat dice ; 
put the butter into a saucepan, and when it is hot, the 
vegetables. Shake all together until smoking hot, season, 
add a little gravy from the meat, and leave them to keep 
hot in it while you dish the mutton. Put it in the middle 
of a flat dish, and put the vegetables around it in separate 
mounds, with sprigs of parsley or celery between. Pour 
gravy over the mutton. , 

Try this dish. It is not difficult of preparation, diffuse 
as I have made the directions. It is, if well managed 
and discreetly seasoned, a family dinner of itself, and a 
very cheap one. 

Potato Puff. 
Mash the potatoes as usual ; beat in more milk than is 
your custom, and a couple of eggs, whipping all to a cream, 



THIRD WEEK— THURSDAY. Jl 

and seasoning well. Pour into a buttered pudding-dish, 
and bake quickly to a good brown. 

Pork AND Beans. 
Soak a quart of dried beans overnight in soft water. 
Change this for more and warmer in the morning, and, 
two hours later, put them on to boil in cold. When they 
are soft, drain well, put into a deep dish ; and sink in the 
middle a pound of salt pork (the "middling" is best), 
leaving only the top visible. The pork should have been 
previously parboiled. Bake to a fine brown. It is well to 
score the pork in long furrows to mark the slices, before 



Minced Pudding. 
4 large juicy pippins, pared, cored, and chopped, 
i lb. of raisins, seeded and chopped. 
2 tablespoonfuls beef suet, freed from strings and rubbed 

to powder. 
12 almonds, blanched and minced. 
^ cup of sugar for pudding, and three tablespoonfuls for 

custard. 

1 pint of milk. 
Stale bread. 
Butter to spread it. 

2 eggs. 
Nutmeg. 

Cut the crust from the bread and slice evenly. Butter 
a shallow pudding-dish, and line it with the slices, fitted 
neatly together, and well buttered. Spread thickly with a 
mixture of the ingredients just enumerated, to wit ; apples, 
raisins, suet, and almonds, sweetened, with sugar, and 
spiced with nutmeg. They should form a paste and ad- 
here to the bread. Make a custard by scalding and 
sweetening the milk, then pouring gradually over the 
eggs. Soak the bread, etc., with this by pouring it on, a 
few spoonfuls at a time, until the dish is full. Bake in a 
moderate oven, for a time covered, lest it should dry out. 
Eat cold, with powdered sugar sifted over the top. 

Apples, Nuts, and Raisins 
Should be served on clean plates after the pudding. 



72 JANUARY. 

Puree of Peas. 
Fried Bass. Roast Chicken. 

Mashed Potatoes. Stewed Celery. 

Fried Salsify. Crab-apple Jelly. 



Margherita Lemon Custard. 



PuRfiE OF Peas. 

1 pint of split peas, soaked overnight in soft water. 
3 onions — small. 

3 stalks of celery. 

2 carrots — small. 

I bunch of sweet herbs. 
I pint of tomatoes. 
Season to taste. 

3 tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in flour. 
3 quarts of water. 

Put all on to cook together, except the tonnatoes and 
butter. The vegetables must be chopped fine. Stew 
steadily and gently three hours. Rub to a puree through 
a sieve, and put in the tomatoes, freed of bits of skin and 
cores, and cut into bits. Season, and return to the fire to 
stew for twenty minutes longer, closely covered. Stir in 
the butter — divided into teaspoonfuls, each rolled in flour. 
Boil up and serve. Dice of fried bread should be put into 
the tureen. 

Fried Bass. 

Clean, wipe dry, inside and out, dredge with flour, and 
season with salt. Fry in hot butter, beef-dripping, or sweet 
lard. Half butter half lard is a good mixture for frying 
fish. The moment the fish are done to a good brown, 
take them from the fat and drain' in a hot colander. Gar- 
nish with parsley. 



THIRD WEEK— FRIDAY. 73 

Mashed Potatoes 
Must accompany the fish. 

Roast Chicken. 

Wash well in three waters, adding a little soda to the 
second. Stuff with a mixture of bread-crumbs, butter, 
pepper, and salt. Fill the crops and bodies of the fowls ; 
sew them up with strong, not coarse thread, and tie up the 
necks. Pour a cupful of boiling water over the pair, and 
roast an hour — or more, if they are large. Baste three 
times with butter and water, four or five times with their 
own gravy. 

Stew the giblets, necks, and feet in water, enough to 
cover them well. When you take up the fowls, add this 
liquor to the gravy left in the dripping-pan, boil up once, 
thicken with browned flour ; add the giblets chopped fine ; 
boil again, and send up in a gravy-boat. 

Should there be more gravy than you need, set it away 
carefully. Each day brings forth a need for such. 

Crab-apple Jelly 
Is a pleasing sauce for roast fowls. 

Stewed Celery. 
Select the best blanched stalks, and lay aside in cold 
water. Stew three or four stalks of the coarser parts, 
minced, with a small onion, a few sprigs of ]iarsley, also 
chopped, and a bone of ham, or other meat. Stew for an 
hour in enough water to cover them ; strain, pressing hard. 
Cut the choicer celery into pieces two inches long ; pour 
over them the " stock " from the straitier, season with pep- 
per, and, if needed, salt. Stew until very tender. Stir in a 
good tablespoonful of butter, and a little corn-starch, wet 
up in cold water. Simmer gently three minutes, and dish. 

Fried Salsify. 

Scrape and lay in cold water ten minutes. Boil tender, 

drain, and when cold, mash with a wooden spoon, picking 

out the fibrous parts. Wet to a paste with milk, work in 

a little butter, and an egg and a half for each cupful of 



74 JANUARY. 

salsify. Beat the eggs very light. Season to taste, make 
into round, flat cakes, dredge with flour, and fry to a light 
brown. Drain ofif the fat, and serve hot. 

Margherita Lemon Custard. 

5 eggs. 

I quart of milk. 

Half the grated peel of a lemon. 

5 tablespoonfuls of white sugar. 
Beat the whites of two eggs and the. yolks of five very 
light ; add the sugar and pour over these the milk, scald- 
ing hot. Lastly, put in the grated peel, pour into a but- 
tered pudding-dish, and set in a pan of hot water. Put 
both into the oven, and bake the custard until it is well 
" set." Then spread with a meringue made of the re- 
served whites beaten stiff with a little powdered sugar. 
Shut the oven door, and cook the meringue until slightly 
tinged with yellow-brown. Eat cold. 



English Soup. 
Mutton Chops, Broiled. Browned Potato. 

Stewed Tomatoes. Sweet Pickles. 



Orange Fritters with Beehive Sauce.

English Soup. 
6 lbs. brisket of beef, cut into thin strips. 
2 onions, sliced and fried in dripping. 
The bones of yesterday's chickens. 

2 carrots. 

3 turnips. 

4 stalks of celery. 

I bunch of sweet herbs. 



THIRD WEEK—SATURDAY. 75 

\ lb. of vermicelli. 

Pepper and salt at discretion, 

6 quarts of cold water. 
Put the beef, cut into strips, the "carcasses" of the 
chickens broken to pieces, and three quarts of cold water, 
into a large soup-pot, and heat gradually. When it boils, 
skim well, and add the fried onion and other vegetables, 
cut fine, and three quarts more of cold water. Stew, with 
the pot-lid on, five hours, after it again boils, giving it no 
attention save to see that it never boils fast, and that the 
liquid has not diminished to less than three-quarters of the 
original quantity. Strain at the end of this time, first tak- 
ing out the meat that has not boiled to shreds, and the 
bones. Rub the vegetables through the colander ; after- 
wards strain the soup again through your wire strainer or 
sieve, into the kettle when you have washed it out. Sea- 
son, and simmer ten minutes after the boil recommences, 
skimming often. Break the vermicelli into short lengths, 
put into the soup when you have taken out two quarts 
for Sunday's " stock." Cook gently twelve minutes after 
the vermicelli goes in. 

At first glance, the quantity of meat prescribed for this 
soup may seem extravagant ; but, apart from the fact that 
the coarser and cheaper quality is used, you must note 
that you have now the foundation of three days' soups, 
and that you have saved time, no less than money, by 
making this as I have directed. It is by the long, intelli- 
gent look ahead that the mistress proves her right to the 
title. 

Mutton Chops — Broiled. 

Next to beef, good mutton, properly cooked, deserves 
the most prominent place among the meats upon your 
weekly bill of fare. It is digestible, nutritious, and, as a 
rule, popular. 1 therefore offer no apology for the regu- 
lar and frequent appearance of these two standard articles 
of diet upon these pages. They may well be named the 
two staves of healthful existence — for civilized humanity, 
at least. 

Trim your mutton chops, if your butcher has neglected 
to do it, leaving a naked end of bone as a " handle " upon 



^6 JANUARY. 

each. Lay them for fifteen minutes in a little melted 
butter, turning them several times. Then hold each up 
for a moment, to let all the butter drip off that will, and 
broil over a clear fire, watching constantly and turning 
them often when the falling fat threatens a blaze from be- 
low. If your gridiron is beneath the grate, they can be 
cooked far more satisfactorily, -and with one-tenth of the 
trouble. Pepper and salt when they ar^ laid upon a hot 
dish, and put a bit of butter upon each. 

Sweet Pickles 
" Go " well with broiled chops. For receipts for these 
and other pickles, with preserves and fruit jellies, the 
reader is respectfully referred to " Common Sense in 
THE Household, No. i, General Receipts." 

Browned Potato. 
Mash your potatoes with milk, butter, and salt ; heap 
as irregularly as possible in a vegetable dish, and hold a 
red-hot shovel close to them. They will brown more 
quickly if you glaze them with butter so soon as a crust 
is formed "by the hot shovel, then heat it again and repeat 
the browning. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 
To one can of tomatoes allow a saltspoonful of salt, 
half as much pepper, a teaspoonful of sugar, and a great 
tablespoonful of butter. Drain oflf half the liquor, season 
thus, and stew /a^/ for twenty minutes, in a vessel set 
within another filled with water on the hard boil. This 
receipt was given to me by a notable housewife. It is 
worth trying for her sake — and variety's. 

Orange Fritters. 

3 cups of milk. 

2 cups of prepared flour. 

4 eggs. 

A little salt. 

Lard for frying. 

6 or 8 sweet oranges. 

A httle powdered sugar. 



THIRD WEEK— SATURDAY. 77 

Take the peel and thick white skin from the oranges. 
Slice, and take out the seeds. Make a batter of the in- 
gredients given above, taking care not to get it too thin. 
Dip each slice in this dexterously and fry in boiling lard. 
Drain in a hot colander, and eat with the sauce given 
below. 

Beehive Sauce. 

\ cup of butter. 

2 cups of sugar. 

Juice and peel of a lemon. 

JJ- teaspoonful of nutmeg. 

\ cup of currant jelly, or cranberry syrup. 

. Make hard sauce in the -usual way by creaming the but- 
ter and sugar. Before beating in the lemon-juice and 
nutmeg, set aside three tablespoon fuls to be colored. 
Having added lemon and spice to the larger quantity, 
color the less by whipping in currant jelly or cranberry 
syrup, until it is of a rich pink. Shape the white sauce 
into a conical mound. Roll a sheet of note paper into 
a long, narrow funnel, tie a string about it to keep it in 
shape, and fill with colored sauce. Squeeze it gently 
through the aperture at the small end, beginning at the 
base, and winding round the cone to the top, guiding it 
so that the white will show prettily between the pink 
ridges. 

The effect is pleasing and costs little trouble to pro- 
duce. 

Coffee 

Is believed by some to aid digestion, and, since fritters 
are not generally classed among very wholesome dainties, 
it may be as well to give John and John's wife — not the 
children — a cup of the fragrant elixir as a possible pre- 
ventive against an attack of dyspepsia. It always lends 
grace even to a homely dinner.

German Sago Soup. 
Soak half a cup of German' sago in enough water to' 
cover it entirely for two hours. Heat yesterday's soup 
to boiling, with a little of the reserved "stock," should the 
supply be too small ; stir in the sago with a little salt, 
until dissolved, and serve. 

Boiled Turkey and Oyster Sauce. 

IS oysters. 

A little milk, bread-crumbs, butter and seasoning. 

Wheat flour. 
Chop about fifteen oysters and work up with them 
bread-crumbs, a spoonful of butter, with pepper and salt. 
Stuff the turkey as for roasting ; sew it up, neatly, in a thin 
cloth fitted to every part, having dredged the cloth well 
inside with flour. Boil slowly, especially at first, allowing 
fifteen minutes to a pound. The water should be luke- 
warm when the turkey goes in. Salt and save the liquor 
in which the fowl was boiled. 

Oyster Sauce. 
12 oysters, cut into thirds. 

1 cupful of milk. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

2 teaspoonfuls rice, or wheat flour. 
Flavoring to taste. 
Chopped parsley. 



FOURTH ^EEK—SUNDAY. 79 

Drain the liquor from the oysters before you cut them 
up. Boil the liquor two minutes, and add the milk. 
When this is scalding Hot, strain and return to the sauce- 
pan. Wet the flour with cold water and stir into the 
sauce. As it thickens, put in the butter, then pepper and 
salt, with a very little parsley. The juice of a half a 
lemon is a pleasant flavoring. Stir it in after taking the 
sauce from the fire. Before this, and so soon as the flour 
is well incorporated with the other ingredients, add the 
oysters, each cut into three pieces. Simmer five minutes 
and pour into a gravy-tureen. Some also pour a little 
over the turkey on the dish. Garnish with slices of boiled 
egg and celery tops. 



Savory Rice Pudding. 

I teacupful of rice. 

Giblets of the turkey. 

A slice of fat salt pork, chopped very fine. 

Half a small onion, also minced. 

I small cup of milk. 

I tablespoonful of butter. 

Pepper and salt. 

Wash the rice thoroughly ; clean the giblets ; soak 
them an hour in salted water, cut each into several 
pieces, and put on to stew with the pork and rice in nearly 
a quart of cold water. Cook slowly until the giblets are 
tender and the rice soft. The grains should be kept as 
whole as possible, so do not use a spoon in stirring, but 
shake up the saucepan, which should be set in another 
of boiUng water. The rice should, by this time, be nearly 
dry. Take out the giblets and chop fine. Pour on the 
rice the milk, previously heated with the minced onions, 
and then strained. When this is again scalding, stir in 
the giblets, then the butter and seasoning. Cover and 
simmer for ten minutes. Wet a round or oval pan with 
cold water ; press the rice firmly into it, so that it may 
take the shape, and turn out carefully upon a flat dish. 
Set in the oven for two minutes before sending to table. 
It should be stifi' enough to take the mould, yet not dry. 



8o JANUARY. 

Potatoes au MaItre d'H6tel. 
Slice cold boiled potatoes a quarter of an inch thick, 
and put into a saucepan containing enough milk, already 
heated, to cover them — barely. When all are smoking 
hot, add a tablespoonful or more of butter, pepper, salt, 
and minced parsley. Add a teaspoonful of flour wet in 
cold water; heat quickly to a boil ; put in the juice of half 
a lemon ; pour into a deep dish without further cooking. 

Celery and Grape Jelly 
Should flank the castor, or tpergne, or whatever may 
be your centre-piece. 

Mince Pie. 

A receipt for mince-meat will be found in the proper 
order in the menu for next December. I take it for 
granted that, like the wise woman you are, you have laid 
up in the store-room enough from your Christmas supply 
to last for some weeks to come. If not, let me advise 
you to get a box of "Atmore's Celebrated Mince- 
Meat," and fill your pastry-crusts, instead of repeating so 
soon the tedious operation so lately performed. It comes 
in neat, wooden cans, and is really good. If you like, you 
can add more sugar and brandy. N. B. — My John has a 
sweet tooth. Has yours ? 

Make the paste by rubbing into a quart of your best 
flour one-third of a pound of sweet lard. Chop it in with 
a broad knife, if you have plenty of time. Wet up with 
ice-water, roll out very thin, and cover with " dabs " of 
butter, also of the best. Fold into a tight roll, flatten with 
a few strokes of the rolling-pin, and roll out into a sheet 
as thin as the first ; baste again with the butter ; roll up 
and out into a third sheet hardly thicker than drawing- 
paper ; a third time dot with butter, and fold up closely. 
Having used as much butter for this purpose as you have 
lard, set aside your last roll for an hour in a very cold 
place. Then roll out, line your pie-plates with the paste, 
fill with mince-meat ; put strips, cut with a jagging-iron, 
across them in squares or triangles, and bake in a steady, 
never a dull, heat. 



FOURTH WEEK— MONDAY. 8 1 

These pies, like all others, must be made on Saturday, 
and warmed up for Sabbath — unless you prefer to line 
your plates on Saturday, and set them aside until next 
day, then fill the raw, crisp paste with the mince-meat, 
and bake. The paste will be the better, instead of worse, 
for standing overnight, and the trouble of baking scarcely 
• exceed that of warming over. 

Bananas and Oranges 

May solace the disappointment of the dyspeptic or very 
juvenile members of the family party, who " dare not touch 
mince pie."

Sweet Potatoes, Baked. Brussels Sprouts. 



Sweet Macaroni, with Brandied Fruit. 
Chocolate. 



Combination Soup. 

Put the remains of yesterda/s soup and of the stock 
reserved on Saturday together, and heat almost to boiling. 
Split and -toast crisp half a dozen Boston crackers ; butter 
while hot, set in the oven until the butter has soaked in, 
when put on more. Lay in the bottom of your soup- 
tureen, wet with a little boiling milk, and when they have 
soaked this up, pour on the soup. 

Mince of Fowl. 

Set what was left of yesterday's oyster-sauce over the 
fire to heat, thinning, if necessary, with a little milk. Or, 
if you have no sauce, substitute a cupful of drawn butter, 
made from the liquor in which the turkey was boiled on 



82 JANUARY. 

Sunday, reserving the rest for another day's soup. Cut 
the meat closely from the bones of the turkey (saving 
these, also). Set aside the white flesh for a nice little dish 
of salad. Cut' the rest, freed from skin and gristle, into 
pieces of nearly uniform length, not more than an inch 
long. When your sauce boils, put in the meat, simmer 
until smoking hot, then take off the saucepan, and pour 
gradually over two beaten eggs. Cover the bottom of a 
pudding-dish with bread-crumbs, when you have greased it 
well ; season the mince to taste ; fill up the dish with it ; put 
another layer of bread-crumbs, on top, and stick bits of 
butter over these. Bake covered, until bubbling hot, then 
brown lightly. This will be found very delightful. 

Turkey Salad. 

The white meat of the turkey cut up in small pieces. 
An equal quantity of blanched celery, also cut into lengths. 
Salt slightly, and when dinner is nearly ready pour over 
them a dressing made of the yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs rubbed to a powder with a teaspoonful of sugar, 
half as much salt, pepper and made mustard, when 
worked into a paste with two tablespoonfuls of oil, and 
six of vinegar. Toss up the salad well with a silver fork, 
and garnish with white of egg cut into rings. 

Sweet Potatoes — Baked. 

Select those which are nearly of a size, and not too 
large, or so small as to shrivel into dry husks. Wash, 
wipe, and bake in a moderate oven until, by pinching, 
you find that they are soft at heart. 

Brussels Sprouts. 

Wash carefully, cut off the lower part of the stems, and 
lay in cold water, slightly salted, for half an hour. Cook 
quickly, in boiUng water, with a very little salt, for fifteen 
minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly, heap neatly 
upon a dish,_ and put a few spoonfuls of melted butter, 
peppered to taste, upon them. Eat hot.

4 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Nutmeg and vanilla. 

A little salt. 
Break the macaroni into short pieces, put into a farina- 
kettle, cover with the milk, put on the lid of the kettle, 
and cook with boiling water in the outer vessel, until the 
milk is soaked up and the macaroni looks clear, but has 
not begun to break. Add the butter, sugar, and flavor- 
ing, and, if you have it, a few spoonfuls of cream. If you 
have not, thicken a little milk slightly with corn-starch, 
and use instead. Cover, and set in the boiling water for 
ten minutes longer. Serve in a deep dish, and send around 
canned or brandied peaches with it. 

Chocolate. 
To one pint of boiling water allow six tablespoonfuls 
of grated chocolate wet up to a paste in cold water. 
Boil twenty minutes, put in one pint of milk and boil ten 
minutes more. Stir often. It saves lime, if you know 
the tastes of those who are to drink it, if you sweeten it 
in the saucepan.

Mother's Soup. 

Beefsteak and Onions. Sweet and Irish Potatoes, Chopped. 

Mixed Pickles. Corn and Tomatoes, Stewed. 



Creme du Tbg, Cafe et Chocolat. 



Motoer's Soup. 
Bones of yesterday's turkey, with the stuffing. 
A slice of lean ham. 



84 JANUARY. 

The bone from your steak, and half a can of sweet corn. 

I onion, small. 

I stalk of celery. 

Bunch of sweet herbs. 

Pepper and salt. 

3 quarts of water. 

Put on bones, ham (chopped), and the vegetables, cut 
up with the sweet herbs, but not the corn, in a soup-kettle ; 
cover well with the liquor in which the turkey was cooked, 
and boil slowly, untouched, two hours. Take out the 
bones, and strain the soup, rubbing the vegetables through 
the strainer, into a bowl. Return this to the fire and 
with it the corn and turkey dressing. Bring to a gentle 
boil and keep it steady, for fully half an hour. Season, 
and simmer a quarter of an hour longer. The corn and 
dressing will thicken it sufficiently. 

Beefsteak with Onions. 

While your steak is broiling, watched by some one else, 
fry three or four sliced onions in a pan with some beef 
dripping or butter. Stir and shake them until they begin 
to brown. Dish your steak, salt and pepper, and lay the 
onions on! top. Cover, and let all stand where they will 
keep ho* for five minutes. Do not help onions to any 
one unless you are sure that he likes them. 

The^e is no dish so good for keeping a steak hot, yet 
juicy, as a hot-water chafing-dish. No household can 
afford to be without one, if no more. 

Mixed Pickles 

Give the needed piquancy to steak. Home-made ones 
are best. 

Sweet and Irish Potatoes — .Chopped. 
Chop cold boiled Irish potatoes and mix with them the 
cold sweet ones left from Monday — in equal parts, if 
convenient— or, if you have but two or three, make tl^m 
do. There is philosophy, and religion, too, sometimes, 
in " making things do." Heating a little butter in a 
saucepan, stir in the potatoes when it begins to " fizzle."

Corn and Tomatoes Stewed. 

To a can of tomatoes add the half can of corn left from 
your soup. Stew together half an hour, with a little 
minced onion ; then pepper and salt to taste, and stir in 
a great spoonful of butter with a very little sugar. Simmer 
ten minutes before turning out. 

CrJime du Tnfi, Caf^ et Chocolat. 

I quart of milk. 

I package of Cooper's gelatine. 

1 cup of sugar. 

2 tablespoopfuls grated chocolate. 
1 cup strong tea. 

I cup of strong coffee. 

Soak the gelatine for an hour in a cup of cold water. 
Heat the milk to boiling and add the gelatine. So soon 
as this is dissolved, put in the sugar, stir until melted, 
and take the saucepan from the fire. Strain through thin 
muslin and divide into three parts. Into the largest stir 
the chocolate, rubbed smooth in cold water ; into another 
the tea, and into a third equal to the second, the coffee. 
Return that containing the chocolate to the farina-kettle, 
and heat scalding hot, stirring all the while. Rinse out 
the kettle well with boiling water, and put in, successively, 
those portions flavored with th^ tea and the coffee, scald- 
ing the vessel between each. Wet several small cups or 
glasses with cold water. Pour the chocolate into some, 
the tea into others, and the coffee blancmange into the 
rest. When cold, turn out upon a flat dish, and eat with 
sugar and sweet cream. It will "form" in about six 
hours. This is a dessert by no means tedious or difficult 
of preparation, and is worth trying, being both dainty and 
wholesome.

Lexington Soup. 

2 lbs. of veal. 

I lb. of mutton, with some bones. 

I onion. 

I carrot. 

\ cup of rice. 

I cup of split peas. 

4 quarts of water. 

Sweet herbs, pepper and salt. 

Mince the meat and vegetables and crack the bones. 
The peas should have been soaked overnight in soft 
water, the rice washed and picked over. Put all together 
in your soup-kettle, pour in the water and stew gently, 
covered, five hours. Should the water waste too much, 
put in more from the tea-kettle. At the end of this time, 
strain, rubbing the vegetables through a colander. Return 
to the fire, season, and boil slowly ten minutes, skimming 
carefully. Put sliced lerpon, from which the yellow rind 
has been pared, into the tureen, and pour the soup upon 
it. Serve a slice in each plateful. 

Boiled Chickens and Macaroni. 

Clean, wash, and stuff your chickens as for roasting ; 
sew each up in a piece of new tarlatan, fitted snugly to 
the shape. Boil, putting them down in pretty hot, but 
not scalding water, allowing twelve minutes to the num- 
ber of pounds in one of the pair, and that the larger. 
About half an hour before they are to be served take out 



FOURTH WEEK— WEDNESDAY. 8/ 

a large cupful of the liquor from the pot and put into a 
saucepan. Season it, and boil for five minutes with a 
small chopped onion. Strain, and when again hot, drop 
in a double handful of macaroni, broken into short lengths. 
Cook until tender, by which time the liquor should be ab- 
sorbed by the macaroni. The saucepan should be set in 
another, holding boiling water, that there may be no 
danger of scorching while stewing. Make a flattened 
mound of the macaroni upon a hot dish ; lay the chickens 
upon it, and anoint them well with melted butter, made 
more salt than usual. Serve them out together, and have 
grated cheese for such as wish it. 

Chow-Chow, 
Or " picklette," in American store-rooms — is a keen appe- 
tizer and especially harmonious with boiled fowls. For 
receipt for making in winter or summer, see " General 
Receipts, No. i, Common Sense Series," page 491. 

Parsnip Cakes. 
Scrape, wash, boil, and mash the parsnips. When cold, 
season with salt and pepper, and, flouring your hands, 
make thera into small, flat cakes. Roll in flour and fry 
in boiling dripping. Drain dry and send up on a hot 
dish. 

Whipped Potatoes. 
Instead of mashing the potatoes in the ordinary way, 
whip with a fork until light and dry. Then whip in a 
little melted butter and some milk with salt to taste, beat- 
ing up fast until you have a creamy compound, almost 
like a meringue. Pile as lightly and irregularly as you 
can upon a hot dish. 

Jam Roley-Poley. 
I quart oi prepared flour. 

1 tablespoonful of butter and the same of lard. 

2 cups of milk, or enough to make soft dough. 
I large cup of fruit or berry jam. 

Rub lard and butter into the flour, with a little salt, and 



88 JANUARY. 

wet with cold milk into a soft paste. Roll out into a 
pretty thick crust — say about a quarter of an inch — and 
trim into an oblong sheet. Spread this generously with 
jam, leaving a margin at each end. Roll up closely, the 
fruit inside. Pinch the open ends together, and baste 
neatly in a floured bag fitted to the roll, but not so tightly 
as to interfere with the swelling of the pudding. Boil an 
hour and a half in hot water that, from first to last, is not 
once oflf the boil. Dip the cloth into cold water before 
attempting to turn the roley:poley out — but for one hasty 
second only. 

Wine Sauce. 

3 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

2 cupfuls of powdered sugar. 

\ cup of wine. 

Grated peel of half a lemon. 

\ cupful of boiling water. 

I teaspoonful of corn-starch. 

Nutmeg. 
Cream the butter and sugar, adding the boiling water, 
a little at a time, until you have used the half cupful. 
Put on in a saucepan, and stir in the corn-starch wet up 
with cold milk. When it has thickened, put in the lemon- 
peel and nutmeg. Simmer one minute, add the wine, 
put on the lid of the saucepan and set in hot water to 
keep warm until wanted. 

Apples and Nuts, 

Being cheap and abundant at this season, should form the 
sequel of many dinners.

liquor and simmer three hours, until the three quarts are 
reduced to two. Strain the liquor ; put back into the 
pot ; salt and pepper ; boil gently and skim for ten min- 
utes before adding the milk and boiled farina. Simmer 
another ten minutes ; take out a cupful and pour over 
the beaten egg. Mix well, and put with the soup ; let all 
stand covered, off the fire, two minutes, and serve. 

Langue de Bceuf, or Beef's Tongue. 

Get your butcher to save you a fresh, large beefs 
tongue, the finest he can get. Soak, in cold water, a little 
salt, six hours — overnight, if you choose — changing the 
water before you go to bed. Wipe it, trim and scrape it, 
and plunging into boiling water, keep it at a slow boil for 
an hour and a half. Take it up, pepper and salt ; brush 



go JANUARY. 

over with beaten egg and coat thickly with bread-crambs ; 
lay in your dripping-pan and bake, basting often with but- 
ter melted in a little water. Half an hour in a good oven 
should suffice. Put on a hot dish and cover while you 
prepare the sauce. 

Sauce Piquante. 

1 cupful of the liquor in which the tongue was boiled. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

I teaspoonful of made mustard. 

A littie salt and pepper. 

I heaping tablespoonful of browned flour. 

I teaspoonful mixed parsley and sweet marjoram.

Brown the butter by shaking it over a clear fire in a 
saucepan. Heat the cupful of liquor to a boil, skim and 
season it with salt and jiepper. Skim again before stir- 
ring in the flour wet up with cold water. As it thickens, 
put in the butter, herbs, mustard, and vinegar. Boil up, 
pour half over the tongue, the rest into a sauce-boat. 

Fried Brains and Green Peas. 

Open a can of green peas an hour before cooking them, 
and turn into a bowl. If there is not liquor in the can to 
cover them, add a little water, slightly salted, and cook 
over twenty minutes after they boil. Drain, pepper and 
salt ; stir in a lump of butter nearly as large as an egg, 
and put into a vegetable dish, the fried brains arranged 
along the base of the mound. 

Wash a calf's brains in several waters ; scald in boil- 
ing, then lay in ice-cold water, for half an hour. Wipe, 
and beat them into a paste ; season, work in a little 
butter, a beaten egg, and enough flour, to hold the paste 
together. Fry upon a griddle in small Cakes. Drain ofi' 
every drop of fat. Eat hot. 

A nice and savory garnish. 

Hominy Croquettes. 
2 cups fine hominy, boiled and cold. 
2 beaten eggs. 



FOURTH WEEK— THURSDAY. QI 

I tablespoonful of melted butter. 

Salt to taste. 

I teaspoonful of sugar. 
Work the butter into the hominy until the latter is 
smooth ; then the eggs, salt and sugar. Beat hard with a 
wooden spoon to get out lumps and mix well. Make 
into oval balls with floured hands. Roll each in flour, 
and fry in sweet dripping or lard, putting in a few at a 
time and turning over with care as they brown. Drain 
in a hot colander. 

Cold Slaw. 
Chop or shred a small white cabbage. Prepare a dress- 
ing in the proportion of one tablespoonful of oil to four 
of vinegar, a teaspoonful of made mustard, the same 
quantity of salt and sugar, and half as much pepper. 
Pour over the salad, adding, if you choose, three table- 
spoonfuls of minced celery ; toss up well and put into a 
glass bowl. 

Brown Betty. 

2 cups chopped apples, tart ones. 
\ cup of sugar. 

1 cup of bread-crumbs. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 
I teaspoonful of nutmeg. 

Put a layer, of chogp^ apple in the bottom of a 
buttered pudding-dish.' Sprinkle well with sugar, stick 
bits of butter here and there and add a pinch or two of 
nutmeg. Cover with bread-crumbs, then more apple. 
In this order of alternation fill the dish, spreading the 
surface with bread-crumbs. Cover, steam nearly an hour 
in a moderate oven ; then brown quickly. 

•For sauce, mix a teaspoonful of cinnamon with a cup 
of powdered sugar. Butter the hot "Betty" as you fill 
each- saucer, and strew with this mixture. Or it is excel- 
lent, eaten warm, not hot, with cream and sugar.

4 tablespoonfuls of butter, cut into bits and rolled in 

flour. 

1 bunch of sweet herbs. 

I lump of white sugar. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

3 quarts of water. 

Fried bread. 

Parboil the potatoes ; then slice and put them into the 
soup-pot with the tomatoes, the onions, minced, and the 
celery and herbs chopped small. Pour on three quarts 
of water, and stew for one hour, or until the vegetables 
can be rubbed easily through the colander. Strain, re- 
turn to the pot, drop in the sugar, pepper and salt judi- 
ciously, boil up and skim. Stir in the butter, and simmer, 
covered, for ten minutes. Have dice of fried bread in the 
tureen, upon which pour the soup. 

Fried Oysters. 

Select for this the finest oysters. Drain, and wipe 
them by spreading them upon a cloth, laying another 
over them, and pressing lightly. Roll each in beaten 
egg, then in cracker-crumbs with which have been mixed 
a little salt and less pepper, and fry in a mixture of equal 
parts of lard and butter. 



FOURTH WEEK— FRIDAY. 93 

Drain each in a wire spoon, and eat them hot, with 
bread and butter. 

Roast Mutton. 
Wash the meat well and wipe with a clean cloth. Put 
into the dripping-pan, pour a cup of boiling water over it, 
and roast, basting often, for a while, with salt and water, 
afterwards with its own gravy. Allow twelve minutes to 
each pound of meat, and keep the fire at a steady, moder- 
ate heat. Should it brown too fast, cover with a sheet 
of paper. Take up the meat, put it on a hot dish ; 
thicken the gravy with browned flour, having first taken 
off all the fat you can — season with pepper and salt, boil 
up, skim and serve. Pass currant jelly with it. 

Spinach i la CrJime. 
Pick over and wash the spinach, and cut the leaves 
from the stalks. Boil in hot water, a little salted, about 
twenty minutes. Drain, put into a wooden tray, or upon 
a board ; chop very fine, and rub through a colander. 
Put into a saucepan ; stir until it begins to smoke through- 
out. Add then two tablespoonfuls of butter for a good- 
sized dish, a teaspoonful of white sugar, three tablespoon- 
fuls of milk, salt and pepper to liking. Beat, as it heats, 
with a silver fork or wire spoon. Some put in a little 
nutmeg, and most people like it. Cook thus until it 
begins to bubble up as you Beat it. Pour into a deep 
dish, surround with sliced egg, and serve. 

Potatoes Stewed Whole. 
Pare the potatoes and boil in water which was cold 
when they went in; When they are done, as is proved 
by piercing the largest with a fork, turn off the water, and 
cover them barely with milk already heated. Stew in 
this five minutes ; take the potatoes out, and put into a 
covered deep dish. Add to the milk in the saucepan a 
good lump of butter, rolled in flour, some chopped 
parsley, pepper and salt. Boil up once. Crack each 
potato as it lies in the dish, by pressing with the back of 
a spoon ; pour the hot milk over them ; let them stand 
three minutes in it, and send to table.

A pinch of salt. 
Soak the tapioca in the water five hours. Heat the 
milk to scalding ; add the tapioca, the water in which it 
was soaked, and the salt. -Stir to boiling, and pour gradu- 
ally upon the yolks and sugar, which should have been 
beaten together. Boil again, stirring constantly, about 
five minutes, or until it begins to thicken well. Turn 
into a bowl and stir gently into the custard the frothed 
whites and the flavoring. Eat cold.

FOURTH WEEK— SATURDAY. 95 

Clean the hare carefully and cut to pieces, cracking all 
the bones. Put into the soup-kettle with the mutton- 
bones, the bacon, onion, and parsley. Pour on three 
quarts of cold water ; put on the lid tightly, and stew 
four hours very slowly. Bj' this time the meat should be 
in shreds. Strain it, return to the fire, season it, stew and 
skim five minutes. Slice three boiled eggs and, put iato 
the tureen and pour the soup over them. 

Hot Pot. 
Put into a deep bake-dish a layer of cold mutton left from 
your roast, freed from fat and skin and cut into strips two 
inches long by one wide. Overlay these with slices of 
parboiled potatoes, a little minced onion, an oyster or 
two chopped, some tiny bits of butter, with salt and 
pepper. Repeat this process until your meat is used up. 
The top layer should be potatoes. Add a cupful of 
gravy from Friday's dinner (or elsewhere), cover very 
closely and bake one hour before Ufting the lid. Peep in 
to see if the contents are done — they will be if your fire 
is tolerably strong. Turn out into a deep dish. 

Cucumber Pickles 
Are a better condiment for this dish than any others. 

Turnips with White Sauce. 
Peel and quarter your turnips. Leave in cold water 
half an hour. Put on in hot water, and boil until tender. 
Drain and cover with a sauce prepared by heating a cup 
of milk, thickening it with a heaping teaspoonful of corn- 
starch, and stirring in a great spoonful of butter with pep- 
per and salt to season it well. Put this, when you have 
added the turnips, into a vessel set within another of 
boiling water, and let them stand covered, without cook- 
ing, ten minutes before serving. 

Boiled Rice au Geneve. 
Pick over and wash the rice, and boil in a farina-kettle, 
with enough cold water, a little salted, to cover it an inch 
deep. Shake now and then as the rice swells. Take from 



g6 JANUARY. 

your hare soup, when you have strained it, a cupful of 
the liquor and about half as much of the boiled shreds of 
meat. Chop these extremely fine, season with salt and 
pepper. Heat the cup of liquor to a boil, stir into it a 
scant tablespoonful of browned flour, then the chopped 
meat and a tablespoonful of butter, and stew gently five 
minutes. Pile the boiled rice, which should be almost 
dry, in a dish, and pour the gravy over it. It is very 
savory, and makes a pleasant variety in the list of winter 
vegetables.

Clear Vermicelli Soup. 

6 lbs. of veal — the knuckle is best. 

I lb. of lean ham, cut fine. 

I bunch of sweet herbs. 

J lb. of vermicelli. 

5 quarts of water. 

Pepper and salt with half a teaspoonful ground mace. 

Cut the meat from the bones in thin shreds, and crack 
the bones to spUnters. Mince the ham and herbs. Put 
into a soup-kettle, add the water, cover very tightly with 
a weight upon the lid, and stand where it will slowly boil, 
for five hours. Then turn into a jar, salt and pepper, and 
shut up while hot. Leave the jar all Saturday night upon 
the side of the range, where it will keep warm until morn- 
ing. Pour into a bowl before breakfast and let it get cold. 
Take off the cake of fat two hours before dinner, turn the 
soup-jelly, bones and all, into the soup-pot, and when it is 
melted strain through your wire sieve. Put in the mace, 
boil for an hour and a half, and skim. Put the vermicelli, 
already broken into short bits and boiled tender, into the 
tureen (but not the water in which it was boiled) and 
strain the soup over it through double tarlatan. Let ' it 
stand ten minutes before serving. This is a showy soup, 
and easily made, really requiring little attention.

98 FEBRUARY. 

Stewed Ducks. 

On Saturday, draw, wash, and stuff your ducks, adding 
a touch of onion and sage to the dressing. On Saturday, 
also, make a gravy of the giblets, cut small, an onion, 
sliced, with a pint of %^ater. Stew, closely covered, for 
two hours ; take off, season, and set away with the giblets 
in it still. - Next day — on Sunday— lay the ducks in the 
dripping-pan, put in the gravy, adding water if there is not 
enough to half cover the fowls, at least. Invert another 
pan of the same size over them, and let them stew, at a 
moderate heat, for two hours. Or, you can put them into 
a large saucepan, pwur in the gravy, fit on the lid, and 
cook upon the range for the same time. In either case 
they will take care of themselves, as will the soup, if 
Bridget be reasonably obedient to orders, while you go 
to church. When the ducks are done, lay them upon a 
hot dish, thicken the gravy with browned flour, add a 
glass of brown sherry and the juice of a lemon. Lay 
three-cornered bits of fried bread around the inside of the 
dish, and pour the gravy over all. 



Fried Apples and Bacon. 

Pare, core, and slice round, some well-flavored pippins, 
or greenings. Cut into thin slices some streaked middling 
of excellent bacon, and fry in their own fat almost to crisp- 
ness. Take out the meat and arrange it upon a hot chaf- 
ing-dish, while you fry the apples in the fat left in the pan 
from the bacon. Drain and lay upon the slices of meat. 

This is a Southern dish, and not so homely as it would 
seem from the mere reading. 



Potatoes i la Reine. 

Mash as usual, beating up light with butter and milk, 
but not so soft as not to take any shape you like to give 
them. Make a rounded hillock, or a four-sided pyramid 
of them upon a flat dish. Brush this all over with beaten 
yolk of egg, set in the oven a few minutes to harden the 
coating, and send to table. 



FIRST WEEK— SUNDAY. 99 

Mashed Carrots. 

Scrape, wash, lay in cold water half an hour; then 
cook tender in boiling water. Drain well, mash with a 
wooden spoon, or beetle, work in a good piece of butter, 
and season with pepper and salt. Heap up in a vege- 
table dish, and serve very hot. 

Potato Pik. 

1 lb. mashed potato, rubbed through a colander. 
J lb. of butter, creamed with the sugar. 
6 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately. 
I lemon, squeezed into the potato while hot. 

1 teaspoonful of nutmeg and the same of mace. 

2 cups of white sugar. 

Cream the butter and sugar ; add the yolks, the spice, 
and beat in the potato gradually until it is very light. At 
last, whip" in the whites. Bake in open shells of paste. 
Eat cold. 

When making these pies on Saturday — forecasting Mon- 
day's needs and superabundance of cares — prepare more 
pastry than you need for the two large pies which the 
above quantity of potato mixture will fill, and set aside a 
trim roll of raw crust to be rolled out in due time — we 
shall see to what end. I take it for granted (once more) 
that all of Sunday's receipts will be diligently conned on 
the day when the old distich tells us, even " lazy people 
work the best." 

This potato pie will be pronotinced delicious. 

Oranges and Bananas. 

These will make a pretty finish to what I flatter myself 
with the hope that you will find a good, and not inelegant 
repast.

soup, taste, and supply what seasoning is needed ; lift 
from the fire and leave covered five minutes before pour- 
ing into the tureen. 

Duck Patk. 

Cut the meat from the bones of yesterday's ducks, in 
season to make gravy. Do this by breaking the skeletons 
to pieces, and putting . them, with the stuffing, into a 
saucepan, pouring in a quart of cold water, and letting it 
in two hours boil down to half as much, or even one- 
third. Boil slowly, with the lid slightly lifted after the 
boihng begins. Let this get cold ; skim and season. In 
the bottom of a pudding-dish put some neat slices of duck ; 
on this a layer of boiled egg sliced thin ; then, a few 
slices of corned tongue. (That of a calf will do as well 
as beef, and be cheaper. It should be boiled and cold.) 
Sprinkle each layer with pepper and a little salt, with a 
tiny pinch of mace upon the tongue. When your mate- 
rials are used up, pour in the gravy, and, just before it 
goes into the oven, cover with a crust of pastry kept over 
from Saturday. Bake about three-quarters of an hour for 
a large dish — half an hour for one of medium size. There 



FIRST WEEK--MONDAY. lOI 

must be a slit in ■ the centre of, the crust to let out the 
steam. 

By proper foresight, the manufacture of this very pala- 
table pie will consume but little of a busy woman's time 
on Monday. Do not forget that with gravies and soups, 
after you have placed them over the fire in a well-chosen 
location, they will need nothing more than a hasty glance 
for, perhaps, several hours, during which much work in 
other parts of the household can be done. 

Sweet Potatoes, Boiled. 

It is poor economy, in buying sweet or Irish potatoes, 
to get either very large or very small ones. So, in cook- 
ing, select those of uniform size. Put on in hot water ; 
boil until a fork will go easily into the largest. Peel 
quickly and set in the oven for' a few minutes to dry. Eat 
hot, with butter. 

Succotash. 

I can of sweet corn. 

I can of string beans. 

I great spoonful of butter. 

Pepper and salt. 

I cup of milk. 

A little flour. 
Cut the beans into inch lengths ; put them into a sauce- 
pan with the corn, and cover with cold water. Stew half 
an hour, after they begin to cook, turn off most of the 
water and put in the milk — cold. When it is hot, stir in 
the butter, rolled in flour. Season, simmer for five min- 
utes, and pour into a deep dish. 

This will make a large quantity of sUccotash for a small 
family, but what is not eaten will be nice warmed over for 
breakfast. 

Cup Custards — Boiled. 

I quart of milk. 

Yolks of s eggs and whites of 3 (reserving 2 for the 

miringue). 
6 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Vanilla flavoring, i teaspoonful to the pint. 



102 FEBRUARY. 

Heat the milk almost to boiling. Take out a cupful 
and add, slowly, to the beaten yolks and sugar, whipped 
up with three of the whites. Return to the fire and stir 
until it begins to thicken, but not until it curdles. Pour 
into a bowl and, when cold, flavor. Fill glass, or china 
cups with it. Whip the reserved whites to a miringue 
with a little powdered sugar, and heap a spoonful upon 
the top of each cup. 

Watch your opportunity for boiling the custard. I have 
often slipped into the kitchen and made it while the coffee 
was boiling for breakfast. This once ofif the fire, no more 
cooking is needed. 

Cut, or Fancy Cake, 

Of which every housewife keeps a supply in her pantry, 
for luncheon and tea, makes, with these custards, a nice 
dessert, to which you need never be ashamed to seat John 
and his friends.

Family Soup. 
Rolled Beef. Baked Tomatoes. 

Browned Potatoes Whole. Apple Sauce. 



Unity Pudding. 
Cream Sauce. 



Family Soup. 

2 lbs. fresh beef bones, broken small. 
1 lb. calf's liver, sliced. 

I slice of ham, minced. 

I lb. of coarse mutton, also minced. 

I turnip. 

3 stalks of celery. 
I onion. 



FIRST WEEK— TUESDAY. IO3 

Bunch sweet herbs. 

i cup of raw rice. « 

Pepper and salt. 

4 quarts of cold water. 

Put the cracked bones, the meat, and the chopped 
vegetables into the soup-pot, and cover with the water. 
The liver should he in salted water one hour before it is 
sliced. Stew very slowly five hours. Then strain, rub- 
bing hard ; cool enough to bring the fat to the top. Take 
it off, season the soup, put over the fire, and when it 
boils stir in the rice, previously cooked soft in a little 
salted water. Simmer together half an hour, and pour 
out. - 

Rolled Beef. 

Get a fillet of beef — that is, the tenderloin of several 
steaks cut in one piece. It will no{ be cheap, but there 
will be no waste. Therefore, as one weighing four or five 
pounds will make a roast for one day, your dinner will 
not be really expensive. Roll it up round ; pin tightly 
with skewers not to be removed, except by the carver, 
and roast with care, basting often that it may not dry up. 
Carve horizontally. 

Browned Potatoes — Whole. 

Peel and parboil some fine potatoes, and half an hour 
before your beef is taken up, lay' them in the dripping- 
pan. Baste with the meat and turn several times. Drain 
off the grease when they are done to a fine brown, and 
lay about the meat in the dish when it goes to table. 

Baked Tomatoes. 

Open a can of tomatoes, and turn into a bowl. After 
an hour, season them with a teaspoonful of sugar, half as 
much salt, a little pepper and a tablespoonful of butter 
cut into bits, each bit rolled in flour and all distributed 
evenly throughout the tomatoes. Cover with very dry 
bread-crumbs. Bake in a pudding-dish, covered, about 
thirty minutes, then brown on the upper grating of the 
oven. 



I04 FEBRUARY. " 

Apple Sauce. 

Make this on Saturday, by stewing sliced tart apples 
in a little water until soft, draining and mashing them, 
adding a bit of butter while doing this. Sweeten abun- 
dantly and season with nutmeg. 

Unity Pudding. 

I cup of milk. 

I tablespoonful of butter. 

I egg. 

I generous pint of prepared flour. 

1 cup of sugar. 

I saltspoonful of salt. 
Rub butter and sugar together ; beat in the egg, and 
■whip up very light. Then, milk and salt, finally the flour. 
Bake in a buttered mould, until a straw thrust into the 
thickest part comes out clean. Turn out upon a plate. 
Cut in slices and eat hot. 

If for this and other receipts which prescribe prepared 
flour, you cannot conveniently procure it, add one tea- 
spoonful of soda and two of cream of tartar to each quart 
of flour. Sift all several times through a sieve. You 
can keep this for a week or two in a dry place. 

Cream Sauce. 

2 cups rich milk — half cream, if you can get it. 
4 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Whites of 2 eggs whipped stiff. 
I teaspoonful extract of bitter almonds. 
\ teaspoonful of nutmeg. 

I even tablespoonful of corn-starch wet up with cold 
water. 

Heat the milk to scalding ; add the sugar, stir in the 
corn-starch. When it thickens beat in the stiffened 
■whites, then the seasoning. Take from the fire, and set 
in boiling water to keep warm — but not cook — until 
wanted.

I06 FEBRUARY. 

Strain off the liquor and cover the chickens while you 
prepare the gravy. Put it into a large frying-pan. There 
will not be too much after the chickens are taken out of 
it. Add to it the parsley and chopped onion, with sea- 
soning. Boil up, thicken with browned flour ; stir in the 
butter and cook rapidly, stirring often, ten minutes. Ar- 
range the chickens upon a hot dish and pour the gravy 
over it. Let all stand for five minutes before sending to

buttered pudding-dish until brown. Serve in the dish in 
which it was cooked, and eat hot. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Select large, fair potatoes of equal size, wash, wipe and 
put into the oven to bake until soft all through. Send to 
table wrapped in a napkin. 

Stewed Salsify. 

Scrape and drop into cold water as fast as you clean 
them. Cut into inch lengths ; cover with hot water and 
stew tender. Turn off the water ; put in a cupful of cold 
milk. Stew in this ten minutes after the boil begins ; 
add a lump of butter rolled thickly in flour ; pepper and 
salt as you fancy. Boil up once and pour into a deep 
dish. 

Soft Gingerbread.

1 teaspoonful of cinnamon. 

2 eggs. 

Nearly 5 cups of sifted flour, enough for tolerably thick 
batter. 

Cream butter, sugar, molasses, and spice ; set the mix- 
ture on the range until lukewarm. Add the milk, then 
the beaten eggs, the soda, and at last the flour. Beat 
hard five minutes ; put in the fruit dredged with flour ; 
beat three minutes, and bake in small round tins. 

Eat warm all that is needed for dessert. The rest will 
keep well. This gingerbread is uncommonly fine. 

CAFfi AU Lait. 
2 cups strong made coffee — fresh and hot. 
2 cups of boiling milk. 
Strain the coffee from the boiler into the table coffee- 
pot, through thin muslin. Add the boiling milk and set '

I08 FEBRUARY. 

1 carrot. 

2 turnips. 
2 onions. 
Bunch of herbs. 

Handful of chopped cabbage. 

Pepper and salt. 

\ lb. of barley. 

4 quarts of cold water. 

Put on the meat, bones, and sweet herbs, to stew in 
four quarts of water. Do not disturb for four hours. 
Meanwhile, pare and cut the vegetables into dice, and 
boil until tender in just enough water to cover them. 
Drain this off and throw it away. Cover the vegetables 
with cold water, a little salt, and let them stand until 
you have strained the soup. This should be allowed to 
cool to throw up the fat. Skim it with care ; put back 
over the fire. Salt and pepper, boil up, and skim again 
before putting in the vegetables, without the water in 
which they have been standing. The barley should, all 
this time, be soaking in warm water, just deep enough to 
cover it. Turn it now, with the water in which it has Iain, 
into the soup. Let all simmer together one hour, and 
serve the vegetables in the soup. 

Baked Calf's Head. 
Take out the brains and set aside. Wash the head 
carefully. It should, of course, be cleaned with the skin 
on. Soak it in cold, salted water, one hour, then in hot 
water ten minutes. Boil iil three quarts of cold water 
for about an hour after the water begins to bubble. 
Take it out, saving the liquor when you have salted it, 
as 'stock for to-morrow's soup. Plunge the head into 
cold water for five minutes. Wipe carefully, put into 
your dripping-pan, brush it over with beaten egg, sprin- 
kle with bread-crumbs, and bake until nicely browned, 
basting three times with butter. Make a gravy of a cup- 
ful of the liquor, seasoned and thickened. Fry strips of 
ham, about an inch wide by four inches long, almost crisp 
in their own fat, and having laid the head upon a flat dish, 
dispose these about it. Serve a piece with each plate of 
the head. 



first weeic— thursday. io9 

French Beans and Fried Brains. 

Open a can of string-beans one hour at least before 
they are to be cooked. Cut into short pieces, cover with 
hot water, and stew thirty minutes, but not until they 
break. Drain well ; stir into them two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, in which have been mixed salt, pepper, 
and a tablespoonful of lemon-juice. Heap within a deep 
dish, and garnish with the brains. 

Wash the brains and lay in cold salt and water for an 
hour, then boil ten minutes. Leave in very cold water 
until firm — say a quarter of an hour. Wipe, and chop 
fine, add a little parsley, pepper and salt ; make into 
small cakes by flouring your hands ; dip in beaten egg, 
then in cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot dripping. Drain 
thoroughly. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 

Season a can of tomatoes with salt, pepper, sugar, and 
a little chopped onion. Stew for twenty-five minutes and 
stir in a large tablespoonful of butter. Simmer ten min- 
utes, and serve. 

Potatoes in Cases. 

Roast large potatoes. Cut off a piece from the top of 
each, and lay it aside. Empty the insides carefully by 
the help of a small spoon — not tearing the skins. To 
this potato, when mashed, add butter, grated cheese, pep- 
per and salt, as suits your taste. Bind the mixture with 
a beaten egg ; heat in a saucepan, stirring to prevent 
scorching ; refill the cases, fit on the top of each, and set 
in a hot oven three minutes before sending to table in a 
warm napkin. 

Snowballs. 

\ lb. raw rice. 
I quart fresh milk. 
5 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
A little nutmeg. 
Wash the rice in several waters, and boil in the milk 
(always in a farina-kettle), adding a little salt and five 



no FEBRUARY. 

tablespoonfuls of sugar, with a pinch of nutmeg. Stew 
gently until the rice is soft and has soaked up the milk. 
Fill small cups with the rice, pressing it down firmly, and 
let it get cold. At dinner-time, turn it out upon a, large 
flat dish, or pile within a glass bowl. Eat with sweet- 
ened cream. 

Sweet Cream. 

2 cups of cream. 

3 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 
2 teaspoonfuls of rose-water. 

Stir the sugar into the cream until it is dissolved ; then 
the rose-water.

1 cup of milk. 
Pepper and salt. 

I quart of cold water, and the liquor in which the calfs 
head was boiled, yesterday. 



FIRST WEEK— FRIDAY. Ill 

In bespeaking your calPs head from your butcher, ask 
also for four nice feet, already cleaned. (You can secure 
your sweetbreads at the same time. ) Put on the feet in 
a quart of cold water. Cover closely and heat gradually. 
to a very gentle boil. Keep this up until the feet begin 
to shrink from the bones — about two hours. Should the 
water fall perceptibly, fill up from the tea-kettle. Have 
ready the vegetables, herbs, and spice, the former cut up 
small. Put them into the liquor left from yesterday's 
head, and when you have heated this to a boil, add the 
feet with the water in which they are cooking. Boil for 
another hour, still slowly. Strain the soup, cool to make 
the grease rise. Skim, season, and return to the fire. 
When again boiling, stir in the milk, and the meat from 
the feet, cut into dice. Take out a cupful of the soup 
and pour, by degrees, over the beaten eggs. Return to 
the pot, stir two minutes, and serve. 

A very nice soup, and a-nutritious. If you cannot get 
calf s feet, use those of a pig instead, cooking exactly in 
the same way. 

Salt Mackerel, with Cream Sauce. 

Soak overnight in lukewarm water, changing this in 
the morning for ice-cold. Rub all the salt oflf, and wipe 
dry. Grease your gridiron with butter, and rub the fish 
on both sides with the same, melted. Then broil quickly 
over a clear fire, turning with a cake-turner so as not to 
break it. Lay upon a hot-water dish, and cover until the 
the sauce is ready. 

Heat a small cup of milk to scalding. Stir into it a 
teaspoonful of corn-starch, wet up with a little water. 
When this thickens, add two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
pepper, salt, and chopped parsley. Beat an egg hght, 
pour the sauce gradually over it, put the mixture again 
over the fire, and stir one minute, not more. Pour upon 
the fish, and let all stand, covered, over the hot water 
in the chafing-dish. Put fresh boiling water under the 
dish before sending to table. 



112 FEBRUARY. 

Mashed Potatoes, 

Beaten light with milk and butter, and smoothed into a 
mound, should be served with the fish. If you have a 
pretty butter-print, wet ft, and stamp the top of the 
mound. 

Remember that everything tastes better for looking 



Larded Sweetbreads, Stewed. 

3 or 4 fine sweetbreads. 

\ lb. fat salt pork, cut into " lardoons," or long narrow 

strips. i 

I cup of gravy (saved from the roast calf s head of 

yesterday). 

1 tablespoonful of tomato or other catsup. 
Juice of half a lemon. 

Season with pepper. 

Parboil the sweetbreads for five minutes. The water 
should boil when they are dropped in. Take out and lay 
at once in ice-cold water. This makes them firm. 
Leave in this five minutes, wipe dr)', and set aside to get 
cold. Then lard with the strips of pork, passing them 
quite through, so as to project on both sides. If you 
have no larding-needle, use a long-bladed penknife. Put 
them into a saucepan ; cover with the gravy. If there 
is not enough, put in a few spoonfuls from the boiling 
soup. The gravy should be cold, however, when poured 
over the sweetbreads. Stew about twenty-five minutes 
after the boil begins. Take out the sweetbreads ; thicken 
the gravy with browned flour, add catsup, lemon, and pep- 
per, the lardoons having salted it sufficiently. Lay the 
sweetbreads upon a hot dish, pour the gravy ovel: them, 
and serve ; in carving, cut perpendicularly. 

Stewed Celery. 

2 bunches of celery, the white stalks only, scraped and 

cut into short pieces. 
2 beaten eggs. 
I cup of milk. 



FIRST WEEK— FRIDAY. I13 

I tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour. 
Pepper, salt, and a pinch of nutmeg. 

Stew the celery in a little salted hot water until quite 
tender. Drain off the water and put in the milk, cold. 
So soon as it boils, stir in the butter, rolled in flour, pep- 
per, salt, and nutmeg. Add a few spoonfuls of the hot' 
milk to the beaten eggs that they may not curdle in the 
saucepan ; put with the celery and sauce over the fire ; 
boil up once, and dish. 

Omelette Souffle. 

8 eggs. 

5 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 
I tablespoonful of butter. 
Vanilla or rose-water flavoring. 

Whip the whites to a very stiff froth, thick enough to be 
cut with a knife. Beat the yolks smooth and long ; add to 
these the sugar, whip up well, and flavor. Grease a neat 
pudding-dish abundantly with the tablespoonful of butter. 
The last thing before you take yo»r seat at the table, do 
all this ; stir whites and yolks together, and put into a 
steady, not too hot, oven. If you have a teachable cook, 
let her learn how to put the prepared ingredients together 
after dinner has gone in. The oven-door should be 
opened as seldom as possible, certainly not under fifteen 
minutes. By this time the omelette should have risen 
high, and be of a golden brown. Partly close the oven- 
door, to keep it hot, and let it be served as soon as possi- 
ble in the bake-dish. 

Never attempt this or any other nerve-trying dish, for the 
first time, for others than a family party. Yet it is easy 
enough when you have once learned for yourself how long 
to cook it, and how soon it will fall. 

Tea and Toasted Crackers, 

Split Boston crackers, toast, butter ; put where they will 
keep hot, and pass with an after-dinner cup of tea.

Gravy and Sago Soup. 
Boiled Corned Beef. Baked Macaroni. 

Cauliflower, with Sauce. Mashed Turnips,

Gravy and Sago Soup. 

4 lbs. coarse beef, cut into strips. 

3 lbs. of bones. 

I slice of lean corned ham. 

4 onions. 

4 cloves. 

1 bunch of sweet herbs. 
\ lb. of German sago. 
Pepper and salt. 

5 quarts of water. 

2 stalks of celery, cut small. 

Cut the beef into narrow strips, the onions into slices. 
Fry the latter brown in dripping, strain them out, and set 
aside. Return the dripping to the pan, and fry the meat 
until it is nicely browned, but not crisp. Lastly, fry the 
bones in the same fat. They should be broken up small. 
Put meat, bones, celery, spice, and onions into a pot with 
a quart of cold water ; cover closely, and put where it will 
not boil under an hour, but will heat all the time. This 
is to draw out color and open the pores (so to speak) of 
the meat. So soon as it boils add four quarts more of 
cold water. Set where it will boil steadily, but never fast, 
for five hours. Strain, and cool sufficiently to make the 
fat rise. Take it off, put back over the fire, season, boil 
up and skim ; put in the sago, which should have been 
soaked two hours in a little water, simmer fifteen minutes 
and serve. 

Save all that is left from dinner, for Monday. 



first week— saturday. 115 

Boiled Corned Beef. 

Wash well, and put over the fire in hot water — plenty 
of it — and boil twenty minutes for each pound of meat. 
Turn three times while cooking. Drain dry, and serve 
with drawn butter in a boat. " Draw " the butter in liq- 
uor taken from the pot. Keep the rest of the liquor for 
the base of Sunday's soup. 

Mashed Turnips. 

Pare, quarter, and lay in cold water half an hour. Put 
on in boiling water, and cook until tender. Drain, mash, 
and press to get out the water, work in pepper, salt, and 
a generous lump of butter. Do all this quickly not to 
cool the turnips, and pile smoothly in a hot, deep dish. 

Cauliflower, with Sauce. - 

Pick off the leaves and cut the stem close. Do not cut 
the cauliflower unless very large. Lay in cold water for 
thirty minutes, tie in coarse bobbinet lace or mosquito 
net, and cook in boiling water, slightly salted, until tender. 
Lay the cauliflower, flower upward, within a hot dish, and 
pour the sauce over it. 

Sauce for the above. 

Stir into a cup of boiling water a tablespoonful of flour, 
wet up with cold. When it has boiled two minutes, add 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, the white of an egg whipped 
stiff, pepper and salt, and the juice of a lemon. Boil one 
minute, and pour over the cauhflower. 

Baked Macaroni. 

Break half a pound of macaroni into pieces an inch 
long, and cook in boiling water, slightly salted, twenty 
minutes. Drain, and put a layer in the bottom of a greased 
bake-dish, upon this some grated cheese — Parmesan, if you 
can get it — and tiny bits of butter. Then more macaroni, 
and so on, filling the dish, with grated cheese on top. 



Il6 FEBRUARY. 

Wet with a little milk, and salt lightly. Bake, covered 
half an hour, then brown. Serve in the bake-dish. 

Jelly Tartlets. 

I lb. of flour. 

\ lb. of butter. 
I lb. of lard. 
Yolk of an egg. 
Ice-water. 

Wash the butter in three waters, working it over well 
to get out the salt. Melt it in a tin cup set in boiling 
water, take the scum from the top, and let it get almost 
cold, when beat, little by little, into the whipped egg. 
Work these into the flour, adding just enough ice-water to 
make the paste soft enough to roll out. When you have 
rolled it into a thin sheet, spread all over with the lard, 
put on with a knife. Sprinkle lightly with flour, roll up, 
and flatten with three or four strokes of the rolling-pin. 
Roll again into a yet thinner sheet ; again lubricate with 
the lard and sprinkle with flour, and, once more, make 
into a tight roll. Set for an hour in a cold place. Cut in 
two. Set aside enough for yonr Monday's dessert ; line 
small "patty-pans" with the rest, pricking the paste on 
the bottom to keep it from pufiing too high. Bake in a 
quick oven, and when" cold put a tablespoonful of sweet 
jelly or jam in each. 

Apples and Nuts, 

Especially the former, are better for very young stomachs 
than pastr}'.

tom. At the end of this time add the beef liquor (after 
staking off the fat), the onions, and celery. Cook gently 
three hours, until the beans are boiled to pieces. Strain, 
season, put back into the kettle, boil up, season with pep- 
per, stir in the butter rolled in flour. Simmer five min- 
utes, and pour upon the fried bread in the tureen. 

If you cannot get the purple " mock turtle soup beans," 
use the common white ones. 

Haunch of Venison. 

Wash all over with lukewarm vinegar and water ; then 
rub well with butter or lard to soften the skin. Cover 
the top and sides with foolscap paper, wfell greased, and 
coat it with a paste of flour and water, half an inch thick. 
Lay over this a large sheet of thin wrapping-paper, and

Thus much on Saturday — and set the venison in a very 
cold place. Next day, about three hours before it will be 
needed, put into the dripping-pan, with two cups of boil- 
ing water in the bottom. Invert another pan over it to 
keep in the steam ; be sure that the fire is good, and leave 
it to itself for an hour. Then see that the paper is not 
scorching ; wet it all over with hot water and a ladleful 
of gravy ; cover and let it alone for an hour and a half 
more. Remove the papers and paste, and test with a 
skewer in the thickest part. If it goes in readily, close 
the oven, and let it brown for half an hour. Baste freely 
four times with claret and butter ; at last dredge with 
flour and rub over with butter to make a fi'oth. Take it 
upj, put upon a, hot dish. Skim the gravy lift in the 
dripping pan, strain it, thicken with browned flour ; add 
two teaspoonfuls of currant-jelly, a glass of claret, pepper 
and salt. Boil up for an instant, and serve in a gravy- 
boat. Allow a qua'rter of an hour to the pound in roast- 
ing venison. The neck can be roasted in the same wa^„ 
as the haunch. 

Mashed Potatoes — Moulded. 

Having mashed and seasoned them as usual, greasei 
well the inside of a fluted pudding or cake mould, put iij 
the potato, cover, and set for half an hour in a dripping- 
pan half full of boiling water, within a moderate oven. 
Then remove the lid, dip, for a moment, the mould in 
cold water, and turn the potato out upon a flat dish, 

Lima Beans. 

You can get them canned, but they are nearly, if not 
quite as good dried." In this case soak them overnight, 
in soft water. Change this in the morning for fresh, and 
put them on to boil in hot water, a little salted. Cook 
slowly until soft. Do not boil so fast as to break the 
skins. Drain well, stir in a good piece of butter, a little 
pepper and salt, and eat very hot. 



SECOND WEEK— SUNDAY. UQ 

Sweet Potatoes — Browned. 
Boil in their skins, pgel while hot, and set thera in a 
quick oven. Glaze presently with butter, repeating the 
process, several times, as they brown. 

Wine Jelly with Whipped Cream. 

1 package of Coxe's gelatine, soaked for two hours in a 

large cup of cold water. 

2 cups of white wine, or pale sherry. 

I lemon, all the juice and half the grated peel. 

1 teaspoonful of bitter almond extract. 

2 cups of white sugar. 

2 cups of boiling water. 

Put soaked gelatine, lemon, sugar, and flavoring extract 
together, and cover closely for half an hour. Pour on 
boiling water, stir and strain. Add the wine, strain again 
through a flannel bag, without squeezing, and leave in a 
mould wet with cold water, until just before the Sunday 
dinner. 

Whip a cup of rich cream to a thick froth in a syllabub- 
churn. The jelly should have been formed in .an open 
mould — one with cylinder in the middle. Fill the hollow 
left by this with the whipped cream ; or, if your jelly be 
a solid mass, heap the cream about the base. 

Coffee and Macaroons 

Should be the final course. I make no apology for 
hot and good Sunday dinners. There is a vast deal of 
straining out infinitesimal gnats and swallowing gigantic 
camels upon this, as upon most other questions of con- 
science. We have neither time nor space for their dis- 
cussion. 1 have simply tried to deal with the fact that 
most husbands, brothers, and fathers expect a better din- 
ner on Sabbath, and enjoy it more, than upon other days, 
by showing, to the best of my ability, how they can be 
gratified without imposing heavy duties upon mistress and 
servants at a season when both mind and body need com- 
parative rest.

" Second Thoughts " Soup. 
Larded Venison. Scalloped Tomatoes. 

Grape Jelly. Fried Sweet Potatoes. 



Raspberry and Currant Jelly Tart. 



"SEC0^fD Thoughts" Soup. 

Heat Saturday's soup to a boil ; add two cups of 
milk, and when this heats, pour a little of it upon two 
beaten eggs. Return these to the soup, add whatever 
seasoning is necessary ; simmer all together for one min- 
ute, and pour upon three or four tablespoonfuls of grated 
cheese placed in the bottom of the tureen. Stir up well, 
and it is ready. 

Larded Venison. 

Trim the remains of the roast haunch into a neat shape, 
and lard with strips of fat pork, making incisions to re- 
ceive it with a thin, sharp-edged knife. Pour what gravy 
you have over it, or should there be none, use butter 
and water instead. Put into a dripping-pan, turn another 
over it and roast — or steam — for one hour. Meantime,, 
make a gravy of the trimmings, bits of bone, etc., by 
covering them well with cold water, and adding half an 
onion, sliced. Stew until the gravy is reduced one-half. 
Strain, season with pepper ; a tablespoonful of currant- 
jelly, one of catsup and two of claret. Thicken slightly 
with browned flour, boil up to mix well, and pour gradu- 
ally over the meat. Baste abundantly with this for half 
an hour if the piece of meat be large. Less time may 
suffice for a small roast. Never let it dry for an instant. 
When done, it should seem to have been stewed rather 
than roasted. Serve the gravy in a sauce-boat. 

Like some other " second thoughts," this dish will be 
even better than at its first appearance. 



SECOND WEEK— MONDAY. 121 

Scalloped Tomatoes. 

Turn nearly all the juice off from a can of tomatoes. 
Salt and pepper this, by the way, and put aside in a cool 
place for some other day's soup. Put a layer of bread- 
crumbs in the bottom of a buttered pie-dish ; on them 
one of tomatoes ; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and some 
bits of butter, also a little sugar. Another layer of 
crumbs, another of tomatoes — seasoned — then a top 
layer of very fine, dry crumbs. Bake covered until bub- 
bling hot, and brown quickly. 

Fried Sweet Potatoes. 
Slice cold ones left from yesterday, or boiled this fore- 
noon ; roll in flour and fry in dripping. Drain well. 

Raspberry and Currant Jelly Tart. 

Roll out the raw paste reserved for to-day from Satur- 
day, and line two pie-dishes. Fill them nearly full of 
canned raspberries, sweetened to your liking. Spread a 
coating of currant jelly over the top, and cover with a 
lattice-work of pastry, cut with a jagging-iron. Watch 
your chance of putting them into the oven, as they are 
better when not hot. 

You will like them, I think. 



Clam Soup. 

Ragout of Veal. Rice and Cheese. 

Potato Puff. Celery Salad. 



A Mere Trifltf. 



Clam Soup. 
50 clams, ready opened.

fire in a large farina-kettle, with a pint of water, the 
peppers, mace, celery, and salt. When it has boiled ten 
minutes, strain atjd put back into the kettle with the 
clams. Shut the lid down closely, and boil, fast, thirty 
minutes. Heat the milk in another vessel, stir into jt 
the rice-flour, wet up with cold water, and the butter. 
Pour into the kettle with the clams, take at once from the 
.fire, pour into the tureen, in the bottom of which you have 
laid four or five Boston crackers^ split. Cover, and wait 
five minutes before serving. 

Ragout of Veal. 

S lbs. of knuckle of veal. 

1 onion. 

2 Stalks of celery. 
Bunch of sweet herbs.

and put them into a saucepan with the minced onion, 
celery, and herbs, with a quart of waten Stew slowly 
until the liquor has boiled down to a pint. Meanwhile, 
cut the veal into neat slices, and fry until they begin to 
brown, in some good dripping. Strain the gravy made 
from the bones and vegetables over this, and put all on 
to stew, adding the tom^tp-juice, pepper, ^nd pork, the 
last cut up fine. Simmer, with the lid on, for jiwo hours. 



SECOND WEEK— TUESDAY. 123 

Then add the browned flour, wet up in cold water, salt, 
if needed, the butter and lemon-juice. Boil up once, and 
dish. 

Rice and Cheese. 

Boil a cup of rice in a quart of water, slightly salted, 
aiid wrhen half-done add two tablespoonfuls of butter. 
By the time the rice is soft, the water should have been 
soaked up entirely, and each grain stand out whole in the 
mass. Never stir boiling rice, but shake up the saucepan 
instead. Stir into the rice, at this point, three tablespoon- 
fuls of grated cheese, salt and pepper to taste. Toss up 
with a fork until the cheese is dissolved, and pour into a 
deep dish. 

Potato Puff. 

Mash the potatoes while hot. Beat in butter, milk, 
and two whipped eggs, with salt to your liking, until you 
have a light, soft paste. Bake in a buttered pudding- dish 
in a quick oven. 

CpLERY Salad. 

Cut up |)l^nc}ipd stalks pf celery into short pieces. 
Mix a dressing of one tablespoonful of oil to one tea- 
spoonful of sugar, one of salt, half as much pepper, and 
four tablespoonfuls of vinegar with half a teaspoonful of 
made mustard. Heat the vinegar to scalding, and pour 
over a beaten egg, a little at a time, and beating it • in 
well. To this add the oil and other ingredients, whipping 
up the mixture with an egg-beater. When cold, pour 
over the salad, toss up with a silver fork, and put into a 
glass bowl. 

A Mere Trifle. 

I quart of fresh milk. 

5 eggs. 

6 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Vanilla, or other essence, 2 teaspoonfuls. 

Heat the milk to boiling, and pour, gradually, upon the 
beaten yolks and sugar. Put again oyer the fire, stir 



124 FEBRUARY. 

steadily for about ten minutes, or until it begins to 
thicken. Take it off, and while still very hot, stir in with 
a few light strokes half of the frothed whites. Let it get 
cold before flavoring it. Pour into a glass bowl. Whip 
the remaining whites to a meringue with a little powdered 
sugar. Heap upon the custard. Put bits of bright 
jelly, or preserved strawberries, here and there upon the 
snowy mass. 



Hotch-Potch. 

Stewed Pigeons. Potatoes a la L.yonnaise. 

Kidney Beans. Mixed Pickles. 



English Tapioca Pudding. 



HoTCH-PoTCH. 

2 lbs. of lean beef, without bones, and cut into mince- 
meat. 
2 onions. 
2 carrots. 
2 turnips. 
2 stalks of celery. 
\ small cabbage, cut fine. 
2 potatoes. 

1 cup of corn. 

Half a can of tomatoes. 
Bunch of sweet herbs, chopped. 
Pepper and salt. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

Wash, scrape, and slice the vegetables, and put all ex- 
cept the tomatoes into a pot ; cover with hot water and 
boil gently ten minutes. Drain off the water, put a hand- 
ful of the mixed vegetables, including now the tomatoes, 
in the bottom of a stone jar. Pepper and salt, strew 



SECOND WEEK— THURSDAY. 125 

thickly with the minced raw beef, repeat the order until 
your materials are all in the jar. Fit a top or a small 
plate over the mouth ; tie down with stout greased paper, 
set it within the oven, and let it alone for five or six hours, 
except that you must look, now and then, to see that the 
paper does not take fire. Prevent this by greasing it 
abundantly. At the end of this time, turn out the hotch- 
potch ; stir in the butter, and, if needed, additional season- 
ing through it, and serve in a tureen. 

Stewed Pigeons. 

Pick, clean, and wash the pigeons, and put into a pot 
with a cupful of water to keep them from burning, and a 
tablespoonful of butter for each one. Shut the lid down 
tightly, and subject to a slow heat until they are of a nice 
brown — about nut-color. Once in a great while turn 
them, and see that each is well wet with the liquor. Take 
them out and cover in a warm place — a colander set over 
a pot of hot water is best — while you make the gravy. 
Chop the giblets of the pigeon " exceeding small " with 
a little onion and parsley. Put into the gravy, pepper 
and salt, boil up and thicken with browned flour. Return 
the pigeons to the pot, cover again tightly, and cook 
slowly until tender. If there should not be liquor enough 
in the pot to make the gravy, add boiling water before the 
giblets go in. 

This is an admirable receipt. 

Potatoes 1. la Lyonnaise. 

Cut parboiled potatoes into dice. Chop an onion and 
fry it, with a little minced parsley, in good dripping or 
butter, for one minute. Then put in the potatoes. 
Stir briskly until they have fried slowly for five minutes. 
They must never stick to the bottom, nor brown. Sprinkle 
with pepper and salt, drain free of fat by shaking them in 
a heated colander, and send up hot. 

Kidney Beans. 

Soak over night in soft water ; next morning cover with 
lukewarm, and cook slowly for one hour. Salt slightly 



126 FEBRUARY. 

and boil until tender, but not to actual breaking. Drain 
very well, stir in a liberal spoonful of butter, pepper, and 
serve. 

English Tapioca Pudding. 

1 cup of tapioca. 

5 eggs. 

3 pints of milk. 

1 cup of sugar. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 
■J lb. of raisins. 

Half the grated peel of a lemon. 
A little salt. 

Soak the tapioca for one hour in a pint of the milk ; 
pour into a farina-kettle, surround with warm water, salt 
very slightly, and bring to a boil. When soft throughout, 
turn out to cool, while you make the custard. Heat a 
quart of milk to scalding ; pour over the. beaten eggs and 
sugar, this last having been rubbed to a cream with the 
butter. Mix with the tapioca — lemon-peel and raisins last. 
Dredge the fruit lightly with flour, and beat all up hard. 
Bake in a buttered dish one hour — at first covered. 

Eat warm, with powdered sugar. It is better for not 
being too hot. 



Celery Soup. 

Mutton Cutlets — Fried. Stewed Corn and Tomatoes. 

Brussels Sprouts. Mashed Potatoes. 



Apple Meringue Pie. 



Celery Soup. 
2 lbs. of veal.

2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet up in water. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 
I teaspoonful of sugar. 

I onion. 

Dice of fried bread. 

Pepper and salt. 

3 quarts of water. 

Chop the meat, onion, and herbs ; cover with the water 
^and put on to stew early in the day. When the meat 
has boiled to rags and the liquid reduced one-half, strain, 
and put in the celery, cut into small pieces. Use the 
best parts only. Stew soft ; rub through a colander and 
return with the broth to the saucepan. Season, add the 
sugar, boil up and skim, and put in the milk. Heat, and 
add corn starch. When it again boils, you stirring all the 
while, put in the butter. 

Take off so soon as this has melted, and pour over the 
fried bread in the tureen. 

MtJTTON Cutlets — FRrED. 

Beat them flat with the broad side of a hatchet ; season 
with pepper and salt, dip first in beaten egg, then in 
bread-crumbs, and fry in lard or dripping. Drain per- 
fectly free from the fat, and arrange them, standing on 
end and touching one another, around a mound of mashed 
potatoes. 

Mashed Potatoes. 
Prepare as usual, and shape with a knife into a smooth 
mound, with a hedge of cutlets about the base. 

Stewed Corn and Tomatoes. 

Take a half-can of tomatoes and the same of corn, 
the rest of that which was opened for your " hotch-potch " 
yesterday, and, after mixing them up well, season with 
pepper, salt, and a little sugar. Set on where they will 
cook slowly. At the end of twenty-five minutes, stir in a 
great spoonful of butter. Put on the lid and stew very 
gently ten minutes more. Serve in a deep dish. 



128 FEBRUARY. 

Brussels Sprouts. 
Pick over, trim, and lay in cold water for half an hour, 
cook quickly in boiling water, a little salt, for fifteen min- 
utes. Drain carefully, put upon a flat dish, and pour drawn 
butter over them. 

Apple Meringue Pik, 

I quart of flour. 
1^ lb. of butter. 
I lb. of lard. 
Ice-water. 

Chop the lard in flour, wet up with ice-water to a stiff 
paste. Roll thin, and baste with one-third of the butter, 
sprinkle lightly with flour, and roll up. Again roll out, 
even thinner than before, baste again with half the re- 
maining butter, sprinkle with flour, and make a second 
roll. * Repeat this process yet a third time, and set in a 
cold place for one hour. 

Cut the roll of paste into two pieces, reserving one for 
to-morrow's oyster-pie. With the other, line two pie- 
dishes and fill with good apple-sauce, well sweetened, 
and seasoned with nutmeg. Bake until just done. Draw 
to the oven door, and spread with a meringue made by 
whipping stiff the whites of three eggs for each pie, sweet- 
ening with a tablespoonful of sugar for each egg. Flavor 
with a little rose-water or lemon-essence, beat until you 
can make a clean cut in it, and spread three-quarters of 
an inch thick upon each pie. Shut the oven door until 
the m&ingue is well set. Do not let it scorch. Eat 
cold.

2 turnips. 

4 tablespoonfuls of butter. 
\ cup raw rice. 

2 eggs. 

Pepper and salt to taste. 
I tablespoonful of chopped parsley. 
' 3 quarts of water. 

Boil the vegetables, all chopped fine (reserving the 
parsley for seasoning), in three quarts of water until they 
can be pulped through a colander. Return them, with 
the water in which they were cooked, to the fire. Boil 
the rice, meantime, in a little water until it swells and 
absorbs it all. Stir into the vegetable porridge, season, 
and simmer for fifteen minutes. Add the butter, sim- 
mer ten minutes, dip out a cupful and beaf into the 
eggs. Stir this into the broth, and before it begins 
to boil, take from the fire and pour out, lest the eggs 
should curdle. 

Oyster Pie. 

Roll out the raw paste made yesterday into a pretty 

thick sheet. Fill a pudding-dish with crusts of stale bread, 

or light crackers. Butter the edges of the dish that the 

crust may be easily removed. Cover the mockpie with

the pastry; lay a strip cut in scallops or points, around the 
edge, to keep it in place, and bake. 

To each pint of oyster-liquor allow a cup of milk, but 
heat them in separate vessels. So soon as the liquor 
boils, put in the oysters and cook five minutes more. 
Stir a tablespoonful of corn-starch into the pint of hot 
milk, having, of course, first wet it up with cold water, 
and, when it thickens, pour over the oysters and liquor. 
Season with pepper and salt, and add two tablespoonfuls 
of butter, if there be a quart of oysters. Lift the hot 
crust from the pudding-dish with great care. Remove the 
stale bread, wipe out the inside ; pour in the stewed 
oysters with enough of the soup to cover them well ; re- 
place the pastry and set in the oven for two or three min- 
utes. 

Calf's Liver a l'Anglaise. 

2 lbs. of fresh liver. 

\ lb. fat salt pork. 

I tablespoonful of butter. 

^ of a small onion. 

i teaspoonful of chopped parsley. 

Pepper. 

The pork should salt it sufficiently. 

Put the butter into a warm — not hot saucepan. Cut 
the liver into slices half an inch tliick, and lay upon the 
butter. Mince the pork and cover the liver. Sprinkle 
the parsley and onion, with pepper, on top. Cover the 
saucepan closely and set in a kettle of hot water. Keep 
this water below the boiling-point for an hour. Then let 
it boil another hour. The liver should by this time be 
very tender and juicy, if the heat has been properly man- 
aged. Take it out, and put it upon a ch&,fing-dish to keep 
warm. Boil up, and thicken the gravy with browned flour ; 
pour over the liver and serve. The inner saucepan should 
be made of tin. 

Potatoes au Gratin. 

Mash your potatoes soft with butter and milk ; mould 
in a round pan or tin jelly-mould, made very wet with 



SECOND WEEK— FRIDAY. 131 

cold water. Turn out upon a flat plate — a sheet of tin 
IS better-^ well-greased, strew with fine, dry bread-crumbs ; 
set upon the upper grating of the oven to brown quickly. 
Slip dexterously from the plate to a hot dish. 

Stewed Parsnips. 

Boil tender and cut in long slices. Heat in a sauce- 
pan a cup of milk, thicken it with a tablespoonful of 
butter cut into bits and rolled in flour, season with pep- 
per, salt, and a little nutmeg. Put in the parsnips, boil 
up once gently, take from the fire, and leave covered in 
the saucepan for five minutes before you serve. 

PiCKLETTE AND APPLE SauCE. 

Pass the first with the oyster pie, which is a course of 
itself; the apple sauce with the meat. 

Chocolate Custard. 

I quart of milk. 
5 eggs. 

1 cup of sugar. 

4 heaping tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate. 

2 teaspoonfuls vanilla extract. 

Scald the milk, rub the chocolate to a smooth paste in 
a little cold milk. Stir into the milk and cook two min- 
utes in it. Beat lip the yolks of the five «ggs with the 
whites of two, and the sugar. Pour the hot mixture, 
gradually, upon them, stirring deeply. Turn into a but- 
tered pudding-dish, and set in a dripping-pan of boiling 
water: Bake until firm. When " set " in the middle, 
spread quickly, without taking from the oven, with a mk- 
ringtte made by whipping the reserved whites stiff with a 
very little sugar. Bake until this is done. Eat cold.

\ lb. of macaroni cut into fancy shapes, usually known 

as "Italian Paste." 
6 cloves. 

3 tablespoonfuls of butter. 
6 quarts of water. 

3 stalks of celery. 

Mince the meat, crack the bones, and slice the vege- 
tables. Mix all together. Put the butter in the bottom 
of a soup-pot, next the meat, then the vegetables and 
herbs ; fit on a tight lid, and set the pot where it will 
warm very slowly. At the end of an hour, open it, pour 
off the gravy ; increase the heat until the meat begins to 
brown on the sides of the pot. Return the gravy to the 
rest of the ingredients ; cover with six quarts of cold 
water, and boil until the liquor has fallen to four quarts. 
This should be in four hours. Strain the soup ; press- 
ing out all the nourishment, and rubbing the vegetables 
through the sieve. Add the paste, or, if you cannot, 
obtain it, the same quantity of pipe macaroni, boiled a 
few minutes in hot water, and left to get cool. Then, 
with a sharp knife or scissors, clip it into very short bits, 
and put into the soup. Season, boil up, skim well, and 



SECOND WEEK—SATURDAY. ^33 

let all cook gently together for ten minutes. Half of tiie 
above quantity of stock will be enough for Saturday's 
dinner. Therefore, before adding the macaroni, take out 
about two quarts, season well, and set aside for Sunday's 
soup. 

Baked Ham. 

Soak overnight in warm water. In the morning, scrub 
it hard ; trim away the rusty part of the under side and 
edges ; wipe dry ; cover the bottom with a stiff paste of 
flour and water, and lay, upside down, in the dripping- 
pan, -with enough water to keep it from burning. Allow, 
in baking, twenty-five minutes to the pound. Baste a 
few times, to prevent the skin from cracking, and keep 
hot water in the pan. When a skewer will pierce the 
thickest part, take it up, plunge for one minute into cold 
water ; skin carefully, brush all over with beaten egg, then 
strew very thickly with' cracker-crumbs, and set in a hot 
oven to brown. Eat hot or cold, garnished with sprigs 
of celery or parsley. 

Chkese Fondu. 

I pint of boiling milk. 

I cup very dry bread-crumbs. (Crush the crusts baked 

in yesterday's oyster pie.) 
■J- lb. dry cheese, grated. 

3 eggs- 
Pepper and salt. • % 

Soak the crumbs in the hot milk ; beat in .the cheese ; 
then the yolks of the eggs, pepper and salt.* Have a 
buttered pudding-dish ready, and just before the fondu 
goes into the oven whip in the whites of the eggs, already 
frothed. Pour into the dish, bake in a brisk oven, and 
send at once to table, as it soon falls. This is a delightful 
accompaniment to ham. 

Spinach with Eggs. 

Pick the leaves from the stems, wash well, and boil in 
hot water, a little salted, for twenty minutes. Chop and 
drain. Return to the saucepan with a tablespoonful of

butter, a teaspoonful of sugar, a little pepper and salt. 
Have ready the yolks of three eggs, rubbed to powder, 
then wet up with a little cream or milk. Stir all together 
in the saucepan, beating with a wire spoon, until they are 
smooth and thick. Turn into a deep dish and garnish 
with the whites of the eggs cut into rings. 

Stewed Potatoes. 
Pare the potatoes ; cut into quarters, and these into 
long, even strips. Lay in cold water half an hour, and 
cook in boiling water until tender, with half a minced 
onion. Drain off nearly all the water ; pepper and salt, 
and add a cup of cold milk with a tablespoonful of butter 
rolled in flour. When it thickens, stir in a little chopped 
parsley. Simmer five minutes and serve. The potatoes 
should not be allowed to break so much as to lose their 
shape.

Prepare the turkey as for roasting, and, if you have no 
steamer, put a gridiron upon the top of a pot of boiling 
water ; lay the fowl upon it, invert a deep pin, as nearly 
as possible the size of the mouth of the pot, over it, stuff 
wet cloths into whatever space may be left between the 
pot and the pan, and keep the water at a hard boil, 
allowing twenty minutes for each pound of turkey. Two 
or three times, replenish the water by pulling away one 
of the cloths so as to leave an aperture large enough to 
admit the nose of the boiling tea-kettle. When the tur- 
key is half done, lift the pan and turn it ; replace the 
cloths and steam again. When it is done, lay upon a hot 
dish and baste with a mixture of melted butter and 
chopped parsley, anointing all parts of it well. Serve 
drawn butter in a boat, with a couple of boiled eggs 
chopped fine, stirred up in it. Save the giblets of the 
turkey for Monday's soup. 

Cranbekry Sauce 
In a mould, as strained jelly, or the plainer dish pf stewed 
cranberries, well-sweetened, must accompany this dish. 



136 FEBRUARY. 

Naples Rice Pudding. 

Take a few tablespoonfiils of the meat boiled iti yes- 
terday's soup, mince fine, add half a chopped onion, 
a tablespoonful of dripping from the top of the soiij), 
and put on to warm with a very little hot water. Sim- 
mer, but do not boil, fifteen minutes. Boil one cup 
of rice in enough water, slightly salt, to cover it well. 
Shake up from time to time, but do not stir. When 
the rice is soft and has soaked up the water, add a cup of 
cold milk in which has been stirred a tablespoonful of 
corn-starch, one raw egg, and a tablespoonful of butter. 
Take from the fire before you do this and turn into a 
bowl. Stir in now the minced meat and gravy (there 
should be very little of the latter), season to taste, mix all 
up well, and put into a buttered cake-mould. Set this in a 
dripping-pan of hot water and bake one hour, closely 
covered. Turn out upon a hot dish. It is a very good 
entrie, and easily made. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. 

Boil in their skins until soft to the touch ; pare quickly, 
lay upon a flat dish, butter each, and serve hot. 

Pumpkin Pie. 

1 quart of stewed pumpkin, rubbed through a fine 

colander.

2 quarts of milk. 

I teaspoonful of mace. 

I teaspoonful of cinnamon and the same of nutmeg. 

\\ cups of sugar. 

Beat the eggs hght and whip in the sugar, then the 
pumpkin and spice. At last, mix in tlie milk, stirring up 
well from the bottom.

ceipt given last Thursday. Eat cold, and send arouud a 
plate of cheese with it. 



THIRD WEEK— MONDAY. 1 37 

Giblet Soup. 

Turkey and Ham. Corn Puddings. 

Peach Pickles. Baked Potatoes. 



Farina Custard. 



Giblet Soup. 
Cut the giblets of your turkey into six pieces each, 
and stew, closely covered, in a pint of water until tender. 
Strain out the barley from the remains of yesterday's soup 
and if you have any of Saturday's in the pantry, strain out 
the vermicelli and add that. Warm this to a boil with 
the liquor in which the giblets were cooked. Boil up 
sharply and skim ; add the giblets, and while they simmer 
together, put two tablespoonfuls of butter cut into bits, 
and rolled in browned flour, into a frying-pan. Stir until 
it is hissing hot. Add to the soup with a handful of 
chopped parsley, and a tablespoonful of walnut or mush- 
room catsup. Boil up once and serve. 

Turkey and Ham. 
Cover the uncarved side of your steamed turkey with 
rather thick and fat slices of cooked ham. Three or four 
large ones will suffice. Bind them to the body with 
greased packthread. Lay the turkey, cut side downward, 
and the ham up, in the dripping-pan with a little boiling 
water in the bottom. Bake about three-quarters of an 
hour, basting the ham, when it begins to drip, with its own 
grease. Ten mfcutes before taking it up, clip the strings, 
and remove the ham to a hot dish. Dredge the upper 
side ef the turkey with flour, and baste with butter to 
make a brown froth. Dish, with the ham laid around it. 

Corn Puddings. 
Add "to a can of sweet corn, 
I cup of milk. 
3 ^-ggs. 



138 FEBRUARY. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

1 of sugar. 

2 tablespoonfuls of flour. 
I teaspoonful of salt. 

Beat up the eggs, add the sugar and butter^ the milk, 
corn, and, lastly, the flour. Bake in earthenVvare cups 
well buttered, or in neat patty-pans. Turn out upon a 
dish, or eat from the cups. They are very nice when hot. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Wash, wipe, and bake in a moderate oven. When 
done, cut a round piece of skin almost entirely from the 
top of each, leaving a " hinge " at one side. With a 
small knife make an incision in the mealy part of the 
potato, i. e., the heart, put in a pinch of salt, and a bit of 
butter, replace the flap of skin, and send hot to table. 

Farina Custard. 
I quart of milk. 
4 tablespoonfuls of farina. 

3 eggs well beaten. 
I cup of sugar. 

Vanilla essence — 2 teaspoonfuls. 
I saltspoonful of salt. 

Heat the milk to scalding ; stir in the farina, which 
should have been previously soaked in a little cold water 
for an hour. Cook in a farina-kettle fifteen minutes, stir- 
ring often. Take out a cupful and beat into the eggs 
already whipped up with the sugar. Put into the kettle, 
stir in salt and flavoring, boil two minutes, and pour into 
a deep dish. Eat warm, putting a teas'poonful of sweet 
fruit jelly upon the top of each saucerfiil in serving.

Plain Calf's Head Soup. 
Boiled Mutton. Minced Cabbage. 

StriHg-Beans. Beetroot Salad. 



Corn Meal Puffs. 



Plain Calf's Head Soup. 

Wash a cairs head (cleaned with the skin on), in three 
waters, and soak one hour in salted water. Then put on 
to boil in five quarts of cold water. Cook until the 
meat slips easily from the bones. Take out the head, 
remove the bones, and throw back into the soup. Set 
aside three-quarters of the meat — the best portions — for 
to-morrow's dinner. Chop the ears and other refuse parts 
fine ; season with salt, pepper, onion, sweet marjoram, a 
teaspoonful of ground cloves, and as much allspice — even 
spoonfuls. Mix all up well, return to the soup and boil 
down to three quarts. Mash the brains and make into 
forcemeat balls with raw egg, seasoning and enough flour 
to hold them together ; roll in flour and set in a cool 
place until wanted. Put two tablespoon fuls of butter into 
a saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of browned flour wet 
up with cold water, and stir together five minutes. Strain 
the soup, put back two quarts over the fire, stir in the 
thickening of flour and butter, boil up and put in the 
forcemeat balls. Simmer ten minutes, add the juice of a 
lemon, and a glass of brown sherry, and pour out. The 
reserved quart of " stock " is for another day's soup. Do 
not put the calf s tongue into the soup. It is indispen- 
sable in to-morrow's ragoflt. 

Boiled Mutton. 

The best jjart for boiling is the leg. Put on in boiling 
water and cook, allowing fifteen minutes to the pound. 
Make a sauce by taking out a cupful of liquor when it is 
nearly done, cooling it until you can take off' the fat, 
then heating again in a saucepan and stirring into it one 



I40 FEBRUARY. 

tablespoonful of butter, two teaspoonfuls of flour, wet up 
with cold water. Stir for five minutes, putting in a tea- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, and after another boil, take 
from the fire before you put in the juice of a lemon. 

In this, as in other cases where the liquor in which 
meat is boiled is to be used for broth, salt slightly while 
cooking, sprinkling all over lightly with salt the moment 
you take it from the fire. Serve the sauce in a boat. 

Minced Cabbage. 

Boil a firm head of cabbage, quartered, in two waters, 
tnrowing the first away after ten minutes' cooking and 
putting in more as hot, and a little salted. When it is 
tender all through, drain and chop quite fine, seasoning 
with salt, pepper, and a liberal portion of butter. Serve 
hot in a vegetable dish. 

String Beans. 

Open a can of string beans an hour before they are to 
be used. Cut them into short pieces when you are ready 
to cook them ; turn off the liquor and cover them with 
cold water. Put into a pot with a bit of salt pork a 
little more than an inch square. Boil slowly until tender, 
strain, season with pepper, and serve hot, with the pork on 
top of the pile of beans. 

Beetroot Salad. 

Boil the beets until tender ; scrape clean ; drop into 
cold water for three minutes. Slice, and pour over them 
a dressing of vinegar, salt, sugar, made mustard, pepper, 
and one tablespoonful of oil to four of vinegar. Cover, 
and let all stand together for two hours. This salad will 
keep for a couple of days. 

Corn-meal Puffs. 

1 quart of boiling milk. 

2 scant cups of white " corn-flour." 
\ cup of wheat-flour. 

I scant cup of powdered sugar. 
A little salt. 



THIRD WEEK— WEDNESDAY. 141 

4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately. 

I tablespoonful of iDutter. 

\ teaspoonful of soda. 

I teaspoonful of cream tartar. 

\ teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and nutmeg. 

Sift soda and cream tartar twice through the flour. 
Then, mix flour and meal together, and sift a third time. 
Boil the milk and stir into it the meal,, flour, and salt. 
Boil ten minutes, stirring well up from the bottom. Take 
it off, put into a bowl, add the butter and beat hard for 
three minutes. Let it cool while you whip the eggs light, 
then the yolks and sugar and spice together. Beat these 
into the cold mush, and lastly the frothed whites. Whip all 
together faithfully, and bake in greased cups or small 
" corn-bread moulds," set within a steady oven. When 
done, turn out and eat hot, breaking— not cutting — them 
open, and after buttering sprinkling with white sugar.

hour, salt, boil up and skiin. Take all the fat from the 
top of the cold soup-stock, and stir into the liquor already 
on the fire. Add the onion and parsley minced, and the 
mace ; season to taste, cover and stew gently for one hour. 
Take out the sweetbreads and lay them where they will 
cool quickly. Strain the soup, return to the fire ; put in 
a dozen mushrooms (you can buy the French champignons 
in cans) stew fifteen minutes ; cut the sweetbreads into

\ teaspoonful mixed mace and allspice. 
Juice of a lemon. 
Butter or dripping for frying. 

Cut three-quarters of the calf's head — the best parts — 
into neat slices, also the tongue. Chop the rest, season 
with- the onion, pepper and salt, cover with three cups of 
cold water, and stew gently down to one cup of gravy. 
Meanwhile fry the slices of meat in good dripping. Take 
them out with a wire spoon and put into the bottom of a 
tin vessel set within another of warm — not boiling — water. 
Cover and set over the fire. Drain, slice and fry the 
mushrooms in the fat left in the frying-pan. Drain and 
lay these upon the meat in the inner vessel. Time the 
cooking of the gravy so as to have it ready, spiced, and 
seasoned, to be strained, hot over the meat and mush- 
rooms. Put on a light lid and simmer fifteen minutes, 
never boiling once. Strain off the gravy into a sauce-

pour the hot gravy over all. 

Mashed Turnips. 
Boil soft, drain and mash, pressing the water out well, 
return to the saucepan, with a generous lump of butter ; 
pepper and salt ; stir constantly until the butter is dis- 
solved, and all smoking hot, and serve in a covered dish. 

Creamed Potatoes, 
In mashing them, add more milk than usual, whipping 
up hard with a silver fork. While still very hot, beat in 
the white of an egg, 'already frothed stiffly ; pile in a deep 
dish and set, uncpvered, within the oven, until a light 
crust begins to form on the t6p, but not long enough to 
injure the dish. Brush over with butter to glaze it, and 
serve. 

Tomato Soy 
Is an excellent " stock " pickle. For directions for mak- 
ing it, please refer to page 488, " General Receipts, 
No. I, of Common-Sense Series." 

Sponge-cake Pudding. 

1 stale sponge-cake. 

2 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
4 eggs, beaten light. 

2 cups of milk. 

I tablespoonful of corn-starch, wet up with cold milk. 

Juice of one lemon and half the grated peel. 

Slice the cake and lay some of it in the bottom of a 
buttered pudding-dish. Make a custard by scalding the 
milk, stirring into it the corn-starch, then pouring it, by 
degrees, upon the beaten eggs and sugar. Add the lem- 
on ; pour over the cake, put another layer of slices ; more 
custard, and so on, until the mould is full. Put a small, 
heavy plate on top, and let all stand until the custard is 
soaked up. Cover and bake, half an hour, or until done 
throughout. Turn out xx^ow a flat dish, sprinkle thickly 
with white sugar, and eat warm or cold.

Potage au Riz. 
English Pork Pie. Mock Stewed Oysters. 

Potato Balls. Mixed Pickles. 



Lemon Jelly and Light Cake. 



Potage au Riz, 

In plainer English, rice-broth, can be achieved for to- 
day, with little trouble, by the help of the liquor in which 
your mutton was boiled on Tuesday. Wash and soak 
a cup of rice in cold water. At the end of half an hour, 
add it, with the water in which it has soaked, to the 
mutton-broth, from which you must first take the fat. 
Boil very slowly two hours, and should the water sink be- 
low the original level more than an inch, replenish with 
boiling. In another saucepan heat a cup of milk, thick- 
ened with a tablespoonful of rice-flour. Season the mut- 
ton-broth with pepper and parsley — it will hardly need 
salt. (Boil up and skim, before the parsley goes in.) 
Pour the hot milk over two beaten eggs, stir in well ; add 
to the soup in the kettle, and take instantly from the fire. 

English Pork Pie. 

3 lbs. of lean fresh pork, cut into strips as long as your 

finger. 
6 large juicy apples. 
2 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Pepper, salt, and mace to taste. 

1 cup of sweet cider.- 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 



THIRD WEEK— THURSDAY. I4S 

Good pie-paste for an upper crust, made according to 
receipt given for Thursday of second week in this 
month. 

Put a layer of pork within a pudding-dish ; season with 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg, or mace. Next a layer of sliced 
apples, strewed with sugar and bits of butter. Go on in 
this order until you are ready for the crust, having tlie 
last layer of apples. Pour in the cider, cover with a thick 
crust of good pastry, ornamented around the edge ; make 
a slit in the middle, and bake in a moderate oven one hour 
and a half. Should the crust threaten to brown too fast, 
cover with paper. When nicely browned, brush over with 
butter and close the oven door for a moment ; then wash 
well with white of egg. Eat hot. You will find it very 
good, odd as the receipt may seem. 

Mock Stewed Oysters. 
Scrape and drop into cold water a bunch of salsify, or 
oyster-plant. Cut into short pieces and stew tender in 
boiling water, a little salted. Drain off nearly all the 
water, and pour into the saucepan a cup of cold milk. 
When again hot, add a heaping tablespoonful of butter 
and a handful of fine cracker-dust, with pepper and salt. 
Stir very slowly for five minutes, and pour out. It should 
be about as thick as oyster soup. 

Potato Balls. 

Mash potatoes with a little butter and salt, and let 
them get cold. Then work in a beaten egg. Make into 
balls about twice the size of a walnut, with floured hands, 
roll them well in flour, and fry yellow- brown in good drip- 
ping or lard. Drain in a colander, and pile upon a flat 
dish. 

Lemo^t Jelly and Light Cake. 

5 lemons — ^juice of all and grated peel of two. 

2 large cups of sugar. 

1 package of Coxe's gelatine, soaked in two cups of 

cold water.

1 46 FEBRUARY. 

Stir sugar, lemon-juice, peel, and soaked gelatine to- 
gether, and leave, covered, for an hour. Then pour over 
them the boiling water ; stir until the gelatine is dis- 
solved ; strain through a flannel bag, without pressing. 
Add the wine, and let all drip, untouched, through double 
flannel. Pour into a wet mould. In cold weather, or if 
set on ice, it will be ready for use in six hours. Pass a 
basket of light cake with it.

I can of lobster. 

I quart of milk. 

I quart of cold water. 

3 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

\ cup of pounded cracker, 

I teaspoonful of salt. 

A littld' cayenne pepper. 
Free the lobster from all bits of shell, and cut up small, 
tearing as little as may be. Put the water into a sauce- 
pan, with the salt and pepper. When boiling, stir in the 
lobster and stew half an hour. Heat the milk in another 
vessel, and, when scalding, stir in the cracker and set in 
hot water for ten minutes. The lobstef having cooked 
for thirty minutes, add the butter, and simmer five min- 
utes longer. Then pour in the milk ; mix all up well ; 
set for five minutes in hot water, and serve in a tureen. 
Pass sliced lemon with it. 
This bisque is delicious. 



THIRD WEEK—FRIDAY. 147 

Stewed Chicken. 
Prepare a fine young fowl as for roasting, with the ex- 
ception of the dressing, which should be left out. Early 
in the day (if you have no gravy already made) put on 
the feet and giblets to stew in two cups of cold water, 
with a little minced onion. When the giblets are very 
tender, and the liquid has boiled down to one cupful, 
strain it and set aside the giblets to cool. Chop a 
quarter of a pound of pork, put it in the bottom of a pot, 
lay the chicken upon it ; pour the gravy over it ; cover 
tightly and set where it will heat steadily, but not reach 
the boil under an hour. Increase the heat, not allowing 
the steam to escape, for an hour longer, but it should not 
stew fast at any time. By this time the fowl should be 
thoroughly done. Remove carefully to a hot dish ; sea- 
son the gravy, adding a little hot water if neeiiful, and 
strain out the pork. Add the giblets, chopped fine, stew 
fast for one minute, pour over the chicken, and it is 
ready for the table. 

Rice Croquettes. 
2 cups of cold boiled rice. 

1 tablespoonful of melted butter. 

2 eggs, well beaten.

rice. Salt, and stir up with the eggs to a smooth paste. 
Make infj) oval balls or rolls, with well-floured hands. 
Roll in flour, and fry, a few at a time, in sweet lard. 
Drain well and eat hot. 

Winter Squash. 
Pare, take out the seeds, cut into strips, and lay in 
cold water, one hour. Cook in boiling water, a little 
salt, until very soft. Drain off" every drop of water, and 
mash with a potato beetle, stirring in a large spoonful of 
butter, and seasoning with pepper and salt. Mound up 
in a vegetable dish and serve hot. 



148 FEBRUARY. 

Apple Snow. 

6 fine pippins (raw). 

2 cups of milk. 

4 eggs. 

I cup of powdered sugar. 
Make a custard by stirring into the hot milk half the 
sugar, the yolks of ail the eggs, and the white of one, 
and cooking, stirring constantly until it thickens. Let 
this cool while you whip the whites to a stiff meringue 
with the rest of the sugar. Peel the apples, and grate 
directly into the miringue, stirring in at once that the 
coating of egg may prevent them from changing color. 
Put the cold custard in the bottom of a glass dish, and 
heap the snow upon it. Eat soon after making it. 

Tea and Macaroons. 

Pass after dinner in the dining-room, or send into the 
parlor.

i cup of oatmeal. 



THIRD WEEK— SATURDAY. 149 

Pepper and salt. 

6 quarts of cold water. 
Chop the vegetables and herbs ; cut the meat fine, and 
break up the bones. Put the oatmeal to soak in a pint 
of water. Slice the potatoes, and parboil them in hot 
water for ten minutes. Add them then to the other 
vegetables, and put them all, with the meat and bones, 
into a soup-pot, with the water. Stew for four hours, 
until the liquor in the pot has fallen one-third. Strain 
through a colander, set aside two quarts of the stock 
until to-morrow, after seasoning it all, and return the rest 
to the fire- Boil up and skim ; add the oatmeal, and 
stew, covered, forty minutes, stirring often, lest it should" 
burn. 

Mutton Chops and Tomato PuRfiE. 

Broil the chops, after truniniug them neatly ; rub, as 
soon as they leave the gridiron, with butter on both sides; 
pepper and salt, and cover, for a few minutes, in a hot 
water dish, that they may take up the seasoning. 

Make the pur'ee by stewing a can of tomatoes until 
almost dry, then seasoning, and stirring in a tablespoon- 
ful of butter rolled in flour. Simmer three minutes, ar- 
range the chops on their sides, overlapping each other, 
inside of the curve of a flat dish, and pour the puree 
within their enclosure. 

Potato Strips. 

Pare and cut the potatoes in long strips, the length of 
the potato, and not more than the sixteenth of an inch 
thick. Lay in ice-water for one hour ; dry by laying on 
one clean towel and pressing another upon it, and fry, not 
too many at once, in hot lard, a little salt. Take out so 
soon as they are browned lightly, toss in qi hot colander, 
and serve in a deep dish Ijned with a napkin. 

Boiled Beans. 

Soak all night, and in the morning change the cold water 
for lukewarm. Leave in this two hours ; drain it off and 
put them on to boil in cold water, with a piece of fat salt

A little cinnamon and salt. 

Boil the macaroni in the water until it is tender, and 
has soaked up the liquid. It must be cooked in a farina- 
kettle. Add the butter and salt. Cover for five min- 
utes without cooking. Put in the rest of the ingredients. 
Simmer, after the boil begins, ten minutes longer, before 
serving in a deep dish. Be careful, in stirring, not to 
break the macaroni. Eat with butter and powdered su- 
gar, or cream and sugar.

I quart of cold water. 
12 mealy potatoes. 
I onion. 
■J cup of rice. 



FOURTH WEEK—SUNDAY. ISI 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Seasoning to taste. 

Slice the potatoes, cover with boiling water, and cook 
ten minutes. Throw away this water, and add the quart 
of cold, slightly salted, and the onion, to the potatoes. 
Boil to pieces, and pass, with the water in which they 
were boiled, through a colander into the stock. Heat all 
together, and cook gently half anhour, before adding the 
rice, which should have been boiled soft in a very little 
water. When the rice is nearly dry, stir in the butter, put 
into the soup, and simmer five minutes. 

Roast Beef. 

A rib-roast is best for family use. Make your butcher 
saw off about half of the bone, after cutting the ends 
of the ribs clear of the meat ; then fold the flap neatly 
around to the thick part, and secure with skewers. The 
" trimmings " are yours — a fact housekeepers often fail 
to insist upon. The meat is weighed before you buy it. 
Take all that you pay for — and you will seldom be at a 
loss for a " base " for soup or gravy. Between butchers 
and cooks, tliere is enough wasted in American kitchens 
to supply a National Soup-house that might feed all the 
poor in the land. 

Put your beef in the dripping-pan ; pour a cup of boil- 
ing water over it, and roast ten minutes for every pound. 
Bake as soon as the juices begin to flow — the oftener in 
reason the better. If your meat has much fat on top, 
cover it — the fat — with a paste of flour and water. When 
nearly done, remove this, dredge the beef with flour, baste 
well with gravy, strew salt over the top, and serve. Pour 
the fat off from the gravy ; return to the fire, thicken 
with browned gravy, season, and boil up once. 

Sweet Potatoes — Baked. 

Parboil, take off the skins, and, half an hour before you 
take up your beef, lay the potatoes in the dripping-pan to 
brown, basting them with the meat. They should be of a 
fine brown. Drain off the grease, and lay about the beef 
when dished. 



1 52 FEBRUARY. 

Baked Hominy. 
I cupful of cold boiled hominy (small grained). 
.2 cups of milk. 

1 large teaspoonful of butter. 
The same of sugar. 

A little salt. 

2 eggs. 

Work the melted butter well into the hominy, mashing 
all lumps. Then come the beaten yolks ; next, sugar 
and salt ; then, gradually, the milk ; lastly the whites. 
Beat until perfectly smooth, and bake in a greased pud- 
ding-dish until delicately browned. Serve in the bake- 
dish. 

Cabbage Salad. 

Chop a firm white cabbage with a sharp knife. A dull 
one bruises it. Make a dressing of two tablespoonfuls of 
oil ; six of vinegar; a teaspoonful each of salt and sugar ; 
half as much each of madt mustard and pepper. Work 
all in well, the vinegar going in last, and then beat in a 
raw egg, whipped light. Pour over the salad, toss up 
with a fork, and serve in a glass dish. 

Arrow-root Pudding — (Cold). 

3 even tablespoonfuls of arrow-root. Get the Bermuda 

if you can, or you may require more. 

3 cups of fresh milk. 

2 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

I tablespoonful of butter. 

\ lb. of crystallized peaches, chopped fine. 

Heat the milk to scalding, and stir in the arrowroot 
wet up with cold milk. Stir ten minutes, and add sugar 
and butter. Stir five minutes more, and pour out.- When 
nearly cold, beat in the fruit. Pour into a wet mould. 
Make on Saturday, and on Sunday, turn out upon a dish, 
and eat with sugar and cream. It is very good without 
the fruit, but needs more sugar in making. 

Coffee 
Should be served last of all.

Bread Soup. 
Cannelon of Beef. Pork and Beans. 

Chow-chow. Potato Stew. 



Peach Batter Pudding. 



Bread Soup. 

A few raw beef-bones and trimmings, spoken of yester- 
day. Bones, bits of skin, gristle, etc., left from Sunday's 
roast when you have cut off tlae meat for the cannelon. 

I pint of stock. 

1 onion. 

2 stalks of celery. 
Bunch of sweet herbs. 
4 quarts of cold water.. 

1 lb. stale bread-crusts, the drier the better, provided 

they are not mouldy or sour. 
Salt and pepper. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

Crack the bones, chop meat and vegetables ; put on in 
the water, and boil slowly down to two quarts. Strain the 
liquor ; let it cool ; take off all the fat, season, and re- 
turn to the pot with the stock. Boil up and skim ; put in 
the crusts ; stew, covered, half an hour. Take it from the 
range and beat in the butter, taking out indissoluble bits. 
Then simmer, in a vessel set within another of boiling 
water, half an hour. 

As you will see, by a careful perusal of these directions, 
the preparation of this soup requires little actual expendi- 
ture of time. I beg, therefore, that you will " gather up 
the fragments " from larder and bread-box, and give your 
family a hot, nourishing, " comforting " dish of porridge, 
if it is wash-day. 

Cannelon of Beef. 

Cut the meat from your cold roast, and chop it fine. 
Season well, and beat into it the yolks of three eggs and 
the white of one. Add one-third as much cold mashed 



154 FEBRUARY. 

potato as you have meat, wet up with , gravy, and make, 
with flouped hands, into a long roll^-three times as long 
as it is broad. It should be just soft enough to handle. 
Dredge thickly with flour, and lay in a greased baking- 
pan. Invert another one over it, and bake until it is 
hissipg hot on top and sides, when uncover, and brown 
quickly. Brush over the outside with white of egg ; 
dredge again with flour, shut the oven-door to brown this, 
glaze again with egg, and shut up the oven for one mm- 
ute. Carefully, with the aid of a cake-turner, slip the 
cannelon to a hot dish and serve. 

Chow-chow 
Should go around with the cannelon. 

Potato Stew. 
Pare and cut the potatoes into dice. Stew in hot 
water, with a slice of fat salt pork, cut very small, half a 
minced onion and a little chopped parsley, until the pork 
is'dissolved and the potatoes very tender. Pepper, and 
if necessary, salt, and pour into a hot, deep dish. The 
" stew " should not be too liquid, nor yet stiff. 

Pork and Beans. 
This is a good, nourishing dish for Monday, and easily 
managed, if you have boiled the beans on Saturday. Fill 
a bake-dish nearly full of them, and put in the middle a 
piece of fat salt pork, about three inches wide, which you 
have parboiled in your soup. It will improve the taste 
of the " stock " and be itself the better for the temporary 
association. Pour in a little hot water to keep the beans 
from burning. Pepper and bdke, covered, for half an 
hour. Remove the cover and brown. 

Peach Batter Pudding. 
Open a can of peaches — whole ones, if you have them 
— and pour into the bottom of a buttered pudding-dish 
before you make your batter. There should be just 
syrup enough to half cover the fruit. 
For batter, take i quart of milk. 

lo tablespoonfuls ol prepared flour. 



FOURTH WEEK— TUESDAY. 155 

5 eggs, beaten light. 

I tablespoonful of melted butter. 

I saltspoonful of salt. 
Beat the yolks light, add the milk and salt, and pour 
slowly into a hole made in the middle of the flour. 
Finally, stir in the whites lightly, but not until you have 
beaten the batter smooth. Pour over the peaches and 
bake quickly. You can put it in the oven after the beans 
are done, setting the latter aside to keep warm. If you 
have not time to make sauce, eat with butter and sugar. 
Do not let the pudding stand after drawing from the oven, 
or it will fall.

and stew slowly three hours. Strain, cool and skim. 
Season and set back on the fire. Boil up and skim care- 
fully ; add the milk, and when hot, the corn-starch wet 
with cold water. As it thickens, take out a cupful; pour 
upon the eggs ; stir into the soup, and take at once from 
the tire. 



IS6 FEBRUARY 

Roast Breast of Veal. 

Make incisions between the ribs and the meat, and 
stuff with a force-meat of dry bread-crumbs, chopped pork 
or ham, pepper, sweet marjoram, and one beaten egg. 
Save a little to thicken the gravy. Roast slowly, basting 
often and copiously. Dredge at the last with flour, and 
baste well, when this has colored, with butter. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 
Stew a can of tomatoes twenty -five minutes ; season 
with pepper, salt, a little sugar, and a tablespoonful of 
butter. Cook five minutes and serve. 

Plain Boiled Potatoes. 
Pare very thin, and put on (after having lain half an 
hour in cold water) in boiling water. Cook fast until a 
fork will go easily into the largest ; drain off every drop 
of water, and throw in salt. Set back, uncovered, on the 
side of the range, or where they will dry quickly, yet not 
scorch. Serve in an uncovered dish. 

Celery. 
Wash, scrape, trim off the green tops, and throw aside 
for seasoning soups, vinegar, etc., the rank green stalks. 
Lay the better parts in cold water until wanted for the 
table. Put into a tall glass or celery-stand.

eggs and sugar, add the crumbs, beating into a good 
batter in a bowl ; then suet, flour, sago, and salt. Butter 
a mould thickly and lay the raisins, dredged with flour, in 
the bottom and sides, in whatever designs you fancy. 
Fill the mould with the batter — well beaten up at the last 
— putting it in by cautious spoonfuls not to dislodge the 
raisins, which should be imbedded in the butter. Put on 
the lid of the pudding mould, and boil one hour, never 
relaxing the heat. Dip in cold water and turn out upon a 
flat dish. Eat with jelly sauce. 

Jelly Sauce. 

■§• cup of currant jelly. 

2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter. 

I lemon — juice and half the grated peel. 

•J- teaspoonful of nutmeg. 

I tablesi^oonful of powdered sugar. 

I glass of wine. 

I cup of boiling water. 

I teaspoonful flour. 
Beat the hot water gradually into the jelly, and add 
the butter, lemon, and nutmeg. Warm almost to a boil, 
put in the sugar, then the flour wet up with cold water. 
Boil up once sharply ; add the wine, and take from the 
fire. Set, closely covered, in a vessel of hot water until 
wanted. Stir well before pouring it out. 



Julienne Soup. 
Veal and Ham Pie. Halibut Steaks, Broiled. 

Scallopsd Potatoes. Stewed CauliEower. 

Pancakes with Preserves. 



Julienne Soup. • 

2 lbs. of mutton, and a like quantity of veal, with some 
beef-bones. 



IS8 FEBRUARY. 

2 carrots. 

2 turnips. 
Half a cabbage. 

3 onions. 

3 stalks oi blanched cAtcf. 
■J can of tomatoes. 
5 quarts of cold water. 
2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 
2 teaspoonfuls of sugar. 
Bunch of sweet herbs. 
Pepper and salt. 

Cut the meat small, crack the tones, and put on to 
cook in five quarts of water with the herbs. While it 
simmers, prepare the vegetables, with the exception of 
the cabbage and tomatoes, by cleaning, paring, and cutting 
them into narrow strips about two inches long, and as 
nearly as possible of uniform size. Lay them in cold 
water for one hour. Drain very dry, and put them into a 
frying-pan in which you have melted, but not cooked, the 
butter, and dissolved the sugar. Toss them over a hot 
fire until they are coated with the butter, but do not let 
them scorch. Set aside in a clean vessel set within one 
of hot water. When the meat has boiled to rags, and 
the liquid is reduced one-third, strain it and set by until the 
fat rises and can be taken off. Return the soup to the fire, 
season, boil up and skim ; add the glazed vegetables, 
with the chopped cabbage — which should have been par- 
boiled, then drained — and the tomatoes, cut up small. 
Stew gently for one hour. Serve with the vegetables in 
it. ■ 

This will make enough soup for two days, unless your 
family be large. 

Halibut Steaks — Broiled. 

Wash and wipe the steaks dry. Broil upon a buttered 
gridiron, turning when the lower side is done. Remove 
carefully to a chafing-dish, and anoint with a mixture of 
btitter, salt, pepper, and a little lemon-juice. 

Always serve fish upon hot plates. Pass potatoesj and 
no other vegetable, with it. 



FOURTH WEEK— WEDNESDAY. 1 59 

Scalloped Potatoes. 

3 cups of mashed potatoes. 

3 tablespoon&ils of milk. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

Yolks of four hard-boiled eggs. (Cut the whites in 
rings to garnish your fish.) * 

Handful of dry bread-crumbs. 

Salt and pepper. 

Beat butter, milk, and seasoning into the potatoes while 
hot. Put a layer in the bottom of a buttered pudding- 
dish ; cover this with thin slices of yolk ; pepper and salt 
them ; spread another layer of potato over these, and 
proceed in this order until the dish is full, having the top 
layer of potato. Strew thickly with bread-crumbs. Bake 
covered until hot through, then brown quickly. Serve 
in the bake-dish. 

Veal and Ham Pie 
Cut the meat from the cold roast of yesterday. Put the 
bones, well-cracked, the refuse bits of meat and skin into 
a saucepan with an onion, a few spoonfuls of tomatoes, 
and three cups of cold water, and cook slowly until there 
remains but one cup of gravy. Strain and season, thick- 
ening with a tablespoonful of browned flour. Cut the 
veal into small, even slices. If you have no cold boiled 
ham, cook half a pound on purpose by boiling in your 
gravy stock. Slice this also, and lay upon the veal, with 
now and then a slice of hard-boiled egg. Fill the dish 
with alternate layers of veal and ham ; pour in the gravy, 
and cover with a thick crust of good pastry, such as you 
made last Thursday for your pork-pie. Bake one hour. 

Stewed Cauliflower. 
When your soup is about half done, and before you 
strain it, take out a cupful, strain through a thin cloth, and 
put into a saucepan, with a little salt and a tablespoonful 
of butter. Cut a cauliflower into small bunches, when you 
have washed and trimmed it, and lay these in the cooled 
broth. Stew slowly, covered, twenty-five minutes, turning 
the bunches now and then. When they are tender, take 
them out, lay in a covered dish to keep warm, stir into the 



l60 FEBRUARY. 

broth a tablespoonful of butter, cut into bits and rolled in 
flour, with nearly half a cup of milk. Pepper, boil up 
once, and pour over the cauliflower. 

Pancakes with Preserves. 

I pint of i)repared flour. 

About a quart of milk. 

6 eggs. 

A little salt. 
Beat the yolks light, add the salt and two cups of milk, 
then the flour and beaten whites alternately, and thin with 
more milk until the batter is of the right consistency. It 
should be quite thin. Have ready in a small frying-pan a 
tablespoonful of butter or sweet lard, hissing hot, but not 
discolored by too long heating. Pour in enough batter to 
cover the bottom of the jian, and fry quickly, pouring off 
the fat so soon as the cakes set. Turn it with a lift of your 
spatula and a skilful toss of the pan at the same time. 
As fast as the pancakes are done — the same lard will do 
for several — let an assistant spread each upon a hot plate 
and cover with sweet jam or jelly, rolling up neatly so 
soon as this is done. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, and 
set in a warm oven until you are ready for dessert.

Chicken Broth. 

Draw, stuffi and truss a pair of chickens, as for roasting ; 

tie soft pack-thread around their legs and wings, binding 

them close to their bodies, and put on to boil in four 

quarts of cold w?.ter, a little salted. They will require at 



FOURTH WEEK— THURSDAY. l6l 

least one hour's boiling, if they are of fair size. Do not 
cook fast, especially at first. Try with a fork if they are 
tender, and if it pierces the breast easily, take them up, , 
butter well, and set in a warm place, covered. Take out 
a cupful of liquor when they are three-quarters done, in 
which to cook your rice. Strain the broth after taking out 
the fowls, season with pepper and chopped parsley and 
put again over the fire. Take off the scura, as it rises, and 
boil hard fifteen minutes. Then add a half cupful of rice, 
previously stewed soft in a very little water. Simmer a 
quarter of an hour ; pour in a cup of milk in which has 
been stirred a tablespoonful of rice-flour ; bring to a slow 
boil, and pour a few spoonfuls upon two beaten eggs. 
Return these to the soup, stir them in and take from the 
fire. Have ready the giblets and one hard-boiled egg 
chopped fine in the bottom of the tureen, and turn in the 
broth upon them. 

Chickens and Rice. 
Parboil a cup of rice in a little water. When it has 
taken it up, and is about half done, add the cupful of broth 
taken from the soup, seasoned well. Cook the rice slowly 
in it until done. (Always cook rice in a farina-kettle, and 
shake, instead of stirring.) It should absorb all the gravy. 
At the last, stir in a beaten egg, mixed with a tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter. It is best to do this with a fork, and 
not a spoon. Make a low, flattened mound of the rice 
upon a hot dish ; remove the pack-threads from the 
chickens and lay them on the top. Pass grated cheese 
with it. 

Potato Croquettes. 

To each cupful of mashed potato, add half a raw egg, 
beaten light, a little salt and pepper, and half a teaspoon- 
ful of butter. Beat well. Make into oblong balls, or rolls, 
flour well and fry. a few at a time, in boiling lard, or drip- 
ping. Drain off the fat and serve hot. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. 
Select those of uniform size, wash, wipe, and boil until 
a fork will penetrate them easily. Skin, set in the oven a 
moment to dry, and send to table.

I egg, beaten light. 

I tablespoonful of sugar. 

\ even tablespoonful of corn-starch. 

I teaspoonful essence of celery. 

Pepper and salt to taste. 
Rub butter and sugar together and pour over them the 
hot milk. Beat into these the frothed egg. Put into a 
vessel set within another of hot water, add the corn-starch 
wet up with cold water, boil slowly until it thickens, and 
set aside. In another saucepan scald the vinegar ; put in 
the pepper and salt with essence of celery, and pour hot 
over the cabbage. Mix up well ; put back into the sauce- 
pan, and stir briskly over the fire until it is smoking all 
through, but not until it boils. Turn it into a bowl, stir 
into it the custard with a silver fork, until well mixed ; 
cover, to keep in the strength of the vinegar, and set it 
where it will cool suddenly. It is very fine. 

Poor Man's Plum Pudding.

I quart of milk. 

Small loaf of stale bread. 

I tablespoonful of sugar. 

\ lb. seeded raisins, cut in two. 

Cinnamon to taste.

Slice the bread and cut off all the crust. Butter thinly 
and lay in order in a a/if/Z-greased pudding-dish, strew- 
ing each layer with raisins. Heat the milk, put' in sugar 
and salt, and pour over the beaten eggs. Lay a heavy 
saucer upon the top of the bread and soak with the 
custard. Let all stand half an hour, then set in a drip- 
ping-pan' of boiling water, cover closely, and cook one 
hour, keeping the pan full of water at a hard boil. Turn 
out and eat with liquid sauce.

Chicken Pates. Cheese Fingers. 

Mashed Potatoes. Mashed Turnips. 



Sweet Potato Pudding. 



Wednesday's Soup. 
The Julienne soup which, as I stated in. the receipt for 
making it, was sufficient for two days, will have kept per- 
fectly well in the refrigerator, or in any cold closet. You 
have now only to warm it over — not quite to the boil, and 
it will be even better than upon the first day. It is wise, 
sometimes, to skip a day with a rechauffe, for fear of 
wearying those for whose comfort your bills-of-fare are 
made up". 

Boiled Cod. 

Sew up the piece of fish in a thin cloth, fitted neatly to 
the shape, and boil in salted water' (boiling from the first), 
allowing about fifteen minutes per pound. Unwrap care- 
fully and pour over it a sauce made thus ^ 

Heat half a cup of milk and as much' water together ; 
stir in a tablespoonful of butter, cut into bits and rolled in 
flour, and when it has thickened, pour by degrees upon 
two beaten eggs. Put back into the saucepan and stir 
for one minute ; add salt, chopped parsley, and a dozen 
capers or nasturtium seeds. Take at once from the fire. 

Chicken PatSs. 

Line your pat6-pans with a good paste, made according 
to either of the receipts already given this month, and 
bake in a brisk oven. 

Mince the chicken left from yesterday. Put the bones 
and stuffing into a saucepan with two cups'of cold water, 
and stew down to one cup of gravy. Season this well, add 



1 64 FEBRUARY. 

three tablespoonfuls of milk when j'ou have strained out 
the bones, a tablespoonful of butter, and a very little par- 
sley. The stuffing should thicken it sufficiently. Stir in 
the chicken, warm until hot, but do not let it boil, or it 
will be spoiled. Fill the paste-shells, having taken them 
from the tins; arrange upon a hot dish and set within an 
open oven until they are sent to table. 

Cheese Fingers. 

Cut good pastry, left from your pat6s, into strips three 
inches long and two inches wide. Strew with grated 
cheese, season with pepper and salt ; double the paste 
upon this lengthwise, and bake in a quick oven. Brush 
over with beaten egg just before taking them up, and 
sift a little powdered cheese upon them. 

Pile, log-cabin-wise, upon a folded napkin laid within a 
flat dish, and eat without delay, as they are not good cold. 

Mashed Potatoes and Mashed Turnips. 

The receipts for these standard dishes having been 
already given this month, it is scarcely necessary to repeat 
them here. Bear in mind, always, that they must be 
served hot, and the turnips be well drained. 

Sweet Potato Pudding. 

I lb. parboiled sweet potatoes. 

\ cup of butter. 

I cup of white sugar. 

I tablespoonful of cinnamon. 

4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately. 

I teaspoonful of nutmeg. 

I lemon, juice and grated rind. 

I glass of brandy. 

Let the potatoes get entirely cold, and grate them. 
Cream- the butter and sugar; add the yolks, spice arid 
lemon. Beat the potato in by degrees, to a light paste ; 
then the brandy, lastly the whites. Bake in a buttered 
dish, and eat cold.

1 lb. of beef — ^lean, also cut up. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Pepper. 

5 quarts of water — cold. 
1 onion, minced. 

Cover beans, meat, onions, and half the celery cut into 
bits, with the water, and boil to pieces, and until the 
liquid is reduced one-third. Rub the beans and celery 
through a fine colander into the soup. Return to the fire, 
season with pepper, put in the rest of the celery, cut into 
inch-lengths, and simmer half an hour, stirring often, that 
it may not " catch " on the bottom. Set aside a quart of 
it, if you can spare as much, for Monday's soup. 

Jugged Pigeons. 

Clean and wash well, and stuff with a dressing made of 
the giblets boiled and chopped, a shce of fat pork also 
minced fine ; the yolks of two hard eggs rubbed to pow- 
der, some bread-crumbs, pepper and salt, bound with a 
beaten raw egg. Tie the legs and wings close to their 
bodies, and pack the pigeons in a tin pail with a tight 
top. Plunge this into a pot of boiling water; put a 
weight on top to keep it steady, and cook two hours and 
a half. The water should not boil over the top.* Drain 
off the gravy into a saucepan, thicken with a tablespoon- 



1 66 FEBRUARY. 

ful of butter rolled in flour. Season, boil up, pour over 
the pigeons. Cover again, . and leave in the hot water 
ten minutes before serving. 

Shred Macaroni. 

Break half a pound of pipe macaroni into pieces two 
inches long, and cook in boiling water, a little salted, ten 
minutes. Drain off the water, and spread the macaroni 
out to cool upon a dish. When cold, take a sharp knife 
or a pair of scissors, and split each piece in half, length- 
wise. Put on in a farina-kettle with a cup of hot milk 
and a tablespoonful of butter, seasoning with pepper and 
salt. Cover and stew tender, but not to breaking, Ten 
minutes after the boil should do this. Then stir in three 
tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. Serve in a deep dish. 

Brussels-Sprouts. 

Wash and pick over very carefully. Put on in plenty 
of boiling water with a little salt, and cook fifteen minutes 
after the water begins to boil anew. Drain well and pile 
upon a dish, with drawn butter poured over them. 

Sponge-Cake Fritters. 

8 penny sponge-cakes — very stale. 

I cup of boiling milk, with a pinch of soda stirred in, 

4 eggs whipped light. 

I tablespoonful of flour wet up in cold milk. 

\ lb. currants, washed and dried. 

Roll the cakes into fine crumbs ;- pour over them the 
hot milk, with the soda and flour stirred, into it. Cover 
for fifteen minutes, .then beat until cold. Add the 
whipped eggs — the yolks first, then the whites ; finally, 
the currants dredged with flour. Beat all well. Drop in 
great spoonfuls in boiling lard, trying one first to be sure 
that the batter is of the right consistency ; drain quickly 
in a hot colander ; sprinkle with powdered sugar mixed 
with nutmeg, and serve hot.

4 quarts of cold water. 

Crack the bones and mince the meat, onion, and pars- 
ley. Cover with the water, and boil gently three hours, 
or until the stock has diminished one-half. Strain, season, 
boil up and skim. Add the mushrooms, drained from the 
can liquor, and sliced. Stew twenty minutes ; put in the 
milk, the flour, wet up in cold water, and when it thickens, 
beat a cupful into the whipped eggs. Stir into this the 
butter, return to the soup, let it almost boil, and pour out. 

To the lovers of mushrooms this is a delicious soup. 

Roast Ducks.

with a dressing made of bread-crumbs, the hard-boiled 



l68 MARCH. 

yolk of an egg, a little minced sage and onion. Rub the 
inside of the other with melted butter, pepper and salt. 
Many do not like the taste of onion and sage, while others 
do not enjoy roast duck without the flavor of these con- 
diments. Put the fowls into the dripping-pan, pour a cup 
of boiling water over them, and roast about an hour, 
basting frequently. At the last, dredge with flour, and 
baste with butter ; then brown. Chop the giblets fine, 
pour the fat from the top of the gravy in the dripping- 
pan, thicken with browned flour that which is left, and 
stir in the giblets. 

Green Peas 

Have, from time immemorial, been the adjunct of roast 
ducks. As the best substitute to be had at this season, 
open a can of preserved green peas — the P^rench cans 
are best ; let them stand an hour to get rid of the airless 
taste that is apt to cling to canned vegetables ; pour off 
the liquor ; cook twenty minutes in boiling water, a little 
salt; drain dry, and stir up in them a teaspopnful of but- 
ter, with pepper to your liking. =

buttered pudding-dish ; bake, covered, one hour, then 
brown. Serve in the bake-dish. 

Spinach in a Mould. 
Pick over carefully, clip off the stems and put on the 
leaves in boiling water, with salt stirred in. Boil hard 
fifteen minutes. When done, drain, pressing out all the 
water. Chop fine ; put back into the saucepan with a 
piece of butter — a large spoonful for a good dish — a little 
powdered sugar, salt and pepper to taste: Stir and toss 
until very hot ; press hard into a mould wet with hot 
water, and turn out with care upon a heated dish. Lay 
round slices of hard-boiled eggs on the top. 

Turret Cream. 

i^ quart of milk. 

I package Coxe's gelatine. 

I heaping cup of white sugar.

^ lb. crystallized fruit. 

Vanilla flavoring. 

Juice of a lemon in which half the grated peel has been 
soaked, then strained out. 

Soak the gelatine three hours in a large cup of cold 
water. Scald the milk, stir in the sugar, and when this 
has melted, the gelatine. Stir over the fire five minutes ; 
pour out half of the mixture into a bowl, and add the 
whipped yolks to that left in the saucepan. Stir one 
minute, and take from the fire. Flavor the yellow gelatine 
with lemon — the white with vanilla. As soon as the yellow- 
begins to congeal, whip one-half of the stiffened whites 
into it, a little at a time, with a Dover egg-beater. Add 
the rest to the white gelatine, in the same manner, whip- 
ping each in until it stiffens before adding more, and not 
ceasing until both are heaps of " sponge." Wet the in- 
side of a tall fluted mould with water, and arrange «f the 
bottom, close to the outside of the mould, a row of crys- 
tallized cherries. Then, put in a layer of the white mix-

Beef Soup with Barley. 

Stuffed Loin of Veal. 

Baked Tomatoes. Kidney Beans with Sauce. 



Plain Boiled Pudding. 
Hard Sauce. 



Beef Soup with Barley. 
3 lbs. of beef from the shin. 
2 lbs. of bones. 



FIRST WEEK— THURSDAY. 177 

1 onion stuck with cloves. 

2 stajks of celery. 

The half can of tomatoes left from yesferday's soup. 

2 turnips. 

Nearly a cup of pearl barley. 

4 quarts of water. 

Pepper and salt. 

Cut up the meat and crack the bones. Cut up celery, 
turnips, and tomatoes. Put all these, with the onion, into 
the soup-pot, with the gallon of cold water, and boil gently 
three hours. The liquor should be reduced one-third. 
Wash the barley and boil fifteen minutes in a very little 
water. Strain the soup, pressing hard. Season ; let it 
boil up once, and skim before adding the barley and the 
water in which it has boiled. Simmer half an hour, and 
serve. 

Stuffed Loin of Veal. 

Prepare a dressing of bread-crumbs, a little chopped 
corned ham, parsley, pepper and salt, moistened with 
milk. Have the bones taken out of the meat, and fill the 
holes thus' left with the stuffing. Secure the meat into a 
good shape with skewers, and cover the top and sides with 
thick foolscap paper, binding it with strings. Grease 
paper and strings, put the veal into your dripping-pan 
with a cup of hot water, and bake, basting the paper now 
and then with dripping, to prevent scorching. At the 
end of an hour, take out the meat and remove the paper. 
Pour off the gravy, carefully setting it by; return the 
meat to the oven with a cupful of milh'xci the pan instead 
of the gravy. Baste with butter, lavishly, once, — afterwards, 
and often with the milk as it heats. Roast, not too fast, 
nearly an hour more, or until your meat is tender. Should 
the milk evaporate too rapidly, add a little hot water. 
Indeed, this is a wise precaution against scorching. Take 
up the veal, thicken the gravy left in the oven, with a 
tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour, salt,, and pepper, 
heat carefully that the milk may not "catch," and pour 
some over the meat, serving the rest in a boat. Veal 
cooked in this way is very nice, but requires much atten- 
tion at the last. 



178 MARCH. 

Baked Tomatoes. 
Strew the bottom of a pie-dish with fine crumbs, Slaving 
gteased it first. Drain off much of the liquor from a can 
of tomatoes, add it to the soup, pour the tomatoes upon 
the crumbs, season with pepper, salt, and butter ; strew 
more crumbs thickly over the top. Bake, covered, twenty 
minutes ; then brown. 

Kidney Beans with Sauce. 

Soak the beans overnight. The next day boil them 
until soft in salted water. Drain this off. Strain the first 
gravy taken from the roast veal — before the milk is sub- 
stituted' — into a saucepan ; add a tablespoonful of butter, 
and half a small onion, minced. Boil five minutes, strain 
through a soup-sieve, pressing the onion hard ; season 
with pepper, salt, and a little chopped parsley ; pour over 
the beans, simmer fifteen minutes, closely covered, drain 
off half of the liquor, and serve in a covered dish. 

Plain Boiled Pudding.

Heat slowly, and as soon as they "ruffle," which should 
be about five minutes after they reach the boil, strain oif 
the soup. Have in another vessel as much boiling milk as 
there* was oyster liquor. Pour the oysters into a hot 
tureen, put a large spoonful of butter upon them ; when 
it melts entirely, turn in the milk. Stir in well, add the 
hot soup, cover, and serve with sliced lemon and crackers. 

Brown Fricassee of Chicken.

sliced onion. Chop the pork fine and put into a sauce- 
pan ; next, the onion ; at last, the fowl. Spiinkle a tea- 
spoonful of mixed allspice and cloves over all, pour on 
cold water to cover them well, put on a tight lid, and 
stew gently for an hour or more, until the meat is tender.

Potatoes au Naturel. 
Choose those of uniform size ; put on in their skins, in 
boiling water. When about half done, check the boil sud- 
denly bya cupful of cold water. This is said to make old 
potatoes mealy. Boil again until a fork will pierce them.

crack, and dry out in the uncovered pot, on the range, for 
a few minutes before peeling. 

Sliced Apple Pie.-

flatten, and re-roll as thin as at first ; then baste again. 
Repeat this three times. Set the last roll in a cold place 
for at least an hour. Roll out, and" line two buttered 
pie-plates, reserving enough for upper crusts. 

Pare, core and slice juicy pippins ; put a layer within 
the crust ; sprinkle sugar liberally over it, strew half a 
dozen whole cloves upon this ; then more apples, etc., 
until the dish is full. Cover with crust and bake.

with bread-crumbs ; then more apple. Wh^n your dish 
is full, cover with crumbs. Invert a tin plate over it, and 
" steam " forty-five minutes in a good oven. Then, un- 
cover and brown. Eat warm, with sugar and butter, or 
cream. 

,Tea and Albert Biscuit. 

Pass these after the pudding. Tea-drinking is restful 
as well as refreshing on a busy da,y. Weary housekeepers 
can have no more innocent nervine.

incision. Sew the shoulder into a neat shape in a piece 
of stout tarlatan ; put on in boiling water, slightly salted, 
allowing eighteen minutes to each pound in cooking. 
When done, unbind carefuU)' upon the dish in which you

of fat from the brotS set by jresterday. Put a half cupful 
aside for yoiu: macaroni sauce. Warm the rest and strain 
out the bones, etc. Return to the fire, boil up and skim, 
chop the giblets fine and put them in with the water in 
which they wefe boiled. Simmer a quarter of an hour ; 
stir in half a cupful of fine, dry bread-crumbs. Season, 
if necessary ; boil ten minutes longer, stirring often, and 
pour out. 

Smothered Chickens. 

Prepare the chickens as for broiling, splitting each 
down the back. Lay flat in a dripping-pan, pour a cup- 
ful of boiling water upon them ; set in the oven and in- 
vert another pan over them, so as to cover them tightly. 
Roast half an hour, lift the cover and baste freely with 
butter. In ten minutes more, baste with gravy from the 
dripping-pan. In five more, with melted butter — abun- 
dantly — going all over the fowls. Keeping the chickens 
covered except while basting them, increase the heat, 
until you ascertain, by testing with a fork, that they are 
done. They should be coffee-colored all over, rather 
than brown, pish, salt and pepper them ; cover while 
you thicken the gravy with browned flour, adding a little 
hot water, pepper, salt, and chopped parsley. Boil up ; 
put a few spoonfuls over the chickens — the rest in a 
gravy tureen. 

They are extremely nice, if faithfully basted. 



SECOND WEEK—WEDNESDAY. 1 89

fuls grated cheese ; boil once and strain over the maca- 
roni, loosening the latter with a fork that the sauce may 
penetrate. Serve hot.

Chicken Broth'. 
Cut an old fowl into quarters. Lay in salt and water 
an hour ; put on in a soup-kettle with an onion, and four 
quarts of water. Bring very slowly to a gentle boil, and 
keep this up until the liquid has diminished one-third, and 
the meat shrinks from the bones. Take out the chicken, 
salt it, and set aside with a cupful of the broth, in a bowl 
(covered), until to-morrow. Season the rest of the broth 
and put back over the fire. Boil up and skim, and add 
nearly a teacupful of rice, previously soaked for two 
hours in a cup of water. Cook slowly until the rice is

leaving a brown glaze upon the steak. Spread it upon a 
dish. Chop the onion, mix with bread-crumbs, minced 
herbs and a few chopped mushrooms, and lay this force- 



SECOND WEEK— THURSDAY. IQI 

meat upon the steak. Roll the meat up tightly upon the 
dressing. Fasten with soft packthread and skewers. 
Put into a saucepan with a cupful of cold water. Set 
where it will heat very slowly, keeping on a close lid. 
Simmer thus two hours, turning now and then. Transfer 
the meat to a hot dish. Strain the gravy, add a little hot 
water, if needed ; thicken with browned flour ; stir in 
some minced mushrooms, a tablespoonful of catsup and 
another of butter. Boil about three minutes, pour over 
the steak, when you have removed the threads. The 
skewers are to be withdrawn by the carver. 

Salsify Fritters. 
Scrape, .wash, and grate the roots into a mixture made 
of a beaten egg, one cup of milk, and enough flour for a 
very thin batter. Thicken with the grated salsify ; salt 
and pepper, and drop, in large spoonfuls, into boiling lard 
or dripping. Drain 'in a hot colander. Eat while fresh. 

Scalloped Tomatoes. 
Drain off the liquor from a can of tomatoes ; salt it, 
and put aside for another day's soup. Strew the bottom 
of a bake-dish with fine crumbs ; cover with tomatoes, 
sliced thin. Scatter over these a little minced onion and 
some bits of butter, with pepper, salt, and sugar. Pro- 
ceed thus until the tomatoes are used up. Cover thickly 
with crumbs, fit a plate or tin lid over the scallop, and 
bake half an hour. Brown quickly upon the upper grat- 
ing of the oven.

192 MARCH. 

return to the farina-kettle, and cook until it thickens well. 
Set by to cool. Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff 
froth. Melt the soaked gelatine by adding two table- 
spoonfuls of boiling water, and setting it within a vessel 
of hot water. Stir until melted, and let it cool. When 
it begins to congeal, whip with the Dover egg-beater, 
gradually, into the whisked whites, until all is white and 
thick. Beat into the cold custard rapidly and thoroughly, 
and fill the fig-lined mould. Set on ice, or in a cold 
place, until firm. Dip the mould in hot water to loosen 
the pudding when you are ready for it. It is delicious.

2 stalks of celery. 

Bunch of sweet herbs. 

Salt and pepper. 

\ cup tapioca, soaked two hours in one cup of cold water. 

5 quarts of water. 

Put on the bones and vegetables early in the day. Pur- 
chase soup meat a day beforehand, whenever you can. 
Cover with half the water. When the scum arises after 
the boil is reached, remove it, and pour in another quart 
of cold water. This will bring up more scum. Skim, 
after boiling again, and pour in the rest of the water. 
When no more scum conies up, cover the pot, and cook 
gently four hours, if you can give it so much time. Divide 
the liquor into two parts. Set away half in a stone jar, 
with the bones in the bottom, fit on the lid, having salted 
the liquor. This is Sunday's "stock." Strain the rest

and strew almond shavings over it. Fit on another stratum 
of bread, soaking it likewise with milk, more of the suet and 
fruit mixture, sugar and almonds, and so on to the top- 
most layer which must be bread, and very moist with milk. 
Cover the mould, set in a dripping-pan, which you must 
keep full of boiling water, and cook in the oven one hour 
and a half. Pass a knife carefully between the pudding 
and the sides of the mould ; turn it out ; sift white sugar 
thickly over it and eat with sweet sauce. You may have

of preserved lobster, freed from bones and cut up small. 
Cover and stand in a pot of hot water ten minutes before 
pouring out.

and scarcely any bone. Put iji the dripping-pan, pour a 
cup of boiling water over it, and roast carefully, basting 
often with its own gravy. When nearly done, dredge 
with flour and baste once with butter. Do not let it once 
get dry while cooking. Allow about ten minutes per 
pound if you like it rare and juicy — that is, if your oven 
be of moderate heat. Pour the fat from the gravy, thicken 
what is left with browned flour, pepper, and salt, boil up, 
and put into a gravy-boat. Pass made mustard with it. 

Mashed Potatoes. 
Please see receipt given last Friday. 

Canned- Succotash. 

Open the can an hour before it is to be cooked, and 
turn into a bowl. Drain off the liquor, put the succotash 
into a saucepan, cover with boiling water, and stew half 
an hour. Throw off half the water, and add as much cold 
milk. When it boils, put in a tablespoonful of butter, 
cut into quarters and rolled in flour ; pepper and salt ; 
simmer five minutes and serve in a vegetable-dish. 

Apple Trifle. 

2 heaping cupfuls of good apple sauce, well sweetened 
and flavored with grated lemon peel. 

4 eggs. 

2 cups of milk. 

4 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Heat the milk, and pour over the beaten yolks and 
sugar. Put back in a farina-kettle, and stir until it begins 
to thicken, say about eight minutes. Set by in a shallow 
vessel to cooL Beat the whites very stiff, then. whip grad- 
ually into the apple. When all is in, and well beaten, pile 
up in a glass dish, and pour the cold custard about the 
base.

TffIRD WEEM— WEDNESDAY. 203 

Mock-TuTtle Soup. 

Veal Cutlets and Brains. Potatoes au Gratin. 

Lettuce. Stewed Tomatoes and Onion. 



Steamed Bread Pudding. 



Mock-Turtle Soup. 

1 calf's head, well-cleaned, with the skin on. 

2 onions. 

Bunch of sweet herbs. 

5 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

5 tablespoonfuls of browned flour. 

I tablespoonful of allspice. 

\ teaspoonful of mace. 

1 teaspoonful of pepper. 

2 teaspoonfuls, at least, of salt. 
2 raw eggs. 

A little flour. 

2 glasses of brown sherry. 

I tablespoonful mushroom, or walnut catsup. 

5 quarts of water, cold, of course. 

I sliced lemon. 
Soak the calPshead an hour in cold water, and boil in the 
five quarts of water until the bones will slip easily from 
the flesh. Take out the head, leaving the bones and 
broth in the pot. Take out the tongue and brains, and 
put them in separate plates. Set aside, also, the cheeks 
and the fleshy parts of the scalp to cool. Chop the rest, 
including the ears, very fine. Reserve four spoonfuls of 
this for force-meat balls. Season the rest with pepper, 
salt, onion, allspice, herbs, and mace, and put back into 
the pot. Cover closely, and cook four hours. Should 
the liquor sink to less than four quarts, replenish with 
boiling water. Just before straining the soup, take out 
half a cupful ; put into a frying-pan ; heat, and stir in the 
browned flour, wet up in cold water, also the butter. 
Simmer these together ten minutes, stirring almost con- 
stantly. Strain the soup ; scald the pot and return the 



204 maAch. ^ 

broth to the fire. Have ready the tongiie and fleshy parts 
of the head cut, after cooling, into small squares ; also, 
about fifteen balls made of the chopped meat,- highly- 
seasoned, worked into the praper consistency with a little 
flour aild bound with the raw eggs, beaten into the paste. 
They should' be as soft as can be handled. Grease a pie- 
plate, flour the balls and set in a quick oven until a crust 
forms upon them, then cool. Now, thicken the strained 
broth with the mixture in the frying-pan, stirred in well. 
Should there not be enough to make it almost like cus- 
tard, add more flour. Then drop in the dice of tongue 
and fat meat. Cook slowly five minutes. Put the force- 
meat balls and thin slices of a peeled lemon into the 
tureen. Pour the soup upon them, add catsup and wine ; 
cover five minutes and serve. 

This king of soups having, of right, received such a long 
and minute notice, I shall not repeat the receipt in full 
in this work, but take the liberty of referring you, from 
time to time, to that just given. 

Veal Cutlets and Brains. 
Flatten the cutlets with the broad side of a hatchet ; 
dip in beaten egg, then in cracker-dust, and fry rather 
slowly in ham-dripping, if you have it ; if not, in salted 
lard. Drain off the fat ; put into a hot-water dish, pepper, 
and cover while you fry, in the same fat, after straining it, 
the brains from the head of which your soup was made. 
They should first have been boiled for ten minutes, 
drained, and cooled ; then beaten to a paste with egg, 
seasoned with pepper and salt, and dropped by the spoon- 
ful into the scalding fat. Drain, and lay about the cut- 
lets as a garnish. 

Potatoes au Gratin. 
Mash as usual; put into a shallow pie -plate well 
greased ; strew thickly with dry crumbs, and brown upon 
the upper grating of the oven. Glaze with butter, when 
the gratin begins to brown well. Slip dexterously to a 
flat dish. 

Stewed Tomatoes and Onion. 
To one can of tomatoes add a small onion, minced 
fine. Season with pepper, salt, a little sugar, and stew

twenty-five minutes. Stir in a tablespoonful of butter; 
cook two minutes, and serve. 

Lettuce. 
Treat as directed on last Sunday. 

Steamed Bread Pudding. 
2 cups of milk. 

2 cups fine bread-crumbs. 
■J lb. suet, powdered. 

^ lb. Sultana raisins, picked, washed, dried, and dredged 
with flour. 

3 eggs. 

I even tablespoonfiil of corn-starch. 

I tablespoonful of sugar. 

A little salt. 

Heat the milk ; pour over the eggs and sugar, beaten 
together. Stir in the corn-starch ; cook one minute, and 
pour upon the bread-crumbs, beating all to a batter. 
Put a layer of this in the bottom of a buttered pudding- 
mould. Cover this with suet ; then with raisins ; sprinkle 
with sugar ; then more butter, and proceed in the fore- 
going order until the mould is nearly full. Fit on the top, 
put into the steamer over a pot of boiling water, and 
steam at least two hours. If you have no steamer, boil 
one hour and a half. When done, dip the mould into cold 
water for half a minute, and turn out, with care, upon a 
hot, flat dish. Eat hot with wine sauce. 



Curry Soup. 

Stewed Beef. Bermuda Potatoes, au Naturel. 

Macaroni, Baked. Gherkin Pickles. 

White Puffs. 



Custard Sauce. 



Curry Soup. 
You can, if you dislike the taste of curry, warni up 
what was left from your mock-turtle soup, just as it is. 



206 MARCH. 

But you can vary it, agreeably to most palates, by stirring 
into it, when melted, and almost on the boil, a tablespoon- 
ful of curry powder, if there be more than three pints of 
soup— half as much, should there be but a quart. Wet 
the powder up in cold water, add to the soup, and cook 
three minutes. 

Stewed Beef. 

3 lbs. of beef— not too lean — coarse steak or brisket. 

I chopped onion. 

Bunch of thyme, sweet marjoram, and summer savory. 

Pepper, salt, parsley. 

\ teaspoonful of allspice. 

I tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce. 

I tablespoonful of browned flour. 

1 pint of cold water. 

\ glass of wine. 

Cut the meat into strips about an inch long. Cover 
with a pint of water, and stew gently two hours. The 
meat should be ready to fall to pieces. Add the onion 
and herbs cut up fine, the spice, salt and pepper, and 
stew half an hour, closely covered. Then stir in the 
browned flour, and when it has thickened, the sauce and 
wine. Cover the bottom of a deep dish with strips of 
fried bread, and pour the stew over it. If cooked long 
and slowly enough, it will be a rich brown mixture, with 
no hard lumps of meat in it. Save half a cupful of gravy 
for to-morrow. 

Bermuda Potatoes — au Naturel. 
Wash and boil in hot salted water, until a fork will 
easily pierce them. Drain off the water, throw salt over 
them, and "dry oflf" upon the range for a few minutes. 
Peel, and serve whole. 

Baked Macaroni. 
Break half a pound of macaroni into short pieces ; 
cook in boiling water, salted, twenty minutes. Drain, 
put a layer into a greased bake-dish ; strew thickly with 
grated cheese, and stick bits of butter over it. Go on in 
this order until the dish is full, strewing cheese and but- 
ter on top. Pour in a cup of milk ; bake, covered, thirty 
minutes ; then brown nicely. Serve in the pudding-dish.

with clams ; sprinkle with pepper, salt, and bits of butter^ 
then with minced onion. Next, have a stratum of small 
crackers, split and soaked in warm milk. When the pot 
has been filled in this order, cover all with cold water, 
and cook slowly (after the water is heated) three-quarters 
of an hour. Strain the chowder, without pressing or 
shaking ; put clams, etc., into a covered tureen ; return 
the liquor to the pot. Thicken with rolled crackers ; add 
a glass of wine, a tablespoonful of catsup ; boil up, and 
pour over the chowder. Pass sliced lemon with it. 

Fried Weak Fish. 

Clean, wash, and dry the fish. Lay in a broad pan or 
dish ; salt, and dredge with flour. Fry in hot lard or very 
nice dripping to a light brown. In serving, lay the fish 
side by side, the head of each to the tail of the one next 
him. Garnish with parsley. 

Braised Duck. 

Clean and wash the duck. Stuff with a dressing' of 
bread-crumbs seasoned with pepper and salt, a little 
onion and sage. Sew up the vent, and tie the neck to 
keep in the flavor. Fry the duck in a great spoonful of 
butter until lightly browned, turning it often. Add the 
butter used for frying to the gravy saved from yesterday ; 
thin with boiling water, and, having put the duck into a 
saucepan, strain this gravy over it. It should half cover - 
the fowl. Stew slowly forty-five minutes, or until tender, ' 
keeping the lid on all the while. Take up the duck, 
cover to keep it warm, strain^ the gravy, and if very oily, 
take off the top. Boil sharply ten minutes in an open 
saucepan; thicken with browned floury put back the 
duck into it, and set the saucepan, again covered, in boil- 
ing water for a quarter of an hour. Serve the gravy in a 
boat.

but not to boiling, stir in the pulped peas, and toss about 
with a silver fork or spoon until they are a smoking mass. 
Pile in a hot dish, with triangles of fried bread laid up 
around the base. 

Cauliflower i la CRiiME. 

Boil a fine cauliflower, tied up snugly in coarse tarla- 
tan, in hot water, a little salt. Drain and layin a deep 
dish, flower uppermost. Heat a cup of milk ; thicken 
with two tablespoonfuls of butter, cut into bits, and rolled 
in flour. Add pepper, salt, the beaten white of an egg,

fire, squeeze the juice of a lemon through a hair sieve 
into the sauce, and pour half into a boat, the rest over the 
cauliflower. 

Corn-Meal Pudding without Eggs.

Chicken Broth. 

Clean, wash, and truss, but do not stuff, a full-grown 
fowl. Set aside the giblets for another use. Bind the 
legs and wings of the fowl closely to its sides. Put into 
a pot with four quarts of water (cold), and cook gently 
until the liquor has fallen one-third. Then add a full cup 
of rice, soaked for one hour in a very little water, and boil 
half an hour more, or until the chicken is tender and the 
rice soft, but not broken to pieces. Take out the 
chicken. Wipe off the adhering grains of rice, wash over 
with butter, salt and pepper, and set, covered, upon a pot 
of boiling water to keep hot. Season the soup with pep- 
per and salt, and simmer ten minutes more. Then strain 
out the rice, and cover it to keep hot. Return the soup 
to the pot, stir in a cup of hot milk, a tablespoonful of 
corn-starch wet with cold water, and a handful of very 
finely minced parsley. Boil up, take from the fire, and 
pour by degrees upon two beaten eggs. Cover for three 
minutes ; then pour into the tureen. 

Pat6 of Salt Cod. 

I cup of cold salt cod, soaked all night in soft water, 
boiled in the morning, left to cool, then " picked " 
into boneless flakes. 

1 cup of oyster-liquor. 

2 even tablespoonfuls of rice flour, or corn starch. 

3 tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Chopped parsley and pepper. 
3 hard-boiled eggs, minced. 



THIRD W£EK—SATURDAY. 211 

Some rich paste. (See " French Puff Paste," page 352, 
No. I, Common Sense Series — General Re- 
ceipts.) 

Boil the oyster-Hquor, stir in the corn-starch wet up 
with cold milk. , When it thickens, add the butter and 
pepper ; next the parsley and fish. Heat almost to boil- 
ing, and stir in the chopped egg. Take from the fire, 
and cover, over a pot of boiling water, ten minutes. 

Make the shell by lining a profusely buttered cake- 
mould, or round pan with nearly straight sides, with a 
thick sheet of puff-paste, pricking it at the bottom to pre- 
vent too much puffing. Cut a round piece exactly the 
size of the top, for a cover, and bake separately. Bake 
both in a quick oven. Let them get almost cool, turn 
out the shell with the utmost care ; fill slowly with the 
prepared fish, that the sides may not give way ; fit on the 
top ; hold an inverted hot plate firmly upon it and re- 
verse the pat6 skilfully, leaving the closed side upper- 
most. It is easily done, if one is only fearless yet dex- 
terous. Eat hot. 

Boiled Chicken and Rice. 

Boil the giblets tender in a little salted water ; chop 
fine, and when the rice is strained from the soup, mix 
them well through it. Pile the rice, when you are ready 
to serve it, upon a meat dish ; lay the chicken upon the 
top.; pour a few spoonfuls of egg sauce over it, and send 
to table. 

Egg Sauce. 

One cup of the broth in which the chicken was boiled, 
heated ; thickened with a tablespoonful of butter rolled 
thickly in flour ; poured over two beaten eggs ; boiled 
one minute, with a tablespoonful of parsley stirred ip ; 
then seasoned and poured upon the pounded yolks of 
two boiled eggs placed in the bottom of a bowl. Stir up 
well, and it is ready. 

Mashed Turnips. 
Boil in salted water, until tender; mash and drain in 
a hot colander, working in butter, salt, and pepper. 
Mound up in a hot, deep dish, covered. 



212 MARCH.

8 fine oranges, peeled and sliced. 
\ grated cocoanut. 
\ cup of powdered sugar. 
Arrange slices of orange in a glass dish ; scatter grated 
cocoanut thickly over them ; sprinkle this lightly with 
sugar, and cover with another layer of orange. Fill the 
dish in this order, having a double quantity of cocoanut 
and sugar at top. Serve soon after it is prepared. 

CAFfi Au Lait and Sponge-Cake. 
To one pint strong made coffee, add the same quantity 
of boiling milk. The coffee should be first strained 
through muslin into the table-urn, then the milk poured 
in with it. Wrap the urn in a woollen cloth, if you have 
no " cozy," for five minutes before serving. Send around 
sponge-cake, home-ma:de or bought, with it.

\ cup of sago or barley. 

6 quarts of cold water. 

Sweet herbs. ; 

Pepper and salt. 
Slice the meat, crack the bones, chop the vegetables, 
and -put all on over the fire with the water. Boil slowly 
five or six hours ; strain ; pick out the meat as well as 
you can, and. set aside. Then, rub the vegetables 
through a colander, prior to straining all through your 
soup-sieve. Set aside half the stock for Monday. Do 
thus much on Saturday. Or, if you choose, do hot strain 
the soup at all until Sunday morning. It will be the. 
richer for cooling with meat, etc., in it. In either case, 
season before setting it away, or it may sour. Put Sun- 
day's stock back into the pot ; boil up and skim, before 
adding the half cup of pearl sago, previously soaked for 
two hours in a very little cold water. Simmer twenty 
minutes and pour out. 

Beef i la Mode de Rome. 

Cut a quarter of a pound of streaked salt pork, and the 
same quantity of lean beef into strips, and fi"y, with a sliced 
onion, in good dripping. Put them in the bottom of a pot 
and lay a rib roast of beef, rolled round, upon them. Add 
a pint of boiling water, cover, and cook ten minutes to 
the pound, turning the beef three times meanwhile. 
Transfer the meat to a dripping-pan, dredge the top with 
flour, then baste with its own gravy, once. Keep hot, 
without cooking, while you strain the gravy left in the pot, 
thicken it with browned flour (always after taking the fat 
from the top), season with pepper, and stir in a teaspoon- 
ful of sugar, a handful of Sultana raisins, picked and 
washed, and the same quantity of blanched almonds, cut_ 
into tiny strips. Boil gently three minutes, dish the beef,' 
and pour the sauce over it. 

Odd as this receipt may seem to an American house- 
wife, the result is extremely palatable, and a good change 
of fare at this season.

Work hominy, butter, and salt to a smooth paste ; beat 
in the eggs, finally the chopped meat, after peppering and 
salting it. Stir up in a farina-kettle until hot, and pour 
out to cool. When cold, make into long rolls with floured 
hands, flour each well by rolling upon a dish, and fry to a 
yellow-brown in sweet lard. Drain off the fat and pile 
upon a hot dish. 

Spinach. 

Boil in hot, salted water, twenty minutes, drain and 
press hard ; chop fine, and return to the saucepan with a

froth, and when the strained gelatine is quite cold, whip 
it into the whites, a spoonful at a time for half an hour, if 
you use the Dover egg-beater (at least one hour with any 
other). When all is white and stiff, pour into a wet mould, 
and set in a cold place. Make this on Saturday, and on 
Sunday dip the mould into hot water, and turn out into a 
glass dish. Make a custard of the milk, eggs, and the rest

\ cup fine bread-crumbs. 

Pepper, salt, and minced parsley. 
Chop the fish fine, rub to a paste with the butter. 
Beat the bread-crumbs up with the eggs and seasoning ; 
work all together ; put into a buttered mould, with a tight 
top, and boil one hour. Dip in cold water ; turn it out 
upon a hot dish. Have ready a cupfiil of drawn butter 
with a raw egg beaten into it, and pour over the pudding. 

Swiss Turnovers. 

Mince the cold mutton left from yesterday. Put half a 
cupful of hot water into a saucepan ; stir in a great spoon- 
ful of butter, cut up in flour ; season with pepper, salt, 
and tomato catsup. Pour over a beaten egg, mix well, 
and, returning to the saucepan, add the mince, well sea- 
soned with pepper, salt, a little grated lemon-peel and 
nutmeg. Stir up until very hot, but not boiling. Set by 
to keep hot while you make a batter of one pint of flour, 
four eggs, a little salt, and a quarter spoonful of soda, dis- 
solved in vinegar, and about four cups of milk — enough 
for thin batter. Beat very light. Put a spoonful of lard 
(a small one) into a hot frying-pan, run it over the bottom, 
turn in a half cupful of batter, and fry quickly. Invert 
the pan upon a hot_ plate, and this, in turn, upon another, 
to have the browned side of the pancake downward ; 
cover the lighter side with the mince ; fold up neatly and 
lay upon a hot dish in the open oven to keep warm, 
while you fry and spread the rest. 

They are very nice.

heaping spoonful of butter, for one minute, then put in 
the potatoes. Stir briskly to keep them from browning ; 
cook until very hot ; add a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley ; stir a minute longer ; turn all into a heated col- 
ander ; shake hard to get rid of the grease, and serve hot 
in a vegetable-dish. 

Queen's Toast.

ter, taking off all the crust. Fry in sweet lard to a light 
brown. Dip each round quickly into boiling, water to re- 
move the fat. Sprinkle thickly on both sides with a mix- 
ture of powdered sugar and nutmeg, and pile upon a hot 
plate. You may dispense with sauce if you will heat a 
glass of wine, and put a teaspoonful, or less, upon each

a little salt, poured over them. Cover very securely with 
another pan of the same size- — inverted — and cook an 
hour and a half if the fowls are of fair size. Baste at 
least six times ; twice with butter in which has been 
mixed a little pepper ; three times, copiously, with their

of milk. Simmer gently, still in the inner kettle, until the 
rice is again dry, and quite tender. Shake up anew, and 
add another pint of milk. When this is hot, put in the 
raisins, dredged with flour ; cover the saucepan and cook 
twenty minutes. Turn into a bowl ; put with it the but-

absorbed all the milk, drain it again. Pile it around the 
inner edge of a flat dish ; smooth it neatly, rounding the 
top, into a sort of fence ; wash over carefully with the 
beaten yolks of two eggs, and set it in the oven until firm.

Clear Soup. 
Take the grease from the soup-jelly you will find in the 
crock into which the stock was poured yesterday. Take 
it up by thd ladleful, leaving the meat and sediment at the 
bottom, and put on to heat in a soup-kettle. When it 
boils, stir in the beaten white of an egg ; take off the scum 
as fast as it rises, and when quite clear add two teaspoonfuls 
of Coxe's gelatine, previously soaked in cold water. Add, 
meanwhile, a little boiling water to the sediment and meat 
dice in the pot ; strain off the liquid ; pick out the bits of 
meat, and see that they are clean. Drop into the soup at 



228 APRIL. 

the same time that you add fejLir tablespoonfuls of colored 
water, made by burning a tablespoonful or two of sugar in a 
tin cup, pouring a httle boiling water upon it, and stirring 
until you get a clear brown liquor. After these go in, 
do not let your soup really boil, but simrner a few minutes 
to throw up and remove any remaining scum. Pass sliced 
lemon with the soup. 

Fricasseed Chickens — White. 
Clean, ipash, and joint the fowls. Lay in cold salt and 
water for one hour. Put them into a pot, with half a pound 
of salt pork cut into strips, and cold water enough to cover 
them. Cover closely, and heat very slowly to a gentle 
boil. The excellence of the fricassee depends mainly upon, 
care in this respect. If the foWls are full-grown and rea- 
sonably tender, stew more than one hour after they begin 
to boil. When done add half a chopped onion, parsley 
and pepper. Cover again for ten minutes. Stir up two 
tablespoonfuls of flour in cold water, then into a cup of 
hot milk, and this, in turn, into two beaten eggs. Then 
put in a great spoonful of butter, and pour all into the 
saucepan ; mix well, boil fairly, and, having arranged the 
chickens upon a hot dish, pour the gravy over them. 

Buttered Parsnips. 

Boil tender and scrape. Slice lengthwise. Put three 
tablespoonfuls of butter into a saucepan with pepper, salt 
and a little chopped parsley. When it heats, put in the 
parsnips, and shake and turn until the mixture boils. Lay 
the parsnips in order upon a hot dish, and pour the but- 
ter over them. 

Savory Potatoes. 

Pare and cut into squares some ra,w potatoes. Lay 
in cold water half an hour, put into a saucepan, cover with 
boiling water, slightly salted, and stew half an hour, not so 
fast as to break them. Then throw off the water and add 
a cupful of sauce made from the gravy of Friday's chick- 
ens, thinned with a little hot water, and strained ; seasoned 
to taste, and again thickened with a tablespoonful of butter 
rolled in flour. Simmer all for ten minutes, and turn into 
a deep dish. 



FIRST W^EK— MONDAY. 229 

Lettuce Sal|p — Plain. 
Wash the lettuce ; pull leaf from leaf, and pile over a 
lump of ice in a salad-bowl. Pass the oil and vinegar, 
salt, pepper, and powdered sugar to each person, with the 
lettuce, that he may season for himself. 

Pie-Plant (April) Fool. 

I pint of stewed pie plant, rubbed through a colander. 

I tablespoonful of butter. 

I cup of sugar. 

Yolks of four eggs. 

Miringue of the whites. 
, 3 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Juice of half a lemon. 

Put the strained pie-plant into a saucepan ; set it in 
boiling water, and, when hot, beat in the butter, sugar, and 
beaten yolks. Stir two minutes, and turn out to cool. 
This can be done on Saturday. On Sunday, a few min- 
utes' whirl of your egg-beater will give you the meringue. 
Beat in the powdered sugar with a few more, and when 
you have poured the stewed fruit (or vegetable) into a 
glass bowl, pile the meringue (the "fool" ?) on the top. 

Coffee and Cake 
Can be handed with, or after the sweets.

fat, salt pork, drawn quite through, so as to project on both 
sides. "Put into a saucepan, sprinkle with minced onion, 
pepper, and parsley, and barely cover with weak broth, 
The gravy from yesterday's chickens will do, or any other 
you may chance to have. Put on the saucepan lid, set it 
where it will not boil under an hour, and think no more 
about it until the time is up. Then increase the heat and 
simmer half an hour, or until tender. Take up the chops 
and keep hot. Thicken the gravy with browned flour ; 
add the juice of a lemon, a great spoonful of mushroom 
catsup, a glass of sherry, and boil one minute. Put back

1 quart of prepared ilour. 
\ lb. powdered suet. 

1 cup of ice-water. 

2 lbs. good steak without bone. 
Pepper and salt. 

I tablespoonful of tomato catsup. 

Rub the suet into the flour, salt slighriy, and make, with 
' the water, into a paste just soft enough to roll out. Roll 
into a sheet nearly half an inch thick. Butter well . a 
rofind bottomed pudding mould ; line with the paste, and 
leave in a cold place while you cut the steak into small 
squares, seasoning with pepper, salt, and catsup. Fiil the 
paste-lined mould (or bowl) with this. Cut a piece of 
paste for the top. Cover with this, pinching the two 
sheets of paste tightly together at the, edges. Let an 
assistant hold up the bowl while you cover with a stout 
pudding-cloth and tie tightly under the bottom, not strain- 
ing the cloth so strongly over the top as to hinder tlie 
paste from swelling. (Flour the cloth before tying it ' 
over the bowl.) Plunge into a gallon of boiling water, 
and keep it at a fast boil for. two hours, filling up from the 
tea-kettle when the water sinks. Turn the bowl bottom 
upAvard and dip in cold water ; untie the cloth, invert a 
hot dish upon the mould, and turn over carefully, to get 
the pudding but without breaking. This is a favorite 
English dish. 

Stewed Potatoes, 
Old potatoes, by this time, need a little management to 
make them accepta6le at a season when appetites crave 
fresh vegetables. This is a good way to cook them. 
Pare very thin, and leave in cold water one hour. Put 
on to cook in cold water, bringing it soon . to a boil. 



FIRST WEEK—TUESDAY. 233 

When a fork will run easilyflfca the largest, strain off the

Queen of Puddings. 



"Red Pottage.'' 

To the bean-stock set by on yesterday add a can of red 
tomatoes, cut small, and two lumps of sugar, and simmer, 
set in boiling water for fear of burning, until they are one 
mass of pulp. Strain through a colander, add seasoning, 
and stir in a generous glass of claret which was poured, 
two hours before, upon a sliced, deep-colored beei, warm 
from the boil. Strain the juice from the beet by squeez- 
ing in a cloth. Put a double-handful of fried bread into 
a tureen, and pour the soup upon it. 

This, if not " that same red pottage " for which poor 
hungry Esau — who certainly came honestly, by hereditary 
right, by his love of "good eating" — bartered his birth- 
right, is yet very pretty and savory. 

Boiled Cod with Caper Sauce. 

Sew the iish up neatly in a thin cloth and cook in boil- 
ing water, fifteen minutes to the pound. Unwrap, lay 
upon a hot dish, and po«r over it the following sauce : 

Put a cupful of boiling water into a saucepan, and stir 
in two tablespoonfuls of butter, cut up in a heaping tea- 
spoonful of flour. Beat in, when thick, the whipped yolk 
of an egg, the juice of a lemon, and twenty-four capers. 
Stir up well, cook half a minute, and take from the fire.

Scalloped Sjiicken. 

Clean, wash, and cut an ola fowl to pieces. Put into a 
pot with four quarts of cold water and cook very slowly 
until tender. Take it out, salt and pepper the broth, and 
put by for to-morrow's soup, reserving one cupful for your 
gravy. 

Let the chicken cool, and cut— cleanly — into pieces an 
inch long by one-fourth that width. Put the gravy, well- 
seasoned, over the fire, thicken with a tablespoonful of 
butter, cut up and rolled in flour ; stir in the chicken, and 
just before it boils, take from the fire, and beat in two 
whisked eggs, with a little finely minced parsley. Strew 
the bottom of a bake-dish with crumbs ; pour in the 
chicken ; cover with a deeper coating of bread-crumbs ; 
stick bits of butter over this, and bake, covered, until bub- 
bling hot ; then brown delicately.

naming, in cold water and cook soft. Rub through a 
fine colander. While hot, stir in a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, and season with pepper and salt. When quite cold, 
beat in two eggs, a cupful of milk, and half a cupful of 
flour in which has been sifted — twice — a quarter teaspoon- 
ful of soda and twice as much cream-of-tartar. Beat hard 
and long, and fry as you would griddle-cakes.

Draw to the oven door, spread quickly with the jelly, and 
this with a miringue of the whites and half a cup of sugar. 
Shut the oven and bake quickly until the mhingue begins

Chicken Soup. 

Take the fat from the top of the liquor in which your 
chicken was boiled yesterday, and put on the soup Jo 
heat. Meanwhile, boil half a cupful of rice tender in a 
pint of salted milk, and when the rice is soft, stir in a 
tablespoonful of butter worked up in flour to prevent oil- 
ing. When the soup boils up clear, skim and add the 
rice and milk, with two tablespoonfuls of minced parsley. 
Pepper and salt to taste ; simmer ten minutes. Chop up 
three hard-boiled eggs fine ; put into the tureen and pour 
the soup upon them.

2 cupfuls of cold boiled fish (yesterday's cod). 

2 heads of lettuce. 

Rub the yolks smooth with the oil, add sugar, salt, pep- 
per, and mustard, and, when all are mixed, the vinegar, 
a little at a time. Set by, covered, while you cut — not 
chop — the fish into strips an inch long, and shred die let- 
tuce. Mix these in a bowl. Whip the frothed white of 
egg into the dressing, and pour upon the salad. Stir up 
with a silver fork and put into a glass dish. Garnish with 
rings of the whites of boiled eggs. 

Veal Chops with Tomato Sauce. 
Trim and flatten the chops. Dip in raw egg, then in 
cracker dust, and fry, rather slowly, in lard or dripping. 
Open a can of tomatoes, and drain off the liquor. Salt 
the rest of the tomatoes and reserve for Friday's soup. 
Put the liquor into a saucepan with a. sliced onion, and 
stew ten minutes. Strain out the onion, return the juice 
to the fire ; thicken with a great spoonful of butter, 
worked up in a teaspoonful of corn-starch ; pepper and 
salt. Boil up sharply, and when you have laid the chops 
upon a dish, pour the sauce over them. 

Macaroni with Eggs. 
Break half a pound of macaroni into short bits ; cook 
tender in boiling, salted water. Drain well ; put into a 
deep dish and pour over it a cupful of drawn butter in 
which have been stirred two bea.ten eggs, and two table- 
spoonfuls of grated cheese, with salt and pepper. Loosen 
the macaroni to allow the sauce to penetrate the mass. 
Pass more grated cheese with it. 

Potato Strips. 
Pare, cut in long, even strips ; lay in (*old water for 
one hour ; dry by spreading them upon a towel and press- 
ing another upon them. Fry to a light brown in salted lard. 
Shake off the fat in a hot colander. Line a deep dish 
with a napkin and put in the strips. They should not 
be crowded in frying, but each shoidd be distinct and free 
from the rest. 



238 APRIL. 

Jelly-Cake Fritters. 

Cut stale sponge or very plain cup cake into rounds 
with a cake-cutter. Fry to a nice brown in sweet lard.

into the tureen. Stir the soup into it by degrees, and 
serve. Pass Boston crackers — split and buttered — with it. 

Scallopi;d Oysters. 
Butter a pudding-dish, and strew the bottom with 
rolled cracker. Wet this with oyster-liquor and milk, 
slightly warmed. Then lay on oysters, set closely to- 
gether. Sprinkle with pepper, salt, and bits of butter, 
with a few drops of lemon-juice. Another stratum of 
moistened crumbs, and so on, until the dish is full. Let 
the top layer be of crumbs, with butter dots here and

4 sweetbreads. 

I cup of gravy (yesterday's broth will do). 

I onion. 

■J- cup butter.

Pepper and salt. 
Boil the sweetbreads quickly — ten minutes are enough 
—blanch by throwing them into cold water, then leaving 
them to cool. Slice them lengthwise. Slice, also, the 
onion and mushrooms, and fry brown in half the butter. 
Strain them out, return the fat to the pan, with the rest 
of the butter. Heat, and fry the sweetbreads. When 
the latter are done, put all into a tin pail, with a tight 
top ; add the gravy ; set, covered, in boiling' water, and 
stew gently, at the side of the range, half an hour. 
Arrange the sweetbreads upon a hot dish ; thicken the 
gravy with browned flour, and pour over them. Garnish

and stir until dissolved. Let it stand a few minutes, and 
strain through muslin over the beaten yolks and sugar. 
Put over the fire and stir five minutes, or until you can 
feel it thiiskening. Stir up well when nearly cold, flavor, 
and let it alone until it congeals around the edges of the 
bowl into which you have poured it ; then stir again, and 
put into a wet mould. Set upon ice, or in cold water 
until firm. Turn it, when you are ready for it, into a 
glass bowl. Have ready a miringue made by whipping 
the whites stiff with three tablespoonfuls of powdered

Vermicelli Soup. 
Glazed Ham. Spinach a la Parisienne. 

Chow-chow. Baked Potatoes. 



Rhubar'o Tart. 



Vermicelli Soup. 

4 lbs. knuckle of veal. 

2 lbs. of coarse, lean beef. 

2 slices of corned ham, or some bones of salt pork. 



FIRST WEEK—SATURDAY. 241 

2 onions. 

Thyme and parsley. 

■J lb. vermicelli. 

Pepper and salt. 

6 quarts of water. 

Crack the bones into splinters ; cut the meat into 
strips; slice the onions and chop the herbs. Put on in 
six quarts of water, and cook slowly five hours. Strain, 
pressing meat, etc., hard in the colander. There should 
be about four quarts of soup. Set aside half, when you 
have salted it, for Sunday. Return the rest to the clean 
kettle, season and skim. The vermicelli should have 
been broken small, and boiled in a little hot, salted water, 
three minutes. Strain, without squeezing ; butter and 
pepper ; stir into the soup ; simmer very gently five min- 
utes, and pour out. 

Glazed Ham. 
Wash a fine corned — not smoked — ham ; soak all night 
in cold water, and boil about eighteen minutes to the pound. 
There should be plenty of water in the pot, cold at first, 
and brought gradually to a boil. Skim well from time to 
time. Let it get cold in the water in which it was boiled, 
if you can spare the time. We always boil a ham the day 
before it is to be eaten. Take it out ; remove the skin 
carefully, and put the latter back into the cold liquor 
when you have skimmed all the fat — which makes excel- 
lent dripping — from the surface of the liquid. Press soft 
paper on the top of the ham, to take off the clinging drops 
of grease. Brush all over with beaten egg. Work a cup 
(Si rolled cracker into a paste with warm milk, butter, pep- 
per, salt, and a beaten egg. Coat the ham thickly with 
this, and set to brown in a moderate oven. Twist frilled 
paper around the knuckle, and garnish with cresses. 

Spinach i la Parisienne. 
Pick ofif the leaves from the stalks ; put on in boiling 
water, a little salt, and cook twenty minutes. Drain hard 
and dry, chop fine, return to the fire with a good piece of 
butter, a teaspoonful of sugar, a Utile nutmeg, pepper and 
salt, and stir two minutes. Then, beat in two or three 



242 APRIL. 

tablespoonfuls of cream, or rich milk, and whip as you 
would a custard. It should be smooth to taste and sight. 
Boil up — barely — and dish. 

Chow-chow 
" Goes well," as the French say, with ham. 

Baked Potatoes. 
Parboil, peel, and lay in a dripping-pan, with a bit of 
butter upon each. As they brown, put on each a tea- 
spoonful of warm milk mixed with butter, salt, and pepper. 
They should be of a light brown. Butter again just before 
you dish them. 

Rhubarb Tart. 

Scrape the stalks, cut into small bits, and stew in a very 
little water. When tender, take from the fire and sweeten. 
Have ready some open shells of pastry, freshly baked. 
Fill with the fruit, and sift sugar on top. Eat warm or 
cold — never hot. Make more paste than you need, and 
keep — raw — in a cold place. 



Pea and Rice Soup. 

Fillet of Veal with Ham. Potato Balls. 

Stuffed Cabbage. French Beans. 



Charlotte Cachee. 
Bird's Nest in Jelly. 



Pea and Rice Soup. 
Open a can of green peas, and turn them into a bowl 
for an hour. Boil half a cup of rice soft in a cup of milk. 
Skim the stock made yesterday, and heat to a boil before 
adding the peas (drained) and the rice, which should have 
absorbed all the milk. Stew slowly half an hour ; add 
what seasoning you like, and stir in a tablespoonful of 
butter cut up in flour. Simmer five minutes and poiir out. 



SECOND WEEK—SUNDAY. 243 

Fillet of Veal with Ham. 
Have the fillet rolled and skewered by your butcher. 
Stuff a good force-meat of crumbs and minced fat ham be- 
tween the folds of meat, and lay sliced ham over the top 
and sides, binding it in place with packthread. Put into 
a dripping-pan with a cup of boiling water, and roast 
twelve minutes for each pound. Baste very often. Half 
an hour before you take it up, remove the ham, and lay 
on one side of the pan ; dredge the meat with flour and 
baste abundantly and frequentfy until well browned. Dish 
with the ham cut into strips and laid next the edge of the 
dish — the potato balls close to the meat. Send around 
sweet pickles with it. Strain the gravy, thicken with 
browned flour, add pepper and a tablespoonful of tomato 
catsup ; boil up and pour into a boat. 

Potato Balls. 
To one cup of mashed potato add a beaten egg, pep- 
per, and salt, and work smooth. Make into balls ; roll 
them in flour. When the veal is half done, skim off the 
fat from the gravy, lay the balls in the pan, basting, now 
and then, and turning until they are browned all over.- 
Drain well, and lay about the dished veal. 

Stuffed Cabbacje. 
Boil a large, firm cabbage, whole, on Saturday, tying 
coarse net over it to keep it in shape, Do not remove the 
net until next day. Then, bind a broad strip of muslin 
about it that it may not crack in the stufliing. Extract 
the stalk with a thin, sharp knife. Without making a wide 
external aperture, " dig out " the heart, until you have 
room for nearly a cupful of force-meat. Chop the bits you 
have taken out, mix with cooked sausage-meat, a very little 
onion, pepper, salt, a pinch of thyme and bread-crumbs. 
Stuff the cabbage with this, remove the band, tie up firmly 
again in a net bag, and put it into a pot, covering with the 
liquor in which your ham was boiled yesterday, having 
first again skimmed the latter. Stew gently one hour. 
Take out the cabbage, unbind, with care, and pour a cup 
of drawn butter over it. Strain the useful " pot liquor," 
and put away heedfully. 



244 APRIL. 

Fkench Beans. 

Cut into short lengths, when you have poured off the 
can liquor ; cook half an hour in boiling water, salted. 
Drain well, stir up with a tablespoonful of butter, with 
pepper and salt to taste. 

Charlotte Cach^e. 
I thick loaf of sponge or plain cup cake. 
2 kinds of fruit-jelly, tart and sweet. 
Whites of 5 eggs. 
I heaping cup of powdered sugar. 
Juice of I lemon. 
Cut the cake into horizontal slices of uniform width, 
Spread each with jelly — first, the tart, then the sweet, and 
fit into their former places. Ice thickly with a frosting 
made of the whites, sugar, and lemon-juice. Set in a 
sunny window, or slow oven, to harden. The former is 
the better plan. 

Bird's Nest in Jelly, 
I quart of wine jelly — not too thin. 
3 cups of white blanc-mange. 
9 empty egg-shells. • 

Rind of 2 oranges cut into strips and stewed in water, 
until tender, then in syrup until clear, or, if you have 
it, use preserved orange-peel. 
Empty the eggs carefully through a hole in the small 
end ; wash them out with cold water, and while wet inside 
set firmly in a pan of bran or meal, to keep them steadily 
upright. Fill them with blaric mange. Next morning, fill 
a glass dish two-thirds full with clear jelly, reserving a 
large cupful. So soon as the jelly is firm enough to bear 
their weight, break the shells, with care, from the blanc- 
mange eggs, and pile them upon the jelly. Lay the 
'■' straw " — i. e., the orange-peel — over and about them ; 
pour the rest of the half-congealed jelly over all, and set 
in a very cold place. 

A beautiful variation of this dessert can be made for Eas- 
ter Sunday, by coloring part of the blanc-mange brown with 
chocolate, part pink with currant jelly or cranberry juice, 
part yellow with yolk of egg, and leaving'the rest white. 



SECOND WEEK-MONDAY. 245

stir in two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch, wet in a half cup 
of milk. Take out a pint of the soup, and pour slowly, 
stirring well, upon four beaten eggs. Return to the soup, 
with a handful of very finely minced parsley. Stir one 
minute, without letting it boil, and pour upon half a dozen 
split Boston crackers, lining the tureen. 

Veal Pat^s. 

Chop up the meat left from Sunday's ftUet — reserving 
some for salad — also the crisped ham. Season well, 
warm up the gravy, when you have removed the fat ; mix 
a little oyster liquor with it, and stir in the mince. Heat 
almost to boiling, and set by, covered, where it will keep 
warm. Line /a/e-pans with the paste reserved for this 
purpose from Saturday. If kept in the refrigerator or 
cool cellar, it will be perfectly good. Bake these 
" shells," buttering the tins. well ; slip out while hot ; ar- 
range on a warm dish ; fill with the mince, sprinkling the 
top of each with finis, dry crumbs ; set upon the upper 
grating of your oven for a minute or so, and send to 
table. 

, Creamed Parsnips.

lettuce, and chop two boiled eggs — not too finely. Mix 
these together in a bowl. Prepare a dressing thus : Beat 
the yolks of two eggs (add the whites to the soup) ; salt 
hghtly, and beat in, a few drops at a time, four table- 
spoonfuls of oil ; then, as gradually, three teaspoonfuls of 
best vinegar, and half a teaspoonful of celery essence —

as cream. Pour over the meat and lettuce, toss up with 
a silver fork, and transfer to a glass dish.

pepper and salt, and turn into a hot colander. Shake 
and toss for a moment, and pour into a deep dish. 

Chicken Salad. 
Cut the meat from the "carcasses" of yesterday's 
chickens. If you have but a little it may be worth while 
to give John a piquant side-dish. Add an equal quan- 
tity of shred lettuce, when you have cut your chicken into 
narrow strips, two inches long. Mix in a bowl ; prepare 
a dressing according to the receipt given on Monday ;

upon a hot water dish to keep hot. Cut some potatoes 
into small balls. There is a little instrument for this pur- 
pose, like a rounded gouge, which turns them out rapidly 
and neatly. A small iron spoon will give you oval balls. 
Or, if you find it easier, cut the potatoes into equal cubes ; 
lay in cold water half an hour, then cook fifteen minutes 
in boiling watgr. Drain and dry, and after taking your fish 
from the butter, strain the latter, put in the potatoes, and 
shake over a hot fire until they begin to brown. Drain,

dexterous motion of the turner ; invert a hot dish upon 
the pan ; upset the latter, and dish the omelette. Have

cheese, lastly, the flour. Work all to a cream ; spread 
thickly upon the bread, and brown lightly.

flour. 
2 teaspoonfuls vanilla, or other extract. (If possible 
get your flavoring extracts from Colgate & Co., 53 
AND ss John Street, New York. They are 
good from first to last, which is more than I can

Beat the yolks. Add the crumbs soaked in a pint of 
the milk. Stir in the rice-flour, wet in cold milk; the re-

FIRST WEEK—SUNDAY. 287 



MAY. 
iTirst tDcek. JSunbag. 



Clear Soup. 

Roast Lamb. Green Peas. 

Mint Sauce. Asparagus on Toast. 

Potato Kggs. 



Rice and Tapioca Pudding. 



Clear Soup. 

Take all the fat from the stock reserved for to-day, and 
pour the liquid carefully off from the meat and bones, 
not disturbing the sediment in the bottom. {Mem. 
Take out a little of the meat, beef, and ham, for a purpose 
of which we shall speak presently — add boiling water — 
about a quart — to the rest of the residuum with more sea- 
soning, and the remains of your okra and tomato soup. 
Stew gently half an hour, and set aside in a cool place for 
to-morrow. The growing heat of the weather makes this 
a necessary precaution.) Put then the clear stock upon 
the fire with a whole onion, and simmer thirty minutes. 
Skim well, take out the onion, and stir in two tablespoon- 
fuls of gelatine previously soaked one hour in cold water, 
with a tablespoonful (scant) of Harvey's sauce. Cook 
five minutes and pour out. 

Roast Lamb. 

Lay in the dripping-pan ; dash a cupful of boiling water 
over it and roast in a good oven, allowing about ten min- 
utes — not more — to the pound. Baste often and freely, 
and after half an hour, cover with a sheet of thick paper. 
Five minutes before taking it up, remove this, dredge with 
flour, and as this browns, bring to a froth with butter. 
Do not send the gravy to table if you use mint sauce. 



288 MA Y. 

Mint Sauce. 

2 tablespoonfuls green mint, chopped very fine. 
1 tablespoonful white sugar. 
About half a cupful best cider vinegar. 
Put sugar and vinegar into a sauce-boat and stir in the 
mint. Let it stand fifteen minutes before serving. 

Green Peas. 

I have purposely avoided too early an introduction of 
green vegetables and other spring dainties, through fear 
that the high prices demanded for them might make this 
part of my work useless for housekeepers of moderate 
means. By the first of May, however, even our Northern 
markets should be well supplied at reasonable rates with 
many delightful esculents which are, as yet, brought only 
from the South. 

Shell the peas and wash well in cold water. Cook in 
boiling water— salted — for twenty-five minutes. A lump 
of sugar will be an addition, and a pleasant one, to mar- 
ket peas. Drain well, stir in "a great lump of butter, and 
pepper and salt. Serve hot. 

Asparagus upon Toast. 

Cut the stalks of equal length, rejecting the woody por- 
tions and scraping the whiter parts retained. Tie in a 
bunch with soft tape, and cook about thirty minutes, if of 
fair size. Have ready six or eight slices of cruatless 
bread, nicely toasted. Dip in the asparagus-liquor, butter 
well and lay upon a very hot dish. Drain the asparagus, 
untie, and arrange upon the toast, peppering and butter- 
ing to taste. 

Potato Eggs. 

2 cups mashed potato. 
^ cup minced meat. 
2 beaten eggs. 

2 tablespoonfuls hot milk. 

I tablespoonful melted butter. 

3 tablespoonfuls gravy. 
Pepper, salt, and dripping. 



FIRST WEEK— MONDAY. 289 

Work the potato smooth with butter, milk, gravy, and 
beaten eggs. Put into a saucepan, and stir over the fire 
until smoking hot. Stir in the meat; let it get cool 
enough to handle. Flour your hands and make the mix- 
ture into egg-shaped balls. Roll in flour and fry in hot 
dripping. Pile upon a hot dish. 

Rice and Tapioca Pudding. 

\ cup rice. 

\ cup tapioca. 

f cup sugar. 

3 pints of milk. 

Cinnamon to taste. 
Soak the tapioca three hours in half of the milk. Wash 
the rice in three waters and soak in the rest of the milk 
the same length of time. Put them together, stir in the 
sugar by degrees, until all is melted ; season with cinna- 
mon and a pinch of salt ; mix up well, and bake in a slow 
oven two hours. Make it on Saturday, and eat cold on 
Sunday with sugar and cream. 



Yesterday's Soup. 

Cold Lamb. Savory Macaroni. 

Sea Kale. Potato Salad. 



Coffee and Sister Mag's Cake. 



Yesterday's Soup. 

Strain the stock heated up on Sunday with the remains 
of Saturday's soup. Boil four tablespoonfuls of rice in a 
little water until soft. Add, with the water, to the soup, 
with additional seasoning, if necessary, and heat almost to 
a boil. If it has been kept in a cool place you will find it 
very good. Never throw away a spoonful of any soup. 
It will come into use if you can keep it from spoiling.

290 MAY. 

Cold Lamb. 

Trim neatly, garnish with curled parsley, and pass mixed 
pickles with it. Few methods of preparing lamb for the 
table by wanning over can compare with the easier way 
of setting it on cold, if it has been nicely roasted at first. 

Savory Macaroni. 

To a cup of yesterday's soup add another of boiling 
water. Let them boil once ; skim and put in half a pound 
of macaroni broken into inch lengths. While it is cook- 
ing tender, boil one sweetbread .fifteen minutes ; throw 
into cold water and let it cool, then cut into small dice. 
When the macaroni is tender, but not broken, mix with 
it a custard made of two eggs, one large cup of milk, and 
a little salt. Stir into the macaroni a very little minced 
onion, pepper to taste ; add the chopped sweetbread ; 
put into a greased mould, with a cover ; put this into a 
dripping-pan full of boiling water and cook in a good oven 
a little over one hour. Turn out upon a hot dish, and 
send around grated" cheese with it. 

Sea-Kale. 

Pick over carefully, tie up in bunches, and lay for half 
an hour in cold water. Put into salted boiling water and 
cook twenty-five minutes. Put buttered toast in the 
bottom of a d,eep dish ; clip the threads binding the kale, 
and lay.it upon the toast. Pepper, and pour a cupful of 
drawn butter over it. 

Potato Salad. 

Slice cold boiled potatoes, and put a layer in a salad 
dish. Cover with thin slices of hard boiled egg, and strew 
with bits of pickled onion. When the dish is full pour 
over them a dressing made in the proportion of one table- 
spoonful of vinegar to three of salad oil ; one spoonful of 
salt to half as much pepper, and the same quantity of made 
mustard. Beat up well before pouring over the salad. 
Let all stand ten minutes — or more — ^before serving. 



FIRST WEEK— TUESDAY. 29 1

the fat. Skim and season. When hot again put in the 
tapioca and stir until it melts. Simmer half an hour, 
add the celery essence and serve. 

Baked Beefsteak. 

Take the bone from a large sirloin steak ; flatten it 
with the side of a hatchet, wash, over the upper side with 



292 MAK. 

a beaten egg and spread thickly with a force-meat of 
crumbs, minced ham, and any other cold meat you may 
have, a teaspoonful of minced onion, a pinch of grated 
lemon peel, with pepper and salt, a beaten egg and three 
tablespoonfuls of cream or milk. Work these into a 
paste before spreading. Roll the steak upon them, bind- 
ing closely with soft pack-thread. Have ready some drip- 
ping in a frying-pan, and cook the steak five minutes in 
this, turning as it browns. Now lay it in a dripping-pan 
with a cupful of boiling water ; cover and bake forty min- 
utes, basting and turning often. When done, remove 
the strings ; lay the beef upon a hot dish ; thicken the 
gravy with browned flour, boil up and pour half over it 
— the rest into a boat. 

Young Onions Stewed. 

Skin, wash well, and cook in boiling water, salted, until 
half-done — say fifteen minutes. Then, throw off nearly 
all the water and replenish with scalding milk. Cook 
tender in this, stir in pepper, salt, a great spoonful of 
butter cut up in a teaspoonful of flour. Simmer three 
minutes, and pour out. 

Potatoes Baked with Steak. 

Parboil, skin, and quarter some large potatoes. About 
ten minutes before you take up your steak, lay the pota- 
toes around it in the pan, and brown in the hot gravy. 
Serve in the dish with the meat, laid on the outer edge. 

Lettuce Salad. 

Pull out the hearts and blanched leaves, 'heap them 
within a salad bowl ; strew with powdered sugar, and 
pour over them a dressing made according to directions 
given yesterday. Toss up well with a silver fork. 

Oatmeal Pudding with Cream. 

I quart of boiling milk. 

4 tablespoonfuls best Irish oatmeal. 

4 tablespoonfuls of flour. 

I teaspoonful of salt. 



FIRST WEEK— WEDNESDAY. 293 

Wet up flour, oatmeal, and salt, with cold milk and stir 
into the hot, which must be in a farina-kettle. Stir twenty 
minutes well from the bottom, and let it stand ten min- 
utes in the tjoiling water without cooking before pouring 
into an uncovered deep dish. Eat with cream and sugar. 



Hot Pot. 
Stewed Breast of Veal with Mushrooms. 

Rhubarb Sauce. Spinach a la Reine.

Bunch of sweet herbs. 

I onion. 

I bunch of asparagus — the green tops only. 

8 Boston crackers. 

Cayenne pepper. 

Butter for crackers. 

6 quarts of water. 

Juice' of I lemon. 
Boil beef, herbs and onion together in the water — cook- 
ing slowly — three hours. Cool, to throw up the fat, and 
skim well. Put away half of the liquor with the meat, 
well-seasoned, for another day. Strain the remainder 
back into the pot ; add the meat of two boiled crabs 
nicely cut — not chopped — up, and the pork, also boiled 
and cut into dice ; the asparagus-tops, with plenty of sea- 
soning. Stew for half an hour, gently. Have ready in 
your tureen eight Boston crackers split, laid for five min- 
utes in boiling water, then drained and buttered. Pour 



294 MA Y. 

the soup over these, cover, and serve, having added the 
lemon-juice at the last. Send sliced lemon around with it. 

Stewed Breast of Veal with Mushroom Sauce. 

Trim neatly; take out the largest bone, and fill the 
cavity with a good force-meat. Skewer into a compact 
shape. Lay in a frying-pan with three tablespoonfuls of 
butter, and brown on both sides. Line the bottom of a 
large saucepan with slices of pork, pepper them, and lay 
in the veal. Cover tightly, and heat very slowly, one 
hour, without opening the pot. Then turn the meat, 
add half a can of chopped mushrooms, and half a Ber- 
muda onion, sliced, with a cup of boiling water. Cover 
again, and cook for another hour — never fast. The meat 
should be cooked almost wholly in its own steam. Turn 
again, and simmer fifteen minutes. Take up the meat, 
thicken the gravy with browned flour, wet with cold water, 
adding a little boiling water, if needful ; boil up, and pour 
over the veal. If these directions be exactly followed, this 
dish will be excellent. 

Spinach 1 la Reine. 

Wash well, pick ofif the leaves, and cook them twenty 
minutes in salted, boiling water. Drain and press out 
all the water ; chop very fine. Return to the saucepan 
with a good lump of butter, pepper, salt, a pinch of mace, 
a teaspoonful of sugar, and three spoonfuls — large ones — - 
of good gravy. Stir, beat, and toss, until nearly dry. 
Fill hot, wet egg-cups with the mixture, and turn out 
upon a heated, flat dish. Lay a slice of egg upon each. 

Rhubarb (or Pie-plant) Sauce.

done. 

Burnt Custard. 

I quart of milk. 

5 eggs. 

3 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Nutmeg and flavoring extract to taste. 
Scald the milk, but not to boiling ; beat eggs light, with 
the sugar, and pour upon them the hot milk. Mix well, 
and bake in a well-buttered dish. Turn out when cold ; 
strew very thickly with white sugar. Set the plate con- 
taining the custard upon the upper grating of a hot oven. 
The sugar will melt, and run in brown streams all over 
the moulded pudding. Slip carefully to a dish, and eat 
cold.

Italian Minestra Soup. 
Chicken Pudding. Boiled Potatoes. 

Asparagus and Eggs. Crabapple Jelly. 



German Puffs. 



Italian Minkstra Soup. 

Strain the stock reserved for to-day from the bones, 
after taking the fat from the top. Never neglect this. 
Greasy soups are not good, and plenty of dripping may 
be thus obtained for kitchen use. Heat the soup, season 
to taste, and add a Uttle more than half a cupful of min- 
estra, by some known as Italian Paste. It can be had at 
the best grocers in various shapes — like wheat-grains, in 
small squares, or in stars, circles, letters, etc. Simmer 
twenty minutes, and pour out. The minestra should be 
tender, but not broken. 



296 MAV. 

Chicken Pudding. 

Cut up a tender fowl into neat joints, and parboil, sea- 
soning well, ten minutes before you take it up, with pep- 
per, salt, and a generous spoonful of butter. It should 
cook slowly for half an hour. Take up and cool, setting 
aside the liquor for your gravy. 

Batter for the Pudding. 

I quart of milk. 

3 cups of prepared flour, not heaping. 

3 tablespoonfuls of melted butter. 

4 well-whipped eggs. 
A little salt. 

Make a hole in the flour, when you have sifted the salt 
through it. Mix eggs, milk, and butter together, and 
pour in by degrees, beating all up hard at the last. Put 
a layer of chicken in the bottom of a bake-dish ; pour a 
cupful of batter upon it ; then- more chicken, and" so on, 
until the dish is full, with batter for the upper crust. It 
will require about one hour to bake in a moderate oven. 
Skim the cooled gravy, and boil down one-half. Then, 
stir in a tablespoonful of butter, cut up in flour. Boil 
once, and pour over a beaten egg. Season with chopped 
parsley ; return to the fire; let it almost boil, and serve 
in a sauce-boat. Pass with the pudding.' 

Boiled Potatoes. 

Put on in cold water, and bring to a rapid boil. When 
nearly done, pour off all but a cupful of water. Cover 
closely, return to the fire, and steam until the skins crack, 
and the potatoes are soft. They will need about half an 
hour's boiling in all. Uncover, strew with salt, leave for 
a few moments for the moisture to evaporate, and serve at 
once. Old potatoes, treated thus, can be made mealy. 

Asparagus and Eggs. 

Cut about two dozen stalks of asparagus — leaving out 
the hard parts — into inch lengths, and boil tender. 
Drain ; pour upon them a cupful of drawn butter ; stir 



FIRST WEEK— FRIDAY. 297 

until hot, then turn into a bake-dish. Break six eggs 
upon the top ; put a bit of butter upon each ; salt and 
pepper, and put into a quick oven until the eggs are 
"set." 

German Puffs. 

3 cups of prepared flour. 

3 cups of milk. 

3 eggs — whites and yolks whipped separately, and very 
-light. 

3 teaspoonfuls of melted butter. 

I saltspoonful of salt. 

Make a batter as directed for your chicken pudding, 
beat up hard, and bake in nine cups, such as you used 
for measuring, to a fine brown. The oven should be a 
quick one, and the puffs be served immediately in their 
cups.

eggs, and these into the soup. Simmer one minute, stir- 
ring all the while ; take up, add the catsup and pour out. 

Boiled Shad. 

Clean, wash and wipe a large roe shad. Set aside the 
roes for your scallop. Sew up the fish in a thin cloth 
fitted to its shape ; cover well with boiling salted water, 
and cook firom forty-five minutes to an hour, according to 
its size. Unwrap and butter and pepper, after laying it 
upon a hot dish. Pour over it a few spoonfuls of drawn 
butter in which have been mixed the chopped yolks of 
two eggs, a little parsley, and the juice of a lemon. Serve 
the same in a boat. . Garnish the fish with rings of the 
whites of the boiled eggs, with a sprig of parsley in each. 

Scalloped Roes,

I cup of drawn butter, and the yolks of three hard- 
boiled eggs. 
I teaspoonful of anchovy paste. 
Juice of half a lemon. 
I cup of bread-crumbs. 
Parsley, salt and pepper to taste. 

Boil the roes in water with a little vinegar stirred in. 
Lay in cold water five minutes and wipe dry. Break up 
with the back of a spoon, but do not crush the eggs. Set 
by, and pound the boiled yolks to a powder. Beat this 
into the drawn butter, then the parsley and other season- 
ing, finally the roes. Strew .the bottom of a.bake-dish 
with crumbs ; pour in the mixture, and cover thickly with 
fine crumbs. Stick dots of butter over the top, and bake, 
covered, until it begins to bubble, then brown upon the 
uppe;r grating of the oven. 



FIRST WEEK— FRIDAY. 299 

Potato Snow. 

Mash with a beetle very fine, working in salt only. 
Then rub hard and fast through a colander into a hot dish. 
The potato should fall in light spiral threads. Set in the 
oven three minutes to renew the heat, but do not let it 
" crust " or brown. 

Green Peas. 
See receipt given on Sunday. 

Cress Salad. 

Pull the sprigs to pieces and pour over them a dressing 
such as was made for your potato salad on Monday. 

Lemon Trifle.

I pint cream, well sweetened and whipped stiflF. 

I cup of sherry. 

A little nutmeg. 
Let sugar, lemon-juice, and peel lie together two hours 
before you add wine and nutmeg. Strain through dou- 
ble tarlatan, and whip gradually into the frothed cream. 
Serve very soon, heaped in small glasses. Pass cake with 
this as well as with the tea. 

Tea and Cake. 

Whereas pound, jelly, or cup-cake should accompany 
your trifle, small sponge-cakes, or cookies — not too sweet 
— taste better with tea, and do not detract so much from 
its flavor.

into a good shape by sewing about it a broad band of 
stout muslin, as wide as the round is high. Cut a pound 
of salt pork into strips long enough to reach from 
top to bottom of the beef — make incisions in it with a 
thin, long-bladed knife, and thrust these in closely 
together. Fill the hole from which the bone was taken 
with a force-meat of minced pork and crumbs, highly 
spiced. Put' the meat thus prepared in a deep earthen- 
ware dish, and rub well into it a mixture of one cup of 
vinegar, a teaspoonful of mixed cloves and allspice, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and the same of made mustard ; a table- 
spoonful of sugar and a bunch of sweet herbs minced, with 
as much pepper as salt. Leave the beef in the pan with 
the spiced vinegar about the base from Saturday until 
Sunday morning, turning several times. Early on Sun- 
day, put it into a large pot, with enough boiling water to 
half-cover it ; cover tightly with a weight upon the lid, and 
stew at least four hours — or half an hour for each pound. 
Open once, when half-done, to turn the meat. Dish the 
meat ; cut the stitches in the band, and withdraw it care- 
fully. Keep hot while you prepare the gravy. Pour off 
all but a cupful, and set aside for soup-stock. Thicken 
that reserved with browned flour, and serve in a boat. 
Cut the beef in horizontal slices. 

When dinner is over, pin another band tightly about the 
meat ; pour gravy on the top, and set a plate with a heavy 
weight upon it, on the round, before putting it away for 
JMonday's dinner.

shavings, in the bottom of a saucepan ; lay on this a tea- 
spoonful of minced onion, and then the uncooked chick-

one hour — then put into a pot with the vegetables, sliced, 
the chopped herbs and the cold water. Cook gently four 
hours. Strain off the soup, rubbing the vegetables

where it will heat slowly for half an hour. Then set over 
the fire, and stir until the meat is glazed with a brownish 
crust. Put a quart of water — cold — upon it, and bring 
gradually to a boil. Fry the onion and carrot in dripping 
to a fine brown, and drain off the fat, then put the vege- 
tables into the pot with the meat, as soon as the latter is 
boiling hot. Cook half an hour ; put in the rest of the cold 
water, the minced ham, and the bones broken to bits. Boil

and beat fast for one minute ; season and pour into a frying- 
pan in which the butter is heating — not hissing. Shake 
briskly over the fire, slipping your cake-turnfir under it to 
prevent sticking, and in four minutes, double it over in 
the middle and turn out into a hot dish by a dexterous 
inversion of the pan. Lay the ham about it in the dish. 

Ladies' Cabbage.

Mock Turtle Soup. 
Boiled Corned Beef. Young Turnips. 

Casserole of Rice with Calfs Brains. Green Pea Fritters. 



Bananas, Oranges, Nuts, and Raisins. 
Tea, Toasted Crackers, and Cheese. 



Mock Turtle Soup. 

As I stated, after writing out the receipt in full for 
this soup (see Wednesday — Third Week in March), I 
shall not repeat it in this volume. Please, therefore, refer 
to the minute directions then given, and follow them in 
preparing to-day's soup — only leaving out the brains in 
' the force-meat. You may make enough soup for two 
days, keeping that for Friday upon the ice. 

Boiled Corned Beef. 

Select a piece not too salt. The brisket is a good cut 
for family use, when not too fat. Boil in plenty of hot 
water, allowing fifteen minutes per pound. Make a good 
cup of drawn butter, taking some of the beef-liquor — 
strained — as a base. Chop up a little parsley and half a 
pickled onion, and stir into the butter one minute before 
pouring it out into a sauce-boat. Save the liquor for Sat- 
urday. For directions for making drawn butter and other 
sauces, please consult " General Receipts," page 183. 

Young Turnips. 

Peel and quarter. Cook in boiling water, a little salted, 
about half an hour, or until tender. Drain, but do not 
mash. Pepper and salt, then butter, after dishing them. 

Casserole of Rice with Calf's Brains. 

Make a cupful of gravy from the bones and stuffing of 
yesterday's chickens. Cool and skim it. Soak a cup of 



340 MA Y. 

rice two hours in two cups of cold water ; drain this off; 
put the rice into a farina-kettle with the gravy, previously 
heated to a boil, and a cup of boiling water. Season 
with salt and pepper, and cook tender, shaking up once 
in a while, but not stirring. When the rice is nearly dry, 
make a rounded hillock of it in the middle of a dish ; 
strew with grated cheese, and brown upon the upper 
grating of the oven. 

Boil the calf's brains ten minutes; lay in cold water 
twice as long. Then dry well and beat up with an egg, 
pepper, salt, and a very little flour. Fry, by the spoonful, 
in hot fat, drain, and lay around the rice. 

Grekn Pea Fritters. 

1 pint boiled green peas, mashed while hot, with pep- 

per, butter, and salt. 

2 beaten eggs. 
I cup of milk. 

Less than ^ cup prepared flour. 

Beat eggs, milk, and mashed peas smooth, then add the 
flour and fry upon a griddle as you would breakfast-cakes. 

Bananas, Oranges, Nuts and Raisins. 

Pile bananas and oranges together, garnishing with green 
leaves. Put nuts and raisins upon two smaller dishes. 
Pass all at the same course. 

Tea, Toasted Crackers, and Cheese. 

If you have a hot-water pot and a spirit-lamp, make the 
tea upon the table a few minutes before it is needed, then 
cover the pot with a "cozy." This is a pretty, English 
fashion which, I am glad to see, is gaining ground in pur 
country. Butter the split crackers while hot, and send 
around with the tea and cheese.

in another vessel, stir in the floured butter ; boil up ; turn 
into a deep bowl. Pour the lobster in also, stir up faith- 
fully, and turn into a deep disn. 

Potato Pasty. 
Chop your cold, boiled beef fine ; season with pepper 
and add the remains of yesterda/s drawn butter, or make 
more if you have none, putting in parsley and onion 
pickle, chopped. Pour this mixture into a greased bake- 
dish ; cover with hard-boiled eggs, sliced. Work a large 
cup of mashed potato soft with a cup of milk and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter. Add prepared flour until you 
can just roll it out — the softer the better, so long as you 
can handle it. Roll into a thick sheet ; spread upon the 
surface of your mince, printing the edges, and bake in a 
moderate oven to a fine brown.

Then strain the contents of the jar, pressing thesivegeta- 
bles to a pulp. Divide the broth into two portions.

in the refrigerator for to-morrow. Put the other into a 
saucepan, boil two minutes, skim, add the catsup, and 
pour into the tureen. Mem. : Never forget to let the 
soup stand in a broad bowl after straining, long enough 
for the fat to rise and be skimmfed off. 

Roast Beef and Round Potatoes. 

Roast the meat in the usual manner, and, about half 
an hour before taking it out, pour off three-quarters of 
the gravy from the dripping-pan and lay about the meat 
some balls of mashed potato, worked smooth, with pep-

let it cool. Take off the fat ; return to the fire — with the 
seasoning and rice — and simmer half an hour, or until the

into inch-lengths. Chop ham and chicken, and pepper. 
Mix with the macaroni — which should have absorbed the 
broth — stir in the melted butter and eggs. Put into a 
well-greased mould, and boil an hour and a half. Turn

scooped pellets in hot, salted water twenty minutes ; throw 
this off and put in a cup of cold milk. Simmer gently 
until the potatoes are tender ; stir in a good lump of but-

ing, and drop bits of butter upon them. More clams, 
more tomato, etc., until all are in. Pour on the liquor — 
there should be at least three pints — cover, heat slowly 
for half an hour, then boil quite briskly for twenty minutes. 
Meanwhile, soak the split crackers — covered — in the 
boiling milk. When soft all through, butter thickly, and 
keep warm over boiling water until the soup is ready. 
Then line a hot tureen with them, and pour in the chow- 
der. Pass sliced lemon with it. 

Baked Pickerel. 

Select a couple of large, fresh fish ; score the back-bones 
with a sharp knife, and lay them in a baking-pan. Pour 
a cupful of boiling water over them, cover, and bake 
slowly, basting with butter and water, at least six times. 
The fish should be tender, yet firm when done. Transfer 
them carefully to a hot-water dish. Have ready a cupful 
of rich, drawn butter ; strain the gravy from the dripping- 
pan into it, with a little minced parsley. Heat almost to 
a boil and pour over the fish. There is no better way of 
cooking large pickerel than this. 

, Veal Scallop. 

Chop the remains of your fillet fine, and season with 
pepper and salt. Put a layer of dry crumbs in a buttered 
bake-dish ; stick bits of butter over it ; cover with the 
meat and wet this with gravy and warm milk. Repeat 
this order of strata until your dish is full, covering deep 
with crumbs. Fit a tin cover on the top and bake half 
an hour ; remove the lid and brown nicely. Serve in the 
bake-dish.

rowed from the supply meant for your shortcake.

side of a shoulder of lamb, leaving in the shank. Fill 
the cavity thus left with a good force-meat of crumbs, 
chopped pork, and sweet herbs, and sew the meat edges 
together to hold it in. If you have no gravy ready make 
a pint on Saturday of the lamb trimmings and a few veal- 
bones, with seasoning. It need not be strong. Put the 
lamb into a broad pot, with some thin slices of fat pork 
laid in the bottom ; pour in the gravy, cover tightly, and 
stew gently one hour. Turn the meat then, and cook 
twenty minutes longer. ■ Lay the lamb U^on a hot dish,

\ teaspoonful of nutmeg. 

I glass of good claret. 

Add to the soaked gelatine the lemon-juice and peel, 
sugar and spice. Leave standing one hour. Then pour 
on the boiling water. Stir until clear, add the wine, and 
strain through double tarlatan. While it is cooling, whip 
the whites very stiff. When the gelatine begins to coagu- 
late around the edge of the dish, whip it, little by little, 
into the frothed whites until it is stiff. Put into a wet 
mould, and set upon the ice. On Sunday turn it out, and 
pour a rich liqueur — that from brandied peaches is best 
— about the base. Preserved strawberries are also very 
nice with it if you have no liqueur. 

Coffee and Cake. 
If you prefer, you can give the cake with the blanc- 
mange, and drink the coffee afterwards.

of meat. Put into the dripping-pan, pour a cup of gravy 
from the boiling soup — before the vegetables are added — 
about the base, and a few spoonfuls of butter and water 
upon the top. Roast twelve minutes to the pound, bast- 
ing freely and often. Towards the last, dredge with flour,

in the shoulder of mutton with a thin, narrow-bladed knife, 
and thrust in the strips of pork, leaving about a quarter 
of an inch projecting on the upper side. Put into a drip- 
ping-pan, pour two cupfuls of boiling water over it, in 
which has been mixed a glass of claret. Cover with another

salt and pepper, and a few dots of butter upon each layer 
of vegetables, and put upon the pork some chopped sweet 
herbs. Pour the cooled broth over all ; put on the jar 
lid, with a paste of flour and water around the edge to ex- 
clude the air and keep in the steam, and set in a pan of 
boiling water in the oven. Leave it there as long as 
possible — four hours at the least. Pour into the tureen 
without further preparation.

When you can give an uncooked dessert, which is more 
palatable and more wholesome than a cooked one, and that 
costs no more, it is wise policy to avail yourself of the 
consequent lightening of your labors, especially in hot 
weather. Except when it is necessary to deviate from 
the rule in order to secure the requisite variety, let cold 
desserts be the order of the day in your bills of f^re, while

Self-freezing Ice-Cream. 
I quart of rich milk. 
8 beaten eggs. 

3 pints of rich, sweet cream. 

4 cups of sugar. 

r vanilla bean, broken in two, and boiled in the cus- 
tard, or 5 teaspoonfuls of vanilla essence. 

Heat the milk ; pour it upon the eggs and sugar. Cook, 
stirring steadily fifteen minutes, or until it has thickened 
well. When perfectly cold, add the cream. Make the cus- 
tard on Saturday, and set on ice. Early Sunday morning, 
beat in the cream, and put all in an old-fashioned up- 
right freezer, set in its pail. Put a block of ice within a 
stout sack, or between the folds of a piece of carpeting, 
and beat small with a hammer. Put a thick layer into 
the outer part, then one of rock-salt. Fill the pail in this 
order, and, before covering the freezer with ice, beat the 
custard for five minutes with a flat stick or ladle. Shut 
tightly ; pack pounded ice and salt over it, and put a folded 
carpet over all. In an hour and a half, open the freezer, 
first wiping off the salt from about the top. Dislodge the 
frozen custard from sides and bottom with a long knife, 
and beat and stir with your stick, faithfully, until the 
custard is a smooth paste. Replace the cover ; let off the 
water, and pack more pounded ice and salt about it, com- 
pletely concealing the freezer. Put back the folded car- 
pet. The cream will take care of itself for three hours, 
and more, and you can, if you like, leave it all day, with 
a visit of three minutes every few hours, to let off the 
water and pack in more salt and ice. Do not open the 
freezer until you are ready for the cream. Then take it 
out, wipe it off, wrap a towel wrung out in hot Watei •

Should the weather be very hot, you may have to let off 
the water oftener than once in three hours ; but this sel- 
dom happens if the freezer be set in a cool cellar.

Brown Soup. 

\i lb. lean bacon ; 2 onions ; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter ; 
I scant teaspoonful mixed allspice and cloves ; 2 table- 
spoonfuls browned flour ; liquor in which your mutton 
was boiled ; pepper. 

Cut the bacon into strips, and slice the onions. Put 
the butter into your soup-pot with these, and simmer, stir- 
ring often, until they are browned, but not scorched. 
Add the flour, wet up in cold water, and stir until very 
hot. Then, having taken the fat from the top of your 
mutton "pot-liquor," pour it in, with pepper and parsley. 
Add by degrees, stirring well, not to lump the flour. 
Cover, and set at the back of the range to simmer for two 
hours — more would not hurt it. When ready for it, strain 
into the tureen. 

Ragout of Mutton. 

Slice even, rather thick slices, without skin or fat, from 
your boiled mutton, and lay in a deep dish. Pour a good 
glass of claret wine over them, and cover for an hour. 
Make a gravy of the bones and refuse portions with a 
quart of cold water. When this has boiled down to a 
pint, strain it off. Let it cool, and take off the fat. Put 
into a saucepan with a little minced onion, pepper, salt, 
and a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, and boil down to a

large cupful. Then stir in a tablespoonful of browned 
flour, wet up in cold water; simmer three minutes ; add 
the sliced meat and wine, with a httle grated lemon-peel 
and a teaspoonful of currant jelly. Let all get hot slowly, 
but the meat must not boil, or it will be tough. Set at 
one side of the range to heat, until you are ready to pour 
it into a deep dish. 

Squash 1 la CrAme. 
Boil and mash in the customary manner ; press out all 
the water, and beat in a tablespoonful of melted butter, 
with two of cream, heated, pepper and salt to taste ; 
lastly, a beaten egg. Put the mixture into a pail, and set 
in boiling water fifteen minutes, stirring often, and keep- 
ing the water at a boil. It should look like rich custard. 
Serve in a deep dish. 

Mashed Potatoes. 
Prepare as usual, and serve without browning. 

Lettuce Salad. 

Pick out and pull apart the hearts ; pile in a glass dish ; 
sprinkle with sugar, and season to taste with oil, vinegar, 
pepper, and salt. , 

Raspberries, Cream, and Cake.

labor than you like to give to Monday's dinner, make up 
for the loss by serving the dessert given above, sure that 
nobody will murmur. 

Iced Coffee. 

Make more coffee than usual at breakfast-time, and 
stronger. Add one-third as much hot milk as you have 
cotfee, and set away. When cold, put upon ice. Serve 
at dessert, with cracked ice in each tumbler.

Cabbage Soup. 

2 lbs. of lean beef, chopped, and the same of mutton- 
bones, well cracked ; i small, firm white cabbage ; i 
onion ; bunch of sweet herbs ; i cup of milk, heated, with 
a pinch of soda ; i tablespoonful of butter, rubbed in one 
of flour ; pepper and salt ; 3 quarts of water. 

Cook beef, onion, and bones in the water four hours, 
boiling slowly. Boil the cabbage in two waters ; let it 
get cold, and shred only the white parts into rather coarse 
dice. Cool the soup, and take off the fat. Put over the 
fire with pepper and salt and the chopped herbs. Hav- 
ing boiled it one minute, skim, and put in the cabbage. 
Heat the milk in a separate vessel ; stir in the floured 
butter ; boil until it thickens, and pour into the tureen. 
When the cabbage-soup reaches the boil, pour it upon 
the milk, and stir up well. 

Mock Pigeons. 

Take the bone from two nice fillets of veal ; flatten 
them with the broad side of a hatchet, and spread with a 
good force-meat of crumbs and chopped ham, seasoned 
well. Roll the meat up on this ; bind into oblong rolls 
with soft string ; lay in a dripping-pan, and pour over 
them two cups of your boiling soup before the cabbage 
goes in — or any other hot broth will do as well. Turn a 
pan over them and bake nearly two hours, basting well 
with the gravy. When done, lay upon a hot dish, while 
you thicken the gravy with browned flour, and season 
well with pepper, salt, and tomato catsup. Boil one 
minute, and pour part over the pigeons, the rest into a 
boat. Clip the strings carefully, and do not pull them

Add the boiling milk, which has been thickened with the 
floured butter ; stir up well and serve. Pass sliced lemon, 
crackers and butter with it. 

Savory Calf's Head. 

Wash the head well — it should of course have been 
cleaned with the skin on ; take out the tongue and brains ; 
boil them in a separate vessel, and keep on ice for to- 
morrow's soup. Put on the head (the two sides tied into 
the original shape by a band of tape) in plenty of cold 
water, slightly salt, and cook gently one hour and a half. 
Take out, wipe dry, score the cheeks in squares, and 
wash the head on top and sides, with beaten egg. Sift 
over it a mixture of rolled cracker, pepper and salt ; and 
set in a quick oven. In ten minutes, baste with melted 
butter ; five minutes later, with a cupful of broth from the 
pot poured gradually over it. Cover with thick white 
paper and cook ten minutes longer, then dish, with thin 
slices of crisped ham laid about it. Thicken the gravy in 
the pan with browned flour, and send up in a boat. Save 
the pot-liquor for soup, seasoning it, and keeping in a cold 
place. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 

Loosen the skins by pouring boihng water upon them.

to the custard kettle, and stir until thick as hasty pudding. 
Pour, still hot, upon the yolks beaten up with the sugar. 
Whip up thoroughly and let it cool. Whisk the whites very 
stiff and beat rapidly into the cold paste. Butter a mould, 
line thickly with the dredged cherries, and put in the mix- 
ture, carefully, not to disturb the cherries, which should 
stick to the buttered sides. Allow room for swelling in 
the mould. Put on the top, set in a pot of boiling water, 
and cook for an hour and a half. Dip into cold water, 
and turn out upon a hot dish. Eat soon, with a good 
pudding sauce.

quarts of cold water ; pepper and salt ; 6 parboiled pota- 
toes, sliced. 

Crack the bones, and cut the meat into strips. Cover 
with the water, and bring slowly to the boil. When this 
has lasted one hour, skim off the top of the pot, and put 
in the onions fried brown in dripping, the other vegeta- 
bles sliced, and the herbs; cook three hours longer, and 
strain the soup. Season the meat pretty highly and pour 
upon it — in a jar or bowl — ^half the clear stock. Set upon 
the ice for Sunday, when cold. Rub the vegetables 
through the colander into the rest of the stock ; cool, 
take off the fat, season, add the sliced potatoes and the 
oatmeal, and cook one hour more. Strain into the tureen.

onion. Put into a saucepan with a cup of your soup 
taken out before thickening ; season well ; cut the corn 
from the cob and add with the peas, beans, and a sliced 
tomato as soon as the rest are hot. Stew all together 
half an hour. Stir in a great lump of butter rolled in 
flour ; stew five minutes and pour into a deep dish. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 

Loosen the skins with hot water, peel and slice. Stew 
until broken to pieces. Pulp through a coarse sieve, rub- 
bing out all that will pass. Return to the fire with a little 
sugar, pepper and salt, and boil briskly fifteen minutes. 



FOURTH WEEK—SATURDAY. 449 

Stir in, then, enough fine crumbs to make it like a toler- 
ably thick batter ; add a great spoonful of butter ; stew, 
stirring well, five minutes ; pour in the middle of a flat 
dish, and arrange the chops around it.

minutes, and serve. 

Stewed Ducks. 

Clean, wash, and truss neatl)', but do not stuff the 
ducks. Put into a broad saucepan, such as is generally 
known as a braising-pan. Strew with a little onion ; pour 
over them a cupful of weak broth made by boiling the gib- 
lets in a pint of water and reducing one-half. Season this 
well, and when you liave poured it upon the ducks, cover 
the saucepan and cook gently an hour and a half or until

to thirty minutes. Break off the stalks and husks, and 
send to table wrapped in a napkin. 

Fried Egg-plant. 

Cut in slices half an inch thick ; pare each carefully, 
and lay for one hour in salt and water, to remove the bit- 
, ter taste. Then slightly salt and pepper each piece, and 
dip in a batter made of two eggs, half a cup of milk, and 
about a cup of flour, or enough for thin batter. Fry in 
hot lard or dripping to a fine brown; drain well, and 
serve hot.

Scald the milk ; stir in the almond-paste, which should 
have been mixed with rose-water, to prevent oiling. 
Boil one minute, and pour upon the beaten eggs and 
sugar. Return to the fire, and stir until the mixture be- 
gins to thicken. Take off, and pour into a bowl. When

before serving. 

RAGot^T OF Duck and Green Peas. 

Cut the meat from the carcasses left since yesterday, 
making the slices as neat as you can. If you have not a 
large cupful of gravy left, make it by stewing down the 
bones and stuffing in a quart of water, coolirig, skimming, 
and seasoning it. Put this in a saucepan with the pieces 
of duck, and set where it will get very hot, but not boil. 
Cook a quart of tender green peas in boiling water 
twenty minutes; drain, and season them with pepper, 
salt, and butter. Take out the duck and pile in the cen- 
tre of a dish ; put the peas around it like a green hedge. 



FISSr WEEK— MONDAY. 4S3 

Boil up the gravy once when you have stirred in a little 
browned flour, wet with cold water, and pour upon the 
meat. 

Onions. 

Boil in tvvo waters, and after draining off the Ust, cover, 
barely, with boiling milk ; stir in a good piece of butter

triangles of fried bread ; cracker-dust. 

Stir into the hot drawn butter the pepper, salt, nutmeg, 
beaten eggs, and half the cheese, and heat, stirring con- 
stantly, until it thickens. Put a layer of potato upon a flat 
stone-china dish= — or a block-tin one — round it to suit the 
shape of the dish, and cover with the sauce ; this, in turn, 
with a narrowing round of potatoes, but of equal thickness, 
and this with sauce, and so on, until you have a mound 
rounded on top. Coat with sauce, then with the rest of 
the cheese and some pounded cracker, l^ay the sippets 
of fried bread up against it at the base, and heat to brown- 
ing in a quick oven. 

Blackberries, Huckleberries, and Cream.

12 very small and young onions, minus the stalks ; i cup 
of strained tomato sauce ; i cup of green peas ; ^ cup of 
greert corn, cut from the cob ; pepper and salt. 

Cook the beef and bones in the water down to two 
quarts of liquid. Strain, cool, and skim. Meanwhile 
cut carrots and turnips into neat dice or strips, and par- 
boil with the onions five minutes in boili-ng water. Return 
your skimmed and seasoned stock to the fire, and when 
almost on the boil, put in the parboiled and drained vege- 
tables, with peas and corn. Simmer half an hour, add the 
tomato sauce, and cook ten minutes more, then pour out. 

Veal Collops. 

3 lbs. of lean veal, cut into square bits, two inches across, 
and more than half an inch thick ; \ lb. fat salt pork, cut 
into lardoons ; 1 cup of gravy taken from your soup be-

Beef Noodle Soup, 

First — to borrow an idea from worthy Mrs. Glass — make 
the noodles. 



456 AUGUST. 

Take 4 eggs, beaten one minute ; 3 tablespoonfuls of 
water ; enough flour (prepared) for stiff dough, and a 
saltspoonful of salt. Make up, and knead fifteen minutes. 
Roll into a thin sheet, and cut half of it into long strips, 
less than half an inch wide, and these, again, across at in- 
tervals of four inches. Now, roll the other half of the 
sheet up very closely, making a long scroll like a quill. 
Cut this across, with a keen knife, into little wheels less 
than a quarter of an inch wide. Lay all in a sunny win- 
dow to dry. Those intended for to-day will be fit to use 
in two hours. The rest will keep in a dry, cool pl'ace 
several days, and can be used as a vegetable, or in soups. 

Make a stock of 2 lbs. of beef bones, the same of mut- 
ton bones and a slice of lean ham boiled in three quarts 
of water, with i onion, i carrot, and a bunch of herbs 
chopped. Boil down to two quarts, strain ; cool, skim 
and season, and put in a good handful of the noodles — a 
few at a time — so soon as it boils. Simmer twenty minutes. 

Boiled Chickens and Tongue. 

Clean, wash, and truss the chickens ; bind legs and 
wings down closely by tying up the fowls in white, per- 
fectly clean bobbinet lace, or mosquito net. Put on in 
plenty of boiling salted water and cook one hour, unless 
they are large and tough. In that case cook very slowly 
and long. Have ready a tongue, which has soaked sev- 
eral hours in warm water — boiled, skimmed, and trimmed. 
Lay upon a dish with a chicken on each side. Pour a 
few spoonfuls of melted butter, heated, with a little 
chopped parsley, over all three ; set , in a quick oven 
three minutes ; anoint again with the butter and parsley, 
and send to table upon a hot, clean dish. Pass a boat of 
drawn butter with them. Save the chicken licjuor, well 
seasoned, for to morrow's soiip, also the water in which the 
tongue was boiled. If it is a smoked tongue, you can use 
the fat from the top for dripping. If corned, the liquor 
can be added to soups and gravies. 

Fried Egg-plant. 
Please refer to Sunday of this week. 



FIRST WEEK— THURSDAY. 457 

Lima Beans. 

Shell and cook in boiling salted water about thirty min 
utes. Drain, dish, and stir in salt, pepper, and a good 
lump of butter. 

Potato Puffs. 

6 boiled potatoes, mashed soft, with a tablespoonful 
of milk, and as much butter ; 3 beaten eggs ; 6 table- 
spoonfuls of prepared flour, or enough to enable you to 
make into soft dough. Make into balls like doughnuts ; 
roll these in flour, and fry to a fine brown in hot lard. 

Peaches and Cream. 

Pare and slice the peaches just before dinner, and cover 
the glass dish containing them to exclude the air as much 
as may be, since they soon change color. Do not sugar 
them in the dish. They then become preserves — not 
fresh fruit. Pass " fruit sugar" and cream with them.

before cutting them off. Cook forty minutes, stir in but- 
ter and flour, with the parsley. Simmer five minutes, and 
serve. 

Game Muti'on. 

Cut away the under-side of a nice leg of mutton, to 
make it as flat as may be without exposing -the bone. 
Put the pieces thus trimmed off over the fire, with a quart 
of water, and stew down one-half. Cool, skim, season, 
and re-heat. Meantime, lard the upper side of the meat 
with slender lardoons. If you have not a larding-needle 
— which is a pity — use a long-bladed jack-knife to make 
diagonal incisions in the muiton ; then thrust in the lar- 
doons with your fingers, bringing both ends to the surface. 
Now rub the meat all over with hot butter and vinegar, 
letting the surplus trickle into the dripping-pan. Pour 
the boiling pint of gravy over the leg, and roast twelve 
minutes to the pound, basting every ten minutes, copi- 
ously. Just before taking it up, pour off the fat from the 
gravy; dip up a few spoonfuls of the brown juice, and, 
mixing with as much currant jelly, beat in a little browned 
flour, wet up with cold water. Baste the meat with this 
until a fine brown glaze covers it. Serve the gravy, well 
skimmed, in a boat. This is a delightful dish. Carve 
judiciousl}', so as to leave a seemly joint cold for to-mor- 
row.

A Monday Soup. 

Strip all the meat from your chicken-bones, and set in 
a cool place, while you break the •skeletons to pieces, and 
put in a soup-pot at the back of the range, with the dress- 
ing, skin, and gristly bits. Pour on three quarts of water 
and leave it to simmer — always covered — for three hours. 
Strain, rubbing the stuffing through the colander ; cool 
and skim ; return to the fire with a cupful of yesterday's 
soup (there is always a little left over, if it is only saved 
from the swill-pail), also strained. Have ready six Boston 
crackers split and dried in the oven for half an hour, but 
not scorched. Butter these ; lay in the heated tureen ; 
pour upon them two cups of boiling milk, and let soak, 
covered, while you salt and pepper your soup, and add 
a little minced parsley. Should there not be dressing 
enough to thicken it well, stir in a little corn-starch, wet 
with milk. Boil up, and pour upon the crackers. This 
soup need not consume fifteen minutes of your time, and 
is very savory. 

Scallop and Baked Eggs. 

Mince your chicken, but not Sfnall ; cover the bottom 
of a pudding-dish with fine crumbs ; put in the chicken, 
wet with gravy and seasoned to taste ; strew a good coat- 
ing of crumbs on top, and this with butter-bits. Set, cov- 
ered, m the oven. When the gravy bubbles to the surface 
remove the lid and break upon the scallop enough eggs to 
cover it well. Pepper and salt ; lay a piece of butter on

butter ; 1 cup of milk ; 6 quarts of water ; pepper and 
salt. • 

Boil the head in the water with the ham, onion, turnip, 
and carrot sliced, and the chopped herbs. Cover, and 
stew slowly until the bones fall from the meat. Take out 
the head ; return the bones to the soup. ' Divide the meat 
into two portions ; set by one to cool for present use ; 
put the other, highly seasoned, into a large bowl, and strain 
half the stock over it. When cool, set on the ice for to- 
morrow. Chop the calf s ears, and the less desirable parts 
of the meat reserved for to-day, fine, and put back upon 
the bones in the soup. Boil gently half an hour. Mean- 
time, put the butter into a frying-pan, and when hot, stir, 
in the flour. It must not get at all brown. When it is 
again bubbling hot, stir in a cupful of the soup ; boil one 
minute, and pour it out to cool. Strain your soup ; stir 
in the cooled mixture ; boil up and skim, when you have 
seasoned quite highly ; put in three or four handfuls of 
meat-dice cut up from the fat, gelatinous parts of the cold 
head ; simmer to a boil ; pour into the tureen, add the 
milk, boiling hot, and send to table.

lemon ; i tablespoonful of flour, and same of butter ; pep- 
per, salt, and ooion. 

Soak the liver in cold water fifteen minutes ; wipe dry, 
and cut in strips an inch wide, and three long. Cut as 
many thinner strips of bacon, and fry these three minutes 
in their own fat ; take out and keep hot while you fry an 
onion — sliced — with the liver in the same fat. Salt, pep- 
per, and dredge the liver in flour before it goes in. When 
it is done lay in two rows, the length of the dish, with a 
strip of bacon between each piece and the next. Strain 
the fat, and return to the pan with a cupful of hot water, 
the butter rubbed into the flour, and, when it has boiled 
up, the juice of a lemon. Pour over the liver. Pass 
mustard with this dish.

on the ice. There is still gelatine enough in it to make 
it valuable. Boil and skim your soup two or three niin7 
utes, and add a small cup of German sago which has been 
sosriked in a little water one hour. When clear, serve. 

Larded Ducks. 
After cleaning and washing, lard the breasts of a pair 
of ducks with narrow strips of bacon. You must have a 
larding-needle for this, since both ends of the lardoons 
must project upon the same surface. Half roast the 
ducks ; put on in a saucepan, with twp cups of broth 
made by abstracting a cup of jelly from your soup-stock, 
thinning it with boiljng water and seasoning it. Add a

pepper and salt ; dice of fried bread ; i large spoonful of 
tomato catsup. 

Cut up the meat, and chop the vegetables. Put with 
/the herbs and cracked bones into a pot, and pour on two 
quarts of water. Heat slowly, and after it has boiled one 
hour, skim well, and add the other five quarts — also cold. 
Cook steadily four or five hours longer, then strain, rub- 
bing the vegetables to pieces. There should beat least 
five quarts of liquid. If, in the boiling, it has lost too 
much, you should have replenished the pot with boiling 
water. Take out two quarts for to-day's soup. Return 
meat and bones to the fire, and pour the rest of the soup 
over them with another quart of cold water. Cover very 
closely and simmer at the back of the range two hours 
longer. Then set away in an earthenware vessel, having 
seasoned it, and when cold, put on ice. You will now 
have made soup-stock for three days. 

Cool the portion kept out for to-day ; take off all the 
fat, season and re-heat it. Boil gently and skim well.

Vermicelli Soup. 

Take the fat from the top of your soup-stock ; dip out 
rather more than half. Add a httle seasoning to that which 
remains, and return to the ice. Should the weather be very- 
warm it will be wise to heat all together, and then divide, 
returning the smaller portion to the ice-. Warm the stock 
designed for to-day with the remains of yesterday's to- 
mato sauce ; and when it begins to boil, strain through 
thin, coarse muslin. Put back over the fire, and take off 
all the scum that rises in ten minutes' boil. Then put in 
a scant cupful of vermicelli, which has been broken up 
small, boiled five minutes in very hot water, and drained. 
Simmer five minutes, and pour out. 

Roast Beef and Browned Potatoes. 

Have all gristly parts of the beef cut away, and such 
bones removed as will injure the shape, or embarrass the 
carver. Put the beef into a dripping-pan, throw a cupful 
of boiling water over it, and roast ten minutes per pound, 
basting very often and copiously. Just before taking it 
up, dredge with flour and baste once with butter. After 
dishing the meat, pour the top from the gravy ; add a little 
boiling water ; put it into a saucepan, and thicken with 
browned flour. Pepper, and serve after a brief boil. 



498 SEPTEMBER. 

Browned Potatoes. 

Boil, and strip off the skins of large, fair potatoes. Half 
an hour before you take up the meat pour off the fat from 
the gravy ; lay your potatoes in the dripping-pan, and 
cook brown, basting frequently. Lay about the meat 
when dished. > 

Fried Egg-plant. 

Slice half an inch thick, and lay in salt water one hour, 
with a heavy plate on top to keep under the water. Pare 
each slice. Make a batter of two eggs, a cuiA)f milk, a 
little salt, and flour for thin batter. Wipe the egg-plant 
perfectly dry ; dip each slice in the batter, and fry in hot 
dripping. Drain well, and serve on a heated flat dish. 

Boiled Green Corn. 

Strip off all but the thin husk next the corn. Turn this 
down, and pick off the silk from the grains. Replace the 
husk, tie a thread about it to keep it smooth, and cook 
the corn from thirty to forty minutes, according to size 
and age. Pull off the husk ; break the stalk close to the 
ear, and serve, wrapped in a napkin. 

Raw Tomatoes. 

Pare and slice ; put into a salad-dish, and dress as fol-' 
lows : Rub one teaspoonful of sugar, and half as much 
each of pepper, salt, and French or other made mustard, 
smooth with two tablespoonfuls of salad-oil. Beat in, a 
little at a time, five tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and half a 
teaspoonful extract of celery. Pour over the tomatoes,

Heat the milk to scalding. Stir in the sugar and gela- 
tine, and when these are dissolved, beat in the yolks, and 



FIRST WEEK— MONDAY. '499 

cook two minutes. Turn out into a shallow dish to cool. 
When it begins to form, put, a few spoonfuls at a time, 
into a bowl, and whip vigorously, flavoring with rose- 
water. When it is a yellow sponge, piit into a wet mould, 
with a cylinder in the centre. Do this on Saturday. On 
Sunday turn into a dish, and fill the whole in the middle 
with whipped cream, ju^t churned. Lay more whipped 
cream about the base. Like all other preparations of 
gelatine, this should be kept upon ice until you are ready

Cover the breasts and sides with thin slices of fat salt 
pork ; put into a dripping-pan ; pour about them a large 
cijpful of boiling water, and roast — basting often — one 
hour. Take off the pork ; lay it in the gravy, and dredge 
the fowls with flour. As this browns, baste well, with 
butter once, three times with gravy. Take up and keep 
hot while you strain; cool, skim and thicken the gravy. 
Have ready cooked a cup of rice measured when raw — 
which has been boiled in the water used for cooking the

quickly. Roll into two sheets — that intended for the 
upper crust half an inch thick, the lower, rather thinner. 
I /ay the batter in a well greased baking-pan ; cover thickly 
with the berries ; sugar them ; put on the top crust, and 
bake about twenty-five minutes to a nice brown. Cut

SECOND WEEK— THURSDAY. 51/ 

Heat in another saucepan the remains of yesterday's soup 
— or, if you have none, a scant quantity of milk, thickened 
with floured butter ; pour into a tureen, add the egg- 
broth, and throw in a good handful of stale bread-dice. 
Stir well and serve. 

Smothered Chickens with Mushrooms. 
Split a pair of young, full-grown chickens down the 
back. Lay them, breasts upward, in a dripping-pan ; 
pour over them a great cupful of boiling water in which 
have been melted two tablespoonfuls of butter. Invert 
another pan over them, covering closely, and cook in a 
steady oven until they are tender and of a mellow russet 
hue. An hour is generally sufficient. Baste very often, 
twice at the last with butter. Keep the fowls hot upon a 
chafing-dish while you add the rest of the can of mush- 
rooms opened yesterday — each mushroom sliced into 
thirds — to the gravy, with browned flour and pepper. 
Simmer ten minutes ; pour a. little upon the chickens, the 
rest into a boat. 

Scalloped Cauliflower. 
Small, and therefore cheap, cauliflowers will do for this 
purpose. Boil them in hot salted water twenty minutes. 
Drain, cool, and chop. Beat into them a couple of eggs, 
a spoonful of melted butter, a half cup of milk, and season. 
Pour into a buttered bake-dish ; cover with drawn butter, 
then with fine crumbs, and bake half an hour.

have less than a pint left. Or, add hot water to the re- 
mains of yesterday's soup, and strain it. But get a pint 
of weak gravy from' somewhere, and, having soaked a cup 
of rice in just enough water to cover it, for an hour, put 
it over the fire in a farina-kettle, pour in the gravy, and 
cook until the rice is soft, shaking up from the bottom, 
now and then, but never stirring. Take out some for 
your soup. Heap the rest in a deep dish, and pour over 
it a cup of drawn butter, in which have been stirred a 
beaten egg and two tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce. 
N. B. — The gravy should be well seasoned. 

Apple Charlotte. 

Beat two cups of nice apple sauce, well sweetened and 
flavored, to a high froth, with the whipped whites of three

fried onions and carrots, upon these the ox-tails. Grate 
the two whole carrots, and slice the whole onion ; cover

carrots overnight, as the soup should have at least six 
hours' boil. There should be six quarts of soup. Strain 
it off. Put meat and tails into your stock-pot, season 
well, and pour on four quarts of the soup. Keep in a 
cold place for future use.

Larded Steak, Broiled. 

Flatten a large' steak, and lard it with thin strips of fat 
salt pork, bringing all the ends out on one side of the 
steak. You can do this with a knife and your fingers, by 
making two holes for each lardoon, and making a loop of 
it under the steak ; but it is better to have a larding-nee- 
dle. Broil upon a greased gridiron ; lay upon a hot dish ; 
put upon it a little warmed butter, seasoned with pepper, 
salt, and French mustard.

Yesterday's Soup, 

Roast Leg of Lamb. Potato Croquettes. 

Sweet Potatoes. Fried Egg-plant. 

Currant Jelly. 



Rice Snow. 
White Mountain Cake, 



Yesterday's Soup. 

Your mock-turtle soup will be even better the second 
day than on the first. Take off the fat ; dip out enough 
of the stock for your family, and bring slowly to a boil. 
You can make a little variety in it by serving the force- 
meat balls the first day ; the meat dice the second, or 
vice versa. 

Roast Leg of L'amb. 

Lay in the dripping-pan ; pour a cup of boiling water 
over it, and roast steadily, twelve minutes to the pound, 
basting very often. Ten minutes before taking it up, 
dredge with flour, and baste well with butter to make a 
brown froth. Lay on a dish, and keep hot. Pour the 
gravy into a basin set in very cold water. This will send 
the grease to the top. Remove it all ; pour the brown 
gravy into a saucepan ; thicken with browned flour ; season, 
boil once, and serve in a boat. Pass currant-jelly with 
lamb. 



572 OCTOBER.

2 cups mashed potatoes, ifree from lumps ; 2 beaten 
eggs ; I tablespoonful melted butter ; salt and pepper to

flattened at the ends. Roll in flour and fry to a good 
brown. Drain oif upon paper and eat hot. 

Sweet Potatoes, 

Boil until a fork will go easity into the largest. Skin, 
and lay in a bake-pan in the oven a few minutes to dry — 
then serve. 

Fried Egg-plant, 

See Wednesday, First Week in October. 

Rice Snow. 

I quart of milk ; 5 tablespoonfuls of rice flour ; the 
whites of 4 eggs ; i great spoonful of butter ; i cup of 
powdered sugar; a pinch of cinnamon, and same of nut- 
meg ; vanilla, or other extract ; a little salt. 

Scald the milk, and stir in the flour wet up to a thin 
paste with cold milk. Cook until it begins to thicken ; 
add sugar and spice ; simmer five minutes, stirring all the 
while ; pour out, and beat in the butter. Let it get cold j 
flavor, and whip, a spoonful at a time, into the whisked 
whites; Set to form in a wet mould. Prepare on Satur-- 
day. Turn out on Sunday, and eat with sweet cream. 
If more convenient, you can substitute corn-starch for 
the rice flour.

Sago Soup. 
Lamb Pudding. Stewed Corn. 

Potatoes au Naturel. Cabbage Salad. 

Grapes, Pears, and Bananas. 
Tea k la Russe, Crackers and Cheese. 



Sago Soup. 

Cut all the meat from your cold leg of lamb ; crack the 
bone to splinters ; put on, with gristly bits of meat, skin, 
etc., in three quarts of water, with an onion, and boil 
slowly, at the back of the range, down to one quart. 
Strain, cool, and skim. Add to what has been saved 
from the mock-turtle stock made on Saturday. Heat, 
and stir in half a cup of pearl sago, previously soaked 
three hours in a very little water. Season, and simmer 
half an hour. 

Lamb Pudding. 

The cold meat from yesterday's joint ; bread-crumbs ; 
I tablespoonful of butter ; 2 eggs ; a little gravy ; pep- 
per, salt, and a pinch of nutmeg. 

Chop the cold lamb fine, season, and wet up with a 
little good gravy. Mix in one-fourth as much crumbs as 
you have meat ; beat in the melted butter, the eggs, and 
4D0ur into a buttered mould. Set in a pan of hot water, 
and cook, covered, in a good oven for one hour. Turn 
out, and pour a little gravy over it. 

Stewed Corn. 

Green corn, even in city markets, is both indifferent 
and dear at this season. We do better, therefore, to fall 
back upon the invaluable canned vegetables that have 
made American housewives almost independent of chang- 
ing seasons. Open a can of corn one hour before it is to 
be cooked. When ready for it turn into a farina-kettle ; 
pour on just enough hot water to cover it, and cook half 



574 OCTOBER. 

an hour. Then, add a little milk, a good lump of butter 
cut up in flour, pepper and salt to taste, and cook fifteen 
minutes longer. 

Potatoes au, Naturel. 

Put over the fire in cold water ; bring to a boil, and, 
fifteen minutes thereafter, pour in a cup of cold water to 
arrest the boil suddenly. After the beginning of the 
second bubble, cook quite fast until a fork will enter the 
largest potato without forcing. Turn off the water, set 
the uncovered pot upon the fire for a minute ; strip off 
the skins quickly, and serve. 

Cabbage Salad. 

Shred a white cabbage fine ; and pour over it a dress- 
ing such as you made on Thursday, Second Week in 
October, but without the chopped onion. 

Grapes, Pears, and Bananas. 

Heap the grapes in one salver or basket, with a spray 
of some climbing or clinging vine thrown around it. 
Group pears and bananas together, and garnish with 
autumn leaves. 

Tea 1 LA RussE. 

Slice a fresh lemon ; take off all the skin ; lay the 
slices, with powdered sugar strewed over them, in a plate ; 
pour out the tea, hot and strong, with plenty of sugar, 
and pass the lemon with it. Serve without cream. I 
shall ''never forget a surprise that was startling as well aS 
a disappointment, that came to me one day, when, sinking 
under the depression of an incipient headache, brought 
on by miles of picture galleries, I called for a cup of hot 
tea in a foreign restaurant, and was served with what I 
instantly pronounced to be "poison!" ^' Molto buono," 
protested the waiter, opening the tea-urn to show nie a 
whole lemon, skin and all, swimming upon the steaming 
decoction of leaves. The combination of rind and the 
cream with which I had " trimmed " my share of the too- 
fragrant beverage, was indescribable. Still, I — rather — 
like tea a la Russe without lemon-peel and cream. 



THIRD WEEK— TUESDAY. S7S

squares. Season, and simmer about forty-five minutes, or 
until the carrots are tender. Take up the meat ; rub over 
with butter and cover upon a heated dish. Strain the 
soup from the vegetables without breaking them, and set 
the colander in which they are left over boiling water. 
until after the soup is served. Strain this again through 
a soup-sieve, and pour upon plenty of fried bread in the 
tureen. If you hke a thicker soup, return it after the 
second straining, to the fire with a handful of tapioca, or 
of German sago, ready-soaked, and simmer untij clear. 
When the soup is out of the way, arrange the vegetables 
in little heaps around the beef, all of a kind together. 
Put a cupful of the soup over the fire, stir in the floured 
butter, mustard, pepper, and salt, to your liking ; boil up 
and pour over the beef. '

the addition of a cup of boiling water, and put, meantime, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter into a clean saucepan. 
When it heats, stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour. Stir 
fast, and, to keep it from browning, put in, now and then, 
a few spoonfuls of soup. Cook five minutes ; add grad- 
ually to the soup ; put in the pieces of meat, with more 
seasoning, if required ; boil once, pour into the tureen, 
and add a cup of boiUng milk. 

Roast Beef. 

Lay in a dripping-pan, pour a cupful of boiling water 
over it, and cook, basting often, about ten minutes per 
pound. If there is much fat on ■ it, cover these parts with 
a paste of flour and water, until the meat is nearly done. 
Ten minutes before taking it up, dredge with flour, then 
baste once with butter. If you like made gravy with beef, 
pour off the fat from the top ; thicken with browned flour, 
season and boil once. 



Yorkshire Pudding.

through it. Set in a round, deep baking-pan. Sprinkle 
with minced onion, and pour over it a pint of gravy — the 
remains of that which accompanied the roast, mixed with 
some from. the stock-pot. Season the gravy well with 
pepper, salt, minced herbs, and a suspicion of French 
mustard. It should be cold, and the oven slow, for the 
first hour — never fast. Cover very tightly ; open the 
dish at the end of one hour, and turn the meat, but pay it 
no further attention until two hours have passed. Then 
dish it ; strain the gravy ; thicken as much as you want 
for your meat with browned flour ; boil up, and pour over 
the beef. The rest can be set by for other uses. If the 
beef has been cooked slowly and steadily, it will be tender 
and most savory. 

Potatoes au Gratin. ' ., 

Boil and mash the potatoes ; press firmly in a greased 
bowl ; turn out upon a shallow pie-plate, also greased ; 
wash all over with raw egg ; sift fine crumbs upon it, and 
brown in a quick oven. Slip to a hot, flat dish. 

I 
Kidney Beans — Fricasseed. 

Soak all night. Next day, put on in cold water, at the 
back of the range, and cook tender. When you turn your 
beef, after an hour's cooking, dip out half a cupful of the 
gravy. Cool and skim it ; add a little minced parsley 
and onion, and, when your beans are soft, pour off nearly 
all the water, and add this gravy. There should be just 
enough to keep them- from getting dry. Simmer ten min- 
utes, and dish without draining. 

Grapes, Boiled Chestnuts, Apples. 

Arrange the grapes in a fruit-dish, ornamented with 
leaves. Put on the chestnuts in warm (not hot) water, 
slightly salted. Bring to a boil, and cook fast fifteen min- 
utes. Drain in a colander ; stir a spoonful of butter into 
the chestnuts, tossing in the colander until dry. Serve in

Chop a few slices of the twice-served cold beef very fine ; 
mix with one-third as much cold mashed potato, wet with 
gravy ; season well ; bind with a beaten egg, and stir in a 
greased saucepan until quite stiff. Let it get cold ; make 
into small olive-shaped balls ; flour, and lay aside. Strain 
off the liquid, from your stock-pot ; bring to a boil, adding 
hot water or seasoning, as the case may require ; boil, and 
skim for five minutes, and drop in the beef-olives carefully. 
Simmer one minute — fast boiling would break them — and 
pour out. If you have any pickled olives in the house, 
add a dozen to the soup when you put in the beef-balls. 

Mutton Stew, wjcth Dumplings. 

3 lbs. of lean mutton, cut into short strips ; \ lb. of salt 
pork, chopped ; \ onipn, minced ; chopped parsley and 
thyme ; i cup of milk ; i tablespoonful of flour wet up

Put on the mutton in enough cold water to cover it, and 
cook very slowly one hour. Then add the pork, onion, 
pepper, and herbs, and stew an hour longer. Make out 
a Uttle paste, in the proportion used for the apple dump- 
lings on Wednesday, Third Week in October ; cut into 
strips, and drop into the stew. Cook ten minutes ; take 
out meat and dumplings with a skimmer ; lay upon a dish ;

tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan, and when it heats, 
run it all over the bottom. Pour in the omelette, shaking 
and loosening from the sides with a spatula. So soon as 
it is done at the edges sufficiently to be folded, lay a great 
spoonful of jam or jelly upon it ; fold over, and turn out 
upon a stone-china dish. The m%ringue, made of the

3 lbs. lean veal ; i onion ; \ lb. pearl barley ; 4 quarts 
of water ; salt, pepper, and a cup of milk. 



FOURTH WEEK— WEDNESDAY. 589 

Cut the veal and onion very small ; put on with the 
barley. Boil slowly until reduced to two quarts. Strain, 
rubbing the barley through a sieve. Season with pepper 
and salt ; simmer three minutes. It should be white and 
thick as cream, when you have added the cup of boiling 
milk, after which it must not boil. 

Boiled Ham. 

Soak a ham four or five hours. Scrub it well, and put 
on to boil in plenty of cold water. Cook eighteen or twenty 
minutes to the pound. When done, leave in the water one 
hour in the open air, or where it will cool rapidly. Take 
off the skin carefully ; rub all over with flour ; sift fine 
crumbs over the top and sides, and set ten minutes in a 
quick oven. Wind frilled paper about the shank, and 
where the paper joins the body of the ham, twine a wreath 
of parsley. 

Chopped Cabbage. 

Cut off stalks and green leaves, and quarter a cabbage. 
Boil fifteen minutes in hot salted water ; pour this off, and 
cover the cabbage with pot-liquor, taken from the ham- 
kettle, and the fat skimmed off. Cook tender ; drain, 
pressing hard ; chop, and again drain ; season with pep- 
per, salt, and a little vinegar, and dish very hot.

Cut the citron int.o strips, and stick in regular rows in 
the top of the cake. Six hours before you will want to 
use it, pour over it, a Uttle at a time, the liquor. It 
should absorb it all, and hold it with Dutch perseverance. 
Heat the milk ; pour upon the beaten yolks and sugar. 
Stir and cook until it thickens. When cold, pour around 
the cake, as it lies upon a long dish, and cover the domi- 
nie and his bed with a miringue of the whites, beaten up

bles and herbs, and cook three hours longer, replenishing 
with boiling water as the liquid sinks. There should be 
five quarts of soup. Strain ; lay aside the sheep's tongue 
to cool, with the meat from one of the feet. Season the 
rest of the meat and bones ; put into the stock-pot ; pour 
over it all the soup not needed for to-day, also the

I pint of boiling water ; i cup of coarse yellow meal, 
or enough for thick mush ; a little salt. 

Put the water over the fire ; add the salted meal, and 
stir constantly until it has cooked twenty minutes, and 
bubbles up in the middle. Turn upon a flat dish, and, 
when cold and stiff, cut into squares ; dip these into flour, 
and fry to a yellow-brown. Drain off the fat. This is a 
favorite dish with the Italian peasantry, who generally, 
however, eat it without frying. 

Stewed Salsify. 

Scrape ; clean, without cutting the roots ; drop into 
cold water as you clean them. Put on in boiling water, 
a little salt ; when tender, take out a cupful of the water,

fitting neatly to one another ; strew with sliced onion, and 
cover entirely with very thin slices of fat salt pork, or 
bacon. Fit a close top on the saucepan ; cook very 
slowly, never allowing it to bubble, for one hour. The 
liver should be steamed, not stewed, much less fried. 
When very tender, take it out and lay upon a dish. Add 
a tablespoonful of tomato sauce to the gravy, thicken with 
browned flour wet with water ; boil once, and pour over 
the liver.

Bread Soup. 
Save your crusts for several days for this soup. Break 
about half a pound of them into small pieces, and lay in 
an open oven to dry, while you skim your soup-stock ; 
add an onion, and put over the fire to boil. Cook gently 
half an hour ; strain ; return to the kettle, and when it 
boils again put in the crusts. Cook slowly twenty mm- 
utes, stir, and beat the bread to a porridge, add seasonmg 
and a little minced parsley, and boil one minute. 



652 DECEMBER. 

Lobster Croquettes. 

I can of preserved lobster ; 2 eggs ; 2 tablespoonfuls of 
butter ; \ cup fine crumbs ; yolks of two hard-boiled 
eggs — pounded, then worked into the butter ; juice of 
half a lemon \ salt, cayenne pepper, a pinch of mace, and 
one of lemon-peel ; beaten yolks of 2 raw eggs. 

Mince the meat ; work in the warmed butter and pound- 
ed yolks, the seasoning, raw eggs — at last, the crumbs. 
Make into oblong balls or rolls ; -roll in flour, and fry in 
sweet lard. Drain upon clean paper, rolling each cro- 
quette lightly upon it, and dish. Pass cream crackers and 
sliced lemon with these excellent croquettes, and make a 
separate course of them. 

Braised Grouse. 
Clean thoroughly, washing out the inside in soda and 
water, and then rinsing and wiping. Truss, but do not 
stuff the birds ; tie them in shape. Cover the bottom of 
a saucepan with slices of fat salt pork ; lay the grouse 
upon these ; sprinkle minced onion and parsley ovef them 
with pepper, salt, and a little sugar. Cover with more 
pork, and pour in a large cupful of soup-stock, or other 
broth. If you cannot spare this, put butter and water, 
although it is not so good. Cover very closely ; simmer 
one hour ; turn the birds, and cook — always covered — 
until tender. Dish the grouse ; strain the gravy ; thick- 
en with browned flour ; boil up, and pour into a boat. 
Partridges, wild pigeons, and tough chickens may be 
cooked in this way — also ducks. 

Salsify Fritters. 

Wash, scrape, and grate the roots, letting them fall from 
the grater into a batter made of two eggs, half a cup of 
milk, flour enough for thin batter, and a little salt and 
pepper. It should be like raw fritters when mixed. Drop, 
by the spoonful, into the hot fat. As fast as they are fried 
throw into a hot colander, set over a bowl in the oven.

quettes ; roll in egg and cracker-crumbs, and fry, a few at

Creamed Potatoes. 

Boil, and, while hot, slice the potatoes. Make a sauce 
by heating a cup of milk, stirring into it a great spoonful 
of butter, a scant teaspoonful of corn-starth, wet in cold 
water, a little chopped parsley, and boiling until thickened. 
Beat in the frothed white of an egg, and pour upon the

and any bones you may chance to have. Simmer one 
hour, or more ; strain, return to the fire, and boil and 
skim for five minutes, before dropping in a generous 
handful of noodles— dried, or fresh. Simmer twenty min- 
utes. For receipt for noodles, please consult Wednesday, 
First Week in August. 

Roast Pig. 

See that your butcher has done his part well in clean- 
ing the month-old pig. Rinse out with soda and water, 
then with fair water, wiping the pig dry, inside and out. 
Prepare a dressing of a cupful of crumbs, half a chopped 
Dnion, two teaspoonfuls powdered sage, three tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter, a saltspoonful of salt, and as much 
pepper, half a grated nutmeg, and the yolks of two beaten 
eggs. Moisten with half a cup of soup-stock, and stuff 
the little fellow into his original size and shape. Sew him 
up, and place in a kneeling posture in a dripping-pan, 
skewering or tying his legs in the proper position. 
Dredge with flour. Pour a little hot salted water in the 
dripping-pan. Baste with butter and water three times as 
the pig warms ; afterward, with gravy from the dripping- 
pan. When he begins to smoke all over, rub every ten 
minutes with a rag dipped in melted butter. This will 
keep the skin from cracking. Roast in a moderate, 
steady oven two hours. 

Put the innocent — still kneeling — upon a large hot 
dish; surround with parsley and blanched celery-tops. 
Put a wreath of green about his neck, and a sprig of cel- 
ery in his mouth. 

Skim and strain the gravy ; thicken with browned flour ; 
boil up, add a glass of wine and the juice of a lemon, and 
serve in a boat. 

In carving, cut ofif the head first ; then split down the 
back ; take off hams and shoulders, and separate the ribs.

" The very beat, the most sensible, the most practica., the most honest 
book on this matter of getting up good dinners, and living in a decent, 
Christian way, that has yet found its way in our household/'— Watchman 
AND Reflector, 

COMMON SENSE 

IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 
A MANUAL OF PRACTICAL HOUSEWIFERY. 

By MARION HARIAND, 

Author of "Alone," "Hidden Path," "Nemesis," &o., Ac. 



One Vol. 12II10, cloth, . . Price $1.75 
KiTCHRN Edition, in Oil Cloth Covers, at same price. 



See what the Critics and Practical Hotisekeepers say about it: 

"In the hands of the author, whose name is well known in another 
department of literature, the subject has been treated with thorouglui>,ss 
and skill, showing that a little common sense may be as successful in the 
concoction of a toothsome viand as in the composition of a romance." 

N. Y. Daily Tribune. 

" It inspires us with a great respect for the housewifery of a literary 
lady, and we cannot err in predicting for it a wide popularity." 

N. Y, Evening Post. 

" Unites the merits of a trustworthy receipt-book with the freshness of 
a familiar talk on household affairs." — Albany Evening Journal. 

"The directions are clear, practical, and so good in their way that the 
only wonder is how any one head could hold so many pots, kettles and 
pans, and such a world of gastronomic good things." — Hearth and Home. 

" The recipes are clearly expressed, easy to follow, and not at all 
expensive. The suggestions about household affairs are chic. On a test 
comparison witli three other American cook-books, it comes out ahead 
upon every count. Beyond this experto credo nothing more need be said." 

Christian Union.

" The air of elegance and taste which first breathes upon us from the cover, and comes 
OS with a spicy aroma from the title-page, pervades every feature of the book — paper and 
type, text and illustration — from beginning to end ; indeed, no work of the kind, which 
has yet appeared in this country, quite equals it in a certain combination of richness and 
simplicity." — 77ie JV. V. Tribune. 

"The text and illustrations have also the unmistakable stamp of original investigation 
and independent feeling for the tasteful and refined in household decoration." — Tke 
N. Y. Times. ^ 

*' The charm of it lies deeper than in paper surface and letter-press and graver's lines ; 
and wherever it goes it will educate, inspire and refine." — Tke Literary World. 

*" It is one of the mo-^t practical and useful books of its kind, and hits exactly the 
wants of to-day.^' — Hartford Courant. 

" Mr. Cook's book— it seems as if any dwelling, no matter how humble, laight make 
itself to blossom with touches of real beauty by the following of some of his wise sugges- 
tions.** — Tke Congregationalist. 

*'The book is a beautiful one, and it will be a treasure in the hands of all who can 
appreciate the beautiful, and are asking the important question — 'How shall we furnish 
our homes 1 * " — Christian at Work. 

" Mr. Cook is not a slave to any one style of furniture or furnishing." — Cincinnati 
Gazette. 

*' In the simple adoption of the means to the end to be reached will be found the true 
artistic elegance and comfort. We commend this volume to the perusal of all who are 
mterested in making home-life beautiful." — Baltimore Gazette^
