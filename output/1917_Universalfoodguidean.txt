INTRODUCTION 



NEVER before in the history of the world has the problem of food preservation 
been such an all important matter and subject of decision as today. Al- 
though this is true, this nation and the greater part of the world is now at war, 
therefore we must learn to conserve food. So important is this subject that if by 
any way at all we should have a shortage of food in fact, it might bring about the 
defeat of this great country in this war, and with us the defeat of all our allies 
with whom we are now fighting for the freedom of the world. 

If you are too young, too old, or perhaps physically unfit for military service, 
there is still a duty for you to perform — you can assist materially in the conser- 
vation of our food supply. As the slogan for our recent Red Cross drive was, "If 
you cannot fight you can give," so the slogan for all time during the war should 

be, ":F YOU CANNOT FIGHT YOU CAN SAVE IN FOOD AND MONEY." We have shown 

our loyalty to the cause by our over subscription of our allotted amount to the Red 
Cross, so why should we not also show our future loyalty by concerted and united 
effort in conservation of food and food supplies. 

This duty to our country is of such vital importance that I have been moved 
to gather together available information as to this great problem in the way of 
facts, statistics and drawn from my own knowledge, which same I have had 
printed herein. 

Although you may have given your last dollar to the cause, or toward helping 
to care for our wounded soldiers, and supposing you are not able physically or 
otherwise to go to the front and take active part on the battlefield, there still re- 
mains a work for you to do: you may help in the conservation of food campaign. 

I especially invite the enlistment of women, our greatest workers, in this 
campaign; the solving of the problem lies within the hands of our women. You 
women — mother, sister, wife, daughter or sweetheart — may by conserving the 
food in your hands and larders, assist to the greatest extent your husband, brother 
or sweetheart at the front. We do not know for how long a time our boys shall 
have to stay at the front fighting the great enemy, but while there they must have 
fcod and clothing as wtll as guns and amunition, and it is up to you to see that 
there is no real shortage of food. 

Owing to the present crop outlook and to the ever increasing waste of food in 
our homes, it becomes necessary that some active steps be taken at once toward 
an endeavor at stepping the waste. With this idea in mind and with my anxiety 
as to the health cf this great people at heart, I have arranged in the following 
pages numerous chaits showing composition of foods, proper combination of food 
products, amounts of foods necessary to sustain life, together with a number of 
different menus. From experience I have learned that few people know the true 
food values of food products, so for that reason I have compiled the different 
economy menus showing the exact amount of food necessary to sustain life, to- 
gether with the different elements contained in the products used or suggested. 

In preparing this pamphlet I have embraced what I considered the very best 
authorities available on the food question, freely drawing on such authors as 
Eugene Christian, food specialist of New York City; Otto Carque of Los Angeles, 
Cal., and Dr. H. A. Stockdale of the City of Portland, Oregon, to whom at this 
time I give full credit for the matters taken from their respective works, and I 
am sure that this pamphlet will be invaluable to the thinking people of our nation. 

Not only will this pamphlet serve as a guide and text book in the conservation 
of food, but in my mind it will be instrumental in bringing a better and higher 
standard of health, peace and happiness to all mankind.

CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF NUTRITION 

A GUIDE TO HEALTH, WEALTH AND FREEDOM 

Nearly all our definite knowledge of the chemical composition of food mate- 
rials and their nutritive value has been achieved within recent time. Fifty years 
ago nobody knew what our bodies and our foods were composed of and how the 
different nutritive ingredients of food served their purposes in nutrition, and even 
today the majority of people understand but vsry little about what their food con- 
tains, how it nourishes them, whether they are economical or wasteful in buying 
or preparing it for use, or whether or not the food is rightly fitted to the de- 
mands of the body. 

Modern physiology U aches us that we need food to build and repair the vari- 
ous tissues of the body and to supply it with heat and energy. Every motion, 
every exertion of the muscles, the beating of the heart, the circulation of the 
blood, the respiration of the lungs, every thought of our brain, every impression 
that our senses receive, is attended with a waste of some portion of the tissues, 
and this loss must be replaced by a proper supply of food containing the corres- 
ponding elements. 

Chemistry shows that our body is made up by from fifteen to twenty elements, 
the most abundant of which are oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, po- 
tassium, sodium, iron, phosphorus, sulphur, etc. ; water, protein, fats, carbohy- 
drates and mineral salts are the principal combinations into which these elements 
are formed. 

Water, composed of hydrogen and oxygen, forms over 60 per cent of the 
weight of the body of the average man and is a component part of all tissues, be- 
ing therefore an important constituent of our food. 

Protein, composed of nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, sulphur and phosphorus, 
forms about 18 per cent of the weight of our body. Protein compounds which 
principally repair the wear and tear of the tissues, are chiefly found in nuts, also 
as albumen in the white of eggs, as casein in milk, as gluten in wheat and as 
legumin in pulses. 

Fats, composed of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon, form about 15 per cent of 
the body of a healthy man. They serve to maintain bodily heat and to create 
muscular energy and are also stored up in the body as a reserve fund to preserve 
the tissues in case of emergency. Fats are contained as high as to 60 per cent in 
nuts which contain it also in the purest form. 

Carbohydrates contains the same chemical elements as the fats, only in a less 
concentrated form. They exist abundantly in nearly all plantfocds, especially in 
the starch of cereals and in the sugar of sweet fruits. Carbohydrates are not di- 
rectly required, like protein, to build up or repair the cells of the body, but they 
are readily oxydized into carbonic acid and water, carrying on the process of com- 
bustion in the tissues, and are therefore of great value as fuel material to keep 
up the temperature of the body and muscular activity. 

The body of the vertebrate animals is composed of fifteen elements, viz : 
Oxygen, hydrogen, nytrogen, carbon, calcium, phosphorus, chlorine, sulphur, po- 
tassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, silicon, fluorine, and manganese, all of which 
are important in the growth and perpetuation of animal life and in the perform- 
ance of the various physiological functions of the organism. The twelve mineral 
elements, however, are not equally distributed all over the animal body, but we 
find that the skeleton chiefly contains calcium, that in the muscular tissues which 
are consumed as "meat" only potassium and phosphorus are predominant, while 
the mineral matter of the blood is composed principally of sodium and chlorine 
(from 60 to 90 per cent.) Iron is found in the haemoglobin of the red blood cor- 



puscles; on account of its great affinity to oxygen it readily takes up the latter in 
the lungs and forwards it to the arteries and capillaries to all parts of the body; 
it is therefore of great value in keeping up the oxydizing processes in the tissues, 
and consequently in the creation of animal heat and magnetism. A deficiency of 
iron in the blood causes chlorosis, dyscrasia and other abnormal conditions. Sodi- 
um, on the other hand, combines with the carbonic acid which is constantly cre- 
ated by the oxydizing processes in the tissues and discharges it again through the 
lungs. Sodium and chlorine in the combination of sodium-chloride are necessary 
for the formation of the saliva, gastric and pancreatic juices; sodium is also found 
in the bile. The lack of this mineral in our food, and consequently in our blood, 
increases the acidity of the latter and gives rise to digestive troubles, eventually 
leading to chronic dyspepsia, diabetes, rheumatism, gout, etc. The sodium in the 
blood further serves for making the calcium oxide contained in our food more sol- 
uble and keeping it in a liquid state for perfect assimilation. The latter element 
in connection with some phosphorus, magnesium and silicon is building up our 
bones and teeth. Sulphur and silicon are necessary for an abundant growth of 
hair. Fluorine is found in the enamel of the teeth. 

Calcium, of which meat is almost entirely deficient, makes up nearly 50 per 
cent of the mineral matter of our body. The lack of this element in our food is 
the cause of defective development of the skeleton and diseases of the bones 
(rickets, curvature of the spine, osteomalacia, premature decay of the teeth, etc.) 

Silica, as a good insulator, has also the property to keep the heat and elec- 
tricity of our body together; it has, like all alkaline minerals, a strong antiseptic 
puwer, protecting our body against epidemic diseases. Chlorine gives likewise 
firmity to the tissues and makes the fibres of the nerves running through the walls 
of the bloodvessels good conductors for the electric current which is constantly 
generated by the circulating, magnetic blood. 

To enjoy perfect health and immunity against disease, our blood must there- 
fore contain all these elements in their wonderful combinations; because it is the 
blood which carries them to the different parts of the body, nourishing and cleans- 
ing the tissues, creating animal heat, magnetism and electricity, which depend 
chiefly on the presence of chlorine, todium and iron in the blood ! 

It is impossible within this limited space to go into further detail in regard to 
the varied relations of the twelve mineral elements of our body, but enough has 
been said to direct henceforth the studies of the chemists, physiologists, and above 
all, the physicians, to th!s highly important subject. 

Fruits, nuts, vegetables and cereals, if taken judiciously, make better and 
purer blood and consequently give more vitality than foodstuffs which are more or 
less stimulants; meat weakens our digestive power, because it does not supply the 
elements necessary for the renewal of the digestive juices; it further fails, on ac- 
count of lack of cellulose, to exert that mechanical influence upon the walls of the 
intestines which is necessary for the peristaltic movement of the bowels. Dys- 
pepsia, constipation, appendicitis are common among meat-eating nations. 

Nature has furnished us with teeth and salivary glands for the purpose of 
mastication and salivation and we have to devote a certain amount of time each 
day to the proper feeding of our body or suffer the consequences sooner or later. 
Why is it that the average duration of life of "civilized" man is hardly more than 
33 years instead of a century? Why is it that we have in this country an army of 
over 100,000 physicians who can hardly raise the standard of health? Most assur- 
edly because of the majority of people are still deplorably ignorant in regard to 
the mechanism of the body and especially to the laws of nutrition. 

Waste matter is continually discharged through the lungs, kidneys, skin and 
intestines, fresh material is brought in, and in the course of several years our 
body is entirely renewed. The blood must convey all the necessary elements of 



nutrition to repair the daily wear and tear of our system . The blood in turn is 
made from our food and drink and it is therefore by no means a matter of indif- 
ference what we eat. 

In the meantime the majority of physicians are still hunting after germs and 
bacilli, confounding effect with cause, utterly ignorant of the most important 
chemical and physiological facts. What we need is not vaccine, tuberculin, anti- 
toxin, poisonous drugs, stimulants and narcotics, but natural and wholesome food, 
pure water, fresh air and sunshine, which alone can give us health, strength, vi- 
tality and supreme power of resistance ! 

The diet question deserves altogether far more attention by the average man 
than it receives now. Instructions in these matters should form one of the most 
important parts of every common school education, as we can hardly expect that 
people who know little or nothing about the mechanism of their bodies will be able 
to maintain physical and mental vigor in themselves and their offspring. 

All progressive physicians admit that a large number of diseases is due to the 
excessive amount of protein we take in our nourishment. On the other hand, an 
inadequate supply of mineral elements as has already been pointed out is equally 
detrimental, especially during the time of growth of the organism. Not enough 
can be warned of the prevalent use of whita flour, refined sugar and candy which 
contain little or no organic salts. 

In reading the chemical analysis of food materials we must bear in mind also, 
that we cannot always determine the food value of an article by the percentage of 
its constituents or its price alone, for all food which promotes health and vitality 
has in itself an element of economy of the highest value. Our body is sometimes 
Lkened to a steam engine, but food has more to do than to build and repair organs 
and supply them with energy. We have a brain and a nervous system, we have 
sensibilities and higher intelectual faculties, which are all more or less influenced 
by the quality of our nourishment. 

Calcium, phosphorus, sulphur and iron are used in the formation of the essen- 
tial structures of the body. Without a constant renewal of the elements of iron 
and sodium, the blood cannot take up sufficient oxygen and the products of com- 
bustion (carbon dioxide, uric acid, etc.,) cannot be neutralized and eliminated. 
As proteid substances are used up in the life processes of the cells of the body, 
the phosphorus and sulphur contained therein give rise to the formation of sul- 
phuric and phosphoric acids. These and certain other acids must be neutralized 
in order to preserve the alkalinity of the blood and tissues. The normal alkalinity 
of the blood rests chiefly on the sodium ions and is essential to the physiological 
oxidation of the nutritive cell contents of the tissues. This alkalinity is increased 
by fruit and green leaf vegetables and lessened by meats, broths and cereals. 

If there is a deficiency of alkaline salts in the food, ammonia, for a time, will 
be split off from the proteids of the body, but entire absence of alkaline salts 
from the food for even a brief period will cause death from autointoxication. 

The alkaline salts of fruits and vegetables act as natural laxatives by promot- 
ing the action of the secreting glands; they also assist in the preservation of nor- 
mal physical conditions within the cells. The chlorides furnish the chlorine of the 
hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice, pepsin being inactive except in the presence 
of hydrochloric acid. In the small intestine the alkaline salts assist in the diges- 
tion of fats. 

To enjoy permanent health and immunity from disease, our blood must con- 
tain all the necessary elements in the right proportions and combinations, because 
it is the blood which carries them to the different parts of the body, nourishing 
and cleansing the tissues, creating animal heat, magnetism and electricity. As 
long as the importance of the organic salts in our system is not recognized and 



understood, so long must there exist a deplorable guesswork, both in regard to 
diagnosis and the treatment of disease. 

Professor W. 0. At water, who made a number of investigations in regard to 
the purchase and preparation of nourishment, interpreting the observations of 
practical life in different parts of the country, says that a fourfold mistake in 
food economy is very commonly made. 

First, the costlier foods are used when the less expensive are just as nutrious 
and can be made nearly or quite as palatable. 

Second, the diet is apt to be one-sided, in that foods are used which furnish rel - 
atively too much of the nitrogenous materials and too little of the fuel-ingredients. 

Third, excessive quantities of food are used; part of the excess is eaten and 
always to the detriment of health; part is thrown away in the table and kitchen 
waste. 

Fourth, we are guilty of serious errors in our cooking. We waste a great deal 
of fuel in the preparation of our food, and even then a great deal of food is badly 
cooked: 

Few people, indeed, seem to realize what an immense quantity of the very 
best food material is lost in the artificial preparation of our nourishment and if we 
would gather statistics in this respect, the figures would be astonishing. In spite 
of the wonderful progress of science during the last century the average house- 
wife seems still to live in complete darkness in regard to the most important fac- 
tors on which health and happiness in life depend. 

A great field for useful reform opens here and the large number of mission- 
aries who go to foreign lands.every year, would find a splendid opportunity to 
show their usefulness right at home, by teaching the people the simple laws of 
nature and hygiene. 

As a result of thorough mastication, not only a smaller quantity of food is re- 
quired, but it is also unquestionable that there is a still greater saving in the 
economy of vital energy. It certainly takes strength and vigor to digest the un- 
necessary food stuffs. When they are not digested, they ferment and decompose 
and cause all forms of physical disturbances, including neuralgia, rheumatism, 
lassitude, obesity, dropsy, kidney and bladder troubles; in fact, there is hardly a 
disease which is not aggravated or induced by an over-consumption of food im- 
perfectly digested. 

The housewife often prides herself in the preparation of sumptuous dinners, 
but she forgets that in most instances the sun has already done all the necessary 
cooking and thit she can hardly improve on the natural qualities and flavors of 
the food. On the other hand, the display of a great variety of dishes at one meal 
and the extensive use of condiments always lead to over-eating. 

If the world's most successful athletes find that a high degree of physical 
health is best attained by eating little or no meat, and such tremendous mental 
and physical workers as Thomas Edison and Nicholas Tesla do not find meat a nec- 
essary article of diet, then we need not fear to experiment a little in the same 
direction. 

People living on a cooked diet must therefore have, as they say, at least three 
square meals a day and yet the majority of them are dyspeptic and half-starved, 
otherwise the many manufacturers of "dyspepsia tablets and pills" could not 
spend millions of dollars for advertisements every year, in order to unload their 
nostrums upon an ignorant public who are still foolish enough to believejthat health 
can be bought in the drug store. 

During the past century steam and electricity have greatly revolutionized hu- 
man society and wonderful industrial achievements have been made, yet it ap- 
pears to the close observer that our progress has been one-sided in many respects 
and that throughout the civilized world millions still suffer from want of shelter 



and food. The great investigators and inventors were certainly striving for the 
emancipation of mankind but their hopes have not yet been realized. The devel- 
opment of industry has drawn many people from the country to the cities, and ag- 
riculture and horticulture have been neglected, much to the detriment of man's 
welfare. 

Today, hundreds of thousands of human beings are huddled together like cat- 
tle in sweat-shops and factories, producing luxuries for foreign lands while they 
themselves and their families are often deprived of the very necessities of life- 
Go to the industrial and mining districts of every country, watch how the con- 
sumptive, half-starved men and women and children are staggering to and from 
their places of toil. 

Agriculture and horticulture are at their infancy and the peasant is generally 
pictured as "the man with the hoe," or bending over the plow, working from 
morn till night, and reaping as a reward a rude bed, dry bread, and a dreary life 
ofdrudgeryar.dt.il. But in the future we will find the cultivator of the soil 
standing erect, enjoying ample leisure, and producing by a few hour's work each 
day sufficient food to nourish, not only his own family, but a hundred men more. 
The agriculturist of the future will be able to make his own soil, defy seasons and 
climates, warm both air and earth by giving to the culture of the field no more 
time than what each can do with pleasure and ease. 

While it is true that in some of the leading countries, like England and North 
America, an excess of meat is eaten, the injurious influence of such a diet is al- 
ready felt, and there is a striking evidence that the people of the larger towns at 
any rate are physically deteriorating. During the recent war with the Boers it 
occurred that of 11, COO men who volunteered at Manchester for service in South 
Africa, only 3000 were accepted as physically fit, and of these only 1200 came up 
to the standard of what a soldier ought to be; and Colonel Borrett, the Inspector- 
General of Recruiting, in his recently published record, intimates that of 7f>,0C0 
men medically examined, as many as 22,283, or 23.04 per cent, were rejected for 
various ailments or want of physical development, adding that among the class of 
men from which recruits are drawn deterioration of tha teeth appears to be 
rapidly increasing. As of course only men with what is regarded as a reasonable 
prospect of acceptance present themselves at recruiting stations, there must be 
among the masses, behind the diamal squad of the rejected, huge battalions of 
patently disqualified men— mentally detective, deformed, crippled, scrofulous, 
purblind, narrow-chested — to whom no thought of soldiership ever oc ars. The 
sum total of our physical shortcomings must be a figure that would be woeful 
to contemplate. 

Every child has a divine right to the best possible birth its parents can give 
it, and this fact should be more widely recognized, especially among the more in- 
telligent and progressive people. The formation of the character of the child 
must begin wilh the self-reformation of all who want to perpetuate their own 
life in that of their offspring. 

In her noble struggle for independence woman now look for suffrage, but she 
will find that she is chasing after a phantom and she can never gain exemption 
from drudgery, as little as man, by the ballot alone, If she would devote the 
same time that she now spends for the follies of fashion, reading shppery novels, 
gossipping or doing unnecessary kitchen work, to study and practice of the laws of 
of nature and health, she would soon be able to free herself from the many tribu- 
lations which fill her life with suffering and sorrow. 

To be sure, many are forced by lack of opportunity into a miserable struggle 
for existence; but it is more the undervaluation of his own powers, the failure to 
recognize and develop the divine spark which nature has implanted in every hu- 
man being that keeps man from rising to the higher realms of life. For thous- 

a 



ands of years he has been trampled and humiliated, because he has looked up to 
a "great unknown power" which would deliver him from all evil; he has sought 
his God everywhere but in himself. Every man is a part of the Supreme Intelli- 
gence which pervades the universe, and by constantly and perseveringly develop- 
ing his mental and physical faculties he will at last come to the realization of his 
own almost unlimited powers and possibilities. 

In the present enervating struggle for existence man should be first of all 
taught how to take proper care of himself, how to fully develop body and mind 
and to live a full and useful life, useful to himself and to others. The study of 
anatomy, physiology and hygiene should form an important part of every common 
school education, as we can hardly expect that people who know little or nothing 
about the mechanism of their bodies will be able to maintain physical and mental 
vigor in themselves and their offspring. 

Unfortunately, much that is called education at present simply unfits man to 
successfully fight the battle of life. Thousands are wasting time with the study 
of things which will be of little or no value to them or others. 

The great need of the present time is, above all, a better standard of health 
and morals. Nature has intended that man should live at least one hundred years; 
he should increase his physical and mental powers until he is fifty years of age, 
and retain them at least for another scoie of years. Yet comparatively few in- 
stances are on record of vigorous men at seventy. But when man comes to live 
hygeienically he will enjoy ninety and a hundred years of vigorous adult life, or 
more than threefold than now. 

With the increasing knowledge of our actual position in nature, we may hope- 
fully look forward to the time when an age of temperance, an age of sanitary re- 
form, an age of plain living and high thinking shall have man so regenerated that 
he will walk the earth a century or more, carrying out the great law of evolution 
which culminates in the physical and mental perfection of the human race.

This combination chart was compiled by Eugene Christian, Food Specialist of 
New York City. 

It is impractical to print ready reference tables showing the harmony of more 
than three articles, but the student can judge this sufficiently well for himself by 
comparing the respective harmonies of the several foods of the group. Nearly all 
stomach and intestinal troubles begin with superacidity. This is caused by 
wrong combinations of food. 

IF YOU WISH TO LIVE ACCORDING TO LAW OF CHEMICAL HAR- 
MONY, FOLLOW CHART. 

When preparing your food glance over your CHART, and you will make no mis- 
take. In case of sickness make combinations represented by Fig. 1, that being 
the best combination.

The most gripping subject of the day is Human Health. Up to the present 
time the masses have given but little thought to their Mental and Physical well 
being. History shows a few shining examples of prodigious mental and physical 
strength, and in every instance such accomplishments were due to judicial living. 
If the masses could, or would, but emulate these few examples what a wonderful 
race we would have. 

The very insistent demand on every hand for greater efficiency has at last 

brought out the fact that, 
CLASSIFICATION in order to have efficiency we 

must first have health. Indi- 
viduals, corporations and the 
governments are after effic- 
iency, of which the great un- 
derlying fundamental is health. 
When it comes to the cruical 
test you are measured by the 
standard of your health. The 
individual that can do great 
things outside of himself is 
generally great inside — he is 
in good health. 

Due to the present mode of 
living, the greatest sin com- 
mitted against human health 
is wrong eating. Eating too 
much, eating wrong kinds of 
foods in relation to the indi- 
vidual's age, environment and 
the season of the year. Incor- 
rect proportioning of Protein, 
Starches, Fats and Mineral 
Foods for the amount and kind 
of labor done. But, the great- 
est danger lies in faulty chem- 
ical combinations. Foods 
wrongly combined from the 
chemical standpoint generate 
about thirty-five destructive 
poisons within the human in- 
testines. 

In order to eliminate the 
manufacture of these deadly 
poisons from the Alimentary 
Canal, long years of experience have enabled me to devise a simple Chart which, 
from the chemical standpoint, covers practically the entire field of food combin- 
ation. By studying the Chart and carefully reading my additional directions, you 
can make no mistake. 

Bread, Cookies, Cakes, Pie Crusts, Oatmeal Breakfast Foods and all manner 
of Grain and Starchy foods, such as the Irish and Sweet Potato (including the Ba- 
nana). All these are to be combined only with the first and second group, the 
Alkaline and Neutral foods. Scientifically speaking, the Carbohydrates or 



Mixed or combined as 
follows: Alkaline foods 
with neutral foods. Acid 
foods with neutral foods. 
Milk should never be 
combined with acid or veg- 
etable foods. 

Milk can be combined 
with sweet fiuits, but in 
case of sickness even that 
should not be done. Do 
not combine starches with 
acids. 

When severe stomach 
trouble exists, very care- 
ful combinations should 
be made.

rational Gastronomy. Learn to eat for Health.

(Starches) do not belong in any group given in the chart, but they combine best 
with the first two groups mentioned. The Irish and Sweet Potatoes are freaks in 
the vegetable kingdom; in their raw state they belong with the vegetables, but 
when cooked become a Starch and are then classed with the Grains. Banana holds 
the same relation in the fruit family. 

Melons are a semi-sweet food, they combine well with the first and second 
groups, not quite so well with Milk, and not at all with the Acid Foods. Melons 
are a fine corrective food and should be used freely during their season. 

The Neutral Group will combine well with any food, but are most palatable 
with the acids. When eating an acid with a neutral food do not take a starchy 
food with it, for the acids will not agree with the starches — this is very important 
when Stomach Trouble exists. The neutral foods are Fish and meats of all kinds; 
all kinds of Cheese, excepting Cottage Cheese. Cottage Cheese when quite dry 
and free of lactic acid, and combined with a good deal of pure Cream can be class- 
ed with neutral foods and combined accordingly; when it is fresh it combines well 
only with the neutrals. Nuts, Dry Beans or Peas, Lentils and Soy Beans are not 
only the most perfect substitutes for flesh foods, but, they are better foods from 
the standpoint of health. 

The Acid Foods are very much abused, or rather they abuse the body when 
injudiciously combined with other foods, especially with starches and milk; the 
acids coagulate the protein in milk into a solid ball of curd rendering it almost 
absolutely indigestible. Acids cause the starches to violently ferment — they will 
not mix; instead they set up a chemical reaction in the stomach and bowels and 
literally explode; the liberated poisons are absorbed into the circulatory system 
and poison every atom of the body. 

Fats: Butter, Vegetable and Animal Oils, and all classes of fat Flesh Foods 
combine admirably with all other foods; however, there is some danger in eating 
too much of these foods. Fats are a highly concentrated food, persons leading a 
sedentary life should be especially careful and not over eat of them. Those who 
can assimilate such foods are liable to obesity, while those who cannot become 
emaciated and thin. Fatty foods and Oils retard the natural flow and secretion 
of the digestive juices, but vegetables and fruits have the opposite effect. To 
stimulate the flow of the gastric juices at meal time eat some greens or fruits 
first, this is a good rule in cases of chronic indigestion. Fats also generate injuri- 
ous fatty acids; only people who work very hard need this class of food. 

Sugar is a Carbohydrate of a very stimulating nature. It gives quick energy 
which lasts only for a short period; sugar is a false nutrient and very unnecessary 
in the Temperate and Torrid Climates. There is no single food in existance which 
undermines so quickly and completely the enduring qualities of Man. If too much 
of this food is eaten its destructive acids undermine the stability of the Alkiline 
Salts of the body, which are like the stones in a wall of a foundation; this is most 
plainly evidenced in our teeth, they may be soft and crumbly, or full of cavities; 
other parts of the body suffer likewise but the evidence in more hidden or is longer 
in coming to light. In destructive influence I would say sugar is as dangerous as 
liquor, if not more so, at this present date. If a desire is felt for sweets, use 
Honey and Sweet Fruits. 

Demineralized foods are Sugar, White Flour and all foods to a certain extent 
that are over-cooked Over-cooking destroys the mineral value of foods according 
to the length of time in cooking and the intensity of heat used. The U . S. Gov- 
ernment Bulletin No. 141, page 46, says: "Beef round, lean, small pieces, dura- 
tion of cooking two hours. Loss of Ash (or Mineral) was seventy per cent." 
This is only a single example, but it applies to every cooked food in a lesser or 
greater degree. The diet of today is woefully deficient in Organic Salts. The 
medical and food authorities give this vitaly important point little attention. One 



part of an Enzyme, a powerful digestive fluid, can digest forty thousand parts of 
food without hardly any loss to itself. These and many other wonderful digestive 
juices are manufactured principally from the mineral matter which the body ob- 
tains from foods. 

The great importance of Organic Mineral Matter in our diet can hardly be 
overestimated. If we eat less of the high mineral containing food than our body 
needs, we become demineralized, and that is a state of disease. Foods that are 
heavy in mineral are extremely efficacious in counteracting bodily poisons. If you 
wish to maintain the vigorous stamina that your body is heir to, eat at least a 
pound of raw food each day, such as fruits and vegetables. Keep this up for a 
few months ar.d you will be surprised at the general increase of your efficiency and 
health. Study the chart giving the minerals in the different foods and you will 
make no mistake. 

It has been said that most people do not die — they kill themselves with their 
own poisons that are manufactured in their system. Indiscreet eating is directly 
responsible for nearly all human woes; some lose their snap and vigor and pass 
through life in a sort of shiftless-don't-care manner; some develop a melancholy 
and pessimistic nature which renders them unsuccessful in social and business life, 
and there are a few who even sink into the most abysmal brutality and crime. 
All this is not done by pure intent. Such persons are sick, sick because the chem- 
ical condition of their body is off balance, due primarily to what and how they eat. 
No man has a right to abuse or neglect his health. He owes it to himself, to his 
posterity and to his Maker, intelligent endeavor to be physically strong and well. 
There is nothing sadder that can befall us on earth than, after having enjoyed the 
blessings of health and vigor, to be laid aside because of physical decay — we have 
become physically incompetent. All this can be warded off only by intelligent 
health culture. — Dr. H. A. Stockdale, 416 Panama Building, Portland, Oregon. 



The enlightened life is one of moderation in all things, but especially in the 
matter of diet. 

Try to exercise a little each day, it is vitally essential for the distribution of 
bodily nutriment, also f^r elimination of morbid matter. If you wish to be use- 
ful to others, look after your health first. 

Everything we get in this world we must pay for. If you want good health 
you must pay for it with regular attention to your physical needs. 

Do not worry under any circumstances, it does only harm. 

Cool constructive thinking will stop many of your troubles. 

Be a master of your forces and try to live the healthy and efficient life. 

The more simple one's diet, the less the craving of the nervous system for 
unnatural foods and harmful stimulants. 

It is quite impossible to have peace in the head and war in the storrafh. 
Course eating and fine thinking is incompatible. 

Don't try to live upon mushes, soups and other easily swallowed foods. Cul- 
tivate a liking for fibrous and more firm foods that need to be masticated. They 
will bring you health. 

You owe it to yourself to learn how to get the most out of your mental and 
physical faculties. Don't be a health slacker. 

The cook stove is very useful but is very much abused by over work. We 
should cook less and eat more raw food.

cording to Calorie Content. Dr. H. A. Stockdale, Portland, Oregon. 



HOW TO FIND YOUR INDIVIDUAL FOOD REQUIREMENTS 

First, consult the table and see what the ideal weight is for your 
height. This table will also give the proper number of calories for 
the ideal weights. If you are under the ideal weight for your 
height, add five calories a day to your diet for each pound under- 
weight. If you are over the ideal weight, subtract ten calories a 
day for each pound over weight. 

The table is made up for people of sedentary habits, with daily 
exercise equal to two hours walking. For each additional hour of 
active physical labor or exercise, add one hundred calories. 

Note: Do not confuse work that is fatiguing from cramped 
posture with labor involving the active use of the larger muscles. 

A woman of the same weight requires less food than a man, as 
less of the ideal feminine body is composed of muscular tissue.

This Chart I borrow from Dr. Eugene Christian, the Pioneer in Food Science 
and the ablest Dietician of the present age. Dr. H. A. Stockdale. 



The diet of primitive man was of things that grew out of the earth and upon 

trees. 

The best foods are injurious when over-eaten or when wrongly combined with 
other foods. 

To thoroughly energise every muscle of the body, walk five or six miles each 
day in a brisk manner or do work equivalent in amount. 

More men dig their own graves with their teeth than starve to death.— Dr. 
H. A. Stockdale.

HOW MUCH SHOULD WE EAT? 

In order to determine your individual food requirements you may simply refer 
to Chart giving- Height, Weight and Number of Calories, then refer to Chart giv- 
ing Calories in ounces. This will enable you to arrange each meal according to 
the number of Calories you wish to eat. If your attention is properly given to the 
charts and statements contained in this book, you will obtain certain and most 
gratifying results. 

The principle of adjusting one's diet should be fundamentally the same as run- 
ning an automobile or some other intricate machine. If in a certain distance we 
feed the automobile two or three gallons of gasoline when only one is needed, the 
carburetors become clogged, the bearings strained and general damage results to 
the mechanism. A more lucid example would be to turn the power full, then put 
the brakes on; only a fool would try that, but some persons actually try that on 
their body. They take in a lot of power through the medium of food, and never 
try to use it up— they are continually exploding from fermentation. 

Eating should be like the counting and spending of money : if you have a one 
dollar bill and a twenty dollar bill, you can purchase twenty times as much with 
the twenty dollar bill as you can with the one, yet they are of the same size. 
v ou can buy for ten cents a pound of food which will give you only one hundred 
calo.ies or fifteen hundred calories. When you know the different values of money 
you fan not be cheated, but you are constantly cheating yourself of money and 
health by not knowing the different values of food. 

Eating should be governed according to the calorie principle, the unit of meas- 
uring the heat energy of food . One calorie of food energy in your body means 
the same as one pound of steam in a boiler. It takes a certain amount of fuel to 
make a hundred pounds ol steam. If too much fuel is given and no power used, 
we cause an explosion. Ope ordinary thick slice of bread, weighing one and three- 
tenths ounces will give you one hundred calories; that will furnish energy to walk 
nearly two miles. It takes twelve ordinary stalks of celery, weighing eighteen 
ounces, to produce the same amount of energy, costing many times more. You 
can walk one mile on sixty calories; on two thousand five hundred calories you can 
walk forty-two miles in one day. If you eat that much food and do not perform 
physical labor equal to such a walk, you are perhaps eating too much. However, 
it should be considered that a few persons use up more nerve force than others in 
doing the same amount of work. With the assistance of the Charts you can adjust 
this to an exactness, when you will be in possession of eating the correct amount. 

Sickness is an unnecessary self-inflicted calamity. Don't be a shameful and 
sorry burden to yourself, family, friends and the Nation; a sniveling, useless, dis- 
eased element called man or woman. Be the real article— straight of spine, high 
upstanding chest, wide open eyes scintilating with unflinching courage; a red- 
blooded man that can, and will, do his share in all things. Such men and women 
the Nation needs at this hour. Be one of them and proudly bear the heritage of 
nature. Dr. H. A. Stockdale.
