To Color Soups 

A fine amber color is obtained by adding finely grr- 
ted carrot to the clear stock, when it is qnite free from 
scum. 

Red is obtained, by using red skinned tomatoes from 
which the skin and seeds have been strained out. 
Only white vegetables should be used in white soup* 
as chicken. 

Spinach leaves pounded in a mortar, and the juice 
expressed then added to the soup will gi\^ a green color

The fluther of this book, believes that if the work- 
ing class of this country, would pay less attention to 
politics; and look more to domestic orhcusthcld econ- 
omy, there would be a vast change in their financial 
conditions. While these " &ECRKTS of SUCCESS " 
are to the interest of the general public, they are es- 
pecially desighned for that class of people, known as 
Working men; or the E^ck-bcne of TVianicind. The 
Workingman lives hard, works hard, and remains peer 
The cause can easily be seen. He relieves the lowest 
wages; and pays the highest retail price for all he neeels. 
The '' SHCRHTSof SUCCESS ' in this book, are 
published with the belief that it will do good to these; 
that have never had theoppertunity to obtain iheni. 

Whoever puts any of these on the market, can Rive 
them such names that might have a tendency to add to 
their sales. From the sales of some of these secrets; 
thousands of dollars have been made. If you desire to 
commence Business; select one of these Pvcciepts which 
you tl.i ik would be tiie most saleble in ycur locaMtv. 
and manufacture It in small quantities, until your de- 
mand grows larger. Sell to families and stores, leave it 
on commission, and advertize it in every way; and ycu 
will soon have an income, that will surprise 3^011.

84 HOW TO FIND EMPLOYMENT 

when cut of work 

f'T^I»aration To Clean Wall Paper. 

Take 1 quart of wheat flour, and )^ p*nt of powder- 
ed prepared whiting; and mix thoroughly, add enough 
water to make an ordinary stiff dough. Use a piece a- 
bout the size of a goose egg, and maKe long stroKes, 
by pressing hard against the wall; alter each stroke 
knead into the dough, and continue until it is useless. 
This is enough for a good sized room. 

CAUPEr CLKANER. 

Take 3 pints of alcohol diluted with 1 pint of water, 
and mix with >^ gallon of liquid ammonia. — Remove 
the dirt by applying this solution first; then dissolve 
2 V^ pounds of soap in 3 quarts of water, and add i lb 
of soda, and 2 oz. of liquid ammonia and spirits of wine 
now apply this solution; and the carpet will regain its 
original color, and the carpet need not be taken up. 

A good worker can do a good sized carpet in a cou- 
ple of hours. 

What To INVKNT. 

Cheap useful articles that vrill sell at sight. Some- 
thing that everyone needs, and the poorest can afford- 
Invent simple things for the benefit of the masses, and 
your fortune is made. Some ^y^ears ago a yankee made 
a fortune by attaching a rubber string to a wooden ball 
A German made a fortune by patenting a simple wood- 
en plug for beer barrels. These things cost scarcely 
anything:, yet millions are sold. All it takes is; Pluck
