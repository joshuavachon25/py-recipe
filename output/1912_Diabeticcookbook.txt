To those whose diet^ for one reason or 
another, is restricted as to starches and sugars, 
and who may be interested in a more varied 
dietary than that which ordinarily is available 
under such circumstances, this little volume is 
dedicated. 



PREFACE 

A DIET which excludes the carbohydrates naturally 
deprives the patient of an important group of nutri- 
tive principles; and it is extremely important that, 
in order to maintain the requirements of nutrition, 
those food principles which are left to constitute the 
whole diet should be made as attractive and relish- 
able as possible. For it is well known that the in- 
viting appearance, agreeable flavor, and a pleasing 
variety of dishes have a decided influence upon the 
secretions and all of the processes involved in the 
physiological appropriation of food. 

Diabetes, it is conceded, frequently if not always, 
arises in connection with some disturbance of the 
nervous system; and any unfavorable psychic in- 
fluence bearing upon the processes of nutrition, 
which readily may be produced by a monotonous, 
distasteful, or uninviting diet, should be avoided 
as far as possible. 

To meet this phase of the subject the author has 
striven earnestly; and it is her fond hope that many 

7 



8 PREFACE 

diabetic sufferers may profit by her efforts, not only 
in increased enjoyment of their dietary, but in greater 
chance of ultimate recovery. 

The recipes given in the following pages have been 
recorded carefully from practical experience. Each 
of them has been verified repeatedly; and it is be- 
lieved that any person of ordinary cooking-intel- 
ligence, by following the directions given, can 
accompUsh satisfactory results; and thus produce a 
considerable variety of delicious desserts, as well as 
light, digestible, and very palatable bread, muflSns, 
etc., containing the minimum of starch and sugar. 

Gluten flours vary considerably in the propor- 
tion of starch they contain. Those which contain 
the least amount of starch may be used whenever 
it is desired to eliminate this element from the diet 
aa far as possible; those which contain larger pro- 
portions may be used when a limited amoimt of 
starch can be tolerated. Gluten flours generally are 
different and more difficult to handle successfully 
than wheat flours; but they respond to proper 
manipulation, which can be acquired readily by ex- 
perience. 

Saccharin, as a remedy in certain forms of dys- 
pepsia, and as a substitute for sugar, has been 
prescribed by the medical profession for many years. 
Its use in cooking should never exceed the amoimt 



PREFACE 9 

necessary to sweeten the food; as an excess of it 
renders the product disagreeable to taste. 

It is to be understood that nothing which is in- 
corporated in this volume shall be construed as a 
recommendation of any particular make or brand 
of so-called gluten flour, or any gluten product; nor 
is the standard of any such flour or product vouched 
for in any manner whatsoever. The information 
given is simply a true statement of what has been 
done successfully and repeatedly with the materials 
and methods cited. Other similar materials, em- 
ployed in the same manner, might have proved 
equally satisfactory. 



SPECIAL DIRECTIONS 

The measurements in the following recipes must 
be accurate to insure success. 

A measuring cup holds one half pint, and is 
divided into fourths and thirds. 

When flour is to be measiired, sift it firet; then 
lift it Ughtly by spoonfuls into the cup until the 
cup is evenly filled. Do not press it down. 

One teaspoon of baking powder is measured by 
putting the spoon in the powder, taking up what it 
will hold, and then shaking it lightly until it is just 
roimded over. 

One level teaspoon is leveled off with a knife. 

One half teaspoon is measured by dividing through 
the middle of the spoon lengthwise. 

Tablespoonfuls are measured in the same way. 

A tablespoon of butter, melted, is measured be- 
fore melting. 

A tablespoon of melted butter is measured 
after melting. 

When using melted butter, do not have it hot; 
only soft. 

10 



SPECIAL DIRECTIONS 11 

One cup of cream, whipped, means cream measm-ed 
before whipping. 

When baking any of the bread stufis, have the 
oven moderate as to heat and do not bake anything 
else in the oven at the same time which might 
create any moisttire. The breads will not be satis- 
factory unless the oven is kept dry. Should the oven 
be too hot when the bread is first put in, leave 
the door open about an inch, for fifteen or twenty 
minutes, or imtil the loaf has had time to rise to 
its full height, without any crust forming. Then 
continue baking with a moderate heat. 

The breads and muflSns require long, slow baking, 
as they are inclined to be moist in the center if 
the crust forms too soon. 

The Baking Powder used is " Rumford's," pre- 
pared by Rumford Chemical Works, Providence, 
R. L 

In many of the recipes, when milk is recommended, 
cream diluted with water may be substituted, if 
desired. 

Knox's gelatine has been used by the author; 
and Saccharin, as manufactured by f Messrs. Parke, 
Davis & Co., in one-half grain tablets, has been 
found satisfactory. The latter, when called for, 
should be stirred until dissolved in one teaspoon 
of warm water before adding to the mixture.

Gives entire satisfaction to the physicians and patients

GUM GLUTEN FOODS-WHERE PRODUCED 

A barrel of flour (196 pounds) yields about sixteen pounds 
of Gluten and one hundred fifty pounds of starch and other 
starchy products. It is, therefore, obvious that Gum Gluten 
can be produced economically only in a wheat starch factory. 
No milling process can produce starch, neither can it pro- 
duce gluten.
