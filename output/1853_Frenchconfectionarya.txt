This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

FRENCH CONFECTIONARY 



FOR 



ENGLISH FAMILIES. 



PASTE FOR TARTS, CAKES, AND 

BISCUITS. 

The various kinds of paste used in families 
are made in many ways, according to the purpose 
for which they are required. 

Three fundamental principles must be attended 
to by the amateur or the artiste : 

First, a judicious choice of materials. 

Secondly, the knowledge of preparing the 
article, so as to form an agreeable combina- 
tion. 

The third principle is the mode of prepara- 
tion, so as to make it suitable for whatever use it 
is to be applied. 

B 



2 PASTE FOR TARTS^ 

The choice of flour and butter must^ of course, 
be carefully attended to, as the delicacy of the 
pastry or cakes depend on the good quality of 
each. Nothing so much deteriorates from it as 
strong or ill-flavoured butter ; on this, however. I 
need not make further comment, but commence 
my subject. 

FATE BRISEE. 

This paste is used for all sorts of pies, of 
game, hare, meat, &c., excepting for venison 
pasties or wild boar, when p&te bise is used. 
You must judge of the quantity of paste you 
require, attending to the following proportions : 
Put two quarts or pounds of flour on your paste- 
board, and make a hole in the middle ; add to it 
half an ounce of fine salt, and half a pound of 
fresh butter, which you must soften by handling 
or beating it a little with your hand before you 
rub it in the paste; mix it with lukewarm 
water, adding it by degrees till you form gently a 
firm paste; work it with your hand well, shaking 
a little flour over it occasionally to prevent it 
sticking to the board. When it is well mixed 
and worked, cover it over, and let it remain two 
hours to rise. In winter you must work the 
paste more than in summer, and if you like, you 



CAKES^ AND BISCUITS. 3 

may eren add a little more butter. When you 
wish to use it for tarts^ you must mix it with 
cold water^ and use more butter. When it 
has risen^ roll it out for the purpose you require. 

« FATE BISE. 

To make this paste^ you must use coarse flour. 
Take the quantity you require^ add a little butter^ 
very little salt^ and knead it into a stifl* paste^ 
adding by degrees some warm water. You must 
work it well, as this flour requires more kneading 
than fine flour. Put it by for an hour to rise, 
and then roll it out to raise your pies ; ornament 
the paste at pleasure. This paste is for pasties 
of venison, wild boar or kid, or any raised pies. 
Egg them over a few minutes before they are 
taken out of the oven to colour them. 

PATE A L'HUILE. 

The proportions are four pounds of flour to a 
pint of oil and three or four eggs. Mix it, as 
before, with warm water ; let it rise an hour, and 
then it is fit for use. This receipt will not suit 
English ideas, but I give it as a novelty. 

PATE AU LAIT. 

Warm some milk ; add a very small piece of 
butter, some salt to your flour, and wet it with 

B 2 



4 PASTE FOB TABTS^ 

some warm milk till a good paste ; then lay it 
aside for au hour to rise. This paste is used for 
croquettes and croquignolles. By adding a 
little yeast to this paste^ it makes very delicious

Take the proportions of three eggs to a pound 
of flour; mix ahout a quarter of a pound of 
hutter and a little salt in a pound of flour ; then 
break in the eggs, and mix them^ adding a little 
warm water till a light paste ; add a little yeasty 
and lay it by, covered over, to rise for four 
hours ; then work it again, roll it out and use it. 
When you add sugar and candied lemon-peel, 
working the paste well, it is used to make the 
little cakes called " gateaux des rois/^ 

PATE FEUILLETEE. 

Put two or three pounds of flour on your

till like snow ; then^ with a paste-brushy put a 
layer of butter on the paste; double it imme- 
diately^ flour and roll it out ; then put another 
layer of the butter^ and again double and roll it 
out equally. Do the same four or five times 
till all the butter is in the paste. It is then fit 
for use. 

FATE GBASSE 

Is made in the same manner as common paste, 
using melted suet in place of butter. It is good 
for meat pies that are to be eaten hot. Melt the 
suet in a saucepan, and pour it into cold water. 
Do this several times to take off the greasy fla- 
vour, and to remove all the filaments, then pour 
it into a jar to keep for use. 

FATE AU MIEL. 

This paste is made nearly the same as sugar 
paste, only substituting honey for sugar ; but you 
must use rather less honey, because it is sweeter 
than sugar. Make a paste with flour, butter, 
and a little salt, rather stiffer than usual, because

the honey^ as it melts^ softeDs the paste^ and 
risks breaking in different places if too soft. 
When you wish the paste to be sweety melt a 
pound of honey in a pint of warm water^ with 
which wet the flour into a stiff paste. Boll it 
out and add the butter in the same manner as in 
the pftte feuilletee. 

PATE A LA FRANGIPANE. 

This is a delicate kind of paste^ and is made 
with sweet almonds^ blanched and pounded fine^ 
some beef marrow^ which must be pounded to 
the consistency of butter, and sifted sugar. 
Pound all together till well mixed, add a little 
cream, and fill your tarts with the mixture. 
When done, sift a little sugar over. As a 
change, you may add a little orange-flower water 
to the almonds when pounding, and strew some 
slices of preserved lemon-peel in it. 

PATE SUCREE. 

Take a pound of flour, mix with it a quarter 
of a pound of sifted sugar and the same of

put a pound of flour on the boards make a hole 
in the middle^ and put in your almond paste, 
with four eggs^ a bit of salt^ and a quarter of a 
pound of butter, and wet it with some hot milk ; 
work it well, lay it aside for half an hour only, 
and then make it into little tartlets and cdkes, 
Sec. You can vary the flavour by using vanilla 
essence or orange-flower water to taste. 

PATE AUX MABBONS. 

Choose some fine chesnuts, and boil them well, 
or roast them, to take off the*skin ; then pound 
them in a mortar, with a pinch of coriander seed, 
half a pound of sifted sugar, and some pista- 
ehios ; mix well together, and add as much fiour 
as will make it into a paste ; if too thick, add a 
little orange-flower water. Make it into cakes 
the form you wish, and let thent bake slowly in

a moderate oven. There must be an equal 
quantity of flour and chesnuts^ and the sugar^ 
coriander seed^ and pistachios must be added by 
degrees. 

PATE AU KIZ. 

Wash some rice in several waters^ then put it 
on to stew slowly in milk for two hours till 
quite tender; then rub it through a tamis; it 
should be the consistence of good cream^ very 
thick. Take two pounds of flour, six eggs weU 
beaten, a pound of butter, a little salt, and half 
a pound of sifted sugar ; mix this lightly to a 
good paste with the rice cream, and use it for 
tarts, cakes, &c. 

If you wish to make rice flour, do it as 
follows : — 

Let the rice swell in boiling water till it has 
imbibed all the moisture, then spread it on a clean 
paste-board, spreading it out to dry thoroughly. 
If the weather is fine, put it in the sun to dry, 
turning it from time to time with a wooden spoon 
that every grain may dry equally. When quite 
dry, pound the rice in a mortar till a fine flour, 
then put it into little cloth bags to keep. When 
you use it, mix4t with common flour.

yolks of four eggs, a quarter of a pound of 
butter ; to give it a flavour, wet it well with some 
beef or veal stock, or stock made with poultry, 
game, or fish, according to taste or circum- 
stances. You must use the stock warm, rub 
the butter and salt into the flour and the eggs, 
before you mix the stock ; work it as lightly as 
possible, and it is ready for use. It is good for 
meat, fish, and game-pies. 

Great care must be taken that it does not 
bum, as it is apt to catch quickly in the oven. 

FATE AUX FOMMES DE TERRE. 

Take four or five pounds of good potatoes, 
freshly dug, wash them well, and put them on 
to boil quickly for an hour, till they begin to

peel them, and throw them asyou peel them into 
a saucepan full of boiling water ; let them boil 
again an hour, and then mash them with some 
butter to the consistence of cream ; you must stir 
them to prevent their burning; take them off 
the fire, and mix them with two pounds of flour, 
which you must shake in by degrees with your

lemon^ orange^ or citron; take a pound of flour^ 
make a hole in the middle^ rub into it a quarter 
of a pound of butter^ a little orange-flower water 
and three eggs^ a quarter of a pound of sugar^

be poured into cake-pans, and baked in a very 
slow oven a long time till crisp. 

PATE AUX AMANDES. 

• 

Take half a pound of sweet ^monds and 
twenty bitter ones; blanch them, and as you 
peel them, throw them into cold water to keep 
them white. When all are finished, strain 
them, and dry them in a napkin, then pound 
them by degrees, adding from time to time 
some orange-flower water to prevent their oiling ; 
keep the almonds covered in a napkin, or tliey

as the air makes them yellow. When all are 

pounded, if they are too wet or too oily, put 

them on the fire for a minute, adding a handful 

of sugar sifted; stir it constantly, or it will 

bum ; and when you see that the paste is dry 

enough, and does not stick to the stewpan, take 

it off; then add the yolks of six eggs, and mix 

it weU with the almonds, and more sugar if not 

sweet enough ; pour it on a pound of flour on 

the pasteboard, and mix it well with warm milk 

till a proper consistency, add some citron and 

candied lemon-peel, according to taste; let the 

paste stand half an hour, then roll it out, and 

cut it in any forms you please. If you wish to 

make it like puff paste, use melted butter, as 

you do in the p&te feuilletee. It will be more 

delicate and easier cut in different forms. The 

puff paste merits the preference, as it is lighter, 

and preserves the sweet flavour of the almonds. 

In p&te bris^e, it is best liked by persons who 

prefer crisp biscuits and the flavour of roasted 

almonds. 

PATE DE BRIOCHES. 

Take three pounds of flour, and to one of the 
pounds put about an ounce of leaven or yeast. 



CAKES^ AND BISCUITS. 13 

mix it into a paste with luke-warm water lightly, 
then lay it aside in a howl to rise, in a warm 
place, covered with a cloth in several folds, which 
heat from time to time; let it stand half an 
hour; then take the remainder of the flour, make 
a hole in the middle, and break in a dozen eggs, 
put in two pounds of butter and an ounce of 
fine salt, then uncover the paste, cut into pieces, 
and mix it with some water. Then make it into 
stiff paste, which will be rather hard work; 
when the paste is well worked, flour a bowl, put 
in the paste, and cover it over ; let it rise ten or 
twelve hours in a warm place, wrapped up in a 
cloth to keep out all the air. Divide the paste 
into pieces the size of a turkey^ s egg, give them 
a round form, put them in an iron plate, egg 
them over, and bake them in a gentle oven. 
With this paste you can make gateaux des rois, 
mirabolons, and other cakes, which will keep 
several days fresh by putting them for five 
minutes into a moderate oven. 

PATE Aux comas. 

Take a pound of preserved quinces, pound it 
in a mortar with a little cochineal dissolved in 
water, to give it a good colour ; take a pound of

and some hot water, quickly and lay it aside 
covered up in a warm place for an hour ; then 
cut it into cakes, and bake. 

PATE AUX PISTACHB8. 

This paste is much superior to that made 
with almonds. After peeling the pistachios, 
pound them in a mortar, with a little orange- 
flower water to moisten it from time to time; 
let the quantity be half a pound, add half a 
pound of sifted sugar, then mix the whole with 
a pound of flour and a quarter of a pound of 
fresh butter, or some cream, some pieces of 
candied citron, and a little yeast; when well 
mixed, let it stand, and then make into cakes. 
It can also be finished like the pate feuilletee 
with butter, and is very delicate. 

PATE A LA OBOSEILLE. 

Take some white currant jelly, or red if you 
have no white, put it on to melt, and when 
liquid and warm, pour it on some flour, adding 
some beaten eggs and a little sugar, with some 
butter, if you wish the cakes to be crisp ; if not.

leave out the butter. You may add half a pint 
of raspberry-juice to the jelly if made in summer. 
In winter, if you msh to use the juice, it must 
be preserved juice. 

PATE AtJX FBAISES ET FBAMBOISES. 

Take two pounds of raspberries, and half a 
pound of strawberries, pound them in a mortar, 
and squeeze out the juices, moisten the pulp 
with a wine-glassful of Water ; let the juice stand 
for an hour> then add three quarters of a pound 
of sugar, rub a little butter into two pounds of 
ilour, and make it into a paste with the juice ; 
let it stand for an hour in a warm place, and 
then make it into cakes. You might make this 
in the same way as the p&te feuilletee, first 
mixing the paste, rolling it out, and then adding 
the butter, folding it up four or five times, and 
rolling out again. It is lighter made in this 
way.

16 PASTE FOB TARTS, 

the juice through a cloth, but do not add any 
water to it ; with this juice moisten the paste, 
which you make in the usual way, or like the p&te 
feuilletee. Apricots are made in the same way; 
but it is best to make it with apricot marmalade. 

FATE AUX CEBISES. 

Choose the ripest cherries, and crush them in 
a pan, with some strawberries to improve the 
flavour, then let them remain five or six hours, 
and squeeze them through a linen cloth; put 
three quarters of a pound of sugar to two pounds 
of flour, and rub in half a pound of butter. Mix 
all lightly together ; let the paste stand for two 
hours, then roll it out and make it into cakes. 
A moderate oven is best for all fruit cakes. 

FATE DE FLEUE D'OBANGE. 

Pick some orange-flowers, leaf by leaf, the 
double flowers are the best, because they produce 
more juice, and give a higher flavour and per- 
fume. Throw them into boiling water, which 
must not cease boiling an instant till the flowers 
are tender enough to crush between your fingers. 
Pour the whole on a tammy for the hot water to be 
drained oflF; then pour lukewarm water on them, 
and lastly cold; as if you throw them quickly

from boiling water into cold, it makes them 
yellow. Squeeze over the flowers the juice of a 
lemon, and pour a glass of water over them. Let 
them simmer in the lemon and water two or three 
hours. Then drain them on a tammy and pound 
them immediately in a mortar, for the interval of 
a quarter of an hour will spoil the colour. Mix 
this paste with three quarters of a pound of white 
sugar, six ounces of fresh butter, and a pound of 
flour, and form your paste as usual. Or you 
may make tarts as follows : — Line your tartlet or 
tart pan with good puff paste, and fill them with 
a marmalade made with the orange paste mixed 
with some almonds pounded, and moistened with 
milk or cream ; a little lemon peel grated fine 
and some candied citron cut in pieces, but very 
little, as the flavour of the orange flowers should 
predominate. 

FATE AUX AVEUNES.

mortar half a pound of filberts, moistening them 
with cream, in which has been boiled a piece of 
candied lemon peel. Add also half a pound of

filberts pounded, and work up together into a soft 
paste ; cover it in a bowl with a warm napkin, 
four folds, and let it rise two hours ; then make 
it into cakes. 

PATE A LA BOSE. 

Choose some large deep-coloured roses, and 
pound tbem in a mortar tiU in a fine paste. Squeeze 
them through a linen cloth to extract the juice, 
they will yield plenty if you take care to gather 
them whilst the dew is on them, before the sun 
dries it up. When the juice is all extracted, at 
once make it into paste, with a pound of flour, 
three quarters of a pound of sugar, and a quarter 
of a pound of butter, half an ounce of yeast or 
leaven. When well mixed, put it into a bowl 
an hour to rise, and then make it into cakes. 

These cakes are good for those who have deli-

Take some macaroons^ very dry, and for this pur- 
pose put them in an oven for half an hour^ then 
pound a sufficient quantity to have a pound of 
powdered macaroons^ and sift them through a 
tamis. Mix this with a quart of flour^ half a 
pound of sugar^ the same of butter^ and a httle 
yeast. Mix all together into a paste with a pint 
of good milk ; let it rise for three quarters of an

let6e; but then it is better to make it into 
tartlets, and fill them with stewed pears. A 
delicious and pretty dish can be made as follows : 
cut out in forms the paste of different sizes, put 
a layer of paste, then a layer of pear marmalade, 
again paste, then marmalade, and so on, till 
raised high, and let the last layer of paste be cut 
in leaves, put it into an oven to bake ; it will 
rise very high, and resemble a Savoy cake. A

a little powdered sugar, which will facilitate the 
glazing. Line a tart-pan with paste, and bake 
it ; turn out the pears on a plate, and slip them 
quickly into the tart. Serve hot or cold. You 
might put them into the paste before it is baked

shapes^ and put on each a little white curd^ 
which you must first beat and poimd with white 
of egg, some sugar, and orange-flower water ; all 
stewed together; put a little on each piece of 
paste, and turn it over, forming it like a basket ; 
dry each^ and let them bake very gently in a 
slow oven. 

GAUEFBSS (WAEEBS). 

Take same flour, and moisten it with the 
yolks of e^s and some cream, add some sugar 
the same weight as your flour, and mix all 
together to a batter the consistence of eream. 
Warm your gau£fre4rons, grease them with 
butter; take a large spoonful of the mixture,

open your irons, and fill one side, then close 
them, and heat them, both sides ; they will be 
done in an instant. On taking them out of the 
irons, roll them hot round a wooden roller to 
give the proper shape. 

GAUFFRSS AU CTTBOK. 

Mix three quarters of a pound of flour in half 
a pint of milk with four fresh eggs, half a pound 
of powdered sugar and the peel of a candied 
lemon grated and pounded fine ; reduce this to 
a clear batter, and prepare your irons as before. 

6AUFFKES AU MALAGA.

GAS8EMAI7X. 

Found in a mortar some fresh curd^ and mix 
with it some batter, the yolks of eggs, and some 
flour, add a little yeast, and beat it well an hour 
and a half with a wooden spatula. When well 
mixed, and a good consistency, put them on tin 
plates with a small spoon, make them the size of 
a pigeon^s egg; egg them over, and let them 
bake a quarter of an hour ; they will swell very 
much, and leave an opening inside. 

It is necessary to beat this paste a long time 
to make them less heavy than they would be. 
In Normandy these are favourite cakes. A 
lemon-peel, or a few carraway-seeds make a 
change. 

CBOQUIGNOLLES. 

Mix some flour with the yolks of eggs, some 
pounded almonds, a little rose-water, and a 
very little sugar. Make a stiff paste, and cut

oven a quarter of an hour. When a good bright 
yellow, and crisp, take them out, and keep them 
in a dry place.

half a pound of sugar that has been boiled to 
the great plume ; work it well with a spoon^ then 
put it into a mould made of paper. When cold^ 
cut it into lozenges. 

CLARIFICATION OF SUGAR. 

To clarify sugar very white, beat two or three 
whites of eggs according to the quantity you 
require ; add by degrees water, to the proportion 
of a quart for each white of egg; break your 
sugar, and put it in pieces into the water ; boil 
and skim it, and then add by degrees all the 
water. When the skim is very white, your sugar 
is clarified.

out, weigh them, and boil them for a quarter of 
an hour ; put your sugar into a basin — a pound 
of sugar for a pound of fruit — ^take the quinces 
oat, and drain them, and put them in a pre- 
serving-pan on your sugar, and let them simmer 
slowly three hours on a moderate fire. Stir 
them often, but care must be taken not to break 
the quinces. 

TO PHESBKTE FLOHS WBOLS. 

Scald your plums — either greengages or 
mussel— when soft, take them up with a strainer,

then take up your plums and put them on a 
sieve to drain; then again boil your syrup^ and 
skim it clear ; put your plums in the jars you 
mean to keep them in^ and pour the syrup over 
them rather warm. 

ANOTHER WAY TO PRESERVE QUINCES. 

Get some quinces which are very ripe, peel 
them, and cut them in slices, to preserve in a 
pan j cover them well with water. When quite 
tender, pour through a tamis, which you place 
over an earthen pan ; let the juice drain, weigh 
it, and add as many pounds of sugar as you have 
juice; then hoil it to the same consistence as 
currant jelly. 

PRESERVED PEARS. 

Take three pounds of sugar for six pounds of 
fruit, peel and quarter them, take out the cores, 
put them into a bowl, with the sugar strewed 
over them, and let them remsdn twenty-four 
hours, then put them on to simmer for three 
hours, with the rind of two lemons; let them 
remain ten minutes, take them off, and add the 
juice of two lemons. 



72 PRESERVES. 

PRESERVED PLUMS. 

Take some Reine Claude or Mirabelle plams^ 
take out the kernels^ put them on the fire in a 
preserving.pan, with three quarters of a pound 
of sugar for each pound of fruit ; stir them till 
done enough. To try this, put a bit on a plate^ 
press your finger on it^ andif^ in taking it away, it 
leaves a string on your finger^ it is done enough. 

You must break the stones, take out the 
kernels, and put them in hot water to take off 
the skin, and mix the kernels a few minutes 
before you take it off. 

PRESERVED CHERRIES. 

Take fifteen pounds of ripe cherries, free from 
defects ; take the stones out, and cut off the 
stalks ; take two pounds of currants and one of 
raspberries, squeeze out the juice, and add the 
cherries in the preserving-pan ; boil them on a 
quick fire; add three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar to each pound of fruit ; let it simmer an 
hour, and then put the jam into pots. 

CONFITURE DE MIRABELLES. 

Make a syrup in a preserving-pan, a wine- 
glassful of water for each pound of fruit, and 



PRESERVESr^ 73 

three quarters of a pound of sugar; clear the 
syrup with the whites of one or two eggs^ beaten 
with a glass of water^ and skim clear. Put in 
your plums whole without stoning^ having first 
pricked them with a needle. They will be done 
enough when they are tender to the touch. 

Preserve apricots and peaches in the same 
manner^ first dividing them and taking out the 
stones. Use a pound of sugar to every pound of 
fruit. 

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES. 

Take as m^ny pounds of sugar as you have 
fruit; make a clear, strong syrup; let it cool, 
and then put it into a preserving-pan with the 
strawberries ; let them boil ten minutes, and put 
them into glass jars or pots ; cover them with 
syrup, and next day cover them with brandy 
papers first, and then leather or bladder. You 
must cut off the stalks, and take care the fruit 
is not bruised or too ripe. It should be full- 
sized fruit. 

Sometimes add some currant juice to colour 
the syrup : many think it improves the flavour 
as well, as the sharpness of the currant-juice 
takes off the cloying sweet of the strawberries.

TO DRY PLUMS. 

Take the large yellow Mogul or greengage 
plums, and choose fine ones; put them into a 
flat pan, first pricking them well with a fine 
needle; fill the pan with water, and put it on a 
very slow fire ; take care that the skin does not 
come off. When they are tender, take them up, 
and to every pound of fruit put a pound of 
sugar ; strew a little at the bottom of a large flat 
pan, put your plums in singly, in rows, with 
sugar over each, and cover them with the 
remainder of the sugar. Put them into the 
oven all night ; increase the heat the next day ; let 
them cool, and again put them into a cool oven, 
turning them every day. Repeat this for four days ; 
then drain them from the syrup, and put them on 
plates to dry before the fire, or in the sun. 

DRIED PEACHES. 

Take some fine ripe peaches, pare them, and 
put them into water as you finish them ; take an 
equal weight of sugar, with half, make a thin 
syrup, into which put your peaches, boiling them 
till they look clear ; then spUt and stone them. 
Boil them till they are very tender, drain them 
on a sieve. Take the other part of the sugar, 
and boil it almost to candy ; then put in your 



76 BmiED Fftrns. 

peacheSy and let them ranam in the sjmp for 
two dajB; then lay them on dishes, and put 
them in a store till they are dry. 

Let the first syrup be veiy thin: a quart of 
water to a poond ol sugar. 

DRIED DAXSOKS. 

Take four pounds of damsons, and put them 
into a syrop made with a pound of sugar and 
a pint of water ; let them stand in the hot syrup 
on a gentle fire for half an hour, then put them 
into a pan, coTer them, and let them stand till 
next day ; drain off the syrop and boQ it, then 
pour it OTer the damsons : do this fi>r three days, 
then drain them, and lay them in an earthen 
dish, and put them into a cool oven for some 
hours; then turn them, and put them in the 
sun, or a cool oven, or before a fire, till diy ; 
then pack them in boxes for use, with paper 
between each layer. 

TO DRT CHERRIBS. 

Take six pounds of cherries, stone them, and 
put them in a preserving-pan, with three pounda 
of white sugar and a pint of water; then set 
them on the fire till they are scalding hot; then 
take them off, and put them into a basin to 
cool. The next day boil them till they are 



DRIED FRUITS. 11 

tender^ skimming clear ; sprinkle half a pound of 
sugar over them^ and let them stand in the 
syrup three days ; drain them on a sieve^ taking 
them out separately^ and put them in a cool 
oven to dry, turning them occasionally till dry 
enough. Then put a sheet of white paper round 
a preserving-pan^ put your cherries in with 
another sheet of paper over them^ cover them, 
and put them on a cool fire till they warm ; then 
take them off, and when cold, put them in 
boxes or jars to keep, with white paper between 
them. 

ANOTHER METHOD. 

To four pounds of cherries put one pound of 
sugar, dipping each lump in water to wet it, 
but not more water than will wet the sugar. 
When melted, and it boils, put in your cherries, 
having first stoned them ; let them boil a few 
minutes, skim them clear, take them off, and let 
them stand in the syrup two days ; then boil the 
syrup, and add about half a pound of sugar to it 
before you boil up the syrup, and pour it boiling 
hot over the cherries ; let them stand four days 
in the syrup, and then drain them on sieves, 
and put them to dry in the sun, or in a cool 



78 DRIED mum. 

oven. When dry, put them in boxes in layers, 
with white paper between them. 

ANOTHBB METHOD. 

Stone four ponnds of cherries, and lay them 
in a basin separately, sprinkling a pound of 
white sugar over each layer ; let them stand till 
the following day, then put them into a pre- 
serving-pan, and place them on the fire; let 
them boil a quarter of an hour, and then put 
them into a basin with their syrup; let them 
stand in it three days, then take them out, and 
place them on hair sieves to drain, and place 
them in the sun to dry, or before a slow fire, or 
in a cool oven. It must be very cool: only 
sufficient heat to feel when you put your hand 
in. When dry, pack in boxes as before. 

TO PRESERVE CHERRIES WITH STALKS AND LEAVES. 

First dip the stalks and leaves into vinegar, 
boiling hot, then stick them in a sieve till dry ; 
have ready some syrup, and scald the cherries, 
stalks and leaves in it ; take them out and let 
them cool; boil the syrup to a candy height, 
then dip the cherries, stalks and leaves, in; 
let them be taken up separately in a spoon with 



DBIBD FBUIT8. 79 

holes in it; lay them on sieves, and dry them 
as before directed. 

These cherries look very well in clear jellies, or 
mixed with other glace fruit in the piece mont^ 
you have as a centre piece. Any other fruit, 
such as currants, grapes, plums, can be done in 
the same manner. 

TO PRESERVE CHERRIES. 

Take two pounds of cherries, stone them; 
with a pound and a half of sugar, and half a pint 
of water make a good syrup; put in your 
cherries, let them boil gently till all the sugar 
is melted ; then boil them fast and skim them ; 
take them o£f two or three times, and shake 
them round ; put them on again, and let them 
boil fast. When they are of a good colour, and 
the syrup will stand, they are done enough. 
Put them into pots or bottles, and when cold, 
paper them. 

ANOTHEE METHOD — ^VEEY GOOD. 

Take an equal quantity of sugar and fruit 
before the cherries are stoned; make your syrup, 
and after stoning the cherries, put them in ; let 
them boil slowly at first, till they are thoroughly 
heated, then boil as fast as you can ; when clear. 



80 D&IED FBtriTS. 

add some carrant-juice : this improves the colour 
and flavour. 

APRICOTS. 

Fare and stone the apricots, take an equal 
quantity of sugar^ pound and sift it^ put the 
apricots in a bowl^ and strew the sugar over 
them ; let them stand till the next day ; then 
put them into a preserving-pan^ set them on a 
gentle fire^ and let them simmer a Uttle ; then 
let them boil till tender and clear; take them 
occasionally to skim and turn ; keep them under 
the syrup as much as possible when boilings 
and when done enough^ take them up^ and put 
them in glasses. Boil your syrup again^ and 
skim it clear, and when cold, pour it over the 
apricots. Put paper over them, steeped first in 
brandy, and tie them down closely with leather 
or bladder, or paste the cover on, which is the 
best. 

ANOTHEB MODE. 

Fare your apricots, and scoop out the stones, 
scald them in water, take an equal weight of 
sugar to the quantity of fruit : with some of the 
water — ^if not too much, the whole — ^and make a 
syrup with it ; skim it clear ; when the synxp 



OBIED FRUITS. 81 

jellies, it is done enough. Scald your apricots 
in it, put them into jars, pour the syrup over 
them, and when cold, paper them as before. 

DBIED APRICOTS. 

After paring and stoning them, take an equal 
quantity of sugar and fruit, put the fruit and 
sugar into layers; the next day pour o£f the 
syrup, and boil it up ; but first put a wine-glass- 
ful of water in. When the syrup boils, put in the 
fruit and let them boil up, then put them to cool 
in the syrup; in three days scald them again, 
adding a little water. If the syrup is too thick, 
let them again stand for a couple of days, then 
scald them again, and if clear, take them up, 
and drain them on a sieve, dry them before a 
fire, or in a very cool oven, aniwhen quite dr^, 
put them in boxes in layers, with paper between 
them. 

ANOTHER MODE, WHOLE. 

Pare your apricots, and prick them well with 
a fine needle ; have equal quantities of fruit and 
sugar. Make a thin syrup with part of the 
sugar, scald the fruit in this, and take them off 
to cool. The next day, again boil up the syrup, 
adding more sugar; scald the apricots again, 

G 



82 viEiED nurm. 

then pat them aside far two days; repeat the 
faoiUng up four times^ adding the sagar tiU all 
is used. The last time;, let them remain in the 
syrap three days, and then drain them ont of the 
syrap, and pat them on a sieve to dry as before ; 
and when quite dry, pack them in layers, with 
paper between, in boxes. These will be very 
good if carefully done. 

GSBENGAeES AND MIBABELLE FLUMS* 

Dip the stalks and leaves — ^if you choose to 
have leaves — ^in boiling vinegar to keep them 
green ; but I prefer them without leaves. When 
they are dry, have a good syrup ready, and scald 
your fruit ; then with a silver knife remove the 
skin carefully ; boil your sugar to candy height, 
and dip in your plums several times, letting 
them cool between each time ; then drain tbem 
s^tiirough a sieve and dry them; hang some of 
them up by the stalk to dry, and a clear drop of 
candy will be on the plum ; but this is a matter 
of taste. Be careful to keep your syrup very 
clear. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Remove the skins with a silver knife, and 
prick the plums all over ; let them be full grown 



DRIED FRUITS. 83 

but not ripe. Make a strong syrup^ m which 
scald the plums; let them be put in a bowl 
aside in the syrup for two or three days ; then 
scald them again^ and again put them by for 
two days ; the third time add a little more sugar^ 
and when the plums have come to a boil^ and 
look clear^ take them off the fire and remove the 
plums separately in a spoon with holes in it ; then 
lay them on a sieve to dry in a cool oven, or 
before the fire. When dry, pack them in boxes, 
with paper between each layer. 

DRIED FEARS. 

Peel your pears, and throw them into cold 
water in a preserving-pan ; put them on to boil 
till tender ; then take them out with a strainer, 
and put them into cold water to cool; take them 
out and drain them, and put for every half-hun- 
dred of pears one pound of sugar to two pints of 
water. When it has melted put in your pears, 
and let them remain three or four hours in the 
syrup; then put them in cullenders or cheese 
vats, the stalk uppermost, and let them remain 
in a cool oven all night. The next day put them 
again in the syrup, and at night drain and put 
them into the oven ; repeat this process of alter- 

o 2 



84 FBESBBVBB. 

nately steeping and putting them into the oven 
for four days^ and the last time they will be quite 
dry. Pack them in bozes^ with layers of paper 
between them. 

CONFITUBES AU MIEL. 

Choose some good honey ; clarify it by boiling 
and skimming it till clear. Let it get cold, and 
then use it for preserves in place of sugar. You 
must use a third more in making them than you 
would sugar. 

MOGUL, OK KAONUM BONUH PLUMS. 

Take two pounds of plums to one pound of 
sugar; stone them^ and fill them with sugar; 
lay them in an earthen pan ; add as much water 
as will prevent their burnings and put them into 
a moderate oven. Let them stand till they are 
tender^ then drain them on a sieve from the 
syrup^ and again put them in an oven to dry a 
little; then smooth the skins as smooth as 
possible^ and fill them with pulp prepared as 
follows : 

Take some plums, prick them, and put them 
into an earthen jar, which set in a bain maree ; 
let them stew till tender; then pour o£f the syrup, 



PBBSEBTES. 85 

remove the skins and stones^ and pulp the fruit ; 
to every pint of pulp add a pound of sugar ; let 
it boil till the scum rises, which take oflF very 
clean ; put the pulp into an oven to dry a little, 
and then fill the plums in the cavities of the 
stones. When filled, put the plums into an oven 
to harden. Diy them well, and when dry, pack 
them in boxes. These plums look well for a 
desert or supper. 

MOGUL PLUMS. 

Take the finest, and clearest from specks you 
can get ; to each pound of fruit put a pound 
and a quarter of sugar, and a pint of water ; slit 
the plums, and stone them, prick them with a 
fine needle, sift some of the sugar, and shake it 
over the plums, as you lay them in a pan, till 
all are done ; have ready a thin syrup, cold ; put 
in your plums with the slit side down ; let them 
boil gently, often removing them from the fire 
and shaking them round; skim them well, and 
take care to have them covered with the syrup, 
or they will lose their colour; when they are 
thoroughly scalded, strew on the rest of the sugar, 
and continue doing so till they are done enough, 
which you will know by their glazing ; towards 



86 PBESBBVEa. 

the end boil them quickly^ and when done put 
them in jars for use. 

AP&ICOTS OK PLUMS^ 6BEEN. 

Take your fruit before they have stones in 
them^ which you will know by sticking a pin 
into them ; then let them scald in several waters 
till they are quite green; peel them and scald 
them again; take an equal weight of sugar as 
fruity and make a syrup^ then put them in and 
let them boil slowly till they are clear^ skimming 
them often; they will be very green if care is 
taken. Put them in glasses for use, cover 
them with syrup, and when cold put brandy 
papers over them, and cover them with 
leather. 

MAS3£ALAD£ D^APEICOT. 

Feel your apricots, take out the stones, crack

of fruit, clarify three pounds of sugar ; let it boil 
to the grand boulet, which you will know by 
putting your strainer into the sugar, taking it 
out, and blowing under, the sugar flies oflF; then 
put in your apricots, and let them boil, stirring 
them constantly with a wooden spatul^ tiU it

and when cold, paper like other preserves. 

ANOTHEK AFBICOT MABMALADE. 

Cut very fine six pounds of apricots^ which 
mnst be very ripe^ and put them into a preserving- 
pan; break the stones^ take out the kernels, 
blanch them, add them to the apricots ; pound 
four pounds and a half of sugar, and mix it with 
your apricots ; put your preserving-pan on a clear 
fire, and stir your fruit to prevent its sticking to 
the pan ; as the apricots boil, crush them fine 
till it is a marmalade ; when done enough, put it 
into pots as before. 

CUJftBANT JELLY. 

Clarify your sugar, and put a pint of currant 
juice to a pound of sugar ; let it boil up twice, pass 
it through a tamis, and put it in your pots. The 
sugar must be boiled first to the grande lisse. 

CUEBANT JELLY A LA BOUBOEOISE. 

Clarify your sugar. Put the currants into a 
preserving-pan, and put it on the fire; let it boil 
till the juice draws : then strain it through a 
tamis, measure yom* currant juice, and put an 



88 FKX8BBTE8. 

equal quantity of clarified sugar with it that has 
boiled to the grande lisse ; let both boil together. 
Skim well and put in pots. 

APPLE JELLY. 

This is made much the same as the currant 
jelly, with this difference, you must draw the 
juice of the apples by boiling them in water, and 
straining it through a linen doth; squeeze it a 
little, and strain the juice again to boil with the 
sugar ; finish like the former receipt. Tov know 

« 

when it is done, raise your strainer, and if the 
jelly falls in pearls it is done enough ; then put 
it in pots. You may sometimes add codiineal to 
colour it. 

BAEBEKRY JELLY

PLUM MAS.MALADE. 

Stone your plums, and boil them with a little 
water till they are a marmalade; pass them 
through a tamis, and put them again on the fire 
to simmer ; when it is about to stick to the pan, 
have some sugar, the same weight as you have of 
fruit, boiled into a strong syrup to the grande 
lisse; then mix this with the marmalade, stirring 
it on the fire till it simmers ; when it is cool put 
it into pots and strew sugar over it.

CONPITURB DB PKUNES. 

Take some fine plums^ such as Mirabelles^ 
greengages^ Beine Claude^ and let them boil up ; 
when they feel soft^ take them up with a strainer^ 
and put them into cold water. Clarify five 
pounds of sugar for a hundred large plums ; put 
the fruit one by one into a bowl, so that they 
might not be crushed, and pour your syrup luke- 
warm over them ; repeat this twice a day for five 
days ; then take out the plums, and drain them 
on a tamis, and boil up the syrup, put the fruit 
into the jars, and pour the syrup over them luke- 
warm. Your plums should be a good colour, 
the Reine Claudes green. At the end, if you 
have too much syrup, reduce it ; if too little, add 
some fresh sugar, with a little water to wet it, and 
pour it boiling hot over the plums.

drain and pound them sufficiently to rub through 
a tamis ; put this marmalade on the fire, and 
stir it till it is beginning to stick to the pan ; 
then weigh it^ put the same weight of sugar 
with half a pint of water on the fire; boil it 
to the petite lisse ; then add the marmalade ; let 
it simmer till well mixed, without boiling, and 
put it into pots. 

KARMALADE BE FBAMBGISES. 

Pick and wash half a poimd of raspberries, 
drain, and rub them through a tamis, to form 
the marmalade ; put on the fire a pound of sugar 
with a glass of water ; let it boil up ; skim it, 
and let the syrup boil to the grande plume ; then 
add your fruit ; mix well together, stirring it on 
the fire without letting it boil ; take it o£f and 
fill small pots with it. 

This receipt is too sweet for most tastes; 
half the quantity of sugar or some currant juice 
added to it is better. 

MABHALADE DE FBAISES. 

Prepare your syrup as before for the rasp- 
berries. When at the point of boiling, put in 



' I 



92 FKEaEBTBS. 

your strawberries^ prepared as follows : Pick twd 
pounds of strawberries^ and pass them through 
a tamis to form the marmalade ; put it on the 
fire to dry a little till about to stick to the pre-

the syrup ; let it boil up a few times^ and put it 
in your pots. 

MABMALADE DE CEBISES. 

Boil your syrup as before^ two pounds of sugar 
and a glass of water ; let it boil to the grande 
lisse; then add four pounds of cherries^ after 
stoning and cutting o£f the stalks. Stir them 
well with the syrup^ and let them boil together 
till the syrup is well mixed with the fruit; it 
requires longer boiling than any other fruity and 
the sugar is too little for most tastes. Three 
quarters to each pound of fruit will have a nicer 
flavour. 

OBANOE MAJELMALADE. 

Take the finest Seville orauges^ and cut them

change the water three times whilst boiling; 
then pound the rind and add the juice and pulp ; 



PBESEBVES. 98 

put all into a preserving-pan with double the 
quantity of sugar; set it on the fire to boil very 
gently forty minutes, then put it into pots for 
use. Some prefer parts of the rind cut in chips 
and simmered with the marmalade, 

TO PKBSEEVE ORANGES WHOLE. 

Lay your oranges in water for three days, 
changing it every day ; then put them in a pre- 
serving-pan to boil slowly in water for seven or 
eight hours ; keep adding hot water as it boils 
away. The oranges must be boiled until tender 
enough for a straw to pierce them; then take 
them out and scoop out the pulp and seeds; 
weigh them, and to every pound of oranges add 
a pound and three quarters of sugar ; fill your 
oranges with sugar and strew some over them, 
and set them aside whilst you make your jelly 
thus: Take a dozen of pippins or any other 
baking apple, slice them, put them into water, 
and when they are boiled, strain the liquor from 
the pulp. To every pound of oranges you must 
use a pint and a half of this liquor, and put 
to it the third of the sugar left after filling the 
oranges; set it on the fire, let it boil and strain 
it well, then put it by till cold; then put it into 



94 PSESEBVES; 

the preserving-pan with your oranges; keep 
them as much as possible imder the syrap as it 
boils, to let all parts be equally done; strew iu 
the remains of the sugar whilst the oranges are 
boiling, and when they are clear take them and 
put them in glasses or small jars ; and when the 
syrup is boiled to almost a jelly, fill your glasses; 
when cold, paper and cover. Keep them in a dry 
place. 

ANOTHEB. MODE. 

Cut a hole out of the stalk end of your oranges 
as big as sixpence ; scoop out all the pulp and 
tie them singly in muslin and lay them in water 
for two days, changing the water twice a day; 
boil them in the muslin till tender; be careful to 
keep them covered with the water when boiling, 
that every part shall be boiled alike. Weigh the 
oranges before you scoop them ; to every pound 
add two pounds of sugar and a pint of water; 
boil the sugar and water with the orange juice to 
a syrup, skim it well, let it stand till cold ; take 
the oranges out of the muslin, put them in the 
syrup, and boil till they are clear, then put them 
aside till cold; then pare and boil some green 
pippins, and boil them till they have a strong

flavour of the pippin; do not stir them^ pnt them 
down gently with a spoon^ and strain the liquor 
through a jelly-bag till it is clear : put to every 
pint of the liquor a pound of sugar and the juice 
of a lemon strained as clear as possible^ boil it to 
a strong jelly; drain the oranges out of the 
syrup and put them into jars or glasses; pour 
the jelly over them^ and^ when cold^ cover them 
with brandy papers first, and afterwards tie leather 
over them. 

Lemons can be preserved in the same manner. 
A strong syrup, made clear, of sugar and water 
alone, or with the juice added, and strained when 
boiling, first through a jelly-bag, answers equally 
well, and some prefer it to the apple jelly. This 
is left to taste. 



CAKES. 

RICH PLUM CAKE. 



Take two pounds of flour, two pounds of white 
sugar, a quarter of an ounce of mace pounded 
and sifted, a nutmeg grated. To each pound of 
flour add eight eggs; wash and pick two pounds 
of currants, dry them before the fire, blanch half 
a pound of sweet almonds and cut them in thin 



96 



I, a quarter of a pound of citron^ two ounces 
of candied lemon-peel, the same of orange-peel, 
and two glasses of Inrandy. First, beat your 
batter to a cream with your hand; then beat in 
your sugar a quarter of an hour ; then beat the 
whites of the eggs to a strong finoth, and mix 
them with your sugar and batter; beat your 
yolks half an hour at least, and mix them with 
the cake; then put in the flour and spice, keep 
beating it till the oven is ready; put in the 
brandy, and then, lastly, the currants, almonds, 
and sweetmeats ; tie three sheets of paper round 
the bottom of your hoop to keep it from running 
out; rub it weU with butter, put in your cake, 
and after it has risen, put paper on the top. It 
will take three hours to bake it well ; then stick a 
knife in, if it comes out dean it is baked enough. 
Some put the sweetmeats in three layers between 
the cake, but this depends on taste. Ice it well 
when cold with sugar mixed with white of egg, 
and dry in a cool oven or before a fire. It must 
be iced twice over. 

SEED CAKE. 

Take two pounds of flour and a pound and a 
half of white sugar, pounded and sifted. Mix 
them well together and put them before the fire 



CAKES. 97 

to dry^ till you prepare the other materials. Take 
two pounds of butter^ beat it with your hand till 
it is a soft cream^ it will take about an hour ; 
th^i beat eighteen eggs^ leaving out eight whites^ 
strain the eggs and beat them well with the 
butter; the yolks and whites must be beaten 
separately. Add some orange-flower water and 
a glass of brandy^ and beat again ; then take the 
flour and sugar; mix with them three ounces of 
caraway seeds; strew in by degrees till all is 
mixed^ beating it all the time^ about two hours it 
ought to be beaten ; butter your hoop, paper the 
bottom, and let it bake three hours in a mode- 
rate oven. Candied citron^ lemon, and orange- 
peel can be added^ cut in thin slices. 

ICING FOE CAKES. 

Put a pound of very fine sifted sugar into a 
basin, and the whites of three eggs ; beat up the 
sugar and eggs with a spoon till very thick and 
white, the more it is beaten the whiter and thicker 
it will become ; when done enough put it over 
the cake with a spoon and smooth it with a knife, 
put it to dry before a fire; then put a second 
coatings and ornament according to your taste. 



98 GAKSS. 

Put on the ornaments or bonbons before the 
icing is dry. 

SPONGE CAKES. 

Take fourteen ounces of fine flour dried and 
sifted^ a pound of sugar sifted through a lawn 
sieve or silk^ and the rinds of two lemons grated ; 
put a deep pan on a slow stove or before the fire, 
so as to make the pan quite hot ; break in twelve 
eggs and whisk them till the eggs become quite 
white and thick; then put in the sugar, and 
whisk it very well for five minutes, then let it 
stand whilst the pans are buttering ; again beat 
the eggs for about five minutes, then put in the 
flour and lemon-peel, take out the whisk and mix 
the batter with a spoon ; fill your pan or little 
moulds, put them on a baking-sheet, sift a little 
sugar over them and put them into the oven — it 
ought to be very quick. They will bake in a few 
minutes if in small moulds, or if baked as a cake, 
about an hour. This batter is also used to make 
Naples^ biscuits. The flavour naight be varied by 
using vanilla, and putting some candied citron or 
lemon-peel, cut thin, into the cake. 

ANOTHER KECIPE FOR SPONGE CAKB — FRENCH. 

Take ten eggs, separate carefally the whites 



CAKES. 99 

from the yolks^ put the yolks into a bowl with 
one pound of sugar and the rind of one lemon^ 
wiiieh must be ^ted on the sugar before 
pounding; beat it well together, and add half a 
pound of potato flour. Have the whites of the 
eggs beaten in a separate basin to the consistency 
to bear the weight of a shilling ; mix them with 
the other ingredients, all tide time beating with 
a silver fork. Have a buttered mould ready, 
dust sugar over it ; put in your cake, taking care 
not to fill the pans more than half full, as the 
cake rises very much; place the cakes into a 
gentle oven. When the cake begins to brown, 
and appears to be sufficiently done, take it out 
of the oven, and turn out of the mould.

This is very good for indigestion, or any pains 
in the stomach, or giddiness that proceeds from 
bilious affections. It is a good stomachic. 

EA.TIPIA BE NOYAUX BT DE OBAINES. 

Take a pound of the kernels of apricots and 
infuse them in two pints of brandy, a pint of 
water, one pound of sugar, half an ounce of 
coriander-seeds, and some cinnamon, for a week ; 
then strain it off and bottle for use. All ratifias 
are made the same way. 

BATIFIA d'aNIS. 

To make two quarts of aniseed ratifia, boil 
a pound of sugar with half a pint of water ; let 
it boil, and skim clear. Put three ounces of 
aniseed into half a pint of boiling water ; let it 
infuse a quarter of an hour, and add it to the 
sugar, with three pints of brandy. Shake all 
together, and put it into a jar. Cork it up, and 
place it in the sun; let it infuse three weeks. 
Strain and filter it before you bottle it. 



126 BATIPIA8. 

RATIFIA D£ GENIEVRE. 

To make three pints of ratifia de genievre^ put 
in ajar a quart of brandy^ with a good handful of 
juniper-berries, and a pound and a half of sugar, 
which must first be made into a clear syrup. 
Cork the jar closely, and put it in a warm place 
for about five weeks ; then strain and filter it ; 
when very clear, bottle and cork closely. This 
ratifia is a good stomachic, and will keep a long 
time. 

JIATIFIA D£ BIGABADES OU CTTBOXS. 

Both are made in the same manner. 

Take either eight lemons, or eight Seville 
oranges, peel them very thin, taking care not to 
cut any of the white skin, cut the rinds into 
small pieces, and put them into a jar with three 
pints of brandy, and let them infuse three weeks. 
Make a syrup with a pound of sugar and half a 
pint of water ; have it very clear, and when cold, 
put it into a jar with the brandy ; let all infuse 
a fortnight ; then strain for use, bottle it, and 
cork closely. It will keep for years. 

ANOTHEB RATIFIA D£ FLEUB D^GBANOES. 

Put in a jar three quarters of a pound of 



RATIPIAS. 127 

orange-flowers^ three pints of water, two pints of 
brandy, and a pound and a half of sngar. Cork 
the jar, and put it into a kettle full of water, and 
let it boil ten hours ; then let it cool in the bottle 
before you strain it. 

ANOTHEE MODE. 

Boil a pound of sugar with a glass of water 
and skim it ; let it boil to a perle, take it off the 
fire, and put into it half a pound of orange- 
flowers ; let it boil up two or three times in the 
syrup; then take it off the fire and cover it 
closely. Let it stand five or six hours, and put 
it on the fire again with a pint of brandy. Let 
it warm on the fire till the brandy is mixed with 
the syrup, then strain and bottle it. You can 
make any quantity you choose by attending to 
the foregoing propcnrtions. You can preserve 
the orange-flowers, after making your ratifia, as 
follows : When you have squeezed them dry, take 
half a pound of sugar and put it into a pre- 
serving-pan with a very little water ; boil, and 
skim it clear, and let it continue to boil to the 
petite plume; then add the orange-flowers, and 
let them boil gently some time. Take them off 
the fire, and stir them till the sugar is almost in 



128 RATIPIAS. 

powder ; poor it on a tamis^ taking care to have 
something beneath^ not to lose the sugar which 
passes through. Then put the orange-jSowers 
in a jar closely covered, and keep them in a dry 
place. They will be useful for creams and every- 
thing where orange-flowers are used. 

EATIFIA DE NOIX. 

When the nuts are formed, take a dozen, split 
them in half, and put them in a jar, with three 
pints of brandy; cork the jar closely, and let 
them infuse in a cool place six weeks, shaking 
the jar occasionally ; then make a syrup with a 
pound of sugar and half a pint of water, boil 
and skim it, strain the brandy through a napkin, 
and add the sugar with a little cinnamon, some 
coriander-seeds, and let them infuse a month ; 
strain and filter before you bottle it. Cork 
closely. 

BATIFIA DE GOING. 

Take some fine ripe quinces, peel and remove 
the cores, then squeeze the juice through a cloth ; 
measure the juice, add a quart of brandy to 
three pints of the juice, a quarter of a pound 
of sugar to each pint, some cinnamon, coriander- 



BATIFIAS. 129 

aeeds^ ginger^ and mace in moderate quantities. 
Let all infuse ten or twelve days. Cork the jar 
diosely in which the ratifia is^ to exclude all the 
air; then strain the ratifia^ and filter it clear. 
Bottle it for use, and keep it in a cool place. The 
older this ratifia is, the better it will be. 

LEMON EATIFIA. 

Peel thin one or two lemons, avoiding all the 
white part, and put the rind into a bottle to 
infuse with a quart of brandy or whisky; add 
some sugar — about a quarter of a pound — and a 
little ginger. This is good for puddings or 
creams. 

SASFBEBAY BATIFIA 

Is made in the same manner as the currant, 
using less spice ; and finish the same way. 

CHEERY RATIPIA, OR BOUNCE, 

Is made the same way, only adding the ker- 
nels of the cherries to the brandy when in- 
fusing. 

ANOTHEB MODE, 

Is to take some large black or Morello cherries, 
prick them all over, and put them to steep in

130 BATIFIAS. 

brandy for a months then strain them^ squeezing 
out all the juice ; add the spice as before if liked^ 
or without^ according to taste ; put the kernels 
and half a pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit and quart of spirit; let all infuse another 
month, shaking it occasionally ; then strain and 
bottle for use. 

Some persons dip the sugar into water to melt 
it before putting it into the brandy. I prefer the 
sugar either finely pounded or made into a 
strong syrup with the least possible quantity of 
water, as it mixes better. The syrup must be 
cold before it is added to the brandy. 

EA.TIPIA OF QUINCES. ANOTHER MODE. 

Take some ripe quinces, scrape them to the 
core, let the pulp remain four-and-twenty hours, 
then squeeze the juice through a cloth, mix the 
juice with an equal quantity of brandy, add to 
each quart a quarter of a pound of sugar and 
some cinnamon. In two months, strain and filter 
for use j then bottle it. 

RATIFIA D^ANGELIQUE. 

Strip the leaves off some stalks of angelica, 
cut them into strips, and put the strips into 



LIQUEURS, 131 

branches^ with one-fourth of water ; add sugar, 
cloves, and a little cinnamon, let all infuse six 
weeks, then strain and filter for use. Put four 
quarts of brandy, four pounds of sugar, and two 
quarts of water, to a pound of angelica. 



LIQUEURS. 

ANISEED. 

Infuse half a pound of green aniseed in six 
pints of brandy, with the peel of two or three 
lemons, and a little cinnamon. Let it infuse a 
month, strain it, add three pints of water and 
three pounds of clarified sugar; filter, and bottle 
for use. Cork closely. 

EAU DE CERISES, GROSEILLES, FRAMBOISES. 

Take either cherries, currants, raspberries, 
strawberries, or mulberries. To each pound of 
fruit add a pint of water ; squeeze the fruit, and 
mix the juice with the water ; strain it through a 
bag, and add sugar to taste, and again strain it. 
This is very pleasant to mix with water in sum- 
mer, or at balls. You can ice it or cool it by 
putting the bottle in cold water an hour or 
two before you use it. It will answer for ices, 

K 2 



132 LIQUEURS. 

CASSIS. 

Take some black currants^ prick tfaem^ and 
half fill your bottles with the fruit ; add sugar 
to taste^ a few cloves^ and some cinnamon. 
Let them steep two months^ then strain off the 
juice^ and squeeze the currants to extract the 
whole. Filter for use — ^blotting-paper is best for 
filtering. If you like, the currants may be left 
in the spirit. 

MUSCAT. 

Take some ripe Muscatelle grapes, crush them, 
and strain the juice ; add some sugar made into 
syrup, brandy, and cinnamon. Let all infuse for 
twelve days, filter, and bottle for use. 

NOYAU. 

Infuse some apricot or peach kernels, cut in 
pieces, in pale brandy, shake the jar occasionally, 
melt some sugar in water, strain the brandy &om 
the kernels, add the sugar and water to it, then 
filter, and bottle for use. 

CUBACOA. 

Take some candied Seville orange chips, and 
infuse in brandy, and put it in a jar; add a 



LIQUEURS. 133 

blade or two of mace and a small bit of cinna- 
mon^ let all infuse a months then pour it off^ and 
bottle it. The chips will answer for common 
uses afterwards; if not sweet enough^ add a 
little clarified sugar; or take a Seville orange, 
squeeze the juice on sugar, boil the peel to take 
off the bitterness, in two or three waters ; let it 
infuse in brandy — a quart to two oranges — a 
month or six weeks, then add half a pound of 
sugar boiled to a clear syrup, shake the jar occa- 
sionally to mix the sugar. In a month, filter and 
bottle for use. 

The bitter curacoa, recommended as a sto- 
machic, is made with the Seville orange-peel 
without boiling, infusing some cloves and mace. 
Finish as in the former receipt. 

GINGEE LIQUEUE. 

Take some currants, the proportion of a pound 
for a quart of brandy or whisky, steep the cur- 
rants; after picking, washing, and draining them 
quite dry, let them infuse three days, then strain 
them through a tamis, and put them into a jar 
with the spirits; add an ounce of powdered 
ginger for each quart; throw into a muslin 
bag the rind of a lemon and half a pound of 



134 LIQUEURS. 

sugar; let all infuse six weeks or two months^ 
then strain off^ and filter for use. The jar must 
be occasionally well shaken to mix the sugar. 
It is preferable to make a strong syrup with the 
sugar before you add it to the brandy^ as it 
mixes better and is richer. 



CHEEEY BRANDY. 

Put your black cherries^ after cutting off the 
stalks^ into a jar to draw the juice^ strain them, 
when tender^ through a tamis^ only leaving 
behind the skins and kernels. For every quart 
of juice, add three pints of brandy and three 
quarters of a pound of sugar. Make the sugar 
into a strong syrup, with a small wine-glass of 
water; let it boil up, and skim it, and when 
cold, add it to the brandy and juice ; shake well 
together to mix, crack the kernels, and add them 
to the spirit ; pat them into the jar, add a stick 
of cinnamon, a few cloves and a little mace, and 
let them all infuse six weeks or two months, 
shaking occasionally, so that all might be well 
mixed together, then strain it off, and filter. 
Bottle for use. The older this is, the finer it 
will be. 



WHIPPED CREAMS. 135 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Take some fine Morello cherries, prick them 
all over, and put them to infuse in brandy; 
after a week, take them up, and squeeze them 
through a tamis to extract the juice, then add 
sugar to taste ; or the cherries might be left for 
six weeks or more, and in place of squeezing, 
they may be served at dessert ; but, in this case, 
some cherry juice must be added. 

R«pZi ..d c™„u », be infu-ed i» 
brandy, but the juice must be drawn first, and 
added with some whole fruit, and a few cloves 
and cinnamon to taste. 



WHIPPED CREAMS. 

In winter you use syrups — ^in summer, the 
juice of fresh fruit; and I shall give a few 
plain directions for the use of private fami- 
lies : — 

EAU DE CEBISE, CURRANTS, &C., POR ICES. 

Take cherries, currants, raspberries, straw- 
berries, mulberries, &c. For a pound of fruit, 



136 WHIPPED C1IEAX8. 

take a pint of water^ crush your firuit^ and mix 
it with the water; squeeze it throagh a doth, 
and add a little sogar^ then pass it through a 
jelly bag. To have the water clear^ keep it oool 
till the moment yon use it^ and then pass it 
through the bag. If you use it as a syrup to 
drink^ add to it water to your taste^ with sugar 
enough to make it palatable. If for ices^ add 
more sugar^ and put your water into the ice-pail^ 
and put it into the ice with saltpetre. When it 
begins to ice round the edges^ stir it from time 
to time with a spoon till it is all iced^ because^ 
if the edges are too much iced^ the middle will 
not be sufficiently so. When finished^ put it 
into glasses to serve at once. When you 
wish to serve ices, begin an hour before you 
serve. 

FBOMAGE D£ CKEME A LA GLACE. 

Take a pint of cream — thick it must be — 
half a pint of milk, the yolk of an egg beaten, 
and three quarters of a pound of sugar ; let it 
boil up on the fire five or six times, and take it 
off; add some vanilla, orange-flower, bergamot, 
lemon, or citron, in essence, which flower you 
please, and put it into an ice-pail; put the 



WHIFFED CREAMS. 137 

mould into a psdl^ with ice pounded at the 
bottom^ and a good handful of salt and salt- 
petre. Fill the pail to the top round the mouldy 
mix salt and saltpetre with it. When your 
Wage is iced and ready, turn it out, and 
serve immediately. 

LES GANNELONS DE CIUBME GLACEE. 

The cannelons are fluted moulds^ and are 
called after them. There is no difference in 
preparing the ice — the only difference is in the 
mould. 

CBEME DE FRAMBGISES. 

Take half a pint of fresh raspberries, picked 
and washed^ pound them in a mortar ; boil three 
half-pints of cream with half a pint of milk^ 
and sugar to taste ; let it boil till half reduced^ 
let it cool a little^ and put in your raspberries ; 
mix them together. Dissolve about the size of a 
coffee-grain of rennet^ and put it to your cream 
when lukewarm only; then pass all through 
the tamis into a compotier that can bear the fire 
without cracking; put the compotier on some 
hot ashes^ cover it^ and put a little hot ashes on 
the cover. When the cream is set, put it in a 
cool place, or on ice till you serve. 



188 WHIPPED CREAMS. 

CEEME DE F&AISES 

Is made in the same manner^ with this differ- 
ence, that on taking the cream off the fire when 
safficiently reduced, you add the yolks of two 
eggs, first beaten with two spoonsful of cream ; 
then put it on the fire for a minute, stirring the 
cream till the eggs are done, without boiling, or 
they will curdle. Finish as before. 

CKEME FOUETrEE. 

Take a pint of good cream, put it into an 
earthen pan, with a Uttle orange-flower water, or 
the flowers praline, half a quarter of a pound of 
sifted sugar, about the size of a nut of gum- 
dragon, pounded and sifted. Whip your cream, 
and as it rises in froth, with a strainer put it on a 
tamis, and continue to whip it till all is finished ; 
take the drainings firom the tamis, and whip that 
also ; then put your cream into the dish you serve 
it in — glass is best — and garnish with citron and 
preserved fruit cut in fillets. Those who like 
the flavour of lemon-peel, can add it grated on 
sugar, or cut the rind of a lemon fine, and let it 
infuse when the cream is whipped. Serve it 
high in the dish, and if you have any left, serve 
in glasses. 



WHIPPED CREAMS. 139 

CEEME A LA PORTUGAISE. 

Take a pint of good cream, put into it half a 
spoonful of coffee made strong, the same of 
orange-flower water, with half a quarter of a 
pound of sifted sugar, two eggs, whites and 
yolks, whip well together till quite thick. Put 
this into a compotier, and put it into a bain 
maree till the cream is set ; then put it in a cool 
place on ice till ready to serve. 

CREME POUETTEE DE PRAISES ET PRAHBOISES. 

Whip three half-pints of thick cream as 
before, putting it on a tamis to drain ; when you 
have whipped it, take some raspberries or straw- 
berries, fresh gathered, about half a pint, pass 
them through a tamis, and mix with the juice 
two ounces of sifted sugar, then mix with the 
whipped cream, and whip altogether again a 
moment before you serve, and arrange it as 
before in the dish. It is less trouble, and 
answers equally well, to add the juice of the 
fruit to the cream in the first instance, and to 
ice it by putting it on ice in a cellar. 

CREME A LA REINE. 

Put a pint of cream on the fire, with two 



140 WHIPPED CREAMS. 

ounces of sugar ; let it boil till it is well reduced. 
When you are about to take it oflF the fire, put 
in some essence of vanilla^ or some orange- 
flower water, and the whites of two eggs well 
beaten ; stir it on the fire for a moment, until 
the white of egg is done enough; take it off, 
place it in your dish, and let it get cold before 
you serve it, 

FEOMAGE AU NATUB.EL A LA CREME. 

Take a pint of good milk, and warm it on the 
fire ; then add about the size of a pea of rennet. 
Then put your milk on some hot cinders, with 
the same on the cover, and let the curd set ; when 
it has, put it into a cheese vat to drain, and then 
put it into a compotier to serve with good cream 
sweetened with sugar. Sift some sugar over 
it. 

FBOMAGE POUETTE. 

Chop or grate fine some lemon-peel, and put it 
into an earthen pan with a pint and a half of 
good thick cream, and about the size of a pea of 
gum-dragon. Whip your cream well, and as 
the froth rises, take it off with a strainer, and 
put it into an osier cheese vat, with a bit of thin 



WHIPPED CBEAMS. 141 

muslin inside the vat. When all the cream is 
whipped and put in, let it drain till you serve ; then 
turn it out^ and sift sugar over it ; it is firmer 
when made the day before you serve it. 

CEEME DE VIN DTJ EHIN. 

Put a bottle of Bhine wine^ a stick of cin- 
namon^ some lemon-peel^ and sugar into a stew- 
pan ; when it boils^ add the yolks of eight eggs^ 
which you beat with half a wine-glass full of 
water ; stir till the eggs begin to thicken ; then 
pass it through a tamis ; into the dish you serve 
it in you can sometimes whip the whites of the 
eggs^ and when very hot, add them and serve as 
before. Sherry is equally good in place of the 
Rhenish wine; the quantity used must depend 
on the size of the dish you require. By adding 
a little dissolved isinglass, and putting it into a 
mould, you can^ when cold, turn it out ; but in 
this case it must be made twelve hours at least 
before you serve it. 

CBEME A FBIBE. 

Take about half a pound of flour^ and mix 
it with a pint of milk; then add eight eggs, 
yolks and whites beaten together. Put it on the 



142 WHIPPED CREAMS. 

fire^ and stir all the time till the cream thiekens ; 
add a bit of salt^ a little butter^ and some grated 
lemon-peel^ with a little orange-flower water. 
When it is boiled^ flour your pan, and poar the 
cream into it, letting it extend all over; when 
cold, it ought to have the appearance of a dressed 
omelet. Cut it into pieces the size you wish, and 
fry them in fresh lard or butter, as you prefer. 
When coloured and warm, arrange them on the 
dish ; sift sugar over them, and glaze if you like 
with a hot salamander. Serve hot. For change, 
sometimes dip the piece into the beaten yolk of 
an egg, and shake the crumbs of a stale sponge 
or Savoy biscuit over them before you fiy, or 
bread-crumbs will answer, but are not so deli- 
cate. To make these creams more delicate, use 
rice flour in place of common flour ; potato flour 
is good. 

CREME DOUCE. 

Take two pints of milk, a pint of cream, and 
after scalding, let them stand ; skim all the cream 
that rises, and put it on a plate; then again 
put the pan on the fire, and do the same, till you 
have skimmed all the cream off; add to it some 
orange-flower water, or essence of vanilla, which 



WHIFFED CREAMS. 143 

most persons prefer, and sift sugar over it ; you 
must place the cream as you skim it on the dish 
you serve it in. 

CEEME BLANCHE. 

Put a pint and a half of cream and milk, and 
half a quarter of a pound of sugar, into a stew- 
pan ; let it boil ten minutes or rather less ; then 
take it off, and add the whites of two eggs well 
beaten ; stir together till well mixed. Put the 
cream on the fire again, and let it boil up five or 
six times, whipping it the whole time; then 
arrange in your dish, and when cold, pour over 
it a little orange-flower water, and sift sugar over 
it. You may brown it with a hot salamander 
sometimes, to make a change. Cinnamon cream 
is made in the same manner. 

CEEME DE THE 

Is made in the same manner, only adding 
when boiling a cup of strong green tea, and 
the yolks of eggs in place of the whites, with 
a little dissolved isinglass or not, according to 
your taste. 

CEEME DE CAFE 

Is made in the same manner, only in place of 
green tea use some strong coffee. 



144 WHIPPED CBEAMS. 

CBJSME AU CHOCOIAT 

Is prepared as before^ only adding some scraped 
chocolate^ and whisking it well when mixing. 
Add isinglass or not^ according to taste and cir- 
cumstances. 

CSEME A l'aLLEMAGNE. 

Put two pints of cream^ with about half a 
quarter of a pound of sugar^ into a stewpan, 
put it on the fire^ and stir constantly with a 
wooden spoon^ till it is reduced to a pint ; then 
take it off the fire, take the gizzard of a fowl, 
take off the skin, clean and chip it in pieces, put 
a glass of the cream into a small stewpan, and put 
the gizzard into it, and put it on hot ashes till it 
thickens, then strain it through a tamis to the other 
cream, and put it in the dish in which it is to be 
served ; put this dish into a bain maree ; when it is 
thick enough put it to cool. It must be served cold. 

CEEME AU VEEMICELLE. 

Boil some vermicelli in water, and drain it on 
a tamis, put it into a stewpan with some good 
cream, and sweeten it to taste, add some pre- 
served citron cut fine, a ratifia biscuit, and some 
grated lemon-peel, cinnamon in a stick or pow- 



ICES. 145 

der. Let it boil. When sufficiently boiled, add 
to it the yolks of seven or eight eggs, beaten, 
and the whites whisked to snow. Arrange it 
then in the dish you serve it in, and put it into 
the oven. When it has risen, powder sugar over 
it and glaze it with a salamander : serve immedi- 
ately. This will be found very good and delicate. 



ICES. 

To make ices, it is necessary to know how to 
clarify sugar, which is as follows : 

Put in a preserving-pan or earthen pipkin the 
white of an egg and half a glass of water, whip 
them together with an osier whisk ; when a strong 
froth, add three or four pints of water, whisking 
the whole time ; break the sugar in small pieces 
and clarify it ; put into the white of egg a suffi- 
cient quantity to melt, put the pan on the fire, 
and stir the sugar to melt it ;. when melted, let 
the skim rise, like milk, then add some more 
white of egg ; do not stir it ; let it rise a second 
time ; then throw in half a glass of clear water, and 
let it rise a third time ; then take off the pan 
and skim it well, put it on the hot hearth till 
the sugar boils^ and the skim is all on one side 

L 



146 ICES. 

of the pan^ which take off clear. By following 
these directions the syrup will become fine^ clear^ 
and transparent. If it is not clear, too much 
water has been used, so let it boil for some time 
till it becomes clear; try the sugar if it has 
reached the petit lisse, thus, moisten the top of 
your finger and press it against your thumb, if 
you feel it thick between them^ it is the first 
point, called le petit lisse. 

SUCEE ATJ GRAND LISSE. 

To reach this point, you must put the syrup 
again on the fire, or leave it on, as the case may 
be, and continue to let it boil some time, till on 
trying it in the same manner you find it still 
more sticky and thick. 

LB PERLE. 

You must still boil it, till on trying it, it is like 
glue between your fingers. 

LA PETITE PLUME. 

This point can be known in two ways, either 
like the last or with the spoon. Dip the spoon 
into the sugar, then shake it a little; blow 
through the holes of the strainer, and if little 
globes fly off it is done enough. Cfr dip your 



ICES. 147 

finger in as before, if you find on working it be- 
tween your fingers it becomes white, and on open- 
ing them forms a thread, it is la petite plume. 

LA GRANDE PLUME. 

Let the sugar boil more, and if on blowing it 
the globes are larger and more of them this is la 
grande plume. 

In any mixture where it is necessary to add 
sugar very lightly, add it to water, and let it 
boil till well mixed. In these mixtures use the 
sugar that has boiled to le petit lisse, because it 
is lighter and mixes easier. If it is not well 
mixed it will form fillets in the ice, which will 
spoil the look, and your ice will not be well 
finished unless you take the necessary precau- 
tions. 

ICES. 

To succeed well, and make your ices perfect 
and good, choose fruit, neither too ripe or other- 
wise, without any spot or defect. 

Before beginning your ices, have all your uten- 
sils necessary ready at hand. 

If you have saltpetre, use it, if not salt will 
answer, but you must use less, it produces greater 
cold and quicker. 

L 2 



148 ICES. 

The ice diminishes the flavour of everything 
used^ you must therefore carefully attend to this 
precaution^ and use sufficient to have the flavour 
you wish in your ices. 

Choose your pails of pewter, they are better 
than tin, for though tin is less porous than pew- 
ter, and the ices can be made quicker, they are 
not so good as the pewter, for the creams ice too 
quickly. There must be a hole in your pail, in 
which you put a peg, by this you can let ofi" the 
water. You must have an instrument called a 
houlette, they are made of tin or copper, and are 
the shape of a shepherd's crook. This is to 
work the ices. 

You must not fill your pails too full with ice, 
as, if two thirds, or even half full, you can work 
your ice better than when full. 

Pound the ice ; there must be twelve or fifteen 
pounds to each pail ; fill it about two inches, and 
sprinkle over it some saltpetre or a little salt ; 
put in your ice-pail on this, and continue to put 
in the ice round it with salt or saltpetre till the 
pail is full. Let it rest five or six minutes, after 
that turn round your ice in the pail quickly for 
ten or fifteen minutes. Open your sarbotiere, 
but first wipe the cover and the edge ; if it has 



ICES. 149 

begun to ice, you will see a crust formed round 
it ; stir this in and close the sarboti^re ; repeat 
this eyery ten minutes or quarter of an hour ; 
detach the ice with your houlette in the right 
hand, and turn the pail with your left. 

When you see your ice has taken, that is the 
time to work it ; if it is not firm enough, renew 
the ice in the pail with salt or saltpetre. 

As this work is compiled for the use of those 
who are not learners, I shall not enter into details 
as to the preparation farther than a few hints 
that may be useful. 

If, on opening your sarbotiere the first time, 
you see that your cream has not begun to con- 
geal, be sure there is not sugar enough. To 
remedy this, mix a little water with some sugar 
that has boiled to the petit lisse. Mix this with 
a little of the cream, and put it into the sarbo- 
tiere, stirring it till mixed ; cover it and turn it 
round. If the mixture is too thick, do the same 
as when not sweet enough. 

There is another inconvenience to be remedied. 
When the preparation is too thin, or too little 
fruit or sugar, when it is finished it tastes dry 
and gritty, you will know this by stirring it with 
the houlette. Take some sugar boiled to the 



150 ICES. 

grande plume^ and put a little into the prepara- 
tion, gently mixing it. It is only ices of flowers, 
fruit, vines, and liqueurs that this can be done 
to, never creams. 

GLACES MOULES. 

Ices in moulds, or glace fruit, is made with the 
same preparation as when the sarbotiere is used. 
The moulds may be made in any form you please, 
for all sorts of fruit all you require is moulds of 
block tin, made in the form you desire. Les 
cannelons are fluted moulds, as I before said. 
You must use the fruit in preparation of the ice 
that the mould represents. Hold your ices 
always with a cloth, as the heat of the hands 
melts it. 

COLOUBS. 

When you colour ices it must be at the mo- 
ment you take them out of the mould, and imi- 
tate the colours as well as is possible. 

Green is made with indigo and gum gutte. 
This is the colour for peaches, pears, and green- 
gages. Yellow is made with gomme gutte, for 
lemons, quinces, and some pears; mixed with 
carmine or saffron, it is used for oranges. 



ICES. 151 

Carmine is used for peachesj apricots^ and any 
fruit that has a tinge of red; mixed with indigo^ 
it is used for violets. 

Burned sugar or chocolate is used for brown. 
Spinach-juice is used for green ; to make it^ scald 
the spinach^ pound and strain the juice through 
a tamis^ and then it is fit for ase. 

I have given the colours, to be used if wished. 

OBANGE-FLOWER ICE. 

In summer pick the orange-flowers, put them 
in a basin ; pour on them some syrup boiled to 
the petit lisse. Cover the basin, that the perfume 
shall not evaporate ; let it infuse three or four 
hours ; then strain it through a tamis. Use this 
to make your ice ; if too strong of the orange- 
flower, add the juice of a lemon. 

GLACE DE ROSES. 

Gather some fresh roses, pick them and put 
them into a basin, with some sugar boiled to the 
petit lisse. Cover the basin and let it infuse 
twelve hours ; then strain this through a tamis 
and use it to make your ice. 

GLACE DE VIOLETTES. 

Pick some fresh violets, pound them and pass 



152 ICES. 

the juice through a tamis; let it boil up in 
syrup ; strain it a second time, and make your 
ice with it. 

GLACE d' ANANAS. 

Scrape the pine-apple on a hot grater, on a 
coarse tamis over an earthen pan. When all is 
scraped, squeeze the juice hard through the 
tamis, then pound it with a little sugar, and 
again pass it through a tamis, so as to have all 
the filaments cleared away ; throw two or three 
spoonsful of water on these filaments ; add some 
syrup boiled to the lisse, and, when cold, add the 
juice of a lemon, as it improves the flavour if the 
fruit is very ripe. When the fruit and syrup are 
well mixed, strain it again and make your ice. 
In winter use pine-apple marmalade, which must 
be diluted with a little hot water, adding lemon 
juice as before. Finish the same. 

GLACE DE CBDBATS. 

Scrape a citron or lime-peel very fine, and mix 
it with syrup boiled to the petit lisse, and when 
cold, let it infuse five or six minutes ; then strain 
it through a tamis; then squeeze the juice of 
five or six lemons and half a glass of water. 



ICES. 153 

When well mixed^ strain through a silk tammy^ 
and make your ice as before. 

OLACE D'ABMOOTa. 

Pass through an ice-sieve the juice of some 
apricots^ add sugar boiled to the petit lisse : if 
too sweety add the juice of a lemon. Pound the 
kernels^ and let them infuse in some warm syrup; 
then add it to the fruity as the flavour of the 
kernel improves the ice; then finish as before. 
In winter^ make your ices with marmalade 
mixed with a little warm syrup boiled to the 
lisse, and add the juice of a lemon. Pound five 
or six bitter almonds, infuse them in hot syrup, 
steam it, and add this to the fruit : finish the 
ices as before. 

GLACE DE CrraONS. 

Eight lemons will make eighteen glasses of 
ice; wash them well, and wipe them; then peel 
four of them, and put the rinds to infuse in 
syrup boiled to the lisse; and when cold, let 
them remain ten minutes, and strain it through 
a tamis: squeeze into this syrup the juice of 
eight lemons, and when cold, half a pint of 
syrup boiled to the petit lisse: again strain 



154 ICES. 

to mix the whole better^ and finish your ices 
as brfore. 

GLACE DE GOINGS. 

Roast your quinces, as they will have more 
flavour than if scalded; squeeze them through 
an ice-tammy ; add them to the syrup with the 
juice of a lemon : warm it on the fire ; let it cool, 
and finish your ices as. usual. 

GLACE DE PRAMBOISES. 

Peel some fine raspberries; wash and drain 
them, then rub them through a sieve ; add them 
to the sugar au petit lisse, and finish as before. 
In the winter, use raspberry syrup. 

GLACE DE GBOSEILLES. 

Currant ice is made in the same manner as 
the raspberries, with this diflference — you must 
put them on the fire in a preserving-pan with a 
little water, and then squeeze through the tamis 
to the syrup, as before. 

GLACE DE 7RAISES. 

This is made like the last, using fresh straw- 
berries, with some currant juice, prepared as 
before; strain the juice and fruit through a 
tamis ; add the syrup, and finish as before. 



ICES. 155 

GLACE d'oRANGES. 

Orange ices are made with sweet oranges. 
Grate or peel two or three oranges, and infuse 
the rind five or six minutes in syrup ; strain it 
through a tamis, and squeeze the juice of seven, 
eight or more, as you, may require them : add 
them to the syrup in which the rinds were 
infused; put a little water on the pulp of the 
oranges ; sweeten it well : if the oranges are too 
ripe, add the juice of a lemon, and finish as 
before. You may fill the rinds of the oranges 
with ice, if you like, and they look well : leave 
a bit across to serve as a handle. 

GLACE DE PECHES. 

Skin the peaches, and squeeze them through 
an ice-sieve; pound the kernels after blending 
them, and rub them through the same tamis ; 
add the syrup, and finish your ice as usual. 
If the peaches are too ripe, add the juice of 
a lemon : and remember, in all cases, if finiit 
is too ripe, the juice of a lemon improves the 
flavour, and takes off the vapid flavour that 
fruit often has when too ripe. These little hints 
are worth attending to on all occasions, especially 
with ice. 



156 ICE8. 

ICE CREAMS. 

Be very particalar in having yonr cream very 
sweety or yonr ices will be spoiled. It mnst be 
very thick cream ; it requires a shorter time on 
the fire to thicken^ and less yolk of egg to give 
it body. 

UAKSJSB, OF PBEPABIN6 THE CBEAK. 

Take four yolks of eggs for a pint of cream^ 
and abont a quarter of a pound of sugar. Put 
the yolks of the eggs into a pan^ a little sugar^ 
beat well together^ then add your cream by 
degrees. Put the pan on a gentle fire till the 
cream thickens without boiling ; stir it carefully 
with a wooden spoon or a silver spoon; let it 
simmer very gently. When thick enough, take 
it off the fire, and let it cool ; strain it through a 
tamis, and keep stirring it till quite cold. This 
is the best preparation of the cream, which you 
flavour to your taste. 

GLACE DE CKEME A LA YANILLE. 

Choose some good vanilla-pods, or use the 
essence ; prepare your cream as before, but put 
in the vanilla before you put it on the fire ; add 
a small bit of cinnamon, but it must be a very 



ICES. 157 

small bit, or it will overpower the vanilla — ^and 
many prefer vanilla alone : let this be finished as 
before. You can mould this ice into tablets or 
cannelons, and then it is called fromage glac^. 

OLACE BE CEEME A LA CANNELLE. 

This is prepared in the same way as the vanilla 
ice, using essence of cinnamon in place of vanilla : 
two drops of the essence will be enough for a 
pint ; you will add it when thick and cold. Finish 
as before. 

GLACE DE CBEME ATJX PISTAGHES. 

Take a quarter of a pound of pistachios for 
a pint of thick cream. Blanch and pound your 
pistachios, moistening them with cream, whilst 
pounding, to prevent their oiling. Put them 
into the cream, prepared as before; and when 
thick enough, take it off the fire, and strain it 
through a tamis; rub it with a wooden spoon, 
so that as much as possible of the pistachios 
is rubbed through. Let it cool, and finish as 
before. 

GLACE DE CEEME AUX AHAI^DES. 

Take eighteen sweet almonds, and six bitter, 
for a pint of cream — not more, as the flavour 



158 ICES. 

will be too strong; blanch and pound the al- 
monds with a little cream^ to prevent it oiling: 
when pounded^ add it to the eream, and finish 
the same as before. If too thick, strain it when 
you take it off the fire. You can put this into 
moulds^ like tablets, biscuits, cannelons, and 
fromages, which are called fromages glaces. This 
has a very delicate flavour. 

GLACE D£ CREME AUX MAKBONS. 

Take twenty chesnuts for a pint of cream; 
roast and peel them; then pound them fine, 
moistening them with a little cream, and rub 
them through an ice-sieve ; add it to the cream 
as before; finish the same. You may add a 
little vanilla, if you like, and a small bit of 
cinnamon, or either alone. You may serve the 
chesnuts as follows also. 

MARRONS GLACES EN SURPRISE. 

Put thirty chesnuts into warm water, to soften 
the shell, and render it easier to empty them. Let 
them steep all night, and the following day open 
the chesnuts at the side with a penknife, and 
take out the chesnuts in small pieces, so as not 
to break the shell; scrape them clean inside, 



ICES. 159 

fill them with ice^ and put them into an ice-pail^ 
closely covered, and put ice on the top, so that 
the chesnuts recover their form. You must begin 
early, so as to have time. If carefully prepared, 
they will look in their natural state. Serve them 
on a napkin, like eggs ; but they must be served 
quickly, lest they melt. 

GLACE DE CREME AU CAPE BLANC. 

Take a quarter of a pound of coflFee for a pint 
of cream. Beat two whites of eggs with some 
powdered sugar, till they form a paste like royal 
icing ; dilute this with the cream, and put it on 
the fire to thicken, but not boil ; . taste your cream 
to see if it is sweet enough, then take it off the 
fire, and put it into the sarbotiere. Boast your 
coffee, grind it, and then add it to the cream, 
covering it close to prevent it evaporating. Put 
the sarbotiere into a bain maree full of hot water, 
but not on the fire : keep it on a hot hearth, so 
as to preserve the same heat as nearly as pos- 
sible for two hours and a half; then pass the 
cream through a tamis, without squeezing it, lest 
the coffee should go through also, which would 
spoil the appearance. When cold, -finish as 
before. 



160 ICES. 

GLACE DE CREME AUX CEXTES. 

Prepare your cream as usual^ and when it 
begins to thicken^ add the yolks of eight hard 
eggs for a pint; let it thicken, and strain it 
through a tamis, finish as before. This is a 
heavy ice, but makes a variety. 

GLACE DE CEEME AU £IZ. 

Put into a stewpan three spoonsful of rice 
flour sifted through a drum, the whites of three 
eggs and some powdered sugar ; beat all together, 
then add a pint of cream ; let it simmer on a slow 
fire till it thickens, stirring it continually, or it 
will burn ; it must not be left too long on the 
fii'c; strain it through a silk tamis; let it get 
cold, and finish as usual. 

GLACE DE CREME AU CHOCOLAT. 

Scrape fine a pound of chocolate, and put it on 
the fire to soften without water, stirring it with a 
silver spoon ; when melted, add some cream by 
degrees till you have used a pint, then beat the 
yolks of three eggs with a little sugar; add all 
together; let it simmer, but not boil; when thick 
enough, pass it through a tamis, and finish as 
before. 



161 



GLACE DE CBEME AU THE 



Is made in the same manner^ substituting half 
a cup of strong tea for the chocolate. 

OLACE DE CBEME AUX FSAliBGISES. 

Squeeze about half a pound of raspberries^ and 
strain the juice through a tamis ; mix this with 
some thick cream and sugar^ put it on the fire 
to thicken^ let it cool^ and ice it as before. 

OLACE DE CBEME AUX 7BAISES. 

Squeeze a pound of fresh strawberries through 
a tamis^ and mix the juice with a pint of cream 
and some sugar; beat the whites of two eggs to 
snow with a little pounded sugar; put all in a 
stewpan^ and put it on the fire to thicken^ but 
not boil ; take it ofT^ let it cool^ and finish as 
before. In winter use marmalade. AU these 
are called fromages glacis. 



OLACES DE CBEME YIEBGE OU CBEME NATUBELLE. 

Crimes yierges are those that are not boiled 
and the colour not changed by the flavour given. 
If the flavour changes the colour^ the ices are 
called cr^e naturelle. 

M 



162 ICE8. 

6LAGES DE CBEME YIESGE. 

Beat the whites of four fresh eggs to sncfW, 
then mix them with a pint of thick creamy sugar 
in powder^ and any flavour you please^ and finish 
like other ices. This is a very delicate mode of 
making ice^ as the heaten whites render the ices 
very light. 

6LAGE DE CKEME NATUUBLLE ATI CAPE BLLSC, 

Fat a pint of cream into your ice-pail, put 
some good ground Mocha coffee into a frying-pan 
to roast, throw it into the cream— or you may 
use the berries — cover the pail, and put it into a 
bain mar^ of hot water, but not boiling; let it 
infuse two hours, pass it through a tamis to clear 
it from the cofiee, sugar it to taste, finish as 
before. 

GLACE DE CBEME NATCBELLE AU CAFE BAUN. 

Make a cup of very strong coffee, and add it 
to a pint of cream, with sugar to taste ; it must 
be rather sweet, on account of the acidity of the 
coffee. Finish as before. If you wish to add 
the beaten whites of eggs, whip them before you 
add them to the cream. 



ICES. 163 

OLACS DE OBEME NATUBELLE A lA VA19ILLE. 

Pound a bit of vanilla with some lump sugar^ 
as it will be found better ; sift it through a silk 
sieve; what will not pass must be pounded again 
till all is in fine powder ; pot this into a pint and 
a half of cream^ and ice it as before. You may 
use whites of eggs beaten to snow in all the 
ices au naturelle. 

GLACE A LA CANfELLE. 

Prepare this in the same manner as the last^ 
substituting cinnamon for vanilla. 

GLACE AUX FBAISES. 

Prepare some fresh strawberries in summer by 
rubbing them through a tammy, and then mixing 
the juice with cream and sugar in powder^ or in 
winter use marmalade ; pass it through a tammy, 
mix with your cream, and finish as before. 

GLACE ATJX PKAMBGISaSS. 

This is prepared in the same manner as the 
strawberries, and finished like them. 

GLACE AU CITRON OU A L^OBANGE. 

Grate some lemon or orange-peel on a lump of 
sugar, and add the raspings to a pint and a half

of cream; sugar to taste^ and then finish your 
ice as before. Limes^ Seville oranges^ c^drat 
and bergamot ices are made in the same 
manner. 

GLACE D£ CHOCOLAT A L^EAU. 

Melt a pound of chocolate in some water^ and 
let it simmer slowly^ but do not let it boil; it 
thickens better, and does not lose its perfume by 
slow sinmiering. At the end of two hours, take 
o£f the chocolate, and add some syrup boiled to 
the petit lisse. This sugar is very light ; finish 
it as before. If you like chocolate with vanilla, 
take the chocolate k la vanilla, and add in melting 
— a little more vanilla, in essence is best — ^a bit of 
cinnamon and two cloves ; let them simmer with 
the chocolate, and finish as before. 

GLACE DE MAEASqUIK. 

Scrape the rinds of four lemons, on sugar 
boiled to the petit lisse, let them infuse five 
minutes ; strain them. It is better to peel the 
lemons thin, as they are easier to take out 
without straining; squeeze the juice of eight 
lemons into the sugar ; add a glass of water if 
too sweet, and a glass of Maraschino. Strain it 



ICB8. 165 

two or three times through a silk tamis ; better 
to mix it together ; taste it to make sore there is 
sujOBicient flarour of the Maraschino^ and sweet 
enough ; then finish your ice as usual. Noyeau 
or Curacoa might be used in place of the 
Maraschino. 

PEOMAGES GLACES. 

You can prepare the fromages glaces with all 
the compositions that are usually served in shapes 
or moulds^ such as fruits^ flowers^ creams^ liqueurs. 
You must put each fromage into a mouldy the 
form of the fruit which you serve, or have it at 
the bottom of the mould so as to turn out at 
the top— thus, when you serve a fromage of 
pine-apple, you must use a mould to correspond. 

FBOMAGES AT7X EFIN6LES, 0T7 A L^ANGLAISE. 

This fromage is called Ipingle, because the 
cream only receives the first icing; it is put 
quite liquid into the mould, and is neither to be 
stirred or worked ; thus it will form in threads of 
ice; these are called epingles. All sorts of 
creams, &c., can be served thus when not boiled, 
for if boiled they will not answer. 



166 IGBS. 



HANKER or PSEPAKC^G IT. 

Make a cream with any firoit yon like ; when 
well mixedj put into a mould k firomage, and put 
this mould in ice well pounded, and mixed with 
salt or saltpetre; let it remain three or four 
hours, without stirring or working, only taking 
care it is well surrounded with ice ; then serve. 
There will be threads of ice on the cream called 
^pingka. 

7B01CAGB A LA. GHANTILLT. 

This is made with whipped cream. It must 
only receive the first congealing. Simply put 
the cream, after being well whisked and drained, 
into a mould II fromage ; bury this mould in ice, 
mixed with salt ; set and leave it quiet for three 
or four hours, according to the size of the mould. 
When you serve^ turn it oat. With all the 
whipped creams (mousses) that follow, you can 
make fromage h la Chantilly, and very thick 
cream must be used to make the mousses, as it is 
easier to whip, and has more consistence. U 
the cream is too thin, the mousse will be too 
light and delicate for a fromage. 



MOUsaBS. 167 

MOUSSES. 

Put your cream into an earthen pan^ and 
sweeten it with sifted sugar, according to taste ; 
stir it with a spoon to melt it, then whisk the 
cream with an osier or tin whisk. You must 
whip at the edge, and never in the middle of the 
cream, because that will give it too much con- 
sistence, and prevent its frothing well. As the 
froth is formed, skim it oflf with a spoon that has 
holes in it, and put it on a thin tamis, with a 
pan below to receive the drainings ; continue to 
whisk the cream till all is formed into a strong 
froth. Take away the drainings, and again 
whisk it till all is used. 

When all the cream is whisked with a large 
spoon, stir it on the tamis to give it consistence, 
otherwise it will be too light. Fill your glasses 
or cups, and place them in a pail filled with ice ] 
cover the pail, and when ready to serve, wipe 
your glasses, and arrange them on a dish. 

MOUSSE A LA VANILLE. 

Found a bit of vanilla with some sugar, sift it 
fine, add it to your cream, whisk, and finish as 
directed. 



168 MOUSSES. 

MOUSSE A LA OANNELLE. 

This is prepared in the same manner^ only 
substituting cinnamon for vanilla. Two drqps 
of the essence will be enough for a pint of 
cream. 

MOUSSE A l'aIOS. 

Put into a pan^ with a cover, a spoonful of 
aniseed and a pint of cream; put this into a 
bain maree of boiling water, and take it off the 
fire; let it infuse two hours, then strain the 
cream through a tamis; let it cool, sweeten it, 
and whip the cream, as before directed, to a 
mousse. 

MOUSSE A l'aMBEEGBIS. 

A small piece of ambergris will flavour a pint 
of cream, or two drops of the essence will pro- 
duce the same effect ; put it to the cream, add 
sugar to taste, and whip it as before. 

MOUSSE AU CTEBON. 

Scrape a lemon with sugar, and put it into 
your cream ; let it infuse two hours, then strain 
the cream through a tamis ; add sugar, and 
finish your mousse as before. 



MOUSSES. 169 

MOUSSE AU CEDRAT. 

Is made in the same manner as the lemon^ 
and so is a mousse d^orange, with either sweet or 
Seville oranges^ a very small proportion must be 
used of the latter^ or it will make the cream 
bitter. Candied orange-peel, or citron grated, 
gives a good flavour. 

MOUSSE AU CHOCOLAT. 

Scrape half a pound of chocolate, and put it 
on the fire to melt ; stir it the whole time to 
soften equally, then add a little cream by de- 
grees till you have mixed a pint, then strain it 
through a tamis, taking care the chocolate has all 
dissolved; add sugar to taste, let it cool, and 
whip it as before directed. 

MOUSSE AU CAFE BLANC. 

Put a pint of cream into a pan that has a 
cover ; roast a quarter of a pound of coffee, and 
put it into the cream, cover the pan closely, and 
put it into a bain mar^e for an hour to infuse. 
Do not let the water boil, but keep it warm ; 
then strain it through a tamis, sweeten it, and 
finish as before. 



170 MOUSSES. 

MOUSSE AU CUFE BB,UN. 

Make a cup of strong cream^ strain it into 
your cream, sweeten it, and whisk as be- 
fore. 

MOUSSE PBAISES. 

Mix four spoonsful of strawberry marmalade, 
or fresh when in season, with half a pint of 
cream; sweeten to taste, strain it through a 
tamis, and whisk it as before. 

Raspberries or currants may be used in the 
same manner with equal success, or the juice of 
red gooseberries, or any syrup that has been pre- 
pared for winter use. 

MOUSSE AUX VINS, LIQUEUES, OU EATAEIAS. 

For all kinds of mousses with wines or liqueurs, 
the cream must be very thick, as the wine thins 
it. You may use sherry, rum, brandy, noyeau, 
Cura9oa, Maraschino. Mix about a glass to a 
pint of cream, a little sugar to taste, and whisk 
as before, with noyeau, Cura9oa, &c. The flavour 
will be very delicate and recherche. 

A TBXFLE. 

Take some stale Savoy biscuits or sponge 
cakes, steep them in white wine, to which you 



TKIFLES, 171 

mayj if you please^ add a glass of brandy. When 
the cakes are quite soaked^ put them into your 
trifle dish^ and on them put a lay^ of ratifia 
cakes^ each dipped into the wine in which the 
other cakes were steeped. On the cakes put a 
layer of either apricot^ strawberry, or raspberry, 
marmalade, rather thick, cover this with a rich 
custard, made as follows : 

Boil half a pint of cream and a glass of milk 
with a stick of cinnamon till it has a nice 
flavour, sweeten to taste, and remember that 
you must make the cream too sweet, because, 
when the eggs are added, you cannot put more 
sugar. Boil also the thin rind of a lemon, or 
some grated lemon-peel, with the cream; or if 
you prefer the flavour of almonds, add either 
four or five bitter almonds pounded, or two 
laurel leaves, which has a very fine flavour. 
There exists a prejudice against the use of laurel 
leaves, but it is misplaced, as the moderate use 
never harms ; strain your cream when sufficiently 
flavoured — sometimes you may pound some 
sweet almonds, and when boiled, rub them 
through a tamis, but this depends on taste. 
Beat the yolks of four eggs with a little cream, 
put them into a basin, and hold it in your left 



172 JELLIES. 

hand ; take the boiling creaar in the other hand 
— ^for convenience) pat it in a jug — and pour it 
on the eggs quickly, then pour it back, and 
continue to pour it backwards and forwards as 
quickly as possible to mix without curdling; 
When nearly cold, put the custard again on the 
fire, stirring it one way till it thickens and 
nearly boils ; take it off at once, and continue 
stirring it till cool. When quite cold, put it on 
your firuit. If it boils, it will curdle, which 
spoils it. You should have it prepared and cold 
before you begin your trifle. Take some cream, 
whipped to a mousse, with what you please, and 
put on the trifle, prop it up, and garnish or not 
with nonpareil comfits. 

calves' feet jelly. 

Make a stock with some calves' feet, and strain 
off all the fat ; strain and let it get cold, then 
again skim it and wipe off any fat that is left 
with white paper. Put the jelly into a saucepan, 
with a pound of sugar, or less, according to the 
quantity of jelly. If you have two quarts of 
jelly, take sis lemons and peel them very thin. 
Squeeze the juice on the peel, then beat the 
whites of a dozen eggs, with the shells, and put 



JELLIES. 173 

them to the jelly stock. Put all on the fire, first 
adding the lemon-peel and juice^ whisk it all to- 
gether. When on the fire^ add a little dissolved 
isinglass ; let it hoil up a few minutes and strain 
it through your jelly-bag till clear, then add your 
wine or rum, and it will have a much finer flavour 
than if boiled, as is usual, and half the quantity 
will answer. Another advantage is, that you may 
make a variety in the flavour of the jelly by 
adding rum to one part, wine to another, and 
Cura9oa to another portion, so that you can vary 
the taste at will. Always add a little isinglass, 
because it makes it turn out better. Some like 
the flavour of cloves, but I think it better with?- 
out. 

0EAN6E JELLY. 

Rub the peel of six China oranges with half a 
pound of sugar; put three Seville oranges and 
three sweet oranges, or lemons are best, into a 
stewpan with a pint of water, one ounce of isin- 
glass, and boil all together till the isinglass is 
dissolved; then strain it into a basin with the 
juice of all the oranges and one lemon. If the 
oranges are too ripe, add the sugar that the 
oranges were rubbed on and a gkss of wine, stir 



174 FBESESTBS. 

it on the fire ten minuteB^ then strain it into 
the moulds. Lemon jelly is made in the same 
manner. 

OEANGE CSEIM. 

Squeeze twelve sweet oranges into a quart of 
jelly ; beat up the yolks of six eggs with a little 
of the jelly warmed^ then stir it into the other 
and keep stirring it till it begins to set^ then put 
it into the mould and use it if convenient. 

BLANC MANGE. 

Take a quart of cream and half an ounce of 
isinglass beaten fine ; put it into the eream^ let it 
simmer gently for a quarter of an hour, stirring 
all the time till the isinglass is dissolved. Take 
it off and sweeten to taste; add a spoonful of 
rose-water and the same of orange-flower water^ 
or some essence oi vaniDa; strain it and put it 
into your mould. Almonds may sometimes be 
used in place of vanilla. 



PRESERVES FOR TARTS, &c. 

BED CUBEANT JAM. 

Weigh your fruit and sugar in equal quan- 
tities ; put your fruit on first, and when the juice 



PRESBBVBS« 175 

begins to appear^ add part of your sugar^ stirring 
it the whole time^ then add more^ nmdng it till 
all is put in. Let it boil gently half an hour, 
skimming it clear. You will know when done 
enough by the syrup becoming thick^ like jelly> 
or by the fruit and syrup not separating when 
you take them up. 

BLACK CUERiLNT JAH. 

Is made with rather less sugar and requires a 
ittle more boiling; it should not be skimmed, 
)ut boil tin it is clear, then put it into pots, and 

when cold cover them with paper dipped in 

brandy, or sift sugar over it. 

AASPBESBY JAM. 

Pick your raspberries and weigh an equal 
quantity of sugar; put on your fruit alone and 
stir it with the spoon to prevent it sticking, when 
the juice is drawn add your sugar as before, as 
the colour is better than it would be if it was put 
on with the fruit. Let it boil rather slowly till 
the fruit is done enough, like a marmalade; skim 
it and put it into your pots as before. 

ANOTHER UOBE. 

Take some red currants and draw the juice as 



176 PRESEBVES. 

you would for jelly, about a pint; add this to 
one quart of raspberries and the same of sugar. 
Set them on a slow fire and stir them till th^ 
boil. Let it boil gently half an hour, stirring it 
well the whole time to prevent it sticking to the 
pan ; the sugar should be put in when it boils 
up ; then rub it through a tammy and pour it 
into your pots. They will keep good two or 
three years and have the full flavour of the rasp- 
berry. Some make this with a pint of red cur- 
rant jelly in place of using the juice. 

GOOSEBEEBY JAM. 

Take rather less than the same weight of sugar 
and prepare it like raspberry jam ; letting it boil 
longer till the fruit and syrup will not separate, 
then put it into pots as before. 

PLUM JAM, 

Take some fine damsons, or other plums, and 
to every pound of fruit put three quarters of a 
pound of good brown sugar, or white if you 
prefer it ; boil the sugar and fruit slowly for an 
hour, skimming it clear ; and if the juice is not 
sufficiently reduced, let it boil a little longer and 
put it into pots. You must be very particular as 



PKESERYES. 177 

to the boiling long^ for if not sufficiently boiledj 
this jam in particular will be apt to ferment j 
fhould this be the case^ boil it up, adding a little 
more sugar, 

CHEKRY JAM. 

Take some large Morello cherries ; cut off the 
stalks and stone them^ put them into a pre- 
serving-pan, with more than their weight in 
sugar and a glass of water. Let them simmer at 
first to draw the juice, then add the rest of the 
sugar, for you should only use part of the sugar 
at first. Let them boil up, and when they have 
boiled, let them continue to do so for more than 
an hour, slowly. Take them off, and put them 
into small pots as before. 

BAEBEfiJlY JAM 

Is made in the same manner as the other jams. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Strip the currants from the stalks ; put them 
in a stone jar, stop it close, set it in a kettle of 
boiling water half way up the jar, let it boil half 
an hour. Take it out, and strain the juice 
through a coarse hair sieve; to a pint of juice put 
a pound of sugar, set it over a quick plear fire in 

N 



178 PEE8BRVB8. 

a preserving-pan, stir it the whole time till the 
sugar is mdted, and then skim it dear as £ast as 
the seam rises. When your jelly is clear and 
strongs which you will know by dropping a little 
on a plate to see whether it jellies, put it into 
small glasses or jars. When cold^ cover them 
with brandy papers first and tie leather or paper 
over them ; or you may paste the covers round 
the edges^ which will exclude all the air. 

BASPBEERY JELLY 

Is made the same way^ only adding a little red 
currant juice to the raspberry juice. 

STBAWBEREY JELLY 

Is made in the same manner. Choose the 
reddest strawberries and also add some currant 
juice. 

GOOSEBERRY JELLY 

Is made like currant jelly^ rubbing the pulp 
thrcMigh if you wish to make it firm ; if a jelly^ 
strain off the juice only, and you can ufie the 
gooseberries for a pie, or boil them with a little 
brown sugar for present use. 



PRESEfiVES. 179 

APPLE JELLY, 

Fare and core some pippins or hard apples, 
and put tbem on to boil till quite soft 3 strain off 
the apple liquor, but do not rub any pulp through 
or it will spoil the look of the jelly, which should 
be beautifully clear and fine; boil some cloves 
and lemon-peel with it to give it a flavour, then 
add for each pint of juice three quarters of a 
pound of sugar and boil it to a jelly ; finish like 
the currant jelly. This is very delicate for 
desserts, 

DAMSON CHEESE. 

Take some ripe damsons and put them in a 
stone jar, and place that either in a kettle of boil- 
ing water or on a hot hearth, till soft enough to 
pulp through a tammy. Weigh this pulp^ and 
to every pound of fruit add three quarters of a 
pound of white sugar. Let this boil till it is 
in a thick marmalade, then pour it into small 
moulds^ blanch some of the kernels first and gar* 
nish the bottoms of the moulds with them, and 
stir a few into the pulp. When cold, paper over 
as before, and when you want to use it turn the 
fruit out of a mould, it will look well and be very 
good. To loosen it, put a silver knife round the 

N 2 



180 WATERS. 

edges and then lay a plate on it ; shake it out. 
Do not fill the moulds too full. Slip it on the 
dish you serve it on. 

Any kind of fruit might be prepared in the 
same manner. Apricot and greengage make de- 
licious cheese; and the small white buUace, 
which is a very acid fruit, answers particularly 
well^ but a pound of sugar must be used in place 
of three quarters, or the cheese will be too acid 
to be palatable. In all cases the artiste must use 
her own discretion, as a little more or less sugar 
than directed can often be used with advantage 
to the article prepared, though general rules must 
be given, and no one can fail in following them. 

FRUIT WAFERS. 

Take the pulp of any fruit rubbed through a 
hair sieve, and to every three ounces of fruit take 
six ounces of sugar, finely sifted ; dry the sugar 
well till it be very hot, then mix together 
after heating the pulp of the fruit ; set it on a 
hot hearth till it is almost boiling, then pour it 
on plates and again put it back till it is dry 
enough to leave the plates, but before it candies 
take it off and make them what shapes you please. 
These will be very nice at a dessertr 



WAVERS. 181 

"WHITE WAPEES. 

Beat the yolk of an egg and mix it with a 
quarter of a pint of water ; mix with it half a 
pound of flour and some orange-flower water and 
water to taste ; have your wafer irons hot and fill 
them with the batter like gaufires. A few 
minutes will bake them. 

BKOWN WAFEES. 

Take a quart of cream^ the yolks of four eggs 
well beaten, and as much flour as will make a 
thin batter; sweeten it with half a pound of sugar 
sifted and as much pounded cinnamon sifted as 
will flavour them ; butter your irons and make 
them very hot before you put in the batter. 

OBANGE WAFEES. 

Take some oranges, and boil them till tender 
in three or four waters, then take out the pips 
and the pulp, pound the rinds to a paste, and 
add your pulp when pounding ; rub this through 
a tammy. To a pound of pulp put a pound and 
a half of sugar sifted; take the pulp and half 
the sugar and boil together till it will pull out 
in strings ; take it off the fire, and when it is 
cold, mix the rest of the sugar with the paste, 



182 



and roll the cakes out as thin as paper. You 
most only make a little at a time, as it dries very 
fast. Cut them round, and let them dry. Ton 
must use Seville oranges. 



MINCE TIES, 

Take three pounds of suet shred very fine, and 
chopped as small as possible, two pounds of 
raisins stoned and chopped fine, two pounds of 
currants washed and dried by the fire, half a 
hundred pippins pared, cored, and cut fine, a 
pound and a half of sugar, a quarter of an ounce 
of mace pounded fine, the same of cloves, two 
large nutmegs grated ; put them all into a pan, 
and mix well together, then put it into a jar, and 
pour over it half a bottle of white wine, the 
same of brandy, and again mix together with a 
spoon. After a few days, stir into it some 
candied citron cut fine, some candied lemon and 
orange-peel also cut fine, the rind of a lemon 
chopped or cut very fine, and the juice of two 
lemons mixed with a glass of brandy or wine ; 
stir all up togethear, and make it a fortnight 
before you use it. This will keep good for four 
months if required. Half the quantity will be 



PASTRY. 188 

enough for a small family. I think a little cold 
roasted beef or tongue chopped fine after being 
boiled is a great improvement^ and a little more 
sugar^ as it is hardly sweet enough for general 
taste. This is an excellent receipt. Make your 
pies with a nice light puff paste^ coyer them with 
the same. Serve very hot. 

LEMON CHEESECAKES. 

Boil the rinds of two large lemons till tender, 
then pound them fine in a mortar, with a quarter 
of a pound of sugar, the yolks of six eggs, and 
a quarter of a pound of butter, with a little curd 
beaten fine ; pound all together till well mixed, 
line your small pans with puff paste, fill them 
half fuD, and bake them. Orange cheesecakes 
are made the same manner with Seville oranges, 
but the peels must be boiled in three or four 
waters to take off the bitterness, and they will 
require a little more sugar. 

ALMOND CHSEBECAKSS. 

Blanch and pound fine half a pound of sweet 
almonds with a little orange-flower water to pre- 
vent their oiling, take the yolks of six eggs and the 
whites of two, beat them well, and mix with the 



184 PASTRY. 

almonds, add half a pound of sagar with a little 
nutmeg grated, or mace pounded and sifted ; take 
a quarter of a pound of butter, melt it, grate a 
little lemon-peel, pound all in a mortar together ; 
Hne your little tart-pans with puff paste, fill them 
three parts full, and bake in a moderate oven. 
They ought to be a pale brown. Some only use 
the whites of eggs, which make them more deli- 
cate. 



CITEON CHEESECAKES. 

Boil a pint of cream, beat the yolks of two 
eggs, mix them with your cream when it is cold, 
then set it on the fire, let it boil till it curdles, 
blanch some almpnds, beat them with some 
orange-flower water, or a few drops of vanilla 
essence, put them to the cream with a few 
Naples biscuits grated, some citron cut in slices, 
sweeten to your taste,. line your little pans with 
puff paste, and fill them three parts full with 
the mixture, put a few strips of blanched almonds 
intermixed with citron in slices on the top of 
each as a garnish. These may be made with 
candied orange or lemon-peel in place of the 
citron. 



PASTRY< 185 

COENUCOPIAS A LA CEEME. 

. Have some tin moulds made in the shape of 
cornucopias, line them with paste, turning a bit 
oyer the moulds to form an edge ; when baked, 
fill them with a cream made like a rich custard, 
put them into the oven for a few minutes to 
dry, taking care they do not colour in the least. 



I need not give directions for making fruit 
tarts, as every one knows the method. Merely 
line your pans, whether large or otherwise, with 
puff paste; add your jam, or fresh fruit, and 
either cover the last, or put ornaments in paste 
on them or cross bar with paste. 

TOURTE DE MERINGUE. 

Line a round fiat mould about three inches 
deep with puff paste, on that place a layer of any 
kind of fruit you please, but it must be in 
marmalade, not with syrup, have the whites of 
three or four eggs or more, according to the 
quantity you require, beaten to a strong froth 
of snow. Add some sugar pounded rather 
coarsely, by degrees, still whisking; put this in 
a layer on the fruit, and put it a few minutes 



186 PA8TBT. 

into the oven to liarden; pat another layer of 
fruit lightly on the meringue^ and then another 
of the meringue^ again patting it into the oven 
to dry; do the same a third time, then take it 
oat of the moald, and put a light layer over the 
top and sides ; let it colour in the oven, ornament 
it as you please, and when cold it will be ready 
to serv6. The paste must be baked and cold 
before you begin this dish. 

AVOTHEE TOURT AU &HTJM. 

Make a paste, only more solid, like that of 
sponge-cake, pour a thin layer on your tart-pan, 
bake it, and take it out of the mould, put in some 
more, and bake as before, and have four or five 
cakes made, put a thin layer of any kind of pre- 
serves you like on one, and cover it, then put 
another layer of fruit, and so on till each cake is 
put on the other ; flatten them to make each stick 
closely, and if necessary, trim them with a sharp 
knife round the edges, pour a glass of rum over 
the top, and let it moisten ; ice it with a thin 
icing-stick, candied angeUca, in a star or any 
design you please, or ornament it in any way 
you like beat. Put it back into the oven for a 



PASTRY. 187 

few minutes to dry^ but not colour the icing. When 
eold it is fit for use. 

MEEINGUE A LA CB£M£. 

Have a high mould, any form you choose, 
butter it, and fill it with the preparation made 
as follows : Take the whites of some eggs, beat 
them with sugar to a strong high froth ; when 
well beaten and firm, line your mould with it, 
taking care to have a hollow in the middle, put 
it into the oven till it is dry, take it out, scoop 
out any soft part inside, then put it back again 
till a nice colour ; fill it with cream whipped to a 
mousse with any flavour you choose; have a 
cover made, and ornament it with the same mix- 
ture baked on a flat tin. This looks very well if 
made high. 

NOUGAT. 

Have tin i^apes made in the form of baskets, 
cornucopias, towers, or any other you please. 
Make your nougat as follows : — 

Blanch and cut fine some sweet almonds into 
four or five fillets,, put them on in a pan to 
colour, but take care they do not bum. Put on 
some sugar to melt, and when hot throw in your 
almonds also hot ; mix well together till a strong 



188 PASTRY. 

paste^ have your mould buttered^ and with a 
lemon and your hand press it into the mould to 
take the form ; put a thin layer of it. When 
all is in^ put it into the oven for a few minutes^ 
then take it out. When cold, take it out of the 
mould; if it is to be a very high piece, you 
must make it in separate pieces, and when cold, 
join them together firmly with a little hot nougat ; 
fill the basket with some plain biscuits as a foun- 
dation, and on that all sorts of glace fruit ; glaze 
the fruit again with caramel sugar. Nougat takes 
beautiful forms, is very strong, and makes a 
handsome piece montle for the centre of a supper- 
table. Great care must be taken in joining the 
pieces, and all must be glazed after it is joined. 

PASTES Am) JELLIES OF PAETRIDGB, QUAILS, 
WOODCOCKS, SNIPES, &C. 

Take a pheasant or partridge, and prepare it 
as for roasting, covering the breast with some 
slices of fat bacon, let it half roast at a slow fire, 
then take it off the spit, cut it into quarters, 
take out the bones, and pqund the meat with 
the bacon in a mortar till reduced to a paste. 
Pour over it a couple of glasses of good veal 
stock, then put it into a stewpan, and let it 



PASTRY. 189 

simmer slowly for two hours, moistening it from 
time to time with stock made of either veal or 
poultry, until the stock only covers the paste. 
Tou must pay great attention to the stirring it 
constantly, and let it simmer two hours ; then 
try your jelly by putting a drop on a plate to see 
whether it is done enough ; if it is, it will jelly, 
if not, you must let it simmer longer. If it 
stiffens at once on taking it off the fire, it is 
finished, for it spoils the quality of the jelly if 
left too long on the fire. To render your jelly 
clear and strong, you must pay attention to the 
following rules — to half roast your poultry only, 
and not to leave it too long on the fire, as 

» 

that would make it hard and have a bad 
taste. 

2nd. To pound it all equally, otherwise 
half the gravy will be left in the bones and 
skin, and some of the jelly be lost ; therefore, all 
the gravy must be extracted by force. 

3rd. To moisten with good stock the veal or 
poultry, and always to keep the meat covered 
with the gravy. By not attending to this, the 
meat will burn, and become dry and hard. 

4th. To stir it constantly, not [only to draw 
the gravy out of the meat, but to prevent 



190 PASTRY. 

the bottom being too hot. This will keep all of 
an equal heat. 

5th. Only to prepare your jelly on a gentle 
fire. This makes it have a better flavour, and 
richer. 

6th. Not to permit it to be too thick, for 
if so, it will soon lose its ^ good flavour, and turn 
sour. 

7th. When it jellies easily, pour it on a tamis 
to squeeze out all the gravy whilst it is hot, for 
the cold will render it difficult to strain when 
it has jellied. 

The meat may be squeezed through a linen 
cloth, as it can be with more strength than 
merely a sieve. 

ITALIAN PASTE. 

The following is a good manner of making 
it, with flour sufficient to form a good paste : 

Put into a stewpan one or two pounds of jelly, 
set it on a gentle fire, and when it has melted, 
shake in by degrees a little flour, stirring the 
jelly with a spoon in the other hand ; mix well 
as much flour as it will take, with an ounce of 
salt and an ounce of yeast ; take the stewpan off 
the fire, and turn out your paste on a paste* 



7A8TRY. 191 

boardj which must be heated by putting a pan 
of charcoal beneath it. Work it lightly^ paying 
attention to not making it too stiffs but rather a 
soft paste. Cover it with a cloth^ folded in four 
and heated^ after putting it into a basin ; let it 
stand an hour, and then use it for meat pies or 
patties. 

PATE A LA OELEE DE VOLAILLBS, POULAKDES, 

CAPONS, &C. 

To reduce poultry to jelly, begin by half- 
roasting it, and then cutting it into quarters and 
putting them into warm water. It is better to 
begin by roasting, as it makes the meat more 
tender and easier to reduce into jelly, and 
pay attention that the stewpan is not too 
large. 

Add, at the same time, half an ounce of harts- 
horn shavings, and let them stew with the 
poultry, as it will improve the jelly in strength 
and clear it. Let it stew four or five hours 
till it will jelly immediately on a plate^ then take 
it off the fire, take out the meat, and separate 
the meat from the bones ; pound the meat in a 
mortar, moistening it with some of the stock in 



192 PASTBT. 

which it was stewed ; and when it is reduced to 
a paste, pat it into a cloth, and sqneeze out all 
the gravy you can. This jelly is very nourishing 
for invalids. 

PATE DE SAUMON. 

Scale and cut the salmon into slices, make a 
stock with the trimmings and head, with a bay- 
leaf, an onion, some cloves and peppercorns; 
strain this when done, and put in your slices of 
salmon, with a glass of white wine, added to the 
stock. Let your salmon stew slowly till quite 
done enough, then take it off, and pound the 
fish to a paste, moistening it with the stock in 
which it was done, rub it through a tamis. 
Season to taste, and put it into little pots for 
use, which cover with melted butter. 

PATE DE TEUITES. 

Make a stock with the heads and trimmings 
of the trout as before. Then put, after straining 
the stock, into a stewpan your trout, adding 
some cloves, lemon-peel, two or three bay-leaves, 
a glass of white or Rhenish wine, let all stew slowly 
three hours, then take it off the fire, pound it 
fine with any seasoning you choose, and put it 



PASTES. 193 

in pots for use; you may either rub it through a 
tammy or uot^ according to your taste^ cover it 
with melted butter as before. This is very good 
at breakfie»t^ or as a cold entremet on a fast 
day. 

PATE d'aNGUILLES. 

After skinning your eels^ and cutting them in 
pieces, put them on to stew with a little water 
or fish stock, with some grated nutmeg, a blade 
or two of mace, two laurel-leaves and an onion 
or a clove of garlic ; let it stew three hours, then 
take it off, remove the bones, pound the meat 
with a glass of white wine, and seasoning to 
taste, put this paste into pots as before. 

PATE BE HOKASD. 

Take all the meat out of a ready-dressed 
lobster, pound it fine in a mortar, moistening 
it with a little melted butter, add some mace, 
pepper and salt to taste ; you must poimd the 
pea with it, as it improves the appearance ; put 
into pots as before, and cover with butter as 
before. Crabs and shrimps can be prepared in 
the same manner. Anchovy paste is made in 
the same manner, and also herrings are very 
good. 



194 PASTES. 

VEAL AND HAM PASTE. 

Take some dressed veal and ham^ and pound 
very fine, moistening with some butter melted, 
add some grated nutmeg, pepper, salt, and a 
little lemon-peel, put it on the fire, moistening it 
with a little good stock. When hot, press it into 
little pots, and let it cool, pour melted butter 
over it ; and when you use it, remove the grease, 
and turn it out of the mould. All these pastes 
can be turned out to be served, garnished with 
very green curled parsley, or anything else you 
please. 

BEEF PASTE 

Is prepared of any dressed beef you may have, 
in the same manner as the veal and ham. 

POULTRY. 

Chicken or turkey that has been dressed is 
very good prepared with ham, and adding a 
chopped truffle, a few mushrooms ; both must be 
dressed, and cold ; add some grated lemon-peel, 
pepper, salt, and a little pounded mace or grated 
nutmeg much as before, and put in small 
moulds. 



PASTES. 195 



RAISED PIES. 



Make a p&te bise^ as before directed^ and 
divide it into three parts^ one for the bottom, 
the second to raise the sides, and the third for 
the top. Cut out the paste for the bottom, and 
put it at the bottom of a large pie-dish, round 
or oval as you choose, lay on the paste some 
pounded bacon, then raise your wall round as 
follows : 

To make the wall or rather raise it, make 
your paste into a roll like a large sausage, 
flatten it with your hands, then roll it out to 
the size you wish in length and breadth ; to form 
a band three or four inches wide and rather 
thick, moisten the paste round the edge of the 
paste at the bottom, on which you place your 
band of paste perpendicularly to form your 
wall, observing to place it about half an inch 
inside the bottom paste, so as to form a border 
round it to make it solid. 

Make the border like a cord, and flatten it 
round the edge with your thumb, so that it shall 
be very thin round the bottom, then roll it like 
a little pipe round the wall, then with the edge 
of a knife make diagonal marks all round, 

o 2 



196 PASTES. 

which will show exactly the form of the cord^ 
and have a good effect. A little practice will 
make yoa expert in this; it should be rolled as 
nearly as possible the same size rounds as if this 
is not attended to it will look clumsy^ and the 
effect will be spoiled. 

Fill your pate with the meat you choose, 
taking care that it is all regularly placed, so that 
the pie should keep the proper form, then cut 
out the cover, but before you place it on the fire 
cover the meat with slices of fat bacon cut very 
thin, then put on the cover without pressing it 
down, and with sharp scissors cut it round the 
edges to the proper size. Keep all the pieces to 
roll out for the ornaments of the p&t6. 

Form a second border round the bottom, 
taking care to roll the second cord so as not to 
be confounded with the first. There are various 
modes of ornamenting the wall and the top of 
the pie. You use tin cutters for the leaves, 
flowers, and other ornaments, which must be left 
to taste according to the circumstances. When 
you have finished the ornaments, egg the whole 
over with beaten yolks of eggs ; put it on with a 
camel hair brush, taking care to . do all alike, 
otherwise it would not be the same colour. A 



FA8TRT. 197 

wood-fire heated oven is the best. It will take 
from four to five hours to bake. You must watch 
it from time to time to guard against burning. 

Make a hole in the top of the pie before you 
put it into the oven^ to prevent the paste crack- 
ing, turn it round constantly so that all sides may 
be done equally, but eiperience will direct this. 

SPICES MIXBD FOB SEASONING PATES. 

Take half a pound of pepper, two ounces of 
ginger, an ounce of cinnamon, six cloves, and an 
ounce of nutmegs grated. Pound all these apices 
separately, and then sift them through a tammy, 
pound any that are too coarse to go through, 
then mix all together, and add four pounds of 
salt to the spices. Bottle it for use and cork it 
closely. Keep it in a dry place. 



PATES DE VIANDE. 

PATES DE SANOLIEB, OB POBK. 

Choose a piece of pork or wild boar, without 
much fat, as it is very rich. If there is too much 
take off the outside skin, divide it into pieces 
and sprinkle pepper and salt over it, lard the 



198 FA8TET. 

pieces the next day that have no fat. Raise your 
pie as before directed, lay some prepared force* 
meat at the bottom on the paste, then lay your 
pieces of meat on it well seasoned, cover the meat 
with slices of fat bacon as before, and finish your 
pie as before directed. You must season this 
pie rather less than a venison pasty. 

VENISON PASTY. 

Bone a neck and breast of venison, season 
it with pepper and salt, put the meat into a

cover it with slices of fat bacon, finish it as* 
before, and serve both these p^tes cold. 

FATE BE B(EUF. 

Take some slices of beef, cut them in small 
pieces about three inches wide and a moderate 
length, season them with pepper and salt; you 
must first beat them to make the meat tender, 
let them remain till the next day, then lard them 
as you would a fricandeau of veal, which much

improves the flavour. Sprinkle some of the 
mixed spices^ and arrange them in your paste as 
before^ and finish the same. 

FATE DE LIEVRE* 

Choose a youngs tender^ fat hare^ skin and

FATES PE PEEDRIZ. 

Take two young partridges, clean and prqum 
them as if for roasting, flatten the breast-bones 
with a rolling-pin, lard them, and split them at 
the back. Make a good forcemeat with some 
veal and a little bacon, and the livers of the 
partridges, with some truffles and mixed 
spices. Stuff the partridges with this, but 
not too full, or they would burst as the farce 
swells. 

Make a p&te brisee, raise your pie as before, 
put a layer of the same farce as you stuffed your 
partridges with, lay these on this, cover them 
with slices of veal well larded, with a few bay 
leaves intermixed between the birds and meat, 
then cover, and finish as before. Egg over your 
paste, and let it bake in a moderate oven from 
two to three hours, according to the sise. When 
done, open it at the side, and pour in a little jus 
of partridges or fowl, and you may add some 
sweetbreads also if you like, all to be well sea- 
soned. Half a glass of white wine improves the 
flavour of the gravy. This pikte is equaUy good 
hot or cold. 

Woodcocks and snipe can be dressed in the

BASTBT. 201 

aame manner^ and also grouse and moor-fowl, 
following the same rales. A little lemon juice 
added to the wine is also an improvement, and 
use a very little Cayenne pepper with the mixed 
spices.

which they were stewed. When cold, put a 
layer of veal and ham in very thin slices, next a 
layer of forcemeat, the same as what they were 
stuffed with, put in the ducks, strain the gravy, 
and add half a glass of white wine. Four this in 
ov^ the ducks with bacon in thin slices, and put 
on the paste cover. The pie will take two hours 
to bake. A few truffles peeled should be put 
into the pie before it is baked, and a little gravy 
should be added when done if hked — ^it should 
be made with the livers and gizzards of the 
ducks, and any other giblets at hand, or if there 
are none, a bit of beef, about a quarter of a 
pound will be enough ; let this stew with a little

roasted and peeled, skin them, add three or four 
bay leaves, put in your fish rolled round, cover 
it, ornament it, and let the pate bake two hours

paste, egg it over, and put it in the oven, first 
squeezing in the juice of a lemon. When done 
serve hot. I think it will be better if a little 
sauce is made with some of the liquor of the 
oysters and a little cream, and put into the 
tourte before it is baked, as it prevents its being 
too dry. 

TOUBTE AUX MOULES.

it begins to whiten and to be very thick, pour in 
the juice of a lemon strained, and boil it quickly 
to caramel height, which you will know by the 
sugar beginning to look clear and have large 
bubbles on it, then you must add some drops 
of essence of lemon to it, to prevent its grain- 
ing, just as it is taken off the fire. Pour it on a 
dish or marble slab that has been oiled slightly

you like. The more you work the mixture the

any other essence you like.

of a pint of water, let it dissolve gently in a pre- 
aerving-pan, and boil till a dear syrup. Have 
ready a tea-spoonful of grated ginger, and mix it 
gradually with three or four tea-spoonsfiil of the 
syrup, and then stir it into the whole. Watch

it carefully, and when it begins to fall in flakes, 
throw in the freshly-grated rind of a lemon, and 
work the sugar round quickly as you add it, and 
keep stirring it round until it is done ; this will 
be when it falls in a mass from the spoon, then 
pour it out with a spoon and drop it in Uttle 
cakes or tablets on cold dishes, and before they 
are quite cold you can raise them from the dish 
to dry, but if touched when hot they will break. 
You can, in place of ginger, use essence of rose, 
chocolate in powder, coffee, lethon, balsam of 
tolu, or any other essence you please, following the 
same rules. Some drop them on buttered paper, 
and take them off before cold and dried before 
the fire. Should the candy turn to sugar before 
taken out, a little water must be added, and 
reboiled to the proper point. 

CHOCOLATE DBOPS. 

Break in a mortar that has been heated, with a 
hot pestle, some cake chocolate until it is a fine 
paste, add some vanilla essence, and work it 
well with an equal weight of sugar until well 
blended; then make it into balls, or little cakes, 
and lay them on sheets of writing-paper until 
cold, shake over them either nonpareil comfits

or coarse white sugar when they are warm or they 
will not stick. 

CHOCOLATE ALMONDS. 

When the chocolate has been softened as 
before directed^ put in the middle an almond 
that has been blanched^ or a pistachio nut^ and 
then work them into balls as before, and roll them 
in comfits or sugar. 

ALMOND LEAVES. 

Whisk the white of an egg to froth, then 
whisk into it half a pound of sifted white sugar 
or more if necessary, till you can work the mix- 
ture with your fingers. Have ready some 
blanched almonds that have been dried in an 
oven ; roll each of these in a small portion of the 
icing until it is covered equally and of equal 
form, then place them on thick writing-paper, 
placing three together in the form of a shamrock, 
with a small bit of sugar twisted from the centre 
almond to form the stalk; form others into a 
cross or star with four or six, twisting a small 
piece of sugar across the centre, or form them 
into love-knots according to taste ; bake them 
in a very slow oven for twenty. minutes; they

should be quite firm and white. You may add 
to the icing a little essence of orange-flower, or 
vanilla, or lemon. Pistachios are very good iced 
in this way, or even chestnuts. 

ALMOND OB PISTACHIO TABLET. 

' Boil together a pound of sugar for twenty 
minutes, and then stir in two ounces of almonds 
blanched, divided and dried, or pistachios. Let 
the sugar boil after they are added till it crackles 
when dropped in cold water and snaps between 
the teeth without sticking, then pour it into 
a tin mould oiled. When nearly cold, take 
it out — or a paper case might be made. A 
part of it might be taken out and worked white 
by putting in the almonds when soft. Very 
good. 

NOnOAT AU PARIS. 

Blanch some almonds — ^twelve ounces — wipe 
them very dry, spht them, and put them into 
an oven to heat ; boil to caramel six ounces of 
sugar, throw in the almonds hot, and mix them 
with the sugar; pour into your moulds, oiled 
sUghtly with butter or oil, the nougat, and

with a lemon quickly press it round the mouldy 
equally and very thin^ and let it cool. When 
quite cold, this is used in France for making les 
pieces montees, which are filled with glaee 
fruits. 

CROQUETTES EN BOUCHE. 

Take macaroons, ratifia, or other small cakes 
of an equal size, dip them into caramel sugar, 
and join them neatly in a mould. When cold, 
turn them out; and when you serve, fill the 
shape with glace fruit or what you please. Ghes- 
nuts can he joined after heing cut in half, or left 
whole at pleasure, and makes a pretty croque en 
bouche. All fruits can be glac6 by being dipped 
in caramel and allowed to dry — such as grapes, 
currants, plums, cherries, &c. ; and oranges, in 
slices, can be joined together on small rounds of 
paper, cut to the size and scalloped round the 
edge. This is a nice mode of serving oranges at 
a ball supper. 

ORANGE-FLOWER CANDY. 

Beat in three quarters of a pint of water the 
half of the white of an egg, and pour it on two 



SWEETMEATS. 227 

pounds of sugar broken in lumps. When it has 
stood a short time, put it on a clear fire, and let 
it boil up a few minutes, then set it aside till the 
scum has subsided, clear it ofi^, and boil the 
syrup till it is very thick, then add by degrees 
the petals of three ounces of orange-flowers. 
Stir the syrup till it becomes candy and rises in 
one white mass in the pan, and then pour it into 
paper cases, or drop it on dishes. The syrup 
must be three parts boiled before you add the 
orange-flowers, or they will turn brown. Lemon- 
peel grated may be added, carefully sprinkled 
over it, or it will be in a mass. Cocoa-nut may 
be grated and added in the same way, and 
almonds pounded, or pistachio nuts, which, from 
their colour, contrast well. 

ALMOND CAKES. 

Blanch seven ounces of sweet almonds and one 
of bitter, and dry them in a cool oven, then 
pound them to a paste with some orange-flower 
water ; then mix them well with a pound of flour 
and half a pound of butter^ add eight ounces of 
sifted sugar on which the rind of a lemon has 
been grated, make this into a paste with the yolks

of fbur eggs ; then make them into small cakes, 
and bake them on buttered tins in a slow oven 
till firm and crisp and a nice brown if not level, 
when hot put a tin plate over them^ and pnt a 
slight weight on them, when cold, they can be 
served as cakes, or a piece montee might be raised 
by spreading some rich preserve on each, and 
dishing them in a pyramid. Yon may roU some 
in balls and flatten them with the hand, egg them 
over and strew nonpareil comfits, coarse sugar, or 
sugar candy over them and bake as before; or, 
when baked, you may ornament them to taste 
with white or coloui^d icing. 

SUCBB DE FOMME A LA EOUEN. 

Boil some apples in water with some lemon-, 
peel till quite tender, but not to pulp ; strain the 
juice as you would to make jelly; measure it, 
and take three times the weight of the juice of 
sugar which you must boil to the grand casse, 
and stir it so that it does not stick to the sides. 
Four it oat on a marble slab, which must be 
oiled; when cool enough to touch, cut it out, roll 
it in sticks and roll them in sugar or leave them

plain, according to taste. If yon wish to make 
them large rolls, such as come from Rouen enve- 
loped in fancy papers and pictures, run the sugar 
into oiled moulds the size you wish, when cold 
take it up and then first roll lead-paper round 
them, and then put the fancy paper round. It 
is much prized as a honbon, and presented as a 
New Year's gift. 

SUCRE D^ORGE. 

Swell in a stewpan two ounces of barley, strain 
the water and melt in it six ounces of sugar ; let 
it boil to the grand casse, pour it on an oiled 
marble table, let it cool, then cut it with a pair 
of scissors and roll them on a slate ; add some 
vanilla, a lemon-peel when boiling, and squeeze 
in the juice of one or more lemons according 
to taste and the quantity you have.
