GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

For Cooking 

After you have decided which recipe you wish 
to use, read it over very carefully. Thrifty 
cooks decide in the morning what they will cook 
during the day and order what groceries are 
needed for all cooking. This avoids the shift- 
less habit of running to the grocery just be- 
fore mealtime. Sometimes, tho, a young cook 
decides to make something on the spur of the 
minute; it is all the more necessary then, that 
the cook read the recipe over with care and see 
that all materials required are at hand before 
actual cooking begins. If materials are not in 
the house, select some other recipe or market 
for what is needed. 

Notice the time mentioned for cooking and 
figure about how long before mealtime you 
should begin work. A beginner cook should 
allow plenty of time for preparations — at least 
t\vice as long as an experienced cook would take. 
This will avoid the last minute flurry that spoils 
many an otherwise good dish. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

When ready to begin cooking, read the recipe 
thru again and get out all materials required. 

Next get out all utensils needed and lay them 
on the table where they will be most conveniently 
at hand. 

If pans are to be greased or any material is 
to be ground, do that next. 

For the actual cooking, follow the directions 
given in the recipe step by step. If you measure 
accurately and do each step just in the order the 
recipe directs, you will have a successful result 
— you cannot fail. 

As soon as you are thru cooking, put your 
utensils to soak. Greasy dishes and tools soak 
in hot water; floury things go into cold water 
to dissolve the starch. A good cook always puts 
away materials, washes the dishes and tidies the 
kitchen ; then folks want her to come again. 

A\liile learning to cook, it is a good plan 
to make but one dish at a meal. As one gets 
more experience and learns to watch more than 
one thing, try two dishes and finally a whole 
meal. 

A girl or boy who leams how to cook plain, 
nourishing food is a good citizen. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS 



For Taking Care of This Book 

Every other page of this book is left blank 
so there Yvill be space for pasting in recipes that 
may be given by friends or may be read in the 
magazines. 

If the recipe is cut out of a magazine it can 
simply be pasted in — put it near the foods to 
which it belongs so it will be easy to find — but 
if the recipe is given you by someone, try to get 
a tyi^ewritten copy for pasting in your book. 
If that is impossible, write it in on the proper 
page, using your neatest hand writing and being 
sure you copy the amounts and directions 
exactly right. 

Never put a new recipe into your book till 
you have tried it once and have found that you 
like the product and that the recipe is complete 
and correct. 

A\Tien working in the kitchen, prop this book 
open at the back of the table where no drops 
from stirring materials can touch it. Never 
handle the book with floury or greasy hands. 

Most kitchen cabinets have a wire rack on the 
inside of the cupboard doors ; the cook book can 
be propped open behind this rack where it can 
easily be seen and referred to, and yet be high 
and dry and clean. 



PREFACE 

There has been a real demand for a book of 
cooking directions for young folks ; a book that 
concerned itself not so much with candy and 
*'miusual" desserts as with good, plain, nourish- 
ing food with directions so straightforward that 
any reader could understand. 

The recipes in this book are the result of 
much study and experiment with children. 
Every recipe given has been made by a child 
of twelve (or under) without any directions 
other than here given. The directions are given 
one step at a time — largely one sentence at a 
time — and nothing in the way of previous knowl- 
edge is taken for granted. By this method a 
young and ambitious cook may actually cook 
real food without the necessity of having a 
mother or other adviser right at hand while the 
work is going on. This independence is val- 
uable at any time, but in case of illness in the 
family or of the sudden absence of the house- 
keeper, a child may, with the help of this book, 
teach herself to cook and thus tide the family 
over an emergency. Boys as well as girls will 



PREFACE 

want to be self-helpf ul ; it may be well enough 
to have no knowledge of cooking at home, per- 
haps, but how about the camping trip or the 
house party f At such a time the boy who knows 
how to cook is easily the leader and is well re- 
paid in fun for his effort in learning. 

With the idea of helping toward this inde- 
pendence, a few menus are included at the end 
of the book, in order that the young cook may be 
guided toward knowledge of correct food com- 
binations. These are merely suggestive but 
will be found a real help if no' adviser is near. 

It Avill be noticed that there are an unusual 
number of recipes for cooking vegetables. Chil- 
dren do not know how vegetables should be pre- 
pared; yet fresh, well cooked vegetables are one 
of the cheapest and best of foods. By follow- 
ing the directions given here a young cook can 
greatly add to the variety of her menus. 

There are a considerable number of recipes 
for making ,iam. Some girls have found that 
they can make juin in vacation and sell it for 
pin money in the fall. Also, jam done up in 
nice paraffin covered glasses makes the nicest 
sort of a Christmas present, and the wise girl 
^^^ll use a part of her summer vacation in a 
profitable fashion. It is best to begin by making 
jam in small quantities, so all the recipes are 
planned for small amounts, but they are easily 



PREFACE 

doubled or increased still more when the cook 
has gained experience. 

Attention is also called to the large number of 
inexpensive dishes that have meat value — cheese 
dishes, egg dishes and dishes that call for a small 
amount of inexpensive meat. These foods -will 
be found ver\^ nourishing, tasty and inexpensive 
and many an older cook will be glad to use them 
in her menus.

MEATS, AND DISHES THAT HAVE 
FOOD VALUE OF MEAT 



f 



BACON OMELET 

Cut 3 slices of bacon into 4 pieces each. 

Put into a f I'^ang pan and set over a very low 
fire. 

Break and divide 3 eggs, putting the whites on 
a platter and the yellows into a bowl. 

With an Qgg beater beat the whites till they 
stand up firm and stiff. 

Turn the frying bits of bacon. 

Add 1 teaspoonful of salt and 

3 tablespoonsful of water to the yellows, 
and beat till smooth and creamy. 

Take up the bacon onto a warm platter. By 
this time the bacon should be nicely browned 
but not scorched. If not brown enough, increase 
the heat and while watching carefully let brown, 
then take up. 

Pour yellows into whites and beat three or 
four beats to mix as lightly as possible. 

Slide from the platter onto the frying pan. 

Watch carefully and when the egg is set firm 
at the sides loosen the cooked Qgg with a spatula 
so that it does not stick. 

17 



BACON Oi\li:i.ET 

Cook slowl}^ for 5 minutes and then set in a 
hot oven for 8 minutes. 

Remove from oven. (The handle of the pan 
will be very hot so be sure you have a good 
thick holder to protect your hand.) 

Arrange the pieces of bacon around the side 
of the platter; loosen the omelet at side of pan 
with your spatula and push it gently into the 
middle of the platter. 

Serve at once. 

You will notice that there is no difficult turn- 
ing of an omelet when it is cooked this way. 
This recipe will serve 4 persons and makes a 
fine breakfast or luncheon dish. Add 1/3 of the 
recipe for each additional person you may wish 
to serve. 



19 



CHEESE OMELET 

Open 4 eggs and divide the whites from the 
yellows putting them in separate bowls. 

Beat the whites till very stiff. 

Add 4 tablespoonsful of water, 
1 teaspooni'ul salt, 

1/4 teaspoonful pepper to the yellows and 
beat till smooth. 

Put 1 tablespoonful of meat drippings in a 
frying pan and melt till the bottom and sides of 
pan are well greased. 

Pour yellows onto stiff whites and beat gently 
till mixed. 

Put the pan over a slow fire and pour the eggs 
onto it when it is warm. 

Cook 5 minutes over a moderate fire. 

During this five minutes, slice 3 oz. of cream 
cheese into thin slices. 

When omelet has cooked 5 minutes lay the 
slices of cheese over the top. The whole omelet 
should be fairly well covered. 

Put the frying pan into the oven and bake the 
omelet till the cheese is melted to a tempting 
brown. This should take 12 or 15 minutes. 

21 



CHEESE OMELET 

Take from the oven. Be very careful to pro- 
tect your hands as the handle of the pan will 
be veiy hot. 

With a spatula, loosen the omelet around the 
edges. 

Slide it gently onto a hot platter ; garnish with 
a bit of parsley and ser^^e inmaediately. Notice 
that the omelet should slide onto the platter ; do 
not attempt to turn it over as that will make it 
heavy. 



23 



CKEAMED CHEESE ON TOAST 

Grate enough dry cheese to make a level table- 
spoonful. (Fresh cheese will do just as well 
but this is a good way to use up the dried bits 
that may be left over.) 

Put 4 tablespoonsful of butter (or substitute) 
into a saucepan mth 4 tablespoonsful of flour. 

Stir carefully and cook till a smooth paste is 
made. 

Stir in very gradually 2 cupsful of milk. 

Cook till smooth and creamy. If milk has 
been added gradually there will be no lumps. 

Add the grated cheese and cook slowly 3 
minutes. 

Draw pan away from the heat to where it will 
keep w^ann but will not cook any more. A good 
plan is to set the pan over a second pan filled 
with boiling water. 

Make six slices of toast. 

Put each piece of toast on a hot plate. 

Ladle the creamed cheese over the -hot toast 
and serve immediately. This amount of cheese 
could be made to serve 8 pieces of toast if de- 
sired. 

This is a very good luncheon or breakfast 
dish. 

25 



CORN OYSTERS 

Cut the com off of 2 medium sized ears. 

(1 cupful of canned com or the com cut off 
2 left over ears of boiled corn will be almost as 
nice, in case fresh, uncooked ears are not avail- 
able.) 

Break 2 eggs into a bowl. 

Measure 1 teaspoonful of salt and 
4 level tablespoonsful of flour and beat in 
with the whole eggs till the mixture is 
smooth and creamy. 

Drop the cut off corn into the egg mixture and 
beat lightly again. Use a large fork for beat- 
ing. 

Put two tablespoonsful of meat drippings into 
a frying pan and heat. 

When grease is very hot put in the egg and 
com mixture, 1 tablespoonful at a time. 

Brown lightly on one side and then turn with 
pancake turner and bro^vn on the other. It is 
better to cook about 5 ''oysters" at a time so 
that you can watch each one and cook it a perfect 
and even brown. 

Take these up onto a hot platter. 

Put 1 tablespoonful more fat into the pan 
27 



CORN OYSTERS 

and cook five more. The recipe makes about 10 
"oysters." 

This is a delicious dish for breakfast or lunch- 
eon during the season of fresh com and, by 
using canned com, can be made at any time of 
year. 



29 



BROILED OYSTERS ON TOAST 
Tliis is a fine recipe for Sunday evening tea. 

Have ready 1 pint of oysters, 
6 large or 12 small pieces of bread, 
2 tablespoonsful of butter, 
salt and pepper. 

When everything else about the tea is ready to 
sei-ve, toast the bread, being careful to brown the 
second side of each piece only slightly. 

Lay the toast, lightly browTied side up, in a 
big, shallow cookie pan. 

Lay the oysters on the toast, dividing so that 
each piece gets an equal share with each other 
piece. 

Cut the butter into tiny bits and drop over the 
toast. 

With a salt and pepper shaker, daintily season 
the oysters. 

Slip the pan into the broiler and cook till the 
edges of the oysters are curled. 

Sei*ve at once. 



31 



SUNSHINE EGGS 

Boil 3 eggs for 20 minutes. 

Drop the cooked eggs into cold water for five 
minutes. 

Peel off the shells. The cold water makes the 
shells come off quickly and neatly. 

Cut each egg into half, longways. 

Take out the yellows and drop them into a 
bowl. 

With a fork, break up the yellows till they 
look like fine meal. 

Add y^ teaspoonful of salt and 1 salt spoon 
of pepper and mix well with the yellows. 

Melt 2 tablespoon sful of butter substitute in 
a sauce pan. 

Add 2 tablespoonsful of flour and i/4 teaspoon- 
ful of salt and mix with the melting butter. 

Let this cook very slowly and stir all the time. 

When butter and flour are a smooth paste 
begin to pour on 1 cupful of milk. Stir all the 
time and add the milk very slowly so that it 
will cook in well. Stir and cook slowly till all 
the cupful of milk is blended in with butter and 
flour. 

33 



SUNSHINE EGGS 

Draw away from lire to where cream will keep 
waiTH but will not scorch. 

Make six slices of toast. 

Cut each egg white into 4 long strips. 

Arrange strips on toast, 4 to each piece. 

Pour the cream made of butter, flour and milk 
over the six slices dividing it as evenly as pos- 
sible. 

With a spoon sprinkle the crumbled yellows 
over the cream and serve at once, as it must be 
very hot to be tasty. A shake of paprika, if 
liked, makes a pretty bit of garnish to each piece. 



85 



SCRAMBLED EGGS 

Break 2 eggs into a small bowl. 

Add 1/2 saltspoonful of pepper, 
14 teaspoonful of salt, and 
1 cupful of milk. 

Beat with a fork till foamy. 

Melt 1 teaspoonful of meat drippings, lard, or 
oil in a small frying pan. 

Pour the egg and milk mixture into the pan. 

With the fork toss the egg lightly while it 
cooks over a slow fire. 

When the egg is almost set firm, turn it quickly 
onto a hot platter or serve directly onto warm 
plates. 

This is a very tasty and economical way to 
cook eggs, as this amount, only 2 eggs, will serve 
4 people. 

If desired the egg may be taken up on small 
pieces of toast. 



37 



BAKED SAUSAGE WITH VEGETABLES 

Buy 8 links of small link sausage. 

Wash and put in pan with 1 cup of water. 

Boil for 20 minutes. 

Grease a baking dish with meat drippings or 
oil. 

Measure out 3 cupsful of cooked rice. 
Mashed or boiled potatoes diced or cooked maca- 
roni or spaghetti will make a nice dish too, but 
rice is the best. 

1 cupful of tomatoes cut fine or % cupful 
of tomato juice. 

2 onions cut up fine (this may be omitted if 
onion seasoning is not desired). 

Any left over vegetables such as peas, 
carrots, beets or the like to the amount of 
2 cupsful may be used if desired. 
Put a layer of rice in the baking dish. 
Lay 4 of the cooked sausages over rice. 
Put half the vegetables over meat. 
Arrange another layer of rice, sausage and 
vegetables. 

Put remainder of rice over the top. If rice 
(or its equivalent) was not seasoned enough 

39 



BAKED SAUSAGE WITH VEGETABLES 

when cooked add 2 teaspoonsful of salt by 
sprinkling over the top of all. 

Put 2 cupsful of water over all and bake for 
35 minutes. (If any water was left from cook- 
ing sausages, it should be used as part of this 2 
cupsful.) Serve hot. This is ample for 4 peo- 
ple and will make a whole meal, as meat and 
vegetables are all together. 



41 



CREAMED DRIED BEEF ON TOAST 

Buy 1/4 pound of dried beef. 

Tear into small shreds. 

Put 2 tablespoonsful of meat drippings into 
a frying pan. (Vegetable oil or lard may be 
used if preferred. Butter is very delicious but 
makes the cost higher.) 

Drop the shredded meat into the fat and toss 
well. 

Put over a vslow fire and cook till meat begins 
to brown a very little. 

Measure 3 tablespoonsful of flour, 

1 saltspoonful of pepper onto a plate. 

Slide the flour and pepper over the browning 
meat and toss till flour too, begins to get a little 
browned. 

Very slowly, stirring all the while, pour over 
the cooking meat 1 pint (2 cupsful) of milk. 

Stir till smooth and creamy. 

Have ready small pieces of toast — 1 for each 
person to be served. 

Arrange toast on a hot platter or on individual 
plates. 

With a large cooking spoon serve the meat, 
43 



CREAMED DRIED BEEF ON TOAST 

putting 1 or more spoonsful on each piece of 
toast. This recipe will serve 4 or 5 people. 
Garnish with a bit of green and serve at once. 

This is very nice to serve at luncheon or at 
dinner with mashed potatoes instead of toast. 



45 



DEVILED EGGS 

Put 6 eggs into a saucepan. 

Cover with water, bring to a boil and boil for 
20 minutes. 

Pour off hot water and cover at once with 
cold water till the eggs are cool. This sudden 
change from hot to cold water will make the 
shells come off easily, and neatly. 

Cut the eggs, when shelled, into halves, long- 
wise. 

Take out the yellows into a bowl. Lay the 
empty white halves on a plate till needed for 
filling. 

Into the bowl in which you have put the 
yellows put 1 tablespoonful vegetable oil. (Use 
melted butter if you have no vegetable oil.) 
2 teaspoonsful vinegar, 
Yo teaspoonful salt, 
14 teaspoonful pepper, 
1/4 teaspoonful ground mustard. 

Mix together by mashing with the back of a 
spoon till the mixture is smooth and creamy. 

Fill the white shells with the yellow mixture, 
packing neatly so that the shells are rounded full 
without smearing. 

47 



DEVILED EGGS 

If the eggs are wanted for picnic use, fit two 
stuffed halves together, fasten with a smooth 
toothpick and wrap neatly in paraffin paper. If 
they are prepared for home use, leave the halves 
separate; arrange them neatly on a platter, 
yellow part up : put a border of lettuce or pars- 
ley around the edge and serve very cold. 



49 



HAM AND EGGS, JUNIOR FASHION 

Recipe for four persons. 

Use 1/4 pound boiled ham cut with slicer No. 
4. This should make 4 nice sized pieces. 

4 eggs. 

Lay slices of ham in a f rjdng pan and brown 
daintily over a slow fire. 

Take up on a warm platter being sure that 
the slices keep their shape. 

Drop 4 eggs, one at a time, into the pan and 
cook till the edges get frilled and browned. 

(To break the eggs, knock an egg on the side 
of the table or of a pan. Insert right thumb in 
crack. With fingers of both hands pull shell 
apart and drop egg gently into a dish. Slide 
egg from dish into f lying pan and continue with 
second egg. By keeping each egg separate 
from the others an old egg may be discovered 
and thro^v^l out without damaging others.) 

If hard eggs are liked turn each egg over with 
pancake turner and cook again. 

Take up into platter and garnish with a bit of 
parsley or lettuce. 

Serve at once. 

51 



MEXICAN LAMB, EN CASSEROLE 

Take 2 cupsful of cooked lamb cut into small 
pieces before measuring. 

2 small dried onions, cut very fine, 
1 cupful of cooked carrots, sliced, 
1 green pepper, cut into long strips, 
1 cupful of cooked rice, 
Any leftovers of tomato, peas or lamb 
grav^^ on hand may also be used, and will add to 
the flavor. 

Measure out 1 tablespoonful flour, 
1 teaspoonful of salt and 
1 salt spoonful of pepper and mix together 
dry ready for use. 

Grease the sides and bottom of a casserole 
dish, or any good baking dish, with meat drip- 
pings or oil. 

Put in a layer of meat and rice and vegetable 
and sprinkle i^ the flour, salt and pepper over 
all. 

Put in a second layer of meat and rice and 
vegetables and sprinkle on the second half of 
the seasonings. 

53 



MEXICAxX LAMB, EN CASSEROLE 

Put 2 tablespoonst'ul of ketchup over the top. 
(If any tomato has been used this may be 
omitted if desired.) 

Pour over the whole dishful 2 cupsful of hot 
water. 

Sprinkle bread or cracker crumbs over the 
top and bake 35 minutes. 

Serve hot. This is enough for five people. 

This is a very economical and delicious way 
to use up the last bits of a large lamb roast. As 
meat and vegetables are all in the one dish it, 
with the addition of a salad or desert, makes a 
whole meal. 



^5 



MEAT LOAF 

Buy 11/2 pounds of beef and 1/0 pound of 

fresh pork, ground together. 
Measure out 2 cupsful of bread crumbs, 
1 cupful of milk, 
1 tablespoonful salt (be sure this is level 

only), 
1/2 teaspoonful pepper. 
Crack 1 egg and drop into saucer. 
Cut up 1 green pepper (this may be omitted 
if out of season). 
1 dried onion. 
Put meat into a large mixing bowl. 
Put all ingredients in with the meat reserving 
14 cupful of crumbs for later use. 
Add 2 tablespoonsful of ketchup. 
Wash your hands carefully with soap an.l 
dry well. 

Prepare a baking pan by greasing with meat 
drippings. 

With both hands mix the meat and ingredients 
till all are well worked together. This may be 
done with two big forks but a much better result 
is obtained if hands are used. 

57 



MEAT LOAF 

Lay the meat loaf, when well mixed, in the 
bakiiiti: pan. Press firmly till neatly shaped. 

Sprinkle i/4 cupful of bread crumbs over the 
top. 

Bake in moderately hot oven for 50 minutes. 

This recipe may be molded into 2 loaves and 
then will bake in 35 minutes — a sa\dng of gas. 

Kemove from ovon. 

With a spatula loosen from the baking pan. 

Slide onto a warm platter, garnish with a bit 
of green and serve at once. 

This amount \\all serve 4 people for at least 
2 meals ; for use the second meal the meat may 
be sliced cold or carefully reheated. 



59 



SAKDINES ON TOAST 

Open a can of sardines according to the direc- 
tions given on the can, and pour the contents 
onto a plate. 

Toast four pieces of bread a very light brown. 
White bread is nice for this but if the family 
like an occasional change this is a good time to 
make rye bread toast. 

Arrange 2 sardines on each piece of toast — 
opening each tiny fisli, removing the center 
bones and laying the fish in neat fashion on the 
toast. 

Lay the covered toast on a shallow pan. 

Set the pan in a moderately hot oven for 5 
minutes. 

Serve at once. 

This is a very nice dish for breakfast or 
luncheon. 



61 



VEGETABLES 



FRESH TOMATOES ON TOAST 

Make 4 pieces of toast. 

Slice a large tomato into 4 even slices. 

Lay 1 piece in tlie center of each piece of toast. 

Put y^ teaspoonful butter, 
1 saltspoonful salt and 
1 dash of pepper on each slice of tomato. 

Put in a shallow pan and set in a moderately 
hot oven for 5 minutes so that the tomatoes will 
get hot. 

Serve at once. 

This is a very delicious dish for a summer 
breakfast or luncheon. 

A bit of cheese grated onto the tomato is liked 
by some and adds to the food value of the dish. 



65 



BUTTERED BEETS 

Wash 2 bunches of beets very carefully. 

If the tops are free from holes made by in- 
sects, wash those; put into water for an hour 
and cook for greens. If the tops are much 
eaten, as beet-tops bought at a grocery some- 
times are, do not try to use them. 

Gut the tops off about 4 inches from the root. 

Put the beets (with this 4 inches of stem at- 
tached) into a saucepan. 

Cover with boiling water and boil till tender. 
To tell when beets are tender, prick gently with 
a fork. When the beets are done, the fork will 
easily run way into the beets. Small, young 
beets will cook in 30 minutes ; old beets of large 
size Tsdll need at least 1 hour. Never test beets 
till they have cooked what you think should be 
about enough, as pricking them needlessly will 
spoil the pretty red color. Watch the amount 
of w^ater if the beets have to cook long, and pour 
on more if too much boils away. Beets will 
scorch easily if the water boils away. 

When they are done, remove at once from the 
fire. Pour off the hot water and cover at once 

67 



BUTTERED BEETS 

with cold water. This will loosen the skins. If 
plenty of running water is at hand, set the pan 
full of beets and hot water under the cold w^ater 
faucet and let the cold water run until the beets 
are cold. Then there is no danger of burning 
fingers in pouring ot¥ the boiling water. 

As soon as beets are cool, cut off 3 inches of 
the stems and arrange neatly in a dish. 

Then skin the beets (the skin mil pull right 
off in the fingers), slice them and arrange them 
on top of the beet stems. 

Sprinkle with 1 teaspoonful salt. 

Pour over all 2 tablespoonsful melted butter. 

Serve hot. 

If any beets are left over a half cupful of 
vinegar may be added to make pickled beets for 
the next day's dinner. 



69 



BAKED CORN 

Measure 3 cupsful of corn cut from the cob. 
Fresh uncooked corn is best but the dish is very 
nice if left-over, cooked corn is used. If fresh 
com is not in season the recipe may be made 
with 1 can of canned corn. 

Shake 1 tablespoonful of flour over the com 
and toss with a fork till the flour is well mixed 
mth the corn. 

Beat 1 egg till light. 

Add 1 teaspoonful salt, 

1 pint (2 cupsful) milk and beat again. 

Grease a baking dish. 

Mix the com and egg with milk and beat 1 
minute. 

Pour into the baking dish and bake 25 min- 
utes. 

If mango peppers are hked % pepper may be 
cut up and mixed with the corn. Also a left- 
over piece of celery, cut very fine, makes a nice 
bit of seasoning either with or without the 
pepper. Save the other half of the pepper for 
salad or to season a meat loaf.

DANDELION GREENS 

The jolly part of serving dandelion greens 
comes in the fun of getting them. Some 
Saturday morning in the early spring, or some 
night after school, take a basket and a trowel or 
old knife and start out after greens. The dan- 
delions should be cut off about an inch below 
the level of the ground and they should be cut 
before the plant blossoms. After blossoming 
the greens are more apt to be bitter. 

At meal time, wash the greens very carefully. 
Use 2 or 3 changes of water and be sure to get 
all the grit and sand washed away. 

Put about 3 quarts of greens in a kettle. 

Add 1 pint of water and cover very closely. 
If the kettle is very closely covered the greens 
will cook in this small amount of water and will 
be a much finer flavor than if a lot of water is 
used. 

Cook for 20 minutes. 

Cut up 4 pieces of breakfast bacon into tiny 
bits. 

Fry till delicately brown. 

Drop the bacon bits on top of the greens, pour 
73 



DANDELION GREENS 

the fat that has fried out over the top and cook 
for 5 minutes. 

Season with 1 teaspoonful of salt just before 
sei'ving. 

(The water should have about boiled away. 
If any should be left, do not save it.) 

Serve hot. Many like a seasoning of vinegar 
at the last minute. 

If any greens are left over they may be used 
in a combination salad. 



75 



CREAMED GREEN ONIONS ON TOAST 

This is a very good vegetable dish to serve in 
the springtime when the green onions in your 
garden are growing too fast for salad use, or 
when the large bunches of onions on the mar- 
ket are cheap and plenty. 

Wash the onions. 

Cut off the root end and the top 2 inches above 
the beginning of the green part. 

Put 2 dozen onions on to boil in a pint of 
boiling water. 

Boil for 15 minutes. 

Add 1 teaspoonful of salt and cook 5 minutes 
more. 

Drain off the water and save it for soup stock. 

Make a white sauce this way : 

Put 2 tablespoonsful of butter substitute in 
small saucepan over the fire. 

When butter is melted add 2 tablespoonsful of 
flour. 

Stir carefully and cook till smooth. 

Stir in very gradually 1 cupful of milk and 
cook slowly till smooth and creamy. 

Make 4 pieces of toast. 
77 



CREAMED GREEN ONIONS ON TOAST 

Put 6 cooked onions on each piece of toast. 

Pour the cream sauce over the toast and 
onions and serve at once. 

Plan to make the white sauce while the onions 
are cookins: the 15 minutes. Draw the sauce 
hack where it will keep hot but will not scorch ; 
season the onions and then the last 5 minutes 
make the toast. In this way it will all be done, 
and hot, at the same time. 



79 



ESCALLOPED OYSTER PLANT 

Wash the oyster plant and put it in a deep 
panful of water. 

With the hands all the time under water, cut 
off the stem and tip root end and scrape the 
skin. By working under water the hands are 
not stained and the vegetable does not turn dark 
and unsightly. 

Slice in thin slices and drop into another pan- 
ful of water. 

When all has been skinned and sliced, wash in 
two changes of water. 

Cover with boiling water and boil for 5 min- 
utes. 

Pour off the water. 

Grease a baking dish with meat dripping or 
butter. 

Put in a layer of oyster plant. 

Sift together i/o cupful of flour with 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt and 14 teaspoonful pepper. 

Sprinkle part of this flour mixture over the 
oyster plant. 

Put in another layer of oyster plant and an- 
other layer of seasoned flour. 

81 



ESCALLOrKJ) OYSTER PLANT 

There should be about 4 layers with flour on 
the top of the last layer. 

Pour 1 1/. cupsf ul of milk over the whole dish- 
ful and bake 45 minutes. 

A very easy and delicious way to cook a little 
used, but very cheap and wholesome, vegetable. 



83 



YOUNG LETTUCE FROM YOUR GARDEN 

When the lettuce in the garden grows too thick 
and fast, thin it out by pulling a panful of the 
biggest leaves. 

Wash carefully, leaf by leaf, drain, and cut or 
tear into small pieces. 

Cut four thin slices of bacon into six pieces 
each. 

Drop these pieces into a frying pan and brown 
nicely over a slow fire. 

Cut up one small onion and brown with the 
bacon if onion flavor is enjoyed. 

Toss till browned and then pour on 1 cup of 
vinegar. 

While this slowly heats arrange the lettuce in 
a serving dish. 

Pour the boiling hot vinegar, with the bacon 
bits and onion, over the lettuce and serve at 
once. 



85 



EICED POTATOES 

Scrub 8 medium sized potatoes. 
Put in a saucepan and cover with boiling 
water. 

Boil till skins break — about 25 minutes. 
Pour off water at once. 
Peel potatoes by stripping off loosened skins. 
Put thru a potato ricer into a baking dish. 
Put 1/2 cup milk. 

2 teaspoonsful butter. 
1 teaspoonful salt 

into a small pan and heat till steaming 
hot. 
Pour this over the potatoes. 
Put potatoes in hot oven for 15 minutes and 
then serve at once. 



87 



TASTY SPINACH 

Material : 
y^y peck spinach. 

4 thin slices of bacon or an equal amount of 
salt pork. 

1 hard boiled q^^,. 
1 teaspoonful salt. 

Wash spinach carefully. 

Cut off coarse root end. 

Wash again to be sure all sand is removed. 

Pry bacon at the bottom of a kettle, or large 
pan, till all fat is cooked out but the bacon is 
not yet brown. 

Pour Vj cupful of water over the bacon. 

Drop spinach lightly into th« kettle and cover 
at once. 

Cook till tender. The fire should be very 
moderate so that cooking takes about 30 min- 
utes. Hard cooking spoils the flavor and too 
much water spoils the food value of the spinach. 

The water should have about boiled away in 
30 minutes so that the spinach can be served 
at once without draining. 

Add salt just before serving. 

Garnish with slices of hard boiled q^^ and 
serve at once.

91 



POTATO CAKES 

Scrub 5 medium sized potatoes. 

Put in a pan and cover with boiling water. 

Boil till skins break — will take about 25 min- 
utes. 

Pour off the water at once. 

Peel off skins. (Stick a large fork in the po- 
tato and strip off" loosened peeling with small 
knife. 

Put peeled potatoes thru a ricer. 

Add V2 teaspoon salt, 
1/4 cup milk, 
1 teaspoonful butter and beat well. 

Drop one tablespoonful at a time onto a fry- 
ing pan which has been well greased with meat 
drippings. 

When brown around the edges, turn over with 
a pancake turner and brown on other side. 

Serve at once on a warm platter. Tliis makes 
6 or 8 cakes. 



93 



LUNCHEON POTATOES 

Scrub 4 large potatoes. 

Cut in halves the long way. 

Arrange in a shallow pan the cut side up. 

Lay a slice of cream cheese on the cut side of 
each potato. 

Sprinkle daintily with salt. 

Put in the oven and bake for 35 minutes. 

Serve at once. 

These are easy to fix and are very nour- 
ishir.g. Can be used at any meal but are par- 
ticularly good for luncheon, as the cheese makes 
them take the place of both meat and potato.

BREADS, MUFFINS, WAFERS 
AND COOKIES 



BROWN BREAD 

Put 1 ciir)ful of molasses (cooking syrup, very 
(lark brown color), 

1 teaspoonful salt, 
Y_> tea spoonful soda 
In a saucepan and cook over a slow fire till it 
bubbles up. 

Stir 3 or 4 times and remove from fire. 
Dissolve V-^ teaspoonful soda in 

1 pint (2 cupsful) of sour milk or butter- 
Biilk. 
Stir till foamy. 

Add this to the molasses and stir 3 or 4 times. 
Sift 1 y^ cupsful of flour with 

1 teaspoonful baking powder and spread on 
a plate. 
Put 1 cupful of raisins (seeded) on this plate 
and with a fork, toss till all the raisins are cov- 
ered with flour. 

Grease 2 bread tins; cut papers to fit the bot- 
toms; grease papers. Note that the grease 
should be both above and below the paper. The 
best way of greasing a pan is to apply the 
grease, or oil, with a brush kept for that pur- 

99 



BROWN BREAD 

pose. If there is no brush at hand use a clean 
bit of yellow paper on which there is no printing. 
If greasing is done right tho. hands can be kept 
tidy and clean. 

Put V/4 cupsful of bran 
1 cupful of commeal into the molasses and 
milk and stir. 

Add the flour and raisins and beat well. 

Pour the dough (which will look rather thin) 
into the two pans, dividing equally. 

Bake in rather slow oven for 50 minutes. 

T)o not cut till cold. This broad is fine for 
sandwiches as well as for serving plain. 



101 



CORN BREAD 

Mix together 2 tablespoonsful of fat (lard, 
vegetable oil or meat drippings will make good 
corn bread), 

1 tablespoonful sugar, 

y2 teaspoonful salt, 

1 Ofrcr 

Boat till smootl). 

Measure out 1 1/. cupsful sour milk or butter- 
milk. 

Add Vii teaspoonful soda to the milk and stir 
till foamy. 

Pour this onto the first mixture and stir 
lightly. 

Sift 1 teaspoonful baking powder with 

I'/j cupsful flour. 

Add this flour and 

11/2 cupsful conimeal to the dough and stir 
till well mixed. 

Grease a large shallow baking pan and pour 
the cornmeal dough in, spreading it out well so 
that the whole large f)an is evenly covered. 

Bake for 20 minutes in a moderately hot oven. 
103 



CORN BREAD 

In serving the corn bread be sure to break it 
apart instead of cutting it. Corn bread should 
be served very hot, and cutting hot bread makes 
it heavy and [)oor. 

Yellow cornmeal makes the prettiest ooni 
bread. 

Tn times of year when eggs are very high the 
o<^}^ may be omitted from this recipe. P>ut wiili 
the eg^, the bread is a little finer, richer and 
more nourishing. 

Served with strips of well cooked bacon and 
greens ol" some sort, corn bread makes a com- 
plete meal. 



105 



POPOVERS 

Grease a muffin tin of 8 rings very carefully 
and put it in the oven so it will get hot. 

Put into a mixing bowl 1 eggj 
1 cupful milk, 
1 cupful flour, sifted twice, 
l^ teaspoonful salt. 

Beat till creamy and smooth. 

Drip the dough, which is very thin, into the 
muffin rings which by now should be very hot. 
Divide the dough as evenly as possible so that 
the popovers will bake in the same length of 
time. 

Put in a hot oven and bake 20 minutes or 
untd the popovers pop away up and get nicely 
brown. 

Take from the pan very quickly and serve im- 
mediately. To be successful popovers must be 
served while very fresh and hot. 

Popovers are supposed by some to be very 
hard to make but if tliese simple rules are fol- 
lowed success is sure. They make a fine break- 
fast or luncheon dish. 

The recipe may be doubled for a larger 
amount.

CORN FLOUR MUFFINS 

Sift together two times, 
1 cupful wheat flour, 
1 cupful corn flour, 
'.] level teaspoonsful baking powder. 

Drop 2 tablenpoonsful of very cold fat into 
this sifted mixture and with the tijjs of the 
fingers work the fat into the flour till it is all 
evenly flaky. (For fat, lard, vegetable oil or 
butterine may be used.) 

Pour % cup of milk into this mixture and 
with a fork toss about lightly in the bowl till 
the milk and flour are well mixed. This must 
be done quickly and with a tossing, not a 
stirring, motion. 

Put the dough on a floured board. 

With the fingers well covered with flour pat 
the dough till it is only about % inch thick. 

Cut out small biscuits with a biscuit cutter 
and place them in neat rows in a floured pan. 

P)ake 20 minutes. 

This is a very good biscuit to ser\^e with a 
meat dinner. 

Ill

number of small biscuits are v(!ry nice. 
Measure out 1 cupful of milk. 
Pour the milk into the mixture of Hour and 
fat and, using a big fork, work it (|uicl<ly into a 
soft dough. 

Take a big spoon and drop spoonsful into the 
mulTin pans. Divide the dough evenly so that 
biscuits are about even size but work as quickly 

113 



SPOON BISCUIT 

as possible, for the baking powder begins to act 
as soon as the milk is in the dough. 

Bake 18 minutes in a hot oven. In case the 
recipe is divided into 12 large biscuits, bake 20 
minutes. 

This is the same as baking powder biscuits 
except that the dough is made softer so that it 
can be dropped from a s[)oon instead of being 
rolled out on a board. These spoon biscuits are 
much easier for a junior cook to make. 



115 



CINNAMON TOAST 

Cut 6 thin slices of bread. 

Measure out V2 teaspoonful of ground cin- 
namon 
2 teaspoonsf ul of granulated sugar. 

Mix the sugar and cinnamon in a small dish. 

Toast the bread on one side. 

Spread the untoasted side mth butter and 
sprinkle with the sugar-cinnamon mixture. 

Toast this side. This is most satisfactory if 
the toast is made under a broiler. If you make 
toast on an electric toaster or with a fork over 
a fire, it is best to toast both sides and then 
butter and sugar the bread and set it in a hot 
oven to melt the sugar. 

Serve at once. 

This is fine to eat after school or to make as 
a surprise for mother when she has a caller to 
tea. It is also good to serve with sandwiches at 
a party. 



117 



CHEESE WAFERS TO SERVE WITH 
SALAD 

Lay 2 dozen crackers in neat rows in a cookie 
pan. 

Slice American cheese into very thin slices. 

Lay 1 piece of cheese on each cracker. (If 
slices are too large, break in two as no cheese 
should lay over the edge of the cracker.) 

Put in a moderate oven till cheese melts — this 
will take six or seven minutes. 

Serve while hot with a salad. 

Or the crackers may be taken from the pan, 
cooled and wrapped in oiled paper for picnic 
use. 

Square crackers are the best shape for this 
recipe as they hold the cheese neatly. 



119 



MARSHMALLOW CRACKERS 

Arrange 2 dozen square crackers in a shallow 
pan. (The crackers commonly known as *'soda 
crackers" are best.) 

Lay 1 marshmallow in the center of each 
cracker. 

Put the pan in a moderately hot oven and bake 
crackers till marshmallows are lightly browned. 
It is necessary to watch the marshmallows 
closely as the fine flavor is spoiled if they get 
too brown. 

Take pan from the oven. 

Remove the crackers from the pan with a pan- 
cake turner. Arrange on a plate or cake basket 
and serve at once. 

These are nice to use for a dessert or with 
cocoa and sandwiches at an afternoon party. 



121 



HURRY-UP MACAROONS 

Put 1 cupful of su^ar, 

1 tablewpoonful of butter substitute, 
the yolks of 2 eggs into a mixing bowl. 
Beat till creamy. 
Add 1 teaspoonful of vanilla and 

1 tablespoon ful of milk and beat again. 
Then add 2 cupsful of cornflakes, 
V'l cupful of raisins, 

1^ cupful of nut meats (these may be 
omitted if they are too expensive). 
Mix well. 

Beat the whites of 2 eggs till stiff. 
Fold — not beat but joid with a very gentle 
motion — the whites into the other mixture. 

Drop a teaspoonful at a time on a buttered 
tin. 

Bake in a moderate oven till nicely brown. 
Do not put too close together, as cookies will 
spread a little in cooking. 

These are fine to use for a party at home or at 
school.

RICE COOKIES 

Remove from the pan with a spatula and lay 
on a clean napkin till cool. 

These are delicious to serve with iced tea or 
iced cocoa in the summer time. 



127 



CHRISTMAS STARS 

This is a very fine Christmas cookie. 

Sift together y> pound of sugar and 
V2 pound of flour. 

(Weigh these two materials if possible; if 
you have no scales use ly^ cups of sugar and 
2 cups of flour.) 

Measure out i/4 pound of butter substitute 
and lay it on top of the sugar and flour. 

Open 1 egg. Drop the white on a small saucer 
and put the yellow on top of the butter substi- 
tute. 

Open a second egg and drop the whole egg on 
top of the butter substitute. (Be sure to save 
out the white of the first egg; then if the yellow 
breaks and you cannot successfully separate 
the white and yellow, you can use that whole egg 
and have another chance at getting a perfect 
white for later use.) 

With the tips of fingers mix together the 
flour, sugar and butter. If the hands are 
washed in cold water just before doing this the 
job can be neatly and quickly done. 

Add 2 tablespoonsful of cold milk and mix 
again. 

129 



CHRISTMAS STARS 

Divide the lump of dough into two parts. 

Drop one part onto a floured board. 

With a well floured rolling pin roll out very 
thin. 

Cut in star shapes with a cookie cutter. 

With a pancake turner or a spatula lift each 
cookie into a slightly greased cookie pan. 

When one pan is full of cookies, take a small 
paint bnish or a bit of clean cotton, dip in the 
unused white of egg, and brush over the top of 
each cookie. This will make the cookies look 
glazed when they have been baked. 

Press 1,4 of a candied cherry on each cookie. 

Bake in a moderate oven till light brown. 

Remove from pan at once, being careful not 
to break. 

When the first half of the recipe is baked, 
begin on the second half — ^this makes the rolling 
and cutting easy. 

These cookies are fine to make on a Saturday 
morning some two weeks before Christmas. 
Pack the cookies in a tin box or stone jar. They 
are also very fine for sending to a friend out 
of town as they pack well (put in layers between 
oiled paper) and keep well. 

The recipe makes about six dozen if each 
cookie is rolled as thin as it should be.

SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 



COOKED SALAD DRESSING 

Put 1 quart of water into the lower part of 
a double boiler and set over the fire. 
Into the upper part of the boiler put : 
1 cupful top milk or cream, 
3 tablespoonsful sugar, 
1 teaspoonful salt, 
14 teaspoonful pepper, 
1 tablespoonful butter. 
While this is getting hot dissolve : 
3 tablespoonsful corastarch, 
1/2 teaspoonful mustard in 2 tablespoonsful 
of milk or water. Milk is best. 

Stir this into the contents of the double boiler 
and cook till thick. Stir gently while it is cook- 
ing in order to aid in smoothness. 
Measure out 1 cupful of vinegar. 
When the contents of the double boiler have 
become very thick, stir in the vinegar. Pour 
it in very slowly and stir all the time so that the 
dressing does not get lumpy. 

When the vinegar is all in, stir for 2 minutes 
longer and then let cook for 15 minutes. 

While the dressing is cooking, open 2 eggs 
135 



COOKED SALAD DRESSING 

and divide the yellows from the whites. Only 
the yellows are needed for this dressing. It is 
a good plan to make salad dressing the same 
morning as other baking is being done. Then 
you can plan to use the whites of the eggs for 
something else. 3 yellows may be used if de- 
sired and the dressing will bo still better. 

Beat the yellows till thick and creamy. 

Take out 2 tablespoonsful of the hot dressing 
and beat with the yellows. Then add 2 table- 
spoonsful more. This heats the yellows grad- 
ually so no lumps are made. 

Set the double boiler from the fire. 

Beat the eg^ and dressing into the contents 
of the double boiler. By this method of adding 
the egg, the dressing is thickened without be- 
coming *'egg-y" or lumpy. 

Pour the dressing into a jar and put in a cool 
place. 

When cool this dressing may be used plain or 
it may be mixed with whipped cream (use equal 
parts of dressing and cream measured before 
whipping) for a delicious fruit salad dressing. 

This dressing is fine for spreading on sand- 
wiches or for any salad. 



137 



FRENCH SALAD DRESSING 

Chill a mixing bowl. This may be done by 
ruiiiimj? cold water over the bowl for a few 
minutes or by putting the bowl in a cold place 
some time before it is needed for use. 
Put into the cold bowl 
y<y teaspoonful salt, 
1/4 teaspoonful paprika, 
4 tablespoonsful vegetable oil (olive oil or 
any high grade vegetable oil may be 
used), 

2 tablespoonsful white vinegar. (For a 
dainty fruit salad, lemon juice may be 
used instead of vinegar.) 
Beat the ingredients with a fork for 2 minutes 
and pour immediately over the salad. 

If the taste of onion is liked, rub the mixing 
bowl with freshly cut onion just before making 
the dressing. 

For variety try cutting a few bits of chives 
and dropping in with the dressing just before 
beating it. 

If the family is fond of salad and use a good 
139 



FRENCH SALAD DRESSING 

deal, this dressing may be made up and kept on 
hand ready for use. 

Put the ingredients into a bottle, cork tightly 
and set in a cold place. 

When ready to use, shake the bottle hard and 
pour the dressing at once over the salad. 

This dressing may be used on plain lettuce 
salad or on any fruit or vegetable salad. 



141 



STRING BEAN AND CARROT SALAD 

Take 2 cupsful cooked string beans cut in inch 
lengths, 

2 cupsful of cooked carrots diced, 

2 small green onions cut fine. 

If there are on hand a small amount of cooked 
peas, beets or other suitable vegetables these 
may be added. 

Put all together in a salad bowl. 

If vegetables have been properly seasoned in 
cooking no salt will be needed. If in doubt add 
1/2 teaspoonful salt as cold vegetables need to 
be well seasoned. 

Measure out 3 tablespoonsful vinegar, 

3 tablespoonsful vegetable oil and 
Pour both over the vegetables. 

With a fork, toss together till everj^ piece is 
shiny with oil. 

Cover tightly (the onion will make careful 
covering necessary) and set in a cold place till 
mealtime. There should be more than an hour 
for chilling. 

At mealtime, toss salad together again, gar- 
nish with a bit of lettuce around the edge of the 
bowd and serve very cold. 

143 



SLICED APPLE SALAD 

Wash 1 head of lettuce. 

Pick the leaves apart and wash again. 

Drain and wrap up in a cloth. 

Put in the ice box or in a cool place till needed. 

Scrub 2 bright red apples. 

Crack and pick over 6 English walnuts. 
(Hickory nuts or wild walnuts may be used if 
you have some.) 

Put 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice or the same 
amount of mild vinegar, 

2 tablespoonsful of vegetable oil, 
y^ teaspoonful salt, 

14 teaspoonful of paprika into a small bowl 
and mix well ; set in a cool place till ready for 
serving. 

Just before the meal is ready, core the apples 
with a corer and slice them into thin slices. Be 
sure that the red rind stays on each piece. 

Arrange the lettuce neatly on salad plates. 

Lay three slices of apple on each plate on top 
of the lettuce. 

Put 2 halves of nut on top of apple on each 
plate. 

145 



SLICED APPLE SALAD 

With a spoon mix the dressing well. 

Dip 2 teaspoonsful of dressing over each 
plateful of salad, being sure that it is well 
spread over, so that every bit of apple is sea- 
soned. 

Serve at once with crisp wafers. 

This amount will serve 6 people.

DESSERTS 



PLAIN CAKE WITH ICINa 

Put into a mixing bowl 1 egg (white and 
yellow both), 

1 cupful sugar, 

1 teaspoonful vanilla flavoring, 

l^ cupful butter substitute. 

Beat till it looks like smooth cream. The 
success of any cake largely depends on the care 
and thoroness of this beating. 

When smooth and creamy add 1 cupful milk. 

Sift together 2 cupsful flour and 4 level tea- 
spoonsful baking powder. Sift these two ingre- 
dients twice so they may be well mixed. 

Add flour and baking powder to the contents 
of the bowl. 

Beat till all lumps are goiie. 

Pour into cake pans that have been made 
ready. (This cake makes two layers or may 
be made into one large, thick cake as desired. 
To prepare cake pans, grease the pans carefully. 
Line bottoms with paper cut to fit and grease 
again. (See directions under brown bread.) 

Bake 25 minutes if made in 2 layers; 30 
minutes if baked in 1 layer. Before taking 

151 



PLAIN CAKE WITH ICING 

from the oven, tap the top of the cake with 
the finger. If the cake is done, the crust will 
spring right back into place without leaving any 
finger prints. If a finger print is left, the cake 
needs to bake longer. 

Take from the oven, run a small spatula 
around the edge of the pan; turn upside down 
over a wire cake rack, and the cake will drop 
out of the pan. 

When cool, ice with a white icing made by 
creaming together 11/2 cupsful confectioner's 
sugar, 

3 tablespoonsful butter, 

1 teaspoonful vanilla or almond flavoring, 

2 teaspoonsful cream. 

If chocolate icing is desired, add 1 square of 
melted chocolate to the above. With chocolate 
use vanilla flavoring. 

The icing should be just soft enough to spread 
easily but should not run over the sides of the 
cake. 



153 



COCOANUT PUDDING 

Put into the upper part of a double boiler 

1 quart of milk, 

2 rounded tablespoonsful of minute tap- 
ioca. 

Put at least a quart of water in the lower part 
and set over the fire. 

When milk begins to get hot stir occasionally 
so that the tapioca will thicken evenly. 

While milk and tapioca is cooking, open 2 eggs 
and divide the whites from the yellows. 

Beat the whites till stiff and put in a cool place 
till they are needed. 

Beat the yellows with i/^ cupful of sugar and 
% teaspoonful salt. 

When the milk and tapioca are smooth and 
thick stir in the yellows of egg and sugar. Pour 
gradually and stir all the time so that the yel- 
lows will not lump. 

Add 3 tablespoonsful of grated cocoanut and 
continue stirring till well mixed. 

Cook without stirring for 15 minutes till the 
pudding is like thick custard. 

Take pan from the fire and hold in the left 
hand. 

155 



COCOANUT PUDDING 

With the egg beater held in the right hand, 
beat the whites, while pouring over them the hot 
custard. Beat till the custard and whites are 
well mixed. 

Add 1 teaspoonful vanilla flavoring and beat 
till mixed. 

Set aside till cool. 

Serve cold mth cream and, if desired, sugar. 

This delicious pudding can be made early in 
the morning and kept in a cool place till time of 
serving. If desired, it may be poured into indi- 
vidual molds and served in sherbet dishes for 
a choice ''company" dessert. 



157 



BROWN BETTY PUDDING 

Crumb enough old bread to make 3 ciipsful. 

Peel and slice enough apples to make 3 cups- 
ful. 

Butter a baking dish. Use one that can be 
taken to the table, as the pudding should be 
served in the dish in which it was baked. 

Put into a dish V-j cupful of sugar, 
1 teaspoonful ground cinnamon, and mix 
together. 

Measure out 3 tablespoonsful butter and put 
in a waim place to melt. 

Put a layer of apple slices in the bottom of 
the dish. 

Shake over them a little of the sugar. 

Put a layer of crumbs next. 

Then a layer of apples on which you shake 
some sugar. 

Continue till the baking dish is full, being 
careful to have a layer of crumbs on the top. 

Pour the melted butter over the top, spreading 
it around so that all parts of the pudding are 
seasoned. 

Bake 50 minutes in moderately hot oven. 
159 



BROWN BETTY PUDDING 

Serve hot with a sauce made by creaming 
together 1 cupful light brown sugar, 

1 tablespoonful cream, 

2 tablespoonsful butter. 

A dish of this pudding, packed in a cup and 
covered with the sauce makes a fine dessert for 
a school lunch. 



161 



EHUBARB TARTS 

Sift together twice 1^2 cupsful of flour, 
14 teaspoonful salt, 
1/2 teaspoonful baking powder. 

With the tips of the fingers work in 
8 level tablespoonsful lard. 

When the mixture is smoothly mixed and looks 
like fine grains, add 3 tablespoonsful very cold 
water. Work with the tips of the fingers and 
just barely handle the dough enough to get the 
water mixed thru. 

Divide the ball of dough into 8 equal parts. 

Grease 8 tart pans or muffin rings. 

Drop one of the 8 pieces on a well floured 
bread board and roll out thin. 

Lay it in the center of one tart pan or muffin 
ring, and pinch up the sides to make a pretty 
pastry edge. 

Do the same with every other bit of dough. 
Be sure that there are no holes in the bottom of 
any of the dough shells, as that would let the 
good juice run out and would spoil your tart. 

When the 8 shells are ready, 

Peel 8 small or 4 large stalks of rhubarb. 
163 



RHUBARB TARTS 

Cut into small pieces. 

Fill each tart shell as full as it can be filled. 

Put 1 rounded tablespoonful of sugar on the 
top of the fruit in each tart. 

Shake the pans gently so that the sugar set- 
tles down upon the fruit. 

I>ake in a nioderatc^ly hot oven for 30 minutes. 
Do not let the edges get too brown. 

Remove from the pans and serve either hot 
or cold. 

These may be packed individually in paraffin 
paper for picnic use or for a school lunch. 

These directions, with merely a change of the 
fruit may be used for berry, cherry or apple 
tarts. 



165 



BAKED APPLES STUFFED WITH NUTS 

Scrub 6 fine apples. 

Remove the cores with a corer. 

Set the apples upright in a baking pan or dish. 

Fill the cores half full with light brown sugar. 
(Granlated sugar will do, but the other gives 
a fine flavor.) 

Put in 3 or 4 nut meats and fill up the rest of 
the core with sugar. 

Sprinkle over the tops 1 level teaspoonful of 
ground cinnamon, dividing it equally over the 
6 apples. 

Put 1/2 of a level teaspoonful of butter directly- 
over the stuffed core of each apple. 

Pour lyo cupsful of water in the pan. 

Bake for 50 minutes. (It is impossible to tell 
exactly how long apples should bake as the 
apples vary in size. If you use large apples 
the}'- may need an hour while a very small apple 
will bake in 35 minutes. Use a moderately hot 
oven and bake till the apple is tender to a fork- 
prick and looks deliciously bursted open. A 
moderately large apple will be just right in 50 
minutes.) 

167 



BAKED APPLES STUFFED WITH NUTS 

Serve hot with the syrup that has cooked into 
the pan. 

These apples may be drained, cooled and 
wrapped in paraffin paper. Fixed this way 
they are fine to eat cold in a school lunch or to 
take on a picnic. 



169 



ANGEL DESSERT 

Measure out 

1 cupful of cookie crumbs, 

1 cupful of thick cream, 

1 tablespoonful of powdered sugar. 

If the crumbs are a little stale spread them 
on a pie pan and set them in a warm oven till 
they are hot. Then set out to cool. 

Whip the cream till stiff. 

Beat in the powdered sugar and add 1 tea- 
spoonful of vanilla flavoring. 

Stir in the cookie crumbs and serve at once 
in tall sherbet glasses. 

This makes a quick, easy and nourishing 
dessert and also is a fine way to use up the 
cookie crumbs that are in bottom of the cookie 
jar. If you find there are no crumbs at hand, 
crumble up 4 macaroons in place of the cookie 
crumbs and make the same way. 

The addition of chopped nuts or chopped 
raisins or cherries makes a pleasant change. 



171 



FRUIT MARSHMALLOW WHIP 

Materials : 1 box of fresh marshmallows, 
1/2 cupful of finiit juice (orange or grape 

juice is the best), 
1 cupful of hea\'y cream. 
1 tablespoonful of powdered sugar. 

Cut the marshmallows into small pieces, and 
put them into a bowl. 

Pour the fruit juice over the marshmallows 
and set in a cool place for 2 hours. During this 
time the marshmallows will soak up all the fruit 
juice and will become soft and luscious. 

Then whip the cream till stiff. 

Add the sugar and the soaked marshmallows. 

Serve at once in small glasses or tall sherbet 
glasses. 

Add a candied cherry or nut meat to the top 
of each glass as a garnish if desired. 

This will serve 8 ; divide or increase the recipe 
if fewer or more are to be served. 

This makes a very delicious company or party 
dessert.

SANDWICHES 



CHEESE DREAMS 

Cut 8 slices of bread. (Large sized loaf.) 

Butter four slices. 

Grate cream cheese over the other 4 slices. 
(If it is not convenient to grate the cheese cut 
it into very thin slices and arrange it neatly on 
the bread.) 

Press the buttered slices, butter side down, 
onto the cheese-covered slices. 

Lay the four large sandwiches thus made on 
a pan and put in rather hot oven till brown. 
These may be toasted on an electric or any 
other kind of toaster provided the sandwiches 
can lie flat while toasting. If they are tilted 
the cheese will run out while cooking. 

Cut each sandwich in two diagonally and serve 
at once. 

These sandwiches will take the place of meat 
at luncheon or Sunday evening tea. 

When used at a picnic, they can be made, 
ready for the toasting, at home and then toasted 
in a wire toaster over an open fire. Very 
delicious. 

181 



VALENTINE SANDWICHES 

With a shai-p knife cut a loaf of bread that is 
more than one day old into thin slices. 

Boil 2 eggs for 15 minutes. (These may be 
boiling while bread is being cut.) 

Cool in running water, peel and divide yellows 
from whites. 

Chop whites fine. (May be put thru a 
grinder.) 

Mix yellows with 14 teaspoonful salt, Y^ tea- 
spoonful mustard, 1 teaspoonful vegetable oil 
and 1 teaspoonful vinegar. 

Beat till creamy. 

With a heart-shaped cookie cutter cut the 
slices of bread into heart-shaped slices. 

Spread the center of each piece of bread with 
yellow mixture. 

Sprinkle chopped white around the edge and 
press firmly on bread. 

Dot center of the yellow part with 2 tiny bits 
of red pimento. 

Serve on napkin covered plate with sand- 
wiches of plain bread and jam cut in oblong 
shape. 

1S3 



VALENTINE SANDWICHES 

It will be noticed that this is an uncovered 
sandwich and is unusually pretty and ''party" 
like. It is very nourishing too, and when served 
with hot cocoa and heart-shaped cookies, it 
makes a nice feature for a Valentine party. 



185 



SANDWICHES FOR AN EASTER PARTY 

With a very sharp knife cut a loaf of bread 
that is more than a day old into thin slices. 

With a rabbit-shaped cookie cutter cut each 
slice into rabbit shape. Use the scraps of bread 
for meat loaf, bread pudding, bread muffins, or 
scalloped com or fish — not a scrap should be 
wasted. 

Make a paste of the yellows of 2 hard boiled 
eggs and 4 teaspoonsful of boiled salad dressing. 

Spread the paste very thin on the rabbit- 
shaped slices of bread. Put in 2 tiny colored 
candies (green or brown) for the eyes. 

Serve with sandwiches made of plain bread 
and butter cut in triangles, and ham sandwiches 
cut oblong. 

The rabbit sandwiches, being uncovered, are 
very pretty when thus served with plain sand- 
wiches. 



187 



HAM SANDWICHES 

I*iit thni the meat grinder enough ham to 
make 1/2 cupful. This may be scrapn of hain or 
may ])e fresh boiled ham cut in thin slic(!s })efore 
grinding. 

Put thru the grinder the second time, adding 
the whites of 2 hard boiled eggs or two whole 
hard boiled eggs and grinding all together. 

Mix with 4 teaspoonsful of boiled salad dress- 
ing and spread on tliin slices of brend. 

Press cover slice in place and cut in two ob- 
long sandwiches. 



189 



EAISIN SANDWICH FILLING 

Grate the rind and squeeze out the juice of 1 
lemon. 

Put 1 cup of water, 
% cup of sug-ar, 
with the lemon juice and grated rind and bring 
to a boil. 

While this is getting hot put 1 cupful of 
seeded raisins thru a grinder. 

Dissolve 2 level tablespoonsful of cornstarch 
in 2 tablespoonsful of water. 

When juice, sugar and water has boiled 2 
minutes, add the dissolved cornstarch and cook 
slowly 6 minutes. 

Add ground raisins, stirring all the while. 

As soon as the mixture begins to boil, after 
the raisins have been added, set the pan from 
the fire and let stand 10 minutes. 

Then pour into a bowl or jar and set in a cool 
place. This filling will keep for several days. 

191 



RAISIN SANDWICH FILLING 

To make sandwiches: Spread one piece of 
thin bread with butter and another with the 
raisin mixture. Press together and cut in two 
parts, diagonally. Serve at once or wrap in 
paraffin paper till needed. 

Or : cut one half the bread with round cookie 
cutter and one half "with doughnut cutter of the 
same size. Put raisin filling on cookie part. 
Butter doughnut shape and press down on other 
part. Drop a bit of bright red jelly in the hole. 



193 



JAMS AND CONSERVES 



STRAWBERRY JAM 

Pick over 1 quart of strawberries. 

Wash carefully, being careful not to break 
or mash the tender fruit. 

Measure and pour into a saucepan. 

Add an equal amount of sugar. 

Shake the pan till every berry is covered with 
sugar. They should be still damp from the 
washing and the sugar will easily stick to the 
fruit. 

Set over a very low fire and, without stirring, 
let the sugar melt. 

In a few minutes there will be plenty of juice 
drawn from the berries by the melting sugar. 

Increase the heat till fruit begins to boil. 

Let boil briskly exactly 8 minutes. Twice 
during this time stir very gently so that no fruit 
or sugar sticks to the bottom of the saucepan. 

Take up at once into jelly glasses, and when 
cool cover with melted paraflfin. 



197 



RASPBERRY JAM, (both red and black) 
GOOSEBERRY JAM 
CURRANT JAM 
BLACKBERRY JAM 

All these fruits may be made into delicious 
jam by the same recipe given for Strawberry 
Jam. In each case bo careful to add the susfar 
while berries are still damp from the washing, 
and avoid stirring as this will break the ber- 
ries. Stir only twice and that while boiling is 
going on. 

All of these fruits, including strawberries, 
when made by the above recipe, are delicious for 
making ice cream sundaes. 



199 



1, 2, 3, 4, JAM 

Take 1 pineapple (or 1 can of grated pine- 
apple), 

2 lemons, 

3 oranges, 

4 apples. 

Peel the pineapple, core and take out eyes. 

If the orange is a kind that has much ''white" 
to the rind, peel off half the rind. 

Cut the orange and lemon into 8 pieces each. 

Peel, quarter and core the apples. 

Put all fruit thru a coarse grinder. 

Mix fruit and any juice that has escaped, and 
measure. 

Take an equal amount of granulated sugar 
and mix thoroly with the fruit. 

Put over a very slow fire till mixture boils. 

Boil 20 minutes. 

Pour into jelly glasses. 

This recipe should make about 15 glasses. If 
small apples are used take 8 instead of 4. This 
is a fine jam to make in the springtime when 
the jam shelf begins to look bare. It makes 
very fine picnic sandwiches. 

201 



PEAR HONEY 

Peel eight large *' winter" pears. These are 
hard, green and brown pears that come late in 
the year and that are inferior for eating. 

Cut in quarters, remove cores and put thru 
a coarse grinder. Be sure to catch all the juice 
that may run from the grinder while the pears 
are being ground. 

Mix pear and juice, and measure. 

Measure out an equal amount of sugar. 

Mix together well and put over a slow fire. 

After it comes to a boil increase the heat till 
it bubbles briskly. 

Cook for 20 minutes, stirring frequently so 
that it does not scorch. 

Pour into small glasses or jars and, when 
cool, cover with melted paraffin the same as for 
jelly. 



203 



PEACH JAM 

Peel and remove stones from 12 peaches. 

Put into saucepan and, with a big spoon or 
wire potato masher, break peaches into small 
bits. This work must be done quickly so that 
peaches will not turn brown. 

Measure the pulp. 

Add an equal amount of sugar and mix well. 

Put over a slow fire till it comes to a boil. 

Then slightly increase the heat and cook 15 
minutes. 

Pour into small jars or glasses and seal with 
paraffin. 



205 



RHUBARB CONSERVE 

Wash, peel and cut up into 1 inch pieces 
enough rhubarb to make 1 quart. 

Put in a saucepan and add : 
3 cupsful of sugar, 
1 lemon cut into tiny slices. 

Toss together till well mixed and then 

Put over a slow fire till sugar melts and draws 
juice from fruit. 

When there is plenty of juice in pan, increase 
the heat and cook till mixture has boiled 10 
minutes. 

Add 1 cupful of seeded raisins. 

Stir in well and cook for 10 minutes more. 

Pour into small jars and use while fresh. 

This is very nice in the springtime when 
rhubarb is plenty. The early summer rhubarb, 
which is a little strong, may also be used this 
way. 



207 



VICTORY JAM 

Soak 1 pound dried peaches for 1 hour. 

Wash carefully in 3 changes of water. (The 
soaking loosens dirt and grit and is very im- 
portant. ) 

Pour over the peaches 1 quart of freshly 
boiled water, cover and let soak for 24 hours. 

The skins will easily rub off by that time and 
it is best to remove them — especially if they are 
furry. 

Put on to boil over a low fire. There should 
be enough water to cook, tho most of the quart 
will have soaked into the fruit. 

Cover tightly while cooking and simmer for 
1 hour. 

Mash well with potato masher ; a wire masher 
is best. 

Add y2 cup sugar, 
V2 cup corn syrup, 
2 teaspoonsful ground cinnamon, 
1 lemon shaved into tiny slices, 
1 cup seeded raisins and stir in with fruit. 

Simmer gently for y^ hour. 

Put into small jars. 

This is very fine to serve with hot biscuits. 
209 



APPLE HONEY 

Save the peelings and perfect cores from 
twelve apples. Perfect cores are cores without 
worms. 

Wash and put on to cook with 1 pint of water. 

Cover and cook slowly till the water is about 
half boiled away. This will take at least 25 
minutes and may take longer. 

Strain thru a fine sieve. Press gently with 
a broad spoon to press out all the juice. 

Measure the juice ; there should be more than 
a cupful. 

Put the juice into a saucepan and add % as 
much sugar as you have juice. 

Stir till sugar is dissolved. 

Put over the fire and cook till juice drips like 
thick syrup when dropped from a spoon. 

Pour at once into jelly glasses. 

This is delicious with hot biscuits, for sand- 
wiches or to eat on bread between meals. It 
costs nothing but the sugar. 



211 



OLD FASHIONED APPLE SAUCE 

Peel, quarter and care 8 medium sized apples. 
The tart cooking apples are the kind to use for 
this sauce. 

Wash and put in a saucepan. 

Pour water over them; pour slowly and use 
just enough so that you can see the water be- 
tween the apples at the side of the pan ; not quite 
enough to cover the apples with water. This 
will take about 3 cupsful. 

Cover well and cook slowly for 15 minutes. 

Remove from the fire and test with a fork. 
If the apples are cooked enough they will be 
veiy tender when pricked. Cook till tender, 
testing as needed. 

When tender mash with a potato masher or 
large spoon till apple quarters are well broken 
up. 

Stir in 2 cupsful of sugar and set back on 
fire. 

Cook 10 minutes. 

Remove from fire, take up a little of the sauce 
into a dish and test for sweetness. Apples vary 
so much that it is impossible to tell exactly how 

213 



OLD FASHIONED APPLE SAUCE 

much sugar is needed. If too tart add V2 cup- 
ful of sugar and cook 3 minutes. 

Serve when cool. 

This is a tasty and wholesome dish for either 
breakfast or luncheon. 



215 



GOOD THINGS TO DRINK 



HOT COCOA 

Put 1 rounded teaspoonful of cocoa, 
2 rounded teaspoonsful of sugar and 
% cup of cold water into a saucepan over 
the fire. 

Boil three minutes (count time after boiling 
begins). 

Add l^/o cupfuls of milk. 

Cook till milk forms a skin on the top. Do 
not boil. 

Pour into 2 cups and, while very hot, drop a 
marshmallow into each cup. 

This is very easy to make and is very refresh- 
ing and nourishing. Try it some time when 
you come home from school tired and hungry. 

If more than 2 cups are desired multiply the 
recipe to make the desired amount. 



21§ 



ICED COCOA 

Make a rich symp by boiling together for 5 
minutes 

4 teaspoonsful cocoa, 
8 teaspoonsful sugar, 
1 cupful of water. 
Put in a bottle with a well fitted top. 
When ready to use add 1 tablespoonful of 
the syrup to each glassful of cold milk. Stir 
well and serve. 

The syrup may be made in a larger quantity, 
say two or three times this recipe, and may be 
put away in a cool place for future use. 

Iced cocoa is both refreshing and nourishing 
and is an ideal summer drink. 



221 



GRAPE JUICE PUNCH 

Roll 1 lemon till soft. 

Cut in half crosswise and squeeze out juice 
with a lemon squeezer. 

Put juice in a pitcher and add 1 tablespoonful

CONFECTIONS 



STUFFED PRUNES 

Put 1 pound of prunes in a pan and cover 
with water. 

Let stand Y2 hour. 

Wash in three changes of water. (The 
standing in water will loosen the dirt and will 
make the prunes very clean and free from dirt.) 

Put back in the pan, and pour over the prunes 
1 quart of fresh water. 

Cover and let stand 24 hours. During this 
long time the prunes will soak up practically all 
of the water. 

Remove from the pan and drain. There 
should be no water left but in case a little does 
remain, it may be used in a pudding sauce. 

When the prunes are drained, remove the 
seeds. This is careful work and should be done 
very neatly. Slit each prune down the long 
side, poke out the seed, tuck the cut edges in 
neatly and pinch the prune into shape. If de- 
sired a nut meat may be inserted in the place of 
the seed. 

As each prune is seeded and tucked into 
shape, lay it on a plate or piece of paraffin 
paper. 

237 



STUFFED PRUNES 

When all the prunes are prepared in this way, 
fill a sauce dish with granulated sugar and roll 
the prunes, one at a time, in the sugar. 

Arrange on a bonbon dish or pack in neat 
rows in a tin box for future use. 

Notice that these prunes are not cooked; the 
long soaking makes them plump and sweet and 
they taste fresh and delicious. They make a 
fine addition to a plate of mixed candies or they 
may be served in place of dessert after dinner. 
They are very wholesome.

CANDY BALLS 

A best-of-all Christmas candy that is good any 
time of year 

Measure out 1 cupful of dates, seeded, 
1 cupful of figs, 

1 cupful of prunes (cooked and seeded), 
1 cupful of nuts, any kind. 

Put all thru a meat grinder using the medium 
sized cutter. 

Take the juice and grated rind of 1 orange. 

Mix all together into a smooth paste. 

Roll the paste into small, even-sized balls 
about the size of a marble. 

Put 1/4 cupful of granulated sugar on a plate. 

Toss the balls, 4 at a time, in the sugar till 
they are well covered. 

Lay in neat rows on paraffin paper or a large 
plate for at least 1 hour to dry. 

These balls may be packed for mailing in a 
tin box and are a good Christmas gift. Or a 
dozen and a half of the balls arranged with a 
dozen Christmas Star cookies on a holly 
trimmed plate make a nice gift for a favorite 
neighbor.

PUFFED RICE BALLS 

Measure out 4 cupsful of puffed rice. 

Spread this out on a shallow pan and set it 
in a warm oven till the rice is crisp and hot. 
The oven should be only moderately hot and the 
crisping will take about 10 minutes. 

While the rice is in the oven, cook together 
114 cupsful of sugar and 
1/2 cupful of water. 

Cook about 8 minutes. 

Test by dripping from a spoon. When the 
syrup drops in a long hair-like thread it is done. 

Remove from the fire. 

Toss the rice into the pan with the syrup and 
tumble together with a fork. 

When every bit of rice is covered with sugar, 
grease the hands with a bit of butter, as for 
pulling taffy, and form the rice into balls. This 
amount will make 8 or 10 according to the size 
chosen. 

Put on a buttered plate to harden. 
243 



PUFFED RICE BALLS 

These balls may be eaten at once or they may 
be wrapped in paraffin paper and put in a lunch 
or served at a school or home party. 

Popcorn balls may be made the same way 
using freshly popped com instead of puffed 
rice.
