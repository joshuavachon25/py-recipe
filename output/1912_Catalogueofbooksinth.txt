CATALOGUE OF REFERENCE BOOKS 



Note. — The large majority of the books in this catalogue are suitable for the teacher

cannot be effective; but, in making selections for the library, the necessities of the pupils 
should be provided for first. 

When in doubt as to the character of any of the books recommended, School Boards 
and Teachers should communicate ivith the publisher or his Canadian Agent. In some 
cases, publishers are willing to send books on approbation, and in all cases they are 
willing to supply full particulars. 

The prices given within are not guaranteed: they are sometimes net, sometimes sub- 
ject to discount, and occasionally only approximate. 

The more important books in each list are asterisked or otherwise indicated.
