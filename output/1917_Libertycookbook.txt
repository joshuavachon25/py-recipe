LIBERTY BREADS TO SAVE WHEAT 
Tested Recipes Enabling Cut in Use of Wiiite Flour 

OTHER CEREALS ARE USED 

Cornmeal, Oatmeal and Barley found to be good 
substitutes in making excellent breads 

The world needs wheat. It is depending on the 
United States and Canada for its supply. Amer- 
ica must divide what she has with the other na- 
tions. To enable her to save sufficient wheat, ex- 
perts have perfected Liberty breads, each loaf of 
which saves from 20 to 35 per cent of the amount 
of wheat flour usually used. Here are the pro- 
portions for one loaf of a cornmeal yeast bread: 

IV4. cups milk and water, or water 
2 tablespoons sugar 

1 tablespoon fat 

2 teaspoons salt 
% cup cornmeal 

2ys cups flour 
Vz cake compressed yeast 
% cup warm water. 

Add sugar, fat and salt to liquid and bring to 
boiling point. Add cornmeal slowly, stirring con- 
stantly until all is added. Remove from fire, cool 
mixture, and add compressed yeast, softened in 
1/4 cup warm water. Add flour and knead. Let 
rise until about double its bulk, knead again and 
put in pan. when light, bake in moderate oven 
for at least an hour. If the cornmeal is well 
cooked, more liquid will be needed, about V2 cup. 

OATMEAL A GOOD SUBSTITUTE 

Next to corn in popularity have come oats. 
There is a new oatmeal yeast bread, not unlike 
graham bread in appearance, having a sweet nutty 
flavor much favored by those who like dark 
breads. This is the recipe: 

1 cup milk and water, or water 
1 teaspoon salt 
1 tablespoon fat 

5 



2 tablespoons sugar 
1 cup rolled oats 
IVi cups wheat flour 
1/^ cake compressed yeast 
V'i. cup warm water. 
Scald liquid and pour it over the rolled oats, 
sugar, salt and fat. Let stand about half hour, 
until lukewarm. Add yeast, softened in the warm 
water. Add flour and knead. Let rise until double 
in bulk. Knead again and place in pan. When 
light, bake in a moderate oven from 45 to 90 min- 
utes. The oatmeal is better ground into finer pieces 
by running through a meat chopper. 

BARLEY YEAST BREAD 

Barley flour as an adult human food has been 
little known, although it has all the properties to 
recommend it to the family larder. Barley yeast 
bread is new and good and made by using: 
1 cup milk and water 
1 tablespoon sugar 
1 tablespoon fat 
1 teaspoon salt 
Vz cake compressed yeast 
1 % cups barley flour 
2% cups wheat flour. 

Soften the yeast in part of the liquid. Combine 
ingredients. Mix into a dough Knead and let 
rise to double original bulk. Knead again and put 
in pan. When once more doubled in bulk, bake 
about 45 minutes. 

RYE BREAD 

Rye, also generally grown, is less pleasing, to 
the majority of people, in breads, but here is a rye 
yeast bread for variety: 

1 cup milk and water 

2 tablespoons sugar 
1 tablespoon fat 

1 teaspoon salt 

Vi cake compressed yeast, softened in 2 table- 
spoons water 

6 



2^ cups rye flour 

2^ cups wheat flour 

Combine ingredients. Mix into dough and knead. 
Let rise until double original bulk. Knead again, 
when again double in bulk, bake 45 minutes. 

POTATO BREAD 

The modern conservationist makes three loaves 
of potato yeast bread in this fashion: 
j Vi cup milk and water 
j 4 tablespoons sugar 
i 4 tablespoons fat 
[ IVz teaspoons salt 

( Vz cake compressed yeast, softened in ^/4 cup 
• water 

4 cups boiled potatoes 
[ 8 cups flour 

^' Combine ingredients. Mix into dough with about 
6 cups of the flour and knead. Let rise until 
double original bulk. Knead and add remainder of 
flour. When again double in bulk, bake about 1 
lour. 

RICE ANOTHER SUBSTITUTE 
This recipe for the rice yeast bread produces two 
oaves. The rice should be boiled in a large quan- 
;ity of water — some eight or ten times as much 
vater as rice. This gives a dry rice, which is an 
mportant factor in the making of the bread after 
he following directions: 
1 cup milk 
6 tablespoons sugar 
4 tablespoons fat 
Vk teaspoons salt 
% cake compressed yeast, softened in Va. cup 

liquid 
3 cups boiled rice 
8 cups flour. 
Scald the milk with sugar, salt and fat. Let cool 
sjitil lukewarm and pour over boiled rice. Add 
bftened yeast. Stir in flour and knead. Let rise 
mtil double its bulk. Knead again and put into 

7 



pans. Let rise until light and bake 50 minutes to 
1 hour in moderate oven.

onion, cauliflower, cabbage, and any cooked cereal 
or macaroni may be used to add to the nutritive 
value and flavor of soup.

SUGGESTIONS FOR MENUS 

The housekeeper should know how to substitute 
for wheat and meat new and unusual foods, and 
yet have palatable, nourishing, well balanced 
meals. The three groups of food, suggested be- 
low, building, fuel, and regulating foods, should 
be included in the meals for each day. 

A — Building Foods: 
1. Proteins: 

Milk and eggs for children. 
Meat or its substitutes, as milk, cheese, 
beans, peas, lentils, nuts, at least 
once a day, for adults. 



-Fuel Foods: 

1. Fats in some form at every meal: 

a. A choice of butter, oleomargarine, 

Ggg yolk; olive or cottonseed 
(salad) oil; crisco, or vegetole; 
meat fats, as lard and drippings; or 
the mixtures, as califene, cottolene, 
or compound lard. 

b. Nuts, olives, and soy beans. 

2. Starches, two or three times a day: 

In place of wheat starch use: 

a. For breakfast, cereals, rolled oats or 

oatmeal, cornmeal, cornflakes, pop- 
corn or puffed corn; rice, riceflakes 
or puffed rice; barley meal. 

b. For vegetables, instead of macaroni 
products, brown or white rice, hom- 
iny, cornmeal or potatoes. 

c. For bread, corn breads, or instead of 

part of patent flour, use graham 
flour, rice flour, cornmeal or corn 
flour, oatmeal, rolled oats, rye flour, 
barley flour, soy bean flour, or cot- 
tonseed flour. 

3. Sugars two or three times a day: 

22 



White or brown sugar or their substi- 
tutes, such as honey, molasses, fruit 
and corn syrup; sweet fresh fruit, or 
dried fruit, as figs, raisins, dates, 
prunes. 

C — Regulating Foods: 

1. Cellulose, once or twice a day: 

A choice between celery, radishes, root 
vegetables, greens, salad plants, cab- 
bage, bran of grains, including whole 
grain products, such as rolled oats, 
cracked wheat, brown rice, graham 
flour and the skins of fruit and vege- 
tables. 

2. Mineral matter at least once a day: 

Fruit and vegetables. 



The housekeeper should conserve left-overs. 

Vegetables — Use in soups, salads, or to flavor meat 
substitutes. 

Bread — Steam, reheat, toast (plain, milk, French, 
cubes, or strips for soups, sandwiches) ; grate 
crumbs to be used with meats, vegetables, fruit, 
eggs, milk; dry in a slow oven and put through 
the meat grinder, these crumbs may be used 
to thicken sauces, coat croquettes, or to cover 
a dish to be baked. 

Meats — Slice or cube and reheat in sauce; grind 
all of the trimmings to use in soups and sauces 
or to flavor cornmeal mush (Scrapple) ; com- 
bine in omelettes, souffles, croquettes and scal- 
loped dishes. 

Fats — Save all drippings; render all fat from meat 
and use mixed or singly in cooking. 

Fruits — Cook all small portions into sauce or jam, 
or combine several varieties to make a con- 
serve. Use fruit to flavor soups, sauces and 
desserts.

TO RENDER FAT 

Scrape and wipe the raw fat with a clean, damp 
cloth ; then cut into small pieces — the smaller the i 
pieces the more fat extracted. To every pound of 
suet or soft fat allow i^ pint hot water. Place in 
a kettle over a moderate fire or in a moderates 
oven, and cook until the water has evaporated and i 
the fat is free from bubbling and is clear. Slight 
ly cool, skim; strain through a piece of clean] 
cheesecloth or a fine sieve into a crock or tin ves- 
sel. Be careful not to over-cook. Use the crack- : 
lings with cornmeal as a shortener. 

TO CLARIFY FAT 

A good housekeeper will not waste fat. Save all 
the skimmings from soup, trimmings from steak,; 
drippings, etc. Put fat into pan. Set over mod-( 
erate fire until fat is melted, then strain through ij 
fine strainer into clean pan. 

To two cups of melted fat, allow 1 cup of boilinffi 
water and % teaspoon baking soda.

Cook slowly until water has evaporated and fat 
is clear. Skim and strain into permanent can. 
While cooling, beat. Or, thin slices of raw potato 
may be cooked with the fat. When the potato is 
brown, remove and strain fat. 

MUTTON OR LAMB FAT FOR FRYING 
OR SHORTENING 

1 pound fat, cleaned and cut into small pieces 

2 teaspoons baking soda 
1 quart cold water. 

Cover the fat with the water and soda, and al- 
low it to remain in the water for an hour; then 
drain well. Put into a kettle; add 1 cup cold water, 
and render on the back of the stove or in a mod- 
erate oven until free from water. Strain through 
a fine strainer or two thicknesses of cheesecloth. 
Measure, and when partially cool, beat into the 
rendered fat an equal amount of cottonseed oil 
and a little salt, 1 teaspoon of salt to one pint 
of the fat. Beat until the fat is very white and 
soft. 

BEEF FAT WITH COTTONSEED OIL 

To 2 cups of the rendered fat, slightly cooled, 
allow 2 cups of cottonseed oil, i/^ teaspoon salt. 
Beat until stiff and smooth and white. This mix- 
ture becomes aerated and is very much like crisco. 
Good for biscuit, spiced cakes, bread, frying or 
seasoning or where other fats are used. 

SALAD OILS 

Cottonseed and olive oil are vegetable oils and 
are good for salad dressings or for frying foods, 
as they disintigrate at a very high temperature. 

BUTTER SUBSTITUTE 

To V2 pound of butter or oleomargarine allow i/^ 
pound of sweet milk, slightly heated, i/^ teaspoon 
salt, and saltspoon butter coloring. Beat with an 
egg whip in a bowl or in a small churn until every 
drop of the milk has been mixed thoroughly with 
the butter or oleomargarine.

This is good to serve with bread or for season- 
ing, but will not do for frying, as the fat contains 
too much moisture. 

The fats obtained from the preparation and 
cooking of the following kinds of meat can be 
used to good advantage to season other food prep- 
arations. 

Skimmings from soups or beef stews and the 
drippings from the steak or roast should be put 
into a kettle and clarified, then kept by itself. Ex- 
cellent for seasoning carrots, beets and for fry- 
ing white potatoes, etc. 

Ham and bacon fats should be kept in pots by 
themselves, and are good for seasoning parsnips, 
cabbage, sweet potatoes, eggs, etc. 

Lamb and mutton fat may be mixed together 
and used for seasoning bean purees or lima beans i 
or other beans. 

Chicken fat, rendered, makes fine pie crust, or t 
may be used in cake or mixed with olive or cot-' 
tonseed oil in a salad dressing, and is good to use 
for seasoning cauliflower, asparagus or for fry- 
ing oysters or clams. 

Do not waste a particle of fat. Render, clarify,' 
and if rancid, use tor soap making. Five pounds; 
of clean grease will make 8i/^ pounds of good soap.) 
Follow rules on Babbit's lye can. 

SOAPS 

SOAP— I. 

5 pounds clarified fat 
iy2 quarts cold water 

1 can best lye 
iy2 teaspoons borax 
1/^ cup ammonia. 

SOAP— II, 
51/^ pounds clarified fat 
31/^ pints cold water 
1 can lye. 

26 



TOILET SOAP— III. 

1 pound cottonseed oil 
% pound white lard 
10 tablespoons lye 
1% cups cold water 

5 drops lavender or oil of geranium or oil of 
sassafras. 

Do not use tin or aluminum vessels in making 
soaps. 

PREPARATION OF FAT— I. 

Fresh fat or oil may be used for soap making, 
but fat left from cooking is equally as good. Cook- 
ing fat should be clarified by boiling with raw po- 
tato and strained through cheesecloth. For toilet 
soaps, fresh fat or oils can be used. 

MIXING OF SOAP— II. 

Dissolve lye in cold water. The action of the 
lye will heat the mixture, which must be set aside 
to cool. Lye mixture should be stirred with a 
stick. Steam from the lye irritates the skin, 
hence it is better to protect the hands by putting 
paper bags over them while stirring. 

If borax and ammonia are used, add them to 
lye mixture before adding fat. Perfume is added 
just as soap thickens. 

All soap mixtures should stand until consistency 
of honey, then be moulded. 

MOULDING OF SOAP— III. 

A small quantity may be moulded in an agate 
pan; the pan should be wet before the mixture 
is poured into it. Larger quantities may be poured 
into boxes. Line box with several thicknesses of 
yellow paper, greasing top layer on side next to 
soap. 

All soap should stand in moderately warm tem- 
perature until hard, then cut into cakes. Use 
agate or wooden utensils, as lye eats tin.
