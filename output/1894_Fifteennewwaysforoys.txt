CURRIED OYSTERS 

Drain twenty-five good, fat oysters, 
boil the liquor, skim and strain it. 
Into a saucepan put one tablespoonful 
of butter, slice into it one good-sized 
onion ; stir and cook until the onion is 
a golden brown. Then add a level 
tablespoonful of flour, mix and add the 
oyster liquor, which should measure 
one-half pint. If it does not, add 
sufficient chicken stock to make the 
quantity ; stir until boiling ; mix a 
teaspoonful of curry powder with a 
little stock, a teaspoonful of turmeric, 
moistened with a little starch, and boil 
again ; add one-half teaspoonful of salt 
and strain into the upper part of a

double boiler. Have ready now a 
griddle, quite hot. Brush it lightly 
with butter, throw on four or five of 
the oysters ; as soon as they sear or 
bown, turn them, brown, and throw 
them into the curry sauce. So con- 
tinue until you have the whole num- 
ber cooked. Serve at once. 



SAUTED OYSTERS 

Drain twenty-five fat oysters, spread 
them out on a board, carefully lifting 
them with the fingers by the muscular 
part. Never stick a fork into an 
oyster. With a soft piece of cheese 
cloth, dry each one carefully without 
bruising. Dust lightly with salt and 



FOR Oysters 

red pepper. Have ready a large sheet- 
iron sauted pan. Put in the bottom 
just sufficient butter to keep the oyster 
from sticking. Have at your side 
the serving dish, nicely heated, in 
which you may put a tablespoonful of 
butter, and if you use wine, a table- 
spoonful of sherry, and about four 
drops of Worcestershire sauce. Now 
throw the oysters, a few at a time, into 
the hot pan. Shake them. Lift them 
quickly as soon as the gills have 
curled ; put them into the serving dish 
and then cook a second lot. Do not 
cook over eight at a time. Serve at 
once.

BOILED OYSTERS 

Melt two tablepoonsfuls of butter 
and then strain or pour it off care- 
fully, leaving the sediment in the 
melting pan. Put the strained butter 
in a heated dish in which you are 
going to serve the oysters. Have 
ready a good-sized kettle of boiling 
water. Have the oysters drained 
in a bowl, which hold close to 
the kettle in your left hand. Now 
with a skimmer take out five or six 
oysters. Throw them into the boiling 
water for just a minute. Then with 
the same skimmer take them out, drain 
carefully, throw them into the heated 
dish of melted butter, and so continue 
until you have the desired quantity

boiled. Add then to each twenty-five 
a half-teaspoonful of salt and just a 
grain of cayenne. Serve smoking hot. 
This is one of the most delicious ways 
of cooking oysters. If you use wine, 
two tablespoonfuls of sherry may be 
added. 



OYSTERS A LA NEWBURG 

Drain fifty oysters ; pour over them 
a pitcher of cold water. Have ready 
a granite pan, smoking hot ; throw in 
the oysters ; add two ounces of butter, 
a teaspoonful of salt and a quarter of 
a teaspoonful of pepper. Stir carefully 
with a wooden spoon until the oysters 
are smoking hot. Have ready the 

13

yolks of two eggs beaten with six table- 
spoonfuls of cream ; add quickly — 
do not boil ; then add a tablespoonful 
of sherry and serve on nicely browned 
toast. 



KEEBOBBED OYSTERS 

Drain fifty oysters. Boil the liquor, 
skim and strain, and stand aside until 
wanted. Take the white part from 
one root of celery, and slice it very 
fine. Chop sufficient parsley to make 
two tablespoonfuls. Put out on the 
board about a pint of stale bread 
crumbs ; beat four eggs ; add to them 
about four tablespoonfuls of oyster 
liquor. Now dip each oyster first in 

14

the egg and then into the crumbs. 
Arrange them neatly over the bottom 
of a baking dish, crowding them just 
a little ; sprinkle over them salt, pep- 
per, celery and parsley ; then dip 
again and put over another layer of 
oysters ; season, add celery and pars- 
ley, and so continue until the baking 
dish is full ; having the last layer oys- 
ters. Cut a tablespoonful of butter 
into pieces, and put them over the 
J;op ; pour a gill of the oyster liquor 
over the whole. Bake in quick oven 
twenty minutes. Serve smoking hot.

PAN BAKED 

Drain twenty-five oysters free from 
all liquor. The oysters should be 
good-sized and fat. In the bottom of 
an individual baking dish put one 
square of nicely toasted bread. On 
top of this arrange about six oysters ; 
sprinkle over them a quarter teaspoon- 
ful of salt and a dash of pepper, and 
then pour over four tablespoonfuls 
of cream. Stand these dishes in a bak- 
ing pan, then run into a hot oven for 
about ten minutes. Serve at once in 
the dishes in which they were cooked.

OYSTER TARTS 

Have ready about half-pound of 
French puff paste. Drain fifty oysters. 
Put ten into • individual baking 
dishes. Dust over about a quarter 
teaspoonful of salt, a grain of red 
pepper, and place in the center a bit of 
butter the size of a hickory nut. Roll 
the paste into a thin sheet ; with a 
round cutter stamp out a top. Place 
this top over the oysters, brush it 
lightly with the yolk of an egg, and 
bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. 
Serve in the dishes in which they were 
baked. These, if carefully made, are 
sightly and are certainly very good.

CREAMED OYSTERS 

Drain fifty oysters ; pour over 
them a pitcher of cold water. Then 
turn them into a saucepan ; bring 
them to a boiling point, drain again, 
this time saving the liquor. Measure 
it, and add to it sufficient milk to 
make one pint. Put two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter and two of flour into a 
saucepan ; mix over the fire without 
browning; then add the oyster liquor 
and milk ; stir constantly until boil- 
ing ; add the oysters, and bring just 
to boiling point. Take from the fire, 
add a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter 
of a teaspoonful of pepper, and if you 
use wine, two tablespoonfuls of sherry. 
Serve at once. 



FOR Oysters 

SPINDLED OYSTERS 

Drain twenty-five large oysters. 
Cut breakfast bacon into very thin 
slices, and then cut each slice into 
three pieces. Take an ordinary broil- 
ing skewer ; run it through the hard 
part of an oyster and then back so as 
to pin each oyster between two pieces 
of bacon ; that is, run the skewer 
through a piece of bacon as though 
you were sticking it with a pin, then 
through an oyster, and then through 
another piece of bacon, and so on 
until the skewer is filled. Arrange all 
the skewers neatly on a double broiler ; 
broil quickly over a clear fire, first on 
one side then on the other. Serve at 
once on the skewers.

SCALLOP OF OYSTER AND 
MACARONI 

Break four ounces of macaroni into 
pieces two inches long ; throw into 
boiling water ; boil rapidly thirty- 
minutes ; drain ; throw into cold 
water for fifteen minutes ; drain again. 
Drain fifty oysters. Put a layer of 
these oysters into the bottom of a 
baking dish, then a layer of the boiled 
macaroni ; another layer of oysters 
and macaroni ; dusting a little salt 
and pepper over each layer ; continue 
until the dish is filled ; having the last 
layer macaroni. Cut a tablespoonful 
of butter into bits. Put the bits over 
the top, and dust thickly with bread 
crumbs. Pour over this four table- 
20 



FOR Oysters 

spoonfuls of cream, and bake in a 
quick oven about twenty minutes. 



BISQUE OF OYSTER 

Drain fifty oysters ; boil and skim 
the liquor. Chop the oysters with a 
silver knife ; add them to the liquor ; 
boil and skim again. Put one quart 
of milk in a double boiler ; rub together 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and three 
tablespoonfuls of flour ; add this to 
the hot milk ; stir constantly until 
smooth and thick as cream. Add 
one teaspoonful of celery pepper and 
the oysters. Strain through a sieve, 
pressing lightly ; add teaspoonful of 
salt, and serve at once.

OYSTERS EN COQUILLE 

Boil in their own liquor twenty- 
five fat oysters. Drain, and chop with 
a silver knife. Put one cup of milk 
in double boiler. Rub together one 
tablespoonful of butter and two of 
flour ; add gradually the hot milk, 
beating all the while. Now add yolks 
of two eggs, teaspoonful of salt, quar- 
ter teaspoonful of pepper, and a 
tablespoonful of green pepper chopped 
fine ; add the oysters, fill the mixture 
into the deep oyster shell, dust with 
dry bread crumbs, and brown in a 
quick oven. Do not keep them in 
long, or the mixture will curdle.

FOR Oysters 

OYSTERS STUFFED 

Drain twenty-five large fat oysters. 
Remove the hard part, and fill the 
space with a forcemeat made from 
quarter cup of finely chopped chicken, 
same quantity of crumbs, tablespoon- 
ful of thick cream, a half teaspoonful 
of salt, dash of paprica, all mixed well 
together. Dust the oysters with salt 
and pepper. Beat two eggs without 
separating ; add to them two table- 
spoonfuls of oyster liquor, and one 
of warm water. Dip the oysters first 
in crumbs, then in the egg mixture, 
and then again in crumbs, being care- 
ful not to lose the stuffing. Fry in 
smoking hot oil. Serve as fried oys- 
ters. In placing the stuffing, press it 

23 



Fifteen New Ways 

in without bruising the oyster, but 
sufficiently firm to keep it in its place. 



OYSTERS ON MUSHROOMS 

Drain twenty-five fat oysters, and 
put two lardoons of bacon through 
each oyster. Cut the fat part of ham 
or bacon into tiny strips ; use a small 
larding needle, and just take one stitch 
in soft part, then another, allowing the 
ends to hang. Dip each oyster in 
bread crumbs, then in egg, and then 
again in crumbs. Fry in smoking hot 
oil. Have ready a platter of baked 
mushrooms ; put the oysters on top, 
cover with brown sauce, and serve.

Peel and cut short the stems from a 
pound of good-sized mushrooms ; put 
them in baking pan, gills up ; put a 
tiny bit of butter in each, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper. Run them in a 
hot oven for fifteen minutes; then 
pour in the pan about a gill of cream 
and one gill of oyster liquor that has 
been boiled and strained ; bring to 
boiling point. Dish the mushrooms,

and then cover it closely with the 
oysters. Boil half cup of the oyster 
liquor, strain, put it in the serving 
dish, add a tablespoonful of butter, 
half teaspoonful of salt, dash of paprica. 
Now put the oysters over a clear fire,
