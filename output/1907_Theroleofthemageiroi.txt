PREFATORY NOTE 

The main subject-matter of this book was originally used 
in "a dissertation presented for the degree of Doctor of Phi- 
losophy in Classical Philology at Harvard University. Since 
that time, however, the work has undergone a careful revi- 
sion, although my conclusions are essentially the same as in 
the original thesis.

INTRODUCTION 

In a careful examination of the fragments preserved 
from the writings o^ the Greek comic poets, one must of 
necessity be impressed with the r6le which cooks in gen- 
eral played in Greek Comedy. In my own study of these 
comic fragments the material collated on this subject was 
such as to induce the belief that cooks were an important 
factor in the life of the ancient Greeks, both private and 
public, and therefore worthy of more extensive investigation 
and more careful consideration than had been accorded 
them. Hence I was led to investigate, as far as possible, 
all Greek literature, and the inscriptions as well, in the 
hope that a contribution of some value might be made to 
the study of Greek life on a subject which was apparently 
of such real importance. 

One need not go beyond a careful reading of Athenaeus 
to be convinced of the significant part which cooks played 
in the life of the Greeks from the middle of the fifth century 
before our era, or even earlier, down to the third century at 
least after the birth of Christ. Because of the form which 
Athenaeus gave to his work, under the title of Deipnoso- 
phistae, and the subjects therein discussed, the characters 
at the fictitious feast of Larensis' are represented as dis- 
coursing upon a variety of subjects concerned with feasting 
and everything pertaining to matters connected with the 
preparation of banquets and the like. Particularly is it 
true that the cook is introduced as quoting authors who 
have portrayed those of his own vocation in the Greek 
Comedy. To this fact, indeed, we owe the preservation of 
a very large number of the comic fragments. The r6le

taken by cooks may be judged somewhat from the fact that 
at least two plays are known to have been composed by 
Nicostratus and Anaxilas which bore the titles of Mdyeipot 
and Mdjeipoi respectively, while Menander wrote a play 
called At) fiiovpyof,^ In no less than thirty-three fragments/ 
moreover, Athenaeus indicates that a cook is speaking, and 
elsewhere the voice of the fidy€ipo<i is often recognizable. 
As Comedy is a mirror of the life of the times when com- 
posed, however extravagant may be its form, we see herein 
very much that is of genuine worth in the study of such a 
question as that which I propose to discuss. In fact, we 
may safely say that no other single figure is everywhere in 
evidence quite so much on the comic stage, particularly of 
the Middle and the New Comedy, as the cook in his various 
humors and numerous and important functions. 

But not only do the writings of the comic poets point to 
the significance of the cook in Greece, but Athenaeus also 
either gives the names of writers on the art of cookery and 
related arts, or else quotes from similar authors with such 
frequency that no doubt can be left in our minds as to the 
ever-increasing significance of the art with the passing of 
the centuries. And, again, the cooks are here made to 
quote the chief authorities on their own specialties in a way 
that indicates the importance of their art as known to 
Athenaeus from the life of his own times, and from a study 
of previous customs and conditions. Such books would be 
written only when there was a positive demand for them. 
Hence no sufiicient reason is apparent for the seeming

Introduction 3 

apology of A. Wellauer for having treated of the literature 
relating to eating and cooks among the Greeks in an article 
entitled "Ueber die Ess- und Kochlitteratur der Griechen," 
in Jahn^s Archivfur Philologie und Paedagogik (X [1844], 
pp. 176-94). 

The names of many of these writers are mentioned by 
cooks who appear in Comedy,' and Athenaeus refers to a 
very large number of them. It may not be amiss, there- 
fore, to make mention of a few of them here, because of the 
frequent allusions to them in Athenaeus, and thus some 
idea will be obtained of the extent to which such things 
were carried among the Greeks. Many of them, it appears, 
wrote books entitled 'OyjraprvTiKd, which dealt with every- 
thing related to 6-\jra of various kinds — that is to say, 
dainties in the line of meats. A great many of their names 
are recorded by Athenaeus.^ These writers are frequently 
quoted by the banqueters in Athenaeus and the cooks por- 
trayed by him, particularly on the methods of cooking 
varieties of fishes, the season when they should be eaten, the 
best places for obtaining them, and matters of like weight 
to the connoisseurs in the art. Among these names that of 
Mithaecus is especially famous, his book being devoted 
wholly to Sicilian cookery.* Pollux also recounts many 
names of men who wrote 'OyjroTrouKa a-vyypdfxfMara.* Books 
of a somewhat different character were the TaarpoXoyia of 
Archestratus (which went under other names also) and the 
'OyjraprvTiKal T\(aaa-ai of Artemidorus,^ the latter being a 
dictionary of cookery. There were also special works on 
special subjects, such as that of Chrysippus, who wrote on 
confectionery, with particular reference to cheese-cakes, it

would seem.' Dorotheus appears to have written on a 
special dish, fiarrvt},'^ much spoken of in the New Comedy. 
Many others might be added to this list from other writers 
quoted by Athenaeus or mentioned by various authors. 
Indeed, such writings became so frequent, and their neces- 
sary effects were so strongly felt, that writers like Plutarch 
(particularly in his Quaestiones convivales) saw fit to advise 
against such extravagant and luxurious tastes as would be 
aroused by books of this character. Their main theme is 
that voiced by Musonius (in Stobaeus, Eel. xvii, 42, 
Wachsmuth-Hense) :

Although no one of these books has been preserved en- 
tire, the quotations from them are sufficient to show that 
the influences from abroad were very powerful in increasing 
the growth of the art of cookery among the Greeks. 
Through conflicts and intercourse with oriental nations, in 
particular, many new and unheard-of customs were intro- 
duced into Greece. The establishment of colonies in other 
lands shows its influence here as well as in other depart- 
ments of Greek life and thought. Hence many names of 
dishes mentioned by Athenaeus come from Lydia, Sicily, 
and elsewhere, and the preparation of these same dishes has 
been learned from foreign cooks. But surer evidence of 
external influences is found in frequent references, especially 
in Comedy, to cooks themselves from other countries, as will 
appear in the main discussion of this subject.^ 

Passages in the Old Greek Comedy before the time of 
Aristophanes* show that the art of the skilled cook was

Introduction 6 

already an important factor in the life of the times. Indeed, 
it is not to be doubted, as allusions in the fragments pre- 
served to us indicate, that already in the plays of Epicharmus 
and other earlier comic writers questions pertaining to 
cookery were not unknown. By the time of Aristophanes 
this great poet was ready to ridicule the important place 
which such things were allowed in preceding writers.' Yet 
even he cannot refrain from presenting to his audiences 
some cooking scenes of rare interest,^ so varied and impor- 
tant were the functions of the cooks of his time, and such 
was the popular demand, because of the popular taste, for 
such spectacles. But in the Middle and New Comedy the 
cook was a still more familiar figure upon the boards. From 
this period the increase in luxurious habits of living and 
eating among certain peoples of Greece was allied with cor- 
responding extravagance in matters relating to cookery. 
These customs must have had special weight from the 
period of Alexander the Great to the time when Athenaeus 
wrote his Deipnosophists. And after an investigation of 
Greek literature we find that Athenaeus is our chief au- 
thority on this large subject, first of all by reason of the 
style of the book he composed, and again because of the 
innumerable writers mentioned or quoted in his work. 

In a coherent and full discussion of a subject of this 
kind there are very many difficulties in the way of progress, 
so many varieties of forms does it assume. To sum these 
up briefly: The kind of cook required to prepare the food 
varied for different occasions, and sometimes more than one 
kind were necessary for the same occasion. Again, the 
same title might signify the same person, but with a differ- 
ent function to perform, under different circumstances. 
And, lastly, with the lapse of years it was not impossible 
for the title of a certain kind of cook to carry with it an

ft Bdle of Mayecpoc in Ancient Greece 

entirely new signification. The lack of any complete dis- 
cussion of the subject may possibly be due, in part at least, 
to these very reasons. 

Among the passages in modern works that I have found 
on this subject, the article by E. Potter in the Dictionnaire 
des antiquiMs, grecques et romaines, of Daremberg and 
Saglio (s. V. "Coquus ou Cocus") seems to be the most 
comprehensive. Yet this makes no pretensions to an ex- 
haustive treatment of the subject, and some conclusions in 
this article are liable to change upon a more thorough study 
of all the evidence afforded in literature.' Many references 
to various aspects of the question are found scattered through 
the valuable Lehrbuch of Hermann.^ In Hugo Bltlmner's 
separate work' there are also statements regarding the prov- 
ince of those designated by certain words. Certain phases 
of the cook's life are discussed by Bekker in his Charikles.*' 
Mahaffy has, moreover, presented parts of the subject in 
popular form in his interesting book, Social Life in Greece.^ 
Wherever I have found the subject treated by other modern 
writers, I shall endeavor to give honor to whom honor is 
due. The books mentioned above contain the fullest gen- 
eral discussions I have been able to discover. 

A word is here in order regarding the method which I 
shall use in the presentation of the subject. The word fici- 
y€Lpo<i designated and included those cooks who were supreme 
in their art at the time when the most evidence is available 
concerning their profession. The discussion of these per- 
sons will therefore serve as the fundamental part of this 
work. And, furthermore, since this word fJLd<yeipo<; has not

the same signification at all times, as will be shown below, it 
has appeared most suitable to use the Greek word through- 
out this discussion. The relations of the fidyeipot to cooks 
indicated by other words will therefore be mentioned only 
in a general way. But at some future time it is my pur- 
pose to publish as a second part to this discussion the 
results of my study of material concerning the other various 
kinds of cooks. In this way it is hoped there will remain 
no doubt in the minds of those who read this dissertation as 
to the correctness of the conclusions drawn from the vast 
amount of material afforded by Greek writers regarding the 
status, the distinctions, the functions, the characteristics of 
these fjidyeipot who delighted the hearts and pleased the 
palates of so large a number of the ancient Greeks.

CHAPTER I 
DERIVATION OP THE WORD MAFEIPOS 

As regards the derivation of the word fJLdyeipo<i, the an- 
cient lexicographers refer it to the root fiay- which is found 
in fidaaoi (or /taTTw), "to knead." And so Herodianus (i, 
198, 11, 9, 10, Lentz) explains the word: Mdyeipo'i irapa 
TO fidaacD 6 ra? /j.d^a<i t^vptav,^ while Eustathius says [Com. 
in Odyss., p. 1761, 11. 34 fP.) : "Ec^?; 8e xai on rj fiayh airb 
TTpi fid^r)<; rj rov fiaareveiv prjOela-a irapdyei rov fidyecpov, S? 
OVTCO, (f>r}at, Xeyerai Trapa to fiayiSa^ aipeiv rjyovv irpoa^epeiv. 
Suidas and the Etymologicum magnum follow Herodianus 
in his explanation of the etymology of the word.'' Slightly 
varying in their tenor are the remarks of other writers on 
etymology when treating of this word, but they are generally 
agreed in referring it to the same root as occurs in the verb 
fidacro).^ 

Hence the primal signification of the word was asso- 
ciated with the making of bread. But other words were 
afterward used for "bakers,"* and the word iidyeLpo<i came 
to have a very specific meaning.^ And this view agrees with 
the statement of Paulus* (in Festus, p. 58, 14 M.) : "Cocum 
et pistorem apud antiquos eundem fuisse accepimus."

of these words.

10 Mdle of Mdyeipoi in Ancient Greece 

Before the time of Euripides and Aristophanes, there- 
fore, the word fid'yeipo^ had received another meaning, which 
was quite distinct from its root signification and primitive 
use. It was henceforth familiarly employed in its new 
sense. ^ And inasmuch as we are not familiar with the word 
as used in its original signification, it is only with the later 
meaning that we are now concerned.

CHAPTER II 

SOCIAL STATUS OF THE MArBIPOI 
I. AS DEPICTED IN HOMER 

In Homeric times the habits of life were simple. The 
food was coarse and consisted mainly of roasted meats (for 
the most part cattle), of which large quantities were pre- 
pared for particular occasions. Nor was there any distinc- 
tion made in the fare for different persons, as Athenaeus 
(i, 8/-9a) observes: 

'AirX^v ovv aTToSeScoKe ttjv Siairav wSxri Kal ttjv avrr/v ofioto)? )8a(ri-

And so even at the feast of the suitors, as Athenaeus (i, 9 6, 
c) again notes, the food is simple and plain. Yet there 
seems to have been a kind of sacred ness attaching to the 
feasts in general in the Homeric period because of the sacri- 
fices which preceded them. Hence the heroes of those days 
participated^ in the preparations for the feasts. The king

From such passages as these Athenaeus concludes (xiv, 
660c) : OuTft>? evSo^ov rjv Kal fieyicrrov to Trj<; fia'yeipiKrj'i 
rexvrj'i a^tcofia. But in reality, strictly speaking, there was 
no fjLayeipiKr} rex^rj in the Homeric period, nor did the simple 
customs of the times demand the services of the skilled pro- 
fessional cook who later appeared prominently in Greek 
life. The members of the household, whether free born or 
slaves, at that time performed the simple duties of the home 
and did not consider such labors as at all disgraceful. 
There were, of course, slaves belonging to the household, 
but no one whose special province was the culinary depart- 
ment.^ The one who approached most nearly the fidyeipo'i 
of later times, therefore, was the Sairpo^, but even this per- 
son can hardly be compared with the skilled fidyeipo^ in his 
functions.^ In brief, his duty was to dispense the meats to 
the feasters after having cut them into smaller pieces. 

The word /xdy€ipo<;, then, does not occur in Homer, nor 
do any derivatives from the same root, so far ag I have been 
able to ascertain. What is particularly to be noted, how- 
ever, is that cooking was not then looked upon as a peculiarly 
servile act. 

II. AS DEPICTED IN GREEK COMEDY 

As has already been observed, the art of the ndyeipo<i 
was well advanced at the time of the Old Comedy, and this

article. 



Social Status of the Mdyeipoc 13 

was the term used to designate the skilled professional cook.' 
This fact will be made clear in the further presentation of 
the subject, especially in the discussion of the times and 
occasions at which fjidjeipoL were employed in their profes- 
sional capacity/ To the mind of one who has studied the 
characters portrayed in Greek Comedy, particularly in the 
fragments of the Middle and New Comedy, there should be 
no doubt as to the very important r6le which /j^dyeipoL as 
a class played in the life of the times. It must be constantly 
borne in mind, however, that we are not now considering the 
condition of the domestic slaves who performed the ordinary 
duties of the household and aided in the usual daily cooking 
done at home. The /xdj€ipo<; of this and succeeding times 
was quite another character, as will appear in the course of 
this discussion. 

The attempt is here made to depict briefly the place of the 
/xdyeipoi on the comic stage more as a means to establish- 
ing their social status at the time than with the intention of 
characterizing them thoroughly, though the characteristics 
of the cook in general are largely determined from the study 
of the comic fragments, and these will be discussed more at 
length in a later chapter.' First of all, then, our attention 
is directed to 

(a) The masks of the fidyeipoi in Greek Comedy. — Here 
our most fruitful source on the character of the fidyeipo^ in 
Comedy, outside of the Comedy itself, is a passage in Athe-

The passages found in Hesychius and Eustathius are 
clearly based on the statement of Athenaeus.' But Pollux 
[Onom. iv, 148-50) also tells us — doubtless using the infor- 
mation gained from the great work of Aristophanes of Byzan- 
tium, Ilepl IlpocrcoTrcov, quoted above by Athenaeus, as Zielin- 
ski points out^ — that there were two different masks for the 
/jbdyetpoL in the New Comedy:

From these passages it is seen that the characters of the 
native /xdyeipo^ and the foreign fidyeipo<; were clearly dis- 
tinguished on the comic stage, even as late as the New Attic 
Comedy, by certain masks which bore the names of Maia-wv 
and TeTTt|, respectively. Moreover, according to Aristo- 
phanes of Byzantium, the mask of the native fidjeLpo<i was 
so named from its inventor, the Megarian actor Maeson.* 
Athenaeus further tells us (xiv. 659c) that Polemon said 
Maeson was from the Sicilian (Hyblaea) Megara. His words 
are these: Tov Se Maio-coya TloXeficov iv rot? 7r/3o? Tifiaiov ix

* Schneidewin {loc. cit. supra) would make Maeson a poet also ; but this does/ 4/ 
not so much concern us in this connection. Compare also Meineke, Frgta. com, 
Graec. I, pp. 22 ff. It may be further noted that Wilamowitz (in Hermes IX, 339 f.) 
objects to Schneidewin's " plattrationalistiche Methode." The other derivation of 
this name, Maeson (from the verb naaraar9ai,), is hardly to be accepted. But compare 
Zielinski, loc. cit. 



Social Status of the Md'yeipoc 15 

Zielinski [loc. cit.) thinks this Maeson was a comic character 
well known both to Nisaean Megara and to Hyblaean Megara. 
But while this is doubtless true as regards the character in 
Comedy, the view of Schneidewin (in Conj. crit., pp. 120-29) 
that the actor Maeson was from Nisaean Megara is, to my 
mind, more to be commended. I cannot agree with Zielin- 
ski, however, when he assumes that the comic character 
Maeson appeared in different roles. There is no evidence 
in either Athenaeus or Pollux to this effect, but the masks 
of the fidyeipoi and Oepdrrovre^ alone are mentioned in this 
connection. Zielinski makes this assumption, too, despite 
the fact that he rightly, as I think, rejects (with A. Nauck') 
the statement of Festus in a passage which has doubtless 
become corrupted in the course of the changes which this 
work has undergone. From this character of the Maeson, 
then, arose the aKonfifiara fiaiarcoviKa that were afterward 
familiar in the plays of the comic poets at Athens. 

The name Terrt^ given to the mask of the foreign fid<yeipo<i 
is not so easy of explanation. Indeed, scholars have thus 
far failed to give a satisfactory reason for the use of this 
word in this relation. It seems to be well established that 
the origin of the character Maeson was in the Dorian Comedy."^ 
Then are we to suppose, with Zielinski' and others, that the 
character of the Terrt^ did not exist alongside of that of the 
Maurcov? The mask called Maiawv represented the domestic 
IJidy€Lpo<;. But why should this type of fidy€ipo<i be specially 

iCf. A. Nauck, Arist. Byz.frgta., pp. 276, 277, where the passage from Festus is 
cited. The latter originally must have contained the quotation from Aristophanes 
of Byzantium himself. O. Ribbeck (in Alazon, p. 26) holds to the opposite view of 
the Festus passage, which he apparently accepts in its entirety. See Zielinski, 
Qtmest. com., p. 64, n. 1. 

2It is beyond the province of this discussion to dwell upon the meaning of the 
expression, "Dorian Comedy." The mask was Dorian and comic, however, in that 
it was the invention of the Megarian comic actor, Maeson. 

3Cf. Quaest. com., p. 6&: "Doricae tamen comoediae personam f uisse Tettigem 
non crediderim; etymologiam frustra odieris, veterum autem testimonia de Attico 
omnia loquuntur Tettige. lam cum Atheniensium deliciae fuerint cicadae, fieri 
potest ut Athenis primum sit inventa persona ista, ut 'Ep^oii/evs aliae."

portrayed, if there were not set over against it the class of 
the foreign /Jbdyeipoi represented by the mask called TerTi^? 
It is, moreover, noteworthy that Athenaeus says both these 
names of masks were used by those whom he calls ol TraXaioi. 
These words must refer to none other than the earliest comic 
poets, since we have no trace of any reference to these char- 
acters by name in the fragments of the Old Comedy at 
Athens. Let us therefore suppose that the mask called 
Terrtl was also familiar to Dorian Comedy. How, then, 
shall we explain the name itself? 

It is well known that the Athenians in early times wore 
representations of the cicadae in some form of ornaments as 
emblematic of their being indigenous to the soil [avroxOovei;). 
In fact, Thucydides tells us that even in his day it had not 
been long since the older Athenians left off wearing these 
golden ornaments in their hair.^ Aristophanes also refers 
to this old custom in the Nubes (983): 'Kpxeud ye kuI 
AwttoXimSt) Kol Terrcycov avd/xeara.^ This custom and notion 
of the old Athenians was doubtless well known to the people 
of Megara at that time, especially since, at the close of the 
seventh century before our era, the Megarians and Athenians 
had met in the conflict (between 610 and 600 b. c.) which 
was finally decided by arbitration in favor of the Athenians. 
This would necessarily leave feelings of hostility in the minds 
of the Megarians. What more suitable, then, than that in 
the Dorian Comedy the mask of the foreign fjidyeipo^ should 
receive its name in ridicule of a custom in a neighboring 
rival state? How could this have been more successfully 
accomplished than by having this character on the comic 
stage wear cicadae in the manner which characterized their 
neighbors, the Athenians ? In this way the Megarians might

Social Status of the Mdyeipoi 17 

also further make sport of the claim of the Athenians that 
they and the cicadae were indigenous to the soil (if we accept 
this interpretation of the custom), by calling the mask of the 
foreign fxdyeipo'i by this name. I would therefore hold — 
what seems to me most likely — that the name of the character 
TeVrt^ in Dorian Comedy originated in this reference to an 
ancient and familiar custom of the Athenians. The reputa- 
tion of Athenian fidyeipoi among other peoples of that remote 
time may have added much to the effectiveness of such a 
representation in the Dorian Comedy. 

The name would thus have been handed down to the time 
of the New Attic Comedy, along with that of Maeson, though 
its real origin had long since been forgotten in the course of 
three centuries. For it must be borne in mind that Pollux, 
in the passage quoted above, is describing the characters of 
the New Attic Comedy. It will presently be seen that the 
characters of both the domestic and the foreign ixdyeipoi 
were in evidence on the comic stage of later times, though 
Pollux may simply have applied the old names of the masks, 
as he learned them from preceding writers, to the two dis- 
tinctive types of fidjeipoi that still prevailed at the period of 
the New Attic Comedy. But the old names no longer carried 
with them the exact significance that attached to them when 
the masks were invented for use in the Dorian Comedy. 

(6) Conditions portrayed in Greek Comedy. — Let us 
next endeavor to discover as far as possible the social condi- 
tion of the fidyeipoL as portrayed under these masks in 
comedy. Here again the statement of Athenaeus quoted 
above (p. 13) claims our first attention:

18 Role of Mdyeipot in Ancient Greece 

The information contained in this passage from Athenaeus 
has an important bearing upon the social status of fidyecpot 
at the period of the Dorian Comedy. For if the actor Mae- 
son invented two separate and distinct masks for the fidyeiptyf 
and the OepaTrcov, as is clearly demonstrated, must we not 
conclude that the condition of the fidyeipoc of the time 
differed from that of the ordinary 6epdnTovTe<i ? Yet someone 
may point to the Pollux passage already quoted (p. 14), as 
proving that the fidj€ipo<i in comedy was depicted as a 
depdircov or even a 8ovXo<; (if we hold to the earlier distinc- 
tion in the use of these words). But Pollux is here discuss- 
ing the characters of the New Attic Comedy, as has been 
noted, and during this later period there seems to have been 
much more reason for such a reference to the comic charac- 
ter of the fidjeipoi,. This will be made clear below. More- 
over, it may be argued that another passage in the same 
author [Onom. iv, 118 f.), where he is discussing the comic 
dress, goes to prove that the fidy€cpo<i was not attired in 
comedy as the ordinary 8ovXo<;. His words are these : 

KcD/Auc^ Sc i(T$T^<i e$u)fii<i' eari 8k ^^itwv Xcvkos, a(nfjfJio<;, Kara Trjv

iirCppripLa. t<5 8c paycipta 8nr\^ ayvaTrros ly iaOrj^} 

A passage in Lucian (De saltatione^ cap, 29) confirms this 
belief: 

'H K<i>p(oSia Se /cat tS>v 7rpO(r<«)7rwv avTS>v to KaTayeAao-Tov /u.€/oos rov

For it must be remembered that Lucian was familiar with 
such names as these here mentioned, from the Roman comic 
poets, who commonly employed them as slave-names. In 
this place, then, Lucian apparently distinguishes between 
such slave characters as these names would indicate at his

cussed (pp. 71 f.). 



Social Status of the Mdyecpoi 19 

time on the comic stage, and the character of the fidyeipof 
in comedy. Yet our chief evidence for the Dorian Comedy 
is contained in the quotation from the work of Aristophanes 
of Byzantium preserved by Athenaeus. From this passage 
alone, however, we may safely conclude that the fidyeipo'i 
in early Greek Comedy, at least, was portrayed as a depdircav 
only in the free and honorable sense as opposed to the 
servile condition of the SoOXo? of that tirhe, while the mask 
of the fidyeipo^ indicated that he was of a social rank and 
standing dissimilar even to that of the ordinary Oepdircov. 

In the Old Attic Comedy I can nowhere find a reference 
to fidyeipot, such as would indicate a servile condition on 
their part. Wherever direct allusion is made to the fjidyeipot 
in Aristophanes, in fact, the great poet seems to imply that 
17 fiayeipLKri was the province of the skilled professional 
who, with his assistants, was employed on important occasions.* 

But in the Middle and New Attic Comedy we find our 
richest, most abundant material for determining the posi- 
tion of the fidyeipoi. The very fact that they are such an 
important figure in the Comedy of this period would lead one 
to surmise that their position was not a mean one, despite 
our recognition of the intended exaggeration of facts and 
circumstances upon the comic stage. Such things are of fre- 
quent occurrence upon the boards at the present time. But 
it is not likely that slaves should have repeatedly sustained 
so important a r6le in Greek Comedy as was that of the 
fidyeipoL during the periods of the Middle and New Comedy. 
Athenaeus is furthermore our authority for the following 
statement (xiv, 658f. ): OuSe yap av evpoi rt? vfimv hovXov 
fidyeipov riva iv kcoixmBio, ttXtjv irapa HoaeiSiTriro) ixovos. This 
is confirmed beyond a doubt by my study of the comic 
fragments. Nowhere in any of the extant fragments is the 
employer of a fxdyeipo<i addressed as a slave would address 

iCf. pp. 48 f., 52, with references there given. 



20 Role of Mdyeipoi in Ancient Greece 

his master. In every instance the fidyeipo^ acts as an inde- 
pendent person proud of his accomplishments in his art. 
As regards the condition of these characters as portrayed in 
Posidippus (who continued to write his plays long after the 
beginning of the fourth century b. c.) , the passages to which 
Athenaeus refers may be preserved by him, as Meineke 
(IV, 514 f.) has suggested, in the following (XIV, 659c):*

If we assume this to be the case, the greater is our dis- 
appointment at not being able to know how much more of 
these plays existed at the time of Athenaeus. For if it were 
permitted us to explain these two passages from plays of 
Posidippus without any reference to the statement of the 
erudite Athenaeus, I would interpret them differently from 
either Casaubon or Meineke'^ in the one instance, and from 
the generally accepted explanation of Dobree in the other." 
I would say that in both cases a vTroSiaKovo^* speaks of the 
IJ.dy€ipo<i with whom he is learning the art. In the for- 
mer passage such an assistant of a /iayei/oo? glories in the 
fact that he is now serving with such a master of the art that 
he has no more fears of being caught in the act of filching

2 See Meineke, IV, 514 f. where Casaubon's view is given, as well as his own inter- 
pretation of the fragment, 

3 See M. IV, 520, where Dobree's view is cited and adopted. 

♦ Cf. Posid. in Ath. ix, 376e (M. IV. 521 ; K. Ill, 342 ; 1. 10), where the word occurs

the meat,' at least not while in the service of so ingenious a 
person. The second fragment seems to me to confirm this 
view. This fidjeipo'; has been hired only in the sense that 
he has become a part of the retinue of a more distinguished 
disciple of the art and so says he works in the market-place. 
His superior has been employed to go into the country for 
some particular occasion, and this assistant is to accompany 
him. Hence the remark of the v7ro8tdKovo<i that he is going 
outside the gates to get his dinner.^ At any rate, however 
these passages may be interpreted, the evidence adduced by 
Athenaeus in support of his statement is very slight. And 
though we may accept the statement as true, without refer- 
ence to these quotations, we must decide from our study of 
other more important fragments of Posidippus that even this 
author did not commonly represent the fMdyeipo<i in a servile 
condition. In one of these fragments (M. IV, 513; K. Ill, 
335) someone hires a fJidy€Lpo<; in the market-place, and 
the rivalries existing between members of the profession at 
such a time are clearly depicted. Again, Posidippus (M. IV, 
521; K. Ill, 342) portrays a prince of fidyeipoi in conver- 
sation with his (TvvSidKovoi (vs. 1) who gives the advice 
(vss. 3 ff. ): Twv r}hv(T fidrayv | irdvToyv KpdricrTov iariv iv

from the same author (M. IV, 523; K. Ill, 344), a fxd'yeipo'; 
boasts of one of his profession and compares him to a general 
in the midst of the conflict as he mee^ the ravenous mouths 
that are ready to make depredations on his dainty dishes. 
Athenaeus says, moreover, elsewhere (xiv, 661d):* Kat

hnnc coquum apud forum isto die conduxerat."

fidy€ipo<i. It is noteworthy that Alexis belongs to the transi 
tion period from the Old Comedy to the New. 

Nor should we consider the position of the /xdyeipoi as a 
slavish one because of the ill treatment accorded them, as 
depicted by some writers of the New Comedy, for this seems 
to have happened mainly when a /Mdyeipof was employed by 
young sports of the time for some festive occasion.' Besides, 
fragments might be quoted which show a distinct regard for 
the feelings of the fidyeipof.^ And there was a familiar 
proverb regarding the treatment of the fidy€ipo<i given by 
Eubulus to this effect (M. Ill, 235; K. II, 184) :'

Ou8c eis

which further appears to point to a common interest preva- 
lent among members of the profession. 

The p.dy€Lpo<i, therefore, was certainly not represented 
in the character of a slave on the comic stage — so far as the 
comic fragments indicate — up to the time of Posidippus, 
and even then very rarely.* 

1 Cf. Diphilus, in Ath. vii, 292c (M. IV, 394 ; K. II, 553 ; 11. 26 ff.) ; also Archedicus, 
in Ath. VII, 2946 (M. IV, 436; K. Ill, 277).

* Too much must not be inferred from the fact that the Roman comic poets who 
imitated the writers of the New Attic Comedy depicted the cooks as in a slavish con- 
dition. While Plautus and Terence drew largely from Greek sources, they would 
nevertheless be likely to represent menials of their own times as slaves in their imi- 
tations or adaptations of plays from the Greek. Moreover, the nayeipot. were not the

We next turn to the consideration of the evidence at our 
disposal outside of Comedy. 

III. AS DEPICTED OUTSIDE OF COMEDY 

(a) Before 300 B. C. — Too much stress must not be laid 
upon the statement quoted by Athenaeus (xiv, 661e) from 
writers on cookery: 

Kat ol TO. 'Oij/apTXTruca 8k crvyyp<ul/avT€<; HpoKAet'Sr;? re koX FAavKOS 
6 AoKpos ov^ apfioTTeiv ifyaal <[ ' ' SovAowrt^ rr/v fiayeipixrjv, dAA' ov8k rots 
Tv\ov<Ti tS)v iXevOepwv." 

And yet such a statement seems to be confirmed by the 
public honors conferred on the fidyeipoi in certain places. 
Timaeus/ for example, says that certain persons were crowned 
at public feasts of the Sybarites, iv oh aT€<f>avov(rdai koX 
T(tiv fiayeipcov rois aptara rd Traparedevra hLaaKev(iaavra<i. 
Cleidemus also gives evidence of the condition of the fidyeipoi, 
according to Athenaeus (xiv, 660a) :^ 

"Ort 8k (Tifxvov ^v ■^ fxayupuir) /xadetv eoriv ck twv Adi^vrjci Kiypiicwv. 
ol8e yap futyeiptDV /cai JSovtvttwv eTrei^ov To^iv, ws <f>r)<TLV KAci'Siy/Aos iv 
IIpwToyovtas Trpwrw. 

Cleidemus apparently refers to this same office of the fidyeipoL 
as public functionaries in another passage quoted by Athe- 
naeus (xiv, 660 d) :^ 

'Ev 8k Tw Trpwro) rrjs 'At^iSos KAciSiy/itos <f>v\ov airo<f}aCv€i fiayeipwv 
i^ovToiv 8rjfiiovpyuca<i rifias, ots Koi to TrXrjdos cvc/oyciv ipyov rjv. 

Among the Spartans, we learn from Herodotus (vi, 60), the 
art of the fidyupo^ was an inherited one: 

only class of cooks depicted in the New Attic Comedy. The Roman writers very prob- 
ably chose to portray the condition of the class that most nearly accorded with the 
status of cooks in their own day. 

1 Cf. Athen. xii, 519 d and e; F. H. 6. 1, 205. 

2 Cf . F. H. G. I, 362. The entire passage will be discussed at greater length in a 
subsequent chapter. See pp. 55 f. 

3 Cf. F. H. G. I, 359. The latter part of the text is evidently corrupt. Possibly 
ivepytlv here may be equal to tvtpytTelv, as Schweighftuser has suggested {cui h. I.).

We may compare also the statement in Athenaeus (iv, 
172/-1736) regarding the Delian fidyeipoi.* All these pas- 
sages apparently refer directly to the fidjeipot in their 
public official capacity. Can we doubt that they were not 
slaves who were thus honored? Surely there is nothing in 
the quotations cited above to lead one to suppose they were 
in a servile condition, while the use of such words as Biuko- 
vcov and such expressions as p^ayeipav exovTwv Srjp^covpyiKa^ 
Tip.d'i with reference to them naturally leads us to conclude 
that no allusion can here be made to ordinary slaves. 

But these are not the only references to the older pi^d^eipoi 
among the Greeks. The first Olympian victor was a. p-djet- 
/309, according to Athenaeus (ix, 3826):" Kairoi koI 6

tradition should have prevailed among fidyeipoi as famous 
as those of the Eleans appear to have been.' Reference is 
made to the wife of an Elean p>dy€ipo<i by the writer of a 
speech that has been transmitted to us under the name of 
Demosthenes. * This Nicarete is mentioned as 'Kapiaiov

a freedman. There seems to be satisfactory evidence at hand 
of a certain Thearion, a baker, having been an Athenian 
citizen.^ Much more may we suppose, from all the evidence 
adduced, that in the earliest times the p-dyeipoi were often 
likewise citizens. But especially do frequent references in 
Plato and other writers in early times indicate that rj fiayei-

(6) After 300 B. C. — That a change in the condition 
of the fidyeLpo<i began to be noticeable during the first half 
of the third century before Christ seems to be proved from 
numerous references in late authors, but more particularly 
from statements made by Athenaeus. Noteworthy are these 
words of Athenaeus (xiv, 659a): AoOXot 8' oyjroTroiol iraprfK-

ever-increasing conquest, therefore, came a corresponding

certain peoples. The skilled /jbdyeipoi were doubtless taken 
along with the spoils of war in Macedonian times, and thus 
became a part of the domestic retainers of kings and

princes. The statement of Athenaeus seems to be confirmed 
by a story told by Plutarch [De lib. educ. 11, B and C) 
concerning one of the Antigonid kings (277-168 B. c). 
Here the mention of an ap'^^ifidyeipof; goes to show that there 
were other fidyeipoi in the royal household. This man was 
intrusted with a commission of some importance. Plutarch's 
account is as follows:^ 

AvTtyovov ok tov ySao'tXea twv MokcSovcdi/ eTep6<f}6aXfxov ovra ttjv

The explanation of the author may be justly taken as apply- 
ing only to the condition of the fidy€ipo<i in much later times, 
with which he himself was familiar. 

Certainly, by the time of Athenaeus /ndyeipoi had become 
a regular part of the household, as we learn from his work 
(vi, 2756) :

Those of moderate means, therefore, as well as the rich, in 
the time of Athenaeus had skilled fidyeipoL among the ser- 
vants of the house. The existence of this state of affairs is 
lamented by such a writer as Clement of Alexandria (p. 268, 
Potter) :

1 The story is told about the rhetorician Theocritus, who was punished (11 C) 
for the reply made to the jiayeipos here mentioned. 



Social Status of the Mdyeipoi 27 

The rich, as often happens, carried things to excess, so that 
we hear of one wealthy man who compelled his ixdyeipot, 
to learn the dialogues of Plato and recite them as the food 
was served to the guests at table.' But such practices were 
generally discountenanced, Athenaeus seems to say. It may 
be inferred that some of the fidyeipoi, at least, were not 
uneducated. Still the personal characteristics of the skilled 
IJidy€tpo<; apparently do not differ greatly from those fidyeipoi 
of former times, if we may judge from the description of the 
imaginary feast in Athenaeus. Indeed, professional fidyei- 
poi who were not a part of any household probably still 
existed. 

The fidyeipoL (in a technical sense) having become so 
much more common, they were naturally treated with much 
less regard than in their palmy days of the past. This was 
sometimes carried to an extreme, so that Epictetus condemns 
[Dissert, iii, 19, 5) the unjust treatment at the hands of 
the pedagogues of the time:

Passages in Lucian point to a like estimation of the condition 
of the fidyeipoi.'^ Their actual condition as late as Athe- 
naeus is very clearly demonstrated in his book, which has 
already been quoted many times. A striking passage is the 
following (x, 420e):

And a fiar/eipo'i at the banquet of the Deipnosophistae is

many similar passages in Athenaeus we see that the fidyeipoi 
of that time brought the food into the dining-room, engaged 
in conversation with the guests, and frequently described 
the process of preparing some dish on which they prided 
themselves/ They received their due meed of praise 
from the epicureans present at such times.^ Yet they are 
spoken of as 6 7rat9 or even o aTiytiaria<i (though in jocular 
vein).' 

Hence we must conclude that, though the title of /xdyei- 
/309 continued to be applied to the professional cook of late 
Greek times,* its significance, as regarded his social position, 
from the third century before our era underwent consider- 
able changes in accordance with the general changed condi- 
tions of life. 

iCf. Athen. ix, 381o, where a fiayeipos describes how he cooked a pig to the 
delight of the guests; ix, 406a, where the dish rhodonia is described; ziv, 662e, 
where a it-dyeipo^ explains the preparation of a dish that bears the name of mvm>*

CHAPTER III 

NAMES OF MArEIPOI 

It has seemed worth while to consider the names which 
fidyeipoi have in Greek literature, especially since a recent 
writer' contends that these names, even in the Greek Comedy, 
indicate the condition of slaves for the fMciyeipoi. No 
attempt will be made to prove that the social condition of 
fjkdyeipoi can be determined at all from the names they 
possessed, but simply that it is not demonstrable that their 
names are indicative of their standing. A number of such 
names found in inscriptions are also included for the sake of 
completeness. 

These names easily fall into two convenient groups: 
(1) those names which occur in Greek Comedy; (2) those 
names which are found outside of the Comedy. 

First, then, let us eliminate those names which evidently 
do not belong to fidyeipoi. In Comedy we find the famous 
baker [aproKOTrof) Thearion (Arist., in Ath. iii, 112e) ;^ 
the T/oa7re^o7roto9 Dracon (Diph., in Ath. vii, 291/) ; the 
noted oyfroTToto^ Simos (Alexis, in Ath. iv, 1646); Syrus, 
who may not be any sort of a cook (Eriphus, in Ath. iv, 
131 d). Outside of Comedy are 1;he names of Cyrebus, 
apTOTTOLO'i (Xen., Mem. ii, 7, 6) ; Cyniscus, apra^io^ 
[I. G. A., Roehl, 543) ; Coecoa, not necessarily a cook 
(Sophron, in Ath. ix, 380e and 409a). These names, con- 
sequently, do not concern us in our present discussion. 

Again, there are a few names of foreign fMayeipoc who, 
we may suppose, were never in Greece proper. As such may

30 Role of Mar/eipoL in Ancient Greece 

be mentioned Cadmus, fidyeipo^ of a Syro- Phoenician king 
(Ath. xiv, 658 e and /) ; Pelignas, the skilled fidy€ipo<i 
of Alexander the Great, according to Athenaeus (xiv, 659/) ; 
Soterides,^ whose skill deceived king Nicomedes (Euphron, 
in Ath. i. Id) ; Batrachion,^ of Larissa, who is compared 
(in Lnc, Adv. Ind. 21, 117) to Pyrrhus, king of Epirus; 
Entropion, apxi/J'dyeipo'i (Plut., Mor. 11 B, C) of Anti- 
gonus, king of the Macedonians. These names would not 
affect whatever conclusions we may finally draw, however; 
for no one would hold that Cadmus is a distinctive slave- 
name, Pelignas occurs only in this passage, Soterides is 
mentioned in Comedy only in the *two places cited above, 
Entropion is a name rarely used. 

Having eliminated these names, we now proceed with the 
consideration of the other names in the manner indicated 
above, and shall endeavor to discover ( 1 ) the significance of 
the names of /xdyeipoi which are found in Greek Comedy. 
Here we must distinguish between (a) names invented for 
comic effect; (6) names of men probably mere writers on the 
art of cookery; (c) names of real persons not fidjeipot at all, 
but represented as such in Comedy; (d) names indicative of 
the calling; (e) names of fia7€t/3ot proper; (/) names that 
might possibly be slave-names. 

Taking up these groups of names in succession, under 
(a) must be placed the name Lycus (Euphron, in Athen. 
ix, 379(i), which, though a good Athenian name,^ is evi- 
dently chosen to suit the character of a fidy€ipo<i who is 
noted for his habits of filching. This apt pupil is just about 
to leave the tutelage of his great teacher in the art and 
clearly cannot be said to be in the condition of a slave. 

1 Pape (WOrterbuch der griechischen Eigennamen, s, v.) does not distinguish 
between this man and the person mentioned by Euphron as quoted in Ath. ix, 377d — 
wrongly, to my mind. 

2 The name occurs only in this passage. 

3 Cf . Kirchner, Prosopographia Attica, s. v, ; Pape, «. v. 



Names of May et pot 31 

(6) Here our attention is first attracted to the names 
which Euphron (M. IV, 486; K. Ill, 317) saw fit to give 
to the seven sages in the art of the fidyeipof; as they are 
described by a learned teacher of the art in a fragment of 
the 'ABe\(f>OL; Agis the Rhodian,' Aphthonetus, Ariston, 
Chariades the Athenian,^ Euthunus, Nereus the Chian, 
Lamprias. These are fidyeipoi noted for their specialties 
and may have been writers on the art. Their names, at 
least, cannot be said to denote, of themselves, a slavish con- 
dition. In fact, Pape (s. vv.) cites all the names excepting 
Ariston (which is not given for this passage)' as those of 
fjbdyeipoi only for this passage. Moreover, names like Agis, 
Ariston, Chariades, Euthunus are quite familiar, not to say 
distinguished, Greek names, while Nereus would hardly be 
thought of as a characteristic slave-name. Names such as 
Aphthonetus, Ariston, and Euthunus are, because of their 
etymological signification, very well adapted to men dis- 
tinguished in their art. Lamprias is also a citizen name 
elsewhere. Anaxippus (in Ath. ix, 403e) gives us two 
other names of fidyeipoi noted in their art. These fidyeipoi, 
Sophon and Damoxenus, whose teacher was the Sicilian 
Labdacus, could scarcely be called slaves because of their 
names, especially since the former is also the name of a poet 
of the New Comedy and the latter occurs but rarely. Lab- 
dacus is the name of a fidycLpo^i only in this passage. Sophon 
is mentioned as a writer on the art by Baton (in Ath. xiv, 
662c) and Pollux {Onom. vi, 70). Baton also mentions as 
writers on the art Semonactides (a name found only here), 
Tyndarichus (also in Pollux vi, 71), and Zopurinus. 
Patanion (which appears to be an invented name; compare 

1 Cf. Athen. xii, 516c. 

« Cf . Sosipater in Ath. ix, 377/ (M. IV, 482 ; K. Ill, 314 ; vs. 11) . 

8 Despite Meineke's objections {loc. cit.) to this name, it must be retained, I 
think, until some more satisfactory suggestion is made than the loss of a verse after 
TB. 10. The verbs are easily supplied in vss. 7-10 from 5i/(e in vs. 6. 



32 Role of Mayeipot in Ancient Greece 

iraravrj) seems to have been a popular teacher in the art 
(Philetaer, in Ath. iv, 169e), his pupils outnumbering those 
of Stratonicus.' But a particularly famous name was that 
of Sicon, the leading spirit in the art, according to Sosipater 
(in Ath. ix, 377/). This is a good Athenian name else- 
where, and so the fact that some writers^ use it as a slave- 
name does not argue for the slavish condition of this man. 

(c) The comic effect of the character of a fidj€Lpo<; in a 
fragment of Damoxenus (in Ath. iii, 102a) is heightened 
by his claim that he was a disciple of the wise Epicurus. 
The Greek word aka^ovda expresses his chief trait as here 
depicted. 

(d) Boedion is mentioned as a fidjeipo^ by Sosipater (in 
Ath. ix, 377/), the name occurring only here. This fMayetpiK 
was probably noted for his skill as a butcher of cattle.^ 

(e) Daedalus and Thibron may have been noted fidyeipoi 
at Athens at the time of Philostephanus (in Ath. vii, 
292/-293a). These names are used of fxdyeipoi only in this 
passage. They are common enough without having any 
stigma attached, Thibron was even nicknamed Peras 
("Perfection") because of his skill. Alexis (in Ath. ix, 
383c) has a fidyeipof; of an ingenious nature whose name, 
Glaucias, may have been due to his color. Seuthes is com- 
pared to a general in Posidippus (in Ath, ix, 3776), The 
name occurs only here of a fidyeipoi;. Another name, Leucon, 
employed by Posidippus (in Ath. ix, 376e) is not a slave- 
name as used here, for Leucon is a pupil of the great master 
who is speaking on this occasion. It might easily be a slave- 
name elsewhere, 

(/) Yet some may still contend that there is positive 
evidence of the condition of the /idyeipoi in such names as 
Dromon and Carion. The former occurs in a fragment of 

1 Usually referred to the noted cithara-player, but not necessarily so, I tbink. 
It may here be the name of another great master in the art of cookery. 
2Cf,Arist.,£ccJes.867, 3Cf.pp, 64ff, 



Names of Mdyeipoi 33 

Dionysius (in Ath. ix, 381c). Nothing can be proved as 
to the social standing of the fxayeipoi here, however, for 
Dromon is represented as a pupil under the instruction of a 
noted master in the art. It is found only here as the name 
of a fxdyetpo^, and, indeed, in another fragment, of Euphron 
(in Ath. ix, Slid), the same name is applied to a club 
member who employs a fidyeipo'i for a stated occasion. 

The name Carion is not so easily disposed of. Yet even 
here the only passage in which we have certain evidence of 
the use of the name in a comic writer is in a fragment of 
Euphron (in Ath. ix, Slid). Fortunately, the fragment is 
sufficiently long to make it clear that Carion is not a slave, 
for he has just had an experience as chef for clubmen and 
is now about to accompany another fidyeipo^: to a marriage 
feast. This at least proves that the name is not always used 
in Comedy, not even in the New Comedy, of slaves. So far, 
so good. But there are two other passages quoted in late 
writers, that may both have arisen from Comedy, in which 
this name occurs of a fidyeipo'i. The passage from Alciphron 
(3, 53, 1) is referred to Comedy by Kock.' But the frag- 
ment proves nothing as to the real condition of the fidyeipot. 
In fact, it is not distinctly stated that Carion was a /xdyeipo^. 
The fidyeipof; 6 KmficoBiKOfi is recognized, however, in the 
passage in Themistius {Or. 21, 262c) by his personal 
characteristics. But here again we cannot discover any 
proof of the condition of Carion. Still someone may argue 
that the name is commonly used of slaves." True, but I 
have shown that the fi,dy€ipo<i of this name in Euphron was 
not a slave, and this is the only passage from Comedy by

which we can really judge the condition of a ndy€ipo<i who 
bears this name. 

So far as I know, these are the only names of fidyeipoi 
that occur in extant Comedy. It has at least been demon- 
strated that the social status of the fidyeipoi, as herein por- 
trayed, cannot be judged from the names applied to them. 
It must be remembered, moreover, that this fact is not used 
as an argument in proof of what seems to me to be true con- 
cerning their condition. There is too great an element of 
uncertainty involved in such a course of reasoning. Doubt- 
less names of men in high oflBcial public positions may have 
been applied to the fxdjeipoi on the Greek stage, and the 
real condition of the characters was portrayed in the situa- 
tions presented rather than in any names that might be 
employed. 

Finally, let us consider (2) the names of fidyeipoc outside 
the Greek Comedy. Here the material is largely drawn 
from inscriptional evidence. Plato [Gorg. 518 B) refers to 
Mithaecus, ' the writer on Sicilian cookery, and [Pseudo-] 
Demosthenes (59, 18) mentions the /xdyeipo'i Hippias, hus- 
band of a certain Nicarete. Nicarete is a freedwoman of 
one Charisius and follows a trade of her own, so that Hip- 
pias would hardly be a slave of Charisius. At any rate, his 
name does not stand for any such servile condition. The 
other references in literature are from late writers. A 
IJ,dy€ipo<; at the banquet of the Deipnosophistae (Ath. ix, 
3826) boasts that the noted Elean Coroebus was one of his 
profession.^ This may be simply a vainglorious statement 
of the fidy€ipo<i, or it may contain a grain of truth in that 
the Olympian victors ofPered sacrifices to the gods after their 
successful encounters. In this sense Coroebus may have 

1 Cf . Athon. iii, 112d. 

2Cf. Eustathius on II. A, 697 (p. 879, 1. 39), where Athenaeus is quoted. At the 
time of Eustathius, or even of Athenaeus, it must be borne in mind, the condition of 
the jmayctpoi had undergone a decided change. 



Names of Mdyeipoi 35 

had the attributes of a fidy€ipo<i.^ In Athenaeus also we find 
a fidy€tpo<i named Sophon, who was probably a namesake of 
the noted writer on the art/ 

The inscriptions relating to fidyeipoL are for the most part 
late and refer to them generally in their capacity in connec- 
tion with sacrifices.' The earliest of such inscriptions is 
apparently that in Roehl, Imagines,* p. 35, No. 2. The 
Callistratus here mentioned was doubtless some distin- 
guished fidyeipo^i in the temple of Aesculapius, as Kabbadias* 
points out. The name is a good one and needs no further 
comment. The names Heracleodorus and Pataecus occur 
in an Attic inscription [C. I. A. IV, 7756, col. ii, 4 and 
col. iii, 30). These fidyeipoi had made votive offerings to 
the gods because of their success in lawsuits in which they 
were involved. Evidently they are not slaves. Another 
inscription (in Cauer, Delectus^, 356) contains part of the 
name of a iJ,dyeipo<;, IlovdoyiT\^a)v~\. With the exception of 
the names Agathon (on a gravestone of Roman times [I. G. 
Sept. 1, 1562] ) and Ammonas and Dioscorus [Oxyrh. Papyr, 
CXVIII, 33, 34, of the third century A. d.), the other names 
on inscriptions all relate to oflBcials connected with sacrifices

36 Role of Mdyeipoi in Ancient Greece 

All these names but Syntrophus, Pasacon, and Epaphrodei- 
tus are common ones. These three are cited by Pape only 
for inscriptions. Epaphrod^tus is also an ordinary name. 
The condition of these fidyeipoL in their official capacity will 
be treated in a later chapter.' It may be observed, however, 
that most of the evidence outside of Comedy is much later 
than the third century b. c. Hence any conclusion regard- 
ing the use of these names would probably not affect my 
previous conclusions with respect to the social status of the 
fidyeipoi before 300 B. c. They can at least not be said in 
themselves to point to a servile condition of the fidyeipot.

CHAPTER IV 

ORIGIN OF THE MAFEIPOl 

As regards the region of the Greek world from which 
fidyeipoi came, the comic fragments furnish sufficient evidence 
that they were not limited to any single district or country. 
Yet the Greeks had their favorite fidyeipoi, just as we have 
our noted chefs today, and certain localities were famous for 
the training of these fidyeipoi. 

The Attic fidyeipoL were distinguished, it appears, for at 
least one dish, which the Greeks called dplov.^ It was be- 
cause of his skill in making a particular kind that Chariades 
{^ov^ *A6r)V(av, vs. 7) was said to have been counted among 
the seven sages of the art in former times, if we may trust 
the words of a fidyeipo<; in a fragment of Euphron (M. IV, 
486; K. Ill, 317). Dionysius (M. Ill, 547; K. II, 423; 
vss. 36-42) apparently represents another Attic fjidyeipo^ 
who boasts of his knowledge of the art and especially men- 
tions the dish Oplov:

Here we see the native Attic fidy€ipo<i contrasting his skill 
with that of one from abroad. We also hear of a distinguished 
Athenian fidyeipoi; in Philostephanus (M. IV, 589; K. Ill, 

iCf. Arist., Acharn. 1102, and scholiast on this passage. 

37

393) who has attained perfection in his art, to judge from 
his nickname of Peras (vs. 3). And yet Attic dinners were 
much ridiculed by some of the writers of Comedy. And so, 
when a Thessalian is to be entertained, an Attic fxdyeipo'i will 
not suit the occasion, according to Alexis (M. Ill, 480; K. 
11,375):'

This is the explanation of the passage by Athenaeus where 
he quotes it (iv, 137c). The dislike of foreigners for Attic 
fare is amusingly portrayed in Lynceus, as well as their con- 
tempt for Attic stinginess.^ The Perinthian speaks as fol- 
lows (M. IV, 433; K. Ill, 274; vss. 1-16):

In an enumeration of what various places were noted for, 
Antiphanes (M. Ill, 138; K. II, 115) heads the list with 
e| "H\a8o9 fidy€ipo<;, so that the fidyeipoi from there must have 
had a fair repute in the art. A boastful /xdjeipo'; in Epicra- 
tes (M. Ill, 369; K. II, 284), moreover, uses these words: 

'Etti Toio-S' cyo)

Elis is here classed with Sicily, then, whence, as we shall 
presently see, came most noted cooks. 

An Acarnanian is also mentioned by Anaxippus (M. IV, 
459; K. Ill, 296), but it is to be noted that this Sophon 
is a disciple of a Sicilian p.dyeLpo<i. Sophon, however, is 
also a teacher of the art (vs. 19) and iraaav rrjv 'leoviav ex^i. 

In Greece proper mention should likewise be made of the 
Laconians, who were famous for their black broth. Plutarch 
( Vit. Lycurg. 46 E ; Inst. Lacon. 236 F) says that Laconian 
fidyeipoL were bought by certain kings in order to make trial 
of this specialty of theirs. 

A certain Tyndarichus, a Sicyonian, is referred to by 
Baton (M. IV, 501 ; K. Ill, 327) as one whose books on the 
art are read assiduously. 

But on the mainland the Thessalians are especially noted 
for their fine tables, as Eriphus (M. Ill, 559; K. II, 430) 
says. This is established by a statement of Athenaeus 
(xiv, 662 f.):

40 Rdle of Mdyeipoi in Ancient Greece 

Yet by far the most famous fidjetpoi appear to have come 
from Sicily. We have seen above how the Sicilian Labda- 
cus was represented (in Anaxippus, M. IV, 459; K. Ill, 296) 
as the teacher of other famous fxdyeipoi, and how a boastful 
fidyeipo'; in Epicrates (M. Ill, 369; K. II, 284) declares 
that not even Sicily can boast of such a /xdyeipof as he in the 
cooking of fish. In Plato {Gorg. 518 B), moreover, we read 
of a certain Mithaecus 6 r'qv o-^oiroiCav a-vyjeypa^oy; rrjv "^ikc- 
XiKrfv, and this same writer speaks of ^iKeXiKr^v iroiKiXiav 
o^jrov in Mep. 404 D. It is not surprising, therefore, when 
Ephippus tells us (M. Ill, 338; K. II, 262) that Sicilian 
methods of cooking are favorably known. Let us note his 
words, probably spoken by a fxdyeipo'i :

7] ^tKcAtKO); oTTT^v TTOLrjao); B. SiKcAucw?. 

The fame of Sicilian cookery is further attested by Athe- 
naeus (xii, 518c) : Aia^orjroi 8' elcrlv iirl rpv(f>7j xal ai tmv 
"EiKeXwv rpdire^ai. Antiphanes, too, mentions (M. Ill, 49; 
K. II, 48) St/ceXwr Se rej^i'ai? "qZwdelaai, | hano^i SiaOpv/Mfia- 
Tt'8€9. In a fragment of Alexis (M. Ill, 394; K. II, 306) a 
fidy€cpo<i apparently makes this boast: 

OvTWS 8' OXJ/OTTOUIV €V<f>vS><i

He had learned the art in Sicily. Even the sweet odors of 
Sicilian cookery seem to have been readily recognized, as a 
fragment of Cratinus Junior (M. Ill, 374; K. II, 289) 
indicates :

Origin of the Mdr/etpoc 41 

It is scarcely to be wondered at, then, that Philemon called 
one of his plays 2t/ceXt/co?/ wherein he doubtless portrayed 
(M. IV, 24; K. II, 498) those arts of the Sicilian /xdyeipoi, 
that were most famous, 

Greeks on other islands, also, were well known as fidyeipoi. 
Athenaeus (i, 25e,/) informs us that the Chians were noted 
in this line: 

^2s dvaKVTTTeiv to? StKcXtKa; Koi ^vfiapiTiKo.^ [xai 'iToAtKasJ rpairi-

Umi iroXv 
a/oiCT' avivp-qKacriv oipaprvriKtiv. 

And so in Baton (M. IV, 501; K. Ill, 327) a Chian writer 
on the art is mentioned, while Euphron (M. IV, 486; K. Ill, 
317) numbers a Chian (vs. 6) and a Rhodian (vs. 5) among 
the seven sages in the art of former times. Another Rho- 
dian is mentioned by Anaxippus (M. IV, 459; K. Ill, 296) 
who was an innovator in introducing certain condiments that 
eventually resulted in his own death (vs. 17). 

Many separate dishes were introduced among the Greeks 
from foreign countries. So we read in Machon (M. IV, 496 ; 
K. Ill, 324) of a dish which the Macedonians apparently 
brought into Attica. And Lydian dishes, such as the can- 
daulus (M. Ill, 284; K. II, 224), are frequently mentioned 
and discussed in Athenaeus. We shall see in a later chapter 
(pp. 86 ff.) how each /xdyeipoi of any note had his own par- 
ticular dish on which he prided himself. 

1 Cf. play of same title by Diphilus, M. IV, 409; K. II, 564, and aee M. I, 4.56 



CHAPTER V 

RESORT OF THE MArEIPOI 

As will presently be made clear, fidyeipoi were hired for 
special occasions of various kinds. On this account it was 
quite necessary that there should be a particular resort where 
they might be found whenever their services were desired. 
That there was in reality a place where these professional 
fidyeipoL had their headquarters is demonstrated in a frag- 
ment of Diphilus (M. IV, 394; K. II, 553). Here a iJ,ciry€ipo<; 
in conversation with a rpaire^oTroio^; states the principles upon 
which he conducts his profession, with particular reference 
to the persons to whom he hires. In this connection, how- 
ever, the following verses (28-33) are of most interest to us: 

'Atto (rvfipoXS)v (TvvdyovTa vij At" ere/aa irov 
ive^aXev cis tov Kepafxov ivtvp-qfii-va,

The young sports' of that time knew, therefore, that these 
professional fidyeipoi could be found in the pottery market.^ 
It was hither, also, that the parasites betook themselves to 
learn who was to hire a fidyeipo<; for an entertainment, as 

1 " Adolescentes pauperculi et ad summam inopiam redacti," as the learned 
Meineke would explain this reference {Praef. Menand., p. xvii), are not the persons, 
it seems to me, to whom allusion is here made. In the first place, the offers of such 
persons would not be considered by ixa.yei.poi. And, again, such treatment as here 
depicted would not be endured at any time, if the professional fjuxyeipoi knew their 
pay would surely not be forthcoming at the proper time. 

2 It is scarcely necessary to comment on the fact that icepa/ioy is used here of the 
place in which pottery was sold. Examples of such usage are far too numerous to 
require citation. 

42 



Resort of the Mdjeipot 43 

Alexis states in a fragment preserved from his Fugitive 
(M. Ill, 501; K. II, 391): 

'Aei y' 6 Xatpe^Sv Tiv' cvpiaKti TiyvrfV'

Tov e<rTiS)VTa, t^s 6vpa<i )(a<Tfi<t)fi€vr]<i 
av iTTiXafi-qrai, TrpcoTOS cttrcXi^Av^ev. 

Athenaeus, furthermore, says (vi, 229c) that such wares as 
would be bought in the pottery market were used at feasts 
up to the Macedonian times. Hence it was a convenient 
and suitable place for the congregating of fidyeLpqL, as indi- 
cated in the comic fragment just quoted. It was doubtless 
here that the scene described by Posidippus (M. IV, 513; 
K. Ill, 335) took place in connection with the hiring of a 
fid'yupo';} As Meineke (IV, 559) has pointed out, the con- 
versation depicted in a fragment of Athenio also took place 
in ea fori parte .... uhi coquorum statio erat. 

In the Posidippus fragment, in particular, we see that 
there was sometimes eager and spirited rivalry between 
fidyeipoi here assembled upon the occasion of some employer's 
seeking their services. 

It remains for us to decide whether there was biit the one 
place in the market where these fidyecpoi might be expected 
to be in waiting to be employed. According to Pollux 
{Onom. ix, 48), there were certain places called fiayeipela 
where fidyeipoi were hired: 

Eti^ 8' av Kal fxayeipeta tcuv ttoXcws [xepdv, oi;( ^^ep to. Xoiva rStv

CIS TOVlj/OV. 

' See p. 78, where the fragment is quoted. 



44 Edle of Mdyeipoi in Ancient Greece 

It is noteworthy also that Pollux quotes a writer of the New 
Comedy on the use of this word. His words clearly signify 
that the fiayeipela were distinct parts of the city, though not 
in the same way in which the other shops of the various 
professions and trades were, because of the very fact that 
fidyeipoi were hired at these places. The meaning of rov^ov 
in the Antiphanes passage is clear.' A passage in Theo- 
phrastus [Charakt. 6), where he speaks of the abandoned 
man, will assist us in understanding what is meant by 
fiaycLpeia. This character is spoken of as 

OvK aTTOooKLfid^oiv .... €<fio8ev€iv TO. fiayuptia, to. l)^9voTru>\ia, ra rapL- 
■)(pTT<aXui, Kol Tovs TOKovs oiTO Tov i/j.iToXyiJMTO'i £19 TTjv yvdOov €/<Aeyeiv. 

Here ra fiayeipeia are evidently butchers' stalls,'' which we 
know to have been in the market-place.' That some fidyeipoc, 
at least, followed the trade of butchers will presently be seen.* 
It is quite conceivable, then, that such places might become 
the headquarters, as it were, of other fidyeipoi, who were mostly 
employed for special occasions. And in this respect these 
fiay€ipela would not be parts of the city in the same sense in 
which were the shops that pertained to other arts and trades, 
as Pollux says. We may then readily explain the short frag- 
ment quoted from Antiphanes by supposing that a scene in 
the market is depicted, of which these words give us a hint. 
The host of some occasion hurried into the market to the 
rendezvous of the fidyeipoi to secure the services of one of 
their number, and then in precipitate haste (^ifi^aXdyv) went 
on to purchase viands (particularly dainties in the way of 
fish) for the dinner or feast. I cannot agree with Meineke, 

1 Cf. Schol. ad Aesch., Timarch., §65: Toi^ov : o eo-nv iv Tjj iyop^, iv0a to. 6i^a, oiovel

*Seepp. C4ff. 



Resort of the Mdyeipoi 45 

therefore, when he says [Praef. Menand., p. xvii) that the 
Kepafjio<i and fJLayeipelov were identical in this respect.' 

It may be further noted that this word fiayecpelov^ is used 
of a kitchen, without regard to its position, in these passages : 
Aristotle, De animal, hist., i, 43, 629a, 33; De mirah. auscul- 
tat., 35, 833 a, 3; Schol. Arist., Vesp. 936. The word may 
apply equally well to a butcher's shop or a kitchen in the 
fable of a dog that steals the meat from a fiayeipelov; of. 
Aesop 232 (Halm), Babrius 79 (Rutherford). Nor do I 
think it necessary to interpret the word as used of a confec- 
tioner's shop in De suhlimitate, xliii, 3, where the word is so 
translated by Roberts. Customs had changed greatly by the 
third century of our era, and the articles mentioned might 
very well be in a kitchen of that time. 

The ordinary word for "kitchen," however, appears to have 
been oindviov, which Pollux [Onom. vi, 13, and i, 80) equates 
with fiayeipelov. We may compare on the usage of this word, 
fragments of Nicomachus (M. IV, 583; K. Ill, 386; vs. 25), 
Alexis (M. Ill, 464; K. II, 361; vs. 13), and Philemon 
(M. IV, 18; K. II, 493). In a fragment of Hegesippus 
(M. IV, 479; K. Ill, 312) such an oindvLov is compared by 
a fidyeipofi to the abode of the Sirens, past which none could 
go in safety (vss. 19 ff.). 

Finally, may be mentioned the word e^doironXLov used by 
Posidippus, according to Athenaeus (iii, 94c) , of a place 
where cooked meats were sold. But we have no knowledge 
of a fidy€ipo<i presiding over it. 

iCf. Bekker (GrOll), Charikles, II, 207, where it is suggested that the two were 
different, but satisfactory proofs are not adduced. 

2Aa regards the word itself, compare Lobeck, Phryn. 276; Rutherford, New 
Phryn. 341 ; Herodian., i, 375, 27 (Lentz), etc. ; Thorn. Mag. 236, U; Cramer, Anecd. II, 
p. 308, 1. 28. Other passages are cited by Lobeck. 



CHAPTER VI 

STATE SUPERVISION OP THE MArEIPOI 

From a fragment of Menander (M. IV, 147; K. Ill, 78) 
we learn that the fidjeipoi were required to register with cer- 
tain officials called TvvaiKouofioi^ This was doubtless done 
in order that the officials might ascertain from the fidyeipot 
the number of guests invited to the entertainments at which 
the latter served, and might gain other information about 
matters over which these public officials had supervision at 
marriages and similar festal occasions. Menander 's words 
on the subject are as follows: 

Ilapa Tois rwaiKOVo/i,ots 8k tovs iv toTs ya/xois 

Travras fxayupov^ Kara vo/aov Kaivav rwa, 
Iva TTVvddvcDVTai tovs KeKXrjfievovi iav 
irXeiovs Tts wv t^ecmv co-tiwv TV)(r), 
€\6o)V .... 

Athenaeus (vi, 245a) tells a story of a wedding-feast at 
which these officials were present and took the number of the 
invited guests. From this it appears that thirty was the 
number allowed. 

And so Porson [Miscell, p. 247) rightly explains'' a pas- 
sage from Baton (M. IV, 501; K. Ill, 327) in which a 
fidyeipof says: 

Ev y', 0) %L^vvrf, tois viicTas ov Ka$€v8ofi€v, 
ov8' avay€ypdfjLfi€$' , aXXa Kaerai X.v^o<i, etc. 

1 From Aristotle. Pol. 4, 15 (1299a, 22; 1300a, 4), it is seen that these were regular 
officials in his time. Cf. Casaubon, Animadv. in Athen., p. 271. 

2 " Nomina nostra non publicis tabulis in foro at similibus locis inscripta sunti 
sicut aliorum coquorum," is Person's explanation of vs. 2. 

46 



state Supervision of the Mdyeipoi 47 

This fidy€ipo<; and his friends in the profession were not yet 
registered with the officials, perhaps because they had not 
passed the state of apprenticeship in the art, since they were 
still studying the masters. 

Nicomachus also appears to me to refer to the register 
kept of fidyeipoi, and even to a record of their standing in the 
profession. In this fragment (M. IV, 583; K. Ill, 386) a 
fidyeipot speaks as follows (vss. 1-5) : 

"YTToSeiKvuets /i.«v ^^os doretov irdw 
Kol irpaoVf oXiyotpov 8k TrcTrotr^Kas ti. B. Hoi?;

rj TrpoTcpov lirvOov twv d/cpi/Sois tlhoTtav 
ovTiii t' ifx.icr6u>(T<a /ac; B. fxa At' cyu) fikv ov. 

The words twv uKpi^m elSorcov apparently refer to these offi- 
cials, who kept a record of fidyetpoi and their attainments in 
the art. The fidy€ipo<i here expresses his contempt (vss. 6 ff.) 
for an employer who does not know that there are various 
degrees of excellency of accomplishments among members 
of his profession. 

It is very evident, therefore, that the officials mentioned 
above had a certain superintendence and jurisdiction over 
the professional fidyeipot, and an employer would do well to 
consult them before deciding upon the merits of the various 
fidyeipoi whom he might encounter in the market-place when 
in search of the services of one of their number. 



CHAPTER VII 
OCCASIONS FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF MArEIPOI 

I 

(a) At dinners, banquets, etc. — Professional fidyeipoi were 
naturally often employed for the preparation of feasts and 
great dinners and the like. The ordinary house slaves up 
to Alexandrian times were not able to meet the requirements 
of the occasion. And so we have already seen (p. 43) in a 
fragment of Alexis (M, III, 501; K. II, 391) how a fid<yetpo<; 
was hired in the Ceramus ek karCacnv. In a long fragment 
of Mnesimachus (M. Ill, 568; K. 11,437) we likewise have 
an account of a banquet of immense proportions to which 
the invited guests have failed to come at the appointed time. 
The host accordingly sends word to them that the fidyeipof 
should not be thus treated (vss. 25 ff.) : 

Hkciv ^Srj Koi fii] /uieWeiv 
Tw TC fiayupto ftiq XvjMiLViaO', 
a)s tS)v oij/oiv €<f>6wv ovTtiiv, etc. 

And even in later times the feast described by Matron in his 
'Attikov AeiTTvov (in Ath. iv, 134d) was marked by the con- 
spicuous presence of the fidyeipot. Compare vss. 11, 46, 96. 
But at the great state festivals the services of the fidyeipoi 
were especially in demand. A very good example of their 
being thus employed is found in the Acharnians of Aristo- 
phanes. It is the second day of the feast of the Anthesteria 
(vss, 1000-1002, where the herald speaks), and Dicaeopolis, 
the prominent rustic citizen, is giving his orders for the prep- 
aration of the feast. The chorus replies to his words as 
follows (vss. 1003-17):

Although the old man serves himself in this instance, he is 
nevertheless praised for doing it fiayeipiKm KOfiyjrm re Kai 
B€t7rvr)TLK(o<; ; so that we are warranted in the supposition that 
this was the most approved style at such a feast.' At the 
religious festivals of the Delians also, we learn from Athe- 
naeus (iv, 172/), the /xdyeipoL and TpaTre^oiroioC were fur- 
nished for such occasions.^ Among the Lacedaemonians, 
moreover, according to Molpis (in Ath. iv, 141 e) the fidyet- 
/)09 played an important part at certain feasts and announced 
the contributions made to the ^iBiria.^ 

For great dinners, too, among the Greeks professional 
fidyeipoL were hired. A p.dyeLpo'i who had rrelpav — TroXureXoii/ 
iroWatv re Seiirvcov, as mentioned by Dionysius (M. Ill, 547 ; 
K. II, 423; vss. 37 f.),* would consequently be much sought 
after. Such a master of the art would doubtless follow the 
independent course of action suggested by a fidyeipof in a

later.

*In this passage it is not necessary to refer these words of the ii.ayti.poi to one of 
the expected guests. It seems to me quite as likely that there may here be a contrast 
between the fiayeipot o iroAiTiKot and o exTdn-tot. The foreign nayeipos is perhaps expected 
to aid in the preparation of the feast. 



50 Role of Mdyeipoi in Ancient Greece 

fragment of Diphilus (M. IV, 394; K. II, 553), who here 
converses with a rpa7re^o7roi6<i and says (vss. 4-6):

In a fragment of Alexis (M. Ill, 465; K. II, 362) a fidyeipo<! 
censures the master of the house for not having provided 
articles necessary for the SeiTrvov. Babrius (42, Rutherford) 
mentions a ixdyeipot who was to prepare a helirvov — Xafiirpov. 
Such fidyeipoi would be hired by the young sports of the 
time, and a man like Alcibiades must have been a good mark 
for men of this calling, as a passage in Plutarch [Alcib. 
203 B) seems to indicate. The Spartans were surprised that 
he could endure their coarse fare at all. Indeed, the custom 
of employing fidyeipoL for these banquets was so in vogue as 
to call forth these words recorded by Diogenes Laertius 
(ii, 72) : 'OveiSt^ofievo^ irore on Bi/crjv e')(a>v i/xtcrOdxraTO p^ropa, 
"Kafc 7a/)," e(f>r], ^'orav helirvov £%<», fidyeipov fjnadovfiaiy 
Yet a fidyeipof had to look well to his reputation, as we may 
conclude from a fragment of Archedicus (M. IV, 435; K. 
Ill, 276), where a fidyeipo^ says (vss. 11, 12): 

'EXaSt'ov KOTvX.r}<i re TrapavaXwfievrj'i 
<re(TO)K ifioi rpLKkiva ttcvti^kovt' ttrws. 

His future success depended on his present ingenuity. 
Alexis (M. Ill, 389; K. II, 301) gives an account rendered 
by a fJt,dy€t.po<i for the articles of food used at a fish dinner. 

It was perhaps not uncommon for a /xayet/oo? to serve at a 
dinner got up by contributions, though some of their pro- 
fession exercised precaution about those to whom they hired 
in such cases, as we have already seen from a fragment of 
Diphilus (M. IV, 394; K. II, 553).^ Athenaeus (x, 420e) 

1 See p. 42 and n. 1. Compare the fragment of Euphron (M. IV, 486 ; K. Ill, 317) 
in which one of the masters in the art of the /uioyetpot is represented as distinguished 
because of his ways and means for those getting up dinners by contributions : "An-i

depicts the treatment of the /xdyeipof in his day by those who 
gave dinners in this manner: O/ Se vvv avvdyovrei iirl rh

KeKpdyaai, ^Xaa^rjixovat, rbv olvo')(oov^ top SidKovov, top fidyetpov. 
Certain proof of fidyeipoi being used for club dinners is dis- 
covered in a fragment of Euphron (M. IV, 49*2; K. Ill, 
322),^ Here a fidyeipoi warns his pupil against carrying his 
trickery to excess (vss. 1, 2) : 

"Orav cpavtcTTais,* Kapt'wv, Sioucov^s, 

ovK loTt Trai^€LV, ov8' a fiefiddrpcas irouiv.^ 

From a fragment of Antiphanes (M, III, 144; K. II, 
126) it would seem that fidyeipoi sometimes prepared the 
dpiarov also. But the evidence is too scanty to be relied 
upon to establish the point. 

The skilled fidyeipoi was not always careful about the 
place where he was employed, however, provided the pay was 
to be sufficient. So we read in Diphilus (M. IV, 394; K. 
II, 553) of a fidyeipof who is to go to a brothel where the 
Adonia is being celebrated, as these verses (38-41) show:* 

Ov Sk vvv (t' o.yto,

dyova' kraipa fxeO' erepwv nopvwv )(y8rjv 
crarrrbv dTroco^cis rov re koXttov dTTOTpi\iiiv. 

And again, Athenaeus quotes (xiii, 579e) from Machon 
concerning hetaerae, and we see that a certain Diphilus 
(vs. 5) was among the guests at the dinner of Gnathaena 

iSuch a tudyeipoi may be the one who laments his fate in Archedicas (M. IV, 436; 
K. Ill, 277). See Meineke's notes on this fragment. 

2Cf. Arist., Frgta. 408 (Hall and Geldart). 

3Meineke, following Casaubon's explanation of this passage, seems to me to be 
in error. The young /uioyetpos is not to practice his tricks on epavio-rai, exactly because 
they are good for their pay ; whereas he is to do his utmost to outwit the rich old 
fellow whose pay is nevertheless small. 

♦ Possibly a /na'yeipov was employed in a like place in the play of Ephippus from 
which a fragment (M. Ill, 338 ; K. II, 262) has been quoted above (p. 40). For Athenaeus 

(vii, 2866) says : 'Ei^iTrirof £' o ku^uSioitoio; iv ^lAvpaf SpdfiaTi. (eraipat 5' oi'O/u.a ^ <^iAvpa).

and took along a fidy€ipo<i (vs. 11) as part of his contribution 
to the Aphrodisia. This may be a picture of later times. 

(6) At marriages. — Among the Greeks, as with us today, 
a marriage was the occasion for great festivities. And at 
the feast which accompanied every notable marriage there 
was need in early times of the services of the professional 
fidyeipo^;.^ Athenaeus (xiv, 659(i) says they had charge of 
such feasts: 

OuScv ovv rjv TrapdSoiov ci Koi $vTiK^<i ^(rav efirreipoL oi TraXaiTepoi 
fJua.yf.ipoL' irpotaravTo yovv /cat ydfitov Kal 6vaLWv. 

We have already seen (pp. 46 f.) that fidyecpoi were required 
to register with the Gynaeconomoi, who had supervision 
over the number of guests at wedding-feasts. This was, 
partly at least, because these fidyeipot were usually employed 
at such times, and could therefore furnish desired informa- 
tion to the officials. An early proof of the hiring of fidyetpoi 
for weddings is found in the Aves of Aristophanes. The 
preparations for the feast begin with vss. 1579-90, but are 
interrupted by the arrival of the ambassadors from the gods. 
A fidyeipot is here represented as cooking the delicacies for 
the feast, as we see from vs. 1637: Mdyeipe, to KdTaxv<Tfia 
XPV 'J^oLelv yXvKv. Fortunate it was that a fidyeipof was pre- 
sent, for it turns out to be a wedding-feast in the end. 
Verses 1688-93 are to be noted in this connection:

iThe A)/inovpyos (17) was also employed at wedding feasts, but her functions dif- 
fered from those of the /na'yeipos. The results of my study of the material collected 
on this subject will be published later. Cf. Menander in Ath. iv, 172a (M. IV, 222; 
K. Ill, 148), where a scene in the culinary department at a marriage feast is probably 
portrayed. 



Occasions for the Employment of Mdyeipoi 53 

Posidippus also gives us a picture (M. IV, 521; K. Ill, 342) 
of /xdyeipoc hired for a convivium nuptiale. A fJidj€ipo<{ is 
here addressing his assistants, and thus describes the work 
that is before them (vss. 19-24) :

The wedding was to be a distinguished one, the /Majeipo'; 
was to do his full duty. In a fragment of Euphron (M. IV, 
492; K. Ill, 322), also, a fidyeipot gives directions to his 
pupil regarding his actions at various functions. The pupil 
is to accompany his master to make ready a marriage feast, 
and these are the directions given by the elder fidyeipoij (vss. 
9-16):

The familiarity of a fidyeipo'; with weddings is evinced in 
a fragment of Hegesippus (M. IV, 479; K. Ill, 312) by a 
comparison he uses (vss. 15-16) : 

ToiovTos ivhoOev Tl.% iv TiS <ru>fM.Tt 
8USpafi.€ yapya\i(T fib's «*)? 6vT<tiv ydfiwv. 

That fidyeipoi continued to have charge of nuptial feasts in 
the time of Artemidorus (the second century A. d.) is evident 
from a passage in his OneirocrUicon (III, 56 Hercher) : 



54 Rdle of Mdyeipoi in Ancient Greece

Tcs fiayeLpw )(pCiVTai. 

This passage furthermore goes to prove that even at this 
time there were professional fidyeipou as well as in earlier 
times. 

(c) At funerals. — At funeral feasts, too, the fidyeipo<! 
was in demand among the Greeks. A /xdyeipof of most 
perfect type, according to his own professions, narrates his 
experiences at such a feast in a fragment of Hegesippus 
(M. IV, 479; K. III. 312; vss. 10-16): 

To TTcpas croi \eyw

Another reference to a irepihetirvov in Comedy is made by 
Anaxippus (M. IV, 459; K. Ill, 296), where a fidyeipof in 
discussing the tastes of various classes of people says (vss. 
40-42) : 

\yapWrfKa, vs. 38]

Kal TO TrcpiSfiTri'ov tov /^lov Xap.Tr pov ttoiw. 

Here, however, the word TrepChuirvov is not used in a strictly 
literal sense, as Meineke has pointed out, but of a feast 
before death. I cannot agree, however, with Meineke in 
accepting Dobree's ingenious emendation, nor do I think it 
necessary to emend to such a reading as that proposed by 
Kock. The true explanation of the passage is nearer at 
hand if we keep as nearly as possible to the text as trans- 
mitted to us. The manifest joke in the passage is then with 



Occasions for the Employment of Mayeipoi 55 

reference to the reXoivrjf;, for, says the comic poet, whenever 
he is around there is likely to be a death as the result of his 
visit to somebody. For all such victims, therefore, the fid- 
yeipo'i says he prepares a funeral feast in advance in antici- 
pation of the fate they are sure to meet at the hands of 
the tax collector. But the function of the /Md<y€ipo<; at such 
a feast is none the less apparent on account of the joke. 

{(l) At sacrifices. — Abundant evidence is afforded us not 
only in Greek literature, but by inscriptions as well which 
shows that a chief function of the fidyeLpot was in connection 
with the performance of sacrifices, both private and public' 
Again let us notice a statement of Athenaeus (xiv, 659d) 
which has been previously quoted:

In another place (xiv, 660a) the same author quotes Clei- 
demus to show the honorable position to which fidyeipoi 
sometimes attained in this occupation:^ 

"On 8c (TCfivov ^v iy fiayeipiKr/ fiaOeiv eariv ck twv 'AO'qvrp'i Ki^pvKwv

iThe Sjiixiovpyoi, "confectionery woman," was also employed at certain eacri- 
fices where sacrificial cakes were used. Cf. Pollux iii, 41. 

2 This passage has been much discussed. Cf. Schwoighftuser, Animadv. in Ath. 
VII, 666 ff., where Casaubon's view is quoted; also note on Ath. vi, 234/., in Animadv. 
Ill, p. 357. The origin of the name Kerykes is there explained, and citations are 
given to Greek literature on the subject. See also Dittenberger in Hermes, XX (188.5), 
pp. 29 f . ; ToepfiFer, Att. Geneal., pp. 91 and 151 f. ; Petersen in Zeitschr.f. Altertto., 1853, 
p. 49. Compare Stengel, Gr. Kulttisalt., p. 46. — It is hardly to be doubted that these 
Kerykes were not the ordinary praecones, but sacrorum ministri, as noted by Casau- 
bon. But it is not my intention to discuss in this place the various relations of this 
class of officials. 



56 jRdle of Mdyeipoi in Ancient Greece 

And again Cleidemus is quoted by Athenaeus on the same 
subject in two other passages: 

X, 425e, KXci'St/jiaos 81 tovs fxaytipov^ Ki^/jvfcas <^r;(rt KaXetor^ai, 
and xiv, 660d, *Ev Sk tw Trpwro) rijs 'ArdtBos K-XtiSrjfxos (fivkov airo- 
<f>aLV€i fJLayetpwv i)^6vT<ov 8r)ixi.ovpyiKa.<i TLfids, ols /cai to ttA^^os evtpyeiv 
epyov r]v. 

From these passages it seems clear that the fidyetpoi were in 
early times connected in some way with the special class of 
Kerykes, who were among the chief functionaries of the Eleu- 
sinian Mysteries and performed such duties as are indi- 
cated above. The opinion of Dittenberger [loc. cit.) and 
Toepffer [loc. cit.) that these Kerykes had certain functions 
of /Jt^dyeipot in early times (as proved by citations of Athe- 
naeus from Homer) and hence the duties of the fidyeipoi in 
this capacity allied them with the Kerykes, as stated by 
Cleidemus, appears to me to be correct, ToepfiPer would fur- 
ther identify with these same fidyeipoi the Sairpoi mentioned 
by Porphyrio [De abstin. ii, 30) ; but his arguments are 
insufficient to my mind.^ At all events, we may safely con- 
clude that the iidyecpoi were in early times associated with 
the honorable class of the Kerykes in their duties as sacri- 
ficers for certain religious organizations. 

As early as the time of Euripides (485-405 b. c.) the 
/xdy€ipo<i was a familiar personage in this official capacity of 
sacrificer, as seen from a passage in the Cyclops (396-406) . 
Here the Cyclops is called (vs. 396) t« deoarvyel A.Xhov 
HayeCpm because of the killing of human victims at his hands. 
In this sense he is a fidyetpof AlSov. This function of the 
fMdy€ipo<; is made even more evident in a passage in the Pax 
of Aristophanes (948-1061), where we have a splendid illus- 

iCf. p. 23, n. 3. 

2Toepffer's arguments that this is so are based mainly on the fact that lexicog- 
raphers define Sotrpo? by tiayeipo^. But at a later time it is my purpose to show that 
SaiTpds was very rarely used after Homeric times, and therefore the lexicographers 
used the later and more familiar word to define Sairpoi. Petersen (Zeitschr. f. Altertw,, 
1853, p. 49) would also connect the /j-ayetpoi, with the Sairpoi. 



Occasions for the Employment of Mdyeipoc 57 

tration of a sacrificial scene. But two verses have direct 
bearing on the fidy€Lpo<i as sacrificer. In these verses ( 1017, 
1018) Trygaeus is thus addressed: Aa/3e rrjv fidxai'pav' eW* 
OTTCB? /xayeipiKm [ (T(f)d^€i<i rov olv. The proper way to per- 
form a sacrifice, therefore, was as the skilled fidyeipof would do. 
A striking example of a sacrifice by a fidyeipof; is found in 
a fragment of Menander, quoted by Athenaeus (xiv, 659 d) : 

AiOTrep Me'vavSpos cv KoAoxt rov Tois TcrpaSio-Tats Suuiovovfievov

This fidyeipoi; is plainly represented as employed at the fes- 
tival of Aphrodite Pandemus, aided by his assistants in the 
performance of the sacrifice. Another such fidyeipof seems 
to have been mentioned in Simonides (frg. 24, B*), accord- 
ing to Athenaeus (xiv, 659e) :

Athenaeus (xiv, 659/) further cites as proof of the skill 
of the fidyeipoi in sacrifices the letter of Olympias to her son 
Alexander :

Here we have a fid<y€ipo<;, then, who was skilled in all the 
ancestral sacrifices of the house and in those of other reli- 
gious rites as well. Among the Arcadians, moreover, fidyeipoi 
were provided, apparently for sacrifices, by the state on cer- 
tain occasions. Athenaeus (iv, 148/) is again our authority:

The passage in Herodotus (vi, 60) already cited (pp. 23 f.) 
doubtless refers to the fidyetpoi, in their official capacity, as 
observed by Stein. Plutarch (.De tuend. san., 128c) seems 
to make reference to such functionaries among the Lacedae- 
monians in this comparison:

Finally may be mentioned, in passing, two of Aesop's 
fables^ in which the ox and the sheep are represented as 
expressing their preference in favor of being sacrificed by 
the skilled fidyeipo^, if such must be their end. The follow- 
ing passages complete the list of references to fidyetpot in 
this capacity in Greek literature, so far as I have been able 
to discover them: Plut., Moral. 1102 B and 696 E; Artem., 
Oneirocrit. i, 61; Callim., Dem. (vi), 106, 107. 

But not only does Greek literature give proofs of the fact 
that fidyeipot, were commonly employed in public sacrifices, 
but there is abundant inscriptional evidence to show that 
fjbdyeipoi were thus occupied, in particular, in connection with 

1 Cf . Pollux X, 97, on such a-Kfvr), 

2 Cf . Aesop, 80 (Halm) ; Babrius, 51 (Rutherford).

certain religious organizations. Yet the duties of the fjudyei- 
/309 were doubtless not the same in every case. Sometimes 
he was perhaps the main sacrificer under the priest in charge. 
Again, he might be merely an assistant (especially where an 
dpxi'fJ''(iy€Lpo<i is mentioned), or might be employed simply to 
prepare the feast that followed the sacrifice. One of the 
oldest of such inscriptions in which a fidyeipo<i is mentioned 
is in Dittenberger, Sylloge inscr. Gr.,^ 140, where (1, 16) we 
find Twt fiayipai rpCa 'qfXKofieXia. This inscription is an 
account of moneys paid out for repairs to the temple at 
Delphi after an earthquake that occurred about the year 
373 B. c. Dittenberger thinks the fidyeipof; was here hired 
as cook for the vaoiroLoL In another inscription, of the last 
half of the third century or the beginning of the second cen- 
tury B. c. (Ditt., Syll."^ 615, 11 ff.), are specified the parts of 
the sacrifice which the fidy€ipo<; is to receive along with cer- 
tain other perquisites:

An Attic inscription of the fourth century B. c. (Ditt., SylV 
634, 11. 25 ff.; C. I. A. II, 1, 163, 26ff.) includes among the 
expenses relating to the Panathenaea those ek to fjbayeipiKov. 
This is probably for the feast after the sacrifices, however, 
as may be inferred from the mention of lepoiroLoC in the same 
inscription. An inscription fromTroezen (in B. C. H. XVII, 
1893, 120/) mentions a fidy€cpo<; and ZidKovo^, where the 
fjidyeipof may have simply prepared the feast following the 
sacrifice, as E. Legrand suggests. From Sparta comes an 
inscription (in B. C. H. IX, 1885, p. 513) that mentions a 
fidyeipo^ in connection with several other functionaries of a 
religious association. But the most comprehensive list of 
such religious officials and ministers is discovered in the 



60 Bole of Mdyeipot, in Ancient Greece 

inscription in Lebas-Foucart, Inscr. du PSloponndse,^o. 163a. 
In lines 31-33 of this inscription are mentioned an aproKoiro't 
and ixd<yeLpo^ who doubtless prepared the feast for the meet- 
ings of the association.' Mdyeipoi are also referred to in this 
connection in inscriptions from Tanagra [Inscr. Or. Sept 
1562); from Thebes'^ (Cauer, Delectus^ 356); from Anac- 
torium (C. I. G. II, add. 17936, 18 f.), together with hiaKovo^. 
apxotv6xov<i, etc.; from Corcyra (O. I. G. II, add. 1849c, 
6 ff.), along with vTn}pera<i and oivoxpo^. But by far the 
largest number from any one place are from Olympia. 
Compare the work of Curtius, Adler, and others on Olympia, 
Volume V, 62, 17, where an apxi/J'dyei,po<i is mentioned along 
with e'irLa7rovhop')(r}(nai, olvo'xpo'^, etc. f V, 64, 33, areyavofio^

/. G. Sept. Ill, 486, 16, and 487, 14. In /. G. Sicil 617, 9, 
occurs a mention of a fidyecpo'^ which Kaibel thinks refers to 
the sacred rites of Diana and Apollo. Two other inscriptions 
(Inscr. Gr. Insul II, 646a, 6, and 'E0. 'A/o^-, 1885, p. 197) 
seem to mention fidyeipoi connected with the worship of 
Aesculapius. The second of these (of the fifth century b. c.) 
is a dedicatory inscription to Aesculapius by a fidy€ipo<i who 
was evidently an official in the temple service. An. inscrip- 
tion discussed by F. Hiller in Mitth. d. Arch. Inst. XIX 

1 See discussion of the inscription by the editors. It may very well be that at 
this time (first century a. d.) the iidiyeipoi whs a manumitted slave and this fact may 
be indicated by the use of iK with the name of his former master.

(1894), pp. 42 ff., may mention a fidyeipo^ of similar occu- 
pation. And finally to be noted here is an inscription in 
Revue ArcMol. I (1874), p. 91, No. 1, where we find Apollo 
worshiped as Mayipuo';. This is explained by P. Foucart 
(B. a H. VII [1883], p. 513) as showing a connection with 
one of the gods of the Semitic pantheon. Dittenberger (in 
Hermes, XIII [1878], pp. 892 f.) discusses an inscription 
(found in Bulletino Napoletano, I, pp. 137 ff., Tafel V, 2) 
which, he concludes, shows a similar dedication by some 
temple or religious functionary under the appellation of 
a/)Ta/xo9. This is the only occurrence, as far as I know, of 
the word being used in this signification. 

As regards the employment of the fidy€ipQ<i in private 
sacrifices, there are quite enough allusions to this aspect of 
his professional duties to convince us that he was not seldom 
employed in this way. Indeed, in a fragment of Athenio 
(M. IV, 557; K. Ill, 369) a fidy€ipo<; claims in extravagant 
language that his ancestors in the art were responsible for 
sacrifices ever having been offered to the gods. A few verses 
give the full meaning of his words for our purpose.

These sacrifices in private performed by fidyeipoi were for 
the most part at the beginning of feasts or dinners which 
were prepared by professional fidyeipoi. As I have attempted 
to show in a preceding chapter, these fidyeipot could scarcely 
have been in the condition of ordinary slaves much before the 
middle of the third century b. c, and even then a fidy€ipo<i 
was not included in the familia of every household. Hence 
the statements of Petersen {loc. cit.) and Stengel [Gr. Kul- 
tusalt., p. 95) are to be thus modified and corrected. 

In an amusing fragment from Straton (M. IV, 545; K. 
Ill, 361) a fidy€ipo<; has been hired on the occasion of a 
dinner party and persists in using Homeric phrases to the 
discomfort and disgust of his employer. He is to make the 
sacrifice, and thus addresses the employer (vss. 19 ff,):

In a fragment of Posidippus (M. IV, 521; K. Ill, 342) a 
fidyeipo<i states he is to go to prepare a wedding-feast, and 
incidentally mentions the sacrifice (vs. 19) : 
Auxxovovfiev vvv ydfiovi' to dvpxi ^ov<i. 

A fragment of Alexis (M. Ill, 464; K. II, 361) shows also 
that a /jidy€ipo<i had assistants at such sacrifices (vss. 11 ff.):

Occasions for the Employment of Mar/eipot 63 

It was not uncommon for employers to feel that they were 
being thus sacrificed by the endless prating of a fidyeipcx: 
instead of the real victim to be slain, as appears also from 
Anaxippus (M. IV, 459; K, III, 296; vss. 22 f.) :

But fj-dyeipoi were also used for private sacrifices of other 
kinds, as is evident from a recently published fragment of 
Menander's HepiKetpofievr) [Oxyrhynchus Papyrus, CCXI, 
14 ff.) ,' Hete the slave of the soldier Polemon suggests that 
a sacrifice would be in order in view of his good fortune in 
securing his wife. Compare vss. 17 ff. :

And in vs. 49 Polemon invites Pataecus, father of Glycera, to 
join him in the sacrifice: 

If the fjidyeipo<i did not receive his due portion at all such 
sacrifices, he was likely to get it in some unlawful way, as 
depicted in a fragment of Euphron (M. IV, 486 ; K. Ill, 317). 
Here a fJidy€ipo<i is represented as having caused great con- 
sternation at a certain sacrifice by surreptitiously disposing

of necessary sacrificial parts of the victim, and thus requiring 
a new sacrifice to be made. 

From these numerous passages and inscriptions which I 
have quoted it is quite evident that from very early times 
professional fidjeLpoi were famous for their skill in the per- 
formance of sacrifices, and their services were sought by 
religious organizations as well as by private individuals on 
particular occasions. 

II. AS BUTCHER 

When the fid'yeipo'; was discussed in his capacity as sacri- 
ficer, the skill was noticed which was attributed to him in the 
slaying of victims.^ We should not be surprised, therefore, to 
find such words as dprafio<i, 8aiTp6<i, Kpe(07r(o\7)<i, KpecoSairrj^ 
defined in the lexicographers by the word fidyet.po<i.^ These 
words were used properly at various periods [Sacrpo':, for 
example, being a Homeric word) of those who performed the 
functions of a butcher. After Homeric times, surely, such 
butchers would have their booths in the market-place, as 
may be seen from a passage in Machon (in Ath. xiii, 579e, 
11. 43fP.): 

'Ettci irpoi^rf rots Ircaiv rj Fva^aiva koX

known term — yet there is good evidence in the literature 
itself that some fidyeipoi as such did have butchers' stalls in 
the market and sold meat there. In the Equites of Aristo- 
phanes the sausage-seller relates one of his experiences while 
a boy, telling how he filched some meat from the shop of a 
fidyetpo^. Compare vss. 417-20:

This passage evidently refers to the butcher's shop with 
the assistants (TratSe?) present. Again, in a fragment of 
Alexis (M. Ill, 422; K. II, 329; vss. 22 ff.) the means for 
display used by a courtesan are compared to those of a 
fidyeipof; in his butcher's shop:

The reference is to the display of meats for sale.' A certain 
allusion to a fidyetpof; as butcher is made by Machon (in 
Ath. vi, 243/.), where he tells a story concerning the para- 
site Chaerephon: 

'O Kaip€ft>S)v KpedSi w^uivti vore,

"yXvKV fi€v, TTpoa-UTTafievov Sk Xvirti TravTa;^." 

A butcher is a butcher the world over! Aesop (301, 
Halm) tells a story of two youths who in buying meat from 

iC£.Arist.,£g. 375-81. 



66 Role of Mdyeipot in Ancient Greece 

a /xdjeipof practiced such deceit as permitted of a moral 
being attached to the fable, Plato [Legg. viii, 849 D) 
designates a place for the trade of the fid<y€cpo<i. Dio Chry- 
sostom [Orat. iv, 66 M.) speaks of fxayeipot driving sheep 
away to sell them, doubtless in their butcher stalls.' In still 
later times Artemidorus [Oneirocrit. iii, 56 [187]) uses 
these words: 

Ot Sc iv ayopa fmyeipoi oi to, Kpia KaraKOTrTovTcs koI TriTrpacTKovTcs fiv-

KivSwois eict (TTj/iavTiKol Sia to tw Si^fxto 8uiv€fieiv tov toiovtov fxAyupov 
TO Kpia. 

I cannot go so far as Stengel (G^r. Kult.^, 94 f.) does, 
however, and say that a single passage of Artemidorus 
[Oneirocr. v, 2[253]), as is implied, indicates that the 
butcher treated every animal he slaughtered as if it were a 
sacrificial victim. In fact, no mention of a ixdyetpo'i is here 
made, and the slaying of a wife would naturally be thought 
of as that of a sacrificial victim. Under this simile the 
sacrifice of her honor is first mentioned. It is only the fur- 
ther details of such a sacrifice that are given in the sale of 
the parts of the sacrificial victim. Nothing more can be in- 
ferred from the passage, it seems to me. 

It is possible that we have accounts of fidyeipoi as butchers 
preserved in Oxyrh. Papyr. CVIII, verso 2, and Amherst 
Papyr. CXXVII, 2. 

Yet until later times, at least, the word /Mayeipof was not 
commonly applied, I think, to butchers who kept stalls in the 
market-place. Their skill in slaughtering animals was put 
to good use in preparing meat for great feasts and in making 
sacrifices. 

iThe comparison between the ndyeipof (whether as sacrificer or as butcher) and 
the noi.iiiijv is frequent in Greek literature. Compare Aesop, 377 (Halm); Max. Tyr., 
Dissert, xxv, 2; Themist., Or. xiii, nic," Synes., De regno, p. 4. 



CHAPTER VIII 

NUMBER OF MArEIPOI EMPLOYED 

The number of fidyeipoi hired for any given occasion 
varied according to the magnitude of the affair and the 
preparations that were necessary. Thus Antiphanes (M. Ill, 
132; K. II, 110) seems to have represented a large feast at 
which the services of twelve fidyecpot were required. The 
fact that Brjfiiovpyoi were hired for the same occasion may 
indicate that it was a grand nuptial feast.' And so other 
kinds of cooks might be hired along with the fidyeipoi. We 
have seen in a fragment of Alexis (M. Ill, 480; K. II, 375) 
that someone desired the services of two fidyetpoi: 

*Eya)'y€ 8vo Aa^tTv /xaycipous fiovXofuii 
ovs av (roc^oDTaTovs Sww/u.' ev rrj iroXei. 

And in the passage quoted from Euphron (M. IV, 492; 
K. Ill, 322) at least one assistant was to accompany the 
fidyeipof; (who there speaks) to the wedding. For it is an 
assured thing that /xdyeipoi. had their subordinates on all 
great occasions, as we see from a fragment of Damoxenus 
(M. IV, 530; K. Ill, 349; vss. 43 ff.):

This fidyeipo^i, then, simply directed the movements of his 
assistants. Another reference to their inroSidKovoi is found 
in Posidippus (M. IV, 521; K. Ill, 342; vs. 10), while Anti-

68 Rdle of Mdyeipoi in Ancient Greece 

phanes (M. Ill, 125; K. II, 105) gives us a scene of a fid- 
y€Lpo<i cooking fish with his 7rat9 (vs. 12) standing by to 
assist him.* In the passage in the Acharnians, moreover, 
already referred to (p. 48), I see proof of the fact that a 
fjidyeipofi at times had even a great many assistants whom he 
directed. As already observed, Dicaeopolis was said to act 
fiay€ipi,KQ)<i, and yet he simply directs those who are preparing 
the feast of good things. There may, indeed, be an intended 
jest here at the expense of the fidyeipoi. 

In later times, as was to be expected, fidyeipoi were more 
numerous and employed by the great and extravagant per- 
sons in immense crowds, if we may trust the accounts of later 
writers. Athenaeus (xii, 547^), for example, tells of a

certain Sybarite who had x^Xioi fidyeipot koI opvidevraC 
Certain kings had whole brigades of fidyeipoc^ olvoxdot, etc., 
we are told by Zosimus [Hist, iv, 28). In such cases there 
were doubtless dpxi'H'dyeipol with their assistant fidyeipoL.^

CHAPTER IX 

PRICE PAID THE MAFEIPOI 

We have already observed that fidyeipoi were hired for the 
occasions when their services were required. Despite the 
statement of Athenaeus (xiv, 6606), 'Avayeypairrai re ov- 
Safiov /jiayeipcp fiia66<i^ aWa KripvKL, which refers to the (id- 
yeipoL as associated with the KijpuKef, we have at least one in- 
scription where (Ditt., SylV 140, 16) the pay of the /idy€ipo<{ 
is mentioned: tml fiayipcot rpta ^fiico^eXia; and elsewhere the 
perquisites of the fidyeipot are specially mentioned.' That 
they agreed upon their pay before accepting an offer for 
business is evident from several passages in extant Greek 
literature. This fact is made especially patent in a fragment 
of Euphron (M. IV, 492; K. Ill, 322), where (vss. 6 ff.) 
we find these words spoken by a fidyeipoi himself: 

[Act. . y ] ^ ^ 

Orav /u,€v lX6ri<i cis roiovrov avp^CTov, 
Apofiiova Kal KcpSojva Kal '^tuTrjplhnrfV,

civai SiKaiov, ov 8k vvv jSaSt'^o/xev, 
CIS Tor? ydfiov;, avSpo<f>6vov. 

We may compare also a fragment of Philostephanus 
(M. IV, 589; K. Ill, 393; vs. 4), Aois yaadhv bv /*' yr'naa'i 
rjKO) Bevp' dycovy which doubtless brought a smile to the face 
of the fidyeipoi to whom these words were addressed. In the 
Antiphanes passage (M. Ill, 132; K. II, 110) the fidyeipoi 
receive their pay in money, while Brjfiiovpyol demanded an- 
other kind, /LieXiTO? — aKd<f)a<t. But it was not always an easy 
matter for them to obtain the promised pay. A fidyeipoi 

1 See references under Chapter VII, I (d). 

69 



70 Rdle of Mar/eipot in Ancient Greece 

relates an experience of this nature in a fragment of Diphilus 
(M. IV, 394; K. II, 553), where he is speaking of certain 
persons whom he now avoids. His reasons are just ones 
(vss. 34 fe.): 

To fiiaOdpiov yap av awaiTr}^, a/xcSa /xoi 
HveyKe irpwrov, (l>r)(riv. o^os ^ <f}cu<rj

TT/oaJTOs fjuxyetpwy, <j>7)(Tiv. erepa fjuvpta 
TOixLVTa KaTaXe$aifi' av. 

The fidyeipo^i is hardly to be censured for declining to 
serve this class of employers. And, again, the pay was some- 
times small, as seen from Euphron (M. IV, 492; K. Ill, 322; 
vs. 13) : o fxiado<i fiiKpo'i. But it is also apparent that the 
fid<yeLpo<i exercised his full prerogative (as he considered it) 
at such times. And so in a fragment of Straton (M. IV, 545 ; 
K. Ill, 361) a fidyeipof persists in speaking in Homeric 
fashion, to the discomfiture of his employer, and is made to 
reply (vss. 32 f.) : 

" 'AAAa Sia Tas rerrapa^ 
SpaxP-OLi dTTo/JoAcD," <l>rja-i, "ttjv irpoaLpea-iv;" 

But it would be unsafe to draw any inferences from such 
a comic passage as to the real pay that a /xdyeipof might re- 
ceive at a given time. At this dinner several persons (more 
than five, vss. 13 f.) were to be present, but it was, possibly, 
to be in the country (cf. vs. 25). It is wise to make no 
deductions from the passage further than that the fidyeipo^ 
had his own way and expected to receive what, to his mind 
at least, was small pay for such an artist. We may also 
mention a fictitious account in Diogenes Laertius (vi, 86), 
where ten minae are put down to the credit of the fidyeipo<;. 
But the value of money fluctuated then as today, so that we 
are certain only of the ability of the professional fidyeipof 
ordinarily to get full value in return for the services he 
rendered. 



CHAPTER X 

DRESS OF THE MArEIPOI 

In the discussion of the social status of the fidyetpoi a 
passage in Pollux (iv, 118 f.) was quoted (p. 18) which 
contained the following statement concerning the dress of 
the fidyetpoL in the New Comedy : rw Se /xayeipco BtirXij, dyvair- 
T09 t; eadr}<i. What is the reference, then, comprised in 
the word StTrXr)? Let us first turn to Comedy itself for an 
explanation. In a fragment of Hegesippus (M. IV, 479; 
K. Ill, 312) a fidy€ipo<i in his boast of having attained per- 
fection in the art gives this reason for his assertions (vss. 
6ff.): 

Ov yap iraptpyoxi €fx,aOov iv tTeaiv 8v<rlv 

l^wv Trepi^oi/x', dAA' aTravra tov J3lov 

^TjTWv Kara p-iprj tijv T€)(yqv e^i/Ta/ca, etc. 

When fidyeipot began the study of their art, then, it would 
seem that they at once donned the irepi^cofia of their pro- 
fession. That they continued to wear it we learn from a 
fragment of Alexis (M. Ill, 465; K. II, 362), where a /xa- 
764/009 complains that nothing is at hand with which to pre- 
pare the dinner, and concludes with these words (vss. 10 f.) : 

AuiKevrjs 8' eaTrjK' iyio 
t\iav fid)(aLpav, irpfXTert. 7rc/9ic^o)<rjU,£vos. 

He had his apron on and knife in hand all ready for the 
performance of his duties. And so Meineke (III, 186) 
rightly explains the verb •irepte^Madai in a fragment of Anax- 
andrides, I think, of the vepiXcofMi quale coquorum proprium 
erat. Then may not the SlttXtj, dyvavTO<: eadrjf; of the Pollux 
passage simply refer to the fact that fidyeipoi commonly 
appeared wearing this second, upper garment or apron ? 

71 



72 Role of Mdyeipoi in Ancient Greece 

Outside of Comedy, also, there is evidence that the irepi- 
^(Ofxa was regularly worn by the fidjeipoi. Plutarch {Reg. 
et imp. apophth. 182 D) tells the following story: 

ApLffToSrjfiov 8e twv <{>l\<j)v tivos €k fxayupov ytyovivai Sokovvtos,

Aoyot <rov," enrev, "<i> ApiorroSi^/xc, Trepi^wfjuiTo<s o^ovaiv " 

The 7re/3t'^a)/ia was, consequently, a recognized part of the 
habit of a /xdy€i,po<i .^ Finally may be mentioned the story 
from Hegesander'' (in Ath. viii, 340/) about the poet 
Antagoras and King Antigonus: 

AvTayopas /xtv 6 ttoii^t^s ovk cia tov TratSa dXc ti/'ai tov lx9vv, aXXa.

Trpd$ei<: avaypdxl/ai yoyypovi eij/ovTa;'" k.t.€. 

Even the poet had the distinctive Trepi^co/xa of the /AayeipiK 
when employed with the duties of that profession. 

I Cf. Plut., Praecept. ger. rep. 821 E, where we read that the virriptTai of Phalaris 

of Agrigentum wore yKavKiva wepiiioiiaTa. 

2{yf. Plut., Quaest. conv, 668 D. But Plutarch does not give the story as from 
Hegesander. 



CHAPTER XI 

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MArEIPOI 

Up to this point we have considered the fidyetpoi more 
particularly with reference to their social status and the 
occasions when their services were most likely to be in 
demand. Now let us turn to a more exact consideration of 
the fjbdyecpoi themselves and of those traits which mainly 
characterized them in the practice of their profession. In 
this way we shall be brought finally to a brief inspection of 
the art itself as practiced by them. We find the fidyeipoL 
most clearly and most fully depicted in the Greek Comedy, 
and it is from the comic poets, particularly of the Middle 
and New Comedy, that we shall again draw our chief 
information. 

In by far the largest number of comic fragments in which 
the fidyeipof is the principal character we discov&r that his 
chief individual trait may be designated by the Greek word, 
aXa^oveia.^ We are not surprised, therefore, at the admission 
made by a /xdyeipo^ concerning his art in a fragment of 
Posidippus (M. IV, 521; K. Ill, 342) that well illustrates 
this very common trait of the fidyetpoi. A p.dyetpo'i converses 
with his pupils (Ath. ix, 376e) and impresses upon them 
the following words of admonition (vss. 1-15): 

Ma^r/ra Acvkwv ot T€ crvySuiKovoi

The methods encouraged by such a teacher were not suffered 
to pass unheeded by his pupils, we may infer from such a 
passage as that of Athenio (M. IV, 557; K. Ill, 369), where 
a fJidy€tpo<i claims that reverence toward the gods is due to 
his art; in fact, that civilization arose from the /xayetpiKr} 
T€xvrj. The passage is most amusingly interesting as show- 
ing the tendency of the boastful talk of our fidyecpot. Verses 
1-38 are as follows:

Such extravagant claims on the part of the fidyecpoL are 
often met with in the comic fragments. Thus in one of 
Sosipater's fragments (M. IV, 482; K. Ill, 314) a fidyeipo^ 
claims that there are many impostors in the art, but that he 
himself is among the very few survivors of the lost art who 
preserve intact the teachings of the great Sicon. If we may 
trust his words, the art of the fidyeipo^ demanded a study of 
astrology (vss. 15, 25 if.) in order to know the times and 
seasons for certain foods, of architecture (vss. 16, 36 ff.) for 
the correct construction of the kitchen, of strategy (vss. 18, 
44 ff.) for the proper arrangement and distribution of every- 
thing within the province of the fidyeipoi. In a similar vein 
a fidyetpo^ in a fragment of Nicomachus (M. IV, 583; K. Ill, 
386) contends that, while one /xdj€ipo<i may differ greatly 
from another, the true fidyetpo^ must have a knowledge of 
astrology, geometry, medicine, and other arts, if he would 



76 Bdle of MdyetpoL in Ancient Greece 

be most successful in the practice of his own profession. 
Another most wise fidyeipo'i is heard from in a long fragment 
of Damoxenus (M. IV, 530; K. Ill, 349). This one asserts 
that he was under the instruction of the learned Epicurus — 
apparently a parody on the beliefs of the Epicureans, as 
commonly understood, in comparison with those of the 
Stoics (vss. 64 fF.). He recommends the study of the great 
masters in the art who teach the proper uses of foods in their 
seasons and the surest means of preventing sickness. This 
is one of those /xdyeipoi who claim that they never go into 
the kitchen, but give instructions to their subordinates. All 
things must harmonize beautifully, he says; else there will 
result general distress and confusion. In the fragment of 
Straton (M. IV, 545; K. Ill, 361) already referred to (p. 62) 
a fidyeipo^ insists upon displaying his knowledge of Homeric 
Greek to the positive discomfort of his employer, who is 
brought to the point of exclaiming (vss. 1-4) :'

Again, in Hegesippus (M. IV, 479; K. Ill, 312) a 
fidyeipo^ boasts that he has reached the summit of his art by 
a lifelong study, advancing step by step toward the goal of 
his ambition, as we learn from vss. 6 fiF. :

On such a passage as this one is in its entirety it is not 
strange that Athenaeus (vii, 290&) remarks: 'AXa^oviKov 
8' iarl irdv to twv fiayeipcov (f)vXov. 

1 Cf. Pbilemon in Ath. xiv, 6396, and Meineke's note (IV, 48) on the passage. 



Characteristics of the Mdyeipot 11 

And so in almost every passage of significance where a 
fidyecpof; speaks in Co'medy we are able to detect this boast- 
ful, this arrogant spirit so characteristic of him in word and 
act. Along with the physicians (cf. Ath. ix, 377/) of 
ancient times he appears to have been the aka^cov par excel- 
lence. But let us look beneath the comic dress and discover, 
if possible, the real condition (aside from the social status, 
already discussed) of these fidyetpoi. It must, of course, be 
borne in mind that in all the passages now to be adduced 
the characteristic already mentioned is recognizable to a 
greater or less degree; but of this we shall not particularly 
speak again, it being well understood that this was one of 
their prominent traits. 

Elsewhere (pp. 2 ff.) we have referred to the growth of the 
art of the fidyeipoi for various causes and the consequent 
increase of the literature on the subject. It should cause 
no surprise, then, that the fidyeipoi so frequently speak of 
their great masters in the art. With due regard to the 
comic effect intended, it nevertheless seems true that these 
fjbdyeipoi did consult the books of those who were considered 
authorities on their art. And we shall presently see how 
the individual /xdyeipoi had special dishes on which they 
prided themselves. But not only did the older fidyeipoi study 
the old masters' works, but they gave instruction themselves 
to the younger generation in the art. So in Euphron 
(M. IV, 486; K. Ill, 317) a fidyeipoi is portrayed as address- 
ing one of his pupils who has rapidly become proficient in 
the art. His first words are worthy of notice (vss. 1-4) : 

IIoAAtov fiadrjTuiv yevofievwv i/xoi, Auce,

ciTrei ycyovcjs fJidyeLpo<i €k t^s oikio.? 
€v ov\ o\oL<i Soca fiTjai, ttoKv vtutraroi. 

From this we may infer that the time spent as an apprentice 
was usually longer than that here designated. Yet some of 



78 Rdle of Mdyeipoi in Ancient Greece 

the older members of the profession did not believe the art 
could be acquired so quickly, as seen from Sosipater (M. IV, 
482; K. Ill, 314; vss. 6ff.): 

'Ettci fmyeipov av Xa/Sys ak-rjOtvov, 
CK TraiSos 6p6!i)<; cis to Trpayfi' clcrrjyfiivov

ttTravr' c«^e^s elSoO', erepov croi Tv^bv 
<f>avrj(r€Tai to Trpayfia. 

Another such fia/yetpo^ is depicted by Hegesippus (M. IV, 
479; K. Ill, 312). Dionysius (M. Ill, 551; K. II, 425) 
also portrays a fji,a.yei,po<; in conversation with his pupils, who 
gives timely warning of what is expected of each of them in 
the pursuit of their vocation. Philetaerus (M, III, 298; 
K. II, 284) refers to a certain fidyeipo^ who had more pupils 
than Stratonicus (cf. p. 32, n. 1), while in Euphron (M. IV, 
492 ; K. Ill, 322) a pupil speaks proudly of his teacher's skill. 
We may safely conclude, therefore, that these frequent refer- 
ences had their basis in reality. The older class of /xdyeipoi 
would naturally pride themselves on their knowledge of the 
great writers on the art. And their instruction, in turn, would 
be sought by younger members of the profession who came 
under their supervision and acted as their assistants until 
they were competent to take up their occupation alone. 

The rivalry between /xdyecpot when a desirable employer 
wished to hire one of their number is well demonstrated in 
a fragment of Posidippus (M. IV, 513; K. Ill, 335), where 
such an employer relates his experience on such an occasion :

The better fidyeipoi, at least, did not hire to any chance per-

of Diphilus (M. IV, 394; K. II, 553; vss. 4-32), in which a 
IJidy€ipo<i converses with a T/oaTre^oTrotoV, furnishes trustworthy

1 Some proverb is doubtless referred to in these last verses, but there seems to 
have been another meaning intended, also. The ixaxa-tpa was a very common utensil 
of the ftayeipoi, and they are represented on the comic stage as carrying one of these. 
The successful contestant might, therefore, pass through the ranks of brandished 
fiaxaipai and the nip Koyiav of his rivals. See Meineke's note on this verse.

It is doubtless true that the most independent of the 
fidyeipoL knew beforehand the condition of the persons to 
whom they hired, and were quite as well informed as to the 
employers as the latter were concerning the standing of 
individual fidyeipoc. 

But when a professional fidy€tpo<; had once been hired for 
some special occasion, he could generally be depended upon 
to put forth his best efforts to make the affair a success. He 
particularly desired to know in advance the character of the 
persons who were to be present at the feast he was to pre- 
pare. In this respect he especially differed from the 
oyfro'jroLo'i^ (most like the fjidyeipo<; in some points of the pro- 
fession), according to the statement of a ixdyecpo^ in a frag- 
ment of Dionysius (M. Ill, 547; K. II, 423) when dis- 
coursing on the art to his employer (vss. 1-35) :

The fidyetpo^ spared no pains, then, it would seem, to pro- 
cure the proper food for each occasion and to suit the tastes 
of the persons present. It was especially important that 
they should be apprised of the various tastes of men of dif- 
ferent nationalities, we read in a fragment of Diphilus (M. 
IV, 381; K. II, 545), where a (Mayeipo^ is introduced in con-

In a city like Athens, whither the tide of commerce brought 
representatives of many nationalities, it was of particular 
consequence that the tastes of various peoples should be 
considered. A fragment of Menander (M. IV, 205; K. Ill, 
132) makes this care of the fidyeipoi even more apparent. 
The ficyeipoi; is in conversation with his employer, who speaks 

first:

Anaxippus (M. IV, 459; K. Ill, 296) presents a fidyeipo^ who 
claims that he is careful to know the temperaments of the 
men whom he serves. He has separate dishes (vss. 28 ff.) 
for the philosophers, the lovers, the tax collectors, those of 
different ages. So thoroughly has he studied this branch of 
the art that he boasts (vss. 47 f.) : 

'iStov TO 'Trpoawirov yvtoa-ofi' ov ^ryrti <f)ayelv

Characteristics of the Mdyeipoi 83 

A fi>dr/€ipo<i gives similar advice to his pupils in a fragment 
of a play of Posidippus (M. IV. 521 ; K. Ill, 342 ; vss. 15 ff. ) : 

"Oircp ovv wredefirjv, T<a k€v<S ywpav StSov.

But not only were the tastes consulted with reference to 
the kinds of food, but also in regard to the temperature at 
which it was served. This is the tenor of the speech of a 
fidyeipo^ in a fragment of Sosipater (M. IV, 482; K. Ill, 
314; vss. 45-56):

And, again, in a fragment of Alexis (M. Ill, 464; K. II, 
361) a fidy€ipo<; inquires how he shall serve the food on a 
certain occasion — cold or warm or steaming hot — and inso- 
lently expresses his private opinion of one who would have 
all his food served at the same temperature. Athenaeus 
(viii, 354d) states that the fidyeipoi of his day were care- 
ful in all such matters also. And so these fidyeipoi must 
needs keep their own senses alert, that they may make no 
mistakes along this line, according to a statement in Machon 
(M. IV, 496; K. Ill, 325). 



84 JRdle of Mdjeipoi in Ancient Greece 

Nor do we want for accounts of the ingenuity displayed by 
fidyeipoi on particular occasions. Thus a story is told of a 
certain Soterides (in Euphron, M. IV, 494; K. Ill, 323) 
who deceived a king with his imitation of anchovies at a time 
when the king was unable to secure the real article. A 
fidyeipo'i also delights to relate (in Archedicus, M. IV, 435; 
K. Ill, 276) how he preserved his reputation, when in a 
diflficult position, by using olive oil to make a quick fire and 
sending in some of his relishes while he prepared the fish, 
so as not to seem to be behind time. And even when some 
mistake had been made in his department, the ingenuity of 
the fidyeipoi stood him in good stead. Witness the ingen- 
ious device of a fidyeipo<i as proposed in a fragment of a lost 
play of Alexis (M. Ill, 439; K. II, 341) to the one who has 
made some mistake in cooking. The latter is apparently the 
first spokesman in the following dialogue (vss. 1-17):

Another p.dyeLpo<i in Dionysius (M. Ill, 547; K. II, 423) 
tells how he remedies a mistake with ease and adroitness. 



Characteristics of the Mdyeipoi 85 

This facility of adapting himself to every occasion that 
may arise, a fidy€ipo<i in Alexis (M. Ill, 451; K. II, 351) 
claims, distinguishes him from the cn^o'iroio'i, who does not 
possess the same skill. Let us note verses 6-14 of this frag- 
ment:

Despite all their learning, however, we sometimes read 
(cf. Anaxippus in Ath. ix, 403e) of innovators who caused 
physical suffering to those unfortunate enough to test their 
concoctions. Yet, like the great Seuthes in Posidippus (M. 
IV, 523; K. Ill, 344), they were more often able to general 
their forces in battle array against the hosts of the attacking 
party. Euphron (M. IV, 487; K. Ill, 317) even depicts 
the case of an adept in the art of securing booty who alone 
had discovered a way rov — fir) ^aveiv Xvicov Bia Kevrjf.^ But 
prudence must be exercised by the /xdyeipoi in practicing 
such tricks, we are told by a /xdyeipof in another fragment of 
Euphron (M. IV, 492; K. Ill, 322).' If they are sure of 
receiving their stipulated wages, they must not exceed the 
bounds of their professional discretion in all such matters. 

When fidyeipoL did transgress the limits of their own prov- 
ince, there was trouble as the result. A noteworthy example 
is found in Menander (M. IV, 222; K. Ill, 148), where a 
fMdyeipo<i has caused general consternation and confusion by 
undertaking what rightfully belonged to the province of the

T/aaTre^oTTOto? and the 8r)/j,iovpy6<i. His officiousness receives 
its just rebuke. Athenaeus (ix, 3836) also speaks of the 
curiosity of the class of fidyeipoi, and in a passage which 
appears to have had its origin in Comedy (Themist., Or. 21, 
262c) the slanderous propensities of their profession are well 
depicted. 

And so we must conclude, I think, that the poets of the 
Middle and the New Comedy have given us a true picture of 
the personal characteristics of the fidyeipoL of those times, 
however much of what is mainly or purely comic they may 
have combined in the characterization. Not to refer again 
to their prevailing trait of undue boastfulness, they were 
characterized, therefore, by a proper pride in their art and 
all that pertained to it, and used independent methods in its 
advancement. With them r/ /jLajeipixr) re^vr} was of prime 
importance at all times and in all circumstances. 

This pride of the fidyeipoi in their art is especially exem- 
plified in the preparation of particular dishes. In very many 
passages in Athenaeus the recipes for particular kinds of 
food are given, but it has seemed not a useless task to note 
here how the /xdyeipoi of ancient Greek times were experts in 
preparing certain dishes for the table on which they chiefly 
prided themselves. An excellent example of this is found in 
a fragment of Philemon (M. IV, 26; K. II, 500), where a 
/jbdyeipof; expresses his delight at the skill he has shown in 
cooking a fish:

This well illustrates the naive joy which one of these profes- 
sional fidyeipoc might experience over his success in cooking 
a favorite dainty of the Athenians. 

Indeed, fish were such a favorite food with many of the 
Greeks that there is ample evidence of the skill displayed by 
fidyeipoi in their preparation for the table. Antiphanes 
(M. Ill, 130; K. II, 109) gives a list of fish which are 
apparently intended for the knife of the fidy€tpo<;. In a 
fragment of Alexis (M. Ill, 429; K. II, 335) a fjLdy€tpo<i 
relates his purchases at the fish -market in comic fashion, and 
boasts that he prepares the sauces and dressings for such as 
these in so elegant style (vss. 21 ff. ) &crT€ rov<i | Benrvoi>vTa<i ek 
rd XoTraSt' ifi^dXXetv iroiw | iviore rots 68oWa<? inrb Trj<i ri8ovfj<i. 
We read of the method of preparing dried herring in another 
fragment of the same author (M. Ill, 470; K. II, 366). In 
still a third fragment of Alexis (M. Ill, 442; K. II, 344) the 
saurus is a specialty of a certain fidyeipo'i. The pleasure which 



88 Rdle of Mdjeipot in Ancient Greece 

a Greek audience would take in the description of the prepara- 
tion of certain kinds of fish may be readily inferred from a 
fragment of Sotades (M. Ill, 585; K. II, 447). Here a 
ndr/€cpo<i narrates at length his methods of dressing and cook- 
ing the various fishes he has bought in the market. In fact, 
the entire art of the fidyeipo^ in this specialty is clearly dis- 
played in this fragment. In the first place, a careful selection 
of the fish must be made. Then the cleaning of the finny 
creatures and the fire used in cooking them were of importance. 
Nor could the different parts of the fishes be treated in the 
same way. The manner of cooking them was also to be con- 
sidered, as well as the spices and condiments used in dressing 
them for the table. When finally they were served, daintily 
arranged among herbs of different species and with the varie- 
ties of sauces employed for various fishes, they might be 
truly called dishes fit for kingly mouths.' 

Let us now turn to a consideration of a few of the other 
dishes much in favor among the Greeks. Squids have been 
mentioned in some of the fragments of Comedy already 
quoted. The preparation of the squid is described in Alexis 
(M. Ill, 416 ; K. II, 323) . We find a longer passage on the 
same topic from the same author (M. Ill, 471; K.II, 367):

Boeotian eels were especially a delicacy with the Greeks, 
and in Antiphanes (M. Ill, 125; K. II, 105) we have a de- 
scription of the cooking of an eel (vss. 1-7) : 

1 A large number of passages from Archestratas and other writers relating to 
the cooking of fish might be quoted from Athenaeus (cf. vii, 3106, 278a, 3036, 306a, 
321c, 325/), as well as other passages from Greek Comedy (cf. Anaxilas, M, III, 346, 
K. II, 269; Timocles, M. Ill, 591, K. II, 451) on the same subject.

Fragments of Eubulus (M. Ill, 222, 223', K. II, 176, 177) 
also contain references to the eel, while the conger eel is 
mentioned by Alexis (M. Ill, 466; K. II, 363). 

The fidy€ipo<; at the banquet depicted by Athenaeus de- 
scribes (ix, 381a-c) in detail with much pride the manner 
in which he has prepared the roast pig which he now serves 
up to them. 

The feast described by Mnesimachus (M. Ill, 568; K. 

II, 437) is perhaps a fair example of the extravagant luxuries 
of the table among the Greeks of later times. The varieties 

* of meats here mentioned would doubtless require a number 
of professional /xdjeLpoL for their preparation. 

Candaulus is a dish of which a fidyeipo^; boasts his knowl- 
edge in a fragment of Alexis (M. Ill, 462; K. II, 360; 
vss. 1-6) :

A fjidyeipo'; in Philemon (M. IV, 18; K. II, 493) claims that 
he alone can make the candaulus, while in Nicostratus (M 

III, 284; K. II, 224) we read of a tidyeipot who could not 
make black broth, but understood the art of making Oplov 
KoL KdvBavXov. He was evidently not a Spartan cook, since, 
as we have seen (Plut. Vit. Lye. 46 E; Inst. Lac. 236 F), 



90 Hole of Mdr/ecpoi in Ancient Greece 

the Spartans were noted for their black broth. The dish 
called dplov, on the other hand, was peculiarly Athenian, we 
learned from Dionysius (M. Ill, 547; K. II, 423). 

Royal pea-soup and caper-plant were the specialties of a 
fidy€ipo<i in Demetrius (M. IV, 539; K, III 357), while the 
cooking of lentils had been taught a fjudjeipo'; by a native, as 
represented in a passage from Antiphanes (M. Ill, 95; K. 
II, 82). 

Nicostratus (M. Ill, 281; K. II, 221) represents a fidyei- 
po<i famous for a dish called fiarrvr]. 

Other dishes described by fxdyeipoi at the banquet of the 
Deipnosophists are the pohovvria (Ath. ix, 403d), pohwvid 
(Ath. ix, 406a), ixvfxa (xiv, 662d). 

Some idea of the seasonings used may be got from a frag- 
ment of Alexis (M. Ill, 437; K. II, 343), while Diphilus 
(M. IV, 383; K. II, 546) represents a p-dyeipof: who is con- 
versant with the best of them. 

But even without further proof, such as has just been 
adduced, we might justly infer from a single fragment of 
Euphron (M. IV, 486; K. Ill, 317), already quoted, that 
each fidyeipo<i of any note among the Greeks had his own 
special dish in which he took particular pride and interest. 
Here (vss. 5-12) the accomplishments of the seven sages 
are enumerated, each of them having gained distinction by 
a different means in the practice of his art. In Athenaeus 
(xii, 521c) we even read of the discoveries of fjidyeipoi being 
protected by law against use by others than the inventors. 

This brief review of some of the dishes on which indi- 
vidual Greek fxdyetpoi, especially prided themselves may serve 
to furnish some idea of the extent to which rj fiayeipiKr) rexvij 
was carried among the people of this nation. Every true

taught by those of his profession in the past, but also in 
making some fresh contribution to the art. The menu card 



Characteristics of the Mdyeipoi 91 

(ypafifiaTeiBiov, Ath. ii, 49 d) of these ancient times must 
have contained repeatedly items of courses that would whet 
the curiosity as well as the appetites of the Greeks. 

We are not now surprised, therefore, at the claim of a 
/jidyeipo^ in Philemon Junior (M. IV, 68; K. II, 540), who 
contends for skill in the cooking of meats and concludes with 
these words (vss. 6-9): 

Mayeipos eoriv ovk eav i^wfvqpvcriv 
i\<i)V Tis «A.^y Koi fidxaipav irpos Tiva, 
ouS' av Tis CIS Tots A,07ra8as ix^s ^/"•/SaXy, 
dXX' ta-TL Ti9 <f>p6vri(n<i iv t<5 TrpdyfiaTi. 

And the same thought as is expressed in Dionysius (M. Ill, 
547; K. II, 423; vss. 33 ff.) recurs many times in the comic 
fragments : 

Avr^ 8' eavr^s icrri Sea-ironjs- eav 8' 

€v fikv (TV xpv^v ''"0 '^h(yvi '''^^ '^'* '^^xyv'* 

Kaipov 8' d7roAc<rj;5, Trapa-jroXioXtv rf nxyv- 

But we must recognize the existence of a distinct art of 
the ixdy€Lpo<i, particularly when we observe the many refer- 
ences to it in writers other than the comic poets. Plato and 
Aristotle evidently admit the existence of the art, as such, in 
their day, as may be seen from various passages.' It is note- 
worthy that Plato generally mentions this art in connection 
with the profession of the physician.^ In Gorgias, 500 B, 
we find this statement: Kal iriOrjv r&v fiev irepl ra? ^Bova<; 
rrjv fiayeipiKTjv ifnreipiav, aW' ov Te')(vr)V, tmv Be irepl to dyadov 
TTjv larpcKrjv rexvrjv. With this we may compare GorgiaSj 
491 A, where the fidyetpoi are spoken of along with the 
a/cvTOTOfioi as of not much influence in the state. When we 
remember, however, that in Plato's time this art was already 
beginning to play so important a role in the life of the

Greeks, we need not be surprised that a philosopher like 
Plato should not hold the art in any too great esteem. 

Hippocrates also recognizes this art [Peri Diaites i, 18) 
and Theophrastus [Char, xx, 8 and 9) is acquainted with 
fidyeipo^ €v to oyjrov crKevd^cov. In later writers, as one would 
expect, there are frequent references to the art of the fidycLpo'i, 
as we have already observed, for it came to be a decided 
factor in the Greek life after Alexandrian times. And so 
the words of Dio Chrysostom (Ixxi, 378 R.) are not unex- 
pected: 'AWd (f)r}cn Kal t&v rotovTotv €fjb7r€ipo<; elvai^ fiayeipi- 
Krj<i Se Kal olvo')^oia<i Kal Trj^ dXXr)<i d7rd(Tr]<; 8iaKovia<;, d (fiijcri 
Toifi ')(€ipova'i rol<i dja0ol<i SiaKOvelaOaiJ The evil effects of 
the practice of this art are enumerated by Hermogenes 
{Froleg. rhet, IV, 22, 10, Waltz). In Plutarch's time, as 
frequent references have shown, the art was still recognized. 
Compare De for tuna, 990: Kal irepl dprvaiv oyfrcov rjv fiayei- 
piKTjv ovofid^ofiev. 

It is quite unnecessary to refer to Athenaeus again, 
throughout whose book, as we now know, there are practically 
innumerable allusions to the art. 

And so we must conclude that for several centuries 
^ fiayetpiKr) rexvq not only held its own among the Greeks, 
but grew to such proportions as I have attempted to describe, 
particularly after the oriental influences began to assert 
themselves in the fifth century before our era.
