THE DlAMOKD COOK BOOK; 



OR 

THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER'S FRIEND. 

-« — m^ — e- 

The object of this little book is to be a guide to young and inexpe- 
xienced housekeepers. The receipts are all for plain, everyday dishes and 
most of them are in quantities small enough for a family of two or three, 
they have been in constant use by experienced Cooks for a number of years 
and are known to be correct. The youngest and most inexperienced Cook 
can succeed in preparing palatable and delicious dishes by following these 
rules, she need never dread a failure for she will not meet one if she is care- 
ful and accurate. 

The writer has long sympathised with the young wife who has a mother- 
in-law constantly held up before her as a pattern. It is not at all pleasant 
to spend all the morning in the kitchen over the hot fire trying to prepare 
a dish that will please the lord and master of the house, and then have him, 
after merely tasting, push the dish away and say: "I don't "see Mrs. X, 
why you can't cook better, nothing that you make tastes as mother's cook- 
ing used to taste." Mrs. X. ought to remind her husband that he could not 
expect her, a woman of only twenty years, to do as well as his mother who 
has been cooking for thirty years or more. Remember that practice makes 
perfect, if the husband will wait and be patient and tfie wife try and try 
again she will soon be just as good a cook as the mother-in-law. 

The writer wishes to give the inexperienced cook a few hints, they may 
be unnecessary with some and they may be of great assi? tance to others. 
In the first place always remember that poor economy is great folly, perfect 
waste, always then, have everything of the very best or go without. Do 
not plan your meals before you do your marketing and when you do the 
«(aMparketing look around a little to see what the Butcher may have. If he has a 
^roast of beef that is just the right size and cut for you take it, if he has not 
take something else that is just the cut for you. In buying your groceries 
always deal with an honest man, one, who you feel sure, will sell you the 
groceries just as puri as he can buy them himself. 

A copy of the Diamond Cook Book will be sent to any address by the 
publishers.

Soup Stock. 

Take three or four pounds of shank of 
beef, cut into small pieces, add all the bones 
and bits of cold meat you have in the house 
and cover the whole with cold water, let it 
stand for an hour or two and set on the 
stove, boil it several hours then strain and 
set away to cool. When it iscool the fat can 
be easily removed ; do not have a bit of fat 
in it. 

This is the soup stock and several different 
soups can be made by boiling the different 
vegetables, rice, macaroni or manicoa in 
water and adding some of the soup stock, 
and seasoning to taste. Whenever an onion 
is used it is much nicer grated than cut in 
pieces. 



A Mother's Experience. 



White Soup. 

Strain two or three small boiled potatoes 
through a wire strainer, mix with them two 
cups of water, one and one-half cup of milk 
and one-half cup of soup stock, if you have it. 
Season to taste with pepper, salt and ground 
celery seed. Let it boil up once and serve. 

Pea Soup. 

Pick over and wash one pint of split peas, 
cover with water and soak during the 
norning, three hours before dinner put 
them in a kettle with a quart more water 
and a small piece of salt pork, boil steadily, 
stirriag often lest it should burn. If you 
prefer to have the soup without pork use 
the liquor that fresh beef or other meat has 
been boiled in instead of water and use no 
pork. It may need more water as it boils, 
you can make it of whatever thickness you 
prefer. 

Oyster Scallop. 

Butter a deep baking dish, line it with 
bread or cracker crumbs, wet the crumbs 
with the oyster liquor and milk. Next pi?t 
in a layer of oysters and sprinkle with salt, 
pepper and little bits of butter. Then 
another layer of moistened crumbs, and so 
on until the dish is full. Let the top layer 
be crumbs with bits of butter scattered over 
them. Bake about half an houi. 



I have decided to write an accurate account 
of my experience with a bottle baby, think- 
ing that it may be of some use to mothers 
who are obliged to bring their babies up "by 
hand," as our grandmothers used to say, amltt 
hoping it will show them how foolish it is to 
persist in following a whim contrary to the 
advise of older and more experienced people. 
When my baby was three weeks old I 
found I was unable to nurse her and it was 
difficult for me to decide what to give her. 
My physician wished me to try some of these 
foods that we hear so much about now- a days, 
I objected to them as I have always disliked 
the idea of feeding anything to a baby that 
I have not prepared myself. I now see how 
silly I was to have that idea. Cow's milk 
seemed, according to my way of thinking, 
the next best thing to mother's milk for I 
could tell whether that was clean or not. 
What a mistaken idea that was I I thought 
my milk-man was neat and tidy • but, to my 
sorrow, I found that he was not. I thought 
that milk-man number two was honest;<|HL 
when he came so near beinr ^he causeof 
ending poor Baby's life, I con u"ed that few 
men are to be depended upon en if they 
have a reputation for honesty as ... '<-man 
number two had. 

I decided to bring Baby up on cow's milk 
in spite of all Dr. James said against it. He 
said that in the country where the milk could 
be brought right into the house, strained and 
set away, it was doubtless the best thing for 
most children ; but here in the city, when 
we are at the mercy of the milk men and 
never know what we are getting, milk is not 
to be desired as a food for infants, especially 
after it has been churned up in the cans 
during the three or four hours ride that it 
has before it is delivered to us. In spite of 
all he said I made up my mind that milk was 
the best, so I bought two milk cans, gave 
them to the man asking him to bring me milk 
from one good healthy cow. He was to leave 
the can of milk in the morning and take the 
other can with him to fill the next day, in 
that way we knew that the cans were per- 
fectly clean and sweet for we cleaned them 
ourselves. All went weU for two weeks,

there is plenty of time for the meat to cook. 
Novvriu the meat from the bone, remove 
all b.iil parts and put the meat in a frying- 
pan w th some of the water in which it was 
cooked and a piece of butter if there was no 
fat m the meat, set it on the stove and allow 
it to l.ruwn until the meat is crisp on the 
ont^iile, then turn in the rest of the water 
from the kettle and thicken with flour wet 
with cold water. ITiis dish can be varied 
by cooking rice, potatoes, macaroni, pars- 
nil'S and onions in a little w.iter and adding 
to the stew. Some of this meat, before it 
has been browned, will make a nice pie ac- 
cording to 'ae following directions: 

Meat Pie. 

2 cups flour. 

2 teaspoonfu.s baking powder, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter or lard. 

Milk or C"ld water. 

Sift the flour and baking powder together 
work in the butter with a spoon, if lard is 
used a little salt will be needed. Use enough 
of the milk or witer to make a dough stiff 
enough to roll out. Line a buttered baking 
dish with part of this dough rolled into a 
thin sheet, fill it with the meat cut into 
small pieces, pour over it a cup of the 
thickened gravy and put on the top crust. 
Kftke half an hour in a quick oven. 

Boast Pork. 

Cut off the skin and part of the fat if there 
is a good deal. Have the oven very hot 
when the pork is first put in, cook it fifteen 
or twenty minutes, then pour over it a cup 
of boiling water, and sprinkle with sage, 
pepper and salt, baste frequently. Cook 
the ])ork a long time, the more it is cooked 
the better it will be and the more healthy. 
Do not make a gravy it is too greasy to be 
good. 

Yorkshire Pork Pie. 

Make a crust according to the rule for 
meat pie. Line a buttered dish with part 
of the crust, fill it with alternate layers of 
cold pork, sliced thin and seasoned with 
sage, pepper and salt, and some apples 

f>ared and cut in thin slices. Pour in a 
ittle warm water or beef gravy, put on the 
tO|} crust and b»ke 



after she drank it she was crying as though 
she was in terrible pain, and (iiially relieved 
herself by vomiting. I persisted in giving 
it to her for two or three days, for I felt 
that it was the last resort, it was all to no 
puriK)se though, for she could not eat it and 
live. 

Finally in a fit of desperation I went to 
Dr. James and asked him wiuit *o do, •• I 
have found that the milk-men cannot be 
trusted; Baby cannot eat barley w;„cer or 
condensed milk ; what shall I do?" I said. 
I do believe, he was glad, I imagined there 
was a twinkle in his eyes and the corners of 
his mouth twitched as thoi;gh he wanted to 
laugh at me and say "I told you so,'' he was 
polite enough not to say anything of that 
kind however ; but said he could only advise 
me as he did l)efore When I told him why 
I objected to the manufactured foods, he did 
laugh, and asked if I ate anything myself, 
said I ought to visit some of the flour mills 
and some of the bakeries. He seemed to 
think it very inconsistent of me to eat sugar, 
candies, baker's cakes, anything made of 
flour, or anyth-ng at all, thinking that ifl||L 
clean and sweet and then think all onR 
prepared foods for infants and invalids were 
unfit to use because of the carelessness oft he 
manufacturers- 

"He concluded by saying "Mrs. F. you 
must do as you like in this one thing, I can 
only tell you what I think and what I know, 
1 th;..k Wells, Richardson &' Co's Lactated 
Food will agree with your baby, that she 
will do well if she has it. I know that it is 
a perfect food, that it is prepared according 
to this formula, "~he read it to me, I don't 
rememberit-"that it is perfectly clcan.much 
cleaner than the flour and other things you 
are using all the time. If you do not feel 
quite sure I am telling you the trut' , I will 
go with you down to the factory ana let you 
see for yourself, I know the firm well, they 
will be glad to show you all over the place, 
let you pry into all the corners and «.sk all 
questions you wish." 

I went with the Doctor, and was sur- 
prised and delighted to see how nice and neat 
it all was, it could not have been nicer had 
it been in my own kitchen under my own 
supervisioa, Before I had been in the &c-

Dried Beof. 

Chip the dried beef into thin slices, cut 
these slices into small bits and put in a fry. 
ing piin with enough milk to cover the bits 
of meat, a small lump of butterand a little 
pepper. Thicken this when it is boiling 
hot '.vith one teaspoonful of cornstarch wet 
with a little cold milk. When it boils up 
once more stir in an egg well beaten. As it 
IS often difTiLult to get the genuine dried 
beef it is better to dry it yourself, then you 
are sire of it wnen yau want <t. This can 
easily be done by cutting out a part of the 
lean meat from the piece of corn beef that 
you have bought from your butcher and 
hanging it over the stove covered lightly 
with brown paper or a cloth. From one to 
two weeks will be sufTicient to dry a small 
piece of meat if there is a constant fire. 

Below are given the directions for curing 
and drying the beef, for the benefit of those 
who may wish to try it, you will surely feel 
that you have been repaid for your trouble 
for when dried in this way it is delicious. 
M^ To Dry Beef. 

ror twelve pounds of beef heat and rub 
in one- half cup of salt once a week for four 
weeks, the fourth time put a little brown 
sugar and saltpetre with the salt. Keep 
the meat in a dish covered with a cloth 
during the time of salting and for a few 
days after the fourth salting, then hang in 
A cold place where it will freeze until it is 
frozen dry. 

Beef Croquettes. 

Chop the bits of cold beef very fine, to 
one cupful of chopped meat add one-half 
cup of cracker crumbs, one egg, mustard, 
ground celery seed, pepper and salt and mix 
together, a little hot water or meat gravy 
may be needed to make the crumbs stick 
together. Make into little cakes and fry 
in a hot buttered pan. 

Roast NTeal 

Remove the bones from the meat and fill 
the cavity with a dressing made of two cups 
of bread crumbs, one-half cup of chopped 
pork, seasoned with lemon juice, sage and 
pepper. Follow the directioi for roasting 
beef allowing more time as vcuL needs to be 
well cooked. 



tory two minutes I was quite convinced that 
I had alw— ' '^ad very silly ideas about man- 
ufactured foods, and was ready to try Lac- 
tated Food. I very gladly accepted the 
sample package they offered me and prepared 
some as soon as I returned home, I found 
that It made a very palatable dish indeed 

Baby did not like it at first, but I perse- 
verecl in giving it to her. She soon fo md 
that It Wtis nice and is now altogether too 
eager for it, she wants more than sheoui'hl 
to have. ** 

Now I think Baby's troubles are over, we 
have used the food f < r two mouths. Uaby 
Ikes It and she is growing fast, she has n./t 
been sick one day since we commenced giv- 
ing It to lier and best of all she sleeps wel 1 
When once she is asleep nothing will waken 
her until she has had her sleep out. 

At first I had a great deal of trouble with 
the -bottles, in spite of all my cleaning they 
wouid get sour occasionally. I have three 
bottles, each one is complete with its glass 
and rubber tubes and nipples , Twice every 
day, morning and evening, I give them a 
thorough washing in warm soap suds, using

ing in cold water, as soon as one has been 
used I empty, wash and fill it with cold water 
occasionally I wash them in soda water.' 
iNow tkat I am using Lactated Food I find 
that there is no danger of the bottles getting 
sour as the Food always seems to be sweet; 
but while I was using milk I was always 
womed least the bottles would get sour and 
that would, of course, make Baby sick. 

Baby seems to be well now, siie is grow- 
ing fast, and is the most contented child I 
have ever seen. I have commenced, very 
foolishly I suppose, to dread the summer, 
and the time she will be cu ting her teeth, 
still if Dr. James tells metlie truth she will 
get through nicely unless something unusual 
happens. Dr. James says all the children 
he has given this food to, have outlived all 
their troubles. He believes tliere is little 
danger of Cholera Infantum if nothing but 
Lactated Food is given and that children will 
pass the teething time nicely if they have 
this Food and nothing else. 

After Baby had been taking the Food for 
a few d^ys and we saw tiut slic was ccalJy

Veal Scallop. 

Chop the pieces of cold veal and put the 
chopped meat in u buttered baking dish, 
in altprnate layers with cracker cruiiil>5, the 
same as in the oyster scallop. Pour a cup 
of the gravy over the whole and bake half 
an hour. 

Deviled Ham. 

Chop lean, boiled ham »ery fine. To 
every pint of ham add one teaspoonful of 
mustard, one tablespoonful of flour, and 
one-half cup of boiling water. Press this 
mixture in a mould, when it is cold it will 
slice nicely. It is excellent for sandwiches. 

Oreaxned Eggs and Baoon. 

Boil three eggs hard and cut them in 
slices. Arrange on a platter and pour over 
iihem a cream sauce made by stirring a tea- 
spoonful of butter rolled in one of com- 
starch into a cupful of boiling milk and 
cooking until it thickens, seasoning to suit 
the taste. ArraJiee thin slices of bacon fried 
crisD around thg edge of the platter. 

Spioed Meat. 
Take a thin slice of round steak remove 
the bone, all the fat, and the bits of skinny 
membrane on the outside. Make a dress- 
ing of one cup of bread crumbs, one-half 
cup of butter, mustard, pepper, salt, ground 
celery seed and spices to suit the taste, add 
enough hot water to make it soft and 
spread over the meat. Now roll it up 
firmly and tie in a thin cloth, place the roll 
in a kettle and cover with boiling water. 
Boil from three to five hours according to 
the size of the roll. After it has boiled two 
hours put in a teaspoonful of salt. When it 
is done remove the cloth, place the meat in 
a mould with a heavy weight on top. When 
it is cold it will slice nicely and makes a nice 
cold meat for lunch or supper. 

Ohiokeu Salad. 
Boil the chicken till very tender, free it 
from bones and gristle, and chop. Chop a 
good sized head of celery and mix with the 
chicken, season to taste with pepper and 
salt. Tvlake a dressing by beating the yolk 
of one egg until light, add one-half tea- 
spoonful mustard, one-half teaspoonful 



improving and I had ceased worrying I found 
that the constant worry sil)out Ikt had Iklv 
too much forme, I was all worn out, my 
nervoussystem war completely unstrung and 
my old friend, Dyspepsia returned. I nrver 
felt so perfectly miserable in all my life, I 
ftlt that I was nocomfort or blesssin^r to my 
family and I certainly was not to niyW'lf. 

I took all of the tonics that 1 )r. James re- 
commended, all of the tonics and nerve foods 
lliat all of my neighbors had ever heard of', 
1 at it was all useless, not one of the tonics 
(lid nie a particle of good. I was disi r- 
aged, I did not know what to do. Onedaj' 
I was looking over the newspapers and no- 
ticed that Wells, Richardson tSr* Co., were 
advertising a new preparation of thei rs called 
Paine's Celery Conii>ound, they recommend 
it for nervous dyspeptics. 'There," 1 snid, 
" I will try that, the food they make is the 
belt there is and if they can make one good 
thing tuey certainly ought tomakr another." 
I did try it and from the very first a felt that 
I was being benditfed by it. After takiug 
a few bottles I feel perfectly well and strong, 
never was better in my life ; I enjoy living 
once more and can care for my Family as I 
ought. And now I would r-commend all 
young mothers to follow the advice of their 
physicians, for the physicians have had more 
experience and ar« l)etter able to judge of 
the nourishing qualities of the foods and 
milk, by so doing they will escape the trouble 
and anxiety through which I passed.

How to Prepare the Food for Yonng 
or Delicate Children. 

Take three teaspoonfuls of Food, and 
mix to the consistency of cream with a 
little cold water. Add one half pint of 
warm water, and heat until it boils, stirring 
constantly; remove from the fire and add 
one fourth pint of pure milk. As the Food 
contains sufficient Sugar of Milk to make 
It of the same degree of sweetness as 
mother's milk, we do not recommend the 
use of any cane sugar. In some cases, how- 
ever, if children have been used to other 
loods, that have been sweetened, it may be 
necessary to add a small amount in order 
to satisfy them. In case this is necessary, 
use as little as possible, and gradually dis- 
continue it until left out entirely, for it is 
liable to produce sour stomach. In some 
cases of very feeble digestive powers it 
may be necessary to use somewhat less 
milk. 

For Stronger and Older Children. 

Make as above, but use one-half pint of 
milk with a half pint of cooked food. 

General Directions. 

The above directions will meet almost 
every condition, but there may be cases 
that will need to vary somewhat from the 
rules given. An observing nurse will soon 
be able to adapt the Food to the wants of 
either the infant or the invalid. 

In the case of infants, the feeding for the 

hrst month should be moderate ; notoftener 

than every two hours when awake, and not 

to exceed at any time about three ounces, 

which IS an ordinary nursing bottle half 

lull. In some cases the child cannot take 

as much as this. The first month of the 

child s existence is spent mostly in sleep, 

and It should never be awakened for the 

purpose of feeding. When food is neces- 

sary, the rhild will waken. As the chile'

Baked Macaroni. 

Cook the macaroni in salted water for 
twenty or thirty minutes. It should be soft 
but not split. Drain well and put a layer 
in the bottom of a buttered pudding dish ; 
upon this grate some mild rich cheese and 
scatter over it some bits of butter. Spread 
upon the cheese more macaroni ; fill th« 
dish in this order, having macaroni at the 
top covered with bread or cracker crumbs 
and bits of butter scattered over it. Add 
a little milk and bake, covered, for a half 
hcur, then brown and serve in the bake 
dibh. 

Creamed Macaroni. 

Cook the macaroni ten minutes in boiling, 
salted water. Drain this ofl and add a 
cupful of milk, stew until the macaroni is 
tender. In another saucepan heat a cup of 
milk until boiling, thicken with a teaspoon 
of flour, wet with cold milk, stir in a table- 
spoonful of butter and lastly a beaten egg. 
Drain all the milk from the macaroni, turn 
it in a hot dish and pour the cream over it. 
Serve at once. 

Spiced Currants. 

7 pounds ripe currants. 

4 pounds sugar. 

1 pint vinegar. 

1 pound raisms. 

4 tablespoonfuls, each, 
cinnamon 

Pick the currants over and wash care- 
fully, strain part of them as for jelly, seed 
and chop fine the raisins. Mix the currants, 
vinegar, raisins and sugar together, add the 
spices and put over a slow fire. Cook the 
mixture until it is thick, about three hours, 
then put in jars or jelly tumblers, cover and 
keep in a cool place. This makes an ex- 
cellent relish for meats and will keep an 
indefinite length of tin-e. 

Raspberry Vinegar. 

Take nine quarts of berries, mash them 
somewhat and cover them with vinegar and 
let them stand twenty-four hours, then 
squeeze out the juice and add a pint of 
sugar to each pint of juice. Boil fiftet 
minutes and then bottle tightly. A plea- - 
ant drink is made by puttin" two or three 
spoonfuls of this vinegar into 9k glftM oi WC* 
V^ater. 



of cloves and 



of food can be slowly increased, and the 
period between the times of feeding length- 
ened. A three months child will tiirive 
well on four, or at the most five meals a 
day, and the quantity given should be from 
six to eight ounces, which is about the 
quantity most nursing bottles hold. This 
rule for feeding should be followed until 
teething is completed. 

We recommend that the food be given by 
a nursing bottle, and that two should he 
kept in readiness for iise. As soon as one 
is used let it be thoroughly cleansed, esi>ecial 
care being taken with the tubing, and then 
fill the bottle with water in which a liitle 
soda is dissolved ; and put the tubing to 
soak in the same. 

The greatest care should be exercised that 
the vessels used in preparing the food 
should be clean, and the milk peifecll) 
frpsh and kept from sources of contamina- 
tions. Many bowel troubles have thcii 
origin in causes of this kind, that are often 
overlooked. 

It is important to secure milk derived 
from a cow in a healthy state, and sur- 
rounded by wholesome conditions. The 
cow should also be fresh in milk. This we 
consider one of the most important points 
in procuring milk for infants, as it has been 
clearly proved that cows advanced in preg- 
nancy do not yield a milk as easily digested, 
or as healthful, as those fresh in milk. The 
cows should of course have the best of feed, 
and pure water in abundance* 

During feeding, if possible, hold the 
child in the arms in the natural position for 
nursing ; but if it must be laid down, have 
it placed in a semi-erect position. During 
feeding and the time for digestion, the child 
should be kept quite warm, as it rec^uires 
an extra amount of warmth at such times. 

It sometimes happens that by reason of 
the change in the character of the secretions 
brought about by use of the Food, loose* 
ness of the bowels will be produced for a 
lay or two. This will cease very soon, as 
che secretions will quickly become normal. 
It mfty be regarded asa favorable symptom. 
A tendency to constipation may be over- 
cone by dccroMiDg the proportion of m\]^,

Corn Fritters or Omelet. 
Cut the corn from the cobs. To each 
half cup of com add the yolk of one egg 
well beaten, pepper and salt to taste and 
two tablespoonfuls of milk. Beat the white 
of the egg to a stiff froth and stir it in just 
before cooking. Have the griddle very 
hot and profusely buttered, and pour the 
mixture on, when nicely browned turn one 
half over the other as in cooking other 
omelets, or fry in little cakes like griddle 
cakes. 

Green Corn Pudding. 

Grate the corn from the cobs, put one 
cupful in a deep buttered baking dish, cover 
it with milk, sprinkle in a little pepper and 
salt, add a tablespoonful of butter and set 
in the oven for half an hour. Now take it 
out and stir in one egg that has been well 
beaten and return it to the oven and leave 
it only until the custard has set, a few 
minutes will be sufficient. Thi« is a most 
delicious accompaniment to a meat course. 
What is left from dinner can be warmed 
for breakfast by putting in a saucepan with 
a little butter and milk and stirring until it 
is smoking hot. 

Suoootash. 
This is made of green corn and Lima 
beans or butter beans. Have a third more 
corn than beans, when the corn has been 
cut from the cobs and the beans shelled. 
Put into boiling water enough to cover 
them and stew gentlyuntil tender, perhaps 
half an hour. Pour off nearly all the water 
and add a cupful of milk ; salt, pepper and 
butter to suit the taste and stew a few min- 
utes longer. String beans can be used, if 
cut up fine, though they are not as nice. 

Bread. 

I pint of hot water or milk. 

I tablespoonfnl of butter. 

I teaspoon ful of sugar. 

X teaspoonful of salt. 

yi cup of yeast. 
Flour. 

Put the butter, sugar and salt into the hot 
water or milk, allow it to cool until it is 
milk warm then turn in the yeast. If you 
do not care to make the yeast get a fresh 



With Condensed Milk. 

If good fresh cow's milk cannot be ob- 
tained condensed milk may be used as fol- 
lows : Take three tablespoonful of Food, 
mix with a little cold water, and add one- 
half pint of hot water ; cook thoroughly for 
five minutes, then add two teaspoonfuls of 
condensed milk and mix well before put- 
ting into the bottle. 

For Invalids. ** 

Mix three teaspoonsful of Food with a 
little water, and then add one pint of milk, 
and cook five minutes. If in any case this 
should be found too rich, make as directed 
for infants. The food may be seasoned to 
taste by the addition of salt. 

Lactated Food, With Beef Extract 

Add to Food prapared as above, two 
teaspoonsful of beef extract. Stir well to- 
gether, and add a little cloves or nutmeg. 
If It is desirable to give the extract of beef 
with the Food without milk, take from 
four to six teaspoonsful of the Food, moisten 
with a little cold water, and then mix well 
with one pint of water. Heat to boiling 
for five minutes, and add the extract as 
above. 

Essence of beef or strong beef tea can be 
made from fresh beef if preferred, and used 
in place of the extract. 

Lactated Food, With Cream. 

When an increaee in the proportion of 
fat in the food is desirable, one-fourth to 
one-half gill of fresh cream can be added 
to one pint of the cooked food. 

Lactated Food, Without Milk. 

Lactated Food, six teaspoonsful ; 
water, one pint. Moisten the Food with 
sufficient water to bring it to the consistency 
of cream, then add the remainder. Stir 
thoroughly, and boil for five minutes. If 
desired, any flavoring that is palatable to 
the patient can lie added. 

Lactated Fwd, With Aromatics. 

It is an easy matter to give to the differ- 
ent combinations of Lactated Food, a

and dissolve one-half of it in one-half cup 
of cold water. Now stir in the flour, 
make the dough stiff enough to mould a 
little with the hands. Set the pan, with a 
cover over it, in a warm place and in the 
rooming it will be full of a light spongy 
dough. Sift flour over the moulding board , 
turn tha' dough out and mould with the 
hands until the air is all worked out using 
as little flour as possible. Cut in two parts, 
mould into shape and put in buttered pans. 
When these loaves have risen until they are 
twice their original size they are ready for 
the oven. Bake from one-half to three- 
fourth of an hour in a good oven. When 
the loaves are done, take them out of the 
tins and wrap them in a thin cloth 
dampened with cold water placing a dry 
cloth over it. This steams and softens the 
crust.

LacUted Food for my baby, I b«K to •ay that we 
have found it a very excellent article, exceeding 
our expeotationa, and fully coming up to alt that 
was claimed for it. Since the baby has taken it, 
his bowels have acted more regularly and ho ap- 
pears to have bpn^flted K*'nerally from it, thriving 
well and being hotter satisfied. Wo have used the 
other artificial foods with no benefit. 

Feeling that I can recommend ^ our Pood as the 
best on the market, 1 remain vours . cspectfully,

I cannot tajr enough In praise o( the 
Food. 

Iroquois, Ont, 13th April, 1886 
To WELLS, EIOHARDSON A CO., 

Gentlemen,— Enclosed please find the sum of 
one dollar ($1.00) to poy for one large Can of 
liactated Food. Kindly forward at once. I am 
glad to say that baby oontinueH to gain, and I 
cannot nay enough in praise of the Food. A Mrs. 
H. Wallace, of this place, is now giving it to her 
baby and seems to be as much pleased with it aa 
myself. 

In your letter of the Ist inst, " you would like 
to know what were the particulars in my baby's 
case.*' I have much pleasure in replying and 
would say that when baby was only six weeks 
old, she took whooping cough— this of course was 
very hard on her and reduced her considerably, 
and after a little while was obliged to call in the 
doctor. When he first saw her he said : "poor little 
thing, her blood is very much impoverished, and 
she shows signs of indigestion," and it was only a 
few days until h^r entire body from " from crown 
of head" to "sole of foot" was just one mass of 
boils. A greater little sufferer I don't believe the 
world ever saw — you will easily believe mo when 
I tell you that the doctor had to lance her between 
sixty and seventy times. I had only used about 
one Can of Food, when we noticed quite a change. 
All the medicine we had given her wbs Syrup of 
Iron and Bhubarb. In concluding I may say, it 
was through the kindness of Dr, J. S. Stephenson 
of this place that I was induced to try Lactated 
Food, and I believe he recommends it now more 
strongly than ever, very lespectfully, 

MRS. C. 13. KEELER.

MY POOR BACK 



« ♦ » 



That "poor back" is held responsiole 
for more than its share of the sufferings of 
mankind. If your dog bites a man who 
kicks It, do you blame the dog ? On the 
same principle the kidneys utter their pro- 
test against nervousness, impure blood, and 
resulting constipation. These force them 
to do extraordinary work in ridding the 
system of the poisons which are the result 
of effete matter retained in the blood. 
Then the sufferer say the back aches ; the 
kidneys are diseas< .1. " Not yet," but they 
will be unless the nerves are strengthened, 
the blood purified, and the constipation re- 
moved. These are the cause of kidney 
troubles, and Paine's Celery Compound 
removes them quickly. With its tonic, 
purifying and laxative effect, it also 
strengthens the weak kidneys, makjng it al- 
most infallible in curing all diseases of the 
nerves and kidneys, If your hopes of c'\ < 
have not been realir^ ', try Paine's Celer; 
Compound— it gives perfect health tc sJi 
who complain of "their poor backs."

^CELERY* 

AS A REMEDY FOR 

NERVOUS Diseases 



— *•» I 



A celebrated specialist said in a recent 
lecture : " I have known many men, and 
women too, who, from various casues, had 
become so much affected with nervousness 
that when they stretched out their hands 
they shook like aspen leaves on windy days ; 
and.by the dailymoderateuseof the blanch- 
ed footstalks of celery leaves as a salad, they 
became as strong and steady in limbs as other 
people. I have kno\vn others so very nerv- 
ous that the least anoyance put them in a 
state of agitation, and they were almost in 
constant fear and perplexity, who were also 
eflfectually cured by a daily moderate use of 
blanched celery as a salad at meal times, I 
have known others cured by using celery 
for palpitation of the heart. Everybody 
engaged in labor weakening to the nerves 
should use celery." 

1 o obtain the greatest benefit from its 
use it should be combined with other nerve 
tonics which have the effect of increasing 
the range of maladies for which it is adapted, 
and with remedies which have direct action 
on the important organs of the body. 

Just this is what is done in Paint's Celery 
Compound, and the result is a remedy 
which has achieved a grand success in a 
great number of diseases. 

It is especially recommended for that de- 
bilitated condition in which a person seems 
all nerves, and when there is lack of 
strength and energy. 

For their condition a true nerve tonic is 
wanted, and this quality is supplied by the 
Celery, Coca and Hops in Paine's Celery 
Compound. Weak nerve s are sure f o bring 
on disorders of the stomach, bowels or 
kidneys. In Paine's Celery Compound 
there are combined the most efficient alter- 
atives, laxatives and diuretics, and by their 

I and strength.

gar, put in another layer of apples and su- 
gar, and so on until the apples are all used, 
having sugar on the top. Place a cover over

i;t*i< 



'£,"•» 






brown lightly in the oveu. 



Few outside of their own sex have any 
idea of the sufferings which women endure, 
and for the most part uncomplainingly. The 
knowledge is kept from huslj.ind and family, 
and oftentimes from the physician. Many 

of the troubles are the direct outcome of the 
constant, imperative demands of household 
work. The "breadwinner" has his vacation 
and recreation and is made as comfortable 
as possible, but th ■ silent partner in the firm 
is unheeded, and it is not till worn out and 
broken down in health as well as spirit, and 
stretched upon a bed of pain, that the idea 
crawls into some men's heads that the patient, 
uncomplaining woman by their side has ac- 
tually borne the brunt of the battle. The 
troubles from which women suffer arise, like 
most other diseases, from a deranged liver 
and stomach, and weak kidneys, the result 
of weak, impure, vitiated, poisonous blood. 
Then follows constant and periodical sick 
headache, acne in the back and kidneys, pains 
in the sides and under the shoulder-blades, 
feelings of lassitude and despondency, bear- 
ing down pains across the loins. A^hen the 
nervous energies are thus exhausted and 
these troubles with costiveness and dyspepsia 
warn you that your delicate organism requires 
invigorating and regenerating, take Paine's 
Celery Compound to cure and prevent the 
disorders to' which your sex is liable. ^

COCOA, A SOUTH AMERICAN NERVINE. 
This now famous medicinal plant is a 
small shrub about four feet high, growing 
m the mountains of South America. It ^ 
also cultivated in some parts of Columbia, 
Brazil and Argentine Republic, as the de- 
mand for the leaves for medicinal use has 
grown to be very great. 

Cocoa was used by the Aborigines lone 
before their conquest by the Spaniards. It 
was regarded as a divine gift and employed 
by them in religious ceremonies. Thev 
spoke of it as " that Heavenly plant which 
satisfies the hunger, strengthens the weak, 
and makes men forget their misfortunes." 
It hasbeeniisedbythe Nativesimmemorially 
as a nerve tonic by chewing the leaves with 
some alkaline substance. It enables th^m 
to pass whole days in travelling or working 
without food, not to supply the place of nu- 
tnment, for they eat freely in the evenings, 
but to sustain the strength and nerve for 
^"2 ^"^^^ ^5 "**y ^ necessary. 

Many scientific observers strongly confirm 
the statements in regard to the sustaining 
powers of Cocoa. It imparts increased vigor 
to the muscles as well asto the vitality, and 
causes an indescribable feeling of satisfac- 
tion, which is not followed by any feeling 
of languor or depression. ^ 

From the foregoing it is evident that in a 
great number of cases of neverons weakness 
accompamed with languor, or with an "all 
gone felling, such a medicine as Paine's 
■ Celery Compound, which combines, in a 
I remarkable manner, the best qualities of 
Cocoa, reinforced with Celery and other tonic 
and alterative remedies, is what is needed, 
and will surely restore strength and vigor 
and enable one to again take up the duties 
ol life with energy and pleasure. 

For the aged this medicine is especially 
valuable. It strengthens the whole system, 
and regulates the kidneys and bowels The 
stomach is enabled to properly digest ap- 
propriate food, rheumatic and neuralgic 
pains are quickly relieved, sound sleep is pro- 
duced naturally, and so the energy and spirit 
of middle life is renewed. If you have an 
aged friend who is run down i vqh r^a" d" 
nothing better than to make him' a present 
of a bottle of Paine's Celery Compound.

It is impossible to give an accurate rule

Some people seem to think that a disease 
which has been growing upon them for years 
can be cured in a day, or a month at the 
farthest. Applying the same re.isonitig, if 
it took them ten days to go to Europe, they 
would expect to return in an hour. One 
would be as sensible as the other. 

When the laws of health have been vio- 
lated for years, until at last the system can 
stand it no longer, and sicknaei results, if 
one bottle of Paine's Celery Compound 
does not remove in a month the results of 
overtaxing the physical system for ten or 
twenty years, and restore it to a normal 
condition, the user says : *♦ Of course it 
helped me, but it didn't cure me," and be- 
gins using something else, which -ioes no 
good. If Paine's Celery Compound is 
given a fair trial, and its use continued for 
a time that is proportionate with the severity 
and duration of the disease, it will, with 
hardly an exception, result in a complete 
cure. Even the exception, at some other 
time, when diet and climate aid the medi- 
cine, will almost invariably yield to the 
curative properties of this grand remedy. 

If one or two bottles do not cure, don't 
get discouraged, but continue its use even if 
a dozen bottles are needed. You know of 
friends who have been under a physician's 
care for years, and are not yet cured, al- 
though they still have hope? W^hy not 
treat Paine's Celery Compound with half as 
much fairness, if your disease is a chronic 
and severe one. Even then your time and 
expense in gaining health will be far less 
than your friend's. The many testimonials 
we have received as to the almost infallibil- 
ity of Paine's Celery Compound in curing 
all diseases of the nerves, blood, kidneys, 
and bowels, warrant us in telling those who 
use it that it will cure sooner and surer 
than other medicines, although in long- 
standing cases it may be necessary to take 
U for months*

they can be found, and they are equally as 
sucessful in Great Britain, Australia, India, 
China and the Islands of the Sea. If you 
will attentively read the directions given 
herewith, you will see for how many uses 
they are applicable and how easily they are 
applied. 



Have you Anythingf to Color? 

Many persons to whom this book will 
come will think they have no use for Dyes, 
"They may be very good for other peo- 
ple but we never use any such thmg." 
Now these are the very ones who would find 
by looking around the house that they have 
any number of things that have been laid 
aside and cast off that can be made as good 
as nev/ by being re-colored, or that can at 
least be made over for younger members of 
the family. Dresses, coats, cloaks, wrap- 
pers, shawls, hoods, scarfs, ribbons, feath- 
ers, <Sr»c., can be colored over any color 
desired. 



How to Buy Dyes. 

When you make up your mind that you 
wish to do some coloring, the natural course 
if you live in a large town, is to go to your 
druggist or merchant and ask for the color 
of dye which you wisn. Fortunately almost 
all of them now keep the Diamond Dyes, 
and those only. It is necessary, however, 
to be cautious, for in some old fogy places 
they have old-fashioned dyes, both in bulk 
and in packages, which they try to sell, but do 
not be mduced to take these. Insist upon 
having the Diamond Dyes, and find some 
live dealer who keeps them. Then there 
are, also, unscrupulous dealers who will try 
to foist cheap imitation of the Diamond 
Dyes on their customers, because they can 
buy them at low prices, and make more 
profit on them. Avoid these too. You will 
regret it if you try lo use anything but the 
Uiamond Dyes. These only represent the 
latest pcienttfic achievements in this field, 
.Ttul thtse are the only ones so prepared 
that any one can use them with success. 



How to Select the Best Color 

to Use. 

Ask the dealer to show you he sample 
book, and study that carefully. If your 
goods are light colored, and of silk or wool 
you can use any dye you please, and you 
can make any shade of that color, from tl e 
lightest to the darkest. If your goods ar • 
cotton or mixed goods, study the sample 
book that shows the colors made on cotton. 
If your goods are dark colored, lead what 
is said on the back of the sample card abont 
coloring over other colors, and you can eas- 
ily tell what color you can get. Remember 
that you cannot, by dyeing, make a color 
lighter ; it must be darker, and the color 
which is on the goods will always influence 
to a greater or less extent, the color which 
you are able to attain. 

Does Dyeing Pay ? 

Some one has said that the most un- 
common sense is common sense. It 
certainly seems so sometimes, when we 
see how often the lack of it leads to 
needless waste, and prevents persons 
from getting the full ben^'fit of many useful 
articles. The object of these pages is to 
inform those who may desire to know, how 
many articles of personal and household 
use may be so renewed that they can be re- 
garded as almost as good as ever for further 
service. They may have been discarded 
long before they have worn out because the 
colors have grown faded or dingy, or become 
unfashionable. The sensible woman, how- 
ever, M^ll want to know if there is not some 
way ir which these articles can be renewed 
or changed in color and appearance so that 
they may again be made serviceable. 

We arc glad to imferm all such inquirers 
that the celebrated Diamond Dyes are just 
the thing for every such emergency. 

Now does it pay to use these Dyes ? 

The question answers itself when you 
once know the facts, for with a ten cent 
package you can, in half an hour or but 
little more, do as much coloring as a dye- 
house would charge from fifty cents io two 
dollars for Dresses that otherwise wouid 
be cast aside, can be restored to nearly

their original value. Ribbons, feathers, and 
scores of other articles can be colored and 
the value increased ten times the cost of the 
Dye ; and it pays just as well to make your 
own ink, blueing, dr'cfrom Diamond Dyes 

Preparing the Dyes for Use. 

Having procured the color of Diamond 
Dye which you wish to use, put the powder 
in a large bov\l, or a bright tin or granite 
iron dish, moistan it with cold water, and 
then pour on sufficient boiling water to dis- 
solve it completely. Before using, it is 
always well to stiain through a cloth, that 
no undissolved particles may get 
into the dye bath to spot the goods. The 
exceptions tf» the above rules are the black 
and some other of the dark colors, for which 
follow the special directions on the package, 
which should be carefully read before com- 
mencing. Do rot think that you do not need 
to read them because you have used the 
Dyes before, for the improvements we 
sometimes make in the Dyes necessitate 
changes in the directions. 

For those Dyes for which vinegar is di- 
rected to be used, be sure that it is not for- 
gotten, as it is important in order to enable 
the Dyes io go on the goods readily and to 
set the color. 



Oolorixig Yarns, Carpet Ragrs &o 

There are probably more Dyes used for 
these nurposes than for any other, and such 
has been the casealways. In many sections 
of the country every thrifty house-wife spins 
yarn and makes carpets or rugs. We wish 
to remind all such that the most disagree- 
able part of the work has been completely 
revolutionized by the introduction of the 
wonderful Diamond Dyes. By their use 
the coloring can be done in one- fourth the 
time and at less expense than with the old. 
fashioned dyestuffs.while the colors are more 
brilliant and durable. It your materials 
are cotton, remember to get the special 
cotton colors. 



household. Before that it was only done 
by the regular dye houses and the expense 
was such that few made a practice of hav- 
ing it done 

Now at a trifling expense, it can be done 
many house, and any one can save money 
every year by the extra wear they can get 
from garments that have been renewed in 
this way. Coats, cloaks, and heavy gar- 
ments can be dyed without ripping. If 
dresses are to be made over of course it is 
best to rip them but if not, it is only necess- 
ary to let out the drapery in order that they 
can be easily handled in the dye-bath. 
After a lady has once felt the comfort of 
having faded or dingy dress or garment 
made as good as new by Diamond Dyes, 
she will not fail to use them often for these 
purposes. 



Buyingr Shop- Worn Goods. 



Ooloring Garments. Dresses. &o 
since the Diamond dyes have been off- 
ered to the public, dyeing of large garments 
has become easy a.nd praclicable ia erery 



Every merchant accumulates during the 
season more or less goods that become shop- 
worn or for some other reason have to be 
sold at low prices. Ladies everywhere are 
beginning to understand how easy it is to 
make these articles as good as new by re- 
coloring them with Diamond Dyes. 
Money can be saved by buying dress-goods 
shawls, hoods, stockings, that have become^ 
shop-worn «5r»c., and re-coloring them to 
desirable shades with Diamond Dyes. 
Merchants are often glad to sell such articles 
for one- fourth or one- half their value, and 
for a trifling expense they can be made as 
good as fresh goods. White cotton stock- 
ings can be bought very cheap and colored 
equal to the high-priced ones. 

Ooloringr Dr aperies, Coverings, 

Articles of this kind can be colored with- 
out difficultv, and we have seen many things 
that have become badly demoralized by age 
and exposure to the light, made to look%s 
good as new by the use of Diamond Dyes. 
Wc know it takes some confidence in one- 
self and faith in tht^ Dv^e K«fr.r* « r.>r<">n 

feels like undertaking these larger jobs, 
but we have never known faith in Diamond 
Dyxs to be misplaced.

.Coloring Feathers 

Feathers readily take the most beau- 
tiful colors from Diamond Dyes. Clean 
the feather by soaking in strong soap-suds 
fifteen minutes, then draw gently between 
the thumb and forefinger a number of times 
and rinse in warm water ; dye up to the 
shade required, rinse in cold water, and 
press gently with the hand between two 
cloths, to remove the water. Now hold 
before a gentle fire, shaking slightly until 
nearly dry, and then curl by taking three 
sprigs of the feather and drawing briskly be- 
tween the thumb and the back of scissors, 
and so on until it is finished. Old feathers 
can be re-colored and made to look like 
new. To color feathers a good black is 
difficult, and can only be done by a special 
process, and we do not vecommend inexper- 
ienced person? to try it. 

Live birds can be colored the most 
brilliant shades by simply applying a solution 
of the Dyes with a bmsh or a sponge. A 
number of druggists have made a handsome 
display of colored birds or chickens as an 
attractive window advertisement, and it 
never fails to draw a crowd.

Do not use the colors too strong. School 
childern will be greatly interested in color- 
ing their drawings in this way. 



Ooloring Hoods, Shawls, dec. 

These articles are used by every lady 
and are frequently made of white or very 
light-colored material, and as a conquence 
very quickly become soiled or faded. 
Then they are usally discarded, or given 
away. Now there is nothing easier than to 
color these articles, and thus make them as 
as good as new. Every lady should try 
Diamond Dyes foi this purpose, and she 
will be delighted with the results. Simply 
follow the directions on the package and 
you will come out all right. 

Coloring Photographs, Engrav- 
ings, Maps, &o. 

The beautiful art of coloring photographs,

Coloring Easter Eggs. 

The practice of having these beautiful 
tokens on Easter morning has spread 
through all Christian lands. From Dia- 
mond Dyes the most beautiful colors can 
be obtained, and at a trifling expense, as it 
takes but the small portion of a package of 
Dye to color a dozen eggs, and the balance 
of the package can b« used for some other 
purpose. Boil fresh, clean, white eggs at 
least ten minutes. Add a little dissolved 
Dye, any color wanted, and a teaspoonful 
of strong vinegar to a pint of water, then 
put in the eggs and let them remain until 
of the desired shade. The eggs may be 
eaten with safety after being colored. 

The Diamond Easter Dyes are prepar- 
ed expressely for the purpose of coloring 
eggs, and four colors are put in one package 
and sold for ten cents. No 1 Easter Dyes 
contain four light colors, yellow, pink, blue 
green ; and No. 2 Easter Dyes contain four 
dark colors, red, violet, orange and dark

Ladles' Shoe Dressing. 

A Liquid Dressing for ladies' shoes, sup- 
erior to any sold in bottles, can be easily 
and cheaply made as follows :— By the aid 
of heat, dissolve two ounces of Borax, and 
four ounces of Gum Shellac in a quart of 
hot water. Some time is necessary for this. 
If the gum dots not wholly dissolve — strain. 

"While still hot, dissolve two packages of 
Diamond Slate Dye in the liquid, and 
adu one-half ounce of glycerine. Apply 
to the shoes with swab of sponge or cloth. 
Made in this way, shoe dressing does not 
coEt more than one-fourth its cost in bottles 
and it can be depended on as the very best. 
Black kid gloves when worn, can be dress- 
ed over with this blacking, and made nearly 
equal to new in appearance. 

Ooloringr Hair. 

Articles made of real hair fade badly after 
a few season's use. It is of great value to 
ladies two know that these can be made to 
exactly match any darker shade, by carefully 
treating them with Diamond Black Dye. 

Switches, or any article made of hair, 
should be washed with soap and water to 
remove grease, then be dipped into a weak 
Dye, hot, made with the Black Dye. It 
takes but a moment to make hair two or three 
shades darker. When dyed, wash in weak 
soapsuds, rinse, dry by a gentle heat, and 
dress with a little oil. The Brown Dye is 
not suitable for hair. White hair of any 
kind can be colored any of the bright 
or dark colors.

Dissolve the dye by moistening with cold 
water, then slowly add a pint or more of 
boiling water, stirring until disolved. AH 
goods must be washed clean with soap, rin- 
sed well and dyed while still moist. Use 
sufficient hot water to cover the goods 
easily, add a small portion of the dissolved 
dye, and enough nice vinegar to give it a 
sour taste. 

Put in the goods and with two sticks 
lift and stir constantly to allow the dye to 
penetrate to every part alike. 

Keep the dye at a boiling heat, and if in 
a tew minutes the goods are not dark 
enough, take out and add more. Repeat 
the process as often as necessary and press. 
Attention to the above directions will in- 
sure an even and beautiful color. 



The great simplicity of the Diamond 
Dyes will be seen by these directions, 
which are so easy to follow that even a 
child could have no difficulty with them. 

By taking care to handle the goods while 
in the dye, perfect results can always De 
had. Do not use too much dye at ihe 
start, as even colors are surer if the dye is 
not too strong.

special directions given on the packages, as 
being very simple and easily followed. 



Precautions in Dyeing. 

In coloring it is of much importance that 
good water should be used, as hard, impure 
water injures the beauty of the shades. For 
Diamond Dyes always use fresh, clean, 
soft water. Wooden, tin, earthen or en- 
amelled vessels should be used for bright 
colors. Brass or iron may be used for the 
dark colors. 

All old articles, before coloring, should 
be thoroughly washed with soap and water, 
to remove all dirt or grease, and rinsed in 
hot water, and dyed while still damp. 

The vessel used for coloring should be 
large enough to permit the goods to be 
worked easily and withput crowding • 

Always stir the bath before entering the 
goods, and enter them as openly as possi- 
ble ; wifih a clean stick in each hand, lift 
and stir constantly, to enable the dye to 
penetrate to every part alike. 

Be sure that everything you use is clean • 
and free from grease. After dyeing, rinse 
well in clean water, and dry in the shade. 
When any particular shade of color is 
required, the dye should be tested by dye- 
ing a small piece.of the stuff. 

Stains of the dyes can be removed from 
the hands by using powdered pumice-stone 
or Indian-meal and soap, or for the dark 
colors a little vinegar. 

The shade of the goods can be nearly 
told by looking through them toward the 
light, or overhand.

the Diamond Dyes, either for any of the

To Color Sheepskin Mats. 

Stretch the skin side upon a flat board 
drawing it out tightly as possilile and tack 
it down firmly. It can then be turned up- 
side down, and by proper appliances low.;!-- 
ed just far enough into the bath so the skin 
wiU not touch by an inch or two. Or 
two persons oan stand opposite each ether 
and each hold two corners, allowing each 
parttodip into the dye bath, moving gently 
until all parts are colored alike. 

Staxnpingr Powder. 

The white powder is usunUy oxide of zinc 
but fine whiting or fine chalk will do. To 
this powder add enough Violet Dye powder- 
ed fine, to g've it a distinct color. If to be 
used for wet stamping, wet up with benzine 
away from the fire ; if for dry stiimping 
mix with each ounce of the colored powder 
one-eight ounce of powdered rosin, and pass 
a hot iron over the wor\, fixing it by the 
heat. 



Ooloring Loat'aer. 

Leather can be easily colored by applying 
a solution of the Dyes with a brush or sponge. 
In a larfre way the skins ire placed back to 
back and then lipped into the Dye bath. 

Colored Crayons. 

Colored Ciiyons for school use can easily 
1)6 made fron; the cheap white Crayons. 
Use the fr"// /?;//\,^ Crayon. Place as many 
as are needed in the cup and pour on Dyt 
to cover them. I.tt it stand about ten 
miriutes. Then pour otfthe Dve to be kept 
for further use. IMace the wet Crayons 
where they will be kept warm about twelve 
hours. Any number of colors may be 
made in the same way. 



Colored Lacquer or Transparent 

Paint. 

Beautiful rolored Lacquers or Varnishes 
can be made from the Diamond Dyes by 
dissolving a very small amount of the color 
wanted in white shellac varnish. In this 
way a handsome colored coating, perfectly 
transparent, can be put on any object 
wanted, whether of metal, glass, wood or 
stone. We recommend for this work the 
Cotton Colors without the mordant. 



ofeansinsT and Restorlngr Faded 
Qarments without Ripping. 

It is often the case that articles of gentle- 
men's wearing apparel become faded from 
exposure to the weather long before they 
are half worn, and many people in the large 
cities make the cleansing and restoring of 
such garments a paying business. The 
method is easy and can be done by any one 
with ordinary care. The garment must be 
first sponged over with warm water, to which 
a little soap has l)een added, and all spots 
cleaned thoroughly. Make a solut-on of 
Diamond Dyes the original color of the 
garment, and apply oarefuHy with a sponge 
[attached to a stick], or stiff brush, using 
care to touch every part alike ; hang up to 
dry and press while damp. If one treatment 
does not give sufficient depth of color, go 
over it again. The best results are obtained 
by the use of the darker cblors — Black, 
Navy Blue, Seal Brown, Dark Green or Plum.

Laundry Blueing. 

To make a quart of the best Laundry 
Blueing, dissolve one Package Blue for 
Coiton (the Dye only) in a quart of hot 
water, tnd bottle. Use in the same way as 
ordinary blueing, to which it is much super 
ior, at a fraction of the price.

ami none more easily executed. 



Directions For usinff 
Diamond Paints. 



the 



Lustral Painting. 

The cheapest and best paints to use in 
this art, n.m so popular, aje the Diamond 
I AINTS-Gold, Silver, Copper and Bronze. 
1 hese colors are the ones mostly used, but 
It others are required they can be got at any 
art store. ' 



Bronzingr Chandeliers, Lamps, 
Ebonizing Furniture, «fec. 

In nearly every house there are nas fix- 
tures or lamps that have become decidedly 
the worse for wear. These can literally be 
made as good as new by a caiefnl applica- 
tion of the DiAMONn Bronze oiGoLD Paint 
No one who caies for appearances will fail 
to make use of them, for their application : 
IS simple and easy, and the expense incon- ! 
siderable. For ebonizing furniture, or any 
wooden or metallic article no other pre- 
paration equals the Diamond Artists' 
ulack. One trial will convince any one 
of Its usefulness. ' 





. Prepare the liquid for mixing the Bronze 
Paint by adding half an ounceof Varnish to 
an ounce of Spirits of Turpentine. Keep 
m a well -corked vial. 

Put a small quantity of the metallic pow- 
der into a saucer or other shallow dish, add 
as much of the liquid as will render it rather 
less fluid than common paint, give a slinht 
stirring with the brush, and it will be fit 
lor use. If a large quantity is mixed at once 
the .netallic particles will subside, to avoid 
this It must l)e mixed in small quantities, 
say about a drachm of each, and a slight 
motion given to the paint each time a fresh 
supply IS taken with the brush. Never mix 
more than is required for the work in hand. 
Apply the paint with a camel-hair brush. 
•Pancy Baskets can be painted with any 
shade desired, or with a combination. 

Grasses, Graws, Insects, ButterfliSs 
cSr-C, can be gilded with the Paints, and 
when nicely mounted are exceedingly rich 
and handsome. 

FijRNiTURE, Frames, Ornaments, and 
all objects wherever a little tasteful gildins 
will improve the .appearance. Diamond 
1 Ai NTS are very useful. 

Many other uses will occur to ingenious 
minds, and for every appropriate use the 
Diamond Paints will be found to give per. 
feet satisfaction. *" ^ 

Old Wicker Chairs can be s^nJned with 
mahogany color made from Diamond Dyes 
and It some parts are gilded with the Dia- 
mond Paints it will make them very hand- 
some. ^

t.ty and Quality. Sold by Druggists and 
Merchants everywhere.
