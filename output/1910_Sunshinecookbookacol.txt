cut in slices and put in fruit jars. Fill the jars with a syrup 
made of one cup vinegar, one-half cup water, two cups

HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 



MAGIC SILVER CLEANER. 

i qt. gasoline, ]/ 2 lb. whiting, 

l /s oz. olic acid. 

Shake well together. A woolen cloth dipped in this mix- 
ture and dried is excellent to clean silver. 

MILDEW. 

The English method of removing mildew is to moisten 
the spots with warm water, rub on a little soap, then sprin- 
kle well with powdered chalk and salt and dry in the sun. 

If the hands are rubbed on a stalk of celery after peeling 
onions, the smell will be entirely removed. 

TO STOP MOUSE HOLES. 

Fill the mouse hole with laundry soap and stick a few 
sharp-pointed nails through the soap. 

TO THAW OUT A FROZEN WATER PIPE. 

Pour into the pipe a cupful or more of common salt. 
Usually the drain will soon be all right after this has been 
done. 

Chloride of lime should be scattered, at least once a week, 
under sinks and in all places where sewer gas is liable to 
lurk. 

TO REMOVE INK SPOTS FROM A THIN WHITE 

DRESS. 

Soak the dress in a kerosene bath, rubbing all the ink 
spots with common yellow soap. At the end of half an houi 
wash it with soap and water and no trace of ink will remain. 

Turpentine and black varnish put into any good stove 
polish is the blacking used by hardware dealers for polish- 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 169 

ing heating stoves. If properly put on, it will last through- 
out a season. 

If oatmeal is soaked over night in water it requires only 
about one-half the time to cook. 

If eggs are to be boiled hard, have the water boiling when 
the eggs are put in it. This will prevent the yolks turning 
dark. 

Preparatory to frying liver or veal, cover it for a minute 
or two with boiling water. Pat dry with a clean towel, roll 
in flour and fry (in a covered pan) until brown. 

CLEANING FLUID. 

Y% oz. of ammonia, )/% oz. of bay rum, 

% oz. of ether, }i oz. oil of wintergren, 

V% oz. of chloroform, i qt. of deoderized ben 
20 grs. powdered borax, zine. 

1 oz. of alcohol, 

Do not shake before using, but pour out a small quantity 
into a cup. 

The easiest way to clean a coffee pot is to boil it in water 
containing soda. 

Put lye into the water that you soak your granite kettle 
with, in which somehing ha c beer, burned black, and you 
will have no trouble washing it the next morning. 

TO DESTROY BED BUGS. 

Take good alcohol and put as much corrosive sublimate 
in it as it will dissolve; then take a small paint brush and 
wash all places where they are about once or twice a week 
and they will soon disappear. 

TO CLEAN HAIR BRUSHES. 

Clean hair brushes and combs by washing them in a 
quart of water in which has been stirred three or four tea- 
spoons of ammonia. 



I-O SUNSHINE COOK BOOK. 

WHEN A KETTLE THREATENS TO BOIL OVER. 

Grease the rim lightly all around with a bit of butter. The 
contents will touch this danger line, but will not pass it. 
Stewpans, in which vegetables are boiling, may be treated 
in the same way. 

TO TURN THE HEMS OF NEW TABLE NAPKINS. 

It is a good plan to put the napkins through the narrow 
hemmer of an unthreaded sewing machine. This gives a 
more narrow and more even hem than can be turned by 
hand, and the needle, going through the linen, gauges fine 
stitches for the- hand sewer. 

Tubs will not warp or crack open if the precaution is 
taken to put a pail of water into each, directly after use. 

TO KEEP EGGS. 

Slack i pt. of lime and y 2 pt. salt in 3 gallons of cold water. 
Stir once in a while for three days, then stir thoroughly 
and pour over eggs that have been packed in jars. Have the 
eggs covered with brine. 

FRESHENING UP POTATOES. 

If the potatoes are old and the cook has reason to fear 
that they will turn black in cooking, she should add a little 
milk to the water in which they are to be boiled. This is 
certain to prevent such unsightly discoloration. 

BAKING POWDER. 

y 2 lb. tartaric acid (com- t lb. corn starch, 

mercial), Ya lb. baking soda. 

Sift together three times. Use as you would Royal Bak- 
ing Powder. 

WASHING FLUID. 
1 lb. Babbitt's lye, y 2 oz. salts of tartar, 

]/ 2 oz. ammonia. 
Dissolve in 1 gal. of warm water. Use one cupful for large 
washing. 

When whipped cream is to be served, always add the 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 171 

white of one egg for each pint of cream used. Beat the egg 
white a little before adding it to the sweetened and flavored 
cream. Note how fine and firm the cream will be. 

To test jars: — Wash and rinse the jar, fill about half full 
with hot water, place a new rubber and cover on it, fasten 
securely and invert the jar on a newspaper spread on the 
table, leave for a few minutes, and if any sign of moisture 
oozes from the jar, change the top or rubber or both and 
try again. 

If the paper is perfectly dry the jar is tight, and you can 
be sure your labor will not be for naught. 

If cabbage is soaked an hour in salted cold water, then 
boiled uncovered, there will be scarcely any odor. 

Six dozen lemons will make ten quarts of lemonade and 
will serve seventy persons. Peel the lemons for use. 

Six quarts of ice cream will serve thirty-six persons. 

To mix a smooth batter easily use at first very little milk 
or water and make a thick, smooth paste, then add the re- 
maining liquid. 

TO DESTROY CARPET BUGS. 

Take V 2 lb. of tobacco (long cut) and l /i lb. camphor 
gum, put together in an old pan and melt to a powder. 
Sprinkle wherever troubled with carpet bugs and it is a sure 
remedy. 

HOW TO GIVE CHILDREN CASTOR OIL. 

Take one cup of milk, one of molasses, half a cup of 
sugar, y 2 cup of castor oil, a teaspoonful of carbonate of 
soda, 2 teaspoons of ginger, a little salt, and enough flour to 
make a stiff paste. Roll out like cookies, cut into fancy 
shapes and bake in a quick oven. One or two of these cook- 
ies are as good as a dose of oil. 

Rice has a better flavor if washed in hot water instead of 
cold, before cooking. 

If rice is not disturbed diving the process of boiling, the 
berries will be whole, dry and easily digested. A few drops 



172 SUNSHINE COOK BOOK. 

of lemon juice added to the water will make it whiter and 
finer flavored. 

Canned vegetables, like canned fruit, are improved in 
flavor, standing open an hour or two to restore the oxygen 
that was eliminated in cooking. 

The smaller a roast of meat, the hotter should be the 
oven at first, that the least possible amount of its delicate 
juices may escape. 

The small paper bags that fine groceries come in are a 
better protection to the hand than gloves for blacking 
stoves. 

POPCORN. 

Put a quarter cup of lard into a large kettle over the fire. 
When it melts put in a scan* cup of corn and a teaspoon of 
salt and stir until it begins to pop, then put on a cover, 
holding it to one side a little and with a long handled spoon 
stir rapidly until enough corn has popped so it will not snap 
out of the kettle. Then remove the cover and stir as long 
as it will pop, then take from the fire and stir a minute 
longer to make it tender. 

TO CHOP SUET. 

Break the suet in small pieces. Sprinkle with flour and 
chop in a cool place. 

TO SEED RAISINS. 

Pour boiling water over them, cover and let stand about 
ten minutes, then pinch them and the seeds will come out 
clean. 

TO REMOVE THE SKINS FROM TOMATOES. 

Lay them in a wire basket and let them stand in boiling- 
water two or three minutes. 

TO REMOVE IRON RUST OR FRUIT STAINS 
FROM LINEN. 

Dip the portion in a strong solution of oxalic acid made 
by dissolving the oxalic acid in hot water. When the stain 
disappears wash the cloth thoroughly in warm water. 



A GOOD HOUSEKEEPER. 



I 73 



A GOOD HOUSEKEEPER. 

How can T tell her? 

By her cellar; 
Cleanly shelves and whitened wall. 

I can guess her 

By her dresser; 
By the backstaircase and hall. 

And with pleasure 

Take her measure 
By the way she keeps her brooms. 

Or the peeping 

At the keeping 
Of her back and unseen rooms, 
By her kitchen's air of neatness, 
And its general completeness, 
Where in cleanliness and sweetness 
The rose of order blooms.

Every Good Cook Knows 

That the first essential of 
good cooking is the use of 
good ingredients. 

EVERY 
EMBROIDERER 

Should know that the first 
essential of successful em- 
broidery is the use of the BEST EMBROIDERY SILKS 
obtainable. It is alike a waste of time and money to use 
inferior silks that are likely to run in washing and render the 
finished piece worthless after the first washing.
