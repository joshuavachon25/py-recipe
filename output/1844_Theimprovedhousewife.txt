Google 



This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing tliis resource, we liave taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying.

personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain fivm automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liabili^ can be quite severe.

PREFACE 



Brevity, is one object of the "writer — not to multiply 
Dooks ; nor to present, even one, large book. But on the 
contrary, by corrections and by new receipts, to improve the 
successive editions; and thus present a useful book, in as 
concise form as possible. 

The obvious want of a suitable text-book for the Culinary 
Department, has induced the writer to prepare this work, 
being mostly the result of personal experience as house- 
keeper, for the last thirty-four yean. 

" Most of the receipts now in use, are the result of chance, 
or the whim of a depraved appetite/' Their insufficiency is 
well known, and it has long been the subject of complsunt. 

Many new receipts, it is believed, are now for the first time 
presented to the public. Selections have also been made 
from other compilations — such as have been proved to be 
good, by actual trial. 

While this book is intended for all dasses of society, em- 
))rac]ng receipts both for rich and for plain cooking, it is 
especially intended' as a guide to those who would cook well, 
and please the palate at small expense — considerations of no 
small importance at all times. 

In conclusion, — ^the writer would humbly hope that her 
experience may lighten the care, dissipate the. perplexities, 
and guide the judgment of all who fill the station, or assume 
the duties of Cook, or of Old or " Young Housekeeper.'*

7. Calfs Head. 

Cut thin slices from 
a to &, to the bone. 
The throat sweetbread 
T lies a^ e. Slice from e 
to d^ and help that with 
the other part. Should 
the eye be requested: 
extract with the point 
of the knife, and help to a portion. The palate, a delicate 
morsel, lie; under the head. The sweet tooth, too, not an 
inferior delicacy, lies back of all the rest, and, in a young 
calf, is easily extracted with the knife. On removing tht 
jaw bone, fine lean will appear. Help to each of these. 

8. Shoulder of Mutton, 

Slice to the bone at 
the line a, and help 
thin pieces from each 
side. The choice fat 
lies at the outer edge, 
at b. Should more be 
needed than can be 
gotten from those 
parts, slice on either 
side of the line c, which represents the blade bone ; and 
nice pieces may be obtained. From the under side, also, 
by slicing horizontally. 

9. Leg of Mutton, 

The nicest part 
lies at a, midway be- 
tween the knuckle 
and the other end. 
Thence, cut thin 
slices each way,* as 
deep as b. The out- 
side being seldom 
very fat, some favorite pieces may be sliced off the broad

CARViNti. 




end at e. The knuckle is tender ; but the other part more 
juicy. Some good slices may be cut lengthwise, from the 
broad end of the back of the leg. The cramp bone is much 
thought of by some : to get it, cut down to the bone at d^ 
and in die curve line to e. 

10. Spare Rib, 

Carve, first, slices from 
the fleshy part, tracing the 
line a, b. This will give a 
proportion of lean and fat ; 
and being removed, sepa- 
rate the rib, placed in the 
direction J, b, e ; breaking it at the point c. If an entire 
rib is too much, a slice of meat may be taken from between 
two ribs. 

11. Leg of Pork, — [See Ham.] 

The stufiing, in a roast leg, will be found under the skin, 
at the thick end. 

12. Fore Quarter of Lamb, 

Separate, first, the shoul- 
der from the scoven, which 
constitutes the ribs and the 
breast, by sliding the knife 
under the knuckle, in the 
direction of a, i, c, leaving 
on the ribs a due proportion of meat. Place it on a different 
dish. Now squeeze half a Seville orange on the oth^r 
part, which, being sprinkled with salt and pepper, should be 
carved in the direction c, d. This will separate the gristly 
part from the ribs. Now help from either, as may be the 
choice, carving as directed by the lines e, f 

13. Saddle of Mutton, 

Cut long slices, on each side 
of the back bone, in the direc- 
tion a, 5. ^s some are fond of 
a joint of the tail, they can 
easily be served by cutting 
between the joints.

of the knife at c, cut as deep as possible in the direction 
c, d. You may now, at pleasure, slice from either side. 
As the fat lies deeper on the left, those who like fat, as 
most venison eaters do, may be helped to the best flavored 
and fatest slices on the left of the line c, d. 




ing thin circular pieces, 
at the knuckle. 



18. Hatn, 

Ham may be carved 
three different ways. 
Usually^ commencing 
by long delicate pieces, 
cut to the bone through 
the thick fat, in the line 
a, 6. A second way is, 
to cut a small round hole 
on the top, as at c, tak- 
The most saving way is to begin 




19. A Fowl. 

It will be more con- 
^ venient carving this to 
take it on to your plate, 
replacing the joints, as 
[a separated, neatly on the 
dish. Place the fork 
in \Jie middle of the 
breast, and remove the wing in the direction of a, 5, sepa- 
rating the joint at a, and lifting up the pinion with the fork, 
and drawing the entire wing towards the leg. This draw- 
ing will separate the fleshy part more naturally than cutting. 
Cut between the leg and the body at c, to the joint 5. * By 
giving the blade a sudden turn the joint will break. Re- 
peat the same operation for the other wing and leg. Next, 
take off the merrythought by drawing the knife across the 
breast and turning the joint back ; and then remove the 
two neck bones. Divide the breast from the back, by cut 
ting through all the ribs, close to the breast. Turn the 
back up ; half way between the extreme, ends press the 
point of the knife, and on raising- the rump end the bonir

will part. Take off the sidesmen, having turned the ramp 
from you : — and done. 

The wings should be made as handsome as possible. 
These, with the breast, are the most delicate parts of the 
fowl ; the legs are more juicy.

I||K|^^^Hm^^2^^ smaU end of the pinion and 

^^^^^^^^^"'''■^^^^ press it close to the body, 
divide the joint at a, carrying the knife along as far as b. 
Take off the leg by an incision from & to e, and separate 
the drumstick Part the wing and leg from the other side, 
and between the lines 1 and 2, cut long slices from each 
side of the breast. The apron must be removed by cutting 
from (/ to ^, by c, to get at the stuffing. The merrythought 
being removed, the neck bones, and all other parts are to 
be divided as in a fowl. 

A Duck may be carved in a similar manner. 

21. Turkey. 

To jcarve, without withdrawing the fork, place your fork 
firmly in the lower part of the breast, so as to have the 
turkey at perfect command. It is not difficult to complete 
the entire carving of this fowl without extracting the fork 
till done : the whole back, of course, making one joint. 
Proceed to remove the wing ; the leg ; another wing and 
leg. ^(This may be done, either before, or after, slicing 
the breast.) Next, remove the merrythought, the neck 
bones, the neck itself; then, catting tlu-ougli the ribs, the 
job is done. 

, 22. Partridge, 

Carved as a fowl. Wings, breast, and merrythought, are 
the best parts. The two latter not often divided. The 
wing the best joint. The tip the very best. 

3* 



'^t> CARVING. 



23. Pigeons, 

Halve them, dividing lengthwise ; or so as to make the 
breast and wings form one division. The lower division 
generally preferred. 

Woodcocks, Grouse J ^c. are carved like fowls, if not 
M>o small ; when they must be cut in quarters. 

Snipes should only be halved. 

24. Hare. 

Insert the point of the 
knife inside the shoulder at 
a, and separate the entire 
length to the rump at b. 
The other side being done 
in the same way, the hare 
is in three pieces. Slide 
the knife under the rise of the shoulder at a, b, to remove 
it. Serve the leg in a similar manner. Next, decapitate. 
Take off the ears close ; and separate the jaws. Place the 
upper jaw flat on a plate, and putting the point of the knife 
into the forehead, bisect it through the centre of the cra- 
nium to the extreme end of the proboscis. Cut the back 
into convenient portions ; lay the pieces neatly on the dish, 
and proceed to serve the company, giving some stuffing, 
(which will be found inside the hare,) and gravy to each 
person. 

The back and legs are prime parts. By some, the ears 
are considered a luxury. So also the head and brains. 
The tail is a rare delicacy. They may be distributed to 
those who like them. 

Should the hare not be very tender, it will be difficult to 
divide the sides from the back ; but take off the legs by 
cutting through the joints. You will then be able to cut a 
few slices from each side of the back. Next, dissever the 
shoulders, which are called the sportsman's joints, and are 
preferred by many. The back, <fec. may then be carved 
us directed above 




A WORD FOR THE DINNER-TABLE. 27 



A WORD FOR THE DINNER-TABLE. 



As Host. — An invited company of ladies and gentlemen, 
each alternately seated at the dinner-table, and a blessing 
invoked ; you will dispatch sotp to each, from a pile of 
plates on your right, without questioning any whether you 
shall help them or not. Dealing it out silently ; you will 
help the person at your right hand, first ; then at your left, 
and so on. 

You will carve the meats yourself, of course. And you 
will not ask to be allowed to help your guests, but will 
supply a plate in silence, and hand it to your servants,' who 
will offer it to such of the company as are unprovided. 
Never offer fish or soup a second time. 

If a dish be on the table, some parts of which are pre- 
ferred to others, according to the taste of individuals, all 
should have the opportunity of choice. Simply ask each 
one if he has any prefetence for a particular part. If the 
reply is in the negative, do not repeat the question, nor 
insist that he must have a preference. So, where different 
dishes ; do not insist on your guests partaking of a particular 
dish, nor ask persons more than once. Never force a sup- 
ply upon their plates. / 

Do not attempt to eulogize your dishes, nor to apologize 
that you cannot recommend them. 

As Guest, — Being seated, when soup is offered take it ; 
but if you prefer fish, pass it to your neighbor. You must 
not ask for soup or fish a second time. 

If asked whether you have a preference for any dish, or 
any particular part of a dish, unswer plainly and distinctly, 
as you wish. 



38 ▲ WORD FOR THE DINNER-TABLE. 

When you are helped to any thing, do not wait till the 
rest of the company are served. 

Finally, to be at ease, is a great step toward enjoying 
yoor own dinner, and making yourself agreeable to the 
company. 

The Servmtj should serre every thing at the Irfi hand 
of the guest.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. 



For most preparations, it is easier to measure than to 
weigh. 

25. Solids. 

Butter, when soft, one pound ... is one quart.

26. Liquids. 

Four Spoonfuls are half a gill. 

Eight Spoonfuls are one giU. 

•Two Gills, or sixteen Spoonfuls are . half a pint. 

Two Pints are one quart. 

Four Quarts are one gallon. 

Twenty-five Drops are one teaspoonful. 

Four Spoonfuls are one wineglassful. 

Twelve Spoonfuls are one teacupful. 

Sixteen Spoonfuls, or half a Pint, are . one tumblerful or 

coffee-cup. 
Whenever the word spoonful or spoonfuls, is used, in this 
work, a large, or table-spoon, is meant. But as measures 
of the same name differ in capacity, it will require judg- 
ment and practice to be familiar with due proportions.

MEATS. 



Though the marketing and the carving, have been 
deemed of sufficient importance to give them the few pftgeil 
allotted to them ; yet compared with the disposition^ or the 
use made, of what comes into the hands of the housekeeper, 
these pages are but blank paper. The interim, the time 
between the marketing and the serving out, may emphati- 
cally be styled the housekeeper's time. 

When the weather will admit of it, meat will improve by 
keeping ; beef and mutton a week, in cold weather, and 
poultry half as long. It will soon spoil in hot weather. 
It should be kept away from flies ; where cool and airy ; 
and if in danger of spoiling, rub over it a little fine salt, and 
sprinkle with pepper. *It will not cook well, if frozen when 
put to the fire, either to boil or to roast. It should be 
soaked in cold water till the frost is extracted. Furiom 
boiling hardens meat. Put the part that is to be up at table, 
down in the pot, with just cold water enough to cover it ; 
and boil gently. The scum should be taken off as soon as 
it rises. The slower the boiling, the tenderer the meat. 
As a general rule, do not let the vessel stop boiling till its 
contents are cooked. The observance of this rule is indis- 
pensible for good puddings, potatoes, &c. Replenish with 
boiling water, if the addition of water be necessary. 

When thickened and seasoned, the liquor in wliich all 
kinds of fresh meat are boiled, makes a good soup. Thus 
used, boiHng is the cheapest way of cooking meat. Other- 
wise, the dearest ; as most of the gelatine is extracted and 
lost. 

In roasting meat, the juices and fat are only extracted, 
bat not lost, as they make good gravy ; and the fat is used

for various purposes. When put down to roajst, there should 
be a little water in the dripping pan. 

For broUing, the gridiron should be perfectly •clean, and 
oiled with lard or butter, to prevent the impression of the 
bars on the meat. The bars should be concave, terminat* 
ing in a trough, to save the juices, and thus prevent smoking 
the meat by the burning of the drippings. The gridiron 
should be heated before the meat is laid on it ; and a good 
fire of live coals is necessary, to have the meat broil as 
quick as possible, without burning. The receiving dish 
should be very hot, and the meat not seasoned till placed 
upon it. 

To fry meat, first, slice a small piece of pork, and fry a 
light brown, and take up. Then, put in your meat, per- 
fectly dry. When done enough, take it up. Remove the 
pan to cool ; when cool, turn in a little cold water for the 
gravy, and place it on the fire ; when it boils, stir in a little 
mixed flour and water; let it boil; then pour it over the 
"^ meat. Add butter and catsup, if not rich enough. 

27. Roast Beef. 

The best pieces for roasting, as will be seen by looking 
at the engraving, are the tenderloin, and the first and second 
rib cuts. The two next are good. 

The bony sides should first be placed towards the fire, 
on putting Uie meat down, with a little salt sprinkled over 
the w&ole. After the bones are well heated through, turn 
the meat, and keep a brisk fire. While roasting, baste it 
often. When the meat is put down, a little water should 
be put into the dripping pan. 

A thick piece of meat requires fifteen or twenty minutes 
to the pound, to roast ; if a thin piece, fewer minutes will 
do it. 

28. Roast Beef Southern Mode, 

Select a rib roasting-piece, that has hung ten of fourteen 
days ; bone it nicely ; rub salt over it ; roll it tight ; bind it 

* To avoid repetition it needs but be mentioned kerCf that every thing 
pertaining to cookery should be perfectly clean, not ex( epting operator 
nor operatre.«s.

•round with twine; put the spit through the inner fold, 
without sticking it into the flesh ; skewer, and roast it well ; 
dredge and froth it, when ahout done ; and ^mish with 
scraped horse radish. 

29. Beef Steak, Broiled. 

The round and clod make good steaks, but the inside of 
the sirloin is the best. 

Lay the steak on a gridiron, placing it on a bed of hot 
coals, and broil as quick as possible without burning. From 
.6Aeen to twenty minutes will be required. Turn it often. 

For eight pounds of beef, cut up from three to five ounces 
of butter ; heat the platter very hot, that is to receive the 
steak; lay the butter on it; take up the steak; salt and 
pepper both sides. To be good, it should be eaten imme- 
diately while hot. Very little butter, if a few slices of salt 
pork be broiled with the beef, will make a good gravy; 

30. Beef Steak, Southern Mode. 

For steaks, the best part is the seventh and eighth ribs : 
the fat and lean being better mixed, and more tender th^n 
the rump. 

Cut them half an inch thick, and beat them a little ; broi] 
quick, turning them often ; have a dish very hot ; put some 
slices of onion in it ; lay in the steaks ; sprinkle a little 
salt ; pour on them one spoonful of water, and one of mush- 
room catsup, boiling hot ; garnish with scraped horse radish ; 
and put on a hot dish-cover. 

31. Beef Steak, Fried. 

Such pieces as are good for broiling, are also good for 
frying. 

Brown a few pieces of salt pork ; take them up ; put in 
your beef; when brown on both sides, take it up and re- 
move the pan to let the fat cool. When cool, pour in foui 
spoonfuls of water ; mix two teaspoonfuls of flour with a 
little water ; mix it with the fat ; replace the pan on the 
(ire ; stir it till it boils up ; pour it over the beef. 



84 ^ AtlSATS. 

32. Liver, » 

BeePs Uvei is good fried, but is best broOefl aboat 
minutes, with salt pork*; then cut both into small strips ; 
put them in a stew pan, with a little water, butter, and pep- 
per ; stew about five minutes. First, scald the liver. 

33. Alamode Beef. 

The round is best. The shoulder clod is cheapest ; is 
good, too, stewed without spices. 

For five pounds of alamode beef, soak a pound of bread 
in cold water till soft> turn off the water, mash the bread 
fine ; add a piece of butter of a hen's egg size, half a tea^ 
spoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of ground cloves, of all- 
spice, of pepper, half a nutmeg, two eggs, and a spoonfid 
of flour: mix all well together; gash the beef; £11 with 
half the dressing ; place it in a baJke pan, with lukewarm 
water enough to cover it; cover the pan with the lid heated, 
and set it where it will stew gently two hours ; then turn 
on the top the other half of the dressing, and heat the lid 
hot enough to brown it. Stew an hour and a half longer. 
On taking up the meat, if tl^e gravy is not thick enough, 
mix, with a little water, a teaspoonful or two of flour, and 
stir into the gravy ; add a little butter, and a glass of wine, 
and turn it over the meat. 

34. To Frizzle Beef, 

Shave off very thin pieces of tender, fresh smoked beef; 
put them in a stew pan, with just suflicient water to cover 
them, and let them stew ten or fifteen minutes. Three or 
four minutes before taking up, stir in a mixture pf a little 
flour and water, to thicken the water, adding a little pepper 
and butter. A good dish for breakfast — accompanied with 
eggs, still better. 

35. Boiled Beef 

The perfection in boiling beef is, to boil slowly, and to 
skim the pot well. If the scum boil in, by adhering to tlie 
meat, it causes a dirty appearance. The boiling may* at 
any time be checked, by remoxdng partially, or entirely, the 
pot lid. 



MEATS. 

lo hot wcai^er, it is so difficult to keep beef sweet, h is 
best to com it in the pot, as it is boiled. Put in a teactip 
of sah to eight pounds of beef; sprinkle floor on the side 
dutt is to lay up 'on the dish, and lay it down in the pot; 
pour water into the pot, enough to cover the meat, and 
keep it covered, afler the meat is put in. Boii two hours ; 
add more coid water, and boil another hour and a halfl 

36. To Collar a Flank of Beef. 

Take a select flank of beef; rub it well with salt and a 
large portion of saltpetre ; let it lie ten days ; then wash it 
clean ; remove the inner and outer skin, with the gristle : 
spread it on a board, and cover the inside with the follow- 
ing mixture ; sage, parsley, thyme chopped fine, pe]^r, 
salt, and pounded cloves. Roll it up ; sew over it a cloth ; 
bandage that with tape ; boil gently, from ^ve to six hours ; 
take it out ; when cold, place it on a board without undoing 
it ; put another board on the top, with a heavy weight ^cm it ; 
let it lay twenty-flve hours ; take oflT the bandages ; eni a 
slice from each ^id ; garnish with sprigs of parley and 
green pickles, and. serve it up. 

37. Cunies. 

Veal, Mutton chops, chickens, pigeons, and lobsters, all 
make good curries. Joint your fowls, if a fowl etirry^'dish 
is to be made ; boil them in barely suflicient water to cover 
them, till tender ; add a little salt. Fry, till brown, Uiree 
or four slices of pork, just before the fowls are du;ie enough 
to take up. Take up the pork, and put in the chickens ; 
l»own ^em ; then add part of the Hquor in which they 
were boiled, a teaspoonful or two of cuny powdeor, and the 
fried pork. Mix a teaspoonful of curry pow^r widi twelve 
spoonfuls of boiled rice, or with a mixture of a litHa t^bxa 
and water ; pour it on the curry, and stew a few mintttea. 

38. Sweetbread^ Heart, and Liver. 

Fry sweetbread, moderately, where two or three pieces 
frf* salt pork have been browned and taken V3^, Oa remov- 
ing the sweetbread, stir into the fat two teaspoonfuls of 
fl^ mixed with a lit^ water. On boOing, ponr it over the 
sweetbread. 



36 MEATS.. 

Another way. — Parboil the sweetbread ; let it get cold ; 
tlice it in inch thick pieces ; dip them in the yolk of an 
egg and fine bread crumbs, first sprinkled with pepper, salt, 
and fine sage ; brown them lightly. Mixing smooth, a little 
flour and water, make a gravy by stirring ^em into the fat 
Add spices and wine if liked. 

The heart and liver may be cooked in the same way. 

39. To Brown Mince Meat. 

Mince cold roast beef very fine, fat and lean ; add salt, 
pepper, chopped onion, and a little gravy ; fill scollop tins 
two-thirds fldl, and fill up with potatoes mashed smooth 
with cream ; lay a piece of butter on the top, and brown 
them in an oven. 

40. Tripe. 

After being thoroughly scoured, tripe should be soaked 
in salt and water about a week, shifting the water every 
eight and forty hours ; then boil till tender, or from eight to 
ten hours ; then pickle, fry or broil. Pickle it the same as 
souse. 

41. Meats Warmed Over. 

Roasted or boiled veal makes a good dish, chopped fine 
and just moistened with water, seasoned with a little butter, 
pepper, and salt, and warmed up. A little nutmeg and the 
yellow part of a lemon rind, ^ated fine, improve it. When 
well heated, take it up, and garnish it with two lemons cut 
in slices. 

Salt or fresh beef is good, chopped fine, with boiled po- 
tatoes, and warmed up with a little water, pepper, and salt ; 
add a little butter just before you take it up. 

Boiled turnips, or onions, instead of potatoes, are good 
mixed with minced meat. 

Mutton, lamb, and veal, are good cut into small strips, 
and warmed with boiled potatoes sliced, with a little water, 
salt, and pepper ; add butter just before taking up. 

Rare roast beef and mutton are nice sliced and just 
warmed on a gridiron. 

Meat that is warmed over, should be on the dre just long 
enough to heat through. 



MEATS. 37 

Cold fowls are fine, jointed and warmed with a little water, 
dien taken up and fried brown in a little hotter. Sprinkle 
a litde flour on them before frjdng. Thicken the water in 
which the fowls were warmed, adding butter, pepper, and 
salt, and then turn it on the fowls. ' 

42. Yeta, 

The best piece of real for toasting is the loin. The* 
breast and rack are good also. The breast makes a good 
potpie, and the rack is good, cut into pieces and bfiSed. 
The leg is fine for frying ; and after sererai slices hare 
been taken off for cutlets, the rest is nice for boiling with a 
piece of salt poik. 

43. Roast Veal 

For roasting, veal should be peppered, salted, rubbed 
over with a little butter, and frequently basted. A little 
water should be put jn the dripping pan, and if the meat is 
not quite fat, a little butter should be added. 

44. Baked Veal, ^ 

For baking, the fillet is good. The bone should be cut 
out, and its place filled with a dressing made of bread 
soaked soil in cold water, two eggs, pepper, salt, and a 
spoonful of melted butter, then sewed up. Put it in the 
bake pan, with a pint of water ; and, with some of the dress- 
ing, cover' the top of the meat. * When done, on taking up, 
thicken the gravy with a little fiour and water well mixed, 
putting in a small piece of butter, and a little wine and cat- 
sup, if a rich gravy is liked. 

45. Veal and Chicken Potpie. 

Joint the chickens, if made of them, and boil them til] 
half done ; take them out ; put them, dry, into a pot, making 
alternate layers of crust and fowl, seasoned with pepper 
and salt ; then, pour in the liquor in which the fowls were 
boiled, upon the upper layer of crust, which covers the 
fowls. If a brown crust is desired : with a heated bake 
pan lid, keep the pot covered. Add, firom the tedcettle, 
boiling water, as that in the pot wastes. Raised pieonist 
is preferable to that made for fruit pies, though, if but little

shortened,' that is good. For raised crust, mix a teaspooo- 
ful of salt, and a teacup of melted butter, ivith three pints of 
flour, and then pour in half a teacup of yeast, adding cold 
water to make it stiff enough to roll out ; placing it where 
warm, it will require from seven to eight hours to riae, un- 
less you use brewer's yeast. Roll it out, when risen, and 
cut it into small cakes. 

Potato pie crust is good. Peel and mash fine eight 
boiled potatoes ; mix with them half a pint of milk, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a hen's egg size piece of butter, and fiour 
enough for rolling out. Put with the meat, the cakes afier 
rolled out and cut. 

By working into unbaked wheat dough, a little melted 
lukewarm butter, nice crust may be made. Before putting 
it with the meat, let it lay ten or fifteen minutes, after it is 
cut and rolled into cakes. 

46. Veal Cutlets. 

Fry, till brown, three or four slices of salt pork ; take 
them up, and put in slices of veal, cut from 'the leg, about 
an inch thick ; when brown on both sides, take them up ; 
stir into the gravy, half a pint of water, and mix two or 
" three teaspoonfuls of fiour with a little water, and stir in ; 
soak two slices of toasted bread in the gravy ; lay them on 
the bottom of the platter ; place the meat and pork over 
them, and turn on the grayy. 

A very nice way of cooking cutlets is, with half a pint 
of milk, an egg beaten to a froth, and fiour enough to ren- 
der it thick, to make a batter. When fried brown, dip the 
veal into the batter, then replace it in the fat, and fry until 
it is brown again. If any batter is left, it is fine dropped 
by spoonfuls into the fat and fried brown, and placed over 
the veal. Thicken the gravy, and turn it over the whole. 
This dish requires an hour's cooking ; and it will be best to 
stew the meat half an hour before frying it, if it is tough. 

47. To BroU Calf^s Liver. 

Cut the liver in slices, not very thin ; salt and pepper it, 
after nicely broiling, and pour on some melted butter, with 
chopped parsley, after it is dished. 



MSAT9. 39 



48. jPorce Meat Balls. 

Mijc, with a pound of fine chopped veal, one eggi^a little 
butter, or raw pork chopped fine, and season wi& salt and 
pepper, or curry powder. Fry them brown, done up in 
sniall balls. 

49. Calf s Head. 

With the lights and feet, boil the head about two hours, 
and the liver forty minutes. Tie the brains in a bag and 
boil them with the head, before it is done. When all are 
done, take them up ; season them with butter, salt, pepper 
and sweet herbs, or spices if liked, and use them as a 
dressing for the head. Part of the liver, and of the feet, 
may be prepared like the brains, for such as prefer them, 
for a dressing. 

The liquor that the head is boiled in makes a nice soup, 
prepared in a plain way, like any other veal soup, or tur- 
thized. It i^ould stand till the next day, that the fat may 
be skimmed off which rises. 

To have the head look brown, take it up when tender ; 
rub a little butter over it ; sprinkle on allspice, pepper, salt, 
and flour, and place it before the fire, under a Dutch oven, 
or in a brick one where it will brown quick. With a little 
water, salt, pepper, and butter, warm up the brains. Add 
spices and wine if liked. Serve it up as a dressing for the 
head. 

Baked calf's head is also good. Halve, and rub butter 
over it ; put it in a pan, with a quart of water ; then cover 
it with a dressing made of bread soaked soft,' a little butter, 
and an e^gy seasoned with salt, pepper, and pulverized 
mace. Slice up the brains, and place them, with the head, 
in the pan. Bake it in a quick oven, and garnish with 
force meat balls, or with slices of lemon. 

50. Calf s Feet. 

Boiling them with the head, till both are tender, split, and 
lay them roimd it ; or, after boiling them tender, and dredg- 
ing them with flour, fry them brown. If a gravy for them 
is wished : after taking them up, stir 'Some flour into the fat 



40 MEATS. 

in vliich they were fried ; season to taste, adding butter, 
and wine if wished, then torn the gravy over the meat. 

51. Scatd^ CoQaps. 

Take some reiy thin pieces of beef ot veal ; mb wi^ 
butter the bottom of an iron stewpan that has a cover to 
closely fit it ; put in the meat, some pepper, salt, a large 
onion, and an apple minced very fine ; cover the pan, and 
let the meat stew till very tender. Serve it hot. 

52. To GriU a CaipM HtaA. 

Clean and divide the head as for mock turtle ; take out 
the brains and tongue ; boil the head tender ; take the eyes 
out whole, and cut the flesh from the skull part in small 
pieces. Take some of the water the head was boiled in 
for gravy ; add to this gravy, cayenne pepper, salt, a grated 
nutmeg, and a spoonful of lemon pickle : simmer this till 
the gravy is weU flavored. Next, take the chop, pick out 
the bones ; cover it with bread crumbs, chopped parsley, 
pepper, and salt, and set it in the oven to brown. Then, 
thicken the gravy with the yolks of two eggs and a spoon- 
ful of butter rubbed into two of flour, and stew the skull 
part in it a few minutes ; put this part «n the dish ; and 
complete the whole dish by placing the grilled chop on it, 
garnishing with brain cake3 and broiled sweetbread. 

53. Yedl Olives. 

Cut thin slices off a fillet, and flatten them ; season them 
highly with pepper, salt, mace, and grated lemon peel ; roU 
up in each slice a bit of fat and tie it with a thread. Fry 
them of a light brown, and stew them in white stock, (pre- 
pared for soups or gravies,) with two dozen of fried oysters, 
a glass of white wine, a spoonful of lemon pickle, and some 
small mushrooms. Stew them nearly an hour. Take the 
threads off before serving. 

-54. Rt^ifut of Cold Void. 

Cut a Heck, loin, or fillet of veal into handsome cuUets ; 
put clean drippings, or a piece of butter, into a frying pan ; 
when it is hot, flour, and fry the veal of a light bcown; take 



XEAT8. 41 

it out ; and if you have no gravy prepared make the follow 
ing : put a pint of boiling water into the frying pan ; let it 
boil up a minute, aad strain it into a basin while you make 
a thickening; put about an ounce of butter into a stew pan; 
when it melts, mix with it sufficient flour to absorb the but- 
ter ; stir it over the fire a few minutes, and gradually add 
the gravy made in the frying pan ; let them simmer together 
about ten minutes ; season it with pepper, salt, a little mace, 
and a glass of wine, or mushroom catsup"*; strain it through 
a tamis, (coarse cloth strainer,) on to the meat, and stew 
the meat very gently till it is thoroughly warmed. Slices 
of boiled ham may be warmed with the meat. 

55. Mutton. 

Mutton is in its greatest perfection from August to Christ- 
mas. For roasting or boiling allow fifteen minutes for each 
pound. The saddle should always be roasted, and gar- 
nished with scraped horse radish. The leg and shoulder 
are good roasted ; but the best way of cooking the leg is to 
boil it with a bit of salt pork. If a little rice is boiled with 
A the fiesh will look whiter. 

For roasting, mutton should have a little butter rubbed 
over it, and salt and pepper sprinkled on it. Allspice and 
cloves, some like. Put a piece of butter in the dripping pan, 
and baste it often. The bony part should first be presented 
to the fire, for roasting. 

The leg is good to bake, gashed and filled with a dress- 
ing made of soaked bread, pepper, salt, butter, and two eggs. 
A pint of water, and a little butter should be put in the pan. 
The leg is good, too, sliced and broiled. Also boiled, 
after corned a few days. 

The rack is good for broiling. Each bone should be 
separated, broiled quick, buttered, salted, and peppered. 

The breast is fine baked. The joints of the brisket 
should be separated ; the sharp ends of the ribs sawed off; 
the outsWe rubbed over with a small piece of butter ; salted ; 
and put into a bake pan, with half a pint of water. When 
baked enough, take it up, and thicken the gravy with a little 
flour and water, adding a small piece of butter. A spoonful 
of catsupj cloves and allspice, improve it. The neck makes 
a good soup.

56. To H^erric&t Mutton, 

Take the best part of the rack ; divide it into chops, one 
bone ia each ; beat them flat ; sprinkle pepper and salt on 
them, and broil them nicely. Make a rich gravy out of the 
coarser parts ; season well with pepper, spice, and catsup ; 
strain it when done ; and thicken with butter and brown 
flour. Have ready some carrots and turnips cut into small 
dice and boiled tender : put them in the gravy, and lay 
the chops in, and stew aH fiflteen minutes. Garnish with 
green pickles, and serve up. 

57. Shoulder of Lamh, Grilled, 

Cut the shoulder, moderately deep, in checkers an inch 
long ; rub the yolk of an egg and a little butter over it.; roll 
it in finely powdered bread crumbs ; sprinkle on pepper, 
^ salt, and sweet herbs, and roast it a light brown. Use fbt 
it plain gravy, or the following : — Set on the fire, a giU of 
water with a gill of the drippings from the meat, and when 
it boils, thicken it with a little flour and water, adding a 
spoonful of tomato catsup, with the grated rind and juice 
of a lemon, seasoning with p^per and salt. 

58. ifli/iftV Fry. 

The sweetbread and heart are good fried plainly, or dip- 
ped into an egg and fine bread crumbs. Fry in lard.

59. Irish Stew, 

Take five thick mutton chops, or two pounds of the neck 
or loin, two pounds of potatoes peeled and halved, and half 
a pound of onions peeled and sliced : first, place a layer of 
potatoes at the bottom of your stew pan ; then, two chops 
and some of the onions ; repeat this process till the pan is 
quite full ; add half a spoonful of pepper, a iq>oonful of salt, 
three gills . of gravy, and two teaspoonfuls of mushroom 
catsup ; cover so close as to prevent the escape of steam, 
and stew, on a very slow fire, an hour and a half. A slice 
of ham improves the dish very much. Take care it does 
not bum.

60. P^k Sicaks. 

Slice ^lem from a neck or loia ; trim them handsomely, 
«nd pepper them ; broil them twenty minutes orer a clear 
fire, turning them frequently. When done, salt and butter 
them on the plate. 

61. To Bnnl Ham. 

Ham lA better broiled than fried. Slice it tlun, and broil 
4149 slices on a gridiron. When dished, j^aco a fined egg 
on eacli slice, and sarre out. It shouU be Ixpoiled, over 
bright hot coals, from fi.ve to eight minutea, turning it once. 

62. To Boa Htm. 

Put it oa in cold water, and let it simmer, without boil- 
ings unless very moderately, four or five hours. The water 
s}]u»uld be changed if the ham is Tiery salt Before it is 
carried to the table, take off the rind. Put over it whole 
pepper or cloves in diamond figures, if you wish to ornament 
it. A ham, if very dry, should be soaked from twelve to 
twenty-four hours in warm water before cooking. 

63. To Toast Ham, 

After boiling it well, take the skin off; cover the top 
thick with bread; crumbs^ and brown it in aa ovca 

64. To Stuff Ham. 

Take a ham well smoked and washed, and make inci- 
sions all over the top two inches deep; stuff them yU/ with 
chopped parsley and some pepper. Do not take off the 
skin. Eat it cold, after boiled. 

65. Baked or Roast Pig. 

Take out the inwards ; take off the first joint of the feet; 
- boil both tender, and chop them. Make a dressing of bread 
soaked sofi, the water pressed out, and mashed fine ; season 
with pepper, salt, and sage, adding a little butter, and then 
fill the pig with this stufiing. To prevent blistering, rub a 
little butter on the outside of the pig. Roast or bake it two 
and a half or three hours. Thi pan, in which the pig is 



44 MEATS. 

baked should contain a little water. When done, mix, with 
a little dressing and gravy from the pan, the chopped feet 
and inwards, salted, peppered, and buttered, and use this 
for a sauce. £xpose the pig to the open air two or three 
minutes, first rubbing it over with a little butter, before it 
is put on the table, to ma^e it crisp. 

66. To Barhaeue Shoot. — A Southern Dish. 

Shoat means a fat young hog, headless and footless, cut 
into four quarters, each weighing six pounds. Make seve- 
ral incisions between the ribs of a fore quarter, and stuff it 
with rich force meat ; put it in a pan with a pint of water, 
salt, pepper, two cloves of garlic, a tumber of good red wine, 
and one of mushroom catsup; bake it, and thicken the 
gravy with brown flour and butter. To facilitate the carv- 
ing, joint and cut the ribs before cooking. Lay the ribs up 
in the dish. If not sufficiently brown, add a little burnt 
sugar to the gravy. Garnish with balls. 

67. Souse. 

Clean pig's feet and ears thoroughly, and soak them a 
number of days in salt and water ; boil them tender, and 
split them. . They are good fried. 

To souse them cold, pour boiling vinegar over them,, 
spiced with mace and pepper-corns. Cloves give them a 
dark color, but they improve their taste. If a little salt be 
added, they will keep good, pickled, for a month or two. 

68. Pressed Head. 

Boil the several parts of the entire head, and the feet, in 
the same way as for souse. All must be boiled so perfectly 
tender as to have the meat easily separate from the bones. 
After neatly separated, chop the meat fine, while warm, 
seasoning with salt, and pepper, and other spices to taste. 
Put it in a strong bag, and, placing a weight on it, let it 
remain till cold. Or put it in any convenient dish, placing 
a plate with a weight on it, to press the meat. Cut it in 
slices, roll in flour, and fry in lard.

69. Sausages. 

Chop, very fine, fat and lean fresh pork ; (there shouid 
t)e a greater proportion of the lean,) season it very highly 
with pepper, salt, sage, and other sweet herbs if liked. A 
little saltpetre tends to preserve them. Do up a little into 
a cake, and fry it, to know when they are seasoned enough. 
When seasoned enough, fill your skins, which should be 
perfectly clean. To prevent the fat running out while 
cooking, mix in with the meat a little flour. Done up in 
small balls and fried, sausage meat is good. 

When fresh potk cannot be had, very good sausage cakes 
may be made of raw beef, chopped fine with salt pork, and 
seasoned with sage and pepper. When fried they should 
not be pricked, as the sausages will cook nicer to have a 
little fat put with them in the frying pan. They should be 
cooked moderately. If not liked very fat, finish them on 
the gridiron, after the sausages have been fried till nearly 
done. 

To make Bologna sausages, take equal weight of veal, 
pork, and ham, chopped very fine, seasoned high, and boiled 
till tender, in casings, and then dry them^ 

70. Venison. 

Venison is said to be most easily digested of any sort of 
meat. It is good for those who have weak and slow diges- 
tive powers. It should be kept two weeks, if the weather 
permit, afler it is killed, apd then roasted before a clear^ 
s^ong fire. 

71. To Roast Venison. 

Cover the fat parts with paper and a paste mad5 of flour 
and water to prevent their burning. Roast a haunch ot 
twelve pounds about four hours. Baste it well. Serve it 
out with current jelly. 

72. Venison Steaks. 

Broil or fry venison steaks in the same manner as veal 
cutlets, or mutton chops.

73, Mock Venison. 

MuUOQ is the best substitute for real renison. Hang up, 
for several days, a large loin of fat mutton ; then bone it, 
and take off all the kidney fat, and the skin from the upp^ 
fat ; mix together two ounces of brown sugar, one ounce 
of pulverized black pepper, and two of allspice ; rub it well 
into the mutton ; keep the mutton covered with the skin, 
and rub and turn it daily five days. When to be roasted, 
cover it Mrith the skin, and pepper it the same as for veni- 
son, first washing from it entirely the spices. Roast about 
the same time as for real venison. Serve it with made 
gravy and currant jelly. 

74. Poultry, 

No sort of animal food is so delicate and delicious as that 
of fowls and birds ; and none so generally healthful. Sel- 
dom does it disagree with those in health. The feeble in 
constitution, and such as are debilitated by sickness, find 
the flesh of fowl a nutritious and most agreeable diet. 

When well boiled, the white meat of a young turkey is 
easier of digestion than that of any other fowl. 

75. Turkey, 

Wash the turkey thoroughly, inside and out, having taken 
out the inwards. Take bread, drained and mashed fine, 
afler soaked in cold water, for the dressing. Mix with the 
dressing a small piece of melted butter, or salt pork chopped 
fine. Season it with pepper and salt, sweet herbs if liked. 
It cuts smoother if an egg is added. Any kind of cooked 
meat is good, minced fine and mixed with the dressing. 
The inwards ought to be boiled very tender, if they are to 
be used ; it is difficult to cook them through while the tur- 
key is roasting. The body and crop of the turkey must be 
filled with the dressing, and sewed up. Tie up the wings 
and legs, and rub on a little butter and salt. For roasting, 
twenty-five minutes to the pound is the rule. At first it 
should be roasted slowly, and basted frequently. When 
the fowl is put down to roast, a little water should be put 
into the dripping pan. Take the liquor the inwards are 



jpovfiM 47 

boiled in, for a gravy, adding a little of the turke) drippings. 
Place it where it will boil, thickening with a little flour and 
water, first mixed smooth. Season it with pepper, salt, 
and sweet herbs if liked. 

For boiling, the turkey is prepared in a similar way to 
the above. Parsley, lemon peel, and oysters may be added 
to the stuffing. Drawn butter is used when served out. 
If it is wished to have it look white, tie it up in a cloth, un- 
less you boil rice in the pot. Put in eight spoonfuls of rice, 
if rice is used. It is improved by the boiling of a pound 
or two of salt pork with it. If a soup is to be made of the 
liquor in which the turkey is boiled, let it stand till next 
day, and skim off the fat. Season it afler heated. 

76. Chickens. 

These, whether for boiling or roasting, should hare a 
dressing prepared as for turkies. Six spoonfuls of rice 
boiled with the chickens, will cause them to look white. 
If the water is cold when they are put in, they will be less 
liable to break. They are improved by boiling a little salt 
pork with them ; if not thus boiled they will need salt. 

For broiling, chickens should be split; the inwards taken 
out ; and then washed. Broil very slowly, till brown, plac- 
ing the bony side down on the gridiron ; then, turning it, 
brown the other side. Forty minutes is the mc lium time 
for broiling a chicken. 

For roast chicken, boil the gizzard and liver ^y them- 
selves, and use the water for gravy. Put in the gravy the 
inwards chopped fine. 

77. Fricassee Chickens. 

The chickens should be washed, after jointing and taking 
out the inwards. With the skin side down, place them in 
a stew pan, sprinkling pepper and salt on each layer ; add 
three or four slices of pork ; just cover with water, and stew 
ihem till tender. On taking them up, mix a little flour and 
water; thicken the liquor in which they were stewed; add 
a hen's egg size piece of butter ; replace the chickens in 
the stew pan, and let them stew about five minutes longer. 
When the chickens are taken up, soak, in the gravy, two 
or three pieces of toast, and put them in your nla^*'*- "^^^"^ 



48 FOWLS. 

kbo chickens on the toast, and pour the gravy over them. 
If you want the chickens browned, stew them till tender 
without the pork, then brown the pork ; take that up ; then, 
putting in the chickens, fry them till of a light brown. 

78. To Fricassee Small Chickens, — Southern Mode, 

Cut oflf the wings and legs of four chickens ; separate 
the breasts from the backs ; divide the backs crosswise , 
cut off the necks ; clean the gizzards ; put them, with the 
livers, and other parts of the chicken, after being thoroughly 
washed, into a sauce pan ; add salt, pepper, and a little 
mace ; cover with water, and stew till tender. Take them 
up ; thicken half a pint of water with two spoonfuls of floui 
rubbed into four ounces of butter ; add a tumbler of new 
milk ; boil all together a few minutes, then add eight spoon- 
fuls of virhite wine, stirring it in carefully, so as not to cur- 
dle ; put in the chickens, and shake the pan till they are 
sufficiently heated, then serve them up. 

79. Chickens Baked in Rice, 

Joint a chicken, as for fricassee ; with pepper and salt 
season it well ; place it in a pudding -dish lined with slices 
of bacon or of ham ; add an onion finely minced, and a pint 
of veal gravy ; pile up the dish full with boiled rice well 
pressed ; cover it with a paste of flour and water, and bake 
in a slow oven one hour. If veal gravy be wanting, Sjub- 
stitute water, with additional seasoning and ham. 

80. Goose. 

A goose should be dressed in the . same manner, and 
oasted the same length of time as a turkey. Be particu- 
ar to select one that is tender. See marketing plates. 

If any fowls are injured but slightly, by too long keeping, 
iip them in w^eak salaeratus water before cooking, or rinse 
he inside with sharp vinegar. Strong camomile tea may 
oe used. 

81 . To Stew Partridges. 

Truss a brace of partridges like fowls for boiling; pound 
tfie liv^ni with »wi#-e riw «iuar.titv of fat bacon and bread 



FOWLS. 4d 

crumbs boiled in milk ; add some mushrooms aiid chopped 
parsley, mace, grated lemon peel, salt, and pepper ; stuff 
them ; tie them at each end, and place them in a stew pan 
lined with bacon. If you have it, add a quart of good gravy. 
If not, two onions, water, a few blades of mace, and a bunch 
of sweet herbs. Stew gently till they are tender ; take them 
out; strain, and thicken the sauce with flour and butter; 
heat, and pour it on the birds. 

82. Pigeons. 

Lay pigeons in a pot breast side down, the inwards being 
first taken out, and they prepared with a turkey-like dress- 
ing ; pour in more than sufficient water to cover them ; put 
in four ounces of butter to every twelve pigeons, when 
stewed nearly tender, stirring into the gravy two or three 
teaspoonfuls of flour mixed with a little water. Put on a 
heated bake pan lid, if you wish to brown them, one hour 
before they are done ; or, soon as tender, fry them in pork 
fat. They are good, split open and stewed, with a dress- 
ing made and warmed up separately with a little of the 
gravy. If tender, pigeons are good stuffed and roasted. 
From two 40 three hours are requisite to cook pigeons. 
When put to the fire, roast pigeons should be buttered. 



fi3. To Stew Pigeons. 

.Clean and wash six pigeons ; quarter them ; with them, 
put all their giblets into a stew pan, a little water, butter, 
salt, pepper, a bit of lemon peel, two blades of mace, and 
some chopped parsley ; stew till tender in a closely cov- 
ered pan. Thicken the gravy with the mixture of an egg 
beaten up ; three spoonfuls of cream, and a piece of butter 
dusted with flour. Stew them ten minutes longer. Ex- 
cellent. — Economical. 

84. Ducks. 

They are good roasted, or stewed like pigeons. The 

flshy taste wild ducks have, is entirely taken out by havin/; 

an onion dressing.

85. To Bad a Duck. 

Make a paste of half a pound of butter to a pound ol 
flour ; truss the duck, putting into the inside a little salt and 
pepper, one or two sage leaves, and a little onion finely 
minced ; inclose the duck in the paste, with a little jellied 
gravy. Boil it in a cloth, and serve it with brown gravy 
poured round it. 

86. To Stew Ducks. 

Cut one or two ducks into quarters ; fry them a light 
brown in butter ; put them into a sauce pan ; add a pint of 
gravy, four onions whole, pepper, salt, a bunch of parsley, 
two sage leaves, a sprig of winter savory, and sweet mar- 
joram ; cover the pan closely and stew them till tender. 
Take out the herbs and pepper ; skim it. If the sauce is 
not sufficiently thick, mix, with two spoonfuls of it, a little 
flour and stir it into the sauce pan ; let it boil up, and gar- 
nish the dish with four onions. 

Ducks and geese, if old, are better if parboiled before 
they are roasted. Put them on in just sufficient water to 
boil them ; keep the vessel closely covered. Let a tough 
goose simmer two hours ; then dry and wipe it thoroughly ; 
stuff and roast, basting at first with a little butter. 

87. To Roast Ducks, 

JPut into a pair of ducks, an onion chopped fine, and a 
few sage leaves, pepper, and salt ; spit, and dust them with 
flour, and baste them with lard. Roast half an hour, with 
a very hot fire. The quicker roasted, the better they will 
taste. Dust them with flour, and baste them, just before 
taking them from the spit Prepare a gravy of the gizzards 
and pinions, a large mace blade, a few pepper-corns, a tea- 
spoonful of lemon pickle, and a spoonful of catsup ; strain, 
and turn it on the ducks. Send onion sauce in a boat. 

,88. To Roast Rabbits. 

After casing two rabbits, skewer their heads with their 
mouths upon their backs ; stick their forelegs into their 



TURTLE. 6J 

nbs ; skewer the hind legs doubled ; next, make a stuffing 
for them of the crumbs of half a loaf of broad, a little 
parsley, sweet marjoram, and thyme — all cut fine, pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg, to your taste ; mix them all into a light 
stuffing, with four ounces of butter, a little good cream, and 
two eggs ; put it into their bodies, and sew them up ; dredge 
and baste them well with lard ; roast them about an hour. 
Serve them up with butter and parsley. Chop the livers, 
and lay them in lumps round the edge of the dish. 

89. To Dress Turtle 

Cut off the head in the morning, in summer ; at evening, 
in the winter ; hang it up by the hind fins, and let it bleed 
well ; with care, separate the bottom shell from the top, lest 
you break the gall bladder, which, with care, take out and 
throw away ; throw the liver into a bowl of water ; empty 
the chitterlings, (guts,) and throw them into water; the 
eggs also, if any — have a separate bowl for each article ; 
slice all the meat from the under shell, and throw that in 
water ; break in pieces the shell ; wash clean and put it in 
a pot, completely covering it with water, and add to it one 
pound of middling, (or fiitch of bacon,) with four chopped 
onions, and set it on the fire to boil. Open the chitterlings ; 
clean them thoroughly ; Jtake off the inside skin| and put 
them in the pot with the shell ; let them boil three hours 
steadily ; if the water boils away too much add more. 

The top : — Wash the top shell neatly, after cutting out 
all the meat ; cover, and set it by. 

Parboil the fins ; clean them perfectly, taking off all the 
black skin, and throw them into water. Now cut the fiesh 
takeii from both shells, in small pieces ; cut the fins in two, 
and lay them in a dish with the fiesh ; sprinkle over some 
salt, and cover up the dish. 

When the shell, chitterlings, <fec. are done, or have 
boiled three hours, take out the bacon, scrape the shell clean, 
and strain the liquor — about one quart of which must be put 
back in the pot ; reserve the rest of the soup ; pick out the 
chitterlings, and cpt them in small pieces ; select all the 
nice bits that were strained out, and put them with the chit- 
terlings in the gravy ; add the fins, cut in pieces, to them, 



62 sotrpi^. 

and enough of the flesh to fill the upper shell ; add to it, if 
a largo turtle, one bottle of white wine, cayenne pepper, 
and salt, to your taste ; one< gill of mushroom catsup, one 
gill of l^mon pickle, mace, clores, and nutmeg, pounded, to 
highly season it ; mix two spoonfuls of flour with one pound 
and a quarter of butter ; add, with it, marjoram, thyme, 
parsley, and savory, tied in a bunch ; stew all these to- 
gether till the flesh and fins are tender ; wash out the top 
shell ; place a high paste round the brim ; sprinkle over 
the shell salt and pepper, then take the herbs out of the 
stew ; if the gravy is not sufliciently thick, add a little more 
flour, and fill the jshell. If no eggs in the turtle, boil six 
new laid ones for ten minutes ; put them in cold water a 
few minutes ; peel them ; cut them in two, and place them 
on the turtle. Make a rich force meat; fry the balls nicely, 
and place them also in the shell. Place ^e shell in a drip- 
ping pan, with something underneath the sides to steady it , 
heat the oven as for bread, and bake till a fine brown. Fry 
the liver, and send it hot. 

90. Turtle Soup. 

Put on, at an early hour in the morning, eight pounds of 
coarse beef, some bacon, onions, pepper, salt, and sweet 
herbs ; i&ake a rich soup^ strain, and thicken it with butter 
and brown flour ; add to it the liquor left of the boiled bot- 
tom shell ; season it very high with wine, spice, cayenne, 
and catsup ; put in the reserved flesh ; if not enough, add 
the choicest parts of a well boiled calf's head — do not use 
the eyes or tongue; let boil till tender, and serve it up with 
force meat balls in it. 

Curry powder will give a higher flavor to both turtle and 
soup than spice. 

Should you not wish soup, the remaining flesh may be 
fried and served with a rich gravy. 

91. Mock Turtle of CaHfs Head, 

Take a nicely cleaned head ; separate the upper from the 
lower part ; take out the brains ; boil, till tender, the other 
parts ; take them out of the water, and put into the watei 



SOUPS. 58 

sufEcient to cover them, a knuckle of veal, or four pounds 
of lean beef, three chopped onions, parsley, thyme, a tea- 
spoonful of pounded cloves, a teaspoonful of mace, and of 
salt, and cayenne pepper to the taste ; boil all together till 
reduced to a pint of liquor ; strain it ; add two gflls of red 
wine, one of mushroom, and one of walnut catsup ; thicken 
it with brown flour and butter. Stew a few minutes, in the 
gravy, the head and tongue cut in small pieces. Put a 
paste round the edge of a deep dish, three folds, one on the 
other, but none on the bottom of the dish ; place the meat 
and turn in the gravy, and bake till the paste is done. 
Pick out all the strings from the brains ; pound them ; add 
salt, pepper, and grated bread, and make them into little 
cakes with the yolk of an egg; fry them a nice brown. 
Boil hard six eggs ; leave one whole ; halve the five, and 
have some pieces of paste neatly baked. After the head 
is drawn from the oven, place the whole egg in the middle, 
and the pieces of paste, the brain cakes, and the other eggs, 
tastily around it. 

If it be intended as a soupy do not so much reduce the 
gravy ; but, after stewing the head, serve it in a tureen, 
with the brain cakes and some force meat balls fried, in- 
stead of the eggs. 

Instead of a knuckle of veal, or four pounds of beef, dif- 
ferent quantities may be taken, and such other variations 
made as may best please different tastes. 



92. Plain Mock Turtle Soup, 

Boil a calf's head till very tender ; strain the liquor, on 
taking out the head ; let it stand till next day ; skim the 
fat off; cut the meat up, with the lights, and put both into 
the liquor ; place that over the fire, seasoning with pepper, 
salt, mace, and cloves, sweet herbs and onions if liked ; 
stew slowly thirty minutes ; add a tumbler of white wine 
just before taking up. Chop a little salt pork, with lean 
veal, fine, adding the brains, .seasoned with pepper, salt, 
mace, cloves, sweet herbs or curry powder ; make all into 
balls of the size of the yolk of an eg^ ; boil part in the 
soup ; fry the others for a separate dish 



54 80UPS. 



93. Cdfs Feet Turtle Soup. 

Boil four calf's feet in two quarts of water, till very ten- 
der ; take the meat from the bones ; strain the liquor ; add 
a pint of good beef gravy, and two glasses of wine ; season 
with hard eggs, balls, &c, as for the two last. 

94. Oyster Soup. 

Take the oysters out of the liquor ; to every quart of 
liquor add a pint of water or of milk ; then set it on the fire 
with the oysters. Mix a large spoonful of flour with a little 
water, and stir it into the liquor as soon as it boils. Sea- 
son it with pepper, salt, and a little butternut or walnut 
vinegar, or common vinegar ; add a small piece of butter ; 
and, as soon as it boils up again, pour it on to buttered toast, 
cut in small pieces. 

95. Cream Soup. 

Take a nice knuckle of veal, or two or three shanks ; 
boil about four hours, with some pepper-corns, two onions, 
salt, a little mace, and a small bit of lean ham : strain it, 
and when cold remove all the fat and sediment ; beat six 
yolks of eggs and mix them with a pint of good cream ; 
then turn the boiling soup upon it by degrees, stirring it 
well, and add the best part of the gristles to it if liked. 

Always boil cream before putting it in sauce or soup. 

96. Pea Soup. 

Put on a quart of peas in a gallon of water, with a ham 
bone, roast beef or mutton bones, four onions, and two heads 
of celery ; boil till sufliciently soft, then strain the pea pulp 
through a sieve ; return it into the pot, with salt and pep- 
per, and boil from forty to sixty minutes. A handful or two 
of spinach, washed and cut a little, added when the soup is 
strained, improves it much ; or, in place of the spinach, 
if a few young green peas can be gotten, the Uetter. A 
teaspoonful of celery seed, or essence of celery may be 
substituted. 



SOUPS 55 



97 . Veal Soup. 

Skin about four pounds of a knuckle of real ; break and 
cut it into small pieces ; put it into a stew pan, with eight 
quarts of water ; skim it when it boils ; and reduce it to two 
quarts by simmering ; strain, and season it with salt, pep- 
per, a little niace, half a spoonful of lemon juice, and thicken 
with a spoonful of flour mixed with an ounce of butter, or a 
little rice. 

98; Blacky or Beef Soup. 

For soup the shank of beef is the best joint. Cold beef 
steak, and cold roast beef bones, make good soup. Boil 
the shank, in sufficient water to cover it, about five hours. 
Thirty minutes before putting the soup on the table, take 
out the meat, thicken the broth with scorched flour mixed 
with cold water ; season it with pepper, salt, mace, and 
cloves ; a little walnut or tomato catsup improves it. Add 
sweet herbs, or herb spirit, if liked. Some boil onions in 
the soup ; but as they are oflensive to many people, it is 
best to boil and serve them up by themselves. Make force 
meat balls of part of the beef and a little fat salt pork, chop- 
ped very fine, seasoned with salt, pepper, mace, and cloves« 
and boil them fifteen minutes in the soup. 

99. Bouilli Soup. 

Select about eight pounds of the choicest part of a thick 
brisket of beef ; lay it in a pot ; sprinkle over it three-quar- 
ters of a spoonful of black pepper, two spoonfuls of salt, 
three onions chopped small, six small carrots scraped and 
cut up, and two small turnips pared and cut into dice ; turn 
on three quarts of water ; cover the pot close, and keep it 
steadily and moderately boiling five hours, or till the soup 
is reduced to three pints. < Take ofl* the scum carefully, as 
it rises, and do not let the pot boil over. When the pot has 
boiled four hours, put in a small bundle of parsley and 
thyme, and a pint of celery cut small, or a teaspoonful of 
pounded celery seed. If boiled too long, these latter ingre- 
dients will lose their delicate flavor. Just before taking up 
your soup, brown it in the following manner : put three* 



56 S0UP8. 

quarters of a spoonful of best brown sugar into an iron 
skillet, place it on the fire and stir it till it melts and looks 
very dark ; pour into it a ladle full of the soup, little at a 
time, stirring it all the while ; strain this browning and mix 
it well with the soup, first taking out the meat, and the 
thyme and parsley. Cover up the soup and place it near 
the fire, that it may keep hot while you prepare the bouiUi. 

Take the skin ofif the beef; dip a feather in the well- 
beaten yolk of an egg and wash the top of your beef; strew 
over it the finely grated erumbs of stale bread ; put it in a 
previously heated Dutch oven ; place the top on, with coals 
enough to brown, but not enough to bum the beef; let it 
stand nearly an hour, and prepare your gravy thus : — Take 
a sufficient quantity of soup and the vegetables boiled in it; 
add to it a spoonful of red wine, and two of mushroom cat- 
sup ; thicken with a little piece of butter, and a little brown 
fiour ; make it very hot ; pour it in your dish, and place the 
beef on it. Garnish it with green pickles. Serve up the 
soup in a turedh, with bits of toasted bread. 

N.' B. If you prefer this mode of making soup, to the 
one given for black soup, you have only to take the shin in 
place of the brisket, and make it like this till you come to 
the bouiUi ; then, instead of following the remainder of this 
receipt, put the nicest pieces of the shin beef in your 
tureen, and pour on the soup and vegetables ; adding some 
toasted bread cut in dice : then serve it out. 



100. Portable Soup. 

Let veal or beef soup get quite cold, then skim off every 
particle of the fat ; boil it till of a thick glutinous consis- 
tence. Care should be taken not to have the soup bum. 
Season it very highly wivh pepper, salt, cloves, and mace ; 
add a little brandy or wine, and pour it over earthen plat- 
ters not more than a quarter of an inch in thickness. Let 
it be till cold, then cut it in three-inch square pieces, set 
them in the sun to dry, often turning them. When very 
dry, place them in a tin or earthen vessel, having a layer 
of white paper between each layer of cakes. These, if the 
directions are faithfully attended to, will keep good for a 
long time. Whenever you wish to make a soup of them. 



GRAVlEji A^V «Mr.««H' ftt 

you have only to put a quart of water to one of the cakes, 
and to make the water piping. * 

101. Soup Herb Spirit. 

Such as like a variety of herb spicery in soup, will jfind 
it convenient to have the following mixture : — When in 
their prime, take sweet marjoram, sweet basil, thyme, and 
Bummer savory; dry them thoroughly; pound and sift them; 
steep them two weeks in brandy. The spirit is then fit 
for use. 

102. Scotch Barley Broth. — A Cheap and Substantial Dish. 

Wash-three-quarters of a pound of Scotch barley in cold 
water ; put it in a pot with about ten pounds of shin beef 
sawed into four pieces ; cover it well with cold water, and 
set it on the 'fire ; when it boils, skim it thoroughly, and put 
in two or three onions ; set it near the fire to simmer very 
gently about two hoifrs ; then skim all the fat ofi*, and put 
in two heads of celery, and a good sized turnip cut into 
small squares ; season it with salt, and let it boil an hour 
and a half longer. Take out the meat carefully with a 
slice, and cover it up by the fire to keep warm ; skim the 
broth well and put it in the tureen. 

103. Gravies and Sauces. 

A great deal of the elegance of cookery depends upon 
the accompaniments to each dish being appropriate and well 
adapted to it. 

The I^rench u«e a far greater variety of gravies and 
sauces than the English or the Americans, who imitate the 
English manner of cooking. Nearly all kinds of meat gi^e 
sufficient gravy of their own ; and we should have the pe- 
culiar flavor of each, if we cooked to perfection. The 
French know this ; and their gravies are both better and 
cheaper than ours. Thus, melted butter, which is now the 
principal gravy for meats, is unnecessarily wasted, to say 
nothing of its injurious effects. The skirts of beef, the kid 
ncy, and the milt, all make excellent gravies ; the shanks* 
of mutton too ; and prepared the same as the following : 

6 



5S GRAVIES AND SAUCED. 



104. Brawn Gravy 

Slice four 2)ounds of lean beef; rub the bottom of the pot 
with butter, and put in tb» meat ; turn it often till well 
browned, and do it moderately ; then add four quarts of cold 
water. After boiling two hours, put in a spoonfed of pep- 
per-corns, one carrot, and three onions ; stew gently four 
hours longei^ ; strain it ; and when required for use, skim 
off the fat. 

105. To Draw, or Melt Butter, 

Nothing is more simple in the doing, yet nothing done so 
badly. Keep a quart tin sauce pan, with a cover to it, ex- 
clusively for this use. Take four ounces of good butter ; 
rub into it two teaspoonfuls of fk>ur ; put it in the sauce 
pan, witk 4ne spoonful of water and a little salt ; cover it, 
and set the sauce pan in a larger one of boiling water ; 
shake it continually until entirely meited and beginning to 
boil. If the pan containing the butter be placed on coals, 
the heat will reduce the butter to oil, and so spoil the but- 
ter. This quantity is enough for one sauceboat. 

A great variety of savory sauces may be made by adding 
different herbs to drawn butter, all of which are fine to eat 
with boiled butcher's meat^ fish, or fowl. 

Take parsley ; wash a large bunch very clean ; pick the 
leaves from the stems carefully ; boil them ten minutes in 
salt and water ; drain them perfectly dry ; mince them ex- 
ceedingly fine, and stir them in the butter when it begins to 
draw. 

When herbs are to be added to the butter, you must take 
two spoonfuls of water instead of one for the preparation. 

Chervil, burnet, tarragon, young fennel, and cress or 
peppergrass, may all be used ; and they must, be prepared 
in the same mode as the parsley. 



106. Burnt Butter, for Fish, Eggs, or Salad, 

Put two ounces of butter into a frjdng pan ; set on the 
fire ; when of a dark brown color, put in six spoonfuls of 
vinegar, a little pepper, and salt.

107. Draum Butter, Curry Sauce, and Egg Sa:uce, 

Always use sweet butter ; if at all hurt, the butter is more 
than lost : it spoils the gravy, and every thing it is intended 
to season. 

JVIix two or three teaspoonfuls of flour with a little cold 
water ; stir it till clear of lumps ; thi^ it, and pour on half a 
pint of boiling water, stirring it constantly ; boil it two or 
three minutes ; then cut up four ounces of butter into bits ; 
add it to the flour and water, and place it where it will 
melt. It will be free of lumps if properly mixed. Strain 
it before it is carried to the table, if not so. 

If the butter is wanted for fish, cut into it several sofl 
boiled eggs. 

If you want curry sauce, sprinkle in curry powder. 

108. Roast Meat Gravy, and DarS^GNK^. 

Put a pint of TV-ater into your dripping pan, when you put 
down your meat to roast ; just before the meat is done, stir 
up the drippings; pour them into a skillet, and put them 
where they will boil. Smojothly mix two or three tea- 
spoonfuls of flour with a little water, and stir them into the 
gravy when it boils. 

The gravy for veal and lamb, requires a little butter ; for 
pork and geese, a little of the dressing and sage mixed 
with it 

If you wish your gravy to look dark, scorch the flour 
you thicken with : — ^put it in a pan, place it on a few coals ; 
stir it continually, till a dark brown. Do not burn it. 
Sufficient may be brovmed at once for long use. 

109. Sauce for Cold Meat, Salad, or Fish. 

Boil two eggs three minutes ; mix with them a mustard- 
spoonful of prepared mustard, a little pepper, salt, six spoon- 
fuls of drawn butter, or salad oil, six of vinegar, and one of 
catsup. 

110. Wine Sauce for Venison or Mutton. 

Warm two gills of the liquor the meat was boiled in, or 
of the drip])ings ; mix two teaspoonfuls of scorched flour 



60 ORAVI£8 AND SAUCES. 

v/itii a little water, and stir it in when the^gravy boils ; sea^ 
sou it with cloves, salt, and pepper ; stir in a spoonful of 
warm jelly ; and, just before taking from the fire, a gill of 
wine. For venison or mutton sauce, many prefer melted 
currant jelly. 

Ill, Oyster Sauce. 

To a pint of oyster iiquor, put a little salt and pepper, 
and two blades of mace, (some add lemon juice ;) place it 
on the fire; on boiling, stir in two teaspoonfuls of flour 
mixed with a little milk ; after boiling a few minutes, stir 
in half a pint of oysters, and a hen's egg size piece of but- 
ter ; as soon as scalded through, take them up. 

112. Savoy Jelly for Cold Meat. 

Boil lean veal, or beef, till tender. If you have veal oi 
beef bones, break and boil them with it — they will require 
longer boiling. Boil, too, a little salt pork, sweet herbs, 
salt, and pepper. When sufficiently boiled, take it off; 
strain, and let it stand till next day ; skim off the fat ; take 
out the jelly ; and scrape off the dregs that stick to the bot- 
tom ; put in the whites and shells of several eggs, some 
blades of mace, a little wine, and lemon juice ; place all on 
the fire ; stir it well till it boils ; strain it through a jelly- 
bag till it is clear. 

113. White Celery Sauce for Boiled Poultry. 

Take six heads of celery ; cut off the green tops ; slice 
the remainder into small bits, and boil in half a pint of wa- 
ter, till tender ; mix three teaspoonfuls of flour, smoothly, 
with a little milk ; add six spoonfuls Piore of milk ; stir it 
in ; add a little salt, and a small piece of butter ; on boiling 
take it up. Some use as a substitute for part, an egg yolk, 
with a spoonful of cream, and chopped parsley and lemon 
juice. 

114. Caper Sauce, 

Is made by adding a spoonful or two of capers to drawn 
butter — many add, too, a little of the liquor. Nasturtiona 
pickled, or green pickles, minced and put with the butteii 
make a very good substitute for capers. 



<3RAVI£S AMD SAUCES. 61 



115. Lobster ISauce, 

Boil two eggs three minutes ; mix with them a teaspuon- 
ful of water and the spawn of the lobster ; rub smooth and 
stir in a teaspoonful of mustard, six spoonfuls of drawn 
butter or salad oil, a little pepper and salt, and five spoon- 
fuls of vinegar. Or, boil a little mace and whole pepper 
long enpugh to extract their strength ; strain, and melt in it 
three-quarters of a pound of butter. Cut the lobster in very 
small pieces, and stew in it till tedder. 

116. Tomato Sauce, 

Peel and slice twelve tomatoes ; pick out the seeds ; add 
three pounded crackers, salt, and pepper; stew about 
twenty minutes. 

117. Gravy Sauce. ♦ 

Beef of good quality, and roasted with care, affords the 
best sauce for the meat. Free it of the sediment and fat ; 
add a little salt, and, if not thick enough, a mite of browned 
flour, and boil it up. A little butter may be added to the 
veal gravy. 

118. Common Sauce. 

Plain butter, drawn or melted thick, with a spoonful of 
walnut pickle, or catsup, makes a very good sauce. But 
you may multiply additions according to variety of tastes. 

119. Parsley and Butter. 

Is made by adding parsley that has been chopped fine, 
after boiling a few minutes, to drawn butter. 

120i Pudding Sauce. 

Stir to a cream a teacup of butter, with two of brown 
sugar ; add a glass of wine or cider ; flavor it with rose- 
water, essence of lemon, or nutmeg. If you would have it 
liquid, heat about three gills of water boiling hot ; mix three 
teaspoonfuls of flour with a little water, and •stir it into the 
boiling water ; stir this into the butter and sugar, as soon 

as it boils up well.

62 GRAVIES AND 8AUCE8. 



121. Cranberry and Apple Sauce. 

To stew cranberries till soft, is all that is recessary to 
make cranberry sauce. When soft, stir in sugur and mo- 
lasses to sweeten it. Scald the sugar in the sauce a few 
minutes. Strain if you please — 'tis good without. 

Apples should be pared and quartered. If tart, you may 
stew them in water ; if not, in cider. After stewed soil, 
add a small piece of butter, and sweeten to the taste. 

Another very good Vay is, to boil 4he apples without 
paring, with a few quinces and molasses, in new cider, till 
reduced one half. Straia the sauce when cool. Mado 
thus, the sauce will keep good for months. 

122. Chicken Salad, 

Boil a chicken that does not exceed in weight a pound 
and a half. When quite tender, take it up, cut it in small 
strips, and prepare the following sauce and pour on it : — 
Boil four eggs three minutes ; take them out of the shells ; 
mash, and mix them with two spoonfuls of drawn butter, 
twelve of vinegar, a teaspoonful of mixed mustard, the same 
of salt, a little pepper, and essence of oelery. 

123. Sauce for Turtle or Calf's Head. 

To four gills of hot drawn butter, or beef gravy, put a 
little sage, basil, or sweet marjoram, the juice and grated 
rind of half a lemon, k little cayenne or black pepper, and 
salt ; add a glass of white wine just before you take it up. 

124. Mushroom Catsup. 

Lay fresh mushrooms in a deep dish ; strew a little salt 
over them ; then add another layer of fresh mushrooms, and 
salt : and so on till you get in all the mushrooms. Let them 
lay some days ; mash them fine ; and to each quart put a 
spoonful of vinegar, half a teaspoonful of pepper, and quar- 
ter of a teaspoonful of cloves. Pour it into a stone jar ; set 
the jar into a pot of boiling water ; let it boil two hours ; 
then strain it without pressing the mushrooms. Boil the 
juice fifteen minutes ; skim well ; let it stand a frw hours to 



GRAVIES AND SAUCES 63 

settle ; then pour it off carefully through a sieve; bottle, und 
cork it close. Place it where cool. 



125. Celery Vinegar. 

Take two gills of celery Beed ; pound and put it in a bot« 
tie, and fill it with sharp vinegar ; shake it every day, for 
two weeks ; then strain it, and keep it for use. It will im- 
part an agreeable celery flavor to every thing with which 
it is used. 

A delicious flavor of thyme may be obtained, if gathered 
when in full perfection. It should be picked from the 
stalks, a large handful of it put into a jar, and a quart of 
vinegar or brandy turned on it; Cover it very close. Next 
day, take all the thyme out, and put |n as much more. Do 
this a third time ; then straih, bottle, and secU the cork. 
This is far preferable to dried thyme. Mint may be pre- 
pared in a similar manner. The flavor of both these kinds 
of herbs must be preserved by care in the preparation. If 
permitted to remain more than twenty hours in the liquid, 
they will impart an unsavory taste. 

126. Sauce for Cod^s Head. 

Take a lobster ; stick a skewer in the vent of the tail, to 
keep the water out ; throw a handful of salt into the water ; 
when it boils, put in the lobster, and boil it half an hour ; 
pick off" the spawns, if any, and pound them very fine, in a 
marble mortar, and put them into half a pound of drawn 
butter ; take the meat out of the lobster, pull it in bits, and 
put it in your butter ; add a spoonful of lemon pickle, a 
spoonful of walnut catsup, a slice of lemon, a slice or two 
of horse radish, a little pounded mace, and salt and cay- 
enne to your taste ; boil them one minute ; then take out the 
lemon and horse radish, and serve it up in your sauceboat 

127. Fish Sauc^of Liver. 

Boil the liver of the fish ; mash it fine ;_stir it into drawn 
butter ; put in a little black pepper, or cayenne, two tea* 
^poonfiils of lemon juice and a spoonful of catsup. 



64 S66S. 

128. Gravy for Ducks, 

Boil »ll the giblets but the liver, one hour, in a pint ol 
water, with a chopped onion, some salt, and pepper ; strain, 
and add a very litUe browning, and a teaspooniiil or two 
of mushroom catsup. 

129. Duck Sauce. 

Boil eight or ten large onions ; change the water two or 
three times while they are boiling ; when done, chop them 
on a board, to have them retain a good color ; put them in 
a sauce pan with four ounces of butter and two spoonfuls 
of good cream ; boU it a IMe, and turn it over the ducks. 

130. Brown Sauce for Poultry. 

Slke two or three onions, after they are peeled ; sprinkle 
them with flour, and fry them brown, in a Uttle butter ; 
sprinkle in a little flour, salt, pepper, and sage ; add half a 
pint of the liquor the fowl was boiled in, and a spoonful of 
catsup ; if liked, when it boils up, stir in half a wineglass 
of wine. . 

131. Boiled Eggs. 

Put eggs into boiling water ; if you like the white just 
set, boil about two minutes ; if you like the yolk set, boil 
three ; if for a salad, boil ten minutes. Boil a new-laid egg 
half a minute longer than a stale one. Another mode, 
which is very nice for fish, is to break the shells, and drop 
the eggs into a pan of scalding water ; let the pan stand till 
the white has set ; then place it on a moderate fire ; when 
the water boils up the eggs are done. Eggs look very 
pretty done in this way, the yolk being just visible through 
the white. Serve them up with burnt butter, if not wanted 
for a garnish. 

132. Poached Eggs. 

Break the eggs into a pan, (it is a good precaution, in 
case of a bad egg, to break each separately into a teacup ;) 
then put them into a buttered tin pan ; place the pan on a 
few coals ; put in a small piece of butter, and a little salt ; 



nsH^ 65 

let them cook very moderatoly, stirring them continaal^y 
till they become quite thick, then turn them on to spread 
toast. 

133. Omelet. 
To twelve eggs, beaten to a froth, put three ounces of 
finely minced boiled ham, beef, or veal ; (if veal, add a little 
salt ;) melt four ounces of butter to a lukewarm temperature, 
and mix a little of it with the eggs ; put the remainder of 
the butter on the fire in a frying pan, or tin ; when quite hot, 
turn in the beaten eggs, and stir till they begin to set. When 
brown on the under side it is sufficiently done. It* should 
be cooked on a moderate fire, and in a pan so small as to 
have the omelet about an inch thick. When you take up 
the omelet, place a flat dish over Ihe top, and turn your pan 
upside down, 

134. Egg Balls. 

Boil four eggs ten minutes ; when they are quite cold, 
put the yolks into a mortar, with the yolk of a raw egg, a 
teaspoonful of flour, some chopped parsley, a little salt, a 
little black pepper or cayenne ; rub them well together, and 
roll them into small balls, and boil them two minutes. 

135. Fish. 

" Fish is a dish which is almost more attended to than 
any other," — attention from the time of its being caught to 
the time of serving out. It is easier of digestion than meats, 
with the exception of salmon. 

Small trout are the most delicate for invalids. Lake fish 
are also excellent. All kinds of fresh water fish are health- 
ful, if cooked immediately after being taken. But the ocean 
is the chief dependence of our fish markets. It would be 
better for the healthof those who do not labor, if they would 
use more fish, and less flesh, for food. With the exceptioi\ 
of salmon and lobsters, there is little danger, in our country, 
of this kind of aliment being eaten to excess. 

Flesh is much more nutritious than fish. As restorative 
food, shell-fish have long held a distinguished rank ; but 
beef, or a well dressed chop, is much better to recruit the 
strength and spirits. 

The wise and benevolent arrangements of Providence 



8oem to have designed that the products of difierent cli- 
mates should be most freely used, where most liberally 
provided. 

The climate of the Greenlander requires oil -and the fat- 
test substances, to sustain the human constitution ; no con- 
diment, nor scarcely a vegetable is required. ■ In warm cli- 
>mates, pepper and other spices are produced, and, no doubt, 
required, where the diet is chiefly vegetable, or meats newly 
killed ; and the stomach and system are relaxed by the heat. 
In our own climate, the season of the year, as well as the 
^ge andrconstitution of the individual, must be taken into 
the account. During the cold weather, more fat meats, and 
richer gravies, may be eaten, but few or no condiments, 
except a little salt, are §eeded. In summer, fish, and a 
large proportion of vegetable diet, should be used. Sauces 
made with cream and eggs, may be used ; and, if not too 
freely, doubtless, condiments will also be advantageous. 

Sometimes there is a muddy smell and taste attached to 
fresh water fish, which may be remedied by soaking them, 
after they have been thoroughly cleaned, in strong salt and 
water. Care should be taken that the fish be thoroughly 
cleaned before dressed ; but not washed beyond what is 
necessary for the cleaning-— by too much watering the fla- 
vor is diminished. Great care and punctuality are also 
necessary in cooking fish. They should be eaten as soon 
as done. If not sufliciently done, or if too much done, they 
are not good. They are the best the da^ after they are 
caught, except turbot, cod, &;c., for boiling or frying. They 
should be cleansed when first caught, well rinsed in cold 
water, and salt freely sprinkled over their inside. Sprinkle 
{)epper, if they are to be broiled, and place them where 
cool. When dished, the liver, roe, and chitterlings, should 
be placed so that the carver may observe them, and invite 
the guest-s to partake of them. 

136. To Boil Fish. 

To boil fresh fish, lay it on a strainer, or sew up the fish 
in a cloth, as it will otherwise be difficult to take it out of 
the pot without breaking. Put the fish in cold water, with 
the skin side down ; if put into boiling water, the outside 
gets cooked' too much, and breaks to pieces before the in- 



FISH. 67 

side is done. To ten pounds of fish add six spoonfuls of 
salt ; and a little vinegar should be put into the water to 
impart firmness. Boil the fish till you can easily draw out 
one of the fins — ^from fifteen to thirty minutes. Boiled fish 
should be served up with drawn butter or livei sauce. 

137. ToBroaFish, 

When fish is broiled, the bars of the gridiron shoidd be 
rubbed over with a Uttle butter. Then place your fish, skin 
side down — down, no mistake, and do not turn it till nearly 
done through. Save all your butter till the fish is dished — 
in this way you save the juices of the fish too. Fish should 
be broiled slowly. When put on the platter, fish should 
not be laid over each other, if it can be avoided. The top 
oaes will be made tender and moist by the steam, and will 
break to pieces. 

138. To Fry Fish. 

Fat from salt pork is best ; there should be enough to 
cover the fish, and hot and skimmed when the fish are laid 
in. After being cleaned and washed, fish for frying should 
be put into a cloth, to have it absorb the moisture ; make it 
quite dry, and rub a little flour over it, but no salt, if you 
wish to have it brown well. For six pounds of fish, fry 
four slices of salt pork ; when brown, take them^up, and if 
they do not make enough fat to fry the fish in, put in a little 
lard. When fried enough, take them up; and for good 
plain gravy, mix two or three teaspoonfuls of flour with a 
little water, and stir into the fat the fish was fried in ; put 
in a little btrtter, salt; and pepper ; if you wish to have the 
• gravy rich, add wine, catsup, and spices. Turn the gravy 
over the fish. 

139. To Fry Fresh Cod, Trout, and Perch. 

Prepare the fish according to receipt 138; slice the cod 
into pieces half or three-quarters of an inch thick; rub them 
in Indian meal, to prevent breaking ; fry thoroughly. 

Perch and trout are fried in the same way, except, in 
stead of rubbing in Indian meal, sprinkle with ^our, or dip 
in the white of an egg and bread cnimbs.

140. To Broa a Shad. 

Clean, wash, and split the shad, and wipe it dry ; sprin 
kle it with pepper and salt, place it over a very clear, slow 
lire, with tlie skin side down, so as to retain the juices, on 
a clean gridiron rubbed with lard ; turn it, when nearly 
done ; take up, and season with a generous piece of butter, 
salt and pepper. A smoke of corn cobs while it is broiling, 
improves it much 

141. To Roast a Shad. 

Fill the inside with good force meat ; sew it up ; tie it 
on a suitable board, (not pine ;) cover it with bread crumbs, 
a little salt, and pepper, and place it before the fire ; when 
done one side, turn it ; and when sufficiently done, pull out' 
the thread ; dish it ; and serve it out with drawn butter and 
parsley. 

142. To Bake a Shad, 

Nicely prepare a large fat fish ; put some force meat in the 
inside ; lay it full length in a pan, with a pint of water, a 
gill of red wine, one of mushroom catsup, a little salt, pep- 
per, vinegar, six cloves, and a few cloves of garlic ; stew 
gently, till the gravy is sufficiently reduced. Always lay 
tlfe fish on a fish slice, for the convenience of dishing with- 
out breaking it. When taken up, slide it carefully into the 
dish ; thicken the gravy with butter and brown flour, and 
turn over it. 

143. To Stuff and Bake Fish, 

Soak your bread in cold water till soft, drain it, mash 
fine and mix the bread with a spoonful of drawn butter, a 
little salt, and pepper, (two raw eggs make the dressing cut 
smoother,) and some spices, if liked. Fill, and sew up the 
fish ; put a teacup of water in your bake pan, and a little i 
butter, place in the fish, and bake about forty or fifty min- 1 
utes. Bass, shad, and fresh cod, are good fish for baking. ' 

144. Chowder. 

Fry broMOi several slices of pork, cut each fish into fivt 
01 six pieces ; flour, and place a layer of them in your pork 



FISH. G9 

fat ; sprinkle on a little pepper and salt ; add cloves, mace, 
and sliced onions ; if liked, lay on bits of the fried pork, 
and crackers soaked in cold water. Repeat this till you put 
in all the fish ; turn on water just sufficient to cover them, 
and put on a heated bake pan lid. After stewing about 
twenty minutes, take up the fis)i, and mix two teaspoonfuls 
of flour with a little water, and stir it into the gravy ; add- 
ing a little pepper and butter. A tumbler of wine, catsup, 
and spices will improve it. Cod and bass make the best 
chowder. Clams and black fish tolerably good. The hard 
part of the clam should be cut ofi* and rejected. 

145. CodJLsi. 

Fresh cod is good to broil, fry, or to make into a chow- 
der. It is rather dry for broiling. Salt cod should be 
soaked all night in water, tnth a glass of vinegar. It will 
make it like fresh fish. In the morning take it out ; put it 
in fresh water ; and place it three or four hours on a mode- 
rate fire, where it will keep warm without boiling — boiling 
hardens it ; take it up, and take ofif the skin ; serve it out 
with drawn butter. 

146. To Boil a CocPs Head and Shoulders. * 

Wash it clean ; tie it up, and dry it with a cloth ; salt 
your water well and put in a glass of vinegar ; when it 
boils, take oil* the scum ; put in the fish, and keep it boiling 
very briskly about thirty minutes. Parboil the milt, and 
roe ; cut in thin slices, fry, and serve them. Garnish with 
horse radish. For sauces — oysters, eggs, or drawn butter. 

147. To Roast Cod's Head and Shoulders, 

Prepare it as for boiling, taking out the gills and rubbing 
over it a little salt ; then, boiling all but enough for eating, 
take it up very carefully ; take off the skin ; set it before a 
brisk fire ; dredge it all over with flour, and baste it well 
with butter; when it begins to froth, strew over it some fine 
bread crumbs ; continue basting all the time to make it froth 
well. When of a fine light brown, dish it up, and garnish 
it with a lemon cut in slices, barberries, horse radish, fried 
ovsters, or a few small fish fried and laid around it. Cut

the liver and roe in slices, and lay over them a little of the 
lobster from the sauce pan, in lumps, and serve out the fi^ 

' 148. Halibut. 

This is fine, cut in slices, for frying and broiling, pep- 
pered and salted : the fin with the thick part, is good to boiL 

149. ^Black Fish. 
May be broiled, but are better boiled or fried. 

150. To Broil Herring. 

When they are to be used, take a few out of the brine , 
soak them an hour or two ; scale them nicely : pull off the 
gills, and the only entrail they have wiU come with them ; 
wash them clean, and hang them up to dry. When to be 
broiled, take half a sheet of white paper ; rub it over with 
butter ; put the herring in ; double the edges securely ; and 
broil without burning. 

151. Sturgeon. 

This fish is best fried, but good baked or broiled. Before 
baking it, boil fifteen minutes to extract the oily taste, put 
a quart of water into the pan for ten pounds of fish, and 
bake till it is tender. The part next to the tail is best for 
frying or baking 

Sturgeon is good cooked thus : cut it in slices about an 
inch thick, fry sonie slices of pork, when brown, take them 
up, and put in the sturgeon. When well browned, take up 
and stir in a little flour and water, mixed smoothly together. 
Season the gravy with pepper, salt, and catsup, stir in a 
little butter, and wine if liked, then put back the sturgeon, 
and let it stew a few minutes in the gravy. While the fish 
is cooking, make force meat balls of part of the sturgeon 
and salt pork ; fry and use them /or a garnish. 

152. To Boil Fresh Salmon. 

This fish needs more boiling in more water than any other 
fish. It is very unhealthy unless thoroughly done. 

Make your water quite salt, boil, skim, then put in your 



FISH 71 

salmon. Continue to skim off all that rises. Boil half a 
pound fifteen minutes ; lobster, egg, or drawn butter fur 
sauce. 

153. To Broil Fresh Salmon 

Slice it an inch and a half thick, dry in a clean cloth, 
and sprinkle a little salt over it ; warm the bars of your grid- 
iron, and rub them with a little lard ; lay the fish on, and 
set your gridiron over a clear but not very hot fire ; when 
nearly done, turn carefully, and do the other side. 

154. To Boil Mackerel, Trout, Perch, and Bass, 

If fresh, after cleaning it thoroughly, put into sufficient 
water to cover it, sprinkling^ in a little salt, (some add a 
glass of vinegar) and let it rather simmer than hoU, ^teen 
or more minutes. When done, take instantly from the 
water. 

Bass, Perch and Trout are boiled in the same manner. 
Use drawn butter -for boiled fish. 

155. To Broil Mackerel, Perch, Bass, or Troui. 

The same as " To Broil ShadJ' — No. 140. Fine shred 
parsley may likewise be added to seasoning of both, if liked; 
" drawn butter," is a good sauce for fish. 

156. To Boil Eels. 

Clean, cut off the heads, and dry them ; joint them into 
suitable length pieces, or coil them on your fish plate, boil 
them in salted water ; use drawn butter and parsley for 
sauce. 

157. To Broil Eels. 

After preparing them as for boiling, rub them with the 
yolk of an egg, strew over bread crumbs, minced parsley, 
pepper, salt, and sage ; butter them well, and lay them in a 
dripping pan to broil. Sauce as for boiled eels, or to the 
taste. 



72 FISH 



158. To Bake Eels. 

Joint and lay them in a deep dish, with bits of salt pork 
peppered and salted ; cover with pounded rusked bread, 
and t>ake thirty minutes. 

159. Fish Force Meat Balls. 

Chop fine a little raw fish with a little raw salt pork, mix 
it with an egg or two raw, a few bread crumbs, and season 
with pepper and spices, catsup, and to the taste ; mould into 
small balls and fry them till nicely browned. 

160. Fish Cakes. 
Take salt cod fish, or cold fresh fish boiled, mince it fine 
with potatoes, moistened with a little milk, and a bit of but- 
ter in it, mould into biscuit sized cakes, and fry them brown 
in butter, or pork fat. 

161. Lobsters and Crabs. 

Have your water boil, put in and boil them from thirty to 
forty five minutes. Boil six spoonfuls of salt to every four 
pounds of fish. When cold, break the shell, take out the 
meat, be cautious to extract the blue veins, and what is called 
the lady in the lobster ; these are very unhealthy. 

Eat cold ivith a dressing of vinegar, mustard, sweet oil, 
salt and cayenne ; or warm them up with a little water, vine- 
gar, salt, pepper ; and add a rich gravy and grated nutmeg, 
if liked. 

Lobsters look neatly dressed thus. Select the spawn 
and red chord, mash fine and rub them through a sieve, 
add a little butter and salt. Cut the lobsters into squares, 
and set them with the spawn, over a moderate fire ; when 
hot, take up and garnish with parsley. The spawn and 
chord are a nice garnish for any kind of fish ; eat but little 
of the lobster. 

The same process for Crabs as for Lobsters. 

162. Scollops. 

These are fine boiled, then fried; or pickled in the 
same way as oysters. Take them from the shells. Aftei 
boiling pick out the hearts and throw.; the rest away The

heart is the only part that is healthful. Flour and fry the 
hearts till brown, in butter. They are good stewed, in a 
little pepper, salt and butter. 

163. To Roast Clams, — Superior mode of cooking tkem. 

Select according to taste as to size, fthose with thin edges 
are the tenderest, never buy those or a thick edge,) wash 
them clean, place them flatwise in an old tin or iron pan, so 
as to save the liquor, and set the pan over a furnace of igni- 
ted coal. As they become sufficiently roasted, take them 
out singly, empty the liquor of each into your dish, then 
take out and add the clam, either cut in pieces or whole ; 
add butter, salt, and pepper ; other seasoning to taste. 
Clams and oysters generally agree with those who like 
them. Lobsters may form an exception. 

164. ^ot Clams. 

Wash and put the clams in a pot, with merely water 
enough, to prevent their burning. Heat till they open, take 
out 8tod warm them with a little of the liquor, butter, salt 
and pepper. To a slice or two of toasted bread, soaked in 
this clam liquor, add the clams. 

165. Clam Pancakes. 

Make a thick batter of flour and milk ; clam liquor does 
not make them so light as milk ; put to each pint of milk 
two eggs and a few clams ; the clams may be put in whole 
after being first stewed, or they may be only taken out of 
the shell and chopped fine. 

166. Long Clams, 

Select the largest, take them out of the shell, and broil 
them ; or they may be stewed ; season to the liking. 

167. To Stew Oysters, 

Rinse the bits of shell oflTthe oysters, stridn, then tmrn 
the liquor back, put them in a stew pan over the fire, let

theiii boil up, then turn them on to buttered toast ; butter, 
pepper and salt them. Some thicken the liquor with rolled 
cracker, and put in milk and cream ; others add a Utile 
walnut catsup, or vinegar, mace, or lemon peel. Oysters 
should be eaten hot. 

168. To Fry Oysters. 

Select the fattest of large size, dip them in beaten eggs, 
then in flour, or fine bread crumbs ; fry them in lard tiU of 
a light brown. They are a fine garnish for calves' head, 
fish, or most modem dishes. 

169. Oyster Pancakes. 

Mix together equal measures of oyster liquor and milk, 
to a pint of this mixture, put a pint of wheat flour, a few 
03rsters, two eggs, and a little salt ; drop by spoonfuls into 
hot lard, and fry till of a nice brown. 

170. Oyster Pie. 

Line a deep dish with pie-crust, fill with dry pieces of 
bread, and cover it with puff paste, bake either in a bake 
pan or quick oven till it is a light brown ; by this time have 
the oysters just stewed, take ofi* the upper crust, take out the 
pieces of bread, put in the oysters, season with salt, pepper, 
and butter ; walnut catsup : replace the upper crust. 

171. Scolloped Oysters. 

Pound fine, rusked bread or crackers, butter scollop 
shells or tins, sprinkle on the bread stuff, put in a layer of 
oysters, a bit of butter, salt, pepper, and a little of the oyster 
liquor ; add another layer of crumbs, and oysters, and so on 
till the shells are filled, placing a layer of the bread stuff 
on the top, bake them till of a light brown in a Dutch oven. 

172. Puddings. 

Be particular to always wash the salt from butter, where 
sugar constitutes one ingredient of any compound ; or whfire 
drawn butter is to be used to butter any mould for bakinf - 



,f 



P17DDING9, 75 

if not, the article baked will have an unsavory salt taste on 
its outside. 

Stone and cut in two your raisiijs ; sift a little flour over 
theniy stir them in the flour and take them out free from 
lumps — the flour which adheres to them will prevent their 
uniting, or settling to the bottom in a mass. Or when you 
bake puddings, by waiting till the pudding begins to thicken 
in the oven, before you add the fruit, the fruit will not sink. 
Use fresh eggs — stale eggs will not beat well. Always 
separate the yolks from the whites ; when they are to be 
mixed with milk, let the milk cool after boiling, or the eggs 
ivill poach ; and set the milk on the fire only a few minutes, 
to take out the raw taste of the egg, stirring it continually. 
Wash your currants in several waters, till perfectly clean. 
Pick over and dry them well ; or they will adhere. 

Put your almonds in hot water, till you can blanch, or 
skin them ; always pound them with orange or rose water, 
to prevent their oiling. 

Put in cream, if used, just before the mixture is ready — 
much beating will decompose it. 

Before a pudding or cake is begun, (for the above direc- 
tions will apply as well to cake as to puddings) have every 
ingredient ready. The article is injured when the process 
is retarded by neglect in the preparations. Have the oven 
in a proper state ; and the paste ready in the dishes or 
moulds for such things as require a paste. When but a 
single egg, or two, are to be used, cooks often think it use- 
less to beat them : mistake ! unless they are made light be- 
fore used, eggs are an injury. • It is well to mix the pudding 
an hour or two before it is boiled or baked. 

Make your pudding bags of German sheeting : a cloth 
less thick will admit water, and deteriorate the pudding. 
Before turning in, or bagging your pudding, dip the cloth in 
water, wring it out, and flour the inside. When bagged, tie 
tight, leaving sufficient room for expansion by swelling. 
Flour and Indian puddings require much room. Put them 
in a pot of boiling water, placing an old pla^e on the bottom, 
to prevent the bag from sticking to it. Turn the bag over, 
after having been in the pot a few minutes, to prevent the 
pudding's settling and becoming heavy. Keep sufficient 
water in the pot to cover the pudding, and not let the pot 



1 



76 PUDDINGS. 

Stop boiling one second — ^if so, the pudding will not be thm 
thing. A tea-kettle of boiling water should be at hand to 
turn in as the water boils away. When the pudding is 
done, dip the bag in cold water a moment; the pudding will 
then readily turn out. 

173. Virginia Chicken Pudding. 

Beat ten eggs perfectly light, add tc^them a quart of rich 
milk, four ounces of drawn butter, pepper, and salt ; sdr in 
sufficient flour to make a thin batter ; then take four young 
chickens, clean them neatly, cut -o^ the legs, wings &c. 
Put them all in a sauce pan, with salt and water, and a bun- 
dle of thyme and parsley ; boil them till nearly doQc, then 
take out the chicken and put it in the batter, and pour the 
batter in a deep dish and bake it. White grayy for sauce. 

174. Almond Pudding, 

Shell half a pound of sweet almonds, and pour scalding 
water over them, to make them peel. As they become cool, 
pour on more boiling water, till they are all blanched. 
Blanch also one ounce of peach meats, or bitter almonds, 
throw them into a bowl of cold water as you blanch them. 
Take them out, one by one ; wipe them dry on a clean 
towel ; lay them on a plate ; pound them singly in a marble 
iQortar, till of a fine paste, adding a few drops of rose-water 
as you pound, to prevent their oiling : — Pound alternately, 
a sweet and then a bitter almond, to mix them well, and 
see you. make them perfectly fine and smooth ; — ^they are 
improved by being prepared day before they are wanted 
for use. ♦ 

Stir four ounces of butter and four ounces of powdered 
white sugar to a cream, and add gradually, a spoonful of 
mixed rose-water, brandy and wine. 

Beat the whites of six eggs, till they stand ahme ; stir 
them and the almonds alternately into the bntter and sugar, 
and thoroughly mix the whole. Butter a soup plate ; have 
ready ^ puff paste; (see receipt for making it) place it on 
ilie plate, trim and notch it; then put in y^ur pudding- 
lake about half an hour, in a moderate oven ; and grate loa' 
sugar over it.

addition of two or three eggs, and a little chopped suet. 
Boil three hours: — if six, the better — some cooks t>oil eight 
or nine hours. When so long, seven hours of the boiling 
should be given the day before the pudJing is to be eaten — 
thb is good fried when cold.

flour the raisins. Bake about an hour and a half, or till 
done : it is excellent when cold. 

216. Apple Dumplings. 

With a narrow knife, take out the core of pared, tart, 
mellow apples ; and fill the place of the core, with sugar ; 
roll out some good pie crust about two thirds of an inch 
thick, and cut it into pieces of just suflicient size to roll the 
apple in. Lay an apple on each piece, and inclose it en- 
tirely, tying up in a smooth thick piece of cloth that has 
been well floured. Put in a pot of boiling water, and boil* 
the dumplings an hour without intermission. They will 
otherwise be hard. 

Eat them with butter and sugar, or with pudding sauce. 

217. Plain Fritters. 

Stir a quart of milk gradually into a pound of flour ; add 
seven well beaten eggs, and a teaspoonful of salt. Drop 
them by the spoonful into hot lard, and fry them of a light 
brown. They are the less greasy, fried in just suflicicnt 
fat to keep them from sticking to the pan, but the lighter 
fried in a great deal of fat ; serve out with liquid pudding 
sauce

Mix a pint and a half of flour with a pii t of milk ; stir in 
six well beaten eggs ; add half a nutmeg ; then two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt, and a pint of cream ; stir the whole just 
enough to intermix the cream, then fry in small cakes ; tho 
addition of a few tender apples chopped fine improves the 
fritters. 

219. Spanish Fritters. 

Mix early in the morning a quart of flour with a well 
beaten egg, a spoonful of yeast, and milk enough to make 
it a little sofler than muffin dough, adding a little salt. 
When well risen, work in two spoonfuls of drawn butter ; 
make the mixtiure into balls, the size of a walnut, and fry 
them till of a light brown, in boiling lard ; eat them with 
molasses, wine and sugar, or a sauce prepared. 

220. Mock Oysters of Green Com, 

Mix a pint of grated green com, with three spoonfuls ot 
milk, a teacup of flour, half a teacup of drawn butter, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, and one egg. 
Drop by the spoonful into hot butter ; let the cakes fry from 
eight to ten minutes. 

221. Indian Com Cake, 

Make a thick batter of a quart of sour, or butter milk, 
two of sifted Indian meal, a little salt, and two teaspoonfuls 
of saleratus ; if a little cream the better. Bake an hour 
in deep pans. If sour milk be wanting, boil sweet, and 
turn on the meal. When cool, put in three eggs to a quart 
of meal, salting to the taste. 

222. Pastry and Pies, 

Take nine pounds of flour, three of butter, one of lard, 
and three pints of cold water. Spread six pounds of the 
flour on the board in a ring. Put the lard in the ring, and 
work it into the flour with water, putting in the water very 
gradually, till the six pounds of flour are worked in. Roll

up the paste, working in all the scraps on the board until 
the paste is smooth. From the remaining three pounds of 
flour sprinkle the board and roll out the paste. Repeat this 
till "lis quite smooth. Divide the butter into two parts. 
Flour each part. Put one part in the end of the long sheet 
of crust Giye it a roll or two ; then put in the other part, 
in the same manner, and roll up the whole like a scroll ; 
roll it till very light, turning it on the pin at each roll ; then 
fold it together like a sheet four times. When folded, cut 
into strips the width of the pie plate, and. roll out thin enough 
for the pie, and roll it over the pin ; then unroll it over the 
line of plates. Wet the lower crust, which should be thin, 
when on the plate, before filling. Then after filling, roll 
out the upper crust on both sides till even ; and from the 
pin, unroll, and spread oVer the line of plates, leaving the 
paste half an inch thick. 

The handsomest ornamental edging for pie or pudding, is 
the cutting into large squares, the edge of the crust, and 
folding over one comer of it ; the lid of the pie should be 
pricked, or a lip cut in the top. 

223. Common Paste for Pies, — No. 1. 

To make one large pie, or two small ones, take a pound 
and a half of sifled flour, and twelve ounces of washed but- 
ter. Sifl the flour into a pan. Divide the butter into two 
equal parts. Cut up one half into the flour as small as pos- 
sible. Mix it thoroughly with the flour, wetting it gradu- 
ally with a little cold water. Strew some flour over your 
paste board, take the lump of paste out of the pan, flour your 
rolling pin, and roll out the paste into a large sheet, rolling 
from you. Stick the sheet over with the remaining butter 
in small pieces placed at equal distances. Sprinkle on a 
little flour, fold up the sheet, flour it lightly, and roll it out 
again. Then fold it up, cut it in two, or in four, according 
to the size of your pies. Roll it out into round sheets the 
size of your pie plates, now pressing rather harder on the 
rolling pin. Butter your pie plates, place the under crust, 
and trim the edge. Fill the dish with what is to constitute 
the pile, and put on the lid, pricking some holes, or cutting 
a small slit in the top. Crimp the edges with a sharp knife.

224. Common Pastry. — No. 2. 

For a good common pie-crust, calculate half a pound of 
shortening to a pound of flour ; or the same proportion as in 
No. 1. If you wish a very short crust, instead of one half, 
take three quarter» of the weight of shortening that you take 
of flour. 

Pie-crust looks the handsomest made wholly of lard, but 
it does not taste so well as to have a proportion of butter 
Beef shortening mixed with butter, makes good plain pie- 
cnist, in the cold season. Rub half of the shortening with 
two thirds of the flour ; and to each pound of flour put a tea- 
spoonful of salt. When the shortening is completely mixed 
with the flour, add just enough cold water to make it suffi- 
ciently moist to roll out easily. Divide the crust into tWo 
equal portions — ^lay one of them by for the upper crust ; roll 
out the other quite thin, flouring your rolling board and pin, 
that the crust will not stick to them, and line your pie plates, 
previously buttering them ; fill your plates with what is to 
constitute the pie ; roll out the upper crust as thin as possi- 
ble ; spread on the reserved shortening, or t^e other half, and 
sprinkle over it the other portion, or third of the flour Roll 
up your upper crust, and cut it into as many pieces as you 
have pies to cover. Roll each one out more than half an 
inch thick, and cover the pies : trim off the edges neatly 
with a knife, and press down the crust ; round the edge of 
the plate with a jagging iron, to prevent the escape of the 
juices while baking. Pastry should be baked, in a quick 
oven to be nice. In cold weather, warm, but do not melt, 
the shortening. The crust will not be flaky if you do. 

225. Common Family Pastry. — No. 3. 

Take one quart of sifled flour, two teacups of lard, and 
one of butter. Reserve a handful of flour, and the cup of 
butter for your upper crust. Mix the lard well with the 
flour by rubbing them together with sufficient^water to mois- 
ten the mass, as before directed : Lay by one half of it 
for the upper crust ; and line the bottom of the pie plates 
and All them with the pie-materials, according to former 
directions. Afler filling the plates — ^roundin^r them to

heapiug fall, where the ingredients admit of it ; use the re- 
served butter and handful of flour for the iqpper crust, and 
V ])lace it, when shaped, on the top. 

226. Puff Paste. 

To make puff paste for one soup plate pie, for four small 
shells ; (or for two puddings :) take ten ounces of sifted 
flour, eight ounces of best fresh butter washed, and a little 
cold water. Sift the flour through a fine hair sieve into a 
broad deep pan ; lay aside one quarter of it, on a comer 
of your paste board, to roll and sprinkle with ; after washed, 
squeeze the butter hard with your hands, and shape it into 
a round ball ; divide it into four equal parts ; lay them one - 
side of your paste board, and have on hand a glass of cold 
|l water. Cut one of the four pieces of butter into the pan as 

small as possible ; wet the contents of the pan gradually, ^^jl^ 
with a very little water, (too much will make it tough) and H^m 
mix it well with the point of a large case knife ; do not touch '^^ 
it with the hand. When the dough shapes into a lump, 
sprinkle some of the flour you laid aside on the middle of 
the board, and lay the dough upon it, turning it out of the 
pan with the knife. ^Flour the rolling pin, and the lump of 
-- paste ; roll the paste out thin, quickly, and evenly, pressing 
on the rolling pin very lightly ; then take the second of the 
four pieces of butter, and with the point of your knife, stick 
in little bits at equal distances all over the sheet of paste. 
Sprinkle over some flour, and fold up the paste. Flour 
the paste board and rolling pin again ; and throw a little 
flour on the paste, and roll it out a second time. Stick the 
third piece of butter all over the sheet, in little bits. Throw 
on some flour, fcdd up the paste, sprinkle a little more flour 
on the dough, and on the rolling pin, and roll it out a third 
time, always pressing lightly. Stick it oyer with the fourth 
and last piece of butter. 

Throw on a little more flour, fold up the paste, and then 
roll it out in a large round sheet. Cut oflf the sides, so as 
to make the sheet of a square form, and lay the slips of 
dough upon the square sheet. Fold it up with the small 
pieces of trimmings inside. Score and notch it a little with 
the knife ; lay it on a plate and set it away in a cool place, 
bui not where it will freeze, as that will make it heavy.

PASTRV AND PIES. 91 

Having made the paste, prepare and mix your pie or pud- 
ding. When the mixture is finished, fetch out your paste, 
flour your board and rolling pin, and roll out your paste 
with a short quick stroke, pressing the rolling pin rather 
harder than while you were putting the butter in. If the 
paste rises in blisters, it will be light, unless spoiled in 
baking. 

Cut the sheet in halves, fold both separately, and roll out 
each once more, in round sheets, the size of your plates, 
pressing on rather harder, but not too hard. Roll the sheets 
thinnest in the middle, and thickest at the edges. If inten- 
ded for puddings, lay the sheets in buttered soup plates, and 
trim them evenly round the edges. If the edges do not ap- 
pear thick enough, take the trimmings, put them all together, 
roll them out, and having cut them in slips the width of the 
rim of your plate, lay them all round to make the paste * 
thicker at the edges, joining them nicely and evenly, as 
every patch or crack will appear distinctly when baked. 
Notch the rim, handsomely with a very sharp knife. Fill 
the dish with the mixture of the pudding, and bake it in a 
moderate oven. The paste should be of a light brown color. 
If the oven is too slow, it will be soft and clammy : if too 
quick, it will not have time to rise so high as it ought. 

227. Confectioner* s Pastry. 

Take five parts of flour to four of shortening ; or weigh 
out a pound stnd a quarter of flour, and a pound of butter. 
Rub one-third of the butter with two-thirds of the flour, ad- 
ding a teaspoonful of salt. When the butter is thoroughly 
mixed with the flour, add one beaten egg, and cold water, 
to moisten enough to roll out. Sprinkle part of the reserv- 
ed flour on a board ; cut the butter into small pieces, and 
roll out the pieces as thin as possible. In order to roll them 
very thin, you must sprinkle a great deal of the flour on the 
moulding board and rolling pin. Lay the butter, as fast as 
rolled out, on a floured plate, each piece by itself. 

Roll out the pastry as thin as it can be rolled ; cover it 
with the rolled butter; sprinkle on part of the reserved' 
flour, and roll the crust up. Continue to roll out the crust, 
and put on the reserved butter and flour, till the whole is

used ; iiow roll it out lightly, about half an inch thick, for 
the upper crust or rim to your pies. Use plain pie crust 
for the lining of your plates or the under crust. Puff pas* 
try should be baked in a quick oven till of a light brown, to 
he nice. If it browns before the fruit in the pie is suffi- 
ciently baked, cover it with thick papers. 

228. Tart Paste. 

Rub into eight ounces of flour, six of butter, and a spoon- 
ful of powdered sugar. Form it into a thick paste with hoi 
water. 

229. Short Paste far Fruit Pies. 

R|^b into twelve ounces of flour, four ounces of lard and 
a spoonful of powdered sugar. Form it into a paste with

231. Tomato Pie. 

Pick green tomatoes, pour boiling water over them, and 
let them remain a few minutes ; then strip ofl* the skin, cut 
the tomatoes in slices, and put them in deep pie plates. 
Sprinkle a little ginger and some sugar .over them in several 
layers. Lemon juice^ and the grated peel, improve the pie. 
Cover the pies with a thick crust, and bake them slowly 
about an hour.

Parboil a beef's heart, or tongue, or a fresh piece of beef. 
When cold, chop very fine two pounds of the lean ; chop 
as fine as possible, two pounds of the inside of beef's suet, 
and mix the meat and the suet together, adding a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Take four pounds of pippin apples, pared, cored 
and chopped fine, two pounds of raisins stoned and i/;hop- 
ped, and two pounds of currants, picked, washed and dried, 
and mix the fruit with the suet and meat. Add two pounds 
of powdered sugar, two grated nutmegs, half an ounce of 
powdered cinnamon, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, a 



PASTRY AND PIES. 93 

. quarter of an ounce of mace, and the grated peel and juice 
of two large oranges ; and wet the whole with a quart of 
white wine, a quart of brandy, and a wineglass of rose-wa- 
ter, mixing them well together. 

Make a pasta, allowing for each pie eight ounces of but- 
ter and twelve ounces of sifted 6our. Lay a sheet of paste 
all over a soup plate ; fill it with mince meat, laying slips 
of citron on the top, in the proportion of half a pound for 
the entire mixture. Roll out a sheet of paste for the lid of 
the pie ; put it on, and crimp the edges with a knife ; prick 
holes in the lid, and bake half an hour in a brisk oven. 

Meat will keep good for pies, several months, if kept in 
a cool dry place, and prepared as follows. To a pound of 
meat chopped fine, and four ounces of suet, put an ounce 
of cinnamon, an ounce of mace, a quarter of an ounce of 
cloves, and two teaspoonfuls of salt, add, if liked, eight oun- 
ces of currants, eight of raisins, and four of citron. Add 
too, a tumbler of brandy or wine, three spoonfuls of molas- 
ses, and sugar enough to make it quite sweet. Put all in 
a stone pot, and cover it with a paper wet in brandy. In 
using it, take equal weights of meat and apples pared and 
chopped fine. If not seasoned enough, add to the taste. 
If the apples are not tart, put in lemon juice or cider. 

233. Plain Mince Pie, 

Neat's tongue and feet make the best mince pies. The 
shank is good.- Boil the meat till very tender, take it up, 
clean it from the bones and gristle, chop it fine, mix it with 
an equal weight of tart apples chopped fine. If the meat is 
lean, put in a little butter or suet. Moisten the whole .with 
cider ; new, if you have good ; sweeten it to the taste with 
sugar and a little molasses — seasoning with salt, cinnamon, 
cloves, and mace. Make the pies on fieet plates, with 
holes in the upper crust, and bake from thirty to forty &ve 
minutes. 

234. To Make Mince Meat for Pies

sins, one of good brown sugar, one of nicely chopped suet, 
one of cider, and a pint of brandy ; add a teaspoonful of 
pounded mace, of nutmeg, and of cloves ; and mix all well 
together. When pies are wanted,' take as much of this 
mixture as may be necessary, adding to each quart of it a 
teaspoonful of pepper, and one of salt ; this much improves 
the flavor, and can be easier mixed with a little than with 
the whole mass. Cover the moulds with paste ; put in the 
mince meat ; cover the top with fine slips of citron ; and 
crown the whole with a lid garnished around with paste 
cut in fanciful shapes. Bake from thirty to forty minutes. 
They are best hot ; but may be eaten either cold or hot. 
The mince meat may be potted, and kept for use as needed 



235. Apple Pie. 

Green apples, when small, are nice stewed whole, with 
the skins on, and strained when soft, and sweetened. When 
large enough, pare, quarter, and core the apples. If the 
apples are not ripe, stew them with barely water enough to 
prevent their burning. Sweeten them, when soft, and sea- 
son them to the taste. Ripe apples are best for pies, not 
to be stewed. 

Line your plates with a thin paste, fill them, and cover 
them with a thick crust, and bake from thihy to forty min- 
utes. When baked enough, carefully remove the upper 
crust by loosening its edge with a broad knife and sliding 
it on to a plate ; put a piece of butter of nutmeg size into 
each pie ; sweeten it to your taste ; and, if the apples are 
not sufficiently acid, squeeze in a little lemon juice ; and 
season with lemon peel, nutmeg, and rose-water. Replace 
the crust. 

Apples quartered, without paring, and stewed soft in new 
cider and molasses, make good plain pies. Strain the ap- 
ples, after stewing, and season with nutmeg and cinnamon. 
If made quite sweet, apples thus stewed, strained, and 
seasoned, will keep good several months. Turn boiling 
water on to dried apples, enough to cover them, and stew 
them till quite soft ; if they are not sufficiently tart, turn in 
«our cider when they are partly done. Stew with the ap- ,

p]es a little orange peel to flavor them. Season them, when 
soft, with sugar and nutmeg, and strain them if you wish. 

236. Rice Pie. 

Turn a quart of boiling water on ten spoonfuls of clean 
rice ; boil till very soil, take it from the fire, and add a quart 
of cold milk, five eggs, a nutmeg, a little salt, sugar to the 
taste, and strain it through a sieve. May add a few rai- 
sins. Bake from thirty to forty minutes, in deep plates, 
with a Uning and rim of paste. 

237. Peach Pie. 

Select mellow^ juicy peaches ; wash and place them in 
a deep pie plate lined with paste ; strew a thick layer of su* 
gar on each of peaches, adding a spoonful of water, and a 
sprinkling of flour over the top of each layer ; cover with a 
thick crust ; and bake about an hour. The prussic acid of 
the stone imparts a most agreeable flavor to the pie. Stew 
peaches that are hard, before making them into pies. Also, 
stew dried peaphes soft, and sweeten them ; and give them 
no other spice than a few of the meats, blanched and 
pounded £ne in a little rose-water. 

238. A Plain Custard Pie, 

Boil a quart of milk with six peach leaves or with a lem- 
on rind. When the milk is sufficiently flavored, strain, and 
place it where it will boil. Smoothly mix a &>j>ronful of 
flour with two of milk, and stir the mixture into the boiling 
milk. Stirring it constantly, let it boil one minute. Take 
it from the Are ; put in three well-beaten eggs as soon as 
cool ; sweeten to the taste ; pour it into deep pie plates, and 
immediately bake the pies in a quick oven. 

239. Apple Custards. 

Pare, quarter, and core six mellow, tart apples ; set them, 
with six spoonfuls of water, in a pan, on a few coals ; and 
as they soften, turn them into a pudding dish, and sprinkle 
on sugar. Mix eight eggs, beaten with rolled brown sugar, 
with Uiree pints of milk ; grate in half a nutmeg, and turn 
the whole over the apples. Bake about twenty-five minutes

241. Marlborough Tarts, 

Quarter,* and stew very tender, juicy tart apples. To a 
teacup of the pulp, rubbed through a sieve, put the same 
measure of sugar, the same of wine, half a teacup of melted 
butter, the juice and grated rind of a lemon, a tumbler of 
milk, four eggs, and half a nutmeg. Mix all the ingre- 
dients well together, and turn into deep pie plates that are 
lined with pastry, with a rim of puff paste round the edge. 
Bake the tarts about thirty minutes. 

242. Lemon Tart, 

Grate the yellow part of the rinds of three lemons ; add 
the juice of one, six whites and twelve yolks of eggs, twelve 
ounces of sugar, and twelve of butter. Bake in a plate, the 
bottom lined with a paste. 

243. Tart Pie, 

Cranberries, sour apples, and peaches, make good tarts. 
Stew them, and strain when soft. Add a little lemon juice 
to peach tarts, unless the peaches are sour ; and brown su- 
gar and lemon peel to the taste ; put a well-beaten egg in 
each pie to make it cut smooth ; and bake on shallow 
plates, with an under crust and rim of pastry. Ornament 
with fine strips of paste ; and when the crust is done, caU 
the pie done. 

244. Rhubarb Pie, 

Strip off the skin, and slice thin, the tender stalks of 
rhubarb. Put the rhubarb in deep plates lined with pie 
crust, with a thick layer of sugar to each layer of rhubarb. 



PASTRY AND PIES. 97 

A litde grated lemon peel may be added Place over the 
top a thick crust ; press it tight round the edge of the plate, 
and perforate it with a fork, that the crust may not burst 
while baking, and let the juices of the pie escape. Bake 
about one hour in a slow oven. Rhubarb pie must not be 
quick baked. Some stew rhubarb before making it into 
pies, but it is best without stewing. 

245. Pumpkin Pie, 

Halve, seed, rinse, slice into small strips, and stew the 
pumpkin over a gentle fire, in just water enough to prevent 
burning to the bottom of the pot. After stewed soft, pour off 
the water, and steam the pumpkin about eighteen minutes, 
over a slow fire, seeing that it does not burn. Take it off, 
and strain it, when cool, through a sieve. Put to a quart 
of the pumpkin, twelve eggs and two quarts of milk, if you 
wish the pies veiy rich. Put to a quart of the pumpkin, 
three eggs and one quart of milk, if you wish them plain. 
If very plain, put to a quart, one egg^ with a spoonful of 
flour, and very little milk. The more thinned the pumpkin, 
the greater ike number of eggs required. Sweeten the 
pumpkin to the taste, with sugar beaten with the egg, and 
very little molasses. Lemon peel, nutmeg, and ginger, are 
good seasoning for the pies. As they require a hot oven, 
have the pumpkin scalding hot at the time of putting it into 
the plates, to prevent the rim of the pies getting burnt be- 
fore the inside is sufficiently baked. Bake as soon as the 
plates are filled, to prevent the crust becoming clammy. 
The fewer the eggs in the pies, the longer the time re- 
quired to bake them. Pumpkin may be kept several months 
in cold weather, by making it, after stewed, very sweet, 
and strong of ginger, and &en scalding it well. Keep it 
in a cool place, in a stone jar. Take out what you want 
at any time, and put to it the milk and eggs. 

246. Lenum Pie. 

Take three fresh good sized lemons ; the grated yellow 
of the rind and the juice, two well-beaten eggs, two spoon- 
fuls of flour, and a pint of molasses ; mix aU well together. 
Line three large sized dining plates with a paste ; put in a

tluD layer of the lemon ; add a second good paste ; thcu 
put in another thin layer of lemon ; add a third layer for the 
top; and bake till the crust is done. See receipt for ^ Lem- 
on Pudding or Lemon Pie" No. 183. 

247. Grape Pie. 

When green and tender, grapes make a good pie. Stew 
and strain the grapes, unless very small, to separate the 
seeds, before making them into pies, and sweeten them to 
the taste. They need no spice. If made into a pie with- 
out stewing, put to each layer of grapes a spoonful of water, 
after a thick layer of sugar. 

248. Currant and Gooseberry Pte, 

Currants and gooseberries may be used for pies, when 
ripe ; but tJief'ure best just before turning red, and of full 
growth. Mixed with ripe mulberries or raspberries, cur- 
rants make fine pies. As the juice of the currants is apt 
to run out while the pies ar6 baking, and leave the fruit dry, 
and not sufficiently sweet, scald in the sugar before they 
are baked. Stew them on a moderate fire, with twelve 
spponiUs of water to two quarts of currants ; as soon as 
they begin to crack, put in the sugar and scald it in, a few 
minutes. If baked without stewing, add a thick layer of 
sugar to each of fruit — ^four ounces of sugar to a pint of 
currants. Green currant pies are good sweetened with 
sugar and molasses mixed. 

249. Fruit Pies in Variety, 

In making pies from ripe summer fruit, raspberries, black- 
berries, damsons, cherries, &c., always take a deep plate, 
line it wjlh paste, place in the middle an inverted teacup, 
and fill the plate with fruit Brown sugar and spice to the 
taste. The cup thus placed, will receive the juice, which 
would otherwise escape at the edges of the pie. It will 
settle under the cup ; which remove on cutting the pie.

Take five well-beaten eggs, and a pint of sweet thick 
cream; beat with the eggs sufficient good dry sugar to make 
the cream very sweet; add seeded raisins; and season

milky. 

252. Connecticut Thanksgiving Chicken Pie. 

In sufficient water to prevent burning, stew old notyoung 
fowls, jointed, all but tender enough for the table. Pour 
all into a dish, and season with salt and pepper to the taste. 
When about cold, place the parts in your pudding dish, 
lined with a thin common paste, adding about half a pound 
of butter to three pounds of fowl, in alternate layers. 
Take more of the paste ; roll it nine times, studding it each 
time with butter, (it must be made very rich ;) be careful to 
roll out, each time, from you, and to roll up towards you, 
leaving it, at least, an inch thick. Add the upper crust ; 
cut a lip in it ; and ornament it with some of the reserved 
paste, having first lightly sprinkled the chickens with fiour, 
after almost filling the dish with the liquor in which the 
chickens were stewed. Pin tight around the rim of the 
dish a cloth bandage, to prevent the escape of the juices ; 
and bake from an hour to an hour and a half, in a quick 
oven. If the top biurns, lay a paper over it. 

253. Common Chicken Pie. 

Prepare the chickens, and place them in a deep pudding 
dish, as by preceding rule. Put three or four slices of pork 
to each layer of chicken. Add some of the liquor in which 
they were boiled, and two ounces of butter, in small pieces. 
Sprinkle over a little flour ; cover with a nice crust, orna- 
menting with the same ; and bake one hour, in a quick oven

100 CUSTARDB. 

25ai. Riehmsnd Mince Pie. 232. 

To two pounds lean beef, two suet, two raisins, two ap« 
pies— -chopped fine — add four ounces allspice, two clores, 
and one of mace, with one quart of wine and one of brandy. 
Moisten with sweet cider when preparing it for the paste. 

254. Almond Custard, No. 1. 

Take one pint of rich milk, one of cream, half a pound 
of shelled sweet almonds, two ounces of shelled bitter al- 
monds, four spoonfuls of rose-water, four ounces of white 
sugar, the yolks of eight eggs, and a little oil of lemon ; 
blanch the almonds and pound them to a paste, mixing the 
rose-water gradually wiUi them ; powder the sugar, and 
beat the yolks till very light ; mix the milk and cream to- 
gether, and stir in gradually, the sugar, the pounded al- 
monds, and the beaten yolks. Stir the whole very hard. 
Put the mixture into a skillet or sauce pan, and set it in a 
heated stove, or on a charcoal furnace. Stir it one way 
till it becomes thick, but take it off before it curdles. Set 
it away to get cold. Take half the whites of the eggs ; 
beat them well, adding a little powdered sugar, and a few 
drops of oil of lemon. . Put the custard into a glass bowl 
or dish, and heap the frothed white of an egg upon it. Or- 
nament the top with nonpareils, or sugar sand. Or put the 
custard in small cups, piling some froth on each. 

255. Almond Custard, No. 2. 

Blanch, and pound fine, four ounces of almonds, with a 
spoonful of rose-water ; boil them four or five minutes in a 
quart of milk, with sugar enough to sweeten the milk ; re« 
move it from the fire ; when lukewarm, atir in the well- 
beaten yolks of eight eggs, and the whites of four ; set all 
on the fire and stir constantly till it thickens. Then take 
it up ; stir it till partly cooled, and turn it into cups. Set 
the cups into a pan of cold water, if you wish to have the 
custards cool quick. As soon as tne water gets warm 
change it. Just before the custards are to be eaten, beat 
t^e reserved whites of the other four eggs to a froth, and 
pile them on the top of the custards. 

256. Soft Custard. 

Take a quart of cream or milk, the yolks only of sixteen 
e^tgs, six ounces of powdered white sugar half an ounce 



CUSTARDS. 101 

•jf cinnamon broken in small pieces, a large handful of 
peach leaves, or half an ounce of peach kernels, or bitter 
almonds, broken in pieces, a spoonful of rose-water, and a 
nutmeg ; and boil in the milk, the cinnamon, and the peach 
keniels or leaves. When it has boiled, set it away till cold. 
Strain it through a sieve, soon as cold, to clear it of the 
cinnamon, leaves, &c., and stir into it gradually, the sugar, 
spice, and rose-water. Stir by degrees the sixteen yolks, 
beaten very light, into the milk, which must be quite cold, 
or the eggs will make it curdle. Put the custards into cups 
and set them in a baking pan half filled with water. When 
baked, grate some nutmeg over each, and ice them. Make 
the icing of the whites of eight eggs, a heaping teaspoon- 
ful of powdered loaf sugar, and siif drops of essence of 
lemon, beaten all together till it stands alone. Pile up 
some of the icing on the top of each custard. 

257. Rennet Custards, — See " To Make Rennet,'* 

Take half a pint of cream and a quart of new milk mixed, 
four ounces of powdered white sugar, a large glass of white 
wine in which an inch of washed rennet has been soaked, 
and a nutmeg ; mix together, in a pitcher, the milk, cream, 
and sugar ; stir in the wine ; and pour the mixture into 
your custard cups. Set them in a warm place near the 
fire, till they become a firm curd. Then set them on ice, 
or in a cold place. Grate nutmeg over them. 

258. Cream Custards. 

Sweeten a pint of cream with powdered white sugar, and 
set it on a few coals. When hot, mix with it white wine 
till it curdles. Add rose-water, or essence of lemon, to the 
taste, and turn it into cups. 

Another very nice way of making custards, is to mix a 
pint of milk with a pint of cream, five beaten eggs, three 
spoonfuls of sugar, and two of flour, adding nutmeg to the 
taste, then baking in cups or in pie plates, in a quick oven. 

259. Boiled Custards. 

Set your milk on the fire, and let it boil up. Remove 
it from the fire, and let it cool. Beat for each quart of milk, 



102 CAK£8, GINGE&BREAD, AND NUTS. 

if liked rich, the yolks and half the whites of six eggs, with 
three spoonfuls of rolled sugar. Stir them into the milk 
when cool. For very plain custards, four eggs are suffi- 
cient for a quart of milk. Season the custard with nutmeg 
or rose-water ; set it on a few coals ; and stir it constantly, 
till it thickens and becomes scalding hot. Remove it from 
the fire before boiling. Stir it a few minutes, and turn it 
into cups. Beat to a stiff froth the reserved whites of the 
eggs, and pile them on the top of the custards just before 
they are to be eaten. 

260. Mottled Custards. 

Stir the beaten yolks of six eggs into a quart of boiling 
milk ; one minute af^er the yolks have set so as to be thick, 
stir in the whites well beaten, w^ith three spoonfuls of su- 
gar, if liked very sweet. Season with rose-water, or essence 
of lemon ; stir till it becomes lumpy and thick, and then 
turn it into cups. 

261. Milk Cvstards. 

Make a quart of milk quite hot, that it may not whey 
when baked ; let it stand till cold ; then mix with it, eight 
eggs ; sweeten with loaf sijgar, and flavor with essence of 
lemon and rose-water. Fill the custard cups ; put on the 
covers ; and set them in the oven, in a dripping pan half 
filled with boiling water. When the water has boiled ten 
or fifteen minutes, take out a cup, and if the custard is the 
consistency of jelly, it is sufficiently done. 

262. Cakes, Gingerbread, Nuts, i^c* 

General directions. — Cake, to be nice, must be made of 
nice materials, and must be nicely made. The butter, eggs, 
and fiour should all be fresh. Brown sugar does very well 
for most kinds of cake if rolled free from iumps, and stirred 
to a cream with the butter, or until white ; then adding 
the eggs, flour, and spices. The sugar should be dry, and 
of a light color. The flour should be sifted, and if not per- 
fectly dry, it will make the cake heavy. The whites and 
yolks of the eggs should be beaten to a froth, separately. 
Salaeratus and soda should be completely dissolved, and fil« 



CAKES» GINGERBREAD, AND NUTS. 103 

I «fcd before put into the cake. Raisins should have the 
seeds taken out, or be stoned, Zante currants should be 
rinsed in several waters to cleanse them, rubbed in a dry 
cloth to get the sticks out, and then spread on platters and 
thoroughly dried. Almonds should be blanched and dried, 
then pounded fine with a little rose-water to prevent their 
oiling. In cold weather the ingredients for cake should be 
warmed moderately before mixing them. All kinds of cake 
made without yeast are better for being stirred just before 
they are baked. Salsratus and cream should not be put in 
till just before the cake is baked ; add the fruit last. But- 
ter the cake pans well ; and if the pans are lined with but- 
tered white paper the cake will be less liable to burn. 
Moving cake while baking tends to make it heavy ; avoid 
the moving of it if possible. The quicker most kinds of 
cake are baked, without burning, the better — ^the lighter. 

It is impossible to give definite rules as to the time re- 
quired for baking cake. It should be often looked at while 
baking ; if it browns too fast, a cover of white paper should 
be put over it. To know when rich cake is done, run a 
clean broom splinter through the thickest part of the loaf, 
and if none of the cake adheres to the spUnter, it is baked 
enough. Cake that easily moves on the fiat tins on which 
it is baked, is done enough. 

263. Frosting far Cake. 

Allow for the white of one egg, nine large teaspoonfuls of 
double refined sugar, and one of nice Poland starch, both 
powdered and sifted through a very fine sieve. Beat the 
whites of eggs so stiflT they will adhere to the bottom of the 
plate on turning it upside down; then stir the sugar in 
gradually, stirring constantly about fifteen minutes; add 
a teaspoonful of lemon juice, or essence of lemon, or a 
Httle rose-water. Stir in a few grains of cochineal powder, 
or rose pink, if you wish to color pink ; or of the pow- 
der blue, if you wish to have it of a blueish tinge. Before 
icing a calie, dredge it all over with flour, and then wipe 
oS the flour ; the icing may thus be spread on more even- 
ly. Lay the frosting on the cake with a knife, soon 
after it is drawn from the oven, (it may be either warm or 



104 CAKES) GINGERBREAD, AND NUTS. 

cold ;) smooth it over, and set in a cool place till hard. 
Allow the whites of three eggs for two common sized loaves. 
The appearance of the cake will be much improved by icing 
it twice. Put on the first icing soon after the cake is taken 
out of the oven, and the second the next day, after the £rst 
is perfectly dry. 

Before cutting an iced cake, cut the icing first, by itseJf, 
by pressing the back of the knife nearest the blade end 
across the cake, to prevent the cracking and breaking of the 
icing. Frosting is best, made hy heating from 3 /o 4 spoon- 
fuls sugar toith 1 egg-white, adding teaspoonful lemon juice, 

264. Lemon Cake. 

Take one teacup of butter, and three of powdered loaf 
sugar ; rub them to a cream ; stir into them the yolks of 
five eggs well beaten ; dissolve a teaspoonful of salaeratus 
in a* teacup of milk, and add the milk ; add the juice and 
grated peel of one lemon, and the whites of the five eggs ; 
and sift in^ as light as possible, four teacups of flour. Bake 
in two long tins about half an hour. Much improved by 
icing. 

265. Rich Queen Cake, 

Take a mixed teaspoonful of powdered and sifted mace 
and cinnamon, and one nutmeg; put one pound of powdered 
white sugar into a deep earthern pan, and cut one pound of 
fresh butter washed to it, and stir them till very light. 
Beat ten eggs in a broad shallow platter till perfectly 
smooth and thick ; and take fourteen ounces of sifted floiu: ; 
stir into the butter and sugar a little of the beaten egg, and 
then a little of the flour, and so on alternately, till the whole 
is in ; all the time beating the eggs and stirring the mixture 
very hard. Add, by degrees, the spice ; and then, a little 
at a time, a mixed wineglass of brandy and wine, and half 
a glass of rose-water, or twelve drops of essence of lemon. 
Stir the whole very hard, adding a pound and a half of well 
prepared currants. 

Take about two dozen little tins, and rub them well with 
fresh butter. Put some of the mixture, with a spoon in each 
tin, not filling it, as it will rise high in baking. Bake about 
fifteen minutes, in a quick oven. When done, the cakes 
will shrink a littlo from the side?? of the tins. Make an 



CAKES, GINGERBREAD, AND NUTS. 105 

icing with the whites of three eggs, heaten till j't stand* 
alone, and twenty-four teaspoonfuis of the best of loaf sugar 
powdered, and beaten gradually into the egg. Flavor it 
with a teaspoonful of rose-water, or eight drops of the essence 
of lemon, stirred in at the last. Spread it evenly, with a 
broad knife, over the top of each queen cake, ornamenting 
while the icing is quite wet, with line sugar sand, dropped 
on carefully with the thumb and finger. Set them in a 
warm place to dry ; but not too near the fire, as that will 
cause the icing to crack. 

266. Family Queen Cake, 

Take a pound of sifted flour, one of sugar, and three- 
quarters of butter ; rub the butter and sugar to a cream ; add 
the well-beaten yolks of five eggs, one gill of wine, one of 
brandy, and one of cream, with part of the flour, and a pound 
of stoned raisins, or well prepared currants, and spices to 
the taste ; and then add the whites of the five eggs beaten 
to a stiflf froth, with the remainder of the flour. 

267. Sponge Cake, No. 1. 

Beat twelve eggs as light as possible, (for sponge and 
almond cake they require more beating than for any thing 
else ;) beat a pound of loaf sugar, powdered and sifted, by 
degrees, into the eggs, continuing to beat sometime very 
hard after all the the sugar is in ; (none but loaf sugar will 
make light sponge cake.) Stir in, gradually, a powdered 
teaspoonful of mixed cinnamon and mace, a grated nutmeg, 
and twelve drops of l^mon essence ; lastly, by degrees, put 
in ten ounces of sifted flour, dried near the fire, stirring 
round the mixture very slowly with a knife. If the flour is 
stirred too hard the cake will be tough. It must be done 
gently and lightly, so that the top of the mixture will be 
covered with bubbles. As soon as the flour is all in, begin 
to .bake, as setting will hurt it. 

Put it in small tins, well buttered, or in one large tin pan. 
The thinner the pans, the better for sponge cake. Fill the 
small tins about half full. Grate loaf sugar over the top of 
each before setting them in the oven. When baked, turn 
iver the cakes and frost them

colander; wipe them in a towel; spread them on a large 
dish, placed slanting near the fire or in the hot sun ; when 
dry, sprinkle them well, and the raisins, stoned and halved, 
with sifted flour, to prevent their sinking to the bottom of 
the cake. Take twice as much cinnamon as mace, sift, 
and mix them with the nutmeg ; mix the liquor and rose- 
water in a tumbler ; cut the citron in slips ; sift the flour 
into a broad dish ; and sift the sugar into a broad deep 
earthen pan, cut in the butter, and stir them to a cream, first 
warming them near the fire if the weather is too cold to 
have them easily mix. Beat the eggs as light as possible ; 
stir them alternately with the flour, into the butter and su- 
gar, stirring very hard ; add gradually the spice and liquor ; 
stir alternately the raisins and currants into the mixture ;

ing them singly, till fine and smooUi, in a marble mortar, 
with a little rose-water to keep them from oiling. Beat 
well and separately the whites and the yolks of the eggs. 
Add the sugar gradually to the yolks, beating it in very 
hard ; beat in the almonds by degrees, and then add the 
rose-water. Stir half of the whites into the yolks and su- 
gar. Divide the flour into two equal parts, and stir in one 
half, slowly and lightly, till it bubbles on the top ; then the 
other half of the whites, and the rest of the flour, very 
lightly. Butter a large square tin pan; put in the mixture;

of the four eggs ; Add the essence of lemon ; and beat the 
whole very hard. Lay a wet sheet of paper on the bottom 
of a square tin pan ; drop on it, at equal distances, a small 
teaspoonful of stiff currant jelly, (better to put a little of the 
beaten white of egg and sugar at first under the currant 
jelly ;) with a spoon, pile on some of the beaten white of 
egg and sugar, on each lump of jelly, so as to completely 
cover it, dropping on the mixture as evenly as possible, so 
as to make the kisses of a smooth round shape ; set them 
in a cool oven, and as soon as they are colored they are 
done ; take them out and place them two bottoms together ; 
lay them lightly on a sieve, and dry them in a oool oven 
till the two bottoms stick fast together, so as to form one 
ball or oval.

like lightness, roll out about half an inch thick ; cut into 
cakes with a wineglass, and let them remain fifteen or 
twenty minutes ; and then boil them in a pot, with about 
two pounds of lard. The fat should be hot enough to boil 
up as the cakes are put in, and a brisk fire kept under the 
pot. The pot should be shaken constantly while the cakes 
are boiling ; and only a few should be done at a time, for 
if crowded they will not fry well. If particular in their

124 YEAST. 



343. Convenieni Yeast. 

Receipt of an excellent Virginia housekeeper in Wil^ 
liamsburg. The bread will never sour ; and it may be baked 
tlie same morning the yeast b made. Put into sufficient 
water, two quarts of wheat bran, one pint of Indian bran, 
a handful of hops, and a teacup of parched com, and boil 
all together ; strain it ; when all but cold, stir in a teacup 
of molasses, and add sufficient old yeast to make it ferment ; 
then turn off the white scum and bottle it. Mix some of 
the yeast with a little flour, in a teacup, adding a little su- 
gar ; and set it near the fire about one hour before wanted 
for use. Take off from the dough a piece for use, any 
time during the day. If some of £e dough is reserved for 
light and tender biscuit for tea; work down the dough; add 
a little butter; mould your biscuit; wann and oil your 
baker, and warm the lid and bake. 

344. Milk Yeast. 

It is very nice for biscuit. Take half the milk wanted 
for your biscuit ; place it where warm, adding a little flour 
and salt. When light, mix it with the rest of the milk, and 
use it directly far the biscuit. A pint of this yeast is suffi- 
cient for five or six loaves of bread. It makes sweeter 
bread than any other yeast, but it will not keep. 

345. Potato Yeast. 

Feel and boil soft, a large Irish potato ; rub it through a 
sieve ; add an equal quantity of flour ; make it liquid with 
hop tea ; when a little warmer than new milk, add a gill of 
good yeast. Stir it well, and keep it closely covered in a 
small pitcher. 

346. Patent Yeast. 

Put half a pound of fresh hops to a gallon of water, and 
boil it away to two quarts ; strain it, aod add enourii flour 
to make it a thin batter ; then add half a pint of good yeast 
When well fermented, turn it into a bowl, and work in suf- 
llcient com meai to make it of the consistency of biscuit 
dough. Let it rise. When quite light, make it into little 



BBEAD. 125 

cakes, and dry them in the shade, turning them frequently, 
and keeping them free from damp and dust. 

Where brewer's yeast cjan be had, it will be more con- 
venient to take a quart of that, and a quart of water, about 
milk warm, and work in enough Indian meal to make it the 
consistency of biscuit dough, and then proceed as with the 
two quarts of hop water. 

To prepare the cakes for use, take one or more of the 
cakes, according to your flour ; turn on a little warm water ; 
when it is dissolved, stir it well ; thicken with a little flour, 
and set it near the Are to rise before it is used. The best 
thing to keep yeast in is a small mug or pitcher, with a close 
stopper, under which place a double fold of linen, to make 
it quite close. This is much preferable to a bottle, and is 
easier cleaned. 

347. Wheat Bread. 

Take for half a dozen sized loaves' of breads three pints 
of boiling water ; and mix it with five or six quarts of flour. 
After thoroughly mixed, add three pints of cold water and 
stir the whole to the same temperature. When lukewarm, 
stir in half a pint of family yeast, or a gill of brewer's yeast, 
and a spoonful of salt ; and knead in flour, free of lumps, 
till stiff* enough to mould up. The bread is improved by 
much kneading. Cover it over with a thick cloth, and if 
the weather, is cold, place it near the fire. To know when 
it is risen, cut it through the middle with a knife, and if full 
of small holes like a sponge it is light enough for baking ; 
and it should be baked immediately. If it should get sour 
before you are ready to bake, dissolve two or more tea- 
spoonfuls of salaeratus, according to its acidity, in a teacup 
of milk or water ; strain it on the dough ; work it in well ; 
then cut off* enough for a loaf ; mould it up neatly ; gash it 
on both sides to prevent cracking when baked : and set it in 
a buttered tin pan.. Let pans stand 10 or 12 minutes before , 
baking, and in the oven hour and half, if you wish bread 
baked much. If the wheat is grown, the bread is better 
wet up entirely with boiling water. It should cool before 
adding the yeast. Some think the life of the flour is killed 
by scalding — mistake; the bread will be sweeter; and it 



126 BREAD. 

will keep the longer good. Thus wet up, the bread i% 
nearly as good as if wet with milk. Do not put in the 
yeast while the dough is hot; by its scalding the yeast 
it will kill the life of it. Most ovens need heating about 
an hour and a half. The doors of the room should be kept 
shut, if the weather is cold ; and a bhsk fire kept up. To 
know if your oven is of a right temperature, when cleaned, 
throw in a little flour ; if it brown in the course of a minute, 
it has a right heat ; if it turns immediately black, wait a 
few minutes before setting in. If the oven does not bake 
well, set in a furnace of live coals. A mixture of pine and 
ash, birch, and maple, are all good oven wood. 

348. Excellent Family Bread, 

Take a peck of sifted flour, half a pint of family yeast, or 
a gill of brewer's yeast ; and wet up, with new milk of 
natural warmth, or with skim milk, or water milkwarm, 
adding a little shortening and a teaspoonful of salt. Knead 
it faithfully. Be particular to leave the dough sofl, if wheat ; 
and stiff, if rye. 

349. Sponge Bread. 

Take, for four loaves of bread, three quarts of wheat flour, 
and three of boiling water ; mix them thoroughly, and let 
the mixture remain till lukewarm ; then add twelve spoon- 
fuls of family yeast, or six of brewer's ; place it where 
warm, to rise. When light, knead in flour to make it suffi- 
ciently stiff to mould up. Let it stand for a second rising, 
then mould it. 

350. Rye Bread. 

Wet the flour with lukewarm milk, (water will do, but it 
is not so good,) putting in the same proportions of yeast as 
for wheat bread. Put in two teaspoonfuls of salt for four 
or five loaves of bread ; and two spoonfuls of melted butter 
make it more tender. It should be kneaded more stiff 
than wheat bread. When light, put it into pans without 
moulding it up ; and let it remain in them, before baking, 
about twenty minutes.

stir the mixture into boiling water ; let it boil half an 
hour ; stir in a little salt ; take it from the fire ; let it re- 
main till lukewarm; and then stir in yeast and Indian meal 
till of the consistency of common dough. When light, take 
it out into buttered pans ; let it remain a few minutes, then 
bake it about two hours 3nd a half. 



353. Graham Bread. 

To be sure of having a good article, send good, clean 
wheat to mill ; have it ground rather coarsely, without 
bolting ; and keep the meal in a dry cool place. Sifl it 
through a common hair sieve, before using it This will 
sufficiently separate the grosser particles. 

Take six quarts of this wheat meal, one teacup of good 
yeast, and six spoonfuls of molasses, and mix them with a 
pint of milkwarm water and a teaspoonful of salaeratus. 
Make a hole in the fiour, and stir this mixture in the mid- 
dle of the meal till it is like batter. Then proceed as with 
fine flour. Make it, when light enough, into four loaves. 
Make your oven hotter than for common bread ; and bake 
aboui an hour and a half. It is an excellent article of diet 
for the dispeptic and the costive, and for sedentary persons, 
and for children.

baked enough, take them out, set in the crackers again, and 
let them remain till baked hard and crispy. 

372. Economy Cakes. 

Bread that has been rusked, or that is old and sour, can 
be made into good cakes. Cut the bread into small pieces, 
and soak it till very sofl, in cold water ; drain off the water, 
and mash the bread fine. To three pints of the pulp add 
two well-beaten eggs, three or four spoonfuls of fiour, and 
a little salt. Dissolve a teaspoonful of salaeratus to a tea 
cnp of milk, strain, and stir it into the bread. Add milk 
till the batter is of a consistency little thicker than for buck 
wheat cakes, and fry it in the same manner. 

Another way, which is very good. Mix a tumbler oi 
wheat fiour with two spoonfuls of yeast, and sufficient cold 
water, or milk, to make it a thick batter. When light, 
mix the batter with the bread, reduced to a pulp, adding a

little saltv and a teaspoonfal of salsratus dissolved in a little 
milk. Fry them in just sufficient fat to prevent their stick 
ing to the pan. 

373. Buckwheat Cakes. 

Mix a quart of buckwheat flour with a pint of lukewarm 
milk, or water, and twelve spoonfuls of yeast, and set it in 
a warm place to rise. When lights which will be in eight 
or ten hours, or sooner if brewePs yeast is used, add a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and if sour, a teaspoonful of salsratus dis-

are nice served up with meat for dinner. 

375. Indian Com Cakes. 

Mix a quart of Indian meal with a handful of wheat-flour, 
stir into a quart of warmed milk, a teaspoonful of salt, and 
two spoonfuls of yeast ; stir, alternately into the milk, the 
meal and three well-beaten eggs; when light, bake as buck- 
wheat cakes on a griddle, send them to the table hot. 
Should the batter sour, stir in a little salsratus dissolved in 
luke-warm water, letting it set half an hour before baking. 

376. Indian Slap Jacks. 

Take and scald a quart of Indian meal, in milk, if you 
have it — water will do, turn it out, and stir in half a pint 
of flour, half a pint of yeast, and a little salt. Fry them, 
when light, in just fat sufficient to keep themirom sticking 
to the frying pan. 

Another nice way. Turn a quart of boiling milk or wa- 
ter to a pint of Indian meal, stir in three spoonfuls of floor, 
hree eggs, and two teaspoonful^ of salt. 



HOT CAKES. 133 

377< Journey or Johnny Cakes, 

Sift and scald a quart of Indian meal with water enough 
to make a very thick batter ; add two or three teaspoonful^ 
of salt, and mould it into small cakes with the hands. In 
moulding up, the hands will need a good deal of flouring to 
prevent their sticking. Fry them in nearly sufficient fat to 
cover them. When brown on the under side, turn them. 
Cook them about twenty minutes. When done, split and 
butter them. 

Another way, which is nice. Put to a quart of scalded « 
Indian meal a teaspoonful of salt, the same of salsratus 
dissolved in milk, adding two or three spoonfuls of wheat 
flour. Drop the batter by spoonfuls into the frying pan. 
The batter should be very thick, and there should be just 
fat sufficient to prevent the cakes sticking to the frying pan.

yeast, and a teaspoonful of salt. Fill your waffle irons with 
the batter, when risen, and bake on a hot bed of coals. 
Turn the waffle irons ov^r, when they have been on the 
fire between two and ^ee minutes. They are done 
enough when brown on both sides. The waffle irons 
should be very hot, and well oiled with lard, before each 
cake is put in. The cakes should be buttered as quick as 
cooked. Serve them up with fine white sugar and cinnamon.

stir in, alternately six eggs and half a pint of sifted fiour. 
Beat all well together, and bake on the griddle in cakes 
about the size of a spiall dessert plate. Butter and send 
them to the table, hot. 

Instead of preparing the rice, cold bdUed rice makes very 
nice cakes, mixed and cooked as the prepared. 

385. Wafers. 

To the whites of twelve eggs add a pint of fiour, two 
ounces of melted butter, and enough milk to make a thin 
batter, adding fine loaf sugar to the taste. Pour into the 
wafer irons, bake quickly without browning, and roll thea

skinned,) till all the meat drops off the bone. Drain the 
liquor through a colander or sieve, and skim it well ; let it 
stand till next morning to congeal ; then clean it well frbm 
the sediment, and put it into a tin or bell-metal kettle. Stir 
into it, the mace, sugar, and the cream, having been first 
boiled with a handful of peach leaves, or an ounce of broken 
bitter almonds ; boil hard five minutes, repeatedly stirring

separating from the jelly. Stir till cold — the more tho bet- 
ter. Wash, wipe dry, and then wet your moulds in cold 
water, and put in the blanc mange when it becomes very 
thick. After it has set in the moulds to be quite firm, loosen 
it carefully all round with a knife, and turn it out on glass 
plates. If you wish to make it with almonds, take an 
ounce of blanched bitter almonds and two ounces of sweet, 
pound them with rose-water, add them gradually, when the 
mixture is ready to boil, or while cooling in the bowl, stir- 
ring them well in. If it inclines to stick to the moulds, set

sugar by degrees, till well mixed, aiid strain it through a 
sieve. Put it into a tin that has a close cover, and set the 
tin in a tub ; fill the tub with ice broken in very small 
pieces, and strew among the ice a large, quantity of salt, 
being careful that none of the salt get into the cream. 
Scrape the cream down with a spoon as it freezes round 
the edges of the tin. While the cream is freezing, stir in 
gradually the lemon juice or the juice of a pint of mashed 
strawberries. When it is all frozen, dip the tin in luke- 
warm water ; take out the cream and fill your glasses just 
as ready to use it. It will soon melt. Essence of lemon, 
and the juice of pine apples, are nice to flavor the cream. 

408.' Ice Cream toithout Cream, See No. 308. 

Where cream cannot be procured, a custard made in the 
following manner may be substituted : — To a quart of milk, 
add the beaten yolks of four eggs and a vanilla bean or the 
rind of a lemon ; set it on a few coals, making it very sweet 
with whitB sugar ; stir it constantly till scalding hot, but do 
not let it boil. Remove it froih the fire, and take out the 
lemon peel or bean. When perfectly cold, put it in an ice 
cream form — if you have none, a milk kettle with a tight 
cover may be substituted. Set the form into the centre of 
a tub that is large enough to leave a space of ^ve inches 
from the form to the outside of the tub ; fill the space round 
the form with alternate layers ^of finely cracked ice and 
rock salt, having a layer of ice last, and the whole just as 
high as the form. The tub should be covered with a wool- 
en cloth while the cream is /reeling, and the form should 
be constantly shaken. If you wish to shape the cream, 
pour it into moulds as soon as it freezes, set them in the 
tub, et them remain till just before they are to be eaten, 
ihgn dip them in warm water, and take them immediately 
out, and turn them into dessert dishes. 



CREAMS. 141 



409. Lemon Cream, 

Pare the yellow part only of four fresh lemons ; soak it 
twelve hours in half a pint of cold water, then add the juice 
of the lemons, and half a pint more of cold water. Beat 
to a froth the yolks of three eggs and the whites of eight ; 
strain the lemon juice and water, and mix it with the eggs ; 
sweeten it with double refined sugar, stir it till it grows 
thick, then take it from the fire— stir it till cold. Serve it 
up in glasses. Orange cream is made in the same way. 

410. Vanilla Cream, 

Boil a Vanilla bean in a quart of rich milk until suffi- 
ciently flavored ; take it out, mix with the milk eight well- 
beaten eggs, and boil it a little longer, msCking it very sweet, 
as much of the sugar is lost in freezing. 

411. Strawberry, Raspberry, or Blackberry Cream, 

Make a quart of rich boiled custard, when cold, pour it 
on a quart of ripe fruit ; mash, pass through a sieve, sweeten, 
and freeze it. 

412. Coffee Cream 
Brown two gills of coffee, put it hot, unground, into a 
quart of sweet rich ^milk, boil it, adding the yolks of eight 
eggs ; strain it through a sieve, sweeten, and freeze it. If 
rightly done it will not be discolored. The coffee may be 
dried and used for tea, 

413. Quince, Apple, or Pear., Cream, 

Wash nice fruit, and boil it whole till very tender ; le^ 
it drain and cool ; rub it through a hair sieve ; add an equal 
quantity of cream, and sweeten it. If liked colored, a little 
saflron or cochineal may be added. 

414. Peach Cream, 

Feel and stone nice mellow peaches ; put them in f^ 
bowl ; sprinkle on sugar ; chop them very fine with a silver 
spoon, or reduce them to a smooth pulp ; add as much rich 

13 



142 CAEAMS. 

milk, or cream as you have peach ; add more sugar, and 
freeze it. 

415. Pine Apple^ or Citron^ Cream, 

Cut nice ripe pine apples, or citron melons, selecting the 
best parts, in small pieces, into a china bowl, cover them 
with powdered sugar, and let them stand several hours ; 
drain off the sirup, add to it as much cream as it will fla- 
vor, and freeze it. 

416. Sago, or Barley, Cream, 

Wash the sago, or barley^ clean ; put it on the fire, with 
a stick of cinnamon, and only sufficient water to boil it 
thick and soft ; take out the stick ; add rich boiled custard 
till it is of a proper consistency ; sweeten it, and serve it 
with nutmeg on the top. A litUe white wine may be added 
if liked. 

417. The Froth. 

Sweeten half a pound of the pulp of damsons, or any 
kind of scalded fruit, mix with it the well-beaten whites of 
four eggs, and beat them together till a very stiff froth. 

418. Fruit Tart Cream. 

Boil a stick of cinnamon, two or three peach leaves, or a 
few bruised almonds, in a quart of cream or milk ; strain, 
sweetent ftnd mix it, when cool, with three or four well- 
beaten eggs, and stir it constantly over the fire till it thick- 
ens. It may be eaten with stewed apples, damsons, prunes, 
or any other fruit. 

419. Pink or Red Currant Cream. 

Squeisze three gills of juice from red currants, quite ripe, 
add to it nine ounces of powdered loaf 5ugar, and the iuice 
of one lemon ; stir it into a pint and a half of cream, and 
whisk it till quite thick. Serve it in a glass dish or in 
jelly .glasses. It may be made of currant jeUv mixed with 
lemon juice and sugar. Raspberry and str'iwberry craam 
may be made in the same way. 



TEOETABLSS. 149 



420. To Omoment Creams or Custards, 

Take the wliites of two eggs, and two spoonfuls of rasp- 
berry, or red currant sirup, or jelly, and wliisk them to- 
gether one hour. Lay the froth in any form upon a cream 
or custard, piled up to imitate rock. It may be served in a 
dish by itself, with cream around it. 

421. White Lemon Cream. 

Boil the thin peel of two lemons in a pint of cream, strain 
and thicken it with the well-beaten yolks of three, and 
the whites of four, eggs ; sweeten with powdered loaif su- 
gar, stir till nearly cold, and put it in glasses. 

422. Lemonade Ice, 

Wiih a- quart of rich lemonade, mix the well-beaten 
whites of six fresh eggs, and freeze it. 

The juice of Morello cherries, or of currants^ mixed with 
sugar and water, and prepared in the same way, makes 
very delicate ices. 

423. Vegetables. 

As a general rule, add a little salt to the water in which 
you cook your vegetables, with the exception of dried beans 
and peas. 

424. Potatoes. 

The easiest way to cook Irish potatoes, is to put them in 
just enough boiling water to cover them, with the skins on, 
and to boil them constantly till done. It is the best way ; 
and then to send them hot to the table with the skins on, 
or at that moment taken off. A plain boiled or roasted po- 
tato, when well cooked, is best and most healthful. You 
thus get the grateful flavor of the potato. Potatoes should 
not lie soaking in the water without boiling, if you wish 
them mealy. 

Some cooks say, pare and put them in a pot, with jus* 
boiling water enough to prevent their burning, and a little 
salt ; cover them tight, and boil them till you can easily 
stick a fork through them ; and if any water remains, turn 



144 VEGETABLES. 

it off. and put the pot where it will keep moderately wann 
and let the potatoes steam, with the lid off, a few minutes ; 
then dish them, covering them with a cloth. Old and poor 
potatoes are best boiled till soft, and then peeled and mashed 
fine, with a little butter, salt, and cream or milk added, and 
then put into a dish, smoothed over with a knife, a little 
flour sprinkled over, and set where they will brown. Cold 
prepared, or whole boiled potatoes, are nice sliced, and fried 
with just sufficient butter or lard to prevent their burning. 
When brown on both sides, take them up, and salt and 
butter them. Most potatoes will boil in half an hour ; new 
ones in less time. Some cooks say, put your potatoes into 
cold water to boil them, and neither cover them while boil- 
ing, nor after they are dished. As common a vegetable as 
is the potato, no two cooks are agreed in the best manner 
of cooking it. The best and only satisfactory receipt is : 
suit your own taste. 

425. Potato Snow Balls. 

After boiled tender, drain off the water, and let the pota- 
toes steam till they break to pieces ; take them up, put two 
or three at a time compactly together in a strong cloth, and 
press them tight into a ball, and lay them on a gridiron to 
broil till of a light brown. Or, mix prepared potatoes with 
the yolk of an egg, roll them into balls, flour them or coyer 
them with egg and bread crums ; fry them in good drip- 
pings, or brown them in an oven. 

426. Fried Potatoes, Apples, and Onions, 

Fry brown a few pieces of salt pork, and take them up. 
Put into the fat, or part of it, raw peeled potatoes sliced 
very thin, first lying half an hour in ice-water, and fry them 
* till brown, occasionally stirring them. Fry sUced pleasant 
tart apples, and onions, in the same manner. Thus pre- 
pared, they make a cheap, plain, and good dish. The pota- 
toes may be cut in shavings, like apple-parings^ if preferred. 

427. Roast Potatoes. 

Take potatoes of the same size, wash and dry them, put 
them in a tin Dutch oven or some convenient toaster ; do 
not burn the outside before they are warmed through. 



( 



L 



TBOBTABLBS. 145 

Roast large ones about two hours. They will roasi quicker 
if first parboiled. 

428. To Roast Potatoes under Meat. 

Pare raw potatoes and salt them ; put them in your drip- 
ping pan around your meat, and now and then turn them. 

429. Potato Croquettes, 

Take four large mealy potatoes boiled and peeled, half 
their weight of butter and of pounded loaf sugar, two eggs 
beaten, half the grated peel of a lemon, and a little sdt ; 
pound the potatoes in a mortar with the other ingredients, 
beat the yolk of four eggs, roll up the croquettes, dip them 
in the beaten eggs, and roll them in sifted bread crums ; 
in an hour roll them again, and fry them in butter. 

430. Sweet Potatoes, 

Take such as are of the same size, wash but do not peel 
them ; boil tender, drain off the water, and put them on tin 
sheets in a stove till of a light brown. Or, cut them cross- 
wise without peeling, in slices half an inch thick ; broil 
them on a griddle, and serve them with drawn butter. 

431. Turnips, 

Take such turnips as are white and smooth, and scrape 
them lightly, but thoroughly, rinsing them in cpld water ; 
put them into boiling water with a little salt, and continue 
the boiling about ten minutes, or until you can easily force 
a fork into them. Carry them instantly from the pot to the 
table very hot, with drawn butter.- For mashing, turnips . 
may want a very little more boiling, and perhaps paring. 
Cook them perfectly tender, squeeze them quite dry, mash 
them very smooth, butter, ssdt, and pepper them. 

Yellow turnips require longer cooking than white ones 
If very large, split them in two. 

432. Ragout of Turnips, 

Prepare, as for boiling, turnips sufficient to fill a dish ; 
put them into a stew pan, with a little butter, salt and 
sugar ; set them over a hot stove ; shake and turn them till 

13* 



146 TK6KTABLB8. 

of a good brown ; add half a pint of rich gravy, stew them 
till tender, and &rerve ibem with the added gravy. 

433. Beets, 

To rightly prepare beets for boiling — do not spoil them 
by over-preparing them — ^neither cut nor scrape them. By 
bleeding they become insipid ; only wash ^hem. Boil them 
till tender ; in summer one hour, in winter three. The 
tops, when tender, are good to boil for greens. Boiled* 
beets are nice, sliced into cold spiced vinegar, after remain- 
ing in it a few days. 

434. Parsnips and Carrots. 

If large, after washing split them in two ; lay them in a 
stew pan with the flat side down, and turn on boiling water 
enough to cover them. Boil till tender, or till you can 
easily thrust a fork through them ; take up, skin and butter 
thenL 

435. Omons. 

Peel and put them ihto boiling milk and water — (water 
alone will do, but it is not so good.) When tender, take 
up and salt them, and turn a little melted butter over them. 

436. Boiled Sweet Com. 

Boil corn on the cob, if you wish it sweet. Boil it, cut 
off the cob, with Lima beans, for succotash ; boil it from fif- 
teen to thirty minutes, according to its age. 

437. Fried Sweet Com. 

Cut tender com off the cob. Put it in a pan, and add 
sufficient water to moisten it, a little salt and butter, and fry 
to the liking. 

438. Beans of Voitous Kinds. 

Take the strings off French or striped beans, and if old, 
cut off the edges, and cut through the middle of the beans 
lengthwise. Boil them with a little salt from twenty-five 
to forty-five minutes. A little salaeratus boiled with them 
makes them more healthful, and preserves their green color. 



VEGETABLES. 147' 

Lima boaiis can be kept twelve months. When fresh gath- 
ered, dry them thoroughly in the pod ; or without drying,' 
pack them in a barrel with alternate layers of salt, having 
a layer of salt at the bottom. Cover them quite tight, first 
laying a weight on them to press them compact. Keep 
them in a cool dry place. Snaps can be kept in the samo 
way. When used, wash the pods, lay them all night in 
fresh water, shell them in the morning, and keep them in 
water till ready to boil them. Put them up as late in the 
season as possible. 

439. Boston Baked Beans. 

Take two quarts of middling sized white beans, three 
pounds of salt pork, and one spoonful of molasses. Pick 
the beans over carefully, wash and turn about a gallon of 
soft water to them in a pot ; let them soak in it lukewarm 
over night ; set them in the morning where they will boil 
till the skin is very tender and about to break, adding a tea- 
spoonful of salaeratus. Take them up dry, put them in 
your dish, stir in the molasses, gash the pork, and put it 
down in the dish so as to have the beans cover all but the 
upper surface ; turn in cold water till the top is just cov- 
ered ; bake and let the beans remain in the oven all ni^t. 

Beans are good prepared as for baking, made a little 
thinner, and then boiled several hours with the pork. 

440. Artichokes, 

Scrape and put them in boiling water, with a spoonful of 
salt to two dozen. In about two hours, or when boiled ten- 
der, take them up, salt and butter each one. 

441. Baked Squash. 

Cut " Butter Squash'' in long strips an inch and a half 
thick, and bake it half an hour in buttered tins. 

442. Boiled Squash. 

Boil summer squashes whole, if very tender ; If not, pare, 
quarter, and seed them. When boiled very tender, take 
i them up, put them in a strong cloth, press out all the water, 
1 mash them quite smooth, salt and butter them to your taste 



148 YEGBTABUBS. 

Of a winter aqnash the neck pait is best. Cut it in pieces, 
take off the rind, tie it in a cloth, boil in salt and water till 
tender, press out the water, chop it in a bowl till smooth 
with a trencher, (the same for summer squash,) salt and 
butter it. 

443. Squashes or Cyndings. 

Prepare and boil as for '^ Squash " ; then put them in 
a colander, drain off the water till quite dry, rub them with 
a wooden spoon through the colander, put them in a stew 
pan with a cup of cream, a piece of butter, pepper and salt, 
and stew them tUl very dry. 

444. Greens. 

Turnip tops, white mustard, dock, spinach, water-cresses, 
dandelions, cabbage-plants, the roots and tops of young 
beets, all make nice greens. Boil them, adding a little sal- 
seratns and salt to the water. If not fresh and [dump, soak 
them half an hour in salt and water before cooking. When 
boUed enough they will sink to the bottom of the pot. 

445. Asparagus, 

Cut off and reject the white part of the stalks ; cut the 
lower part of the stalks in thin slices, if tough, and boil 
them eight or ten minutes before putting in the tops. Lay 
the tops compactly together, tie them in small bundles, and 
boil from twelve to twenty-five minutes, putting in the 
water a little salt, and a quarter of a spoonful of salaeratus 
to retain their fresh green color, to two or three quarts of 
water. Just before done, toast a slice of bread, moisten it 
with some of the asparagus liquor, lay it in your dish, but- 
ter it, take up the asparagus carefully with a skimmer, lay 
it on tbe toast, remove the string, salt and turn a little drawn 
butter over the whole. Sea-kale is prepared and cooked 
in the same way. 

446. Salsify — Southern mode. 

Scrape and wash the roots, put them into boiling water 
with a little salt. When sufficiently boiled, drain and place 
them in the dish without cutting them up. They are an 



VEGETABLES. 149 

u «cellent vegetable, but require nicety in cooking. Expo- 
sure to the air, either in scraping or after boiling, makes 
them black. 

447. Salsify or Vegetable Oyster, 

After scraping off the outside, parboil it, slice it, dip the 
slices into a beaten egg and fine bread crums, and fry in 
lard. It is very good boiled, and then stewed a few min- 
utes in milk, with a little salt and butter. Or, make a batter 
of wheat flour, milk, and eggs ; cut the salsify in thin slices, 
first boiling it tender ; put them into the batter with a little 
salt ; drop the mixture into hot fat by spoonfuls. Cook 
them till of a light brown. 

448. Peas. 

Peas are best picked and shelled immediately before 
cooking. Put them in boiling water with a little salt and 
salseratus, in the proportion of a quarter of a teaspoonful to 
half a peck of peas. Boil them from twenty to forty-five 
minutes. When perfectly tender, take them up with a 
skimmer ; salt and butter them to the taste. 

449. Field Peas. 

Gather, prepare, and boil them the same as "Peas"; 
4hen pour them into a colander ; put some butter or lard in 
a frying pan ; when it boils mash the peas, fry them till of 
a light brown in a cake, and put it in a dish with the crust 
uppermost, and garnish with thin bits of fried bacon. They 
are very nice fried whole, so that each pea is distinct from 
the others. But they must be boiled less, and fried with 
great care. Plain boiling is a very common way of cook 
ing them. When dried, cook peas like dried beans. 

450. Cabbage and Cauliflowers. 

Remove the loose leaves, quarter the stump end to the 
heart of the cabbage, wash and have it perfectly clean, and 
boil it from half an hour to an hour. If not boiled with 
salt meat, add a little salt ; a little salaeratus improves its 
color. White cauliflowers are the best. Take off the out* 
side leaves, let them lie in cold water and salt half an hour. 



150 VEGETABLES. 

then boil taem from fifteen to twenty-five minutes in milk 
and water, with a little salt, or in clear water. Keep the 
cabbage covered with water. It will ameliorate the flavor 
of old strong ones, to boil them in two waters. When half 
done, take them out, and put them into a sauce pan of boil- 
ing water. 

451. Brocoli. 

The kind that bears flowers around the joints of the 
stalks, cut into convenient lengths for your dish ; scrape the 
skin from the stalk, and pick out such leaves and flowers 
as need rejection ; tie up in bunches, and boil and season 
it like asparagus. The brocoli that heads at the top like 
cauliflowers, must be treated like cauliflowers. 

452. Celeriac. 

This, though an excellent vegetable, seems to be but 
little known. The stalks of it can hardly be distinguished 
from celery : it is much easier cultivated. The roots are 
nice boiled tender, cut in thin slices, and used in soup or 
in meat pies. Or, scrape and cut them in slices, boil till 
very tender, drain ofl* the water, sprinkle on a little salt, 
turn in milk sufficient to cover them ; stew four or five 
minutes, turn into a dish, and give them a little butter. 

453. Pickled Eggs. See No. 463. 

Boil hard, remove the shells, let stand in weak brine 
2 or 3 days : put in jar, and pour over them boiling vinegar 
seasoned with whole peppers, all^ice and ground ginger. 
When cold, close tight. Fit for use in a month. 

454. Southern Manner of Boiling Rice. 

Pick over the rice, rinse it repeatedly in cold water till 
perfectly clean ; then put it in a pot of boiling water with 
a little salt, allowing a quart of water to a teacup of rice. 
Boil it seventeen minutes, drain off" the water very close, 
set the pot over a few coals, and let it steanf fifteen minutes 
with the lid off. The beauty of rice boiled in this way is, 
each kernel stands out by itself, while it is perfectly tender. 

Be very careful in the boiling and steaming, as a few 
moment i variation in the time, may quite change its looks. 



VEGETABLES. 151 

rhe water should boil hard when the rice is put in, and 
not stop till turned off to have the rice steamed. The water 
the rice is boiled in makes good starch for muslin, if boiled 
a few minutes by itself. 

455. Egg Plant. 

Purple ones are best. Take young fresh ones, pull out 
the stem, parboil them to take out the bitter taste, cut them 
in slices an inch thick without peeling them, dip them in 
the yolk of an egg^ and cover them with grated bread, and 
a little salt and pepper ; when one side has dried, cover t|ie 
other in the same way, then fry them a nice brown. Th^ 
are very delicious, tasting much like soft crabs. The egg- 
plant may be dressed thus : parboil it after scraping off the 
rind ; cut a slit the whole length, and take out the seeds ; 
fill the space with a rich force-meat ; stew it in well-season- 
ed gravy, or bake and serve it up with gravy in the dish. 

456. Potato Pumpkin, 

Take one of a good color, seven or eight inches in diam- 
eter, cut a piece off the top, take out the seeds, wash and 
wipe the cavity, pare it, and fill the hollow with good force- 
meat. Put the top on, set it in a deep pan to protect the 
sides, bake it in a moderate oven, put it carefully in the 
dish without breaking, and it* will look like a handsome 
mould. - 

457. Cucumbers, 

To be salutary, tliey should be eaten within twenty-four 
hours after picked. Keep them in cold water, and fifteen 
or twenty minutes before eating them, pare and slice them 
into fresh cold water to take off the slimy matter. Just be- 
fore carrying to the table, drain off all the water, put them 
in a deep dish, and sprinkle on a good deal of pepper and 
salt, and cover them with vinegar. Cucumbers are thought 
by many people to be very unhealthy ; but if properly pre- 
pared, they will not be found any more so than most other 
summer vegetables. 

To stew cucumbers, pare ten large cucumbers, cut them 
in thick slices, flour them well, and fry in butter ; then put 
them m a sauce pan with a teacup of gravy, and season 



152 VfOKTABLBB. 

with cayenne, salt, and caUup. Stew them an honr and 
•erre them hot 

458. Salads. 

To have this delicate dish m perfection, pick your lettuce, 
pepper-grass, chervil, cress, &c. early in the morning ; 
wash and lay it in cold water, if iced the better: just be- 
fore dinner, drain the water from your salad, cut it into a 
bowl, giving the proper proportions of each plant, and pre- 
pare the following mixture. Boil two fresh eggs ten min- 
utes, put them in water to cool, then put the yolks in a 
soup-plate, turn on them a spoonful of cold water, rub them 
with a wooden spoon till they are quite dissolved, and add 
two spoonfuls of oil. Mix it well, adding one teaspoonful 
of salt, one of powdered sugar, and one of made mustard. 
These all being mixed quite smooth, stir in two spoonfuls 
of tarragon vinegar, and two of common. Put it over the 
salad, and garnish the top with the whites of the eggs cut 
in rings, and lay around the edge of the bowf young scall- 
ions, ihey being the most delicate of the onion family. Some 
cooks say, if you have not salad oil, melt a little butter and 
put it in a separate dish ; if turned over the salad it will not 
be crispy. 

459. Stewed Mushrooms. 

Gather such as are grown, but are young enough to have 
red gills ; cut off that part of the stem which grew in the 
earth, wash them carefully, and take the skin from the top ; 
put them in a stew pan with some salt, stew them till ten- 
der, thickening them with a spoonful of butter, mixed with 
one of brown flour. A little red wine may be added ; but 
the flavor of the mushroom is too delicious to require aid 
from any thing. 

460. Broiled Mushrooms. 

Prepare them as before directed : broil them on a griddle, 
and when done, sprinkle salt and pepper on the gills, and 
put a little butter on them. 

461. Tomatoes, 

If very ripe, tomatoes will readily skin ; if not, pour scald- 
ing water on them, and let them remain in it four or five 



PICKLES. 153 

minutes. Peel and put them in a stew pan with a spoon- 
ful of water, if not very juicy ; if 80» no water will bo 
required. Put in a little salt, stew them half an hour, and 
then turn them into a deep di^ with buttered toast, or omit 
the toast, and add butter and pepper. Another way of 
cooking them, which is considered very nice by epicures, 
is to put them in a deep dish, witk fine bread criims, or crack- 
ers pounded fine, a layer of each alternately ; put a little 
pepper and salt, and small bits of butter on each layer. 
Some cooks add a little nutmeg and sugar. Place a layer 
of bread crums on the top. Bake it forty-five minutes. 

462. Mustard. 

Young mustard is a very good vegetable, prepared and 
cooked like other " Greens." Ground mustard is best, 
fresh made. Mix it by degrees with fine salt ; rub them 
together till perfectly smooth, wetting up with a little milk, 
if it be eaten immediately ; or with hot water. 

463. Directions for Pickling. See No. 453. 

Take sharp cider vinegar for pickling, but not the very 
sharpest. Use brass utensils, first thoroughly cleaning 
them, and suffer no vinegar to cool in them, as the rust 
formed by so doing is very poisonous. A good way is, to 
boil alum and salt in the vinegar, in the proportion- of half 
a teacup of salt and a spoonful of alum, to three gallons of 
vinegar. But for the best way of pickling cucumbers, see 
" Cucumbers." Keep pickles in a cool dry place, and either 
in glass, stone, or wooden vessels. If particular, use wide 
mouthed glass bottles, or stone jars, having corks which 
must be fitted in with linen, and covered with bladder or 
leather ; and for taking the pickles out and for returning 
them, using a small wooden spoon. It is essential to the 
beauty and excellence of the pickles, that they be always 
completely covered with vinegar. All kinds of pickles 
should be stirred up occasionally ; the soft ones, if any, 
should be taken out, the vinegar scalded, and turned back 
scalding hot. Jf very weak, throw it away, and take new ■ 
vinegar. Whenever any scum rises, scald the vinegar. If 
you do not wish to have all your pickles spiced, keep a 

14*^ 



154 riCRLEK. 

stone pot of spiced vinegar by itself, and put in a few from 
time to time, as you want spiced pickles. 

464. Cucumbers. 

Gather those that are small and green, and of a quick 
growth. Pour on them boiling hot strong brine, and let 
them remain in it twenty-four hours ; take them out, lei 
them dcy, and put them into sharp vinegar. Repeat the 
same process daily, or as often as you wish to make addi- 
tions. The same brine may be used several times, pouring 
it on each mess of cucumbers boiling hot, and letting 
them remain twenty-four hours before taking out, drying, 
and putting into the vinegar. When you have done pick- 
ling, scald the vinegar three days in succession, pouring it 
on the cucumbers boiling hot. If necessary add new 
vinegar. 

465. To pickle Cucumbers. 

Prepare the cucumbers by scalding them in brine ; put 
them into a mixture of one part whiskey and three parts 
water ; secure them closely. By Christmas they will be 
hard, of a fine flavor, and will retain their original color. 
The liquor will be excellent vinegar for the table. 

466. Tomatoes. 

Prick the skins of fair ripe tomatoes ; spread them in 
layers, and on each layer put pounded mace, cloves, and 
cinnamon, and pour cold vinegar over the whole. The 
vinegar from tomatoes thus prepared, is preferable to 
catsup, 

467. Mangoes. 

Take green muskmelons as late in the season as possi- 
ble, cut a small piece from the side that lay next the ground, 
and take out the seeds. If the citron or nutmeg melons are 
used for mangoes, scrape off the rough part. The long 
common muskmelons are best. Soak the melons in salt 
and water three or four days ; take them out, sprinkle the 
inside with powdered cloves, pepper and nutmeg ; fill them 
with fine strips of horseradish, cinnamon, and small string 
beans. Nasturtions and radish tops are also nice. Fill the 



picxxES. 155 

crevices nvith 'American mustard seed. Put back the piece 
of melon that was cut off, and bind the melon up tight with 
white cotton cloth, sewing it on. Place the melons the 
covered side up, in a stone jar. Boil alum and salt in vin- 
egar in the proportion of six spoonfuls of salt and one of 
alum, to three gallons of vinegar, adding peppercorns to the 
liking, and pour the vinegar, scalding hot, on the melons. 
Barberries, or radish tops, pickled in bunches, are a nice 
garnish for mangoes. The barberries preserve their natural 
color best by being first dried. Whenever wanted for use, 
turn boiling vinegar over them, and let them lay several 
hours to swell. Pickle mangoes like '* Cucumbers." 

468. Butternuts, 

Pick your butternuts about the fourth of July, or not so 
late but what a pin can readily be put through them ; lay 
them in salt and water ten days, changing the water every 
day ; then rub off their coat with a coarse rough cloth. 
For one hundred nuts make a pickle of two quarts of vin- 
egar, one ounce of pulverized pepper, one of ginger, half an 
ounce of mace, half of cloves, half of nutmegs, and a spoon- 
full of mustard seed. Put the spices in a thin muslin bag, 
lay it in the vinegar with* the nuts, and boil all a few min- 
utes, then set them away. 

469. Walnuts. 

Gather your nuts in July, put them in a strong brine nine 
days, changing them every other day ; take them out, wipe 
them dry with a woolen cloth, put them in cold vinegar and 
salt six weeks, then make your pickle of mace, cloves, nut- 
megs, whole pepper, race ginger, garlic, shallots, bruised 
mustard seed, and horseradish — ^let it be very strong. Boil 
it, and when cold, turning off the old vinegar from the nuts, 
pour on the new — stop tight. 

470. Cabbage. 

Take purple cabbages for pickling. Strip off the loose 
leaves, quarter them, put them in a keg, sprinkle a great 
deal of salt on each, and let them remain all but a week. 

To a gallon of vinegar, add an ounce of mace, and one 
of peppercorns and cinnamon. Cloves and allspice improve 



ifiO PICKLES. 

the taste, but darken the color of the cabbages. Add a 
little alum to the vinegar, and pour it boiling hot on the 
cabbages, letting the salt remain. Repeat the boiling of 
the vinegar, and turning it on the cabbages six or seven 
times every two or three days, to make them tender. 

471. Cabbages and Cauliflowers. 

Slice red cabbage into a colander, and spT inkle each 
layer with salt ; let it drain two days, then put it into a jar, 
and cover it with boiling vinegar, adding a few slices of red 
beet. Spices may be boiled in the vinegar to the taste. 
Cauliflowers, cut into bunches and thrown in after being 
salted, will have a beautiful red. 

472. Peppers. 

Take such as are fresh and green ; cut a small slit in 
them ; take the seeds out carefully and neatly with a small 
knife ; and wash them. Pour weak boiling brine over 
them, and let them stand four days, renewing the brine daily 
boiling hot. Chop cabbage fine; season it highly with 
cinnamon, mace and cloves ; and stuff the peppers, adding 
nasturtions if liked. Sew them up nicely ; and turn the 
same sharp vinegar boiling hot over them, three successive 
weeks, adding a little alum the last 

Tomatoes, if green and small, are good pickled with the 
peppers. 

473. East India Pickle, 

• 

Chop cabbage fine, leaving out the stalks, with three 
onions, a horseradish root, and two green peppers to each 
cabbage. Soak all in salt and water three or four days. 
Season vinegar very highly with mace, cloves, cinnamon, 
and allspice. Add alum and salt to the vinegar, and pour 
it on boiling hot, the brine being previously turned' off. It 
will be fit to eat in about three weeks. 

474. French Beans and Radish Pods. 

Take such as are quite small and tender ; throw them 
into salt and water as they are gathered, changing the water 
every four days. Scald them in salt and watec ; let them 
remain till cool ; turn pff the brine, and pour on scalding 



yicKLEs. 157 

vinegar spiced with mace, allspice, and peppercorns. The 
radish top, if pickled in small bunches, is a pretty garnish 
for other pickles. 

475. Peaches and Apricots. 

Take peaches, fully grown, just before becoming mellow. 
Let them lie covered in a brine made of soft water, strong 
enough to bear up an egg, one week ; take them out, wipe 
them carefully with a soft cloth, place them in a pickle jar. 
Put to a gallon of vinegar half an ounce of cloves, and half 
an ounce of peppercorns, sliced ginger root, mustard seed, 
and a little salt, and pour it on the peaches, boiling hot. 
Turn off the vinegar, and turn it on again, boiling hot, seve- 
ral times. 

476. Nasturtions. 

Put them when green and small in salt and water, and 
change the water every three days. When done collecting 
the nasturtions, pour off the brine, and turn on boiling vin- 
egar, adding a little alum. 

477. Onions. 

Peel and boil small onions in milk and water ten minutes. 
Put to a gallon of vinegar half an ounce of cinnamon, half 
an ounce of mace, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, five 
spoonfuls of salt, and half an ounce of alum, and turn the 
whole boiling hot on the onions, the milk and water being 
first drained from them. 

478. Gherkins. 

Put them in strong brine, and keep them where warm. 
When they turn yellow, pour off the brine, and turn on hot 
vinegar. Keep them in it till they turn green ; then pour 
away the vinegar, and add fresh scalding vinegar, seasoned 
with peppercorns, mace, allspice, alum, and salt. 

479. Mushrooms. No. 1. 

Stew them after peeled, with just water enough to pre- 
vent their sticking to the bottom of the pan. Shake them 
now and then, to prevent their burning. When tender, take 

14* 



158 PfCKLKS. 

them up, and put them in scalding vinegar, spiced with 
mace, peppercorns, and cloves, adding a little salt. Bottle 
and cork tight, for long keeping. 

480. Mushrooms. No. 2. 

Take huttons, such only are fit for this use, and rub them 
with a soft flannel and salt ; sprinkle on a little salt ; put 
them into a stew pan with a little mace and pepper. As 
the liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them orer 
a gentle fire, till all of it is dried in again. Then put as 
much vinegar into the pan as will cover them ; give it one 
warming, and turn the whole into a glass or stone jar. They 
will keep two years, and they are delicious. 

481. Beets, 

Boil them sufficiently tender to easily put a fork through 
them ; put them into cold vinegar, with a little salt, set them 
in a cool place, and . stir them often to prevent any scum 
from rising. Beets should never be cut or scraped, till 
afler boiling. 

482. Oysters and Clams. 

Take the oysters from the liquor ; rinsing ofif the pieces 
of shell, if any ; strain, boil, and skim it ; then put the 
oysters into the boiling liquor, with whole peppercorns, 
spice, and mace, with a little salt, and boil all one minute. 
Take the oysters immediately out of the liquor, and let 
them cool ; add as much vinegar as oyster liquor, and boil 
fifteen minutes, and then turn it hot on the oysters. Keep 
them cool and air tight, and they will retain their natursd 
color. 

Pickle clams in the same way, only boil them longer. 

483. Smelts. 

Take and clean two quarts of smelts ; pound, very fine, 
half an ounce of pepper, half of nutmeg, half of saltpetre, 
a quarter of an ounce of mace, and four ounces of common 
salt. Lay the smelts in rows in a jar, and between the 
layers strew the seasoning, with four or fiv^ bay leaves. 
Boil red wine, and pour over enough to cover them. When 
cold, tie a cover over them. 



SIRUPS. ' 159 



484. Mackerel 

Divide each into four or six round pieces. To six large 
mackerel, put one ounce of beaten pepper, three nutmegs, 
a little mace, and a handful of salt. Mix your salt and 
beaten spices together, make two or three holes in each 
piece of mackerel, and ptit your seasoning into them, rub- 
bing them over with it, and fry them brown in oil. When 
cold, put them in vinegar, and cover them with oil. If well 
covered, they will keep a great while, and they are 
excellent. 

485. Lemon Sirup. 

Pare off the yellow part of the rind of fresh lemons ; 
squeeze out the juice, strain it, and to a pint of it put a 
pound and three-quarters of sugar. Dissolve the sugar by 
a gentle heat, skim it till clear, then, adding the rinds, sim- 
mer gently eight or ten minutes, and strain it through a 
flannel bag. When cool, bottle it, and seal the corks. 

486. Orange Sirup, 

Squeeze out and strain the juice of fresh oranges. To 
a pint of the juice add a pound and a half of sugar ; place 
it on a moderate fire ; put in the peel of the oranges ^fler 
the sugar has dissolved, and set the sirup where it will boil 
slowly six or eight minutes ; then strain it through a flan- 
nel bag. Do not squeeze the bag while the sirup is pass- 
ing through, if you wish it clear. It is nice to flavor pies 
and puddings. 

487. Blackberry Sirup. 

Procure the high blackberries that are ripe and nice ; 
simmer them over a moderate fire, till they break to pieces, 
and then strain them through a flannel cloth. To each 
pint of the liquor add a pound of white sugar, half an ounce 
of powdered cinnamon, a quarter of an ounce of powdered 
mace, and two teaspoonfuls of powdered cloves. Boil all 
fifleen minutes ; strain it, and when cool add to each 
pint of sirup, a wineglass of French brandy. Bottle, 
cork, and seal it, and keep it where cool. This, mixed in 
the n'-ODOrtion of a wineglass of sirup to two-thirds -of a 



160 SWESTMKATS AND JELLIES. 

tumbler of cold water, is an excellent remedy for the dys^ 
enteiy, and similar complaints. It is also a very grateful 
summer bererage. 

488. Elderberry Sirup, 

Take berries perfectly ripe ; wash and strain them ; put 
a pint of molasses to a pint of the juice ; boil it twenty 
minutes, stirring it constantly ; when cold, add to each 
quart, a pint of French brandy. Bottle, and cork it tight. 
It is an excellent remedy for a tight cough. 

489. Molasses Sirup for Preserving. 

Mix eight pounds of light sugar-house or New Orleans 
molasses with eight pounds of water, and one of powdered 
charcoal ; boil all twenty minutes and strain it through a 
flannel bag. When lukewarm, put in the beaten whites of 
two eggs and set it on the fire ; as soon as it boils, take it 
from Sie fire and skim it till clear ; set it on the fire again 
and let it boil till it becomes a thick sirup, then strain it for 
use. This sirup does very well to preserve fruit in for 
common use. 

490. SweetmecUSy Drinks, ^c. 

The sugar used for the nicest sweetmeats should be the 
best double refined ; but if the pure, amber colored, sugar- 
house sirup, from the West Indies, can be gotten, it is far pre- 
ferable. It never ferments. The trouble is very much lessen- 
ed by having ready made sirup, in which it is only necessary 
to boil the fruit till clear. All delicate fruit should be done 
gently, and not allowed to remain over half an hour after 
it begins to simmer, before it is laid on dishes to cool. It 
must be put in the sirup again another half hour. Con- 
tinue so to do till it is sufiiciently transparent. The pre- 
serves are less liable to boil to pieces than if done by ono 
continued boiling. 

In preparing sugar for sweetmeats, let it be quite dis- 
solved before you put it on the fire. If dissolved in water, 
allow a tumbler of water to a pound of sugar. If you boil 
the sugar before adding the fruit, it will be improved in 
cleames by passing it through a flannel bag. Skim off the 
brown scum, all the time it is boiling. If sweetmeats are 



SWEETMEATS AND JELLIES. 161 

boiled too long, theylos'e their flavor and become dark. 
If not boiled long enough, they will not keep. You may 
know when jelly is done, by dropping a teaspoonful cold 
into a glass of water. If it spreaids and mixes with the 
water, it needs more boiling ; if it sinks to the bottom in a 
lump, it is done enough. Raspberry jelly needs most boil- 
ing of any kind. Black currant the least. 

Keep your sweetmeats cool and dry, in glass, China, or 
stone jars. Delicate preserves should be kept in small 
glasses or pots that will not hold more than one or two 
pounds ; the admission of air injures them. Glass is best. 

Cover the top, after sprinkling it over with sugar, with 
white paper dipped in hot clarified sugar. It is far better 
than rum or brandy. Over the whole confine a cover so 
close as to enturely exclude the air 

491. To Clarify Sugar for Sweetmeats. 

Put your sugar into the preserving kettle, pour in as 
much cold water as you think may be wanted to cover the 
firuit to be preserved ; a gill to a pound of sugar ; beat the 
fvhites of eggs to a froth, allowing one egg to three pounds 
of sugar ; mix the whites with the sugared water ; set it on 
A slow fire, stirring the whole well together ; then set it 
where it will boil. As soon as it boils up well, take it from 
the fire, let it remain for a minute, then take off the scum ; 
set it back on the fire, and let it boil a minute, then take 
it off and skim it again. Repeat this operation till the sirup 
is clear ; and put Uie fruit in when it is cold. The fruit 
should not be crowded while doing ; and if there is not suffi- 
cient sirup to cover the fruit, take it out of the sirup, and put 
in more water, and boil it with the sirup before putting back 
the fruit. 

492. Directions for Making Sweetmeats, 

For preserving most kinds of fruit, a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit is sufficient. Some kinds of fruit require 
more, and some wOl do with less, than their weight of su- 
gar. Good brown sugar, if clarified before putting in the 
fruit, does very well, for most kinds of fruit; and for family 
use, three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of frui 
does very well. The nicest' white sugar needs not be clari 



1G2 SWEETMEATS AND JELLIES. 

fied. All kinds of fire-proof ware, except iron ware, will 
do to preserve in. Enameled kettles of iron lined with 
china, called preserve' kettles, are best. The firait should 
be turned out of the preserving kettle as soon as done, and 
set away. It should be looked to often, to see that it does 
not ferment. Whenever it does, the sirup should be turned 
off and scalded, and turned back while hot. 

493. Q^ince Marmalade. 

The fruit should not be over ripe — ^not mellow. Gather 
it on a dry day, and after a dry day. Some make this pre- 
serve, by covering the fruit and sugar close in a wide 
mouthed jar, and then setting the jar in a kettle of cold 
water, and thus boiling the fruit till tender. This preserves 
its flavor. 

Wash and quarter the quinces, without paring ; set them 
on the fire with just sufficient water to stew them ; rub 
them through a sieve, when soft, and put to each pound of 
the pulp a pound of brown sugar ; set it on a few coals, 
stew slowly and stir it constantly. When it has simmered 
an hour, take out a little and cool it, if it then cuts smooth, 
it is sufficiently done. 

494. Preserved Quinces, 

Pare and core your quinces, taking out the parts that are 
knotty and defective ; cut them in quarters, or round slices ; 
put them in your preserving kettle ; cover them with the 
parings and a very little water ; lay a large plate over them 
to keep in the steam, and boil them till they are tender. 
Take out the quinces, and strain the liquor through a bag. 
To every pint of liquor, allow, a pound of loaf sugar, boil 
the juice and sugar together about ten minutes, skimming it 
well ; put in the quinces and boil them gently twenty min- 
utes. WheA the sugar has completely penetrated them, 
take them out, put them in a glass jar, and turn the juice 
over them warm. Tie them up, when cold, with paf^r 
dipped in clarified sugar. 

495. Preserved Pine Apples, 
Having pared your pine apples, slice them, and take om 



SWEETMEATS AND JELLIES. 163 

the core from the middle of each slice. To each pound of 
pine apple allow a pound of loaf sugar. Mix half the su- 
gar with the pine apple, and let them lie all night, to extract 
the juice ; then mix them with the remaining half of the su- 
gar, and put the whole in a preserving, kettle. Boil it till 
clear and tender, but not till the slices break. Skim it well ; 
set away to cool ;— or, without boiling, chop fine, and add 
equal weight of sugar ; put in glass jars, and seal tight. 

496. Preserved Currants, 

Take ripe currants, in their prime ; strip them off their 
stems, rejecting the bad ones ; make a sirup of sugar and 
very little water, allowing a pound of sugar tp each pound 
of currants, and let them boil a few minutes. In a few 
days turn the sirup from them, scald it, and turn it back, 
while hot, on the currants. Preserved currants, mixed 
with water, are an excellent drink in fevers. Dried cur- 
rants are also good, made into a tea, for the same use. 

497. Preserved Strawberries. 

To each pound of picked strawberries, allow a pound 
of powdered loaf sugar. Strew half of the sugar over the 
strawberries, and let them stand in a cool place two or three 
hours ; put them in a preserving kettle, over a slow fire, and 
by degrees, strew on the rest of the sugar ; boil them fifteen 
or tw^enty minutes, and skim them well. Put them in wide 
mouthed bottles, and when cold, seal the corks. If you 
wish to do them whole, take them carefully out of the sirup, 
(one by one,) while boiling, spread them to cool on large 
dishes, not letting the strawberries touch each other ; when 
cool, return them to the sirup, and boil them a little longer. 
Repeat this several times. Keep the bottles in dry sand. 

Gooseberries, currants, cherries, grapes, and raspberries 
may be done in the same way. 

498. Preserved Pippins, - 

Pare and dbre some of the finest ; put them in your pre- 
serving kettle, with some lemon peel and all the parings 
add a very little water, cover closely, boil till tender, taking 
care that they do not burn ; take out the apples, spreading 
them on a large dish to cool; pour the liquor into a bag 



164 SWEETMEATS AND JELLIES. 

and strain it ; put it in your kettle with a pound of loaf su- 
gar to a pint of juice, adding lemon juice to the taste ; boil 
them slowly half an hour, or till they are quite, soft and 
clear ; put them with the liquor into your jar, and when 
quite cold, tie them up with clariued, or with brandy paper. 
They are not intended for long keeping. 

Hard pears may be done in the same way, either whole 
or halved, flavoring them to the taste. 

499. Preserved Crab Apples. 

Wash the apples ; cover the bottom of your preserving 
kettle with grape leaves ; put them in ; place them over the 
fire, with a very little water, covering them closely ; sim- 
mer them gently till yellow ; take them out and spread 
them on a large dish to cool; pare and core them; put 
them again into your kettle, with fresh vine leaves under 
and over them, and a very little water, and hang them over 
the fire till they are green, but do not let them boil. When 
green, take them out ; allow a pound of loaf sugar to a 
pound of apple ; dissolve the sugar in just sufficient water ; 
put it over ihe fire, when dissolved ; boil and skim it ; put 
in your apples, and 'boil them till quite clear and tender. 
Put them in jars, turn the juice over them, and when cold, 
tie them up. 

500. Preserved Apples, 

Take equal weights of good brown sugar and of ^ples ; 
peel or wash, core, and chop the apples fine ; allow to every 
three pounds of sugar a pint of water ; dissolve, then boil 
the sugar pretty thick, skimming it well ; add the apples, 
the grated peel of one or two lemons, and two or three 
pieces of white ginger ; and boil till the apples look clear 
und yellow. This will keep years. Crab apples done in. 
this way, without paring, are next to cranberries. 

501. Transparent Apples. 

Dissolve and boil a pound of loaf sugar in a quart of wa- 
ter ; skim it ; put in select apples, pared, quartered, and 
cored, with the juice of a lemon, and let them boil, uncov- 
ered, till tender. 



SWEETMEATS AND JELLIBS. 165 



502. Good Family Apph'Sauce, 

Take two quarts of water, a pint of molasses, and a root 
of race ginger, and boil all hard twenty minutes. Put in, 
while boiling, a peck of pared, quartered, and cored apples, 
and boil the whole moderately an hour and a half or two 
hours. 

503. Cider Apple Sauce. See Nos. 515 and 651. 

Boil down new sweet cider, till about as thick as molas- 
ses when cold, strain it through a sieve, then, as soon as 
it boils, put in your apples, pared, quartered, and cored, and 
stew over a slow coal fire, till the fruit is perfectly tender. 

504. Black Butter. 

Allow to any kind of berries, stoned cherries, curranti^, 
^c, half their weight of sugar, and boil till reduced one- 
quarter. This is a healthful and nice substitute for butter 
for children. 

'505. Preserved Peaches, 

Select the largest and nicest free-stone peaches, fully 
grown but not mellow, pare, halve,* or quarter them ; crack 
the stones, take out and break the kernels ; put parings and 
all into your preserving kettle, with a very little water ; 
boil till tender ; then take out and spread the peaches on a 
large dish to cool. Strain the liquor through a sieve or bag ; 
next day, put to each pint of the liquor a pound of loaf sugar. 
Put the liquor and sugar, dissolved, into the kettle with the 
peaches, and boil them slowly till they are quite soft, skim-, 
ming all the time ; take the peaches out, put them into your 
jars, and turn the liquor over them warm. When cold, tie 
them up with clarified paper. If boiled too long, they will 
be of a dark color #• To preserve peaches whole, thrust out 
the stones with a skewer, and put in their place, after done, 
the kernels blanched. Broad, shallow, stone pots keep 
large fruit the best. 

8 lbs. fruit, and 8 sugar. Scald peaches, few at a time, ix\ 
a little water with 2 lbs. sugar. Let lie in this thin sirup 
2 days. Drain and put them in remaining 6 Iba. of melted 
sugar, and scald 8 or 10 minutes. Other fruits same way. 

15 



166 SfWEETMEATS AND JELLIES. 

506. Peaches^ Apricots, and Plums, preserved in Brandy. 

Take nice yellow peaches, not too mellow ; put them in 
a poty wad cover them with weak cold lye ; take them out in 
one hoar, and wipe them carefully wiUi a soft cloth to get 
off the down and skin, and lay them in cold water ; tsJLe 
their" weight in loaf sugar, adding enough water to corer the 
fruit ; boU and skim it ; put in &e peaches, and stew them. 
Irom eight to fifteen minutes ; take them out and lay them 
on dishes to cool ; boil the sirup till reduced one half; then 
tie up the peaches cold, covering them with equal quanti- 
ties of sirup and French brandy. Do apricots in the same 
way, only let them stew but five or six minutes. Plums 
and cherries are excellent preserved in the same manner. 

507. Preserved Cranberries, 

Allow to each pound of washed cranberries, a pound of 
loaf sugar, dissolved in about a gill of water, first boiling 
the sugar and skimming it well about ten minutes, then add- 
ing the cranberries. Boil slowly, till they are quite soft 
and of a fine color. Put them up warm. When cold, tie 
them up. Common glstss tumblers are very convenient for 
preserved small fruits and jellies. 

508. Preserved Gages, 

Take equal weights of gages and sugar; dissolve the su- 
gar in just sufiicient water to cover the plums ; boil them 
slowly in the sirup ten minutes ; turn them into a dish, and 
let them remain four or five days ; boil them again, till the 
sirup appears to have entered the plums ; put Siem up ; in 
a week, turn the sirup from them, scald it, turn it over them 
hot ; and, when cold, tie them up. 

609. Preserved Damsons, 

Allow for every pound of damsons three-quarters of a 
pound of powdered sugar ; put alternate layers of fruit and 
sugar into jars, or well-glazed earthen pots ; tie over strong 
paper, or cloth, and set them in the oven after the bread is 
drawn, and let them stand till the oven is cold. The next 



SWEETMEATS AND JELLIES 167 

day, strain oif the sirup, boil it till thick, turn it warm over 
the fruit in jars, and, when cold, tie up. 

510. Preserved Pumpkin. 

Cut slices from a nice, high-colored pumpkin, and cut 
the slices into chips about the thickness of a dollar ; have 
the chips of an equal size, six inches in length, and an inch 
broad. Put to each pound of fruit a pound of loaf sugar. 
Pare off and lay aside the yellow rind of some lemons ; 
squeeze out the juice, allowing a gill to a pound of pump- 
kin. Put the pumpkin into a broad pan, layiner the sugar 
among it ; turn the lemon juice over it ; cover me pan, and 
let the whole set all night. In the morning, put the whole 
in a preserving pan, and boil, skimming it well, till the 
pumpkin becomes clear and crisp, but not till it breaks. It 
should have the appearance of lemon candy ; and, if liked, 
some lemon peel, cut in very fine pieces, may be added. 
About half an hour's boiling is sufficient. When done, take 
out the pumpkin, spread it on a large dish, and strain the 
sirup through a bag ; put it into jars, turn the sirup over it, 
and tie up. It is very nice ; may be eaten without cream, 
or laid on puff paste shells after they are baked. 

511. Preserved Grapes, 

Allow a pound of sugar to a pound of grapt^s ; squeeze 
out the pulp, and boil it till quite soft ; strain it through 
cloth ; to this add your sugar and clarify it ; then throw in 
your skins, and boil till thick enough to please. 

512. Preserved Pears. 

Allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of 
p'Mirs. Clarify the sugar, if brown is used, then put in the 
fruit, and boil it till tender. A few pieces of ginger, or fine 
ginger tied up in bags, may be boiled with the pears, to fla- 
vor them. Vergouleuse and choke pears are the best for 
preserving. 

613. WirUer Bell Pears. 

Take some of the nicest, put them in an iron poi, filling 
it about half full, cover them with water, and boil them. 
After giving them a thorough boiling, and making them ten- 



IGO SWEETMEATS AND JELLIES. 

der, let them Bteani over a slow fire, covering the pot close, 
to conline the steam, five or six hours, till but just sufficient 
juice 10 prevent their burning. If done right, they will be 
as red as cranberry preserves, retaining all the rich natural 
flavor of the pear, and will require care in taking up to pre- 
vent their breaking. I'hey are nice, thus plainly cooked ^ 
but if preferred, a little molasses may be added toward the 
]ast. 

514. Preserved Cherries, 

Take cherries before dead ripe ; allow a pound of white 
sugar to a pound of fruit ; dissolve and boil the sugar, hav- 
ing it thick, put in the cherries with the stems on, and let 
them boil till transparent. Tie them up in glass jars. 
The carnation and common light red, if done carefully, will 
be so transparent the stones may be seen through them. 

To preserve them without the stones, take such as are 
very ripe, push out the stone carefully with a darning nee- 
' die, make sirup of the juice, and then boil the cherries to a 
thick consistency. 

515. Quince and Apple Sauce. See Nos. 503, 651. 

3 lbs. quince ; 6 lbs. apple ; 6 su^ar ; and- 2 or 3 lem- 
ons. Cluarter quinces and apples. When both boiled soft, 
add sugar. Boil an hour. Boil lemons, sliced, in a little 
water, till soft, and stir them in just before taking from fire. 

516. Preserved Tomatoes, 

Take toftiatoes quite small and green, and if fully ripe 
they are nice ; put them in cold clarified sirup, with one 
orange, cut in slices, to every two pounds of tomatoes ; sim- 
mer them gently two or three hours, allowing equal weights 
of sugar and tomatoes, and more than barely enough watet 
to cover the tomatoes, for the sirup. 

Another very nice method of preserving them is, allow 
two fresh lemons to three pounds of the tomatoes ; pare of! 
only the yellow part of the rind ; squeeze out the juice, and 
mix the rind and juice with enough cold water to cover the 
tomatoes, and add a few peach leaves and powdered ginger 
tied up in bags. Boil all gently together, forty-five minutes, 
take out the tomatoes, strain the liquor, and put to it a pound 
and a half of white sugar, for each poimd of tomatoes ; put 



SWEETMEATS AND TELLIES. 169 

in the tomatoes, and boil them gently till the sirup appears 
to have penetrated them. In about a week, turn off the 
sirup, scald it, and turn it back. Thus preserved, tomatoes 
appear like West India sweetmeats. 

517. Tomato Marmalade, 

Take full grown tomatoes while quite green, cut out the 
stems, stew them till soil, rub them through a sieve, set the 
pulp on the fire, seasoned highly with salt, pepper, pounded 
cloves, and garlic, if liked, and stew all together till thick. 
It is excellent for seasoning gravies &c., and keeps well. 

518. Cymlings, or Mock Citron, 

Cut the cymlings, (Virginia squashes,) in rings, or slips, 
and scrape tiiem ; put them in strong salt and water three 
days, then in fair water one day, changing the water sev- 
eral times; soak them in alum water one hour; tie up 
oyster shells in a cloth and boil them with the cymlings till 
the fruit is tender, then take it up and put it back into the 
alum water. Allow for the sirup, a pound and a half of 
loaf sugar to a pound of cymlings ; boil in it some fresh 
lemon cut in slices, and spices to the taste. When cold, 
rinse the cymlings, and boil them about three-quarters of an 
hour. These are good eaten as other sweetmeats, or for 
cake, instead of citron. 

Preserve watermelon rinds in the same manner. Tie 
up with clarified or brandy paper. 

519. Raspberry J Blackberry, and Strawberry Jam, 

For each pound of fruit allow a pound of sugar ; make 
alternate layers of sugar and tferries in your preserving 
dish ; let them remain half an hour, then boil them slowly 
about half an hour, stirring them frequently. Put a little in 
a cup, and set it in a dish of cold water for trial. Boil till 
it becomes the consistency of thick jelly. 

520. Calf s Feet Jelly, 

Take four scalded feet, perfectly clean; boil them in 
four quarts of water till reduced to one, or till they are very 
tender ; take them from the fire and let them remain till

porfectly cold ; then take off all the fat, and scrape off ths 
dregs that stick to the jelly. Put it in a preserving kettle, 
and place it on a slow (ire. On melting, take it from the 
lire ; mix with it, half a pint of white wine, the juice and 
grated rind of two fresh lemons, and a stick of cinnamon, 
or blade of mace. Wash and wipe dry six eggs ; stir the 
whites, beaten to a froth, into the jelly when cold ; bruise 
the shells and add them ; then set it on a few coals ; when 
hot, sweeten to the taste. Let all boil slowly fifteen min« 
utes, without stirring it ; then suspend a flannel bag, and 
let the jelly drain through it into a pitcher or deep dish. 
If it is not clear, wash the bag and pass it through till it is 
perfectly so. Do not squeeze the bag. When transparent, 
turn it into glasses, and set them, if die weather is hot, into 
cold water, and keep them in a cool place. It will keep 
but a few days in warm MTeather. 

Some take eight calf's feet, a pint of white wine, three 
lemons,, the whites of six eggs, half an ounce of cinnamon, 
half a pound of loaf sugar, with only three quarts of water, 
and proceed in a similar way, adding two spoonfuls of 
French brandy, and reduce the whole to one quart. 

A knuckle of veal, and sheep's feet make a nice jelly 
When jelly is perfectly congealed, dip the mould an instant 
into boiling water, to loosen it. 

521. Lemon Jelly, 

Set on a slow fire a pint of water, with one ounce of rins* 
ed isinglass, in small pieces, and the rind of six lemons ; stir 
constantly till the isinglass is dissolved ; add a pint of lemon 
juice, and sweeten it to the taste, with loaf sugar. Boil 
all, four or five minutes ; color with the tincture of saffron, 
and pass it through a flannel bag, without squeezing it. Fill 
your jelly glasses with it when partly cool. • 

52^. Strawberry, Raspberry, and Blackberry Jelly. 

The jellies of all these berries are made in a similar 
manner. Take the berries when ripe, and such as are 
prime, mash them, and let them drain through a flannel bag 
without squeezing it. Put to a pint of the juice, a pound 
of loaf sugar and one third of the white of- an egg ; set it 



SWEETMEATS AND JELLIES. 171 

on the fire ; on boiling up well, remove it from the fire and 
skim it clear ; set it back ; if inore scum rises,* remove it 
from the fire again, and skim it off. Boil till it becomes a 
jeUy. If, when cold, on dropping it into a tumbler of cold 
water it falls to the bottom in solid form, it is jellied. Tie 

up with claritied or brandy paper. 

» 

523. Cranberry^ Grape, and Currant, Jelly, 

Wash, and drain the fruit till nearly dry ; put it in an 
earthen jar ; put the jar in a kettle of water ; set the kettle 
where the water will boil, taking care that none of it gets 
into the jar. When the fruit breaks, pour it into a flannel bag 
to drain, without squeezing it. When strained, add to each 
pint of juice, a pound and a half of white sugar, and half 
the beaten white of an eg^. Boil the sirup gently, taking 
it back from the fire as fast as any scum rises, and skim it 
clear. After boiling fiflfeen or twenty minutes, drop a tea- 
spoonful of it, cold, into a tumbler of water, to ascertain if 
it is jelly. Jellies are improved by being set in the sun a 
few days. Currant jelly is best made of equal quantities 
of white and red currants. The juice of black currants re- 
quires but about half the sugar, and half the time to boil it 
that the red does. 

524. Apple and Quince Jelly. Seepage 194. 

Crab apples make the nicest apple jelly. Wash them, 
cut out the defects, the stem, the blossom end, and the 
seeds, quartering the apples, but neither pare them, nor 
take out the hulls ; lay them in your preserving kettle ; and 
put to them just sufficient water to cover them. Boil till 
soft, but not till they break. Drain off the water through 
a colander ; mash the apples with the back of a spoon ; put 
them in a jelly bag, place a deep dish under it, and squeeze 
out the juice. To every pint of juice, allow a pound of loaf 
sugar; boil slowly, skimming it well, about ten or twenty 
minutes, or until it is a jelly. Dip it out while boiling, with 
a silver spoon, into your tumblers and moulds ; cover with 
a prepared paper, and tie another paper close over the glass 
Quince jelly is made in the same way. Pippins and bell 
flowers make good jelly. Add lemon peel if you like. 



172 COMMON DRINKS. 

525. Molaawes Camdff. 

Take two quarts of West India molasses, one poaml of 
blown sugar, and the juice of two large lemons, or a tea* 
spoonful of strong essence of lemon; mix, and boil the 
molasses and sugar three hours, orer a moderate fire, (when 
done it will cease boiling, and be crisp when cold.) While 
boiling, stir it frequendj, inserted m a tin pau. After 
boiling two hours and a half, stir in the lemon juice. It 
will be improYed by grating in the yeUow part of the rind 
so fine as not to be visible when boiled. If the lemon is 
put in too soon, all the taste will be boiled out. When it 
is quite done, butter a square tin pan, and turn the mixture 
in to cool. If you prefer the candy with ground nuts, roast 
a quart of them, shell and blanch them, and stir them in 
gradually, a few minutes before you take it from the fire 
Almonds may be blanched, cut in pieces, and stirred in raw, 
when the sugar and molasses hare just done boiling. If 
you wish to make it yellow, take some out of the tin pan 
while it is yet warm, and pull it out into a thick string, be- 
tween the thumb and fore-finger of both hands. Extend 
your arms widely as you pull the candy backwards and 
forwards. By repeating this a long time, it will gradually 
become of a light yellow color, and of a spongy consistency. 
When it is quite yellow, roll it into sticl^, twist two sticks 
together, and cut them off smoothly at both ends. Or you 
may variegate it by twisting together a stick that is quite 
yellow and one that remains brown. 

526. Coffee. 

Old Java and Mocha are the best kinds. Cofiee should 
be dried in an iron pot, over a moderate fire, for some hours 
before it is roasted. Hang the pot so high as not to bum 
it. After drying three or four hours, place it on a hot bed 
of coals, and stir it constantly until roasted enough, which 
is determined by biting one of the lightest colored kernels. 
If brittle, pronounce the whole done. Put into two or three 
pounds a bit of butter as big as a walnut, before taking it 
off. Box it tight, immediately, to keep in the steam. A 
coffee roaster is ^e best thing to roast coffee in. It con- 
lines the fine aromatic fiavor of the coffee, which otherwise 



COMMON DRINKS. 173 

escapes with the steam. For good common coffee, allow 
from one to two spoonfuls, ground, to a pint of water. Pour 
the water on boiling hot, and boil it in a cofiee pot, from 
twenty to twenty-five minutes. It will not taste fresh and 
lively, if boiled longer. Let it stand, after removed from 
the fire, four or five miflutes to settle, then turn it off care- 
fully from the grounds, into an urn or coffee pot. When 
the coffee is put on the fire to boil, put a piece of isinglass, 
or fish skin, the size of a dime, into it, or the white and 
shell of an egg, for two quarts of coffee. Many dislike to 
fine coffee with fish skin, thinking it imparts an unpleasant 
taste ; but it will not, if prepared properly. Take the skin 
from mild codfish that has not been soaked, as soaking de- 
stroys its effects ; rinse it in cold water, and dry it perfectly, 
it may be done in the oven after drawing the bread ; when 
dry, cut it into pieces of the size of a dime, and keep them 
in a paper bag for use. Put one of these dime-pieces into 
from a quart to two quarts of coflfee, when you set it on the 
fire to boil. If you cannot get cream for your coffee, boil 
the coffee with less water, and weaken it with boiling milk, 
when served out in cups. 

Some cooks say, allow two spoonfuls of fresh roasted 
cofifee for each person ; grind it just before making ; put it 
in a basin, and break into it the white, yolk, and shell of 
one egg ; mix it up with a spoon to the consistency of a 
thick pulp ; put warm, not boiling, water in the coflfee pot ; 
place, and let it stand on the fire, till it boils up and breaks 
three times. Then take it oflf and let it stand a few min- 
utes, and it will be as clear as amber, and the egg will give 
it a rich taste. 

527. French Method of Preparing Coffee. 

Divide the quantity to be roasted into two parts ; roast 
one part in a coffee roaster, turn it constantly, till the coffee 
is the color of dried almonds, and has lost one eighth of its 
weight. Roast the other part, till the color of chestnuts, 
and it has lost one-fifth of its weight. Roast and grind 
your cpflTee the day it is to be used ; mix the two parts, and 
grind them in a cofiee mill. To two ounces of ground coffee 
put four cups of cold water ; draw this off, and set it one

side. Put to the same coffee, three cups of boiling water; 
draw this off and add it to the cold infusion. When wanted, 
heat it quickly, in a silver coffee pot. Do not let it boil > 
the perfume will be lost by evaporation. Do not make the 
coffee in a tin vessel. Make it in China, delft-ware, or in 
silver. % 

528. Coffee Cream. 

Mix three cups of nice clear coffee, and sugar to the 
taste, and boil with a pint of cream till reduced about one 
third. 

529. Cocoa SheUs. 

Put your shells soaking over night ; then boil them in 
the same water in the morning. They are healthful and 
cheap. 

530. Chocolate. 

Allow to each square, or spoonful, of fine scraped choco- 
late, about a pint of water ; boil from fifteen to twenty min- 
utes, then add cream, or milk, and sugar to the taste, and 
boil it, uncovered, about ten minutes longer. 

531. Tea. 

Scald the tea-pot, and put in a teaspoonful to a person, il 
the tea is strong ; if it is a weak kind, put in more ; turn 
on just sufficient boiling water to cover your tea, and let it 
steep — green tea, five or six minutes, (if longer it will not 
be lively,) and black tea, ten or twelve minutes. Fill up 
your tea-pot with boiling water, on carrying it to the table ; 
and keep your tea-kettle boiling, to fill up your tea-pot as 
it may want— careful not to have smoky tea. Black tea is 
more healthful than green. Hyson and souchong, half and 
half, is a pleasanter and more healthful beverage, for such as 
drink strong tea, than green alone. 

532. Eau Sucre. 

Sweeten boiling water with sugar to your taste. This 
beverage is considered soporific ; is good for weak nerves; 
and is much used by French ladies. 



COMMON DltlMKS. 175 

533. Currant Wine. 

Mix one quart of strained currant juice, with two quarts 
of water, and three pounds of sugar. After stirring the 
whole together, let it rest twenty-four hours ; then skim, 
and set it in a cool place, where it will ferment slowly. At 
Ihe end of three or four days, or when fermentation has 
about ceased, close up the barrel tight, which should be full. 
When it becomes clear, bottle it. 

534. Grape Wine. 

Tp each' gallon of bruised perfectly ripe grapes, add a 
gallon of water, and let the whole stand a week ; then draw 
off the liquor, and put to every gtfUon three pounds of lump 
sugar. When fermentation, in a temperate situation, is 
about over, gftop it. close. In about six months bottle it. 

535. To Mull Wine. 

Put a teaspoonful of powdered cloves and cinnamon to a 
pint of water ; place it where it will boil ; then separate the 
yolks and whites of three eggs, and beat the yolks with a 
spoonful of powdered sugar. When the water boils, turn 
it on the yolks and sugar ; add a pint of wine, and pour the 
beaten whites of the eggs over the whole. 

536. Gingtr Wine. 

To three gallons of water, put three pounds of sugar, 
and four ounces of race ginger, washed perfectly clean ; 
boil them one hour, and then strain through a sieve. When 
lukewarm, put it in a cask with three lemons cut in slices, 
and half a pint of beer yeast. Mix it well together, and 
make the cask tight. After fermenting about a week, or 
till clear, bottle it. It may then be used in about ten days 

537. Orgeat. — An Excellent Refreshment for Parties. 

Boil two quarts of milk with a stick of cinnamon, and let 
it stand to be quite cold, taking out the cinnamon. Blanch 
four ounces of the best sweet almonds ; pound them in a 
marble mortar, with a little rose-water; mix them mcU

with the milk ; sweeten it to yoar taste ; let it boil only a 
few minutes ; strain it through a very fine sieve till quite 
smooth, and free from the almonds ; and serve it up either 
cold or lukewarm, in handled glasses. 

^ 538. Sherbet. • 

Boil in three pints of water, six or eight stalks of green 
rhubarb, and four ounces of raisins or figs ; when the wa- 
ter has boiled about half an hour, strain it, and mix it with 
a teaspoonfiil of rose-water, and orange or lemon sirup to 
the taste. Drink it cold. 

539. Cherry Shrub. 

Pick ripe Morello cherries from the stem ; put them in 
an earthen pot ; place that in an iron pot of water ; boil till 
the juice is extracted ; strain it through a cloth thick enough 
to retain the pulp, and sweeten it to your taste. When 
perfectly clear, bottle it, sealing the cork. By first putting 
a gill of brandy into each bottle, it will keep through the 
summer. It is delicious mixed with water. 

540. Currant Shrub. 

To a pound of sugar, add a pint of strained currant juice ; 
boil it gently eight or ten minutes, skimming it well ; take it 
off; and when lukewarm, add half a gill of brandy to eve- 
ry pint of shrub. Botfle tight. 

541. Raspberry Shrub. 

Put one quart of vinegar to three quarts of ripe raspber- 
ries ; after standing a day, strain it, adding to each pint a 
pound of sugar, and skim it clear, while boiling about half 
an hour. Put a wineglass of brandy to each pint of the 
shrub, when cool. Two spoonfuls of this mixed with a 
rumbler of water, is an excellent drink in fevers. 

542. Lemon Shrub. 

Pare a thin rind off from fresh lemons ; squeeze om 
and strain the juice ; put to a pint of it, a pound of sugar

broken in small pieces ; take for each pint of the sirup three 
spoonfuls of brandy, and soak the rind of the lemon in it. 
Let all stand one day, frequently stirring up the lemon juice 
and sugar. Next day pour off the sirup, and mix it with 
the brandy and lemon rinds. Keep it under sealed corks, 
in dry sand, in a cool place. 

543. Lemonade. 

Mix the juice of two lemons with a pint of water, siyeet- 
ening to the taste. Some like nutmeg grated on it, or 
some of the squeezed lemon cut in it. 

544. Common Beer, 

Allow at the rate of two gallons of water to a handfnl of 
hops, a little fresh spruce, or sweet fern, and a quart of 
bran ; boil it two or three hours ; strain it through a sieve ; 
stir in, while hot, a teacup of molasses to each gallon of 
hquor ; let it stand till lukewarm ; turn it into a clean bar- 
rel ; add a pint of good yeast to the barrel ; shake it well 
together, and it may be used next day. 

545. Spring Beer. 

Take a small bunch of sweet fern, sarsaparilla, winter- 
green, sassafras, prince's pine, cumfrey root, burdock root, 
nettle root, Solomon's seal, spice bush, and black birch ; 
boil part, or all of them, in three or four gallons of water, 
with two or three ounces of hops, and two or three raw 
potatoes, pared- and cut in slices. Their strength is bet- 
ter extracted by boiling in two waters, for when the liquor is 
saturated with the hops, it will rather bind up the roots than 
extract their juices. Boil the roots five or six hours ; strain 
the liquor ; and add a quart of molasses to three gallons 
ef beer. To have the beer very rich, brown half a pound 
of bread and put it into the liquor. If the liquor is too thick, 
dilute it with cold water. When lukewarm, put in a pint of 
fresh lively yeast. Place it in a temperate situation, cover- 
ed, but not so closely as to retard fermentation. After fer 
mentation, bottle it close, or keep it in a tight keg.

546. Lemon Beer. 



*Vo a gallon of water, add a sliced lemon, a spoonful of 
ginger, naif a pint of yeast, and sugar enough to make it 
quite sweet. 

547. Hop Beer. 

Tyrn ^ve quarts of water on six ounces of hops ; boil 
three hours ; strain off the liquor; turn on four quarts more 
of water, and twelve spoonfuls of ginger, and boil the hops 
three hours longer ; strain, and mix it with the other liquor, 
and stir in two quarts of molasses. Brown very dry half 
a pound of bread, and put in — ^rusked bread is best. Pound 
it fine, and brown it in a pot, like coffee. Afler cooling to 
be about lukewarm, add a pint of new yeast that js free 
from salt. Keep the' beer covered, in a temperate situa- 
tion, till fermentation has ceased, which is known by the 
settling of the froth ; then turn it into a keg or bottles, and 
keep it in a cool place. 

548. Ginger Beer. - 

Turn two gallons of boiling water on two pounds of brown 
sugar, or to a quart of molasses, one and a half ounces of 
cream of tartar, and the same of ginger ; stir them well, and 
put it into a cask. When milk warm, put in half a pint of 
good yeast, stopping the cask close, and shaking it well. 
Bottle it in about twenty four hours. In ten days it will 
sparkle like Champaigne. One or two lemons sliced in, 
will much improve it. It is excellent in warm weather. 

549. Quick Ginger Beer. 

To a pail of water, add two ounces of ginger, one pin 
of molasses, and a gill of good yeast. In two hours it ia 
fit for use. 

550. Spruce Beer. 

Boil one nandful of hops, and two of the chips of sassa- 
fras root, in ten gallons of water ; strain it, and turn on, 
while hot, a gallon of mdlasses, two spoonfuls of the essence 
of spruce, two spoonfuls of ginger, and one of pounded all 
spice. Put it into a cask : and when cold enough, add 



ESSENCES. 170 

half a pint of good yeast ; stir it well ; stop it close ; when 
clear, bottle and cork it. 

551. Beer of Essential Oils, 

Mix two quarts of boiling water with a pint and a half, 
of molasses ; stir in five quarts of cold water, ten drops of 
the oil of sassafras, ten of spruce, fifteen of wintergreen, 
and a teaspoonful of the essence of ginger ; when luke- 
warm, turn in half a pint of fresh lively yeast. After fer- 
mented, bottle and cork it, and keep it where cool. It may 
be used in two or three days. 

\ 552. Essence of Lemon, 

Turn gradually two ounces of strong rectified spirit on a 
drachm of the best oil of lemons. But the best way of ob- 
taining the essence of lemon peel, is to rub all the yellow 
part of the peel off, with lumps of white sugar, and scrape 
off the surface of the sugar into a preserving pot, as fast as 
it becomes saturated with the oil of the lemon. Press the 
sugar close, and cover it tight. A little of this sugar im- 
parts a fine flavor to puddings, pies, and cakes. This is 
the preferable mode of obtaining and preserving the essence 
of lemon. You have the fine aromatic flavor of the peel, 
without the alloy of the spirit. 

553. Essence of Ginger: 

Grate, and put into a quart of French brandy, three ounces 
of fresh ginger, with the yellow part of the rind of a fresh 
lemon ; shake it up well, and daily, ten days, when it may 
be used. It is nice for flavoring many kinds of sweetmeats ; 
and a little of it mixed with water, or put on a piece of su- 
gar, subserves all the purposes of ginger tea, and is far more 
palatable. 

554. Rose'Water. 

On a dry day, gather fragrant, full-blown roses ; pick 
odf the leaves ; to each peck put a quart of water ; put the 
whole in a cold still, and set the still on a moderate fire— 
the slower they are distilled, the better will be the rose* 
water. Bottle the water immediately after it is distilled

555. Aromatic Vinegar, 

Mix with a spoonful of vinegar powdered chalk suffi- 
cient to destroy its acidity ; let it settle ; turn off the vine- 
gar from the chalk with care, and dry it. To purify an 
infected room, put in a few drops of sulphuric acid. The 
fumes arising from it will purify a room where there has 
been any infectious disorder. In using it, be very careftd 
not to inhale the fumes, or to soil your gannents with the 
acid. It will corrode whatever it touches. 

556. To Extract the Essential Oil of Flowers. 

Take a quantity of fresh, fragrant leaves, both the stalk 
and flower leaves ; cord very tltin layers of cotton, and dip 
them in fine Florence oil ; put alternate layers of the cot- 
ton and leaves in a glass jar, or large tnmbler ; sprinkle a 
very little fine salt on each layer of the flowers ; cover the 
jar close, and place it in a window exposed to the sun. 
In two weeks a fragrant oil may be squeezed out of the cot-, 
ton. Rose leaves, mignonette, and sweet scented clover, 
make nice perfumes. 

557. Cologne Water. 

Pour a quart' oT alcohol gently on the following oils:— 
on two drachms of the oil of rosemary, two of the oil of 
lemon, or orange-flower water, one drachm of lavender, ton 
drops of cinnamon, and a tea-spoonful of rose-water. Stop aU 
tight in a bottle ; shake it up well. 

Another way. Put into a quart of highly rectified spirits 
of wine, the following oils :-^wo drachins of oil of lemon, 
two of rosemary, one of lavender, two of bergamot, ten 
drops of cinnamon, ten of cloves, two of roses, and eight 
of the tincture of cinnamon. If wished very strong,- put 
double the quantity of oils to a pint only of the spirits. 

558. Perfume Bags. 

Take rose and sweet scented clover leaves, dried in the 
shade, then mixed with powdered mace, cloves, and cinna- 
mon, and pressed in small bags, and lay the bags ia chests

of linen, or in drawers of clothes. They make a nice 
perfume; 

559. Lavender Water. 

Pour a pint of alcohol moderately to an ounce and a half 
of the oil of lavender, and two drachms of ambergris. Keep 
it in a bottle tightly corked ; shake it up well on putting it in. 

560. To Extract a Clove, Bean, or any Artificial Substance ^ 

from the Nose of a Child. 

• Press with the finger the well nostril, so as to completely 
close it, at the same time fitting your lips to the child's 
closely ; blow with a sudden puff into the child's mouth. 
The writer thus extracted a clove from the nose of a young 
child. t 

561. To Prevent the Quinsy, or Swollen Glands, and to 

Cure Sore Throat. 

-Apply freely, daily, or every time of washing the face, 
cold water under the chin and about the neck. The efi!ect 
has been witnessed. It is a sure preventive. The tooth- 
ache too will be a rare visitor, and probably a total stranger. 
Wash your children daily and thoroughly in cold water, as 
the best preventive of colds. 

For sore throat, drink a tumbler of molasses and water, 
half and half, on going to bed, bathing the feet and applying 
mustard drafts ; rub your throat with a mixture of sweet or 
goose oil and spirits of turpentine, or salt and lard ; then 
wear flannel. Turn your woollen stocking, and apply foot 
part next the throat, when going to bed, is recommended. 

562. For the Erysipelas. 

Take three ounces of sarsaparilla rOot, two of burdock 
root, three of the bark of sweet ozier, two of cumfrey root, 
two of the bark of the root of bittersweet, three of prince's 
pine, two of black alder bark, and two handfuls of low mal- 
lows leaves, and put all in fotir quarts of pure, soft, water ; 
steep half away; strain it; add half a pint of molasses, and 
four ounces of good figs, and boil the mixture ten or fifteen 
minutes. Strain it again. When cold, add one pint o 
Holland gin. Take a wineglass three times a*day.

ming off the turpentine as it rises ; strain it through a thick 
cloth ; add a pint of molasses, or a pound of loaf sugar ; 
boil it in ; strain it again, into an earthen vessel ; add one 
gill of the best of Cogniac brandy, or such other spirit as 
may be preferred, and bottle it. Give from half a wine- 
glass to a full one, as the patient can bear it, three times a 
day. It is excellent for any cough.

of gymson seed into a pint bottle ; fill the bottle with the 
fine chips of a pitch pine knot ; then fill it with strong alco- 
hol. In three days the virtue of the chips and of the seed 
will be extracted, the alcohol turning of a greenish color. 
Bathe the parts affected a few times, and it will destroy the 
pain. A decoction of wormwood, or the bruised leaves, 
moistened and applied, is a good application for a bruise or 
sprain.

turpentine in a teacup : set the teacup in hot water ; wet 
flannels in it, and apply to the throat quite hot. Rub the 
feet and hands with it, instead of a fiesh brush. Or, simmer 
garlics in pig's foot oil, or lard ; rub it on the throat and 
stomach freely, and bind the garlics on the feet : — Or, most 
excellent : Bathe the feet in warm water immediately, rub- 
bing them well ; give a teaspoonful of skunk's oil if you

a cabbage leaf, and pulverize it. Take the same quantity 
of shaving soap, and the same of bar soap, and make adl 
into a very smooth salve ; soak the felon in lye ; apply the 
salve ; in twenty-four hours, pare down where it looks like 
breaking, till you open it ; put on basilicon salve. 

576. For Cholera Morbus,

To make the gruel of rice flour, mix a spoonful of it 
smoothly with three of cold water, and stir it into a quart 



REMEDIES AND COOKERY FOR TI STCR. 185 

of boibng water. Boil* five or six minutes, stirring it con 
stantly. Season with a little salt and pepper, adding nut- 
meg and loaf sugar if liked.-

Mix with one spoonful of wheat flour, Iwo of Indian meal, 
and cold water enough to make a thick batter. Stir it into 
a pint of boiling water, if the gruel is liked thick ; if thin, 
into more water ; boil about forty minutes, putting in a 
little salt and stirring it frequently. Take it off the fire, 
and add a little salt and butter, and pour it on small pieces 
of toasted bread. 

580. Barley Water. 

Boil till soft two ounces of barley in two quarts of water. 
Pearl barley is preferred. Strain and mix it with enough 
currant jelly to give it a pleasant taste. 

If the jelly is not preferred, turn the boiled barley to two 
ounces of figs or raisins, and boil all till reduced to one 
quart ; strain and use it. 

581. Caudle. 

To rice or water gruel made as above and strained, add 
half a wineglass of wine, brandy, or ale ; and season it with 
loaf sugar and nutmeg. 

582. Wine, Vinegar, and other Wheys. 

Stir into » pint of boiling milk, two glasses of wine ; boil 
it one minute ; take it from the fire ; let it stand till the curd

186 BEMEDIES AND COOKERY FOR THE 81CK. 

is excellent food for invalids, and -can be eaten when the 
custards are too rich for the stomach. 

684. Thoroughwort Bitters, 

Make a' strong tea of thoroughwort ; strain it ; when 
cool, put to two quarts of it half a pint of French brandy, 
the peel of two or three fresh oranges, cut in small bits, and 
six bunches of fennel or smellage seed. Turn the tea and 
brandy on the peel and seed in a bottle, and cork it tight. 
The bitters will keep good a long time ; they are excellent 
for bilious complaints, and can -often be taken when thor- 
oughwort tea will not suit the stomach. Put a wineglass 
of the bitters to a tumbler of water, adding a little sugar at 
the time of drinking them. 

585. Stomachic Tincture. 

Bruise one ounce of dried bitter orange peel, with two of 
Peruvian bark ; steep them two weeks in a pint of proof 
spirit, shaking up the bottle once or twice daily. Let it 
remain quiet two days, then turn it off carefully into another 
bottle. A teaspoonful, in a wineglass of water, is a good 
tonic. 

^ 586. Tapioca Jelly. 

Rinse four spoonfuls of tapioca thoroughly, covering it 
with cold water ; soak it five hours. Put a pint of cold 
water on the fire ; when it boils, mash and stir up the 
tapioca that is in water, and mix it with the boiling water ; 
simmer all gently with a stick of cinnamon or mace ; when 
thick and clear, mix two spoonfnls of white sugar with half 
a spoonful of lemon juice, and half a glass of white wine ; 
stir it into the jelly ; add more sugar, if not sweet enough, 
and turn the jelly into cups. 

587. Moss Jelly. 
Steep Carragua or Irish moss in cold water a few min- 
utes, to extract its bitter taste ; turn off the water ; to half 
an ounce of moss add a quart of fresh water and a stick of 
cinnamon. Boil it till a thick jelly ; strain it, and season 
it to the taste with loaf sugar and white wine. This is 
highly recommended for consumptive complaints, and is 
A cry nourishing 



KEMKDIES AND COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 187 

588. Sago Jelly, 

Soak four ounces of sago in cold water half an hour, 
after thoroughly rinsed ; pour it off; turn on a jpint and a 
half of fresh cold water; soak it half an hour ; then boil it 
slowly with a stick of cinnamon, stirring it constantly. 
When of a thick consistency, add a glass of wine, and loaf 
sugar to the taste. Boil it .five minutes, and turn it into 
cups. 

589. Beef Tea. 

Boil a pound of fresh lean beef ten minutes ; cut it in 
small bits ; pour on a pint of boiling water ; let it steep, 
where warm, half an hour ; then strain and season the tea 
with salt and pepper. This, though a quick way, is not so 
good as the following, when the stomach can bear but a 
little liquid : — Cut the beef, quite free of fat, into small bits ; 
fill a junk bottle with them, cork it tight, immerse it in a 
kettle of lukewarm water, and boil it four or five hours. 
In this way, you obtain the juices of the meat unalloyed 
with water. A spoonful of this, is as nourishing as a tea- 
cup of the other. 

590. For the Dysentery, 

Bruise one ounce of rhubarb, two drachms of English 
safiiron, two of cardamom seed, and a large nutmeg ; add to 
them a pint of best French brandy ; set the bottle, loosety 
corked, in a pot of c<^d water ; heat the water over a mod- 
erate fire quite hot, and keep it hot twelve hours, without 
boiling. It is then fit for «se. Take, on going to bed, one 
spoonful — a teaspoonful i^||^ child. 

. 591. For Weakness, 

Put to a pint of best port wine, one ounce of steel filings* 
and one ounce of cinnamon. Place the bottle twenty-four 
hours in the corner, often shaking it : — take in the day, 
three teaspoonfuls, one at a time. 

592. To prevent the Lockjaw, 

As this is often caused by treading on a nail or pin, and 
subsequent neglect — forthwith bind on a rind of salt pork. 
Ifthe foot swell, bathe it in strong wormwood tea, and bind 
on another pork rind : — rest till healed. Or, soak the limb

bing it m cold water ; cover it with cold water, and sUiep it 
two hours ; then bruise or cut it, and turn on boiling water, 
and steep it three or four days, and turn off the water by 
pressure. Put the liverwort into a quart of fresh, water, and 
reduce it by boiling to about a pint. After strained and 
cooled, it is free from any bitter taste, and makes a thick 
mucilage. It is palatable, by adding sugar and lemon acid, 
or white wine, where wine may be used ; and it is an excel- 
lent demulcent nutriment in dysentery, consumption, and in 
convalescence from acute diseases, especially after the 
hooping cough, in which case its bitter need be but partially 
extracted. 

598. Bread Water, 

Brown thoroughly thin pieces of bread on both sides, 
without burning it, and turn boiling water over it and let 
it cool. 

599. Cooling Drinks. 

Turn boiling water on preserves, roasted sour apples, or 
lemons sliced ; or boil lemon juice in sugar and water. 

600. Licorice, Flax-seed, Boneset, Pennyroyal, Mint, Balm, ' 

and other Teas, 

Put the seeds or herbs into a pitcher ; turn on boiling 
water ; cover and set it near the fire till sufficiently strong. 
Mint tea is good for allaying nausea and vomiting. Seep. 1 94. 

601. For a Cut. 

For a slight cut, only put on dry linen lint, bandaging it 
moderately tight. Uniting the lips with an adhesive plas- 
ter, or by stiching, will make a cut heal more readily. In 
slight cuts, the lint need not be removed. In others, after 
two or three days, a plaster of basilicon, or some other 
salve may be needed. Apply the salve, spread on lint, oi 
a fine rag, directly ; or over a thin dressing of dry lint. 

602. Madder Red, and Crimson Dyes 

For one pound of goods, allow three ounces of alum, one 
of cream of tartar, and eight of madder. Bring to a scald? 
ing heat, three gallons of water in a hrs^^s )^ett)e : SK^d th^

alum and tartar ; let it boil ; then put in the goods, and boil 
them two hours. Take out and rinse them in clear water. 
Empty the kettle ; put in again three gallons of water ; add 
the 'madder ; (it may be tied up in a bag) rub it fine in the 
water ; pat in the goods, and let them remain one hour in 
the dye, which must not boil, but be kept at a scalding heat. 
Keep the goods in motion, and when they have been in one 
hour, let diem boil Gve minutes ; then take them out, stir 
and rinse them out well, without wringing, and dry them in 
the shade. For a crimson dye, take for each pound of 
goods, two and a half ounces of alum, and an ounce and an 
half of white tartar ; put them in a brass kettle with water 
enough to cover the goods ; boil them briskly a few min- 
utes ; then put in the goods, washed clean and rinsed in 
fair water. When the goods have boiled half an hour, take 
them out without wringing, and hang them where they will 
cool all over alike, without drying ; empty out the alum and 
tartar water ; put fresh water in the kettle, and for each 
pound of goods, put in an ounce of cochineal, powdered 
fine. Afl6r the water has boiled fifteen or twenty minutes, 
reduce it to a lukewarm temperature, by adding cold water ; 
then put in the goods and boil them an hour and a quarter. 
Take them out without wringing, and dry them in the 
shade. Balm of Gilead hlossoms, steeped in fair water, 
then strained, make a pretty red dye for silks. The silk 
must be free of color, washed clean, rinsed, and boiled in 
the strained dye, with a small lump of alum. For faded 
fancy shawls and ribbons, use a carmine saucer, to color a 
fine delicate pink ; the directions come with the saucers. 

603. Blue Black Dye. 

Wet in strong suds a pound of goods, and wring them 
dry ; put into a thin cloth bag a pound of ground logwood, 
and put this into sufiicient vinegar or sour cider, to cover 
the goods, and hang it where it will keep warm several 
hours, boiling it a few minutes at the last. Put in your 
goods, and let them remain in the dye two or three days, 
without boilingf airing them daily. Take your goods out of 
the warm dye, spread them evenly in the shade to dry, and 
then wa9h them out in strong suds. 



COMMON DVES. 191 

604. Black Dye, 

Take for a pound of goods a pound of logwood. Soak 
the logwood in soft water over night ; boil it an hour, and 
strain the water. Allow for each pound of logwood an 
ounce of blue .vitriol ; dissolve the vitriol in enough luke- 
warm water to wet the goods ; dip the goods in ; when sat- 
urated, turn the whole into the logwood dye. If the goods 
are cotton, place the vessel on the £re, and let the goods 
boil ten or fifteen minutes, stirring them constantly to pre- 
sent their spotting. For silk and woolen goods, do not boil 
the dye stuff. Only keep it at a scalding heat for twenty 
minutes. Drain the goods without wringing, and hang them 
in a shady, but dry airy place. When dry, put the goods 
into scalding water, with one teacup of salt to three gallons 
of the water. Let the goods be in it till cold, then hang 
theni to dry, without wringing, Boiling hot suds is the best 
thing to set the color of black silk ; let it be in till cold. 
Sour milk is good to soak goods in, to set a black dye. 

605. Slate Colored Dye. 

Boil sugar-loaf paper with vinegar, in an iron vessel, 
adding alum to set the color. This makes a good dark 
ftlate color. Tea grounds, set with copperas, also. For a 
light slate color, boil in a brass vessel, white maple bark in 
clear water, adding a little alum. The dye for slate color 
should be strained before putting in the goods. They 
should be boiled in it ; then hung gut to drain and dry. 

606. Yelhw Dyes. 

For a buff color, boil equal parts of common potash and 
anatto in pure soft water. When dissolved, take it from 
the fire ; put in the goods when cool, first washed free from 
spots and color ; place them on a moderate fire, where the 
goods will keep hot till of the shade desired. To dye 
orange or salmon color, tie anatto in a bag, and soak it in 
warm soft soap suds, till so sof4 you can squeeze enough 
of it through the bag to make the suds a deep yellow. Put 
in the articles clean and free of color, and boil them till o( 
the shade you wish. Have sufficient dye to cover the 
goods, and stir them while boiling to keep them from spot- 



192 CUM MOM DYES. 

tiDjr. This dye will make a salmon or orange color, ac- 
cording to the strength of it, and the time the goods remain 
in. Drain them out of the dye, and dry them quickly in 
the shade ; then wash them in soft soap suds. Goods dyed 
in this manner should never he rinsed in clear water. 
Peach leaves, fustic, and safiron, all make good straw or 
lemon color, according to the strength of the dye. They 
should be steeped in soft fair water, in tin or earthen, and 
then strained, the dye set with alum, and a little gum-arabic 
dissolved in the dye, if you want to stiffen the article. 
When the dye stuff is strained, steep the articles in it. 

607. Green and Blue Dye for SUks and Woolens. 

To dye green, take a pound of oil of vitriol, and pour it 
on half an ounce of Spanish indigo, that has been reduced 
to a fine powder. Stir them well together ; add a pea- 
sized lump of salaeratus, bottle it as soon as fermentation 
ceases, and you may use it next day. Make chemic blue 
in the same manner, using only half the quantity of vitriol. 
For woolen goods the East indigo answers as well as the 
Spanish, and is cheaper. This dye will not do for cotton 
goods, as the vitriol rots the threads. Wash the articles 
to be colored perfectly clean and free from color. If the 
color cannot be extracted by rubbing in hot suds, boil out 
and rinse in soft water, till entirely free from*soap, as the 
soap will spoil the dye. To dye a pale color, put to each 
quart of soft warm water that is to be used for the dye, ten 
drops of the above composition. To dye a deeper color, 
add more. Put in the articles without crowding, and let 
them remain in till sufficiently dyed. Keep the dye warm ; 
take the articles out without wringing, drain as dry as pos- 
sible, then hang them to dry in a shady airy place. They 
should be dyed in dry weather. Unless dried quick, they 
will not look nice. When perfectly dry, wash them in 
lukewarm suds, to prevent injury of the texture by the vit- 
riol. If you wish a lively bright green, mix a little of the 
above composition with yillow dye. 

608. Beautiful Pink Dye, 

Take three parts cream of tartar, and one of cochineaI» 
nicely rubbed together. Tie a teaspoonful in a muslin bag ; 



SOAPS. 193 

put this with a quart of boiling water ; dip in the articlea 
to be colored, previously cleaned and dipped in ^um water. 
If wished stiff put in a little gum-arabic. « 

609. Cold So€^. 

Mix twenty-six pounds of melted and strained grease, 
with four pailfuls of lye, made of twenty pounds of white 
potash. Let the whole stand in the sun, stirring it fre- 
quently. In the course of the week, fill the barrel with 
weak lye. It is much easier than to make a lye of your 
ashes ; while quite as cheap, if you dispose of your ashes 
to the soap boiler. 

610. Hard Soap. 

Dissolve twenty pounds of white potash in three pailfuls 
of water. With twenty pounds of strained hot grease, mix 
the dissolved potash, and boil them till a thick jelly, which 
is ascertained by examining a little of it taken out and 
cooled. Take it off the fire, stir in cold water till it grows 
thin, then add to each pailful a pint of blown salt, stirring 
it well. Next day remove the lye, and heat it over a slow 
fire ; boil fifteen minutes, and take it off. Put in a little 
palm oil if you wish the soap of a yellow color, and pour 
it into wooden vessels. When cold separate it from the 
lye again, knd cut it into bars. Place them in the sun a 
few days to dry. 

61 1 . Windsor Soap. 

To make the celebrated Windsor soap, — slice the best 
white bar soap as thin as possible, and melt it over a slow 
fire ; then take it off, and when lukewarm, add sufficient 
oil of caraway to scent it, or any other fragrant oil. Pour 
it into moulds, and let it remain five or six days in a dry 
place. 

612. Bayherry^ or Myrtle Soap. 

Dissolve two pounds four ounces of white potash in five 
quarts of water ; mix with it ten pounds of bayberry tallow ; 
boil all over a slow fire till it turns to soap ; add a teacup 
of cold water ; boil it ten minutes longer ; turn it into tin 
moulds for a week or ten days to dry, first scenting it with 
any essential oil that may be preferred. It may be used in

191 80AFS. 

three or four weeks, but is better a year old ; is excellent 
for shaving, fo» chsjpped hands, and for eruptions on the 
face. 

613. Pciask Soap. First rale. 

Put into your soap barrel, sixteen pounds of clean grease , 
sixteen of good potash ; and a pail of boiling water. Stir 
it thoroughly ; and add, daily stirring it several times, a 
pailful of cold or warm water every day, till full. 

614. Cosmetic Soap^for washing the hands. 
Take a pound of castile soap, or any other nice old soap ; 
acrape it fine ; put it on the fire with a little water ; stir it 
to a smooth paste ; turn it into a bowl ; when cold, add 
some lavender water, or any kind of essence : beat it with 
a silver spoon till well mixed ; thicken it with Indian meal, 
and keep it in small pots, closely covered ; exposure to the 
air will harden it. 

615. Superior Soft Soap. 

Cut in small pieces, a pound and a half of bar soap, into 
four quarts of rain water ; add four ounces of pure carbon- 
ate of soda ; dissolve them over the fire, and when dissolved, 
stir in one spoonful of salt : — very nice for woolens and 
calicoes. 



Slbt a. Potato 'Yeast Bread. 

Put into the usual quantity of yeast for four loaves, eight boiled 
mealy potatoes, mashed fine, adding enough water to make the 
whole of yeast-consistency ; let it stand all night, where a little 
warm ; and then rub it through a colander into your flour — much 
improves the bread. 

615, b. Chicken Tea. 

Take off the skin and fat ; cut the fowl in small pieces, and 
boil it till very tender, adding a little salt. Some boil, with it, a 
little wheat flour tied in a muslin bag. Skim off the fat, if any, 
when done. g^g^ ^ 

Molassesj for all kinds of cooking, is much improved by boiling 
and skimming. g.g , 

Use none but a silver spoon for Sweetmeats — dip, with it, your 
Jellies, while boiling, into glasses and moulds.

MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 



CI 6. To extract Tar, Paint, Grease, and Stains from Carpets, 
and the finest fabrics, icithout injury to the texture, or to the 
most delicate colors, — 

Wet soft linen in camphine, and rub the soiled spot till restored ; or, fui 
some articles, rub on beaten egg-yclk, dry in the sun, and wash. 

617. To Preserve different kinds of Fruit through the Winter. 

Take hard sound apples ; wipe them dry, pack them in tight barrels, put- 
ting a layer of bran to each of apples, so as not to let the apples touch each 
other, and you may keep them till June. Keep the barrel m a cool place, 
enveloped in a linen cloth, to prevent the apples freezing. Some lay mortar 
over the top of a barrel of apples to preserve them. It draws the air from 
them, and tnus prevents their decay. Do not let the mortar touch the apples. 
Lemons and oranges may be kept some months, by wrapping such as are per- 
fectly fresh in separate sod papers, and securing them in glass jars, or per- 
fectly tight boxes, packed in white sand dried several hours in the oven after 
baking. Cover each thickly^ then cover the whole so. Close the vessel 
tight, and keep it in a cool dry place. To keep grapes, pick them on a dry 
day before quite dead ripe, reject the bad ones, lav the bunches in a glass 
jar, sprinkle round each a thick layer of dry bran so they shall not touch each 
other, put a thick layer on the top, and cork and seal the jar. By cutting oft 
the extreme end of the stems, on eating them, and placing the stems in sweet 
wme a few minutes, they will so imbibe the wine as to restore the grapes to 
their formei freshness. To keep green grapes, gooseberries, currants, and 
plums, through the winter, fill junk bottles with the fruit, set them in an oven 
six or seven hours after baking ; when the fruit has shrunk, take from one 
bottle to fill the others quite full. Cork and seal tight. To make pies of 
them, put them in a tin pan, cover them with boiling water, stew soft, and 
sweeten them. To keep ripe whortleberries and blackberries, dry them per- 
fectly in the sun, and tie them in bags thick enough to exclude the air. Treat 
them like the green fruit when used. Ripe currants dried on the stem, pick- 
ed off, and put in bags, will keep good for pies all winter. They make a nice 
tea for fevers, especially the hectic. They are excellent to counteract the 
effects of opium. 

618. To make Tomato Ketchup, and to keep Tomatoes and Lima 

Beans through the Winter. 

To one gallon of skinned tomatoes, put four spoonfuls of salt, four of black 
pepper, three of mustard, half a spoonful of allspice, and eight pods of red 
pepper. All the iugrediciits should he made fine, and simmered slowly in a

gathered the better. 

619. Lemon Citron. 

Turn water on nice fresh lemon peels, soak them till you can scru>e all 
the white pulp off, then boil them till soft. Preserve them with hall their 
weight of sugar. They are a good substitute for citron. 

620. Tarragon Vinegar, 

Pick the tarragon nicely from the stems ; let it lay in a dry place two davs ; 
to a (juart of the leaves put in a pitcher, turn three pints ot vinegar ; after 
standing a week, closely covered, strain it ; and when clear, bottle, and cork 
it close. 

621. A Cheap Water Filter. 

Lay a thick bed of pounded charcoal on the bottom of a large common 
earthen flower-pot, and over this lay a bed of fine sand about four inches 
thick. 

622. To Prepare Rennet. 

Take the stomach of a calf as soon as slaughtered ; do not wash it ; hans 
It four or five days in a cool dry place, then turn it inside out, slipping off au 
the curd with the hand ; put in sufficient salt with a little saltpetre, lay it in 
a small stone pot, turn on it a teaspoonful of vinegar, sprinkle over it a hand- 
ful of salt, ana cover it tight. In six or eisht weeks, cut off a piece four 
inches square, put it in a vessel that will hold a pint and a half, add five gills 
of cold water, and one of rose brandy, stop it close, and shake it when about 
to use it. A spoonful is enough for a quart of milk. Well prepared, in cool 
weather, it will keep more than twelve months. Add, if necessai3r, more 
water and salt, as you diminish it For cooking, it is nicer if wine is sub- 
stituted for the vine^ and water. The more common way is, to empty the 
stomach of its curd immediately after the calf is slaughtered, to thorough^ 
salt it inside and out, and to let it lay ir salt one day, and then to stretda it 
on a stick to dry. When dry lay it avsray, and use a little bit as want^

624. To Com Beef, a^nd to " ^alt %n Snow.'" 

Put to each gallon of cold water one quajrt of rock salt, one ounce of salt- 
petre, and four ounces of brown sugar — (you need not boil it)-^d put in 
your beef. As long as any salt remains undissolved, the meat will be sweet. 
If any scum rise, scald and skim the brine, and add more salt, saltpetre, and 
sugar. Rub a piece of meat over with a little salt, on putting it into the 
I trine. If the weather is hot, gash the piece to the bone, and put in salt. Put 
a fiat stone or some weight on the meat, to keep it under brine, and cover the 
cask. Or thus, allowing to every four gsdlons of water two pounds of brown 
vug^ and six pounds of salt, boil it about twenty minutes, taxing off the scum 
as it rises. The next day turn it on your meat packed in Uie pickling tub. 
IPour off this brine, boil and skim it every two months, adding three ouncee 



I 

MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 197 

jf brown sugar and half a pound of common salt. It will keep good a year. 
Sprinkle the meat with salt, and the next day wipe it dry, before turning 
the pickle over it. Let it entirely cover the meat ; add four ounces o( salt- 
petre. Place canvas lids over your salting tubs, to admit the .air and exclude 
flies. For immediate use and for soupy you need only thoroughly rub vour 
pieces of beef or mutton with dry salt, placing them in a closely covered tub 
and turning them daily. You may thus keep mutton and beef sweet six or 
eight weeks. 

'* Salting in snow: — cover the bottom of a large clean tub four inches, with 
nice snow ; lay in yoi«r spare-ribs, fowls, &c., cover each layer two or three 
inches, taking special care to fill siy>w into every crack and craimy betwean 
the j^eces and next the tub, and stuffing the fowls with snow, and topping 
9ff with a layer of snow tight pressed dowiL Cover your tub, and the colder 
its location the better. The meat will remain as fresh and juicy as when 
first killed. It will not freeze. The snow will not melt, unless there come 
a January thaw. 

625. To Salt Pork, 

Pork is said not to be so good for salting for having been kept fat all sum 
mer. Cover the bottom of your barrel with coarse salt. Rock salt is the 
best Put in your meat skin side down, putting a good layer of salt over each 
piece. If salted in the evening after it is slaughtered, it will pack closet 
than after stiffiening by long laying, Make sufficient strong brine to quite 
cover the meat — (if not covered it will be rusty) — by dissolving salt in cold 
water till completely saturated. Boil and skim the brine ; then turn it on 
cold, first putting on a weight to keep the meat compact under brine. Always 
let there be undissolved salt in your pork barrel. What is left will be as 
good as new for the next year. If washed, nothing can be better for butter. 

626. Westphalia Hams — mode of curing them. 

Hang up your hams ten or twelve days — (the longer the tenderer and bet- 
ter if kept perfectly sweet) — then mix, for a common sized ham, a teacup of 
blown salt, a teacup of molasses, and one ounce of saltpetre ; lay the hams 
in a clean dry tub, rub them all over with the mixture, and rub the bone ef- 
fectually. Turn and rub the hams daily, for three weeks, occas^nally rub- 
bing on a little blown salt. Nothing can be better if rightly smoked. Use 
com cobs for smoking. Hickory and apple-tree wood arc good. Do not heat 
your hams. 

627. Virginia Mode of Curing Hams, 

Add salt to water so long as it will dissolve ; for every sixteen pounds of 
ham, add to your pickle two teaspoonfuls of salsaratus, and two ounces of 
saltpetre, adding also a gallon of molasses to every hogshead of brine. Let 
the hams lie in this pickle three or four weeks. Smoke them from one to 
three months. To retain the juices, smoke with the hock downwards. 

628. Western Mode of Curing Hams, 

Let the hams remain as for " Westphalia Hams," so long as they will keep 
sweet, after the pork is cut out ; then rub around the bone of each ham a 
teaspoonful of saltpetre, and pack them in fine salt, half a bushel to five hun 
dred weight. Let them lay one month. (If they settle, they are doing well. 
If the V rise, take them up, and add more salt.) Then taking them out, rub 
withtne hand all over the fleshy part of the ham, a paste made of good ashes 
wet up with water — th<!if^prepared, the flies will not trouble them. Smoke 
them, hock downwards. 

629. A Cheap Smoke House, 
Take a barrel or hogshead, and knock out both heads, and smoke your n: tat

or fish in iL Be careful of your fire. Put a few einbers in a miitable reaael, 
•ay on them a few cobs ; the cobs may occasionallT be sprinkled with water; 
suspend your meat from sticks laid across the cask, covering it so as to con- 
fine the smoke, but not to extinguish the fire. A red hot t»r, covered with 
sawdust or green wood may be used. 

630. To Picile Salmon. 

Put a lane half pint of vinegar to a quart of liquor the fish has been boiled 
in, and halfan ounce of whole black pepper — boil it, and pour it cold over the 
fah, laid in a deep dish— a good wav to dress the saln^n after a dinner. Te 
boil a salmon on purpose to pickle, it keeps better for not being scaled. 
Pour a little sweet oil over the top of the pickle, and the salmon will keep 
food for months. 

631. To PieUe Shad. 

With a peck of rock salt and two quarts of blown, mix a pound of sugar 
and four ounces of saltpetre ; allow this preparation for every twenty-five 
shsd. Put a layer of this at the bottom of your barrel, then a layer of well- 
eleaned shad, with the skin down ; then another layer of salt, sugar, and 
saltpetre, and thus till you get in all the shad. Place a smooth fiat stone or 
some heavy weight on the shad, to keep them under brine. If in the course « 
•f a week the juice of the ahad do not make sufficient brine to cover them, 
add a little brine. 

633. To Cure Herring. 

Where the location will admit of it ; for family use, take your beef brine 
which is left of your winter*s stock, to the fishiiig place ; select the largest, 
and throw them in alive — (d\e brine they drink before they die, has a womler* 
fill effect in preserving their juices.) Let them remain twenty-four hcnus ; 
take them out, and lay them in a sloping position to drain, then pack them in 
a barrel till full, with coarse alum salt and saltpetre, in alternate layers of 
salt and fish, beginning with a laver of coarse alum salt, and taking care not 
to bruise the fish. Be liberal with your salt. In a few weeks, if they are not 
covered with brine, make some and add. Put a cover over them, and a weight 
to keep them under brine. When a year or two old, they are not inferior to 
anchovie^ 

633. An Excellent Common Pickle for Hams and Tongues- 

Allow for each gallon of water a pound and a half of salt, a pound of brown 
su^r or molasses, an ounce of saltpetre, and an ounce of allspice ; scald, 
skim, and cool it» Turn it on the meat, the meat first having been nibbed 
over with fine salt and lain two days. Let the meat remain in the pickle from 
two to four weeks, turning it daily. Canvas or coarse calico bags are good 
for keeping meat after it is smoked. Dip the bags several times in striHig 
brine, and dry them before putting it in, or put it in and then whitewash 
the bags. 

634. To Try Lard and Tallow. 

Lard tries easier the day the pork is butchered. It need not then be w^asb 
ed, except where stained. Cut it into pieces ; put it in an iron pot with a 
very little water to prevent bomin| ; boil it slowly over a moderate fire, stir- 
rinz it occasionally to prevent burning, till the scraps are quite brown ; strain 
it tnrough a coarse cloth, spread over a colander, into your lard tul>— what 
you want for your nicest without squeezing the strainer — then squeeae the 
scraps as dry as possible. Use the last strained first, as it will not keep so 
Ions as the first. Keep your lard coveted in a cool dry place. Some salt the 
Vara while trying, others do not. The latter keep« equally well widi the 
salted. The scraps are nice for eating. Tallow is tried in the same way. 
It should lie where perfectly cool and dry several days, and be stirred before 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 199 

trying. Some prefer having the lard lay a day or two before trying it. It 
should then be washed thoroughly in cold water. The laxvet make the 
nicest laid. 

635. To Manage Bees, 

The best mode known to the writer, is to make the bees a convenient snug 
little bed-room near your own. In the end of your dwelling-house, or in any 
of your out-buildings, make them a room with a number ofshelves, having a 
door for entry at pleasure ; place a hive on one of the shelves ; on the top of 
this hive, or at its side, place another, or a box, into which the bees can pass 
from the main hive, and which may be removed when full. They will sus- 
pend the comb to the shelves when all else is full. Make an opening through 
the outside of the building for the convenience of the bees gomg in and out. 
Among others, the writer would take the liberty of referring to a Mr. Bra- 
man, of Worcester, Mass. as having a good apiary of the kind described. See 
others also in Chester. In this way there is but little danger of a colony's 
being robbed on account of their weakness. As these little fellows are occa- 
sionally pugnacious, and seem impelled by a kind of simultaneous family 
impulse to make an assault upon their peaceable neighbors, the assailants 
may be identified at their own homes, by the sprinklmg a little flour over 
them while in the act of robbery and murder abroad. But it is beyond the 
art of man to mediate a truce. You must either ti^e up the hive attacked, 
or submit to its being plundered, &nd its inhabitants made prisoners of war. 
The chance for the assailants to fall, on the battle field, is small. 

636. To Make Cream. 

Mix two teaspoonfiils of flour, the well beaten yolks of two eggs, and a tea- 
spoonful of sugar, and turn on gradually a pint, of boiling milk, stirriQg con- 
stantly to prevent lumps. A very small bit of nice butti^r is sometimes added. 
Or, for coffee, beat the white of an e^ to a froth, adding a small bit of butter, 
and turn the coffee to it gradually, that it may not curole. Its taste is very 
similar to that of fresh cream. 

637. Yeasi of Cream of Tartar and Salaratus. 

Heat your oven ; mix two teaspoonfuls of-^ cream of tartar with one qiiait 
of flour, then dissolve one teaspoonful of salseratus in warm water, and mix 
it with the flour, adding water enough to make it soft dough. — ^As soon as 
thoroughly kneaded, place it in your oven until sufficiently baked, and the 
bread will be tender and of the nicest kind. Biscuit may be made in the 
same way by adding a little shortening. 

638. Tartaritc Acid Yeast. 

Tartaric acid may l)e used in all cases for cooking, where an acid is 
wanted. It imparts no other taste than that of pure acidity. In connection 
with salaeratus or soda, it makes a very quick and convenient yeast, for 
raising bread and biscuit of all kinds ; for crust ; and for griddle cakes. 
Use equal quantities of each. For dougkf put in a teaspoonful of salaeratus 
to a quart of flour. Then mould it up, putting in a teaspoonful of the acid. 
Let It stand fifVeen or twenty minutes, and bake. For griddle cakesj stir ia 
e(iual proportions of salaeratus and acid, putting in the acid last, andimme 
diately before cooking. 

639. Gardener Flour Pudding. 

Put a pint and a half of flour in a pan ; add four well beaten eges, a quart 
of milk, and two teaspoonfuls of salt. Beat all together till ^oroug^y 



20^ MISCELLANEOUS BBCEIPTS. 

mizetl ; b«g it and boil an hoar and a half. For sauce, take a teaciip of 
sugai half a gill of wine, and abuttemut-aise piece of butter, adding a kttia 
nuUneg. 

640. Whortleberry Pudding. 

Allow a quait of berries to sixteen spoonfuls of flour ; wash and spread 
the berries in a dish, gradually stir in half the flour, taking care nrit to mash 
the berries, break in two eegs, add a teaspoonful of salt, and the remainder 
of the flour, and milk enougn to make a batter as thick as for pancakes. Put 
it in a bag well floured into boiling water, and boil it an hour and a quarter. 

641. Custard Pudding, 

Take a quart of milk, eight eggs, and ei^teen spoonfuls of flour. Take 
enough of the milk to wet up smooth the flour; turn on the remainder grad- 
ually, stirring it constantly, and if boiling hot the better ; add the eggs well 
beaten when a little cool, and a little salt, and stir all well together. Btfke 
from twenty to thirty minutes. 

643. To Fricassee Eggs, 

Boil six em five minutes ; lay them in cold water, peel them carefully, 
dredge them Tightly with flour, beat one egg perfectly light, dip in the hanl 
eggs, roll them in bread crums, seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, 
covering them well, then letting them stand awjiile to dry ; fry them in boil- 
ing lard, and serve them up with any kind of rich well-seasoned gravy, and 
garnish with crisped parsley. 

643. Cold Sweet Sauce for Puddings. 

Rub equal Quantities of butter and suzar to a cream, add a little wine, 
form it into a lump, set it in a cool place for fifteen minutes, then grate nut 
meg over it. Qurrant jelly may be substituted for the wine 

644. Buckwheat Cakes, 

Turn on to three cups of flour and a teaspoonful of salt, enough hot water 
to make a thin batter. When lukewarm, add a spoonful of yeast, and set it 
in a warm place to rise. In the morning add a teaspoonful of salaeratus in a 
teacup of hot water. If mixed in the evening, and it rise too fast, set the 
batter in a cool place through the night Some of the same batter may be 
reserved for the next time. 

645. Cheap Mountam Pound Cake, 

To one egg and four ounces of butter, well beaten togetherj add a tea- 
spoonful of allspice; half a teaspoonful of pepper; pint of molasses ; tea- 
spoonful of salaeratus, dissolved in a teacup of creani^ or milk ; and flour 
enoijjzh to make the consistency of fritters ; set it where quite warm to rise , 
and when perfectly light, Jl}ake moderately. 

646. Noodles for Soup. 

Thicken two eggs with flour, addins a little salt, till stiff enough to roll 
out like pie crust ; sift flour over it ; do up the sheet in folds, sifting flour 
over each ; then shave it into very ftne strings, and boil them in your soup 
fifteen minutes. 

647. To Clarify Sugar. 

Put to three pounds of sugar a pint of water; add the white of one egg 
well beaten and mixed with half a pint of water. Boil all till the scum rises, 
4et it off the fire till it falls, then skioi it.

648. To make Wheat Starch. 

Wash a peck of good pure wheat ; cover it with water in a tub plar«a ib 
he son : change the water daily to prevent its unpleasant smell ; whim the 
wheat becomes very soft, rub it out in water, throw the husks into another 
tub, let the white substance settle, turn off the water, put on fresh, stir it 
well, and let it settle ; do this dail^', till the water turns off perfectly clear. 
Put the starch in a bag, and set it in the sun a few days ; then take it out, 
and dry it on platters. 

649. To make Potato Starch. 

Wash perfectly clean half a bushel of nice potatoes, grate them, wash the 
pulp thoroughly, rinsing and straining it througn a sieve ; stir it well, and turn 
off the water after the starch has settled Add new water ; next day stir 
well, let settle, and turn off the water again, and thus till the water turns off 
clear, adding a little bluing to the last. Collect and diy -the starch. 

650. To prepare Starch for Use* 

Wet your starch gradually with cold water till it will readily pour, rubbing 
it perfectly smooth with a spoon ; stir it into boiling water, and let it boil five 
or six minutes, frec^uently stirring it ; stir in a little spermaceti, or stir it 
with a caudle ; strain and use it. 

Poland starch is made in the same manner. Muslins, to look clear and 
nice, should be clapped dry while the starching is hot, then folded in a venr 
damp cloth till quite damp before ironing. Isinglass is a very delicate starch 
for fine muslins ; also rice. Some add a veiy little fine salt to starch. 

651. White Apple Sauce. See Nos. 508 and 515. 

Pare and quarter tart apples ; put to them enough water to prevent their 
burning, and boil till perfectly tender. Sweeten with sugar, ana season with 
grated lemon, mace, or nutmeg. 

652. Opodeldoc. 
Put into a pint of the spirits of wine, two ounces of camphor and a cake of 
Windsor soap sliced fine ; put all in a quart cup, cover close and set it in 
boiling water, and let it remain till they are dissolved. Add two ounces of 
the oil of origanum, and, when milk warm, a little salt. 

653. Ox Marrow Pomade. See Nos. 722, 853. 
Simmer 10 ozt. ox-marrow. Strain it on 10 ozs. castor oil. Beat together 
till white as cream ; if for hours the better. Add ounce and half essential 
oils for perfume. Brandy and castor oil also good for the hair. 

654. To Preserve Herjts. 

Gather them on a dry day, just before blossoming ; suspend them, tied in 
bunches, in a dry airy place, with the blossom end downwards ; wrap the 
medicinal ones, when perfectly dry, in paper, and keep them from the air. 
Pound fine and sift the leaves of such as are to be used in cooking, and keep 
the powder in corked bottles. 

655. To preserve Vegetables through the Winter. 

Keep succulent vefretables in a damp, shady, cool place. Protect pota* 
toes, turnips, and similar vegetables from the air and fro«t, by burying them 
in sand. Potatoes will not sprout, it is said, if covered with charcoal dust. 
It is also said that sweet potatoes will keep months thus, — ^packed in boxei 
of dry sand, exposed to the influences of smoke.

o5G. Superior Writing Ink. 

Mix with a gallon of pure soft water, and stir in well, twelve oancct 
of ctmrsely-powdered Aleppo galls, six of chipped logwood, five of protoatti* 
phate of i^-on, five of ^um-arabic, and two of dry MuscovtuJo sugar. 

657. Indelible Ink for Marking. 

DtKRolve two drachms of lunar-caustic and half an ounce of gum-arabic in 
a gill of rainwater ; dip the part to lie marked in strong saleratus water ; ir(*n 
it quite smooth when dry ; mark and place it in the sun or near the fire to dry. 
Make marking red ink by reducing to a fine powder half an ounce of vermil- 
ion and 9. drachm of the salt of steel, and mixing them with enough linseed 
oil to make the red ink of the same consistency as the black. 

658. Black BaU, 
Melt together, slowly, ten ounces of bayberry tallow, five of beeswax, and 
one of mutton tallow. After melted, add enough ivoiy or lamp-black to give 
it when polished, a good black gloss. Stir all well toge^r, and on taking it 
from the fire, add a glass of spirit.

Mix and stir well together four ounces of ivory-black, six gills of vinegar, 
two spoonfuls of molasses, and one o^ sweet oil. 

660. PiUs.^ Worms. (Fbr OHIdren.) 

For the Pileg, roast, pulverize, and mix the wU of an old shoe with lard or 
ox marrow, and apply it. For Worms, brown, pulverize, and mix egg-shells 
with molasses. Give teaspoonful night and morning. 

661. Cement for Corked Bottles, 

Melt with four ounces of sealing-wax, four of rosin and two of bef^s* wax- 
Stir it with a tallow candle when it froths, and as soon as it melts, dip into it 
the mouths of the corked bottles — it will make them air ti^ht. Some use two 
ounces of shellac, four of Spanish brown, and four of rosin. 

662. Cement for Broken Glass, China, or Earthenware. 

Rub the edges of the broken vessel with the beaten white of an egg ; tie 
finely powdered quicklime in a muslin bag, and sift it thick over the egg ; 
match and bind the pieces together, and let them remain bound several weeks. 
This is a cement for all kinds of crockery but thick heavy glass-ware, or coarse 
earthen. The former cannot be cemented — ^for the latter use white paint. 
Paint the broken edges, match and bind them tight together, letting them 
remain till the paint is dry and hard. Milk is a good cement. Match the 
pieces, bind them tight together, put the ware in cold milk, boil the milk half 
an hour, take it from the fire and let the crockery remain till the milk is cold. 
Keep the crockery bound several weeks. The Chinese mode of mending 
broken china is to grind flint glass on a painter's stone, till it becomes an im- 

Italpable powder, and then to beat it with the white of an egg to a froth, and 
ay it on the broken ed^es, and match and bind them, and let them remain 
some weeks. It is said to be impossible to break the ware where thus 
cemented. 



663. Japanese Cement, or Rice Glue. 

Boil gently rice flour mixed to a smooth paste, with cold water. It is far 
more transparent and smooth than wheat flour paste, and answers the same

for basts, models, basso-relievos, and like articles. They are susceptible of 
a high polish made of it. Poland starch ia a fine cement for pasting liqren 
of paper or fancy articles. 

664. Alabaster Cement, 

Helt a pound of white bees' wax and a pound of rosin, and strew over it 
gently three quarters of finely pulverized alabaster. Stir all well together, 
and knead it m water, to thoroughly incorporate! the mass. The alabastei, 
when mended,«hQuld be heated ; heat the cement also on applying it. Join, 
bind together, and let it remain a weelu It is a very strong cement. 

665. Iron^ware Cement; and To mend cracks in Stoves and Pipes. 

.: Sxix Into th^ whitQ of eggs be»tQl2 to'a fixtth, enough powdered quick lime 
to make a consistent paste, and then stir in iron file dust to make a thick 
paste. Fill the cracks of iron-waire with this cement, and do not use it for 
some weeks. Mend cracks in stoves and pipes, by. applying a paste of wood- 
ashes, salt, and water. 

6G6. To renew Stale Bread and CcfJce. 

Fill a bread steamer about half full of water, and lay the old bread on it, 
and put it on the fire, where it will steam the bread thirty or forty minutes ; 
then wrap the bread in a towel, and let it remain till dry. Old dry bread may 
thus be made moist and good. As a substitute for a steamer, soak the bread 
m cold water till it has absorbed enough water to be moist throughout ; then 
put it in a bake^pan without any cover, and make it v^ry hot. If broken 
pieces of bread are put in the oven for several hours after baking, and rusked, 
they will keep gooa a long time. Heavy sour bread, in this way, may be 
made into tolerably good cakesand puddm^, if enough, salseratus be used to 
oorrectthe acidity. Ri^h cake, that has wrtie dr brancfy, will keep good sev- 
eral months in cold weather, if kept cool and dry. When it is to be. eaten, 
not. it in a cake pan and set it in a bake pan ^at has half a pint of wat«r in 
It; put on the bake pan cover, and let the csdLe bake till heated very hot. 
Let it get cold before cutting. 

667. To Pot Cheese* 

Cheese that has begun to mould, may be kept from becoming more so, if 
treated thus : — cut off the mouldy part, then grate it, if the cheese be dry. If 
not, pound it fine in a mortar, crust and all. To each pound, when fine, put 
a spoonful of brandy, mix it well with tbs cheese^ press it tight in a clean 
stone- pot, and lay a paper wet in brandy on the top. .Cover the pot tight, 
«iui keep it in a cool ary place. Diy pieces of cheese may be potted in the 
Mme manner. Potted eheese is best a year old. It will keep several years 
without breeding insects. 

668. To preserve Cheese from Insects, 

Cover the cheese, while whole, with a fiour paste ; wrap a.cloth round it, 
and covtfr that with. paste ; keep the cheese in a cool d^ place. Cheese 
with insects, if kept till cold weather, will be free of them. 

669. To freshen Salt Butter* 
If butter is too salt, allow to each pound of it a (^uart of new milk ; chum 
*jL an hour, and then work it like new butter ; working in a little white sugar 
improves it. It is said to be as good as new butter. A bit of now salt buttet 
may be quite freshened, l)v working it in cold water, and repeatedly changing 
the water.

Take m little for immediate xue, allowing two teaspoonfiih of aahsratos 
diaaolved in a aaart of boiling water for a pound of batter ; pot in the butter, 
mix it well with the aalBratua water, let it be till cold, then take it off care- 
iiiUy, and work a teaspoonful of salt into it. Thus managed it does reiy well 
for cooking. 

071. To pot Butter far Winter. 

Into six pounds of new-made batter, work the miztnre of a spoonful of 
powdercNl white sugar, one of salt, and one of saltpetre. When yoo have 
finished patting down your butter, in a stone pot, cover it with fine salt, pot 
in Inmate layers of sah with the batter; cover so close as to ezdnde the 
air. Some prefer potting batter in brine : — make the brine of the saltness 
wished for tne batter, add half a spoonful of saltpetre to two gallons of brine, 
made bjr taming boiUag water on the salt. Put it to the butter when cold, 
and let it cover the butter. Another method — free the butter entirely of the 
buttermilk ; woik it up quickly with about half an ounce of salt to the pound ; 
let it lay one day or longer ; beat well together four ounces of salt, two of loaf 
sugar, and a quarter of an ounce of saltpetre, and work the mixture thoroughly 
into the batter, allowing half an ounce for every pound. Pack it in iars or 
tube, and place a layer of the mixture in f<dds (u thin muslin, Etching it 
loosely and placing it neatly over the top.

673. To keep Eggs tiU 17 th of June^ or for Christmas. 

Buy c^ for family use when cheapest ; pat them into two gallons o£ 
water, mixed with half a pint of salt and half a pintof onslacked lime, flfake 
the pickle with boiling water. Put it cokl to the eggs. Let the eggs be new 
laid, and perfect; quite covered with the lime water, and kept in a stone pot 
in a cool place. Thus preserved, eggs will keep good six months. If occa- 
sionally turned over, the better. 

674. To prepare Fat for Shortening. 

Except ham and mutton, aU kinds of meat make good shortening. Scnme 
from the cold congealed drippings of roast meat, or tiie fat of boiled meat, the 
adhesive sediment ; slice the fat, adding any acrun oi fat fipom broiled meat 
you may have ; melt it slowly, and strain it. When congealed into a haid 
cake, scr^ie off the sediment if any adhere, melt it again, and when paiUy 
cool, add a teaspoonful of salt to a pound of shortening. Use the dim for 
soap-grease. Except in the hottest weather, shortening thus prepared is a 
good substitute for lard. The fat of cooked meats should not be kept more 
than three days in summer, and seven in winter, without bein^; tried. Ham 
fat, if boiled in fresh water and clarified, does very well to fry m. And mut- 
ton-fat, melted into a tallow cake, wiU please the tallow-chandler. 

675. Directions for Washing White Cotton Goods. 

Turn boiling water on table cloths, and all white clothes stained by C(^ee 
or fruit, before putting them in soap suds, and let them lay till the water is 
cold, then rubbmg out the stains. The stains will be irremovably set, if put 
into soap suos. Table cloths will be less liable to stain if always rinsed in 
thin itarch water, as that prevents the penetrating of stains. Put very dixtf 






MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 205 

white clothes in strong cool suds on the fire over night, and they will easily 
clean. If they get to boiling, do not care. It will not hurt them if the sads 
be cool on putting them in — if hot then, it will set the dirt. The following 
saves lalx>r : — Soak clothes in lukewarm soap suds, if very dirty, over night; 
put a spoonful of salts of soda, and a pint of soft soap, to every three pails of 
water ; make it moderately warm ; put in the clothes without rubbing, and 
boil them an hour. 

676. To Wash Calicoes, 

Before putting the clothes in water, rub out the grease spots ; they cannot 
be seen after all is wet. Wash them in mildly warm soap suds, which will 
clean them as well as hot suds, with less injury to the colors. Use soft soap 
for yellow shades, but for no other ; and do not rinse in fair water. Rinse 
other colors in fair water, and dry them in the shade. If calicoes incline to 
fade, set the colors by washing them in lukewarm water, with beef's gall, 
allowing a teacup for every four or five gallons of water. No soap is required, 
unless the clothes are very dirty. Then wash them in tepid suds, after 
being rubbed out in beef's gall water. Rinse them in fair water. Beef's 
gall can be kept several months, by bottling it tight, and putting in a little 
salt. Wash black calicoes in water that potatoes have been boiled in. Such 
water may be saved through the whole week, or potatoes may be sliced and 
boiled, for the sake of the water. For mourning calico, the best way is to 
boil the clothes in strong hard soap suds about ten minutes, turning and 
pressing them in the suds, and then to rinse them in strong bluins water. — 
The following mode is said to set colors, so they will not fade by after wash* 
uxg :— add Uiree gills of salt to four quarts of boUing water ; put in the calieoes 
perfectly clean, and let them remain till the water is cold. A little atum in 
the rinsing water is good for green and yellow ; or a little vinegar for green, 
pink, and red. All calicoes but black, look better for starching. They will 
not look clear. Potato water, boiled to a thick consistence, stiflfens them 
without showing. 

677. To Wash Woolens. 

If you wish to thicken your fiannels by shrinking them, wash them in soil 
soap suds, and rinse them in cold water. To prevent white fiannels shrink- 
ing, wash them in hard soap suds, without rubbing any soap on them ; rub 
them out in another suds, wring them out, put them in a clean tub, pour on 
boiling water to cover them, and let them remain till the water is cold. A 
little indigo in the boiling water improves the looks of the flannels. Gok>red 
woolens mat incline to fade, wash with beef's gall and warm water, before 
putting them in soap suds. Colored pantaloons look well washed with beef's 
gall and fair warm water, and pressed on the wrong side while damp. 

678. To remove Irik, Fruit Stains, and Iron Mould, 

Moisten the soiled part with cold water, then place it over the smoke of 
burning brimstone. Or wet the spots in milk, and cover them with salt, before 
washing the garments. Or dip ink stains in hot tallow. 

679. To remove Stains from Broadcloth. 

Take an ounce of fine ground pipe clay, mix it with twelve drsps of alco- 
hol, and twelve of the spirits of turpentine ; moisten a little of this mixture 
with alcohol, whenever you wish to remove any stains, and rub it on them. 
Let it remain till dry, then rub it off with a woolen cloth.

not touch the unsoiled part) — rinse tne stains in fair water unm^iiately. 
Weak sdsBratus water will remove stains caused by acids. 

683. To extract Stains from Cohred Silks and White Cotton 

Goods. 

Salts of ammonia, mixed with lime, will remore wine stains frmn silk; 
ewar ammonia, alcohol, and spirits of turpentine, will all remove stains from 
eolcwed silks. Durable or common ink spots may be removed, by saturating 
them with lemon juice, rubbing in salt, and then placine them where the sun 
will shine on them hot for some hours. Put on more lemon juice and salt, 
as fast as it dries. Nitric acid is a good substitute, when lemon acid cannot 
be had. Remove iron mould in the same way. Mildew and most other 
stains can be removed by rubbing on soft soap and salt, and placing the stain 
where the sun will shipe on it, hot. Use the remedies in warm, clear wea- 
ther, when the sun is hot. Sulphuric acid, diluted with wsiXei, is effectual 
in removing fruit stains. Do not have it so strong as to eat holes ; rinse in 
Mdnratus, then in fair water. Soak colored cotton ink stained goods in tepid 
sour milk. 

683. To extract Grease from Floors^ Silks^ Woolen Goods and 

Paper. 

Rub fikx>r grease spots with strongsaleratus water mixed with sand. And 
on those of goods and paper, grate French chalk very thick ; f common chalk 
is not so goody--cover the chalk with soft brown paper, ana place on it a 
moderately hot iron, not scorching hot, and let it remain till cooL If the 
grease is not entirely removed, repeat the application of the brown paper and 
a heated iron, until it is. 

684. To cleanse SUk Goods. 

Rub on silk cushions, or silk coverings to furniture, diy bran, with a woolen 
cloth, till clean. Remove grease spots and stains as by preceding receipts. 
JBxtract the spots of silk garments before washing. Use hard soap for all 
colors but yellow ; for yellow, soft soap is best. Beat the soap in hot watei 
till perfectly dissolved, then add just enough cold water to make it tepid ; rub 
the silks in it till clean ; take them out without wringing, and rinse them in 
fair tepid water. Rinse them in another water — ^and for crimsons, bright 
yellows, and maroons, add enough sulphuric acid to the water to give it an 
acid taste. To restore the colors of the different shades of pink, put a little 
vinegar or lemon juice in the second rinsing water. For scarlet, use a solu- 
tion of tin ; for purples, blues, and other shades, use salaeratus ; and for olive- 
greens, dissolve verdigris in the rinsing water. Rinse fawn and browns in 
pure water ; dip the silks up and down in the rinsing water ; take them out 
without wringing, and dry them in the shade ; fold them while damp ; let 
them remain for the dampness to strike through all parts of them alike, and 
then put them in a mangier. If you have none, iron them on the wrong side 
with an iron only hot enough to smooth them. A little isinglass, or gum- 
arabic, dissolved in the rinsing water of gauze, shawls, and ribbons, is good 
to stiffen them. The water in which pared potatoes have been boiled, is an 
excellent thing to wash black silks in. It stiffens and makes them of a gloss]^

water, but they should be washed in two different waters. 

685. To clean Silk and Woolen SKawh. 

Pare and grate mealy potatoes, and put to a pint of the pulp two quarts of 
M>id water. On standing five hours, strain it through a sieve, rubbing a^i 
nuch of the potato through as possible. Let the strained water stand to 
settle ; when perfectly clear, turn the water off carefully from the dregs ; 
spread a clean white cotton sheet on a clean table, lay on the shawl to be 
cleaned, and pin it tight. Dip a sponge that has never been used, in the 
potato water, and rub the shawl with it till clean ; rinse the shawl in clean 
water, with a teacup of salt to a pailful of water ; spread it on a clean level 
place, where it will dry very quick. If suspended to dry, the colors are apt 
to run and make the shawl streaked. Fold it up while damp, let it lay half 
an hour, and put it in a mangier^ or wrap it in a clean white cloth, and put 
it under a weight, and let it remam till dry.' Grease spots, if any, should be 
extracted before washing the shawl. 

686. Carpets. 

Take up and shake carpets that are in constant iise, three or four times a 
year. The dirt underneath wears them out very fast. Straw spread under 
neath prevents their wear. To prevent moths, take up your carpets once a 
year, if but little used. Sprinkle black pepper, or tobacco under your car- 
pets to protect them from moths. When freed of dust, remove the grease 
spots ; if soiled so as to need cleaning all over, spread them on a clean floor, 
and rub pared and grated raw potatoes on them with a new broom. Let 
them lay till perfectly dry, before walking on them. Some use beef's gall 
for cleaning carpets. Wash straw carpets in salt and water, and wipe them 
with a dean dry cloth. Some say, scoar them with sand and water and a 
little hard soap. 

687. To renovate Rusty Italian Crape. 

Dissolve in half a pint of skim milk and water an inch square of glue ; 
take it from the fire, nnse the crape in vinegar to clean it, then to stiffen it, 

gut it in the glue mixture, wring it, clap it dry, and smooth it with a hot iron, 
rst layinff a paper over it. Saturate rusty crape by dipping it in gin ; clap 
it dry, and smooth it with a moderately hot iron. Italian crape can be dyed 
so as !o look as nice as new. 

688. To dean Light Kid Gloves. 

Rub them smartly with India rubber, magnesia, or moist bread. If soiled 
beyond thus restoring, sew up the tops and rub them with a decoction of saf- 
fron and water, using a sponge. They will be yellow or brown, according 
to the strength of the decoction. 

Put on kid Gloves. Rub them with spirits of hartshorn ; or with flannel,

minutes over a slow fire, carefully stirring it. When quite hot, lay it on the 
marble with a brush, and let it remain half an hour ; wash it off with warm 
water, flannel, and a scrubbing brush, and wipe it diy. Some clean alabas- 
ter and all kinds of marble, by mixing pulverized pumice stone with verjuice, 
letting it remain several hoiun ; then dipping in a perfectly clean sponge, and 
rubbing the marble till clean. Rinse it off with fair water, and rub it dry 
with a clean linen cloth. ^ 

690. To clean Knives and Forks, 

Use finely i>owdered Bath brick to remove rust, and to polish steel uten 
sils. Rub knives on a board with a thick leather cover over it fastened down 
tight, applying a cork dipped in the powder, and moistened if they are spotted. 
£k> not wet them, only wipe them with a dry cloth. Wipe the handles with 
a cloth rather damp, to make them smooth ; do not touch the blades, as it will 
tarnish them. It will yellow ivoiy handles to dip them in hot water. If 
yellow rub them with sand paper. If Bath brick does not remove rust from 
steel, rub the spots with sand paper or emery, or rub on sweet oil and let it 
remain a day, and then rub it off with quicklime. Clean thoroughly steel 
utensils that are not in constant use ; rub them over with sweet oil, and 
exclude the air by a wrapper of brown paper — wrapping each knife and fork

a dry place. Polish silver with whiting or chalk pulverized. If spotted, rub 
the chalk wet on the silver, and let it remain till dry ; then rub it off and 
polish with a clean dry cloth. Hot ashes will remove spots which chalk will 
not. Rub Britannia^ if sj)otted, with a flannel cloth dipped in sweet or lin- 
seed oil, and then wash it in soap suds and wipe dry. Polish by rubbing 
over, with a clean dry cloth, whiting, or chalk. 

692. Cautions relative to Brass, Copper, and Glazed Earthen 

Utensils, 

Many lives have been lost in consequence of carelessness in the use of 
these utensils. Thoroughly cleanse with salt and hot vinegar, brass and 
copper, before cooking in them ; and never suffer any oily or acid substance, 
after cooked, to cool or remain in any of them. 

693. To clean Stoves and Stone Hearths. 

Put on varnished stoves several coats of varnish in the summer, to have it 
set hard before used. Wash them in warm water without soap, and rub a

liid>le to crack,) covering it with cold water, and then heating it gradually. 
Let it remain in till the water has cooled. 

697. To temper New Ovens and Iron-ware. 

Before a new oven is baked in, keep up a fire in it half a day. Put up the 
lid as soon as the wood is removed. Do not use it for bakine till it has been 
heated the second time. It will never retain its heat well, unless lem- 
pered in this way. Heat new flat*ixons half a day also, before using them, 
to have them retain their heat well; New iron cooking utensils will oe less 
liaUe to crack, if heated gradually five or six hours, and then cooled slowlv 
before being used. Do not turn cold water into hot iron utensils, as it wiU 
crack them by cooling the surface too suddenly. 

698. To loosen tightfy wedged Stopples of Decanters and Smelling 

Bottles. 

Rub a feather dipped in oil round the stopple, close to the mouth of the

Honey that is not fit for the table, makes good metheglin. The older the 
honey, the greater its strength. Break and rub with the hands all the comb 
that has any honey in it, into a tub of water, moderately 'warm ; strain it 
through a hair sieve into another tub ; put into the liquor a perfect, new laid 
egg» to tnr its strength ; repeat the rinsing, squeezing, and draining of the 
comb, till all the sweets have passed through the sieve, leaving part of the 
egg floating above the surface of the liquor, as big as a twelve and a half 
cent piece ; and then boil it one hour in a brass kettle, skimming it well jast 
before it be^ns to boil, and occasionally, during the time of its boiling. Do 
not let it bou over. Should it be about to go over, lay the tongs, with me legs 
extended, across the kettle. Dip it, boiling hot, inUi Knew white oak cask;

the bottom, and laying near the top part of the boara ; with a rollmg-pin,

the bac. Now skim all the wax from the water in the tub ; melt it, (putting

which adheres to the bottom. This may again be melted and shaped.

W^^^^^^^^^^^^^^k^^^^^^^0^^^^^^^^^^ 



Thi Impbotvd H0V8BWIFI is jiut such & work as a good, inteUigeiit 
American wife and mother, after thirty years* experience in the great and 
comprehensive art of housekeeping and nursing, wouM give her daughteis, 
as the concentrated and available experience of her life, in the duties upon 
which they are about to engage. It will be a pleasing and intelligent and 
profitable companion, and relieve the anxieties of husbands and wives. — 
aangor Whig ^ Qomier, A very useful book. — Mom. News, St Johns, N. B. 



The great fault with most cook-books is, that they contemplate too high 
living, so that a frugal housewife cannot use them. This defect is obviated 
in the present werk. It is a guide to economy, as well as to comfort, show- 
ing how to provide excellent dishes from very plain materials ] and is not 
made up of extracts, but is the result of more than thirty-four years' expe- 
rience OB the part of the author. — Boston Recorder. 



We have examined the work, and we consider it far superior to any yet 
published, besides being cheaper. Our New-England and Southern ex- 
changes all speak of it as being the best ever published. No housekeeper 
should be without it Sold by the agent only, now in the city. — Deirmt Free 
Press. Should be made a test book for every female seminary. — Brooklyn Ad. 

It is the most thorough — the most clear book of its kind extant. — Stdem 
Advertiser and Argus. 



As a Book of Recipes, we believe " The Improved Housemfe" to be the 
best that can be obtainefl. It contains aim some excellent hints. There is 
no reason and no excuse for not having our food properly prepared. There 
is no merit in caring nothine for what we eat. Our food should be prepared 
with reference to our health ; and this requires that our meats should be 
rightly cooked, and our bread rightly made. It is neither economical nor 
healthful to turn off a family with food which is left to cook itself. But 
there are a class of young housekeepers who seem to take some pride in 
their ignorance of this one great duty of a housekeeper. They are so trained 
by their mothers, and finally inflicted on some unfortunate man, whose only 
resource is to bear it the best way he can. To att such, we recommend 
this book as a partial relief. Others, who understand 8omethin| about the du- 
ties of a house&eeper, will find it an important aid. — Mother's M<u:., N. York. 
Most valuable text book ; receipts the best ev«r presented. — N. OrL Courier, 



Without being well cooked, the best viotuals are supplied in vain. It is, 
therefore, essential that every mistress of a fanuly should be qualified to 
direct her servants in this important particular. An excellent work — con- 
tains ample instrdctions ; no housekeeper should be without it.'-^Baltunort 
Clipper.

Appended to the last editioja is a " PERPETUAL CALENDAR," 
which is worth the cost of the work itself —Clev^and Plamdeoler. 



RECOMMENDATIONS. 233 

J%t Improved Hmuemfe contains a great rariety of valuable receipts fof 
cooking, and for general and domestic economy. We do not know of n 
work so well adapted to its objects, and so fit to be placed in the hands of a 
young housekeeper. It is also on a scale to suit those whose necessities 
demand plain-living and frugal housewifery. We can recommend it with 
greia heartiness. — Kiehnumd Christian Advocate, 



It is a very valuable and useful book. — Riekmond RepuUican, 



It professes to give what is much needed in the domestic circle, an 
economical plan of preparing food for the table. And, from a hasty glance at 
its pages, as well as from a number of judicious notices we have seen in 
reference to it, we have no doubt it will accomplish all its purposes. The 
volume also contains engravings for marketing and carving, two most indis- 
pensable accompaniments to good cooking ; also a variety of new receipts 
on various other subjects. — Christian Repository, Philadelphia, 



Next to having any thing good to eat, the most important consideration is 
to have it well cooked ana served up. In our mode of cooking we are 
lamentably at fault. This deficiency can well be supplied by the study of 
The Improved Housewife. It is a compend of all kinds of receipts, direc- 
tions for carving, extracting grease-spots, stains, &c. It contains a sum 
mary of all the duties of an accomplished housekeeper ; and, if practiced, 
it will make perfect. — Macon Messenger, Geo, 



The Improved Housewife presents a variety of useful novelties, rendering 
It superior, in several respects, to the ordinary cook-books. In those cases 
where it treats of the matters usually found in such works, it appears to be 
judicious and economical, giving the actual results of the expenence of the 
author. It has a series of drawing, showing how to purchase meats ; a 
convenient table of umghts reduced to their equivalent measures, obviating 
he necessity of scales ; drawings illustrative of carving ; directions for 
serving a dinner with propriety ; and, what is of great importance, recipes 
in cookery for the sick.'^Portland Advertiser, 



This work should be found in every household. It is just such a one as 
the thrifty houseutfe would require. — Charleston Southern PairioL 



Its pages possess a fund of information which cannot fail to be useful to 
those who study comfort and ec<ftiomy. — Democratic Unions Harrisburg. 



If this book had been studied when many of us went to school, our bread 
would have been better made. Hints how to procure the best pieces at 
market, and, after they are well cooked, how to carve them, will be found 
useful. No family library should be without it. — The Georgian, Savannah. 



We cannot be far out of the way in saying, with every body who speaks 
of it, that ** The Imprerved Housewife " is a capital book of its kind We

PREFACE. 



Thb obvious want of a suitable text-book for the 
Culinary Department, has induced the writer to prepare 
this work, being mostly the result of personal experi- 
ence as house-keeper^ for the last thirty -four years. 

*' Most of the receipts now in use, are the result of 
chance, or the whim of a depraved appetite." Their 
insufficiency is well known, and it has long been the 
subject of complaint. 

Many new receipts, it is believed, are now for the 
first time, presented to the public. Selections have also 
been made from other compilations — such as have been 
proved to be good, by actual trial. 

While this book is intended for all classes of society, 
embracing receipts both for rich and for plain cooking, 
it is especially intended as a guide to those who would 
cooik well, and please the palate at small expense — con- 
siderations of no small importeince at all times. 

In conclusion, — the writer would humbly hope that 
her experience may lighten the cares, dissipate the per- 
plexities, an4 guide the judgment of all who fill the 
station, or assume the duties of Cook, or of Old or 
" Young House-keeper."

PARTICULARS TO BE 0B8ERTCD IN THE SELECTION Ot M ARKETABLSS. 

Beef. 

The fat should look white rather than yellow. Ox beef 
is the richest. If young, the flesh will have a :fine, smooth, 
open grain, be of a good red, and the flesh tender. In 
small families fine-fed heifer beef is preferred by some. 



Veal 



Choose the meat of which tftb kidney is covered with 
white, thick) ^^m fat. * 

"IP Mutton. 
Judge by fineness of grain, and firmness of white fat. 



MMvamna ri*«rat. IT 



If the vein in the neck of the fore quarter is Mmuh, it b 
fresh. 

Pork. 

If young, on pinching the lean it will break ; if fresh, it 
will be smooth and cool. Thin rind is a merit in all pork. 

^ Turkey. 

If yoimg» it has a smooth, black leg. If fresh, eyes full 
and bright, and feet supple and moist. 

Fofds. 

If young, their comb and legs will be smooth. If fresh, 
llie yent will be close and dark. 

Geese. 

Young ones will have yellow bills and feet, and a pin 
head may be easily forced through the skin of the breast. 
If fresh, the feet will be pliable. 

Ducks. 

Select such as have supple feet, and are hard and thick 
on the breast and belly. 

Shad. 
If good, they are white and thick. 

Herring. 
Gills should be of a fine red ; eyes bright. 

Lobsters, 

The male, though generally sm|^er, has the highest fla* 
vor ; the flesh is firmer, and the color, when boiled, is a 
deeper red. Known by the narrow back part of the tail.

MARltSTINO PLATES. 



and its two ui^ermost fins, which are stiff and hard. If 
fresh, the claws wiU hare a strong motion on pressing the 
eyes with the fingers. 

Crabs, 

When in perfection, the joints of the legs are stiff, and 
the body has % very agreeable smell. The heaviest are 
the best ; though some prefer the middling sized as the 
sweetest. 



*o * 



CARVING. 



Sleioht, rather than muscular strengtli, is the secret of 
the art. To carve with ease, and wilh dispatch, requires 
practice. The observing of others, and attentioa to the 
following plates, will soon enable the practitioner to become 
an adept. The carver should be seated sufficiently ele- 
vated; so neu the dish aa not to require effijrt in reaching; 
and should wield, with the greatest facili^, a keen blade. 

As a jH'eliminaiy, see the butcher has made the cleaver 
do its duty faithfully. 

Fish wants but little carving. The pieces should be 
[H'SBeived as whole as possible. A fish trowel will be 
found preferable to a knife. 

1. Cod's Head and Shoulders. 

a iH Introduce the trowel at 

a, and cut through the 
back aa far as b, then help 
to pieces from between i; 
and d, and with each piece 
help a portion of the sound, 
which lines the under par 
of the back bone. It is 

esteemed a delicacy ; is thin, and of a darker color 4han 

the rest of the fish. 

Some persons are fond of the palate and tongue, for 

which you must put a spoon into the mouth. About the 

jaw-bone Ues the jelly part, and within the head the finnn 

parts. 




r Aiteh Bone of Beef. 

Gut off and lay hj 
a thick slice icom tho 
, entire surface, aamark- 
sd a, b, then help. 
There are two kinds 
t of fat attached to this 
joint. Know which is 
prefened, as tastes 
The solid lies at c, and must be cut horizontally ; 
that resembling marrow, or the sofWr, lies at the back of 
the bone, below d. 

A silver skewer should be used, for the one which keeps 
the meat together while boihng; and may be removed when 
you cut to it. 

3. Sirloin of Beef. 

There are two ways 
of carving this joint. 
The better is, by long 
thin pieces foun aloe; 
the other way is, which 
spoils it, to cut across. 
The most tender and 
I best part lies ia the dr- 

reclion of the line b. ; there, too, lies some delicate fat. 
Part should be given with each slice. 
4. Ribs of Berf. 
These may be ehced like the sirloin, commencing at the 
thin end and slicing the whole length, so as to give s mix- 
ture of fat and lean. 

5. Round of Beef. 
Remove the upper surface, as in the edge bone ; he^ to 
thin slices, with a portion of fat ; cutting as even as possi- 
ble, to pioserve its beauty of appearance. 
6. Tongue. 
Cut peipendicular thin slices, commencing a little nearer 
d)« root ttum the tip. The fat lies underside, at the root. 



CARTZiril. 



SI 




7. Calfs Head. 

Cut thin slices from 
a to h, to the bone. 
The throat sweetbread 
lies at c. Slice from e 
to d, and help that with 
the other part. Should 
the eye be requested: 
extract with the point 
of the knife, and help to a portion. The palate, a delicate 
morsel, lies under the head. The sweet tooth, too, not an 
inferior delicacy, lies back of all the rest, and, in a young 
calf, is easily extracted with the knife. On removing the 
jaw bone, fine lean will appear. Help to each of these. 

8. Shatilder of Mutton. 

Slice to the bone at 
the line a, and help 
thin pieces from each 
side. The choice fet 
lies at the outer edge, 
at b. Should more be 
needed than can be 
gotten from those 
parts, slice on either 
side of the line e, which represents the blade bone ; and 
nice pieces may be obtained. From the under side, also, 
by slicing horizontally. 

9. Leg of Mutton, 

The nicest p^ 
lies at a, midway be- 
tween the knuckle 
and the other end. 
Thence, cut thin 
slices each way, as 
deep as h. The out* 
side being seldom 
very fat^ some favorite pieces may be sliced off the broad 





S2 



<uRvm«. 




end at e. The kaucUe is tender ; but the other part mcnre 
juicy. Some good ibices may be cut lengthwise, from the 
broad end of the back of the leg. • The cramp bone is much 
thought of by some : to get it, cut down to the bone at d^ 
and in the curre line to «. - 

10. S^re Rib, 

Carve, first, slices from 
the fleshy part, tracing the 
line a, b. This will give a 
proportion of lean and fat ; 
and being removed, sepa- 
rate the rib, placed in the 
direction df, b, e ; breaking it at the point c. If an entire 
rib is too much, a slice of meat may be taken from between 
two ribs. 

11. Leg of Pork, — [See Ham.] 

The stuffing, in a roast leg, will be found under the skin, 
at the thick end. 

12. Fore Quarter of Lamb. 

Separate, first,.the shoul- 
der from the scoven, which 
constitutes the ribs and the 
breast, by sliding the knife 
under the knuckle, in the 
direction of a, 5, c, leaving 
on the ribs a due proportion of meat. Place it on a different 
dish. Now squeeze half a Seville orange on the other 
part, which, being sprinkled with salt and pepper, should be 
carved^ in the direction c, d. This will separate the gristly 
part from the ribs. Now help from either, as may be the 
choice, carving as directed by the lines e, f 

13. Saddle of Mutton, 

Cut long slices, on each side 
of the back bone, in the direc- 
tion a, b. As some are fond of 
a joint of the tail, they can 
easily be served by cutting 
. between the joints. 





14. Breast of Veal. 



and of a gristly subataace. 
big to preference. 



Separate the ribs from 

the brisket by cutting 

k through the line a, b. The 

' brisket is the thickeatpart, 

Carve each; and help accord' 



15. FiUetof Veal. 

This lesembles a round 
of beef. Like that, it 
I should be carved hori- 
zon tally, or by taking 
thin even slices from the 
top, cutting deep into the 
flap, between a, b, for 
the stuffing. Help to each peraon.B portion of the dressing. 

16. Pig. 

This IB seldom sent to the 
table whole the cook first 
garnishing the dish with the 
chops and ears, and dividing 
* the body lengthwise. Sepa- 
rate a shoulder from the body next a leg and divide the 
ribs. The joints ma> be divided or the meat sliced from 
them. Some prefer the neck, though most the libs. Help 
with stuffing and gravy. 

If the head is not otherwise disposed of, the brains should 
be mixed with the gravy. 

17. Venison. 

Slices of a medium 
thickness may be giv- 
en, and plenty ofgiavy 
1( with them. Cut quit* 
[he bone in the line 
;, i ; then turn the 
dish with the end A, lonards you, and putting in the point 




» 



of the knife at c, cut as deep as possiUe in the direction 
c, d. You may now, at pleasure, slice from either side. 
As the fat lies deeper on the left, those who like fat, as 
ttiost venison eaters do, may be helped to the best flavored 
and fatest slices on the left of the hne c, d. 




18. Ham, 

Ham may be carved 
three different ways. 
Usually, commencing 
by long delicate pieces, 
cut to the bone through 
the thick fat, in the line 
a, b. A second way is, 
to cut a small round hole 
on the top, as at c, tak- 
The most saving way is to begin 




ing thin circular pieces. 
at the knuckle. 



19. A Fowl 

It will be more con- 
^ venient carving this to 
take it onto your plate, 
replacing the joints, a^ 
[a separated, neatly on the 
dish. Place the fork 
in the middle of the 
breast, and remove the wing in the direction of a, b, sepa- 
rating the joint at a, and lifting up the pinion with the fork, 
and drawing the entire wing towards the leg. This draw- 
ing will separate the fleshy part more naturally than cutting. 
Cut between the leg and the body at c, to the joint b. By 
giving the blade a sudden turn the joint will, break. Re- 
peat the same operation for the other wing and leg. Next, 
take off the merrythought by drawing the knife across the 
breast and turning the joint back; and then remove the 
two neck bones. Divide the breast from the back, by cut . 
ting through all the ribs, close to the breast. Turn the 
back up ; half way between the extreme ends press the 
point of the knife, and on raising the rump end the bont 



will part. Take off the sidesmen, haying turned tlfe nunp 
from you : — and done. 

The wings -should be made as handsome as possible. 
These, with the breast,, are the most delioate parts of dl« 
fowl ] the legs are mofe juicy. 

20. A Goose. 

£y ^ :...: :rrmr!r:x ^ With the neck end to- 

4^. — .-r-"i::::r:r:i~ll~i^^ ward you, to take off the 

llj^lt^!?' ^;;;;;;;^ ^ wing, put the fork into the 

l||t^^^^[H|j^v^W small end of the pinion and 

^^^^^^^^^■■•^^^^ press it close to the body, 
divide' the joint at a, carrying the knife along as far as h. 
Take off the leg by an incision from 6 to c, and separate 
the drumstick. Part the wing and leg from the other side, 
and between the lines 1 and 2, cut long slices from each 
side of the breast. The apron must be removed by cutting 
from d to e, by c, to get at the stuffing. The menythought 
being removed, the neck bones, and all other parts are to 
be divided as in a fowl. 

A Duck may be carved in a similar manner. 

21. Turkey, 

To carve, without withdrawing the fork, place your fork 
firmly in the lower part of the breast, so as to have the 
turkey at perfect command. It is not difficult to complete 
the entire carving of this fowl without extracting the f<^k 
till done : the whole back, of course, making one joint. 
Proceed to remove the wing ; the leg ; another wing and 
leg. (This may be done, either before, or after, slicing 
the breast.) Next, remove the merrythought, the neck 
bones, the neck itself; then, cutting through the ribs, the 
job is done. 

^ 22. Partridge, 

Carved as a fowl. Wings, breast, and merrythought, are 
the best parts. The two latter not often divided. T]^ 
wing the best joint The tip the vorjf beat. 



Vt) CAKTIIfG. 

23. Pigeons. 

Halve them, diyiding lengthwise ; or so as to make the 
breast and wings form one division. The lower divi&ion 
generally preferred. % 

Woodcocks, Grouse, ^c. are carved like fowls, if n^t 
too small ; when they must be cut in quarters. 

Snipes should only be halved. 

24. Hare. 

Insert the point .of the 
knife inside the shoulder at 
a. and separate the entire 
length to the rump at b. 
The other side being done 
in the same way, thje hare 
is in three pieces. Slide 
the knife under the rise of the shoulder at a, b, to remove 
it. Serve the leg in a similar manner. Next, decapitate. 
Take off the ears close ; and separate the jaws. Place the 
upper jaw flat on a plate, and putting the point of the knife 
into the forehead, bisect it through the centre of the cra- 
nium to the extreme end of the proboscis. Cut the back 
into convenient portions ; lay the pieces neatly on the dish, 
and proceed to serve the company, giving some stuffing, 
(which will be found inside the hare,) and gravy to each 
person. ^| 

The back and legs are prim^arts. By some, the ears 
ar6 considered a luxury. So also the head and brains. 
The tail is a rare delicacy. They may be distributed to 
those who like theiki. 

Should the hare not be very tender, it will be difficult to 
divide the sides from the l^ck ; but take off tbe legs by 
cutting through the joints. You will then be able jto cut a 
few slices from each side of the back. Next, dissever the 
shoulders, which ure called the sportsman's joints, and are 
preferred by many. The back, &c. may then be carved 
•t directed abov«

A WORD FOR THE DINNER-TABLE. 



As Host. --^ An invited company of ladies and gentlemen, 
each alternately seated at the dinner-table, and a blessing 
invoked ; you will dispatch soup to each, from a pile of 
plates on your right, without questioning any whether you 
shall help, them or not. Dealing it out silently ; you will 
help the person at your right hand, first ; then at your left, 
and so on. 

You will carve the meats yourself, of course. And you 
will not ask to be allowed to help your guests, but will 
supply a plate in silence, and hand it to your servants, who 
will offer it to such of the company as are unprovided. 
Never offer fish or soup a second time. 

If a dish be on the table, some parts of which are pre- 
ferred to others, according to the taste of individuals, all 
should have the opportunity of choice. Simply ask each 
one if he has any preference for a particular part. If. the 
reply is in the ne^tive, do^ Qot repeat the question, nor 
insist that he must nave a preference. So, where different 
dishes; do not insist on yoi|t guests partaking of a particular 
dish, nor ask persons more, than once. Never force a sup- 
ply upon their plates. ^ 

Do not attempt to eulogize your dishes, nor to apologize 
that you cannot recommend them* 

As Guest. — ^Being seated, when soup is offered take it ; 
but if you prefer fish, pass it to your neighbor. You must 
not ask for soup or fish a second time. 

If asked whether you have a preference for any dish, or 
^y particular part of a dish, answer plainly and diatiaetlyi 
M you 



IP 4 WP|U> FOR THE DIliNER-TABLE. 

Wbfin you are helped to any thing, do not wait till the 
rest of the company are served. 

Finally, to be at ease, is a great step toward enjoying 
your own dinner, and making yourself agreeable to the 
company.

Though the marketing and the carving, have been 
deemed of sufficient importance to give them the few pages 
allotted to them ; yet compared with the disposition, or the 
use made, of what comes into the hands of the housekeeper, 
these pages are but blank paper. The interim, the time 
between the marketing and the serving out, may emphati- 
cally be styled the housekeeper's time. 

When the weather will admit of it, meat will inlprove by 
keeping ; beef and mutton a week, in cold weather, and 
poultry half as long. It will soon spoil in hot weather. 
It should be kept away from flies ; where cool and airy ; 
and if in danger of spoiling, rub over it a little fine salt, and 
sprinkle with pepper. *It will not cook well, if frozenj|hen 
put to the fire, either to boil or to roast. It shomS be 
soaked in cold water till the frost is extracted. Furious 
boiling hardens meat. Put the part that is to be up at table, 
down in the pot, with just cold water enough to cover it ; 
and boil gently. The scum should be taken oif as soon as 
it rises. The slower the boiling, the tenderer the meat. 
As a general rule, do not let the vessel stop boiling till its 
contents are cooked. The observance of this rule is indis- 
pensible for good puddings, potatoes, Sic. Replenish with 
boiling water, if the addition of water be 'necessary.. 

When thickened and seasoned, the liquor in which all 
kinds of fresh meat are boiled, makes a good soup. Thus 
used, boiling is the cheapest way of cooking meat. Other- % 

wise, the dearest ; as most of the gelatine is extracted and 
lost. ^^ 

In ro€tsting meat, the juices and fat are only extracted, ^Hk 
but not lost, as they make good gravy ; and the fat is used ^^

tbr ▼arkras purposed. When pot down to roast, there dioiiU 

be a little water ia the dripping pan. 

For broiling, the gridiron should -be perfectly *clean, and 
oiled with lard or butter, to prevent the impression of ^e 
bars on the meat. The bars should be concave, terminat- 
ing in a trough, to save the juices, and thus prevent smoking 
the meat by the burning of the drippings. The gndiron 
should be heated before the meat is laid on it ; and a good 
fire of live coals is \ necessary, to have the meat broil as 
quick as possible, without burning. The receiving dish 
should be very hot, and the meat not seasoned till placed 
xxj^n it. 

To fry meat, first, slice a small piece of pork, and fry a 
light brown, and take up. Then, put in your meat, per- 
fectly dry. When done enough, take it up. Remove the 
pan to cool ; when cool, turn in a little cold water for the 
gravy, and place it on the fire ; when it boils, stir in a little 
mixed flour and water ; let it boil; then pour it over the 
meat. Add butter and catsup, if not rich enough. 

27. Rwist Beef. 

The best pieces for roasting, as will be seen by looking 
at the engraving, are the tenderloin, and the first and second 
rib cuts. The two next are good. 

The bony sides should first be placed towards the fire, 
on putting the meat down, with a little salt sprinkled over 
the whole. After the bones are well heated through, turn 
the meat, and keep a brisk fire. While roasting, bante it 
often. When the meat is put down, a little water should 
be put into the dripping pan. 

A thick piece of meat requires fifteen or twenty minutes 
to the pound, to roast ; if a thin piece, fewer minutes will 
do it. 

28. Roast Beef Southern Mode. 

Select a rib roasting-piece, that has hung ton of fourteen 

days ; bone it nicely ; rul) salt over it ; roll it tight ; bind it

* To avoid repetition, it needs but be mentioned hart, that every thing 
pertaining to cookery should be ferfudy clean, not excepting operatoi 
ttor operatreia. 



Moond with twiae; put the 9pit through the inner fold, 

without sticking it into the flesh ; skewer, and roast it well ; 
^bedge and froth it, when about done ; and garnish with 
•en^d horse radish. 

39. Beef Steak, Broiled. 

The round and clod make gopd steaks, but the inside of 
the sirloin is the best. 

Lay the steak on a gridiron, placing it on a bed of hot 
coals, and broil as quick as possible without burning. FronT 
fifteen to twenty minutes will be required. Turn it often. 

For eight pounds of beef, cut up from three to five ounces 
of butter ; heat the platter very hot, that is to receive the 
steak ; lay the butter on it ; take up the steak ; salt and 
pepper both sides. To be good, it should be eaten imme- 
diately while hot. Very little butter, if a few slices of salt 
pork be broiled with the beef, will make a good gravy. 

30. Beef Steak, Southern Mode, 

For steaks, the best part is the seventh and eighth ribs : 
the fat and lean being better mixed, and more tender than 
the rump. 

Cut them half an inch thick, and beat them a little ; broil 
quick, turning them often ; have a dish very hot ; put some 
slices of onion in it ; lay in the steaks ; sprinkle a little 
salt ; pour on them one spoonful of water, and one of mush- 
room catsup, boiling hot ; garnish with scraped horse radish ; 
and put on a hot dish-cover. 

31. Beef Steak, Fried, 

Such pieces as are good for broiling, are also good foi 
frying. 

Brown a few pieces of salt pork ; take them up ; put in 
your beef; when brown on both sides, take it up and re- 
move the pan to let the fat cool. When cool, pour in four 
spoonfuls of water ; mix two teaspoonfuls of fiour with a 
little water ; mix it with the fat ; replace the pan on the 
fire ; stir it till it boils up ; pour it over the beef. 





w9i "I IS>j4kTS • 

32. Liver, _ 

Beef's liver is good fried, but is best broiled about ten 
minutes, with salt pork ; then cut both into small strips ; 
put them in a stew pan, with a little water, butter, and pep- 
per ; stjBW about five minutes. First, scald the liver. 

33. Alamode Seef. , 

The round is best. The shoulder clod is cheapest ; is 
good, too, stewed without spices. 

For ^ve pounds of alamode beef, soak a pound of bread 
in cold water till soft, turn off' the water, mash the bread 
fine ; add a piece of butter of a hen's egg size, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of ground cloves, of all- 
spice, of pepper, half a nutmeg, two eggs, and a spoonful 
of flour: mix all well together; gash the beef; fill with 
half the dressing; place it in a bake pan, with lukewarm 
water enough to cover it ; cover the pan with the lid heated, 
and set it where it will stew gently two hcMirs ; then: turn 
on the top the other half of. the dressing, and heat the lid 
hot enough to brown it. Stew an hour and a half longer. 
On taking up the meat, if the gravy is not thick enough, 
mix, with a little water, a teaspoonful or two of flour,. and 
stir into the gravy ; add a little butter, a;nd a glass of wine, 
and turn it over the meat. 

34, To Frizjzle Beef, 

Shave off" very thin pieces of tender, fresh smoked beef ; 
put tham in a stew pan, with just sufficient water to cover 
them, and let them stew ten or fifteen minutes. Three or 
four minutes before taking up, stir in a mixture of a little 
flour and water, to thicken the water, adding a little pepper 
and butter, A. good dish for breakfast — accpmpanied with 
eggs, iStill better. 

35. Bailed Beef. 

The perfection in boiling beef is, to boil slowly, and to 
skim the pot well. If the scum boil in, by adhering to ^e 
meat, it causes a dirty appearance. The boiling may ^.t 
any time be checked, by removing partially, or entirely, the 
,pot-lid. 



MEATS. M 

In hot weather, it is so difficult to keep beef sweet, it is 
best to com it in the pot, as it is boiled. Put in a teacijqp 
of salt t6 eight pounds of beef; sprinkle £our on the side 
that is to lay up on the dish, and lay it down in the pot ; 
pour water into the pot, enougk to cover the meat, and 
keep it covered, afver the meat is put in. > Boil two hours; 
add more cold water, and boil another hour and a half. 

36. To Collar a Flank of Beef, 

Take a sele<!:t flank of beef; rub it well with salt and a 
large portion of saltpetre ; let it lie ten days ; then wash it 
clean ; remove the inner and outer skin, with the gristle : 
spread it on a board, and cover the inside with the follow- 
ing mixture ; sage, parsley, thyme chopped fine, pepper, 
salt, and pounded cloves. Roll it up ; sew over it a cloth ; 
bandage that with tape ; boil gently, from five to six hours ; 
take it out ; when cold, place it on a board without imdoing 
it ; put another board on the top, with a heavy weight on it ; 
let it lay twenty-five hours ; take ofl" the bandages ; cut a 
slice from each end ; garnish with sprigs of parsley and 
green pickles, and serve it up. 

37, Curries. 

Veal, Mutton chops, chickens, pigeons, and lobsters, all 
make good curries. Joint your fowls, if a fowl curry-dish 
is to be made ; boil them in barely suflicient water to cover 
them, till tender ; add a little salt. Fry, till brown, three 
or four slices of pork, just before the fowls are done enough 
to take up. Take up the pork, and put in the chickens ; 
brown them ; then add part of the liquor in which they 
were boiled, a te^ooonful or two of curry powder, and the 
fried pork. ^ Mixl™&aspoonful of curry powder with twelve 
spoonfuls of boiled rice, or with a mixture of a litfl^ flpur 
and water ; pour it on the curry, and stew a few nj^utes. 

38. Sweetbread, Heart, and Liver. * 

Fry sweetbread, moderately, where two or three pieces 
of salt pork have been browned and taken up. On remov- 
ing the sweetbread, stir into the fat two teaspoonfuls of 
flour mixed with a little water. On boiling, pour it over the 
sweetbread. 



88 tfBATt. 

Anodisr way. — Parboil the sweetbread ; let it get eoM | 
dice it in inch thick pieces ; dip them in the joik of aa 
egg and fine bread crumbs, first sprinkled with pepper, salt, 
and fine sage ; brown them lightly. Mixing smooth, a little 
flour and water, make & gravy by stirring ikpm into the fat 
Add spices and wine if liked. 

The heart and liver may be cooked in the same way. 

39. To Brown Mince Meat. 

Mince cold roast beef very fine, fat and lean ; add salt, 
pepper, chopped onion, and a little gravy ; fill scollop tins 
two-thirds full, and fill up with potatoes mashed smooth 
with cream ; lay a piece of butter on the top, and browii 
them in an oven. 

40. Tripe, 

After being thoroughly scoured, tripe should be sodded 
in salt and water about a week, shifting the water every 
eight and forty hours ; then boil till tender, or from eight to 
ten hours ; then pickle, fry or broil. Pickle it the same IM 
souse. 

41. Meats Warmed Over, 

Roasted or boiled veal makes a good dish, chopped fine 
and just moistened with water, seasoned with a little butter, 
pepper, and salt, and warmed up. A little nutmeg and the 
yellow part of a lemon rind, grated fine, improve it. When 
well heated, take it up, and garnish it with two lemons cut 
in slices. 

Salt or fresh beef is good, chopped fine, with boiled po* 
tfttoes, and warmed up with a little wa^L pepper, and sidt; 
add a little butter just before you take^nip. 

Boiled turnips, or onions, instead of potatoes, are good 
mixed -With minced meat. 

Mutton, lamb, and veal, are good cut into small strips, 
and warmed with bgiled potatoes sliced, with a little water, 
salt, and pepper ; add butter just before taking up. 

Rare roast beef and mutton are nice sliced and just 
warmed on a gridiron. 

Meat that is warhied over, should be on the fire just long 
•nough to heat through. 



£iittkLfowi^««rej|iijp, joisted and wanoed wkhA fitde winter* 
^«n,t£^keQ up and fried brown in a little buttqr, Spriuikic 
A;litdeifiour an them before frying. Thicken the wai&r in 
•vbioh the fowls were warmed, adding butter, pepper^ and 
salt, and then turnit on the fowls. 

42. Veal 

The best piece of veal for roasting is the loin. The 
'Inreast and rack are^ood also; Tlie breast makes a good ' 

potpie, and the rack is good, cut into pieces and broi}«^. 
•The leg is fine for frying ; and after several slices have 

been taken off for cutlets, the rest is nice for boiling with a 
'Jpiece of sait pork. 

43. Roast Veal, 

For roasting, veal should be peppered, salted, rubbed 
over with a little butter, and frequently basted. A little 
water should be put in the dripping pan, and if the meat is 
ijot qujte fat, a little butter should be added. 

44. Baked Veal* 

yox baking, the fillet is good. The bone should be cut 
tiyt, and its place filled with a dressing made of bread 
^^soa^ked soft in cold water, two eggs, pepper, salt, and a JA|- 

^spponful of melted butter, then sewed up. Put it in the 
'feake pan, with a pint of water ; and, with some of the dress- 
,ifl5> cQver the top of the meat. When done, on taking up, 
thicken the gpravy with a little flour and water well mixed, 
pyttiijig in a small piece of butter, and a little wine and cat- 
i^Wt if a rich gravy is liked. 

^f^mi^eal and Chicken Potpie, 

Joint the chickens, if made of them, and boil them till 
half done j take them out ; put them^ dry, into a pot, making 
alterriate layers of crust and fowl, seasoned with pepper 
and salt ; then, pour in the liquor in which the fowls were 
boiled, upon the upper layer of crust, which covers the 
fowls. If a brown crust is desired : with a heated bake 
pan lid, keep the pot covered. Add, from- the teakettle, 
ibofrling water, as that in the pot wastes. Raised piecrust ^ * • 
is preferable to that made for fruit pies, though, if bt;tiilittie 



S8 

Bhortened, that is good. For raised crust, mix a teaspoon- 
fill of salt, and a teacup of melted butter, with three pints of 
flour, and then pour in half a teacup of yeast, adding cold 
water to ma^ke it stiff enough to roll out ; placing it whore 
warm, it will require from seven to eight hours to rise, un- 
less you use brewer's yeast. Roll it out, when risen, and 
cut it into small cakes. 

Potato pie crust is good. Peel and mash fine eight 
boiled potatoes ; mix with them half a pint of milk, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a hen's egg si;&e piece of butter, and flour 
enough for rolling out. Put with the meat, the cakes after 
rolled out and cut. ' 

By working into unbaked wheat dough, a little melted 
lukewarm butter, nice crust may be made. Before putting 
it with the meat, let it lay ten or fifteen minutes, after it ii 
cut and rolled into cakes. 

46. Veal Cutlets, 

Fry, till brown, three or four slices of salt pork ; take 
them up, and put in slices of veal, cut from the leg, about 
an inch thick ; when brown on both sides, take them up ; 
stir into the gravy, half a pint of water, and mix two or 
three teaspoonfuls of flour with a little water, and stir in j 
soak two slices of toasted bread in the gravy ; lay them on 
the bottom of the platter ; place the meat and pork over 
them, and turn on the gravy. 

A very nice way of cooking cutlets is, with half a pint 
of milk, an egg beaten to a froth, and flour enough to ren- 
der it thick, to make a batter. When fried brown, dip the 
veal into the batter, then replace it in the fat, and fry until 
it is brown again. If any batter is letak is flne dropped 
by spoonfuls into the fat and fried brow^and placed over 
the veal. Thicken the gravyj and turn it over the whole. 
This dish requires an hour's cooking ; and it will be best to 
stew the meat half an hour before frying it, if it is tough. 

47. To Broil Cdfs Liver. 

Cut the liver in slices, not very thin ; salt and pepper it, 
after nicely broiling, and pour on some melted butter, with 
chopped parsley, aAer it is dished. 



IMAtf; It 

48. Force Meat B<dU. 

Mix, with a pound of line chopped vetll, one egg, a little 
butter, or raw pork chopped fine, and season wim salt and 
pepper, or curry powder. Fry iheih brown, done up iki 
small balls. 

4d. CalfsHead. 

With the lights and feet, boil the head abont two hours, 
and the liver forty minutes. Tie the brains in a bag and 
boil them with the head, befcnre it is done. When all are 
done, tfkke them up ; season them with butter, salt, pepper, 
and sweet herbs, or spices if liked, and use them as a 
dressing for the head. Part of the liver, and of the feet, 
ifiay be prepared like the brains, for such as prefer them, 
for a dressing. 

The liquor that the head i9 boiled in makes a nice soup, 
prepared in a plain way, like any other veal soup, or tuf' 
tleited. It should stand till the next day, that the fat may 
be skimmed off which rises. 

To have the head look brown, take it up when tender ; 
rub a little butter over it ; sprinkle on allspice, pepper, salt, 
and flour, and place it before the fire, under a Dutch oven, 
or in a brick one where it will brown quick. With a little ijftt 

water, salt, pepper, and butter, warm up the brains. Add 
spices and wine if liked. Serve it up as a dressing for the 
head. 

Baked calf's head is also good. Halve, and rub butter 
over it ; put it in a pan, with a quart of water ; then cover 
it with a dressing made of bread soaked soft, a little butter, 
and an egg, seasoned with salt, pepper, and pulverize4 
mace. Slice up tllb brains, and place them, with the head, 
in the pan. Bake it in a quick oven, and garnish with 
force meat balls, or with slices of lemon. 

50. Calf s Feet 

Boiling them with the head, till both are tender, split, and 
lay them round it ; or, after boiling them tender, and dredg- 
ing them with flour, fry them brown. If a ^avy for thoi^ 
is wished : after taking them up» stir somo floW' u$Q tbe (^ 



4K) UMATA, 

in which they were fried ; season to taste, adding butter^ 
and wine if wished, then turn the gravy over the meat. 

51. Scotch CoUops. 

Take some very thin pieces . of beef ot veal ; rub with 
butter the bottom of an iron stewpan that has a cover to 
closely fit it ; put in the meat, some pepper, salt, a large 
onion, and an apple minced very fin^ ;- cover the pan, and 
let the meat stew till very tender. Serve it hot, 

52. To Grill a Calf's Head, 

Clean and divide th)e head as for mock turtle ; take out 
the brains and tongue ; boil the head tender ; take the eyes 
out whole, and cut the flesh from the skull part in small 
pieces. Take some of the water the head was boiled in 
for gravy ; add to this gravy, cayenne pepper, salt, a grated 
nutmeg, and a spoonful of lemon pickle : simmer this till 
the gravy is well flavored. Next, take the chop, pick out 
the bones ; cover it with bread crumbs, chopped parsley, 
pepper, and salt, and set it in the oven to brown* Then, 
thicken the gravy with the yolks of two eggs and a spoon- 
ful of butter rubbed into two of flour, and stew the skull 
part in it a few minutes ; put tHis part on the dish ; and 
complete the whole dish by placing the grilled chop on it) 
garnishing with brain cakes and broiled sweetbread. 

53. Veal Olives, 

Cut thin slices off a fillet, and flatten them ; season them 
highly with pepper, salt, mace, and grated lemon peel ; roll 
up in each slice a bit of fat and tie it with a thread. Fry 
them of a light brown, and stew them \% white stock, (pre- 
pared for soups or gravies,) with two do^en of fried oysters, 
a glass of white wine, a spoonful of lemon pickle, and some 
small mushrooms. Stew them nearly an hour. Take the 
threads off before serving. 

54* R(^out of Cold Veal, 

Cut a necl^ loin, or fillet of veal into handsome cutlets ; 
pat clean drippings, or a piece of butter, into a frying pan ; 
when it is hot| flour, and fry the veal of a light brown; take 



it out ; and if you have no gravy prepared i^ake the follow . 
ing: put a pint of boiling water into the frying pan; let it 
boil up a minute, and strain it into a basin while you make 
a thickening; put about an ounce of butter into a stew pan; 
when it melts, mix with it sufficient flour to absorb the but- 
ter ; stir it over the fire a few minutes, and gradually add 
the gravy made in the frying pan ; let them simmer together 
about ten minutes ; season it with pepper, salt^ a little mace, 
and a glass of wine, or mushroom catsup ; strain it through 
a tamis, (coarse cloth strainer,) on to the meat, and stew 
the meat very gently till it is thoroughly warmed. Slicea 
of boiled ham may be warmed with the meat.. 

55. Mutton. 

Mutton is in its greatest perfection from August to Christ- 
mas. For roasting or boiling allow fifteen minutes for each 
pound. The saddle should always be roasted, and gar.- 
nished with scraped horse radish. The leg and shoulder 
are good roasted ; but the best way of cooking the leg is to 
boil it with a bit of sialt pork. If a little rice is boiled with 
it the flesh will look whiter. 

For roasting, mutton should have & little butter rubbed 
over it, and salt and pepper sprinkled on it. Allspice a^d 
cloves, some like. Put a piece of butter in the dripping pan, ^, 

and baste it often. The bony part should first be presented 
to the fire, for roasting. 

The leg is good to bake, gashed and filled with a dress- 
ing made of soaked bread, pepper, salt, butter, and two eggs. 
A pint of water, and a little butter should be put in the pan. 

The leg is good, too, sliced and broiled. Also boiled, 
a^er' corned a few days. 

The rack is good for broiling.' Each bone should be 
separated, broiled quick, buttered, salted, and peppered. 

The breast is fine baked. The joints of the brisket 
should be separated ; the sharp ends of the ribs saw^d ofif; 
the outside rubbed over with a small piece of butter; salted; 
and put into a bake pan, with half a pint of water. When 
baked enough, take it up, and thicken the gravy with a little * 

flour and water, adding a small piece of butter. A spoonful 
of catsup, cloves and allspice, improve it. The neck mak«s 
a good soup.

56. To Harrieot Mutton, 

Take the best part of the rack ;. divide it into chops, one 
bone in each ; beat them flat ; sprii^e pepper and salt on 
them, and broil them nicely. Make a rich gravy out of the 
coarser parts ; season well with pepper, spice, and catsup ; 
strain it when done ; and thicken with butter and brown 
flour. Have ready some carrots and turnips cut into small 
dice and boiled tender : put them in the gravy, and lay 
the chops in, and stew all fifteen minutes. Garnish with 
green pickles, and serve up. 

r 

57. Shoulder of Lamb, Grilled. 

Cut the shoulder, moderately deep, in checkers an inch 
long ;^rub the yolk of an egg and a little butter 'over it ; roll 
it- in finely powdered bread crumbs ; sprinkle on pepper, 
salt, and sweet herbs, and roast it a light brown. Use for 
it plain gravy, or the following : — Set on the fire, a gill of 
water with a gill of the drippings from the meat, and when 
it boils, thicken it with a Httle flour and water, adding a 
spoonful of tomato catsup, with the grated rind and juice 
of a lemon, seasoning with pepper and salt. 

68. Lamb^s Fry. 

The sweetbread and heart are ^opd fried plainly, or dip- 
ped into an egg and fine bread crumbs. Fry in lard. 

59. Irish Stew. 

Take five thick mutton chops, or two pounds of the neck 
or loin, two pounds of potatoes peeled and halved, and half 
a pound of onions peeled and sliced : first, place a layer of 
potatoes at the bottom of your stew pan ; then, two chops 
and some of the onions ; repeat this process till the pan i» 
quite lull ; add half a spoonful of pepper, a spoonful of salt, 
three gills of gravy, and two teaspoonfuls of mushropajb 
catoup ; cover so close as to prevent the escape of steam, 
and stew, on a very slow fire, an hour and a half. A sUqa 
of. ha,m improyes the dish very much. Take care it d96» 
not bum.

60. . Pork Steaks. 

Slice tbem from a neck or loin ; trim them handsomely, 
and pepper them ; broil them twenty minutes over a clear 
fire, turning them frequently. When done, salt and butter 
them on the jdate. 

61. To Broil Ham. 

Ham is better broiled than fried. Slice it thin, and broil 
the slices on a gridiron. When dished, place a fried egg 
on each slice, and serve out. It should be broiled, over 
bright hot coals, from five to eight minutes, turning it once. 

62. To Boil Ham, 

Put it on in cold water, and let it simmer, without boil- 
ing, unless very moderately, four or five hours. The water 

t ii^ 

pepper or cloves in diamond figures, if you wish to ornameir 
it. A ham, if very dry, should be soaked from twelve to 
twenty-four hours in warm water before cooking. 



should be changed if the ham is very salt. Before it it 
carried to the table, take off the rind. Put over it wh< ^ 



63. To Toast Ham. 

After boiling it well, take the skin off; cover the top 
thick with bread crumbs^, and brown it in an oven, 

64. To Stuff Ham, 

Take a ham well smoked and washed, and make inci- 
sions all over the top two inches deep; stuff them ywZ/ with 
chopped parsley and some pepper. Do not take off the 
skin. Eat it cold, after boiled. 

65, Baked or Roast Pig. 

Take out the inwards ; take off the first joint of the feet; 
boil both tender, and chop them. Make a dressing of bread 
soaked soft, the water pressed out, and mashed fine ; season 
with pepper, salt, and sage, adding a little butter, and then 
fill the pig with this stuffing. To prevent blistering, rub a 
little butter on the outside of tho pig. Roast or bake it two 
and a half or three hours. The pan, in which the pig is 



i*4 

baked should contain a little water. When done, mix, with 
a little dressing and ^ravy from the pan, the chopped feet 
.^^ ipwaids, .^Ited, peppered, and buttered, and psie this 
for fi. sauce. Expose the pig to the open air two or three 
JWnntes, first rubbing it over with a little butter, before it 
is put on the table, to make it crisp.

Akito four quarters, each weighing six potmds. Make save- 
Tai incisions between the ribs of a fore quarter, and stuff it 
with rich f<»ce meat ; put it in a pan with a pint of water, 
salt, pepper, two cloves of garlic, a tumber of good red wine, 
and one of mushroom catsup; bake it, and thicken the 
j||i8vy with brown flour and butter. To facilitate the carv- 
ings joint and cut the ribs before cooking. Lay the libs i^

67. Souse. 



rr Clean pig's feet and ears thoroughly, and soak them a 
number of days in salt and water ; boil them tender, and 
split them. They are good fried. 

To souse them cold, pour boiling vinegar over them, 
spiced with mace and pepper-corns. Cloves give them, a 
dark color, but they improve their taste. If a little salt be 
added, they will keep good, pickled, for a month or two.

68. Pressed Head. 

Boil the several parts of the entire head, and the feet, in 
the s&me way as for souse. All must be boiled so perfectly- 
tender as to have the meat easily separate .from the bones. 
After neatly separated^ chop the meat fine, while warm, 
seasoning with salt, and pepper, and other spices to taste. 
Put it in a strong bag, and, placing a weight on it, let it 
.sdSmin till cold. Or put it in any convenient dish, placing 
a. plate with a weight on it, to press the meat. Cat it in 
^sUoes, roll in flour, and fry in laid.

69. Sausages. 

Chop, very fine, fat and lean fresh poik ; (there should 
be a greater proportion of the lean,) season it very highlv* 
with pepper, salt, sage, and other sweet herbs if liked. A 
little saltpetre tends^ to preserve them. ~ Do up a litde into 
a cake, and fry it, to know when they are seasoned enough. 
When seasoned enough, fill youY skins, which should he 
perfectly clean. To v prevent ihe fat running out while 
cooking, mix in with the meat a little flour. Done up in 
small balls and fVied, sausage meat is good. 

When fVesh pork cannot be had, very good sausage caked • 
may be made of raw beef, chopped fine with salt pork, and 
seasoned with sage and pepper. When fried they should 
not be pricked, as the sausages will cook nicef to have a 
little fat put with them in the frying pan. They should be 
cooked moderately. If not liked very fiat, finish them o^,^ 
the gridiron, after the sausages have been fried till near|Pr 
done. 

To make Bologna sausages, take equal weight of veal, 
pork, and ham, chopped very fine, seasoned high, and boiled 
till tender, in casings, and then dry them. 

70. Venison, 

Venison is said to be most easily digested of any sort of 
meat. It is good for those who have weak and slow diges- 
tive powers. It shdiild be kept two weeks, if the weather 
permit, after it is killed, and then roasted before a clear, 
strong fire. 

71. To Roast Venison, 

Cover the fat parts with paper and a paste made of flour 
and water to prevent their burning. Roast a haunch of 
twelve pounds about four hours. Baste it well. Serve it 
out with current jelly. 

72. Venison Steaks. 

m 

Broil or fry venison steaks in the same manner as veid 
cutlets, or mutton chops. 



M FOWLS. 



73. Mock Venison. 

Mutton is the best substitute for real venison. Hang up, 
for several days, a large loin of fat mutton ; then bone it, 
and take off all the kidney fat, and the skin from the upper 
fat ; mix together two ounces of brown sugar, one ounce 
of pulverized black pepper, and two of allspice ; rub it well 
into the mutton ; keep the mutton covered with the skin, 
and rub and turn it daily f^e days. When to be roasted, 
cover it with the skin, and pepper it the same as for veni- 
son, first washing from it entirely the 8pice». Roast about 
the same time as for real venison. Serve it with made 
gravy and currant jelly.

74. Poultry, 

\ No sort of animal food is so delicate and delicious as that 

fowls and birds ; and none so generally healthful. Sei- 
m does it disagree with those in health. The feeble in 
constitution, and such as are debilitated by sickness, find 
the flesh of fowl a nutritious and most agreeable diet. 

When well boiled, jthe white meat of a young turkey is 
easier of digestion tkati that of any other fowl. 

75. Turkey, 

Wash the turkey thoroughly, inside and out, having taken 
out the inwards. Take bread, drained and mashed fine, 
after soaked in cold water, for the dressing. Mix with the 
dressing a small piece of melted butter, or salt pork chopped 
fine. Season it with pepper and salt, sweet herbs if liked. 
It cuts smoother if an egg is added. Any kind of cooked 
meat is good, minced fine and mixed with the dressing. 
The inwards ought to be boiled very tender, if they are to 
be used ; it is difficult to cook them through while the tur- 
key is roasting. The body and crop of the turkey must be 
filled with the dressing, and sewed up. Tie up the wings 
and legs, and rub on a little butter and salt. For roasting, 
twenty-five minutes to the pound is the rule. At first it 
should be roasted slowly, and basted frequently. When 
ihe fowl is put down to roast, a little water should be put 
into the dripping pan. Take the liquor the inwards are 



90WIM 47 

\ 

boiled in, for a pn,Ty, adding a litde of the tark^y dr^pings. 
Place it where it will boil, thickening with a little flout and 
water, first mixed smooth. Season it with pepper, salt, 
and sweet heirbs if liked. 

For boiling, the turkey is prepared in a similar way to 
the above. Parsley, lemon peel, and oysters may be added 
to the stuffing. Drawn butter is used when served out. 
If it is wished to have it look white, tie it up in a cloth, un- 
less you boil rice in the pot. Put m eight spoonfuls Of rice, 
if rice is used. It is improved by the boiling of a pound 
or two of salt pork with it. If a soup is to be made of the 
liquor in which the turke^is boiled, let it stand till next 
day, and skim off the fat. Season it after heated. 

76. Chickens. 

These, whether for boiling or roasting, should have a 
dressing prepared as for turkies. Six spoonfuls of rice 
boiled .with the chickens, will cause them to look whity. 
If the water is cold when they are put in, they will be less 
liable to break. They are improved by boiling a little salt 
pork with them ; if not thus boiled they will need salt. 

For broiling, chickens should be split; the inwards taken 
out ; and then washed. Broil very slowly, till brown, plac- 
ing the bony side down on the gridiron ; then, turning it, 
brown the other side. Forty minutes is the medium time 
for broiling a chicken. 

For roast chicken, boil the gizzard and liver by them- 
selves, and use the water for gravy. Put in the gravy the 
inwards chopped fine. 

77. Fricassee Chickens, 

The chickens should be washed, afler jointing and takiilg 
out the inwards. With the skin side down, place them m 
a stew pan, sprinkling pepper and salt on each layer ; add 
three or four slices of pork ; just cover with water, and stew 
them till tender. On taking them up, mix a little flour and 
water ; thicken the liquor in which they were stewed ; add 
a hen's egg size piece of butter ; replace the chickens in 
the stew, pan, and let them stew about ^\e minutes longer. 
When the chickens are taken up, soak, in the gravy, two 
' or three pieces of toast, and put them in your nl»^tcr« ^4ft96 
3 



4i MtTLi. 

«be diickens on the toast, and pour the graty ovei* them. 
If you want the chiokens browned, stew them till tender 
without the pork, then brown the pork ; take ihat up ; then, 
putting in the chickens, fry them till of a light broWn. 

78. To Fricassee SmaU Chickens,--^ Southern Mode. 

Cut off the wings and legs of four chickens ; separate 
the breasts from the backs ; divide the backs crosswise ; 
cut off the necks ; clean the gizzards ; put them, with the 
livers, and other parts of the chicken, after being thoroughly 
washed, into a sauce pan ; aid salt, pepper, and a little 
mace ; cover with water, and stew till tender. Take them 
up ; thicken half a pint of water with two spoonfuls of flour 
rubbed into four ounces of butter ; add a tumbler of new 
milk ; boil all together a few minutes, then add eight spoon- 
fuls of white wine, stirring it in carefully, so as not to cur- 
dle ; put in the chickens, and shake the pan till they are 
sufficiently heated, then serve them up. 

79. Chickens Baked in Rice, 

Joint a chicken, as for fricassee ; with pepper and salt 
season it well ; place it in a pudding dish lined with slices 
of bacon or of ham ; add an onion finely minced, and a pint 
of veal gravy ; pile up the dish full with boiled rice well 
pressed ; cover it with a paste of flour and water, and bake 
m a slow oven one hour. If veal gravy be wanting, sub^ 
stitute water, with additional seasoning and ham. 

80. Goose. 

A goose should be dressed in the same manner, and 
roasted the same length of time as a turkey. Be particu- 
lar to select one that is tender. See marketing plates. 

If any fowls are injured but slightly, by too long keeping, 
dip them in weak salaeratus water before cooking, or rinse 
the inside with sharp vinegar. Strong camomile tea may 
be used. 

81 . To Stew Partridges, 

Truss a brace of partridges like fowls for boiling; pound 
the livers with ^wice tlie qiasnttty of ist bacon and bread 



crumbs boiled ia milk ; add some mnshrcknns and chopped 
parsley, mace, grated lemou peel^ salt, and pepper ; stuff 
them ; tie them at each end, and place them in a stew pan 
lined with bacon. If you have it, add a quart of good grsLvy, 
If not, two onions, water, a few blades of mace, and a bunch 
of sweet herbs. Stew gently till they are tender ; takelthem 
out ; strain, and thicken the sauce with flour and butter ; 
heat, and pour it on the birds. 

82. Pige&ns, 

Lay pigeons in a pot breast side down, the inwards being 
first taken out, and they prepared with a turkey-like dress- 
ing ; pour in more than sufficient water to cover them ; put 
in four ounces of butter to every twelve pigeons, when 
stewed nearly tender, stirring into the gravy two or three 
teaspooniuls of flour mixed with a little water. Put on a 
heated bake pan lid, if you wish to brown them, one hour 
before they are done ; or, soon as tender, fry them in pork 
fat. They are good, split open amd stewed, with a dress- 
ing made and warmed up separately with a little of the 
gravy. If tender, pigeons are good stuffed and roasted. 
From two to three hours are requisite to cook pigeons. 
When put to the fire, roast pigeons should be buttered. 



83. To Stew Pigeons. 

Clean and wash six pigeons ; quarter them ; with them, 
put all their giblets into a stew pan, a little water, butter, 
salt, pepper, a bit of lemon peel, two blades of mace, and 
some chopped 'parsley ; stew till tender in a closely cov- 
ered pan. Thicken the gravy with the mixture of an egg 
beaten up ; three spoonfuls of cream, and a piece of butter 
dusted with flour. Stew them ten minutes longer. Ex^- 
cellent. — Economical. 

84. Ducks, 

They are good roasted, or stewed lUte pigeons. The 
fishy taste wild ducks have, is entirely taken out by having 
an onicm dressing.

50 ftABBlT. 



86. To Boa a Duck, 

Make a paste of half a pound of butter to a {Mdund oi 
flour ; truss the duck, putting mto the inside a little salt aiid 
pepper, one or two sage leaves, and a little onion finely 
minced ; inclose the duck in the paste, with a little jellied 
gravy. Boil it in a cloth, and serve it with brown gravy 
poured round it. 

86. To S$ew Ducks. 

Cut one or two ducks into quarters ; fry them a light 
brown in butter ; put them into a sauce pan ; add a pint of 
gravy, four onions whole, pepper, salt, a bunch of parsley, 
two sage leaves, a sprig of winter savory, and sweet mar- 
joram ; cover the pan closely and stew them till tender, 
Take out the herbs and pepper ; skim it. If the sauce is 
not sufficiently thick, mix, with two spoonfuls of it, a little 
floiur and stir it into the sauce pan ; let it boil up, and gar- 
nish the dish with four onions. 

Ducks and geese, if old, are better if parboiled before 
they are roasted. Put them on in just sufhcient water to 
boil them ; keep the vessel closely covered. Let a tough 
goose simmer two hours ; then dry and wipe it thoroughly ; 
stuff and roast, basting at first with a little butter. 

9 

87. To Roast Ducks. 

Put into a pair of ducks, an onion chopped fine, and a 
few sage leaves, pepper, and salt ; spit, and dust them with 
flour, and baste them with lard. It oast half an hour, with 
a very hot fire. The quicker roasted, the better they will 
taste. Dust them with flour, and baste them, just before 
^^ taking them from the spit. Prepare a gravy of the gizzards 

^^ and pinions, a large mace blade, a few pepper-corns, a tea- 

spoonful of lemon pickle-, and a spoonful of catsup ; strain, 
and turn it on the ducks. Send onion sauce in a boat. 

88. To Roast Rabbits. 

After casing two rabbits, skewer their heads with their 
mouths upon their backs; stick their forelegs into their 



libs ; skewer, the hind legs dpobled ; nexi, saake a stuffing 
for them of the crumbs of half a loaf of bread, a little 
parsley, sweet marjoram, and thyme — all cut fine, pepper, 
salt, aii||f nutmeg, to your taste ; niix them all into a light 
stuffing, with four ounces of butter, a little good cream, and 
two eggs ; put it into their bodies, and sew them up ; dredge 
and baste them well with lard ; roast them about an hour. 

a. ' 

Serve them up with butter and parsley. Chop the livers, 
and lay them in lumps round the edge af the cQsh. 

89. To Dress Turtle. 

Cut off the head in the morning^ in summer ; at evening, 
in the winter ; hang it up by the hind fins, and let it bleed 
well J with care, separate the bottom shell from the top, lest 
you break the gall bladder, which, with care, take out and 
throw away ; throw the liver into a bowl of water ; empty 
the chitterlings, (guts,) and throw them into water; the 
eggs also, if any — ^have a separate bowl for each article; 
slice all the meat from the under shell, and throw that in 
water; break in pieces the shell ; wash clean and put it in 
a pot, completely covering it with water, and add to it one 
pound of middling, (or fiitch of bacon,) with four chopped 
onions, and set it on the fire to boil. Open the chitterlings ; 
clean them thoroughly"; take off the inside skin, and put 
them' in the pot with the shell; let them' boil three hours 
steadily ; if the water boils away too much add more. 

The tcfp : — Wash the top shell neatly, after cutting out 
all the meat ; cover, and set it by. 

Parboil the fins ; elean them perfectly, taking off all the 
black skin, and throw them into water. Now cut the flesh . 
taken from both shells, in small pieces ; cut the fins in two, 
and lay them in a dish with the flesh ; sprinkle over some 
salt, and cover up the dish. ^l 

When the shell, chitterlings, <fcc. are done, or have ^^ 

boiled three hours, take out the bacon, scrape the shell clean, 
and strain the liquor — about one quart of which must be put 
back in the pot ; reserve the rest of the soup ; pick out the 
chitterlings, and cut them in small pieces ; select all the 
nice bits that were strained out, and put them with the chit- 
terlings in the gravy; add the £inn, cut in pieces* to th#m.

knd oQOUgli of tlie tiesh to fit! the upper shell ; add io it. If 
a large turtle, one bottle of white" wine, cayenne pepper, 
and salt, to your taste ; one gill of nnishroom cateup, one 

fill of lemon pickle, maco, cloves, and nutmeg, pdRded, to 
ighly season it ; mix two spoonfuls of flour with one pound 
and ci quarter of butlr; adJ, with it, n.a?Jor:i!n, thyme, 
parsloy, iiul savory, tied in a bunch ; stew all these to- 
gether till the flesh and fins are tender ; wash out the top 
shell ; place a high paste round the brim ; sprinkle over 
the shell salt and pepper, then take the herbs out of the 
stew ; if the gravy is not sufliciently thick, add a little more 
flour, and fill the shell. If no eggs^ in the turtle, boil six 
new laid ones for ten minutes ; put them in cold water a 
few minutes ; peel them ; cut them in two, and place thena 
on the turtle. Make a rich force meat; fry the balls nicely, 
and place them also in the shell. Place the shell in a drip- 
ping pan, with something underneath the sides to steady it ; 
neat the oven as for bread, and bake till a fine brown. Fry 
the liver, and send it hot. 

90. Turtle Soup. 

Put on, at an early hour in the morning, eight pounds of 
coarse beef, some bacon, onions, pepper, salt, and sweet 
herbs ; make a rich soup ; strain, and thicken it with butter 
and brown flour ; add to it the liquor left of the boiled bot- 
tom shell ; season it very high Mrith wine, spice, cayenne, 
and catsup ; put in the reserved flesh ; if not enough, add 
the choicest parts of a well boiled calf's head — do not use 
the eyes or tongue ; let boil till tender, and serve it up with 
force meat balls in it. 

Curry powder will give a higher flavor to both turtle and 
soup tiian spice. 

Should you not wish soup, the remaining flesh may be 
fried and served with a rich gravy. 

91. Moek Turtle of Calf's Head. 

Take a nicely cleaned head ; separate the Bpper from the 
lower part ; take out the brains ; boil, till tender, the other 
parts ; take them out of the water, and put into the water, 



sufficient to corer tbem, a knuckle of veal', or four ponndt 
of lean beef, Uiree cbopped onions, parsley, thyme, a tea^ 
i^MX>nfaL (^ pounded cloTes, a teaspoonful of mace, and of 
^t, anPcayenne pepper to the taste ; boil all together till 
reduced to a pint of liquor; strain it; add two gUls of red 
wine, one of mushroom, and one of walnut catsup ; thickea 
it with brown flour and butter. Stew a few minutes, in the 
gravy, the head and tongue cut in small pieces. Put a 
paste round the edge of a deep dish, three folds, one on the 
other, but none on the bottom of the dish ; place the meat 
and turn in the gravy, and bake till the paste is done. 
Pick out all the strings from the brains ; pound them ; add 
salt, pepper, and grated bread, and make them mto little 
cakes with the yolk of an egg ; fry them a nice brown* 
Boil hard six eggs ; leave one whole ; halve the five, and 
have some pieces of paste neatly baked. After the head 
is drawn from the oven, place the whole egg in the middle, 
and the pieces of paste, Uie brain cakes, and the other eggs, 
tastily around it. 

If it be intended as a soup, do not so much reduce the 
gravy ; but, after ^tewiug the head, serve it in a tureen, 
with the brain cakes and some force meat balls fried, in« 
stead of the eggs. 

Instead of a knuckle of veal, or four pounds of beef, dif- 
ferent quantities may be taken, and such other variations 
made as may best please different tastes. 



92. Plain Mock Turtle Soup, 

Boil a calf's head till very tender ; strain the liquor, on 
taking out the head ; let it stand till next day ; skim the 
fat off; cut the meat up, with the lights, and put both into 
the liquor ; place that over the fire, seasoning with pepper, ^ 
salt, mace, ai^d cloves, sweet h^bs and onions if liked ; 
stew slowly thirty minutes ; add a tumbler of white wine 
just before taking up. Chop a little salt pork, with lean 
veal, fine, adding the brains, seasoned with pepper, salt, 
mace, cloves, sweet herbs or curry powder ; make all into 
balls of the size of the yolk of an egg ; boil part in the 
soup ; fry the others for a separate dish. 



M toups^ 



93. Calfs Feet Twde Soup, 

Boil four calif's feet in two quarts of water, tiH vgry ten* 
der ; take the meat from the bones ; strain the liqm* ; add 
a pint of good beef gravy, and two glasses of wine ; season 
with hard eggs, balls, <S&c, as for the two last. 

94. Oldster Soup. 

Take the oysters out of the liquor ; to every quart of 
liquor add a pint of water or of milk ; then aet it on the fire 
with the oysters. Mix a large spooniful of iiour with a little 
water, and stir it into the liquor as soon as it boils. Sea- 
son it with pepper, salt, and a little butternut or walnut 
vinegar, or common vinegar ; add a small piece of butter ; 
and, as soon as it boils up again, pour it on to buttered toast, 
cut in small pieces. 

95. Cream Soup, 

Take a nice knuckle of veal, or two or three shanks ; 
boil about four hours, with some pepper-corns, two onions, 
salt, a little mace, and a small bit at lean ham : strain it, 
and when cold remove all the fat and sediment ; beat six 
yolks of eggs and mix them with a pint of good cream ; 
then turn the boiling soup upon it by degrees, stirring it 
well, and add the best part of the gristles to it if liked. 

Always boil cream before patting it in sauce or soup, 

96. Pea Soup, 

Put on a quart of peas in a gallon of water, with a ham 
bone, roast beef or mutton bones, four onions, and two heads 
of celery ; boil till sufficiently soft, then strain the pea pulp 
through a sieve ; return it into the pot, with salt and pep- 
per, and boil from forty to sixty minutes. A handful or two 
of spinach, washed and cut a little, added when the soup is 
strained, improves it much ; or, in place of the spinach, 
if a few young green peas can be gotten, the better. A 
teaspoonful of celery seed, or essence of celery may be 
substituted. 



S0UP9. 



97 . Veal S&up, 

Skin lixnit four pounds of a knuckle of real ; break and 
cut it into small pieces ; put it into a stew pan, with eight 
quarts of water ; skim it when it boils ; and reduce it to two 
quarts by simmering ; strain, and season it with salt, pep- 
per, a little mace, half a spoonful of lemon juice, and thicken 
with a spoonful of flour mixed with an ounce of butter, or a 
little rice. 

98. Blacky or Beef Soup. 

For soup the shank of beef is the best joint. Cold beef 
steak, and cold roast beef bones, make good soup. Boil 
the shank, in sufficient water to cover it, about five hours. 
Thirty minutes before putting the soup on the table, take 
out the meat, thicken the broth with scorched flour mixed 
with cold water ; season it with pepper, salt, mace, and 
cloves ; a little walnut or tomato catsup improves it. Add 
sweet herbs, or herb spirit, if liked. Some boil onions in 
the soup; but as they are offensive to many people, it is 
best to boil and serve them up by themselves. Make force 
meat balls of part of the beef and a little fat salt pork, chop- 
ped very fine, seasoned with salt, pepper, mace, and cloves, 
and boil them fifteen minutes in the soup. 

99. BouUli Soup. 

Select about eight pounds of the choicest part of a thick 
brisket of beef; lay it in a pot ; sprinkle over it three-quar- 
ters of a spoonful of black pepper, two spoonfuls of salt, 
three onions chopped small, six small carrots scraped and 
cut up, and two small turnips pared and cut into dice ; turn 
on three quarts of water ; cover the pot close, and keep it 
steadily and moderately boiling five hours, or till the soup 
is reduced to three pints. Take off the scum carefully, as 
it rises, and do not let the pot boil over. When the pot has 
boiled four hours, put in a small bundle of parsley and 
thyme, and a pint of celery cut small, or a teaspoonful of 
pounded celery seed. If boiled too long, these latter ingre- 
dients will lose their delicate flavor. Just before taking up 
your soup, brown it in thef following manner : put tlure^ 
3* 



quarters of a spoonful of best brown sugar into an iroA 
skillet, place it on the fire and stir it till it melts and looks 
Tory dark ; pour into it a ladle full of the soup, little at a 
time, stirring it all the while ; strain this browning'and mix 
it well with the soup, first- taking out the meat, and the 
thyme and parsley. Cover up the soup and place it near 
the fire, that it may keep hot while you prepare the bouillL 

Take the skin off the beef; dip a feather in the well- 
beaten yolk of an egg and wash the top of your beef; strew 
over it the finely grated crumbs of stale bread ; put it in a 
previously heated Dutch oven ; place the top on, with coals 
enough to brown, but not enough to bum the beef; let it 
stand nearly an hour, and prepare your gravy thus : — Take 
a sufficient quantity of soup and the vegetables boiled in it ; 
add to it a spoonful of red wine, and two of mushroom cat^ 
sup ; thicken with a little piece of butter, and a little browa 
flour ; make it v€ry hot ; pour it in your dish, and place the 
beef on it. Garnish it with green pickles. Serve up the 
soup in a tureen, with bits of toasted bread. 

N. B. If you prefer this mode of making soup, to the 
one given for black soup, you have only to take the $hin in 
place of the brisketj and make it hke this till you come to 
the bouilli ; then, instead of following the remainder of this 
receipt, put the nicest pieces of the shin beef in your 
tureen, and pour on the soup and vegetables ; adding some 
toasted bread cut in dice : then serve it out. 



100. Portable Soup. 

Let veal or beef soup get quite cold, then skim off every 
particle of the fat ; boil it till of a thick glutinous consis- 
tence. Care should be taken not to have the soup burn. 
Season it very highly with pepper, salt, cloves, and mace ; 
add a little brandy or wine, and pour it over earthen plat- 
ters not more than a quarter of an inch in thickness. Let 
it be till cold, then cut it in three-inch square pieces, set 
them in the sun to dry, often turning them« When very 
dry, place them in a tin or earthen vessel, having a layer 
of white paper between each layer of cakes. These, if the 
directions are faithfully attended to, will keep good for s 
long time. Whenever you wish to make a soup of them, 



yonhste only to put a quart of water to one of the cakeSi 
and to make the water pipings 

101. Soup Iterb Spirit 

Such as like a variety of herb spicery in soup, will find 
it convenient to have the following mixture : — When in 
their prime, take sweet .marjoram, sweet basil, thyme, and 
summer satory ; dry them thoroughly ; pound and sift them ; 
Bteep them two weeks in Inrandy. The spirit is then fit 
for use« 

102. Scotch Barley Brotki-^A Cheap and Suhstantixd Dish* 

Wask three-quarters of a pound of Scotch barley in cold 
watery put it in a pot with abolit ten pounds of shin beef 
sawed into four pieces ; cover it well with cold water, and 
set it on the fire ; when it boils, skim it thoroughly, and put 
in two or three onions ; set it near the fire to simmer very 
gently abcmt two hours ; then skim all the fat off, and put 
in two heads of celery, and a good sized turnip cut into 
small squares ; season it with salt, and let it boil an hour 
and a half longer. Take out the meat carefully with a 
slice, and cover it up by the fire to keep warm ; skim the 
broth well and put it in the tureen. 

103. Gravies and Sauces ^ 

A great deal of the elegance of cookery depends updn 
the accompaniments to each dish being appropriate and well 
adapted to it. " 

Thfe French u«ft a far greater variety of gravies and 
sauces than the Euglish or the Americans, who imitate the 
English manner of cooking. Nearly all kinds of meat give 
sufficient gravy of their own ; and we should have the pe- 
culiar flavor of each, if we cooked to perfection. The 
French know this ; and their gravies are both better and 
cheaper than ours. Thus, melted butter, which is now file 
principal gravy for meats, is unnecessarily wasted, to say 
nothing of its injurious effects. The skirts of beef, the kid- 
ney, and the milt, all make excellent gravies ; the shanks 
of mutton too ; and prepared the same as the following : 



6S H&AVIJBS ani> saoom. 



104. Brown Gravf 

Slice four pounds of lean beef; rub the bottom of the pot 
with butter, and put iu the meat ; turn it often till well 
browned) and do it moderately ^ then add four quarts of c()|^ 
water. After boiling two hours, put in a spoonful of Jp4^ 
per-coms, one carrot, and three onions; stew gently four 
hours longer ; strain it^ and when required for use, skim 
off the fat. 

1 05. To Draw, or Melt Butter. 

Nothing is more simple, in the doing, yet nothing done so 
badly. Keep a quart tin sauce pan,, with a cover to it, ex- 
clusiyely for this use. Take four ounces of good butter ; 
rub into it two teaspoonfuls of flour ; put it in the sauce 
pan, with one spoonful of water and a. little salt; cover it, 
and set the sauce pan in a larger one of boiling water ; 
shake it continually until entirely melted and beginning to 
^oiL If the pan containing the butter be placed on coals, 
the heat will reduce the bufter to oil, and so spoil the but- 
ter. This quantity is enough for one sauceboat. 

A great variety of savory sauces may be made by adding 
different herbs to drawn butter, all of which are fine to eat 
with boiled butcher's meat, fish, or fowl. 

Take parsley ; wash a large bunch very clean; pick the 
leaves from the stems carefully ; boil them ten minutes in 
salt and water ; drain them perfectly dry ; mince them ex- 
ceedingly fine, and stir them in the butter when it begins to 
draw. 

When herbs are to be added to the butter, you must take 
two spoonfuls of water instead of one for the preparation. 

Chervil, burnet, tarragon, young fennel, and cress or 
peppergrass, may all be used ; and they must be prepared 
in the same mode as the parsley. 



106. BunU Butter, for Fish, Eggs, or Salad. 

Put two ounces of butter into a frying pan ; set on the 
fire ; when of a dark brown color, put in six spoonfuls of 
vinegar, a little pepper, and salt. 



GRAVIES AND SAtTCBS* 50 



107 Drawn Bvtter, Curry Sauce^ and Egg Sauce, 

Always use sweet butter ; if at all hurt, the batter is more 
than lost : it spoils the gravy, aad every thing it is intended 
to season. 

Mix two or three teaspoonfuls of flour with a little cold 
water ; stir it till clear of lumps ; thin it, and pour on half a 
pint of boiling water, stirring it constantly ; boil it two or 
three minutes ; then cut up foui* ounces of butter into bits ; 
add it to the flour and water, and place it where it will 
melt. It will be free of lumps if properly mixed. ^ Strain 
it before it is carried to the table, if not so. 

If the butter is wanted for fish, cut into it several soft 
boiled eggs. 

If you want curry sauce, sprinkle in curry powder. 

108. Roast Meat Gravy, and Dark Gravy. 

Put a pint of water into your dripping pan, when you put" 
down your meat to roast ; just before the meat is done, stir 
up the drippings ; pour them into a skillet, and put them 
where they will boil. Smoothly mix two or three tea- 
spoonfuls of flour with a little water, and stir them into the 
gravy when it boils. 

The gravy for veal and lamb, requires a little butter ; for 
pork and geese, a little of the dressing and sage mixed 
with it 

If you wish your gravy to look dark, scorch the flour 
you thicken with : — put it in a pan, place it on a few coals ; 
stir it continually, till a dark brown. , Do not burn it. 
Suflicient may be browned at once for long use. 

109. Sauce for Cold Meat, Salad, or Fish, 

Boil two eggs three minutes ; mix with them a mustard- 
spoonful of prepared mustard, a little pepper, salt, six spoon- 
fuls of drawn butter, or salad oil, six of vinegar, and one of 
catsup. 

110. Wine Sauce for Venison or Mutton. 

Warm two gills of the liquor the meat was boiled in, or 
of the drippings ; mix two teaspoonfuls of scorched flour 



00 CAAVIfiS AND SAVCBS. 

with a little water, and stir it in when the gravy boils ; «ea- 
Bou it with cloves, salt, and pepper ; istir in a spoonful of 
warm jelly ; and, just before taJung from the fire, a gill of 
wine. For venison or mutton sauce, many prefer melted 
currant jelly. 

111. Oyster Sauce, 

To a pint of oyster liquor, put a little salt and pepper, 
and two blades of mace, (some add lemon juice ;) place it 
on the fire; on boiling, stir in two teaspoonfuls of flour 
mixed with a little milk ; after boiling a few minutes, stir 
in half a pint of oysters, and a hen's egg size piece of but- 
ter ; as soon as scalded through, take them up. 

113. Savoy JeUy far Cold Meat. 

\ Boil lean veal, or beef, till tender. If you have veal or 

beef bones, break and boil them with it — they will require 
«Jonger boiling. Boil, too, a little salt pork, sweet herbs, 
salt, and pepper. When auiiiciently boiled, take it ofiT; 
strain, and let it stand till next day ; skim off the fat ; take 
out the jelly ; and scrape off the dregs that stick to the bot- 
tom ; put in the whites and shells of several eggs, some 

* Uades of mace, a little wine, and lemon juice ; place all on 

the fire ; stir it well till it boils ; strain it through a jelly- 
bag till it is clear. ^ 

113. White Celery Sauce for Boiled Poultry. 

Take six heads of celery ; cut off the green tops ; slice 
the remainder into small bits, and boil in half a pint of wa- 
ter, till tender ; mix three teaspoonfuls of flour, smoothly, 
with a little milk ; add six spoonfuls px^re of milk ; stir it 
in ; add a little salt, and a small piece of butter ; on boiling 
take it up. Some use as a substitute for part, an egg yolk, 
with a spoonful of cream, and chopped parsley and lemon 
juice. 

p 114. Caper Sauce. 

' Is made by adding a spoonful or two of capers to drawn 

butter — many add, too, a little of the liquor. Nasturtions 
pickled, or green pickles, minced and put with the butter, 
make a very good substitute for capers. 



OA^VIfiS AK0 aAVCBH. U 



115. Lobster Sauoe. 

Boil two eggs three minutes ; mix with them a teaspoon- 
fill of water and the spawn of the lobster ; rub smooth and 
^tir in a teaspoonful of mustard, six spoonfuls of drawn 
butter or salad oil, a little pepper and salt, and five spoon- 
fuls of vinegar. Or, boil a little mace and whole pepper 
long enough to extract their strength ; strain, and melt in it 
three-quarters of a pound of butter. Cut the lobster in very 
^mall pieces, and stew in it till tender. 

116. Tomato Sauce, 

Peel and slice twelve tomatoes ; pick out the seeds ; add 
three pounded crackers, salt, and pepper; stew about 
twenty minutes. 

117. Gravy Sauce. 

Beef of good quality, and roasted with care, affords the 
be^t sauce for the meat. Free it of the sediment and fat i 
add a little salt, and, if not thick enough, a mite of browned 
flour, and boil it up. A little butter may be added to the 
veal gravy. 

* 118. Common Sauce. 

Plain butter, drawn or melted thick, with a spoonful of 
walnut pickle, or catsup, makes a very good sauce. But 
you may multiply additions according to variety of tastes. 

119. Parsley and Butter. 

Is made by adding parsley that has been chopped fme, 
after boiling a few minutes, to drawn butter. 

120. Pudding Sauce. 

Stir to a cream a teacup of butter, with two of brown 
sugar ; add a glass of wine or cider ; flavor it with rose- 
water, essence of lemon, or nutmeg. If you would have it 
liquid, heat about three gills of water boiling hot ; mix three 
teaspoonfuls of flour with a little water, and stir it into the 
boiling water ; stir this into the butter and sugar, as sooa 
as it boils ixp weU« 



63 GRAVIES AND SAUCM. 



121. Crartberr^ and Apple Sauce, 

To stew cranberries till soft, is all that is necessary to 
make cranberry sauce. When soft, stir in sagar atid mo- 
lasses to sweeten it. ^ Scald the sugar in the sauce a few 
minutes. Strain if you please — 'tis good without. 

Apples should be pared and quartered. If tart, you may 
stew them in water ; if not, in cider. After stewed soft, 
add a small piece of butter, and sweeten to the taste. 

Another very good way is, to boil the apples without 
paring, with a few quinces and molasses, in new cider, till 
reduced one half. Strain the sauce when cool. Made 
thus, the sauce will keep good for months... 

122. Chicken Salad, 

Boil a chicken that does not exceed in weight a poimd 
and a half. When quite tender, take it up, cut it in small 
strips, and prepare the following sauce and pour on it : — 
^oil four eggs three minutes ; take them out of the shells ; 
mash, and mix them with two spoonfuls of drawn butter, 
twelve of vinegar, a teaspoonful of mixed mustard, the same 
of salt, a little pepper, and essence of celery. 



123. Sauce far Turtle or Calf^s Head. 

To four gills of hot drawn butter, or beef gravy, put a 
little sage, basil, or sweet marjoram, the juice and grated 
rind of half a lemon, a little cayenne or black pepper, and 
salt ; add a glass of white wine just before you take it iq>. 

124. Mushroom Catsup, 

Lay fresh mushrooms in a deep dish ; strew a little salt 
over them ; then add another layer of fresh mushrooms, and 
salt : and so on till you get in all the mushrooms. Let them 
lay some days ; mash them line ; and to each^art put a 
spoonful of vinegar, half a teaspoonful of pepper, and quar- 
ter of a teaspoonful of cloves. Pour it into a stone jar ; set 
the jar into a pot of boiling water ; let it boil two hours ; 
then strain it without pressing the mushrooms. Boil the 
juice fifteen minutes ; skim well ; let it stand a few hours to 



waaiv 



(HUVIBS i^t> SAtJCKS M 

scittle ; then pour it off carefully through a sieve ; botde, and 
cork it close. Place it where cool. 



135. Celery Vinegar. 

Take two gills of celery seed ; pound and put it in a bot- 
tle, and fill it with sharp vinegar ; shake it every day, for 
two weeks ; then strain it, and keep it for use. It will im- 
part an agreeable celery flavor to every thing with which 
it is used. 

A delicious flavor of thyme may be obtained, if gathered 
when in full perfection* It should be picked from the 
stalks, a large handful of it put into a jar, and a quart of 
vinegar or brandy turned on it ; cover it very close. Next 
day) take all the thyme out, and put in as much more. Do 
this a third time ; then strain, bottle, and seal the cork. 
This is far preferable to dried thyme. Mint may be pre- 
pared in a similar manner. The flavor of both these kinds 
of herbs must be preserv^. by care in the preparation. If 
permitted to remain more than twenty hours in the liquid^ 
they will impart an unsavory taste. 

126. Sauce for Cod*s Head. 

Take a lobster ; stick a skewer in the vent of the tail, to 
keep the water out ; throw a handful of salt into the water ; 
when it boils, put in the lobster, and boil it half an hour ; 
pick oflf the spawns, if any, and pound them very fine, in a 
marble mortar, and put them into half a pound of drawn 
butter ; tiake the meat out of the lobster^ pull it in bits, and 
put it in your butter ; add a spoonful of lemon pickle, a 
spoonful of walnut catsup, a slice of lemon, a slice or two 
of horse radish, a little pounded mace, and salt and cay- 
enne to your taste ; boil them one minute ; then take out the 
lemon and horse radish, and serve it up in your sauceboat 

127. Fish Sauce of Liver. 

Boil the liver of the fish ; mash it fine ; stir it into drawn 
butter ; put in a little black pepper, or cayenne, two tea- 
^poonfbls of lemon juice and a spoonful of catsup. 



\ 



128. Gravy for Dueks. 

Boil all the giblets but the liver,. one hour^ in a pint ot 
water, with a chopped onion, some salt, and pepper ; strain, 
and add a very little browning, and a teaspoonM or two 
of mushroom catsup. 

. 12^. Duck Sauce. 

Boil eight or ten large onions ; change the water two or 
three times while they are boiling; when done, chop them 
on a board, to have them retain a good color ; put them in 
a sauce pan with four ounces of butter and two spoonfuls 
of good cream ; boil it a little, and turn it over the ducks. 

130. Brown Sauce for Poultry. 

Sli*e two or three onions, after they are peeled ; sprinkle 
them with flour, and fry them J^rown, in a little butter ; 
sprinkle in a little flour, salt, pepper, and sage ; add half a 
pint of the liquof the fowl was boiled in, and a spoonful of 
catsup ; if Hked, when it boils up, stir in half a whieglass 
of wine. 

131. Boiled Eggs* 

Put eggs into boiling water ; if you like the white just 
set, boil about two minutes ; if you like the yolk set^ boil 
three ; if for a salad, boil ten minutes. Boil a new-laid egg 
half a minute longer than a stale one. Another mode, 
which is very nice for fish, is to break the shells, and drop 
the eggs into a pan of scalding water ; let the pan stand till 
the while has set ; then j^ace it on a moderate fire ; when 
the water boils up the eggs are done. Eggs look very- 
pretty done in this way, the yolk being just visible through 
the white. Serve them up with burnt butter, if not wanted 
for a garnish. '.'- 

132. Poached Eggs. 

Break the eggs into a pan, (it is a good precaution, in 
case of a bad egg, to break each separately into a teacup;) 
then put them into a buttered tin pan ; place the pan on a 
few coals ; put in a small piece of buuer^ and a little salt ; 



mm^mi^^mmmm^mmmm^mmmimmmmmmm 



let ttieni cook rery moderately, stining them contmually 
till they become qtdte thick, then turn them on to spread 
toast. 

133. Omelet. 
To twelve eggs, beaten to a froth, put three ounces of 
finely minced boiled ham, beef, or veal ; (if veal, add a little 
salt ;) melt four ounces of butter to a lukewarm temperature, 
and mix a little of it with the eggs ; pijt the remainder of 
the butter on the fire iii a frying pan, or un ; when quite hot, 
turn in the beaten eggs, and stir till they begin to set. When 
brown on the under side it is sufficiently done. It should 
be cooked on a moderate fire, and in a pan so small as to 
have the omelet about an inch thick. When you take up 
the omelet, place a flat dish over the top, and turn your pan 
upside down. 

134. Egg Balls. 

Boil four eggs ten minutes ; when they are quite cold, 
put the- yolks into a mortar, with the yolk of a raw egg, a 
teaspoon ful of flour, some chopped parsley, a little salt, a 
Kttle black pepper or cayenne ; rub them well together, an4 
roll them into small balls, and boil them two minutes. 

135. FisL 

" Fifihis a dish which is almost more attended to than 
any ^ther,''^ -^attention from the time of its being caught to 
the time of serving out. It is easier of digestion than meats, 
with the exception of salmon. 

Small trout are the most delicate for invalids. Lake fish 
are also excellent. All kinds of fresh water fish are health- 
ful, if cooked immediately ailer being taken. But the ocean 
is^ the chief dependence of our fish markets. It would be 
better for the health of those who do not labor, if they would 
use more fish, and less flesh, for food. With the exception 
of salmon and lobsters, there is little danger, in our country, 
of this kind of aliment being eaten to excess. 

Flesh is much more nutritious than fish. As restorative 
food, shell-fish have long held a distinguished rank ; but 
beef, or a well dressed chop, is much better to recruit the 
strength and spirits. 

The wise and benevolent arrangements of Providenct 



60 FtSIK 

80601 to have designed that the products. of different cli«> 
mates should he most freely used, where ipost liberally 
provided. 

The climate of the Greenlander requires oil and the fat- 
test substances, to sustain the human constitution ; no con- 
diment, nor scarcely a vegetable is required. In warm cli- 
mates, pepper and other spices are produced, and, no doubt, 
required, where the diet is chiefly vegetable, or meats newly 
killed ; and the stovach and system are relaxed by the heat. 
In our own climate, the season of the year, as well as the 
age and constitution of the individual, must h€ taken into 
the account. During the cold weather, more fat meats, and 
richer gravies, may be eaten, but few or no condiments, 
except a little salt, are needed. In summer^ fish, and a 
large proportion of vegetable diet, should be used. Sauces 
made with ^cream and eggs, may be used ; and, if not too 
freely, doubtless, condiments will also be advantageous. 

Sometimes there is a muddy smell and taste attached to 
fresh water fish, which may be remedied by soaking them, 
after they have been thoroughly cleaned, in strong salt and 
water. Care should be taken that the fish be ^oroughly^ 
cleaned before dressed ; but not washed beyond what is 
necessary for the cleaning — by too much watering the fla- 
vor is diminished. Great care and punctuality are also 
necessary in cooking fish. They should be eaten as soon 
as done. If not suflSiciently done, or if too much done, they 
are not good. They are the best the day after they are 
caught, except turbot, cod, cfec, for boiling or frying. They 
should be cleansed when first caught, well rinsed in cold 
water, and salt freely sprinkled over their inside. Sprinkle 
pepper, if they are to be broiled, and place them where 
cool. When dished, the liver, roe, and chitterlings, should 
be placed so that the carver may observe them, and invite 
the guests to partake of them. 

136. To BoU Fish. 

To boil fresh fish, lay it on a strainer, or sew up the fish 
ui a cloth, as it will otherwise be difficult to take it out of 
l^e pot without breaking. Put the fish in cold water, with 
the skin side down ; if put into boiling water, the outside 
fttts.oooked too much, and breaks ta pieces before the in- 



^mi^^^^^^^mm^mmf^mmtK 



side is done. To ten pounds of fish add six spoonfuls of 
salt ; and a little vinegar should be put into the water to 
impart firmness. Boil the fish till you can easily draw out 
one of the fins — ^from fifteen to thirty minutes. Boiled fish 
should be served up with drawn butter or liver sauce. 

137. ToBraUFish, 

When fish is broiled, the bars of the <gridiron should be 
rubbed over with a little butter. Then place your fish, skin 
side down— ^own, no mistake, and do not turn it till nearly 
done through. Save all your butter till the fish is dished — 
in this way you save the juices of the fish too. Fish should 
be broiled slowly. When put on the platter, fish should 
not be laid over each other, if it can be avoided. The top 
ones will be made tender and moist by the steam, and will 
break to pieces. 

138. To Fry Fish, 

Fat from salt pork is best ; there should be enough to 
cover the fish, and hot and skimmed when the fish are laid 
in. After being cleaned and washed, fish for frying should 
be put into a cloth, to have it absorb the moisture ; make it 
quite dry, and rub a little flour over it, but no salt, if you 
wish to have it brown well. For six pounds of fish, fry 
four slices of salt pork ; when brown, take them up, and if 
they do not make enough fat to fry the fish in, put in a little 
lard. When fried enough, take them up; and for good 
plain gravy, j2)ix two or three teaspoonfuls of flour with a 
little water, and stir into the fat the fish was fried in ; put 
in a little butter, salt, and pepper ; if you wish to have the 
gravy rich, add wine, catsup, and spices. Turn the gravy 
over the fish. 

139. To Fry Fresh Cod, Trout, and Perch. 

Prepare the fish according to receipt 1 38 ; slice the cod 
into pieces half or three-quarters of an inch thick ; rub them 
in Indian meal, to prevent breaking ; fry thoroughly. 

Perch and trout are fried in the same* way, except, in- 
stead of rubbing in Indian meal, sprinkle with flour, or dip 
in the white of an egg and bread crumbs. 



M wiwm* 



140. To Braa a Skad. 

Clean, wash, and split the shad, and wipe it dry ; sprin- 
kle it with pepper and salt, place it over a very clear, slow 
fire, with the skin side down, so as to retain the juices, on 
a clean gridiron rubbed with lard ; turn it, when nearly 
done ; take up, and season Mrith a generous piece of butter, 
salt and pepper, A smoke of corn cobs while it is broiling, 
improves it much 

141 . To Roast a Shad. 

Fill the inside with good force meat ; sew it up ; tie it 
on a suitable board, (not pine ;) cover it with bread crumbs, 
a little salt, and pepper, and place it before the &re ; when 
done one side, turn it ; and when sufficiently done, pull out 
the thread ; dish it ; and serve it out with drawn butter and 
parsley. 

142. To Bake a Shad. 

Nicely prepare a large fat fish ; put some force meat in the 
inside ; lay it full length in a pan, with a pint of water, a 
gill of red wine, one of mushroom catsup, a little salt, pep- 
per, vinegar, six cloves, and a few cloves of garlic ; stew 
gently, till the gravy is sufficiently reduced. Always lay 
Sie fish on a fish slice, for the convenience of dishing with- 
out breaking it. When taken up, slide it carefully into the 
dish ; thicken the gravy with butter and brown flour, and 
turn over it: 

143. To Stuff and Bake Fish. 

Soak your bread in cold water till soft, drain it, mash 
fine and mix the bread with a spoonful of drawn butter, a 
little salt, and pepper, (two raw eggs make the dressing cut 
smoother,) and $ome spices, if liked. Fill, and sew up the 
fish ; put a teacup of water in your bake pan, and a little 
butter, place in the fish, and bake about forty or fifty min- 
utes. Bas;^, shad, and fresh cod, are good fish for baking. 

144. Chowder. 

Fiy brown several slices of pork, cut each fish into ^v^ 
or six pieces ; flour, and place a layer of them in your pork 



FI6H. 69 

fat ; sprinkle on a little pepper and salt ; add cloves, mace, 
and sliced onions ; if liked, lay on bits of the fried pork, 
and crackers soaked in cold water. Repeat this till you put 
in all the fish ; turn on water just sufficient to cover them, 
and put on a heated bake pan lid. After stewing about 
twienty minutes, take up the fish, and mix two teaspoonfuls 
of flour with a little water, and stir it into the gravy ; add- 
ing a little pepper and butter. A tumbler of wine, catsup, 
and spices will improve it. Cod and bass make the best 
chowder. Clams and black fish tolerably good. The hard 
part of the clam should be cut off and rejected. 

145. Codfish. 

Fresh cod is good to broil, fry, or to make into a cho|r- 
der. It is rather dry for broiling. Salt cod should be -y 
soaked all night in water, with a glass of vinegar. It will ^« 
majce it like fresh fish. In the morning take it out ; put it 
in fresh water ; and place it three or four hours on a mode- 
rate fire, where it will keep warm without boiling — boiling 
hardens it ; take it up, and take ofiT the skin ; serve it out 
with drawn butter. 

146. To Boil a Cod's Head and Shoulders. 

Wash it clean ; tie it up, and dry it with a cloth ; salt 
your water well and put in a glass of vinegar ; when it 
boils, take ofl* the scum ; put in the fish, and keep it boiling 
very briskly about thirty minutes. Parboil the milt, and 
roe ; cut in thin slices, fry, and serve them. Garnish witU 
horse radish. For sauces-'-oysters, eggs, or drawn butter. 

147. To Roast Cod's Head and Shoulders. 

Prepare it as for boiling, taking out the giHs and rubbing 
over it a little salt ; then, boilitig all but enough for eating, 
take it up very carefully ; take off* the skin ; set it before a 
brisk fire ; dredge it all over with flour, and baste it well 
with butter ; when it begins to froth, strew over it some fine 
bread crumbs ; continue basting all the time to make it froth 
well. When of a fine light brown, dish it up, and garnish 
it with a lemon cut in slices, barberries, horse radish, fried 
oysters, or a few small fish fried and laid around it. Cut 



TO Tim. 

the liver and roe in slices, and lay over them a little of the 
lobster from the sauce pan, in lumps, and serve out the fish. 

148. Halikut, 

This is fine, cut in slices, for fiying and broiling, pep- 
pered and salted : the fin with the thick part, is good to boil. 

149. Black Fish. 
May be broiled, but are better boiled or fried. 

150. To Broa Herring. 

When they are to be used, take a few out of the brine , 
soak them an hour or two ; scale them nicely : pull off the 
gills, and the only entrail they have will come with them ; 
wash them clean, and hang them up to dry. When to be 
broiled, take half a sheet of white paper ; rub it over with 
butter ; put the herring in ; double the edges securely ; and 
broil without burning. 

151. Sturgeon. 

This fish is best fried, but good baked or broiled. Before 
baking it, boil fifteen minutes to extract the oily taste, put 
a quart of water into the pan for ten pounds of fish, and 
bake till it is tender. The part next to the tail is best for 
frying or baking. 

Sturgeon is good cooked thus : cut it in slices about an 
inch thick, fry some slices of pork, when brown, take them 
up, and put in the sturgeon. When well browned, take up 
and stir in a little fiour and water, mixed smoothly together. 
Season the gravy with pepper, salt, and catsup, stir in a 
little butter, and wine if liked, then put back the sturgeon, 
and let it stew a few minutes in the gravy. While the fish 
is cooking, make force meal balls of part of the sturgeon 
and salt pork ; fry and use them for a garnish. 

152. To Boil Fresh Salmon. 

This fish needs more boiling in more water than any other 
fish. It is very unhealthy unless thoroughly done. 

Make your water quite salt, boil, skim, then put in your 



FISH. 71 

salmon. Continue to skim off all tliat rises. Boil half a 
pound fifteen minutes ; lobster, egg, or drawn butter for 
sauce. . . - 

153. To Broil Fresh Salmon, 

Slice it an inch and a half thick, dry in a clean clolji, 
and sprinkle a little salt over it ; warm the bars of your grid- 
iron, and rub them with a little lard ; lay the fish on, and 
set your gridiron over a clear but not very hot fire ; when 
Hearly done, turn carefully, and do the other side. 

154. To Boil Mackerel, Trout, Perch, and Bass. 

If fresh, after cleaning it thoroughly, put into sufficient 
water to cover it, sprinkling in a little salt, (some add a 
glass of vinegar) and let it rather simmer than boil, fifteen 
or more minutes. When done, take instantly from the 
water. 

Bass, Perch and Trout are boiled in the same manner. 
Use drawn butter for boiled fish. 



155. To Broil Mackerel, Perch, Buss, or Trout. 

The same as " To Broil Shad:'— No, 140. Fine shred 
parsley may likewise be added to seasoning of both, if liked; 
dravm butter,*: is a good sauce for fish. 



(( 



156. To Boil Eels. 

Clean, cut off* the heads, and dry them ; joint them into 
suitable length pieces, or coil them on your fish plate, boil 
them in salted water ; use drawn butter and parsley for 
sauce. 

157. To Broil Eels. 

After preparing them as for boiling, rub them with the 
yolk of an egg, strew over bread crumbs, minced parsley, 
pepper, salt, and sage ; butter them well, and lay them in a 
dripping pan to broil. Sauce as for boiled eels, or to the 
taste*

158. To Bake Eels. 

Joint and lay them in a deep dish, with bits df salt poii^, 
peppered and salted ; cover with pounded rusked bread, 
and bake thirty minutes. 

159. Fish Force Meat Balls, 

Chop fine a little raw fish with a little raw salt pork, mix 
it with an egg or two raw, a few bread crumbs^ and season 
with pepper and spices, catsup, and to the taste : mould into 
small balls and fry them till nicely browned. 

160. Fish Cakes, 
Take salt cod fish, or cold fresh fish boiled, mince it fine 
with potatoes, moistened with a little milk, and a bit of but- 
ter in it, mould into biscuit sized cakes, and fry them brown 
in butter, or pork fat. 

161. Lobsters and Crabs, 

Have your water boil, put in and boil them from thirty to 
forty five minutes. Boil six spoonfuls of aalt to every four, 
pounds of fish. When cold, break the shell, take out the 
meat, be cautious to extract the blue veins, and what is called 
the lady in the lobster ; these are very unhealthy. 

Eat cold with a dressing of vinegar, mustard, sweet oil, 
salt and cayenne ; or warm them up with a little water, vine- 
gar, salt, pepper ; and add a rich gravy and grated nutmeg, 
if liked. 

Lobsters look neatly dressed thus. Select the spawn 
and red chord, mash fine and rub them through a sieve, 
a^d a little butter and salt. Cut the lobsters into squares, 
and set them with the spawn, over a moderate fire ; when 
hot, take up and garnish with parsley. The spawn and 
chord are a nice garnish for any kind of fish ; eat but little 
of the lobster. 

The same process for Crabs as forXobsters. 

162. Scollops. 

These are fine boiled, then fried; or pickled in the 
same way as oysters. Take them from the shells. Aftei 
boiling pick out the hearts and throw the rest away. The 



FISH. 73 

heart is the only part that is healthful. Flour and fry th« 
hearts till brown, in butter. They are good stewed, in a 
little pepper, salt and butter. 

163. To Roast Clams, — Svperior mode oftooHng them. 

Select according to taste as to size, (those with thin edges 
are the tenderest, /never buy. those of a thick edge,) wash 
them clean, place them ^atwise in an old tin or iron pan, so 
as to save the liquor, and set the pan over a furnace of igni- 
ted coal. As they become sufficiently roasted, take them 
out singly, empty the liquor of each into your dish, then 
take out and add the clam, either cut in pieces or whole ; 
add butter, salt, and pepper ; other seasoning to taste. 
Clams and oystets generally agree with those who like 
theni. Lobsters may form an exception. 

164. Pot Clams. 

Wash and put the clams in a pot, with merely water 
enough, to prevent their burning. Heat till they open, take 
out and warm them with a little of the liquor, butter, salt 
and pepper. To a slice or two of toasted bread, soaked in 
the clam liquor, add the clams. 

165. Clam Pancakes. 

Make a thick batter of Hour and milk ; 'clam liquor does 
not make them so light as milk ; put to each pint of milk 
two eggs and a few clams ; the c]§ms may be put in whole 
after being first stewed, or they may be only taken outt^f 
the shell and chopped fine. 

166. Long Clams. 

Select the largest, take them out of the shell, and broil 
them ; or they may be stewed ; season to the liking. 

167. To Stew Oysters. 

Rinse the bits of shell off the oysters, strain, then turn 
the liquor back, put them in a stew pan over the fire, let 



74 PUDBllSGS. . 

them boil up, then turn them on to hnttered ^oist ; butter, 
pepper and salt them. Some thicken the liquor with rolled 
cracker, and put in milk and cream ; others add a liule 
walnut catsup, or vinegar, mace, or lemoh peel. Oysters 
should be eaten hot. 

168. To Fry Oysters, 

Select the fattest of large size, dip them ia beaten eggs, 
then in flour, or fine bread crumbs ; fry them in lard till of 
a light brown. They are a fine garnish for calves' head, 
fish, or most modem dishes. 

169. Oyster Pancakes, 

Mix together equal measures of oyster liquor and milk, 
to a pint of this mixture, put a pint of wheat flour, a few 
oysters, two eggs, and a little salt ; drop by spoonfuls into 
hot lard, and fry till of a nice brown, 

170. Oyster Pie. 

Line a deep dish Math pie-crust, fill with dry pieces of 
]»read, and cover it with puff paste, bake either in a bake 
pan or quick oven till it is a light brown ; by this time have 
the oysters just stewed, take off the upper crust, take out the 
pieces of bread, put in the oysters, season with salt, pepper, 
and butter ; walnut catsup : replace the upper crust. 

171. Scolloped Oysters, 

Pound fine, rusked oread or crackers, butter 'scoll<^ 
shells or tins, sprinkle on the bread stuff, put in a layer of 
oysters, a bit of butter, salt, pepper, and a little of the oyster 
liquor ; add another layer of crumbs, and oysters, and so on 
till the shells are filled, placing a layer of the bread stuff 
on the top, bake them till of a light brown in a Dutch oven. 

172. Puddings, 

Be particular to always wash the salt from butter, where 

sugar constitutes one ingredient of any compound ; or where 

> drawn butter is to be used to butter any mould for baking ; — 



■^^ 



if Qot, the article baked will have an unsavory salt taste on 
its outside. 

Stone and V cut in two your raisins ; sift a little flour over 
them, stir them in the dour and take them out free from 
lumps — ^the flour which adheres to them will prevent their 
uniting, or settling to the bottom in a mass. Or when you 
bake puddings, by waiting till the pudding begins to thicken 
in the oven, before you add the fruit, the fruit will not sink. 

Use fresh eggs — stale eggs will not beat well. Always 
separate the yolks from the whites ; when they are to be 
mixed with milk, let the milk cool after boiling, or the eggs 
will poach ; and set the milk on the fire only a few minutes, 
to take out the raw taste of the egg, stirring it continually. 

Wash your currants in several waters, till perfectly clean. 
Pick over and dry them well ; or they will adhere. 

Put your almonds in, hot water, till you can blanch, or 
skin them ; always pound them widi orange or rose water, 
to prevent their oiling. 

Put in cream*; if used, just before the mixture is ready- 
much beating will decompose it. 

Before a pudding or cake is begun, (for the above direc- 
tions will apply as well to cake as to puddings) have every 
ingredient ready. The article is injured when the process 
is retarded by neglect in the preparations. Have the oven 
in a proper state ; and the paste ready in the dishes or 
moulds for such things as require a paste. When but a 
single egg, or two, are to be used, cooks often think it use- 
Jfss to beat them : mistake ! unless they are made light be- 
fore used, e^gs are an. injury. It is well to mix the pudding 
an hour or two before, it is boileWar baked. 

Make your pudding bags of German sheeting : a cloth 
less thick will admit water, and deteriorate the pudding. 
Before turning in, or bagging your pudding, dip the cloth in 
water, wring it out, and flour the inside. When bagged, tie 
tight, leaving sufficient room for expansion by swelling. 
Flour and Indian puddings require much room. Put them 
in a pot of boiling water, placing an old plate on the bottom, 
to prevent the bag from sticking to it. Turn the bag over, 
after having been in the pot a few minutes, to prevent the 
pudding's settling and becoming heavy. Keep suflicient 
water in the pot to cover the pudding, and not. let the pot 



stop boiling one second — if so, the pudding will not be the 
thing. A tea-kettle of boiling water should be at hand, to 
turn in as the water boils away. When the pudding is 
done, dip the bag in «old water a moment; the pudding will 
then readily turn out. 

173. Virginia Chicken Pudding. 

Beat ten eggs perfectly light, add to them a quart of rich 

milk, four ounces of drawn butter, p^per, and salt ; stir in 

sufficient flour to make a thin batter ; then take four young 

^ chickens, clean them neatly, cut off the legs, wings &c. 

Put them all in a sauce pan, with salt and water, and a bun- 

I die of thyme and parsley ; boil them till nearly done, then 

' take but the chicken and put it in the batter, and pour the 

batter in a deep dish and bake it. White gravy for sauce. 

174. Almond Puddings ' 

Shell half a pound of sweet almonds, and pour scalding 
water over them, to make them peel. As they become cool, 
pour on more boiling water, till they are all blanched. 
Blanch also one ounce of peach meats, or bitter almonds, 
throw them into a bowl of cold water as you blanch them. 
Take them out, one by one ; wipe them dry on a clean 
towel ; lay them on a plate ; pound them singly in a marble 
mortar, till of a fine paste, adding a few drops of rose-water 
as you pound, to prevent their oiling : — Pound alternately, 
a sweet and then a bitter almond, to mix them well, aim 
see you make them perfectlji fine and smooth ; — they are 
improved by being prepslK^ day before they are wanted 
f for use. 

Stir four ounces of butter and four qunces of powdered 
white sugar to a cream, and add gra(ldally, a spoonful of 
mixed rose-water, brandy and wine, l 

Beat the whites of six eggs, till tl^y stand alone ; stir 
them and the almonds alternately into Ihe butter and sugar, 
and thoroughly mix the whole. Butter a soup plate ; have 
ready a puff paste ; (see receipt for making it) place it on 
the plate, trim and notch it ; then put in your pudding ; 
bake about half an hour, in a moderate oven ; and grate lo^f 
sugar over it

175. Rick Boiled Indian Pudding. 

Warm a pint of molasses and a pint of milk, and stir 
them well together ; beat four eggs, and strr them gradually 
into the molasses and milk, in turn with a pound of beef 
suet chopped very fine, and Indian meal sufficient to make 
a thick batter; add a teaspdonful of pulverized cinnamon 
and nutmeg, and a little gratedVIemon peel, then stir all to- 
gether very hard,^f you have too much Indian meal, the 
pudding will be heavy.

178. Plain Boiled Indian Pudding. 

Stir sufficient Indian meal into a quart of boiling milk or 
water, to form a very stiff batter ; stir in two spoonfuls of 
flour, three of sugar or molasses, half a spoonful of ginger 
or two teaspoonfuls of cinnamon, and two of salt. 

This may be made still plainer ; — or a little richer, by the 
addition of two or three eggs, and a little chopped suet. 
Boil three hours: — if six, the better— some cooks boil eight 
or nine hours. When so long, seven hours of the boiling 
skould be given the day before the pudding is to be eaten— 
this is good fried when cold.

With a narrow knife, take qut the core of pared, tart, 
mellow apples ; and fill the place of the core, with sugar ; 
roll out some good pie cmet about two thirds of an inch 
thick, and cut it into pieces of just suflicient size to roll the 
apple in. Lay an apple on each piece, and inclose it en- 
tirely, tying up in a smooth thick piece of cloth tlwit has 
been well floured. Put in a pot of boiling water, and boil 
the dumplings an hour without intermission. They will 
otherwise be hard. 

Eat them with butter and sugar, or with pudding sauce. 

217. Plain Fritters. 

Stir a quart of milk gradually into a pound of flour ; add 
seven well beaten eggs, and a tea§poonful of salt. Drop 
them by the spoonful into hot lard, and fry them of a light 
brown. They are the less greasy, fried in just suflicient 
fat to keep them from sticking to the pan, but the lighter 
fried in a great deal of fat ; serve out with liquid pudding 
sauc^.

218. Cream Fritters. 

Mix a pint and a half of flour with a pint of milk ; stir in 
six well beaten eggs ; add half a nutmeg ; then two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt, and a pitit of cream ; stir the whole just 
enough to intermix the cream, then fry in small cakes ; the 
addition of a few tender apples chopped fine improves the 
fritters. 

219. Spanish Fritters, 

Mix early in the morning a quart of flour with a well 
beaten egg, a spoonful of yeast, and milk enough to make 
it a little softer than muffin dough, adding a little salt. 
When well risen, work in two spoonfuls of drawn butter ; 
make the mixture into balls, the size of a walnut, and fry 
them till of a Hght brown, in boiling lard ; eat them with 
molasses, wine and sugar, or a sauce prepared.

up the paste, working in all the scraps on the board until 
the paste is smooth. Frcnn die remaining three pounds of 
- flour sprinkle the board and roll out the paste. Repeat this 
till 'lis quite smooth. Divide the butter into two parts. 
Flour each part. Put one part in the end of the long sheet 
of crust. Give it a roll or two ; then put in the other part, 
in the same manner, and roll up the whole like a scroll ; 
roll it till very light, turning it on the pin at each toll ; then 
fold it together like a sheet four times. When folded, cut 
into strips the width of the pie plate, and roll out thin enough 
for the pie, and roll it over the pin ; then unroll it over the 
line of plates. Wet the lotver crust, which should be thin, 
when on the plate, before filling. Then after filling, roll 
out the upper crust on hoth sides till even ; and from the 
pin, unroll, and spread over the line of plates, leaving the 
paste half an inch thick. 

The handsomest ornamental edging for pie or pudding, is 
the cutting into large squares, the edge of the crust, and 
folding over one comer of it ; the lid of the pie should be 
pricked, or a lip cut in the top. 

223. Common Paste for Pies, — No. 1» 

To make one large pie, or two small ones, take a pound 
and a half of sifted flour, and twelve ounces of washed but- 
ter. Sift the flour into a pan. Divide the butter into two 
equal parts. Cut up one half into the flour as small as pos- 
sible. Mix it thoroughly with the flour, wetting it gradu- 
ally with a little cold water. Strew some flour over your 
paste board, take the lump of paste out of the pan, flour your 
rolling pin, and roll out the paste into a large sheet, rolling 
from you. Stick the sheet over with the remaining butter 
in small pieces placed at equal distances. Sprinkle on a 
little flour, fold up the sheet, flour it lightly, and roll it out 
again. Then fold it up, cut it in two, or in four, according 
to the size of your pies. Roll it out into round sheets the 
size of your pie plates, now pressing rather harder on the 
rolling pin. i3utter your pie plates, place the under crust, 
and trim the edge. Fill the dish with wliat is to constitute 
the pie, and put on the lid, pricking some holes, or cutting 
a small slit in the top. Crimp the edges with a sharp knife.

224. Common Pastry. — No. 2; 

For a good common pie-crust, calculate half a pound of 
shortening to a poimd of flour ; or the same proportion as iu 
No. 1. If you wish a very short crust, instead of one half, 
take three quarters of the weight of shortening that you take 
of flour. 

Pie-crust looks the handsomest ipade wholly of lard, but 
it does not taste so well as to have a proportion of butter 
Beef shortening mixed with butter, makes good plain pie- 
crust, in the cold seasoh. Rub half of the shortening with 
two thirds of the flour ;jj'and to each pound of flour put a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Whrii the shortening is completely mixed 
with the flour, add just enough cold water to make it suffi- 
ciently moist to roll out easily. Divide the crust into two 
equal pcartions — ^lay one of them by for the upper crust ; roll 
out the other quite thin, flouring your rolling board and pin, 
that the crust will not stick to them, and line your pie plates, 
previously buttering them ; fill your plates with what is to 
constitute the pie ; roll out the upper crust as thin as possi-* 
ble ; spread on the reaerved shortening, or the other half, and 
sprinkle over it the other portion, or third of the flour RoU 
up your upper crust, and cut it into as many pieces as you 
liave pies to cover. Roll each one out more than half an 
inch thick, and cover the pies : trim off^ the edges neatly 
with a knife, and press down the crust ; round the edge of 
the plate with a jagging iron, to prevent the escape of the 
juices while baking. Pastry should be baked, in a quick 
oven to he nice. In cold weather, warm, but do not melt, 
the shortening. The crust will not bfe flaky if you do. 

225. Common Family Pastry,- — No. 3. 

Take one quart of sifted flour, two teacups of latd, and 
one of butter. Reserve a handful of flour, and the cup of 
butter for your upper crust. Mix the lard well with the 
flour by rubbing them together with sufficient water to mois- 
ten the mass, as before directed : Lay by one half of it 
for the upper crust ; and line the bottom of the pie plates,

226, Pvff Paste. 

To make puff paste for one soup plate pie, for four smaD 
shells ; (or for two puddings :) take ten ounces of sifled 
flour, eight ounces of best fresh butter washed, and a little 
cold water. Sift the flour through a fine hair sieve into a 
broad deep pan ; lay aside one quarter of it, on a corner 
of your paste board, to roll and sprinkle with ; after washed, 
squeeze the butter hard with your hands, and shape it into 
a round ball ; divide it into four equal parts ; lay them one 
side of your paste board, and have oh hand a glass of cold 
water. Cut one of the four pieces of butter into the pan as 
small as possible ; wet the contents Of the pan gradually, 
with a very litUe water, (too much will make it tough) and 
mix it well with the point of a large case knife ; do not touch 
it with the hand. When the dough shapes into a lump, 
sprinkle some of the flour you laid aside on the middle of 
the board, and lay the dough upon it, turning it out of the 
pan with the knife. Flour the rolling pin, and the lump of 
paste ; roll the paste out thin, quickly, and evenly, pressing 
on the rolling pin very lightly ; then take the second of the 
four pieces of butter, and with the point of your knife, stick 
in little bits at equal distances all over the sheet of paste. 
Sprinkle over some flour, and fold up the paste. Flour 
the paste board and rolling pin again ; and throw a little 
flour on the paste, and roll it out a second time. Stick the 
third piece of butter all over the sheet, in little bits. Throw 
on some flour, fold up the paste, sprinkle a little more flour 
(HI the dough, and on the rolling pin, and roll it out a third 
time, always pressing lightly. Stick it over with the fourth 
and last piece of butter. 

Throw on a little more flour, fold up the paste, and then 
roll it out in a large round sheet. Cut ofl* the sides, so as 
to make the sheet of a square form, and lay the slips of 
dough upon the square sheet. Fold it up with the small 
pieces of trimmings inside. Score and notch it a little with 
the knife ; lay it on a plate and set it away in a cool place, 
but not where it will freeze, as that will make it heav}^

Having made the paste, prepare and mix your pie or pud- 
ding. When the mixture is finished, fetch out your pastes 
flour your board and rolling pin, and roll out your {>aste 
with a short quick stroke, pressing the rolling pin rather 
harder than while you were putting the butter in. If the 
paste rises in blisters, it will be light, unless spoiled in 
baking. 

Cut the sheet in halves, fold both separately, and roll out 
each once more, in round sheets, the size of your plates^ 
pressing on rather harder, but not too hard. Roll the sheets 
thinnest in the nliddle, and thickest at the edges. If inten- 
ded for puddings, lay the sheets in buttered soup plates, and 
trim them evenly round the edges. If the edges do not ap- 
pear ithick^ enough, ta-ke the trimmings, put them all together, 
roil them out, and having cut them in slips the width of the 
rim of your plaie, lay them all round to make the p^^.te 
thicker at the edges, joining them nicely and evenjy, as 
every patch or crack will appear distinctly when baked. 
Notch the rim handsomdy with a very shai^ knife. Fill 
the dish with the mixture of the pudding,, and bake it in ft 
moderate oven. The paste should be of a light brown color. 
If the oven is too slow, it will be soft and clammy : if too 
•quick, it will not have time to rise so high as it ought. 

227. Confectioner's Pastry, 

Take five parts of flour to four of shortening ; or weigh 
out a pound and a quarte]" of flour, and a pound of butter. 
Rub one-third of the butter with two-thirds of the fioui, ad- 
ding a teaspoonful of salt. When the butter is thoroughly 
mixed with the flour, add one beaten egg, and cold water, 
to moisten enough to roll out. Sprinkle part of the reserv- 
ed flour on a board ; cut the btttter into small pieces, and 
roll out the pieces as^thin as possible. In order to roll them 
very thin, you must sprinkle a great deal of the flour on the 
moulding board and rolling pin. Lay the butter, as fast as 
rolled out, on a floured plate, each piece by itself. 

Roll out the pastry as thin as it can be rolled ; cover it 
with the rolled butter ; sprinkle on part of the reserved 
flour, and roll the crust up. Continue to roll out the crust, 
and put on the reserved butter and flour, till the whole ia

for the lining of your plates or the under crust. Puff pas* 
try should be baked in a quick oven till of a light brown, to 
be nice. If it browns before the fruit in the pie is suffi- 
ciently baked, cover it with thick papers. 

228. Tart Paste. 

Rub into eight ounces of flour, six of butter, and a spoon- 
ful of powdered sugar. Form it into a thick paste with hot

231. Tomato Pie. 

Pick green tomatoes, pour boiling water over them, and 
let them remain a few minutes ; then strip off the skin, cut 
the tomatoes in slices, and put them in deep pie plates. 
Sprinkle a little ginger and some sugar over them in several 
layers. Lemon juice, and the grated peel, improve the pie. 
Cover the pies with a thick crust, and bake them slowly 
about an hour. 

232. Mince Pie. 

Parboil a beef's heart, or tongue, or a fresh piece of beef. 
When cold, chop very tine two pounds of the lean ; chop 
as fine as possible, two pounds of the inside of beef's suet, 
and mix the meat and the suet together, adding a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Take four pounds of pippin apples, pared, cored 
and chopped fine, two pounds of raisins stoned and chop- 
ped, and two pounds of currants, picked, washed and dried, 
and mix the fruit with the suet and meat. Add two pounds 
of powdered sugar, two grated nutmegs, half an ounce of 
powdered cinnamon, a quarter of an ounce df cloves, a

white wine, a quart of brandy, and a wineglass of rose-wa- 
ter, mixing them well together. 

Make a paste, allowing for each pie eight ounces of but- 
ter and twelve ounces of sifted flour. Lay a sheet of paste 
all over a soup plate ; •fill it with mince meat, laying slips 
of citron on the top, in the proportion of half a pound for 
the entire mixture. Roll out a sheet of paste for the lid of 
the pie ; put it on, and crimp the edges with a knife ; prick 
holes in the lid, and bake half an hour in a brisk oven. 

Meat will keep good for pies, several months, if kept in 
a cool dry place, and prepared as follows. To a pound of 
meat choj^ed fine, and four ounces of suet, put an ounce 
of cinnamon, an ounce of mace, a quarter -of an ounce of 
cloves, and two teaspoonfuls of salt, add, if hked, eight oun- 
ces of currants, eight of raisins, and four of citron. Add 
too, a tumbler of brandy or wine, three spoonfuls of molas- 
ses, and sugar enough to make it quite sweet. Put all in 
a stone pot, and cover it with a paper wet in brandy. In 
using it, take equal weights of meat and apples pared and 
chopped fine. If not seasoned enough, add to the taste. 
If the apples are not tart, put in lemon juice or cider. 

. 233. Plain Mince Pie. 

Neat's tongue and feet make the best mince pies. The 
shank is good. Boil the meat till very tender, take it up, 
clean it from the bones and gristle, chop it fine, mix it with 
an equal weight of tart ^apples chopped fine.^ If the meat is 
lean, put in a little butter or suet. Moisten the whole with 
cider ; new, if you have good ; sweeten it to the taste with 
sugar and a little molasses — seasoning with salt, cinnamon, 
cloves, and mace. Make the pies on fleet plates, with 
holes in the upper crust, and bake from thirty to forty five j 

minutes. i

sins, one of good brown sugar, one of nicely chopped suet, 
one of cider, and a pint of brandy ; add a teaspoonful of 
pounded mace, of nutmeg, and of cloves ; and mix all -w^ell 
together. When pies are wanted, take as much of this 
mixture as may be necessary, adding to "each quart of it a 
teaspoonful of pepper, and one of salt ; this much improves 
the flavor, and ean be easier mixed with a little than ^th 
the whole mass. Cover the moulds with paste ; put in the 
mince meat ; cover the top with fine slips of citron ; and 
crown the whole with a lid garnished jaround with paste 
cut in fanciful shapes. Bake from thirty to forty minutes. 
They are best hot ; but may be eaten either cold or hot. 
The mince meat may be potted, and kept for use as needed 



235. Apple Pie, 

. Green apples, when small, are nice stewed whole, with 
the skins on, and strained when soft, and sweetened. When 
large enough, pare, quarter, and core the apples.' If the 
apples are not ripe, stew them with barely water enough to 
prevent their burning. Sweeten them, when soft, and sea- 
son them to the taste. Ripe apples are best for pies, not 
to be stewed. 

Line your plates with a thin paste, fill them, and cover 
them with a thick crust, and bake from thirty to forty min- 
utes. When baked enough, carefully remove the upper 
crust by loosening its edge with a broad knife and sliding 
^ it oti to a plate ; put a piece of butter of nutmeg size into 

each pie ; sweeten it to your taste ; and, if the apples are 
not sufficiently acid, squeeze in a little lemon juice ; and 
season with lemon peel, nutmeg, and rose-water. Replace 
the crust. 
. Apples quartered, without paring, and stewed soft in new 

y cider and molasses, make good plain pies. Strain the ap- 

^, pies, after stewing, and season with nutmeg and cinnamon. 

9 If made quite sweet, apples thus stewed, strained, and 

seasoned, will keep good several months. Turn boiUng 
water on to dried apples, enough to cover them, and stew 
them till quite soft ; if they are not sufficiently tart, turn in 
sour cider when they are partly done. Stew with the ap-

rice ; boil till very soft, take it from the fire, and add a quart 
of cold milk, five eggs, a niitmeg, a little salt, sugar to the 
taste, and strain it through a sieve. May add a few rai- 
sins. Bake from thirty to forty minutes, in deep plates, 
with a lining and rim of paste. 

237. Peach Pie, 

Select mellow, juicy peaches ; wash and place them in 
a deep pie plate lined with paste; strew a thick layer of su- 
gar on each of peaches, adding a spoonful of water, and a 
sprinkling of flour over the tc^ of each layer ; cover with a 
thick crust ; and bake about an hour. The prussic acid of 
the stone imparts a most agreeable flavor to the pie. Stew 
peaches that are hard, before making them into pies. Also, 
stew dried peaches soft, and sweeten them ; and give them 
no other spice than a few of the meats, blanched and 
pounded fine in a little rose-water. 

238. A Plain Custard Pie. 

Boil a quart of milk with six peach leaves or with a lem- 
on rind. When the milk is sufliciently flavored, strain, and 
place it where it will boil. Smoothly mix a spoonful of 
flour with two of milk, and stir the mixture into the boiling 
milk. Stirring it constantly, let it boil one minute. Take 
it from the fire ; put in three well-beaten eggs as soon as 
cool ; sweeten to the taste ; pour it into deep pie plates, and 
immediately bake the pies in a quick oven. 

239. Apple Custards. 

Pare, quarter, and core six mellow, tart apples ; set them, 
with six spoonfuls of water, in a pan, on a few coals ; and 
as they soften, turn them into a pudding dish, and sprinkle 
on sugar. Mix eight eggs, beaten with rolled brown sugar, 
with three pints of milk ; grate in half a nutmeg, and turn 
the whole over the apples. Bake about twenty-five minutes

243. Tart Pie. 

Cranberries, sour apples, and peaches, make good tarts. 
Stew them, and strain when soft. Add a little lemon juice

gar and lemon peel to the taste ; put a well-beaten egg ia 
each pie to make it cut smooth; and bake on shaUow 
plates, with an under crust and rim of p^atry. Ornament 
with fine strips of paste ; and when the crust is done, call 
the fie done.

A little grated lemon peel may be added. Place over the 
top a thick crust ; press it tight round the edge of the plate, 
and perforate it with a fork, that the crust may not burst 
while baking, and let the juices of the pie escape. Bake 
about one hour in a slow oven. Rhubarb pie must not be 
quick baked. Some stew rhubarb before making it into 
pies, but it is best without stewing. 

245. Punyifkin Pie, 

Halve, seed, rinse, slice into small strips, and stew the 
pumpkin over a gentle fire, in just water enough to prevent 
burning to the bottom of the pot. After stewed soft, pour off 
the water, and steam the pumpkin about eighteen minutes, 
over a slow fire, seeing that it does not burn. Take it off, 
and strain it, when cool, through a sieve. Put to a quart 
of the pumpkin, twelve eggs and two quarts of milk, if yoa 
wish the pies very rich. Put to a quart of the pumpkin, 
three eggs and one quart of milk, if you wish them plain. 
If very plain, put to a quart, one egg, with a spoonM of 
fiour, and very little milk. The more thinned the pumpkin, 
the greater the number of eggs required. Sweeten the 
pumpkin to the taste, with sugar beaten with the egg, and 
very little molasses. Lemon peel, nutmeg, and ginger, are 
good seasoning for the pies. As they require a hot oven, 
have the pumpkin scalding hot at the time of putting it into 
the plates, to prevent the rim of the pies getting burnt be- 
fore the inside is sufficiently baked. Bake as soon as the 
plates are filled, to prevent the crust becoming clammy. 
The fewer the eggs in the pies, the longer the time re- 
quked to bake them. Pumpkin may be kept several months 
in cold weather, by making it, after stewed, very sweet, 
and strong of ginger, and then scalding it well. Keep it 
in a cool place,, in a stone jaj.\ Take out what you want 
at any time, and put to it the milk and eggs.

247. Grape Pie, 

When green and tender, grapes make a good pie. Steif? 
and strain the grapes, unless very small, to separate the 
seeds, before making them into pies, and sweeten them to 
the taste. They need no spice. If made into a pie with- 
out stewing, put to each layer of grapes a spoonful of water^ 
after a thick layer of sugar. 

248« Currant and Gooseberry Pte. 

Currants and gooseberries may be used for pies, when 
ripe ; but they are best just before turning red, and of fidl 
growth. Mixed with ripe mulberries or raspberries, cur- 
rants make fine pies. As the juice of the currants is apt 
to run out while the pies are baking, and leave the fruit dry, 
and not sufficiently sweet, scald in the sugar before they 
are baked. Stew them on a moderate fire, with twelve 
spoonfuls of water to two quarts of currants ; as soon as 
they begin to crack, put in the sugar and scald it in, a few 
minutes. If baked without stewing, add a thick layer of 
sugar to each of fruit — ^four ounces of sugar to a pint of 
currants. Green currant pies are good sweetened with 
sugar and molasses mixed. 

249. Fruit Pies in Variety. 

In making pies from ripe summer fruit, raspberries, black- 
berries, damsons, cherries, Slc, always take a deep plate, 
line it with paste, place in the middle an inverted teacup, 
and fill the pl^te with fruit Brown sugar and spice to the 
taste. The cup thus placed, will receive the juice, which 
would otherwise escape at the edges of the pie. It will 
settle under the cup ; which remove on cutting the pie.

roll out, each time, from you, and to roll up towards you, 
leaving it, at least, an inch thick. Add the upper crust ; 
cut a lip in it ; and ornament it with some of the reserved 
paste, having first lightly sprinkled the chickens with fiour, 
after almost filling the dish with the liquor in which the 
chickens were stewed. Pin tight' around the rim of the 
dish a cloth bandage, to prevent the escape of the juices ; 
and bake from an hour to an hour and a half, in a quick 
oven. If the top burns, lay a paper over it. 

253. Common Chicken Pie. 

Prepare the chickens, and place them in a deep pudding m 

dish, as by preceding rule. Put three or four slices of pork " 

to each layer of chicken. Add some of the liquor in which' 
they were boiled, and two ounces of butter, in small pieces.

254. Almond Custard, No. J. 

Take ene pint of rich milk, one of cream, half a pound 
of shelled sweet almonds, two ounces of shelled bitter al- 
monds, four spoonfuls of rose-water, four ounces of white 
sugar, the yolks of eight eggs, and a little oil of lemon ; 
blanch the almonds and pound them to a paste, mixing the 
rose-water gradually wifli them ; powder the sugar, and 
beat the yolks till very light ; mix the milk and cream to- 
gether, and stir in gradually, the sugar, the pouiided al- 
monds, and the beaten yolks. Stir the whole very hard. 
Put the mixture into a skillet or sauce pan, and set it in a 
heated stove, or on a charcoal furnace. Stir it one way 
till it becomes thick, but take it off before it curdles. Set 
it away to get cold. Take half the whites o£ the eggs ; 
beat them well, adding a little pow<iered sugar, and a few 
drops of oil of lemon. Put the custard into a glass bowl 
or dish, and heap the frothed white of an egg upon it. Or- 
nament the top with nonpareils, or sugar sand. Or put the 
custard in small cups, piling some froth on ea6h. 

255. Almond Custard^ No. 2. 

Blanch, and pound fine, four ounces of almonds, with a 
spoonful of rose-water ; boil them four or five minutes in a 
quart of milk, with sugar enough to .sweeten the milk ; re- 
move it from the fire ; when lukewarm, stir in the well- 
beaten yolks of eight eggs, and the whites of four ; set all 
on the fire and stir constantly till it thickens. Then take 
it up ; stir it till partly cooled, and turn it into cups. Set 
the cups into a pan of cold water, if you wish to have the 
custards cool quick. As soon as the water gets warm 
change it. Just before the custards are to be eaten, beat 
the reserved whites of the other four eggs to a froth, and 
pile them on the top of the custards; 

256. Soft Custard, 

Take a quart of cream or milk, the yolks only of sixteen 
eggs, six ounces of powdered white sugar, half an ounce 



CtSTARBS. 101 

of cinnamon broken in small pieces, a large handful of 
peach leaves, or half an ounce of peach kernels, or bitter 
almonds, broken in pieces, a spoonful of rose-water, and a 
nutmeg ; and boil in the nulk, the cinnamon, and the peach 
kernels or leaves. When it has boiled, set it away till cold. 
Strain it through a sieve, soon as cold, to clear it of the 
cinnamon, leaves, <&;c., and stir into it gradually, the sugar, 
spice, and rose-water. Stir by degrees the sixteen yolks, 
beaten very light, into the milk, which must be quit© cold, 
or the eggs will make it curdle. Put the custards into cups, 
and set them in a baking pan half filled with water. When 
bakedj grate some nutmeg over each, and ice them. Make 
the icing of the whites of eight eggs, a heaping teaspoon- 
ful of powdered loaf sugar, and six drops of essence of 
lemon, beaten all together till it stands alone. Pile up 
some of the icing on the top of each custard. 

257. Rennet Cttstards. — See " To Make Rennet.^^ 

Take half a pint of cream and a quart of new milk mixed, 
four ounces of powdered white sugar, a large glass of white 
wine in which an inch of washed rennet has been soaked, 
and a nutmeg ; mix together, in a pitcher, the milk, cream, 
and sugar ; stir in the wine ; and pour the mixture into 
your custard cups. Set them in a warm place near the 
fire, till they become a firm curd. Then set them on ice, 
or in a cold place. Grate nutmeg over them. 

258/ Cream Custards, 

Sweeten a pint of cream with powdered white sugar, and 
set it on a few coals. When hot, mix with it white wine 
till it curdles. Add rose-water, or essence of lemon, to the 
taste, and turn it into cups. 

Another very nice way of making custards, is to mix a 
pint of milk with a pint of cream, five beaten eggs, three 
spoonfuls of sugar, and two of fiour, adding nutmeg to the 
taste, then baking in cups or in pie plates, in a quick oven. 

259. Boiled Custards, * 

Set your milk on the fire, and let it boil up. Remove ^^ 
it from the fire, and let it cool. Beat for each quart of milk«

if liked rich, the yolks and half the whites of si? eggs, with 
three spoonfula of rolled sugar. Stir them into the milk 
when cool. For very plain custards, four eggs are suffi- 
cient for a quart of milk. Season the cusiard with nutmeg 
or rose-water ; set it on a few coals ; and stir it constantly, 
till it thickens and becomes scalding hot. Remove it from 
the fire before boiling. Stir it a few minutes, and turn it 
into cups. Beat to a stiff froth the reserved whites of the 
eggs, and pile them ofl the top of the custards just before 
they lire to be eaten. 

260. Mottled Custards. 

Stir the beaten yolks of six eggs into a quart of boiling 
milk ; one minute after the yolks have set so as to be thick, 
stir in the whites well beaten, with three spoonfuls of su- 
gar, if liked very sweet. Season with rose-water, or essence 
of lemon ; stir till it becomes lumpy and thick, and then 
turn it into cups. 

261. Milk Custards. 

Make a quart of milk quite hot, that it may not whey 
when baked ; let it stand till cold ; then mix with it, eight 
eggs ; sweeten with loaf sugar, and flavor with essence of 
lemon and rose-water. Fill the custard cups ; put on the 
covers ; and set them in the oven, in a dripping pan half 
filled with boiling water. When the water has boiled ten 
or fifteen minutes, take out a cup, and if the custard is the 
consistency of jelly, it is sufficiently done. 

262. Cakes, Gingerbread, Nuts, ^. 

General directions. — Cake, to be nice, must be made of 
nice materials, and must be nicely made. The butter, eggs, 
and flour should all be fresh. Brown sugar does very well 
for most kinds of cake if rolled free from lumps, and stirred 
to a cream with the butter, or until white ; then adding 
the eggs, flour, and spices. The sugar should be dry, and 
of a light color. The flour should be sifted, and if not per- 
fectly dry, it will make the cake heavy. The whites and 
yolks of the eggs should be beaten to a froth, separately. 
•Salseratus and soda should be completely dissolved, and fil- 



ll(^ 1-1 .1 I ■ ■- I MIL ^ . A t itr^^^^fw^^^^m^^m.mi^mr^mm^^m^m^'^^^'^^a^^^^^'^^I^Hmmtfmr^ 



\ 



CAKES9 GINGERBREAD, AND NUTS. 103 

tered before put into the cake. Raisins should have the '• 
seeds taken out, or be stoned. Zante currants should be 
rinsed in several waters to cleanse them, rubbed in a dry 
cloth to get the sticks out, and then spread on platters and 
thoroughly dried. Almonds should be blanched and dried, 
then pounded fine with a little rose-water to prevent their 
oiling. In cold weather the ingredients for cake should be 
warmed moderately before mixing them. All kinds of cake 
made without yeast are better for being stirred just before 
they are baked. Salaeratus and cream should not be put in 
till just before the cake is baked ; add the fruit last. But- 
ter the cake pans well ; and if the pans are lined with but- 
tered white paper the cake will be less liable to burn. 
Moving cake while baking tends to make it heavy ; avoid 
the moving of it if possible. The quicker most kinds of 
cake are baked, without burning, th€ better — the lighter. 

It is impossible to give definite rules as to the time re- 
quired for baking cake. It should be often looked at while 
baking; if it browns too fast, a cover of white paper should 
be put over it. To know when rich cake is done, run a 
clean broom splinter through the thickest part of the loaf, 
and if none of the cake adheres to the splinter, it is baked 
enough. Cake that easily moves on the fiat tins on which 
it is baked, is done enough. 

263. Frosting for Cake, 

Allow for the white of one egg, nine large teaspoonfuls of 
double refined sugar, and one of nice Poland starch, both 
powdered and sifted through a very fine sieve. Beat the 
whites of eggs so stiff* they will adhere to the bottom of the 
plate on turning it upside down ; then stir the sugar in 
gradually with a wooden spoon, stirring constantly about 
fifteen minutes ; add a teaspoonful of lemon juice, or vine- 
gar, and a little rose-water. Stir in ^few grains of cochi- 
neal powder, or rose pink, if you wish to color pink ; or of 
the powder blue, if you wish to have it of a bluish tinge. 
Before icing a cake, dredge it all over with flour, and then 
wipe off the flour; the icing may thus be spread on more '« 
evenly. Lay the frosting on the cake with a knife, soon 
after it is drawn from the oven, (it may be either warm or 



104 CAKfiSy GINGERBREAD, AND K17Tt. 

^old ;) smooth it over, and set in a cool place till haid. 
Allow the whites of three eggs for two common sized loaves. 
The appearance of the cake will be much improved by icing 
it twice. Put on the first icing soon after the cake is taken 
out of the oven, and the second the next day, after the first 
is perfectly dry. 

Before cutting an iced cake, cut the icing first, by itself^ 
by pressing the back of the knife nearest the blade end 
across the cake, to prevent the cracking and breitking of the 
icing. Fresting is easiest made by heating the whites and 
stigar together, 

264. Lemon Cake. 

Take one teacup of butter, and three of powdered loaf 
sugar ; rub them to a cream ; stir into them the yolks of 
five eggs well beaten ; dissolve a teaspoonful of salaeratus 
in a teacup of milk, and add the milk ; add the juice and 
grated peel of one lemon, and the whites of the ive eggs ; 
aad sift in, as light as possible, four teacups of fiour. Bake 
in two long tins about half an hour. Much improved by 
icing. 

265. Rich Queen Cake. 

Take a mixed teaspoonful of powdered and sifted mace 
and cinnamon, and one nutmeg ; put one pound of powdered 
white sugar into a deep earthern pan, and cut one pound of 
fresh butter washed to it, and stir them till very light. 
Beat ten eggs in a broad shallow platter till perfectly 
smooth and thick ; and take fourteen ounces of sifted flour*; 
stir into the butter and sugar a little of the beaten egg, and 
then a little of the flour, and so on alternately, till the whole 
is in ; all the time beating the eggs and stirring the mixture 
very hard. Add, by degrees, the spice ; and then, a little 
at a time, a mixed wineglass of brandy and wine, and half 
a glass of rose-water, or twelve drops of essence of lemon. 
Stir the whole very hard, adding a pound and a half of well 
prepared currants. 

Take about two dozen little tins, and rub them well with 
fresh butter. Put some of the mixture, with a spoon in eaclt 
tiii, not filling it, as it will rise high in baking. Bake about 
fi^en minutes, in a quick oven. When done, the cakes 
wm%hrink a little from the sides of the tins. Make an

alone, and twenty-four teaspoonfuls of the best of loaf sugar 
powdered, and beaten gradually into the egg. Flavor it 
with a teaspoonful of rose-water, or eight drops of the essence " 
of lemon, stirred in at the last. Spread it evenly, with a 
broad knife, over the top of each queen cake, ornamenting 
while ^he icing is quite wet, with fine sugar sand, ^hK>pped 
on carefully with the thumb and finger. Set them in a 
warm pla^ to dry ; but not too near the fire, as that will 
cause the icing to crack. 

266. Family Queen Cake. 

Take a pound of sifted flour, one of sugar, and three- 
quarters of butter ; rub the butter and sugar to a cream ; add 
the well-beaten yolks of five eggs, one gill of wine, one of 
brandy, and one of cream, with part of the flour, and a pound 
of stoned raisins, or well prepared currants, and spices to 
the taste ; and then add the whites of the five eggs be^gtoL 
to a stiff" froth, with the remainder of the flpur. A 

267: Sponge Cake, No. 1. 

Beat twqjve eggs as light as possible, (for sponge and 
almond cake they require more beating than for any thing 
else ;) beat a pound of loaf sugar, powdered and sifted, by 
degrees, into the eggs, continuing to beat sometime very 
hard afler all the the sugar is in ; (none but loaf sugar will 
make light sp<R^e cake.) Stir in, gradually, a powdered 
teaspoonfu^ofnss;i^d cinnamon and mace, a grated nutmeg, 
and twelve drops of lemon essence ; lastly, by degrees, put 
in len ounces of sifted flour, dried near the fire, stirring 
round the mixture very slowly with a knife. If the flour is 
stirred too hai^ the cake will be tough. It must he done 
gently and lightly, so that the top of* the mixture will be 
covered with bubbles. As soon as the flour is all in, begin 
to bake, as setting will hurt it. 

Put it in small tins, well buttered, or in one large tin pan. 
The thinner the pans, the better for sponge cake. Fill the 
small tins about half full. Grate loaf sugar over the top of 
e/ich before setting them in the oven. Wb^ baked, turn 
over the cakes and frost them

tw« pounds of lard. The fat should be hot enough to boil 
up as the cakes are put in, and a brisk fire kept under the

194 YEAST. 



343. Convenient YettsU 

Receipt of an excellent Virginia housekeeper' in Wil- 
liamsburg. The bread will never sour ; and it may be baked 
the same morning the yeast is made. Put into sufficient 
water, two quarts of wheat bran, one pint of Indian bran, 
a handful of hops, and a teacup of parched corn, and boil 
all'together ; strain it ; when all but cold, stir in a teacup 
of molasses, and add sufficient old yeast to make it ferment ; 
then turn o^ the white scum and bottle it. Mix some of 
the yeast with a little flour, in a teacup, adding a little su- 
gar ; and set it near the fire about one hour before wanted 
for use. Take off from the dough a piece for uJb, any 
time during the day. If some of the dough is reserved for 
light and tender biscuit for tea ; work down the dough ; add 
a little butter; mould your biscuit; warm and oil your 
baker, and warm the lid and bake. 

344. MtM YeasU 

It is very nice for biscuit. T^ke half the milk wanted 
for your biscuit; place it where warm, adding a little flour 
and salt. When light, mix it witMl||j^^f the milk, and 
use it directly for the biscuit. A pintofflro yeast is suffi- 
cient for five or six loaves of bread. It makes sweeter 
bread than any other yeast, but it will not keep. 

345. Potato Yeast. 

Peel and boil soft, a large Irish potato ; rub it through a 
.sieve ; add an equal quantity of flour ; make it liquid with 
.hop tea ; when a little warmer than new milk, add a gill of 
good yeast. Stir it well, and keep it closely covered in a 
small pitcher. 

346. Patent Yeast. 

Put half a pound of fresh hops to a gallon of water, and 
boil it away to two quarts ; strain it, and add enough flour 
to make it a thin batter ; then add half a pint of good yeast. 
When well fermented, turn it into a bowl, and work in suf- 
ficient com meal to make it of the consistency of biscuit 
dough. Let it rise. When quite light, make it into little 



cakes, and dry them in the shade, tutning them frequently^ 
and keeping ibem free from damp and dust. 

Where brewer's yeast can be had, it will t© more coa* 
venient to take a quart of that, and a quart of water, about 
milk warm, and work in enough Indian meal to make it the 
consistency of biscuit dough, and then proceed as with the 
two quarts of hop water. 

To prepare the cakes for use, take one or more of .ihe 
cakes, according to your flour i turn on a little warm watery 
when it is dissolved, stir it well ; thicken with a little flour, 
and set it near the fire to rise before it is used. The best 
thing to keep yeast in is a small mug or pitcher, with a close 
stopper, under which place a double fold of linen, to make 
it quite close. This is much preferable to a bottle, and b 
easier cleaned. 

347. Wheat Bread. 

Take for half a dozen sized loaves of bread, three pintd 
of boiling water ; and mix it with fire or six quarts of flour. 
After thoroughly mixed, add three pints of cold water and 
stir the whole to the same temperature. When lukewarm, 
stir in half a pintQ^^|H||r yeast, or a gill of brewer's yeast, 
and a spoonfnJgHlH^and knead in flour, free of lumps, 
till stiflf enough to mould up. The bread is improved by 
much kneading. Cover it over with a thick cloth, and if 
the weather is cold, place it near the fire. To know when 
it is risen, cut it through the middle with a knife, and if full 
of small holes like a sponge it is light enough for baking ; 
and it should be baked immediately. If it should get sour 
before you are ready to bake, dissolve two or more tea- 
spoonfuls of salseratus, according to its acidity, in a teacup» 
of milk or water ; strain it on the dough ; work it in well ; 
then cut off" enough for a loaf; mould it up neatly ; gash it 
on both sides to prevent cracking when baked ; and set it 
in a buttered tin pan. Let the pans stand ten or twelve 
minutes before baking, and let them stand in the oven about 
an hour and a half, if you wish your bread baked much. 

If the wheat is grown, the bread is better wet up entirely 
with boiling water. It should remain till cool before adding 
the yeast. Some think the life of the flour is killed by 
scalding it — ^mistake ; the bread will be sweeter ; and it

will keep the longer good. Thus wet up, the bread is 
nearly as good as if wet with milk. Do not put in the 
yeast while the dough is hot; by its scalding the yeast 
it will kill the life of it. Most ovens need heating about 
an hour and a half. The doors of the room should foe kept 
shut, if the weather is cold ; and a brisk fire kept up. . To 
know if your oven is of a right temperature, when cleaned, 
throw in a httle flour ; if it brown in the course of a minute, 
it has a right heat ; if it turns immediately black, wait a 
few minutes before setting in. If the oven does not bake 
well, set in a furnace of live coals. A mixture of pine and 
ash, birch, and maple, are all good oven wood. 

34B. Excellent Family Bread, 

Take a peck of sifted flour, half a pint of family yeast, or 
a gill of brewer's yeast ; and wet up, with new milk of 
natural warmth, or with skim milk, or water milkwarm, 
adding a little shortening and a teaspoonful of salt. Knead 
it faithfully. Be particular to leave the dough soft, if wheat ; 
and stiff, if rye. 




349. Sponge Bn 

Take, for four loaves of bread, three quarts of wheat flour, 
and three of boiling water ; mix them thoroughly, and let 
the mixture remain till lukewarm ; then add twelve spoon- 
fuls of family yeast, or six of brewer^s ; place it where 
warm, to rise. When light, knead in flour to make it suflSl- 
ciently stiff to mould up. Let it stand for a second rising, 
then mould it 

350. Rye Bread, 

Wet the flour with lukewarm milk, (water will do, but it 
{« not so good,) putting in the same proportions of yeast as 
for wheat bread. Put in two teaspoonfuls of salt for four 
or five loaves of bread ; and two spoonfuls of melted butter 
make it more tender. It should be kneaded more stiflT 
than wheat bread. When light, put it into pans without 
moulding it up ; alid let it remain in them, before baking, 
about twenty minutes.

351. Brovm Bread. 

Take equal quantities of Indian meal and rye flour; scald 
(he meal ; when lukewarm, mix in the flour, adding yeast 
and salt, and kneading as for other hread. Bake from two 
to three hours. A good substitute for Graham or dispeps^ 
bread. 

352. Indian Bread, 

Mix, as for a thick gruel, Indian meal and cold water ; 
stir the mixture into boiling water ; let it boil half an 
hour ; stir in a little salt ; take it from the fire ; let it re- 
main till lukewarm ; and then stir in yeast and Indian meal 
till of the consistency of common dough. When light, take 
it out into buttered pans ; let it remain a few minutes, then 
bake it about two hours and a half. 



353. Graham Bread. 

To be sure of having a good article, send good, clean 
wheat to mill ; have it ground rather coarsely, without 
bolting ; and keep the meal in a dry cool place. Sift it 
through a common hair sieve, before using it. This will 
sufficiently separate the grosser particles. 

Take six quarts of this wheat meal, one teacup of good 
yeast, and six spoonfuls of molasses, and mix them with a 
pint of milk warm water and a teaspoonful of salaeratus. 
Make a hole in the flour, and stir this mixture in the mid- 
dle of the meal till it is like batter. Then proceed as with 
fine flour. Make it, when light enough, into four loaves. 
Make your oven hotter than for common bread ; and bake 
about an hour and a half. It is an excellent article of diet 
for the dispeptic and the costive, and for sedentary persons, ^ 
fmd for children, (»

354. Com Meal Bread. 

Take a piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg ; rub it 
Into a pint of corn meal ; make it a batter with two eggs 
and some new milk ; add a spoonful of yeast, and set it by ^ 

the fire an hour to rise ; butter little pans,.and bake it. '^

a little salt ; sift them, and make a thin batter with four 
eggs and a sufficient quantity of rich milk. Bake it in a 
quick oven, in little tin moulds. 

356. Mixed Breads 

Put a teaspoonful of salt, and a spoonful of yeast into a 
quart of flour ; make it sufficiently soft with com meal 
grael. When well risen, bake it in a mould. It is an ex- 
cellent bread for breakfast. Indifferent flour will rise bet- 
ter made with gmel than with fair water. 

357. Rice Bread, No. 1. 

Boil six ounces of rice in a quart of water till dry and 
soft ; put it into two pounds of flour and mix it well ; add

in moulds, when well risen. 

358. Rice Bread, No. 2. 

Boil a pint of rice till soft ; mix it with two quarts of 
wheat or rice flour ; when cool, add six spoonfuls of yeast, 
a little salt, and milk to reduce it nearly to the consistency 
of wheat dough. Bake it, when light, in small buttered 
pans. 

359. Potcao Bread, 

Boil thoroughly, and mash fine, mealy potatoes ; add salt 
and a very little butter ; mb them with twice their quantity 
of flour ; stir in your yeast, and wet up with lukewarm milk 
or water, till stiff enough to mould up. It will rise quick- 
er than common wheat bread ; and it should be baked as 
soon as risen, for it soon sours. 

360. French RoUs, No. 1.

while the oven is heatins:. 

367. Hard Biscuit, 

Take four pounds of flour ; rub three pounds and a half 
of it with a quarter of butter, four well-beaten eggs, and two 
teaspoonfuls of salt ; moisten it with milk, pound it out thin, 
with a rolling pin, and sprinkle a \little of the reserved flour 
lightly over it. Roll it up and pound it out again, and 
sprinkle on more flour. Continue to repeat this operation 
till you work in all the reserved flour ; then roll it out thin, 
cut it into cakes with a tumbler, lay them on flat, buttered, 
tins, and cover them with a damp cloth to prevent their 
drying. Bake them in a quick oven. 

368. Sahsratus Biscuit, 

Put two teaspoonfuls of salaeratus to a pint of sour milk. 
If you have no sour milk, put a spoonful of vinegar to a

370. Potato Biscuit. 

To four good sized, mealy potatoes, boiled soft, peeled, 
and mashed, add a piece of butter as big as a hen's egg, and 
a teaspoonful of salt. Wh«n the butter is melted, put in 
half a pint of cold milk. . If the milk sufficiently cools the 
potatoes, put in a gill of yeast, and flour enough to mako 
them of a right consistency to mould up. Place them where 
warm ; when risen, mould them up with the hand ; let them 
remain ten or fifteen minutes, and bake. 

371. Crackers, 

Rub six ounces of butter into two pounds of flour ; dis- 
solve two teaspoonfuls of salaeratus in a wineglass of milk, 
and strain it on the flour ; add a teaspoonful of salt, and 
milk sufficient to roll it out. Beat it with a rolling pin for 
half an hour, pounding it out thin ; cut it into cakes with a 
tumbler ; bake them about fifteen minutes, and then take 
them out of the oven. When the rest of your things are 
baked enough, take them out, set in the crackers again, and 
let them remain till baked hard and crispy. 

372. Economy Cakes, 

Bread that has been rusked, or that is old and sour, can 
be made into good cakes. Cut the bread into small pieces, 
and soak it till very soft, in cold water ; drain off the water, 
and mash the bread fine. To three pints of the pulp add 
two well-beaten eggs, three or four spoonfuls of floi^r, and 
a little salt. Dissolve a teaspoonful of salaeratus to a tea 
cup of milk, strain, and stir it into the bread. Add milk 
till the batter is of a consistency little thicker than for buck 
wheat cakes, and fry it in the same riianner. 

Another way, which is very godfl. Mix a tumbler of 
wheat flour with two spoonfuls of yelst, and sufficient cold 
water, or milk, to make it a thick batter. When light, 
Biix the batter withr the bread, reduced to a pulp, adding a

ing to the pan. 

373. Buckwheat Cakes, 

Mix a quart of buckwheat flour with a pint of lukewarm 
milk, or water, and twelve spoonfuls of yeast, and set it in 
a warm place to rise. When light, which will be in eight 
or ten hours j or sooner if brewer's yeast is used, add a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and if sour, a teaspoonfui of salaeratus dis- 
solved in a little milk and strained. If too thick, thin them 
with cold milk and water. Fry them in just sufficient fat 
to prevent their sticking to the frying pan. 

374. Green Com Cakes, 

Take a pint of grated green com, three spoonfuls of milk, 
and a teacup of flour ; mix with them, half a teacup of 
melted butter, an egg, a teaspoonfui of salt, and half a tea-

375. Indian Com Cakes. 

Mix a quart of Indian meal with a handful of wheat-flour, 
stir inte a quart of warmed milk, a teaspoonfui of salt, and 
two spoonfuls of yeast ; stir, alternately into the milk, the 
meal and three well-beaten eggs ; when light, bake as buck- 
wheat cakes on a griddle, send them to the table hot. 
Should the batter sour, stir in a little salaeratus dissolved in 
luke-warm water, letting it set half an hour before baking. 

376. Indian Slap Jacks, 

Take and scald a quart of Indian meal, in milk, if you 
have it — ^water will do, turn it out, and stir in half a pint 
of flour, half a pint of yeast, and a little salt. Fry them, 
when light, in just fat sufficient to keep them from sticking 
to the frying pan. 

Another nice way. Turn a quart of boiling milk or wa-

HOT CAKES. 183 

377. Journey or Johnny Cakes, 

Sift and scald a quart of Indian meal with water enough 
> to make a very thick batter ; add two or three teaspoonfate 
of salt, and mould it into small cakes with the hands. In 
moulding up, the hands will need a good deal of flouring to 
prevent their sticking. Fry them in nearly sufficient fat to 
cover them. When brown on the under side^ turn them^ 
Cook them about twenty minutes. When done, split and 
butter them. 

Another way, which is nice. Put to a quart of scalded 
Indian meal a teaspoonful of salt, the same of salseratus 
dissolved in milk> adding two or three spoonfuls of wheat 
flour. Drop the batter by spoonfuls into the frying pan. 
The batter should be very thick, and there should be just 
fat sufficient to prevent the cakes sticking to the frying pan. 

378. Hoe Cakes.

yeast, and a teaspoonful of salt. Fill your waffle irons with 
the batter, when risen, and bake on a hot bed of cottb. 
Turn the waffle irons over, when they have been oa the 
fire between two and three minutes. They are done 
enough when brown on both sides. The waffle irons 
should be very hot, and well oiled with lard, before each 
cake is put in. The cakes should be buttered as quick as 
cooked. Serve them up with fine white sugar and cinnamon.

batter. 

384. Breakfast Rice Cakes, 

Put half a pound of rice to soak over night ; boil it very 
soft in the morning, drain ofi" the water, mix it with four 
ounces of melted butter, and set it away to cool. When 
cold, stir it into a quart of milk, adding a little salt ; then 
stir in, alternately six eggs and half a pint of sifted fiour. 
Beat all well together, and bake on the griddle in cakes 
about the size of a* small dessert plate. Butter and send 
them to the table, ,hot. 

Instead of preparing the rice, cold boiled rice makes very 
nice cakes, mixed and cooked as the prepared. 

385. Wafers. 

To the whites of twelve eggs add a pint of fiour, two 
ounces of melted butter, and enough milk to make a thin 
batter, adding fine loaf sugar to the taste. Pour into the 
wafer irons, bake quickly without browning, and roll theoi 
while hot.

405. Moss Blanc Mange. 

Take three sprigs of moss well washed, put it in one 
quart of cold water, over the fire ; let it remain till scalding 
hot, (to extract the bitter taste,) then squeeze it dry, put it 
in a quart of cold milk, boil the milk half an hour, then 
strain it through a fine sieve ; season it with white sugar, 
white wine, and essence of lemon, and turn it into the 
moulds to cool. 

406. Rice Flouf Blanc Mange. 

Mix 'four spoonfuls of ground rice, very smooth, with a 
tumbler of cold milk, and stir it into a quart of boiling milk ; 
add the grated rind of a lemon, half the juice, a blade of 
mace, and sweetening, to the taste. Boil all six or eight 
minutes, stirring it frequently. Set it from the fire. When 
cool, add the beaten whites of three eggs, put it again on 
the fire, stir it constant^ till nearly boQing hot, turn it into 
deep cups or moulds, and let it remain ^U cold. It is nice 
foriavalicls.

407. Ice Cream, y 

Take a quart of noli cream boiled and set away till cold, 
half a pound of loaf sugar powdered, the juice of two large 
lemons, or of a pint ai raspberries or strawberries, or aa 
oimce of bitter almonds blanched and pounded with rose* 
water. Put the cream into a broad pan, then stir into it the 
sugar by degrees, till well mixed, and strain it through a 
sieve. Put it into a tin that has a close cover, and set the 
tin in a tub ; fill the ti^ with ice broken in very small 
pieces, and strew among the ice a large quantity of salt, 
being careful that none of the salt get into the cream. 
Scrape the cream down with a spoon as it freezes round 
the edges of the tin. While the cream is freezing, stir in 
gradually the lemon juice or the juice of a pint of mashed 
strawberries. When it is all frozen, dip the tin in luke- 
warm water ; take out the cream and fill your glasses just 
as ready to use it. It will soon melt. Essence of lemon, 
and the juice of pine apples, are nice to flavor the cream. 

408. Ice Cream without Cream. 

Where cream cannot be procured, a custard made in &e 
following manner may be substituted : — ^To a quart of milk, 
add the beaten yolks of four eggs and a vanilla bean or the 
rind of a lemon ; set it on a few coals, making it very sweet 
with white sugar ; stir it constantly till scalding hot, but do 
not let it boil. Remove it from the fire, and take out the 
lemon peel or bean. When perfectly cold, put it in an ice 
cream form — if you have none, a milk kettle with a tight 
cover may be substituted. Set the form into the centre of 
a tub that is large enough to leave a space of ^yq inches 
from the form to the outside of the tub ; fill the space round 
the form with alternate layers of finely cracked ice and 
rock salt, having a layer of ice last, and the whole just as 
high as the form. The tub should be covered with a wool- 
en cloth while the cream is freezing, and the form should 
be constantly shaken. If you wish to shape the cream, 
pour it into moulds as soon as it freezes, set them in the 
tub, let them remain till just before they are to be eaten, 
then dip them in warm water, and take them immediately 
out, and turn them into dessert dishes.

409. Lemon Cream. 

Pare the yellow part only of four fresh lemons ; soak it 
twelve hours in half a pint of cold water, then add the juice 
of the lemons, and half a pint more of cold water. Beat 
to a froth the yolks of three eggs and the whites of eight ; 
strain the lemon juice and water, and mix it with the eggs; 
ftweet^i it with double refined sugar, stir it till it grows 
thick, then take it from the fire-«tir it till cold. Serve it 
up in glasses. Orange cream is made in the same way. 

410. VcmtUa Cream. «- 

Boil a Vanilla bean in a quart of rich milk until suffi- 
ciently flavored ; take it out, mix with the milk eight well- 
beaten eggs, and boil it a little longer, making it very sweet, 
as much of the sugar is lost in freezing. 

411. Strawberry, Raspberry, or Blackberry Cream. 

Make a quart of rich boiled x^ustard, when cold, pour it 
on a quart of ripe fruit; mash, pass through a sieve, sweeten, 
and freeze it. 

412. Coffee Cream 
Brown two gills of coffee, put it hot, unground, into a 
quart of sweet rich milk, boil it, adding the yolks of eight 
eggs ; strain it through a sieve, sweeten, imd freeze it. If 
rightly done it will not be discolored. The coffee may be 
dried and used for tea. 

413, Qumccj Apple, or Pear, Cream. 

Wash nice fruit, and boil it whole till very tender ; let 
it drain and cool ; rub it through a hair sieve ; add an equal 
quantity of cream, and sweeten it. If liked colored, a little 
saffron or cochineal may be added. 

414. Peach Cream* 

Peel and stone nice mellow peaches; put them in a 
bowl ; sprinkle on sugar ; chop them very fine with a silver 
spoon, or reduce them to a smooth pulp ; i|dd as much rich 




'Si. 142 CRJBAM8. 

ini&, or cream as you hare peach ; add more sugar, and 
freeze it. 

415. Pine Apple , or Citron^ Cream, 

Cut nice ripe pine apples, or citron melons, selecting tho 
best parts, in small pieces, into a china bowl, cover tiiem 
with powdered sugar, and let them stand seTC)^ hours ; 
drain off the sirup, add to it as much cream as it will fla^ 
Yor, and freeze it. 

416. SagOf or Barley, Cream. 

Wash Ihe sago, or barley, clean ; put it on the fire, with 
a stick of cinnamon, and only sufficient water to boil it 
thick and soil ; take out the stick ; add rich boiled custard 
tiU it is of a proper cons'stency ; sweeten it, and serve it 
with nutmeg on the tc^. A litde white wine may be added 
if liked. 

417. The Froth, 

Sweeten half a pound of the pulp of damisons, or any 
kind of scalded fruit, mix with it the well-beaten whites of 
four eggs, and beat them together till a very stiff froth. 

418. Fruit Tart Cream. 

Boil a stick of cinnamon, two or three peach leaves, or a 
few bruised almonds, in a quart of cream or milk ; strain, 
sweeten, and mix it, when cool, with three or four well- 
beaten eggs, and stir it constantly over the fire till it thick- 
ens. It may be eaten with stewed apples, damsons, prunes, 
or any other fruit. 

419. Pink or Red Currant Cream, 

Squeeze three gills of juice from red currants, quite ripe, 
add to it nine ounces of powdered loaf «ugar, and the juice 
of one lemon ; stir it into a pint and a half of cream, and 
whisk it till quite thick. Serve it in a glass dish or in 
jelly glasses. It may be made of currant jeUv mixed with 
lemon juice and sugar. Raspberry and str^wbeYxy crwun 
may be made in the same way. 



r> T£OETABLfi«. 148 

420. To Ornament Creams or Custards, 

Ts^e the whites of two eggs, and two spoonfuls of rai^ 
berry, or red currant sirup, or jelly, and whisk them to- 
gether one hour. Lay the froth in any fotm upon a cream 
or custard, piled up to imitate rock* It may be served in a 
dish by itself, with cream around it. 

421. White Lemon Cream, 

Boil the thin peel of two lemons in a pint of cream, strain 
and thicken it with the well-beaten yolks of three, and 
the whites of four, eggs ; sweeten with powdered loaf su- 
gar, stir till nearly cold, and put it in glasses. 

-^ ' 422. Lemonade Ice, 

' With a quart of rich lemonade, mix the well-beaten 
whites of six fresh eggs, and freeze it. 

The juice of Morello cherries, or of currants, mixed with 
sugar and water, and prepared in the same way, makes 
very delicate ices. 

423. Vegetables. 

As a general rule, add a little salt to the water in which 
you cook your vegetables, with the exception of driQ.d beans 
and peas. 

424. Potatoes, 

The easiest way to cook Irish potatoes, is to put them in 
just enough boiling water to cover them, with the skins on, 
and to boil them constantly till done. It is the best way ; 
and then to send them hot to the table with the skins on, 
or at that moment taken off. A plain boiled or roasted po- 
tato, when well cooked, is best and most healthful. You 
thus get the grateful flavor of the potato. Potatoes should 
not lie soaking in the water without boiling, if you wish 
them mealy. 

Some cooks say, pare and put them in a pot, with jus* 
boiling water enough to prevent, their burning, and a little 
salt ; cover them tight, and boil them till you can easily 
stick a fork through them ; and if any water remains, turn 

7 





144 rXOBTABUBS. 

it off. and put the pot where it will keep modemtdy wwrm, 
sad let the potatoes steam, with the lid off, a few miaiites ; 
then dish them, covering them with a cloth. Old and poor 
potatoes are best boiled till sofl, and then peeled and mashed 
fine, with a little butter, salt, and cream or milk added, and 
then put into a dish, smoothed over with a knife, a little 
flour sprinkled over, and set where they will brown. Ck>ld 
prepared, or whole boiled potatoes, are nice sliced, and fried 
wim just sufficient butter or lard to prevent their burning. 
When brown on both sides, take them up, and salt and 
butter them. Most potatoes will boil in half an hour ; new 
^ ones in less time. Some cooks say, put your potatoes into 
cold water to boil them, and neither cover them while boil- 
ing, nor after they are dished. As commoj^^egetable as 
is the potato, no two cooks are agreed in^'^BK^est manner 
of cooking it. The best and only satisfactory receipt is : 
suit your own taste. 

425. Potato Snow BaUs. 

After boiled tender, drain off the water, and let the pota- 
toes steam till they break to pieces ; take them up, put two 
or three at a time compactly together in a strong cloth, and 
press them tight into a ball, and lay them on a gridiron to 
broil till of a light brown. Or, mix prepared potatoes with 
the yolk of an egg^ roll them into balls, flour them or cover 
. them with egg and bread crums ; fry them in good drip- 
pings, or brown them in an oven. 

426. FfiBd Potatoes, Apples, and Onions, 

Fry brown a few pieces of salt pork, and take them up. 
Put into the fat, or part of it, raw peeled potatoes sliced 
very thin, and fry them till brown, occasionally stirring 
ihem. Fry sliced pleasant tart apples, and onions, in the 
same manner. Thus prepared, they make a cheap, plain, 
and very good dish. The potatoes may be cut in shavings, 
like apple-parings, if preferred. 

427. Roast Potatoes, 

Ml Take potatoes of the same size, wash and dry them, put 

them in a tin Dutch oven or some convenient toaster ; do 

* not bum the outside before they are warmed through. 



Roast lafgd ones i^ut two' hours. They^ wiU xoast quicker 
if first parboiled. 

428. To Roast Potatoes under Meat. 

Pare raw potatoes and salt them ; put them in your drip- 
ping pan aroimd your meat, and now and then turn them. 

429. Potato Croqaettes. 

Take four large mealy potatoes boiled and peeled, half 
their weight of butter and of pounded loaf sugar, two eggs 
beaten, half the grated peel of a lemon, and a little salt ; 
pound the potatoes in a mortar with the otlier ingredients, 
beat the yolk of four eggs, roll up the croquettes, dip them 
in the beaten eggs, and roll them in sifted bread crums ; 
in an hour roU. them, again, and fry them in butter, 

430. Sweet Potatoes* 

Take such as are of the same size, wash but do not ppel 
them ; boil tender, drain off the water, and put them on tin 
sheets in a stove till of a light brown. Or, cut them cross- 
wise without peeling, in slices half an inch thick ; broil 
them on a griddle, and serve them with drawn butter. 

431. Turnips, 

Take such turnips as are white and smooth, and scrape 
them lightly, but thoroughly, rinsing them in cold water ; 
put them into boiling water with a little salt, and continue 
the boiling about ten minutes, or until you can easily force 
a fork into them. Carry them instantly from the pot to the 
table very hot, with drawn butter. For mashing, turnips 
may want a very little more boiling, and perhaps paring. 
Cook them perfectly tender, squeeze them quite dry^ ma^ 
them very smooth, butter, salt, and pepper them. 

Yellow turnips require longer cooking than white- ones 
If very large, split them in two. 

432. Ragout of Turnips. 
Prepare, as for boiling, turnips sufBcient to fill a dish ; 






put them into a stew pan, with a little butter, salt and 
sugar ; set them over a hot stove ; shake and turn them till 



I 



146 ▼SGETABLES. 

of a good brown ; add half a pint of rich grary, stew them 
tOl tender, and serve them with the added gravy. 

433. Beets, 

To rightly prepare beets for boiling— do not spoil them 
by over-preparing them — ^neither cut nor scrape them. By 
bleeding they become insipid ; only wash them. Boil them 
till tender ; in summer one hour, in winter three. The 
tops, when tender, are good to boil for greens. Boiled 
beets are nice, sliced into cold spiced vinegar, after remain- 
ing in it a few days. 

434. Parsnips and Carrots. 

If large, alter washing spht them in two ; lay them in a 
stew pan with the flat side down, and turn on boiling water 
enough to cover them. Boil till tender, or till you can 
easily thrust a fork through them ; take up, skin and butter 
them. ♦ 

433. Onions. 

Peel and put them into boiling milk and water — (water 
alone will do, but it is not so good.) When tender, take 
up and salt them, and turn a little melted butter over them. 

436. Boiled Sweet Corn. 

Boil corn on the cob, if you wish it sweet. Boil 'it, cut 
off the cob, with Lima beans, for succotash; boil it from fif- 
teen to thirty minutes, according to its age. 

437. Fried Sweet Com. 

Cut tender com off the cob. Put it in a pan, and add 
sufficient water to moisten it, a little salt and butter, and fry 
to the liking. 

438. Beans of Various Kinds. 

Take the strings off French or striped beans, and if old, 

cut off the edges, and cut through the middle of the beans 

lengthwise. Boil them with a little salt from twenty-five 

ft . to forty-five minutes. A little salaeratus boiled with them 

makes them more healthful, and preserves their green color. 



TEOETABZ^B. 147 

Lima beans can be kept twelve months. Wbea fresh gaA- 
ered, dry them thoroughly in the pod ; or without drying, 
pack them in a barrel with alternate layers of salt, having 
a layei: of salt at the bottom. Cover them quite tight, fiist 
laying a weight on them to press them compact. Keep 
them in a cool dry place. Snaps can be kept in the same 
way. When used, wash the pods, lay them all night in 
fresh water, shell them in the morning, and^eep them in 
water till ready to boil them. Pat them nj^is late in the 
season as possible. 

439. Boston Baked Beans. 

Take two quarts of middling sized white beans, three 
pounds of salt pork, and one spoonful of molasses. Pick 
the beans over carefully, wash and turn about a gallon of 
soft water to them in a pot ; let them soak in it lukewarm 
over night ; set them in the morning where they will boil 
till the skin is very tender and about to break, adding a tea- 
spoonful of salsratus. Take them up dry, put them in 
your dish, stir in the molasses, gash the pork, and put it 
down in the dish so as to have the beans cover all but the 
upper surface ; turn in cold water till the top is just cov- 
ered ; bake and let the beans remain in the oven all night. 

Beans are good prepared as for baking, made a little 
thinner, and then boiled several hours with the pork. 

440. Artichokes. 

Scrape and put them in boiling water, with a spoonful of 
salt to two dozen. In about two hours, or when boiled ten- 
der, take them up, salt and butter each one. 

441. Baked Squash. 

Cut '' Butter Squash" in long strips an inch and a half 
thick, and bake it half an hour in buttered tins. 

442. Boikd Squash. 

Boil summer squashes whole, if very tender ; If not, pare, 
quarter, and seed them. When boiled very tender, take 
them up, put them in a strong cloth, press out all the watpr, ,: 

mash them quite smooth, salt and butter them to your tast*. 



148 TBOXTABLBS. 

Of a winter squash the neck, part is best. Cut it in pieces, 
take off the rind, tie it in a cloth, boil in salt and water til] 
tender, press out the water, chop it in a bowl till smooth 
with a trencher, (the same for summer squash,) salt and 
butter it. 

443. Squashes or Cymlings, 

Prepare and boil as for '' Squash '' ; then put them in 
a colander, 7rain off the water till quite dr^, rub them with 
a wooden spoon through the colander, put them in a stew 
pan with a cup of cream, a piece of butter, pepper and salt, 
and stew them till very dry. 

444. Greens, 

Turnip tops, white mustard, dock, spinach, water-cresses, 
dandelions, cabbage-plants, the roots and tops of young 
beets, all make nice greens. Boil them, adding a little sal- 
aeratus and salt to the water.. If not fresh and plump, soak 
them half an hour in salt and water before coolung. When 
boiled enough they will sink to the bottom of the pot. 

445. Asparagtis, 

Cufoff and reject the white part of the stalks ; cut the 
lower part of the stalks in thin slices, if tough, and boil 
them eight or ten minutes before putting in the tops. Lay 
the tops compactly together, tie them in small bundles, and 
boil from twelve to twenty-five minutes, putting in the 
water a little salt, and a quarter of a spoonful of salseratus 
to retain their fresh green color, to two or three quarts of 
water. Just before done, toast a slice of bread, moisten it 
with some of the asparagus liquor, lay it in your dish, but- 
ter it, take up the asparagus carefully with a skimmer, lay 
it on the toast, remove the string, salt and turn a little drawn 
butter over the whole. Sea-kale is prepared and cooked 
in the same way. 

446. Salsify — Southern mode. 

Scrape and wash the roots, put them into boiling water 
with a little salt. When sufficiently boiled, drain and place 
them in the dish without cutting them up. They are an 



TEOBTABLEiS. 149 

cSicedlent vegetable, but require nicety in cooking. Expo- 
sure to the air, either in scraping or after boiling, makes 
them black. 

447. Scitsify or Vegetable Oyster. 

After scraping off the outside, parboil it, slice it, dip the 
slices into a beaten egg and fine bread crums, and fry in 
lard. It is very good boiled, and then ste^^^^a few min- 
utes in milk, with a little salt and butter. Or^ake a batter 
of wheat flour, milk, and eggs ; cut the salsify in thin slices, 
&st boiling it tender ; put them into the batter with a little 
salt ; drop the mixture into hot fat by spoonfuls. Cook 
them till of a light brown* 

448. Peas, . 

Peas are . best picked and shelled immediately before 
cooking. Put them in boiling water with a little salt and 
salsBratus, in the proportion of a quarter of a teaspoonful to 
half a peck of peas. Boil them from twenty to forty-five 
minutes. When perfectly tender, take them up with a 
skimmer ; salt and butter them to the taste. 

449. Field Peas, 

Gather, prepare, and boil them the same as "Peas"; 
then pour them into a colander ; put some butter or lard in 
a frying pan ; when it boils mash the peas, fry them till of 
a light brown in a cake, and put it in a dish with the crust 
uppermost, and garnish with thin bits of fried bacon. They 
are very nice fried whole, so that each pea is distinct from 
the others. But they must be boiled less, and fried with 
great care. Plain boiling is a very common way of cook 
ing them. When dried, cook peas like dried beans. 

450. Cabbage and Cauliflowers, 

Remove the loose leaves, quarter the stump end to the 
heart of the cabbage, wash and have it perfectly clean, and 
boil it from half an hour to an hour. If not boiled with 
salt meat, add a little salt ; a little sals&ratus improves its 
color. White cauliflowers are the best. Take off the out- 
side leaves, let them lie in cold water anfl^alt half an how, 



150 TKGBTAEUIS. 

then boil them bam fifteen to tweaty-fire miantes in ndlk 
and water, with a little salt, or in clear water. Keep the 
cabbage covered with water. It will ameliorate the flavor 
of old strong ones, to boil them in two waters. When half 
done, take diem out, and put them into a sauce pan of boil- 
ing water. 

451. Brocoli, 

The kindm^at bears flowers around the joints of the 
stalks, cut into convenient lengths for your dish ; scrape the 
skin from the stalk, and pick out such leaves and flowers 
as need rejection ; tie up in bunches, imd boil and season 
it like asparagus. The brocc^i that heads at the top hke 
cauliflowers, must be treated like cauliflowers. 

452. Celeriac 

This, though an excellent vegetable, seems to be but 
little known. The stalks of it can hardly be distinguished 
from celery : it is much easier cultivated. The roots are 
nice boiled tender, cut in thin slices, and used in soup or 
in meat pies. Or, scrape and cut them in slices, boil till 
very tender, drain ofl* the water, sprinkle on a little salt, 
turn in milk sufficient to cover them ; stew four or five 
minutes, turn into a dish, and give them a little butter. 

453. Gtimbo, 

Take an equal quantity of young tender ocra, chopped 
fine, and skinned ripe tomatoes, an onion cut in slices, a 
small lump of butter, a little salt and pepper, and stew all 
in a spoonful of water till tender. 

454. Southern Manner of Boding Rice, 

Pick over the rice, rinse it repeatedly in cold water till 
perfectly clean ; then put it in a pot of boiling water with 
a little salt, allowing a quart of water to a teacup of rice. 
Boil it seventeen minutes, drain ofi* the water ver^ close, 
set the pot over a few cosds, and let it steam fifteen minutes 
with the lid off. The beauty of rice boiled in this way is, 
each kernel stands out by itself, while it is perfectly tender. 

Be very careM in the boiling and steaming, as a few 
moments vari^B in the time, may quite change its looks. 



J 



VSGETABLES. 151 

The water should boil hard when the rice is put in, and 
not stop till turned off to have the rice steamed. The water 
the rice is boiled in makes good starch for muslin, if boiled 
a few minutes by itself. 

455. Egg Plant, 

Pnrple one$ are best. Take young fresh^^es, pull out 
the stem, parboil them to take ouf the bitter tfSte, cut them 
in slices an inch thick without peeling them, dip them in 
the yolk of an egg, ajjid cover them with grated bread, and 
a little salt and pepper ; when one side has dried, cover the 
other in the same way, then fry them a nice brown. They 
are very delicious, tasting much like soft crabs. The egg- 
plant may be dressed thus : parboil it after scraping off the 
rind ; cut a slit the whol^ length, and take out the seeds ; 
£11 the space with a rich fbrce-meat ; stew it in well-season- 
ed gravy, or bake and serve it up with gravy in the dish. 

456. Pptato Pumpkin, 

Take one of a good color, seven or eight inehes in diam- 
eter, cut a piece off the top, take out the seeds, wash and 
wipe the cavity, pare it, and fill the hollow with good force- 
meat Put the top on, set it in a deep pan to protect the 
sides, bake it in a moderate oven, put it ciurefuUy in the 
dish without breaking, and it will look like a handsome 
mould. 

457. Cucumbers. 

To be salutary, they should be eaten within twenty-four 
hours after picked. Keep them in cold water, and fifteen 
or twenty minutes before eating them, pare and slice them 
into fresh cold water to take off the slimy matter. Just be- 
fore carrying to the table, drain off all the water, put them 
in a deep dish, and sprinkle on a good deal of pepper and 
salt, aad cover them with vinegar. Cucumbers are thought 
by many people to be very unhealthy ; but if properly pre- 
pared, they will not be found any more so than most other 
summer vegetables. 

To stew cucumbers, par© ten large cucumbers, cut them ' 
in thick slices, flour them well, and fry ii]|||)utter ; then put 
them in a sauce pan with a teacup of grayy^ and season 



>> 



with cftyeime, salt, and catsup. Stew ^m an hour and 
aerre them hot. 

458. Salads, 

To have this delicate dish in perfection, pick your lettnce, 
pepper-grass, chenril, cress, <&;c. early in the morning; 
v^ash and lay it in cold water, if iced the better: just l^ 
fore dinner, drain the water from your salad, cut it into a 
bowl, givin^he proper proportions of each plant, and pre- 
pare the following mixture. Boil two fresh eggs ten min- 
utes, put them in water to cool, then put the yolks in a 
soup-plate, turn on them a spoonM of cold water, rub them 
with a wooden spoon till they are quite dissolved, and add 
two spoonfuls of oil. Mix it well, adding one teaspoonfal 
of salt, one of powdered sugar, and one of made mustard. 
These all being mixed quite smooth, stir in two spoonfuls 
of tarragon vinegar, and two oP" common. Put it over the 
salad, and garnish the top with the whites of the eggs cut 
in rings, and lay around the edge of the bowl young scall- 
ions, they being the most delicate of the onion family. Some 
cooks say, if you have not salad oil, melt a little butter and 
put it in a separate dish ; if turned over the salad it will not 
be crispy. 

459. Stewed Mushrooms, 

Gather such as are grown, but are young enough to haFe 
red gills ; cut off that part of the stem which grew in the 
earth, wash them carefully, and take the skin from the top ; 
put them in a stew pan with some salt, stew them till ten- 
der, thickening them with a spoonful of butter, mixed with 
one of brown flour. A little red wine may be added ; but 
the flavor of the mushroom is too delicious to require aid 
from any thing. 

460. Broiled Mushrooms, 

Prepare them as before directed : broil them on a griddle, 
and when done, sprinkle salt and pepper on the guls, and 
put a little butter on them. 

461. Tomatoes, 

If very ripe, tomatoes will readily skin ; if not, pour scald* 
ing water on th#m, and let them remain in it four or five 



Sickles. 158 

minutes. Peel ftnd put them in a stew pan with a ispoon'* 
ful of water, if not very juicy ; if so, no water will be 
required. Put in a little salt, stew them half an hour, and 
then turn them into a deep dish with buttered toast^or omit 
the toast, and add butter and pepper. Another way of 
cooking them, which is considered very nice by epicures, 
is to put them in a deep dish, with fine bread crums, or crack- 
ers pounded fine, a layer of each alternatelyf put a little 
pepper and salt, and small bits of butter on each layer. 
Some cooks add a little nutmeg and sugar. Place a layer 
of bread cnuns on the top. Bake it forty-fire minutes. 

462. Mustard, 

Young mustard is a very good vegetable, prepared and 
cooked like other "** Greens." Ground mustard is best, 
fresh made. Mix it by (!^rees with fine salt ; rub them 
together till perfectly smooth, wetting up with a little milk, 
if it be eaten immediately ; or with hot water. 

463. Directions for Pickling, 

Take sharp cider vinegar for pickling, but not the very 
sharpest. Use brass utensils, first thoroughly cleaning 
them, and suffer no vinegar to cool in them, as the rust 
formed by so doing is very poisonous. A good way is, to 
boil alum and salt in the vinegar, in the proportion of half 
a teacup of salt and a spoonful of alum, to three gallons of 
vinegar. But for the best way of pickling cucumbers, see 
" Cucumbers." Keep pickles in a cool dry place, and either 
in glass, stone, or wooden vessels. If particular, use wide 
mouthed glass bottles, or stone jars, having corks which 
must be fitted in with linen, and covered with bladder or 
leather ; and for taking the pickles out and for returning 
them, using a small wooden spoon. It is essential to the 
beauty and excellence of the pickles, that they be always 
completely covered with vinegar. AH kinds of pickles 
should be stirred up occasionally ; the soft ones, if any, 
should be taken out, the vinegar scalded, and turned back 
scalding hot. If very weak, throw it away, and take new 
vinegar. Whenever any scum rises, scald the vinegar. If 
you do not wish to have all your pickles spiced, keep a 



154 PICKLEQ. 

Stone pot of spiced vinegar by itself, and put in. a few firom 
time to time, as you want spiced pickles. 

464. Cucumbers, 

Gather those that are small and green, and of a quick 
growth. Pour on them boiling hoc strong brine, and let 
them remain in it twenty^four hours ; take them out, let 
them dry, and put them into sharp tinegar. Repeat the 
same process daily, or as often as you wish to make addi- 
tions. The same brine may be used several times, pouring 
it on each mess of cucumbers boiling hot, and letting 
them remain twenty-four hours before taking out, drying, 
and putting into the vinegar. When you have done pick- 
ling, scald the vinegar three days in succession, pouring it 
on the cucumbers boiling hot. Jf necessary add new 
vinegar. # 

465. To pickle Cucumbers^. 

Prepare the cucumbers bj^ scalding them in brine ; put 
them into a mixture of one part whiskey and three parts 
water ; secure them closely. By Christmas they will be 
hard, of a fine flavor, and will retain their original color. 
The liquor will be excellent vinegar for the table. 

466. Tomatoes, 

Prick the skins of fair ripe tomatoes ; spread them in 
layers, and on each layer put pounded mace, cloves, and 
cinnamon, and pour cold vinegar over the whole. The 
vinegar from tomatoes thus prepared, is preferable to 
catsup. 

467. Mangoes. 

Take green muskmelons as late in the season as possi- 
ble, cut a small piece from the side that lay next the ground, 
and take out the seeds. If the citron or nutmeg melons are 
used for mangoes, scrape off the rough part. The long 
common muskmelons are best. Soak the melons in salt 
and water three or four days ; take them out, sprinkle the 
inside with powdered cloves, pepper and nutmeg ; fill them 
with fine strips of horseradish, cinnamon, and small string 
beans. Nasturtions and radish tops are also nice« Fill the

crevices with American muslard seed. Ptit back the piece 
of melon that was cut ofT, and bind the melon up tight with 
white cotton cloth^ sewing it on. Pkce the melons the 
covered side up, in a stone jar. Boil alum and salt in vin- 
egar in the proportion of six spoonfuls^ of salt and one of 
alum, to three gallons of vinegar, adding peppercorns to the 
liking, and pour the vinegar, scalding hot, on the melons. 
Barberries, or radish tops, pickled in bunches, are a nice 
garnish for mangoes. The barberries preserve their natural 
color best by being first dried. Whenever wanted for use, 
turn boiling vinegar over them, and let them lay several 
hours to swell. Pickle mangoes like ** Cucumbers." 

468. Butternuts. 

Pick your butternuts abSut the fourth of July, or not so 
late but tv^hat a pin can j^dily be put through thein ; lay 
them in salt and water tS days, changing the water every 
day ; then rub off their coat with a coarse rough cloth. 
For one hundred nuts mak^ pickle of two quarts of vin- 
egar, one ounce of pulverizea pepper, one of ginger, half an 
ounce of mace, half of cloves, half of nutmegs, and a spoon- 
full of mustard «eed. Put the spices in a thin muslin bag, 
lay it in the vinegar with the nuts, and boil all a few min- 
utes, then set them away. 

469. Walnuts. 

Gather yoiar nuts in July, put them in a strong brine nine 
4ays, changing them every other day ; take them out, wipe 
them dry with a woolen cloth, put them in cold vinegar and 
salt six weeks, then make your pickle of mace, cloves, nut- 
megs, whole pepper, race ginger, garlic, shallots, bruised 
mustard seed, and horseradish — ^let it be very strong. Boil 
it, and when codd, turning off the old vinegar from the nuts, 
pour on the new — ^stop tight. 

470. Cabbage. 

Take purple cabbages for pickling. Strip off the loose 
leaves, quarter them, put them in a keg, sprinkle a great 
deal of salt on each, and let them remain all but a week. 

To a gallon of vinegar, add an ounce of mace, and one 
of peppercorns and cinnamon. Cloves and allspice improve 



f 



1 56 PIC&LBB. 

th€ taste, but darken the color of the cabbages. Add a 
little alum to the vinegar, and pour it boiling hot on tlie 
cabbages, letting the salt remain. Repeat the boiling of 
the vinegar, and turning it oq the cabbages six or seven 
times every two or three days, to make them tender. 

47J . Cabbages and OauUfiotDers, 

Slice red cabbage into a colander, and sp? inkle each 
layer with salt ; let it drain two days, then put it into a jar, 
and cover it with boiling vinegar, adding a few slices of red 
beet. Spices may be boiled in the vinegar to the taste. 
Cauliflowers, cut into bunches and thrown in after being 

salted, will have a beautiful red. 

- « 

472. Pepners, 

Take such as are fresh anc^reen ; cut a small slit in 
them ; take the seeds out carefully -and neatly with a small 
knife ; and wash them. Piggr weak boiling ,brine over 
them, and let them stand four aays, renewing the brine daily 
boiling hot. Chop cabbage fine ; season it highly with 
cinnamon, mace and cloves ; and stuff the peppers, adding 
uasturtions if liked. Sew them up nicely ; and turn the 
same sharp vinegar boiling hot over them, three snccessive 
weeks, adding a little alum the last. 

Tomatoes, if green and small, are good pickled with the 
peppers. 

473. East India Piekk. 

Chop cabbage fine, leaving out the stalks, with three 
onions, a horseradish root, and two green peppers to each 
cabbage. Soak all in salt and water three or four days. 
Season vinegar very highly with mace, cloves, cinnamon, 
and allspice. Add alum and salt to the vinegar, and pour 
it on boiling hot, the brine being previously turned oflf. It 
will be fit to eat in about three weeks. 

474. French Beans and Radish Pods. 

Take such as are qiiite small and tender ; throw them 
into salt and water as they are gathered, changing the water 
every four days. Scald them in salt and water ; let them 
remain till cool ; turn off the brine, and pour on scalding 



vic&Lss. 157 

Tiiaegar spked with mace, allspice, and pej^rcoms. The 
radish top, if pickled ia amall bunches, is a pretty garnish 
for other pickles. 

475. Peaches and Apricots, 

Take peaches, fully grown, just before becoming mellow. 
Let them lie covered in a brine made of soft water, strong 
enough to bear up an egg, one week ; take them out, wipe 
th^m carefully with a soil cloth, place them in a pickle jar. 
Put to a gallon of vinegar half an ounce of cloves, and half 
an ounce of peppercorns, sliced ginger root, mustard seed, 
and a little salt, and pour it on the peaches, boiling hot. 
Turn off the vinegar, and turn it on again, boiling hot, seve- 
ral times. 

476. Nasturtions, 

Put them when green and small in isalt and water, and 
change the water every three days. When done collecting 
the nasturtions, pour off th^ brine, and turn on boiling vin- 
egar, adding a little alum. 

477. Onions- 

Peel and boil small onions in milk and water ten minutes. 
Put to a gallon of vinegar half an ounce of cinnamon, half 
an ounce of inace, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, five 
spoonfuls of salt, and half an ounce of alum, and turn the 
whole boiling hot on the onions, the nulk and water being 
first drained from them. 

478. Gherkins. 

Put them in strong brine, and keep them where warm. 
When they turn yellow, pour off the brine, and turn on hot 
▼inegar. Keep them in^it till they turn green ; then pour 
away the vinegar, and add fresh scalding vinegar, seasoned 
with peppercorns, mace, allspice, alum, and salt. 

479, Mushrooms. No. 1. 

Stew them after peeled, with just water enough to pre- 
vent their sticking to the bottom of the pan. Shake them 
now and then, to prevent their buming. When tender, take

them tro, and put them in scalding vinegar, spiced with, 
mace, peppercorns, and, cloves, adding a little salt Bottle 
and cork tight, for long keeping. 

480. Mushrooms, No. 2. 

Take buttons, su^h only are fit for this use, and rub them 
with a sofl flannel and salt ; sprinkle on a little salt ; pot 
them into a stew pan with a little mace and pepper. As 
the liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them over 
a gentle fire, till all of it is dried in again. Then put as 
much vinegar into the pan as will cover them ; give it <me 
warming, and turn the whole into a glass or stone jar. They 
will keep two years, and they are delicious. 

481. Beets, 

Boil them sufficiently tender to' easily put a fork' through 
them ; put them into cold vinegar, with a httle salt, set them 
in a cool place, and stir them often to prevent any scum 
from rising. Beets should never be cut or scraped, till 
after boiling. 

482. Oysters and Clams, 

Take the oysters from the liquor ; rinsing off the pieces 
of shell, if any ; strain, boil, and skim it ; then put the 
oysters into the boiling liquor, with whole pepperqomsy 
spice, and mace, with a little salt, and boil all one minute. 
Take the oysters immediately out of the liquor, and let 
them cool ; add as much vinegar as oyster liquor, and boil 
fifteen minutes, and then turn it hot on the oysters. Keep 
them cool and air tight, and they will retain their natural 
color. 

Pickle clams in the same way, only boil them longer. 

483. Smelts, 

Take and clean two quarts of smelts ; pound, very fine, 
half an ounce of pepper, half of nutmeg, half of saltpetre, 
a quarter of an ounce of mace, and four ounces of common 
salt. Lay the smelts in rows in a jar, and between the 
layers strew the seasoning, with four or five bay leaves. 
Boil red wine, and pour over enough to cover them. When 
cold, tie a cover over them.

484. Mackerel, 
][)ivide each into four or six round pieces. To six large 
Ikiackerel, put one ounce of beaten pepper, three nutmegs, 
a little mace, and a handful of salt. Mix your salt and 
beaten spices together, make two or three holes in each 
piece of mackerel, and put your seasoning into them, rub- 
bing them over with it, and fry them brown in oil. When 
cold, put them in vinegar, and cover them with oil. If well 
covered, they will keep a great while, and they are 
excellent. 

485. Lemon Sirup*, 

Pare off the yellow part of the rind of {iresh lemons ; 
squeeze out the juice, strain it, and to a pint of it put a 
pound and three-quarters of sugar. Dissolve the sugar by 
a gentle heat, skim it till clear, then, adding the rinds, sim- 
mer gently eight or ten minutes, and strain it through a 
flannel bag. When cool^ boitle it, and seal the corks. 

486. Orange Sirup. 

Squeeze out and strain the juice of fresh oranges. To 
a pint of the juice add a pound and a half of sugar ; place 
it on a moderate fire ; put in the peel of the oranges after 
the sugar has dissolved, and set the sirup where it wilLboil 
slowly six or eight minutes ; then strain it through a flan- 
nel bag. Do not squeeze the bag while the sirup is pass- 
ing through, if you wish it clear. It is nice to flavor pies 
and puddiuigs. 

487. Blackberry Sirup. 

Procure the high blackberries that are ripe and nice ; 
simmer them over a moderate fire, till they break to pieces, 
and then strain them through a flannel cloth. To each 
pint of the liquor add a pound of white sugar, half an ounce 
of powdered cinnamon, a quarter of an ounce of powdered 
mace, and two teaspoonfuls of powdered cloves. Boil all 
fifteen minutes; strain it, jaaid when cool add to each 
pint of sirup, a wineglass of French brandy. Bottle, 
cork, and seal it, and keep it where cool. This, mixed in 
the i)^ODortioii of a wineglass of sirup to two<lbirds of a 



J 



160 SWESTHSAT8 AND JSLLISS. 

tumbler of cold water, is an excellent remedy for the dya» 
entery, and similar complaints. It is also a very graleM 
summer beverage. 

488. Elderberry Sirup. 

Take berries perfectly ripe ; wash and strain them ; put 
a pint of molasses to a pint of the juice ; boil it twenty 
minutes, stirring it constantly ; when cold, add to each 
quart, a pint of .French brandy. Bottle, and cork it tight. 
It is an excellent remedy for a tight cough. 

'^. 489. Molasses Sirup for Preserving, 

Mix eight pounds of light sugar-house or New Orleans 
molasses with eight pounds of water, and one of powdered 
charcoal ; boil all twenty minutes and strain it through a 
flannel bag. When lukewarm, put in the beaten whites of 
two eggs and set it on the fire ; as soon as it boils, take it 
from the fire and skim it till clear ; set it on the fire again 
and let it boil till it becomes a thick sirup, then strain it for 
use. This sirup does very well to preserve fruit in for 
common use. 

490. Sweetmeats, Drinks, ifc. 

The sugar used for the nicest sweetmeats should be the 
best double refined ; but if the pure, amber colored, sugar- 
house sirup, from the West Indies, can be gotten, it is far pre- 
ferable. It never ferments. The trouble is very much lessen- 
ed by having ready made sirup, in which it is only necessary 
to boil the fruit till clear. All delicate fruit should be done 
gently, and not allowed to remain over half an hour after 
it begins to simmer, before it is laid on dishes to cool. It 
must be put in the sirup again another half hour. Con- 
tinue so to do till it is sufficiently transparent. The pre- 
serves are less liable to boil to pieces than if done by one 
continued boihng.^ 
. In preparing sugar for sweetmeats, let it be quite dis- 

^ solved before you put it on the fire. If dissolved in water, 

allow a tumbler of water to a pound of sugar. If you boil 
the sugar before adding the fruit, it will be improved in 
cleames by passing it through a fiannel bag. Skim off the 
brown scum, all the time it is boiling. If sweetmeats are 



SWEETMEATS AND JELLIfiS. 161 

boiled too long, they lose their flavor and become dark. 
If not boiled long enough, they will not keep. Yod may 
know when jelly is done, by dropping a teaspoonful cold 
into a glass of water. If it spreads and mixes willi the 
water, it needs more boiling ; if it sinks to the bottom in a 
lump, it is done enough. Raspberry jelly needs most boil- 
ing of any kind. Black currant the least. 

Keep your sweetmeats cool and dry, in glass, China, or 
stone jars. Delicate preserves should be kept in small 
glasses or pots that will not hold more than one or two 
pounds ; the admission of air injures them. Glass is best. 

Cover the top, after sprinkling it over with sugar, with 
white paper dipped in hot clarified sugar. It is far better 
than rum or brandy. Over the whole confine a cover ao 
close as to entirely exclude the air 

491. To Clarify Sugar jhr Sweetmeats. 

Put your sugar into the preserving kettle, pour in as 
much cold water as you think may be wanted to cover the 
fruit to be preserved ; a gill to a pound of sugar ; beat the 
whites of eggs to a froth, allowing one egg to three pounds 
of sugar ; mix the whites with the sugared water ; set it on 
a slow fire, stirring the whole well together ; then set it 
where it will boil. As soon as it boils up well, take it from 
the fire, let it remain for a minute, then take off the scum ; 
set it back on the fire, and let it boil a minute, then take 
it off and skim it again. Repeat this operation till the sirup 
is clear ; and put the fruit in when it is cold. The fruit 
should not be crowded while doing ; and if there is not suffi- 
cient sirup to cover the fruit, take it out of the sirup, and put 
in more water, and boil it with the sirup before putting back 
the fruit. 

4d2. Directions for Making Sweetmeats, 

For preserving most kinds of fruit, a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit is sufiicient. Some kinds of fruit require 
more, and some will do with less, than their weight of su- 
gar. Good brown sugar, if clarified before putting in the 
fruit, does very well, for most kinds of fruit; and for family 
use, three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit 
does very well. The nicest white sugar needs not be clari- 



1 



163 SWEEtHEATd AND JBLLt^S* 

fied. All kinds of fire-proof war&j except iron ware, will 
do to preserve in. Enameled kettles of iron lined with 
china,, called preserve kettles, are best. The^ fruit shonld 
be turned out of the preserving kettle as soon as done, and 
set away. It should be looked to often^ to see that it does 
not ferment. Whenever it does, the sirup should be tamed 
off and scalded, and turned back while hot. 

493. Quince Marrhatade. 

The fruit should not.be over ripe — not melloWr Gather 
it on a dry day, and after a dry day. Some make this pre- 
serve, by covering the fruit and sugar close in a wide 
mouthed jar, and then setting the jai* in a kettle of cold 
water, and thus boiling the fruit till tender. This preserves 
its flavor. 

Wash and quarter the quinces, without paring ; set them 
on the fire with just sufficient water to stew them ; rub 
them through a sieve, when soft, and put to each pound of 
the pulp a pound of brown sugar ; set it on a few coals, 
stew slowly and stir it constantly. When it has simmered 
an hour, take out a little and cool it, if it then cuts smooth, 
it is sufficiently done. 

494. Preserved Quinces, 

Pare and core your quinces, taking out the parts that are 
knotty and defective ; cut them in quarters, or round slices ; 
put them in your preserving kettle ; cover them with the 
parings and a very little water ; lay a large plate over them 
to keep iri the steam, and boil them till they are tender. 
Take out the quinces, and strain the liquor tlurOugh a bag. 
To every pint of liquor, allow a pound of loaf sugm*. Boil 
the juice and sugar together about ten minutes, skimming it 
well ; put in the quinces and boil them gently twenty min- 
utes. When the sugar has completely penetrated diem, 
take them out, put them in a glass jar, and turn the juice 
over them warm. Tie them up, when cold, with pafer 
dipped in clarified sugar. 

495. Preserved Pine Apples, 
Having pared your pine apples, slice them, and take out 



^ 



J 



SWEETMEATS AND JELUBS. 168 

ike core from the middle of each slice. To each pomid of 
pine apple allow a pound of Joaf sugar. Mix half the su- 
gar irith the pine apple, and let them lie all night, to extract 
the juice ; then mix them with the remaining half of the su* 
gar, and put the whole iii a preserving kettle. Boil it till 
clear and tender, but not till the slices break. Skim it well ; 
set it away to cool ; put it into large glass jars ; and.ti6 over 
clarified paper. 

496. Preserved Currants. 

Take ripe currants, in their prime ; strip them off their 
stems, rejecting the bad ones ; make a sirup of sugar and 
very little water, allowing a pound of sugar to each pound 
of currants, and let them boil a few minutes. In a few 
days turn the sirup from them, scald it, and turn it back, 
while hot, on the currants. Preserved currants, mixed 
with water, are an excellent drink in fevers. Dried cur- 
rants are also good, made into a tea, for the same use. 

497. Preserved Strawberries. 

To each pound of picked strawberries, allow a pound 
of powdered loaf sugar. Strew half of the sugar over the 
strawberries, and let them stand in a cool place two or three 
hours ; put them in a preserving kettle, over a slow fire, and 
by degrees, strew on the rest of the sugar ; boil them fifteen 
or twenty minutes, and skim them well. Put them in wide 
mouthed bottles, and when cold, seal the cork's. If you 
wish to do them whole, take them carefully out of the sirup, 
(one by one,) while boiling, spread them to cool on large 
dishes, not letting the strawberries touch each other ; when 
cool, return them to the sirup, and boil them a Uttle longer. 
Repeat this several times. Keep the bottles in dry sand. 

Gooseberries, currants, cherries, grapes, and raspberries 
may be done in the same way. 

498. Preserved Pippins. 

Pare and core some of the finest ; put them in your pre- 
serving kettle, with some lemon peel and all the parings 
add a -very little water, cover closely, boil till tender, taking 
care that they do not bum ; take out the apples, spreading 
them on a large dish to cool ^ pour the liquor into a bag

uA Btnxa it; put it in your ketde wilji a pound of loaf so- 
ffar to a pint of juice, adding lemon juice to the taste ; boil 
wm slowly half an hour, or till they are quite soft and 
clear ; put them with the liquor into your jar, and when 
quite oold, tie them up with clariued, or with brandy paper. 
They are not intended for long keeping* 

Hard pears may be done in the same way, either whole 
or halved, flavoring them to the taste. 

499. Preserved Crab Apples, 

Wash the apples ; cover the bottom of your preserving 
kettle with grape leaves ; put them in ; place them over the 
fire, with a very little water, covering them closely ; sim- 
mer them gently till yellow ; take them out and spread 
them on a large dish to cool; pare and core tliem; put 
them again into your kettle, with fresh vine leaves under 
and over them, and a very little water, and hang them over 
the fire till they are green, but do not let them boil. When 
green, take them out ; allow a pound of loaf sugar to a 
pound of apple ; dissolve the sugar in just sufficient water ; 
put it over the fire, when dissolved ; boil and skim it ; put 
m your apples, and boil them till quite clear and tender. 
Put them in jars, turn the juice over them, and when cold, 
tie them up. 

500. Preserved Apples. ' 

Take equal weights of good brown sugar and of apples ; 
peel or wash, core, and chop the apples fine ; allow to every 
three pounds of sugar a pint of water ; dissolve, then boil 
the sugar pretty thick, skinuning it well ; add the apples, 
the grated peel of one or two lemons, and two or ^e|e 
pieces of white ginger ; and boil till the apples look clear 
and yellow. This will keep years. Crab apples done in 
this way, without paring, are next to cranberries. 

501. Transparent Apples. 

Dissolve and boil a pound of loaf sugar in a quart of wa- 
ter ; skim it ; put in select apples, pared, quarter^, ^nd 
cored, with the juice of a lemon, and let them boil, uncov- 
ered, till teQder. • 



SWBBTME^AT6 AND JBLLIES. 165 

'502. Good Fandly Apphsance, 

Take two quarts of water, a pint of molasses, an^ a root 
of race ginger, and boil all bard twenty minutes. Put in, 
wbile boiling, a peck of pared, quartered, and cored apples, 
and boil the whole moderately an hour and a half or two 
hours. 

503. Cider Apple^saitce, 

Boil down new sweet cider, till about as thick as molas- 
ses when cold, strain it through a sievej then, as soon as 
it boils, put in your apples, pared, quartered, and cored, and 
stew over a slow coal £re, till the fruit is perfectly tender. 

504. Black Butter. 

Allow to any kind of berries, stoned cherries, currants, 
^c, half their weight of sugar, and boil till reduced one- 
quarter. This is a healthful and nice substitute for butter 
for children, 

605. Preserved Peaches. 

Select the largest and nicest free-stone peaches, fully 
grown but not mellow, pare, halve, or quarter them ; crack 
the stones, take out and break the kernels ; put parings and 
all into your preserving kettle, with a very little water ; 
boil till tender ; then take out and spread the peaches on a 
large dish to cool. Strain the liquor through a sieve or bag ; 
next day, put to each pint of the Uquor a pound of loaf sugar. 
Put the liquor and sugar, dissolved, in^ the kettle with the 
peaches, and boil them slowly till they itre quite soft, skim- 
ming all the time ; tak^ the peaches out, put them into your 
jars, and turn the liquor over them warm. - When cold, tie 
them up with clarified paper. If boiled too long, they will 
be of a dark color. To preserve peaches whole, thrust out 
the stones with a skewer, and put in their place, after done, 
the kernels blanched. Broad, shallow, stone pots keep 
large fruit the best. 

If the juice is not wished very thick, boil the sugar alone, 
with only sufficient water to dissolve it, and skim it well ; 
then put in your fruit and juice, and boil till the fruit is 
completely penetrated with the sugar. 



166 8WBBTMSAT« IND JSLLIS8. 

506. PeacheSy Apricots^ and PlumSj preserved in Brandy. 

Take nice yellow peaches, not too mellow ; put them in 
a pot, ^nd cover them with weak cold lye ; take them out in 
one hour, and wipe them carefully with a soft cloth to get 
off the down and skin, and lay them in cold water ; take 
their weight in loaf sugar, adding enough water to cover the 
fruit ; boil and skim it ; put in«the peaches, and stew them 
from eight to fifteen minutes ; take them out and lay them 
on dishes to cool ; boil the sirup till reduced one half ; then 
tie up the peaches cold, covering them with equal quanti- 
ties of sirup and French brandy. Do apricots in the same 
way, only let them stew but five or six minutes. PlumB 
and cherries are excellent preserved in the same manner. 

507. Preserved Cranberries. 

Allow to each pound of washed cranberries, a pound of 
loaf sugar, dissolved in about a gill of water, first boiling 
the sugar and skimming it well about ten minutes, then add- 
ing the cranberries. Boil slowly, till they are quite soft 
and of a fine color. Put them up warm. When cold, tie 
them up. Common glass tumblers are very convenient for 
preserved small fruits and jellies. 

508. Preserved Gages. 

Take equal weights of gages and sugar; dissolve the su- 
gar in just sufficient water to cover the plums ; boil them 
slowly in the sirut^n minutes ; turn them into a dish, and 
let them remain four or five days ; boil them again, till the 
sirup appears to have entered the plums ; put them up ; in 
a week^ turn the sirup from them, scald it, turn it over them 
hot ; and, when cold, tie them up. 

509. Preserved Damsons. 

Allow for every pound of damsons three-quarters of a 
pound of powdered sugar ; put alternate layers of fruit and 
sugar into jars, or well-glazed earthen pots ; tie over strong 
paper, or cloth, and set them in the oven afler the bread is 
drawn, and let them stand till the oven is cold. The next 



SWEETMEATS AND JELLIES 167 

day, strain off the sirup, boil it till thick, turn it warm over 
the fruit in jars, and, when cold, tie up. 

510. Preserved Pumpkin, 

Cut slices from a- nice, high-colored pumpkin, and cut 
the slices into chips about the thickness of a dollar ; have 
the chips of an equal size, six inches in length, and an inch 
broad. Put to each pound of fruit a pound of loaf sugar. 
Pare off and lay aside the yellow rind of some lemons ; 
squeeze out the juice, allowing a gill to a pound of pump- 
kin. Put the pumpkin into a broad pan, laying the sugar jP^ 
among it ; turn the lemon juice over it ; cover the pan, and 
let the whole set all night. In the morning, put the whole 
in a i»reserving pan, and boil, skimming it well, till the 
pumpkin becomes clear and crisp, but not till it breaks. It 
should have the appearance of lemon candy ; and, if liked, 
some lemon peel, cut in Very fine pieces, may be added. 
About half an hour's boiling is suJSicient. When done, take 
out the pumpkin, spread it on a large dish, and strain the 
sirup through a bag ; put it into jars, turn the sirup over it, 
and tie up. It is very nice ; may be eaten without cream, 
or laid on puff paste shells after they are baked. 

611. Preserved Grapes, 

Allow a poimd of sugar to a pound of grapes ; squeeze 
out the pulp, and boil it till quite soft ; strain it through 
cloth ; to this add your sugar and clarify it ; then throw in 
your skins, and boil till thick enough to please. 

512. Preserved Pears, 

Allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a JK)und of 
p'sars. Clarify the sugar, if brown is used, then put in the 
fruit, and boil it till tender. A few pieces of ginger, or fine ^ 

ginger tied up in bags, may be boiled with the pears, to fla- 
vor them. Vergouleuse and choke pears are the best for 
preserving. 

513. Winter BeU Pears, 

Take some of the nicest, put them in an iron pot, filling 
it about half full, cover them with water, and boil them. 
After giving them a thorough boiling, and making them ten-

der, let them steam over a slow fire, covering the^ pot close, 
to confine the steam, fire or six hoars, till but just sufficient 
juice to prevent their burning. If done right, they will be 
as red as cranberry preserves, retaining all the rich natural 
flavor of the pear, and wiU require care in taking up to pre- 
vent their breaking. They are idee, thus plainly cooked ; 
but if prefenedia little molasses may be added toward the 
last. 

614. Preserved Cherries. 

Tako cherries before dead ripe ; allow a pound of white 
sugar to a poimd of fruit ; dissolve and boil the sugar, hav- 
ing it thick, put in the cherries with the stems on, and let 
them boil till transparent. Tie them up in glass jars. 
The carnation and common light red, if done carefully, will 
be so transparent the stones may be seen through them. 

To preserve them without the stones, take such as are 
very ripe, push out the stone carefully with a darning nee- 
dle, make sirup of the juice, and then boil the cherries to a 
thick consistency. 

515. Preserved Gooseberries. 

Take gooseberries before ripe ; allow a pound of sugar 
to a pound of fruit. Stew them till quite clear, and till the 
sirup becomes thick. They make nice tarts. 

516. Preserved Tomatoes. 

Take tomatoes quite small and green, and if fully ripe 
they are nice ; put them in cold clarified sirup, with one 
orange, cut in slices, to every two pounds of tomatoes ; sim- 
mer them gently two or three hours, allowing equal weights 
of sugar and tomatoes, and more than barely enough water 
to cover the tomatoes, for the sirup. 

Another very nice method of preserving them is, allow 
two fresh lemons to three pounds of the tomatoes ; pare ofif 
only the yellow part of the rind ; squeeze out the juice, and 
mix the rind and juice with enough cold water to cover the 
tomatoes, and add a few peach leaves and powdered ginger 
tied up in bags. Boil aU gently together, forty-five minutes, 
take out the tomatoes, strsiin the liquor, and put to it a pound 
and a half of white sugar, for each pound of tomatoes ; put 



SWSSTXIITS AND nU.IB8. 199 

in die tomatoes, and boil them gendy till the simp af^ears 
to have penetrated them. In about a veek, turn off the 
sirup, scald it, and tnm it back. Thus preserved, tomatoes 
appear like West India sweetmeata. 

517. Tomato Marmalade. 
Take full grown tomatoes while quite green, c 
sterna, stew diem till wit, rub them through a siet 
pulp on the fire, seasoned highly with salt, pepper 
cloves, and garlic, if liked, and stew sU together 
It is excellent for seasoning gravies &c., and kee 

518. Cyndings, or Mod Citron. 

Cnt the cymlings, (Virginia squashes,) in rings 
and scrape them ; put them iu strong salt and we 
days, then in fair water one day, changing the w 
eral times ; soak them in alum water one hour ; ue up 
oyster shells in a cloih and boil them with the cymlinge till 
the fruit is tender, then take it up and put it back into the 
alum water. Allow for the sirup, a pound and ^h^ of 
loaf sugar to a pound of cymhngs ; boil in it some tresh 
lemon cut in slices, and spices to the taste. When cold, 
rinse the cymlings, and boil them about three-qnaTters of an 
hour. These are good eaten as other sweetmeats, or for 
cake, instead of citron. 

Preserve watermelon rinds in the same manner. Tie 
up with clarified or brandy paper. 

519. Raspberry, Blaeberry, and Strawberry Jam. 
For each pound of fruit allow a pound of sugar ; make 
alternate layers of sugar and berries in your preserving 
dish ; let them remain half an hour, then boil them slowly 
about half an hour, stining them frequently. Put a little in 
a cup, and set it in, a dish of cold water for trial. Boil till 
it becomes the consistency of thick jelly. 

530. Calf's Feet Jelly. 
Take four scalded feet, perfectly clean ; boil them iuM 
four quarts of water till reduced to one, or till they' are "^f^l 
tender ; take them from the lire and let them remain^jdl

170 Sweetmeats and jellies. 

SerTectly cold ; then take off all the fat, and scrape off th« 
regs that stick to the jelly. Put it in a preserving kettio, 
and place it on a slow fire. On melting, take it from the 
fire ; mix with it, half a pint of white wine, the juice and 
grated rind of two fresh lemons, and a. stick of cinnamon, 
or blade of mace. Wash and wipe dry six eggs ; stir the 
!s, heaten to a froth, into the jelly when cold ; bruise 
hells and add thoin ; then set it on a few coals ; when 
iweeten to the taste. Let all boil slowly fifteen min- 
without stirring it ; then suspend a Hannel bag, and 
lo jelly drain through it into a pitcher or deep dish. 
9 not clear, wash the bag and pass it through till it is 
inui^ctly so. Do not squeeze the bag. When transparent, 
turn it into glasses, and set them, if the weather is hot, into 
cold water, and keep them in a cool place. It will keep 
but a few days in warm weather. 

Some take eight calf's feet, a pint of white wine, three 
lemons, the whites of six eggs, half an ounce of cinnamon, 
half a pound of loaf sugar, with only thiee quarts of water, 
and proceed in a similar way, adding two spoonMa of 
French brandy, and reduce the whole to one quart. 

.A knuckle of veal, and sheep's feet make a nice jelly 
When jelly is perfectly congealed, dip the mould an instant 
into boiling water, to loosen it. 

521 . Lemon Jelly. 
Set on a slow fire a pint of water, with one ounce of rins- 
ed isinglass, in small pieces, and the rind of six lemons ; stir 
constantly till the isinglass is dissolved ; add a pint of lemon 
juice, and sweeten it to the taste, with loaf sugar. Boil 
all, four or five minutes ; color with the tincture of safiron, 
and pass it through a flannel bag, without' squeezing it. Fill 
your jelly glasses with it when partly cool. 

ft 522. Strawberry, Raspberry, and Blackierry Jelly. 

The jellies of all these berries are made in a similar 

manner. Take the benies when ripe, and such as are 

^|)rime, mash them, and let them drain through a flannel bag 

Vwithout squeezing it. Put to a pint of the juice, a pound 

i^4fel<^f sugar and one third of the white of an egg; set it

on the fire ; on boiling np w^, remove it from the fire and 
skim it clear ; set it back ; if more scmn rises, remove it 
from the fire again, and skim itofif. Boil till it becomes a 
jelly. If, when cold, on dropping it into a tumble|^of cold 
water it falls to the bottom in solid form, it is jellied. Tie 
up with clarified or brandy paper. 

623. Cranberry y Grape, and Citrrantj Jelly, 

Wash, and drain the fruit till nearly dry ; put it in an .^P 
earthen jar ; put the jar in a kettle of water ; set the kettle 
where the water will boil, taking care that none of it gets 
into the jar. When the fruit breaks, pour it into a flannel bag 
to drain, without squeezing it. When strained, add to each 
pint of juice, a pound and a half of white sugar, and half 
the beaten white of an egg. Boil the sirup gently, takiitg 
it back from the fire as fast as any scum rises, and skim it 
clear. \fteT boiling fifteen or twenty minutes, drop a tea- 
spoonful of it, cold, into a tumbler of water, to ascertain if 
it is jelly. Jellies are improved by being set in the sun a 
few days. Currant jelly is best made of equal quantities 
of white and red currants. The juice of black currants re- 
quires but about half the sugar, and half the time, to boil it 
that the red does. t 

524. Apple and Quince Jelly. Seepage 194. 

Crab apples make the nicest apple jelly. Wash them, 
cut out the defects, the stem, the blossom end, and the 
seeds, quartering the apples, but neither pare them, nor 
take out the hulls ; lay them in your preserving kettle ; and 
put to them just sufficient water to cover them. Boil till 
soft, but not till they break. Drain off the water through 
a colander ; mash the apples with the back of a spoon ;'put 
them in a jelly bag, place a deep dish under it, and squeeze 
out the juice. To every pint of juice, allow a pound of loaf 
sugar ; boil slowly, skimming it well, about ten or twenty 
minutes, or until it is a jelly. Dip it out while boiling, with 
a silver spoon, into your tumblers and moulds ; cover with 
a prepared paper, and tie another paper close over the glass 
Quince jelly is made in the same way. Pippins and bell 
flowers make good jelly. Add lemon peel if you like* ^

Common drinks. 



525. Molasses Candy. 

Take two quarts- of West India molasses, one pounil of 
brown sugar, and the juice of two large lemons, or a tea- 
spoonful of strong essence of lemon; mix, and l»oil tlie 
molasses and sugar three hours, over a moderate fire, (when 
done it will cease boiling, and be crisp when cold.) While ^ 
boiling, stir it frequently, and see it does not burn. After 
boiling two hours and a half, stir in the lemon juice. It 
will be improved by grating in the yellaw part of the rind 
80 fine as not to be visible when boiled. If the lemon is 
put in too soon, all the taste will be boiled out. When it 
is quite done, butter a square tin pan, and turn the mixture 
in to cool. If you prefer the candy with ground nuts, roast 
a quart of them, shell and blanch them, and stir them in 
gradually, a few minutes before you take it from the fire. 
Almonds may be blanched, cut in pieces, and stirred in raw, 
when the sugar and molasses have just done boiling. If 
you wish to make it yellow, take some out of the tin pan 
while it is yet warm, and pull it out into a thick string, be^ 
tween the thumb and fore-finger of both hands. Extend 
your arms widely as you pull the candy backwards and 
forwards. By repeating this a long time, it will gradually 
become of a light yellow color, and of a spongy consistency. 
When it is quite yellow, roll it into sticks, twist two sticks 
together, and cut them off smoothly at both ends. Or you 
may variegate it by twisting together a stick that is qmte 
yellow and one that remains brown. 



526. Coffee, 

Old Java and Mocha are the best kinds. Coffee should 
be dried in an iron pot, over a moderate fire, for some hours 
before it is roasted. Hang the pot so high as not to bum 
it. After drying three or four hours, place it on a hot 'bed 
of coals, and stir it constantly until roasted enough, which 
is determined by biting one of the lightest colored kernels. 
If brittle, pronounce the whole done. Put into two or three 
pounds a bit of butter as big as a walnut, before taking it 
off. Box it tight, immediately, to keep in the steam. A 
coffee roaster is the best thing to roast coffee in. ^ It con- 
'fines the fine aromatic flavor of the coffee, which otherwise

escapes with the steam. For good, common cofiee, allow 
firom one to two spoonfuls, ground, to a pint of water. Pour 
the water on boiling hot, and boil it in a coffee pot, from 
twenty tdPtwenty^five minutes. It will not taste fresh and 
lively, if boiled longer. Let it stand, after removed from 
the fire, four or five minutes to settle, then turn it off care- 
fully from the grounds, into an urn or coflfee pot? When 
the coffee is put on the fire to boil, put a piece of isinglass, 
or fish skin, the size of a dime, into it, or the white and 
shell of an egg, for two quarts of coffee. Many dislike to 
fine coffee with fish skin, thinking it imparts an unpleasant 
taste ; but it wiH notj if prepared properly. Take the skin 
from mild codfish that has not been soaked, as soaking de- 
stroys its effects ; rinse it in cold water, and dry it perfectly, 
it may be done in the oven after drawing the bread ; when 
dry, cut it into pieces of the size of a dime, and keep them 
in a paper bag for use. Put one of these dime-pieces into 
from a quart to two quarts of coffee, when you set^^on the 
fire to boil. If you cannot get cream for your coffee, boil 
the cofifee with less water, and weaken it with boiling milk, 
when served out in cups. - 

Some cooks say, allow two spoonfuls of fresh roasted 
coffee for each person ; grind it just before making ; ^t it 
in a basin, and break into it the white, yolk, and shell of 
one egg ; mix it up with a spoon to the consistency of a 
thick pulp ; put warm, not boiling, water in the coffee pot ; 
place, and let it stand on the fire, till it boils up and breaks 
three times. Then take it off and let it stand a few min- 
utes, and it will be as clear as amber, and the egg will give 
it a rich taste. 



527. French Method of Preparing Coffee, 

Divide the^ quantity to be roasted into two parts ; roast 
one part in a coffee roaster, turn it constantly, till the cofifee 
is the color of dried almonds, and has lost one eighth of its 
weight. Roast the other part, till the color of chestnuts, 
and it has lost one-fifth of its weight. Roast and grind 
your cofifee the day it is to be used ; mix the two parts, and 
grind them in a cofifee mill. To two ounces of ground cofifee 
put four cups of cold water ; draw this ofif, and set it one

side. Put to the same coffee, three cvips of boiling water; 
draw this off and add it to the cold infusion. When wanted, 
heat it quickly, in a silver coffee pot. Do not let it boil ; 
the perfume will be lost by evaporation. Do not make the 
coffee in a tin vessel. Make it in China, delft-Hare, or m 
silver. 

528. Coffee Cream. 

Mix three cups of nice clear coffee, and sugar to the 
taste, and boil with a pint of cream till reduced about one 
third. 

529. Cecoa Shdk. 

Put your shells soaking over night ; then boil them in 
the same water in the morning. They are hepllMiil and

530. Chocolate. 

All^ to each square, or spoonful, of fine scraped choco- 
late, about a pint of water ; boil from fifteen to twenty min- 
utes, then add cream, or milk, and sugar to the taste, and 
boil it, uncovered, about ten minutes longer. 

41 631. Tea. 

Scald the tea-pot, and put in a teaspoonful to a person, if 
the tea is strong ; if it is a weak kind, put in more ; turn 
on just sufiicient boiling water to cover your tea, and let it 
steep — ^green tea, Rve or six minutes, (if longer it will not 
be lively,) and black tea, ten or twelve minutes. Fill up 
your tea-pot with boiling water, on carrying it to the table ; 
and keep your tea-kettle boiling, to fill up your tea-pot as 
it may want — careful not to have smoky tea. Black tea is 
more healthful than green. Hyson and soucHong, half and 
half, is a pleasanter and more healthful beverage, for such as 
drink strong tea, than green alone. 

532. Eau Sucre. 

Sweeten boiling water with sugar to your taste. Tlus 
beverage is considered soporific ; is good for weak n^res; 
and is much used by French ladies.

Mix one quart of strained currant juice, with two quarts 
of water, and three pounds of sugar. After stirring the 
whole tocher, let it rest twenty-four hours ; then skim, 
and set it in a cool place, where it will ferment slowly. At 
the end of three or four days, or when fermentation has 
about ceased, close up the barrel tight, which should be full. 
When it becomes clear^ bottle it. 

534. Grape Wine, 

To each gallon of , bruised perfectly ripe grapes, add a 
gallon of water, and let the whole stand a week ; then draw 
off the. liquor, and put to every gallon three pounds of lump 
sugar. When fermentation, in a temperate situation, ii 
about over, stop it close. In about six months bottle it, 

535. To Mull Wine. m^ 

Put a teaspoonful of powdered cloves and cinnamon to a 
pint of water ; place it where it will boil; then separate the 
yolks and whites of three eggs, and beat \;l^ yolks with a 
spoonful of powdered sugar. When the water boils, turn 
it on the yolks and sugar ; add a pint of wine, and pou]|^e 
beaten whites of the eggs over the whole. 

• 536. Ginger Wine, 

To threo gallons of water, put three pounds of sugar, 
and four ounces of race ginger^ washed perfectly clean ; 
boil ihem one hour, and then strain through a sieve. When 
lukewarm, put it in a cask with three lemons cut in slices, 
and half a pint of beer yeast. Mix it well together, and 
make the cask tight. After fermenting about a week, or 
till clear, bottle it. It' may then be used in about ten days

few minutes ; strain it through a very fine sieire till quite 
smooth, and free from the almonds ; and serve it up ^ther 
cold or lukewarm, in handled glasses. 

538. Sherbet 

Boil in three pints of water, six or eight stalks of green 
rhubarb, and four ounces of- raisins or figs ; when the wa- 
ter has boiled about half an hour, strain it, and mix it with 
a teaspoonful of rose-water, and orange or lemon sirup to 
the taste. Drink it cold. 

539. Cherry JSkrub. 

Pick ripe Morello cherries from the stem ; put them in 
an earthen pot ; place that in an iron pot of water ; boil till 
the juice is extracted ; strain it through a cloth thick enough 
to r<lfl^ ^he pulp, and sweeten it to your taste. When 
perfe^^ clear, bottle it, sealing the cork. By first putting 
a gill of brandy into each bottle, it will keep through the 
summer. It is delicious mixed with water. 

^ 540. Currant Shrub, 

To a pound of sugar, add a pint of strained currant juice; 
boil it gently eight or ten minutes, skimming it well ; take it 
off; and when lukewarm, add half a gill of brandy to eve- 
ry pint of shrub. Bottle tight. 

541. Raspberry Shrub. 

Put ond quart of vinegar to three quarts of ripe raspber- 
ries ; after standing a day, strain it, sidding to each pint a 
pound of sugar, and skim it clear, while boiling about^alf 
an hour. Put a wineglass of brandy to each pint of the 
shrub, when cool. Two spoonfuls of this mixed with a 
tumbler of water, is an excellent drink in fevei^.

spoonfuls of brandy, and soak the rind Of the lemon in it. 
Let all stand one day, fre<}«ently stining up the lemon juice 
and sugar.. Next day pour off the sirup, and mix it with 
the brandy and lemon rinds. Keep it under sealed corks, 
in dry sand, in a cool place. 

543. Lemonade. 

Mix the juice of twa lemons with a pint of water, sweet- 
ening to the taste. Some like nutmeg grated on it, or 
some of the squeezed lemon cut in it. 

M4. Common Beer, 

Allow at the rate Of two gallons of water to a handful of 
hops, a little fresh spruce, or sweet fern, and a quart of 
bran ; bbil it two or three hours ; strain it through, a sieve ; 
stir in, while hot, a teacup of molasses to each gribn of 
liquor ; let it stand till lukewarm ; turn it into a clRn bar- 
rel ; add a pint of good yeast to the barrel ; shake it well 
together, and it may be used next day. 

545. Spring Beer. 

Take a small bunch of sweet fern, sarsaparilla, winter- 
green, sassafras, prince's pine, cumfrey root, burdock root, 
nettle root, Solomon's seal, spice bush, and black birch ; 
boil part, or all of them, in three or four gallons of water, 
with two or three ounces of hops, and two or three raw 
potatoes, pared and cut in slices. Their strength is bet- 
ter extracted by boiling in two waters, for when Uie liquor is 
saturated with the hops, it will rather bind up the roots than 
extract their juices. Boil the roots five or six hours ; strain 
the liquor ; and add a quart of molasses to three gallons 
of beer. To have the beer very rich, brown half a pound 
of bread and put it into the liquor. If the liquor is too thick, 
dilute it with cold water. When lukewarm, put in a pint of 
fresh lively yeast. Place it in a temperate situation, cover- 
ed, but not so closely as to retard fermentation. After fer 
mentation, bottle it close, or keep it in a tight keg.

To a gallon of water, add a sliced lemon, a spoonful of 
ginger, half a pint of yeast, and sugar enough, to make it 
quite sweets 

547. Hop Beer, 

Turn five quarts of water on six ounces of hops ; boil 
three hours ; strain off the liquor ; turn on four quarts more 
of water, and twelve spoonfuls of ginger, and boil the hops 
three hours longer ; strain, and mix it with the other liquor, 
and stir in two quarts of molasses. Brown very dry half 
a pound of bread, and put in — ^rusked bread is bestr Pound 
it fine, and brown it in a pot, like coffee. Afler cooling to 
be about lukewarm, add a pint of new yeast that is free 
from salt. Keep the beer covered, in a temperate situa- 
tion, till fermentation has ceased, which is known by the 
settling of the froth ; then turn it into a keg or bottles, and 
keep^llin a cool place. 

548. Ginger Beer, 

. Turn two gallons of'boiling water on two pounds of brown 
sugar, or to a quart of molasses, one and a half ounces of 
cream of tartar, and the same of ginger ; stir them well, and 
put it into a cask. When milkwarm, put in half a pint of 
good yeast, stopping the cask close, and shaking it ivell. 
Bottle it in about twenty four hours. In ten days it wiU 
sparkle like Champaigne. One or two lemons sliced in, 
wOl much improve it. It is excellent in warm weather.

fit for use. 

550. Spruce Beer, 

Boil one handful of hops, and two of the chips of sassa- 
fras root, in ten gallons of water ; strain it, and turn on,

551. Beer of Essential Oils, 

m 

Mix two quarts of boiling water with a pint and a half 
of molasses ; stir in five quarts of cold water, ten drops of 
the oil of sassafras, ten of spruce, fifteen of wintergreen, 
and a.teaspoonful of the essence of ginger; when luke- 
warm, turn in half a pint of fresh lively yeast. After fer- 
mented, bottle and cork it, and keep it where cool. It may 
be used in two or three days. 

552. Essence $f Lemon. 

Turn ^adually two ounces of strong rectified spirit on a 
drachm of the best oil of lemons. JBut the best way o£^b- 
taining the essence of lemon peel, is to rub all the yellow 
part of the peel off, with lumps of white sugar, an^scrape . 
off the surface of the sugar into a preserving pot, as fast as 
it becomes saturated with the oil of the lemon. Press the 
sugar close, and cover it tight. A little of this sugar im- 
parts a fine fiavor to puddings, pies, and cakes. This is 
the preferable mode of obtaining and preserving Ihe essence 
of lemon. You have the fine aromatic flavor of the peel, 
without the alloy of the spirit. 

553. Essence of Ginger, 

Grate, and put into a quart of French brandy, three ounces 
of fresh ginger, with the yellow part of the rind of a fresh 
lemon ; shake it up well, and daily, ten days, when it may 
be used. It is nice for flavoring many kinds of sweetmeats ; 
and a little of it mixed with water, or put on a piece of su- 
gar, subserves all the purposes of ginger tea, and is far more 
palatable. 

554. Rose-water, 

On a dry day, gather fragrant, full-blown roses ; pick 
off the leaves ; to each peck put a quart of water ; put the 
whole in a cold still, and set the still on a moderate fire — 
liie slower they are distilled, the better Will be the rose- 
water. Bottle the water immediately after it is distilled

555. Aromatic Vinegar, 

Mix with ft spoonful of vinegar powdered chalk suffi- 
cient to destroy its acidity ; let it settle ; turn off the vine- 
gar from the chalk with care, and dry it. To purify an 
infected room, put in a few drops of sulphuric acid. The 
fumes arising from it will purify a room where there has 
been any infectious disorder. In using it, be very carefid 
not to inhale the fumes, or to soil your garments with the 
acid. It will corrode whatever it touches. 

556. To Extract the Essential OilofFtdvsers, 

Take a quantity of fresh, fragrant leaves, both the stalk 
and flower leaves ; cord very thin layers of cotton, and dip 
thejn in fine Florence oil ; put alternate layers of the cot- 
ton and leaves in a glass jar, or large^ tumbler ; sprinkle a 
very l^tle fine salt on each layer of the flowers ; cover the 
jar close, and place it in a window exposed to the sun. 
In two weeks a fragrant oil may be squeezed out of the cot- 
ton. Rose leaves, nugnonette, and sweet scented clover, 
make nice perfumes. 

557. Cologne Water,

Cure Sore Throat, 

Apply freely, daily, or every time of washing the face, 
cold water under the chin and about the neck. The efifect 
has been witnessed. It is a sure preventive. The tooth* 
ache too will be a rare visitor, and probably a total stranger. 
Wash your children daily and thoroughly in cold water, as 
the best preventive of colds. 

For sore throat, drink a tumbler of molasses and water, 
half and half, on going to bed, bathing the feet and applying 
mustard drafts ; rub your throat with a mixture of sweet or 
goose oil and spirits of turpentine ; then wear fiannel. Tym 
your woollen stocking, and apply the foot part next to the 
throat, when going to bed, is recommended.

The following is also good for the rh^umatisni. Put a gill 
df gymson seed into a pint bottle ; fill the bottle with the 
fine chips of a pitch pine knot ; then fill it with strong alco- 
hol. In three days the virtue of the chips and of the seed 
will be extracted, the alcohol turning of a greenish coldf » 
Bathe the parts affected a few times, and it will destroy the 
pain. A detiodtion of wermwobdj or the bruised leaves^ 
iBoistened and af^ied, is a good appli(iation for a bruise or 
sprain. 

570. For Lax bowels. 

Take ten grains of salt of tartar, ten drops of laudanum, 
and twenty drops of the essence of peppermint, in warm 
water. Ot^ put to & gill of Water a Small tablespoonfui of

•and cold water enough to make a thick batter. Stir it into 
a pint of boiling water, if the gruel is liked thick ; if thin, 
into more water ; boil about , forty ^linutes, putting in a 
little salt and stirring it frequently. Take it off the fire, 
and add a little salt and butter, and pour it on small pieces 
of toasted bread. 

580. Barley Water. 

Boil till soU two ounces of barley in two quarts of jMMir. 
Pearl barley is preferred. Strain and mix it with eflngh

quart ; strain and use it. 

581. Caudle, 

To rice or water gruel made as above and strained, add 
half a wineglass of Wine, brandy, or ale ; and season it with 
loaf sugar and nutmeg. 

582. Wine^ Vinegar, and other Wheys. 

Stir into a pint of boiling milk, two glasses of wine ; boil 
it one minute ; take it from the fire ; let it stand till the curd 
has settled ; then pour ofi* the whey, and sweeten it with 
loaf sugar. Vinegar, cream of tartar, lemon, nkustard seed, 
and aluip whey, are all made in like manner. 

583. Arrow Root Custard, 

Stir well into a pint of boiling milk, a spoonful of arrow- 
root mixed smooth with a little cold milk ; boil it three or 
four minutes ; when cool, stir in two well-beaten eggfi^ 
sweeten it to the taste, and add a little nutmeg ; let all boil

584. Tkofaugkwort jSittefs. . 

Make a strong tea of thoroughwort ; strain it ; wheli 
cool, put to two quarts of it half a pint of French brandy, 
the peel of two or three fresh oranges, cut in small bits, and 
six bunches of fennel or smellag^ seed. Turn the tea and 
brandy on the peel and seed in a bottle, and cork it tight 
The bitters will keep good a long time ; they are excellent 
for bilious complaints, and can often be taken when thor- 
oughwort tea will not suit the stomach. Put a wineglass 
of the bitters to a tumbler of i^ater, adding a little sugar at 
t|^time of drinking them* 

585. Stomackit Tincttite. 

Bruise one ounce of dried bitter orange peel, with two of 
Peruvian bark ; steep them two weeks in a pint of j»roof 
spirit, shaking up the bottle once or twice <laily. Let it 
remain quiet two days, then turn it off carefully into another 
bottle. A teaspoonful^ in a wineglass 6( water, is a good 
tonic. 

586. Tapioca Jelly. 

Rinse foui^ spoonfuls of tapioca thoroughly, covering it 
with cdld water ; sdak it ^ve hours. Put a pint of cold 
water on the fire ; when it boils, mash and stir up the 
tapioca that is in water, and mix it with the boihng water ; 
simmer all gently with a stick of cinnamon or mace ; when 
thick and clear, mix two spoonfuls of white sugar with half 
a spoonful of lemon juice, and half a glass of white wine ;

Soak four ounces of sago 'in cold water half au hour, 
after thoroughly rinsed ; pour it off; turn on a pint and a 
lialf of fresh cold water ; soak it half an hour ; then boil it 
slowly with a stick of cinnamon, stirring it constantly. 
When of a thick consistency, add a glass of wine, and loaf 
sugar to the taste. Boil it five minutes, and turn it into 
cups. 

589. Beef Tea, 

Boil a pound of fresh lean beef ten minutes ; cut it in 
small bits ; pour on a pint of boiling water ; let it steep, 
where warm, half an hour ; then strain and season the tea 
with salt and pepper. This, though a quick way, is i^jL^o 
good as the following, when the stomach can bear wm a 
little liquid : — Cut the beef, quite free of fat, into small bits ; 
fill a junk bottle with them, cork it tight, immerse it in a 
kettle of lukewarm water, and boil it four or five hours. 
In fhis way, you obtain the juices of the meat unalloyed 
with water. A spoonful of this, is as nourishing as a tea- 
cup of the other. 

590. For the Dysentery. 

Bruise one ounce of rhubarb, two drachms of English 
saffron, two of cardamom seed, and a large nutmeg ; add to 
them a pint of best French brandy ; set tbe bottle, loosely 
cork'ed, in a pot of cold water ; heat the water over a mod- 
erate fire quite hot, and keep it hot twelve hours, without 
boiling. It is then fit for use. Take, on going to bed, one 
spoonful — a teaspoonful for a child. / 

591. For Weakness, 

Put to a pint of best port wine, one ounce of steel filings* 
and one ounce of cinnamon. Place the bottle twenty-four 
hours in the corner, often shaking it : — ^take in the day, 
three teaspoonfuls, one at a time. 

592. To prevent the Lockjaw. 

As this is often caused by treading on a nail or pin, and 
subsequent neglect — forthwith bind on a rind of salt pork. 
If the foot swell, bathe it in strong wormwood tea, and bind 
on another pork rind : — ^rest till healed. Or, Boajf. the limb

wet with lye. Renew it when cold. 

593. For the Ear Ache. 

As this is generally caused by a cold — steatn the ear ovet 

hot herbs, bathe the feet, and put cotton wool wet with 

sweet oil and paregoric into the ear. Or, best and safest; 

put the heart of a roasted onion, warm, into the ear, bathing 

A the feet, and applying drafts. 

594. Infallible Cure for the Tooth Ache, 

Pulverize and mix in equal quantities, alum and cooimon 
salt ; wet a small piece of cotton, and causing the mixture 
to aahere, place it in the hollow tooth. A sensation of cold- 
ness will be produced at first,- which will gradually subside, 
and with li/ihB torment of the tooth ache. As an approz- 
imatk)n to a cure, apply a ginger poultice, on flannel, when 
going to bed. Some recommend the wetting of the flannel 
in hot vinegar. Hot vinegar applications are efficacious for 
removing pains in variety ; but they are hazardous. Very 
seripus results have been caused by the application of vin- 
egar. If used at all, use it with the greatest caution. 

695. For the Sick Head Ache. 

Every other night, for a while, soak the feet on going to 
bed, in hot water half an hour, adding hot water occasion- 
ally during the time, so as to have the water hotter at the 
time of taking them out than when putting them in, to pre- 
vent the blood rushing back to the head. Retiring imme- 
idiately, drink a tumbler of hot strong ginger tea, and apply 
a stone jug of hot water to the feet. Some recommend the 
app^ation of a hop poultice to the head, and the use of this 
prescription at any hour of the day. 

596. For the Heart-ache or Heart-hum. 

For the one, keep a conscience void of offense :* for the 
other chew magnesia or chalk, or drink a tumbler of cold 
milk.

bing it in cold water ; eorer it with -cold water, and steep it 
two hours ; then bruise or cut it, and turn on boiling water, 
and steep it three or four days, and turn off the water by 
pressure. Put the liverwort into a quart of fresh water, and 
reduce it by boiling to about a pint. 4.fter strained and 
cooled, it is free from any bitter taste, and makes a thick 
mucilage. It is palatable, by adding sugar and lemon acid, 
or white wine, where wine may be used ; and it is an excel- 
lent demulcent nutriment in dysentery, consumption, and in 
conyalescence from acute diseases, especially after the 
hooping cough, in which case its bitter need be but partially 
extracted. 

598. Bread Water. 

Brown thoroughly thin pieces of bread on both sides, 
without burning it, and turn boiling water over if'and let 
it cool. 

599. Cooling Drinks, 

Turn boiling water on preserves, roasted sour apples, or 
lemons sliced ; or boil lemon juice in sugar and water. 

6(H), Licorice, Flaxseed, Baneset, Pennyroyal, Mint, Balm, 

and other Teas, 

Put the seeds or herbs into a pkBher ; turn on boiling 
water; cover and set it near the fire till sufficiently strong. 
Mint tea is good for allaying nausea and vfimiting. Seep, 1 94. 

601. For a Cut. 

For a slight cut, only put on dry linen lint, bandaging it 
moderately tight. Ufliting the lips with an adhesive plas» 
ter, or by stiching, will make a cut heal more readily. In 
slight cuts, the lint need not be removed. In others, after 
two or three days, a piaster of basilicon, or some other 
salve may be needed. Apply the salve, spread on lint, or 
a fine rag, direcuy ; or over a thin dressing of dry lint. 

602. Madder Red, and Crimson Dyes. 

For one pound of goods, allow three ounces of alum, one 
of cream of tartar, and eight of madder. Bring to a scald- 
ing heat, three gidlons of water in a brass ketUe : add the 



190 CQMHOK I>ir£8« 

alum and tartar ; let it boil ; then pot in the goods, and bofl 
them two hours. Take out and rinse them in clear water. 
Empty the kettle ; put in again three gallons of water ; add 
the madder ; (it may be tied up in a bag) rub it fine in the 
water ; put in the goods, and let them remain one hour in 
the dye, which must not boil, but be kept at a scalding heat. 
Keep the goods in motion, and when they have been in one 
hour, let them boil five minutes ; then take them out, stir 
and rinse them out well, without wringing, and dry them in 
the shade. For a crimson dye, take for each pound of 
goods, two and a half ounces of alum, and an ounce and an 
half of white tartar ; put them in a brass kettle with water 
enough to cover the goods ; boil them briskly a few min- 
utes ; then put in the goods, washed clean and rinsed in 
fair water. When the goods have boiled half an hour, take 
tiMm ottt without wringing, and hang them where they will 
cool all over alike, without drying ; empty out the alum and 
tartar water ; put fresh water in the kettle, and for each 
pound of' goods, put in an ounce of cochineal, powdered 
fine. After the water has boiled fifteen or twenty minutes, 
reduce it to a lukewarm temperature, by adding cold water ; 
then put in the goods and boil them an hour and a quarter. 
Take them out without wringing, and dry them in the 
■shade. Balm of Gilead blossoms, steeped in fair water, 
then strained, make a pretty led dye for silks. The silk 
must be free of color, washed clean, rinsed, and boiled in 
the strained dye, with a small lump of alum. For faded 
fancy shawls and ribbons, use a carmine saucer, to color a 
fine delicate pink ; the directions come with the saucers. 

603. Blue Black Dye. 

Wet in strong suds a pound of goods, and wring them 
dry ; put into a thin clpth bag a pound of ground logwood, 
and put this into sufiicient vinegar or sour cider, to cover 
the goods, and hang it where it will keep warm several 
hours, boiling it a few minutes at the last. Put in your 
goods, and let them remain in the dye two or three days, 
without boiling, airing them daily. Take your goods out of 
the warm dye, spread them evenly in the shade to dry, and 
ihen wash them out in strong suds.

COMMON DYES. 191 

604. Black Dye, 

Take for a pound of goods a pound of logwood. Soak 
the logwood in soft water over night ; boil it an hour, and 
strain the water. Allow for each pound of logwood an 
ounce of blue vitriol ; dissolve the vitriol in enough luke- 
warm water to wet. the goods ; dip the goods in ; when sat- 
urated, turn the whole into the logwood dye. If the goods 
are cotton, place the vessel on the fire, and let the goods 
boil ten or fifteen minutes, stirring them constantly to pre- 
vent their spotting. For silk and woolen goods, do not boil 
the dye stuff*. Only keep it at a scalding heat for twenty 
minutes. Drain the goods without wringing, and hang them 
in a shady, but dry airy place. When dry, put the goods 
into scalding water, with one teacup of salt to three gallons 
of the water. Let the goods be in it till cold, then hang 
them to dry, without wringing, Boiling hot suds is the best 
thing to set the color of black silk ; let it be in till cold. 
Sour milk is good to soak goods in, to set a black dye. 

605. Slate Colored Dye, 

Boil sugar-loaf paper with .vinegar, in an iron vessel, 
adding alum to set the color. This makes a good dark 
slate color. Tea grounds, set with x;opperas, also. For a 
light slate color, boil in a brass vessel, white maple bark in 
clear water, adding a little alum. The dye for slate color 
should be strained before putting in the goods. They 
should be boiled in it ; then hung out to drain and dry. 

606. Yellow Dyes. 

For a buff color, boil equal parts of common potash and 
anatto in pure soft water. When dissolved, tsike it from 
the fire ; put in the goods when cool, first washed free from 
spots and color ; place them on a moderate fire, where the 
goods will keep hot till of the shade desired. To dye 
orange or salmon color, tie anatto in a bag, and soak it in 
warm soft soap suds, till so soft you can squeeze enough 
of it through the bag to make the suds a deep yellow. Put 
in the articles clean and free of color, and boil them till of 
the shade you wish. Have sufiicient dye to cover the 
goods, and stir them while boiling to keep them firom spot-

ling. This dye will make a salmon or orange color, ac- 
cording to the strength of it, and the time the goods remain 
in. Drain them out of the dye, and dry them quickly in 
the shade ; then wash them in soft soap suds. Goods dyed 
in thb manner should never be rinsed in clear water. 
Peach leaves, fustic, and saffron, all make good straw or 
lemon color, according to the strength of the dye. They 
should be steeped in soft fair water, in tin or earthen, and 
then strained, the dye set with ahim, and a little gum-arabic 
dissolved in the dye, if you want to stiffen the article. 
When the dye stuff is strained, steep the articles in it. 

607. Oreen and Blue Dye for Silks and Woolens. 

To dye green, take a pound of oil of vitriol, and pour it 
on half an ounce of Spanish indigo, that has been reduced 
to a fine powder. Stir them well together ; add a pea- 
sized lump of salaeratus, bottle it as soon as fermentation 
ceases, and you may use it next day. Make chemic blue 
in the same manner, using only half the quantity of vitriol. 
For woolen goods the East indigo answeri^ as well as the 
Spanish, and is cheaper. This dye will not do for cotton 
goods, as the vitriol rots the threads. Wash the articles 
to be colored perfectly clean and free from color. If the 
color cannot be extracted by rubbing in hot suds, boil out 
and rinse in soft water, till entirely free from soap, as the 
soap will spoil the dye. To dye a pale color, put to each 
quart of soft warm water that is to be used for the dye, ten 
drops of the above composition. To dye a deeper color, 
add more. Put in the articles without crowding, and let 
them remain in till sufficiently dyed. Keep the dye warm ; 
take the articles out without wringing, drain as dry as pos- 
sible, then hang them to dry in a shady airy place. They 
should be dyed in dry weather. Unless dried quick, they 
will not look nice. When perfectly dry, wash them in 
lukewarm suds, to prevent injury of the texture by the vit- 
riol. If you wish a lively bright green, mix a little of the 
above composition with yellow dye. 

608. Beautiful Pink Dye. 
Take three parts cream of tartar, and one of cochineals 
nicely rubbed together. Tie a teaspoonful in a muslin bag ; 



BOAM, 193 

put thiB with a quart of boiling water ; dip in the articles 
to be colored, previously cleaned and dipped in :^um water. 
If wished stiff put in a little gum-arabic. 

609. Cold Soap, 

Mix twenty-six pounds of melted and strained grease, 
vrith four pailfuls of lye, made of twenty pounds of white 
potash. Let the whole stand in the sun, stirring it fre- 
quently. In the course of the week, fill the barrel with 
weak lye. It is much easier than to make a lye of your 
ashes ; while quite as cheap, if you dispose of your ashes 
to the soap boiler. 

610. Hard Soap. 

Dissolve twenty pounds of white potash in three pailfuls 
of water. With twenty pounds of strained hot grease, mix 
the dissolved potash, and boil them till a thick jelly, which 
is ascertained by examining a little of it taken out and 
cooled. Take it off the fire, stir in cold water till it grows 
thin, then add to each pailful a pint of blown salt, stirring 
it well. Next day remove the lye, and heat it over a slow 
fire ; boil fifteen minutes, and take it off. Put in a little 
palm oil if you wish the soap of a yellow color, and pour 
it into wooden vessels. When cold separate it from the 
lye again, and cut it into bars. Place them in the sun a 
few days to dry. 

611. Windsor Soap. 

To make the celebrated Windsor soap, — slice the best 
white bar soap as thin as possible, and melt it over a slow 
fire ; then take it off, and when lukewarm, add sufiicient 
oil of caraway to scent it, or any other fragrant oil. Pour 
it into moulds, and let it remain five or six days in a dry 
place. 

612. Bayherry, or Myrtle Soap. 

Dissolve two pounds four ounces of white potash in &ve 
quarts of water ; mix with it ten pounds of bayberry tallow ; 
boil all over a slow fire till it turns to soap ; add a teacup 
of cold water ; boil it ten minutes longer ; turn it into tin 
moulds for a week or ten days to dry, first scenting it with 
any essential oil that may be preferred. It may be used in

three or four weeks, but is better a year old ; is excellent 
for shaving, for chapped hands, and for eruptions on the 
face. 

613. Potash Soap, First rale. 

Put into your soap barrel, sixteen pounds of clean grease ; 
sixteen of good potash ; and a pailful of warm water. Stir 
it thoroughly ; and add, daily stirring it several times, a 
pailful of cold or warm water every day, till full. 

614. Cosmetic Soap, for washing the hands. 
Take a pound of castile soap, or any other nice old soap ; 
scrape it fine ; put it on the fire with a little water ; stir it 
to a smooth paste ; turn it into a bowl ; when cold, add 
some lavender water, or any kind of essence : beat it with 
a silver spoon till well mixed ; thicken it with Indian meal, 
and keep it in small pots, closely covered ; exposure to the 
air will harden it. 

615. Superior Soft Soap. 

Cut in small pieces, a pound and a half of bar soap, into 
four quarts of rain water ; add four ounces of pure carbon- 
ate of soda ; dissolve them over the fire, and when dissolved, 
stir in one spoonful of salt : — very nice for woolens and 
calicoes.. 



615, a. Potato 'Yeast Bread. 

Put into the usual quantity of yeast for four loaves, eight boiled 
mealy potatoes, mashed fine, adding enough water to make the 
whole of yeast-consistency ; let it stand all night, where a little 
warm ; and then rub it through a colander into your fiour — much 
improves the bread. 

615, b. Chicken Tea. 

Take off the skin and fat ; cut the fowl in small pieces, and 
boil it till very tender, adding a little salt. Some boil, with it, a 
little wheat flour tied in a muslin bag. Skim off the fat, if any, 
when done. ^15^ c. 

Molasses, for all kinds of cooking, is much improved by boiling 
and skimming. g.^ ,

MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 



616. To extract Tar, Paint, Orease, and Stains frwn Carpets, 
and the finest fahries, without injury to the texture, or to the 
most delicate colors, — 

Wet soft linen incamphine, and rub the soiled spot till restored. 

617. To Preserve different kinds of Fruit through the Winter. 

Take hard sound apples ; wipe them dry, pack them in tight barrels, put- 
ting a layer of bran to each of apples, so as not to let the apples touch eadi 
otiber, and you m^y keep them tul June. Keep the barrel in a cool place, 
enveloped in a linen cloth, to prevent the apples freezing. Some lay mortar 
over the top of a barrel of apples to preserve them. It draws the air from 
them, and tnus prevents their decay. Vo not let the mortar touch the apples. 
Lemons and oranges may be kept some months, by wraj^ing such as are per- 
fectly fresh in separate soft pa{)er8, and securing them in glass jars, or per- 
fectly tight boxes, packed in white sand dried several hours in the oven after 
baking. Cover each thickly, then cover the whole so. Close the vessel 
tight, and keep it in a cool (uy place. To keep grapes, pick them on a dry 
day before qujte dead ripe, reject the bad ones, lav the bunches in a glass 
jar, sprinkle round each a thick layer of dry bran so they shall not touch each 
other, put a thick layer on the top, and cork and seal the jar. By cutting off 
the extreme end of the stems, on eating them, and placing the stems in sweet 
wine a few minutes, they will so imbibe the wine as to restore the grapes to 
their formei freshness. To keep green grapes, gooseberries, currants, and 
plums, throudi the winter, fill junk bottles with the fruit, set them in an oven 
six or seven hours after baking ; when the fruit has shrunk, take from one 
bottle to fill the others quite full. Cork and seal tight. To make pies of 
them, put them in a tin pan, cover them with boiling water, stew son, and 
sweeten them. To keep ripe whortleberries and blackberries, dry themper- 
fectly in the sun, and tie them in bags thick enough to exclude the air. Treat 
them like the green fruit when used. Ripe currants dried on the stem, pick- 
ed off, and put in bags, will keep good for pies all winter. They make a nice 
tea for fevers, especially the hectic. They are excellent to counteract the 
effects of opium. 

618. To make Tomato Ketchup, and to keep Tomatoes and Lima 

Beans through the Winter, 

To one gallon of skinned tomatoes, put four spoonfuls of salt, four of black 
pepper, three of mustard, half a spocmful of allspice, and eight pods of red 
pepper. AU the ingredients shoula be made fine, and simmered slowly in ft

Pack Lima beans in a cask, with alternate lavers of fine salt ; pnt a weight 
on them, cover and keep them where cool and dry. The later the pods are 
gathered the better. • 

619. Lemon Citron. 

Turn water on nice fresh lemon peels, soak them till you can scr^e all 
the white pulp off, then boil them till soft. Preserve them with hall their 
weight of sugar. They are a good substitute for citron. 

630. Tarragon Vinegar, 

Pick the tairajpa nicely from the stems ; let it lay in a dry place twe days; 
to a guart of the leaves put in a pitcher, turn three pints ot vinegar; aner 
standing a week, closely covered, strain it ; and when clear, bottle, and oook 
it close. 

621, il Cheap Water Filter. 

Lay a thick bed of pounded charcoal on the bottom of a large common 
earthen flower-pot, and over this lay a bed of fine sand about four inches 
thick. 

622. To Prepare Rennet. 

Take the stomach of a calf as soon as slaughtered ; do not wash it ; hang 
it four or five days in a cool dry place, then turn it inside out, slipping off all 
the curd with the hand ; put in suiTicient salt with a little saltpetre, lay it in 
a small stone pot, turn on it a teaspoonful of vinegar, sprinkle over it a himd- 
fbl of salt, ana cover it tight. In six or eisht weeks, cutoff apiece four 
Inches square, put it in a vessel that will hold a pint and a half, add fivp giUa 
of cold water, and one of rose brandy, stop it close, and shake it when about 
to use it. A spoonful is enough for a quart of milk. Weil prepared, in cool 
weather, it will keep more than twelve months. Add, if necessar^r, more 
water and salt, as you diminish it. For cooking, it is nicer if wine is sub- 
stituted for the vinegar and water. The more common way is, to empty the 
stomach of its curd immediately after the calf is slaughtered, to thoroufhlj* 
salt it inside and out, and to let it lay ir salt one day, and then to streti^ it 
on a stick to dry. When dry lay it ars^ay, and use a little bit as wanted. 

623. To clean Calfs Head and Feet. See page 15. 

624. To Corn Beef, and to '^ Salt %n Snow.'" 

Put to each gallon of cold water one quart of rock salt, one ounce of salt- 
petre, and four ounces of brown sugar— ^you need not boil it)-^nd put in 
▼our beef. As long as any salt remains undissolved, the meat will be s^cet. 
if any scum rise, scald and skim the brine, and add more salt, sakpetre. and 
sugar. Rub a piece of meat over with a little salt, on putting it into the 
brme. If the weather is bot^gaslh the piece to the bone, ana put in salt. Put 
a flat stone or some weight on the meat, to keep it under brine, and cover the 
cask. Or thus, allowing to every four gallons of water two pounds of brown 
fu^ and six pounds of salt, boil it about twenty minutes, taking off the scum 
as it rises. The next day turn it on your meat packed in Uie pickling tub. 
Poor off this brine, boil and skim it every two months, adhting uuee ounces 



-.# 



of brawn sugar and half a poand of common salt. It will keep good a year. 
Sprinkle the meat with salt, and the next day wipe i^ dry, before turning 
toe pickle over it. Let it entirely cover the meat ; add four ounces oi salt- 
petre. Place canvas lids over your salting tubs, to admit the air and exclude 
fiies. For immediate use and for soupj you need only thoroughly rub vour 
pieces of beef or mutton with dry salt, placing them in a closely covered tub 
and turning them daily. You may thus keep mutton and beef sweet six or 
eight weeks. 

" Salting in snow ;— cover the bottom of a large clean tub four inches, with 
nice snow ; lay in your spare-ribs, fowls,. &c., cover each layer two or three 
inches, taking special care to fill snow into eve^ crack and cranny between 
the pieces and next the tub, and stuffing the towls with snow, and topping 
off with a layer of snow tight pressed down. Cover your tub, and the colder 
its location tne better. The meat will remain as fresh and juicy as When 
first killed. It will not freeze. The snow will not melt, unless there como 
a January thaw. 

C25. To Salt Pork, 

VoA. is said not to be so good for salting for having been kept fat all sum- 
mer. Oover the b6ttom of your barrel with coarse saltv Rock salt is the 
best. Put in your meat skin side down, i>utting a good layer of salt over each 
piece. If salted in the evening after it is slaughtered, it will pack closer 
than after stiffening by long laying. Make sufficient strong brine to quite 
cover the meat — (if not covered it will be rusty) — by dissolving salt in cold 
water till completely saturated. Boil and skim the brine ; then turn it on 
cold, first putting on a weight to keep the meat compact under brine. Always 
let there be undissolve salt in your pork barrel. What ia left will be as 

good as new for tj^ next year. If washed, nothing can be better for butter.

626. Westphalia Hcmts^^mode of curing them. 

Hang up your hams ten or twelve days — (the longer the tenderer and bet- 
ter if kept perfectly sweet)— then mix, for a common sized ham, a teacup of 
blown salt, a teacup of molasses, and one ounce of saltpetre ; lay the hams 
in a clean dry tub, rub them all over with the mixture, and rub the bone ef- 
fectually. Turn and rob the hams daily, for three weeks, occasionally rub- 
bing on a little blown salt. Nothing can be better if rightly smoked. Use 
com cobs for smoking. Hickory and apple-tree wood are good. Do not heat 
your hams. 

627. Virginia Mode of Curing Hams. 

Add salt to water so long as it i^l dissolve ; for every sixteen pounds of 
ham, add to your pickle two teaspoonj^ts of salseratus, and two ounces of 
saltpetre, adding also a gallon of qgiolassels to every hoeshead of brine. Let 
the nams lie in this pickle three or four weeks. Smoke them from one to 
three months. To retain the juices, smoke with the hock downwards. 

628. Western Mode of Curing Hams. 

Let the hams remain as for " Westphalia Hams," so long as they will keep 
sweet, afler the pork is cut out ; then rub around the bone of each ham a 
teaspoonful of saltpetre, and pack them in £ne salt, half a bushel to five hun- 
dred weight. Let them lay one month, ([f they settle, they are doing well. 
If they rise, take them up, and add more salt.) Then taking them out, rub 
with the hand all over the fleshy part of the iSam, a paste made of good ashes 
wet up with water— thus prepared, the flies will -not trouble them. Smokie 
them, hock downwards. 

629. A Cheap Smoke House. 
Take a barrel or hogsheadi and knock out both heads, and smoke your meat 



19S MISCSLLANBOtXS RECBIPTft* 

or ISsh ia it. Be careful of yoar fire. Put a few emben in a ttoStMt vestel^ 
lay on them a few cobs ; the cobs may occasionally beeprinkled with water; 
suspend your meat from sticks Uid aciposs the cask, covering it so as to oim- 
fcie the smoke, but not to extinguish the firs. A red hot bsr, ooreied witk 
■awdust or green wood may be used. 

630. To Pickle Salmon. 

Put a Ume half pint of vinegar to a quart of liquor tl|e fish has been boiled 
in, and half an ounce of whole black pepper — ^boif it, and pour it cold over the 
mhf laid in a deep dish— a good way to dress the salmon after a dinner. To 
boil a salmon on purpose to pickle, it keeps better for not bein£ scaled. 
Pour a little sweet oil over the top of the pickle, and the salmon will keep 
good for months. 

631. To Pickle Shad, 

With a peck of rock salt and two quarts of blown, mix a pound of mmr 
and four ounces of saltpetre ; allow this preparation for every twenty-five 
shad. Put a layer of (his at the bottom of your barrel, then a layer of well- 
cleaned shad, with the skin down ; then another layer of salt, sugar, and 
saltpetre, and thus till you get in all the shad. Place a smooth flat stone or 
'Some heavy weight on the shad, to keep them under brioe. If in the course 
of a week the juice of the shad do not make sufficient brine to cover them, 
add a little brine. 

632. To Cure Herring. 

Where the location will admit of it ; for family use, take your beef bnne 
which is left of your winter's stock, to the fishing place; select the largest, 
and throw them in alive — (the brine they drink before they die, has a won<ter- 
ful effect in preserving their juices.) Let them remain twenty-four houra; 
take them out, and lay them in a sloping position to drain, then PJ^k them in 
a barrel till full, with coarse alum salt and saltpetre, in altenine layers of 
salt and fish, beginning with a layer of coarse alum salt, and taking care not 
to bruise the fish. Be liberal with your sah. In a few weeks, if they are not 
covered with brine, make some and add. Put a cover oter them, and a weight 
to keep them under brine. When a year or two old, they are not inferior to 
anchovies 

633. An EacellerU Common Pickle for Hams and Tongues. 

Allow for each gallon of water a pound and a half of salt, a pound of brown 
sugar or molasses, an ounce of saltpetre, and an ounce of allspice ; scald, 
skim, and cool it» Turn it on the meat, the meat first having been rubbed 
over with fine salt and lain two days. Let the meat remain in the pickle from 
two to four weeks, turning it daily. Canvas or coarse calico bags are good 
for keeping meat after it is smoked. Dip the bags several times in strong 
brine, and dty them before putting it in, or put it in and then whitewash 
the bags. 

634. To Try Lard and Tallow. 

Lard tries easier the day the pork is butchereiL It need not then be wask 
ed, except where stained. Cut it into pieces ; put it in an iron pot with a 
very little water to prevent burning ; boil it slowly over a moderate fire, stir- 
ring it .occasionally to prevent burning, till the scraps are quite Ihowu ; strain 
it through a coarse cloth, spread over a colander, into your lard tub— what 
you want for your nicest withofit squeezing the strainer — then squeeze the 
scraps as dcy as possible. Use the last strained first, as it will not keep so 
long as the first. Keep your lard covered in a cool dry place. Some salt the 
lard while trying, others do not. The latter keeps equally well with the 
salted. The scraps are nice for eating. Tallow is tried in the same way. 
It should lie where perfectly cool and dry several days, and be stirred befiwe 



trying. S<Mne prefer having the. lard. lay a day or twe belpre trying it. It 
fihoald then be washed thoroughly in cold water. The leaves make the 
nicest lard. 

635. To Manage Bees, 

The best mode known to the writer, is to make the bees a convenient snug 
little bed-room near your own. In the end of your dwelling-house, or in any 
of your out-buildings, make them a room with a number of shelves, having a 
door for entry at pleasure ; place a hive on one of the shelves ; on the top of 
this hive, or at its side, place another, or a box^ into which the bees can pass 
from the main hive, and which may be removed when full. They will sus- 
pend the comb to the shelves when all else is full. Make an opening through 
the outside of the building for the convenience of the bees going in and out. 
Among others, the writer would take the liberty of referring to a Mr. Bra- 
man, of Worcester, Mass. as having a good apiary t>f the kind described. See 
others also in Chester. In this way there is but little danger of a colony's 
being robbed on account of their weakness. As these little fellows are occa- 
sionally pugnacious, and seem impelled by a kind of simultaneous fandly 
impulse to make an assault upon their peaceable neighbors, the assailants 
may be identified at their own homes, by the sprinkling a little flour over 
them while in the act of robbery and murder abroad. But it is beyond the 
ait of man to mediate a truce. You must either take up the hive attacked, 
or submit to its being plundered, and its inhabitants made prisoners of war. 
The chance for the assailants to fall, on the battle field, is small. 

636. To Make Cream, 

Mix two teaspoonfuls of flour, the well beaten yolks of two eggs, and a tea- 
spoonful of sugar, and turn on gradually a pint of boiling milk, stirring con- 
stantly to prevent lumps. A very small bit of nice butter is sometimes added. 
Or, for conee, beat the white of an egg to a froth, adding a small bit of butter, 
and turn the coflfee to it gradually, that it may not curdle. Its taste is very 
similar to that of fresh cream. - 

637. Yeast of Cream of Tartar and Sahzratus, 

Heat your oven ; mix^two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar with one quart 
of flour, then dissolve one teaspoonful of salseratus in warm water, and mix 
it with the flour, adding water enough to make it soft dough. — ^As soon as 
thoroughly kneaded, place it in your oven until sufliciently baked, and the 
bread will be tender and of the nicest kind. Biscuit may be made in the 
same way by adding a little shortening. 

638. Tartaritc Acid Yeast, 

Tartaric acid may be used in all cases for cooking, where an acid is 
wanted. It imparts no other taste than that of pure acidity. In connection 
with ssJseratus or soda, it makes a very quick and convenient yeast, for 
raising bread and biscuit of all kinds ; for crust ; and for sriddle cakes. 
Use equal quantities of each. For doughy put in a teaspoonful of salseratus 
to a quart ol flour. Then mould it up, putting in a teaspoonful of the acid. 
Let It stand fifteen or twenty minutes, and bake. For griddle cahest stir in 
eqnal proportions of salseratus and acid, putting in the acid last, andimme 
diately before cooking. 

639. Gardener Flour Pudding. 

Put a pint and a half of flour in a pan ; add four well beaten eggs, a quart 
of mUk, and two teaspoonfuls of salt. Beat all together till thorou^dy

beaten when a little cool, and a little salt, and stir all well together. Baks 
&om twenty to thirty minutes. 

642. To Fricassee Eggs, 

Boil six eggs Ave minutes ; lay them in cold water, peel them carefony, 
dredge them lightly with flour, beat one egg perfectly hght, dip in the hara 
eggs, roll them in bread crums, seasoned with salt, pepper, and nntm^, 
covering them well, then letting them stand awhile to dry ; fry them in boil- 
ing lard, and serve them up with any kind of rich well-seasoned gravy, and 
garnish with crisped parsley. 

643. CM Sweet Sauce for Puddings. 

Kub equal auaatities of butter and su^ar to a cream, add a little vrine, 
form it into a lump, set it in a cool place tor fifteen minutes, then grate nut 
meg over it. Currant jelly may be substituted for the wine 

644. Buckwheat Cakes, 

Turn on to three cups of flour and a teaspoonful of salt, enough hot water 
to make a thin batter. When lukewarm, add a spoonful of yeasty and set it 
in a warm place to rise. In the morning add a teaspoonful of salseratas in a 
teacup of hot water. If mixed in the evening, and it rise too fast, set the 
batter in a cool place through the night. Some of the same ba^er may be 
reserved for the next time. 

645. Cheap Mountain pound Cake, 

To one egg and four ounces of butter, well beaten together ; add a tea- 
spoonful of Idlspice; half a teaspoonful of pepper; pint of molasses ; tea- 
spoonful of salaetratus, dissolved in a teacup of creamy or milk ; and flour 
enough to make the consistency of fritters ; set it where quite warm to rise ; 
and when perfectly light, bake moderately. 

646, Noodles for Sot^. 

Thicken two eggs with flour, adding a little salt, till stiff enough to roll 
out like piecrust : sift flour over it ; do up the sheet in folds, sifting flour 
over each ; then shave it into very fine strmgs, and boil them in your soup 
fifteen minutes. 

647. To Clarify Sugar,

Wash 8 pedt of good f>uTe wheat ; cover it with water in a tub plaeeii m 
the son : change the water daily to {>irevent its unpleasant smell ; when the 
wheat becomes very soft^ nib it out in water, throw the husks into another 
tub, let the white substance settle, turn off the water, put on fresh, stir it 
well, and let it settle ; do this daily,tiU the water turns off perfectly clear. 
Put the starch in a bag» and set it in the sun a few days ; then take it out, 
«xid dry it on platters*

649. To make Potato Starch, 

Wash perfectly clean half a bushel of nice potatoes, grate them, wash the 
pulp thoroughly, rinsing and straining it througn a sieve ; stir it wiell, and turn 
off the water after the starch has settled. Add new water ; next day stir 
well, let settle, and turn off the water again, aix) thus till the water turns off 
dear, adding a little bluing to the last. Collect and dry the starcik 

€60. To prepare Starch for Use* 

Wet your starch gradually with cold water till it will readily pour, rubbing 
it perfectly smooth with a spoon ; stir it into boiling water, and let it boil five 
or six minutes, frequently stirrii^ it; stir in a little spermaceti, or stir it 
with a caudle ; stram uid use it. 

Poland starch is made in the same manner. Muslins, to look clear and 
nice, should be clapped dry-while the starching is hot, then folded in a very 
damp cloth till quite damp before ironing. Isinglass is a very delicate starch 
for fine muslins ; also rice. Some add a very little fine salt to starch. 

651. White Apple Sauce, 

Pare and quarter tart apples ; put to them enough waler to prevent thehr 
buinine, and boil till perfectly tender. Sweeten with sugar, ana season with 
gzated lemon, mace, or nutmeg. 

652. Opodeldoc, 
Put into a pint of the spirits of wine, two ounces of camphor and a cake of 
Windsor soap sliced fine ; put all in a quart cup, cover close and set it in 
boiling water, and let it remain till they are dissolved. Add two ounces of 
the oil of origanum, and, when milk warm, a little salt. 

653. Soft Pomatum, 

Take nice sweet lard without salt ; put with it such perfume as preferred^ 
beat it to a cream, and put it in small pots. 

654, To Preserve Herbs, 

Gather them on a dry day, just before blossoming ; suspend them, tied in 
bunches, in a dry airy place, with the blossom end downwards ; wrap the 
medicinal ones, when perfectly dry, in paper, and keep them from the air. 
Pound fine and sift the leaves of such as are to be used in cooking, and keep 
the powder in corked bottles. 

655. To preserve Vegetables through the Winter, 

Keep succulent vegetables in a damp, shad^, cool place. Protect pota- 
toes, turnips, and similar vegetables from the air and frost, by burying them 
in sand, rotatoes will not sprout, it is said, if covered with charcoal dust. 
It is also said that sweet potatoes will keep months thus, — ^packed in boxes 
of diy sand, exposed to tiie influences oi smoke.

660, Boat Varnish, 

I Shred an ounce of India Rubber into a pint of Seneca oil ; it will dissolve In 

' a few days — and rub it on your l)oots wiUi a sponge till the leather is satura- 

ted. Lay them by a day or two. Repeat the varnishing in the sun, or by 
the fire. • 

^^\. Cement for Corked Bottles, 

Melt with four ounces of sealing-wax, four of rosin and two of bees* wax. 
. Stir it with a tallow candle when it froths, and as soon as it melta, dip into it 

' the mouths of the corked bottles — it will make them air ti^ht. Some use two 

\ ounces of shellac, four of Spanish brown, and four of rosin. 

662. Cement for Broken Glass, China, or Earthenware. 

Rub the edges of the broken vessel with the beaten white of an egg ; tie 
finely powdered quicklime in a muslin bag, and sift it thick over the egg ; 
match and bind the pieces together, and let them remain bound several weeks. 
I This is a cement for all kinds of crockery but thick heavy glass-ware, or coarse 

;, earthen. The former cannot be cemented — for the latter use white paint. 

;. Paint the broken edges, match and bind them tight together, letting them 

remain till the paint is dry and hard. Milk is a good cement. Match the 
pieces, bind them tight together, put the ware in cold milk^ boil the milk half 
an hour, take it from the nre and let the crockery remain till the milk is cold. 
Keep the crockery bound several weeks. The Chinese mode of mending 
broken china is to grind fiint glass on a painter's stone, till it becomes an im- 
palpable powder, and then to beat it with the white of an egg to a froth, and 
lay it on the broken edges, and match and bind them, and let them remain 
some weeks. It is said to be impossible to break 'the ware where thus 
cemented. 

1 663. Japanese Cement, or Rice Glue. 

Boil gently rice flour mixed to a smooth paste, with cold water. It is far 
more transparent and smooth than wheat flour paste, and answeFS the same 



nurpose. This glue, made of the consistency of pkstic clay, may be used 
for busts, models, basso-relievos, and like articles. They are susceptible of 
m high polish made of it. Poland starch is a fine cement for pasting layers 
of paper or fancy articles. 

664. Alabaster Cement. 

Melt a pound of white bees' wax and a pound of rosin, and strew over it 
gently three quarters of finely pulverized alabaster. Stir all well togedier, 
and knead if in water, to thoroughly incorporate the mass. The alabaster, 
when meodedt should be heated ; heat the cement also on applying it. Join, 
bind together, and let it remains week. It is a very strong cement. 

665; Iron^oare Cement; and To mend cracks inStoves and Pipes* 

Stir into the white of eggs beaten to a froth, enough powdered craick lime 
to make a consistent paste, and then stir in iron file dust to ms^e a thick 
paste. Fill the cracks of iron-ware with this cement, and do not use it for 
some weeks. Mend crapks in stoves and pipes, by applying a paste of wood^ 
ashes, salt, and water. 

606. To renew Stale Bread and Cake> 

Fill a Inread steamer about half full of water, and lay the old bread on it, 
and put it on the fire, where it will steam the bread thirty or forty minutes ; 
then wrap the bread in a towel, and let it remain till dry. Old dry bread may 
tiius be made moist and good. As a substitute for a steamer, soak the l»ead 
m cold water till it has absorbed enough water to be moist throughout ; then 
put it in a bake-pan without any cover, and make it very hot. If broken 
pieces of bread are put in the oven for several hours after baking, and rusked, 
they will keep good a long time. Heavy sour bread, in this wav, may be 
made into tolerably good cakes and pudding, if enough salaeratus be used to 
correct the acidity. Rich' cake, that has wme or brandy, will keep good sev- 
eral months in cold weather, if kept cool and dry. When it is to be eaten, 
pot it in a cake pan and set it in a bake pan that has half a pint of water in 
tt ; put on the bake pan cover, and let the cake bake till heated very hot 
Let it get cold before cutting. 

' 667. To Pot Cheese. 

' Cheese that has begun to mould, may be kept from becoming more so, if 
treated thus : — cut on the mouldy part, then grate it, if the cheese be dry. If 
not, pound it fine in a mortar, crust and all. To each pound, when fine, put 
a spoonful of brandy, mix it well with the cheese, press it tight in a clean 
stone pot, and lay a paper wet in brandy on the top. Cover the pot tight, 
and keep it in a cool ary place. Dry pieces of cheese may be potted in the 
same manner. Potted cheese is best a year old. It vidll keep several years 
without breeding insects. 

668. To preserve Cheese from Insects. 

Cover the cheese, while whole, with a flour paste ; wrap a cloth round it} 
and cover thi^ with paste ; keep the cheese in a cool d^ place. Cheese 
with insects, if kept till cold weather, will be free of them. 

669. To freshen Salt Butter. 
If butter is too salt, allow to each pound of it a quart of new milk ; chum 
it an hour, and then woiIl it like new butter ; working in a little white sugar 
improves it. It is said to be as ^ood as new butter. A bit of new salt buttex 
may be quite fireshened, by working it in odd water, and repeatedly ahanglaf 
the water.

670. To Extract the Rancidtty of Butter. 

Tike a little for immediate me, allowing two teaBpoonfuls of salsntni 
dissolved in a ouart of boiling water for a pound of butter ; pat in the butter, 
mix it well with the saleratus water, let it be till cold, then take it off cars- 
liilly, and work a teaspoonful of salt into it. Thus managed it does very wdl 
Ibr cooking. 

071. To fot Butter for Winter. 

into six poonds of new-made batter, work the mixture of a spoonfb] of 
powdered white sttgar, one of salt, and one of saltpetre. When yoa ha>e 
finished putting down your butter, in a stone pot, cover it with fine salt, pot 
ia alternate layers of salt with the butter ; cover so close aata exclude Um 
air. Some prefer potting butter in brine : — make the brine of the saltneas 
wished for tne butter, aod half a spoonful of saltpetre to two gaHons of brine, 
made by turning boiling water on the salt. Put it to the butter when coM, 
and let it cover the butter. Another method — free the butter entirely of the 
buttermilk ; vrork it op quickly with about half an ounce of salt to the pound ; 
let it lay one day or longer ; beat well together four ounces of salt, two of loaf 
sugar, and a quarter of an ounce of saltpetre, and work the mixture thoroughly 
into the butter, allowing half an ounce for every pound. Pack it in jars or 
tubs, and place a layer of the mixture in folds of thin muslin, stitching it 
loosely and placing it neatly over the top. 

672. To preserve Cream for Steamboats or Sea Voyages 

Mix fresh rich cream with half its weight of loaf sugar ; coik it t igKt at 
bottles. When used, no sweetening need be added. 

673. To keep Eggs tiU I7th of June, or for Christmas. 

Buy e^ for family use when cheapest ; put them into two gallons of 
water, nuxed with half a pint of salt and half a pint of unsUcked lime. Mtke 
the pickle with boiling water. Put it cold to the eggs. Let the eggs be new 
laid, and perfect; quite covered with the lime water, and kept in a stone pot 
in a cool place. Thus preserved, eggs will keep good six months. If occa- 
sionally turned over, the l)etter. 

*674. To prepare Fat for Shortening. 

Except ham and mutton, all kinds of meat make good i^rteaing. Scruw 
from the cold congealed drippings of roast meat, or the fat of boiled meat, too 
adhesive sediment ; slice the fat, adding any scraps of fat from broiled meat 
you may have ; melt it slowly, and strain it. When congealed into a haid 
cake, scrape off the sediment if air^ adhere, melt it again, and when partly 
cool, add a teaspoonful of salt to a pound of shortening. Use the dregs for 
soap-grease. Exceot in the hottest weather, shortening thus prepared is a 
good substitute ibr lard. The fat o( cooked meats should not be kept more 
than three days in summer, and seven in winter, without bein^ tried. Ham 
fat, if boiled in fresh water and clarilied, does very well to fiy m. And mut- 
ton-fat, melted into a tallow cake, will please the tallow-chandler. 

675. Directions for Washing White Cotton (roods. 

Turn boiling water on table cloths, and all white clothes stained by coffee 
or fruit, before putting them in soap suds, and let them lay till the water is 
cold, then rubbing out the stains. The stains wiU be irremovably set, if put 
into so^ suds. Table cloths will be less liable to stain if always rinsed in 
thin starch water, as that prevents the penetrating of stains. Put vexy diity 



IlISCELLANSOUS RECEIPTS. 205 

wbhe clothes in strong cool suds on the fire over night, and they will easily 
clean. If they get to boiling, do not care. It will not hurt them if the suds 
be cool on putting them in — if hot then, it will set the dirt. The fbUoming 
8aT«B labor :-^Soak clothes in lukewarm soap suds, if Tery dirty, over night; 
put a spoonful of ^alts of soda, and a pint of soft soap, to every three pails of 
water ; make it moderately warm ; put in the clothes without rubbing, and 
boil them an hour. " 

676. To Wash Calicoes. 

Before putting the clothes in water, rub out the grease spots ; they eaanot 
be seen after all is wet.* Wash them in mildly warm soap suds, which will 
clean them as well as hot suds, with less i^^uiy to the colors. Use soft soap 
for yellow shades, but for no other; and do not rinse in fair water. Rinse 
other colors in fair water, and dry them in the shad^. If calicoes incline to 
fade, set the colors by washing them in lukewarm water, with beef's gall, 
allowing a teacup for every four or fivegallons of water. No soap is required, 
unless the clothes are very dirty. Then wash them in tepid suds, after 
being rubbed out in beePs gall water. Rinse them in fair water. Beef's 
gall can be kept several months, by bottling it tight, and puttins in a little 
salt. Wash black calicoes in water that potatoes have been boiled in. Sudbi 
water may be saved through the whole week, or potatoes may be sliced and 
boiled, for the sake of the water. For mourning calico, the best way is to 
boil the clothes in strong hard soap suds about ten minutes, turning and 
pressing them in the suds, and then to rinse them in strong bluing water. — 
Thp following mode is said to set colors, so they will not fade by alter wash- 
ing :— add three gills of salt to four quarts of bouing water ; put in the calicoes 
perfectly clean, and let them remain till the water is cold. A little alum in 
the rinsing water is good for green and yellow ; or a little vinegar for green, 
pink, and red. All calicoes but black, kx>k better for starching. They will 
not look clear. Potato water, boiled to a thick consistence, stiffens them 
without showing. 

677. To Wash Woolens. 

If you wish to thicken your JSannels by shrinking them^ wash them in soft 
soapsuds, and rinse them in cold water. To prevent white flannels shrink- 
ing, wash them in haid soap suds, without rubbing any soap on them ; rub 
them out in another suds, wring them out, put them in a clean tub, pour on 
boiling water to cover them, and let them remain till the water is cold. A 
little indigo in the boiling water improves the looks of the flannels. Colored 
woolens that incline to fade, wash with beef's gall and warm water, before 
patting them in soap suds. Colored pantaloons look well washed with beef ^ 
gall and fair warm water, and pressed on the wrong side while damp. 

678. To remove Ink, Fruit Stains, and Iron Mould. 

Moisten the soiled part with cold watdr, then place it over the smoko of 
burning brimstone. Or wet the spots in milk, and cover them with salt, before 
washing the garments. Or dip ink stains in hot tallow. 

679. To remove Stains from Broadcloth. 

Take an ounce of fine ground pipe clay, mix it with twelve drops of alco- 
hol, and twelve of the spirits of turpentine ; moisten a little of this mixture 
with alcohol, whenever you wish to remove any stains, and rub it on them. 
Let it remain till dry, then rub it off with a woolen cloth. 

680. To extract Paint from Cotion, Silk, and Woolen Goods.

081. To extract Slack Stains from Scarlet Woolen Goods. 

Mix tartaric with water, to give it a oleasant acid, saturate the stains — (4I0 
not touch the unsoiled. part^rinse toe stains in fair water uunediat^. 
Weak salsratus water will remoTe stains caused by acids. 

68S. To extract Stains from Colored Silks and White Cotton 

Goods, 

Salts of ammonia, mixed with lime, will remoTe wine stains from silk; 
clear ammonia, alcohol, and spirits of turpentine, will all remore stains iiam 
colored silks. Durable or common ink spots may be removed, by saturating 
them with lemon juice, rubbing in salt, and then placing them where the son 
will shine on them hot for some hours. Put on more lemon juice and salt, 
as fast as it dries. Nitric acid is a good substitute, when lemon acid cannot 
be had. Remove iron mould in the same way. Mildew and most other 
stains can be removed by rubbing on soft soap and salt, and placing the stain 
where the sun will shine on it, hot. Use the remedies in warm, clear wea- 
ther, when the sun is hot. Sulphuric acid, diluted with water, is effeetoal 
in removing fruit stains. Do not have it so strong as to eat holes ; rinse ia 
salaeiatus, uien in fair water. Soak colored cotton ink stained goods in tefod 
sour milk. 

683. To extract Crreasefrom Floors, Silks, Woolen Goods and 

Paper, 

Rub floor grease spots with strong salaeratus water mixed with sand. And 
on those of goods and pi4>er, grate French chalk very thick ; (conunon chdBi 
is not so good)--HM>ver the chalk with soft brown paper, ana place on it a 
moderately hot iron, not scorching hot, and let it remain till oooL If the 
grease is not entirely removed, repeat the application of the brown paper uid 
a heated iron, until it is. 

684. To cleanse Silk Goods, 

Rub on silk cushions, or silk coverings to furniture, dry bran, with a woolen 
doUi, till clean. Remove grease spots and stains as by preceding receipts. 
Extract the spots of silk garments before washing. Use hard soap for all 
colors but veliow ; for yellow, soft soap is best. Beat the soap in hot wator 
till perfectly dissolved, then add just enough cold water to make it tepid ; rab 
the silks in it till clean ; take them out without wringing, and rinse thena in 
fair tepid water. Rinse them in another water — and for crinMons, bri^ 
yellows, and maroons, add enough sulphuric acid to the water to give it an 
acid taste. To restore the colors of the different shades of pink, put a little 
▼inegar or lemon juice in the second rinsing water. For scariet, use a solu- 
tion of tin ; for purplea, blues, and other shades, use salnratus ; and for olive- 
greens, dissolve verdi^s in the rinsing water. Rinse fawn and broMms in 
pure water ; dip the silks up and down in the rinsing water ; take them out 
without wringing, and dry them in the shade ; fold them while damp ; let 
them remain for the dampness to strike through all parts of them alike, and 
then put them in a mangier. If you have none, iron them on the wrong side 
with an iron only hot enough to smooth them. A little isinglass, or gum- 
arabic, dissolvedf in the rinsing water of gauze, shawls, and ribbons, is good 
to stiffen them. The water in which pared potatoes have been boiled, is an 
excellent thing to wash black silks in. It stiffens and makes them of a glossy 
faisok. Beef's gall and tenid water ara nice lor restoring nisty silks; and 



MISCELI.ANJSOUS RBCEIPTS. 207 

•oap suds answers very well. . The silks look better not to be rinsed in clear 
^ater, but they should be washed in two different waters. 

685. To clean Silk and Woolen 8?uiwls. 

Pare and grate mealy potatoes, and put to a pint of the pulp two quarts of 
cold water. On standing five hours, strain it through a sieve, rubbing an 
much of the potato through as possible. Let the strained water stand to 
settle ; wtien perfectly clear, turn the water .off carefully from the dregs ; 
spread a clean white cotton sheet on a clean table^ lay on the shawl to be 
<;leaned, and pin it tight. Dip a sponge that has never been used, in the 
potato water, and rub the shawl with it till clean ; rinse the shawl in clean 
water, with a teacup of salt to a pailful of water ; spread it on a clean level 
place, where it will dry very quick. If suspended to dry, the colors are apt 
to run and make the shawl streaked. Fold it up while damp, let it lay htuf 
an hour, and put it in a mangier ; or wrap it in a clean white cloth, and put 
it under a weight, and let it remain till dry. Grease spots, if any, should be 
extracted before washing the shawl. 

686. Carpets. 

Take up and shake carpets that are in constant use, three or four times a 
year. Tlfe dirt underneath wears them out very fast. Straw spread under- 
neath prevents their wear. To prevent moths, take up your carpets once a 
year, if but little usedr Sprinkle black pepper, or tobacco under your car- 
pets to protect them from moths. When treed of dust, remove the grease 
spots ; if soiled so as to need cleaning all over, spread them on a clean floor, 
and rub pared and grated Vaw potatoes on them with a new broom. Let 
them lay till perfectly dry, before walking on them. Some use beef's gall 
for cleaning carpets. Wash straw carpets in salt and water, and wipe them 
with a clean dry cloth. Some say, scour them with sand and water and a 
little hard soap. 

687. To renomte Rusty Italian Crape. 

Dissolve in half a pint of skim milk and water an inch square of glue> 
take it from the Are, nnse the crape in vinegar to clean it, then to stiffen it, 
put it in the glue mixture, wring it, clap it dry, and smooth it with a hot iron, 
first laying a paper over it. Saturate rusty crape by dipping it in gin ; clap 
it dry, and smooth it with a moderately hot iron. Italian crape can be dyed 
so as to look as nice as new. 

688. To clean Light Kid Gloves, 

Rub them smartly with India rubber, magnesia, or moist bread. If soiled 
beyond thus restoring, sew up the tops and rub them with a decoction of saf- 
fron and water, using a sp<mge. They will be yellow or brown, according 
to the strength of the decoction. 

Put on hm Gloves, Rub them with spirits of hartshorn ; or with flannel, 
dipped in milk, then rubbed on castile soap. 

689. To clean Mahogany and Marble^ and to restore Mahogany 

Varnish, 

Use no soap on them ; wash them in fair water, and rub them till diy wita 
a clean soft cloth. A little sweet oil, rubbed on occasionally, gives them a 
]x>lish. Rub furniture with a cloth dipped in oil ; then, with a clean cloth, 
till dry and polished. Rubbing with sweet oil will restore the spot« from 
which the varnish has been removed. White spots on varnished furniture 
may be removed, by rubbing them with a warm flannel dipped in spirits of 
turpentine. Remove ink ^ots by rabbin^ them with a woolen ckrth, dipped 
in the oil of Titriol and water. Be careful to touch only the spots with the

cold drawn linseed oil ; wipe off the oil, and pc4ish by rubbing smartly with a 
olean dry cloth. And marble may be cleaned thus :-^pound, yery fine, a 
little stone blue with four ounces of whiting ; mil thfem with ttn oun<5e df 
Soda dissolved in a little Water, and four ounces of soft sos^ : boil all fifteen 
minutes over a sldw Are, carefully stirring it. When quite hot, lay it on the 
maxble with a brush, and let it remain half an hour ; wash it off with warm 
water, flannel, and a scrubbing brush, and wipe it dry. Some clean alabas- 
ter and all kinds of marble, by mixing pulverized pumice stone with verjuice, 
letting it remain several hours ; then dipping in a perfectly clean sponge, and 
rubbing the marble till clean. Rinse it off with fair water, and rub it dry 
with a clean linen cloth. 

690. To clean Kmnes and Forks. 

Use finelv powdered Bath brick to remove rust, and to polish steel u£eit> 
sils. Rub knives on a board with a thick le&tber cover over it fastened dowo 
tight, applying a cork dip|)ed in the powder, and moistened ff they are spotted. 
rk> not wet them, only wipe them with a dry cloth. Wipe the handles with 
a cloth rather damp, to make them smooth ; do not touch the blades as it will 
tarnish them. It will yellow ivory handles to dip them in hot water. H 
yellow rub them with sand paper. If Bath brick does not remove rust from 
steel, rub the spots with sand paper or emery, or ruff on sweet oil and let it 
remain a day, and then rub it off with quicklime. Clean thoroughly steel 
utensils that are not in constant use ; rub them over with sweet oil, and 
exclude the air by a wrapper of brown paper — ^wrapping each knife and fork 
separately. 

691. To polish Brass^ Silver ^ and Britannia Utensils. 

Dip a cloth moistened with spiriti, (oil Will do,) into pulverized rotten 
stone, and rub your brasses ; and then poHlhthem with diy rotten stone and 
a dry cloth. When brass utensils are not in use, thofott^ly clean them with 
rotten stone and oil, wrap them up tight to exclude the air, and keep them in 
a dry place. Polish sUver with whiting or chalk ;)ulveri2ecL If spotted, rub 
the chalk wet on the silver, and let it remain till dry ; then rub it off and 
polish with a clean dry cloth. Hot ashes will remove spots which chalk will 
not. Rub Britannia^ if spotted, with a flannel cloth dipped in sweet of tin* 
seed oil, and then wash it in soap £(^(ls and wipe dry. Polish by rubbing 
over, with a clean dry cloth, whitings or chalk. 

692. Cautions relativB to Brass, Copper^ and Glazed Earthen 

' Utensils. 

Many lives have been lost in consequence of carelessness in the tise trf* 
these utensils. Thoroughly cleanse with salt and hot vinegar, brass and 
copper, before cooking in them ; and never suffer any oily or acid substancti 
ailer cooked, to cool or remain in any of them. 

693. To clean Stoves and Stone Inearths* 

Put on Varnished stdves several coats of varnish in the summer, to have it 
cet haid before usedi Wash them in warm water without soap, and mb a 
uttle oil on them occasionally, it will make them look nice, and prevent 
the varnish wearing off. Black stoves that have never been varnished, with 
black lead and British lustre. It will not answer if they have been varnished. 
Mix them with cold water to a paste, rub it on the stoves, and let the paste

Put salfleratus into hot water till very strong ; saturate the putty or paiat 
daub with it ; let it remain till nearly diy ; then rub it off hard with a woolen 
eloth. Whiting is good to remove it. Salasratus water is good to remove 
putty while green, on the glas8% 

095. To exttadt Ink from Floors, 

Remove ink stains from floors^ by scouring them with sand wet with water 
and the oil of vitriol, mixed. Then rinse them with strong salseratus water. 

• 696. To temper Earthen-ware, 
Boil earthen-ware that is used for bakings (before using it, as it will be less 
liable to (^ck,) covering it with cold water, and then heating it gradually. 
Let it remain in till the water has cooled^ 

697. To temper New Ovens and Iron-ware, 

Before a new oven is baked in, keep up a fire in it half a day. Put up the 
lid as soon as the wood is removed. Do not use it for baking till it has oeen 
heated the second time^ It will never retain its heat well, unleis Umf 
pared in this way. Heat new flat-irons half a day also, before using them, 
to have them retain their heat well. New iron cooking utensils will oe less 
liable to crack, if heated gradually five or six hours, and then cooled slowlv 
before being used. Do not tum«cold water into hot iron utensils, as it wiU 
crack them by cooling the surface too suddenly. 

698. To loosen tighdy wedged Stopples xj Decanters and Smelling 

Bottles, 

Rub a feather dipped in oil round the stojpiple, close to the moiith of the 
bottle : place the mouth of the bottle towards we fire, about two feet from it. 
When warm, strike the bottle lightly on both sides, with any convenient 
wooden instrument, and take out the stoi>ple. You may have to repeat the 
process. By perseverance, you will ultimately triumph, hojvever closely 
wedged in. 

699. Lip Salve, 

Dissolve a small lump of white sugar in a spoonful of fose-tiMifer, (or com»

703. To cleanse Vials and Pie Plates, 
Cleanse bottles that have had medicine in them, by putting ashes in each, 
numersini them in cold water and then heating the water gradually tin it 
bmls. After boiling an hour, let them remain in the water till it is odd. 
Wash them in soap suds, and rinse them till clear in fair water. Pie platss 
that have been long used for baking, are apt to impart an unpleasant taste 
on account of the rancidity of the cutter and lard, imbibed. Put them in a 
brass kettle, with ashes and cold water, and boil them an hour. 

704. To make Stigar^ or Honey Vinegar. 

Dissolve one part of sugar with seven of water moderately wwrm ; put it 
in a cask ; stir m a pint of yeast to every eight gallons 08top it close, and 
keep it in a wann place till sufficiently sour : or to one quart of clear hmey, 
add eight of warm water, mixing it well. Afler the acetous fei;;||^entation, s 
white vinegar will be formed, in many respects better than common vinegaar. 

705. Lemon Pickle. 
Grate the yellow rind from twenty-five fresh lemons ; quarter thera, leav- 
ing them united at the blossom end ; sprinkle salt over them, and place theiD 
in the sun daily till dry ; then brush off the salt ; put them in a pot with 
pounded mace and nutmeg, an ounce of each, a handful of scrapKed dried 
norse radish, twenty cloves of garlic, and a pint of mustard seed. Turn on a 
gallon of strong vinegar ; cover the pot close ; let it stand tiiree months ; 
strain it ; and when clear, bottle it. 

706. Stocks Prepared for Soups or Gravies. 

Cut a knuckle of veal in slices, a pound of lean beef, and a pound of leao 
ham. Put all in a pan, with three carrots, two onions, two turnips, two heads 
of celery, and two quarts of water. Let them stew till tender, without 
browning. Thus prepared, the stock may be used for soups, or for white or 
brown gravy ; if for brown, it must first be colored in the usual manner. 

707. Sandwiches. 

Cut, and spread neatly with butter, slices of biscuit, placing between eveiy 
two pieces, a very thin slice of tongue. Lean ham, or the white meat <n 
fowl may be substituted for the tongue. 

708. To kill Cockroaches J Ants, and other Vermin. 

Rub hellebore with molasses, and place it where cockroaches congress ; 
spread arsenic on bread and butter, and give it to your rats — (use all poisons 
with the greatest caution) — rub lard about your bedsteads to kill and keep 
them free of chintses ; wet cobalt with spirit on a plate, to feed your flies 
with their last meal. Black pepper mixed very stitong with cream and sugar, 
is said to be good for flies. Sprinkle the €lour of sulphur or sage round the 
haunts of ants. The little red ant can no easier crawl over, than leap, a mark

Grateful for past favors, the author wishes this last 
edition, with its corrections and copious additions, may 
prove not less acceptable than the previous editions. 
And flow acceptable those have been, the so rapidly 
passing of the work to its eighth edition, without being 
allowed to go into the book-stores^ gives no equivocal 
proof. 

Various editorial notices, of the most satisfactory cha- 
racter, have been given throughout the entire States, 
and in Canada West, and Canada East. Some of which, 
for the satisfaction of such as have not before had an 
opportunity of examining the work, are subjoined. 
With which notices a comparison of the work itself is

RECOMMENDATIONS. 



The Improtbd House wipb is just such a work as a good, intelligent 
American wife and mother, after thirty years* experience in the great and 
oomprehensive art of housekeening and nursingt would ^ive her dau^ters, 
as the concentrated and available experience of her life, in the duties upon 
which they are about to engage. It will be a pleasing and intelligent and 
profitable companion, and relieve the anxieties of husbands and wives. — 
jBangor Whig and Covrier, 



The great fault with most cook-books is, that th^contemplate too high 
Uvingf so that a frugal housewife cannot use them. This de^t is obviated 
in the present work. It is a guide to economy, as well as to comfort, show- 
ing how to provide excellent dishes from very plain materials ; and is not 
made up of extracts, but is Uie result of more tnan thirty-four years* expe* 
hence on the part of the author. — Boaton Recorder, 



We haiw exanuned the work, and we consider it far superior to any yet 
published, besides being cheaper. Our New-England and Southern ex- 
changes all speak of it as being the best ever puUished. No housekeeper 
should be without it. Sold by the agent only, now in the city. — Detroit 
Free Preee. 



It is the most thorough — the most clear book of its kind extant — Salem 
Advertiser and Argue. 



As a Book qf Redpest we believe " The Improved ffoueewtfe *' to be the 
beet that can be obtained. It contains also some excellent ?unt8. There is 
no reason and no excuse for not having our food properly prepared. There 
is no merit in caring nothing for what we eat. Our food should be prepared 
with reference to our health; and this requires that our meats should be 
rightly cooked, and our bread rightly made. It is neither economical nor 
healthful to turn oflf a family with iood which is left to cook itself. But 
there are a class of young lK>usekeepers who seem to take some pride in 
their iterance of this one great duty of a housekeeper. They are so trained 
by their mothers, and finally inflicted on some unfortunate man, whose only 
resource is to bear it the best way he can. To all such, we recomtnenid 
this book as a partial relief Others, who understand something about the 
duties of a housekeeper, will find it an important aid. — Mother's MagaanSf 
New York. 



Without being well cooked, the best victuals are supplied in vain. It is, 
therefore, essential that every mistress of a family snould be qualified to 
direct her servants in this important particular. An excellent work — con- 
tains ample instructions ; no housekeeper should be without it. — Baltimoro 
CUpper. 



ABCOMlfSNDATiOMS. 288 

T%e Improved Boutea^e contains a great variety of valaable receipts for 
cooking, and for general and domestic economy. We do not know of ft 
"Work so well adapted to its objects, and so fit to be placed in the bands of a 
young housekeeper. It is also on a scale to suit those whose necessities 
demand plain-Uying and frugal housewifery. We can recommend it with 
great heartiness. — Kiehmoitd Christian, Adincate. 



It is a rery valuable and useful b(H>k.-^R»chmjimd RepubUcan. 



It professes to give wh^ is much needed in the domestic circle, an 
economical plan cf preparing food for the table. And, from a hasty glance at 
its pages, as well as from a number of judicious notices we have seen in 
reference to it, we have no doubt it will accomplish all its purposes. The 
▼olume also contains engravings for marketing and carving, two most indis- 
pensable accompaniments to good cooking ; also a variety of new receipts 
on varioQS other snbjects. — Christian Repository, Philaddphia. 



Next to having anv thing good to eat, the most important consideration is 
to have it well cooked and served up. In our mode of cocd^ing we are 
lamentably at fault. This deficiency can well be supplied by %e study of 
The Improved Hotuewi/e. It is a compend of all kincis of receipts, direc- 
tions for carving, extracting grease-spots, stains, &c. It contains a sum 
mary of all the duties of an accomplished housekeeper ; and, if practiced, 
it vnll make perfect. — Macon Messenger, Geo, 



The Improved Housewife presents a variety of useful novelties, rendering 
it superior, in several respects, to the ordinaxy cook-books. In those cases 
"where it treats of the matters usually found in such works, it appears to be 
judicious and economical, giving the actual results of the expenenoe of the 
author. It has a series of drawinp, showing how to purchase meats j a 

ite reduced to their equivalent measures, obviating 



renient table of weights 
the necessity of scales ; dramngs illustfative of carving ; directions for 
•erving a diimer with propriety ; and, what ia of great importance, recipes 
in cookery foir the sick. — Portiand Advertiser. 



This work should be found in every boosehold. It is hist such a one as 
the thr^y housew^e would require. — Charleston SouAem Patriot, 



Its pages possess a fund of information which cannot fail to be useful to 
those who study comfort and economy.— l>emoeralic Unions HBorriahurg. 



If this book had been studied when many of us went to school, our bread 
would have been better made. Hints how to procure the best pieces at 
market, and, after they are well cooked, how to carve them, will be found 
useful. No family library should be without it. — The Georgian, Savannah. 



We cannot be far out of the way in saying, with every body who speaks 
of it, that " The Im^^rot>ed Housewife " ia a capital book of its kind. We 



S86 ASCOMMENDATIONI. 

would reeommend it to all hootfeke^pere who would adeuUie tbe hms ind 
gain of living. — New Orlean» Commercial BvUetm* 



There is a recipe for eTery deacription of cooking, preaerring frtiits, 
keting, making pastry, and destroying vermin, with a laige amoimt of « 
and necessaiy information. — Daily Potty Troy. 

It is altogether the best work of the kind that has fallen under onr eye. 
Buffalo > 



" The improved J9oM4«iiafe."'^Thi8 is the title of an excellent Boole ^ 
Receipts^ with . engravings for marketing and carving, by a married lady, 
Mrs. a. L. Webstkr. It is published in Hartford, Conn., and sold by 
the agent only. The receipts are eimpUt yet rich enough. It is cheap in 
price, and a compZet* guide to comfort and economy. The work is univer- 
sally commended. — Soston Times. 



We find d^ to be invaluable in information of the hidiest importance to 
housekeeping. The receipts have been tried^ and found to be excellent as 
weU as economical.'-^PenMyltiama Tel^raph. 



We commend it as a Class-book in all Female Seminaries^ as well as a 
standard work in all Family Libraries. — N. Y. Tribune. 



TTu Improved Housewife is noticed bv the ladies, the best judges of its 
contents, as a real improveineat on all other works of the kind. — Ckrittiai 
Observer t PhUa. 



It is a neat, convenient volume, in which we find, in addition to the meie 
details of the kitchen, a desJ of sensible and very useful counsel and 
information. Its design is rather to teach judicious ecmunny, than to sid 
useless and unhealthful extravagance. — Phtla. Sat. Courier. 



A very useful volume of receipts, and directions for the culinaiy depart- 
ment of good housekeeping ; ana especially for those who would have their 
food cooked wdl, at a smaU expense. — United States Gazette, PhUa. 



It is pronounced by a female friend to be the very best work upon the 
subjects of which it treats that has ever been published. — North Americatif 
PhOa. 



Most eicellent.— iSoutft Caro^nian^ Columbia, 



This is the most modem publication we have seen on matters in which 
every one has an equal interest. And, after an examination, we are satis- 
fied that it surpasses all its predecessors as a practical guide to the head of 
the culinary department. It is the result of more than thirty-four years' 



RB C.QMM 6NDA.XI0M S . 237 

experience of a lady, who is both theoretically and practically aoqaainted 
with lA subject which she elucidates for the benefit of others. Every pos- 
sible manner in which flesh, fish, vegetables, fruits and breadstuff's can be 
served up, to nourish the body or please the taste, are here brought to view 
in a compendious form, and the instructions plainly given, in terms adapted 
to the comprehension of all persons. When generally known, this book 
"wiU be prized as an indispensable manual to every housekeeper. — Repvb- 
liean Jjuratd, I'rovidenee. 



The Improved Housewife we believe to be the best work of the kind in 

Drint ; and one that should be in the hands of every family. We know 

Miss Leslie's to be an admirable work on housekeeping; but we have 

always deemed her recipes to be too costly for general use. The work 

before us bas met that great fauU ; and Mrs. W., after an experience of more 

than thirty -four years as a practical housekeeper in married life, has mosi 

judiciously adapted her work to an every day family tise. Besides, '* The 

Improved Housewife** contains, in one convenient book, what Miss Leslie has 

spread over four books, and Makenzie over " five thousand receipts ;" and 

sufficient under each respective head, in the one book, for the accomplished 

housekeeper. So far as merit is made the standard of comparison, it is the 

cheapest book of its kind. — Wibnington Chronicle. 



The Improved Housewife, published at Hartford, Conn., is well printed and 
neatl)' bound. And it contains an immense amount of useful information to 
housekeepers, in the way of directions for marketing, recipes for cooking, 
for making preserves, pickles, pastry, &c., with a variety of miscellaneous 
information. The volume also contains a variety of plates, with directions 
for carving, choice of joints of meat, fish, 6ic, We have car^vily looked 
through it, and we find that it has one great advantage over most works of this 
description, inasmuch as its recipes are not eaepensive, but are calculated for 
the kitchens of families in moderate circumstances. This work is not in 
the hands of the booksellers, but is to be had of the agent only, who is now 
in Montreal. — Montreal Courier. 



Of ** The Improved Housewife** we feel warranted in stating that it richly 
merits the rapid sale it has met with. And, no matter how many cook-books 
there may be ia die house, this one book will more than supply the place of 
all ; and without it you are " poor indeed." It is compiled by a married 
lady, mostly from the result of her own personal experience as a house- 
keeper for the last thirty-four years. No housekeeper ought to be without 
it. And many a young married man would find his purse heavier at the end 
of the year, would he but make his better half a present of this truly valua- 
ble work, and thus enable her to ston the leaks in the kitchen, that sieve to 
a man's fortune. — Morning Telegra^ 



It is of essential use to the information and economy of all classes. — 
(descent City, New Orlauis. 



We have only to add our concurrence to the variety and multiplicity of 
editorial notices of The Improved Housewife throughout the States, as the 
best work of its kind. — QueMc Oazetts

At the request of the publisher, the following certificate has been Aimiahed by a

**The edition of the New England Primer, published in 1843 by Mr. Ira Webster,

**The edition of the New England Primer, which has been published by Mr. Ira 
Webster, of Hartford, in the year 1843, is the only genuine and correct edition of that 
raluable and wonderflil book that has been to be obtained for maoy years. It is prob- 
ably more than fifty years since there has been printed a complete and correct edition 
of the Primer, except the one printed by Mr. Webster. His edition is an exact copy 
of the Prhner that was used by families and schools in my youth, sixty years ago, and 
I suppose it had been used for fifty or a hundred years before that time. The geniH 
ine copy of the Primer, on account of its antiquity, and its extensive usefulness in 
former years, lias now become an object of interesting and beneficial curiosity.

PREFACE 



Brbvitt, is one object of the writer — ^not lo multiply 
oooks ; nor to present, even one, large book. But on the 
contrary, by corrections and by new receipts, to improve the 
successive editions; and thus present a useful book, in as 
concise form as possible. 

The obvious want of a suitable text-book for the Culinary 
Department, has induced the writer to prepare this work, 
being mostly the result of personal experience as house- 
keeper, for the last thirty-four years. 

" Most of the receipts now in use, are the result of chance, 
or the whim of a depraved appetite/' Their insufficiency is 
well known, and it has long been the subject of complaint. 

Many new receipts, it is believed, are now for the first time 
presented to the public. Selections have also been made 
from other compilations — such as have been proved to be 
good, by actual trial. 

While this book is intended for all classes of sodety, em- 
bracing receipts both for rich and for plain cooking, it is 
especially intended as a guide to those who would cook welly 
and please the palate at smcdl expense — considerations of no 
small importance at all times* 

In conclusion, — ^the writer would humbly hope that her 
experience may lighten the care, dissipate the perplexities, 
and guide the judgment of all who fill the station, or assume 
the duties of Cook, or of Old or " Young Housekeeper.*' ^ -

rARTICULABS TO BB OBSERYED IN THE SELECTION OF MABXETABLC0. 

Beef, 

The fat should look white rather than yellow. Ox beef 
is the richest. If young, the flesh will have a fine, smooth, 
open grain, be of a good red, and the flesh tender. In 
0maU famihes fine-fed heifer beef is preferred by some. 

Choose the meat of which the kidney is covered with 
white, thick, /rm fat. 

Mutton, 
Judge by fineness of grain, and firmness of white fat. 



MARKETING PLATES. 17 



Lamb. 

If the vein in the neck of the fore quarter is bluish^ it ii 
fresh. 

Pork, 

If young, on pinching the lean it will break ; if fresh, it 
will be smooth and cool. Thin rind is a merit in aU pari. 

Turkey, 

If young, it has a smooth, black leg. ^f fresh, eyes full 
and bright, and feet supple and moist. 

Fowls, 

if young, their comb and legs will be smooth. If fresh, 
the vent will be close and dark. 

Geese. 
Young ones will have yellow bills and feet, and a pin 
head may be easily forced through the skin of the breast. 
If fresh, the feet will be pliable. 

Ducks. 

Select such as have supple feet, and are hard and thick 
on the breast and belly. 

Shad, - 
If good, they are white and thick. 

Herring. 
Gills should be of a fine red ; eyes bright. 

Lobsters. 

The male, though generally smaller, has the highest fla- 
vor ; the flesh is firmer, and the color, when boiled, is a 
deeper red. Known by the narrow back part of the taU, 



18 MARKETING PLATES. 

and its two uppennost fins, wliich are stiff and hard. If 
fresli, the clawd will have a strong motion on pressing the 
eyes with the fingers.* 

Crabs, 

When in perfection, the joints of the legs are stiff, and 
he body has a very agreeable smell. The heaviest are 
the best ; though some prefer the middling sized as the 
sweetest. '

CARVING. 



Sleight, rather than muscular strength, is the secret of 
the art. To carve with ease, and with dispatch, requires 
practice. The observing of others, and attention to the 
following plates, Avill soon enable the practitioner to become 
an adept. The carver should be seated sufficiently ele- 
yatod; so near the dish as not to require efibrtin reaching; 
and should wield, with the greatest facility, a keen blade. 

As a preliminary, see the butcher has made the cleaver 
do its duty faithfully. 

Fish wants but little car^dng. The pieces should bo 
preserved as whole as possible. A fish trowel will be 
found preferable to a knife. 



1. Qod^s Head and Shoulders, 

Introduce the trowel a 
cf, and cut through tht 
back as far as 6, then helj 
to pieces from between < 
and d, and with each pieco 
help a portion of the sound, 
which lines the under par 
of the back bone. It is 

esteemed a delicacy ; is thin, jnd of a darker color than 

the rest of the fish. 

Some persons are fond of the palate and tongue, for 

which you must put a spoon into the mouth. About the 

jaw-bone lies the jelly part, and within the head the firmer 

parts. 




20 



CARVING. 




2. Edge or Aitch Bone of Beef , 

Cut off and lay by 
a thick slice from the 
entire surface, as mark- 
ed a, b, then help. 

There are two kinds 
of fat attached to this 
joint. Know which is 
preferred, as tastes 
differ. The solid lies at e, and must be cut horizontally ; 
that resembling marrow, or the softer, lies at the back of 
the bone, below d. 

A silver skewer should be used, for the one which keeps 
the meat together while boiling ; and may be removed when 
you cut to it. 

3. Sirloin of Beef 

There are two ways 
of carving this joint. 
The better is, by long 
thin pieces from a to c; 
the other way is, which 
spoils it, to cut across. 
The most tender and 
best part lies in the dr- 

rection of the line h. ; there, too, lies some delicate (at. 

Part should be given with each slice. 

4. Ribs of Beef 

These may be sliced like the sirloin, conunencing at the 
thin end and slicing the whole length, so as to give a mix- 
ture of fat and lean. 

5. Round of Beef 

Remove the upper surface, as in the edge bone ; help to 
thin slices, with a portion of fat ; cutting as even as possi- 
ole, to preserve its beauty of appearance. 

6. Tongue, 

Cut perpendicular thin slices, commencing a little nearer 
the root than the tip. The fat lies underside, at the root 




CAKTIMO.

7. Calps Head, 

Cut thin slices from 
a to 5, to the bone. 
The throat sweetbread 
lies at c. SHce from c 
to J, and help that with 
the other part. Should 
the eye be requested: 
extract with the point 
of the knife, and help to a portion. The palate, a delicate 
morsel, lies under the head. The sweet tooth, too, not an 
inferior delicacy, lies back of all the rest, and, in a young 
calf, is easily extracted with the knife. On removing the 
jaw bone, fine lean will appear. Help to each of these. 

8. Shoulder of Mutton. 

Slice to the bone at 
the line a, and help 
thin pieces from each 
side. The choice fat 
lies at the outer edge, 
at h. Should more be 
needed than can be 
gotten from those 
parts, slice on either 
side of the line c, which represents the blade bone ; and 
nice pieces may be obtained. From the under side, also, 
by slicing horizontally. 

9. Leg of Mutton. 

The nicest part 
lies at a, midway be- 
tween the knuckle 
and the other end. 
Thence, cut thin 
slices each way, as 
deep as h. The out- 
side being seldom 
very fat, some favorite pieces may be sliced off the broad 

3 





CARVINQ. 




«iid &t €, The knuckle is tender ; but the other part moro 
juicy. Some good slices may be cut lengthwise, from th« 
broad end of the back of the leg. The cramp bone is much 
thought of by some : to get it, cut down to the bone at d, 
and in the curve line to e. 

Spare Rih. 

Carve, first, slices from 
the fleshy part, tracing the 
line a, b. This will give a 
proportion of lean and fat; 
and being removed, sepa« 
rate the rib, placed in the 
direction J, 5, c ; breaking it at the point c. If an entire 
rib is too much, a slice of meat may be taken from between 
two ribs. 

11. Leg of Pork.— [See Ham.] 

The stufEng, in a roast leg, will be found under the skiui 
at the thick end. 

12. Fore Quarter of Lamb, 

Separate, first, the shoul* 
der from the scoven, which 

dl J„..L _^.rfifgy"- llli/,i(i constitutes the ribs 'and the 

breast, by sliding the knife 
under the knuckle, in the 
direction of a, 5, c, leaving 
on the ribs a due proportion of meat. Place it on a difierent 
dish. Now squeeze half a Seville orange on the other 
part, which, being sprinkled with salt and pepper, should be 
carved in the direction e, d. This will separate the gristly 
part from the ribs. Now help from either, as may be the 
choice, carving as directed by the lines e, /. 

Saddle of Mutton. 

Cut long slices, on each side 
of the back bone, in the direc*' 
tion a, b. As some are fond of 
a joint of the tail, they can 
easily be serv«d by cutting 
between the joints. 



s s 





GAEYINa. 





14, Breast of Veal. 

Separate the ribs from 
the brisket by cutting 
through the' line a, i. The 
brisket is the thickest part, 
and of a gristly substance. Carve each ; and help accord- 
ing to preference. 

15. Fillet of Veal 

This resembles a round 
of beef. Like that, it 
should be canred hori-- 
zontally, or by taking 
thin even slices from the 
top, cutting deep into the 

flap, between a, i, for 

the stuffing. Help to each person a portion of the dressing. 

16. Pig. 

This is seldom sent to the 
table whole; the cook first 
garnishing the dish with the 
chops and ears, and dividing 
the body lengthwise. Sepa* 
rate a shoulder from the body ; next a leg ; and divide the 
ribs. The joints may be divided, or the meat sliced from 
them. Some prefer the neck, though most the ribs. Help 
with stuffing and gravy. 

If the head is not otherwise disposed of, the brains should 
be mixed with the gravy. 

17. Venison. 

Slices of a medium 
thickness may be giv- 
en, and plenty of gravy 
with them . Cut quite 
to the bone in the line 
a, c,b ; then turn the 
dish with the end 6, towards you, and putting in the point 





•A&TIMO. 



of the knife at e, cut as deep as possible in the direction 
e, d. You may now, at pleasure, slice from either side. 
As the fat lies deeper on the left, those who like fat, as 
most venison eaters do, may be helped to the best flavored 
and fatest slices on the left of the line c, d. 




18. Ham, 

Ham may be carved 
three different ways. 
Usually, commencing 
by long* delicate pieces, 
cut to the bone wrough 
the thick fat, in the line 
a, h, A second way is, 
to cut a small round hole 
on the top, as at c, tak- 
The most saving way is to begin 




ing thin circular pieces, 
at the knuckle. 



19. A Fowl 

It will be more con- 
^^ venient carving this to 
take itonto your plate, ^ 
replacing the joints, as 
^a separated, neatly on the 
dish. Place the fork 
in the middle of the 
breast, and remove the wing in the direction of a, b, sepa- 
rating the joint at a, and lifting up the pinion with the fork, 
and drawing the entire wing towards the leg. This draw- 
ing will separate the fleshy part more naturally than cutting. 
Cut between the leg and the body at c, to the joint b. By 
giving the blade a sudden turn the joint will break. Re- 
peat the same operation for the other wing and leg. Next, 
take off the merrythought by drawing the knife across the 
breast and turning the joint back ; and then remove the 
two neck bones. Divide the breast from the back, by cut 
ting through all the ribs, close to the breast. Turn the 
back up ; half way between the extreme ends press the 
point of the knife, and on raising the rump end the bone 




CAKYINO. 2& 

will part. Take off the sidesmen, having turned the romp 
from you : — and done. 

The winga should be made as handsome as possible. 
These, with the breast, are the most delicate parts of the 
ibwl ; the legs are more juicy. 

20. A Goose. 

With the neck end to- 
ward you, to take off the 
wing, put the -fork into the 
. small end of the pinion and 
press it close to the body, 
divide the joint at a, carrying the knife along as far as b. 
Take off the leg by an incision from & to c, and separate 
the drumstick. Part the wing and leg from the other side, 
and between the lines 1 and 2, cut long slices from each 
side of the breast. The apron must be removed by cutting 
from (/ to e, by c, to get at the stuffing. The menTthought 
being removed, the neck bones, and all other parts are to 
be divided as in a fowl. 

A Duck may be carved in a similar manner. 

21. Turkey. 

To carve, without withdrawing the fork, place your fork 
firmly in the lower part of the breast, so as to have the 
turkey at perfect command. It is not difficult to complete 
the entire carving of this fowl without extracting the fork 
till done : the whole back, of course, making one joint. 
Proceed to remove the wing ; the leg ; another wing and 
leg. (This may be done, either before, or after, slicing 
the breast.) Next, remove the merrythought, the neck 
bones, the, neck itself; then, cutting through the ribs, the 
job is done. 

22. Partridge. 

Canf ed as a fowl. Wings, breast, and merrythought, are 
the best parts. The two latter not often divided. Th« 
wing the best joint. The tip the very best. 

3* 



96 CAKTIKO. 



23. Pigeons. 
Halve them, dividing lengthwise ; or so as to make the 
breast and wings form one division. The lower division 
generally preferred. 

Woodcocks^ Grouse^ ^e. are carved like fowls, if not 
ux> small ; when they must be cut in quarters. 

Snipes should only be halved. 

24. Hare. 

Insert the pomt of th« 
knife inside the shoulder a 
a, and separate the entire 
length to the rump at b 
The other side being done 
in the same way, the hare 
is in three pieces. Slide 
the knife under the rise of the shoulder at a, b, to remove- 
it. Serve the leg in a similar manner. Next, decapitate. 
Take off the ears close ; and separate the jaws. Place the 
upper jaw flat on a plate, and putting the point of the knife 
into the forehead, bisect it through the centre of the cra- 
nium to the extreme end of the proboscis. Cut the back 
into convenient portions ; lay the pieces neatly on the dish, 
and proceed to serve the company, giving some stuffing, 
(which will be found inside the hare,) and gravy to each 
person. 

The back and legs are prime parts. By some, the ears 
are considered a luxury. So also the head and brains. 
The tail is a rare delicacy. They may be distributed to 
those who like them. 

Should the hare not be very tender, it will be difficult to 
divide the sides from the back ; but take off the legs by 
cutting through the joints. You will then be able to cut a 
few slices from each side of the back. Next, dissever the 
shoulders, which are called the sportsman's joints, and are 
preferred by many. The back, <fec. m^ay then be carved 
as directed above.

invoked ; you will dispatch soup to each, from a pile of 
plates on your right, without questioning any whether you 
shall help them or not. Dealing it out silently ; you will 
l\(Blp the' person at your right hand, first ; then at y9ur left, 
and so on. 

You will carve the meats yourself, of course. And you 
will not ask to be allowed to help your guests^ but will 
supply a plate in silence, and hand it to your servants, who 
will offer it to such of the company as are unprovided. 
Never offer fish or soup a second time. 

If a dish be on the table, some parts of which are pre- 
ferred to others, according to the taste of individuals, all 
should have the opportunity of choice. Simply ask each 
one if he has any preference for a particular part. If the 
reply is in the negative, do not repeat the question, nor 
insist that he must have a preference. So, where different 
. dishes ; do not insist on your guests pjirtaking of a particular 
dish, nor ask persons more than once. Never force a sup- 
ply upon their plates. 

Do not attempt to eulogize your dishes, nor to apologize 
that you cannot recommend them. 

As Guest. — Being seated, when soup is ofiered take it ; 
but if you prefer fish, pass it to your neighbor. You must 
not ask for soup or fish a second time. 

If asked whether you have a preference for any dish, or 
any particular part of a dish, answer plainly and distinctly, 
«8 you wish. 



28 A WORD FOR THE BINNBR-TABLE.

Finally, to be at ease, is a great step toward enjoying 
your own dinner, and making yourself agreeable to the 
company 

'He Servanif should serve sYory thing at the Irfi hand

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. 



For most preparations, it is easier to measure tliaa to 
weigh. 

25. Solids, 

Butter, when soft, one pound ... is one quart. 

Eggs, .... ten are one pound. 

Flour, Wheat, • . one pound ... is one quart 
Meal, Indian, . . one pound two ounces is one quarts 
Sugar, best Brown, one pound two ounces is one quart. 
Sugar, Loaf, broken, one pound ... is one quart.

26. Lipids. 

Four Spoonfuls are half a gill. 

Eight Spoonfuls are ...... one giU. 

Two Gills, or sixteen Spoonfuls are . half a pint. 

Two Pints are one quart. 

Four Quarts are one gallon. 

Twenty-five Drops are one teaspoonful. 

Four Spoonfuls are one wineglassfid. 

Twelve Spoonfuls are . . . . . . ^ one teacupful. 

Sixteen Spoonfuls, or half a Pint, are . one tumblerful or 

coffee-cup. 
"Whenever the word spoonful or spoonfuls, is used, in this 
work, a large, or tahle-spoon, is meant. But as measures 
of the same name differ in capacity, it will require judg- 
ment and practice to be familiar with due proportions. 



so WEIGHTS AND MSASU&BS. 

So, aho, in tho regulation of fires ; and the time requisite 
for cooking a given article. This may suffice for all the 
preparations, as presenting a general standard of compari- 
sons, from which, deviations may be made at pleasure, ac- 
cording to variety of tastes, and difference of means. ^' Q. 
£. D." And it requires no other demonstration than the 
taste, to prove that the better the parts, the better the whole 
of any compound. 

N. B. -Correct the common notion, entertained only by 
the ignorant, that if a cook book is purchased, the expense* 
of the table must necessarily be increased; as though doing 
iny business by ndcy enhanced the eiqpense. 



MEATS 



Though the marketing and the carving, have been 
deemed of sufficient importance to give them the few pages 
allotted to them ; yet compared with the disposition^ or the 
use made, of what comes into the hands of the housekeeper, 
these pages are but blank paper. The interim, the time 
between the marketing and the serving out, may emphatic 
cally be styled the housekeeper's time. \ 

When the weather will admit of it, meat will improve by \ 
keeping ; beef and mutton a week, in cold weather, and 
poultry half as long. It will soon spoil in hot weather. 
It should be kept away from flies ; where cool and airy ; 
and if in danger of spoiling, rub over it a little fine salt, a|id 
sprinkle with pepper. •It will not cook well, if frozen when 
put to the fire, either to boil or to roast. It should be 
soaked in cold water till the frost is extracted. Furious 
boiling hardens meat. Put the part that is to be up at table, 
down in the. pot, with just cold water enough to cover it ; 
and boil gently. The scum should be taken off as soon as 
it rises. The slower the boiling, the tenderer the meat. 
As a general rule, do not let the vessel stop boiling till its 
contents are cooked. The observance of this rule is indis- 
pensible for ^ood puddings, potatoes, &c. Replenish with 
boiling water, if the addition of water be necessary. 

When thickened and seasoned, the liquor in which all 

kinds of fresh meat are boiled, makes a good soup. Thus 

' used, boiling is the cheapest way of cooking meat. Other-< 

wise, the dearest ; as most of the gelatine is extracted and 

lost. 

In roasting meat, the juices and fat are only extracted, 
but not lost, as they make good gravy ; and the fat is used 

* It keeps coolest and best in a stone pot. 



8S MEATS. 

for Tarious purposes. When pat down to roast, there should 
be a little water in the dripping pan. 

For braiUng, the gridiron should be perfectly *clean, and 
oiled with lard or butter, to prevent the impression of the 
bars on the meat. The bars should be concaye, terminat* 
ing in a trough, to save the juices, and thus prevent smoking 
the meat by the burning of the drippings. The gridiron 
should be heated before the meat is laid on it ; and a good 
fire of live coals is necessary, to have the meat broU as 
quick as possible, without burning. The receiving dish 
should be very hot, and the meat not seasoned till placed . 
upon it. 

To fry meat, first, slice a small piece of pork, and fiy a 
light brown, and take up. Then, put in your meat, per- 
fectly dry. When done enough, take it up. Remove the 
pan to cool ; when cool, turn in a little cold water for the 
gravy, and place it on the fire ; when it boils, stir in a little 
mixed flour and water; let it boil; then pour it over the 
meat. Add butter and catsup, if not rich enough. 

27. Roast Beef. 

The best pieces for roasting, as will be seen by looking 
at the engraving, are the tenderloin, and the first and second 
rib cuts. The two next are good. 

The bony sides should first be placed towards the fire, 
on putting the meat down, with a little salt sprinkled over 
the whole. After the bones are well heated through, turn 
the meat, and keep a brisk fire. While roasting, baste it 
often. When the meat is put down, a little water should 
be put into the dripping pan. 

A thick piece of meat requires fifteen or twenty nunutes 
to the pound, to roast ; if a thin piece, fewer minutes will 
do it. 

28. Roast Beef, Southern Mode. 

Select a rib roasting-piece, that has hung ten of fourteen 
days ; bone it nicely ; rub salt over it ; roll it tight ; bind it 

* To avoid repetition, it needs but be mentioned herCf that every thing 
pertaining to cookery should be perfectly clean, not ez( epting operatoc 
nor operatress. 



liSATs. at 

around with twine ; put the spit through the inner fold, 
without sticking it into the flesh ; skewer, and roast it well ; 
dredge and froth it, when about done ; and garnish with 
•craped horse radish. 

29. Beefsteak, Broiled, 

The round and clod make good steaks, but the inside of 
the sirloin is the best. 

Lay the steak on a gridiron, placing it on a bed of hot 
coals, and broil as quick as possible without burning. From 
fifleen to twenty minutes will be required. Turn it often. 

For eight pounds of beef, cut up from three to five ounces 
of butter ; heat the platter very hot, that is to receive the 
steak; lay the butter on it; take up the steak; salt and 
pepper both sides. To be good, it should be eaten imme- 
diately while hot. Very little butter, if a few slices of salt 
pork be^ broiled with, the beef, will make ^ good gravy. 

30. Beef Steak, Southern Mode. 

For steaks, the best part is the seventh and eighth ribs ; 
Ihe fat and lean being better mixed, and more tender than 
the rump. 

Cut them half an inch thick, and beat them a little ; broil 
quick, turning them often ; have u dish very hot ; put some 
slices of onion in it ; lay in the steaks ; sprinkle a little 
salt ; pour on them one spoonful of water, and one of mush-* 
room catsup, boiling hot ; garnish with scraped horse radish ; ' 
and put on a hot dish-cover. 

31, Beef Steak, Fried. 

Such pieces as are good for broiling, are also good for 
frying. 

Brown a few pieces of salt pork ; take them up ; put in 
your beef; when brown on both sides, take it up and re- 
moye the pan to let the fat cool. When cool, pour in four 
spoonfuls of water ; mix two teaspoonfuls of flour with a 
little water; mix it with the fat; replace the pan pn the 
fire ; stir it till it boils up ; pour it over the beef.

M MEATS. 

32. Liver, 
Beers liver is good fried, but is best broiled about tea 
minutes, with salt pork ; then cut both into small strips ; 
put them in a stew pan, with a little water, butter, and pep- 
per ; stew about five minutes. First, scald the liver. 

33. Alamode Beef. 

The round is best. The shoulder clod is cheapest ; is 
good, too, stewed without spices. 

For five pounds of alamode beef, soak a pound of bread 
in cold water till soft, turn ofi* the water, mash the bread 
fine ; add a piece of butter of a hen's egg size, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of ground cloves, of all- 
spice, of pepper, half a nutmeg, two eggs, and a spoonful 
of flour : mix all well together ; gash the beef; fill with 
half the dressing ; place it in a bake pan, with lukewarm 
water enough to cover it ; cover the pan with the lid heated, 
and set it where it will stew gently two hours ; then turn 
on the top the other half of the dressing, and heat the lid 
hot enough to brown it. Stew an hour and a half longer. 
On taking up the meat, if the gravy is not thick enough, 
mix, with a little water, a teaspoonful or two of flour, and 
stir into the gravy ; add a little butter, and a glass of wine, 
and turn it over the meat. 

34. To Frizzle Beef, 

Shave off" very thin pieces of tender, fresh smoked beef ; 
put them in a stew pan, with just sufficient water to cover 
them, and let them stew ten or fifteen minutes. ~ Three or 
four minutes before taking up, stir in a mixture of a little 
flour and water, to thicken the water, adding a little pepper 
and butter. A good dish for breakfast — accompanied with 
eggs, still better. 

35. BoUed Beef 
The perfection in boihng beef is, to boil slowly, and to 
skim the pot well. If the scum boil in, by adhering to the 
meat, it causes a dirty appearance. The boiling may at 
any time be checked^ by removing partially, or entirely, th# 
pot lid. 



MEATS. 86 

In hot weather, it is so difficult to keep beef sweet, it i| 
best to com it in the pot, as it is boiled. Put in a teacup 
of salt to eight pounds of beef; sprinkle flour on the side 
that is Xo lay up on the dish, and lay it down in the pot ; 
pour water into the pot, enough to cover the meat, an4 
keep it covered, afler the meat is put in. Boil two hours ; 
add more cold water, and boil another hour and a half. ^ 

36. To Collar a Flank of Beef. 

Take a select flank of beef; rub it well with salt and a 
large portion of saltpetre ; let it lie ten days ; then wash it 
clean ; remove the inner and outer skin, with the gristle : 
spread it on a board, and cover the inside with the follow^ 
ing mixture ; sage, parsley, thyme chopped fine, pepper^ 
salt, and pounded cloves. Roll it up ; sew over it a cloth ; 
bandage that with tape ; boil gently, from isve to six hours ; 
take it out ; when cold, place it on a board without undoing 
it ; put another board on the top, with a heavyweight on it ; 
let it lay twenty-five hours ; take ofif the bandages ; cut a 
slice from each end ; garnish with sprigs of parsley and 
green pickles, and serve it up. 

37. Curries, 

Veal, Mutton chops, chickens, pigeons, and lobsters, all 
make good curries. Joint your fowls, if a fowl curry-dish 
is to be made ; boil them in barely sufficient water to cover 
them, till tender ; add a little salt. Fry, till brown, three 
or four slices of pork, just before the fowls are done enough 
to take up. Take up the pork, and put in the chickens ; 
brown them ; then add part of the liquor in which they 
were boiled, a teaspoonful or two of curry powder, and this 
fried pork. Mix a teaspoonM of liurry powder with twelve 
spoonfuls of boiled rice, or with a mixture of a little flour 
and water ; pour it on the curry, and stew a few minutes. 

38. Sweetbread, Heart, and Liver. 

Fry sweetbread, moderately, where two or three pieces 
of salt pork have been browned and taken up. On remov- 
ing the^ sweetbread, stir into the fat two teaspoonfuls of 
flour mixed with a little water. On boiling, pour it over the 
sweetbread. 



M MBAT8. 

Anciher way. — Parboil the sweetbread ; let it gel cold ; 
IJBde it in inch thick pieces ; dip them in the yolk of an 
tgg and fine bread crumbs, first sprinkled with pepper, salt» 
and fine sage ; brown them lightly. Mixing smooth, a little 
Ayor and water, make a grayy by stirring diem into the fat. 
Add spices and wine if liked. 

The heart and liter may be cooked in the same way. 

39. To Brottn Mincer Meat. 
Miiice cold roast beef very fine, fat and lean ; add salt, 
pepper, chopped onion, and a little gravy ; fill scollop tins 
two-thirds full, and fill up with potatoes mashed smooth 
widi cream ; lay a piece of butter on the top, and brown 
them in an oven. 

40. Tripe. 

After being thoroughly scoured, tripe should be soaked 
in salt uid water about a week, shifting the water every 
eight and forty hoturs ; then boil till tender, or from eight to 
ten hc^ui^ ; then pickle, fty or broil. Pickle it the same as 
souse. 

41. Meats Warmed Over. 

Roasted or boiled veal makes a good dish, chopped Hiie 
and Just moistened with wat^r, seasoned with a little butter, 
pepper, and salt, ttA warmed up^ A little nutmeg and the 
yelbw part of a lemon rind, grated fine^ in^irove it. When 
well heated, take it up, and garnish it with two lemons cut 
In slices. 

Salt or i^sh beef is good, chom>ed fine, trith boiled po« 
tatoee, uid warmed up with a little water, pej^eri and sidt ; 
add a little butter just before you tdie it up. 

Boiled turnips, or onions, instead of potatoes^ are good 
Bflbted with miiiced meat. 

Mutton, lamb, and veal, are good cut into small strips, 
and warmed witili boiled potatoes sliced, with a little water, 
salt, and pepper ; add butter just before taking up. 

Rare roast beef and mutton are nice sliced and just 
warmed on a gridiron. 

Meat that is warmed over, should be on the fire just Icmg 
enough to heat through. 



MBAT8. 37 

Cold fowls are fine, jointed and wanned with a little water, 
then taken up and fried brown in a little butter. Sprinkle 
a little fiour on them before frying. Thicken the water in 
which the fowls were warmed, adding butter, P^PP^^i uid 
salt, and then turn it on the fowls. 

43. VeaJ. 

The best piece of veal for roasting is the loin. The 
hreast and rack are good also. The breast makes a good 
potpie, and the rack is good, cut into pieces and broiled. 
The leg is fine for frying ; and after several slices have 
been ti^en off for cutlets, the rest is nice for boiling with a 
piece of salt pork. 

43. Roast Veal 

For roasting, veal should be peppered, salted, rubbed 
over with a little butter, and frequently basted. A little 
water should be put in the dripping pan, and if the meat is 
not quite fat, a little butter shoiild be added. 

44. Baked Veal. 

For baking, the fillet is good. The bone should be cut 
out, and its place filjed with a dressing made of bread 
soaked soft in cold water, two eggs, pepper, salt, and a 
spoonful of melted butter, then sewed up. Put it in the 
bake pan, with a pint of water; and, with some of the dress- 
ing, cover the top of the meat. When done, on taking up, 
thicken the gravy with a little fiour and water well mixed, 
putting in a small piece of butter, and a little wine and cat- 
sup, if a rich gravy is liked. 

45. Veal and Chicken Potpie. 
Joint the chickens, if made of them, and boil them till 
half done ; take them out ; put them, dry, into a pot, making 
alternate layers of crust and fowl, seasoned with pepper 
and salt ; then, pour in the liquor in which the fowls were 
boiled, upon the upper layer of crust, which covers the 
fowls. If a brown crust is desired : with a heated bake 
pan lid, keep the pot covered. Add, from the teakettle, 
boiling water, as that in the pot wastes. Raised piecrust 
is preferable to that made for fruit pies, though, if but little 

4* 



88 lllfiATS. 

(khoiteiied, that is good. For raised crust, mix a teaspoon- 
fid ^salt,aDdateaciipof melted butter, with three pints of 
flour, a&d thea pour m half a teacup of yeast, adding cold 
water to make it stiff enough to roll out; placing it where 
warm, it will require from seren to eight hours to xisei un- 
less you use brewer's yeast. Roll it out, when risen, and 
cat it into small cakes. 

Potato pie crtist is good. Peel and mash fifte eight 
boiled potatoes ; mix wi& them half a pint of milk, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a hen's egg size piece of butter, and flour 
enough for rolling out. Put with the meat, the cakes after 
rolled out and cut. 

By working into unbaked wheat dough, a little m^ted 
lukewarm butter, nice crust may be made. Before putting 
it w^th the meat, let it lay ten or fifteen minutes, afVer it ia 
cut and rolled into cakes. 

46. Ve€^ Cutlets. 

Fiy, till brown, three or four slices of salt pork ; take 
them up, and put in slices of veal, cut from the leg, about 
an inch thick ; when brown on both sides, take them up ; 
stir into the gravy, half a pint of water, and mix two or 
three teaspoonfuls of flour with a little water, and stir in ; 
soak two jslices of toasted bread in the gravy ; lay them on 
the bottom of the platter ; place the meat and pork over 
them, and turn on the gravy. 

A very nice way of cooking cutlets is, with half a pint 
of milk, an egg beaten to a froth, and flour enough to ren- 
der it thick, to make a batter. When fried brown, dip the 
veal into the batter, then replace it in the fat, and fry until 
it is brown again. If any batter is left, it is fine dropped 
by spoonfuls into the fat and fried brown, and placed over 
the veal. Thicken the gravy, and turn it*over the whole. 
This dish requires an hour's cooking ; and it will be best to 
■tew the meat half an hour before frying it, if it is tough. 

47. To Broil Calfs Liver, 

Cut the liver in slices, not very thin ; salt and pepper it, 
after nicely broiling, and pour on some melted butter, witL 
ehofiped parsley, after it is dished. 



MBATff. M 



48. Force Meat BaUs. 

Mix, with a pound of fine chopped veal, one egg, a little 
butter, or raw pork chopped fine, and season with salt and 
pepper, or curry powder. Fry them brown, done up in 
small balls. 

49. Calf's Head. 

With the lights and feet, boil the head about two hours, 
and the liver forty minutes. Tie the brains in a bag and 
boil them with the head, before it is done. When all are 
done, take them up ; season them with butter, salt^ pepper, 
and sweet herbs, or spices if liked, and use them as a 
dressing for the head. Part of the liver, and of the feet, 
iiiay be prepared like the brains, for such as prefer them, 
for a dressing. 

The liquor that the head is boiled in makes a nice soup, 
prepared in a plain way, like any other veal soup, or tur- 
tleized. It should stand till the next day, that the fat may 
be skimmed off which rises. ^ 

To have the head look brown, take it up when tender ; 
rub a little butter over it ; sprinkle on allspice, pepper, salt, ^ 
and fiour, and place it before the fire, under a Dutch oven, 
or in a brick one where it will brown quick. With a little 
■water, salt, pepper, and butter, warm up the brains. Add 
spices and wine if liked. Serve it up as a dressing for the ' 
head. 

Baked calf's head is also good. Halve, and rub butter 
over it ; put it in a pan, with a quart of water ; then cover 
it with a dressing made of bread soaked soil, a little butter, 
and an egg, seasoned with salt, pepper, and pulverized 
mace. Slice up the brains, and place them, with the head, 
in the pan. Bake it in a quick oven, and gariiish with 
force meat balls, or with slices of lemon. 

60. Calf s Feet, 

Boiling them with the head, till both are tender, split, and 
lay them round it ; or, after boiling them tender, and dredg- 
ing them with flour, fry them brown. If a gravy for them 
is wished : after taking them up, stir some flour into the fat 



40 MEATS. 

in wliich they were fried ; season to taste, adding butter, 
and wine if wished, then turn the gravy over the meat. 

51. Scotch CoUops. 

Take some very thin pieces of beef or veal ; rub with 
butter the bottom of an iron stewpan that has a cover to 
closely fit it ; put in the meat, some pepper, salt, a large 
onion, and an apple minced very fine ; cover the pan, and 
let the meat stew till very tender. Serve it hot. 
*» ♦ * 

52. To Grin a Calfs Head. ^ 

^- Clean and divide the head as for mock turtle ; take out 
the brains and tongue ; boil the head tender ; take the eyes 
out whole, and cut the flesh from- the. skull part in smidl 
pieces. Take some of the water the head was boiled in 
for gravy ; add to this gravy, cayenne pepper, salt, a grated . 
nutmeg, and a spoonful of lemon piclde : simmer this till 
the gravy is weU flavored. Next, take the chop, pick out 
the bones ; cover it with bread crumbs, chopped parsley, 
pepper, and salt, and set it in the oven to brow^ Then, 
thicken the gravy with the yolks of two eggs and a spoon- 
ful of butter rubbed into two of flour, and stew the skull 
part in it a few mimites ; put this part on the dish ; and 
complete the whole dish by placing the grilled chop on it, 
garnishing with brain cakes, a^pid broiled sweetbread. 

53. Veal Olives. % ^ 

Cut thin slices otf a fillet, and flatten them ; season them 
highly with pepper, salt, mace, and grated lemon peel ; roll 
up in each slice a bit of fat and tie it with a thread. Fry 
them of a light brown, and stew them in white stock, (pre- 
pared for soups or gravies,) with two dozen of fried oysters, 
a glass of white wine, a spoonful of lemon pickle, and some 
small mushrooms. Stew them nearly an hour. Take the 
threads ofl" before serving. 

54. Ragout of Cold Veal. 
Cut a neck, loin, or fillet of veal into handsome cutlets ; 
put clean drippings, or a piece of butter, into a frying pan ; 
when it is hot, flour, and fry the veal of a light brown; take

tt out ; and if you have no gravy prepared make the follow 
ing : put a pint of boiling water into the frying pan ; let it 
boil up a minute, aad strain it into a basin while you make 
a thickening; put about an ounce of butter into a stew pan; 
when it melts, mix with it sufficient flour to absorb the but- 
ter ; stir it over the fire a few minutes, and gradually add 
the gravy made in the frying pan ; let them simmer together 
about ten minutes ; season it with pepper, salt, a littlo mace, 
and a glass of wine, or mushroom catsup ; strain it through 
a tamis, (coarse cloth strainer,) on to the meat, and stew 
the meat very gently till it is thoroughly warmed. Slices 
of boiled ham may be warmed with the meat. 

55. Mutton, 

Mutton is in its greatest perfection from August to Christ- 
mas. For roasting or boiling allow fifteen minutes for each 
pound. The saddle should always be roasted, and gar- 
nished with scraped horse radish. The leg and shoulder 
are good roasted ; but the best way of cooking the leg is to 
boil it with a bit of salt pork. If a little rice is boiled with 
si the fiesh will look whiter. 

For roasting, mutton should have a little butter rubbed 
over it, and salt and pepper sprinkled on it. Allspice and 
cloves, some like. Put a piece of butter in the dripping pan, 
and baste it often. The bony part should first be presented 
to the fire, for roasting. 

The leg is good to bake, gashed and filled with a dress- 
ing made of soaked bread, pepper, salt, butter, and two eggs. 
A pint of water, and a little butter should be put in the pan. 

The leg is good, too, sliced and broiled. Also boiled, 
alter corned a few days. 

The rack is good for broiling. Each bone should be 
separated, broiled quick, buttered, salted, and peppered. 

The breast is fine baked. The joints of the brisket 
should be separated ; the sharp ends of the ribs sawed ofif ; 
the outside rubbed over with a small piece of butter ; salted ; 
and put into a bake pan, with half a pint of water. When 
baked enough, take it up, and thicken the gravy with a little 
fiour and water, adding a small piece of butter. A spoonfiil 
of catsup, cloves and aBspice, improve it. The neck makes 
a good soup. 



48 MBATI 

For mutton, parsley makes a suitable garnish; or celery 
heads. 

56. To Harricot Mutton, 
Take the best part of the rack ; divide it into chops, one 
bone in each ; beat them flat ; sprinkle pepper and salt on 
them, and broil them nicely. Make a rich gravy out of the 
coarser parts ; season well with pepper, spice, and catsup ; 
strain it when done ; and thicken with butter and brown 
flour. Have ready some carrots and turnips cut into small 
dice and boiled tender : put them in the gravy, and lay 
the chops in, and stew all fiileen minutes. Garnish widi 
green pickles, and serve up. 

67. Shoulder of Lamh^ Grilled, 

Cut the shoulder, moderately deep, in checkers an inch 
long ; rub the yolk of an egg and a Uttle butter over it ; roll 
it in finely powdered bread crumbs ; sprinkle on pepper, 
salt, and sweet herbs, and roast it a light brown. Use for 
it plain gravy, or the following : — Set on the fire, a gill of 
water with a gill of the drippings from the meat, and when 
it boils, thicken it with a little flour and water, adding a 
spoonful of tomato catsup, with the grated rind and juice 
of a lemon, seasoning with pepper and salt. 

58. LamVs Fry, 
The sweetbread and heart are good fried plainly, or dip- 
ped into an egg and fine bread crumbs. Fry in lard. 

59. Irish Stew, 

Take five thick mutton chops, or two pounds of the neck 
or loin, two pounds of potatoes peeled and halved, and half 
a pound of onions peeled and sUced : first, place a layer of 
potatoes at the bottom of ^your stew pan ; Uien, two chops 
and some of the onions ; repeat this process till the pan is 
quite full ; add half a spoonful of pepper, a spoonful of salt, 
diree gills of gravy, and two teaspoonfuls of mushroom 
catsup ; cover so close as to prevent the escape of steam, 
and stew, on a very slow fire, an hour and a half. A slice 
of ham improves the dish very much. Take care it does 
not burn. 



MBATS. 4t 



60. Pork SUaks. 

Slice them from a neck or loin ; trim tliem handsomely, 
and pepper them ; broil them twenty minutes over a clear 
fire, taming them frequently. When done, salt and butter 
them on the plate. 

61. To Broil Ham. 

Ham is better broiled than fried. Slice it thin, and broil 
die slices on a gridiron. When dished, placo a fried egg 
on each slice, and serve out. . It should be bi'oiled, over 
bright hot coals, from five to eight minutes, turning it once. 

62. To Bod Ham. 

Put it on in cold water, and let it simmer, without boil- 
ing, unless very moderately, four or five hours. The water 
should be changed if the ham is very salt. Before it is 
carried to the table, take off the rind. Put over it whole 
pepper or cloves in diamond figures, if you wish to ornament 
it. A ham, if very dry, should be soaked from twelve to 
twenty-four hours in warm water before cooking. 

63. To Toast Ham. 

After boiling it well, t^e the skin off; cover the, top 
thick with bread crumos, and brown ii in an oven 

64. To Stuff Ham. 

Take a ham well smoked* and washed, and make inci- 
sions all over the top two inches deep; stuff them ^m// with 
chopped parsley and some pepper. Do not take off the 
skin. £at it cold, after boiled. 

65. Baked or Roast Pig. 

Take out the inwards ; take off the first joint of the feet ; 
boil both tender, and chop them. Make a dressing of bread 
soaked soft, the water pressed out, and mashed fine ; season 
with pepper, salt, and sage, adding a little butter, and then 
fill the pig with Ais stuffing. To prevent blistering, rub a 
little butter on the outside of the pig. Roast or bake it two 
and a half or three hours. The pan, in which the pig is 



44 MEATS. 

baked should contain a little water. When done, mix, with 
a little dressing and gravy from the pan, the chopped feet 
and inwards, salted, peppered, and buttered, and use this 
for a sauce. Expose the pig to the open air two or three 
minutes, first rubbing it over with a little butter, before it 
is put on the table, to make it crisp. 

66. To Barbacue Shoot. — A Southern^ Disk 

Shoat means a fat young hog, headless and footless, cut 
into four quarters, each weighing six pounds. Make seve- 
ral incisions between the ribs of a fore quarter, and stuff it 
with rich force meat ; put it in a pan with a pint of water, 
salt, pepper, two cloves of garlic, a tumber of good red wine, 
and one of mushroom catsup; bake it, and thicken the 
gravy with brown flour and butter. To facilitate the carv- 
ing, joint and cut the ribs before cooking. Lay the ribs up 
in the dish. If not sufficiently brown, add a little burnt 
sugar to the gravy. Garnish with balls. 

67. Souse. 

Clean pig's feet and ears thoroughly, and soak them a 
number of days in salt and water ; boil them tender, and 
split them. They are good fried. 

To souse them cold, pour boiling vinegar over them, 
spiced with mace and pepper-corns. Cloves give them a 
dark color, but they improve their taste. If a little salt be 
added, they will keep good, pickled, for a month or two. 

68. Pressed Head. 

Boil the several parts of the entire head, and the feet, ia 
the same way as for souse. All must be boiled so perfectly 
tender as to have the meat easily separate from the bones. 
After neatly separated, chop the meat fine, while warm, 
seasoning with salt, and pepper, and other spices to taste. 
Put it in a strong bag, and, placing a weight on it, let it 
remain till cold. Or put it in any convenient dish, placing 
a plate with a weight on it, to press the meat. Cut it in 
slices, roll in flour, and fry in lard. 



MEATS. 4S 



69. Sausages, 

Chop, very fine, fat and lean fresh pork ; (there shoiud 
be a greater proportion of the lean,) season it very highly 
with pepper, salt, sage, and other sweet herbs if liked. A 
little saltpetre tends to preserve them. Do up a little into 
a cake, and fry it, to know when they are seasoned enough. 
When seasoned enough, fill your skins, which should he^ 
perfectly clean. To prevent the .fat running out while 
cooking, mix in with the meat a little flour. Done up in 
small balls and fried, sausage meat is good. 

When fresh pork cannot be had, very good sausage cakes 
may be made of raw beef, chopped fine with salt pork, and 
seasoned with sage and pepper. When fried they should 
not be pricked, as the sausages will cook nicer to have a 
little fat put with them in the frying pan. They should be 
cooked moderately. If not liked very fat, finish them on 
the gridiron, after the .sausages have been fried till nearly 
done. 

To make Bologna sausages, take equal weight ">( veal, 
pork, and ham, chopped very fine, seasoned high, and boifed 
till tender, in casings, and then dry them. 

70. Venison, 

Venison is said to be most easily digested of any sort of 
meat. It is good for those who have weak and slow diges- 
tive powers. It should be kept two weeks, if the weather 
permit, afler it is killed, and then roasted before a clear, 
s'JTong fire. 

71. To Roast Venison, 

Cover the fat parts with paper and a paste made of fiour 
and water to prevent their burning. Roast a haunch of 
twelve pounds about four hours. Baste it well. Serve it 
oat with current jelly. 

72. Venison Steaks. 

Broil or fry venison steaks in the same manner as veal 
cutlets, or mutton chops. 



40 FOWLS. 



73. Mock Venison, 

Mutton is the best substitute for real Tenison. Hang up, 
for several days, a large loin of fat mutton ; then bone it, 
and take off all the kidney fat, and the skin from the upper 
fat ; mix together two ounces of brown sugar, one ounce 
of pulverized black pepper, and two of allspice ; rub it well 
into the mutton ; keep the mutton covered with the skin, 
and rub and turn it daily five days. When to be roasted, 
cover it with the skin, and pepper it the same as for veni- 
son, first washing from it entirely the spices. Roast about 
the same tune as for real venison. Serve it with made 
gravy and currant jelly. 

74. Poultry. 

No sort' of animal food is so delicate and delicious as that 
of fowls and birds ; and none so generally healthful. Sel- 
dom does it disagree with those in health. The feeble in 
constitution, and such as are debilitated by sickness, find 
the flesh of fowl a nutritious and most agreeable diet. 

When well boiled, the white meat of a young turkey is 
easier of digestion than that of any other fowl. 

75. Turkey. 

Wash the turkey thoroughly, inside and out, having taken 
out the inwards. Take bread, drained and mashed fine, 
after soaked in cold water, for the dressing. Mix with the 
dressing a small piece of melted butter, or salt pork chopped 
fine. Season it with pepper and salt, sweet herbs if liked. 
It cuts smoother if an egg is added- Any kind of cooked 
meat is good, minced fine and mixed with the dressing. 
The inwards ought to be boiled very tender, if they arc to 
be used ; it is difficult to cook them through while the tur- 
key is roasting. The body and crop of the turkey must be 
filled with the dressing, and sewed up. Tie up the wings 
and legs, and rub on a little butter and salt. For roasting, 
twenty-five minutes to the pound is the rule. At first it 
should be roasted slowly, and basted frequently. When 
ihe fowl is put down to roast, a little water should be put 
into the dripping pan. Take the liquor the inwards are 



FOWLS 4T 

boiled in, for a gravy, adding a little of tHe turkej drippings. 
Place it where it will boil, thickening with a little flour and 
water, first mixed smooth. Season it with pepper, salt, 
and sweet herbs if liked. 

^ For boiling, the turkey is prepared in a similar way to 
the above. Parsley, lemon peel, and oysters may be added 
to the stuffing. Drawn butter is used when served out. 
If it is wished to have it look white, tie it up in a cloth, un- 
less you boil rice in the pot. Put in eight spoonfuls of rice, 
if rice is used. It is improved by the boiling of a pound 
or two of salt pork with it. If a soup is to be made of the 
liquor in which the turkey is boiled, let it stand till next 
day, and skim off the fat. Season it after heated. 

76. Chickens. 

These, whether for boiling or roasting, should have a 
dressing prepared as for turkies. Six spoonfuls of rice 
boiled with the chickens, will cause them to look white. 
If the water is cold when they are put in, they will be less 
liable to break. They are improved by boiling a little salt 
pork with them ; if not thus boiled they will need salt. 

For broiling, chickens should be split; the inwards taken 
out ; and then washed. Broil very slowly, till brown, plac- 
ing the bony side down on the gridiron ; then, turning it, 
brown the other side. Forty minutes is the medium time 
for broiling a chicken. 

For roast chicken, boil the gizzard and liver by thern-^ 
selves, and use the water for gravy. Put in the gravy the^ 
inwards chopped fine. 

77. Fricassee Chickens, 

The chickens should be washed, after jointing and taking 
out the inwards. With the skin side do^tTi, place them in 
a stew-pan, sprinkling pepper and salt on each layer ; add 
three or four slices of pork ; just cover with water, and stew 
them till tender. On taking them up, mix a little flour and 
water; thicken the liquor in which they were stewed; add 
a hen's egg size piece of butter ; replace the chickens in 
the stew pan, and let them stew about ^ve minutes longer. 
When the chickens are taken up, soak, in the gravy, two 
or three pieces of toast, and put them in your nU**^,r. plsM 



48 FOWLS. 

Jid chickens on the toast, and pour the gravy over them. 
If you want the chickens browned, stew them till tender 
without the pork, then brown the pork ; take that up ; then, 
putting in the chickens, fry them till of a light brown. 

78. To Fricassee Small Chickens, — Southern Mode. 

Cut off the wings and legs of four chickens ; separate 
the breasts from the backs ; divide the backs crosswise , 
cut off the necks ; clean the gizzards ; put them, with the 
livers, and other parts of the chicken, after being thoroughly 
washed, into a sauce pan ; add salt, pepper, and a little 
mace ; cover with water, and stew till tender. Take them 
up ; thicken half a pint of water with two spoonfuls of floux 
rubbed into four ounces of butter ; add a tumbler of new 
milk ; boil all together a few minutes, then add eight spoon- 
fuls of white wine, stirring it in carefully, so as not to cur- 
dle ; put in the chickens, and shake the pan till they are 
sufficiently heated, then serve them up. 

79. Chickens Baked in Rice. 

Joint a chicken, as for fricassee ; with pepper and salt 
season it well ; place it in a pudding dish lined with slices 
of bacon or of ham ; add an onion finely minced, and a pint 
of veal gravy ; pile up the dish full with boiled rice well 
pressed ; cover it with a paste of flour and water, and bake 
in a slow oven one hour. If veal gravy be wanting, sub- 
stitute water, with additional seasoning and ham. 

80. Goose. 

A goose should be dressed in the same manner, and 
oasted the same length of time as a turkey. Be particu- 
ar to select one that is tender. See marketing plates. 

If any fowls are injured but slightly, by too long keeping, 
tip them in weak salaeratus water before cooking, or rinse 
he inside with sharp vinegar. Strong camomile tea may 
DO used. 

81. To Stew Partridges. 

Truss a brace of partridges like fowls for boiling ; pound 
Ae livers with twice the quantity of fat bacon and bread 



FOWLS. 49 

crumbs boiled in milk ; i^d some mushroom^ aiid chopped 
parsley, mace, grated lemon peel, salt, and pepper ; stuff 
them ; tie them at each end, and place them in a stew pan 
lined with bacon. If you have it, add a quart of good gravy. 
If not, two onions, water, a few blades of mace, and a bonch 
of sweet herbs. Stew gently till they are tender ; take them 
out; strait, and thicken the sauce with flour and buttery 
heat, and pour it on the birds. 

82. Pigeons, 

Lay pigeons in a pot breast side down, the inwards being 
first taken out, and they prepared with a turkey-like dress- 
ing ^ pour in more than sufficient water to cover them ; put 
in four ounces of butter to every twelve pigeons, when 
stewed nearly tender, stirring into the gravy two or three 
teaspoonfuls of flour mixed with a little water. Put on a 
heated bake pan lid, if you wish to brown them, one hour 
before they are done ; or, soon as tender, fry them in pork 
fat. They are good, split open and stewed, with a dress* 
ing made and warmed up separately with a little of the 
gravy. If, tender, pigeons are good stufled and roasted. 
From two to three hours are requisite to cook pigeons. 
When put to the fire, roast pigeons should be buttered. 

83. To Stew Pigeons. 

Clean and wash six pigeons ; quarter them ; with them, 
put all their giblets into a stew pan, a little water, butter, 
salt, pepper, a bit of lemon peel, two blades of mace, and 
some chopped parsley ; stew till tender in a closely cov- 
ered pan. Thicken the gravy with the mixture of an egg 
beaten up ; three spoonfifls of cream, and a piece of butter 
dusted with flour. Stew them ten minutes longer. Ex- 
cellent. — Economical. 

84. Ducks. 

They are good roasted, or stewed like pigeons. The 
fishy taste wild ducks have, is entirely taken out by having 
an onion dressing. 



fiO RABBIT. 



85. ToBoUaDuck. 

Make a paste of half a pound of butter to a pound of 
flour ; truss the duck, putting into the inside a little salt and 
pepper, one or two sage leaves, and k little onion finely 
ttiinced ; inclose the duck in the paste, with a little jellied 
gravy. Boil it in a cloth, and serve it with brown gravy 
poured round it. 

86. To Stew Ducks. 

Cut one or two ducks into quarters ; fry them a light 
brown in butter ; put them into a sauce pan ; add a pint of 
gravy, four onions whole, pepper, salt, a bunch of parsley, 
two sage leaves, a sprig of winter savory, and sweet mar- 
joram ; cover the pan closely and stew them till tender. 
Take out the herbs and pepper ; skim it. If the sauce is 
not sufficiently thick, mix, with two spoonfuls of it, a little 
flour and stir it into the sauce pan ; let it boil up, and gar- 
nish the dish with four onions. 

Ducks and geese, if old, are better if parboiled before 
they are roasted. Put them on in just sufficient water to 
boil them ; keep the vessel closely covered. Let a tough 
goose simmer two hours ; then dry and wipe it thoroughly ; 
stuff and roast, basting at first with a little butter. 

87. To Roast Ducks, 

JPut into a pair of ducks, an onion chopped fine, and a 
few sage leaves, pepper, and salt ; spit, and dust them with 
flour, and baste them with lard. Roast half an hour, with 
a very hot fire. The quicker roasted, the better they will 
taste. Dust them with flour, and baste them, just before 
taking them from the spit. Prepare a gravy of the gizzards 
and pinions, a large mace blade, a few pepper-corns, a tea* 
spoonful of lemon pickle, and a spoonful of catsup ; strain, 
and turn it on the ducks. Send onion sauce in a boat. 

88. To Roast Rabbits. 

, After casing two rabbits, skewer their heads with theii 
mouths upon their backs ; stick their forelegs into their 



TURTLE. flj 

ribs ; skewer the hind legs doubled ; next, make a stuffing 
for them of the crumbs of half a loaf of bread, a little 
parsley, sweet marjoram, and thyme — all cut fine, pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg, to your taste ; mix them all into a light 
stuffing, with four ounces of butter, a little gopd cream, and 
two eggs ; put it into tfieir bodies, and sew them up ; dredge 
and baste them well with lard ; roast them about an hour. 
Serve them up with butter and parsley. Chop the livers, 
and lay them in lumps round the edge of the dish. 

89. To Dress Turtle 

Cut off the head in the morning, in summer ; at evening, 
in the winter ; hang it up by the hind fins, and let it bleed 
well ; with care, separate the bottom shell from the top, lest 
you break the gall bladder, which, with care, take out and 
throw away ; throw the liver into a bowl of water ; empty 
the chitterlings, (guts,) and throw them into water; the 
eggs also, if any — ^have a separate bowl for each article ; 
slice all the meat from the under shell, and throw that in 
water ; . break in pieces the shell ; wash clean and put it in 
a pot, completely covering it with water, and add to, it one 
pound of middling, (or flitch of bacon,) with four chopped 
onions, and set it on the fire to boil. Open the chitterlings ; 
clean them thoroughly ; take oflf the inside skin, and put 
them in the pot with the shell ; let them boil three hours 
steadily ; if the water boils away too much add more. 

The top ; — Wash the top shell neatly, after cutting out 
all the meat ; cover, and set it by. 

Parboil the fins ; clean them perfectly, taking oflf all the 
black skin, and throw them into water. Now cut the flesh 
t^eii from both shells, in small pieces ; cut the fins in two, 
and lay them in a dish with the flesh ; sprinkle over some 
salt, and cover up the dish. 

When the shell, chitterlings, &c. are done, or have 
boiled three hours, take out the bacon, scrape the shell clean, 
and strain the liquor — about one quart of which must be put 
back in the pot ; reserve the rest of the soup ; pick out the 
chitterlings,, and cut them in small pieces ; select all the 
nice bits that were strained out, and put them with the chit- 
terlings in the gravy ; add the fins, cut in pieces, to them, 



52 80UPS. 

and enough of the flesh to fill the upper shell ; add to it, if 
a large turtle, one hottle of white wine, cayenne pepper, 
and salt, to your taste ; one gill of mushroom catsup, one 
cill of lemon pickle, mace, cloves, and nutmeg, pounded, to 
highly season it ; mix two spoonfuls of flour with one pound 
and a quarter of hutter ; add, with it, marjoram, thyme, 
parsley, and savory, tied in a bunch ; stew all these to- 
gether till the flesh and fins are tender ; wash out the top 
shell ; place a high paste round the brim ; sprinkle over 
the shell salt and pepper, then take the herbs out of the 
stew ; if the gravy is not sufficiently thick, add a little more 
flour, and fill the shell. If no eggs in the turtle, boil six 
new laid ones for ten minutes ; put them in cold water a 
few minutes ; peel them ; cut ihcm in two, and place them 
on the turtle. Make a rich force meat ; fry the balls nicely, 
and place them also in the shell. Place the shell in a drip- 
ping pan, with something underneath the sides to steady it , 
heat the oven as for bread, and bake till a fine brown. Fry 
the liver, and send it hot. 

90. Turtle Soup. 

Put on, at an early hour in the morning, eight pounds of 
coarse beef, some bacon, onions, pepper, salt, and sweet 
herbs ; make a rich soup ; strain, and thicken it with butter 
and brown flour ; add to it the liquor left of the boiled bot- 
tom shell ; season it very high with wine, spice, cayenne, 
and catsup ; put in the reserved flesh ; if not enough, add 
the choicest parts of a well boiled calf's )iead — do not use 
the eyes or tongue ; let boil till tender, and serve it up widi 
force meat balls in it. 

Curry powder will give a higher flavor to both turtle and 
soup than spice. 

Should you not wish soup, the remaining flesh may be 
fried and served vnth a rich gravy. 

91. Mock Turtle of Calfs Head. 

Take a nicely cleaned head; separate the upper from the 
lower part ; take out the brains ; boil, till tender, the othei 
parts ; take them out of the water, and put into the watet 



SOUPS. 58 

sufficient to cover them, a knuckle of veal, or four pounds 

I of lean beef, three chopped onions, parsley, thyme, a tea- 

; spoonful of pounded cloves, a teaspoonful of mace, and of 

f salt, and cayenne pepper to the taste ; boil all together till 

I reduced to a pint of liquor ; strain it ; add two gills of red 

I wine, one of mushroom, and one of walnut catsup ; thicken 

it with brown flour and butter. Stew a few minutes, in the 

gravy, the head and tongue cut in small pieces. Put a 

paste round the edge of a deep dish, three folds, one on the 

other, but none on the bottom of the dish ; place the meat 

. and turn in the gravy, arid bake till the paste is done. 

Pick out all the strings from the brains ; pound them ; add 

salt, pepper, and grated bread, and make them into little 

cakes with- the yolk of an egg; fry them a nice brown. 

Boil hard six eggs ; leave one whole ; halve the five, and 

have some pieces of paste neatly baked. After the head 

is drawn from the oven, place the whole egg in the middle. 

and the pieces of paste, the brain cakes, and the other eggs, 

tastily around it. 

If it be intended as a soup, do not so much reduce the 
gravy ; but, after stewing the head, serve it in a tureen, 
with the brain cakes and some force meat balls fried, in- 
stead of the eggs. 

Instead of a knuckle of veal, or four poimds of beef, dif- 
ferent quantities may be taken, and such other variations 
made as may best please different'tastes. 



92. Plain Mock Turtle Soup, 

Boil a calf's head till very tender ; strain the liquor, on 
taking out the head ; let it stand till next day ; skim the 
fat off; cut the meat up, with the lights, and put both into 
the liquor ; place that over the fire, seasoning with pepper, 
salt, mace, and cloves, sweet herbs and onions if liked ; 
stew slowly thirty minutes ; add a tumbler of white wine 
just before taking up. Chop a little salt pork, with lean 
veal, fine, adding the brains, seasoned with pepper, salt, 
mace, cloves, sweet herbs or curry powder ; make all into 
bails of the size of the yolk of an egg ; boil part in the 
soup ; fry the others for a separate dish 



M SOUPS. 



93. Cdfs Feet Turtle Soup, 
Boil four calf's feet in two quarts of water, till very teii< 
. der ; take the meat from the bones ; strain the liquor ; add 
a pint of good beef gravy, and two glasses of wine ; season 
with hard eggs, balls,, <S^, as for the two last. 

94. Oyster Soup. 

Take the oysters out of the liquor ; to every quart of 
liquor add a pint of water or of milk ; then set it on the £bre 
with the oysters. Mix a large spoonful of flour with a little 
water, and stir it into the liquor as soon as it boils. Sea- 
son it with pepper, salt, and a little butternut or walnut 
vinegar, or common vinegar ; add a small piece of butter ; 
and, as soon as it boils up again, pour it on to buttered toast, 
cut in small pieces. 

95. Cream Soup, 

Take a nice knuckle of veal, or two or three shanks ; 
boil about four hours, with some pepper-corns, two onions, 
salt, a little mace, and a small bit of lean ham : strain it, 
and when cold remove all the fat and sediment ; beat six 
yolks of eggs and mix them with a pint of good cream ; 
then turn 3ie boiling soup upon it by degrees, stirring it 
well, and add the best part of the gristles to it if liked. 

Always boil cream before putting it in sauce or soup, 

96. Pea Soup. 

Put on a quart of peas in a gallon of water, with a ham 
bone, roast beef or mutton bones, four onions, and two heads 
of celery ; boil till sufficiently soft, then strain the pea pulp 
through a sieve ; return it into the pot, with salt and pep- 
per, and boil from forty to sixty minutes. A handful or two 
of spinach, washed and cut a little, added when the soup is 
strained, improves it much ; or, in place of the spinach, 
if a few young green peas can be gotten, the better. A 
teaspoonful of celery seed, or essence of celery may be 
substituted. 



80DPS 65 



97 . Ved Soup. 

Skin about four pounds of a knuckle of veal ; break and 
cut it into small pieces ; put it into a stew pan, with eight 
quarts of water ; skim it when it boils ; and reduce it to two 
quarts by simmering ; strain, and season it with salt, pep- 
per, a little mace, half a spoonful of lemon juice, and thicken 
with a spoonful of flour mixed with an ounce of butter, or a 
little rice. 

98. Black, or Beef Soup, 
For soup the shank of beef is the best joint. Cold beef 
steak, and cold roast beef bones, make good soup. Boil 
the shai)k, in sufficient water to cover it, about five hours. 
Thirty minutes before putting the soup on the table, take 
out the meat, thicken the broth with scorched flour mixed 
with cold water ; season it with pepper, salt, mace, and 
cloves ; a little walnut or tomato catsup improves it. Add 
sweet herbs, or herb spirit, if liked. Some boil onions in 
the soup ; but as they are offensive to many people, it is 
best to boil and serve them up by themselves. Make force 
meat balls of part of the beef and a little fat salt pork, chop- 
ped very fine, seasoned with salt, pepper, mace, and cloves, 
and boil them fifteen minutes in the soup. 

99. Bouilli Soup. 

Select about eight pounds of the choicest part of a thick 
brisket of beef ; lay it in a pot; sprinkle over it three-quar- 
ters of a spoonful of black pepper, two spoonfuls of salt, 
three onions chopped small, six small carrots scraped and 
cut up, and two small turnips pared and cut into dice ; turn 
on three quarts of water ; cover the pot close, and keep it 
steadily and moderately boiling five hours, or till the soup 
is reduced to three pints. Take off the scum carefully, as 
it rises, and do not let the pot boil over. When the pot has 
boiled four hours, put in a small bundle of parsley and 
thyme, and a pint of celery cut small, or a teaspoonful of 
pounded celery seed. If boiled too long, these latter ingre- 
dients will lose their delicate flavor. Just before taking up 
your soup, brown it in the following manner : put three* 



56 SOUP?. 

quarters of a spoonM of best brown sugar into an iron 
skillet, place it on the fire and stir it till it melts and looks 
very dark ; pour into it a ladle full of the soup, little at a 
time, stirring it all the while ; strain this browning and mir 
it well with the soup, first takihg out the meat, and the 
thyme and parsley. Cover up the soup and place it near 
the fire, that it may keep hot while you prepare the houiUu 

Take the skin'ofif the beef; dip a feather in the well- 
beaten yolk of an egg and wash the top of your beef; strew 
over it the finely grated crumbs of stale bread ; put it in a 
previously heated Dutch oven ; place the top on, with coals 
enough to brown, but not enough to bum the beef; let it 
stand nearly an hour, and prepare your gravy thus : — I'ake 
a sufficient quantity of soup and the vegetables boiled in it ; 
add to it a spoonful of red wine, and two of mushroom cat- 
sup ; thicken with a little .piece of butter, and a little brown 
flour ; make it very hot ; pour it in your dish, and place the 
beef on it. Garnish it with green pickles. Serve up the 
soup in a tureen, with bits of toasted bread. 

N. B. If you prefer this mode of making soup, to the 
one given for black soup, you have only to take the shin in 
place of the brisket, and make it like this till you coiue to 
the houilli; then, instead of following the remainder of this 
receipt, put the nicest pieces of the shin beef in your 
tureen, and pour on the soup and vegetables ; adding some 
toasted bread cut in dice : then serve it out. 



100. Portable Soup. 

Let veal or beef soup get quite cold, then skim oflf every 
particle of the fat ; boil it till of a thick glutinous consis- 
tence. Care should be taken not to have the soup bum. 
Season it very highly wiih pepper, salt, cloves, and mace ; 
add a little brandy or wine, and pour it over earthen plat- 
ters not more than a quarter of an inch in thickness. Let 
it be till cold, then cut it in three-inch square pieces, set 
them in the sun to dry, often turning them. When very 
dry, place them in a tin or earthen vessel, having a layer 
of white paper between each layer of cakes. These, if the 
directions are faithfully attended to, will keep good for a 
long time. Whenever you wish to make a soup of them,

you haye only to put a quart of water to one of the cakes, 
and to make the water piping. 



101. Soup Herb Spirit. 

Such as like a variety of herb spicery in soup, will find 
it convenient to have the following mixture: — When in 
tlieir prime, take sweet marjoram, sweet basil, thyme, and 
summer savory ; dry them thoroughly ; pound and sift them ; 
steop them two weeks in brandy. The spirit is then fit 
for use. 

102. Scotch Barley Broth. — A Cheap and Substantial Dtsh. 
Wash three-quarters of a pound of Scotch barley in cold 
water ; put it in a pot with about ten pounds of shin beef 
sawed into four pieces ; cover it well with cold water, and 
set it on the fire ; when it boils, skim it thoroughly, and put 
in two or three onions ; set it near the fire to simmer very 
gently about two hours ; then skim all the fat off, and put 
,in two heads of celery, and a good sized turnip cut into 
small squares ; season it with salt, and let it boil an hour 
and a half longer. Take out the meat carefully with a 
slice, and cover it up by the fire to keep warm ; skim the 
broth well and put it in the tureen. 

103. Gravies and Sauces. 

A great deal of the elegance of cookery depends upon 
the accompaniments to each dish being appropriate and well 
adapted to it. 

The French u«e a far greater variety of gravies and 
sauces than the Eiiglish or the Americans, who imitate the 
English manner of cooking. Nearly all kinds of meat give 
sufiicient gravy of their own ; and we should have the pe- 
culiar flavor of each, if we cooked to perfection. The 
French know this ; and their gravies are both better and . 
cheaper than ours. Thus, melted butter, which is now the 
principal gravy for meats, is unnecessarily wasted, to say 
nothing of its injurious effects. The skirts of beef, the kid 
noy, and the mUt, all make excellent gravies ; the shankv 
of mutton too ; and prepared the same as the following : 
6 



69 GRAYIES AND SAUCES. 



104. Brawn Gravy 

Slice fo\ir pounds of lean beef; rub the bottom of the pot 
with butter, and put in the meat ; turn it often till well 
browned, and do it moderately ; then add four quarts of cold 
water. After boiling two hours, put in a spoonful of pep- 

Eer-coms, one carrot, and three onions ; stew gently four 
ours longer ; strain it ; and when required for use, skim 
off the fat. 

105. To Draw, ar Melt Butter. 

Nothing is more simple in the doing, yet nothing done so 
badly. Keep a quart tin sauce pan, with a cover to it, ex- 
clusively for this use. Take four ounces of good butter ; 
rub into it two teaspoonfuls of flour ; put it in the sauce 
pan, with one spoonful of water and a little salt ; cover it, 
and set the sauce pan in a larger one of boiling water ; 
shake it continually until entirely melted and beginning to 
boil. If the pan containing the butter be placed on coals, 
the heat will reduce the butter to oil, and so spoil the but- 
ter. This quantity is enough for one sauceboat. 

A great variety of savory sauces may be made by adding 
different herbs to drawn butter, all of which are fine to eat 
with boiled butcher's meat, fish, or fowl. 

Take parsley ; wash a large bunch very clean; pick the 
leaves from the stems carefully ; boil them ten minutes in 
salt and water ; drain them perfectly dry ; mince them ex- 
ceedingly fine^ and stir them in the butter when it begins to 
draw. 

When herbs are to be added to the butter, you must take 
two spoonfuls of water instead of one for the preparation. 

Chervil, burnet, tarragon, young fennel, and cress or 
peppergrass, may all be used ; and they must be prepared 
in the same mode as the parsley. 



106. Burnt Butter, for Fish, Eggs, or Salad. 

Put two ounces of butter into a frying pan ; set on the 
fire ; when of a dark brown color, put in six spoonfuls of 
vinegar, a little pepper, and salt. 



ORAYIBS AND SAXTCfiS. 69 

107. Dravon Butter^ Curry Sauce^ and Egg Sauce. 

Always use sweet butter ; if at all hurt, the butter is more 
than lost : it spoils the gravy, and every thing it is intended 
to season. 

Mix two or three teaspoonfuls of floiur with a little cold 
water ; stir it till clear of lumps ; thin it, and pour on half a 
pint of boiling water, stirring it constantly ; boil it two or 
three minutes ; then cut up four ounces of butter into bits ; 
add it to the flour and water, and place it where it will 
melt. It will be free of lumps if properly mixed. Strain 
it before it is carried to the table, if not so. 

If the butter is wanted for fish, cut into it several soil 
boiled eggs. 

If you want curry sauce, sprinkle in curry powder. 

108. Roast Meat Gravy, and Dark Gravy, 

Put a pint of water into your dripping pan, when you put 
down your meat to roast ; just before the meat is done, stir 
up the drippings ; pour ^em into a skillet, and put them 
where they will boil. Smoothly mix two or three tea- 
spoonfuls of flour with a little water, and stir them into the 
gravy when it boils. 

The gravy for veal and lamb, requires a little butter ; for 
pork and geese, a little of the dressing and sage mixed 
with it 

If you wish your gravy to look dark, scorch the flour 
you thicken wiUi : — ^put it in a pan, place it on a few coals ; 
stir it continually, tiU a dark brown. Do not bum it. 
Sufficient may be browned at once for long use. 

109. Sauce for Cold Meat, Salad, or Fish. 

Boil two eggs three minutes ; mix with them a mustard- 
spoonful of prepared mustard, a little pepper, salt, six spoon- 
fuls of drawn butter, or salad oil, six of vinegar, and one of 
catsup. 

110. Wine Sauce for Venison or Mutton. 

Warm two gills of the liquor the meat was boiled in, or 
of the drippings ; mix two teaspoonfuls of scorched flour 



60 OEAVISS AND 8AVCBS.' 

with a little water, and stir it in when the gravy boils ; sea* 
80Q it with cloves, salt, and pepper ; stir in a spoonM of 
warm jelly ; and, just before taking from the fire, a gill of 
wine. For venison or mutton sauce, many prefer molted 
currant jelly. 

111. Oyster Sauce. 
To a pint of oyster liquor, put a little salt and pepper, 
and two blades of mace, (some add lemon juice ;) place it 
on the fire; on boiling, stir in two teaspoonfuls of flour 
mixed with a little milk ; after boiling a few minutes, stir 
in half a pint of oysters, and a hen's egg size piece of but- 
ter ; as soon as scalded through, take them up. 

112. Savoy Jelly for Cold Meat. 

Boil lean veal, or beef, till tender. If you have veal or 
beef bones, break and boil them with it — ^they will require 
longer boiling. Boil, too, a little salt pork, sweet herbs, 
salt, and pepper. When sufficiently boiled, take it off; 
strain, and let it stand till next day ; skim off the fat ; take 
out the jelly ; and scrape off the dregs that stick to the bot- 
tom ; put in the whites and shells of several eggs, some 
blades of mace, a little wine, and lemon juice ; place all on 
the fire ; stir it well till it boils ; strain it through a jelly- 
bag till it is clear. 

113. White Celery Sauce for Boiled Poultry'. 
Take six heads of celery ; cut off the green tops ; slice 
the remainder into small bits, and boil in half a pint of wa- 
ter, till tender ; mix three teaspoonfuls of flour, smoothly, 
with a little milk ; add six spoonfuls F«i>re of milk ; stir it 
in ; add a little salt, and a small piece of butter ; on boiling 
take it up. Some use as a substitute for part, an egg yolk, 
with a spoonful of cream, and chopped parsley and lemon 
juice. 

114. Caper Sauce. 
Is made by adding a spoonful or two of capers to drawn 
butter — many add, too, a little of the liquor. Nasturtiona 
pickled, or green ]/ickles, minced and put with the butter, 
make a very good substitute for capers. 



GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 61 



115. Lobster Sauce. 

Boil two eggs three minutes ; mix with them a teaspoon 
^ fill of water and the spawn of the lobster ; rub smooth and 
stir in a teaspoonful of mustard, six spoonfuls of drawn 
butter or salad oil, a litde pepper and salt, and five spoon- 
fuls of vinegar. Or, boil a little mace and whole pepper 
long enough to extract their strength ; strain, and melt in it 
three-quarters of a pound of butter. Cut the lobster in very 
small pieces, and stew in it till tender. 

116. Tomato Sauce. 

Peel and slice twelve tomatoes ; pick out the seeds ; add 
three pounded crackers, salt, and pepper; stew about 
twenty minutes. 

117. Gravy Sauce. 

Beef of good quality, and roasted with care, affords the 
best sauce for the meat. . Free it of the sediment and fat ; 
add a little salt, and, if not thick enough, a mite of browned 
flour, and boil it up. A little butter may be added to the 
veal gravy. 

118. Common Sauce. 

Plain butter, drawn or melted thick, with a spoonful of 
walnut pickle, or catsup, makes a very good sauce. But 
you may multiply additions according to variety of tastes. 

119. Parsley and Butter. 

Is made by adding parsley that has been chopped fine, 
after boiling a few minutes, to drawn butter. 

120. Pudding Sauce. 

Stir to a cream a teacup of butter, with two of brown 
sugar ; add a glass of wine or cider ; flavor it with rose- 
water, essence of lemon, or nutmeg. If you would have it 
liquid, heat about three gills of water boiling hot ; mix three 
teaspoonfuls of flour with a little water, and stir it into the 
boiling water ; stir this into the butter and sugar, as soon 
as itl^ils up well. *

121. Cranberry and Apple Sauce. 

To stew cranberries till soft, is all that is recessary to 
make cranberry sauce. When soft, stir in sugar and mo- 
lasses to sweeten it. Scald the sugar in the sauce a few 
minutes. Strain if you please — 'tis good without. 

Apples should be pared and quartered. If tart, you may 
stew them in water ; if not, in cider. After stewed soft, 
add a small jHece of butter, and sweeten to the taste. 

Another very good way is, to boil the apples without 
paring, with a few quinces and molasses, in new cider, till 
reduced one half. Strain the sauce when cool. Made 
tluis, the sauce will keep good for months. 

122. Chicken Salad. 

Boil a chicken -that does not exceed in weight a pound 
and a half. When quite tender, take it up', cut it in small 
strips, and prepare the following sauce and pour on it : — 
Boil four egg^ three minutes ; take them out of the shells ; 
mash, and mix them with two spoonfuls of drawn butter, 
twelve of vinegar, a teaspoonful of mixed mustard, the same 
of salt, a little pepper, and essence of celery. 

123.' Sauce for Turtle or Calf's Head. 

To four gills of hot drawn butter, or beef gravy, put a 
little sage, basil, or sweet marjoram, the juice and grated 
rind of half a lemon, a little cayenne or black pepper, and 
salt ; add a glass of white wine just before you take it up. 

124. Mushroom Catsup. 

Lay fresh mushrooms in a deep dish ; strew a little salt 
over them ; then add another layer of fresh mushrooms, and 
salt : and so on till you get in all the mushrooms. Let them 
lay some days ; mash them fine ; and to each quart put a 
spoonful of vinegar, half a teaspoonful of pepper, and quar- 
ter of a teaspoonful of cloves. Pour it into a stone jar ; set 
the jar into a pot of boiling water ; let it boil two hours \ 
then strain it without pressing the mushrooms. Boil the 
*uice fifteen minutes ; skim well ; let it stand a fuw hours to 



GRAVIES AND SAUCES 63 

settle ; then paur it off carefully through a sieve ,"^ bottle, and 
cork it close. Place it where cool. > 

125. Celery Vinegar. 

Take two gills of celery seed ; pound and put it in a hot- 
tie, and fill it with sharp vinegar ; shake it every day, for 
two weeks ; then strain it, and keep it for use. It vnll im- 
part an agreeable celery flavor to every thing with which 
it is used. 

A delicious flavor of thjrme may be obtained, if gathered 
when in full perfection. It should be picked from the 
stalks, a large handful of it put into a jar, and a quart of 
vinegar or brandy turned on it; cover it very close. Next 
day, take all the thyme out, and put in as much more. Do 
this a third time; then strain, bottle, and seal the cork. 
This is far preferable to dried thyme. Mint may be pre- 
pared in a similar manner. The flavor of both these kinds 
of herbs must be preserved by care in the preparation. If 
permitted to remain more than twenty hours in the liquid, 
they will impart an unsavory taste. 

126. Sauce for Cod's Head. 

Take a lobster ; stick a skewer in the vent of the tail, to 
keep the water out ; throw a handful of salt into the water ; 
when it boils, put in the lobster, and boil it half an hour ; 
pick off the spawns, if any, and pound them very fine, in a 
marble mortar, and put them into half a pound of drawn 
butter ; take the meat out of the lobster, pull it in bits, and 
put it in your butter ; add a spoonful of lemon pickle, a 
spoonful of walnut catsup, a slice of lemon, a slice or two 
of horse radish, a little pounded mace, and salt and cay« 
enne to your taste ; boil them one minute ; then take out the 
lemon and horse radish, and serve it up in your sauceboat 

127. Fish Sauce of Liver. 

Boil the liver of the fish ; mash it fine ; stir it into drawr 
butter ; put in a little black pepper, or cayenne, two tea 
spoonfuls of lemon juice and a spoonful of catsup. 



64 BG08. 

128. Gravy for Ducks. 
Boil all the giblets but the liver, one hour, in a pint ol 
water, with a chopped onion, some salt, and pepper ; strain, 
and add a very litUe browning, and a teaspoonful or two 
of mushroom catsup. 

129. Duck Sauce, 

Boil eight or ten large onions ; change the water two or 
three times while they are boiling ; when done, chop them 
on a board, to have them retain a good color ; put them in 
a sauce pan with four ounces of butter and two spoonfuls 
of good cream ; boil it a little, and turn it over the ducks. 

130. Brown Sauce for Poultry. 

Slibe two or three onions, after they are peeled ; sprinkle 
them with flour, and fry them brown, in a little butter ; 
sprinkle in a little flour, salt, peppes, and sage ; add half a 
pint of the liquor the fowl was boiled in, and a spoonful oj 
catsup ; if liked, when it boils up, stir in half a wineglass 
of wine. " » 

131. Boiled Eggs. 

Put eggs into boiling water ; if you like the white just 
set, boil about two minutes ; if you like the yolk set, boil 
three ; if for a salad, boil ten minutes. Boil a new-laid egg 
half a minute longer than a stale one. Another mode, 
which is very nice for fish, is to break the shells, and drop 
the eggs into a pan of scalding water ; let the pan stand till 
the white has set ; then place it on a moderate fire ; when 
the water boils up the eggs are done. Eggs look very 
pretty done in this way, the yolk being just visible through 
the white. Serve them up with burnt butter, if not wanted 
for a garnish. 

132. Poached Eggs. 

Break the eggs into a pan, (it is a good precaution, in 
case of a bad egg, to break each separately into a teacup;) 
then put them into a buttered tin pan ; place the pan on a 
few coals ; put in a small piece of butter, and a little salt; 



nsR. 6S 

let them cook very moderatnly, stirring them contmualff 
till they become quite thick, then turn them on to spread 
toast. 

133. Omelei, 
To twelve eggs, beaten to a froth, put three ounces of 
finely minced boiled ham, beef, or veal ; (if veal, add a little 
salt ;) melt four ounces of butter to a lukewarm temperature, 
and mix a little of it with the eggs ;. put the remamdcr of 
the butter on the fire in a frying pan, or tin ; when quite hot, 
turn in the beaten eggs, and stir till they begin to set. When 
brown on the under side it is sufficiently done. It should 
be cooked on a moderate fire, and in a pan so small as to 
have the omelet about an inch thick. When you take up 
the omelet, place a flat dish over the top, and turn your pan 
upside down. 

134. Egg Balls. 

Boil four eggs ten minutes ; when they are quite cold, 
put the yolks into a mortar, with the yolk of a raw egg, a 
teaspoonful of flour, some chopped parsley, a little salt, a 
little black pepper or cayenne ; rub them well together, and 
roH them into small balls, and boil them two minutes. 

135. Fish. 

'' Fish is a dish which is almost more atterided to than 
any other," — attention from the time of its being caught to 
the time of serving out. It is easier of digestion than meats, 
with the exception of salmon. 

Small trout are the most delicate for invalids. Lake fish 
are also excellent. All kinds of fresh water fish are health- 
ful, if cooked immediately afler being taken. But the ocean 
is the chief dependence of our fish markets. It would be 
better for the health of those who do not labor, if they would 
use more fish, and less flesh, for food. With the exception 
of salmon and lobsters, there is little danger, in our country, 
of this kind of aliment being eaten to excess. 

Flesh is much more nutritious than fish. As restorative 
food, shell-fish have long held a distinguished rank ; but 
beef, or a well dressed chop, is much better to recruit the 
strength and spirits. 

The wise and benevolent arrangements of Providenca 



66 FISH. 

seem to have designed that the products -of different cli- 
mates should be most freely used, where most liberaUy 
pro\ided. 

The climate of the Greenlander requires oil and the fat- 
test substances, to sustain the human constitution ; no con- 
diment, nor scarcely a vegetable is required. In warm cli- 
mates, pepper and other spices are produced, and, no doubt, 
required, where the diet is chiefly vegetable, or meats newly- 
killed ; and the stomach and system are relaxed by the heat. 
In our own climate, the season of the year, as well as the 
age and constitution of the individual, must be taken into 
the accoimt. During the cold weather, more fat meats, and 
richer gravies, may be eaten, but few or no condiments, 
except a little salt, are needed. In summer, fish, and a 
large proportion of vegetable diet, should be used. Sauces 
made with cream and eggs, may be used ; and, if not too 
freely, doubtless, condiments will also be advantageous. 

Sometimes there is a muddy smell and taste attached to 
fresh water fish, which may be remedied by soaking them, 
afler they have been thoroughly cleaned, in strong salt and 
water. Care should be taken that the fish be thoroughly 
cleaned before dressed ; but not washed beyond what is 
necessary for the cleaning — by too much watering the fla- 
ror is diminished. Great care and punctuality are also 
accessary in cooking fish. They should be eaten as soon 
48 done. If not sufficiently done, or if too much done, they 
ire not good. They are the best the day after they are 
caught, except turbot, cod, &c., for boiling or frying. They 
should be cleansed when first caught, well rinsed in cold 
water, and salt freely sprinkled over their inside. Sprinkle 
pepper, if they are to be broiled, and place them where 
cool. When dished, the liver, roe, and chitterlings, should 
be placed so that the carver may observe them, .and invite 
the guests to partake of them. 

136. To Boil Fish, 

To boil fresh fish, lay it on a strainer, or sew up the fish 
in a cloth, as it will otherwise be difficult to take it out of 
the pot without breaking. Put the fish in cold water, with 
♦he skin side downr.; if put into boiling ^vate^, the outside 
gets cooked too much, and breaks to pieces before the in- 



FISH. 67 

side is done. To ten pounds of fish add six spoonfuls of 
salt ; and a little vinegar should be put into the water to . 
impart firmness. Boil the fish tilJ you can easily draw out 
one of the fins — ^from fifteen to thirty minutes. Boiled fi^h 
should be served up with drawn butter or livei sauce. 

137. To Broil Fish. 

When fish is broiled, the bars of the gridiron should be 
rubbed over with a little butter. Then place your fish, skin 
side down— down, no mistake, and do not turn it till nearly 
done through. Save all your butter till the fish is dished — 
in this way you save the juices of the fish too. Fish should 
be broiled slowly. When put on the platter, fish should 
not be laid over each other, if it can be avoided. The top 
ones will be made tender and moist by the steam, and will 
break to pieces. 

138. To Fry Fish. 

Fat from salt pork is best; there should be enough to 
cover the fish, and hot and skimmed when the fish are laid 
in. After being cleaned and washed, fish for frying should 
be put into a cloth, to have it absorb the moisture ; make it 
quite dry, and rub a little flour over it, but no salt, if you 
wish to have it brown well. For six pounds of fish, fry 
four slices of salt pork ; when brown, take them up, and if 
they do not make enough fat to fry the fish in, put in a little 
lard. When fried enough, take them up; and for good 
plain gravy, mix two or ibree teaspoonfuls of flour with a 
little water, and stir into the fat the fish was fried in ; put 
in a little butter, salt, and pepper; if you wish to have the 
gravy rich, add wine, catsup, and spices. Turn the gravy 
over the fish. 

139. To Fry Fresh Cod, Trout, and Perch. 

Prepare the fish according to receipt 138 ; slice the cod 
into pieces half or three-quarters" of an inch thick; rub them 
in Indian meal, to prevent breaking ; fry thoroughly. 

Perch and trout are fried in the same way, except, in 
stead of rubbing in Indian meal, sprinkle with flour, or dip 
in the white of an egg and bread crumbs. 



68 Pi8U. 

140. To BroU a Shad. 

Clean, wash, and split the shad, and wipe it dry ; spriH' 
kle it with pepper and salt, place it over a very clear, slow 
fire, with the skin side down, so as to retain the juices, on 
a clean gridiron rubbed with lard ; turn it, when nearly 
done ; take up, and season with a generous piece of butter, 
salt and pepper. A smoke of com cobs while it is broiling, 
improves it much ^ 

141. To Roast a~Shad. 

Fill the inside with good force meat ; sew it up ; tie it 
on a suitable board, (not pine ;) cover it with bread crumbs, 
a little salt, and pepper, and place it before the fire ; when 
done one side, turn it ; and when sufficiently done, pull out 
the thread ; dish it ; and serve it out with drawn butter and 
parsley. 

143. To Bake a Shad, 

Nicely prepare a large fat fish ; put some force meat in the 
inside ; lay it full length in a pan, with a pint of water, a 
gill of red wine, one of mushroom catsup, a little salt, pep- 
per, vinegar, six cloves, and a few cloves of garlic ; stew 
gently, till the gravy is sufficiently reduced. Always lay 
the fish on a fish slice, for the convenience of dishing with- 
out breaking it. When taken up, slide it carefully into the 
dish ; thicken the gravy with butter and brown flour, and 
turn over it. 

143. To Stuff and Bake Fish 

Soak your bread in cold water till soft, drain it, mash 
fine and mix the bread with a spoonful of drawn butter, a , 
little salt, and pepper, (two raw eggs make the dressing cafc 
smoother,) and some spices, if liked. Fill, and sew up the 
fish ; pui a teacup of water in your bake pan, and a little 
butter, place in the fish, and bake about forty or fifty min- . 
utes. Bass, shad, and fresh cod, are good fish for baking. 

144. Chowder. 

Fry brown several slices of pork, cut each fish into firt 
or six pieces ; flour, and place a layer of them in your pork 



FISH. 69^ 

fat ; sprinkle on a little pepper and salt ; add cloveSy maeen 
and sliced onions ; if liked, lay on bits of the fried park» 
and crackers soaked in cold water. JRepeat this till you put 
in all the fish ; turn on water just sufficient to cover them, 
and put on a heated bake pan lid. After stewing about 
twenty minutes, take up the fish, and mix two teaspoonfuls 
of flour with a little water, and stir it into the gravy ; add* 
ing a little pepper and butter. A tumbler of wine, catsup, 
and spices will improve it. Cod and bass make the best 
chowder. Clams and 'black fish tolerably good. The hard 
part of the clam should be cut off and rejected. 

145. Codjis^. 

Fresh cod is good to broil, fry, or to make into a chow- 
der. It is rather dry for broiling. Salt cod should be 
soaked all night in water, with a glass of vinegar. It will 
make it like fresh fish. In the morning take it out ; put it 
in fresh water ; and place it three or four hours on a mode- 
rate fire, where it will keep warm without boiling — boiling 
hardens it; take it up, ana take off the skin; serve it out 
with drawn butter. 

146. To Boil a Cod's Head and Shoulders, 

Wash it clean ; tie it up, and dry it with a cloth ; salt 
your water well and put in a glass of vinegar ; wh^i it 
boils, take ofi* the scum ; put in the fish, and keep it boiUng 
very briskly about thirty minutes. Parboil the milt, and 
roe ; cut in thin sHces, fry, and serve them. Garnish with 
horse radish. For sauces — oysters, eggs, or drawn butter^ 

147. To Roast Cod's Head and Shoulders. 
Prepare it as for boiling, taking out the gills and rubbing 

over it a little salt ; then, boiling all but enough for eating, 
take it up very carefully ; take off the skin ; set it before a 
brisk fire ; dredge it all over with flour, and baste it well 
with butter; when it begins to froth, strew over it some fine 
bread crumbs ; continue basting all the time to make it froth 
well. *'When of a fine light b/own, dish it up, and garnish 
it with a lemon cut in slices, barberries, horse radish, fried 
Qys^ers, or a few small fish fried and laid around it. Cot

150. To Broa Herring. 

When they are to be used, take a few out of the brine , 
soak them an hour or two ; scale them nicely : pull off the 
gills, and the only entrail ^ey have will come with them ; 
wash them clean, and hang them up to dry. When to be 
broiled, take half a sheet of white paper ; rub it over with 
butter ; put the herring in ; double the edges securely ; and 
broil without burning. 

151. Sturgeon, 

This fish is best fried, but good baked or broiled. Before 
baking it, boil fifteen minutes to extract the oily taste, put 
a quart of water intd the pan for ten pounds of fish, and 
bake till it is'tender. The part next to the tail is best for 
frying or baking 

Sturgeon is good cooked thus : cut it in slices about an 
inch thick, fry some slices of pork, when brown, take them 
up, and put in the sturgeon. When well browned, take up 
and stir in a little fiour and water, mixed smoothly together. 
Season the gravy with pepper, salt, and catsup, stir in a 
little butter, and wine if liked, then put back the sturgeon, 
and let it stew a few minutes in the gravy. While the fish 
is cooking, make force meat balls of part of the sturgeon 
and salt pork ; fry and use them for a garnish. 

152. To Boil Fresh Salmon. 

This fish needs more boiling in more water than any other 
fish. It is very unhealthy unless thoroughly done. 

Make your water quite salt, boily skim^ then put in your 



Fisa VI 

Balmon; Continiie to skim off all t]iat rises. Boil half m 
pound fifteen minutes ; lobster, egg, or drawn butter for 
sauce. 

153. To Broil Fresh Salman 

Slice it an inch and a half thick, dry in a clean cloth, 
and sprinkle a little salt over it ; warm the bars of your grid- 
iron, and rub them with a little lard ; lay the fish on, and 
set your gridiron over a clear but not very hot fire ; when 
nearly done, turn carefully, and do the other side. 

154. To Boil Mackerel, Trout, Perch, and Bass. 

If fresh, after cleaning it thoroughly, put into sufiicienl 
water to cover it, sprinkling in a little salt, (some add a 
glass of vinegar) and let it rather simmer than hoil,JifteeH 
or more minutes. When done, take instantly from the 
water. 

Bass, Perch and Trout are boiled in the same maimer. 
Use drawn butter for boiled fish. 

155. To Broil Mackerel, Perch, Bass, or Trout. 

The same as " To Broil Shad," — No. 140. Fine shred 
parsley may likewise be added to seasoning of both, if liked; 
'* dr<twn butter^'* is a good sauce for fish. 

156. To Boil Eels. 

Clean, cut off the heads, and dry them ; joint them into 
suitable length pieces, or coil them on your fish plate, boil 
them in salted water ; use drawn butter and paisley for 
sauce. 

157. To Broil Eels. 

After preparing them as for boiling, rub them with the 
yolk of an egg, strew over bread crumbs, minced parsley, 
pepper, salt, and sage ; butter them well, and lay them in a 
dripping pan to broil. Sauce as for boiled eels, or to did 
taste. 



7i FISH. 



158. To Bake Eels. 

Joint and lay them in a deep dish, with bits of salt povk 
peppered and salted ; cover with pounded rusked bread, 
mod bake thirty minutes. 

159. Fish Farce Meat B<dls. 

Chop fine a little raw fish with a little raw salt pork, mix 
it with an egg or two raw, a few bread erumbs, and season 
with pepper and spices, catsup, and to the taste : mould into 
small balls and fry them till nicely browned. 

160. Fish Cakes. 
Take salt cod fish, or cold fresh fish boiled, mince it fine 
with potatoes, moistened with a little milk, and a bit of but- 
ter in it, mould into biscuit sized cakes, and fry them brown 
in butter, or pork fat. 

161. Lobsters and Crabs. 

Have your water boil, put in and boil them from thirty to 
forty five minutes. Boil six spoonfuls of salt to eveiy four 
pounds of fish. When cold, break the shell, take out the 
meat, be cautious to extract the blue veins, and what is called 
the lady in the lobster ; these are veiy unhealthy. 

Eat cold with a dressing of vinegar, mustard, sweet oil, 
salt and cayenne $ or warm them up with a little water, vine* 
gar, salt, pepper ; and add a rich gravy and grated nutmeg, 
ifliJLed. 

Lobsters look neatly dressed thus. Select the spawn 
and red chord, mash fine and rub them through a sieve, 
add a little butter and salt. Cut the lobsters into squares, 
and set them with the spawn, over a moderate fire ; when 
hot, take up and garnish with parsley. The spawn and 
chord are a nice garnish for ^ny kind of fish ; eat but little 
of the lobster. 

The same process for Crabs as for Lobsters. 

162. Scollops. 

These are fine boiled, then fried; or pickled in the 
«ame way as oysters. Take them from the shells. Aftei 
boiling pick out the hearts and throw the rest away Tho 



- FISH. 19 

heart is the only part that is healthful. Flour and try Aft 
hearts tiU brown, in butter. They are good stewed, in » 
little pepper, salt and butter. 

163. To Roast Clams, — Superior mode of cooking them. 

Select according to taste as to size, f those with thin edges 
are the tenderest, never buy those ot a thick edge,) wash 
them clean, place them flatwise in an old tin or iron pan, so 
as to save the liquor, and set the pan over a furnace of igni- 
ted coal. As they become sufficiently roasted, take them 
.out singly, empty the liquor of each into your dish, then 
take out and add the clam, either cut in pieces or whole ; 
add butter, salt, and pepper; other seasoning to taste. 
Clams and oysters generally agree with those who like 
them* Lobsters may form an exception. 



164. Pot Clams. 

Wash and put the clams in a pot, with merely water 
enough, to prevent their burning. ^Heat till they open, take 
ont and warm them with a little of the liquor, butter, salt 
and pepper. To a slice or two of toasted bread, soaked in 
the clam liquor, add the clams. 

165. Clam Pancakes. 

Make a thick batter of flour and milk ; clam liquor does 
not make them so light as milk^ put to each pint of milk 
two eggs and a few clams ; the clams may be put in wholp 
after being flrst stewed, or they may be only taken out of 
the shell and chopped flne. 

166. Long Clams. 

Select the largest, take them out of the shell, and broil 
them ; or they may be stewed ; season to the liking. 

167. To Stew Oysters. 
Rinse the bits of shell oflfthe oysters, strain, then tarn 

die liquor back, put them in a stew pan over the Are, let 

7# 



74 PUDDINGS. - 

them boil up, then turn them on to buttered toast ; butter, 
pepper and salt them. Some thicken the liquor with rolled 
cracker, and put in milk and cream ; others add a little 
walnut catsup, or vinegar, mace, or lemon peel. Oysters 
should be eaten hoU 

168. To Fry Oysters. 

Select the fattest of large size, dip them in beaten eggs, 
then in flour, or fine bread crumbs ; fry them in lard tiU of 
a light brown. They are a fine garnish for calves' head, 
fishy or most modem dishes. 

169, Oyster Pancakes. 

Mix together equal measures of oyster liquor and milk, 
to a pint of this mixture, put a pint of wheat flour, a few 
oysters, two eggs, and a little salt ; drop by spoonfuls into 
hot lard, and fry till of a nic^e brown. 

170. Oyster Pie, 

Line a deep dish with pie-crust, fill with diy pieces of 
bread, and cover it with pufl* paste, bake either in a bake 
pan or quick oven till it is a light brown ; by this time have 
the oysters just stewed, take off the upper crust, take out the 
pieces of bread, put in the oysters, season with salt, pepper, 
and butter ; walnut catsup : replace the upper crust. 

171. Scolloped Oysters. 

• Pound fine, rusked bread or crackers, butter scollop 
shells or tins, sprinkle on the bread stuff, put in a layer of 
oysters, a bit of butter, salt, pepper, and a little of the oyster 
liquor ; add another layer of crumbs, and oysters, and so on 
till the shells are filled, placing a layer of the bread stuff 
on the top, bake them till of a light brown in a Dutch oven. 

172. Puddings. 

Be particular to always wash the salt from butter, whore 
•ugar constitutes one ingredient of any compound ; or wh«re 
drawn butter is to be used to butter any mould for bakinf - 



PUDDINOS. 75 

if not, the article baked will have an unsavory salt taste on 
its outside. 

Stone_ and cut in two your raisins ; sift a little flour over 
them, stir them in the flour and take them out free from 
lumps — ^the flour which adheres to them will prevent their 
uniting, or settling to the bottom in a mass. Or when you 
bake puddings, by waiting till the pudding begins to thicken 
in the oven, before you add the Truit, the fruit will not sink. 

Use fresh eggs — stale eggs will not beat well. Always 
separate the yolks from the whites ; when they are to be 
mixed with milk, let the milk cool after boiling, or the eggs 
will poach ; and set the milk on the fire only a few minutes, 
to take out the raw taste of the egg, stirring it continually 

Wash your currants in several waters, till perfectly clean. 
Pick over and dry them well ; or they will adhere. 

Put your almonds in hot water, till you can blanch, or 
skin them ; always pound them with orange or rose water, 
to prevent their oiling. 

Put in cream, if used, just before the mixture is ready — 
much beating will decompose it. 

Before a pudding or cake is begun, (for the above direc- 
tions will apply as well to cake as to puddings) have every 
ingredient ready. The article is injured when the process 
is retarded by neglect in the preparations. Have the oven 
in a proper state ; and the paste ready in the dishes or 
moulds for such things as require a paste. When but a 
single egg, or two, are to be used, cooks often think it use- 
less to beat them : mistake ! unless they are made light be- 
fore used, eggs are an injury. It is well to mix the pudding 
an hour or two before it is boiled or baked. ^ 

Make your pudding bags of German sheeting : a cloth 
less thick will admit water, and deteriorate the pudding. 
Before turning in, or bagging your pudding, dip the cloth in 
water, wring it out, and flour the inside. When bagged^ tie 
tight, leaving sufficient room for expansion by swelling. 
Flour and Indian puddings require much room. Put them 
in a pot of boiling water, placing an old plate on the bottom, 
to prevent the bag from sticking to it. Turn the bag over, 
after having been in the pot a few minutes, to prevent the 
pudding's settling and becoming heavy. Keep sufficient 
water in tho pot to cover the pudding, and not let the pot 



76 PUDDINGS. 

Stop l>oiling one secpnd — if so, the pudding will not be thm 
t/ung, A tea-kettle of boiling water should be at hand to 
turn in as the water boils away. When the puddings is 
done, dip the bag in cold water a moment; the pudding -will 
then readily turn out. 

173-. Virginia Chicken Pudding. 

Beat ten eggs perfectly light, add to them a quart of ricli 
milk, four ounces of drawn butter, pepper, and salt ; £«ir in 
sufficient flour to make a thin batter ; then take four young 
chickens, clean them neatly, cut^ off the legs, wings &c. 
Put them all in a sauce pan, with salt and water, and a bun-, 
die of thyme and parsley ; boil them till nearly done, then 
take out the chicken and put it in the batter, and pour the 
batter in a deep dish and bake it. White gravy for sauce. 

174, Almond Pudding, 

Shell half a pound of sweet almonds, and pour scalding 
water over them, to make them peeh As they become cool, 
pour on more boiling water, till they are all blanched. 
Blanch also one ounce of peach meats, or bitter almonds, 
throw them into a bowl of cold water as you blanch them. 
Take them out, one by one ; wipe them dry on a clean 
towel ; lay them on a plate ; pound them singly in a marble 
mortar, till of a fine paste, adding a few drops of rose-water 
as you pound, to prevent their oiling : — Pound alternately, 
a sweet and dien a bitter almond, to mix them well, and 
see you make them perfectly fine and smooth ; — ^they are 
improved by being prepared day before they are wanted 
for use. 

Stir four ounces of butter and four ounces of powdered 
white sugar to a cream, and add gradually, a spoonful of 
mixed rose-water, brandy and wine. 

Beat the whites of six eggs, till they stand alone ; stir 
them and the almonds alternately into the butter and sugar, 
and thoroughly mix the whole. Butter a soup plate ; have 
ready a puff paste ; (see receipt for making it) place it on 
the plate, trim and notch it; then put in yi^ur pudding* 
bake about half an hour, in a moderate oven ; and grate W 
0ugar over it.

This maybe made still plainer ;— or a little richer, by the 
addition of two or three eggs, and a little chopped suet. 
Boil three hours: — if six, the better — some cooks boil eight 
or nine hours. When so long, seven hours of the boiling 
should be given the day before the pudding is to be eaten-* 
this is good fried when cold.

209. Carrot Pudding. 

Boil tender, six carrots of middling size ; pound, sift, and 
mix them with a pint of cream ; sugar, spice, and orange to 
the taste , bake in a dish lined with a thin, rich paste, frinn 
thirty to forty five minutes. 

210. To Make Musk, — Southern Name. 
Put a lump of butter as large as a hen's egg into a quart 
of water ; add a little salt ; then Indian meal, stirring it per- 
fectly smooth, enough to make it sufficiently thick when 
boiled. Stir constantly, to prevent burning, till it is boiled 
enough. 

211. Hasty Pudding. 

Make a thick batter of sifted Indian meal and cold water ; 
stir the batter gradually into a pot of boiling water ; after 
boiling about an hour, stir in gradually, by the handful, sifted 
Indian meal ; do this at short intervals, stirring smartly to- 
wards the finishing, to prevent lumps, till the pudding is so 
thick that the stick may be made to stand up in it ; salt to 
the taste ; boil slowly, and stir frequently to prevent burning 
to the pot. 

Boil an hour and a half; if to be fried, two and a half; 
and it will fry the better if one or two handfuls of flour be 
stirred in at the last. Let it get quite cold before frying ; 
then cut in slices half an inch thick, roll in flour, and brown 
them in lard. 

212. Potato Pudding. 

Boil three large mealy potatoes ; mash them perfectly 
smooth, with one ounce of butter, and two or three of thick 
cream ; add three eggs, a spoonful of brown sugar, a little 
salt and nutmeg. Beat all well together, and if a few cur- 
rants be added, the better. Bake in a buttered dish, thi^ 
minutes, in an oven ; or forty GiVe in a Dutch oven.

cover it with bits of citron. Make Irish potato pudding in 
the samo way. Eight eggs, one pound sugar, one sweet 
potatoes, half pound butter. 

214. Puff Pudding. 
Add to six well beaten eggs, eight spoonfuls of flour, and 
six of milk smoothly mixed, and put all into one quart oi 
milk ; turn the batter into buttered cups, and bake them 
quickly. Turn them out ; and eat them with butter, sujgar 
end nutmeg; or sauce to the liking. Eight eggs, four 
spoons of flour, and a pint of milk. 

215. Boston Best. 

Mix with four quarts of milk, eight well beaten eggs ; 
make this mixture quite thick, with stale bread, and four 
pounds of best box raisins, adding sugar enough to make it 
very sweet, a little salt, and spices to the taste. Seed and 
flour the raisins. Bake about an hour and a half, or till 
done : it is excellent when cold. 

216. Apple Dumplings. 

With a narrow knife, take out the core of pared, tart, . 
mellow apples ; and fill the place of the core, with sugar ; 
roll out some good pie crust about two thirds of an inch 
thick, and cut it into pieces of just sufRcient size to roll the 
apple in. Lay an apple on each piece, and inclose it en- 
tirely, tying up in a smooth thick piece of cloth that has 
been well floured. Put in a pot of boiling water, and boil 
the dumplings an hour without intermission. They will 
otherwise be hard. 

Eat them with butter and sugar, or with pudding sauce. 

217. Plain Fritters. 

Stir a quart of milk gradually into a pound of flour ; add 
seven well beaten eggs, and a teaspoonful of salt. Drop 
them by the spoonful into hot lard, and fry them of a light 
brown. They are the less greasy, fried in just sufficient 
fat to keep them from sticking to the pan, but the lighter 
fried in a great deal of fat ; serve out with liquid pudding 
sauce

218. Cream Fritters. 

Mix a pint and a half of flour with a pii t of milk ; stir ia 
six well beaten eggs ; add half a nutmeg ; then two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt, and a pint of cream ; stir the whole just 
enough to intermix the cream, then fry in small cakes ; tho 
addition of a few tender apples chopped fine improves the 
fritters. 

, 219. Spanish Fritters. 

Mix early in the morning a quart of flour with a well 
beaten eggy a spoonful of yeast, and milk enough to make 
it a little softer than muffin dough, adding a little salt. 
When well risen, work in two spoonfuls of drawn butter ; 
make the mixture into balls, the size of a walnut, and fry 
them till of a light brown, in boiling lard ; eat them with 
molasses, wine and sugar, or a sauce prepared. 

220. Mock Oysters of Green Com, 

Mix a pint of grated green corn, with three spoonfuls ot

spoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, and one egg. 
Drop by the spoonful into hot butter ; let the cakes fry from 
eight to ten minutes. 

221. Indian Com Cake. 

Make a thick batter of a quart of sour, or butter milk, 
two of sifted Indian meal, a little salt, and two teaspoonfuls 
of saleratus ; if a little cream the better. Bake an hour 
in deep pans. If sour milk be wanting, boil sweet, and 
turn on the meal. When cool, put in three eggs to a quart 
of meal, salting to the taste. 

222. Pastry and Pies. 

Take nine pounds of flour, three of butter, one of lard, 
and three pints of cold water. Spread six pounds of the 
flour on the board in a ring. Put the lard in the ring, and 
work it into the flour with water, putting in the watec very 
gradually, till the six pounds of flour are worked in. Roll 



88 PASTRY AND FIBS. 

up the paste, working in all the scraps on the board until 
the paste is smooth.. From the remaining three pounds of 
flour sprinkle the board and roll out the paste. Repeat this 
till 'tis quite smooth. Divide the butter into two parts. 
Flour each part. Put one part in the end of the long sheet 
of cnist. Give it a roll or two ; then put in the other part, 
in the same manner^ and roll up the whole like a scroll ; 
roll it till very light, turning it on die pin at each roll ; then 
fold it together like a sheet four times. When folded, cut 
into strips the width of the pie plate, and roll out thin enough 
for the pie, and roll it over the pin ; then unroll it over the 
line of plates. Wet the lower crust, which should be thin, 
when on the plate, before filling. Then after filling, roll 
out the upper crust on both sides till even ; and from the 
pin, unroll, and spread over the line of plates, leaving the 
paste half an inch thick. 

The handsomest ornamental edging for pie or pudding, is 
the cutting into large squares, the edge of the crust, and 
folding over one comer of it ; the lid of the pie should be 
pricked, or a lip cut in the top. 

223. Common Paste for Pies. — No. 1. 

To make one large pie, or two small ones, take a pound 
and a half of sifted flour, an<J twelve ounces of washed but- 
ter. Sift the flour into a pan. Divide the butter into two 
equal parts. Cut up one half into the flour as small as pos- 
sible. Mix it thoroughly with the flour, wetting it gradu- 
ally with a little cold water. Strew some flour over your 
paste board, take the lump of paste out of the pan, flour your 
rolling piri, and roll out the paste into a large sheet, roUing 
from you. Stick the sheet over with the remaining butter 
in small pieces placed at equal distances. Sprinkle on a 
little flour, fold up the sheet, flour it lightly, and roll it out 
again. Then fold it up, cut it in two, or in four, according 
to the size of your pies. Roll it out into round sheets the 
size of your pie plates, now pressing rather harder on the 
rolling pin. iJutter your pie plates, place the under crust, 
and trim the edge. Fill the dish with what is to constitute 
the pie, and put on the lid, pricking some holes, or cutting 
a smftU slit in the top. Crimp the edges with a sharp knife.

224. Common Pasta/. — No. 2. 

For a good common pie-crust, calculate half a pound of 
shortening to a pound of flour ; or the same proportion as iu 
No. 1. If you wish a very short crust, instead of one half, 
take three quarters of the weight of shortening that you take 
of flour. 

Pie-crust looks the fiandsomest made wholly of lard, but 
it does not taste so well as to have a proportion of butter 
Beef shortening mixed with butter, makes good plain pie- 
cnist, in the cold season. Rub half of the shortening with 
two thirds of the flour ; and to each pound of flour put a tea- 
spoonful of salt. When the shortening is completely mixed 
with the flour, add just enough cold water to make it sufli- 
ciently moist to roll out easSy. Divide the crust into two 
equal portions — ^lay one of them by for the npper crust ; roll 
out the other quite thin, flouring yoiur rolling board and pin, 
that the crust will not stick to them, and line youripie plates, 
previously buttering them ; fill your plates with what is to 
constitute the pie ; rollout the upper crust as thin as possi- 
ole ; spread on the reserved shortening, or the other half, and 
sprinkle over it the other portion, or third of the flour Roll 
up your upper crust, and cut it into as many pieces as you 
have pies to cover. Roll each one out to its desired 
thickness, and cover the pies : trim off" the edges neatly 
with a knife, and press down the crust ; round the edge of 
the plate with a jagging iron, to prevent the escape of the 
juices while baking. Pastry should be baked, in a quick 
oven to be nice. In colcf weather, warm, but do not melt, 
the shortening. The crust will not be flaky if you do. 

225. Common Family Pastry. — No. 3. 

Take one quart of sifted flour, two teacups of lard, and 
one of butter. Reserve a handful of flour, and the cup of 
butter for your upper crust. Mix the lard well with the 
flour by rubbing them together with sufficient water to mois- 
ten the mass, as before directed ; Lay by one half of it 
for the upper crust; and line the bottom of the pie plates.

heaping full, where the ingredients admit of it ; use the re- 
served butter and handful of flour for the upper crust, and 
place it, when shaped, on the top. 

226. Puff Paste, 

To make puff paste for one soup plate pie, for four small 
shells; (or for two puddings:) take ten ounces of sifted 
flour,. eight ounces of best fresh butter washed, and a little 
cold water. Sift the flour through a fine hair sieve into a 
broad deep pan ; lay aside one quarter of it, on a comer 
of your paste board, to roll and sprinkle with ; after washed, 
squeeze the butter hard with your hands, and shape it into 
a rpund ball ; divide it into four equal parts ; lay them one 
side of your paste board, and have on hand a glass of cold 
water. Cut one of the four pieces of butter into the pan as 
small as possible ; wet the contents of the pan gradually, 
with a very little water, (too much will make it tough) and 
mix it well with the point of a large case knife ; do not touch 
it with the hand. When the dough shapes into a lump, 
sprinkle some of the flour you laid aside on the middle of 
the board, and lay the dough upon it, turning it out of the 
pan with the knife. Flour the rolling pin, and the lump of 
paste ; roll the paste out thin, quickly, and evenly, pressing 
on the rolling*pin very lightly ; thgn take the second of the 
^our pieces of butter, and with the point of your knife, stick 
^n little bits at equal distances all over the sheet of paste. 
Sprinkle over some flour, and fold up the paste. Flour 
the paste board and rolling pin again ; and throw a little 
flour on the paste, and roll it out ^ second time. Stick the 
third piece of butter all over the sheet, in little bits. Throw 
on some flour, fold up the paste, sprinkle a little more flour 
on the dough, and on the rolling pin, and roll it out a third 
time, always pressing lightly. Stick it over with the fourth 
and last piece of butter. 

Throw on a little more flour, fold up the paste, and then 
roll it out in a large round sheet. Cut ofi" the sides, so as ' 
to make the sheet of a square form, and lay the slips of 
dough upon the square sheet. Fold it up with the small 
pieces of trimmings inside. Score and notch it a little with 
the knife ; lay it on a plate and set it away in a cool place, 
bm not where it will freeze, as that will make it heavy. 



PASTRY AND P[ES. 91 

Having made the paste, prepare and mix your pie or pud- 
ding. When the mixture is finished, fetch out your paste, 
flour your board and rolling pin, and roll out your paste 
with a short quick stroke, pressing the rolling pin rather 
harder than while you were putting the butter in. If the 
paste rises in blisters, it will be light, unless spoiled in 
baking. 

Cut the sheet in halves, fold both separately, and roll out 
each once more, in round sheets, the size of your plates, 
pressing on rather harder, but not too hard. Roll the sheets 
thinnest in the middle, and thickest at the edges. If inten- 
ded for puddings, lay the sheets in buttered soup plates, and 
trim them evenly round the edges. If the edges do not ap- 
pear thick enough, take the trimmings, put them all together, 
roll them, out, and having cut them in slips the width of the 
rim of your plate, lay them all round to make the paste 
thicker at the edges, joining them nicely and evenly, as 
every patch or crack will appear distinctly when baked. 
Notch the rim handsomely with a very sharp knife. Fill 
the dish with the mixture of the pudding, and bake it in a 
moderate oven. The paste should be of a light brown color. 
If the oven is too slow, it will be soft and clammy : if too 
quick, it will not have time to rise so high as it ought. 

227. Confectioner's Pastry. 

Take five parts of flour to four of shortening ; or weigh 
out a pound and a quarter of flour, and a pound of butter. 
Rub one-third of the butter with two-thirds of the flour, ad- 
ding a teaspoonful of salt. When the butter is thoroughly 
mixed with the flour, add one beaten egg, and cold water, 
to moisten enough to roll out. Sprinkle part of the reserv- 
ed flour on a board ; cut the butter into small pieces, and 
roll out the pieces as thin as possible. In order to roll them 
very thin, you must sprinkle a great deal of the flour on the 
moulding board and rolling pin. Lay the butter, as fast as 
rolled out, on a floured plate, each piece by itself. 

Roll out the pastry as thin as it can be rolled ; cover it 
with the rolled butter ; sprinkle on part of the reserved 
flour, and roll the crust up. Continue to roll out the crusty 
and put on the reserved butter and flour, till the whole is 



92 PASTRY AND PIES 

ased ; now roll it out lightly, about half an inch thick, for 
the upper crust or rim to your pies. Use plain pie cmst 
for the lining of your plates or the under crust. Puff pas* 
try should be baked in a quick oven till of a light brown, to 
be nice. If it browns before the fruit in the pie is suffi- 
ciently baked, cover it with thick papers.

228. Tart Paste. 

Rub into eight ounces of flour, six of butter, and a spoon- 
ful of powdered sugar. Form it into a thick paste with hot 
water. 

229. Shcart Paste for Fruit Pies. 

Rub into twelve ounces of flour, four ounces of lard and 
a spoonful of powdered sugar. Form it into a paste with 
milk; roll it out, and add four ounces of butter. For a 
fruit tart, roll out half an inch thick. 

230. To make Raised Pie Crust, or Potato Pie Crust,

231. Tomato Pie. 

Pick green tomatoes, pourl)oiling water over them, and 
let them remain a few minutes ; then strip oflf the skin, cut 
the tomatoes in slices, and put them in deep pie plates. 
Sprinkle a little ginger and some sugar over them in several 
layers. Lemon juice, and the grated peel, improve the pie. 
Cover the pies with a thick crust, and bake them slowly 
about an hour. 

232. Mince Pie. See 253}. 

Parboil a beef's heart, or tongue, or a fresh piece of beef. 
When cold, chop very fine two pounds of the lean ; chop 
as fine as possible, two pounds of the inside of beef's suet, 
and mix the meat and the suet together, adding a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Take four pounds of pippin apples, pared, cored 
and chopped fine, two pounds of raisins stoned and chop- 
ped, and two pounds of currants, picked, washed and dried, 
and mix the fruit with the suet and meat. Add two pounds 
of powdered sugar, two grated nutmegs, half an ounce of 
powdered cinnamon, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, a 



PASTRY AND PIES. 9S 

quarter of an ounce of mace, and the grated peel and juice 
of two large oranges ; and wet the whole with a quart of 
Mrhite wine, a quart of brandy, and a wineglass of rose-wa- 
ter, mixing them well together. 

Make a paste, allowing for each pie eight omices of but- 
ter and twelve ounces of sifted flour. Lay a sheet of paste 
all over a soup plate ; fill it with mince meat, laying slips 
of citron on the top, in the proportion of half a pound for 
the entire mixture. Roll out a sheet of paste for the lid of 
the pie ; put it on,iand crimp the edges with a knife ; prick 
holes in the lid, and bake half an hour in a brisk oven. . 

Meat will keep good for pies, several months, if kept in 
a cool dry place, and prepared as follows. To a pound of 
meat chopped fine, and four ounces of suet, put an ounce 
of cinnamon, an ounce of mace, a quarter of an ounce of 
cloves, and two teaspoonfuls of salt, add, if liked, eight oim- 
ces of currants, eight of raisins, and four of citron. Add 
too, a tumbler of brandy or wine, three spoonfuls of molas- 
ses, and sugar enough to make it quite sweet. Put all in 
a stone pot, and cover it with a paper wet in brandy. In 
using it, take equal weights of meat and apples pared and 
chopped fine. If not seasoned enough, add to the taste. 
If the apples are not tart, put in lemon juice or cider. 

233. Plain Minte Pie. 

Neat's tongue and feet make the best mince pies. The 
shank is good. Boil the meat till very tender, take it up, 
clean it from the bones and gristle, chop it &[ie, mix it with 
an equal weight of tart apples chopped fine. If the meat is 
lean, put in a little butter or suet. 'Moisten the whole with 
cider ; new, if you have good ; sweeten it to the taste with 
sugar and a Jittle^ molasses — seasoning with salt, cinnamon, 
cloves, and mace. Make the 4)ies on fleet plates, with 
holes in the upper crust, and bake from thirty to forty five 
minutes. 

234. To Make Mince Meat for Pies 

Boil either beeves' feet, or calves' feet, or hogs' feet, till

pies, one of prepared currants, one of stoned and cut rai- 
sins, one of good brown sugar, one of nicely chopped suet, 
one of cider, and a pint of brandy ; add a teaspoonful - of 
pounded mace, of nutmeg, and of cloves ; and mix all weU 
together. When pies are wanted, take as much of this 
mixture as may be necessary, adding to each quart of it a 
teaspoonful of pepper, and one of salt ; this much improves 
the flavor, and can be easier mixed with a little than with 
the whole mass. Cover the moulds with paste ; put in the 
mince meai; cover the top with fine slips of citron ; and 
crown the whole with a lid garnished around with paste 
cut in fanciful shapes. Bake from thirty to forty minutes. 
They are best hot ; but may be eaten either cold or hot. 
The mince meat may be potted, and kept for use as needed 



235. Apple Pie. 

Green apples, when small, are nice stewed whole, with 
the skins on, and strained when soft, and sweetened. When 
large enough, pare, quarter, and core the apples. If the 
apples are not ripe, stew them with barely water enough to 
prevent their burning. Sweeten them, when soft, and sea- 
son them to the taste. Ripe apples are best for pies, not 
to be stewed. 

Line your plates with a thin paste, fill them, and cover 
them with a thick crust, and bake from thirty to forty min- 
utes. When baked enough, carefully remove the upper 
crust by loosening its edge with a broad knife and sliding 
it on to ^ a plate ; put a piece of butter of nutmeg size into 
each pie ; sweeten it to your taste ; and, if the apples are 
not sufficiently acid, squeeze in a little lemon juice ; and 
season with lemon peel, nutmeg, and rose-water. Replace 
the crust. 

Apples quartered, without paring, and stewed soft in new 
/cider and molasses, make good plain pies. Strain the ap* 
pies, after stewing, and season with nutmeg and cinnamon. 
If made quite sweet, apples thus stewed, strained, and 
seasoned, Will keep good several months. Turn boiling 
water on to dried apples, enough to cover them, and stew 
them till quite soft ; if they are not sufficiently tart, turn in 
•our cider when they are partly done. Stew with the ap-

soft, with sugar and nutmeg, and strain them if you wish. 

236. Rice Pie. 

Turn a quart of boiling water on ten spoonfuls of clean 
rice ; boil till very soft, take it from the fire, and add a quart 
of cold milk, five eggs, a nutmeg, a little salt, sugar to the 
taste, and strain it through a sieve. May add a few rai« 
sins. Bake from thirty to forty minutes, in deep plates, 
with a lining and rim of paste. • 

237. Peach Pie. 

Select mellow, juicy peaches ; wash and place them in 
a deep pie plate lined with paste ; strew a thick layer of su- 
gar on each of peaches, adding a spoonful of water, and a 
sprinkling of flour over ihe top of each layer ; cover with a 
thick crust ; and bake about an hour. The prussic acid of 
the stone imparts a most agreeable flavor to the pie. Stew 
peaches that are hard, before making them into pies. Also, 
stew dried peaches sofl, and sweeten them ; and give them 
no other spice than a few of the meats, blanched and 
pounded fine in a little rose-water. 

238. A Plain Custard Pie. 

Boil a quart of milk with six peach leaves or whh a lem- 
on rind. When the milk is sufficiently flavored, strain, and 
place it where it will boil. Smoothly mix a spoonful of 
flour with two of milk, and stir the mixture into the boiling 
milk. Stirring it constantly, let it boil one minute. Take 
it from the fire ; put in three well-beaten eggs as soon as 
cool ; sweeten to the taste ; pour it into deep pie plates, and 
immediately bake the pies in a quick oven. 

239. Apple Custards. 

Pare, quarter, and core six mellow, tart apples ; set them, 
with six spoonfuls of water, in a pan, on a few coals ; and 
as they soften, turn them into a pudding dish, and sprinkle 
on sugar. Mix eight eggs, beaten with rolled brown sugar, 
with Uiree pints of milk ; grate in half a nutmeg, and turn 
ike whole over the apples. Bake about twenty- five minutes.

teacup of the pulp, rubbed through a sieve, put the same 
measure of sugar, the same of wine, half a teacup of melted 
butter, the juice and grated rind of a lemon, a tumbler of 
milk, four eggs, and half a nutmeg. Mix all the ingre- 
dients well together, and turn into deep pie plates that are 
lined with pastry, with a rim of puff paste round the edge. 
Bake the tarts about thirty minutes. 

242. Lemon Tart. 

Grate the yellow part of the rinds of three lemons ; add 
the juice of one, six whites and twelve yolks of eggs, twelve 
ounces of sugar, and twelve of butter, fi ake in a plate, the 
bottom lined with a paste. 

243. Tart Pie. 

Cranberries, sour apples, and peaches, make good tarts. 
Stew them, and strain when soft. Add a little lemon juice 
to peach tarts, unless the peaches are sour ; and brown su- 
gar and lemon peel to the taste ; put a well-beaten egg in 
each pie to make it cut smooth; and bake on shallow 
plates, with an under crust and rim of pastry. Ornament 
with fine strips of paste ; and when the crust is done, caU 
the pie done. 

244. Rhubarb Pie. 

Strip off the skin, and slice thin, the 'tender stalks of 
rhubarb. Put the rhubarb in deep plates lined with pie • 
crust, with a thick layer of sugar to each layer of rhubarb. 



PASTftT AND PIES. 97 

A little grated lemon peel may be added Place oTer tha 
top a thick crust ; press it tight round the edge of the plate, 
and perforate it with a fork, that the crust may not burst 
while baking, and let the juices of the pie escape. Bake 
about one hour in a slow oven. Rhubarb pie must not be 
quick baked. Some stew rhubarb before making it into 
pies, but it is best without stewing. 

245. Pumpkin Pie. 

Halve, seed, rinse, slice into small strips, and stew the 
pumpkin over a gentle fire, in just water enough to prevent 
burning to the bottom of the pot. After stewed soft, pour off ' 
the water, and steam the pumpkin about eighteen minutes, 
over a slow fjre, seeing that it does not burn. Take it off, 
and strain it, when cool, through a sieve. Put to a quart 
of the pumpkin,, twelve eggs and two quarts of milk, if you 
wish the pies very rich. Put to a quart of the pumpkin, 
three eggs and one quart of milk, if you wish them plain. 
If very plain, put to a quart, one egg, with a spoonful of 
flour, and very little mUk. The more thinned the pumpkin, 
the greater the number of eggs required. Sweeten the 
pumpkin-to the taste, with sugar beaten with the egg^ and 
very little molasses. Lemon peel, nutmeg, and ginger, are 
good seasoning for the pies. As they require a hot oven, 
have the pumpkin scaldmg hot at the time of putting it into 
the plates, to prevent the rim of the pies getting burnt be- 
fore the inside is sufficiently baked. Bake as soon as the 
plates are filled, to prevent the crust becoming clammy. 
The fewer the eggs in the pies, the longer the time re- 
quired to bake them. Pumpkin may be kept several months 
in cold weather, by making it, after stewed, very sweet, 
and strong of ginger, and dien scalding it well. Keep it 
in a cool place, in a stone jar. Take out what you want 
at any time, and put to it the milk and eggs. 

246. Lemon Pie.

247. Grape Pie. 

When green and tender, grapes make a good pie. Stew 
and strain the grapes, unless very small, to separate the 
seeds, before making them into pies, and sweeten them to 
the taste. They need no spice. If made into a pie with- 
out stewing, put to each layer of grapes a spoonful of water, 
after a thick layer of sugar. 

248. Currant and Gooseberry Pte. 

Currants and gooseberries may be used for pies, when 
ripe ; but they are best just before turning red, and of full 
growth. Mixed with ripe mulberries or raspberries, cur- 
rants make fine pies. As the juice of the currants is apt 
to run out while the pies are baking, and leave the fruit dry, 
and not sufficiently sweet, scald in the sugar before they 
are baked. Stew them on a moderate fire, with twelve 
spoonfuls of water to two quarts of currants ; as soon as 
they begin to crack, put in the sugar and scald it in, a few 
minutes. If baked without stewing, add a thick layer of 
sugar to each of fruit — ^four ounces of sugar to a pint of 
currants. Green currant pies are good sweetened with 
sugar and molasses mixed. 

249. Fruit Pies in Variety. 

In making pies from ripe summer fruit, raspberries, black- 
berries, damsons, cherries, &;c., always take a deep plate, 
line it with paste, place in the middle an inverted teacup, 
and fill the plate with fruit Brown sugar and spice to the 
taste: The cup thus placed, will receive the juice, which 
would otherwise escape at the edges of the pie. It will 
•ettle under the cup ; which remove on cutting the pie. 

250. Delicate Pie of Sweetbread and Oysters. 
The sweetbread of veal is the most delicious part. Boil 
t tender ; stew some oysters ; season with pepper and salt,

and thicken with cream, butter, the yolk of eggs, and flour; 
iine a deep dish with a puff paste ; take up the oysters 
with an egg spoon ; lay them on the bottom ; cover them 
with the sweetbread ; fill the dish with gravy ; put over it 
a paste top, and bake^it. 

251. Cream Pie. 

Take five well-beaten eggs, and a pint of swQct thiol 
cream ; beat with the eggs sufficient good dry sugar to make 
the cream very sweet ; add seeded raisins ; and season 
with nutmeg and very little salt — mace and citron, if wanted 
very nice. Line deep plates with a paste with a little left 
for a rim. Bake till the cream is stiff set, so as not to be 
milky. ^ 

252. Connecticut Thanksgiving Chicken Pie. 

In sufficient water to prevent burning, stew old not young 
fowls, jointed, all but tender enough for the table. Pour 
all into a dish, and season with salt and pepper to the taste. 
. When about cold, place the parts in your pudding dish, 
lined with a thin common paste, adding about half a pound 
of butter to three pounds of fowl, in 'alternate layers. 
Take more of the paste ;^ roll it nine times, studding it each 
time with butter, (it must be made very rich ;) be careful to 
roll out, each time, from you, and to roll up towards you, 
leaving it, at least, an inch thick. Add the upper crust ; 
cut a lip in it ; and ornament it with some of the reserved 
paste, having first lightly sprinkled the chickens with flour, 
after almost filling the dish with the liquor in which the 
chickens were stewed. Pin tight around the rim of the 
dish a cloth bandage, to prevent the escape of the juices ; 
and bake from an hour to an hour and a half, in a quick 
oven. If the top burns, lay a paper over it. 

253. Common Chicken Pie. 

Prepare the chickens, and place them in a deep pudding 
dish, as by preceding rule. Put three or four slices of pork 
to each' layer of chicken. Add some of the liquor in which 
tlioy were boiled, and two ounces of butter, in small piedes. 
Sprinkle over a little flour ; cover with a nice crust, orna- 
uicntin<' with the same ; and bake one hour, in a quick oven 



100 CUSTAR1I8. 

253i. Richmond Mince Pie, 232. 
To two pounds lean beef, two suet, two raisins, two aj>- 
ples— -chopped fine — add four ounces allspice, two cloves, 
and one of mace, with one quart of wine and one of brandy. 
Moisten with sweet cider when {)reparing it for the paste. 

254. Almond Custard, No. 1. 

Take one pint of rich milk, one of cream, half a pound 
of shelled sweet almonds, two ounces of shelled bitter al- 
monds, four spoonfuls of rose-water, four ounces of white 
sugar, the yolks of eight eggs, and a little oil of lemon ; 
blanch the almonds and pound them to a paste, mixing the 
rose-water gradually with ihem ; powder the sugar, and 
beat the yolks till very light ; mix the milk and cream to- 
gether, and stir in gradually, the sugar, the pounded al- 
monds, and the beaten yolks. Stir the whole very hard. 
Put the mixture into a skillet or sauce pan, and set it in a 
heated stove, or on a charcoal furnace. Stir it one way 
till it becomes thick, but take it off before it curdles. Set 
it awfiy to get cold. Talfe half the whites of the eggs* 
beat them well, adding a little powdered sugar, and a few 
drops of oil oF lemon. Put the custard into a glass bowl 
or dish, and heap the frothed white of an egg upon it. Or- 
nament the top with nonpareils, or sugar sand. Or put the 
custard in small cups, piling some froth on each. 

255. Almond Custard, No. 2. 

Blanch, and pound fine, four ounces of almonds, with a 
spoonful of rose-water ; boil them four or five minutes in a 
quart of milk, with sugar enough to sweeten the milk ; re- 
move it from the fire ; when lukewarm, stir in the well- 
beaten yolks of eight eggs, and the whites of four ; set all 
on the fire and stir constantly till it thickens. Then take 
it up ; stir it till partly cooled, and turn it into cups. Set 
the cups into a pan of cold water, if you wish to have the 
custards cool quick. As soon as the water gets warm 
change it. Just before the custards are to be eaten, beat 
the reserved whites of the other four eggs to a froth, and 
pile them on the top of the custards. 

256. Soft Custard. • 

Take a quart of cream or milk, the yolks only pf siiyieen 
eggs, six ounces of powdered white sugar half an ounce 



CUSTARDS. 101 

of cinnamon broken in small pieces, a large handful of 
peach leaves, or half an ounce of peach kernels, or bitter 
almonds, broken in pieces, a spoonful of rose-water, and a 
nutmeg ; and boil in the milk, the cinnamon, and the peach 
kernels or leaves. When it has boiled, set it away till cold. 
Strain it through a sieve, soon as cold, to clear it of tho 
cinnamon, leaves, &c., and stir into it gradually, the sugar, 
spice, and rose-water. Stir by degrees the sixteen yolks, 
beaten very light, into the milk, which must be quite cold, 
or the eggs will make it curdle. Put the custards into cups 
and set them in a baking pan half filled with water. When 
baked, grate some nutmeg over each, and ice them. Make 
the icing of the whites of eight eggs, a heaping teaspoon- 
ful of powdered loaf sugar, and six drops of essence of 
lemon, beaten all togethei till it stands alone. Pile up 
some of the icing on the top of each custard. 

257. Rennet Custards. — See " To Make Rennet^ 

Take half a pint of cream and a quart of new milk mixed, 
four ounces of powdered white sugar, a large glass of white 
wine in which an inch of washed rennet has been soaked, 
and a nutmeg ; mix together, in a pitcher, the milk, cream, 
and sugar ; stir in the wine ; and pour the mixture into 
your custard cups. Set them in a warm place near the 
fire, till they become a firm curd. Then set them on ice, 
or in a cold place. Grate nutmeg over them. 

258. Cream Custards, 

Sweeten a pint of cream with powdered white sugar, and 
set it on a few coals. When hot, mix with it white wine 
till it curdles. Add rose-water, or essence of lemon, to the 
taste, and turn it into cups. 

Another very nice way of making custards, is to mix a 
pint of milk with a pint of cream, five beaten eggs, three 
spoonfuls of sugar, and two of flour, adding nutmeg to the 
taste, then baking in cups or in pie plates, in a quick oven. 

259 Boiled Custards, 
Set your milk on the fire, and let it boil up. Remove 
it from the fire, and let it cool. Beat for each quart of milk, 



102 CAKES, GINGERBREAD, AND NUTS. 

if liked rich, the yolks and half the whites of six eggs, with 
three spoonfuls of rolled sugar. Stir them into the milk 
when cool. For very plain custards, four eggs are suffi- 
cieilt for a quart of milk. Season the custard with nutmeg 
or rose-water ; set it on a few coals ; and stir it constantly, 
till it thickens and becomes scalding hot. Remove it from 
the fire before boiling. Stir it a few minutes, and turn it 
into cups. Beat to a stiff froth the reserved whites of the 
eggs, and pile them on the top of the custards just before 
they are to be eaten. 

260. Mottled Custards, 

Stir the beaten yolks of six eggs into a quart of boiling 
milk ; one minute after the yolks have set so as to be thick, 
stir in the whites well beaten, with three spoonfuls of su- 
gar, if liked very sweet. Season with rose-water, or essence 
of lemon; stir till it becomes lumpy and thick, and then 
turn it into cups. 

, 261. Milk Custards. 

Make a quart of milk quite hot, that it may not whey 
when baked ; let it stand till cold ; then mix with it, eight 
eggs ; sweeten with loaf sugar, and flavor with essence of 
lemon and rose-water. Fill the custard cups ; put on the 
covers ; and set them in the oven, in a dripping pan half 
filled with boiling water. When the water has boiled ten 
or fifteen minutes, take out a cup, and if the custard is the 
consistency of jelly, it is sufiiciently done. 

262. Cakes, Gingerbread, Nuts, ^c. 

General directions. — Cake, to be nice, must be made of 
nice materials, and must be nicely made. The butter, eggs, 
and flour should all be fresh. Brown sugar does very well 
for most kinds of cake if rolled free from lumps, and stirred 
to a cream with the butter, or until white ; then adding 
the eggs, flour, and spices. The sugar should be dry, and 
of a light color. The flour should be sifted, and if not per- 
fectly dry, it will make the cake heavy. The whites and 
yolks of the eggs should be beaten to a froth, separately. 
Salaeratus and soda should be completely dissolved, and fil- 



CAKES* GINGERBREAD, AND NUTS. 103 

terod before put into the cake. Raisins should have tho 
seeds taken out, or he stoned. Zante currants should be 
rinsed in several waters to cleanse them, rubbed in a dry 
cloth to get the sticks out, and then spread on platters and 
thoroughly dried. Almonds should be blanched and dried, 
then pounded fine with a little rose-water to prevent their 
oiling. In cold weather the ingredients for cake should be 
ivarmed moderately before mixing them. All kinds of cake 
made without yeast are better for being stirred just before 
they are baked. Salaeratus and cream should not be put in 
till just before the cake is baked ; add the fruit last. But- 
ter the cake pans well ; and if the pans are lined with but- 
tered white paper the cake will be less liable to burn. 
Moving cake while baking tends to make it heavy ; avoid 
the moving of it if possible. The quicker most kinds of 
cake are baked, without burning, the better — the lighter. 

It is impossible to give definite rules as to the time re- 
quired for baking cake. It should be often looked at while 
baking ; if it browns too fast, a cover of white paper should 
be put over it. To know when rich cake is done, run a 
clean broom splinter through the thickest part of the loaf, 
and if none of the cake adheres to the splinter, it is baked 
enough. Cake that easily moves on the flat tins on which 
it is baked, is done enough. 

263, Frosting for Cake. 

Allow for the white of one _egg, nine large teaspoonfuls of 
double refined sugar, and one of nice Poland starch, both 
powdered and sifted through a very fine sieve. Beat the 
whites of eggs so stiff they will adhere to the bottom of the 
plate on turning it upside down; then stir the sugar in 
gradually, stirring constantly about fifteen minutes; add 
a teaspoonful of lemon juice, or essence of lemon, or a 
little rose-water. Stir in a few grains of cochineal powder, 
or rose pink, if you wiah to color pink ; or of the pow- 
der blue, if you wish to have it of a blueiah tinge. Before 
idng a cake, dredge it all over with flour, and then wipe 
off the flour ; the icing may thus be spread on more even- 
ly. Lay the frosting on the cake with a knife, soon 
after it is drawn from the oven, (it may be either warm or 



104 CAKES, GINGERBREAD, AND NUTS. 

cold ;) smooth it over, and set in a cool place till hanL 
Allow the whites of three eggs foY two common sized loaves. 
The appearance of the cake will be much improved by icing 
it twice. Put on the first icing soon after the cake is taken 
out of the oven, and the second the next day, after the first 
is perfectly dry. 

Before cutting an iced cake, cut the icing first, by itsej, 
by pressing the back of the knife nearest the blade 'end 
across the cake, to prevent the cracking and breaking of the 
icing. Frosting is best, made hy heating from 3 to 4 spoom- 
fuls sugar with 1 egg-white^ adding teaspoonful lemon juice. 

' 264. Lemon Cake, 

Take one teacup of butter, and three of powdered loaf 
sugar ; rub them to a cream ; stir into them the yolks of 
five eggs well beaten ; dissolve a teaspoonful of salacratus 
in a teacup of milk, and add the milk ; add the juice and 
grated peel of one lemon, and the whites of the ^ve eggs ; 
and sift in, as light as possible, four teacups of fiour. Bake 
in two long tins about half an hour. Much improved by 
icing. 

265. Rich Queen Cake, 

Take a mixed teaspoonful of powdered and sifted mace 
and cinnamon, and one nutmeg; put one pound of powdered 
white sugar into a deep earthern pan, and cut one pound of 
fresh butter washed to it, and stir them till very light. 
Beat ten eggs in a broad shallow platter till perfectly 
smooth and thick ; and take fourteen ounces of sifted fiour ; 
stir into the butter and sugar a little of the beaten egg, and 
then a little of the flour, and so on alternately, till the whole 
is in ; all the time beating the eggs and stirring the mixture 
very hard. Add, by degrees, the spice ; and then, a little 
at a time, a mixed wineglass of brandy and wine, and half 
a glass of rose-water, or twelve drops of essence of lemon.^ 
Stir the whole very hard, adding a pound and a half of well 
prepared currants. 

Take about two dozen little tins, and rub them well with 
fresh butter. Put some of the mixture, with a spoon in each 
tin, not filling it, as it will rise high in baking. Bake about 
fifteen minutes, in a quick oven. When done, the cakes 
will shrink a little from the sides of the tins. Make an 



CAKES, GINGERBREAD, AND NUTS. 105 

icing with the whites of three eggs, beaten till it stands 
alone, and twenty-four teaspoonfuls of the best of loaf sugar 
powdered, and beaten gradually into the egg. Flavor it 
with a teaspoonful of rose-water, or eight drops of the essence 
of lemon, stirred, in at the last. Spread it evenly, with a 
broad knife, over the top of each queen cake, ornamenting 
while the icing is quite wet, with fine sugar sand, dropped 
on carefully with the thumb and finger. Set them in a 
warm place to dry ; but^not too near the fire, as that will 
cause the icing to crack. 

266. Family £iueen Cake. 

Take a pound of sifted flour, one of sugar, and three- 
quarters of butter ; rub the butter and sugar to a cream ; add 
the well-beaten yolks of five eggs, one gill of wine, one of 
brandy, and one of cream, with part of the flour, and a pound 
of stoned raisins, or well prepared currants, and spices to 
the taste ; and then add the whites of the five eggs beaten 
to a stiflf froth, with the remainder of the flour. 

267. Sponge Cake, No. 1. 

Beat twelve eggs as light as possible, (for sponge and 
almond cake they require more beating than for any thing 
else ;) beat a pound of loaf sugar, powdered and sifted, by 
degrees, into the eggs, continuing to beat sometime very 
hard after all the the sugar is in ; (none but loaf sugar will 
make light sponge cake.) Stir in, gradually, a powdered 
teaspoonful of mixed cinnamon and mace, a grated nutmeg, 
and twelve drops of lemon essence ; lastly, by degrees, put 
in ten ounces of sifted flour, dried near the fire, stirring 
round the mixture very slowly with a knife. If the flour is 
stirred too hard the cake will be tough. It must be done 
gently and lightly, so that the top of the mixture will be 
covered with bubbles. As soon as the flour is all in, begin 
to bake, as setting will hurt it. 

Put it in small tins, well buttered, or in one large tin pan. 
The thinner the pans, the better for sponge cake. Fill the 
small tins about half full. Grate loaf sugar over the top of 
each before setting them in the oven. When baked, turn 
")ver the cakes and frost them

brandy, and half a glass of rose-water, mixed, and a pound 
of citron. 

Pick the currants clean ; wash, and drain them through a 
colander; wipe them in a towel; spread them on a large 
dish, placed slanting near the fire or in the hot sun ; when 
dry, sprinkle them well, and the raisins, stoned and halved, 
with sifted flour, to prevent their sinking to the bottom of 
the cake. Take twice as much cinnamon as mace, sii^, 
and mix them with the nutmeg ; mix the liquor and rose- 
water in a tumbler ; cut the citron in slips ; sift the flour 
into a broad dish ; and sift the sugar into a broad deep 
earthen pan, cut in the butter, and stir them to a cream, first 
warming them near the fire if the weather is too cold to 
have them easily mix. Beat the eggs as light as possible ; 
stir them alternately with the flour, into the butter and su- 
gar, stirring very hard; add gradually the spice and liquor; 
stir alternately the raisins and currants into the mixture ; 
and then, after all the ingredients are in, stir the whole as 
hard as possible ten or fifteen minutes. Line the bottom 
and sides of a large tin or earthern pan with sheets of white 
paper well buttered, and put into it some of the mixture ; 
spread on it some of the citron, not cut too fine ; put in 
more of the mixture ; then another layer of the citron ; and 
so on, till it is all in, having a layer of the mixture on the top.

Take two ounces of blanched bitter almonds, pounded 
very fine; seven ounces of flour, sifted and dried, ten eggs, 
one pound of loaf .sugar, powdered and sifted, and two 
spoonfuls of rose-watei;. Scald the two ounces of bitter 
almonds, or peach kernels, throwing them, as you peel them, 
into a bowl of cold water, then wiping them dry, and pound- 
ing them singly, till fine and smooth, in a marble mortar, 
with a little rose-water to keep them from oiling. Beat 
well and separately the whites and the yolks of the eggs. 
Add the sugar gradually to the yolks, beating it in very 
hard ; beat in the almonds by degrees, and then add the 
rose-water. Stir half of the whites into the yolks and su- 
gar. Divide the flour into two equal parts, and stir in one 
half, slowly and lightly, till it bubbles on the top ; then the 
other half of the whites, and the rest of the flour, very 
lightly. Butter a large square tin pan ; put in the mixture ; 
and set immediately in a quick oven, wluch must be rather 
hotter at the bottom than at the top. If allowed to get slack 
the cake will be spoiled. Make an icing with the whites 
of three eggs, twenty-four teaspoonfuls of loaf sugar, and 
eight drops of essence of lemon. When the cake is cool, 
mark it in small squares with a knife ; cover it with icing; 
and ornament, while wet, with nonpareils to your fancy

ceipt for " Almond Cake ;" but do not divide the whitcjs of 
the eggs, nor the flour. After mixing the yolks, the sugar, 
the almonds, and the lemon essence ; beat in, gradually, the 
whites of the eggs, continuing to beat for some time after

343. Convenient Yeast. 

Receipt of an excellent Virginia housekeeper in Wi 
lianisburg. The bread will never sour ; and it may be bake 
the same morning the yeast is made. Put into sufficiei 
water, two quarts of wheat bran, one pint of Indian bra. 
a handful of hops, and a teacup of parched corn, and boii 
all together ; strain it ; when all but cold, stir in a teacu»* 
of molasses, and add sufficient old yeast to make it ferment 
then turn off the white scum and bottle it. Mix some ol 
the yeast with a little flour, in a teacup, adding a little su- 
gar ; and set it near the fire about one hour before wanted 
for use. Take off from the dough a piece for use, any 
time during the day. If some of the dough is reserved foi 
light and tender biscuit for tea; work down the dough; adt 
a little butter; mould your biscuit; warm and oil youi 
baker, and warm the lid and bake. 

344. Milk Yeast, 

It is very nice for biscuit. Take half the milk wanted 
for your biscuit ; place it where warm, adding a little flour 
and salt. When light, mix it with the rest of the milk, and 
use it directly for the biscuit. A pint of this yeast is suffi- 
cient for five or six loaves of bread. It makes sweeter 
bread than any other yeast, but it will not keep. 

345. Potato Yeast. 

Peel and boil soft, a large Irish potato ; rub it through a 
sieve ; add an equal quantity of flour ; make it liquid with 
hop tea ; when a little warmer than new milk, add a gill of 
good yeast. Stir it well, and keep it closely covered in a 
small pitcher. 

346. Patent Yeast. 

Put half a pound of fresh hops to a gallon of water, and 
boil it away to two quarts ; strain it, and add enough flour 
to make it a tliin batter ; then add half a pint of good yeast 
When well fermented, turn it into a bowl, and work in suf- 
ficient com meal to make it of the consistency of biscui 
dough. Let it ritje. When quite light, make it into little

cakes, and dry them ia the shade, turning them frequently, 
and keeping them free from damp and dust. 

Where brewer's yeast can be had, it will be more con- 
venient to take a quart of that, and a quart of water, about 
milk warm, and work in enough Indian meal to make it the 
consistency of biscuit dough, and then proceed as with the 
two quarts of hop water. 

To prepare the cakes for use, take one or more of the 
cakes, according to your flour ; turn on a little warm water; 
when it is dissolved, stir it well ; thicken with a little flour, 
and set it near the fire to rise before it is used. The best 
thing to keep yeast in is a small mug or pitcher, with a close 
stopper, under which phirf^e a double fold of linen, to make 
it quite close. This is much preferable to a bottle, and is 
easier cleaned. 

347. Wheat Bread, 

Take for half a dozen sized loaves of bread, three pints 
of boiling water ; and mix it with G^ve or six quarts of flour. 
After thoroughly mixed, add three pints of cold water and 
stir the whole to the same temperature. When lukewarm, 
stir in half a pint of family yeast, or a gill of brewer's yeast, 
and a spoonful of salt ; and knead in flour, free of lumps, 
till stiflf enough to mould up. The bread is improved by 
much kneading. Cover it over with a thick cloth, and if 
the weather is cold, place it near the fire. To know when 
it is risen, cut it through the middle with a knife, and if full 
of small holes like a sponge it is light enough for baking ; 
and it should be baked imm.ediately. If it should get sour 
before you are ready to bake, dissolve two or more tea- 
spoonfuls of salaeratus, according to its acidity, in a teacup 
of milk or water ; strain it on the dough ; work it in well ; 
then cut off" enough for a loaf; mould it up neatly ; gash it' 
on both sides to prevent cracking when baked : and set it in 
a buttered tin pan. Let pans stand 10 or 12 minutes before 
baking, and in the oven hour and half, if you wish bread 
baked much. If the wheat is grown, the bread is better 
wet up entirely with boiling water. It should cool before 
adding the yeast. Some think the life of the flour is killed 
by scalding — mistake ; the bread will be sweeter ; and it 



26 ORISAJ}. 

will keep the longer good. Thus wet up, the bread i 
nearly as good as if wet' with milk. Do not put in th 
yeast while the dough is hot; by its scalding the year 
it will kill the life of it. Most ovens need heating aboi 
an hour and a half. The doors of the room should be kej 
shut, if the weather is cold ; and a brisk fire kept up. Ti 
know if your oven is of a right temperature, when cleanet 
throw in a httle flour ; if it brown in the course of a minute 
it has a right heat ; if it turns immediately black, wait 
few minutes"\)efore setting in. If the oven does not bak . 
well, set in a furnace of live coals. A mixture of pine and 
ash, birch, and maple, are all good oven wood. 

348, Excellent Family Bread. 

Take a peck of sifted flour, half a pint of family yeast, or 
a gill of brewer's yeast ; and wet up, with new milk of 
natural warmth, or with skim milk, or water milkwann, 
adding a little shortening and a teaspoonful of salt. Knead 
it faithfully. Be particular to leave the dough soft, if wheat ; 
and stiff, if rye. 

349. Sponge Bread. 
Take, for four loaves of bread, three quarts of wheat flour, 
and three of boiling water ; mix them thoroughly, and let 
the mixture remain till lukewarm ; then add twelve spoon- 
fuls of fanlily yeast, or six of brewer's ; place it where 
warm, to rise. When light, knead in flour to make it suffi- 
ciently stiff to mould up. Let it stand for a second rising, 
then mould it. 

350. R7je Bread. 

Wet the flour with lukewarm milk, (water will do, but it 
is not so good,) putting in the same proportions of yeast as 
for wheat bread. Put in two teaspoonfuls of salt for four 
•or five loaves of bread ; and two spoonfuls of melted butter 
make it more tender. It should be kneaded more stiff" 
than wheat bread. When light, put it into pans without 
moulding it up ; and let it regain in them, before bakingj, 
about twenty minutes. 



BREAD. 127 



351. Broivn Bread. ^ 

Take equal quantities of Indian meal and rye flour; scald 
he meal ; when lukewarm, mix in the flour, adding yeast 
ind salt, and kneading as for other bread. Bake from two 
o three hours. A good substitute for Graham or dispcpsia 
)read. ' 

352. Indian Bread. 

Mix, as for a thick gruel, Indian meal and cold water , 
' tir the mixture into boiling water ; let it boil half an 
iour ; stir in a little salt ; take it from the fire ; let it re- 
lain till lukewarm ; and then stir in yeast and Indian meal 
ill of the consistency of common dough. When light, take 
t out into buttered pans ; let it remain a few minutes, ther 
take it about two hours and a half. 

353. Graham Bread. 

To be sure of having a good article, send good, clean 

vheat to mill ; have it ground rather coarsely, without 

)olting ; and keep the meal in a dry cool place. Sift it 

through a common hair sieve, before using it. This will 

sufiiciently separate the grosser particles. 

Take six quarts of this wheat meal, one teacup of good 
yeast, and six spoonfuls of molasses, and mix them with a 
pint of milkwarm water and a teaspoonful of salaeratus. 
Make a ]^o\e in the flour, and stir this mixture in the mid- 
dle of the meal till it is like batter. Then proceed as with 
fine flour. Make it, when light enough, into four loaves. 
Make your oven hotter than for common bread ; and bake 
about an hour and a half. It is an excellent article of diet 
for the dispeptic and the costive, and for sedentary persons, 
and for children. 

354. Com Meal Bread. 

Take a piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg ; rub it 
into a pint of com meal ; make it a batter with two eggs 
and some new milk ; add a spoonful of yeast, and set it by 
the fire an hour to rise ; butter little pans, and bake it. 



128 BREAD. 

355.' Batter Bread. 

Take six spoonfuls of flour and three of corn meal, with 
& little salt ; sift them, and make a thin batter with four 
eggs and a sufficient quantity of rich milk. Bake it in a 
quick oven, in little tin moulds. 

356. Mixed Bread. 

Put a teaspoonful of salt, and a spoonful of yeast into a 
quart of flour ; make it sufficiently sof^ with com meal 
gruel. When well risen, bake it in a mould. It is an ex- 
cellent bread for breakfast. Indifferent flour will rise bet- 
ter made with gruel than with fair water. 

357. Rice Bread. No. I. 

Boil six ounces of rice in a quart of water till dry and 
soft ; put it into two pounds of flour and mix it well ; add 
two teaspoonfuls of salt, two spoonfuls of yeast, and enough 
milk or water to make it of a proper consistency. Bake it 
in moulds, when well risen. ' 

358. Rice Bread. No. 2. 

Boil a pint of rice till soft ; mix it with two quarts of 
wheat or rice flour ; when cool, add six spoonfuls of yeast, 
a little salt, and milk to reduce it nearly to the -consistency 
of wheat dough. Bake it, when light, in small buttered 
pans. 

359. Potato Bread. * 

Boil thoroughly, and mash fine, mealy potatoes ; add salt 
and a very little butter ; rub them with twice their quantity 
of flour ; stir in your yeast, and wet up with lukewarm milk 
or water, till stiff enough to mould up. It will rise quick- 
er than common wh^at bread ; and it should be baked as 
soon as risen, for it soon sours. 

360. French RoUs. No. 1. 

Pour a quart of lukewarm milk to a quart of flour ; melt 
two ounces of butter, and add to it, with two eggs and a 
easpoonful of salt ; when cool, stir in six spoonfuls of 



BISCUIT. 129 

yeasty and flour till sufficiently stiff to mould up. Set it in a 
warm place. ^When light, mould it into small rolls ; lay 
them on flat, buttered tins, and let them remain twenty 
minutes before baking. > 

361. French Rolls, No. 2. 

To a quart of sifted flour, add two well-beaten eggs, half 
a pint of milk, a spoonful of yeast, and a little salt ; knead 
it well, and set it to rise ; next morning, work in an ounce 
of butter, mould the dough into small roUs, and bake. The 
top crust should be tender. 

362. Dnj Butter Biscuit. 

Take half a pound'of butter, two pounds of sifled flour, 
half a pint of milk, or cold water, and a teaspoonful of salt; 
cut the butter into the flour, and add the salt ; wet the flour 
to a stiff dough with the milk, or water, and mix it well 
with a knife ; strew flour over the paste board, and knead 
the dough well ; roll it out into a large thick sheet, and 
beat it hard and a long time, on both sides, with the rolling 
pin ; cut it out with a tin or cup, into small, round, thick 
cakes ; beat each cake on both sides with the pin ; prick 
the cakes with a fork, and put them in buttered pans, and 
bake them of a light brown in a slow oven. 

363. Butter Biscuit. 

Mix a teacup of melted butter with two-thirds of a pint 
of milk, (or water, which is not so good,) add a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, six spoonfuls of nailk'yeast, or other yeast, and 
stir in flour till sufficiently stiff to mould up. The addition 
of two eggs will improve the biscuit. Place the dough 
where warm ; when risen, mould it with the hand into 
small cakes, and place them on flat, buttered tins. Bake 
them, after standing half an hour. 

364. Buttermilk Biscuit. 

Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of salaeratus in a teacup of 
sour milk, mix it with a pint of buttermilk, and two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt ; stir in flour till sufficiently stiff for mould* 
12 



130 BISCUIT. 

ing op. Make them into small cakes, and bake them im- 
mediately. 

365. Milk Biscuit. 

Rub half a pound of butter into three and a half pounds 
of flour, and add half a pint of yeast ; let it stand five min- 
utes, then mix it pretty stiff with milk of natural warmth 
and knead it half an hour, and then bake. 

366. Wainwood Biscuit, 

Take a quart of new milk, half a pint of good yeast, and 
a teacup- of molasses, and stir in dour enough to make a 
stiff sponge ; let it rise till very light ; then melt three 
quarters of a pound of butter, and work it into the sponge, 
adding flour till quite stiflf. Work it thoroughly, mould it 
to your liking, and put the biscuits on tin sheets to rise» 
while the oven is heating. 

367. Hard Biscuit. 
Take four pounds of flour ; rub three pounds and a half 
of it with a quarter of butter, four well-beaten eggs, and two 
teaspoonfuls of salt ; moisten it with mUk, pound it out thin 
with a rolling pin, and sprinkle a little of the reserved flour 
lightly over it. Roll it up and pound it out again, and 
sprinkle on more flour. Continue to repeat this operation 
till you work in all the reserved flour ; then roll it cmt thin, 
cut it into cakes with a tumbler, lay them on flat, buttered, 
tins, and cover them with a damp cteth to prevent their 
drying. Bake them in a quick oven. 

368. Sahsratus Biscuit. 

Put two teaspoonfuls of salaeratus to a pint of sour milL 
If you have no sour milk, put a spoonful of vinegar to a 
pint of sweet milk, and set it in a warm place. As soon 
as the milk curdles, mix it with the salaeratus, put in two 
spoonfuls of melted butter, and flour to makp stiff enough to 
roll out. Mould into small biscuit, and bake immediately 

369. Sponge Biscuit. 

Mix with a pint of lukewarm milk, half a teacup of 
melted butter, three spoonfuls of brewer's yeast, and a tea- 



hot"ake8. 131 

spoonful of salt, and flour till it becomes a very stiff batter. 
When light, drop the ndxture by spoonfuls, on buttered, flat, 
tins, several inches apart. After remaining a few min- 
utes, bake them, till of a light brown, in a quick oven. 

'370. Potato Biscuit, 

To four good sized, mealy potatoes, boiled soft, peeled, 
'and mashed, add a piece of butter as big as a hen's egg^ and 
a teaspoonful of salt. When the butter is melted, put in 
half a pint of cold milk. If the milk sufficiently cools the 
potatoes, put in a gill of yeast, and flour enough to make 
them of a right consistency to mould up. Place them where 
warm ; when risen, mould them up with the hand ; let them 
remain ten "or fifteen minutes, and bake. 

371. Cracker Sk 

Rub six ounces of butter into two pounds of flour ; dis- 
solve two teaspoonfuls of salaeratus in a wineglass of milk, 
and strain it on the flour ; add a teaspoonful of salt, and 
milk suflicient to roll it out. Beat it with a rolling pin for 
half an hour, pounding it out thin ; cut it into cakes with a 
tumbler ; bake them about fifteen minutes, and then take 
them out of the oven. When the rest of your things are 
baked enough, take them out, set in the crackers again, and 
let them remain till baked hard and crispy. 

372. Economy Cakes, 

Bread that has been rusked, or that is old and sour, can 
be made into good cakes. Cut the bread into small pieces, 
and soak it till very soft, in cold water ; drain off the water; 
and mash the bread fine. To three pints of the pulp add 
two well-beaten eggs, three or four spoonfuls of flour, and 
a little salt. Dissolve a teaspoonful of salsratus to a tea 
cup of milk, strain, and stir it into the bread. Add milk 
till the batter is of a consistency little thicker than for buck 
wheat cakes, and fry it in the same manner. 

Another way, which is very good. Mix a tumbler ot 
wheat flour with two spoonfuls of yeast, and suflicient cold 
water, or milk, to make it a thick batter. When light, 
mix the batter with tlie breads reduced to a pulp, adding a 



132 HOT cfKES. 

little salt, and a teaspoonful of salseratus dissolved in a litU« 
milk. Fry them in just sufficient fat to prevent their stick 
ing to the pan. 

373. Buckwheat Cakes, 

Mix a quart of buckwheat flour with a pint of lukewarm 
milk, or water, and twelve spoonfuls of yeast, and set it in 
a warm place to rise. When light, which will be in eight- 
or ten hours, or sooner if brewer's yeast is used, add a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and if sour, a teaspoonful of salaeratus dis- 
solved in a little niilk and strained. If too thick, thin them 
with cold milk and water. Fry them in just sufficient fat 
to prevent their sticking to the frying pan. 

374. Green Com Cakes. 

Take a pint of grated green corn, three spoonfuls of milk, 
and a teacup of flour; mix with them, half a teacup of 
melted butter, an egg^ a teaspoonful of salt, and half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper. Drop into hot butter, by the spoonful, 
and let the cakes fry eight or ten minutes. These cakes 
are nice served up with meat for diimer. 

375. Indian Com Cakes. 

Mix a quart of Indian meal with a handful of wheat-flour, 
stir into a quart of warmed milk, a teaspoonful of salt, and 
two spoonfuls of yeast ; stir, alternately into the milk, the 
meal and three well-beaten eggs ; when light, bake as buck- 
wheat cakes on a griddle, send them to the table hot. 
Should the batter sour, stir in a little salaeratus dissolved in 
Juke-warm water, letting it set half an hour before baking. 

376. Indian Slap Jacks, 

Take and scald a quart of Indian meal, in milk, if you 
have it — ^water will do, turn it out, and stir in half a pint 
of flour, half a pint of yeast, and a little salt. Fry them, 
when light, in just fat sufficient to keep them from sticking 
to the frying pan. 

Another nice way. Turn a quart of boiling milk or wa* 
ter to a pint of Indian meal, stir in three spoonfuls of flour 
liree eggs, and two teaspoonfuls of salt. 



HOT CAKES. 188 

377. Journey or Johnny Cakes, 

Sift and scald a quart of Indian meal with water enough 
to make a very thick batter ; add two or three teaspoonfuls 
of salt, and mould it into small cakes with the ha^ds. In 
moulding up, the hands will need a good deal of flouring to - 
prevent their sticking. Fry them in nearly sufficient fat to 
cover them. When brown on the under side, turn them. 
Cook them about twenty minutes. When done, split and 
butter them. 
• Another way, which is nice. Put to a quart of scalded ^ 
Indian meal a teaspoonful of salt, the same of salseratus 
dissolved in milk, adding two or three spoonfuls of wheat 
flour. Drop the batter by spoonfuls into the frying pan. 
The batter should be very thick, and there should be just 
fat sufficient to prevent the cakes sticking to the frying pan. 

378, Hoe Cakes, 
Scald a quart of Indian meal with just sufficient water to "^ 
make a thick batter ; stir in two spoonfuls of butter, and 
two teaspoonfuls of salt. Turn it into a buttered cake pan 
and bake about half an hour. 

379. Muffins, 

Take a quart of wheat flour, mix it smoothly with a pint 
and a half of lukewarm milk, half a teacup of yeast, two 
eggs, a teaspoonful of salt, and two spoonfuls of lukewarm 
melted butter. Place the batter where warm to rise. When 
light, butter your muffin cups, pour in the mixture, and bake 
it till of a light brown. 

380. Qttick Waffles. 

Take cold milk, and mix it with enough flour to make a 
thick batter. Add to a quart of the flour, six eggs, a spoon- 
ful of melted butter, and a teaspoonful of salt — some add 
half a nutmeg and four ounces of sugar. Bake immediately. 

381. Raised Flour Waffles, 

Stir into a quart of flour enough lukewarm milk to make 
a stiff batter — stir it in gradually, to prevent its being lumpy ; 
12* 



i84 HOT CAKB8. 

add two eggs, a spoonful of melted butter, lialf a teacup of 
yeast, and a teaspoonful of salt. Fill your waffle irons with 
the batter, when risen, and bake on a hot bed of coals. 
Turn the waffle irons over, when they have been on the 
fire between two and three minutes. They are done 
enough when brown on both sides. The waffle irons 
should be very hot, and well oiled with lard, before each 
cake is put in. The cakes should be buttered as quick as 
cooked. Serve them up with fine white sugar and ciimamon. 

382. Waffles. 

Take half a pint of cream and half a pint of milk, slightly 
warm, add six eggs, and stir in gradually a pound and a 
half of sifled (lour. 

383. Rice Waffles. 

Varm a teacup and a half of boiled rice* with a pint of 
milk, mix it smooth, and take it from the fire ; then stir in 
a pint of cold milk and a teaspoonful of salt; add four well- 
beaten eggs, and, gradually, fiour enough to make a thick 
batter. 

384. Breakfast Riqe Cakes. 

Put half a pound of rice to soak over night ; boil it very 
soft in the morning, drain oflf the water, mix it with four 
ounces of melted butter, and set it away to cool. When 
cold, stir it into a quart of niilk, adding a little salt ; then 
stir in, alternately six eggs and half a pint of sifted flour. 
Beat all well together, and bake on the griddle in cakes 
about the size of a small dessert plate. Butter and send 
them to the table, hot. 

Instead of preparing the rice, cold boiled rice makes very 
nice cakes, mixed and cooked as the prepared. 

385. Wafers. 

To the whites of twelve eggs add a pint of flour, two 
ounces of melted butter, and enough milk to make a thin 
batter, adding fine loaf sugar to the taste. Pour into the 
wafer irons, bake quickly without browning, and roll them 
while hot. 



TftlFLES, SLIP, CURBS AND WnST. 135 



386. Rice Wafers, 

Mix four ounces of melted butter with a pound of rico 
flour, a teaspoonful of salt, and a glass of wine ; stir in four 
well-beaten eggs, and just sufficient milk for easy rolling 
out ; roll out as thin as possible, cut into cakes with a wine- 
glass, and bake on buttered tins, in a moderate oven. 

387^ Rice Ruffs, 

Turn sufficient boiling milk, or water, to a pint of rice 
flour to make a thick batter ; when cold, add four well- 
beaten eggs, and a teaspoonful of salt. Drop it by spoon- 
fuls into hot fat. 

388. Rice Cakes. 

Stir a pint of rice, boiled soft, into a pint of milk, with a 
teaspoonful of salt, and three well-beaten eggs ; mix with 
wheat or rice flour till stiff enough to fry. If you prefer 
them baked, add two more eggs, and sufficient flour for roll- 
ing out, and cut them into cakes. 

389. Crumpets. 

With the hand, work into three teacups of raised dough, 
half a teacup of melted butter, three eggs, and only suffi- 
cient milk to leave it a thick batter ; pour it into a buttered 
pan, let it remain a quarter of an hour, then put on the bake 
pan and heat it so as to scorch flour. Bake half an hour. 

390. Cream Cakes. 

Take a tumbler of milk, a tumbler of thick cream, and 
four eggs, and stir in just sufficient flour to make them stiff 
enough to drop on buttered tins. Drop by spoonfuls, seve- 
ral inches apart, and bake in a quick oven. 

391. Syllabub. 
Season some milk with sugar and white wine, but not 
enough to curdle it; fill your glasses nearly full, then crown 
them with seasoned whipt cream 



136 TJUFLSSy SLIP, CURDS IKP WHET. 

392. Floating Island. 

Take six whites of eggs, six spoonfuls of jelly, and a 
pint of cream sweetened with loaf sugar; beat &e jelly and 
the whites of the eggs together till they form a stiff froth 
ihat stands alone. Have the cream ready in a broad, shal« 
low dish. Just before sending to the table, pile up the froth 
in the centre of the cream. Some beat with the jelly and 
eggs, wine, the juice of lemon, rose-water, and essence of 
lemon. 

393. Flummery, 

Put sponge or savoy cakes in a deep dish and turn on 
white wine enough to make them quite moist. Make a 
rich boiled custard, using the yolks of the eggs only ; when 
cool, turn it over the cakes. Beat the whites of the eggs 
to a froth, and turn them over the whole. 

394. Whip Syllabub. 

Take nice sweet cream, to each pint, put six ounces of 
double refined powdered white sugar, the juice and grated 
rind of a lemon, and half a tumbler of white wine i beat the 
whole well together, put jelly in glasses, and cover them 
as fast as it rises. 

395. Ornamental Froth for Blanc Mange, or Creams. 
Beat to a froth the whites of four eggs, and then stir in 
half a pound of preserved raspberries, cranberries, or straw- 
berries ; beat the whole well together, and turn it over the 
top of your blanc mange or creams. 

396. Virginia Floating Island, 

Fill your bowl nearly with syllabub, beat the whites of 
six new-laid eggs to a stiff froth, mix with it raspberry or 
strawberry marmalade enough to color and flavor it, lay the 
froth lightly on the syllabub, first putting in some slices of 
cake ; raise it in little mounds and garnish with something 
.ight. 

397. Charlotte Rousse. 

Take an ounce of isinglass, quite fine, dissolve it in a 
coifeocup of water, and let it simmer slowly until it is re- 



TRIFLES, SLIP, CURDS AND WHEY. 137 

duccd to less than a quarter. Next take a stick of vanilla 
and put it in a cup and a half of milk, sweeten it to your 
taste, and let it boil slowly fifteen minutes. Then take the 
yolks of four eggs, beat them a little, and when the milk is 
so cooled that it will not cook the eggs, stir them carefidly 
in. Put the milk again over the fire, and the eggs ; keep 
gtining till thick, (it must on no account boil,) &en put it 
through a sieve. Put the isinglass through too, but keep 
them separate. Cover the bottom and sides of your mould 
with finger biscuits, neatly fitted into each other, and set 
the mould in a pail of ice. Beat a pint of cream, and mix 
all together, milk, isinglass, and cream, and pour it into the 
mould; cover the mould and lay ice over it, and leave it in 
the ice three hours. The cream should be beaten just be- 
fore you are ready to put it into the ice. , 

398. Apple Snow. 
Put twelve good tart apples in cold water, and ^et them 
over a slow fire ; when soft, drain ofif the water, strip the 
skins ofif the apples, core them, and lay them in a deep 
dish. Beat^the whites of twelve eggs to a stiflT froth ; put 
half a pound of powdered white sugar to the apples, beat - 
them to a stiff froth, and add the beaten eggs. Beat the 
whole to a stiff snow, then turn it into a dessert dish, and 
ornament it with myrtle or box. 

399. Trifle, 

Put* slices of sponge cake, or nice rolls, at the bottom of 
a deep dish, wet them with white wine, and fill the dish 
nearly to the top with rich boiled custard ; season half a 
pint of cream with white wine and sugar, and beat it to a 
froth ; as it rises, take it lightly off and lay it on the cus- 
tard, piling it up high and tastily, and decorate it with pre- 
serves of any kind cut so thin as not to bear the froth down 
by their weight. 

400. Slip. 

Make a quart of rich milk a Uttle warm, stir into it about 
a spoonful of prepared rennet, and when cold it will be of 
the consistence of jelly. Make it but a few hours before 
using. By standing it becomes tough and watery. In 



ft 



138 BLANC MANGES. 

fummofy set the dish in ice afler it has jellied. Eat it with 
powdered .sugar, cream, and nutmeg. 

401. Curds and Whey, 

Turn a quart of milk to a jelly, as for slip, let it stand till 
just before it is to be served, then take it up with a skimmer 
and lay it on a sieve. When the whey has drained off, 
dish the curds, and surround them with cream. Use nut- 
meg, sugar, and wine. Very delicious, easily prepared, 
and cheap. The whey drained from the curds is an ex- 
cellent drink for invalids. 

402. Isinglass Blanc Mange. 

Take an ounce of mild, white, isinglass, pull it into small 
pieces, rinse, and put them to a quart of milk, if the weather 
be hot ; to three pints, if it be cold ; set the milk on a few 
coals, stir it constantly till the isinglass is dissolved, 
sweeten it to the taste, with double refined loaf sugar, put 
in a piece of ciimamon, and a blade of mace, or a vanilla 
bean. Boil it five or six minutes, stirring constantly. 
Strain it, and fill the moulds with it, and let it remain in 
them till cold. One bean may be used several times. Al- 
monds, grated lemon rind, wine, and rose-water, may be 
added with the other ingredients, if liked. 

403. Blanc Mange. 

Take four calf's feet, a pint and a half of thick cream, 
half a pound of crushed loaf sugar, a glass of wine, half a 
glass of rose-water, and a teaspoonful of sifted mace ; boil 
the feet, afler thoroughly cleansed, (such as have not been 
skinned,) till all the meat drops off the bone. Drain the 
liquor through a colander or sieve, and skim it well ; let it 
stand till next morning to congeal ; then clean it well from 
the sediment, and put it into a tin or bell-metal kettle. Stir 
into it, the mace, sugar, and the cream, having been first 
boiled with a handful of peach leaves, or an ounce of broken 
bitter almonds ; boil hard five minutes, repeatedly stirring 
it. Strain it tlirough a linen cloth into a large bowl, and 
add the wine and rose-water. Set it in a cool place for 
three or four hours, stirring often to prevent the cream from

separatiDg from the jelly. Stir till cold — the more the bet- 
ter. Wash, wipe dry, and then wet your moulds in cold 
water, and put in the blanc mange when it becomes very 
thick. After it has set in the moulds to be quite firm, loosen 
it carefully all round with a knife, and turn it out on glass 
plates. If you wish to make it with almonds, take an 
ounce of blanched bitter almonds and two ounces of sweet, 
pound them with rose-water, add them gradually, when the 
mixture is ready to boil, or while cooling in the bowl, stir- 
ring them well in. If it inclines to stick to the moulds, set 
them for an instant in hot water. 



404. Calfs Feet Blanc Mange, ' 

Boil four feet in iive quarts of water till reduced to one 
quart ; strain and let it cool ; put it into a quart of milk and 
boil it eight or ten minutes, sweetening it to the taste ; strain 
it, and fill your moulds. Flavor with cinnamon and lemon 
peel before boiling, or with peach leaves or rose-water 
after boilin

405. Moss Blanc Mange, 

ree sprigs of moss well washed, put it in one 
quart of cold water, over the fire ; let it remain till scalding 
hot,' (to extract the bitter taste,) then squeeze it dry, put it 
in a quart of cold milk, boil the. milk half an hour, then 
strain it through a fine sieve ; season it with white sugar, 
white wine, and essence of lemon, and. turn it into the 
moulds to cool. 

406. Rice Flour Blanc Mange, 

Mix four spoonfuls of ground rice, very smooth, with a 
tumbler of cold milk, and stir it into a quart of boiling milk ; 
add the grated rind of a lemon, hsML the juice, a blade of 
mace, and sweetening, to the taste. Boil all six or eight 
minutes, stirring it frequently. Set it from the fire. When 
cool, add the beaten whites of three eggs, put it again on 
the fire, stir it constantly till nearly boiling hot, turn it into 
deep cups or moulds, and let it remain till cold. It is nice 
for invalids.

407. Ice Cream. See No. 3€8, 
Take a quart of rich cream boiled and set away till cold, 
tiulf a pound of loaf sugar powdered, the juice ol two X^.'^z^ 
lemons, or of a pint of raspberries or strawberries, or an 
ounce of bitter almonds blanched and pounded with rose- 
water. Put the cream into a broad pan, then stir into it the 
sugar by degrees, t;ll well mixed, and strain it through a 
sieve. Put it into a tin that has a close cover, and set the 
tin ill a tub; fill the tub with ice broken in very small 
pieces, and strew among the ice a large quantity of salt, 
being careful that none of the salt get into the cream. 
Scrape the cream down with a spoon as it freezes: round 
the edges of the tin. While the cream is freezing, stir t 
gradually the lemon juice or the juice of a pint of mashed 
strawberries. When it is all frozen, dip the tin in luke- 
warm water ; take out the cream and fill your glasses jusi 
as ready to use it. It will soon melt. Essence of lemon, 
and the juice of pine apples, are nice to flavor the cream. 

408. Ice Cream without Cream, See No. 308. 

Where cream cannot be procured, a custard made in the 
following manner may be substituted : — To a quart of milk, 
add the beaten yolks of four eggs and a vanilla bean or the 
rind of a lemon ; set it on a few coals, making it very sweet 
with white sugar ; stir it constantly till scalding hot, but do 
«ot let it boil. Remove it from the fire, and take out the 
lemon peel or bean. When perfectly cold, put it in an ice 
«ream form — if you have none, a milk kettle with a tight 
cover may be substituted. Set the form into the centre of 
a tub that is large enough to leave a space of five inches 
Trom the form to the outside of the tub ; fill the space round 
the form with alternate layers of finely cracked ice and 
rock salt, having a layer of ice last, and the whole just as 
high as the form. The tub should be covered with a wool- 
en cloth while the cream is freezing, and the form should 
be constantly shaken. If you wish to shape the cream, 
pour it into moulds as soon as it freezes, set them in the 
tub, et them remain till just before they are to be eaten, 
then dip them in warm water, and take them immediately 
ont,^and turn them into dessert dishes.

410. Vanilla Cream. 

Boil a Vanilla bean in a quart of rich milk until suffi- 
ciently flavored ; take it out, mix with the milk eight well* 
beaten eggs, and boil it a little longer, making it very sweet,

420. To Ornament Creams or Custards, 

Take the whites of two eggs, and two spoonfuls of rasp- 
berry, or red currant sirup, or jelly, and whisk them to- 
gether one hour. Lay the froth in any form upon a cream 
or custard, piled up to imitate rock. It may be served in a 
dish by itself, with cream around it. |** 

421. White Lemon Cream, 

Boil the thin peel of two lemons in a pint of cream, strain 
and thicken it with the wsU-beaten yolks of three, and 
the whites of four, eggs ; oweeten with powdered loaf su- 
gar, stir till nearly cold, and put it in glasses. 

422. Lemonade Ice. 

Wiih a quart of rich lemonade, mix the well-beaten 
whites of six fresh eggs, and freeze it. 

The juice of Morello cherries, or of ourrants, mixed with 
sugar and water, and prepared in the same way, makes 
very delicate ices. 

423. Vegetables. 

As a general rule, add a little salt to the water in which 
you cook your vegetables, with the exception of dried beans 
and peas. 

424. Potatoes. 

The easiest way to cook Irish potatoes, is to put them in 
just enough boiling water to cover them, with the skins on, 
and to boil them constantly till done. It is the best way ; • 
and then to send them hot to the table with the skins on, 
or at that moment taken off. A plain boiled or roasted po- 
tato, when well cooked, is best and most healthful. You 
thus get the grateful flavor of the potato. Potatoes should 
not lie soaking in the water without boiling, if you wish 
them mealy. 

JSome cooks say, pare and put them in a pot, with jus'^ 
boiling water enough to prevent their burning, and a little 
salt ; cover them tight, and boil them till you can easily 
stick a fork through them ; and if any water remains, turn 



144 Vegetables. 

it off, and put the pot where it will keep moderately warm 
and let the potatoes steam, with the lid off, a few minutes ; 
then dish them, covering them with a cloth. Old and poor 
potatoes are best boiled till soft, and then peeled and mashed 
fine, with a little butter, salt, and cream or milk added, and 
then put into a dish, smoothed over with a knife, a little 
flour sprinkled over, and set where they will brown. Cold 
prepared, or whole boiled potatoes, are nice sliced, and fried 
wi^ just sufficient butter or lard to prevent their burning. 
When brown on both sides, take them up, and salt and 
butter them. Most potatoes will boil in half an hour ; new 
ones in less time. Some cooks say, put your potatoes into 
cold water to boil them, and neither cover them while boil- 
ing, nor after they are dished. As common a vegetable as 
is the potato, no two cooks are agreed in the best manner 
of cooking it. The best and only satisfactory receipt is : 
suit your own taste. 

425. Potato Snow Balls, 

After boiled tender, drain off the water, and let the pota- 
toes steam till they break to pieces ; take them up, put two 
or three at a time compactly together in a strong cloth, and 
press them tight into a ball, and lay them on a gridiron to 
broil till of a light brown. Or, mix prepared potatoes with 
the yolk of an egg, roll them into balls, flour them or cover 
them with egg and bread crums ; fry them in good drip- 
pings, or brown them in an oven« 

426. Fried Potatoes, Apples, and Onions. 

Fry brown a few pieces of salt pork, and take them up. 
Put into the fat, or part of it, raw peeled potatoes sliced 
very thin, first lying half an hour in ice-water, and fry them 
till brown, occasionally stirring them. Fry sliced pleasant 
tart apples, and onions, in the same manner. Thus pi-o- 
pared, they make a cheap, plain, and good dish. The pota- 
toes maybe cut in shavings, like apple-parings, if preferred. 

427. Roast Potatoes. 
Take potatoes of the same size, wash and dry them, pat 
them in a tin Dutch oven or some convenient toaster ; do 
not burn the outside before they are wanned through. 



VEGETABLES. 145 

Roast large ones about two hours. They will roast quicker 
if first parboiled. 

428. To Roast Potatoes under Meat. 

Pare raw potatoes and salt them ; put them in your drip- 
ping pan around your meat, and now and then turn them. 

t 
429. Potato Croquettes. ^ 

Take four large mealy potatoes boiled and peeled^^half 
their weight of butter and of pounded loaf sugar, two eggs 
beaten, half the grated peel of a lemon, and a little salt ; 
pound the potatoes in a mortar with the other ingredients, 
beat the yolk of four eggs, roll up the croquettes, dip them 
in the beaten eggs, and roll them in sifted bread crums ; 
in an hour roll them again, and fry them in butter. 

430. Sweet Potatoes. 

Take such as are of the same size, wash but do not pe^ 
them ; boil tender, drain off the water, and put them on tin 
sheets in a stove till of a light brown. Or, cut them cross- 
wise without peeling, in slices half an inch thick ; broil 
them on a griddle, and serve them with drawn butter. 

431. Turnips. 

Take such turnips as are white and smooth, and scrape 
them lightly, but thoroughly, rinsing them in cold water ; 
put them into boiling water with a Uttle salt, and continue 
the boiling about ten minutes, or until you can easily force 
a fork into them. Carry them ikistantty from the pot to the 
table very hot, with drawn butter. For mashing, turnips 
may want a very little more boiling, and perhaps paring. 
Cook them perfectly tender, squeeze them quite dry, mash 
them very smooth, butter, salt, and pepper them* 

Yellow turnips require longer coolung than white ones 
If very laige, split them in two. 

432. Ragout of Turnips. 

Prepare, as for boiling, turnips sufficient to fill ft dish j 
put them into a stew pan, with a little butter, salt aikd 
sugar ; set them over a hot stove ; shake and turn them tiH

of a good brown ; add half a pint of rich gravy, stew them 
till tender, and serve fhem with the added gravy. 

433. Beets. 

To rightly prepare beets for boiling — do not spoil them 
by over-preparing them — neither cut nor scrape them. By 
bleeding they become insipid ; only wash them. Boil them 
till tender ; in summer one hour, in winter three. The 
tops, when tender, are good to boil for greens. Boiled 
beets are nice, sliced into cold spiced vinegar, after remain- 
ing in it a few days, 

434. Parsnips and Carrots, 

If large, after washing split them in two ; lay them in a 
stew pan with the flat side down, and turn on boiling water 
enough to cover them. Boil till tender, or till you can 
easily thrust a fork through them ; take up, skin and butter 
them. 

435. Onions, 

Peel and put them into boiHng milk and water — (water 
alone will do, but it is not so good.) When tender, take 
up and salt them, and turn a litSe melted butter over them. 

436. Boiled Sweet Com. 

Boil corn on the cob, if you wish it sweet. Boil it, cut 
off the cob, with Lima beans, for succotash ; boil it from fif- 
teen to thirty minutes, according to its age. 

437. Fried Sweet Com, 

Cut tender com off the cob. ^ Put it in a pan, and add 
sufficient water to moisten it, a little salt and butter, and fry 
to the liking. 

438. Beans of Various Kinds. 
Take the strings off French or striped beans, and if old, 
cut off the edges, and cut through the middle of the beans 
iMU^thwise. Boil them with a little salt from twenty-five 
to lorty-five minutes. A little salaeratus boiled with them 
Biakes them more healthful, and preserves their green color. 



VEGETABLES. 147 

Lima beans can be kept twelve months. When fresh gath- 
ered, dry them thoroughly in the pod ; or without drying, 
pack them in a barrel with alternate layers of salt, having 
a layer of salt at the bottom. Cover them quite tight, first 
la3dng a weight on them to press them compact. Keep 
them in a cool dry place. Snaps can be kept in the same 
way. When used, wash the pods, lay them all night in 
fresh water, shell them in the morning, and keep them in 
water till ready to boil them. Put them up as late in the 
season as possible. 

439. Boston Baked Beans. 

Take two quarts of middling sized white beans, three 
pounds of salt pork, and one spoonful of molasses. Pick 
the beans over carefully, wash and turn about a gallon of 
soft water to them in a pot ; let them soak in it lukewarm 
over night ; set them in the morning where they will boil 
till the skin is very tender and about to break,'adding a tea- 
spoonful of salaeratus. Take them up dry, put them in 
your dish, stir in hie molasses, gash the pork, and put it 
down in the dish so as to have the beans cover all but the 
upper surface ; turn in cold water till the top is just cov- 
ered ; bake and let the beans remain in the oven all night. 

Beans are good prepared as for baking, made a little 
thinner, and then boiled several hours with the pork. 

440. Artichokes. 

Scrape and put them in boiling water, with a spoonful of 
salt to two dozen. In about two hours, or when boiled ten- 
der, take them up,^alt and butter each one. 

441. Baked Squash. 

Cut " Butter Squash " in long strips an inch and a half 
thick, and bake it half an hour in buttered tins. 

442. Boiled Squash. 

Boil summer squashes whole, if very tender ; If not, pare, 
quarter, and seed them. When boiled very tender, take 
them up, put them in a strong cloth, press out all the water, 
mash them quite smooth, salt and butter them to your taste 



148 VB0BTABLE8. 

Of a winter squash the neck part is best. Cut it in pieces, 
take off the rind, tient in a cloth, boil in salt and water til] 
lender, press out the water, chop it in a bowl till smooth 
with a trencher, (the same for summer squash,) salt and 
butter it. 

443. Squashes or Cymlings. 

Prepare and boil as for " Squash " ; then put them in 

a colander, drain off the water till quite dry, rub them with 

a wooden spoon through the colander, put them in a stew 

. pan with a cup of cream, a piece of butter, pepper and salt, 

and stew them till very dry. 

444. Greens. 

Turnip tops, white mustard, dock, spinach, water-cresses, 
dandelions, cabbage-plants, the roots and tops of young 
beets, all make nice greens. Boil them, adding a little sal- 
sratus and salt to the' water. If not fresh and plump, soak 
them half an hour in salt and water before cooking. When 
boiled enough they will sink to the bottom of the pot. 

445. Asparagtis. 

Cut off and reject the white part of the stalks ; cut the 
lower part of the stalks in thin slices, if tough, and boil 
them eight or ten minutes before putting in the tops. Lay 
the tops compactly together, tie them in small bundles, and 
boil from twelve to twenty-five minutes, putting in the 
water a little salt, and a quarter of a spoonful of salaeratus 
to retain their fresh green color, to two or three quarts of 
water. Just before done, toast a slice of bread, moisten it 
with some of the asparagus liquor, lay it in your dish, but- 
ter it, take up the asparagus carefully with a skimmer, lay 
it on the toast, remove the string, salt and turn a little drawn 
butter over the whole. Sea-kale is prepared and cooked 
in the same way. 

446. Salsify — Sautl^em mode. 

Scrape and wash the roots, put them into boiling water 
with a little salt. When sufficiently boiled, drain and place 
ihem in the dish without cutting them up. They are an 



VEGETABLES. 149 

«^cellent vegetable, but require nicety in cooking. Expo- 
sure to the air, either in scraping or after boiling, makes 
them black. 

447. Salsify or Vegetable Oyster. 

After scraping off the outside, parboil it, slice it, dip the 
slices into a beaten Qgg and fine bread crums, and fry in 
lard. It is very good boiled, and then stewed a few min- 
utes in milk, with a little salt and butter. Or, make a batter 
of wheat flour, milk, and eggs ; cut the salsify in thin slices, 
first boiling it tender ; put thera into the batter with a little 
salt ; drop the mixture into hot fat by spoonfuls. Cook 
them till of a light brown. 

448. Peas, 

Peas are best picked and shelled immediately before 
cooking. Put them in boiling water with a little salt and 
salaeratus, in the proportion of a quarter of a teaspoonful to 
half a peck of peas. Boil them from twenty to forty-five 
minutes. When perfectly tender, take them up with a 
skimn^r ; salt and butter them to the taste. 

449. Field Peas. 

Gather, prepare, and boil them the same as ''Peas"; 
then pour them into a colander ; put some butter or lard in 
a frying pan ; when it boils mash the peas, fry them till of 
a light thrown in a cake, and put it in a dish with the crust 
uppermost, and garnish with thin bits of fried bacon. They 
are very nice fried whole, so that each pea is distinct from 
the others. But they must b^ boiled less, and fried with 
great care. Plain boiling is a very common way of cook 
ing them. When dried, cook peas like dried beans. 

450. Cabbage and Cauliflotoets, 

Remove the loose leaves, quarter the stump end to the 
heart of the cabbage, wash and have it perfectly clean, and 
boil it from half an hour to an hour. If not boiled with 
salt meat, add a little salt ; a little salaeratus improves its 
color. White cauliflowers are the best. Take off the out- 
side leaves, let them he in cold water and salt half an hour, 



150 TBGBTABLE8. 

then boil them from fifteen to twenty-fiye minutes in milk 
and water, with a little salt, or in clear water. Keep the 
cabbage covered with water. It will ameliorate the flavor 
of old strong ones, to boil them in two waters. When half 
done, take tiiem out, and put them into a sauce pan of bcnl- 
ing water. 

451. Brocoli. 

The kind that bears flowers around the joints of the 
stalks, cut into convenient lengths for your dish ; scrape the 
skin from the stalk, and pick out such leaves and flowers 
as need rejection ; tie up in bunches, and boil and season 
it like asparagus. The brocoli that heads at the top like 
cauliflowers, must be treated like cauliflowers. 

452. Celeriac, 

This, though an excellent vegetable, seems to be but 
little known. The stalks of it can hardly be distinguished 
from celery : it is much easier cultivated. The roots are 
nice boiled tender, cut in thin slices, and used in soup or 
in meat pies. Or, scrape and cut them in slices, boil till 
very tender, drain ofl* the water, sprinkle on a little salt, 
turn in milk sufficient to cover them ; stew four or five 
minutei^^ turn into a dish, and give them a little butter. 

458. Pickled Eggs. See No. 463. 

Boil hard, remove the shells, let stand in weak brine 
2 or 3 days ; put in jar, and pour over them boiling vinegar 
seasoned with whole peppers, allspice and ground ginger 
When cold, close tight. Fit for use in a month. 

. 454. Southern Manner of Boiling Rice,^ • 

Pick over the rice, rinse . it repeatedly in cold water till 
perfectly clean ; then put it in a pot of boiling' water with 
a little salt, allowing a quart of water to a teacup of rice. 
Boil it seventeen minutes, drain off the water very close, 
set the pot over a few coals, and let it steam fifteen minutes 
with the lid off. The beauty of rice boiied in this way is, 
each kernel stands out by itself, while it is perfectly tender. 

lie very careful in the boiling and steaming, as a few 
n^ments variation in the time, may quite change its looks. 



VEGETABLES. 151 

The water should boil hard when the rice is put in, and 
not stop till turned off to have the rice steamed. The water 
the rice is boiled in makes good starch for muslin, if boiled 
a few minutes by itself. 

455. Egg Plant. 

Purple ones are best. Take young fresh ones, pull out 
the stem, parboil them to take out the bitter taste, cut them 
in slices an inch thick without peeling them, dip them in 
the yolk of an egg, and cover them with grated bread, and 
a Uttle salt and pepper ; when one side has dried, cover the 
other in the same way, then fry them a nice brown. They 
are very dehcious, tasting much lik^ soft crabs. The egg- 
plant may be dressed thus : parboil it after scraping off the 
rind ; cut a slit the whole length, and take out the seeds ; 
fill the space with a rich force-meat ; stew it in well-season- 
ed gravy, or bake and serve it up with gravy in the dish. 

456. Potato Pumpkin, 

Take one of a good color, seven or eight inches in diam- 
eter, cut a piece off the top, take out the seeds, wash and 
wipe the cavity, pare it, and fill the hollow with good force- 
meat. Put the top on, set it in a deep pan to protect the 
sides, bake it in a moderate oven, put it carefully in the 
dish without breaking, and it will look like a handsome 
mould. 

457. Cucumbers, 

To be salutary, they should be eaten within twenty-four 
hours after picked. Keep them in cold water, and fifteen 
or twenty minutes before eating them, pare and slice them 
into fresh cold water to take off the slimy matter. Just be- 
fore carryihg to the table, drain off all the water, put them 
in a deep dish, and sprinkle on a good deal of pepper and 
salt, and cover them with vinegar. Cucumbers are thought 
by many people to be very unhealthy ; but if properly pre- 
pared, they will not be found any more so than most other 
summer vegetables. 

To stew cucumbers, pare ten large cucumbers, cut them 
in thick slices, flour them well, and fry in butter ; then put 
them m a sauce pan with a teacup of gravy, and season 



162 VEGETABLES. 

with cayenne, salt, and catsup. Stew them an hour and 
serre them hot. 

458, Salads. 

To have this delicate dish in perfection, pick your lettuce, 
pepper-grass, chervil, cress, &c. early in the morning ; 
wash and lay it in cold water, if iced the better: just be- 
fore dinner, drain the water from your salad, cut it into a 
bowl, giving the proper proportions of each plant, and pre^ 
pare the following mixture. Boil two fresh eggs ten min- 
utes, put them in water to cool, then put the yolks in a 
soup-plate, turn on t][iem a spoonful of cold water, rub them 
with a wooden spoon till they are quite dissolved, and add 
two spoonfuls of oil. Mix it well, adding one teaspoonful 
of salt, one of powdered sugar, and one of made mustard. 
These all being mixed quite smooth, stir in two spoonfuls 
of tarragon vinegar, and two of common. Put it over the 
salad, and garnish the top with the whites of the eggs cut 
in rings, and lay around the edge of the bowl young scall- 
ions, they being the most delicate of the onion family. Some 
cooks say, if you have not salad oil, melt a little butter and 
put it in a separate dish ; if turned over the salad it will not 
be crispy. 

459. Stevoed Mushrooms. 

Gather such as are grown, but are young enough to have 
red gills ; cut off that part of the stem which grew in the 
earth, wash them carefully, and take the skin from the top ; 
put them in a stew pan with some salt, stew them till ten- 
der, thickening them with a spoonful of butter, mixed with 
one of brown flour. A little red wine may be added ; but 
the flavor of the mushroom is too delicious to require aid 
from any thing. 

460. Broiled Mushrooms. 

Prepare them as before directed : broil them on a griddle, 
and when done, sprinkle salt and pepper on the gills, and 
put a little butter on them. 

461. Tomatoes. 

If very ripe, tomatoes will readily skin ; if not, pour scald* 
Ing water on them, and let them remain in it four or five

i&inntes. Peel and put them in a stew pan with a spoon- 
ful of water, if not very juicy ; if so, no water will be 
required. Put in a little salt, stew them half an hour, and 
then turn them into a deep dish with buttered toast, or omit 
the toast, and add butter and pepper. Another way of 
cooking them, which is considered very nice by epicures, 
is to put them in a deep dish, with fine bread crums, or crack- 
ers pounded fine, a layer of each alternately ; put a little 
pepper and salt, and small bits of butter on each layer. 
Some cooks add a little nutmeg and sugar. Place a layer 
of bread crums on the top. Bake it forty-five minutes. 

462. Mustard. 

Young mustard is a very good vegetable, prepared and 
cooked like other *^ Greens." Ground mustard is best, 
fresh made. Mix it by degrees with fine salt ; rub them 
together till perfectly smooth, wetting up with a little milk, 
if it be eaten immediately ; or with hot water. 

463. Directions for Pickling. See No. 453. 

Take sharp cider vinegar for pickling, but not the very 
sharpest. Use brassf utensils, first thoroughly cleaning 
them, and suffer no vinegar to cool in them, as the rust 
formed by so doing is very poisonous. A good way is, to 
boil alum and salt in the vinegar, in the proportion of half 
a teacup of salt and a spoonful of alum, to three gallons of 
vinegar. But for the best-wsy of pickling cucumbers, see 
" Cucumbers." Keep pickles in a cool dry place, and either 
in glass, stone, or wooden vessels. If particular, use wide 
mouthed glass bottles, or stone jars, having corks which 
must be fitted in with linen, and covered with bladder or 
leather ; and for taking the pickles out and for returning 
them, using a small wooden spoon. It is essential to the 
beauty and excellence of the pickles, that they be always 
completely covered with vinegar. AH kinds of pickles 
should be stirred up occasionsJly ; the soft ones, if any, 
^should be taken out, the vinegar scalded, and turned back 
scalding hot. If very weak, throw it away, and take new 
vinegar. Whenever any scum rises, scald the vinegar. If 
you do not wish to have all your pickles spiced, keep a 

14 



IM TICKUUU 

•tone pot of spiced Tinegu by itself, and put in a few bom 
time to time, as you want spiced pickles. 

464. Cucumbers. 

Grather those that are small and green, and of a quick 
growth. Pour on them boiling hot strong brine, and let 
Uiem remain in it twenty-four hours ; take them out, let 
them dry, and put them into sharp vinegar. Repeat the 
same process daily, or as often as you wish to make addi- 
tions. The same brine maybe used several times, pouring 
it on each mess of cucumbers boiling hot, and letting 
them remain twenty-four hours before taking out, drying, 
and putting into the vinegar. When you have done pick- 
ling, scald the vinegar three days in succession, pouring it 
on the cucumbers boiling hot. If necessary add new 
vinegar. 

465. To pickle Cucumbers. 

Prepare the cucumbers by scalding them in brine ; put 
them into a mixture of one part whiskey and three parts 
water ; secure them closely. By Christmas they will be 
hard, of a fine flavor, and will retain their original color. 
The liquor will be excellent vinegar for the table. 

466. Tomatoes. 
Prick the skins of fair ripe tomatoes ; spread them in 
layers, and on each layer put pounded mace, cloves, and 
cinnamon, and pour cold vinegar over the whole. The 
vinegar from tomatoes thus prepared, is preferable to 
catsup. 

467. Mangoes. 

Take green muskmelons as late in the season as possi- 
ble, cut a small piece from the side that lay next the ground, 
and take out the seeds. If the citron or nutmeg melons are 
used for mangoes, scrape off the rough part. The long 
common muskmelons are best. Soak the melons in salt 
and water three or four days ; take them out, sprinkle the 
inside with powdered cloves, pepper and nutmeg ; fill them 
with fine strips of horseradish, cinnamon, and small string 
beans. Nasturtions and radish tops are also nice. Fill the 



PICKLK8 166 

cre^ces witb American mustard seed. Put back the piece 
of melon tliat was cut off, and bind the melon up tight with 
^hite cotton cloth, sewing it on. Place the melons the 
covered side up, in a stone jar. Boil alum and salt in vin- 
egar in the proportion of six spoonful^ of salt and one of 
alum, to three gallons of vinegar, adding peppercorns to the 
liking, and pour the vinegar, scalding hot, on the melons. 
Barberries, or radish tops, pickled in bunches, are a nice 
garnish for mangoes. The barberries preserve their natural 
color best by being first dried. Whenever wanted for use, 
turn boiling vinegar over them, and let them lay several 
hours to swell. Pickle mangoes like ** Cucumbers." 

468. Butternuts. 

Pick your butternuts about the fourth of July, or not so 
late but what a pin can readily be put through them ; lay 
them in salt and water ten days, changing the water every 
day ; then rub off their coat with a coarse rough cloth. 
For one hundred nuts make a pickle of two quarts of vin- 
egar, one ounce of pulverized pepper, one of ginger, half an 
ounce of mace, half of cloves, hsdf of nutmegs, and a spoon- 
full of mustard seed. Put the spices in a thin muslin bag, 
lay it in the vinegar with the nuts, and boil all a few min- 
utes, then set them away. 

469. Walnuts. 

Gather your nuts in July, put them in a strong brine nine 
days, changing them every other day ; take them out, wipe 
them dqr with a woolen cloth, put them in cold vinegar and 
salt six weeks, then make your pickle of mace, cloves, nut- 
• megs, whole pepper, race ginger, garlic, shallots, bruised 
mustard seed, and horseradish-^let it be very strong. Boil 
it, and when cold, turning off the old vinegar from the nuts, 
pour on the new — stop tight. 

470. Cabbage. 

Take purple cabbages for pickling. Strip off the loose 
leaves, quarter them, put them in a keg, sprinkle a great 
deal of salt on each, and let them ren^ain all but a week. 

To a gallon of vinegar, add an ounce of mace, and one 
of peppercorns and cinnamon. Cloves and allspice improve 



J 56 PICKLES. 

the taste, but darken the color of the cabbages. Add a 
little alum to the vinegar, and pour it boiling hot on the 
cabbages, letting the salt remain. Repeat the boiling of 
the vinegar, and turning it on the cabbages six or seven 
times every two or three days, to make them tender. 

471. Cabbages and Cauliflowers. 

Slice red cabbage into a colander, and sprinkle each 
layer with salt ; let it drain two days, then put it into a jar, 
and cover it with boiling vinegar, adding a few slices of red 
beet. Spices may be boiled in the vinegar to the taste. 
Caidiflowers, cut into bunches and thrown in after being 
salted, will have a beautiful red. 

472. Peppers. 

Take such as are fresh and green ; cut a small slit in 
them ; take the seeds out carefully and neatly with a small 
knife ; and wash them. Pour weak boiling brine over 
them, and let them stand four days, renewing the brine daily 
boiling hot. Chop cabbage fine; season it highly with 
cinnamon, mace and cloves ; and stuff the peppers, adding 
nasturtions if liked. Sew them up nicely ; aud turn the 
same sharp vinegar boiling hot over them, three successive 
weeks, adding a little alum the last 

Tomatoes, if green and small, are good pickled with the 
peppers. 

473. East India Pickle. 

Chop cabbage fine, leaving out the stalks, with three 
onions, a horseradish root, and two green peppers to each 
cabbage. Soak all in salt and water three or four days. 
Season vinegar very highly with mace, cloves, cinnamon, 
and allspice. Add alum and salt to the vinegar, and pom 
it on boiling hot, the brine being previously turned oflf. I 
will be fit to eat in about three weeks. 

474. French Beans and Radish Pods. 

Take such as are quite small and tender ; throw them 
into salt and water as they are gathered, changing the water 
every four days. Scald them in salt and water ; let them 
remain till cool ; turn ofif the brine, and pour on scalding 



PICKLES. 15T 

Tineffar spiced with mace, allspice, and peppercorns. The 
radish top, if pickled in small bunches, is a pretty garnish 
for other pickles. 

475. Peaches and Apricots. 

Take peaches, fully grown, just before becoming mellow. 
Let them lie covered in a brine made of soft water, strong 
enough to bear up an egg, one week ; take them out, wipe 
them carefully with a soft cloth, place them in a piclde jar. 
Put to a gallon of vinegar half an ounce of cloves, and half 
an ounce of peppercorns, sliced ginger root, mustard seed, 
and a little salt, and pour it on the peaches, boiling hot. 
Turn off the vinegar, and turn it on again, boiling hot, seve- 
ral times. 

476. Nasturtions. 

Put them when green and small in salt and water, and 
change the water every three days. When done collecting 
the nasturtions, pour off the brine, and turn on boiling vin- 
egar, adding a little alum. 

477. Onions. 

Peel and boil small onions in milk and water ten minutes. 
Put to a gallon of vinegar half an ounce of cinnamon, half 
an ounce of mace, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, five 
spoonfuls of salt, and half an ounce of alum, and turn the 
whole boiling hot on the onions, the milk and water being 
first drained from them. 

478. Gherkins. 

Put them in strong brine, and keep them where warm. 
When they turn yellow, pour off the brine, and turn on hot 
vinegar. Keep them in it till they turn green ; then pour 
away the vinegar, and add fresh scalding vinegar, seasoned 
with peppercorns, mace, allspice, alum, and salt. 

479. Mushrooms. No. 1. 
Stew them after peeled, with just water enough to pre- 
vent their sticking to the bottom of the pan. Shake them 
now and then, to prevent their burning. When tender, take 



159 PICKLS.8. 

them up, and put them in scalding vinegar, spiced with 
mace, peppercorns, and cloves, adding a little salt. Bottle 
and cork tight, for long keeping. 

480. Mushrooms, No. 2. 
Take buttons, such only are fit for this use, and rub them 
with a soft flannel and salt ; sprinkle on a little salt ; pu* 
them into a stew pan with a little mace and pepper. As 
the liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them over 
a gentle fire, till all of it is dried in again. Then put as 
much vinegar into the pan as will cover them ; give it one 
warming, and turn the whole into a glas& or stone jar. They 
will keep two years, and they are delicious. 

481. Beets. 

Boil them sufiiciently tender to easily put a fork through 
them ; put them into cold vinegar, with a little salt, set them 
in a cool place, and stir them often to prevent any scum 
from rising. Beets should never be cut or scraped, till 
after boiling. 

482. Oysters and Clams. 

Take the oysters from the liquor ; rinsing off the pieces 
of shell, if any ; strain, boil, and skim it ; then put the 
oysters into the boiling liquor, with whole peppercorns, 
spice, and mace, with a little salt, and boil all one minute. 
Take the oysters immediately- out of the liquor, and let 
them cool ; add as much vinegar as oyster liquor, and boil 
fifteen minutes, and then turn it hot on the oysters. Keep 
them cool and air tight, and they will retain their natural 
color. 

Pickle clams in the same way, only boil them longer. 

•483. Smelts. 

Take and clean two quarts of smelts ; pound, very fine, 
half an ounce of pepper, half of nutmeg, half of saltpetre, 
a quarter of an ounce of mace, and four ounces of common 
salt. Lay the smelts in rows in st jar, and between the 
layers strew the seasoning, with four or five bay leaves. 
Boil red wine, and pour over enough to cover them. When 
cold, tie a cover over them. 



siaun. 169 

484. Mackerel 
Divide each into four or six round pieces. To six large 
mackerel, put one ounce of beaten pepper, three nutmegs, 
a little mace, and a handful of salt. Mix your salt and 
beaten spices together, make two or three holes in each 
piece of mackerel, and put your seasoning into them, rub- 
bing them over with it, and fry them brown in oil. When 
cold, put them in vinegar, and cover them with oil. If well 
covered, they will keep a great while, and they are 
excellent. 

485. Lemon Sirup, 

Pare off the yellow part of the rind of fresh lemons ; 
squeeze out the juice, strain it, and to a pint of it put a 
pound and three-quarters of sugar. Dissolve the sugar by 
a gentle heat, skim it till clear, then, adding the rinds, sim- 
mer gently eight or ten minutes, and strain it through a 
flannel bag. When cool, bottle it, and seal the corks. 

486. Orange Simp, 

^ Squeeze out and strain the juice of fresh oranges. To 
a pint of the juice add a pound and a half of sugar ; place 
it on a moderate dre ; put in the peel of the oranges after 
the sugar has dissolved, and set the sirup where it will boil 
slowly six or eight minutes ; then strain it through a flan- 
nel bag. Do not squeeze the bag while the sirup is pass- 
ing through, if you wish it clear. It is nice to flavor pies 
and puddings. 

487. Blackberry Sirup, 

Procure the high blackberries that are ripe and nice ; 
simmer them over a moderate fire, till they break to pieces, 
and then strain them through a flannel cloth. To each 
pint of the liquor add a pound of white sugar, half an ounce 
of powdered cinnamon, a quarter of an ounce of powdered 
mace, and two teaspoonfuls of powdered cloves. Boil all 
fifteen minutes; strain it, and when cool add to each 
pint of sirup, a wineglass of French brandy. Bottle, 
cork, and seal it, and keep it where cool. This, mixed in 
the n'-QDortion of a wineglass of sirup to two-thirds of a 



160 8W£ETM£A.TS AND JELLIES. 

tumbler of cold water, is an excellent remedy for the dys- 
entery, and similar complaints. It is also a very grateful 
summer beverage. 

488. Elderhe^ Sirup. 

Take berries perfectly ripe ; wash and strain them ; put 
a pint of molasses to a pint of the juice ; boil it twenty 
minutes, stirring it constantly ; when cold, add to each 
quart, a pint of French brandy. Bottle, and cork it tight. 
It is an excellent remedy for a tight cough. 

489. Molasses Sirup for Preserving, 

Mix eight pounds of light sugar-house or. New Orleans 
molasses with eight pounds of water, and one of powdered 
charcoal ; boil all twenty minutes and strain it through a 
flannel bag. When lukewarm, put in the beaten whites of 
two eggs and set it on the fire ; as soon as it boils, take it 
from the ^e and skim it till clear ; set it on the fire again 
and let it boil till it becomes a thick sirup, then strain it for 
use. This sirup does very well to preserve fruit in for 
common use. 

490. Sweetmeats^ Drinks^ ^c. 

The sugar used for the nicest sweetmeats should be the 
best double refined ; but if the pure, amber colored, sugar- 
house sirup, from the West Indies, can be gotten, it is far pre- 
ferable. It never ferments. The trouble is very much lessen- 
ed by having ready made sirup, in which it is only necessary 
to boil the fruit till clear. All delicate fruit should be done 
gently, and not allowed to remain over half an hour after 
it begins to simmer, before it is laid on dishes to cool. It 
must be put in the sirup again another half hour. Con- 
tinue so to do till it is sufficiently transparent. The pre- 
serves are less liable to boil to pieces than if done by one 
continued boiling. 

In preparing sugar for sweetmeats, let it be quite dis- 
solved before you put it on the fire. If dissolved in water, 
allow a tumbler of water to a pound of sugar. If you boil 
the sugar before adding the fruit, it will be improved in 
cleames by passing it through a flannel bag. Skim off the 
brown scum, all the time it is boiling. If sweetmeats are 



SWEETMEATS ANB TELLIES. 161 

boOed too long, they lose Cheir flavor and become dark. 
If not boiled long enough, they will not keep. You may 
know when jelly is done, by dropping a teaspoonful cold 
into a glass of water. If it spreads and mixes with the 
water, it needs more boiling ; if it sinks to the bottom in a 
lump, it is done enough. Raspberry jelly needs most boil- 
ing of any kind. Black currant the least. 

Keep your sweetmeats cool and dry, in glass, China, or 
stone jars. Delicate preserves should be kept in small 
glasses or pots that will not hold more than one or two 
pounds ; the admission of air injures them. Glass is best. 

Cover the top, after sprinkling it over with sugar, with 
white paper dipped in hot clarified sugar. It is far better 
than rum or brandy. Over the whole confine a cover so 
close as to entirely exclude the air 

491. To Clarify Sugar for Sweetmeats, 

Put your sugar into the preserving kettle, pour in as 
<nuch cold water as you think may be wanted to cover the 
fruit to be preserved ; a gill to a pound of sugar ; beat the 
whites of eggs to a froth, allowing one egg to three pounds 
of sugar ; mix the whites with the sugared water ; set it on 
4 slow fire, stirring the whole well together ; then set it 
where it will boil. As soon as it boils up well, take it from 
die fire, let it remain for a minute, then take off the scum ; 
set it back on the fire, and let it boil a minute, then take 
it off and skim it again. Repeat this ope^tion till the sirup 
is clear ; and put the fruit in when it is cold. The fruit 
should not be crowded while doing ; and if there is not suffi- 
cient sirup to cover the fruit, take it out of the sirup, and put 
in more water, and boil it with the sirup before putting back 
tho fruit. 

492. Directions for Making Sweetmeats. 

For preserving most kinds of fruit, a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit is sufficient. Some kinds of fruit require 
more, and some will do with less, than their weight of su- 
gar. Good bro^vn sugar, if clarified before putting in the 
iruit, does very well, for most kinds of fruit; and for family 
use, three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of frui 
does very well. The nicest white sugar needs not be clari 



162 SWEETKSATS AND JELUiiS. 

fied. All kinds of fire-pioof waie, except iion ware, will 
do to preserve in. Enameled kettles of iron lined with 
china, called preserve ketUes, are best The firoit should 
be turned out of the preserving kettle as soon as done, and 
set aw^y. It should be looked to often, to see that it does 
not ferment Whenever it does, the sirup should be turned 
off and scalded, and turned back while hot 

493. Quince Marmalade, 

The fruit should not be over ripe — ^not meUow. Gather 
it on a dry day, and after a dry day. Some make this pre- 
serve, by covering the fruit and sugar close in a wide 
mouthed jar, and then setting the jar in a kettle of cold 
water, and thus boiling the fruit till tender. This preserves 
its flavor. 

Wash and quarter the quinces, without paring ; set them 
on the fire with just sufficient water to stew them ; rub 
them through a sieve, when soft, >nd put to each pound of 
the pulp a pound of btown sugar ; set it on a few coals, 
stew slowly and stir it constancy. When it has simmered 
an hour, take out a little and cool it, if it then cuts smooth, 
it is sufficiently done. 

494. Preserved Qiiinces, 

Parer and core your quinces, taking out tilie parts that are 
knotty and defective ; cut them in quarters, or round slices ; 
put them in your preserving kettle ; cover them with the 
parings and a very little water ; lay a large plate over them 
to keep in the steam, and boil them till they are tender. 
Take out the quinces, and strain the liquor through a bag. 
To every pint of liquor, allow a pound of loaf sugar. Boil 
the juice and sugar together about ten minutes, skimming it 
well ; put in the quinces and boil them gently twenty min- 
utes. When the sugar has completely penetrated them, 
take them out, put them in a glass jar, and turn the juice 
over ihem warm. Tie them up, when cold, with paper 
dipped in clarified sugar. 

/ 495. Preserved Pine Apples, 
Having pared your pine apples, slice them, and take o« 



SWEETMEATS AND JELLIES. 163 

die core from the middle of each slice. To each pound 6t 
pine apple allow a pound of loaf sugar. Mix half the su- 
gar with the pine apple, and let them lie all night, to extract 
the juice ; then mix them with the remaining half of the su- 
gar, and put the whole in a preserving kettle. Boil it till 
clear and tender, hut not till the slices break. Skim it well ; 
set away to cool ; — or, without boiling, chop fine, and add 
equal weight of sugar ; put in glass jars, and seal tight. 

496. Preserved Currants, 

Take ripe currants, in their prime ; strip them off their 
stems, rejecting the bad ones ; make a sirup of sugar and 
very little water, allowing a pound of Sugar to each pound 
of currants, and let them boil a few minutes. In a few 
days turn the sirup from them, scald it, and turn it back, 
while hot, oa. the currants. Preserred currants, mixed 
with water, are an excellent drink in fevers. Dried cur- 
rants are also good, made into a tea, for the same use. 

497. Preserved Strawberries, 

To each pound of picked strawberries, allow a pound 
of powdered loaf sugar. Strew half of the sugar over the 
strawberries, and let them stand in a cool place two or three 
hours ; put them in a preserving kettle, over a slow fire, and 
by degrees, strew on the rest of the sugar ; boil them fifteen 
or twenty minutes, and skim them well. Put them in wide 
mouthed bottles, and when cold, seal the corks. If you 
wish to do. them whole, take them carefully out of the sirup, 
(one by one,) while boiling, spread them to cool on large 
dishes, not letting the strawberries touch each other ; when 
cool, return them to the sirup, and boil them a little longer. 
Repeat this several times. Keep the bottles in dry sand. 

Gooseberries, currants, cherries, grapes, and raspberries 
may be done in the same way. 

498. Preserved Pippins. 

Pare and core some of the finest ; put them in your pre- 
serving kettle, with some lemon peel and all the parings 
add a very little water, cover closely, boil till tender, taking 
care that they do not bum ; take out the apples, spreading 
them on a large dish to cool ; pour the liquor into a bag 



164 SWEETMEATS . AND JELLIES.* 

and strain it ; put it in your kettle with a pound of loaf so* 
gar to a pint of juice, adding lemon juice to the taste ; boil 
diem slowly half an hour, or till they are quite soft and 
clear ; put them with the liquor into your jar, and when 
quite cold, tie them up with clariued, or with brandy paper. 
They are not intended for long keeping. 

Hard pears may be done in the same way, either whole 
or halved, flavoring Jiem fb the taste. 

499. Preserved Crab Apples, 

Wash the apples ; cover the bottom of your preserving 
kettle with grape leaves ; put them in ; place them over the 
fire, with a very little water, covering them closely ; sim- 
mer them gently till yellow ; take them out and spread 
them on a large dish to cool; pare and core them;, put 
them again into your kettle, with fresh vine leaves under 
and over them, and a very little water, and hang them over 
the fire till they are green, but do not let them l^il. When 
green, take them out ; allow a pound of loaf sugar to a 
pound of apple ; dissolve the sugar in just sufficient water ; 
put it over the fire, when dissolved ; boil and skim it ; put 
in your apples, and boil them till quite clear and tender. 
Put them in jars, turn the juice over them, and when cold, 
tie them up. 

500. Preserved Apples, 

Take equal weights of good brown sugar and of apples ; 
peel or wash, core, and chop the apples fine ; allow to every 
three pounds of sugar a pint of water ; dissolve, then boil 
the sugar pretty thick, skimming it well ; add the apples, 
the grated peel of one or two lemons, and two or diree 
pieces of white ginger ; and boil till the apples look clear 
and yellow. This will keep years. Crab apples done in 
this way, without paring, are next to cranberries. 

501. Transparent Apples, 

Dissolve and boil a pound of loaf sugar in a quart of wa- 
ter ; skim it ; put in select apples, pared, quartered, and 
cored, with the juice of a lemon, and let them boil, uncov 
ered, till tender. 



SWEETMEATS AND JELLIES. 165 

502. Good Family Apple-sauce. 

Take two quarts of water, a pint of molasses, and a root 
of race ginger, and boil all hard twenty minutes. Put in, 
while boiling, a peck of pared, quartered, and cored apples, 
and boil the whole moderately an hour and a half or two 
hours. 

503. Cider Apple Sauce. See Nos. 515 and 651. 
Boil down new sweet cider, till about as thick as molas- 
ses when cold, strain it through a sieve, then, as soon as 
it boils, put in your apples, pared, quartered, and cored, and 
stew over a slow coal fire, till the fruit is perfectly tender. 

504. Black Butter. 

Allow to any kind of berries, stoned cherries, currants, 
&c., half their weight of sugar, and^ boil till reduced one- 
quarter. This is a healthful and nice substitute for butter 
for children. 

505. Preserved Peaches. 

Select the largest and nicest free-stone peaches, fully 
grown but not mellow, pare, halve, or quarter them ; crack 
the stones, take out and break the kernels ;' put parings and 
all into your preserving kettle, with a very little water ; 
boil till tender ; then take out and spread the peaches on a 
large dish to cool. Strain the liquor through a sieve or bag ; 
next day, put to each pint of the liquor a pound of loaf sugar. 
Put the liquor and sugar, dissolved, into the kettle with the 
peaches, and boil them slowly till they are quite soft, skim- 
ming all the time ; take the peaches out, put them into your 
jars, and turn the liquor over them warm. When cold, tie 
them up with clarified paper. If boiled too long, they will 
be of a dark color. To preserve peaches whole, thrust out 
the stones with a skewer, and put in their place, after done, 
the kernels blanched. Broad, shallow, stone pots keep 
large fruit the best. 

8 lbs., fruit, and 8 sugar. Scald peaches, few at a time, in 
u little water with 2 lbs. sugar. Let he in this thin sirup 
2 days. Drain and put them in remaining 6 lbs. of melted 
sugar, and scald 8 or 10 minutes. Other fruits same way.

j^06. * Peaches J Apricots^ and PlumSj preserved in Brandy, 

Take nice yellow peaches, not too mellow ; put them in 
a poty and cover them with weak cold lye ; take them out in 
€oe hour, and wipe them carefully with a soft cloth to get 
off the down and skin, and lay them in cold water ; tdce 
their weight in loaf sugar, adding enough water to cover the 
fruit ; boU and skim it ; put in £e peaches, and stew them 
from eight to fifteen minutes ; take them out and lay them 
on dishes to cool ; boil the sirup till reduced one half ; then 
tie up the peaches cold, covering them with equal quanti- 
ties of sirup and French brandy. Do apricots in the same 
way, only let them stew but five or six minutes. Plums 
and cherries are excellent preserved in the same manner. 

507. Preserved Cranberries. 

Allow to each pound of washed cranberries, a pound of 
loaf sugar, dissolved in about a gill of water, first boiling 
the sugar and skimming it well about ten minutes, then add- 
ing the cranberries. Boil slowly, till they are quite soft 
and of a fine color. Put them up warm. When cold, tie 
them up. Common glass tumblers are very convenient for 
preserved small fruits and jellies. 

508. Preserved Gages, 

Take equal weights of gages and sugar ; dissolve the su- 
gar in just sufficient water to cover the plums ; boil them 
slowly in the sirup ten minutes ; turn them into a dish, and 
let them remain four or five days ; boil them again, till the 
sirup appears to have entered the plums ; put Qiem up ; in 
a week, turn the sirup from them, scald it, turn it over them 
hot ; and, when cold, tie them up. 

509. Preserved Damsons. 

Allow for every pound of damsons three-quarters of a 
pound of powdered sugar ; put alternate layers of fruit and 
ragar into jars, or well-glazed earthen pots ; tie over strong

day, strain off tlie sirup, boil it till thick, turn it warm over 
the fruit in jars, and, when cold, tie up. 

510. Preserved Pumpkin, 

Cut slices from a nice, high-colored pumpkin, and cut 
the slices into chips about the thickness of a dollar ; have 
the chips of an equal size, six inches in length, and an inch 
broad. Put to each pound of fruit a pound of loaf sugar. 
Pare off and lay aside the yellow rind of some lemons ; 
squeeze out the juice, allowing a gill to a pound of pump- 
kin. Put the pumpkin into a broad pan, laying the sugar 
among it ; turn the lemon juice over it ; cover the pan, and 
let the whole set all night. In the morning, put the whole 
in a preserving pan, and boil, skimming it well, till the 
pumpkin becomes clear and crisp, but not till it breaks. It 
should have the appearance of lemon candy ; and,- if liked, 
some lemon peel, cut in very fine pieces, may be added. 
About half an hour's boiling is sufficient. When done, take 
out the pumpkin, spread it on a large dish, and strain the 
sirup through a bag ; put it into jars, turn the sirup over it, 
and tie up. It is very nice ; may be eaten without cream, 
or laid on puff paste shells after they are baked. 

511. Preserved Grapes. 

Allow a pound of sugar to a pound of grapes ; squeeze 
out the pulp, and boil it till quite soft ; strain it through 
cloth ; to this add your sugar and clarify it ; then throw in 
your skins, and bpU till thick enough to please. 

512. Preserved Pears, 

AUoW three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of 
p^ars. Clarify the sugar, if brown is used, then put in the 
fruit, and boil it till tender. A few pieces of ginger, or fine 
ginger tied up in bags, may be boiled with the pears, to fla- 
vor them. Vergouleuse and choke pears are the best for 
preserving. 

513. Winter Bell Pears, 

Take some of the nicest, put them in an iron poi, filling 
it about half full, cover them with water, and boil them. 
After giving them a thorough boiling, and making them ten-

der, It)t tkem steam over a slow fire, covering the pot close, 
to confine the steam, five or six hours, till but just sufficient 
juice 10 prevent their burning. If done right, they will be 
as red as cranberry preserves, retaining all the rich natural 
flavor of the pear, and will require car^ in taking up to pre- 
vent their breaking. They are nice, thus plainly cooked ; 
but if preferred, a little molasses may be added toward the 
last. 

514. Preserved Cherries. 

Take cherries before dead ripe ; allow a pound of white 
sugar to a pound of fruit ; dissolve and boil the sugar, hav- 
ing it thick, put in the cherries with the stems on, and let 
them boil till transparent. Tie them up in glass jars. 
The carnation and common light red, if done carefully, will 
be so transparent the stones may be seen through them. 

To preserve them without the stones, take such as arcr 
very ripe, push out the stone carefully with a darning nee- 
dle, make sirup of the juice, and then boil the cherries to a 
thick consistency. 

515. Quince and Apple Sauce. See Nos. 503, 651. 

3 lbs. quince ; 6 lbs. apple ; 6 sugar ; and 2 or 3 lem- 
ons. Cluarter quinces and apples. When both boiled soft, 
add sugar. Boil an hour. Boil lemons, sliced, in a little 
water, till soft, and stir them in just before taking from fire. 

516. Preserved Tomatoes. 

Take tomatoes quite small and green, and if fully ripe 
ihey are nice ; put them in cold clarified sirup, with one 
orange, cut in slices, to every two pounds of tomatoes ; sim- 
mer them gently two or three hours, allowing equal weights 
of sugar and tomatoes, and more than barely enough water 
to cover the tomatoes, for the sirup. 

Another very nice method of preserving them is, allow 
two fresh lemons to three pounds of the tomatoes ; pare oQ. 
only the yellow part of the rind ; squeeze out the juice, and 
mix the rind and juice with enough cold water to cover the 
tomatoes, and add a few peach leaves and powdered ginger 
tied up in bags. Boil all gently together, forty-five minutes, 
Ibke out the tomatoes, strain the liquor, and put to it a pound 
and a half of white sugar, for each pound of tomatoes ; put 



SWEETMEATS AND TELLIES. 169 

in the tomatoes, and boil them gently till the sirup appeals 
to have penetrated them. In about a week, turn off th« 
sirup, scald it, and turn it back. Thus preserved, tomalOM 
appear like West India sweetmeats. 

517. Tomato Marmalade. 

Take full grown tomatoes while quite green, cut out thd 
stems, stew &em till soft, rub them through a sieve, set the 
pulp on the fire, seasoned highly with salt, pepper, pounded 
cloves, and garlic, if liked, and stew all together till thick. 
It is excellent for seasoning gravies &c., and keeps well. 

518. CynUings, or Mock Citron. 

Cut the cymlings, (Virginia squashes,) in rings, or slips, 
and scrape them ; put them in strong salt and water three 
days, then in fair water one day, changing the water sev- 
eral times; soak them in alum water one hour; tie up 
oyster shells in a cloth and boil them with the cymlings tiu , 
the' fruit is tender, then take it up and put it back into the 
alum water. Allow for the sirup, a pound and a half of 
loaf sugar to a pound of cymlings ; boil in it some fresh 
lemon cut in slices, and spices to the taste. When cold,' 
rinse the cymlings, and boil them about three-quarters of an 
hour. These are good eaten as other sweetmeats, or for 
cake, instead of citron. 

Preserve watermelon rinds in the same manner. Tie 
up with clarified or brandy paper. 

519. Raspberry f Blackhfrry, and Strawberry Jam, 

For each pound of fruit allow a pound of sugar ; make 
alternate layers of sugar and berries in your preserving 
dish ; let them remain half an hour, then boil them slowly 
about half an hour, stirring them frequently. Put a little in 
a cup, and set it in a dish of cold water for trial. Boil till 
it becomes the consistency of thick jelly. 

520. Calf s Feet Jelly. 

Take four scalded feet, perfectly clean ; boil them ift 
four quarts of water till reduced to one, or till they are vmy 
tender ; take them from the fire and let them remain tiu

perfectly cold ; then take off all the fat, and scrape off the 
dregs that stick to the jelly. ^Put it in a preserving kettle, 
and place it on a slow fire. Oh melting, take it from the 
fire ; mix with it, half a pint of white wine, the juice and 
grated rind of two fresh lemons, and a stick of cinnamon* 
or blade of mace. Wash and wipe dry six eggs ; stir the 
whites, beaten to a froth, into the jelly when cold ; bruise 
the shells and add them ; then set it on a few coals ; when 
hoty sweeten to the taste. Let all boil slowly fifteen min- 
utes, without stirring it ; then suspend a fiannel bag, and 
let ibe jelly drain through it into a pitcher or deep dish. 
If it is not clear, wash the bag and pass it through till it is 
perfectly so. Do not squeeze the bag. When transparent, 
turn it into glasses, and set them, if Sie weather is hot, into 
cold water, and keep them in a cool place. It will k^^p 
but a few days in warm weather. 

Some take eight calf's feet, a pint of white wine, three 
lemons, the whites of six eggs, half an ounce of cinnamon, 
half a pound of loaf sugar, with only three quarts of water, 
and proceed in a similar way, adding two spoonfuls of 
French brandy, and reduce the whole to one quart. 

A knuckle of veal, and sheep's feet make a nice jelly 
When jelly is perfectly congealed, dip the mould an instant 
into boiling water, to loosen it. 

521. Lemon Jelly, 

Set on a slow fire a pint of water, with one ounce of rins- 
ed isinglass, in small pieces, and the rind of six lemons ; stir 
constantly till the isinglass is dissolved ; add a pint of lemon 
juice, and sweeten it to the taste, with loaf sugar. Boil 
all, four or five minutes ; color with the tincture of saffron, 
and pass it through a fiannel bag, without squeezing it. Fill 
your jelly glasses with it when partly cool. 

522. Stratoberry, Raspberry , and Blackberry Jelly. 

The jellies of all these berries are made in a similar 
manner. Take the berries when ripe, and such as are 
prime, mash them, and let them drain through a flannel bag 
without squeezing it. Put to a pint of the juice, a pound 
of loaf sugar and one third of the white of an egg ; set it 



SWEETMEATS AND JELMES. 171 

on the fire ; on boiling up- well, remove it from the fire and 
skim it clear ; set it back ; if more scum rises, remove it 
from the fire again, and skim it ofif. Boil till it becomes a 
jelly. , If, when cold, on dropping it into a tumbler of cold 
water it falls to the bottom in solid form, it is jellied. Tie 
up with clarified or brandy paper. 

523. Cranberry, Grape, and Currant, Jelly, 

Wash, and drain the fruit till nearly dry ; put it in an 
earthen jar ; put the jar in a kettle of water ; set the kettle 
where the water will boil, taking care that none of it gets 
into the jar. When the fruit breaks, pour it into a flannel bag 
to drain, without squeezing it. When strained, add to each 
pint of juice, a pound and a half of white sugar, and half 
the beaten white of an egg. Boil the sirup gently, taking 
it back from the fire as fast as any scum rises, and skim it 
clear. After boiling fifteen or twenty minutes, drop a tea- 
spoonful of it, cold, into a tumbler of water, to ascertain if 
it is jelly. Jellies are improved by being set in the sun a 
few days. Currant jelly is best made of equal quantities 
of White and red currants. The juice of black currants re- 
quires but about half the sugar, and half the time to boil it 
tibat the red does. 

524. Apple and Quince Jelly, Seepage 194. 

Crab apples make the nicest apple jelly. Wash them, 
cut out the defects, the stem, the blossom end, and the 
seeds, quartering the apples, but neither pare them, nor 
take out the hulls-^ lay them in your preserving kettle ; and 
put to them just sufficient water to cover them. Boil till 
soft, but not till they break. Drain oflf the water through 
a colander ; rnash the apples with the back of a spoon ; put 
them in a jelly bag, place a deep dish under it, and squeeze 
out the juice. To every pint of juice, allow a pound of loaf 
sugar ; boil slowly, skimming it well, about ten or twenty 
minutes, or until it is a jelly. Dip it out while boiling, with 
a silver spoon, into your tumblers and moulds ; cover with 
a prepared paper, and tie another paper close over the glass 
Quince jelly is made in the same way. Pippins and bell 
flowers make good jelly. Add lemon peel if you like. 



172 COMMON DRINKS. 

525. Molasses Candy, 
Take two quarts of West India molasses, one pounil of 
brown sugar, and the juice of two large lemons, or a tea-- 
spoonful of strong essence of lemon ; mix, and boil the 
molasses and sugar three hours, over a moderate fire, (whon 
done it will cease boiling, and be crisp when cold.) While 
boiling, stir it frequenuy, inserted m a tin pail. After 
boiling two hours and a half, stir in the lemon juice. ^ ft 
will be improved by grating in the yellow part ot the rind 
so fine as not to be visible when boiled. If the lemon is 
put in too soon, all the taste will be boiled out When it 
is quite done, butter a square tin pan, and turn the mixture 
in to cool. If you prefer the candy with ground nuts, roast 
a quart of them, shell and blanch them,* and stir them in 
gradually, a few minutes before you take it from the fire 
Almonds may be blanched, cut in pieces, and stirred in raw, 
when the sugar and molasses have just done boiling. If 
you wish to make it yellow, take some out of the tin pan 
while it is yet warm, and pull it out into a thick string, be- 
tween the thumb and fore-finger of both hands. Extend 
your arms widely as you pull the candy backwards and 
forwards. By repeating this a long time, it will gradually 
become of a light yellow color, and of a spongy consistency. 
When it is quite yellow, roll it into sticks, twist two sticks 
together, and cut them off smoothly at both ends. Or you 
may variegate it by twisting together a stick that is quite 
yellow and one that remains brown. 

526. Coffee. 

Old Java and Mocha are the best kinds. Coffee should 
be dried in an iron pot, over a moderate fire, for some hours 
before it is roasted. Hang the pot so high as not to bum 
it. After dr3dng three or four hours, place it on a hot bed 
of coals, and stir it constantly until roasted enough, which 
is determined by biting one of the lightest colored kernels. 
If brittle, pronounce the whole done. Put into two or three 
pounds a bit of bi)tter as big as a walnut, before taking it 
ofi*. Box it tight, immediately, to keep in the steam. A 
coffee roaster is the best thing to roast coffee in. It con- 
fines the fine aromatic flavor of the coffee, which otherwise 



COMMON DRINKS. 173 

escapes with the steam. For good common coffee, allow 
from one to two spoonfuls, ground, to a pint of water. Pour 
the water on' boiling hot, and boil it in a coflee pot, from 
twenty to twenty-five minutes* It will not taste fresh and 
lively, if boiled longer. Let it stand, after removed from 
the fire, four or five minutes to settle, then turn it oflf care- 
fully from the grounds, into an urn or coffee pot. When 
the coffee is put on the fire to boil, put a piece of isinglass, 
or fish skin, the size of a dime, into it, or the white and 
shell of an egg, for two quarts of coffee. Many dislike to 
fine coffee with fish skin, thinking it imparts an unpleasant 
. taste ; but it will not, if prepared properly. Take the skin 
from mild codfish that has not been soaked, as soaking de- 
stroys its effects ; rinse it in cold water, and dry it perfectly, 
it may be done in the oven after drawing the Bread ; when 
dry, cut it into pieces of the si^e of a dime, and keep them 
in a paper bag for use. Put one of these dime-pieces into 
from a quart to two quarts of coffee, when you set it on the 
fire to boil. If you cannot get cream for your coffee, boil 
the coffee with less water, and weaken it with boiling milk, 
when served out in cups. 

Some cooks say, allow two spoonfuls of fresh roasted 
coffee for each person ; grind it just before making ; put it 
in a basin, and break into it the white, yolk, and shell of 
one egg ; mix it up with a spoon to the consistency of a 
thick pulp ; put warm, not boiling, water in the coffee pot ; 
place, and let it stand on the fire, till it boils up and breaks 
three times. Then take it off and let it stand a few min^ 
utes, and it will be as clear as amber, and the egg will give 
it a rich taste. 

527. French Method of Preparing Coffee, 

Divide the quantity to be roasted into two parts ; roast 
one part in a coffee roaster, turn it constantly, till the coffee 
is the color of dried almonds, and has lost one eighth of its 
weight. Roast the other part, till the color of chestnuts, 
and it has lost one-fifth of its weight. Roast and grind 
your coffee the day it is to be used ; mix the two parts, and 
grind them in a coffee mill. To two ounces of ground coffee 
put four cups of cold water ; draw this off, and set it one

tide. Put to the, same coffee, three cupd of boiling water? 
draw this off and add it to the cold infusion. When wanted, 
heat it qnickly, in a silver coffee pot. Do not let it boil i 
the perfume will be lost by evaporation. Do not make the 
coffee in a tin vessel. Make it in China, delft-ware, or in 
silver. 

528. Coffee Cream. 

Mix three cups of nice clear coffee, and sugar to the 
taste, and boil with a pint of cream till reduced about one 
third. 

529. Cocoa Shells. 

Put your shells soaking over^ night; then boil them in 
the same water in the morning. They are healthful and 
cheap. 

530. ChocolaU. • 

Allow to each square, or spoonful, of fine scraped choco« 
late, about a piat of water ; boil from fifteen to twenty min- 
utes, then add cream, or milk, and sugar to the taste, and 
boil it, uncovered, about ten minutes longer. 

531. Tea. 

Scald the tea-]K)t, and put in a teaspoonful to a person, if 
the tea is strong { if it is a weak kind, put in more ; turn 
on just sufficient boiling water to cover your tea, and let it 
steep — green tea, five or six minutes, (if longer it will not 
be lively,) and black tea, ten or twelve minutes. Fill up 
your tea-pot with boiling water, on carrying it to the table ; 
and keep your tea-kettle boiling, to fill up your tea-pot as 
it may want — careful not to have smoky tea. Black tea is 
more healthful than green. Hyson and souchong, half and 
half, is a pleasanter and more healthful beverage, for such as 
drink strong tea, than green alone. 

532. Eau Sucre. 

Sweeten boiling water with sugar to your taste. This : 
beverage is considered soporific ; is good for weak nerves; * 
and is much used by French ladies.

633. Currant Wine. 

Mix one quart of strained currant juice, with two quarts 
of water, and three pounds of sugar. After stirring the 
whole together, let it rest twenty-four hours ; then skim, 
and set it in a cool place, where it will ferment slowly. At 
the end of three or four days, or when fermentation has 
about ceased, close up the barrel tight, which should be full. 
When it becomes clear, bottle it. 

534. Grape Wine. 

To each gallon of bruised perfectly ripe grapes, add a 
gallon of water, and let the whole stand a week ; then draw 
off the liquor, and put to every gallon three pounds of lump 
sugar. When fermentation, in a temperate situation, is 
about over, stop it close. In about six months bottle it. 

535. To Mull Wine. 

Put a teaspoonful of powdered cloves and cinnamon to a 
pint of water ; place it where it will boil ; then separate the 
yolks and whites of three eggs, and beat the yolks with a 
spoonful of powdered sugar. When the water boils, turn 
it on the yolks and sugar ; add a pint of wine, and pour the 
beaten whites of the eggs over the whole. 

536. Ginger Wine. 

To three gallons of water, put three pounds of sugar, 
and four ounces of race ginger, washed perfectly clean ; 
boil them one hour, and then strain through a sieve. When 
lukewarm, put it in a cask with three lemons cut in slices, 
and half a pint of beer yeast. Mix it well together, and 
make the cask tight. After fermenting about a week, or 
lill clear, bottle it. It may then be used in about ten days 

537. Orgeat. — An Excellent Rtfreshment for Parties. 

Boil two quarts of milk with a stick of cinnamon, and let 
it stand to be quite cold, taking out the cinnamon. Blanch 
fi>ur ounces of the best sweet almonds ; pound them in a 
giarble mortar, with a little rose-water; mix them mcW 



176 COMMON DRINKS. 

with the milk ; sweeten it to your taste ; let it boil only a 
few minutes ; strain it through a very fine sieve till quite 
smooth, and free from^the almonds ; and serve it up either 
cold or lukewarm, in handled glasses. 

538. Sherbet. 

Boil in three pints of water, six or eight stalks of green 
rhubarb, and four ounces of raisins or figs ; when the wa- 
ter has boiled about half an hour, strain it, and mix it with 
a teaspoonful of rose-water, and orange or lemon sirup to 
the taste. Drink it cold. 

539. Cherry Shruh. 

Pick ripe Morello cherries from the stem ; put them in 
an earthen pot ; place that in an iron pot of water ; boil till 
the juice is extracted ; strain it through a cloth thick enough 
to retain the pulp, and sweeten it to your taste. When 
perfectly clear, bottle it, sealing the cork. By first putting 
a gill of brandy into each boule, it will keep through the 
summer. It is delicious mixed with water. 

540. Currant Shruh, 

To a pound of sugar, add a pint of strained currant juice; 
boil it gently eight or ten minutes, skimming it well ; take it 
oflf; and when lukewarm, add half a gill of brandy to eve- 
ry pint of shrub. Bottle tight. 

541. Raspberry Shrub. 

Put one quart of vinegar to three quarts of ripe raspber- 
ries ; after standing a day, strain it, adding to each pint a 
pound of sugar, and skim it clear, while bailing about half 
an hour. Put a wineglass of brandy to each pint of the 
shrub, when cool. Two spoonfuls of this mixed with a 
tumbler of water, is an excellent drink in fevers. 

542. Lemon Shrub. 

Pare a thin rind off from fresh lemons ; squeeze out 
and strain the juice ; put to a pint of it, a pound of sugar 



COMMON BRINKS 17Y 

broken in small pieces ; take for each pint of the sirup three 
spoonfuls of brandy, and soak the rind of the lemon in it. 
Let all stand one day, frequently stirring up the lemon juice 
and sugar. Next day pour off the sirup, and mix it with 
the brandy and lemon rinds. Keep it under sealed corks, 
in dry sand, in a cool place. 

543. Lemonade, 

Mix the juice of two lemons with a pint of water, sweet- 
ening to the taste. Some like nutmeg grated on it, or 
some of the squeezed lemon cut in it. 

544. Common Beer, 

Allow at the rate of twa gallons of water to a handful of 
hdps, a little fresh spruce, or sweet fern, and a quart of 
bran; boil it two or three hours ; strain it through a sieve ; 
stir in, while hot, a teacup of molasses to each gallon of 
hquor ; let it stand till lukewarm ; turn it into a clean bar- 
rel ; add a pint of good yeast to the barrel ; shake it well 
together, and it may be used next day. 

545. Spring Beer, 

Take a small bunch of sweet fern, sarsaparilla, winter- 
green, sassafras, prince's pine, cumfrey root, burdock root, 
nettle root, Solomon's seal, spice bush, and black birch ; 
boil part, or all of them, in three or four gallons of water, 
with two or three ounces of hops, and two or three raw 
potatoes, pared and cut in slices. Their strength is bet- 
ter extracted by boiling in two waters, for when the liquor is 
saturated with the hops, it will rather bind up the roots than 
extract their juices. Boil the roots five or six hours ; strain 
the liquor ; and add a quart of molasses to three gallons 
of beer. To have the beer very rich, brown half a pound 
of bread and put it into the liquor. If the liquor is too thick, 
dilute/it with cold water. When lukewarm, put in a pint of 
fresh lively yeast. Place it in a temperate situation, cover- 
ed, but not so closely as to retard fermentation. After fer 
mentation, bottle it close, or keep it in a tight keg.

546. Lemon Beer. 

To a gallon of water, add a sliced lemon, a spoonful of 
ginger, half a pint of yeast, and sugar enough to make it 
quite sweet. 

547. Hop Beer. 

Turn five quarts of water on six ounces of hops ; boil 
three hours ; strain off the liquor; turn on four quarts more 
of water, and twelve spoonfids of ginger, and boil the hops 
three hours longer ; strain, and mix it with the other liquor, 
and stir in two quarts of molasses. Brown very dry half 
a pound of bread, and put in — ^rusked bread is best. Pound 
it fine, and brown it in a pot, like ooffee. After cooling to 
be about lukewarm, add a pint of new yeast that is free 
from salt. Keep the beer covered, in a temperate situa- 
tion, till fermentation has ceased, which is known by the 
settling of the froth ; then turn it into a keg or bottles, and 
keep it in a cool place. 

548. Ginger Beer, 

Turn two gallons of boiling water on two pounds of brown 
sugar, or to a quart of molasses, one and a half ounces of 
cream of tartar, and the same of ginger ; stir them well, and 
pat it into a cask. When milkwarm, put in half a pint of 
good yeast, stopping the cask close, and shaking it well. ^ 
Bottle it in about twenty four hours. In ten days it wiU 
sparkle like Champaigne. One or two lemons sliced in, 
will much improve it. It is excellent in warm weather. 

549. Quick Ginger Beer. 

To a pail of water, add two ounces of ginger, one pin 
of molasses, and a gill of good yeast. In two hours it is 
fit for use. 

550. Spruce Beer. 

Boil one handful of hops, and two of the chips of sassa- 
fras root, in ten gallons of water ; strain it, and turn on, 
while hot, a gallon of molasses, two spoonfuls of the essenco 
of spruce, two spoonfuls of ginger, and one of pounded all 
spice. Put it into a cask ; and when cold enough, add

ESSENCES. 179 

half a pint of good yeast ; stir it well ; stop it close ; when 
clear, bottle and cork it. 

551. Beer of Essential Oils, 

Mix two quarts of boilinjg water with a pint and a half 
of molasses ; stir in five quarts of cold water, ten drops of 
tho oil of sassafras, ten of spruce, fifteen of wintergreen, 
and a teaspoonful of the essence of ginger ; when luke- 
warm, turn in half a pint of fresh lively yeast. After fer- 
mented, bottle and cork it, and keep it where cool. It may 
be used in two or three days. 

552. Essence of Lemon, 

Turn gradually two ounces of strong rectified spirit on a 
drachm of the best oil of lemons. But the best way of ob- 
taining the essence of lemon peel, is to rub all the yellow 
part of the peel off, with lumps of white sugar, and scrape 
oflf the surface of _the sugar into a preserving pot, as fast as 
it becomes saturated with the oil of the lemon. Press the 
sugar close, and cover it tight. A little of this sugar im- 
parts a fine flavor to puddings, pies, and cakes. This is 
the preferable mode of obtaining and preserving the essence 
of lemon. You have the fine aromatic flavor of the peel, 
without the alloy of the spirit. 

553. Essence of Ginger, 

Grate, and put into a quart of French brandy, three ounces 
of fresh ginger, with the yellow part of the rind of a fresh 
lemon ; shake it up well, and daily, ten days, when it may 
be used. It is nice for flavoring many kinds of sweetmeats ; 
and a little of it mixed with water, or put on a piece of su- 
gar, subserves all the purposes of ginger tea, and is far more 
palatable. 

554. Rose-water, 

On a dry day, gather fragrant, full-blown roses ; pick 
olT the leaves ; to each peck put a quart of water ; put the 
whole in a cold still, and set the still on a moderate fire — 
the slower they are distilled, the better will be the rose- 
water. Bottle the water immediately after it is distilled,

555. Aromatic Vinegar. 

Mix with a spoonful of vinegar powdered chalk suffi- 
cient to destroy its acidity ; let it settle ; turn off the vine- 
gar from the chalk with care, and dry it. To purify an 
infected room, put in a few drops of sulphuric acid. The 
fumes arising from it will purify a room where there has 
been any infectious disorder. In using it, be very careful 
not to inhale the fumes, or to soil your garments with the 
acid. It will corrode whatever it touches. 

55G. To Extract the Essential Oil of Flowers. 

Take a quantity of fresh, fragrant leaves, both the stalk 
and flower leaves ; cord very thin layers of cotton, and dip 
them in fine Florence oil ; put alternate layers of the cot- 
ton and leaves in a glass jar, or large tumbler ; sprinkle a 
very little fine salt on each layer of the flowers ; cover the 
jar close, and place it in a window exposed to the sun. 
In two weeks a fragrant oil may be squeezed out of the cot- 
ton. Rose leaves, mignonette, and sweet scented clover, 
make nice perfumes. 

557. Cologne Water. 

Pour a quart of alcohol gently on the following oOs :^ 
on two drachms of the oil of rosemary, two of the oil of 
lemon, or orange-flower water, one drachm of lavender, ten 
drops of cinnamon, and a tea-spoonful of rose-water. Stop all 
tight in a bottle ; shake it up well. 

Another way. Put into a quart of highly rectified spirits 
of wine, the following oils : — two drachms of oil of lemon, 
two of rosemary, one of lavender, two of bergamot, ten 
drops of cinnamon, ten of cloves, two of roses, and eight 
of the tincture of cinnamon. If wished very strong, put 
double the quantity of oils to a pint only of the spirits. 

558. Perfume Bags. 

Take rose and sweet scented clover leaves, dried in the 
•hade, then mixed with powdered mace, cloves, and cinna- 
mon, and pressed in small bags, and lay the bags in chests

of linen, or in drawers of clothes. They make a nice 
perfume. 

559. Lavender Water. 

Pour a pint of alcohol moderately to an ounce and a half 
of the oil of lavender, and two drachms of ambergris. Keep 
it in a bottle tightly corked ; shake it up well on putting it in. 

560. To Extract a ClovCy Bean, or any Artificial Substance, 

from the Nose of a Child, 

Press with the finger the well nostril, so as to completely 
close it, at the same time fitting your lips to the child's 
closely ; blow with a sudden pufif into the child's mouth. 
The writer thus extracted a clove from the nose of a young 
child. 

561. To Prevent the Quinsy, or Swollen Glands, and to 

Cure Sore Throat. 

Apply freely, daily, or every time of washing the face, 
cold water under the chin and about^the neck. The eflfect 
has been witnessed. It is a sure preventive. The tooth- 
ache too will be a rare visitor, and probably a total stranger. 
Wash your children daily and thoroughly in cold water, as 
the best preventive of colds. 

For sore throat, drink a tumbler of molasses and water, 
half and half, on going to bed, bathing the feet and applying 
mustard drafts ; rub your throat with a mixture of sweet or 
goose oil and spirits of turpentine, or salt and lard ; then 
wear flannel. Turn your woollen stocking, and apply foot 
part next the throat, when going to bed, is recommended. 

562. For the Erysipelas. 
Take three ounces of sarsaparilla root, two of burdock 
root, three of the bark of sweet ozier, two of cumfrey root, 
two of the bark of the root of bittersweet, three of prince's 
pine, two of black alder bark, and two handfuls of low mal- 
lows leaves, and put all in four quarts of pure, soft, water ; 
steep half away; strain it; add half a pint of molasses, and 
four ounces of good figs, and boil the mixture ten or fifteen 
minutes.' Strain it again. When cold, add one pint o. 
Holland ^in. Take a wineglass three times a day.

563. Pitch-Pifie Mixture for the Consumption, 

Take two or three good sized pitch pine knots ; chip 
them fine ; put them into two quarts of pure, soft water , 
boil them in an iron vessel till reduced to one quart, skim 
ming off the turpentine as it rises ; -strain it through a thick 
cloth ; add a pint of molasses, or a pound of loaf sugar ; 
boil it in ; strain it again, into an earthen vessel ; add one 
gill of the best of Cogniac brandy, or such other spirit as 
may be preferred, and bottle it. Give from half a wine- 
glass to a full one, as the patient can bear it, three times a 
day. It is excellent for any cough. 

564. Cough Drops, 

Put in a vial, equal quantities of the tincture of bloodroot, 
balsam tolou, and of paregoric ; use, frequently, from ten to 
twenty drops — ^need not be particular to measure. 

565. Cough Tea. 

Make a strong tea of everlasting ; strain it ; put to a pint 
of it, an ounce of figs, or raisins, and an ounce of licorice 
cut in slips ; boil them in the tea about twenty minutes ; 
take it from the fire and add the juice of a lemon. This is 
an excellent remedy for a tight cough. It may be used 
freely. Most efficacious when hot. 

566. Cough Mixture. 

With twenty teaspoonfuls of honey, mix ten of brandy, 
sixty drops of laudanum, and forty drops of elixir vitriol. 
Take two or three teaspoonfuls of the mixture on going to 
bed ; and a teaspoonful any time after coughing. 

567. For a Cankered Mouth. 

Chew the root of crane's bill. A decoction of it is also 
good. A decoction of blackberry leaves, sweetened witli 
honey, and a little burnt alum added, may be used. 

568. Family Salve. 
Scrape yellow bar soap fine ; mix with it, brown sugar.

for old sores ; for such as have bad flesh ; and for general uie 

569. For Rheumatism^ Sprains and Bruises, 

Take a quart of spirits of wine, two ounces of laudanum, 
one ounce of oil of pennyroyal, and one ounce of oil of am- 
ber ; mix them and apply the mixture to thp part affected. 
The following is also good for the rheumatism. Put a gill 
of g3rmson seed into a pint bottle ; fill the bottle with the 
fine chips of a pitch pine knot ; then fi]l it with strong alco* 
hoi. In three days the virtue of the chips and of the seed 
will be extracted, the alcohol turning of a greenish color. 
Bathe the parts affected a few times, and it will destroy the 
pain. A decoction of wormwood, or the. bruised leaves, 
moistened and applied, is a good application for a bruise or 
sprain. 

570. For Lax Bowels, 

Take ten grains of salt of tartar, ten drops of laudanum, 
and twenty drops of the essence of peppermint, in warm 
water. Or, put to a gill of water a small tablespoonful of 
gum arabic, and two rolls ofprepared chalk of the size of a 
walnut, pulverized together. Shake it up well, and take a 
tablespoonful twice a day. 

571. For Stoppage of Urine.

half an ounce of rhubarb, and half an ounce of aloes. Mix 
them well, and take half a wineglass twice a day. 

572. For the Croup, 
Apply warmed spirits of turpentine. Put the spirits ot 
turpentine in a teacup : set the teacup in hot water ; wet 
flannels in it, and apply to the throat quite hot. Rub the 
feet and hands with it, instead of a flesh brush. Or, simmer 
garlics in pig's fbot oil, or lard ; rub it on the throat and 
stomach freely, and bind the garlics on the feet : — Or, most 
excellent : Bathe the feet in warm water immediately, rub- 
bing them well ; give a teaspoonful of skunk's oil if you 
have it, or pig's foot oil ; apply a thick paste of Scotch'^ 
snuff, moistened with sweet oil, pig's foot oil, or lard« to tho

parts affected, and bind hot garlic drafts on the feet. SnufF 
paste is excellent for removing acute pains from the side^ 
breast, &c. . 

573. For a Bum. 
Wash in lime water, and put on cotton batting moistened 
with linseed oil. 

574. For Inflamed Eyes — excellent. 

To a gill of best Madeira wine, add tKree ounces of lauda- 
num, two of tincture of myrrh, one of spirits of nitre, and 
five cloves. Put one drop every morning into the eye ; 
and if much inflamed, one drop on going to bed. 

575. For a Felon. 

Roast a lump of salt of the size of a walnut wrapped in 
a cabbage leaf, and pulverize it. Take the same quantity 
of shaving soap, and the same of bar soap, and make all 
into a yery smooth salve ; soak the felon in lye ; apply the 
salve ; in twenty-four hours, pare down where it looks like 
breaking, till you open it ; put on basilicon salve. 

576. For Cholera Morbus. 
Take two spoonfuls of pulverized rhubarb, two of cinna- 
mon, and two of loaf sugar ; wet them up with gin ; take a 
teaspoonful three times an hour, till the complaint is 
checked ; then less frequently. 

577. Elixir Propriatatis. 
Take one ounce of myrrh, one of aloes, half an ounce of 
saffron, a quarter of an ounce of rhubarb, and a quart of 
good spirits ; shake the mixture well and often, and keep 
it in a warm place, and you may use it in three days. 

578. Rice Gruel 

Put into six gills of boiling water a spoonful of rice, and 
d, little mace or cinnamon ; strain it when soft, adding half 
a pint of new milk ; and then boil it a few minutes longer 
with a teaspoonful of salt. 

To make the gruel of rice flour, mix a spoonful of it 
smootlily with three of cold water, and stir it into a quart 



REUBDIBS AND COOKERY FOR Tl SICR. 185 

of boiling water. Boil five or six minutes, stirring it con 
stantly. Season with a little salt and pepper, ad£ng nut« 
meg and loaf sugar if liked. 

579. Water Gruel ' 

Mix with one spoonful of wheat flour, two of Indian rneaU 
and cold water enough to make a thick batter. Stir it into 
a pint of boiling water, if the gruel is liked thick ; if thin, 
into more water ; boil about forty minutes, putting in a 
little salt and stirring it frequently. Take it off the fire, 
and add a little salt and butter, and pour it on small pieces 
of toasted bread. 

580. Barley Water, 

Boil till soft two ounces of barley in two quarts of water. 
Pearl barley is preferred. Strain and mix it with enough 
currant jelly to give it a pleasant taste. 

If the jelly is not preferred, turn the boiled barley^to two 
ounces of figs or raisins, and boil all till reduced to one 
quart ; strain and use it. 

581. Caudle. 
To rice or water gruel made as above and strained, add 
half a wineglass of wine, brandy, or ale ; and season it with 
loaf sugar and nutmeg. 

582. WinCy Vinegar, and other Wheys. 
Stir into a pint of boiling milk, two glasses of wine ; boil 
it one minute ; take it from the fire ; let it stand till the curd 
has settled ; then pour ofl' the whey, and sweeten it with 
loaf sugar. Vinegar, cream of tartar, lemon, mustard seed, 
and alum whey, are all made in like manner. 

583. Arrow Root Custard. 
Stir well into'a pint of boiling milk, a spoonful of arrow- 
root mixed smooth with a little cold milk ; boil it three or 
four minutes ; when cool, stir in two well-beaten eggs, 
sweeten it to the taste, and add a little nutmeg ; let all boiL 
up once, stirring constantly ; then take it quickly from the 
fire, and pour into custard cups. Omitting the sweetening, 
nutmeg, and eggs ; tlie arrow root, prepared as for custards 



186 REMEDIES AND COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 

18 exceuent food for invalids, and can be eaten when the 
custards are too rich for the stomach. 

584. Thoraughwort Bitters. 
Make a strong tea of thoroughwort ; strain it ; when 
cool, put to two quarts of it half a pint of French brandy, 
the peel of two or three fresh oranges, cut in small bits, and 
six bunches of fennel or smellage seed. Turn the tea and 
brandy on the peel and seed in a bottle, and cork it tight. 
The bitters will keep good a long time ; they are excellent 
for bilious complaints, and can often be taken when thor- 
oughwort tea will not suit the stomach. Put a wineglass 
of the bitters to a tumbler of water, adding a little sugar at 
the time of drinking them. 

585. Stomachic Tincture, 

Bruise one ounce of dried bitter orange peel, with two of 
Peruvian bark ; steep them two weeks in a pint of proof 
spirit, shaking up the bottle once or twice daily. Let it 
remain quiet two 4^ys, then turn it off carefully into another 
bottle. A teaspoonful, in a wineglass of water, is a good 
tonic. 

586. Tapioca Jelly. 

Rinse four spoonfuls of tapioca thoroughly, covering it 
with cold water ; soak it five hours. Put a pint of cold 
water on the fire ; when it boils, mash and_ stir up the 
tapioca that is in water, and mix it with the boiling water ; 
simmer all gently with a stick of cinnamon or mace ; when 
thick and clear, mix two spoonfuls of white sugar with half 
a spoonful of lemon juice, and half a glass of white wine ; 
stir it into the jelly ; add more sugar, if not sweet enough, 
and turn the jelly into cups. 

587. Moss Jelly. 
Steep Carragua or Irish moss in cold water a few min- 
utes, to extract its bitter taste ; turn off the water ; to half 
an ounce of moss add a quart of fresh water and a stick of 
cinnamon. Boil it till a thick jelly ; strain it, and season 
it to the taste with loaf sugar and white wine. This is 
highly recommencied for consumptive complaints, and is 
very nourishing 



REMEDIES AND COuKERV FOB THE SICK. 187 

588. Sago Jelly. 

Soak four ounces of sago in cold water half an hour, 
after thoroughly rinsed ; pour it off; turn on a pint and a 
half of fresh cold water ; soak it half an hour ; then boil it 
slowly with a stick of cinnamon, stirring it constantly. 
When of a thick consistency, add a glass of wine, and loaf 
sugar to the taste. Boil it five minutes, and turn it into 
cups. 

589. Beef Tea, 

Boil a pound of fresh lean beef ten minutes ; cut it in 
small bits ; pOur on a pint of boiling water ; let it steep, 
where warm, half an hour ; then strain and season the tea 
with salt and pepper. This, though a quick way, is not so 
good as the following, when the stomach can bear but a 
little liquid ; — Cut the beef, quite free o{ fat, into small bits ; 
fill a junk bottle with them, cork it tight, immerse it in a 
kettle of lukewarm water, and boil it four or five hours. 
In this way, you obtain the juices of the meat unalloyed 
with water. A spoonful of this, is as nourishing as a tea- 
cup of the other. 

590. For the Dysentery. 
Bruise one ounce of rhubarb, two drachms of English 
8affron,^two of cardamom seed, and a large nutmeg ; add to 
them a pint of best French brandy ; set the bottle, loosely 
corked, in a pot of cold water ; heat the water over a mod- 
erate fire quite hot, and keep it hot twelve hours, without 
boiling. It is then fit for use. Take, on going to bed, one 
spoonful — a teaspoonful for a child. 

591. For Weakness. 
Put to a pint of best port wine, one ounce of steel filings? 
and one ounce of cinnamon. Place the bottle twenty-four 
hours in the corner, often shaking it : — take in the day, 
three teaspoonfuls, one at a time. 

592. To prevent the Lockjaw. 

As this is often caused by treading on a nail or pin, and 

subsequent neglect — forthwith bind on a rind of salt pork. 

If the foot swell, bathe it in strong wormwood tea, and bind 

on another pork rind :~rest till healed. Or, soak the limb

fell in warm lye, and apply a hot Indian meal poultice^ 
^et with lye. Renew it when cold. 

593. Far the Ear Ache. - 
As this is generally caused by a cold — steam the ear oreT 
iot herbs, bathe the feet, and put cotton wool wet with 
iweet oil and paregoric into the ear. Or, best and safest; 
put the heart of a roasted onion, warpi, into the ear, bathing 
the feet, and applying drafts. 

594. Infallible Cure for the Tooth Ache, 

Pulverize and mix in equal quantities, alum and common 
salt ; wet a small piece of cotton, and causing the mixture 
to adhere, place it in the hollow tooth. A sensation of cold- 
ness will be produced at first,'which will gradually subside, 
and with it, the torment of the tooth ache. As an approx 
imation to a cure, apply a ginger poultice, on flannel, when 
going to bed. Some recommend the wetting of the flannel 
in hot vinegar. Hot vinegar applications are' efficacious for 
removing pains in variety ; but they are hazardous. Very 
serious results have been caused by the application of vin- 
egar. If used at all, use it with the greatest caution. 

595. For the Sick Head Ache, 
Every other night, for a while, soak the -feet on going to 
bed, in hot water half an hour, adding hot water occasion- 
ally during thf time, so as to have the water hotter at the 
time of taking them out than when putting them in, to pre- 
vent the blood rushing back to the head. Retiring imme- 
diately, drink a tumbler of hot strong ginger tea, and apply 
a stone jug of hot water to the feet. Some recommend the 
application of a hop poultice to the head, and the use of this 
prescription at any hour of the day. 

596. For the Heart-ache or Heart'Iurn. 

For the one, keep a conscience void of offense :* for the 
other chew magnesia or chalk, or drink a tumbler of cold 
milk. 

597. Iceland Liverwort, 

Take one ounce and free it of all dust and alloy, by rub-

bing it in cold water ; cover it with cold water, and stoep it 
two hours ; then bruise or cut it, and turn on boiling water, 
and steep it three or four days, and turn off the water by 
pressure. Put the livefwort into a quart of fresh water, and 
reduce it by boiling to about a pint. After strained and 
cooled, it is free from any bitter taste, and makes a thick 
mucilage. It is palatable, by adding sugar and lemon acid, 
or white wine, where wine may be used ; and it is an excel- 
lent demulcent nutriment in dysentery, consumption, . and in 
convalescence from acute diseases, especially aifter the 
hooping cough, in which case its bitter need be but partiaUy 
extracted. 

598. Bread Water, 

Brown^ thoroughly thin pieces of bread on both sides, 
without burning it, and turn boiling water over it and let 
it cool. 

699. Cooling Drinks, 

Turn boiling water on preserves, roasted sour apples, or 
lemons sliced ; or boil lemon juice in sugar and water. 

600. Licorice, Flax-seed, BonesH, Pennyroyal, Mint, Balm, 

and other Teas, 

Put the seeds or herbs into a pitcher ; turn on boiling 

water ; cover and set it near the fire till sufficiently strong. 

. Mint tea is good for allaying nausea and vomiting. Seep, 194. 

601. For a Cut. 

For a slight cut, only put on dry linen lint, bandaging it 
moderately tight. Uniting the lips with an adhesive plas- 
ter, or by stiching, will make a cut heal more readily. In 
slight cuts, the lint need not be removed. In others, after 
two or three days, a plaster of basilicon, or some other 
salve may be needed. Apply the salve, spread on lint, or 
a fine rag, directly ; or over a thin dressing of dry lint. 

" 602. Madder Red, and Crimson Dyes 
For one pound of goods, allow three ounces of alum, one 
of cream of tartar, and eight of madder. Bring to a scald- 
ing heat, three gallons of water in a brass kettle : i^dd the 



190. COMMON DYES. 

alum and tartar ; let it boil ; then put in the goods, and boil 
them two hours. Take out and rinse them in clear water. 
Empty the kettle ; put in again three gallons of water ; add 
the madder ; (it may be tied up in a bag) rub it fine in the 
water ; put in the goods, and let them remain one hour in 
the dye, which must not boil, but be kept at a scalding heat. 
Keep the goods in motion, and when they have been in one 
hour, let Uiem boil ^ve minutes ; then take them out, stir 
and rinse them out well, without wringing, and dry them in 
the shade. For a crimson dye, take for each pound of 
goods, two and a half ounces of alum, and an ounce and an 
half of white tartar ; put them in a brass kettle with water 
enough to cover the goods ; boil them briskly a few min- 
utes ; then put in the goods, washed clean and rinsed in 
fair water. When the goods have boiled half an hour, take 
them out without wringing, and hang them where they will 
cool all over alike, without drying ; empty out the alum and 
tartar water ; put fresh water in the kettle, and for each 
pound of goods, put in an ounce of cochineal, powdered 
fine. After the water has boiled fifteen or twenty minutes, 
reduce it to a lukewarm temperature, by adding cold water ; 
then put in the goods and boil them an hour and a quarter. 
Take them out without wringing, and dry them in the 
shade. Balm of Gilead blossoms, steeped in fair water, 
then strained, make a pretty red dye for silks. The silk 
must be free of color, washed clean, rinsed, and boiled in 
the strained dye, with a small lump of alum. For faded 
fancy shawls and ribbons, use a carmine saucer, to color a 
fine delicate pink ; the directions come with the saucers. 

603. Blue Black Dye. 
Wet in strong suds a pound of goods, and wring them 
dry ; put into a thin cloth bag a pound of ground logwood, 
and put this into sufficient vinegar or sour cider, to cover 
the goods, and hang it where it will keep warm several 
hours, boiling it a few minutes at the last. Put in your 
goods, and let them remain in the dye two or three days, 
mtkout boiling, airing them daily. Take your goods out of 
the warm dye, spread them evenly in the shade to dry, and 
then wash them out in strong suds. 



COMMON DVES. 191 

604. Black Bye. 

Take for a pound of goods a pound of logwood. Soak 
tlie logwood in soft water over night ; boil it an hour, and 
strain the water. Allow for each pound of logwood aa 
ounce of blue vitriol ; dissolve the vitriol in enough luke- 
warm water to wet the goods ; dip the goods in ; when sat- 
urated, turn the whole into the logwood dye. If the goods 
are cotton, place the vessel on the fire, and let the goods 
boil ten or fifteen minutes, stirring them constantly to pre- 
\rent their spotting. For silk and woolen goods, do not boil 
the dye stuff. Only keep it at a scalding heat for twenty 
minutes. Drain the goods without wringing, and hang them 
in a shady, but dry airy place. When dry, put the goods 
into scalding water, with one teacup of salt to three gallons 
of the water. Let the goods be in it till cold, then hang 
them to dry, without wringing. Boiling hot suds is the best 
thing to set the color of black silk ; let it be in till cold 
Sour milk is good to soak goods in, to set a black dye. 

605. Slate Colored "Dye, 
Boil sugar-loaf paper with vinegar, in an iron vessel, 
adding alum to set the color. This makes a good dark 
slate color. Tea grounds, set with copperas, also. For a 
light slate color, boil in a brass vessel, white maple bark in 
clear water, adding a little alum. The dye for slate color 
should be strained before putting in the goods. They 
should be boiled in it ; then hung out to drain and dry. 

606. Yellow Dyes. 
For a buff color, boil equal parts of common potash and 
anatto in pure soft water. When dissolved, take it from 
tho fire ; put in the goods when cool, first washed free from 
spots and color ; place them on a moderate fire, where the 
goods will keep hot till of the shade desired. To dye 
orange or salmon color, tie anatto in a bag, and soak it m 
warm so^ soap suds, till so soft you can squeeze enough 
of it thrnu.gh the bag to make the suds a deep yellow. Put 
in the articles clean and free of color, and boil them till of 
the shade you wish. Have sufficient dye to cover the 
goods, &> .d stir them while boiling to keep them from spo^ 



192 COMBiON DY£S. 

trnf. ^This dye will make a salmon or orange color, ac- 
cording to the strength of it, and the time the goods remain 
in. Drain them out of the dye, and dry them quickly in 
the sliade ; then wash them in soft soap suds. Goods dyed 
in this manner should never be rinsed in clear water. 
Peach leaves, fustic, and saffron, all make good straw ox 
lemon color, according to the strength of the dye. They 
should be steeped in sod fair water, in tin or earthen, and 
then strained, the dye set with alum, and a little gum-arabic 
dissolved in 'the dye, if you want to stiffen the article. 
When the dye stuff is strained, steep the articles in it. 

607. Green and Blue Dye for SUks and Woolens. 
To dye green, take a pound of oil of vitriol, and pour it 
on half an ounce of Spanish indigo, that has been reduced 
to a fine powder. Stir them well together ; add a pea- 
sized lump of salsratus, bottle it as soon as fermentation 
ceases, and you may use it next day. Make chemic blue 
in the same manner, using only half the quantity of vitriol. 
For woolen goods the East indigo answers as well as the 
Spanish, and is cheaper. This dye will not do for cotton 
goods, as the vitriol rots the threads. Wash the articles 
to be colored perfectly clean and free from color. If the 
color cannot be extracted by rubbing in hot suds, boil out 
and rinse in soft water, till entirely free from soap, as the 
soap will spoil the dye. To dye a pale color, put to each 
quart of soft warm water that is to be used for the dye, ten 
drops of the above composition. To dye a deeper color, 
add more. Put in the articles without crowding, and let 
them remain in till sufficiently dyed. Keep the dye warm ; 
take the articles out without wringing, drain as diy as pos- 
sible, then hang them to dry in a shady airy place. They 
should be dyed in dry weather. Unless dried quick, they 
will not look nice. When perfectly dry, wash them in 
lukewarm suds, to prevent injury of the texture by the vit- 
riol. If you wish a lively bright green, mix a little of the 
above composition with yellow dye. 

608. Beautiful Pink Dye. 
Take three parts cream of tartar, and one of cochineah 
nicelv rubbed together. Tie a teaspoonful in a muslin bsig ; 



SOAPS. 19S 

put this with a quart of boiling water ; dip in the articles 
to be colored, previously cleaned and dipped in ^om water. 
If wished stiff put, in a little gum-arabic. 

609. ColdSoc^. 

Mix twenty-six pounds of melted and strained grease, 
with four pailfuls of lye, made of twenty pounds of white 
potash. Let the whole stand in the sun, stirring it fre- 
quently. In the course of the week, fill the barrel with 
weak lye. It is much easier than to make a lye of your 
ashes ; while quite as cheap, if you dispose of your ashes 
to the soap boiler. 

610. Hard Soap, 

Dissolve twenty pounds of white potash in three pailfuls 
of water. With twenty pounds of strained hot grease, mix 
the dissolved potash, and boil them till a thick jelly, which 
is ascertained by examining a little of it taken out and 
cooled. Take it off the fire, stir in cold water till it grows 
thin, then add to each pailful a pint of blown salt, stirring 
it well. Next day remove the lye, and heat it over a slow 
fire ; boil fifteen minutes, and take it off. Put in a little 
palm oil if you wish the soap of a yellow color, and pour 
it into wooden vessels. When cold separate it froin the 
lye again, and cut it into bars. Place them in the sun a 
few days to dry. 

611. Windsor Soap. 

To make the celebrated Windsor soap, — slice the best 
white bar soap as thin as possible, and melt it over a slow 
fire ; then take it off, and when lukewarm, add sufficient 
oil of caraway to scent it, or any other fragrant oil. Pour 
it into moulds, and let it remain ^ye or six days in a dry 
place. 

612. Bayherry^ or Myrtle Soap, 

Dissolve two pounds four ounces of white potash in five 
quarts of water ; mix with it ten pounds of bayberry tallow ; 
boil all over a slow fire till it turns to soap ; add a teacup 
of cold water ; boU it ten minutes longer ; turn it info tin 
moulds for a week or ten days to dry, first scenting it with 
any essential oil that may be preferred. It may be used in

Put into your soap barrel, sixteen pounds of clean grease , 
sixteen of good potash ; and a pail of boiling water. Stir 
it thorougMy ; and add, daily stirring it several times, a 
pailful of cold or warm water every day, till full. 

614. Cosmetic Soap, for tDoshing the hands. 
Take a pound of castile soap, or any other nice old soap ; 
scrape it fine ; put it on the fire with a little water ; stir it 
to a smooth paste ; turn it into a bowl ; when cold, add 
some lavender water, or any kind of essence : beat it with 
a silver spoon till well mixed ; thicken it with Indian meal, 
and keep it in small pots, closely covered ; exposure to the 
air will harden it. 

615. Superior Soft Soap. 

Cut in small pieces, a pound and a half of bar soap, into 
four quarts of rain water ; add four ounces of pure carbon- 
ate of soda ; dissolve them over the fire, and when dissolve(l« 
stir in one spoonful of salt : — very ni^e for woolens and 
calicoes. 



6l5t a. Potato-Yeast Bread. 

Put into the usual quantity of yeast for four loaves, eight boiled 
mealy potatoes, mashed fine, adding enough water to make the 
whole of yeast-consistency ; let it stand all night, where a little 
warm ; and then rub it through a colander into your flour — much 
improves the bread. 

615, *. Chicken Tea, 
Take off the skin and fat ; cut the fowl in small pieces, and 
boil it till very tender, adding a little salt. Some boil, with it, a 
little wheat flour tied in a muslin bag. Skim off the fat, if any, 
when done. . q^^^ ^^ 

MoUuseSf for all kinds of cooking, is much improved by boiling 
and skimming. ^^^ ^ 

' Use none but a silver spoon for Stvectmeats — dip, with it, your 
jellies, while bulling, iiilo glaose^ aiiJ iiiuuldo.

616. To extract Tar J Paint, Grease, and Stains from Carpets, 
and the finest fabrics, without injury to the texture, or to the 
most delicate colors, — 
Wet soft linen in camphine, and rub the soiled spot till restored ; or, foi 

•omc articles, rub on beaten egg-yelk, dry in the sun, and wash. 

617. To preserve different kinds of Fruit through the Winter, 
Take hard sound apples ; wipe them dry, pack them in tight barrels, put- 
ting a layer of bran to each of apples, so as not to let the apples touch each 
other, and you may keep them till June. Keep the barrel m a cool place, 
enveloped in a linen clotn, to prevent the apples freezing. Some lay mortar 
orer the top of a barrel of apples to preserve them. It draws the air from 
thom, and thus prevents their decay. Do not let the mortar touch the apples. 
Lemons and oranges may be kept some months, by wrapping such as are per- 
fectly fresh in separate soft papers, and securing them in glass jars, or per- 
fectly tight boxes, packed in white sand dried several hours in the oven after 
baking. Cover each thickly^ then cover the whole so. Close the vessel 
tight, and keep it in a cool dry place. To keep grapes, pick them on a dry 
day before quite dead ripe, reject the bad ones, lay the bunches in a glass 
jar, sprinkle round each a thick layer of dry bran so they shall not touch each 
other, put a thick layer on the top, and cork and seal the jar. By cutting oft 
the extreme end of the stems, on eating them, and placing the stems in sweet 
wine a few minutes, they will so imbibe the wine as to restore the grapes to 
their formci freshness. To keep green grapes, gooseberries, currants, and 
plums, through the winter, fill junk bottles with the fruit, set them in an oven 
six or seven hours after baking ; when the fruit has shrunk, take from one 
bottle to fill the others quite AiU. Cork and seal tight. To make pies of 
them, put them in a tin pan, cover them with boiling water, stew soft, and 
sweeten them. To keep ripe whortleberries and blackberries, dry them per- 
fectly in the sun, and tie them in bags thick enough to exclude the air. Treat 
them like the green fruit when used. Ripe currants dried on the stem, pick- 
ed off, and put in bags, will keep good for pies all winter. They make a nice 
tea for fevers, especially the hectic. They are excellent to counteract the 
effects of opium. 

018. To make Tomato Ketchup, and to keep Tomatoes and Lima 

Beans through the Winter. 

To one gallon of skinned tomatoes, put four spoonfuls of salt, four of black 

pepper, three of mustard, half a spoonful of allspice, and eight pods of red 

pcpi^er. Ail the ingredients shoulci be made fine, and simmered slowly in a 



196 VISCSLLANB0U8 RECEIPTS. 

pewter bMin, in sufficient sharp vinegar to have two quarts of ketchup after 
simmering it three or four hour;! and straining it through a wire sieve. Those 
who like it may add two spoonfuls of the juice of garlic, after the simmering 
is over, and the ingredients are somewhat cooled. 

This is superior to West India Ketchup, is an excellent remedy for dis- 
pepsia, may he used in a week, but improves much by age. 

Smooth ripe tomatoes may be kept iresh through the winter, by packing in 
iiT sand ana keeping them in a cool dry place. 

Fack Lima beans in a cask, with alternate layers of fine salt ; put a weight 
on them, cover and keep them where cool and dry. The later the pods are 
gathered the better. 

619. Lemon Citron, 
Turn water on nice fresh lemon peels, soak them till you can scru>e aL 
the white pulp off, then boil them till soft. Preserve them with halt their 
weight of sugar. They are a good substitute for citron. 

620. Tarragon Vinegar. 

Pick the tarragon nicely from the stems ; let it lay m a dry place two days, 
to a quart of the leaves put in a pitcher, turn three pints ot vinegar ; after 
standing a week, closely covered, strain it; and when clear, bottle, and coik 
it close. 

621, A Cheap Water Filter, 

Lay a thick bed of pounded charcoal on the bottom of a large common 
earthen flower-pot, and over this lay a bed of fine sand about four inches 
thick. 

622. To Prepare Rennet. 

Take the stomach of a calf as soon as slaughtered ; do not wash it ; hang 
It four or five days in a cool dry place, then turn it inside out, slipping off aU 
the curd with the hand ; put in sufficient salt with a little saltpetre, lay it in 
m small stone pot, turn on it ateaspoonful of vinegar, sprinkle over it a hand- 
ful of salt, and cover it tight. In six or eieht weeks, cut off a piece four 
inches square, put it in a vessel that will hold a pint and a half, add five gills 
of cold water, and one of rose brandy, stop it close, and shake it when about 
to use it. A spoonful is enough for a quart of milk. Well prepared, in cool 
weather, it will keep more than twelve months. Add, if necessarjr, more 
water and salt, as you diminish it. For cooking, it is nicer if wine is sub- 
stituted for the vinegar and water. The more common way is, to empty the 
stomach of its curd immediately after the calf is slaughtered, to thorough^ 
salt it inside and out, and to let it lay ir salt one day, and then to stretch it 
on a stick to dry. When dry lay it anay, and use a little bit as wanted. 

623. To clean Calfs Head and Feet. See page 15. 

624. To Com Beefy and to " Salt %n Snow.'^ 
Put to each gallon of cold water one quart of rock salt, one ounce of salt- 
petre, and four ounces of brown sugar — (you need not boil it)-^d put in 
your beef. As long as any salt remains undissolved, the meat will be sweet. 
If any scum rise, scald and skim the brine, and add more salt, saltpetre, and 
sugar. Rub a piece of meat over with a little salt, on putting it into the 
brine. If the weather is hot, gash the piece to the bone| anq put in salt. Put 
a flat stone or some weight on the meat, to keep it\tnder brine, and cover the 
cask. Or thus, allowing to every four gallons of water two pounds of brown 
fug^ and six pounds of salt, boil it about twenty minutes, taking off the scum 
as it rises. The next day turn it on your meat packed in the pickling tub. 
Pour off this brine, boil and skim it every two months, adding three ounces 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 197 

if brown sugar and half a pound of common salt. It will keep good a year. 
Sprinkle the meat with salt, and the next day wipe it diy, before turning 
the pickle over it. Let it entirely cover the meat ; add four ounces of salt- 

Setre. Place canvas lids over your salting tubs, to admit the air and exclude 
ies. For immediate use and for soup, you need only thoroughly rub voor 
pieces of beef or mutton with dry salt, placing them in a closely covered tub 
and turning them daily. You may thus keep mutton and beef sweet six or 
eight weeks. 

" Salting m maw : — cover the bottom of a laige clean tub four inches, with 
nice snow ; lay in your spare-ribs, fowls, &c., cover each layer two or three 
inches, taking special care to fill snow into eveiy crack and cranny b^twcAn 
Ihe ineces and next the tub, and stuffing the fowls with snow, and topping 
•ff with a layer of snow tight pressed down. Cover your tub, and the colder 
its location the better. The meat will remain as fresh and juicy as when 
first killed. It will not freeze. The snow will not melt, unless there come 
a January thaw. 

C25. To Salt Pork. 
Pork is said not to be so good for salting for having been kept fat all sum 
mer. Cover the bottom of your barrel with coarse salt. Rock salt is the 
best. Put in your meat skin side down, putting a good layer of salt over each 
piece. If salted in* the evening after it is slaughtered, it will pack closei 
than after stiffening by long laying. Make sufficient strong brine to quite 
cover the meat — (if not covered it will be rusty) — by dissolving salt in cold 
water till completely saturated. Boil and skim the brine ; then turn it on 
cold, first putting on a weight to keep the meat compact under brine. Always 
let there be undii3solved salt in your pork barrel. What is left will be as 
food as new for the next year. If washed, nothing can be better for butter. 

626. Westphalia Hams — mode of curing them* 
Hang up your hams ten or twelve days — (the longer the tenderer and bet- 
ter if kept perfectly sweet)— 7then mix, for a common sized ham, a teacup of 
blown salt, a teacup of molasses, and one ounce of saltpetre ; lay the hams 
in a clean dry tub, rub them all over with the mixture, and rub the bone ef- 
fectually. Turn and rub Uie hams daily, for three weeks, occasionally rub- 
bing on a little blown salt. Nothing can be better if rightly smoked. Use 
com cobs for smoking. Hickory and apple-tree wood are good. Do not heat 
your hams. 

627. Virginia Mode of Curing Hams. 

Add salt to water so long as it will dissolve ; for every sixteen pounds of 
ham, add to your pickle two teaspoonfuls of salaeratus, and two ounces of 
saltpetre, adding also a gallon of molasses to every hogshead of brine. Let 
the name lie in this pickle three or four weeks, • Smoke them from one to 
three months. To retain the juices, smoke with the hock downwards. 

628. Western Mode of Curing Hams. 

Let the hams remain as for " Westphalia Hams,'' so long as they will keop 
sweet, after the pork is cut out ; then rub around the bone of each ham a 
teaspoonful of saltpetre, and pack them in fine salt, half a bushel to five hun 
dred weight. Let them lay one month. (If they settle, they are doing well. 
If they rise, take them up, and add more salt.) Then taking them out, rub 
with the hand all over the fleshy part of the ham, a paste made of good ashes 
wet up with water— thus prepared, the flies will not trouble them. Smoka 
them, hock downwaids. 

629. A Cheap Smoke House. 
TtkiB a barrel or hogshead, and knock out both heads, and smoke your n tat 



198 MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 

«r fiah in k. Be careful of yoar fire. Pat a few embers in a saitable Teasel, 
*ay on them a few cobs ; the cobs may occasionally be sprinkled with water; 
suspend your meat from sticks laid across the cask, covering it so as to con- 
fine the smoke, but not to extinguish the fire. A red hot bar, covered with 
sawdust or green wood may be used. 

630. To Pickle Salmon. 
Put a laree half pint of vinegar to a quart of liquor the fish has been boiled 
in, and hdf an ounce of whole black pepper — ^boil it, and pour it cold over ths 
fish, laid in a deep dish — a good wav to dress the salmon after a dinner. T« 
boil a salmon on purpose to pickle, it keeps better for not being scaled. 
Pour a little sweet oil over the top of the pickle, and the salmon will keep 
good for months. 

631. To Pickle Shad, 

With a peck of rock salt and two quarts of blown, mix a pound of sugar 
and four ounces of saltpetre ; allow this preparation for every twenty-five 
shad. Put a layer of this at the bottom of your barrel, then a layer of well- 
cleaned shad, with the skin down ; then another layer of salt, sugar, and 
saltpetre, and thus till you get in all the shad. Place a smooth flat stone ox 
some heavy weight on the shad, to keep them under brine. If in the course 
of a week the juice of the shad do not make sufficient brine to cover them, 
add a little brine. 

632. To Cure Herring, 

Where-the location will admit of it ; for family use, take your beef brine 
which is left of your winter's stock, to the fishing place ; select the largest, 
and throw them in alive — (the brine they drink before they die, has a wonider- 
ful effect in preserving their juices.) Let them remain twenty-four hours; 
take them out, and lay them in a sloping position to drain, then pack them in 
a barrel till full, with coarse alum salt and saltpetre, in alternate layers of 
salt and fish, beginning with a layer of coarse alum salt, and taking care not 
to bruise the fish. Be liberal with your salt In a few weeks, if they are not 
covered with brine, make some and add. Put a cover over them, and a weight 
to keep them under brine. When a year or two old, they are not inferidt to 
anchovies 

633. An Excellent Common Pickle for Hams and Tongues, 
Allow for each gallon of water a pound and a half of salt, a pound of brown 
su^r or molasses, an ounce of saltpetre, and an ounce of allspice ; scald, 
skim, and cool it* Turn it on the meat, the meat first having been rubbed 
over with fine salt and lain two days. Let the meat remain in the pickle from 
two to four weeks, turning it daily. Canvas or coarse calico bags are good 
for keeping meat after it is smoked. Dip the bags several times in strong 
brine, and dry them before putting it in, or pot it in and then whitewasa 
the bags. 

634. To Try Lard and Tallow. 
Lard tries easier the day the pork is butchered. It need not then be wash 
ed, except where stained. Cut it into pieces ; put it in an iron pot with a 
very little water to prevent burning ; bod it slowly over a moderate fire, stir- 
ring it occasionally to prevent burning, till the. scraps are quite brown ; strain 
it tnrou^ a coarse cloth, spread over a colander, into your lard tub— what 
you want for your nicest without squeezing the strainer — ^then squeeae the 
scraps as dry as possible. Use the last strained first, as it will not keep so 
long as the first. Keep your lard covered in a cool dry place. Some salt the 
'ard while trying, others do not. The latter keeps equally well with the 
saited. The -scraps are nice for eating. Tallow is tned in the same way. 
U i^uld lie where perfectly cool and (uy several days, and be sticred bvibre 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 199 

tryinjS* Some prefer having the lard lay a day or two before trying it It 
tfboald then be washed thoroughly in cold water. The leave* make the 
nicest lard. 

635. To Manage Bees, 

The best mode known to the writer, is to make the bees a convenient snug 
little bed-room near your own. In the end of your d^'elling-h(>use, or in any 
of your but-buildings, make them a room with a number of shelves, having a 
door for entry at pleasure ; place a hive on one of th^ shelves'; on the top of 
this hive, or at its side, place another, or a box, into which the bees can pass 
from the main hive, and which may be removed when full. They will sus* 
pend the comb to the shelves when all else is full. Make an opening through 
the outside of the building for the convenience of the bees ^ing in and out. 
Among others, the writer would take the liberty of refernng to a Mr. Bra- 
man, of Worcester, Mass. as having a good apiary of the kind described. 8ee 
others also in Chester. In this way there is but little danger of a colony's 
being robbed on account of their weakness. As these little fellows are occa> - 
sionuly pugnacious, and seem impelled by a kind of simultaneous nimily 
impulse to make an assault upon their peaceable neighbors, the assailants 
may be identified at their own homes, by the sprinklmg a little flour over 
them while in the act of robbery and murder abroad. But it is beyond the 
art of man to mediate a truce. You must either take up the hive attacked* 
or submit to its being plundered, and its inhabitants made prisoners of war. 
The chance for the assailants to fall, on the battle field, is small. 

636. To Make Cream. 

Mix two tcaspoonfuls of flour, the well beaten yolks of two eggs, and a lea- 
spoonful of sugar, and turn on gradually a pint of boiling milk, stirring con- 
stantly to prevent lumps. A very small bit of nice butter is sometimes added. 
Or, for coffee, beat the white of an egg to a froth, adding a small bit of butter, 
and turn the coffee to it gradually, that it may not curdle. Its taste is very 
similar to that of fresh cream. 

637. Yeast of Cream of Tartar and SdUBratus. 
Heat your oven ; mix two tcaspoonfuls of crsam of tartar with one quart 
of flour, then dissolve one teaspoonful of salseratus in warm water, and mix 
it with the flour, adding water enough to make it soft dough. — As soon as 
thoroughly kneaded, place it in your oven until sufficiently baked, and the 
bread will be tender and of the nicest kind. Biscuit may be made in tlie 
\ way bv adding a little shortening. 



638. Tartaritc Acid Yeast, 
Tartaric acid may be used in all cases for cooking, where an acid is 
wanted. It imparts no other taste than that of pure acidity. In connection 
with sdasratus or soda, it makes a very quick and convenient yeast, for 
raising bread and biscuit of all kinds ; for crust ; and for griddle cakes. 
Use equal quantities of each. For doughy put in a teaspoonful of salseratus 
toa<}uait o? flour. Then mould it up, putting in a teaspoonful of the acid. 
Let It stand fifteen or twenty minutes, and bake. For griddle cakesj stir in 
equsJ proportions of salaeratus and acid, putting in the acid last, andimme 
diately before cooking. 

639. Gardener Flour Pudding. 
Put a pint and a half of flour in a pan ; add four well beaten eggs, a quart 
of milk, and two tcaspoonfuls of salt. Beat all together till thorou^y 



203 MISCELLANEOUS PCCEIPTS. 

mixed : b«|; it and boil an hour and a half. For sance, take a teaciip of 
aogai half a gill of wine, and abuttemut-siae piece of butter, adding ahttla 
nutmeg. 

640. Whortleberry Pudding. 
Allow a quart of berries to sixteen spoonfuls of flour ; wash and spread 
the berries m a dish, gradually stir in half the flour, taking care not to maah 
the berries, break in two eegs, add a teaspoonful of s^t, and the remainder 
of the flour, and milk enough to make a batter as thick as for pancakes. Put 
it in a bag well floured into boiling water, and boil it an hour and a quarter. 

641. Custard Pudding. 
Take a quart of milk, eight eggs, and eighteen spoonfuls of flour. Take 
enough of the milk to wet up smooth the flour; turn on the remainder grad- 
ually, stirring it constantly, and if boiling hot the better ; add the eggs well 
beaten when a little cool, and a little salt, and stir all well together. Bake 
from twenty to thirty minutes. 

642. To Fricassee Eggs. 
Boil six eggs Ave minutes ; lay them in cold water, peel them carefully, 
dredge them lightly with flour, beat one egg perfectly light, dip in the hard 
e^;8, roll them in bread crums, seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmef, 
covering them well, then letting them stand awhile to dry ; fry them in bou- 
ing Isrd, and serve them up with any kind of rich well-seasoned gravy, and 
garnish with crisped parsley. 

643. Cold Sweet Sauce for Puddings. 
Rub equal quantities of butter and sugar to a cream, add a little wine, 
fonn it into a himp, set it in a cool place for fifteen minutes, then grate nut 
meg over iu Currant jelly may be substituted for the wine 

644. Buckwheat Cakes. 
Turn on to three cups of flour nnd a teaspoonful of salt, enough hot water 
to jpoke a thin batter. When lukewarm, add a spoonful of yeast, and set it 
in a^ wann place to rise. In the morning add a teaspoonful of salasratua in a 
teacup of hot water. If mixed in the evening, and it rise too fast, set the 
batter in a cool place through the night. Some of the same batter may ba 
reserved for the next time. 

645. Cheap Mountatn Pound Cake. 
To one egg and four ounces of butter, well beaten together ; add a tea- 
spoonful of fdlspice ; half a teaspoonful of pepper ; pint of molasses ; tea- 
spoonful 9f salasratus, dissolved in a teacup of creantj or milk ; and flour 
enough to make the consistency of fritters ; set it where quite warm to rise , 
and when peifectly light, bake moderately. 

646. Noodles for Soup. 

Thicken two eggs with flour, addins a little salt, till stiff enough to roll 
dut like pie crust ; sift flour over it ; do up the sheet in folds, sifting flour 
over each ; then shave it into very fine strings, and boil them in your soup 
fifteen minutes. 

647. To Clarify Sugar. 

Put to three pounds of sugar a pint of water ; add the white of one egg 
well beaten and mixed with half a pint of water. Boil all till the scum rises, 
4et it off Uie fire till it falls, then skim it.

048. To make Wheat Starch. 
Wasli a peck of good pure wheat ; cover it with water in a tub plar«(l ui 
he sun : change the water daily to, prevent its unpleasant smell; whtm ih« 
wheat becomes very soft, rub it out in water, throw the husks into another 
tub, let the white substance settle, turn off the water, put on fresh, stir it 
well, and let it settle ; do this daily, till the water turns off perfectly clear. 
Put the starch in a bag, and set it in the sun a few days ; then take it out, 
and dry it on platers. 

649. To make Potato Starch. 
Wash perfectly clean half a bushel of nice potatoes, grate them, wash the 
pulp thoroughly, rinsing and straining it through a sieve ; stir it well, and turn 
off the water after the starch has settled. Add new water ; next day stir 
well, let settle, and turn off the water again, and thus till the water turns oS 
clear, adding a little bluing to the last. Collect and dry the starch. 

650. To prepare Starch for Use. 

Wet your starch gradually with cold water till it will readily pour, rubbing 
it perfectly smooth with a spoon ; stir it into boiling water, and let it boil five 
or six minutes, frequently stirring it; stir in a little spermaceti, or stir it 
with a caudle ; strain and use it. 

Poland starch is made in the same manner. Muslins, to loqk clear and 
nice, should be clapped dry while the starching is hot, then folded in a rerv 
damp doth till quite damp before ironing. Isinglass is^ a very delicate starch 
for fine mucins ; also nee. Some add a very little fine salt to starch. 

651. White Apple Sauce. See Nos. 503 and 515. 
Pare and quarter tart apples ; put to them enough water to prevent their 
bmning, and boil till perfectly tender. Sweeten with sugar, and season wiUi 
grated lemon, mace, or nutmeg. 

652. Opodeldoc. 
Put into a pint of the spirits of wine, two ounces of camphor and a cake of 
Windsor soap sliced tine ; put all in a quart cup, cover close and set it in 
boiling water, and let it remain till they are dissolved. 'Add two ounces of 
the oil of origanum, and, when milk warm, a little salt 

653. Ox Marrow Pomade. See Nos. 722, 853. 
Simmer 10 ozs. ox-marrow. Strain it on lOozs. castor oil. Beat together 
till white as cream ; if for hours the better. Add ounce and half essential 
oils for perfume. Brandy and castor oil also good for the hair. 

654. To Preserve Herbs. 
Gather them on a dry day, just before blossoming ; suspend them, tied in 
bunches, in a dry airy place, with the blossom end downwards ; wrap the 
medicinal ones, when perfectly dry, in paper, and keep them from the air. 
Pound fine and sift the leaves of such as are to be used in cooking, and keep 
the powder in corked bottles. 

655. To preserve Vegetables throug\t}ie Winter. 
Keep succulent vpgretables in a damp, shady, cool place. Protect pota- 
toes, turnips, and similar vegetables from the air and fro^t, by burying them 
in sand. Potatoes will not sprout, it is said, if covered with charcoal dust 
It is also said that sweet potatoes will keep months thus,— packed in boxes 
of dry sand, exposed to the influences of smoke.

llis with m gallon of pore soft water, and stir in well, twelve omieet 
of ooanely-powdered Aleppo galls, six of chipped logwood, fire of protosol- 
phate of iron, five of gum-arabic, and two of diry Muscovado sugar. 

657. Indelible Ink for Marking, 
Dimolve two drachms of lunar-caustic and half an ounce of gum-arabic in 
a gill of rainwater ; dip the part to be marked in strong salaaratus water ; iron 
it quite smooth when dry ; mack and place it in the sun or near the fire to dry. 
Make marking red ink by reducing to a fine powdcrhalf an jounce of yennii- 
ion and a drachm of the salt of steel, and mixing them witn enough linseed 
oil to make the red ink of the same consistency as the black,

658. Black BaU. 
Melt together, slowly, ten ounces of bayberry tallow, five of beeswax, and 
one of mutton tallow. After melted, add enough ivory or lamp-black to give 
it when polished, a good black gloss. Stir all well together, and on tiding it 
irom the fire, add a glass of spirit. 

659. Liquid Blacking, 
Mix and stir well together four ounces of ivory-black, six gUls of vinegary 
two spoonfuls of molasses, and one of sweet oil.

For the Piles, roast, pulverize, and mix the 9ole of an old shoe with laid or 
ox marrow, and apply it. For Worms, brown, pulverize, and mix egg-shells 
with molasses. Uive teaspoon ful night and morning. 

661. Cement for Corked Bottles, 
Melt with four ounces of sealing-wax, four of rosin and two of bees* wax. 
Stir it with a tallow candle when it froths, and as soon as it melts, dip mto it 
the mouths of the corked bottles — it will make them air ti^ht. Some use two 
ounces of shellac, four of Spanish brown, and four of rosih. 

663. Cement for Broken Glass, China, or Earthenware, 
Rub the edges of the broken vessel with the beaten white of an egg ; tie 
finely powdered quicklime In a muslin bag, and sift it thick over the egg ; 
match and bind the pieces together, and let them remain bound several weeks. 
This is a cement for all kinds of crockery but thick heavy glass-ware, or coarse 
eaithen. The former cannot be cemented — for the latter use white paint. 
Paint the broken edges, match and bind them tight together, letting them 
x«main till the paint is dry and hard. Milk is a good cement. Match the 
pieces, bind them tight together, put the ware in cold milk, boil the milk half 
an hour, take it from the nre and let the crockery remain till the milk is cold. 
Keep the crockery bound several weeks. The Chinese mode of mending 
broken china is to grind fiint glass on a painter's stone, till it becomes an im- 
palpable powder, and then to beat it with the white of an e^ to a froth, and 
lay it on the broken edges, and match and bind them, and let them remain 
some weeks. It is said to be impossible to break the ware where thus 
cemented.

pnipose. This glae, made of the consistency of plastic clay, may be used 
for busts, models, basso-relieros, and like articles. They are susceptible of 
a high polish made of it. Poland starch is a fine cement for pasting bqreiB 
of paper or fancy articles. 

664. Alabaster Cement. 
Melt a pound of white bees' wax and a pound of rosin, and strew orer it 
gently three quarters of finely pulverized alabaster. Stir all well toeether, 
and knead it in water, to thoroughly incorporate the mass. The alabaster, 
when mended, should be heated ; heat the cement also on applying it. Join, 
bind together, and let it remain a week. It is a very strong cement 

^ 665. Iron-ware Cement; and To mend cracks in Stoves and Pipes, 

Stir into the white of eggs beaten to a froth, enough powdered ouick lime 
to make a consistent paste, and then stir in iron file dust to mi^e a thick 
paste. Fill the crack^ of iron-ware with this cement, and do not use it for 
some weeks. Mend cracks in stoves and pipes, by applying a paste of wood- 
ashes, salt, and water. 

666. - To renew Stale Bread and Cake, 
Fill a bread steamer about half full of water, and lay the old bread on it, 
and put it on the fire, where it will steam the bread thirty or forty minutes ; 
then wrap the bread in a towel, and let it remain till dry. Old dry bread may 
thus be made moist and good. As a substitute for a steamer, soak the bread 
in cold water till it has absorbed enough water to be moist throughout ; then 
put it in a bake-pan without any cover, ai^d make it very hot. If broken 
pieces of bread are put in the oven for several hours after baking, and rusked, 
they will keep good a long time. Heavy sour bread, in this way, may be 
made into tolerably good cakes and puddm^, if enough salaeratus be used to 
correct the acidity. Rich cake, that has wme or brandy, will keep good sev- 
eral months in cold weather, if kept cool and dry. When it is to be eaten, 
put it in a ci^e pan and set it in a bake pan that has half a pint of water in 
it ; put on the bake pan cover, and let the cake bake till heated very hot 
Let it get cold before cutting. 

667. To Pot Cheese, 
Cheese that has begun to mould, may be kept from becoming more so, if 
treated thus :^-cut off the mouldy part, then grate it, if the cheese be dry. If 
not, pound it fine in a mortar, crust and all. To each pound, when fine, put 
a spoonful of brandy, mix it well with the cheese, pfess it tight in a clean 
■tone pot, and lay a paper wet in brandy on the top. Cover the pot tight, 
and keep it in a cool ary place. Dry pieces of cheese may be potted in the 
same manner. Potted cheese is best a year old. It will keep several years 
without breeding insects. 

668. To preserve Cheese from Insects. - 
Cover the cheese, while whole, with a flour paste ; wrap a cloth round it, 
■nd cover that with paste ; keep the cheese in a cool dry place. Cheese 
with insects, if kept till cold weather, will be free of them. 

669. To freshen Salt Butter. 
If butter is too salt, allow to each pound of it a quart of new milk ; chum 
^ an hour, and then work it tike new butter; workmg in a little white sugar 
faaproves it It is said to ho as good as new butter. A bit of new salt buttet 
may be quite freshened, bv working it in cold water, and repeatedly changing 
the wator.

670. To Extract the BancidUy of Butter. 
Trnke a little for immediate use, aJlowiog two teaspoonfuls of salaeratos 
dissolved in a quart of boiling water for a pound of butter ; put in the butter, 
mix it well with the salsratus water, let it be till cold, then take it off care- 
fuuy, and work a teaspoonful of salt into it. Thus managed it does veiy well 
for cooking. ( 

671. To pot Butter for Winter. 
Into six pounds of new-made butter, work the mixture of a spoonful of 
powdered white sugar, one of salt, aind one of saltpetre. When you have 
finished putting down your butter, in a stone pot, cover it with fine salt, put 
in alternate layers of rait with the butter ; cover so -close as to exclude the 
air. Some prefer potting butter in brine : — make the brine of Uie saltness 
wished for tne butter, add half a spoonful of saltpetre to two gallons of brine, 
made by turning boiling water on the salt. Put it to^the butter when cold, 
and let it cover the butter. Another method — ^free the'butter entirely of the 
buttermilk ; work it up quickly with about half an ounce of salt to the pound ; 
let it lay one day or longer ; beat well together four ounces of salt, two of loaf 
sugar, and a quarter of an ounce of saltpetre, and work the mixture thoroughly 
into the butter, allowing half an ounce for every, pound. Pack it in iars or 
tubs, and place a layer of the mixture in folds of thin muslin, stitching it 
loosely and placing it neatly over the top. «> 

672. To preserve Cream for Steamboats or Sea Voyages 
Mix fresh rich cream with half its weight of loaf sugar ; cork it tight in 
bottles. When used, no sweetening need be added. 

673. To keep Eggs tUl Vtth of June, or for Christmas. 
Buy e^ for family use when cheapest ; put them into two gallons of 
water, mixed with half a pint of salt and half a pint of unslacked lime. Make 
the pickle with boiling water. Put it cold to the eggs. Let the eggs tte new 
laid, and perfect; c^uite covered with the lime water, and kept in a stone pot 
in a cool place. 1 hus pi-eserved, eggs will keep good six months. If occa- 
sionally turned over, the l)etter. 

674. To prepare Fat for Shortening, 
Except ham and mutton, all kinds of meat make good shortening. Scrape 
from the cold congealed drippings of roast meat, or the fat of boiled meat, ^e 
adhesive sediment; slice the fat,'adding any scraps of fat from broiled meat 
you may have; melt it slowly, and strain it. When congealed into a hard 
cake, scrape off the sediment if any adhere, melt it again, and when partly 
cool, add a teaspoonful of salt to a pound of shortening. Use the drera for 
soap-grease. Except in the hottest weather, shortening thus prepared is a 
good substitute for lard. The fat of cooked meats should not be kept more 
than three days in summer, and seven in winter, without being tried. Ham 
fat, if boiled in fresh water and clarified, does very well to fiy in. And mut- 
ton-fat, melted into a tallow cake, will please the tallow-chandler. 

675. Directions for Washing White Cotton Goods. 
Turn boiling water on table cloths, and all white clothes stained by coffee 
or fruit, before putting them in soap suds, and let them lay till the water is 
cold, then rubbing out the stains. The stains will be irremovably set, if put 
into soap suds. Table cloths will be less liable to stain if always rinsea in 
thin %tarch water, as that prevents the penetrating of stains. Put very diity 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 205 

white clothes in strong cool snds on the fire over night, and they will eastly 
clean. If they get to boiling, do not care. It will not hurt them if the sndiis 
be cool on putting them in — if hot then, if will set the dirt. The following 
saves labor : — Soak clothes in lukewarm soap suds, if very dirty, over nij^t; 
put a spoonful of salts of soda, and a pint of soil soap, to every three pails of 
water ; make it moderately warm ; put in the clothes without rubbing, and 
boil them an hour. 

676. To Wash Calicoes. 

Before putting the clothes in water, rub out the grease spots ; they cannot 
oe seen alter all is wet. Wash them in mildly warm soap suds, which will 
clean them as well as hot suds, with less injury to the colors. Use soft soap 
for yellow shades, but for no other ; and do not rinse in fair water. Rinse 
other colors in fair water, and dry them in the shade. If calicoes incline to 
fade, set the colors by washing them in lukewarm water, with beef's gall, 
allowing a teacup for every four or five gallons of water. No soap is required, 
unless the clothes are very dirty. Then wash them in tepid suds, after 
being rubbed out in beef's gall water. Rinse them in fair water. Beef's 
fgkW can be kept several months, by bottling it tight, and putting in a little 
salt. Wash black calicoes in water that potatoes have been boiled in. Such 
water may be saved through the whole week, or potatoes may be sliced and 
boiled, for the sake of the water. For mourning calico, the best way is to 
boil the clothes in strong hard soap suds about ten minutes, turning and 
pressmg them in the suds, and theit to rinse them in strong bluing water. — 
The following mode is said to set colors, ^ they will not fade by after wash- 
mg : — add three gills of salt to four quarts of boiling water ; put in the calicoes 
perfectly clean, and let them remain till the water is cold. A little alum m 
the rinsing water is good for green and yellow ; or a little vinegar for green, 
pink, and red. AH calicoes but black, look better for starching. They will 
not look clear. Potato water, boiled to a thick consistence, stiffens them 
without showing. 

677. To Wash Woolens. 

If you wish to thicken your flannels by shrinking them, wash them in soil 
soap suds, and rinse them in cold water. To prevent white flannels shrink- 
ing, wash them in hard soap suds, without rubbing any soap ' on them ; rub 
them out in another suds, wrin^ them out, put them in a clean tub, pour on 
boiling water to cover them, and let them remain till the water is cold. A 
little mdigo in the boiling water improves the looks of the flannels. Colored 
woolens that incline to fade, wash with beef's gall and warm water, before 
putting them in soap suds. Colored pantaloons look well washed with beef's 
gall and fair warm water, and pressed on the wrong side while damp. 

678. To remove Ink, Fruit Stains, and Iron Mould, 
Moisten the soiled part with cold water, then place it over the smoke of 
burning brimstone. Or wet the spots in milk, and cover them with salt, before 
washing the garments. Or dip ink stains in hot tallow. 

679. To remove Stains from Broadcloth. 
Take an ounce of fine ground pipe clay, mix it with twelve drsps of alco- 
hol, and twelve of the spirits of turpentine ; moisten a little of this mixture 
with alcohol, whenever you wish to remove any stains, and rub it on them. 
Let it remain till dry, then rub it off with a woolen cloth. 

680. To extract Paint from Cotton, Silk, and Woolen Goods. 
Saturate the soiled spot with spirits of turpentine, and let it remain soma

iMMin, then rab it between the hands. It will crumble away, without injozy 
to texture or color. 

681. To extract Black Stains from Scarlet Woolen Goods, 
Mix tartaric with water, to give it a pleasant acid, saturate the stains— (do 

not touch the unsoiled part)--rinse the stains in fair water immediately. 

Weak salwratus water will remote stains caused by acids. 

682. To extract Stains from Colored SUks and White Cotton 

Goods, 
Salts of ammonia, mixed with lime, will remove wine stains from silk; 
clear ammonia, alcohol, and spirits of turpentine, will all remove stains from 
colored silks. Durable or common ink spots may be removed, by saturating 
them with lemon juice, rubbing in salt, and then placing them where the sun 
will shine on them hot for some hours. Put on more lemon juice and salt, 
as fast as it dries. Nitric acid is a good substitute, when lemon acid cannot 
be had. Remove iron mould in the same way. Mildew and most other 
stains can be removed by rubbing on soft soap and salt, and placing the stain 
where the sun will shine on it, hot. Use the remedies in warm, clear wea- 
ther, when the sun is hot. Sulphuric acid, diluted with water, is effectual 
in removing fruit stains. Do not have it so strong as to eat holes ; rinse in 
Mderatus, men in fair water. Soak colored cotton ink stained goods in tepid 
sour milk. 

683. To extract Grease from Floors, Silks, Woolen Goods and 

Paper, 
Rub floor grease spots with stron^salseratus water mixed with sand. And 
on those of goods and paper, grate French chalk very thick ; f common chalk 
is not so gc^)— cover the chalk with sofY brown paper, ana place on it a 
moderately hot iron, not scorching hot, and let it remain till cool. If the 
grease is not entirely removed, repeat the application of the brown paper and 
a heated iron, until it is. 

684. To cleanse SUk Goods. 
Rub on silk cushions, or silk coverings to furniture, dry bran, with a woolen 
cloth, till clean. Remove grease spots and stains as by preceding receipts. 
Extract the siwts of silk garments before washin?. Use hard soap for all 
colors but yellow; for yellow, soft soap is best. Beat the soap in hot watci 
till perfectly dissolved, then add just enough cold water to make it tepid ; rub 
the silks in it till clean ; take them out without wringing, and rinse them in 
fair tepid water. Rinse them in another water — and for crimsons, bright 
yellows, and maroons, add enough sulphuric acid to the water to give it an 
acid taste. To restore the colors of the different shades of pink, pint a little 
vinegar or lemon juice in the second rinsing water. For scarlet, use a solu- 
tion of tin ; for purples, blues, and other shades, use salseratus ; and for olive- 
greens, dissolve verdipis in the rinsing water. Rinse fawn and browns in 
pure water ; dip the silks up and down in the rinsing water ; take tliem out 
without wringing, and dry them in the shade ; fold them while damp ; let 
them remain for the dampness to strike through all parts of them alike, and 
then put them in a mangier. If you have none, iron thcYn on the wrong side . 
with an iron only hot enough to smooth them. A little isinglass, or gum- 
arabic, dissolved in the rinsing water of gauze, shawls, and ribbons, is good 
to stiffen them. The water in which pared potatoes have been boiled, is an 
excellent thing to wash black silks in. It stiffens and makes them of a gloss^r 
biarik Beef's gal! and feoid water are nice for restoring rusty silks; and

•oap suds answers very well. The silks look better not to be rinsed in clear 
water, but thoy should be washed in two difFerent waters. 

685. To clean Silk and Woolen Shawls, 
Pare and grate mealy potatoes, and put to a pint of the pulp two quarts of 
loid water. On standing five hours, strain it through a sieve, rubbing M 
nuch of the potato through as possible^ Let the strained water stand to 
settle ; when perfectly clear, turn the water off carefully from the dregs ; 
spread a clean white cotton sheet on a clean table, lay on the shawl to be 
cleaned, and pin it tight. Dip a sponge that has never been used, in the 
potato water, and rub the shawl with it till clean ; rinse the shawl in clean 
water, with a teacup of salt to a pailful of water ; spread it on a clean level 
place, where it will dry very quick. If suspended to dry, the colors are apt 
to run and make the shawl streaked. Fold it up while damp, let it lay half 
an hour, and put it in a mangier ; or wrap it in a clean white cloth, and put 
it under a weight, and let it remain till dry. Grease spots, if any, should be 
extracted before washing the shawl. 

686. Carpets, 
Take up and shake carpets that are in constant use, three or four times a 
year. The dirt underneath wears them out very fast. Straw spread under 
neath prevents their wear. To prevent moths, take up your carpets once a 
year, if but little used. Sprinkle black pepper, or tobacco under your car- 
pets to protect them from moths. When freed of dust, remove the grease 
spots ; if soiled so as to need cleaning all over, spread them on a clean floor, 
and rub pared and grated raw potatoes on them with a new broom. Let 
them lay till perfectly dry, before walking on them. Some use beef's gall 
for cleaning carpets. Wash straw carpets in salt and water, and wipe them 
with a clean dry cloth. Some say, scour them with sand and water and a 
little hard soap. 

687. To renovate Rusty Italian Qrdpe, 
Dissolve in half a pint of skim milk and water an inch square of glue ; 
take it from the fire, rinse the crape in vinegar to clean it, then to stiffen it, 
put it iii the glue mixture, wring it, clap it dry, and smooth it with a hot iron, 
first laying a paper over it. Saturate rusty crape by dipping it in gin ; clan 
it dry, and smooth it with a moderately hot iron. Italian crape can be dyed 
so as !o look as nice as new. 

688. To clean Light Kid Gloves, 

Rub them smartly with India rubber, magnesia, or moist bread. If soiled 
beyond thus restoring, sew up the tops and rub them with a decoction of saf- 
fron and water, using a sponge. They will be yellow or brown, according 
to the strength of the decoction. 

Put on hid Gloves. Rub them with spirits of hartshorn ; or with flannel, 
dipped in milk, then rubbed on castile soap. 

689. To clean Mahogany and Marble, and to restore Mahogany 
Varnish. 
Use no soap on them ; wash them in fair water, and rub them till dry witn 
a clean soft cloth. A little sweet oil, rulibed on occasionally, gives them a 
poUsh. Rub furniture with a cloth dipped in oil; then, with a clean cloth, 
till dry and polished. Rubbing with sweet oil will restore the spots from 
which the varnish has been removed. White spots on varnished furniture 
may be removed, by rubbing them with a warm flannel dipped in spirits of 
turpentine. Remove ink spots by rubbing them with a woolen cloth, dipped 
in the oil of vitriol and water. Be carefu. to touch only the spots with the

Titriol. Rinse them with salaoratui water, and then with fair water It ic 
■aid, blotting paper will extract the ink, if rolled up, and rubbed hard on the 
spotii. Mahogany furniture may be beautifully polished thus : — rub it with 
cold drawn linaeed oil ; wipe off the oil, and polish by rubbing smartly with a 
clean dry cloth. And marble may be cleaned thus '.—pound, rerj fine, a 
little stone blue with four ounces of whiting ; mix them with an ounce of 
■oda dissolved in a little water, and four ounces of soft soap : boil all fifteen 
minutes over a slow fire, carefully stirring it. When quite hot, lay it'on the 
maible with a bnish, and let it remain half an hour ; wash it off with warm 
water, flannel, and a scrubbing brush, and wipe it dr|r. Some clean alabas- 
ter and all kinds of marble, by mixing pulverized pumice stone with rerjuice, 
letting it remain several hovs ; then dipping in a perfectly clean sponge, and 
rubbing the marble till clean. Rinse it off with fair water, and rub it dry 
with a clean linen cloth. ^ ,, 

690. To clean Knives and Forks. 
Use finelT powdered Bath brick to remove rust, and to polish steei uten 
ails. Rub knives on a board with a thick leather cover over it fastened down 
tight, applying a cork dipped in the powder, and moistened if they are spotted. 
Do not wet them, only wipe them with a dry cloth. Wipe the handles vrith 
a cloth rather damp, to make them smooth ; do not touch the blades, as it will 
tarnish them. It will yellow ivory handles to dip them in hot water. If 
yellow rub them with sand paper. If Bath brick does not remove rust from 
steel, rub the spots with aand paper or emery, or rub on sweet oil and let it 
remain a day, and then rub it off with quicklime. Clean thoroughly steel 
utensils that are not in constant use ; rub them over with sweet oil, and 
exclude the air by a wrapper of brown paper — ^wrapping each knife and fork 
separately. 

691. To polish Brass, Silver^ and Britannia Utensils. 
Dip a cloth moistened with spirits, (oil will do,) into pulverized rotten 
stone, and rub vour brasses ; and then polish them with dry rotten stone and 
a dry cloth. When brass utensils are not in use, thoroughly clean them with 
rotten stone and oil, wrap them up tight to exclude the air, and keep them in 
a dry place. Polish tUver with whiting or chalk pulverized. If spotted, rub 
the cluilk wet on thp silver, and let it remain till dry ; then rub it off and 
polish with a clean ary cloth. Hot ashes will remove spots which chalk will 
not. Rub Britanmoj if Sfiotted, with a flannel cloth dipped in sweet or lin- 
seed oil, and then wash it in soap suds and wipe dry. Polish by rubbing 
over, with a clean dry cloth, whiting, or chalk. 

692. Cautions relative to Brass, Copper, and Glazed Earthen. 
Utensils, 

Many lives have been lost in consequence of carelessness in the use of 
these utensils. Thoroughly cleanse with salt and hot vinegar, brass and 
copper, before cooking in them ; and never suffer any oily or acid substance, 
after cooked, to cool or remain in any of them. 

693. To clean Stoves and Stone Hearths. 
Put on varnished stoves several coats of varnish in the summer, to have it 
ret hard before used. Wash them in warm water without soap, and rub a 
little oil on them occasionally. It will make thrm lOok nice, and prevent 
the varnish wearing off. Black stoves that have never been varnished, with 
black lead and British lustre. It will not answer if they have been varnished. 
Mix them with cold water to a paste, rnb it on the stoves, and let the pasta 
remain till quite dry ; then rub the stoves with a dry, s \ff, flat brush, till

ckian and jjolished. To preserve the color of freestone hearths, wash tbem 
in water without any soap, rub on them while damp, pulverized freestone, 
let it remain till dry, and then rub it off. If stainea, rub them hard witti a 
piece of freestone. To have your hearths look dark, rub them with pure soft 
soap, or dilute it with water. Use redding for brick hearths, mixed with 
thin hot starch and milk. 

694. To remove Putty and Paint from Window Glass, 
Put salsratus into hot water till very strong ; saturate the putty or paint 
daub with it ; let it remain till nearly diy ; then rub it off haid with a woolen 
clolh. Whiting is good to remove it. Salajratus water is good to remove 
putty while green, on the glass. 

095. To extract Ink from Floors, 
Remove ink stains from floors, by scouring them with sand wet with water 
and the oil of vitriol, mixed. Then rinse them with strong salaeratus water. 

696. To temper Earthen-ware, 
Boil earthen-ware that is used for baking, (before using it, as it v«rill be less 
liable to crack,) covering it with cold water, and then heating it gradually. 
Let it remain in till the water has cooled. 

697. To temper New Ovens and Iron-ware, 
^ Before a new oven is baked in, keep up a fire in it half a day. Put up the 
lid as soon as the wood is removed. Do not use it for baking till it has oeen 
heated the second time. It will never retain its heat well, unless tern- 
pend in this way. Heat new flat-irons half a day also, before using them, 
to have them retain their heat well. New iron cooking utensils will be less 
liable to crack, if heated gradually five or six hours, and then cooled slowly 
before being used. Do not turn cold water into hot iron utensils, as it will 
crack them by cooling the surface too suddenly. 

698. To loosen tightly wedged Stopples of Decanters and Smelling 
Bottles, 
Rub a feather dipped in oil round the stopple, close to the mouth of the 
bottle ; place the mouth of the bottle towards the fire, about two feet from it. 
When warm, strike the bottle lightly on both sides, with any convenient 
wooden instrument, and take out the stopple. You may have to repeat the 
process. By perseverance, you will ultimately triumph, however closely 
wedged in. 

699. Ltp Salve. 

Dissolve a small lump of white sugar in a spoonful of rose-water^ (or com- 
mon water,) and simmer with it eight or ten mmutes, two spoonfuls of sweet 
oil, and a piece of spermaceti of the size of half a butternut, and turn all into 
a small box. 

700. Cold Cream. 

Put into a close vessol two ounces of the oil of almonds, half an ounce of 
spermaceti, and half an o\ince of white wax ; set the vessel in a skillet of 
boiling water, and when melted, beat the ingredients with rose-water till cold 
Keep It in a tight box, or wide-mouthed bottle. 

701. To prevent the formation of a Crust in Tea Kettles* 
Keip an oyster-shell in your tea kettle. By attracting the stony paitinlei

Tako woolen and for gannents not worn, late in the spring, and put tiieni 
in a chest with some camphor cum. Spermaceti is hett. Tobacco and cedai 
chips are a good preventire. When moths get into garments, hang them ia 
a closet, place a pan of coals in it, and make a strong smoke of tobacco. 

703. To cleanse Vials and Pie Plates, 
Cleanse bottles that have had medicine in them, by putting ashes in each 
immersing them in cold water and then heating the water gradually till it 
boils. Alter boiling an hour, let them remain in the water till it is cold. 
Wash them in soap suds, and rinse them till clear in fair water. Pie plates 
that have been long used for baking, are apt to impart an unpleasant taste 
on account of the rancidity of the butter and lard, imbibed. Put them in a 
brass kettle, with ashes and cold water, and boil them an hour. 

704. To make Sugar, or Honey Vinegar. 
Dissolve one part of susar with seven of water moderately warm ; put it 
m a cask ; stir in a pint of yeast to every eight gallons ; stop it close, and 
keep it in a warm place till sufficiently sour : or to one quart of clear hnney, 
add eight of warm water, mixing it well. After the acetous fermentatimi, a 
white vinegar will be formed, in many respects better than common vinegar. 

705. Lemon Pickle, 
Grate &e jellow rind from twenty-five fresh lemons ; qaaiter them, leav- 
ing them united at the blossom end ; sprinkle salt over th^m, and place them 
in the sun daily till diy ; then brush off the salt ; put them in a pot with 
pounded mace and nutmeg, an ounce of each, a handful of scraped dried 
oorse radish, twenty cloves of garlic, and a pint of mustard seed. Turn on a 
gallon of strong vinegar ; cover the pot close ; let it stand three months ; 
strain it ; and when clear, bottle it. 

706. Stocky Prepared for Soups or Gravies, 
Cat a knuckle of veal in slices, a pound of lean beef, and a pound of ]e«m 
ham. Put all in a pan, with three carrots, two onions, two turnips, two heads 
of celery, and two quarts of water. Let them stew till tender, without 
browning. Thus prepared, the stock may be used for soups, or for wliite or 
brown gravy ; if for brown, it must first be colored in the usual manner. 

707, Sandwiches, 
Cut, and spread neatly with butter, slices of biscuit, placing between every 
two pieces, a very thin slice of tongue. Lean ham, or the white meat Oa 
fowl may be substituted for the tongue. 

708. Rats, Cockroaches, Ants, Flies, MusquUoes, Worms. 

In Rat paths, spread chloride of lime or fine potash. Also rub it about 
their holes. For rats, too, and Cockroaches^ mix two parts fine Indian meal 
with three calcined plaster of Paris very fine. Pass thera, mixed, through a 
fine sieve. Place water near. Give too, wafers^ or black hellebore root 
with molasses. Red Ants can not crawl over a chalk mark. Give sulphur, 
green sage or mint, or a bowl with pint of tar and two quarts hot water 
Expatriate Mtuquitoes by a little spirits of lavender on a handkerchief or

Ly, and fill your bag again, and so on, till the whole has been pressed. Tarn 
^mb may be melted over again, if not freed of all its wax, and again put into

RECOMMENDATIONS. 



The Improvbd Housewife is just such a work as a good, intelligent 
American wife and mother, after thirty years* experience in the great and 
comprehensive art of housekeeoing and nursing, would give her daughters, 
as the concentrated and available experience of her life, in the duties upon 
which they are about to engage. It will be a pleasing and intelligent and 
profitable companion, and relieve the anxieties of husbands and wives. — 
jBmgor Whig 4* Ccurier, A very useful book. — Mom. News, St. Jofuu, N. B, 



The great fault with most cook-books is, that they contemplate too high 
Uvingf so that a frugal housewife cannot use them. This defect is obviated 
in the present werk. It is a guide to economy, as well as to comfort, show- 
ing how to provide excellent dishes from veiy plain materials ; and is not 
made up of extracts, but is the result of more tKan thirty-four years* expe- 
rience on the part of the author. — Boston Recorder. 



We have examined the work, and we consider it far superior to any yet 
published, besides being cheaper. Our New-England and Southern ex- 
changes all speak of it as being the best ever published. No housekeeper 
should be without it Sold by the asent only, now in the city. — Detroit Free 
Press. Should be made a text book for c very female seminary. — Brooklyn Ad 



It is the most thorough — ^the most clear book of its kind extant — Salem 
Advertiser and Argus. 



As a Book of Recipes^ we believe ** The Improved Housewife^* to be the 
best that caa be obtained. It contains also some esceUent hints. There is 
no reason and no excuse for not having our food properly prepared. There 
is no merit in caring nothing for what we eat. Our food should be prepared 
with reference to our health ; dnd this requires that our meats should be 
rightly cooked, and our bread rightly made. It is neither economical nor 
healthful to turn off a family with food which is left to cook itself. But 
there are a class of young housekeepers who seem to take some pride in 
their ignorance of this one great duty of a housekeeper. They are so trained 
by their mothers, and finally inflicted on some unfortunate man, whose only 
resource is to bear it the best way he can. To all such, we recommend 
this book as a partial relief. Others, who understand something about the du- 
ties of a housekeeper, will find it an important aid.— 3foM«r'« ittlw., N. York, 
Most valuable text book ; receipts the best ever presented.^iV. OrL Comrisr. 



Without being well cooked, the best victuals are supplied in vain. It is, 
therefore, essential that every mistress of a family should be qualified to 
direct her servants in this important particular. An excellent work— -con- 
tains ample instructions ; no housekeeper should be without it. — Baltimors 

Clipper.

RECOMMENDATIONS. 233 

The Improved Housewife contains a great variety of valuable receipts for 
cooking, and for general and domestic economy. We do not know of a 
work so well adapted to its objects, and so fit to be placed in the hands of a 
young housekeeper. It is also on a scale to suit those whose necessities 
demand plain-living and frugal housewifery. We can recommend it with 
great heartiness. — Riehmond Christian Advocate. 



It is a very valuable and useful book. — Richmond Republican, 



It professes to give what is much needed in the domestic circle, an 
economical plan of preparing food for the table. And, from a hasty glance at 
its pages, as well as from a number of judicious notices we have seen in 
reference to it, we have no doubt it will accomplish all its purposes. The 
volume also contains engravings for marketing and carving, two most indis- 
pensable accompaniments to goo<l cooking ; also a variety of new receipts 
on various other subjects. — Christian Repository, Philadelphia, 



Next to having any thing good to eat, the most important consideration is 
to have it well cooked and served up. In our mode of cooking we are 
lamentably at fault. This deficiency can well be supplied by the study of 
The Improved Housewife. It is a compend of all kinds of receipts, direc- 
tions for carving, extracting grease-spots, stains, &c. It contains a sum 
mary of all the duties of an accomplished housekeeper ; and, if practiced, 
it will make perfect. — Macon Messenger, Geo, 



The Improved Housewife presents a variety of useful novelties, rendering 
it superior, in several respects, to the ordinary cook-books. In those cases 
where it treats of the matters usually found in such works, it appears to be 
judicious and economicaly giving the actual results of the experience of the 
author. It has a series of drawings, showing how to purchase meats; a 
convenient table of weights reduced to their equivalent measures, obviating 
he necessity of scales ; drawings illustrative of carving ; directions for 
serving a dinner with propriety ; and, what is of great importance, jecipes 
in cookery for the sick. — Portland Advertiser. 



^This work should be found in every household. It is just such a one as 
the thrifty housewife would require. — Charleston Southern Patriot. 



Its pages possess a fund of information which cannot fail to be useful to 
those who study comfort and economy. — Democratic Union, Harrisburg. 



If this book had been studied when many of us went to school, our bread 
would have been better made. Hints how to procure the best pieces at 
market, and, after they are well cdbked, how to carve them, wilf be found 
useful. No family library should be without it. — The Georgian, Savannah. 



We cannot be far out of the way in saying, with every body who speaks 
of it, that " The Improved Housewife " is a capital book of its kind We

experience jf a lady, who is both theoretically and practically acquainted 
with the subject wliich she elucidates for the benefit of others. Ever)- pos-

to the comprehension of all persons. When generally known, this book 
will be prized as an indispensable manual to every housekeeper. — Repub 
Uccui Heraldj Providence. 



The Improved Housewife we believe to be the best work of the kind in 

Snut ; and one that should be in the hands of every family. We know 
[iss Leslie's to be an admirable work on housekeeping ; but w^e have 
always deemed her recipes to be too costly for general use. The work • 
before us has met that great fault ; and Mrs. W., after an experience of more 
thau thirty-four years as a practical housekeeper in married life^ has most 
judiciously adapted her work to an every day family use. Besides, ** The 
Improved Housewife" contains, in one convenient book, what Miss Leslie has 
spread over four books, and Makenzie over " five thousand receipts ;" and 
suificient under each respective head, in the one book, for the accomplished 
housekeeper. So far as merit is made the standard of comparison, it is the 
cheapest book of its kind. — Wilmington Chronicle. 



The Improved Housewife^ (published at Hartford, Conn., is well printed and 
neatl)' bound. And it contains an immense amount of useful in(ormation to 
housekeepers, in the way of directions for Marketing, recipe^ foi- cooking, 
for making preserves, pickles, pastry, dec, with a variety of miscellaneous 
information. The volume also contains a variety of plates, with directions 
for carving, choice of joints of meat, fish, &c. We have carefully lookea 
through Uj and we find that it has one great advantage over most worJcs of this 
description^ inasmuch as its recipes are not expensive^ but are calculated for 
»ne kitchens of families in moderate circumstances. This work is not in 
the hands of the booksellers, but is to be had of the agent only, who is now 
in Montreal. — Montreal Courier. 



Of " The Improved Housewife" we feel warranted in stating that it richly 
merits the rapid sale it has met with. And, no matter how many cook-books 
there may be in the house, this one book will more than, supply the place of 
all ; and without it you are " poor indeed." It is compiled by a married 
lady, mostly from the result of her own personal experience as a house- 
keeper for the last thirty-four years. No housekeeper ought to be without 
it. And many a young married man would find his purse heavier at the end 
of the year, would he but make his better half a present of this truly valua- 
ble work, and thus enable her to stop the leaks in the kitchen, that sieve to 
a uiaa's fortune. — Morning Telegraph, 



This book was written by one experienced in housewifery, has been 
practically tested, and the universal testimony is, that it is the best book of 
the kind. It contains full directions for every thing in the culinary line. Its 
superiority ccnsists in Us combining economy with good cooking. — Herald. 



It is of essential use to the information and economy of all classes. — Cres- 
eent Cityj N. Orleans. A most excellent work. — Picaywie. We add our con- 
currence to the variety and multiplicity of editorial notices of The Improved 
Housewife throughout the States, as the best work of its kind. — Qudiec Oaz. 



236 RECOMMENDATIONS. 

^ There in no branch of learning to which so strongly applies what CioeM 
says in praise of letters, as this of cookery. Evidently, therefore, it miul 
claim precedence over them aH : 

'Haec studia adolescentiam alant, senectutem oblectant; secnndas nt 
omant, adversis perfugium ac solatium praebent ; delectant domi, non im- 
l»ediunt foras : pemoctant nobiscum, pcrigrinantur, rusticantur.' " Nothing 
con be better: — National Intelligencer: 

We desired some practical housekeepers to examine this work and give 
IS their opinion of its merits. In their opinion it is decidedly the best work 
of the kind. The receipts are simple, yet rich; and when tried, will be 
found economical and excellent. 

We recommend it to all who wish to live well, in hesUh, peace and plenty. 

New Orleaau Presbyterian, 

A new edition of Mn. Webster's Improved Housewife. Its pages possess 
a fund of information which' cannot fail to be of great 8er>-ice to every mis- 
tress of a family. — Washington Union. 



The best work of its kind. It is preferred to Miss Leslie's for being less 
extravagant and l)etter adapted to an every-day use : — also, to Makenzie's five 
thousand "receipts; and it contains some hundred more receipts than the 
Carolina Housacife^ and a much greater variety of matter, with a comjAete set 
of engravings for marketing and carving. So far as real merit is the test 
of worth, it is the cheapest book of its kind. — American Beacon, 

We can utter no praise ^of this work which will not be a repetition cf 
ixxcmendation already expressed. — Danhfury Times. 

We have examined it. Think it the best compilation we have seen. 
Have no doubt its purchase would, in any family, effect a considerable sa 
Ting, besides adding to the comfort of a family. — Christian Visitor Si. John 
New Brunswick, 



It appears to be an exceedingly useful publication. — British North Ameru 
cm, HalifcuSf N, S, 



Besides its ^neral contents, we have abundance of Miscellaneous Re- 
ceipts for the sick and the healthy, and a Perpetual Calendar, veiy curious 
ana useful for reference. — Toronto Patriot, C, W, 



We have no hesitation in recommending it as the most comprehenslTe of 
the kind that we have seen.— JBrilcv A Colonist, HoK/ms, N, S, 



The receipts generally, are plain, and adapted to the means of persons 
of moderate circumstances, who would like to live well, but not extrava- 
gantly.— i2aii^<te Sun, Halifaee, N. S, 



There is hardly any thing pertaining to cookexy or other " household good,* 
for which instruction may not be found heie.— Christian Mirror, Portland 



By the by, next to having any thing to cook, and the knowing how to cook, 
is — a time to cook — and, a time to eat ; for the finding of which, and the onl^ 
time to get married, see Perpetual Calendar— and the Bridal Hour.
