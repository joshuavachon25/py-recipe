PEEFACE 



In offering this little book to the public, I am 
aware that there are many good cook books in the 
market al^ead3^ But I trust that this will supply 
a want which has always been felt by young house- 
keepers. The great trou^ic with all the cook books 
which I have known (and I am constantly hearing 
the same complaint) is, that they are too expen- 
sive, and that they use weight instead of measure, 
and also that they take for granted that the young 
housekeeper knows many things which she really 
does not. This want I have endeavored to supply 
in tliis little volume. Having had years of experi- 
ence as a cook in private families and hotels, I know 
the wants of the masses, and feel competent to sup- 
ply them. 

I have arranged this book in two parts — one for 
plain, and one for rich cooking. In the First Part 

8 



4 PREFACE. 

will be found minute directions for cooking every- 
thing that is within the reach of an ordinary family. 
In Part Second will be found directions for richer 
cooking. There is not one receipt in the book which 
has not been proved to be good. There are very 
few which I have not used myself, and of the value 
of those 1 am fully assured, having seen nearly all 
of them tried. The rules for jellies, charlotte russe, 
and creams will be found to be worth twice the 
price of the book. Many of the visitors to the 
Rockingham House, Portsmouth, N. H., Pavilion 
Hotel, Wolf borough, N. H., McMillan House, North 
Conway, N. H., and the Appledore House, Isle of 
Shoals, will find many dishes with which they ex- 
pressed themselves pleased while the writer was 
pastry cook at those houses. 



PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. 



Five years have passed since the first edition of 
The Appledore Cook Book was given to the pub- 
lic ; and, in that time, the author has been adding 
to her store of tried receipts, and now feels it a 
duty and a pleasure to give them to the public. 

The Appendix will be found to have been written 
oil the first plan of the book; that is, that there 
was to be nothing inserted which was not tried and 
practical.

THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

PART FIRST. 



FISH. 

Ohowder. 

Take either a cod or haddock ; skin it, loosen the skin 
about the head, and draw it down towards the tail, when 
it will peel off easily. Then run your knife down the 
back close to the bone, which you take out. Cut your 
fish in small pieces, and wash in cold water. Put the head 
on to boil in about two quarts of water, and boil twenly 
minutes. For a fish weighing six pounds, pare and slice 
thin five good sized potatoes, and one onion. Place a 
layer of potatoes and onion in the pot, then a layer of 
fish, dredge in a little salt, pepper, and flour. Keep put- 
ing in alternate layers of potatoes and fish until all is used. 
Use about one tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of 
pepper, one teacup of flour, in all. 

Have ready half a pound of salt pork fried brown. 
Pour this over the mixture ; add about two quarts of cold 
water, then strain on the water in which the head ha^

been boiled If this is not water enough to cover, add 
more cold. Cover tight, and boil gently thirty minutes. 
If not seasoned enough, add what you pleasL'. When it 
has boiled twenty minutes, put in six crackers which have 
been soaked three minutes in cold water. If you wish to 
add milk and butter, you can do so about five minutes be-- 
fore taking it up ; but for my taste, it is much nicer and 
more natural without either. 

Fish Chowder. ^j's. T. Leighton. 

Four pounds of fish, half cod and half haddock, if you 
can get the two kinds, two onions, six potatoes, eight 
white browns, one quarter of a pound of salt pork, salt, 
pepper. Prepare the chowder as directed in the preceding 
rule ; split tlic crackers and lay on the top, pour over the 
whole hot water enough to cover, and boil fifteen min- 
utes ; then wet two tablespoonfuls of flour with one-third 
of a cup of cream. Stir this into the boiling chowder, let 
it boil up once, and serve. When you cannot get the 
white browns, pilot bread will answer. When a very 
strong flavor of onion is desired, use four onions. 

Clam Chowder. 

When intending to have clams in any form, get them 
in the shell if possible, the day before. Place them in a 
tub, and cover with clean water, and throw into this 
about a quart of Indian meal. This fattens them. When 
ready to use the clams, wash them thoroughly, then cover 



FISH. 15 

them with boiling water, and let them stand ten minutes 
when they will open easily. Take them from the shell, 
cutoff the black heads, and put the bodies of the clams in 
a clean dish. Strain the water in which they were scalded 
into the kettle in which you intend to cook your chowder. 
To one peck of clams allow three quarts of water Let 
the water come to a boil, then thicken with half a cup of 
flour which has been mixed with cold water, season with 
pepper and salt. Add the clams and a tablespoouful of 
butter ; let it boil ten minutes. A few minutes before 
dishing, drop in three or four broken crackers. 

01am Chowder, No. 2. 

For one peck of clams take six good-sized potatoes, 
pared and sliced thin, half an onion cut into pieces an 
inch square. Fry quarter of a pound of pork to a nice 
brown ; place the pork and gravy, the potatoes and on- 
ions, in your kettle. Shake over the whole one table- 
spoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of pepper, and half a 
cup of flour. Strain over this four quarts of the water 
with which you scalded the clams. Place on the fire, and 
boil fifteen minutes, then add the clams and four split 
crackers ; boil ten minutes longer, and serve. 

Boiled Cod. 

Take the head and shoulders of a good-sized cod. 
Scrape and wash clean ; rab a handful of salt into it ; 
flour a cloth and pin the fish in it. Put it into boilipig 



20 THE APPIuEDORE COOK BOOK. 

water, and boil half an hour. Take the fish carefully from 
the cloth, and serve with egg sauce. Potato is the only 
vegetable that is nice with boiled cod. 



Pried Ood. 

Cut the fish into squares, wash and wipe dry. Take 
half a cup of flour, half a cup of sifted Indian meal, and 
a tablespoonful of salt. Mix all these thoroughly. Dip 
the fish into the mixture. Have ready a frying-pan with 
boiling fat, half lard and half pork fat ; drop in your fish. 
Fry a dark-brown on one side, then turn and fry the same 
on the other side, but be very careful not to let the fish or 
fat burn. Have your dish hot, and lay your fish on it. 
Garnish the sides with the fried pork. 



Broiled Ood, or Scrod. 

Split, wash, and wipe dry a small cod. Rub the grid- 
iron with a piece of fat pork, and lay the fish upon it, be- 
ing careful to have the inside downward. If the fish is 
very thick, cook thirty minutes ; but for an ordinary one, 
twenty minutes will be sufficient. Have the dish, in which 
you intend serving it, warm ; place it upon the fish, and 
turn the dish and gridiron over simultaneously. If the 
fish sticks to the gridiron, loosen it gently with a knife. 
Have some butter warm, but not melted, with which to 
season it. Shake on a little pepper and salt and send to 
Uie table. 



PISH. 21 



Baked Ood. 



Scrape and wash clean a cod weighing four or five 
pounds. Rub into it a heaping spoonful of salt. Make 
a dressing of three pounded crackers, a little chopped salt 
Dork, about one teaspoonful of parsley, a little salt and 
pepper, and two tablespoonfnis of cold water. Stuff the 
belly with this, and fasten together with a skewer. Lay 
thin slices of pork on the fish, which should be placed on 
a tin sheet that will fit loosely into the baking-pan ; dredge 
with flour. Pour into the pan about half a pint of cold 
water. Baste the fish often while cooking with the water 
which is in the pan. If the water cooks away, add more, 
but do not have too much to begin with, or the fish will 
be boiled instead of being baked. Bake one hour. When 
the fish is cooked, turn the gravy into a bowl, then lift 
out the fish upon the tin sheet (from which you can easily 
elide it into the dish upon which you serve it) ; now turn 
your gravy into your baking-pan again, and place it on 
the fire ; when it comes to a boil, thicken with a table- 
spoonful of flour, season with pepper and salt. 

N. B. Always use a tin sheet in the baking-p?in when 
cooking fish, as you then can preserve the shape. 



Tongues and Sounds. 

Soak the tongues and sounds in cold water over night. 
Put them in cold water and place on the fire. Let them 
boil thirty minutes, and serve with drawn butter. 



il THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Salt Cod Pish. 

Soak a whole fish in cold water over night ; in the 
morning wash clean, and cut off the tail and fins. If you 
have not a fish kettle, place it in a large milk pan, which 
nearly fill with water, cover, and set over a kettle of warm 
water. Let it cook in this way five or six hours. Serve 
with egg sauce and pork scraps. Potatoes, beets, and 
carrots are the vegetables to be served with salt fish. 
There are but few cooks who know how, or, if they do 
know, who take the pains, to get up a nice ealt fish din- 
ner ; but those families who are so fortunate as to have 
this dish well served consider it equal to a turkey dinner ; 
therefore I shall give minute directions for the prepara- 
tion of it. One of the most essential things is to have 
everything hot. Have all your dishes warm, and dish 
quickly, that all may go to the table at once. Serve the 
fish whole ; garnish the dish with a few pieces of beet 
and carrot. Cut your pork, and fry a nice brown. Boil 
an egg ten minutes, dip it into cold water, and peel of the 
shell. Cut it up with a silver spoon, as a knife blackens 
it, and put into the dish in which you intend serving the 
sauce. To a piece of butter the size of an egg, add a 
tablespoonful of flour. Blend these together well, and 
when the dinner is ready to serve, pour on a little less 
than half a pint of boiling water. Let this come to a boil, 
and pour it upon the egg. Never let drawn butter boil, as 
it becomes oily and unpalatable. The fish which is left 
from the dinner will be very nice for hash and fish balls. 



Fistt. 23 

Broiled Salt Pish. 

Cut a square the size you desire, from the thickest part 
of the fish. Take oiBf the skin, and wash clean ; broil 
over clear coals ten minutes, then dip in boiling water, 
butter, and serve. This is a nice relish for breakfast or 
tea, and with boiled potatoes makes an excellent dinner. 

Salt Pish in Cream. 

Tear a piece of fish into small strips, wash clean, and 
place it in a basin with about a quart of water ; let it 
simmer half an hour. Then pour off the water, and add 
one pint of new milk. When this comes to a boil, thicken 
with one spoonful of flour ; let it boil five minutes, then 
add butter the size of a walnut, and a little pepper, and 
serve. 

Fish Balls. 

Take the fish left from the dinner, put it in your chop- 
ping tray, being careful that there are no bones in it; 
chop fine. Pare and boil potatoes enough to have twice 
the quantity of potatoes that you have of fish When 
cooked, turn them into the tray with the fish ; mash fine, 
and make into balls about the size of an egg. Flour the 
outside lightly ; have the fat boiling hot, and fry a light 
brown. The fat should be half lard and half salt pork. 
Have the slices of pork a nice brown, and serve with the 
fish balls. 



24 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Another Mode. 

Prepare as above ; and to a quantity that will noako a 
dozen balls add an egg, butter half the size of an egg, 
Bait and pepper. Shape and fry as before directed. 

Another Mode. 

Chop fine one good-sized beet, and mix well with one 
pint bowllul of fish and two of potato. Add to tliis the 
pork scraps left from dinner, or, if none have been left, 
fry a few slices of salt pork, and mix the fat with the fish 
and potato. Shape and fry as directed above. 

Fish Hash. 

Prepare the fish as for fish balls ; chop fine cold pota- 
toes, and mix with the fish. Fry brown six good slices 
of salt pork ; take out the pork and turn the hash into the 
frying-pan ; add half a cup of boiling water ; let this heat 
slowly, stirring often ; then spread smoothly, and brown, 
being careful not to let it burn. VV^hen brown, fold it as 
you would an omelet, dish, and garnish the dish with the 
slices of pork. Where pork is objected to, butter can be 
used instead. 

Salt fish, when cooked and chopped, will keep for a 
week, if nothing else is mixed with it. When intending 
to have hash or fish balls for breakfast, the fish should bo 
chopped the night before, and the potatoes should be 
pared and put in cold water. Put the potatoes on the 



FISH. 25 

fire as bood as it begins to bum ; they will then be ready 
for use when joa are ready for them. 

Boiled Halibut 

Poor into a pan about half an inch deep of boiling 
water ; into this lay the side of the halibut on which is 
the black skin ; let this stand a few minutes ; then scrape 
with a knife, when the black will be found to peel off 
readily. Wash clean in cold water, then pin it in your 
fish-cloth, and drop it into boiling water. For a piece 
weighing fonr pounds allow twenty-five minutes to boil. 
Serve with irawn butter. 

Pried Halibut. 

Take a slice of halibut, sprinkle with -salt, and dredge 
with flour. Fry four slices of salt pork, add to the pork 
fat one spoonful of lard. When boiling hot put in the 
halibut. Fry a light brown on one side, then turn and fry 
the same on the other. Serve the pork with it. 

Broiled Halibut. 

Grease the gridiron with a little butter, place the hali- 
but upon it, sprinkle a little salt over it, and place over 
clear coals. Cook one side ten minutes, then turn and 
cook upon the other side ten more. Have the dish warm ; 
put the fi»h upon it, season with pepper and butter, and 
send to the table. 



26 THU APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Smoked Halibut. 

Broiled the same as the fresh, omitting the peppei and 
salt. Smoked salmon cooked in the same way. 

Boiled Salmon. 

Salmon is boiled the same as halibut ; served with egg 
sauce. 

Fried Salmon. 
The same as halibut. 

Broiled Salmon. 
The same as halibut. 

^ Salmon Trout. 

When large enough, split down the b'ack, clean and 
broil. Season with butter and salt. When small, open 
far enough to take out the insides ; wash clean, and wipo 
dry. Fry the same as cod fish. 

Shad and Haddock. 
Shad and haddock can be cooked the same as cod. 

Fresh Mackerel Boiled. 

If not cleaned, open them at the gills, take out the iiv 
sides, wash clean, and pin in a fish-cloth. (Do not use 
the cloth that you use to boil mackerel in for any other 
fish.) Drop into boiling water, and boil fifteen minutea. 
Serve with drawn butter. 



FISH. 27 

Broiled Mackerel. 

Split down the back and clean. Be careful to scrape 
all the thin black skin from the inside. Wipe dry and lay 
on the gridiron ; broil on one side a nice brown, then turn 
and brown the other side ; it will not take so long to 
brown the side on which the skin is. (All fish should 
have the side on which the skin is, turned to the fire last, 
as the skin burns easily, and coals are not so hot after you 
have used them ten minutes.) Season with butter, pep 
per, and salt. 

Fried Mackerel. 

Fry brown six good-sized slices of pork. Prepare your 
mackerel as for broiling. Take out your pork, sprinkle a 
little salt over the mackerel, then fry a nice brown. Serve 
the fried pork with it. 

Baked Mackerel. 

Prepare as for boiling. Make a dressing as for baked 
cod. Stuff with this, dredge with salt and flour. Bake 
thirty minutes, basting often with water, butter, and flour. 
Make a gravy with the water in the pan in which the fish 
is baked. Always make the gravy quite salt. The best 
way to cook mackerel is to broil it. 

. To Broil and Fry Salt Mackerel. 
Soak over night, and cook the same as fresh. 



28 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Salt Mackerel in Cream. 

Freshen aa for broiled mackerel, then lay into a baking 
pan, and to one mackerel add half a pint of new milk, 
put into the oven, and bake twenty-five minutes. About 
five minutes before it is dished add a small piece of but- 
ter. This is a nice dish for breakfast and dinner. 

To Boil Salt Mackerel. 

Wash the mackerel, and soak over night in clear cold 
water. Put them on to boil in coZcZ water, and boil gently 
thirty minutes. Serve with drawn butter. 

Smelts. 

The only true way to cook smelts is to fry them, al- 
though they are sometimes baked. Open them at the 
gills. Draw each smelt separately between your finger 
and thumb, beginning at the tail ; this will press the in- 
sidcs out. (Some persons never take out the insides, but 
it should be done as much as in any other fish.) Wash 
thorn clean, and let them drain in a cullender; then salt 
and roll in a mixture half flour and half Indian meal, 
[lave about two inches deep of boiling fat in the frying- 
pan (drippings if you have them ; if not, lard) ; into this 
drop the smelts, and fry brown. Do not put so many in 
that they will be crowded ; if you do, they will not be 
jrisp and brown. 

Brook Trout. 
Brook trout are cooked the same aa smelts : or you c^n 



FISH. 29 

cook them as the angler does. They must be split nearly 
to the tail to clean. Wash and drain For a dozen good- 
sized trout, fry six slices, of salt pork ; when brown, take 
out the pork, and put in the trout. Fry a nice brown on 
all sides. Serve the pork with them. 

To Boil Lobster. 

There are comparatively few who ever haveanythingto 
do with a lobster until after it has been boiled ; but for the 
benefit of the few I insert this. Be sure that the lobster 
is living; if not, it is not fit for use. Ilavo a kettle of 
boiling water ; into this drop the lobster, and boil until 
the shell turns red. This takes about an hour. Take up, 
and when cold it is fit to eat. 

Stewed Lobster. 

Take out all the meat from the shell. Chop it, but not fine. 
Put into a basin with a little salt, pepper, butter, and half a 
cup of water to a small lobster. Stew about ten minutes. 

OuTried Lobster. 

Prepare the lobster as for stew ; when it comes to a 
boil, add a mixture of a heaping teaspoonful of flour, and 
half a teaspoonful of Indian curry mixed with cold water. 
Let this boil eight minutes, then serve. 

Eels Pried. 
Skin them ; then turn on boiling water, and let them 



30 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

stand in it a few moments ; then cut them into pieces 
about three inches long. Fry a nice brown, and serve. 

Baked Eels, 

Prepare as for frying ; then put into a baking-pan, with 
a little water, flour, pepper, and salt. Bake twenty min- 
utes. Make a gravy of the liquor in which they were 
baked, adding a little butter. 

Eemarks in regard to Fish. 

Pish should never stand in water, as it spoils the flavor. 
Fish should never be fried in butter. It should always be 
used while fresh. Plain boiled or mashed potatoes should 
always be served with it Squash and green peas go very 
well with fish also. Always save all that remains after a 
meal, and warm up, to help out another dish. The re- 
mains of boiled fresh fish can be warmed up in a little but- 
ter, pepper, salt, and water, as you would stew lobster. 
Cold filed and broiled fish can be placed in a tin pan, and 
set into the oven ten minutes, when it will be found to be 
hot enough. Fish balls can be steamed for ten or fifteen 
minutes, and then set into the oven to get crisp. If you 
have a large piece of boiled fish, which you wish to servo 
whole, place it on a plate, and set into the steamer, and 
steam twenty minutes. If you have drawn butter to warm 
up, do not set it on the fire, but put it into a bowl, and set 
the bowl into hot water. Cook butter as little as possible, 
as by cooking it becomes oily. When you do use it, al- 
ways add it three or five minutes before taking the dish 
from the fire. 



^ SOUPS. 

Beef Soup. 

Every family Bhould have a soup once a week at least. 
Always save the bones of roast meats for a soup. Take 
the bones of a roast of beef, break them up so that they 
will go into a soup-pot. Lay them in the pot, dredge with 
salt, pepper, and flour. Cut into this one smaW onion ; 
add three quarts of cold water. Set on the fire, and when 
it comes to a boil, skim it. Let it boil gently three hours, 
then add eight sliced potatoes, and boil twenty minutes. 
Have ready dumplings ; put them in and cover tight, and 
boil ten minutes longer, then dish. First take out the 
dumplings and place in a small platter, then turn the soup 
into a tureen, being careful to take out the bones, and serve. 

Mutton Broth. 

Take a shoulder or neck of mutton, cut into small 
pieces, wash and put into the soup-pot. When it comes 
to a boil, skim it carefully ; then boil gently two hours. 
To four pounds of meat add four quarts of water, and 
half a cup of rice. Do not put in the rice until the meat 
has boiled two hours, then add rice, and season with pep* 

31 



32 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

per, salt, and half an onion ; boil two hours longer, and 
serve. I will give another method, which is better if the 
soup is the only dish for dinner. 

Mutton Broth. No 2. 

Prepare the meat as for No. 1, and to the same quantity 
of meat and water add half an onion, one small white tur- 
nip ; boil two hours, then add one third of a cup of rice ; 
boil one hour and a half longer, then add six sliced pota- 
toes. Season to taste with pepper and salt Boil twenty 
minutes, then add the dumplings ; cover tight and boil ten 
minutes, then dish and serve as you would beef soup. 
When preparing the meat for all these kinds of soups, cut 
off all the fat, and fry out for dripping ; thus your soup 
will not be greasy, and you will have the fat free from the 
taste of vegetables. 

Dumplings for Soup. 

Take one pint of flour (measured before it is sifted), 
turn into a seive, and measure into it one teaspoonful of 
cream of tartar, one half of saleratus, one half of salt, and 
one of sugar. Run this through the sieve, and wet with 
milk ; have the dough stiff enough to roll. Cut into very 
small cakes, and cook ten minutes. Be sure that your 
soup boils ^dst enough to get up a good steam, and keep 
boiling while the dumplings are in the pot ; if you do not, 
they will be heavy. Some persons like them for a des- 
sert. When used for that purpose, they should be eaten 
^ith sirup. 



SOUPS. 33 

"Veal Soup. 

Take four pounds of the neck of veal, cut up small and 
wash clean ; put into the soup-pot and cover with six 
quarts of water ; let this come to a boil, then skim off all 
the scum ; boil two hours, add half a cup of rice, and boil 
one hour longer ; then add one third of a cup of flour 
mixed with water, salt, and pepper. Boil gently one and 
a half hours, stirring often to prevent burning ; then add 
a tablespoonful of butter, and dumplings made as directed 
for beef and mutton soup. Potatoes and onions can be 
used as for mutton broth No. 2, and some use a little pork 
to flavor it. 

Pea Soup. 

Pick the peas over, that there may be no blemished ones 
among them. Wash and soak over night. In the morn- 
ing turn ofi" the water and put them in the soup-pot. For 
one quart of peas allow eight quarts of cold water and one 
pound of lean salt pork, a small piece of celery, a little 
pepper, and half an onion ; boil gently eight hours, being 
very careful that it does not burn. Have a large wooden 
spoon to stir it with. When done, it should be thin 
enough to pour. In boiling, it may become too thick ; if 
so, add boiling water. When cooked, it is smooth and 
rather mealy. If not cooked enough, after standing a few 
minutes the thick part will settle, and the top look wat*'ry. 
Have ready six slices of bread toasted brown, and cut into 
pieces an inch square ; throw about a dozen of thesf 



34 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

piecee into a tureen, and the remainder send to the table 
dry. Strain the soup through a sieve, and serve. If the 
pork does not salt it enough, use salt. This soup is even 
better warmed over than at first. Some persons use soup 
stock and butter, but it seems to me that it is rich enough 
made in this way, and much healthier. 

The bones left from roast lamb, mutton, and veal can all 
be used to make soups the same as those of roast beef. 



MEATS. 

Boiled Corned Beef. 

Wash a piece of beef weighing ten pounds ; put it into 
two gallons of cold water ; when it comes to a boil, skim 
carefully and boil very slowly six hours. Some boil all 
kinds of vegetables in the same pot ; but there is this ob- 
jection to this method ; you lose the distinctive flavor of 
each vegetable, and the beef is flavored with the vege- 
tables, which is very unpleasant when it is cold. The 
vegetables to serve with corned beef are potatoes, cab- 
bage, beets, turnips, parsnips, carrots. When the beef is 
simply for one hot dinner, the part of the beef is not of 
so much consequence ; but when it is to be pressed, there 
should be care taken in the selection of the piece to boil. 
The brisket, the flank, and the thin part of the ribs are 
the best parts to press. Boil as before directed, and take 
out the bones, lay the meat on a large platter, and place 
a tin sheet upon it ; on the sheet place a weight, and set 
in a cool place. When ready to use it, trim the edges, 
and use the trimmings for meat hash. This makes a nice 
dinner with baked potatoes, squash, turnip, and macaroni. 



85 



36 THE APPJLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Boiled Salt Tongue. 

Soak the tongue over niglit ; in the morning put on to 
boil in six quarts of cold water, and boil slowly six hours 
if the tongue is large ; if not, five will answer. Take it 
from the boiling water and throw it into cold water, and 
peel the skin off. Set away to cool. For dinner, use the 
same vegetables as for cold corned beef. The roots will 
make a nice hash. 

Boiled Fresh Tongue. 

Wash and put into four quarts of boiling water, with a 
large handful of salt. Boil slowly six hours, if large. 
When done, throw into cold water, and skin the same as 
the salt tongue. The water in which all meats are boiled 
should be saved until cold, and the fat should be taken off 
and clarified. The liquor should never stand in iron ket- 
tles, as it rusts them. 

Boiled Plank of Beef. 

This is a part of the beef that many persons think al- 
most useless ; but by being properly prepared it makes an 
elegant dish. Wash the flank, and make a dressing as 
for turkey, and spread over it, first having salted and pep- 
pered it well, then roll up and tie. Wind the twine round 
jt several times, to keop it in place ; then sew in a cloth 
kept for that purpose Put a small plate in the pot, and 
put in the meat ; then pour on about six quarts of boiling 



MEATS. 37 

water, and boil gently six hours. When done, remove the 
cloth, but not the twine until stone cold ; then cut into 
thin slices, and you will have alternate layers of meat and 
dressing. This is a very nice dish foi breakfast or tea. 

Boiled Ham. 

Have a coarse hair brush for cleaning hams, as it is 
impossible to get them clean by simply washing them. 
If the ham will not fit in the pot, cut off the knuckles, 
which will cook in two hours. Cover with cold water, 
and boil. A ham weighing twelve pounds will require 
five hours. When cooked, take up and put into a bak- 
ing pan, to skin. Have a basin of cold water, into 
which dip the hands ; then take the skin between the 
fingers, and peel as you would an orange. Roll a 
cracker and sift it over the ham, then set in the oven 
thirty minutes. Save the liquor in which it has been 
boiled, and skim the fat for soap grease. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. 

Take a leg weighing eight pounds, and put into six 
quarts of boiling water ; throw into this half a cup of 
rice In a few minutes a scum will rise, which must 
be skimmed off carefully. Boil one hour and a quar- 
ter ; allow five minutes more for every pound over 
eight. This time wiU allow the blood to run, which 
should always be the case with mutton. Servo with 
caper sauce. The rice gives it a white lock. Serve 
with this plain boiled potatoes, turnips, and onions. 
Save the liquor in which the meat was boiled, for soup. 



S8 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Boiled Shonlder of Mutton. 
Cooked and served the same as the leg. 

Boiled Leg or Shonlder of Lamb. 

For a leg or shoulder weighing six pounds, allow an 
hour and twenty minutes, and for every pound over 
that allow ten minutes. Serve with drawn butter or 
mint sauce. Serve with it green peas, potatoes, white 
turnips. If asparagus or spinagc is in season, substi- 
tute for turnips Save the liquor for soup. Lamb, how- 
ever, is always nicer roasted. 

Boiled Fowl and Pork. 

Singe, draw out the inwards, being careful to take 
out the lights and crop. Cut open the gizzard and clean. 
Wash the fowls and put them, with Iho hearts, livers, 
and gizzards, into boiling water, in which about one 
pound of pork has been boiling three hours. If they 
are young and tender, one hour and a quarter will cook 
one weighing three pounds. If old and tough, they 
sometimes take three hours. Truss the same as turkey. 
Serve with drawn butter. Dish the pork with the fowls. 
A little rice boiled in the water give them a white ap- 
pearance. Serve with them mashed turnip, mashed po- 
tatoes, boiled parsnips or green peas, corn or spinage 
when in season. Save the liquor for soup. 



MEATS. 39 

Boiled Veal. 

Take out the bone from a shoulder of veal, and fill 
the cavity with a dressing made as for poultry; then 
fasten together with a skewer ; wind twine around it, and 
tie tight. Put this into a kettle with about a pound 
of lean salt pork, and cover with boiling water. Boil 
slowly four hours, if it weighs ten pounds. Serve with 
celery sauce, or with a gravy made with one pint of 
the liquor in which it has been boiled, thickening with 
one heaping spoonful of flour, salt, pepper, and a little 
butter. Serve with boiled potatoes, macaroni and cheese, 
and horseradish. Save the liquor in which it has been 
boiled, to use next day in making a pie with what re- 
mains from the dinner. 

Boiled Turkey. 

Singe and wash the turkey, then rub into it a hand 
fill of salt ; stuff it with a dressing made by directions 
given under " Dressing for Poultry." Sew up and put 
into boiling water, enough to cover it. For one weigh- 
ing ten pounds allow two hours boiling, and fifteen 
minutes for every added pound. Serve with oyster or 
celery sauce, mashed potatoes, mashed turnips, boiled 
parsnips, plain boiled macaroni. Save the liquor for a 
soup. Sometimes a turkey will be very old and tough, 
in which case it will require a longer time to boil ; but 
a little practice and observation will help every house- 
keeper to understand when to allow more or less tim« 
for boiling. Truss the same c« for "toasting. 



40 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Boast Beef. 

Meats roasted in a tin kitchen require a longer time 
to cook than in an oven, but they arc very much nicer 
cooked in the former. Wring a clean towel out of cold 
water, and wipe the meat with it (if possible, never 
wash beef; as by this means a great deal of juice is 
lost) ; then rub into it a handful of salt, and dredge 
with flour. ]f cooked in a tin oven, run the spit through 
it. See that the spit is as near through the middle as 
possible ; if not, it will be difficult to turn it. Dredge 
flour into the kitchen, and when brown put in a pint 
of hot water. Cook a piece of beef weighing eight 
pounds an hour and twenty minutes if you wish it rare ; 
if not, cook twenty minutes longer. Baste often with 
pepper, salt, flour, and the water in the bottom of the 
kitchen, and turn often. Ten minutes before dishing 
the dinner, turn the gravy into a basin, and skim of 
all the fat ; let it c5me to a boil, and thicken with one 
large table-spoonful of flour mixed with cold water ; 
season with salt and pepper. Serve with mashed po- 
tatoes, squash, boiled rice, and pickled beets. When 
baked in the oven, one hour will be sufficient for a 
piece weighing eight pounds Place a grate in the 
baking-pan, and upon the grate lay the meat. Into the 
par pour a pint of warm water ; watch carefully that 
the water does not boil away and the gravy become 
buiued. Add but little water at a time, for if there is 
too much the meat will be steamed instead of roasted. 



MEATS. 41 

and also the gravy will not become brown. Baste as 
when roasted in a tin oven. Make the gravy as before 
directed. 

Eoast Mutton. 

Take out the first joint from a leg of mutton ; afeK 
the butcher to do it when you order it. Wash, and 
rub into it a handful of salt. Cut in around the bone, 
so as to make the cavities as large as possible, and fill 
with a dressing made in the following manner : Soak in 
cold water about two quarts of pieces of stale bread. 
When soft, drain in a cullender ; then mix with this 
half an onion, which has been chopped very fine, one 
teaspoonful of pepper, one tablespoonful of salt, one ogg, 
butter the size of an egg, and one tablespoonful of 
summer savory. Fasten together with a skewer, then 
dredge with salt and flour, and roast the same as beef 
For a piece weighing ten pounds allow one hour and a 
half, and ton minutes for every pound over or under 
that. Skim all the fat from the gravy; for half a pint allow 
one tablespoonful of flour to thicken with ; season with 
pepper and salt. Put one tablespoonful of currant jelly 
into the gravy tureen, and strain the gravy upon it. 
Serve with mashed potatoes, boiled onions, boiled rice 
or macaroni, mashed turnip, currant jelly. 

When the tin kitchen is used it will require half an 
lour longer to roast The shoulder and saddle are 
cooked in the same way. Always make a dressing for 
mutton; it spends much better, and the trouble is not 
much. Omit the egg if you please. When you do 
not stnflf it, cook it in twenty minutes less time. 



42 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Boast Lamb. 

Take a leg of lamb weighing six pounds, wash and 
dredge with salt and flour. Cook one hour if in an 
oven, one and a quarter if in a tin kitchen. Baste 
often. Make the gravy the same as for mutton, omit- 
ting the jelly. Serve with mashed potatoes, green 
peas, fried parsnips, or green corn, string beans, sum- 
mer squash, mint sauce. Never omit the gravy because 
you have mint sauce. All other parts of the lamb can 
be roasted in the same way. 

Eoast Veal. 

The loin, breast, and fillet are the best parts for 
roasting; the neck also is good to roast. Wash the 
veal, and rub into it a good handful of salt. Make a 
dressing in the following manner, and stuff it : Soak 
about two quarts of stale bread in cold water, chop 
fine half a pound of clear fat pork. Mix this with the 
bread and one tcaspoonful of pepper, one of salt, one 
tablespoonful of sweet marjorum, one of sage, one egg 
or two rolled crackers. Take out all the bones possible, 
and cut slits to make cavities for the dressing ; then stuff 
and skewer securely ; dredge with salt, pepper and flour. 
Have thin slices of salt pork, which lay on the top of the 
veal. Cook a piece weighing twelve pounds five hours, 
and baste very often. I should always roast veal in the 
oven. Make the gravy as for roast beef, but do not 
strain. If possible, always cook a large piece of veal, 



MEATS. 43 

because bo many nice dishes can be made from cold 
roast veal. Serve mashed potatoes, spinage, asparagus, 
fried parsnips, horseradish. 

Eoast Pork. 
Wash and dredge a sparerib with salt, pepper, sage, 
and flour ; and roast the same as beef. Cook a spare- 
rib weighing ten pounds three hours, if cooked in a tin 
kitchen ; if in the oven two hours and a half. Have 
the oven moderately hot. The chine to be cooked in 
the same way, allowing one hour longer for a piece 
weighing the same as a sparerib. Make the gravy as 
directed for roast beef. Serve potatoes, squash, fried 
or boiled onions, boiled rice, mashed turnips, apple- 
sauce. 

Broiled Beefsteak. 

Cut the steak about three quarters of an inch thick. 
Have a clear fire and lay the steak on the gridiron, 
and dredge lightly with flour. If you desire the steak 
rare, cook ten minutes ; if well done, fifteen. Dish 
and season with butter, pepper and salt. Serve imme- 
diately. Never set steak into the oven to keep warm 
or to melt the butter. The dish must be hot, the but- 
ter stand in a warm room long enough to soften but 
do not melt. If for dinner, servo potatoes, either 
baked or boiled and any other vegetables which you 
choose. Many persons pound tough steak before cook- 
ing, but I would not recommend it, as by this mean^ 
it looses much of its juiciness. 



44 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

There are some families in the country who have no 
means of broiling. The next best thing such persons 
can do is to heat the frying-pan very hot, and grease 
with just enough butter to prevent the steak from 
sticking ; then lay the steak in, and cook, and serve 
as before directed. 

Pried Beefsteak. 
For two pounds of steak fry brown four slices of 
salt pork, then take up the pork and fry the steak in 
the fat; salt and pepper it. When you dish add a 
little butter. To the fat remaining in the frying-pan, 
after the steak has been cooked, add one tablespoonful 
of dry Qour (be sure to have the fat boiling), and stir 
until it is brown and there are no lumps, then pour in 
about half a cup of boiling water. Season well with 
pepper and salt. Serve in a gravy tureen. This is a 
more economical, but not so healthy a method as 
broiling. 

Beefsteak Smothered in Onions. 
Fry brown four slices of salt pork ; when brown 
take out the pork, and put in six onions sliced thin. 
Fry about ten minutes, stirring all the while ; then 
take out all except a thin layer, and upon this lay a 
slice ol steak, then a layer of onions, then steak, and 
cover thick with onions. Dredge each layer with pepper, 
salt and flour. Pour over this one cupful of boiling 
water, and cover tight. Simmer half an hour. When 
you dish, place the steak in the centre of the dish, 



MEATS. 45 

aad heap the onions around it. Serve the same veget- 
ables as for broiled steak. 

Italianed Beef. 
Broil the steak as before directed ; place in the dish 
and cover with onions prepared in the following man- 
ner : Slice very thin four good-sized onions, and fry 
in pork fat thirty minutes, then add half a cup of 
boiling water, cover tight, and simmer thirty minutes 
longer. Whil^ frying, season with pepper, salt and a 
little butter. Vegetables the same as for broiled steak. 

Stewed Beef. 
Take a piece of beef that is rather tough, or pieces 
of tough beefsteak; rub into it a handful of salt, some 
pepper and flour ; lay in a kettle that you can cover 
tight, and that has a flat bottom. Cut up an onion, 
a potato, a small turnip, a carrot and a parsnip ; lay 
these on the top of the rai^at and then sprinkle in 
half a teaspoonful of cinnamon, half of mace, one fourth 
of clove, and add cold water enough to cover it. Let 
it come to a boil, skim ofl*. all the scum, then coVer 
tight, and simmer five hours. After it has been boiling 
four hours, mix half a cup of flour with cold water and 
add to it. You can then taste it, and add more sea- 
soning if necessary. The spice may be omitted if you 
choose. Serve the meat in a little of the gravy, and 
send the remainder of the gravy to the table in the 
gravy-tureen. Serve plain boiled potatoes, boiled rice, 
and pickled beets. 



46 THE APPLEDORA COOK BOOK. 

Pricassee of Beef. 

Put one pint of water into a frying-pan, and when 
it comes to a boil, thicken with one heaping spoonful 
of flour ; season with salt, pepper and a little butter. 
Cut cold roast beef into slices, and put into this gravy, 
and let them boil five minutes. If there be any cold 
beef gravy, add it to the other, in which case you will 
not need quite so much butter. Serve boiled potatoes, 
tomatoes, boiled rice or macaroni and squash. 

Mutton Ohops. 

Cut the chops from the loin or the neck ; broil as you 
do beefsteak, and serve in hot dishes. Serve mashed 
potatoes, stewed tomatoes, boiled onions and boiled 
rice. 

Mutton Fie with Tomatoes. 

Pare and slice six tomatoes ; put a layer into a deep 
pudding dish, then put in a layer of slices of cold 
mutton, and dredge in flour, salt and pepper. Have 
the last layer tomatoes, over which sprinkle two rolled 
crackers. Bake one hour. Serve boiled potatoes, boiled 
rice, green corn, shelled beans. 

Mutton Pie, Plain. 
Take the cold mutton that has remained from a for« 
mer dinner, cut into thin slices, put into .a pudding 
dish« and season with pepper and salt. Mix two table- 



MEATS. 47 

Apoonfuls of flour with cold water, then pour onto this 
one pint of boiling water, and season with pepper and 
salt, then pour this over the meat. Make a paste by 
rule for plain piecrust, and cover it. Bake one hour. 
Vegetables the same as for pie, with tomatoes, with the 
Addition of stewed tomatoes. 

Mutton Fricassee. 
Mutton fricassee is made the same as beef. Heap 
the meat in the centre of the dish, and garnish the 
sides with boiled rice. Send to the table very hot. 
Serve mashed potatoes, mashed turnips, baked tomatoes 
and shelled beans. 

Haricot of Mutton. 
Take cold mutton (either boiled or roasted), cut into 
slices, and lay in a deep sauce-pan, and then put in 
one fourth of an onion, the same of turnip, and two 
potatoes, and one carrot, all cut into small pieces 
Dredge with flour, salt and pepper. Cover with cold 
water, and boil slowly one hour; then add two spoon- 
fuls of flour mixed with cold water, and boil one hour 
longer. Have a dish ready with an edging of mashed 
potatoes (brown them or not, as you please), and into 
the centre of the dish turn the haricot. Serve mashed 
potatoes, boiled rice, mashed turnips and carrots. 

Minced Mutton. 
Take all the fat from cold mutton, and then put it 
into the chopping-tray ; dredge well with salt, pepper, 



48 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

and flour, and then chop (do not chop it very fine); 
then put into a sauce-pan, and to two pounds of meat 
allow one cup of boiling water and a spoonful of but- 
ter. Let it boil gently fifteen minutes, and dish on 
toast. This is a nice dish for breakfast or dinner. 

Lamb Chops. 

Broil fifteen minutes over clear coals. Season with 
butter, pepper, and salt. 

Broiled Veal. 

Cut veal into thin slices, and broil twenty minutes. 
Season with butter, pepper, and salt. This is the most 
unsavory method of cooking veal, and I would not 
recommend it. 

Fricassee of Veal. 

Fry eight slices of salt pork brown. Take out the 
pork and put in thin slices of veal which have been cut 
from the leg. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and fry 
brown. When all the veal is fried, mix with the boil- 
ing fat two tablespoonfuls of rfr?/ flour; stir until there 
are no lumps, and the flour is brown ; then add twd 
cups of boiling water, and season with salt and pepper. 
Lay the veal in this gravy, and simmer fifteen minutes. 
Dish and pour the gravy over the meat. If for dinner, 
garnish with boiled rice, and serve plain boiled pota- 
toes, spinage, and horseradish. 



MEATS. 49 



Veal Outlets. 

Fry brown eight slices of salt pork. Take them up, 
and add to the fat two large spoonfuls of lard or drip- 
pings, flave ready thin slices of veal (they are best 
cut from the leg), dip them in an egg which has been 
well beaten, then into cracker crumbs, and fry a nice 
brown Season them, before dipping in the egg and 
cracker, with pepper and salt Serve with the salt 
pork. If for dinner, serve mashed potatoes, boiled or 
stewed parnips, and horseradish. 

Veal on Toast. 

Chop the veal as for mutton. Mince and season in 
the same manner. Use a little more water, and boil 
fifteen minutes ; dish on toast, and garnish with thin 
slices of lemon. This is a nice dish for either dinner 
or breakfast. 

Veal Oroquettes. 

Chop cold veal fine (boiled is the nicest), season with 
pepper and salt, and to a quart of veal, after it is 
chopped, add half a cup of warm water (when chop- 
ping the veal, dredge in flour as for veal on toast), 
form this into egg shapes about the size of an egg, 
and dip into a well-beaten egg, then roll in cracker 
crumbs, and fry, as you would doughnuts, in hot lard. 



60 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Pork Steak. 

Cut pork Bteak quite thin, and sprinkle with salt, 
pepper, and a little powdered sage. Put a spoonful of 
drippings or lard in the pan, and lay the pork in it ; 
fry slowly fifteen minutes. Always be sure that the 
meat ij cooked until white at the centre ; if it has a 
pink appearance, it is not done. If for dinner, serve 
boiled potatoes, squash, boiled onions, and apple-sauce. 

Fried Salt Pork. 

Cut salt pork into slices a quarter of an inch thick, 
cut off the rind, and then pour over them boiling 
water, in which let them- stand ten minutes ; then 
turn off the water, and fry until they are brown on 
both sides. 

Broiled Salt Pork. 
Prepare as for fried, and broil ten minutes over clear 

Salt Pork Fried in Batter. 

I-^ry the pork as before directed ; dip in batter, and fry 
ill the pork fat, to which should be added two spoon- 
fuls of drippings or la^d. Make the batter in the fol- 
lowing manner : Mix gradually with one cup of flour, 
one cup of milk, and then add one well- beaten egg and 
a little salt. This makes a pleasant change in the 



MEATS. 61 

country, where it is so diflScult to get fresh meat. 
Serve potatoes and any other vegetable that you please. 

Pried Sausages. 

Cut the sausages apart and wash them ; then lay 
them in the pan and pour boiling water over them ; 
let them boil two minutes, then turn off the water 
and prick the sausages with a fork, or they will burst 
open when they begin to fry. Put a little drippings 
in the pan with them, and fry twenty minutes. Turn 
them often that they may be brown on all sides. Cut 
stale bread into fanciful shapes, fry in the sausage fat, 
and garnish the dish with it. Brown bread is delicious 
fried in this way. Serve plain boiled potatoes, squash, 
mashed turnips, and applesauce. 

Broiled Sausages. 

Scald as for fried, and broil as you would any other 
kind of meat. Sausages that are kept a long time ne- 
come dry and hard ; they are very much improved by 
covering them with boiling water in which half a tea- 
spoonful of saleratus has been dissolved, and boiling 
twenty minutes before frying them. 

Pigs' Peet Soused. 

Scrape and wash the pigs' feet. Clean them, cover 
them with salt and water, and let them stand two days ; 
then turn this water off, and cover again with fresh 



52 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

salt and water ; let them stand two days longer, then boil 
about two hours. When cold, split them, and pour 
over them boiling vinegar, in which there have been 
thrown a few whole cloves, a piece of stick cinnamon, 
and a handful of salt. They will be ready for use in 
twenty-four hours. 

Pried Pigs' Peet. 

Put into the frying-pan four spoonfuls of drippings 
or lard, and when this boils, lay in the feet, first hav- 
ing dredged them with flour, and fry brown. Serve on 
hot dishes. They can be fried bel'ore or after being 
soused Never season them with butter. 

Pigs' Peet Fried in Batter. 

Take the feet from the vinegar and drain them, then 
dip them in a batter made as for pork, and fry in either 
drippinga or lard. 

Pigs* Head Oheese. 

Boil a pigs' head until the bones will drop out. 
When cold, chop fine and season highly with pepper, 
salt, and sage ; then put it into a kettle, and to every 
quart of meat add one half a pint of the liquor in 
which it was boiled. Simmer this slowly for half an 
hour, and turn it into deep earthen dishes, and on top 
place a plate with a weight upon it. Set in a cool 
place, and when cold cut in slices. If there is any 
dangor of its not keeping, scald it over. Many persons 
put spice in it, but it is more natural without. 



MEATS. 63 

Fried Ham. 

Cut the ham in very thin slices, and cut ofi' the rind. 
Have half a spoonful of boiling drippings in the frying- 
pan, lay the ham in this, and fry quickly eight minutes ; 
it will then be brown and crisp. Where the ham is for 
dinner, have the slices larger and thicker, and if you do 
not have eggs with it, fry bread, as directed for saus- 
ages. 

Broiled Ham. 

Out the ham in thin slices ; cut off the rind, and broil 
over clear coals ten minutes. Butter or not, as you 
please. When the ham is very salt or hard, slice, and 
let stand in boiling water ten minutes before frying 
or broiling. 

Ham and Eggs. 

Fry the "ham as before directed, and when the ham 
is all fried, turn the fat into a basin, and scrape the salt 
from the frying-pan; turn back the fat, and add to it 
half a cup of lard. When this comes to a boil, break 
in your eggs, leaving room to turn them, if you prefer 
them turned ; they look much nicer, hcwevcr, when 
they are not turned. If they are not turned, dip up the 
boiling fat while they are cooking and pour over them ; 
they will cook rare in three minutes, well done in four. 
Lay them on the slices of ham, and serve. 



64 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Fried Liver. 

Out either beef or pork liver into slices about half an 
inch thick, and pour boiling vsrater over them, in which 
let them stand twenty minutes ; then drain, and dredge 
with flour, salt, and pepper. Fry six slices of pork 
brown ; take them up, and in the fat fry the liver fifteen 
minutes. Ser\»e the pork with it. 

Broiled Liver. 

Prepare as for frying, and broil fifteen minutes over 
clear coals. Season with butter, salt, and pepper. 
When for dinner, serve boiled or baked potatoes, squash, 
and macaroni. 

Boiled Tripe. 

Wash a tripe clean (it must be washed in several 
waters), and boil ten hours. Turn it often, as it is apt 
to stick to the bottom. After it has boiled seven hours, 
throw a cupful of salt into the boiler with it. When 
eaten plain- boiled, cut up in squares, and serve with 
seasoning of salt, pepper, and butter. 

Broiled Tripe. 

Cut the tripe after it has become cold, into handsome 
squares ; grease the gridiron, and broil ten minutes. 
Season with salt, pepper, and butter. Serve on very 
hot dishes. If you buy tripe, get the honeycomb, as 
that is the nicest part of it. 



MEATS. . 55 

Fried Tripe. 

Cut into handfeomo squares, and drcdp^o with Halt, 
popper, and flour, and fry a light brown, i'l cither drif)- 
pings or lard. 

Soused Tripe. 

Out the tripe into squares, and lay them in an earthen 
pot, and pour over them boiling vinegar enough to 
cover, in which a blade of mace, a dozen whole cloves, 
and a stick of cinnamon have been boiled. It will be 
ready for use in twelve hours, and will keep several 
weeks. Soused tripe may be either broiled, or fried 
plain, or in batter. 

Tripe Fried in Batter. 

Drain the tripe, and make a batter as for pigs* feet; 
dip the tripe in this, and fry in hot drippings or lard. 
Tripo is ni^o cooked in this manner, either before or 
after it has been soused. 

Calf's Head and Fluck. 

Take out tb: brains, and lay them in a dish of cold 
water. Scrape the head and wash, then lay in a tub of 
cold water two hours ; then put into a pot with two 
gallons of cold water. Tic the brains in a cloth, and 
boil with the head. When it comes to a boil, skim care 
fully. When it has boiled two hours, put in the hea^, 



66 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

liver, and feet, and boil two hours longer. When you 
dish, take the bones from the head, and place it in the 
centre of the dish. Cut some slices from the heart and 
liver, and place around the head. Split the feet, and lay 
on the edge of the disli. Serve with brain sauce. To 
make the brain sauce, braid together the brains, half a 
teacup of flour, one teaspoonful of pepper, two of 
salt, one of parsley, one of summer savory. Pour on 
this one pint and a half of boiling water, and let it boil 
twenty minutes, then add one cup of butter and the 
juice of two lemons, and boil five minutes longer. You 
may omit the herbs if you choose. A piece of salt 
poik boiled with the head and pluck is an improve- 
ment, but it is not necessary. The tongue is nice cut 
in thin slices and served cold. The heart, liver, and 
head make a nice hash. Save the liquor to make soup, 
which may be made plain or mock turtle. 

Hash Made from Oalf s Head and Flnck. 

Chop together parts of the head, liver, and heart, in 
the proportion of one third each. Season with pepper, 
salt, a little fresh lemon or a little vinegar. Warm in 
just enough of the liquor in which it was boiled, to 
moisten it. Just before dishing stir in a little butter. 
Serve on toast. 

Meat Hash. 
Chop fine any kind of cold meat (before chopping 



MEATS. 57 

dredge with salt and pepper This is always the best 
manner of seasoning hash, as by this means all parts 
will be seasoned alike). If you have cold potatoes, 
chop fine and mix witli the meat, if they are hot, mash. 
Allow one third meat to two thirds potato. Put this 
mixture in tlie frying-pan with a little water to moisten 
it, and stir in a spoonful of butter, or, if you have nicr 
beef drippings, use that instead of butter. Heat slowly, 
stirring often, and when warmed through, cover and 
let it stand on a moderately hot part of the stove or 
range twenty minutes. When ready to dish, fold as 
you would an omelet, and dish. Save all the trimmings 
and pieces that are left of all kinds of meat, and have 
a hash once or twice a week It does not hurt a hash 
to have different kinds of meat in it. Avoid having a 
hash (or indeed any other part of your cooking) greas3\" 
It is a great mistake to think that seasoning anything 
highly with butter improves it ; on the contrary, it often 
ruins it by disguising the natural flavor, and giving you 
an unhealthy dish. I have nothing to say against a 
moderate use of butter in cooking, but I do strongly 
protest against the immoderate use of it in soups, grav- 
ies, hashes, stews, and on meats and fish of all kinds. 
I do not know of one kind of soup that is improved by 
the addition of butter. 

Observe, when you let steak stand in the oven or on 
the hearth a few minutes after buttering, you will find 
that the butter has become oily, and you have neither 
the flavor of the meat or butter, but an unpleasant oily

flavor. I havft given only the simplest modes of cooking 
meats in this department, and many may think, perhaps, 
that I have been too minute ; but I have not forgotten 
the time when these little hints, as how to put things 
together, as well as the quantities and kinds to take, 
would have been of untold value to me ; and I know 
that every day there are young housekeepers, and young 
girls who have to work in young housekecpciB' kitchens, 
who need just these little hints to make the simplest 
dishes what they should be. For soups, poultry, and 
richer methods of cooking meats, look in the depart- 
ment for rich cooking.

Boiled Potatoes. 

If the potatoes are new, wash clean and yi\ into 
boiling water ; boil thirty minutes, and serve immedi' 
ately. As they grow older, scrape the skin off before 
boiling. For old potatoes, have a sharp knife with a 
thin blade, and pare the potatoes, having the skin as 
thin as possible. They are very much better if they 
stand in cold water a few hours before boiling; then 
put them in boiling water and boil thirty minutes. 
When they have boiled fifteen minutes, throw in a hand- 
ful of salt. When done, turn off the water and let them 
stand on the back part of the range three minutes, then 
shake them up once and turn into the dish, and send 
to the table. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

Prepare and boil as for plain, and then mash. To two 
dozen potatoes add one cup of boiling milk and one 
spoonful of butter. If they arc not salt erongh, add a 
little more. They should be dished as soon as mashed. 
Heap them in the dish in an oval form, smooth and in- 
dent with the knife.

Browned Potatoes. 

Prepare and mash as for plain mashed potatoes ', then 
heap them in an oval form on a buttered tin sheet. 
Smooth with a knife, and then dip the knife in milk and 
Bmooth over again, wetting every part with the milk, 
and place in the oven to brown ; they will brown in 
twenty minutes in a hot oven. I would not recommend 
browning potatoes, as the moisture, being baked in, 
spoils the flavor and renders them clammy. They look 
handsome made into pear shapes and browned. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Be very particular to wash every part of the potato 
clean, as many persons eat the skin. Put them in a 
-pan (have an old one for this purpose), and bake in a 
moderate oven fifty minutes. There is such a difference in 
ovens that each one must learn for herself what the time 
will be for each ; for some will bake iu less time, and 
some will take much longer than the time designated. 

Fried Potatoes. . 

Pare and slice thin raw potatoes, and let them stand 
in cold water several hours ; if in summer, put a piece 
of ice in the water. Cut the slices lengthwise of the po- 
tato. Have ready a basin with boiling drippings or lard, 
drain the potatoes a minute in the cullender, and drop 
them into the boiling fat, and fry a light brown ; take 



VEGETABLES. 61 

them out with a skimmer, and lay them in a dry cul- 
lender, which should be placed in a tin pan and set in 
an open oven. There should be a? much fat as for fry- 
ing doughnuts, and there should not be any more po- 
tatoes put in at a time than will fry brown and not stick 
together. Have the basin in which you fry quite deep, 
as there is danger of the fat boiling over when the po- 
tatoes are put in. When you take the potatoes up, 
dredge a little salt over them. When potatoes are cooked 
in this manner, they will be light and crisp. If they do 
not get cooked enough at first, they are very much im- 
proved by dropping them into the fat for one minute, 
after they have been standing in the oven a while. 

Fried Boiled Potatoee. 

Cut the potatoes into slices, and fry in either pork fat 
or nice drippings. ITave just fat enough in the pan to 
prevent their sticking, and sprinkle with salt while cook- 
ing. When these are brown, take them up and put in 
a little more fat, and fry as before. 

Potatoes warmed with Pork, 

Cut about eight slices of pork into pieces about half 
an inch square, and fry a nice brown. Have ready 
one dozen cold potatoes cut into slices, and turn them 
into the pan with the fried pork, and dredge in a little 
salt and pepper, then stir and cut them into small pieces 
with tlir knife. When a light brown, serve. 



62 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Potatoes warmed in Gravy. 

Slice cold potatoes as for frying, and turn them into 
the frying-pan, and to a dozen potatoes add a pint of 
cold gravy. Season with pepper and salt, and stir, and 
cut with a knife, until they are hot and in small pieces. 

Pricassee of Potatoes. 

Cut cold boiled potatoes into small squares, and put 
them in a basin with milk, pepper, and salt, allowing 
half a pint of milk to a dozen potatoes. Set the basin 
into another of hot water, and when it comes to a boil, 
add a table spoonful of butter, and set on the stove, and 
let it boil up once, then serve. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. 

Wash and boil, with the skins on, forty-five minutes. 
They are much better baked than boiled, and I would 
cook them so generally. 

Baked Sweet Potatoes. 

Wash and wipe dry, and bake one hour. Do not cook 
nqnash when you have sweet potatoes. 

Boiled Onions. 

When new and tender, they will boil in one hour ; 
but after the month of October, they will require two 



VEGETABLES. 63 

hours. Put them into water before peeling them, and 
they will not affect the eyes. Peel of all the dark skin, 
and put them in hot water, and boil as directed. If 
you have milk plenty, half an hour before they are done, 
turn a quart into the water in which they are boiling. 
This makes them white, and is said to prevent, in a 
measure, the disagreeable odor which always follows 
their being eaten. Boil them in a porcelain kettle. 
Dish them whole, and season with a little pepper, salt, 
and butter. 

Fried Onions. 

Peel and slice thin ten good-sized onions, and put them 
in a frying-pan with two spoonfuls of drippings. Fry 
thirty minutes, turning often. 

Boiled Squash. 

Cut the squash in strips, and cut out the soft, stringy 
part ; pare, wash, and cover with boiling water ; boil 
twenty-five minutes, then turn into a cullender for a fe\* 
minutes, and when all the water is drained off, put it 
back in the basin with a little salt, pepper, and butter, 
and mash. Dish the same as mashed potatoes. 

Baked Squash. 

Cut the squash in two , take out of all the soft, stringy 
part ; if you need the whole squash for dinner, lay the 
halves together, and put in a baking-pan (the old one you 



64 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

use for baking potatcs in), and bake forty-five minutes. 
\yijeii done, ecrape Ihc squash from the shell, and sea- 
son, and serve as boiled squash. When you cook but 
half a squash, lay it with the inside downward. This is 
a nice way to ( ook watery squash. Squash is also good 
steamed. It will take forty-five minutes to steam. 

Beets. 

Wash clean, but do not scrape ; if you do they will 
look white when cooked. When young they will cook 
in two hours ; but old ones will require four or five 
hours. When don^, plunge them into cold water, and 
the skin will peel ofi" easily. Cut in thin slices, and 
lay in a flat dish. 

Pickled Beets. 

Cut the beets that are left from dinner into thin slices, 
and lay them in an earthen vessel, and cover with cold 
vinegar and a few whole cloves. Keep in a cold place. 

Shelled Beans. 

Wash in several waters, and put them in a basin with 
boiling water. Boil one hour. Do not drain them very 
dry. Season with butter and salt. 

Baked Beans. 

Examine and wash one quart of dry beans (the pea 
bean is the best), and put them in a pan with six quarts 



VEGETABLES. 65 

of cold water ; let them soak in this over night. In 
the morning wash them in another water, and place 
them on the fire with six quarts of cold water and a 
pound of mixed salt pork. If they are the present year's 
beans, they will cook enough in half an hour ; if older, 
one hour. Drain them and put half in the bean-pot ; then 
gash the pork, and put in the remainder of the beans, 
one tablespoonful of molasses, and one of salt, and cover 
with boiling water. Bake ten hours. Watch them care- 
fully, and do not let them cook dry. 

String Beans. 

String and cut into pieces about an inch long ; then 
wash and put into boiling water, and boil one hour. 
Season with salt and butter. 

Stewed Beans. 

Wash and soak over night one quart of beans. (Scar- 
let runners are the best.) In the morning set them on 
the fire with six quarts of cold water and one and a 
half pounds of mixed salt pork. They will cook in four 
hours, but are better cooked five. Stir them often to 
prevent burning. Season with pepper before dishing, 
and if the pork does not season it enough, add a little 
salt. 

Green Peas. 

Put them into boiling water, and when very young 
they will cook in twenty minutes ; but generally they 
require thirty. Season with salt and butter. 



66 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Green Oorn. 

Boil twenty-five minutes, if very young and tender. 
As It grows older it requires a longer time. Send to 
the table in a napkin. 

Boiled Turnips. 

Peel and cut into slices. If they are to be served in 
slices, boil with a small piece of pork. Boil the pork 
three hours, and put in the turnips ; if they arc the 
white turnip, they will cook in forty-five minutes ; but 
if the yellow, they' will require two hours Serve in 
slices without any seasoning except what they get by 
being boiled with the pork. For mashed, cook in the 
same way, omitting the pork, and season with salt, pep- 
per, and butter. When the white turnip is very watery, 
it is improved by mashing a few mealy potatoes with 
it. Dish as directed for mashed potato. 

Boiled Parsnips. 

Scrape very clean, and cut lengthwise into slices. 
Put them into a stew-pan, and cover with water, and 
boil one hour. Serve with a little drawn butter. 

Pried Parsnips. 

Prepare as before directed, and boil half an hour. 
Let them grow cold, and fry a light brown in pork fat 
(Never use butter to fry.) They are very nice cooked 
whole with a piece of pork, as you cook turnips. Th^ 



VEGETABLES. 67 

time to eat parsnips is in April and May, and they 
should be dug fresh when used. Dig a large box full 
in the fall, and cover them with earth. Use these for 
soups ; they are one of the nicest vegetables that there 
are for flavoring soups. 

Boiled Carrots. 
Prepare, boil, and serve the same as parsnips. 

Boiled Eice. 

Wash and pick all the specks from a cup of rice. 
Let it stand in cold water two hours, and then put it in 
a deep kettle, with two quarts of water, and boil fast 
thirty minutes. When it has boiled twenty minutes, 
throw in a great spoonful of salt. When done, turn 
into a cullender, and set in the oven a few minutes. 
When ready to dish, shake lightly and turn into the 
vegetable dish. Never use a spoon. If these directions 
are followed, you will have a handsome and healthy 
vegetable, and every kernel will be separate. The 
water in which the rice has been boiled makes a nice 
starch for colored clothes. 

The southern rice cooks much quicker and is nicer than 
the Indian rice. If possible, always purchase the former. 

Another Mode. 

Wash one cupful of rice and put into a tin basin or 
pail, with three cupfuls of cold water, and a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, cover and set in another basin, with hot water. 



^8 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

place on the fire, and boil thirty minutes. Rice is very 
lealthy, and should be a common dish on the table. 



Stewed Tomatoes, 

Pour boiling water over half a peck of ripe tomatoes, 
^et them stand in it five minutes, and then peel off the 
(jkins ; cut them into slices, and put in a stew-pan with 
a little salt, pepper, and a spoonful of sugar. Simmer 
two hours, stirring often to prevent burning. Two min- 
ates before dishing stir in one tablespoonful of butter. 
Canned tomatoes are cooked in the same manner, but 
do not require more than half an hour to stew. 



Sliced Tomatoes. 

Pour boiling water over them, and then peel and slice 
thin ; lay them on small platters, and serve. Let each 
person season to his own taste. 

Baked Tomatoes. 

Scald and peel as directed ; have ready an earthen 
dish, into which lay a layer of tomatoes (whole), then 
sprinkle with salt, pepper, and cracker crumbs ; then 
another layer of tomatoes, and sprinkle again witli salt 
and pepper. Cut a spoonful of butter into small pieces 
and lay on the tomatoes, and then cover with cracker 
crumbs Bake thirty minutes. 



VBGETABLBS. 69 



Cut off the white part, wash and tie in small bunches, 
and put into a sauce-pan wiih boiling water enough to 
cover it, and a handful of salt When young it will 
boil in twenty minutes ; ii not tender, boil thirty. Dish 
on toast, and season with a little butter. 

Spinage. 

Pick carefully and see that there are no weeds or 
grass in it ; then wash in several waters. Put on to 
boil in boiling water, and boil an hour and a half. 
When about half done, throw into the water a spoon- 
ful of salt. When done, drain and put in a dish with 
a little butter, and cut it several times with a knife. 
Dish and garnish with slices of hard-boiled egg. You 
can boil it with a piece of salt pork, and then you will 
not require the butter and eggs. 

Oabbage. 

Cut the stalk and all the loose leaves from the cab- 
bage; then cut the cabbage into four parts, and wash 
clean Examine it carefully, as there are worms in* it 
sometimes. Put it in a deep pan, and pour boiling water 
over U, and let it stand in the shed (that it may not 
scent the house) half an hour. Boil with a small piece 
of salt pork two hours, or you can boil it with corned 
beef, as many persons do ; but it has not the white 
appearance that it has when boiled with pork When 



70 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

cold, it is nice warmed with a little of the drippiDgs 
of corned beef. 

Cauliflower. 

Cut off the loose leaves and the stock; wash clean, 
and let it stand in cold water one hour ; then put on 
to boil in boiling water, and if very large, boil one 
hour and a half; but if small, one hour will answer. 
When nearly done, stir in a spoonful of salt and half 
a pint of milk. Serve whole in a deep dish, and 
spread over it a little butter. The milk can be omitted, 
as its only use is to whiten the cauliflower. 

Dandelions. 

Pick over carefully, and wash in several waters ; cut 
off" all the roots, then put into boiling water, and boil 
one hour; then drain off this water, and again put them 
into boiling water, and boil two hours longer. Put a 
spoonful of salt into the second water. When done, turn 
into a cullender and drain ; then season with butter and 
more «alt if necessary, and cut them with a knife. 
Serve in a deep vegetable dish. They may be boiled 
with a piece of salt pork, but in that case omit the butter. 

Beet Greens. 

Scrape the roots and wash in several waters ; then 
let them stand in cold water a few hours. Boil a small 
piece of salt pork three hours, then put the beet greens 
into the kettle with it, and boil one hour longer.

Macaroni Boiled. 

Break up and wash a pint bowl full of macaroni, jjnd 
put in a shallow basin, and cover with cold water. 
Set this basin into another of warm water, and place on 
tfte fire ; after fifteen minutes, add a pint of milk and a 
teaspoonful of salt; let it cook ten minutes longer, 
then add a spoonful of butter, and cook five minutea 
more, and dish. Be careful not to break the macaroni 
in dishing. The boiled macaroni which remains from 
one dinner can be used for the next, by preparing it 
in the following manner : Butter a shallow dish, and 
turn the macaroni into it ; then grate over it old cheese, 
and brown. 



BREAD. 

Always purchase the best flour ; it is much cheaper 
than the low priced. Keep a large tin pan or wooden 
bowl full of sifted flour, and always keep the flour 
covered Have two quarts, one for dry, and the other 
for liquid measuring. The old beer measure is the 
kind to get. If you buy milk, it will not do to con- 
sider the milkman's quart for any rule in this book. 
You must always measure with the beer measure. 
Oood bread is the most important branch of cooking. 
Therefore I hope every housekeeper, who cannot already 
make good bread, will give particular attention to this 
branch before attending to cake or pastry of any kind. 
It seems as if enough had been written and said, in 
regard to this subject, to awaken every young woman 
to the importance of it ; but it is not so. If a young 
lady learns to do any kind of cooking, it is cake and 
pastry, and if she learns to make bread, it is the last 
thing, instead of the first, to be learned. Now I cer- 
tainly think that no girl should pass her eighteenth 
year without a practical knowledge of bread-making, 
cooking vegetables and plain meats. 1 have no objec- 
tions to all the nice fancy cooking, which any one may 
learn afterwards ; but have bread, vegetables, and meats 
first. When reading a rule for doing anything, it seems 

72 



I 



BREAD. 73 

as if the process were longer and harder than when th« 
rule is very short. But I hope none will feel so because* 
I have gone into all the details, for I feel that it is be- 
cause of the neglect of the small things that so many- 
fail in cooking, as in everything else. 

Hop Yeast. 
Pare and boil one dozen mealy potatoes (they will 
boil in thirty minutes); as soon as you put the potatoes 
>n to boil, put a handful of hops into another kettle with 
three quarts of coZ^ water, cover and boil (watch it that 
it may not boil over). When the potatoes are boiled, 
drain and mash fine ; then strain the hops through a 
fine sieve on the potatoes (be sure that the hops are 
boiling when they are strained on the potatoes), and stir 
well ; then add one half a cup of sugar, one fourth of 
salt, and one pint of flour ; mix this well and strain 
through a cullender ; let it stand until it is milk-warm, 
then stir in one cup of good yeast, and set it to rise 
where it will be warm. It will rise in five hours if the 
yeast is good. You can tell when it is risen by the 
white foam, which will rise to the top When risen, put 
it in a stone jug, and stop tight It is a good plan to 
tie the cork down, as it sometimes flies out. Set in the 
ice chest or on the cellar bottom. Make one third this 
quantity in summer if your family be small. 

Hop Yeast, No. 2. 
In the spring and the first of the summer, when 
potatoes are poor, it is better to make yeast without 



74 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

*hem. Boil one fourth of a cup of hops in one quart of 
water, and strain it upon a half a pint of flour ; stir 
this well, and add two spoonfuls of sugar and one of 
salt, then strain through a cullender, and let it become 
milk-warm, when add one cup of good yeast. You 
need just as much yeast for one third the quantity 
made without potatoes, as you would for the whole 
made with potatoes. Rise and bottle the same as the 
preceding. 

'^^cato Yeast. 

Pare and boil six good-sized potatoes ; when done, 
mash, and pour on them three pints of boiling water; 
run this tlirough the cullender, and then stir in one 
spoonful of sugar and one of salt. When milk-warm, 
stir in half a cup of yeast. In summer time this will 
rise in three or four hours. It will not keep as long as 
hop yeast. 

Yeast Bread. 

Take four good-sized potatoes, peel, boil, and mash, 
and pour on to them one quart of boiling water ; strain 
the whole through a sieve ; let this get blood-warm, and 
then stir into it one cup of yeast, one spoonful of white 
sugar, one spoonful of salt, and three quarts and a pin* 
of flour. Beat well with a spoon and set in a warm plac« 
to rise. (In the summer it will rise in four hours, in 
winter it will take five.) When well risen, take a pint of 
flour and put part of it on the kneading-board ; then turn 
\he dough upon the board, and put one spoonful of lard 



BREAD. 76 

on it ; then knead twenty minutes, using the pint of 
flour ; now put the dough in the pan again, and let it 
rise one hour, and then form into loaves. (Do not have 
over a pint bowl full of dough in a loaf.) Let the loaves 
rise forty minutes, and bake forty-five minutes. Bread 
made in this way cannot be excelled ; the only objection 
to it is that you have to bake in the afternoon; but 
when good bread is wanted, a little extra work should 
not prevent it being made. 

Yeast Bread, Ko. 2. 

Make a hole in the middle of four quarts of flour, into 
which turn one spoonful of sugar, one of salt, and one 
cup of yeast ; then mix with one pint of cold milk, which 
has been warmed by the addition of one pint of boiling 
water, and add one spoonful of lard ; knead well, and 
let it rise over night. In winter, let it begin to rise near 
the fire the first of the evening, unless your kitchen is 
very warm But in summer do not mix until nine, un- 
less you intend baking before breakfast. In the morning 
knead again, and make into loaves ; let them rise one 
hour, and bake fifty minutes. If you have not plenty of 
milk, mix with water, and use one spoonful more of lard. 
There is a great deal in knowing how to knead ; strengtk 
is not all, as many suppose. When you put the bread 
on the board, mix it lightly, and when you begin tv 
knead it, do not press down, but let all your motions be 
as elastic as possible ; knead with tlw) palm of the hand 
until the dough is a flat cake, then fol^ and keep doing 



76 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

this until the dough is emooth and elastic ; twenty min- 
utes is the time 1 have given, but many persouo can knead 
the bread in less time, while others will require longer. 
But practice will teach each one. 

Milk Yeast Bread. 
Put into a two-quarts-and-a-pint pail one pint of new 
milk, and one pint of boiling water ; mix with this one 
tablespoonful of white sugar, one of salt, and three pints 
of flour. Beat this well together, and cover tight (nave 
a spoon that is so short that you can put the cover on the 
pail while it is in it, and yet it must be long enough to 
come nearly to the top.) Set this pail into another pail, 
or kettle, with water enough to come nearly to the to,- ^f 
it. To get this water the right temperature, take one hah 
cold and one half boiling water ; set it where it will keep 
about the same temperature until risen ; watch carefully, 
and beat the batter as often as once in every half hour 
until the last hour, when it must not be disturbed. This 
will rise in about five hours ; when it is risen the pail 
wi.l be lull. Do not let it stand one minute after that, as 
it spoils very quickly. Have in a pan two quarts of 
flour, make a hole in the middle of it. Dissolve a teaspoon- 
ful of saleratus in a little hot water, and when the batter 
is risen turn it into the middlft of the flour, and tum the 
saleratus in with it ; then knead well, and make into 
loaves. Set them where they will be warm, and let them 
rise forty-five minutes. Bake in a quick oven. It will take 
nearly a pint of flour to knead the dough on the board. 



BREAD. 77 

Be as particular to raeisure. your flour as you are to 
measure fbe milk and water. This bread is not so health- 
ful as hu;. vcast bread, and is more difiScult to make ; but 
it makes the nicest dry toast and delicious sandwiches. 

Graham Bread. 

Take two quarts of Graham (never sift it) and one of 
flour, half a cup of yeast, one scant spoonful of salt, half 
a cup of brown sugar, and warm water enough to make a 
stiif batter, and let it rise. If you rise it over night, be 
sure to set it in a cool place, as it sours much quicker 
than fine flour. It will rise in a warm place in four 
hours. When risen, mix with it a teaspoonful of saleratus 
dissolved in warm water, and flour enough to shape it 
into loaves ; put it in the pans, and let it rise thirty- 
five minutes, and bake .slowly an hour and a quarter. 
Make the loaves very small. Use molasses instead of 
sugar if the bread is eaten for constipation. 

Third Bread. 
Take one quart of flour, one of Indian meal, one of rye, 
one cup of yeast, one spoonful of salt, half a cup of 
brown sugar, and nearly a quart of warm water ; mix well 
together, and let it rise over night In the morning use 
flour enough to shape it into loaves, and let it rise in the 
baking-pans forty-five minutes. Bake one hour and a 
quarter. 

Brown Bread. 
Take one heaping pint bowlful of rye meal, two of 
Indian, one cup of yeast, one of molasses, one spoonful 



78 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

of salt, one teaspoonful saleratus. Mix with warm 
water, as thick as hasty-pudding. Lard the dish in 
which it is to be baked, aud then turn in the mixture ; let 
it rise two hours, and bake in a slow oven four hours. 

Brown Bread, No. 2. 

Very nice. Three cups of Indian meal, three of rye, 
one half of molasses, one spoonful of salt, one teaspoon- 
ful of saleratus ; wet with one quart and a fourth of 
railk. Steam five or six hours. This will make enough 
to fill a two quart pan. 

Brown Bread, No. 3. 

Nice. One pint of sour milk, half a cup of molasses, 
one teaspoonful saleratus, one tablespoonful salt, half In- 
dian and half rye meal enough to make a stiff batter ; 
lard the baking-tin well, and turn in the mixture. Steam 
five hours. I will say here that you cannot steam brown 
bread too much ; but do not steam it less than five hours, 

Eaised Biscuit. 

If the biscuit are for breakfast, take part of the dough 
of yeast bread No. 2, and mould with the hands very 
small cakes, place them in a shallow pan, and rise one 
hour. Bake in a quick oven thirty minutes. Never cut 
raised biscuit with a cutter ; they arc enough nicer for 
being moulded by the hand to pay for the extra labor. 
When the biscuit are for tea, take part of the dough of 



BREAD. Ty 

No. 1, and proceed as directed for breakfast biscuit. 
When the supper hour is six, do not set your broad until 
ten, if in summer, but if in winter, lialf past ciglit Hogin 
to make the biscuit two hours before euppor-timo ; hj 
this means you will have plenty of time to rise tln^m 
Shape the loaves at the same time, and they can be 
baked while you are getting supper. 

Raised Biscuit, No. 2. 
Take three quarts of flour and one cup of butter, one 
of yeast, one spoonful of salt, one of sugar. Melt the 
butter and mix with a scant quart of warm milk ; wet 
the flour with this, and set in a warm place to rise. 
When it cracks open it is risen enough. When it is 
risen, work into it two teaspoonfuls of saleratus which 
have been dissolved in half a cup of hot water. You 
must work it very thoroughly, or the saleratus will not be 
mixed with every part. Now^put the dough into large tin 
pans or pails (do not have the vessels more than half full, 
as the dough will rise again), and set them on the ice. 
This dough will not be fit to use under twelve hours, 
as it must be chilled through. W^hen you wish to 
make biscuit, take part of this dough and lay on the 
paste board, and roll about an inch thick ; cut in small 
cakes, and bake fifteen minutes in a quick oven. Handle 
the dough as little as possible, and keep very cold 
until ytyU put it in the oven This is a very nice way 
to make biscuit where the family have hot bread twice 
a day, as it will keep five days ; but tber*^ must b* a 
good ice-chest, and plenty of ice to have it work well.

White' Mountain Rolls. 

For breakfast. Sixteen cups of flour, one half a cup 
of white Bugar, one cup of butter, one of yeast, the 
whites of four eggs beaten to a stiflf froth, and four 
cups of boiled milk. Melt the butter, have the milk blood- 
warm, and mix the bread; set in a warm place, and 
rise over night; in the morning shape into long rolls 
rise one hour, and bake half an hour.

pint of cold boiled milk and half a cup of yeast Cover 
the pan, and let it stand all night ; in the morning 
stir it up and knead well, and set in a warm place to 
rise ; let it rise to a light opungo (it will rise in an 
hour a half), then roll it out on the board about half 
an inch thick ; cut with an oval cutter, and fold about 
two thirds of it ; lay them on tin sheets ; let them 
rise an hour, and then bake in a quick oven fifteen 
minutes. If you have breakfast at seven, you must bo 
up at four to have them ready. 

Coffee Rolls.

o'clock in the afternoon, then shape into long rolls, as 
you do White Mountain rolls, and let them rise one 
hour and a half Bake half an hour in a moderate oven 
When done, glaze them with a little milk in whicli a 
little brown sugar has been dissolved, and set them 
back in the oven for two minutes. These are for tea 
Thev are nice, sliced thin, when cold.

Soda Biscuit. 
Take one quart of flour, before it is sifted, and put 
into the sieve, and with it one teaspoonful of saleratus, 
two of cream of tartar, one of salt, and one tablespoon- 
ful of white sugar. Mix all these thoroughly with the 
flour ; then run through the sieve, and then rub in one 
spoonful of lard or butter. Wet with a little over half 
a pint of milk. Roll on the board about an inch thick ; 
cut with a biscuit cutter, and bake in a quick oven 
fifteen minutes. If you have not milk, use a littlo more 
butter, and wet with water. Handle as little and 
make as rapidly as possible. 

Cream of Tartar EoUs.

together, then run them through the sieve ; wet with 
half a pint of milk. Heat and grease the French roll 
pan, and put a large spoonful into every compartment ; 
set into a hot oven, and bake fifteen minutes. This 
quantity will make just one roll pan full. 

Sour Milk Biscuit. 
Rub half a spoonful of butter or lard into one quart 
of flour, and wet it with one quart of sour milk, into 
which you have previously stirred one teaspoonful of 
saleratus, which had been dissolved in a little hot water. 
Use as much more flour as you find necessary to make 
the dough stiff enough to roll out. Roll on the board 
about an inch thick and cut with a biscuit cutter. Bake 
in a quick oven. If you use lard for shortening, add 
one teaspoonful of salt. 

Buttermilk Rolls. 
Take two coffee cups of buttermilk, and stir into it 
one teaspoonful of saleratus dissolved in a little hot 
water, and stir into this about five cups of flour ; beat

eggs, r nd butter the size of an egg. Boat the butter 
and sugar together, and then add the eggs well beaten ; 
with Ifeis mix the milk, and then beat in the flour in 
which the saleratus and cream of tartar have been 
mixed. Bake in buttered muffin rings in a quick oven. 

G-riddle Cakes. 

Sour Milh or Buttermilk Cakes. 

Two coffee cups of sour milk or buttermilk, one tea- 
spoonful of saleratus dissolved in a little hot water, and 
flour enough to pour. Grease the griddle with a piece 
of fat salt pork, and fry the cakes a light brown. 

Bice Cakes. 

Make with sour milk, as directed above, and add two 
well-beaten eggs, one cup of boiled rice, and one tea- 
spoonful of salt. They require a longer time to fry than 
the plain do, but are very nice. 

Indian Cakes. 

Make as the first, using half flour and half Indian 
meal, and one teaspoonful of salt. These require a 
longer time to fry than when made with all flour. 



BREAD. 87 

Corn Dodgers. 

Take three teacups of Indian meal, one teaspoon ful 
of salt, one tablespoonful of sugar, and pour on boiling 
water enough to wet it ; then make into small flat cakes 
about an inch thick, and fry in boiling fat until brown. 
They will fry in fifteen or twenty minutes. To be eaten 
very hot. 

Bread Cakes. 

Take stale* bread and soak it in milk; when soft, run 
it through a cullender. To one quart of this add one 
teaspoonful of saleratus, two eggs, one cup of flour, one 
teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 
half a nutmeg. These also take some time to cook. 
The eggs may be omitted if you choose, but you must 
\hen use half a cup more of flour. 

Buckwheat Cakes. 

One pint of warm water, half a cup of yeast, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, half a cup of Indian meal, two table- 
spoonfuls of molasses, and buckwheat enough to make a 
thin batter ; let this rise over night ; in the morning 
sift in one teaspoonful of saleratus, and fry. If you 
have them every morning, save a little of the batter to 
rise them with, instead of using fresh yeast every time. 
The Indian meal may be omitted if you prefer them 
without ; in this case use a little more buckwheat. 
They may be made with sour milk, as the flour are

made, hv substituting buckwheat for flour ; but they are 
not 60 good as when raised. Buckwheat is so fine that 
care must be taken to stir and beat well from the bot- 
tom, or there will be lumps of dry buckwheat there. 

Fried Mush. 

Into one quart of boiling water stir one tablespoonful 
of salt, and one cup of flour mixed with one quart of 
Indian meal (it may -take a little more than a quart of 
meal to make it stiff enough); beat it well, or it will 
bn lumpy. Boil gently two hours, and then turn into 
dishes which have been dipped in cold water, and set 
away to cool. Pans in which you bake loaves of bread 
are the best to cool it in, as it then makes handsome 
slices In the morning cut into slices an inch thick, 
and fry brown in pork fat. Serve slices of fried pork 
with it You caa cook enough at one time for several 
breakfasts. If you do not wish to fry the mush, do not 
use the flour, and do not make quite so stiff. 

Brown Bread Brewis, 

If you bake brown bread there will be a great deal 
of hard crust. Take this crust and put in a basin with 
a little salt, and cold water enough to cover it; cover 
tight, and set on the fire to boil ; boil fifteen or twenty 
minutes, and serve in a deep dish. It must be dry and 
soft This is very nice eaten with cold corned beef or 
cold tongue ; it can also be eaten with milk or sirup.

eratus and cream of tartar have been thoroughly mixed. 
Turn it, about an inch deep, into shallow pans, and 
bake in a quick oven. To be eaten warm. 

Berry Oake. 

Make the same as tea cake, only measure the pint 
of flour before it is sifted, and stir in one pint of blue 
berries 

Plain Oup Oake. 

Half a cup of butter, one of sugar, three of flour, one 
of milk, three eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, two 
of cream of tartar, and lemon or nutmeg to taste. Beat 
the butter light, then add the sugar gradually, beating 
all the time until it is a cream, and then add the eggs, 
which have been beaten light, and the milk ; mix all 

89 



90 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

these well together, and then stir in the flour, in which 
the saleratus and cream of tartar have been mixed. 
Flavor and bake either in loaves or sliects ; when done, 
the place on top where it has cracked open will look 
well done. If baked in loaves, it will take forty min- 
utes ; in sheets, twenty. This quantity will make two 
small loaves. 

Eicher Oup Oake. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, one of milk, four 
of. flour, one tcaspoonful of cream of tartar, half of saU

flour, one egg, one tablespoonful of butter, half a tea 
spoonful of saleratus, one of cream of tartar, and flavor 
to taste. Soften (but do not melt) the butter, and beat 
it with the sugar and egg ; then add the milk, and then 
the flour mixed with the saleratus and cream of tartar.

of cloves. Beat sugar and butter together, then add 
molasses and spice, then the sour milk in which the sal- 
eratus is dissolved, and then the flour, and last the rai- 
sins. Bake in loaves in a moderate oven. If the raisins 
are not stoned, chop them. It is much better, however, 
to stone them. 

Baisin Cake. 

One cup of molasses, one of butter, one of milk, three 
of flour, two of chopped raisins, and one teaspoonful of 
saleratus. Spice to your taste. Soften the butter and 
beat it and the molasses together; then add milk, and 
then the flour in which the saleratus is mixed, and 
lastly the raisins. Bake in loaves in a moderate oven.

PLAIN CAKE. 98 

Eicli Molasses Gingerbread. 

Two cups of molasses, two of milk, one of melted 
butter, two and a lialf teaspuonfuls of saleratus, three 
eggs, one tablespoonful of gniger, and one iiutnieg, one 
cup of sugar, and eight cups of flour. Beat molasses, 
butter, sugar, and eggs together ; then dissolve the sal- 
eratus in the milk, and add it with flour, ginger, and 
nutmeg ; beat up well, and pour about two inches deep 
into pans, and bake half an hour. This will keep well, 
but being nearly as expensive as cup cake, I would 
rather make it plainer and oftener. 

Soft Molasses Q-ingerbread, No. 2. 

One cup of molasses, one teaspoonful of saleratus, one 
of ginger, one tablespoonful of butter or lard, a pinch 
of salt, if you use lard. Stir this together, and then 
pour on one half a cup of boiling water, one pint of 
flour. Bake about one inch deep in a sheet. This ia 
very nice if pains are taken to h^ve the watp' ^oiling, 
and to beat it well when the flour is added. 

Soft Molasses Gingerbread, No. 3. 

One cup of molasses, one of sugar, one of sour milk, 
one tablespoonful of ginger, half of .^^aleratus, one egg, 
and flour enough to make a thick batter. Bake aboul

Hard Molasses Gingerbread. 

Odo pint of molasses, half a cup of lard or butter, 
I lalf a tablespoojiful of salt when you use lard), one 
itiblespoonful of ginger, one of saleratus ; beat all this 
together, and when well mixed add half a pint of cold 
water, and flour enough to roll. Roll this very thin 
and cut in strips about three inches wide and six long, 
with a jagging-i on, and bake in a quick oven until 
brown. When you take them from the oven, lay them 
on a sieve to cool, and when cold, put them in a tin 
box that can be covered tight ; keep this in a dry 
closet, and they will keep nice and crispy for a month. 

Hard Sugar Gingerbread. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, one of sour milk, 
two eggs, one tablespoonful of ginger, one teaspoonful of 
saleratus, and flour enough to roll. Beat the sugar and 
butter to a cream, then beat in the eggs, ; add the ginger 
and sour milk in which the saleratus is dissolved, and then 
the flour Roll about half an inch thick ; cut, bake, and 
keep the same as directed for hard molasses gingerbread. 

Ginger Snaps. 

One cup of molasses, one of butter, one of sugar, one 
tablespoonful of ginger, and two eggs. Put the molas- 
ses and butter in a tin pan, and set one the fire ; when 
it boils up, take off, and add the sugar and ginger. 



PLAIN CAKE. 95 

When they are well mixed, add the eggs, which have 
been well beaten, and then flour enough to roll. Put 
a ismall piece at a time on the board, and roll as thin as 
the blade of a knife ; cut into round cakes, and bake in 
a quick oven until they are a dark brown. Cool, and 
keep in a tin box, the same as hard gingerbread. 

Molasses Cookies. 

One cup of molasses, one of brown sugar, one of 
lard, one half of boiling water, one spoonful of ginger, 
one of saleratus, one of salt, and flour enough to roll. 
Beat sugar, lard, molasses, saleratus, and ginger to- 
gether ; then pour on the boiling water, and mix in the 
flour. Roll about three quarters of an inch thick, and 
cut with a round cutter. Bake in a quick oven. 

Vinegar Oookies. 

Two cups of molasses, one of butter or lard, two eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one of ginger, one of sal- 
eratus, and flour enough to roll. Roll about half an inch 
thick, cut into round cakes, and bake in a quick oven. 

Sugar Oookies. 

One cup of sugar, half a cup of butter, one cup of 
milk, two eggs, half a nutmeg, one teaspoonful saleratus, 
and flour enough to roll. Beat sugar and butter to a 
creafl), then add the eggs, well beaten, dissolve the sal- 
eratus in the milk, and stir that in. then the flour. 



1f6 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Jumbles. 
Three cups of sugar, two of butter, three eggs, one 
teaspoonful of saleratus, four tablespoonfuls of soui 
cream, and flour enough to roll. Beat sugar and butter 
to a cream, then add the eggs, which are well beaten, 
then the sour cream in which the saleratus is dissolved. 
Flavor with anything you please. Cut with an oval 
cutter. If you have a cutter that takes a piece out of 
the centre, use that When you roll them, sift over 
the dough, before you cut it, granulated sugar, and then 
roll the pin lightly over it. This is a much better waj 
than to sift the sugar on after the cakes are put in the 
pan, for when sifted in the pan it burns on it and 
spoils the looks of the pan and cakes. Great care must 
be taken in baking all kinds of cakes which you roll 
on the board, us they burn very quickly ; and agaiii, 
if they are not baked enough, they will not be nice, 
keep well, or be healthful. Where there are children, 
this is the most economical way to make cake, but 
takes more time ; and also in families where they do 
not care for cake, they are nice to keep in case of un- 
expected company. 

Plain Douglmuts. 
One pint of flour, half a cup of sugar, one spoonful 
of butter, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one half 
of saleratus, half a nutmeg, and milk enough to wet 
and roll. Soften the butter and mix with the milk (about 
one cupful) ; mix the sugar, saleratus, cream of tartar, 



PLAIN CAKE. 97 

and the nutmeg with the flour, and stir into the butter 
and milk After beating well with the spoon, pot on 
the board, roll about an inch thick, and cut in any 
shujK? you please. Have ready boiling lard or drippings, 
and fry until done, which will be in about eight minutes. 
The addition of two eggs is an improvement, but not 
necessary. When you have finished frying, cut a pota- 
to in slices a:id put in the fat to clarify it, then set 
the kettle une side until it settles, then strain into an 
earthen pot (keep one on purpose for this), and set in 
a cool place. The sediments which remain in the bot- 
tom put in the soap-grease. Many persons fry dough- 
nuts in the common frying-pan, but there is not depth 
enough to it. It is much better, if you have not au 
iron kettle that is deep enough, to use a tin basin. 

Eaised Doughnuts. 

One cup of sweet milk, one spoonful of butter, four 
of yeast, four of sugar, half a nutmeg, and flour to 
make a stiff* batter ; let this rise over night. In the 
morning roll out, cut in strips, with a jagging-iron, about 
four inches long and two wide, and fry. Common 
raised dough makes very nice ones to be eaten as soon as 
fried, either for breakfast or tea. 

Doughnuts should not be eaten before November or 
after April ; indeed, they are not very healthful to eat 
at any time Keep covered in a stone pot in the cellar. 



PUDDINGS. 

Boiled Eice. 

Pick and wash clean one cupful of rice, and put into

gjpoonful of cinnamon, and four of sugar. Set this in 
the oven, and stir once in every half hour ; after it has 
been baking two hours stir in milk enough to fill the 
dish, and bake one hour longer (the dish should be 
nearly full of milk at first). Serve with sugar and milk. 

Minute Pudding.

flour, one teaspoonful of salt, two eggs. Set the milk 
into a basin of hot water, and when it comes to a boil 
add to it one pint of boiling water. Have ready the flour, 
made into a smooth paste with one cup of milk, and mix 
with this paste, after they are well beaten, the two eggs ; 
now take the basin in which the milk and water are, 
and set upon the fire ; let it boil up once, and then stir 
in the thickening ; beat it well, that it may be smooth, 
and cook three minutes longer. Serve with vinegai 
sauce. 



100 THE APPLEDORE COOK B601C. 

Corn Starch Pudding. 

One quart of milk, six tablespoonfuls of corn starch, 
three eggs, one teaspoonful of salt Put the milk in a 
basin, and set the basin into a ketlle with boiling water, 
and when it comes to a boil stir in the corn starch and 
L'gg?i, which prepare in the following manner : Wet the 
corn starch with one cup of cold milk, and then stir into 
it the eggs which are well beaten After the starch is 
added to the boiling milk it will cook in three minutes : 
beat well to make smooth. Serve with sugar and cream 
or wine sauce. Never add the eggs after the starch 
has been stirred into the boiling milk ; if you do the 
egg will be in spots in it. 

Quaking Pudding. 

Take as much stale bread as will fill a quart basin after 
It is cut ; now butter well a tin mould or pail that will 
cover tight, and put in a layer of bread ; then strew in a 
few raisins, and then bread, and so on until the bread is 
all u^ed (the bread must be cut very thin). Make a cus- 
tard of three pints of milk and six eggs, and season with 
salt and nutmeg ; turn this on the bread, and set away 
in a coi>l place two hours, and then set in a steanicr and 
steam three. Serve with wine sauce. This may be 
boiled in a pudding-cloth. When boiled, prepare the 
eame as for steaming, omitting the buttering of the dish, 
and let it soak two hours and a half, then turn into the 
Dudding-cloth, tie tight, and boil two hours and a half.

Make the same as plain corn starch pudding, using the 
yolks (if six eggs Butter a pudding-dish, and turn the 
pudding into it (do not fdl within lliree inches of the top 
of the dish), and bake thirty minutes ; then take from the 
oven, and let it stand in a cool place twenty minutes; 
then cover with a meringue. Set in the oven ten minutes, 
and serve with cold sauce. To make the meringue, beat 
the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and then beat into 
them gradually one cup of sugar. This pudding is quitf 
nice made with four eggs, but will not look so handsome 

Bread Pudding. 

Take a quart basinful of stale bread, and &oak in twr 
quarts of sweet milk two hours (keep in a cool place, 
while soaking) ; then mash well with a ppoon, and take 
out all the hard pieces. Beat light four eggs and stir into 
this, then add two teaspoonfuls of s.dt, a little nutmeg, 
and one fourth of a cup of sugar, if you serve it with 
sauce ; if not, one and a half cupfuls. Bake three quar- 
ters of an hour, and serve with lemon sauce. Some put 
raisins in, but it must be much stiffer if you have them, 
and the delicacy of the pudding is thereby lost. 

Whortleberry Pudding.

quart of berries Beat the sugar and butter to a cream 
and add the eggs well beaten ; then the sour milk, in 
which the saleratus is dissolved, and then the flour, 
and lastly the berries. Wring the pudding-cloth out 
of boiling water and spread it in a deep dish ; then 
turn the batter in and tie. Have ready a kettle of 
boiling water, and drop the pudding into it ; turn the 
pudding often, and boil three hours. Serve with vine- 
gar or wine sauce. This can be steamed also. Allow 
half an hour longer to cook, when steamed. 

Plain Whortleberry Pudding. 

One pint of flour, one egg, half a pint of sweet milk, 
one teaspoonful of cream tartar, half of saleratus, and a 
quart of berries. Beat the egg to a froth and mix with 
the milk ; then stir in the flour, in which the saleratus 
and cream tartar arc thoroughly mixed ; then the berries. 
Boil and serve as directed above. 

Boiled Apple Pudding. 

Pare, boil, and mash six good-sized mealy potatoes, and 
turn on them half a pint of boiling milk, then stir in a 
teaspoonful of salt and a tablcspoonfal of butter ; set in a 
cool place, and stir until about blood warm ; then stir in 
flour enough to roll, and roll about an inch thick Have 
a two-quart basinful of apples, which are pared, cored, 
and quartered ; spread these on the paste and grate a lit- 
tle nutmeg over them ; then roll up the paste, and boil as

directed for berry pudding, and serve with either maple 
sirup, wine, or vinegar sauce. This can be steamed, 
allowing four hours for it to cook. 

Boiled Batter Pudding. 

Take'^one cup of flour, and add to it gradually one 
quart of sweet milk ; then stir in one teaspoonful of 
Bait and six well-beaten eggs. Turn this into the pud- 
ding-cloth, and tic tight, leaving room for it to swell 
one third. Boil two hours. Serve with wine sauce. 
Great care must be taken in boiling puddings to have 
the water boiling when you put the pudding in, and to 
keep it boiling all the time. Steaming is the safer way, 
and I would always steam rather than boil, if I had the 
convenience. When boiling, always keep a kettle of 
boiling water to fill/'ttf^ as it boils away from the pud- 
ding For a puddii^g-doth get three quarters of a yard 
of drilling. Keep an old saucer to put in the bottom of 
the kettle, in which you boil the pudding, to prevent its 
being burned. When you arc ready to dish the pudding, 
have a pan of cold water, into which plunge it imme- 
diately upon taking it from the kettle (but do not let 
it stand in cold water one second) ; then put it in a 
deep dish, and untie the string; open the cloth and 
turn the pudding-dish on it ; then lift the pudding up 
by means of the cloth, and turn over. You will thus 
preserve the shape of the pudding. Batter puddings 
are very diflScult to make, and I would not advise a 
{^youDg cook to try them at first.

Baked Apple Pudding. 

Make a paste as directed for plain pie-crust, and line 
a dish with it, and fill the dish with sliced apples. To a 
dish holding three quarts, allow one cup of sugar, one 
half of molasses, one of water, one nutmeg, andTlialf a 
teaspoon of cinnamon ; cover this with the past^, and 
bake slowly three hours. Serve with sugar and cream, 
or with cold sauce. 

Pan Dowdy. 

Pare and slice tart apples enough to fill, about two 
inches deep, a flat earthen or tin pan. To three quarts 
of apple add one cup of sugar, one grated nutmeg, one 
cup of cold water, and butter the size of a walnut. 
Cover this with plain pie-crust (hi^ the crust about an 
inch thick), and bake slowly tw^ours and a half; 
then cover *and set where it will keep hoi one hour. 
Serve with sugar and cream. When don^ the apple 
will look red. Da not break the crust into the apple 
after baking, as by this means you spoil the pastry. If 
you wish to have it richer, cover with puff paste. 

Apple Dowdy. 

Pare and quarter about one dozen good tart apples, put 
them in a kettle with one cup of molasses, a small piece 
of butter, and one pint of hot water. Set this ou the fire, 
and let it come to a boil, and while it is heating make a

tar, one half of saleratus, and a little milk ; roll this 
large enough to fit into the kettle, and when the mix- 
ture begins to boil, put tlic paste in, cover tight, and 
boil gently twenty niiiiutcs. To be eaten without sauce. 
This is very nice when the apples are tart and it is made 
well • 

Apple Charlotte. 

Butter a brown earthen dish, and place around the sides 
slices of bread which have been cut about an inch thick, 
soaked in cold water, and buttered ; fill the dish with 
sliced apples, and grate over them one nutmeg ; strew on 
one cup of sugar, and then pour on one cup of water; 
this will carry the sugar through the apple. Cover the 
apple with slices of soaked and buttered bread, tlien 
cover the whole with a large plate, and bake in a very 
moderate oven four hours Kemove from the oven half 
an hour before time to dish, and sot where it will be 
cooling. When ready to dish, loosen gently round the 
edges i^ith a knife, lay the dish in which 3'ou intend 
serving it on the one in which it was baked, turn the 
dishes over, and lift the pudding-dish off. This is a very 
handsome dish. Serve with sugar and cream or plain. 

Apple and Sa{^o Pudding,

ding-dish, in which, after it has been well buttered, 
put as many pared and cored apples as will stand in the 
dish ; turn over them the sago, and bake one hour in a 
moderate oven. Serve with sugar and cream. 

Tapioca and Apple Pudding. 

Prepare the tapioca as directed for sago. Pare and 
quarter ten tart apples, and when the tapioca is cooked 
stir them into it, turn them into a buttered padding-dish, 
and bake one hour and a quarter. * Remove the pudding 
from the oven half an hour before it is served, or it will 
be thin. Serve with sugar and cream. ^ 

Boiled Tapioca Pudding. 

Wash one cup of tapioca, and soak it one hour in one 
pint of cold water, then stir in one quart of milk and two 
teaspoonfuls of salt ; set the basin into another of hot 
water, and set on the fire ; cook one hour and a half. 
Serve with sugar and cream. 

Baked Tapioca Pudding. 

Prepare the tapioca as before directed, allowing one 
pint more of milk for the same quantity of tapioca. 
Beat together one cup of sugar and four eggs ; stir this 
into the tapioca, and flavor wth lemon or nutmeg. Bake 
in a buttered disU half an hour. Serve without sauce, 
or omit the s^jgar and serve with wine sauce.

Oustard Pudding, 

Beat together three tablospoonfuls of sugar and four 
eggs ; stir this into one quart of milk, with one tea- 
spoonful of salt ; flavor with nutmeg or lemon. Bake 
until firm in the centre ; this you tell by inserting the 
handle of a teaspoon. Do not let the oven get hot 
enough to boil it. 

Baked Indian Pudding. 

Three tablespoonfuls of Indian meal, one cup of mo- 
lasses, two quarts of milk, two eggs, butter half the 
size of an egg, one tablespoonful of ginger, two teaspoon- 
fuls of salt ; boil one quart of the milk, and pour it 
boiling on the meal, then turn in the molasses, and 
next the cold milk, butter, ginger, salt, and eggs. 
Bake five hours in a moderate oven. Serve with cream. 
The eggs and ginger may be omitted if you choose. 

Cottage Pudding. '-^

The pudding is improved by sifting sup^ar over it, before 
baking. 

Sponge Pudding. 

Beat to a froth three eggs and one cup of sugar ; stir 
into this half a cup of cold water, and then two cups of 
flour in which arc mixed one teaspoonful of saleratus and 
two of cream of tartar. Flavor with lemon, and bake in 
two shallow dishes. When baked frost with frosting No.

Italian Fritters. 

Cut stale bread into slices an inch thick, and soak 
them in a custard made with two eggs and a pint of 
milk ; then fry a light brown in boiling lard (have as 
much lard in the pan as you would for doughnuts), and 
serve with either wine sauce No. 2 or cider sauce. Have 
the dishes very hot. 

I have liere given rules for twenty-three plain pud- 
dings, and if anything richer is desired, it will be found 
in Part Second.

PIES. 

Plain Pie Omst. 

Into one quart of flour rub a large spoohf i of Bait 
and half a cup of lard, and then wet with ice-water 
enough to make a soft paste ; roll this on th( board un- 
til it is about half an inch thick, then spread on half a 
cup of washed butter, dredge with flour, and fold into 
a email square. Pound lightly with the rollin„5-pin, then 
roll out again ; roll it up, and set un the ice lO harden ; 
it will be ready to use in two hours. In w'uter it can 
be used immediately. To make the bottom crust, rub 
three quarters of a cup of lard into one quart of flour 
and one 8|)oonful of salt, and wet with cold water, to 
make a soft paste. Do not roll, as it makes it tough 
Butter is more healthful than lard ; therefore, if you can 
afibrd it, use it. 

Oream Paste, 

To one quart of flour add one spoonful of salt, and 
mix to a soft paste with sweet cream", roll thin and 
spread with cream and dredge with flour, fold and roll 
again ; repeat this operation three times, then make the 
pies. Pies made with this paste taste nice, and are not

hurtful, but do not look so handsome as when made 
with butter and lard. Look in Part Second for minute 
direction for making paste. 

Sliced Apple Pies. 

Line the plates with bottom crust, and fill the plate 
with quartered apples. To a common-sized plate allow 
two spoonfuls of sugar, a little nutmeg, and two spoon- 
fuls of water. Cut the upper crust a little larger than 
the plate, and raise the under crust with the blade of 
the knife, and lay it under it. Bake in a moderate oven 
one hour. When molasses is preferred, use three spoon- 
fuls, and a little cinnamon instead of nutmeg. 

Stewed Apple Pies. 

Pare, core, and stew the apples with just water enough 
to prevent their burning. To a quart of stewed apple 
allow one cup of sugar. Bottom the plates and roll a 
piece of the top crust out (making it long enough to go 
around the plate), cut into strips an inch wide, and lay 
around the plate, then put in the apple (Do not make 
the pie too thick.) Grate over it a little nutmeg, cover, 
and bake in a rather quipk oven forty minutes. 

^ Dried Apple Pies. 

Cook the apple according to the directions given in 
Part Second, under Dried Apple, and make the same as 
stewed apple pie.

Berry Pies. 

Line the plates, and fill as full as you can with berries, 
and dredge on about half a spoonful of flour, and two 
spoonfuls of sugar, and two of water ; cover as directed 
for sliced apple pies, and bake forty minutes in a moder- 
ate oven. All berry pies are made in this manner, if 
Ihey are very sour using more sugar. Cherries and cur- 
rants do not require any water, but more sugar, and 
they must not be heaped in the plate as blueberries, 
blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries are. 

Rhubarb Pies. 

Cut the rhubarb in the morning, or if you buy it, al- 
ways keep in a cool place until ready to cook it. Strip 
off the skin and cut it into pieces about an inch long ; 
atew in just water enough to prevent its burning ; when 
cold, sweeten to taste. Cover the pie-plates, and roll the 
upper crust about half an inch thick ; cut into strips an 
inch wide, and after filling the plate with the rhubarb, 
put on four cross-pieces and the rim. Bake half an houi. 

Squash Pies. 

Pare, boil, and sift a good dry squash. To one quart 
of the squash pour on two of boiling mil^and then stir 
in two cups of sugar, two spoonfuls of salt, one of cinna- 
mon, one grated nutmeg, and five well-beaten eggs. Line

to boil a stick of cinnamon in the milk, instead of using 
the ground. 

Cranberry Pies. 

Stew the cranberries according to directions in Part 
Second, and make the same as rhubarb pies. 

Gooseberry Pies. 

Stew the gooseberries iu as little water as possible, 
sweeten to taste, and make the same as rhubarb pies. 



Pumpkin Pies.

sieve. Make the same as squash, adding a teaspoonful of 
ginger. They may be made without eggs by using five 
pounded crackers. Cook enough of the pumpkin at a 
time to last two weeks ; after you have kept it ope week, 
pt't in the oven and scald, then set away in a cool place.

• 



Boil a shank of beef six hours ; then take up and sei 
away to cool. (Save the liquor for soup.) When cold, 
free from bones and cut off all the fat and gristle ; then 
chop fine. To one quart of the chopped meat add three 
of chopped apple, one pint of chopped suet, one quart 
of chopped raisins, one quart of sugar, one of iflcjlasses, 
half a cup of cinnamon, one quarter of a cup of cloves, 
one quaiter of a cup of allspice, one quarter of a cup of 
ground mace, six grated nutmegs, half a cup of salt. 
Mix this llwroughly with the hands, then turn on the 
mixture three quarts of good cider, and let the mixture 
stand over night In the morning scald, in a porcelain 
kettle, one hour ; then put in stone pots ; cover tigjht 
and keep in a cool, dry place. This will keep three 
months. To tell the exact amount of spice and sweet- 
ening is almost impossible, as tastes vary ; but with a 
little judgment, and the rule I have given, I tliink there 
cannot be any very serious trouble. Prepare the paste and 
plat?s as for stewed apple pies, and put in the meat ; 
then grate a little nutmeg over it, and strew a few whole 
raisins in ; cover and bake one hour in a moderate oven. 

Mock Mince Pies. 

Two pounded crackers, one cup of ra(J^ses, one of 
cider, one of chopped raisins, two eggs, one teaspoonful 
of Bait, one of clove, two of cinnamon, one of mace, one 
uutmeg. Bake forty minutes. This quantity makes two 
pies.

Lemon Pies. 

Soak a pounded cracker in one pint of new milk ; stir 
in to this the yolks of three and the whites of two 
eggs, which have been beaten with half a cup of sugar 
and the rind and juice of one lemon Bake in a deep 
plate, which has been lined with plain paste, half an 
hour. When cooked, beat the white of one egg to a 
froth, and stir in one spoonful of sugar ; set in the oven 
until a light brown. 

Cream Pies. 

TJiree eggs beaten with one and a half cups of sugar, 
half a cup of cold water, two cups of flour in which 
are mixed one half teaspoonful of saleratus, one of 
cream of tartar. Flavor with lemon. Bake in deep 
tin plates such as you use fcr squash-pies, and when 
cool split with a sharp knife, and fill. This will make 
four pies. 



Filling for Oream Pies. 

One pint of new milk, one cup of sugar, half a cup 
of flour, two eggs Put the basin, in which the milk is, 
into another of hot water. Beat the sugar, flour, and 
eggs together^ptil they are light and smooth, and when 
the milk boils, stir in with one teaspoonful of salt. 
Cook twenty minutes, stirring often. Flavor with lemon. 
This will fill four pies.

Washington Pies. 

Make the outside the same as for cream pies, and

richer pies look in Part Second. 

Remarks. 

Always measure flour after it has been sifted, unless 
told to measure before. Always sift Indian and rye 
meal, and never sift Graham or oat meal. Always set 
milk into boiling water to boil, as it boils quicker in 
this way, and there will be no danger of burning. Save 
all the fat from soups, boiled and roast meats. The fat 
from beef, pork, and poultry, keep for shortening or 
frying; and from ham, mutton, and soups, in which 
vegetable were boiled, for the soap grease. To clarify 
drippings, boil them a few minutes, and then cut in a 
raw potato, and let it cook for five minutes, then drop 
in a pinch of saleratus, and strain. If all the drippings 
ar^i^aken care of, it will be a great saving in a family 
In many of the rules given here it has been very diflScult 
to say just how much spice to use, as there is such a 
difference in tastes, so that each one must use her own 
judgment; but be careful that one spice predominates. 
Always use twice as much cinnamon and nutmeg as you 
do clove. In making frosting pudding-'sauce, and all 
kinds of delicate cake, use the powdered sugar, if pos- 
sible. For rich cake, the coffee-crushed, powdered and 
sifted, is the best. For dark cake, the brown sugar will t>e 



1J6 



THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 



found the nicest. It makes it richer. Save all thi pieces 
of bread for dressing, puddings, and griddle cakes. Tin 
is not very good to mix cake iu, and earthen dishes 
are always being broken. The stone china wash bowls 
are very good for this purpose. You can often find odd 
ones at the crockery stores, and they will last a lifetime 
for this purpose. In baking and fryiug cook everything 
brown. Bread and pastry are more healthful over-done, 
than under done. 

One even quart of sifted flour is one pound, one pint 
of granulated sugar is one pound, two good-sized cupp 
of butter are one pound. Do not buy large quantities 
of Indian and rye meal at a time, as they sour quickly. 
Keep all kinds of meal, flour, and meats in a cool, dry 
place. Keep tea, coffee, and extracts from the air. 
Never set anything into the ice-chest while warm, as 
it will heat the chest and absorb an unpleasant flavor 
from the chest. This is true of the cellar also. Keep 
a note-book for tried receipts, and for any changes 
which you wish to make in the receipts which you^e 
constantly using. By thought and observation one can 
learn something new in regard to cooking every day, 
and at the time it will seem so important that you can- 
not forget it; but you will if you do not have it written. 

In the miscellaneous receipts will be found some very 
nice ones for the family table. They are receipts which 
I forgot, or did not receive until after the book was all 
written and classified. But they were too valuable to be 
left out, and I therefore put them in under this heading.

PART SECOND. 



SOUPS. 

Soup Stock. 

If you buy fresh meat for a soup stock, the shank ia 
the most economical. Ilave it cut into several pieces, 
and the bone cracked, at the butcher's. Wash and put 
on to boil in two gallons of cold water, and one spoon- 
ful of salt (the salt helps the scum to rise). When it 
comes to a boil, take off the scum and set the kettle 
where the soup will just simmer for ten hours. Then 
strafn into a nice tin, which is kept for this purpose, 
or a stone pot ; set where it will be cold, and in the 
morning skim off all the fat, then turn gently into the 
soup-kettle, being careful not to turn in the sediment. 
It is now ready to make any kind of soup. If you 
wish to have a jelly in the morning, boil it in six quarta 
of water. You can then, after taking off the fat, turn 
the f,elly over, and scrape off the sediment. Use the 
meat for hash. Another way to make soup stock, is to 

117 



118 



THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 



cover the bones of roast meats with cold water and treat 
in the same manner. This should always be done in 
boarding-houses and hotels ; but in private families (un- 
less very large), there is not meat enough consumed to 
do this. When making a stock, however, if there are 
any cold meat bones, they should be used. Professor 
Blot does not recommend boiling ; but I have been 
more successful in obtaining clear soup in this manner 
than when I did not let it boil. I would always boil 
my stock the day before it is to be used, as by this 
means only can fat be avoided, unless you buy all lean 
beef, which is very expensive. Do not boil vegetables 
with the stock, as they cause it to sour quickly. 



? 



Brown Soup. 



Crack the bone of a shank of beef; take out the mar 
row and lay in the bottom of the soup-kettle ; cut the 
meat from the bones and lay it in the kettle, set the ket- 
tle on the fire and brown the meal on all sides, being care- 
ful not to burn it. When well browned, put in the I0nes 
and two quarts of cold water, cover tight, and let it 
simmer one hour ; then put in a stick of cinnamon, eight 
whole cloves, a few pieces of mace, one onion, one car- 
roty half a turnip and six quarts of water. Boil this six 
hours very gently, strain ai.f' set away. In the morning 
skim off the fat and turn the soup into the kettle ; let it 
come to a boil ; season to taste with pepper • alt ; 
cut in thin slices one fresh lemou»nd put into tUt o i ^,

and then turn into the tureen. Send to table toasted 
bread, cut into small squares, in a separate dish. Some 
think that half a wine-glass of brandy ia an improvement. 

Brown Soup, No. 2. 

Lay the bones from a roast of beef and a roast of 
mutton in the soup-kettle. Cut up one onion, one small 
turnip, one carrot, one parsnip, and lay in the kettle ; 
then a blade of mace, a stick of cinnamon, ten whole 
cloves, a sprig of parsley, a sprig of sage, if you have 
them green, if not, a teaspoonful of each ; now dredge 
in a cup of flour, a tablespoonful of salt, half of pepper ; 
then pour on eight quarts of cold water, and boil five 
hours (skim carefully when it first boils); tlien strain 
through a sieve, and put back into the kettle with one 
cup of sago, and boil one hour and a half. Serve with 
toasted bread. Any kind of bones will make this, but 
beef is the best. 

Brown Soup, No. 3. 

Take two quarts of stock and boil with one onion, 
one carrot, one turnip, six whole cloves, one blade oi 
mace, one stick of cinnamon, for one hour ; then strain 
into the tureen, and serve with toasted bread. 

Vegetable Soup. 

Cut aito strips two inches long and one fourth of an 
inch wide, two carrots, two parsnips, one turnip, and

and boil one hour ; then strain them and put in the 
soup-kettle with three quarts of stock ; let this boil up 
once. Season with pepper and salt, and serve. 



Julienne Soup. 

This is made the same as vegetable soup, putting in 
every kind of a green vegetable. It is made in June, 
July, and the first of August. The stock should be 
very clear. (Omit beets.) 

Barley Soup. 

Wash half a cup of pearl barley, and boil it slowly 
in one quart of water three hours ; then turn iiito the 
soup kettle, with three quarts of stock ; let this boil 
up and season with pepper and salt. Serve.

SOUPS. 121 

Ox-Tail Soup. 

Separate at the joints two ox-tails, put them on to boil 
with one onion, one carrot (have them whole), a few 
cloves, a blade of mace, and a stick of cinnamon. Boil 
two hours ; then strain the liquor, into the soup-kettle, 
separate the tails from the vegetables, and spice, and 
put them into the kettle ; to this add two quarts of 
stock ; season with pepper and salt ; boil up once, and 
serve. 

Tomato Soup. 

Peel and slice tomatoes enough to fill a two-quart ba- 
sin ; put them into the soup-kettle with six quarts of 
water and two pounds of beef; boil three hours ; sea- 
son with pepper, salt, and a spoonful of butter. Strain, 
and serve with toasted bread.

nip, a' few cloves, a blade of mace, a stick of cinnamon, 
and two heaping spoonfuls of flour, lor two hours ; then 
strain into the soup kettle. Add to this two quarts of 
stock, and let it boil. Braid up the livers, chop the 
hearts and gizzards, and put them in the soup. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper, and serve. 

Turkey Soup. 
Save the liquor in which the turkey was cooked ; the

following morning skim of all the fat ; cut all the meat 
from the part of the turkey which has been left from 
the dinner of the day previous. Put the bones and liquor 
on to boil with one onion, two parsnips, one small tur- 
nip. Boil three hours ; then strain, and put back with 
half a cup of tapioca, and some pieces of the cold tur- 
key. Season with pepper and salt. Boil two hours 
longer, stirring often to prevent the tapioca from burning. 

Chicken Soup. 

Set the liquor, in which two or three fowls have been 
boiled, away to cool. Skim ofi' the fat, and then put it 
into the soup-kettle with one whole onion and half a 
cup of rice ; boil two hours. Just before dishing take 
out the onion, and put in some pieces of cold chicken. 

White Soup. 

Take any part of veal (the shin is the best), and al- 
low one quart of cold water to one pound of veal, and 
to eight pounds allow one onion, three parsnips, one

obtain it. 



Mock Ttirtle Soup. ^ 

Take the brains from a calf's head, and put them in 
". bowl of cold water ; wash the head, and let it stand 
in a pan of cold water two hours ; then put it in the soup- 
kettle with eight quarts of cold water and a shin of 
veal ; let this boil three hours, and then set away to 
cool over night. In the morning cut up the veal and 
put into the soup-kettle, with a stalk of celery, one 
onion, one carrot, one turnip, two parsnips, three blades 
of mace, one stick of cinnamon, ten cloves, salt, pep- 
per, and two heads of parsley. Cover this with three 
pints of cold water, and boil two hours. Strain this, 
and wash the soup-kettle, then turn the soup back. 
Now skim the fat from stock, and put that into the ket- 
tle also. Put into the frying-pan two spoonfuls of but- 
ter, and when it boils up stir in four of dry flour, stir 
until a dark-brown (but not burned), and when the soup 
boils up stir this in. Now braid half of the brains 
(which you tied in a muslin cloth, and boiled with the 
head), and stir them in. Stir in also a spoonful of 
walnut catsup, one of mushroom catsup, and one of to 
mato catsup Boil two hours, and then put in the fact

cut in very small strips, one glass of port wine, and 
one lemon cut into thin slices, and let it boil up once, 
and dish. When in the tureen, put in the egg balls. 
To make the egg balls^ boil four eggs ten minutes, drop 
them in cold water, and take out the yolks and pound 
them in the mortar until they are reduced to a paste, 
then beat them with one teaspoonful of salt, a little 
pepper, and the white of one egg. Make them into 
round balls the size of a walnut, roll them in flour, and 
fry them brown in butter, being careful not to burn 
them. They are now ready for the soup. 

Oyster Soup. 

Wash one quart of oysters, if they are solid, in one 
quart of cold water ; if not, one pint of water ; drain 
the water through a cullender into the soup-kettle ; set 
the kettle on the fire, and when the liquor comes to a 
boil, skim it; then add one quart of rich new milk; 
just before it comes to a boil, turn in the oysters, and 
thicken with two spoonfuls of corn starch wet with milk ; 
then stir in half a cup of butter, and season with pep- 
per and salt. Let this boil up once, and serve immedi- 
ately. Be very carelul that they do not burn. A safe 
way is to boil the milk in a basin, which is set into 
another of water, and then turn it on the oysters just 
before removing it from the fire. 



FISH. 

Baked Ood and Salmou. 

Take a fish weighing eight or nine pounds, wash and 
dry it ; then lay in the pan, and skewer to keep the 
head and tail together. Stuff the belly and eyes with 
a stuffing made of chopped pork, pounded biscuit, sweet 
herbs, pepper, salt, onions, and butter. Sew up the 
belly and bake two hours. Flour well and baste often. 
Make the gravy in the following manner : Stir into 
one pint of boiling water two spoonfuls of flour wet 
with cold water, one spoonful catsup, a pint h of ground 
mace, half a teaspoon of ground parsley, and a glass 
of red wine ; salt and pepper Let this boil, and when 
the fish is dished, stir the gravy that is i;i tlie pan into 
the made gravy. Add the wine the last thing. Gar- 
nish the fish with sliced lemon and the yolks of hard 
boiled eggs. 

Scalloped Fish. 

Skin and cut into small pieces a cod or haddock, and 
lay in a deep earthen dish. Dredge in about half a 
cup of tlour, one spoonful of salt, one teaspoon I ul of 
pepper. Cut about two spoonfuls of butter into small 
pieces and strew in ; cover the whole with new milk, 
and bake forty minutes.

POULTRY. 

To Clean Poultry. 

First singe over blazing paper or alcohol ; then cut 
off the feet and tips of the wingS; and the neck as far 
as it looks dark ; then, with the blade of a knife, take 
out all the pin-feathers ; now turn the skin of the neck 
back, and with the fore-finger and thumb draw out the 
crop and windpipe ; cut a slit in the lower part of the 
fowl, and draw out the intestines, being careful not to 
break the gall-bag, as it will spoil the flavor of the meat. 
It will be found near the upper part of the breast-bone 
and attached to the liver. Now wasli thoroughly in sev- 
eral waters, and drain. If the poultry is at all strong, let 
it stand in water several hours, with either charcoal or 
saleratus. Split the gizzard, and take out the inside and 
inner lining ; wash and put on to boil in two quarts of 
cold water (this is for the gravy). 

Boast Turkey. 

Prepare as directed ; make a dressing with six pounded 

crackers, one teaspoonful of pepper, one tablespoonful of 

t^alt, one of sage, one of summer-savory, one of parsley, 

two eggs, butter the size of an egg, and cold water to 

126 



POULTRY. 127 

moisten ; stuff the turkey with this ; stuff the breast fir&^t, 
and the remainder put in the body. Now cross and tie the 
legs down tight ; run a skewer through the wings, fasten- 
ing them to the bod}' ; fasten the neck under the body 
with a skewer, and tie all with a twine. Rub the turkey 
with salt, and spit it ; baste often with the drippings and 
flour, and occasionally with butter. About fifteen min- 
utes before dishing baste with butter, and dredge on a 
little flour ; this will give it a frothy appearance. For 
eight pounds, allow one hour and three quarters, if 
roasted in the tin-kitchen ; if in the oven, one hour and 
half, and fifteen minutes for every pound more or less. 
Serve with giblet gravy and cranberry sauce. 

To make the gravy : Boil the heart, gizzard, liver, and 
neck in two quarts of water two hours ; then take them 
up and chop the gizzard and heart ; braid the liver and 
put them back again ; thickf^n with one spoonful of flour 
wet with cold water; season with salt and pepper. Let 
this simmer one hour longer, and when you dish the 
turkey turn the drippings into this gravy ; boil up once, 
and send to the table. Make all the gravy for poultry 
in this manner, omitting the chopped gizzards in chicken 
gravy. 

Roast Chicken. 

Prepare, stuff and truss the same as turkey. A pair of 
chickens, weighing each two and a half pounds, will 
require an hour and a quarter to roast if in the tin- 
kitchen ; one hour if in the oven. 



128 



THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 



Boast Goose. 

Prepare, as directed for poultry, and stuff the b )dy 
with a dressing made in the following manner : Pare and 
boil potatoes ; mash them and mix with one fourth of an 
onion chopped fine, one spoonful of sage, one of salt, one 
teaspoonful of pepper, a small piece of butter. Truss, 
and roast (if it weighs ten pounds) one hour and three 
quarters if in the tin kitchen, but if in the oven one 
hour and a half. Make the gravy as for turkey, and 
serve with apple-sauce. 

Skim off all the fat before putting the drippings in 
the gravy. 

Koast Duck. 

Prepare the dressing as for goose, and roast before a 
hot fire forty minutes, or if in the oven have it very hot 
and roast thirty minutes. Serve with either apple-sauce 
or currant jelly. Make gravy the same as for turkey. 

This time cooks the goose and ducks rare. 

Boast Partridges. 



Clean and truss ; then lard and roast thirty minutes. 
Serve with currant jelly To make the gravy : Put one 
spoonful of butter into a basin, and when it boils up stir 
in one spoonful of dry flour ; stir until a dark brown ; 
then pour on half a pint of boiling water. Season with 
salt, pepper, the partridge drippings, and a spoonful of 



POULTRY. 129 

currant jelly. Or serve with bread sauce, the rule foi 
which you will find under sauces. 

To lard a bird : Cut fat salt pork into thin, narrow 
slices, and put one end of the slice through the eye of a 
larding needle. (You can obtain one at any kitchen 
furnishing store.) Now run the needle under the skin 
of the bird, and draw the pork half way through, hav- 
ing the pieces about an inch apart. 

Roast Grouse. 

If you st^iff them, make the dressing the same as for 
turkey ; but they are not often stuffed. Roast thirty 
minutes, and serve with currant jelly. The gravy made 
the same as before directed 

Koast Pigeons. 

Lard and roast the same as partridges. Make the 
gravy the same, with the addition of one teaspoonful of 
clove and half a wineglass of claret. The pigeons must 
be young, or they will not be nice roasted. 

Small Birds. 

Woodcock, quail snipe, and plover may be cooked 
in the same manner as partridges, allowing fifteen min- 
utes to roast, and serve on toast. 



VENISON 



Eoast Venison. 

Ir in winter keep the venison three weeks after being 
killed ; but if in summer, ten or twelve days will be 
sufficient. Draw the dry skin from a leg of venison, and 
cut off the shank ; roast half an hour, and then baste 
with salt, water, butter, and flour ; when it has roasted 
one hour and a half, baste with claret wine. If it is to 
be served on blazers, two hours will ccok a leg weigh- 
ing fifteen pounds, but if not, roast four hours. A sad- 
dle of venison is cooked in the same way, but will re- 
quire only half as much time to roast To make the 
gravy, put the shank in a basin with three quarts of 
cold water, a few cloves, one onion, half a pound of 
beef, salt, and pepper ; boil until there is about a quart 
of liquor, then strain, and thicken with two spoonfuls of 
flour. When the venison is dished add the drippings 
and one glass of claret wine. Boil up once and serve. 
Have the dishes on which the venison is sei-ved and the 
plates very hot. 

Venison steak and pie is cooked the same as beef.

PIES. 

Puff Paste. 

Two cups of butter, one quart of flour, one tablespoon- 
ful of salt, one of powdered sugar. Wash the butter in 
cold water until it is light and waxy ; divide into two 
parts and set in the ice chest one hour. Mix the sugar 
and salt with the dry flour, and then wet with ice-water

with the rolling-pin, about half an inch thick ; now cut 
one of the cakes of washed butter into thin slices, and 
6-pread on the paste ; dredge with flour and fold up ; then 
pound lightly with the pin, and then roll out as before, 
and spread the second cake of butter the same as the 
first ; dredge and fold again ; now roll thin as before, 
and then roll up and place on a plate, and set in the ice 
chest one or two hours. When ready to cover the pie, 
cut just enough from the end of the roll to cover the pie ; 
sprinkle the board with a little flour, place the paste upon 
it, and fiour the rolling-pin with the hand ; now roW from 
you, and towards your left hand ; roll very lightly until 
the right size ; then cover and bake immediately. Quick- 
ne9if w>.d elasticity are very important, also the washing

of the butter, Ubc as little flour as possible in rolling the 
paste ; always make it in a cool room. It is a mistake 
to think the paste must be hard to be good ; always have 
it soft enough to roll easily. 

Green Apple Pies. 

Pare, qmarter, core, and stew nice tart apples in water 
enough to prevent them from burning. When tender, 
sweeten very sweet with white sugar, fill the pie-plate,

porcelain kettle with two quarts of water and two of 
cider; let this stand over night, and in the morning 
place on the fire and simmer three hours; then lay in 
(bat do not stir) two quarts of sugar, and simmer two 
hours longer ; then turn into a stone pot, and put 
away for use. Make the pies the same as green apple. 



Peach Pies. 

Lino the plate with plain paste, and lay in the plate 
five peaches, which just press between the fingers, but 
do not take out the stones, as they flavor the pie ; now 
fill the plate with peaches which have been cut in two 
and the stones taken out. Sift over this a small cup of

sugar, and then add two spoonfuls of water. Cover and 
bake in a moderate oven one hour. Do not peel tho 
peaches ; they are very much better not to be. 

Plnm Pies. 
Made the same as peach. 

Mince Pies.

very fine ; take one cupful of chopped suet, two pint 
bowlfuls of chopped apple, one of stoned raisins, half a 
bowlful of currants, half a pound of citron, one bowlful 
of sugar, one half of molasses, two tablespoonfuls of

four grated nutmegs, three tablespoonfuls of salt. Mi> 
all this thoroughly with the hands, and then add one 
quart of cider Put the mixture in a large earthen pan, 
and place over a kettle of boiling water and scald ; if 
there is not sugar and spice enough, season to taste. 
When scalded, stir in one pint of wine and half a pint of 
brandy. Do not let any one kind of spice predomir'ate. 
If not moist enough, use more cider. Prepare the plates 
as for apple pies, and spread in a cupful of the mince 
meat and cover with a rich pufi" paste. Bake one hour.

cup of sugar, the rind and juice of one lemon, and the 
yolks of two eggs ; then beat the whites of two eggs to 
a stiff froth, and stir in with one spoonful of milk ; turn 
this into the plate which you have prepared, and bake 
in a moderate oven forty-five minutes. Or you may line 
a deep plate with plain paste, as for squash pies, and 
turn the mixture into it, and bake forty minutes. This 
is very nice if the directions are exactly followed . 

Lemon Pies, No. 2 

The juice of two and the rind of three lemons, one cup 
of butter, one and a half of sugar, eight eggs. Beat the 
sugar, butter, lemons, and the yolks of the eggs together ; 
then add the whites beaten to a stiff froth. Bake in deep 
plates, line with plain paste, fifty minutes in a moderate 
oven. 

Marlborough Pies.

run them through the cullender ; stir in, while they arc 
hot, one spoonful of butter ; when cool, stir in the yolks 
of three eggs, the rind and juice of one lemon, and one 
teacup of sugar, which have been beaten together. Bake 
in a moderate oven forty minutes, in a deep plate, as 
squash pies. Cut and bake little cakes of puff paste, and 
when the pie is cold, garnish it with them.

Eich Wine Sauce. 

Beat to a cream half a cup of butter, and very grad- 
ually beat in one cup of sugar, one spoonful of corn 
starch, one wineglass of wine, and the white of one

of a cup of boiling water ; set this in warm water for 
two minutes, stirring all the while, and then serve. 

Plain "Wine Sauce. 

Put into a sauce-pan one cup of sugar and one cup 
of water ; grate into this half a nutmeg, and put on the

one glass of wine ; simmer ten minutes longer, and serve. 

Lemon Sauce. 

Beat to a froth one spoonful of butter, one cup of

spoonful of flour, one of vinegar, and a little nutmeg. 
Mix the flour with a little cold water, and stir into

DISHES FOR THE SICK. 

Beef Tea. 

Cut half a pound of lean beef into vety small pieces ; 
do not have a grain of fat on it, and put into a bottle 
that has a large opening (an olive or horseradish bottle 
will be nice) ; put in half a cup of cold water, and cork 
tight ; set this in a basin of cold water, and place on 
the fire where it will come to a boiling point, but not 
boil ; keep it at this temperature for two hours, then 
strain, and season with salt. 

Ohicken Broth. 

Put the bones and about one pound of the lean meat 
of chicken into a sauce-pan with three pints of water. 
When it comes to a boil, skim well. Simmer three 
hours, and strain and salt. If the patient can bear it, 
a little rice or tapioca boiled with it is an improvement. 

Oatmeal Grnel. 

Into one quart of boiling water, sprinkle two table- 
spoonfuls of oatmeal ; let this boil forty minutes ; season

with salt, strain and serve. If sugar, milk, or cream is 
wished, it may be added. 

Indian Meal Gruel. 

One quart of boiling water ; stir into this one spoon- 
ful of flour and two of Indian meal, mixed with a little 
cold water Boil thirty minutes. Season with salt, and 
strain. Use sugar and cream if you choose. If flour is 
not liked, use another spoonful of meal instead. 

Plum Porridge. 

Into one quart of boiling milk stir two spoonfuls of 
flour mixed with cold milk ; put in a handful of raisins 
and a little grated nutmeg. Boil twenty minutes. Sea- 
son with salt and strain. 

Oom Tea. 

Brown and pound in a mortar, one cup of sweet dry 
corn ; pour on this two cups of boiling water, and steep 
fifteen minutes. This is very light and nutritious, and 
can be taken where the patient is very weak. 

Oream Toast. 

Heat half a cup of cream, and season with salt. 
Toast two slices of bread a light brown, and pour the 
cream over it. Serve immediately. 



DISHES FOR THE SICK. 159

Btir in half a wineglass of sherry wine. Boil a moment 
and strain. 

Vinegar Whey, 

Boil one cup of milk, and stir in one spoonful of vin 
egar; if this does not make it whey, stir in a littl? 
more; when it curdles, strain. 

Sour Milk Whey.

sour milk, and strain. 

A Good Drink for the Lungs. 

Wash clean a few pieces of Irish moss ; put it in a 
pitcher, and pour over it two cups of boiling water. 
Set where it will keep at the boiling point, but not 
boil for two hours. Strain, and squeeze into it the 
juice of one lemon. Sweeten to taste. If the patient 
cannot take lemon, flavor with wine, vanilla, or nutmeg. 

Another Drink. 

Beat lightly one egg and one spoonful of sugar. Stir 
into this one cup of new milk, half a wineglass of wine, 
and a little nutmeg. This is nice without the wine.

dice. Put into a sauce-pan, with a teaspoonful of salt, 
one of flour, and one fourth of pepper. Pour on this a 
large pint of cold water. Let it stand an hour or two, 
then put on the fire ; bring slowly to a boil, and boil 
slowly an hour. If it has boiled away too much, add a 
little hot water ; but this rather hurts it. Skim off care- 
fully every particle of fat. This tea is more palatable 
than the other, and can be taken by those not extremely 
sick. 

Sack Posset, 

^ound one Boston cracker, or one soda biscuit. Fnt 
it in a pint of cold milk ; set on the fire, and simmer 
fifteen minutes. Beat together one egg, one wineglass

Charlotte Russe. 

Cut Btak sponge cake into slices about half an inch 
tliick, and line three moulds with it, having a space of 
half an inch between each slice ; set the moulds where 
they will not be disturbed until the filling is ready. N:.w 
take a deep tin pan and fill about one third full of either 
snow or pounded ice, and into this set another pan that 
will hold at least four quarts. Into a deep bowl nr pail, 
put one pint and a half of cream (if the cream is thick 
take t)nc pint of cream and half a pint oimilk), whip the 
cream to a froth, and when the bowl is full, skim the froth 
into the pan which is setting on the ice ; keep on doing 
this until the cream is all froth; now with the spoon draw 
the froth to one side, and you shall find that there is some 
of the cream which has gone back to milk ; turn this into 
the bowl again, and whip as before ; when the cream is all 
whipped, stir into it two thirds of a cup of powdered 
sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla, and half a box of gela- 
tine, which has been soaked in cold water, enough to 
cover it, one hour, and then dissolved in boiling water 
enough to dissolve it, which will be nearly half a cupful ; 
stir all this from the bottom of the pan until it begins to 
grow stiff; then fill the moulds, and set them on the ice 
in the pan for one hour, or until they are sent to the table.

When ready to dish them, just loosen them at the sides, 
and turn out on a flat dish. Have the cream ice cold 
when 3'ou begin to whip it ; it is a good plan to put a 
lump of ice into the cream while you are whipping it. 

The directions being so long, may make it appear to be 
a long and hard process; but it is not so, for it is easily 
and quickly made. The whip-churn you can get made

Directions for Freezing. 

Set the freezer in the centre of the tub ; be sure that 
everything is in place, or it will not work when you 
get it packed. Have the ice chopped fine, and put in 
a layer about three inches deep, then a layer of 
coarse salt about an inch deep, and then the ice, and 
BO on, -tiniil the tub is full, having the ice last. Use 
about one third salt, and two thirds ice. It must be 
packed very solid After the cream has been put in, 
and you have turned it ten minutes, pack again, and 
be sure to get it solid. When the water is trouble- 
some, let off some, but not all. Stop the hole imme- 
diately, and pack to fill the space that was occupied 
by the water, as the mixture will not freeze until all 
ail- is excluded Beat one way until. you can no longer 
turn the beater. Now carefully brush the ice and salt 
from the cover and take out the beater ; cover again 
and put a cork in the cover. Now pack again with ice 
and salt. Cover the whole with a piece of old carpet, 
and let it stand a few hours. Or if you wish to put it in 
moulds, fill them as soon as you take ou^ the beater ; 
pack th( m down welh or they will not look smooth 
when taken out. If you use an old-fashioned freezes*, 
you must have a long iron spoon to beat it with, 
and a long knife to cut it from the sides with. 
Turn the freezer with the hands ; take off the cover 
every fifteen minutes. Scrape the cream from the sides, 
and then beat, as you would cake, lor ten minutes. 



DESSERTS. 173 

When hard, light, and smooth, cover as before directed, 
or put in moulds Lay the moulds in ice and salt for 
three hours, and when ready to dish, dip them in warm 
water for an instant. Wipe and turn the mould on an 
ice rream dish ; remove very gently. Serve immedi- 
ately 

Ice Oream made with Cream. 

Take four quarts of cream and ffweeten with one 
heaping quart of sugar. Flavor with anything you 
please, but very strung. 

Coffee Ice Oream. 

Made the same as chocolate, but using coffee in- 
stead of chocolate. Tie one pint of ground coffee in a 
piece of muslin, and boil in the milk half an hour be- 
fore ; then take it out, and make as before directed. 

Lemon Ice Oream. 

Put two quarts of rich milk into a tin pail, and set 
into a kettle with hot water ; when this comes to a boil, 
stir in four spoonfuls of corn starch ; wet with one cup 
of milk. Cook this twenty minutes, and then add' the 
yolks of twelve eggs, well bf^aton, stir a few minutes, 
and then take of and cool ; before cooling, stir in one 
heaping quart uf sugar. When ice cold, add two quarts 
of cream, or rich milk will answer, and freeze 

Vanilla, pineuppl<G, and all other kinds of cream may 
be made in the same way, but use eight whites and yolks 



174 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

instead of twelve yolks of eggs For strawberry and rasp- 
berry cream, allow the juice of one quart of berries to one 
gallon of cream. Some persons object to corn starch, 
but it makes a very much smoother and handsomer 
cieam than when it is all made of eggs. Where all 
eggs are used, make the same as soft custard, and allow 
one quart of cream or milk to one quart of custard. 

Chocolate Ice Cream. 

Made the same as the others, with the addition of 
one cake of chocolate, and one pint more of sugar 
Prepare the chocolate as for chocolate custard. 

Lemon Sherbet. 

One gallon of ice water, the juice of twenty lemons, 
and three pints of sugar ; strain into the freezer, and 
freeze as you would cream. 

Currant, strawberry, raspberry, and orange sherbets 
may be made in the same manner. 

N. B. To flavor ice creams, use the extract. Lubin's 
is the best. 

Eoman Punch. 

Two quarts of cold water, one of Madeira wine, half a 
pint of brandy, the juice of six lemons, and two quarts 
of sugar. This is very hard to freeze. In winter use 
8D0W instead of ice. 



CAKE. 

Kemarks. 

While making pies and cakes, the first thing to be 
done 18 to build your fire and get your oven just right. 
Now siil your flour, and measure it ; count and break 
your eggs ; measure every thing you are going to put 
in the cake ; lard your pans and line them with paper. 
Here is a formula, which it will be well to follow in 
making all kinds of cake in which you put butter. 

Beat the butter to a cream, and then add the sugar 
gradually ; then spice and any kind of liquor which yon 
use, then the milk, then the eggs well beaten, then the 
flour, in which always mix thoroughly, while dry, the sal- 
eratus and cream of tartar, and if fruit, let that always be 
the last thing to be added 

One, Two, Three, Four Cake, 

One coffee-cup of butter, two of sugar, four of flour, 
one of milk, five eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, 
two of cream of tartar, lemon. This will make two

half spice with one teaspoonful of cinnamon, one half 
of clove, the same of allspice and nutmeg. Bake in a 
rather quick oven.

PRESERVES. 

In making preserves, iiso a porcelain kettle which 
should be used for nothing else. Have also a large 
wooden spoon, which keep expressly for this use. Be 
very careful not to let the sirup barn or boil over, and 
always skim carefully. Look at your preserves once a 
month at least, and if they are beginning to ferment, 
scald and skim If they mould on top that will not in- 
jure thorn, but will keep the air from them and thus pro- 
tect thorn Be very careful when removing it not to get 
any of it in the sirup. Preserves should be kept in a 
cool, dry place. Always soal them while hot, as by this 
means you do not seal air in ; but if they are allowed 
to grow cold before sealing they will not keep so well. 
Heat the jars before putting the preserves in, by set- 
ting them in a pan of warm water, and let it heat grad- 
ually until it comes to a boiling point. Cut note-paper 
in round pieces about two inches deeper than the mouth 
of the jar ; make a paste with the white of an egg and 
a little flour ; wet the edges with it and paste on. 

Preserved Peaches. 

Pare and cut in two peaches that have begun to mellow, 
but they must be ripe. Take out the stones and then put 

187 



188 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

the fruit in a large earthen dish, cover with coffee 
crushed sugar. For every pound of fruit allow one 
pound of sugar Let this stand over night, and in the 
morning turn the sirup into the preserving kettle, and 
clarify ; then put in the peaches and cook until tender, 
which will be in about thirty minutes. Lay them in a 
Btone pot, and pour the boiling sirup over them. 
When cool, put in small jars, and paste note-paper over 
the top. Keep in a cool, dry place. 

Preserved Pears, 

Pare, but do not cut them up. Weigh them, and 
then boil until tender in just water enough to cover 
them. When tender, take them out and make a sirup 
of the water in which they jvere boiled, and the sugar; 
allow one pint of water and one pound of sugar to 
every pound of fruit. Boil this one hour, and then put 
in the pears and one sliced lemon to every pound ; boil 
gently for forty minutes, then take up, and when cool 
put in jars Boil the sirup until thick, and if the jars 
are stone, pour over the pears while hot. 

Grab Apple Preserves. 

Wash the apples and drain ; leave the stems on them. 
Make a sirup with the same weight of sugar that you 
have apples, and half a pint of water to a pound of 
sugar ; simmer the apples in this forty-five minutes, and 
then take out and lay in a stone jar. Let the sirup 
simmer one hour longer, and turn boiling on the apples. 
Seal while hot, with note-pape^ 



l>RESfiRVES. 189 

Preserved Pineapple. 

Pare and cut the pineapple in slices about an inch thick. 
Cover with an equal weight of sugar, and let it stand over 
night. In the morning proceed as with peach preserves. 

Preserved Oitron Melon. 

• 

Fare and cut the melon into handsome pieces about an 
inch thick. Boil gently until tender, in just water 
enough to cover it ; as soon as it is tender, take out and 
lay in a platter, and put more on to boil. Do this until 
all is cooked. Now make a sirup of the weight of the 
melon in sugar (which weigh before cooking) ancj the 
water in which it was boiled Let this boil one hour ; 
then put in the melon, and one lemon sliced to each 
pound of melon ; a few cloves. Simmer fifty minutes, 
then take up and boil the sirup half an hour longer, 
then pour over the melon while hot. 

Preserved Apples. 

Pare and quarter good tart apples ; preserve them the 
same as melon, omitting the cloves. They are nice to 
use late in the spring and early in the summer for 
green apple pies ; but as a preserve, they are too insipid. 

Preserved Plums. 

Take the weight of the plums m sugar, and to two 
pounds of sugar allow half a pint of water. Make a 



100 



THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 



eiiup of lliis, and when clear, boil the plums in it for 
forty-five minutes. Do not put many in it at a time. 
When they are all done, let the sirup boil an hour, and 
pour over them while hot. Seal with note-paper This 
rule will answer for all kinds of plums. 

Preserved Cherries. 
CherrieB are preserved the same as plums. 

Preserved Quinces. 

Pare, quarter, and cut out the cores. Save the par- 
ings and cores for jelly. Preserve the same as pears, 
omitting the lemon. 

Easpberry Jam. 

Take equal weights of raspberries and sugar ; put the 
berries in a dish and cover with the sugar, and let them 
stand over night. In the morning put in the kettle and 
boil two hours (skimming carefully), and put up in jars ; 
seal with note paper. Strawberries and blackberries are 
cooked in the same manner. 

Barberries Preserved with Pears. 

Weigh the barberries, and make a sirup of an equal 
weight of sugar, allowing half a pint of water to a pound 
of sugar. When the sirup is clear, put in the barberries 
(which must be free from stents), and boil fifty minutes 



PRESERVES. 101 

When the barberries are all cooked, put as many pears, 
pared and quartered, as you have barberries into the sirup, 
and boil until tender ; then take up and put with the 
barberries. Boil the sirup thirty minutes, and then pour 
boiling over the fruit. 

Barberries Preserved in Molasses. 

One peck of barberries, six quarts of molasses. Pick 
the barberries free from stems and imperfect ones. Let 
the molass eajco me to a boil, then put in the barberries, 
and boil abou%ifty minutes. They will be clear and full 
when done.i* Skim them out and put in the jars. Save 
two quarts of the sirup for drinks, and turn the remainder 
over the barberries. Be very careful that the molasses 
shall not burn. Sweet apples may be cooked with these 
in the same manner that pears are cooked with thoSe done 
in sugar. 

Grape Marmalade. 

Put the grapes in a stone pot, and set the pot into a 
kettle with cold water •, set this on the fire and boil until 
the grapes will mash easily ; stir them often, and jam 
with bowl of the spoon. Take them up and strain 
through a sieve. To a quart of the pulp allow a pint of

Currant Jelly. 

To be nice the currants must he just ripe, and neither 
more nor less. Put them, stems and all, into a stone pot

and cover to keep the steam in. Set the pot into a kettle 
with cold water, and place on the fire. Boil until they 
will all jam easily. Jam them with the bowl of the spoon. 
Lay a piece of thin muslin in a sieve, and turn the cur- 
rants into it ; squeeze the juice through. If you are care- 
ful to have it clear now, you will not have to strain it 
after the sugar is added. Tu a pint of juice add a pint 
of sugar, and boil fifty minutes. Take it off the lire and 
let it stand until so cool that it will not break the glasses, 
but no longer, and then till the glasses ; let them stand in 
the sun a few days, and them seal with nq^^lper. 

Ourrant Shrub. 



Make the same as jelly but boil only ten minutes 
When cool, bottle. Raspberry, strawberry, and black- 
berry shrubs made in the same way. 

Apple Jelly. 

Make the same as quince, with the addition of a stick 
of cinnamon and one lemon to a quart of juice, after the 
sugar is added. It will take longer to cook than quince. 

Quince Jelly. 

Put the cores and parings in the preserving kettle, 
and cover with cold water. Boil gently two hours ; 
then squeeze through a thick piece of cloth, and to a 
pmt of juice allow a pint of sugar. Boil until it will

jelly when a little is put in a saucer, then treat as 
currant jelly. Where water is put with fruit you can- 
not limit the time of boiling. 

To Oan Berries. 

Put the berries in a nice tin pan, and set over a boiler 
of boiling water, and to a gallon of berries allow one 
cup of boiling water ; heat the berries to a boiling 
point. (Cover them, and stir occasionally, and they 
will heat much sooner.) Heat self-sealing jars by putting 
them in a pan of cold water. Set on the stove, and 
let the water boil ; now fill the jars to the top, and put 
on the covers, and set up ; as the glass is expanded 
by the heat, they cannot be set tight now ; but after 
th^y become cool, get a man to set them up very tight. 
Set away in !i cool, dry place. Always use the fruit as 
soon as opened. If these directions are followed, you 
may put up any kind of fruit, and keep it nice for years. 



PICKLES. 

Pickled Cucumbers. 

Pick the cucumbers before they get very large ; lay 
them in a tub, and cover with a boiling brine of one 
gill of salt to one gallon of water ; let this stand until 
cold, and then turn the brine back into the kettle 
and boil again, and pour over the cucumbers; do this 
five times, and then turn off and cover with boiling 
alum water fallow one heaping spoonful of alum to one 
gallon of water). When cold, turn off, and boil again, 
and turn on the cucumbers a second time. When this 
is cold tnrn off, and drain the cucumbers Now put on 
a few quarts of good cider vinegar in a porcelain ket- 
tle, and when it boils, drop a few cucumbers in at a 
time, and let them boil about eight minutes; then skim 
out and drain. Do this until they are all scalded. Lay 
them in a stone pot and cover with good cider vinegar. 
You may use bell peppers and spice if you choose. 
You cannot fail to have good pickles if you follow this 
rule. 

Tomato Pickles. 

Cut green tomatoes into slices about an inch thick, 

and sprinkle with salt. ( Allow half a cup of salt to a 

peck of tomatoes), and let them stand over night. In 

the morning turn off all the liquor and scald them in

sprinkle between them half a spoonful of white mustard 
seed and a handful of whole cloves. Cover vnth cold 
vinegar. 

Tomato Pickles, No. 2.

Pick and wash the cranberries, and put in the preserv- 
ing kettle with half a pint of water to one quart of ber- 
ries ; now put the sugar on top of the berries, allowing 
a pint of sugar to a quart of berries. Set on the fire and 
stew about half an hour Stir often to prevent burning 
They will not need straining, and will preserve their rich 
color cooked in this way. Never cook cranberries be- 
fore putting in the sugar. Less sugar may be used if 
you do not wish them very rich. 



198 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Apple Sauce. 

Pare, quarter, and core nice tart apples Make a 
sirup of two quarts of water and one cup of sugar; 
simmer the apples in this until tender, but do not 
break them ; then lay in an earthen dish ; do this until 
they are all cooked. (Do not put many in the sirup at 
a time), and then let the sirup get cool, and turn on 
the apples. 

Baked Pears. 

Put the pears in a deep earthen dish or a baking-pan, 
and to a dozen good sized pears allow half a cup of 
sugar and a pint and a half of water. Bake in a mo- 
derate oven two hours and a half or three. They will 
not keep many days cooked in this manner, but they 
are nice. Sweet apples are cooked in the same manner. 

Stewed Prunes. 

Wash the prunes in warm water and rub them well 
between the hands. Put them in a kettle that you can 
cover tight, with two quarts of water to one of prunes. 
Stew them gently two hours. These will not keep more 
than two days in warm weather, but cooked in this way 
they do not require any sugar, and are very nice. 

Dried Apple Sauce. 
Pick and wash the apples carefully, then place in a 



SAUCES. 199 

preserving kettle. For one pint of dried apple cut the 
thin yellow skin off a lemon, and then pare and cut up 
the inside. Put the yellow skin (be careful not to get 
any of the white) and the inside into the kettle willi 
the apple, and three pints of* cold water. Cover tight, 
and simmer three hours, then put in one pint of sugar, 
but do not stir the apple, and simmer two hours longer. 
Neoer stir dried apple-sauce. 



DRINKS. 

Tea. 

Scald the teapot and pot in the tea, allowing one tea- 
fepoonful to each person ; pour over this half a cup of 
boiling water (soft water is the best), and steep in a 
hot place, but not where it will boil, ten minutes ; then 
turn in all the boiling water you wish, and serve. 

Coffee. 

Put one cup of ground coffee and one pint of cold 
water into the coffee-pot ; set the pot on the fire and 
boil ten minutes after it comes to a boil ; then turn in 
a pint of boiling water and a piece of salt fish skin about 
an inch square. Boil ten minutes longer, then turn in 
half a cup of cold water and set one side five min- 
utes ; turn into another pot. and send to the table. Al- 
ways serve boiled milk with coffee. 

Shells. 

Put one quart of cold water and half a cup of shells 
into the pot, and boil gently four or five hours ; add 
boiling water occasionally. About twenty minutes be- 
fore serving, add one pint of new milk and boiling water 
enough to make three pints in all ; let this boil a few 

minutes, strain and serve. 
200 



DRINKS. 201 



Ohocolate. 



With four spoonfuls of grated chocolate mix one of 
sugar, and wet with one of boiling water. Rub this 
smooth with the bowl of the spoon, and then stir into 
one pint of boiling water ; let this boil up once, and 
then add one pint of good milk ; let this boil up once, 
and serve. 

Prepared Oocoa, 

Prepared cocoa is made the same as chocolate, omitting 
the sugar. All milk may be used if preferred. Never 
boil chocolate or prepared cocoa more than one min- 
ute. Boiling makes it oily. The quicker it is used 
after making the better. 



EGGS. 

Boiled Eggs. 

Put the eggs in a tin basin and pour boiling water 

»ver thcni ; let them stand on a part of the stove where 

they will keep hot, but not boil, for ten minutes, or boil 

in boiling water three minutes and a half. The first 

method is the best. This is for rare done eggs. 

Fried Eggs. 

Ilave boiling lard in the frying-pan ; break the eggs 
into a saucer one at a time, and slide them gently ir.to 
the pan ; now, with a large spoon, dip the boiling lard 
and pour it over the eggs ; do this until they are set, 
then dish. 

Dropped Eggs. 

Turn a quart of boiling water into a basin with one 
spoonful of salt. Break the eggs, one at a time, into a 
saucer ; dip one side of the saucer into the water and 
let the eggs slide gently into it. Boil gently until set, 
which will be in about two minutes, and serve on toast 

Poached Eggs. 

Break and beat up two eggs, and stir into them two 
tablespoonfuls of milk and half a teaspoonful of salt ; put 
202 



EGGS. 203 

them into a basin, with half a spoonful of butter, and 
set over the fire. Stir until it thickens, and then serve. 

Scrabbled Eggs. 

Beat together four eggs, and then turn into a pan 
with one spoonful of melted butter. Stir quickly over a 
hot fire one minute, and serve. 

Omelets. 

Beat lightly two eggs, and stir in one spoonful of 
milk and a pinch of salt. Heat the omelet pan hot, 
and then put in a little bit of butter, and when melted 
turn in the beaten eggs ; set on the fire, shake the pan, 
cook until a light brown ; then fold the omelet and serve 
on a hot dish. Earn, mushroom, lobster, chicken, and 
all kinds of omelets are made by chopping up the meat, 
and laying it between the folds before dishing. 



Miscellaneous Receipts. 



Buttered Toast. 

Beat to a froth one cup of butter and three table- 
epoonfuls of flour ; pour over this one pint and a half 
of boiling water ; set this over a kettle of boiling water 
for ten minutes. Cut bread in slices half an inch thick ; 
toast brown and dip into this. Serve very hot. 

Milk Toast. 

Put one quart of milk in a tin pail or basin, and set into 
a kettle of boiling water. When it comes to a boil stir 
in two spoonfuls of flour, mixed with half a cup of milk, 
one spoonful of butter, and salt to taste ; let this boil 
ten minutes, and then put in the bread, which must be 
toasted brown. Cook five minutes longer and serve. 

French Toast.

MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 205 

Sandwiches. 

Take the pieces of ham which are left on the bone after 
all the slices are cut off and chop rather fine. Cut bread 
into thin slices (the milk yeast is the best for this) and 
butter. Now spread with the ham, and lay another but- 
tered slice over this. Trim the edges. This is a very 
nice dish for evening parties or picnics. Fold them in 
a damp towel until they are sent to the table. They 
may be made by putting slices of cold ham, tongue, 
beef, or chicken between the slices of buttered bread. 



Oyster Stew. 

Drain all the liquor from the oysters ; put it into a 
porcelain kettle, and let it come to a boil ; then skim off 
all the scum. Now turn in the milk, which you have let 
come to aboil in hot water. (Allow one quart of milk 
to one pint of oysters.) Stir in also one spoonful of but- 
ter or more, salt and pepper to taste. Now put in the 
oysters, let them boil up once, and serve with a dish of 
oyster crackers. 

Oorn Starch Oakes. 

One cup of butter, one and a half of sugar, one and a 
half of flour, one half of corn starch, one half of milk, 
four eggs, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one half of 
salcratus. Flavor with lemon. Bake in sheets. This 
will make two sheets, and will keep a month. 



206 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Seed Cakes. 

Butter the size of an egg, two cups of sugar, and four 
of flour, half a teaspoonful of saleratus, and railk to wet

A half of strawberries, and mash fine. When the cake 
is baked, cut in two, and butter each part ; then put 
on the larger portion a layer of sugar, and then straw- 
berries, then a layer of sugar, then lay on the other 
part, and serve immediately. 

Oream Cakes. 

Turn on one cup of butter, one pint of boiling watei . 
Stir two good-sized cups of flour into this, then take ofl 
and cool. When cool, stir in five well-beaten eggs 
Drop on tins and bake. 

Filling. — Make the filling as for cream pies. It will 
take twice the quantity. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 207 

Tapioca Oream. 

Four large spoonfuls of tapioca, just cover with cold 
water, and soak over night. Set one quart of milk on the 
fire to warm. Beat the yolks of four eggs and one cup 
of sugar together. Stir into the boiling milk, with a pinch 
of salt, and then stir in the tapioca. J^eat the whites to 
a stiff froth and stir into the custard, then turn into a 
dish. Flavor with lemon or vanilla. Took like a soft 
cuptard before adding the whites. 

Older Oake. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, foui s>f flour, three 
eggs, half a pint of cider, one teaspoonfu.' i^' soda, spice 
to taste. 

"Veal Loaf. 

Take three and a half pounds of veal h'om fhe leg and 
chop it very fine ; add six powdered crailcrs, half a 
pound of salt pork chopped fine, and two ^ggs well- 
beaten. Season with tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoon- 
ful black pepper, half a teaspoonfnl of allspice, one 
half of ground clove, half a small onion chopped fine ; 
sage or sweet marjorum may be used instead of onion 
if preferred. Knead all this together and make it into 
a loaf, and place it on a tin sheet. Beat ono egg, and 
pour it over the loaf; put bits of butter ou tV"*. top, 
and sift over it half a pound of crackers. Take LiUi \ tear

nutmeg, and with this baste the loaf three or four times 
while baking. Bake two hours. When cold cut in thin 
filices, and serve for either breakfast or tea. 

Lemon Pies. 

Take two lemons and grate away the outside, and not 
use it. Chop the rest very fine ; into two teacups of 
hot water, stir two spoonfuls of corn starch, and boil ; 
add two teacups of sugar ; when cool, add the beaten 
yolks of four eggs and the chopped lemon ; stir well 
together. Line two plates, and pour in the mixture 
and bake. Beat the whites of the eggs to a froth with 
six tablespoonfuls of sugar. Spread this over the pies ; 
set in the oven again and bake a light brown. 

Hop Yeast. 

Extra nice. Into one quart of water in which potatoes 
have been boiled put a pinch of hops, and boil a few 
minutes ; strain, and then stir in one spoonful of sugar 
and one of salt. Let this cool, and when blood warm 
add half a cup of good yeast. It soon foams up like 
beer, and will keep in all temperatures. Put nothing in the 
yeast but the potato water, hops, sugar, salt, and the rising. 

Baked Buckwheat Cakes. 

Mix and rise the buckwheat over night, as for griddle 
cakes, only a little stiffer ; in the morning heat French 
roll pans very hot in the oven ; grease them, turn in 
the batter, and bake. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 209 

Frosting. 

Beat to a froth the white of one egg. Beat into it, 
very gradually, one teacup of powdered sugar, and one 
scant tablespoonful of corn starch, and the juice of 
one lemon Spread this over the cake, then wet a 
clean knife in cold water and smooth the frosting 
with it. Set in a warm, dry place to harden. 

Frosting, Wo. 2, 

Take about one sixteenth part of an ounce of gela- 
tine and put in a bowl ; just moisten with cold water, 
and let it stand half an hour ; then pour on it boiling 
water enough to dissolve ; now stir in powdered sugai 
enough to thicken. Season with lemon, and spread on 
the cake. This is not so handsome as that made with 
the white of an egg, but is made quickly, and will 
harden in half an hour. Frost the cake while it is 
warm, as it dries more quickly and adheres better. 

Whitpot Pudding. 

One cup of Indian meal, one of molasses, a little salt. 
Scald thoroughly with boiling water. Add a quart of 
milk ; pour into the baking-dish and bake one hour, 
stirring thoroughly at least twice while it is baking.

210 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Boiled Indian Pndding. 

Four cups of Indian meal, one cup of beef suet chopped 
fine, one cup of molasses, a little salt. Pour on boiling 
water enough to make a thick batter. Boil in a cloth, 
tied very loosely, two hours or more. Put in the pot 
before the water quite boils. Sei-ve with butter and sirup. 

Spiced Currants, 

Five pounds of currants, four pounds of sugar, one pint 
of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of cloves, two of cinna- 
mon. Stew half an hour. To eat with roast meat.

peel, and chop, with two peppers and one large 
onion. Add one tablespoonfal of salt, two of sugar, one 
teaspoonful each of ginger, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, 
one nutmeg, and two small cups of vinegar. Stew half 
an hour ; bottle while hot. 

Graham Pies. Mrs. C. Thaxter 

Into a pint of Graham flour, stir one teaspoonful of 
salt; wet with boiling water enough to make a stiff 
paste. Roll this very thin, and cut into cakes about 
three inches in diameter ; put into these a spoonful of 
apple-sauce and fold them Bake on tiH sheets. These 
can be eaten by any dyspeptic. 



REMARKS ON DIGESTION. 

In the stomach is produced a liquid secretion called 
the gastric juice. This does not act upon starch or fat 
of any kind. The only thing it dissolves is the albu- 
minous matter. Now, when this albuminous matter is 
not saturated with fat, the gastric juice acts upon it 
readily ; but, as in the case of pastry, doughnuts, fried 
meats, etc., where the whole mass is saturated with a 
fatty substance, it takes a long time before the gastric 
juice can get at the albuminous matter to act upon it ; 
hence the distress by the over working of the stomach ; 
and, if this kind of food is partaken of frequently, the 
stomach force will be weakened, and refuse to do its 
work. This will disarrange every other member of the 
digestive organs ; and, in a short time, you have a first- 
class dyspeptic. All food, therefore, should be as light, 
porus, and free from fat as possible. 

When fat is used, it should be in such a manner that 
it will separate readily from the other substances on 
entering the stomach. Alcohol retards digestion, and 
renders it incomplete, by coagulating the gastric juice. 
Pood, when taken into the stomach either very hot or 
vety odd, does not digest readily. Food taken when 

211 



212 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

the body or mind is very tired does not digest readily. 
Digestion goes on very slowly during sleep ; but it is 
more complete, and repairs the waste of the body more 
thoroughly than the rapid digestion of the walking 
hours Children digest food more rapidly than adults, 
and should therefore be given a light lunch, when more 
than four hours intervene between the regular meals. 

It is a great mistake to think that light breakfasts 
are better than substantial ones. The breakfast sup- 
plies the fuel for the great waste which goes on during 
the busiest part of the day, and therefore should be of 
a simple, nutritious character, and an abundant supply 
of it. Another mistake made by many persons is the 
taking of a number of hours of exercise before break- 
fast. 

The stomach, whi\e empty, is in a condition to re- 
ceive disease. In a high, dry "atmosphere, there is less 
danger from this habit ; but in a country which is at all 
malarious, it is one of the most dangerous things which 
can be done. 

Regularity as to the time of eating is also one of 
the necessary things to be observed, that the digestion 
may be perfect. Pastry should be used very sparingly, 
puddings, fruit, and light deserts taking the place of 
pies 

The preparation of food should be made more a 
matter of conscience, with the housekeeper and cook, 
than it is at present. In planning the preparation of a 
dish, the question should not be. Is it convenient, and 



REMARKS ON DIGESTION. 213 

will it please ? but, Will it be healthful, mentally, mor- 
ally, and physically ? for the food we eat affects all 
three natures. 

Then food, to do its highest and best work, must be 
of the best quality, prepared carefully (but always to 
retain its simplest form), partaken of regularly in a 
chtHTful loom and in cheerful company . 



MEDICINAL. 

Unfailing Onre for Constipation. 

Three teacupfuls of coarse, clean wheat-bran, three 
of sifted flour, one heaping teaspoonful of cream-tartar, 
one-half of soda, one of salt, seven of sweet butuer. 
Mix with cold milk, and roll into thin biscuit ; and bake 
thoroughly in a moderately hot oven. They should be 
from one-fourth to one-third of an inch thick, and be 
cut with a small biscuit-cutter. 

Great care must be taken that they do not burn, and 
at the same time that they get thoroughly baked. They 
will keep a long time if kept in a tight tin box ; and 
they should be eaten at each meal. — From Mr. Leonard 
Scott, after twenty years^ experience. 

Onre, No. 2. 

A little while before retiring, mix a tablespoonful of 
flaxseed in cold water enough to make it pour readily, 
and, on going to bed, drink this. It is not nauseating 
at all, and will act on the bowels without deranging them 
as drugs always do. 

Drinking a glass of cold water at night and in the 
morning helps many persons. Eating fruit is also good. 
214 



MEDICINAL. 215 

Persons having this trouble should eat vegetables, meats, 
hominy, oatmeal, and coarse breads. They should also 
take a great deal of exercise. 

Diarrhoea. 

Brown rice as you would the coffee bean, and then 
either grind or mash in the mortar ; take half a cup of 
the ground rice, and pour about a quart of boiling 
water over it and let it stand about ten or fiftctMi min- 
utes ; then strain and sweeten with loaf sugar and sea- 
son with boiled milk. Drink of this freely. This is par- 
ticularly nice for children. 

Oure No. 2. — Flour Gruel. 

Let one quart of fresh milk come to a boil, and then 
stir in one tablespoonful of flour, which has been mixed 
with milk enough 'to make a smooth paste ; boil this 
mixture thirty minutes, being careful not to let it burn. 
Season with salt and strain. The patient should be kept 
warm and quiet. 

Inflammation of the Bowels, 

Cover the bowels with thin slices of fresh beef, and, 
when they begin to grow dark, remove them and put on 
more fresh beef ; continue this until the inflammation U 
all drawn out. 



216 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Burns. 

Wet saleratus and spread on a cloth ; bind this around the 
hurnt part, and, in few hours, it will be nearly well, unless 
ihe burn is very deep, in which case the saleratus should 
6e removed ; and after being removed the burn should 
be covered with a piece of old linen on which has been 
/"^bbed a little mutton tallow or sweet oil. 

Neuralgia. 

One of the causes of neuralgia is constipation ; and 
fherefore one of the first things to do is to get the 
bowels in a healthy condition. 

A poultice made from the common white bean is a 
great relief Boil the beans in water enough to make a 
thick paste ; mash them, and spread the paste thickly on 
a cloth : then cover the paste with a thin piece of muslin, 
and bind on the painful parts. The bean poultice will 
retain heal longer than one made of any thing else ; and, 
as heat and moisture opens the pores, it thus relieves the 
pain. Qot oatmeal gruel heats the system quickly and 
thoroughly, for which reason it should be taken freely 
in all cases of colds, neuralgia, and rheumatism. 

Growing-in-Nails. 

When the nails are trimmed cut a deep place in the 
centre of any that have a tendency to grow into the 
flesh. The incknation of the parts of the nail to grow 
together will keep it out of the flesh. 



MEDICINAL. 217 



Roll a piece of soft paper quite hard, and pack hard 
between the upper lip and gum, and in a few minutes 
the bleeding will stop. 

Oure for Hoarseness. 

Bake a lemon or sour orange for twenty minutes in 
a moderate oven ; then open it at one end, and dig out 
the inside, which sweeten with sugar or molasses, and 
eat. This will cure hoareness and remove pressure from 
the lungs. 

Under the heading of " Medicinal " I do not give any 
rules that will take the place of a physician in cases of 
severe sickness ; but I give simple remedies which have 
been thoroughly tested, and which 1 hope may relievo 
many others by being thus made public. 



MISCELLANEOUS 



Mock Bisque Soup. — Very nice. 

Stew one can of tomatoes (one quart can). While 
the tomatoes are stewing, put three pints of milk on to 
boil; setting the basin in which the milk is into another

tablespoonfnl of flour, which has been thoroughly mixed 
with a little cold milk. Let this boil ten minutes, and 
then add butter the size of an egg, salt and pepper to 
tai=?te. The tomatoes, which were put on at the same 
time with the milk, are now ready io strain into the 
mixture. Just before straining, stir a pinch of saleratus

mediately. 

Ohicken Pillau, — A Southern Dish. 

Cut a chicken into pieces the size you wish to serve 
at table, then wash clean and put into the stewpan 
with about one-eighth of a pound of salt pork, which 
has been cut up into small pieces. Cover this with 
cold water, and boil gently until the chicken begins to 
grow tender, which will be in about one hour, unless 
the chicken is old. Now Bcason the liquor and chicken

with salt and pepper, rather highly, and add three tea- 
cups of rice, which has been picked and washed, and 
let it boil thirty or torty minutes longer. 

There should be a good quart of liquor in the stew- 
pan when the rico is added. Care must be taken that 
it does not burn. Pork or any other kind of meat can 
be used. 

To Pickle Oysters. 

Two hundred large oysters, one-half pint of vinegar, 
one-half pint of white-wine, four spoonfuls of salt, six 
spoonfuls of whole black pepper, and a little mace. 
Strain the liquor, and add the aboved-named ingredi- 
ents, then put on the fire and boil up, and pour while 
boiling hot over the oysters, and let them stand ten 
minutes : then pour the liquor off them and let 
both oysters and liquor get cold; then put the oysters 
in a jar with the liquor, and cover tight. They will 
keep some time. 

Oatmeal. 

Oatmeal, Indian meal, and hominy all require two 
things to make them perfect : that is, plenty of water 
when first put on" to boil, and a long time to boil. 

Have about two quarts of boiling water in a large 
stewpan, and into it stir one cup of oatmeal, which 
you have already wet with cold water ; boil this an 
hour, * stirring often, and then add half a spoonful of 
salt and boil an hour longer. If it should get too stiff 



220 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

add more boiling water ; or, if too thio, boil a little 
longer : you cannot boil it too much. 

The only trouble there is in cooking oatmeal is that 
it takes a long time, and surely no one will let that 
stand in the way when it is so much better for having 
the extra time. It is also very necessary that there be 
an abundance of water to begin with ; if not, it will 
never be as good, no matter how much may be added 
after it has been cooking any time. 

Hominy. 

Wash in two waters one cup of hominy, then stir it 
into one quart of boiling water with a little salt, and 
boil from thirty to sixty minutes : it is better boiled 
sixty than thirty. Be careful that it does not burn. 
Hominy can be used more than oatmeal, as it can be 
eaten with any kind of meat, and should be cooked 
once a day. It is nice and appropriate for any meal. 
It is also good eaten warm or cold with milk. 

Hominy Griddle-cakes. 

To one pint of warm, boiled hominy add a pint of 
milk or water, and flour enough to make a thin batter ; 
beat up two or three eggs, and stir them into the bat- 
ter with a little salt. Fry as any other griddle-cake. 
They are delicious. 

Waffles. 

One pint of sifted flour, milk enough to make a thin 



MISCELLANEOUS. 221 

batter, which will be about two-thirds of a pint, a small 
piece of butter melted (about a tablespoonful after being 
melted), two eggs beaten very light, a little salt. Mix 
the milk with the flour gradually until it i.i a smooth 
paste, then the salt and molted butter and last the well- 
beaten eggs. Have the waffle-irons about as hot as a 
griddle for cakes, and butter them well. Pour in 
enough of the batter to cover the iron, and put the 
other side down gently on it Let it stand over the fire 
about thirty seconds, and then turn over and let the 
other side remain to the fire the same time, then remove 
and place where they will keep warm until there are 
enough cooked to serve. 

Many persons butter the waffles as they place them 
on the dish, and others add sugar. It is very well to 
do so if that is known to be the taste of all the family ; 
but it is always safe to let people do those things at the 
table. 

Waffles can be made with batters — given under the 
rules for bread, rice, and Indian griddle-cakes, also 
hominy. 

Togus Bread. 

Three cups of sweet milk and one of sour, three cups 
of Indian meal and one of flour, one half-cup of mo-

cake, and break up in one pint of blood-warm water ; 
Btir until it is thoroughly softened, then from your two 
quarts of flour take enough to make a thin batter, and 
set where it will keep warm for about two hours If 
the yeast is good, it will be a sponge in that time. 
Now, take the remainder of your flour, and proceed as 
for " Bread No. 2," in the first part of the book, of 
courpe omitting the flour and water, and using only 
half as much salt and sugar, 

Oake without Eggs.

Hard Gringerbread. 

Very nice. One cup of sugar, one of butter, oue- 
third of molasses, one-half of sour milk or cream, one 
teaspoonful of saleratus, one tablespoonful of ginger, 
flour enough to roll. Roll thin, and cut in oblong 
pieces, and bake quickly. Care must be taken that 
there is not too much flour mixed in with the dough. AH 
kinds of cakes that are rolled should have no more flour, 
than is absolutely necessary to work it. 

Jumbles. 

Three cups of sugar, two of butter, five of flour, one 
egg, half a teaspoonful of soda, flavor to taste. Roll 
thin, eprinkle with sugar, and cut with a cutter that

thin, cut into small cakes, and bake in a quick oven. 
There must not be a grain more flour used than what 
is given in the rule. The room that they are made in 
must be rather cool, and thoy cannot be made in very 
warm weather. They will keep a long time, and are 
perfectly delicious. 

Sponge Rusk. 

Two cups of sugar, one of butter, two oi' milk, one of 
yeast, three eggs. Rub butter, sugar, and eggs to- 
gether, add milk and yeast and flour enough to make a

biscuit, and then shape and put in the pan in which it is 
to be baked, and let it stand two or three hours (three 
hours unless it is very warm weather), and bake in a 
moderate oven about forty minutes. 



MISCELI.ANEOUS. 225

of sifted flour, six pounds of fruit, one pint of wine, 
one pint of yeast, eight nutmegs, mace, twelve eggs,

Glacie Cake. 

Make rich cup-cake and bake in sheets. When nearly 
sold, frost with the following preparation : Wet with 
eold water a small pinch of Cox's Sparkling Gelatine. 
When ready to frost the cake, dissolve this in about 
one-fourth of a wineglass of boiling water, and then thick- 
en with powdered sugar ; flavor with lemon, and spread 
on the cake. This will harden in fifteen or twenty min- 
utes, and cuts nicely the first day, but is not so good to 
keep as that made with the white of egg. 

Golden Frosting. 

Into the yolks of two eggs stir powdered sugar 
enough to thicken, and flavor strong with lemon. This 
does not have as good a flavor as the other kinds, but 
it makes a change. 

Chocolate Pies.

plates, having the cakes thick enough to split. Split 
them and spread one half with the following filling, then 
place the top piece on and sprinkle with powdered

made in the following manner : — 

One teacup of powdered sugar, one-half of butter, one 
egg, two teaspoonfuls of boiling water, and one of brandy. 
Beat the butter to a cream, and then add very gradu- 
ally the sugar beat in the yolk of the egg, and, when 
perfectly creamy, add the white, which has been beaten 
to a froth, then add the water and stir it very carefully. 
The brandy should be beaten with the butter and sugar. 

Eachel Pudding. 
One quart of bread crumbs, one of apples, cot up very

fine, half a cup of suet, which has been chopped very 
fine, one cup of English currants, rind and juice of two 
lonioiis, four eggs well beaten. Mix thoroughly, grease 
a pudding-mould, and put in the mixture. Steam three 
hours. Serve with rich wine sauce.

One box of Cox^s Sparkling Gelatine. Soak one hour 
in one pint of cold water, and then add one pint 
uf feoi7tnp water, and one pint of wine, the juice of four 
lemons, and three large cups of sugar. Beat the whites 
of four eggs to a stiff froth, and stir in the jelly when 
it begins to thicken ; pour into a large mould, set in ice- 
water in a cool place, and, when ready to serve, turn out 
as you would jelly, only that you have the pudding in a 
deep dish.

Set the kettle into a pan of hot water, and stir until it 
begins to thicken like soft custard. 



232 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Have ready the whites of the egg^ beaten to a stiff 
froth ; and, the moment you take the kettle from the 
fire, stir them in quickly, and turn into the moulds. Set 
away in a cold place to harden. 

When you cannot get cream to make Charlotte Russe 
with, this makes a good filling, if you omit the whites 
and fill your moulds when the cream is perfectly cold 
but not yet hardened. 



Red Grout. 

Take currant juice, and add an equal quantity of 
water. Put it over the fire, and, when boiling, add 
four tablespoonfuls of ground rice, which has been mixed 
with half a cup of cold water, to one quart of the liquid. 
Stir carefully until it thickens, then add sugar enough 
to give it a good flavor. Pour into moulds, and set 
away to cool To be eaten with sugar and cream the 
same as blancmange. If you have not the ground rice, 
cornstarch will do. 



Oream Pudding Sauce, 

One cup of powdered sugar, one egg, one-third of a 
cup of cream or milk. Beat the white of the egg to 
a stiff froth, then add the yolk and sugar, and beat well 
Flavor with vanilla, lemon, or wine, and add the cream 
the last thing. This sauce is nice for a light pudding.

Molasses dandy, 

Two Clips of molasses, one of white sugar, one table- 
spoonful of vinegar, a small piece of butter. Boil from 
twenty minutes .to half an hour. Try it by dropping a 
little into cold water: if it hardens, it is ready to cool. 
Pour into a flat, buttered dish, and, when cool, work 
it with the hands. 

Peanut Oandy. 

Prepare the same as the above ; let boil ten minutes 
longer ; and, just before taking off the fire, add a pint 
of nuts, which have been shelled and broken. 

Pour into the dish ; and, before it becomes perfectly 
cold, cut into pieces. 

Ohocolate Gandy. 

One cup of molasses, two of sugar, one of milk, one- 
half of chocolate, a piece of butter half the size of an egg. 

Boil the milk and molasses together, scrape the choc- 
olate fine, and mix with just enough of the boiling milk 
and molasses to moisten : rub it perfectly smooth then, 
with the sugar, stir into the boihng liquid, add the 
butter, and boil twenty minutes. Try as molasses candy ; 
and, if it hardens, pour into a buttered dish. Cut the 
same as nut candy. 

Vinegar Oandy. 
One cup of vinegar, two of white sugar. Boil until 



234 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

it will break brittle when dropped in cold water. Pour 
into a butter-dish, and cut before it gets hard. 

This is nice with nuts for a change. Any kind will 
answer. 

To make Mead. 

One pint and a half of brown sugar, half a pint of 
molasses. Pour on this three pints of boiUng water. 
Let this stand until blood warm, then add two ounces 
of tartaric acid and one of essence of sassafras. 

When cold bottle.

a glass, then fill two-thirds full of cold water, then 
stir in one-fourth of a teaspoonful of soda, and drink 
while foaming. 

To make good Soap. 

Ten pounds of potash, eleven of fat, three or four pails 
of boiling wntor. Pour on and stir until it is dissolved. 
After a few days add boiling water until a proper thick- 
ness. 

Black-Walnut Stain. 

One-fourth of a pound of asphaltum, one-half of bees- 
wax, one gallon of turpentine. If too thin add bees- 
wax ; if too light, asphaltum. Soft pine is the wood 
that stains most readily and prettily. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 235 

Boast Ham. 

Prepare the ham as for boiling, and if good-sized 
(say ten pounds) boil three hours. Take off the skin 
and place in a baking pan. Let it cook in a moderate 
oven two hours, and serve with champagne sauce. 

With one tablespoonful of butter mix thoroughly one 
tablespoonful of flour. Set the saucepan on the fire and 
Ptir constantly until it is a dark brown, then pour into 
it half a pint of boiling gravy, (the liquor in which 
pieces of green meat have been boiling until it is very 
rich). Pour the gravy in slowly, and stir slowly and 
constantly. Let it boil up once, season well with pep- 
per and salt, and strain. Add half a cup of champagne 
and serve. 

Vinaigrette Sauce, 

One teaspoonful of white pepper, one of salt, one-half 
6f mustard, half a cup of vinegar, one tablespoonful of 
oil. Mix salt, pepper, and mustard together, then very 
slowly add the vinegar, and after all is well mixed add 
the oil. To be eaten on cold meats or fish. 

Grraham Bread. 

Where the bread is liked light like the baker*s, this 
is a good rule ; but if the bread be eaten for medici- 
nal purposes the rule in the first part of the book is the 
best. 

Half a cup of yeast, one pint of warm milk or water, 
and flour enough to make a thin batter. Let this rise 



236 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

over night and in the morning stir in half a cup of 
sugar, a little salt, one teaspoonful of saleratus dissolved 
in water and Graham enough to make a very stiff bat- 
ter. All the other ingredients should be thoroughly 
beaten into the sponge before adding the Graham, then 
stir in the Graham a little at a time, and beat well. 
Much depends upon the beating. Shape into loaves 
with the hands, and place in the baking-pans. If the 
weather is warm and the sponge is light the loaves 
will be ready to bake in an hour and a half ; but if 
not warm it will take longer. The oven should not be 
so hot as for white bread. Bake one hour and a half. 



Graham Muffin. —Very Nice, 

Into a bowl put one and a half pints of Graham, half 
a cup of sugar, and a little salt. Now into the seive 
put half a pint of flour, one teaspoonful of saleratus and 
two of cream tartar. Mix thoroughly with the flour, and 
then sift on to the material in the bowl. Mix all the 
ingredients thoi'oughly while dry, and then add two 
well-beaten eggs and milk enough to make a batter 
that will drop from the spoon readily. Fill the muffin- 
cups about two-thirds full, and bake in a quick oven. 



Rye-Muffins. 
Made the same as Graham. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 237 

Sponge Drops. 

Make cake the same as the first rule for sponge cake 
on page 91. Have the mufBn cups very lightly larded, 
and drop a tcaspoonful of the mixture into each cup. 
Bake in a quick oven. These are very nice for a desert 
or for tea. 

Brandied Peaches. 

Weigh your peaches, then throw them a few at a 
time into boiling lye. As soon as the skin begins to 
curl up, drain them and rub the skin smoothly off with 
a cloth, then throw them into cold water. After you 
have finished put them over the fire in boiling water, 
but do not let them boil. When they are soft enough 
to make a dent in them, take them out to cool. Cover 
them with white brandy, and let them stand twenty- 
four hours, then make a syrup of a pound of sugar to 
a pound of peaches, and mix them. Cover them. close, 
and in a few days they will be ready for use. 

Sour-Orange Preserve. 

Grate off the rind and cut the orange into two parts, 
take out all the pulp. Weigh them and place in a 
large stone pot and cover with a brine made from three 
gallons of water and one quart of salt. Let them stand 
in this twenty-four hours and then drain ofi" the brine. 
Cover again with a brine made with the same amount 



238 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

of water and half as much salt as in the first Lot 
them stand twenty-four hours again. Now drain again, 
and cover with clear cold water and let them stand 
in this twenty-four hours. Drain again and put into 
a boiler and covei- with cold water ; let them come to 
a boil and then boil fifteen minutes ; take them out 
^nd drain. Make a syrup of sugar (pound for pound), 
and water enough to dissolve. When the syrup is clear, 
drop in the oranges and boil until they are clear and 
tender, wnich will be in about four hours of slow boil- 
ing. Great care must be taken that they do not scorch. 
They must be stirred every ten or fifteen minutes. The 
sugar may be either white or brown. The orange used 
is not the common market orange, but the wild, sour 
orange found in Florida. 



Pickled Blueberries. 

Nearly fill a jar with ripe berries, and then fill up 
with good molasses, cover, and set away, and in a few 
weeks they will be ready for use. 



To Blanch Almonds. 

Shell the nuts and pour boiling water over them, let 
them stand in the boiling water a minute, and then 
throw them into cold water. Rub between the hands, 
and the dark skin will come off readily. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 239 

To Sweeten Tainted Meat. 

Cover the meat with sweet milk, and let it stand an 
hour or two, and, unless the meat is very bad, it will 
make it perfectly sweet. Soaking in saleratus water is 
also good. 

To Cleanse New Stove Furniture. 

Boil skim-milk in the pots, kettles, pans, &c., and 
then wash in good soap-suds. 

To Eestore Color to Purniture, etc. 

When the color has been taken out of any thing, that 
is painted, by alcohol, rub the place briskly with a 
piece of flannel and kerosene, and, in a few minutes, it 
will turn dark again. 

Marking Cakes in Gold. 

Bake small round cakes ibr the children, and, when 
the frosting is hard on them, dip a small brush in the 
yolk of eg^, and write the child's name on the cake. 
It pleases the little ones very much to see 'their names 
in this way. 

Chocolate Caramel. * 

Three pounds brown sugar, coarse, one-half pound of 
butter, one-half pound of chocolate scraped fine, one 
pint cream or milk. Melt all these together with care,

vanilla to flavor, and stir in half or a whole cup of 
granulated sugar. Pour it in a pan, and, when half 
cool, score it. It should be half an inch thick, and be 
cut up into pieces about an inch square. 

Molasses Oandy.

PEEFACE. 



In offering this little book to the public, I am 
aware that there are many good cook books in the 
market already. But I trust that this will supply 
a want which has always been felt by young house- 
keepers. The great trouble with all the cook books 
which I have known (and I am constantly hearing 
the same complaint) is, that they are too expen- 
sive, and that they use weight instead of measure, 
and also that they take for granted that the young 
housekeeper knows many things which she really 
does not. This want I have endeavored to supply 
in this little volume. Having had years of experi- 
ence as a cook in private families and hotels, I know 
the wants of the masses, and feel competent to sup- 
ply them. 

I have arranged this book in two parts — one for 
plain, and one for rich cooking. In the First Part 

3 



4 PREFACE. 

will be found minute directions for cooking every- 
thing that is within the reach of an ordinary family. 
In Part Second will be found directions for richer 
cooking. There is not one receipt in the book which 
has not been proved to be good. There are very 
few which I have not used myself, and of the value 
of those 1 am fully assured, having seen nearly all 
of them tried. The rules for jellies, charlotte russe, 
and creams will be found to be worth twice the 
price of the book. Many of the visitors to the 
Rockingham House, Portsmouth, N. H., Pavilion 
Hotel, Wolf borough, N. H., McMillan House, North 
Conwa}^, N. H., and the Appledore House, Isle of 
Shoals, will find many dishes with which they ex- 
pressed themselves pleased while the writer was 
pastry cook at those houses. 



PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. 



Five years have passed since the first edition of 
The Appledore Cook Book was given to the pub- 
lic : and, in that time, the author has been adding 
to her store of tried receipts, and now feels it a 
duty and a pleasure to give them to the public. 

The Appendix will be found to have been written 
on the first plan of the book ; that is, that there 
was to be nothing inserted which was not tried and 
practical. 

Mandarin, Fla., April 6, 1877.

THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

PART FIRST. 



FISH. 

Chowder. 

Take either a cod or haddock ; skin it, loosen the skin 
about the head, and draw it down towards the tail, when 
it will peel off easily. Then run your knife down the 
back close to the bone, which you take out. Cut your 
fish in small pieces, and wash in cold water. Put the head 
on to boil in about two quarts of water, and boil twenty 
minutes. For a fish weighing six pounds, pare and slice 
thin five good sized potatoes, and one onion. Place a 
layer of potatoes and onion in the pot, then a layer of 
fish, dredge in a little salt, pepper, and flour. Keep put- 
ing in alternate layers of potatoes and fish until all is used. 
Use about one tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of 
pepper, one teacup of flour, in all. 

Have ready half a pound of salt pork fried brown. 
Pour this over the mixture ; add about two quarts of cold 
water, then strain on the water in which the head ha*

been boiled- If this is not water enough to cover, add 
more cold. Cover tight, and boil gently thirty minutes. 
If not seasoned enough, add what you please. When it 
has boiled twenty minutes, put in six crackers which have 
been soaked three minutes in cold water. If you wish to 
add milk and butter, you can do so about five minutes be- 
fore taking it up ; but for my taste, it is much nicer and 
more natural without either. 

Pish Chowder. Mrs. T. Lcigkton, 

Four pounds of fish, half cod and half haddock, if you 
can get the two kinds, two onions, six potatoes, eight 
white browns, one quarter of a pound of salt pork, salt, 
pepper. Prepare the chowder as directed in the preceding 
rule ; split the crackers and lay on the top, pour over the 
whole hot water enough to cover, and boil fifteen min- 
utes ; then wet two tablcspoonfuis of flour with one third 
of a cup of cream. Stir this into the boiling chowder, let 
it boil up once, and serve. When you cannot get the 
white browns, pilot bread will answer. When a very 
strong flavor of onion is desired, use four onions. 

Clam Chowder. 

When intending to have clams in any form, get them 
in the shell if possible, the day before. Place them in a 
tub, and cover with clean water, and throw into this 
about a quart of Indian meal. This fattens them. When 
ready to use the clams, wash them thoroughly, then cover 



FISH. IS 

them with boiling water, and let them stand ten minutes 
when they will open easily. Take them from the shell, 
cutoff the black heads, and put the bodies of the clams in 
a clean dish. Strain the water in which they were scalded 
into the kettle in which you intend to cook your chowder. 
To one peck of clams allow three quarts of water. Let 
the water come to a boil, then thicken with half a cup of 
flour which has been mixed with cold water, season with 
pepper and salt. Add the clams and a tablespoonful of 
butter ; let it boil ten minutes. A few minutes before 
dishing, drop in three or four broken crackers. 

Clam Chowder, No. 2. 

For one peck of clams take six good-sized potatoes, 
pared and sliced thin, half an onion cut into pieces an 
inch square. Fry quarter of a pound of pork to a nice 
brown ; place the pork and gravy, the potatoes and on- 
ions, in your kettle. Shake over the whole one table- 
spoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of pepper, and half a 
cup of flour. Strain over this four quarts of the water 
with which you scalded the clams. Place on the fire, and 
boil fifteen minutes, then add the clams and four split 
crackers ; boil ten minutes longer, and serve. 

Boiled Cod. 

Take the head and shoulders of a good-sized cod. 
Scrape and wash clean ; rub a handful of salt into it ; 
flour a cloth and pin the fish in it. Put it into boiling 



20 * THE APPJ-EDORE COOK BOOK. 

water, and boil half an hoar. Take the fish carefully from 
the cloth, and serve with egg sauce. Potato is the only 
vegetable that is nice with boiled cod. 



Pried Ood. 

Cut the fish into squares, wash and wipe dry. Take 
half a cup of flour, half a cup of sifted Indian meal, and 
a tablcspoonful of salt. Mix all these thoroughly. Dip 
the fish into the mixture. Ilave ready a frying-pan with 
boiling fat, half lard and half pork fat ; drop in your fish. 
Fry a dark-brown on one side, then turn and fry the same 
on the other side, but be very careful not to let the fish or 
fat burn. Ilave your dish hot, and lay your fish on it. 
Garnish the sides with the fried pork. 



Broiled Ood, or Scrod. 

Split, wash, and wipe dry a small cod. Rub the grid- 
iron with a piece of fat pork, and lay the fish upon it, be- 
ing careful to have the inside downward. If the fish is 
very thick, cook thirty minutes ; but for an ordinary one, 
twenty minutes will be sufficient. Have the dish, in which 
you intend serving it, warm ; place it upon the fish, and 
turn the dish and gridiron over simultaneously. If the 
fish sticks to {lie gridiron, loosen it gently with a knife. 
Have some butter warm, but not melted, with which to 
season it. Shake on a little pepper and salt and send to 
the table. 



FISH. 21 



Baked Cod. 



Scrape and wash clean a cod weighing four or five 
pounds. Rub into it a heaping spoonful of salt. Make 
a dressing of three pounded crackers, a little chopped salt 
Dork, about one teaspoonful of parsley, a little salt aod 
popper, and two tablespoonfuls of cold water. Stuff the 
belly with this, and fasten together with a skewer. Lay 
thin slices of pork on the fish, which should be placed on 
a tin sheet that will fit loosely into the baking-pan ; dredge 
with flour. Pour into the pan about half a pint of cold 
water. Baste the fish often while cooking with the water 
which is in the pan. If the water cooks away, add more, 
but do not have too much to begin with, or the fish will 
be boiled instead of being baked. Bake one hour. When 
the fish is cooked, turn the gravy into a bowl, then lift 
out the fish upon the tin sheet (from which you can easily 
6lide it into the dish upon which you serve it) ; now turn 
your gravy into your baking-pan again, and place it on 
the fire ; when it comes to a boil, thicken with a table- 
spoonful of flour, season with pepper and salt. 

N. B. Always use a tin sheet in the baking-pan when 
cooking fish, as you then can preserve the shape. 



Tongues and Sounds. 

Soak the tongues and sounds in cold water over night. 
Put them in cold water and place on the fire. Let them 
boil thirty minutes, and serve with drawn butter. 



22 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Salt Cod Pish. 

Soak a whole fish in cold water over night ; in the 
morning wash clean, and cut off the tail and fins. If you 
have not a fish kettle, place it in a large milk pan, which 
nearly fill with water, cover, and set over a kettle of warm 
water. Let it cook in this way five or six hours, Serve 
with egg sauce and pork scraps. Potatoes, beets, and 
carrots are the vegetables to be served with salt fish. 
There are but few cooks who know how, or, if they do 
know, who take the pains, to get up a nice salt fish din- 
ner ; but those families who are so fortunate as to have 
this dish well served consider it equal to a turkey dinner ; 
therefore I shall give minute directions for the prepara- 
tion of it. One of the most essential things is to have 
everything hot. Have all your dishes warm, and dish 
quickly, that all may go to the table at once. Serve the 
fish whole ; garnish the dish with a few pieces of beet 
and carrot. Cut your pork, and fry a nice brown. Boil 
an egg ten minutes, dip it into cold water, and peel of the 
shell. Cut it up with a silver spoon, as a knife blackens 
it, and put into the dish in which you intend serving the 
sauce. To a piece of butter the size of an egg, add a 
tablespoonful of flour. Blend these together well, and 
when the dinner is ready to serve, pour on a little less 
than half a pint of boiling water.. Let this come to a boil, 
and pour it upon the egg. Never let drawn butter boil, as 
it becomes oily and unpalatable. The fish which is left 
from the dinner will be very nice for hash and fish balls. 



FISH. 23 

Broiled Salt Pish. 

Cut a square the size you desire, from the thickest part 
of the fish. Take off the skin, and wash clean ; broil 
over clear coals ten minutes, then dip in boiling water, 
butter, and serve. This is a nice relish for breakfast or 
tea, and with boiled potatoes makes an excellent dinner. 

Salt Pish in Cream. 

Tear a piece of fish into small strips, wash clean, and 
place it in a basin with about a quart of water ; let it 
simmer half an hour. Then pour off the water, and add 
one pint of new milk. When this comes to a boil, thicken 
with one spoonful of flour ; let it boil five minutes, then 
add butter the size of a walnut, and a little pepper, and 
6erve. 

Fish Balls. 

Take the fish left from the dinner, put it in your chop- 
ping tray, being careful that there are no bones in it; 
chop fine. Pare and boil potatoes enough to have twice 
the quantity of potatoes that you have of fish. When 
cooked, turn them into the tray with the fish ; mash fine, 
and make into balls about the size of an egg. Flour the 
outside lightly ; have the fat boiling hot, and fry a light 
brown. The fat should be half lard and half salt pork. 
Have the slices of pork a nice brown, and serve with the 
fish balls. 



24 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Another Mode, 

Prepare as above ; and to a quantity that will make a 
dozen balls add an egg, butter half the size of an egg, 
salt and pepper. Shape and fry as before directed. 

Another Mode. « 

Chop fine one good sized beet, and mix welt with one 
pint bowlful of fish and two of potato. Add to this the 
pork scraps left from dinner, or, if none have been left, 
fry a few slices of salt pork, and mix the fat with the fish 
and potato. Shape and fry as directed above. 

Pish Hash. 

Prepare the fish as for fish balls ; chop fine cold pota- 
toes, and mix with the fish. Fry brown six good slices 
of salt pork ; take out the pork and turn the hash into the 
frying-pan ; add half a cup of boiling water ; let this heat 
slowly, stirring often ; then spread smoothly, and brown, 
being careful not to let it burn. When brown, fold it as 
you would an omelet, dish, and garnish the dish with the 
slices of pork. Where pork is objected to, butter can be 
used instead. 

Salt fish, when cooked and chopped, will keep for a 
week, if nothing else is mixed with it. When intending 
to have hash or fish balls for breakfast, the fish should bo 
chopped the night before, and the potatoes should be 
pared and put in cold water. Put the potatoes on the 



FISH. 25 

fire as soon as it begins to burn ; they will then be ready 
for use when you are ready for them. 

Boiled Halibut. 

Pour into a pan about half an inch deep of boiliug 
water ; into this lay the side of the halibut on which is 
the black skin ; let this stand a few minutes ; then scrape 
with a knife, when the black will be found to peel off 
readily. Wash clean in cold water, then pin it in your 
fish-cloth, and drop it into boiling water. For a piece 
weighing four pounds allow twenty-five minutes to boil. 
Serve with irawn butter. 

Pried Halibut. 

Take a slice of halibut, sprinkle with salt, and dredge 
with flour. Fry four slices of salt pork, add to the pork 
fat one spoonful of lard. When boiling hot put in the 
halibut. Fry a light brown on one side, then turn and fry 
the same on the other. Serve the pork with it. 



Broiled Halibut. 

Grease the gridiron with a little butter, place the hali- 
but upon it, sprinkle a little salt over it, and place over 
clear coals. Cook one side ten minutes, then turn and 
cook upon the other side ten more. Have the dish warm ; 
put the fish upon it, season with pepper and butter, and 
send to the table. 



26 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Smoked Halibut. 

Broiled the same as the fresh, omitting the peppei and 
Bait. Smoked salmon cooked in the same way. 

Boiled Salmon. 

Salmon is boiled the same as halibut ; served with egg 
Bauce. 

Pried Salmon. 
The same as halibut. 

Broiled Salmon. 

The same as halibut. 

« 
Salmon Trout. 

When large enough, split down the back, clean and 
broil. Season with butter and salt. When small, open 
far enough to take out the insides ; wash clean, and wipe 
dry. Fry the same as cod fish. 

Shad and Haddock. 
Shad and haddock can be cooked the same as cod. 

Fresh Mackerel Boiled. 

If not cleaned, open them at the gills, take out the in- 
sides, wash clean, and pin in a fish-cloth. (Do not use 
the cloth that you use to boil mackerel in for any other 
fish.) Drop into boiling water, and boil fifteen minutes. 
Serve with drawn butter. 



FISH. 27 



Broiled Mackerel. 



Split down the back and clean. Be careful to scrape 
all the thin black skin from the inside. Wipe drj' and lay 
on the gridiron ; broil on one side a nice brown, then turn 
and brown the other side ; it will not take so long to 
brown the side on which the skin is. (All fish should 
have the side on which the skin is, turned to the fire last, 
as the skin burns easily, and coals are not so hot after you 
have used them ten minutes.) Season with butter, pep- 
per, and salt. 

Pried Mackerel. 

Fry brown six good-sized slices of pork. Prepare your 
mackerel as for broiling. Take out your pork, sprinkle a 
little salt over the mackerel, then fry a nice brown. Serve 
the fried pork with it. 

Baked Mackerel. 

Prepare as for boiling. Make a dressing as for baked 
cod. Stuff with this, dredge with salt and flour. Bake 
thirty minutes, basting often with water, butter, and flour. 
Make a gravy with the water in the pan in which the fish 
is baked. Always make the gravy quite salt. The best 
way to cook mackerel is to broil it. 

To Broil and Fry Salt Mackerel. 
Soak over night, and cook the same as fresh. 



28 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Salt Mackerel in Cream. 

Freshen as for broiled mackerel, then lay into a baking 
pan, and to one mackerel add half a pint of new milk, 
put into the oven, and bake twenty-five minutes. About 
five minutes before it is dished, add a small piece of but- 
ter. This is a nice dish for breakfast and dinner. 

To Boil Salt Mackerel. 

Wash the mackerel, and soak over night in clear cold 
water. Put them on to boil in cold water, and boil gently 
thirty minutes. Serve with drawn butter. 

Smelts. 

The only true way to cook smelts is to fry them, al- 
though they arc sometimes baked. Open them at the 
gills. Draw each smelt separately between your finger 
and thumb, beginning at the tail ; this will press the in- 
sides out. (Some persons never take out the insides, but 
it should be done as much as in any other fish.) Wash 
them clean, and let them drain in a cullender ; then salt 
and roll in a mixture half flour and half Indian meal. 
Have about two inches deep of boiling fat in the frying- 
pan (drippings if you have them ; if not, lard) ; into this 
drop the smelts, and fry brown. Do not put so many in 
that they will be crowded ; if you do, they will not be 
:risp and brown. 

Brook Trout. 
Brook trout are cooked the same as smelts : or you can 



FISH. 



29 



cook them as the angler docs. They must bo split nearly 
to the tail to clean. Wash anddrain. For a dozen good- 
sized trout, fry six slices of salt pork ; when brown, take 
out the pork, and put in the trout. Fry a nice brown on 
all sides. Serve the pork with tbem. 

To Boil Lobster. 

There arc comparatively few who ever have anything to 
do with a lobster until afier it has been boiled ; but for the 
benefit of the few I insert this. Be sure that the lobster 
is living; if not, it is not fit for use. Have a kettle of 
lolling water ; into this drop the lobster, and boil until 
the shell turns red. This takes about an hour. Take up, 
and when cold it is fit to cat. 

Stewed Lobster. 

Take out all the meat from the shell. Chop it, but not fine. 
Put into a basin with alittle salt, pepper, butter, and half a 
cup of water to a small lobster. Stew about ten minutes. 

OuTried Lobster. 

Prepare the lobster as for stew ; when it comes to a 
boil, add a mixture of a heaping tcaspoonful of flour, and 
half a teaspoonful of Indian curry mixed with cold water. 
Let this boil eight minutes, then serve. 

Eels Fried. 
Skin them;, then turn on boiling water, and let them 



£0 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

stand in it a few moments ; then cut them into pieces 
about three inches long. Fry a nice brown, and serve. 

Baked Eels. 

Prepare as for filing- ; then put into a baking-pan, with 
a little water, flour, pepper, and salt. Bake twenty min- 
utes. Make a gravy of the liquor in which they were 
baked, adding a little butter. 

Eemarks in regard to Fish.. 

Fish should never stand in water, as it spoils the flavor. 
Fish should never be fried in butter. It should always bo 
used while fresh. Plain boiled or mashed potatoes should 
always be served with it. Squash and green peas go very 
well with fish also. Always save all that remains after a 
meal, and warm up, to help out another dish. The re- 
mains of boiled fresh fish can be warmed up in a little but- 
ter, pepper, salt, and water, as you would stew lobster. 
Cold fried and broiled fish can be placed in a tin pan, and 
set into the oven ten minutes, when it will be found to be 
hot enough. Fish balls can be steamed for ten or fifteen 
minutes, and then set into the oven to get crisp. If you 
have a large piece of boiled fish, which you wish to serve 
whole, place it on a plate, and set into the steamer, and 
steam twenty minutes. If you have drawn butter to warm 
up, do not set it on the fire, but put it into a bowl, and set 
the bowl into hot water. Cook butter as little as possible, 
as by cooking it becomes oily. When you do use it, al- 
ways add it three or five minutes before taking the dish 
from the fire. 



SOUPS. 

Beef Sotip. 

Every family should have a soup once a week at least. 
Always save the bones of roast meats for a soup. Take 
the bones of a roast of beef, break them up so that they 
will go into a soup-pot. Lay them in the pot, dredge with 
salt, pepper, and flour. Cut into this one small onion ; 
add three quarts of cold water. Set on the fire, and when 
it comes to a boil, skim it. Let it boil gently three hours, 
then add eight sliced potatoes, and boil twenty minutes. 
Have re"ady dumplings ; put them in and cover tight, and 
boil ten minutes longer, then dish. First take out the 
dumplings and place in a small platter, then turn the soup 
into a tureen, being careful to take out the bones, and serve. 

Mutton Broth. 

Take a shoulder or neck of mutton, cut into small 
pieces, wash and put into the soup-pot. When it comes 
to a boil, skim it carefully ; then boil gently two hours. 
To four pounds of meat add four quarts of water, and 
half a cup of rice. Do not put in the rice until the meat 
has boiled two hours, then add rice, and season with pep- 

31 



32 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

per, salt, and half an onion ; boil two hours longer, and 
serve. I will give another method, which is better if the 
soup is the only dish for dinner. 

Mutton Broth. ITo 2. 

Prepare the meat as for No. 1, and to the same quantity 
of meat and water add half an onion, one small white tur- 
nip ; boil two hours, then»add one third of a cup of rice ; 
boil one hour and a half longer, then add six sliced pota- 
toes. Season to taste with pepper and salt. Boil twenty 
minutes, then add the dumplings ; cover tight and boil ten 
minutes, then dish and serve as you would beef soup. 
When preparing the meat for all these kinds of soups, cut 
off all the fat, and fry out for dripping ; thus your soup 
will not be greasy, and you will have the fat free from the 
taste of vegetables. 

Dumplings for Soup. 

Take one pint of flour (measured before it is sifted), 
turn into a seive, and measure into it one teaspoon ful of 
cream of tartar, one half of saleratus, one half of salt, and 
one of sugar. Run this through the sieve, and wet with 
milk ; have the dough stiff enough to roll. Cut into very 
6mall cakes, and cook ten minutes. Be sure that your 
eoup boils fast enough to get up a good steam, and keep 
boiling while the dumplings are in the pot ; if you do not, 
they will be heavy. Some persons like them for a des- 
sert. When used for 'that purpose, they should be eaten 
with sirup. 



soups. 83 

Veal Soup. 

Take four pounds of the neck of veal, cut up small and 
wash clean ; put into the soup-pot and cover with six 
quarts of water ; let this come to a boil, then skim off all 
the 6cum ; boit two hours, add half a cup of rice, and boil 
one hour longer ; then add one third of a cup of flour 
mixed with water, salt, and popper. Boil gently one and 
a half hours, stirring often to prevent burning ; then add 
a tablespoonful of butter, and dumplings made as directed 
for beef and mutton soup. Potatoes and onions can be 
used as for mutton broth No. 2, and some use a little pork 
to flavor it. 

Pea Soup. 

Pick the peas over, that there may be no blemished ones 
among them. Wash and soak over night. In the morn- 
ing turn off the water and put them in the soup-pot. For 
one quart of peas allow eight quarts of cold water and one 
pound of lean salt pork, a small piece of celery, a little 
pepper, and half an onion ; boil gently eight hours, being 
very careful that it does not burn. Have a large wooden 
spoon to stir it with. When done, it should be thin 
enough to pour. In boiling, it may become too thick ; if 
so, add boiling water. When cooked, it is smooth and 
rather mealy. If not cooked enough, after standing a few 
minutes the thick part will settle, and the top look watery. 
Have ready six slices of bread toasted brown, and cut iota 
pieces an inch square ; throw about a dozen of thesf 



34 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

pieces into a tureen, and the remainder send to the table 
dry. Strain the soup through a sieve, and serve. If the 
pork does not salt it enough, use salt. This soup is even 
better warmed over than at first. Some persons use soup 
stock and butter, but it seems to me that it is rich enough 
made in this way, and much healthier. 

The bones left from roast lamb, mutton, and veal can all 
be used to make soups the same as those of roast beef. 



MEATS. 

Boiled Corned Beef. 

Wash a piece of beef weighing ten pounds ; put it into 
two gallons of cold water; when it comes to a boil, skim 
carefully and boil very slowly six hours. Some boil all 
kinds of vegetables in the same pot ; but there is this ob- 
jection to this method ; you lose the distinctive flavor of 
each vegetable, and the beef is flavored with the vege- 
tables, which is very unpleasant when it is cold. The 
vegetables to serve with corned beef are potatoes, cab- 
bage, beets, turnips, parsnips, carrots. When the beef is 
simply for one hot dinner, the part of the beef is not of 
so much consequence ; but when it is to be pressed, there 
should be care taken in the selection of the piece to boil. 
The brisket, the flank, and the thin part of the ribs are 
the best parts to press. Boil as before directed, and take 
out the bones, lay the meat on a large platter, and place 
a tin sheet upon it ; on the sheet place a weight, and set 
in a cool place. When ready to use it, trim the edges, 
and use the trimmings for meat hash. This makes a nice 
dinner with baked potatoes, squash, turnip, and macaroni.

Boiled Salt Tongue. 

Soak the tongue over night ; in the morning put on to 
boil in six quarts of cold water, and boil slowly six hours 
if the tongue is large ; if not, five will answer. Take it 
from the boiling water and throw it into cold water, and 
peel the skin off. Set away to cool. For dinner, use the 
same vegetables as for cold corned beef. The roots will 
make a nice hash. 

Boiled Fresh Tcn^ue. 

o 

Wash and put into four quarts of boiling water, with a 
large handful of salt. Boil slowly six hours, if large. 
When done, throw into cold water and skin the same as 
the salt tongue. The water in which all meats are boiled 
should be saved until cold, and the fat should be taken off 
and clarified. The liquor should never stand in iron ket- 
tles, as it rusts them. 

Boiled Plank of Beef. 

This is a part of the beef that many persons think al- 
most useless ; but by being properly prepared it makes an 
elegant dish. Wash the flank, and make a dressing as 
for turkey, and spread over it, first having salted and pep- 
pered it well, then roll up and tie. Wind the twine round 
it several times, to keep it in place ; then sew in a cloth 
kept for that purpose. Put a small plate in the pot, and 
put in the meat ; then pour on about six quarts of boiling 



MEATS. 87 

water, and boil gently six hours. When done, remove the 
cloth, but not the twine until stone cold ; then cut into 
thin slices, and you will have alternate layers of meat and 
dressing. This is a very nice dish foi breakfast or tea. 

Boiled Ham. 

Have a coarse hair brush for cleaning hams, as it is 
impossible to get them clean by simply washing them. 
If the ham will not fit in the pot, cut off the knuckles, 
which will cook in two hours. Cover with cold water, 
and boil. A ham weighing twelve pounds will require 
five hours. When cooked, take up and put into a bak- 
ing pan, to skin. Have a basin of cold water, into 
which dip the hands ; then take the skin between the 
fingers, and peel as you would an orange. Roll a 
cracker and sift it over the ham, then set in the oven 
thirty minutes. Save the liquor in which it has been 
boiled, and skim the fat for soap grease. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. 

Take a leg weighing eight pounds, and put into six 
quarts of boiling water ; throw into this half a cup of 
rice. In a few minutes a scum will rise, which must 
be skimmed off carefully. Boil one hour and a quar- 
ter ; allow five minutes more for every pound over 
eight. This time will allow the blood to run, which 
should always be the case with mutton. Serve with 
caper sauce. The rice gives it a white look. Serve 
with this plain boiled potatoes, turnips, and onions. 
Save the liquor in which the meat was boiled, for soup. 



38 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Boiled Shoullar of MutLon. 
Cooked and served the same as the leg. 

Eciled Leg or Shoulder of Lamb. 

For a leg or shoulder weighing six pounds, allow an 
hour and twenty minutes, and for every pound over 
that alloTC ten minutes. Serve with drawn butter or 
mint sauce. Serve with it green peas, potatoes, white 
turnips. If asparagus or spinage is in season, substi- 
tute for turnips Save the liquor for soup. Lamb, how- 
ever, is always nicer roasted. 

Eoiled Fowl and Pork. 

Singe, draw out the inwards, being careful to take 
out the lights and crop. Cut open the gizzard and clean. 
"Wash the fowls and put them, with the hearts, livers, 
and gizzards, into boiling water, in which about one 
pound of pork has been boiling three hours. If they 
are young and tender, one hour and a quarter will cook 
one weighing three pounds. If old and tough, they 
sometimes take three hours Truss the same as turkey. 
Serve with drawn butter. Dish the pork with the fowls. 
A little rice boiled in the water give them a white ap- 
pearance. Serve with them mashed turnip, mashed po- 
tatoes, boiled parsnips or green peas, corn or spinage 
when in season. Save the liquor for soup. 



MEATS. 39 

Boiled Veal. 

Take out the bone from a shoulder of veal, and fill 
the cavity with a dressing made as for poultry ; then 
fasten together with a skewer ; wind twine aruund it, and 
tie tight. Put this into a kettle with about a pound 
of lean salt pork, and cover with boiling water. Boil 
slowly four hours, if it weighs ten pounds. Serve with 
celery sauce, or with a gravy made with one pint of 
the liquor in which it has been boiled, thickening with 
one heaping spoonful of flour, salt, pepper, and a little 
butter. Serve with boiled potatoes, macaroni and cheese, 
and horseradish. Save the liquor in which it has been 
boiled, to use next day in making a pie with what re- 
mains from the dinner. 

Boiled Turkey. 

Singe and wash the turkey, then rub into it a hand 
ful of salt ; stuff it with a dressing made by directions 
given under " Dressing for Poultry." Sew up and put 
into boiling water, enough to cover it. For one weigh- 
ing ten pounds allow two hours boiling, and fifteen 
minutes for every added pound. Serve with oyster or 
celery sauce, mashed potatoes, mashed turnips, boiled 
parsnips, plain boiled macaroni. Save the liquor for a 
soup. Sometimes a turkey will be very old and tough, 
in which case it will require a longer time to boil ; but 
a little practice and observation will help every house- 
keeper to understand when to allow more or less twne 
'for boiling. TVuss the name an for coasting. 



40 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Eoast Beef. 

Meats roasted in a tin kitchen require a longer time 
to cook than in an oven, but they arc very much nicer 
cooked in the former. Wring a clean towel out of cold 
water, and wipe the meat with it (if possible, never 
wash beef, as by this means a great deal of juice is 
lost) ; then rub into it a handful of salt, and dredge 
with flour. If cooked in a tin oven, run the spit through 
it. See that the spit is as near through the middle as 
possible ; if not, it will be difficult to turn it. Dredge 
flour into the kitchen, and when brown put in a pint 
of hot water. Cook a piece of beef weighing eight 
pounds an hour and twenty minutes if you wish it rare ; 
if not, cook twenty minutes longer. Baste often with 
pepper, salt, flour, and the water in the bottom of the 
kitchen, and turn often. Ten minutes before dishing 
the dinner, turn the gravy into a basin, and skim of 
all the fat ; let it come to a boil, and thicken with one 
large table-spoonful of flour mixed with cold water ; 
season with salt and pepper. Serve with mashed po- 
tatoes, squash, boiled rice, and pickled beets. When 
baked in the oven, one hour will be sufficient for a 
piece weighing eight pounds. Place a grate in the 
baking-pan, and upon the grate lay the meat. Into the 
pan pour a pint of warm water ; watch carefully that 
the water does not boil away and the gravy become 
burned. Add but little water at a time, for if there is 
too much the meat will be steamed instead of roasted, 



MEATS. 41 

and also the gravy will not become brown. Baste as 
when roasted in a tin oven. Make the gravy as bcibie 
directed. 

Eoast Mutton. 

Take out the first joint from a leg of mutton ; asK 
the butcher to do it when you order it. Wash, and 
rub into it a handful of salt. Cut in around the bone, 
so as to make the cavities as large as possible, and fill 
with a dressing made in the following manner : Soak in 
cold water about two quarts of pieces of stale bread. 
When soft, drain in a cullender ; then mix with this 
half an onion, which has been chopped very fine, one 
teaspoonful of pepper, one tablespoonful of salt, one egg, 
butter the size of an egg, and one tablespoonful of 
summer savory. Fasten together with a skewer, then 
dredge with salt and flour, and roast the same as beef. 
For a piece weighing ten pounds allow one hour and a 
half, and ten minutes for every pound over or under 
that. Skim all the fat from the gravy; for half a pint allow 
one tablespoonful of flour to thicken with ; season with 
pepper and salt. Put one tablespoonful of currant jelly 
into the gravy tureen, and strain the gravy upon it. 
Serve with mashed potatoes, boiled onions, boiled rice 
or macaroni, mashed turnip, currant jelly. 

When the tin kitchen is used it will require half an 
1 our longer to roast The shoulder and saddle are 
cooked in the same way. Always make a dressing for 
mutton ; it spends much better, and the trouble is not 
much. Omit the egg if you please. When you do 
not stuff it, cook it in twenty minutes less time. 



42 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Roast Lamb. 

Take a leg of lamb weighing six pounds, wash and 
dredge with salt and flour. Cook one hour if in an 
oven, one and a quarter if in a tin kitchen. Baste 
often. Make the gravy the same as for mutton, omit- 
ting the jelly. Serve with mashed potatoes, green 
peas, fried parsnips, or green corn, string beans, sum- 
mer squash, mint sauce. Never omit the gravy because 
you have mint sauce. All other parts of the lamb can 
be roasted in the same way. 

Eoast Veal. 

The loin, breast, and fillet are the best parts for 
roasting; the neck also is good to roast. Wash the 
veal, and rub into it a good handful of salt. Make a 
dressing in the following manner, and stuff it: Soak 
about two quarts of stale bread in cold water, chop 
fine half a pound of clear fat pork. Mix this with the 
bread and one teaspoonful of pepper, one of* salt, one 
tablespoonful of sweet marjorum, one of sage, one egg 
or two rolled crackers. Take out all the bones possible, 
and cut slits to make cavities for the dressing ; then stuff 
and skewer securely ; dredge with salt, pepper and flour. 
IIave thin slices of salt pork, which lay on the top of the 
veal. Cook a piece weighing twelve pounds five hours, 
and baste very often. I should alwa} s roast veal in the 
oven. Make the gravy as for roast beef, but do not 
strain. If possible, always cook a large piece of veal, 



MEATS. 43 

because so many nice dishes can be made from cold 
roast veal. Serve mashed potatoes, spinage, asparagus, 
fried parsnips, horseradish. 

Koast Pork. 

Wash and dredge a sparerib with salt, pepper, sage, 
and flour ; and roast the same as beef. Cook a spare- 
rib weighing ten pounds three hours, if cooked in a tin 
kitchen ; if in the oven two hours and a half, liave 
the oven moderately hot. The chine to be cooked in 
the same way, allowing one hour longer for a piece 
weighing the same as a sparerib. Make the gravy as 
directed for roast beef. Serve potatoes, squash, fried 
or boiled onions, boiled rice, mashed turnips, apple- 
sauce. 

Broiled Beefsteak. 

Cut the steak about three quarters of an inch thick. 
Have a clear fire and lay the steak on the gridiron, 
and dredge lightly with flour. If you desire the steak 
rare, cook ten minutes ; if well done, fifteen. Dish 
and season with butter, pepper and salt. Serve imme- 
diately. Never set steak into the oven to keep warm 
or to melt the butter. The dish must be hot, the but- 
ter stand in a warm room long enough to soften but 
do not melt. If for dinner, serve potatoes, either 
baked or boiled and any other vegetables which you 
choose. Many persons pound tough steak before cook- 
ing, but I would not recommend it, as by this mean/ 
it looses much of its juiciness. 



44 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

There arc some families in the country who hare no 
means of broiling. The next best thing such persons 
can do is to heat the frying-pan very hot, and grease 
with just enough butter to prevent the steak from 
sticking ; then lay the steak in, aud cook, and servo 
as before directed. 

Pried Beefsteak. 
For two pounds of steak fry brown four slices of 
salt pork, then take up the pork and fry the steak in 
the fat ; salt and pepper it. When you dish add a 
little butter. To the fat remaining in the frying-pan, 
after the steak has been cooked, add one tablespoonful 
of dry -flour (be sure to have the fat boiling), and stir 
until it is brown and there arc no lumps, then pour in 
about half a cup of boiling water. Season well with 
pepper and salt. Serve in a gravy tureen. This is a 
more economical, but not so healthy a method as 
broiling. 

Beefsteak Smothered in Onions. 
Fry brown four slices of salt pork ; when brown 
take out the pork, and put in six onions sliced thin 
Fry about ten minutes, stirring all the while ; then 
take out all except a thin layer, and upon this lay a 
slice ol steak, then a layer of onions, then steak, and 
cover thick with onions. Dredge each layer with pepper, 
salt and flour. Pour over this one cupful of boiling 
water, and cover tight. Simmer half an hour. When 
you dish, place the steak in the centre of the dish, 



MEATS. 45 

and heap the onions around it Serve the same veget- 
ables as for broiled steak. 

Italianed Beef. 
Broil the steak as before directed ; place in the dish 
and cover with onions prepared in the following man- 
ner : Slice very thin four good-sized onions, and fry 
in pork fat thirty minutes, then add half a cup of 
boiling water, cover tight, and simmer thirty minutes 
longer. While frying, season with pepper, salt and a 
little butter. Vegetables the same as for broiled steak. 

Stewed Beef. 
Take a piece of beef that is rather tough, or pieces 
of tough beefsteak ; rub into it a handful of salt, some 
pepper and flour ; lay in a kettle that you can cover 
tight, and that has a flat bottom. Cut up an onion, 
a potato, a small turnip, a carrot and a parsnip ; lay 
those on the top of the meat and then sprinkle in 
half a tcaspoonful of cinnamon, half of mace, one fourth 
of clove, and add cold water enough to cover it. Let 
it come to a boil, skim off all the scum, then cover 
t : ght, and simmer five hours. After it has been boiling 
four hours, mix half a cup of flour with cold water and 
add to it. You can then taste it, and add more sea- 
soning if necessary. The spice may be omitted if } r ou 
choose. Serve the meat in a little of the gravy, and 
send the remainder of the gravy to the table in the 
gravy-tureen. Serve plain boiled potatoes, boiled rice, 
and pickled beets. 



46 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Fricassee of Boef. 

Put one pint of water into a frying-pan, and when 
it comes to a boil, thicken with one heaping spoonful 
of flour ; season with salt, popper and a little butter. 
Cut cold roast beef into slices, and put into this giavy, 
and let them boil five minutes. If there be any cold 
beef gravy, add it to the other, in which case you will 
not need quite so- much butter. Serve boiled potatoes, 
tomatoes, boiled rice or macaroni and squash. 

Mutton Chops. 

Cut the chops from the loin or the neck ; broil as you 
do beefsteak, and serve in hot dishes. Serve mashed 
potatoes, stewed tomatoes, boiled onions and boiled 
rice. 

Mutton Pie with Tomatoes. 

Pare and slice six tomatoes ; put a layer into a deep 
pudding dish, then put in a layer of slices of cold 
mutton, and dredge in flour, salt and pepper. Have 
the last layer tomatoes, over which sprinkle two rolled 
crackers. Bake one hour. Serve boiled potatoes, boiled 
rice, green corn, shelled beans. 

Mutton Pie, Plain. 
Take the cold mutton that has remained from a for- 
mer dinner, cut into thin slices, put into a pudding 
dish, and season with pepper and salt. Mix two table- 



MEATS. 47 

spoonfuls of flour with cold water, then pour onto this 
one pint of boiling water, and season with pepper and 
salt, then pour this over the meat. Make a paste by 
rule for plain piecrust, and cover it. Bake one hour. 
Vegetables the same as for pie, with tomatoes, with the 
addition of stewed tomatoes. 

Mutton Pricasseo. 
Mutton fricassee is made the same as ty}ef. Heap 
the meat in the centre of the dish, and garnish the 
6ides with boiled rice. Send to the table very hot. 
Serve mashed potatoes, mashed turnips, baked tomatoes 
and shelled beans. 

Haricot of Mutton. 
Take cold mutton (either boiled or roasted), cut into 
slices, and lay in a deep sauce-pan, and then put in 
one fourth of an onion, the same of turnip, and two 
potatoes, and one carrot, all cut into small pieces. 
Dredge with flour, salt and pepper. Cover with cold 
water, and boil slowly one hour; then add two spoon- 
fuls of flour mixed with cold water, and boil one hour 
longer. Ilave a dish ready with an edging of mashed 
potatoes (brown them or not, as you please), and into 
the centre of the dish turn the haricot. Serve mashed 
potatoes, boiled rice, mashed turnips and carrots. 

Minced Mutton. 
Take all the fat from cold mutton, and then put it 
into the chopping-tray ; dredge well with salt, pepper, 



48 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

and flour, and then chop (do not chop it very fine); 
then put into a sauce pan, and to two pounds of meat 
allow one cup of boiling water and a spoonful of but- 
ter. Let it boil gently fifteen minutes, and dish on 
toast. This is a nice dish for breakfast or dinner. 

Lamb Chops. 

Broil fifteen minutes over clear coals. Season with 
butter, pepper, and salt. 

Broiled Veal. 

Cut veal into thin slices, and broil twenty minutes. 
Season with butter, pepper, and salt. This is the most 
unsavory method of cooking veal, and I would not 
recommend it. 

Fricassee of Veal. 

Fry eight slices of salt pork brown. Take out the 
pork and put in thin slices of veal which have been cut 
from the leg. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and fry 
brown. When all the veal is fried, mix with the boil- 
ing fat two tablespoonfuls of dry flour; stir until there 
are do lumps, and the flour is brown ; then add two 
cups of boiling water, and season with salt and pepper. 
Lay the veal in this gravy, and simmer fifteen minutes. 
Dish and pour the gravy over the meat. If for dinner, 
garnish with boiled rice, and serve plain boiled pota- 
toes, spinage, and horseradish. 



MEATS. 49 



Veal Outlets. 

Fry brown eight slices of salt pork. Take them up, 
and add to the fat two large spoonfuls of lard or drip- 
pings. Ilavc ready thin slices of veal (they are best 
cut from the leg), dip them in an egg which has been 
well beaten, then into cracker crumbs, and fry a nice 
brown. Season them, before dipping in the egg and 
cracker, with pepper and salt. Serve with the salt 
pork. If for dinner, serve mashed potatoes, boiled or 
stewed parnips, and horseradish. 



Veal on Toast. 

Chop the veal as for mutton Mince and season in 
the same manner. Use a little more water, and boil 
fifteen minutes ; dish on toast, and garnish with thin 
slices of lemon. This is a nice dish for either dinner 
or breakfast. 

Veal Croquettes. 

Chop cold veal fine (boiled is the nicest), season with 
pepper and salt, and to a quart of veal, after it is 
chopped, add half a cup of warm water (when chop- 
ping the veal, dredge in flour as for veal on toast), 
form this into egg shapes about the size of an egg, 
and dip into a well-beaten egg, then roll in cracker 
crumbs, and iry, as you would doughnuts, in hot lard. 



50 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Pork Steak. 

Cut pork steak quite thin, and sprinkle with salt, 
pepper, and a Utile powdered sage. Put a spoonful of 
drippings or lard in the pan, and lay the pork in it; 
fry slowly fifteen minutes. Always be sure that the 
meat is cooked until white at the centre ; if it has a 
pink appearance, it is not done. If for dinner, serve 
boiled potatoes, squash, boiled onions, and apple-sauce. 

Pried Salt Pork. 

Cut salt pork into slices a quarter of an inch thick, 
cut off the rind, and then pour over them boiling 
water, in which let them stand ten minutes ; then 
turn off the water, and fry until they are brown on 
both sides. 

Broiled Salt Pork. 

Prepare as for fried, and broil ten minutes over clear 
coals. 

Salt Pork Pried in Batter. 

Fry the pork as before directed ; dip in batter, and fry 
in the pork fat, to which should be added two spoon- 
fuls of drippings or lard. Make the batter in the fol- 
lowing manner : Mix gradually with one cup of flour, 
one cup of milk, and then add one well beaten egg and 
a little salt. This makes a pleasant change in the 



MEATS. 51 

country, where it is so difficult to get fresh meat. 
Serve potatoes and any other vegetable that you please. 

Fried Sausages. 

Cut the sausages apart and wash them ; then lay 
them in the pan and pour boiling water over them ; 
let them boii two minutes, then turn off the water 
and prick the sausages with a fork, or they will burst 
open when they begin to fry. Put a little drippings 
in the pan with them, and fry twenty minutes. Turn 
them often that they may be brown on all sides. Cut 
stale bread into fanciful shapes, fry in the sausage fat, 
and garnish the dish with it. Brown bread is delicious 
fried in this way. Serve plain boiled potatoes, squash, 
mashed turnips, and applesauce. 

Broiled Sausages. 

Scald as for fried, and broil as you would any other 
kind of meat. Sausages that are kept a long time De- 
comc dry and hard ; they are very much improved by 
covering them with boiling water in which half a tea- 
spoonful of saleratus has been dissolved, and boiling 
twenty minutes before frying them. 

Pigs' Feet Soused. 

Scrape and wash the pigs' feet. Clean them, cover 
them with salt and water, and let them stand two days ; 
then turn this water off, and cover again with fresh 



52 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Bait and water ; let them stand two days longer, then boil 
about two hours. When cold, split them, and pour 
over them boiling vinegar, in which there have been 
thrown a few whole cloves, a piece of stick cinnamon, 
and a handful of salt. They will be ready for use in 
twenty-four hours. 

Pried Pigs' Feet. 

Put into the frying-pan four spoonfuls of drippings 
or lard, and when this boils, lay in the feet, first hav- 
ing dredged them with flour, and fry brown. Serve on 
hot dishes. They can bo fried before or after being 
soused. Never season them with butter. 

Pigs' Feet Fried in Batter. 

Take the feet from the vinegar and drain them, then 
dip them in a batter made as for pork, and fry in either 
drippings or lard. 

Pigs' Head Cheese. 

Boil a pigs' head until the bones will drop out. 
When cold, chop fine and season highly with pepper, 
salt, and sage ; then put it into a kettle, and to every 
quart of meat add one half a pint of the liquor in 
which it was boiled. Simmer this slowly for half an 
hour, and turn it into deep earthen dishes, and on top 
place a plate with a weight upon it. Set in a cool 
place, and when cold cut in slices. If there is any 
danger of its not keeping, scald it over. Many persons 
put spice in it, but it is more natural without. 



MEATS. 53 



Fried Ham. 



Cut the bam in very thin slices, and cut oft* the rind. 
Have half a spoonful of boiling* drippings in the frying* 
pan, lay the bam in this, and fry quickly eight minutes ; 
it will then be brown and crisp. Where the bam is for 
dinner, have the slices larger and thicker, and if you do 
not have • eggs with it, fry bread, as directed for saus- 
ages. 

Broiled Earn. 

Cut the ham in thin slices ; cut off the rind, and broil 
over clear coals ten minutes. Butter or not, as you 
please. When the ham is very salt or hard, slice, and 
let stand in boiling water ten minutes before frying 
or broiling. 

Earn and Eggs. 

Fry the "ham as before directed, and when the ham 
is all fried, turn the fat into a basin, and scrape the salt 
from the frying-pan ; turn back the fat, and add to it 
half a cup of lard. When this comes to a boil, break 
in your eggs, leaving room to turn them, if you prefer 
them turned ; they look much nicer, however, when 
they are not turned. If they are not turned, dip up the 
boiling fat while they arc cooking and" pour over them ; 
they will cook rare in three minutes, well done in four. 
Lay them on the slices of ham, and serve. 



54 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK, 

Fried Liver. 

Cut cither beef or pork liver into slices about half an 
"inch thick, and pour boiling water over them, in -which 
let them stand twenty miuutes ; then drain, and dredge 
with flour, salt, and pepper. Fry six slices of pork 
brown ; take them up, and in the fat fry the liver fifteen 
minutes. Serve the pork with it. 

Broiled Liver. 

Prepare as for frying, and broil fifteen minutes over 
clear coals. Season with butter, salt, and pepper. 
When for dinner, serve boiled or baked potatoes, squash, 
and macaroni. 

Boiled Tripe. 

Wash a tripe clean (it must be washed in several 
waters), and boil ten hours. Turn it often, as it is apt 
to stick to the bottom. After it has boiled seven hours, 
throw a cupful of salt into the boiler with it. When 
eaten plain boiled, cut up in squares, and serve with 
seasoning of salt, pepper, and butter. 

Broiled Tripe. 

Cut the tripe after it has become cold, into handsome 
squares ; grease the gridiron, and broil ten minutes. 
Season with salt, pepper, and butter. Serve on very 
hot dishes. If you buy tripe, get the honeycomb, as 
that is the nicest part of it. 



MEATS. 55 

Pried Tripe. 

Cut into handsome squares, and dredge with salt, 
popper, and flour, and fry a light brown, in either drip- 
pings or lard. 

Soused Tripe. 

Cut the tripe into squares, and lay them in an earthen 
pot, and pour over them boiling vinegar enough to 
cover, in which a blade of mace, a dozen whole cloves, 
and a stick of cinnamon have been boiled. It will be 
ready for use in twelve hours, and will keep several 
weeks. Soused tripe may be either broiled, or fried 
plain, or in batter. 

Tripe Pried in 'Batter. 

Brain the tripe, and make a batter as for pigs' feet; 
dip the tripe in this, and fry in hot drippings or lard. 
Tripe is nice cooked in this manner, either before or 
after it has been soused. 

Calf's Head and Pluck. 

Take out the brains, and lay them in a dish of cold 
water. Scrape the head and wash, then lay in a tub of 
cold water two hours ; then put into a pot with two 
gallons of cold water. Tic the brains in a cloth, and 
boil with the head. When it comes to a boil, skim care 
fully. When it has boiled two hours, put in the hea vV ,

liver, and feet, and boil two hours longer. When you 
dish, take the bones from the head, and place it in the 
centre of the dish. Cut some slices from the heart and 
liver, and place around the head. Split the feet, and lay 
on the edge of the dish. Serve with brain sauce. To 
make the brain sauce, braid together the brains, half a 
teacup of flour, one teaspoonful of pepper, two of 
salt, one of parsley, one of summer savory. Pour on 
this one pint and a half of boiling water, and let it boil 
twenty minutes, then add one cup of butter and the 
juice of two lemons, and boil five minutes longer. You 
may omit the herbs if you choose. A piece of salt 
pork boiled with the head and pluck is an improve- 
ment, but it is not necessary. The tongue is nice cut 
m thin slices and served cold. The heart, liver, and 
head make a nice hash. Save the liquor to make soup, 
which may be made plain or mock turtle. 

Hash Made from Calf's Head and Pluck. 

Chop together parts of the head, liver, and heart, in 
the proportion of one third each. Season with pepper, 
salt, a little fresh lemon or a little vinegar. Warm in 
just enough of the liquor in which it was boiled, to 
moisten it. Just before dishing stir in a little butter. 
Serve on toast. 

Meat Hash. 
Chop fine any kind of cold meat (before chopping 



MEATS. CM 

dredge with salt and pepper This is always the best 
manner of seasoning hash, as by this means all parts 
will be seasoi.cd alike). If you have cold potatoes, 
chop fine and mix with the meat, if they arc hot, mash. 
Allow one third meat to two thirds potato. Put this 
mixture in the frying-pan with a little water to moisten 
it, and stir in a spoonful of butter, or, if you have nice 
beef.diippings, use that instead of butter. Heat slowly, 
stirring often, and when wanned through, cover and 
let it stand on a moderately hot part of the stove or 
range twenty minutes. When ready to dish, fold as 
you would an omelet, and dish. Save all the trimmings 
and pieces that arc left of all kinds of meat, and have 
a hash once or twice a week. It does not hurt a hash 
to have different kinds of meat in it. Avoid having a 
hash (or indeed any other part of your cooking) greasy. 
It is a great mistake to think that seasoning anything 
highly with butter improves it ; on the contrary, it often 
ruins it by disguising the natural flavor, and giving you 
an unhealthy dish. I have nothing to say against a 
moderate use of butter in cooking, but I do strongly 
protest against the immoderate use of it in soups, grav- 
ies, hashes, stews, and on meats and fish of all kinds. 
I do not know of one kind of soup that is improved by 
the addition of butter. 

Observe, when you let steak stand in the oven or on 
the hearth a few minutes after buttering, 3 7 ou will find 
that the butter has become oily, and you have neither 
the flavor of the meat or butter, but an unpleasant oily

flavor. I havo given only the simplest modes of cooking 
meats in this department, and many may think, peihaps, 
that 1 have been too minute ; but I have not forgotten 
the time when these little hints, as how to put things 
together, as well as the quantities and kinds to take, 
would have been of untold value to me ; and I know 
that every day there arc young housekeepers, and young 
girls who have to work in young housekeepers' kitchens, 
who need just these little hirts to make the simplest 
dishes what they should be. For soups, poultry, and 
richer methods of cooking meats, look in the depart- 
ment for rich cooking.

Boiled Potatoes. 

If the potatoes are new, wash clean and y i\ into 
boiling water; boil thirty minutes, and serve immedi- 
ately. As they grow older, scrape the skin off before 
boiling. For old potatoes, have a sharp knife with a 
thin blade, and pare the potatoes, having the skin as 
thin as possible. They are very much better if they 
stand in cold water a few hours before boiling ; then 
put them in boiling water and boil thirty minutes. 
When they have boiled fifteen minutes, throw in a hand- 
ful of salt. When done, turn off the water and let them 
stand on the back part of the range three minutes, then 
shake them up once and turn into the dish, and send 
to the table. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

Prepare and boil as for plain, and then mash. To two 
dozen potatoes add one cup of boiling milk and one 
spoonful of butter. If they are not salt enough, add a 
little more. They should be dished as soon as mashed. 
Heap them in the dish in an oval form, smooth and in- 
dent with the knife.

Erowncd Potatoes. 

Prepare and mash as for plain mashed potatoes ; then 
heap them in an oval form on a buttered tin sheet. 
Smooth with a knife, and then clip the knife in milk and 
smooth over again, wetting every part with the milk, 
and place in the oven to brown ; they will brown in 
twenty minutes in a hot oven. I would not recommend 
browning potatoes, as the moisture, being baked in, 
spoils the flavor and renders them clammy. They look 
handsome made into pear shapes and browned. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Be very particular to wash every part of the potato 
clean, as many persons eat the skin Put them in a 
pan (have an old one for this purpose), and bake in a 
moderate oven fifty minutes. There is such a difference in 
ovens that each one must learn for herself what the time 
will be for each ; for some will bake in less time, and 
some will take much longer than the time designated.

Fried Potatoes. 

Pare and slice thin raw potatoes, and let them stand 
in cold water several hours ; if in summer, put a piece 
of ice in the water. Cut the slices lengthwise of the po- 
tato. Have ready a basin with boiling drippings or lard, 
drain the potatoes a minute in the cullender, and drop 
them into the boiling fat, and fry a light brown ; take 



VEGETABLES. 61 

them out with a skimmer, and lay them in a dry cul- 
lender, which should be placed in a tin pan and set in 
an open oven. There should be as much fat as for fry 
ing doughnuts, and there should not be any more po 
tatoes put in at a time than will fry brown and not stick 
together. Have the basin in which you fry quite deep 
as there is danger of the fat boiling over when the po 
tatoes are put in. When you take the potatoes up 
dredge a little salt over them. When potatoes arc cooked 
in this manner, they will be light and crisp. If they do 
not get cooked enough at first, they are very much im- 
proved by dropping them into the fat for one minute, 
after they have been standing in the oven a while. 

Fried Boiled Potatoes. 

Cut the potatoes into slices, and fry in cither pork fat 
or nice drippings. Have just fat enough in the pan to 
prevent their sticking, and sprinkle with salt while cook- 
ing. When these are brown, take them up and put in 
a little more fat, and fry as before. 

Potatoes warmed with Pork. 

Cut about eight slices of pork into pieces about half 
an inch square, and fry a nice brown. Ilave ready 
one dozen cold potatoes cut into slices, and turn them 
into the pan with the fried pork, and dredge in a little 
salt and pppper, then stir and cut them into small pieces 
w?th the knife. When a light brown, serve. 



62 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Potatoes warmed in Gravy. 

Slice cold potatoes as for frying', and turn them into 
the frying-pan, and to a dozen potatoes add a pint of 
cold gravy. Season with pepper and salt, and stir, and 
cut with a knife, until they are hot and in small pieces. 

Fricassee of Potatoes. 

Gut cold boiled potatoes into small squares, and put 
them in a basin with milk, pepper, and salt, allowing 
half a pint of milk to a dozen potatoes. Set the basin 
into another of hot water, and when it comes to a boil, 
add a table spoonful of butter, and set on the stove, and 
let it boil up once, then serve. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. 

Wash and boil, with the skins on, forty-five minutes. 
They are much better baked than boiled, and I would 
cook them so generally. 

Baked Sweet Potatoes, 

Wash and wipe dry, and bake one hour. Do not cook 
squash when you have sweet potatoes. 

Boiled Onions. 

When new and tender, they will boil in one hour ; 
but after the month of October, they will require two 



VEGETABLES. 63 

hours. Put thein into water before peeling them, and 
they will not affect the eyes. Peel of all the dark skin, 
and put them in hot water, and boil as directed. If 
you have milk plenty, half an hour before they arc done, 
turn a quart into the water in which they are boiling. 
This makes them white, and is said to prevent, in a 
measure, the disagreeable odor which always follows 
their being eaten. Boil them in a porcelain kettle. 
Dish them whole, and season with a little pepper, salt, 
and butter. 

Pried Onions. 

Peel arid slice thin ten good-sized onions, and put them 
in a frying-pan with two spoonfuls of drippings. Fry 
thirty minutes, turning often. 

Boiled Squash. 

Cut the squash in strips, and cut out the soft, stringy 
part; pare, wash, and cover with boiling water; boil 
twenty-five minutes, then turn into a cullender for a fevv 
minutes, and when all the water is drained off, put it 
back in the basin with a little salt, pepper, and butter, 
and mash. Dish the same as mashed potatoes. 

Baked Squash. 

Cut the squash in two, take out of all the soft, stringy 
part ; if you need the whole squash for dinner, lay the 
halves together, and put in a baking-pan (the old one you 



GJ: THE APFLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

use for baking potatcs in), and bake foity-five minutes, 
When clone, scrape the squash from Ihc shell, and sea- 
son, and serve as boiled squash. When you cook but 
half a squash, lay it with the inside downward. This is 
a nice way to cook watery squash. Squash is also good 
steamed. It will take forty-five minutes to steam. 

Beets. 

Wash clean, but do not scrape ; if you do thej 7- will 
look white when cooked. When young they will cook 
in two hours ; but old ones will require four or five 
hours. When done, plunge them into cold water, and 
the skin will peel off easily. Cut in thin slices, and 
lay in a flat dish. 

Pickled Eeets. 

Cut the beets that are left from dinner into thin slices, 
and lay them in an earthen vessel, and cover with cold 
vinegar and a few whole cloves. Keep in a cold place. 

Shelled Beans. 

Wash in several waters, and put them in a basin with 
boiling water. Boil one hour. Do not drain them very 
dry. Season with butter and salt. 

Baked Beans. 

Examine and wash one quart of dry beans (the pea 
bean is the best), and put them in a pan with six quarts 



VEGETABLES. 65 

of cold water ; let them soak in this over night. In 
the morning wash them in another water, and place 
them on the fire with six quarts of cold water and a 
pound of mixed salt pork. If they arc the present year's 
beans, they will cook enough in half an hour ; if older, 
one hour. Drain them and put half in the bean-pot ; then 
gash the pork, and put in the remainder of the beans, 
one tablespoonful of molasses, and one of salt, and cover 
with boiling water. Bake ten hours. Watch them care- 
fully, and do not let them cook dry. 

String Beans. 

String and cut into pieces about an inch long ; then 
wash and put into boiling water, and boil one hour. 
Season with salt and butter. 

Stewed Beans, 

Wash and soak over night one quart of beans. (Scar- 
let runners are the best.) In the morning set them on 
the fire with six quarts of cold water and one and a 
half pounds of mixed salt pork. They will cook in four 
hours, but are better cooked five. Stir them often to 
prevent burning. Season with pepper before dishing, 
and if the pork does not season it enough, add a little 
salt. 

Green Peas. 

Put them into boiling water, and when very young 
they will cook in twenty minutes ; but generally they 
require thirty. Season with salt and butter. 



DO THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Green Corn. 

Boil twenty-five minutes, if very young and tender. 
As it grows older it requires a longer time. Send to 
the table in a napkin. 

Boiled Turnips. 

Peel and cut into slices. If they are to be served in 
slices, boil with a small piece of pork. Boil the pork 
three hours, and put in the turnips ; if they are the 
white turnip, they will cook in forty-five minutes ; but 
if the }^ellow, they will require two hours. Serve in 
slices without any seasoning except what they get by 
being boiled with the pork. For mashed, cook in the 
same way, omitting the pork, and season with salt, pep- 
per, and butter. When the white turnip is very watery, 
it is improved by mashing a few mealy potatoes with 
it. Dish as directed for mashed potato. 

Boiled Parsnips. 

Scrape very clean, and cut lengthwise into slices. 
Put them into a stew-pan, and cover with water, and 
boil one hour. Serve with a little drawn butter. 

Pried Parsnips. 

Prepare as before directed, and boil half an hour. 
Let them grow cold, and fry a light brown in pork fat 
(Never use butter to fry.) They arc very nice cooked 
whole with a piece of pork, as you cook turnips. The 



VEGETABLES. 67 

time to eat parsnips is in April and May, and they 
should be dug fresh when used. Dig* a large box full 
in the fall, and cover them with earth. Use these for 
soups ; they are one of the nicest vegetables that there 
are for flavoring soups. 

Boiled Carrots. 
Prepare, boil, and serve the same as parsnips. 

Boiled Eice. 

Wash and pick all the specks from a cup of rice. 
Let it stand in cold water two hours, and then put it in 
a deep kettle, with two quarts of water, and boil fast 
thirty minutes. When it has boiled twenty minutes, 
throw in a great spoonful of salt. When done, turn 
into a cullender, and set in the oven a few minutes. 
When ready to dish, shake lightly and turn into the 
vegetable dish. Never use a spoon. If these directions 
are followed, you will have a handsome and healthy 
vegetable, and m every kernel will be separate. The 
water in which the rice has been boiled makes a nice 
starch for Colored clothes. 

The southern rice cooks much quicker and is nicer than 
the Indian rice. If possible, always purchase the former. 

Another Mode. 

Wash one cupful of rice and put into a tin basin or 
pail, with three cupfuls of cold water, and a tcaspoon- 
ful of salt, cover and set in another basin, with hot water. 



08 THE APPLEDORE COOK COOK. 

place on the fire, and boil thirty minutes. Rice is very 
lealthy, and should be a common dish on the table. 



Stewed Tomatoes. 

Pour boiling water over half a peck of ripe tomatoes. 
«jct them stand in it five minutes, and then peel off the 
skins ; cat them into slices, and put in a stew-pan with 
a little salt, pepper, and a spoonful of sugar. Simmer 
two hours, stirring often to prevent burning. Two urin- 
ates before dishing stir in one tablcspoonful of butter. 
Canned tomatoes are cooked in the same manner, but 
do not require more than half an hour to stew. 

Sliced Tomatoes. 

Pour boiling water over them, and then peel and slice 
thin ; lay them on small platters, and serve. Let each 
person season to his own taste. 

Baked Tomatoes. 

Scald and peel as directed ; have ready an earthen 
dish, into which lay a layer of tomatoes (whole), then 
sprinkle with salt, pepper, and cracker crumbs ; then 
another layer of tomatoes, and sprinkle again with salt 
and pepper. Cut a spoonful of butter into small pieces 
and lay on the tomatoes, and then cover with cracker 
crumbs. Bake thirty minutes.

Asparagus. 

Cut off the white part, wash and tie in small bunches, 
and put into a sauce-pan with boiling water enough to 
cover it, and a handful of salt. When young it will 
boil in twenty minutes ; if not tender, boil thirty. Dish 
on toast, and season with a little butter. 

Spiuage. • 

Pick carefully and see that there arc no weeds or 
grass in it ; then wash in several waters. Put on to 
boil in boiling water, and boil an hour and a half. 
When about half done, throw into the water a spoon- 
ful of salt. When done, drain and put in a dish with 
a little butter, and cut it several times with a knife. 
Dish and garnish with slices of hard-boiled egg. You 
can boil it with a piece of salt pork, and then you will 
not require the butter and eggs. 

Cabbage. 

Cut the stalk and all the loose leaves from the cab- 
bage ; then cut the cabbage into four parts, and wash 
clean Examine it carefully, as there are worms in it 
sometimes. Put it in a deep pan, and pour boiling water 
over U, and let it stand in the shed (that it may not 
scent the house) half an hour. Boil with a small piece 
of salt pork two hours, or you can boil it with corned 
beef, as many persons do ; but it has not the- white 
appearance that it has when boiled with pork. When

of corned beef. 

Cauliflower. 

Cut off the loose leaves and the stock; wash clean, 
and let it stand in cold water one hour ; then put on 
to boil in boiling water, and if very large, boil one 
hour and a half; but if small, one hour will answer. 
When nearly done, stir in a spoonful of salt and half 
a pint of milk. Serve whole in a deep dish, and 
spread over it a little butter. The milk can be omitted, 
as its only use is to whiten tho cauliflower. 

Dandelions. 

Pick over carefully, and wash in several waters ; cut 
off all the roots, then put into boiling water, and boil 
one hour ; then drain off this water, and again put them 
into boiling water, and boil two hours longer. Put a 
spoonful of salt into the second water. When done, turn 
into a cullender and drain ; then season with butter and 
more salt if necessary, and cut them with a knife. 
Serve in a deep vegetable dish. They may be boiled 
with a piece of salt pork, but in that case omit the butter. 

Beet Greens. 

Scrape the roots and wash in several waters ; then 
let them stand in cold water a few hours. Boil a small 
piece of salt pork three hours, then put the beet greens 
into the kettle with it, and boil one hour longer.

Macaroni Boiled. 

Break up and wash a pint bowl full of macaroni, and 
put in a shallow basin, and cover with cold water. 
Set this basin into another of warm water, and place on 
tfic fire ; after fifteen minutes, add a pint of milk and a 
teaspoonful of salt; let it cook ten minutes longer, 
then add a spoonful of butter, and cook five minutes 
more, and dish. Be careful not to break the macaroni 
in dishing. The boiled macaroni which remains from 
one dinner can be used for the next, by preparing it 
in the following manner : Butter a shallow dish, and 
turn the macaroni into it ; then grate over it old cheese, 
and brown. 



BREAD. 

Always purchase the best flour ; it is much cheaper 
than the low priced. Keep a large tin pan or wooden 
bowl full of sifted flour, and always keep the flour 
covered Have two quarts, one for dry, and the other 
for liquid measuring. The old beer measure is the 
kind to get. If you buy milk, it will not do to con- 
sider the milkman's quart for any rule in this book. 
You must always measure with the beer measure. 
Good bread is the most important branch of cooking. 
Therefore 1 hope every housekeeper, who cannot already 
make good bread, will give particular attention to this 
branch before attending to cake or pastry of any kind. 
It seems as if enough had been written and said, in 
regard to this subject, to awaken every j r oung woman 
to the importance of it ; but it is not so. If a young 
lady learns to do any kind of cooking, it is cake and 
pastry, and if she learns to make bread, it is the last 
thing, instead of the first, to be learned. Now I cer- 
tainly think that no girl should pass her eighteenth 
year without a practical knowledge of bread-making, 
cooking vegetables and plain meats. I have no objec- 
tions to all the nice fancy cooking, which any one may 
learn afterwards ; but have bread, vegetables, and meats 
first. When reading a rule for doing anything, it seems 

72 



BREAD. 73 

as if the process were longer and harder than when the 
'rule is very short. But I hope none will feel so because 
I have gone into all the details, for I feel that it is be- 
cause of the neglect of the small things that so many- 
fail in cooking, as in everything else. 

Hop Yeast. 
Pare and boil one dozen mealy potatoes (they will 
boil in thirty minutes); as soon as you put the potatoes 
on to boil, put a handful of hops into another kettle with 
three quarts of cold water, cover and boil (watch it that 
it may not boil over). When the potatoes are boiled, 
drain and mash fine ; then strain the hops through a 
fine sieve on the potatoes (be sure that the hops are 
boiling when they are strained on the potatoes), and stir 
well ; then add one half a cup of sugar, one fourth of 
salt, and one pint of flour ; mix this well and strain 
through a cullender ; let it stand until it is milk-warm, 
then stir in one cup of good yeast, and set it to rise 
where it will be warm. It will rise in five hours if the 
yeast is good. You can tell when it is risen by the 
white foam, which will rise to the top When risen, put 
it in a stone jug, and stop tight. It is a good plan to 
tie the cork down, as it sometimes flies out. Set in the 
ice chest or on the cellar bottom. Make one third this 
quantity in summer if your family be small. 

Hop Yeast, No. 2. 
In the spring and the first of the summer, when 
potatoes are poor, it is better to make yeast without 



74 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

them. Boil one fourth of a cup of hops in one quart of 
water, and strain it upon a half a pint of flour ; stir 
this well, and add two spoonfuls of sugar and one of 
salt, then strain through a cullender, and let it become 
milk-warm, when add one cup of good yeast. You 
need just as much yeast for one third the quantity 
made without potatoes, as you would for the whole 
made with potatoes. Rise and bottle the same as the 
preceding. 

Potato Yeast. 

Pare and boil six good-sized potatoes ; when done, 
mash, and pour on them three pints of boiling water; 
run this through the cullender, and then stir in one 
spoonful of sugar and one of salt. When milk-warm, 
stir in half a cup of yeast. In summer time this will 
rise in three or four hours. It will not keep as long as 
hop yeast. 

Yeast Bread. 

Take four good-sized potatoes, peel, boil, and mash, 
and pour on to them one quart of boiling water ; strain 
the whole through a sieve ; l let this get blood-warm, and 
then stir into it one cup of yeast, one spoonful of white 
*ugar, one spoonful of salt, and three quarts and a pint 
of flour. Beat well with a spoon and set in a warm place 
to rise. (In the summer it will rise in four hours, in 
winter it will take five.) When well risen, take a pint of 
flour and put part of it on the kneading-board ; then turn 
the dough upon the board, and put one spoonful of lard 



BREAD. 75 

on it; then knead twenty minutes, using the pint of 
flour ; now put the dough in the pan again, and let it 
rise one hour, and then form into loaves. (Do not have 
over a pint bowl full of dough in a loaf ) Let the loaves 
rise forty minutes, and bake forty-five minutes. Bread 
made in this way cannot be excelled ; the only objection 
to it is that you have to bake in the afternoon; but 
when good bread is wanted, a little extra work should 
not prevent it being made. 

Yeast Bread, No. 2. 

Make a hole in the middle of four quarts of flour, into 
which turn one spoonful of sugar, one of salt, and one 
cup of yeast ; then mix with one pint of cold milk, which 
has been warmed by the addition of one pint of boiling 
water, and add one spoonful of lard ; knead well, and 
let it rise over night. In winter, let it begin to rise near 
the fire the first of the evening, unless your kitchen is 
very warm. But in summer do not mix until nine, un- 
less you intend baking before breakfast. In the morning 
knead again, and make into loaves ; let them rise one 
hour, and bake fifty minutes. If you have not plenty of 
milk, mix with water, and use one spoonful more of lard. 
There is a great deal in knowing how to knead ; strength 
is not all, as many suppose. When you put the bread 
on the board, mix it lightly, and when you begin to 
knead it, do not press down, but let all your motions be 
as elastic as possible ; knead with the palm of the hand 
until the dough is a flat cake, then fold, and keep doing 



76 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

this antil the dough is smooth and elastic ; twenty min- 
utes is the time I have given, but many persons can knead 
the bread in less time, while others will require longer. 
But practice will teach each one. . 

Milk Yeast Bread. 
Put into a two-quarts-and-a-pint pail one pint of new 
milk, and one pint of boiling water ; mix with this one 
tablespoonful of white sugar, one of salt, and three pints 
of flour. Beat this well together, and cover tight (have 
a spoon that is so short that you can put the cover on the 
pail while it is in it, and yet it must be long enough to 
come nearly to the top ) Set this pail into another pail, 
or kettle, with water enough to come nearly to the top of 
it. To get this water the right temperature, take one half 
cold and one half boiling water ; set it where it will keep 
about the same temperature until risen ; watch carefully, 
and beat the batter as often as once in every half hour 
until the last hour, when it must not be disturbed. This 
will rise in about five hours ; when it is risen the pail 
will be full. Do not let it stand one minute after that, as 
it spoils very quickly. Have in a pan two quarts of 
flour, make a hole in the middle of it. Dissolve a teaspoon- 
ful of saleratus in a little hot water, and when the batter 
is risen turn it into the middle of the flour, and turn the 
saleratus in with it ; then knead well, and make into 
loaves. Set them where they will be warm, and let them 
rise forty-five minutes. Bake in a quick oven. It will take 
nearly a pint of flour to knead the dough on the board. 



BREAD. 77 

Bo as particular to meisure your flour as you are to 
measure the milk and water. This bread is not so health- 
ful as hop yeast bread, and is more difficult to make ; but 
it makes the nicest dry toast and delicious sandwiches. 

Graham Bread. 

Take two quarts of Graham (never sift it) and one of 
. flour, half a cup of yeast, one scant spoonful of salt, half 
a cup of brown sugar, and warm water enough to make a 
stiff batter, and let it rise. If you rise it over night, be 
sure to set it in a cool place, as it sours much quicker 
than fine flour. It will rise iu a warm place in four 
hours. When risen, mix with it a teaspoonful of salcratus 
dissolved in warm water, and flour enough to shape it 
into loaves; put it in the pans, and let it rise thirty- 
five minutes, and bake slowly an hour and a quarter. 
Make the loaves very small. Use molasses instead of 
sugar if the bread is eaten for constipation. 

Third Bread. 
Take one quart of flour, one of Indian meal, one of rye, 
one cup of yeast, one spoonful of salt, half a cup of 
brown sugar, and nearly a quart of warm water ; mix well 
together, and let it rise over night. In the morning use 
flour enough to shape it into loaves, and let it rise in the 
baking-pans forty-five minutes. Bake one hour and a 
quarter. 

Brown Bread. 
Take one heaping pint bowlful of rye meal, two of 
Indian, one cup of yeast, one of molasses, one spoonful

of salt, one teaspoonful saleratus. Mix with warm 
water, as thick as hasty pudding. Lard the dish in 
which it is to be baked, and then turn in the mixture ; let 
it rise two hours, and bake in a slow oven four hours. 

Brown Bread, No. 2. 

Very nice. Three cups of Indian meal, three of rye, 
one half of molasses, one spoonful of salt, one teaspoon- 
ful of saleratus ; wet with one quart and a fourth of 
milk. Steam five or six hours. This will make enough 
to fill a two quart pan. 

Brown Bread, No. 3. 

Nice. One pint of sour milk, half a cup of molasses, 
one teaspoonful saleratus, one tablespoonful salt, half In- 
dian and half rye meal enough to make a stiff batter ; 
lard the baking-tin well, and turn in the mixture. Steam 
five hours. I will say here that you cannot steam brown 
bread too much ; but do not steam it less than five hours. 

Eaised Biscuit. 

If the biscuit are for breakfast, take part of the dough 
of yeast bread No. 2, and mould with the hands very 
small cakes, place them in a shallow pan, and rise one 
hour. Bake in a quick oven thirty minutes. Never cut 
raised biscuit with a cutter ; they are enough nicer for 
being moulded by the hand to pay for the extra labor. 
When the biscuit are for tea, take part of the dough of 



BREAD. 79 

No. 1, and proceed as directed for breakfast biscuit. 
When the supper hour is six, do not set your bread until 
ten, if in summer, but if in winter, half past eight. Begin 
to make the biscuit two houis before supper-time; by 
this means you will have plenty of time to rise them. 
Shape the loaves at the same time, and they can be 
baked while you are getting supper. 

Kaised Biscuit, Ho. 2. 
Take three quarts of flour and one cup of butter, one 
of yeast, one spoonful of salt, one of sugar. Melt the 
butter and mix with a scant quart of warm milk ; wet 
the flour with this, and set in a warm place to rise. 
When it cracks open it is risen enough. When it is 
risen, work into it two teaspoonfuls of saleratus which 
have been dissolved in half a cup of hot water. You 
must work it very thoroughly, or the saleratus will not be 
mixed with every part. Now put the dough into large tin 
pans or pails (do not have the vessels more than half full, 
as the dough will rise again), and set them on the ice. 
This dough will not be fit to use under twelve hours, 
as it must be chilled through. W T hen you wish to 
make biscuit, take part of this dough and lay on the 
paste board, and roll about an inch thick ; cut in small 
cakes, and bake fifteen minutes in a quick oven. Handle 
the dough as little as possible, and keep very cold 
until you put it in the oven This is a very nice way 
to make biscuit where the family have hot bread twice 
a day, as it will keep five days ; but tber^ must be a 
good ice-chest, and plenty of ice to have it work well.

White Mountain Eolls. 

For breakfast. Sixteen cups of flour, one half a cup 
of white sugar, one cup of butter, one of yeast, the 
whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and four 
cups of boiled milk. Melt the butter, have the milk blood- 
warm, and mix the bread ; set in a warm place, and 
rise over night; in the morning shape into long rolls 
rise one hour, and bake half an hour. 

Parker House Eolls. 
Take two quarts of flour, and rub into it a table- 
spoonful of lard and a little salt ; put in a deep bread- 
pan, and make a hole in the flour, into which pour one 
pint of cold boiled milk and half a cup of yeast. Cover 
the pan, and let it stand all night ; in the morning 
stir it up and knead well, and set in a warm place to 
rise ; let it rise to a light sponge (it will rise in an 
hour a half), then roll it out on the board about half 
an inch thick ; cut with an oval cutter, and fold about 
two thirds of it ; lay them on tin sheets ; let them 
rise an hour, and then bake in a quick oven fifteen 
minutes. If you have breakfast at seven, you must be 
up at four to have them ready. 

Coffee Eolls. 

Take twelve cups of flour, one of white sugar, one 

half of butter or lard, one of yeast, one grated nutmeg, 

and three eggs. Mix with three large cups of warm 

milk, and let it rise over night ; if well risen in the 



BREAD. 81 

morning, knead and set in a cool place until three 
o'clock in the afternoon, then shape into long rolls, as 
you do White Mountain rolls, and let them rise one 
hour and a half. Bake half an hour in a moderate oven. 
When done, glaze them with a little milk in which a 
little brown sugar has been dissolved, and set them 
back in the oven for two minutes. These are for tea. 
They are nice, sliced thin, when cold. 

Bunns. 
Bunns are made the same as coffee rolls, with the 
addition of two cups of English currants. They are 
shaped like biscuit, only a little smaller. 

Soda Biscuit. 
Take one quart of flour, before it is sifted, and put 
into the sieve, and with it one teaspoonful of saleratus, 
two of cream of tartar, one of salt, and one tablespoon- 
ful of white sugar. Mix all these thoroughly with the 
flour ; then run through the sieve, and then rub in one 
spoonful of lard or butter. Wet with a little over half 
a pint of milk. Roll on the board about an inch thick ; 
cut with a biscuit cutter, and bake in a quick oven 
fifteen minutes. If you have not milk, use a little more 
butter, and wet with water. Handle as little and 
make as rapidly as possible. 

Cream of Tartar Eolls. 
Take one pint of flour, before it is sifted, put into the 
sieve with one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one half of 



82 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

saleratus, one half of salt, one of sugar, and mix them 
together, then run them through the sieve ; wet with 
half a pint of milk. Heat and grease the French roll 
pan, and put a large spoonful into every compartment ; 
set into a hot oven, and bake fifteen minutes. This 
quantity will make just one roll pan full. 

Sour Milk Biscuit. 
Rub half a spoonful of butter or lard into one quart 
of flour, and wot it with one quart of sour milk, into 
which you have previously stirred one teaspoonful uf 
saleratus, which had been dissolved in a little hot water. 
Use as much more flour as you find necessary to make 
the dough stiff enough to roll out. Roll on the board 
about an inch thick and cut with a biscuit cutter. Bake 
in a quick oven. If you use lard for shoitening, add 
one teaspoonful of salt. 

Buttermilk Eolls. 
Take two coffee cups of buttermilk, and stir into it 
one teaspoonful of saleratus dissolved in a little hot 
water, and stir into this about five cups of flour ; beat 
this up lightly, and bake in French roll pans, the same 
as cream of tartar rolls. These are very nice. This 
will make two roll pans full. 

Graham Eolls. 
Take two coffee cups of sour milk, and stir into it one 
teaspoonful of saleratus, one of salt, half a cup of sugar, 



BREAD. 83 

two eggs, one cup of flour, and Graham enough to make 
a stiff batter. Bake the same as cream of tartar rolls, 
allowing ten minutes longer. 

Graham Kolls, No. 2. 

Take one cup of ice water, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and Graham enough to make a thick batter ; beat this 
lightly, and bake in French roll pans in a quick oven. 
This makes one pan full. 

Corn Eolls. 

Corn rolls are made the same as Graham, using In- 
dian meal instead of Graham. 

Corn Cake. 

Three teacups of Indian meal, one teaspoonful of salt, 
one tablespoonful of sugar, one of butter ; wet this with 
boiling water, and then beat in one egg ; spread half 
an inch deep on buttered tin sheets, and bake brown 
in a quick oven. This is delicious. 

Corn Cake, No. 2. 

Three teacupfuls of Indian meal, one of flour, one 
teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of sugar, and one 
of yeast. Mix this with cold water enough to make a 
thin batter, let it rise over night, and in the morning 
add one teaspoonful of saleratus and one tablespoonful of 
melted butter. Bake in round tin plates in a quick oven. 



84 THE ArrLEPORE COOK BOOK. 

Corn Cake, Uo. 3. 

One pint of new milk, one pint o r Indian meal, one 
pint of flour, half a cup of sugar, three eggs, one tea- 
ppoonful of saleratus, two of cream of tartar, salt. Meas- 
ure the meal and flour after they have been sifted, and 
put into the sieve with the saleratus, cream of tartar, 
sugar, and salt. Mix well together and sift. Break the 
>ggs into the pan in which you intend mixing the corn 
sake, and beat light; then turn in the milk and stir in 
the meal. Bake in tin plates in a quick oven. 

Corn Cake, No. 4. 

One pint of Indian meal, one handful of flour, half a 
cup of rice (measured before it is boiled) boiled soft, 
one quart of new milk, and a spoonful of salt. Boil 
the rice as directed for a vegetable, and drain dry (it 
may be boiled the night previous if you choose), and 
turn it into the milk ; set the milk on in hot water, and 
let it boil, and when boiling, pour it on the meal and 
flour. Beat the eggs well and stir into the mixture. 
Turn it »d inch deep into buttered pans, and bake thir- 
ty-five minUes. This can be made with or without the 
rice. 

Eye Drop Cakes. 

Three well-k«iaten eggs, one pint of new milk, one 
cup of flour, one tes. spoor fil cf salt, one tablespoon ful 
of sugar, and rye encugh ie mAce a stiff batter ; half 



BREAD. 85 

fill earthen cups, put them in an old pan (the one you use 
for baking potatoes), set in the oven, and bake one hour. 



flour Drop Cakes. 

Flour drop cakes are made the same as rye, only do 
not have the batter so thick. 



Plour Drop Cakes, No. 2. 

One pint of new milk, four eggs, two tablespoonfuls 
of sugar, half a cup of butter, and four and a half of 
flour. Beat the eggs to a froth, melt the butter and 
turn upon the eggs with the milk and sugar ; then stir 
in the flour, and bake in earthen cups one hour. 

Graham Drop Cakes. 

Graham drop cakes are made the same as rye, with 
the addition of half a cup of sugar. 

Muffins. 

One quart of milk, one cup of yeast, nine cups of 
flour, butter the size of a walnut, and four eggs. Make 
a batter with the milk, butter, yeast, and flour; beat 
the eggs and stir in ; set in a warm place, and let it 
rise four hours, and then bake in buttered muffin rings, 
or fry on the griddle in rings. 



86 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Muffins, ITo. 2. 

One pint of milk, one cup of sugar, five cups of floui, 
one te spoonful of saleratus, two of cream of tartar, two 
eggs, md butter the size of an egg. Beat the butter 
and sugar together, and then add the eggs well beaten ; 
with this mix the milk, and then beat in the flour in 
which the saleratus* and cream of tartar have been 
mixed. Bake in buttered muffin rings in a quick oven. 

Griddle Cakes. 

Sour Milk or Buttermilk Cakes. 

Two coffee cups of sour milk or buttermilk, one tea- 
spoonful of saleratus dissolved in a little hot water, and 
flour enough to pour. Grease the griddle with a piece 
of fat salt pork, and fry the cakes a light brown. 

Eice Cakes. 

Make with sour milk, as directed above, and add two 
well-beaten eggs, one cup of boiled rice, and one tea- 
spoonful of salt. They require a longer time to fry than 
the plain do, but are very nice. 

Indian Cakes. 

Make as the first, using half flour and half Indian 
meal, and one teaspoonful of salt. These require a 
longer time to fry than when made with all flour. 



BREAD. 87 

Corn Dodgers. 

Take three teacups of Indian meal, one teaspoonful 
of salt, one tablespoonful of sugar, and pour on boiling 
water enough to wet it ; then make into small flat cakes 
about an inch thick, and fry in boiling fat until brown. 
They will fry in fifteen or twenty minutes. To be eaten 
very hot. 

Bread Cakes. 

Take stale bread and soak it in milk ; when soft, run 
it through a cullender. To one quart of this add one 
teaspoonful of saleratus, two eggs, one cup of flour, one 
teaspoonful of salt, two table spoonfuls of sugar, and 
half a nutmeg. These also take some time to cook. 
The eggs may be omitted if you choose, but you must 
then use half a cup more of flour. 

Buckwheat Cakes. 

One pint of warm water, half a cup of yeast, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, half a cup of Indian meal, two table- 
spoonfuls of molasses, and buckwheat enough to make a 
thin batter ; let this rise over night ; in the morning 
sift in one teaspoonful of saleratus, and fry. If you 
have them every morning, save a little of the batter to 
rise them with, instead of using fresh yeast every time. 
The Indian meal may be omitted if you prefer thorn 
without ; in this case use a little more buckwheat. 
They may be made with sour milk, as the flour are 



88 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

made, by substituting buckwheat for flour ; but they are 
not so good as when raised. Buckwheat is so fine that 
care must be taken to stir and beat well from the bot- 
tom, or there will be lumps of dry buckwheat there. 

Fried Mush. 

Into one quart of boiling water stir one tablespoonful 
of salt, and one cup of flour mixed with one quart of 
Indian meal (it may take a little more than a quart of 
meal to make it stiff enough) ; beat it well, or it will 
be lumpy. Boil gently two hours, and then turn into 
dishes which have been dipped in cold wat< r, and set 
away to cool. Pans in which you bake loaves of bread 
are the best to cool it in, as it then makes handsome 
slices. In the morning cut into slices an inch thick, 
and fry brown in pork fat. Serve slices of fried pork 
with it. You can cook enough at one time for several 
breakfasts. If you do not wish to fry the mush, do not 
use the flour, and do not make quite so stiff. 

Brown Bread Brewis. 

If you bake brown bread there will be a great deal 
of hard crust. Take this crust and put in a basin with 
a little salt, and cold water enough to cover it; cover 
tight, and set on the fire to boil ; boil fifteen or twenty 
minutes, and serve in a deep dish. It must be dry and 
soft This is very nice eaten with cold corned beef or 
cold tongue ; it can also be eaten with milk or sirup. 



PLAIN CAKE. 

Tea Cake. 

One spoonful of butter, one cup of sugar, one of 
milk, one teaspoonful of saleratus, two of cream of tar- 
tar, and one pint of flour. Beat the sugar and butter 
together, and then the two eggs ; next stir the milk 
with them, and then stir in the flour in which the sal- 
eratus and cream of tartar have been thoroughly mixed. 
Turn it, about an inch deep, into shallow pans, and 
bake in a quick oven. To be eaten warm. 

Berry Cake. 

Make the same as tea cake, only measure the pint 
of flour before it is sifted, and stir in one pint of blue 
berries. 

Plain Cup Cake. 

Half a cup of butter, one of sugar, three of flour, one 
of milk, three eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, two 
of cream of tartar, and lemon or nutmeg to taste. Beat 
the butter light, then add the sugar gradually, beating 
all the time until it is a cream, and then add the eggs, 
which have been beaten light, and the milk ; mix all 

89 



90 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

these well together, and then stir in the flour, in which 
the saleratus and cream of tartar have been mixed. 
Flavor and bake either in loaves or sheets ; when done, 
the place on top where it has cracked, open will look 
well done. If baked in loaves, it will take forty min- 
utes ; in sheets, twenty. This quantity will make two 
6mall loaves. 

Kicher Cup Cake. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, one of milk, four 
of flour, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, half of sal- 
eratus, four eggs, and a nutmeg. Put together as di- 
rected for plain cup cake. This will make two large 
loaves. Bake in a moderate oven fifty minutes, or more. 

Eailroad Cake. 

One cup of sugar, one half of milk, one and a half 
of flour, two tablespoonfuls of butter, two eggs, one 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar, and one half of saleratus. 
Flavor with lemon, and bake in thin sheets Put to- 
gether as directed for plain cup cake. 

Cream Cake. 

Very nice. Beat to a froth one cup of sugar and 
three eggs, and on this pour one cup of sweet cream; 
then stir in one and a half cups of flour in which one 
teaspoonful of saleratus and two of cream of tartar are 



PLAIN CAKE. . 91 

thoroughly mixed. Flavor with leinon, and pour into 
shallow pans Bake, in a rather quick oven, thirty minutes. 



leather Cake. 

One cup of sugar, one of milk, two scant cups ol 
flour, one egg, one tablespoonful of butter, half a tea 
spoonful of saleratus, one of cream of tartar, and flavor 
to taste. Soften (but do not melt) the butter, and beat 
it with the sugar and egg ; then add the milk, and then 
the flour mixed with the saleratus and cream of tartar. 
Bake in shallow pans in a quick oven. 



Sponge Cake. 

Three eggs, one and a half cups of sugar, two of 
flour, one half of cold water, one teaspoonful of cream 
of tartar, one half of saleratus. Beat the sugar and eggs 
together, and add the water when they are light, then 
the flour, in which mix the saleratus and cream of tar- 
tar. Flavor with lemon, and bake in a quick oven. 

Sponge Cake, Wo, 2. 

One cup of sugar, three eggs, one cup of flour, one 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar, and half of saleratus. 
Beat sugar and eggs together, and then beat in the 
flour in which the saleratus is mixed. Flavor with 
lemon, and bake in sheets in a quick oven. 



92 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Allie's Cake. 

One cup of molasses, one of sugar, one of sour milk, 
three of flour, one half of butter, one pound of raisins, 
one teaspoonful of saleratus, two of cinnamon, and one 
of cloves. Beat sugar and butter together, then add 
molasses and spice, then the sour milk in which the sal- 
eratus is dissolved, and then the flour, and last the rai- 
sins. Bake in loaves in a moderate oven. If the raisins 
. are not stoned, chop them. It is much better, however, 
to stone them. 

Eaisin Cake. 

One cup of molasses, one of butter, one of milk, three 
of flour, two of chopped raisins, and one teaspoonful of 
saleratus. Spice to your taste. Soften the butter and 
beat it and the molasses together; then add milk, and 
then the flour in which the saleratus is mixed, and 
lastly the raisins. Bake in loaves in a moderate oven. 

Apple Cake. 

Wash clean two cups of sliced dried apple, and soak 
over night ; in the morning chop one half of them, and 
stew them all slowly in 'two cups of molasses, until 
they are dark. One cup of butter, two of sugar, two 
of chopped raisins, two thirds of sour milk, four eggs, 
two teaspoonfuls of saleratus, five cups of flour, and all 
kinds of spice. Put together as directed for raisin cake, 
and stir in the apple and raisins last. Bake in loaves, 
in a moderate oven, from two hours and a half to three. 



PLAIN CAKE. 93 

Bich Molasses Gingerbread. 

Two cups of molasses, two of milk, one of melted 
butter, two and a half teaspoonfuls of saleratus, three 
eggs, one tablespoonful of ginger, and one nutmeg, one 
cup of sugar, and eight cups of flour. Beat molasses, 
butter, -sugar, and eggs together ; then dissolve the sal- 
eratus in the milk, and add it with flour, ginger, and 
nutmeg; beat up well, and pour about two inches deep 
into pans, and bake half an hour. This will keep well, 
but being nearly as expensive as cup cake, I would 
rather make it plainer and oftener. 

Soft Molasses Gingerbread, No. 2. 

One cup of molasses, one teaspoonful of saleratus, one 
of ginger, one tablespoonful of butter or lard, a pinch 
of salt, if you use lard. Stir this together, and then 
pour on one half a cup of boiling water, one pint of 
flour. Bake about one inch deep in a sheet. This is 
very nice if pains are taken to have the water boiling, 
and to beat it well when the flour is added. 

Soft Molasses Gingerbread, No. 3. 

One cup of molasses, one of sugar, one of sour milk, 
one tablespoonful of ginger, half of saleratus, one egg, 
and flour enough to make a thick batter. Bake about 
one inch deep in a tin sheet 



94 THE APPIJEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Hard Molasses Gingerbread. 

One pint of molasses, half a cup of lard or butter, 
i lalf a tablespoonful of salt when you use lard), one 
tablespoonful of ginger, one of saleratus ; beat all this 
together, and when well mixed add half a pint of cola 
water, and flour enough to roll. Roll this very thin 
and cut in strips about three inches wide and six long, 
with a jagging-iron, and bake in a quick oven until 
brown. When you take them from the oven, lay them 
on a sieve to cool, and when cold, put them in a tin 
box that can be covered tight ; keep this in a dry 
closet, and they will keep nice and crispy for a month. 

Hard Sugar Gingerbread. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, one of sour milk, 
two eggs, one tablespoonful of ginger, one teaspoonful of 
saleratus, and flour enough to roll. Beat the sugar and 
butter to a cream, then beat in the eggs, ; add the ginger 
and sour milk in which the saleratus is dissolved, and then 
the flour. Roll about half an inch thick ; cut, bake, and 
keep the same as directed for hard molasses gingerbread. 

Ginger Snaps. 

One cup of molasses, one of butter, one of sugar, one 
tablespoonful of ginger, and two eggs. Put the molas- 
ses and butter in a tin pan, and set one the fire ; when 
it boils up, take off, and add the sugar and ginger. 



PLAIN CAKE. 95 

When they are well mixed, add the eggs, which have 
been well beaten, and then flour enough to roll. Put 
a ?mall piece at a time on the board, and roll as thin as 
the blade of a knife ; cut into round cakes, and bake in 
a quick oven until they are a dark brown. Cool, and 
keep in a tin box, the same as hard gingerbread. 

Molasses Cookies. 

One cup of molasses, one of brown sugar, one of 
lard, one half of boiling water, one spoonful of ginger, 
one of saleratus, one of salt, and flour enough to roll. 
Beat sugar, lard, molasses, saleratus, and ginger to- 
gether ; then pour on the boiling water, and mix in the 
flour. Roll about three quarters of an inch thick, and 
cut with a round cutter. Bake in a quick oven. 

Vinegar Cookies. 

Two cups of molasses, one of butter or lard, two eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one of ginger, one of sal- 
eratus, and flour enough to roll. Roll about half an inch 
thick, cut into round cakes, and bake in a quick oven. 

Sugar Cookies. 

One cup of sugar, half a cup of butter, one cup of 
milk, two eggs, half a nutmeg, one teaspoonful saleratus, 
and flour enough to roll. Beat sugar and butter to a 
cream, then add the eggs, well beaten, dissolve the sal- 
eratus in the milk, and stir that in, then the flour. 



96 THE appledOre cook book. 

Jumbles. 
Three cups of sugar, two of butter, three eggs, one 
teaspoonful of saleratus, four tablespoonfuls of sour 
cream, and flour enough to roll. Beat sugar and butter 
to a cream, then add the eggs, which are well beaten, 
then the sour cream in which the saleratus is dissolved. 
Flavor with anything you please. Cut with an oval 
cutter. If you have a cutter that takes a piece out of 
the centre, use that. When you roll them, sift over 
the dough, before you cut it, granulated sugar, and then 
roll the pin lightly over it. This is a much better way 
than to sift the sugar on after the cakes are put in the 
pan, for when sifted in the pan it burns on it, and 
spoils the looks of the pan and cakes. Great care must 
be taken in baking all kinds of cakes which you roll 
on the board, as they burn very quickly ; and again, 
if they are not baked enough, they will not .be nice, 
keep well, or be healthful. Where there are children, 
this is the most economical way to make cake, but 
takes more time ; and also in families where they do 
not care for cake, they are nice to keep in case of un- 
expected company. 

Plain Doughnuts. 
One pint of flour, half a cup of sugar, one spoonful 
of butter, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one half 
of saleratus, half a nutmeg, and milk enough to wet 
and roll. Soften the butter and mix with the milk (about 
one cupful) ; mix the sugar, saleratus, cream of tartar, 



PLAIN CAKE. 97 

and the nutmeg with the flour, and stir into the butter 
and milk. After beating well with the spoon, put on 
the board, roll about an inch thick, and cut in any 
shape you please. Have ready boiling lard or drippings, 
and fry until done, which will be in about eight minutes. 
The addition of two eggs is an improvement, but not 
necessary. When you have finished frying, cut a pota- 
to in slices and put in the fat to clarify it, then set 
the kettle one side until it settles, then strain into an 
earthen pot (keep one on purpose for this), and set in 
a cool place. The sediments which remain in the bot- 
tom put in the soap-grease. Many persons fry dough- 
nuts in the common frying-pan, but there is not depth 
enough to it. It is much better, if you have not an 
iron kettle that is deep enough, to use a tin basin. 

Eaised Doughnuts. 

One cup of sweet milk, one spoonful of butter, four 
of yeast, four of sugar, half a nutmeg, and flour to 
make a stiff batter ; let this rise over night. In the 
morning roll out, cut in strips, with a jagging-iron, about 
four inches long and two wide, and fry. Common 
raised dough makes very nice ones to be eaten as soon as 
fried, either for breakfast or tea. 

Doughnuts should not be eaten before November or 
after April ; indeed, they are not very healthful to eat 
at any time. Keep covered in a stone pot in the cellar. 



PUDDINGS. 

i 

Boiled Eice, 

Pick and wash clean one cupful of rice, and put into 
a basin with a pint and a half of cold water ; set on the 
stove where it will cook slowly ; or, better still, set into 
another basin of water, and cook slowly. When the rice 
has absorbed all the water, turn on it one quart of new 
milk, and stir in one tablespoonful of salt ; let this cook 
two hours, stirring often. Serve with sugar and cream 

Boiled Eice, No. 2. 

Pick and wash one cup of rice, and boil in one quart of 
boiling water fifteen minutes, and then drain dry. Wring 
a pudding-cloth out of boiling water, and spread in a 
deep dish, and turn the rice into it, and sprinkle in one 
cup of raisins and a tablespoonful of salt ; tie the cloth 
loosely that the rice may have room to swell, and boil 
two hours Serve with lemon sauce, or sugar and cream. 

Baked Eice. 

Boil half a cup of rice in one pint of water thirty min- 
utes, and then add one quart of new milk, and boil thirty 
98 



PUDDINGS. 99 

minutes longer ; then beat together one cup of sugar, 
three eggs, two teaspoonfuls of salt, and a little lemon 
or nutmeg ; stir this into the rice and turn the mixture 
into a buttered pudding-dish, and bake thirty minutes. 
To be eaten without sauce. 

Baked Eice, Ho. 2. 

Pick and wash one cup of rice ; put it in a dish that 
will hold two quarts and a pint, and cover with fresh 
milk ; stir into this two teaspoonfuls of salt, one table- 
spoonful of cinnamon, and four of sugar. Set this in 
the oven, and stir once in every half hour ; after it has 
been baking two hours stir in milk enough to fill the 
dish, and bake one hour longer (the dish should be 
nearly full of milk at first). Serve with sugar and milk. 

Minute Pudding. 

One pint of milk, one of water, nine tablespoonfuls of 
flour, one teaspoonful of salt, two eggs. Set the milk 
into a basin of hot water, and when it comes to a boil 
add to it one pint of boiling water. Ilave ready the flour, 
made into a smooth paste with one cup of milk, and mix 
with this paste, after they are well beaten, the two eggs ; 
now take the basin in which the milk and water are, 
and set upon the fire ; let it boil up once, and then stir 
in the thickening ; beat it well, that it may be smooth, 
and cook three minutes longer. Serve with vinegar 
6auce. 



100 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Corn Starch Pudding. 

One quart of milk, six tablespoonfuls of corn starch, 
three eggs, one teaspoonful of salt Put the milk in a 
basin, and set the basin into a kettle with boiling water, 
and when it comes to a boil stir in the corn starch and 
eggs, which prepare in the following manner : Wet the 
corn starch with one cup of cold milk, and then stir into 
it the eggs which are well beaten. After the starch is 
added to the boiling milk it will cook in three minutes : 
beat well to make smooth. Serve with sugar and cream 
or wine sauce. Never add the eggs after the starch 
has been stirred into the boiling milk ; if you do the 
egg will be in spots in it. 

Quaking Pudding. 

Take as much stale bread as will fill a quart basin after 
it is cut ; now butter well a tin mould or pail that will 
cover tight, and put in a layer of bread ; then strew in a 
few raisins, and then bread, and so on until the bread is 
all used (the bread must be cut very thin). Make a cus- 
tard of three pints of milk and six eggs, and season with 
salt and nutmeg ; turn this on the bread, and set away 
in a cool place two hours, and then set in a steamer and 
steam three. Serve with wine sauce. This may be 
boiled in a pudding-cloth. When boiled, prepare the 
same as for steaming, omitting the buttering of the dish, 
and let it soak two hours and a half, then turn into the 
pudding-cloth, tie tight, and boil two hours and a half. 



PUDDINGS. 101 

Bride's Pudding. 

Make the same as plain corn starch pudding, using the 
yolks of six eggs. Butter a pudding-dish, and turn the 
pudding into it (do not fill within three inches of the top 
of the dish), and bake thirty minutes ; then take from the 
oven, and let it stand in a cool place twenty minutes ; 
then cover with a meringue. Set in the oven ten minutes, 
and serve with cold sauce. To make the meringue, beat 
the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and then beat into 
them gradually one cup of sugar. This pudding is quite 
nice made with four eggs, but will not look so handsome 

Bread Pudding. 

Take a quart basinful of stale bread, and soak in twr 
quarts of sweet milk two hours (keep in a cool place, 
while soaking) ; then mash well with a spoon, and take 
out all the hard pieces. Bent light four eggs and stir into 
this, then add two teaspoonfuls of salt, a little nutmeg, 
and one fourth of a cup of sugar, if you serve it with 
sauce ; if not, one and a half cupfuls. Bake three quar- 
ters of an hour, and serve with lemon sauce. Some put 
raisins in, but it must be much stiffer if you have them, 
and the delicacy of the pudding is thereby lost. 

Whortleberry Pudding. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, one of sour milk, four 
of flour, five eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, and one 



102 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

quart of berries Beat the sugar and butter to a cream 
and add the eggs well beaten ; then the sour milk, in 
which the saleratus is dissolved, and then the flour, 
and lastly the berries. Wring the pudding-cloth out 
of boiling water and spread it in a deep dish ; then 
turn the batter in and tie. Have ready a kettle of 
boiling water, and drop the pudding into it ; turn the 
pudding often, and boil three hours. Serve with vine- 
gar or wine sauce. This can be steamed also. Allow 
half an hour longer to cook, when steamed. 

Plain Whortleberry Pudding. 

One pint of flour, one egg, half a pint of sweet milk, 
one teaspoonful of cream tartar, half of saleratus, and a 
quart of berries. Beat the egg to a froth and mix with 
the milk ; then stir in the flour, in which the saleratus 
and cream tartar are thoroughly mixed ; then the berries. 
Boil and serve as directed above. 

Boiled Apple Pudding. 

Pare, boil, and mash six good-sized mealy potatoes, and 
turn on them half a pint of boiling milk, then stir in a 
teaspoonful of salt and a tablespoonful of butter ; set in a 
cool place, and stir until about blood warm ; then stir in 
flour enough to roll, and roil about an inch thick. Have 
a two-quart basinful of apples, which are pared, cored, 
and quartered ; spread these on the paste and grate a lit- 
tle nutmeg over them ; then roll up the paste, and boil as 



PUDDINGS. 103 

directed for berry pudding, and serve with either maple 
sirup, wine, or vinegar sauce. This can be steamed, 
allowing four hours for it to cook. 

Boiled Batter Pudding. 

Take one cup of flour, and add to it gradually one 
quart of sweet milk ; then stir in one teaspoonful of 
salt and six well-beaten eggs. Turn this into the pud- 
ding-cloth, and tie tight, leaving room for it to swell 
one third. Boil two hours. Serve with wine sauce. 
Great care must be taken in boiling puddings to have 
the water boiling when you put the pudding in, and to 
keep it boiling all the time. Steaming is the safer way, 
and I would always steam rather than boil, if I had the 
convenience. When boiling, always keep a kettle of 
boiling water to fill up, as it boils away from the pud- 
ding For a pudding-cloth get three quarters of a yard 
of drilling. Keep an old saucer to put in the bottom of 
the kettle, in which you boil the pudding, to prevent its 
being burned. When you are ready to dish the pudding, 
have a pan of cold water, into which plunge it imme- 
diately upon taking it from the kettle (but do not let 
it stand in cold water one second) ; then put it in a 
deep dish, and untie the string; open the cloth and 
turn the pudding-dish on it ; then lift the pudding up 
by means of the cloth, and turn over. You will thus 
preserve the shape of the pudding. Batter puddings 
are very difficult to make, and I would not advise a 
young cook .to try them at first. 



104 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Baked Apple Pudding. 

Make a paste as directed for plain pie-crust, and line 
a dish with it, and fill the dish with sliced apples. To a 
dish holding three quarts, allow one cup of sugar, one 
half of molasses, one of water, one nutmeg, and half a 
teaspoon of cinnamon ; cover this with the paste, and 
bake slowly three hours. Serve with sugar and cream, 
or with cold sauce. 

Pan Dowdy. 

Pare and slice tart apples enough to fill, about two 
inches deep, a flat earthen or tin pan. To three quarts 
of apple add one cup of sugar, one grated nutmeg, one 
cup of cold water, and butter the size of a walnut. 
Cover this with plain pie-crust (have the crust about an 
inch thick), and bake slowly two hours and a half; 
then cover and set where it will keep hot one hour. 
Serve with sugar and cream. When done the apple 
will look red. Do not break the crust into the apple 
after baking, as by this means you spoil the pastry. If 
you wish to have it richer, cover with puff paste. 

Apple Dowdy. 

Pare and quarter about one dozen good tart apples, put 
them in a kettle with one cup of molasses, a small piece 
of butter, and one pint of hot water. Set this on the fire, 
and let it come to a boil, and while it is heating make a

paste with one pint of flour, one teaspoon of cream tar- 
tar, one half of saleratus, and a little milk ; roll this 
large enough to fit into the kettle, and when the mix- 
ture begins to boil, put the paste in, cover tight, and 
boil gently twenty minutes. To be eaten without sauce. 
This is very nice when the apples are tart and it is made 
well 

Apple Charlotte. 

Butter a brown earthen dish, and place around the sides 
slices of bread which have been cut about an inch thick, 
soaked in cold water, and buttered ; fill the dish with 
sliced apples, and grate over them one nutmeg ; strew on 
one cup of sugar, and then pour on one cup of water ; 
this will carry the sugar through the apple. Cover the 
apple with slices of soaked and buttered bread, then 
cover the whole with a large plate, and bake in a very 
moderate oven four hours. Remove from the oven half 
an hour before time to dish, and set where it will be 
cooling. When ready to dish, loosen gently round the 
edges with a knife, lay the dish in which you intend 
serving it on the one in which it was baked, turn the 
dishes over, and lift the pudding-dish off. This is a very 
handsome dish. Serve with sugar and cream or plain. 

Apple and Sago Pudding. 

Wash half a cup of sago, and set on the fire with 
three pints of cold water ; simmer two hours ; then stir 
in one cup of white sugar, one teaspoon ful of salt, and 



106 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

one of the extract of lemon. Have ready a deep pud- 
ding-dish, in which, after it has been well buttered, 
put as many pared and cored apples as will stand in the 
dish ; turn over them the sago, and bake one hour in a 
moderate oven. Serve with sugar and cream. 

Tapioca and Apple Pudding. 

Prepare the tapioca as directed for sago. Pare and 
quarter ten tart apples, and when the tapioca is cooked 
stir them into it, turn them into a buttered padding-dish, 
and bake one hour and a quarter. Remove the pudding 
from the oven half an hour before it is served, or it will 
be thin. Serve with sugar and cream. 

Boiled Tapioca Pudding. 

Wash one cup of tapioca, and soak it one hour in one 
pint of cold water, then stir in one quart of milk and two 
teaspoonfuls of salt ; set the basin into another of hot 
water, and set on the fire ; cook one hour and a half. 
Serve with sugar and cream. 

Baked Tapioca Pudding. 

Prepare the tapioca as before directed, allowing one 
pint more of milk for the same quantity of tapioca. 
Beat together one cup of sugar and four eggs ; stir this 
into the tapioca, and flavor wH-h lemon or nutmeg. Bake 
in a buttered dish half an hour. Serve without sauce, 
or omit the sugar and serve with wine sauce. 



PUDDINGS. 107 

Custard Pudding. 

Beat together three tablespoonfuls of sugar and four 
eggs ; stir this into one quart of milk, with one tea- 
spoonful of salt ; flavor with nutmeg or lemon. Bake 
until firm in the centre ; this you tell by inserting the 
handle of a teaspoon. Do not let the oven get hot 
enough to boil it. 

Baked Indian Pudding. 

Three tablespoonfuls of Indian meal, one cup of mo- 
lasses, two quarts of milk, two eggs, butter half the 
size of an egg, one tablespoonful of ginger, two teaspoon- 
fuls of salt ; boil one quart of the milk, and pour it 
boiling on the meal, then turn in the molasses, and 
next the cold milk, butter, ginger, salt, and eggs. 
Bake five hours in a moderate oven. Serve with cream. 
The eggs and ginger may be omitted if you choose. 



Cottage Pudding. 

One spoonful of butter, one cup of sugar, one cup 
of milk, one pint of flour, two eggs, one teaspoonful of 
saleratus, two of cream of tartar. Soften the butter, 
and then beat to a froth with the sugar and eggs ; then 
add the milk, and lastly the flour, in which the saleratus 
and cream of tartar are thoroughly mixed. Flavor with 
lemon, and bake in two shallow pudding-dishes half an 



108 THE AFPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

hour, in a moderate oven. Serve with lemon sauce. 
The pudding is improved by sifting sugar over it, before 
baking. 

Sponge Pudding. 

Beat to a froth three eggs and one cup of sugar ; stir 
into this half a cup of cold water, and then two cups of 
flour in which are mixed one teaspoonful of saleratus and 
two of cream of tartar. Flavor with lemon, and bake in 
two shallow dishes. When baked frost with frosting No. 
2, and let it stand in a warm place ten minutes, then send 
to the table with lemon sauce. Bake twenty-five minutes. 

Italian Fritters. 

Cut stale bread into slices an inch thick, and soak 
them in a custard made with two eggs and a pint of 
milk ; then fry a light brown in boiling lard (have as 
much lard in the pan as you would for doughnuts), and 
serve with either wine sauce No. 2 or cider sauce. Have 
the dishes very hot. 

I have here given rules for twenty-three plain pud- 
dings, and if anything richer is desired, it will be found 
in Part Second. 



PIES. 

Plain Pie Crust, 

Into one quart of flour rub a large spoonf t of salt 
and half a cup of lard, and then wet with ice-water 
enough to make a soft paste ; roll this on th( board un- 
til it is about half an inch thick, then spread on half a 
cup of washed butter, dredge with flour, and fold into 
a 6mall square. Pound lightly with the rolling-pin, then 
roll out again ; roll it up, and set on the ice to harden ; 
it will be ready to use in two hours. In w:'uter it can 
be used immediately. To make the bottom crust, rub 
three quarters of a cup of lard into one qu&rt of flour 
and one spoonful of salt, and wet with cold water, to 
make a soft paste. Do not roll, as it makes it tough 
Butter is more healthful than lard ; therefore, if you can 
afford it, use it. 

Cream Paste. 

To one quart of flour add one spoonful of salt, and 
mix to a soft paste with sweet cream ; roll thin and 
spread with cream and dredge with flour, fold and roll 
again ; repeat this operation three times, then make the 
pies. Pies made with this paste taste nice, and are not 

109 



110 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOCK. 

hurtful, but do not look so handsome as when made 
with butter and lard. Look in Part, Second for minute 
direction for making paste. 

Sliced Apple Pies. 

Line the plates with bottom crust, and fill the plate 
with quartered apples. To a common-sized plate allow 
two spoonfuls of sugar, a little nutmeg, and two spoon- 
fuls of water. Cut the upper crust a little larger than 
the plate, and raise the under crust with the blade of 
the knife, and lay it under it. Bake in a moderate oven 
one hour. When molasses is preferred, use three spoon- 
fuls, and a little cinnamon instead of nutmeg. 

Stewed Apple Pies. 

Pare, core, and stew the apples with just water enough 
to prevent their burning. To a quart of stewed apple 
allow one cup of sugar. Bottom the plates and roll a 
piece of the top crust out (making it long enough to go 
around the plate), cut into strips an inch wide, and lay 
around the plate, then put in the apple (Do not make 
the pie too thick.) Grate over it a little nutmeg, cover, 
and bake in a rather quick oven forty minutes. 

Dried Apple Pies. 

Cook the apple according to the directions given in 
Part Second, under Dried Apple, and make the same as 
stewed apple pie. 



PIES. Ill 

Berry Pies, 

Line the plates, and fill as full as you can with berries, 
and dredge on about half a spoonful of flour, and two 
spoonfuls of sugar, and two of water ; cover as directed 
for sliced apple pies, and bake forty minutes in a moder- 
ate oven. All berry pies are made in this manner, if 
they are very sour using more sugar. Cherries and cur- 
rants do not require any water, but more sugar, and 
they must not be heaped in the plate as blueberries, 
blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries are. 

Emibarb Pies. 

Cut the rhubarb in the morning, or if you buy it, al- 
ways keep in a cool place until ready to cook it. Strip 
off the skin and cut it into pieces about an inch long ; 
stew in just water enough to prevent its burning ; when 
cold, sweeten to taste. Cover the pie-plates, and roll the 
upper crust about half an inch thick ; cut into strips an 
inch wide, and after filling the plate with the rhubarb, 
put on four cross-pieces and the rim. Bake half an houi. 

Squash Pies. 

Pare, boil, and sift a good dry squash. To one quart 
of the squash pour on two of boiling milk, and then stir 
in two cups of sugar, two spoonfuls of salt, one of cinna- 
mon, one grated nutmeg, and five well-beaten eggs. Line 
deep plates with plain paste, fill with the mixture, and 



112 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

bake one hour in a moderate oven. The pies look nice 
to boil a stick of cinnamon in the milk, instead of using 
the ground. 

Cranberry Pies. 

Stew the cranberries according to directions in Part 
Second, and make the same as rhubarb pies. 



C-ooseberry Pies. 

Stew the gooseberries in as little water as possible, 
sweeten to taste, and make the same as rhubarb pies. 



Pumpkin Pies. 

Pare and cut the pumpkin into small pieces ; wash and 
put into the kettle with one quart of water ; boil six hours, 
stirring often to prevent burning ; then run it through a 
sieve. Make the same as squash, adding a teaspoonful of 
ginger. They may be made without eggs by using five 
pounded crackers. Cook enough of the pumpkin at a 
time to last two weeks ; after you have kept it one week, 
set in the oven and scald, then set away in a cool place. 

Custard Pies. 

Line a deep plate with paste ; make the custard the 
same as for custard pudding ; fill the plate, and bake 
until firm in the centre. 



PIES. 113 

Mince Pies. 

Boil a shank of beef six hours ; then take up and set 
away to cool. (Save the liquor for soup.) When cold, 
free from bones and cut off all the fat and gristle ; then 
chop fine. To one quart of the chopped meat add three 
of chopped apple, one pint of chopped suet, one quart 
of chopped raisins, one quart of sugar, one of molasses, 
half a cup of cinnamon, one quarter of a cup of cloves, 
one quarter of a cup of allspice, one quarter of a cup of 
ground mace, six grated nutmegs, half a cup of salt. 
Mix this thoroughly with the hands, then turn on the 
mixture three quarts of good cider, and let the mixture 
stand over night. In the morning scald, in a porcelain 
kettle, one hour ; then put in stone pots ; cover tight 
and keep in a cool, dry place. This will keep three 
months. To tell the exact amount of spice and sweet- 
ening is almost impossible, as tastes vary ; but with a 
little judgment, and the rule I have given, I think there 
cannot be any very serious trouble. Prepare the paste and 
plates as for stewed apple pies, and put in the meat ; 
then grate a little nutmeg over it, and strew a few whole 
raisins in ; cover and bake one hour in a moderate oven. 

Mock Mince Pies. 

Two pounded crackers, one cup of molasses, one of 
cider, one of chopped raisins, two eggs, one teaspoonful 
of salt, one of clove, two of cinnamon, one of mace, one 
nutmeg. Bake forty minutes. This quantity makes two 
pies. 



114 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Lemon Pies. 

Soak a pounded cracker in one pint of new milk ; stir 
in to this the yolks of three and the whites of two 
eggs, which have been beaten with half a cup of sugar 
and the rind and juice of one lemon Bake in a deep 
plate, which has been lined with plain paste, half an 
hour. When cooked, beat the white of one egg to a 
froth, and stir in one spoonful of sugar; set in the oven 
until a light brown. 

Oream Pies. 

Three eggs beaten with one and a half cups of sugar, 
half a cup of cold water, two cups of flour in which 
are mixed one half teaspoonful of saleratus, one of 
cream of tartar. Flavor with lemon. Bake in deep 
tin plates such as you use for squash-pies, and when 
cool split with a sharp knife, and fill. This will make 
four pies. 

Pilling for Oream Pies. 

One pint of new milk, one cup of sugar, half a cup 
of flour, two eggs. Put the basin, in which the milk is, 
into another of hot water. Beat the sugar, flour, and 
eggs together until they are light and smooth, and when 
the milk boils, stir in with one teaspoonful of salt. 
Cook twenty minutes, stirring often. Flavor with lemon. 
This will fill four pies. 



PIES. 115 

Washington Pies. 

Make the outside the same as for cream pies, and 
fill with any kind of jelly or jam you choose. For 
richer pies look in Part Second. 

Eemarks. 

Always measure flour after it has been sifted, unless 
told to measure before. Always sift Indian and rye 
meal, and never sift Graham or oat meal. Always set 
milk into boiling- water to boil, as it boils quicker in 
this way, and there will be no danger of burning. Save 
all the fat from soups, boiled and roast meats. The fat 
from beef, pork, and poultry, keep for shortening or 
frying; and from ham, mutton, and soups, in which 
vegetable were boiled, for the soap grease. To clarify 
drippings, boil them a few minutes, and then cut in a 
raw potato, and let it cook for five minutes, then drop 
in a pinch of saleratus, and strain. If all the drippings 
are taken care of, it will be a great saving in a family. 
In many of the rules given here it has been very difficult 
to say just how much spice to use, as there is such a 
difference in tastes, so that each one must use her own 
judgment; but be careful that one spice predominates. 
Always use twice as much cinnamon and nutmeg as you 
do clove. In making frosting, pudding sauce, and all 
kinds of delicate cake, use the powdered sugar, if pos- 
sible. For rich cake, the coffee-crushed, powdered and 
sifted, is the best. For dark cake, the brown sugar will t>e 



1J6 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

found the nicest. It makes it richer. Save all tlu pieces 
of bread for dressing, puddings, and griddle cakes. Tin 
is not very good to mix cake in, and earthen dishes 
are always being broken. The stone china wash bowls 
are very good for this purpose. You can often find odd 
ones at the crockery stores, and they will last a lifetime 
for this purpose. In baking and frying cook everything 
brown. Bread and pastry are more healthful over-done, 
than under-done. 

One even quart of sifted flour is one pound, one pint 
of granulated sugar is one pound, two good-sized cups 
of butter are one pound. Do not buy large quantities 
of Indian and rye meal at a time, as they sour quickly. 
Keep all kinds of meal, flour, and meats in a cool, dry 
place. Keep tea, coffee, and extracts from the air. 
Never set anything into the ice-chest while warm, as 
it will heat the chest and absorb an unpleasant flavor 
from the chest. This is true of the cellar also. Keep 
a note-book for tried receipts, and for any changes 
which you wish to make in the receipts which you are 
constantly using. By thought and observation one can 
learn something new in regard to cooking every day, 
and at the time it will seem so important that you can- 
not forget it ; but you will if you do not have it written. 

In the miscellaneous receipts will be found some very 
nice ones for the family table. They are receipts which 
I forgot, or did not receive until after the book was all 
written and classified. But they were too valuable to be 
left out, and I therefore put them in under this heading. 



THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

PART SECOND. 



SOUPS. 

Soup Stock. 

If you buy fresh meat for a soup stock, the shank is 
the most economical. Have it cut into several pieces, 
and the bone cracked, at the butcher's. Wash and put 
on to boil in two gallons of cold water, and one spoon- 
ful of salt (the salt helps the scum to rise). When it 
comes to a boil, take off the scum and set the kettle 
where the soup will just simmer for ten hours. Then 
strain into a nice tin, which is kept for this purpose, 
or a stone pot ; set where it will be cold, and in the 
morning skim off all the fat, then turn gently into the 
soup-kettle, being careful not to turn in the sediment. 
It is now ready to make any kind of soup. If you 
wish to have a jelly in the morning, boil it in six quarta 
of water. You can then, after taking off the fat, turn 
the jelly over, and scrape off the sediment. Use the 
meat for hash. Another way to make soup stock, is to 

117 



118 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

cover the bones of roast meats with cold water and treat 
in the same manner. This should always be done in 
boarding-houses and hotels ; but in private families (un- 
less very large), there is not meat enough consumed to 
do this. When making a stock, however, if there are 
any cold meat bones, they should be used. Professor 
Blot does not recommend boiling; but I have been 
more successful in obtaining clear soup in this manner 
than when I did not let it boil. I would always boil 
my stock the day before it is to be used, as by this 
means only can fat be avoided, unless you buy all lean 
beef, which is very expensive. Do not boil vegetables 
with the stock, as they cause it to sour quickly. 

Brown Soup. 

Crack the bone of a shank of beef ; take out the mar- 
row and lay in the bottom of the soup-kettle ; cut the 
meat from the bones and lay it in the kettle, set the ket- 
tle on the fire and brown the meat on all sides, being care- 
ful not to burn it. When well browned, put in the bones 
and two quarts of cold water, cover tight, and let it 
simmer one hour ; then put in a stick of cinnamon, eight 
whole cloves, a few pieces of mace, one onion, one car- 
rot, half a turnip and six quarts of water. Boil this six 
hours very gently, strain and set away. In the morning 
skim off the fat and turn the soup into the kettle ; let it 
come to a boil ; season to taste with pepper and salt ; 
cut in thin slices one fresh lemon and put into the soup, 



soups. 119 

and then turn into the tureen. Send to table toasted 
bread, cut into small squares, in a separate dish. Some 
think that half a wine-glass of brandy is an improvement. 

Brown Soup, No, 2, 

Lay the bones from a roast of beef and a roast of 
mutton in the soup-kettle. Cut up one onion, one small 
turnip, one carrot, one parsnip, and lay in the kettle ; 
then a blade of mace, a stick of cinnamon, ten whole 
cloves, a sprig of parsley, a sprig of sage, if you have 
them green, if not, a teaspoonful of each ; now dredge 
in a cup of flour, a tablespoonful of salt, half of pepper; 
then pour on eight quarts of cold water, and boil five 
hours (skim carefully when it first boils); then strain 
through a sieve, and put back into the kettle with one 
cup of sago, and boil one hour and a half. Serve with 
toasted bread. Any kind of bones will make this, but 
beef is the best. 

Brown Soup, No. 3. 

Take two quarts of stock and boil with one onion, 
one carrot, one turnip, six whole cloves, one blade of 
mace, one stick of cinnamon, for one hour ; then strain 
into the tureen, and serve with toasted bread. 

Vegetable Soup. 

Cut into strips two inches long and one fourth of an 
inch wide, two carrots, two parsnips, one turnip, and 



120 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

a very small piece of cabbage. Cover these with water 
and boil one hour ; then strain them and put in the 
soup-kettle with three quarts of stock ; let this boil up 
once. Season with pepper and salt, and serve. 



Julienne Soup. 

This is made the same as vegetable soup, putting in 
every kind of a green vegetable. It is made in June, 
July, and the first of August. The stock should be 
very clear. (Omit beets.) 

Barley Soup. 

Wash half a cup of pearl barley, and boil it slowly 
in one quart of water three hours ; then turn into the 
soup kettle, with three quarts of stock ; let this boil 
up and season with pepper and salt. Serve. 

Sago Soup. 

Make the same as barley, using sago. Two hours 
will cook it. 

Macaroni Soup. 
Made in the same way. 

Vermicelli Soup. 
Made in the same way. 



soups. 121 

Ox-Tail Soup. 

Separate at the joints two ox-tails, put them on to boil 
with one onion, one carrot (have them whole), a few 
cloves, a blade of mace, and a stick of cinnamon. Boil 
two hours ; then strain the liquor, into the soup-kettle, 
separate the tails from the vegetables, and spice, and 
put them into the kettle ; to this add two quarts of 
stock ; season with pepper and salt ; boil up once, and 
serve. 

Tomato Soup. 

Peel and slice tomatoes enough to fill a two-quart ba- 
sin ; put them into the soup-kettle with 6ix quarts of

following morning skim of all the fat ; cut all the meat 
from the part of the turkey which has been left from 
the dinner of the day previous. Put the bones and liquor 
on to boil with one onion, two parsnips, one small tur- 
nip.- Boil three hours; then strain, and put back with 
half a cup of tapioca, and some pieces of the cold tur- 
key. Season with pepper and salt. Boil two hours 
longer, stirring often to prevent the tapioca from burning. 

Chicken Soup. 

Set the liquor, in wliich two or three fowls have been 
boiled, away to cool. Skim off the fat, and then put it 
into the soup-kettle with one whole onion and half a 
cup of rice ; boil two hours. Just before dishing take 
out the onion, and put in some pieces of cold chicken. 

White Soup. 

Take any part of veal (the shin is the best), and al- 
low one quart of cold water to one pound of veal, and 
to eight pounds allow one onion, three parsnips, one 
turnip, a stick of cinnamon, and a blade of mace. Boil 
five hours, and season with salt and white pepper, 
when it has boiled four hours, thicken with two cups 
of flour. Boil one hour longer ; strain, and serve.

cup of flour, and boil one hour longer, then stir in some 
of the beef cut into small pieces, and serve. 

N. B. Use celery in all kinds of soup when you can 
obtain it. 



Mock Turtle Soup. 

Take the brains from a calf s head, and put them in 
a bowl of cold water ; wash the head, and let it stand 
in a pan of cold water two hours ; then put it in the soup- 
kettle with eight quarts of cold water and a shin of 
veal ; let this boil three hours, and then set away to 
cool over night. In the morning cut up the veal and 
put into the soup-kettle, with a stalk of celery, one 
onion, one carrot, one turnip, two parsnips, three blades 
of mace, one stick of cinnamon, ten cloves, salt, pep- 
per, and two heads of parsley. Cover this with three 
pints of cold water, and boil two hours. Strain this, 
and wash the soup-kettle, then turn the soup back. 
Now skim the fat from stock, and put that into the ket- 
tle also. Put into the frying-pan two spoonfuls of but- 
ter, and when it boils up stir in four of dry flour, stir 
until a dark-brown (but not burned), and when the soup 
boils up stir this in. Now braid half of the brains 
(which you tied in a muslin cloth, and boiled with the 
head), and stir them in. Stir in also a spoonful of 
walnut catsup, one of mushroom catsup, and one of to 
mato catsup. Boil two hours, and then put in the face 



124 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

cut in very small strips, one glass of port wine, and 
one lemon cut into thin slices, and let it boil up once, 
and dish. When in the tureen, put in the egg balls. 
To make the egg balls, boil four eggs ten minutes, drop 
them in cold water, and take out the yolks and pound 
them in the mortar until they are reduced to a paste, 
then beat them with one teaspoonful of salt, a little 
pepper, and the white of one egg. Make them into 
round balls the size of a walnut, roll them in flour, and 
fry them brown in butter, being careful not to burn 
them. They are now ready for the soup. 

Oyster Soup. 

Wash one quart of oysters, if they are solid, in one 
quart of cold water ; if not, one pint of water ; drain 
the water through a cullender into the soup-kettle ; set 
the kettle on the fire, and when the liquor comes to a 
boil, skim it; then add one quart of rich new milk; 
just before it comes to a boil, turn in the oysters, and 
thicken with two spoonfuls of corn starch wet with milk ; 
then stir in half a cup of butter, and season with pep- 
per and salt. Let this boil up once, and serve immedi- 
ately. Be very careful that they do not burn. A safe 
way is to boil the milk in a basin, which is set into 
another of water, and then turn it on the oysters just 
before removing it from the fire. 



FISH. 

Baked God and Salmon. 

Take a fish weighing eight or nine pounds, wash and 
dry it ; then lay in the pan, and skewer to keep the 
head and tail together. Stuff the belly and eyes with 
a stuffing made of chopped pork, pounded biscuit, sweet 
herbs, pepper, salt, onions, aud butter. Sew up the 
belly, and bake two hours. Flour well and baste often. 
Make the gravy in the following manner : Stir into 
one pint of boiling water two spoonfuls of flour wet 
with cold water, one spoonful catsup, a pinch of ground 
mace, half a teaspoon of ground parsley, and a glass 
of red wine ; salt and pepper. Let this boil, and when 
the fish is dished, stir the gravy that is in the pan into 
the made gravy. Add the wine the last thing. Gar- 
nish the fish with sliced lemon and the yolks of hard 
boiled eggs. 

Scalloped Pish. 

Skin and cut into small pieces a cod or haddock, and 

lay in a deep earthen dish. Dredge in about half a 

cup of flour, one spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of 

pepper. Cut about two spoonfuls of butter into small 

pieces and strew in ; cover the whole with new milk, 

and bake forty minutes.

POULTRY. 

To Clean Poultry. 

First singe over blazing paper or alcohol ; then cut 
off the feet and tips of the wings, and the neck as far 
as it looks dark ; then, with the blade of a knife, take 
out all the pin-feathers; now turn the skin of the neck 
back, and with the fore-finger and thumb draw out the 
crop and windpipe ; cut a slit in the lower part of the 
fowl, and draw out the intestines, being careful not to 
break the gall-bag, as it will spoil the flavor of the meat. 
It will be found near the upper part of the breastbone 
and attached to the liver. Now wash thoroughly in sev- 
eral waters, and drain. If the poultry is at all strong, let 
ifc stand in water several hours, with either charcoal or 
salcratus. Split the gizzard, and take out the inside and 
inner lining ; wash and put on to boil in two quarts of 
cold water (this is for the gravy). 

Eoast Turkey. 

Prepare as directed ; make a dressing with six pounded 

crackers, one teaspoonful of pepper, one tablespoonful of 

salt, one of sage, one of summer-savory, one of parsley, 

two eggs, butter the size of an egg, and cold water to 

126 



POULTRY. 127 

moisten ; stuff the turkey with this ; stuff the breast first, 
and the remainder put in the body. Now cross and tie the 
legs down tight ; run a skewer through the wings, fasten- 
ing them to the body ; fasten the neck under the body 
with a skewer, and tie all with a twine. Rub the turkey 
with salt, and spit it ; baste often with the drippings and 
flour, and occasionally with butter. About fifteen min- 
utes before dishing baste with butter, and dredge on a 
little flour ; this will give it a frothy appearance. For 
eight pounds, allow one hour and three quarters, if 
roasted in the tin-kitchen ; if in the oven, one hour and 
half, and fifteen minutes for every pound more or less. 
Serve with giblet gravy and cranberry sauce. 

To make the gravy : Boil the heart, gizzard, liver, and 
neck in two quarts of water two hours ; then take them 
up and chop the gizzard and heart ; braid the liver and 
put them back again ; thicken with one spoonful of flour 
wet with cold water ; season with salt and pepper. Let 
this simmer one hour longer, and when you dish the 
turkey turn the drippings into this gravy ; boil up once, 
and send to the table. Make all the gravy for poultry 
in this manner, omitting the chopped gizzards in chicken 
gravy. 

Eoast Chicken. 

Prepare, stuff and truss the same as turkey. A pair of 
chickens, weighing each two and a half pounds, will 
require an hour and a quarter to roast if in the tin- 
kitchen ; one hour if in the oven. 



128 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Eoast Goose. 

Prepare, as directed for poultry, and stuff the body 
with a dressing made in the following manner : Pare and 
boil potatoes ; mash them and mix with one fourth of an 
onion chopped fine, one spoonful of sage, one of salt, one 
teaspoonful of pepper, a small piece of butter. Truss, 
and roast (if it weighs ten pounds) one hour and three 
quarters if in the tin-kitchen, but if in the oven one 
hour and a half. Make the gravy as for turkey, and 
serve with apple-sauce. 

Skim off all the fat before putting the drippings in 
the gravy. 

Koast Duck. 

Prepare the dressing as for goose, and roast before a 
hot fire forty minutes, or if in the oven have it very hot 
and roast thirty minutes. Serve with either apple-sauce 
or currant jelly. Make gravy the same as for turkey. 

This time cooks the goose and ducks rare. 

Koast Partridges. 

Clean and truss ; then lard and roast thirty minutes. 
Serve with currant jelly. To make the gravy : Put one 
spoonful of butter into a basin, and when it boils up stir 
in one spoonful of dry flour ; stir until a dark brown ; 
then pour on half a pint of boiling water. Season with 
salt, pepper, the partridge drippings, and a spoonful of 



POULTRY. 129 

currant jelly. Or serve with bread sauce, the rule for 
which you will find under sauces. 

To lard a bird : Cut fat salt pork into thin, narrow 
slices, and put one end of the slice through the eye of a 
larding needle. (You can obtain one at any kitchen 
furnishing store.) Now run the needle under the skin 
of the bird, and draw the pork half way through, hav- 
ing the pieces about an inch apart. 

Eoast Grouse. 

If you stuff them, make the dressing the same as for 
turkey ; but they are not often stuffed. Roast thirty 
minutes, and serve with currant jelly. The gravy made 
the same as before directed. 

Eoast Pigeons. 

Lard and roast the same as partridges. Make the 
gravy the same, with the addition of one teaspoonful of 
clove and half a wineglass of claret. The pigeons must 
be young, or they will not be nice roasted. 

Small Birds. 

Woodcock, quail, snipe, and plover may be cooked 
in the same manner as partridges, allowing fifteen min- 
utes to roast, and serve on toast. 



VENISON. 

Eoast Venison. 

If in winter keep the venison three weeks after being 
killed ; but if in summer, ten or twelve days will be 
sufficient. Draw the dry skin from a leg of venison, and 
cut off the shank ; roast half an. hour, and then baste 
with salt, water, butter, and flour ; when it has roasted 
one hour and a half, baste with claret wine. If it is to 
be served on blazers, two hours will ccok a leg weigh- 
ing fifteen pounds, but if not, roast four hours. A sad- 
dle of venison is cooked in the same way, but will re- 
quire only half as much time to roast. To make the 
grav}', put the shank in a basin with three quarts of 
cold water, a few cloves, one oniou, half a pound of 
beef, salt, and pepper ; boil until there is about a quart 
of liquor, then strain, and thicken with two spoonfuls of 
flour. When the venison is dished add the drippings 
and one glass of claret wine. Boil up once and serve. 
Have the dishes on which the venison is served and the 
plates very hot. 

Venison steak and pie is cooked the same as beef.

Stewed Beef with Mushrooms. 

Very nice. Take five pounds of beef (with as much 
tenderloin as possible), put in a pan, and set in the 
oven fifteen minutes ; then take the meat and put it in 
a small porcelain kettle, and dredge with salt, pepper, a 
teaspoonful of mace, half of clove, half of allspice, and 
two spoonfuls of flour ; now put in cold water enough 
to cover the meat, and stew slowly, keeping the stean 
in, three hours. Then put in half a tumbler of mush 
room catsup and a glass of claret wine, and simmer hall 
an hour longer. Serve with plenty of gravy. 

Fillet of Beef with Mushrooms. 

Cut the fillet into slices about half an inch thick, and 
lay them an hour in melted butter, having first sprinkled 
them with salt and pepper. At the end of that time 
place them over a brisk fire, and when well browned on 
one side turn them and brown on the other. Then lay 
them in a hot dish, and into the butter that remains in 
the pan put one spoonful of dry flour, and brown ; when 
brown, add half a cup of boiling water, and half a

wineglass of mushroom catsup or maderia wine. Foui 
the gravy over the fillet, and serve. 

Alamode Beef. 
Take six pounds of the round of beef, cut deep gashes 
in it, and rub into it a handful of salt, a spoonful of 
cinnamon, half of clove, half of allspice, one of mace, 
one of pepper, and half a cup of flour. Fill the gashes 
with dressing made as for turkey, with the addition of 
a little chopped onion. Sew the gashes together, and 
bind the beef with strips of cotton cloth. Lay the beef 
in a small kettle that can be covered tight ; put in a 
whole onion and cold water enough to cover the beef. 
Simmer three hours, and then make a thickening with 
four spoonfuls of flour, and stir in, and at the same time 
stir in two spoonfuls of either mushroom or walnut cat- 
sup and simmer one hour longer. Some persons think 
that the addition of a glass of claret or Madeira is an 
improvement ; but it is very nice without. 

Bonilli Beef. 
Take six pounds of lean beef and rub into it two 
spoonfuls of salt, one half of pepper, one cup of flour ; then 
lay in a small kettle, which you can cover tight. Cut 
into this one carrot, one small turnip, one onion, two 
parsnips, and cover with cold water. When it comes to 
a boil skim, then set back where it will simmer three 
hours ; at the end of this time thicken with three spoon- 
fuls of flour, and cut in three potatoes ; cover and sim- 
mer again one hour. If not seasoned enough, add more 
Bait and pepper.

take up the pork, dredge the chicken with salt, pepper, 
and flour, and fry a dark brown in the pork fat. When 
the chicken is all fried, stir into the remaining pork fat 
half a cup of dry flour ; stir this until a dark brown, then 
pour on it one quart of the liquor in which the chicken 
was boiled. (This liquor must be boiling.) Season with 
pepper and salt to taste. Lay the chicken in this gravy, 
and simmer twenty minutes. Garnish the dish with 
boiled rice.

f jail, cover with cold soft custard. (Dissolve a spoonful 
of gelatine in the custard when you make it.) Cover 
the mould and pack in a box of salt and ice, as you 
would ice cream. Let this stand in the salt and ice 
five hours. When you dish it dip the mould in a pail

l.~0 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

until the dish is nearly full ; thtn pour over the whule 
two thirds of a cup of cold water, and cover the whole 
with slices of cuke which have been dipped in cold 
water. Cover the whole with a plate, and bake slowly 
two hours. Serve with sugar and cream. (Use in all 
one cup of sugar.) Bread may be used instead of cake.

PIES. 

Puff Paste. 

Two cups of butter, one quart of flour, one tablespoon- 
ful of salt, one of powdered sugar. Wash the butter in 
cold water until it is light and waxy ; divide into two 
parts and set in the ice chest one hour. Mix the sugar 
and salt with the dry flour, and then wet with ice-water 
enough to make a soft paste (mix with a knife, and use 
the hands as little as possible) ; roll this on the board 
with the rolling-pin, about half an inch thick ; now cut 
one of the cakes of washed butter into thin slices, and 
spread on the paste ; dredge with flour and fold up ; then 
pound lightly with the pin, and then roll out as before, 
and spread the second cake of butter the same as* the 
first ; dredge and fold again ; now roll thin as before, 
and then roll up and place on a plate, and set in the ice 
chest one or two hours. When ready to cover the pie, 
cut just enough from the end of the roll to cover the pie ; 
sprinkle the board with a little flour, place the paste upon 
it, and flour the rolling-pin with the hand ; now roll from 
you, and towards your left hand ; roll very lightly until 
the right size ; then cover and bake immediately. Quick- 
ness and elasticity are very important, also the washing 

151 



152 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

of the butter. Use as little flour as possible in rolling the 
paste ; always make it in a cool room. It is a mistake 
to think the paste must be hard to be good ; always have 
it soft enough to roll easily. 

Green Apple Pies. 

Pare, quarter, core, and stew nice tart apples in water 
enough to prevent them from burning. When tender, 
sweeten very sweet with white sugar, fill the pie-plate, 
which has been lined and edged with paste, grate on a 
little nutmeg, cover and bake forty-five minutes. 

Dried Apple Pies. 

Pick and wash one quart of dried apples, and put in a 
porcelain kettle with two quarts of water and two of 
cider; let this stand over night, and in the morning 
place on the fire and simmer three hours; then lay in 
(but do not stir) two quarts of sugar, and simmer two 
hours longer ; then turn into a stone pot, and put 
away for use. Make the pies the same as green apple. 

Peach Pies. 

Line the plate with plain paste, and lay in the plate 
five peaches, which just press between the fingers, but 
do not take out the stones, as they flavor the pie ; now 
fill the plate with peaches which have been cut in two 
and the stones taken out. Sift over this a small cup of 



PIES. lo6 

sugar, and then add two spoonfuls of water. Cover and 
bake in a moderate oven one hour. Do not peel the 
peaches ; they are very much better not to be. 

Plum Pies. 
Made the same as peach. 

Mince Pies. 

Two pounds of tender lean beef; chop it while raw 
very fine ; take one cupful of chopped suet, two pint 
bowlfuls of chopped apple, one of stoned raisins, half a 
bowlful of currants, half a pound of citron, one bowlful 
of sugar, one half of molasses, two table spoonfuls of 
mace, two of cinnamon, one of allspice, one of cloves, 
four grated nutmegs, three tablespoonfuls of salt. Mis 
all this thoroughly with the hands, and then add one 
quart of cider. Put the mixture in a large earthen pan, 
and place over a kettle of boiling water and scald ; if 
there is not sugar and spice enough, season to taste. 
When scalded, stir in one pint of wine and half a pint of 
brandy. Do not let any one kind of spice predominate. 
If not moist enough, use more cider. Prepare the plates 
as for apple pies, and spread in a cupful of the mince 
meat and cover with a rich puff paste. Bake one hour. 

Lemon Pies. 

Line a medium-sized plate with plain paste, and rim 
with three thicknesses of puff paste ; set the plate in a cool 



154 THE ArPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

place until the filling is ready. Beat to a froth one tea- 
cup of sugar, the rind and juice of one lemon, and the 
yolks of two eggs ; then beat the whites of two eggs to 
a stiff froth, and stir in with one spoonful of milk ; turn 
this into the plate which you have prepared, and bake 
in a moderate oven forty-five minutes. Or you may line 
a deep plate with plain paste, as for squash pies, and 
turn the mixture into it, and bake forty minutes. This 
is very nice if the directions are exactly followed. 

Lenten Pics, 2To. 2 

The juice of two and the rind of three lemons, one cup 
of butter, one and a half of sugar, eight eggs. Beat the 
sugar, butter, lemons, and the yolks of the eggs together ; 
then add the whites beaten to a stiff froth. Bake in deep 
plates, line with plain paste, fifty minutes in a moderate 
oven. 

Marlborough Pies. 

Steam until tender six good-sized tart apples, and then 
run them through the cullender ; etir in, while they arc 
hot, one spoonful of butter ; when cool, stir in the yolks 
of three eggs, the rind and juice of one lemon, and one 
teacup of sugar, which have been beaten together. Bake 
in a moderate oven forty minutes, in a deep plate, as 
squash pies. Cut and bake little cakes of puff paste, and 
when the pie is cold, garnish it with them. 



PUDDING SAUCES. 

Eicli Wine Sauce. 

Beat to a cream half a cup of butter, and very grad- 
ually beat in one cup of sugar, one spoonful of corn 
starch, one wineglass of wine, and the white of one 
egg. When this is a perfect froth, stir in one third 
of a cup of boiling water ; set this in warm water for 
two minutes, stirring all the while, and then serve. 

Plain "Wine Sance. 

Put into a sauce-pan one cup of sugar and one cup 
of water ; grate into this half a nutmeg, and put on the 
fire to simmer ; let it simmer half an hour, and then add 
one glass of wine ; simmer ten minutes longer, and serve. 

5 Lemon Sance. 

Beat to a froth one spoonful of butter, one cup of 
sugar, one spoonful of corn starch, and two eggs. 
When very smooth and light, add one cup of boiling 
water. Set the basin into boiling water, and stir five 
minutes. Season with lemon, and serve.

1,36 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Vinegar Sauce. 

One cup of boiling water, one of sugar, one table- 
spoonful of flour, one of vinegar, and a little nutmeg. 
Mix the flour with a little cold water, and stir into 
the boiling sugar and water ; then stir in the vinegar 
and nutmeg, and boil twenty minutes. Wine sauce is 
very good made in this manner, using wine instead of 
vinegar. Season with a little salt. 



DISHES FOR THE SICK. 

Beef Tea. 

Cut half a pound of lean beef into very small pieces ; 
do not have a grain of fat on it, and put into a bottle 
that has a large opening (an olive or horseradish bottle 
will be nice) ; put in half a cup of cold water, and cork 
tight ; set this in a basin of cold water, and place on 
the fire where it will come to a boiling point, but not 
boil ; keep it at this temperature for two hours, then 
strain, and season with salt. 

Chicken Broth. 

Put the bones and about one pound of the lean meat 
of chicken into a sauce-pan with three pints of water. 
When it comes to a boil, skim well. Simmer three 
hours, and strain and salt. If the patient can bear it, 
a little rice or tapioca boiled with it is an improvement. 

Oatmeal Gruel. 

Into one quart of boiling water, sprinkle two table- 
spoonfuls of oatmeal ; let this boil forty minutes ; season 

157 



I ,>3 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

with salt, strain and serve. If sugar, milk, or cream is 
wished, it may be added. 

Indian Meal Gruel. 

One quart of boiling water ; stir into this one spoon- 
ful of flour and two of Indian meal, mixed with a little 
cold water. Boil thirty minutes. Season with salt, and 
strain. Use sugar and cream if you choose. If flour is 
not liked, use another spotfnful of meal instead. 

Plum Porridge. 

Into one quart of boiling milk stir two spoonfuls of 
flour mixed with cold milk ; put in a handful of raisins 
and a little grated nutmeg. Boil twenty minutes. Sea- 
son with salt and strain. 

Corn Tea. 

Brown and pound in a mortar, one cup of sweet dry 
corn ; pour on this two cups of boiling water, and steep 
fifteen minutes. This is very light and nutritious, and 
can be taken where the patient is very weak. 

Cream Toast. 

Heat half a cup of cream, and season with salt. 
Toast two slices of bread a light brown, and pour the 
cream over it. Serve immediately. 



DISHES FOR THE SICK. 159 

Wine Whey. 

Let one cup of new milk come to a boil, and then 
stir in half a wineglass of sherry wine. Boil a moment 
aud strain. 

Vinegar Whey. 

Boil one cup of milk, and stir in one spoonful of vin- 
egar; if this does not make it whey, stir in a little 
more; when it curdles, strain. 

Sour Milk Whey. 

To one cup of boiling sweet milk, and one cup of 
sour milk, and strain. 

A Good Drink for the Lungs. 

Wash clean a few pieces of Irish moss ; put it in a 
pitcher, and pour over it two cups of boiling water. 
Set where it will keep at the boiling point, but not 
boil for two hours. Strain, and squeeze into it the 
juice of one lemon. Sweeten to taste. If the patient 
cannot take lemon, flavor with wine, vanilla, or nutmeg. 

Another Drink. 

Beat lightly one egg and one spoonful of sugar. Stir 
into this one cup of new milk, half a wineglass cf wine, 
and a little nutmeg. This is nice without the wine. 



160 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Another Drink. 

Upon one teaspoonful of slippery-elm, pour one cup 
of boiling water, strain, and season as Irish moss. 

Lemonade. 

The juice of one lemon and one spoonful of sugar. 
Pour on this one cup of boiling water, and set away to 
cool. 

Another Beef Tea, 

Cut a pound of lean beef (the round is the best) into 
dice. Put into a sauce-pan, with a teaspoonful of salt, 
one of flour, and one fourth of pepper. Pour on this a 
large pint of cold water. Let it stand an hour or two, 
then put on the fire ; bring slowly to a boil, and boil 
slowly an hour. If it has boiled away too much, add a 
little hot water ; but this rather hurts it. Skim off care- 
fully every particle of fat. This tea is more palatable 
than the other, and can be taken by those not extremely 
sick. 

Sack Posset. 

Pound one Boston cracker, or one soda biscuit. Put 
it in a pint of cold milk ; set on the fire, and simmer 
fifteen minutes. Beat together one egg, one wineglass 
of wine, a little sugar, salt, and nutmeg. Turn this 
into the simmering milk, stirring constantly ; boil up 
once, and take from the fire immediately. 



DESSERTS. 

Charlotte Eusse. 

Cut stale sponge cake into slices about half an inch 
thick, and line three moulds with it, having a space of 
half an inch between each slice ; set the moulds where 
they will not be disturbed until the filling is ready. Now 
take a deep tin pan and fill about one third full of either 
snow or pounded ice, and into this set another pan that 
will hold at least four quarts. Into a deep bowl or pail, 
put one pint and a half of cream (if the cream is thick 
take one pint of cream and half a pint of milk), whip the 
cream to a froth, and when the bowl is full, skim the froth 
into the pan which is setting on the ice ; keep on doing, 
this until the cream is all froth; now with the spoon draw 
the froth to one side, and you shall find that there is some 
of the cream which has gone back to milk ; turn this into 
the bowl again, and whip as before ; when the cream is all 
whipped, stir into it two thirds of a cup of powdered 
sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla, and half a box of gela- 
tine, which has been soaked in cold water, enough to 
cover it, one hour, and then dissolved in boiling water 
enough to dissolve it, which will be nearly half a cupful ; 
stir all this from the bottom of the pan until it begins to 
grow stiff; then fill the moulds, and set them on the ice 
in the pan for one hour, or until they are sent to the table.

When ready to dish them, just loosen them at the sides, 
and turn out on a flat dish. Have the 4 cream ice cold 
when you begin to whip it ; it is a good plan to put a 
lump of ice into the cream while you are whipping it. 

The directions being so long, may make it appear to be 
a long and hard process ; but it is not so, for it is easily 
and quickly made. The whip-churn you can get made 
at your tinman's for a trifle, and as it will be found neces- 
sary to have one to make many of these dishes, I give 
below directions for making it. 



A, is a hollow cylinder of tin, perforated in 
the bottom and upon the sides, as repre- 
sented above. 

B, handle. 

C, dash of tin, and perforated like the bottom 
of the cylinder. 

D, cover, fitting close upon the upper end of 
tho cylinder. Have the cylinder three inches 
in diameter, and ten inches in height : the 
dash two and three-quarters inches in diam- 
eter, and the handle thirteen inches long. 
To be made of block tin. With care this 
will last in a private family fifty years. 



Note. —The whip-churn, for making Charlotte Russe and creams, 
can be procured at Sweetser and Clark's, Market Street, Portsmouth, 
N. U., and at F. A. Walker & Co.'s, 83 and 85 Cornhill, and Nos. 6

Moss Blanc-mange. 

Free from pebbles and seaweed, and wash in several 
waters one cup of Irish moss (get that that is not pressed); 
let it soak in cold water one hour, then tie up in a mus- 
lin bag, and put in a tin pail with three quarts of new 
milk. Set the pail in a kettle with hot water, and boil

Blanc-mange in "Wine Sauce. 

Put one quart of new milk into a basin, and set the 
basin in another with hot water. When the milk comes 
to a boil, stir in four spoonfuls of corn starch mixed with

and cut it up in small squares, and fill wineglasses with 
it. Put half of each kind on a plate. Wine jelly may 
be colored a bright pink by using cochineal ; yellow, 
by using tincture of saffron, and green, by using the 
juice of spinage ; but I would not recommond the use 
of any coloring 

Soft Custard. 

Put one quart of new milk into a tin pail, and set the 
pail into a kettle with boiling water, and sweeten with

the back of the spoon, and stir into the boiling milk, 
and then stir in six well-beaten eggs ; stir three min- 
utes, and then strain. Set in cold water and stir oc- 
casionally, until cold, then stir in two teaspoons of 
vanilla. Serve in glasses. 

Coffee Custard. 

Tie one cup of ground coffee in a piece of muslin,

out and stir in one heaping cup of sugar, and the whites 
of four and the yolks of eight eggs ; stir two minutes 
and strain ; set in cold water, and stir occasionally until 
cool. Serve in glass. All custards are improved by a 
very little salt. 

Steamed Custards. 

Make the same as for baked, and steam until they are 
firm in the centre. 

Baked Custards.

deep glass dish, with the whites of the eggs heaped in 
the centre. 

Apple Snow. 

Pare, slice, and quarter ten good-sized tart apples ; 
6team them until tender, and then run them through the 
cullender, and set where they will get ice cold. When

one cup of 6ugar, and the whites of six eggs. Beat all 
to a froth, and serve immediately in a deep glass dish. 

Tipsy Parson.

three at a time on the paste, and beat all together half 
an hour. When light, drop on tin sheets. Have half a 
spoonful in a cake, and drop about two inches apart. 
Bake forty minutes in a rather quick oven. When baked,

Beat to a froth three eggs and one teacup of sugar ; stir 
into this one heaping coffee cup of flour, in which one 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar and half of saleratus are 
thoroughly mixed. Flavor with lemon. Butter tin sheets 
with washed butter (lard or salt butter will make them 
taste bad), and drop in teaspoonfuls about three inches 
apart. Bake instantly in a very quick oven. Watch very 
closely, as they will burn easily. Serve with ice cream. 



Beat to a stiff froth the whites of two eggs, and beat 
into them, very gradually, two teacups of powdered sugar 
and two tablespoonfuls of corn starch. Flavor with lemon.

which you cut from the centre, and roll about ono 
quarter of an inch thick ; cut this out with a large 
cutter, and wet with cold water ; lay the rims on these, 
and bake in a quick oven about twenty five minutes 
When cold, fill with any kind of jam or jelly.

Directions for Preezing. 

Set the freezer in the centre of the tub ; be sure that 
everything is in place, or it will not work when you 
get it packed. Ilavc the ice chopped fine, and put in 
a layer about three inches deep, then a layer of 
coarse salt about an inch deep, and then the ice, and 
so on, until the tub is full, having the ice last. Use 
about one third salt, and two thirds ice. It must be 
packed very solid. After the cream has been put in, 
and you have turned it ten minutes, pack again, and 
be sure to get it solid. When the water is trouble- 
some, let off some, but not all. Stop the hole imme- 
diately, and pack to fill the space that was occupied 
by the water, as the mixture will not freeze until all 
air is excluded. Beat one way until you can no longer 
turn the beater. Now carefully brush the ice and salt 
from the cover and take out the beater; cover again 
and put a cork in the cover. Now pack again with ice 
and salt. Cover the whole with a piece of old carpet, 
and let it stand a few hours. Or if you wish to put it in 
moulds, fill them as eoon as you take out the beater ; 
pack them down well, or they will not look smooth 
when taken out. If you use an old-fashioned freezer, 
you must have a long iron spoon to beat it with, 
and a long knife to cut it from the sides with. 
Turn the freezer with the hands ; take off the cover 
every fifteen minutes. Scrape the cream from the sides, 
and then beat, as you would cake, for ten minutes. 



DESSERTS. 173 

When hard, light, and smooth, cover as before directed, 
or put in moulds Lay the moulds in ice and salt for 
three hours, and when ready to dish, dip them in warm 
water for an instant. Wipe and turn the mould on an 
ice cream dish ; remove very gently. Serve immedi- 
ately 

Ice Cream made with Cream. 

Take four quarts of cream and sweeten with one 
heaping quart of* sugar. Flavor with anything you 
please, but very strong. 

Coffee Ice Cream. 

Made the same as chocolate, but using coffee in- 
stead of chocolate. Tie one pint of ground coffee in a 
piece of muslin, and boil in the milk half an hour be- 
fore ; then take it out, and make as before directed. 

Lemon Ice Cream. 

Put two quarts of rich milk into a tin pail, and set 
into a kettle with hot water ; when this comes to a boil, 
stir in four spoonfuls of corn starch ; wet with one cup 
of milk. Cook this twenty minutes, and then add the 
yolks of" twelve eggs, well beaten, stir a few minutes, 
and then take of and cool ; before cooling, stir in one 
heaping quart of sugar. When ice cold, add two quarts 
of cream, or rich milk will answer, and freeze. 

Vanilla, pineapple, and all other kinds of cream may 
be made m the same way, but use eight whites and yolks 



174 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

instead of twelve yolks of eggs For strawberry and rasp- 
berry cream, allow ihe juice of one quart of berries to one 
gallon of cream. Some persons object to corn starch, 
but it makes a very much smoother and handsomer 
ci earn than when it is all made of eggs. Where all 
eggs are used, make the same as soft custard, and allow 
one quart of cream or milk to one quart of custard. 

Chocolate Ice Cream. 

Made the same as the others, with the addition of 
one cake of chocolate, and one pint more of sugar 
Prepare the chocolate as for chocolate custard. 

Lemon Sherbet. 

One gallon of ice water, the juice of twenty lemons, 
and three pints of sugar; strain into the freezer, and 
freeze as you would cream. 

Currant, strawberry, raspberry, and orange sherbets 
may be made in the same manner. 

N. B. To flavor ice creams, use the extract. Lubin's 
is the best. 

Eoman Punch. 

Two quarts of cold water, one of Madeira wine, half a 
pint of brandy, the juice of six lemons, and two quarts 
of sugar. This is very hard to freeze. In winter use 
snow instead of ice. 



CAKE. 

Remarks. 

While making piea and cakes, the first thing to be 
done is to build your fire and get your oven just right. 
Now sift your flour, and measure it ; count and break 
your eggs ; measure every thing you are going to put 
in the cake ; lard your pans and line them with paper. 
Here is a formula, which it will be well to follow in 
making all kinds of cake in which you put butter. 

Beat the butter to a cream, and then add the sugar 
gradually ; then spice and any kind of liquor which you 
use, then the milk, then the eggs well beaten, then the 
flour, in which always mix thoroughly, while dry, the sal- 
eratus and cream of tartar, and if fruit, let that always be 
the last thing to be added. 

One, Two, Three, Four Cake. 

One coffee-cup of butter, two of sugar, four of flour, 

one of milk, five eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, 

two of cream of tartar, lemon. This will make two 

good sized sheets. Bake one half plain, and the other 

half spice with one teaspoonful of cinnamon, one half 

of clove, the same of allspice and nutmeg. Bake in a 

rather quick oven.

cut with an oval cutter. Bake on tin sheets, in a quick 
oven, until a dark brown. These will keep a year, if 
kept in a tin box and in a dry place. 



PRESERVES. 

In making preserves, use a porcelain kettle which 
should be used for nothing else. Have also a large 
wooden spoon, which keep expressly for this use. Be 
very careful not to let the sirup barn or boil over, and 
always skim carefully. Look at your preserves once a 
month at least, and if they are beginning to ferment, 
scald and skim. If they mould on top that will not in- 
jure them, but will keep the air from them and thus pro- 
tect them. Be very careful when removing it not to get 
any of it in the sirup. Preserves should be kept in a 
cool, dry place. Always seal them while hot, as by this 
means you do not seal air in ; but if they are allowed 
to grow cold before sealing they will not keep so well. 
Ilcat the jars before putting the preserves in, by set- 
ting them in a pan of warm water, and let it heat grad- 
ually until it comes to a boiling point. Cut note-paper 
in round pieces about two inches deeper than the mouth 
of the jar ; make a paste with the white of an egg and 
a little flour; wet the edges with it and paste on. 

Preserved Peaches. 

Pare and cut in two peaches that have begun to mellow, 
but they must be ripe. Take out the stones and then put 

18T 



188 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

the fruit; in a large earthen dish, cover with coffee 
crushed sugar. For every pound of fruit allow one 
pound of sugar. Let this stand over night, and in the 
morning turn the sirup into the preserving kettle, and 
clarify ; then put in the peaches and cook until tender, 
which will be in about thirty minutes. Lay them in a 
Btone pot, and pour the boiling simp over them. 
When cool, put in small jars, and paste note-paper over 
the top. Keep in a cool, dry place. 

Preserved Pears. 

Pare, but do not cut them up. Weigh them, and 
then boil until tender in just water enough to cover 
them. When tender, take them out and make a sirup 
of the water in which they were boiled, and the sugar; 
allow one pint of water and one pound of sugar to 
every pound of fruit. Boil this one hour, and then put 
in the pears and one sliced lemon to every pound ; boil 
gently for forty minutes, then take up, and when cool 
put in jars Boil the sirup until thick, and if the jars 
are stone, pour over the pears while hot. 

Crab Apple Preserves. 

Wash the apples and drain ; leave the stems on them. 
Make a sirup with the same weight of sugar that you 
have apples, and half a pint of water to a pound of 
sugar ; simmer the apples in this forty-five minutes, and 
then take out and lay in a stone jar. Let the sirup 
simmer one hour longer, and turn boiling on the apples. 
Seal while hot, with note-paper. „ 



PRESERVES. 189 

Preserved Pineapple. 

Pare and cut the pineapple in slices about an inch thick. 
Cover with an equal weight of sugar, and let it stand over 
night. In the morning proceed as wiih peach preserves. 

Preserved Citron Melon. 

Pare and cut the melon into handsome pieces about an 
inch thick. Boil gently until tender, in just water 
enough to cover it ; as soon as it is tender, take out and 
lay in a platter, and put more on to boil. Do this until 
all is cooked. Now make a sirup of the weight of the 
melon in sugar (which weigh before cooking) and the 
water in which it was boiled. Let this boil one hour ; 
then put in the melon, and one lemon sliced to each 
pound of melon ; a few cloves. Simmer fifty minutes, 
then take up and boil the sirup half an hour longer, 
then pour over the melon while hot. 

Preserved Apples. 

Pare and quarter good tart apples ; preserve them the 
same as melon, omitting the cloves. They are nice to 
use late in the spring and early in the summer for 
green apple pies ; but as a preserve, they are too insipid. 

Preserved Plums. 

Take the weight of the plums in sugar, and to two 
pounds of sugar allow half a pint of water. Make a 



ICO THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

sirup of this, and when clear, boil the plums in it for 
forty-five minutes. Do not put many in it at a time. 
When they are all done, let the sirup boil an hour, and 
pour over them while hot. Seal with note-paper. This 
rule will answer for all kinds of plums. 

Preserved Cherries. 
Cherries are preserved the same as plums. 

Preserved Quinces. 

Pare, quarter, and cut out the cores. Save the par- 
ings and cores for jelly. Preserve the same as pears, 
omitting the lemon. 

Kaspberry Jam. 

Take equal weights of raspberries and sugar ; put the 
berries in a dish and cover with the sugar, and let them 
stand over night. In the morning put in the kettle and 
boil two hours (skimming carefully), and put up in jars; 
seal with note paper. Strawberries and blackberries are 
cooked in the same manner. 

Barberries Preserved with Pears. 

Weigh the barberries, and make a sirup of an equal 
weight of sugar, allowing half a pint of water to a pound 
of sugar. When the sirup is clear, put in the barberries 
(which must be free from steirs), and boil fifty minutes 



PRESERVES. 101 

When the barberries are all cooked, put as many pears, 
pared arid quartered, as you have barberries into the sirup, 
and boil until tender ; then take up and put with the 
barberries. Boil the sirup thirty minutes, and then pour 
boiling over the fruit. 

Barberries Preserved in Molasses. 

One peck of barberries, six quarts of molasses. Pick 
the barberries free from stems and imperfect ones. Let 
the molasses come to a boil, then put in the barberries, 
and boil about fifty minutes. They will be clear and full 
when done. Skim them out and put in the jars. Save 
two quarts of the sirup for drinks, and turn the remainder 
over the barberries. Be very careful that the molasses 
shall not burn. Sweet apples may be cooked with these 
in the same manner that pears are cooked with those done 
in sugar. 

Grape Marmalade. 

Put the grapes in a stone pot, and set the pot into a 
kettle with cold water ; set this on the fire and boil until 
the grapes will mash easily ; stir them often, and jam 
with bowl of the spoon. Take them up and strain 
through a sieve. To a quart of the pulp allow a pint of 
sugar, and boil forty minutes. 

Currant Jelly. 

To be nice the currants must he just ripe, and neither 
more nor less. Put them, stems and all, into a stone pot 



192 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

and cover to keep the steam in. Set the pot into a kettle 
with cold water, and place on the fire. Boil until they 
will all jam easily. Jam them with the bowl of the spoon. 
Lay a piece of thin muslin in a sieve, and turn the cur- 
rants into it ; squeeze the juice through. If you arc care- 
ful to have it clear now, you will not have to strain it 
after the sugar is added. To a pint of juice add a pint 
of sugar, and boil fifty minutes. Take it off the fire and 
let it stand until so cool that it will not break the glasses, 
but no longer, and then fill the glasses ; let them stand in 
the sun a few days, and them seal with note-paper. 

Currant Shrub. 

Make the same as jelly but boil only ten minutes 
When cool, bottle. Raspberry, strawberry, and black- 
berry shrubs made in the same way. 

Apple Jelly. 

Make the same as quince, with the addition of a stick 
of cinnamon and one lemon to a quart of juice, after the 
6Ugar is added. It will take longer to cook than quince. 

Quince Jelly. 

Put the cores and parings in the preserving kettle, 
and cover with cold water. Boil gently two hours ; 
then squeeze through a thick piece of cloth, and to a 
pint of juice allow a pint of sugar. Boil until it will 



PRESERVES. 193 

jelly when a little is put in a saucer, then treat as 
currant jelly. Where water is put with fruit you can- 
not limit the time of boiling. 

To Can Berries. 

Put the berries in a nice tin pan, and set over a boiler 
of boiling water, and to a gallon of berries allow one 
cup of boiling water ; heat the berries to a boiling 
point. (Cover them, and stir occasionally, and they 
will heat much sooner.) Heat self-sealing jars by putting 
them in a pan of cold water. Set on the stove, and 
let the water boil ; now fill the jars to the top, and put 
on the covers, and set up ; as the glass is expanded 
by the heat, they cannot be set tight now ; but after 
they become cool, get a man to set them up very tight. 
Set away in a cool, dry place. Always use the fruit as 
soon as opened. If these directions are followed, you 
may put up any kind of fruit, and keep it nice for years. 



PICKLES. 

Pickled Cucumbers. 

Pick the cucumbers before they" get very large ; lay 
them in a tub, aud cover with a boiling brine of one 
gill of salt to one gallon of water ; let this stand until 
cold, and then turn the brine back into the kettle 
and boil again, and pour over the cucumbers; do this 
five times, and then turn off and cover with boiling 
alum water (allow one heaping spoonful of alum to one 
gallon of water). When cold, turn off, and boil again, 
and turn on the cucumbers a second time. When this 
is cold turn off, and drain the cucumbers Now put on 
a few quarts of good cider vinegar in a porcelain ket- 
tle, and when it boils, drop a few cucumbers in- at a 
time, and let them boil about eight minutes; then skim 
out and drain. Do this until they are all scalded. Lay 
them in a stone pot and cover with good cider vinegar. 
You may use bell peppers and spice if you choose. 
You cannot fail to have good pickles if you follow this 
rule. 

Tomato Fickles. 

Cut green tomatoes into slices about an inch thick, 

and sprinkle with salt. (Allow half a cup of salt to a 

peck of tomatoes), and let them stand over night. In 

the morning turn off all the liquor and scald them in 

191 



PICKLES. 105 

boiling vinegar; then lay them in the stone pots and 
sprinkle between them half a spoonful of white mustard 
seed and a handful of whole cloves. Cover with cold 
vinegar. 

Tomato Pickles, Ho. 2. 

Cut a peck of green tomatoes in slices, and lay in a 
stone jar ; cover with one pint of molasses. Skim when 
it ferments, and your pickles are made. This is good. 

Piccalilli. 

Slice one peck of tomatoes and sprinkle with one 
handful of salt; let them stand over night, and in the 
morning turn off the liquor. Chop the tomatoes, one 
cabbage-head, seven onions, and four green peppers. 
Mix with this half a pint of whole mustard, half a tea- 
cup of sugar, half a teacupful of horseradish, and vin- 
egar enough to cover the whole. Stew until soft. 

Tomato Catsup. 

Cut up one gallon of ripe tomatoes, and put on in a 
porcelain kettle and boil. Prepare half a pint of sugar, 
half a pint of strong cider vinegar, or more if not strong ; 
one tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of cloves, one 
of allspice, one quarter of a teaspoonful of cayenne pep- 
per. Boil the tomatoes half an hour and then run them 
through a sieve. Now put them on with the spice, vine- 
gar, and sugar, and boil until there is about two quarts 
and a pint. Cool and bottle. 



SAUCES. 

Drawn Butter. 

Beat one cup of butter and two spoonfuls of flour to 
a cream, and pour over this one pint of boiling water. 
Set on the fire and let it come to boil, but do not boil 
Serve immediately. 

Egg Sauce. 

Chop up two hard boiled eggs, and stir into drawn 
butter. 

Oyster Sauce. 

Set a basin on the fire with half a pint of oysters and 
one pint of boiling water ; let them boil three minutes, 
and then stir in half a cup of butter beaten to a cream, 
with two spoonfuls of flour ; let this come to a boil, 
and serve. 

Celery Sauce. 

Chop fine two heads of celery, and boil one hour ; at 

the end of that time, have about a pint and a half of 

water with it, and stir in two spoonfuls of flour wet with 

cold water. Boil this ten minutes, and then stir in two 

spoonfuls of butter. Season with pepper and salt, and 

serve. 

196 



SAUCES. 197 

Caper Sauce.

of vinegar and a spoonful of sugar. 

Bread Sauce. 

Half a pint of grated bread crumbs, one pint of milk, 
and one onion. Boil this until the sauce is smooth, 
then take out the onion and stir in two spoonfuls of but- 
ter, and salt and pepper. Boil up once, and serve. 

Coddled Apples. 

Pare and core with an apple-corer, cook the same as 
for apple-sauce ; but allow one pint of sugar to one quart 
of water. 

Cranberry Sauce. 

Pick and wash the cranberries, and put in the preserv- 
ing kettle with half a piut of water to one quart of ber- 
ries ; now put the sugar on top of the berries, allowing 
a pint of sugar to a quart of berries. Set on the fire and 
stew about half an hour. Stir often to prevent burning. 
They will not need straining, and will preserve their rich 
color cooked in this way. Never cook cranberries be- 
fore putting in the sugar. Less sugar may be used if 
you do not wish them very rich. 



198 * THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Apple Sauce. 

Pare, quarter, and core nice tart apples Make a 
sirup of two quarts of water and one cup of sugar; 
simmer the apples in this until tender, but do not 
break them ; then lay in an earthen dish ; do this until 
they are all cooked. (Do not put many in the sirup at 
a time), and then let the sirup get cool, and turn on 
the apples. 

Baked Pears. 

Put the pears in a deep earthen dish or a baking-pan, 
and to a dozen good sized pears allow half a cup of 
sugar and a pint and a half of water. Bake in a mo- 
derate oven two hours and a half or three. They will 
not keep many days cooked in this manner, but they 
arc nice. Sweet apples are cooked in the same manner. 

Stewed Prunes. 

Wash the prunes in warm water and rub them well 
between the hands. Put them in a kettle that you can 
cover tight, with two quarts of water to one of prunes. 
Stew them gently two hours, These will not keep more 
than two days in, warm weather, but cooked in this way 
they do not require any sugar, and arc very nice. 

Dried Apple Sauce. 
Pick and wash the apples carefully, then place in a 



SAUCES. 199 

preserving kettle. For one pint of dried apple cut the 
thin yellow skin off a lemon, and then pare and cut up 
the inside. Put the yellow skin (be careful not to get 
any of the white) and the inside into the kettle with 
the apple, and three pints of cold water. Cover tight, 
and simmer three hours, then put in one pint of sugar, 
but do not stir the apple, and simmer two hours longer. 
Never stir dried apple-sauce. 



DRINKS. 



Tea. 

Scald the teapot and put in the tea, allowing one tea- 
tpoonful to each person ; pour over this half a cup of 
boiling water (soft water is the best), and steep in a 
hot place, but not where it will boil, ten minutes ; then 
turn in all the boiling water you wish, and serve. 

Coffee. 

Put one cup of ground coffee and one pint of cold 
water into the coffee-pot ; set the pot on the fire and 
boil ten minutes after it comes to a boil ; then turn in 
a pint of boiling water and a piece of salt fish skin about 
an inch square. Boil ten minutes longer, then turn in 
half a cup of cold water and set one side five min- 
utes ; turn into another pot, and send to the table. Al- 
ways serve boiled milk with coffee. 

Shells. 

Put one quart of cold water and half a cup of shells 
into the pot, and boil gently four or five hours ; add 
boiling water occasionally. About twenty minutes be- 
fore serving, add one pint of new milk and boiling water 
enough to make three pints in all ; let this boil a few 

minutes, strain and serve. 
200 



DRINKS. 201 



Chocolate. 



With four spoonfuls of grated chocolate mix one of 
sugar, and wet with one of boiling water. Rub this 
smooth with the bowl of the spoon, and then stir into 
one pint of boiling water ; let this boil up once, and 
then add one pint of good milk ; let this boil up once, 
and serve. 

Prepared Cocoa. 

Prepared cocoa is made the same as chocolate, omitting 
the sugar. All milk may be used if preferred. Never 
boil chocolate or prepared cocoa more than one min- 
ute. Boiling makes it oily. The quicker it is used 
after making the better. 



EGGS. 

Boiled Eggs. 

Put the eggs in a tin basin and pour boiling water 
jver them ; let them stand on a part of the stove where 
they will keep hot, but not boil, for ten minutes, or boil 
in boiling water three minutes and a half. The first 
method is the best. This is for rare done eggs. 

Tried Eggs. 

Have boiling lard in the frying pan; break the eggs 
into a saucer one at a time, and slide them gently into 
the pan ; now, with a large spoon, dip the boiling lard 
and pour i.t over the eggs ; do this until they are set, 
then dish. 

Dropped Eggs. 

Turn a quart of boiling water into a basin with one 
spoonful of salt. Break the eggs, one at a time, into a 
saucer ; dip one side of the saucer into the water and 
let the eggs slide gently into it. Boil gently until sot, 
which will be in about two minutes, and serve on toast. 

Peached Eggs. 

Break and beat up two eggs, and stir into them two 
tablespoonfuls of milk and half a teaspoonful of salt ; put 
2^2 



EGGS. 203 

them into a basin, with half a spoonful of butter, and 
set over the fire. Stir until it thickens, and then serve. 

Scrabbled Eggs. 

Beat together four eggs, and then turn into a pan 
with one spoonful of melted butter. Stir quickly over a 
hot fire one minute, and serve. 

Omelets. 

Beat lightly two eggs, and stir in one spoonful of 
milk and a pinch of salt. Heat the omelet pan hot, 
and then put in a little bit of butter, and when melted 
turn in the beaten eggs ; set on the fire, shake the pan, 
cook until a light brown ; then fold the omelet and serve 
on a hot dish. Ham, mushroom, lobster, chicken, and 
all kinds of omelets are made by chopping up the meat, 
and laying it between the folds before dishing. 



Miscellaneous Receipts. 



Buttered Toast. 

Beat to a froth one cup of butter and three table- 
spoonfuls of flour ; pour over this one pint and a half 
of boiling water ; set this over a kettle of boiling water 
for ten minutes. Cut bread in slices half an inch thick ; 
toast brown and dip into this. Serve very hot. 

Milk Toast. 

Put one quart of milk in a tin pail or basin, and set into 
a kettle of boiling water. When it comes to a boil stir 
in two spoonfuls of flour, mixed with half a cup of milk, 
one spoonful of butter, and salt to taste; let this boil 
ten minutes, and then put in the bread, which must be 
toasted brown. Cook five minutes longer and serve. 

Trench Toast. 

Soak bakers' bread, as for Italian fritters ; toast brown, 
butter and serve hot.

Sandwiches. 

Take the pieces of ham which are left on the bone alter 
all the slices are cut off and chop rather fine. Cut bread 
into thin slices (the milk yeast is the best for this) and 
butter. Now spread with the ham, and lay another but- 
tered slice over this. Trim the edges. This is a very 
nice dish for evening parties or picnics. Fold them in 
a damp towel until they are sent to the table. They 
may be made by putting slices of cold ham, tongue, 
beef, or .chicken between the slices of buttered bread. 



Oyster Stew. 

Drain all the liquor from the oysters ; put it into a 
porcelain kettle, and let it come to a boil ; then skim off 
ail the scum. Now turn in the milk, which you have let 
conie to aboil in hot water. (Allow one quart of milk 
to .one pint of oysters. ) Stir in also one spoonful of but-

Frosting. 

Beat to a froth the white of one egg. Beat into it, 
very gradually, one teacup of powdered sugar, and one 
scant tablespoonful of corn starch, and the juice of 
one lemon. Spread this over the cake, then wet a 
clean knife in cold water and smooth the frosting 
with it. Set in a warm, dry place to harden. 

Frosting, No. 2. 

Take about one sixteenth part of an ounce of gela- 
tine and put in a bowl ; just moisten with cold water, 
and let it stand half an hour ; then pour on it boiling 
water enough to dissolve ; now stir in powdered sugai 
enough to thicken. Season with lemon, ar.d spread on 
the cake. This is not so handsome as that made with 
the white of an egg, but is made quickly, and will 
harden in half an hour. Frost the cake while it is 
warm, as it dries more quickly and adheres better. 

Whitpot Pudding. 

One cup of Indian meal, one of molasses, a little salt. 
Scald thoroughly with boiling water. Add a quart of 
milk ; pour into the baking-dish and bake one hour, 
stirring thoroughly at least twice while it is baking. 
Let it get about half cool before you servo it. 



210 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Boiled Indian Pudding. 

Four cups of Indian meal, one cup of beef suet chopped 
fine, one cup of molasses, a little salt. Pour on boiling 
water enough to make a thick batter. Boil in a cloth, 
tied very loosely, two hours or more. Put in the pot 
before the water quite boils. Serve with butter and sirup. 

Spiced Currants. 

Five pounds of currants, four pounds of sugar, one pint 
of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of cloves, two of cinna- 
mon. Stew half an hour. To eat with roast meat. 

Chili Sauce, 

Take nine large or eighteen small tomatoes, scald, 
peel, and chop, with two peppers and one large 
onion. Add one tablespoonful of salt, two of sugar, one 
teaspoonful each of ginger, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, 
one nutmeg, and two small cups of vinegar. Stew half 
an hour ; bottle while hot. 

Graham Pies. Mrs. C. Thaxter. 

Into a pint of Graham flour, stir one teaspoonful of 
salt; wet with boiling water enough to make a stiff 
paste. Roll this very thin, and cut into cakes about 
three inches in diameter ; put into these a spoonful of 
apple-sauce and fold them. Bake on tin sheets. These 
can be eaten by any dyspeptic. 



REMARKS ON DIGESTION. 

In the stomach is produced a liquid secretion called 
the gastric juice. This does not act upon starch or fat 
of any kind. The only thing it dissolves is the albu- 
minous matter. Now, when this albuminous matter is 
not saturated with fat, the gastric juice acts upon it 
readily ; but, as in the case of pastry, doughnuts, fried 
meats, etc., where the whole mass is saturated with a 
fatty substance, it takes a long time before the gastric 
juice can get at the albuminous matter to act upon it; 
hence the distress by the over working of the stomach ; 
and, if this kind of food is partaken of frequently, the 
stomach force will be weakened, and refuse to do its 
work. This will disarrange every other member of the 
digestive organs ; and, in a short time, you have a first- 
class dyspeptic. All food, therefore, should be as light, 
porus, and free from fat as possible. 

When fat is used, it should be in such a manner that 
it will separate readily from the other substances on 
entering the stomach. Alcohol retards digestion, and 
renders it incomplete, by coagulating the gastric juice. 
Food, when taken into the stomach either very hot or 
very cold, docs not digest readily. Food taken when 

211 



212 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

the body or mind is very tired does not digest readily. 
Digestion goes on very slowly during sleep ; but it is 
more complete, and repairs the waste of the body more 
thoroughly than the rapid digestion of the walking 
hours. Children digest food more rapidly than adults, 
and should therefore be given a light lunch, when more 
than four hours intervene between the regular meals. 

It is a great mistake to think that light breakfasts 
are better than substantial ones. The breakfast sup- 
plies the fuel for the great waste which goes on during 
the busiest part of the day, and therefore should be of 
a simple, nutritious character, and an abundant supply 
of it. Another mistake made by many persons is the 
taking of a number of hours of exercise before break- 
fast. 

The stomach, while empty, is in a condition to re- 
ceive disease. In a high, dry atmosphere, there is less 
danger from this habit ; but in a country which is at all 
malarious, it is one of the most dangerous things which 
can be done. 

Regularity as to the time of eating is also one of 
the necessary things to be observed, that the digestion 
may be perfect. Pastry should be used very sparingly, 
puddings, fruit, and light deserts taking the place of 
pics 

The preparation of food should be made more a 
matter of conscience, with the housekeeper and cook, 
than it is at present. In planning the preparation of a 
dish, the question should not be, Is it convenient, and 



REMARKS ON DIGESTION. 213 

will it please ? but, Will it be healthful, mentally, moi> 
ally, and physically ? for the food we eat affects all 
three natures. 

Then food, to do its highest and best work, must be 
of the best quality, prepared carefully (but always to 
retain its simplest form), partaken of regularly in a 
cheerful 100m and in cheerful company. 



MEDICINAL. 

Unfailing Cure for Constipation. 

Three teacupfuls of coarse, clean wheat-bran, three 
of sifted flour, one heaping teaspoonful of cream-tartar, 
one-half of soda, one of salt, seven of sweet butier. 
Mix with cold milk, and roll into thin biscuit; and bake 
thoroughly in a moderately hot oven. They should be 
from one fourth to one-third of an inch thick, and be 
cut with a small biscuit-cutter. 

Great care must be taken that they do not burn, and 
at the same time that they get thoroughly baked. They 
will keep a long time if kept in a tight tin box ; and 
they should be eaten at each meal. — From Mr. Leonard 
Scott, after twenty yearn 7 experience. 

Cure, No. 2. 

A little while before retiring, mix a tablespoonful of 
flaxseed in cold water enough to make it pour readily, 
and, on going to bed, drink this. It is not nauseating 
at all, and will act on the bowels without deranging them 
as drugs always do. 

Drinking a glass of cold water at night and in the 
morning helps many persons. Eating fruit is also good. 
214 



MEDICINAL. 215 

Persons having this trouble should eat vegetables, meats, 
hominy, oatmeal, and coarse breads. They should also 
take a great deal of exercise. 

Diarrhoea. 

Brown rice as you would the coffee bean, and then 
either grind or mash in the mortar ; take half a cup of 
the ground rice, and pour about a quart of boiling 
water over it and let it stand about ten or fifteen min- 
utes ; then strain and sweeten with loaf sugar and sea- 
son with boiled milk. Drink of this freely. This is par- 
ticularly nice for children. 



Cure No. 2. — Hour Gruel. 

Let one quart of fresh milk come to a boil, and then 
stir in one tablcspoonful of flour, which has been mixed 
with milk enough to make a smooth paste ; boil this 
mixture thirty minutes, being careful not to let it burn. 
Season with salt and strain. The patient should be kept 
warm and quiet. 

Inflammation of the Bowels, 

Cover the bowels with thin slices of fresh beef, and, 
when they begin to grow dark, remove them and put on 
more fresh beef ; continue this until the inflammation is 
all drawn out. 



216 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Burns. 

Wet salcratus and spread on a cloth ; bind this around the 
burnt part, and, in few hours, it will be nearly well, unless 
^hc burn is very deep, in which case the saleratus should 
60 removed ; and after being removed the burn should 
be covered with a piece of old linen on which has been 
•^bbed a little mutton tallow or sweet oil. 

Neuralgia. 

One of the causes of neuralgia is constipation ; and 
therefore one of the first things to do is to get the 
bowels in a healthy condition. 

A poultice made from the common white bean is a 
great relief. Boil the beans in water enough to make a 
thick paste ; mash them, and spread the paste thickly on 
a cloth : then cover the paste with a thin piece of muslin, 
and bind on the painful parts. The bean poultice will 
retain heat longer than one made of any thing else ; and, 
as heat and moisture opens the pores, it thus relieves the 
pain. Ilot oatmeal gruel heats the system quickly and 
thoroughly, for which reason it should be taken freely 
in all cases of colds, neuralgia, and rheumatism. 

Growing-in-Nails. 

When the nails are trimmed cut a deep place in the 
centre of any that have a tendency to grow into the 
flesh. The inclination of the parts of the nail to grow 
together will keep it out of the flesh. 



MEDICINAL. 217 

Nosebleed. 

Roll a piece of soft paper quite hard, and pack hard 
between the upper lip and gum, and in a few minutes 
the bleeding will stop. 

Cure for Hoarseness. 

Bake a lemon or sour orange for twenty minutes in 
a moderate oven ; then open it at one end, and dig out 
the inside, which sweeten with sugar or molasses,, and 
eat. This will cure hoareness and remove pressure from 
the lungs. 

Under the beading of " Medicinal " I do not give any 
rules that will take the place of a physician in cases of 
severe sickness ; but I give simple remedies which have 
been thoroughly tested, and which I hope may relieve 
many others by being thus made public. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

Mock Bisque Soup. — Very nice. 

Stew one can of tomatoes (one quart can). While 
the tomatoes are stewing, put three pints of milk on to 
boil, setting the basin in which the milk is into another 
of hot water. When the milk comes, to a boil, stir in a 
tablespoonful of flour, which has been thoroughly mixed 
with a little cold milk. Let this boil ten minutes, and 
then add butter the size of an egg, salt and pepper to 
taste. The tomatoes, which were put on at the same 
time with the milk, are now ready to strain into the 
mixture. Just before straining, stir a pinch of saleratus 
into the tomatoes to remove the acidity. Serve im- 
mediately. 

Chicken Pillau, — A Southern Dish. 

Cut a chicken into pieces the size you wish to serve 
at table, then wash clean and put into the stewpan 
with about one-eighth of a pound of salt pork, which 
has been cut up into small pieces. Cover this with 
cold water, and boil gently until the chicken begins to 
grow tender, which will be in about one hour, unless 
the chicken is old. Now season the liquor and chicken

with salt and popper, ratlier highly, and add three tea- 
cups of rice, which has been picked and washed, and 
let it boil thirty or forty minutes longer. 

There should be a good quart of liquor in the stew- 
pan when the rice is added. Care must be taken that 
it does not burn. Pork or any other kind of meat can 
be used. 

To Pickle Oysters, 

Two hundred large oysters, one half pint of vinegar, 
one- half pint of white-wine, four spoonfuls of salt, six 
spoonfuls of whole black pepper, and a little mace. 
Strain the liquor, and add the aboved-named ingredi- 
ents, then put on the fire and boil up, and pour while 
boiling hot over the oysters, and let them stand ten 
minutes : then pour the liquor off them and let 
both oysters and liquor get cold ; then put the oysters 
in a jar with the liquor, and cover tight. They will 
keep some time. 

Oatmeal. 

Oatmeal, Indian meal, and hominy all require two 
things to make them perfect : that is, plenty of water 
when first put on to boil, and a long time to boil. 

Have about two quarts of boiling water in a large 
stewpan, and into it stir one cup of oatmeal, which 
you have already wet with cold water ; boil this an 
hour, stirring often, and then add half a spoonful of 
salt and boil an hour longer. If it should get too stiff 



220 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

add more boiling water ; or, if too thin, boil a little 
longer : you cannot boil it too much. 

The only tronble there is in cooking oatmeal is that 
it takes a long time, and surely no one will let that 
stand in the way when it is so much better for having 
the extra time. It is also very necessary that there be 
an abundance of water to begin with ; if not, it will 
never be as good, no matter how much may be added 
after it has been cooking any time. 

Eominy. 

Wash in two waters one cup of hominy, then 6tir it 
into one quart of boiling water with a little salt, and 
boil from thirty to sixty minutes : it is better boiled 
sixty than thirty. Be careful that it does not burn. 
Ilominy can be used more than oatmeal, as it can be 
eaten with any kind of meat, and should be cooked 
once a day. It is nice and appropriate for any meal. 
It is also good eaten warm or cold with milk. 

Hominy Griddle-cakes. 

To one pint of warm, boiled hominy add a pint of 
milk or water, and flour enough to make a thin batter ; 
beat up two or three eggs, and stir them into the bat- 
ter with a little salt. Fry as any other griddle-cake. 
They are delicious. 

Waffles. 

One pint of sifted flour, milk enough to make a thin 



MISCELLANEOUS. 221 

batter, which will be about two thirds of a pint, a small 
piece of butter melted (about a tablespoonful after being 
melted), two egg's beaten very light, a little salt. Mix 
the milk with the flour gradually until it is a smooth 
paste, then the salt and melted butter, and last the well- 
beaten eggs. Have the waffle-irons about as hot as a 
griddle for cakes, and butter them well. Pour in 
enough of the batter to cover the iron, and put the 
other side down gently on it. Let it stand over the fire 
about thirty seconds, and then turn over and let the 
other side remain to the fire the same time, then remove 
and place where they will keep warm until there are 
enough cooked to serve. 

Many persons butter tho waffles as they place them 
on the dish, and others add sugar. It is very well to 
do so if that is known to be the taste of all the family ; 
but it is always safe to let people do those things at the 
table. 

Waffles can be made with batters — given under the 
rules for bread, rice, and Indian griddle-cakes, also 
hominy. 

To£tis Bread. 

Three cups of sweet milk and one of sour, three cups 
of Indian meal and one of fljur, one half-cup of mo- 
lasses, one teaspoonful of saleratus, salt. Steam three 
hours. 

Bread made with Yeast-cakes. 

For two quarts of flour, take one good sized yeast- 



222 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

* 

cake, and break up in one pint of blood-warm waiter ; 
stir until it is thoroughly softened, then from your two 
quarts of flour take enough to make a thin batter, and 
set where it will keep warm for about two hours. If 
the yeast is good, it wi]l be a sponge in that time. 
Now, take the remainder of your flour, and proceed as 
for " Bread No. 2," in the first part of the book, of 
course omitting the flour and water, and using only 
half as much salt and sugar. 

Cake without Eggs. 

Four cups of flour, two of sugar, one and a half of 
boiled milk, one of butter (melted in the milk while 
boiling), one tcaspoonful of cream-tartar, one-half of 
saleratus. Spice to taste. 

Kneaded Plum Cake. 

Two and a half cups of sugar, one-half of butter, one- 
half of sour milk, two spoonfuls of cream, one teaspoon- 
ful of saleratus, one-half of cinnamon, one-half of nut- 
meg, one cup of chopped raisins, and flour enough to 
knead. Roll an inch thick, and cut into oblong pieces. 
Bake on sheets in a quick oven. 

Soft Gingerbread. 

Six teacups of flour, three of molasses, one of cream, 
one of lard or butter, two eggs, one teaspoonful of sal- 
eratus, ginger. Excellent. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 223 

Molasses Pound Cake. 

One quart of molasses, one pint of water, six and a 
half pints of flour, one ounce of soda, one-half of alum, 
one heaping cup of butter, six eggs, one ounce of cin- 
namon, one pound of raisins. Boil the alum in part of 
the pint of water and let cool before mixing it with the 
other ingredients. 

Instead of the alum, one* ounce of cream-tartar may be 
used. 

Hard Gingerbread. 

Very nice. One cup of sugar, one of butter, one- 
third of molasses, one-half of sour milk or cream, one 
teaspoonful of salcratus, one tablespoonful of ginger, 
flour enough to roll. Roll thin, and cut in oblong 
pieces, and bake quickly. Care must be taken that 
there is not too much flour mixed in with the dough. All 
kinds of cakes that are rolled should have no more flour, 
than is absolutely necessary to work it. 

Jumbles. 

Three cups of sugar, two of butter, five of flour, one 
egg^ half a teaspoonful of soda, flavor to taste. Roll 
thin, sprinkle with sugar, and cut with a cutter that 
will take a piece from the centre. Bake in a quick oven. 

Seed Cakes. 
Three-fourths of a pint of sugar, one cup of butter, 



224 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

one quart and half a pint of flour, one teaspoonful of 
saleratus, two eggs, seeds. Roll thin, cut into round 
cakes, and bake quickly. 

Cookies. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, five of flour, one 
teaspoonful of saleratus dissolved in four of milk, one 
egg, flavor to taste. Roll and bake as seed-cakes. 

Shrewsbury Cake. 

Two cups of butter, one pint of sugar, three pints of 
flour, four eggs, one-half a tablespoonful of mace. Roll 
thin, cut into small cakes, and bake in a quick oven. 
There must not be a grain more flour used than what 
is given in the rule. The room that they are made in 
must be rather cool, and they cannot be made in very 
warm weather. They will keep a long time, and are 
perfectly delicious. 

Sponge Busk. 

Two cups of sugar, one of butter, two oj milk, one of 
yeast, three eggs. Rub butter, sugar, and eggs to- 
gether, add milk and yeast and flour enough to make a 
thick batter. Let it stand in a warm place until it is 
light, then add flour enough to make as thick as for 
biscuit, and then shape and put in the pan in whiclj it is 
to be baked, and let it stand two or three hours (three 
hours unless it is very warm weather), and bake in a 
moderate oven about forty minutes. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 225 

It is always best to set the sponge at night, and then 
it will be ready to bake in the forenoon. If you want 
them warm for tea, of course you must set your sponge 
early in the morning. 

Oocoanut Drops. 

Beat the whites of four eggs with half a pint of pow- 
dered sugar, stir with these ingredients one grated co- 
coanut ; bake in small cakes in a moderate oven. 

Prepare the pan for them as for kisses. 

Railroad Cake. 

Two cups of sugar, two of flour, six tablespoonfuls of 
butter, two of milk, six eggs, one teaspoonful of salera- 
tus, two of cream-tartar, lemon peel. Bake in shallow 
pans in a quick oven. 

Kegatta Cake. 

Two pounds of raised dough, one pint of sugar, one 
cup of butter, four eggs, one nutmeg, one glass of wine, 
one teaspoonful of saleratus, one pound of raisins. Mix 
thoroughly, and put in deep pans which have been 
thoroughly greased, and let rise half an hour if very 
warm weather, and three-quarters if in cold weather. Bake 
in a moderate oven. 

Federal Cake. 
On? pint of sugar, one and a half cups of butter, three 



226 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

pints of flour, four eggs, two wineglasses of milk, two 
of wine, two of brandy, one teaspoonful of cream-tartar, 
one half of saleratus, fruit and spice to your taste. 

Bake in deep pans ; the time of baking will depend 
upon how much fruit is used. 

Loaf Cake. 

Two quarts of sugar, seven cups of butter, six quarts 
of sifted flour, six pounds of fruit, one pint of wine, 
one pint of yeast, eight nutmegs, mace, twelve eggs, 
one quart of milk. It may be made at such a time of 
day (being governed by the weather) as will give it 
time to get perfectly light by evening. 

Put in half the butter and half the eggs, the milk, 
flour, and yeast, and beat up thoroughly. In the even- 
ing add the remainder of the butter, rubbing it with the 
sugar, eggs, and spice. 

Let it rise again, until morning ; then add the fruit, 
and put it in deep pans and let rise about half an hour. 

Bake, in a slow oven, from two to three hours. 

Queen's Cake. 

One cup of butter, one pint of sugar, one quart of 
flour, four eggs, half a gill of wine, half of brandy, half 
of thin cream, one pound of fruit, spice to taste. 

Warm the wine, brandy, and cream together, and 
stir quickly into the beaten sugar, butter, and eggs; 
add the fruit the last thing. 

Bake in deep pans in a moderate oren. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 227 



"Wedding Cake. 

Nine cups of butter, five pints of sugar, four quarts 
of flour, sixty eggs, seven pounds of currants, three and 
a half of citron, four of shelled almonds, seven of rais- 
ins, one and a half pints of brandy, two ounces of 
mace To be mixed and baked like wedding cake in 
the first part of the book. This will make eight loaves, 
and will keep for years. 



Black Cake. 

Three cups of butter, one quart of sugar, three pints 
of flour, half a pint of molasses, half a pint of brandy, 
half a pint of wine, one teaspoonful of saleratus, one 
ounce each of all kinds of spice, twelve eggs, three 
pounds of raisins, two of currants, one-half a pound of 
citron. 

Bake in deep pans, in a moderate oven, between three 
and four hours. This is one of the finest rules for rich 
cake in the book. 



Caramel Frosting. 

One cup of brown sugar, and one square of Baker's 
Chocolate scraped fine, one tablcspoonful of water. Sim- 
mer gently, being careful not to let it burn, twenty min- 
utes. Spread on the cake while hot.

228 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

G-lacie Cake. 

Make rich cup-cake and bake in sheets. When nearly 
cold, frost with the following preparation : Wet with 
*old water a small pinch of Cox's Sparkling Gelatine. 
When ready to frost the cake, dissolve this in about 
one-fourth of a wineglass of boiling water, and then thick- 
en with powdered sugar ; flavor with lemon, and spread 
on the cake. This will harden in fifteen or twenty min- 
utes, and cuts nicely the first day, but is not so good to 
keep as that made with the white of egg. 

Golden Frosting. 

Into the yolks of two eggs stir powdered sugar 
enough to thicken, and flavor strong with lemon. This 
does not have as good a flavor as the other kinds, but 
it makes a change. 

Chocolate Pies. 

Make plain cup-cake and bake in Washington-pie 
plates, having the cakes thick enough to split. Split 
them and spread one-half with the following filling, then 
place the top piece on and sprinkle with powdered 
sugar : — 

Pilling for Chocolate Pies. 

One square of Baker's Chocolate, one cup of sugar, 
the yolks of two eggs, and one-third of a cup of boiling 



MISCELLANEOUS. 229 

milk. Mix scraped chocolate and sugar together, then 
add, very slowly, the boiling milk, then the eggs and 
simmer about ten minutes, taking care not to burn the 
mixture. Flavor with vanilla. Have perfectly cold be- 
fore using. The cake must always be fresh. 

Sweet-Potato Pie. 

When the potatoes are dry and mealy, one quart of 
the potato after it has been pared, boiled, and mashed, 
one quart of milk, four eggs, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, 
and sugar to sweeten to taste. Bake the same as pquash 
pics. If the potatoes are very moist, use less milk. 

English Plum Pudding. 

One pound of suet chopped fine, one pint of sugar, 
one pound of stale grated bread, one pound of raisins, 
two of currants, one glass of brandy, two tea?poonfuls 
of ginger, two nutmegs, half a pint of milk, a "little 
salt. Beat well and steam five hours. Serve with rich 
sauce. 

Eve's Pudding. 

Six eggs, six apples, six ounces of bread, six ounces of 
sugar, six ounces of currants ; salt and nutmeg. Boil 
three hours or steam four. Serve with wine sauce. 

Amherst Pudding. 
Three fourths of a cup of butter, three-fourths of a 



230 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

pint of sugar, four eggs, five tablcspoonfuls strained apple 
grated peel and juice of one lemon, nntrticg and rose- 
water, if you like. Bake in a shallow pudding-dish 
which has been lined with rich paste rolled very thin. 
Let it become partly cooled before it is served. 

Carrot Pudding. 

Twenty carrots boiled and strained, two cups of butter, 
one pint of sugar, the yolks of twelve and whites of six 
eggs, one nutmeg, half a pint of wine, one pint of milk. 
Bake like Amherst pudding. 

Down-East Pudding. 

One pint of molasses, one quart of flour, one table- 
spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of soda, three pints of 
blackberries Boil three hours, and serve with sauce 
made in the following manner : — 

One teacup of powdered sugar, one-half of butter, one 
egg, two teaspoonfuls of boiling water, and one of brandy. 
Beat the butter to a cream, and then add very gradu- 
ally the sugar beat in the yolk of the egg, and, when 
perfectly creamy, add the white, which has been beaten 
to a froth, then add the water and stir it very carefully. 
The brandy should be beaten with the butter and sugar. 

Eackel Pudding. 
One quart of bread crumbs, one of apples, cut up very 



MISCELLANEOUS. 231 

fine, half a cup of suet, which has been chopped very 
fine, one cup of English currants, rind and juice of two 
lemons, four eggs well beaten. Mix thoroughly, grease 
a pudding-mould, and put in the mixture. Steam three 
hours. Serve with rich wine sauce. 



Princess Pudding. 

One box of Cox's Sparkling Gelatine. Soak one hour 
in one pint of cold water, and then add one pint 
of boiling water, and one pint of wine, the juice of four 
lemons, and three large cups of sugar. Beat the whites 
of four eggs to a stiff froth, and stir in the jelly when 
it begins to thicken ; pour into a large mould, set in ice- 
water in a cool place, and, when ready to serve, turn out 
as you would jelly, only that you have the pudding in a 
deep dish. 

Make a sauce as for snow pudding, and pour around 
the pudding, or, if you prefer, serve in a separate dish. 
This makes a large pudding : half of it is enough for a 
6mall family. 

Eoyal Cream. 

One quart of milk, one-third of a box of gelatine four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, three eggs, vanilla. Put the 
gelatine into the milk, and let it stand half an hour Beat 
the yolks well with the sugar, and stir into the mi'k. 
Set the kettle into a pan of hot water, and stir until it 
begins to thicken like soft custard. 



252 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Ilave ready the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth ; and, the moment you take the kettle from the 
fire, stir them in quickly, and turn into the moulds. Set 
away in a cold place to harden. 

When you cannot get cream to make Charlotte Russe 
with, this makes a good filling, if you omit the whites 
and fill your moulds when the cream is perfectly cold 
but not yet hardened. 



Eed Grout. 

Take currant juice, and add an equal quantity of 
water. Put it over the fire, and, when boiling, add 
four tablespoonfuls of ground rice, which has been mixed 
with half a cup of cold water, to one quart of the liquid. 
Stir carefully until it thickens, then add sugar enough 
to give it a good flavor. Pour into moulds, and set 
away to cool. To be eaten with sugar and cream the 
same as blancmange. If you have not the ground rice, 
cornstarch will do. 



Cream Pudding Sauce. 

One cup of powdered sugar, one egg, one-third of a 
cup of cream or milk. Beat the white of the egg to 
a stiff froth, then add the yolk and sugar, and beat well. 
Flavor with vanilla, lemon, or wine, and add the cream 
the last thing. This sauce is nice for a light pudding. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 233 

Molasses Candy. 

Two cups of molasses, one of white sugar, one table- 
spoonful of vinegar, a small piece of butter. Boil from 
twenty minutes to half an hour. Try it by dropping a 
little into cold water : if it hardens, it is ready to cool. 
Pour into a flat, buttered dish, and, when cool, work 
it with the hands. 

"Peanut Candy. 

Prepare the same as the above : let boil ten minutes 
longer ; and, just before taking off the fire, add a pint 
of nuts, which have been shelled and broken. 

Pour into the dish ; and, before it becomes perfectly 
cold, cut into pieces. 

Chocolate Candy. 

One cup of molasses, two of sugar, one of milk, one- 
half of chocolate, a piece of butter half the size of an egg. 

Boil the milk and molasses together, scrape the choc- 
olate fine, and mix with just enough of the boiling milk 
and molasses to moisten : rub it perfectly smooth then, 
with the sugar, stir into the boiling liquid, add the 
butter, and boil twenty minutes. Try as molasses candy ; 
and, if it hardens, pour into a buttered dish. Cut the 
same as nut candy. 

Vinegar Candy. 
One cup of vinegar, two of white sugar. Boil until 



2S4 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

it will break brittle when dropped in cold water. Pour 
into a butter-dish, and cut before it gets hard. 

This is nice with nuts for a change. Any kind will 
answer. 

To make Mead. 

One pint and a half of brown sugar, half a pint of 
molasses. Pour on this three pints of boiling water. 
Let this stand until blood warm, then add two ounces 
of tartaric acid and one of essence of sassafras. 

When cold bottle. 

To use Mead. 

Put one tablespoonful of the mead in the bottom of 
a glass, then fill two-thirds full of cold water, then 
stir in one-fourth of a teaspoonful of soda, and drink 
while foaming. 

To make good Soap. 

Ten pounds of potash, eleven of fat, three or four pails 
of boiling water. Pour on and stir until it is dissolved. 
After a few days add boiling water until a proper thick- 
ness. 

Black-Walnut Stain. 

One-fourth of a pound of asphaltum, one-half of bees- 
wax, one gallon of turpentine. If too thin add bees- 
wax ; if too light, asphaltum. Soft pine is the wood 
that stains most readily and prettily. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 235 

Eoast Ham. 

Prepare the ham as for boiling, and if good-sized 
(say ten pounds) boil three hours. Take off the skin 
and place in a baking pan. Let it cook in a moderate 
oven two hours, and serve with champagne sauce. 

With one tablespoonful of butter mix thoroughly one 
tablcspoonful of flour. Set the saucepan on the fire and 
stir constantly until it is a dark brown, then poiir into 
it half a pint of boiling gravy, (the liquor in which 
pieces of green meat have been -boiling until it is very 
rich). Pour the gravy in slowly, and stir slowly and 
constantly. Let it boil up once, season well with pep- 
per and salt, and strain. Add half a cup of champagne 
and serve. 

Vinaigrette Sauce, 

One teaspoonful of white pepper, one of salt, one-half 
of mustard, half a cup of vinegar, one tablcspoonful of 
oil. Mix salt, pepper, and mustard together, then very 
slowly add the vinegar, and after all is well mixed add 
the oil. To be eaten on cold meats or fish. 

Graham Bread. 

Where the bread is liked light like the baker's, this 
is a good rule ; but if the bread be eaten for medici- 
nal purposes the rule in the first part of the book is the 
best. 

Ilalf a cup of yeast, one pint of warm milk or water, 
and flour enough to make a thin batter. Let this rise 



2°6 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

over night and in the morning stir in half a cup of 
sugar, a little salt, one teaspoonful of saleratus dissolved 
in water and Graham enough to make a very stiff bat- 
ter. All the other ingredients should be thoroughly 
beaten into the sponge before adding the Graham, then 
stir in the Graham a little at a time, and beat well. 
Much depends upon the beating. Shape into loaves 
with the hands, and place in the baking-pans. If the 
weather is warm and the sponge is light the loaves 
will be ready to bake in an hour and a half; but if 
not warm it will take longer. The oven should not be 
so hot as for white bread. Bake one hour and a half. 



Graham Muffin. — Very Nice. 

Into a bowl put one and a half pints of Graham, half 
a cup of sugar, and a little salt. Now into the seive 
put half a pint of flour, one teaspoonful of saleratus and 
two of cream tartar. Mis thoroughly with the flour, and 
then sift on to the material in the bowl. Mix all the 
ingredients thoroughly while dry, and then add two 
well beaten eggs and milk enough to make a batter 
that will drop from the spoon readily. Fill the muffin- 
cups about two-thirds full, and bake in a quick oven. 



Eye-Muffins. 
Made the same as Graham. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 237 

Sponge Drops. 

Make cake the same as the first rule for sponge cake 
on page 91. Have the muffin cups very lightly larded, 
and drop a tcaspoonful of the mixture into each cup. 
Bake in a quick oven. These are very nice for a desert 
or for tea. 

Brandied Peaches. 

Weigh your peaches, then throw them a few at a 
time into boiling lye. As soon as the skin begins to 
curl up, drain them and rub the skin smoothly off with 
a cloth, then throw them into cold water. After you 
have finished put them over the fire in boiling water, 
but do not let them boil. When they arc soft enough 
to make a dent in them, take them out to cool. Cover 
them with white brandy, and let them stand twenty- 
four hours, then make a syrup of a pound of sugar to 
a pound of peaches, and mix them. Cover them close, 
and in a few days they will be ready for use. 

Sour-Orange Preserve. 

Grate off the rind and cut the orange into two parts, 
take out all the pulp. Weigh them and place in a 
large stone pot and cover with a brine made from three 
gallons of water and one quart of salt. Let them stand 
in this twenty-four hours and then drain off the brine. 
Cover again with a brine made with the same amount 



238 THE APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

of water and half as much salt as in the first Let 
them stand twenty-four hours again. Now drain again, 
and cover with clear cold water and let them stand 
in this twenty-four hours. Drain again and put into 
a boiler and cover with cold water ; let them come to 
a boil and then boil fifteen minutes ; take them out 
and drain. Make a syrup of sugar (pound for pound), 
and water enough to dissolve. When the syrup is clear, 
drop in the oranges and boil until they arc clear and 
tender, which will be in about four hours of slow boil- 
ing. Great care must be taken that they do not scorch. 
They must be stirred every ten or fifteen minutes. The 
sugar may be either white or brown. The orange used 
is not the common market orange, but the wild, sour 
orange found in Florida. 



Pickled Blueberries. 

Nearly fill a jar with ripe berries, and then fill up 
with good molasses, cover, and set away, and in a few 
weeks they will be ready for use. 



To Blanch Almonds. 

Shell the nuts and pour boiling water over them, let 
them stand in the boiling water a minute, and then 
throw them into cold water. Rub between the hands, 
and the dark skin will come off readily. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 239 

To Sweeten Tainted Meat. 

Cover the meat with sweet milk, and let it stand an 
hour or two, and, unless the meat is very bad, it will 
make it perfectly sweet. Soaking in saleratus water is 
also good. 

To Cleanse New Stove Furniture. 

Boil skim-milk in the pots, kettles, pans, &c., and 
then wash in good soap-suds. 

To Eestore Color to Furniture, etc. 

When the color has been taken out of any thing, that 
is painted, by alcohol, rub the place briskly with a 
piece of flannel and kerosene, and, in a few minutes, it 
will turn dark again. 

Marking Cakes in Gold. 

Bake small round cakes for the children, and, when 
the frosting is hard on them, dip a small brush in the 
yolk of egg, and write the child's name on the cake. 
It pleases the little ones very much to see their names 
in this way. 

Chocolate Caramel. 

Three pounds brown sugar, coarse, one-half pound of 
butter, one-half pound of chocolate scraped fine, one 
pint cream or milk. Melt all these together with care,
