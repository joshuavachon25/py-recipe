This book is dedicated to my daughter, nicknamed Miss 
''Paprika" by our pupils. She has been my inspiration 
and devoted companion through all the years of my 
public life. 

B. H. G. 



TO MY READERS 

An announcement that my lesson for the day would be 
Spanish dishes, invariably brought record-breaking crowds in 
any city in the United States, and a demand for recipes induced 
me to search for the best to be found. 

My three years' stay in California has enabled me to learn 
how to prepare the very best dishes directly from the natives, 
both Mexican and Spanish. 

It is not generally known that Spanish dishes as they are 
known in California are really Mexican Indian dishes. Bread 
made of corn, sauces of chile peppers, jerked beef, tor- 
tillas, enchiladas, etc., are unknown in Spain as native foods; 
though the majority of Spanish people in California are as de- 
voted to peppery dishes as the Mexicans themselves, and as the 
Mexicans speak Spanish, the foods are commonly called Spanish 
dishes. 

When made properly, there is great merit in this class of 
foods and I have endeavored to select the very best recipes, 
and have revised them into correct proportions and practical 
methods of preparation. 

Many of the dishes are very delicious and will be found of 
great value for luncheon, entries, and a zest to various menus, 
and especially useful to those who desire to cater to the public. 
Please note the classification of sauces and dressings which 
eliminates a repetition of the same sauce in different dishes. 

Wishing you as much pleasure in the preparation and serv- 
ing of this collection of recipes as I have had in compiling them, 
I am. Very sincerely yours, 

BERTHA HAFFNER-GINGER.

MEXICAN WOMAN MAKING TORTILLAS 

Y. Y. Perez, Public Bakery, Sonora Town, Los Angeles. They 
refuse to make them any other way and take the same pleasure 
in making a perfectly thin and round tortilla that puffs up 
nicely while cooking, as you and I do in trying to make a beau- 
tiful loaf of bread. Truly the heart of women are the same the 
world over. Deep down, no matter what the environment, the 
desire is always there, to be "loaf givers." 



Tortillas 



Modern Way to Prepare Corn for Tortilla and 

Tamales 

Put one gallon of shelled corn in enough water 
to cover; dissolve one-half cup lime in a little 
water and add to cover; boil fifteen or tw^enty 
minutes; remove from fire, pour off first water 
and add fresh cold water; rub with hand to re- 
move husk. Rinse in another water and it is 
ready to grind. Don't wash too much or it will 
not be pasty enough to make tortilla. 



Tortillas No. 2 

Another way and liked best by some people: 
Add to the corn dough (masa) rounding table- 
spoon of lard to four cups dough, little salt. 



Tortillas No. 3 

Still another wav : Corn meal and coarse flour 
half and half wet to stiff dough, salti and lard. 



44 MEXICAN-SPANISH RECIPES 

Tortillas No. 4 

But the best to my taste is the hominy or corn 
groimd into a smooth paste, three cups corn, one 
of flour, two tablespoons melt^ed lard, teaspoon 
salt, cook on ungreased iron, have read}^ enough 
hot salted lard to dip tortilla in just before you 
add filling to make Enchiladas. When flour is 
used, dough may be rolled out on a board, a small 
pie tin placed on and cut round the edge to form 
cake ; lift up with pancake turner. 



How to Shape Tortillas 

Take piece of dough size of biscuit and press 
Avith hand into cake size of small pie plate, toast 
on top of stove moderately warm. Do not brown.

( 'liilc i)eppers arc the l)a8c of all Me.xieaii and 
Spanish dishes, and I have simplified the various 
recipes by making a list of different ways to 
make the pepper pulps and sauces. Please note 
that they are numbered and named, referred to 
by number and name in the recipes. Original 
way to prepare chile for sauce is to remove seed

seive or colander; add water or tomatoes for 
right consistancy; scalding is the quickest.

Tamales, etc. 

Split red chile pepper, remove all seeds and 
veins, soak several hours in water, pour off, pour 
on boiling water, pour off and repeat again, the 
last water just enough to cover peppers when 
pressed down. Mash in this Avater and press 
through sieve, melt one-half cup pure lard, add 
heaping tablespoon flour, brown and add three 
cups of chile pulp, salt to taste, cook very slowly 
half hour.
