This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the

TO THE DIETITIAN 

AND HER TASK 

THIS BOOK 18 DEDICATED 



55495 



PEEFACE 

To Dietitians and others interested in insti- 
tutional cookery, this book is offered. 

It has been compiled from recipes contributed 
by some seventy dietitians, members of the 
American Dietetic Association, who are actively 
engaged in Institutional, Cafeteria or Tea-room 
work. The recipes are therefore practical and 
workable, and have the merit of individuality. 

Since the needs of different institutions vary, 
the recipes vary. No attempt has been made to 
standardize them except to use level measure- 
ments and to list the ingredients in the order 
in which they should be combined. Each recipe, 
except where it is most evident, is calculated 
in number of servings. 

If the Dietitian finds the book valuable in her 
task of providing proper food for 'her group, 
our aim will have been accompUshed. 

The Chicago Dietetic Association offers 
grateful acknowledgment to the members of 
the American Dietetic Association and other 
friends who so generously responded and made 
the book possible.
