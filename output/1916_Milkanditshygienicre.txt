PREFACE 



THE Medical Research Committee are charged with the administra- 
tion of the Research Fund which has become available under the 
provisions of the National Insurance Act, for the advancement 
of medical knowledge by research. It falls to their duty, there- 
fore, in the application of that Fund, to aid, to initiate, and to 
organise the work of scientific enquiry along available lines of 
advance, towards the enlargement of our powers of preserving 
health and of diminishing disease. 

Among the plans for research which the Committee formulated 
at the beginning of their work, the subject of Milk, in its relations 
to public health, was naturally included. The study of milk is 
from its nature what has been called a 'borderland subject,' and 
has attracted enquiry by workers employing the widely different 
technical methods of chemistry, of physiology, of bacteriology, 
of agricultural science, and of clinical medicine. The results of 
this work have been published separately in the technical archives 
and journals devoted to those special branches of science, and 
these publications are dispersed widely through the literatures 
of many different languages. To the workers in any one field 
the bibliography of his own subject is familiar, or at least easily 
accessible, but in the case of a subject not falling wholly within 
the customary boundaries of a conventional scientific field, it is 
a matter of difficulty involving great expenditure of time and 
labour to secure a general view of the state of knowledge as it 
exists at any given moment, j 

Such a general view, howeyer, of present knowledge and of 
its basis in gathered evidence is a necessary preliminary to the 
proper organisation of fresh researches, and the Medical Research 
Committee accordingly invited Dr. Janet Lane-Claypon, who had 



vi PREFACE 

earlier made valuable reports upon certain portions of the subject 
to the Local Government Board, to assist them in collecting the 
available scientific evidence upon the hygienic relations of milk 
from all the best sources of information, however widely scattered. 
By the courtesy of the Local Government Board, the services 
of Dr. Lane-Claypon were made available for this work, and in 
due time its results were before the Committee. 

It seemed to the Committee that this collection and critical 
summary of the published work upon the subject was likely to 
be valuable to many of those engaged in research work connected 
with it, and no less valuable to those concerned with the administra- 
tive questions which centre round the problems of milk and its 
proper treatment as a food. They have accordingly arranged for 
its publication, and in doing this they have endeavoured to secure 
that it shall be made available at the lowest price compatible 
with efficiency of production. 

It has further been the hope of the Committee that the treat- 
ment of her material by Dr. Lane-Claypon has been such as to 
allow those ignorant of scientific technology to appreciate the 
chief positions which knowledge has gained in this matter, and 
that for this reason the book may have added value in bringing 
the illumination given by scientific work to those who are responsible 
for the formation of public opinion and for the determination of 
administrative action.

MILK 

AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



CHAPTER I 
AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION 

THE hygienic aspect of the milk supply of this country has been 
before the public for some years and has been much discussed. 

Although at first sight the problem may seem to be a simple 
one, its study opens up such a variety of intricate questions, and 
the number of issues arising is so great, that it is difficult to form 
a well-balanced judgment. 

The position is rendered more difficult by the fact that most of 
the research work which has been undertaken in order to elucidate 
the problems of milk, is to be found in foreign periodicals, of 
which only a few are in the English language, the majority being 
in either French or German. Moreover, many of these periodicals 
are difficult of access to readers in this country. 

As a result it has been almost impossible even for the scientific 
worker to obtain a clear view of the position without great ex- 
penditure of both time and labour. 

The primary aim of this book is to present a survey of "the 
existing knowledge upon such aspects of the milk question as 
hitherto has been inaccessible or difficult to obtain by most of 
those desiring it. 

The material which might properly be included under the 
title of the book is so voluminous as to be unwieldy. 
Attention has therefore been concentrated mainly upon those 
branches of the subject which have received less attention 
from other authors. Even with this object in view it was by no 
means easy to decide which of the numerous questions should be 
included in the survey, but, so far as possible, only material directly 
related to the hygienic or nutritional aspects of milk has been 



2 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

considered. Subjects not directly connected with these aspects 
have either been omitted or have been accorded only brief mention. 

It seemed desirable for the sake of clarity to give some 
account of the general composition of the only two varieties of 
milk which are used as a food in considerable quantity in this 
country that is, human and cows' milk. 

It is hoped that the dreariness of the figures giving the average 
composition of milk may have been slightly relieved by a dis- 
cussion of the causes of variation in composition, known at present 
rather to agriculturists than to hygienists. 

The chapters following that on the general composition of 
milk contain, it is believed, material which has not hitherto found 
its way into English text-books. The literature on the subjects 
of these chapters has been given as completely as possible, and the 
so-called ' Biological Properties ' have been dealt with fully. The 
great and wholly unmerited importance which has frequently 
been attached to some of these properties (e.g. the ferments), and 
the general ignorance of the value to the young of the same species, 
of certain other properties of colostrum, appeared to justify the 
devotion to them of considerable space. 

After considering the composition of human and cows' milk as 
fully as appeared to be necessary, it was decided to deal first with the 
supply of human milk under the heading of breast-feeding. Until 
recently much of the most useful knowledge upon this important 
subject had been published in foreign literature. In direct sequence to 
this subject comes the question of the nutritive value of the boiled 
milk of the same species as a food for both infants and calves, and 
this again leads directly to a consideration of the nutritive value of 
the milk (raw and heated) of a foreign species, that is, to the arti- 
ficial feeding of infants and young animals. 

The experimental data upon this important subject have been 
fully dealt with, and opinions or statements unsupported by fact 
have been excluded. 

Details as to the methods of infant feeding have been omitted 
except for an occasional reference, since it is not only outside the 
lines of this work, but also because precise data are so frequently 
lacking in the papers upon this subject. 

It seemed impossible to ignore altogether the question of milk 
production, and of commercial methods of treating milk. These 
have, however, been dealt with as briefly as was felt to be consistent 
with a clear presentment of the subject. 

The great variety of the branches of knowledge which it has 
been necessary to bring under review render it almost impossible 
for any one writer to be personally conversant with them all ; 
this must inevitably lead to some unevenness of treatment, which 
it is hoped may receive the indulgence of the reader. 

The book is intended to appeal both to the expert and to the 
person without technical knowledge. In the endeavour to simplify 



AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION 3 

the subjects, a summary has, on the suggestion of the Committee, 
been prefixed to each chapter. 

These summaries are as far as possible free from technical 
terms, and contain in many cases explanatory notes upon the 
more technical side of the subject-matter of the chapter which 
follows. It is hoped, nevertheless, that the chapters have for 
the most part been so presented as to be intelligible after perusal 
of the summary to those with slight knowledge of the subject. 

A few of the papers referred to in the bibliography have been 
inaccessible, but nearly all have been read by the writer. 

On some questions it is believed that the bibliography relating 
to original work is complete, but this would have been impossible 
to accomplish in regard to those parts of the subject in which 
opinions and discussions form the main literature. Moreover, on 
some questions the literature is too voluminous to permit of a com- 
plete set of references. In such cases the main research papers have 
been referred to, and any research worker can, it is believed, obtain 
full references from an investigation of the works quoted. It may 
perhaps not be out of place to mention the magnificent library 
belonging to the Patent Office, which is especially valuable for 
periodicals dealing with agricultural and ' borderland ' subjects. 

The appendices which have been prepared deal with special 
extensions of the work discussed in some of the chapters It was 
felt that although the subject-matter might be of interest, it was 
hardly of sufficient general importance to include in the chapter 
whose contents corresponded most closely to the appendix in 
question. 

I have pleasure also in acknowledging my indebtedness to the 
Controller of H.M. Stationery Office, by whose kind permission the 
diagrams relating to the work of Prof. Del^pine, Dr. Savage, and of 
myself are reproduced ; also to Prof. Dele*pine, Dr. Savage, Dr. David 
Forsyth, Mr. Wilfred Buckley, and the Liverpool Corporation, for 
permission to reproduce diagrams and plates relating to different 
subjects. 

I am also deeply indebted to Prof. Hewlett and Mr. Reiss, for 
being so kind as to supply me with microscopical slides, from which 
the drawings on the plates of cells and streptococci in milk are taken. 



SUMMARY OF CHAPTER II 

ON THE GENERAL COMPOSITION OF MILK 

ALL classes of mater als which are necessary to maintain life are 
represented in milk. The relative amounts of these vary greatly 
in the milk of different species, and differences are also found in the 
chemical composition of the members of different classes of food- 
stuffs. 

Of the three main classes of food-stuffs, two protein and 
fat are represented in milk by more than one variety of the class. 
These constituents vary in different species, both in the percentage 
amount present and in their chemical composition. 

In considering the chemical composition of milk with any 
degree of accuracy, the milk of each species must be dealt with 
separately. It is proposed here to deal only with human milk 
and with cows' milk, since this latter milk is the most usual form 
of food for children who are unable to obtain human milk or who 
have been weaned. 

Proscher showed many years ago that the milk of each species 
was adjusted so as to contain a suitable proportion of such sub- 
stances as were needed for the young of that species. When the 
young animal was born in a state of relative maturity, the milk 
contained a high proportion of protein and conversely. 

It is difficult to compare the condition of the young of different 
species at birth as regards maturity or immaturity, but the young 
of the human species, especially compared with the calf, can safely 
be regarded as relatively immature at birth. 

In this chapter only the proportions of the classes of food- 
materials will be considered, and the changes in composition 
occurring at different periods of lactation, or from other causes. 

Average Composition of Cows' Milk and of Human Milk. 
It will be shown in the course of this chapter that there is no exact 
standard for the composition of the milk of any species, but it 
will be convenient to consider the average composition of a number 
of samples. The figures given below have been obtained by various 
investigators :

The variations are thus considerable, but, generally speaking, 
cows' milk contains more protein and more salts or ash than human 
milk. Human milk contains much more sugar, while the amount 
of fat is fairly equal. It is probable that in reality the average 
fat content of human milk is higher than that of cows', although 
it is more difficult to obtain a sample of the milk in such a manner 
as to ensure a correct result. It is well known that the milk of 
certain breeds of cows is ' richer ' than others. This term relates 
mainly to the fat content, although some variation also occurs in 
the amount of protein. 

Changes in the Composition of Milk occurring at different 
Stages of Lactation. The milk given by all species of mammalia 
in the early days after parturition is very different in composition 
from that given later. The milk of this period is known as colos- 
trum, and the colostral characteristics persist for different periods 
in different species, and to some extent also in different members of 
the species. 

By the end of the first month, however, the colostral charac- 
teristics have disappeared, and the milk will have the average 
composition, so far as such an average composition of milk exists. 
The most pronounced colostral characters have usually ceased by 
about the fourth or fifth day after parturition. 



MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



Colostrum is a more viscid fluid than the later milk. Some of 
the constituents of milk are present in higher proportion, and cer- 
tain properties are possessed by milk in the early days of lactation 
which are not found later. These are considered in the chapters 
dealing with the constituents or properties concerned. 

The protein and the salt content are higher in colostrum than 
in the later milk. Some observers find that there is rather more 
fat in colostrum than in the later milk, but this appears not to be 
a constant feature. The number of cells found in colostrum is 
frequently higher than in later milk. 

The composition of the colostrum of cows is hardly material 
to the present purpose, as it is not used for infants and is not a 
marketable commodity. Generally, the divergences in composition 
of colostrum from that of average milk are similar to those occurring 
in human milk. 

There is no doubt that colostrum is of primary importance to 
the young animal, and there is no way of replacing it. An infant 
deprived of the colostrum of its mother must endeavour, not always 
with success, to make up later the disadvantage under which it 
has laboured at the start. 

Practical difficulties are encountered in obtaining samples of 
human colostrum for estimation. The infant can usually succeed 
in obtaining an appreciable amount of colostrum before it is possible 
to obtain any artificially, since suckling almost certainly empties 
the gland more completely than is otherwise possible. The differ- 
ences in fat content between the milk at the beginning and end 
of suckling are very considerable, and this renders the estimation 
of the fat of colostrum unreliable. 

The essential differences between colostrum and average milk 
are given below :

Fairly similar figures are given by other authors. 

The figures for the fat content are very variable, which can 
probably be accounted for by the difficulty of obtaining an average 
sample. 

As lactation proceeds changes tend to appear in the composition 
of the milk. In human milk both the protein and the salts tend 
to fall, whereas in cows' milk both tend to rise. It is not unlikely 
that this difference can be accounted for by the fact that cows 



THE GENERAL COMPOSITION OF MILK 7 

kept for milking are usually pregnant during the later months of 
lactation. 

Cows' milk, therefore, does not appear to undergo any loss of 
nutritive value towards the end of lactation, but in women there 
is a tendency for this to occur. 

Milk in Relation to Diet. Much work has been done upon 
this subject, though many of the statements which have been 
made with regard to it are not based upon fact. 

Fundamentally the question is one of the mode of action of the 
mammary gland, and must be considered in relation to the quality 
and quantity of the food, both upon the total amount and upon 
the individual constituents of the milk. 

1. Quantity of Food. When the total amount of food taken 
falls below the minimal daily requirements of the organism, either 
as a whole or in any one of the necessary constituents, the milk 
tends rather to decrease in total amount, than to show a deficit 
of that particular constituent which is supplied in insufficient 
quantity in the diet. 

This is illustrated by the work of Woll, who found that the 
milk of cows which were receiving too short an allowance of food 
decreased in amount. 

Fingerling found that goats receiving a diet in which there was 
too little lime and phosphorus gave less milk until a sufficient 
amount of these substances was restored. 

Any factor acting disadvantageously on the general health or 
economy of the organism tends to produce a fall in the amount of 
milk given. This applies also to the human species. 

2. Addition of Special Substances to the Food. Numerous 
attempts have been made to increase special constituents of the 
milk by giving additional amounts of these constituents in the 
dietary, both of cows and of women. 

One or two observers have claimed a partial success, but the 
most careful observations show that no appreciable increase in 
any one constituent can be obtained by its addition to the food, 
even in large quantities. This has been attempted for fat and 
sugar, and for combinations of lime, iron, and phosphorus. The 
experiments are considered fully in the chapters dealing with these 
constituents. 

The amount of fat produced varies greatly with the same cow 
at different times. 

Variations in the Fat Content. The fat content is low in 
the milk obtained when the gland is full. As milking proceeds, 
the fat content rises and is highest in the end-milk, or strippings. 
In estimating the total percentage of fat in either human or cows' 
milk it is essential that a sample of the milk given in the whole 
period of milking should be taken. 

The fat content also varies within the twenty-four hours, being 
apparently highest towards mid-day. 



MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



CHAPTER II 

THE GENERAL COMPOSITION OF MILK 

A. The Average Composition of Human and Cows' Milk. The 

composition of milk is such a well-worn subject that it would 
not be unreasonable to believe that complete information was 
available. Definite information upon the composition of the milk 
of numerous species is given in many text -books upon milk, and 
this information has been gradually accepted. 

Recent investigations have shown, however, that there is no 
precise composition which can be assigned to the milk of any 
species. A figure giving the average composition of a number 
of samples can be obtained, but a considerable degree of variation 
is exhibited in the figures of the different samples. In addition 
to the divergence in composition due to individual differences in 
the members of the species, great variations occur in several of the 
constituents from other causes. Such causes are the period of 
lactation, the condition of the gland, whether full or nearly empty 
at the time of taking the sample. Further, in cows the breed 
exercises an important influence on the amount of certain consti- 
tuents of the milk. 

Although the composition of milk does not show a constant 
figure, it is useful as a foundation from which to consider the 
variations, which will be referred to later. 

In this chapter only known chemical substances will be con- 
sidered. The less tangible bodies, sometimes known as the ' biolo- 
gical properties,' will be dealt with separately in Chapters V. and VI. 
The cells and the cell content of milk will also be considered later. 

It will be convenient to consider the chemical composition of 
human milk and cows' milk at the same time. The main differences 
in composition of average samples of human and cows' milk respec- 
tively as obtained by various observers for certain of the main 
constituents of the milk are shown below :

THE GENERAL COMPOSITION OF MILK 



In later analyses Meigs and Marsh give the amounts of fat, 
lactose, and protein in the second month of lactation (that is, 
when the colostral period is over and the milk may be considered 
to be of average composition) as follows : 

Fat, from 2-4 per cent., both for human milk and cows' milk. 

Lactose, from 6-7-5 P er cent - f r human and 3'5~5 per cent, for 
milk.

Protein, from o f 7-i'5 per cent, for human and 2'5~4'O per cent, 
for cows' milk.

of human milk are given by the following authors :

before and after the feeding of the infant, and then mixed together, 
so as to secure as far as possible a fair sample, obtained the following 
average figures for human milk :

Fat (27 samples)

Very considerable differences occur in the constituents of the ash

These results show the impossibility of adopting any set of 
figures as a standard for the composition of cows' milk. Doubtless 
some of the extreme figures are attributable to certain causes 
which are considered below. 

The average composition of cows' milk is affected by the breed 
of the cow, although the individual variations which occur between 
the composition of the milk of different cows of the same breed are 
sometimes as great as those which may reasonably be attributed to the 
breed of the cow. Eckles and Roscoe Shaw studied in detail the effect 
of breed on the percentage of the main constituents. The food 
ration was kept constant, and samples were taken over practically 
the whole period of lactation. The same series of investigations 
was also available to show the variations in composition due to the 
stage of lactation and to the individual cow. These latter results 
will be considered later. 

Samples of the daily milk were preserved with formalin, and 
the estimations carried out once a week. It is impossible here 
to attempt to reproduce more than a few of the figures obtained 
by these investigators. The following table gives a summary 
of the variations in the composition of milk in Jerseys, Holsteins, 
and Shorthorns, there being three cows in each series :

Very considerable variations occur, more especially in the fat 
samples, even when the average estimations are in four-weekly 
periods. In the Holsteins the fat content was below 3 per cent, 
and above 5 per cent, in the Jerseys in several averages. 



THE GENERAL COMPOSITION OF MILK 



ii 



Sugar appears to have a remarkably constant percentage both 
among different breeds and among individuals of the breed. 

The authors carried out numerous researches into the nature of 
the fat, and concluded that no variations occurred in the melting- 
point of the fat which could be attributed to the breed of the cow. 

Eckles has shown that yearly variations occur in the amount 
of fat in cows' milk. 

It would appear that there are no data as to the differences 
in composition of human milk, as a result of difference of race, 
although such differences may quite likely exist. 

B. Variations in Composition due to the Period of Lactation. 

It is well known that the milk given in the early days after 
parturition is different in quality from the milk of later periods ; 
also that alterations occur upon the approach of cessation of 
lactation, and owing to disease. 

All these points require consideration, and it will be convenient 
to consider first of all the general trend of the changes occurring 
as the period of lactation passes on ; then to consider the special 
composition of the milk in the early days after parturition. The 
question of disease will be dealt with briefly. 

The alterations in special constituents of the ash due to the 
period of lactation will be dealt with under the appropriate headings. 

Human Milk. Comprehensive investigations were made by 
Pfeiffer in 1895 and by Schlossmann in 1900 upon the alterations in 
human milk due to the period of lactation. Pfeiffer's figures are

The figures in these tables show that there is a general tend- 
ency for the amount of nitrogen to fall during lactation. The 
figures for fat and sugar, although showing some variations, do 
not exhibit any decided alteration in relation to the period after 
parturition. 

Bamberg, in the course of other investigations, found the 
same tendency for the nitrogen content to fall during lactation. 

Towards the end of lactation certain properties of the early 
period tend to reappear, but as these do not appreciably affect 
the chemical composition of the milk, they will not be considered 
in this chapter (see Chap. VI.). 

Cows' Milk. Eckles and Roscoe Shaw obtained elaborate 
data as to the effect of the stage of lactation upon the milk 
of cows. The estimations were commenced approximately one 
month after parturition except in one case Jersey cow (c) 
where the first sample was taken later. . The figures given are too 
numerous to quote, and it has been necessary for the present pur- 
pose to take only the first and last four-weekly averages of the 
estimations obtained for the more important constituents. These 
are given on p. 13. 

The intermediate figures, which are not given here, show a slight 
drop in the nitrogen figures in the early months of lactation, followed 
by a corresponding rise towards the cessation of the function. 
Eckles and Shaw also compared the total amount of milk given 

1 This second figure is obtained if the results given by the milk of three 
women in whom lactation had nearly ceased, are omitted.

the results graphically. One of these diagrams is given on p. 14.

of lactation and the accompanying rise in certain of the con-

tendency to a rise in the total nitrogen is the reverse of that found

tion of this apparent divergence may be found in the fact that

The milk yield in pounds is shown by the plain line falling gradually 
throughout the period of lactation. 

The curves showing the changes in composition are arranged to show the 
percentage rise or fall above the average percentage for each constituent, 
which is represented by the zero line. 

these cows were all pregnant in the later months of lactation. 
Samples taken from five cows who were farrow showed little 
alteration in the constituents of the milk taken at the same 



THE GENERAL COMPOSITION OF MILK 15 

periods after parturition. It is possible that the mammary gland 
may act to a slight extent as an excretory organ, when there is 
a surplus of waste substances circulating in the blood stream. 1 
This condition will be the case in the later months of pregnancy 
at all events, and probably occurs in the early months. In this 
case the slight rise in nitrogen may be partly, if not wholly, 
accounted for. It would appear that no observations upon the 
metabolism of pregnant cows are available. Investigations upon 
the metabolism of pregnancy and lactation have been carried out 
upon women by Mellanby, and upon dogs by Murlin and by Dienes. 
For further details and additional literature, reference should be 
made to these authors. Detailed discussion of this subject is 
outside the scope of the present work. 

Medical literature contains much discussion upon the desira- 
bility or otherwise of weaning an infant should pregnancy super- 
vene. The general opinion appears to tend in the direction that 
weaning is not necessary unless the health of the mother should 
require it. 

The practical side of the question may be regarded as having 
been settled long ago by farmers, since the very great majority of 
cows which provide the milk-supply of the country are allowed to 
become pregnant usually within a few weeks (sometimes rather 
later) of parturition. 

The rise in the non-fatty solids may perhaps be accounted for 
by the same suggestion as in the case of the rise of nitrogen. 

The sugar content is extremely constant throughout the whole 
period of lactation. 

The increase in the fat is so slight that in view of the general 
wide variations in fat content, it hardly calls for discussion. 

The ash content of cows' milk in relation to the period of lacta- 
tion was exhaustively examined by Trunz in two cows. He found 
that no definite alterations in the salt content could be detected, 
although generally there was a slight fall in the first weeks, which 
rose again towards the end of the tenth month. 

Variations in the composition of milk in relation to the amount 
of milk given will be considered in dealing with the individual 
constituents. 

C. Composition of Milk in the Early Days after Parturition (Colos- 
trum). The value of colostrum to the young animal of the same 
species would appear to be very great. Naturally-fed infants and 
calves each receive the colostrum of their own species, but the 
colostrum of the cow is not a marketable product, and, as far as 
I am aware, there is no record of its having been supplied to infants 
as a food. 

The composition of colostrum is, however, a matter of con- 
siderable intrinsic interest, and a brief digression upon this subject 

1 Cp. Engel and Murschhauser, p. 42. 



1 6 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

will not be out of place. Only the chemical constituents will be 
considered in this chapter. 

The colostrum of the cow appears to show the same type of 
change from the average sample as in the human species. As it is 
not used for infants, it will be sufficient to quote a few figures, 
confining the discussion more definitely to the composition of 
human colostrum. 

Konig gives the following figures for the percentage composition 
of cows' colostrum : 

Per cent.

Caseinogen . . . . . . 4-19 

Albumin and globulin .... 12*99 

Fat 3-97 

Lactose ...... 2*28 

Ash 1-53 

The protein figures are of especial interest if they are compared 
with the work on the biological aspect of the milk-proteins which 
is considered later. 

Engel and Dennemark investigated the milk of three cows. 
They found that the physical characteristics of colostrum were 
most marked in the first three days, and during this period marked 
differences in the distribution of the nitrogen occurred. If milk 
fever supervened, the peculiar distribution of nitrogen was main- 
tained over a longer period. 

These authors give the following figures :

The figures given by Sassenhagen for the fat content of colostrum 
show variations extending between i-i per cent, and 3-6 per cent. 
in one case 7-8 per cent. The fat estimations were only an incidental 
part of the work, and it is not advisable to lay any stress upon 
them, as it is not stated that the samples were average mixed 
samples. Taken with the figures already given, they show, however, 
that the fat content of colostrum does not appear to exceed that 
of the later milk, and that it is equally, if not more, variable. 

Capobianco, who deals fully with the literature upon this 
matter, finds that the osmotic pressure of colostrum is above the 
figure usually given for average milk. 



THE GENERAL COMPOSITION OF MILK 17 

Human Colostrum. The estimation of the composition of 
human colostrum is rendered difficult in view of the relatively 
small amount which is present in the gland. It is not possible 
to obtain more than a small fraction of the total amount of milk 
produced, for purposes of analysis. The gland is not in working 
order, expression of milk is painful, and the breast-pump, at all 
times an insufficient method of obtaining the end milk, is of little 
assistance at this juncture. It is probable that the infant obtains 
a good deal more milk than can possibly be removed by artificial 
means ; further, as the end milk is the richest in fat, it is almost 
certain that the food value available for the infant will exceed 
that suggested by the published estimates of the average composi- 
tion of colostrum. Langstein, Rott, and Edelstein say that in 
their experiments the child was usually able to obtain 10 to 15 
grammes of milk at a period when it was impossible for any to 
be expressed for estimation. 

The following figures are given by Camerer and Soldner (i) for 
the values of colostrum :

The extreme variation in the last three sets of figures, especially 
in the fat, raises a doubt whether the specimens were really average

some difficulty in obtaining samples. The method employed is

The total ash is much higher in colostrum than in later milk, 
and the most striking differences lie in the sodium and phosphorus 
content. 

The main chemical differences between colostrum and later 
milk appear to consist in the increased content of nitrogen and 
certain constituents of the ash. Fat and sugar are little, if at all, 
higher than in later milk, and may be lower. 1 

The value of colostrum as a food for the new-born child is a 
question of great interest. The loss of weight which occurs in 
infants after birth has been investigated by numerous observers, 
with more or less satisfactory results. The cause of the loss does 
not appear at all certain, and the investigation of the food value of 
colostrum was a necessary step towards attainment of knowledge 
upon this point. 

The problem essentially resolves itself into the two con- 
siderations : 

1. Does the loss of weight denote an insufficient amount of 
nourishment in the food ? 

2. Is it due to loss of fluid or of waste material ? Must it in 
any case be regarded as detrimental, or not ? 

In order to obtain an answer to the first part of the problem 
investigations have been made as to the food requirements of 
a new-born child. Many difficulties are encountered in this work. 

1 Cp. Pfeiffer's figures on p. n for first and second days after parturition. 



THE GENERAL COMPOSITION OF MILK 



The heat value of the food taken can only be ascertained approxi- 
mately, owing to the difficulty of obtaining all the colostrum 
except by suckling, and to the fact that the colostrum cannot be 
used both for estimation and as a food for the infant. 

Langstein, Rott, and Edelstein endeavoured to avoid some of 
these difficulties by expressing some milk before and after feeding, 
and mixing the samples thus obtained. If the total amount of 
milk available is known and the heat value of an average sample 
is ascertained, a reasonable approximation may be arrived at as 
to the calories available for the infant. 

Langstein and his colleagues took samples from eight cases, 
and concluded that all colostrum did not have the same heat 
value. They divided the results obtained into two classes, of 
which the heat value per litre of milk for Group I. (of rich colostrum) 
is given as :

In Group II. (poor colostrum) there was little difference in 
caloric value as compared with that of the later days. 

Birk studied the metabolism of two children, one of whom 
was fed naturally from birth, with colostrum passing to later 
milk, while the other received no colostrum, but was fed by a 
wet-nurse in a later stage of lactation. Although the first child 
lost weight in the usual way, it showed a positive balance for 
nitrogen and salts ; the other child showed a negative balance for 
nitrogen and several saline constituents, viz. :

The percentage retention of the salts is interesting, and the 

c 2 



20 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

figures show the loss suffered by the infant when deprived of 
colostrum. 

It seems doubtful whether the loss in total weight is detrimental 
when the weight begins to rise again within a few days after birth. 
Griffith and Gittings found that the loss of weight after birth could 
be prevented by giving the child additional human milk during 
the first day or two, but that after a few weeks no advantage 
could be detected in these infants over those in whom loss of weight 
had been allowed to occur. 

Murlin and Bailey concluded that there was not enough food 
value in colostrum. The calculation upon which this conclusion 
is based is not clear, but it is not material for the present purpose. 
Having decided that nature was a delinquent in regard to the pro- 
vision of food for the early days of an infant's life, these observers 
prepared percentage feeds of cows' milk to supplement the de- 
ficiency. They found that ' supplementary feeding of new-born 
infants from the first day forward with a formula somewhat 
resembling colostrum in composition, diminished the initial loss 
of weight, accelerated the return to birth weight, and had no 
unfavourable effects.' It is not stated which of the three advan- 
tages is considered the greatest possibly the last. 

A full resume of the literature upon the loss of weight in the 
early days of life is given by Pies. 

Further questions relating to colostrum are dealt with in 
Chapters III. and VI. 

D. The Influence of Diet. The investigations and results which 
have been detailed above, lead without further observation to the 
conclusion, that the composition of the milk is independent of the 
constituents of the food within very wide limits. 

Carlyle and Woll show that to some extent the fat production 
appears to vary independently of the amount of food. 

Thus in one cow (Bessie) as compared with another cow (Dolly), 
it was found that : 

Bessie, in 1900-1901, produced 42-64 Ibs. of butter-fat more 
than in 1899-1900, but her food cost $5.42 less than in 
that year. 

Dolly, in the year 1899-1900, produced 302 Ibs. of butter-fat 
against 98 Ibs. in the preceding year, and her food cost 
$1.1 less. 

The experiments carried out by Woll with what was found to 
be an insufficient supply of food, showed an appreciable fall in 
the total milk produced, but the fat-ratio appeared to be little 
affected, although the total fat fell. 

Woll quotes figures from Holtsmark to show that up to a 
certain point an increase in the amount of milk can be obtained 
by increasing the food-supply of cows, as shown by the following 
figures :

The increase in the amount of milk produced may evidently 
cease to be profitable to the farmer, owing to the greater cost of 
the food required to produce it. 

Koning found that poor food caused a fall in the fat-content and 
in the ' solids not fat.' The addition of even 200 gms. of sodium 
chloride to the food gave no increase of chlorides in the milk. 

Kohn showed that a somewhat higher fat-content was obtained 
when goats were partly fed on the meadows, instead of with dried 
food only. The ash also rose somewhat with meadow feeding. 

Engel and Plaut found that the milk of a nursing woman is 
reduced if there is insufficient fat in the diet, but that increasing 
the fat in the food did not increase the fat in the milk. 

Allemann endeavoured to alter the composition of the milk 
by alteration in the food given, but without success. The addition 
of large quantities of salt to the food was not successful in causing a 
rise of salt-content in the milk. When, however, saltpetre was used 
in large quantities, traces of this could be detected in the milk. The 
fact that traces of the abnormal salt were found in the milk is of 
interest in connection with the work of Engel and Murschhauser. 1 

When certain important constituents of the food fall below 
the physiological limit, the amount of milk secreted is reduced. 
This would appear to be due to a physiological mechanism, designed 
to prevent undue depletion of the organism. 

Thus Fingerling found that when goats were fed on a diet 
poor in calcium and phosphorus, a fall both in the amount of the 
constituents and of the total milk occurred. This drop commenced 
when a certain degree of depletion had been reached consequent 
on the reduction in intake of these constituents. On restoring the 
calcium and phosphorus the secretion returned to normal. 

Cathcart and Paton, in the course of experiments undertaken to 
determine the source of lactose in milk, fed a goat on a diet calcu- 
lated to reduce the carbohydrate taken, and administered phloridzin 
to remove the store of glycogen. The amount of milk given fell 
very rapidly also the ash-content but in two instances the fat- 
content rose. At one period the secretion of milk almost stopped. 

1 See p. 42,

MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



The addition of salts to the food, with the view of increasing 
the output of a particular constituent, has been frequently 
attempted, but with no appreciable success, although some 
observers claim to have produced an effect. These will be dealt 
with under their several headings in Chap. IV. 

Attempts have also been made to determine some degree of 
correlation between the various constituents of the milk. Thus, 
Schloss believes that there is a relationship between the nitrogen 
and the ash. Bamberg, however, finds none. Engel finds a 
relationship between the amount of milk and the fat ; this is 
denied by Helbich (2) . So far no distinct relationship between any 
of the constituents has been shown to exist, although this may 
obtain in a few isolated cases. 

. Differences in Composition in Milk at Different Stages 
of Emptying the Gland. Agriculturists have long been aware of 
the great rise in fat-content which occurs towards the end of 
milking. It is entirely unnecessary to quote numerous authors in 
support of this, but it may be of interest to mention a few. (The 
last portion of the milk is known as the 'strippings,' the first 
portion as ' first milk,' while the rest is termed ' middle milk.') 

Jensen, in the course of experiments conducted for another 
purpose, gives the following figures :

Similar results were obtained by Wellmann on calves. He 
inserted a tube in the side of the oesophagus of a calf and took 
samples of the milk obtained by the calf from the gland. 

The calf did not appear to be inconvenienced by the tube after 
the first day or so. Four sets of estimations were made with 
varying intervals between the feeds. Alternate half-litres were

The figures need no comment. They show the futility of fat 
estimation unless a mixed sample of all the milk secreted at one 
time is obtained, and the great importance from a nutritive stand- 
point that the infant should obtain the end milk in the gland ; 
otherwise it loses much of the fat. 

F. The Composition of Milk in Relation to Amount of Milk 
Produced. The constancy in the percentage of certain constituents of 
the milk, which has already been shown to be the case, suggests that 
no fixed amount of these substances is secreted in the twenty-four 
hours, but that the daily output varies roughly with the total milk 
produced. Special attention has been devoted to this point by 
Bamberg, who found that the differences in composition of human 
milk were due to the individual women, and did not arise from 
the secretion of varying amounts of milk. This holds good even 
with a greatly increased milk production. 

Bamberg took samples before and after the child had been 
fed, so as to obtain a medium sample. The analysis of a number 
of samples showed that the percentage amount of protein, sugar, 
and total ash are all independent of the amount of milk produced. 
Bamberg also includes fat in the list, but this is not in accordance 
with results obtained by other observers. 1 

G. The Effect of Different Intervals of Milking. The effect 
produced on the amount of milk given by a wet-nurse by altering 
the intervals of feeding, was studied by Helbich (2), and is dealt 
with in Chap. VIII- 

Eckles and Shaw (3) carried out a study of the alterations in 
composition of cows' milk due to a change in the intervals of 
milking, and obtained the figures shown on p. 25. 

It is usually believed that the low fat-content frequently found 
in the morning milk of cows is due to the longer interval elapsing 
between the evening and morning, than between the morning and 
evening milking. Eckles and Shaw's (3) figures, however, show 
considerable variations in fat-content where, as throughout these 

1 Cp. below, pp. 42-43, on variation in fat-contents. 



THE GENERAL COMPOSITION OF MILK 



studies, the length of interval is kept constant. This is referred 
to in considering the fat-content alone. 1 

Variations in the Fat-content during the Twenty-jour Hours. 
The work of Eckles and Shaw (3) in relation to the intervals of milking 
shows that the fat- content was highest in the 10 A.M. milking, and 
these authors state generally that the fat-content was usually 
highest about midday. 

This appears to be also the case for the human species. Helbich (2) 
took careful analyses of mixed samples of milk obtained from a 

Milking Twice Daily.

an eight-hourly interval at night. The results of one of the sets 
of experiments are shown in the diagram given on p. 26. 

The fat-content was in each case highest at 10 A.M. in this 
experiment, but in several of the others it was highest at 2 P.M., 
while the milk yield was greatest at the first feed i.e. after an 
eight-hourly interval. 

The results of these investigations are very interesting, but 
no explanation can as yet be given.

different intervals of feeding.

MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



H. Notes on the Chemical Composition of Milk as Affected by possible 
Disease of the Gland. The work of several of the investigators 
already quoted has shown that a deficiency of nutriment or other 
unsatisfactory condition of health may lead to a diminution either in 
the total milk supply or, under certain circumstances, to the decrease 
in certain constituents of the milk, usually, however, the former. 

The work of several observers who were considering the possible 

Diagram showing the Amount of Milk and the Fat-content of each Feed on 
eight consecutive days. (After Helbich.) 1 



700 




The shaded part represents the amount of milk given, and the dotted 
line the percentage of fat, on each occasion. The intervals were four-hourly 
during the day, with an eight-hour one at night: 

disease of one or more quarters of the udder, shows that circum- 
stances may arise in which the milk from one quarter may show a 
marked decrease in the amount of lactose accompanied by an increase 
in the nitrogen, and possibly alterations in the other constituents. 

Thus Hewlett, Revis, and Villar in 1910, in the course of investi- 
gations carried out upon the cellular content of milk, showed that 
in a number of cases where a high cell-content was obtained, there 
was an abnormally low content of lactose. This was sometimes 
accompanied by an increase in the total protein present. In 

1 See p. 25. 



THE GENERAL COMPOSITION OF MILK 27 

several of such instances no disease or unsatisfactory condition 
of the quarter of the udder could be detected clinically. 

Seel, in 1911, analysed the milk from thirty-four cows where 
one or more quarters of the udder were inflamed. He found 
certain differences between the milk of the abnormal quarter, 
and also showed that the milk, even from the apparently healthy 
quarters, showed similar differences. The chief alterations which 
occurred were a marked reduction in the amount of lactose present, 
as also in the chlorides. There was usually a reduction of fat in the 
affected quarter, while the fat-content of the healthy quarters of 
the same udder showed a tendency to rise. There was also a 
general rise in the albumen-content from all the quarters, and some 
rise in the phosphorus-content in the milk secreted by the apparently 
healthy parts. 

In cases of cows definitely suffering from mastitis there appeared 
to be some rise in the total ash-content. No constant divergence 
between the normal and abnormal quarters of the udder was, 
however, obtained. Seel considers these differences sufficiently 
important to be of use in aiding diagnosis of disease of the udder. 

The alterations in composition of the milk arising from definite 
disease of the gland is not pertinent to the present discussion. 
When disease is well established, it can usually be detected in the 
altered appearance of the milk. Such milk should not be used 
as a food, but should be discarded.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER III 

ON THE ORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 

i. The Proteins. The amount of protein present in milk varies 
with different species. The protein-content of cows milk is from 
two to two and a half times as great as that of human milk. 

Two proteins (possibly three) are found in milk caseinogen and 
lact-albumin. Small amounts of lacto-globulin are probably also 
found. The separation of caseinogen and lact-albumin from 
milk can be accomplished without difficulty. Caseinogen is pre- 
cipitated by acetic acid, or by half saturation with ammonium 
sulphate, and by other reagents which do not affect the albumin. 
The separation of caseinogen and of a possible lacto-globulin is 
more difficult, since caseinogen partakes of the nature of a globulin, 
and tends therefore to be precipitated by the same reagents. Those 
investigators who have used chemical methods have differed in their 
views as to the presence of a true globulin, mainly on these grounds. 

Later work undertaken with biological methods renders it 
fairly certain that this third protein is present in milk, although 
in small quantities. From a nutritional standpoint it can almost 
certainly be neglected, but biologically it is probably of considerable 
importance. 

The term ' whey-protein ' is frequently applied to the protein 
of milk apart from caseinogen. This term will include the lact- 
albumin and the globulin, since caseinogen alone is affected by 
the curdling with rennet. 

The excess of protein in cows' milk over human milk is mainly 
due to the larger amount of caseinogen. Lact-albumin appears 
to be present in human milk in rather larger amount than in 
cows' milk, although the absolute amount is less than that of the 
caseinogen. 

Caseinogen contains a good deal of phosphorus, and is combined 
also with calcium. Lact-albumin is stated to contain a higher 
percentage of sulphur than caseinogen. Slight differences in 
composition are obtained between the caseinogen of cows' milk 
and that of human milk. 

There is no reason to suppose that the proteins of cows' milk 

30 



THE ORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 31 

differ sufficiently from those of human milk to be the detrimental 
factor in artificial feeding at least after the early days of life. 1 

The Biological Relationship of the Milk-proteins. The relation- 
ship of proteins is difficult, if not impossible, to establish by chemical 
methods, but the methods which have been discovered by workers 
on immunity enable much accurate information upon this point 
to be obtained. 

Three methods have been used in establishing the relationship 
of the milk-proteins. 

1. The precipitin method. 

2. The method of complement deviation. 

3. Anaphy lactic methods. 

The precipitin method is based upon the fact that if a foreign 
protein is injected into an animal, the organism reacts and forms a 
substance capable of precipitating further amounts of the original 
protein injected. 

For instance, when milk or when solutions of the different 
proteins of milk or of blood are injected into an animal of another 
species the tissues of that animal respond to the invasion of the 
foreign substance by producing another substance which is capable 
of precipitating or throwing out of solution the invading or injected 
protein. The precipitation of the foreign substance renders it 
harmless to the organism, and is the method employed by the body 
to protect itself against the invasion of proteins which do not 
harmonise with those of the animal concerned. If the blood of 
an animal which has been injected with milk or milk proteins is 
collected, the serum thus obtained has the power, when mixed 
with a solution of the proteins which were injected, of precipitating 
these proteins. The reaction thus obtained is visible to the naked 
eye, and when the precipitate is formed it is known that special 
substances (precipitins) have been present in the serum. More- 
over, it has been shown that these precipitins are capable not only 
of throwing out of solution the substances (antigens) as a result of 
whose injection the precipitin was formed, but they can also precipi- 
tate, at least partially, the proteins in the blood or milk of animals 
having a near relationship. In fact, the strength of the reaction 
affords proof of the nearness or otherwise of the inter-relationship 
of different classes of animals. 

The application of this method has shown (i) that the proteins 
of human and cows' milk are biologically dissimilar, so that the 
milk proteins must be regarded as 'foreign ' for the human infant ; 
(2) that in both cows' milk and human milk caseinogen and lact- 
albumin are separate bodies, since a caseinogen-anti-serum will 
not react fully with lact-albumin, and vice versa ; and (3) that the 
albumin of milk and the albumin of the blood are biologically 
identical, in both cows and women. 

1 Cp. Chap. VI. for work on this latter point. 



32 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

The principle of the method of complement deviation is some- 
what elaborate and more sensitive. It has been used mainly by 
Bauer working alone and with Engel. These authors have con- 
firmed and extended the results obtained by the precipitin methods. 
Further, it has been shown (i) that both human and cows' milk 
contain lacto -globulin, more being present in human milk than in 
cows' milk. Although present only in small amounts, this body 
acts as a powerful exciter of reactions when injected into the body. 

(2) That the albumin and the globulin in the milk of both species 
are biologically identical with those bodies in the blood of that 
species. 

(3) That albumin and globulin are more closely related to one 
another than to caseinogen. 

(4) That caseinogen is, however, more closely related to globulin 
than to albumin. 

Confirmatory although less extensive results have been obtained 
by the third method, that of anaphylaxis. 

The Proteins of Colostrum. The protein content of colostrum is 
higher than that of the later milk. The above methods have 
been used to show that the proteins of colostrum and of later milk 
are identical, and that the albumin and globulin of milk are identical 
with these bodies in the blood. There is some uncertainty as to 
whether the caseinogen or the whey-protein (albumin and globulin) 
predominates. Probably both are present in greater amount than 
in later milk, but the whey-protein is further increased relatively to 
the caseinogen. 

The identity of the proteins of the blood and of whey, which has 
been shown by the above methods, raises important questions. It 
is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the proteins of whey are 
derived directly from the blood by filtration. Caseinogen, however, 
must be formed by the gland, either by a modification of the blood- 
protein or it must be derived from the gland cells. 

Bauereisen points out, and this has also been shown by other 
authors, that we must regard the colostral period as being the 
transition stage for the infant from that period when it was nourished 
directly by the blood of its mother, to the subsequent period when 
it depends upon its own alimentary tract for nourishment. The 
protein constituents of whey and of blood are practically identical : 
the method of administration constitutes the main difference. In 
the transition period, extending immediately after birth up to the 
end of the colostral period, that is, probably until about the fourth 
or fifth day (when the colostral characteristics cease to be marked), 
a different mechanism of absorption appears to be employed by 
nature. This method has for its object the tiding over of the 
infant from the intrauterine period to the period when it is dependent 
upon its own digestive juices, and it seems that the proteins of the 
colostrum can be absorbed by the infant from its alimentary canal 
without undergoing any marked changes, whereas later, after the 



THE ORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 33 

colostral period, the proteins must be broken down, and the products 
thus obtained be absorbed by the infant. It is difficult to afford 
a direct proof of this statement, but indirect and convincing proof 
is afforded by the fact that the mechanism which is concerned 
with the production of immunity appears to be intimately attached 
to the protein constituents of the blood. It will be shown more 
fully in another chapter that these properties are present in the 
milk, presumably attached to the proteins, and that during the 
early days they can be transferred to the infant and can be found 
in the infant's circulation. Had the proteins been subjected to 
digestion along ordinary lines, the properties connected with 
immunity would almost certainly have been destroyed. Hence 
the assumption that these substances have been absorbed directly 
into the infant's body. This absorption does not, however, take 
place after the first few days of life. 

2. On the Pats of Milk. The percentage of fat in milk has 
been considered in the preceding chapter. The composition of 
fat in the milk of different species varies considerably, being com- 
posed of different fatty acids. It would not appear necessary to 
enter upon these differences in composition, since no evidence has 
been adduced which renders it of importance from the nutritional 
standpoint, and the investigations upon the subject are not numerous. 
The amount of fat given has been shown to vary considerably in 
the twenty-four hours. 

3. Sugar. The carbohydrate found in milk is lactose. This 
substance is present in greater amount in human milk than in 
cows' milk. 



CHAPTER III 

THE ORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 

IN the preceding chapter the different classes of chemical sub- 
stances present in milk have been considered as a whole. This 
general aspect is, however, not sufficiently precise for the present 
purpose, and it will be necessary to devote attention to the in- 
dividual organic and inorganic substances comprised in the general 
classes. The organic substances fall into the three main classes 
of food-stuffs proteins, carbohydrates, and fats and will be dealt 
with in the present chapter under these headings, the inorganic 
constituents being considered in the following chapter. 

i. The Proteins and Nitrogen-containing Substances. The 
discovery of methods for the separation of the proteins of blood 
and of egg-white were applied to milk by various observers. An 
account of the development of this line of research is given by 



34 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

Schryver, to whose book reference should be made for additional 
information. 

It was found that such separation could be effected by the 
addition of salts, certain proteins falling out of solution with 
different salts or with a different concentration of the salt. The 
two main classes of protein obtained by this means are termed 
globulin and albumin, the globulin being the more easily pre- 
cipitated. 

The application of these methods to milk showed that at least 
two proteins were present in this fluid. Of these two bodies one 
was found to belong to the globulin and the other to the albumin 
group. These substances are known as caseinogen and lact- 
albumin. Caseinogen is not a true globulin, although it has certain 
of the properties of the substances of this class. It contains 
phosphorus, and is probably present in milk as caseinogenate of 
calcium. 1 

When milk is clotted by means of rennet, caseinogen becomes 
altered and is known as casein. Caseinogen can be removed 
from milk by various methods, leaving the rest of the protein in 
solution. 

Hammarsten thought that a true globulin substance (lacto- 
globulin) was present in milk in addition to caseinogen, and other 
investigators have agreed with him. Sebelien (1885) found that 
a precipitation of lacto-globulin could be obtained when Ham- 
marsten 's method was used, but he gives reasons for doubting 
whether this can be regarded as a separate substance of globulin 
type. Halliburton was unable to obtain any evidence of the 
presence of lacto-globulin. 

It is impossible here to consider fully the literature upon this 
question, but it seems likely that a third protein body (of globulin 
type) is present in milk ; normally, however, it occurs in very small 
quantities. More recently the application of biological methods has 
appeared to confirm this view, and the amount of lacto-globulin 
in colostrum appears to be appreciable. 

The small amounts of this substance which have been found 
in milk render it of comparatively minor importance from the 
nutritional standpoint, and it is very commonly classed with 
lact-albumin under the term ' whey -protein.' This term includes 
the proteins other than caseinogen, which alone of the proteins 
present in milk is coagulated by the action of rennet. 

On the Amount of Caseinogen and Lact-albumin in Milk. 
The amount of caseinogen present in cows' milk is much greater 
than that in human milk, and the higher total protein content of 
cows' milk may be ass gned to this fact. 

Numerous estimations have been made of the caseinogen in 
both cows' and human milk, and the figures are given in text- 

1 Cp. W. A. Osborne. 



THE ORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 35 

books dealing with physiological chemistry. The estimations 
show a considerable degree of variation, but 3 per cent, appears 
to be an average round figure for the caseinogen of cows' milk, 
while for human milk i per cent, may be taken as a fair average. 
In both cases, however, considerable variations both above and 
below these figures are found. 

The published estimations of lact-albumin are less numerous 
than those of caseinogen. The amounts of albumin in human and 
cows' milk do not differ very widely, although it is usually greater 
in human than in cows' milk. Broadly, in human milk there appears 
to be about 0-5 per cent, albumin, the tendency being for the figure 
to be higher. In cows' milk 0-5 per cent, is given by some ob- 
servers as the figure for albumin, but, as a whole, it tends to be 
rather lower. 

Lehmann stated that in human milk 29-4 per cent, of the total 
protein was albumin, or 0-5 per cent, in the milk, while 70-6 per cent, 
of the total protein was caseinogen, which equals 1-2 per cent, in 
the milk. In cows' milk 9 per cent, of the protein was albumin, or 
0-3 per cent, in the milk, while 91 per cent, of the total protein was 
present in the form of caseinogen, or 3 per cent, in the original milk. 

The relative proportions of caseinogen and albumin are given 
by Schlossmann, who, estimating the total nitrogen content of 
human milk and its distribution on the twenty-fifth day after 
parturition, assigned 35 per cent, of the nitrogen to the albumin 
and 41 per cent, to the caseinogen. 

The same author, in another paper dealing with cows' milk, gives 
the percentage amount of the three proteins as follows : 

Caseinogen Lac to -globulin Lact-albumin 

3-185 per cent. 0-154 per cent. 0-374 P 61 " cen t- 

He found great resemblance between the albumin and the globulin, 
and considers that for nutritional purposes the latter may be 
neglected. 

Sidler assigns 43 per cent, of the total nitrogen in human milk 
to caseinogen and 42 per cent, to the whey-proteins, the remainder 
being non-protein nitrogen. 

The relatively high nitrogen content of milk during the colostral 
period has already been considered, and occurs both in human 
and cows' colostrum. There seems little doubt that colostrum 
contains a higher percentage of caseinogen and whey-proteins than 
later milk, but the evidence upon the amounts of these present 
at this period is not conclusive, wide variations being obtained 
by different authors. 1 

The work of Bauer (i, 3) and of Bauereisen on biological 
lines renders it likely that there is also a relatively higher pro- 
portion of whey-proteins in colostrum than in later milk.

36 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

The large amount of caseinogen present in cows' milk as com- 
pared with human milk, has, until the last few years, formed a 
prominent feature of the voluminous literature upon infant-feeding. 
It is probable that this has been the determining factor in the 
question of the dilution of cows' milk for infants, since average 
cows' milk contains less sugar and fat than human milk. 

Any general discussion upon the digestibility of cows' caseinogen 
for infants would be beyond the scope of the present work, but a 
few points may be considered. 

The numerous papers published both in America and Germany 
in recent years show no reason to suppose that the infant cannot 
digest cows' caseinogen. The so-called 'casein' curd of infants' 
stools has been shown not to be due to casein, but to the salts of 
fatty acids. 

Finkelstein reviewed the factors which at various times have 
been regarded as the detrimental element in artificial feeding. He 
says : ' Improved clinical observations, the metabolism experiments, 
and the comparative researches upon the fat of cows' and human 
caseinogen in the infant's intestine have concordantly demon- 
strated that the disturbance must have its origin in other circum- 
stances than in the harmful casein residue ' (schddliche Kaseinrest). 

In this country little research work has been carried out upon 
this matter. Cameron, however, reviewing the whole question, 
says, ' The disturbances of protein digestion are, generally speaking, 
secondary to fermentative dyspepsia. Although all that we know 
of the chemistry of infantile digestion and much accurate clinical 
observation point to this conclusion, it is often authoritatively 
taught that the protein of cows' milk is the most frequent source 
of trouble, and that which most commonly causes vomiting and 
colic,' and ' Evidence that diarrhoea and colic are caused by abnor- 
mal protein digestion is not forthcoming. In the stools of an infant 
fed upon cows' milk there are always present, in more or less 
abundance, white curd-like masses of soaps, formed by the com- 
bination of the fatty acids derived from the food with calcium 
and magnesium. These whitish curd-like masses of soap have 
much the appearance of undigested casein curds of milk, and their 
presence accounts for the frequent description of the stools by 
mothers and nurses as " undigested." ' Bauer (6) finds that true 
casein curds do sometimes occur in infants' stools, but he says that 
they occur only when the children are fed on raw cow's milk, dis- 
appearing when the milk given has been heated. This is also 
stated by Brennemann. 

From the hygienic standpoint it would not appear necessary 
to deal any further with the differences in the protein content of 
human and cows' milk. In colostrum the whole question assumes 
an important biological aspect, which will be considered below. 

The Chemical Composition of Caseinogen and Lact-albumin. 
Several investigations into the chemical composition both of 



THE ORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 



37 



caseinogen and of lact-albumin have been made, especially into 
that of the former body. In view, however, of the minimal 
nutritional importance of these minor differences, a detailed account 
will not be given. 

The main differences between the two bodies lie in the content 
of sulphur and phosphorus. Caseinogen contains a considerable 
amount of phosphorus, which is perhaps somewhat higher in cows' 
than in human caseinogen. On the other hand, human caseinogen 
appears to contain more sulphur than cows' caseinogen. Lact- 
albumin of both species contains a higher proportion of sulphur 
than the caseinogen of the corresponding species. 

The figures given by different observers, although showing 
slight divergences in the amounts of the elements found, are yet 
sufficiently concordant for it to be unnecessary to give many 
quotations. The figures below may be taken as giving the values 
sufficiently accurately :

The results obtained by Langstein and Edelstein should also be 
compared. 

The amount of calcium present in combination with caseinogen 
is variously given, and a general figure is difficult to obtain from 
the literature. Raudnitz appears to put the figure at something 
over i per cent, of calcium oxide (CaO) in caseinogen, but his 
remarks are not very precise. 

There is no doubt that a large part of the total calcium present 
in milk is in combination with caseinogen. 

The differentiation of cows' milk and human milk assumes a 
practical value in foreign hospitals where human milk is purchased 
at a high rate for the feeding of sickly infants. There is evidently 
a great temptation on the part of the nursing woman to add a 
little cows' milk to her own and sell at the higher rate. 

Bauer (4) and Bacchi have independently shown that the milks 
can be differentiated by a simple colour reaction. 

On the Interrelationship between the Proteins of the Milk 
and their Relationship to those of the Blood. The researches 



38 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

into the chemical composition of the milk proteins were made 
for the most part in the last thirty years of the nineteenth century. 
Several observers (cp. Eugling and Menozzi and Musso) believed, 
as a result of chemical analysis and methods of precipitation, 
that the albumin of milk and of blood were identical. A little 
later the idea seems to have been abandoned with some emphasis, 
probably owing to the rise of the physico-chemical school of physio- 
logists. The difficulties of establishing the identity of any two 
proteins by purely chemical means are manifestly immense, and 
the relationship of the proteins in milk and blood has been investi- 
gated in the present century by other methods. These methods 
have been evolved by workers on immunity, and have led to 
the discovery of most interesting facts concerning the proteins 
of milk. 

These facts are of importance in relation to the transference of 
immunity by suckling from mother to child, and will be considered 
in some detail. 

The first step was made by Bordet (1899), who showed that if 
an animal was injected with milk of another species, the serum 
of this animal, when withdrawn from the body, was found to have 
acquired the property of precipitating the milk of the species which 
had been used for injecting. Such a serum is known as a lacto- 
serum, and the reaction as the ' precipitin ' reaction. Practically, 
the phenomenon means that when a foreign protein is injected 
into the body, a reaction occurs on the part of the organism which 
enables it to throw this protein out of solution should occasion 
arise. This occasion is made to arise artificially by removing the 
serum and mixing it in a test-tube with some of the protein originally 
used. The substances which are capable of giving rise to this 
reaction on the part of the body are known as ' antigens.' The 
reaction is not absolutely specific for the one species, but may occur 
with the protein of a closely related species. For the present purpose 
the complication of allied species need not be considered, since 
there is no question that the proteins of the bovine and of the 
human species are ' foreign ' to one another. This specificity of 
human and cows' milk was shown by Rosenau and Anderson, 
using the method of anaphylaxis, and has been confirmed by 
numerous investigators. 

Hamburger (1901) showed that an anti-serum for ox blood 
would also precipitate milk, and that a lacto-serum for cows' milk 
would produce a precipitation with ox blood-serum. These observa- 
tions snowed a very close relationship between the proteins of blood 
and those of milk. Hamburger carried his observations yet further, 
and found that the proteins of milk could be differentiated ; a lacto- 
serum prepared by the injection of caseinogen will precipitate 
caseinogen, but not lact-albumin, and vice versa. All the results 
were not in complete accordance but they were sufficiently 
definite to show that, biologically, caseinogen and lact-albumin 



THE ORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 39 

are separate bodies. Bauer (i) believes that the partial dis- 
crepancies in Hamburger's work can be attributed to the method 
employed. 

Hamburger's work was confirmed by Schlossmann and Moro, 
who showed, by means of the precipitin reaction, that the proteins 
of cows' milk must be regarded as ' foreign ' to those of the human 
species, and that the caseinogen and lact -albumin in the milk of each 
species are distinct bodies. They found, further, that lact-albumin 
was biologically identical with the albumin of the blood. Small 
amounts of lacto-globulin were obtained from cows' milk, but 
Schlossmann (i) considers that from the nutritional standpoint this 
body may be safely neglected. The amount is very small, and it 
resembles albumin so closely as not to require separate con- 
sideration for infant feeding. Schlossmann (i, 2) considers that 
as the albumins of blood and of milk are identical substances, 
the albumin in milk can readily be, and probably is, absorbed 
directly by the infant in the early days of life. 1 

A few years later (1908) Bauer (2) showed that much finer differ- 
entiation of proteins could be obtained by using the method of 
' complement deviation.' This method has been mainly used by 
him in his subsequent extensive investigations in this direction. 

The work of Bauer (5) and of his pupil Kollmeyer shows that 
caseinogen must be placed biologically in a class by itself. 

The differentiation between the caseinogen and the whey- 
protein of the same species was more marked than that between 
the caseinogen of the cow and of the goat. On the other hand, 
lact-albumin anti-sera, both of cows' milk and of human milk, reacted 
with the serum-protein of the corresponding species, and seemed 
to show the biological identity of the whey- and serum-proteins. 

Using this method, which is more sensitive than the precipitin 
method, Bauer (2) and (3) obtained no reaction between a lacto- 
serum obtained by the injection of cows' milk, and ox-serum. He 
attributes this to the large amount of casein present, which body 
does not react with blood-serum. 

Bauereisen, using the precipitin method, showed the biological 
identity between the whey-protein and the proteins of the blood, 
and placed caseinogen somewhat apart from these in its biological 
properties. He considers that the whey-proteins of colostrum can 
be absorbed directly by the infant and form part of the blood 
protein. 

Bauer and Engel (1911) undertook further comprehensive 
investigations into the relationship of the milk-proteins, using the 
method of complement deviation. 

The caseinogen was separated out first by the acetic acid method 
of Engel (i). This was filtered off and the filtrate subjected to half 
saturation with ammonium sulphate. This treatment precipitated 

1 Cp. Chap. VI. 



4 o 



MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



a further amount of protein (globulin), which the observers believe 
is a true lacto-globulin. The albumin remaining in the fluid 
was obtained either by the addition of acetic acid or by complete 
saturation with ammonium sulphate. The authors found that, 
contrary to cows' milk, in human milk the yield of globulin was 
much greater than that of albumin ; in fact the amount of this last 
was so small that it was impossible to obtain a suitable solution for 
experimentation. 

The results of these authors leave no doubt that these three 
proteins in cows' milk are biologically distinct bodies, of which 
globulin, although present in smaller amounts, appears to be the 
stronger antigen, producing a stronger anti-serum. At the same 
time there is a clear relationship between the three proteins ; 
albumin and globulin are more nearly connected to one another than 
to caseinogen, and caseinogen resembles globulin more than it does 
albumin. This applies to both varieties of milk, with the reserva- 
tion that human albumin was not used. 

The following tables show : 

1. The relation of the three proteins, and 

2. The potency of the globulin in producing anti-sera, although 
the actual amount of globulin in the whey of cows' milk is less than 
the albumin.

The high power of globulin to form anti-sera is of considerable 
interest in view of the fact that the anti-toxins in the serum are 
known to be attached to the globulin fraction. Bauer and Engel 
showed further that the albumin and globulin obtained from 
milk and from serum are respectively biologically identical. 

Caseinogen is found in no other tissue-fluid, and stands 
apparently in a class by itself. 

The differentiation of the proteins of milk have been investigated 
by means of anaphylactic methods by Besredka and Heuner. 
Besredka found that with whole milk the toxic constituent was 
the caseinogen, and that sensitivity was not always produced 
by injecting whey. Heuner, working under Bauer, confirmed the 
differentiation of the three proteins, and also the relationships 
already mentioned. 

The Proteins of Colostrum. Fully as much work has been 
carried out upon the biological relation of the proteins of colos- 
trum, as upon those of later milk. 

Kollmeyer, Bauereisen, and Bauer and Engel, using the methods 
above described, have all reached the same fundamental con- 
clusion, namely, that the proteins of colostrum are biologically 
identical with those of later milk, and the whey-proteins of colostrum, 
as of later milk, are biologically indistinguishable from those of 
the serum. 

Bauereisen believed that the anti-serum obtained by the injection 



42 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

of colostrum was essentially a whey-protein anti-serum, owing 
to the predominance in the colostrum of these proteins. 

Kollmeyer and Bauer and Engel all agree as to the marked 
relative increase in the albumin-globulin bodies in colostrum 
as compared with later milk. 

Langer (1907) obtained a more powerful anti-serum by injecting 
colostrum than by using later milk. He does not appear to have 
distinguished between the different antigens in colostrum, but his 
observations can be explained by the work of the above authors. 
Konig's figures for the protein content of colostrum, given on p. 16, 
are of much interest in connection with the investigations just 
quoted. 

The value of colostrum from the nutritive standpoint has 
already been considered, and its importance in the question of 
immunity will be considered in Chap. VI. 

Some experiments have also been carried out in order to ascer- 
tain the effect (if any) of heat upon the power of the milk protein 
to produce anti-sera and anaphylaxis. These are dealt with in 
Chap. XIV. 

Wroblewski described another protein in cows' milk which he 
termed 'opalisin.' The presence of this body has, however, not 
been confirmed, and is denied by Eufinger. 

Meigs and Marsh described a further nitrogenous body in 
milk, but this also has not been confirmed. 

Some non-protein nitrogen undoubtedly occurs in milk, and 
its nature has been studied by several observers. Rietschel believes 
that urea accounts for the bulk of the non-protein nitrogen. 

An isolated observation and of interest has been made by Engel 
and Murschhauser (1,2). These observers found that urea appeared 
in the milk of an eclamptic woman. They subsequently succeeded 
in obtaining evidence of a rise of non-protein nitrogen in the milk 
of a healthy woman, who was fed on considerable amounts of urea. 
They suggest that the mammary gland may have a slight excretory 
function when waste material is present in excess in the blood. 

Fat. It has been shown in the preceding pages that no precise 
figure can be given for the fat content of milk. Even when a 
sample of the whole milk obtained at one time is taken, the figure 
holds only for that particular occasion. 

The work both of Hunnaeus and of Aurnhammer on human 
milk shows that considerable individual differences in the average 
amount of fat given in twenty-four hours may occur. Hunnaeus 
says the figure varies from 4 per cent, to 5 per cent, for the twenty- 
four hours, and Aurnhammer gives 4/5 per cent, to 5-5 per cent., 
but these are averages only, the actual figures showing a greater 
range. 

Aurnhammer finds that the total amount of fat given in the 
twenty-four hours by each individual is fairly constant, and that 
it does not increase with an increase in the amount of milk given. 



THE ORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 43 

Engel (1910) believes that an inverse ratio exists between the 
amount of milk and the amount of fat. He made estimations 
of the fat in the milk of a number of wet-nurses whose total out- 
put of milk was known. Some of the data given bear out Engel's 
contention, but any very general deduction upon the relationship 
of the amount of milk to the fat content is hardly justifiable from 
his figures. 

Helbich (1911), who carried out careful investigations upon 
the fat content in relation to the total amount of milk given at 
each feed, was unable to trace any relationship between the two. 
The diagram on p. 26 shows the results of one set of observations 
made by him, and the others are on the same lines. The fat content 
was usually lowest in the morning, rising considerably at one of 
the next feeds. In the diagram the 10 A.M. feed gave the highest 
percentage of fat, but this was not found in all the experiments. 

This is in general harmony with the observation of Eckles 
and Shaw on the variation in fat content of cows' milk due to 
different intervals of milking. They state that the milk about 
midday usually had the highest fat content. 1 

The average fat content of human milk is higher than that 
of cows' milk, although in the case of the cow variations due to 
breed, &c., may raise the level to that of human milk. Great 
individual variations also occur in both cases, as well as differences 
from other causes dealt with on pp. 22-26. 

A great deal of work has been done on the composition of the 
fat of both human and cows' milk, but there is no evidence to show 
that such differences in composition as may occur have any bearing 
upon the health of either infants or adults, and the subject will 
not be considered here. 

Reference may be made to the work of Arnold on human fat, 
where references to the literature upon this point, both for human 
and cows' milk, are also given. Eckles and Shaw give elaborate 
data upon the fat of cows' milk, with literature. 

Attempts have been made to produce an increased fat content 
in the milk by feeding on fat. Engel and Plaut found that 
increasing the fat in the food, even considerably, did not enable 
any appreciable increase in the fat content to be detected in the milk 
of a normally-nourished woman. If the intake of fat is below the 
amount required for the usual metabolism, the amount of fat in the 
milk is reduced.* These results are in agreement with those obtained 
in numerous investigations upon other constituents of milk. Similar 
work relating to the sugar content is given on the next page, and 
that relating to the inorganic constituents in the next chapter. 

The experiments conducted by Woll on the amount of butter- 
fat produced by cows in relation to their food are of great interest. 
Cows fed on a food which is below the minimal physiological require- 

1 Cp. p. 25. * Cp. p. 21. 



44 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

ments give a low amount of milk, the quantity rising again when 
the physiological requirements are fulfilled. Above this, however, 
although high feeding may produce an increase both in the amount 
of milk and in the butter- fat, this rise is in no way proportional 
to the increased amount of food. This has been considered in 
greater detail on pp. 20, 21. 

The presence of lecithin in milk has been investigated by several 
authors, with positive results. Stocklasa says that i litre of cows' 
milk contains from 0-90 to i'i3 gramme of lecithin, and the same 
amount of human milk contains from 170 to r86 gramme. 1 

There is no evidence as to the nutritional value of lecithin in milk. 

Sugar. The figures already quoted for the sugar content of 
cows' milk and human milk hardly require amplifying. 

In spite of the use of different methods of estimation of the 
sugar, fairly concordant results have been obtained. 

There seems no doubt that the sugar content of cows' milk 
is much below that of human milk. Lust, using the colorimetric 
method, has confirmed the figures for human milk ; and Antenrieth 
and Funk, using the same method, found the average amount 
to be 7'i per cent. 

The sugar content appears to be hardly affected by the period 
of lactation or by the composition of the dietary, so long as the 
dietary is sufficient for the needs of the organism. 

The experiments of Cathcart and Paton, already quoted, show 
that when the body is artificially depleted of glucose, the milk supply 
falls, and also the sugar content. 

Lust endeavoured to raise the lactose content of the milk by 
feeding nursing women with large amounts of dextrose and other 
sugars. In a few cases a very slight rise was noted, which might 
perhaps be attributed to the additional amount taken. No distinct 
alteration in the content of lactose was, however, obtained. 

This absence of effect due to increasing the amount in the 
food is in harmony with the work on other constituents considered 
later under the several headings. 

It appears from the work of Porcher, Cathcart and Paton, and 
others, that the sugar in the milk is synthesised in the gland itself 
from the carbohydrate present in the blood. This subject is, 
however, beyond the scope of the present work.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER IV 

ON THE INORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 

THE inorganic constituents of milk have formed the subject of 
considerable investigation. As a whole, it appears that the amount 
of the various salts which are present in cows' milk is greater than 
the amount of the corresponding substance in human milk. The 
chief exception has been shown to be iron. Recent investigations 
conducted upon the amount of this mineral present in the milk 
of women and of cows, leave little room for doubt that the iron 
content of human milk is from two to three times as great as that 
of cows' milk. 

The calcium content of milk has attracted much attention 
because it was supposed that a deficiency of calcium in the 
milk might be the cause of rickets. Although this possibility 
cannot be absolutely set aside, the numerous investigations 
which have been carried out show that there is no definite 
relationship between the occurrence of rickets and the amount 
of calcium which is found in the mother's milk in the case of 
breast-fed children. 

Numerous experiments have been carried out with a view to 
determining whether it was possible to increase the content of any 
particular salt in milk by the addition of this material to the food- 
stuff. The results obtained cannot be regarded as showing this 
possibility to any appreciable extent, although one or two observers 
claim to have produced a small increase in the amount present. 
The withdrawal, however, of any particular inorganic constituent 
found in the milk from the dietary produces an undoubted effect. 
The content of this substance in the milk is not reduced, at any rate 
appreciably, the organism depleting itself to maintain the normal 
percentage of this substance in the mammary secretion. As soon, 
however, as such depletion would injure the organism the supply of 
milk is reduced and the output of the constituents correspondingly 
decreased, thus preventing depletion of the maternal organism. 
On restoring to the dietary the required amount of the inorganic 
constituent, the amount of milk produced returns to its former 
level.

THE INORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 49 

CHAPTER IV 

ON THE INORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 

Total Ash. A large number of figures dealing with the total 
ash have already been given in the preceding sections. 

The ash content of cows' milk is in all cases considerably higher 
than that of human milk, so that the infant which is artificially 
fed on undiluted cows' milk does not suffer from lack of total 
ash. Variations appear in the amount found by various authors, 
especially among the earlier workers, bnt in no case does the varia- 
tion obliterate the marked difference between the total amounts 
of ash in the two classes of milk. 

Although there can be no doubt that all the inorganic materials 
present are needed for the life of the organism, certain of the con- 
stituents have received much closer investigation than others. 
The sodium, potassium, magnesium, &c., have been estimated 
both for cows' and for human milk, by Bunge, Camerer and Soldner, 
and others, and many of the figures have already been given. 1 

More detailed investigations have been carried out on the 
calcium, iron, and phosphorus content of both human and 
cows' milk, and in view of the importance of these constituents, 
it will be necessary to consider them in detail under separate 
headings. 

Iron. The iron content of milk is a subject of much im- 
portance and of considerable interest. 

The investigations made by the earlier workers give results 
which are so different from one another as to leave the reader of 
their papers in some degree of despair. 

The chief source of discrepancy lies in the difficulty of securing 
an accurate estimation of the minute quantities of iron that are 
present. Until a few years ago the methods used necessitated 
a preliminary desiccation and ashing of large quantities of fluid, 
and any error was accentuated owing to the very small amounts 
found. 

The colorimetric method of recent years has produced much 
more satisfactory results. Soxhlet states that it is correct to 
within 10 per cent., which, although a high percentage of error, 
is comparatively immaterial on the minute quantities concerned. 

The fact of primary importance to be decided is whether cows' 
milk contains as much iron as human milk, and if not, how great 
the deficit, and whether this can be repaired. 

A very interesting account of the history of the work upon 

1 See p. 1 8. 



MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



the iron content of human milk and of cows' milk, together with 
original investigations upon the subject, has been given by Soxhlet 
(1912). He deals with the theory of Bunge (2, 3, 4), who believed 
and the belief was supported by his pupils that the infant came 
into the world with a store of iron in the liver upon which it drew for 
its development. The iron in the food was apparently not con- 
sidered of much account. Bunge (i, 2) stated that human milk con- 
tained 4 mg. per litre, or 0^0004 per cent, of ferrous oxide (Fe a O 8 ). 
Soxhlet shows that this amount is more than enough to provide 
the iron required for the child as based upon the estimated require- 
ments made by Camerer. There is, therefore, no need to call 
upon the iron which is deposited in the liver from the broken-up 
red corpuscles. 

The simplest method of demonstrating the wide variations in 
iron content obtained by various authors will be to tabulate the 
results in chronological order, subsequently dealing individually with 
the more important papers.

The later results show that human milk contains about r6 
to 17 mgm. of ferrous oxide (Fe a O 3 ) per litre, or from three to 
four times as much as cows' milk, which contains from 0-3 to 0*7 
mgm. of ferrous oxide (Fe a 3 ) per litre. 

Some variations occur in the iron content in relation to the 
period of lactation. 



THE INORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 51 

Human Milk Camerer and Soldner 1 obtained the following 
figures : 

Early milk . . . 2-2 mgm. per litre 

Middle period . . . 2-0 
Late period . . . . I'O 

Soxhlet obtained a number of samples at different periods of 
lactation, and gives the following results : 

4th to 7th day (7 samples) . . . 1-2-2-2 mgm. 

together with 5 weeks (i sample) . average 1-7 mgm. 

Period unknown (2 samples) . 1-3-1-6 

Later period (7th month) (i sample) . 1-5 

Although some samples in the early days have a lower iron 
content than others, there seems to be a tendency for the content 
to fall towards the end of lactation. 

Cows' Milk. Trunz found some tendency for the iron con- 
tent to rise towards the end of lactation in one cow investigated, 
but not in the other. The figures obtained varied greatly on 
different days in the milk of the same cow. Thus in one cow the 
content varied from 0-019 to 0-045 gramme per kilo, the greater 
number of estimation being about 0-03 gramme per kilo. 

In the other cow the amount found varied from 0-009 t 0-023 
gramme per kilo, the majority of the estimations being just below 
0-02 gramme per kilo. 

Nottbohm and Dorr (1913) found a tendency for the iron 
content to rise towards the end of lactation. There is considerable 
variation in the amounts of iron given by different cows. The 
occurrence of mastitis appears to lead to an increase in the iron 
content and to simulate the condition of the end period of 
lactation. 

The varying tendencies exhibited by human and cows' milk 
in their iron content as regards the period of lactation has already 
been shown to occur in the case of nitrogen and applies also to the 
lime content. 

Langstein, and subsequently Edelstein and Csonka, state that 
the iron content of milk increases on keeping, and they believe 
that this is due to the passing into solution of small amounts of 
iron from the cans. No experimental evidence has, however, been 
brought forward to control this statement. 

Edelstein and Csonka used Lachs and Friedenthal's method 
of estimation. They took milk from individual cows, milked 
straight into the glass ; also mixed milk from the dairy at the

i. Direct into glass . . . 0-25-1-2 mg. per litre 

These very considerable variations do not appear to be fully 
explained. The authors make no mention of the period of lactation 
at which the various samples of milk were taken. 

Langstein (1911) suggests that this increase in the iron content 
of the milk by the iron derived from the vessels (if this really 
occurs) may not be of any use to the infants, as the iron may not 
be assimilable. 

The work of Krasnogorsky (1906) supports this supposition. 
Krasnogorsky investigated the iron metabolism of several infants 
fed naturally and on goats' milk. Several days were allowed to 
elapse after the commencement of the dietary before the estima- 
tions were begun, and when the same child was used for two 
sets of experiments, a considerable interval occurred between the 
experiments. 

The following table summarises the general outline of the 
work:

These figures demonstrate the immense superiority of the 
milk of the same species as regards the power of absorption and 
retention of the iron. 

A few experiments were also carried out on iron metabolism 



THE INORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF MILK 53 

in rather older children fed with egg-yolk and spinach. About 
59 per cent, to 70 per cent, of the iron was absorbed, and 55 per 
cent, to 70 per cent, retained. Ferratin was also tried, and it was 
found that about 23 per cent, was retained. 

Langstein investigated the iron metabolism of two breast-fed 
infants in the early weeks of life, one being twelve weeks and the 
other eight weeks old. 

He found that the first child retained about 0*255 m - P er day, 
and the second child 0-188 mg. per day. Hence there is no need 
for a store of iron in the body to provide for growth. 

Further work by Langstein and Edelstein also showed a positive 
iron balance in the early days of life. They obtained samples 
of the mother's milk, and accurate information as to the amount 
taken by the infant. A positive balance of 32 to 39 per cent, 
of the total intake in the early days of life, and of about 41 per cent, 
in the second week, was found. 

It seems evident that the milk of the species contains the 
amount of iron necessary for growth. 

Some experiments have been carried out in order to ascertain 
whether the iron content of milk can be raised by the addition of 
iron to the food of cows. 

It appears that at one period, evidently before the year 1902, 
a German firm advertised an article called ' Eisenzucker.' This 
substance, when added to the food in sufficient quantities, was said 
to increase greatly the iron content of the milk, and to render the 
milk highly valuable for cases of anaemia, &c. The precise iron 
content which could be obtained was stated to be 0-0842 per cent, 
of ferrous oxide. 

Giordani (1902) states that the injection of this substance into 
goats and rabbits caused an increase in the iron content of the 
milk, which was more than doubled in some cases. He found 
an accompanying slight reduction in the total milk output, but no 
change in the other constituents. 

Mai (1910) undertook feeding experiments with ' Eisenzucker.' 
The method used for the iron estimation is only claimed to be 
relatively accurate, but Mai obtained no evidence of a rise in iron 
content, unless a rise of o-oooi gm. per cent, on two occasions can 
be counted as an increase due to feeding. The substance itself was 
found to be the pharmacopceial preparation known as Ferrum 
Oxydatum Saccharatum. Mai states that the dairy on whose behalf 
the work was carried out informed the proprietor of the failure 
of the preparation, and powder was then offered to the dairyman 
with the suggestion that it should be added directly to the milk. 

Soxhlet also carried out feeding experiments on cows, using 
large quantities of ' Eisenoel ' and of haemoglobin. A rise of 0*1 mg. 
per litre occurred, which might be attributed to the feeding, but he 
concludes that alterations in iron content of the milk cannot be 
obtained by feeding with iron compounds. 



54 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

The conclusions which may be drawn appear to be : 

1. That human milk contains about three to four times as 
much iron as cows' milk. 

2. That there is sufficient iron in human milk for the needs of 
the infant. 

3. That the iron content of cows' milk cannot be increased by 
feeding with iron compounds. 

Calcium. Much work has been done upon the calcium 
content both of human and cows' milk, but the standpoint from 
which the investigations have been undertaken are somewhat 
different. In dealing with human milk, attention has been directed 
towards ascertaining the amount of lime present, and endeavouring 
to compare this amount with the calcium requirement of the 
young child. It seemed possible that a study of the calcium 
content of human milk might throw light upon the occurrence of 
rickets in breast-fed children. 

In cows' milk the investigations on the general calcium content 
have not been extensive ; efforts appear to have been directed 
mainly towards the percentage distribution of calcium that 
is, the amount present in organic and inorganic combination 
respectively. 

The distribution of the calcium content of milk that is, its 
combination with either organic or inorganic substances is not a 
problem which affects the present work. The normal infant or 
young animal can probably avail itself of the calcium present in 
the milk, whatever the form of the calcium. 

The work upon the calcium content of human milk carried out 
by the earlier authors has been carefully summarised by Bahrdt 
and Edelstein (2) in 1910, and it will only be necessary to refer 
anyone interested in the full details to the paper by these 
authors. 

The work of Hunnaeus (1909) may be mentioned before con- 
sidering that of Bahrdt and Edelstein. 

Hunnaeus studied the calcium content of human milk in relation 
to the stage of lactation, and other points. He found the calcium 
content for the same woman varied very little. 

1. In five samples of milk taken in the morning and evening, 
the amount varied between 0*046 per cent, and 0-0351 per cent. 

2. In six samples of milk taken as first milk and as end milk, 
the figures lay between 0-046 to 0-038 per cent., the content for 
the first milk being rather higher than that for the end milk. 

3. Samples taken from twelve women in the first month of 
lactation showed rather more variation, the figures varying from 
0-0518 to 0-0332 per cent. 

4. No variation occurred in the total calcium output in the milk 
of the same woman on different consecutive days, although in the 
later months of lactation there is a tendency for the total amount 
to decrease. This is shown in the following table :

5. Feeding experiments, where the mother was fed with calcium 
lactate and calcium phosphate to the amount of i gm. per diem, 
showed no increase in the calcium in the milk. Further, the removal 
of milk from the dietary of the mother, thus decreasing appreciably 
the amount of calcium taken, did not effect any reduction in the 
calcium content of the milk. 

These observations suggest that the variation in the calcium 
content of the milk of individual women is as great as variations 
from other causes. 

Bahrdt and Edelstein (1910) prepared a comprehensive table 
of the values obtained by previous observers in a large number 
of samples of human milk. It is unnecessary to quote the tables 
fully here ; it may be stated generally that great divergences in the 
calcium content evidently occur between the milk of individual 
women. 

Among the mothers of healthy children the variations extend 
from between O'o8 per cent, and 0-028 per cent., or between 300 
and 400 per cent, difference. The average amount was found by 
them to be 0-042 per cent., a figure which is about one-third higher 
than the usual average given. With these great individual 
differences the figure for the average amount is of little practical 
value. Further, a table was prepared showing the lime content 
of the milk of a number of mothers having rickety children. In 
this series the figures varied between 0-04646 per cent, and 0-019 
per cent. As many of the mothers in the second series were in the 
eleventh to thirteenth month of lactation, the low figures may be 
to some extent due to the late stage of lactation. The addition 



56 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

of calcium to the food of the nursing mother was found to be entirely 
without effect upon the lime content of the milk. 

The authors conclude that there is no general connection between 
the appearance of rickets in children and the calcium content of 
the mother's milk. 

Dibbelt (i) claims to have obtained a rise in the calcium content 
of milk by feeding with various forms of calcium compounds He 
investigated the milk of three women and obtained the following 
figures : 

Per cent. 

CaO 
Before feeding with calcium .... 0-0417

After feeding as in 2. 



0-0424 
0-0573 
0-0852 
0-0468 
0-0607 



These observations have not been confirmed by later investigators. 
Schabad examined the lime content of samples of milk taken 
both at the beginning and at the end of emptying the gland. The 
figures confirm the observations of Hunnaeus, since the individual 
differences between the milk of different women are shown to be 
greater than between the first and end milk : the content of the first 
milk is, however, rather higher than that of the end milk. 

Schabad gives the average calcium content as 0-042 per cent, 
for the mothers of healthy children (forty-nine cases), and 0-039 
per cent, for the mothers of rickety children (twenty-two cases). 
Schabad found that the organic constituents appear to be higher 
in the milk of mothers having rickety children, and he compared 
the lime content with the total caloric value. As a result of the 
raised amount of organic constituents, the actual proportion of 
lime to the caloric value of the milk is lowered, although the actual 
amount of calcium may not be very low. Addition of lime to the 
mother's food has no effect on the calcium content of her milk. 

The figures obtained by Schloss showed an average of 0-038 
per cent, in a number of samples taken both as mixed milk 
from fifteen to sixteen wet-nurses and in the milk of a number 
of individual women. Bamberg gives an average of 0-0439 per 
cent, from twenty-five samples. 

The question of appreciably influencing the lime content of 
human milk has received further attention from Zuckmayer. This 
worker fed twenty-six women with large amounts of calcium in 
the form of tricalcol or tricalcium phosphoretted casein, which was 
added to their food. Of the twenty-six women, twelve received 
the calcium for ten days after confinement only, and fourteen re- 
ceived it for from two months to sixteen days before confinement 
as well as afterwards.

The calcium content of human milk evidently varies within 
very wide limits, although usually at about 0*04 mg. per 100 c.c. of 
milk. The content of the milk of each individual is approximately 
constant, although there is a tendency to fall in the later months 
of lactation. 

Dibbelt (2), taking figures obtained by Thomas for the total ash 
of infants, concluded that the child frequently had to grow on a deficit 
of calcium in the early months. He regards this as a physiological 
arrangement to secure the transference of lime salts from the 
interior parts of long bone to the outer parts, a transference which 
has long been known to occur and which appears to be necessary 
for growth. He believes that '04 to '05 per cent, of calcium is 
sufficient for the infant, so that the needs of the child would there- 
fore appear to be met in the majority of cases. The amount taken 
in will also clearly be dependent upon the amount of milk taken, 
which has been shown to vary very considerably with different 
children. 1 

Several authors have endeavoured to trace a connection between 
the output of calcium and other constituents of the milk, chiefly 
in relation to fat. 

Hoobler studied the metabolism of a child of nine months on 
low, medium, and high fat diets, i.e. 2-1 per cent., 4 per cent., and 
5-4 per cent, of fat respectively. In low fat feeding calcium was 
withdrawn from the body, more calcium being found in the faeces 
than was present in the food. In high fat feeding 54- 57 per cent, 
of the calcium was retained. The greatest nitrogen and phosphorus 
intake occurred with a medium fat diet. 

Some relationship appears to exist between the calcium, nitrogen, 
and phosphorus. Schloss and Frank, studying the metabolism of 
children in the early stages of rickets, found that there was a high 
but rather unsteady nitrogen retention, but a bad retention of 
calcium and phosphorus. The addition of fat to the food, in the 
form of cod liver oil, led to an increased nitrogen output, but steadied 
the nitrogen balance. The addition of calcium phosphate raised 
the calcium balance and increased the retention of phosphorus. 

Aschenheim finds that in infants taking a normal diet with 
sufficient fat, calcium is excreted in the faeces only, but when the 



1 See Chap. VIII. 



5 8 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

diet has less than the normal amount of fat, calcium appears 
also in the urine. 

These observations suggest that there is some degree of 
antagonism between a high nitrogen retention and a high retention 
of calcium : the latter is encouraged by a high fat diet, but not the 
former. Work on the treatment of rickets by cod liver oil seems 
to show that one of the main advantages of this drug is to bring 
about an improved calcium retention. 1 A discussion of this matter 
would be beyond the scope of this work. 

Comparatively little work has been carried out on the total 
calcium content of cows' milk. 

The relationship of calcium to caseinogen has already been 
considered in Chap. III. 

The amount of calcium in cows' milk is many times higher 
than that in human milk. 

Tranz (1904) investigated the composition of the ash of cows' 
milk. He used the milk of two cows throughout a period of ten 
and twelve months respectively. He made separate estimations 
of the calcium combined with caseinogen and of the calcium present 
in the form of salts. The total calcium content appears to be 
about O'i8 to 0*19 per cent., a slight fall to about 0-154 per cent, 
occurring after the colostral period. The amount appearing as 
salts, i.e. not bound to caseinogen, is given as 0-13 per cent, to 0*14 
per cent., with a drop to 0*12 per cent, in the early months. 
Raudnitz gives o - 2 per cent, as the figure for lime content of cows' 
milk. 

The calcium which is present in the form of salts is probably 
mainly combined with phosphorus and with citric acid. A 
considerable amount of work has been done upon these salts in 
milk, but is outside the scope of this work. 

Phosphorus. It may reasonably be assumed that, as with 
the other constituents of the milk, the milk of each species, with 
respect to phosphorus, is specially adapted for the young of that 
species. 

From the public health aspect, the phosphorus content of milk 
does not appear to be as important as the content of other con- 
stituents, since the phosphorus content of cows' milk is greatly in 
excess of that in human milk, so that the human infant fed on 
cows' milk receives a plentiful supply of phosphorus. 

The phosphorus is present in several forms in caseinogen, as 
salts, and also in lecithin. 

Siegfried states that in cows' milk 6 per cent, of the total phos- 
phorus is combined with caseinogen, and in human milk 41-5 per 
cent., this latter milk containing relatively little inorganic phos- 
phorus. The high lecithin content found in human milk by 
Stocklasa has already been mentioned.

Bunge (i) gives the percentage of phosphoric anhydride (P 8 O 6 ) 
in the ash of human milk as 21-3 of the whole, that for cows' milk 
being 24*75. As, however, the total ash of cows' milk is much larger 
than that of human milk, the total quantity of phosphorus is 
correspondingly greater. 

Trunz gave figures for the P 2 6 content of cows' milk in the 
two cows whose milk was studied by him. Both cows showed a 
slight fall of phosphorus in the milk after the colostral period, 
rising again towards the end of lactation. The figures given show 
an approximate distribution as follows :

Raudnitz gives the figure for the phosphorus in cows' milk as 
O'24 per cent, and for human milk 0*05 per cent. 

Schloss, 1 working with human milk, obtained the values of : 

0*040 per cent, as the average figure for eight women, 
and 0*044 per cent, 
and 0-038 per cent, respectively for the two mixed 

samples, 
or an average of 0*041 per cent. 

Zuckmayer obtained a slightly lower value for the average of 
a large number of samples, namely, 0*0348 per cent. 1 

Glikin gives values for the distribution of the phosphorus in 
milk, in especial relation to the lecithin content ; but this is beyond 
the scope of the present work. 

Fingerling (i) fed goats on phosphorus-containing substances 
lecithin, phytin, casein, nuclein, nucleic acid, and di-sodium 
phosphate. No increase was obtained in the phosphorus content, 
nor of the ash of the milk, nor was there any rise in the total 
amount of milk given. This agrees with the work of Zuckmayer 
on pp. 56-57. 

Fingerling concludes, however, that these substances may be 
used to make up the requisite amount of phosphorus in the food 
in the case of an animal giving a large quantity of milk and conr 
sequently in danger of losing too much phosphorus. The other ex- 
periments by this worker (2), quoted on p. 21, show that when the 
total phosphorus intake is decreased below the physiological limit 

1 For details compare p. 9. 



60 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

of health, the amount of milk falls the mechanism being one of 
protection to prevent undue depletion of the organism owing to 
output of this constituent in the milk. 

It has been stated that phosphates are excreted in the urine 
of infants suffering from digestive disturbances, and that the 
amount excreted varies with the degree of the disturbance. The 
literature is not very extensive, but it is beyond the scope of this 
work. 

Recent work by Kaminer and Mayerhofer, and by Knox and 
Tracy, suggests that the normal breast-fed infant does not excrete 
phosphates in the urine, but that phosphates tend to appear with 
alteration of food or with digestive disturbances. Knox and Tracy 
agree that bottle-fed children excrete more phosphorus in the 
urine than breast-fed children. The literature on the subject is 
discussed by these authors.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER V 

THE SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 

A. THE FERMENTS OR ENZYMES 

A GREAT deal has been written and spoken about the ferments 
or enzymes in milk, and many writers have attributed great 
importance to the presence of these substances. It will be of 
interest to consider briefly how the discussion upon this question 
has arisen. 

Before the beginning of the present century physicians do not 
appear to have taken much interest in the question, although a 
considerable amount of work had already been done by numerous 
chemists. In the year 1900, Professor Escherich, of Vienna, at 
that time one of the foremost physicians for children's diseases, 
sought to account for the difference in progress made by infants 
fed on boiled cows' milk as compared with breast-fed babies, by 
suggesting that milk contained certain ' properties ' which were 
destroyed by boiling and which might be of value for the infant. 
It may be remarked here, that boiled milk is almost universally used 
on the Continent, since raw milk, even though carefully collected, 
is not considered a safe food for infants. This idea, once started, 
opened up a very wide field of investigation and occupied the 
attention of a number of observers for many years. Recently, 
the literature on the medical side has decreased in amount, and 
the interest appears to have slackened considerably. The investiga- 
tions are, however, still continued by dairymen for purposes which 
are not directly connected with the feeding of infants, and which 
will be alluded to briefly in this chapter. 

The discovery in milk of a considerable number of ferments 
has led a number of people to describe milk as a ' living substance,' 
and to credit milk with powers which investigation has not sub- 
stantiated. Before dealing in detail with the ferments which are 
found in milk, a few preliminary considerations are necessary. 

It must be remembered that milk is a secretion produced by the 
mammary gland, and its production is on analogous lines with the 
secretion of saliva by the salivary glands. The knowledge which we 
possess of secretory processes in general shows that although each 

63 



64 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

gland manufactures certain chemical substances differing in composi- 
tion from those manufactured by other organs, the secretion also con- 
tains traces of waste products which have passed out from the blood- 
vessels in small amounts, so that the secretion also contains some 
substances which have been derived from the blood by filtration. 
Every living cell contains ferments, and every animal organism 
depends for its existence upon the action of ferments. Digestion, 
leading to the assimilation of digested food-stuffs, and the inter- 
change of nutritive material in fact, most of the processes connected 
with the metabolism or life of a cell are due directly or indirectly 
to the action of ferments. This being the case, it is unreasonable 
to suppose that ferments do not exist in every part of the body. 
There is considerable variation in concentration of the ferments, 
but the fluids of the body, practically without exception, contain 
ferments of one kind or another. 

As far as is at present known, each ferment performs one action, 
and one action only that is to say, it is adapted for working 
upon and effecting an alteration in one particular chemical substance 
only. A ferment which will attack a fatty substance has no effect 
whatever upon a substance belonging to the class of starches or 
sugars. Each ferment, therefore, is said to be ' specific ' in its 
activity. Evidently there must be a great number of ferments, 
each of which fulfils its own part in the life of the animal organism. 

Ferments are produced by animal cells and by bacteria. 
Actions identical in their effects with those due to certain ferments 
are also caused by certain metals, when these are in colloidal 
form. Thus spongy platinum will break up hydrogen peroxide, 
with the evolution of oxygen, in the same way that this substance 
is split by the ferment catalase, which is found in the blood and 
in the tissues. 

Ferments are present in every cell of the mammary gland. It is 
known that these cells break down and disintegrate in the course 
of milking and of milk production, since portions of cells can always 
be found, together with intact cells, in the sediment from any sample 
of milk. It is impossible to suppose, therefore, that ferments would 
not be found in the milk owing to the presence of these portions of 
disintegrated cells. Moreover, the blood and lymph, carrying the 
nutritive substances to the cells of the mammary gland, contain 
ferments and, as in the case of the other secretory glands, traces 
of substances find their way through from the blood and lymph 
into the secretion of the gland, in this case into the milk. 

There is abundant evidence to show that ferments of various 
kinds are present in milk, and that these ferments differ, both in 
quantity and also in quality, in the milk of different species. In 
addition to the ferments derived from the gland itself, ferments 
are frequently introduced after the milk has been collected. This 
is due to the presence of bacteria in the milk, the bacteria having 
been derived from the air or from the cow herself, or from other 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 65 

sources of contamination since milking. The bacteria which are 
present are capable of producing different varieties of ferments 
in considerable quantities. Evidently, if investigations are being 
made into the ferments which are present in milk as such, it is 
essential that the presence of ferments due to subsequent bacterial 
action should be eliminated. This consideration did not, however, 
receive due attention among the earlier observers, and in a large 
number of instances the milk used for investigation was collected 
with no special precautions, and the bacterial content, which was 
probably considerable, was not taken into account. In some 
cases the observers appear to have been conscious of a defect 
in their investigations, and endeavoured to kill the bacteria by 
introducing antiseptics before they proceeded with their investiga- 
tions upon the presence of ferments. This method, although it 
may have been successful in killing the bacteria, did not remove 
the ferments which had been manufactured by them before they 
were killed. 

A great many investigations have been carried out with a view 
to discovering a method of detecting whether milk had been boiled 
prior to being sold. In 1898, when the campaign against tuber- 
culosis in cattle was commenced in Denmark, regulations were 
issued for compulsory pasteurisation, in order to limit the spread 
of tubercular disease by means of milk. It was necessary to pro- 
vide a test which would ensure the fulfilment of the prescribed 
pasteurisation, and such a test was based upon the presence in 
milk of a ferment which gave a specific colour reaction. This 
ferment, now known as peroxidase, gives a peculiar grey-blue 
colour when treated with paraphenylene-diamine and hydrogen 
peroxide. If the milk has been boiled, this reaction is modified 
or destroyed. Storch, who first worked out this reaction, believed 
that it was reliable for differentiating between milk which had 
been heated to 80 C., and above, and milk which had not been 
heated to so high a temperature. This reaction, about which 
more will be said later, is very generally known as Storch's reaction 
or test. 

Efforts have also been made to utilise a colour reaction produced 
by a ferment for estimating the number of bacteria present. A 
considerable number of bacteria have the property of ' reducing ' 
methylene blue. By their action, they slightly alter the chemical 
composition of this substance, and the colour completely disappears, 
the milk to which this substance has been added becoming white. 

Efforts have been made to utilise the ferment action of milk 
for yet another purpose, namely, to discover the presence of milk 
from a diseased cow when the milk from such a cow has been added 
to a general milk supply. A different ferment, catalase, has been 
investigated in connection with this matter, and is one which acts 
upon hydrogen peroxide with the evolution of oxygen in the form 
of gas. This gas can be collected over the surface of the milk, and 



66 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

the amount given off by a known quantity of milk can be estimated. 
The reaction has not proved extremely reliable, since this ferment 
is also readily formed by a number of the bacteria which may 
have gained access to the milk after its collection, and also to 
the fact (which will be considered in detail later) that diseased 
conditions of the udder do not universally produce a rise in the 
content of this ferment in milk. The literature, therefore, is con- 
cerned with the ferments in milk in connection with several different 
matters. In this work the main consideration must be directed 
to the presence of ferments from the point of view of the nutrition 
of the infant or young animal, although it will be impossible to 
omit some consideration of the other aspects. 

On the Possible Value to Infants of the Ferments present in Milk.- - 
There are two ways in which ferments in milk might be useful to 
the infant. They might either assist in the digestion of the food 
material contained in the milk after it has been taken by the infant, 
or they might conceivably act as subsidiary agents in connection 
with the digestive processes, although not themselves directly 
concerned. In view of the specificity of ferments, the first point, 
namely, the digestion of the substances in milk itself, is evidently 
concerned only with such ferments as are capable of attacking and 
altering the various food materials present in the milk. These have 
been shown in the previous chapter to consist of nitrogenous 
substances, or proteins, of carbohydrate, or sugar, and of fatty 
substances. Inorganic constituents do not require consideration, 
from this point of view. We are, therefore, first concerned with 
the investigation of the presence of such ferments as can attack 
the organic substances, and afterwards with those having a possible 
subsidiary action. 

Proteolytic Ferments, i.e. those acting on Proteins. Various 
observers have carried out work upon this matter, but in several 
cases the milk was not free from bacteria at the time of investigation. 
Proteolytic ferments are produced by a considerable number of 
bacteria, hence when these latter are present it cannot be assumed 
that the milk itself contained these ferments. The earliest investi- 
gations were carried out in connection with the ripening of cheese 
by Babcock and Russell (1897). The work of these observers 
is chiefly interesting as being the earliest observations upon this 
point, but in view of the fact that the milk was not free from bacteria, 
they do not call for detailed consideration here. Further infor- 
mation is given in Chap. V. No subsequent observer found any 
marked proteolytic action in milk, although several observers 
obtained evidence of the breaking down of a small portion of the 
protein when the experiments were carried out over a prolonged 
period. For the present purpose such experiments are of com- 
paratively little interest, because milk, when taken by the infant, 
is digested within a few hours after it enters the body, so that 
experiments conducted over a period exceeding a few hours cannot 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 67 

be regarded as of any value. Investigations carried out by myself, 
in which experiments were conducted with bacterial-free milk over 
a period of twenty-four hours, gave no indications of proteolytic 
action in milk. 

Grimmer, who has carried out much work upon many aspects 
of milk, has more recently investigated the ferments present in 
the mammary gland itself. He examined the resting and active 
glands of a number of animals, and found that a small amount of 
proteolytic activity occurred when the gland, carefully prepared 
for experiment, was allowed to stand and to undergo auto-digestion. 
The action was more marked in the active gland, but in no case 
was the action strong enough to affect any foreign protein intro- 
duced that is, it was only able to act upon the protein of the 
gland itself. There seems some possibility of another ferment 
being present in the active gland which has the power of breaking 
down simpler substances (polypeptides) derived from proteins. 
Grimmer states that the presence of these ferments in the gland 
itself is doubtless due to the necessity for the production of milk 
protein from the proteins of the gland itself. 

As concerning the proteolytic action in milk itself, after reviewing 
the literature, he comes to the conclusion that the proteolytic 
action of milk, if present at all (upon which, he says, the evidence 
is not very conclusive), is so small that it cannot be regarded as 
being worthy of any serious consideration as an aid to digestion 
in the infant. 

Fat-splitting or Lipolytic Ferments. Experimentation upon 
the presence of a lipase in milk is not easy, and the number of 
investigations carried out have not been large. 

Experiments on Human Milk. It appears fairly certain 
that human milk does contain a ferment capable of splitting fatty 
substances. This action, however, is said to be insufficient to show 
any action upon fat contained in the milk itself, and is only 
demonstrable when fatty substances are added to the milk. As 
a whole, two substances have been used for this purpose, mono- 
and tri-butyrin, and some evidence has been obtained of the splitting 
of this substance by human milk. The most important investiga- 
tions have been those of Davidsohn, who has made some interesting 
observations. Davidsohn added a few drops of tributyrin to fresh 
human milk, and found that, after gently shaking for a few minutes, 
a peculiar smell, that of butyric acid, was produced. He showed 
that the action of this ferment was connected with the phenomenon 
of surface tension in the milk, the surface tension being reduced 
by the action of the ferment. This action is not observed in milk 
unless tributyrin be added to the milk. He found the ferment 
both in the whole milk and in the whey, and showed that its action 
was of a similar type to the fat-splitting ferment present in the 
blood. There seems no reason to doubt that this ferment is derived 
from the blood stream, and passes into the milk by a process of 

F 2 



68 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

filtration. It is present in much smaller amounts in the milk than 
in the blood. 

Experiments on Cows' Milk. One or two of the earlier observers 
have stated that cows' milk contained a fat-splitting ferment. 
This has not been confirmed by later observers. Davidsohn, 
when using cows' milk, was unable to obtain the above-mentioned 
reaction for human milk. 

Ferments acting on Sugar. Some observations have been 
carried out with a view to ascertaining whether milk contained 
a ferment capable of acting on the sugar in milk, i.e. lactose. The 
investigations are accompanied by considerable experimental 
difficulties in determining a change of a small order in the quantity 
of sugar present. The older observers, who worked with milk 
containing bacteria, believed that they obtained evidence of some 
action upon the sugar. So many bacteria are capable of fermenting 
milk-sugar that unless the milk is absolutely germ-free, the dis- 
appearance of a small quantity of this sugar cannot be regarded 
as necessarily due to an action in the milk as such. Lactose, 
when acted upon by the ferment lactase, is split up into two mole- 
cules of different sugars, namely, one molecule of galactose and 
one of glucose. This action is known to take place very readily 
in the alimentary canal of the infant. It has been shown by Aders 
Plimmer that lactase is present in the alimentary canal of young 
animals at birth, and in some species of animals even before birth, 
in considerable amounts, and will rapidly convert the lactose into 
the simpler sugars, which are then absorbed for the use of the 
organism. 

Lactase, if present at all in milk, is present only in infinitesimal 
quantities, and it is more likely that it is entirely absent, and that 
such disappearance of lactose as has been observed, has been due 
to bacterial action. Since the sugar becomes converted to the 
simpler sugars within a very short period of its being taken by the 
infant, no physiological value can be attributed to the possibility of 
minute traces of lactase in the milk. 

Briefly, it may be said that cows' milk does not contain ferments 
capable of aiding the digestion of the substances in milk itself, to 
an appreciable extent. One of the ferments is present in larger 
amounts in human milk than in cows' milk, but even here the effect 
upon digestion in the infant must be regarded as negligible. The 
presence of these ferments is almost certainly to be accounted for 
by filtration from the blood, or as a result of the breaking down 
of the cells of the gland itself. 

On the Presence of Oxidising Ferments. Reference has already 
been made to a ferment whose presence has been used to detect 
previous heating of the milk. This ferment is known as peroxi- 
dase, because it acts on substances known as peroxides. The 
literature upon this ferment is extensive. 

The first observations upon the presence of this ferment appear 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 69 

to have been made in the year 1868 by Klebs, since when there 
has been a continuous succession of papers dealing with one aspect 
or another of its activity. For many years it was believed that 
there were two ferments present in milk, both acting as oxidising 
agents that is, they were both capable of increasing the amount 
of oxygen in certain substances, but had slightly different actions. 
This belief appears to have been due to the fact that different 
reactions were obtained according as the test solution had been 
allowed to stand for some time before using or not. 

The method of testing for this ferment which was first used, 
was to add guaiacum tincture to milk. In certain cases the milk 
at once turned blue. In others this blue reaction was only brought 
about after hydrogen peroxide had also been added. It seems 
clear as a result of later observations that the difference arose 
from the fact that when guaiacum tincture is allowed to stand, 
a substance develops in it which can take the part of hydrogen 
peroxide and produce the blue colour at once without the addition 
of this substance. Guaiacum tincture is not so much used at the 
present time, since Storch, whose investigations have already 
been alluded to, discovered that a more reliable reaction was 
obtained when the substance known as para-phenylene-diamine 
was used, instead of the guaiacum tincture. It has already been 
mentioned that this reaction results in the formation of a grey-blue 
coloration in the milk. A number of other substances are now 
used to replace or act as supplementary tests to the para-phenylene- 
diamine. Many of these substances strike extremely brilliant 
colours in the milk, and are believed by many to be equally reliable. 
In this country, however, the peroxidase test appears to be most 
usually carried out with para-phenylene-diamine, and this method 
will be regarded as the recognised one in the following remarks. 

On the Presence of Peroxidase in Cows' Milk. This ferment 
appears to be universally present in cows' milk. It is also widely 
distributed throughout the entire animal and vegetable kingdoms, 
being found in a very great number of vegetable tissues as well 
as in most animal tissues. It is present in blood in considerable 
quantities ; in fact, a common test for the presence of blood is 
the test above alluded to, with guaiacum tincture. The desirability 
of possessing a reliable test for milk which has been heated is so 
evident as to need no further consideration. It applies equally in 
countries where the regulations demand that market milk shall 
be pasteurised, and in those, such as this country, where milk is 
expected to be sold in a raw condition. 

Although this test does show roughly whether milk has been 
previously heated or not, it is not absolutely reliable. The dis- 
appearance of the colour reaction after the milk has been boiled 
is somewhat variable and depends upon the length of time of 
heating, the temperature to which the milk has been raised, and 
the rate at which the heating has been carried out. These con- 



7 o MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

siderations, influencing the effect of the reaction, have not been 
taken into due consideration. As a result, there is a great deal of 
discrepancy between the observations of the numerous investigators 
who have dealt with this subject. Some assert that heating to 
75 C., the temperature which was believed by Storch to be sufficient 
to prevent the reaction occurring, is inadequate. Others state 
that 70 C. is sufficient if the milk be kept at this temperature for 
half an hour, and so on. Where the length of time of heating 
and the temperature to which the milk has been raised are unknown, 
and the reaction not very marked, difficulty is likely to arise in 
determining whether the milk can be considered to have been 
heated or not. 

Further, where the dairyman desires that it should not be 
known that the milk has been heated, the addition of a small 
proportion of raw milk causes the reaction to return, and un- 
less full precautions are taken, and a considerable series of observa- 
tions carried out, the observer may be entirely deceived as to the 
presence of a large amount of heated milk. In spite of these draw- 
backs, however, no other method appears to be available for 
determining whether milk has been heated or not. 

Much controversy has arisen in regard to the chemical mechanism 
which produces this reaction in milk. For some years past a discus- 
sion has been proceeding between several German dairy chemists as 
to the true state of affairs in regard to this substance. It is stated 
on the one hand that the reaction is not due to a ferment at all, 
and that it depends for its production upon the reaction of the 
milk, which must be alkaline for the production of this reaction ; 
also that, even having due regard to the alkalinity, the presence 
of iron is instrumental in bringing it about. The opposite state- 
ment is that this reaction is a true ferment action inasmuch as, 
although it does depend upon the alkalinity of the milk, it is only 
in part dependent upon the reaction, and depends also upon the 
physical condition of the protein present in the milk. If the 
protein is in any way altered, the reaction is not produced, although 
the milk may be of the necessary alkalinity. 

A number of observers have dealt with the relationship of this 
reaction to the presence of iron. It seems probable that it is con- 
nected with the presence of iron in colloidal form, and possibly also 
of manganese. This presents no difficulty when considered in 
relation to milk, since it has already been shown that iron is 
constantly present in milk, and the investigations which have been 
made show that the amount of iron present in cows' milk, although 
small, is quite sufficient to produce this reaction. Infinitesimally 
small quantities of manganese have also been found in the ash of 
milk by several observers. The full mechanism of this reaction 
is even now not entirely understood, but for the present purpose 
no difficulty is presented. 

On the Presence of Peroxidase in Human Milk. Numerous 



SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES' OF MILK 71 

observers have investigated the peroxidase reaction in human 
milk with varying results. In some cases peroxidase has been 
stated to be present ; in others no trace of it has been detected. 
It seems reasonable to suppose that when present it is present only 
in small quantities, and that frequently it is entirely absent in human 
milk. Some observers (Spolverini, Marfan and Gillet, Friedjung 
and Hecht) believed that the ferment is more constantly present 
in colostrum than in the later milk, and that its presence is probably 
due to the leucocytes, which are more numerous in colostrum than 
later. But even in colostrum no reaction was obtained in a certain 
number of cases. Friedjung and Hecht examined 174 samples 
of milk, and found the reaction to be negative in 114 cases. Some 
observers have failed to detect any peroxidase in the samples of 
milk examined by them, and have consequently believed that it 
was absent in human milk. 

Efforts have been made to trace an effect upon the progress of 
the infant according as peroxidase was present in the milk of its 
mother or not. These have been entirely unsuccessful, no difference 
being detectable in the progress of the infants. 

Summary of the Position in regard to Peroxidase in Milk. It 
appears that peroxidase is constantly present in cows' milk, but 
that its presence is extremely inconstant in human milk. There 
is no reason to believe that it has any effect upon nutrition. The 
fact of its frequent absence in human milk would in any case tend 
to the belief that its effect was negligible. 

Reductases, or Reducing Ferments. The presence of these 
substances has caused as much discussion as that connected with 
the previous ferment, peroxidase. The early investigators dis- 
covered that the bright blue coloration, produced on the addition 
of methylene blue in small quantities to milk, frequently disappears 
if the milk is incubated, the milk becoming quite white. It was 
noticed that the time required for the colour to disappear varied 
considerably in different samples of milks. The disappearance of 
the colour is due to chemical changes which take place in the 
methylene blue. It is not necessary for the present purpose to 
enter into a long account of the reduction of methylene blue alone. 
It is now universally admitted that this reaction is brought about 
solely by the bacteria which have obtained access to the milk 
after milking. Efforts have been made to utilise this reaction 
to standardise the number of bacteria present and to enable an 
estimate to be arrived at of the ' goodness ' or otherwise, of the milk 
for purposes of sale. But this is not a satisfactory procedure, since 
only certain strains of bacteria will effect this reduction, and no 
indication is given of the number of bacteria present which do not 
decolorise methylene blue. This reaction is frequently known as 
the direct reductase reaction. 

In 1902 Schardinger published a paper in which he showed that 
milk, when quite fresh, did not reduce methylene blue alone, but 



72 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

would do so when a small amount of formalin was added to the 
methylene blue solution. This solution, which is now very generally 
known by the name of its discoverer, Schardinger, is also referred 
to as the F.M.B. solution (that is, formalin-methylene-blue solution), 
and the reaction as the F.M.B. reaction, and this term will be used 
here. It is also known as the indirect reductase reaction. 

The literature upon the Schardinger reaction is now nearly 
as extensive as that of the other ferments in milk. This reaction, 
which appears to be usually present in cows' milk, occurs only 
during the first few hours after milking. If the milk is quite 
fresh, the methylene blue will be reduced by the F.M.B. solution. 
After some twelve hours this reaction is no longer given, but is 
gradually replaced by the direct reduction of methylene blue 
owing to the presence of bacteria. Some observers have stated 
that the F.M.B. reaction is also bacterial, but this appears not 
to be the case, since it has been definitely found in milk obtained 
free from bacteria. This ferment cannot be regarded as having 
any influence upon nutrition. It acts only when formalin has 
been added to the milk, and therefore would not act at all in the 
stomach of an infant. Moreover, its action is entirely destroyed 
in an acid medium such as that of the infant's stomach. Further, 
by the time cows' milk has been brought to the infant, the reaction, 
even in the presence of formalin and an alkaline medium, will be 
no longer shown. The investigations which have been carried 
out have failed to detect this reaction in human milk, thus again 
accentuating the absence of value of this ferment from a nutritional 
standpoint. 

On the Presence of Catalase. The ferment which is known 
by this name has the power of splitting hydrogen peroxide with 
the evolution of oxygen. A vast amount of work has been carried 
out upon the presence and origin of this ferment in milk, and, as 
already mentioned, efforts have been made to obtain a standard 
for the amount of catalase present, so that excess of this substance 
could be taken as denoting a pathological condition of the milk. 

Catalase in Cows' Milk. As a result of much investigation, it 
appears that catalase is universally present in cows' milk, although 
the amount of this ferment which is present, varies within consider- 
able limits. Catalase is present in most tissues, and is found in 
large quantities in the blood. It is also formed by a great 
number of bacteria. These two last sources of catalase at once 
give possible origins of catalase in milk. It may be present either 
as a result of filtration from the blood, or may be the result of 
bacterial contamination of the milk after it has been collected. 
In market milk this latter source provides the greater part of 
the catalase content of the milk. 

In order to determine the catalase content of milk as it leaves 
the udder, it is necessary to investigate the milk immediately after 
it has been collected. The milk should be free from bacteria. 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 73 

Several methods have been used for the estimation of the gas 
(oxygen) evolved as a result of the action of this ferment upon 
hydrogen peroxide, when added to milk. Some of the methods 
are fairly reliable, others appear to be less so. It is necessary 
for the apparatus to be shaken constantly or at very frequent 
intervals, if an approximately accurate estimate of the total gas 
evolved is to be obtained. Some of the methods do not provide 
for this. 

The amount of oxygen collected from milk collected free from 
bacteria is very small, although somewhat variable. It has been 
shown by various authors l that the catalase rises with the cream, 
and that if separate estimations be made of the oxygen evolved 
from the first milk, middle milk, and strippings, the content gradually 
rises as the end of milking is reached. 

Rullmann, and Harden and Lane-Claypon, working on sterile 
milk, found that small quantities of oxygen were evolved even 
when there was no evidence of any bacteria present in the milk. 
Rullmann's results showed that in the first hour practically no 
gas at all was evolved, but that after eighteen to twenty-four hours 
the amount obtained from 20 c.c. of milk varied between 0-2 and 
3*6 c.c. Harden and Lane-Claypon obtained larger quantities in a 
few cases, but much variation in the amount evolved was shown. 

This brief summary of the large amount of work which has 
been carried out, which is described more fully in Chap. V, 
shows that catalase is present in milk which is uncontaminated by 
bacteria, in variable but always in small amounts. It is not known 
whether catalase plays any part at all in nutritional processes. It has 
been suggested by several authors that the almost universal presence 
of catalase in tissues has for its object the immediate splitting up 
of any peroxide which might be formed, which substances are 
believed to be detrimental to the life of the cells. It is difficult 
to attribute any importance to the small quantities of catalase 
present in fresh milk, especially when compared with the large 
amounts present in the blood. It is almost certain that the catalase 
present in the milk from a healthy gland, is derived from the blood 
by the process of filtration. Additional proof of this is afforded 
by the fact that in diseased conditions of the udder or in the later 
stages of lactation, when the milk assumes more of the characteristics 
of serum, the catalase content tends to be increased. 

On Catalase in Human Milk. Numerous investigations have 
been conducted as to the presence of catalase in human milk. 
There is a general concensus of opinion that catalase is present, 
but the amounts show great variations, both from day to day in 
the same woman, and between different women. As a whole, it is 
probably present in larger amounts when the gland is working 
feebly, owing to the poor health of the mother, and at the beginning 

1 Cp. Reiss, Jensen, and others. 



74 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

of lactation. No nutritional value has been attributed to it by any 
observer. 

Two other ferments have been the subject of considerable in- 
vestigations which do not belong either to the ferments acting upon 
substances present in milk, nor have they been used for commercial 
or public purposes. These ferments are amylase, which acts upon 
starch, converting it into dextrin, and salolase, which acts upon salol, 
converting it into phenol, and salicylic acid. It is difficult to 
imagine that either of these substances can play any part in the 
nutrition of the infant. 

Amylase. There is no starch in milk, but amylase is present 
in considerable quantities in the blood, and it is most probable 
that it is present in milk as a result of filtration. 

Another source of this ferment may be the mammary gland, since 
Grimmer obtained evidence of its presence in his experiments on 
gland tissue, even in those animals where little or no amylase 
was found in the milk. 

A considerable number of observers have investigated the 
presence in both cows' milk and human milk of a ferment capable 
of splitting starch into simpler bodies. 

Amylase in Human Milk. Human milk appears to possess 
the capacity of splitting starch, all observers being agreed upon this 
point. The amount of starch which can be converted within a 
period of a few hours is not large, although the action is quite 
definite. It has long been known that amylase is present in 
the blood, and it is probable that the presence of this ferment in 
milk is due to filtration through from the blood itself. 

Amylase in Cows 9 Milk. There is some difference of opinion 
among investigators in regard to the presence of amylase in cows' 
milk. A number of observers have entirely failed to find any 
evidence of this ferment in the milk of this animal. When found, 
it is present only in small quantities. Thus Giffhorn, in 1910, 
found that 100 gms. of milk will decompose from - oi to -25 gm. of 
starch. In experiments carried out by myself upon cows' milk, 
it appeared that 10 c.c. of cows' milk were capable of splitting from 
ooi to *002 gm. of starch in three hours in an incubator kept at 
a temperature of 37 C. Evidently, therefore, the strength of this 
ferment in cows' milk is so small as to be insignificant, and, more- 
over, the digestive juices are much richer in amylase than is milk. 

Salolase. This substance has not so far been found in cows' 
milk, but it has been almost universally found in human milk 
by those who have investigated its presence. There is some doubt 
as to its true nature, since certain observers have stated that the 
reaction is still present after the milk has been boiled, which would 
not be the case were the reaction produced by an enzyme. It is 
difficult to postulate any value for this property of human milk 
in the nutrition of the infant, since salol is not present in milk 
nor in the infant's stomach. If it is not due to a ferment, it must 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 75 

be regarded as a property of milk which, if of any value, will 
emphasise the necessity for breast-feeding, but, since it is absent 
in cows' milk, can play no part in the nutrition of the infant fed 
artificially on cows' milk.

CHAPTER V 

THE SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 

A. THE FERMENTS OR ENZYMES 

THE literature upon the subject-matter of this chapter would fil^ 
many volumes. Many authors have dealt with the different 
varieties of enzymes present, and have investigated the mechanism 
of their actions. Much of the literature, however, is concerned 
with other aspects arising out of the occurrence of the ferments, 
such as the detection of the heating of milk, the presence of disease 
in the udder of the cow, or of the number of bacteria present in 
the milk. All these aspects will need to^ be considered, although 
some will be briefly dealt with. 

The ferments which have been found in milk can be placed 
under two main headings : i, those which might act upon the 
foodstuffs present in milk, thus aiding its digestion, and 2, those 
which might assist in the oxidising and reducing processes in the 
body. The former group will be considered first. 

The ferments which might act upon substances present in 
milk will fall into the following groups . 

(1) Proteolytic. 

(2) Lipolytic. 

(3) Lactase. 



76 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

Proteolytic Ferments. In Cows' Milk. A fair number of investi- 
gations have been carried out with a view to ascertaining whether 
proteolytic enzymes were present in milk. Prolonged investiga- 
tions were carried out by Babcock, Vivian and Russell (i, 2, 3, 4) 
(1898 and 1899), by Freudenreich (1900), and by Boekout and De 
Vries (i, 2) (1899-1901), all of which were more directly connected 
with the ripening of cheese than with proteolytic enzymes in milk 
as such. Babcock and his collaborators collected the milk carefully, 
but no initial bacterial count was made, and the milk was at once 
treated with an antiseptic. The experiments were carried out 
over prolonged periods (weeks or months), the amount of soluble 
nitrogen present at the beginning and end of the experiment being 
used as a basis for determining the presence of proteolytic enzymes. 

Freudenreich (1900), who sterilised the milk with ether, obtained 
no increase in the soluble nitrogen within one month, although a 
slight increase occurred if the experiment was carried over more 
prolonged periods. 

Boekout and De Vries (i, 2) found that cheese made from pasteur- 
ised milk did not ripen, and that the increase of soluble nitrogen 
which occurs is very small compared with that which occurs with 
cheese made from raw milk. Bacteria appear to have been present 
in both forms of milk, and they conclude that the proteolytic 
activity observed was due to the action of bacteria. 

Babcock and Russell (i, 2) obtained evidence of the formation 
of albumoses and peptone, but they point out that the products 
of proteolytic activity, which were ammonia, amides, and peptones 
are suggestive rather of bacterial than of enzyme action. 

Moro (3) (1902) carried out investigations of the action of milk 
upon fibrin suspended in this fluid. He obtained evidence of 
traces of proteolytic activity, but the milk was not known to be 
free from bacteria. 

Zaitschek (1904) was unable to demonstrate any degree of 
proteolytic activity other than such as might be within the limits 
of experimental error. The small amount of activity found by 
Moro is probably due to the same fact. 

A. J. J. Vandevelde (i), working both alone and with De Waele 
and Sugg, used milk which was not sterile, but to which acetone- 
iodoform solution was added. The experiments were carried out 
over fairly long periods, in no case less than five days, and some 
evidence of proteolytic activity was found. The degree of action 
was, however, very variable. 

In none of these observations was initially sterile milk used, 
and there is no evidence to show that the proteolytic activity was 
not due to bacteria present in the milk. The addition of antiseptics 
does not preclude this possibility, since, although the bacteria them- 
selves may be killed by the antiseptic, yet between the time of 
milking and the time of their death they may conceivably have pro- 
duced proteolytic enzymes, which are not destroyed by antiseptics. 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 77 

The work of Spolverini (i) and Snyder may also be consulted. 

Experiments undertaken by me for a report to the Local Govern- 
ment Board failed to show any evidence of the presence of proteo- 
lytic action in the milk. The milk was collected by a milking tube, 
and was free from bacteria ; 50 c.c. of milk was incubated for 
24-26 hours at 37 C. The protein was subsequently precipitated 
and a portion of the nitrate examined for soluble nitrogen. Controls 
were also used. In no case was any increase of soluble nitrogen 
obtained as a result of the incubation. 

In Human Milk. The same remarks as to the presence of 
bacteria in the milk of cows are applicable here. The earlier 
observers, Spolverini (i, 2) (1902), Moro (3) (1902), Friedjung and 
Hecht (1903), stated that proteolytic activities were to be found in 
human milk. The milk, however, does not appear to have been free 
from bacteria. 

Zaitschek was unable to detect any proteolytic activity in human 
milk, as was also Austin, who worked upon the milk of twenty-one 
women in different states of health. Austin obtained no hydrolysis 
of protein even after fourteen to sixteen days, and he concludes 
(i) that there is no evidence of auto-digestion of human milk, at least 
under the conditions appertaining to such digestion in organ tissues, 
and (2) that the digestive disturbances of infants fed upon human 
milk can have no relation to such an enzyme, as the milk of both 
healthy and sick women was examined. 

Muller and Jochmann investigated the presence of proteolytic 
activity in colostrum expressed from the breast both before and after 
the birth of the child. They used a nutrient medium, consisting of 
blood, serum, and bouillon, in Petri dishes, the evidence of proteolytic 
activity being shown by any impairment of surface. These authors 
found that there was constant evidence of proteolytic activity in 
the fluid expressed in the last two months of pregnancy and in the 
early days after birth, but that this subsequently fell very rapidly, 
being small after the first few days and generally absent by the 
eleventh day. They believe that this action is due to the colostrum 
corpuscles. In view of the probability that some of the colostrum 
corpuscles are leucocytes, there is no difficulty in supposing that this 
ferment is present in colostrum, since leucocytes are known to show 
proteolytic activity. 

Grimmer (i) investigated the presence of proteolytic ferments 
in the resting and active gland of a number of animals. He found 
that some degree of auto-digestion does take place in the tissue. 
He does not suggest the possibility of this action being bacterial 
in nature, and believes that it is present in the cells of the gland. 
The action was at all times too weak to have any effect upon foreign 
proteins, and was less marked in the resting gland than in the 
active gland. He also showed the presence of an ereptase which 
was capable of splitting polypeptides, with tyrosin as one of the 
products. 



78 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

The general evidence as to the presence of proteolytic enzymes 
in human or cows' milk tends to show that such enzymes are not 
present, except possibly in colostrum. The only reliable work is 
evidently that where the milk has been collected initially free from 
bacteria, in view of the presence of bacteria in the fluid examined. 

A few authors believe that, apart from enzymes acting upon 
protein substances in milk, there is another enzyme acting on 
polypeptides. But here again, the milk used for the purpose of 
experiment was not initially sterile, but was treated with anti- 
septics. 

Wohlgemuth and Strich found evidence of the hydrolysis 
of glycyl-tryptophane when this substance was added to both 
human and cows' milk, as also did Warfield for human milk. 

Grimmer (5) thinks it possible that this ferment may occur only 
in the active gland, and that some degree of activity in the splitting 
of polypeptides, which was obtained by him in the resting gland, 
may be due to an additional proteolytic action, since the break- 
down products obtained were different. The value of such a 
ferment, if it exists at all, is probably negligible, especially in 
view of the absence of proteolytic ferments in the milk itself. 

Lipolytic Ferments. On the Presence of Lipase in Cows' Milk. 
Spolverini, . (i, 2) Luzzati and Biolchini (1902), also Marfan and 
Gillet (1902), found that cows' milk was capable of splitting 
monobutyrin into butyric acid and glycerine. The action Marfan 
and Gillet found to be specific for this substance ; oil was not acted 
upon at all, nor other compounds of butyrin. 

Moro (3) (1902) found that cows' milk had the power of splitting 
olive oil. The method used by him is not, however, sufficiently 
accurate to be convincing, the presence of fatty acid being tested 
for by the formation of an emulsion when alkali was added. 

Leperre (1904) was unable to trace any decrease in fat content 
even after several weeks, the other constituents of the milk being, 
however, altered in quantity. 

A. J. J. Vandevelde (2) (1907) determined the acidity of the milk 
as a test for the formation of fatty acids. The milk was treated 
with the acetone-iodoform mixture used by him, and after in- 
cubation was distilled. No change in the acidity of the distillate 
could be detected even after several weeks. 

On the Presence of Lipase in Human Milk. Spolverini, Luzzati, 
and Biolchini, also Marfan and Gillet, all found monobutyrinase 
in human milk. 

Friedjung and Hecht (1903) also found the same, but did not 
investigate the presence of an autolytic lipase. 

Hippius (1905), using Mankowsky's reagent for the detection 
of the presence of fatty acids, believed that human milk was capable 
of splitting olive oil. This reaction was destroyed by heating 
to 64 C. 

Davidsohn (i) found that the surface tension was reduced in 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 79 

human milk on standing, the reduction being more marked when the 
milk was put to stand in the cold. He attributes this phenomenon 
to the action of a lipase, and confirmed his results by using the 
stalagmometric method, which depends upon the number of drops 
falling per minute. Davidsohn points out that this phenomenon 
fits well with Ellenbeck's remarks upon the development of a 
stable haemolysin in human milk when this milk is allowed to stand 
in the cold. Neuberg and Reichert had previously shown that 
haemolysins and immune sera had lipolytic activities. It 
seems, therefore, that there is a connection between the lipase 
and an apparent haemolytic activity of milk. The presence of 
lipase in blood and in serum has been shown by Rona and 
Michaelis, and has been further investigated by Bauer, and also 
by Davidsohn (2). 

Samelsohn found a strong lipolytic activity in the blood of 
infants of from two months to two years of age. The ferment 
was capable of splitting tributyrin. Less activity was shown 
by the blood of two atrophic children than by that of healthy 
children. It may probably be regarded as established that the 
ferment in blood and that in the milk are identical, although the 
amount present in the milk is very much less than that in the blood. 
The ferment probably reaches the milk by filtration. 
It |0n the Presence of Lactase and Glycolytic Ferments in Milk. 
Spolverini (1902) found evidence of glycolysis present in all 
the milks examined by him ; Zaitschek, however (1904), found 
no change in reducing power on incubation, except in the case of 
bacterial contamination, and he hence considered that Spolve- 
rini's results must have been due to this cause. 

Stocklasa (1904) prepared a ferment solution from milk by 
means of alcoholic precipitation, which he considered had lactose- 
splitting power. The milk used was not initially sterile, but 
was preserved by means of antiseptics ; 50 c.c. of a 40 per cent, 
solution of lactose was used for each experiment, and the amount 
of lactose lost varied from '32--68 gramme. The experiments 
were carried out over from three to five days, at 37 C. 

A. J. J- Vandevelde (3) (1908) believed that he had evidence of 
the presence in milk of a glycolytic ferment. The milk was not 
initially sterile, but was disinfected by means of iodoform and 
acetone. The amount of lactose present was estimated both by 
the polarimeter and by Fehling's method. There was no increase 
in reducing power, so that the lactose was not split into dextrose 
and galactose. The fluids used were found to be bacterial-free 
as a result of the addition of the disinfecting agent. Vandevelde 
carried his experiments over prolonged periods, and the amount 
of sugar lost, even after many months, was inconsiderable, and 
only occurred in the acetone-iodoform samples. The samples 
preserved with formol showed no change, or so little as to be 
negligible. Thus

In another case, after treatment with antiseptics, there was a 
decrease of 0-362 per cent, of lactose in three years and five months. 

This work of Stocklasa's and Vandevelde's is open to the 
objection that the milk was not obtained free from bacterial con- 
tamination, but was only rendered sterile afterwards. The varieties 
of bacteria which will ferment lactose are very numerous, and 
it is, therefore, not unlikely that traces of ferment action might 
occur in the solution in presence of the bacteria killed by means 
of the antiseptics. 

The only value that lactase in milk could have for the infant, 
must consist in the ferment acting with some rapidity upon the 
lactose within the first few hours. For this purpose the twenty- 
seven days of Vandevelde's experiment have no significance, espe- 
cially in view of the very small amount of sugar decomposed. 

It was shown by Aders Plimmer (1906) that lactase is present 
in the alimentary canal at birth, and in some animals just before 
birth, in considerable amount, compared with which the strength 
of ferment obtained in milk by Stocklasa and Vandevelde fades 
into complete insignificance. Various authors have also detected 
lactase in the alimentary canal of new-born infants. 1 Even if a 
ferment of the strength found by these observers is present in 
milk collected free from bacterial contamination, it is difficult 
to believe that it could have any biological value whatever. For 
this reason it will not be considered any further. 

The Second Group of ferments will now be considered. 

On the Presence of Oxidising Ferments in Milk. The presence 
of an oxidising body in cows' milk was first mentioned by Klebs 
(1868). In the work by subsequent observers the action now 
known to be due to the ferment catalase appears to have been 
confused with that of the ferment now known as peroxidase. 
Babcock and Russell (i, 2) demonstrated the presence of the two 
reactions, but believed that they were both manifestations of pro- 
teolytic activity. These authors worked with a ferment solution 
prepared by them from milk. The failure to differentiate between 
these two reactions led to considerable confusion in the work of the 
earlier observers. Raudnitz (i) in 1898 stated his belief that the 
two reactions were due to separate bodies, and this was further 
conclusively shown by Loew (i) (1901) and Neumann-Wender (i) in 
1903.

SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES' OF MILK 81 

After it had been shown that catalase and peroxidase were 
separate ferments, further difficulties arose because the reaction 
with guaiacum tincture was found to show two different phases. 
Some milks gave the reaction at once on the addition of guaiacum 
tincture, while in other cases it was necessary to add hydrogen 
peroxide, and for some time it was considered that these different 
phases were due to two different enzymes, one of which reacted directly 
with guaiacum tincture and the other did not. Numerous authors 
have investigated this question from varying standpoints, and 
there seems no doubt, at the present time, that the reactions are 
due to the same body. Where the reaction is given directly 
with milk and guaiacum tincture it is due to the formation of a 
peroxide or some similar substance in the guaiacum solution, so 
that the reaction occurs without the addition of the hydrogen 
peroxide. It has been found that this substance is present in 
guaiacum tincture which has been allowed to stand for a prolonged 
period, or has been exposed to the action of certain chemical sub- 
stances. Thus Kowalewsky showed that the reaction occurred 
without addition of H 2 O 2 , when old guaiac tincture, which had 
stood in the light, was used. Bourquelot showed that the addition 
of hydrogen peroxide to the tincture produced the same result. 
Further confirmatory work has been carried out by Neumann- 
Wender (i, 2), Arnost, Waentig (i), and Siegfeld (i). Bach and 
Chodat have also reached the same conclusion, although using some- 
what different terminology, and Moore and Whitley, working with 
vegetable extracts and also with milk, have shown the same. It 
seems, therefore, evident that only one ferment is concerned in the 
reaction with guaiacum tincture. 

The work of Storch has already been referred to fully in the 
summary of this chapter, and in practical work Storch's method of 
using para-phenylene-diamine is more generally used than that with 
guaiacum tincture. The latter, in relation to milk, is now chiefly 
of historical interest. 

In addition to Storch's method, a large number of other sub- 
stances have been used by different authors to demonstrate the 
presence of this ferment. One of the better-known solutions is 
that prepared by Rothenfiisser, who used the hydrochloride of 
para-phenylene-diamine and also a mixture of guaiacol and para- 
phenylene-diamine. For further reference to the reagents employed,

Chlopin, Utz (2, 3, 4), Siegfeld (i), Kastle and Porch. 

On the Presence of Peroxidase in Milk. Cows' Milk. No observer 
has failed to detect the presence of peroxidase in cows' milk, even 
when the milk is collected with such care that it is sterile. Cp. 
Rullmann (4), and Harden and Lane-Claypon. 

Human Milk. Raudnitz (i) (1898) failed to obtain the per- 
oxidase reaction with human milk using guaiacum and hydrogen 
peroxide ; and he showed that this was not due to any inhibitory 



82 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

body, since when human milk was added to cows' milk the 
reaction with the cows' milk took place just as easily. He found, 
however, that human colostrum was active, and that the active 
substance was precipitated with the globulin fraction. It may 
be mentioned that in respect of this last point, Raudnitz found 
the same for cows' milk. 

Moro (3) (1902), using the oxidation of salicylic aldehyde as a 
measure of the oxidising power, obtained negative results with 
human milk. 

Spolverini (2, 3) (1902 and 1904) found a weak reaction with 
human milk, and showed that it became stronger if the milk assumed 
the character of colostrum. He believed that the ferment was 
attached to the leucocytes. 

Nordmann (1902) published a case of a child who was fed upon 
the breast of a mother who was suffering from mastitis. The 
infant did not thrive, and on testing the milk it was found to be 
negative to Storch's reagent. Three samples of milk taken from 
other women gave a positive reaction, and Nordmann apparently 
attributed the infant's lack of progress to the absence of peroxidase. 
This paper produced a reply from Thiemich (1903), who showed 
that the presence of peroxidase is altogether uncertain. He 
examined the milk of a large number of women attending the 
Breslauer Klinik, and found that whilst it was usually present it 
was very inconstant. 

Marfan and Gillet (1902) found that the reaction is present 
in colostrum, but disappears as the gland gets into full work ; if, 
however, the gland is allowed to become less active, then the 
peroxidase again appears, and with it the leucocytes ; the peroxi- 
dase reaction may, however, appear rather earlier than the leuco- 
cytes. They found further that if milk giving the peroxidase 
reaction be examined under the microscope, on the addition of 
guaiacum and hydrogen peroxide, the area around the nucleus 
of the polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes became blue. The fluid 
around also showed a faint bluish tinge, so that, apparently, the 
substance can pass out. 

Gillet, carrying this work further, showed that the presence of 
peroxidase is due to leucocytes, and that it is found both in the 
fluid and in the sediment of centrifuged milk. 

He also examined the milk from a large number of women, 
and found, as Thiemich did, that the reaction was extremely 
uncertain ; it varied even in the milk from the two breasts. 

Friedjung and Hecht (1903), working on the milk from a large 
number of women, found that the reaction was negative in 114 
out of 174 samples of milk examined, and varied greatly in intensity 
when present. As a whole the reaction was more marked in colostral 
milk, but it was often absent even there. 

Jolles (1904) was so entirely unable to detect the presence 
of peroxidase in human milk that he suggested that the test should 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 83 

be used as a means of distinguishing cows' milk from human 
milk. 

Kastle and Porch (1908) found the results of the peroxidase 
reaction very uncertain with human milk, even with the addition 
of their sensitiser trikresol ; the colostral stage appeared to have, 
as a whole, greater activity than the later milk. 

Mechanism of the Peroxidase Reaction. Much work has been 
done upon the mechanism of the peroxidase reaction. Peroxi- 
dase is present throughout the animal and vegetable kingdom, 
but has not been found as a result of bacterial action. 1 The 
mechanism of this action has aroused the attention not only of 
dairy chemists but also of botanists and biological chemists. 
Solutions have been prepared by several investigators from plants 
and from milk, and there is strong evidence that all these solutions 
contain small quantities of iron and possibly also traces of 
manganese. The iron is said to be present in colloidal form, and 
Sarthou (i, 3) showed that the reaction can be brought about when 
the solution contains as small an amount as -0002 per cent, of iron.* 
Other investigators, who have incidentally confirmed the results 
obtained by the above authors, have shown that the reaction was 
of the same nature as that of a metallic sol and that, although 
the solution was inactivated by boiling, it could be reactivated 
by appropriate methods, such as the addition of platinsol, or by 
projecting milk in a fine jet at a high pressure on to an agate plate, 
or by the addition of pumice. 8 Rohman and Shmamine believe 
that iron and other salts, as also certain organic bodies, have an 
affinity for hydrogen peroxide, to which they become attached. 
They believe that this probably occurs also with organic peroxides, 
and that this method of action may account for the action of the 
iron in the peroxidase reaction. 

Some discussion has occurred between Grimmer (2, 3, 4, 6) and 
Kooper (i, 2, 3, 4) and Hesse and Kooper (i, 2, 3) in regard to the 
method of action of the peroxidase in milk. Kooper and Hesse 
worked with Rothenfusser's reagent, and believed that the reaction 
was dependent upon the alkalinity of the milk. Grimmer did not 
agree with this suggestion, and believed that the reaction was 
produced by a ferment, and that this ferment was connected with 
the albumin fraction of the protein in milk. The discussion has 
been continued for a considerable period, and neither of the authors 
appears to be convinced by the arguments of the other. Grimmer 
agrees that the reaction is affected by the alkalinity or acidity of 
the milk before boiling, but that it depends in reality upon the 
denaturalisation of the albumin. 

Several observers have investigated the possibility of this 
reaction being due to bacteria present in the milk, but all have

failed to obtain the reaction in bacterial cultures so far investigated, 
although it was shown by Jensen to be present inside the cells of 
Oidium Lactis and Penicillium Glaucum. 1 

A good deal of work has been done in order to ascertain which 
of the constituents of the milk was primarily concerned with the 
reaction. Observers are to some extent divided in their opinion as 
to whether the caseinogen or the albumin is primarily concerned, but 
it would appear that the latter is the one most probably connected 
with the production of this effect. Thus Klebs, Raudnitz (2, 3, 4), 
Barthel (i), Bordas and Touplain (i, 2) believed that caseinogen was 
concerned in the peroxidase reaction, while Kowalewsky believed 
that it was connected with lactalbumin. Monvoisin found the 
reaction positive in the filtrate obtained after saturation with 
magnesium sulphate. Meyer showed that the reaction was not 
given by caseinogen alone, but that a positive reaction was obtained 
with cream from centrifuged milk as well as with the milk remaining 
behind, and also slightly with the sediment. Kooper (i) did not 
obtain the peroxidase reaction with cream, and Sames showed that 
the reaction was strongest in the first milk (that poorest in cream) and 
was often absent in the strippings (that richest in cream.) Sames 
also showed that the reaction was probably connected with the 
albumin fraction. Grimmer (i) showed that a solution prepared 
by saturating whey with ammonium sulphate, and subsequently 
dissolving the precipitate thus obtained, gave a strong peroxidase 
reaction. 

The Effect of Heat upon the Peroxidase Reaction. In using 
this reaction for the purpose of detecting the previous heating of 
milk, it is necessary to know at what temperature this reaction ceases 
to be given. The numerous observations upon this point are by 
no means concordant. It is not possible to deal in detail with the 
various results obtained, but the accompanying table, compiled in 
great measure from the tables given by Waentig (2) (1907) and van 
Eck (1911), will show the most essential points. It illustrates the 
great difficulty of deciding upon the precise temperature at which the 
reaction ceases to be given, and therefore the exact temperature 
to which the milk may be considered to have been heated. 

Van Eck (1911) arranged a series of test-tubes containing varying 
amounts of raw and sterilised milk. (The sterilised milk was heated 
to 100 C. for half an hour.) The series ranged from 9-9 c.c. sterilised 
milk and 'I c.c. raw, to 8 c.c. raw and 2 c.c. sterilised. After adding 
equal amounts of the reagent (Storch's test was used), these tubes 
formed a scale of colour which was used for each experiment as a 
standard colour scale, the colour depending upon the amount of 
fresh milk that is, upon the amount of ferment present in each tube. 

He then took some of the same milk and heated it gradually 
in a water-bath fitted with a stirrer, and, taking samples at different 

1 Cp. also Bellei. 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 85 

temperatures and intervals, he compared them with the standard 
colour scale for that experiment. 

Using the values thus obtained, he found that the reaction 
followed the law for monomolecular reactions, and that the equation 

K = - log,.-^ (where K = a constant, and a = concentration 
T a, x 

at time O, x = concentration at time T), was true, and that hence 
the reaction was monomolecular in type. The effect evidently 
depends upon the length of time over which the heat is maintained,

and van Eck points out that it is impossible with any one test to 
discover both the temperature and the length of time of heating. 

There is no means of testing the amount of peroxidase present 
in milk ; van Eck's work deals with the disappearance of such 
amounts of peroxidase as are present in the particular sample of 
milk considered, and not with absolute quantities. Further, the 
test for peroxidase can readily be restored to heated milk by the 
addition of a small amount of raw milk, if the presence of the reaction 
is required. 

On the Presence of Reducing Ferments in Milk. The reductases 
are bodies whose action consists in bringing about the chemical 
reduction of a given substance. 



86 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

Their action is most easily detected if the substance used changes 
colour as a result of the reduction. For this reason methylene 
blue has been found satisfactory, and has been largely, although 
not exclusively, used in the investigation of the presence of these 
ferments in milk. Methylene blue has been used alone in which 
case, if it is reduced, the ferment or body causing such reduction 
is known as a ' direct reductase. ' It has also been used with formalin, 
and the resulting reduction is said to be brought about by an 
'indirect reductase.' This last body has also been called ' aldehyde- 
catalase,' 'aldehyde-reductase,' 'formaldehydase,' and it has also 
been suggested by Bach (i, 2) that, following the general type of 
nomenclature, ' redukase ' would be more appropriate. Further, in- 
asmuch as the reaction was first discovered by Schardinger (i), it is 
often known as 'Schardinger's reaction,' and on the assumption that 
the body is a ferment it is known as ' Schardinger's ferment.' 
These two reactions are most frequently denoted by the letters 
M.B. (methylene blue) and F.M.B. (formalin - methylene - blue) 
respectively. 

In addition to these two substances some authors have dealt 
with a third reducing agent, hydrogenase, which converts sulphur 
into sulphuretted hydrogen. This action will be considered after 
the direct and indirect reductases. 

The reducing power of milk was shown in 1897 by Vaudin using 
indigo, and also by Neisser and Wechsberg (1900) for methylene 
blue, and by Wynter Blyth (1901) using litmus. 

The literature dealing with the reducing ferments began on a 
considerable scale about 1902, and since this date a vast number 
of papers have been published dealing with various aspects of the 
reducing power of milk. The question has been further complicated 
by a considerable amount of controversy, which cannot be said to 
be altogether closed at the present time. It will probably simplify 
the consideration of the various issues which have been studied 
in connection with this class of bodies in milk, if a short history of 
the literature be given first. 

Schardinger (i) in 1902 published his first paper on the reducing 
properties of milk. He showed that when milk was quite fresh it 
did not reduce methylene blue unless formalin was added to the 
solution. The solution used by him for this test was made up of : 

5 c.c. saturated solution of methylene blue, 
5 c.c. formalin, 
190 c.c. water, 

and is known generally as Schardinger's reagent or solution. 
Schardinger concluded that (i) either an aldehyde substance was 
necessary for the reduction of the methylene blue, which was 
ordinarily formed gradually in the milk by the action of bacteria, 
being replaceable in the early stages by formaldehyde or some other 



SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES' OF MILK 87 

similar substance, or (2) that the reaction was due to the ' living 
protoplasm ' of the bacteria. He believed the latter to be a more 
likely explanation. 

This latter view was also that of Cathcart and Hahn, who in 
the same year had demonstrated the power of many bacteria to 
reduce methylene blue, and who believed that the property was 
probably attached to the protoplasm of the cell. 

Schardinger's reaction was most marked at a temperature of 
45-5o C., the colour usually disappearing within thirty minutes 
after incubation. 

Schardinger's work showed that it was likely there were two 
separate actions in milk connected with the reduction of methylene 
blue. Schardinger himself believed that this reduction could be 
used as a means for detecting the difference between raw and 
boiled milk. For a time, work upon the reduction of methylene 
blue was concentrated upon this latter point, but no decisive result 
was obtained. Gradually the work turned more particularly upon 
the cause of the two reactions of methylene blue, and it was shown 
by numerous observers that Schardinger's reaction was probably 
due to a ferment, the reduction of methylene blue alone being due 
to bacteria. 

Another series of observations was concerned with endeavouring 
to utilise the reduction of methylene blue alone, as a method of 
estimating the number of bacteria present. The efforts, however, 
resulted in failure. 

On the Differentiation between Direct and Indirect Beductase. 
A number of investigators have followed up Schardinger's 
original paper in regard to the differentiation between the reaction 
with F.M.B. in fresh milk and the reaction with M.B. alone, in milk 
which has been kept for some hours. 

Smidt (i) showed that there were three factors in milk 
which could bring about the reduction of methylene blue (he 
appears to have regarded this action as a catalytic one). 

These three factors were : 

1. Lactose, or other substances which became alkaline on 

boiling, 

2. Ferments, and 

3. Bacteria. 

Smidt showed that fresh milk a few hours after milking 
gave a positive reaction with Schardinger's reagent but not with 
methylene blue alone. The reaction with formalin-methylene 
blue was weakened by heating to 70 C. and destroyed by heating 
to 75 C. for twenty minutes. He considered this reaction to be 
due to a ferment which he called aldehyde-catalase. 

The rate of reduction of methylene blue alone, depended upon 
the number of bacteria present and was in direct relation to it. 



88 



MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



He also showed that lactose in alkaline solution at 45-5o C. 
gives decolorisation in a few minutes, and methylene blue is reduced 
when milk is boiled for about fifteen minutes, provided the dye is 
added at boiling temperature or before boiling. 

He therefore considered that the reaction with formalin-methy- 
lene-blue was different in origin from that with methylene blue 
alone. 

In effect Smidt's views have been almost universally acknow- 
ledged to be correct, although a vast amount of labour has been 
bestowed upon the subject since his paper appeared. 

Following Smidt's work, Seligmann (2, 4) endeavoured to show 
that both reactions were due to bacteria, but his results as regards 
the F.M.B. reaction have not been confirmed by subsequent workers. 

Jensen showed that numerous organisms commonly present in 
milk can produce a direct reductase. He found that really pure 
milk did not reduce M.B., but only F.M.B. Koning's investiga- 
tions also showed the same, as did those of Butterberg and 
Brand. Similar results were also obtained by Oppenheimer and 
Sommerfeld. The observations of Oppenheimer showed that when 
milk is fresh and has been carefully collected so as to be free 
from bacterial contamination, F.M.B. is reduced within fifteen 
minutes at 50 C. and within seven and a quarter minutes at 70 C. 
The rate of reduction was found to have no connection with the 
bacterial content. 

Sommerfeld, Barthel (3, 4, 5) and Schroeter endeavoured to obtain 
a relationship between the rate of reduction of methylene blue alone 
and the number of bacteria present. The matter was also dealt 
with by Jensen, and results have been tabulated by Barthel (5) and 
are given below. No relationship is shown between the reduction 
time and the bacteria present.

Fred investigated the reducing power of twenty-two strains 
of bacteria found in milk. Of the twenty-two used, twenty-one 



SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES' OF MILK 89 

showed reducing power for methylene blue. He considers that 
if reduction occurs in 

Less than 3 hours the milk is of poor quality. 
In 3-7 hours the milk is of fair quality. 
In over 7 hours the milk is of good quality. 

Reduction in less than one hour, i.e. a quarter or half an hour, 
denotes a bacterial content of fifteen to twenty millions ; if the period 
is over seven hours the content will be less than one million per c.c. 

Bertin-Sans and Ganjoux (2) were unable to establish any relation- 
ship between the reduction time and the bacterial content. Their 
results, however, agree generally with those of Fred, as they consider 
that milk which reduces M.B. in a quarter of an hour must be 
regarded as bad, and pasteurised milk should not effect reduction in 
less than seven hours. 

Schardinger's Reaction. The importance of a reliable test 
for boiled milk in contradistinction to raw milk has already been 
pointed out, and it has been shown that the peroxidase reaction 
has been largely used for this purpose. Evidently, when the 
boiled milk can have the property upon which the test rests restored 
by some artificial means after it has been boiled, the value of the 
test is almost at once negatived. 

Utz pointed out that the results obtained with Schardinger's 
reagent depended upon the alkalinity of the milk. Milk, when 
fresh, has an alkaline reaction, but stale milk having an acid re- 
action did not give the F.M.B. test. Utz (2, 3), however, showed 
that the reduction could be restored even in sour milk by the addition 
of an alkali. If this is the case, evidently Schardinger's test 
cannot be regarded as a reliable one for the previous boiling of 
milk. 

The matter was further considered by Siegfeld (2), who believed 
it to be unreliable, and by Rullmann (2, 5), who believed that the 
reaction was positive even after the milk had been heated to 68 C. 1 

Several later observers have dealt with the restoration of the 
Schardinger reaction by the addition of alkali and also by the 
addition of an iron solution to milk which has been boiled. Brand 
showed that the addition of alkali, even to raw milk, aids the 
F.M.B. reaction, which cannot be reproduced in boiled milk by 
this means. Koning confirmed these results, but showed further 
that the addition of lactose to sterilised or boiled milk is capable 
of restoring the F.M.B. reaction. 

Romer and Sames showed that even when milk has ceased to 
give Schardinger's reaction it will at once do so if a small amount 
of i per cent, solution of ferrous sulphate be added. The reaction, 
however, is negative if the ferrous sulphate has been previously 

1 Cp. also Utz (5), Schardinger (2). 



go MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

boiled. The solution alone does not reduce F.M.B. in water 
solution. 

Wedemann showed that the milk of goats (which has been 
found by numerous observers to contain no ferment capable of 
reducing the F.M.B. solution) will give reduction on the addition 
of alkali in sufficient quantities to be alkaline to lackmus or on 
the addition of ferrous sulphate. He confirmed the presence of 
this ferment in cows' milk. 

Rullmann (3, 4) showed that formic acid could replace formalde- 
hyde in the reduction of the F.M.B. reaction. He first showed that 
the addition of lactose to soda had an appreciable effect in reducing 
the time required for reduction both of M.B. and of F.M.B. in 
boiled or sterilised milk. He also showed that lactose alone does 
not produce this effect. 

Rullmann also carried out a number of investigations relating 
to the restoration of the reaction in boiled milk or sterilised milk. 
He concludes that there is a substance present in milk which is 
capable of bringing about the reduction of Schardinger's reagent 
at 45-50 C. apart from bacteria, and that this substance is 
probably a ferment ; that reduction of the same reagent can also 
be brought about at higher temperatures by substances present 
in milk, i.e. lactose and salts, which probably assist in the reduc- 
tion of the reagent at the lower temperature. The presence of a 
ferment which reduces Schardinger's reagent, in milk obtained free 
from bacteria, first shown by Rullmann, was confirmed by Harden 
and Lane-Claypon. 

Bum and Kursteiner carried out prolonged observations upon 
the Schardinger reaction, and they confirmed the belief of previous 
authors that the reaction is due to the presence of a ferment whose 
action can be simulated by the addition of alkali or ferrous 
sulphate. They suggest the name ' formaldehydase ' for the 
ferment concerned. They believe that the length of time required 
for reduction depends upon the presence or absence of oxygen, 
being prolonged when oxygen is present and curtailed when oxygen 
is removed. Burri and Schmid had also shown in 1911 that 
milk of a lower bacterial content, 10,000 to 30,000 per c.c., shows 
a reduction in the time required for the Schardinger reaction if 
it is cooled to 12 C. or boiled before testing. The authors 
connected this alteration in reduction time with changes occur- 
ring in the fat globules on cooling, described by Burri and 
Nussbaumer. 

Lagane (i) found this ferment present in cows' milk unless the 
cow is in poor health or unless she had not been milked recently. 
The blue colour reappeared after reduction in from two to four 
hours, being more rapid when there is a greater exposure of the 
surface to the air. This seems to harmonise with the findings 
of Burri and Kursteiner. Lagane showed that the sediment 
gave no reduction, the reaction depending upon the fat. The 



SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES' OF MILK 91 

phenomenon disappears with boiling and is reduced in power by 
heating for fifteen minutes at 80 C. 

If the milk is allowed to stand after the colour has returned, 
this will again disappear owing to the development of bacterial 
activity. 

On the Constituents of the Milk which are concerned in the 
F.M.B. Reaction. Various investigations have been made con- 
cerning the relation of indirect reductase to fat or to leucocytes. 
Generally, there appears to be agreement in regard to the relation 
between the ferment and fat globules. Seligmann (2, 4) showed 
this in 1905-6, and was confirmed by Jensen, who gives results 
shown in the following table :

Brand believed that the ferment was only in part attached 
to the cream, since some action was obtained in the milk after 
the cream had been removed. Monvoisin, on different grounds, 
did not believe that it was attached exclusively to the fat globules. 
Koning stated that colostrum reduced F.M.B. more slowly than 
ordinary milk, while Smidt (2) agreed with the previous observers 
who had shown that the reductase for F.M.B. goes up in the cream 
on centrifuging, and cannot be washed away from it. 

Sassenhagen finds that the F.M.B. reaction is not given by 
colostrum, but may be obtained in the later colostral period with

tion of the mechanism of this reaction falls outside the scope 
of the present work. Investigations by Bredig and Sommer, 
Bach (1,2), Paal and Gerum suggest that the action of this fer- 
ment in milk is probably identical with that of the metallic sols. 
Further details are given in my report to the Local Government 
Board, New Series, 76. 



92 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

On the Presence of Reductases in Human Milk. The amount 
of work which has been done upon the reducing substances in 
human milk is small, but enough has been done to obtain reliable 
information in this direction. It is much easier to obtain human 
milk free from any great degree of bacterial contamination than 
cows' milk, although the amount obtained is small. 

Gillet (1902), using Abelous and Girard's method of testing 
for reduction by the conversion of nitrates to nitrites, obtained 
negative results. 

Hecht (1904), who worked exclusively with human milk, obtained 
reduction of methylene blue alone, in from one to two days, but he 
was not sure that his samples were sterile, and does not appear 
to have controlled them by plating out. The time of reduction 
is entirely in accord with the reduction by bacteria, and by no 
other agency. In one case where special precautions were taken 
to ensure sterility no reduction was obtained. Reduction was 
stopped by a temperature of from 6o-8o C. Above this temperature 
reducing powers again appeared on prolonged heating, presumably 
due to the lactose. 

Hecht does not appear to have used Schardinger's reagent, 
and his results were most probably due to bacterial growth. 

Rullmann (2), Smidt (i), Koning and Sassenhagen, using Schar- 
dinger's reagent, obtained negative results with human milk. 

Hydrogenase in Cows' Milk. There remains one more substance 
to consider under the heading of reducing bodies, namely hydro- 
genase, or that ferment which has the property of forming 
sulphuretted hydrogen from sulphur. 

The literature is not inconsiderable, and the results are quite 
conclusive. In 1891 Rosing, in the course of his researches into 
the production of H 2 S from egg-white, found that if sulphur was 
added to milk it was sometimes possible to obtain the reaction 
for sulphuretted hydrogen ; the result was, however, sometimes 
negative. 

Raudnitz (3) (1902) in his excellent resume of the literature deals 
briefly with the question of hydrogenase, and states that he him- 
self had not been able to detect H 8 S in milk on the addition of 
sulphur ; the same was also stated by Schardinger (1902). 

Utz (i) (1903) obtained H 2 S from milk on the addition of sulphur 
after prolonged boiling. 

Hoeffter (1904), like Rosing, found that fresh milk sometimes 
gave reduction of sulphur ; the negative samples, however, also 
reduced after they had been incubated for one or two days. The 
addition of antiseptics prevented this development, and as a 
result of these and of other experiments, he concludes that the 
development of H 2 S in milk upon the addition of sulphur, is bacterial 
in origin. 

Jensen (1906) also came to the same conclusion. 

Briining (1906) did not detect hydrogenase in fresh milk, but 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 93 

he found that if fresh milk was inoculated with stale milk H 2 S 
appeared on the addition of sulphur. He considered that B. coli 
was especially active in the production of H 2 S from sulphur. 

Rullmann (4) , using milk which was obtained sterile by means of 
the milking-tube, was unable to detect hydrogenase in any case. 
He concluded that the formation of sulphuretted hydrogen from 
sulphur was bacterial in origin. 

Catalase. The ferment to which this name is given has the 
property of splitting hydrogen peroxide with the evolution of 
molecular oxygen, after the equation 

2H 2 O Z = 2H 2 O + O 2 . 

The early investigators did not differentiate catalase from the 
other ferment-actions noticed by them, but observations of Bach 
and Chodat, confirmed by Neumann-Wender (i), showed definitely 
that catalytic activity was separate from the other ferment actions. 

The use of hydrogen peroxide for the preservation of milk 
was suggested by Budde", and the process so introduced is known 
as buddisation. This process was investigated by Chick, who 
worked upon the presence of catalase in milk in order to test the 
value of hydrogen peroxide as a preservative. Chick showed 
that milk had the power of splitting hydrogen peroxide, but that 
the addition of fairly large amounts of this reagent removed this 
power. Concurrently with the disappearance of the reaction, 
the milk became sterile owing to the bacteria being destroyed. 
She showed further that when milk, which had been rendered 
approximately sterile by boiling, received the addition of a small 
amount of raw milk, the capacity for splitting hydrogen peroxide 
gradually returned. These facts pointed to the production of 
catalase by bacteria present in the milk, but did not preclude 
the presence of catalase in the milk apart from that produced by 
bacteria. 

Method of Estimation of Catalase. The amount of catalase 
present in milk is estimated by ascertaining the amount of hydrogen 
peroxide which is split by the enzyme, as measured by the amount 
of oxygen evolved. It is necessary to shake the apparatus used 
at frequent intervals, or a correct estimation of the oxygen is not 
obtained. Evidently also precautions must be taken to equalise 
the pressure inside and outside the apparatus. 

Various authors have designed different methods for the estima- 
tion of catalase. For the most part 10, 15, or 20 c.c. of milk have 
been employed, to which 3 or 5 c.c. of a weak solution of hydrogen 
peroxide have been added. Many observers use a 3 per cent, 
solution of the peroxide ; others have used a weaker solution. 

The apparatus is usually kept in a water-bath, and the experi- 
ment does not extend over a prolonged period. Descriptions of 
the methods used will be found in the papers by Koning, Burri 



94 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

and Staub, Gerber and Ottiker, Kooper (2, 3), Harden and Lane- 
Claypon. 

Kooper showed that the results obtained by the different 
apparatus were not identical, and he endeavoured to obtain a 
correction factor for the different methods, but without appreciable 
success. 

In dairy produce Lobeck's apparatus 1 appears to be the most 
widely used. The disadvantage of this apparatus lies in the absence 
of facilities for adequate shaking, which tends to give inaccurate 
results. For ordinary dairy purposes the estimation need only be 
correct within certain limits, but it is doubtful how far the dairy- 
man, in this country at any rate, places any reliance upon the 
estimation of catalase in determining the quality of the milk. 

Sources of the Catalase found in Cows' Milk. The estima- 
tions of the catalase content of milk showed that the amount of 
catalase increased when the milk was kept. Chick's work, already 
referred to, had indicated bacteria as a probable source of catalase 
in milk. Several observers have investigated the formation of 
catalase by bacteria, and have shown that a large number of these 
organisms produce this enzyme in the course of their growth. 

Seligmann (i, 2, 4) isolated from milk a strain of cocci which 
produce large quantities of catalase on being cultured. Koning 
showed that bacteria will produce catalase, and found, further, that 
these bacteria would not produce peroxidase, and hence deduced that 
catalase and peroxidase were different enzymes. Jensen found 
that a number of organisms would produce catalase. Sarthou (2), 
Kooper (i, 2), and Faitelowitz all showed that the catalase content 
of milk increases with the age of the milk, and they believed that 
this was due to the formation of catalase by bacteria. 

Sarthou showed that catalase was formed if, after heating, 
the milk was inoculated with a lactic-acid-forming organism, and 
Kooper found that milk collected initially with full precautions 
against bacterial contamination had a lower content of catalase. 
If, however, such carefully collected milk was contaminated by 
the addition of a small piece of solid excreta, the catalase content 
rose very greatly. Further, he showed that catalase could be pro- 
duced in boiled milk, if such milk was inoculated with raw milk. 

The increase of catalase in milk can be inhibited by the addition 
of antiseptics, which are well known to prevent the growth of 
bacteria. Faitelowitz used chloroform and formalin for demonstrat- 
ing this fact, and Barthel (3) and Smidt (2), working independently, 
showed that although the milk was rendered sterile by antiseptics, 
catalase was still present, and they believed that probably there 
was some other source of this enzyme, apart from bacteria. The 
milk used by these observers is not stated to have been germ-free. 
In order to establish the presence of any original catalase

SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 95 

in milk, it is necessary to collect samples free from bacteria. This 
was carried out in the first place by Rullmann (1911) and later 
by Harden and Lane-Claypon. The results obtained by these 
observers leave little doubt that even when there are no bacteria 
present, as shown by growth on culture media, or when bacteria 
are present in such small numbers as to be negligible, traces 
of catalase are present in most samples. 

Rullmann (4) used twenty samples of milk, and gives the follow- 
ing figures for the oxygen evolved : 



After i hour . . 
After 12-18 hours 
After 18-24 hours 



Nil, or only a trace. 
0-2-3-8 c.c. 
0-3-3-6 c.c. 



Milk which was not entirely free from bacteria showed the presence 
of rather more catalase when investigated over longer periods, 
than in the case of the sterile samples. 

The results obtained by Harden and Lane-Claypon showed 
considerable variation in even the sterile samples of milk. Using 
50 c.c. of milk, they obtained amounts varying from 3-7 to 6-0 c.c. 
of oxygen when the time was less than four hours in several cases 
less than one hour. 

There can be little doubt that there are two sources of origin 
for the catalase in cows' milk, but the greater part of the catalase 
in ordinary market milk is of bacterial origin. 

Efforts have been made to connect the catalase with one of 
the constituents of milk, and the investigations of several observers 
show that the cream is richer in catalase than other parts of the 
milk. The catalase, however, has been found to be easily removed 
from the cream by washing, so that it seems unlikely that the 
catalase is an integral property of the fat globules. 1 The figures 
given by Jensen upon this matter are interesting and show also 
the absence of relationship between the bacteria present in small 
numbers and the amount of catalase.

96 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

Other observers consider there may be some connection between 
the leucocytes and the amount of catalase, but this cannot be 
considered as definitely proven. 1 

Catalase in Human Milk. Catalase appears not to be uni- 
versally present in human milk although it has been found in 
small quantities in the majority of samples examined. Fried jung 
and Hecht found that while great variety in amount was exhibited, 
the amount being always small, the general average was increased 
in milk having colostral characteristics or in the last portions of 
milk taken from the gland, i.e. in that which is richest in fat. 
V. d.- Velden believed there was some degree of relationship between 
the cell content and the catalase, while the Tordays, working 
together, believed that the catalase content depended in some 
measure upon the health of the mother, being less when the mother 
was in good health. All observers, however, agree that wide varia- 
tions exist in the amount of catalase present, and clinically no 
relationship has been able to be traced between the nutrition of 
the infant and the amount of catalase present in the milk of its 
mother. 

For further information the work of Raudnitz (i), Luzzati and 
Biolchini, Marfan and Gillet, Friedjung and Hecht, Jolles, Bier, 
van der Velden and E. and A. Torday should be compared. 

On the Amount of Catalase as determining the Quality of the 
Milk. Efforts have been made to establish a standard for the 
amount of catalase which should be regarded as normal, or the 
amount which should be regarded as rendering milk unfit for use, 
the catalase content being taken as denoting the presence of certain 
definite numbers of bacteria. No exact standard has been reached, 
although such have been recommended by numerous observers, 
and several authors agree upon the standard which should be 
observed. 

Raudnitz (4) (1903) showed that the amount of catalase present 
in milk was very variable, as did also Koning. Lam, using 10 c.c. 
of milk and 5 c.c. of I per cent. H 2 2 , considered that if more than 
from 0-3 to i c.c. of oxygen were evolved the milk was not good. 
Gerber and Ottiker, using 9 c.c. of milk and 3 c.c. of i per cent. 
H 2 O 2 , gave the standard which might be allowed as from 2-5 to 
3 c.c. of oxygen. If this amount was exceeded they believed 
that there was probably a considerable amount of dirt in the milk 
or that the cow was diseased. Heygendorff and Meurer, and 
Schroeter were unable to obtain any satisfactory standard which 
could be used for the number of bacteria present. The irregularity 
of the figures is shown by Schroeter, who gives the following : 

Bacterial Count Sediment Figure Oxygen given off 

11,775,000 ;25 6-5 c.c. 

12,000,000 -3 2.25 c.c.

SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES' OF MILK 97 

Variations in Catalase Content. The content of catalase is greatly 
increased in inflammatory conditions of the udder, and Kooper (3) 
believes that differences may be detected between the breed of cows 
and the catalase content of milk. There is, further, a general con- 
sensus of evidence to show that the catalase content of milk 
increases when the gland is nearly 'dry/ and also probably in 
colostrum. It appears, therefore, that when the gland is com- 
mencing or ceasing its activity, or when there is inflammation, 
the amount of catalase is usually increased. 

In view of the very large amount of catalase present in blood, 
it is unlikely that no trace of this enzyme would be found in the 
milk, more especially when the blood supplied to the gland is 
probably increased or when the milk supply is running short. 
For further detailed information upon this subject compare the 
work of Bier, Giffhorn, Gerber and Ottiker, Spindler, Koning, 
and Bertin-Sans and Ganjoux (i). 

On the Presence of Amylase. The action of amylase is to 
break down starch or amylum into simpler substances. It appears 
that starch is not converted by this enzyme to a further stage 
than maltose, and that unless this medium be acid (Mellanby and 
Woolley) it remains for the most part in the stage of dextrins. 

Amylase has been shown to be present in milk, and it is probable 
that in this medium starch is not split further than dextrin. The 
difficulties, however, of estimating the end point of this reaction 
in milk are very great, since it is almost impossible to detect the 
formation of minute quantities of maltose. 

Amylase in Cows' Milk. Investigators are not unanimous 
upon the presence of amylase in cows' milk, and it does not appear 
that it is present in more than very small quantities in the milk 
of this species. 

Spolverini (1902) was unable to obtain evidence of the presence 
of amylase in cows' milk, but Zaitschek (1904) found evidence of 
amylolytic activity in all the samples of milk examined by him. 
He estimated the amount of starch hydrolysed by weighing the 
increase of reducing sugar which occurred during incubation, the 
sugar being calculated as maltose. 

Koning (1906) showed that certain bacteria were capable of 
producing amylase, but he believed that the action found by him 
in cows' milk was not due to bacterial contamination. He collected 
the milk with the greatest care and the investigations were carried 
out over short periods only. He found that about -015 to -02 gm. 
of starch was decomposed by 100 c.c. of milk in half an hour. The 
first and middle milks were richer in amylase than the strippings, 
but any increase in strength beyond that given was regarded by 
him as pathological. The activity was destroyed by heating the 
milk for forty-five minutes at 68 C. 

Giffhorn found that 100 c.c. of milk would decompose from -01 
to -25 gm. of starch, the amount of enzyme present being increased 



98 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

in pathological conditions of the udder. He found that the enzyme 
action was destroyed by heating to 65 C. for thirty minutes. 

Wohlgemuth and Strich were unable to obtain evidence of the 
presence of amylase in cows' milk. They showed that in the 
dog, if the pancreatic duct was tied while the animal was in full 
lactation, the amylase content of the blood and subsequently of 
the milk and of the urine increased. The content of the blood was 
always higher than that of the milk. 

Lane-Claypon carried out investigations upon the amylase 
content of sterile cows' milk collected by means of a collecting 
tube. Amylase was found in each experiment, but the amount 
present was small. Ten c.c. of milk were incubated at 37 C. for 
from three to four hours with known quantities of starch, the re- 
action to iodine being tested at the end of the experiment. It was 
found that the 10 c.c. of the milk used were able to split from -ooi 
to -002 gramme of starch in three hours at 37 C. 

Amylase in Human Milk. There appears to be universal 
agreement among observers in regard to the presence of amylase 
in human milk. Investigations were carried out by Moro (i, 2, 3), 
Luzzati and Biolchini, Nobecourt and Sevin, Spolverini, Friedjung 
and Hecht, Zaitschek, Hippius, Wohlgemuth and Strich. All these 
observers obtained positive results, although different methods 
were used. The amount present appears to be greater than has 
been detected in cows' milk, but no precise figures are given by 
any of the authors. 

Lagane (2) (1913) showed that the action of amylase in human 
milk was greatly increased by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. 
Amylolytic activity was also found when hydrogen peroxide was 
added to growing heads of barley. These barley heads contained 
no amylase but a large amount of peroxidase. Lagane therefore 
suggests that the increased activity is due not to a direct action 
of the amylase but to a side action on the peroxidase, which is also 
frequently present in human milk. He believed that with the 
addition of hydrogen peroxide the starch was split to a further 
stage than dextrin and that some maltose was formed. He failed 
to obtain any action with either raw cows' milk or goats' milk, 
even with the addition of hydrogen peroxide. 

It seems therefore that amylase is usually present in human 
milk, and has also been found in cows' milk, although not in every 
case. It is probable that as amylase is known to be present in the 
blood 1 the amylase in milk occurs as the result of filtration. 

On the Presence of a Said-splitting Ferment in Cows' Milk and 
in Human Milk. The discovery by Nobe'court and Merklen in 
1901, that milk was capable of splitting salol into phenol and 
salicylic acid, has received a good deal of attention, and has been 
confirmed by numerous later observers.

SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES' OF MILK 99 

The evidence is not quite in agreement as to the presence of 
this substance in cows' milk, although every observer who has 
studied its presence in human milk is convinced that the reaction 
is always obtained. 

Moro (3) (1902) believed that the reaction is not affected by boil- 
ing, but there is some doubt whether it is due to ferment action. 

Other observers 1 believed that the reaction of the fluid played 
a part in the production of the reaction, while Rullmann (4) (1911), 
using initially sterile cows' milk, was unable to detect any salolase 
and concluded that the reaction, when found, is due to the presence 
of bacteria. 

For further information reference can be had to Spolverini (2), 
Luzzati and Biolchini, Fried Jung and Hecht, Pozzi-Escot, A. J. J. 
Vandevelde (2), Grimmer (i), and Usener. 

In view of the absence of salol in both cows' and human milk 
the splitting of this substance by human milk does not appear to 
be of any importance for the present work. 

Short resumes of the work of most of the authors referred to 
throughout this chapter will be found in my report to the L.G.B., 
New Series, No. 76. 

On an Increase in the Ferment Content of Milk in Abnormal 
Conditions. There is evidence to show that certain of the ferments 
normally present in milk as a result of filtration through from the 
blood stream, are increased in conditions which are connected with 
an abnormal condition of the gland and possibly also of the cow. 
Such conditions arise towards the end of lactation, when the milk 
assumes a character frequently approximating to that of serum, 
and also in conditions of inflammation of the udder, or mastitis. 

Thus Kostler believed that a high catalase content in freshly 
collected milk denoted illness of the cow. He pointed out, how- 
ever, that a high content in fresh milk must not be confused with 
the catalase content of milk which had been allowed to stand, when 
the catalase would probably be due to bacterial action. 

Sassenhagen found a more powerful reaction with Schardinger's 
reagent when mastitis was present than was the case in ordinary 
milk. 

Vollrath investigated the ferment content of milk from fifty- 
four cows, some of whom had disease of the udder, others being 
the victims of a general malady. He found, generally, no change 
in the amount of peroxidase present, but there was frequently a 
definite rise in the amount of reductase and catalase. This occurred 
in cases also of foot-and-mouth disease. This author does not 
consider that the change in the ferment content is sufficiently 
definite to admit of a diagnosis of the presence of disease. 

Trommsdorff also investigated the presence of ferments in 
cases of acute and chronic mastitis. He agrees that the alteration

H a 



too MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

in the ferment content cannot be regarded as a reliable test of 
the presence of disease. 

Gratz and Maray, investigating conditions of mastitis in relation 
to the ferment content, showed that the reductase content, as 
measured by the time required for reduction of the F.M.B. solution, 
was very variable, and could not be regarded as a reliable aid in 
the diagnosis of mastitis. The time of the reaction was frequently 
prolonged with colostral milk. 

Ullmann found that the catalase content was usually raised 
in conditions of mastitis, but he pointed out that the alteration 
in content appeared to depend rather more upon the alteration in 
the nature of the secretion than on the actual clinical condition 
of the udder. The peroxidase content of milk in mastitis he found 
to be variable. Sometimes an increase was obtained, sometimes 
a decrease, and evidence of the presence of peroxidase might even 
be absent. Reduction of the F.M.B. solution might also be absent, 
while the amount of diastase present was variable. Accompanying 
these changes there was usually a rise in the alkalinity of the milk. 

Montius investigated the milk of cows suffering from foot 
and mouth disease. He found that unless the udder itself was 
affected a rise of ferment content was not present. Should, 
however, an increase in catalase be obtained, this was probably 
indicative of commencing disease of the udder, and was, he con- 
sidered, secondary to the primary disease. Stetter also found a 
rise in ferment content in diseased conditions of the udder. 

These facts, although somewhat indefinite, denote that in 
conditions where the gland tissue is affected, so as to admit of 
increased exudation from the blood to the lumen of the gland 
tubules even in a small degree, there will be a tendency for 
a rise in the content of catalase and possibly of other ferments 
which are present in the blood.

SUMMARY^OF CHAPTER VI 

ON THE SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK (continued) 

B. THE SUBSTANCES CONCERNED IN THE PRODUCTION 
OF IMMUNITY 

THE subject-matter of this chapter forms the basis of one of the 
most interesting, but at the same time one of the most difficult, 
phases in the hygienic aspect of the milk question. 

The transference of immunity from one generation to another 
has been the subject of investigation for a number of years, in fact 
ever since the problem of immunity began to be studied. The 
first phase in the investigations was directed towards ascertaining, 
if possible, whether such immunity as might be found to be con- 
ferred was conferred before or after birth. In the present work 
the condition of the foetus as regards immunity is only indirectly 
of importance, since it evidently has no relation to milk. 

The early investigators studied the inheritance of immunity 
from three possible points of view : (i) Through the father, (2) 
through the mother before birth, and (3) through suckling. As a 
result of these investigations it appears that no immunity is conferred 
by the father, while there is some divergence of opinion in regard 
to the possible conferring of immunity through the mother before 
birth, the bulk of the evidence being definitely against this occur- 
rence. The third line of investigation is the one with which this 
present work is chiefly concerned. 

The production of immunity in any organism is not a simple 
matter, but involves many complex considerations. Everyone is 
aware that certain diseases once contracted by an individual confer 
immunity from further attacks. Moreover, the difference in the 
tendency to contract diseases between different individuals is a 
matter of common knowledge. Some species of animals are more 
liable to certain diseases than are other species, while others again 
are entirely immune from diseases to which further varieties of 
animals fall a ready prey. 

A very great amount of work has been carried out in order to 
discover what mechanisms are at work in the animal organism, which 
account for these remarkable phenomena. Although these in- 

108 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 109 

vestigations have provided us with a considerable amount of 
information of great interest, and have enlarged our knowledge 
sufficiently to enable great advances to be made in the prevention 
of disease, there are still many points which await elucidation. 
Even where sufficient knowledge has been acquired to be of immense 
benefit to the community, the precise reactions which are necessary 
in the body before an individual can be put in a position to resist 
disease, are to a large extent obscure. 

In order that immunity may be conferred by the mother 
upon her offspring, she must herself possess immunity to the 
particular disease or organism which may be under considera- 
tion. It has been found more convenient by the majority of 
investigators who were engaged upon the study of inheritance of 
immunity, to render the mother immune to certain well-known 
diseases and to study subsequently in the offspring any transference 
of immunity to this disease. Immunity to a disease thus arti- 
ficially imposed upon the mother is known as acquired immunity. 
E.g. vaccination imparts an acquired immunity to smallpox. A 
person who has once suffered from scarlet fever and other diseases 
does not usually contract the disease a second time. 

Where an individual or a species possesses immunity to any 
particular disease without any manipulation being required, such 
immunity is spoken of as natural immunity. 1 

In addition to these two types of immunity there is yet a third 
type, known as passive immunity. This form is transitory, and 
the mechanism employed for its production is different from that 
of either acquired or natural immunity. 2 It will be shown later 
that the form of immunity which may be acquired by suckling when 
the mother herself possesses either natural or acquired immunity, 
is passive immunity. 

One of the methods employed by the animal organism for 
protecting itself against the invasion of foreign substances has 
already been referred to in Chap. Ill, where it was shown that the 
injection of a foreign protein produces a reaction of the body tend- 
ing to throw out of solution the invading substance. Analogous 
methods are employed by the body to deal with invading micro- 
organisms. Substances are produced which are capable of disinte- 
grating the bacteria, or which may act by first of all throwing the 
bacteria into clumps, that is by agglutinating them, and subse- 

1 For example, pigeons enjoy a practical immunity to the bacillus ol 
human tuberculosis, and rats show a high resistance to anthrax. 

* Passive immunity is conveyed when an antitoxin found in the body 
of one animal in response to a stimulus (acquired immunity) is injected into 
the body of another, for the purpose of neutralising a toxin already present, 
or to act as a temporary defence against a possible invasion of micro-organisms 
producing the toxin. Thus where a wound has become infected with material 
containing the organism of tetanus, an injection of tetanus antitoxin 
neutralises the toxins formed and gives the body time to develop its own 
protective mechanism.

quently killing them. Similar methods are employed by the 
body to defend itself against the presence of red corpuscles belonging 
to another animal when these are injected. This last method 
forms a convenient one for investigating many of the problems 
connected with immunity. The reaction of the body to these 
different materials is a complex one, more than one substance 
being involved in the extermination of the invading bacteria or 
red corpuscles, but to consider this more fully would be beyond 
the scope of the present work. Each animal organism possesses 
a certain degree of immunity to the invasion of other substances, 
differing considerably in different species, and also slightly between 
different members of the same species. 

The numerous experiments which have been carried out upon 
milk show that whatever ' protective ' substances may be present 
in the blood of the mother will pass out in the milk. 

During the colostral period there is a higher content of these 
substances than in later milk. In view of the connection of these 
properties with protein, this fact is in accordance with the high 
protein and antigen content of colostrum compared with that of 
later milk. 1 

Famulener found that the immune substances in colostrum were 
actually present in higher amount than in the blood. 

After the colostral period is passed the amount of the protective 
substances found in the milk is generally greatly reduced. Where, 
however, the immunity in the mother is of the passive variety, 
induced by the injection of an antitoxin, the amount present in the 
milk will depend upon the amount in the blood. 

No precise ratio has been determined between the content of 
these substances in the blood and in the milk, but it has been 
found to vary in strength in the milk between -n> to ^ that of the 
blood. 

There seems no doubt that the absorption of unchanged protein 
must take place from the alimentary canal of the infant in the 
early days of life. The properties connected with the production 
of all forms of immunity are known to be attached to the proteins 
and to be almost certainly destroyed by digestion. The blood 
of the young of a mother who has been immunised, does not at 
birth contain the immune substances possessed by its mother. 
These, however, are found after suckling has been established, 
although it has been shown that only a portion of the total amount 
present in the milk has been absorbed by the young animal as a 
result of suckling. 

If antitoxin be used, the amount present in the milk can be 
estimated. The corresponding amount can easily be added to 
the milk of an unimmunised mother and fed to a control animal, 
but in this case it is found that the amount absorbed is less than 

* t Cp. Chap. III. 



SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES' OF MILK in 

when the antitoxin has been received through the mother. This 
is attributed to the nature of the protein to which the antitoxin 
is attached. When it is added directly to the milk it will probably 
be attached to a protein which is ' foreign ' to the suckling animal 
under investigation. It appears that although some absorption 
of ' foreign ' protein does occur, it is absorbed in smaller amount 
than the ' native ' protein of the mother's milk. 

Direct absorption of protein does not occur later than the first 
few days after birth, except in some cases where the condition of 
the alimentary canal is abnormal. This may be the case in general 
disturbances, and can also be induced artificially. 

Many of the investigations upon the transference of immunity 
by means of suckling have been carried out with antitoxin, with 
the results which have just been mentioned. Experiments have 
also been carried out in order to determine the occurrence in milk 
of those bodies normally present in the blood of adult animals, 
which are concerned with the production of immunity. 

The factors concerned in haemolysis have been found to be 
present in colostrum. One of these (amboceptor) is only found 
in the first two to three days, the other (complement) persists for 
a few days longer. Some authors have found evidence of the 
presence of this factor in later milk. There is a good deal of 
evidence tending to show that the reaction used to demonstrate the 
presence of complement depends upon other factors. 

There has been a good deal of discussion upon the power of 
milk to destroy bacteria. Some observers have even regarded it 
as a sufficient protection against infection through milk. These 
claims can in no way be substantiated as a result of investigations 
and as further evidenced by the occurrence of epidemics, which 
have been traced indubitably to milk. A decrease in the number 
of colonies of bacteria found, on plating out milk, has undoubtedly 
been shown to occur after milking. After a few hours, however, 
this phenomenon is not exhibited, and even when it has occurred 
in the early hours the number of colonies at the end of twenty- 
eight hours does not suggest any permanent decrease in the number 
of bacteria. It appears probable that the diminution in colonies 
is due to the agglutination or clumping together of several bacteria, 
which, as the agglutinating power wears off, again separate and 
begin to multiply vigorously. 

Our knowledge upon the transference of immunity by suckling 
demonstrates the immense value to the young of the colostrum 
of its mother, and emphasises the need for breast-feeding.

THE SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK (continued) 

B. THE SUBSTANCES CONCERNED IN THE PRODUCTION 
OF IMMUNITY 

On the Presence of Substances concerned in Haemolysis. A 
good deal of work has been carried out in order to determine 
whether either of the haemolytic factors complement or amboceptor 
or both were normally present in milk. For the investigation 
of this matter it is necessary to use an appropriate system. 

The earliest investigations, which were carried out by Pfaundler 
and Moro (i), showed evidence of the presence of complement 
in cows' milk. The system used by these observers consisted of 
guinea-pigs' corpuscles + inactive ox serum, 
+ raw milk. 

This system is known to be a suitable one on the supposition that 
the complement contained in milk will be identical with that 
present in ox blood. 

Shortly afterwards Kopf, working in Schlossmann's laboratory 
under Bauer, and using the same system, was unable to detect 
the presence of complement in ordinary milk, although he obtained 
evidence of its presence in colostrum. 

Sassenhagen and Bauer showed, further, that complement is 
easily demonstrable in milk of a cow suffering from mastitis, and 
they believed that this test formed a useful method of diagnosing 
the presence of mastitis before clinical observation was able to 
detect the presence of this trouble. 

Investigations carried out by myself in 1908 led me to believe 
that complement was normally present in cows' milk. The con- 
dition of the cows from which the samples of milk used by me 
were obtained was, however, not known, and it is not unlikely 
that had this information been forthcoming the presence of the 
complement found by me might have been explained on lines 
in agreement with the work of other authors. 

Sassenhagen in 1910 showed that complement is regularly 
present in colostrum, and that it disappears from the milk with 
the disappearance of the colostral characteristics. The evidence 
above obtained by Sassenhagen and by Sassenhagen and Bauer 
was confirmed in 1911 by Bernard Schmidt, who, using the method of 
the above authors, found complement to be present in colostrum and 
also in milk from a cow suffering from mastitis. He was unable to 
obtain evidence of the presence of complement in ordinary milk with 
the usual haemolytic system, but traces could sometimes be shown 
to be present, when an immune serum of high potentiality was used. 



SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES' OF MILK 113 

Lenzen also found complement constantly present in the milk 
of cows suffering from mastitis. More recently evidence has been 
obtained by Moser and by Kobele, who showed also that the 
complement content is the same throughout the milking, there 
being no difference between the early milk and the strippings. 

Human Milk. The investigations on the presence of com- 
plement in human milk are not conclusive, and it does not appear 
that human colostrum has been subjected to any investigation 
from this point of view. 

Cattaneo (1905) believed that he had obtained evidence of 
complement in human milk, but Frey pointed out later that 
Cattaneo's results were probably due to a technical flaw. 

Other observers, notably Pfaundler and Moro (2), Bauer (2), 
Noeggerath and Kolff, have investigated the presence of comple- 
ment in human milk, using a similar system to that used when 
dealing with cows' milk. 

Moro and Pfaundler (2) believed that there was an inhibitory effect 
preventing haemolysis, due to some alteration of the red corpuscles. 
Bauer (2) agreed as to the inhibitory effect, but believed that it 
was not due to the cause assigned by these authors. Moro and 
Pfaundler, and Noeggerath and Kolff, although they failed to detect 
the presence of complement in human milk, were able to obtain traces 
of haemolysis in some cases, when using a strong immune serum. 

The presence of amboceptor has not been demonstrated in 
ordinary milk, either in cows' milk or in human milk, but Kobele 
found amboceptor was present somewhat inconstantly in colostrum 
up to the second or third day, but it did not persist as long as 
complement, which was present up to about the fifth day. 

In addition to the work above described upon the presence of 
complement in human and cows' milk, investigations have been 
carried out which suggest that the haemolytic action which has 
been obtained by certain authors, is possibly not due to the presence 
of haemolytic factors as such. Thus, there is some evidence to 
show that milk which gives no indication of the presence of 
complement immediately after being withdrawn from the gland 
does show evidence of the presence of this substance when the milk 
is kept in the cold. 1 

Hewlett and Revis (i, 2) carried out some experiments upon the 
presence of complement in the milk from separate cows and in 
mixed milk. They found it more frequently present in the early 
and later stages of lactation, or in a condition of mastitis, than in 
ordinary milk. When present, the reaction does not occur with 
all haemolytic systems, even though these systems are of consider- 
able sensitiveness, and they suggest that the reaction is not that 
of a true complement. These authors also find that milk exercises 
a stimulating effect upon haemolytic action, the extent of which 

1 Cp. Ellen beck and Bauer (3). 



H 4 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

depends upon the amount of the amboceptor which is added to 
form part of the haemolytic system. They consider that this may 
account for some of the divergent results obtained by different 
investigators. 

Schmidt found that the complement present in serum is inacti- 
vated by shaking, but that reactivation can be obtained by various 
methods. 

The evidence so far obtained shows that complement and 
sometimes amboceptor are present in the colostrum of cows, and 
that complement tends to reappear towards the end of lactation 
or in conditions of mastitis. In ordinary milk, if present at all, 
it is present in such small quantities that it can only occasionally 
be detected by using a very sensitive system. 

It may be recalled here that in considering the presence of lipase 
in milk it was shown by Davidsohn, that the surface tension was 
reduced on standing in the cold, which effect he believed was 
attributable to the action of lipase. It is possible that this 
phenomenon is also closely connected with the haemolysis, of which 
evidence is found when milk is allowed to stand in the cold. The 
occurrence of haemolysis is known to be connected with surface 
tension, and it is therefore very probable that there is a con- 
nection between any haemolytic activity which is shown by milk 
after it has been drawn from the gland, and the presence of lipase. 
In any case there seems no doubt that such haemolytic action as 
ma}' be found, must be due to the nitration through from the blood 
of the substance concerned. Colostrum partakes more of the 
nature of serum than does later milk, while towards the end of lacta- 
tion milk assumes a different physical appearance and may even 
show certain of the characteristics of serum. This may also occur 
in mastitis, but will depend upon the degree of inflammation which 
is present. 

On the Presence of Bactericidal and Agglutinating Substances. 
Numerous investigations have been carried out upon the 
bactericidal power of milk, and statements have been made based 
upon what appears to be an exaggerated view of the bacteri- 
cidal action of milk. 

There would seem to be little doubt that there is some degree 
of bactericidal activity in milk, if this activity be judged merely 
by the decreasing number of colonies which grow when the milk 
is plated out. The power, however, does not last more than a few 
hours after the milk has been drawn, and it has been shown that, 
probably, the apparent bactericidal activity is in reality due to the 
agglutination of numbers of the bacteria, which thus reduces the 
numbers of colonies on the plates. 

Investigations upon the action of milk on cholera bacilli have 
been carried out by a number of authors. 1 The object of certain 

1 See Wolffhugel and Riedel, Kitasato, Heim, Uffelmann, Friedreich, 
Basenau, Weigmann, Hesse, and Fokker. 



SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES' OF MILK 115 

of these investigations was to show that milk which was infected 
by the cholera organism might safely be drunk, because the bacteri- 
cidal power of milk would be sufficient to destroy the organism. 
The investigations as a whole appear to show that the organism 
died only as soon as the milk became sour. 

A great number of organisms grow very readily in milk, although 
there is some evidence to show that certain organisms survive at 
the expense of other strains which die out fairly rapidly in the 
milk. 1 

Conn and Stocking showed that during the first few hours 
after milking there was an apparent decrease in the total number 
of bacteria which was most rapid during the first three hours. This 
decrease in total numbers was accompanied by a rapid increase 
in the number of acid-forming bacteria, which not only increased 
absolutely, but also in proportion to the total organisms present. 
The following table gives some idea of the results obtained by these 
workers :

Many observers have failed to obtain evidence of any bactericidal 
power of milk. 2 Klimmer, Sommerfeld, and Kolle used cultures of 
B. Coli or B. Typhosus for their investigations. Cozzolino found 
some evidence of inhibition of bacterial growth both with human 
and cows' milk. 

Koning investigated the numbers of bacteria present in the 
same sample of milk both directly after milking, and at later stages. 
He obtained evidence of an initial decrease in the number of bacteria, 
which was most marked in milk collected as far as possible free 
from bacterial contamination, being less marked in dirty milk. 
He found the optimum temperature to be 37 C. The decrease 
in the number of bacteria was not shown in milk which had been 
previously boiled, and persisted in raw milk for a longer period if 
the milk was kept cool. He believed that milk contained sub- 
stances inhibitory to the growth of bacteria, which were probably 
derived from the blood.

MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



Rullmann and Trommsdorff agreed with Koning, and showed 
that the inhibitory effect upon ordinary bacterial flora persisted 
almost throughout the first day even at room temperature. The 
inhibitory effect was increased in mastitis. 

The majority of observers who have compared the rate of growth 
of bacteria in raw and boiled milk believe that the inhibitory effect 
is destroyed by boiling, and that bacteria grow more readily in 
milk which has been previously boiled than they do in raw milk. 1 

Myer Coplans showed that the inhibition was exhibited for 
six hours after milking, at 20 C. , partial inhibition persisting for 
some hours longer. If the milk was kept at blood heat, the 
inhibition only lasted for one hour, partial inhibition lasting for 
from two to six hours after milking. At o C. the inhibition persisted 
for twenty-four hours. 

Rosenau and McCoy (1908) showed (see table below) that the 
apparent bactericidal effect, as shown by a decrease in the number 
of colonies obtained on plating out, which occurred in fresh milk 
was probably due to agglutination of the bacteria, since it could 
be shown to be entirely absent if the agglutinated masses of 
bacteria were broken up before the milk was plated out.

The decrease occurred only in the first six to eight hours after 
milking, and was not found in boiled milk or in milk heated to 
80 C. It was not effected by freezing, but was hindered by dilution. 
The action was specific, since it was not the same for different 
species of bacteria, nor was it the same in different milks, or 
even in different samples from the same animal. They also showed 

1 Cp. St. John and Pennington, Moro (3), Myer Coplans. 



SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF MILK 117 

that the agglutinating and therefore the inhibitory effect could 
be apparently restored by adding a drop of typhoid agglutinating 
serum, as shown in the table on the previous page. 

The breaking up of the clumps was accomplished by drawing 
the milk up and down a fine pipette pressed against the bottom of 
the vessel. 

The milk was almost germ-free, and the samples after inoculation 
were kept at 37 C. 

!:. The effect of agglutination was also shown by Bub, working 
on colostrum. Bub obtained evidence of some inhibition upon 
the ordinary flora of milk at a temperature of from i5-i8 C., 
the action being less marked at 37 C. If the milk was well shaken 
before plating for the bacterial count, no inhibition was detected, 
although the count was higher in boiled milk than in raw. The 
organisms used were B. Coli, B. Paratyphosus and B. Pyocyaneus.

Other observations which have been carried out by Much, 
Bartelli, Gutseit and Kleinschmidt are for the most part on similar 
lines to those already considered and confirmatory of the results 
already obtained. 

Bartelli believed that the inhibition was due to the gradual 
development of acidity in the milk owing to the growth of the lactic 
acid organisms. If the milk was kept cool during the period of 
inhibition, then the acidity did not rise and no inhibition occurred. 

Sassenhagen carried out a number of experiments with the 
colostrum and later milk of both cows and goats. He considers 
that the results show bactericidal power in the milk, which is 
more marked in colostrum than in later milk. The table 
on p. 118 has been compiled from the results given by Sassen- 
hagen, but the figures hardly bear out the claims for any marked 
power for destroying bacteria. 

In some experiments, drops of a culture of B. Coli were added. 
The milk was in all cases collected with aseptic precautions, and 
in some of the work the milk was heated to inactivate the comple- 
ment (which he showed was present in colostrum) in order to 
eliminate the bactericidal effect. The figures obtained at four 
hours after milking in the experiments with colostrum justify to

some extent the claims as to bactericidal power, but the effect 
appears to have completely worn off at a later stage, when all 
the samples to which B. Coli had been added gave a bacterial count 
too high to estimate. 

The results could readily be interpreted as due to the 
agglutinating power which is known to be present in fresh milk 
and which has already been considered. 

The probability that it is the agglutination of the bacteria 
which is one of the prime factors in producing the decrease in 
bacteria during the early hours after milking, receives confirmatory 
evidence from the investigations of those who have studied the 
presence of agglutinins in milk. Thus Kraus (1901) found that 
artificial agglutinins, if present in the blood, were passed out into 
the milk. Langer showed that the agglutinating power of colos- 
trum is greater than that of the later milk, and von Zubrzycki 
and Wolfsgruber found that haemagglutinins were present in 
colostrum, but that only traces could be detected later, the re- 
action being most marked in the first two or three days. These 
authors showed that the agglutinins were present for a longer 
period in primiparous women than in multiparous. 

Tunnicliffe (1912) showed that the opsonic power of milk for 
streptococci, staphylococci, and tubercle was greater in colostrum 
than in later milk. The streptococcus phagocytic index for serum, 
in one woman whose milk was investigated, was 0-8 in the serum 
and O'i8 in the colostrum. 

The work upon the presence of bactericidal substances or 
agglutinins in human milk and in colostrum is neither very extensive 
nor are the results very convincing. Clinical evidence has been 
obtained of the presence of agglutinins in the milk of women 
suffering from typhoid fever. For further details of work compare 
Honigmann, Moro (2, 4, 7), Cozzolino, Klimmer, Schenk, Noeggerath 
and Kolff, Kleinschmidt. 

Summarising the question of bactericidal power possessed 
by raw milk, it appears that there is some evidence of decrease 
in the number of bacteria during the first few hours after milking, 
as shown by the methods of plating out. It is not unlikely, 
however, that this is apparent rather than real, and is due to the 
agglutination of the bacteria by agglutinins present in the milk. 
The inhibitory power which is present depends for its persistence 
upon the temperature at which the milk is kept, but in ordinary 
circumstances would not appear to last for more than twelve 
hours after the milk has been drawn. As milk is seldom delivered 
to the customer within twelve hours after milking, the bactericidal 
power of milk from the point of view of infant hygiene may be 
neglected. 

The presence in ordinary milk of factors concerned in haemolysis 
is probably in itself a matter of comparatively little importance. 
The same is almost certainly true of the bactericidal or agglutinating 



120 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

effect. The real interest of their presence lies in the insight 
thus obtained into the mode of action of the mammary gland. 
There can be no doubt that these substances are derived from the 
blood stream and pass out into the milk. 

Greater amounts of these substances are present in colostrum, 
and the fact that the haemolytic factors are found only during the 
colostral period, or at such other periods when the gland function 
is in some degree abnormal, adds weight to this point. 

The Production of Passive Immunity by Suckling. The passage 
of substances concerned in the production of immunity from the 
blood to the milk, has been widely studied. For this purpose it 
has been found easier to immunise the mother, or inject a known 
antitoxin, whose presence both in the blood and in the milk 
could be readily detected. In some cases the relative strength 
of the antitoxin in the blood and in the milk was examined, and 
also the effect on the milk of raising the antitoxin content of 
the blood. 

The results obtained have shown conclusively that whatever 
properties are possessed by the blood of the mother are possessed 
also by the milk, although to a lesser degree. These properties 
are known to be attached to the proteins, and there is a good deal 
of evidence to show that they are destroyed in the alimentary 
canal when the protein undergoes digestion. 1 

Hence, when the digestive functions of the child are established 
after birth, the immune properties present in the milk are destroyed, 
and they then possess only the actual food-value of the protein 
to which they are attached. 

The possibility of the absorption of protein without digestion 
in the early days of life has been mentioned in Chapter III, where 
the identity of the whey-proteins with those of the blood was 
shown. If this occurs, it would be likely that any immune properties 
possessed by the mother's blood would be absorbed by the infant 
directly, until such time as the digestive functions have sufficiently 
developed to destroy the protein-complex. 

Numerous experiments have been conducted upon these lines, 
and all show that the above proposition holds good. 

The early experiments were carried out by workers who were 
investigating the transmission of immunity from the parent to 
the offspring. Ehrlich found that when a mother was rendered 
immune to abrin, ricin, robin or tetanus, this immunity was trans- 
ferred to her young by means of suckling. The immunity thus 
conferred lasted for about a month. By the third month of life 
it was much reduced, and shortly afterwards it disappeared entirely. 
The animals used by him were mice. 

Hamburger (2), working on somewhat similar lines, showed 
definitely that this immunity was transferred by suckling. He

Bauer. 



SO-CALLED 'BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES' OF MILK 121 

also used mice which were immune to ricin. After the birth of 
the young, one of the mothers which had been immunised was 
allowed to suckle young mice from a normal mother, and another 
immunised mother was allowed to suckle her own young. 
Immunity to ricin was found in the young of both series and in 
an approximately equal degree, thus showing that the immunity 
had been transferred by suckling. 

Experiments on these lines demonstrate the fundamental 
fact of the transference of immune properties from the mother 
to the young animal by means of the milk. This fact carries 
with it the necessity for the absorption of the immune properties 
by the young animal, and as has already been pointed out, it is 
necessary for such absorption to be carried out without prior 
digestion of the protein substances to which the immune properties 
are attached. 

Two considerations arise consequent upon this fact : (i) The 
length of time for which such absorption can last after birth, and 
(2) the amount of immune substances thus absorbed. This second 
consideration will evidently depend upon the amount of such immune 
substance present in the milk. The majority of the observations 
upon these matters have been carried out with antitoxins of one 
kind or another. The length of time after birth during which 
absorption can take place directly, varies in different animals, but 
would not appear to be longer than a few days under normal 
circumstances. 

Romer (i) worked with diphtheria antitoxin, which he injected 
into a pregnant mare shortly before parturition. After parturition 
antitoxin could be detected in the milk in a strength of about 
-j^ of that in the mother's blood. At the time of birth no anti- 
toxin could be detected in the blood of the foal, but after birth it 
appeared, and the amount continued to rise until about the twelfth 
day, after which the content of antitoxin in the foal's blood 
gradually sank. Later injections of antitoxin into the mother 
produced a corresponding rise in the antitoxin content of the milk, 
but did not prevent the continued fall of antitoxin content in the 
foal's blood. Evidently this experiment implies that absorption 
of antitoxin took place during the first few days after birth, but 
that although there may be a higher antitoxin content in the milk 
at a later date, no such absorption occurs. 

Confirmatory results were also obtained by Hamburger (2) , who 
found that if a kid twelve days old was fed by a mother who had 
been injected with tetanus antitoxin very little absorption took 
place. Working with Sperk and using the precipitin method for 
the detection of protein, Hamburger failed to obtain evidence of 
absorption of protein in a calf of three days old, or in infants of from 
five weeks to thirteen weeks old, to whom horse serum was given. 
Evidently the children were above the age at which such absorption 
would be likely to occur, and the work is somewhat complicated 



122 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

by the use of a ' foreign ' protein. The absorption of ' foreign ' 
protein by animals fed on this material within a few days after 
birth is considered later. Similar results involving certain points 
which will be considered immediately, were also obtained by Much 
and Romer and by Much and Happich. 

Famulener immunised pregnant goats to the red corpuscles 
of the sheep, and showed that a passive immunity to sheep's 
corpuscles was obtained by suckling. He also demonstrated the 
presence of the immune substances in the colostrum, and found 
that the content of these bodies was sometimes actually higher in 
colostrum than in the blood of the mother. If the immunisation 
of the mother was only commenced after parturition l no immunity 
was conferred by suckling, although the immune substances could 
be detected in the milk, but in smaller amounts than were found 
in the colostrum in the first experiments. These experiments 
also show that absorption takes place only in the early days 
after birth. 

The amount of absorption which occurs as a result of suckling 
is not an entirely simple matter. The antitoxin which is injected 
into the mother is usually derived from an animal of a different 
species. For example, tetanus antitoxin may be derived from the 
horse and injected into the mother in the form of horse serum. 
This horse serum, when injected into the mother, will evidently enter 
the blood stream, and, except in the case of a mare, the question 
arises whether it passes out in the milk attached to the protein 
of the horse serum or not. The results so far obtained seem to show 
that there is probably a transference of the immune properties from 
the horse serum, which formed the vehicle for the supply of anti- 
toxin in the mother's blood, to the protein of the species which was 
injected. 

The amount absorbed by suckling appears to depend upon 
whether the immune properties are attached to the ' foreign ' 
protein or to the protein of the same species. This has been 
demonstrated by the following experiment. 

Much and Romer injected tetanus antitoxin derived from a 
horse, into a cow, before parturition. The calf was fed from birth 
with the milk of its mother, the amount of antitoxin in the milk 
being estimated, as also the amount in the calf's serum. It was 
found that about -^ of the amount of antitoxin present in the 
milk was absorbed by the calf. If, instead of allowing the calf to 
suckle from an immunised mother, the same amount of antitoxin 
which had been found to be present in the milk of the immunised 
mother was mixed with the milk in the form of horse-antitoxin 
and fed to the calf, the absorption which occurred amounted only 
to ^-^ (or ten times as little as in the former case) of the amount 



1 Several days are required for the production of immunity in the mother, 
so that immune substances would not appear in the milk until some days 
after the commencement of immunisation. 



SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 123 

present in the milk. They found further that if the calf was allowed 
to suckle an immunised mother, beginning at the fifth day after 
birth, only about ^(nnr f the total amount of antitoxin present in 
the milk was absorbed. 

Almost identical results were obtained by Much and Happich 
in a case of a woman who had received tetanus antitoxin on the 
day before, and four days after, the confinement. The blood of the 
infant born the day after the first injection contained no antitoxin. 
The amount of antitoxin present in the milk was estimated and 
the amount which subsequently appeared in the infant's blood. 
It was found that in the first four days after birth the child had 
absorbed by suckling about ^ of the total amount of antitoxin 
which was present in the milk. Between the fourth and 
eighth day only ^ of the total antitoxin present was absorbed. 
Using the milk from a normal woman, the observers added an 
amount of antitoxin obtained from a horse which corresponded 
to the amount present in the former experiment. In this case 
they found that about -fa was absorbed within the first six days 
after birth and about TWV was absorbed between the fourth and 
the eighth days after birth. In this work experiments were carried 
out to determine whether there was any evidence of horse protein 
in the milk of the mother, that is to say, whether the antitoxin 
passed out in the milk attached to the proteins of the horse serum, 
or had been transferred to the proteins of the mother. No evidence 
of the presence of horse serum in the milk could be obtained 
either by the precipitin reaction or by the method of complement 
deviation. 

These results were confirmed by further similar experiments 
upon rabbits. 

Hamburger (i) did not, however, agree with the interpretation 
of Much and his collaborators. He injected lactating rabbits with 
tetanus antitoxin obtained from the horse, and stated that horse 
antitoxin could be demonstrated in milk by the ordinary precipitin 
test. Also he stated that evidence of the ' foreign ' protein which 
must have been absorbed from the milk by suckling, could be ob- 
tained in the blood of the young animal, by injecting the blood into 
mice and ascertaining the presence of an antigen. The amount 
of ' foreign ' protein present in the blood of the young was only 
about -ffo of that found in the milk. 

Further experiments have been carried out by Romer (i) and 
Romer and Sames (i) (1909) which confirmed the results previously 
obtained by these investigators. It would not appear necessary 
to consider these in any further detail, since the results were similar 
to those previously considered. 

It seems evident that ' foreign ' protein can be absorbed by the 
suckling animal in the early days of life, but that the absorption 
proceeds on a very much smaller scale than in the case of a native 
protein. Thus Ganghofner and Langer, using the precipitin method, 



124 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

found that egg-white was absorbed by young animals during the 
first few days of life : 

In puppies up to the sixth day, 
In kittens up to the eighth day, 
In rabbits up to the seventh day, 

and was already negative in goats at the eighth day. They 
believed that a longer period must be allowed for infants. The 
investigation, however, of Salge (i) tends to show that the direct 
absorption of protein in infants ceases after about four days. 
The work also of Langer, Bauer (i), Vaillard, Kraus and 
Bauereisen should also be compared for the question of absorption 
in the early days of life. 

On the Possible Direct Absorption of Protein after the Early 
Days of Life. A considerable amount of work has been carried 
out by different observers with a view to ascertaining under what 
conditions protein could be absorbed directly from the alimentary 
canal in later life. Some of the work has been undertaken in the 
endeavour to administer diphtheria by means of the alimentary 
canal instead of by injection. 1 There is evidence that a protein 
can be absorbed directly in abnormal conditions of the alimentary 
canal. Thus Ganghofner and Langer and also Uhlenhuth found 
that when very large amounts of proteins were given some degree 
of absorption took place. The same result was obtained by Mayer- 
hofer and Pribram, who rendered the intestines somewhat abnormal 
before giving the protein, and also by Van Alstyne and Grant, 
using a Thierry- Vella fistula. 

Investigations have also been carried out upon the absorption 
of ' foreign ' protein by children who were in an unsatisfactory state 
of health. Moro (5, 6) examined the blood of twenty-three cases of 
children who were very ill, or who had just died, for the presence of 
foreign protein, by means of the precipitin method. He found a 
positive reaction in three cases. Using the method of complement 
deviation in seven cases, he found four were positive. It is probable, 
if not certain, that the condition of the intestine in these cases was 
abnormal and had admitted of the passage of the protein. 

More recent investigations both by Lust and by Hahn are 
confirmatory of the above results, and show that it is only in 
comparatively few cases that absorption of ' foreign ' protein 
occurs unchanged. Hahn found that in only five cases out of 
twenty-three and in two of these the result was doubtful was 
any evidence of the absorption of antitoxin obtained b} 7 the ali- 
mentary canal, and this only in children who were very ill and 
where large doses had been given. 

Lust found that in a few cases where there was severe intestinal 
disturbance some absorption took place, egg-white being more

SO-CALLED ' BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ' OF MILK 125 

easily absorbed than ox serum. He found that even where the 
condition was such as to allow of the passage of a ' foreign ' protein, 
recovery was still possible. 

Some observers have believed that the ' foreign ' protein of 
cows' milk, of which a small portion is probably absorbed by the 
infant, was actually detrimental, but the evidence upon this point 
cannot be regarded as entirely conclusive. 1 

At birth the young animal appears to have no capacity for 
providing its own resistance to the invasion of foreign substances 
or organisms. This capacity develops gradually during the early 
months of life, apparently about the sixth month in breast-fed 
children, and about the fifty-third day in young rabbits.* Artifici- 
ally-fed children appear to develop this capacity rather earlier. 
A greater strain is thrown initially upon the organism, leading, 
when this initial strain has been overcome, to the rather earlier 
development of a protective mechanism. The strain on the 
artificially-fed child is referred to in Chap. X, where the generally 
lower weight of artificially-fed babies during the early weeks of 
life as compared with breast-fed ones, is shown. 

Investigations by Moro (i, 3) and Salge show that greater natural 
properties of immunity are possessed by the breast-fed child than 
by the artificially-fed one. This subject is beyond the scope of the 
present work, but further information can be obtained in the papers 
by Halban, Halban and Landsteiner, Bertarelli, and Gewin. 
There can be no doubt of the extreme value to the young animal 
of the colostrum of its species. It is stated that in some species 
the young do not survive if deprived of this form of nourishment, 
and there can be no doubt that the artificially-fed human infant, 
although it does not die, and may even show no outwardly detri- 
mental effects from early artificial feeding, leads a much more 
precarious existence than its fellow who has received its natural 
food after birth.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER VII 

ON THE CELLULAR CONTENT OF MILK 

THE presence of cells in milk has been known for many years. They 
form a normal constituent of the milk obtained from healthy cows 
under satisfactory conditions. It is a question whether the number 
of cells which are present may enable a determination to be made 
of the condition of the cow or of the cow's udder at the time of 
milking, i.e. whether healthy or not. If the enumeration of cells 
could be utilised for such a purpose, it would evidently be necessary 
to ascertain within what limits the number of cells found could be 
regarded as normal, and whether the boundary line denoting patho- 
logical conditions could be defined. Further, it would be necessary 
to ensure the use of an accurate method of estimation of the number 
of cells present. 

Several methods have been suggested and used for estimating 
the cellular content of milk. The most usual methods have been 
to take a small quantity of milk, place it in small tubes, and centri- 
fugalise for a definite period. The supernatant fluid is then drawn 
off and the sediment investigated. This may be done either by 
removing the whole of the sediment and making films of it, which 
is known as the ' smeared sediment ' method, or the supernatant 
fluid may be removed down to a certain point, the volume of 
sediment being noted. This volume of sediment is then stained 
and the cells counted in an ordinary blood-counting apparatus. 

Recently it has been stated that more accurate counts are 
obtained when the milk is not previously centrifugalised but when 
the counts are made direct from milk which has been thoroughly 
mixed. Objections have been raised to the centrifuging of milk 
on the ground that a large number of the cells are caught up with 
the cream, becoming entangled in the meshes of the fat globules. 
The cream being removed with the supernatant fluid after centri- 
fugalising, a large number of the cells are removed with it, and do 
not enter into the count subsequently made. This error is said 
to amount to about 12 per cent, of all the cells, but it is probable 
that considerable variations exist in the number of cells thus 
caught up and removed from the fluid used for the estimation. 

130 



THE CELLULAR CONTENT OF MILK 131 

It has also been shown by numerous observers that the cell 
count is greatly increased when the milk is raised before centri- 
fugalising, to a temperature of about 70 C. It is believed that this 
preliminary heating destroys some of the agglutinating properties 
known to occur in milk, and that in some way it modifies the fat 
globules, rendering them unable to entangle and carry up the cells. 

In relation to the fallacies apparently shown when milk is 
centrifugalised or is not heated before the estimations are made, 
it is contended that the percentage loss is probably approximately 
equal in all the samples examined. In considering the cellular 
content of milk from an individual cow, although the absolute 
content may not be accurately estimated, yet the differences will 
remain the same in all the estimations : thus any marked rise in 
cellular content would, it is believed, be readily noted although the 
absolute number might not be obtained. 

In view of the defects in the methods which have been employed, 
it seems probable that many of the recorded cell-counts in milk 
are not accurate. There seems, moreover, little doubt that the 
differences between the cellular content of the milk of individual 
healthy cows is greater than the inaccuracies which may reason- 
ably be attributed to the methods used. It would seem impossible 
to fix any figure as the normal cellular content of milk ; the varia- 
tions found are too great. 

The attention of most observers has been directed towards 
determining at what figure the cell count could be considered to 
be abnormally large, and whether such an abnormal count could 
be directly associated with diseased conditions of the cow or of 
the udder. It appears that no such direct association can be 
found, and that the cell count frequently fluctuates from day to 
day between figures which might be regarded as either normal or 
abnormal. No factors have been found to account for such change 
in many of the instances. 

If disease were present it is probable that a high cell count 
would be accompanied by other changes. It has been shown 
already, in dealing with the presence in milk of ferments and of 
immune substances, that the content of these rises appreciably 
in early inflammatory disease of the udder. Several observers 
claim to have established a connection between an increased cell 
content and the presence of an undue number of bacteria, chiefly 
streptococci, in milk. Observations connecting the ferment 
content and the immune substance content with that of strepto- 
cocci or other organisms, and also with the high cell content in the 
milk, do not appear to have been made. It would seem, however, 
that there is sufficient evidence of the connection between a high 
cell content and the presence of a large number of streptococci 
to render further examination advisable, if the cell count should 
reach a figure which may reasonably be regarded as abnormal. 

A method of estimating leucocytes or white blood corpuscles

132 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

in milk was formulated by Trommsdorff. In this method the 
cells were not counted, but the depth of the layer obtained after 
centrifuging was noted. It was believed that an increase in the 
depth of the layer over what was believed to show a normal cell 
content denoted disease of the udder. 

Later investigations as to the value of this method as the sole 
means of diagnosis tend rather to show that no one method of in- 
vestigation can satisfactorily establish the presence of disease of 
the udder as shown in the milk. A high cell content alone may not 
denote any pathological condition, but when associated either with 
many streptococci or with an increased ferment or immune-substance 
content of the milk, there is increased probability, amounting 
perhaps when well marked to a certainty, of the presence of udder 
trouble. The application of these methods will evidently provide 
useful information, only when applied to the milk obtained either 
from one cow or from a comparatively small number of cows. In 
mixed milk or in market milk, the milk from one unhealthy udder, 
even though when examined alone it should show a very high 
cell [content or a high content of the factors above considered, 
will pass undetected when mixed with a larger quantity of milk, 
since there will be much dilution of the excess substance or sub- 
stances. Even where suspicion has been shown to attach to three 
or four cows only, it has been necessary to obtain milk separately 
from the individual cows, and frequently also from the individual 
quarters of the udder, in order to locate the site of the disease. 

The work of Bauer, Sassenhagen, and others 1 shows that 
changes may occur in the milk before any evidence of inflamma- 
tory condition can be detected clinically in the udder. The udder 
trouble was sometimes only detected several days after changes 
had been found in the milk. Admitting for the moment that dis- 
covery of such changes in milk obtained from an apparently healthy 
udder denoted the onset of early mastitis, it is doubtful whether 
such a discovery affords a method of practical value in dealing with 
an ordinary milk supply. It is evidently impossible to estimate 
separately either the bacterial content or the ferment content or 
the cell content of the milk of each cow at sufficiently frequent inter- 
vals to be able to eliminate a cow suffering from early mastitis. 

The real value of such tests would appear to lie in the aid afforded 
in the detection of disease in a cow whose milk had probably been 
the source of disease in human beings, such disease having been 
traced to the milk from a special farm, and, by a process of 
elimination, to a particular cow. In such cases, however, it is 
probable that some evidence of a pathological condition would 
be obtained as a result of careful veterinary examination. The 
tests mentioned become extremely valuable as confirmatory 
evidence of early disease of the udder, and may lead to a more 

1 See pp. 99, 100, 112. 



THE CELLULAR CONTENT OF MILK 133 

minute clinical examination being made of a suspected cow than 
would perhaps otherwise have been the case. A veterinary surgeon, 
when called upon to examine a large herd of cows, would be assisted 
by having his attention drawn to one or more suspected cows, and 
would be able to devote more care to the examination of these 
animals than he would be able to bestow on all the animals in the 
herd. 

The nature of the cellular elements present in milk has been the 
subject of much investigation both by histologists and by sani- 
tarians. The histologist is concerned with the origin of the cells 
in relation to the function of the gland. He wishes to know whether 
the cells found in milk are derived from the gland itself or 
whether they come from the blood and lymph. If they come from 
the gland, the presence of a large number of cells in milk would 
denote a very high degree of activity on the part of the gland tissue. 
If, on the other hand, they come from the blood, it then becomes 
a matter of interest to know why a large number of cells from 
the blood should be present in milk, whether they have strayed 
into the lumen of the gland and been thrown out in the process of 
secretion, whether they can be regarded as denoting an abnormal 
condition, or whether they should be regarded as providing 
nutriment for the suckling animal. 

The sanitarian is mainly concerned to determine whether the 
cells present in the milk are healthy or not. The origin of the 
cells is important to him, because if they should be shown to be 
derived from the blood, when they are present in large quantities, 
it might be supposed that they were of the nature of pus cells, that 
is, that they were dead leucocytes which had been killed in the 
attempt to resist bacterial infection in the gland. 

It must be admitted that at the present time opinions are not 
agreed upon this question. There is no means of distinguishing 
satisfactorily between dead and living leucocytes. Moreover, the 
cells of the mammary gland, of which a number undoubtedly 
would occur in milk, resemble very closely certain varieties of 
leucocytes. It is impossible here to consider at any length the 
structure of the different cells which are present in milk, but the 
main classes into which they can be placed may be mentioned. 
There would appear to be general agreement as to the presence of 
three main classes of cells : (i) Large uninucleated cells, (2) multi- 
nucleated cells, (3) small uninucleated cells. These are present 
in different proportions in different samples of milk examined. 
Pictures of the cells in these three classes are shown in the plate 
facing p. 136. In addition a considerable number of other cells 
occur, but in small numbers. 

Great differences of opinion appear to arise round the second 
class of cells, namely, the multinucleated. Some observers 1

134 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

consider that they are the ordinary type of polymorphonuclear 
leucocytes which are found universally in the blood stream. These 
cells, as is well known, are the scavengers of the blood and destroy 
bacteria which gain access to the organism. Hewlett considers 
that they cannot be leucocytes because he has not obtained any 
evidence of amoeboid movement on examining these cells, and 
he has not noted any phagocytosis as shown by the presence of 
bacteria in the cells. Other observers report the presence of 
bacteria in the bodies of these cells, which leads them to the belief 
that the cells are derived from the blood stream and are the ordinary 
polymorphic variety of leucocytes. If these cells are the scavenging 
cells of the body, their number should rise in any pathological 
condition of the udder. 

The work upon the relative numbers of the different varieties 
of cells found in milk when there is a high cell count, and possibly 
some inflammatory condition, is rather fragmentary and not 
very conclusive. At the present time it does not seem possible to 
decide the origin of the cells, but it is not unlikely that the kind 
of cell may differ in the milk of different species. 



CHAPTER VII 

ON THE CELLULAR CONTENT OF MILK 

THE presence of cells in normal milk has long been known. Interest 
arises out of this fact mainly on two grounds. There is evidently 
a physiological side which is concerned with the origin of these 
cefis and their function, and another one relating to public 
health. It has been suggested that the number of cells present 
might give an indication of the condition of the gland, i.e. 
whether healthy or not. This implies the necessity for 
using a method whereby the number of cells can be accurately 
estimated. 

The two questions are difficult to separate completely. It 
is not proposed here to deal at any length with the nature of the 
cells found in milk, since to do so would involve a consideration of 
the physiology and histology of the gland, which must be regarded 
as somewhat outside the scope of the present work. Neither 
the origin nor the function of these cells has as yet been definitely 
determined. It is possible that precise information may never 
be arrived at, since it is not at all unlikely that the origin will 
differ somewhat in different conditions 

The Nature of the Cellular Elements present in Milk. 
The discussion which has arisen round the cellular elements of 
milk has been mainly concerned in endeavouring to decide 



THE CELLULAR CONTENT OF MILK 135 

whether the bulk of the cells are derived from the epithelium of 
the gland or whether they must be regarded as white corpuscles, 
which have exuded from the tissues and from the blood 
stream. 

Czerny (1890) investigated the colostrum corpuscles of human 
milk and believed that the cells were in reality leucocytes, whose 
function was to remove such fat globules as had not been passed 
out in the milk, and to transfer them from the mammary gland 
to the nearest lymph gland. He did not regard them as excretory 
material. Czerny injected milk into the dorsal lymph sac of a 
frog and found that the fat globules were taken up by the leucocytes 
and carried away. Further experiments carried out on women, 
and also on a cat and on a rabbit, strengthened his belief in the 
carrying power of these leucocytes. He believed that when the 
gland function becomes upset, leucocytes pass through in increas- 
ing amounts. He found in a cat investigated, that the lymph 
glands nearest to the mammary gland were full of the same type 
of leucocyte as those found in the milk, and, in fact, could not 
be distinguished microscopically from the colostrum corpuscles. 
Czerny appears to regard these cells as normal leucocytes, of the 
large uninuclear variety. 

Winkler divided the cells present in milk into several groups. 
He believed that the majority of them were derived from the 
epithelium of the gland. Such cells often appeared to be multi- 
nucleated, but were, he believed, not blood corpuscles. These 
views are also held by Hewlett, Villar and Revis, who examined 
the varieties of cells present in a large number of milk samples. 
These investigators divided the cells into the following classes: 
(i) Large uninucleated cells, (2) multinucleated cells, (3) small 
uninucleated cells these classes forming the main mass of cells 
present ; in addition they described small numbers of eosinophile 
cells, some larger cells with vacuolated protoplasm, and other 
cells whose characteristics were indeterminate. These authors 
regard the vacuolated cells, which were of large size, as ' probably 
fat -bearing ' cells. No phagocytosis was observed. No amoeboid 
movement in any of the cells was noticed. It seems possible that 
these vacuolated cells of Hewlett may correspond to the cells 
described by Czerny, although Hewlett does not himself make any 
statement upon this subject. See Plate I. facing next page. 

Berka examined cells in human milk, and considers that the 
cells are lymphocytes of the large uninuclear variety. He be- 
lieves that as these cells begin to disintegrate the nucleus takes 
on a polymorphic appearance, thus resembling the usual poly- 
morphic leucocyte. He states that these cells are amoeboid, and 
considers therefore that they are not of epithelial origin. More- 
over, in examining sections of the active gland, mitoses are 
not seen in the cells lying in the secretion which would, he 
thinks, be the case if the cells found in milk were derived mainly 



136 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

from the epithelium of the gland. He agrees with Czerny that 
these cells are capable of taking up fat globules which have not 
been excreted and of conveying them to the nearest lymph gland. 
He believes that in other animals the colostral cells are probably 
polymorphic leucocytes. 

Gratz and Maray considered that the cells from the milk of 
cows were mostly of the type of polymorphic leucocytes, though 
colostrum corpuscles, presumably derived from the gland epithelium, 
were also present. The number of polymorphic cells increased in 
conditions of mastitis. 

Thomas examined the cells present in milk and believed that 
they consisted of polymorphic leucocytes and of large mono- 
nuclear cells which had phagocytic powers. Granular cells 
were also present which resembled epithelial cells in their 
appearance. 

Without going further into the question of the origin of these 
cells, it maybe reasonably concluded that a proportion of the cells 
found in milk is likely to be derived from the gland tissue. All 
active tissues of a glandular character tend to throw off a certain 
number of cells as a result of their activity, these cells presumably 
being dead or dying when cast off. Further, it is only reasonable 
to suppose that a number of leucocytes will be present in normal 
milk. The mammary gland has a large blood supply, and it has 
already been shown that a comparatively free filtration of salts 
and other substances takes place from the blood vessels to the 
lumen of the gland. Moreover, a high degree of cellular activity, 
which must be a normal condition of the active gland throughout 
the whole period of lactation, suggests in itself that there will be 
present in the whole gland tissue considerable numbers of white 
corpuscles of various forms. 

Savage examined the cells in the milk from the several quarters 
of some cows which had one quarter affected by inflammatory 
conditions. The most prominent variety of cells seems to have 
been the large uninucleated type, although sometimes there 
appears to have been excess of the multinucleated cells. Savage 
calls these cells 'leucocytes,' i.e. he considers they are derived from 
the blood. Hewlett and his co-workers think that in cases of a high 
cell count, even where tnere may be some inflammation, there is 
an increase in the multinuclear cells, but they do not consider that 
such cells are ' pus ' cells in the usual meaning of the term. 

The increased number of cells found in colostrum does not 
afford any difficulty. It is known that before the gland function 
is actively developed in the production of milk, the lumen of the 
tubules is crowded with cells. These cells must evidently first be 
cleared out of the gland with the early colostrum secreted. 

Practically, the point at issue from the public health aspect is 
at what stage the number of cells found in the milk, and the variety 
of such cells, must be regarded as passing from the normal cell con-

tent to that attending the presence of inflammatory or other 
diseased condition of the gland. This at once leads to a considera- 
tion of the methods which have been employed for enumerating the 
total number of cells present in milk. 

On the Methods of Estimating the Cellular Content of Milk. 
It is evidently important that the method of estimating the cell 
content of milk should be accurate if deductions are to be drawn 
from the number of cells found. The difficulties met with are, 
however, considerable, and preliminary manipulations are necessary 
before the number of cells present can be estimated. 

Stokes (1897) was the first investigator to deal with a method 
of estimating the cells in milk. His method consisted in 
centrifuging 10 c.c. of milk for ten minutes in a tube. He then 
removed the fat and supernatant liquid and examined a loopful of 
the sediment spread over an area of I sq. cm. on a glass cover slip. 
The film thus made was stained with methylene blue and ex- 
amined with an oil immersion lens. The cells in ten fields were 
counted and the average count per field obtained. When the 
number of leucocytes exceeded ten per field, it was customary to 
regard the milk as containing an abnormal number of cells and as 
unfit for use. It is now generally admitted that this method of 
Stokes cannot be regarded as sufficiently accurate. 

Stewart (1905) introduced a modification of this method. 
He used I c.c. of milk in a small glass tube, of which the lower end 
was closed with a rubber plug. The tube was then centrifuged 
for ten minutes and the rubber plug carefully drawn out from the 
tube, the sediment upon it being smeared over an area of i sq. 
cm. on a cover slip. This was then stained and the number of 
cells found in ten fields counted. As a result of practice it was 
customary to regard the number as excessive when the count 
exceeded twenty-three cells per field. 

Doane and Buckley introduced another method. This con- 
sisted in taking 10 c.c. of milk in a glass tube which was marked 
off in cubic centimetres. After centrifuging for ten minutes, the 
fat and supernatant liquid down to the i c.c. mark were removed. 
Stain was then applied to this remaining cubic centimetre and 
a drop of the mixture placed in a Thoma-Zeiss apparatus and 
the number of leucocytes per c.c. determined. Using this method, 
it was estimated that cells were present in excess when the figure for 
those counted showed a rate of more than 500,000 per c.c. of milk. 

A different form of test was introduced by Trommsdorff in 
1906. This method does not involve microscopical examination. 
Trommsdorff prepared small centrifuge tubes of which the lower 
end was drawn out into the form of a capillary tube and graduated. 
The graduations were arranged to show the volumes of sediment 
per litre. He usually took 5 c.c. of milk, or for a general test 10 
c.c. might be utilised. When, after centrifuging, more than one 
volume per litre of sediment was found, suspicion of excess of 



138 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

cells should, he considered, arise. If the volume reached two per 
litre, then mastitis was almost certainly present, as diagnosed by 
an increased number of cells present. Trommsdorff says that the 
dirt will be found at the bottom of the tube, and can be readily 
differentiated from the leucocytes lying upon it owing to the fact 
that these latter present a creamy colour in contradistinction to 
the greyish aspect of the actual dirt. The employment of this 
method suggested by Trommsdorff has led to a considerable degree 
of discussion. Evidently, if it can be regarded as reliable, it 
supplies a simple method which can be used by persons not suffi- 
ciently skilled to be capable of dealing with any microscopic test. 
It has been objected that the capillary tube may become blocked 
by dirt, and thus present an inaccurate reading. On the other 
hand, it is claimed that there is no difficulty in reading off the 
leucocyte content even should this occur. Trommsdorff himself 
regards his test as reliable only where milk from one cow is used, 
such milk including that obtained from all four quarters of the 
udder. The test is not claimed to be reliable for mixed milk, since 
here the total increase in cell content owing to disease in one or 
only a few of the cows from whom the milk is derived, is distributed 
through such a large quantity of milk as hardly to raise appreciably 
the total cell content. 

The value of this test has been fully discussed by Ruhm, who 
considers it useful for the discovery of mastitis or other disease 
of the udder in individual cows, but when suspicion is aroused in 
a sample of mixed milk further investigations of a microscopical 
character should be carried out. He does not consider that the test 
is sufficiently accurate for any judicial proceedings to be undertaken 
consequent upon the discovery of a high volume of leucocytes. 

Ernst appears to regard Trommsdorff 's test as of considerable 
value in determining the presence of mastitis-milk with a view 
to further detailed examination. 

Criticisms on this method have also been raised by Schuppius 
and Revis. Sassenhagen, using this method with the milk of cows 
suffering from mastitis, obtained as a rule an increase in the depth 
of the cellular deposit. He considers, however, that the test is not 
nearly so reliable as the presence of complement in a case of 
suspected mastitis. 

A somewhat different method was introduced by Savage, who 
centrifugalised I c.c. of milk in a tube, the lower end of which was 
drawn out to a smaller diameter than that of the main tube. 
Toison's fluid was added directly to the milk, which was then 
centrifuged at 1800 revolutions per minute. After centrifuging, 
the cream was shaken up with a clean glass rod to disentangle such 
cells as had risen with it. The tubes were then again centrifuged 
for ten minutes. The cream and fluid were then removed down 
to the i c.c. mark at the bottom of the tube. The cells in the fluid of 
this remaining cubic centimetre were then counted by means of the

Thoma-Zeiss apparatus. The leucocyte count was found to be 
extremely variable, extending from 40,000 to over 1,000,000 per c.c. 
Savage also investigated the cell content of milk at different stages 
of milking in the fore-milk.middle milk, and strippings respectively. 
He found that the middle milk usually showed the lowest count. 

Russell and Hoffmann (1907) used the Doane-Buckley method 
for counting the cells, but they showed that better results were 
obtained when the milk was previously heated to 70 C. before 
centrifuging. Even then, however, great variations in the cell 
content were obtained, and they did not feel able to fix any standard 
within which the cell content could be considered to be normal. 
They considered, however, that a high cell content was suggestive 
of some trouble of the udder, although this trouble might no longer 
be active. The figures found by them varied to between 4000 
and 1,000,000 cells per c.c. 

Campbell (1909) used the Doane-Buckley method, but after 
centrifuging removed the supernatant liquid only to the fifth or 
sixth mark. The tube was then filled up to the 10 c.c. mark with 
distilled water and recentrifuged. This was repeated until the 
upper surface of the liquid was transparent, when the supernatant 
fluid was removed down to the i c.c. mark. This remaining c.c. 
of sediment was thoroughly mixed, and the cells contained in it 
counted by means of a blood-counting apparatus. Campbell states 
that washing the cells several times before staining removed the fat 
globules more satisfactorily, and that no precipitate was obtained 
from the stain. 

Campbell also compared the results obtained by using the 
methods of Stokes, Stewart, Doane and Buckley, and Trommsdorff 
on the same samples of milk. The investigations carried out by 
Campbell in regard to the difference in the counts obtained when 
the milk was previously heated (as recommended by Russell and 
Hoffmann), and when the heating was omitted, are most striking. 
He has also investigated the cellular content of the fore-milk, 
middle milk, and strippings, with heat and without heat, and some 
characteristic findings are given in the following table :

MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



These figures were obtained from milk taken directly from 
the cow. Out of forty-two samples examined, in two cases only 
was a decrease in the number of cells obtained as a result of 
heating. In all the other cases an increase was observed, which 
varied from 12 per cent, (one sample only) to 1360 per cent, 
increase in the number of cells observed in the heated samples 
over the unheated. 

Similar results were obtained in the case of market milk, the 
average increase per cent, being, however, considerably higher as 
a result of heating, than in the case of the milk from a single cow. 

Campbell also showed that the analytical error is much smaller 
in samples of milk which have been heated to 70 C. than in un- 
heated samples. A number of examinations are given, of which 
the following may be taken as typical :

Campbell showed further, in a number of experiments, that the 
temperature to which the milk is raised has a marked effect upon 
the number of leucocytes found. Thus in one sample the following

He suggests that this fact might be utilised in determining 
whether milk had been previously heated or not. 

The increased leucocyte count obtained by Russell and Hoff- 
mann was believed by them to be due to alterations in the fat 
globule clusters. They state that milk when heated for ten minutes 
to 60 C. exhibits a great reduction in the creaming-power, 
which reduction appears to be due to the breakdown of the fat 
clusters. In rising to the surface these fat globules ordinarily 
entangle with them many leucocytes. When the fat-globule clusters 
are broken down by heat they are no longer capable of enmeshing 
the leucocytes as they rise in the milk on centrifuging. Campbell 
agrees with this explanation of the results obtained by heating milk, 
and believes also that the leucocytes settle more freely with the 
sediment as a result of becoming disintegrated from the fat globules 
due to the effect of heat. In unheated milk he believed that only 
a small proportion of the leucocytes settle with the sediment. 

Prescott and Breed (1910) investigated further methods for 
the estimation of the cell content of milk, and believed that accurate 
results can only be obtained when the milk is used without centri- 
fuging. They compared the methods in which the sediment is 
used and the results obtained when milk is used without previous 
manipulation. 

The method employed by them was as follows : A small quantity 
of milk (o'Oi c.c.), which has been carefully mixed but not centri- 
fugalised, is spread on an area of definitely known extent (i sq. cm.). 
The film is allowed to dry and the fat removed by washing with 
alcohol. The film is then stained with methylene blue and the cells 
counted. It is desirable to count 100 fields at random. Each cell 
found will represent 5000 cells per c.c. in the milk. These authors 
show that any method which involves the use of the centrifuge 
is very inaccurate, since a great number of the cells go up in the 
cream and many also lie in the fluid just below the cream. Only 
from 2-5-50 per cent, of the cells are found in the sediment as 
a result of centrifuging, and the variations obtained are too great 



I 4 2 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

to render the method reliable. The cell-count obtained by the 
use of the direct method was much higher than that obtained in 
the same sample of milk by the use of the other methods. These 
authors believe that the average number of cells present in milk 
is probably not less than 1,500,000 per c.c. 

Hewlett, Villar and Revis used about six drops of formalin to 
60 to 70 c.c. of milk before centrifuging, prior to staining, and to sub- 
sequent counting of the cells. They state that they compared this 
method with the heating method suggested by Russell and Hoff- 
mann and found that the two methods gave very similar results. 
They suggest that the action is due to a disruptive effect on the 
clusters of cells themselves, and consider it possible that heat or 
formalin break down aggregations of cells by destroying some 
agglutinating property rather than by an action upon the fat 
clusters. The destruction of the agglutinating substance would 
thus produce a more even distribution of the cells and cause an 
apparent numerical increase. They add that the carrying power 
of fat globules not only for cells but also for blood, bacteria, etc., 
may be broken down by either heat or formalin. 

These authors have also carried out investigations upon the 
best fluid to use for washing the cells. 

Ross (1912) heated the milk investigated by him for cellular 
content to ioo-i2O F. Ten c.c. of the milk was then centrifuged 
and the sediment content kept at i c.c. The sediment was then 
stained and the cells counted in the usual manner. 

The Cellular Content in Relation to Certain other Factors. 
The great irregularity of the cellular content of samples of milk 
from apparently normal cows has been shown in the preceding 
pages in connection with the methods of estimation. Some of 
the variations may perhaps be due to experimental error, but it 
is likely that there are normally very wide variations between the 
cell content of different samples of milk. Several investigators 
have endeavoured to ascertain the possible relationship between 
the cell content and other factors, such as the stages of lactation 
and an unhealthy condition of the gland, also minor factors, such 
as fat content and reaction of the milk. 

Stages oj Lactation. There is some diversity of opinion as to 
whether the cellular content is higher in colostrum than in later 
milk. 

Gratz and Maray believe that there is frequently no increase 
in leucocytes in colostral milk. 

Savage investigated a large number of samples of milk from 
individual cows. In regard to the period of lactation he was unable 
to trace any relationship with the leucocyte count, except in the 
case of cows which were also pregnant, when the number of cells 
tended to rise towards the end of lactation. The diminution of the 
amount of milk given was found to be associated with a rise in the 
number of leucocytes, and the less the amount of milk yielded, the 



THE CELLULAR CONTENT OF MILK 143 

higher the number of leucocytes found. Savage also investigated 
the varieties of leucocytes in the number of the estimations 
of total cellular content made by him. In definite pathological 
conditions the number of leucocytes was greatly increased, and 
there was a tendency for a high leucocyte count to persist in con- 
ditions of old trouble which was no longer active. This continued 
high cell count after the subsidency of inflammation has been pointed 
out by several observers who have investigated the cell content of 
milk. 1 

Hewlett, in the course of numerous investigations upon the cell 
content of the milk from a large number of cows, examined the milk 
from several cows in the later stages of lactation. In three cases no 
rise of cell content was obtained, and the cows were found to be 
non-pregnant. In a number of other cases the cell content was 
found to be high, but no connection could be traced either with 
the stage of lactation or with any unsatisfactory condition of the 
udder. 

Ross found no apparent relationship between the cell content 
and the amount of milk produced or with the fat content. Great 
variations were found between the different cows and also in the 
milk of the same cow at different times. As a whole, the cell content 
was higher in the stoppings than in the middle milk, which itself 
showed a higher cell content than the first milk. This agrees 
with the findings of Campbell quoted above. Ross believed that 
as a rule the cell content was higher in colostrum than in later 
milk, and was greatly increased in any inflammatory condition of 
the udder. 

Frick investigated the cell content in relation to the reaction 
of the milk, using Trommsdorff's method. Colostrum having an 
increased acidity over normal milk, was associated with a high 
leucocyte count. The leucocyte count of the later milk of cows 
depended upon whether the cow was pregnant or not. In the 
former case Frick obtained a reduced acidity of the milk and a 
raised leucocyte count. In the case of non-pregnant cows no 
change in the acidity or the leucocyte count from that of normal 
milk was found. 

Presence of Disease. There is very general agreement on the 
part of observers as to the rise in cell content which occurs in 
mastitis, although all are not agreed that a rise in cell content 
necessarily denotes mastitis. The results given above show that a 
high cell content may occur under numerous conditions which are 
not associated with mastitis. This disease in cows is caused by 
various bacteria, but in many instances is due to an infection from 
some form of streptococcus. Hence, if a high cell count is found to 
be associated with the presence of streptococcus, the suggestion that 
the two are connected and are diagnostic of mastitis is not an 

1 Cp. Hastings and Hoffmann, Hewlett, Villar and Revis, also Russell 
and Hoffmann. 



144 MILK AND [ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

unreasonable one. This view has been adopted by a number of 
workers, but not by all. 

Bergey (3) (1907), using Trommsdorff's method, believed that 
milk very generally contained leucocytes and streptoccoci. Should 
the content of both cells and streptococci rise together, this was 
diagnostic of a condition of mastitis. When this occurs he believes 
that an indurated area can usually be detected in the udder. 

Gminder and also Frick and Miller believed that in conditions 
of mastitis, leucocytes were present in excess together with strepto- 
cocci, while Savage obtained no definite relationship between the 
presence of a high cell count and streptococci. 

Gratz and Maray, and Seibold consider that there are no strepto- 
cocci in the milk obtained from a healthy cow, but this view is 
not borne out by the observations of numerous other workers. 
Thus streptococci were obtained in milk collected from cows who 
were entirely healthy as far as could be ascertained clinically by 
Bergey (i, 2) and Rosenow. There is, further, abundant evidence 
that the milk which is in the teats when milking is commenced 
contains bacteria, some of which may be streptococci. 1 

Hewlett has also given cases where streptococci were found 
in the milk, and that in the case of a cow who ' ran her milk.' The 
presence of streptococci was accompanied by a high cell content, 
but no disease which could be described as mastitis of an acute 
or suppurative type was found. 

Lewis does not consider that any standard of cells is possible 
as a means of diagnosing disease, even when there are clumps of 
cells, unless these are definitely polymorphonudear or eosinophile 
cells, either with or without the accompaniment of streptococci. 
He agrees with Campbell and Ross, quoted above, that there are 
usually more cells in the strippings than in the rest of the milk. 
The work of Rullmann, Pennington and Roberts may also be 
compared. 

It has been suggested by numerous authors that the organisms 
found in the first milk have gained access to the inside of the teat 
from the exterior. Streptococci are readily found on the udder, 
and there is no difficulty in supposing that they occur also on the 
outside of the teats and probably are able to pass some way up the 
ducts. 

The whole question of cell content and its relation to the presence 
of streptococci was carefully investigated in America by the New 
York Milk Committee, and in 1912 they reported their considered 
opinion. No more recent work has appeared to alter the opinions 
there expressed. The Committee say : 

'No method has yet been accepted for accurately distin- 
guishing between the pus cells and other cells that may be 
in the milk that do not have an origin in inflammatory 

1 Cp. Freudenreich. 



THE CELLULAR CONTENT OF MILK 145 

conditions. Some regard noticeably clumped cells as indicat- 
ing pus, stating that upon proper incubation all such dumpings 
may be found to be accompanied by chain-forming streptococci. 
Others regard all polymorphonuclear neutrophilic cells as pus. 
Most, however, at the present time fail to recognise any method 
of clearly distinguishing pus from tissue cells. 

'A general consensus of opinion has been reached that a high 
cell count should not alone condemn milk, although it is a matter 
for suspicion. The cell count varies with the same cow upon 
different days and it may be increased by simply manipulating 
the udders. ... A high cell count accompanied by streptococci 
apparently always indicates udder troubles. In many cases these 
have been followed up to the dairy, and where this has been done 
it is almost always possible to find the source in some cow suffering 
from some trouble in its udder/ 

The report of the Committee indicates that all cases of high 
cell count accompanied by streptococci should be regarded with 
suspicion. Many observers, however, do not go so far, and are 
disposed to require an investigation of the variety of the strain 
of streptococcus present. The question of the pathogenicity of 
strains of streptococci is considered in Chap. XV.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER VIII 

BREAST-FEEDING 

IT is not easy to present a concise summary of the work which has 
been carried out upon breast-feeding, the importance of which it is 
difficult to over-estimate. The evidence brought forward gives 
no support to the statements which have been made to the effect 
that the capacity for lactation is decreasing among women. Where 
care is exercised and adequate attention paid to the necessary 
details, the glands can in nearly all cases be brought into the 
required degree of activity. 

Experience both in this country and in other countries shows 
the advantage of allowing sufficient interval to elapse between the 
times of feeding. There is abundant evidence to show that the 
activity of the mammary gland depends greatly upon the stimulus 
which it receives. Where high demands are made upon it, a much 
greater amount of milk is secreted, and vice versa. The output 
of milk is affected when the food-supply of the mother falls below 
the physiological limit. 



CHAPTER VIII 

BREAST-FEEDING 

THE investigations which have been made in many countries into 
the causes of the infantile death-rate have revealed a close connection 
between the number of infants who are breast-fed and the number 
who survive the first year of life. Setting aside the other factors 
affecting infant life, the naturally-fed infant has a greatly superior 
chance of surviving than its artificially-fed brother. During the 
latter part of the nineteenth century a decrease appears to have 
occurred in the amount of breast-feeding. This has been attributed 
by some writers to a decrease in the capacity of the female of 

147 L 2 



148 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

the human species for the fulfilment of the function of lactation. 
Bunge, as a result of investigations carried out by questionnaires 
to a number of doctors in Switzerland, believed that the period 
of lactation was becoming shortened. It appears probable that 
the period over which lactation extended in earlier times was 
considerably longer than that which is now customary. Even 
if this is correct, it does not necessarily follow that the duration 
of capacity for lactation has undergone a change. No reliable 
records as to the state of infant mortality in previous centuries 
are available, and it is not unlikely that the period of lactation 
was more prolonged than was really advisable. In some districts 
in this country at the present time, many women continue to suckle 
their babies until well on into the second year of life, often with 
unsatisfactory results both to mother and child. The present 
unnatural conditions of life may tend to produce detrimental 
effects upon a large number of individual women, but it is hardly 
likely that the capacity of the race for lactation has as yet been 
appreciably affected. 

In this chapter the advisability of breast-feeding will be assumed. 
It remains to consider the present state of knowledge as to the 
best methods to secure the possibility of breast-feeding. Bunge 's 
work referred to above was subject to some degree of misinter- 
pretation, many readers believing that he considered the function 
of lactation to be on the decline. This, as has been mentioned 
above, is not precisely the point of view to which Bunge was led 
as the result of his investigations. 

The movement for the preservation of infant life and health 
which spread over a large part of Europe and in America with aston- 
ishing rapidity during the last quarter of a century, has thrown 
a flood of light upon the whole question of breast-feeding. The 
institutions which have been established for the welfare of mothers 
and infants differ in their methods according to the characteristics 
of the country in which they are found. All, however, have assisted 
in providing data upon this subject, and the results obtained, 
although differing in certain points of detail, have been funda- 
mentally confirmatory of one another. 

Two main points will be considered in this chapter: (i) 
The existing capacity for the function of lactation in the human 
species, and (2) the period of lactation. 

i. The Capacity for Lactation. There can be little doubt that 
with few exceptions lactation can be established in every woman. 
Increased experience has shown that the difficulties which exist 
in a certain proportion of cases can be satisfactorily surmounted 
in nearly every instance. In foreign institutions where wet- 
nurses are frequently used it is recognised that there are fairly 
wide variations between the extent of the capacity for lactation 
in different women, yet it is exceptional to find cases where 
this cannot be established. Budin (i) says : ' Every woman 



BREAST-FEEDING 149 

I deliver must suckle while in hospital. When she leaves the 
clinic she is usually both willing and able to nurse.' Thiemich 
says : ' It happens so rarely that the breast of a lying-in woman 
gives no secretion that it plays no part in practice. . . . 
Sometimes it may be 48 hours after birth before practically 
any colostrum can be pressed out of the breast, and yet after a 
little while the secretion of milk reaches a satisfactory height, if 
the child is put to the breast regularly and sucks strongly.' 1 On 
February 5, 1914, Professor Pinard stated to the French Academy 
of Medicine that out of 12,000 cases of confinement which had 
occurred in the hospitals in Paris in the previous five months, there 
had been none in which lactation had not been possible. He 
added that he regarded a lying-in woman who had no milk as 
being an abnormal person. 

An important factor appears to lie in the infant itself. The 
response of the pland varies with the stimulus given to it by suck- 
ling, and if the infant be feeble the stimulus may not be great 
enough adequately to establish the function of lactation, which 
is thus retarded. This difficulty, unless overcome, will probably 
lead to the abandonment of breast-feeding. The strength of 
stimulus can easily be improved either by temporarily supple- 
menting the feeding or by allowing a stronger child to supply 
the necessary increased stimulus. 1 

There is no reason to suppose that the capacity for the establish- 
ment of lactation among Englishwomen is less than that among 
the women of countries quoted above. The information as to the 
method of feeding which is obtained in numerous towns throughout 
this country by the municipal health visitors shows that it is by 
no means unusual to find that 80 per cent, or more of the women 
nurse their babies for at least the first fortnight after birth, within 
which period the visit by the health visitor is paid.* The figures 
given do not show the extent of the capacity for breast-feeding, 
as some mothers have already put the child on the bottle, before 
the advent of the health visitor, in spite of the presence of plenty 
of milk in the gland. Further, there are some women who make 
no effort to secure the establishment of lactation, as they do not 
wish to suckle the baby. If the value of natural feeding were 
realised it can hardly be doubted that the capacity for breast- 
feeding would be found to be practically universal among the 
women of England. Thus the Inspector of Midwives for 
Northamptonshire says : 

' The important matter of breast-feeding has been kept well 
before the midwives, and, from inquiries made, I find that out of 
1854 live births occurring in their practice, 1799 were breast-fed 

1 Cp. also Engel (i).

150 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

while the midwife was in attendance, but I am sorry to say in 
many instances this has been given up for the bottle when the 
midwife has ceased her visits.' 1 

And the Medical Officer of Health for St. Helens says : 

' A high percentage (97 per cent.) of infants were breast-fed 
at the time of the first visit, but there is reason to believe that this 
is discontinued within a short period.' ' 

These instances might be multiplied many times, but enough 
evidence has probably been brought forward to show that the 
capacity for lactation may still be regarded as universally present 
in the female of the human species. 

2. The Period of Lactation. It is frequently stated that, 
although lactation may be established, it is not possible to main- 
tain it for the necessary period. This statement has led many 
persons to the belief that the capacity for sustained lactation 
is decreasing among women. 

It may be at once admitted that on the surface there appears 
to be some truth in this statement. Inquiry and investigation 
show, however, that where due regard is paid to the requirements 
of the gland the difficulties are apparent rather than real, and 
can in almost all cases be removed. 

The knowledge which has been obtained as to the functions 
of the human mammary gland has come almost entirely from 
countries outside our own. The chief cause of this is probably 
to be found in the more common use of wet-nurses in foreign 
countries, especially in institutions for sick children. 

It is curious that in considering this matter so little attention 
has been paid to the method of action of the mammary glands of 
lower animals, more especially to that of the humble cow. There 
has, however, been no lack of readiness to rely upon the organ 
of this animal instead of attempting to ascertain why it was, 
that the gland of the cow continued to give milk and that 
of the human species did not do so. The functions of the 
various organs are fundamentally similar throughout the animal 
kingdom, and knowledge gained as to the functions of an 
organ in one species can frequently be applied to that of the 
human species. 

It is a matter of common knowledge to the dairy farmer, that 
unless the udder be emptied at each milking, and unless the milkings 
take place at sufficiently frequent intervals, the cow will no longer 
give her full quantity of milk, and will in fact soon cease to give 
milk altogether. 

The growth of the movement for ' clean milk ' in America 
led to the introduction of the milking machine for cows. It was 
found at first that the machine did not empty the udder and that 
the cows ceased to give milk much sooner than would have been the 

1 R.A., Co. M.O.H., 1912, pp. 48, 49. 2 A.R., 1914, p. 418. 



BREAST-FEEDING 151 

case had they been milked by hand. This proved a source of 
considerable financial loss to the farmers. 

The same causes operate in the human species in reducing the 
period of lactation. 

Unless the gland is emptied completely the functions will not 
be maintained. The child should not be fed so frequently that it 
is not hungry when fed. Unless it is hungry it will probably not 
empty the gland. The practice of feeding a baby every two hours 
during the day and every four hours at night during the early 
months is unfortunately still too common in this country. 

The work of Leven and Barratt, and also of Tobler and Bogen, 
upon the time required for digestion in the infant's stomach, 
suggests that this organ is seldom emptied in less than two 
hours after a meal, hence there is no rest for the stomach of the 
infant which is fed every two hours. These authors found that the 
progress of digestion in the infant's stomach could be studied with 
the X-rays without the addition of bismuth to the food. Various 
quantities of milk, both human and cows' milk, were given to the 
infants in the amounts and dilutions which are generally employed 
in the feeding of infants. It is an interesting point that in both 
sets of observations a high fat content was found to lengthen the 
time required for digestion. 

It is well known that the end milk of the cow contains the bulk 
of the fat. This is also the case in human milk (cp. Chap. II, 
pp. 23-24). Hence the child who is fed too frequently to be 
hungry not only does not give the full physiological stimulus 
to the gland, but obtains only a fraction, of the available fatty 
portion of the food. 

Frequent feeding will therefore have a deleterious effect both 
on the infant and on the milk supply, tending to cause both a 
shortened period of lactation and to induce unsatisfactory nutritive 
conditions in the child owing to a deficiency of fat. A vicious 
circle is thus set up which leads to weaning, as the mother usually 
becomes convinced that the child is not satisfied with her milk. 
Night-feeding is also detrimental to the mother, as it prevents 
her from receiving the restful sleep which she needs. 

Numerous observers have investigated the amounts of milk 
given by a mother during the whole period of lactation. 1 It is 
found that the amount given gradually increases during the early 
weeks, remaining practically constant until just before the end 
of lactation. Diagram 3 (see next page) shows (i) the rise and 
maintenance of the quantity of milk given, together with the 
weight charts of the children, and (2) that good weight charts 
may be shown by children taking different quantities of milk. 
There is clearly a considerable power of adaptation between the 
needs of the individual child and the function of the breast.

proportion between the rate of growth and the amount of milk 
taken. 

The Response to an Increased Stimulus. Several investigators 
have shown that the amount of milk given by the gland can be 
increased by increasing the demand upon it. Budin showed that if 
a wet-nurse was called upon to feed more than one child, her milk 
increased in amount ; and, up to a certain limit, varied with the 
number of children she was feeding. Similar results were shown 
by Schlossmann, and more recently by Brodsky and also by 
Aurnhammer. In order to demonstrate this the following diagram

Bi Shows amount taken by the other children.

and the number of children fed. 

has been prepared from one set of Budin 's figures. Other figures 
by Budin and also by Schlossmann are given in Appendix A. 

Diagram 5 shows the very remarkable response made by the 
gland to an additional stimulus. The marked temporary drop in 
the quantity of milk given which occurred on two occasions when 
the number of children fed was reduced is extremely interesting. 
Birk also deals with the increased response of the gland to the 
demand put upon it, and points out that care should be taken to 
avoid overtaxing the strength of the mother. 

Some interesting points in connection with the intervals of 
feeding were also ascertained by Helbich. This observer obtained 



BREAST-FEEDING 



155 



the total amount of milk given at different intervals by a nursing 
mother. The amount of milk given was ascertained partly by 
mechanical removal and partly by weighing the infant before and 
after suckling, by which method the amount taken by the infant 
is given. The figures thus obtained were added and showed the 
total amount given at each occasion. The diagram below has been 
prepared to show these points, and is taken from Helbich's figures. 




DIAGRAM 6. Showing the effect of the intervals of feeding on the amount of 
milk obtained after each interval. 

Each column shows the total amount of milk given each day. The divisions 
in each column show the amounts given at each occasion when the gland 
was emptied. 

With five periods of suckling in the twenty-four hours, i.e. four 
hours in the daytime and eight hours at night, the amount given 
in the morning greatly exceeded the others. When, however, 
the intervals were made equal, that is eight hourly, the amounts 
of milk given on each occasion became approximately equal. 

On the fifth day of the experiment the procedure was altered 
and the milk was withdrawn three times a day at eight-hourly 
intervals, namely, at 5.30 A.M., 1.30 P.M., and 9.30 P.M. The result 
was three large, almost equal, amounts of milk, the total of which 
equalled the quantity obtained daily under the former conditions. 

It is interesting to note that while the secretion was well main- 
tained for six and a half months when the removal of milk was 
made five times in the day, it began to fall off slightly after three 



156 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

weeks when removal was only practised three times a day. This fact 
is of considerable importance in connection with mixed feeding. 
Mixed feeding, i.e. giving both human and cows' milk to the same 
infant at the same period of life, is now universally accepted as 
greatly superior to artificial feeding alone. The practical difficulty, 
however, is that just referred to, namely, that when the gland 
is only emptied two or three times in the day the secretion tends 
to decrease. 

The greater equality in the amount given which results from 
the less frequent intervals of feeding has been recently further 
demonstrated in this country by H. K. Waller, who showed that 
if the child is only fed three times in the twenty-four hours 
the amounts become more equal (in one case 14, 12, and n oz. 
respectively). 

General experience has shown that mechanical means for 
emptying the mammary gland are much less effective than suckling 
the infant. The last portions of the milk cannot easily be removed 
by the usual apparatus, which will, however, remove the greater 
portion of the supply. Hence, the gland subjected to mechanical 
emptying only, will usually cease to produce milk. Helbich, 
however, with care, succeeded in maintaining the function of the 
gland in several wet-nurses for many weeks, when the breast was 
emptied artificially only. 

Out of the numerous cases described in detail by Helbich, two 
will provide illustrations of the main results : 

Case A . The child was ten days old when it came under observation for 
this experiment. It then weighed 1900 grammes (rather over 4 Ibs.). The 
child was too weak to obtain the milk from the breast, and the milk was, there- 
fore, drawn off artificially. The child died a fortnight later. The mother was 
then instructed to draw off the milk with the breast-pump. The daily amount 
of milk, which at the beginning of the period of observation was about 300 
400 grammes, rose to about 800 grammes before the child died, and continued 
to rise gradually until 10 weeks later it had reached a fairly constant 
level of 1300 grammes. 

Case B. The child was fourteen days old when the observations were com- 
menced, and was too weak to obtain sufficient nourishment by suckling. At 
first the amount of milk which could be obtained artificially from the breast 
amounted only to a few grammes in the day. A week later the child died, and 
the daily amount of milk given had then reached 300-400 grammes in all, 
including that taken by the child. Artificial removal of the milk was 
continued, but for about five weeks did not exceed 400-500 grammes a day. 
It then gradually rose, and in the next five or six weeks reached about 1300 
grammes, a maximum of 1500 grammes being attained later. The amount 
remained at about 1400 grammes until the patient left the hospital, the milk 
having been withdrawn artificially for 21 weeks. 

So far, in considering the function of lactation, it has been 
assumed that satisfactory conditions were provided for the maternal 
organism, upon which the gland depends for its blood supply. It 
is essential that the food supply for the mother should be sufficient 
and suitable. Remarks are frequently found upon the value of 



BREAST-FEEDING 157 

various special foods or substances in the production of milk. 
The available evidence is to the effect that no special influence upon 
the secretion of milk is exercised by any one particular substance 
directly. 

What is really essential is that there should be a sufficient 
amount of food taken, which must contain a sufficiency of the 
materials essential for the daily life of the maternal organism, 
i.e. there must be enough protein, fat, carbohydrate, salts and 
water. Schlossmann in 1900 quoted several cases which had come 
into his practice where the wet-nurses had a plentiful supply of milk 
while in the institution. Here the food was ample, reasonably 
varied, perhaps rather coarse, but what each woman was accustomed 
to in her own home. On being sent as wet-nurse to a private 
house, a woman not infrequently lost her milk. Inquiry showed 
that although sufficient food was provided, frequently of a highly 
nutritious kind, it was not such as the woman liked. In conse- 
quence she would not eat it, and the milk supply failed after a short 
period. When she returned to the institution the milk supply 
was restored. 

A considerable amount of work has been carried out upon the 
relation of the amount of milk secreted by cows to special con- 
stituents of the food. This has already been considered in 
Chaps. II and IV, where it was shown that unless any particular 
constituent of the food is decreased beyond the physiological limit 
for the organism the amount of milk given by the gland is not 
affected. When the amount of any essential constituent falls 
below the physiological limit, the supply also falls. 

It would seem that the milk given by cows can be to some 
extent increased by an additional amount of food, and that if 
the food-supply is diminished below the physiological limit, the 
amount of milk produced falls off. Conversely, if the amount of 
food-stuff is increased, it is possible to increase the amount of 
milk to some degree, although the increase is not proportional 
to the amount of food given. 1 This subject is also dealt with 
by Claus, who showed that a decrease in the food reduces the 
amount of milk given, and he suggests that the expense of the addi- 
tional food might be greater than the value of the corresponding 
milk produced, and that it might pay farmers better to give less 
food and obtain rather less milk. 

It is probable that many cases of failure of lactation in women 
have been caused by the absence of proper nourishment for the 
mother. The experience which has been gained at institutions, 
where dinners for nursing mothers are provided, is to the same 
effect. The published figures available from these dining centres 
are somewhat fragmentary and for the most part too few in number 
for considerable stress to be laid upon the experience obtained 

1 Cp. table on p. 21. 



158 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

from any one centre. Where, however, although each centre is 
individually small, the experience runs along identical lines, 
some reliance may be placed upon the general results obtained. 
It is the opinion of the officers who supervise the work at 
these centres that the provision of an adequate food-supply for 
the mother almost invariably enables breast-feeding to be main- 
tained, mothers who have previously been unable to feed their 
children being able to do so without difficulty when provided with 
sufficient food of a suitable nature. Moreover, in many instances, 
where the milk-supply was becoming apparently short, it has been 
completely regained, and lactation continued up to the ninth month. 

No special foods or substances are either indicated or contra- 
indicated. The health of the mother must be maintained. Where 
this is affected owing to the idiosyncrasy of the individual for any 
particular food-stuff, that food-stuff should be avoided that is all. 

Birk considers the question of an increased output, obtained 
as a result of increasing the number of children fed, in relation to the 
health of the mother. He found that where several infants were 
fed by one mother, the amount of energy taken in, in the food of 
the mother, might not be sufficient. In several cases investigated 
by him he found that the residual energy available for the mother, 
after deducting the energy given off in the milk, was below that 
usually considered sufficient for health. He thinks the question 
probably does not arise when only one child is fed, but in other 
cases he suggests that attention should be paid to the energy require- 
ments of the mother, especially to the inorganic salts in the food. 

Bamberg, however, does not take quite the same view, and 
regards the output of milk as to some degree controlled by a self- 
regulating mechanism. He estimated the heat value of the food 
taken and of the milk given out by several women who were suckling 
more than one child. In several cases he found that there was 
not enough difference between the two values to provide the 
theoretical amount of calories per kilogram of body-weight for the 
mother. These women, however, appeared to be quite well, did 
a fair amount of work, and did not lose weight. These practical 
points appear to outweigh the theoretical question of calories 
needed, and led him to the conclusion that the total output of 
milk was regulated so as not unduly to deplete the maternal 
organism. 

Budin's tables 1 show that a considerable supply of milk 
may be given for sixty-four weeks, and this has already been 
referred to as occurring in this country. General experience, 
and considerations arising out of the composition of milk after 
about the eighth month of lactation, fixes the length of lactation 
at from six to nine months, the longer period being a very usual 
one. 

1 Cp. Appendix A. 



BREAST-FEEDING 159 

In the series of 300 breast-fed infants whose records were 
examined by me for the purpose of a report to the Local Government 
Board, where all the babies had been fed on the breast up to the 
age of four months, it was found that 52 out of the 300 had been 
weaned between the ages of four and six months (some possibly 
for other reasons than the failure of the milk), but that the great 
majority were not weaned until nine months of age. The weight 
charts, however, suggested that although the supply was sufficient 
for the needs of the infant, the optimum rate of growth was not 
secured in all cases for the full period of nine months. See 
Chap. XL 

It is stated, however, by Finkelstein, Schlossmann (2), Engel 
(2), and others that there is practically no limit to the period of 
lactation of a good wet-nurse, and that the breast will continue to 
secrete a good quantity of milk so long as the stimulus of suckling is 
supplied. It is doubtful how far this can be considered generally 
applicable to the mother of a family, the conditions in institutions 
being of a somewhat unusual nature. 

Later Effects of Breast-feeding. The later results of breast- 
feeding as compared with artificial feeding have not been adequately 
investigated. 

The question of rickets in relation to breast-feeding will be 
considered in Chap. XIII. 

The low mortality among breast-fed infants during the first 
year of life, as compared with that among the artificially-fed 
infants, has been so fully demonstrated that it is unnecessary 
to deal with the matter here. Further information may be ob- 
tained in Chap. XIV of the Supplement to the 42nd Report of the 
Medical Officer of the Local Government Board. (See under 
Newsholme.) 

The health of breast-fed children after the period of infancy is 
considered briefly in Appendix B.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER IX 

ON THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF BOILED MILK OF THE SAME SPECIES 

IT may appear at first sight that it would always be superfluous 
to boil the milk for the young of the same species. This procedure 
may, however, be necessary in special cases, where there is danger 
of disease in the mother becoming transmitted to the offspring 
through the milk. 

Human Milk. In this country the question of boiling human 
milk may be said not to arise, but in other countries where wet- 
nurses are used, it becomes a matter of considerable importance. 
It is well known that hereditary disease can be transmitted by 
suckling. A mother suffering from syphilitic disease can infect 
the healthy child of another woman, if she suckles it. This danger 
is perhaps the most prominent difficulty in connection with wet- 
nursing. It is sometimes almost impossible to be certain that 
the wet-nurse is free from this disease, and the first positive informa- 
tion upon this matter may arise from the occurrence of the disease 
in the child she has suckled. In order to avoid this danger, it 
is not uncommon in countries where wet-nurses are extensively 
used in institutions and among the richer classes, to instruct the 
wet-nurse to express from the breast any milk for other children 
beside her own child. This milk is then boiled before being used. 
Boiling removes the danger of the transmission of the disease, but 
the possible loss of nutritive value by this procedure must be 
taken into consideration. Very few detailed investigations are 
available upon this point, and in such cases as have been published 
the data are not sufficiently extensive for any precise decision to 
be arrived at. In actual practice the procedure has been com- 
paratively frequently carried out, and although no precise statistics 
are available upon the subject, it is generally believed by those 
who have had most experience upon this matter, that little, if any, 
impairment of nutritive value is produced by boiling the milk. 

Cows' Milk. The problem of the nutritive value of boiled cows' 
milk as a food for calves is one of practical importance to the agricul- 
turist. It is of special importance in those countries where the 
sale of tuberculous milk is universally prohibited and the pro- 

161 M 



162 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

hibition strictly enforced. Under these circumstances the milk 
of tuberculous cows is useless as a market commodity in its raw 
state, and it becomes a matter of considerable financial importance 
to the farmer to be informed what he can do in order to obtain 
some return for the milk produced by tuberculous cows. 

The problem has been attacked practically in Denmark under 
the direction of Professor Bang, of Copenhagen. Here the milk of 
tuberculous cows is boiled and is then fed to their calves, with 
results which are said to be entirely satisfactory. Unfortunately, 
precise data upon this point are not available. 

Valuable work along this line has also been carried out by 
Hittcher, whose work shows the value of an adequate and suitable 
salt content in the food. He emphasises the importance of carrying 
out experiments over a sufficiently long period, and also of taking 
into consideration the age of the animal. Growth is more rapid 
in the early weeks than later, and much confusion may arise unless 
this fact is recognised, especially when the amount of food taken 
in relation to the body weight, and the increase in body weight, 
have to be considered. The amount of food required in the feeding 
of animals is a matter of extreme importance to the farmer, and 
may just make the difference between financial loss and gain. 
Hittcher's experiments show that, with the addition of salt, boiled 
milk appears to be better utilised by the calves than raw milk. It 
seems clear from the work in Denmark and from Hittcher's experi- 
ments that calves may be fed quite satisfactorily upon the boiled 
milk of their tuberculous mothers. 



CHAPTER IX 

ON THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF BOILED MILK OF THE SAME 

SPECIES 

1. Human Milk. The experiments which have been made upon 
the use of boiled human milk are not numerous. In this country 
no experiments have been performed, and, as wet-nurses are not 
used, little practical value attaches to the whole matter. 

The work hitherto undertaken in other countries has been 
mainly carried out on individual children, which renders it difficult 
to survey the investigations briefly. The results are somewhat 
varied, partly, no doubt, owing to the different conditions under 
which the experiments were conducted. The work, the greater 
part of which was originally prepared by me for a report to the 
L.G.B., is therefore necessarily given in considerable detail. 

Moro (1902) describes two cases of weakly children who received 
first of all the breast, and were then fed upon the expressed milk, 
which had been boiled for ten minutes. The children showed a 



BOILED MILK OF THE SAME SPECIES 163 

markedly inferior gain in weight upon the boiled human milk, 
to that which they exhibited upon the breast milk. 
The average gain in weight noted was as follows : 

In case I : 

In fourteen days on the breast the average gain was 26^ 

grammes per day. 
In eight days on the bottle with raw human milk the 

average gain was 37 grammes per day. 
In ten days on boiled human milk the figure was 9-9 grammes 

per day. 

In case II : 

In seven days the average gain on the breast was 14 grammes 

per day. 
In five days on raw human milk in a bottle it was 20 grammes 

per day. 
In seven days on boiled human milk it was 9 grammes 

per day. 

It would be unwise to base any assertions upon two experiments, 
but as far as the experiments go, it would appear that some of the 
value of the human milk is lost by boiling. It is curious that both 
children showed a greatly increased average gain per day, when 
fed upon the human milk in a bottle as compared with the breast, 
and this rather suggests that they were getting more actual food in 
the shape of a larger quantity of milk. It might be that different 
results would have been obtained if the milk had not been boiled for 
as long a time as ten minutes. Moro attributes the effect pro- 
duced to a loss of the so-called ' protective substances ' of the milk. 

L. F. Meyer (1906), in the course of his ' Exchange ' experiments, 
where three children were fed first upon human whey and the protein 
of cows' milk, and then upon cows' milk and the protein of human 
milk, found that if the human whey was boiled the good results 
obtained with the first mode of feeding were greatly reduced. 
As, however, the experiment was only carried out over a very 
few days, and was an isolated one, it cannot be taken as proving 
that substances necessary for health are lost by the boiling of milk. 

It would appear also that Meyer himself does not lay much 
stress upon this experiment, since in his book (1910) in conjunction 
with Langstein he says, ' clinical observations could not show any 
advantage of raw cows' milk over boiled, and recent experiments 
have also shown that the boiling of human milk does not cause 
any deterioration of its nutritive value. ' \ 

Potpeschnig (1907) carried out some work with a view to ascer- 
taining whether these same hypothetical substances said to have 
a protective function were injured by heating to 60 C., this being 
the temperature to which v. Behring considered that milk might 
safely be heated without undergoing any loss of nutritive value. 



164 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

Two children, both premature, were fed at the breast of a 
wet-nurse until it was evident that they were doing well, and the 
weight-curve showed a daily satisfactory increase. This was 
for a period of three days. The children then received the milk 
after it had been expressed and kept cool, all aseptic precautions 
being taken. Both children showed a transient loss of weight, 
but in a few days the weight curve again began to rise, and showed 
a steady increase. This period lasted five days. 

The expressed milk was now heated to 60 C. for half an hour, 
and was then stored in the cold room for use as required. The 
period of this form of feeding lasted seventeen days, and the weight- 
curve showed a steady rise throughout the entire period, nor could 
a disturbance of any kind be detected. After this, the wet-nurses 
being no longer available, the children received boiled cows' milk, 
and the weight-curves continued to rise just as steadily as with 
the boiled human milk. 

The author considers that these children are no criterion, since 
they did as well upon boiled cows' milk as upon human milk, 
and thus he says were evidently capable of manufacturing their 
own ' protective substances.' The basis for this statement is 
hardly satisfactory. 

E. Miiller (1908) carried out a very interesting experiment 
upon a child under his care. This baby was premature and weakly, 
and was twenty-five days old when it came under his treatment. 
The child was first of all put upon the breast of a wet nurse, and 
made very little progress, the average gain in weight being 12 
grammes per day. The baby was therefore put upon a diet of 
raw human whey and raw cows' fat and casein ; this feeding was 
continued for five days, during which time the child gained weight 
at the rate of 44 grammes per day. The author considered this 
increased gain in weight due to the increase of protein material 
in the food. Next it received cows' whey and human fat and 
casein, both raw, for fourteen days, but the results obtained were 
not similar throughout the period. For the first five days the 
child made good progress and put on weight at the rate of 33 
grammes per day, but during the last nine days it only gained 
30 grammes in the whole period. There was also a tendency to 
diarrhoea. It was then put back upon human whey and cows' 
casein and fat, and again made good progress, gaining 17 grammes 
per day for three days. The human whey was now boiled and 
mixed with the cows' casein and fat, and the child gained in weight 
at the rate of 15 grammes per day for thirty-three days. It would 
seem, therefore, that no harm was done to the nutritive properties 
of the human whey by boiling. 

Miiller points out that the upholders of the theory of ' pro- 
tective substances ' in milk all agree that these are present in 
the whey ; hence this case in which he fed a weakly child with 
success upon boiled whey (in which presumably these same sub- 
stances, if present, were destroyed) is of considerable interest. 



BOILED MILK OF THE SAME SPECIES 165 

Finkelstein mentions that he fed six babies upon boiled 
mother's milk, and found that they did not do so well as upon 
the raw human milk, and concludes therefore that the milk of 
the same species loses some of its value by boiling ; in contra- 
distinction to that of a foreign species. He does not give any 
data upon this point. 

The most numerous cases I have been able to discover are those 
of Professor Thiemich of Magdeburg. They are unfortunately 
as yet unpublished, although the data are available, but Professor 
Thiemich was so kind as to give permission to me to quote his 
experiences for the purpose of my report to the L.G.B. He 
furnished me with a short report of his results, as follows : ' In my 
wards the milk of all the new wet-nurses is given boiled only, until 
Wasserman's and Stern's reactions 1 have been carried out. 

' If it happens, as it frequently does, that one or other of the 
reactions is positive or doubtful, and there is no detectable evidence 
of specific trouble in either mother or child, I sometimes keep the 
wet-nurse for many months, and during the whole of this period 
her milk is only given boiled. I may add that in the case of an 
infant living with its parents which requires a wet-nurse or human 
milk for " allaitement mixte " it is only in very exceptional cases 
that I allow actual suckling. Otherwise only expressed and boiled 
milk, human milk, is given by the bottle in suitable quantities. 
Similarly the milk of a feverish wet-nurse is boiled, not because 
of the risk of the direct passage of any organisms in the milk, 
but because of the possibility of outside contamination of the milk. 

' On this system I have now seen a great number of children 
improve just as well upon boiled human milk, as happens with 
raw human milk. 

' In a smaller number of cases raw and boiled human milk 
have been given alternately and systematically for various periods 
of days and we* ks with the same result, namely, that no difference 
could be detected.' 

The data are not extensive, and while no decisive pronounce- 
ment can be made upon the subject there is considerable evidence 
that no marked impairment in nutritive value is produced by 
boiling human milk. 

2. Cows' Milk. The evidence as to the nutritive value 
of boiled cows' milk for calves is of a very similar nature to that 
in the case of human milk. 

Th) detailed experiments have with one notable exception 
(Hittcher) all been on a very small number of calves. Where, 
as in Denmark, the experiment has been conducted upon a large 
scale, no precise data are available. An account of the investi- 
gations is given in chronological order. 

The first work appears to be that by Gerlach, who found 
that calves fed upon boiled milk from birth did not do well after 

1 Stern's reaction is a modification of Wassermann's, and apparently 
sometimes clears up a doubtful diagnosis obtained by Wassermann's method. 



166 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

about four days. All trouble ceased, however, after the addition 
of sodium chloride, and the calves did excellently upon the boiled 
milk. After about a year, calves fed by this method again began 
to do badly, and it was ascertained that the salt had been omitted. 
These facts are very interesting, especially in conjunction with the 
experiments of Hittcher, recorded below. 

The experiments of Price, and of Doane and Price in America, 
certainly point to there being a disadvantage in the sterilisation 
of cows' milk. This food produced diarrhoea in some of the calves 
used. 

Calves were also fed upon raw, boiled or pasteurised milk and 
sterilised milk, by Price, who found that the calves fed upon raw 
milk did the best. Four calves were used, and were fed for three 
days at a time upon the different forms of milk. Sterilised milk 
produced scouring in three out of the four calves. This milk was 
heated to 190 F. for half an hour. 

No data are given as to the age of the calf or the amount of 
milk given. 

One of the calves was found to digest the sterilised milk as 
well as the other forms of milk. 

H. H. Dean carried out some work upon calves fed upon 
raw and pasteurised skim milk. He used four calves ; two were 
fed for the first four weeks of the experiment upon raw, and two 
upon pasteurised milk. After a week's interval the feeding was 
reversed, and those which had received raw milk now received 
pasteurised milk and vice versa. The calves also received other 
food. The weights of the calves and the weight of food taken 
were recorded. Dean concluded that no difference between the 
two kinds of feeding could be detected, and recommended the 
pasteurising of skim milk before it is given to calves. 

A successful campaign has been waged in Denmark against 
tuberculosis, under the auspices of Prof. Bang of Copenhagen, by 
the simple process of boiling the milk of tuberculous cows before 
giving it to the calves. Unfortunately no data as to the weight 
or rate of growth of the calves during the course of the feeding 
with boiled milk are available. I am informed by Prof. Bang 
that the method has now been applied in many hundreds of cases, 
and has been found to be entirely satisfactory. The calves are 
taken away from the tuberculous mother at birth, and are fed 
for two days upon raw cows' milk, after which they receive the 
milk of their tuberculous mother, either boiled or raised to a 
temperature of 80 C. 

Hittcher has carried out some important work upon the 
value of boiled and raw cows' milk as a food for calves, with and 
without the addition of certain salts. He first ascertained which 
salts would restore to boiled milk the property of clotting with 
rennet. He then performed a series of experiments in the course 
of which seventy-two calves were fed upon raw and boiled milk, 



BOILED MILK OF THE SAME SPECIES 



167 



to which, in many cases, one of these salts had been added. Full 
data are given, and the results tabulated. The table which is 
given below shows not only the weights of the calves, but also the 
solids contained in the milk taken, and the amount of milk taken 
by the calves of each series, in order to put on I kilo, of body- 
weight. 

Some of the experiments were carried out over a period of 
ten weeks and others over a period of fifteen weeks. 

Hittcher's table cannot be summarised ; it must be studied for 
itself in detail. He has arranged it so that there is an ascending 
series of figures under the heading of the amount of milk required 
to produce one kilogram of increase of body-weight. 

If this be taken as the main criterion of the nutritive value of 
any food-stuff, then the striking fact appears that the addition of 
salts is of much greater importance than the question as to whether the 
milk is given raw or boiled. It is difficult to assess the precise value 
of the figures in the other columns in comparing the results of each

series with one another. If the amount of milk required to pro- 
duce one kilogram increase in body-weight in Groups I and 2 
is considered, it is then seen that less boiled milk is required 
than raw milk ; that is, the boiled milk would appear to be more 
nutritious. 

Owing, however, to the paucity of data dealing with the amount 
of milk required to give an increase of one kilogram of body-weight, 
it has been necessary to take the gain in absolute weight, as the 
criterion of nutritive value. Upon this basis, if the Groups I 
and 2, and 7 and 3, be examined, then there appears to be some 



168 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

advantage in favour of the raw milk over the boiled milk of the 
same species. 

The age of the calf is shown to be of great importance in dealing 
with the nutritive value of the food. Thus a group of four calves 
which received raw milk and chalk required 9-01 kilos, of milk 
in order to put on i kilo, of body-weight in the first five weeks of 
life, and required 14*99 kilos, of milk for the same increase in 
body-weight on the second five weeks of life. 

If these two periods are taken together, then 12-08 kilos, of 
milk are required for I kilo, increase of body-weight. 

Another set of six calves which were fed upon boiled milk and 
chalk required 13-23 kilos, of milk during the first period of five 
weeks and 13-25 kilos, for the second period, in order to add I kilo, 
to their body-weight. 

The net results of both periods show a slight difference in 
favour of the raw milk, but Hittcher justly points out how great 
the error might have been in drawing deductions from either 
period taken alone. 

The table given by Hittcher, which is reproduced above in full, 
shows that the addition of salts is a more important factor than 
the actual boiling of the milk. The kilos, of milk are calculated 
from the values of total solids obtained by actual analysis, on the 
basis of milk containing 11-5 per cent, of solids. 

The salt content of the milk is evidently of great importance. 
If the addition of salts to mother's milk can bring about such 
striking differences, then that difference in salt content, which is 
known to exist between the milks of different species of animals, 
may reasonably be expected to play an important part in the 
nutritive value of the milk of a foreign species. 

Hittcher justly emphasises the importance of conducting experi- 
ments over a long period of time, and of estimating daily the solid 
value of the food taken, and not merely taking the weight of liquid 
milk given. 

A single experiment was made on boiled goat's milk as a food 
for kids by Briining in 1906. This will be considered with the 
experiments in Chap. X. 

It would appear that the salt content is of far greater 
importance than any effect which can be produced by boiling. 
Babick (1912) says that common salt should be added to the food 
of milking cows. If this is not done, he finds that at varying periods 
after commencement of lactation the cow shows signs of ill-health, 
loss of appetite, rough coat, loss of weight, and decreased milk 
supply. The more milk is given by the cow, the greater the effect 
produced. Common salt speedily restores the cow to health. 

Dammann (1912) carried out an experiment with raw milk and 
milk kept at 100 C. for an hour. Three calves were used ; (i) and 
(2) received the heated milk and (3) raw milk. The experiment 
extended over two months. During the first month only milk was

given ; during the second month hay and groats were added. All 
the calves put on weight, but calf (2) died suddenly of tympanitis. 
The results are shown in the following table :

No evidence of either rickets or Barlow's disease could be found 
in either (i) or (2). The author concludes that heating would 
not affect the milk. The evidence points to little if any loss of 
nutritive value of the milk being produced by boiling. 

Work by Grosser * suggests that the effect of heating milk may 
differ with the milk of different species. He shows that the salt 
content of human milk is more affected by heating than that of 
cows' milk.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER X 

EXPERIMENTAL DATA UPON THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF RAW AND 
BOILED MILK AS A FOOD FOR THE YOUNG OF DIFFERENT SPECIES 

THE utilisation of boiled milk, in contradistinction to raw milk, as 
a food for infants and young animals has formed the subject of 
much discussion and of a considerable amount of experimentation. 
The experiments have been conducted upon a variety of animals, 
and results have been obtained which aid in the general question 
of the feeding of infants. At the same time there are many 
difficulties connected with animal experimentation upon this 
subject, which must be afforded due consideration in forming 
an estimate of the value of the work carried out. 

Difficulties in Connection with Animal Experiments. Although 
it may appear that the simplest method of arriving at a satisfactory 
conclusion in regard to the nutritive value of boiled milk, as opposed 
to raw, would be by experimentation upon animals, certain circum- 
stances arise which markedly vitiate the value of such work. It 
has already been pointed out that the composition of milk of 
different species varies very greatly. Hence in the first place, in 
determining the animal to be used for the purpose of experi- 
mentation and the kind of milk which is to be given, the com- 
position of the milk should be considered so as to ensure, if 
possible, some degree of similarity of composition between the 
milk of the species itself and of the milk to be used for the 
purpose of feeding. 

Serious practical difficulties, however, occur in obtaining samples 
of the milk of certain species for use in feeding experiments. For 
instance, certain species are extremely difficult to milk. They 
appear to have the power to some extent of refusing to yield milk 
if they so wish. 

It has been shown in Chap. II that in order to obtain an average 
sample, especially an average fat sample, it is necessary that the 
gland should be completely emptied and an estimation made of 
the mixed sample. In the case of some animals this is impos- 
sible, so that the estimations are probably not accurate. Even 
if the precise composition were known it would be difficult to 

171 



172 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

find the milk of two species which is sufficiently similar in com- 
position for these differences not to require consideration. 

These differences in composition have led many people to believe 
that goats' milk, which is nearer in composition to that of human 
milk, should, theoretically speaking, be preferable for infants to 
cows' milk. 

Condition of Young Animals at Birth. The condition of young 
animals when born into the world varies within very wide limits. 
Some are born comparatively mature, while in others the striking 
feature is the immaturity of condition at birth. Guinea-pigs, for 
instance, are active almost at once after birth. During the first 
few hours they are found to be capable of eating almost anything 
that they can find in their cage. They receive mother's milk for 
a short time only, and at no period are they entirely dependent 
upon their mother. Throughout their existence, from birth on- 
wards, they take vegetable substances as well as mother's milk. 
On the other hand, such animals as kittens and rabbits are born 
in a condition in which they are entirely dependent upon their 
mother for care and for sustenance in the way of milk. Evidently 
the needs of organisms in such varied conditions of maturity must 
be different. 

It is to some extent irrelevant to compare, for instance, the 
nutritive value of raw and boiled cows' milk upon guinea-pigs with 
a view to ascertaining the value of this food for infants. 

Rate of Growth. The rate of growth of most young animals is 
much more rapid than that of the human infant. Adult life is 
reached more rapidly. Animals such as rats and mice are mature 
in a very few weeks from the time of their birth, and are capable of 
bringing families into the world within two or three months of 
their own birth. Compared with that of the human infant, who 
is dependent for its existence upon milk for a considerable number 
of months after birth, the development of these animals offers no 
parallel conditions. 

Additional Experimental Difficulties. Several additional experi- 
mental difficulties arise. It is well known that where only one 
or two animals can be secured for experiment, the margin of 
error is extremely great. Should one of them die, the experiment 
is practically valueless. It is not easy, however, to secure a large 
number of animals of exactly the same age. Hence many observers 
have been obliged either to work with an unduly small number of 
animals, or they have found it necessary to utilise animals whose 
ages, although roughly similar, were not identical. In animals 
whose dependence upon the mother for nutriment is reckoned 
only in days, evidently a few days or a week's difference of age 
may destroy the value of the experiment. 

These remarks show that too much reliance must not be placed 
upon animal experimentation when it is desired to obtain evidence 
relating to the nutritive value of food for infants. At the same 



EXPERIMENTAL DATA OF RAW AND BOILED MILK 173 

time, taken altogether, they may suffice to show sufficiently well 
the general nutritive value, and to serve as supporting evidence 
when taken in conjunction with clinical data. 

Of recent years experimentation on animals has practically 
ceased, but it is of interest to consider such work as has been accom- 
plished before proceeding with the clinical data. 

One advantage is undoubtedly presented by animal experi- 
mentation in connection with the present problem. Clinicians are 
very frequently predisposed in favour of raw or of boiled milk for 
their patients. In these circumstances they hesitate to employ 
any other variety of milk, since they only desire to utilise what 
they believe to be the best form of nourishment. In animal experi- 
mentation, however, it is possible to feed groups of animals over 
the same period upon both raw and boiled milk, and to compare the 
results obtained either with one another or with the results obtained 
by breast-feeding alone. Hence in the animal experiments it is usual 
to find the experiments carried out in two or three series worked 
simultaneously, whereas in the clinical work this is not the case. 

Experiments upon Guinea-pigs. In spite of the difficulties 
considered above in regard to the feeding of guinea-pigs with milk, 
a considerable number of experiments have been carried out. 
These experiments have added to our knowledge of desirable 
foods for guinea-pigs, and have incidentally offered some evidence 
in regard to utilisation of cows' milk for infants. There seems 
little doubt, however, that guinea-pigs cannot live on a milk diet 
only, the addition of vegetable substances being necessary. Only 
one observer has stated that he was able to keep guinea-pigs alive 
on milk alone, and his investigations have not been confirmed, 
nor have satisfactory data upon the subject been published. 

The most conclusive experiments have demonstrated the 
importance of breast-milk, even in the case of young guinea-pigs, 
who cannot live on milk only. 

As regards the use of raw or boiled cows' milk, no marked differ- 
ence in the nutritive value could be detected. As a whole, however, 
the boiled milk appeared to have given more favourable results 
than the raw milk. 

Experiments on Rats and Mice. Experiments were conducted 
by Keller on mice fed upon raw milk and upon boiled milk. Keller 
was unable to detect any difference in the nutritional condition of 
the sets of animals. 

Experiments were carried out by myself on rats, the animals 
being fed upon raw and boiled milk of the finest quality ; an 
additional series of rats were fed upon dried milk. These investi- 
gations are open to the objections which have already been pointed 
out generally in regard to animal experimentation. With this 
reservation, no difference could be detected between the raw and 
the boiled milk series, although some slight advantage appeared 
in those fed on dried milk. 



174 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

Experiments on Rabbits. These have been carried out by 
several observers, but young rabbits appear to thrive no better 
upon cows' milk than do young guinea-pigs. This is probably 
owing to the great difference in composition between rabbits' milk 
and cows' milk, as some reduction in the mortality was obtained 
when cream and sugar were added to the milk. 

Experiments on Dogs. A considerable amount of work has 
been carried out on puppies in order to ascertain any differences 
which may exist between the nutritive value of raw and boiled 
cows' milk. It appeared that in every instance the breast-fed 
puppies were very greatly superior to any of the artificially-fed 
ones at the end of the experiments, which lasted a considerable 
time in each case. As regards the series of artificially-fed animals, 
the gain in weight in relation to the food was either almost identical 
or showed a slightly higher figure for the dogs fed on boiled cows' 
milk. 

Experiments on Kittens. Comparatively little work has been 
carried out upon kittens. Although the kitten, when it reaches the 
age when it can leave its mother, appears to be able to utilise cows' 
milk very readily, it would seem that until this period has been 
reached cows' milk, whether raw or boiled, is not a suitable food 
for kittens. Most of the animals upon which these experiments 
were carried out either died or apparently would have died, had 
the experiments been continued. 

Experiments on Pigs. Here also a good deal of work has been 
carried out. Speaking generally, the results are very similar to 
those obtained by experimentation on puppies. In every case 
the breast-fed pigs were superior to the artificially-fed ones, not 
only during the experiment, but also later, when the experiment 
had ceased for some considerable time. The milk used for the 
artificially-fed pigs was of the highest quality, but two pigs were 
fed on market milk, in one case raw and in the other boiled. It 
appeared that in the pigs fed on the best milk, a slight superiority 
was noticed in the raw milk as against the boiled milk. In the 
pigs fed on market milk, however, the reverse was the case. 

Experiments on Goats. Briming and Briickler both fed kids 
upon raw and boiled cows' milk. The small number of animals 
available reduces somewhat the value of the experiment ; as, how- 
ever, they show the same general features as those just considered, 
they afford useful corroborative evidence. 

General Summary. Summarising the results of work upon 
animals, the superiority of breast-feeding may be regarded as the 
most striking feature. In regard to artificial feeding, very little 
difference, if any, appears to be detected between the different 
forms of milk that is, raw or boiled. In some instances the boiled 
milk appears to be better utilised than the raw, while in one or two 
cases the reverse is found to be the case. Generally, however, no 
marked difference was shown.

CHAPTER X 

EXPERIMENTAL DATA UPON THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF RAW AND 
BOILED MILK AS A FOOD FOR THE YOUNG OF A DIFFERENT SPECIES 

DETAILS of the numerous experiments which have been carried out 
upon animals in order to ascertain the relative nutritive values 
of raw and boiled cows' milk are given below. General criticisms 
on this class of work have already been made in the summary on 
this chapter and need not be repeated. 

Experiments upon Guinea-pigs. The first experiments carried 
out upon guinea-pigs were those of Bolle. Bolle (1903) was led to 
carry out his experiments as the result of seeing a case of Barlow's 
disease in a child, which he attributed to the sterilised milk upon 
which the child had been fed. 

This observer fed young guinea-pigs upon cows' milk which 
had been boiled for five, ten, fifteen minutes, and longer. He 
found that only the guinea-pigs who were fed upon the milk which 
had been boiled for five minutes did well ; all the others died in 
periods varying inversely with the length of time for which the 
milk had been boiled. These results were sharply criticised by 
Bartenstein, who, on the publication of Bolle's results, had com- 
menced experiments upon the same lines. 

Bartenstein (1905) fed numerous young guinea-pigs upon raw, 
boiled, and sterilised cows' milk. They all died. He then varied 
the diet by adding to it small quantities of sterilised hay, but the 
animals refused the hay, and all died. Bartenstein then applied 
to Bolle for details in regard to the feeding. Bolle replied that 
the feeding had been supervised by another observer, who was no 
longer available for information ; that there had been a little 
difficulty in getting the animals to feed at first, but that it had been 
overcome by giving cream. No observer has confirmed Bolle's 
results, and not much stress can be laid upon them. 

Briining (3) (1906) fed guinea-pigs upon raw and boiled cows' 
milk, using breast-fed guinea-pigs as controls. Profiting by 
Bartenstein's experience, he allowed all the animals small quantities 
of hay every day. All the animals lived. The controls did best 
of all, next came the animal fed upon boiled cows' milk, and then 
the one fed upon raw cows' milk. The coats of the artificially-fed 
ones were not in good condition. Only one animal was used 
for each of the series, and the possibility of error is therefore very 
great. 

Moro (1907) fed considerable numbers of guinea-pigs upon 
human milk, and on cows' milk, both raw and boiled. All the 
guinea-pigs died in a few days, with acute symptoms suggestive 






I 7 6 



MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



of alimentary intoxication. Post-mortem examination gave no 
evidence as to the cause of death. Later, Moro succeeded in 
keeping guinea-pigs alive who were taken away from their mother 
immediately after birth, but were given a low vegetable diet. He 
then allowed the young ones to have mother's milk for periods of 
o, i, 3, 5. 7 days, and so on. The young guinea-pigs were then 
isolated and given a vegetable diet. Of those taken away 
immediately after birth 80 per cent, died, of those left one day 
30 per cent, died, of those left three days only 10 per cent, died, and 
of those left for longer periods all lived.

DIAGRAM 7. Showing the value of breast-feeding for young guinea-pigs. 

The weight-curve of those deprived entirely of mothers' milk is represented 
by crosses. 

Diagram 7. It should be noted that the result showed a progressive 
improvement with the length of time they were allowed to be with 
their mother, the superiority of the curve persisting up to the 
sixtieth day of life, when the experiment was discontinued. 

These experiments show that guinea-pigs will not live upon a 
cows' milk diet alone, but that they must have vegetable food. 
I can also personally confirm this fact, from some experiments 
carried out by me at the Lister Institute in 1908. (Unpublished.) 

Some experiments were carried out by Schroeder on guinea- 
pigs bred under his own supervision. It was not possible to obtain 
a sufficient quantity of young guinea-pigs at the same date, and 
the experiments ranged over ten months, during which time some 



EXPERIMENTAL DATA OF RAW AND BOILED MILK 177 

467 guinea-pigs were fed from birth onwards on various forms of 
cows' milk, and 156 were left with their mother and thus received 
their natural food. Guinea-pigs were selected for the purpose of 
experiment as being to some degree analogous with calves, that 
is to say, both species are herbivorous, and in both cases the young 
are dependent for a comparatively short period upon their mother's 
milk as sole food. 

The guinea-pigs were not fed exclusively on milk but were 
allowed other forms of food, the nature of which is not specified. 

As the litters of young pigs were born they were separated 
into various groups, being divided equally as far as possible. No 
weakty ones were placed in the groups used for artificial feeding, 
these being all left with their mothers and forming part of the 
series of pigs dealt with for the natural-feeding controls. The 
guinea-pigs on artificial food were divided into three groups : 
(a) Those fed on raw milk, (b) on pasteurised milk (heated to 140 F. 
for twenty minutes and then rapidly cooled), and (c) on boiled milk. 
(The boiled milk was slowly heated to boiling-point, kept at that 
temperature for one minute and then rapidly cooled.) A special 
apparatus was devised by which I c.c. of milk was fed to each 
guinea-pig five times a day. After the twentieth day milk was 
accessible to the pigs for ten days longer, after which it was 
withdrawn from their diet. The milk used for the purpose was 
of the best quality, obtained from the experiment station and 
from tuberculin-tested cows, and in no case was it more than eight 
hours old when fed to the pigs. 

The effect of feeding with the three kinds of milk was measured 
(a) by the mortality among the experimental animals and (b) by 
the average weight at different periods of the surviving animals. 
Schroeder gives the following table :

Schroeder emphasises the great superiority of mother's milk 
over that of any form of cows' milk for the young guinea-pigs, 
more especially as the weakly ones were always left with their 
mothers. This last fact accentuates the marked difference between 
the two groups. As regards the artificially fed groups he points 



i 7 8 



MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



out that the results are in favour of the boiled milk. The mortality 
rate can be further gauged by comparing the number of animals 
used with those which died.

Schroeder points out that the favourable results obtained with 
the boiled milk were obtained with milk of a superlative quality. 
Those animals which died, died mainly from inflammation of the 
stomach and bowels, and of pneumonia. In some cases no lesions 
were discovered to account satisfactorily for death. The average 
weight of the guinea-pigs at different ages is also given and is here

Here again in the artificially-fed groups the more favourable 
results were obtained with boiled milk. 

Experiments on Mice. In 1904 Keller published some experi- 
ments on mice. Like those of Bartenstein on guinea-pigs, they 
were carried out as a result of Bulle's work, and were conducted 
by him personally or under his immediate supervision 

The mice were fed upon raw milk, upon milk just boiled, and 
upon milk which had been boiled for two hours. He found no 



EXPERIMENTAL DATA OF RAW AND BOILED MILK 179 

difference between the mice of the different batches. Some digestive 
disturbances were present, but these were obviated by preventing 
the contamination of the food by faeces. 

Experiments on Rats. Some experiments were carried out by 
myself on rats, but the animals, though young, were no longer of 
an age when suckling is necessary. The rats were fed in batches 
of one dozen upon raw, boiled, and dried milk, and a little bread. 
In one series those fed upon dried milk showed a slightly more 
rapid gain in weight than those fed upon boiled milk, and these 
again a rather more rapid gain than those fed upon raw milk. In 
two other series fed upon raw and boiled milk respectively, no 
difference could be detected between the rats of either series. 

In making any deductions from these experiments bearing on 
the feeding of infants the sources of fallacy are, that the rats were 
no longer of suckling age, and that they received bread as well as 
milk. As, however, all the batches received the same percentage 
of milk and bread per kilo, of body-weight, it may reasonably be 
inferred from these experiments that rats just past the suckling 
age are able to utilise dried and boiled milk fully as well as raw milk. 

Experiments on Rabbits. It appears that rabbits are scarcely 
suitable animals for the purposes of such experiments, nor are 
they at all easy to use. 

It is difficult to get young rabbits to drink out of a bottle ; also 
rabbits' milk is much richer in fat than cows' milk and thus com- 
plications are introduced as to the amount of food required to 
supplement mother's milk. 

Briining (3) (1906) carried out some experiments on young 
rabbits five days old. One rabbit of the litter was left with its 
mother, another was given raw cows' milk with the addition of 
cream, and the other boiled cows' milk, also with the addition of 
cream. The rabbit fed upon raw milk died upon the eleventh 
day of the experiment, and the one fed upon boiled cows' milk 
was in a greatly inferior condition to the one left with its mother. 
No comparisons are possible between the effects of the raw and 
boiled cows' milk since one of the animals died. 

Moro (1907) fed young rabbits upon both human and cows' 
milk, raw and boiled. Nearly all the animals died, in spite of the 
fact that they took the food well. If they were allowed mixed 
feeding of rabbits' milk and cows' milk they rarely showed any 
untoward symptoms, and if these occurred the attack was warded 
off by stopping the cows' milk and giving only mother's milk. 
The addition of cream and sugar to the cows' milk gave better 
results and the animals lived longer. It seems, therefore, that 
young rabbits do not thrive either on raw or boiled cows' milk or 
human milk, and hence are hardly suitable for making deductions as 
to the relative nutritive value of raw and boiled cows' milk as 
a food for infants. 

Experiments on Dogs. A considerable number of experiments 

N 2 



i8o MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

have been carried out upon dogs, and cows' milk seems to be a 
suitable food for this species. 

Rodet (1896) took six puppies four of one litter (dogs 1-4) 
aged from five to six weeks old, one of another litter of the same 
age (dog 5), and another rather older (dog 6). 

Puppies i and 2 were fed upon raw cows' milk. 
Puppies 3 and 4 were fed upon cows' milk, just boiled. 
Puppy 5 was fed upon cows' milk subjected to prolonged 

boiling. 
Puppy 6 was fed upon cows' milk just boiled, as for puppies 

3 and 4. 

As regards weight, the balance was distinctly in favour of the 
boiled cows' milk, the increase in weight at the end of thirty- 
one days, when the experiment was terminated, being in the pro- 
portion of 

638 for dogs i and 2, 
796 for dogs 3 and 4, 
276 for dog 5, 
525 for dog 6. 

Dogs 5 and 6 were receiving rather less milk per kilo, of body- 
weight than dogs 1-4. 

_ . . increase of weight . 

Taking the quotient -T-TJ 7 -r 2 he found the value to be 

62 for dogs i and 2, 
68 for dogs 3 and 4, 
61 for dog 5, 
62 for dog 6. 

Thus there was a better utilisation of the boiled cows' milk 
than of the raw. 

Keller (1904) fed two young dogs upon sterilised and boiled 
cows' milk respectively and found no difference between the two 
dogs even after three months. 

Bruning (i) (1904) carried out two sets of experiments upon 
dogs. 

In the first series he had six puppies (hounds), of which two 
were left at the breast, one was fed upon raw cows' milk, and another 
upon boiled ; the two remaining puppies received raw and boiled 
goats' milk respectively. The puppy fed upon raw cows' milk 
died on the fourth day of the experiment of inhalation pneumonia, 
providing another example of the drawback of an insufficient 
number of animals in an experimental series. 

The breast-fed puppies did incomparably better than any of the 
others. Then came the one fed upon boiled cows' milk, and then 
those fed upon boiled and raw goats' milk respectively. 



EXPERIMENTAL DATA OF RAW AND BOILED MILK 181 

The average gain for the breast-fed puppies was 113-121 
grammes per day ; for the boiled cows' milk puppy 48-2 grammes 
per day ; for the boiled goats' milk puppy 457 grammes per 
day ; and for the raw goats' milk puppy 38-4 grammes per day. 

In the second series four puppies were taken from birth. Two 
were fed upon the breast, the third on raw, and the fourth on 
boiled, cows' milk. 

Here again the breast-fed puppies did incomparably better 
than the others. 

The experiment lasted seventy-five days, and during this time 

Puppy i on the breast had increased in weight from 165 to 

2864 grammes ; a gain of 2699 grammes. 
Puppy 2 on the breast had increased in weight from 205 to 

2215 grammes ; a gain of 2010 grammes. 
Puppy 3 on raw cows' milk increased in weight from 299 to 

1105 grammes ; a gain of 806 grammes. 
Puppy 4 on boiled cows' milk increased in weight from 

238 to 1785 grammes ; a gain of 1547 grammes. 

Puppy 3 had the breast for six days and weighed 299 grammes 
when the raw milk was started. The puppy fed upon raw cows' 
milk showed what appeared to be evidence of rickets and was 
chloroformed and examined post-mortem. No evidence of rickets 
could, however, be found either macro- or microscopically. 

The coats of the breast-fed dogs were on the whole smoother 
than those of the artificially fed dogs. 

Peer's ' Quotient of Increase ' * (which is represented by

kilos. of milk taken / 

ally-fed dogs of this series, and was found to be 118 for the dog 
fed upon raw cows' milk and 119 for the dog fed upon boiled 
cows' milk. 

In both the series all the surviving animals developed into very 
good dogs. 

It appears, therefore, that cows' milk can act as a substitute 
for mother's milk in dogs, and that the dogs thrive better if the 
milk is given boiled. 

The breast-fed dogs remained, however, greatly superior to the 
artificially-fed ones. 

Moro (1907) showed that dogs fed upon human milk remained 
alive but were in a very miserable condition, whereas dogs upon 
cows' milk did extremely well. These results, taken in conjunction 
with the results obtained by the same observer on rabbits, show 
that in deducing results from experiments it is very important 
to use a species of animal whose milk is suitable for the other species 

1 For details see Jahrb.f. Kinderh. 1902, Ivi. 421. 



i82 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

whose growth is being investigated. The milk of one species of 
mammal is by no means always suitable for the young of another 
species. This appears again in the experiments upon kittens, which 
will be described immediately. 

Experiments on Battens. Chamouin (1892) took kittens thirty 
to forty days old, and fed them on raw and boiled cows' milk, three 
kittens on each kind of milk. There was also a control breast-fed 
kitten. The experiment lasted twelve days. The control kitten 
put on 560 grammes in weight. The kittens fed on raw cows' milk 
put on 172 grammes, and the kittens fed upon boiled cows' milk 
put on 349 grammes each. It seems, however, that the artificially- 
fed kittens were not in a good state of health, and that not im- 
probably had the experiment lasted much longer the artificially- 
fed kittens would have died. 

From some work carried out by Grunbaum for the Local Govern- 
ment Board (referred to in the Annual Report of the Medical 
Officer to the Board for 1906), it seems fairly evident that cows' 
milk is not a suitable substitute for mother's milk for kittens, 
until they have reached an age when mother's milk is no longer 
necessary. 

Vincent (1911) has carried out some experiments upon kittens. 
These experiments as such do not come within the scope of this 
report ; but since he deduces from them that boiled milk is harmful 
for babies, brief mention must be made of them. 

The kittens taken were of the age of two months, and the feeding 
was carried out by the animal attendant. Milk was brought from 
the Infants' Hospital, and after the milk had been raised to 200 F. 
it was incubated for twenty-four hours at 85 F. In most of the 
series the milk, after heating, was inoculated with special organisms, 
the action of which it was desired to study. 

No kittens appear to have been fed upon raw milk to act as 
control animals to those fed upon this form of milk, but it is stated 
that the infants in the hospital who were fed upon raw milk acted 
as controls to the kittens fed on other forms of milk at the Lister 
Institute. 

All the kittens fed upon these foods died. It is clear that no 
kitten was fed upon boiled milk as ordinarily meant by the term, 
since even where there had been no inoculation of the milk, it 
was incubated for twenty-four hours before administration and 
therefore not comparable with milk which, in accordance with usual 
practice, is boiled and used very shortly afterwards. 

None of the experiments on kittens seem to have given results 
upon which any reasonable deductions can be based in regard to 
the relative nutritive value of raw and boiled cows' milk as a food 
for either infants or kittens. 

Experiments on Pigs. Bruning (3) carried out experiments 
upon young pigs. 

The litter used consisted of seven pigs. Pigs A, B, C were

left with their mother, but were only allowed to feed at stated 
intervals, and were weighed before and after each feed, so that the 
total quantity of milk taken was known. Pigs D and E were 
fed upon boiled cows' milk, and pigs F and G upon raw cows' 
milk. 

The initial weights of the pigs varied from 912-1365 grammes. 
The supply of mother's milk was poor, and the breast-fed pigs 
obtained a much smaller quantity of milk than the artificially fed 
pigs. All ate well and put on weight well. 

No appreciable difference could be detected between the different 
pigs D and E, and F and G, but the artificially fed pigs doubled 
their weight rather sooner than the breast-fed ones, possibly owing 
to the shortage of food supply in the latter case. 

Feer's quotient (increase per kilo, of body-weight 4- kilos, of 
milk taken) gave a value of 165 for the breast-fed pigs, of 65 for 
the pigs fed upon boiled cows' milk, and of 60 for those fed upon 
raw cows' milk. 

Mother's milk is therefore very much better utilised by pigs 
than cows' milk, and boiled cows' milk rather better than raw. 

Bamberg (1910), realising that in all the experiments which 
had been carried out so far, ordinary impure market milk had been 
used, undertook some experiments upon pigs in which he used the 
purest milk obtainable in Berlin. The bacterial content of the 
milk was taken and the milk was found to be almost germ-free 
throughout the experiment. 

The milk was obtained from the Viktoria Park Dairy. 

A litter of eight pigs was taken immediately after birth. 

Of these pigs 

A and B were fed upon raw cows' milk from the 

Viktoria Park Dairy. 
C and D were fed upon boiled cows' milk from the 

Viktoria Park Dairy. 

E was fed upon raw cows' milk (market milk). 
F was fed upon boiled cows' milk (market milk). 
G and H were fed upon the breast. 

Pigs G and H doubled their weight on the I4th day. 

A B I7th day. 

Pig F doubled its weight on the igth day. 

C 20th day. 

D 23rd day. 

., E 32nd day. 

Pigs C and D did not seem quite so happy as A and B. 

As regards weight, therefore, the pigs fed upon raw germ-free 
milk did rather better than those fed upon the same milk boiled. 
But the pig fed upon boiled market milk did very considerably 
better than the one fed upon raw market milk.

As a whole, therefore, pigs A and B utilised their food rather 
better than pigs C and D. But pig F utilised its food better than 
pig E. 

After seven weeks the pigs were returned to their owner, who 
reported later on that the artificially fed pigs were all inferior to 
the breast-fed pigs, but that no difference could be detected between 
the different artificially-fed pigs. 

Klein carried out feeding experiments upon fourteen little pigs 
about seven weeks old. The pigs were divided into three groups 
as follows : 

Group I. Four pigs fed upon raw skim milk, potatoes, and 

barley-bran. 
Group II. Five pigs fed upon pasteurised skim milk, 

potatoes, and barley-bran. 
Group III. Five pigs fed upon raw skimmed milk, potatoes, 

barley-bran, and dried yeast. 

The milk was gradually replaced by the yeast in Group III, 
but the animals refused it after a while, and did not do so well as 
in Group I. 

No difference could be detected between Groups I and II except 
that there was a slight balance in favour of the group which had 
received the pasteurised milk.

Experiments on Goats. Briining (2, 3) carried out two sets 
of experiments on goats, which are, however, really supplementary 
the one to the other and can be taken together. Each litter had 
consisted of three kids. These were fed as follows : 

First Litter 

Kid i. Breast-fed. 

Kid 2. Boiled mother's milk. 

Kid 3. Boiled cows' milk. 

Second Litter 

Kid 4. Breast-fed. 

Kid 5. Breast twice a day and other feeds raw cows' milk. 

Kid 6. Raw cows' milk. 

Kid i. Douoled its weight on the fifteenth day. The value 

for Peer's quotient was 50-2. 
Kid 4. Doubled its weight on the sixteenth day. The value 

for Peer's quotient was 53-1. 
Kid 2. Doubled its weight on the twenty-second day. The 

value for Peer's quotient was 28-4. 
Kid 5. Doubled its weight on the twenty-second day. The 

value for Peer's quotient was 25-0. 
Kid 3. Doubled its weight on the twentieth day. The value 

for Peer's quotient was 24-0. 
Kid 6. Doubled its weight on the twenty-fifth day. The 

value for Peer's quotient was 21*0. 

The initial weights of the animals were very different, so that 
some of them had put on considerably more weight than the others. 
Peer's quotient shows the nutritional value of the food, although 
it does not show the caloric value of the food taken. 

These experiments bring out the great superiority of mother's 
milk over that of cows' milk as a food for kids. They also show 
slight superiority of boiled cows' milk over raw. 

Briickler (1907) carried out an experiment on goats on identical 
lines to those of Briining. Two litters were used, and two goats, 
for each method of feeding. The milk given was collected with 
all possible precautions, and was as far as possible germ-free. 
Briickler obtained a rather more rapid increase in weight with the 
raw cows' milk than Briining did, but Peer's quotient was higher 
with the boiled cows' milk than with the raw. 

Goats seem therefore to do fairly well on cows' milk, but 
the results are very inferior to those obtained with mother's 
milk. 

If cows' milk be given there is a slight advantage in giving it 
boiled. 

Although experimentation upon animals in order to deter- 
mine the nutritive properties of raw and boiled milk of foreign 



i86 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

species cannot altogether be regarded as satisfactory, the results 
show : 

(a) The great superiority of breast-feeding over any form 
of artificial feeding employed. 

(b) That where series of animals were fed simultaneously over 
fairly prolonged periods on raw and boiled cows' milk respectively, 
no essential difference in nutritive value between the two forms of 
food could be detected. In some cases the boiled milk gave 
distinctly better results than raw milk, whereas in isolated cases 
the reverse was found. 

(c) In considering the nutritive value it is not sufficient to 
ccnsider merely the gain in weight, but the gain in relation to the 
amount of food taken should also be considered. This, however, 
does not alter the general trend of the remarks made above.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER XI 

CLINICAL DATA ON THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF RAW AND BOILED 
COWS' MILK AS A FOOD FOR INFANTS 

IT is difficult to obtain the necessary data for an accurate con- 
sideration of the subject of this chapter, from the records of hospitals 
for sick children. Until recently, however, this was the only 
means available. The hospital patient is hardly suitable for the 
purpose of investigating the nutritive properties of any special 
food. The sick child is liable to react, and probably does react, 
differently from the normal child to a large number of food-stuffs. 
Sick children are not here under consideration, but rather the 
average, reasonably healthy infant. If hospital cases alone are 
considered, therefore, there will be a tendency to error which cannot 
be regarded as negligible. Moreover, hospital cases are naturally 
unsuited for a prolonged investigation of the nutritive value of 
any kind of food. At the time of admission they are for the most 
part in a pathological state and require special measures in order 
to enable them to improve. As soon as such improvement has 
begun, it is more than probable that the physician considers it 
desirable to alter the dietary of the child. This, although clearly 
necessary as a curative measure, cannot be regarded as other 
than an impairment of the data from the experimental point of 
view. In addition to the probability of the dietary being altered 
every few days, the child is sent back to its home, and away from 
skilled observation, at the earliest possible moment. 

Consequently observations made in hospitals upon the nutritive 
value of raw and boiled milk for infants have for the most part 
been confined to pathological cases, and have extended over 
short periods only. It is not possible to deduce from them what 
the ultimate effect upon the child of either method of feeding 
may be. 

One defect of observations carried out in hospitals has already 
been briefly alluded to in the preceding chapter. It was there 
pointed out that physicians tend to use one form of feeding for the 
majority of their cases who are in a reasonably healthy condition. 
This will vary according to the individual predilection of the 

187 



1 88 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

physician. As a result, control observations in regard to other 
methods of feeding are usually absent. 

The published investigations show that a good many children 
appear to improve rapidly upon raw milk, while an equal number 
appear to improve equally well upon boiled milk. 

A few experiments have been carried out in other countries upon 
children in institutions, who could be observed for longer periods. 
The most comprehensive experiments were carried out by Finkel- 
stein, who observed a number of children, both healthy and sick, 
over considerable periods. Children of both classes were fed upon 
raw and boiled milk. The milk used was of the best quality, and was 
used for all the children, whether fed upon raw or upon boiled 
milk. No definite superiority of one method of feeding was 
established, but there was perhaps a slight balance in favour of 
the boiled milk. 

The work of Park and Holt in New York has shown that even 
when reasonable precautions are taken and when good milk is 
supplied, it is safer to heat the milk used for the infants. Their 
special investigations upon some ninety infants gave results which 
were distinctly unfavourable to raw milk. 

In all work where the results likely to be obtained from feeding 
infants on any form of milk are analysed, it is necessary to consider 
not only the possible original contamination of the milk, but also 
the possibility (or rather, the probability) of contamination in the 
home of even an ideal milk supply. 

The material which had been collected in one of the infant 
consultations in Berlin was kindly placed at my disposal in 1911 ; 
and I was enabled to analyse the medical notes of 300 breast-fed 
babies, and of 204 infants fed on good milk, which was boiled in 
the homes. This does not give a comparison of the value of raw 
and boiled milk. The results obtained with the boiled milk were, 
however, so favourable as to render it unlikely that any form of 
artificial feeding would have produced more favourable results, 
especially in view of the experience derived from previous investi- 
gations on these lines. 

Generally, it may be stated that no form of artificial feeding 
will produce results of as favourable a nature as are obtained by 
natural methods of feeding. Where artificial feeding must be 
employed, there is no evidence that milk loses any of its nutritive 
value by boiling. The work of numerous observers indicates 
that rather more satisfactory progress is made with boiled than 
with raw milk. 

These remarks apply to the general infant population, and not 
to special infants in pathological conditions. In these latter cases 
idiosyncrasies for special forms of food are frequently exhibited.

CHAPTER XI 

CLINICAL DATA ON THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF RAW AND BOILED 
COWS' MILK AS A FOOD FOR INFANTS 

THE general considerations arising in regard to the value of the 
clinical data available as a result of the feeding of hospital infants 
is considered in the summary of this chapter. It is necessary, 
however, to give a somewhat detailed account of the individual 
observations which have been made by various investigators. 

The earliest published work appears to be that of Uhlig, who 
in 1891 quoted thirty-nine cases of children suffering from various 
degrees of mal-nutrition, who all did well on sterilised milk. No 
control cases were taken. 

In the same year Leeds and Davis published an account of 
the results of feeding sick children all apparently suffering from 
diarrhoea on sterilised milk. The results were stated to be un- 
satisfactory, some of the children dying from apparent starvation. 
No improvement followed the peptonising of the milk. Marked 
improvement occurred in such children as received a few breast- 
feeds in the day, together with the sterilised milk. No controls 
seem to have been carried out with either raw or pasteurised milk. 
The milk used was sterilised for half an hour. 

Much stress cannot be laid upon these results, since there were 
no controls, although Davis states that he has seen children who 
were not improving on sterilised milk do well upon raw. 

Variot (1898) at a meeting in Paris quoted thirty cases of 
atrophic children who had attended his consultation at Belleville, 
and who had all done very well when fed upon sterilised milk. 
He gave no control cases. 

Palmer (1900) described the satisfactory results which he had 
obtained in America with raw milk, and advocated its use. He 
gives no control cases fed upon boiled milk, and, moreover, had 
the great advantage of the large ice supply of American cities. 
No actual data are given. 

Monrad (1902) published six cases of atrophic and dyspeptic 
children who had improved when fed upon raw milk. He considers 
that only certain cases need raw milk. No controls fed upon boiled 
milk are mentioned. 

Czerny (1902) at the Breslauer Klinik fed atrophic children 
upon both raw and boiled goats' milk, the goats being kept upon 
the premises. He was unable to detect any appreciable difference 
between the children fed upon raw and boiled goats' milk , both 
sets were very constipated, those fed upon raw milk rather more 
so than those fed upon boiled milk. The improvement in all cases 
was very inferior to that which usually occurs when similar cases 
receive mother's milk. 



190 



MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



Halipre" (1904) quotes the case of a child whose weight was 
increasing at the rate of 7 grammes per day while fed upon sterilised 
milk. When given raw milk the increase rose to a rate of 30 
grammes per day. He states that he has seen other similar cases. 
The period of sterilisation of the milk is not given. 

Hohlfield (1905) published eight cases of children suffering 
from various stages of mal-nutrition who were fed for the most 
part upon raw milk ; some, however, received raw milk alternately 
with boiled milk over periods of about one month. All the children 
were ill, some of them severely so. Three had only raw milk, two 
vomited boiled milk, and another put on more weight on raw milk 
than on boiled milk. The remaining two were twins, of whom 
the sicklier child was put upon raw milk, and the healthier one had 
boiled milk. The sicklier one did better than the healthier one. 

These data certainly seem to show that there are cases of sick 
children where raw milk gives better results than boiled milk ; at 
the same time the evidence already given shows that many children 
who are suffering from mal-nutrition do extremely well upon 
boiled milk. It would not appear to be justifiable to draw con- 
clusions in regard to the relative nutritive properties of raw and 
boiled milk in the treatment of healthy babies, as a result of 
Hohlfield's experiments, where only four babies were given boiled 
milk, and of those, two had an apparent idiosyncrasy against boiled 
milk and vomited it after administration. 

Vincent (1906) has published twenty cases of markedly severe 
mal-nutrition in infants which were fed upon raw milk and did 
very well. These cases were fed upon the percentage method of 
feeding, under constant supervision, and often of change of the 
percentage of ingredients. No case was fed upon boiled milk of 
a similar percentage mixture. 

Extensive observations were carried out by Finkelstein which 
are difficult to summarise, and the results are best seen by repro- 
ducing Finkelstein's tables. He classified the cases into three groups, 
as below, where the results obtained in each group are shown.

apparent signs of disease ; under eight weeks of age, and having

Finkelstein concludes that ' no definite distinction between the 
results obtained by feeding upon raw and boiled milk respectively, 
could be detected.' If these figures of Finkelstein's are examined 
a little further, it is seen that in Group I (A) there is a balance in 
favour of the boiled milk, whereas in the other groups there is a 
balance which is slightly in favour of the raw milk. 

Plantenga (1910) treated children with digestive troubles with 
both raw and boiled milk, and from a study of the weight-curves 
was unable to find any evidence of the superiority of either method 
of feeding, over the other. 

Park and Holt, in the course of a most valuable investigation, 
carried out in New York upon the feeding of infants in tenement 
dwellings, made special observations upon approximately equal 
groups of infants fed upon raw and pasteurised milk. The 
inquiry lasted over the summers of two successive years, being 
commenced each year at the beginning of June and lasting 
till the end of the summer, and the results are given in the 
table below. The milk was used modified for both groups and

counted in the milk was 45,000 per c.c. and in the cream

of bacteria in the raw milk was 1,200,000 per c.c. and in the 
pasteurised about 1000. Investigations of the bacterial content 
carried out later in the same days from similar bottles showed 
counts respectively of 20,000,000 and 50,000 per c.c. Of the 
fifty-one children who were fed on raw milk, thirteen had to be 
transferred before the end of the period of observation to pasteurised 
milk, on account of attacks of diarrhoea which supervened. The 
figures given are not favourable to raw milk, and the physicians 
who carried out the investigations believed that the comparative 
results would have been still less favourable had these thirteen 
children all been kept upon the raw milk. 

The children were taken off milk when an attack of diarrhoea 
supervened. 

Variot and Lorenz-Monod carried out some observations upon 
children fed upon raw milk. 1 The milk was obtained from a large 
dairy and from tuberculin-tested cows. It was delivered packed 
in ice and saw-dust and was kept cold until use. Bacteriologically 
it was sterile, and was chemically of very good quality. Eighteen 
children were fed upon pure raw milk and of these cases five died. 
Three did well and remained well for the whole period. Several 
had serious intestinal trouble, when it was necessary to replace 
the raw milk by Lepelletier's milk or by condensed milk. The 
children were grouped under headings according to their ages.

Variot noticed that the stools were particularly offensive in 
many of the cases, and bacteriological examination showed a 
preponderance of organisms of the coli type. The children did 
well when the diet was altered to other foods. 

The experiments described above do not carry the observa- 
tions over a sufficiently prolonged period, nor is the number of 
children sufficient for deductions to be made from them for the 
general infant population. In 1911 I was commissioned by the 
Local Government Board to carry out investigations on a large 
scale, using healthy infants or reasonably healthy infants only. 

Of late years the rise of infant consultations, where healthy

but it is more convenient to consider it before taking the Berlin material. 



194 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

children are kept at regular intervals under medical supervision, 
accompanied by home visitation by trained women visitors, has 
afforded opportunity for observations upon healthy children which 
had hitherto not existed. 

The largest infant consultations existing at that time were to 
be found in Berlin. These consultations, which are maintained 
by the municipality, had been established for a number of years, 
and the amount of material accumulated in their archives was 
immense. So far, however, no results of the medical supervision 
had been published. The infants attending these consultations 
were for the most part breast-fed, this form of feeding being 
naturally encouraged as much as possible by the medical officers 
to the consultation. Children for whom artificial feeding was 
required were fed upon boiled cows' milk supplied in connection 
with the consultation. The milk was produced on the Berlin 
municipal farm with adequate precautions to ensure the clean- 
liness of the milk, and was delivered cooled at a number of centres 
in the city. Mothers attending the infant consultations were 
entitled to obtain the milk from these centres at a reduced rate, 
if this was necessary. They were instructed to bring the milk just 
up to the boil in their own houses, to set it aside in a cool place, 
and to prepare it for the infant as directed by the doctor of 
the consultation. In order to ensure that this method of pro- 
cedure was carried out, a sufficient staff of trained health visitors 
was available from the centre, the homes being visited at least 
every ten days. 

The drawback for this investigation was the absence of children 
fed upon raw cows' milk. Enquiry in a number of quarters 
showed that there was no infant consultation of sufficient size to 
afford the necessary material available from which to draw for 
data, in connection with the nutritive value of raw cows' milk. 1 

Material used for the Investigation. For the purpose of com- 
paring the progress made by infants when breast-fed or when fed 
upon cows' milk, it was determined to secure at least two hundred 
infants for each series, utilising as far as possible similar numbers 
of infants in the same year in order to eliminate as far as possible 
climatic influences. The mortality among the infants at the 
consultation was extremely low in the years from which the material 
was taken, and careful calculation showed that the mortality 
factor could be neglected altogether in the material investigated. 

Children specifically stated in the notes to be suffering from some 
congenital defect or disease were not admitted into the series. No 
child who was older than four months at the time of its first attend- 
ance was considered, and the very great majority of cases in both 

1 Raw cows' milk is used for the feeding of artificially fed infants in 
Belfast, but the material has not been worked up, and at the time the in- 
vestigation here being considered was made, the material was not sufficient 
for the purpose.

series attended the infant consultation from about the tenth day 
of life onwards, up to the end of the first year and even later. 

Infants coming into the breast-fed series had all been breast-fed 
for at least four months after birth. Comparatively few had been 
fed for as short a period as this, and the great proportion of them 
had received natural food for from six to nine months. At this 
latter age weaning was carried out by the recommendation of the 
medical officer to the consultation. Three hundred such cases 
were taken for investigation. 

Of the artificially fed babies the majority had been artificially 
fed from birth or from about the first week after birth, only a few 
having received the breast for some weeks ; two hundred and four 
cases were taken. Detailed figures relating to, both series are 
given in Appendix D. 

These babies were brought up for weighing regularly, usually 
at intervals of ten days, sometimes at fortnightly intervals. The 
weight was recorded on each occasion, and the child was seen by the 
medical officer. The method of feeding was prescribed by the 
doctor, and noted on the medical record. Observations in regard 
to the child's progress, the presence of minor ailments, presence 
of teeth, etc., were also recorded. 

In order to obtain comparable series, it was necessary to work 
up the actual age of the child in days on each of the occasions on 
which it was weighed. The weights of the infants in each series, 
i.e. breast-fed and artificially -fed, which had attained the same 
day of life, were then added together and divided by the number of 
observations available. For convenience it was necessary to group 
these into periods of eight days. The results of this grouping 
were then tabulated. They are given fully in the Appendix and 
shown graphically on the diagram, on the next page. 

It will be necessary to consider this diagram in three divisions : 

1. The early days of life. 

2. The period from about six weeks to six months. 

3. The period from six months onwards. 

First Period. A detailed investigation of the first period is 
somewhat beyond the scope of this present work. The number 
of observations was small compared with those of a later age, and 
hence somewhat less reliable. The divergence between the two 
groups was examined by statistical methods and was shown to be 
attributable in large measure to the difference in the methods of 
feeding. At this period of life special value attaches to breast- 
feeding, and the infant put upon artificial food from birth apparently 
suffers more markedly in the early days than later. The cause 
of this has already been investigated in previous chapters, and it 
is not necessary to deal with it any further here. Complications 
evidently arise in this period in regard to the loss of weight which 
occurs in all children during the early days after birth,

Second Period. In many ways this period is the most interesting

one for the subject under consideration. An examination of the 
curves from about the sixth week to the sixth month of life 
shows that at the beginning of this period there was already some 



NUTRITIVE VALUE OP RAW AND BOILED MILK 197 

divergence between the curves, becoming somewhat increased 
later and then diminishing fairly rapidly, until at a period rather 
later than the sixth month, this difference has altogether disappeared. 

If reference be made to the tables given in Appendix D showing 
the number of observations and the weights of the infants on each 
day of life, it will be seen that the number of observations available 
became larger shortly after the sixth week, and remained at a high 
level during the whole period under consideration. The number 
of observations is such as to eliminate any reasonable source of 
error and to render the observations reliable. 

The weight curves of the two series show that the artificially 
fed infant suffers from the disadvantage of its feeding for some 
weeks after birth, when it begins to regain some of the lost ground, 
and at about the sixth month it succeeds for the most part in 
catching up, in weight at any rate, its breast-fed fellows. Evidently, 
however, certain considerations must be borne in mind, and the 
matter is not quite so simple as above outlined. 

In the first place it may be argued that the artificially-fed 
children may be children of weaker parents, since the mother was 
apparently unable to breast-feed her infant. Against this it may 
be borne in mind that, speaking generally, the artificially-fed infants 
are for the most part children of parents whose earnings are sufficient 
to enable them to provide better hygienic surroundings for the 
infant. This circumstance would probably to some extent mitigate 
the disadvantage under which the child might suffer if the health 
of its mother were unsatisfactory. In Berlin, if investigation of 
the home circumstances showed that the parents could not afford to 
buy milk, and it were necessary for any reason that the child should 
be artificially fed, arrangements were made to supply the milk either 
free or at a much reduced rate. In order to eliminate as far as 
possible any source of error which might arise from these con- 
siderations, a statistical investigation was undertaken of the 
relationship of the nature of the food with the wages earned by 
the father. 

(Note. The wages of the father were in all cases given on the 
record charts and were available for use in these investigations, as well 
as the other information in regard to the progress of the infant.) 

The result of the statistical investigation which is described 
fully in the original paper, showed that the nature of the food 
given, that is breast milk or boiled cows' milk, was more im- 
portant to the infant than the wages of its father. In this con- 
nection the reservation above mentioned as to the absence of 
shortage of milk supply for the children, owing to the action of the 
municipality, must be taken into consideration. 

The rate of growth of the infants in the two series was studied. 
This was done in two ways. In the first place the percentage gain 
shown by each series during each eight-day period was calculated. 
Secondly, the rate at which growth progressed in each series

NUTRITIVE VALUE OF RAW AND BOILED MILK 199 

was also worked out. In this latter case the calculations were 
based on the weights of each series on the sixteenth day, the data 
of earlier periods being regarded as unreliable. The percentages 
given b}' the first method have been charted in relation to the age of 
the infant, and are shown in Diagram 9 on the preceding page. This 
shows that the actual percentage increase in weight from one eight- 
day period to another, of all the infants of each series considered in 
the aggregate, is extremely variable ; even where infants of precisely 
the same age are considered in large numbers, as in this investigation, 
there appears to be no constant rate of growth from birth onwaros. 
The figures showing the rate of growth are given in Appendix D. 
The percentages, although (except in two cases) positive, show an 
extraordinary variation, and differ in range between o - 6 and 
0'8 per cent, in the breast-fed series, and between 1*4 and 6'8 in 
the artificially fed series, during the life-period now under con- 
sideration. It is frequently believed by those concerned with the 
feeding of infants that the infant's weight should show a constant 
increase from day to day. Doubtless this does occur in a con- 
siderable number of children, although in most infants the amount 
of increase will vary very considerably not only from day to day 
but from week to week. The present investigations, however, 
seem to indicate sufficiently clearly that a large number of children 
who are reasonably healthy show much variety in relation to their 
progress from day to day. In many cases a slight loss occurs, to 
be followed at a succeeding period by a larger rise than that of the 
loss incurred. 

The fluctuations appear to be slightly less marked in the arti- 
ficially fed infants than in the breast-fed infants. In both series 
there is a tendency for the percentage increase between any two 
consecutive periods to become less as the age advances. 

It has long been recognised that the infant gains weight more 
rapidly in the first few months of life than it does later, the progress 
becoming slower after the first few months. 

If, now, the results of the second method, showing the rate 
of increase of weight of the infants in the two series from the 
sixteenth day of life onwards, be considered, it is found that from 
the beginning of the period up to about the fifth month there 
is very little difference in the curves. This absence of 
difference is accounted for by the fact that the artificially-fed 
infants show for the most part a lower absolute weight. Hence 
a less increment is needed in order to show a similar percentage 
increase to that of the breast-fed series. This is shown on the 
diagram on p. 200. It may be observed that after approximately 
the fifth month, the artificially-fed infants gain at a slightly 
greater rate than the breast-fed infants. For figures see 
Appendix D. 

The deficit in weight of the series of artificially-fed infants 
over that of the breast-fed infants was also investigated, and 



200 



MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



it was found that the maximum difference in the weight at any 
one six-day period between the two series did not at any time 
reach 10 per cent, of the whole, and the percentage on the majority 
of the average weights was very greatly below this figure. 

In order to eliminate any possible source of error owing to the

overlapping of feeding in the two series, i.e. either through a certain 
amount of mixed feeding in the breast-fed series or through 
commencing weaning towards the sixth month, it was decided to 
investigate in greater detail the curves of such children of the 
series as were entirely breast-fed up to at least the sixth month, 
and those who had been artificially fed from birth upwards. It 
was found that out of the 204 babies who were fed on boiled cows'

milk, 78 had never received the breast and 41 had received it for 
periods which in no case exceeded eight days, and in many cases 
was considerably less. Among the breast-fed series 130 infants 
out of the 300 were taken, who had received only the breast up 
to the 200th day of life or longer. 

A comparison of these two subsidiary series 1 on the same lines 
as before showed a rather greater divergence of the curves during

the period under consideration, but a tendency for the curves to 
approximate towards the end of the period. This is shown on 
Diagram n, which gives the weights up to the 200th day. 

The rate of growth was also studied in a similar manner to 
that already explained in the two main series, and showed that 
although the percentage rate of growth was slightly less in the 
artificially-fed infants, here again the tendency was shown for 

1 The figures relating to the subsidiary series are given in the original 
paper. 



202 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

the curves to approximate about the 20oth day of life. It is 
possible, therefore, that slight overl?pping is shown in the curves 
of the two main series, but ag?inst this possibility it must be 
remembered thrt the number of infants considered in these two 
subsidiary series is only approximately half the number contained 
in the main series, and hence the sources of error are considerably 
increased. 

In view of the fact that the artificially-fed children undoubtedly 
suffer more in the early days of life than later, as a result of their 
method of feeding, it may reasonably be believed that these results 
are among the most favourable which could be anticipated in 
connection with artificial feeding. The cases were taken hap- 
hazard from among the poorer population, and in many instances 
the housing accommodation was known to be unsatisfactory. 

Taking into consideration the clinical evidence and the evidence 
contained in these Berlin investigations, where the infants were 
not in institutions but were in their own homes throughout the 
period of the investigation, it seems difficult to believe that there 
can be any disadvantage in using boiled cows' milk instead of raw 
cows' milk, when artificial feeding is necessary. The initial loss would 
hardly be less on the raw cows' milk and might conceivably be more 
in view of the composition of the colostrum and the absorption 
of foreign proteins which has been considered fully in previous 
chapters. The fact that the infants thus artificially fed catch up 
the breast-fed babies at the age of about six months, shows 
that at one period the rate of growth is more rapid on the part 
of those artificially-fed children, than on the part of the breast- 
fed ones. 

Third Period. This period extends approximately from the 
sixth month of life up to the end of the first year. During the 
first part of the period the weight-curves are approximately equal, 
the curve of the breast-fed babies showing, however, rather more 
fluctuation than that of the artificially-fed ones. 

Several causes arise at about the sixth month to account for 
the approximation of the curves of the two series at this period 
and for the fact that they remain parallel up to the end of the first 
year. In the first place many of the children were weaned at about 
the sixth month, and were placed upon the same food, that is, boiled 
cows' milk, as the infants in the artificially-fed series. Hence the 
food of the two series tends to become more similar, and by about 
the ninth month it is probable that all the differences in the feeding 
were eliminated. Further, in the breast-fed series between the 
sixth and the ninth month it is probable that the milk supply of 
the mother was no longer as plentiful as in the earlier months, and 
it is not unlikely that the infant was receiving rather less food than 
the corresponding artificially-fed infant, whose food supply was 
regulated by the physician. The regulation of the food supply in 
the artificially-fed series probably accounts for the lesser fluctua- 



NUTRITIVE VALUE OF RAW AND BOILED MILK 203 

tion in percentage gains which has already been noted as occurring 
in this series as compared with the breast-fed series. 

It must not be supposed that because the children who were 
artificially fed show at a later date an equal weight with the 
breast-fed children, that there is nothing advantageous in breast- 
feeding. Doubtless where the infants are under constant medical 
supervision, as was the case in the infants in the Berlin series, 
the results of artificial feeding are in great measure mitigated. 

It is well known that the death-rate among artificially-fed infants 
during the first year of life is very much higher than that among the 
breast-fed infants. This alone emphatically condemns artificial 
feeding from the public health point of view. 

Further, even when medical supervision is available, the 
medical records of the Berlin series showed that the artificially- 
fed infants were more frequently indisposed and suffered from 
minor ailments to a much greater degree than the breast-fed infants. 
Many of the breast-fed babies appear to have been exempt from 
minor ailments throughout the greater part of their first year of 
life, whereas among the artificially-fed ones there are numerous 
records of dyspeptic conditions, mild bronchitis, and slight attacks 
of diarrhoea. The sickness incidence which is recorded on the 
artificially-fed series bears out what is already known, namely, 
that the mortality figures merely form a partial index of the 
general prevalence of whatever disease may be under consideration. 
For every infant that dies as a result of its feeding, a consider- 
ably greater number will show minor ailments which will possibly 
impair the constitution, but will probably not lead to death. 

Of recent years a large amount of information has been obtained 
and recorded at the numerous infant consultation centres in this 
and other countries. In a few cases the presiding physician has 
worked up the figures of infants' weights and the medical notes, 
and has published the results obtained. In the majority of these 
cases, however, the number of infants which are under observation 
over a prolonged period and fed upon the same diet is not large. They 
all, however, confirm the facts already brought forward, and show 
the great superiority of breast-feeding over any other method of 
feeding, due regard being had to the social conditions of the infants. 

One or two of the publications upon this matter deserve 
recording, but in the majority of cases the general trend, although 
supporting the above remarks, is not sufficiently precise to be 
utilised for the present purpose. Phillipson reports the results 
of observations upon twenty-three artificially-fed babies at the 
infant consultation at Frankfort. The children were about a month 
old when the observations were commenced and were all under 
observation for some weeks. The infants were fed on simple milk 
dilutions, the milk being heated. The children appear to have made 
satisfactory progress and no untoward after-effects were observed. 

Krost, of Chicago, reports upon the feeding of 500 babies whose 



2<H MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

diet was supervised by him at the infant welfare station in that 
city. Some of the infants appear to have been fed upon raw and 
others upon boiled milk. Krost reports that he used boiled milk 
for six months for the babies so fed and found no ill-effects. The 
gain in weight from week to week was about the same in babies 
fed both on raw and boiled milk. After some months' feeding 
by these methods, however, the gain in weight was greater in the 
boiled milk babies than in those fed upon raw milk. 

Reference might be made to several other papers where more 
or less details are given relating to small series of infants fed upon 
raw or boiled milk. These papers, however, do not add anything 
to the statements above made. Opinions are purposely not quoted, 
because these, as is well known, are liable to be formed without a 
full consideration of the actual facts available. It would be easy, 
however, to quote the opinions of many well-known physicians which 
support the information already given.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER XII 

ON DRIED MILK AS A FOOD FOR INFANTS 

THE use of dried milk as a food for infants is a development of 
the last few years. It seems likely, however, that it is a develop- 
ment which will continue. 

A large variety of dried milks are on the market, but of these 
numerous varieties, three appear to be most commonly used for 
infant feeding. These are the Just-Hatmaker dried milk, Glaxo, 
and Trumilk. Glaxo is a modified milk which approximates 
in composition to human milk. The other two milks are merely 
dried without the addition of other substances. 

A number of estimations of the composition of dried milks 
have been made and appear to be fairly uniform. The published 
figures give the following for the composition : 

Fat, approximately . . . 25 to 28 per cent. 

Protein, practically the same as fat. 

Sugar . . . . . . 34 to 40 per cent. 

Ash 6 to 7 per cent. 

Water 5 to 7 per cent. 

Roughly, the solids are present in eight times the strength of the 
original milk, although this figure must not be regarded as an 
absolute one. 

The above figures refer to full milk which has been dried. 
Several manufacturers also produce a variety known as ' half- 
cream ' milk, in which the fat is only present in about half the 
usual amount. This raises the proportion of the other constituents 
in relation to the fat, and also increases the percentage amount of 
the other constituents present in the milk. 

Further, dried milk is also prepared in which there is only a 
small residue of fat, the milk having been previously passed through 
a separator, to remove the cream. In such milk the percentage 
figures for the other constituents will evidently be raised still 
higher in relation to the total dried substances. 

In individual cases sugar (both lactose and cane sugar) has been 

206 



DRIED MILK AS A FOOD FOR INFANTS 207 

added to the dried milk with a view to increasing its nutrient value 
for infants. But, speaking generally, these preparations are not 
on the market. 

Dried milk for infants appears to have been used first in Bruges, 
Lille, and Lyons. I have been unable to obtain detailed informa- 
tion as to the use of the milk in the first two places, although reports 
of the work are quoted by some of the French authors. It is 
stated that the results obtained were very favourable. Details 
are, however, available of the results obtained in Lyons and in 
Paris. Dried milk is also used extensively in certain towns in this 
country. 

France. Some divergence of opinion has arisen among the 
French observers in regard to the value of dried milk as a routine 
method for the artificial feeding of infants. 

In 1912 Professor Porcher, of the Veterinary College at Lyons, 
published a book dealing with the methods of the desiccation of 
milk, and showing the results he had obtained upon a number of 
individual children. He showed that dried milk gave very satis- 
factory results when employed as a food for infants. Successful 
results have also been published by Bonnamour, of Lyons, who 
substantiates Porcher's work in regard to the suitability of dried 
milk as a food for infants. The half-cream variety appears to be 
very generally used in France, for infants fed on dried milk, at 
any rate up to the age of about six months. 

England. In this country dried milk is extensively used by 
certain municipalities and also in connection with the work for 
infant and child welfare which is carried out by a number of 
voluntary agencies. 

It is unfortunate that up to the present no detailed work upon 
the results obtained by the use of dried milk for infants in this 
country have been published, but general statements have been 
made by Pritchard (St. Marylebone), Naish (Sheffield), and Killick 
Millard (Leicester). 



CHAPTER XII 

ON DRIED MILK AS A FOOD FOR INFANTS 

The Chemical Composition o! Dried Milk. A considerable number 
of investigations have been carried out upon the composition of 
dried milk. The various preparations of dried milk which are 
manufactured from whole milk show a considerable similarity in 
chemical composition, as might have been anticipated from the 
nature of the case. The majority of the detailed investigations 
have been carried out in Germany, where the milk appears to be 



208 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

used mainly in the process of the manufacture of chocolate, rather 
than for feeding purposes. 

Goy investigated the composition of dried milk obtained both 
from America and also prepared locally in Germany. He found 
that in samples of whole milk, fat and protein were present in 
almost equal proportions and amounted in each case to 
approximately 25 per cent, of the total substance, sugar being 
from 38-40 per cent, of the total content, ash from 6-8 per 
cent., with a small percentage of water, amounting to about 4 
per cent. Evidently these proportions will not hold where the 
milk has been deprived of all or part of the cream, in which case 
the fat content will be reduced and the content of the other 
substances proportionally raised. 

Figures were also obtained by Kuhl, who gives Fat, 
22-26 per cent. ; protein, 25-26 per cent. ; sugar, 34-37 per cent. ; 
ash, 5-6 per cent. 

Utz gives somewhat similar figures, namely Fat, 26-30 per 
cent. ; protein, 24-26 per cent. ; sugar, 34-40 per cent. ; ash, 5-7 
per cent. 

Such figures as are given incidentally in other work are all 
corroborative of the above. 

Bonnamour (i) states that one litre of milk produces approxi- 
mately 125 grammes of dried milk, and Goy estimates that 12 
grammes of powder correspond to 100 c.c. of milk, that is, the 
proportion is roughly 8 : i, or the powder represents eight times 
the strength of ordinary milk. This figure is agreed with by 
numerous other observers, commenting upon the composition of 
dried milk. 

There is some difference of opinion in regard to the keeping 
qualities of dried milk, some authors stating that the samples 
keep for many months, while others do not consider that milk 
can safely be kept for so long a period. Goy, in his investigations, 
used some samples which were several months old and found that 
the material was quite fresh. He carried out experiments with 
a view to ascertaining some of the physical changes which were 
likely to have occurred as a result of the drying of the milk. He 
found that the fat globules had changed in form, and did not 
emulsify very readily, but on allowing the milk prepared from the 
powder to stand in a cylinder, the fat rose to the top in the usual 
manner. Several observers (Goy, Jacquet, and others) comment 
upon the low degree of acidity of milk, prepared from the dried 
powder. 

Investigations have also been carried out upon the bacterial 
content of dried milk. Kuhl states that the bacteria are not all 
killed, and that the bacterial content does not permit of the milk 
being kept for prolonged periods. Goy appears to consider that 
bacteria are still present, but he states that the milk is too dry 
to allow of any bacterial growth. 



DRIED MILK AS A FOOD FOR INFANTS 209 

Delepine, who carried out investigations upon the bacterial 
content of milk, which had been subjected to the drying process, 
concludes that there is a very great reduction in the total number 
of bacteria present, but that the milk is not rendered sterile in 
the process. 

The investigators above mentioned draw attention to the changes 
in relative composition which must be allowed for, when the fat is 
removed prior to desiccation. 

Experimental Data on the Value of Dried Milk as a Food. 
A few investigations have been carried out with a view to ascer- 
taining the nutritive value of dried milk as a food. Jacquet 
subjected himself to a diet of dried milk and rusks for a period of 
six days. He examined carefully the nitrogen taken in and the 
nitrogen eliminated, and found that nitrogenous equilibrium was 
maintained after the first two days of this diet, while in the 
later days there was a slight retention of nitrogen. Jacquet 
also carried out observations on the metabolism of a child of seven 
months who was fed on dried milk, with satisfactory results. 
The nitrogen content of the milk taken was estimated and also 
the nitrogen content of the faeces. A high rate of absorption 
of nitrogen was found, amounting to over 90 per cent. 

Brezina and Lazar carried out metabolism experiments upon 
one adult and three children. The results showed a better utilisation 
of the milk by the children than by the adult. The children were 
aged four, seven, and eight years respectively, and other food 
was allowed during the course of the experiment. The diet 
included at first a given quantity of raw milk, the nitrogen meta- 
bolism being investigated. The raw milk was then changed to 
dried milk. The highest absorption of nitrogen took place in the 
youngest child, aged four, and reached 92-93 per cent, of the total. 
The percentage of nitrogen absorbed by the other children was 
92 per cent, in the case of the child of seven and 86 per cent, in the 
case of the child of eight. 

Seligmann fed dogs first upon raw and then upon dried milk, 
and found that the utilisation of the dried milk was apparently 
not quite so good as that of the raw milk. The dogs were young 
puppies of the same litter, and the experiment was carried out over 
a short period only. 

Delepine conducted some feeding experiments on rabbits, using 
raw cows' milk, condensed milk and dried milk. In each series 
of animals four rabbits were used, and the amount of food and the 
weight of the rabbit on each day were noted. The rabbits were 
young and were kept under observation for two weeks before com- 
mencing the experiment, which lasted for approximately nine 
weeks. Oats were given in addition to the milk, but as this was 
arranged in a similar manner for all groups, it need not be con- 
sidered in detail. 

The dried milk was made up with sterilised water, at first in 

r

the proportion of one part of dried milk to four of water, and after 
eight days in the proportion of one to six. The condensed milk 
was prepared in the proportion of one part of milk to three of water. 
The fresh milk was received at the laboratory less than two hours 
after the afternoon milking. Each variety of milk was either kept 
in a refrigerator or incubated until it was used the following 
morning. Each group of rabbits was divided into two, two animals 
of each group being fed on refrigerated milk, and two on milk 
incubated at 22 C., a temperature which was afterwards raised 
to 30 C. 

Deldpine records that ' the refrigerated milk diet seemed to 
agree with all the rabbits for about one month, after which the 
animals generally began to lose weight, but on replacing 30 c.c. 
of milk by 30 gms. of cabbage, they gradually regained the lost 
weight.' In this connection it is interesting to compare the experi- 
ments carried out upon young guinea-pigs in regard to raw and 
boiled milk, where it was shown that a vegetable dietary is 
a necessity for these animals. 

The conclusions reached by Deldpine are summed up by him as 
follows : ' On comparing the groups of weights, it is clear that the 
animals fed on dried milk diluted seven times gained weight more 
rapidly than those fed on condensed milk diluted four times, or on 
undiluted normal milk. The superiority of dry milk over fresh 
milk observed in this set of experiments may be purely accidental, 
but with regard to the differences between dry milk and con- 
densed milk the explanation is obvious, for even though the 
condensed milk was diluted only four times the reconstituted 
condensed milk was poorer in protein and fatty matter than 
the reconstituted dry milk, this being due to the fact that more 
than one-half of the solid constituents of condensed milk consists 
of cane sugar.' 

All the rabbits did not survive to the end of the experiment. 
One fed on condensed, one on fresh refrigerated milk, and all 
the rabbits fed on incubated milk died before the end of the experi- 
ment, with the exception of one rabbit fed on fresh incubated milk. 
Two of these animals had suffered from acute gastro-enteritis, but 
there was some evidence that the milk had not been the source of 
the infection. The results obtained with the incubated milk are 
of interest when compared with the results obtained by Vincent, 
who used milk which had been heated and then incubated as a food 
for kittens. 1 

The experiments on rats conducted by myself, and referred to on 
p. 179, also showed the favourable results obtained with dried milk. 

Clinical Data on the Value of Dried Milk as a Food for Infants. 
The value of dried milk as a food is of considerable importance 
both clinically and economically. 

If good results can be obtained by the use of dried milk for 
1 Seep. 182, 



211 

infants, many of the difficulties of the milk supply are obviated. 
It must be clearly stated, however, that no subsequent treatment 
of the milk, such as desiccation, should be allowed to provide an 
excuse for dirty methods, or for carelessness in milk production 
or in transit. 

Much of the danger of contamination in the home is avoided 
by the use of dried milk, and there is no temptation to give the 
infant stale milk from motives of either economy or laziness. The 
milk supply is at hand and can be used as required. 

Economically it avoids waste in the homes, and if carried out 
on a large scale should help to reduce waste in the general supply. 

A good deal of discussion has arisen upon the nutritive value of 
dried milk for the routine feeding of infants. The first investi- 
gations were made in France and Belgium, and formed the cause 
of much discussion both in Lyons and Paris. The developments 
in dried milk feeding are of recent date, the book published by 
Prof. Porcher appearing in 1912. Dried milk had been used in 
several places for infant feeding before this date, but the cases 
were comparatively few in number and the results had not been 
published. 

Porcher and Bonnamour, in Lyons, have upheld the feeding 
of infants with dried milk, not necessarily to the exclusion of 
boiled milk obtained fresh, but as affording a safe food for infants, 
more especially perhaps in the summer-time and also as a supple- 
mentary food to breast-feeding. 

Bonnamour (i, 2) gives details of a number of cases fed by him at 
his infant consultation in Lyons. Out of 900 children which passed 
through his hands some 56 had to be artificially fed over pro- 
longed periods, and these children were fed upon dried milk. 
Bonnamour groups them under four main headings : 

Group I. Nine infants who received mixed feeding for a 
short period. Dried milk was gradually increased as the breast 
milk failed. 

Group II. Six infants only breast-fed for a few days. 

Group III. Seventeen infants fed exclusively on dried milk 
after a preliminary period of two or three months' breast-feeding. 

Group IV. Twenty-one sick children who were for the most 
part ' nurse ' children in bad condition. 

Bonnamour used half-cream milk up to six months of age 
with proportions of one teaspoonful of milk to three of water, 
rising gradually to three of milk to eight or nine of water. He 
obtained for the most part extremely good results, although the 
weight curves of some of the children remained somewhat low. 

The accompanying diagram (see next page) shows the weight 
curve of a case taken from Group III. 

Bonnamour states that he did not prescribe dried milk as a 
food for infants who were making satisfactory progress upon 
ordinary boiled or sterilised^ milk. He found, however, that it

physicians do not agree with Bonnamour in regard to his favourable 



DRIED MILK AS A FOOD FOR INFANTS 213 

estimate of the value of dried milk, although their observations 
did not extend over any large number of cises. Generally, it 
appears that they recognise the value of dried milk for sickly 
children who are unable to take ordinary milk, although in certain 
case^ as much intolerance is shown for dried milk as for ether forms 
of milk. 

Bonnamour, in a discussion upon this subject held by the 
physicians of Lyons, states that he had only met five cases of 
intolerance to dried milk in the course of eight years' experience. 
In the course of the discussion Bouchoud gave details of cases 
treated by him with dried milk, and professed himself converted 
from a former stage of doubt as to the value of dried milk. 

Favourable results on pathological cases (twenty-four children) 
were also given by Weill and Mouriquand, who, however, doubted 
the advisability of using it as a routine method of feeding. 

Plauchu disagreed with Bonnamour and Porcher in the favour- 
able results they claim to have obtained, but has not himself given 
any details of cases treated by him with dried milk. 

Favourable results have also been obtained by Avriaguet, 
Bloch-Michel, and Dorlemcourt. These authors used dried milk 
for cases of mixed feeding and for dyspeptic children, and obtained 
very satisfactory results, although they state that doubtless satis- 
factory results could also have been obtained by using boiled 
milk. They believe that the results with dried milk are due to 
the increased digestibility of the casein and albumen as a result 
of the heating process. 

Variot states that he used dried milk for some fourteen cases 
of sick children and considered that the results obtained were 
poor. The experiments do not appear to have extended over any 
length of period. 

Nageotte-Wilbouchewitch believed that Variot's conclusions 
were hardly justified in view of the small number of cases treated 
by him vvith dried milk, and quotes figures from Ghent and Bruges 
in support of this statement. 

(Detailed information as to the work on these lines in Bruges 
and Ghent are not available.) 

Pouliot states that dried milk is especially valuable for use in 
intestinal disturbances. 

Comby, reviewing the situation as a whole, considers that dried 
milk should be regarded as a useful form of food, owing to the 
dangers which arise from the use of ordinary milk. 

At the English-speaking conference on Infant Mortality, held 
in London in 1913, evidence was given as to the use of dried milk 
for infants. 

Pritchard reported the use of dried milk, both as whole milk 
and as separated milk, with good results, and Naish gave informa- 
tion as to the use of dried milk among a large number of infants 
in Sheffield. In this town there are large municipal infant consulta- 



2i 4 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

tions, and it has been the practice oi: the physicians at this institu- 
tion for some years, to recommend dried milk for such cases as 
require artificial feeding, either entirely or as supplementary to 
breast-feeding. This milk has been used for several thousands 
of children, although the precise figures are not available. The 
infants are kept under medical supervision. Naish states that he 
has obtained very good results with the use of this form of milk, 
and that no disadvantages have been observed. Summing up the 
considerations advanced, he says : ' We have in dried milk a food 
which contains the same substances as cows' milk and in the same 
proportions (except when humanised), which is adjustable to a 
wider range of infants, which has obvious advantages of storage 
and distribution, and which appears to have no danger of the later 
nutritional disorders.' 

Generally favourable results have also been obtained in other 
places of which no published information is available. Further 
data as to the use of dried milk are given in Chapter XIII, dealing 
with the alleged production of scurvy and rickets, and also in 
Appendix E. 

The manufacture of dried milk is described in Appendix F.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER XIII 

ON THE ALLEGED PRODUCTION OF BARLOW'S DISEASE AND RICKETS 
BY THE USE OF HEATED MILK FOR INFANTS 

CASES of Barlow's disease have always attracted, and will probably 
continue to attract, very considerable attention on the part of 
the medical profession. The acute symptoms, followed i y their 
rapid subsidence under adequate treatment, compel attention, 
although the disease cannot be regarded as in any sense one of 
common occurrence. 

It has been stated to be due to the use of heated milk, but the 
degree of heat and the method of heating employed have not in 
every case received that attention which they deserve, before the 
statement was made. 

Most physicians appear now to have relinquished the general 
idea that this disease is produced by the heating of milk, but it 
cannot be said that an adequate explanation of its etiology has been 
reached. 

The details of cases given in discussions upon Barlow's disease 
which took place in Berlin in 1903, and in America in 1898 and in 
1914, seem to show that there may be a close connection between 
the two-fold heating of milk and the production of Barlow's disease. 
It is not, however, clear whether such a connection may not be 
closely related to the length of time the milk has been kept. 
One of the great dangers of heated milk on a commercial scale, 
is the tendency for such milk to be kept longer than would have 
been the case had the milk not been heated. A false sense of 
security appears to be engendered by the heating of milk, which 
induces both the salesman and the consumer to delay unduly the 
consumption of the milk. 

A large number of the cases of scurvy have been shown to be 
associated with the use of proprietary foods of different types, 
and occur mainly among the children of the well-to-do. Breast- 
fed babies are not exempt from this disease. It would seem that 
a monotonous dietary may produce the disease, as also one which 
is remote in quality from the child's normal food. 

The increasing attention which is now bestowed upon infant 

216 



ALLEGED PRODUCTION OF BARLOW'S DISEASE 217 

feeding shows that it is impossible to lay down hard and fast nfes 
for the feeding of infants, although there can be little doubt thot the 
most suit; ble food for infants is the natural food, that is, the milk 
of its mother. 

There is no evidence to show that the use of heated milk is 
productive of rickets in young children. 



CHAPTER XIII 

ON THE ALLEGED PRODUCTION OF BARLOW'S DISEASE AND RICKETS 
BY THE USE OF HEATED MILK FOR INFANTS 

THE literature upon the subject of Barlow's disease, its etiology, 
course, and treatment, is too great for any attempt to be made to 
consider it completely. It is merely proposed to give the more 
important papers and the discussions dealing with a large number of 
cases of this disease, which have been analysed by different authors. 

The first cases in the literature were published by Cheadle in 
1878, but the cases quoted in the years following Cheadle's com- 
munication do not appear to have been very numerous. 

In 1898 a full discussion on infantile scurvy took place in 
Boston, Mass., by the American Pediatric Society. This society 
sent out circular letters to numerous physicians, requesting them 
to fill in the details asked for on the papers sent. The papers 
contained questions on a comprehensive scale, dealing with the 
number of cases seen, the food which had been given prior to 
the onset of the disease, the treatment prescribed, and the results 
obtained. Records of 379 cases of the disease were thus obtained 
by the Pediatric Society. A committee was appointed to analyse 
the records, which consisted of Drs. Griffiths, Jennings, and Morse, 
and the results obtained were considered at a meeting of the Medical 
and Chirurgical Society. A few of the details thus collected may 
be given here. 

The age at which the disease occurred was found to vary from 
three weeks to nine years, but the great majority of the cases 
occurred between the ages of seven and thirteen or fourteen months. 
The social circumstances of the children attacked were for the 
most part good. Eighty-three per cent, of the cases occurred in 
the private practice of the physicians supplying the information, and 
only 17 per cent, in their hospital practice. Out of the 379 cases, 
the information given showed that in 303 cases the circumstances 
were ' good,' and in only 40 cases were they described as ' bad.' The 
diet before the onset of the disease was found to vary very greatly, 
but in the majority of instances either sterilised milk or patent 
foods of one form or another had been given. Of the total 



2i8 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

number 10 had been entirely breast-fed, 4 had received only raw 
milk, and 16 pasteurised milk. Recovery followed in a great many 
cases without any change of diet or merely on the addition of beef 
juice or fruit juice. In a fair number of cases recovery followed by 
merely changing the diet, which was sometimes accompanied by 
the addition of fruit juice, but this was not always found to be 
necessary. 

The conclusions of the committee, after studying the analysis 
made, were to the effect that the disease appeared to be due to 
prolonged use of an unsuitable dietary, that the more remote 
this dietary from the natural food the more likely it appeared that 
scurvy would supervene. This was more especially the case with 
proprietary foods. 

In 1900, dealing with the occurrence of Barlow's disease and 
rickets, Escherich says : ' I have not once seen infantile scurvy 
among all the many thousands of children fed artificially and 
with sterilised milk which passed through my hands in Miinchen 
and Graz.' 

In the year 1902-3 a great increase in the number of cases 
of Barlow's disease appears to have been noticed in Berlin. About 
this date one of the large dairies of Berlin which collected the 
milk from a considerable distance and supplied it to a great 
many of the well-to-do families, adopted a method of pasteurisa- 
tion. The pasteurisation appears to have been carried out on a 
very large scale, and the milk to have been sold in a large measure 
for special infants' milk. It is noted by several observers upon 
this subject that the milk was altered in character, having some- 
times a brownish colour and appearing to have been heated to a 
considerable temperature. 

In 1902 Neumann (i) of Berlin, in a paper dealing with Barlow's 
disease, quotes twenty cases which had occurred in his own 
practice. He stated his belief that the disease was due to a double 
heating of the milk, which was already pasteurised before being 
sold to the customer, and was then usually heated a second time 
in the house before being fed to the infant. He quotes especially 
two cases of scurvy. In one, a child aged twenty months, had always 
been given heated milk, which had been kept boiling for ten minutes 
in a Soxhlet apparatus. Some months previous to the outbreak of 
the disease the milk supply had been changed, and instead of being 
obtained raw had been obtained from this dairy in a pasteurised 
form and subsequently heated in the house. 

In the other case the child had been breast-fed for six months, 
and for eight months subsequently had received the pasteurised 
milk, which was afterwards heated in the Soxhlet apparatus. 

Neumann mentions that if careful observations are made it 
is usually noted that the children begin to refuse the food some 
months before the disease actually occurs. Usually, however, 
no attention is paid to this action on the part of the infant, 



ALLEGED PRODUCTION OF BARLOW'S DISEASE 219 

continual suasion being applied to induce the child to take its 
nourishment. 

In 1903 a paper was given by Heubner, who points out that 
in his experience the number of cases of Barlow's disease had 
increased very greatly of recent years. He quoted sixty-five cases 
of the disease, details being given of fifty-five of these cases. The 
method of feeding was as follows : 

Thirteen had received good milk from various sources, usually 
given raw. 

Twelve cases had also received good milk which was sub- 
sequently heated in the Soxhlet apparatus for fifteen minutes. 

Nineteen cases had been fed on pasteurised milk, subsequently 
boiled in the home. 

Seven had received patent foods or condensed milk. 

Four had received starchy foods. 

An animated discussion followed Heubner's paper, in the 
course of which Neumann (2) stated his opinions, which have been 
already dealt with. Finkelstein quoted thirteen cases which had 
occurred in the previous eighteen months and gave details. He 
stated that of the thirteen cases five had received starchy food, but 
that the disease was cured even when the starchy food was continued, 
raw milk being given in addition. In seven cases milk had been 
given which was already pasteurised and then again heated in 
the home. In two of these cases it had only been boiled for five 
minutes in the home. In one case it was especially desired to 
avoid the occurrence of Barlow's disease in a child which had to 
be artificially fed, and the milk was given only just boiled, and 
fruit juice was added throughout the entire period of feeding. 
In spite of this precaution the child did develop scurvy, which, 
however, subsided under treatment, the details of which are not 
given. 

Schultze stated that he had recently seen a good many cases, 
but in practically all of them the milk had been pasteurised by the 
dairy and subsequently again in the home in a Soxhlet apparatus. 

Ritter stated that the increase in Barlow's disease in Berlin 
had begun since iqoo and was, he believed, due to the introduction 
of sterilisation. In the cases seen by him the length of heating 
varied from five to forty minutes, and out of twenty-two cases 
the milk had been heated for twenty minutes or more and other 
foods had also been given. 

In the course of the discussion it was pointed out that the 
cases did not occur among the poorer population, but were mainly 
among the population whose social circumstances were good, 
and where every care was taken in the preparation of the 
infants' food. 

Variot, in 1904, issued a report of his infant consultation a 
Belleville, near Paris. At this consultation the artificially-fed 
children received milk which had been heated to 108 C. Variot 



220 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

reviewed the work at his consultation and stated that in the 3000 
cases included in this report, there had been no case of Barlow's 
disease. 

Bresset, dealing with the results of similar work in another 
district in Paris, states that in over 2000 cases fed on sterilised 
milk no case suspicious of Barlow's disease was seen. 

Budin says : ' As for the so-called infantile scurvy which is 
alleged to follow the use of sterilised milk, I have heard a very 
great deal about it during the last few years, but I am still looking 
for my first case.' 

In the year 1908 the Medical Society of Geneva held an inquiry 
into the frequency of Barlow's disease in Switzerland. Papers 
of inquiry were sent to the medical men of the district, and seventy- 
one answers were received from different physicians. Of the 
seventy-one physicians only five had seen cases of the disease, 
and only ten cases in all were reported, of which six had occurred 
in Geneva itself. Of these ten cases nine had been fed either 
upon special forms of milk or upon milk sterilised at high 
temperatures. The tenth child had been fed upon milk prepared 
in a Soxhlet apparatus. 

An interesting case is quoted by Carel of a child who was taken 
away from home with a supply of sterilised milk sufficient to last 
for several weeks The child appears to have shown peculiar 
symptoms, which disappeared on the arrival of a fresh supply 
of sterilised milk. As this fresh supply became stale, the same 
symptoms, previously noticed, reappeared, and the child was brought 
up for medical advice. The case was diagnosed as one of infantile 
scurvy. This case suggests that it is not advisable to employ 
sterilised milk which has been kept, as a food for infants. 

Plantenga published an account of an outbreak of Barlow's 
disease which occurred among the children of his infant consulta- 
tion in 1910. The milk, which was given out at his consultation, 
was at one period pasteurised overnight by heating at 70 C. for 
half an hour, and in the morning was further heated by 
being boiled for five minutes in a Soxhlet apparatus. Twenty- 
three cases of Barlow's disease developed among the infants of the 
consultation, which numbered 200 in all. As a result of this 
outbreak the routine of the milk preparation was altered, and 
the morning's milk was obtained and subjected only to pasteurisa- 
tion before being given out. No case of Barlow's disease occurred 
with the adoption of this alteration. Plantenga attributed the 
occurrence of the trouble to the length of time the milk had been 
kept before being used, and he pointed out that the value of raw 
milk in certain cases may arise from the fact that it is given sooner 
after milking. 

There is evidence that changes occur in milk, when it is allowed 
to stand, and in this connection reference may be made to 
Appendix C, dealing with the preservation of human milk, and to the 



ALLEGED PRODUCTION OP BARLOW'S DISEASE 221 

work of Ellenbeck mentioned on pp. 79 and 113 in connection with 
the keeping of milk in the cold. 

Naish, dealing with the feeding of infants upon dried milk, 
says : ' With regard to scurvy, I believe the risk is non-existent. 
I did see one slight case two or three years ago, which was cured 
within three days, but the mother in this instance had been attending 
very irregularly, and I was never able to satisfy myself as to what 
the baby's diet really had been. Besides this I have seen no 
other, and I am not in the habit of ordering any orange juice or 
other anti -scorbutic.' 

Morse (i, 2), in 1914, dealt with eighty-seven cases of Barlow's 
disease which had occurred in the out-patient department of 
the children's hospital at Boston, Mass. He stated that there 
had been a marked increase in the number of cases of Barlow's 
disease which had developed, the percentage having risen from 
ii per cent, in 1904 to -87 per cent, in 1913 of all the new cases 
seen at the hospital. The cases had been fed as follows : 

Condensed milk . .... 4 cases. 

Proprietary foods with water . . . . 14 

,, raw milk . . . i 

,, pasteurised milk . i 

boiled milk . . 7 

In seventeen cases no precise data were available. 
Diluted milk had been given pasteurised in five cases. 

,, boiled or scalded, in twenty-three cases. 

without available details as to heating, in fourteen 

cases. 
Three cases had been breast-fed. 

In eleven cases which occurred in 1905 one had been breast- 
fed, two had received modified milk, and the others condensed 
milk or dried milk foods. 

Following on Morse's paper a discussion took place by the 
Medical Society upon the occurrence of Barlow's disease. 

Miller, of Atlantic City, believed that scurvy was increasing in 
this town, as he had himself seen twelve cases in the last two years 
in his own practice. In five of the cases there had been two 
pasteurisations carried out on the milk given to the infants. He 
believed that the production of scurvy might be due to a badly 
balanced diet. 

Several physicians spoke upon the question, and there appeared 
to be a general opinion that Barlow's disease was increasing in 
several cities. The New York physicians, however, thought that 
scurvy was decreasing in New York City in spite of the commer- 
cial pasteurisation of the milk supply. One of them believed 
that scurvy was due to artificial foods. 

Griffith, of Philadelphia, stated that a committee had 



222 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

investigated the question of scurvy and had reached the conclusion 
that changes of dietary were probably necessary. He reported 
the occurrence of ten cases in breast-fed babies. 

The result of the discussion was summed up by Morse, who 
concluded that there appeared to be nothing which could really 
point to the production of scurvy by pasteurised milk. 

Comby (2), in 1915, quoted twenty-six cases of scurvy in 
children, some of which had been previously fed on sterilised milk 
or on proprietary foods, or other special preparations. He stated 
that scurvy can be cured by the use of boiled milk and pointed out 
the dangers of a too great similarity of diet. 

Further information upon the literature of Barlow's disease 
can be obtained by consulting papers by Netter, Corlette, Schreiber 
and Francois, Comby (i), Heubner (2), Bolle, la Fetra, and others. 

Rickets. The production of rickets by the use of heated milk 
has been much discussed in recent years. The general experience, 
however, which has now been gained as a result of the large infant 
welfare centres in this and other countries, has tended to discredit 
any belief in the production of rickets by the use of boiled milk. 

It may be of interest, however, to give a few facts connected 
with this matter. 

Escherich, speaking in 1900, says : ' As regards the much 
disputed question of rickets, in my experience it is hardly less 
frequent in breast-fed babies than in bottle-fed ones. The worst 
degrees of rickets are, however, only met with in the latter class.' 
It may be mentioned that in the artificially-fed class Escherich was 
dealing entirely with infants fed upon milk called by him 'sterilised,' 
but which had apparently been subjected to prolonged boiling and 
not strict sterilisation. 

Bresset, in the work on his consultation already referred to, 
stated that rickets was extremely rare among the children attending 
the consultation. 

Variot stated (in the work already referred to) that a few cases 
which had been overfed or had received farinaceous food while 
still too young had developed rickets. These cases occurred in 
a total of about 3000. 

In the Berlin babies investigated by myself, it was shown that out 
of the total number of infants (504) investigated there were sixty- 
one cases where rickets appeared to be definitely developed and 
ten doubtful cases. Of the sixty-one cases thirty occurred in the 
breast-fed series and thirty-one in the boiled milk series. Too 
much stress must not however be laid upon these figures, as the 
children were in many cases not seen after the age of one year. 
The incidence of rickets in Berlin is admittedly high among the 
general population. 

Naish, in the work already referred to, says : ' I have followed 
up considerable numbers of those fed on dried milk, and noted 
the time at which independent walking commences ; this I have 



ALLEGED PRODUCTION OF BARLOWS DISEASE 223 

found to be usually within fourteen months, except where the 
infant has been very far from the normal at the time of its first 
attendance or has suffered subsequently from measles, whooping- 
cough or other bacterial infection ; in not a few cases the child 
has walked before the end of the first year, and in one case at nine 
months. I have also followed up as many as possible to the ages 
of three, four, and five years, and am personally convinced that 
there is no more risk of rickets with this diet than with a good 
quality raw cow's milk.' He also states that it is possible to cure 
rickets by changing a previously-given diet to a dried-milk diet. 

It is a well-known fact that the incidence of rickets varies con- 
siderably in different countries and in different districts, and it 
is probable that although feeding cannot be entirely excluded, 
other factors are concerned in the production of rickets. Many 
French physicians believe that rickets can be induced as a result 
of over-feeding, and this view is also held by Pritchard. 

Findlay, who has carried out experimental work upon the 
production of rickets, believes that bad sanitation and absence of 
proper ventilation must be regarded as largely responsible for the 
production of this disease. 

It is impossible to discuss the question of rickets further in this 
work.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER XIV 

CHANGES OCCURRING IN MILK AS A RESULT OF THE 
APPLICATION OF HEAT 

WHEN the use of boiled milk first became at all general, certain 
observers believed that they noticed a detrimental influence upon 
the children who were fed with milk which had been subjected to 
heat. The chemical changes which undoubtedly occur as a result 
of heating at temperatures not exceeding 100 C. were investigated 
by a considerable number of observers. Many of these investigators 
at once attributed the detrimental effects said to have been noticed, 
to the changes which they discovered in the milk, very frequently 
without any attempt to connect the statement with fact. 

It was found that the application of heat produced a lowering 
of the calcium content of milk by throwing the calcium out of 
solution. The amount of calcium precipitated was found to be 
different by the different authors who investigated the subject. 
In any case only a portion of the calcium falls out, and the total 
calcium content of cows' milk appears, even after boiling, to be 
equal to, or higher than, that of human milk. The changes in 
acidity and the delay in clotting with rennet, which were found 
to occur as a result of heating, were studied in detail. It is probable 
that both these phenomena are connected either directly or indirectly 
with the calcium content of the milk, and the changes occurring 
therein as a result of heating. 

Changes also occur in the protein on heating, but unless the 
temperature is allowed to reach considerably above 100 C. these 
changes appear to be confined to the albumin fraction. Different 
observers have given different temperatures for the commencement 
of precipitation of the albumin. It seems probable that compara- 
tively little change, if any, occurs below the temperature of 65 C., 
but that after this temperature has been reached an increasing 
amount of albumin is precipitated, the amount depending not 
only upon the absolute temperature reached, but also upon the 
length of time of heating. 

Changes of a more radical character do not take place in the 
milk unless the temperature is raised above 100 C. In the process 

225 



226 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

of desiccation, milk is exposed on rollers which are heated to a 
temperature of approximately 120 C. This exposure, however, is 
for a very short period only, and it has been shown by Delepine * 
that the maximum temperature probably does not at any time 
exceed 96 C., and that the duration of the exposure to that 
temperature approximates to 3-3 seconds. It need not therefore 
be anticipated that any appreciable change takes place in the 
protein of milk on desiccation. The albumin is probably in part 
coagulated, but there is no loss, since the whole of the dried milk 
is utilised. The work given in Chap. XII bears out the above 
remarks. 

Slight changes in viscosity occur in the fat when heat is employed, 
but no diminution in content appears to be noted below a tempera- 
ture of 100 C. or even somewhat above this temperature. The 
cream line is said to be affected at 150 F. approximately, but this 
is probably related to the changes in viscosity already alluded to. 

No change occurs in the lactose content unless the temperature 
be raised considerably above 100 C., when a brownish colour may 
occur which indicates that some caramelisation has taken place. 

The so-called ' biological properties ' have been studied with 
a view to determining the effect upon them of heat. Ferments 
are destroyed by a temperature of 100 C., or below, but as there 
is no reason to suppose that these, when present in milk, are of 
any value, the question of their destruction does not call for 
consideration. 

The properties which are concerned in immunity have also 
been the subject of investigation, but it cannot be said as yet that 
the results are entirely harmonious. It seems probable that 
where any alteration has been observed as a result of the heating 
of milk, this can be referred to the coagulation of the albumin or 
perhaps to the reduction in the calcium content of the fluid. In 
a number of cases where the effect of heat upon the reactions for 
immunity has been studied, no change has been detected when 
the temperature has reached 100 C. or even higher. It has been 
shown in Chap. VI that these properties are only of value to the 
suckling animal in the early days of life. In any case, therefore, 
the effect of heat after this period needs to be considered only in 
relation to the nutritive properties possessed by the proteins to 
which the properties are attached. This has already been done in 
the preceding chapters, where the satisfactory results obtained by 
the use of boiled milk have been dealt with in detail. 

There is no evidence to show that the reduction in calcium 
content which occurs when milk is boiled, has any influence on 
the human infant when artificially fed. Such other acid or basic 
radicals which may be present in the milk and appear to be slightly 
reduced by heating, are present in considerable excess in cows' 

1 Cp. Appendix F. 



CHANGES PRODUCED IN MILK BY HEAT 227 

milk when compared with human milk. It may therefore be 
reasonably assumed that, in relation to infant feeding, boiling pro- 
duces no detrimental effect upon the ash of milk. Moreover, it 
may be mentioned that these substances only pass from the soluble 
to the insoluble state, and there is no reason for supposing that 
they are incapable of being assimilated by the infant in this latter 
form. 

Generally speaking, the changes which occur on heating milk 
to a temperature of about 100 C. for a short period cannot be 
regarded as having any detrimental influence from the nutritional 
standpoint. Above this temperature changes undoubtedly occur, 
but for the most part high temperatures are not employed to any 
extent in connection with the feeding of infants. 



CHAPTER XIV 

CHANGES OCCURRING IN MILK AS A RESULT OF THE 
APPLICATION OF HEAT 

IT would not appear necessary to enter at any length into a dis- 
cussion of the literature concerned with the chemical changes 
produced by the heating of milk. The evidence which has been 
brought forward in the preceding chapters, provides sufficient 
testimony to the value of heated milk as a food for infants. Any 
additional consideration of the chemical changes taking place on 
heating is therefore a matter of interest, rather than directly con- 
nected with the hygienic aspect of the milk question. 

In view of the great discussion which has taken place during 
this century, and earlier, upon the changes due to heating, it 
is proposed to consider briefly the more important papers dealing 
with various aspects of this subject. There can be no question 
that changes do occur in connection with the heating of milk, but 
the degree of change is dependent upon the temperature and the 
length of time over which that temperature is maintained. The 
changes in the more important constituents alone will be con- 
sidered here. 

Changes occurring in the Protein Constituents of Milk as a 
Result of Heating. The proteins of milk have been considered 
already in Chap. Ill, where reference was made to the different 
proteins occurring in milk and to their relative proportions in 
both human and cows' milk. It was there stated that caseinogen 
forms the major part of the protein of cows' milk, while in human 
milk the proportion of caseinogen to albumin is more equal. 

Effect of Heat on Caseinogen. Caseinogen is not coagulated 

9 2 



228 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

by heat unless the temperature be raised above that usually 
employed for the milk of infants, but alterations apparently occur 
in the molecule which affect the action of digestive ferments upon 
this substance. The general trend of evidence shows that the 
digestibility of caseinogen is increased by heating, but one or two 
authors have believed the reverse. 1 

Netter (2) found that the digestion in the stomach of sterilised 
cows' milk was almost as good as that of human milk, but he is 
careful to point out that this does not imply that it is as good a 
food in all other respects. 

Klemperer investigated in the laboratory the digestibility of 
raw and boiled cows' milk, and was unable to detect any appreciable 
difference between the two. 

Gerber investigated the effect of caseases derived from plants, 
upon raw and boiled caseinogen. He found that these pancreatins 
did not produce any amino-acids, whatever amount of ferment was 
added. In heated milk, however, such action was obtained and 
varied with the amount of the ferment added and with the tem- 
perature to which the milk had been raised. No action occurred 
under a temperature of 67 C., but heating for ten to fifteen minutes 
at this temperature produced a small amount of soluble nitrogen. 
From 75 C. to 85 C. there was considerable increase in the 
amount of amino-acids formed, and very little further increase 
was obtained when the milk was heated at 100 C. 

Brennemann worked on the clot formation of casein in the 
stomach. He utilised for his investigations a young adult who 
had the capacity of regurgitating food without experiencing any 
discomfort. These experiments showed that the curd obtained 
with raw milk was very tough and large, while with boiled or 
sterilised milk it was soft and much finer in character. In con- 
nection with the digestibility of caseinogen it may be remembered 
that Brennemann and others found that the so-called ' casein curds ' 
in infants' stools, occur only when raw milk is given. 1 This 
suggests that caseinogen is more readily digested when the milk 
has been heated. The increased ease in the digestibility of the 
caseinogen of dried milk has already been referred to. 

It seems probable that the digestion of casein occurs for the 
most part in the small intestine. This conclusion was reached 
by Rotondi as a result of experiments on the digestion of both 
cows' and human caseinogen. He showed that cows' and human 
caseinogen were equally well digested by both pepsin and trypsin, 
but that the pancreatic ferments attack caseinogen rather more 
readily than fibrin, whereas the reverse occurred with the gastric 
ferments, and he concluded that the chief digestion of caseinogen 
probably occurred in the small intestine.

229 



off of the phosphorus from the caseinogen as the result of alkalies 
and digestive enzymes is of interest in this connection. 

The Effect of Heat on Albumin. The albumin of both human 
and cows' milk is affected by heating and coagulates at temperatures 
below that of boiling-point. 

Solomin stated that albumin begins to be coagulated and hence 
precipitated at 60 C., but that it does not coagulate completely 
until the temperature reaches I3o-i40 C. 

Jensen and Plattner carried out elaborate investigations upon 
the temperature of the coagulation of albumin and the extent 
to which this occurred. The general trend of their investigations 
is shown in the following table :

The method employed was to heat the milk to the temperature 
required and subsequently collect the casein by the addition of 
acetic acid. The precipitate thus obtained consisted of all the 
casein plus the coagulated albumin. This gave the figure for the 
casein plus albumin. The figure for the remaining albumin in 
solution was obtained by estimating the protein in the filtrate, 
and the figure for nitrogen in the filtrate shows the residual 
nitrogen after the albumin had been removed. 

In the experiments where the milk was not heated the caseinogen 
was precipitated alone in the cold and the albumin subsequently 
precipitated by heating. The degree of precipitation of albumin 
as a result of heating is shown to some extent in the preceding 
table, but in addition the authors show that the soluble albumin 
was 

Completely precipitated by 5 minutes at 90 C., 
or 30 minutes at 80 C., 
or 60 minutes at 77-5 C. 

When the temperature was raised above 100 C. the nitrogen in 
the filtrate was found to be increased. This effect was produced 
by heating either at 110 C. for half an hour or to 120 C. for from 
five to fifteen minutes. 

It has already been mentioned that the coagulation of caseinogen 



aao MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

does not occur at temperatures below boiling-point, but Jensen 
and Plattner considered that such coagulation does occur when the 
milk is heated for half an hour at 130 C. or for five minutes at 
140 C., and they believe that the brown colour which appears 
in milk when heated to these temperatures is due to a com- 
mencing disintegration of caseinogen. 

Grosser estimated the total nitrogen content of both cows' 
milk and human milk at different temperatures. He removed 
the protein from the milk used by him by passing it through a 
Bechhold filter under pressure of six atmospheres of nitrogen. 1 

It seems certain that when milk is boiled some of the 
albumin is precipitated, but where the same vessel is used for 
storage and feeding purposes, there is no difficulty in maintaining 
the same amount of nitrogen in the food. There is no indication 
that there is any difficulty in the digestion of the coagulated 
albumin ; in fact it is probably more readily digested than in the 
raw state. 

Caseinogen is not coagulated, and such evidence as is avail- 
able tends to show that it is more readily digested after heating than 
before. There would not appear, therefore, to be any disadvantage 
in the heating of milk in relation to the protein portion of this 
food. 

Lactose. There is abundant evidence to show that no altera- 
tion occurs in lactose unless the temperature be raised considerably 
above 100 C., or unless the boiling be carried out for a very prolonged 
period.* 

Fat. Changes in the fat as a result of heating have been investi- 
gated by several observers. 

Jensen and Plattner showed that the fat does not undergo any 
hydrolysis as a result of boiling. 

Woll heated the milk he was investigating in a steriliser for 
several successive days for a period of thirty to thirty-five minutes, 
and found practically no change in the size of the fat globules. 
He obtained, however, some slight decrease in the viscosity in the 
first period of sterilisation and also with pasteurisation for twenty 
minutes at 67 C. When the sterilisation was repeated more than 
once, a slight rise in the viscosity was found to occur. 

Purvis, Brihaut and McHattie found that there was some 
decrease in the fat content when milk was boiled, which amounted 
to approximately 60 per cent, of the total fat, which loss was 
replaced by a gain of 13 per cent, when the milk was sterilised at 
a temperature of Iio-I30 C. They found that less loss occurred 
when the milk was boiled in closed vessels, but the figures obtained 
in the different experiments gave somewhat unequal results. 

Calcium. The calcium content of milk in its raw condition 
has already been considered in Chap. IV, and it is not proposed 

1 See table on p; 232. 

1 Cp. Splittgerber, Jensen and Plattner, and others. 



CHANGES PRODUCED IN MILK BY HEAT 231 

to deal at any length with the changes which occur in the calcium 
content on heating. 

It is a well-established fact that a reduction in the calcium 
content occurs when milk is heated, and this reduction has been 
held responsible for the production of rickets in children who were 
fed upon boiled or otherwise heated milk. The work which has 
been dealt with in the preceding pages 1 shows that there is no 
ground for supposing that rickets is produced by small alterations in 
the calcium content of the milk given. 

The question of alteration in the calcium content is closely 
connected with that of the citric acid content and also with the 
coagulation of caseinogen by rennet. 

It will be simplest first of all to consider the changes in calcium 
content which occur as a result of heating, and subsequently to 
give additional work upon the citric acid content and upon the 
coagulation of milk. 

The work upon calcium belongs to a comparatively early period 
in the investigation of milk. Soldner, in 1888, carried out extensive 
investigations upon the effect of heating milk, and in particular 
upon the effect on the calcium and phosphorus content. He 
found that when milk was just boiled the loss of calcium by 
precipitation amounted to from 13-15 mgms. per 100 c.c. of milk. 
Thus the amount of calcium present in 100 c.c. of raw milk was 

In one case . 80 mgms., falling to 66 on boiling, a loss of 14 mgms. 
In another case 72 59 13 

And in another 62 47 15 

Soldner believed that the calcium was present combined with 
phosphorus as mono- and di-calcium phosphate, which on heating 
passed to the tri-phosphate and was precipitated. He showed 
further that the loss of phosphorus was on similar lines : thus in 
different 100 c.c. samples : 

96 mgms. fell to 86, i.e. a loss of 10 

77 >, 64 13

Boekhout and de Vries found that only from 3-5 mgms. of calcium 
were precipitated from 100 c.c. of milk when the milk was just 
boiled. The variations in the results may perhaps be due to 
peculiarities in the different samples of milk, since these authors 
found that there are some Dutch milks which will not coagulate 
with rennet although they contain normal amounts of calcium. 
Such milks require the addition of a large amount of calcium 
chloride, much of which apparently becomes insoluble, in order to 
produce a coagulation with rennet. 

Grosser has investigated more recently the effect of boiling

upon the calcium and phosphorus content of both human and 
cows' milk. The method employed by him was somewhat different 
from the usual methods of previous observers. He used both 
cows' milk and human milk, but in the former case the cream was 
removed before the manipulations about to be described. In 
human milk this was found not to be necessary. 

The milk was put through a Bechhold filter, working under 
6 atmospheres' pressure of nitrogen. As a result of nitration 
the colloids remain behind and the crystalloids come through. 
Both varieties of milk were examined raw and after boiling for 
five, ten, and thirty minutes. He found, as shown by the following 
table, that greater loss occurred on boiling in human milk than 
in cows' milk, more especially in the case of calcium. The de- 
pression of the freezing-point, which was also investigated, showed 
no appreciable change, as shown in the following table :

The table shows that there is a greater loss in salt content, 
owing to precipitation by boiling, with human milk than with 
cows' milk. 

Using butter milk he obtained no difference between the raw 
and the boiled filtrate, and he suggests that the acidity which has 
developed in the butter milk has split off practically all the 
phosphorus and calcium from the caseinogen. He also suggests 
that this action probaby occurs normally in the stomach. 

It does not seem necessary to quote any further observations, 
as it is generally admitted that there is a less of calcium on heating 
cows' milk, but in view of the higher percentage of this constituent 
in cows' milk than in human milk, it is probable that there is still 
an excess of calcium in cows' milk over human milk even after it 
has been boiled. Moreover, if the milk is boiled and the precipitate 
of calcium subsequently mixed up again in the milk, there need 
not be any loss in the total lime content, although the calcium 
may be present in a rather different form. When milk for infants 
is prepared in a special vessel, as should always be the case, there 
is no difficulty in obtaining the full calcium content in the milk 
even after it has been boiled. 



CHANGES PRODUCED IN MILK BY HEAT 233 

Phosphorus. There is a slight loss of phosphorus when milk 
is heated, which appears to fall out of solution in the form of calcium 
phosphate. 

Thus Solomin found that at 80 C. a little phosphorus falls out, 
and at I30-I40 C. about half the ash of the milk was precipitated, 
including all the calcium phosphate. 

Purvis, Brihaut and McHattie obtained varying results, which 
were further affected by the method of heating. Less loss was 
found if the vessel used was closed. Among their experiments 
they found a loss of phosphorus amounting to n per cent, in milk 
kept at 100 C. for half an hour and 6 per cent, of the total in 
sterilised milk. 1 

On the Question of Citric Acid in Milk, and its Reduction by 
Heating. Many statements have been made in regard to the 
connection between the citric acid in milk, its diminution as a 
result of heating, and the consequent production of scurvy. A 
number of these statements have been entirely unsupported by 
facts, and the connection appears to have been hailed with some 
degree of satisfaction, as affording a possible solution of a difficult 
question. Recently, however, less has been heard of the reduction 
in the amount of citric acid as a result of heating milk, owing 
probably to the generally favourable results which are obtained 
by feeding infants upon boiled or dried cows' milk. 

The discovery of citric acid in cows' milk appears to have been 
first made by Scheibe and Henkel, whose work was communicated 
to a medical society by Soxhlet. These investigators found that 
citric acid was present in cows' milk to the extent of about o-i 
per cent, and that nine-tenths of this total amount appeared to 
be attached to calcium. They were unable to obtain any evidence 
of the presence of citric acid in several samples of human milk 
which were examined by them. They believed that the difference 
between the two milks can be accounted for by the fact that the 
cow is a herbivorous animal. 

Netter (i) states that human milk contains -5 mgm. of citrates 
per litre, while cows' milk contains from two to three times as 
much. 

Obermaier studied the effect of boiling upon the citric acid 
content of cows' milk. He clarified the milk with a variety of 
earth until the filtrate was no longer opalescent. The filtrate 
was then acidified with sulphuric acid to remove the calcium 
from the citric acid. Excess of the sulphuric acid was then removed 
with baryta and the citric acid converted to the barium citrate. 
Evaporation was carried out and the citric acid freed with 
a fresh addition of sulphuric acid. After further methods of 
purification the citric acid was estimated. Obermaier found that 
there was a considerable difference in the amount of citric acid 

1 Cp. also the work just quoted by SSldner and Grosser. 



334 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

present in the different samples of milk, and that it varied from 
1-2 to 2 gms. per litre in raw milk. The loss by heating was 
investigated when milk was boiled on the open fire for five, ten, 
and fifteen minutes respectively. The loss in citrates obtained 
by heating for five minutes varied from I2-29-3I-86 per cent, 
on the total, and from 5-01-2978 per cent, when heated for 
fifteen minutes. When heated for longer periods of half an hour 
an apparent gain occurs which he believed to be due to loss of 
water and increased concentration. The increase, however, shows 
such wide deviations, that it is somewhat difficult to believe that 
sufficient concentration would take place to account for a gain, 
instead of a loss of approximately 30 per cent. When milk was 
heated on the water-bath, the following approximate results were 
obtained : 

Heated for 15 min. at 75 C. gave a loss of 4-13 per cent. 

30 75 C. 3'44 
60 75 C. showed a gain. 

30 100 C. gave a loss varying from 18-30 per cent. 

60 100 C. 17-29 

At higher temperatures, e.g. at 120 C., there was a loss of 22 per 
cent. 

Splittgerber investigated the effect of heat upon various 
substances in milk, notably on the citric acid. He took known 
solutions of mono-, bi-, and tri-calcium citrate, heated these to 
dryness, and then heated further for prolonged periods. He found 
that the tri-citrate heated by this method showed a slight loss of 
approximately I mgm. on 181 after five hours' drying. The mono- 
and bi-citrates showed a slight increase in weight, which he believed 
might be accounted for by the holding of water of crystallisation. 
These results of Splittgerber's are of considerable interest when 
taken in conjunction with the work of several authors upon the 
effect of heating on the calcium content of milk dealt with on 
p. 231. It was there mentioned that the diminution in calcium 
as a result of heating milk was believed to be due to a change from 
mono- or bi-calcium phosphate to the fully saturated form, which last 
becomes insoluble when heated. Splittgerber's work does not sug- 
gest the occurrence of this change in the form of the citrate, although 
this has been suggested by other writers. It is possible, however, 
that the effect of heating in a complex solution such as milk may be 
different from that which occurs when heated in aqueous solution. 

Bosworth and Prucha showed that citric acid disappears from 
milk which has been allowed to go sour. 

The work above described does not suggest that the citric acid 
content of cows' milk as a food for infants is of any great importance. 
Such evidence as there is seems to show that even after boiling 
the content is probably as high as in the infant's natural food 
namely, human milk. Further, the same remarks apply^as for the 



CHANGES PRODUCED IN MILK BY HEAT 335 

calcium that it is not lost, and if heated in a special vessel can 
be obtained by the infant if this is desired. 

The Effect of Heating on the Coagulation by Rennet. The 
effect of heating on the coagulation of caseinogen by rennet has 
been studied by numerous investigators, and it is not proposed 
to deal with many of the papers. 

There is no doubt that the time of coagulation with rennet is 
prolonged by heating. This was mentioned by Soldner (1888) who 
believed that the delay in the coagulation was due to deficiency 
of calcium, the calcium having been thrown out of solution as a 
result of heating. 

Ringer (1890) showed that coagulation of caseinogen can be 
brought about if calcium chloride is added to milk, and that the 
addition of lime salts hastens coagulation by rennet, while their 
reduction delays clotting. 

This was confirmed by Conradi, who showed also that if the milk 
is heated to a temperature of 70 C. before the addition of calcium 
chloride, it will coagulate at a temperature of from 8-12 degrees 
lower than if the calcium is added before heating. The coagula- 
tion with rennet, he believed, was not affected by heating the 
milk for half an hour at 70 C., and was very little delayed by a 
temperature of 75 C. After this temperature the coagulation 
time gradually increases, but coagulation will still occur until the 
temperature has been raised to well above 100 C. (about 110 C.). 
Milk which has been just boiled and then cooled coagulates just as 
well as raw milk. 1 

Kreidl and Lenk investigated the question of rennet coagula- 
tion in heated milk and dealt fully with the literature. These 
authors state that when the milk and all the apparatus concerned 
in the process are sterile, coagulation does not occur, but on the 
least contamination by any unsterilised material, even a finger 
on the top of the test-tube, coagulation occurs. 

Rupp, working on the changes produced in milk as a result 
of heating, found that using low temperatures, i.e. from 55 C. up 
to 65 C., the coagulation with rennet takes place more rapidly 
than was the case with raw milk. Retardation commenced at 
70 C. and at 75 C. The time of coagulation was approximately 
doubled, and the coagulation was of a flocculent character. Similar 
observations were made by Stassano and Talarico some years 
previously. 

Sidler showed that human milk does not coagulate with rennet, 
and generally speaking this is the opinion of later investigators, 
although it appears that human milk does alter somewhat on the 
addition of rennet but does not form into a solid clot. 

There is some evidence to show that the delay in clotting is 
connected both with the falling out of calcium and with the acidity 

1 See Conradi's paper for the early literature} 



236 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

of the milk. It is generally believed by those who have investi- 
gated the question that the acidity of milk falls somewhat as a 
result of heating. This is believed to be due to the passing off of 
carbonic acid as a result of heating. 

Jensen and Plattner found a decrease in the total acidity with 
the employment of moderate heat, and a rise of acidity when the 
temperature rose to 120 C., or even when a temperature of 100 C. 
is employed for a prolonged period. They believe that the fall 
of acidity, which is slow, is due to the giving off of carbon dioxide, 
and they point out that the calcium falls out from solution when 
the acidity has been reduced to the lowest point reached. They 
state, however, that the falling out of the calcium does not always 
occur, and they believe that this depends upon the amount of semi- 
combined carbon dioxide present in the milk, the rise of acidity 
consequent on heating to a high temperature being due to a slight 
disintegration both of the lactose and of the caseinogen. 

Splittgerber found that there was a fall of total acidity when 
the milk was heated for about two hours in a Soxhlet apparatus. 
He pointed out that lactic acid, when present, passes off very readily 
on the application of a low temperature, and appears to suggest 
that the reduction in acidity may be connected with small quantities 
of lactic acid in the milk. In the course of heating it is very likely 
that changes take place in the method of combination of the calcium 
with the phosphorus in the milk, and possibly with the carbon 
dioxide present. The possibility of similar changes has been 
mentioned in connection with the effect of heat upon calcium 
citrate. Any such changes, if they occur, would tend to reduce 
the acidity of the milk and at the same time cause the calcium 
salt to fall out of solution. 

It has been shown above, and it is a well-known fact, that 
reduction in the calcium content of the milk delays the time of 
clotting. The degree of acidity appears also to exercise influence 
upon the time of clotting. Some difficulty has been experienced 
in the making of cheese with boiled or pasteurised milk, owing to 
the delay which occurs in the subsequent process of clotting with 
rennet. Sammis and Bruhny have shown in recent investigations 
upon this subject, that the difficulty can be readily overcome by 
the addition of a small quantity of hydrochloric acid to the milk 
after it has been heated. It seems likely, therefore, that milk, even 
when the coagulation has been indefinitely delayed as a result of 
heating to a high temperature, will undergo coagulation when it 
reaches the stomach. Moreover, there appears to be subtle differ- 
ences between the rennets occurring in the stomachs of different 
animals. Fuld and Noeggerath found, for instance, that the rennet 
obtained from calves and goats showed a greater activity on the 
caseinogen of the same species. It is possible, therefore, that 
although human milk does not clot readily with cows' rennet, 
clotting may occur in the stomach of the human infant. 



CHANGES PRODUCED IN MILK BY HEAT 237 

In any case, it is difficult to attribute a high degree of importance 
to the delay in clotting of cows' milk produced as a result of heating. 
Many of the investigators have brought forward this fact as an 
argument to show the denaturisation of the protein as a result of 
heating, and have straightway deduced from this that some harmful 
effect was probably produced. If, however, it be the case that 
human milk does not form into a solid coagulum in the infant's 
stomach, it seems reasonable to suppose that the soft, flocculent 
coagulum formed in cows' milk which has been heated, will be more 
favourable for the digestion of the human infant than the solid 
clot formed with raw milk. 

The Biological Properties of Milk. Ferments. The work of 
numerous authors, already detailed in Chap. V, shows the very 
small importance, if any, of the ferments which are normally 
present in milk. It is unnecessary, therefore, to deal with any 
possible loss of nutritive or biological properties which might occur 
in a milk as a result of the destruction of the enzyme content by 
heat. Where the initial value is negligible, a reduction in value 
cannot be regarded as occurring. 

On the Effect of Heat upon the Properties concerned with the 
Production of Immunity. The work which has been considered 
in Chap. VI has afforded evidence as to the direct absorption 
of native protein (with such properties as may be attached to the 
molecule), in the early days of life. Some absorption of ' foreign ' 
protein seems also to occur, but only in small amounts ; more- 
over, there is some reason to suppose that such absorption may 
not be beneficial to the suckling animal. There can be no doubt 
that the natural food is of the greatest importance in the early 
days of life, and such food would be subjected to heat, only in 
special circumstances, which have been considered in Chap. IX. 

The clinical results obtained by the use of heated cows' milk 1 
for infants render a consideration of the effect of heat upon 
the so-called ' protective substances ' of academic interest only ; 
especially in view of the fact that such properties are destroyed 
by digestion. In spite of these practical considerations, there has 
been some amount of discussion in regard to the so-called 'dena- 
turisation ' of the milk protein by heat. It has been asserted that 
if the precise temperature at which such a process occurred could 
be ascertained, it might be permissible to heat the cows' milk used 
for artificially-fed children to just below that temperature. Such 
arguments have little weight, and have presumably been advanced 
without adequate consideration of the processes of digestion. It 
is a matter of common physiological knowledge that proteins are 
broken down to their simpler groupings before absorption. These 
groupings have no ' biological ' properties, and have been shown 
to be capable, when given by the mouth, of supplying the needs 

See Chap. Xli 



238 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

of the body in the same manner as the protein molecules from 
which they were derived. 

Such experimental work as has been carried out has, for the 
most part, been concerned with the forensic or legal side of the 
question. The object has been to determine a method either for 
differentiation of raw and boiled milk, or for the detection of pro- 
teins of different species. For this purpose the methods which have 
been considered in Chap. Ill have been employed, based upon the 
production of anti-sera by the injection of raw or heated milk. 

There is some lack of uniformity in the results obtained, much of 
which can probably be explained by the different methods used. 
In the early investigations no differentiation of the antigens was 
made, the whole milk being injected. It was shown in Chap. Ill 
that such a method will produce a complex result since several 
different antigens are injected, each producing its own effect. 

Further, in the preceding pages it has been shown that heat 
reduces the amount of soluble albumin. Hence when milk is 
heated before injection the amount of soluble antigen which will 
be injected will be reduced, and the degree of reduction will vary 
with the duration of the period of application of heat before in- 
jection. 

Caseinogen is not so readily affected by heat, although this 
occurs when high temperatures are used. 

A number of the investigations upon the effect of heat on the 
antigens of milk have been concerned with milk which had been 
boiled for prolonged periods frequently for half an hour or 
raised to temperatures above the boiling-point of water. In these 
circumstances there will be a decrease, or even perhaps an absence, 
of soluble albumin in the fluid injected. 

No experiments appear to have been performed with heated 
albumin alone, and it is impossible to ascertain from the original 
papers whether the precipitated albumin was used in the injection 
or not. In view of the differences in the methods of heating, it is 
likely that in some cases the albumin remained in the vessel, and 
in others where the milk was only just boiled that the albumin 
was present in the injected fluid. 

Some observers who have used the precipitin reaction, have 
concluded that the divergent results were attributable to the 
variation in the calcium content occasioned by heating the milk. 

The results obtained by different observers are shown in the 
table on p. 239. 

Bauer (1910) found that caseinogen as an antigen was not 
affected by being boiled, and regarded the effect of heat upon the 
antigens in milk as attributable to the effect on the albumin. This 
view is confirmed by the work of Rudicke and Sachs, who found 
that a lacto-serum produced by injecting milk which had been 
boiled for half an hour, did not react with the homologous serum 
although it did react with the homologous milk. It will be

remembered that caseinogen has been shown to be a substance 
apart from the blood-proteins. 1 

As a general conclusion it may be stated that antigens are not 
affected by just boiling milk, but that some effect is produced when 
the heating is prolonged. In this connection the observations of 
Dele'pine on the temperature reached in the process of drying milk 
are of considerable interest. 1 

On the Presence of further Substances in Milk concerned in 
the Nutrition of the Organism. The work of several authors 
indicates that there are in milk several substances which are of 
great importance for the adequate development of the organism. 
These investigations have been carried out for the most part upon 
adult animals which have been deprived of one or other of their 
normal food-stuffs. The results are somewhat fragmentary from 
the present point of view, but cannot be entirely omitted. 

The earliest work was that of Stepp, who fed mice upon food 
which had been previously treated with alcohol and ether to remove 
the lipoids. He found that mice fed upon this food as the sole 
diet oUd not survive very long. If, however, a small quantity of 
milk was added to the dietary no detrimental effect was observed. 
The minimum amount of milk was given which was able to keep the 
animals alive. Stepp found that rather more boiled milk had to be 
given than raw milk in order to ensure the survival of the animals. 

The work of Hopkins upon rats showed that where an insufficient 
dietary was given, the addition of minute quantities of milk caused 
a most striking difference in the rate of growth of the animals. 
No work was carried out with heated milk, so that these experiments 
are somewhat outside the scope of the present chapter. 

Funk (i, 2, 4) in his investigations upon the deficiency diseases 
believed that he had obtained evidence of the presence of a non- 
phosphorus-containing compound which was necessary for the life of 
the animal. This substance was termed by him vitamine, and was 
isolated by him from samples of dried milk. Funk (3) alleged that 
this substance was destroyed by boiling, but the evidence in support 
of this statement is indefinite and cannot be regarded as conclusive. 
Moreover, the substance prepared by Funk is now very generally 
believed to be a mixture of several substances, so that much stress 
cannot at the present time be laid upon this work. There seems 
little doubt that milk does contain substances of (at present) unknown 
composition which are essential for the life of the animal where 
milk is the sole dietary, but there is no evidence to show that 
these substances are destroyed by boiling, especially when the 
heat is not applied for prolonged periods and when a temperature 
not exceeding boiling-point is used. The work of Stepp suggests 
that there may be some loss of ' vitamine ' as a result of boiling 
milk. This loss, however, if it occurs, is evidently not sufficient 
to affect the nutritive value of milk for infants, as has been 
abundantly shown in the preceding chapters. 

1 Cp. Chap. III. l Cp. Appendix F. 



CHANGES PRODUCED IN MILK BY HEAT 241 

If a reduction in ' vitamine ' does occur, it would only be 
detected clinically when the amount fell below the minimal physio- 
logical needs of the infant, and it is unlikely, either that the average 
infant receives the minimal amount of milk or that the ' vitamine ' 
content of milk is minimal. The content of the other constituents 
of milk varies within fairly wide limits, and there is no reason to 
suppose the ' vitamine ' would occupy any different position in 
this respect. Hence, experiments such as those just quoted, 
although of great interest, have only an indirect bearing upon the 
hygienic and nutritional aspects of infant feeding, even where 
milk is the sole diet.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER XV 

ON THE PRESENCE IN MILK OF CERTAIN ORGANISMS LIABLE TO 
CAUSE DISEASE, WITH NOTES ON MILK-BORNE EPIDEMICS 

IT is not intended here to accord any general consideration to 
microbial diseases of the udder, but certain affections of this organ, 
which can be classified together under the term mastitis or in- 
flammatory conditions of the udder, are sufficiently common to 
call for a short consideration. 

Mastitis may be either chronic or acute. It may be caused 
by the presence of streptococci or of tubercle bacilli in the udder. 
It has been shown in Chap. VII that the presence of streptococci 
in milk cannot necessarily be regarded as pathological even when 
present in milk obtained direct from the udder. Streptococci can 
be found nearly everywhere, and have been shown to be present 
on the outside of the udder and on the skin of the cow and to gain 
access to the milk directly from this position. It is also possible 
that they may find their way some distance up the teat and thus 
be passed out with the first portions of milk. 

There is no doubt that a large number of cases of mastitis are 
due to infection by streptococci. How far such strains of strepto- 
cocci may be pathogenic for the human species has not as yet been 
accurately determined, and it is likely that such a determination is 
hardly possible. Much time and labour have been expended by 
numerous observers in the endeavour to classify streptoccoci into 
pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. These efforts cannot, 
however, be regarded as having been crowned with success. There 
is evidence to show that a strain of streptococcus, which may be 
apparently harmless, may become virulent as a result of being 
grown upon different media, more especially by passage through 
the animal organism. 1 

Examination of the general milk supply in a number of towns 
has shown the wide prevalence of streptococci in samples of market 
milk. In several cases where pathogenicity of these organisms was 
tested on the lower animals a number of such strains were found 

1 Cp. Heine man n and others. 
244 



THE PRESENCE IN MILK OF CERTAIN ORGANISMS 245 

to be non-pathogenic, while others were found to be virulent. No 
cultural characteristics appear to afford a definite distinction 
between the virulent and the non-virulent strains. 

It is probable that a number of the strains of these bacteria give 
rise to no symptoms when taken into the animal organism by the 
mouth. There is, however, abundant evidence to show that some 
strains have a high degree of virulence for human beings, and that 
many epidemics, generally of sore throats, have been produced 
by drinking milk containing such streptococci. The history of 
the epidemics which occurred in America, and were fully investi- 
gated, in the years 1911-12, leaves no doubt on this matter, and 
the epidemics recorded in our own country afford evidence in support 
of these facts. 

Tubercle Bacilli. There is no need at the present day to bring 
forward evidence in regard to the presence of bovine tubercle 
bacilli in milk. Its occurrence in a large number of samples of the 
general milk supply has been demonstrated beyond doubt both 
in this and in other countries. Further, there can be no reasonable 
doubt that such bacilli of bovine origin are pathogenic to young 
children. The findings both of the Royal Commission on Tuber- 
culosis and of other observers show that children suffer from disease 
caused by the tubercle bacillus obtained from cattle, and that the 
percentage of tubercular disease in children which is caused by the 
bovine tubercle bacillus is high. On the other hand, the percentage 
of this disease caused by the bovine tubercle bacillus in adults is 
very low. 

Investigations have shown that the bacilli, when taken in with 
food, can pass through the walls of the alimentary canal and reach 
the neighbouring glands, where they develop and spread to further 
parts of the glandular system and to other organs, ultimately 
causing generalised tuberculosis. It has been shown that the main 
source of infection by bovine tubercle bacilli must be by means of 
milk which contains these organisms. The argument that if 
these organisms are harmless, or comparatively so, to adults, they 
are not harmful to children, cannot be regarded as having any 
weight. It is well known that children are susceptible to patho- 
genic influences which leave an adult unaffected. 

Other Organisms. Other organisms occur in milk when the 
cow or other animal supplying the milk is suffering from disease 
caused by such organisms. Thus, cows which have been infected 
by the Bacillus abortus continue to excrete these organisms for 
prolonged periods after such infection has occurred. The organisms 
are also passed out in the milk, in many cases before evidence of the 
infection by this organism has been demonstrated clinically. 

A consideration of the presence of the organism of Malta fever 
in the milk of goats is beyond the scope of this work, but is in- 
teresting in view of the analogy which it presents to the conditions 
here under review. 



346 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



CHAPTER XV 

ON THE PRESENCE IN MILK OF CERTAIN ORGANISMS LIABLE TO 
CAUSE DISEASE, WITH NOTES ON MILK-BORNE EPIDEMICS 

A. On the Presence of Streptococci in Milk. The occurrence of 
streptococci in milk has been already mentioned in Chap. VII, 
when their possible connection with a high cell count was 
discussed. It is necessary here to consider the prevalence of these 
organisms, and to determine, if possible, whether, when present, 
they must be regarded as harmful or if their presence may be 
neglected. 

Prevalence of Streptococci. Numerous investigators have 
examined large numbers of samples of milk in different towns for 
the presence of streptococci. Speaking generally, it may be said 
that wherever such systematic examination has been carried out, 
a high percentage of the samples examined have been shown to 
contain streptococci. 

Bergey found that 80 per cent, of the samples of market milk 
investigated by him contained streptococci. In milk obtained 
from four of the best dairies streptococci were absent in all the 
samples examined from two of the farms, and present in 6-25 per 
cent, and 28-57 per cent, respectively of the samples from the 
remaining farms. 

Briming examined the market milk in Leipzig, and showed 
that 93 per cent, of all the samples taken showed streptococci. 
These streptococci did not present the same characteristics, but 
could be roughly classed under two headings : 

1. Those which were gram-positive, thick in appearance, and 
formed in short chains ; 

2. Those which were gram-negative and arranged in diplococcic 
order. 

Kaiser examined the milk in Gratz, and found that in the period 
from November 22, 1904, to June 27, 1905, 76-6 per cent, of all 
the samples examined contained streptococci. 

Campbell, working in Philadelphia in 1909 in connection with 
the enumeration of leucocytes, found streptococci present in all 
the samples of market milk examined (twenty). 

Ernst, working in Munich, stated in 1909 that in 1840 samples 
examined by him, all contained streptococci. 

Savage demonstrated the presence of streptococci in 47 per 
cent, of the samples of milk examined by him, when the centri- 
fugalised deposit was brushed over agar plates. In eleven samples 



THE PRESENCE IN MILK OF CERTAIN ORGANISMS 247 

of milk obtained fresh from the farm and examined withH three 
hours, streptococci were found in all. 

It is not necessary to adduce further evidence to show that 
streptococci are widely distributed in the milk supply of most 
countries. 

The sources of the organism have been studied by numerous 
observers, and it has been shown that streptococci can be obtained 
from the udder, mouth, faeces, and milk of the cow, 1 and that they 
are found on the human body * and in numerous other localities. 
Roger found that most of the varieties of streptococci present in 
the milk were derived from the udder of the cow. 

It has long been known that there are many different varieties 
of streptococci, and numerous efforts have been made to classify 
them as pathogenic or non-pathogenic, according to the appearance 
and cultural properties of the different strains. 

Streptococci are responsible for a number of diseases or affections 
in man, and for a large proportion of the cases of mastitis, or 
inflammation of the udder, in cows. It is clearly important to 
determine whether the streptococci found so generally in milk, 
are liable to produce disease in those who consume the milk. 

With this object prolonged investigations have been carried 
oit upon the pathogenicity or otherwise of the strain of streptococci 
found in milk, and also those obtained from the sufferers in milk- 
borne epidemics of sore throat. 

The classification of streptococci found in milk in relation 
to their cultural properties cannot be regarded as having been very 
successful. 

Savage endeavoured to classify them according to the lines 
suggested by Gordon, but without success. 

Muller, who investigated the streptococci found by Kaiser in 
his investigations in Gratz, believed that there was a close relation- 
ship between the streptococci found in milk and those which are 
pathogenic to animals. Of the strains examined, three appeared 
to be identical with the pathogenic varieties, and produced 
haemolysis of red corpuscles when cultured. 

Ruediger considers it possible to differentiate the Streptococcus 
commonly found in milk from the Streptococcus pyogenes, by 
means of blood agar plates. He believes that the Streptococcus 
lacticus has no sanitary significance. The Streptococcus pyogenes 
does not occur commonly in milk, but when found it denotes 
an inflammatory condition of the cow's udder. Thirty-five strains 
were examined. 

Heinemann (i), however, considers that the Bacillus acidi lactici 
is in reality the Streptococcus lacticus, and that it agrees in cultural 
and coagulative properties with the pathogenic streptococci obtained 
from sewage and faeces. The Streptococcus lacticus was found by 

1 Cp. Roger. Cp. Zangmeister. 



248 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

him in all the samples examined and in all stages of handling of 
the milk. 

Heinemann (2) also found that Streptococcus lacticus becomes 
more virulent by passage through rabbits, and after five passages 
may become equal in virulence to Streptococcus pyogenes. The 
same culture, after it had been increased in virulence by passage, 
proved fatal to an animal, which showed no symptoms on being 
inoculated with a dose of the same strain before passage. 

More definite results have been obtained by studying the 
appearance of the organisms. 

The chain formation has been shown to have variable 
characteristics. Some samples have long chains, others short 
chains, and : in J some cases an ill-defined capsule is present. The 
long and short chain varieties are shown in the accompanying plate. 
(See Plate II.) 

Ernst believes that with experience it is possible to determine 
the presence of the pathogenic]; varieties of streptococci with a high 
degree of certainty. He says : ' The streptococcus acquires a 
diplococcic ^formation, the cocci appear to press one another, 
become disc-shaped, and appear linear in profile. They lie on a 
different axis from that of the chain. A more or less pronounced 
capsule is formed around the streptococci of " animal " origin, 
which may expand to a broad mucin capsule.' The presence of this 
variety is regarded by Ernst as denoting mastitis. (Cp. Plate IIL) 

Trommsdorff agrees with Ernst, and thinks that in the early 
stages of mastitis j^the short diplococcic forms are found in the 
sediment, passing to the long chain formation in later stages. 

Gminder also showed that the streptococci appearing in mflk 
when mastitis is present appear rather to have the form of flattened 
diplococci than of the usual chain. These characteristics may, 
however, also be shown by saprophytic strains outside the organism. 
Saprophytic forms, when injected into the udder, tend to become 
pathogenic. No precise morphological characteristics in the two 
varieties were determined, but Gminder considers that where a 
milk sediment is found to contain streptococci showing the peculiar 
form above mentioned, further investigations should be carried 
out. He considered that there was no connection between the 
virulence of the strain and the production of haemolysis. 

Similar appearances in the streptococcic formations were 
found by Rosenow and Davis, in connection with a milk-borne 
epidemic in Chicago, and by Hamburger in Baltimore. 

Rosenow and Davis found that the streptococci which were 
isolated from this epidemic showed a weak capsular substance 
surrounding the streptococci. The capsule was not indented and 
was lost on culturing. The strains were pathogenic to mice and 
rabbits, killing them within twelve to twenty-four hours. Virulence 
was increased by passage, as was also the definition of the capsular 
substances.

THE PRESENCE IN MILK OF CERTAIN ORGANISMS 249 

Hamburger found that the organisms were arranged in the 
form of diplococci with a sort of halo, which did not however stain 
with any of the capsular stains. The diplococci were placed end to end, 
and when grown on milk these organisms showed chain formation. 

Further work on similar lines has been carried out by H oiling, 
Puppel, Stowell and Hilliard, and others. 1 

There seems little doubt that streptococci are present in the 
milk of cows which cannot be regarded as other than healthy. 
Moreover, these organisms occur when the milk is collected with 
the strictest aseptic precautions, as is the case with ' certified ' * 
milk, as given below. 

Heinemann obtained ' certified ' milk and allowed it to stand 
for eight days to become sour. He then investigated the milk 
for streptococci and found these organisms present in all dilutions 
used, both at room temperature and at 37 C. He then took 10 
litres of this milk and divided it equally into forty-two flasks. Of 
the forty-two flasks thirty-eight were heated in a steam steriliser 
for three successive days. All except one of the flasks which had 
been heated were then inoculated with streptococci obtained from 
numerous sources, namely, human faeces, cow fasces, milk, separator 
slime, sewage, etc. He found that all these strains when grown 
in milk tended to develop the characteristic diplococci and their 
chain formation. 

Rosenow obtained milk with a milking-tube from twelve 
apparently healthy cows. Five of the samples were sterile. Of 
the other seven, three showed large numbers of streptococci after 
incubation, and of these two varieties were found to be virulent on 
injection. He found that streptococci, when grown in milk, take on 
the characteristics of those found in epidemic sore-throats. The 
greatest effect is produced when the organisms are grown in unheated 
milk, less being produced when grown in pasteurised milk, and 
little or none when the milk has been heated in the autoclave. He 
also investigated a large number of streptococci obtained from 
milk and from epidemic sore-throats. Slime was obtained from 
the milk of known farms, and was subjected to a process of 
cleansing in a special clarifying machine. He also used the sediment 
obtained from a cream separator. Immense numbers of strepto- 
cocci and other bacteria, also of leucocytes and foreign matter, 
were found in the material obtained from both sources. Emulsions 
of the organisms which were made and injected into animals were 
found to be highly pathogenic, the animals dying within three days. 
Virulent cultures of streptococci were obtained from the exudate 
or from the blood in thirteen out of fifteen animals examined. 
A pseudodiphtheria bacillus was the next commonest organism found 
in the investigation. 

1 Cp. also work by Rosenow and Moon, and by Krumwiede and Valen- 
tine, published since the above was written. 

For explanation of the term ' certified,' see p. 271. 



250 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

The investigation of samples of cream obtained in the open 
market showed the presence of virulent streptococci. The cream 
used was stated to have been pasteurised by the ' flash method.' 1 

B. Tubercle Bacilli in Milk. The literature upon tuberculosis 
in cattle, and in milk, and its relationship to disease can only be 
described as voluminous, and any detailed consideration of the 
subject would be outside the scope of the present work. It is 
proposed to present only such aspects of the question as appear to 
be inseparably connected with any consideration of the hygienic 
aspect of milk. The literature dealing with the regulations for 
controlling tuberculosis in cattle, and with the clinical signs of 
tuberculosis in cows will be entirely omitted. The points which 
will be considered are (i) the presence of tubercle bacilli in milk, 
with an attempt to show their relative prevalence in milk samples 
and in milking cows, and (2) the connection between the presence 
of the bacilli in milk and the health of children. 

i. The General Prevalence of Tubercle Bacilli in Milk Samples 
in certain Large Cities. The incidence of tubercle bacilli in milk 
samples has now been investigated in the milk supply of a number of 
cities, and the results have been published. It is not necessary to 
examine a large number of the results obtained in the course of such 
enquiries, since the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in one country 
does not afford any guide as to the prevalence of tuberculosis in 
another. Only a few enquiries will therefore be considered. 

The Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council has 
reported upon the presence of tubercle bacilli in milk samples 
which had been examined under the auspices of this Council. He 
states that between the date of the coming into force of the 
L.C.C. General Powers Act of 1907 and December 1913, 13,321 
samples of milk forwarded from places outside the county had been 
examined for the presence of tubercle bacilli. Of these, 1323 
samples, or 9-9 per cent., had been found to contain tubercle bacilli, 
as shown by the inoculation of guinea-pigs. During the year 
1913, 2900 samples had been examined. Of these the examination 
of 2682 was complete at the time of writing his report, of which 
251, or 9-3 per cent., had been shown to contain tubercle bacilli. 

The presence of tubercle bacilli has been investigated on several 
occasions in the market milk of New York. In 1909 Hess found 
the incidence of tubercle bacilli to be about 16 per cent, of all the 
samples examined by him, and in 1912-13 Grund and Wilcox found 
that 9 out of 78 samples of milk examined, or 11*5 per cent., 
were positive. 

Eastwood, in his investigations on the American milk supply, 
obtained figures relating to the number of infected cows in North 
Wisconsin in the years 1905-8. Out of 23,351 cows tested with tuber- 
culin, 781, or 3-5 per cent, of all investigated, showed a positive 
reaction. These cows belonged to 1586 different herds, of which 
1 For explanation see p. 229. 



THE PRESENCE IN MILK OF CERTAIN ORGANISMS 251 

number 88, or 17 per cent, of all the herds, contained infected cows. 
In the southern part of Wisconsin State, which had been settled for a 
longer period than the other parts and which has a denser popula- 
tion, 43,176 cows had been examined. Of these animals 4570, 
or 10 -5 per cent., gave a positive reaction. The cows belonged 
to 2164 different herds, of which 941, or 43-4 per cent, of all the 
herds, contained infected animals. 

The difference in the rate of incidence of tuberculosis in the 
cattle of the two portions of the state is very striking. 

Campbell, in 1909, investigated the presence of tubercle bacilli in 
the general milk supply of Philadelphia. He took 130 samples 
of market milk and found that 18 contained tubercle bacilli. 
Seven of the inoculated guinea-pigs died before they could be ex- 
amined for tuberculosis, but excluding these the precentage of positive 
samples was 13-8. Samples of milk sold as pasteurised milk were 
also examined, and of these 8-3 per cent, gave positive results. This 
fact shows the unreliability of pasteurisation in procuring a safe 
milk supply. This point is considered further in Chap. XIX. 

Delepine, dealing with the milk supply of Manchester between 
the years 1897 and 1913, examined 7681 samples of milk, of which 
671 were found to contain tubercle bacilli, or 8-7 per cent, of the 
total. The figures given show that there had been a considerable 
fall in the percentage of positive samples since the commencement 
of the investigation, the percentage for the first two years having 
been 17-2 per cent. 

These figures apply only to milk samples and do not give any 
indication of the number of individual cows giving tuberculous 
milk. Delepine points out that one cow giving tuberculous milk 
can infect a much greater quantity of milk than her own, when the 
milk from several cows is mixed together. In one experiment he 
took some milk from a cow whose udder was in a state of advanced 
tuberculous mastitis, and diluted it with various quantities of cows' 
milk which contained no tubercle bacilli. The mixed milk of 
various dilutions was inoculated into different guinea-pigs, and the 
results showed that one part of the tuberculous milk was capable 
of infecting 100,000 parts of non-tuberculous milk. Delepine 
adds that had the dilution been pushed further it is probable that 
the milk would have been found capable of infecting 1,000,000 
parts of non-tuberculous milk. Evidently, therefore, the samples 
of tuberculous milk give no indication of the absolute number of 
infected cows. 

Delepine gives figures for the number of farms upon which 
tuberculous cows were found, and from which milk was supplied to 
Manchester during the years 1896 to 1913. The average number 
of farms containing infected cows for the whole period was found 
to be 10 '4 per cent., the figures varying from 16-8 per cent, in the 
first four years to 6-3 per cent, in one of the later years. The figures 
showed a marked tendency to fall up to the year 1910, since when 



252 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

there seems to have been a rise in the percentage of farms from 
which infected milk was obtained. 

Dele"pine traced the source of tubercle bacilli in a large 
number of samples of milk and obtained the following results : 

Per cent! 

1. Tuberculous udders the cause of infection in . .78-6 

2. Tuberculous udders probably the cause of infection 

in 16-0 

3. Nothing definite to connect infection with the 

state of the cow in . . . . . .5-2 

These figures were obtained after investigating the milk from 
276 farms. 

Tubercle bacilli have been shown to occur in milk from cows 
in whose udder no tuberculous lesion could be detected. This 
fact is now very generally recognised, but an interesting case is 
quoted by Detepine as showing the difficulty of detecting early 
tuberculous lesions of the udder by inspection and palpation 
alone. This was a case where mixed milk from three farms 
was found to be tuberculous. All three farms were inspected, 
but no cow having a tuberculous udder could be detected. Mixed 
milk of the three farms was again tested and still found to be 
tuberculous. The veterinary surgeon again inspected the farms, 
and after lengthy examination discovered in each a cow showing 
slight signs of disease of the udder, but in none were the symptoms 
at all typical of tuberculosis. Samples of milk taken from each 
of these cows all produced tuberculosis in experimental animals. 
Further cases on the same lines are also quoted by him. 

Mitchell (i) investigated the presence of tubercle bacilli in 
mixed milk obtained from milk shops in Edinburgh between 
November 1913 and May 1914. Four hundred and six samples 
were tested, of which 82, or 20 per cent., were found to be capable 
of producing tuberculosis when inoculated into guinea-pigs. 

Mitchell gives a table showing the occurrence of tuberculosis 
among the Edinburgh dairy cows, compiled from the medical 
officer's reports from 1900-13. These figures afford sufficient evidence 
to show that tuberculosis is widespread among cows generally. 

The source of the bacilli in milk need not necessarily be the 
cow. Evidently they can also be derived from milkers suffering 
from tuberculosis, who, as a result of dirty or careless milking, 
contaminate the milk with the tubercle bacilli in their own saliva. It 
seems, however, that in the majority of instances the tubercle bacilli 
found in milk are derived from the cow herself, a conclusion which is 
confirmed by the figures obtained by Dele*pine, and quoted above. 1 

1 Tubercle bacilli cannot be entirely excluded even from milk of the 
high quality of ' certified ' milk. Helmholtz states that wnere the precautions 
required for the production of this grade of milk have been fulfilled, virulent 
tubercle bacilli have been found in the milk. Cp. also the work of Heine-

The Royal Commission on Tuberculosis, as a result of the 
evidence obtained by them, state : ' Bovine tubercle bacilli are 
apt to be abundantly present in milk as sold to the public when 
there is tuberculous disease of the udder of the cow from which 
it was obtained . . . but these bacilli may also be present in the 
milk of tuberculous cows presenting no evidence whatever of 
disease of the udder, even when examined post-mortem. Further, 
the milk of tuberculous cows not containing bacilli as it leaves 
the udder may, and frequently does, become contaminated with 
the faeces or uterine discharges of such diseased animals.' 

2. On the Infectivity of Tuberculous Milk The importance 
of ascertaining the presence of tubercle bacilli in milk is essentially 
bound up with the question of whether such bacilli can produce 
tuberculous lesions in the human species. Here again the literature 
is voluminous and highly controversial, and it is not proposed to 
deal with it in this work. It will suffice to quote some of the 
results obtained by the extended investigations which have been 
carried out by competent authorities. 

It has been known for a number of years that certain differences 
exist between the tubercle bacilli found in cattle and those found 
in the human species. These have been fully investigated, and 
for further details any one interested is referred to the report of 
the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis. The essential point 
is the presence of bovine tubercle bacilli in lesions in the human 
subject. The most extensive observations have been carried out 
by the workers for the Royal Commission, and it will be of interest 
to quote sentences from the report made by the Commissioners. 
After dealing with the investigations which were conducted upon 
108 cases of human tuberculosis in persons of various ages, the 
Commissioners say : ' Of the total 108 cases of human tuberculosis 
investigated, 84 yielded human tubercle bacilli, only 19 yielded 
bovine tubercle bacilli, and 5 both bovine and human tubercle 
bacilli. Although the bovine tubercle bacilli may, as it appears, 
be solely responsible for certain cases of pulmonary tuberculosis 
(consumption), and though it may be present with the human 
tubercle bacillus in the bronchial glands, it is evident from the 
data recorded that the majority of cases in which the bovine tubercle 
bacillus is the infective agent in the human being are cases of 
alimentary tuberculosis. Such are cases of cervical gland and 
primary abdominal tuberculosis. In the latter class of cases at 
least the tubercle bacillus has unquestionably been swallowed. . . . 
The percentage of these cases of alimentary tuberculosis due to the 
bovine tubercle bacillus is very large.' (The percentage appears 
to be about 50 per cent.) 

It is not necessary to bring forward evidence to show that 
bovine tubercle bacilli affect young children rather than adults. 
The prevalence of gland infection in children and of pulmonary 
infection in adults is a matter of common medical knowledge. 



254 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

Experiments were conducted by the Commission in which 
large numbers of animals were fed upon bovine tubercle bacilli. 
The animals thus fed showed infection of the mesenteric glands 
in nearly every case, and in several cases also of other glands 
more distant from the alimentary canal, and also infection of some 
of the organs, especially the liver and spleen. In one or two cases 
the lungs were also infected. Evidently the bacilli had found 
entrance through the alimentary canal by passing through the 
mucous membrane and then to the glands. 

Dealing further with this subject, the Commissioners state: 
' Of young children dying from primary abdominal tuberculosis, 
the fatal lesions could in nearly one-half of the cases be referred 
to the bovine bacillus, and to that type alone. In children, too, 
and often also in adolescents, suffering from cervical gland tuber- 
culosis, a large proportion of the cases examined by us could be 
referred to the bovine tubercle bacillus. . . . Whatever, there- 
fore, may be the animal source of tuberculosis in adolescents and 
in adult man, there can be no doubt that a considerable proportion 
of the tuberculosis affecting children is of bovine origin, more 
particularly that which affects primarily the abdominal organs 
and the cervical glands. And further, there can be no doubt that 
primary abdominal tuberculosis, as well as tuberculosis of the 
cervical glands, is commonly due to ingestion of tuberculous in- 
fective material. Judging by our feeding experiments, there would 
appear to be strong presumption that as regards most animals, 
comparatively large doses, given either singly or by frequent 
repetition, are necessary to produce by ingestion acute progressive 
generalised tuberculosis, though we have recorded instances in 
which a very small dose administered but once has produced this 
result. Applying a like presumption to man (and our observations 
on the monkey and chimpanzee in this connection afford warrant 
for so doing), it may be asked in what way are children, the members 
of the human family who are especially liable to exhibit acute 
fatal tuberculosis commencing as an abdominal affection, most 
likely to obtain a large and fatally infective dose of tubercle bacilli ? 

'As already indicated by us, to this question there can be 
but one answer namely, that the evidence which we have accu- 
mulated goes to demonstrate that a considerable amount of the 
tuberculosis of childhood is to be ascribed to infection with bacilli 
of the bovine type transmitted to children in meals consisting 
largely of the milk of the cow. 

' In many cases of abdominal tuberculosis and in tuberculosis 
of the cervical glands, however, it must be recollected that the 
child may be injured by the ingestion of bovine tubercle bacilli 
in milk without a fatal result occurring. The cases of abdominal 
tuberculosis examined by us had all been fatal, that is, death occurred 
from a generalised tuberculosis or from some local condition resulting, 
with possibly two exceptions, from tuberculosis of the abdomen. 



THE PRESENCE IN MILK OF CERTAIN ORGANISMS 255 

But many cases of abdominal tuberculosis in children recover, 
though what proportion of these is due to the bovine bacillus 
and what to the human, we have no means of knowing at present. 
The cases of cervical gland tuberculosis investigated by us were 
all cases that recovered or were recovering after operation, and a 
large proportion of them were bovine in origin. . . . We are con- 
vinced that measures for securing the prevention of ingestion of 
living bovine tubercle bacilli with milk would greatly reduce the 
number of cases of abdominal and cervical gland tuberculosis in 
children, and that such measures should include the exclusion from 
the food supply of the milk of the recognisably tuberculous cow 
irrespective of the site of the disease, whether in the udder or in 
the internal organs.' 

Investigations together with summaries of other cases in- 
vestigated by different authors have been prepared by Park and 
Krumwiede. These authors have worked up the percentage of 
bovine infections occurring in children who were found to be 
affected with tubercle, causing their death, or who had died from 
other causes, and were found post-mortem to contain also tuber- 
culous lesions. The table given below is taken from their paper 
and gives the incidence of infection only.

The authors state : ' In our own series of non-selected fatal 
cases under five years of age bovine infection constituted I2| per 
cent. We had nine cases under six years of age, who were ex- 
clusively cow's milk fed, from a foundling asylum. Of these, 
five were bovine infections. If the fatal cases in this series are 
deducted from the total cases, the bovine infections comprise 
about 10 per cent. In a non-selected series of fatal cases from 
the Babies' Hospital 6 per cent, were due to bovine infection. 



256 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

' Where other investigators have reported non-selected cases 
the percentages come close to these figures. 

' On the whole, bovine infection causes somewhat less than 
10 per cent, of the total deaths in young children.' 

Mitchell (2) examined eighty consecutive cases of tuberculous 
cervical glands in children. Of these eighty children forty-two 
resided in Edinburgh and thirty-eight came from the neighbouring 
country districts. The bovine bacillus was present in 88 per cent. 
of the cases and the human bacillus in 12 per cent. Mitchell 
states that ' without exception the cases were those of children 
twelve years of age and under. The maximum incidence occurred 
during the second year of life. This is not surprising when it 
is recalled that the large majority of children of this age are nourished 
in whole or in part on cows' milk. I found that in my series of 
cases 84 per cent, of the children of two years and under had been 
fed with unsterilised cows' milk since birth. Whatever may be 
the case in other countries the mode of feeding children in Britain, 
especially Scotland, is such as to favour bovine infection.' 

The method of feeding of children showing lesions due to bovine 
tubercle bacilli, has been investigated by Fraser. Out of seventy 
cases of tuberculosis of bones or joints thirty-eight cases had a 
clear history of feeding on cows' milk, and the bacteriological 
results suggested infection by bacilli of bovine origin. In nineteen 
of the cases the children were breast-fed, and the evidence was 
in favour of infection with bacilli of human origin. In thirteen 
cases the evidence was either incomplete or showed apparent 
contradiction between the bacteriological findings and the history. 

The question of infection in children by the ingestion of bovine 
tubercle bacilli in milk was thoroughly discussed at the conference 
on tuberculosis which took place in Edinburgh in 1914, at which 
conference some of the results above described were given by the 
authors concerned. 

Stiles, in dealing with the question, reviewed some of the work 
of the observers already mentioned, and urged the necessity for 
attention being directed towards the stamping out of bovine 
tuberculosis. He considers that if measures were energetically 
carried through, the amount of surgical tuberculosis in children 
would rapidly diminish. He adds : ' I maintain, however, that 
until such legislation has been in force for some time it is the duty 
of the medical profession to insist on the boiling of all milk given 
to children. Professor von Pirquet, one of the greatest authorities 
on tuberculosis in Vienna, states that practically all the surgical 
tuberculosis which is met with in children in that city is due to 
the human bacillus. This statement would at first sight appear 
to throw doubt upon the reliability of the Edinburgh investigations, 
but when Professor von Pirquet assures us that the whole of the 
milk of Vienna is boiled we can quite understand why surgical 
tuberculosis in that city is never of bovine origin.'

The work above recorded affords indubitable evidence as to 
the infection of children by the bovine tubercle bacillus through 
the alimentary canal. 

C. On the Presence of Bacillus Abortus in Milk. A fair number 
of investigations have been carried out on the presence of Bacillus 
Abortus in the milk obtained from cows who had aborted in previous 
pregnancies. The disease is well known, and when it attacks a 
herd produces serious financial loss. 

It has been shown by numerous observers that the Bacillus 
abortus is present in the milk of cows both before they have shown 
any symptoms of abortion and also for a considerable period 
after the abortion has occurred. The disease, its prevalence, 
method of infection, etc., was investigated by a special committee 
appointed by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. In con- 
nection with this committee special investigations were carried 
out by MacFadyean and Stockman. 

Abortion is produced when the bacillus attacks the uterus, 
and the investigations were directed towards ascertaining how 
the disease reached this organ, and infection was found to take 
place readily by ingestion of the bacillus. In four experiments 
where the bacillus was given by the mouth three results were 
positive and one negative, and the committee states : ' With 
regard to infection by the mouth it is. a natural source of infection 
which until recently did not enter into anybody's calculations 
regarding the spread of abortion, and knowing, as we do, that the 
food including the bacillus, and even the feeding-trough, may more 
or less easily be contaminated on an infected establishment, it 
seems highly probable that infection by ingestion often takes place. 
In fact we are inclined to believe that the disease is more frequently 
contracted in this way than in any other. Presumably the bacilli 
are absorbed from the intestine and gain the blood stream whereby 
they reach the uterus. In the case of ewe 77 the microbe of cattle 
abortion was found in the cotyledons six days after infection by 
the mouth.' 

The committee further showed that a large number of animals 
are susceptible to the disease arising from the Bacillus Abortus, 
and they produced abortion experimentally in cows, ewes, goats, 
bitches, and guinea-pigs, and state that Bang also was successful 
in producing abortion in a mare. 

The committee say : ' Although it is hardly germane to the 
present enquiry we think it advisable to point out that since the 
bacillus of cattle abortion is pathogenic for so many species, the 
possibility of the human female being infected should not be lost 
sight of.' 

The prevalence of the disease in this country was also investigated 
by the committee, who found it impossible to ascertain the precise 
prevalence in the absence of any order requiring the disease to 
be reported. Information given voluntarily by stock-owners 



258 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

having infected herds showed that the disease was found in fifty- 
five farms which were situated in no less than thirty-six different 
counties. 

The presence of the bacillus in milk was investigated by Schroeder 
and Cotton. They found that the milk from apparently healthy 
cows which did not react to tuberculin, might contain Bacillus 
Abortus, and that these bacilli when injected into guinea-pigs 
produced lesions similar to, but not identical with, those produced 
by tubercle bacilli. They found that the abortus bacillus could 
be detected in the udder when no trace of disease could be found 
on examining the carcase. Further, they found that the excretion 
of this organism in the milk is extremely persistent, having been 
traced in one case for a period of eleven months after the abortion. 
They confirm the work of MacFadyean and Stockman in regard 
to the infection of other animals, and produced characteristic 
lesions by feeding, in cattle, sheep, goats, mares, guinea-pigs, 
rabbits. 

Schroeder and Cotton investigated the milk from cows on two 
farms and also from individual cows. On one farm there were 
140 cows tested with the tuberculin and found to be free from 
this disease ; nineteen cows, however, showed a positive reaction 
for the abortus bacillus. On the second farm of thirty-six cows, 
eleven gave positive reaction, and in the total number of cows 
investigated 14 per cent, were found to contain the Bacillus Abortus. 

Smith and Fabyan showed that the foetus obtained from a 
guinea-pig infected with Bacillus Abortus when injected into another 
guinea-pig gave rise to lesions simulating tubercle but in reality 
due to the Bacillus Abortus. These lesions could be reproduced 
at will in a series of animals. The authors believe that tuberculous 
lesions are sometimes stated to occur which are in reality due to 
the Bacillus Abortus. The organism was found to grow readily 
in milk. 

Zurick and Krage investigated the milk from three cows which 
had respectively aborted fourteen days, six months, and thirteen 
months previously. The abortus bacillus was found in all cases, 
but no pathological changes could be detected either in the udder 
or in the milk. They found that if the bacilli were injected into 
one side of the goat's udder they were excreted from the injected 
side four or five days after the injection but not from the other 
side. The blood of the goat showed agglutinating power for 
the Bacillus Abortus. In other experiments the bacilli were intro- 
duced intravenously or subcutaneously. Two of the animals 
injected showed Bacillus Abortus in the milk within twenty-four 
hours, a third in forty-eight hours, and the organism persisted 
in the milk for a period of about three weeks. 

Schroeder (i), in the course of work carried out upon the nutritive 
properties of boiled milk for guirtea-pigs, found lesions in some of 
the guinea-pigs examined, which caused him to investigate the 



THE PRESENCE IN MILK OF CERTAIN ORGANISMS 259 

milk which had been used. All the milk was obtained from tuber- 
culin-tested cows kept at the experiment station and was of super- 
lative quality. 

At the time of the experiment it was not known that one cow 
in the herd from which the milk was obtained was infected with the 
Bacillus Abortus, and it appears that there was at that time on 
evidence whatever of the cow being thus infected. Working in 
conjunction with Cotton, Schroeder had previously discovered 
that milk containing this bacillus, if injected into guinea-pigs, 
gave rise to this disease in guinea-pigs. 

In another paper Schroeder (2) showed that many if not most 
cows that become infected with the Bacillus Abortus remain chronic 
carriers for long periods of time, possibly permanent carriers, and 
that the bacillus is of common occurrence in the milk of cows that 
have ceased to abort and have produced several healthy calves in 
succession. Among aborting cows the bacillus appears in the 
milk before an abortion occurs, and in one instance was discovered 
in the milk of a cow that did not abort until 255 days later. These 
facts afford strong testimony to the impossibility of securing milk, 
from even the most carefully supervised cows, that can be guaranteed 
free from the germs of disease. 

Although somewhat beyond the immediate scope of this work, 
it may be mentioned that Teacher and Burton found that abortion 
in guinea pigs was apparently produced both by streptococci and 
by a diphtheroid bacillus. In two cases the changes in the placenta 
resembled the white infarctions found in human placentae : no 
bacteria could be found, but the authors believed that the lesion 
was probably of streptococcal origin. 

D. On Milk-borne Epidemics. It is not proposed to enter 
into any detail as to the epidemics which have been attributed to 
milk-borne organisms. For the most part these epidemics have 
been of the nature of sore throats varying greatly in intensity. Some 
diphtheria epidemics have also occurred. Three outbreaks, which 
will not be dealt with, are stated to have been of the nature of 
gastro-enteritis. In some cases the symptoms have been of an 
extremely severe type, and although the sore throat was the primary 
symptom, this has been succeeded by serious secondary troubles, 
leading in many cases to death. 

In 1912 Savage summarised the epidemics which have been 
regarded as being due to milk in this country. 

Out of nineteen epidemics investigated, the source of infection, 
although most certainly due to milk, could not be precisely traced, 
but the remainder of the epidemics were traceable in most cases 
quite definitely to a diseased cow. 

Of the last the following is a brief summary : 

Rugby 1880 Apparently due to a cow suffering from mastitis. 

Dover 1884 Believed to be due to cows among whom some had 

suffered from foot-and-mouth disease.

Streptococci found in the milk of a variety which 
was virulent to mice. It seemed doubtful 
whether the farmer or the cows on the farm had 
first shown symptoms of trouble, but the epide- 
mic appears to have been transmitted to the milk. 

Streptococcal outbreak attributed by Prof. Ken- 
wood to two cows in unsatisfactory condition of 
health. 

An epidemic of mild tonsillitis believed to be due 
to an eruption of the teat of a new cow introduced 
into the herd which had spread to other cows. 
The hands of four out of eight of the milkers 
became affected with similar eruptions. The 
epidemic stopped when the milk from this farm 
was sterilised before use. 

An epidemic of at least 600 cases. This epidemic 
was traced to infection from one cow which had 
mastitis. The milk from this cow, which was 
known to be sick, had been added to the common 
milk supply for some time. Cessation of the 
epidemic corresponded with the exclusion of the 
milk from this cow. 

Epidemic of diphtheria. Several cows were found 
with pustules which had practically dried upon 
the teats. The Klebs-Loeffler bacillus was not 
found in the pustules. It was suggested that 
the pustules had been cow-pox. | 

At least 504 cases of sore throat occurred. The 
cause was traced to a cow with a diseased udder 
giving milk containing streptococci which were 
pathogenic to mice. 

A similar survey of the epidemics in America has been prepared 
by Trask, and should be consulted for further information. 

Serious epidemics of sore throats due to streptococci in the 
milk occurred in America in the year 1911-12. 

Hamburger describes an epidemic in Baltimore. The milk 
concerned in the production of the epidemic all came from one 
dairy which collected milk from many farms. The milk had been 
pasteurised at the dairy by the flash method, i.e. just raised to 
160 F. Subsequently it was held at a temperature of 145 F. for 
from twenty minutes to half an hour. When the dairy raised the 
temperature of the pasteurisation and the customers were advised 
to boil the milk, the epidemic subsided, although a few stray cases 
occurred, apparently by infection from one person to another. 
Investigation showed thai in the few days preceding the outbreak 
of the epidemic pasteurisation had been omitted.

A very severe epidemic of streptococcal sore throats occurred 
in Cambridge, Mass., in the winter of 1911-12, and was dealt with 
by several authors (cp. Winslow and Darling). It was known that 
730 cases occurred, but the real number was probably considerably 
above this. Twenty-seven deaths occurred among the persons 
attacked, of whom the majority were over forty years of age. 
Children appeared to be comparatively immune. The bacterial 
content of the milk supplied from the dairy was fairly low, being 
approximately 300,000 per c.c. Two-thirds of the samples examined 
gave a count below 50,000 and half of the samples below 10,000. 

Capps and Miller investigated an outbreak of sore throats 
in Chicago due to streptococcal infection of the milk supply. The 
epidemic presented features of considerable interest and involved 
about 10,000 cases, which is considered to be a conservative esti- 
mate. A number of deaths occurred as a result of the infection. 
The outbreak was divided into two parts : the first occurred about 
September 2i,rising in intensity to the 25th,when it rapidly subsided. 
The second outbreak of cases, which was not so numerous, occurred 
on January i and 2, with a slight interruption from the loth to 
the iyth of this month. The epidemic was worse in some parts 
of the city than others, and was bad in the village of Batavia, 
which lies just outside Chicago. The source of infection was traced 
to a dairy whose pasteurising plant was in Batavia. It was found 
that a few days before each of the outbreaks there had been serious 
defects in the pasteurisation, which had been especially bad on 
December 17 and December 19. The milk appears to have been 
consumed two or three days after pasteurisation and the incubation 
period to have been about four days. An interesting point arises 
in the fact that at one children's hospital which was supplied 
with milk from this dairy the children did not suffer at all, although 
the nursing and medical staff suffered severely. Investigation 
showed that the milk supply for the children was delivered raw 
and pasteurised in the hospital before being given to the children, 
while the milk supplied for the staff was obtained direct from the 
dairy, where it was supposed to have been pasteurised and did 
not undergo any further heating. Investigation on the farms 
which supplied milk to the dairy showed that there had been 
an unusual number of cases both of mastitis in the cows and of 
sore throats in several of the persons on the farms supplying the 
milk to the dairy. Samples of milk supplied from the farms were 
found to contain pus and streptococci. 

Outbreaks due to milk infection were reported upon by Fletcher 
in Woodbridge in 1913-14, and by Macewen in South London. 
In the latter case the epidemic appears to have been due to infection 
from the teats of the cows, which was also found on the milkers' 
hands. At the time of the investigation the Klebs-Loeffler bacillus 
was isolated from the hands of two of the milkers; The pustules 
on the cows' teats had however become dry and the organisms 



262 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

were not obtained from them. The epidemic ceased when the 
milk from this cow was pasteurised. 

Epidemics of scarlet fever and typhoid fever have been traced 
to infection from the milk supply in a number of cases. Such 
infection usually occurs from the presence of the organisms in one 
of the milkers, or in one of the inhabitants at the farm. Cases 
are given both by Savage and Trask, and others have occurred 
in recent years. Thus Meader reports an outbreak of 139 cases of 
scarlet fever, and 282 cases of sore throat, which may have been 
a mild form of the disease. The source of infection was traced 
to one of the milkers, and the large number of cases arose from 
the fact that the contaminated milk was mixed with a large volume 
of other milk. 

These epidemics occur in spite of all observance of apparently 
adequate precautions. Pathogenic streptococci have been shown 
above to occur in ' certified ' milk. Winslow, in describing the 
severe epidemic of tonsillitis which occurred in Boston, Mass., in 
1911-12, says : ' I am at a loss to suggest any other precautions 
that could have been taken to guard against infection with human 
germs of disease that were not taken in this instance. Excellent 
regulations were drawn up for the exclusion of contagion, the 
milkers and the cattle carefully inspected, the dairy was admirably 
arranged, and the whole process controlled by laboratory examin- 
ations under the direction of bacteriologists and sanitarians of the 
highest standard. If in spite of such precautions the milk becomes 
infected, any raw milk supply may at any time become infected ; 
and this I believe to be the lesson not only of this outbreak, but 
of many that have preceded it in all parts of the world. It is 
practically impossible to exclude mild and unrecognised cases of 
disease of the process of milk production. The larger the supply 
the greater, of course, is the danger, but even a small supply must 
meet it at some time. Thus a cough over the pail, a finger inside 
the can as it is lifted, and the danger is imminent. There is in 
my judgment but one safeguard against such outbreaks proper 
pasteurisation.' 

There is little to add to this summary of the position : owing 
to the risks of subsequent contamination, however, pasteurisation 
is safest when carried out in the home.

CHAPTER XVI 

NOTES ON THE SOURCES OF THE CONTAMINATION OF MILK 

THE contamination of milk is brought about by the addition to 
it of bacteria, and is liable to occur at all stages of its production, 
and of its transit to the consumer. 

The class of bacteria will evidently differ very greatly, and 
will depend upon the source of the contamination. These following 
sources may be regarded as the more common : 

1. From the cow herself, either from the udder or from other 
parts of the animal. 

2. From the milker. 

3. From the cow-shed, either from the air, the walls, floor, 
bedding, or the food. 

4. From the milk-pails. 

5. In the process of filtering and cooling. 

6. From churns or bottles. 

7. In the process of transit from the farm to the dairy and from 
the dairy to the customer. 

8. In the course of manipulation at the dairy. 

9. In the home of the customer. 

These sources may now be considered individually : 

I. From the Cow herseli It seems hardly possible, even when 
full precautions are taken, to obtain milk by the ordinary process 
of milking which has a lower count than a few hundred bacteria 
per cubic centimetre. Seibold, using antiseptics for washing the 
teats, and after discarding a considerable amount of first milk, was 
able in a few instances to obtain sterile milk by milking directly 
into sterile tubes. Ordinarily, however, sterile milk can only be 
obtained by the use of a milking-tube passed up the teat into the 
space which occurs in the cow's udder between the gland tissue and 
the teat, and by collecting the milk thus obtained, all the apparatus 
used having been previously sterilised. The counts obtained by 
Seibold, and later by Rullmann, using all precautions, were found 
to vary from o to about 400 bacteria per c.c. 

In cases where there is disease of the udder the organisms pro- 

265 



266 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

ducing the disease will be passed out into the milk, which will be 
contaminated at its site of production. This subject has already 
been dealt with in Chap. XV. 

It has also been noted in Chap. VII that streptococci, and hence 
presumably other organisms, may gain entrance to the teats from 
the outside of the udder and teats. 

The first jets of milk which leave the udder on milking are 
known to contain a larger number of bacteria than the later portions, 
and it is usual in producing milk of a high quality to reject the 
first portion of milk. 

Further, the cows, unless cleaned, usually have their hind- 
quarters contaminated by faeces and urine. Pascal matter is replete 
with organisms, of which the most characteristic and the best known 
are those of the coli group. The presence of Bacillus coli is usually 
regarded as diagnostic of faecal contamination. When present in 
milk it is probable that its main source of origin is from the faeces 
of the cow. The faeces are allowed to dry on the hindquarters 
of the animal and tend in the process of friction of the milker 
against the cow to fall or be wafted by air currents into the milking 
pail. The greater part of the dirt, i.e. sediment, which is found in 
milk is well known to be mainly composed of faecal material. A 
small amount of such material in the milk provides a rich supply 
of coli organisms. 1 

It is not necessary to consider at length the literature upon this 
subject, but it may be mentioned in passing that Hewlett and 
Barton, examining milk as it came into London from a very large 
number of English counties, found that in 46 per cent, of the samples, 
Bacillus coli was present in I c.c. of milk. It is probable that 
had larger quantities of milk been taken, the percentage would have 
been still higher. 

Other organisms will be attached to the hair of the cow and, 
together with the hairs rubbed off in the process of milking, will 
fall into the milk. On farms where milk with a low bacterial count 
is produced, it is not unusual for the cows' udders to be clipped in 
order to remove the main growth of hair. Such clipping is probably 
especially valuable in certain cases where the hairs grow almost 
on to the teats and will be rubbed in the process of milking. Where 
the milker leans his head against the side of the cow, hair from the 
cow's flanks will also fall probably into the milk. 

2. From the Milker. The milker's hands are a potent source 
of origin for bacteria in milk. In the course of milking any dirt 
which is on the hands will gradually be rubbed off and find its 
way into the milk. A practice exists among dirty milkers of milking 
with their hands moistened by means of their own saliva. This 
revolting practice, which is known as ' wet ' milking, clearly adds 
to the bacterial contamination of the milk. In the first place 

1 The remarks of the Royal Commission on tuberculosis, quoted on p. 253, 
may also be referred to. 



NOTES ON THE SOURCES OF CONTAMINATION 267 

the organisms present in the milker's mouth or throat will be 
transferred to the milker's hands. In the process of milking 
there will be an accumulation of bacteria, epithelial de*bris and 
dirt, both from the hands of the milker and from the teats of 
the cow. A large proportion of this material will fall into the 
milk-pail. 

Some of the epidemics which have arisen as a result of con- 
taminated milk, have been traced directly to disease in the milkers. 
A milker with a sore throat will be liable to infect the milk with 
the organisms present in his throat. One suffering from pulmonary 
tubercle will transfer tubercle bacilli to the milk with the greatest 
ease, either by a cough or by the saliva if the hands are moistened 
with it. Epidemics of scarlet fever have been traced to infection 
from a member of the dairy staff through the milk. Further, 
epidemics of typhoid fever have been traced to the fact that one 
of the milkers was a carrier of these germs. 1 

3. From the Cow-shed. It is not necessary to dwell upon this 
subject, since the presence of large numbers of organisms in straw, 
etc., is a matter of universal knowledge. These organisms cannot 
fail to be present in the air of the cow-shed where bedding or fodder 
is present, and a certain number will inevitably find their way into 
the milk-pail. Where it is desired to obtain a milk of low bacterial 
content, it is usual either to milk the cows in a shed where no 
bedding is allowed, or to use sawdust for bedding instead of straw 
or similar substance. The bacteria which gain access from these 
sources are probably harmless. 

4. From the Milk-pails. A dirty milk-pail will contaminate 
the milk which is milked into it, and it is to be feared that there 
is frequently a lack of cleanliness, especially in the smaller farms, 
in regard to this matter. A good deal of the contamination referred 
to above could evidently be prevented if the contaminating matter 
were not allowed to fall into the pail. The reduction of the bacterial 
count by using (i) a properly shaped milk-can and (2) care in cleanli- 
ness of the milk-pails will be dealt with later. 

5. Conveyance from the Farm to the Customer. The sources of 
contamination under headings 5, 6, 7, and 8 (see above, p. 265) resolve 
themselves into a consideration of the conveyance of milk from 
the milking-shed to the customer, and will evidently depend upon 
the method of transit employed. So much has already been written, 
and so many investigations carried out, upon the various phases 
of contamination of the general milk supply in the course of its 
transit, that no further remarks will be made here. Those interested 
will find much information in the work of Houston and of Savage, 
and of the authors quoted by them. 

6. Contamination in the Home of the Customer. This source 
of contamination, which is outside the purview of investigations 

1 Cp. Chap. XV. 



268 MIL K AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

dealing with the general milk supply, is too frequently overlooked 
when the milk for infants is under consideration. A milk of the 
greatest purity introduced into a dirty home or placed in the hands 
of careless persons may become seriously contaminated before it 
reaches the child for whom it was intended. Perhaps one of the 
most serious difficulties encountered in the preservation of milk 
in the poorer class of homes arises from the absence of any satis- 
factory place for storage of milk. In this country there are no 
regulations requiring the delivery of milk at a low temperature, 
and it is probable that the bulk of the milk supplied by dairymen 
in this country is delivered at a temperature at which bacterial 
growth is proceeding with considerable rapidity. In many homes the 
only safe storage place is in a cupboard adjacent to the fire, separated 
only from the chimney by one layer of bricks. Here the milk, 
already warm, becomes still warmer, and the bacteria grow at an 
increasing rate of speed. A small degree of contamination in the 
original milk may therefore produce a highly contaminated milk 
before such milk is taken as food. Further, contamination may 
arise from the use of dirty vessels and from manipulation with 
dirty hands, or from leaving the milk uncovered and exposed to 
aerial contamination. It is hardly necessary to elaborate these 
sources of contamination any further, as everyone will be able to 
supply additional personal data. 

The bacterial content of raw milk, when it reaches the 
consumer in the course of the daily milk round, will usually have 
reached at least one million organisms per c.c. (a cubic centimetre 
is about eighteen minims), and will often be many times that figure. 
The high degree of bacterial contamination is not realised owing 
to the opacity of milk. 

Houston, summing up the results of his investigations upon 
bacterial examinations of milk, says : ' The whole history of milk 
from start to finish, from secretion by the cow to ingestion by the 
human being, is fraught with " potential " risk to the consumer. 
The influence of time and temperature on the microbial qualities 
of milk is most important. Milk is not generally consumed fresh, 
and commonly many hours elapse between the time of milking 
and the time when the milk reaches the consumer. During this 
period bacteria multiply in the milk at a rate which is governed 
chiefly by the temperature. It follows that a comparatively clean 
milk to start with, after a lapse of some time and under the influence 
of a high temperature, will yield worse results as judged by the 
ordinary bacteriological tests than a milk containing initially an 
excess of filth but which is maintained at a low temperature or 
which has been examined shortly after milking.'

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER XVII 

ON THE PRODUCTION OF MILK AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FREE FROM 
CONTAMINATION 

IT is difficult to summarise the very wide question of milk produc- 
tion, and it is hoped that any one interested may read the chapter 
dealing with this subject. 

It is clearly of the greatest importance that an adequate and 
satisfactory milk supply should be provided for infants and young 
children. While it seems hardly necessary that the standard of 
' certified ' milk should be reached, an improved standard on that 
at present prevailing is very necessary. 

It has been shown in the preceding chapters that milk which 
has been boiled may safely be used as a food for infants, and that 
no disadvantage over raw milk can be traced for this purpose. 
On the other hand, the heating of milk should not be regarded as 
a means for removing micro-organisms, which have collected in 
large numbers in the milk, as a result of entirely unnecessary 
carelessness at various stages of the milk production.

CHAPTER XVII 

ON THE PRODUCTION OF MILK AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FREE FROM 
CONTAMINATION 

DIFFERENT views are taken as to the desirability of using milk in 
the raw condition as a food for infants. Whatever view, however, 
be taken upon this subject there can be no difference of opinion 
as to the desirability of obtaining milk for infants in as pure a 
condition as is possible. 

Of recent years, investigations which have been carried out both 
by hygienists and by agriculturists have shown the methods which 
it is desirable to adopt in order to secure a good milk supply for 
infants. The way was largely shown by the American Medical 
Milk Commissions, which commenced their work some thirty 
years ago. It is not possible in this work to enter into a detailed 
account of the work of these commissions, but a few notes may be 
made. 

Primarily these commissions set out to provide milk known as 
' certified ' milk, that is, it was certified by the commission as being 
of a prescribed standard. Certain conditions were formulated by 
the commissions which had to be complied with by any farmer, 
who was desirous of putting on sale milk of a quality which could 
be certified. 

The main conditions required are comprised in a bacterial 
standard of not more than 10,000 per c.c. when delivered to the 
consumer, the milk to be obtained from tuberculin-tested cows, 
with due precautions in regard to the possible infection of the milk 
either by disease in the cows or in the employees on the farm. 
The premises were subjected to frequent inspection by officers 
employed by the commissions, and the milk was examined not less 
often than once a week for bacteria content and for chemical 
composition. 

The chemical standards which are required by the commissioners 
vary slightly in the different districts of the United States. The 
fat content required varies fom 3-5 to 4-5 per cent., the most usual 
figure for the non-fatty solids being 8-5 per cent. The production 
of a milk of the bacterial standard required in ' certified ' milk 

271 



272 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

carries with it the necessary attention to the condition of the cows, 
of the sheds, etc. ; also the need for great care and cleanliness both 
in the milkers and in the methods of milking. 

Numerous precautions must be adopted in order to obtain a 
milk having a bacterial content of not more than 10,000 per c.c. 
when delivered to the customer. This figure, although it appears 
to be so low as to be almost unattainable to the average farmer, 
has been exceeded for prolonged periods by a number of farms in 
the States. These farms have produced a milk, which, when tested 
under circumstances corresponding as closely as possible to those 
which would obtain at the time of the actual consumption of the 
milk, showed a bacterial count of 2000 per c.c. or even occasionally 
less. Only the main items requiring attention in order to produce 
milk of this quality will be dealt with. 

The Milking-shed. A separate shed should be employed for 
milking, or, if the cows are milked in the same shed as that in which 
they are kept during the rest of the day, the bedding must not be 
of straw or other dried herb : sawdust is preferable. Suitable 
sheds are required, great cleanliness is necessary, and the sheds 
should, as far as possible, be washed down a little while before 
milking. Various arrangements are in use in regard to the position 
occupied by the cows in the shed. It is perhaps more usual now- 
adays for the cows to be arranged in two rows with their heads 
facing one another, with space to admit of feeding between 
the two rows of cows, as shown in the accompanying plate. The 
floor slopes slightly both ways towards the trough, into which the 
dirty water, faeces, etc., fall or are swept and pass along it out of 
the shed. 

The cows themselves must be free from disease, and for this 
purpose should be tested every six months with tuberculin and 
should be subjected at frequent intervals to careful veterinary 
examination. The frequency of such examinations varies in 
practice from once a week to once a month. The presence of 
disease cannot however be absolutely excluded even under these 
conditions. A cow which is tested with tuberculin in January 
will not react to a fresh injection within the next six months, 
although there is no protection whatever against the contraction 
of tubercle within that period should the cow be in contact 
with any source of this disease. During the six months' interval 
she may for a long period easily excrete tubercle bacilli in the 
milk which will pass undetected and be capable of giving rise to 
tubercular disease. 1 

The cleanliness of the cows is also a most important point, and 
the cow's hindquarters and udder should be cleansed before each 
milking. There is some^divergence of practice in regard to the

details of the method pursued. In some farms warm water is 
used, in others cold water. It is usual, however, not to leave 
any part of the cow actually wet, more especially the udder. The 
hindquarters should be dried down with a cloth after washing, 
and it is a frequent practice only to rub the udder over with a 
damp cloth. 

The effect of the method of cleaning the udder upon the number 
of moulds and fungi alone was investigated by Leufven by the 
following means. He prepared sterile flasks, of which the bottom 
was covered with a medium suitable for the growth of bacteria. 
Three cows were used. The udder of cow No. I was washed 
before milking and was then dried ; the udder of cow No. 2 was 
rubbed over before milking with a dry cloth ; the udder of cow 
No. 3 was left untouched. The milking was then commenced, and 
the flasks were exposed for one second by removing the plug and 
holding the flasks just over the edge of the milking-bucket, both at 
the beginning and at the end of milking, separate flasks being used. 
Only the moulds and fungi which grew upon the media were counted, 
and the following figures were obtained from i square centimetre 
of the nutrient medium :

Evidently in the third case the number decreased at the end 
of milking owing to the major part of those present hav'ng 
already been passed out into the milk in the earlier phases of 
milking. 

The milkers must be themselves free from disease, and in order 
to secure this rendition they should be examined at relatively 
frequent intervals by a doctor. Any case of suspected illness 
in a milker should lead to his prompt exclusion from milking 
until either the disease is cured or the danger has been 
eliminated. Many epidemics which have been traced to the 
milk supply have been found to arise from the presence of the 
organisms of disease, in one of the milkers or of those handling 
the milk. 1 The milkers should wash their hands carefully, and 
the nails should be kept short and clean. They should wear white 
overalls and caps and should not be allowed to lean their heads 
against the side of the cow. Their hands should be dry when 
milking. They must not handle the milking-pail or o her 

Cp. Chap. XV. 



274 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

unsterilised article after having washed their hands prior to 
milking. The hands should be washed between the milking 
of each cow. On some farms the overalls and caps worn are 
sterilised in steam; in others they are merely kept clean by 
frequent washing. 

Milking machines have been invented with a view to the 
economy of labour and also from a desire to obviate some of the 
possible contamination of milk from an unclean or diseased 
milker. At first these milking machines were not found very 
satisfactory, because they did not milk the cow completely, 
but left behind much of the strappings, which have been shown 
on p. 22 to contain the highest fat content. As a result of this 
unsatisfactory emptying of the gland, the cows tended to go 'dry.' 
More recently, milking machines have been invented which are 
stated to milk the cows more completely, although it seems that 
certain cows can never be milked completely with the machine 
but must be stripped by hand afterwards. So long as stripping 
is accomplished the use of the milking machine does not appear 
to have any injurious effects upon the cows, nor to reduce the 
yield of milk.* 

The milking machines are said to economise labour, as several 
cows can be milked at the same time, but the discussions of dairymen 
reported from America hardly suggests complete uniformity of 
opinion. Regarded from the hygienic aspect in relation to the milk 
supply, it seems difficult to believe that the milking machine is not a 
step backwards. The rubber tubes are known to be very difficult to 
cleanse, and flexible tubes must be used in view of the probable 
movement of the cows. Unless these machines are used with a 
care and cleanliness which can hardly be expected of anyone with- 
out a bacteriological training, it is greatly to be feared that they 
will prove an insidious variety of the old long-tubed feeding-bottles, 
now justly condemned as a death-trap for infants. A milking 
machine is shown in the accompanying plate. The tubes are 
applied to the several teats, and a reduction of pressure in 
the can is produced. By this means the milk is sucked into 
the can. 

The pail used is a matter of very considerable importance. 
The old-fashioned open pail should not be used. A hooded pail, 
or one with a side aperture, gives greatly superior results, and the 
pail which has a side aperture only, is said to be superior to the 
hooded variety. These pails, which are shown in the figure, p. 275, 
prevent the contamination of the milk, by bacteria from the cow or 
from the air, which may, and usually do, fall into the milk-pail 
from above. 

The following figures, which were obtained as a result of bacterio- 
logical experiments recently made at Birmingham at four good

As each cow is finished milking, the milk should be removed 
at once to the dairy, and when it is required to maintain a low 
bacterial count, should be passed straight through the necessary 
manipulptions for bottling. 

The first ph"se in such minipul tions is u?u lly trrt of filtration, 
The value of this procedure appears, however, to have been con- 
siderably overrated. It is true that the gross particles of dirt

are kept back, but these gross particles should not be present. 
They are usually portions of dried faecal material which have become 
detached from the cow, and should be absent.

to the top part, and is filtered through a layer of woolly substance 
(4), which is held in position between wire-discs (3), and the 
piece (2), which is secured by a metal spring. 



Savage gives data upon the bacterial content of milk which 
had been filte ed and of similar samples which were not filtered. 
He quotes two sets of experiments, one set in which the Ulax 
filter was used (see figure), and another in which a different 
strainer was used. 

The milk is said to have been collected in the ordinary way

Commenting on the results, Savage says : ' . . . On the whole 
the experiments showed no bacterial advantage from filtration

of the milk, and this although one of the supposed best strainers 
was employed, the apparatus steamed before each experiment, 
and the wool used for the filtration of only half a gallon of milk.' 

In the case of the other filter, he says : ' The strainer in this 
experiment consisted of wire gauze and a layer of loose flannel- 
like material. It rapidly strained the milk. It was fixed in a 
shed near the cow-sheds, and the farmer had unbounded faith in 
its filtration properties, rather to the neglect of ordinary clean- 
liness in milking.' In these samples the number of bacteria in 
the unstrained sample was 5980 and in the strained sample 43,300. 
Savage says : ' In this experiment the straining added a large 
number of bacteria to the milk, no doubt partly from the strainer 
being dirty, causing a breaking down of the manure or other 
particles, and a better distribution of the bacteria.'

MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



After milking, the milk should be at once cooled. The most 
usual apparatus is shown in some detail in .the figure on p. 277, and 
on a smaller scale in plate facing p. 280. 

The milk is usually conducted straight from the filter to the 
trough on the top of the cooler. It then passes through the small 
holes on to the outer aspect of the cooler, passing down in a thin 
stream over the corrugated surface to the lower trough, whence it is

ments on p 279. The position of 
the four thermometers is seen in 
the diagram. 

conveyed to bottles, churns, or a pasteurising "plant, as desired. 
The corrugated surface is formed by the outside of pipes, which 
contain water, the entering and exit pipes for which are shown in 
the figure. Except in the summer-time it is usually sufficient to 
employ a full stream of ordinary water, but in hot weather artificial 
cooling of the water by ice or the use of carbon dioxide or ammonia 
may be necessary. 

In some dairies the cooler is covered during use so as to avoid 
aerial contamination during the process. When the cooling is 
carried out in a clean room it is probable that there is very little 
contamination from this source. When, however, such cooling is 



PROD UCTION OF MILK FREE FROM CONTA MINA TION 279 

carried out in the open, this danger cannot be neglected and greatly 
reduces the value of the cooling. Cleanliness of the cooler is of 
course essential. 

The object of cooling is to prevent the multiplication of bacteria, 
and, when properly carried out with carefully collected milk, is of 
great importance. The temperature of milk appears to alter slowly 
when in bulk, whether in the direction of a rise or fall in tempera- 
ture. An effectual preliminary cooling secures a low temperature for 
some time afterwards. This point is well shown by the experi- 
ments carried out by Savage. A large churn containing 17 gallons 
of milk was employed, and four thermometers were used, the 
bulbs being placed at different levels in the milk, as shown in the 
figure on p. 278. 

In one case the milk was cooled in a cool chamber to about 
4'0 C. It was then allowed to warm up gradually by being kept 
at room temperature. The resulting temperatures are shown below.

280 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

Savage gives some interesting experiments upon the tempera- 
ture of milk in churns on its way to the customer. These experi- 
ments demonstrate the importance of a thorough cooling on the farm 
in view more especially of the absence of cooling facilities later on. 

In the first experiment the milk in the chum was warmed until 
the temperature after stirring reached 37'6 C. The milk was then 
sent out in the milk cart, covered with an ordinary canvas churn 
cover to protect it from the direct rays of the sun, and was driven 
all over London. It Itft the dairy at 11.30 A.M., the temperature 
of the air being 19 C. It returned to the dairy at 4 P.M., the air 
temperatu e being then 21 C. The temperature of the milk, how- 
ever, had only fallen to 30-8 C. 

In the next experiment the initial average temperature of the 
milk was reduced to 6-4 C. It left the dairy at 11.40 A.M. under 
similar conditions to the above. Th; initial air temperature was 
then i8'6 C. The milk was brought back to the dai.y at 4 P.M., 
the air temperature being then 21 '6 C. The tempera ure of the 
milk, however, was only 10*8 C., that is to say, in four and a half 
hours the temperature of the milk had only been increased by 
4.4 C, although the air temperature throughout was much higher. 

Evidently the alterations in the temperature of milk take place 
very slowly, owing no doubt to slowness of convection. 

The milk, after cooling, should be at once run into sterile 
receptacles. If into bottles, these should have been washed in 
hot water and soda, and after satisfactory rinsing should be 
exposed to the action of steam, and be kept mouth downwards 
until required for the next service. These bottles should be sealed 
on the farm at once, after filling, by means of a cap, and if considered 
desirable by means of some apparatus which will show whether the 
bottle has been kept intact or whether it has been opened after filling. 
This last is insisted on by the American Medical Milk Commissions. 

After the milk has been bottled it should be transported cool 
to the dairyman and delivered cool to the customer. 

The appara.us used ior bottling is shown in Plate V. The 
milk passes straight from the cooler to a tank, wiih numerous 
small pipes leading to bottles which are placed one below each 
pipe. An arrangement exists which allows a definite quant ty 
of milk to pass into the bottles, acco ding to the capacity of the 
bottles. As soon as the e are fiTed the milk flow stops and the 
whole tray with the bottles can be pulled to an adjacent platform, 
where they are at once covered. 

Milk sent in churns from the farm must be subsequently bottled 
by the dairyman, or be taken round in the churn and delivered in 
small quantitie , to the customers. 1 At every stage of its manipula- 

1 The contamination arising from the entry of dust through the so-called 
ventilation holes in the lids of churns, and the risk of contamination from 
manipulation on the journey or at the dairy are too well known to require 
further mention here.

PROD UCTION OF MILK FREE FROM CONTAMINA TION 281 

tion it will receive a fresh supply of micro-organisms, many of them 
doubtless from the air, and a certain number will be added owing 
to the difficulty of using strict cleanliness in every detail when 
so many processes are involved. Moreover, it is almost impossible 
for the temperature to be kept low throughout. 

In this country the transit of milk by bottles is extremely 
expensive, and is in fact prohibitive for the general milk supply 
at the present time. There are no means for keeping milk (sent 
on a large scale) cool during transit, and there can be no doubt 
that the temperature is often fairly high for a considerable period 
before the milk reaches the dairy, especially when delivered to 
iarge towns. 

Although it is not possible for all the precautions enumerated 
above to be adopted for the general milk supply without raising 
the cost of production to so high a figure as to be prohibitive for 
the general population, much improvement in the bacterial content 
of the general milk supply could be effected without any appreciable 
increase in cost. For instance, the cleanliness of the milkers, and 
in many respects of the cows and of the sheds in which the cows 
are kept, would not entail any appreciable additional labour when 
once the practice was started. The provision of satisfactory pails, 
which have been shown to exercise a great effect upon the bacterial 
content of the milk, is a very small item in the total cost of milk 
production. Churns have been manufactured having an air 
chamber round the milk, which aids very greatly in keeping the 
milk at a low tcmperatu-e during transit, if the milk has been 
properly cooled before being put on the rail. These are perhaps 
a somewhat expensive item, but doubtless could be supplied for 
at least a part of the milk supplied by a number o" farms even 
where the total cost of production cannot be raised, and yet allow 
a sufficient margin of profit to the farmer. 

A bacterial standard of 10,000 per c.c. is impracticable for the 
general milk supply, but there is no doubt that a standard of some 
tens of thousands only per c.c. could easily be attained if reasonable 
precautions were taken. It is of course possible to kill the bacteria 
by various methods, and it is advisable that all milk used should be 
heated before use, but this in no way alters the need for obtaining a 
reasonably low initial bacterial standard. So long, however, as the 
public continues to be satisfied with a milk containing an immense 
number of micro-organisms, so long, presumably, will the dairy 
farmer continue his out-of-date and dirty methods. If the public 
realised that the number of bacteria present in the average sample of 
market milk is so great that, were the milk transparent, it would be 
cloudy as the result of the presence of these organisms, more efforts 
might be directed towards the production of a milk having a low 
bacterial standard. The heating of milk, which kills this vast number 
of organisms, does not remove the dead bodies of the bacteria which 
have been present, nor does it destroy any harmful chemical sub- 



282 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

stances which may have been formed by them. Any actual 
decomposition of the constituents of the milk which may occur 
as the result of bacterial action is probably negligible and need 
not be seriously considered.

CHAPTER XVIII 

ON THE TYPES OF BACTERIA COMMONLY FOUND IN MILK AND 
THEIR THERMAL DEATH-POINTS 

THE varieties of bacteria present in milk will occur in innumer- 
able combinations, which will evidently depend upon the source 
from which they are derived, i.e. air, cow, milker, vessels, etc. 
Roughly, however, they can be classified into several main groupirgs 
according to the action they display upon certain substances. 
The most usual groupings are as follows : (i) Acid-forming bacteria, 

(2) those forming acid and gas with coagulation of milk protein, 

(3) peptonising bacteria, and (4) inert bacteria. 

Milk is a good medium for the growth of the majority of bacteria 
except where the growth of one organism is antagonised by that 
of another variety. 

In the early hours after milk has been collected there is an 
apparent decrease in the total number of organisms found. This 
has already been referred to on pp. 114-20 in connection with the 
alleged bactericidal properties of milk. It was there shown that 
this decrease is probably apparent rather than real, and due to 
the agglutination of the bacteria by the action of the agglutinins, 
which are found in milk. When milk, examined in the early hours 
after milking, is violently shaken so as to break up the clumps of 
bacteria, the number of colonies found on plating out samples of 
the milk does not suggest that there has been any actual decrease 
in the number of bacteria present. Some six hours after milking 
an increase in the bacterial content commences. The pre- 
dominating growth appears usually, if not always, in the acid- 
forming organisms. The acid thus produced renders the medium 
an unsuitable one for the growth of certain other organisms, which 
become gradually reduced in numbers. The rate of this reduction 
will depend upon the relative proportion of the bacteria present 
and the temperature at which the milk is kept. 

The increase in the number of acid-forming bacteria has been 
investigated by a number of workers, but is well shown in the 
following table, taken from the work of Conn and Stocking. Similar 
results were obtained by Conn and Esteiu

It is so well known that bacteria multiply more readily in a 
warm atmosphere than in a cold as to render it unnecessary to 
lay stress upon this point. A certain amount of work has been 
carried out in regard to the optimum temperature of the multipli- 
cation of different strains of bacteria, and there is some reason to 
believe that this temperature varies slightly for different organisms. 
There is no doubt that until the optimum temperature is reached 
the rate of growth becomes increasingly rapid. Some figures 
prepared by myself in relation to the growth of B. coli at different 
temperatures are illustrative of this fact and are given below : *

TYPES OF BACTERIA COMMONLY FOUND IN MILK 285 

Bacterial growth does not, however, entirely cease even at a 
temperature of o C, as has been shown by the work of Pennington 
and others. 

The work of St. John and Pennington shows also that 
bacteria multiply more readily in milk after it has been heated 
than before. This fact has been shown by a number of authors, 
reference to which will be found in the paper mentioned. 

The rate of development of bacteria in milk will depend upon 
the temperature at which the milk is kept on its transit from 
the farm to the consumer. Moreover, where milk is pasteurised 
on a large scale, any subsequent contamination will tend to pro- 
duce a rapid rise in the bacterial content of the milk which has 
been thus treated. 

There is no direct evidence as to the effect upon infants of 
feeding them with milk containing a high bacterial content, 
but the risk of pathogenic organisms is clearly increased when 
the total number is great. Moreover, it is well known that 
deleterious results 'are produced by feeding animals on large numbers 
of organisms even though these are of harmless types. Milk 
having a high bacterial content must be regarded as contaminated 
food, and general experience shows the risk of using such material. 

The investigations published by Park and Holt, and referred 
to in detail on pp. 192-3, illustrate this point. 

The remedy for existing contamination in a food material, lies in 
heating it before it becomes harmful, and this is the usual method em- 
ployed with milk. The possibility of the presence of toxic substances 
formed by the bacteria must be considered, but there is comparatively 
little evidence available on this subject. The only work in regard 
to the progress of children in relation to the bacterial content of 
milk appears to be another section of the work of Park and Holt. 
The work formed a part of the comprehensive investigation under- 
taken in New York City in the summers of 1901 and 1902. The 
children were visited in their homes by physicians appointed for 
the purpose, the method of feeding being noted, together with 
the progress of the children and the general home conditions. 
In cases where it was desired to study the effect of certain forms 
of milk, as in the work about to be described, arrangements were 
made for the supply of that milk to the people. The experiments 
are of sufficient interest to quote them somewhat freely. 

Efforts were made to secure comparable conditions in the 
various groups of children, but the difficulties connected with 
delivery of milk, etc., rendered it necessary to keep the groupings 
in different parts of the city. It happened that the children fed 
on the cheap store milk lived under worse home conditions than 
those fed on pure bottled milk. The table on the next page shows 
the figures obtained. 

The authors summarise the results as follows : ' There is nothing 
in the observations to show that fairly fresh milk from healthy

TYPES OF BACTERIA COMMONLY FOUND IN MILK 287 

' On the other hand, it is possible that certain varieties of bacteria 
may, under conditions that are unsanitary, find entrance to milk 
and survive moderate heat or may develop poisonous products 
resistant to heat in sufficient amount to be harmful, even when 
they have accumulated to less than 200,000 per c.c. 

'Turning now to the results of feeding with milk which has 
been heated and which before sterilisation contained from 1,000,000 
to 25,000,000 bacteria per c.c., averaging about 15,000,000, though 
obtained from healthy cows living under fairly decent conditions 
and kept moderately cool in transit, we find a distinct increase 
in the amount of diarrheal diseases. Though it is probable that 
the excessive amount of diarrhoea in this group of children was due 
to bacterial changes which were not neutralised by heat or to living 
bacteria which were not killed, yet it is only fair to consider that 
the difference was not very great, and that the infants of this group 
were under surroundings not quite as good as those on the purer 
milk. 

' Finally, we come in this comparison to the infants who received 
the cheap store milk pasteurised. This milk had frequently to be 
returned because it curdled when boiled, and contained, according 
to the weather, from 4,000,000 to 200,000,000 bacteria per c.c. 
In these infants the worst results were seen. This is shown not 
only by the death-rate, but by the amount and the severity of the 
diarrheal diseases, and the general appearance of the children as 
noted by the physicians. Although the average number of bacteria 
in the milk received by this group is higher than that received by 
the previous group, the difference in results between this group 
and the previous one can hardly be explained by the difference in 
the number of bacteria. The varieties of bacteria met with in 
this milk were more numerous than in the better milk, but we 
were unable to prove that they were more dangerous. Probably 
the higher temperature at which the milk was kept in transit and 
the longer interval between milking and its use allowed more toxic 
bacterial products to accumulate.' 

It has been shown in preceding chapters that it is practically im- 
possible to obtain milk which can be guaranteed free from germs of 
disease. The conditions under which 'certified' milk is produced 
could hardly be made stricter, and yet virulent streptococci and 
tubercle bacilli have been found in this milk. 1 The remedy can only 
be found in heating milk before use, and it becomes important to 
consider the temperature at which the more important organisms 
liable to be present in milk are destroyed. 

On the Thermal Death-points of Micro-organisms in Milk. 
Under this heading it will be necessary to consider the temperature 
at which special organisms of pathogenic type are destroyed, and also 
the general effect of different temperatures upon the large bacteria]

flora of comparatively harmless organisms, which have gained access 
to the milk in the process of its manipulation. 

The Thermal Death-point of Tubercle Bacilli. Much work has been 
done upon the temperature to which milk must be raised in order 
to destroy tubercle bacilli when they are present, and considerable 
diversity of results has been obtained. 

Rosenau has summarised the results of investigations of 
numerous observers, and the table on p. 289 is taken from his work. 1 

It seems hardly possible, from a consideration of the results 
shown in that table, to arrve at a definite temperature at which 
tubercle bacilli are killed, but it appears reasonable to suppose that 
a temperature of 60 C. for twenty minutes may be sufficient, or a 
short period at 95-100 C. 

De'le'pine in the course of his investigations found that tubercle 
bacilli were still living in milk which had been dried by passing 
over cylinders heated to 138-140 C. He points out, however, 
that this temperature is not reached by the milk as it passes between 
the rollers, and he ascertained by experiment, that the greater 
part of the milk must have remained at a temperature below 100 C., 
and he says that in all probability the maximum temperature reached 
by every part of the milk did not exceed 96 C., and that the dura- 
tion of the exposure to that temperature probably never exceeded 
3-3 seconds. 

The Thermal Death-point of Streptococci and other Organisms. 
Ayers and Johnson (i) investigated the temperature necessary to 
kill various strains of streptococci. They found that the strepto- 
cocci normally occurring in milk showed a greater resistance to 
temperature than those obtained from the udder or from the mouth 
or faeces of the cow. After examining the death-point of 139 strains 
they found that 

89 or 64-03 per cent, survived 30 minutes heating at 140 F., 

46 or 33-07 145 F., 

2-58 i6oF., 

while all were killed at a temperature of 165 F. for the same period. 

Rosenow found that the virulent streptococci obtained from 
an epidemic of sore throats were killed by a temperature of 45 C. 
or approximately 113 F. The non-virulent ones, however, survived 
a temperature of 60 C. or 140 F. His experiments were carried 
out in milk. 

The thermal death-points of numerous other pathogenic 
organisms, e.g. B. typhosus, B. diphtherae, B. cholorae, B. dysen- 
terae, and Micrococcus melitensis, were investigated by Rosenau 
with a view to determining the temperature to which milk must 
be raised in order to render it safe. The general conclusion reached 
by him was that ' milk heated to 60 C. and maintained at that

temperature for twenty minutes may be considered safe so far 
as conveying infection from the micro-organisms tested is con- 
cerned.' The micro-organisms included the Bacillus Tuberculosis. 

For the most part the investigations which have been carried 
out on the thermal death-point of bacteria in milk have been 
conducted entirely with a view to determining the lowest tempera- 
ture to which it was necessary to heat milk in order to render it safe. 

The investigations, which have been described in detail in 
Chap. XI, show that milk used for the feeding of infants may 
be raised without disadvantage for a short, or even a prolonged 
period, to a temperature which is approximately 100 C., or 212 F. 
It is shown on p. 296 that this temperature is not reached when 
milk is heated surrounded by a water-jacket. 

The conclusion which may be fairly made, is that milk when 
used as a food in the home may be heated to 100 C. approximately 
without any detrimental effect. Such heating, moreover, acts as 
an efficient safeguard against the causation of disease by harmful 
organisms accidentally present in the milk. 

The destruction of bacteria in the general milk supply assumes 
a slightly different character from that in the home. 

In the former case economy of fuel, appearance of the cream- 
line, etc., all tend to keep the temperature employed, as low as 
may be consistent with a destruction of the main mass of bacteria. 

The bacteria which survive pasteurisation have been studied 
in great detail by Ayers and Johnson (2) for the United States De- 
partment of Agriculture. These authors show that the majority of 
organisms are killed within the first half-hour of heating. Reduction 
does continue when the milk is heated for longer periods, but this 
reduction is proportionately small compared with that which 
occurs in the earlier period. The greater number of bacteria are 
destroyed in the first half-hour even at comparatively low tem- 
peratures. This is shown both in the figure on the next page 
and also in the tables appertaining to it, which are given below. 

The figures for the number of bacteria are given below, and 
show the efficacy of the comparatively small difference of tem- 
perature existing between 57-2 and 60 C.

Ayers and Johnson also studied the rate of destruction of different 
groups of organisms acid-forming, peptonising, inert, and alkali- 
forming and showed that the effect produced upon these by heat 
differs very considerably. 

The nature of the organisms surviving pasteurisation is shown 
in Plate V, the total numbers of bacteria at different times in the

The figure shows that the acid-forming organisms survive in 
greater number than any of the other types. The same result 
was obtained in a large number of experiments to which it is 
impossible to refer here. 

The authors remark that the change in the group percentages 
which is shown between three and a half and four hours is un- 
doubtedly due to experimental error.

CHAPTER XIX 

ON THE METHODS COMMONLY USED IN THE HEATING OF MILK 

THE use of cows' milk as a food for children has involved much 
discussion as to the best method of heating the milk. Different 
methods have been used in several countries, and there has been 
not only considerable difference of opinion as to the best method 
to employ, but also some confusion has arisen from the casual 
use of the same term to denote different methods of dealing with 
the food. It would not seem to be of any particular interest to 
endeavour to trace the origin of the divergence either in the practice 
or the use of terms, and it will be simpler here to explain briefly the 
present position and the practices which are very generally employed. 

It will be possible to consider the main forms of heated milk 
which are used under the terms, pasteurised, boiled, sterilised, and 
dried milk. 

Milk is heated for two purposes : (a) In order to destroy harmful 
bacteria, and (b) in order to preserve the milk for a longer period 
than would be the case if heat were not employed. In both cases 
the use of heat is connected with the presence of bacteria, since in 
the second case the milk is in danger of going sour owing to the 
presence of these organisms. 

PASTEURISED MILK 

Pasteurisation of milk appears to have been introduced by 
Soxhlet. The original term was used to denote a milk which 
had been heated to a temperature below that of boiling-point and 
which had been subsequently rapidly cooled. This general meaning 
is for the most part still preserved. Great differences, however, 
exist in regard to the method of carrying out the pasteurisation. 
Some pasteurisation is carried out at a temperature of only 60 C. 
(140 F.), and, on the other hand, it is not uncommon for the process 
to be designated as pasteurisation when the milk is in effect raised 
to a temperature approximately equal to the boiling-point of water 
100 C. (212 F.). Moreover, the length of time which is occupied 

294 



METHODS COMMONLY USED IN HEATING MILK 295 

both in attaining the maximum temperature and the period over 
which the milk is maintained at this temperature vary within 
wide limits. But the term ' pasteurisation ' appears to be applied 
very generally to them all, and at the present day appears merely 
to imply that the milk has been heated to a temperature which 
probably has not reached that of the boiling-point of water and 
that it has been subsequently rapidly cooled. 

The use of the lower temperatures (140-170 F.) is mainly 
commercial and hardly employed in the preparation of infants' food 
in the home. 




Apparatus for home pasteurisation. The carrier with 
bottles, when in position, rests with the upper disc 
of the carrier on the supports C in the vessel. 



The term is, however, frequently applied to the domestic pre- 
paration of food for infants. 

Where pasteurisation is concerned two points should be men- 
tioned : (a) The maximum temperature to which the milk is 
raised, and (b) the length of time the maximum temperature is 
maintained. It is rare, however, except in the literature dealing 
with the commercial pasteurisation of milk, to find any mention 
of these items, although the maximum temperature reached is 
sometimes given. 

Home Pasteurisation. It is usual in home pasteurisation to 
employ some form of apparatus of the type shown in the figure above 
Modifications will evidently be found in the number of bottles and 
in the shape of the bottle, the form of the carrier holding the bottles, 



296 



MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



etc. They all, however, agree in the main principles. These 
consist of a vessel which contains water and is of a sufficient depth 
for the bottles to be immersed in the water up to the neck. After 
heating to the required temperature, the bottles can be removed 
together in the carrier, and plunged into cold water. 

Some form of stopper or cap for the bottles is usually provided. 
In some cases the teat is put on the bottle before the heating is 
commenced, but it is not unusual for a plug of cotton wool to be 
placed in the neck of the bottle, this plug being subsequently 
removed and the teat placed on the bottle at the time of feeding. 
Where the milk has to be diluted or modified in any way, this 
modification is carried out before the heating is commenced. In 
practice it is not easy to ensure that the milk shall be heated only 
up to a definite temperature. A rise of temperature in the water 
does not show the precise temperature of the milk. Further, it 
would be necessary to watch the apparatus the whole time, 
otherwise it is likely that the temperature would frequently be 
exceeded. 

The figures obtained by Freudenreich and by Rosenau show 
that in practice it would be impossible to determine the precise 
temperature for the milk in the bottles. There is considerable 
difference in temperature between the water and the milk in the 
bottles, and further between the temperature of the milk in different 
parts of the bottles. Hence it is usual in practice to allow the 
water in the vessel to boil, and in some cases the water is allowed 
to boil for a few minutes. The figures given by Rosenau show 
that the temperature of the milk is much below that of the water, 
even when the water has been allowed to boil for over three minutes. 

Freudenreich's figures are as follows :

Commercial Pasteurisation. A. The Pasteurisation of Milk 
for Infants on a Large Scale. The pasteurisation of milk for 
infants is carried out by a considerable number of dairies and 
also in connection with the milk depots, which are described 
in detail in Appendix E. In general principles it resembles 
the methods above described for home pasteurisation. In this 
case, however, the bottles are not removed from the pasteuriser, 
but cold water is passed in at once as soon as the temperature 
has reached the required figure, and the milk cooled as rapidly 
as possible by this means. In some cases the milk may be of 
high quality, as is the case in certain of the continental dairies 
and in a few of the dairies in this country. Milk for infants 
which has been pasteurised is ready for consumption, and should 
not be again heated to a higher temperature than that of the body 
before being given to the infant. In order to avoid contamination 
it is usually prepared in the required modification and the required 
quantity for each feed. It may happen, however, that the whole 
milk is pasteurised and bottled without modification. In this 
case there is some danger from contamination in the home, as 
the milk is there subjected to further manipulation. 

The employment of pasteurisation for milk of good quality, 
which is used for infant feeding, has for its object the destruc- 
tion of any germs of disease which may have gained entrance 
from the cow, or from other sources in the course of milking and 
transit. The object is not to lengthen the period over which the 
milk will keep, but to ensure that disease is not contracted by the 
infant through its food. 

B. Commercial Pasteurisation of Milk in Bulk. Many persons 



298 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

who possess a wide knowledge of the conditions of the general 
milk supply, consider that all milk should be pasteurised before 
being placed on sale, with the possible exception of milk of a high 
quality which may be specially produced for infants or invalids. 
Others, again, consider that it is more advisable for the general milk 
supply to be sold without being heated, unless a statement is made 
to the effect that heat has been applied to the milk before sale. 
More discussion appears to have arisen in connection with the 
pasteurisation of the general milk supply in America, than in any 
other country. The advances which have been made in the United 
States in the production of ' certified ' milk have led to a close 
investigation of the general milk supply. 1 Where the general 
milk supply is under consideration it is contemplated that pasteur- 
isation shall take place as soon as possible after milking. The ob- 
ject of pasteurisation is, first, to remove any possible pathogenic 
bacteria which may be present, and, secondly, to preserve the milk 
for a longer period than would be the case if it were not heated. 
The preservation of the milk is perhaps more necessary in America 
than in this country. The milk has frequently to travel very long 
distances before it reaches the city in which it will be distributed. 
In the summer-time the heat is greater than in this country, although 
this adverse condition for the preservation of milk is to some extent, 
if not entirely, modified by the use of refrigerating wagons by the 
railway companies. Hence the milk, if it is placed on the train 
cool, does not become heated on the journey. The approximate 
duration of time which must elapse between milking and the dis- 
tribution of the milk is known to be considerable, and the milk is 
pasteurised in order to preserve it for this period. 

In many districts in America large pasteurising plants have 
been established, and the milk is brought to the pasteurising station 
from a number of farms in the surrounding district. The milk 
is then subjected to pasteurisation on a vast scale, being subse- 
quently despatched from the centre to the train, and to the town 
for which it is destined. Milk which has been pasteurised under 
this system must be sold as pasteurised milk, and may be further 
sold in grades of milk. 1 In America the lower grades of milk 
are not usually regarded as being suitable for infants' food, but 
for ordinary household or cooking purposes only. 

In this country pasteurisation, when used by dairymen, appears 
for the most part to be carried out on a relatively small scale by 
the individual dairyman, and to be used for the purpose of preserving 
milk which has not been sold on one day until the next day. That 
is to say, the milk is already somewhat stale and is heated in order 
to prevent it going sour before it can be sold. 

Two main processes are employed for the pasteurisation of 
milk and are known respectively as the ' holder process ' and the 

1 Notes upon the standards set by New York City will be found in 
Appendix G. * Cp. Appendix G. 



PLATE VII.

METHODS COMMONLY USED IN HEATING MILK 299 

'flash process.' Both systems are used in the United States, but 
in this country the ' flash ' process appears to be more generally 
used. 

1. The 'Holder Process.' In this process the milk is gradually 
brought up to the temperature which is intended to be the maximum 
temperature to which it shall be exposed, and is held at that tempera- 
ture for a given time. There is no definite temperature to which 
the milk is raised in this process, different dairies employing various 
temperatures. 

Ayers and Johnson, in their investigations carried out for 
the Department of Agriculture in Washington, made enquiries 
of the pasteurising firms in nearly all the American cities having 
populations of over 25,000. The replies showed that the average 
temperature with this process was 62-8 C. (145 F.). The actual 
temperatures used, however, varied very considerably. Out of 
219 plants, 75 used the holder process, and 62 of these employed 
a temperature of from 6o-65'5 C. (i40-i5o F.). One used a 
temperature somewhat below this, and 12 employed tempera- 
tures ranging from 66-j-76-j C. (i52-i7o F.). 

2. The 'Flash Process.' This process consists in heating the 
milk up to a particular temperature for one minute and then rapidly 
cooling it. Out of the 219 milk plants concerning which information 
was obtained, 144 used the flash process, the average temperature 
being 71-1 C., or 160 F. Of the 144 plants, 61 used the average 
temperature, 61 used temperatures below the average (being in 
some cases as low as 140 F.), and 22 used temperatures above the 
average, in some cases as high as 82-2 C., or 180 F. No reasons 
appear to be given for these great divergences in practice. It is 
probable that the lower temperatures are in some of the cases 
too low to be of any appreciable value, since they hardly touch 
the thermal death-point of a considerable number of organisms. 

The cream-line is said to be affected when the temperature is 
raised above 150 F. Hence the object of many of the pasteurising 
firms is to keep the temperature about this point. 

The cost of pasteurising must be borne in mind, and the holder 
process will involve a longer heating and hence be more expensive 
than the flash process. 

Some authorities consider that the holder process is a safer 
method than the flash process, but this probably depends very 
largely upon care exercised by the individual dairyman. 

A pasteurising apparatus is of necessity a somewhat compli- 
cated one, and the problem of keeping it clean cannot be regarded 
as a simple matter. Plate VII shows the exterior of a pasteurising 
plant. The milk after heating is conducted to the cooler, over 
which it passes on its way to the tank, and thence to the bottles 
The figures which have been already given show the differences 
of temperature which obtain in different parts of even a small 
amount of milk when it is being heated. In order to ensure that 



300 



MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 



milk in bulk shall reach the average temperature aimed at,' some 

form of .stirring must be resorted to in order to keep the milk heated 

evenly as it passes up to the required temperature. It will of 

necessity have to pass through various pieces of apparatus, and a 

number of forms of such apparatus involve a coil of somewhat 

narrow dimensions through which the milk is made to circulate. 

The purpose of this coil is to cool the milk either by means of cold 

or iced water, or sometimes by running the milk which is to be 

pasteurised, and is cool, through the coil, thus saving some heat. 

If the object of pasteurisation is to be attained, absolute cleanliness, 

and if possible sterility, must be secured in the apparatus used, 

otherwise there is a danger that the milk may acquire as many 

bacteria from the pasteurising plant as it loses in the process of 

heating. The net result, therefore, is that little or no advantage 

has been gained by the pasteurisation. 

The figures of Pennington and McClintock (given below) are of 
considerable interest in this connection, and show the recontamina- 
tion of milk as a result of an unclean pasteurising plant.

These figures afford excellent examples of contamination by 
dirty machinery. 

Another example of contamination in the process of condensa- 
tion is given by Detepine in the course of his investigations upon 



METHODS COMMONLY USED IN HEATING MILK 301 

the fate of bacteria added to a sample of milk which was to 
be condensed. He shows that a considerable increase in the number 
of bacteria the increase being chiefly due to moulds occurred 
in the course of the process, and he states that this may be attributed 
to the presence of some bacteria and moulds in the delivery pipe 
used to empty the vacuum pan. The conditions under which the 
milk was manipulated were stated to have been excellent. 

The temperatures to which milk should be heated in order to 
destroy certain forms of bacteria, both pathogenic and otherwise, 
are considered in Chap. XVIII. But it may be stated that the 
dangers of dirty apparatus or of ineffectual pasteurisation should 
not be minimised. They have been shown to be real. In this 
connection Chap. XV, section D, dealing with milk epidemics, may 
be compared. 

These difficulties, and the dangers connected with commercial 
pasteurisation, are dwelt upon by many authors who have written 
upon the subject. Thus Savage points out that one of the 
objections arises from the sale of milk which, owing to pasteurisa- 
tion, is prevented from souring, and ' in practice probably often is 
kept over a number of days. Old, stale milk may be sold as fresh 
owing to the removal of most of the lactic acid bacilli. Such milk 
will appear normal to sight and taste, but may be bacterially 
highly dangerous. If used without statutory control, there can 
be little doubt that the extensive use of pasteurisation would lead 
to neglect of general sanitary conditions even more than is the 
case to-day, under the belief that the pasteurisation would be an 
efficient substitute for cleanliness. ... It is probable that much 
commercial pasteurisation is inefficiently done. It is a procedure 
involving an accurate adjustment of time and temperature, and 
frequently being left to be performed by careless and unskilled 
persons (the so-called " practical man " ), it is very unequally and 
inefficiently done. If pasteurisation is to be allowed at all, it 
should be controlled both as regards methods and apparatus. In 
the writer's opinion, summing up the matter, pasteurisation is an 
efficient and useful procedure which may be very valuable pending 
satisfactory and radical improvement in the milk business as a 
whole, but it is likely to be more harmful than beneficial unless the 
practice is rigidly supervised, and the conditions under which 
it may be employed regulated.' Rosenau, in his work upon 
pasteurisation undertaken for the Hygienic Laboratory in Washing- 
ton, says : ' One of the chief objections to pasteurisation is that 
it promotes carelessness and discourages the efforts to produce 
clean milk. It is believed that the general adoption of pasteurisa- 
tion will set back improvements at the source of supply and 
encourage dirty habits. It will cause the farmers and those who 
handle the milk to believe that it is unnecessary to be quite so 
particular, as the dirt that gets into the milk is going to be cooked 
and made harmless.' 



302 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

A well-known dairyman in this country, dealing with the organi- 
sation of a safe milk supply, says : ' The process of pasteurisation, 
though apparently so simple, is in grave danger of being discredited 
by the careless and inefficient methods of some of its exponents. 
It is a most serious fact that the process, as almost universally 
conducted in this country, fails to exclude with certainty the germs 
of tubercle, and thus loses its main raison d'etre. . . . Subsequent 
dirty methods also render nugatory whatever benefit is conferred 
by the process. Such sham pasteurisation is a delusion and a snare, 
against which it behoves the public to be on their guard. Numerous 
instances are known where such milk contained more germs after 
the process than before. This is not the fault of the process, but 
the fault of the operator, his methods, equipment, and the use of 
originally inferior milk. . . . The ordinary method of pasteurisa- 
tion is to heat any old milk available, for a single instant, and 
immediately to cool it by running it over a refrigerator in a thin 
film, and whereon every drop is exposed afresh to all the impurities 
of the atmosphere. It is not surprising that milk so treated is 
often worse rather than the better for it.' 

The inefficacy of careless pasteurisation is brought out by the 
following facts quoted in a short article in the Medical Officer 
for October 9, 1915, headed ' Pasteurisation so-called.' The 
article says : ' In dealing with milks, samples of which have proved 
to be tuberculous or have been found to contain an undue proportion 
of organisms associated with excremental pollution, the Medical 
Officer of Health for Newcastle-upon-Tyne is occasionally met 
with the statement that the whole of the milk from a supply in 
question is now pasteurised and cooled at a city dairy before distribu- 
tion.' Tests made in connection with an inspection at one of the 
largest and best equipped dairies gave the following results : 
' Sample I : Original milk as received from the farm B. Coli 
present in o-ooooi c.c., the lowest degree to which the test was 
carried. Sample 2, after" pasteurisation " at 160 F., gave identical 
results, as also did sample 3, which had been " pasteurised " at 
180 C. Sample 4 was " pasteurised " at 200 F., and B. Coli was 
found in quantities down to o-oooi c.c. It is usual to classify as 
" unsatisfactory " any milk in which B. Coli is detectable in less 
quantities than o-oi c.c. In the above cases the milk merely 
passed through the apparatus, and proceeded direct to the cooler, 
so that the highest temperature reached was probably only main- 
tained for a matter of moments. The plant in question is an 
elaborate and costly one, and absolute confidence has been felt 
by the owners in its efficiency, a confidence which would be entirely 
justifiable if the operator had known how to use it.' Further 
comment on the above appears unnecessary. 

The general trend of discussions which have taken place in 
various American cities has been to show that if milk is pasteurised 
it must be carried out under supervision and must be carefully 



METHODS COMMONLY USED IN HEATING MILK 303 

conducted. The feeling of safety engendered by the belief in 
pasteurisation is very unsatisfactory if the farmer regards it as 
enabling him to use dirty methods in collecting the milk. The 
remarks in connection with the preliminary filtration which are 
given on pp. 275-7 show that this tendency cannot be neglected in 
considering the conditions of the public milk supply. 

BOILED MILK 

The border-line between pasteurised and boiled milk may 
become so fine as to be almost absent. Strictly speaking, a milk 
which is boiled must be supposed to have reached the temperature 
corresponding to the boiling-point of milk, which for the present 
purpose may be considered to be that of water. Where milk is 
heated in a water bath without pressure, the temperature of the 
milk will not reach that of the surrounding water. Where the 
water is only just raised to the boiling-point, the temperature of 
the milk is probably several degrees lower than that of the water, 
but where the water is kept at the boiling-point for some minutes, 
the temperature of the two fluids will approximate more closely, 
although the temperature of the milk will remain below that of the 
boiling water. 1 For all practical purposes, however, the milk may 
be regarded as having been boiled. 

Milk is frequently boiled without a surrounding water-jacket, 
in which case the temperature will evidently reach 100 C. and 
will fulfil the technical requirement for using the term boiled. 
Domestically, it is probable that if this method is used the tempera- 
ture is not maintained at boiling-point for any length of time, 
owing to the physical fact that the milk will boil over and tends 
to burn. Usually, therefore, the temperature will only be kept at 
this level for one or two minutes, and the milk subsequently cooled. 
Commercially, however, or on a large scale, the temperature could 
be maintained at this height for any desired length of time by 
using steam under pressure, although actually it is not attempted. 
Here also, as in the case of pasteurised milk, the length of time at 
which the temperature is maintained should be mentioned. 

STERILISED MILK 

Strictly speaking, milk thus designated should be free from all 
bacteria and from their spores. In actual fact such milk is very 
difficult to obtain. The early work of Fliigge showed many years 
ago that the spores found in milk are extremely resistant to heat, 
and that there is considerable difficulty in obtaining a really sterile 
milk. Spores are not killed by a temperature of iooC., and in 
order to destroy them it is necessary to heat the milk considerably 
over 100 C. on successive days. Very little milk thus treated is 
used for infant feeding. 

1 Cp. the data on pp. 296-7. 



304 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

The term sterilised is more frequently used to denote a milk 
which has been subjected to a somewhat prolonged boiling either 
at a temperature of 100 C. or as much below it as occurs when 
the milk is merely surrounded by boiling water. Prolonged boiling 
at this temperature does not, however, destroy spores nor certain 
of the living organisms found in milk. Only a relative degree of 
sterility is reached, although the term ' sterilised ' is very frequently 
employed. It is often impossible to determine from the literature 
when the term ' sterilised ' is used whether a prolonged heating has 
occurred, or whether it is used loosely to denote a pasteurisation 
in which the temperature has been allowed to approach that of 
boiling-point. 

The French literature deals very frequently with milk to which 
the term 'sterilise"' is applied. This usually, however, does not 
imply that the milk is absolutely sterile, i.e. that it has been super- 
heated, but that it has been kept at a high temperature, although 
perhaps below boiling-point, for a considerable period. Used in 
American literature, however, it appears usually to denote a super- 
heated milk which will presumably keep for some days at least, if not 
longer. 

In Germany the term is variously used, but appears more 
usually to denote merely boiled milk. 

In this country it is difficult to suppose that there is any rule 
at all as to terminology, and in determining the process which has 
really been used it is necessary to ascertain the method employed 
and the length of time of heating. 

DRIED MILK 

Of recent years a further method of heating milk has been used 
as a result of which the solids in the milk are obtained in the form 
of a powder. Several methods are used, two of which are described 
in Appendix F.

CHAPTER XX 

ON THE PRESENCE OF PATHOGENIC BACTERIA IN BUTTER AND 

CHEESE 

THE utilisation of milk, which is infected witn pathogenic germs, 
for the purpose of manufacturing butter or cheese has perhaps 
hardly received the attention which it deserves. There is abundant 
evidence to show that cream contains a very large percentage of 
the total bacteria which are present in milk, as the organisms 
rise to the surface with the cream. This has been shown by 
Anderson, who in the course of numerous experiments showed 
that the cream contained many times more bacteria per c.c. than 
did the rest of the fluid. In one case the figure was 500 times as 
great for the bacterial content of the cream as for that of the milk 
below it. It will be sufficient to quote one set of the figures 
obtained by him : 

Gravity Method: Centrifuged Milk. 

Cream . . . . 68,690,000 96,690,000 

Sediment .... 4,840,000 18,840,000 

Whole milk .... 14,388,000 

These figures demonstrate forcibly the high bacterial content 
of cream whether obtained by gravity or by centrifugalising. The 
effect of centrifugalising is to send more bacteria up into the cream ; 
only a small percentage of the total number are found in the 
sediment. 

Niederstadt, as quoted by Anderson, has found 75 per cent, 
of all the bacteria present in the cream. 1 

Considerable evidence has already been given in the preceding 
pages upon this well-known point. 

Butter. Evidently butter is likely to contain more bacteria than 
fresh milk when made from fresh cream. If the cream is allowed to 
go sour before utilising, it may reasonably be supposed that certain 
strains of bacteria will die out, leaving others in possession of the

306 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

field. There is no doubt as to the presence of tubercle bacilli in 
butter which has been made from tuberculous milk, and much 
work has been done upon this subject. 

A list of the authors who have investigated the presence of 
tubercle bacilli in butter is given by Newman and Swithinbank, 
and the matter has been carefully investigated by Schroeder and 
Schroeder and Cotton. 

Schroeder and Cotton state that since bacteria, and especially 
tubercle bacilli, are present in greater quantity in butter than milk, 
milk should be pasteurised before being used for butter-making 
Complete references are given by these authors. 

Objections have been raised to the pasteurisation of milk for 
the making of butter, it being stated that such milk will not 
work up satisfactorily. Babcock and Russell investigated this 
and believe that the difficulty arises from loss of viscosity of 
the cream. They found that this viscosity is much reduced by 
pasteurisation at a temperature of 140 F. or more for ten minutes. 
These observers found that the viscosity lost by the heating can 
be restored by the addition of a small amount of sucrate of lime 
(four parts to a litre). 

Roger, Berg, and Brook I. Davis investigated the temperature 
at which pasteurisation should take place in order to obtain the 
best effects for butter-making. They found that if a temperature 
below 170 F. was used, some factor appeared to remain which 
tended to cause deterioration in the quality of the butter. They 
considered that no disadvantage was incurred by raising the 
temperature above 170 F. , though above 180 F. there was a slight 
alteration in the flavour. 

Investigations have also been carried out to determine the 
length of time during which tubercle bacilli will live in butter. 
Mohler, Washburn and Rogers found that cold storage does not 
kill the bacillus when present in butter, and they showed that 
this organism when present is usually unequally distributed in the 
same piece of butter. They considered that cream should be 
pasteurised either by heating at 140 F. for twenty minutes or at 
176 F. for a moment. 

Rosenow investigated two samples of butter for streptococci 
one of the samples was found to contain a virulent strain. 

Cheese. The presence of pathogenic micro-organisms in 
cheese has also been demonstrated, and a number of observa- 
tions have been made showing that tubercle bacilli occur in this 
food. 

Thus Herman and Morgenroth, in 1898, found that in fifteen 
samples of cottage cheese, tubercle bacilli were present in three. 
Rabinowitch obtained tubercle bacilli in three out of five similar 
samples. Harrison, who investigated this question, endeavoured 
to ascertain the length of time during which tubercle bacilli will 
remain alive in cheese. He found that at the end of ten days they 



PATHOGENIC BACTERIA IN BUTTER AND CHEESE 307 

were still virulent, but it seemed possible, judging from the 
gradual decrease in virulence, that they might have died out by 
the end of four months. 

Heim believed that tubercle bacilli died after about four weeks 
in cheese. Galtier, however, found that they were still virulent 
after about seventy days. 

Mohler, Washburn, and Rogers, investigating the presence of 
tubercle bacilli which had been added to milk and subsequently 
made into cheese, considered that there was some reason to suppose 
that tubercle bacilli might die out after four months, but possibly 
a longer period might be required. 

Evidently the longevity of tubercle bacilli in cheese becomes 
important if the cheese is to be consumed within the period over 
which they are known to be virulent. Some cheeses take several 
months to ripen, but many are eaten considerably within four 
months after their manufacture has commenced. 

Difficulties have been experienced in manufacturing cheese 
from milk which has been pasteurised, but these appear to have 
been now largely overcome. Thus Liska, dealing with the manu- 
facture of cheese from pasteurised milk, used milk which had been 
heated to 65 68 C. He commenced using heated milk on 
account of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the district, 
and also apparently because the fodder given to the cattle in that 
district (and utilised both for economy and for general convenience) 
appeared to produce a milk containing many organisms and having 
a peculiar taste. (Note. The methods of collecting the milk are 
not given, but it seems probable that the bacteria were derived 
from the faeces of the cow. The fodder used was a particular 
waste from breweries which is well known to produce very liquid 
faeces, and unless the strictest cleanliness is exercised the faecal 
material which clings to the cow will almost certainly fall into 
the milk.) 

Liska kept the temperature at the above-mentioned point for 
from twenty-five to thirty minutes ; the milk was then cooled to 
the proper temperature for the addition of rennet. The results 
obtained appear to have been successful, and Liska notes that 
killing the B. Coli before utilising the milk for cheese produces a 
firmer cheese with fewer holes than that produced when B. Coli 
is present. 

Sammis and Bruhny, working in America, found that the addition 
of hydrochloric acid up to 0-25 per cent, restores the property of 
clotting to pasteurised milk and improves the flavour. They 
experimented for many years in the making of cheese with milk 
which had been pasteurised at a temperature of 160-165 F. 
If the temperature is raised much above this point, the quality 
of the cheese is stated to be affected. The authors found that 
clotting was more readily produced in the pasteurised milk by the 
addition of acid, than by the addition of a calcium salt, which, as 



3 o8 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATION. 

has been shown in Chap. XIV, restores the property of clotting to 
heated milk. The flavour of the cheese made after this manner is 
said to be excellent, and the authors recount the prizes taken by 
such cheeses at numerous shows for dairy produce.

Figures have also been published by Finkelstein and others ; 
further abundant material is available in the numerous institutions in 
foreign countries where wet-nurses are employed. All however show 
the same point, and this need not be further expanded.

APPENDIX B 

ON THE SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANISM IN RELATION 
TO THE METHOD OF FEEDING IN EARLY LIFE 

THE high infant mortality rate occurring among artificially-fed children 
as compared with breast-fed children has been referred to in Chap. VIII. 
This investigation reaches only up to the second year of life. 
Recently it has been forcibly realised that it is not sufficient to study 
the infant and its well-being up to the second year of life only, but 
that the future fate must be followed equally closely. It is important 
that the condition of the children should be known not only up to 
and during school age, but it would be of great interest to ascertain 
the effect of the method of feeding (natural or artificial) upon the next 
generation. The study of actual mortality figures would not suffice. 
It would be necessary to determine what effect the method of feeding 
might have upon general well-being in later life. Such an investiga- 
tion is complicated by a number of factors which render any complete 
work one of great difficulty For example, it must be supposed that 
the general environment will greatly affect the well-being of the 
child. The advantages of breast-feeding in the early months may, 
it must be supposed, be completely counteracted by disadvantageous 
home conditions, such as insufficient food, lack of air-space, general 
absence of cleanliness, &c., while the artificially-fed child, placed 
in good surroundings, is probably to a great extent compensated 
for the disadvantages of its feeding. Unless these factors were 
taken into consideration, the results which might be obtained by 
ascertaining the early method of feeding and the general condition of 
health of the individual in later life would almost certainly be mis- 
leading. Certain very general statements have been made by observers 
in different countries upon the capacity for breast-feeding among certain 
tribes or sections of the community in different parts of Europe, but 
none of these investigations appear to have been supported by any 
definite evidence. The observations appear to have been made from 



312 

general knowledge obtained during a residence in these parts. This 
information, although interesting, is of little value for the present 
purpose. 

The present arrangements in this country for the medical inspec- 
tion of school-children will no doubt facilitate the making of such 
observations, but the school medical officer is hampered in the first 
place by lack of time for original work, and further by the difficulty 
of ascertaining the home conditions and general surroundings of the 
child between its birth and the time it comes under medical inspection 
at school. Attempts at such investigation have doubtless been made 
by a number of these medical officers, but it would appear that only in 
one case has the investigation been recorded. 

The observations referred to have been made by Dr. Norman of the 
London County Council. A reference to this work is made in the report 
by the medical officer of the London County Council for 1913, but the 
reference is somewhat brief, and I am indebted to Dr. Norman for 
kindly allowing me to use his MS. copy, which gives a considerably 
more detailed account than that in the report referred to. The con- 
ditions of the home life were not available to Dr. Norman, although 
he made an effort to obtain such information but found it to be 
impossible. 

The investigation was made among infants of non-selected schools 
in St. Pancras and Holborn during the summer of 1913. Children 
were reckoned as having been breast-fed when this method of feeding 
alone was used for at least six months after birth. The ages of the 
children investigated ranged from three to eight years, most of them 
being from four to six years of age. The method of feeding during 
infancy of 355 children was investigated, of whom 176 were boys and 
179 girls. Dr. Norman points out the great preponderance numerically 
of the breast-fed over the bottle-fed babies, the numbers being 70.7 
per cent, and 29.3 per cent, respectively. It was noticed that the 
poorer type of children were those who had most usually been breast- 
fed. It is a matter of common knowledge that artificial feeding prevails 
among the better-to-do to a greater degree than among the very poor. 
Hence the artificially-fed child will usually have better surroundings 
than many breast-fed children. The table on p. 315 has been pre- 
pared from Dr. Norman's figures and shows fairly fully the condition 
of all the children investigated. It may be noted that without an 
exception the range both of height and weight in the groups o* breast- 
fed children is greater than that among the bottle-fed children. This 
may indicate that the poorer specimens among the breast-fed children 
survived while those in a corresponding condition among the bottle- 
fed ones did not do so. This inference, however, cannot be pressed too 
far. The weeding out of the sickly bottle-fed babies is referred to by 
Dr. Norman in his conclusions, which are as follows : 

' The superiority of breast-fed children as compared with bottle- 
fed ones is not so well marked at school age as one would be led to 
expect. It is during the early years of life, prior to school age, that 
the great advantage of breast-feeding over bottle-feeding is so apparent. 
The bottle-fed children of the poor that survive, appear to overtake 
their disadvantages, and by the time we find them in school, show no 
inferiority physically to their breast-fed fellows.' 

The investigation is of interest as being the only one of which

record has been made in this country, but in the absence of the data 
referred to, it cannot be regarded as establishing any very definite 
facts in regard to the future well-being of children in relation to their 
method of feeding. 

Breeding Experiments from Artificially-fed Guinea-pigs. Experiments 
of interest were carried out by Schroeder in order to ascertain the 
effect, if any, of the methods of feeding in the early days of life, upon 
fertility in guinea-pigs. The animals used were those already referred 
to on pp. 177-8 as having been used by Schroeder for the investiga- 
tion into the nutritive value of raw and boiled cows' milk for young 
guinea-pigs. A number of the surviving guinea-pigs were used for 
breeding purposes in order to ascertain whether artificial feeding 
could be regarded as having a detrimental effect upon fertility. The 
accompanying table shows the results.

It seems clear that there is a decreased fertility in all the artificially- 
fed groups. The more favourable results appear to be obtained in the 
case of those guinea-pigs fed on boiled milk. Schroeder points out, 
however, that some caution must be exercised in accepting the very 
unfavourable results on the raw milk series, owing to the presence in 
some of the milk of the Bacillus abortus. There is reason to believe 
that this bacillus has a prejudicial effect upon the fertility of cows, 
and it is therefore reasonable to assume that some such effect is also 
possible in the case of these pigs which may likewise have been infected 
with this organism. 

This table is one of considerable interest. It cannot necessarily 
be taken as absolutely comparable with the effects which might be 
produced in human infants fed upon cow's milk, but it is extremely 
suggestive. It also receives additional value in that, as far as I can 
ascertain, it is the only attempt which has hitherto been made to trace 
the fate of animals fed artificially for so long a period, and to endeavour 
to ascertain the effects of such feeding upon their progeny.

APPENDIX C 

THE PRESERVATION OF HUMAN MILK 

EFFORTS have been made in Germany and Austria to provide human 
milk for sickly babies where wet-nurses were either not available or not 
available in sufficient number. For this purpose women having more 
milk than is required for their own babies have been persuaded to 
express as much milk as possible and to bring it up to the hospital, 
where it is preserved in the cold room. In order to increase the length 
of time during which this milk can be kept, hydrogen peroxide has been 
added. It appears from the work of Knape and of Mayerhofer and 
Pribram that the milk can be preserved for at least twenty-four hours, 
and possibly longer. On keeping it tends to develop a musty odour 
which is rather disagreeable. Knape states, however, that the children 
fed on this milk under his care did very well. The same result also 
appeared to have been obtained by Mayerhofer and Pribram, but very 
much larger quantities of hydrogen peroxide are necessary to preserve 
the milk than in the case of cows' milk. In some cases calcodat (calcium 
peroxide) was used as a preservative. They also used this milk dried 
with varying results ; in some cases it appears to have been quite 
satisfactory. Davidsohn gives cases of children fed upon human milk 
which had been kept for twenty-four hours and mentions, as do also 
the above authors, that the milk develops a musty smell, rendering it 
less agreeable to the older children, although the younger ones did not 
appear to dislike it.

TABLES AND ADDITIONAL DATA RELATING TO THE BERLIN MATERIAL 

Results obtained by Working up the Material. In working up the 
material which had been obtained from the Berlin consultation the 
first point was to add the weights of all the babies of each series at 
the same day of life, and then divide by the number of babies weighed, 
thus obtaining the average weight of the babies under consideration 
at the same day of life. 

The average weights so obtained showed considerable inequalities, 
and the number of them was unwieldy and cumbersome. It was

therefore decided to take the unit of age as eight days, and to group 
together all the weights of the babies from 1-8, 9-16 days of age and so 
on up to 368 days of age. 

The total weights of all the babies which were weighed in each eight- 
day period of life were divided by the total number of babies weighed. 
Thus the average weight of all the babies of each series for consecutive 
periods of eight days of life up to one year of age was obtained, the in- 
equalities of the averages for each day being thus smoothed out and 
the number of average weights reduced to a convenient number for 
plotting on a curve. 

No serious overlapping of weighings was produced by this method, 
since the babies were usually brought up at intervals of eight or ten 
days, so that it was only in exceptional cases that the weight of the 
same baby was recorded twice in any period of eight days. 

Appended are subsidiary tables and curves which deal more fully 
with the material used and which may be regarded as supplementary 
to the information given in Chap. XI. 

Table I shows the results obtained by thus working up the 
babies of the control or breast-fed series, and Table II the corre- 
sponding results for the babies of the boiled cows' milk series. 
In these tables 

Column I. shows the age in periods of eight days of the babies 

considered. 

Column II. gives the number of observations, i.e. the number 
of babies which were weighed upon each of the consecu- 
tive days of each period of eight days ; the figures being 
given in chronological order. 
Column III. gives the total number of observations (weighings) 

in each period of eight days, as given in Column I. 
Column IV. gives the average weight of the babies of each 
series for each period of eight days corresponding to the 
period of Column I. 

NOTE. As regards Column II., in collecting the weights of 
the babies the weights were worked up for each day 
separately up to 100 days of age, from 100-224 days of 
age they were worked up in two-day periods, and from 
224-368 days the weights were worked up in four-day 
periods. This is shown in the tables. 

The average weights found, and shown in Tables I and II, are 
plotted on Diagrams, p. 196. 

The total number of observations worked up for the cases in Series I. 
amount to 6297 and for Series II. to 544^. 

The percentage rate of growth of babies of both series. It seemed 
desirable to study the rate of growth of the babies of the two series 
dealt with in this report. 

This was done in the following ways : 

(1) By estimating the percentage increase per kilo, of body- 

weight during each period of "eight days, each series 
being taken separately. 

(2) The rate at which growth took place as measured by the time 

required by the babies of each series for the doubling 
of the initial average weight, the values of the first 
eight-day period being omitted on account of the small

of babies fed upon boiled cows' milk as compared with 
the weights of the breast-fed babies. The weights of 
the breast-fed babies being taken as 100. 

The results of the first method are given in Table III and are plotted 
on Diagram 9, p. 198. Both series show an extreme irregularity in the 
rate at which the weight increases, but after the first two estimations 
it would be difficult to point out any marked difference between the 
values of the two series.

The results of the second method are shown in Table IV, and 
have been plotted on Diagram 10, p. 200, which shows that as regards 
rate of growth there is little to choose between the two series. The 
babies fed upon boiled cow's milk doubled their weight at the i85~i92nd 
day, or a fortnight earlier than the breast-fed babies, but they started 
with an initially lower weight, since the first value was omitted, on 
account of the small number of observations.

The third method, giving the percentage deficit of the average 
weights of the babies fed upon boiled cows' milk as compared with 
the breast-fed babies, showed that at no period of life does the deficit 
exceed 10 per cent., and that during the greater part of the period 
under observation the deficit is much less. 



APPENDIX E 321 



APPENDIX E 

THE MILK DEPOTS OF ENGLAND 

IT seemed advisable to add a short note upon the existing milk depots 
in this country. It is not necessary to enter into any detail of the 
history of milk depots in general, which has been already dealt with 
by numerous authors. 1 

A list of the milk depots and their condition in 1913 was given 
by the Medical Officer to the Local Government Board in his second 
report on Infant and Child Mortality. It was then shown that there 
had been in England thirteen depots, the first established being at 
St. Helens, opened in 1899. Of these milk depots three had been closed 
before 1913, the remainder being still open. Of the remaining ten, 
two were conducted by voluntary agencies and eight by municipal 
authorities. Since that date a voluntary milk depot has been estab- 
lished in Sydenham and arrangements for supplying milk in various 
forms are now in existence in connection with certain municipalities and 
with a number of voluntary agencies. 

Until the introduction of dried milk, the milk supplied from milk 
depots was almost universally prepared from raw milk. This milk 
was obtained as far as possible from a farm where the methods of collec- 
tion were believed to be satisfactory, and was delivered once a day at 
the milk depot. Here it was prepared in several set modifications for 
children of different ages, and in bottles considered to be of suitable size 
for the ages of children for whom the milk formulae were prepared. 
The bottles were then subjected to heat in a steam steriliser, the tempera- 
ture usually being kept somewhat below that of boiling water. After 
heating, the milk was rapidly cooled by passing cold water through 
the apparatus, and the milk given out in a small crate capable of holding 
a number of bottles corresponding to the number of feeds prescribed 
for the infant. 

This method of dealing with milk still obtains in six milk depots in 
this country. Apart from these, in one case the milk is not subjected 
to heat but is given raw, and in the remaining three dried milk is now 
exclusively used. 

In addition, as has been already indicated in several chapters, a large 
amount of dried milk is utilised in connection with the infant consulta- 
tions in Sheffield and elsewhere. 

Cost of the Milk Depot. The method of preparing boiled or pas- 
teurised milk in small bottles is a very expensive one. The cost of the 
mi nipulation and establishment charges for the milk depot far exceed 
the actual cost of the material. It is usual to obtain, as far as possible, 
a payment from the mothers for whose children the milk is available, 
which would cover the actual cost of the milk, the difference between 
the total cost and the sum obtained being borne by the rates. The 
cost per head does not appear to diminish appreciably with the increased 
number of children for whom the milk is prepared. The actual^cost 

1 Cp. McLeary (Milk and Milk Depots) and others. 



322 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

to the rates was given in the annual report of the Medical Officer to the 
Local Government Board already referred to. 

The use of dried milk for infants removes any difficulty connected 
with the cost of preparation. The dried milk is usually bought whole- 
sale and sold at a price that will just cover any incidental expenditure 
connected with its provision and sale. As a whole this form of milk 
appears to approximate closely in cost to that of ordinary milk 
obtained from a dairy and no expenditure need be incurred. In 
Leicester a profit is even made by the sale of the dried milk at the 
municipal depot. 

Apart from the relative and nutritive values of either boiled or 
dried milk, the provision of dried milk removes some of the drawbacks 
of the milk depot, where the milk is prepared in bottles. The milk 
depot where the milk is either boiled or pasteurised is not as popular 
with the mothers as is the dried milk depot. In the one case the milk 
must be fetched daily and in the other a sufficient amount can be 
obtained to last a week or more if necessary. Moreover the mother 
learns nothing as to the methods of infant feeding when the milk is 
provided for her ready prepared in bottles for each feed. Where 
dried milk is used she has to prepare the milk according to the directions 
given her at the depot. 

Neither form of milk depot should be regarded as providing a 
generally satisfactory method for the feeding of infants apart from 
medical supervision. The provision of a good milk supply is not a 
panacea for infant mortality, and a mother's natural intelligence 
does not teach her how to feed a child artificially nor even naturally. 
She requires instruction, more especially when artificial feeding has to 
be resorted to. In Sheffield, dried milk is only provided for those 
mothers who attend the infant consultation and for whom the presiding 
doctor prescribes the method of feeding. No form of artificial feeding, 
whet er by dried milk or from a milk depot, should be resorted to for 
children of tender age unless it is clearly established that the mother 
cannot feed the child naturally. Unless proper medical supervision 
is intimately connected with the supply of milk from a municipal milk 
depot, a tendency to artificial feeding is almost unavoidable, although 
it may be difficult to establish any definite cessation of breast-feeding 
on account of the facility with which the mother can obtain milk, 
which is regarded in a sense an official hall-mark of quality. 




THE methods of desiccation of milk have been described by several 
authors, but the notes below are taken from the work of Prof. Delepine 
(Report to the L.G.B., New Series, No. 97). 

Two methods are described. 

First Method. The accompanying diagram represents the stages 
in the process.

The drying apparatus consists of two cylinders placed side by side, 
the space between them not exceeding 2 millimetres. They rotate 
in opposite directions at a speed of six to fourteen revolutions per 
minute. They are heated by steam under pressure at a temperature 
of i39-i4i C. for whole milk or rather lower for separated milk. The 
steam enters through pipe V. The milk enters through pipe L, the out- 
flow through d being regulated. It falls into the gutter a when it 
passes into a state of ebullition. The temperature of the milk during 
the short time it was in the gutter was found to remain below 
100 C. 




Figure showing the first method of desiccation: 



The milk passes out from the gutter in a thin layer which 
rapidly dries in a pellicle on the surface of the rotating cylinder. 
By the time that two-thirds (approximately) of a revolution has been 
accomplished the milk is sufficiently dry to be separated in a continuous 
ribbon by means of the long straight blades at r. The ribbon falls 
into the chamber C, whence it is removed, powdered, and packed in 
tins. 

Second Method. This method is described by Prof. Detepine as 
follows (see diagram on next page) : 

' i. The milk on arriving from the farm is poured into a large 
vessel, the outlet of which is provided with a strainer ; this vessel is 
also used to weigh the milk. 

' 2. The strained milk is allowed to mix in a large tank from which 
it is admitted to 

' 3. A heater, where it is wanned before passing to 

1 Cp. also pp. 225-6.

' 4. The separator. The separated milk may be dried separately, 
in which case the cream is removed. When dried whole milk is wanted 
the separated milk and cream are brought together again in a common 
channel which carries the milk to 

' 5. A pasteurising apparatus where the temperature of the fluid is 
raised from 70 C. to 75 C. When separated milk is treated the tem- 
perature is raised slightly above 75 C. 

' 6. The pasteurised milk is collected in a large vacuum pan, where 
it is heated by steam to a temperature of about 58 C. and is reduced 
to a little less than one-half of its original bulk. When the milk has 
reached a suitable consistency its temperature is rapidly raised to 95 C., 
and as soon as this point is reached the temperature is brought down 
again to 58 C. 

' 7. According tothe amount of milk in the vacuum pan the condens- 
ng process occupies from two to two and a half hours. 




Figure illustrating the 2nd method of desiccation. 



' 8. The condensed milk is drawn into metal cylinders from which 
it is immediately pumped into 

' 9. A small tank, from which the fluid passes into 

' 10. A powerful pump, which forces it under a pressure of 2000 
to 3000 Ibs. through the 

'ii. Spraying apparatus, by which a cone of finely sprayed milk is 
produced. This takes place in the middle of an opening to which a 
current of dry air heated to 115 C. is brought by 

'12. A large pipe. Both the hot air and the spray are projected into 

' 13. A tin-lined chamber, the internal temperature of which is 76- 
81 C. The droplets of milk dry as they fall to the floor, upon which 
they rapidly form a layer of granules of dry milk. 

' The current of hot air passes out of this first room into a second 
room, where the particles which have not fallen in the first room are 
collected. 

When the desired amount of milk has been dried, the drying-room

is emptied through an opening in the floor, and the milk powder it 
collected in 

'14. Metal cylinders. 

' 15. It is afterwards sifted through a fine gaure screen. The milk 
is then packed in suitable receptacles.'

NOTES ON THE GRADING OF MILK 

THE efforts which have been made in various countries to improve the 
general milk supply, have led those concerned to endeavour to establish 
a standard for milk in order to obtain and maintain a satisfactory milk 
supply. The American Medical Milk Commissions have perhaps done 
more than other bodies in the investigation of the regulations which 
should be laid down in order to obtain satisfactory grades of milk. 

The Commissions of the various States of America have adopted 
their own standards, in some measure, but there are some points 
upon which there is very general agreement, and for which similar 
standards have been adopted by the majority of the commissions. 

Fundamentally, the standards are based upon the bacterial count 
of the milk. In addition, standards are laid down for the fat content, 
and for the total solids, which must be found in any sample of milk. 
Attempts have been made also to obtain a test for the amount of dirt 
present, which would enable some sort of standardisation to be made. 
The standardisation of the leucocyte count has also been contem- 
plated, but does not appear as yet to have reached a definite issue. 
Recent investigations appear rather to show the difficulty of establishing 
any such standard. 

Grades of Milk. The highest grade of milk produced in America 
is very generally known as ' certified ' milk. Numerous regulations 
have been drawn up for the production of this milk, and the Com- 
missions, after due investigation of the conditions under which the milk 
is produced, pass certain farms which conform to the required standards, 
permitting them to state that the milk is of this quality for a certain 
period. The bacterial count and the chemical composition of the 
milk are regularly investigated. If the result of these examinations 
is satisfactory, the permission is renewed : if unsatisfactory, it is 
withdrawn. 

It is impossible for the general milk supply to reach this standard. 
The cost of production is considerably higher than can be met by the 
farmer for the prices of ordinary market milk. It has been necessary 
therefore to introduce lower grades of milk which can be sold at a 
cheaper rate than ' certified ' milk, but over which some control is also 
exercised. The different States and cities have issued their own 
regulations for grading, and it is not proposed to deal with these 
individually. It seemed, however, of interest to give some brief notes 
showing the nature of the standards laid down. The State of New York 
issued regulations which came into force in November 1914 and which 
described explicitly the nature of the grades in milk. Briefly they 
amount to the following : 



326 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

Grade A. Raw. This milk must not at any time previous to the 
delivery to the consumer contain more than 60,000 bacteria per c.c. 
and such cream not more than 300,000 bacteria per c.c. It must be 
delivered within thirty-six hours from the time of milking, unless a 
shorter time shall be prescribed by the local authorities. It must be 
delivered to customers only in containers sealed at the dairy, and must 
show its grade and the name and address of the dealer. 

Grade A. Pasteurised. Such cream or milk before pasteurisation 
must not contain more than 200,000 bacteria per c.c. After pasteurisa- 
tion and previous to the delivery to the consumer it must not contain 
more than 30,000 per c.c. in the milk and 150,000 per c.c. in the cream. 
It must be delivered in sealed containers and labelled ' Grade A. 
Pasteurised.' 

Grade B. Raw. Such milk must not at any time previous to 
delivery to the consumer contain more than 200,000 bacteria per c.c. 
and such cream not more than 750,000 bacteria per c.c. Regulations 
as to delivery as for Grade A. 

Grade B. Pasteurised. Such cream or milk before pasteurisation 
must not contain more than 300,000 bacteria per c.c. After pasteurisa- 
tion such milk must not at any time contain more than 100,000 bacteria 
per c.c. and such cream not more than 500,000 per c.c. The milk 
must be delivered within thirty-six hours after pasteurisation and 
such cream within forty-eight hours after pasteurisation. It must be 
labelled 'Grade B.' 

Grade C. Raw and Pasteurised. This grade has no prescribed 
bacterial standard, but must be delivered within forty-eight hours 
from the time of milking in the case of the raw milk or within forty- 
eight hours after pasteurisation. 

The cows from which the milk of Grade A is obtained must have 
been tested at least once in the previous year with tuberculin, and any 
tuberculous cow must be excluded from the herd. 

For Grade B the cows must be healthy, as disclosed by an annual 
physical examination. 

The farms producing all these classes of milk are subjected to inspec- 
tion and are themselves graded by a system of score cards. By this 
method marks are allowed for the various items concerned in the produc- 
tion of milk, and farms supplying Grade A milk must reach a higher 
percentage of marks than those supplying milk of Grade B, and these 
again a higher percentage than those supplying milk of Grade C. 

The regulations issued by the Department of Health for the city of 
New York define milk of Grade A as being suitable for infants and 
children, Grade B suitable for adults, and Grade C for cooking and 
manufacturing purposes only. 

The regulations of New York City for the farms and dairies con- 
nected with the milk supply are extremely detailed. 

In this country individual investigators have examined the most 
suitable standards for improving the general milk supply. Regula- 
tions as to the fat content of milk have been in force for some years, 
but no regulations as to bacterial or other standards exist at the present 
time. 

Savage, reporting upon the measurement of milk pollution based 
upon a bacterial standard, did not come to very definite conclusions, 
but it seems probable from his work and from that of Houston, com- 



APPENDIX H 327 

bined with the experience obtained in other countries, that a bacterial 
standard affords more control over the care which has been exercised 
in the collection of the milk, than any other method.

APPENDIX H 

ON METHODS USED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF BACTERIA IN MILK 
WITHOUT THE APPLICATION OF HEAT 

AT different times methods have been brought forward which should 
destroy the bacteria in milk without the application of heat. It 
may be said at once that none of them has been widely used. All have 
drawbacks or difficulties, and the excellent results obtained in the 
feeding of infants, by using milk which has been heated in the home, 
or (at the present time) dried, render it unlikely that any other 
known method will receive wide acceptance. 

One of the main difficulties arises in preventing the re-contamina- 
tion of the milk after treatment, and the further danger that it should 
as commercial pasteurisation may also do tend to encourage care- 
lessness or uncleanliness in the course of production. 

Towards the end of last century Budde suggested the addition of 
hydrogen peroxide to milk in order to preserve it, and to destroy 
the bacteria. This method gained some little vogue on the Continent, 
especially in Germany, but it appears to have been almost, if not 
completely, abandoned at the present time. It was claimed that the 
milk remained in effect ' raw ' milk, and that the ' vital ' properties 
were not destroyed. At that time the investigations which have 
been dealt with in the preceding chapters had not been made, and 
scientific knowledge as to the artificial feeding of infants was in a 
rudimentary state. Hydrogen peroxide is split up by catalase, whether 
this ferment is present in the milk as such or due to subsequent bacterial 
action. Where sufficient of the reagent is added bacterial growth is 
inhibited. Difficulty arises in determining how much should be added 
to milk when the total bacterial content is unknown. Hydrogen 
peroxide has a very disagreeable taste, so that it is necessary to add 
only as much as may be required for the purpose of an antiseptic. 

As the physicians of Germany gained experience in the feeding 
of infants and found the excellent results which are obtained by the 
use of milk which is heated in the homes, attention was diverted from 
the need for Buddisation, and the recent literature contains no mention 
of this method. 



328 MILK AND ITS HYGIENIC RELATIONS 

In this country there is still a section of people who cling to the 
belief in the ' vital ' properties of milk (said to be destroyed by heat) 
as essential elements in the successful feeding of infants. The results 
obtained all around them by the use of pasteurised, boiled, or dried 
milk fail to convince them of the absence of such properties. 

Doubtless much of this attitude of mind arises from the fact that 
the scientific literature dealing with the subject is for the most part 
in foreign periodicals, and the pressure of daily life does not encourage 
acquaintance with the results obtained by other methods. 

This sentiment has recently found expression in an experiment 
conducted by the Liverpool Corporation to sterilise milk used at their 
infant milk depots by electricity. The work was carried out by 
Prof. Beattie and his assistants, and the results investigated from 
various standpoints. 

There seems no doubt that the method is entirely satisfactory in 
destroying as high a percentage of bacteria as is effected by pasteurisa- 
tion. The report made to the City of Liverpool in 1914 showed, that 
over a period of fifteen days the percentage of bacteria destroyed 
reached an average of 99*93 per cent. Special mention is made of the 
destruction of the acid-forming organisms ; and tubercle bacilli were 
destroyed in some experiments in which the organisms had been 
added to he milk. The milk is said to keep extremely well after the 
treatment, and it is further 'claimed that the ' enzymes are not 
destroyed.' The nature of [the enzymes is not stated, but in view 
of the experiences already recorded in the previous pages, the whole 
question is immaterial. 

The more important features ofj the method are shown in 
Plate VIII. 

The milk is poured into a large tank and is passed gradually into 
the ' lethal ' tube. The rate of passage is regulated to ensure a 
sufficient duration of the treatment. After passing through the tube 
the milk is at once bottled. 

The re-oontamination of the milk must be avoided as in the case 
of pasteurised milk, and the bottles must be cleaned and sterilised as 
in the case of pasteurisation. There is however the added risk of 
contamination during manipulation, which risk has been found to be a 
very real one, and has led to the abandonment of the method at the 
milk depots. 

It is possible that this method might be of value for commercial 
purposes. As, however, the plant is expensive, and must be worked 
by a competent engineer (owing to the high electric potential of the 
currents used and to the complicated apparatus), it is unlikely, in view 
also of the cost of the electric current, that this would be found cheaper 
than the use of heat. 

Another method has recently been introduced in Germany, and 
has proved a source of much discussion. The apparatus, which is 
known as the ' Biorisator,' consists of a double-walled chamber, the 
milk being heated by means of steam at 75 C. The milk is passed 
in, in a fine jet in the form of a spray and is said to retain all 
the properties of raw milk. The discussion arose between various 
investigators who were unable to find much reduction in the bacterial 
content in the milk stated to have been purified by this method. It 
seemed probable that here also a difficulty had arisen in regard to 



PLATE VIII.

apparatus and partly in the process of bottling. 1
