PREFACE. 



(Tiie receipts In the " pA'cry-day Cookery Book " are chiefly intended 

for persons of moderate income ; though amongst them will be found 
[some few which are expensive and elaborate. ■ 

The instructions in cookery are given in very full detail for the con- 
Ivenience of inexperienced housekeepers and cooks. For the same 
[reason the nearest possible approximation to the time required for 

cooking the various dishes has bt^jn given; while the coloured plates 
I will educate the eye of the cook, and en'^ble her to judge how her 

preparations should look. 

Thai the book may answer the purpose for which it is intended is 

the earnest hope of the Editor.

WARNE'S 
EVERY-DAY COOKERY. 



THE MISTRESS OF A FAF^^LY. 



TllF. mistress of a family commands daily a 
small realm of which she is queen. Let 
her rule with justice, meekness, and quiet- 
ness. The most self-governed person will 
always govern best, and we should have 
fewer bad servants if they were all under 
the firm and patient training of an employer 
who understood what their duties really 
were, ?.nd required the best fulfilment of 
them, compatible with the frailty of human 
nature. 

Good temper, patience, and a knowledge 
of domestic matters, come first therefore in 
the list of requirements for a model house- 
wife. 

After these, we shall name early rising, 
which is very important. 

A lady will find it best to give her servants 
orders for the day, before breakfast, if con- 
venient, and, to do this well, she must visit 
the larder herself early that she may judge 
of what is required. Her cook should have 
a book-slate and pencil, and enter the orders 
for dinner on one leaf of it, that there may 
be no mistakes made in them. On the 
other leaf she should be ordered to enter 
daily the amount of milk, bread, &c., 
bought on the previous day, which the 
mistWs sliould then transfer to her common- 
place book, to be entered in the account- 
book at the end of the week. 

She should pay all her bills, if possible, 
every week. If some few remain to be paid 
quarterly, she should not on that account 
delay to examine them weekly, and to make 
up the week's accounts. She will then be 
sure of her exper.diture. 

She must take care that the butcher always 
brings a ticket of weight with the meat ; 
and have those weight tickets brought to 
her weekly in order that she may compare 
them with the entries in her book. All 
meat brought into the house should be 
Wcif^licd to iSc'.: ii the Uckct i3 coiTcct, and 



for this purpose a pair of scales should be 
kept in the kitchen ; groceries, &c., should 
also be tested as to weight on receipt of 
them. 

She should ascertain the price of every 
article of food in her neighbourhood ; as 
prices differ with localities, and that which 
might be economical food in one place is 
frequently the reverse in another. In order 
to learn the prices, she must not disdain to 
market for herself, if she is her own house- 
keeper. She will thus be able by personal 
observation to learn which are the best shops 
for different articles, and what arc the fair 
rates of payment for them. It is also 
essential that a housekeeper should know 
the average weekly consumption for food of 
each person in an ordinary fiiniily, that she 
may be able to check waste and provide 
provisions for any period .she may desire. 
For this purpose we subjoin a list of the 
usual allowances, which will of course vary 
very much from differing circumstances ; 
but it will give a general idea on the subject, 
which personal experience will modify :— 

Food for one Person Weekly. 

Tea, two ounces. 

Coffee, a quarter of a pound (if for break- 
fast only). 

Cocoa paste, a quarter of a pound, for 
breakfasts. 

Sugar, half a pound. 

Cheese, half a pound. 

Butter, half a pound. 

Milk, one quart ; varying with the taste 
of the fixmily. 

Bread, eight pounds for a woman, si.xtecn 
pounds for a man or boy. 

Meat, six pounds. 

Beer, one gallon for a woman, seven 
quarts for a man. 

PottUocs, three and a half pounds. 



Hint:i to Housekeepers. 



J 



?? 



I i;. 



Of course this estimate of quantities must 
be moditicd greatly by the habits and tastes 
of the nimily, and by the fact of residence 
euner in tlie town or country. 

A large supply of vegetables, fish, or 
puddmgs will greatly reduce the scale of 
"H'at ; and making tea and coffee for num- < 
l>ers will reduce the amount of those articles. ' 
VVe merely give this general ?dea of quantity 
to guide, ma measure, the inexperienced 
^^i ^Y^^'^o^'dhave been thankful 
lOr such knowledge ourselves, us without it 



one invariably buys more than is actually 
needed for the consiuiiption of the houst 
hold. 

With regard to meat, an allowance must 
be made for its waste in cooking (of which 
a table is given in this work), and also f,,r 
the weight of bone found in every joint v 
te])t buttock of beef.

HOW TO MARKET. 



Wc advise our lady housekeepers to 

narket for themselves ; but as some skill is 

[^quired in a purchaser (if this duty is to be 

licriormcd to advantage), we will endeavour 

io give directions by which aiexi)erienced 

liouscwives may be enabled to ciioosc good 

Eirticlcs. 

r'irst in the list comes butcher's meat ; of 



which beef is considered the best by the 
generality of English people. An ox sliould 
be ke|)t five or six years before it is killed ; 
it is then in its jM-iine. Ox-bccf is the best. 
It is a fine grained meat ; the lean of a 
bri,i;ht red colour, intermingled wuh grams 
of f.it, when it is well fed and good. Tiie 
fat should be white, not yellow, and the

suet also white and firm. Beef should never 
be lean ; it is tough and bad unless there is 
a good quantity of fat. Hcifer-becf is paler 
thnn ox-beef, and closer grained ; the fat 
wiiiter, and the bones, of course, smaller. 
Bull-beef is only described to be avoided. 
It is dark-coloured and coarse-grained ; has 
very little fat, and a strong meaty smell 
about ii. 

Of these joints choose the rib or sirloin, 
for roasting. If you purchase ribs of beef, 
let them be the middle ribs. You may have 



one, two, three, or four ribs, as you will ; 
but one rib is too thin to be economical, as 

I it dries up in cooking. If, however, your 

■ family l)e sm;ill, a single rib. with the bones 
taken out, rolled nnd stuffed, will make a 
nice little roast. If you buy a sirloin, tak: 
care to have it cut from the chump end 
wiiich hns a good under cut or fillet, a

fepicnres ; but it is too large to serve whole. 
fi. sufficiently large joint is cut from the 
bhump end to roast. 

I-'or the servants' hall, or as a dinner for a 
large family where economy is essential, 
;]ic buttock of beef is e.xcellent, and very 
Jirufitable. It is cheaper than the other 
roasting portions of the ox, has no bones, 
^nd affords quantities of rich gravy. But 
It should be hung for sometime until quite 
lender. The round, aitch-bone, and silver- 
Bide are u.sually salted and boiled. The 
iieck is used for making souji or gravy— ask 
Mor it as " gravy beef ;" the thin tlank is the 
fcart to be collared. A "rumpsteak" is to 
:^be ordered for frying, &c. A "beefsteak" 
idoes for stewing, pudilings, pies, &c. The 
'inferior and cheaper pai ts of beef make ex- 



cellent bonilli—^. dish for which you will 
find directions in the body of the book. 

Vkal should be small and pink, and the 
kidney well covered with fat. The calf 
shoukl not be older than eight or ten weeks 
when it is killed, or the llesh will be coarse. 
If veal is large it should be cheaper, as it is 
less delicate. The flesh should be dry, 
closely grained, ;inil pinky ; if it is moist 
and clammy it is stale, and not fit for cook- 
ing. 

'I he fillet, loin, shoulder, and best end of 
the neck, are the roasting joints. The 
breast is sometinies roastod in very small 
f.imilies, but it is usually stewed, as is also 
the knuckle ; or the knuckle may be boiled, 
and serveil with parsley and butter. .\ 
calf's head is a delicacy. Calf's feet are

also vahiable boiled, stewed, or used for 
jelly. Veal, makes the best stock for rich 
soups and gravies. It is a most useful meat 
for made dishes of all kinds, on account of 
its delicate flavour. 

Mutton.— Wether mutton is the best. 
It may be known by its having a knob of fat 
on the upper part of the lel,^ It should be 
c'ark-coloured, and have plenty of fat. The 
colour is important, as it is a jiroof of age, 
and the older mutton is the better it is. It 
should, properly, be the flesh of a sheep 
four or five years old, to be in perfection, 
but such meat is rarely to be bouglit at 
a butcher's ; one tastes it only at the iiouses 



of coimtry gentlemen who kill their own 
animals. 

All the joints of a sheep may be roasted. 
The saddle is the best. The haimch is ne.xt 
l)est to the .saddle ; it is the leg and loin un- 
divided. The leg and neck are frequently 
boiled. The leg and loin, separated, are 
the best joints after the haunch. Chops are 
cut from the loin ; cutlets from the thick end 
of the loin, best end of the neck, or middle 
of the leg. The leg is soiuctimcs cured and 
smoked as a ham. The breast of mutton is 
often salted and boiled. The scrag end of 
mutton is very good stewed with rice. 

Lamd should be small ; of a pale-coloured

I red, and fat. Lamb is generally roasted. 

The leg of "house-lamb" (which is in 
[season just before Christmas), is sometimes 
[boiled and served with white sauce. 

Vknison is not very often bought, but 
I when it is you can tell iis to its being "high" 

or not, by running a skewer iiuo the shoiildor, 

and observing tiie scent on it when witii- 
I drawn. The fat should be thick and clean. 

If the cleft of the haimch is smooth and 
j close, the animal is young. 

Pork. — Buy pork of a respectable 
[ butcher ; or get it from some place w liere 



you know it has been carefully fed ; from a 
dairy farm is tlie best place, or from a 
miller's, or even from some country neigh- 
bour, as diseased or bad pork is very dan- 
gerous food. The fat of jiork should be 
firm, and the lean white, and fuiely grained. 
Tlie rind or skin thin and smooth. If tlie 
flesh feels clammy to the touch, the pork is 
bad. If the fat has kernels in it, the pig has 
been measly, and the meat should not he 
eaten. Pork should he perfectly hweet to be 
good, therefore do not liang it long.

thin, the fat firm and pinkisli, the lean 
tender and adlierinij to tlic bone. Rusty 
bacon has yellow strt-aks in it. 

Hams arc tried by sticking a knife or 
skewer into them up to the knuckle ; if 
when drawn out it has a nice smell, the 
ham is good. A bad scent will be perceived 
if it is tainted. 

The roasting joints of pork are the spare 
rib, loin, and leg ; the other joints are 
salted ; the leg may also be cured and 
boiled. 'I'he sides or flitches are made into 
bacon. The leg makes a ham. 

Meat should be wiped with a dry, clean 
cloth as soon as it comes from the butcher's ; 
flyblows should be cut out, and in loins, the 
long pipe that runs by the bone bhould be 
taken out, as it soon taints ; the kernels 
also should be removed from beef. Never 
receive bniisedjomis. If you wish to keep 
your meat hanging longer than ordinary, 
dredge it well with pepper. Powdered 
charcoal dusted over it will also prevent its 
tainting, nay, will absolutely remove the 
taint from meat already gone. We have 
seen a pair of fowls quite green from un- 
avoidably long keeping, made fresh and 
sweet as ever by being sprinkled with pow- 
dered charcoal for an hour before dressing. 
In hot summers it is very advisable to keep 
a. lump of charcoal in the larder. Meat 
becomes more digestible and tender by 
hanging, but lamb and veal cannot be kept 
so well as beef and mutton. Remember 
that the best, and therefore the dearest 
joints are the most economical in the end, 
because they contain more solid meat than 
the others ; but viiry large joints are not 
economical for a small family ; nor are they 
as wholesome as our old-fashioned English 
prejudices once deemed them. 

Poultry and Game, to Choose. 

Turkey. — The cock bird, when young, 
has a smooth black leg with a short spur. 
The eyes are bright and full, and the feet 
supple, when fresh ; the absence of these 
signs denotes age and staleness ; the hen 
may be judged by the same rules. 

Fowls. — The young cock has a smooth 
leg and a short spur ; when fresh, the vent 
is close and dark. Hers, when young, have 
smooth legs and combs ; when old, these 
will be rough ; a good capon has a thick 
belly and large rump, a poll comb, and a 
swelling breast. 

Geese.— In young geese the feet and 
bills will be yellow, and free from hair. 
When fresh, the feet are pliable ; they are 
stiil when stale. 

Ducks may be selected by the same rules. 

Pigeons, when fresh, have supple feet, 



and the vent will be firm ; if discoloured 
they are stale. 

Plovers, when fat, have hard vents ; but 
like almost all other birds, may be chosen 
by the above rules. 

Uauks. — When a hare is young and 
fresh, the cleft in the lip is narrow, the body 
stiff, and the claws are smooth and sharp ; 
old and stale hares will be the opposite of 
this. Rabbits the same. In order to ascer- 
tain whether a hare is young or old, turn 
the claws sideways ; if they crack it is 
young. The ears also should be tender and 
capable of bending easily. 

Pakikidges.— Yellow logs and a dark 
bill are signs by which a young bird may be 
known ; a rigid vent when iresh. When 
this part is green the bird is stale. 

Pheasants may be chosen as above ; 
the young birds are known by the short or 
round spur, which in the old is long and 
pointed. 

Moor Game. — Grouse, Woodcocks, 
Snipes, Quails, Ortolans, &c., may be 
chosen by the rules above given. 

Choose white legged fowls for boiling, 
and dark for roasting. 

To Choose Fish. 

The eyes of fish, if fresh, are bright, the 
gills of a fine clear red, the body stiff, and 
the smell not unpleasant. Chloride of soda 
will restore fish that is not extremely fresh, 
but it is never so good as when it has not 
been kept. 

A turbot shou.d be thick ; the under side 
of a [lale yellowish white, the colour of rich 
cream. 

The salmon and the cod should have a 
small head, very thick shoulders, and a 
small tail. The flesh of the salmon should 
be of a bright red colour, the scales very 
bright. 

Uo not buy herrings, mackerel, or whi- 
tings unless quite fresh, and do not attempt 
to keep them even till the next day. Cod 
may be kept twenty-four hours. Soles the 
same. 

Eels should be bought alive. Crabs and 
lobsters should be heavy and very stiff : if 
they feel limp they are stale. They are 
often bought alive. Oysters, if fresh, will 
close forcibly on the knife when openc#. 
If the shell gapes in the least degree, the 
oyster is losing its freshness. When the 
hsh is dead the shell remains open. Small 
"natives" are the best oysters for eating ; 
for sauces or other culinary purposes the 
larger kinds are good enough. 

To Choose Eggs. 
Shake the eggs ; if they are bad they will

canille ; if quite fresh there are no spots , 
upon the shells, and they have a bnlliant j 
licht yellow tint." , , , , 

Eggs to be preserved for use should be I 
j7«7« fresh from the nest. 

To Choose Vegetables. 

Take care that they are fresh-looking and 

" Potatoes.- IF^ think the best arc the 
walnut-leaf kidney for summer and the 
regents for winter use. But tastes difter so 
much with regard to potatoes, that we can 
only advise buying them of the best anu 
most respectable dealers. 

To Choose Apples. 

In choosing apples, be guided by the 
wei-^ht ; the heaviest are the best, and those 
should always be selected which, on bemg 
pressed bv the thumb, yield to it with a 
slight ciMckling noise. Prefer large apples 
to small, for waste is saved in peeling and 
coring them. , , . _ 

Apples should be kept on dry straw in a 
dry place, and pears hung up by the stalk. 

The Store-Eooin. 

Every lady should have a small closet for 
her stores if she has not a regular store- 
room. Groceries should always be bought 
in quantities, if possible ; thus the turn of 
the scale and the weight of paper, bic, is 
saved. At certain seasons of the year some 
articles may be bought cheaper than at 
others. Advantage should be taken of any 
fall in the market. 

A book should be kept in the store-room 
to enter the date when each store is bought, 
and at what price. 

The storeroom should be very dry, and 
furnished with drawers, shelves, and nails 
with a few little nets suspended from them 
for hanging lemons in. It should contain 
also earthenware jars for sugars, and tins toi 
keeping tea, coffee, and biscuits. The largo 
or small tins in which biscuits are sold 



should be retained for those u<^c-?. Jams, 
pickles, and prcsrrvcs should be kept in the 
coolest part of the room or closet. Cofloo 
should not be bought in large qiiantitii's, 
because it soon loses its flavour ; unless, in- 
deed, it is roasted at home, which is a very 
economical plan for large f.imilies. It can 
bo boucjlit very chcai^ly uniuasted ; if pur- 
chased' by the twenty-eight pounds it can bo 
had at one shilling per pound ; and there 
is a ro.aster (iicculiar to Ireland) which i^ 
turned over the fire like a mop, that any one 
can use witli ease, to piepaie it whenever 
rcijuircd. . 

Loaf sugar shoukl be very white, close, 
heavy, and glittering ; it is economy to buy 
the best, as the muic refined the sugar is, 
the less the quantity required for swcettuir-j. 
Moist or brown sugar should have a 
crystalline, sparkling look, and should not 
be too powdery or sanillike. 

Talluw candles should be bought in l.aige 
quantities, if possible ; and purchased in 
tlie winter, as they keep best when made in 
cold weather. They should be kept sevoi.il 
months in a cool i)lace before they are used. 
Soap should be bought by the hundred- 
weight for cheapness, and kept long before 
it is used. It should be cut in pieces fit for 
use, and then put in a drawer to dry and 
harden slowly, without being exposed to the 
air ; for if it were to dry quickly it would be 
likely to break when used. Mottled soap is 
tiie most economical ; the best yellow soap 
melts much more rapidly in water. Soft 
soap for washing linen is a saving of half 
the quantity ; therefore it is economical, 
though dearer in price than liard soap. 
Soda, by softening the water, saves soap. 

Starch should be left in a warm, dry 
place. Sugar, sweetmeats, and salt, must 
all be kept very dry. ,,,,,» 

Rice, tapioca, sago, &c., should be kept 
close covered, or they will get insects in 
them ; it is better not to have large supplies 
of these articles. 

Buy lemons in June or July when they 
are freshly imported, and hang them in 
separate nets, for if they touch they will 

spoil. , , , , 

Onions, shallots, and garlic should be 
hung in ropes from a ceiling in an out-house 
[iiot in the store-room) ; and parsley, basil, 
sa^ knotted marjoram, and thyme should 
be . J and hung up ir= laper bags, each 
bag containing only one description of herb. 
They should be dried in the wind, and not 
in the sun. and when ordered in a receipt 
should be cautiously used, as a prepon- 
derance of one llavour in any seasoning 
spoils it.

them with a solution of two quarts of quick- 
lime, half a pound of saltpetre, and an 
ounce of cream of tartar ; but this is 
troublesome, and not so good as a more 
simple plan. 

Suet may bo kept for a twelvemonth, 
fluis : choose the firmest and most free Irom 
sidn or veins, remove all trace of these, put 



the suet in a saucepan at some distance from 
the fnc, and let it melt gradually ; when 
melted, pour it into a pan of cold spring 
water ; when hard, wipe it dry, fold it in 
white paper, put it into a linen bag, and 
keep it in a dry cool place ; when used it 
must be scraped ; it will make an e.vcellent 
pic-crust, cither with or without butter. 

'I'he trouble of housckcejiing is much 
diminished by having a fi.\ed day for giving 
out to the cook the tea, sugar, col'lee, 
plums, &e., which are likely to 'be required 
during the coming week ; weighing out the 
quantities in proportion to the number ol 
the family. Every week she should account 
for these quantities, bringing back whatever 
may chance to remain over and above her 
use. 

The spicc-box in the kitchen should be 
occasionally replenished from the store- 
room. . 

Keeping Accounts. 

So many good Housekeeper's books are 
now published that much need not be said I 
as to the mode of entry. But we think ' 
daily expenses are too minute in small 
families to be entered under all the various 
lieadings in most of the books with priiiteil 
lists. Tlie housewife is r.dvised to keep a 
tiny MS. Lo.jk and pencil in her pocket, 
and enter .7/ i/te mot/icz/i cveiy thing bhc buys 
or receives in the course of the day. 'Ih'is 
little record may be examined once a week, 
and its contents (so fiw as they relate to 
housekeeping) entered in the family account- 
book. 1 he cook should produce' her slate 
to check the lady's accounts, and the amount 
should be carelully added up. 

We prefer on rscl\ OS a plain-ruled .aceouut- 
book 'without printed items. '1 hen on one 
side, the lelt, we enter wiiatever money we 
receive during the week ; on the opposite 



pago the outlay we liavc made, w hich, when 
added up, can be subtracted at the bottom 
of the left page fiom the money received ; a 
weekly cheek is thus placed on the cxpenili'. 
lure, which is continually compared with 
the means of payment. 

it is well to have a fixed sum for house- 
keeping, which may not be exceeded. If 
any amount may be /,//, it is a good reserve 
fund for extra exjienses, or for ciiarity. 

Reatly x< -koners* will be found of great 
use both to s..v,j time, and also to help those 
who are slow at figures. One of them 
should always bo kept lying next to or on 
the housekeejicr's book.

Butcher's bills recjuire careful 
supervision, even when not paid till the 
quarter has elapsed, as errors in weight, 
even of ounces, or of price, as of farthings, f 
come to a considerable item jn the course 
of the year. The memoranda of weight 
should be also compared with the book. 
One morning every week \\\\\ suffice for 
these accounts, and, if fiuiliiully carried 
out. the practice will be attended with a 
constant improvement in economy and good 
housekeeping. 

Do not allow dripping or bones to become 
a perquisite of the cook. Dripping is most 
useful in a moderate family. It is an excel- 
lent medium for frying ; it will make good 
family pic-crust, and supply the place of 
suet in a dumpling. Bones are absolutely 
necessary for makmg gravies and stock for 
soup. 

Take care that butter is kept in a cool 
place and covered from the air. In summer 
get some saltpetre, dissolve it in cold water, 
and stand the butter crock in it, so that the 
saltpetre water may reach well up the sides. 
Cover it over with a wet cloth, the ends of 
which resting in the saltpetre water will 
keep it constantly moist. This is nearly as 
good as icing the butter. 

Milk should be kept in scrupulously clean 
vessels, and stale and fresh milk should 
never be mixed, or the good will be spoiled. 

Set apart from your income yearly a small 
sum to be invested in replacing worn house- 
hold linen. Buy occasionally a tablecloth, 
a pair of sheets, &c., &e. You will ieel 
these purchases much less than 
sui)ply a whole stock of linen at once. 

House linen should be looked over every 
six weeks or quarter, and carelully repaired. 
We like lavender-bags among the linen, to 
give it a fresh, agreeable smell ; but some 
persons assert that they bring moth. 

If you observe iron-moulds on the linen, 
speak at once to the laundress on the sub-

Ordering Dinner. 

When economy is to be considfrcd, or- 
loiing (liiiiier re(|iiiies some foresight and 
iii'^eiiuity in makiii'^ one day tell into the 
next. Many very small fini.lies will have 
a larije sirloin of beef on Siuulay, say, and 
go on eating it cold anc! badly hashed day 
after day till it is gone. Now this need not 
be. Let the housewife choose the very 
Banie joint with a good undercnt, ."nd we 
Ipvill see how many dilt'erent fivsh dinners 
f may be made froi.i it in our bill of fare for 
a week, 

ist. Let the cook turn back the fit and 
cut out the undercut, as it is called, leaving 
a little fat on it. and replacing the npj^cr fat 
.so as not to disfigure the joint. (Jut otf the 
Hap (which will enable you to carve the 
__oint more easily), and put it in pickle. 
'Now cut the under part \\\\.o fiUcts-dc-bxiif, 
dress them according to cur recipe, and you 
will have n delicious dish, No. I. 

The joint roasted, No. 2. 

Cold, and a few slices 01 the least dressed 
parts cut up for beef olives. No. 3. 

The flap-end nicely salted, boiled with a 
garnish of lanots, &e.. No. 4. 

But as we all object to dinners of " toit- 
•oiirs pcrdrix" we advise the housewife to 
alternate these dishes thus : — 

I-'irst dinner, Saiarduy — Fillets-de-bxicf, 
potatoes mashed in dish, also served fried 
in curled ribbons. 

Sunday.— Ro-^^t beef, Yorkshire pudding, 
boiled potatoes or Brussels sjirouts. 

Monday — Roast loin of mutton, potatoes. 

Tuesday — Cold beef and beef olives, po- 
tatoes, salad, stewed fruit or pudding. 

Wednesday — Hashed mutton, or curry, 
.vegetables. 

Tuursday— Rumpsteak, greens, potatoes. 

Friday — Soup, any remains of cold meat 
urricd, (or a little veal cutlet to make up), 
egetables, &c. 

Or if the inevitable leg of mutton be 
rdered (and it is unquestionably n good 
oint), it may be divided : the knuckle part 

oiled, the other end stewed with green 

eas ; but it does 7tot roa.st well cut in 
lalves, it is always spoilt as to flavour and 
uiciness. 

We are writing now for those who are 
ompelled to be economical. Therefore we 
nay observe that the bones of the sirloin 
kvith a small addition of meat should be put 
nto the stock-pot, and thus a nice soup 

ay be obtained according to our recipes. 



I And do not lot the hnu^rwife (hamprrrd bv

Ingenuity, care, and taste will do much 
to remedy the want of means. But if the 
wif.: h.is hot a fiist-rate cook. let her try to 
dress any es|u-eial dish heisdf. ("ullisated 
intellect will lu-lp her much nioie than shj 
woukl suppose in niastemg difliculties 
never '^veieomc b} an onlinaiy servant. It 
is .saiil that cooks, .ns well as i)oets, must ba 
to the manner born ; but we think the in^ 
spiratioa of affection may sui)ply the birth* 
right of talent, and the desire to add to 
home-happiness be strong enough to help 
the unste.adyand unpractised hand. '-Where 
there is a will there is a wav." 

If mear.s are abundant, there is no jortof 
excuse for an ill-kept table ; then the wife 
(still -sUi.iving the matter) m.iy fearlessly 
exert her taste .".nd vary the home fare with 
equal delicacy and address. She may hive 
her "fillcts-dcbxiir still, for they are -'a 
d.iinty dish to set before the queen," but 
she may retain the rolled flaj) on the joint, 
and eat boiled beef in its best form, the 
round or silver-side. She may vary me.it 
with poultry, add game to "her second 
couise, and should never be without good 
soup. Still there should be no waste ; 
economy should be practised for tite sake of 
the poor, who should be in every rich wife's 
thoughts. 

We will give a nice and economical bill 
of fare here for a week, for six or eight per- 
sons, for the wife who cai command a 
liberal sum for her table : — 

Summer. 

Sunday— Y\\\<vc\vic soup, a sirloin of beef, 
half a calf's head, greens, potatoes, and 
cauliflower ; puddin<r, either baked tapioca, 
gooseberry pudding, or ramekins. 

Monday— ^VnVW^ slice of salmon, coM 
beef, hashed calf's head, asparagus, pota- 
toes, salad ; puddin,q, aiiple or cold tapioca. 

Tuesday— '6:\\mQ\\ pudding, or boudin de 
saumon (from the remains of day before), 
leg of Iamb; green peas, potatoes ; pudding, 
boiled custards, or fruit tart (say currant 
and raspberry). 

Wednesday. — Green pea soup, boiled 
cliicken, cold lamb ; potatoes, salad ; pud-

KITCHEN UTENSILS. 



The younofand inexperienced housekeeper 
will, we believe, be glad of some gnidnnce 
in the selection of the utensils needed in her 
kitchen, so that she may not be at the nieicy 
of those who desire more than is really re- 
quired, or who are ignorant of the necessity 
i:nd use of many articles of the first import- 
ance in the art. With a view to helping our 
readers to decide in this matter for them- 
selves, we offer them here three lists of the 
articles absolutely essential in the kitchen. 
The first list is for a first-rate kitchen, the 
second for a medium one, the third for the 
cottage home. Of course any one of the 
three lists may be added to, as required ; 
but they will be a guide in the matter as 
thev now stand. 

^Todern science has greatly aided the cook 
in the implements of her art, and in order to 
be able to recommend the newest and best 
cooking utensils we have solicited and received 
the aid of some of the first manufacturing 
and furnishing ironmongers in London. 

The more expensive list will seldom be 
required by persons of moderate income, but 
they may select from it with profit some one 
or two articles, such as the Bain Marie pan. 
Saute pan, &c., which will add immensely 
to the cook's resources, and enable her to 
keep her dinner hot, or perform certain deli- 



cate culinnry performances much more cer- 
tainly than she could w thout them. 

We believe that the subject is worthy oft! i',- 
housekeeper's attention, as, though sonu- 
cooks are so ingenious and fertile in cxp. - 
dients that they will malve few utensils suffiec. 
still there are others who would wzll fullil 
the duties of their position if supplied witli 
all the mechanical aids tliey have a -ight to 
expect, but who fail utterly without them ; 
and it is surely unfair to expect a cook to 
prepare a good dinner without allowing her 
the needful implements. 

Some of the recent inventions, as Carson's 
Patent Salting Apjiaratus, Kent's Patent 
Soup Strainer, and the Patent Mincing Ma- 
chine, will be found to afford an immense 
saving of labour and time ; while the worst 
cook amongst "general servants" can 
scarcely achieve the feat of spoiling the joint, 
if it be cooked in Captain Warren's Every- 
body's Pot. 

W^e have not given an engraving of every 
separate article named in the lists ; some 
few are too well known to require illustration. 
All that are new or least known inordinary kit- 
chens have been presented to the eye pic- 
torially as well as verbally, and will, we hope, 
suffice for the full infonuation of the inex- 
perienced housekeeper.

is covered well with red-hot ashes or charcoal. 
Full directions for braising are given farther 
on. Tlie stewpan is a valuable utensil ; it 
will in case of need serve as a braisitig-pan, 
if tlie lid be made to go a little into the edge 
of the pan as some are made. 



Stock Pot. — Tlie slock pot receives in it 
bones, trimmings of meat, remains of cold 
game, &c., &e. , in short everything available 
for ordinary or good soup. It is to be wislied 
that every English artizan's wife jwssessed 
one ; it is the fotatt-fcu of tlie French work- 
man, who thus obtains nourishing soup and 
well-dressed meat at the same time.

Saucepan Digester. 



Digester, 



Slack's Patent " Digcstar" amnothoAoo 
warmly recommended to those who have 
need to practise economy. Tlie mode of 
using it is simple and easy. Care must be 
taken in filling a digester to leave room 
enotigh for the steam to pass off through the 
valve at the top of the cover. This may be 
done by filling the digester only three parts 
full of water and bruised bones or meat, 
which it is to be noticed are all to be put in 
together. It must then be placed near a 
slow fire, sc as only to simmer (more heat 
injures the quality), and this it must do for 
the space of eight or ten hours. After this 
has been done, the soup is to be strained 



Stewpan Digester. 

through a hair sieve or colander, in order to 
separate any bits of bones. The soup is 
then lobe put into the digester again, and 
afterwards whatever vegetables, spices, &c., 
are thought necessary are added, the whole 
is to be well boiled together for an hour or 
two, and it will be then fit for immediate 
use. In putting on the lid ot the digester, 
take care that a mark, thus (X) on the lid, 
is opposite to a similar one on the digester. 
The digester may also be obtained to contain 
from four quarts to ten gallons. The sauce- 
pan and stewpan digesters hold from one to 
eight quarts.

to be put in some tiriie after the joint. The 
meat, thus dressed, is taken out (in spite of 
an inferior cook) succulent, and scarcely at 
all reduced in weight ; as it wastes two 
ounces less in dressing than by the ordinary 
system of boiling. The flavour is much 
better than when the meat is boiled, as it

Gas cooking finds favour in many kitchens on account 
of tlie nrcat economy of fuel obtained by it. In small 
kitchens, in the htat of summer, the stove here repre- 
sL-ntecl will (in cases of early dinner) allow the cook or 
L'cneral servant to let her fnc go out and enjoy a cool 
apartment. Tlie stove should be placed, if possible, m 
the back kitchen or scullery.

Directions. — When coal is used, the front 
and bottom gratings will be required. 

When wood is used tiiese may be removed. 

To improve the Draught, if necessary. — 
Carry the flue-pipe a few feet up the chim- 
ney, or enclose tiie fireplace witii an iron 
plate, in which cut out a round hole for tiie 
pipe to pass through. 

To iisctlic Stove in the open air, it will be 
necessary to have about ten feet of perpen- 
dicular pipe, to ensure a proper draugiit. 

Economy in the use of fuel is not to be 



neglected by the housekeeper. Cinders 
should be carefully sifted. The grate (if the 
ordinary one alone be possessed) should be 
screwed in as soon as the fire for cooking is 
no longer required. The fire at tlie hack of 
the open range may then be made of small 
coals, wetted and left to cake. Cinders may 
be used for ironing stoves, and for heating 
ovens, 

Tlie Cottager's Stove will be found an 
economical assistant to the common opca 
range in small kitchen>. 



Soyer's Patent Culinary Utensils. 



It would be unjust to the memory of a 
great cook if we omitted from our list the 
culinary utensils invented by the late M. 
Sever, to whom our gratitude as a nation is 



due. They consist of the B.iking Stew- 
ing Pan, the Improved Baking Dish, the 
X'egetable Drain:r, and the Portfolio Meat 
Screen. 




't 1 



I 



BaJdn'f Stewing Pan, — By this pan all 
tlie nutriment and flavour of the various in- 
gredients are preserved. It has great ad- 
vantages over the old method of boiling or 
stewing — namely, tliat it gives hardly any 
trouble ; and, in addition to its retaining all 
the nutriment, it cooks in one-third less time 
than by the ordinary mode. 

hnprovcd Baking Disk. — The late M. 
Soyer thus described this invention in the 
"Shilling Cookery for the People"; "I 
h.-ivf^ :itt;ic;hftf! a mov.^ablc fahc grating of 
wire, to the middle of which is fixed a trivet, 
three inches la height. I put the pudding 



j at the bottom of the dish, then put in the 
! grating, on which I place the potatoes ; then 
i on the trivet I put the meat. By this means 
I the surplus fat, which would otherwise fall 
; in the pudding and prevent its setting, de- 
scends on the potatoes, making them deli- 
cate and crisp. This is applicable to any 
joint, and the meat being more elevated than 
usual when placed in the oven, causes it to 
partake more of the flavour of a roast joint 
than it does when put immediately over the 
pudding or potatoes; the vapour arising from 
which soddens the meat, instead of leaving 
it brown and well carbonized.

joint thoroughly, and yet retaining its juices 
in it. 

The cook should prepare her fire some 
little time before she puts the meat down. 
The grate should be let out sufTiciently wide 
to take in the whole size of the joint, with a 
margin to spare on each side, and the fire 
should be so good as not to require making 
up during tlie time the joint is roasting. It 
should be sufficiently large to be of an equal 
strength all the time the meat is dressing, 
aided by a large coal put on the top of U 
occasionally. A great deal of the success in 
roasting will depend on the heat and good- 
ness of the fire. , 

Begin roasting by placing the meat at 
some distance from the fire (about twelve 
inches), and baste it from the first. When 
it is half done, move it gradually nearer to 
the fire for it to be well browned. If the 
meat were to be put close to the fire at first, 
it would dry up, and the outside would be 
dressed before the heat had penetrated the 
mass ; the juices being thus shut in, the joint 
would be under-dressed. Some persons pre- 
fer meat roasted very slowly. That method 
is expensive, because it requires a large fire 
to be kept up for a length of time ; and also, 
unless done by a cook who understands her 
business well, and who makes a fire fit for it, 
the meat is apt to get sodden. We need 
scarcely say that the meat screen should be 
placed behind it from the first of its being 
put down. 

Cover the fat of veal or lamb with a piece 
of paper tied on with twine. 

Baste the meat very frequently, for the 
more it is basted the better it will eat. When 
it is nearly done, the paper over the fiit may 
be removed, and the joint lightly dredged 
with flour, in order to give it a savoury brown 
appearance called frothing. Sprinkle a vay 
little salt on it also, but not till it is just 
ready to dish up, as salt draws out the 
gravy. 

The usual time allowed for roasting is a 
quarter of an hour or twenty minutes for 
each pound of meat. But this rule does not 
always answer. Meat fresh killed takes 
longer to roast than when it has been kept 
long ; and in warm weather it takes less time 
than in cold. Brown meats require less time 
than white meats do. In frosty weather it 
is better to kiy the joint before the fire to 
thaw before it is put on thespit, as, if frozen, 
it will be impossible to calculate the time 
required for dressing it, and in fact it will

always be careful that the spit, and also the 
hook used in the bottle-jack, be wiped before 
they are used. She should also be careful 
how she hangs the meat, so as to avoid dis- 



figuring it by nmning the spit through the 
prime parts. 

Cradle spits are much the best for large 
kitchens ; for small families, the bottle-jack 
in a tinned screen does very well, or, better 
still, the improved spring-jack and roaster. 

Let the butcher chop the joints of necks 
and loins of mutton and lamb before they 
are dressed, or they cannot be well sepa- 
rated by the carver when they are sent to 
table. 

When the roast meat has been taken up, 
the fat which has dripped from it into the 
pan should be poured into a basin, previ- 
ously dipped in cold water. It must be left 
till the next day, when beneath the fat at the 
top will be found a fine meat jelly fit for 
gravies, &c. The cake of dripping should 
be melted and strained into cold water, from 
which it can be removed in cakes for future 
use. 

Veal, pork, and lamb should be tho- 
roughly done, not retaining any red gravy ; 
at the same time, care should be taken not 
to dry them up, or roast them till the flesh 
parts from the bones. 

Mutton does not take quite the length of 
time to roast that beef does. 

A very economical way of making gravy 
is to skim the fat from the dripping in the 
pan under the meat, and pour two or three 
spoonfuls of hot water into it ; stir it, and 
po'.u- it over the meat through a sieve. 

How to Boil. 

Joints to be boiled should be washed ex- 
tremely clean and skewered into good shape, 
then they should be put in the saucepan and 
covered well with co/of water. They must be 
set over a moderate fire and let boil slowly. 
Just before the water reaches boiling point 
the scum will rise to the top, and must be 
carefully skimmed off; if not done at the 
moment of ebullition it will fall back on the 
joint boiling and disfigure it. The pot will 
require skimming every time the scum rises. 
The saucepan must be kept covered all the 
time, however, the lid being only removed 
for the cook to skim the pot. 

Gentle simmering, not fast boiling, is most 
desirable for meat, as by quick boiling the 
outside is hardened before the joint is done, 
and the meat becomes hard and tough, 
fruni the chemical reasons already given. 

Salted meat requires longer boiling than 
fresh meat ; when smoked and dried it takes 
longer still. Pickled or salted meat should 
be soaked before boiling in cold water, for a 
longer or shorter time as its saltness and size 
may require. Take care that the joint, if 
large, does not adhere to the bottom of the 
pot. To prevent this possibility cooks sorac*

be needed. For people who cannot aftord

How to Broil.

micl care, niceness, and skill, arc required

should spring up during the time he steak. 
&c is broiling, the gridiron must be caught 
off 'the file and held^n one side till the blaze 
?s gone ; a little salt thrown on the fire wil 
like it clear again. Fish should be wrapped 
napieS weU-buttered letter-paper be^ 

they ire placed on the gridiron, to keep 
tei^ from smoke, and prevent their beam- 
ing too dry; the gridiron may be nibbed 
with a little chalk first. Cutlets which aie 
covered with egg and bread-crumbs must 
be doped in a little clarified butter before 
to Kut on the gridiron. The best way 
however, is to season the cutlet with pepper, 
and brush it over with a uulc uvUtv. ••-•^^

u ned often in order that they may be done 
in every part, but the fork used for this pui-

must be put into the outer skin or fat.

it is done. 



How to Stew. 

Stewing is a wholesome, excellent, and 
economical mode of cooking. Very hale 
fuel is used for it. and meat so prepared 
is both digestible and delicious. V,\Mboilnig 
is not stewing, and we warn our readers that 
all we have said in praise of it may be re- 
versed if they let the stew-pan do more 
than simmer very gently. ,Stewmg is best 
done over a regular stove ; but when a cook 
can command only an old-foshioned kitchen 
range she must place her stew- pan on a trivet 
high above the fire, and constantly watch it 
and move it nearer to. or further from the 
fire. Stewing must of ".ourse always be done 
over a slow fire, and the stew-pan id should 
shut quite closely. It should be kept at a 
frentle simmer, without letting it boil, and it 
must stew for several hours, according to 
the weight of the meat, which is not con- 
.idered done until it is quite tf.nder. Some- 
times the cook stews the meat in a jar, p aced 
in a stew-pan full of water, and thusextrac s 
the pure gravy unmixed with water. We 
have also a recipe for stewmg meat and 
vegetables together, without water being put 
in the iar with them, thus making an excel; 
lent smip from the union oi U.e P'epes wi 
the meat and the water contained in the 
vegetables.

How to Fry.— Gladng-— Boning;. 



lA 



■: ■;( 



How to Fry. 
Cooks should always have two fryins-prms, 
and a third, not much bigger than a large 
plate, for omelets, fritters, &c.. if (hey have 
no saut6-pan. The pan mnst be kept deli- 
cately clean and nice ; the butter, dripping, 
lard, or oil in which the fish, meat, &c. , is fried 
must always be boilings; hoi before the meat is 
put into the pan. 'Ihe rule is that a sufh- 
cient quantity of fat must be heated thus in 
the pan to cover the steak, chop, or what- 
ever is to be fried— frying being actually 
boiling in fat instead of water. Mutton 
rhons"do not require any fat in the pan with 
tl-'em : they have enough in themselves, but 
they must be -^ften turned and moved about 
to prevent them from burning. Of course 
we speak oulv of chops cooked quite plain, 
^«., without bd )g egged and bread-crumbed. 
Cut and sl:in the chop nicely, and season it 
with a little pepper before putting it in the 

I'lmb cullets, and lamb chops, must be 
egged and bi'-ad-crumbed twice, in order 
to look well. 

Steaks ^h.oukl be cut diree quarters of an 
inch ♦hick for f.ying. and should be pep- 
pered, but not have salt put on them before 
they arc dressed, as it makes them hard. 
When done, a little salt is sprinkled lightly 
over them. 

Cutlets, f> la maintcnon, and mullet are 
fiied in buttered paper covers. 

The first process in frying is to put enough 
drippin? or butter in your pan, to cover the 
chop or steak when the butter is melted. 
Thei' the fat must be made to bod in the 
pan, and when at its greatest heat the sub- 
stance to be fried must be plunged into it. 
The pan must then be lifted from the fire 
for a minute or two, to prevent the outside 
from getting black before the inside is 

dressed. , , ,. , . 

Fish must be well dried before frying, 
in a cloth well sprinkled with flour ; or first 
they may be wiped well, thoroughly dried 
and dredged with flour. Then an ^z?, is 
well brushed over them, and finely-grated 
bread, or biscuit, is sprinkled over them. 
The fat should be quite at boiling-point 
(when it will no longer hiss or bubble) be- 
fore the fish is put in, and it should be well 
covered by the liquid butter, or oil, the 
latter is much the best for frying fish 
in, but of course it is expensive. Hog's 
lard and dripping are also used in economi- 
cal kitchens. The frying-pan should never 
be left for a moi'^cnt till the fish, is done. 

In kitchens where strict economy is de- 
manded, it is usual when liver and bacon 
are to dressed to fry the bacon first, whicli 
\vX\ leave enouijh fat in the pan for the 



liver to be put in without either butter or 
dripping, but this mode, though economi- 
cal, is very coarse, and we do not recom- 
mend it. The liver will be more delicate if 
it be fried before the bacon. 

To Glaze. 
Glazing is done by boiling down good 
rich beef stock till it is ictluccd to the con- 
sistence of a thin, bright brown paste. Of 
course, all liit and sediment must first be 
removed from the stock before it is boiled 
down for glaze. It should be done over a 
quick fire, boiled fast till well reduced, then 
clianged into a smaller stew-pan, and 
should continue boiling till it is made. It 
must be kept in a jar w^ell covered, and 
when reciuired for use should be put into a 
stew-pan and let stand in boiling water till 
the jelly is melted. It must be brushed over 
the tongue, chicken, or beef with a glazing 
brush once or twice till the operation is 
finished. 

Boning, Larding, and Braising. 
The three most difficult operations to 
achieve well in cookery are boning, larding, 
and braising. Coning is so little under- ' 
stood by inferior cooks that it is best, if 
your servant is not firsl-ratc, to have it done 
by the poulterer with whom you deal. 
Nevertheless, it is an art which tends so 
much to economy, that it would quite repay 
the mistress of a family to pay for a few 
lessons for her domestic from a good poul- 
terer or cook. The bones of poultry and 
hares are most useful for making gravies, 
and hares are more easily carved, and look 
better when boned. Any butcher will bone 
joints when required. Although we cannot 
hope that our readers w ill be able to achieve 
the boning of a fowl, &e., from any verbal 
discription, we, nevertheless, give a few di- 
rections on the subject, from an excellent 
recipe of Miss Acton's for the performance 
of the operation. Turkeys, fowls, hares, 
&c., are boned, as well as joints. 

To bone a Tiukey or Fowl.— Miss Acton's. 
" Cut through the skin down the ^ntre 
of the back, and raise the flesh carefully on 
either side with the point of a sharp knife 
until the sockets of the wings and thighs 
are reached. Till a little practice has been 
gained, it will, perhaps, be better to bone 
these joints before proceeding further ; but 
after they are once detached from it, the 
whole of the body may easily be separated 
from the flesh, anil taken out entire. Only 
the ncckbones and merrythought will then 
remain to bo removed. Ihe bird thus pre-

The art of sautc-injj well consists in do- 
in.q: it quickly, to keep the gravy and succu- 
lence in the meat. It is an economical 
mode of dressing small things of every 
kind of food. It is, you see, very different 
from frying, which is really boiling in hot 
fat, and requires a far greater quantity of 
the butter, oil, &c., for its performance. 

Steaming. 

St ;aming is an admirable mode of dress- 
ing bacon and hams. It preserves the fla- 
vour in them, and quite saves waste. Any 
one who has once eaten steamed bacon will 
never again, we think, order it to be boiled, 
,so tondiT and succulent will it be found. 

In "Kitchen Utensils," page 21, will be 
found the engraving and description of a 
new steam saucepan, which pron. ocs to be 
a great addition to the kitchen. 

In it the meat or fowl is cooked without 
being touched by either water or steam. It 
appears to us to be a cheap and easy mode 



of braising in a new form. It is styled 
' ' Everybody's Cooki ng Pot .' ' The novel ty 
of the process consists in cooking without 
the viands coming into actual contact with 
water or steam ; the meat, kept from water 
entirely, is cooked in an inner cylinder, the 
outer one containing the water being kept 
at boiling-point. The food thus prepared 
is cooked in its own vapour, and none of 
its nutritious properties wasted. The well 
known fact, that meat cooked by the ordi- 
nary methods of roasting or boiling, loses 
a large portion both in bulk and weight, as 
well as some very important chemical qua- 
lities, is of itself sufficient to stamp with 
the seal of approbation any invention that 
avoids these evils. We have proved, by 
personally trying it, that meat, fish, !nd 
poultry, when cocked in this pot, retain 
those noiuishing juices which, if cooked 
in the ordinary method, would have been 
thrown off in vapour, but by this mode 
become condensed and arc returned in mois- 
ture at a temperature sufficient to cook in 
the most perfect manner. To the poor as 
well as the rich, this invention will theie- 
fore prove a great boon.

CARVING. 



One of the most importntit acquisitions 
in the routine of daily life is the ability to 
carve, not only well, but elegantly. It is 
true th.-'t the present fashion of fiussian 
dinners i ; fast banishing the necessity for 
promiscuous carving from the richly-served 
boards of the wealthy ; but in the circles of 
middle life, where it is not adopted, the ne- 
cessity of skill in the use of a carving-knife 
is sufficiently obvious. 

Ladies ought especially to make carving 
a study ; at their own houses, and at the 
family dinner, they should Ije enabled to 
perform the task allotted to them with suffi- 
cient skill to prevent remark, or the calling 



forth of engcf proffers of assistance from 
good-natured visitors near, who probably 
would far rather not be so employed. 

Carving presents no real difficulties; it 
simply requires knowledge. All displays of 
exertion or violence are in very bad taste ; 
for if they are not an evidence of the want 
of ability on the part of the carver, they 
present a very strong testimony of the 
touLThness of a ioint, or the more than full 
age of a bird : in both cases they should be 
avoided. A good knife of moderate size, 
sufficient length of handle, and great sharp- 
ness is requisite; the carving-knife for a lady 
should be light, and smaller than that used

by gentlemen. Fowls are very easily 
carved ; and of joints, such as loins, 
breasts, fore-quarters, iSre., the butcher 
should have strict injunctions to separate 
the joints. 

The dish upon which the article to be 
carved is placed should be conveniently 
near to the carver, so th,il he may have full 
control over it; for if it is placed far off, 
nothing cm i)revent an ungraci-hilne-.s of 
a[5i)earance, and a dilticulty in performing; 
that which if it were in its proper place 
could be achieved with ease. 

In helpin;; fish, nicety and care must be 
exercised ; lightness of hand and dexterity 
of management are necessary, and can only 
be acc|uircd by practice. The flakes which, 
in fish like salmon and cod, are large, 
should not be broken in helping, for the 




Aitch-Bone. 




Sirloin of Beef. 




FUlet of Veal. 



beauty of the fish is then destroyed, and it 
becomes less inviting to the appet te. 

In the following directions, accompanied 
by dia>;rams, we have; endeavoured to be as 
exjjlicit as possible ; but practice alone will 
enable any person to carve with skill and 
facility. 

Riiis oi" Bi:i;i'.— Then; are two modes of 
carving this joint ; the first, which is now 
becoming common, and is easy to an ama- 
teur carver, is to cut across the bone, com- 
nieneing in th ; centre, an;l helping fat from 
A, ;us marked in the i'ngra\'iug of the sirloin, 
or it should be carved in slices from A to B, 
commencing either in the centre of the joint 
or at the sides. Occasionally the bones are 
removed, and the meat formed into a fillet ; 
it should then be carved as a round of 
beef. 

An AiTcii-BoNio of BtCF'.F.— This is a 
simple joint to carve, but the slices from it 
must be cut quite even, and of a very mode- 
rate thickness. When the joint is boiled, 
before cutting it, remove a slice from the 
whole of the upper part, of sufficient thick- 
ness (say a quarter of an inch) to arrive at 
the juicy part of the meat at once. Carve 
from A to B ; let the slices be moderately 
thin — not too thin— help fat with the lean in 
one piece, and give a little additional fat 
which you will find below C ; the solid fat 
is at A, and must be cut in slices hori- 
zontally. The round of beef is carved in 
the same manner. 

Tiiii Sirloin of Bkef. -— Tlic 
under ])art should be first carved, as 
indicated in the engraving across the 
bone. In carving the uj^per jiait the 
same directions sliould be followed as 
for the ribs, carving either side, or in 
the centre, from A to B, and helping 
the fat from D. 

Fillet of Veal.— Cut a slice off 

the whole of the upper part in the 

same way as from a round of beef, 

this being, if well roasted, of a nice 

brown, should be helped in small 

pieces with the slices you ciit for each 

jjcrson. 'J'hc stuffuig is skewered iu 

the flap, and where the bone comes out there is 

some placed ; help this with the meat, with a 

piece of the fat. 

Neck of Veal.— Were you to attempt to 
carve each chop, anu serve it, you would not 
only place a gigantic piece upon the plate of the 
person you intended to help, but you would 
waste much time, and should the vertcbrie 
not have been joitited by the butcher, you 
would find yourself in the position of the un- 
graceful carver, being compelled to exercise a 
degree of strength which should never be suf- 
fered to appear ; very possibly, too, splashing 
gravy in a manner not contemplated by the 



3yc(l, and it

and help in slices of moderate thick- /,, 
ness ; you can cut from c to u in order U^'^, 
to separate the small bone?., divide and ^

they are liked. 

Loin ov Vkai.. — This joint is sent 
to table served as a sirloin of beef. 
Having turned it over, cut out the 
kidney and the f;\t, return it to its 
jjroper ])osition, and carve it, as in th(> 
neck of veal, from H to A ; help 
with it a slice of kidney and fat. 
The kidney is usually placed upon a 
dry toast when removed from the 
joint, -■ 

SiioULDF.R OF Veal is sent to \ 
table with the underpart placed up- 
permost. Help it as a shoulder of 
mutton, beginning at the knuckle 
end. 

The Bricast of Veal.— Sepa- 
rate the ribs froin the brisket, cutting 
from A to B ; these small bones are 
the sweetest, and are mostly preferred ; 
you will cut them as at D D u, and serve. 
The long ribs are divided as at C c c ; 
and havmg ascertained the preference of 
the person, Lelp accordingly ; at good 
tables the scrag is not served, but is 
found, when properly cooked, a very 
good stew. 

Calf s Head.— There is much more 
meat to be obtained from a calf's head 
by carving it one way than another. 
Carve from A to P, cutting quite down 
to the bone. At the fleshy part of the 
neck end you will find the throat sweet- 
bread, of which you can help a slice with 
the other part ; you will remove the eye 
with the point of the knife and divide it in 
halves, helping those to it who profess a 
preference for it ; there are some gela- 
tinous pieces around it which are palatable. 
Remove the jawbone, and then you will 
meet with some fine-flavoured lean ; the

palate, which is under the head, is by Fome 
thought a dainty, and should be proffered 
when carving. 

A Shoulder of Mutton.— This is a 
joint upon which a great diversity of opinion 
exists, many professing a species of horror 
at its insipidity ; others finding much deli- 
cacy of flavour in certain i^arts. In good 
uuuton there is no doubt but that, if pro-

consulted. It is a very insipid joint when 
cold, and should therefore be liashcd if sent

Lf.g oi- Mutton. —The under or 
thickest part of the leg should be ])laced

rately thin, from i! to c. Many persons 
liave a taste for tliekmickle, and this ques- 
tion should be asked, and, if prefeired, it 
should be .sent to the guest. When cold, 
the b.ick of the leg should be ]ilaced up- 
permost, and thus carved. If the cramp 
bone is retjuested, (some persons regard 
it as a dniiity) in.sert your knife at D, i)ass- 
and you will remove it. 
Saddi.h ok Mutton. — The 
t;iil end is divided in the engraving, 
and the kidneys skewered tmder

titste, and is not always done. 
Carve from A to u in thin slices,

w ho desire it. 

TnK Loin of Mutton, if .small, 
sjiould be carved in cho]xs, begin- 
ning with the outer chop ; if large, 
carve slices the whole length. A neat way is to run the knife along the chine bone, and under 
the meat along the ribs ; it may then be cut in slices as shown in the engraving of the 
saddle of mutton. By this process fat and lean are served together ; your knife 
should be veiy sharp, anrl it should be done cleverly.

Haunch of Vf.nison.— Have 
the disli placed before you so that 
the loin is nearest to you, and the 
knuckle farthest ; then cut from A 
to II, suRiciently near the knuckle 
to prevent the escape of any gravy ; 
then make your first cut from \ to 
C-, with a slant'Mg cut, and then let 
e.ioh succeeding slice be sloping, so 
that all the gravy iv.ay be. relained 
in the hollow thus foriued ; the fat 
will be found at the left side, and 
must be served with the meat. 

Kit), if kept until the age at which lambs 
are killed, is served and carved in the same 
manner ; if killed at a month or fiv-. \'eeks, 
it is roasted whole, and carved in the v •■ .chen. 

Y>o\KK. — The leg when sent to table .should 
be placed with the back uppermost and the 

Ham is served as placed in the engraving, 
and should come to table ornamented. Carve 
from A to H, cutting thin slices slantingly, to 
give a wedge-like appearance, i'h.ose who 
prefer the hock carve at n, in th.e same 
direction as from A to n, then carve from 
I) t'^ c, ui thin slices, as indicated in the 
diagiam. 

Boili:d Tongue. — Carve across the 
tongue, but do not cut through ; keep the 
slices rather thin, and help the fat and kernels 
from underneath. 

Roast Pig. — The cook should send a 
roast pig to table as displayed here, garnished 
with head and ears ; carve the joints in tin; 
direction shown by the lines in the diagram, 
then divide the ribs ; serve with plenty of sauce. 
Should one of the joints be too much, it may 
be separated. Bread sauce and stuffing should 
accompany it. An ear and the jaw are favourite 
parts with many people. 

Hare. — Cut slices from n to A of moderate 
thickness. When the hare is young you can, 
after removing the shoulders and legs, cut 
across the back, and divide it into 
several pieces. This is not practicable 
with a full grown hare, unless it is 
boned. The shoulders and legs are 
easily removed by placing the knife 
between them, and turning them 
back ; the joint will disclose itself, 
and can then be separated. The 
head should not be removed until the 
last ; divide it from the neck, remove 
the lower jaw, then cut through the 
division which ajipears from the nose to the 
top of the skull, and lay it open. The stuft- 
ing should be given with whatever portion 
may be helped. 

Roast Rabbits are carved in the same 
manner,

this may be done with ease. The meat should

pieces scored by the butcher.

most complete mode of dissectintj, .so .is to 

obtain the largest (luantity of meat. In no 

cast, is this ability more demanded than in 

carving a roast turkey. Unless this is done 

well, fliere is not only much waste, but the appearance 

of the turkey is spoiled. You will commence by carvuij; 

slices froiri each side of the breast, in the .same direction 

as the lines marked in the eni;ravmg, cutting from A 

to B, Then reinove the U'gs, fiividing the thighs from 

the drumsticks, and here an instrnment termed a dis- 

jointer will be found serviceable, for luiless tiie turkey 

be very young, and the union (;f the joints very accurately 

taken, carving becomes difticult. The disjointer effects 

the separation at once, and it possesses also the .advan- 

, tage of enabling the carver to divide a thigh into two, 

thus permittmg a less bulky portion to be served. The iiinions and that iwrtion of 

the body removed with it an; ulwavs a delicacy, and care shoidd be taken to carve tliem 

nicely. 'I he joint of the pinion will be found at H. The stuffing, if it be of truffles, you 

vail obtaui by makmgjm opening at c. Ordinary forcemeat is found m helping the breast. 

BoiLKD TUKKKY is trussed in .i different fashion to 
the ro.ast, but the direction given for carving the former 
applies to the latter. The legs in the boiled tui ,<ey 
being drawn into the body may cause some little diffi- 
culty at first in their separation, but a little praciice will 
soon surmount it. 

Roast Fowl.— This operation is a nice \nd skilful 
one to perform ; it requires both obset ation and 
pr.iotice. Insert the knife bet\,een the legs and the 
side, press back the leg with the blade of the knife, 
and the joint will come apart if judiciously managed, 
it will require bur a ni(k whert; the joints unite. Re- 
move the wing from D to b, cut through and lay it back 
as witii the leg. separating the joint with the edge of the 
knife, remove the merrythought and neck bones ne.xt ; 
^ this you will accomplish by inserting the knife and 
acQ forcing it under the bones ; raise it and it will readily 
— .separate from the breast. You will divide the breast 
from the body by cutting throu;/'. liie small ribs down 
to the vent, turn the back uppermo.st, now put the knife 
into about the centre between the neck and rump, raise

PHEASANT.— Clear the leg by inserting the edge of the km e 
between it and the body, then take off the wings, h to A, but ilo 
not remove much of the breast with them, you are thus enabled to 
obtain some nice slices ; the pheasant is then carved as a towl.

PAUTUrDGK.— Separate the legs, and tlu'ii divide the bird into 
three parts, leaving each leg and wing together. The breast is 
then divided from the back, and helped whole, the latter being 
helped with any of the other parts. When the party consists of 
gentlemen onlv, the bird is divided m halves 
by cutting lengthwise right through from the 
centre.

To Eoast Coffee. 

1. Have either a Patent Roaster, or the 
Irish mop roaster. To every three pounds 
of coffee you put in the roaster add a piece 
of good fresh butter, a little larger than a 
marble, and two tea-spoonfuls of jiowdered 
sugar ; then roast the berries. This little 
addition develops the aroma of the berry. 
Many people prefer having chicorv added 
to then- coffee— tlie proportion is about a 
quarter of a pound of chicory to a iDound of 
coffee. 

Excellent Coffee for Three Breakfast Cups. 

2. Four tablespoonfuls of roasted coffee 
berries ; three teacupfuls of boiling water. 

Take four tablespoonfuls of roasted coffee 
berries and put them in the oven till well 
warmed through ; then grind them. Put 
the coffee ia the pot, which should have a 



I piece of tin over the middle strainer to pre- 
vent the coffee from filling up the holes ; pour 
i in three teacupfuls of boiling water. The 
j breakfast-cup should be filled up with boil- 
ing milk. 

Soyer's Mode. 

3. Soyer's mode of making coffee was to 
warm the powder over the fire first, then to 
pour the boiling water over it ; cover it 
closely for five minutes, strain it and boil it 
w^ again for use. This is a good wav, but 
the easier plan is to make it in the pe'rcola- 
tor ; first warming the powder in a covered 
cup before it is put into the coffee-pot to be 
made. 

French coffee is made by adding a pint of 
made coffee to a pint of boiling milk, and 
warming both togetljer, but not letting them 
boil too long, ^^

the right. When it is made, turn it into a 
soup-plate, adding a little salt or a little 
sugan according to taste. Send it to table 
with a jug of hot milk, which should be 
added to it by degrees for eating. 



To Toast Muffins. 
9. Pull open the sides of the mufTm exactly 
in the centre, about half an inch in ; put the 
toasting-fork in it and toast it carefully. 
When^t is done, and it sliould only be 
liohtly toasted, pull it apart, lay a little 
butter on each side, and close the muffin. 
Put it on a hot plate and cut it in four. If 
more than one are rociuired, lay them on 
the first done, but do not send in a great 
pile of muffins, as they are better served hot. 
A hot-water plate with a cover,— -a regular 
muffin plate,— should be used, and two at 
the most only be sent in at a time. 

Crumpets. 
10. Do not open crumpets ; toa<;t them 
carefully and very quickly ; butter tiiem on 
both sides, and serve them separately on a 
hot-water plate, if you have one ; if not, 
send them in hot and hot, as they are not 
nice lukewarm. Never put one crumpet on 
the top of the other, as the under one would 
become heavy. 

Bread. 
Everybody is, I believe, of opinion that 
home-made bread is cheaper, sweeter, and 
more wholesome than that bought at the 
baker's, unless it is badly made. Heavy, 
close, bitter bread is only too well known in 
many households where it is home-made ; 
this is not economical, as it cannot nourish 
the eaters as good bread docs, and it is, 
generally speaking, wasted. Let us see if 
it is not possible to teach how to make bread 
of all kinds, which shall be good, light, 
sweet, and appetizing. The oven plays an 
important part in this manufacture. 

A brick oven heated with wood is the 
right one for economy. It is possible to 
bake bread in the iron oven attached to a 
range, but the author, from personal experi- 
ence, can assure her readers that home- 
made bread thus baked is more expensive 
than bakers', on account of the quantity of 
fuel it takes to heat the oven for bread- 
baking, and the necessity of making it up in 
small loaves, which are not economical. 

The brick oven is heated by fixggot wood ; 
after it is cleared out. the door sliould be 
shut very closely for half an hour before you 
put in your loaves. The oven will then be 
thoroughly heated, and the heat will last for 
some time. 

A brick oven for baking bread should be 
as hot as you can bear to hold your hand in 
(without touching the bricks of course) whilst 
counting twenty ; this is an established rule 
in most farmhouses. 

Bread is longer baking in an iron oven 
than in a brick one. Ne.\t to the oven in

Recipes for Yeast and Bread. 



importance comes the ye.ist. We have used, 
and like, both German and patent yeast, 
but as many persons prefer tlieir own, and 
it is always well for the house to be inde- 
pendent of external he ps in this matter, we 
give receipts for making yeast, for the good- 
ness of which we can answer. 

Flour should be purchased of a miller; 
it will be less likely to be adulterated than 
if it passed through a second hand. The 
best flour is generally used in gentlemen's 
kitchens ; nevertheless, we know several 
county families (and one nobleman's family) 
famous for excellent household bread, in 
wiiich the " best seconds " are always used. 
There is no doubt that more nutrition is 
contained in brown bread than in white, and 
that the whiter the bread the less is tiie 
nourishment derived from it. Brown bread 
is excellent for weak digestions, and for 
many otiier reasons should be eaten alter- 
nately with white bread in all families ; 
moreover, it is less adulterated than the 
very white bread when purchased from the 
bakers. 

The flour of "hard wheat," as it is called, 
is the most nutritious ; it is not so white as 
that procured from soft wheat, but has more 
gluten in it. 

Flour when kept in store should be placed 
in a warm dry room, as, if at all damp, it 
will make the biead or cakes for which it is 
used heavy. It is safest to put the quantity 
of flour you are about to make into bread 
before the fire in a large dish or pan for an 
hour or two, in order to have it warm and 
dry for use. 

Great cleanliness is required for making 
bread — a clean trough or brown earthen- 
ware pan ; very clean hands and arms, and 
nice fresh yeast. The fresher the yeast, the 
less j'ou will require of it. 

Never leave the dough half made, nor 
allow it to get cold beiore it is finished ; if 
you do, it will be heavy. Too small a 
proportion of yeast will make the dough 
heavy. 

If the sponge or the dough be permitted 
to overwork itself it will become sour in 
warm weather. Do not put it too near the 
fire, but keep it warm at a gentle and equal 
degree of heat. 

Bread baked in tins will be lighter than 
when made into ordinary loaves, and is best 
for toast or sandwiches. 

Too little water will spoil the bread ; too 
much will make it too slack. If by accident 
the latter fault is perceptible, make the 
bread up in tins, and it will not nvucli 
matter. 
The proportions given in the numerous 



course be modified according to the quan- 
tity of bread required. 

How to make your own Yeast. 

Time to boil, half an hour ; to make, four 

days, 

ir. Two ounces of the best hops ; four 
quarts of water ; one pound of flour ; three 
pounds of good potatoes. 

Monday morning boil two ounces of the 
best hops in four quarts of water for half an 
hour ; strain it, and let the liquor cool down 
to new milk warmth ; then put in a small 
handful of salt and half a pound of brown 
sugar ; beat up one pound of the best 
flour with some of the liquor, and then mix 
all well together. On Wednesday add 
three pounds of potatoes, boiled and then 
niashed. to stand till Thursday ; then strain 
it, and put it into seltzer-water bottles, and 
it is ready for use. 

N.B.— It must be stirred frequently while 
it is making, and kept near the fire. 'Before 
using, shake the bottle well up. It will 
keep in a cool place for two months, and is 
best at the latter part of the time. The 
beauty of this yeast Is, that it ferments 
spontaneously, not requiring the aid of 
other yeast ; and. if care be taken, it will 
ferment well in the earthen bowl in which it 
is made. 

To make Bread. 

Time, one hour to bake loaves of two 

pounds weight each. 

12. Seven pounds of flour ; two quarts of 
warm « ater ; a large tablespoonful of salt ; 
half a gill of yeast. 

Put the flour into a deep pan, heap it 
round the sides, leaving a hollow in the 
centre ; put into it a quart of warm water, a 
large spoonful of salt, and half a gill of 
yeast ; have ready three pints more of warm 
water, and with as much of it as may be 
necessaiy, make the whole into a rather soft 
dough, kneading it well with both hands. 
When it is smooth and shining, strew a 
little flour on it ; lay a thickly foldod cloth 
over it, and set it in a warm place by the 
fire for four or five hours ; then knead it 
again for a quarter of an hour ; cover it 
over, and set it to rise again ; divide it into 
two or four loaves, and bake in a quick 
oven. It will take one hour to bake it if 
divided into loaves weighing two pounds 
each, and two hoius if the loaves weigh four 
pounds each, Tliis bread need only rise 
once, and if made of the best superfine flour

Baked Eggs. 
Time, five minutes. 

30. A piece of butter ; five eggs ; pepper 

and salt. , _ 

Well butter a dish, and break five eggs 
very carefully on it ; put on the top of each 
a little pepper and salt and a bit of butter, 
and put them into a slow oven until well set. 
Serve them up hot. 



Eevilled Eggs- 
Time to boil, from ten to twelve minutes. 

31. Four eggs ; half a teaspoonful of salt ; 
one full teaspoonful of anchovy sauce ; a little 

Cayenne. , . ^ , .

until they are cold. Cut them in halves ; 
flatten the ends a little to make them stand 
upright. Take out the yolks and mix them 
with the anchovy, Cayenne, and salt. Re- 
place the mixture in the eggs, and place 
them in a round dish, with small salad 
round ; either mustard and cress, or lettuces 
chopped very fine. 

Eggs a la Bonne Femme-

02. Three eggs; two or three slices of 
beetroot ; a slice or two of cold chicken, or 
any cold meat ; three heads of coss lettuce. 

Boil three fresh eggs for ten minutes, ro 
them to break their shells on the table ; shell 
them, cut them in halves, and just cut oft 
the point of the white so that they may 
stand well. Take out the volks and fill the 
white cup, thus ; two with beetroot (already 



boiled) cut into tiny dice ; two with cold 
chicken or meat cut into dice ; two wit li tmy 
dice of the yolks, piled up in them. Cut up 
some coss lettuce very nicely ; lay it on the 
dish, and place the eggs on it. 

Brawn. 

Oxford brawn is considered the best to 
purchase. The following recipes, especially 
the first, will be- found excellent for family 
use. 

Brawn. 

Time, three nights ; six hours to boil, three 

liours to get cold. 

33. Pickled porker's head ; two tongues ; 
two feet, and two extra ears ; four fried sau- 
sages ; some slices of boiled ox tongue ; 
dncd sage, pepper and salt, one teaspoonful 
of each for seasoning ; three tablespoonfuls 
of salt to cover the head . 

Cut the porker's head in half, and soak 
one night ; cover it with salt for one night, 
boil slowlv six hours. Let it get cold. T;\ke 
out the bones. Boil the two tongues, feet, 
and ears one hour and a half ; remove the 
bones and gristle. Cut all the meat into 
small pieces ; season with sage, pepper, and 
salt, well mi.Kcd. Cut the sausages into 
slices. Place slices of ox tongue, which 
should be of a nice red colour, in a pattern 
round the mould or tin ; put in the meat, 
and press it firmly down with a weight on 
the top. Let it stand one night. 

The tongues may be put in whole, if pre- 
ferred, about the middle of the mould. 



Plovers' Eggs. 
Time, two minutes,' 

5 1 Plovers' es'-gs must be boiled hard and 
served either hot or cold. For breakfast, 
line a little basket with moss and lay them 
in it If you have no basket, serve them 
on a folded tablenapkin, or shell them and 
pour Bechamel sauce over them. 

You may manufacture a satisfactory bas- 
ket for plovers' eggs, by lining one of the 
round baskets in which strawberries are sold 
with moss, both outside and ins.de, and 
bending a twig or wire over it for a handle. 

'rhis''basket of eggs is a great ornament 
to a breakfast table.

fingers.) Beat the yolk o'' an egg and bind 
the forcemeat with it ; let four eggs boil for 
ten minutes. Warm half a pint of rich 
brown gravy. When the eggs are boiled

ing the herbs and eggs all the time ; then 
pour them into the pan, and let them stand 
for a few minutes over the fire, but taking 
care to sejiarate the omelet gently from the 
bottom of the pan, and shaking it to pre- 
vent its burning ; fiy it for about five 
minutes on one side, and serve it doubled 
over. 

Ham or Tongue Ome'et-^

in a piece of bufter; put the yolks of six 
and the whites of three eggs into a plate, 
season with a little pepper and salt, and 
beat it well till very light and smooth ; stir 
in the grated ham or tongue. Put some 
butter into an omelet-pan, and when it just 
begins to bubble, whislc up the mixture, and 
pour it into the pan, stir i^ with a spoon one 
way until it thickens and becomes warm, 
and then fold the edges of the omelet over 
in an oval form. Brown it nicely, and serve 
as quickly as possible, as the lightness of an 
omelet is spoilt unless it is served inuiie- 
diately. It may be browned on the top with 
a salamander. 

Pigs' Kidneys. 
Time, fifteen minutes. 

43. Pigs' kidneys are prepared exactly as 
sheep's kidneys are ; they are nearly divided,

broiled over a clear fire. They are served 
quite plain, or with maltre d'hotel sauce, if 
preferred. 

Figs' Feet and Ears. 

Time, to boil, one hour and a half; to 
broil, ten minutes, 

44. Two onions ; one teaspoonful of made 
mustard ; two ounces of butter ; one tea- 
spoonful of flour. 

When you have cleaned and prepared the 
feet and ears, boil them ; then split the feet 
in halves, egjr and bread-crumb them, and 
broil them. Cut the ears into fillets, put 
them into a stew-pan with two sliced onions, 
two ounces of butter, and a teaspoonful of 
flour. When they are browned, take them 
up, add a teaspoonful of made mustard to 
the purdc, and lay them on a hot dish. Put 
the feet on the top of them, and serve. 

Or Fried in Batter. 
Time, twenty minutes. 

45. One egg ; one tablespoonful of flour ; 
one and a half gill of milk ; a pinch of salt ; 
a little lard for the pan. 

Clean the feet and ears carefully ; boii 
them gently, then take thenj up and lay 
them aside lor the morning. Make a nice 
batter of an egg, a tablespoonful of flour, a 
gill and a half of milk, and a pinch of salt. 
Split the leet in halves, and dip them and 
the ears into the batter. Fry them a nice 
brown, and serve on a table-napkin. . 

Pigs' Feet Soused. 
Time, one hour arid a half. 
46. Two feet ; one teaspoonful of salt ; 
three-qu&rters of a pint oi vinegar ; a quarter 



of a pint of the water in which they are 
boiled ; six pepper corns ; a little allspice ; 
four cloves ; a little mace. 

Scald the feet and scrape them clean ; if 
the covering of the toes will not come off 
without, singe them in hot embers, until 
they are loose ; then take them off. Some 
persons put the feet in weak lime-water to 
whiten them. Having scraped them clean 
and white, wash them and put them into a 
pot of warm,, b>it not boiling water, with a 
little salt. Let them boil gently till by turn- 
ing a fork in the flesh it will easily break, 
and the bones are all loosened, 'lake off 
the scum as it rises. When they are done 
take them out of the water and lay them in 
vinegar enough to cover them, adding to it 
a quarter of a pint of the water in which 
they were boiled. Add whole pepper and 
spice with cloves and mace. Put them in a 
jar. and cover them closely. 

Soused feet may be eaten cold from the 
vinegar, split in two from top to toe ; or 
they may be split in two, dipped in flour, 
and fried in hot lard ; or they may be broiled 
and buttered. 

But, in the latter case, they should be 
nicely browned. 

Anchovy Toast. 

47. Six or eight anchovies ; one and a 
half ounce of butter ; slices of toast. 

Bone and skin six or seven anchovies. 
After washing them very clean pound tliem 
in a mortar with an ounce and a half of 
butter, and then rub them through a sieve ; 
take some thin slices of bread, and cut them 
out with a tin cutter, into squares or rounds ; 
fry them brown in a little butter, and spread 
over them (when cold) the anchovy mixture. 
Wash some anchovies, cut them in four, and 
put a piece on the top of each slice of toast ; 
serve on a napkin garnished with crisped 
parsley. 

Madras Anchovy Toast. 

43. A piece of butter the size of an apple ; 
yolks of two eggs ; Cayenne pepper to taste ; 
half a teaspoonful of white wine, or a tea- 
spoonful of anchovy paste. 

Put a piece of butter upon a very hot 
plate ; add the well-beaten yolks of two 
eggs ; Cayenne pepper to taste ; lialf a tea- 
spoonful of white wine, or a tea.spoonful of 
anchovy paste ; mix well, soak hot toast in 
ij ;>r>.ri serve very hot. The toast should 
not be cut too thin. 

This is the receipt by which the officers of 
the Madras army prepare their celebrated 
anchovy toast.

Sausages. 
Time, twenty minutes. 

Cambridge sausages are thought the best 
for breakfast. But we advise our rcailers, 
if possible, to make their sausage meat at 
home, as tliey may then be sure of the ma- 
terials of whieli they aic made. If they 
cannot be home-made they should be pur- 
chased at a very respectable shop, so that 
no doubts may be entertained of them. 

Prick the sausages with a large needle or 
fine skewer ai; over, this will prevent the 
skin from cracking, broil them over a gentle 
fire for about twenty minutes. Serve very 
hot on toast. We prefer putting them into 
hot water for one minute before dressing, to 
extract the oil from the skin. Directions 
for making sausage meat will be found 
under tlie head of Fork. 



FISH. 



Fish is a ddicious adjunct to the dinner- 
table, and in some families may suffice for a 
good dinner by itself ; but it requires nice 
and careful dressing. What can be more 
unappetizing than a fish brought to table 
broken all to pieces, as we have seen it, or 
not half done— salmon red with Wood— cod 
nearly raw — or mackerel not properly 
cleaned ? It is a wicked waste of the pro- 
vision God has made for his creatures to 
thus spoil it, when a little attention and 
study may preserve it for us. 

And first, let great care be taken to well 
clean the fish before it is dressed. It is 
better to let the fishmonger clean it for you ; 
but if you are compelled to do it yourself, 
take care that you slit it low enough, so as 
not to leave any blood, &c., on the back- 
bone. We have been obliged to send fish 
from our own table unfasted in consequence 
of a careless cook neglecting this part of 
her duty. 

In almost all kinds of fish the portions to 
be removed are the giils, the alimentary 
organs, and the settlement of slime and 
other impurities inside and outside the fish. 
Dexterity must be used to cleanse the in- 
side thoroughly without making too large 
an incision, which disfigures the fish when 
it comes to table, and may m.ake it, if it is 
for boiling, watery. The sound, which 
adheres to the bone, must be lelt undis- 
turbed, but cleansed ; the hard and soft roe 
must also be left in their places ; and care 
must be taken not to injure the liver, but, 



with most fish, to replace it. Especial care 
must be taken not to break the gall, as that 
renders the fish very bitter. 

As a medium in which to fry, there is 
nothing better than pure oil, but it is ex- 
pensive, because the fisli must have abund- 
ance in the pan or it will not turn out well, 
and wear the bright gold hue that should 
characterize fried fish. 

If it be found inconvenient to use oil, 
plenty of good dripping or lard will do as 
well. 'Butter is apt to burn fish black, and 
make tnem soft. 

It is utterly useless, however, to provide 
fine oil or clear fat for frying, if the pan be 
soiled or smoked, for that will spoil the 
colour and the flavour too of the fish, be it 
dressed as carefully as it can be in other 
respects. Fish-kettles, with plates, of con- 
venient sizes, and kept scrupulously clean, 
are likewise necessary ; also a gridiron for 
broiling. These utensils are requisite for 
the methods of dressing fish which are 
generally most popular. 

For fricassees and stews, good stewpans 
of different sizes will be needed ; stewpans 
lined with enamel are best, and if they are 
of first-rate quality, and cleaned with care, 
they will last a great number of years. 
Stewpans are most convenient made of an 
oblong shape, and with the handle set on at 
one end. These are much more convenient 
to handle when iull, than those with the 
handles on the broad side ; and they are 
likewise more easy to place on the fire or

stove, from standinjr on any narrow space 
at lil)crty, instead of requiring a good width 
of fire. Placed on the wide way, one 
stewpan will occupy a range of medium 
size ; whereas those which can be placed 
the narrow way can stand several side by 
side on the same space. Engravings of the 
fish-kcllles now used are given in Kitchen 
Utensils. 

Apparatuses for cooking au grathi should 
have a place in every kitchen. The prin- 
ciple of cooking au grattn is to place fire 
both above and below the food to be so 
dressed, which of course effectually keeps 
in the juices of the viands, and their full 
flavour. The utensil used for the purpose 
in France is a. four de campagne, a kind of 
long-handled chafing-dish with a flat bot- 
tom — for holding hot charcoal. The thing 
whicii has to be dressed au graliti is put in 
a deep dish which will stand fire, and in 
which also it is served ; this is placed on a 
stove where the under side of the fish or 
meat in it will cook slowly, and the four de 
campagne is placed on the top of the disli, 
when the heat from the hot charcoal at the 
same time cooks the upper surface of the 
fish. The manner in whicli the steam is 
kept in renders the flavour excellent. 

Boiled fish should always be washed and 
rubbed carefully with a little vinegar, before 
tiiey are put into the watar, except salmon 
und trout. 

Put the fish into cold water, in which you 
have thrown a good quantity of coarse salt 
(about four ounces to one gallon of water). 
Allow for time of cooking about ten 
minutes for each pound of fish ; but when a 
fish weighs a good many pounds, allow six 
minutes a pound for the whole — i.e., a fish 
of ten pounds may be dressed in an hour ; 
or you may try if it be done by passing a 
knife next to the bone. If the fish parts 
easily from it, it is done ; if it adheres at all 
to the bone, it is not done. Under-dressed 
fish is very unwholesome. 

Take the fish from the water the moment 
it is done, or it will become woolly. If it is 
dressed before you are ready to serve it, 
itake. it out of the water, set the drainer 
across the kettle, and lay a folded napkin 
over the fish. 

Supposing you chance not to have a fish- 
kettle, and yet wish to dress fish by boiling, 
you may manage thus : put the fish in a 
circle on a dinner-plate, and tie a napkin 
over ii ; then piit ii in a largt: iauccpun. 
When it has boiled long enough, take it up 
carefully by the cloth, drain off all the water, 
and slide the fish on a white napkin neatly 
folded on a dish. Garnish and serve. 
Fresh-water fish have often a muddy taste 



and smell, which may be got rid of by 
soaking them in strong salt and water before 
they are cooked. 

t>alt fish should be soaked in water bjiore 
boiling according to the time it ha= been in 
salt. When it is hard and dry, it will re- 
quire thirty-six hours soakiiig before it is 
divsscd, and the v ite*- must be changed 
three or four times. When fish is not very 
salt, twenty-four hours, or even one night, 
will suffice. 

Crimped fisli must be put into boiling 
water, and when it has been placed on the 
fire and re-boils, pour in a teacupful of cold 
water to check it, and let it simmer a few 
minutes. Salmon is put into warm water 
to be dressed. 

Cod, whiting, and haddock are better if 
kept a day before boiling ; just putting a 
little salt on them the night before dressing. 

But some great cooks have advocated 
dressing cod quite fresh ; from our own ex- 
perience we prefer it kept for twelve hours.* 

To Fry Fish, 

59. Cleanse them thoroughly, dry them 
on a folded cloth, dredge flour lightly over 
tiiem, brush them with a well-beaten egg, 
then dip them in fine bread-crumbs. 

Have ready enough fine oil, or melted 
lard or beef dripping (clarified), to entirely 
cover the fish. Place the frying-pan over u 
clear fire. Let the lard reach boiling-point, 
and then immerse the fish in it. You may 
try whether the fat is hot enough by letting 
a drop of cold water fall into it from the end 
of your spoon. If the hot fat spits it is 
ready for use. Then fry, turning the fish 
(when one side is browned) to the other. 
When it is done lay it on a cloth, or on 
white blotting-paper, to drain off all the 
fat ; or put it on a reversed sieve for a little 
while. Serve it extremely dry on a white 
cloth or embossed fish paper. 

To Broil Fish. 

60. A clear fire is required. 

Rub the bars of your gridiron with drip- 
ping or a piece of beef suet, to prevent the 
fish from sticking to it. Put a good piece 
of butter into a dish, work into it enough 
salt and pepper to season the fish. Lay the 
fish on it when ic is broiled, and with a 
knife blade put the butter over every part. 
Serve very hot. .. 

Bfttt.flr for Trvina TiaTi. 

61. One tgg ; a little flour ; pepper and 
salt ; mace and nutmeg ; butter or oil.

Boiled Turbot. 

Turbot is the finest of the flat fish. 
It is very expensive, but can sometimes be 
bought cheap, if it happens to be disfigured 
by having red spots on the under side. But 
these can be removed by rubbing salt and 
lemon on them ; and in the new way of 
sending up turbot with the dark sule 
garnished, they would not matter in the 
least degree. 

It has been celebrated from the days of 
ancient Greece and Rome. Its usual weight 
is from fivp to twenty pounds. A good fish 
shoi'la be thick ; th :; flesh is firm, and the 
usli stiff when it is fresh. 

In season from March till August. 

Time, one hour, for ten pounds, more or 
less according to weight. 

62. Empty the fish, wash the inside, rub a 
little salt over the outside to help remove 
the slime. Put it in water to cleanse it, 
change the water several times. Pour 
plenty of cold spring water into a fish- 
kettle, add to each gallon of water four 
ounces of salt, and a quarter of an ounce, 
or less, of saltpetre. Let this dissolve while 
you prepare your turbot. Make an incision 
in the skin of the back nearly to the bone, 
to prevent the skin of the white side from 
cracking. Do not cut off the fins, these are 
considered a delicacy. Place the turbot on 
the fish plate, and put it into the water, 
which should quite cover it. Let it boil 
slowly and skim the water very carefully. 
Then let it simmer gently for about half an 
hour if it is of great size, according to the 
proportionate weight. 

When it is done lift up the fish plate and 
let it drain ; keep it very hot while you 
garnish it with lobster coral (which must be 
rubbed through a fine hair sieve) ; then slide 
it gently on a hot dish, on which a folded 
damask napkin or an ornamental fish paper 
has been placed previously. 

It is usual to serve the under or white 
part of the turbot uppermost, and certainly 
the contrast of the pure white skin with the 
lobster coral ornamentation on it, makes it 
the most inviting-looking fish served. But 
epicures have lately preferred it served with 



the d.irk side or back upwards, on account 
of some supposed superiority of the flesh of 
the fish on that side. It is given in our 
engraving in the newest mode of serving it ; 
but not being an epicure ourselves, we 
prefer llie old and more piciuresciuc fashion. 
Garnish with sprigs of curled parsley and 
slices of lemon alternately. 

Sauce. — Lobster, shrimp, or anchovy, in 
a tureen. 

Twice-laid Turbot. 

Time, twenty minutes. 

63. The remains of a turbot boiled the 
day previously ; two t.iblespoonfuls i;! flour ; 
one quart of milk ; a small bunch of parsley ;_ 
a b.ay-icaf and a little thyme ; a si)oonful of 
salt, and a saltspoon (not quite full) of 
pepper ; a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter. 

Pick the fish from its bones and warm it 
gently in salt and water. While it is doing 
make a sauce of the ingredients given above 
by mixing the flour and milk very smoothly, 
adding the herbs and seasoning, and stirring 
it over tlie fire till it is tolerably thick. Then 
lift it to the side of the fire, stir in a quarter 
of a pound of butter, and pass it through a 
sieve. Cover the bottom of the dish with 
this simple white .sauce, lay on it some of 
your fish, sprinkling it with white pepper 
and snit, then put more sauce, then more 
fish, till the whole is used up. Sprinkle 
breadcrumbs over it, and bake it in a hot 
oven for twenty minutes. Brown it, and . 
serve it in the same dish. 

Fillets of Turbot. 
Time, si.x minutes to each pound of fish. 

64. One small turbot ; one Ic/non ; a little 
pepper and salt, and a large lun/p of butter. 

Divide a small turbot down the middle of 
the back, next separate it from the fins, and 
raise the fish clean from the bones with a 
sharp knife ; divide it into oblong pieces, 
and put them in a stewpan with a large 
lump of butter ; the juice of a strained 
lemon, and a iittle pepper and salt. Set 
them over the firt, and turn the fillets to 
admit of tlieir being thoroughly dressed and 
browned on both sides. When done, drain 
them, and dish them in a similar way to 
cutlets, cover them witn either lobster, 
shrimp, or maitre d'hotel sauce. 

To Dress a very Small Turbot. 

65. One small turbot ; two ounces of 
grated cheese ; half a pint of white sauce, 
or butter melted in milk; some bread- 
crumbs. 

Boil a very small turbot ; pull it to pieces,

Cold Turbot. 

66. Three heads of 
eggs ; two ancliovies ; 
capers ; two or three giierkins. 

The cold turbot wiiich remains from a 
dinner does very well for a salad. Divide 
it into pieces of convenient size, and arrange 
them m a mould in the middle of the dish ; 
put lettuce, and Jiard-boiled etigs cut in 
quarters round; strew over alT slices of 
anchovy, capers, and gherkins. Then pour 
over without disarran,';ement some salad 
mixture. Cold turbot is excellent en 
Mayo7inaisc, or dressed after any of the 
receipts given for cold cod. 

Water Soucliy. 

67. Two quarts of water ; one bouquet of 
parsley. 

Plaice, floiuiders, or any freshwater-fish, 
are good for a souchy. Boil the fish ; stand 
aside the handsomest looking, and boil down 
one or two to rags in the liquor, of which 
there should be about two quarts ; boil in it 
also a bouquet of parsley. Pulp the fish 
which is boiled flown, and chop the jiarsley 
fine. Return them to the liquor, heat the 
fish in it, and serve it in a deep dish accompa- 
nied by thin slices of brown bread and butter. 

THE BEILL. 

A large brill is with difficulty to be dislin- 
guished from a small turbot when very well 
cooked. It is longer and not so round. 

In season from August to April. 

BriU. 
Time, ten to twenty minutes. ' 

63. One brill ; four ounces of salt to each 
gallon of water ; a tablespoonful of vinegar. 

Thoroughly clean and remove the scales 
from a fine fresh brill ; do not cut off the 
fins, but rubitoverwi'.h the juice of a lemon 
and a little salt ; set it in a fish-kettle with 
sutficient cold water, a handful of salt, and 
a tablespoonful of vinegar to cover it ; let it 
gradually boil, and then simmer for ten or 
twenty minutci, according to the size of the

JOHN DORY. 

A fi' 1 much estcctncd by epicures, and, 
unliku al. other table-fish, extremely ugly. 
It should be quite a foot long, and about 
four or fi' pounds in weight, and eaten very 
fresh. 1 lie thickest fish are the best. 



To Boil the John Dory. 

rime, three-quarters of an hour. 

69. Four ounces of salt ; one gallon of 
water. 

Prepare the fish as you do a turbot. Put 
it into a fish-kettle with sufficient water 'o 
cover it, with the salt in proportion to tl,. 
quantity of water ; bring it to the boil, and 
let it simmer gradually for about three-quar- 
ters of an ho'ir — more or less according to 
the size of your fish. Serve it in a neatly- 
folded napkin, and garnish with curled 
parsley and slices of lemon alternately. Lob- 
ster-sauce, shrimp-sauce, or plain melted 
butter can be sent to table in a tureen. 

FRESHWATER BREAM. 

A flat fish, very delicate, but seldom sent 
to,tab!e» 

To Bake Sea Bream. 
Time, forty minutes. 

70. One sea bream ; some veal-stuffing ; 
a quarter of a pound of butter ; a little 
pepiier, salt, and Cayenne. 

Thoroughly wash and wipe thpi bream in 
a cloth, but none of the scales must be re- 
moved. Hub over and inside a little pepper, 
salt, and Cayenne ; stuff it with veal stuff- 
ing, sew it up, and place it in a baking-dish 
with pieces of butter over it. Put it in a 
moderate oven for about forty minutes, and 
serve ; or it may be broiled, and served with 
white sauce. 

SALMON. 

Salmon is the king of fish, and is wel- 
come at every table. 

Salmon, like all other fish, should be stiff, 
and red in the gills ; the flesh should be of 
a bright full colour, and the. scales bright 
and silvery. Good judges prefer those which 
are small in the head, and thick in the neck. 
Before dressing the fish, scale it carefully, 
and cleanse it thoroughly. For the last 
named process, scrape away the blood and 
impurities with a knife, using washing as 
little as possible. 

It is the present fashion to dress salmon 
as fresh as possible ; but it is not really hurt, 
nay, is far more wholesome, if kept two or 
three days before it is cooked. ^Iost pro- 
bably this is the case with the fish we buy at 
the fishmonger's. Salmon, when out ot

should be a silvery, pinkish grey. 

Boiled Salmon. 
Time, according to wciglit. 

7t. One salmon ; four ounces of salt to 
one gallon of water. 

Salmon is put into warm water in'tcad of 
cold, in order to preserve its colour and set 
the curd. It should be thoroughly well 
dressed to be wholesome. 

Scale it ; empty and wash it with the 
greatest care. Do not leave any blood in 
the inside that you can remove. 

Boil the salt rapidly in the fish-kettle for 
a minute or two, taking off the scum ns it 
rises ; put in the salmon, first trussing it in 
the shape of the letter S, and let it boil 
gently till it is thoroughly done. Take it 
from the water on the fish-plate, let it drain, 
put it on a hot folded fish-napkin, and gar- 
nish with slices of lemon. Sauce : shrimp 
or lobster. 

Send up dressed cucumber with salmon. 

Middle Slice of Salmon-

enne ; one of salt. 

Take a slice of salmon of the weight yon 
require, pound it well in a mortar, and pass 
it through a sieve ; make it up into a ball. 
Pound up with it again an equal weight of 
butter. Mix with the panade sufficient eggs 
to prevent it from breaking; season with

the bars of the gridiron wi.li suet. 

Broiled salmon is extremely rich, and 
really requires no sauee ; neveilheless, ono 
especially intended lor it will bo found 
amid' t the sauces. 

The slices may also be simply dried in a 
cloth, floured, and bioied over a clear fire ; 
but they reciuiie the j^iealcst care tlieii to

THE COD. 

There is not a more useful, nourishing, or 
wholesome fish brought to our market than 
the cod. It is in the greatest perfection 
from October to Christmas. It may be 
bought nearly all the year round, but from 
February to July it is not so good as at other 
times. The ling is even larger than the cod, 
but inferior to it in quality. The hake is a 
capital fish, it frequents our south-western 
coast ; it should be all day sjMinkled with 
salt before it is eaten ; and it will turn out 
good dressed in any way that docs well for 
cod ; but the head is less available as food 
than that of the cod ; being long and lean. 
Haddock and whiting are excellent fish ; 
Ihey cannot be eaten too fresh. 

Cod should have a small head and a thick 
neck. It is better dressed in slices than 
boiled whole. It should possess a flavour 
of oysters. It should be put iuio cold water 
when cooked. 

Cod's Head and Slionldera- 
Time, half an hour or more. 

79. Cod's head and shoulders ; four 
ounces of salt to each gallon of water; a 
little horseradish. 

Rub a little salt down the bone and the 
thick part of the fisli, and tie a fold or two 
of wide tape round it, to prevent its break- 
ing. Lay it in a fish kettle with sufficien' 
cold water to cover it, with salt in the above 
proportion ; add three spoonfuls of vinegar, 
and a little horseradish. Let the water be 
brought just to the point of boiling ; then 
draw the fish-kettle to the side of the fue, to 
simmer gently lill the fish is done ; wliich 
can be ascertained by trying it with a fish 
slice, to see if tiie meat can be separated 
easily from the bone : skim it we!! and care- 
lully. When done, drain it and sli]) it oft 
the fish strainer on a napkin neatly loldcd in 



a dish. Garnish with double parsley, 
lemon, and the roe and liver of the cod. 

Browned Cod's Head. 

Time, according to size, half an hour more 

or less. 

80. Cod's head ; butter ; flour ; bread- 
crumbs. 

Boil the head, and take it up ; take off the 
skin ; set it before a brisk fire ; dredge it 
with flour, and baste it with butter. Wiicn 
it begins to froth, sprinkle fine bread-crumbs 
over it ; .and continue basting it until it is 
well frothed, and of a fine light brown, and 
serve it. Garnish with slices of lemon, and 
sauce to taste. 

It i. a great mistake to use small fried fisli 
as a garnish to boiled fish, as the appear- 
ance, and flavour too, of the one must be 
spoiled by the steam from the other. 

Crimped Cod. 
Time, fifteen minutes.- 

81. One pound and a half of crimped cod, 
and a large handful of salt. 

Take a pound and a half of crimped cod, 
cut it into slices, put it into a fish-kettle of 
boiling water, with a large handful of salt, 
and let it boil over a slow fire very gently 
for rather more than a quarter of an hour. 
Boil the liver, cut it into slices, and add it as 
a garnish to the cod, with tufts of double 
parsley. Serve it with oyster sauce in a 
tureen. 

Picked Cod. 

Time, fifteen minutes. 

82. About one pound and a half of dressed 
cod ; a little oyster and egg sauce ; two 
hard-boiled eggs ; and four parsnips, or 
some mashed potatoes. 

Pick about ■ pound and a half of dressed 
cod-fish into flakes, and put it in layers, 
with a little oyster and egg sauce alter- 
nately, in a stew-pan. Make it thoroughly 
hot. When it is done, pile if in the centre 
of a dish, and serve with mashed potatoes 
in a wall round it, browned with a salaman- 
der ; or garnish it with slices of hard-boiled 
;ggs, and parsnips cut into shapes. 

SALT FISH. 

Sal' -ih with a black skin are best. Fol- 
low ti.- instructions given previously as to 
soaking it a' night in water. 

Salt Fish. 

Time, one hour. 

Zt,. Put the cod in water tlie night before 
it isVantud, and let it soak all night ; boil

it ; lay it in a dish ; separate the flp.kos ; 
pour egg sauce over it, and sent it up hot. 

If it be prelerred, instead of the egg 
sauce, boil parsnips quite tender, mash them 
with biitter, cream or milk, and spread them 
round the salt fish. 

If the cod be very dry, soak it for several 
hours, Ijiy it out to dry in a cold place, and 
then soak it again for a number of hours. 
This double soaking is said to solten the 
driest fish. 

Salt Fish the Second Day. 
Time, twenty minutes. 

84. The remains of salt fish previously 
dressed ; same quantity of mashed potatoes 
and parsnips ; a quarter of a pound of 
butter ; a Utile Cayenne ; one egg. 

Pick tlie remains of die fish into small 
flakes ; butler the bottom of a pie-dish 
place it in alternate layers with the mashed 
parsnips and potatoes ; sprinkle a little Cay- 
enne in the dish. Bake for about twenty 
minutes in the oven ; turn it out on a dish ; 
garnish with a hard-boiled egg cut in slices, 
and pour over it a little melted butter, or 
instead of the slicjd egg, use egg sauce. 

Cod Sounds Boiled. 
Time, to boil, half an hour. 
85. Cod sounds ; half a pint of milk. 
Soak the cod sounds in warm water half 
an hour, then scrape and clean them ; boil 
them in milk and water until tender ; when 
done, serve them in a napkin with egg sauce. 
The salt must not be soaked out of tlie 
sounds, unless for fricassee. 



A Eeclierche Disli of Cod Sounds. 
Time, one hour. 

86. Cod sounds ; forcemeat of oysters ; 
bread-crumbs ; butter ; yolk of egg ; and 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; lardoons of pork 
or bacon ; butter, and flour. 

Boil some cod sounds until they arc ten- 
der, but not too much done ; turn them out 
and let them stand until they are cold. 
Make forcemeat of chopped oysters, bread- 
crumbs, butter, yolk of egg. ami seasoning 
of pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg, l-ili 
the sounds with the forcemeat, roll them up 
and skewer them, and lard down each side 
of each roll with pork or bacon ; dredge 
them with flour ; put them into a Dutch 
oven before the fire ; baste them with buttei 
until they are nicely browned, and serve 
them with oyster sauce over them. 

Broiled Cod Sounds. 
Time, three-(|uaiiers ol aa hour. 
87. Lay the cod sounds for a few mmutes 



in hot water, mh them with a little s.-ilt, 
clean them imtil thoy look wliite, and give 
them a gentle boil. Take them up, dry 
them, flour them, sprinkle salt and pepjicr 
over them, and broil them. Serve them 
with melted butter and mustard, or what- 
ever sauce may be preferred. 

To Broil Cod Sounds. 
Time, three-quarters of an hour. 

88. Two cod sounds ; half a pint of brown 
gravy ; a teaspoonful of soy ; alitl '--i pepper, 
salt, and mustard. 

Scald the sounds in hot water, rub them 
well with salt, pull off the skin, and put them 
to simmer till tender ; take them out of the 
l^an, flour, and broil them a nice blown. 
VVliile this is being done, season half a pint 
of brown gravy with pepper, salt, a tea- 
'^lioonlul of soy, and a very little mustard. 
Boil it with a piece of butter rolled in flour, 
pour it over the sounds, and serve hot. 

To Bake a Cod. 
Time, one hour and ten minutes. 

89. A small codfish ; a bunch of sweet 
herbs ; a quart of water; some bread-crumbs; 
a pint of shrimps ; three dozen oysters ; two 
tablespoonfuls of Harvey sauce ; one ounce 
of essence of anchovits ; three ounces of

Cold Cod. 

There arc many ways of utilizing .\ny re- 
mains of fine cod that there may be after tlie 
day it is cooked. Divided into flakes, and 
nicely seasoned with pepper, salt, and fra- 
ijrant herbs, it will make a good Mayon- 
naise for supper or luncheon. Similarly di- 
v.ded into flakes, and mixed into a good 
sidad, it is no bad substitute for lobster 
salad, and it makes capital rissoles, l-'or 
another rifacimento separate the flakes of 
ihc cold fish, stir it into rich new milk, 
cream, or tiiiii rich ineilcd budei', aiiange 
it in a i)ic-disli, spread mashed potatoes

fish-plate, in the d sh in which the fi-h has 
been served, and add to it liquor from the 
f-h-kettle to make enough. Flavour tliis 
with ketchup, lemon pickle, H.irvey's or 
other sauce, tomatoes, or any flavouring 
that may be preferred. Thicken it a little. 
cover it down close with a dish or close- 
fitting cover, and put it in the oven for half 
or three-quarters of an hour, according to 
the size of the dish and the heat of the oven.

STURGEON ( 

Sturgeon is so rare and expensive a fish 
that it seems useless to give direction? for 
dressing it in an ordinaiy Cookery Bouk ; 
but as no cook can foresee what may fall into 
her hands to dress, we will not leave her the 
helpless possessor of a sturgeon— the Queen's 
verv own fish. For every sturgeon cnught ^ 
in the English rivers is Her Majesty's born i 
vassal, and belongs to her, except those I 
which swim in the Thames below Temple 
Bar, which belong to the civic chief, the i 
Lord Mayor. | 

The sturgeon is as large as a shark, but 
has no teeth. It is a very delicious fish, and 
may be cooked like veal. 

To Roast S*nrgeon.

and bone it ; wash it clean, and fill the part 
from which the bene has been removed 
with veal stuffing, roll it in buttered paper, 
and tie it round to resemble a fillet of veal. 
Roast it in a Dutch oven before the fire, 
baste it constantly with butter, place it on a 
hot dish, and serve it with a cupful of rich 
beef gravy, a little lemon juice, and a wine- 
glass of white w ne. previously made hot. 
Vour the sauce round the sturgeon. 

Sturgeon Cutlets-

with two anchovies chopped up, a piece of 
onion, and of lemon peel, with a cupful of

of lemon, and with capers strewed over it. 

HALIBUT. 

Halibut is a flat fish of enormous size, 
being sometimes five or six feet long, nnd 
weighing from four to five hundred pounds. 
Being so large, it is of course sold in pieces.

and thicken it. Fry the collops, stew them 
in the liquor for half an hour, and flavour 
it with a little mace, a spoonful of whr.tever 
fish sauce may be preferred, and a spoonful 
of lemon juice. 

THE BASSE. 

The basse is a fish of a beautiful silvery 
appearance, which is very popular in some 
localities. It has been called the white sal- 
mon, a fish that it rather resembles in form, 
and in the firmness of the flesh. It is not 
very abundant in the London fish-shops. In 
the Channel Islands it is often plentiful in 
its season, but never, I believe, very cheap, 
and it abounds along our South coast, in 
St. George's and the Bristol Channel, and 
on different parts of the Irish coast. 

It is frequently eaten simply boiled, and 
the remarks made on boiling salmon will 
apply equally well to it, proportioning the 
time allowed to the size of the fish. Fish 
weighing us much as fifteen pounds have 
occasionally been caufiht, but they are usu- 
ally much smaller. Basse cut in slices may 
be'boiied, fried, or fiicassecd, following the 
plan given for dressing salmon in these 
various ways. It may be collared like sal- 
mon, or, if small, cut open and fried, with 
bread-crumbs, seasoning, and minced herbs, 
following the directions given hereafter for 
frying mackerel. , , .„ 

They are good dressed au court bouillon 
d'eau, with a little white wine. They are 
served on a napkin.

pared, fill the inside with butter well worked 
up with flour, sweet herbs minced fine, and 
seasoned with, pepper, salt, and grated nut- 
meg. Stew it with just liquid enough to 
prevent its burning, and squeeze lemon iuicc 
over it when it is taken up. 

WHITEBAIT. 

Time, one minute. 

In season. May, June, and July. 

no Wash and drain them in a colander, 
flour them well, and sift fine bread crumbs 
over them ; fry them in hot lard. As soon 
as they rise, take them out ; that will be in 
abotit one minute. . . i .» 

If you possess a wire basket, it is better 
to cook them in it instead of the pan. 

Serve them very hot. on a hsh cloth, 
sprinkling first a little salt over them. 



GHAYLING. 

In season, July and August. 
Grayling may be either baked or broiled. 
If small, they should be cut at the back,

iron over a dear fire for four or five minutes 
to broil and served on a dish, head and tail 
together, with the juice of a lemon squeezed 
over them.

with salt in the above proportion, with a 
small piece of saltpetre ; let them simmer 
for six or seven minutes after the water be- 
gins to boil, or longer should your fish be

necessary to just clean them; cut oft the 
fins, dry them in a cloth, and dredge .a little 
flour over them, melt half an ouiice of but- 
ter and beat into it the yolks of two egg?. 
Din the smelts into it, then into bread-crumbs 
finely grated, and plunge them into a frymg- 
pan of boiling fat ; let them fry gently, and 
a few minutes will make them of a bright 
yellow brown. Be careful not to take o.- 
the light roughness of the crumbs, or their 
beauty will be lost. When done, dish them

and hot. 

SOLES. 

Soles are either white soles or black soles, 
according to the colour of their b.ick. MhW'^' 
sized soles are of the best flavour. When 
they have roes they should be only used lor 
fillets, because they have then very little fla- 
vour. A large fine roe is not so great a re- 
commendation to a sole as inexpencnced 
housewives believe. 

In season from April to December. 

rilleted Soles. 

Time, ten minutes. 

127. Two soles ; two eggs ; and bread-

bone, and remove the head, fins, and tail. 
Sprinkle the inside with salt, roll them up 
irom the tail end upwards, and fasten them 
with very small skewers. If stnall or mid- 
dling sized soles, put hah a fish in each roll. 



Dip them into the yolk of one well beaten 
egg, and then into bread-crumbs : then into 
the eggs a second time, and again sprinkle 
them with crumbs ; fry them in hot lard or 
in clarified butter. 

Instead of rolling the fish they may be cut 
into pieces, and arranged in the form of a 
pyramid in the centre of a dish, and gar- 
nished with parsicy and slices of lemon.

one gallon of water. 

Well wash and clean the soles, cut off the 
fins, and put them into a fish-kettle with salt 
and water. Let them boil slowly, and then 
simmer until done, which must be according 
to the weight of the fish, a large one re- 
quiring about ten minutes, a medium size 
eight. When done serve them on a napkin, 
with the wliite side uppermost. Garnish

them into bread-crumbs, and fry them ot a 
hght brown, in sufficient boiling fat for them 
to swim in. When done, lay them on a 
cloth to absorb the grease ; dish them on a 
napkin neatly folded, and garnish with tried 
parsley. Plain melted butter or shrimp sauce 
may be sent to table with them.

EELS. 
It is one of the most painful tasks of the 
cook to kill and skin an eel, and it is effectec 
with some difficulty. By striking the head 
very hard it may be stunned, however and 
will then probably feel less pain. We be- 
lieve that there is also a mode of killmg them 
by cutting through the vertcbroe near the 

Take a doth in your hand ; hold the ccl 
by the head ; cut the skin round the neck, 
and turn it a little way down ; then pull the 
head one way and the skin the other, and it 
will come off ; open the fish, take out the 
inside, being careful not to break the gall,

LAMPREYS. 

Rich but very ii^^ly fish, unlikely to fall

T^E CONC'R. 
Th'' conger may with justice consider 
himself an ill-used fish, since, by many, he 
iscondemr/' -mtried, and loaded with h?rd 
names, V .icn are quite undcirved; wher^is 
a good conger eel, well cooked, is more 
wholesome, more nutritious, and nicer than 
more recherche und morelar ' . vi.-'nds. In 
addition to being '■< ry nice, and more 
wholesome than mo' ^er kinds of fish, it 
has the merit of gr :b! lance in our 
seas ; and if the sup> of c markets with 
it were encouraged by the free use of it by 
buyers (which it is not, on account of the 
unfounded prejudice against it), we might 
have in it a fish .as solid and as nutritious as 
butcher's meat, at from 2d. to 4d. a pound 
in our dearest maricets. This noble fish is 
fully deserving of free use, and protection

parts ofli.e fisli nr<* adapted forcli'tercnt

for soup, because the ricli gelatinous pick- 
in^; about the first gives thickness to the 
soup, and the tail is too l)ony to be as ap- 
propriate as till" centre cuts to dress other 
ways. The portions nc.\i to the head offer 
good cuts (tiie number dependent on the 
leiv^th and si .e of the fish) for stutfing, nnd

Stewed Conger. 
Tiiiif*, according to size. 

141. A confer eel : a bunch of sweet 
herbs ; one onion ; pepper, salt, and mace ; 
water or bio; I ; a liitle flour. 

Cut the conger into piecs as for frying, 
dry and flour the pieces, and brown them in 
a frying-pan. Put theni into a stew-pan 
with a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion cut 
in quarters, seasoning of pepper and salt, 
and of spice, if it be liked, and enough 
water, or broth, nearly to cover the fish. Let 
it stew gently until it is cooked enou£;b, 



thicken the gravy with flour just enough to 
take off the richness that may have risen to 
the top, and serve the conger witli the gravy 
round it. 

'I'hc gravy may bed.ivourcdwith tomatoes, 
chutney, or any other sauce. The stesvcd 
conger is nice with oysters ; open them, and 
save the liquor, mi.\ it with a little flour, use 
it to thicken the gravy, as mucli as neces- 
sary, let it just boil up, and put in tlie oys« 
tcrs long cnoui^h for tliem to get hot. 

Baked Ganger. 
Time nc hour, less in a quic't oven. 

1.42. 1 akc such a piece of fine conger as 
would be chosen for boiling : make a stuff- 
ing, and stuff it as mentioned for boiled 
conger. Put it into a pie dish or a baking 
disli, with a pint of w.ater, lay pieces of 
butter over the fish, flour it well, and put it 
into a moderate oven ; baste it often with 
the liquor while it is cooking, and when it 
is almost done thicken the liquor with flour, 
just enough to coiiect any little richness 
that may float on the top of it ; not more. 
Baked conger may be varied in many ways. 
It is very nice with potatoes haked under it: 
but as there must be liquor in the dish with 
which to baste the fish, to prevent the skin 
from,gettingdryand hard, they will not brown 
on the outside. The gravy may be thickened 
with tomatoes, or with tomato sauce, and 
this is particularly nice. It may be taken 
from the liquor, and eaten with dressed 
cucumber and early potatoes. It may be 
flavoured with or eaten with any sauce that 
is nice, and it will be excellent any way A 
good i'avouring for a change, is .1 table- 
spoonlul of lemon pickle, the sam ; of 
walnut ketchup, and a dessert spooal I qI 
soy. 

Fried Conger. 

Time, twenty to twenty-five minutes, 
or longer. 

1^3. Conger ; egg ; bread-crumb?. 

Cut the conger into slices an inch and a 
half or two inches thit , or a little thicker, 
according to the size of the fish. This is 
the best way ti) cut congei for frying, and 
most other purposes for vvliich it may require 
similar subdivision ; because by it the solid 
'ack of the hsh and tiie richer under part 
go together, which they do not when collops 
are cut longitudinaliy. Cover the fish with 
egg and bi -ad-c uinbs, and fry it in plenty 
of fat, made to boil before the fish is put in. 
Take care that the frying-pan is pcricctly 
clean, and that the fish is fried to a bright 
colour. Serve it with lemon to scjueeze over 
it, plain melted butter, oyster sauce, shrimp 
sauce, or any ^^ucc preferred.

PIKE. 

This voracious river fish depends greatly 
upon the manner in which it is dressed. We 



have e.iten -xcellcnt "Jacks." as they are 
called in ne midland counties, and others 
fjuite undeserving of approbation. It ou^s;ht 
always to be baked or roasted, and not 
boiled ; but as some families dress it in the 
latter manner, we give directions for it. 
The fins are usually cut off it, and it must 
be very carefully scraped and cleaned. 
In season from September to March. 

To Boil Pike. 
Time, half an hour to one hour. 

148. Pike ; twelve oysters ; half of a 
French roll; two eggs; lemon; sweet herbs; 
pepper ; salt ; nutmeg ; a lump of butter ;

When you have taken out the gills, 
cleaned and thoroughly washed the fish, 
make a forcemeat of a dozen chopped oys- 
ters, the crumb of half, or a whole French 
roll, a little lemon peel shred fine, a lump of 
butter, a few sweet herbs, the yolks of two 
well beaten eggs, seasoned to your taste 
with pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Mix all 
together and stuff the fish : sew it up. and 
fasten it with the tail in the mouth with a 
small skewer. Put it into a fish-kettle of 
boiling water with a wineglassful of vinegar 
and a tablespoonful of salt. If it is of a 
middling size, it will be done in about half 
an hour ; or, if large, one hour. Serve it 
up with melted butter and a lemon, or with 
anchovy sauce. , Garnish with pickled bar- 
berries.

To Choose Lobsters. 

164. 71ie heaviest are the best, nnd very 
often a good small-sized lobster will weigh 
heavier than a large one. 

'l"he male is the best for boiling, the flesh

may easily distinguish the hen lobster by 
its broader tail, and the two ufipermost fins 
within the tail 1 .-ing le.ss stiff and hard than 
those of the male lobster. Men lobsters are 
best for sauce or salad, on account of their 
coral.

It is clone thus :— 

Put info a lat^f kettle water cnoupili to 
cover the lobster, with a quarter of a pound 
of salt to every gallon of watrr. 

Whon it boils fast put in the lob'^ter, //rad

'the lobster is not easy to hold thus over the 
hot sieam, but we are sure any humane conk 
will do it. If the h-ad goes in first it is 
killed instantly. Hull it briskly for lialf an 
hour, tlien take it from the hot water with 
the tongs, and lay it to drain. Wipe off all 
the scum from it '; tie a little piece of butter 
in a cloth and rub it over with it.

bwwd in this way (to facilitate getting them 
crat«^ the shells) before dressing them other

the little hairy apprndncrc to be found at the 
root of the liltlu member shaped like a 
tontruc. To the mnsspls. tluis prcpaicd, 
put half a pint of the liquor saved, and if 
there is not cnoii,!:;li of it, eke out llie 
quantity with a little of the liquor in which 
tiny wore bf)iled, pouicd off c'< ir. Put in 
a blade of innce, tliicUi-n it with a piece of 
biiitrr rolled in Hour. !et them stew gently 
for a few minutes, and serve them on toast. 

HEBRINGS. 

T94. Herrings are the most important of 
our I3rit sh fish, forminq; one of the sources 
of our wealth, and feeding great numbers of 
our people. 

Still we seldom sec them on a gentleman's 
t.able ; fashion perhaps, or the absurdity of 
a dislike for that which is abundant and 
common, preventini; us fiom usin.;^ them as 
much as wc do other lisli. We have heard 
assigned as another reason that the great 
number of small bones which they contain 
render them dangerous food for children or 
old peo|)Ie. 

'Ihe herring is a very rich and wholesome 
fish, however, and we recommend all good 
housewives to give it a place at their tabic. 

To Boil Herrings. 

Time, tsventy minutes. 

In season from May to October. 

195. Some scraped horseradish ; vinegar, 
and salt. 

Clean and wash the fish ; dry them in a 
cloth, and rub over them a little vinegar and 
salt. Skewer them with their tails in :heir 
mouths, lay them on a strainer in a stewpan, 
and wiien the water boils put them in, and 
let them conf iiuie simmering slowly for .about 
twentv nunutcs. When they are «lone, 
drain and place them in the disli with the 
heads turned into the centre, garnish with 
£.craped horseradish, and serve with parsley 
and butter sauce. 

To Bako Herrings. 
Time, one hour. 

196. Two herrings ; a large spoonful of 
popper ; twelve cloves ; a teaspoonful of 
salt ; two bav-leaves, and some vinegar. 

Clean .and wash your herrings, lay them 
on a dish or board, and nib well over and 
into them a spoonful of pepiier, one of salt, 
and twebe cloves pouiuliil. Lay them in 
an eartlien pan. cover them with vinegar, 
add two or three bay-leaves, and tic them 
over with a thick paper. Put thcni into a 
niodeiate oven, and bake them lor an liour. 
To be eaten cold. 



To Smoke Herrings. 
Time, twenty-four hours. 

197. Herrings and some sawdust. 

Clean and lay some fresh herrings in salt 
and a little s.altpetre for one night ; then run 
a stick through their eyes, and liang them 
in ii row. Put some sawdust into an old 
cask, and in the midst of it ix heater red lit>t ; 
h.uig the stick on which you have threaded 
the fish over the smoke, and let them remain 
for twenty-four hours. 

Fried Herrings. 

Time, si.\ or eight minutes. 

193. Clean and scale the fish, and dry them 
thoroughly in a cloth. When they are quite 
dry, fry them to a bright C'lloiir. The 
herring, being so rich a fish, should be fried 
with less butter than fish of most kinds, and 
well drained and dried alterwards. A nice 
sauce to eat with herrings is sugar, mustard, 
and a little s.a't and vinegar. Some serve 
melted butter, but herrings are too rich to 
eat with a rich sauce. Crisp parsley maybe 
used as .a garnish. Fry spr.its in the same 
way ; they require no sauce, unless it may 
be a little lemon pickl>; or ketchup. 

Broiled Herrings. 

Time, si.\ or eight minutes. 

J99. Herrings; a spoonful of flour; a 
qi art r ol a pint of table beer or ale ; a slice 
of onion; six ounces of whole peppers ; one 
ounce of butter ; a spoonful of nuistard. 

f Mean and dry the lish. cut off their heads, 
flour them and broil them. Break up the 
heads and boil them for a quarter of an 
hour in a lit'le t.-ible beer or ale, with a little 
whole pepper and a slice of onion ; strain off 
the liquor, thicken it with butter and tlour, 
beat mustard up with it. and serve it in a 
tureen to cat with the herrings. 

Homc-salted Herrings. 

200. Have the fish as fresh out of the sea 
as possible, clean and scale them with 
wiping, but do not wash them. Pepjier 
them slightly, and sprinkle them well over 
with salt. They ate very nice for breakfast 
fried. If they arc to be eaten the next 
morning they should be turned after lying in 
the salt twelve hours ; if they are for the 
morning after, turn them when they have 
lain twenty-four hours. 

OI7BNET8. 

There are several kinds of this fish, the 
grey, red, streaked yellow, and sappharine ; 
of these the last is the best, but they arc all 
very nice flavoured.

onion, melted butter, and Harvey sauce. 



Boiled Gurnets. 
Time, two hours. 

202. Thoroughly clean your fish, and boil 
them in a fish-kcttlc of very strong salt and 
wafer, serve them on a napkin, and send 
anchovy sauce, or plain melted butter to 
table with them. 

Fish Cake of Cold Fish. 
Time, two hours. 

203. The remains of cold fish ; cod ; soles; 
turbot, &c. ; a bunch of sweet herbs ; bread- 
cnunbs ; cold potatoes ; a sprig of parsley ; 
one or two eggs ; pepper and salt ; quite I 
half a pint of water. 1 

Pick the meat from the fish \\ ith two , 
forks, and mince it very fine ; mix it well I 
with equal quantities of bread-crumbs and i 
cold mashed potatoes, and season it highly 
with pepper and salt. Put the bones, heads, 
and Irimminyi* »)f the fish Into a stewpan, 
with the s>^eet herbs, parsley, and a little 
pepper and salt ; pour over it about a pint 
of water, and let it simmer slowly for an 
hour and three-quarters, or hmgei, if not 
done enongh. Make the minced fish, bread, 
and potatoes into a cake, bmding it with the 
white of a beaten egg ; brush it over with 
the yolk, strew it well with bread-crumbs, 
and fry it lightly. Pour over it the strained 
gravy, and set it over a gentle fire to slew 
slowly for nearly twenty minutes, stirring it 
occasionally. Garnish it with slices of 
lemon. 

To Dress Cold Fish. j 

304. Some cold ftih ; fowl ; game, &c. ; 
9om. lettuce ; a cucumber ; beetroot, and j 
Hard-boiled eggs. I 

Place at the bottom of a dish a layer of 
cut lettuc*. place over it some cold picked

quantity of bread-crumbs ; a piece of but- 
ter ; one onion ; a sm.all bunch of sweet 
herbs ; pepper, salt, and one or two eggs 
a little lemon pickle. 

Herrings and similar rich fish are espe- 
cially good for the purpose, and even cold 
salt fibh will do, on account of its savouri- 
ness. Pick all the meat from the bones, 
pound it in a mortar, or pull it to pieces 
with a silver fork ; mix it well with an ecjual 
quantity of bread-crumbs, and some butter, 
season it with an onion chopped very fine,

'iThis French dish should be made of 
several different kinds of fish, and tho more 
variety the better ; pilchards, mackerel, and 
other rich fish being excluded. '1 he best 
kinds are haddocks, gurnet, whiting, and 
fish of that description, with any small fish 
there may be at hand. Place in a stewpan 
an onion cut into five or six pieces, a piece 
of garlic, some parsley minced fine, a piece 
of Seville orange peel, pepper, salt, spice. 
and a pinch of saffron, and water barely 
enough to cover the fish, and afterwards to 
be put into it with a very little oil ; the oil 
and the saffron are to be measured accord- 
ing to taste. Let this mixture cook well, 
cut the fish in pieces, put it in the stewpan. 
stir all well together, and put it over :i fierce 
fire The name boitillabaise indicates that 
the' cooking should be very (luick ; the 
sooner, therefore, it comes to a boil, and the 
faster it boils the better. It should cook 
enough in about a quarter of an hour, but 
some kinds of fish render it necessary to 
allow five or six minute." longer. '1 he in- 
dispensable ingredients in a bouillabaisse 



arc. onion, garlic, pepper, salt, spice, pars- 
ley orange peel, saffron, and oil ; the quan- 
titv of course, must depend on the quantity 
offish to be dressed. I-ennel, sage, or a 
bay leaf may be added nt the option of the 
cook. If there is liver to the fish, it should 
be put in only long enough to cook. 

Pickled Ormeri. 
Time, four hours. 

2o3. Ormcrs; three bay-leaves; a few 
white peppers ; slices of whole ginger ; salt, 
and vinegar. j i . 

After your ormcrs arc well cleaned, neat 
them till quite tender, put them in a stew- 
pan cover them well with water, allowing 
for the boiling. Tut in three bay-leaves, a 
few whitii peppers, and some whole ginger 
sliced. Roil gently for four hours, or till 
tender, then add the salt and vinegar to 
your taste. If meant to keep long, add 
more vinegar than for present use ; or take 
the whole" of the water in which they have 
boiled awav, wash the stewpan, put them in 
again and cover them with vinegar, leaving 
them to boil only a few minutes.

SOUPS. 



The cook who would succeed in sending 
good soup to table must take care that she 
has strong and excellent stock ready for it. 
and the economical housewife will soon hnd 
that stock does not always require meat to 
be bought for its production. 

The water in which mutton has lieen 
boiled, the liquor left from dressing a calf s 
head, the bones taken from rolled ribs of 
beef.' or from any boned joint, hare, or 
poultry, will make excellent stock for a 
family soup. Fish bones will also produce 
a good jelly for it. The trimmings of large 
joints or cutlets, the shanks of mutton, the 
shank of a ham. the large bone of the sir- 
loin of beef, will all add to the stock-pot. 
and supply a good foundation for her soup. 
Ox-cheek carefully nonaged, and sheep s 
head and trotters, also make excellent stock 
with a flavouring of ham or anchovy for the 

^°Soup should never be made with hard 
watei, unless it is of green-pc.as. in which 
case the water must be hard to preserve their 

colour. ^ - 

The rule as to quantity is : a quart ol 
water to a pound of meat without bone ; 
but whenever this quantity of water is di- 
minished, the soup is increased m strength 
and richness. ' 



Meat shotikl be put into the soup-kettle 
with very litde water at first, and with a 
piece of butter to keep it from burning. It 
should be let stew very slowly till the essence 
of the meat is extracted. Very long, very 
slow stewing, is the certain way to procure 
good soup. , .. . 

"The more haste the worse speed is 
the proverb of the soup-kettle. 

Skim the soup frequently also, and do 
not let it cool until it is quite made. I^t 
the meat of which your soup is made be 
freshly killed, and very lean, every particle 
of fat should be removed omit. Onions 
should be put in the soup soon after it is 
begun to be nride ; herbs, carrots, and celery 
three hours afterwards ; turnips, or any de- 
licate vegetable, just before the soup is 
finished. When celery is out of season, 
the seeds of the plant, tied up in a pu- f 
of clean muslin, will ; > the favour equally 
well. 

To Co r Sonpi. 
A piece of bre."d t'-..asted very brown 
may be simmered in the soup for a short 
time before it is d -\e, and will give it a 
brown colour. The r.dniry colouring, 
however, is done, by putUii.i a little burnt 
brown sugar into it. The uugar should be

put into n ^nucppnn witli a piece of butter 
the size of a walnut, nnd .iRlass of ketchup ; 
it should l)L" inriii'd !o;:».'thcr, and then 
put into flu* soiii>-ki.tlle. Kurlhcr directions 
arc given in "Soups." For those who do 
not dislike tlaMu, burnt onions arc an ini- 
provcme'W, l)otli as lo colour and llavour. 

Coloui in;; to be kept for use is niide thus : 
n fjill of w.iter, a (jiiarttr of a pound «.>f 
lump su;;ar, and half an ounce of roll butter, 
should be si-t over the tire \n the sniillesf 
fryin,!,'-pan, and stirred till it is of a Uu<^\\\ 
lirown colour ; add to it half a pint of wai<'r, 
boil .ind skim if, let it pet cold, and then 
bottle and cork it down for future use. 

The navourintj of soups inuit in a groat 
measure dt-pend (jn the cook ; her taste, 
therefore, sliuuld be discriminating and di^li- 
cate. She shoulil be careful in the use of 
keteluips and sauc(!S, thouRh they are both i 
useful and important. Cow-heel, lalfs- 
fict, and ox tail soups, all require flavoiir- 
iiii;, and wiM bear a litl.'c sauce or ketchup, 
but it should never be overdone. 

Clear soiip'i have b -en the fashion of late 
years: piin'es, such as pea-soup, iS:e., beiiii> 
lint so often seen, except at o I J - fa i': ion fit 
peoj)le's tables. To el.infy soup break an 
I'!,'.!.;, and throw the white and the shell to- 
Ketlier into a basin, but fake care not to let 
a jiariicle of the yolk f,'o in. 

Beat the white wili to a stiff froth, nnd 
mix It by dejjrees, and very com|)letely with 
the soup, winch should then be put on the 
fire and stirred till it aijain boils. Take it 
off the moment it boils, cover it close, and 
let it stand for a quarter of an hour ; then 
strain it off. When a soup is clarilied it wiil 
bear a stronr^er flavouiini,', as it loses a por- 
tion of its own in the process. Forcemeat 
balls and whole cf^gs are sometimes put into 
soups, but they are not as fashionable as 
they usett to be. 

Summary of Dircctior a for Making Soups 

Take eare that the «^oup-kettleor stewpan 
is perfectly clean and free from any i;ria.se 
or sand. An iron soup-pot slunild be'wasiied 
the in jineiit you have (inished using it, wiih 
n jiiece of soda the size of a small nuinui;. 
dissolved in hot w;'ter, lo remove all gie.isi- 
iicss or taste of onion. A tea.s])i)ouUil of 
pot.isli will answer the same purpose. 

kemember that il^ui boiling i:> iiccessarv 
to III. ike /^uod soup. 

Do not uncover the soup-ketile more 
frequently than necessary lor skimming it 
clean ; but if your soup is too weak, do not 
cover the pot in boding, as the water will 
evaporate in steam and leave your liquor 
Stronger. SSkiin frequently ; it is important 



tint every portion of scum should be re- 
nu)ved from the soup. Pour in occasionally 
a little CO il wafer, which wiil cause the al- 
bumen to rise in abuutlanf scum, or if you 
put in the reiiuir'jd quantity of salt with'ihu 
meat it will cause the scum to rise ; but the 
cup of fresh wafer is much the better mode 
of helping thi; soup to clear itself. 

Alw.iys stir your soup with a wooden 
spoon. 

lA't the soup be quite free from scum be- 
fore the vei;i'i.il)les .ire put in. 

Do not drown your incu in water, but 
dr.uv the juices out slowly by putting it into 
thf stcwpan with only a very little w.iter and 
a piece of butter, to keej) it from burning, 
and ihcn add the given quantity of water 
lo it. 

It will take six or eight hours to extract 
the essence from a few pounds of beef. 

it is better to make vour soup the day 
before it is required, because then the lat 
V( 1 . ,;\ke at the top of it and can be easily 
t : . '1 'iflf, and you can judge of the gootl- 
'..> t,!' your soup by the consistency and 
5j:!i!iiti.ii of the jelly. 

T'l • water in which meat or fowls have 
bc( > iioiled will tnake good broth, but for 
.soup add a little gravy beel to it. 

Vegetables to be added to soup should be 
well cleaned, washeil, and picked. 

it is very diflicuU to give a perfect mea- 
surenii-nt of seasoning, as the tastes of 
|)eople differ considerably with regard to if, 
aii(i the cook must conform to that which 
suits the palates of her emi)loyers ; but, in a 
lough way, it is usual to add about a tea- 
spoonful of salt to a pound of meat, and 
pepper according to taste, some naturally 
insipid broths and soups requiring more ; 
very s.ivoury sou|)s less. 

It is better to season too little than too 
liigh'y. 

I'ut fresh meat into cold water to stew for 

soup. If you make soup of already cooked 

meat, pour hot, but not boiling water over it. 

'lime and attcr.iiou arc required toachievo 

a good boup. 

Stock. 

Make your dark stock of beel ; mutton 
':;ives a peculiar and tallowy taste unless it 
IMS been previously ro.isted ; tia;n it may 
help, but it will not do to ///.//r stock alone. 

Let voir meat be fresh and lean ; cut it 
in tiny pieces. iJiaw flu; juices of the meat 
out before you add the water, by putting it 
in a stewpaii with half a pint of water (or 
less) and a quarter of a pound of butter, 
and letting it stew till a glaze is formed on 
the pan ; Uien set it aside and let it simmer

It boil, and put in Ihi- broken bones in ;i 
ba£j, and the gri>tly part of cold meat, 
trimmings, ike, ike. ; for, fn-m the boms, 
.IS has been already said, you will get gela- 
tine, the nutritious p;ut of the itock. 'Ihey 
should be well broken up ; the smaller the 
better, so as to present the larger amount of j 
surface. | 

Add fl.ivouring and vi-^etables, and then 
let the stock simmer again. 

Six or eight hours will m.ike it fit for use ; 
tij preserve its flavour ii will bo well then to 
remove it from the lire ; but do not let it 
<•,>()/ till it is quitw' made. 

Let it st.Tiid during the night ; the next 
day t.tke off the fat, and put it by in a stone 
j,\r for use. 

If your stock is made in an uncovered 
stewpan it will be all the stronger, for water 
evaporates, and consequently there will be 
the less of it left witli thu juices of the 
meat. 

Brown stock may be m.ide from ox -check, 
shin of beef, ox-tail, brisket or flank of 
beef. 

General Stock-pot. 

209. Stock, in its composition, is not on- 
fined to fresh meat only, any meat or bones 
are useful ; pieces of beef, from any part 
Imm which gravy can be extracted ; bones, 
skin, brisket, or tops of ribs, ox-ciieek. pieces 
of mutton, bacon, ham, and trimmings of 
turkevs, fowls, veal. &c.; and also of bare 
an I pheasant, if they are old and fit for no 
other purpose ; in fact, anything that will 
b'_'C(tme a jelly, will assist in making stock ; 
to this medley of ingredients add carrots 
cut into slice's, herbs, onions, pcjiper, salt, 
spice, &e. ; and when all have stewed until 
the stock is of a rich consistency, take it 
fn)m the fire and pour it out to cool. When 
cold, all the fat must be taken off, and it 
must be poured clear from the sediment. 
When the soup is required to be very rich, 
the jelly from a cow-heel, or a lump of 
butter rolled in flour, must be added to the 
stock. 

The stock-pot should never be suffered to 



be empty, ai ftlmost any meats (save s.ilt 
meats) or fowls make stock . the remn.ants 
should never br thrown anywhere but into 
the stock-pot. and should too much stock 
be alre.idy in your possession, boil it dowa 
to a gUue ; w.ulc is thus avoided. 

Cheap Stock.

beef dripping and an ounce and a half of 
butter, a pint basinful of raw potatoes sliced,

thick, thin it with a little fresh milk ; boil 
all together again ; season it with a spoonful 
of sugar, pepper, salt, and Cayenne to your 
taste. Send it up very hot, with some fried 
bread served separately, cut into very small 
dice.

FISH SAUCES. 

A well made sauce is, perhaps, one of the 
best testimonies of the skill of the cook, and 
ir. a ven.' essential T-art of a good dinner. A 
badly made saute will spoil the food with 
which it is served, ard is a sure sign of in- 
efticiency and ignorance in both tlie cook 
and her mistress. 



Sauces are expensive, and a housewife 
who studies economy, and has only small 
means, will not use as many nor as varied 
forms, perhaps, of the same sauc^. as the 
cook in a wealthy family ; but it is econo- 
mical to be able to serve up a sauce winch, 
at a trifling expense, will greatly improve a 
dinner made, perhaps, Irom cold remains,

and for fish, sauce cf some kind is absolutely 
required. 

The sauce peculiar to the English house- 
keeper IS Melted Butter ; and yet, common 
as it is, we scarcely ever find it well made. 
Now, every lady should know experimentally 
how to make it, that she may direct her cook. 
She should also know experimentally how 
to make Bread Sauce and common White 
and Brown Sauce, on which most other 
sauces are founded. Take care that your 
sauces are delicately flavoured ; if your cook 
is not first-rate, tiiste them yourself. This 
is quite possible, even immediately before 
you receive your guests or sit down to your 
family dinner, as .<;auces must be made be- 
fore the fish is dressed, and kept warm till 
required in a bain-marie— or, if your kitchen 
does not possess that most useful utensil, 
the saucepan in which tliey have been made 
should be placed in a large stewpan of boil- 
ing water near the fire. 

The thickest saucepins should be used for 
this operation, and only wooden spoons 
should be used for stirring. Remember, 
also, that your saucepan must be exquisitely 
clean and fresh if you would have your sauce 
a success, especially when it is melted 
butter. Let your fire be clear and not too 
fieice.

quickly round while you pour in the butter 
Put the mixture into the saucepan again, and 
shake It over the fire for a minute, but do 
not let tt botl ; then squeeze a little lemon 
juice into it, taking care no pips from the 
iruit fall -nto your sauce, as they pive a 
bitter flavour. 

Common Egg Sauce.

piece of butter ; one ounce of sugar ; a little 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg.

the juice through a cloth ; boil half a pint 
of green gooseberries, drain them from the 
water, and rub them through a sieve. Put

French Marinade for Flavoaring Fisli 
before cooking. 

281. Pepper and salt ; three cloves; three 
slices of onion ; a sprig of sweet basil ; a 
teaspoonful of lemon juice or vinegar. 

A good French marinade for flavouring 
fish before cooking is to sprinkle over the 
fish, laid out on a dish, the pepper, salt, 
spice in fine powder, three cloves, the slices 
of onion, the basil minced fine, and a tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice, or a little vinegar. 
After a few hours the fish may be taken 
from this marinade, and either fried, boiled, 
or stewed. The marinade may be used in 
the cooking, or for sauce at pleasure. 

A marinade of oil and sweet herbs minced 
fine is excellent for fish before frying or broil- 
ing. When taken from the marinade, it 
can be either floured or covered with bread- 
crumbs and beaten egg. A squeeze of 
lemon juice or similar pleasant acid, so per- 
ceptible in French cookery, is well worth our 
imitation. 

French White Caper Sauce. 
Time, four minutes. 

282. A piece of batter the size of an egg ; 
a little flour ; a teacupful of broth ; salt ; 
white pepper; a spoonful of capers; one

To make the French white caper sauce, 
rub down a piece of butter, as large as an 
egg, in flour, put it in a saucepan over the 
fire, mix in carefully a teacupful of broth, 
with salt, white pepper, and the capers. Put 
in also an onion or a scallion or two ; let it 
thicken, stirring it over the fire. Take out 
the onions or scallions, and serve the sauce, 
either poured over the turbot or other fish, 
or in a tureen. 

Lobster Sance. 
Time, ten minutes.

MADE GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 

Plain joints roasted make their own gravy 
except perhaps lamb. Made gravies and 
sauces are necessary for more elaborate, and 
less homely cooking. 

Two kinds of gravies are made— i.e., 
brown and white. We shall give receipts 
first for these, which are required for mak- 
ing nearly all the other more complicated 
gravies and sauces, premising that beef is 
the foundation of brown or savoury gravies 
and veal or fowls that of the white and 
more delicate gravy ; but as you may not 
always possess gravy beef at the time you 
want to make your gravy, it will be as well 
to tell you that any kind of stock will do • 
the trimmings of beef, veal, or mutton, and 
the bones of cold joints of meat, or uncooked 
bones, will all afford materials for it. 

Place these, whatever they may be, in a 
stewpan, lay the beef at the bottom, then 
the mutton, with a slice or two of bacon or 
ham, and any bones you have, broken up 
small ; add a few slices of carrot, an onion, 
a blade of mace, two or three cloves, a little 
black and white pepper, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, and lay over them any small pieces 
of veal you may have. Cover the stewpan 
close, and set it over a slow fire for si.\ or 
seven minutes, shaking the pan often. Then 
dredge in a little flour, and pour in water 
till the wholo is rather more than covered. 
Cover the stewpan close, and let it simmer 
for several hours until your gravy be rich 
and good ; then season it to your taste with 
a little salt, and strain it off, and you will 
have a gravy that wyi answer for ordinary 
purposes. Or you can make a good gravy 
from a melt, a kidney, the skirts of beef, 
the knuckle of dressed mutton, or any other 
meat cut into small pieces, and fried a nice 
brown, with onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
and spices. The water in which meat has 
been boiled, used instead of pure water, 
improves and adds to the richness of gravy! 
A cowheel, also, will yield a good gravy 
stock, Soalt it for about twelve hours in 
cold water, and then boil it for about two 
hours and a half or three hour.";. When 
strained and quite cold, take the fat off with 
great care. 

Truflles and morels thicken and improve 
the tiavom- of gravies or soups ; about 
half a-i ounce of either being simmered in 
a pint of water, and .nddcd to the gravy, 
but in ail cases the proportions used, arid 
their quality, should be attended to, as tho

flavour of any pravy or sauce should be 
aflnpted skilfully to the dishes for which it 
is rnqiiiied. 

Wiiite meats, and all 7vkile made dishes, 
require a smooth, delicately flavoured gravy 
or sauce ; brown made dishes, a more pi- 
quant and savoury one. 

Do not let any separate flavour predomi- 
nate in your gravy ; the different materials 
should linrmoniso completely with each 
other, and blend into one perft:ct whole. 

Some cooks make their gravy by first 
boiling a rich, but small quantity oi" stock 
to a glaze, and then pouring slowly over it 
a suflicient quantity of boiling stock or broth 
for the gravy. Flavour it with a few sweet 
herbs, mushrooms, &c., &c. 

Both Tarragon and knotted marjoram 
greatly improve the flavour of gravies. 

Directions for making colouring for soup 
have already been given ; the same may be 
used for gravies. 

Glaze. 

Time, till it becomes a jelly. 

292. Boil some very strong clear gravy or 
jelly over a quick fire to the thickness of 
cream, stirring it constantly until it will ad- 
here jike jelly to the spoon. It must then 
be immediately poured out of the stewpan ; 
the greatest care is required during the time 
of thickening to prevent it from burning. 
When required for use, dissolve it by pla- 
cing the jar (or whatever it may be kept in) 
in boiling water, and brushing it over the 
meat two or three times, when it will form 
a clear varnish. Any kind of very rich 
stock can be boiled down to a glaze. To be 
used for hams, tongues, &c. 

To Browu Flour. 
Time, five minutes. 

293. Put some flour in a pan cr dish, and 
set it in the oven or over the fire. Stir it 
about that it may not burn ; but let it brown 
well. Keep it in a dredging-bo.x for brown- 
ing ordinary gravies. 

A Cheap Gravy. 
Time, half an hour. 

294. Three-quarters of a pound of shin 
or giavy beef ; a slice of onion ; one carrot ; 
n few i^avoury herbs; a little Cayenne and 
salt; a quarter of a pound of butter; one 
pint of water. 

Put the p ece of butter into a small stew- 
pan, with the carrot and onion cut into 
slices, and the meat into dice. Stir it over 
a quick fire until it is lightly browned ; then 
add the herbs and the water, and let it all

TRUFFLES. 
The truffle is a species of mushroom fun- 
gus without roots. It is found m Hamp- 
shire. Wiltshire, and Kent, and is of a good 
size in our own country, though not so large 
^ftl- Italian truffle is. In the New Forest 
'truffles are frequently rooted up from beneath 
the Riant oak-trees which "came m with 
thelonqueror," by the hogs, who (true 
epicures) sre extravagantly fgnd of them. 



In France they form an article of con-^ider- 
able traffic, and have often been purchased 
at fabulous prices for the royal table. I hey 
are very expensive, and chiefly used for gar. 
nishings and seasoning. , ^ „ . 

Good truffles have a plcisant flavour, and 
arc light and elastic. Bad truffles have a 
musty smell. They ought to lie eaten quite 
fresh, as their flavour is a good deal injured 
by drying for keeping 



To Prepare Truffles an Naturel. 
Time, one hour. 
0117. Wash them several times in luke- 
wann water and brush them carefully all the 
time to remove every particle of earth or 
grit from them. Then wrap each truffle in 
buttered paper, and bake them in a hot oven 
—or (better still) roast them in hot ashes for 
an hour. Take off the paper, wipe the 
truffles, and serve them on a hot table- 
napkin, or use them for garnishing. 

Season fur Drying Herbs for Flavouring. 

Basil is fit for drying about the middle of 
I August. , , _ , 

Chervil in May, June, and July. 

Elder-flowers, May, June, and July.

Summer Savory, end of July and August. 

Tarragon, June, July, and August. 

Thyme, end of July and August. 

Winter Savoury, end of July .and August 

They must be gathered on a dry day. and 
cleaned and dried immediately by the heat 
of a stove or Dutch oven, the leaves picked 
off, sifted, and bottled. 

Crisped Parsley. 

018 Pick some handsome sprigs of curled 
parsley, wash them well, dip them into cold 
water throw them into a pan of boiling fat. 
and t^ke them out as soon as they are crisp 

It should be done after the fish, &c.. it is 
to go with is ready, and drained from the 
grease before the fire for a minute or two 

^^ A f^-' bct°ter"plan is to spread the parsley 
after picked and washed, in a Dutch 

oven, .. on a sheet of pa,. . at a moderate 
distance from the fire, and keep turning it 
? m'"= n,-itc ri!='^ • lay little nieces of butter 
on S."bSr noreAough to niake it greasy

1 10 Modes of Fresh Dressing Tongues. — Pressed Beef, &c» 



m 



To Roast a Fresh Tongue. 

rime, to boil, two liours and a half ; to 
roast, half an hour. 

387. The tongue ; twenty-four cloves ; 
a quarter of a jiound of butter ; about six 
ounces of bread-crumbs ; two cggi. 

Socjk the tongue till it has thoroughly dis- 
goigcd in lui<ewarni water, for about ten or 
twelve hours, 'riim and scape it, siick it 
over with the cloves, and boil it slowlv for 
two or (if laigc) three hours. Tlien take it 
lip and brush it over with the yolks of tiie 
egg^, spiiukle it with bread-crumbs. Run a 
long iron skewer through it and roast it of a 
nice brown, basting it constantly with but- 
ter. Tut it on a hot dish, and pour round it 
half a pint of good gravy, with a glass of 
wine. Serve it with red currant jelly. 



To Boil Eeindeer Tongues. 

Time, two hours to simmer. 
388. The proper way to prepare reindeer 
tongues for boiling, is to soak them in a pan 
of cold water for three hours, and then ex- 
pose them to the air ; this must be repeated 
three times. Then scrape them very clean, 
put them info a stewpan of cold water, and 
bring them gradually to a boil. Let them 
simmer slowly, skimming them carefully all 
the time. Serve them on a table-napkin. 

Ox-cheek Cheese,— A Homely American 
Eeceipt. 

Time, four hours. 

389. Half an ox-head ; one teaspoonful of 
fine salt; half a teaspoonful of pepper; one 
tablcspoonful of powdered thyme ; enough 
water to cover the head. 

Split an ox-head in two, take out the eyes, 
crack the side bones, and lay it in water for 
one whole night. Then put it in a saucepan 
with sufficient water to cover it. Let it boil 
very gently, skimming it carefully. When 
the meat loosens from the bones take it from 
the water with a skimmer, and put it hito a 
bowl. Take out every particle of bone, 
chop the meat very fine, and season it with 
a teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful 
of pepper; add a tablcspoonful of powdered 
tliyrne. Tie it in a cloth and press it with a 
Mxight. When cold, it may be cut in slices 
for dinner or supper. The gravy remaining 
will make a rich broth if a few vegetables be 
stewed in it. 

Pressed Peef. 

Time, five hours, 

390. I'en or eleven pounds of the flank ; 



two pounds of salt; half a pound of moist 
sugar; a quarter of an ounce of saltpetre. 

'Jake about ten or eleven pounds of the 
thin flank, and rub well into every part two 
pounds of salt, and half a pound of moist 
sugar mixed with the saltpetre dissolved, 
repeat the rubbing with the pickle every day 
for a week ; and then roll it round and bind 
it with a wide piece of tape. Ifave ready a 
stewpan of scalding water, put in the beef, 
and when it simmers allow five hours for ten 
pounds of meat. When sufficiently done, 
drain off the water in which it was boiled, 
and pour cold spring water over it for six 
or eight minutes, drain it on a sieve reversed, 
and then place it on a board with a weight 
on it to press the meat well. Then remove 
the tapes, trim it neatly, and serve it when 
required. 

Beef to Eat Cold. 

Time, to pickle, twelve days ; to stew, seven 
or eight hours ; to piess', twelve hours. 

391. Six or seven pounds of the brisket of 
beet ; one ounce of bay salt ; half an ounce 
of sal prunella ; two ounces of coarse brown 
sugar; half a teaspooniul of mixed spices. 

'lake six or seven pounds of the brisket of 
beef, put it into a small earthen pan, and 
! rub it well with common salt for four days, 
turning and rubbing it every morning. Then 
salt it with tiie above ingredients, mi.xed and 
pounded ; let it remain for tight days, rub- 
bing and turning it daily, that it may im- 
bibe the pickle. Before setting it on the 
fire to stew, strew over it and insert between 
the flaps half a teaspoonful of mixed spice. 
Put it in a cloth, and boil it gently for six or 
seven hours. Then take out the bone, wrap 
it tightly in a cloth, and put it between two 
boards with a heavy weight placed upon it 
for twelve hours. This beef, when cold, is 
very good for breakfast or luncheon. 

Collared Beef. 
Time, half an hour to the pound. 

392. Six and a half or seven pounds of 
the thin end of the flank of beef; pickle 
made of one ounce of saltpetre ; six of salt ; 
a little coarse sugar (about two ounces) : 
three ounces of powdered herbs. 

Let the beef remain in this pickle for ten ' 
days, turning and rubbing it daily. Bone it 
and remove the skin, gristle. &c. Sprinkle 
it with powdered herbs, and season it highly 
with salt and pepi)er. Roll it up in the 
shape of a brawn, or fillet of veal, and bind 
it firmly with a broad tape ; wrap a cloth 
round it, and boil it gently. When it is done, 
put It under a heavy weight (without loosen-

Beef Liver for Gravy. 
Time, twenty-four hours. 
-04 The liver must be first hung up to 
drf-n '; after that salt it well and leave it 
twenty-four hours in a dish. Then hang it 
UP to drain, and when it has ceased dripping 
hang it in a dry place for use. It is excel- 
lent'for gravy to cutlets and all made dishes. 



Broiled Steak. 
Time, eight to ten minutes. 
oqs. Rumpsteak ; one ounce of butter ; 
one tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup ; 

pepper and salt. .... , , • 

Rumpsteak is best for broiling and frying; 
beefsteak for stewing. 

Take care that the butcher cuts the steak 
the right thickness—*./?., about three-ouar- 
ters or half an inch. Divide it in halves. 
Place the gridiron over a clear fire, and rub 
the bars with suet to prevent the meat from 
adhering to them. Place the two steaks on 
it and broil them, turning them frequently 
with the steak tongs, or if with a fork, care- 
fullv pricking it through th( fat. If the 
steak itself is pricked, the gravy will run out 
and it will harden. Have ready a hot dish 
on which you have placed a lump of butter 
the size of a large walnut, a tablespoonful of 
mushroom ketchup, and a little salt and 
pepper. Lay the steaks (rubbing them 
lightly over with butter) on the dish, and 
serve as quickly as possible. 



vent it fro'ni burning ; when one side is well 
done, turn it on the other with your mcat- 
torvgs— if you do not possess a pair, turn it 
witii a fork, but take care not to stick tlio 
fork into the juicy part of the stake, put it 
in the fat or in the edge of the meat. When 
the steak is done, lay it on a hot dish, with 
I a little made gravy, or a lump of butter and 
la tablespoonful of ketchup. Season with 
popper and salt. Tomato sauce is some- 
times eaten with beefsteak. 

Fried Onions and Rumpsteak. 
Time, twenty minutes. 

398. A rumpsteak ; three onions ; a good- 
sized piece of butter ; and a little salt.

into a hot dish with a good-sized piece of 
butter on the top ; or pour the fat from the 
pan, put in a little water, shake it about, let 
it just boil, and pour it over tlie steak. Have 
ready the onions, cut into thin rings, and 
again divided across ; fry them lightly, and 
when done drain them on a colander belore 
the fire, stirring in a little salt. Serve them 
in a separate dish, as the flavour of onions 
is often disliked.

bread-crumbs, and a seasoning of pepper 
and salt to taste. Put a layer over the boned 
meat, roll it round, and tie it securely. Boil 
it very slowly for nearly two hours, remove 
the siring, and pour over it a little well-made 
caper sauce, the remainder of which must 
be served separately. 

BAKINO 

Is not a good or economical way of cooking 
joints of mutton, but it is sometimes done 
on account of its convenience. 

A joint to be baked is [uit on a trivet or 
stand in a baking dish, sometimes with po- 
tatoes under it, which are so savoury thus 
dressed that they partly reconcile us to the 
sodden taste of meat dressed in a common 
oven. A shoulder of mutton is, we believe, 
the only one thus dressed. To do it nicely, 
cover it with two sheets of buttered paper— 
or they may be greased with dripping — to 
keep it from being dried up. Put potatoes 
under it with a little water on gravy over 
them, and a little salt. The kT.at should be 
occasionally basted while bakmg. 

Breast of Mutton Grilled. 
Time, one hour and a half. 

" 430. A breast of mutton ; yolk of one 
egg ; some bread-crumbs ; a bunch of sweet 
herbs ; a sprig of parsley ; one onion ; four 
pickled cucumbers ; a tablespoonful of 
capers ; half a pint of gravy ; a piece of but- 
ter rolled in flour. 

Half boil a breast of mutton, score it, and 
season it with pepper and salt, rub it over 
with the yolk of an e^g, and sprinkle it with 
bread-crumbs and sweet herbs chopped fine. 
Put it over a clear fire, and broil it gently 
till it is of a fine brown colour, or set it be- 
fore the fire in a Dutch oven and do the 
same ; chop a sprig of parsley, an onion, 
four pickled cucumbers, and a spoonful of 
capers, boil them five minutes in half a pint 
of gravy, thicken it with a piece of butter 
rolled in flour, lay the mutton on a hot dish 
and pour the sauce over it. 

Stewed Loin of Mutton, 
Time, two hours and three-quarters. 

431. A loin of mutton ; one ounce and a 
half of butter ; one shallot; a bunch of swett 
herbs ; four dessertspoonfuls of the best 
vinegar ; rather more than a pint of water ; 
and a glass and a half of port wine.

fully, and roll the mutton, securing it with 
skewers. Put it into a stewpan with a bunch

minutes, thicken the gravy with a little but- 
ter rolled vn (lour, and pour i . over the meat 
when sent to table. 

The ex;: ct quantities of water and season- 
ing must be regulated by the size of the 
joint, a? 5ome necks of mutton weigh six or 
seven pounds, in which case an extra half 
hour must be allowed for it to simmer. 

Breast of Mutton and Green Peas. 
Time, two hours and a half. 

' 433. A breast of mutton ; one quart of 
greeii peas ; a bunch of sweet herbs ; pep- 
per and salt to taste ; one shallot or onion.

meat, skim off all the fat from the gravy, 
and strain it over the meat into the stewpan, 
and make the whole very hot. Just before 
serving add a quart of young green peas,

House lamb is in season in December. 
Grass lamb comes in at Easter. Lnmb 
should be very well dressed. It is best when 
only two months old. The foic-quarler 
should be dressed very fresh ; the hmd- 
quarter should hang. 

Roast Fore-Quarter of Lamb. 

Time, for ten pounds, two hours and a 
half. 

449. Cut off the scrag from the shoulder, 
saw off the shank bone, and also the chine 
bone along the fillet of the leg, and joint it 
thoroughly ; partially saw the rib bones, and 
break the bone of the shoulder, twist it round, 
and fasten it with a skewer from beneath 
the breast. Cover the lamb with buttered 
paper, and spit it evenly, roast it before a 
quick fire according to the weight. Just 
before removing it from the spit, dredge it 
with flour and a little salt, and baste it with 
butter to make it froth up. Twist a cut 
paper round the shank bone, place it on a 
hot dish, and pour round it a little gravy 
made in the dripping-pan. Serve it witli 
mint sauce in a tureen. A cut lemon, some 
Cayenne, and a piece of fresh butter should 
always be ready for use when the shoulder 
is separated from the ribs, to be laid between 
it and them. 

Boned Quarter of Iamb- 
Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound. 

450. One pound of forcemeat ; melted 
Iwttcr. .

Time, one hour and a quarter, or according 

to weight, 

451, A little butter, flour, and salt.

not separated. The flap bones must be 
taken from the neck, the chine bone sawed 
off, and the ribs well chopped. Cover it 
with buttered paper, place it ill an even 



I position on the spit, and roast it before .1 
' bright fire for an hour and a quarter. )ust 
before it is taken up, dredge it with a little 
salt and flour, and baste it well with butter 
to make it look brown, .and froth it up. 
Then dish it up, and place the gravy made 
in the dripping-pan round it. Serve it with 
mint sauce in a tureen. 



Roast Leg of Iamb. 

Time, one hour and three-quarters for six 

pounds. 

452. Procure a fine fresh leg of lamb, 
and place it some distance from the fire,

done, move it nearer, dredge it with flour 
and a little salt, and baste it with dissolved 
butter, to give it a nice frothy appearance. 
Then empty the dripping-pan of its con- 
tents, pour in a cupful of hot water, stir it 
well round, and pour the gravy over the 
meat, through a fine sieve. Serve with 
mint sauce and a salad. 

Roast Shoulder of Lamb. 
Time, one hour and a quarter. 

453. Place the joint at a moderate dis- 
tance from a nice clear fire, and keep it con- 
stantly basted, to prevent the .skin from 
becoming burnt. When done, dish it up ; 
and serve it with gravy made in the drip- 
ping-pan and poured round it. Send up 
mint sauce in a tureen. 

Roast Loin of Lamb- 
Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound. 

454. The loin is seldom roas^-^d, on 
account of its small weight, but for lamilies 
of two ladies or a single person it will be 
found very delicate. Care must be taken 
that it does not burn in roasting. It is best 
to cover it with a buttered paper and remove 
it a few minutes before serving, to baste and 
froth it. Mint sauce. 

Saddle of Lamb. 

Time, a quarter of an hour to the pound ; 

one hour and a half to two hours.

LainFs Fry, — Lamb Cutlets. — Lamb Chops, 



Thoroughly clean a lamb's head, and 
pnrboil it, then brush it over with the yolks 
of the eggs well beaten; chop a few sweet 
herbs very fine, mix them with bread- 
crumbs and a little warmed butter, and 
spread the mixture thickly over the head, 
then put it into a Dutch oven before a 
bright and clear fire to finish dressing. 
Mince the liver and the heart very small, 
and let them stew until done, pour in three- 
quarters of a pint of good gravy, with a 
spoonful of lemon pickle, or the juice of a 
lemon, make the brains into small cakes 
with a little milk and seasoning, and fry 
them brown. Piace the head in the centre 
of the dish on the minced liver and heart, 
and garnish with brain cakes, forcemeat 
balls, and a lemon cut into slices and placed 
at the edge of the dish. 

Lamb's Fry. 
Time, altogether twenty minutes. 

462. One pound of lamb's fry ; one egg ; 
one ounce of bread-crumbs ; a sprig of 
parsley ; pepper and salt. 

Take a pound of lamb's fry, and boil it 
for about a quarter of an hour ; then drain 
it dry. Brush it over with the yolk ol a 
beaten ^g'g, and then cover it with bread- 
crumbs, seasoned with minced parsley, 
pepper, and salt. Fry it till it is a nice 
colour — i.e., for about five minutes— and 
serve it on a folded napkin with fried 
parsley. 

Cold lamb is so excellent that it is often 
pre'cnrd to hot-diesscd joints. It is quite 
a mistake to prepare it by any of the moiles 
of d'cssipg up cold meat. It should be 
eaten with mint sauce and a nicely-made 
salad. 

Lamb Cutlets and Green Peas. 
Time, eight or ten minutes. 

463. Two, or two and a half pounds of 
the best end of a neck of lamb ; bread- 
crumbs ; two eggs; pepper and salt; two 
ounces of butter ; half a peck of green 
peas. 

Take the cutlets from the best end of the 
neck ; chop off the thick part of the chine 
bone, and trim the cutlets neatly In taking 
off the skin and the greater part of the fat, 
scraping the upper part of the bones per- 
fectly clean, Brush each cutlet over with 



well-beaten yolk of egg, and then sprinkle 
them with fine bread-crumbs, seasoned with 
pepper and salt. After this dip them sepa- 
rately into a little clarified butter. .Sprinkle 
more crumbs over tiieni and fry them, turn- 
ing them occasionally. Have ready half a 
peck of green peas, nicely boiled, and ar- 
ranged in a pyramid or raised form in the 
centre of a hot dish. 1 .ay the cutlets before 
the fire to dr.-iin, and then place chem round 
the green peas. 

Lamb Cutlets S, la Royal, 
Time, ten or twelve minutes. 

464. A loin of lamb ; pepper ; salt ; nut- 
meg ; one egg ; one ounce of bread-crumbs ; 
a sprig of jiarsley ; a dessertspoonful of 
flour ; a cupful of boiling water ; one 
lemon ; a piece of butter. 

Cut a sufficient number of cutlets from a 
loin of lamb ; season them with pepper, 
salt, .nnd grated nutmeg. Dip each cutlet 
into the yolk of a well-beaten egg, strew 
bread-crumbs over each, and fry tliem all 
nicely in butter, or in beef dripping. When 
done, arrange them in the form of a crov.n 
on the dish ; make a sauce of two ounces of 
butter placed in the pan seasoned with a 
little pepper and a sprig of chopped paisley, 
or a lemon sliced thin and just browned ; 
dredge into the sauce a dessertspoonful of 
flour, and stir it smooth ; put in a cupful of 
boiling water, and stir it well together over 
the fire for a few minutes ; pour this sauce 
inside the crown of cutlets, and serve. Or, 
when the cutlets are fried, drain them ; 
place them on a dish in a crown ; glaze 
them, and serve with stewed peas or spinach 
in the centre, instead of the above sauce. 



Lamb Chops. 
Time, eight to ten minutes. 

465. Chops from the loin ; pepper and 
salt ; a n ould of mashed potatoes. 

Cut the chops from a loin of lamb ; let 
them be about three-quarters of an inch 
thick. Broil them over a clear fire. When 
they are done, season them with pepper 
and salt. Have ready a mould of nicely 
mashed potatoes in a hot dish ; place the 
chops leaning against them, and serve very 
hot. Or they may be served garnished only 
with fried parsley.

VEAL. 



Veal should be obtained from a calf of 
about two or three months old, if it is re- 
quired nice and delicate. Bull-calf veal is 
best fc cooking in joints ; cow-calf veal for 
mndc dishes. 

The failing of this meat is its tendency to 
turn ; should it show symptoms of doini; so, 
put it into scalding water, and let it boil for 
seven minutes with some pieces of charcoal 
or sprinkled with charcoal powder, 'lake it 
out of the pot, plunge it in cold water, and 
put it into the coolest spot you can find. 

The skirt should always be removed from 
the breast, and tlie pipe from the loin in hot 
weather, as soon as it comes from the but- 
cher's. 

Veal supplies numerous enln'cs or made 
dishes. 

The fillet derives much of its pleasant 
flavour from being stuffed ; veal in itself 
being nearly tasteless. The stufling should 
be placed in the hollow place from whence 
the bone is extracted, and the joint should 
be roasted a beautiful brown ; it should be 
»;ooked gradually, as the meat being solid, 
will require to be thoroughly done through, 
without burning the outside ; like pork, it 
is rather indigestible. Boiled bacon or ham 
should accom[)any it to table, with the addi- 
tion of a lemon cut in halves and handed to 
the guests. 

In roasting veal, care must be taken that 
it is not at first placed too near the fire ; the 
fat of a loin, one of the most delicate joints 
of veal, should be covered with greased 
paper ; a fillet also shouUl iiave on the caul 
until nearly done enough ; when almost 
done, dredge with flour, and produce a fine 
froth. In grand kitchens, or where cream 
is abundant, cooks occasionally baste veal 
with it for about fifteen or twenty minutes 
before serving. 

To Roast a Fillet of Veal. 

i 

Time, four liours for twelve pounds. 

466. Veal ; half a pint of melted butter ; 
a lemon ; half a pound of forcemeat. 

Take out the bone of t!ie joint, ana with 
a sharp knife make a deep incision between 
the fillet and the udder. Fill it with the 
forcemeat or veal stuffing. Bind the veal 
up in a round form, and fasten it securely 
with skewers and twine. Run the spit as 
nearly through the middle as you can ; 
cover the veal with buttered paper, and put 
it at some distance from the fire at first, 
advancing it as it becomes dressed. Baste 



it well, and just bcforf» it is done, take off 
the paper, died£;e a little flour over it, and 
baste it well with butter to give it a fine 
frothy appearance. Romovo the skewers, 
and replace tlu-m witli a silver one ; pour 
o%'er the fillet some melted butter, with the 
juice of half a lemon and a little of the brown 
gravy from the meat. Garnish with slices of 
cut lemon, and serve with either boiled ham, 
bacon, or pickled pork. 

Fricandcau of Veal. 
Time, two hours and a half or three hours. 

467. Three or four pounds of the fillet of 
veal ; a few slices of bacon ; a bunch of sa- 
voury herbs; two bicides of niace ; two bay- 
leaves ; five allspice ; one head of celery ; 
one carrot ; one turnip ; lardoons ; pepper 
to taste ; one pint of gravy or stock. 

Cut a thick handsome slice from a fillet 
of veal, trim it neatly round, and lard it 
thickly* with fat bacon. Cut the carrot, 
turnip, and celery into slices, and put them 
into a stew|:ian with a bunch of savourjf 
herbs, two blades of mace, five allspice, 
and two bay-leaves, with some slices of 
bacon at the top. Lay the fricandeau over 
the bacon with the larded side uppermost, 
dust a little salt over it, and pour round it a 
pint of good gravy or broth. Tlace it over 
the fire, and let it boil, then let it simmer 
very gently for two hours and a half or 
three hours over a slow fire, basting it fre- 
quently with the gravy. Take out the frie.ui- 
deau when done ; skim otY the fat, strain 
the gravy, and boil it quickly to a strong 
glaze, co\er the fricandeau with it, ancl 
serve it up very hot, upon a purde of green 
peas. Be careful that the gravy docs not 
touch the fricandcau, but that it only covers 
the bacon and other ingredients at the bot- 
tom of the dish. 



Fricandeaox of Veal 
Time, two hours to two hours and a half. 

468. Some slices of veal ; a quart of good 
gravy ; a slice of lemon ; a spoonful of 
anchovy ; two dessertspoonfuls of lemon 
pickle ; two of browning ; a little Cayenne 
pepper ; a few shreds of bacon. 

Cut some steaks from the thick part of a 
fillet of veal about half an inch thick ancj 
six or seven inches long, lard them neatly

with slircds of fat bacon, and drodtro tlicm 
with flour. Rrown them in a Dnti Ii oven 
before the fire, and then put them into a 
stewpan witli the gravy, and let them stew 
half an hour. Add a slice of lemon, a little 
anchovy, lemon pickle, browning, and Ca- 
yenne pepper. When the fricandeaux are 
tender take them up, strain and skim the 
gravy, boil it to a glaze, and pour it over 
the fricandeaux, or thicken it with a piece of 
butter rolled in flour. Serve them with sor- 
rel sauce, and garnish with forcemeat balls, 
or the yolks of liard-boilcd eggs. 

CALF'S HEAD. 

A calfs head may be bought ready for 
cooking fron; the butcher's, but as it is as 
well to givf directions for tlie cook in all 
possible circumstances, we will soy here 
that if she has a calf's head to prepare with 
the hair on ?t, she must have ready a pan of 
scalding ■iVater to remove it. She will find 
the hair easier to get off if she powders it 
with resin afrer letting it soak a little while 
in warm watt r. She must then plunge it 
into the scalding water, holding it by the 
eaj, and carefully scrape off all the hair. 
Many cooks \ise scalding water only, but 
M. Soyer (whose name is a perfect authority) 
recommends the resin, and it certainly faci- 
litates the operation, though it is riot indis- 
pensable. Then take out the eyes, saw the 
head in halves lengthways through the skull. 
Take the b.ain and tongue out. Half a 
calf's head is generally enough to serve at 
one time, but a whole head is a very hand- 
some dish. Break the jawbone, remove the 
gums containing the teeth, and then lay the 
head in a large panful of warm water to 
disgorge. 

Calf s Read Boiled. 

Time, to soak, one hour and a half ; to 
simmer, one hour and a half. 

469. Half a calf's head ; half a pint of 
melted butter with parsley ; one lemon ; a 
pinch of pepper and salt. 

Soak the half calf's head in cold water for 
an hour and a half, then for ten minutes in 
hot water before it is dressed. 

Put it into a saucepan with plenty of cold 
water (enough for the head to swim), and 
let it boil gently. When the scimi rises 
skim it very carefully. After the head boils, 
let it simmer gently an hour and a half. 
Serve it with melted butter and parsley over 
it, and g.irnish with slices of lemon and tiny 
heaps of fried parsley. Hain should be 
scived with culrs head, or slices of bacon. 



. Or : a Savoury Calfs Head. 

470. When the head is boiled, score it on 
the surface, beat up the yolk of an egg, and 
rub it over the cheek with a feather. Pow. 
der it with some finely-powdered lemon 
thyme and parsley, pepper and salt, and 
bread-crumbs. Brown it with a salamander 
or in a Dutch oven, and when it begins to 
dry, .sprinkle a little melted butter over it. 

Garnish with rasliers of bacon curled 
round it. 

Save some of the liquor in which the calfs 
head is boiled for a hash the next day.

a knife, soak thera in cold water with a little 
salt in it for an hour ; then pour away tiie 
cold water .ind cover them with hot water ; 
clean and skin them. Boil them then very 
gently in half a pint of water, take off the 
scum carefully as it rises. Take them up, 
drain and chop them, and put them to warm 
in a stewpan with the herbs chopped, the 
melted butter or cream, and the seasoning. 
Squeeze a little lemon juice over them ; stir 
them well together. Boil the tongue ; skin 
it ; take off the roots ; lay it in the middle 
of the dish, and serve the brains round it. 

Hashed Calfs Head. 
Time, one hour and a half. 

472. Half a calf's head ; a bunch of sa- 
voury herbs ; two blades of mace ; a little

calfs head, into small round pieces of about 
two inches across. Put a quart of broth or 
the liquor in which the head waS boiled into 
a stewpan with a carrot, one small onion, 
two blades of mace, and a bunch of savoury 
herbs, and boil it until reduced to nearly 
half the quantity ; then strain it through a 
hair sieve, and add a glass and a half of

PORK. 



Veiy great care should be used in pur- 
chasing pork, as of late years pigs have been 
suh-ect to mucn disease, and the flesh of the 
animal then becomes perfectly poisoi-ous. 
If possible, learn where and how t!ie pork 
you cat is fattened. 

A pig is one of the most profitable ani- 
mals to keep, and will well repay any care 
and attention bestowed on it. Every part 
of it is used and is good for food. It should 
be kept scrupulously clean, the sty carefully 
cleaned out very often, and the pig washed 
and scrubbed itself. Its food should be 
always cooked for it. Skim milk, potatoes, 
and meat are its best food. 

A pig should only be six months old for 
boiling or roasting, larger and older, of 
course, for salting. A pig should be short- 
legged and thick-necked, and have a small 
head. 

A pig should not be suffered 10 touch food 



for twenty-four hours before it is killed. 
Ilam, bacon, pickled pork, &c.. &c., are 
indispensable in an English kitchen, but 
fresh pork is seldom served in joints at the 
tables of the upper classes. Eoi family use, 
however, and where people keep their own 
pigs, the leg and loin of pork are often seen. 
As many pcisons are unable to digest fresh 
pork, it is seldom or never part of the bill 
of fare for a dinner party. 

Modern taste is adverse to the old savoury 
stufling of sage and onions, bu^ this also 
is admissible at the family repast if liked. 

The skin of young porkers is kept on 
when it is cooked, and is called "crack- 
ling," beuig very crisp aiul brown, and 
making a crackling noise when cut. 

Pork must be very much more dressed 

than all other meats, except veal. It 

should, therelore, be placed on the spit at a 

i considerable distance horn the tire, and thus

To Roast Sucking Pig, ^c. 



let get well warmed tlirougli before the skin 
begins to get dry and brown. 

Sucking Pig— to Scald it. 

488. A sucking pig should be dressed the 
day after it is killed, if possible, and should 
not be more than three weeks or a month 
old. The pig is generally sent from the 
butcher's prepared for the spit, but in case 
our readers should ever have occasion to 
scald and clean it for themselves, wc will 
give a few directions :— Make ready a large 
pan of scalding water. While the water is 
boiling, put the pig into cold water for fen 
minutes ; plunge it into the boiling water 
(holding it by the head), and shake it about 
till the hairs begin to loosen in the water, 
'lake it out dry it, and with a coarse cloth 
rub the hairs backwards till they are all 
removed. When it is clean, cut it open, 
take out the entrails, and wash it thoroughly 
in a large pan of cold water. Dry it Tn a 
cloth ; remove the feet at the first joint 
leaving a little skin to pull over the bone' 
Fold it in a very wet cloth until you are 
ready to put it on the spit. 



To make Sage and Onion Stuffing for 

Roast Pig or Roast Pork. 

Time, twenty-five to thirty minutes. 

489. Two large onions ; double the quan- 
tity of bread-crumbs ; three teaspoonfuls of 
chopped sage; two ounces of butter; half 
a saltspoonful of pepper; one saltspoonful 
of salt; one ^gg. 

Boil the onions (unless they are Portugal 
onions) in two or three waters to take off 
the strong taste in them ; then drain them 
chop them up fine, and mi.v them witli 
double their quantity of bread- crumbs three 
very full teaspoonfuls of minced sage two 
ounces of butter, a good half saltspoonful 
of pepper, and double the quantity of salt 
Mi.x the whole with the well beaten yolk of 
an egg to bind it. 

_ N.B.— Persons who prefer a strong stufif- 
mg can use half the quantity of bread- 
crumbs, and chop the onions raw. 



To Roast the Pig. 

Time, one hour and a half to two hours. 

490. Haifa pint of melted butter; two 
ounces of fresh butter; three-quarters of a 
pmt or one pint of sage and onion force- 
meat. 

When the pig is well cleaned, make a 
forcemeat according to previous directions, 
or a vea! stufiing forcemeat if preferred' 
feew U up with a strong thread ; truss it as a 



hare js trussed, with its fore-legs skewered 
back and its hind legs forward. Dry it well 
and rub it with a httle flour. Set it before 
a clear brisk fire, arrange under it a dripping 
pan and basins to catch the gravy. Baste 
it with a little pure olive oil. or with its own 
gravy, rubbing it occasionally (when you do i 
not use oil) with butter. When it is done 
cut off the head, split it in halves, divide tli,i 
pig with a very sharp knife down the centiv 
lay the backs together, put the cars on each 

side, and the halves of the head at each end 

of the dish. Pour a little of the gravy of ! 

the pig, mixed with thin melted butter and 

a squeeze of lemon juice, over it. 
Send some of the same gravy and melted 

butter (seasoned with a little Cayenne) to 

table in a sauce tureen. 
Sauces to be eaten with it— bread sauce 

or tomato sauce, or apple sauce, as pre' 

ferrcd. y 

To Bake a Pig. 
Time, two hours. 
491. Wash the pig very nicely, rub it with 
butter, and flour it all over. Well butter 
the dish in which you intend to bake it. and 
put it into the oven. Whf;n sufficiently 
done, lake it out, rub it well over with a 
buttered cloth, and put it in again to dry. 
When It is finished cut off the head, and 
split it open ; divide the pig down the back 
in halves. Lay it in the dish back to back 
with one half of the head at each end, and 
one of the ears on each side. Take off the 
fat from the dish it was baked in, and you 
will find some good gravy remaining at the 
bottom. Add to this a little veal gravy 
with a piece of butter rolled in flour and 
boil It up, put it into the dish over the pi? 
and serve. * * 

A stuffing of bread-crumbs, chopped sage 
leaves, pepper and salt, should be put into 
the inside before it is baked, as is done for 
roast pig. 

CHINE OF PORK. 



This joint is usually sent to table with 
turkey. It .should be salted for about sixty 
or seventy hours previous to cooking, and 
then be roasted. A chine is as often sent to 
table boiled as roasted, but the latter is usu- 
ally preferred. In roasting pork, the skin 
shoulf" be cut lengthways into small stni):*, 
but not deep enough to reach the meat. 

Chine Roasted. 

Time twenty minutes to the pound. 

492. Half a pint of pork stuffing; half a 
pint of apple sauce.

weigh more than six or seven pounds 
Score the rind or skin with a sharp knife all 
round the joint, place it at some distance 
from the fire, turn it constantly and baste it

To Roast a Leg of Pork the Old Fashioned 
Way with Stuffing. 

Time, twenty minutes for each pound. 

496. Sage and onion stuffing ; a piece of 
butter. , 

Select a fine small leg of pork, keep the 
skin on, and score it in regular stripes of a 



quarter of an inch wide witli the point of a 
^.harp knife ; cut a slit in the knuckle, raisu 
the skin, put under it sonu; nice sagi! and 
onion stuffing, and fasten it in with a small 
skewer ; put it at sonu; distance from tiie 
fire, and haste it ficquently. Just before it 
is done, moisten tiie skin all over with a 
little butter, drcdt^e it with flour, and place 
it near the fire to brown and crisp. When

made in the dripping pan round it, and 
serve witli apple s.iace. 

To Roast a Loin of Pork. 
Time, two hours and a half. 
497. Take a loin of pork of about five 
pounds, and score it with a very sharp knife 
at equal distances, place it at a good dis- 
t.ince from tlie fire to prevent the skin from 
becoming hard, and ba-.te it very ficfiuently 
all the time. When done make a little gravy 
in the diippin^'-iian. pour it round die meat, 
and serve with apple sauce in a tureen. A

pounds. 
493. Score the skin, put the joint down to 
a bri-^ht fire to roast, rub a little flour over 
it. If the rind is kept on, roast it without 
a buttered paper over it, but it the skin and 
fat are removed, cover it with a buttered 
paper. Keep it frequently basted. About 
ten minutes V)ofore tai;iiig it up. strew over

butter, and serve with gravy strained over it, 
and api)le sauce u\ a tureen. 

Pork Griskin. 
Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound. 
499. A griskin is usu.ally very hard. It is 
well before you roast it to put it into as 
much cold water .as w ill cover it, and let it 
just boil. T'ake it off the moment it boils. 
Rub a piece of butter over it and flour it, 
then set it in a Dutch oven before the fue 
to roast a nice brown. 



To Steam a Ham. 

Time, twenty minutes to each pound.

a time ns llieweitjlit requires, tlic pioportiun 
of timo Riven al)ovc. 

This is by far tlie best way of cookin.sf n 
liam. It prevents waste, and retains the 
flavour. Wlicn it is done, skin it and strew 
brenfl raspinp;s over it as usual. If you pre- 
serve tlie skin as whole as possible and cuvei 
tlie ham when cold with it, it will prevent 
its becoming dry. 

To Soil a Ham. 
Time, four or five hours. 

50T. A blade of mace ; a few cloves ; a 
sprier of thyme ; and two bay leaves. 

Well so;d< the ham in a lar.c;e quantity of 
water for twenty-four hotn-s. "then trim and 
scrape it very clean, put it into a large stew- 
pan with more than sufBcient water to cover 
it ; put in a blade of mace, a few cloves, a 
sprii^j of thyme, and two bay leaves. Boil it 
for four or five hours, accordinsr to its weight; 
and when done, let it become cold in the 
liquor in which it was boiled. Then remove 
the rind carefully without injurinjf the fat, 
press a cloth over it to absorb as much of 
the Rrease as possible, and shake some bread- 
raspinjTS over the fat, or brush it thickly 
over with plaze. Serve it cold, parnished 
with parsley, or aspic jelly in the dish. Or- 
nament the knuckle with a paper frill and 
vegetable flowers. 



Or, to Serve Hot. 

Time, four hours for ten pounds. 

502. Before placing: your ham in sonk, 
raw a small sharj) knile into it close to the 
bone, and if when withdrawn it has a pleasant 
smell, the ham is good. Lay it in cold 
water to soak for tucnty-four hours if it has 
hung long, changing the water twice ; but 
twelve hours is the usual time for a York- 
shire ham. 

Before boiling, wash it thoroughly, and 
trim it neatly, n-moving any rusty' parts. 
Cover it well with water, bring it gradually 
to a boil, tak-'igcare that it continues to do 
so (but not too fast), and as the scum rises 
skim the pot carefully. When it is done 
draw oft the skin, and sift bread-raspings 
over the ham. Place a frill of paper round 
the knuckle, and serve. 

To Bake a Ham, 

Time, four hours. 
503. Take a medium-sized ham, and place 
it to soak for ten or twelve hours. Then cut 
away the rusty part from underneath, wipe 



I It dry, and cover it rn'Iicr thickly over with 
ii paste of flour and water. Tut if nito an 
earlhcn dish, and set it in a ntoderately. 
heated oven for four hours. When donp 
takeoff the crust c.ircfully, and peel off the 
skin, put a frill of cut pajicr round the 
knuckle, and raspings of bread over the (at 
of the haiTi, or serve it glazed and garnished 
with cut vegetables 

Some persons infinitely prefer a baked 
ham to a boiled one, but we think it better 
boiled or steamed. 

To Boil a teg of Pork, 

Time, a quarter of an hour for each pound, 
and half an hour over. 

504. Procure a nice small compact leg of 
pork, rub it well with salt, and let it remain 
for a week in pickle, turning and nibbin" 
the pickle info it once each day. Let it lie 
for Inlf an luur in cold water before it is 
dressed to ;m|)rove the colour ; then put it 
into a large pot, or stewpan, and well cover 
It with wat-r. Let it boil gradually, and 
skun It frequ«rttly as the scum rises. On no 
account let it boil fast, or the meat will be 
hardened, and the knuckle end will be done 
before the thick part. When done, serve it 
on a hot dish with a garnish of turnips, or 
parsnips. A peas-pudding must be served 
with boiled leg of pork and greens as vege- 
tables. It may be boiled in a cloth dredged 
over with flour, which gives it A very delicate 
appearance, but in that case the water in 
which it wiis boiled, cannot be used as a 
stock for pea-soup, and is thus wasted. 

To Choose Bacon. 

505. E.vcellent young bacon may be thus 
known :— the lean will be tender and of a 
bright colour ; the f^xt firm and white yet 
bearing a pale rose tinge, and the rind thin. 
Rusty bacon has yellow strafius in it. 

(r 

To Boil Bacou. 

Time, one hour and a half for two or three 
pounds. 

506. If very salt, soak it in soft water two 
hours b-fore cooking. Put it into a sauce- 
pan with plenty of water, and let it boil 
gently. If a fine piece of the gammon of 
bacon, it may, when done, have the skin, 
as m hams, stripped off, and have finely- 
powdered bread-raspings strewed over it. 

.uaCOu uHu Sg'g'S. 
Time, three quarters of an hour. 

507. A quarter of a pound of streaked 
bacon ; six or seven eggs ; two spoonfuls of 
gravy ; a little pepper and salt.

slioiild be steamed. No ^ astc then takes 
pl.ice as to quantity, and the ilavour is quite 
]iivscrved, while the bacon is much n\ore 
tLMuler. as it caimot well be spoiled by too 
quick boiling. 

Scrape the outer rind or skin well, wash the 
bacon, put it in a steamer over a \m\. of boil- 
iiifj water, and steam it for ;•■■ lung as re- 
qiiiii'd by the weight. Servi' it with veal or 
fowls, or' by itself with greens. 

To Salt Larding Bac^. 

509. Bacon to be used for larding should 
he very firm and fat, and should not be 
cured with saltpetre, the effect of which is to 
rciklen w bite meats. 

Hub the pieces of bar'-n you wish to keep 
for larding with fine salt, lay them, wel', 
salted, one on the other, put a weight on 
tlieai, and leave them for six weeks in pickle, 
then have them smoked quite dry. 

Directions for larding are given in this 
work, but only practice can enable the cook 
to lard nicely. 



Pickled Pork. 

Time, three-quarters of an hour to four 
■ pounds. 

510. The belly p.. it =s considered delicate. 
It should be nice'V i/ -eaked. Boil it gently, 
iierve it with ;?# .j I's a garnish round it. 

A Hand of Pork. 

Time, one hour. 

511. If the pork should be very salt, it 
will require to be soaked for nearly two 
hours before boiling. Boil it, and serve with 
greens, and peas-pudding in a separate dish. 

Pigs' Tongues. 

512. Partially boil the tongues in order to 
^(»j-^^f-»yft thi^ sliin. I^ickle them as vou do 
hams (according to previous receipts); lay 
them one on the top of each other under a 
heavyweight. Cover the pan in which you 
place them, and let them remain for a week, 
then dry them, and put them into sausage 



skins. I'.isten them up nt the ends, and 
smoke them. 

Pig's Tettitoes,

and salt, and .serve u]) \Nith sippets ol plain 
or toasted bread; m.ike a pyr.imid of the 
minced heart and liver, and lay the feet 
round thi'in. When jjcttitoes are fried, 
they should be first boiled, then dipped in 
butter, and fried a light brown. 

Receipts for dressing piqs" feet and cars 
will be found amongst breakfast dishes. 

To Eoast a Pig's Head. 

Time, to roast, half an hour.

Pig's Head Boiled. 

Time, one hour and a half. 

515. This is the more jMofitable dish, 
though not so pleasant to the p.alate ; it 
should fiist be salted, which is usually done 
by the pork butcher ; it should be boiled 
gently ; serve with veget.ibles. 



Pig's Cheek. 

Time, three-quarters of an hour. 

516. Pig's cheek ; one ounce of bread, 
crumbs. Boil and trim in the shape of ham,

VENISON. 



There are three kinds of venison in Great 
Britain. 'I ho red deer, the fallow deer, and 
the roebuck, peculiar to Scotland as the red 
dcor now is to Ireland. 

The flesh of the fallow deer is the best. 
Venison should be dark, finely grained, and 
firm, with a good coating of fat. It requires 
to be well hung in a cold, dry larder. 

Haunch of Venison. 

Time, three to four hours. 

529. Haunch from twenty to twenty-five 
pounds. 

'1 his joint is trimmed by cutting off part I 
of the knuckle and sawing off 'the chine I 
bone, then the flap is folded over, and it is i 
covered with a paste made of flour and 
water. This paste should be about an inch •■ 
thick. Tie it up in strong and very thick ' 
paper, and place it in a cradle spit very close : 
to the fire till the paste is well hardened or i 
crusted, pouring a few ladlcfuls of hot drip. ' 
ping over it occasionally to prevent the 
paper from catching fire. Then move it 
further from the fire, take care that your fire 
is a very good one, clear and strong. Wlien 
the venison has roasted for about four hotii'^ 
take it up, remove the paper and paste, and 
run a thin skewer in to see if it is done 
enough. If the skewer goes in easily it is 
dressed, if not put it down again, as it de- 
pends greatly on {he strength of the fire for 
so large a joint. When it is dressed, glaze 
the top and salamander it. Put a frill round 
the knuckle, and serve veiy hot with strono- 
gravy. Red currant jellv in a glass dish o'r 
a tureen. Vegetables: French beans. 



To Hash VenisoTk 
Time, one hour and a half. 
5'^r- Some cold roast venison ; tlnvc 
tab.espoonfuls of port wine ; a litde mutton 
broth : half of a shallot ; a pinch of Cavenne- 
one ounce and a half of butter ; a spoonfui 
of flour ; and salt to taste. 

Cut some cold venLson into nice slices 

and season them lightly with salt ; put the 

bones, trimmings, any cold gravy from the 

venison, au'l as much broth as you mav 

require into a sfewpan. and let it simmer 

I slowly for qtiite an hour, then strain it off • 

I ^"ll^'?'- butter and flour over the fire until 

sufiinicitly brown to colour the gravy, takintr 

care it does not burn. Pour the gravy froni 

tne bones, add the port wine, and let it 

Simmer until it boils. Tiien draw the stew- 

i^an to the side of the fire, put in the slices 

of venison, and when thoroughly /i^;/ serve it 

"P, with red currant jelly in a glass dish 

Garnish with lorcemeat balls about the size 

01 a marble. 



Neck of Venison. 
Time, a quarter of an hour for a pound. 
530. Cover it with paste and paper as for 
the haunch, fix it on a spit and roast. 



To Broil Venison Stents. 
Time, to broil, fifteen minutes. 

532. Venison steaks ; a piece of butter 
the size of an (^gg to each pound of meat; 
pepper; salt; currant jelly; two table- 
spoonfuls of wine. 

Let the gridiron become hot, rub the bars

onit h.aving first dipped them 'in flour or 
rolled biscuits. Set it over a clear but not 
tierce fire. When one side is done take the 
steak carefully u|) and hold it over the steak 
dish, so that the blood mav fiill into it- then 
turn the other side on the gridiron, nnd let it 
broil nicely. Set the steak dish where it will 
become hot, put on it a piece of butter the 
size of an Mgg for each pound of venison, add 
a saltspoonlul of salt, the same of black 
pepper, and a iittie cunaut jeiiy made liquid

POULTRY. 



In I-ondon poultry is boii.srht Vfady trussed 
from lie poulterer; nevertheless, it often 
hnppens tiiat the cook has turkeys, fowls, 
&c. &c., sent from the country to pick and 
prcpnre herself, and thus a knowledge of 
trussing: is absolutely necessary. 

At the head of the several directions or 
receipts for dressing poultry and game which 
are here offered, there will, therefore, he 
foimd full and ample instructions as to truss- 
ing and preparing the birds. 

It has been thought more convenient for 
the reader of this work, to put both trussing 
and cooking directions on the same page, 
rather than for her to have the trouble of 
turning back for the former to another part 
of the book. The coloured engravings will 
serve to exemplify the verbal teaching, and 
render the art of trussing easy to every com- 
prehension. 

All poultry should be carefully picked : 
every plug or stub removed, and the birds 
carefully singed with a piece of lighted white 
paper. French cooks hold them over a 
flame to remove the down, thinking that 
lighted paper is apt to blacken the skin. 

Poultry should be drawn carefully, taking 
care that the gall bag and the gut joining 
the gizzard are not broken. The liver and 
gizzard will be required under the pinions of 
the bird ; but open the gizzard first and 
remove the contents, and detach the gall 
bladder from the liver. Fowls should be 
drawn through the vent. 

Take care to roast poultiy by a brisk clear 
fire, a slow fire will spoil them. 

The time given with each receipt for 
dressing the birds, nmst be ah\ays under- 
stood with the niodificitions required by the 
different sizes of the same.

Duck, from three-quarters of an hour to 
one hour. 

Ducklings, from twenty-five to thirty-five 
minutes. 

A capon, full size, one hour. 

A goose, one hour and three-quarters ;

Roast Turkey. 
In season from December to February. 
Time, according to size, from one hour and 
fifteen minutes to two hours, or two hours 
and a half. 

534. Half a pint of forcemeat for veal, or 
sausage meat ; a little butter. 

To truss 'he bird : pick the bird carefully, 
and singe off the down with a piece of lighted 
white paper ; break the leg bones close to 
the feet ; hang it on a hook and draw out 
the strings from the thigh ; cut the neck off 
close to the back, but leave the crop skin 
long enough to turn over the back ; remove 
the crop, and with the middle finger loosen 
the liver and the gut at the throat end. Cut 
off the vent, remove the gut, take a crooked 
wire and pull out the gizzard, at.d the liver 
will easily follow. But be very careful not 
to break the gall bladder ; if you do it will 
spoil the flavour of the bird entirely, by 
giving it a bitter taste, which no after'eftort 
of washing, ilc. can remove. Do not bre.ik 
the gut joining the gizzard either, test the 
inside should become gritty. Wipe Iha 
inside /r/-/<'f//i/ clean with a wet cloth, then 
cut the breast bone througli on each side 
close to the back, and draw the legs close 
to the crop. Put a cloth on the breast, and

Tiien run a lone; skewer into i\v. pinion and 
fliigli through tl-.e body, pn'.->;:-.g it tlirough 
the opposite pinion and thigh. On the 
other side put a skewer in die small part of 
the leg, close on the outside of the sidesman, 
and push it through. Clean the liver and 
gizzard and tuck them between the pinions, 
and turn the point of the pinions on the 
back. Pass a string over the points of the 
skewers, and tie it securely at the back to 
keep the bird neat and firmlv trussed. Cover 
the breast with a sheet of nicely buttered 
\vhii(! paper. 

Place the bird on the spit'or roasting jack, 
and set it at some distance from the fire, 
which should be a very good and bright one, 
Acep the heat well to~ the breast. Put a 
quarter of a pound of butter in the dripping- 
pari, and ba'^te it frequently to prevent it from 
drying too much. Just before it is finished 
dressing, remove the paper, dredge it lightly 
with flour, and baste it with the butter, 
so as to brown and froth it. Serve it with 
good brown gravy poured over it, and gar- 
nish with small fried sausngcs or forceiiieat

hundred of rhestnnls till lender; remove the 
shell; peel them and chop them very fnie. 
Take tli^ marrow of two marrow bones, cut 
it into pieces and stuff the inside of the 
turkey with the marrow and chestnuts. Fix 
a buttered paper over the breast ; put it 
down to a good fire, and baste it constantly 
all the time it is roasting. Then take oft the 
paper, baste the turkey well with butter, 
sprinkle a little salt over it, and dredge it 
with flour to froth it. When done, take it 
up, pour over it a little chestnut sauce, and 
serve it with brown gravy separately. It will 
take a quarter of an hour longer roasting 
than when dressed without the marrow and 
chestnuts. 

Sauce : bread sauce. 

Boiled Turkey. 
Hen turkeys arc best fjr boiling ; they 
should hang quite four davi before they 
are dressed. 



Time, large turkey, one hour and three- 
quarters ; smaller, one hour and a half. 
536. To truss a boiled turkey. 
Cut the first joint of the i;--gs off, pass the 
middle finger into the inside, r,.ke the skin 
of the legs, and put them under die apron 
of the bird. 

Put a skewer into the joint of the wing 
and the middle joint of the leg, and run \\. 
through the body and the other leg and 
wing. The liver and gizzard must be put 
in the pinions. Then turn the small end of 
the pinion on the back, and tie a packthread 
over the ends of the legs to keep them in 
their i^laces. Having trussed the turkey for 
boiling, pnt it, wrapped in a clean cloth, 
into sufficient hot water to more than cover 
it. Bring it gradually to a boil, and care- 
fully remove the scum as it rises, or it will 
spoil the appearance of the bird. Let it 
simmer very gently for an hour and a half, 
or for a longer time if of a large size. When 
done, serve it on a hot dish, with a little 
celery sauce, oyster sauce, or with parsley 
and butter ; put a small quantity of either 
over it, and send the otiier up in a tureen 
separately.

a cupful of cream ; a piece of butter the size 
of a walnut well rolled in tlour. 

Choose a fine hen turkey, stuff it with veal 
stuffing, .and truss it as for boiling. Put it 
into a large stewpan filled with water, and 
let it boil until tender. Take up the turkey 
with .sufficient of the water in which it has 
been boiled to keep it hot. Wash the celery 
■ uul put it into a stewpan with the other por- 
tion of the water in which the turkey w.is 
boiled, and let it stew until tender, which

If you have birds which you fear will not 
keep, pick and empty them ; rinse tliem, 
and rub them over witli s.ilt outside and in ; 
have in readiness a kettle of boiling w.ater 
and plunge them in one by one, liokhng 
them bv the legs and drawing them up and 
down, so that the water may pa' s through 
them, let them remain in it for l.ve or si:; 
minutes, then hang them in a cfol pi. ice ; 
when perfectly drained, rub tin m ontsidi; 
and inside with black pepper, or bettor still, 
lightly powder them with charccal. The 
! niost delicate bird', may be preserved in this 
' way. Thoroughly wa>,h them before roast- 
! ing or otherwise cooking tliem. 
i Pieces of charcoal put about meat or 
birds will preserve them from taint, and 
' restore thom when spoilt. Poultry or game 
drawn and wiped dry, and a kiuib of char- 
coal put into the body and powdered over 
the outside of each, will keep them nicely. 
or they may be kept in an ice safe. Pepper 
secures them from Hies.

MADE DISHES, ENTREES, &c., &c. 



" In the hands i f an expert cook," says 
Majendie, "alimentary substances are made 
almost to change their nature, form, con- 
sistence, odour, savour, colour, chemical 
composition, &e. ; everything is so modified 
that it is often impossible for the most c.\- 
ciuisite sense of taste to recognise the sub- 
stance which makes up the basis of certain 

dishes." , , ,. u 

This is rspeci.ally true of made dishes. 
There is a good old story of a French gen- 
tleman lavi°ig a bet with an epicure triend 
of his that he would not detect the basis of 
a niado disli which liis took should prepare. 



The bet was accepted— and lost ! The 
basis of the dish being a pair of old white 
kid gloves. So runs the legend in honour 
of good cookery which cm make the most 
intr.ictable substances tender by skill and 
care. Made dishes require dof/t to be eat- 
able and nice-looking ; a gre.isy, badly- 
fl.avoured dish is an insult to those to whom 
it is offered. It is far better to send up 
meat or fish in its plainest form rvcU done, 
. K— than to scrv some of the messes occa- 
triend sioiiallv pie[)aied by bad cooks - ai wh;c!i

proclominnting flavour strong enough to be 
unplcn^nnt. 

Ilnwcvcr, it is rossil)lo to prcpnrc made 
dishes nicely. If a lady has only an in- 
forior cook, she should see to Ihcir prepara- 
tion herself, as a delicate palate is required, 
or an experienced one, for judging of fla- 
vours and seasoning. 

■ In the receipts we are about to offer, the 
iimc must be considered as capable of being 
slightly modified by the degree of heat of 
either the- fire or liot stove to which the 
preparation is subjected. Pepper and salt 
should be used with caution. Sover advi.sed 
sprinklijis; them in from the lingers, not 
throwing them in from the spoon. 

'I'he genius of a cook is shown in made 
dishes ; his taste, in preparing them for the 
eye as well as for the palate. All made 
dibhes should be served as hot as possible.

MEAT PIES AND PUDDINGS. 



We bpli<"ve that it is utterly impossible to 
tearh verbally how to make good paste or 
pie-trust ; a k'f^son from a good cook would 
be worth whole volumes on this subject. 
Some general directions, however, may be 
given on this important art. I'irst, the cook 
should have smooth cold hands— very clean 
_((ir making paste or crust. She should 
wiiNh them well, and plunge them in cold 
water for a minute or two in hot weather be- 
fore beginning her paste, drying them well 
alterwaids. 

1 he pastry slab, if possible, should be 
made ot marble ; if it is a wooden paste- 
board, it sriould lie kept scrupulously clean. 
'Ihe crust used for homely pies need not 
be as delicate as that used for company ; it 
mav be made of clarified beef dripping or 
lard instead of butter. 

lie very careful about the proper heat of 
the oven tor baking pies, as if it be too cold 
the paste will be heavy, and have aduU look; 
if too hot, the crust will burn before the pie 
is done. 

'I'rv it the oven is hot enough by holding 
your hand mside it for a few seconds ; if you 
can do so with' "t snatching it out again 
quicklv, it is too cold, it is best, iiowever, 
»" try It by baking a little piece of the crust 
!;i !'. fust. 

A iv.-vs make a small hole with a knife at 
tl'.f tOjj r( the pie to allow the gases gene- 
rated in it by the cooking to escape. This 
aperture is also useful lor pouring gravy into 
the pie when it is done, if more is recjuired. 
The liand of a pastrycook should bt; light, 
and the paste should not be worked more 
than is absolutely required for nv.xmg it. 

We gi\e first three plain receipts for pie- 
crust, such as people of small means can 
use, and will find good— a puff paste (by 
Soyer), and one which will be found gcjod 
enough for all ordinary purposes, of butt<T, 
flour and egg, the last made stifl— will also 
suit raisi'l pies. 

Webcijiii by giving instructions for clari- 
fying dripping, so as to render it fit for 
making pie-crusts. 

To Clarify Beef Dripping 

703. Put the dripping into a basin, pour 
over it some boiling water, and stir it round 
with silvei' spoon ; set it to coo), and then 
re' 'he dripping from the sedioient, and 
put II .ato basins or jars for use in a cool 
place. (Jl.Tined dripi^ing may be used for 
frying atul bastin'j evervthmg except game 
or puultiy, as well us fur ptes. &c. 



To Make a Short Crust with Dripping - 
Ko. 1. 

704. One pound of flour ; threr-quartirs 
ofai)onn(i of clarified beef dripping; one 
wineglassful of very cold water ; a pinch of 
salt.- 

'lako care that the water you use is colil. 
especially in summer. I'ut the flour, wi'.l 
dried, intcj a large basin (which should be 
kept for Ihe purpose) with a pinch of salt ; 
break up the claiihed beef dripping into 
pieces, and mix them wr//wilh the flour, 
rubbing them together till they are > Ime 
[H)W(ler. Then make a hole in the nnddlir 
of '.he flour, and pour in water enough to 
make a smooih and flexible paste. Sprinkle 
the pasteboard with flour, and your hands 
also, take out the lump of paste, roll it out. 
fold it together again, and roll it out ; fold 
it again, and roll it out— /.<•., roll it three 
times ; the last time it should be of the thick- 
ness required for yo'.ir crust, that is, about a 
quarter of an inch, or even thinner. It is 
then ready for use. 

Or, a still Plainer Crust fbr Children- 
No. 2. 

705. One pound of flour ; five or six 
ounces of clarified beef dripping ; and a cup- 
ful of water. 

I'ut the flour into a bowl, and work it into 
a smooth paste with about a cupful of water. 
Divide the clarified dripping into three parts, 
roll out the paste, and put over it, in rows, 
one portion of the dripping b.oken into 
pieces the size of a bean ; flour it, fold over 
the edges, and again roll it ; repe.it this fold- 
ing, spreading, and rolling three times, 
dredging a very litil • flour over the i)a.s;e 
and rolling-pin each time. It will be hi for 
any common purpose, or for children. 

Or, Dripping Cmst-No. 3. 

706. One pound of flour ; five or six ounces 
of good bvef dripping ; a large pinch of 
salt ; one egg ; water to moisten. 

Put the flour into a bowl and work into 

I it five or six ounces of good lieef drijipi. g 

I until as fine as the flour, add a pinchi f sail, 

I and mix the whole into a paste with ono 

beaten egg and inough cold water; roll it 

out thin, and use it lor meat pies, &c. If 

for friit or jam tarts add an ounce and a 

half of sifted loaf sugar. 

To Make Plain Cmst with Lard - No. 4. 

707. One pound of flour; three- quarters 
Of a pound qf lard ; a pinch of salt.

164 Modes of Making Plain Crusts and Puff Paste. 



Rub fi little of the lard into the flour in 
the; basin, a pinch of salt, and moisten it 
with water till it is a stiff paste ; take it 
out, lay it on tlit' floured pasteboard, flour 
the roller, and roll it out. Lay small knobs 
of lard dented into the paste in alternate 
rows all over th<; flat surface, then flour it, 
and fold over the ed^cs all round till they 
meet in the centre; turn the roll of paste 
over, and roll it out again ; repeat the 
spreading alternate rows of lard, flour it, 
and fold up the edges again. Roll it out 
a third time, spread the knobs of lard, flour 
it, fold it, and roll it out to the thickness 
required. 

A Lir-ht Puff Paste-No. 6. 

708. One pound of flour ; half a pound 
of butter ; half a poiuid of lard ; water to 
moisten it ; a pinch of salt. 

Rub a little of the flour into the basin with 
a pinch of salt, then rub in a few knobs of 
butter ; put in the salt ; add water enough 
to make it into a stiff paste, then flour the 
pasteboard and your hands. Take out the 
paste, flour the roller, and roll it out to a 
thin flat surface. Spread over it in alternate 
rows knobs of butter and lard, fold it over 
from the edges, and let it stand in a very 
cool place for half an hour. Then roll it out 
agaii), sprinkle a little flour over it, and add 
another layer of alternate knobs of butter 
and lard. Let it stand for ten minutes. 
Roll and butter it twice, without letting it 
stand between the two List times. Roll it 
thinner for mince pies, which this crust suits 
very well. 

Common Puff Paste— Americau. 



Benton Paff Paste. 

710. Five ounces of beef dripping to one 
pound of flour, mi.xcd with hot water, but 
not boiling. Put together lightly on the 
paste-board with a knife, and with the hands 
only to finish off. If the quantity makis 
more than is required it will keep well for 
two or three days. Tiie great secret m 
making pastry well is to nux it lightly and 
make us quickly as possible. 

Puff Paste- Very Good. 

711. A quarter of a pound of butter; 
half a pound of lard ; half a pound of flour; 
a little salt ; ail to be chopped up together 
and mi.xed with told water till a proper 
stiffness, roil it out, and in making, use a 
knife, and not the hand. Make it in a cold 
place. 

Suet Crust for PuddUgs. 

7T2, One pound of flour ; >i.< ounces of 
beef suet ; a cupful of cold w ater, 

Strip the .skin from the suet, chop it as 
fine as possible, rub it well into the flour, 
mi.x it with a knife, work it to a very smooth 
paste with a cupful of water, and roll it out 
for use. 

Common Crust for Baised PIm. 

713. Two pounds and a half of flour; 
three-quarters of a pint of water ; four 
ounces of butter ; four ounces of lard ; 
half a saltspoonful of .salt. 

Put two pounds and a half of fine flour 
01. the pasteboard, and put into a stewpan 
three-quarters of a pint of water witr. the 
above proportions of butter and lard. When 
the water boils, make a hole in the middle 



of the flour, pour in the water, butter, and 
709, One pound of sifted flour; a quarter i '^."'f ^y degrees, gently mixing the whole 
of a pound of lard ; half a teaspooniul of 
salt ; half a pound of butter. 




Put one pound of sifted flour on the slab, 
or in an earthen basin, make a hollow in the 
centre, work into it a quarter 01 a pound of 
lard and half a teaspoonful of salt. When it 
is mixed through the Hour, add as much cold 
water as will bind it together, then strew a 
little flour over the pasteboard or table; 
flour the rolling-pin, and roll out the paste 
to half an inch in thickness ; divide half a 
pound of butter in three parts ; spread one 
evenly over the paste, fold it up, dredge a 
little flour over it and the paste-slab or table; ' 

roll it out again, spread another portion of cut 'fronj the' middle of the fish, pick out 
the butter over, and fold and roll again ; so ; the flesh of a boiled lobster, chop up the 
continu* until all the butter is used ; roll it ' solid parts, and mix al' well with liquefied 
out to a quarter of an inch in thickness for [ butter, season to taste, put on a crust, and 
uafr I bake it fur about one hour. 



with a wooden spoon. When it is well 
mixed, knead it with your hands till it be- 
comes stiff, dredging with a little flour to 
prevent it sticking to the board. When 
thoroughly kneaded, put it into a pan, cover 
it over with a cloth, and set it before the 
fire for five or six minutes, when it will be 
fit for any home purposes.

Moisten the remainder of the lobster with 
this, and lav it at the bottom of the bowl, 
cut up the lettuce, take care that it is well 
rolled over in the dressing, and put it over 
the lobster. Mustard can be left out if it is 
not liked. The above quantity is given for 
the proportions, and can be increased accord- 
ing to the lobster employed.

half a pint of salad oil ; half a pint of \..ie- 
gar; two tablespoonfuls of made mustard; 
Cayenne pepper; and salt; three lettuces; 
a sprig or two of mint; half a rbot of beet. 

To make the dressing, beat three new-laid 
eggs thoroughly, and mix in gradually half 
a pint of salad oil, beat in half a pint of 
vinegar or less, two tablespoonfuls of made 
mustard, Cayenne pepper and salt. Wash 
three fine white lettuces, and drain them dry, 
cut them up with the meat of two large 
lobsters, or of four smaller (which is better) 
adding a sprig or two of mint if the flavour 
be not disliked. Cut up also three hard- 
boiled eggs, and dice abcut half a root of 
beet. A deep dish is prettier to use than a 
salad bowl. Mix all the ingredients wi'll

Time, to boil tlie artichokes, half an hoMr ; 

ten or twelve minutes to boil the eggs. 

1438. Six artichokes ; three hard-boiled 
cgRs ; a little good gravy, or melted butter. 

Strip the leaves from six artichokes, and 
boil the bottoms in hard water until suffi- 
ciently done. Boil tluve eggs for ten or 
twelve minutes. Cut them across, and place 
on each artichoke half .-n egg, leaving the 
round end uppermost. Put tliem on a hot 
dish, and pour over them a little good 
melted butter, or some rich gravy. 

Frothed Egga. 
Time, to brown, five minutes. 

1439. Eight eggs ; one tablespoonful of 
water ; a pinch of salt ; juice of one lemon ; 
sugar to taste ; vanilla or lemon ilavouring ; 
one pound of sugar. 

Beat the yolks of eight and tho whites of 
four eg,n;s witii a spoonful of water, a \i\x\c\\ 
of salt, the juice of one lemon, and sugar to 
taste. Fry them as an omelet, and put it 
on a dish. Have ready the four remaining 
whites whipped to a high froth with a pound 
of white pounded sugar and a flavouring of 
vanilla or lemon ; heap it on the omelet very 
high, and sot it before the fire, or in the 
oven, for a few minutes to lightly brown. 

Toasted Cheese. 
Time, about ten minutes. 

1440. Cut some Parmesan or Cheddar 
cheese into very thin slices or shreds. Put 
it into a tin toasting dish, and set in the 
oven, or before a stronj,- fire to toast, and 
when thoroughly dissolved, stir into it a 
good-sized piece of butter, a spoonful of 
made mustard, and a little very fine pepper, 
and serve it in a dish as hot as possible witn 
pulled bread, or placed on toast. 

Welsh Rahbit. 
Time, ten minutes to brown. 

1441. A quarter of a pound of Cheshire 
or Parmesan cheese ; yolks of two eggs ; 
five ounces of grated bread ; a quarter of a 
poun'l of butter ; one tablespoonful of mus- 
tard ; a little salt.

cheese five ounces of bread-crumbs and a 
quarter of a pound of good butter ; add a 



tablespoonful of mustard and a little «i.ilt 
Mix all well together, and then beat ii 
smooth m a mortar. Lay the mi.xture 
neatly on slices of toasted bread, antl place 
them in a Dutch oven before the fire to bt. 
come thoroughly hot and slightly brown 
Placing a thick white paper over the disli 
until iiot, and then removing it prevents the 
cheese from becoming too brown or dry. 

Mayonnaise de Saumon. 

Time, to boil the eggs, twenty minutes. 

1442. One pound aiid a half c*" cold sal- 
mou ; small sal.ad of endive and .mustard 
and cress ; one teaspoonful of chopped tar-

Wash and carefully clean the salad and 
lettuces, shred the latter up fine. Cut part 
of the salmon into small pieces, boil the 
eggs quite hard. Make .some Mavonnaise 
or tartare sauce. Put the salad 'into the 
bowl, mix a little of the salmon with it, and 
add the sauce. Cut some rather longer 
pieces of salmon, season them with oil 
vuiegar, pepper, and salt. Pile the salad uo 
m the middle, lay the pieces of salmon upoli 
it. 

Mock Crab. 

1443- Three-quarters of a pound of 
pickled shrimps ; a quarter of a pound of 
good mellow cheese ; a spoonful of made 
mustard ; a little salad oil ; two .spoonfuls

heat of .summer, when our buffer threatens 
to become oil, a few lumps of ice placed 
round and on the pot (if no refrigerator is 
possessed by the housewife), will render it 
good and eatable at a very slight expense. 

And, if the outlay of a few pounds can 
be afforded, we recommend every house- 
keeper to purchase one of the new " Piston" 
Freezing Machines, invented by Mr. Ash. 
The lowest price will be only £2 lor. for 
one to be used wiUi ice and salt only, 
iiiese pretty little machines can be uccd by 
a lady herself with the greatest eai;e. The 



writer has assisted iti the manufac'iire of nn 
ice with one, and found it a pliMsant and 
amusing task, and at a very sni.dl expense 
iced creams, puddings, &.<:., iiic, can bo 
produced wheiievtr required. 

The Piston Freezing Machines may be 
had either to be used with ice and salt only, 
or it may be used with the chemical free/,, 
inj" mi.vture. The latter, however, is ex- 
pensive. 

There is a new icinnj machine recently 
patented which is said ij be likely to sur- 
pass tlioic named hcic. 



Beceipts for Making Ices. 
Nesselrodo, or Frozen Pudding. 



1445. Take one pint of cream, half a pint 
of milk, the yolks of four eggs, one ounce 
of sweet almonds pounded, and half a pound 
of sugar. Put them in a stewpan on a 
gentle fire ; set it as thin as custard. Wlien 
cold, freeze, and when sufficiently congealed 
add one pound of preserved fruits, and two 
wineglasses ol brandy, with a few currants. 
Cut the fruit small, and mi.x well with the 
ice. Let it remain to set in the moulding 
pots, as directed. 

Custard Ice Cream. 

Ijj46. Take a pint of fresh cream, add the 
yolks of six new-laid eggs, stir them up well 
with a wlii.sk, add a thin slice of lemon peel 
as for custard. Put the pan on a gentle fire, 
or in hot water, stirring it until the cream 
appears to be setting, remove it from the 
fire, and add pulverized sugar to palate. 
Place it in a vessel of cold water, and con- 
tinue stirring a few minutes to prevent its 
curdling. Give it any flavour you please, 
strain it through a sieve, then put it into the 
freezer, and proceed as before directed. 
One quart. 

Strawberry Ice Cream. 

1447. Pick some strawberries (the scarlets 
are considered the best) into a basin or pan, 
add sugar in powder, with a quantity of

of a lemon or two, according to palate, a 
small quantity of new milk, and a pint of 
fresh cream. Mix and add a little colour, 
from cochineal, saffron or spinach juice ; 
freeze. One quart. Or, when fresh straw- 
berries cannot be procured, take one pound 
of strawberry jam, the juice of one or two 
lemons, one pint of cream, and a little 
milk. Colour ; freeze. One quart. * 

* Should the cream be found not to freeze so 
quickly as you wish, add a little more new milk, 
ihis applies to all ice rreams.

To Clarify Sugar for Ices. ! 

1456. Take twelve pounds of su,c;ar, twelve 
pints of water, half the white of one egg;, 
well b .'aten up ; add to it the water ; boil 
ten minutes. This is used in all water ices. 

Clai'et Cap. 

1457. To each bottle of claret add one of 
soda-water, a glass of sherry or cura9oa, the 
peel of a lemon cut thin, and powdered 
sugar to taste. Add some lumps of ice, and 
let it remain half an hour before serving. A 
few slices of raw cucumber or some sprigs 
of burridge may be added. I 

Instead of the lemon peel as above, a pint I 
of ripe raspberries or four or five peaches or \ 
nectarines, cut in slices, will make a most 
delicious beverage. 

Moselle Cup. 
i4;8. To each bottle of still or sparkling 
Moselle add one of soda-water, a glass of 
siierry or brandy, four or five thin slices of 
pineapple, the peel of half a lemon cut thin, 
powdered sugar to taste, and some lumps of 
block ice. A pint of strawberries or some 



peaches or nectarines may be used instead 
of pineapple. 

To Moulil Dessert Ice when not Frozen in 
the Patent Moulding Pots. 

1459. Dessert ices, iced puddings, &c 
when required to be moulded, must not be 
frozen too hard, or they will not fill the cre- 
vices of the mould. 

After the mould is filled with the dessert 
ice. secure it air-tight by placing a piece of 
writing paper round the edges, and then 
shutting the top and bottom cover of the 
mould upon it. 

The mould should be immediately in- 
serted into a tub of rough ice and salt, seein," 
! thai every part of the mould is well covered^ 
and in contact with the ice and salt. In 
about an hour, or longer, if convenient, the 
mould may be withdrawn, and the ice turned 
out and sent to table. 

AH dessert ices and puddings should con- 
tain only a certain amount of sweetness ; 
the proper richness is shown by using a sac- 
charometer. For ascertaming the correct 
amount of saccharine (or sweetness) that 
should be contained in dessert ices, iced pud- 
dings, &c., when using either iceand common 
salt, or the chemical freezing powders, as a re- . 
frigerating medium, use the saccharometer. 

Directions for its Use. 

1460. Nearly fill a tumbler with the sweet 
confection ; place the saccharometer gently 
into it, and if mixed correctly, for freezing 
with ice and salt, it will sink to the lowest red 
mark. For freezing with freezing powders 
It will sink to the highest red mark. To 
make the saccharometer sink, add milk to a 
cream ice, and water to a water ice. To make 
it rise, add more sugar or sweet syrup. 

Ices, &c., will not freeze well unless mixed 
by this scale. 



BAKING BISCUITS AND CAKES. 



An oven to bake well should have a re- 
gular heat throughout, but particularly at 
the bottom, without which bread or cakes 
will not rise, or bake well. 

An earthen basin is best for beating eggs, 
or cake mixture. 

Cake should be beaten with .a wooden 
spoon, or spatula ; butter may be beaten 
with the same. 

Eggs should be beaten with rods, or a 
broad fork ; a silver fork, or one made of 
iron wire, is best, as it is broadest ; eggs 
should ije clear and I'resh for a cake. 

It is well, as a general rule in cake making. 



to beat the butter and sugar (which must be 
made fine) to a light cream ; indeed, in the 
making of pound cake, the lightness of the 
cake depends as much upon this as upon 
the eggs being well beaten ; then beat the 
eggs and put them to the butter, and gradu- 
ally add the flour and other ingredients 
beating it all the time. 

In common cakes, where only a few eggs 
are used, beat them until you can take a 
spoonful up clear from strings. 

In leceinrs in which milk is ir-cd as one 
ingredient, either sweet or sour may be used 
but not a mixture of both, '

Sour milk makes a .'^pongy light cake;

pound cake. 

'lo blanch almonds, pour boiling water 
on them, and let tiiem remain in it until the 
skins may be taken off; then throw the 
almonds into cold water to whiten them, 
drain them from the water, but do not wipe 
them ; the moisture will prevent their oiling. 

In making cakes, if you wish them to be 
pleasing to the palate, use double refined 
sugar, although light brown sugar makes a 
very good cake. 

For icing cakes, the sugar must be rolled 
and sifted, or pounded in a mortar. 

For making lady-tingers, have a tin tube 
as long as your finr , like the spout of a 
funnel ; to the u]jpe\ . rt of this a little bag 
must be attached, and the cake mi.xture put 
in, and pressed out on to the paper the 
length and size desired ; the point of the 
tube Uiay be larger or smaller as may be re- 
quired. Savoy biscuit mi.xtm-e may be baked 
as lady-fingers for making Charlotte Russe. 

To ascertain whether a cake is baked 
enough, if a small one, take a very fine 
splint of wood and run it through the 
thickest part; if not done enough, some of 
the dough, or unbaked cake will be found 
sticking to it; if done, it will come out clean. 
If the cake is large, pass a small knife-blade 
through it instead of the splint. Cakes to be 
kept fresh should be placed in a tin-bo.x 
tightly covered, in a cool dark place. 

Preparation of Sugars. 

T461. To prepare sugars properly is a 
material point in the business of confec- 
tionery; and as some riales are undoubtedly 
necessary to be given in a work of this kind, 
we shall begin with the first process, that of 
clarifying sugar, which must be done in this 
manner : — 

Break the white of an egg into the pre- 
serving-pan, put in four quarts of water, and 
t)eat it up to a froth with a whisk. 'I'hen 
put in twelve pounds of sugar, mix all to- 
getlier, set it over the fire, and when it boils, 
put in a little cold water. Proceed in this 
manner as many times as may be necessary 
till the scum appears thick on the top ; then 
remove it from the fire, and let it settle; take 
off the scum, and pass it through a strain- 
ing bag. If the sugar should not appear 
very fine, you must boil it again before you 
strain it, otherwise, in boiling to a height, it 
will rise over the pan. Having thus finished 
the first operation, proceed to clarify the 
sugar to either of the five following degrees. 

J'irst JDegree, called Smooth or Candy 
Sugar. 

1462. Having clarified the sugar as above 



directed, put any quantity over the fire, and 

let it boil till it is smooth. This may be 
known by dipping the skimmer into the 
sugar, and then touching it between the fore- 
finger and thumb (previously dipped into 
cold water) and immediately opening thnn; 
a small thread v.ill be drawn between, which 
will instantly break, and remain as a drop 
on the thumb. This will be a sign of its 
being in some degree smooth. Then boil it 
again, and it will draw into a l.irger string, 
and will have acquired the first deijrec above 
mentioned. 

Second Degree, called Souffle. 

1463. To obtain tlii- degree, boil the sugar 
longer than in the former process, and then 
dip in the skimmer, shaking olf the sugar 
into the pan. Then with the mouth bluw 
strongly through the holes, and if certain 
bladders or bui)bles blow through, it will be 
a proof of its having acquired the second 
degree. 

Third Degree, called Feathered Sugar. 

1464. This degree is to be proveii by dip- 
ping the skimmer in wlien the sug;ir has 
boiled longer than in .he former degree. 
First shake it over t! j pan, then give it a 
sudden I'irt behind, and if it is boiled enough, 
the sugar will fly ^^^ ''1^^ feathers. 

Fourth Degree, called Crackled Sugar. 

1465. I Living let the sugar boil longer 
than in the pieeeding degree, dip a slick 
into the sugar, and iminediately put it into 
a basin of iced water. Draw off the sugar 
that hangs to the stick into the water, and 
if it becomes hard, and snaps in the water, 
it has acquired the proper degree; but if 
otherwise, boil it till it answers that trial. 
Take particular care that the water used for 
this purpose is very cold, otherwise it will 
lead to errors. 

Fifth Degree, called Caramel Sugar. 

1466. To obtain this degree, the sugar 
must boil longer thnn in either of the former 
operations ; prove it by dij^ping in a stick, 
first into the sugar, and then into cold water; 
but observe, when it comes to the caramel 
height, it will, the moment it touches the 
cold water, snap like glass, which is the 
highest and last degree of boiled sugar. 
Take care that the fire is not very fierce 
when this is boiling, lest, flaming u\i the 
sides of the pan, it should cause the sugar 
to burn, which will discolour and spoil it. 

Little Devices in Sugar.

it up into a paste : colour the paste with 
powders and jellies according to fancy, and 
then make them up into the requisite shape. 
Moulds may be made in any shape, and they 
will be pretty ornaments placed on the tops 
of iced cakes. 

To Boil Sugar to Caramel. 
1468. To every pound of refined su;jar 
allow one gill of spring water ; juice of half 
a lemon. 

Break a pound of refined sugar into a de- 
licately-clean stewpan, pour in one gill of 
spring water. Set it on a clear fire and let 
it boil very quickly, skimming it very care- 
fully as soon as it boils. 

Keep it boiling unfil the sugar snaps, 
which may be known by dipping a teaspoon 
into the sugar, and then letting it drop to the 
bottom of a pan of cold water. If it remains 
hard, the sugar has attained thcris^ht degree ; 
then squeeze in the juice of half a lenion, 
and let it remain one minute longer on the 
fire. Then set the pan in another of cold 
water, and the caramel will be fit for use. 

Have ready moulds of any form, rub the 
insides with oil, dip a fork or spoon into the 
sugar, and throw it over the moulds in fine 
threads or net-work. 

Syrup for Compotes. 

Time, a quarter of an hour to twenty 
minutes. 




1469. One pound of refined sugar ; one 
pint and a half of water. 

Boil a pound of refined sugar in a pint 
and a half of spring water, carefully remove 
the scum as it rises, and the syrup will then 
be fit for use when required. 

To Colour Sugar Red, 

1470. Crush the sugar rouqihlv with a 
rolling-pin, but do rtot pound ft fine. Put 
it in a plate and drop a little prepared 
cochineal over it. Set it before the iire to 
dry. It will then be ready for use. 

Clarified Sugar or Syrup. 
Time, four or five minutes to boil. 

1471. Two pounds of double-refined loaf 
sugar ; one pint of spring water ; half of the 
white of one egg. 

Break into small pieces two pounds of 
double-refined loaf sugar, put it into a clean 
stewpan with a pint of cold spring water. 
When the sugar is dissolved, add "half the 
white of iui egg, which should be well 
beaten. Watch it, and when it boils take 
oil" the scuui, keep it boi'ing till no scum 
vises, and it is perfectly clear, tliQii run it 



through a clean napkin, and the sugar will 
be fit for use. 

Or it may be put into a close stoppered 
bottle, when it will keep for some time. 

Spun Sugar. 
1472, Having boiled the sugar to the fifth 
degree, oil the handle of a wooden spoon 
tie two forks together, the prongs outward' 
dip them into the .sugar lightlv, take theni 
out and shake them to and fro. Let the 
sugar run from them over the spoon, form- 
ing fine silken threads. These you can 
form with your hands into whatever yon 
mav require for garnishing. Or, which is 
really better, you may do so from the lip of 
the sugar-pan. However, it requires prac- 
tice, A good cook will have sugar spinners. 

Icing for Cakes. 

1473. Whites of three eggs ; one pound 
of sugar ; flavouring of vanilla or lemon. 

Beat the whites of the eggs to a high 
froth, then add to them a quarter of a pound 
of white sugar pounded and sifted, flavour 
it with vanilla or lemon, and beat it until it 
is light and very white, but not quite so stiff 
as meringue mi.xture. The longer it is 
beaten the more firm it will become. Beat 
it until it may be spread smoothly on the 
cake. 

To Ice or Frost a Cake. 

1474. When the icing is made as directed, 
place the cake on the bottom of the tin in 
which it was baked. Then spread the icino- 
on the sides with a piece of cardboard aboul 
four inches long and nearly three wide. 
Then heap what you may think sufficient 
for the top in the centre of the cake, and 
with the cardboard spread it evenly over. 
Set it in a warm place to dry and harden i 
after which '^rnament it as you please. If 
sugar ornaments are put on, it must be done 
whilst it is moist or soft ; or if the icing is 
required coloured, pink may be made with 
cochineal syrup, blue with indigo, yellow 
with saffron, green with spinach syrup, and 
brown with chocolate. 

Almond Icing for Bridecake. 

1475. Tile whites of three eggs ; one pound 
of sweet almonds ; one pound of loaf sugar • 
a little rosewater. ' 

Beat the whites of the eggs to a stmn; 
froth, beat -^ pound of almonds very fine 
with a little rosewater, mix the almonds 
with the eggs lightly together, and one 
pound of common white sugar beaten very 
fine and put in by degrees. When the

ChocoC the lightest sprays, and hang them 1 
with the stems upwards on cords stretcl ' 
across the top of the vcssrl so that they do 1 
not touch the bottom. They will attract the j 
ilium in the process of crystallization like the 
thiculs in sugarcandy. The warmer the 
solution when tlicy aie put in the smaller 



will be the cr>'stals attached to them, but 
ca'e must be taken that it be not hot i-ni>ugh 
to destroy the le ives or fronds, and if tlicie 
lie any berries like holly it must be hanlly 
lukewarm. 

The s.ainc solution warmed again will do 
two or three bouquets.

riid. Change the water once or twice w hilst 
they are boiling. When cold, slice the limes, 
removing the pips, and put the lime slices 
into an earthen vessel. 

Boil the sugar, adding a pint of water to 
each two pounds and a half of sugar. When 
it is a clear syrup, pour it boiling hot over

layer of damsons very thickly. Tie the jar 
over securely, and set it in a deep stewpan 
of cold water. Bring it slowly to a boil, and 
then let it siinmer until the damsons are soft 
without being broken; pouroff the juice, and 
boil it for about a quarter of an hour. Put 
the damsons carefully into pots. Strain the 
juice through very thick double muslin, or 
through a "jelly- bag, and pour it over the 
dainsons which have been previously set to 
cool. When the jam is cold, cover the pots 
over with brandy papers, and the tops with 
paper moistened with the white of an egg.

the preparation of your pickles. Fill the 

jars three-parts full with the articles to be 

pickled, and then fill the bottle or jar with 

vinegar. 

When greening, keep the pickles covered 
down, as the evaporation of the steam will 
injure the colour. A little nut of alum may 
be added to crisp picV'es, but it should be 
very small in proportion to the quantity, or 
it will give a disagreeable flavour. 



I same way as the ginger. Then m.is'i it 
well, or cut it in slices. Put the nnistanl 
seed in a mortar with half an ounce of tur- 
meric, half a pound of made mustard, jiiid 
plenty of Cayenne pepper. Whi-n all these 
ingredients are prepared, put them into a 
large stone jar with a gallon of vinugar. 
Stir it well and often for a fortnight, and tie 
it over closely. Into this pickle you c;m

3TTTTER AND CHEESE. 



To Make is utter. 

1713. In order !o make butter well, it is 
necessary that the vessels in which the milk 
is kept be sweet and clean, and the milk- 
room or cellar cool and airy in summer. 

Larg'^ Hn pans are mostly used for milk, 
the broaucst are the best, allowing a greater 
surface for the cream to rise. 

Vessels in which milk is kept, after being 
emptied, must first be washed in cold water 
to take off all the milk, and any remains of 
cream, then fill them with scalding hot 
water, which must be suffered to remain 
imtil nearly cold. One pan may be turned 
over another, which is filled with hot water, 
for a few minutes, then change their relative 
positions, pouring the water from one to the 
other. This will require less time and water 
than the other way. Lastly, wash them 
well in the water and turn them upside 
down in the sun. Tin milk pails are best, 
being most easily kept sweet. White, or 
hard wood pails are generally used, and 
must be washed well in cold water and tlien 
scalded the same as tin pans. Occasionally, 
scour both pails and pans with soft soap 
and sand, and afterwards scald them, rinse 
them in hot water, and dry tiiem m the sun, 
or by a fire. Or, instead of scalding the 
milk tins, and other vessels, as above di- 
rected, have a large vessel of boiling water, 



and having first wa-'ied them in cold water 
(turning it round that every part may get its 
due), let it remain in for a few minutes, then 
wipe them dry, and set them by for use ; 
their own heat will assist the drying. 

Milk strainers are tin basins with a fine 
sieve at the bottom, or with a ring by wliich 
to fasten a linen cloth over a bottomless 
basin. The ring and cloth must be taken 
off every time itis used, and first washed in 
cold water. Allow it to remain in the water 
whilst washing the tins, then wash it out, 
pour scalding water in it, and lastly, rinse it 
in cold water, and hang it to dry. 

A small frame or ladder is wanted to lay 
across the pan and support the strainer 
whilst the milk is poured through. 

For taking the cream from the milk, a 
short handle tin skimmer or shell is used. 
A stone jar or pot is best for keeping cream. 
There should never be more than three days' 
gatherings for a churning ; too long keei)ing 
will make bitter butter. Wash tlie jar in 
cold water, and scald and dry as directed 
for the tins. 

Wooden ware churns are mostly used. 
The old fashioned barrel churn is best for 
small churnings ; a larger sort, in wiiich the 
dasher is suspended and moved back and 
; forth, instead of up and down, is less tire- 
some ; the churn is to be ke[)t sweet and

A wooden tray and ladle are also neces- 
sary for receiving and working the butter 
Riter it is made. 

Care is necessary that the churnmg is 
neither too fast nor too slowly performed, j 
Tlie dashes should be continued at intervals 
of about a second between them, and ; 
steadily, until the butter has come, when a | 
slower and more gentle motion is desirable. ; 
Scald the tray and ladle, then fill it with ; 
cold water until the butter is made. j 

After the butter is fairly gathered, take it 
from the buttermilk, with the ladle, pressing 
it against the sides of the churn, to free it | 
from the milk ; having thrown the water j 
from the tray put the butter in, pour cold 
water over to cover it, and set it in a cool 
place for half an hour to harden it; then 
with the ladle work all the milk from it, 
changing the water until it is clear. It is 
best to have ice water in summer if jjossible 
To each pound of butter put a small table- 
spoonful of fine salt, and a small teaspoon- 
ful of fine white sugar ; work it nicely into 
the butter and make it in rolls, or pack it in 
wooden or stone vessels ; put a piece of 
muslin and a cover to keep the butter from 
the air. 

Butter should be made and kept in a cool 
cclla- or ice house; this direction is particu- 
lady for the summer, when it must be done 
in the coolest part of the day, and the coolest 
possible place. Cold water poured in occa- 
sionally, in small quantities at the dasher, 
will make butter come better in summer. 

In warm weather milk is generally ready 
for skimming after twenty-four hours' stand- 
ing, when the cream is wanted for butter. 

For cream for table or freezing, twelve 
hours' standing is suflicient. lake off the 
cream, let the milk remain until the next 
morning, then skim it and keep the cream 
ior butter. When the weather is cold, let 
the milk become scalding hot without boil- 
ing before straining it. After twelve hrnirs 
it is fit for skimming, and the milk which 
remains will be sweet and fit for common 
purposes. Another way to hasten cream is 
to dip the pans in boiling water before 
straining in the milk; by turning another 
pan scalded in the same manner over the 
pan with the milk, you may greatly facilitate 
the operation. Another way is to .set the 
])ans over vessels of boiling water ; this will 
also cause the cream to rise quickly. 

If you churn in winter pour boiling 
water into the churn, cover it, and let it re- 
main until ready to put in the cream, at 



which time throw it out. Winter churnini; 
."ihoiild be (lone in a moderately warm room. 

The shelves and floor of a milk room 
should be washed and wiped twice a week 
in summer, and once eacli week in winter. 
The place shouUl be sweet and ctiol, ,ind 
free from any mustiness, which will aflect 
the milk. 

Buttermilk and sour milk are used to 
make cottage cheese, as it is sometimes 
called. Buttermilk is also a cooling summer 
drink, and very palatable, sweetened with 
sugar ; a little grated nutmeg may also be 
added. Sour milk and buttermilk are kept 
j for the pigs. 



To Keep Milk and Cream in Hot Weather. 

1714. In hot weather, when it is difficult 

to preserve milk from becoming sour and 

spoiling the cream, it may be kejit pericctly 

sweet by scalding the new milk very gently, 

without boiling, and setting it by in the 

earthen dish or pan that it is done in. Cream 

already skimmed may be kept twenty-four 

hours if scalded without sugar ; and by 

adding to it as nnich powder(;d liim]) sugar 

as shall make it pretty sweet will be good lor 

! two days, keeping it cool. Or milk may be 

i preserved fresh in warm weather by iilacing 

': the jug which contains it in ice, or very cold 

j water. 

I Eollcd Butter. 

1715. Wei! w.'ish the interior of the ninnld 
with cold water, and at all times the greatest 
care must be taken that they are kept deli- 
cately clean. Press the butter into the 
mould, after which it must be opened and 
the shape carefully taken out. Serve it in 
an ornamental glass butterdish, with a little 
water at the bottom ; but if for luncl.jon or 
cheese course it must be placed on a fiat 
glass dish, and garnished with a wreath of 
curled parsley. 

To Freshen Salt Butter. 

7716. Two or three pounds of salt bnfter; 
one small te.ispoonful of fine white sugar ; 
one largeoneof salt to each pound of butter. 
j Take two or three pounds of salt butter, 
I put it into a wooden bowl, pour very cold 
water over it, and work it with a ladle, 
gently pressing it until the water iscohnip'd: 
tlien drain it off, udd more water, and con- 
tinue to work it, changing the water until il 
is clear. Mix a small tea'-poonful of fim- 
white sugar, and a large one of fine salt to- 
I gether for e.ach pound of butter, and after 
ciraining off llie water for the last time, 
strew the mixture over, work it thoiouglily

ing the butter ; then make it into rolls, and 
wrap each piece in a separate piece of mus- 
lin ; or pack it in stone jars, with muslin over 
it, and a cover to keep out the air. Keep 
it in a cold dry place. 

Butter in Haste— From Winter Cream, 
or from the Milk of One Cow. 

1717. Take the milk fresh from the cow ; 
strain it into clean pans. Set it over a gentle 
fire until it is scalding hot; do not let it boil. 
Then set it aside. When it is cold, skim off 
the cream ; the milk will still be fit for any 
ordinary use. When you have a s'lrficient 
quantity of cream, put it into a clean earthen 
basin ; beat it with a wooden spoon until 
the butter is made, which will not be long ; 
then take it from the milk and work it with 
a little cold water. Put a small tablespoon- 
ful of fine salt to each pound of butter and 
work it in ; a small spoonful of fine white 
sugar worked in with the salt is also an im- 
provement. Make the butter into a large 
roll, cover it with muslin, and keep it in a 
cool place. 

To Scald Cream, as in the West of 

England. 

Time, three-quarters of an hour over the fire. 

1718. To stand in the winter twenty-four 
hours ; twelve in the summer. 

Strain the milk into large shallow pans 
about three or four inches deep, and let it 
stand twenty-four hours ; then place the pan 
very carefully upon a hot plate, or slow fire, 
to heat gently, taking care it does not boil, 
or there will be a skim instead of a cream 
Mpon the milk. As soon as the cream forms 
a ring round the pan, and the undulations 
on the surface look thick, it is done : then 
remove it from the fire into the dairy, and 
let it remain for twenty-four hours, 01 if in 
cold weather, thirty-six ; then skim it for 
use. The butter usually made in Devon- 
shire of cream thus prepared is very firm and 
good. 

To Prepare Rennet to Turn Milk. 

1719. Take out the stomach of a calf as j 
soon as killed, and scour it inside and out ; 
with salt. After it is cleared of the curds ! 
always found in it. let it drain a few hours ; 
then sew it up with two handfuls of salt in 
It, or stretch it on a stick, well salted ; or 
keep it in the salt wet, and soak a piece for 
use, which will do over and over agaiu by 
washing it in fresh water. 

To Make Cheese. 
1720. Put the milk into a large tub, warm- 
ing paM of it to a degree of heat equal to 



new milk ; if too hot the cheese will be 
tough. Put in as much rennet as will turn 
it, and cover it over. 1-et it stand till com. 
pletely turned ; then strike the cinxi down 
several times with the skimming-dish, and 
let it separate, still covering it. There are 
;wo modes of breaking the curd, and liiere 
will be a difference in the taste of the cheese 
according as either is observed ; one is to 
gathe. it with the hands very gently towards 
the side of the tub, letting the whey pass 
through the fingers till it is cleared, and lad. 
ling it off as it collects ; the other is to get 
the whey from it by early breaking the curd. 
The last method depiives it of manyofltj 
oily particles, and is therefore less proper, 

Put the vat on a ladder over the tub and 
fill it with curd by a skimmer, press the curd 
close with your hand, and add more as it 
sinks, and it must be finally left two inclies 
above the edge. Before the vat is filled, tli 
cheese-cloth must belaid at the bottom, a: 
when full, drawn smooth over on all sides. 

There are two modes of salting cheese ; 
one by mi.xing salt in the curd while in the 
tub after the whey is out; and the other by 
putting it into the vat and crumbling the 
curd all to pieces with it after the first 
squeezing with the hands has dried it. The 
first method appears best on some accounts, 
but not on all, and therefore the custom of 
the county must direct. Put a board under 
and over the vat, and place it in the press ; 
in two hours turn it out, and put a fresh 
cheese-cloth, press it again for eight or nine 
hours, then salt it all over, and turn it again 
in the vat, and let it stand in the press four- 
teen or si.xteen hours, observing to put the 
cheeses last made, undermost. Before put- 
ting them the last time into the vat pare the 
edges if they do not look smooth. The vat 
should have holes at the sides and at the 
bottom to let all the whey pass through. 
Put on clean boards, and change and scald 
them. 

To Make Sage Cheese. 

1721. Red sage leaves ; leaves of spinach. 

Bruise the tops of some young red sage in 
a mortar with some leaves of spinacii, and 
I squeeze the juice; ini.x it with the rennet in 
! the milk, more or less according as you like 
1 the colour and taste. When the cuid has 
■ come, break it gently, and put it in with the 
\ skimmer till it is pressed two inches above 
I ihe vat. Press it eight or ten hours, salt it, 
' and turn it every day. 

1722. The milk being set, and the curd 
come, do not break it witli a dish as is custo- 
mary in making other cheeses, but draw it

tof^cther with your hands to one side of the 
vessel, breaking it gently and regularly, for 
if it is pressed roughly a great deal of the 
richness of the milk will go into the whey. 
Put the curd into the cheese vat as you thus 
cither it, and when it is full, press and turn 
it' often, salting it at different times. 

These cheeses must be made seven or eight 
inches in thickness, and they will be fit to 
cut in about twelve months. 

You must turn and move them frequently 
upon the shelf, and rub them with a coarse 
cloth. At the year's end, bore a hole m the 
middle, and pour in a quarter of a pint of 
wine. Stop up the hole with some of the 
cheese, and set it in a wine cellar for six 
months to mellow. This cheese, if properly 
managed, will be exceedingly rich and line, 

An Excellent Cream Cheese. 
Time, three days. 

1723. One quart of good cream. 

Put a quart of good cream aside to become 
sour and very thick, then lay apiece of thin 
calico inside a small hair sieve, taking care 
that the calico comes quite to the top, and 
rather above it, in order that you may be 
able to pull out the cheese without any diffi- 
culty ; let the sieve stand upon a dish ; pour 
the cream into the sieve and leave it to drain. 
Pour away the whey from the dish every 
morning. In about three days the cheese 
will be a proper consistency and fit to eat- 
as thick as butter, and very' delicious. If 
the cream will not all go into the sieve at 
once, pour it in during the day, as the rest 
sinks from the whey leaving it. 

At Dieppe little baskets are sold (heart- 
shape) for making cream cheeses, and an- 
swer the purpose exceedingly well, being very 
open, so that the whey drains quickly 
through the calico into the dish. 

Cream Cheese. 

Time, three or four days for the a-eam to 
drip ; one hour to press. 

1724. Three gills of thick cream ; one 
taVjle.spoonful of salt. . 

Take three gills of thick cream, and stir 
into it a tablespoonful of salt. Tie up the 
cream in a cloth, and let it drop for three or 
four days, changing tiie cloth every day. 
It must'behung upon a nail to drip, and 
when ready, on the third or fourth day, put 
it into a wooden mould, and press for one 
hour. It will then be ready for eating. 



Napkin Cheese. 
Time, three day.";. 

1725. One pint of thick cream ; one tea- 
spoonful of salt. 

Put a pint of thick cream and a teaspoon- 
fiil of salt into a cloth, which should be 
placed in a sieve the size of a te.xsaucer. 
Let it stand for twenty-four hours, then turn 
it. Let it stand another whole (hiy and turn 
it. The day following it will be ready to 
seiTO. 

Artificial Cheese. 

1726. One gallon of new milk ; two 
quarts of cream; six or eight eggs ; six or 
seven tablespoonfuls of vinegar; and a little 
salt. 

Boil one gallon of milk with two quarts 
of cream, add six or eight eggs well beaten, 
and si.K or seven large spoonfuls of wine 
vinegar. Let it simmer until it comes to a 
tender curd, then tie it in a cheese-cloth, 
and hang it to drain for several hours, after 
which open the cloth, work some salt to the 
cheese, then lay a cloth in a colander or 
cheese-hoop, put the curd in, fold the cloth 
over, and lay a heavy weight upon it for one 
hour, or longer ; then turn it on a dish and 
serve. 



Milk Cheese. 
Time, fourteen hours. 

1727. Five quarts of new milk ; two table- 
spoonfuls of rennet water. 

Put five quarts of warm milk into a bowl 
with two large spoonfuls of rennet water. 
When the curd is formed break it gently 
with the hand, drawing it to the side of the 
basin or bowl. Let it stand for two hours. 
Spread a cheese-cloth over a sieve or round 
basket, put in the curd, let it drain until all 
the whey is off, and then salt it to your taste. 
Lay a cloth in a cheese-hoop, put in the 
curd, and lay a cloth over it. Put a wooden 
cover the size of the inside of the hoop over, 
place a two pounds weight upon it, and let 
it remain for twelve hours. Then take it 
out, put it in a frame, or tie a cloth tightly 
round it, and turn it from one side to the 
other every day until dry, then nib the out- 
side with a little butter, and sprinkle pepper 
over to keep the flies from it. Put it to ripen 
between two ; cwter plates. If the weather 
is warm it will be ready in three weeks, «f 
cold it will require a longer lime.

Family Brewing. 

Not many persons in tlie present day 
brew at home ; but as some few might wish 
to do so, we give the following receipt sup- 
pUed by a friend, and used in his family. 

1776. Four bushels of malt ; sixty gallons 
of water; (for small beer, after the first is 
drawn off, forty more gallons); three pounds 
of good Farnham hops ; three-quarters of a 
pint of yeast. 

The copper should hold forty gallons of 
water, which siiould, when boiling, be put 
into the mash vat. When it has stood until 
you can see your fi\ce in the water, then 
mash the malt in it, and stir it well till it is 
all wet. Cover it up with sacks to keep in 
the steam. To four bushels of malt put 
forty gallons of boiling water, let it stand 
one hour and a half, then add /w;«/j'gallons 
more water, let it stand two hours and a 
half longer, which will make in the whole 
four hours. When you add the water to the 
n.alt the second time, wet the hops with a 
bucket or two of boiling water. During this 
time the brewer should scald his barrel, and 
have forty gallons of boiling water ready to 
go on the malt when thefirst liquor is drawn 
off, which will make good small beer. Three 
pounds of good Farnham hops will be suffi- 
cient for this quantity, which we call ale and 
small beer. Be sure to boil your first wort 
with the hops at least three-quarters of an 
hour ; keep it boiling all the time— gallop- 
ing ; (boil the small beer the same tiine). 
Tlien strain oft the wort, in the shade if 
possible. When it is lukewarm, put it into 
the tun tub, and set it to work with half a 
pmt of yeast. The next day draw it off into 



the barrel. When the beer has done ferment- 
ing, bii-.g it down close; observe to p.\.ste 
bro'.n paper over the vent hole with a little 
yc-ast, lest it should ferment, which is some. 
times the case, but be sure to keep it 
stopped down as soon as the fernientatioi-. is 
over. The casks should hold thirty-thrc';or 
thirty-six gallons. You will find a smail 
barrel very useful to hold the overplus of ale 
which you will sometimes iiave, and wliicli 
will be fit to drink sooner. Observe tlh' 
same rules with strong beer, only with tlio 
addition of one and a half bushels of malt 
more, and two pounds of hops, and then 
your second tun will be very good x\\)V 
beer, and you may make twenty gallons of 
small beer for common use. Be sure to 
see the barrels arc well cleaned with scalding 
(not boiling) water, A yard of small ch.iin 
is a very good thing to put into the barals, 
to clean them. Very much depends on the 
cleanliness of the vessels. As soon as the 
casks arc empty be sure to cork them close, 
or they will get musty, which can never he 
remedied. You inay add yeast to the small 
beer, and tun it as soon as it is cold. You 
must not stir the mash when you add the 
water to the first beer, but pour it milk-warm 
over the top of the malt. 

Directions for Brewing in Cottages- 
Time, three or four days. 

1777. One peck of malt ; two ounces of 
hops ; six gallons of water ; a few birch 
twigs, or a little wheat straw ; oneteacupful 
of yeast. 

Boil three gallons of water ; take it off as 
soon as it boils, and let it stand till you can 
see your face in it. While the water is 
heating, get ready a clean rinsing-tub witli a 
small hole bored in the bottom, and stopped 
with a peg or cork. Cover it with a few 
birch twigs or some clean wheat straw, put 
a coarse bit of cloth over the bottom of the 
tub, then put in the malt. Pour the water 
on it, and stir it well for a few minutes. 
Cover it close with a sack, and let it stand 
for three days to keep warm near the fire ; 
then pull out the peg or cork, and let the 
whole run into a bucket. Put the peg in 
again immediately, and having prepared 
another three gallons of water just as you 
did before, pour it on the malt, and set it by 
the fire as before, covered close, for two 
hours. As soon as you have emptied the 
second three gallons of water out of the 
boiler, put into it the linst run from the malt,

Luncheons in small families (not of lari^e 
means) generally consist of the cold meat nr 
poultry left from dinner; of cake, bread, 
cheese, &c.; but this slight repast ought to be 
jiroperiy served at all times, so that the ser- 
vant mav never feel awkward at the presence 



of unexpected guests. The butter shoiiM 

be sent up in summer in a glass dish with 

water ; in winter garnished with parsley. 

The bread should be placed on the table on 

a wooden platter; the cheese on a nice cliecso 

cloth. Everything must be as neat and niw 

as possible. We give two specimens of 

i luncheons, such as are ordinarily sent up for 

I guests. Home luncheons must be directed 

by the mistress of the family, according to 

j her taste and means.

Desserts. 



The dessert is placed on the table from 
the first in the dinners k la Russe ; but 
sometimes the top and bottom dishes are 
added after the dinner is over. Even at 
family dinners this mode is the best. Be- 
tween and amongst the dishes it is usual to 
put small glass dishes with preserved ginger, 
damson cheese, candied apricots, or any other 



of the sweet dishes given in our dessert re. 
ceipts. Roasted chesnuts should be sent up 
hot on a folded table-napkin. We prefer al- 
monds blanched for the raisins, but some 
people like them better in their skins. A 
few wine biscuits should be put round the 
centre cake, and olives are sometimes re- 
quired for the gentlemen. 



Suppers. 



" A lady has full space for exercising her 
taste at the supper table. A good eye for 
colour will give a great charm to the ar- 
rangement. With flowers, fruit, frothed 
whipped creams, coloured jellies, and all 
the elegance of sweet dishes, she can 
scarcely fail to ofier a perfect picture of 
gastronomic beauty to the eye, if siie wili 
take a little care in the arrangement of the 
table herself. A plan drawn out on paper 
and given to an intelligent servant, will 




secure her from mistakes generally ; if her 
footman is inexperienced, she should first 
glance at the table herself before her guests 
are invited to it. For two or three evening 
guests, a few sandwiches, a cake, fruit, and 
wine will suffice, as people now generally 
dine late. We offer the plan of two suppers, 
not so eiciborate as those provided by Guntc- 
would be, but sufficient for ordinary enter- 
tainments.

X7SEFTTL BECEIPTS FOR HOUSEKEEPERS AND 

SERVANTS. 



To Clean Chimney Pieces. 

1819. Equal quantities of soft soap and 
pcarlash. 

Put tlie sonp'and pcnrl-ash on the cliimney 
piece with a soft flannel, let it lay on tlie 
marble for a few minutes. Wash it off witli 
warm water not too liot ; wash it over a 
second time with cold spr z water. 

For Bright Polished Grates. 

1820. Oil the bright part of the j^ratewith 
good salad oil, dust over it some unslackcd 
lime from :i muslin bag. Let it remain one 
month, then rub it off with a fuie rac;. 
I'olish it with a leather and a very little 
putty powder. If the grate is not in use 
put on the oil again. 

To Take Stains out of Marhle. 

1821. Mi.xed unslaeked lime in finest 
powder with the stron<;er soap- lye pretty 
thick, and instantly with a painter's brush 

V it on the whole of the m.nble. In two 
nths" time wash it off perfectly clean. 
\ ,en have ready a fine thick lather of soft 
soap, bulled in soft water, dip a brush in it, 
and scour the marble with powder not as 
common cleaning. This will, by very good 
rubbing, give a beautiful polish. Clear off 
the soap, and finish with a smooth hard 
brush till the end be eftccted. 

To Take Rust oat of Steel. 

1822. Cover the steel with sweet oil well 
rubbed in, ant! in forty-eight hours use un- 
slacke \ lime findy powdered, and rub until 
all the rust disappears. 

To Cement Broken China- 

1823. Beat lime to a very fine almost in- 
vi.sihle dust, sift it through book n .lin. 
Then tie it up in a piece of thin muslin as 
powdered starch is sometimes used. Brush 
some white of egg over the edges of the 
china, dust the lune rapidly over thein, put 
the edges together, and tie a string round 
the cup, &c., till It is firm. 

Isinglass dissolved in spirits nf wine, in 
the proportion of one ounce t* two wine- 
glassfuls of the spirit, is also a good cement. 

For Removing Paint from Wood. 

1824. One pound of washing soda ; two 
pounds of unslaeked lime. 

Mix cue pound of washing ^oda with two 



poundsof unslaeked lime, and if the paint is 
very strong on the wood aild half a pound 
0/ pot.uh. Mix these iniTrcdieiU- together, 
and dilute with water until the mixture be- 
comes rather thicker than whitewash, and 
then rub it on the paint with a piece of 
wood folded u[) in rag. The person who 
uses Diis preparation must be careful not to 
tou'jh it witii the ham's. 



To Clean Papcr-liangings. 

1825. First blow the dust off w' 



the 



lit parts, 'i'.ike the crust ituo 
.ind, beginning at the top ol the 



bellows. Divide a white ](i;\f of eight days 
old into cii 
your haiul, 

paper, wipe it downwards in the lii;hte>t 
manner with the crumb. Do not cross or 
!!;o upwards. The diit of the paper and the 
crumbs will fall together. Observe -vou 
Miu'-t not wipe alir.ve half a yard at a stroke, 
ind after doing all the upjier part go round 
.:gain, beginning a little iibove were you left 
off. If you do not clean it very lightly you 
will make the din adhere to the paper. 

To Clean Glazed Chintz Furniture when 
taken down for the Summer. 

1836, Shake off the loose dust, then 
liglitly bnish with a small long-haired fur- 
niture brush ; after which, wipe it closely 
with clean flannels, and rub it with dry 
bread If properly done, the curt.iins will 
;ook nearl" ns *11 as at first, and if the 
colour b< net i.t;ht they will not require 
wishing for years. Fold in large parcels 
and nut carefully by. 

While the furniture remains up, it .should 
be preserved from the sun and air as much 
as po-^sible. which injure delicate colours ; 
•and the dust may be blown off by bellows. 
By the above method, curtains may be kept 
sufficiently clean, to make up a^'ain with new 
linings. 

To Remove Paint Stains from Glass 
Windows- 

1827. It frequently happor.s that painters 
splash the plate or other gla^s windows when 
they are painting the sills. When this is the 
case, melt some soda in very hot water and 
wash them with it, using a s(;ft Uanuel. It 
will entirely remove the paint. 



1828. 



Table Polish. 
Half a pint of ■spirits of wine 



an 



ounce and a half of gum shellac ; half an 




344 



Useful Receipts. 




u 



I! 



ounce of pum beiuoin ; half an ounce of 
gum sanilrar?. 

Put the wholo in a bottle for a day or two, 
and shake it a few times. When the gums 
are dissolved it is fit for use. 

When the polish is laid on thick enough, 
take a clean wad and cloth ; put a little 
clean spirits of wine on the wati, the same 
as you did with the polish, rub it the same 
way, but veiy lightly, and until quite dry. 
You must then put a little oil on the cloth, 
and rub as in laying on the polish. 

Anotlier Furniture Polish. 

T82f). Three rIIIs of cold drawn oil : one 
pill of turpentine ; one gill of varnish of tur- 
pentine ; one of vinegar. 

These quantities will fill a qu.Trt bottle. 

Pour a few drops in the middle of the 
t.ible, add a teaspoonful of cold spring 
water, and rub with a soft cloth. 

To Clean Covers and Tins- 
1830. Il.alf a pound of soap; a ball of 
pounded whitening ; sufficient warm water 
to make it of the consistency of very thick 
cn-am. 

.Shred the soap into a jug. add a large 
ball of pounded whitcniii ;, and pour in suf- 
ficient warm water to make it of the consist- 
ency of a thick cream ; rub it well over the 
tins, and when dry, polish them with a clean 
leather and powdered whitening. 



To Clean Plato. 

1831. One ounce of prep.ired hiirlshorn- 
powder ; one quart of water. 

Boil an ounce of prepared hartshorn- 
powder in a quart of water; while on the 
fire, put into it as much plate as the vessel 
will hold ; let it boil a few minutes, take it 
out, drain it over the saucepan, and dry it 
ne.ir the fire. Then put into the water some 
pieces of linen, and let them remain to soak 
up all the water. When dry, put them aside 
to clean the phite, &c. When the plate is 
dry, rub it well with wash leather. 

To Make Blacking. 

1832. Four ounces of ivory black ; three 
ounces of treacle ; a tablespoonful of sweet 
oil; a pint and a half of small beer; one 
ounce of sulphuric acid. 

Mix whh a spoonful of sweet oil the four 
ounces of ivory black, and the three ounces 
of treacle ; pour on it by degrees a pint and 
a half of small beer. Stir it well together, 
and then pour in an ounce of sulphuric acid, 
keeping it till the eftervesccnce ceases 
hmX'i It, and it may be used immediately. 



A Beceipt for Blacking. 

1833. Two ounces of sugarcandy ; one 
ounce of sulphuric acid ; half an ounce of 
gum arable ; a quarter of an ounce of blue 
mdigo ; half an ounce of tur|)entine ; four 
ounces of ivory black ; two tablespoonfiils 
of oil ; one quart of good vinegar. Mix all 
together. 

To Bleach Linen. 

1834. A quarter of a pound of chloride of 
lime ; one gallon of water. 

Pour a gallon of boiling water over four 
ounces of chloride of lime ; let it stand two 
days, stirring it occasionally, then pour it 
clear off into bottles. To bleach linen take 
.-ibout half a pint, and mix it with a quart or 
three pints of cold spring water. Mix it well 
together, and .after the linen is washed and 
rinsed from the so.ap, steep it in the lima 
water for- a few hours. 

To Take Stains ont of Silk or Cloth. 

1835. Pound some French chalk fine, and

Previously, however, she will carry in the 
urn that her mistress may make tlie tea. 

She then has h-T own hrcakiast. goes up 
to the bedrooms, opens tiie wuulows, strips 
the bedclothes off, and leaves the mattresses 
or beds open. 

Bv this time probably the bell will ring 
for her to clear away the breakfast tilings. 
She should do this quickly and carefully; 
bring a dustpan, and ^weep up the crumbs, 
put back the chairs, make up the fire, and 
sweep up the hearth. 

The china must be washed and put away, 
and the kitchen tidied a little. Her mistress 
will then give her orders about dinner. 

As soon as these are settled, she will put 
on a large clean apron in 'Ahich to make 
the beds, that she may not soil the bed- 
clothes with her working dress. 'I'lie mis- 
tress of the house general ly assists a maid 
ofallworkin making the beds but this is 
by no means a riiiht of the servant's, and 
very fiequentlv she lias to do tliem alone. 

In m.iking beds, siie should carefully tarn 
the mattresses every day, shake the feather 
beds well, and rub out any lumps tliat may 
have gathereil in them. The sheets should 
always be placed with the marked end 
towards the pillow. 

When the beds are made and slops 
emptied, the rooms should be can^fully 
dusted. 

Tiien she sweeps down the stairs, and 
dusts the banisters. She sweeps the dust 
from each stair into a dustpan, and is care- 
ful that no dust flies about the passage, or 
hall wiiich she has already dusted. 

She now cleans the drawing-room grate 
(if a fire is burnt there), and dusts the room. 
Dusting the ornaments is often done by 
the mistress, but cannot always be expected. 
The maid of all work returns to the 
kitchen, puts on a large canvas apron which 
will tie all round her. and which has a bib. 
and proceeds to cook her dinner. While 
t!ie meat is roasting o. boiling, any little 
i.itchen work which will not take her away 
hom the neighbourhood of tiie fireplace, 
may be done. 

Half an hour before taking up her dinner, 

f^he will lav her cloth nicely, according to 

' rootman's r>iities," 

, &o., ready on the 



ilie directions given in • 
iind will set bicad, ice 
bull-board, 

.She cannot, of course, be expecteil to wait 
at table, but she should remove lier coarse 
.ijiroii, and be ready to bring in the pud- 
daig, or tart, or clieese when reciuired. 

When she has taken a-.viy the dinner 
(she will do wisely to place the joint to 
warm before the kitchen fire (or her own 
diraier), she sweeps and folds up the table- 



cloth, sweeps up the crunilis under the 
dining table, m.ikes unthe tin' (if ie(|iiiiv(i), 
or if the room is left v.ic.uit, opens the 
windows. 

'1 hen she dines bciself, spreading her 
own cloth nicely, and giving herseli time 
for a com'orlable meal. 

After dinner, she has a kettle of boiling 
water ready, washes up tlie dishes and plates.^ 
cleans the' knives (washing the grease off 
carefully before she rubs them on the knife- 
board), washes the silver spoons and Ibrks, 
and just rubs them over with the leather ; 
cleans anv boots and shoes required, and 
then cleans up her kit- hen, sweeps up the 
health, and goes to w < ii and dress heiself. 
ller nrxt duly istobiiiig in the tea, make 
the toa«^t. iScc. 

After tea. she turns down the beds, sres 
that tlu'ie is water in every jug and liottle, 
shut^ liie windows, and d.aws <lo\vn the 
Dlinds. Tiiese are tiie ordinary dailv duties; 
but in Older that the hou>e uiav be well 
cleaned, every bedroom should be swept 
oine a week, and tlie tins and r,ilver must 
have weekly attention beyond tiiat of the 
daily w.ishing. 

A good servant will manage her work by 
division. 

I'or e\ami)lc :— On Saturday she wdl 
thoroughly clean the hall, ii:., wash the 
canvas, rub any maliog.iny, &c., and sweep 
the stairs very thcrougiily, occasionally 
taking up the stair-carpets, and replaeiag 
them" so that thev m ay not wear out by the 
same part being always at the edge ol tlie 
; lairs. She must also rub and clean the 

brass rods. , ,- . , 

She will seldom have more than four Ij'vl- 
rooms to do. She can sweep two on 
'luesday ; the dr.uving- room m.iy be 
thoroughly swept on Wednesday ; two bed- 
rooms iniv be swept on Tlunsd.iy ; Hie 
maho'vaiiv' furniture, &c., well polished lu 
the dining-room on Krid.iy. On S.iturday 
she will clean the plat.-, and h.-r tins -as 
covers. &c.— and clean ui) her kitchen for 

Sunday. „ , , 

A good servant will generally wash up the 
glasses and plates after M\^\y^s, and nut 
leave them for the morning. She wul care- 
fully fasten up the hou ,e. 

Tlie general servant should ask lier nns- 
fr<-ss for housemaid s gloves, and endeavour, 
as much as possible, to ke.-p lier h.o.ds 
clean, so as never to leave spuitty mirks ol 
fiu-'eis on anvihing she to.icli-s ller hair 
should be banded caieiuUy b.ick. and be 
keiit smooth, find her f.u-.c clean ; and as

white one, kept within reach— for instance, 
in the kitchen drawer. 

She should be careful never to pour the 
water in which eggs have been boiled over 
her hands, as It will bring warts. If her 
hands get cliapped in winter, she will do 
well to rub them with a httle camphor-ball 
when she goes to bed at night. 

We insist on this care for the hands, not 
to encourage fine ways or vanity, but be- 
cause a general servant's hands are used 
both for very dirtv and very than work, 
and without care they will be unfit for the 

Recollect, my little general servant, that 
if your place is a hard one. it is also the 
best possible one for training you for a 
better. After all. too, you have not more 
to do. nor. in fact, so much as you would 
have as the mistress of your own home 
when married, when you would probably 
have to clean house, work for your family's 
support, and take care of cliiltln-ii, besides 
enduring an.\iety and the many cares of 
the mother and wife. 

In your place von have no care for daily 
bread or clothes.' Your food and raiment 
arc sure, and you have every comfort. 

If you rise carlv, bustle about, and waste 
r.o spare moments, you will get through 
your work very well— only do think about 
it. A little ain\ns;cment and thought will 
give you Mivnioi) and IIABIT. two fairies 
that will maki the work disappear before a 
ready pair of hands. If. when you put your 
head on your pilUow, you would just ;»/.i« 
liow best to get through next day s work, i 
you would find it a great help. 

Try not to fors^d ortlers. Uo everything 
as well as possible at once. Renu-mlKT, 
"Once well done is twice done;" "A 
place for ^jverything, and everything in its 
place." 

lie sure always to w.ash china, r.e., cups, 
saucers, p'.ites in very hot water, with a 
little sod.i occasionally (but not if they have 
gilt edges), and wii)o them dry on a very 
clean dry cloth. A \v<-t dirty cloth will make 
them smeary nnd sticky, than which nothing 
can lie more nastv. 

Find tuiu- for vour own work of an even- 
ing, and take caie to leave no holes in your 
stockings, or rcats unmended. " A stitch 
in time' saves nii>e ;" and if every Saturday 
nii'ht you mend all fractures, both \n the 
clo'thes that return and those that are gomg 
to the wash, you will keep your needlework 
nicely under. 

Ife personal'<f clean. It is the great charm 
of ladies ; and a good wash nil <ner every 
night before going to bed will refresh you, 



cheerful than if you fell asleep still dirty 
from your daily toil. 

Be active, cheerful, good-tempered, and 
obliging, and you will find work easy 
and employers kind. 

Do your daily diilii^s "with all your 
might," remembering Whose eye is alwiy.-i 
on you ; and believe that the Great Km:^ 
who gives us all our daily work to do, will 
not leave unmarked the efforts of even a

' Duties of the Housemaid. 

The duties of the housemaid require onirr, 
method, and great cleanliness to be well 
fuliilled. If more than one is kept, the 
work will be fairly divided between them, 
bn# whether divided, or done by one. its 
nature is still the same. 

A hoiisemaid, if she wishes to get her 
work done easily and with comfort, should 
be an early riser. She should get up at six 
in summer, and half-past six or seven in 
winter ; though, of course, much mu.-i dt- 
pend (as to hourb) on the rules of the ser- 
vice in which she is engager:. 

Her first care on going downstairs from 
her bedroom will be to open the shutters of 
the sitting-rooms. If it is winter, she must 
take up the hearth-rugs, and move the 
fenders. She should then spread a piece of 
coarse wrapping canvas before the grates, 
and cleam tlie latter, after which she lightJ 
the fire. She nmst have a tin cinder-pail, 
with a win; sifter to sift the cinders, a lunise- 
maid's box, with black-lead, and her stove- 
brushes. With a soft brush she will lay on 
the blacklead. and then polish it with a 
proper brush for that purpose. It is a great 
credit to a housemaid when her grates arc 
nicely polished. She should regularly every 
morning rub with a dry leather all tlie 
polished parts of a grate, and also the 
fender and fire-irons. Generally there are 
two sets of bars to a drawing-room gnite- 
bright st#el, for summer use, and black for 
winter. If constantly well rubbed, no ntst 
will ever appear on them. Should any be 
accidentally found, a receipt for removing 
rust-spots will be found in this book. 

And now about lighting the lues. If tlus 
is done badly the room will be filled wiih 
smoke, which is very injurious to furmtai.-. 
It is well when first winter fires are com- 
menced to hol<l a blazing paper up the 
chimney for a few minutes before the lir>t 
fire is lighted. This will dispel the cold air j 
in the chimney, which m.iy otherwise heat 
the smoke down into the room. 1 he fire n

the bottom of the grate ; then a piece of

paper — «t>/ coarse lirown, which will 
smoulder — and then a few crossbars of 
pieces of wood, which should be kept well 
dried; on the wood some rubbly coals— not 
too close together, fi>r a draught is required 
to kindle the fuel. The coals must be well 
back in the grate. Light with a lucifer 
match— use Bryant and May's, because they 
will not ignite unless they are rubbed on 
ihcir own box, and thus they arc less dan- 
gerous than those which will kindle by 
stepping on. . , ^ r 

If the grate smokes, light the fire from 
the top. In order to .achieve this properly, 
cover the bottom of the grate with a piec- 
of coarse thick paper ; build a wall of rubbly 
coals round, ieavin,^ a hole in the middle; 
cover it all with a piece of dry paper ; lay 
pieces of wood crossing each other on it ; 
then put a piece more paper, and steady it 
with a few good cinders. Set light to the 
under paper. The sticks, &c., will kindle, 
and fall into the hollow centre. In about an 
hour there will be a good fire, which will not

room is finished, th(" housemaid sweeps 
down the stairs. 

She then puts on a clean white .ipron. and 
making liersclf look as nice and fresh as 
possible, lays the brcakf.isl-t.ible, if no foot- 
man or parlourmaid is kept. She takes 
care to pl.ice everything that cm possibly !>«

Duties of the Cook. 



early dinner. Slic must then Iny the cloth 
for eitlier meal, and be ready to bring in the 
dislies and wait table. 

She does not wait hincheon ; but leavinq; 
plates, &c., and all that may be required on 
the dumb-waiter or wagRon, goes to her own 
dinn'T. Though, if it is an early dinner- 
net iunchcon— the servants generally dine 
after die family. 

She will then, when the dinner is re- 
moved, rub the mahogany table with a 
duster, to remove any marks of diJihes, and 
sweep up the crumbs, leaving the window 
open tor a time to remove the smell of dui- 
ncr. 

She washes up the glass and silver (the 
latter ■^hoald b" just rubbed with a leather 
when it is drwfd from the hot water), and 
sets everything to rigiits, and prepares for 
tea. She will, o* course, have time in tlie 
afternoon for doing needlework, such as 
mending the slockuigs, &c., or the house- 
linen, if required. 

She lays th»- tea, -emovcs it, washes up 
the tea-things, turns down the beds, takes 
away all slo|w shuts the wmdows, draws 
down the blujii-, and places the bedroom 
candles in tke hall ready for use. 

SwAm of the Cook. 

When two servants only are kept, the cook 
is expected to clean the dining-room, as 
well as the Iwll, pass.nge. steps, &c. Of 
course, evf 'hui" relating to the cleaning of 
the kiic'ueti. sculieiy, &c., will also belong 
to you. 

When thw dirty morning work is done, 
you should 'irefiiily wash your hands, and 
«fBit the 1.11 if'r Here you should look to 
#«w;rylhmg , mc if the harging meat or 
gjime requin". cooking, change the soup to 
pR«vent Its grttinf^ sour, and wipe out tlic 
bread-pan. Th» uder should be scrubbed 
and cleaned out 1 wice u week. 

Recei** your mistress's orders attentively; 
and if your memory cannot be relied on, 
write them on a sl.atc. 

Don't "scatter" in the kitchen. Clear up 
as you go, an<l be sure to put scalding water 
into each saucepan or stewpan as you finish 
using it. 

Weigh the joints the butcher brings you ; 
and never omit asking him for the paper of 
weight. Kxaniine the meat, and if it is not 
good do t. )t receive it. 

Keep ii strict account of tlve milk, bread, 
&c., used weekly ; and have an eye to your 
mistress's interest, n<^t permitting waste of 
any kind in the kitchen. 

A uuuk who is just and honest, and does 



as she would be done by, is worthy of the 
greatest respect, and may be sure of being 
successful and happy. 

And now let us give our good inexpe- 
rienced friend a few hints as to kitchen-woik. 

Keep your spice-box always replenished ; 
and take care to let your mistress know if 
you are out of anything likely to be required, 
that its place may be supplied at once. 

He scrupulously careful not to use a knif- 
that has cut onions for any other purpo<^c. 
Put it carefully aside to be cleaned. Tak'- 
care if you have copper utensils to use tliat 
the tin does not become worn off. If so, 
have it instantly replaced. Dry your sauce- 
pans before you put them away. 

Pudding cloths and jelly bags require cnro. 
Wash the pudiling cloths, scald tliem, nnd 
hang them to dry directly after using tlu'in, 
and keep them in a warm dry jjl.ice, well 
airing them before you put them away, or 
they will sinell musty. After washing up 
dishes wash out the tubs used for the pur- 
pose with soap and water, and soda. Scrub 
them often. Stand them up sideways to 
dry. Keep the sink and sink brush very 
clean, and be careful never to throw anythini; 
but water down the former, lest you .shoiilil 
choke it uj) ; but never pour cabbage water 
down, as the smell is so unpleasant that it 
should always be carried outside the house, 
and thrown away where it is not likely tu be 
perceived. Never have sticky, greasy plates 
.and dishes. The way to avoid tliis is to use 
very hot wafer, and clean dry towels. Change 
the water when it is gre.asy. Perfectly clean 
jjlates .and dishes are one proof of the cook 
being a good servant. Clean the coppers 
with turi>entinc and fine brick-dust, rubbed 
on with fl.mnel. and polish them with a 
leather and a little dry brick-dust. Clean the 
tins with soap and whitening, rubbed on 
with a flannel. Wipe them with a dry soft 
cloth, and polish with a clean leather and 
powdered" whitening, or use the exceller.t 
receipt in this volume. 

Never scrub the inside of a frying-pan. 
Rub it with wet silver sand put on a leather, 
and wash it out with hot water afterward?, 
Be very particular in washing vegetables. 
Lay cauliflowers and cabbage in salt and 
water, to get out insects, &c., &c. If a 
dinner-party is in prospect, ask for the bill 
of fare, and get ready all you can the dav 
before, to save worry and scrambling on the 

dav fised. ,», , 

Whisk the white of eggs for souffles, lemon 
and sponge-cakes, till they will bear the 
weight of an egg on them. This will ass\ire 
thelightness of your cakes and souffles ; the 
latter ought to fly up like huge bubbles to

be really exccU-nt. Take notice of all orders 
that require time in the preparation of the 
dinner, and hurry nothing:. 

Wear large aprons and clo"!e dre^'ses, so 
that you mr<y avoid the risk of fire, and tnkc 
especial care to bind back your hair so th;it 
there may be no chance of a loose one fail- 
ing into your preparations. lixquisite clcan- 
iihcss ttlh even on the taste of the dishes 
preferred. 

Be careful ol fuel. It is a proat recom- 
mendation to a cook to u'-e only the mccs- 
sary amount of coals. If you cook by a 
grate, screw the sides nearer to each other 
when the fire has ceased to be required. 

The Farloarmaid. 

The parlourmaid takes iho duties of an 
upper housemaid, and the waiting of a loot- 
man at meals, &c. 

She cleans plate, lays the table, waits at 
meals, answers the drawing-room bt^ll, and 
the door bell, trims the lamps, aJul performs 
tiie othtr minor duties of a footman. At her 
leisure she works at her needle, and keeps 
the linen in repair. 



The Nurse and Nursemaid. 

The nur-se's duties are very responsible 
ones. She has to watch over the lualth, 
safety, and comfort of the little ones in the 
nursery. She should be a healthy woman, 
very clean in her person, of a bright, cheer- 
ful, good temper. With the assistance of a 
nur.semaid, if the family is large, she must, 
at about seven o'clock, take up and dress the 
children, washing carefully and tenderly 
their faces, necks and arms ; it is best, we 
think, to give them their bath at night. The 
water of the bath should be lukewarm (un- 
less a cold bath is especially ordered). They 
may be washed in cold water in the morning. 
Brush the hair carefully and tenderly so as 
not to hurt the little heads. Wiien the 
children ate dressed, and have said their 
prayers, she should give them their break- 
fast, taking care that they are well and com- 
fortably fed. 

The nursemaid cleans the nursery, sets 
the breakfast, and helps the nurse to dross 
the children ; after breakfast the nursemaid 
makes the little beds, and cleans the night 
nursery. Tlie nurse, directly after breakfast, 
washes and dresses the baby, if there is one 
in the nursery. 

Then the two servants lake the children 
for a wr.lk until it is time for the little ones 
to lie down for their morriiii|[i; nap. All 
ciuklren out of the schoolroom should lie j water 
down for an hour at least, to rase the spine }cllu\v 



of the weight of the head ; they will grow 
stronger and .<itiaightt'r for it. While they 
lie down the nurse can work at her needle. 

After dinner the children walk again. 

The nursf and nursemaid make and mend 
all the children's clotlas. The nur.se should 
try to gft pntty patterns whenever she sce.s 
them for her task, and should take a pride in 
the neatness of her cli.irgos' w.ii(lri)l)es. 

She should rule the nursery with a gentle 
but firm aulhoritv, making the childreii 
obedient and truthful, and l.iking » ire that 
she sets them a good example in all llnnfjs. 

Her influence for good or evil is rrn' .C'''*'/. 
and she should exercise great w.itthfiilnes'., 
that no woid mav meet young ears in the 
nursery that is unfit for them to hear. 

Whenever the children are sent for to tlie 
drawing-room, the nurse should t.ike off 
their pin.ifoies, smooth their hair, and make 
them look nice. The he.ul nurse generally 
takes her meals with the children. 

The Taundryraaid. 

The laundrymuid should collect all the 
linen reciuiring washing on Monday morn- 
ing, count it, and compare it with the list 
given to her. Then she must assort it, put- 
ling the sheets and body linen in one heap, 
the n\uslins .md fine things \\\ another, the 
cotton and woollen in a third. Ink spots, 
fruit stains, t^vc, should be removed. Tiio 
heavy linen should be so.iked in hot water 
all night. The washing begins next morn- 
ing at five or six o'clock. In most large 
households where a lainidrymaid is kept, 
there arc now to be found washing and 
wringing machines, as well as mangles. 
Where these are not found, the old- 
fashioned labour of soaping with yellow 
soap in hot water, and rubbing well, must 
be resorted to. 

The linen should be well washed in two 
waters, and the water should be hot and 
plentiful. Then it should be boiled in the 
cojiper for about an hour and a half, taken 
out, rinsed in clean hot water, then in cold 
water tinged with the blue bag, then wnmg 
thoroughly, and hung out early in the sun- 
shine and air to bleach and dry. 

Coloured muslins should be washed in 
cold water to keep the colour, rubbed with 
yellow soap gently, and himg to dry \'\ a 
shady place xo save the colour fiom fading. 
A little soiia atlded to the wat.r will sa\e 
mauve and lilac from washing out. AVif

rinsing to get ilic soap out of flannel before 
drying. 

To Make Starch. — Mix the starch with 
cold water, using a wooden spoon. Make 
it quite smooth and free from lumps, then 
pour boiling water over it, siirring it all the 
time. When made, stir it round three times 
with a piece of wax candle, to prevent the 
iron from sticking. 

When the washing is ended, scrub and 
put away the tubs, &c. 

Thursday and Friday the laundrymaid 
irons and mangles. JSIie should then air 
the clotlies thoroughly, and fold them neatly 
before giving theuj to the houseiu.iil or 
lady's-maid to sort. 

Great care should be taken not to let wet 
clothes touch iron or a brick floor, for fear 
of iron moulds. Also, the laundress slioukl 
be careful not to tear fine muslin or lac(\ 

Handkerchiefs sliould be ironed iv(t, to 
Stiffen and give thcni a giobs. 

The Duties of a Lady'a^Uaid. 

A lady's-maid is required to be a nice-man- 
nered, respectable-looking young woman. 
She should be a tolerably good dressmaker, 
know how to make a cap or trim a bonnet, 
and she must be a good hairdresser. Her 
firsi morning duty will be to dress her lady, 
about which it is impossible to give direc- 
tions, as ladies differ very much in their 
toilette arrangements. The housemaid 
generally takes up the warm water for the 
lady's bath, but occasionally she prefers her 
own maid doing so. After dressing her 
lady, the maid must examine her wardrobe, 
shake or iron out tumbled dresses, put away 
everything left about the room. She then 
sits down in the housekeeper's room to 
needlework, but must be ready to answer 
her lady's bell when it is rung, and to dress 
her for a walk, drive, or ride, having every- 
thing ready— boots, gloves, &c., in perfect 
order. 

She must have everything prepared also 
for the lady's toilette for dinner, and as soon 
as that is over, and her mistress has left the 
room, she should examine the walking dress, 
brush it if it is a tweed or linsey, shake and 
wipe it, and remove mud stains if it is a silk 
or any light material. Silk dresses should 
be wipt'd with a soft piece of merino or very 
fine tiannel. If anything wants mending 
it should be done at once Everything 
should be carefully dusted and put away, 
either folded or hung in the v.ardrobe. 

She must have the bedroom ready for her 
lady at the usual hour for retiring (or the 
night. If it is winter she must have a 
blight fire, before which she sliould hang 



the night Axe.%%, &c. Hot water should be 
in a can or kettle reatly for use, and the 
brushes put out on the toilette table. Her 
duty is then to undress the lady, and re- 
main in attendance till she is dismissed. 
During the day, when not in actual attend- 
ance, .she will have to mend, make, and 
probably to wash and iron lace and fine 
clothes, as handkerchiefs, collars, cuffs, &c. 
Very little instruction can be given verbally 
on this point. However, a few hints as to 
how best to wash Ilonitonlace, &c., maybe 
of some service. 

7'o Wash fJ 0)1 if. in Lace. — Fold the lace 
evenly together, iui,! tack it lightly on a 
]>iece of flannel ; double the flannel over it. 
Squeeze it constantly (but do not rub it) in 
very hot soapsuds. VVhen clean, let j< dry, 
tiicn op'U it, spread and pin it out on a 
cloth, and carefully pick up and raise all 
the threads. It should be pressed smooth, 
but not ironed. 

To Stiffen Fine Cambric Hattdkerchiefs. 
— Wash them rather by squeezing them in 
hot soap and water than by rubbing them ; 
blue them slightly, rinse them again in 
cold water, and iron them wet with a bo.x^ 
heater. 

Tumbled muslin or thin dresses should be 
pressed out with an iron. 

To Wash Brushes. — Brushes should be 
washed in cold soda and water, and not left 
to soak. Shake the water well out of the 
bristles, and dry in the open air if possible. 
Brush the comb and clean it with a piece of 
thread, but do not wash it. If it is greasy 
and you are compelled to wash it, dip it in 
cold soda and water. A receipt for an ex- 
cellent wash for the hair will be found at the 
end of the book ; also a tooth-powder and 
a valuable receipt for making Eau-de- 
Cologne. Skill in these matters is of great 
service to a maid 

Once a week the lady's-maid will have to 
send the linen to the wah and receive it 
back. She should look over the clothes, 
and mend everything that requires a stitch 
before sending it, making two lists— one in 
the book for the laundress, one ina book to 
be kept at home, comparing the clothes 
with the list when they are returned clean, 
looking at the marks to see that they have 
not been chang'^d at the wash, sewing on 
any buttons, and not permitting bad wash- 
ing, but returning any ill- washed article to 
the laundress. 

Wax spots may be removed from silk or 
woollen dresses by placing a piece of blot- 
ting paper over them and holding a very hot 
iron in the air a little distance above the 
paper : the heat draws out the grease. As 
soon as seen through tlie paper, th« latter

dresses slioirid be 



should be removed to a cleaner part, the 
iron held over the spot again till it is out. 

To Clean a Turned .S/V*.— Wash the 
breadths with spirits of wine, and press 
them with a hot iron the wrong sidi*. or 
rather the worn side of the silk, IJlack 
?ilk is best washed with gin. Spirits of 
turpentine will remove paint spots if freshly 
done. The pile of velvet when cnishctl by 
sitting on it may be raised by holding the 
wrong side above the steam of hot water. 

A respectful manner is required from a 
lady's-maid. She is not to .keep her seat 
while her mistress is speaking to her, unless 
desired, and she is to rise when the lady 
enters the room. 

She has breakfast and tea in the house- 
keeper's room, dines in the servants-hall, 
but retires for her cheese, &c., with the 
housekeeper. A good deal of sitting up at 
night is sometimes required from a^ lady's- 
maid during the London season ; she must 
strive to get what rest she can. and good- 
tcmperedly support any inevitable fatigue. 

A cheerful, kindly performance of her 
duties, deference, obedience, industry, and 
strict honesty will secure ioc her a friend in 
her lady, and a happy homo under all ordi- 
nary cucuinstances. 

The Housekoeper. 

The housekeeper in modern families (ex- 
cept in those of the highest nobility) is gene- 
rally also the cook ; but she has a kiiehon- 
maid under her, who is about the same as 
an ordinary plain cook. 

Her duties as housekeeper require early 
rising, both to get business over well, and 
as an example to the servants. She has her 
breakfast with the butler, lady's-maid, and 
valet, in her own private apartment. After 
breakfast she will make out on a slate her 
bill of fare for the days luncheon and 
dinner, to be submitted to her lady's ap- 
proval. After receiving her orders for the 
day, she will go over the house to see that 
the housemaids have done their duty well ; 
thE.t the furniture is rubbed, carpets' swept' 
&c., &c. Then she has to market, give 
orders to the tradesmen, /ic., &c. After- 
wards her culinary preparations will engage 
her attention. 

She heads the dinner table in the servants' 
hall, but retires to her own room with the 
butler and lady's-maid and valet, for her 
after-dinner cheese. &c. She has her tea 
with the upper servants in the same manner. 

I he still-room maid cleans the house- 
keeper s room, and waits on her. Where 
there is no still-room maid the scullery-maid 
or una«r housemaid generally has to do so. 



It is the hou«ipkeeper's duty to look over the 
house linen and sec that it is kept in good 
repair, and that it returns right from the 
wash. She also directs all cleaning, jinnual 
or otherwise. Once a week she should sub- 
mit her books to her lady to be mspccted 
and j)aid. 

A housekeeper ought to be perfectly trust- 
worthy. She h.as much committed to her, 
and will be respected, and will prosper in 
ox.ict proportion to her fulfilment of the im- 
portant duties devolving on her. 

She should show a tender, motherly care 
towards the younger female servants, and 
endeavour as much as possible to rule them 
wisely and well. Many opportunities of 
doing good will be open to her. llcr in- 
fluence in a large household may be great. 
She should think for all, and endeavour to 
do good to all. Especially should .-^he con- 
sider the interests of her employers, and en. 
dcivour to spend for them as she woulcl 
wish other persons to do for her. 

Directions given to l.uiv housekeepers at 
the beginning of this vo'.uiue will also be of 
use to the professional housekeeper in many 
ways, especially if she is young and jne.x- 
perienccd. 

The Footman. 

The footman is ivfiuired to make hitnself 
generally useful, though, of course, the 
number of men kept will diminish or in- 
crease his work. 

Me hiis to clean knives and shoes, nib the 
furniture, clean the plate, trim the lamps, 
brush his master's clothes, carry up coaN. 
.ittend to tires, open the door, go on errands 
or messages, and go out with the carriage. 
The footm.m must get over his dirty work 
before breakfast— ».<•.. he must clean boots, 
shoes, knives, and lamps, and rub tab'es. <S:c. ; 
then he must make himself tit to go m to pray- 
ers, and carry m the breakfast which he lays. 
He brushes his master's clothes, and cartu s 
them up with his boots and hot water to tho 
gentleman's dressing-room. When there i«i 
no butler kept, he brings in the breakfast 
urn, and afterwards removes the breakfa t 
things. The footman lays the luncheon 
cloth and dinner cloth, and waits table. 

To Lay the Table for Luncheon ami 
Dinner. — He lays the cloth ; puts a water 
bottle (or caratfe) with a tumbler oo it at 
each corner of the table, a salt-cellar and 
two tablespoons at each corner; a sm ill 
knife and two small silver forks and one 
dessertspoon for each person round the 
table, a carving knife and fork at the top 
and bottom of the table, and a tablespoon 
near every side-dish ; (be cruet-stand ia the

centre of the table, the silver sugar dredger 
on one s\(\r- of it (towards the loot of the 
table), near it two decanters of wine ; a 
tumbler and wineglass to each person. At 
luncheon the meat or rliickens. tarts, bis- 
cuits, cake. &c.. arc all put on the table at 
the same time, but if a hot puddmg is 
served the footman bniic^s it in afterwards 
when requited. The footman should be 
ready to push in the chair on which a lady 
scats herself ai she sits down. He carries 
round the luncheon plate-i once, and then 
noes to early dinner (unless there should be 
a luncheon party). He takes the luncheon 
away. He lays the dinner either k la Russe 
or in the English fashion. On the side- 
board before dinner he must arrange the 
plate, glass. &c.. so that he may have every- 
thing re.ndy to his hand. The dessert (unless 
it is a dinner ti la Russe) must be put ready 
on the sideboaid, and the wine decanted ; 
the butler (\i there is one) will look to the 
plate and wine. On each dessert-plate he 
must put a doyley and fingcrglass (some 
people. East Indians especially, like a bay- 
leaf put at the bottom of the water), and 
the silver knife and fork, or if the (inger- 
glasses or wine coolers are left from dinner 
on the table, he puts the wineglasses on the 
plate. Then he must put the butlers tray 
ready. The tablecloth should be laid very 
evenly (slips are laid down each side fur 
company). At each end of the table he 
should place a carving knife and fork and 
their rests; the same before any side-dish 
lequiring it (such us bacon or tongue), a 
table-^poon at each dish's destined place. A 
large knife, two large forks, and a dessert- 
spoon bv each plate, the si>oon for soup, the 
f.\tra fork for tish, where fish knives and 
forks are not used. At each corner of the 
table he puts salt-ct liars, with a tablespoon 
on each side, the bowls in opposite direc- 
tions ; places tt water-bottle and glass at 
each corner ; a plate to each person with a 
nicely folded table-napkin on it. holding a 
dinner roll. If laying for a large partv he puts 
« salt-cellar and a water bottle and glass be- 
Iween every two p< i-.(ms ; the lamp in the 
centiti of tlie l.ible, or the ^pergne as re- 
quired. The lootmau receives the dishes at 
tlie dining-room door ; the butler puts the 
first dish upon the table; the footman 
stands behind the lady. He carries round 

Elates of soup, offering one to each person ; 
e miut hand it ca the U/t hand of the 



diner, and with his own left hind. Next ho 
hands the soup, then the fish, next tin- 
cntrt'es or side-dishes, then the removes or 
chief joints, &c. Wine is offered direcilv 
after soup, and frequently during dinner ; 
sherry is used at the ordinary t.ible. Sh<rry 
after soup and fi^h at a dinner party, then 
immediately afterwards Champatjne or 
Hock, or any lit;ht wine. The footmnu 
must stand w.itching the table very altni- 
tivcly. so th.at he may change every plate as 
soon as n quired. On every clean pl.ite 
handed th::s. he lays a clean silver foik. 
The soup ..die is always removed and put 
into the b-L-liet for the used silver, before the 
tureen is taken away. The carving knife 
and fork are also removed separately. The 
second course is brought in ; the game m 
handed first ; afterwards the sweets, changing 
the plates as required. He must be careful 
to learn from the cook which are the right 
sauces to hand with the different dishes. 

Cheese, butter, &c., arc next served, and 
handed round. 

When dinner is over he removes the slips 
if it is a dinner party, or the cloth only if 
the family are alone. He brushes off the 
crumbs into a small waiter ; inits the desscit 
and wine on the table, and to each person a 
dessert-plate (already prepared) and two 
wineglasses. The fruit is handed round ; 
then^the footman makes up the fire and 
leaves the room. 

He then (wliere no butler is kept) proceeds 
to the drawing room and attends to the fire 
and lamps ; then, in the butler's pantry, he 
washes up the plate ready for cleaning the 
next day. After the ladies have left the 
dining-room he carries in coffee to them ; 
and some time after he takes it into the 
dining-room to the gentlemen. 

When the gentlemen go into the drawing- 
room, he carries in the tea. At the usual 
hour he brings the bedroom candles. These 
minor arrangements, however, differ in dif- 
ferent families. 

The footman brings in letters and notes ; 
he must always hand them on a waiter. 
He must answer bells readily, especially the 
door bell, and he should speak civilly to 
visitors. He shows thein in. asks the name 
if he does not know it, and takes care to 
announce them properly. 

The footman should endeavour by careful 
observation and pains to fit himself for the 
place of undcr-butler.

356 Duties of the Valet and the Butler. — Sen^ants' Characters. 



The Valet. 

Tlie valet's duty is to wait on his master. 

lie sees flint the f^enileman's dressinij- 
roonr fire is lii^hlcd in tlie nioriiiiifTI arranges 
till' clothes, whicii he h.is brushed, cu a 
tat<lf or cliair, and placis the hncn before 
the fire. 1 hen he fills the bath, &c. Some- 
times the valet shaves his master ; ho 
brushes his hair, and should be able to cut 
it every forlniKht. He hands the ganuciits 
required to the Renlleman. 

'Hie valet then receives his orders for the 
day, puts tliedressinR-room straight, brushes 
chuhes, and cleans combs and bruslus ; he 
takes rnessatjes, posts letters, and is at his 
mabtcrb orders vs hencvcr retjuircil. 

The Butler. 

The butler is at the head of the men scr- 



vanis ; he has e; 

He sees t!r : 
laid by tlie for. 
the urn, iSrc. 

Helook^... 
waits at it till liv: 



of the plate antl wine. 

breakfast-table is uell 
, and thai ho brings in 



. : yintj of luncheon, and 
;,nnily are helped; heoflers 
wine or ale, and then leaves the dininp- 
room and j;oes to dinner, if desireil, he 
waits when there is company ; but few [ler- 
sons like to have the bcrvunts wailing' at 
luncheon. 

He gives out nnd arranges the silver for 
dinner, announces dinner, and stands re- 
spectfully at the door till the family go into 
the dininij-room ; sets the first dish on the 
table ; then he takes his place behind his 
master on the left hand, near the sideboard, 
alter removing the cover and handing it to 
the footman. He waits at table with general 
.supervision over the other servants. When 
the boiip and fish are done with, he rings 
the bell for the removes, gives the dishes to 
the footman, receives the removes and places 
them on the table. He removes the covirs, 
and again st.inds near the ^ ilehoartl, unless 
he is re(iuir(,(l to assist in iiaiiding the en- 
trees, wliicli he must do it dicie is only a 
second man to wait. 

lie places the dessert also on the table and 
hands it round. If it iswinUT In- i. ikes care 
to h.ive the hie madi; up j then he leaves the 
room with the luuiman. 



He visits the drawing-room, sees that the 
upper-housemaid has set it to rights while 
tlie family were dressing, makes up the fire, 
sees to the lamps, &c. 

He brings in the tea. At bed-lime he ap- 
pears with the candles. He secures tiie 
iioUbC, and sees that the fires and lights are 
out. 

Brewing, racking, and bottling malt liquors 
— fining down and bottling wine, are duties 
which belong to him. In families where no 
groom of the chambers is kept, he should 
look occasionally into the drawing-room to 
see that the blinds are down if the sun pours 
in, &c. 8ic., and to pay any htUc aitetition to 
the comfort of the lady. 

The butler also, when only a footman is 
kept, answi ;s the hall door with the latter, 
and announces visitors. He is also ready 
when the carriage drives round to assist the 
lady of the house into it, and he is at hand 
when slie returns. 

The duties of a butler single-handed arft 
of course heavy ; if an undci-buller is kept 
they arc lighter. 



SEBVANTS' CHABACTEBS. 

A master or mistress is not hound to give 
a servant a character. If a character is given 
it must be a true one, but if not a good one, 
care should be exercised in the wording, 
particularly if it is a written one, because it 
may be actionable.* If any master or mis- 
tress give a false character of a servant in 
writing, knowing the same to be false, and the 
servant unfit for a situation from dishonesty, 
drunkenness, &c., they render themselves 
liable to a penalty of 20/. and \os. costs. 

If any person personates a master or mis- 
tress, and gives the character of a servant, 
they are liable to be fined 20/. and \os. costs. 

A servant altering a written character or 
bringing a false one— from a person repre- 
senting the master or mistress— is liable to 
loifcit 20/. and \os. costs upon being con- 
victed of such offence. 

* If a bad ch.-ir.icter is piven throut;h vialin
