INTRODUCTION ""RAW 

AT the time of the publication of my first work, "The Table," in 
1889, my duties and responsibilities at Delmonico's were such that I 
was only able to write at irregular intervals, and so the book was neces- 
sarily somewhat hurried and contained many reference numbers. It, 
however, was remarkably successful, through the kind and generous 
support of the public, for which I am profoundly grateful. 

This new work, "The International Cook Book," is the result of 
years of preparation. No efforts were spared in seeking information 
from every source. A leave of absence for several months was obtained 
from my superiors of the International Navigation Company, a tour of 
the world was made, and personal visits paid to hotels, restaurants and 
homes of all countries. Indeed, I have been continually gathering 
new material and travelling for the past decade, and the work is truly 
international in its scope. It certainly is more thorough and complete 
than any work of its kind to date, containing in all over 3,000 recipes, 
each giving full directions. 

It was the many inquiries of acquaintances in regard to dishes I had 
provided and the friendly suggestions that I should get up a collection 
of my recipes that first showed me the demand for a reliable book pointing 
the way to wholesome and nourishing meals. Things of considerable 
interest in the line of catering were found throughout my travels, as is 
attested by the recipes, and my only regret is not having undertaken the 
trip many years earlier. 

Japan, for instance, w r as quite a source of information for valuable 
ways of preparing curries and for excellent fish soups. The advancement 
made in that country was shown by the employment in Tokio, Kyoto 
and Yokohama of experienced managers who had gained their knowl- 
edge of the business in America, England and France. 

From the higher-class restaurants of China have been brought ideas 
for stews for instance, Bami Honkongroise which as modified make 
tasty dishes. Special inquiries have been made about some of these 
dishes by people who have eaten them as prepared under my direction 
without realising that they were Oriental dishes. They have been 
modified for the American taste, as all these adopted from Eastern 
countries are made too rich as prepared in the native homes. The 
Chinese have ways of picking birds so finely by the use of a wet towel 
that they look as though they had been shaved, and have a number of 
good ideas in using macaroni and in the preparation of bacon, ducklings, 
etc. In seasoning, too, the Chinese have original ideas. They take 
slices of ham, perhaps, put it over a range or near the fire, char it, then 
pound it to powder, and it gives an excellent taste when used as seasoning.

vi IN TROD UCTION Continued 

Menus for an entire day's meals as prepared in a high-class Chinese 
home are given in No. 3317. 

At Penang I found a number of good dishes, particularly curries of 
prawns and shrimps. At Macao, near Canton, the Portuguese have 
established quite an industry in dried fish, a trade which the Japanese 
also are developing. Fish of various kinds are split, cleaned and spread 
out on immense nets upon the ground, dried in the sun, salted, and 
then packed in barrels and used for boiling, for soups, etc. This industry 
is still in its infancy in the United States. 

The Celestials prepare whole lambs, pigs, large geese or ducklings 
on a spit, barbecue-like, and then use them in portions or slices as 
required. 

In the zealous search for knowledge of the kitchen in China, the 
writer had several very narrow escapes from the violence of suspicious 
Boxers. Not having been warned as to how dangerous it is for a traveller 
to enter Canton unaccompanied by a native guide, I boldly made my 
way through the old city early one morning. Beginning with rude 
nudges from passers-by, the indignities increased until I was followed by 
an 1 increasing horde, and then through the narrow passages I hurried 1 , 
occasionally warding off an assailant. My curiosity had evidently led 
them to take me for a war-tax collector, and when I eluded them finally 
and got to the European quarters much surprise was expressed that I 
had ventured there alone and had been able to get away. 

I had been advised of the high class of dishes served in the Chinese 
gambling quarters of Singapore, and while there a friendly warning voice 
from a house across the way came when I was again in danger. 

As a warning to travellers to China and Japan, the danger of eating 
fresh vegetables there should be referred to. The fever so easily con- 
tracted results from the night soil that is used for fertilising, and so 
many cases have developed that the Hong Kong board of health has 
had to compel restaurant proprietors to put notices on their bills of fare 
that fresh vegetables were not allowed to be served, imported canned 
vegetables from the Pacific coast being served instead. 

In Manila curried rice is eaten three times a day, much as in 
China, and Spanish dishes and customs have also been widely introduced. 
India provided ideas for curried eggs, curried vegetables, prawns and 
other fish with rice. Indian cooks are clever and can turn out excellent 
native dishes, which are better appreciated if one is not present to see 
them prepared. Meat as a rule is eaten directly after the cattle are 
killed, rendering the meat sinewy, tasteless and exceedingly coarse. 

Papaya, a sort of mango, is a fruit that furnishes a great treat to the 
visitor to Bombay. It is very much in use for the cure of indigestion. 
Eaten just after a meal it gives remarkable relief to the sufferer, which I 
observed, as I had been on too steady a rice diet. 

In Alexandria and Cairo the great consumption of cucumbers was 
interesting, and they were to be seen growing to the size of two and a 
half feet and over. The people save the liquor from them, and it is used 
by the women as a face lotion for the complexion. 



INTRODUCTION Continued vii 

Greece and Turkey have quite a number of excellent native dishes, 
but somewhat too rich, as a good deal of oil is used for cooking in place 
of butter. Both countries produce plenty of excellent vegetables and 
a variety of fine, delicious fruits. Quite a number of recipes for native 
dishes of both countries will be found in the book. 

Bucharest, Roumania and Buda Pesth are about the same as Vienna 
in their cooking and eating customs, while both Vienna and Berlin are 
much on the order of Paris. Eating customs, like the mail systems 
and standards of money, become more universal as travel and trade 
bind the countries more closely. 

"Highlander" is one of the recipes representative of Scotland; 
Holland, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Russia are well represented, as 
also my native country, Switzerland. In Russia many fine varieties of 
fish are served, and at some of the large hotels ornamental tanks are 
constructed in the dining rooms so that the live fish may be observed 
swimming about and selected by patrons to be caught and cooked to 
order, while quantities of cold cooked fish decorated all around are 
arranged on dishes in show cases. Thus the patrons desiring to have 
fresh fish may select it either alive or from the cases. 

One point of information that I sought after carefully was in regard 
to how curry powder was made. There are as many ways of preparing 
it as there are dialects in China. Up to this day the powder has inva- 
riably been too sharp or heating, and I wanted to improve it in this 
respect, so experimented and finally discovered a powder that unques- 
tionably surpasses any other in existence in mildness, taste and per- 
fection, as explained in No. 3318. 

The memoranda for the meals of each day in the year are through- 
out carefully calculated to be sufficient in quantity for six people, as the 
amount can easily be increased or diminished from this average. For 
instance, where nine are to be provided for increase the quantity one- 
half, and double the quantity if for twelve persons. Or, on the con- 
trary, use proportionately half the quantity if for three persons only. 
Full explanations are given for each recipe, without references, except 
where one is repeated in those later on and referred back to. 

The articles on the daily menus are not supposed to be followed in 
their entirety, but to give a wide field to select from. 

With such a book handy there need be no perplexity in deciding 
what to have, or doubt as to what is in season, when called upon to 
entertain a party of friends. In such a case, by turning to the menus 
of the day on which you wish to entertain, everything to be had in the 
market will be seen immediately from the "memoranda," as the recipes 
for the entire year are arranged according to what is in season ; that is, 
any articles on the menus are to be had for the date mentioned. 

No exact dates are given to the bills of fare for each day. 

The new year beginning on a different day of the week from year 
to year, the dates become confusing in succeeding years. To facilitate 
keeping track of the days of each month the following system is adopted 
at the head of the menus.

THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

January ist (supposedly Friday) 
BREAKFAST 

Stewed Prunes 

Oatmeal and Cream 

Shirred Eggs, with Tomato 

Fish Cakes 

Broiled Sirloin Steaks, Maitre d'Hotel 

French Fried Potatoes 

Wheat Cakes 

i. STEWED PRUNES 

One pound fine prunes, half pint cold water, half pint claret, half a 
stick cinnamon, four ounces granulated sugar, two bay leaves, the rind 
of a small sound lemon. 

Place the prunes in a vessel with two quarts of cold water to soak 
for twelve hours. Thoroughly drain and place them in a saucepan 
with all the above articles. Cover the pan and let boil very gently on 
the range for thirty minutes. Remove the pan from the fire, pour into 
a glass or stone jar, and let it get cold. When serving discard bay 
leaves, cinnamon and lemon peel. As stewed prunes should always 
be served cold, a larger quantity can be prepared and kept in a covered 
glass or stone jar, for they will keep in good condition for several days. 

2. OATMEAL PORRIDGE 

One-half pound oatmeal, one-half pint cold milk, one pint cold 
water, one-half teaspoon salt. Place the water, milk and salt in a 
saucepan and let come to a boil, then add the oatmeal and slowly boil 
for twenty-five minutes, lightly stirring occasionally to prevent burning 
at the bottom. Pour it into a hot dish and serve with cold cream or 
cold milk and powdered sugar separately. 

3. EGGS WITH TOMATO 

Lightly butter the bottom of six individual shirred-egg dishes, care- 
fully break two fresh eggs into each dish, taking care to keep the yolks 
intact. Equally season the eggs with half a teaspoon salt and two 
saltspoons white pepper. Cook them for one minute on the range, 
then place them in the oven for five minutes. Remove from the oven, 
pour the tomatoes, prepared as hereunder, over the eggs of each dish, 
evenly divided, and immediately serve.

4 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

4. TOMATOES FOR EGGS, OMELETTES, ETC. 

Select six medium, red, fresh but not too ripe tomatoes, plunge 
them in boiling water for one minute, lift them up with a skimmer, then 
with a towel carefully skin them. Trim off the stems and cut them 
into even quarters. Heat a teaspoon melted butter in a small saucepan, 
add two sound, peeled, finely chopped shallots and gently brown them 
for half a minute, then pour in one and a half tablespoons white wine, 
lightly mix, add the tomatoes with half a teaspoon freshly chopped 
parsley. Season with a level teaspoon salt, half a teaspoon sugar and 
two saltspoons white pepper, lightly mix, cover the pan and let cook 
for twelve minutes, carefully stirring once in a while. 

Mix on a saucer a teaspoon butter with half a teaspoon flour, then 
add it to the tomatoes, gently mix, and the tomatoes will be ready to 
use as directed. 

5. FISH CAKES 

Soak one-half pound boneless codfish in cold water for sixteen 
hours, changing the water three times during that interval. Drain, 
place it in a saucepan again with cold water and let boil for five minutes; 
drain and carefully pick out all the little bones from the cod. Pass it 
through a chopping machine or pound it in a mortar. 

Have one pound cooked, peeled potatoes. Press them through a 
sieve. Add the fish to the potatoes. Break in two whole raw eggs, add 
a saltspoon ground English mustard, a saltspoon grated nutmeg, two 
saltspoons white pepper and one and a half teaspoons anchovy sauce. 
Mix the whole thoroughly in a bowl with a wooden spoon for three 
minutes. 

Sprinkle two tablespoons flour on a table. Spread the preparation 
nicely over the flour and divide it into six equal parts ; neatly roll them 
in the flour, giving them nice cake forms. 

Heat one ounce butter or good fat in a frying pan, drop in the cakes 
and fry for three minutes on each side, or until of a good golden colour. 
Remove them with a cake turner and drain well. Dress on a hot dish 
with a napkin and serve very hot. 

6. BROILED SIRLOIN STEAKS, MA!TRE D'HOTEL 

Have two fine, tender sirloin steaks of one pound and a quarter 
each. Flatten them evenly and nicely with a cleaver. Pour a table- 
spoon good oil on a plate, turn the steaks in the oil several times, then 
season with a teaspoon salt and a light teaspoon white pepper, evenly 
divided all over. Arrange them on a broiler and broil them on a brisk 
charcoal fire for six minutes on each side. Remove, dress on a hot 
dish; spread the maitre d '"hotel butter (No. 7) over the steaks and 
serve as rapidly as possible. 

7. MA!TRE D'HOTEL BUTTER 

Have on a cold plate three-quarters of an ounce good table butter, 
half a teaspoon well-washed, thoroughly dried and finely chopped 



FRIDAY, JANUARY FIRST 5 

parsley, one-quarter teaspoon of ditto chervil (cerfeuil), half a tea- 
spoon juice from a sound lemon, one saltspoon salt, and a half salt- 
spoon white pepper. Mix the whole well together with a fork and use 
when required. 

N. B. This maitre d 'hotel butter should always be kept in a cool 
place until required. 

8. FRENCH FRIED POTATOES 

Peel, clean and cut into pieces one-half inch square and two and a 
half inches long four good-sized sound potatoes. Wash well in cold 
water and drain thoroughly. 

Have some boiling fat in a frying pan; plunge in the potatoes and 
fry for ten minutes, being very sure that the fat is thoroughly boiling 
before the potatoes are plunged in. Lift up with a skimmer, lay on a 
dish ; let rest for one minute, replace in the boiling fat and fry for three 
minutes more; lift up with a skimmer, lay on a kitchen towel and dry 
thoroughly. Sprinkle the equivalent of a teaspoon of salt over them, 
dress on a hot dish and serve. 

French fried sweet potatoes are prepared exactly the same way, and 
both should be promptly served after having been prepared. 

9. WHEATEN CAKES 

One-quarter pound flour, one raw egg, one-half ounce powdered 
sugar, one-quarter ounce baking powder, one-half pint cold milk and a 
saltspoon salt.

Procure two fine, tender spring chickens of one and a quarter pounds 
each. Singe and cut off the legs at the first joints (keeping them 
for soup stock). Remove the back, split through the spine, begin- 
ning at the neck, totally removing the spine with neck. Neatly draw. 
Remove the breast bones, wipe them with a towel and nicely flatten them 
with a cleaver. 

Place one-half tablespoon oil on a flat dish with a teaspoon salt and 
two saltspoons white pepper; turn the chicken several times in the 
seasoning. Arrange them on a clean double broiler, and broil on a 
brisk fire for eight minutes on each side. Remove. Have six pieces 
of fresh toast on a hot dish; dress the chicken on the toast. 

Equally spread a maitre d'hotel butter, prepared as per No. 6, over 
the chicken. Arrange twelve slices of freshly broiled bacon (No. 13) 
over them and serve. 

13. BROILED BACON 

With a keen knife cut the under bones off a fine breakfast bacon; 
pare both edges, also the end (opposite side to the string end, which is 



FRIDAY, JANUARY FIRST 7 

used to hang it up). With a sharp knife cut the necessary number of 
slices for immediate use. To have it crispy and tasty, thin slices are 
always preferable, both for broiling and frying. Always cut them 
crosswise, never lengthwise. Arrange the slices on a broiler, and broil 
on a moderate fire for two minutes on each side ; dress on a hot dish and 
serve immediately. 

For frying fry for two minutes on each side, in a frying pan with a 
little hot fat. Bacon should always be kept by the string in a dry, cool 
place; never on the ice. 

14. BAKED SWEET POTATOES 

Select six good-sized, sound sweet potatoes. Slightly trim off both 
ends, wipe and place them on a tin plate, baking in the hot oven for 
forty-five minutes and turning trrm over every ten minutes. Remove

minutes. Remove and thoroughly drain. 

Then place in a sautoire with a good tablespoon butter, a saltspoon 
salt, a good saltspoon white pepper and a light saltspoon grated nut- 
meg. Toss gently on the fire for four minutes. Add a light half-pint 
hot tomato sauce (No. 16), gently mix with a fork, then add two ounces 
grated Parmesan or Swiss cheese and mix well again with the fork for 
one minute longer. Dress on a hot dish and serve. 

1 6. TOMATO SAUCE 

Two ounces butter, four ounces lean, raw ham, cut into small 
pieces, two sliced carrots, two sliced onions, one chopped leek, two 
branches chopped parsley, a branch chopped celery, two cloves, one 
teaspoon whole peppers, one-half sprig bay leaf, one-half ditto thyme,

tomatoes cut into quarters (or two quarts canned), four tablespoons 
flour, one tablespoon salt and a light tablespoon powdered sugar. 

Place all the above articles, except the flour and tomatoes, in a large 
saucepan ; set it on a brisk fire. Mix well with a wooden spoon and let 
cook for twelve minutes, or until of a good brown colour, lightly mixing 
meanwhile. Add the flour, mix well, cook for five minutes, then add 
the quartered tomatoes and one quart cold water. Mix thoroughly; 
cover the pan and let boil very slowly for one hour and a half, mixing 
once in a while. Strain through a sieve into a vessel, then strain again 
through a cheesecloth into another vessel. Use the amount required 
and place the remaining tomato sauce (after having been cooled off) in 
bottles; cork them well and always keep in a cool place for future use. 
This important sauce being of such general use, and at times required 
only in a very small quantity, it would be advisable for convenience to 



8 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

prepare in larger amount than is required each time, as it will keep in 
perfect condition for a long time. 

17. FRENCH PANCAKES 

Four ounces sifted flour, half ounce powdered sugar, two whole raw 
eggs, one saltspoon salt, three-quarters pint good cold milk, eight drops 
vanilla essence, four drops orange flavouring and a tablespoon Jamaica 
rum. 

Place the flour in a vessel, break in the eggs, add the sugar, salt, 
essences and the milk gradually. With a wire whisk briskly beat up 
the whole together for five minutes, or until thoroughly thickened. 
Then pass it through a Chinese strainer into another small vessel and 
let stand for thirty minutes. Have a tablespoon melted butter on a 
saucer. Have a small frying pan, six inches in diameter at the bottom, 
lightly greased with the butter by means of a small hair pastry brush. 
When the bottom of the pan is thoroughly hot pour the equivalent of 
three tablespoons of the preparation into the pan (at once) and fry on a 
brisk fire till of a nice golden colour which will take about a minute 
turn it over and fry exactly the same. Be very careful not to allow the 
cakes to get black. Carefully turn the cake on a hot plate on the corner 
of the range. Proceed to make eleven more exactly the same way. 
Lightly dredge with fine sugar the one on top, roll it up nicely and 
dredge just a little more sugar over. Lay it on a hot dish. Proceed 
the same way with the others and serve very hot.

1 8. OYSTERS 

Oysters should be kept in a cold place and thoroughly washed before 
they are opened. They should be opened on the deep shell, so as to 
better preserve the liquor, then placed on finely chopped ice for a short 
time too long destroys their flavour. While they should be kept as cold 
as possible, they should never be allowed to freeze, therefore they must 
only be opened shortly before they are needed; for once frozen they 
quickly turn sour. The proper way to open them is to place the deep 
shell in the palm of the left hand and break them on one side. The 
Boston stabbing knife is preferable for this, but if there be none handy 
use a small block that the oysters can fit into and stab it on the edge; 



FRIDAY, JANUARY FIRST g 

or even a chopping block and chopping knife may be employed in case 
of necessity.

of brown paper the full size of the bottom of the pan. Then gently press 
the preparation down into the papered pan, one inch in diameter, 
taking care that each is entirely separated from the others. Take a 
damp towel and drop it gently on the macaroons, so as to shape them 
perfectly. Place the pan in a rather slow oven and bake for twenty 
minutes, so they will obtain a good golden colour. Remove from the 
oven and let them cool. To remove them easily from the paper, wet 
part of a table, lay the paper over this for two minutes, detach them, 
dress on a dish and serve. Place in jar or tin those not needed, as they 
will keep in good condition for 'several days.

juice of half a sound lemon. Toss them gently while warming for five 
minutes. Place them on a hot dish and serve. 

64. LEG OF LAMB, JARDINIERE 

Have a nice, tender, rather small leg of lamb. Trim the handle 
bone neatly. Rub half ounce butter or good fat all over it. Season 
with a light tablespoon salt and a teaspoon white pepper well 
distributed. Place it in a roasting pan. Pour four tablespoons 
cold water into the pan and roast in the oven for one hour, basting it 
once in a while. Remove it from the oven, dress on a hot dish, skim 
off the fat from the gravy and strain the gravy over the meat. Dress 
the jardiniere all around the leg and serve. 

65. JARDINIERE 

With a small vegetable scoop dig out two medium-sized carrots and 
one good-sized turnip. Place them in a saucepan with a pint water 
and two saltspoons salt and let cook until soft, about thirty minutes. 
Drain the vegetables on a sieve and see that they are thoroughly dry. 
Put them back in the same saucepan with a light tablespoon butter, 
adding three tablespoons canned green peas, three tablespoons canned 
string beans cut into half-inch pieces, half a teaspoon fine sugar and a 
light saltspoon grated nutmeg. Mix all well together with a wooden 
spoon without mashing the vegetables, let slowly cook on the corner 
of the range for five minutes, and it will be ready for use. A piece of 
cauliflower and two tablespoons asparagus tips, cut into small pieces, 
and a few very small Brussels sprouts, all cooked separately, can be 
added to the jardiniere, if at hand. 



SATURDAY, JANUARY SECOND 21 

66. FRIED APPLES 

Peel and core three large, good, sound apples. Slice them into 
slices half an inch thick. Dip them in cold milk, then roll them in flour. 
Melt one-half ounce butter in a frying pan. Place the apples in the 
pan and fry on a brisk fire until a nice golden colour on both sides, or 
two minutes for each side. Remove them with a skimmer and dress 
on a hot dish with a folded napkin. Besprinkle with a little powdered 
sugar and serve. 

67. ROAST TURKEY, CRANBERRY SAUCE 

Procure a nice, tender turkey of about eight pounds. Remove the 
three sinews in each leg of the turkey by making an incision with a small, 
sharp knife on the under part, beginning one inch above the first leg 
joint and cutting upward for two inches right alongside the bone. Turn 
up the skin, then insert a small ice pick beneath the sinews and twist 
around until cleanly drawn, but only draw out one at a time. Remove the 
neck and cut the legs off one inch from the first joint. Singe, draw, wipe 
dry; truss with a needle from the wing to the leg. Season with a table- 
spoon salt, well sprinkled all over, and a light teaspoon white pepper. 
Cover the breasts with thin slices of larding pork. Lay the bird on a 
roasting pan, pour into the pan four tablespoons cold water. Place in 
the oven to roast for one hour and twenty minutes, being careful to baste 
it frequently with its own gravy while roasting, and turning it around once 
in a while to let get a good colour all over. Remove it from the oven, 
untruss and dress on a hot dish. Carefully skim the fat from the gravy, 
then strain the gravy over the turkey and serve with cranberry sauce in a 
bowl separately. 

68. CRANBERRY SAUCE 

One pound sound red cranberries, one pound granulated sugar, 
half pint cold water. Wash the berries in plenty of cold water and care- 
fully pick them, rejecting all those that float on top of the water, over- 
ripe or spoiled. Place them in an enamelled saucepan with half a pint 
cold water, and as soon as the water comes to a boil add the sugar; mix 
well with a wooden spoon and let gently boil for thirty minutes, mashing 
the berries as much as possible with the wooden spoon while cooking. 
Remove the pan from the fire, let the sauce get thoroughly cold, and 
always serve in a saucebowl separately. 

N. B. The above amount of cranberry sauce will be considerably 
more than required for this occasion, therefore whatever is left over 
should be placed in a jelly jar, tightly covered and kept in a cool place, 
as it will keep in excellent condition for several months. A larger quan- 
tity than the above can be prepared if so desired. 

69. CELERY SALAD, MAYONNAISE 

Pare off the green stalks and neatly trim the roots from two small 
stalks of white, crisp celery. Thoroughly wash, drain well, then cut 
into quarter-inch pieces. Dry well on a clean cloth, place in a salad 
bowl and season with two tablespoons dressing (as per No. 863). Mix 



22 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

well, and, just a minute before sending it to the table, add three table- 
spoons mayonnaise to the celery; mix it well and serve. 

70. MAYONNAISE SAUCE 

Place one fresh egg yolk in a small bowl with one tablespoon good 
vinegar, one saltspoon ground English mustard, two saltspoons salt and a 
saltspoon cayenne pepper. Briskly beat up the whole together with a wire 
whisk for two minutes, then add, drop by drop, three-quarters of a gill good 
cool olive oil, continually mixing while adding it, and continue mixing for 
four minutes after the oil has been added ; add the juice of one-quarter 
of a sound lemon, mix for one minute more, then use when required. 

Place the surplus of the mayonnaise in a cup and put in a cold place, 
as it will keep in good condition for two or three days. 

71. CABINET PUDDING 

Lightly butter the interior of a one quart pudding mould. Arrange 
a small piece of white paper to cover the bottom of the mould. Cut 
out from a sandwich loaf of bread thirty round pieces one inch in diame- 
ter and one-third inch in thickness. Beat up in a bowl two raw egg 
yolks with a tablespoon powdered sugar and one gill cream or good milk. 
Steep the pieces of bread in the cream for ten minutes. Chop very fine 
six small slices of candied or canned pineapple and fifteen peeled pis- 
taches. Mix them together, arrange a layer of the bread at the bottom 
of the mould, then a layer of pineapples, etc. Continue the same 
operation until all are used, seeing that the last is a layer of bread. 
Gradually fill the mould up to the height of the bread with a custard (as 
per No. 37). Place in a saucepan and pour in boiling water up to 
half the height of the mould. Place in a moderate oven to bake 
for one hour. Remove, unmould, dress on a hot dish, and serve with a 
hot pineapple sauce. 

72. PINEAPPLE SAUCE 

Heat in a saucepan one and a half gills canned pineapple liquor with 
half gill granulated sugar and a small piece lemon peel (one quarter).

milk. Sharply mix the whole with a fork for two minutes. Place in a 
black frying pan one good tablespoon clarified butter, and when the but- 
ter crackles drop in the eggs and with a fork stir well for two minutes, 
then let rest for half a minute. Fold up with the fork the side nearest 
the handle first to the centre of the omelette, then the opposite side, 
so that both sides will meet right in the centre ; let rest for half minute. 
Have a hot dish in the left hand, take hold of the handle of the pan with 
the right, bring both dish and pan to a triangular shape, and with a 
rapid movement turn the omelette over the centre of the dish and imme- 
diately send to the table. Always make the omelettes on a brisk fire 
without taking the lid off.

open through the back, neatly draw and wipe dry six nice fat Phila- 
delphia squabs. Remove the breast bones and lightly flatten with 
a cleaver. Place them on a dish, season with a teaspoon salt and 
half teaspoon white pepper, well divided all over. 

Heat two tablespoons melted lard in a large frying pan, lay in the 
squabs one beside another, and gently fry them for eight minutes 
on each side. Remove; pour a hot piquante sauce, prepared as per No. 
177, on a hot dish. Dress the squabs over the sauce, one overlapping 
another, and send to the table. 

84. POTATOES, ANNA 

Peel, wash and drain four good-sized, sound, raw potatoes. Slice

them as fine as possible. Grate two ounces Parmesan or Swiss cheese. 
Heat one ounce butter in a small frying pan, remove the pan from the 
fire and cover the bottom with a light layer of potatoes. Mix a teaspoon 
salt with two saltspoons white pepper, sprinkle a very little over the 
potatoes, spread a very little of the cheese over the potatoes, and 
place a few little bits of butter over the cheese. Arrange another 
layer of potatoes and so on till all are employed. Cover the pan 
and place on a moderate fire for five minutes. Turn them over 
with a cake turner; let them cook again for three minutes and then 
place in the hot oven for ten minutes. Remove them from the oven.

85. OMELETTE SOUFFLE" E, VANILLA 

Lightly butter and then dredge a little powdered sugar on the bottom 
of a rather deep, cold-metal or china dish, about twelve inches long by 
nine wide, that will stand the heat. Place in a vessel three ounces pow- 
dered sugar. Carefully break seven fresh eggs, drop the whites into a 
copper basin, and the yolks of four into the vessel containing the sugar. 
Crush as finely as you can three macaroons (as per No. 43), add them 
to the sugar and yolks, then with a whisk begin to beat the yolks, sugar 
and macaroons as briskly as you possiby can for twelve minutes, then 
lay aside. 

Then, if handy, place the copper basin on some ice, and with the 
whisk beat up to a very stiff froth the seven whites in the copper basin, 
which will take about twelve minutes. Remove the whisk, then (with 



26 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

a skimmer in the right hand) with the left take hold of the vessel con- 
taining the preparation of yolk, sugar and macaroons and gradually 
pour it over the whites. Season with a light saltspoon salt and pour in 
ten drops good vanilla essence; gently mix the whole well together for 
two minutes with the whisk, or until thoroughly incorporated. Now 
take up the preparation with the skimmer and drop it into the centre of 
the buttered, sugared dish, taking special care to pile it as high as 
possible, so as to have it of a perfect dome-shape; with the blade of a 
knife make an opening on top two inches and a half long by two and a 
half in depth and one and a half inch wide. Turn the preparation, 
from the centre of the opening over on each side, heaping it a little higher 
at each end of the opening. Neatly smooth the sides' and all around 
with the blade of a knife, giving it any desired design to look attractive 
when cooked. 

Heat the bottom of the dish on top of the range for just a minute, 
then place it in a moderate oven to bake for six minutes; remove it to 
the oven door, dredge powdered sugar over it liberally, replace it in the 
oven and bake for six minutes more, or until it has obtained an exceed- 
ingly good golden colour. Remove it from the oven, lay the dish upon 
another cold one and immediately send to the table. 

N. B. Special care should be taken when piling the preparation 
into the dish and making the opening, which should be done as rapidly 
as possible. When desired, the vanilla essence can be substituted by 
orange-flavour water.

28 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

potato masher into a bowl. Season with half teaspoon salt, two salt- 
spoons white pepper, one light teaspoon grated nutmeg, adding two 
whole raw eggs and half ounce butter. Thoroughly mix with the 
wooden spoon for five minutes. Spread two tablespoons flour on a 
corner of the table. Divide the puree into six equal parts. Roll 
them in the flour, giving them a nice brioche form. Place in a 
buttered tin pan, spread a few drops of melted butter over each 
brioche, and bake in the hot oven until of a nice golden colour, or 
eight minutes. Remove from the oven, dress on a hot dish with 
a folded napkin and serve. 

92. CHICKEN VALENCIENNE 

Procure a nice, tender two-and-a-half-pound roasting chicken. Cut 
off the head and feet; singe, draw, wipe dry and truss nicely. Arrange 
a thin border of lard over the breast of the chicken, nicely tied. Peel 
and cut into half-inch square pieces one small, sound Spanish onion, one 
ounce lean raw ham, cut the same way, and one clove sound, chopped 
garlic. Place these in an earthen pot, if possible, sufficiently large to 
hold the chicken. Add one tablespoon good oil. Lay the chicken over 
and place the pot in the hot oven for ten minutes, or till it gets a nice 
light golden colour; then draw the pot to the oven door. Add two gills 
raw Italian rice, four sweet Spanish peppers cut into half-inch squares 
and two tablespoons green peas. Season with a light tablespoon salt, 
half teaspoon white pepper, a very little Spanish saffron (or a saltspoon), 
and one stalk parsley, finely chopped. Moisten with a heavy pint hot 
broth or water and a good gill white wine. Cover the pot and place in 
the oven again to cook for forty-five minutes. Remove from the 
oven, take up the chicken from the pot, dress the rice, etc., on a hot 
dish, arrange the chicken on the rice and send to the table. 

N. B. When drawing poultry of any kind split the gizzards in two, 
then carefully remove the sandy pouch, wash well in clear, cold water 
and add to the white broth "stock pot" (No. 701), as well as the hearts 
and livers. 

93. SPRING- LAMB CHOPS, SOUBISE 

Have six nice spring-lamb chops. Trim and neatly flatten them. 
Season with a teaspoon salt and two saltspoons white pepper. Lightly 
roll in flour, then steep in beaten-up eggs and gently roll in bread crumbs. 

Heat one tablespoon clarified butter in a frying pan; lay the chops 
in the pan, one beside another, and gently fry for five minutes on each 
side. Pour the Soubise sauce on a hot dish. Dress the chops nicely 
over the sauce, one overlaying the other, and serve. 

94. SOUBISE SAUCE 

Chop very fine half a medium, sound white onion; place in a sauce- 
pan with half ounce butter and gently brown on the range for five min- 
utes. Add two teaspoons flour, mix well ; add one good gill boiling milk

egg yolk and mix well without boiling. Strain the s? .ice through a 
cheesecloth over the dish. 

95. FRENCH FLAGEOLETS 

Open a can of French flageolets. Drain and plunge them into 
boiling water for six minutes. Drain again. Place in a saucepan with 
half an ounce good butter, half teaspoon salt, half teaspoon powdered 
sugar and half saltspoon white pepper. Mix well for one minute and 
serve in a hot vegetable dish. 

96. PUNCH, CARDINAL 

Place in a bowl half pound granulated sugar, grate in the rind of half 
a very sound lemon and squeeze in the juice of three medium-sized, 
sound lemons, the juice of half an orange, adding one gill raspberry 
syrup and one and a half pints lukewarm water, two teaspoons Swiss 
kirsch and one teaspoon maraschino. Thoroughly mix with a wooden 
spoon for three minutes, then add four drops vegetable carmine, if handy; 
mix a little. Strain and place it in a small freezer and freeze same as 
vanilla ice cream (No. 42). Fill up six punch glasses and serve. 

97, ROAST PARTRIDGE SUR CANAPES 

Singe, cut off the heads and feet, draw and wipe two fine, young 
fat partridges. Truss them neatly, cover the breasts with a layer of 
thin lard, nicely tied around. Lay them in a roasting pan; pour in three 
tablespoons cold water and roast them in the hot oven for thirty minutes, 
basting the birds occasionally with their own gravy. Remove from the 
oven, suppress the lard, untruss, dress on a hot dish over two bread 
canapes. Decorate the dish with a little watercress. Strain the gravy 
into a saucebowl and serve separately, also serving a little bread sauce 
separately. 

98. CANAPES FOR GAME 

Cut out two canapes from a loaf of American stale bread one and a 
half inches thick. Trim neatly, pare off the crusts; then cut out a piece 
in the centre of each, from end to end, so that the cavity will hold the 
bird nicely when sending to the table. Spread a very little butter over 
them, place on a tin plate, then brown in the hot oven until they obtain 
a good golden colour. Remove and arrange them on a hot dish. 

99. BREAD SAUCE 

Boil half pint milk in a small saucepan, add half teaspoon salt, one 
saltspoon cayenne pepper, one half gill fresh bread crumbs and one tea- 
spoon butter; mix all well together and let boil for six minutes, lightly

Pare off the outer green leaves and cores of two rather small or one 
large head of fine, white, fresh endive. If free from sand and otherwise 



3 o THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

thoroughly clean, carefully wipe it with a cloth without washing, but if 
washing is required, it should be done as rapidly as possible ; that is, as 
soon as it is plunged into the cold water quickly turn it all over with the 
hands, lift it up, let the water run out, then place it in a wire salad basket 
and sharply shake it till thoroughly dry. 

The long leaves can be cut so as to have them all as near equal in size 
as possible. Place in salad bowl. Season with four tablespoons dress- 
ing, as per No. 863 ; thoroughly mix at the last moment and serve. 

101. PUDDING ESPAGNOLE 

Lightly butter the interior of a quart pudding mould. Heat two 
ounces clarified butter in a saucepan, pour in one gill bread crumbs and 
let get a nice golden colour; then add half pint hot milk. Thoroughly 
mix with a wooden spoon till thoroughly thickened, remove the pan 
from the fire and mix well again for five minutes. Add two ounces pow- 
dered sugar, one teaspoon vanilla essence, two whole raw eggs and three 
yolks. Mix well. Now add the whites of the three eggs, beaten to a 
stiff froth. Gently mix again and then fill the mould with the prepara- 
tion. Place the mould in a saucepan, pour hot water up to one-half the 
height of the mould, and bake in the hot oven for thirty minutes. Re- 
move, unmould on a hot dish and serve with a Sabayon sauce (No. 102). 

102. SABAYON SAUCE 

Place in a bowl two egg yolks and one ounce granulated sugar. 
Mix well with a wooden spoon for two minutes. Boil in a saucepan one 
gill milk and one gill cream, adding seven drops vanilla essence ; as soon 
as it comes to a boil pour it very gradually over the eggs and sugar, con- 
tinually stirring meanwhile. Transfer into a saucepan, set the pan on 
the fire, heat for three minutes, without ceasing mixing, but do not allow 
to boil. Remove the pan from the fire. Strain through a cheesecloth 
into a saucebowl and serve. 

103. GLACE CONSTANTINE 

Have a well-cleaned melon mould of one quart, three ounces choco- 
late, three ounces granulated sugar, one pint hot water, half pint cream 
whipped, eight egg yolks and a gill white syrup. Place the chocolate, 
sugar and water in a saucepan on the fire and boil for five minutes, 
continually mixing meanwhile; set the pan on the corner of the range. 
Beat up the egg yolks in a bowl with the cold syrup. Pour, little by 
little, the chocolate preparation into the eggs, constantly mixing with 
the wooden spoon while doing so. Transfer the preparation into the 
same saucepan, set the pan -on the fire, gently mix until it bubbles, but 
do not allow to boil. Remove the pan from the fire and add the whipped 
cream, mix a little; then strain it into the freezer and freeze the same as 
vanilla ice cream (No. 42). Fill the mould with the ice cream and 
close it tightly. Bury the mould in a tub with ice and rock salt and 
let freeze for an hour. Remove, unmould on a cold dish with a folded 
napkin and send to the table.

104. ORANGES 

Peel and carefully detach all fibres adhering to four good-sized, 
sound, juicy, cold oranges. Then with a keen knife cut them crosswise 
into thin, equal slices. Lay them on a dish with all their juice; liberally 
dredge powdered sugar over them. Let stand in a cool place, and just 
before serving pour in a pony of curacao, Swiss kirsch, kummel or cognac. 
Dress them nicely on a dessert dish in crown shape. Thoroughly mix 
the liquor, sugar, etc., pour it over the oranges and serve. 

105. QUAKER OATS 

Place in an enamelled saucepan three-quarters of a pint cold milk, 
half pint cold water and a teaspoon salt and let just come to a boil, then 
add two gills Quaker oats. Lightly mix and let boil rather slowly for 
fully one hour, lightly stirring at the bottom with the wooden spoon 
occasionally to prevent burning at the bottom. Pour into a bowl and 
serve with cold milk or cream. 

106. POACHED EGGS ON TOAST (12 pieces) 

No. i. Have in quite a wide and rather low-edged pan on the fire 
(so that six eggs can easily float at the same time without jamming) 
three and a half quarts of water, seeing that the water is no less than 
four inches deep. 

Have on a dinner plate one tablespoon cold water. When the water 
in the pan boils, pour in one tablespoon vinegar. Carefully crack six 
fresh eggs on the wetted plate, without breaking the yolks, and gently 
slide them into the boiling water and poach for three minutes. Lift 
them up with a skimmer, neatly trim the edges, if there be any adhering; 
lay them on freshly prepared buttered or unbuttered toasts, two eggs on 
each, and keep warm. Repeat the same with six more and serve. By 
not using salt in poaching the eggs they will turn out whiter and more 
brilliant looking. 

No. 2 (12 eggs). Have a pan on the fire with same quantity of water 
as above, with a tablespoon salt and a tablespoon vinegar. Have 
another saucepan on the fire with two quarts boiling water. Carefully 
drop in six fresh eggs and let them just roll over for fourteen seconds; 
lift them up and gently drop in cold water; then repeat same process 
with six more. Lift them up from the cold water and lay on a plate. 



32 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

When the first seasoned water thoroughly boils carefully and rapidly 
crack six of the eggs and drop them right in the centre as near the 
surface of the water as the heat will permit. Poach for three minutes. 
Take them up with the skimmer, neatly trim off any adhering superflu- 
ous edges, lay them on freshly prepared toast, and proceed to prepare 
six more in this manner and serve. 

When the eggs are absolutely fresh the mode of preparing them 
described in No. i is the best. When doubtful, or in winter months, 
No. 2 is the safest. 

107. BOILED SALT MACKEREL 

Cut away the fins and soak in fresh water for two hours a fine, good- 
sized salt mackerel. Drain well and then plunge it into a pan with two 
quarts boiling water and allow to boil for ten minutes. Remove, drain 
well, dress on a hot dish with a folded napkin and serve with a little hot 
melted butter separately. 

1 08. HAMBURG STEAK WITH FRIED ONIONS 

Pass through a Salisbury chopping machine two pounds lean, raw 
rump of beef, lay it on a plate, add one good-sized, finely chopped sound 
onion, first fried in a teaspoon butter for three minutes. Season with 
one teaspoon salt, half teaspoon white pepper, a saltspoon grated nutmeg, 
one tablespoon finely chopped parsley and one whole raw egg. Mix 
all well together, then divide the meat into six equal parts. Roll them 
in flour and give them a nice fish-cake form. Heat three-quarters of an 
ounce butter in a frying pan. Slide in the steaks and fry them for six 
minutes on each side. Remove, drain well, dress on a hot dish, pour 
over their own gravy. Arrange the fried onions around the steak and 
serve very hot. 

109. FRIED ONIONS 

Peel and slice round-shaped four medium-sized, sound white onions. 
Season with half teaspoon salt, detach them at the rings, gently roll 
them in two tablespoons flour, then plunge them in boiling fat and fry 
for eight minutes, or until they obtain a good golden colour. Lift them 
up with a skimmer, lay them on a cloth to dry and use as 
required. 

no. STEWED POTATOES 

Boil five good-sized, sound potatoes in a quart boiling water with a 
teaspoon salt for thirty-five minutes; peel and slice them rather thin. 
Heat half ounce butter in "a saucepan, add one teaspoon flour, mixing 
well. Now add one and a half gills boiling milk and half gill hot cream. 
Mix well with wire whisk. Drop the potatoes into the pan. Season 
with half teaspoon salt, two saltspoons white pepper and one saltspoon 
grated nutmeg, also one-half teaspoon butter. Toss them well and let 
cook for ten minutes. Pour on a hot dish, sprinkle half teaspoon chopped 
parsley over and serve. 



MONDAY, FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY 33 

in. QUEEN CAKES 

Half pound flour, three ounces butter, four ounces powdered sugar, 
two eggs, one gill milk, two tablespoons currants, half teaspoon baking 
powder and the juice of half a sound lemon.

112. OYSTERS A L'!NDIENNE 

Have in a saucepan half pint boiling water. Plunge in twenty-four 
fairly good-sized, freshly opened oysters with all their liquor. Season 
with half teaspoon salt and let boil for five minutes. Drain them and 
add them to the curry sauce (as prepared in No. 54). Let the whole 
boil for three minutes. Arrange a rice as in No. 113 around a hot dish, 
crown shape. Pour the oysters in the centre of the dish and serve. 

113. BOILED RICE 

Clean and wash well quarter of a pound good rice; place it in a 
saucepan with a pint and a half cold water and a teaspoon salt ; put the 
lid on and boil for twenty- two minutes. Drain through a colander, 
being careful to let it drain thoroughly without crushing the rice, other- 
wise it is liable to spoil. Return it to the pan, put the lid on, set it on 
the corner of the range for five minutes and serve as required. 

114. NAVARIN PARMENTIER 

Procure a nice neck of tender mutton. Cut it into two-inch-square 
pieces. Heat two tablespoons good oil in a stewpan, add one clove 
sound garlic and heat on the range until a light brown, then remove the 
garlic from the pan and add the mutton. Season with a teaspoon salt 
and half teaspoon white pepper and gently brown for ten minutes, turning 
the pieces occasionally. Add two tablespoons flour, stir well with the 
wooden spoon. Moisten with one quart hot water, mix well. Cover 
the pan and let it come to a boil. Tie up as a bouquet two leeks, two 
branches parsley, three branches chives and two branches chervil (cer- 
feuil) and add it to the stew. Add also six sound, finely hashed shallots. 
Shift the pan a little aside from the briskness of the fire and let gently 
simmer for forty-five minutes, skimming the fat off the surface two or 



34 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

three times during that time. Then add two good-sized, peeled, raw 
potatoes, cut into one-inch-square pieces, and half pint tomato sauce 
(No. 1 6). Cover the pan and let slowly cook for thirty minutes 
more. Remove the bouquet of herbs. Pour the stew into a hot 
deep dish. Sprinkle half teaspoon freshly chopped parsley over 
and serve. 

115. TOMATO OMELETTE . t 

Break eight fresh eggs into a bowl. Season with one-half teaspoon 
salt and two saltspoons white pepper, adding one-half gill cold milk, and 
beat the whole thoroughly for two minutes. Place in quite a large 
frying pan one heavy tablespoon clarified butter and heat well without 
browning; that is, when the butter crackles, pour in quarter of a pint 
finely chopped, fresh-cooked stewed tomatoes, drawing off all their 
liquor; mix lightly and cook for two minutes; then drop in the beaten 
eggs over the tomatoes and with a fork gently mix the whole for three 
minutes. Let rest for one and a half minutes, fold up the two opposite 
sides, carefully turn into a hot dish and send to the table. 

1 1 6. FRIED SWEET POTATOES 

Peel four medium-sized, sound, round, sweet potatoes. Cut them 
into one-third-inch-thick slices, then cut each slice into one-third-inch 
strips. Plunge them in hot, but not boiling, fat for ten minutes. Lift 
them up with the skimmer. Thoroughly boil the fat, then plunge in the 
potatoes again and fry for three minutes longer. Remove them with the 
skimmer and thoroughly drain on a cloth. Dress on a hot dish with a 
folded napkin and serve. 

117. PASTE FOR ONE PIE 

Sift half pound flour on a table. Make a "fountain" (hollow space) 
in the centre, place into it one and a half ounces butter, one gill cold 
water and one and a half saltspoons salt. Then with the hand mix the 
butter, water and salt briskly for three minutes and gradually and slowly 
incorporate the flour with the rest, mixing for five minutes. Lay the 
paste on a plate, cover it with a towel and place in a cool place to rest 
for a few minutes. Have ready three ounces well-washed butter in a 
lump; return the paste to the table, flatten it lightly, then place the 
lump of butter in the centre, fold over the edges so as to enclose the 
butter, roll it out lengthwise with the pastry roller and refold the 
paste into three folds. Let it rest again in a cool place for three 
minutes; then roll it again, fold it as before and set in the ice box for 
five minutes. 

How to Make the Pie. Cut out half the prepared paste, roll it out 
round, ten inches in diameter. Lightly butter a pie plate nine and a half 
inches in diameter. Arrange the paste nicely over it. Then take up 
from the jar (No. 118) one and a half pounds prepared mince, lay it 
over the lined pie plate ; evenly flatten it, leaving one inch clear around 
the edge of the plate; take the remaining half of the paste, roll it out 



MONDAY, FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY 35 

round, fold it in two and with a knife make three light incisions, each 
half an inch in the centre. Lightly moisten the edge of the plate with 
beaten egg, then cover with the paste, pressing it down with the hands 
all around the edge so as to entirely enclose the preparation, and then 
lightly moisten the surface with beaten egg. 

Place it then in a moderate oven to bake for forty minutes. Remove 
it to the oven door, liberally sprinkle powdered sugar over, return it to 
the oven, close the door for two minutes so as to have the sugar entirely 
melted. Remove from the oven, then lay the pie on a dessert dish and 
serve either hot or cold. 

1 1 8. MINCE MEAT FOR PIE 

Pour into a large saucepan six quarts cold water and place in it nine 
pounds lean, raw rump of beef; put the saucepan on the fire, and when 
it comes to a boil thoroughly skim the scum from the surface and then 
allow it to boil for two hours. Remove the pan from the fire, lay it on a 
table, then with a fork take up the beef, lay it on a dish and let thor- 
oughly cool off. Strain the broth through a sieve into another sauce- 
pan. Have three pounds of fresh beef suet, carefully remove all the 
sinews and then add it to the broth ; place the saucepan on the fire and 
let boil until the suet is thoroughly dissolved, which will take about five 
minutes; add two pounds of well-stoned and finely chopped Malaga 
raisins and let the whole boil for five minutes; then add twenty fine, 
sound, medium-sized, peeled, cored and finely chopped apples and let 
cook again for five minutes. Remove the pan from the fire, transfer the 
contents into a vessel and let thoroughly cool off. 

Chop the beef up very fine, then place it in a vessel, adding three- 
quarters of a pound finely chopped-up candied citron, pouring over it 
half pint good brandy, and let soak for six hours. Boil in a saucepan 
for one minute two quarts good cider, then lay it aside to cool off. Now 
transfer the contents of the two vessels to a large saucepan, adding one 
pound powdered sugar, one pound well-cleaned currants, half pint 
molasses and the cooled-off cider, and with the wooden spoon mix the 
whole well together for three minutes. Season with three ounces salt 
and quarter of an ounce black pepper. Place the saucepan on the fire, 
stir at the bottom with the wooden spoon until it is thoroughly heated, 
but do not allow it to boil. Remove it from the fire, transfer the whole 
into a vessel and let it thoroughly cool off. Then grate in the rind of 
four fine, medium-sized, sound lemons, squeezing in the juice also and 
adding half ounce ground cloves, half ounce ground cinnamon, half 
ounce ground allspice, half ounce grated nutmeg and half pint good 
brandy. Mix the whole well together for five minutes. Then transfer 
it into a large stone jar, tightly cover and lay in a cool place. The above 
preparation will keep in perfect condition for any length of time, even 
as long as six months. 

N. B. Nowadays excellent mincemeat is sold by all responsible 
grocers, and should it prove somewhat difficult to prepare it in your own 
house it can be obtained at said grocers.

Half a boned fowl, one small carrot, one small white turnip, one small 
onion, half green pepper, one leek, two tablespoons raw rice, two quarts 
and a half hot broth (No. 701), four small peeled tomatoes, twelve good- 
sized, sound, fresh okras. Cut the fowl into small square pieces. Cut 
also the carrot, turnip, onion, green pepper and leeks into quarter-inch- 
square pieces and place them in a saucepan with one ounce butter. 
Slowly brown them for ten minutes, add the rice and any chicken bones 
on hand; lightly mix, then moisten with the hot broth. Season with one 
level tablespoon salt, cover the pan and boil for thirty minutes. Cut the 
tomatoes and okras into small pieces and add them to the soup. Boil 
for thirty minutes more. Remove the bones. Pour the soup into a hot 
soup tureen and serve. 

120. KINGFISH SAUTE, COLBERT 

Have three medium-sized kingfish of three-quarters of a pound each, 
nicely cleaned. Wipe them neatly. Turn them in a little cold milk, 
season with one teaspoon salt and half teaspoon white pepper, then roll 
them in flour. 

Heat two tablespoons oil in a frying pan, add the fish and fry for 
five minutes on each side, then place in the hot oven for ten minutes. 
Remove, dress on a hot dish and serve with a Colbert sauce poured over. 

121. COLBERT SAUCE 

Place in a small saucepan two gills demi-glace (No. 122) and one 
teaspoon meat extract (No. 3170); then reduce it on the fire to one-half 
the quantity. Then add, little by little, one-half ounce good butter, 
briskly stirring while adding it. Squeeze in the juice of a sound lemon, 
adding a teaspoon finely minced parsley. Stir well and serve. 

122. DEMI- GLACE (HALF- GLAZE) 

Have quite a large saucepan with ten quarts cold water on the hot 
range. Procure two fresh, white, calf's feet; cut them into small pieces 
and place in a small roasting pan with half pound raw ham, cut in pieces, 
one pound veal bones, two sliced carrots, two sliced onions, two sliced 
leeks, three branches parsley roots, one branch sliced celery; add ten 
cloves, four bay leaves, twenty allspices, two tablespoons whole black 
peppers, a teaspoon thyme and one and one-half tablespoons salt. 
Spread a little fat about four tablespoons over the vegetables. Place 



MONDAY, FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY 3 j 

the pan in a hot oven and let get a nice golden colour. Remove from 
the oven, take up the feet and vegetables from the pan and plunge them 
into the pan with the ten quarts water; add one pint canned or the equiv- 
alent of fresh tomatoes. Let slowly boil for thirty minutes. Set the 
pan near the corner of the range, place the cover on and let slightly 
simmer. When any little parings of beef, veal, chicken, ham and 
vegetables are at hand, always place them into this important demi- 
glace. When opening cans of mushrooms add the mushroom liquor 
to this stock, also. Always keep the pan on the hot range until reduced 
to one-half the quantity. 

Heat in a large saucepan three ounces butter or good melted lard, 
adding six tablespoons flour. Stir well with a wooden spoon and let 
thoroughly brown on the fire for twenty minutes, occasionally stirring. 
Pour the above preparation into this pan, mix well, shift the pan on one 
side of the range, keeping it at a gentle simmering point for twelve hours. 
Then add half pint sherry; mix a little, strain the demi-glace through a 
Chinese strainer into a stone jar; let cool off, then cover the jar. Keep 
in a cool place and use as required. In winter it will keep in good con- 
dition for three or four weeks, but in hot weather it would be advisable 
to re-boil it once every week. 

This demi-glace is of vast importance, and it is necessary to always 
have some on hand. Therefore, when the supply is nearly exhausted, 
repeat the same operation. 

N. B. Whatever quantity of demi-glace is required for each occa- 
sion, when taken up from the jar always dilute it with a little hot broth, 
so as to have it somewhat liquid before using. 

123. POTATOES, CHASSEPOT 

Peel three large, sound, raw potatoes. Cut them into cartridge 
shape one and a half inches long. Mince very finely an onion, one leek 
and one ounce of lean salt pork. 

Place them in a small saucepan with half ounce butter and brown to 
a good golden colour. Add the potatoes and one bay leaf. Season with 
half teaspoon salt and two saltspoons white pepper. Mix well with the 
wooden spoon, add one gill hot water. .Cover the pan and boil for 
twenty minutes. Dress on a hot dish, sprinkle a little chopped parsley 
over and serve. 

124. SQUABS EN CASSEROLE 

Singe, cut the heads and feet off, draw and wipe neatly six fine, fat 
squabs. Arrange a thin slice of lard on the breast of each bird, tie them 
well around and lay them in a roasting pan. Sprinkle a teaspoon salt 
and half teaspoon white pepper over them. Pour at the bottom of the 
pan three tablespoons cold water and place in a hot oven to roast for 
twenty minutes, basting with their own gravy occasionally and turning 
them over once in a while. Remove, untie the strings, dress on a hot 
dish. Skim the fat off the gravy, add three chopped shallots, two table- 
spoons demi-glace (No. 122), two tablespoons hot water. Boil the 



38 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

gravy in the pan on a brisk fire for five minutes. Pour the gravy over 
the birds. Arrange at each end of the dish one cluster of cooked green 
peas and on the other sides a cluster of glazed onions prepared as per 
No. 125 and serve. 

125. GLAZED ONIONS 

Carefully peel twenty-four very small, white, sound onions, all of 
about the same size if possible. Place them in a lightly buttered sauce- 
pan, all at the bottom of the pan. Pour in one gill cold w r ater, half tea- 
spoon salt, two saltspoons white pepper, half teaspoon powdered sugar 
and half ounce butter. Cover the onions with a sheet of buttered paper. 
Place the pan on a brisk fire and boil for five minutes; then place the 
pan in the hot oven until the water is completely evaporated. Add two 
tablespoons of half glaze (demi-glace, No. 122). Heat for three min- 
utes and serve. 

126. ROAST RIBS OF BEEF 

Procure from a reliable butcher a three-rib piece of fine, tender, 
mature rib of beef near the short-loin part. Saw off the spine, also 
the bones of the three ribs, to one inch from the meat. Season with a 
tablespoon salt, equally divided all over, tie it together and place it 
lengthwise in a roasting pan. Pour one and a half tablespoons cold 
water into the pan to prevent burning; place a few small bits of butter 
well distributed on top of the beef. Set it in a rather moderate oven 
and let roast for one hour and ten minutes, taking care to baste fre- 
quently with its own gravy and to turn it once in a while. Remove it 
from the oven, untie, dress on a very hot dish, skim the fat from the 
gravy, pour two tablespoons broth into the gravy, heat up a little, strain 
the gravy into a saucebowl and send to the table. (Keep all parings

brandy; season with a saltspoon cayenne pepper and slowly boil the soup 
for twenty minutes. Skim the fat from the surface, add three table- 
spoons arrowroot diluted in two tablespoons sherry; lightly mix, boil 
for one minute longer, pour into a hot soup tureen and serve. 

N. B. Excellent green turtle, already prepared, can now be obtained 
at almost any reliable fish dealer's ; still I deem it proper to give the sub- 
joined explanations of how to prepare it. 

How TO PREPARE A GREEN TURTLE 

Procure a small live green turtle of about twenty-five pounds. Hang 
it up with the head downward, then with a sharp knife cut off 
the head and let bleed for twelve hours. Separate the upper from the 
lower shell with the knife, being careful to avoid cutting the gall bladder. 
Remove the intestines, cut the flesh away from the shells, as well as 
bones, etc. Cut each shell into four equal pieces, plunge in boiling water 
and blanch for three minutes. Lift them up, drain well, then with a 
small knife detach all the horny skin around the shells. 

Place in a large saucepan five pounds bones or parings of veal, also 
about two pounds lean parings of beef, as well as a few beef bones. 
Pour in seven gallons cold water. Season with six tablespoons salt and 
one tablespoon white pepper and let come to a boil. Carefully remove 
the scum from the surface. Add six small peeled carrots, six medium, 
white onions, four leeks, two branches celery, one bunch parsley. Tie 
in a cloth four sprigs bay leaf, a teaspoon thyme, half teaspoon sage, two 
tablespoons whole black peppers, a tablespoon allspice, six cloves, two 
blades mace and add to the broth ; then slowly boil for six hours. Strain 
the broth through a sieve into another large saucepan on the range; add 
one gallon cold water and all the shells and fins and briskly boil for 
twenty-five minutes. Remove the fins and keep them on a dish and 



i8o THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

slowly cook the shells, etc., for forty-five minutes. Remove the shells 
and place them with the fins. 

Strain the broth through a cheesecloth into another saucepan and 
keep on the range. Remove all the meat from the shells and fins and 
cut the green part of the meat into half -inch-square pieces and keep on a 
plate. Reduce the broth to one gallon and a half, then add the meat 
pieces and boil for five minutes. Transfer it into a stone jar, let thor- 
oughly cool off and place the jar in the ice box till the next day. 

Lightly melt in a frying pan four ounces leaf lard and carefully spread 
it over the surface of the broth to prevent souring, and always keep in a 
cool place. 

The lean part of the turtle can be cut into thin slices quarter of 
an inch thick; then breaded and fried in butter for six minutes and 
served as steaks with tomato sauce, or finely minced and prepared 
Creole style. 

640. FILET OF BEEF LARDED, MADEIRA SAUCE 

Prepare a larded filet of beef exactly the same as per No. 144. Dress

spoon cayenne pepper; mix well, then gently boil for five minutes more. 
Pour into a hot saucebowl and serve. 

642. SWEETBREADS, ALICE 

Soak six heart sweetbreads in cold water for two hours. Lift them 
up and plunge into two quarts boiling water with a teaspoon salt to 
blanch for five minutes. Lift up, drain well on a cloth, then neatly trim 
all around. Cut twenty-four very thin strips larding pork, and with a 
very small larding needle carefully lard the top of each sweetbread with 
four strips of the lard. Lay the breads in a sautoire, one beside another. 
Season with a teaspoon salt, two saltspoons cayenne pepper and a salt- 
spoon of grated nutmeg, adding three-quarters of a pint cold cream and 
one pint very fresh milk. Cover the pan and boil on the range for ten 
minutes, then add twelve good-sized peeled and well-cleaned fresh 
mushroom heads and boil for fifteen minutes longer. Knead well 
half ounce butter with a teaspoon flour in a bowl and carefully add, 
little by little, to the breads ; mix well with a wooden spoon while cooking 
for one minute, without breaking the breads. Remove the pan to the 
table. Have six small individual mushroom glass bells. Cut six round 
pieces bread to the diameter of the bottom of the bells; lightly toast 
them. Place each toast in a shirred-egg dish, then place a sweet- 
bread on top of each toast, nicely arrange two heads of mushrooms on 
top of each sweetbread, then cover them with the glass bells. Divide 



MONDAY, SECOND WEEK OF FEBRUARY 181 

the sauce of the breads evenly in the six dishes around the bells. Place 
on the range, and as soon as they come to a boil place in a moderate

3281. To CLEAN AND PREPARE SULTANA CURRANTS AND RAISINS 

FOR PASTRY 

Procure ten pounds currants or Sultana raisins, lay on table and, 
should they be damp, dredge a little flour over to prevent adhering to 
the hands. Briskly rub, place on a fine wire sieve and shake well for 
three minutes, so as to have them completely free from flour and stalks. 
Lay sieve with fruits in a large dishpan, fill up to level of sieve with hot 
water, stir well with skimmer for five minutes, lift up sieve and let drain 
for four minutes. 

Cover an iron pan with a sheet of brown paper, drop contents over, 
well spread out, then set in a rather slow oven for ten minutes. Remove, 



, 

ioi2 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

lay in warmest place on kitchen shelf and let dry for fully two days. 
Lay on a table and carefully remove stones, sand, stalks, or any other 
element except the perfect fruit, place in a tin box, tightly cover, keep in a 
cool place and use as required. 

[The above important articles are so frequently required for pastry 
purposes, etc., that I consider it advisable to prepare a larger amount 
than required for one occasion, as they will remain in good condition for 
six months when properly kept.] 

3282. SPONGE FOR FRENCH BREAD (LEVAIN) 

Sift on table two pounds best quality thoroughly ripe flour, place 
half in a bowl sufficiently large to hold six or seven quarts and carefully 
make a fountain in centre of it. Place a half-ounce cake very fresh, 
firm, cold compressed yeast in bowl, pour over a half pint lukewarm 
water and thoroughly dissolve with hand for two and a half minutes. 
Pour into fountain, mix a little, gradually incorporate flour for five 
minutes and sharply knead all well together for six minutes. Cover 
bowl with a dry cloth, then lay vessel in a warm place of 80 degrees 
temperature to rise during the night (or at least two and a half to three 
hours) without touching it. The sponge will then have risen to double 
size, fallen, risen again, and be in proper condition for dough. 

N. B. In using flour for making any kind of bread always remember 
never to employ flour when cold or warm that is to say, it should be in 
a place of 60 degrees temperature at least twelve hours before using it. 

3283. DOUGH FOR FRENCH BREAD 

Place in a bowl a half pint lukewarm water or the same quantity 
lukewarm milk, a half ounce salt, and dissolve for a minute. Uncover 
bowl, pour water on sponge, thoroughly knead the whole well together 
for six minutes, add little by little the remaining pound of flour, briskly 
and constantly kneading meanwhile. The kneading operation after 
the flour has been added should continue for twenty-five to thirty minutes. 
Lift up dough with the hands and knock it as hard as you can against 
bottom of vessel ten different times, immediately cover vessel with dry 
cloth, put in warm place of same temperature as before (80 degrees) 
and allow to rise for two and a half hours again. 

3284. To SHAPE THE FRENCH LOAF ( JOCKO) 

Remove cloth from vessel, transfer dough to a lightly floured table 
and cut in two even pieces. With the hands roll and press out each piece 
in ball shape for four .minutes, shift them to corner of table, cover 
with a dry cloth and let rest for ten minutes, being careful to avoid 
draughts. Then neatly roll out one piece with hands evenly to four 
inches and let rest for two minutes, then roll it out round to seventeen 
inches long. 

Have a board eighteen inches square. Arrange over it a piece of dry 
duck cloth the length of board, and eight inches wide, and flute cloth on 
both sides two and a half inches high and three inches wide. Carefully lay 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECIPES 1013 

the loaf -shape dough in section or "bed," cover it with a dry cloth or a 
lightly buttered piece of paper, and place in a temperature of 80 degrees 
to rise for one hour. It should rise to double its size by that time. 

3285. To SHAPE THE RING (COURONNE) 

Carefully roll out the other piece of dough evenly with hands to eight 
inches, let rest for two minutes, then roll it out round to twenty-two inches 
long and sprinkle a little cornmeal flour over surface to prevent sticking 
to pan. With an ordinary rolling-pin, twenty-four inches long by 
half an inch in diameter, briskly press down dough in centre from end 
to end to depth of half the dough, leaving one-half intact, then carefully 
turn pin three or four times. Take up pin and firmly join both ends, 
giving it a pretty ring shape. Have a lightly buttered tin pan, carefully 
place ring in pan, split side down, cover with a dry cloth or piece of 
buttered paper, and also lay in a place of 80 degrees temperature to rise 
for one hour. 

3286. To BAKE THE FRENCH LOAF ( JOCKO) 

Shortly before time for baking bread be very careful to see oven is at 
proper degree of heat. A very simple way to determine whether the 
heat is right or not is to place a piece of white paper in oven, close door, 
and after a lapse of five minutes open door and remove paper. If it 
is a dark-brown colour the temperature is right, if it burns it is too hot 
and should be cooled a little, and if it is only a light brown colour 
it should be made hotter. 

Remove covering from French loaf. Have a low-edged baking pan 
large enough to easily hold loaf placed alongside the board, then carefully 
turn over loaf into pan by means of the cloth without touching the 
dough with the hands. If loaf is not in exactly straight position in pan 
use a piece of pasteboard to straighten it, then with a small, keen knife 
make four or five rapid diagonal half-inch-deep incisions at equal dis- 
tances on top. 

3287. To BAKE THE RING (COURONNE) 

Have a pie plate or round roasting pan large enough to easily hold 
ring, remove cloth from ring, gently and carefully turn it upside down 
(split side up) in the pan and immediately place both in oven to bake 
for about an hour, or until a nice golden colour. Avoid opening 
oven door until twenty minutes after bread has been set in oven. After 
baking for thirty minutes turn bread over; if bottom is white, that is, 
if it has not attained a good colour, turn upside down and leave in that 
position for balance of time, then remove and serve. 

3288. FRENCH ROLLS AND FLUTTES (CALLED "PISTOLETS") 

Prepare same amount of sponge and dough exactly the same as for 
French loaf and ring (Nos. 3282 and 3283). When the "ready" dough 
is transferred and rolled out on floured table cut it in twenty-four equal 
parts instead of two. Roll out with hands into ball shape, cover with 
a dry cloth and let rest for four minutes, being careful to avoid draughts. 



ioi4 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

3289. To SHAPE FRENCH "ROLLS 

Have same board as used for French loaf standing by. Place on it 
a duck cloth considerably longer than board, and flute in sections two 
inches apart and two inches high. Dredge a very little cornmeal flour 
over twelve of the balls only, lay rolling-pin crosswise over one of the 
balls right in centre, and with both hands press down to about three- 
quarters the height of roll. Carefully roll pin around two or three times, 
being careful to leave a quarter of bottom intact. Lay roll very carefully 
in a section of the cloth, split side down, and proceed with eleven more in 
the same manner, taking care to keep them about one inch apart from one 
another in the sections. 

3290. To SHAPE FLUTTES (PISTOLETS) 

Take one of the remaining twelve balls, with the hands roll and press 
it out to four and a half inches long and round pointed at both ends, and 
arrange it in a section of the fluted cloth. Finish the other remaining 
eleven in same way, place in sections, also keeping them an inch apart 
from one another. Cover with a dry cloth or buttered paper and place 
them in a temperature of 80 degrees to rise for forty-five minutes. 

3291. To BAKE ROLLS AND FLUTTES 

After allowing rolls and fluttes to rise for forty-five minutes, in which 
time they ought to have doubled in size if temperature was right, remove 
cloth. Have a baking pan alongside board, take up rolls from their 
bed with a piece of pasteboard and turn into baking pan, split side up, 
keeping them an inch apart from one another. Sprinkle a very little 
cornmeal flour over fluttes, carefully transfer with a piece of pasteboard 
from fluted cloth into baking dish with rolls, keeping them also one inch 
from one another, then with a small sharp knife make three light diagonal 
incisions on top of twelve fluttes only, set in oven to bake for half an hour, 
or until they attain a nice golden colour, remove and serve. 

N. B. If desired, French loaf and ring, rolls and fluttes can all be 
prepared at same time that is, one loaf, one ring, twelve each rolls and 
fluttes with identical process by simply doubling quantity of each in- 
gredient, using a vessel of double capacity (to easily hold twelve quarts) 
for sponge, dough, etc., and ready dough cut and rolled out accordingly. 

3292. FERMENT (AN EXCELLENT HOME-MADE YEAST) 
For two quarts of ferment: Procure six small, raw, old potatoes 
the size of ordinary eggs the uglier, more common-looking and thicker- 
skinned the better, but they must be sound. Thoroughly wash till 
completely free from sand, place in small enamelled pan, pour a quart 
cold water over, let gently cook until soft, which will take considerable 
time (or nearly fifty minutes), and drop potatoes and water in which 
they were boiled into a deep, narrow vessel. The water will have 
reduced by this time to one pint ; if reduced more than a pint add shorten- 
ing to make a pint. Add six ounces sifted flour, carefully and thoroughly 
mash potatoes, flour and water with a potato masher until a firm pulp, or 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECIPES 1015 

for about fifteen minutes. Add a quart cold water (in hot weather; 
lukewarm in cold weather), then carefully dissolve ingredients with the 
hand until completely free from lumps and see that the ferment is just 
to a lukewarm point before adding yeast. Take up a half cup of the 
ferment and add to it a half -ounce cake firm, fresh compressed yeast, 
thoroughly dissolve with the hand, add to ferment and thoroughly whisk 
with pastry whisk until frothy. Remove whisk, cover vessel, place a 
heavy dry cloth around and set in warm place to rise during night. 
First thing in the morning remove cloth and cover from vessel, then whisk 
ferment for five minutes and strain through strainer into a stone jar, 
pressing everything through except skins of potatoes. Tightly cover, 
place in ice box and use as directed when required, taking care to always 
briskly shake the jar just before using ferment. 

N. B. The above ferment is of wide importance for the purpose of 
strengthening the preparation of the sponge, lightening and giving a 
delicious, sweet, succulent taste to bread. 

3293. MILK DOUGH FOR Two RINGS 

(l2 MILK FLUTTES AND 12 DOUGHNUTS) 

Break two fresh eggs in a bowl, gradually add a pint boiled milk 
(made lukewarm before using it), gently beat up with a fork for two 
minutes, then add two ounces fine sugar, two teaspoons salt, one and a 
half teaspoons vanilla essence (No. 3236), and mix the whole well to- 
gether for two minutes. Add a pint ferment, made lukewarm in a 
bain-marie (double pan) in cold weather and used cold in hot weather. 
A saltspoon powdered cinnamon can be added if desired, which will give 
a fine additional flavour. 

Place in a dishpan three pounds thoroughly ripe, best quality sifted 
flour, make a wide fountain in centre of flour, then pour brewing into 
fountain. Briskly mix with the hand and gradually incorporate flour 
for six minutes, then sharply knead for twenty-five to thirty minutes. 
Lift up with hands and vigorously knock it against bottom of pan about 
ten times, carefully cover pan with a dry cloth and place in a warm place 
to rise during the night. Lightly flour table, remove dough from 
vessel, place on floured table and briskly work for ten minutes, sprinkling 
a little flour over once in a while. Divide dough into four equal parts, 
carefully roll out to ball shape, cover and let rest for ten minutes, avoiding 
draughts. 

3294. To SHAPE MILK RINGS (" COURONNES ") 

Take up a ball and with the thumb make a hole in centre of dough. 
Rapidly turn hand around ball until open space is enlarged to four 
inches, the ring of equal size all around, and lay it on a lightly buttered 
baking pan. Prepare another in exactly same manner, cover all with a 
dry cloth and place for an hour in a temperature of 80 degrees to rise. 

3295. To BAKE MILK RINGS ("COURONNES") 

Beat up an egg in a bowl with three tablespoons milk, then with a 
small hair pastry brush lightly glaze surface of the two rings and with a 



ioi6 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

pair of scissors or a small sharp knife make a few double incisions on 
surface of each ring all around. Set in oven to bake for an hour, being 
careful not to open oven door for twenty minutes. Carefully watch and 
see that it is equally baked all around, remove and serve. 

3296. To SHAPE THE MILK FLUTTES 

Roll and gently press out another ball, with a cutter divide in twelve 
equal pieces, and with the hands roll each piece into nice round shape, 
cover, let rest for ten minutes, then roll out each piece to five inches 
long and pointed at both ends. Place in a lightly buttered baking pan, 
and with pastry brush lightly glaze surface of each with beaten-up egg, 
etc. Carefully make three small diagonal incisions with scissors or a 
small sharp knife, cover with a dry cloth and place for an hour in a 
temperature of 80 degrees to rise. 

3297. To BAKE THE FLUTTES 

After lapse of an hour remove cloth and immediately set in oven to 
bake for thirty minutes, or until they have attained a nice golden colour 
all around, remove and serve. 

3298. DOUGHNUTS 

With a rolling-pin roll and spread out the last ball of dough to one- 
eighth-inch thickness. With a doughnut cutter cut out twelve pieces, 
place on tin, cover with a dry cloth and allow to rise in a warm place for 
thirty minutes. Arrange in a frying basket, fry in boiling fat until a 
nice golden colour on both sides, turning over once in a while, remove, 
thoroughly drain, dredge a little powdered sugar over and serve. 

3299. REMARKS ABOUT "UNIVERSAL" BREAD MAKING MACHINE FOR 

PRIVATE FAMILIES 

I recently came across a peculiar looking small bread maker, called 
the "Universal Bread Maker." After carefully examining, I purchased 
one for the purpose of trying it in my own house to find out about 
its merits. After having tried and carefully observed the result of its 
workings, I was satisfied of the efficiency and merit claimed for it by its 
owners. The No. 4 Universal Machine has a capacity of from two to 
six loaves or rings of bread. The No. 8 Universal has a capacity of 
from four to ten loaves or rings. The machine is of such simplicity 
that a child can work it. On the first trial I followed their recipe through- 
out, and the bread turned out all right but a little heavy. With the second 
recipe (No. 3301) the bread turned out simply delicious in every respect. 
Another important point 'in its favour is that in working the sponge 
and part of the dough it does away with use of the hands. 

3300. FRENCH BREAD BY THE " UNIVERSAL " BREAD MAKER, No. i 

(This sponge is for four loaves of plain French bread.) 
Sift on a table three pounds thoroughly ripe, best quality flour. 
Measure out a quart warm water, pour it in the bread maker, reserving 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECIPES 1017 

b the measure about half a cup. Crumble a half -ounce cake fresh, 
firm compressed yeast into a cup, half fill the cup with lukewarm water 
and thoroughly dissolve yeast. Pour the dissolved yeast into bread 
maker with water, adding two heaping teaspoons salt and three pounds 
flour all at once. (Liquids should always be poured in first.) Briskly 
turn crank for three minutes, or until dough forms about kneading 
rod in a smooth, compact ball. Put on cover of machine, place over a 
dry cloth and set in temperature of 80 degrees to rise during night. 
After rising turn crank until dough forms a ball about kneader again, 
then loosen crosspiece and lift kneader and dough on it out of pad 
together. Push dough off kneading rod, cut into four equal parts, 
shape and place in baking tins and set to bake for about an hour. 

On first trial I followed the above recipe throughout and the bread 
turned out all right, but a little heavy. 

3301. FRENCH BREAD BY THE "UNIVERSAL" BREAD MAKER, No. 2 

(Sponge for four loaves of plain French bread.) 
Proceed to prepare sponge in exactly same manner as No. 3300. 
Remove dough in the morning after rising during night, place on a 
floured table or in a lightly floured, quite large dishpan and sharply 
work for twelve or fifteen minutes, then lift up with hands and vigorously 
knock against bottom of pan or table eight or ten different times. Cut 
dough into four equal parts, roll out to ball shape, cover with a dry 
cloth, let rest for ten minutes, then roll out to loaf, ring or any shape 
desired. Carefully arrange loaves on fluted cloth on the board (No. 
3284) and rings (No. 3285). 

Cover with a dry cloth or buttered paper, place in temperature of 
80 degrees for an hour and remove cloth. Have baking pan placed 
alongside board, carefully turn loaves into it and make four or five very 
rapid half -inch-deep incisions at equal distances on top. If there be any 
rings prepare in same manner (No. 3285), then place both in oven to 
bake for an hour or until a nice golden colour, not opening oven door 
for twenty minutes and carefully watching that bread is well baked all 
around, remove and serve. 

With this second recipe the bread turned out simply delicious in 
every respect. 

3302. RYE BREAD 

Prepare sponge same as No. 3300, but using two-thirds wheat 'and 
one-third rye flour, adding a teaspoon kummel seeds. After dough 
has risen during night remove either to floured table or dishpan, and 
briskly work it for twelve or fifteen minutes. Should it be slightly 
soft sprinkle over a little flour until of such firm consistency that it 
will not stick to pan. Divide dough into four equal parts, roll in round 
shapes, cover and let rest for ten minutes. Then roll out to loaf or 
ring shape, cover with a dry cloth, set to rise for one hour in temperature 
of 80 degrees, transfer to baking tin and sprinkle a very little cornmeal 
flour, over top of each. Make a few rapid incisions on top at equal dis- 



ioi8 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

tance from one another, then with a hair pastry brush lightly wet surface 
of each with water, set in oven to bake for an hour or until well baked 
all around, being careful not to open the oven door before the lapse of 
twenty minutes. Remove from oven, lightly glaze surface again with 
water and reset in oven to dry for five minutes, take out and serve. 

3303. CORNMEAL PAN BREAD 

Mix and sift two pounds cornmeal flour and a quarter pound wheat 
flour in a dishpan, gradually pour one and one-eighth quarts boiling 
water over and briskly stir with spatula to a tepid point. Briskly beat 
two fresh eggs in a china vessel with fork for two minutes, add one and 
a half teaspoons good honey, two teaspoons salt, a tablespoon melted 
butter (or good melted lard instead), teaspoon lemon essence and three 
gills lukewarm ferment (No. 3292), then briskly mix all well together 
for three minutes. Gradually add mixture to flour, sharply stirring 
while adding, and continue to sharply mix with spatula for thirty 
minutes. Have a high-edged baking pan greased all around with a 
tablespoon melted lard, transfer batter to pan, cover with a piece of 
paper and place in a temperature of 80 degrees for two hours to rise. 

Remove paper, then set pan in oven to bake until a nice light brown 
colour on top, which will take about one hour, turning pan two or three 
times meanwhile. Remove, cut bread into pieces of any desired shape 
and serve with butter on a hot dish in folded napkin. 

Left-over bread can be heated up in oven and served again, as it 
will keep in good condition for two or three days. 

3304. MILK CORNMEAL BREAD, MONTGOMERY 

Place two pounds sifted cornmeal and a quarter pound sifted wheat 
flour in a dishpan, sprinkle over one and one-eighth quarts boiling 
milk and briskly stir with the spatula until tepid. Beat in a bowl for 
two minutes three fresh eggs with a fork, add two teaspoons salt, three 
teaspoons fine sugar, a teaspoon orange-flower water, tablespoon good 
melted butter and three gills lukewarm ferment (No. 3292). Whisk 
the whole well together for three minutes, add to flour and sharply mix 
with spatula for thirty minutes. By that time it will be of a smooth, 
consistent dough. Thoroughly grease a high-edged roasting pan with 
a tablespoon good melted lard, transfer dough into pan, cover with a 
piece of paper and lay in a temperature of 80 degrees for two hours 
to rise, remove covering and set to bake for about an hour, or until a 
nice golden colour. Avoid opening oven door for twenty minutes, 
after that turn pan around two or three times, remove, cut into any 
desired shape and serve on hot dish with a folded napkin. 

3305. MUFFINS, MRS. HALDEMAN 

Have in a vessel a pound sifted yellow cornmeal flour and four ounces 
sifted wheat flour, pour over a pint and a light gill boiling milk and 
briskly stir with wooden spatula until tepid. Beat up two fresh eggs 
in a bowl for two minutes, add one and a half gills lukewarm ferment 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECIPES 1019 

(No. 3292), a teaspoon each salt and fine sugar, tablespoon good honey, 
light tablespoon melted fresh butter, and ten shelled, thoroughly scalded, 
peeled and finely pounded almonds, whisk well for three minutes, add 
to flour, and sharply mix the whole well together for twenty-five minutes 
with spatula. Have a pastry pan well greased with melted lard, butter 
well interiors of twelve muffin-ring moulds and lay moulds in pan. 
With a spoon fill them up to three-quarters of their height, cover with a 
paper and place them in temperature of 80 degrees for one and a half 
hours to rise. Remove paper and set in oven to bake for about thirty- 
five to forty minutes, or until a nice golden colour, remove, unmould, 
dress on hot dish enveloped in a napkin and serve with butter. Grease 
well a small square pan, place in it the remaining dough, well spread, 
cover and set to rise in temperature of 80 degrees for one and a half 
to two hours. Uncover and set to bake until of a nice light brown, or 
about one hour, turning pan around two or three times after twenty 
minutes of baking. Remove and serve for next occasion, cut up in any 
shaped slice desired. 

3306. To ROAST COFFEE IN A SIMPLE WAY 

Have two-thirds of a pound best raw Java coffee mixed with one- 
third pound best quality Mocha. Butter a baking dish well with good 
butter all around interior, place coffee in plate and set in a moderate 
oven to roast until a good golden brown colour. (It will take about 
twenty-two minutes.) Be very careful frequently to mix in every 
direction with a wooden spoon meanwhile, place in an earthen jar and 
tightly cover, keep in a moderate temperature and use as required. 

3307. To ROAST COFFEE IN COFFEE ROASTER 

Procure a small family coffee roaster, open small section that acts 
as a cover and drop coffee (two-thirds of a pound raw Java and one-third 
of a pound raw Mocha) into the roaster. If convenient have a good 
charcoal fire in range, remove one of the lids then set roaster over fire. 
See that the cover is firmly closed, and turn the small handle rather 
slowly but constantly for fifteen minutes. Remove roaster from its 
stand, thoroughly shake coffee in roaster in all directions for two seconds, 
reset on its stand and continue to roast, constantly turning until a good 
light brown colour, which should take from twenty-five to twenty -eight 
minutes. Remove cover to see when proper colour is attained, and 
when doing so do npt let roaster stand over fire but shift to corner of 
range. Place in an earthen jar, tightly cover, keep in a moderate tem- 
perature and use as required. 

By roasting your own coffee as above described, you may be sure 
to always have it fresh and retaining its full aroma. 

3308. To MAKE AFTER-DINNER COFFEE 

Take six light tablespoons roasted coffee beans from jar and grind 
in mill, neither too fine nor too coarse. Have a thoroughly clean, small 
French coffee pot and thoroughly scald with boiling water just a minute 



1020 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

before time of making the coffee, arrange a piece of dry, clean, old linen 
cloth around the section of pot and filter to insure perfect clarifica- 
tion. Place the ground coffee on filter and pour over a pint and a half 
thoroughly (fresh) boiling water little by little. When water is poured 
over place cover on, being very careful that on no account does it boil. 
Keep on corner of range or, better still, in a pan of boiling water up 
to height of three inches on coffee pot until coffee is filtered, then serve 
in six after-dinner cups. Coffee should never be made more than three 
or four minutes before time to serve. 

3309. ANOTHER MODE OF MAKING EXCELLENT AFTER-DINNER 

COFFEE 

Have a rather small ordinary earthen (clay) pot or enamelled pan. 
Grind in coffee mill six light tablespoons roasted coffee and place in 
pan, measure out one and a half pints cold fresh water, carefully sprinkle 
a gill (only) of it all over coffee, immediately put cover on, let infuse in a 
cool place for twenty minutes, then pour in balance of cold water (five 
gills). Mix well with a clean wooden stick, cover, then set pan on the 
side of the fire and let very slowly come just to a boiling point. On no 
account allow it to boil, being careful to mix with wooden stick two or 
three times only while heating up and to immediately replace cover each 
time. Remove from range, let settle for two minutes, arrange a piece 
of clean, dry old linen or muslin cloth over a hot serving coffee pot, pour 
coffee over, and when all strained immediately serve in six after-dinner 
cups. 

3310. COFFEE WITH MILK, Swiss STYLE 

Grind six light tablespoons roasted coffee beans from the jar 
(No 3306) and place in an earthen pot. Sprinkle all over a good gill 
cold water, immediately cover pot and set on one side to infuse for 
twenty minutes. Pour over three and a half pints fresh, cold milk, 
mix well with wooden stick, cover pan, set pot on the side of the fire 
and let very slowly come to just a boiling point, mixing with wooden 
stick quite frequently meanwhile. Shift pot to corner of range and let 
settle for three minutes, strain through a clean, dry old linen cloth into 
a hot pitcher and serve in six "cafe* au lait" cups. 

3311. HOME-MADE CHOCOLATE 

(To roast cacao for the chocolate?) 

Procure a half pound each Caracas and Puerto Cabello raw cacao 
in shell, being careful to select nuts intact, that is to say, not bruised 
or broken. Should there be any broken ones among them lay aside 
for further action. Place cacao in a small coffee roaster, close cover, 
place over a clear fire on range (the entire barrel of roaster over fire), 
and gently turn at the rate of twenty turns per minute, continuing for 
twelve minutes without ceasing. Rapidly take roaster from its stand, 
briskly shake barrel, immediately replace it on stand and rapidly resume 
gentle turning at same rate for eight minutes longer. Remove it again, 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECIPES 1021 

and should there be any bruised or broken cacao left add to the other, 
tightly slide cover on, briskly shake, replace on fire and roast again same 
as before, but for six minutes only. Remove cacao from roaster to a 
tin, cover with a dry cloth and let cool for ten minutes. Carefully shell 
cacao, place latter in a tin and shells ki a bowl, keeping them for future 
use. Briskly shuffle cacao in tin pan and blow off all remnants of shells. 
N. B. If no coffee roaster is on hand to roast cacao then use an un- 
tinned kitchen basin and roast in oven to a good golden brown. 

3312. To PREPARE THE CHOCOLATE 

Pour some boiling water in a stone mortar to heat it well, remove, 
wipe dry, then place cacao in mortar and with stone-pounder, also 
warmed up, crush to a fine powder. Cut one-third of a bean best 
vanilla into exceedingly small pieces and add to cacao, sharply pound 
again for thirty minutes or till completely free from grit, detaching pulp 
with a spoon from around mortar once in a while. Gradually add a 
pound sifted fine sugar to the cacao, and vigorously pound again until 
a fine paste totally free from any clots. Take up pulp from mortar, 
roll it into a ball and sharply flatten between the hands. Repeat this 
three times. To have chocolate right the temperature where it is 
worked should be not less than 70 degrees. 

Have two eight-sectioned chocolate moulds, each section to hold an 
ounce. Divide chocolate in two equal parts, then divide one part in 
half. Roll out these halves with the hands to length of mould and 
neatly and carefully spread it out equally to fully cover all sections of 
mould. Lift up mould by taking hold in centre of the narrov/ sides 
with thumb and finger and gently knock on table till chocolate is equally 
and smoothly spread in all the sections. Proceed with other half in 
same manner, then place both moulds on top of ice for thirty minutes, 
or until perfectly hard. Remove from ice, unmould, wrap in chocolate 
tinfoil, place in tin box, tightly cover, place in a dry, cool place and use 
when desired. 

3313. HOME-MADE CHOCOLATE WAFERS (PASTILLES) 

Have three ordinary low-edged tins (used for this purpose only). 
With the hands roll out remaining pound of chocolate to a long, thin, 
round, flute-like shape, then divide into small pieces the size of good- 
sized hazel nuts, roll with the fingers into balls and lay on tins a half 
inch apart. Take hold of a corner of each tin with the hand and 
slightly knock on table, so as to have the pastilles in a nice, round, smooth 
shape of about a half inch in diameter. As soon as a tin is full place it 
directly on the ice, and when another is ready place it alongside the 
first. When the third is finished the one first put on ice should be quite 
hard enough; remove and place the last one in its place and let stand 
until hard. Remove from ice, spread a large sheet of white paper on 
table, turn tins upside down and sharply shake off pastilles from pans. 
Dress on a dessert dish over a fancy paper and serve, or place in a tin 
box, tightly cover, place in a cool spot and use as required. 



1022 THE INTERNATIONAL COOK BOOK 

N. B. Cacao shells should never be thrown away. Prepared as 
you would prepare tea, they make an excellent stomach-fortifying 
tonic. Place a tablespoon shells in a teapot, pour boiling water over, 
allow to infuse for ten minutes, strain and serve. Place shells in a 
covered tin, keep in a cool place and use as desired. 

3314. PLAIN CHOCOLATE 

Have an earthen pot on range with a half pint cold water. Take 
six (if desired strong, four if desired not quite so strong) tablets of the 
prepared chocolate (No. 3312), break into powder and add to water, 
then stir with wooden spoon until thoroughly dissolved. Pour a quart 
boiling water over, briskly mix with wooden spoon and allow to gently 
simmer for ten minutes, frequently mixing meanwhile. Pour into a hot 
pitcher and send to table with six chocolate cups and fine sugar separately. 

3315. CHOCOLATE WITH MILK 

Have in an earthen pot on the range a pint of cold water, crumble 
four ounces prepared chocolate (No. 3312), add to pot and briskly mix 
with a very clean wooden spoon till completely dissolved. Gradually 
add a quart fresh milk, mix well, let gently come to a boiling point, 
frequently mixing with wooden spoon meanwhile, pour into a hot pitcher 
and serve in six chocolate cups with fine sugar separately. 

3316. CLARET PUNCH 

Place in a two-gallon punch bowl with sufficient ice six tablespoons 
pulverised sugar, juice of six oranges and nine lemons, a half pint red 
curacoa, pint brandy, six bottles plain soda and six quarts claret. 
Ornament with sliced oranges and pineapples, mix thoroughly with 
ladle and serve in fancy glasses. 

3317. TEA, CHINESE MODE AND CHINESE RECIPES 

While in the house of Mr. Pun Sung Sang, a very courteous and 
prominent silk merchant of Bombay, India, I was very much interested 
in having explained to me many of the high-class Chinese methods 
of preparing tea, and also their meals. Mr. Pun is of the firm of 
Yan Shun & Co. His father's and grandfather's firms were among the 
thirteen most reputable houses selected and given title by the Chinese 
Government to trade with foreigners when Canton was the only open port, 
sixty odd years ago, and did a large business with the American firm of 
Russel & Co. It goes without saying that the Chinese are tea-drinking 
people, and they indulge. in the beverage from early morning till bed- 
time. As soon as invited to be seated, a cup of delicious tea, poured 
from an artificially ornamented box-like pot, taken from a wooden box, 
was handed to me. I asked Mr. Pun's permission to examine the box, 
which he courteously gave. It is of artistically decorated bamboo 
(Malay mambu), large enough to hold the tea vessel for which it is made 
(usually a gallon) ; then a double piece of felt cloth, evenly padded with 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECIPES 1023 

cotton to three inches in thickness, exactly fits interior all round (as 
well as bottom) up to the brim; the inner covering is carefully sewed up 
and tightly arranged in the basket or box; the cover is similarly treated 
and made to properly fit inside, and a neat knot of ribbon is fastened 
in centre of top of cover as a handle. 

A porcelain pot like a water pitcher fits tightly in the box and is 
always scalded before tea is poured in, then tea is made in the usual 
way. When sufficiently infused it is immediately strained into the pot, 
and the box is then placed in a handy part of the room for frequent use. 
Mr. Pun informed me that tea made as here described keeps in an 
excellent, hot condition for twelve hours. The tea is poured out and 
served in beautifully decorated thin cups a little larger than demi- 
tasses. I have been in every china ware store in Chinatown, New York, 
and elsewhere, but I could not find the same article in this country. 
The nearest to it was in the stores of Wing Yee Lang & Co., 18 Pell 
Street., Soy Kee & Co., 7 Mott Street., and a large importing house of 
Grand Street. 



No. 3318 HINDUSTAN CURRY POWDER 

Hindustan Curry Powder is composed of 27 of the best and purest 
ingredients obtainable. 

My purpose to devise and offer to the public a reliable, good, mild, 
pure curry powder was one of the principal objects of the exhaustive 
research I made in all the important cities of the Orient, the best 
and most renowned curry fields of India in particular, and the result 
of the study and experimenting has enabled me to put on the market

1024 THE INTERN ATICNAL COOK BOOK 

CHINESE MEALTIME AND CUSTOMS 

(In the higher family circles.) 

Breakfast is usually partaken of between 9 and 10 A. M., the items 
consisting of four or five dishes: Soup, made of pork, vegetables or of 
dried fish. Fish, fried or boiled, with sauces; also fish prepared by 
steam. Eggs, fried or prepared by steam. Vegetables, boiled or fried, 
of various sorts. Rice, boiled in an iron pan, well dried and brought 
to table with other articles. Spoons are used for soup, but knives and 
forks are never used. Rice is most essential at all meals. A pair of 
chop-sticks are always used by each person in picking up the articles 
before them. None of the eatables are ever touched with the hands. 
Butter is never used for cooking purposes, ground nut oil is used instead. 

Luncheon is usually served between one and two o'clock, p. M. It is 
a very light meal, consisting of cakes, sweets or rice canju. 

Dinner, as a rule, is partaken of between 5 and 6 P. M. The 
courses are about the same as for breakfast, but with some addition, 
such as boiled or fried fowl or steamed duck, etc. When guests are 
invited it is usually for dinner. On the table there are always about 
eight small dishes full of fresh and dried fruits and cold meats, so that 
the guests can help themselves to whatever they like. Then all the 
courses are brought in by servants, and with chop-sticks each helps 
himself. Other dishes besides those mentioned are often served for 
dinner, such as shark-fins, birds'-nests, fishmams, beche-de-mer, dry 
shellfish, turtle, birds, dried mushrooms, etc. 

Shark-fins are first boiled in water for an hour, then removed, plunged 
in cold water for a few minutes, taken up, skinned, scaled and set to 
boil again until considerably softer. After this the fins are placed in a 
vessel with a little fowl broth or a small thoroughly cleaned duck, then 
cooked (steamed) in the pan until very soft. Slices of ham are then 
placed over all and served. 

Birds'-nests are first thoroughly cleaned, carefully cleared of every 
particle of feather, washed carefully and wiped dry, placed in a vessel 
with a little fowl broth, then the vessel is placed in a pan to steam until 
quite soft. After this some ham, cut in small, thin pieces, is added 
shortly before serving, which gives an excellent taste. This dish is 
highly appreciated, and considered one of the most delicious articles of 
food in China. 

Fishmams are cut into one-inch pieces, thoroughly cleaned and 
wiped, then fried in oil, when they will swell considerably. They are 
next removed, boiled in water till free of the oil taste, then transferred 
into a vessel with fowl broth and cooked in a steaming pan. 

Beche-de-mer (hoi tarn) trepang (sea cucumber or sea slug). 
This powerful dry fish is and has been in very high favour not only in 
China but all over India as well. I was informed on very high authority 
that it was well known that by continuing to partake of bche-de-mer 
it effectively enabled women who had been married several years and 
remained childless to become mothers competent persons having put 



SUPPLEMENTARY RECIPES 1025 

the treatment to successful tests. The fish is soaked in several changes 
of cold water for a full day (twenty-four hours), removed and properly 
cleaned, then it is boiled in two different waters till free from lime taste. 
After this it is put in a vessel with a good-sized, well-cleaned pigeon or a 
small duck, with some broth, and steamed in a pan until thoroughly 
soft, then served. It is also very extensively eaten by persons affected 
with weak eyesight, and is recommended by eminent physicians. 

Dry shellfish are first boiled in water for thirty minutes, removed, 
thoroughly cleaned, placed in a vessel and steamed in a pan with some 
broth till nice and soft. 

Turtles are cut in pieces a little larger than for soup, carefully cleaned, 
placed in a double pan or vessel with broth, some dried mushrooms 
added, as well as pieces of ham, then steamed till cooked. 

Birds are prepared in various ways roasted, boiled or steamed, with 
broth. 

Dried mushrooms are carefully washed in cold water, drained, fried 
in a pan with lard for about twenty minutes, transferred into a small pan 
with broth, then cooked until soft. . 

In preparing by steam they place a deep pan on the fire with boiling 
water, bain-marie-like, then a vessel containing the food is placed in it, 
and a wooden cover to completely cover pan is placed over in order to 
avoid evaporation. It is then allowed to steam. Sauce is always 
served with every course. 

3319. CHICKEN SAUTE", LANIER 

Neatly dean and wipe two spring chickens of one and a quarter or 
a half pounds, and cut them into four pieces each. Heat an ounce 
melted butter in a saute pan and lay pieces in, skin side downward. 
Add six sound, medium-sized, peeled and cleaned, fresh whole mush- 
rooms, season with light teaspoon salt, two saltspoons white pepper and 
three saltspoons Oriental curry powder, if at hand, tightly cover pan and 
gently cook on a moderate fire for ten minutes or until a nice golden 
colour, then turn pieces of chicken as well as mushrooms on the other 
side and let gently cook for five minutes. Add now two medium-sized 
peeled and finely chopped shallots, half a medium-sized, finely chopped 
green pepper, and mix the whole well together with a wooden spoon while 
cooking for two minutes. Pour in a half gill good sherry wine and a 
few drops of cognac, shuffle contents of pan for two minutes, pour 
in a half pint cream (not very thick), cover and let cook again for ten 
minutes, slightly shuffling meanwhile. Dilute two egg yolku with two 
tablespoons cream, an ounce good butter, and gradually add to chicken, 
being careful to briskly shuffle contents of pan meanwhile, but do not 
allow to boil again. Dress chicken on a hot serving or chafing dish and 
send to table with six freshly prepared Graham-bread toasts separately.
