THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

CANDIES 

I submit the following with the caution that damp 
or sultry weather will often affect the making of candies. 
Sometimes a failure due to these weather conditions will 
discourage the amateur candymaker. Select, there- 
fore, a bright day for your first attempt. After you have 
made certain candies once or twice you will have gained 
the necessary judgment to gauge the syrups. 

I do not give the directions for use of a thermometer, 
as the home candymakers are very seldom provided 
with one. 

Fondant is the basis for chocolate creams, mint, 
sassafras and wintergreen tablets and many other 
candies. 

After it is made it is better to let it stand twenty- 
four hours before using. Set aside in a bowl and cover 
with a piece of muslin. 

FONDANT FOR CANDIES 

MATERIALS : 

2 cupfuls granulated sugar ^ cupful water 
Some confectioners sugar 

PREPARATION : 

Boil the granulated sugar and water until the syrup 
will spin a heavy thread when dropped into ice water. 

Carefully pour the syrup out on large platter. 
When cool enough to bear the finger in it, stir the 
mixture until white and creamy. Dust the bread 
board or the platter with the confectioners sugar, turn 
the mixture onto it and knead as you would bread 
dough until it is smooth. It is much improved by 
standing 24 hours. To do this place in a bowl, cover 
and keep in cool place. 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

CHOCOLATE CREAMS 
To make the chocolate creams, shape the fondant 
into required shapes and sizes, let stand half a day, 
then dip them into melted unsweetened chocolate. 

PULLED MOLASSES CANDY 
MATERIALS : 

Yi pint molasses 3 tablespoons vinegar 

1 pound brown sugar Yz teaspoon soda 

Yz pint water Y^ teaspoon cream of tartar 

PREPARATION: 

Put molasses, sugar, water and vinegar in a sauce- 
pan and stir the ingredients until they reach the 
boiling point, add the cream of tartar and boil until 
it is very brittle when dropped into ice water. Stir 
occasionally and watch carefully to prevent scorch- 
ing. Now add the butter and soda. Pour on a 
greased marble slab or into a pan and when sufficiently 
cool to handle pull until light in color. 

Cut in desired shapes. 

BUTTER CUPS 

The recipe for molasses candy may be made into 
Butter Cups. Roll the candy into long thin strips, fill 
the center with nut cheese and place two strips to- 
gether and cut with a sharp knife or shears into the 
Butter Cups. 

NUT CHEESE 
MATERIALS : 

Ya, pound Brazil nuts Y2. pound figs 

Y^ pound almonds Y2. pound seeded raisins 

Y2. pound pecans Ya pound dates 

PREPARATION: 

Stone the dates, blanch the almonds and Brazil 
nuts. Put all through the food grinder, making a soft 
paste. 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

GLORIA FUDGE 
MATERIALS: 

Yz cup Karo or corn syrup Water enough to barely dis- 
2 cups granulated sugar solve sugar 

Whites of 2 eggs ^ level teaspoon Calumet 

Baking Powder 

PREPARATION : 

Boil the syrup, sugar and water until a few drops 
will crack in ice water. Be very sure that it reaches this 
stage before removing from fire. 

Have ready a well-chilled crock or bowl with the 
whites of two eggs stiffly beaten with the Calumet 
Baking Powder. Pour over the syrup in a thin stream, 
beating all the time. Beat until a spoonful of the mix- 
ture dropped back into the bowl will retain its shape 
on the surface of the mixture. Then pour quickly into 
well greased shallow pan and mark off in sections. 
When set, cut into pieces an inch square. 

Chopped pecans or pistachio nuts may be added at 
the last minute before turning the mixture into the pan. 
When properly made, it has a porous consistency and 
the surface will be dry, but not tough, and it is one of 
the most delicious of homemade candies. 

STUFFED PRUNES 
(A delicious Confection) 

Select from a saucepan of well cooked prunes as 
many perfect unbroken ones as desired. Drain them 
and rinse quickly and drain again. Place them in a 
warm oven to dry off. Remove the stones and fill with 
the following mixture : 

Place in a saucepan one cup of sugar and water to 
dissolve. Cook till the syrup will form soft ball in ice 
water. Remove from the fire and beat into it a heaping 
tablespoon of preserved or crystallized ginger which has 
been put through a food chopper. Add enough chopped 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

pecans to fill the mixture. Stuff the prunes with this 
and roll them in sugar. 

Fondant, of course, is better to use for the stuffing 
if a supply is convenient. But as it takes more time to 
prepare, the quickly prepared sugar will be found more 
convenient. 

STUFFED DATES 

Prepare the dates by washing dates and removing 
the pits. Then proceed as with Stuffed Prunes. 

CANDIED GRAPE FRUIT PEEL 

Cut the peel in quarter sections. Then carefully peel 
from the fruit. Let stand over night in cold water, to 
which salt is added, a teaspoon to a quart. Weigh the 
peel. Cook it in water to cover until tender. Then 
drain. 

Make a syrup of sugar equal in weight to the peel 
and a half cup of water to each cup of sugar. Skim and 
put in the peel. Let simmer until the syrup is reduced. 
Then cook, and very gently stir until the peel is well 
coated with the syrup. Spread the peel on plates to 
dry. 

ORANGE STRAWS 
(A Confection) 

The skins of thick-skinned oranges are, of course, 
the best for this purpose. 

Remove the orange skin in quarters, cutting from 
stem to blossom end. Cut these pieces in strips about 
three-eighths of an inch in the center and tapering at 
the ends, following out the original shape of the section. 
Throw these strips into salted water and boil till tender. 
The proportion of salt is one level tablespoonful to one 
quart of water. This is the critical point. They must 
not be soft or they will be ruined. They must be 
thoroughly cooked, and yet must be firm enough to re- 
tain their shape. A piece when held up in the hand 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

should retain its shape and not fall limp. The salt in 
the water removes any bitter taste from the inner peel. 

Skim from the water into a colander. Rinse them in 
cold water, drain and spread on a towel to dry. The 
drier the better. 

Make a thick rich syrup of granulated sugar and 
water as thick as you can without candying. Into this 
drop the peel, only cooking as much at a time as can be 
taken care of. When the peel looks clear and as though 
well saturated with the syrup, remove with a skimmer 
and drain thoroughly. 

Roll each piece in powdered sugar and set on a 
platter to dry. In an hour it should be perfectly firm 
and hard. It will be necessary to add sugar to the syrup, 
as the moisture from the peel will cook out into it. 

These are delicious to serve with the after-dinner 
coffee or as a bonbon. 

CANDY FAIRIES 
MATERIALS; 

2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup water 

1 cup chopped nuts 2 egg whites 
PREPARATION : 

Boil the sugar and water until the syrup forms a 
heavy thread. Beat the egg whites very stiff. Pour the 
syrup over the eggs, beating all the time until a beater 
full will retain its shape on the surface of the mass. Then 
add the nuts and drop in spoonfuls on an oiled paper or 
platter. 

ICE CREAM CANDY 
MATERIALS: 

2 cups granulated sugar % cup water 

% cup vinegar 1 or 2 drops of flavoring 

2 teaspoons glycerine 
PREPARATION : 

Boil the water, sugar, vinegar and glycerine together 
until some dropped in ice water will crack. Take from 
the fire and when ceased bubbling add flavoring.

will hold its shape. 

Have the fruit and nuts prepared beforehand and 
add them to the mixture. 

Drop by spoonfuls onto a buttered tin or paper and 
allow to stand until the outside is dry enough to handle. 
This is a very easily made and satisfactory confection. 

PEANUT SQUARES 
MATERIALS: 

2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup crushed peanuts 
1 teaspoonful salt 

PREPARATION: 

Heat an iron frying pan, put in sugar, stir constantly 
until melted. Have peanuts thoroughly warmed in

SANDWICHES 

SANDWICH HINTS 

Very little ingenuity is required to provide a variety 
of sandwiches. It was one housewife's boast that she 
could serve a salad every day of the year and have no 
two just alike, and the same may be claimed of the 
sandwich. 

Supplying, as they do, both nourishment and appe- 
tizer, the housewife should perfect herself in the mak- 
ing of dainty, nutritious sandwiches. Standing at the 
head in the list of foods, bread is called the "staff of 
life," but it is falling away from its proper place in the 
dietary. 

How few children now are satisfied with a piece 
of bread and butter, neglecting it at the table and re- 
fusing it as a lunch between meals. But when daintily 
arranged, converted into sandwiches, it appeals to all 
and is truly the "staff of life." 

Sandwiches may be made with such a variety of fill- 
ings. Meats, nuts, vegetables, fruits, eggs and cheese 
form the basis for much variation. Through the hot 
summer months meats are not as much used as eggs and 
cheese. 

Appearance may demand the trimming off of the 
crusts from the bread slices, but it is a wasteful practice, 
as the crust is the best part of the bread. 

Perhaps the following recipes will give a hint for 
variety. 

SANDWICHES FOR OUTINGS AND 

CHILDREN'S LUNCHES 

In making up sandwiches to be carried to picnics 
or outings, wrap each in thin waxed paper. This can 

13 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

be obtained at the department stores and is prepared 
expressly for this purpose. Pack them closely together 
and lay some of the large lettuce leaves between to fur- 
nish moisture for them. Then cover all with a napkin. 

PIMENTO AND EGG SANDWICH 

Make a paste of the yolks of hard boiled eggs and 
three times the quantity of cream cheese, soften with 
mayonnaise dressing, and add the finely chopped 
whites. Spread upon rounds of bread, sliced three- 
quarters of an inch thick. Place in the center of each 
stuffed olives and around these minced pimentos. Serve 
on crisp lettuce leaves. 

CAVIAR SANDWICH 

Have some thin slices of rye bread spread sparingly 
with butter, spread with caviar. Serve on individual 
plates, with a tablespoon of minced onion (mince the 
onion with a knife) and a quarter of lemon on each 
plate. A knife should accompany each plate. 

ROSE SANDWICHES 

Use thin-sliced bread. Spread with a very little 
butter (or none) adding a thin layer of cream cheese, 
then stiff raspberry jam. Cut the bread from each cor- 
ner (diagonally) across, twice, forming triangles, or 
with cutters in rounds. 

CHERRY SANDWICHES 

Mix equal parts of candied or Maraschino cherries, 
and chestnuts which have been boiled, blanched, and 
simmered in a little syrup (letting stand in this until 
cold). Spread long narrow saltines or thin bread and 
butter with the mixture; placing two together and, if 

14 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

bread is used, cutting diagonally to form triangular 
sandwiches. A sprinkling of cress will add piquancy to 
the flavor. 

WATERCRESS SANDWICH 

Prepare slices of fresh white bread by spreading 
with soft butter. Mince some crisp watercress, sprinkle 
it with salt and pepper, then with olive or peanut oil and 
then with vinegar. 

Toss with two forks until all of the leaves are sea- 
soned, spread the cress evenly over the slices of bread 
and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Cut each slice in 
halves. 

LETTUCE SANDWICH 

Thin oblong slices of buttered bread with a filling 
of lettuce leaves dipped in a mayonnaise dressing and 
sprinkled with Parmesan or grated cream cheese. 

LETTUCE SALAD SANDWICH 

Shred with the shears some nice crisp leaves of head 
lettuce. Chop fine some chives or the green tops of 
onions. Toss the two together. Sprinkle with salt and 
pepper and a very little powdered sugar. 

Pour over the greens some olive oil, enough to coat 
them well. Then sprinkle with vinegar, just a very 
little. 

Butter slices of fresh whole wheat bread and place 
each two together with the lettuce filling between. 
Press closely together, cut in three strips. 

These sandwiches cannot be kept fresh long and 
should be eaten at once to be appetizing. The bread 
also should be not over a day old. 

15 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

OLIVE AND NUT SANDWICH 

Cut and butter very lightly thin slices of rye bread. 
Chop fine some pecan or walnut meats and some stuffed 
olives. Have twice as many olives as nut meats. Com- 
bine with a little mayonnaise dressing. Spread the 
bread with the mixture. Press two slices together, hav- 
ing the mixture between and on the top. Serve on a 
plate lined with rounds of lettuce leaves. 

RIBBON SANDWICH 

Take three square thin slices of white bread and two 
corresponding slices of entire wheat bread. Butter 
them and place between each two slices, the white bread 
being on the outside, a filling made of egg paste. 

Take a sharp knife and cut crosswise into thin slices, 
each five, three white, two entire wheat, slices of bread 
cut into six sandwiches. Egg paste is prepared by 
creaming the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs and add- 
ing two tablespoons of salad dressing with pepper and 
salt to taste. 

CLUB SANDWICH 

Three slices of bread, toasted and buttered are the 
basis of a club sandwich. Remove the crusts. Place a 
lettuce leaf on the lower slice and on its top place slices 
of chicken breast, and minced green pepper. Then put 
another slice of toast on top of that with another leaf 
of lettuce followed by thin slices of broiled breakfast 
bacon topped with the third slice of toasted bread. Fin- 
ish the sandvv^ich with thin slices (lengthwise) of small 
pickles on top of the last slice of toast. The toasted 
bread and the bacon should be hot. 

A small dill pickle sliced in five thin strips almost 
to the stem and the strips spread out is another accom- 
paniment for a club sandwich. 

16 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

SALAD SANDWICH 

Mix a small quantity of mayonnaise dressing with 
a quantity of finely minced chicken or any preferred 
meat. Lay the salad between crisp lettuce leaves and 
cover with thin slices of white bread. 

NUT AND FRUIT CHEESE 

(Sandwiches) 

The fruit and nut cheese makes a sandwich filling 
that is rich in nutrition, is most palatable and just the 
thing for the picnic basket. 

MATERIALS; 

Yz pound figs 1 pound pecans 

Yi. pound raisins 1 pound almonds 

Yz pound dates ^ pound Brazil nuts 

Fruit juice of oranges and lemons or grape juice to 
make a mixture to spread easily. 
PREPARATION : 

Wash the figs and dates and stone the latter. Blanch 
the almonds. Put all the fruit and nuts through the 
food chopper. Mix with the fruit juice until easily 
spread. 

Butter thin slices of bread very sparingly. Spread 
the cheese between two slices. Press together and cut 
in strips. 

CHEESE SANDWICH 

With a firm knife combine a rich cream cheese or 
fromage de Brie with one-third as much butter. When 
well creamed spread on thin slices of rye bread. 
Sprinkle minced green pepper over the cheese, or stuffed 
olives in slices. Press another slice to this, trim the 
edges, cut once through the center. 

17 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

CHEESE AND NUT SANDWICH 

Chop pecan or hickory nuts, mix with an equal 
quantity of Neufchatel cheese, add a dash of paprika, 
spread between thin slices of whole wheat bread. A 
heart leaf of head lettuce dipped in French dressing is 
a palatable addition placed between the slices. 

EGG MAYONNAISE SANDWICH 

Hard boil sufficient eggs, drop immediately into cold 
water and remove the shells. Separate the yolks from 
the whites. Put the whites through the food chopper 
first, then the yolks. Mix with enough mayonnaise 
dressing to hold together. 

Butter thin slices of bread, spread with the egg 
mixture, place a crisp leaf of head lettuce on it and then 
another slice of bread. 

These are particularly dainty if, after putting to- 
gether, they are cut out with a large biscuit cutter. 

GOLDEN RULE SPECIAL 

MATERIALS : 

Thin slices white bread cut Finely shredded lettuce or 

from a large loaf. green pepper. 

Plain Mayonnaise or some Sliced radishes 
Thousand Island Dress- Sliced tomatoes 
ing. 
PREPARATION : 

Cut the slices of bread in two. On every other 
half spread the dressing. If plain Mayonnaise is used 
add a little tomato sauce. Place the half slices of 
tomato in the dressing, sprinkle with the shredded let- 
tuce and cover with the other half slice of bread. 

Trim the edges neatly. Cut slices of radishes in 
two, place diagonally across each sandwich, alternat- 
ing the position. 

Serve with curled or chilled celery hearts.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PRESERVING 

STERILIZATION 

This means the proper heat applied to all vessels, 
covers and rubber rings to prevent contamination of 
the contents of the jars or cans. 

This is imperative in the preservation of fruits or 
vegetables, when the first named preservatives are ab- 
sent, or are present in only small quantities, viz: cin- 
namon, sugar, salt and vinegar. 

No cooking, partial cooking, and thorough cooking, 
represent the methods of preserving fruits. 

STERILIZATION IN CANNING VEGETABLES 

Sterilization is the secret of successful canning. 
Vegetables differ from fruits in the sterilization process 
as the form of bacteria which are peculiar to vegetables 
are not entirely destroyed in one process. Long con- 
tinued cooking may destroy this form of bacteria, but 
in the longer cooking the flavor of the vegetable may 
be destroyed. This applies particularly to tomatoes. 

The market supplies canning outfits with adequate 
directions. For the needs of the small family, covered 
kettles, fireless cookers or the range ovens may be used. 
The wash boiler is as good as anything for this purpose, 
its only fault being its awkward depth. 

If only one pint cans are used, the simplest method 
is to make use of the covered roaster and the range 
oven. 

Two processes are recommended in sterilizing. The 
first process and the most reliable is to boil the filled 
glass jars three successive days. The succeeding days 
boil one hour, bringing to the boiling point gradually 
so as to avoid breakage of containers. 

For canning of vegetables the glass jars with glass 
covers and patent clamps are most efficient. 

19 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

The reason for the repeated cooking process is due 
to the presence of spores from which the bacteria de- 
velop. Spores may not be killed or their growth ar- 
rested. It is claimed that only when they have 
developed into bacteria, and the bacteria killed, that 
they are entirely eliminated. The spores germinate 
over night and the second boiling kills this crop before 
they develop resistent spores. The third day cooking 
is to make assurance doubly sure. 

A second method of canning has lately sprung into 
notice, which involves a more complicated and less sure 
method. The principle rests upon eliminating the 
danger of spores by sudden plunge from extreme heat 
to extreme cold, and for exact manipulation would re- 
quire the patented apparatus. 

PRESERVING HINTS 

Acid of vinegar is a preservative. 

Some fruits have an acid similar in this property to 
vinegar. 

Pieplant and cranberries may be put up in sterilized 
jars and preserved without cooking. The water should 
be sterilized and then cooled. 

Sugar and salt are preservatives if enough of either 
is used. 

Among spices true cinnamon leads in preservative 
property. 

Avoid the use of special preserving compounds, as 
they are sometimes unsafe and always unnecessary. 

Nothing is so easy and effective as perfect steriliza- 
tion. 

CANNING VEGETABLES 

One general rule must be observed in putting up 
almost all vegetables, viz: Subjecting them to the 

30 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

sterilization process at least twice after the first process, 
allowing twenty-four hours to elapse between processes. 

This is made necessary by the later developments of 
the spores of some bacteria. 

Bacteria may be destroyed in the first process but 
the spores may not and consequently must be given time 
to develop and then subjected to sterilization.

PINEAPPLE VINEGAR 
Pineapple parings should never be thrown away as 
there is no finer vinegar in the world in flavor and color 
than that made from pineapples. The fruit parings 
(fruit may also be added) should be placed in crocks 
and covered with water, sugar or syrup being added in 
quantity according to the condition of the fruit, and 
allowed to ferment thoroughly. When this has been 
accomplished — ^watched and skimmed meantime — the 
vinegar must be strained from the fruit and placed in 
jars or bottles. 

CIDER VINEGAR 

As apples are used in the kitchen, boil the skins and 
cores in as little water as possible, sweeten with a little 
molasses, and let ferment. 

23 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Apples which are not keeping well may be boiled and 
the liquor strained off, a little molasses added, and let 
ferment. With crab apples reduce the pressed juice one- 
third, then treat as above. 

APPLE VINEGAR 

To one gallon apple peelings and cores, add two pails 
boiled rain water. When soured, drain and to each gal- 
lon of this liquor add one cup molasses and a piece of 
brown paper and two dry beans or two kernels of corn, 
when these sprout, the fermentation begins. 

In making vinegar it is a mistake to add the 
"mother" until after fermentation is over as the 
"mother" will prevent fermentation. 

VINEGAR 

Vinegar (Vin aigre) as its name implies was made 
originally from sour wine in which the alcoholic fermen- 
tation had been changed to produce acetic acid. 

This can be done by introducing "mother" of vinegar. 
The true wine vinegars and the malt vinegars are the 
safest vinegars to buy. Cider vinegar is popular on 
account of its milder fruity flavor, but if not made in the 
home is apt to be made from materials that are distress- 
ingly unclean. 

In France and Germany pure vinegar is understood 
to be made from wine, while in England vinegar means 
malt vinegar. 

Tarragon vinegar is white wine vinegar flavored 
with the leaves of tarragon. It is used most frequently 
for seasoning sour sauces and for salad. Either the 
green or dried leaves may be used. 

PICKLING IN BRINE 

An old time method of preserving some of the 
vegetables for pickling holds very good now, where 

24 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

large families or numbers have to be provided for, and 
also when pressed for time in the season when these 
varieties are being marketed. 

In the former case there is quite a saving of vinegar 
and seasonings and in the latter it provides a method 
of preservation until more time can be devoted to 
pickling. 

Among the vegetables that can be so treated are: 
cucumbers, green tomatoes, green peppers and string 
beans. 

Select small cucumbers, small tomatoes and young 
string beans. 

Put a layer of salt in the bottom of a large jar 
or wooden keg and then the vegetables that you wish 
to keep. 

The salt should be about a quarter of an inch thick. 
Lay in layers alternately with salt on top. 

Place a board on top of the vegetable and pour 
around some water to dissolve the salt — about one 
quart. 

A small piece of alum will assist in crisping cucum- 
bers, but has no preserving quality. Horseradish will 
prevent mold. 

Place a cloth and then the fitted cover of the vessel. 

When wanted for use take out what is required 
and replace covers carefully. 

Soak in water twenty-four hours and then use 
vinegar and spices as desired. 

Another method is to prepare a brine strong enough 
to hold up an egg, pouring it over the vegetables after 
the vessel has been filled. 

CUCUMBERS, STRING BEANS, GREEN AND 
RED PEPPERS, PICKLED IN BRINE 

Make a brine of boiling water and coarse salt strong 
enough to float a fresh egg. Place the vegetables to be 

25 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

kept in stone jars or half gallon mason jars, cover with 
the cold brine. When using stone jars it will be found 
necessary to place a plate inverted over the vegetables 
to hold them under the brine. Cover the jars but seal- 
ing is not necessary.

brine for thirty-six hours. 

26 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Take from the brine and rinse, fill each half with 
raw, chopped, spiced cabbage. Place the halves to- 
gether and tie with twine. 

Place in a jar close together and cover with a hot 
spiced vinegar. Pour off every other day for three days 
without disturbing the peppers, and heat and return to 
the jar. 

PICKLED WALNUTS 
(Old English Recipe) 

The walnuts must be gathered while they are tender 
enough to run the darning needle through them — 
thick green outer rind and all. 

Place them in stone jars and cover with a brine made 
in the proportion of one cup of salt to one quart of 
water. Change the brine every day for three days. 
Take them out, rub with a coarse towel. Lay in the 
sun until they are black, if so desired, if not, place them 
in cold water for one-half day. Then wipe dry and fill 
jars three-quarters full. To each quart of vinegar allow 
one cup of brown sugar, a dozen each of cloves, pepper 
corns, whole allspice and a small stick of cinnamon. 

Boil the spices in the vinegar, ten minutes, then 
strain out the spices and pour boiling hot over the nuts. 

Drain off each day for three days, scald and return. 
Cover closely and allow to stand a month to acquire 
ripeness of flavor. 

FRUITS 

The use of fruit in the diet is necessary for many 
reasons, chief among them is the dietetic balance by 
reason of the acids; citric, derived from citrus fruits as 
lemons, oranges, limes; the malic from apples, etc. 

It is commonly conceded that fruits are laxative, 
due in large measure to the salts in solution, and to the 
ballast supplied by the cellulose which is irritating in 
character, being crude fibre. 

27 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

The pineapple has a marked effect on digestion when 
eaten raw. Its quaUty is such that the juice from fresh 
pineapple will prevent gelatine from jellying. It di- 
gests the gelatine. This quality is destroyed by cook- 
ing. 

Small, imperfect or over-ripe fruit should be 
dropped into a kettle by itself and either used for jams 
or for fruit syrup. If for the latter mash through a 
strainer or ricer, then cook with sugar. 

Very seldom in jelly making is it necessary to use 
fruit juice and sugar in equal parts. 

A safe rule is six cups of juice to five cups of 
sugar. 

Cook the juice twenty minutes before adding the 
warmed sugar, and then boil about five minutes after 
the sugar has been added. 

Too long cooking of sugar with acid juice converts 
the sugar into levulose, from which it never will "jell." 

At no time do fruits require the care in canning that 
is necessary for vegetables. The bacteria peculiar to 
fruits is such that the boiling point reached in one 
process will entirely eliminate it. Some fruits, as cran- 
berries and pieplant, require nothing but cooled, boiled 
water and sterilized cans to preserve them. 

All other fruits require simple packing of sterilizing 
cans with the fruit and then filling to brim with either 
hot water or hot syrup. The tops are put in place with- 
out clamping. The cans are placed in a kettle or boiler 
with a rack covering the bottom. Water should cover 
two-thirds of the cans or jars. Time of cooking depends 
upon variety of fruit. 

SUGAR CRYSTALS IN JELLY 

The sugar crystals in jelly are formed sometimes 
when over-ripe fruit is used. The trouble often arises 
with grape jelly. 

28 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PECTOSE 

Pectose is the property of some fruit that makes it 
possible to manufacture jelly. 

Pectose is found in larger percentage in ripening 
fruit than in the over-ripe fruit, hence the desirability 
of nearly ripe fruit for jelly. In the process of ripen- 
ing the pectose is changed to pectines. 

The heat in cooking changes the pectose into pectin. 

The absence of pectose in some fruits and berries 
may be supplied by use of apples, which contain a large 
percent of pectose. 

SUGAR FOR JELLY 

The writer has not observed that there is any ap- 
preciable difference between cane and beet sugar in the 
making of jelly. It is conceded that the actual differ- 
ence in saccharine or sweetening property is two per 
cent. The action in making jelly is the same, as they 
belong to the same group, or true sugar. 

FRUIT JELLY 

The jellying of any juice depends upon the pectose 
contained in the fruit. Pieplant is deficient, hence the 
difficulty in making it jell. 

But let me put you on to a trade secret. Do you 
notice the labels on the store jelly read something like 
this: "The contents of this package are pure juice of 
strawberries and apples and cane sugar"? Which, being 
interpreted, means that the package labeled "Straw- 
berry Jelly," in compliance with the Pure Food law, 
which demands that the ingredients be printed on the 
label, is not pure strawberry jelly. Strawberries are de- 
ficient also in that property of fruit known as pectose, 
and apples, which are generously supplied with that 
property, are levied upon to supply this want. 

29 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Apples, no matter how tasteless the variety, can 
always be relied upon to help out the housekeeper and 
manufacturer alike in this respect. And for this pur- 
pose use the insipid apples so that there may be no con- 
flict of flavor. Fruit that is not quite ripe is richer in 
pectose than entirely ripened fruit, as the pectose in 
the ripening process is changed to pectin and has lost 
some of the jellying property. In the absence of fresh 
apples a young woman has advised me that she used 
evaporated apples. 

But remember this, first, last and all the time, that 
the fruit juices must be well cooked, say about twenty 
minutes or more before adding the sugar, which should 
first be warmed in the oven. After adding sugar and 
juice has returned to the boiling point, five minutes boil- 
ing is all that is necessary in most cases. 

The piquant delicacy of the fruit flavor is destroyed 
by cooking too long with the sugar, and with a very acid 
juice the jellying property is destroyed by the turning 
of the sugar in long cooking with an acid into what is 
technically known as levulose. The sugar once turned 
to levulose is deadly sweet, but syrupy in its consistency. 

RED CURRANT JELLY 

Pick the fruit on a dry day before the currants are 
quite ripe. Stem them and scald over boiling water (in 
an inner vessel), then let the currants remain an hour 
over a moderate fire. Crush and pour into a jelly bag 
and let drip over night. Place juice in preserving kettle 
and let boil ten minutes. Skin, and when just at a boil 
stir in the sugar, having measured the cold juice and 
allowing for each full pint one pound sugar (heated). 
This should jell by the time sugar is dissolved, requir- 
ing never more than five minutes active boiling. 

Place jelly glasses on a folded wet towel to fill them. 

Another precaution against breaking is to place a 

30 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

silver spoon in the glass as the hot syrup is poured in. 
The richness of this jelly may be reduced and a more 
delicately flavored article result by adding strained juice 
of cooked apples or apple scraps to the juice of the cur- 
rants. 

GOOSEBERRY JELLY 

Use no water. Heat berries through and press to 
extract all juice. Strain and measure. To every six 
cups of juice measure five cups of sugar, putting the 
sugar in the oven to warm. When the juice has boiled 
five minutes add the sugar and cook about three minutes 
more. 

PIEPLANT JELLY 

For about every two pounds of pieplant provide 
three apples. Stew the apples with the skins on, after 
trimming away the bad spots. Cut up the pieplant with 
a large pair of shears, after having cleaned it well with 
a vegetable brush, without stripping off the outside. 

The pieplant cooks soft in a very few moments. 
Strain first through a fine sieve. Then put the juice in 
a jelly bag and drain without attempting to squeeze. 
The pulp left in the sieve can be used for pies, as there 
yet remains plenty of flavor, and may be canned hot for 
future use or made into marmalade. 

Work the apples after stewing tender, through the 
sieve and put the pulp into a jelly bag. As this takes 
much longer than the pieplant to prepare, this may be 
made ready some time before. Combine the juices of 
the apples and pieplant and boil steadily for about 
twenty minutes. Having measured the juice, add an 
equal amount of heated sugar, boil for about five 
minutes. Test as usual and when ready to jell pour 
into jelly glasses, set upon a wet towel. Do not cover 
and seal until cooled. 

31 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

BAR-LE-DUC CURRANTS 
(Imitation of the imported) 

Use either the red or white currants, selecting only 
the large, perfect fruit. 

With a fine invisible, new hairpin remove the seeds. 
If there is no desire to take that trouble, prick each one 
with a darning needle. 

Heat, mash and strain all of the small, inferior fruit, 
add it to the sugar. Make a syrup of sugar, water and 
strained fruit that will jell. 

Put in a small quantity of the seeded fruit into a like 
measure of the hot syrup, allow to boil up. Lift care- 
fully into glasses, the individual glasses being preferable. 
Allow to stand two or three days in the can. Then seal. 

SPICED CURRANTS 

Make a jam of two quarts of stemmed, cleaned cur- 
rants, six cups sugar, two cups vinegar, one level table- 
spoon each of cloves and cinnamon, one level teaspoon 
each salt, mace and ginger. 

Simmer until currants are shriveled and jam is 
thick. 

Bottle or can. 

CITRON— (Berry) 
Citron in its natural state is almost useless. To 
preserve for home use or market it must be dried and 
this should be done just before the fruit reaches ma- 
turity: while still green yet well filled out. Quarter it 
and place in fresh water a day and night. Drain and re- 
place water several times, then boil for forty minutes 
with a little alum and handful of citron leaves. Drain 
from this and boil in a mild syrup forty minutes longer. 
At the end of this time add sugar, pound for pound 
(with weight of citron). Let this boil for five or six 
minutes, then remove fruit and cook syrup until thicker. 
Dip the fruit in it again and boil as before, and once 

32 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

more repeat the process before placing the citron in the 
sun to dry. Fill the hollow sides with sugar and let 
fruit remain in the hottest sunshine for as many days as 
required to dry thoroughly, filling the hollows every 
few days with sugar. 

CITRON PRESERVES 

Make a heavy syrup in the proportion of three parts 
sugar and one part water. To each pound of sugar 
allow two thinly sliced lemons. 

Cut the citron in large cubes and cook in the syrup 
till clear. Remove to glass jars. Boil the syrup about 
five minutes longer and pour over the citron. 

This makes an exceedingly rich, delicately flavored 
preserve. 

PRESERVED GOOSEBERRIES 
Make a strong syrup, two pounds of sugar to a pint 
of water. Pierce gooseberries in several places, and 
put them in the syrup, then take them from the range 
and let the gooseberries remain in the syrup all night. 
Repeat twice, reheat, stopping just short of boiling 
point, again letting berries stand over night in syrup. 

While still cold place them in glass jars and pour the 
syrup over them. Place glass jars in water. Should 
the berries seem to be cracking before the water boils, 
remove the jars at once and seal, otherwise let stand 
until water is at boiling point. 

APPLE JELLY 

Wash the apples carefully as the skins and cores 
free from bad spots are as important as the pulp of the 
apple. 

Peel and core the apple, putting all that is good of 
the scraps into a separate preserving kettle. Add 
enough water to each kettle to half cover the contents. 

Cook until tender. Strain the juice from the peel- 
ings and cores into the apple. Put the apple pulp 

33 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

through a sieve or fruit press and then into a jelly bag. 
Allow to hang and drain over night. Do not squeeze 
too dry as the remaining pulp makes excellent stock 
for apple pies and sauces or can be made into apple 
butter. 

To every six cupfuls of juice measure five cupfuls 
of granulated sugar. Place sugar where it will heat 
through without melting. 

Put the juice in a wide open kettle and boil rapidly 
about twenty minutes. Add the heated sugar and when 
the syrup has again come to the boiling point allow 
to cook about five minutes. 

Take a spoonful or so and drop onto a chilled saucer 
to try. When ready to jell place your jelly glasses on 
folded wet towels. To further safeguard the glasses 
it is well to place a silver spoon in the glass before pour- 
ing in the hot jelly. 

Another precaution is to pour only a few spoon- 
fuls in each glass at first. 

Do not cover until cooled, when the glasses may 
be covered with parafine or with the glass covers. 

CRAB APPLE JELLY 

Crab apples may be made into jelly, the process 
being the same as with apple jelly. 

APPLE BUTTER 

Take the pulp remaining from the apple jelly, add 
two-thirds as much sugar as pulp and plenty of spices 
if desired. Add sufficient water to thin to consistency 
of sauce. Cook until thick, which requires several hours 
over a slow fire. Care must be exercised to avoid 
scorching. The apple butter may be turned into pint 
economy jars and sealed as usual. 
TO PRESERVE APPLES AND APPLE PULP 

(Unsweetened) 

Add sufficient water to apples or apple pulp to re- 
semble apple sauce. Cook until thoroughly well 

34 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Close the peach with tooth-picks and stock two or three 
heated through. 

Sterilize and heat pint Mason jars by standing in 
a deep pan of water over the fire. It is well to have a 
rack in bottom of the pan to prevent the glass from 
breaking. 

Put the rubbers in place, fill the jars with the boil- 
ing hot fruit. If the pulp has cooked quite thick it 
may be necessary to put a tablespoonful of boiling 
water on the top to insure no open spaces between the 
contents and the cover. Put on the sterilized covers, 
not screwing them down completely. Cover over all 
and allow to boil rapidly for half an hour. Then fasten 
down the covers and remove from pan. 

This is an economical method of taking care of the 
pulp or of apples for pies. The flavor is much better 
for pie or sauce making, when canned with sugar. 

PRESERVED QUINCES 

Quinces may be preserved whole, halved, quartered, 
or sliced across in rings. Cook the fruit till tender in 
water acidulated with citric acid, then place in a syrup 
made with one part of water to three of sugar. When 
at boiling point let remain one minute if cut; if whole, 
for five or six minutes, then fill jars and seal at once. 
This may be varied with apples, or by other fruits as 
with Quince Marmalade. 

PEARS PRESERVED WITH GINGER 
OR LEMON 

Peel and quarter pears, weigh and allow a quarter 
pound of green ginger (scraped) to each pound of fruit. 
Have a syrup prepared as for preserves and in this lay 
the pears and ginger, proceeding as with preserves. 
Lemon peel may be used instead of ginger. 

35 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

BAKED PRESERVED PEARS 

Any small, hard pears may be baked for preserving 
with the best results. Place in layers in a crock with 
some lemon peel; cover with water and molasses, half 
and half ; set on the back of the stove all night and bake 
all next day in a slow oven. Longer cooking will not 
impair but improve if done slowly enough. The fruit 
will become dark red in color. Cook down the syrup; 
pour over the pears when done and the fruit has been 
placed in heated jars. 

PEAR CHIPS 

Wipe and stem hard pears. To four pounds allow 
three pounds of sugar, and an eighth pound green gin- 
ger root grated. Slice thin in bits and let stand twelve 
hours, then cook with juice and rind of two lemons, 
letting come slowly to a boil and cooking perhaps three 
hours, till clear and thick. 

PICKLED PEACHES 

For sufficient for two-gallon jar use twenty-five 
pounds of peaches and twelve pounds of sugar. (Rub 
the fuzz from the peaches with crash). In the preserv- 
ing kettle place two and one half quarts of vinegar with 
a handful of stick cinnamon, gradually adding the sugar 
until all is dissolved and boiling. Place the peaches, a 
few at a time, in this and when they are done skim them 
out and place in a stone jar. Boil down the syrup a 
little longer, then pour over the peaches and place a 
weight on them. In three days pour off the syrup and 
boil down till quite thick. The peaches will by this time 
have shrunk so that they will easily go into a two- 
gallon jar. Pour the thick syrup over them ; place plate 
on top and tie down with heavy paper. Cloves may be 
used instead of cinnamon or a mixture of spices as liked.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PEACH MANGO 
MATERIALS : 

5% dozen free stone 1 ounce cassia buds 

peaches Cloves and stick cinnamon 

1 ounce coriander seed 2% quarts vinegar (strong) 

(slightly broken) % quart water 

1 ounce celery seed 2% quarts sugar 

1 ounce white mustard % pound crystallized ginger 

seed (or preserved) 

% ounce black mustard 

seed 

PREPARATION: 

Rub the peaches with coarse towel or brush. To re- 
move the stones make a small incision in stem end 
and with a small, slim tweezers pull out the stone. If 
tweezers or a berry huller are not convenient, make an 
incision from end to end on one side of the peach and 
draw out the stone. Fill the cavity with the mixed 
seeds, putting in each peach two or three cassia buds 
and cloves. Fill the opening in the top of the peaches 
with a chunk of the ginger. A cheap tin teaspoon with 
both sides bent up makes a convenient scoop with 
which to fill them. As the peaches are filled pack 
closely, without jamming, in large jars. 

Make a rich syrup of the sugar, vinegar and water, 
adding the cinnamon and un-used seeds. 

Pour this syrup boiling hot over the peaches, turn 
inverted small plate over the peaches, cover the jar. 

Pour off and re-heat the syrup three successive days. 

You will find after the first day that the peaches have 
shrunk considerably, leaving an over abundance of 
syrup, which may be utilized in pickling green tomatoes, 
crab apples, or other fruits.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

FRUITS PRESERVED IN GRAPE JUICE 
(Miss Parloa) 

No sugar is needed when fruits are put up in grape 
juice. Heat grape juice till reduced one-third (six 
quarts reduced to four quarts), then place in it the pre- 
pared fruit (as for other preserves). Have it well cov- 
ered with juice and slowly boil till the fruit is translu- 
cent and tender, when place at once in heated jars and 
seal. 

PEACH BUTTER 

Pare, stone and crush very ripe peaches, and simmer 
in boiled cider which has been reduced to the thickness 
of molasses. To each gallon of the cider (after boiling) 
should be added a pound of sugar. To three quarts of 
the peach pulp allow a pint of the thick cider and sugar. 
This may be spiced if liked. 

PRESERVED PLUMS 

With the common wild or blue plums they may be 
steamed or dropped for a minute or two in boiling water 
to loosen the skin, which may then be easily removed. 
After this proceed as with other preserves. 

With small plums prick the skins in several places 
with a large needle to keep them from bursting, then 
place in layers in preserving kettle, allowing same 
amount of sugar. Let all come to a boil slowly; take 
out plums with skimmer ; drain, and spread on plates in 
sun. Cook down the syrup slowly for half an hour, 
skimming often; place plums in this for ten minutes 
(boiling them). Drain and dry as before and when 
quite cold place in jars, heated, pouring the boiling 
syrup over the fruit and sealing at once. 

BLACKBERRY AND CURRANT JAM— No. 1 

Take equal weight of blackberries and currants, add- 
ing pound for pound of sugar (and fruit) ; no water ; 

38 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

cooking slowly together till sugar is dissolved, when 
boil fast for thirty minutes. 

BLACKBERRY JAM— No. 2 
If blackberries alone are used take but three-fourths 
pound of sugar to each pound of fruit and proceed as 
above. 

THE PINEAPPLE 

A great mistake is often made in peeling this fruit 
whole by attempting to remove the eyes with the peel. 
The pineapple should first be sliced across, rind and all, 
according to the thickness desired, then each slice taken 
in turn, in the left hand, held with the rind toward 
one and pared with the right hand by means of a slim, 
sharp knife, inserting point and peeling downward, 
close to the rind. The eyes may now be easily and 
quickly removed with none of the usual awkward hack- 
ing and loss of juice attendant upon the ordinary 
method. 

PRESERVED PINEAPPLE (Sliced and Cooked) 

Cut in slices, then pare the fruit, placing alternate 
layers of pineapple and sugar (pound for pound) in 
preserving kettle. To each pound of fruit add one-half 
cup of water, pouring this in after fruit is placed with 
sugar. Heat to boiling point, then take out the slices 
and spread in the sun on dishes. Meantime gently boil 
the syrup for forty minutes. At the end of this time 
place pineapple again in kettle and cook all together 
for twenty minutes. Then remove the fruit, placing it 
in jars and pouring on it the boiling syrup ; seal at once. 

PRESERVED PINEAPPLE (Uncooked and Grated) 

In the northern climate, which is less trying to pre- 
served fruits than the extreme south, pineapple may be 
grated and preserved uncooked for culinary or medic- 

39 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

inal use. Use one pound of sugar to each pound of 
grated fruit and let stand twelve hours in covered jar 
in a cold place, if possible, on ice. Then place in jars 
which have been thoroughly sterilized. As an addi- 
tional safeguard the tops may be dipped in sealing wax 
or paraffin. 

CANNED PINEAPPLE (Without Sugar) 

Slice, pare, and heat thoroughly the ripe pineapples 
to be canned. When boiling remove and place imme- 
diately in sealed jars. 

CANNED PINEAPPLE (With Sugar) 

Use three-fourths pound of sugar to each pound of 
shredded fruit and to each pint of sugar one teacup of 
water. Heat through and when boiling, can. 

BLACKBERRY CATSUP 
(Delicious with Game) 

Cook berries, strain through fine sieve. Do not use 
a bag. Measure the pulp and to every four cups add 
one-half teaspoon each mace, white mustard and pep- 
per and one level tablespoon of cinnamon. Add vinegar 
to taste, and cook until of right consistency. Bottle 
and seal. 

CURRANT CATSUP 

Wash and stem the currants, retaining all fruit 
whether very ripe or green and undeveloped. To every 
half gallon of fruit, measure one quart of sugar and one 
pint of malt vinegar. Cook until reduced to thick syrup. 
Strain through a sieve and add one level tablespoon each 
of cloves, cinnamon and salt; and one level teaspoon 

40 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

each of mace and pepper. Boil ten minutes. Bottle and 
seal. 

ORANGE MARMALADE (Not bitter) 

One dozen oranges and four lemons. Shave very 
thin, using all except the center pith and seeds. Weigh 
the fruit, and to each pound add three pints of cold 
water. Set aside for twenty-four hours. Then put on 
the fire, and boil gently until the rind is tender. Pour 
off and set aside till the next day. Weigh and to each 
pound of material add one full pound of sugar. Cook 
until it thickens, then pour into glasses. One dozen 
oranges make about sixteen pints of marmalade and 
require about twelve pounds of sugar. 

PINEAPPLE MARMALADE 

Remove the skin and eyes from the pineapple. Then 
grate the pulp from the hard center. Weigh the pulp 
with the juice. Allow the juice of one lemon, three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of the pine- 
apple. Let the pineapple simmer over the fire until well 
scalded. Then add the lemon juice. Have the sugar 
heated in the oven, add it to the fruit and cook until no 
watery liquid separates from the mass when tested in 
a cold saucer. 

Store as jelly. 

GENUINE SCOTCH MARMALADE— (Copied) 

Take an equal number of bitter and sweet oranges 
and to each dozen allow three lemons. Cut the fruit 
as thin as possible, a mere shaving. Save the seeds, 
and let them stand twenty-four hours in a cup of water. 

To every pint of fruit add one pint of water. Let 
this stand forty-eight hours. Then boil quickly one 

41 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

hour. Allow it to stand another day. Then to every 
pound of fruit add one and one-fourth pounds of granu- 
lated sugar. Add the water from the seeds. Boil 
slowly for two hours. Put away in glass jars. 

TOMATO MARMALADE 

MATERIALS: 

4 quarts ripe tomatoes 1 cup raisins (seeded) 

6 lemons 4 pints granulated sugar 

PREPARATION: 

Peel and slice tomatoes. Slice lemons very thin. 
Put the materials into a kettle in alternating layers, 
cook one hour and then simmer slowly balance of time, 
till right consistency. 

Put up like jelly. This recipe makes about two and 
one-half quarts.

BEVERAGES 

COFFEE 

Explanatory : — Coffee heads the list of desirable bev- 
erages, being the most extensively used of any food 
beverage of the world. 

Green Coffee improves with age under proper condi- 
tions. 

Roasted Coffee on the contrary deteriorates. 

Roasted and Ground Coffees, like most of our food 
products, were for years badly adulterated, but that 
condition has been largely changed with the advent of 
our food laws. Our greatest protection is in a sealed 
package with the manufacturers name on the label. 

COFFEE CHAFF 

Coffee processes in the last decade have disclosed 
the means of eliminating the undesirable chaff to which 
was laid the only real objection to coffee effects, as the 
chaff contains the tannin, the effect of which, in coffee, 
has been considered injurious. 

The ordinary grinding process of a decade ago has 
undergone a revolution to the vast improvement of cof- 
fee. The better grades are now steel cut into uniform 
size instead of crushed into large and small particles 
and dust. This process has been the means of stan- 
dardizing coffee. 

Price in a measure determines the quality. 

COFFEE ECONOMY 

It is economy to use pulverized coffee of high grade 
rather than cheap grade coffee coarsely or indifferently 
ground. 

43 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

GROUND CHICORY 

is an improvement to cheap or inferior coffee so long as 
the housewife mixes it with the coffee herself. Not 
everyone can afford to purchase high priced foods. 
Therefore, we advise that ground chicory root (which 
resembles ground coffee) can be purchased of tea and 
coffee merchants. 

METHOD: — Add six level tablespoons of ground 
chicory root to each pound of ground coffee, mixing 
well. Make coffee in the usual way. 

COFFEE PERCOLATORS 

These standardize the coffee to be served, as they 
compel accurate measurement. 

LEFT-OVER COFFEE 

Good coffee may be kept hot for some time provided 
the grounds are removed ; properly made coffee may be 
reheated if poured off the grounds before setting it 
away. There is no reason why a housewife who would 
carefully put away a thimbleful of butter left on a plate 
should throw away two or three cups of left-over coffee. 

METHOD : — Pour the coffee from the grounds and 
set away. When coffee is prepared for the following 
meal, make the measure less by the amount of left-over 
coffee. Make coffee in usual way. Reheat but do not 
boil the cold coffee and when the regular coffee is ready 
for the table add the reheated coffee to it. 

PERFECT COFFEE 

Select a good quality of coffee, not necessarily the 
highest priced. Have the coffee ground fine and uni- 
form, steel cut preferred. Supply yourself with a granite 
coffee pot with a white lining or one of aluminum, al- 
ways keeping it as sweet and clean as your dinner plates. 

44 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

For six persons place six rounding tablespoons of coffee 
in the coffee pot. Pour over the coffee three pints (six 
cups) of boiled water. Place over a gentle flame and 
simmer five minutes after reaching the boiling point. 
Then mix about two teaspoons of egg in one-half cup 
of cold water and pour into the coffee to clear. 

To secure the perfect beverage it is absolutely nec- 
essary to immerse the coffee and simmer in order that 
the essential oil and flavor of the berry be extracted. 
Some particular persons heat the ground coffee slightly 
before adding the water. 

Coffee made in a metal vessel and permitted to stand 
forms tannate of iron, or ink, so to speak. 

CAFE NOIR 
(After Dinner Coffee) 

After dinner coffee is stronger and richer than that 
made for the breakfast table, and is served clear, al- 
though cream may be passed with the sugar. 

When Cognac or Petit Brule is served with the after 
dinner coffee, cream is entirely out of place. 

When Cognac is served with the black coffee, the 
loaf or domino sugar is placed in the spoon over the cup 
of coffee, and the Cognac is poured over the sugar and 
a lighted match touched to it. When burned away, the 
spoon and contents are dipped into the cup. This car- 
amelizes the sugar and when added to the coffee imparts 
to it a special flavor that is very appropriate after a 
heavy dinner. 

CREOLE COFFEE 

A popular method of serving coffee has come to us 
from the South. 

A very rich black coffee is prepared. 

The tray is brought to the table holding the coffee 
urn with another urn of boiling milk. With these are 
the cut loaf or domino sugar and a pitcher of cream. 

45 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

The boiling milk is first poured into the cup and 
then the steaming black coffee. The proportion is 
usually one part boiling milk to two parts coffee, or 
about half as much milk as coffee. Then the cream is 
added last. Sugar also is taken if desired. 

This gives a delicious coffee almost the consistency 
of cream. 

PETIT BRULE 

Select tough skinned oranges. Cut them in halves 
crosswise. Loosen the pulp from the skin without 
breaking the skin, turning the skin inside out. 

The top may be notched in small Van-dyke points, 
but it is not necessary. 

The orange shell thus formed is placed inside out on 
a small plate. A small stick of cinnamon and two or 
three cloves are placed in it with two lumps of sugar 
and placed before each diner when the black coffee is 
brought to the table. 

Cognac is passed and enough to saturate, but not 
drown the sugar, is poured over the sugar. A lighted 
match is then touched to the sugar. 

When all the alcohol is burned away from the 
brandy, the contents of the orange cup are turned into 
the black coffee. 

The little ceremony of preparing the Petit Brule is 
a charming finish to a social dinner. 

TEA 

Scald the pot. Remove the water, and put in a level 
teaspoon of good tea to each cup of water. Take the 
water at its first boil. Cover the pot with a cozy and 
stand it away from the fire for five minutes. Stir the 
tea and pour at once. 

The ordinary English tea cozy, a sort of padded cap, 
is to be recommended. 

46 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

CAUTION: — Tea must not be made over the fire, 
nor should it be made in a metal pot. The tannic acid 
acts on the metal, destroys the flavor of the tea and 
makes the infusion unwholesome. 

LEMON WITH BLACK TEA serves a certain 
dietetic purpose. "This is not a mere fad or 'foreign 
fashion,' there is a scientific reason beneath the surface. 
The citric acid of the fruit offsets the tannic acid of the 
tea, rendering it refreshing and wholesome. It is need- 
less to add that black tea be used, not the green or 
mixed." — R. M. Fletcher Berry. 

CHOCOLATE 

"To make one quart of chocolate, put into a saucepan 
four rounding teaspoons of grated chocolate. Add a 
half pint of boiling water, stirring all the while, until 
the mixture reaches boiling point. Boil just a moment. 

Add one and one-half pints of milk, and three round- 
ing tablespoons of sugar, and stir constantly until the 
milk is very hot. Take from the fire, turn into a heated 
chocolate pot and serve with whipped cream. 

In the absence of whipped cream, which is not al- 
ways available, a marshmallow is placed in each cup 
and the chocolate poured around it. 

Plain cream is passed in a pitcher. 

The chocolate is very often made with water omit- 
ting the milk entirely." — R. M. Fletcher Berry. 

COCOA— No. 1 

Cocoa and chocolate contain starch. Both should 
be boiled. 

Allow two round teaspoons of cocoa to each pint 
of liquid. To make one quart put four round teaspoons 
of cocoa in a double boiler, and add one pint of hot water. 
Stir until the cocoa is melted and hot. Then add one 

47 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

pint of boiling water. Beat and stir rapidly until the 
water in the under boiler again reaches the boiling 
point. 

Turn into a chocolate pot and serve with whipped 
cream. 

In the absence of whipped cream, which is not 
always available, place a marshmallow in each cup. 
Pour the chocolate around it. Pass plain cream in a 
pitcher. 

COCOA— No. 2 

To make one quart of cocoa put into a saucepan four 
rounding teaspoons of cocoa. Add a half pint of boil- 
ing water, stirring all the while, until the mixture 
reaches boiling point. Boil just a moment. 

Add one and one-half pints of milk, and three round- 
ing tablespoons of sugar, and stir constantly until the 
milk is very hot. Take from the fire, turn into a heated 
chocolate pot and serve with whipped cream, or pour 
over a marshmallow in each cup. 

Both chocolate and cocoa may be flavored with 
vanilla if desired. 

BEEF TEA (To Serve) 

Beef tea or beef extract, when ready to serve, may 
be served warm or iced and may have the addition of 
port wine or diluted with cream or hot water and sea- 
soned to suit the taste. 

Properly prepared it must not reach over 110 de- 
grees Fahr. or the juice, being like the white of an egg, 
will coagulate and harden or curdle. This is undesir- 
able as it is harder to digest although losing none of its 
nutriment. 

Select the round of beef as the meat from the round 
contains more nutritive juices. 

48 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

BEEF TEA— No. 1 
MATERIALS : 

1 pound round steak Salt to taste 

PREPARATION : 

Trim off all the fat, cut into small pieces, place in 
fruit jar and place in kettle of cold water. 

Bring to very near the boiling point and hold at that 
heat for three or four hours. 
Strain and salt to taste. 

BEEF TEA— No. 2 

Lean of round of beef cut into small pieces or put 
through the food chopper. Barely cover with cold 
water and allow to stand one-half hour. 

Place on the back of range or in warm place where 
the juice will be slowly drawn out. Put into a ricer 
and squeeze thoroughly. Place the juice in a cup in 
warm water until it loses its bright red color. 

Keep the water below boiling point. 

BEEF TEA— No. 3 

Place one round of thick round steak on the broiler 
for ten minutes, turning every ten seconds to prevent 
the juice escaping. Remove to a warm platter and cut 
into small pieces. 

Put into fruit press or ricer and extract all of the 
juice. Then put the juice or extract into a cup and this 
cup into a dish of warm water until it is the right 
color. Season to taste. 

BEEF TEA FRAPPE 

Ordinary beef tea becomes so monotonous to the 
invalid through the hot summer days, when even the 
appetites of the well are jaded, this f rappe will be found 
very grateful. 

To one cup of beef tea add the stiffly beaten white 
of one eggy put into freezer until it becomes the con- 

49 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

sistency of wet snow. This should be made in the glass 
freezer if possible. 

LEMONS IN DRINKS 

"When one is forty miles from a lemon, one may still 
have 'lemonade' by using citric acid in crystals or pul- 
verized, with or without a pure lemon tincture as flavor- 
ing. No ill effects can accrue from using this acid in 
such trifling quantity as required to make tart a drink 
or pudding sauce. It cannot completely take the place 
of the fruit juice, but as it is the acid found in, and 
taken from the fruits of the citrus family, it can be sub- 
stituted, therefore, if necessary, in moderation without 
harm." — R. M. Fletcher Berry. 

NECTAR 

To one pint of unfermented grape juice add the juice 
of two lemons and two oranges, one cup of sugar and 
one quart of water. When mixed add a sprig or two 
of mint. 

EGG PUNCH 
(Invalid Punch) 

Into an iced glass put one-quarter cup of grape 
juice with an equal quantity of shaved ice. To this add 
the beaten white of an egg and whip in. Sprinkle with 
powdered sugar. 

EGG LEMONADE WITH SHERRY 

MATERIALS: 

4 lemons 2 eggs 

2 cups sugar Pinch salt 

1 cup sherry 

PREPARATION : 

Slice the lemons very thin into a pitcher with the 
sugar. Pour over three pints of boiling water. Stand 
one hour. Strain and add the sherry. Whip up the 

50 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

eggs, separating whites from the yolks, adding the 
pinch of salt. Whip altogether into the other mixture. 
Place in refrigerator until chilled. 

CIDER EGG NOG 

To one egg whipped, then slightly sweetened with 
sugar, allow one glass of cider. Sprinkle with grated 
nutmeg and serve with shaved ice. Or serve hot. 

APPLE WATER 

"A cooling drink in fevers" 

Pare and core three large juicy pippins and slice 
them into a pitcher or crock with the grated rind of 
lemon. On this pour one pint of boiling water, then 
cover close and let stand for hours. Strain and sweeten 
with loaf sugar. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR ICED FRUIT 
BEVERAGES 

For the making of punches, lemonades, cold or 
frapped sweetened beverages, it is much more satis- 
factory to boil the sugar either with the fruit juice or 
with water to form a syrup. Less sugar is required 
and a better flavor is secured. 

For picnics or traveling make a syrup of the juice 
of lemons and sugar. This can be carried in a bottle 
and is always ready for instant use. 

FRUIT MINT JULEP— No. 1 

Boil together for ten minutes three pints of water 
and one pound and a half of granulated sugar. Add to 
this one packed cup of chopped mint leaves. Cover and 
let stand for ten minutes, then strain and cool. Add to 
this the strained juice of one dozen lemons, one cup and 

51 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

a half of strained orange and strawberry juice and let 
all stand an hour. Pour into a punch bowl containing 
a large piece of ice, add a bottle of Apollinaris and gar- 
nish with cherries and sprigs of mint. 

MINT JULEP— No. 2 

To the juice of three oranges add twelve sprigs of 
mint which have been chopped and bruised to a pulp, 
add powdered sugar or syrup of granulated sugar suffi- 
cient to sweeten. Allow to stand for a few minutes, 
then strain. 

Throw in some twisted chips of lemon and orange 
peel and add three cups of plain or effervescent water. 

If this is to be served in glasses with chipped ice, use 
less water and place a twisted chip of lemon and orange 
peel in each glass instead of in the pitcher. 

ORANGE PUNCH 
MATERIALS : 

4 oranges 1 pound sugar 

1 lemon Apollinaris 

PREPARATION : 

Grate the yellow rind from two oranges, add the 
gratings to the sugar, and a pint of water. Stir until 
the sugar is dissolved. Boil five minutes after it 
reaches the boiling point. Take from the fire, and when 
cold add the juice of the lemon and oranges. When 
ready to serve turn into a punch bowl, add cracked ice 
and sufficient Apollinaris or clear water to make pala- 
table, about one quart. 

DANDELION CORDIAL 

MATERIALS: 

4 quarts dandelion bios- 4 pounds white sugar 

soms without the 3 oranges 

stems 2 lemons 

4 quarts boiling water 1 cake compressed yeast 

52 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Scald the blossoms with the boiling water; allow 
to stand three days, squeeze and strain. 

Slice the oranges and lemons very thin, put all of 
the materials together in a stone jar, dissolving the 
yeast in a little water. Allow to stand three days. 
Strain and put into bottles or jugs to ferment. 

Leave them uncorked and keep them full to the top 
so that the froth may be thrown off. To keep the bot- 
tles or jugs full add cold water from day to day. In 
about six weeks the cordial is ready to bottle. Drop 
two or three raisins in each bottle. Cork tightly. 

DOMESTIC KIRSCHWASSER 

Pour a gallon of brandy over a pound of garden or 
wild ripe cherries or plums, crushing well both fruit 
and kernels. Add two pounds of sugar and let stand 
five weeks, when strain and bottle. 

PERRY 

Perry bears the same relation to pears that cider 
does to apples, being the expressed juice of the fruit. 
Perry may be made from the ordinary pear, the better 
one of the windfalls or unsalable "nubbins," but there 
are certain varieties known in general as "perry" pears, 
grown especially for this purpose. These varieties lack 
in fragrance and edible qualities, being vigorously 
harsh, but they are much prized in Germany, France, 
and England, where numerous perry orchards are set 
out. The fermented perry is considerably superior to 
cider in richness and sweetness. It contains seven per 
cent of alcohol (Enc. Brit.) and will keep in casks for 
three years — when bottled, longer, but it does not bear 
shipment as well as might be desired.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

RED CURRANT WINE 

To a quart each of currant juice and sugar allow two 
quarts of water. Pour into stone jugs and allow to fer- 
ment, keeping the jug full so that the froth will con- 
tinually bubble over until fermentation has ceased. 

Strain and bottle. 

GOOSEBERRY WINE 

Use fully grown but not thoroughly ripened ber- 
ries, removing blossoms and stems and bruising fruit 
without crushing seeds or skins. To twenty pounds 
of berries add two gallons rain water, stirring and 
mashing fruit until it is cleared from the skin. Let 
stand six hours then strain free of seeds and skins and 
bring resulting juice to a boil. Have dissolved fifteen 
pounds sugar and add this to juice as it heats. Mean- 
time let seeds and skins be soaking in a gallon of water. 
When the sugar and first liquor are at boiling point add 
this second quantity, strained. Measure it all and add 
sufficient water to bring whole quantity up to five gal- 
lons. Let this ferment in cask, covering bunghole with 
cheese cloth and allowing room for fermentation. 
When this has ceased, stop the bung and let wine stand 
six or seven months before using. 

RASPBERRY CORDIAL 

Fill stone jar with ripe berries; cover close and let 
stand where it will heat gently till fruit breaks itself. 
Squeeze juice through linen bag and to each quart allow 
one pound of sugar. Let all come to a boil and skim 
well till scum ceases to rise, when remove from stove 
and put again through linen bag, pouring into a crock 
with brandy in equal proportion to juice. Stir, and 
when cold place in demijohn and cork for two weeks, 
when, if not clear, filter, then bottle and seal. 

54 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE— No. 1 

Heat the thoroughly ripe grapes slowly — in a double 
boiler or crock — on the back of the stove or in a slow 
oven. When the skins are tender strain through cheese 
cloth bag without squeezing. When juice has been re- 
placed on stove and is at boiling point, add half as much 
sugar as juice. Let dissolve perfectly then seal while 
hot. 

UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE— No. 2 

Wash, crush, and heat the fruit, simmering for thirty 
minutes. Crush again, strain, and squeeze hard through 
a bag. Replace juice on stove, boil and skim, then 
add one-fourth pint of sugar to each pint of juice, 
and boil about six minutes. Fill heated bottles and 
seal at once. 

UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE— No. 3 

(Without Sugar) 

Mash, heat, and press grapes. Have bottles ready 
on a false wooden bottom in a large boiler. Fill bot- 
tles with the cooled juice, pour cold water in the boiler 
up to the necks of the bottles, let the whole heat, and 
boil for ten minutes. As the juice may evaporate the 
bottles should be filled up from one special bottle. 
Cork and seal while hot. 

UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE— No. 4 

(Without Sugar) 

A second method of preserving the juice without 
sugar is to mash the fresh grapes before heating them. 
Strain off the juice, then heat to boiling point as above. 

55 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

RASPBERRY ROYAL 

Use four quarts of best berries. Pour over them one 
quart cider vinegar and add one pound sugar, mashing 
all to a paste. Let stand in sun four hours, when strain 
off juice and add one pint brandy. Bottle and seal. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL— No. 1 

Crush and strain berries, allowing for each quart 
one-half pound sugar, a teaspoon each of cloves and 
cinnamon (powdered) and a grated nutmeg. Boil all 
together fifteen minutes; cool, and for each quart of 
syrup add one-half pint brandy. Bottle. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL— No. 2 

To three pounds uncooked berries allow one pound 
white sugar and let stand twelve hours. Then press 
and strain, adding one-third rum or brandy and allow- 
ing one teaspoon allspice (powdered) to each quart of 
cordial. It must be bottled some time before it is fit 
for use. 

ORIENTAL PUNCH 
MATERIALS : 

1 ounce Ceylon or India 1 teaspoon of rose water 

tea 1 teaspoon vanilla 

2 pounds sugar 3 ripe bananas 

6 lemons 1 pint grape juice 

2 oranges 3 quarts Apollinaris 

1 pint grated pineapple 

1 teaspoon bitter almond 
extract 
PREPARATION : 

Put the tea into a pitcher, cover with a quart of boil- 
ing water, cover the pitcher for twenty minutes, then 
strain. Grate the yellow rind from half the lemons and 
oranges, add the gratings to the sugar. Put the sugar 
in a saucepan, add the tea infusion, stir until the sugar 
is dissolved, bring to boiling point. 

56 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Strain into a stone or glass jar and stand aside over 
night. Next morning add the juice of the lemons and 
oranges, and all the other materials, with the exception 
of the Apollinaris. 

When ready to serve, turn this into a punch bowl 
over a good sized block of ice, add the Apollinaris water 
and serve. 

This may be varied by adding a bottle of ginger ale 
instead of the grape juice. 

CURRANT SHRUB 

Strain currant juice and allow a pound of sugar for 
each pint of juice. Boil five minutes, then stir cool. 
Bottle in sterilized bottles and seal, or cork. Old- 
fashioned proportion is one tablespoon to each glass of 
water. Another shrub calls for a wineglass of brandy 
to each pint of syrup. 

GINGER SHRUB 

This is an old-time hot weather drink which has 
undergone as many changes as the seasons. 

Tie a heaping tablespoon of Jamaica ground ginger 
in a piece of cheese cloth. Put this into a quart of cold 
water and bring to the boiling point. Add a cup of 
sugar and stir until dissolved. Add the juice of two 
lemons and place where it will chill. When ready to 
serve, fill punch glasses, in which have been placed a 
small chunk of ice, a bruised sprig of mint, a stoned 
cherry and the thin twisted chip of the yellow rind of 
lemons. 

BAKED LEMON FOR COLDS 
Bake a lemon whole till thoroughly tender and eat 
it hot with sugar just before retiring. It is best to do 
without the evening meal and to fast otherwise as far 
as possible. Also drink much water. This should be 
taken three nights in succession. 

67 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

RHUBARB WINE 

The rhubarb wine is one of the nicest of home-made 
wines and the material for it is not expensive. 

Break up and run through food chopper eighteen 
pounds of rhubarb and place it in a large stone jar with 
three gallons of water. Cover it and let it stand in a 
cool place for one week, stirring once a day. 

Strain it over twelve pounds of granulated sugar, 
put into open jugs or large bottles keeping full to over- 
flowing, until fermentation ceases. Then strain, place 
in keg and bung tightly. Keep in keg for about nine 
months, then bottle. 

TEA PUNCH 

Iced tea beverages never lose their favor and, if 
anything, are growing in popularity. The tea punch is 
easily prepared and does not require freezing. 

One way of preparing is to place one heaping table- 
spoon of a mixed tea, usually a combination of Oolong 
and Gunpowder, in a heated tea urn or pitcher. Pour 
over it one pint of boiling water. Let remain about five 
minutes, then strain and add sugar to sweeten while it 
is still hot. Then add the juice of one or two lemons. 
Chill and add a pint of plain or carbonated water. 

Place shaved ice in each glass and pour over it the 
chilled beverage. A sprig of mint or a section of lemon 
may be served. 

FLAXSEED LEMONADE 

Another old-fashioned and generally effective 
remedy for colds is this laxative drink : Pour a quart of 
boiling water over a cup of flaxseed. Add juice of two 
lemons and sugar to taste. Let steep in covered jug 
several hours and drink hot just before retiring. (This 
may be thinned if preferred). 

58

LEMON FOR HEADACHE 

The juice of a large lemon squeezed into a small cup 
of strong, black coffee (no sugar) will often prevent or 
cure a headache.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 



VEGETABLES 

SPANISH RICE— No. 1 

Put one-half cup of rice in a frying pan with two 
tablespoons of butter or cooking oil, and one small 
onion sliced thin. Let cook a short time, then add one- 
half can of tomatoes and one-half cup of grated cheese, 
season with salt and cayenne pepper. Cook slowly until 
done, adding hot water or soup stock if too dry. 

SPANISH RICE— No. 2 

Fry for a few seconds in two tablespoons of oil one- 
half cup of uncooked rice, add a small chopped onion 
and a clove of garlic, one cup of chopped cold veal, 
chicken or ham. Season with salt and pepper and a tea- 
spoon of sugar. Cover with boiling water and cook 
slowly, without stirring. When rice is nearly done, re- 
move cover. 

SPANISH RICE— No. 3 

Wash, drain and dry one-half cup of rice. Put two 
tablespoons of oil or butter into a saucepan and add 
the rice. Cook till browned. Then put into a double 
cooker, add one cup of water and cook till the water is 
absorbed. Then add one and one-half cups of hot stewed 
tomatoes and cook till rice is tender. Season well with 
salt and paprika. 

RICE CURRY 

Hard boil and chill six eggs. Cook in rapidly boiling, 
salted water one-half cup of rice to one quart of water. 
When cooked tender drain from a colander and allow 
boiling water to run through it for a moment. 

Place in a warm oven to dry slightly. While the 
rice is cooking put two tablespoons of oil or butter into 

61 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

a saucepan with a medium minced onion and when 
browned add a teaspoon of curry powder. Then two 
level tablespoons of flour. Pour over enough of the 
water in which the rice was cooked to make a creamy 
sauce. Add more seasoning if necessary. Place the 
rice in a mound in a deep hot platter and arrange the 
hard boiled eggs in quarters, cut lengthways, around 
the rice. Pour over all the curry and sprinkle with 
minced parsley. 

RICE CROQUETTES 
MATERIALS : 

2 cups cold boiled rice 1 heaping tablespoon flour 

Salt to season Bread crumbs 

Cracker meal Dried crushed parsley for 

Oil or drippings for frying garnish 

2 eggs 
PREPARATION : 

Beat the white of one egg until foamy and mix it 
with the rice, season with the salt if desired and add 
enough bread crumbs to bind the rice. 

Mix the flour with the cracker meal and if the cro- 
quettes are not to be served as a sweet, add a dash of 
pepper and salt to the cracker meal. 

Beat the yolks of the two eggs and remaining white 
till broken. Take the rice mixture by tablespoons, roll 
in the cracker meal to shape them and then in the beaten 
egg, then back again in the cracker meal. If frying 
them on a pancake griddle, flatten them but if in deep 
oil or fat, shape them round like a sausage. A fry 
basket is a very necessary adjunct to the fry kettle. 

When cooked a delicate brown, drop on paper to 
absorb any excess of oil. Sprinkle with parsley. 

RICE LOAF WITH SAUCE CREOLE 
Put alternate layers of cold cooked rice, minced 
ham and bread crumbs in a ramekin or baking dish. 
Beat one egg slightly and stir into it enough milk to 

62 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

moisten the contents of the dish. Set it in a dish of 
shallow water and bake about one-half hour in a hot 
oven. 

Put two tablespoons of drippings or oil into a sauce- 
pan. Put into it a large onion and two green peppers 
sliced. Saute and add two cups of tomatoes and cook 
till reduced. Season highly with paprika. If the bak- 
ing dish can be brought to the table pour the sauce over 
the rice, but if not, turn it out onto a deep platter and 
surround with the sauce Creole. 

DEVILED POTATOES 
MATERIALS : 

2 dozen small new potatoes 54 teaspoon pepper 

1 teaspoon mustard 1 teaspoon salt 

2 heaping tablespoons but- 2 tablespoons vinegar 

ter 2 egg yolks 

1 cup drippings or oil 

PREPARATION : 

Boil the potatoes until nearly done. Peel. Heat the 
drippings in a frying pan and fry the potatoes until they 
are a nice golden brown color. Melt the butter in a 
saucepan and add the pepper, salt, mustard and vinegar. 
Now place the potatoes in the saucepan and let them 
simmer three minutes. Remove to a hot dish. Add the 
eggs to the sauce. Pour it over the potatoes and serve. 

RICED POTATOES 

Boil the potatoes as for mashed potatoes. Ten min- 
utes before taking from the fire add sufficient salt to 
the water. 

When cooked, drain, put into a heated ricer and 
press directly into a hot tureen. Sprinkle with pepper 
and minced parsley. Dot with butter. Keep hot until 
time to serve. 

Riced potatoes are nice served in hot ramekins. 

63 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

MASHED POTATOES 

Put medium sized potatoes over to boil in hot water. 
When cooked drain thoroughly. Add salt and butter 
to season, mash and add as much hot milk, a little at 
a time, as the potatoes will take up. 

Dish into a hot tureen, sprinkle with pepper and 
dot with butter. Cover and send to the table. 

SAVORY POTATOES 

To one pint of mashed potatoes add one-half cup of 
sweet milk and salt to season. Mix in three level table- 
spoons of grated cheese, place in buttered baking dish. 
Sprinkle with grated cheese, dot with butter and bake 
brown. 

STUFFED POTATOES 

Select medium potatoes. Let stand in warm water 
a few moments and then scrub well with a vegetable 
brush and bake. 

When baked cut a slice from the top of each, scoop 
out the inside, mash, adding butter, pepper, salt to sea- 
son, and as much hot milk as they will stand. 

To six potatoes add the stiffly beaten whites of two 
eggs. Refill the shells with the potatoes, dot with but- 
ter and return to the oven ten minutes. 

CARAMELIZED SWEET POTATOES

sprinkle with a very little salt and generous sprinkle 
of cinnamon. Place in hot oven twenty minutes. 

Maple or Karo syrup may take the place of sugar 
and water. 

ASPARAGUS PIQUANTE 

After trimming the asparagus of the coarse ends, cut 
the stalks in two and tie together in bunches easy to 
handle. Cook until tender in salted water. Drain and 
remove to a very hot dish. 

Have prepared some time before a dressing made in 
the following way. Into a French dressing bottle put 
one level teaspoon each of salt and sugar, a generous 
portion of chili powder, one-quarter of level teaspoon 
of pepper, the yolk of one egg, four tablespoons of olive 
oil and two tablespoons of vinegar. Shake well for 
three minutes, and pour over the hot asparagus. To be 
just right the asparagus must be piping hot. 

Served as a luncheon or supper dish, with cold 
boiled tongue and thin slices of buttered bread, it makes 
a dainty and tempting combination. 

ASPARAGUS IN A BREAD BOAT 

MATERIALS : 

1 pint of milk Yolks of 4 eggs 

1 tablespoon butter Salt and pepper to season 

1 stale Vienna loaf 

PREPARATION: 

Cleanse the asparagus carefully and cut into inch 
pieces, using only the tender portion of the stalks. Re- 
serve the butts and the water in which the tips are 
cooked for soup, or, if preferred, cook the stalks whole 
tied in bundles and, after cooking tender (one-half 
hour) in salted water, drain and cut off the tender part 

65 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

of the stalks into inch pieces, rubbing the coarser ends 
through a colander into the water and setting it away 
for future use, to be made into a cream of asparagus. 

Hollow out the center of the loaf to form a boat suffi- 
ciently large to hold the asparagus. Brush it over with 
butter and brown quickly in a hot oven. 

Put the milk into a double boiler, beat the yolks of 
the eggs, add to them slowly the hot milk, return to the 
boiler and cook till creamy. Take from the fire, season 
with salt and pepper and add the butter. Put the 
asparagus into the bread boat and pour over it the 
sauce. Arrange on a long narrow platter and send to 
the table hot. To serve, cut through the boat, helping 
a slice with the asparagus. 

ASPARAGUS A LA HOLLANDAISE 

Cleanse thoroughly the asparagus, tie into bundles, 
boil in salted water and drain, put on a platter and set 
aside to cool. Serve very cold with a hot sauce 
Hollandaise. To eat, lift each piece by the butt with 
the fingers, dip in the sauce and lift to the mouth. Eat 
only the tender portion. 

SAUCE HOLLANDAISE 
MATERIALS : 

2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon chopped onion 

1 tablespoon flour ^ pint boiling water 

2 tablespoons tarragon Yolks of 2 eggs 

vinegar Salt and pepper to season 

PREPARATION: 

Put the onion and vinegar over the fire and bring to 
the boiling point and cool. Rub the flour and butter 
together, add gradually the boiling water, strain the 
vinegar and add. Take from the fire and stir in gradu- 
ally the yolks of the eggs. Heat very gently for a mo- 
ment, add seasoning of salt and pepper and strain into 
a sauce boat.

BAKED BEANS IN TOMATO SAUCE 

Soak over night in cold water one pint of beans with 
a pinch of soda. In the morning drain, rinse and put 
into the kettle with half a pound of bacon. Cook for 
about one hour or until the skin of the bean is ready to 
break, which test can be made by taking up two or 
three and pressing off the skin with the fork, or blow- 
ing upon them when, if they are sufficiently cooked, the 
skin will crack and curl back. They must not be soft. 

If you have not the regulation bean pot or casserole, 
a common butter jar or milk crock will answer the pur- 
pose fully as well. By the time the beans are ready to 
remove from the kettle, the water should be just suffi- 
cient to cover them. Remove from the kettle with a 
skimmer ladle and put into the bean pot or jar. Score 
the rind of the pork and bury in the beans until only 
the rind is visible. 

While the beans are cooking put over the fire the 
contents of one can of tomatoes, or its equivalent in 
fresh ones, with a minced onion, one bay leaf and a sea- 
soning of chili powder. Cook twenty minutes and 
strain through a coarse sieve. Add one level tablespoon 
of sugar if desired. Put this with the liquor from which 
the beans were taken, season with salt if necessary and 
pour over the beans in the jar. Sprinkle with a dash of 
pepper and bake slowly from four to six hours. 

If you use gas or gasoline for cooking take a tip 
from my kitchen economy. In the absence of a srnall 
oven, place a brick over the low flame of the gasoline 
stove or the simmering burner of the gas range. On 
this place an asbestos mat and the jar of beans. Over 
this turn a large gallon jar or iron kettle. This arrange- 
ment makes an ideal baker at small expense. Do not 
attempt to finish the baked beans in a fireless food 
cooker without the supplementary heated arrangement 

67 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

of bricks or other heat retainers. If you have a good 
quality of tomato or cocktail sauce a little of this may 
be put into the beans before baking instead of making 
a special sauce. 

CARAMELIZED CARROTS 

Scrape carrots cut in sections about two inches long, 
then into strips about as thick as a lead pencil. Boil 
until tender. Drain and place in a shallow saucepan, 
cover with one cup of vinegar, three-quarters cup of 
brown sugar, dash of salt, one tablespoon of butter, 
simmer to a syrup. Serve hot. 

CARROTS PIQUANTE 
MATERIALS: 

1 pint carrots Yz cup vinegar 

1 quart water 54 ^^P sugar 

1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon butter 

PREPARATION : 

Scrape the carrots and cut them in sections one and 
one-half inches long. Then slice them lengthwise one- 
fourth or an inch thick and then in strips of the same 
thickness. Add the water and salt and boil until tender. 
Drain off the water, add the vinegar, sugar and butter 
and cook until the carrots have a clear appearance. 
Serve. 

MACARONI WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

To prepare macaroni, spaghetti or vermicelli for any 
dish it is necessary to first drop it into salted boiling 
water and cook at a rapid boiling point from twenty- 
five to thirty minutes. Then turn into colander or 
sieve and pour cold water through it. This blanches 
it.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

BAKED TOMATO HASH 

Put one-half green pepper and one small onion 
through the food chopper. Then put the cold meat 
through it. Have ready some grated bread. Mix the 
meat, onion and pepper, salt and season to taste. Put 
a layer of the meat mixture, then a layer of canned 
tomatoes or fresh ones sliced in buttered baking dish. 
Then follow with a generous sprinkle of bread crumbs. 
Season and add the balance of the meat mixture and 
some more tomatoes, bread crumbs and seasoning. 
Have two layers of each and about two cups of lightly 
packed meat and one cup of tomatoes. Dot the top 
with pieces of butter or a generous sprinkle of cheese. 
Bake about one-half hour. 

TOMATO FRITTERS 

Season one pint of stewed and strained tomatoes 
with half a teaspoon of sugar and salt and pepper to 
taste. Bring to the boiling point, add one tablespoon 
of butter creamed with equal quantity of flour. Stir 
until thickened. Remove the crusts and cut in two, 
slices of stale bread. Let them soak for a moment in 
the mixture covering both sides. Fry in deep fat or 
oil. Drain on paper and serve hot with a sprinkle of 
powdered sugar. 

TOMATO SAUCE 

Simmer twenty minutes one can of tomatoes with 
one bay leaf, half a dozen cloves and allspice, a clove of 
garlic, a small onion, sliced, and a green pepper. 

Strain through a coarse sieve. Put two tablespoons 
of oil, butter or butterine into a saucepan, stir in two 
level tablespoons of flour, then add the strained toma- 
toes. Cook three minutes and add the parboiled maca- 
roni and cook a few minutes more. Season to taste with 
salt and paprika.

Treat the same as the green tomatoes, taking care 
to select medium-sized tomatoes that are firm and solid. 

VEGETARIAN CUTLETS 

Mash three large hot boiled potatoes, adding butter 
seasoning and enough hot milk to slightly moisten. 
Chop fine one onion and fry golden brown in a table- 
spoon of cottolene or oil. Boil and chop fine one cupful 
each of carrots and turnips. Combine all of the mate- 
rials and season highly. Mold into cutlets. Dip each 
in slightly beaten egg, roll in powdered bread crumbs 
and fry a rich brown in deep oil.

DESSERTS 

RHUBARB FANCIES 
MATERIALS : 

1 pound rhubarb 1 cup whipped and sweetened 

1 cup sugar cream 

Yz cup boiling water Whites of 2 eggs 

1 tablespoon granulated Juice of 1 orange 
gelatine Orange straws 

Rich pastry 
PREPARATION : 

Cut the rhubarb into short lengths with shears and 
put over the fire to cook soft with one cup of sugar and 
one-half cup of boiling water. Add the orange juice 
just long enough before removing from the fire to heat 
it. Add the tablespoon of gelatine dissolved in cold 
water. Whip the whites of the eggs very stiff and with 
the rotary beater whip them into the rhubarb. Chill 
and heap into the patty shells. 

To make the patty shells, use the small fluted patty 
tins and turning them bottom side up, cover with a rich 
pastry which has been chilled, rolled out an inch thick, 
buttered, folded again and rolled to the thickness of a 
pie crust. Prick these well before putting in the oven 
and look at them when half baked to prick and release 
any air that may spoil their shape. When baked and 
cooled fill with the rhubarb. Heap the whipped cream 
over each and stick two or three orange straws or strips 
of angelica in each. 

GOOSEBERRY FOOL 

(An English Dish) 
Gooseberry Fool is made by stewing a pint of goose- 
berries until soft, then putting them through a sieve 
and sweetening the pulp. Make cup of custard, and 
when it is cold whip the gooseberries into it, beat the 
whites of two eggs very stiff, beat them into the mix- 
ture and serve cold. 

71 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

GELATINE SURPRISE 

When ice cream or sherbets are among the left- 
overs and it is not convenient to again freeze them do 
not think they are wasted. 

To one cup of melted ice cream add a heaping tea- 
spoon of gelatine which has been dissolved in one-half 
cup boiling water. As it chills and begins to thicken, 
stir in a few chopped nuts or grated macaroons. Mold 
in cups. 

To serve, turn into glass dishes, cover with shreds 
of Maraschino cherries. Serve with cream. 

MACAROON PUDDING 
MATERIALS : 

16 macaroons 4 level tablespoons flour 

3 eggs 1 level tablespoon corn starch 

Some sherry 1 cup milk 

5 level tablespoons 1 cup sugar 

crushed almonds 1 cup cream 

PREPARATION: 

Soak twelve macaroons in some sherry. Roll four 
to a powder. Beat yolks of eggs and add sugar, milk, 
cream, almonds, starch, flour and powdered macaroons. 
Lastly the well beaten egg whites. 

Put the mixture into a pudding dish, place the wine- 
soaked macaroons on the top. Set the pudding dish in 
a shallow dish of water in a moderate oven. 

PRUNE JELLY 

Remove the stones from two cups of stewed prunes 
and their juice. Heat to boiling, add sufficient sugar to 
make quite sweet. Add one heaping tablespoon of plain 
minute gelatine. Stir until dissolved and pour into 
molds to chill. 

Use either the individual molds and surround with 
whipped cream to serve, or mold in hollow round mold 
and turn into large glass dish, filling the center with 
whipped cream. 

72 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PRUNE WHIP 
MATERIALS : 

Yz pound prunes 1 tablespoon lemon juice 

Yz cup sugar 2 egg whites 

PREPARATION : 

Soak prunes over night. Scrub with a vegetable 
brush. Put on to cook in water to cover, and simmer 
slowly until well cooked. Work through a puree sieve. 
Beat the ^%z whites and the lemon juice, sugar and 
prunes, and whip until very stiff. Serve with a custard 
or whipped cream. 

Other stewed dried fruits may be served in the 
same way. 

PRUNE SOUFFLE 

Soak prunes over night, after having cleansed them 
well in warm water and removing the imperfect fruit. 
Cook the fruit several hours over moderate heat. Take 
out enough of the broken fruit to fill one cup. Remove 
the stones and put through a colander. Add the well 
beaten yolks of three eggs and two tablespoons of 
sugar. Then fold in the stiffly beaten whites. Turn 
into a baking dish, dust the top with powdered sugar 
and bake in a quick oven about six to ten minutes. Any 
other fruit, particularly the stewed dried fruits may be 
substituted for the prunes. 

Serve with unsweetened plain or whipped cream. 

CHOCOLATE SAUCE 

Melt one-half square of chocolate, add a heaping 
tablespoon of sugar and three tablespoons of hot water 
and cook until smooth and glossy. 

Then add to it half a cup of scalded milk. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs. Add three level tablespoons of 

73 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

sugar and dilute with the hot mixture. Return to the 
saucepan and cook until the mixture coats the spoon. 
When cold, fold in half a cup of double cream, beaten 
solid with half a teaspoon of vanilla extract. 

LEMON SAUCE 

This sauce is the basis for many flavorings and 
changes, and is so quickly made that it is well to know 
how easily it may be done. Instead of creaming the 
flour and butter together for it, mix either a heaping 
tablespoon of cornstarch or a well rounding one of 
flour with a cup or granulated sugar. Put this into a 
saucepan with a tablespoon of butter and pour in two 
cups of boiling water. Allow this to boil up and your 
sauce is ready for any flavoring you prefer. A half 
of a lemon sliced is an ordinary way of preparing it. 

The stiffly beaten whites of two eggs well beaten in 
will change it to a foamy sauce. 

Using half the proportion of boiling water and re- 
placing it with sherry or grape juice or even a fruit 
juice, makes a desirable change. 

One delightful variation of this sauce is to cut up 
bananas very fine and add to it just before removing 
from the fire. 

HARD SAUCE 

Cream one-third cup of butter with one cup of sugar. 
When very white and curdled looking, add the stiffly 
beaten white of one egg and one tablespoon of lemon 
juice. Force through a rose tube into roses or twists, 
sprinkle with pistachio nuts, blanched and minced, or 
with shredded, candied or Maraschino cherries. 

Set away to chill.

One word of caution relative to putting a plate or 

78 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

tin in the kettle. If the kettle is granite do not place 
either in direct contact with the bottom, as the enamel 
is apt to break off from the kettle. Place a couple of 
skewers or anything that will leave a space between the 
dish and the bottom of the kettle. 

Serve with any rich pudding sauce.

ries. Steam three hours. Serve with a wine sauce. 

APPLES IN BLOOM 

MATERIALS: 

6 apples (very red) 1 lemon (juice and rind) 

Yz cup sugar 1 orange (juice) 

PREPARATION: 

Select red apples, Baldwin, Mcintosh Red or 
Spitzenbergen are best. Put them into boiling water, 
covering them about half way up, turning them often. 
When tender take from the water and remove the skin 
carefully that the apple may still retain all of the red 
coloring. Arrange on the serving dish. 

To the water in which they were cooked add the 

79 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

sugar and fruit juices, simmer until reduced to one cup. 
Pour over the apples. 

ST. PATRICK DESSERT 

Dissolve one package of lemon jello or jellicon in 
a scant pint of boiling water. Make stems about as 
large as small toothpicks of either citron or angelica, 
press them into the opening of green Maraschino cher- 
ries. Lay them in groups of three in the bottom of 
small saucepan or jelly mold and secure them in place 
with about half an inch depth of dissolved gelatine. 
Allow it to become firm before adding the balance. Set 
away to chill for two hours. 

Unmold when ready to serve and surround with 
whipped cream, slightly sweetened. Sprinkle blanched 
and chopped pistachio nuts over the whipped cream. 

APRICOT DESSERT— No. 1 

Take the juice from a can of apricots, add water to 
make one pint and put over to boil. When it has 
reached the boiling point add a package of lemon jelli- 
con or jello. Place a half of apricot in the cups of an 
egg poacher or in a teacup and pour around enough of 
the cooled jelly to just cover the apricot. Set away to 
harden. 

Prepare large rounds of any kind of cake, a yellow 
sponge preferred, and turn onto it the apricot in jelly. 
Surround with whipped cream. 

APRICOT DESSERT— No. 2 

To one cup of apricot juice, from a can of the fruit, 
add the beaten yolk of one egg and one-half cup of 

80 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

sugar and one-half cup of cookie or stale bread crumbs. 
Put over the fire in a double boiler. When cooked re- 
move from the fire and beat in the stiffly beaten white 
of the egg. 

Cut the apricots in small sections and add to the 
mixture. Set away in cups or ramekins to mold and 
chill and serve with whipped cream. 

APRICOT MERINGUE 

Half fill a buttered pudding mold with stewed dried 
apricots, first draining off the juice, add the juice to 
sufficient milk to make one pint. 

Dilute two level tablespoons of cornstarch with milk 
to pour and cook in the syrup and milk ten minutes. 
Beat the yolks of three eggs, add three tablespoons of 
sugar and stir into the hot custard, stir while the egg 
cooks a little. Then add a level tablespoon of butter 
and pour over the apricots. Beat the egg whites until 
dry, then beat in gradually three level tablespoons of 
sugar and the grated rind of either an orange or a 
lemon. 

Spread upon the pudding and place in the oven 
long enough to cook the meringue. 

ORANGE AND PINEAPPLE COMPOTE 

I find I can dispense very well with the use of the 
pineapple eyecutters. Slice the pineapple into inch or 
wider slices. Then it is a very easy matter with a sharp 
vegetable knife to remove the shell and eyes. Do not 
use the hard center core. 

If possible, use a long stemmed glass berry dish in 
which to make up the compote. 

81 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Prepare one-half of a pineapple, cutting into dice. 
Peel and remove all the white pith from two oranges. 
Score them both ways across and then slice off in thin 
slices. Put the fruits together and sweeten with suffi- 
cient sugar. 

Place two cups of milk in the double boiler. Mix 
well one rounding tablespoon of flour with one-half cup 
of sugar. Add this to the hot milk. Beat slightly the 
yolks of three eggs with three tablespoons of cold water 
and stir into the mixture. Cook till thick and creamy. 
Then arrange the fruit and the custard in layers in the 
glass dish, beginning with the fruit and having a layer 
of the custard last. 

Put the whites of eggs into a deep, narrow bowl and 
beat very stiff with a rotary egg beater, add three level 
tablespoons of powdered sugar. If convenient drop 
three or four crushed currants or strawberries in with 
the whites of the eggs. If not, add a few drops of lemon 
juice or pinch of cream of tartar to make the egg whites 
very stiff, and a grating of orange peel to give a delicate 
tinge of color. Drop this meringue in spoonfuls over 
the custard. 

This is a dessert that has no equal for daintiness 
and goodness. 

Other combinations of fruits may be used, but there 
is something particularly inviting in a combination of 
pineapple anid orange. 

PINEAPPLE WHIP 
MATERIALS: 

54 cup sugar 1 lemon, juice and grated rind 

1% cup water Plain gelatine to make 1 pint 

2 egg whites firm gelatine 

5^ cup preserved 

shredded pineapple 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Heat the pineapple, water and lemon juice together 
with the sugar. Dissolve the gelatine in a little cold 
water and then add it to the fruits. When cold whip 
until ready to harden. 

Add the stiffly beaten whites of the two eggs. Put 
into wet individual molds until ready to serve. 

Serve with custard sauce. 

EASTER TRIFLE 

Make a cream custard of the yolks of two eggs, one 
cup of milk, three tablespoons of sugar and two tea- 
spoons of flour. Put the milk into a double boiler, mix 
the flour and sugar and add to the milk. Beat the yolks 
of the eggs and add a very little cold milk, then add 
to the hot milk. Cook till creamy, then set aside until 
ready to serve. 

When preparing the meal beat up the white of one 
egg with one grated sour apple, one-half cup of pow- 
dered sugar and the juice of half a lemon. Almost 
every kitchen equipment contains a porcelain or stone- 
ware bowl about five and one-half inches across the 
top and three inches deep. Put all the ingredients for 
the meringue in such a bowl and beat with a rotary egg 
beater until very stiff — stiff enough so that the bowl can 
be inverted without spilling the contents. Put this 
meringue into a pastry bag or cone of paper and force 
into a mound around a small plate. Sprinkle with 
blanched and minced pistachio nuts. Fill the center 
with the cream custard. 

A flavoring of vanilla may be added to the custard 
after it is taken from the fire, although a great many 
particular people prefer a custard without flavoring of 
any kind. A cream custard will lose none of its deli- 
cacy by adding a very little flour, arrowroot or corn- 

83 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

starch and will have the desired body without danger 
of curdling. The cornstarch or flour may be well mixed 
with the sugar, but the arrowroot must be dissolved in 
a little cold water. Use any one of them very spar- 
ingly. 

PLUM TRIFLE 

Cooks plums slowly till soft when rub through sieve 
and let cool. To each cup of pulp add the whites of 
three eggs beaten stiff and a little sugar. Drop a 
spoonful of this on cups two-thirds full of a simple 
custard, letting the fruit meringue heap up well. Serve 
cold. 

APPLE AMBER 

Core, peel, and chop three-fourths pound of apples. 
Mix together four ounces of suet, two each of sugar and 
flour, a little nutmeg and grated lemon peel and two 
beaten eggs. Stir thoroughly and place in a well but- 
tered mold with cloth tied tight over top. Boil three 
hours. 

APPLE SNOW 

Apple Snow may be made in two ways, using either 
the cooked or uncooked apples. For the uncooked 
grate a medium sized tart apple (peeled, grated, and set 
aside). Whip stiff the white of one egg with a pinch 
of salt, then add, gradually, three tablespoons of sugar, 
beating well into the egg, alternating with the grated 
apple, a tablespoon at a time, till all the apple and 
sugar are used, then continue to whip until the "snow" 
has risen to at least a pint and a half in quantity, for it 
will swell surprisingly. If the cooked apple is used ob- 
serve the same proportion, the white of one egg to the 
pulp of one apple. Chopped dates or nuts may be added 
or fresh, grated cocoanut. The "snow" may be served 
as it is, or quickly and lightly browned.

LIGHT FRUIT DESSERTS 

The fresh fruits work up so well into delicious com- 
potes and fruit rolls that are so much more easily made 
than pies and so much more digestible, that in the sum- 
mer season pies can and should be almost entirely 
eliminated from the menu. 

Pie pastry at its very best is indigestible for the 
reason that the starch grains are coated with the fat 
or shortening and in the processes of digestion the 
starch is taken up in the digestive apparatus and acted 
upon before the fats, and the coating around these 
starch particles prevent this until after the food has 
passed this point. This forces the starch into the intes- 
tines in an undigested state. 

Then, too, at that season of the year fatty foods are 
not desirable or necessary, and pie pastry properly 
made is just exactly one-third fatty substance. 

Pies, therefore, should be discarded with the heavier 
meats until cold and strenuous weather makes demands 
upon the system that only these richer foods can sup- 
ply. 

A STRAWBERRY ROUND-A-LAY 

Someone has said "that possibly God could have 
made something better than the strawberry, but doubt- 
less he never did." 

The strawberry is the perfect fruit. When they 
have ripened in our gardens, says Hommes, "summer 
has begun" hardly till then, and they mark pretty 
nearly the true astronomical beginning of the season. 

While we have the berry in the market from Christ- 
mas on, the real desire for them does not come until 
spring is turning into summer. It is true, unfortu- 

86 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

nately, that some find the acid of the berry does not 
agree with them, but these are only exceptions and 
they have been recommended to persons of gouty or 
bilious tendency. 

STRAWBERRIES EN CASSEROLE 

Bake in a small, round fluted cake pan a hot water 
sponge cake. Have ready two cups of berries cut in 
halves, two cups of sweetened whipped cream, some 
powdered sugar, and a half dozen perfect berries. 

Before the cake is chilled, cut off the top about an 
inch thick and take out the center of the cake with a 
fork, leaving a shell in which to put the berries, first 
lining it thickly with some of the whipped crecim. 
Sprinkle the berries, as they are put into the shell with 
powdered sugar. Cover with the top of the cake and 
heap the balance of the whipped cream on it. 

Distribute the whole berries over the cream. 

STRAWBERRY QUEEN 
MATERIALS: 

1 quart strawberries 1 cup sugar 

1 tablespoon of gelatine 1 cup of thick whipped 

(granulated) cream 

Sponge cake cut in small Whites of 2 eggs 
dice 
PREPARATION : 

Dissolve the gelatine in a little cold water. Crush 
and strain one-half of the berries. Bring the juice with 
the sugar to the boiling point and add the gelatine. 
When partially chilled, add the stiffly beaten egg whites 
and whip up together. Place on the ice until needed. 
When ready to serve, line a glass dish with a layer 
of the diced cake, then a layer of the gelatine. Alternate 
until the dish is filled, then cover the dish with the 
sweetened whipped cream and scatter the balance of 
the berries over the cream.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

STRAWBERRY CUSTARD 
Stem enough perfect berries to line a glass dish. 
Cut them in halves and arrange them so that while lin- 
ing the dish they do not fill it, sprinkle with sugar. 

Put one pint of milk into a double boiler. Mix a 
heaping teaspoon of flour with one-half cup of sugar 
and stir into the milk, beat up the yolks of three eggs, 
add a little cold milk or water and stir into the milk. 
Cook until creamy and slightly thick. Beat the whites 
of the eggs, one-half cup of sugar and half a dozen 
crushed berries till very stiff. Pour the custard into 
the glass dish without breaking down the lining of the 
berries. 

Drop the meringue in heaps over it. This is one of 
the most quickly prepared, delicious strawberry des- 
serts. 

STRAWBERRY PATES 

A novel way of serving the strawberry is to half fill 
puff pastry shells with sweetened whipped cream and 
fill the balance with berries. Make a border around 
the edge of the pate shell with stiffly whipped cream to 
which a few drops of green vegetable coloring has been 
added. 

STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE 
All measures level unless otherwise stated 
MATERIALS FOR PASTRY: 

2 cups flour 1 cup milk 

3 level teaspoons of 1 heaping tablespoon of short- 

Calumet Baking ening, either lard, butter. 

Powder or butterine 

1 teaspoon salt 1 quart of berries 

1 cup sugar Butter, whipped cream 

PREPARATION: 

Sift the flour, salt and baking powder, mix in the 
shortening with a spatula or fork. Add enough of the 

88 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

milk to make a soft dough. Divide the dough in two 
parts. Roll out each and brush with butter, place one 
on top of the other in a shallow baking tin and bake 
about twelve to fifteen minutes in a hot oven. 

Remove from the pan to a hot chop plate or large 
platter and take off the upper layer. Spread each with 
butter. 

Mix the sugar and berries and cover the lower layer 
with them. Place the top and cover it with the whipped 
cream. A few perfect berries may be reserved to dis- 
tribute over the whipped cream. 

If plain cream is to be used instead of the whipped 
cream, powdered sugar may be sifted lightly over the 
top of the shortcake and the cream served from a 
pitcher. 

STRAWBERRY SAUCE 

This is excellent served with plain boiled rice, or 
bread puddings, or a scarcely sweetened blanc mange. 

Beat together one-third cupful of butter and a cup 
of sugar until white and light. Add to it the stiffly 
beaten white of one egg and a cupful of crushed berries. 
The success of this sauce depends upon the long 
beating. 

MARSHMALLOW SAUCE 

MATERIALS: 

1 cup sugar 1 tablespoon lemon juice 

Yz cup water 1 egg white 

4 tablespoons orange % pound marshmallows 

juice 

PREPARATION: 

Soak the marshmallows in the juice of lemon and 
orange juice one-half hour. 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 



Make a syrup of the sugar and water, cooking it 
about five minutes. Add the marshmallows with the 
fruit juices. Beat up the egg white very stiff and dry 
and whip into the sauce. 

BERRIES EN MERINGUE 
(A Novel and Attractive Dish) 

MATERIALS : 

1 quart of berries Sugar to serve 

6 slices of Angel or Bowl of meringue 

Sunshine cake 

MATERIALS FOR SUNSHINE CAKE: 

Yz cup of sifted pastry 10 level tablespoons granu- 

flour lated sugar 

4 egg whites 3 egg yolks 



Yz level teaspoon of 
Calumet Baking 
Powder 



PREPARATION: 

Sift the flour once before measuring and once after 
measuring. Separate the eggs. Beat the egg yolks 
until stifE and lemon colored. Whip the whites until the 
dish can be inverted without spilling. 

Whip the sugar into the ^^z whites and then whip 
in the beaten egg yolks. When thoroughly whipped in 
add the baking powder, whipping lightly. Then fold 
in the flour. 

Pour the batter into a small loaf pan, a round pan 
with tube preferred. Bake in a moderate oven about 
thirty minutes. Allow to cool before removing from 
the pan. 

MATERIAL FOR MERINGUE: 

Yz cup confectioners sugar Y^ cup berries 
1 egg white 

90 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION: 

Drop the egg white with the sugar into deep, nar- 
row bowl or quart cup. Crush the berries through a 
sieve into the cup. Beat with a rotary egg beater until 
very stiff. Do not stop beating until very much stiffer 
than the white of egg would become if beaten alone. 
Have all materials and dish very cold. 

Just before time to serve make a border of slices of 
the cake about two inches from the edge of the glass 
plate or chop plate. Fill the center with berries. Dis- 
tribute the Meringue in a rough border around the 
cake. Piped through a pastry bag the Meringue will 
form more of a decoration but is not necessary. 

To serve, use berry spoon. Unless berries are very 
sour no other sweetening is required. 

Peaches pared and sliced may be used instead of 
berries. But in using peaches or berries which are not 
acid, a tablespoon of lemon juice must be used in mak- 
ing the Meringue. 

BERRY BATTER CUPS 

MATERIALS : 

Berries, sugar to sweeten 2 teaspoons butter (round- 
Batter : ing) 
1 cup flour % cup milk (scant) 
1 egg 1 teaspoon Calumet Baking 

Powder 

PREPARATION: 

Sift flour and baking powder, work in the butter 
with a fork, beat up the egg to which add the milk and 
beat all into the flour. Butter some ramekins or patty 
pans, drop a spoonful of the batter, then a spoonful of 
crushed fruit and sugar, make three layers of batter 
and two layers of fruit. Bake in moderate oven twenty- 
five minutes. Serve with either plain or whipped cream, 
unsweetened. 

91 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

If a sweet or custard sauce is desired, use the berries 
without sugar. 

CURRANT ROLL 

Wash and pick over enough red or white currants 
to fill a cup three times. Put into the sifter two cups 
of flour, two level tablespoons of sugar, two rounding 
teaspoons of Calumet Baking Powder, one teaspoon of 
salt, sift twice, work in with a fork one rounding table- 
spoon of butter or lard. Moisten the flour with about 
one cup of milk till a stiff dough is formed. Roll it out 
about one-half inch thick. Spread with the currants. 
Mix one cup of sugar with one heaping tablespoon of 
flour and sprinkle over the currants. Dot with small 
pieces of butter. Roll the pastry from you over and 
over like a jelly roll. Moisten the further side with a 
little water to hold it to a roll. Brush the roll with milk 
and place in a moderate oven to bake for about fifty- 
five minutes. Cover with another pan for the first fifteen 
minutes. 

This can also be steamed or better still, cooked in a 
fireless cooker that is supplied with the heated plates or 
bricks. When cut open the juice will form the sauce 
in which to serve it. 



CUSTARD SAUCE 

MATERIALS: 

1 cup milk 1 teaspoon flour (heaping) 

J/^ cup sugar 2 egg yolks 

PREPARATION: 

Place the milk in a double cooker. Mix the sugar 
and flour and add to the milk and cook till creamy. 

92 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 



Then add the egg yolks in which a Httle water has 
been mixed to prevent their becoming stringy. Allow 
to cook but a few moments after the egg yolks have 
been added. 

A half teaspoon of vanilla may be used for flavoring. 



CHOCOLATE SYRUP 



MATERIALS: 



8 level tablespoons grated 

chocolate 
1 cup hot water 



8 tablespoons sugar

of cold water and add it to the syrup. Melt the choco- 
late in a double boiler or in a saucepan over water. 
When melted pour in the boiling hot syrup and stir 
until well mixed. 

This syrup is served with ice cream and pudding, 
and is very rich. If desired it may be reduced with 
boiling water. When chilled it becomes a little creamy, 
but keeps indefinitely.

FROZEN DAINTIES 

FREEZING 

Pour the chilled cream into the freezer. Place the 
freezer in the pail and pack with ice nearly to the top. 
Sprinkle coarse salt uniformly on the ice as you pack 
it into the bucket. Cover and fasten the can and turn 
it slowy until it becomes difficult to turn. Open the 
can and remove the dasher. Scrape the cream from 
the sides of the can. Mix until smooth, close the can 
and drain off the brine. Add fresh ice and salt, cover- 
ing the entire can. Wrap a blanket around the freezer 
and let it stand two hours. In very hot weather renew 
the salt and ice three times and keep the blanket cold 
and wet with the brine from the freezer. 

In adding fruit to the creams, (such as peaches, 
pineapples, plums, oranges or apricots), it must be cut 
into small dice, sprinkled with sugar and allowed to 
stand two hours. 

Berries must be mashed, sugared and mixed with 
the frozen cream. Always thoroughly chill the cream 
before freezing it. It is then smoother and the chilling 
makes it freeze more rapidly and easily. 

CHERRY ICE CREAM 

Make a foundation ice cream or custard, flavoring it 
with cherry syrup, cordial, spiced cherries. Maraschino, 
or other form of preserved cherries. Use a few of the 
crushed kernels to flavor.

PASTRIES AND PIES 

PLAIN PASTRY 

MATERIALS: 

1 level cup lard 1 level teaspoon salt 

3 level cups flour Ice water to make soft dough 

1 level teaspoon Calumet 

PREPARATION: 

Select the very best open kettle rendered lard for 
pastry. If bread flour is used, great care must be taken 
that lard should measure fully 1/3 of the flour. Mate- 
rials should be chilled, either before or after the mixing. 
Sift the flour, salt and baking powder three times. 
Work in the shortening with a fork or spatula, roughly, 
leaving the shortening in flaky lumps, then add the ice 
water, still using a fork for the mixing. Too much 
water makes pie pastry shrink but on the other hand if 
not enough water is used the pastry will break around 
the edges before it can be rolled to shape the pan. 

When more pastry is mixed than can be used, place 
the balance in a cup or bowl and set away in the refriger- 
ator, and when ready to use press out about an inch 
thick, spread with lard or butterine, fold over and roll 
to desired shape. When a very flaky top crust is de- 
sired, treat pastry in the same way. 

PUFF PASTE 
MATERIALS : 

1 pound sifted pastry flour 1 teaspoon salt 
White of 1 egg 1 pound butter 

1 teaspoon sugar 1 cup ice water 

PREPARATION: 

Put the butter into a bowl in cold water, wash or 
work it under the water without pressing it into the 
bowl, until it becomes soft and elastic. Take off a piece 

105 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

the size of a large hen's egg, form the remaining quan- 
tity into a thin sheet, and lay it on a piece of cheese 
cloth on ice. 

Put the flour in the center of a large bowl, make a 
well in the center, put in the piece of butter, the salt, 
sugar, white of egg and half the water. Begin to work 
in the flour, and as the dough is formed add a little more 
water and more flour until you have a dough the con- 
sistency of bread dough. 

Dust the board with flour and knead the dough 
until it is soft and elastic, keeping your hands as cool 
as possible. Cut the dough into halves, roll each half 
out into a sheet half an inch thick. Dry the butter on 
the cheese cloth, dust it with flour on both sides, put it 
on one sheet, cover it with the other, fastening the edges 
together, and roll quickly from you, being careful not 
to break the dough. Fold in the sides, then the ends, 
turning the paste around so that the folds will run to 
and from you, roll from you and again fold as before. 
Place on a dry napkin, then on a dish and on the ice 
for fifteen minutes. Then roll again, having the fold 
in the same position, fold and roll again. Stand it on 
the ice for another fifteen minutes. Do this until you 
have given it six rolls or turns. Eight will make it 
lighter, if you know how to roll, but if it is your first 
trial six will be quite sufficient. Wrap it in a dry nap- 
kin, put it on a plate and in the refrigerator over night. 

PATE SHELLS 

When the puff paste has stood twenty-four hours, 
or over night, roll very thin, about one-fourth of an 
inch, cut rounds of paste with small fluted cooky cutter, 
three rounds or more for each pate. 

Make a mixture of one egg yolk and one-half cup 
of water, brush the round of paste with this, put one of 

106 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

the circles in place, brush it with the mixture, then add 
the other circle and brush again. 

Place in refrigerator to chill and then into a hot 
oven, reducing the heat after ten minutes. Fill with 
creamed oysters, sweetbreads or peas. 

BISMARCK TARTS 

Cut rounds of puff paste with a large biscuit or 
cookie cutter. Put a heaping teaspoon of raspberry or 
other jam in the center of each. Brush the edge with 
egg and water mixture, fold over so that the edges lay 
together. Set them in the refrigerator to chill, then put 
into a hot oven, reducing the heat after ten minutes. 

MINCE MEAT 
MATERIALS: 

4 pounds chopped or 1 heaping tablespoon of salt 

hamburg beef (raw) 2 pounds chopped suet 

3 pounds sugar, brown 3 pounds seeded raisins 

preferred 2 pounds citron 

3 pounds cleaned cur- 1 ounce or 4 tablespoons each 

rants of mace, nutmeg, cloves 

1 pound each of lemon and allspice 

and orange peel 3 gallons of peeled and quar- 

(candied) tered apples 
15^ ounces cinnamon 

Grated rind and juice of 4 lemons and oranges may 
be used. Or use cider to moisten, remembering that 
the apples will supply a great deal of juice. 

PREPARATION : 

Cut up the apples reasonably fine, put the orange 
and lemon peel through the food chopper, also the suet. 
Place all of the materials in the kettle except the suet 
and citron and cook until the apples are thoroughly 
cooked. Slice the citron in about inch pieces, this can 
more easily be accomplished by allowing it to stand in 
warm water for ten minutes. 

107 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Just before removing from the fire add the citron 
and suet. Brandy or wine may be added after cooling 
or may be used at the time of pie making.

MARTHA WASHINGTON PIE— No. 1 

MATERIALS (for cake part) : 

1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon flavoring extract 
5 level tablespoons soft or 2 cups pastry flour sifted be- 

melted shortening fore measuring 

2 level teaspoons Calumet Yz cup milk 

Baking Powder 2 eggs 

PREPARATION : 

Sift the flour and baking powder, separate the eggs, 
placing the whites in the mixing bowl, and beat very 
stiff with a rotary beater, add the yolks and beat again, 
then the sugar and shortening, beating sufficiently to 
mix well. Add the milk and flour, mix well and add 
the extract. 

Bake in well greased deep pie tins and after baking 
remove the center to permit of filling with the custard. 

The better way is to fill deepest large pie tin with 
the mixture about half full, then set in the center of 
that a pie tin about an inch and a half smaller in diam- 
eter which has been well greased on the bottom, thus 

108 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

leaving a depression without the waste or necessity of 
removing the center after baking. Make a meringue of 
the whites of the two eggs and two tablespoons of 
powdered sugar. Fill the pie with the filling, cover 
with the meringue and decorate it with shreds of 
maraschino cherries sprinkled over the surface. 

MARTHA WASHINGTON PIE FILLING 

MATERIALS : 

1 cup sugar 2 eggs 

6 level tablespoons flour 2 cups scalded milk 

1 teaspoon vanilla Pinch of salt 

PREPARATION : 

Have the scalded milk in the upper vessel of a 
double boiler. Mix the flour and sugar and stir into 
the milk. Add the yolks of the eggs slightly beaten 
and the salt. Add the vanilla. 

MARTHA WASHINGTON PIE— No. 2 

Make a rich soft cookie mixture. Roll out as for 
pie crust and line a pie tin. Bake and when cool fill 
with the custard filling as in Martha Washington Pie, 
No. 1. Finish with meringue and decorate with cher- 
ries. 

ORANGE MARMALADE PIE 

MATERIALS : 

2 oranges 2 heaping tablespoons flour 
Yz lemon (juice and rind) 2 egg yolks 

1^ cups sugar 3 egg whites 

1 cup water 3 tablespoons powdered sugar

Slice the half lemon and one-half of an orange into 
a small saucepan with one-half cup of sugar and one- 
half cup of water. Cook like a marmalade. 

109 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Squeeze the juice from the remaining orange and a 
half, mix with the balance of the sugar, flour, water and 
two egg yolks, and cook in double boiler until thick, 
then add the marmalade. Pour into two baked pastry 
shells. Cover with a meringue made from the egg 
whites and powdered sugar. 

A few drops of lemon juice or a pinch of cream of 
tartar, will make the meringue finer and lighter. 

Sufficient for two pies. 

RAISIN PIE 

Raisin pie used to be looked upon as a makeshift. 
Everything else failing, groceries not delivered and the 
dinner hour approaching, there were always raisins or 
dried currants in the larder, from which to make a pie. 
You will find more men, especially New Englanders, 
speak of the juicy richness of mother's raisin pie. And 
the pioneers can look back to the time when the more 
perishable pie-stuffs were not to be had at any price. 

To make the raisin pie, use either the seeded or 
seedless raisins, measure two cups for a medium pie. 
Rinse them well, pour over them just enough boiling 
water to barely cover. Allow them to stand where 
they will remain just below the boiling point and puff 
up well. 

Make a rich pastry to cover bottom of the pie pan 
and for a latticed top. 

To one cup of sugar add and mix well one heaping 
tablespoon of flour. Add this to the raisins and pour 
into the pie tin. Dot with a heaping teaspoon of butter 
and put the strips for the lattice cover in place, moist- 
ening the edge of the pastry to make the ends of the 
strips adhere. Bake one-half hour in a medium oven. 

This may be made doubly rich by serving with it 
ice cream or whipped cream piped over it just before 
serving. It may be eaten warm or cold. 

110 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 



In preparing the pastry for the lattice top it will 
be all the lighter by pressing the pastry about one-half 
inch thick and buttering it as you would a piece of 
bread and then folding it over from each side, doubling 
it, then rolling to the desired thickness. 



RAISIN PIE— No. 2 
MATERIALS : 

1 heaping cup raisins 1 cup sugar 

Yz cup sour cream ^ cup fine bread crumbs 

Water to scald raisins Rich pastry 

PREPARATION : 

Scald the raisins and drain, then place in rich pastry. 
Mix the sugar, bread crumbs and cream and pour over 
the raisins. Cover with lattice top, bake half hour in 
moderate oven. 

MOCK CHERRY PIE 
MATERIALS : 

1 pint cranberries 1 cup sugar 

Yz cup seeded raisins — "%. teaspoon vanilla 

put through food 1 level tablespoon flour 
chopper mixed with sugar 

PREPARATION: 

Cut each cranberry in two and place them over the 
fire with as little water as possible. Boil but a moment 
then remove from the fire and add the raisins, sugar 
and vanilla. 

Line a shallow pie tin with a rich pastry, pour in the 
filling, dot with a little butter and cover with either a 
lattice of pastry or entirely. 

Ill 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Always remember to moisten the rim of the under 
pastry before pressing the upper one closely to it. This 
precaution, with a vent in the upper crust, will prevent 
the juice from running out of the pie. 



KASE KUCHEN (Cheese Pie) 
MATERIALS : 

4 eggs Grated rind and juice of 1 

1 cup sugar lemon 

2 cups cottage cheese 

PREPARATION : 

Beat the eggs without separating, add the sugar and 
the cheese, which has been rubbed smooth through a 
sieve. Then add the rind and juice of the lemon. This 
may be cooked in a double boiler and then turned into 
the baked pastry shell, and is the better way. But it 
may be put into the unbaked pastry and baked one-half 
hour in a moderate oven. 

Cooked first in the double boiler, it may also serve 
as a filling for tarts, in which case a maraschino cherry 
should be placed in the center of each. 

Sufficient for two pies. 

CREAM PIE 

Filling for one pie 

MATERIALS : 

1% cups sweet milk 2 egg whites (whipped) 

^2 cup sugar Vanilla to flavor 

ys cup flour Pastry for 1 pie 

2 teaspoons butter 

112 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Cover a medium size pie tin with rich pastry and 
bake. Place one and one-half cups milk in double 
boiler. Mix the flour and sugar thoroughly and add to 
hot milk. When thickening, add the egg whites and 
whip in, then butter and flavoring. 

Pour into baked pastry when slightly cooled. 

This is much nicer than putting the uncooked filling 
into the unbaked pastry and then baking, although this 
is often done. 



CUSTARD PIE 

MATERIALS: 

3 eggs 1 heaping teaspoon flour 

1 pint sweet milk 4 heaping tablespoons sugar 

PREPARATION : 

Beat the eggs just enough to blend thoroughly, add 
the sugar, then the flour. Heat the milk and stir in the 
mixture. Flavor to taste and bake in a raw crust until 
the custard is set. 



LEMON PIE 

Filling for one pie 
MATERIALS: 

54 cup granulated sugar 1 heaping tablespoon flour or 
^ cup hot water 1 thick slice of bread 

1 lemon, juice and rind 2 egg yolks 

Pastry shell 
113 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

MERINGUE 

2 egg whites Few drops lemon juice 

2 tablespoons powdered 
sugar 

PREPARATION: 

Grate the lemon and reserve half of the grated rind 
for the meringue. 

Mix the granulated sugar and flour, add the hot 
water and lemon juice and rind. Cook in double boiler 
till thickened. Beat the egg yolks slightly and mix 
with a tablespoon of water and add to the mixture. 

When cooled pour into the baked pastry and spread 
with the meringue. 

PREPARATION OF MERINGUE: 

Put the whites of the eggs into deep, narrow bowl 
and beat foamy with a rotary egg-beater. Then add 
one-half level teaspoon of CALUMET Baking Powder 
and beat till stiff, add the sugar and beat very thor- 
oughly. Place under broiler flame for a moment or 
two to brown, or in an oven with good top heat. 



PIE-PLANT PIE 

MATERIALS: 

2 cups pie plant 1 tablespoon flour (rounding) 

1 cup sugar 1 tablespoon butter (level) 

Pastry 

PREPARATION : 

Cut the pie-plant in inch long pieces after washing, 
but not peeling. Mix the sugar and flour. Sprinkle 
over the pie-plant in layers in the pastry. Dot with 

114 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

pieces of butter. Moisten the edges of the pastry and 
press down the edge of the cover well. Make openings 
for steam vent. Bake in moderate oven thirty minutes. 

FRUIT PIES 

Apple, green tomato, blueberry, raspberry, black- 
berry and cranberry pies require the same treatment 
as pieplant pie, the amount of sugar depending upon 
the flavor of the fruit. The rule is about one cupful 
of sugar and three tablespoonfuls of flour with a few 
dots of butter. 

Spice may or may not be used, to suit the taste. 

If the fruit like pieplant or cranberries are very acid 
a half teaspoonful of soda may be sifted with the sugar 
and flour. 

The blueberry and cranberry pies are often covered 
with a lattice instead of an entire cover of pastry. 

DUTCH APPLE PIE 

Select apples which will quickly cook tender. Line 
a pie tin with rich pastry, make a small braid or twist 
of pastry to border the pan. Mix 2 tablespoonfuls of 
flour and 1 tablespoonful of cinnamon with 1 cupful 
of sugar. Cut the apples into thick slices or eighths. 
Arrange them overlapping in the pastry shell. Sprinkle 
with the sugar, dot with butter. Cover for the first 
15 minutes and bake 30 to 40 minutes. 

PINEAPPLE PIE FILLING 
MATERIALS : 

2 cups shredded pine- "%, cup cream (sweet or sour) 

apple or equivalent in Yz lemon, juice and rind 

fresh fruit 1 level tablespoon butter 

1 cup sugar 3 egg yolks

115 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

This filling may be mixed and baked in either an un- 
covered pastry or with lattice. 

It may be cooked in a saucepan and poured when 
cold into a baked pastry shell or into tart shells. 

The egg whites may be made into a Meringue with 
three tablespoons of sugar. The Meringue can then be 
spread over the pies or if tarts are made the Meringue 
may be heaped on the filling. 

SCOTCH APPLE TART 

MATERIALS : 

Pastry 1 cup raisins, (seeded) 

2 cups stewed apples Sugar to sweeten 

Slivers of thin rind of 
lemon 

PREPARATION:

CAKES 

AND THEIR PROCESS 

The housewife who can serve to her family and 
guests dainty and rich cakes is the envy of her less for- 
tunate sisters, and perhaps her near friend will ex- 
claim, "you always do have such luck with your cakes." 

Perhaps luck may enter into the work once in a 
while, and sometimes too, a clever guess may be made 
as to the materials, but guesswork spells failure more 
often than success. 

Neither does the art of cake making consist in the 
possession of numerous recipes. It depends upon cer- 
tain fundamental rules and a certain knowledge of the 
application of heat. Some people grasp these things 
intuitively, while others have to give more thought to 
the subject. 

For instance, eggs and their manipulation are one 
of the main stumbling blocks, although each detail of 
cake making is important. Eggs contain albumen, which 
coagulates at about 130 degrees Fahr., while flour has 
to be subjected to a much greater heat in order to cook 
the starch. Therefore it will readily be understood that 
all cakes must rise to their full extent before browning 
over the top or applying heat enough to cook the flour. 

A quickly effervescing baking powder is also to be 
avoided in the making of cakes. If a quickly effer- 
vescing baking powder is used, it should be held back 
until the cake is ready for the pan, when it should be 
beaten in thoroughly and the batter immediately put 
into the pan for baking. More important still is the 
proportion of baking powder. 

Accuracy in measurement of all materials is abso- 
lutely necessary. Every kitchen should be provided 
with one or two of the glass or tin measuring cups and 

117 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

with them this accuracy can be obtained. Other tools 
necessary for the cake making are the egg whip for the 
whites of the egg and a rotary beater for the yolks, a 
wooden spoon with slotted bowl for the creaming of 
butter and sugar and mixing. The large size ordinary 
milk crock is superior to any other mixing bowl. 

For the baking of cakes the aluminum pans with the 
tubes are a little better than those without. Do not 
grease the sides of the cake pans. Grease the bottom 
and flour. A paper is necessary for fruit loaf cakes and 
for any cake baked in a long sheet. Do not grease 
either paper or pan, unless the paper does not entirely 
cover the bottom of the pan. Then grease the uncov- 
ered bottom and corners. 

Prepare the pans first, then prepare and measure all 
the materials before beginning the mixing. The whites 
and yolks of the eggs should be beaten separately unless 
the recipe specifically directs otherwise. If the butter 
is cold and hard, warm the sugar slightly or add a 
couple of tablespoons of hot water to the sugar. 
Never melt the butter. Cream the butter and sugar 
thoroughly, until white and curdled. 

In making measurements, level off the cup or spoon 
with a knife. The proper proportion of baking powder 
is one level teaspoon for each level cup of flour. Cakes 
are never as delicious made with bread flour as with 
winter wheat or pastry flour. All cake recipes presup- 
pose that winter wheat flour is to be used. Therefore, 
if bread flour is used, the measurement must be one- 
fifth less as bread flour takes up more moisture, or sub- 
stitute for one-third of the flour an equal amount of 
corn starch or rice starch. 

HIGH ALTITUDES 

Almost all cake recipes are compounded for low 
altitude and the amount or proportion of flour depends 

118 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 



on the altitude. For instance, a cake recipe calling for 
two and one-half cups of flour in ordinary altitude would 
in Butte or Denver, or any point in the mountains, re- 
quire three cups, about one-fifth, more flour. 

Do not use butter for greasing the pans, as there is 
the same objection to it as in all other forms of cook- 
ing, it burns too easily. Use vegetable oil or lard. 

Begin the baking of cakes in a low oven, 220 degrees 
Fahr. As soon as the cake batter has risen to its full 
extent, increase the heat and when well set and lightly 
browned, reduce the heat if not quite baked. 

The texture of a cake containing many eggs may be 
toughened by too hot an oven, just the same as a puff 
omelet is spoiled by over cooking. 

If sour milk is used, neutralize its acid with the 
smallest bit of soda and use about half as much baking 
powder as with sweet milk. 

If fruit or nuts sink to the bottom of the cake, it 
shows that the batter is too thin. 

An accurate unit of measure could not be established 
for unsifted flour, as its density differs. That is why we 
always say sift the flour once before measuring. Then 
add the baking powder and sift two or three times to 
insure the perfect mixing of the two materials. 

When cakes are properly mixed and the materials 
proportioned, there is no danger of the usual activity 
around the house disturbing the cake or causing it to fall 
when an efficient baking powder, Calumet, is used. When 
many egg whites are required a few drops of lemon 
juice added to the whites when beaten foamy will be an 
advantage, as the acid has the property of keeping the 
air cells intact. This is particularly desirable in the 
making of Meringues. 

A cake is ready to take from the oven when it will 
spring back after a slight pressure of the finger. 

119 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Cakes baked in shallow or layer cake pans require 
about one-fifth more flour than when baked in loaf 
pans. A corresponding proportion of baking powder 
should also be used. 

Before the advent of baking powder, cakes were 
made without leavening in some instances, such as fruit 
cakes and pound cakes, but the digestive habit of the 
people is different from that of sixty years ago, we now 
demand that bread and cake mixtures be leavened in 
order that the digestive process is not overtaxed as it 
would be by the admission of heavy cakes and breads. 

You are therefore advised that when some of the 
old-fashioned fruit cake recipes are brought out for use, 
that you add soda to neutralize the acid of the molasses, 
jellies or sour milk that enter into their composition. 
Do not perpetuate such a dietetic blunder as to serve 
the family with cakes which are not lightened and made 
digestible with a good quality baking powder. 

Use of soda should be restricted to the amxount 
necessary to neutralize or counteract the acid of the 
milk or molasses. Please understand that not enough 
carbon dioxide would be thus generated to leaven the 
amount of flour used for such mixtures, therefore, it is 
necessary to supply the carbon dioxide in the form of 
baking powder in the proportion of half a level tea- 
spoon to each cup of flour, when soda is used to correct 
the acid of molasses or sour milk. 

ADJUSTING OVEN 

The tendency of many ovens is to accumulate too 
great a heat in the upper part. It is sometimes neces- 
sary to place a shallow pan on the upper rack directly 
over the cake. The pan need not have any water in it. 

Appearance while baking is guide to manipulating 
the heat. The cake should look raw and bubbly over 

120 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

the top until just as high as it is going to be, then in- 
crease the heat slightly. The last ten minutes of bak- 
ing, the heat is usually decreased.

MATERIALS: (for custard): 

2 level teaspoons cinnamon 2 level teaspoons allspice 

2 level teaspoons cloves 1 level teaspoon nutmeg 

1 level teaspoon mace 2 squares chocolate 

6 level tablespoons sugar 6 level tablespoons milk 

MATERIALS (for cake) : 

2^ cups sifted flour 4 eggs

2^ level teaspoons Calu- % cup butter 
met Baking Powder 

PREPARATION : 

To make the custard put the broken chocolate into 
a small bowl over hot water, add the sugar, spices and 
milk. Stir until smooth when set aside to cool while 
mixing the cake. 

Sift the flour once before measuring. Measure into 
the sifter, add the CALUMET and sift three times. 
Cream the butter and sugar until frothy. Beat the 
yolks of the eggs until thick and lemon colored, then 
beat into the creamed butter and sugar. Whip the egg 
whites stiff and add lightly to the mixture, pour in the 
milk, sift in the flour and mix until smooth. Then beat 
the custard into the batter until thoroughly mixed. 

This cake baked in a loaf pan must bake about forty 
to forty-five minutes and heat must be regulated so 
that cake will rise as high as it will before browning 
over the top. 

Baked in layer pans it requires one-half cup more of 
flour and one-half level teaspoon of Calumet. When 
baked this cake is very smooth and rich. If baked in 
layers and put together with meringue icing in which 
chopped nuts, raisins and figs are mixed it is an exceed- 
ingly rich cake.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR FRUIT CAKES 

When planning to make fruit cake make a list of 
all materials needed, and check off those at hand. 

Prepare all fruits, nuts, etc., the day before mixing 
and baking. 

To prepare citron, lemon and orange peel, drop them 
into hot water for a few minutes, after which they can 
be easily sliced or chopped. 

Cleanse all fruits and chop or slice as determined by 
recipe, the day previous. Prepare pan by fitting with 
two or three thicknesses of note paper or heavy wrap- 
ping paper. Cut the paper so that corners of pans are 
not crowded with paper. Grease the pans only where 
the paper does not cover. Do not grease the paper. 

The mixing of the cake is accomplished the same 
as with other cakes. Then the fruit is floured and added 
the last thing. 

To bake the fruit cake place the pans in a large drip- 
ping pan or roaster. Pour cold water to the depth of 
one and one-half inches. Do not allow the water to 
entirely dry out but add boiling water if required. 
Bake fruit cake from two to three hours, depending 
upon the size. The oven should be regulated to 240 
degrees Fahrenheit for the first hour, and increasing 
slightly before taking cakes from the oven. Cover each 
cake loosely until half an hour of removing from the 
oven. 

Fruit cakes may be kept indefinitely if thoroughly 
baked and kept where dampness will not cause mold. 

One old-fashioned precaution was to sprinkle cakes 
with brandy. 

Brandy was used in place of sherry or grape juice. 
However, the two latter ingredients make the cake less 
indigestible. Whiskey is entirely out of place and 
ruinous to the flavor. 

125

A good heavy covering of icing tends to preserve 
fruit cake and is to be recommended.

and orange peel through the food chopper, follow with 
half of the raisins and then the salt pork, freed from 
lean meat and skin. 

Put all the materials that have been put through the 
food chopper into a mixing bowl, pour over these the 
pint of boiling water in which the soda has been dis- 
solved, add the molasses, sugar and spices. Flour the 
raisins, currants and citron with the one-half cup of

ure, add the Calumet baking powder and sift three times. 

Beat up the eggs without separating and add to the 
mixture in the mixing bowl, then add the flour and stir 
hard. Add the fruit and nuts. This mixture is suffi- 
cient for two large cake pans, with tubes, such as the 
ten-egg angel cake is baked in. Do not attempt to bake 
this in a large pan without the tube, but it may be baked 
in the half-size cake tins or individual bread tins. 
Great care must be taken to bake the cake slowly, allow- 
ing it to rise to its full capacity before forming a crust 
over the top. Bake not less than forty-five minutes.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

pan. Bake in a slow oven, putting one pan into the 
oven slightly in advance of the other so as to have the 
first rolled before the other is ready, as they must not 
be allowed to cool before rolling. 

They are ready to take from the oven when they will 
spring back after a slight pressure of the finger on the 
center. 

While baking, place your jelly in readiness, and a 
thin knife or spatula with which to spread it. Lay a 
damp towel on your table, and just before removing 
your cake from the oven, lay a dry towel over the damp 
one and sprinkle with a tablespoon of granulated sugar. 

Turn the cake onto this and if the edges have become 
crisp in the baking, trim them with a sharp knife, then 
quickly and evenly spread the jelly very thin. Take 
the end of the upper towel near you and holding it firmly 
roll the cake over and over, without allowing the towel 
to roll with it. Allow it to stand five minutes, when it 
will be ready to slice or lay away.

3/^ cup bread flour almonds 

% cup sugar 2 eggs 

1 teaspoon lemon juice 

PREPARATION: 

Sift the flour three times. Cream the butter and 
sugar, add the eggs, beaten without separating, the 
lemon juice, flour, and the nuts. Drop onto greased 
baking sheets or bottom of dripping pan. Bake a very 
light brown. 

MACAROONS 

In order to cover the subject thoroughly, I will ex- 
plain the most satisfactory method of blanching al- 
monds. 

After shelling the almonds, pour over them boiling 
water to completely cover. Allow them to remain not 
less than five minutes. Then throw them into a coarse 
strainer and set it in a dish of cold water. All that 
is necessary to remove the skin is to press between the 
thumb and finger. Do not throw the skins back in the 
dish to handle over again. Drop the almonds into cold 
water until all are blanched, and then drain and lay on 
towel to dry. 

188 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

MATERIALS : 

1/4 cups blanched Yz cup powdered sugar 

almonds Whites of 3 eggs 

34 cup granulated sugar 

PREPARATION : 

Put the almonds through the finest knife of the 
food chopper. They should come out of the food chop- 
per in a paste. 

Have the ^%^ whites in a glass ready to use, also the 
sugars measured. Pour about a quarter of the granu- 
lated sugar into the nut paste and work it in with the 
hand, much as butter and sugar are creamed for a 
cake. Then add about a third of the egg. Add the 
balance of the sugar and the eggs. Then last of all 
add the powdered sugar. 

If possible use large baking sheets or shallow tins. 
Cut to barely fit them sheets of writing or wrapping 
paper. Do not grease either the tins or the paper. 

Make a cornucopia of wrapping paper doubled. Put 
in the paste and drop onto the paper in little dabs about 
the size of a large nutmeg, about two inches apart. 
These will spread as soon as dropped. This quantity 
will make about seven dozen macaroons. They must 
be baked in a medium hot oven to a delicate brown. 

If you have observed the macaroons made by the 
bakers, you will have seen that the surface has a broken, 
mottled appearance. When taken from the oven place 
the papers, macaroon side down, on the cake board, and 
lay a towel wrung from cold water over them. This 
will cause them to sweat. Then with a knife they can 
be easily removed. 

If made according to the directions above given, 
these macaroons will have the same appearance as 
those of the professionals, but are much more tender. 
There is not much economy in making them at home, 
but a daintier article is the result.

FONDANT 

Few housewives know the value of the fondant. 
This is one of the many "short cuts" with which I ad- 
vise the busy housewife to fortify against the unex- 
pected, and to reduce kitchen work to a minimum. 

Let me counsel the beginner not to be discouraged 
if the fondant is not just right the first time or two. No 
matter how explicit the instructions may be, atmos- 
pheric conditions and the utensils used may operate 
against success. A certain amount of judgment, or per- 
haps instinct is the correct name for that quality which 
is necessary for success, must enter into the work. 

The recipe for fondant may be increased to enable 
the cook to have a supply on hand for emergencies. 
There is a point in the boiling beyond which you may 
not go. If you see, after cooling and kneading as per 
instructions, that it is not just right, return to the sauce- 
pan and add water and boil again. You will get to 
know after one or two trials just what the consistency 
must be. One more word of advice, use an aluminum 
saucepan, if possible, as the heat is more evenly dis- 
tributed than in a granite pan. 

This fondant is in general use as the cream for choco- 
late and other candies, as well as for icing.

FONDANT ICING 

MATERIALS: 

1 pound sugar XXXX confectioners sugar 

Yz cup water 1 tablespoon boiling water 

PREPARATION: 

Boil the sugar and water until the syrup will spin 
a heavy thread when dropped into cold water. Care- 
fully pour the syrup out on a large platter. When 
cool enough to bear your finger in it, stir the mixture 
rapidly until it is soft, white and creamy. Dust your 
bread board with XXXX sugar, turn the mixture on 
it and knead it as you would biscuit dough until it is 
very soft and smooth. Let it cool, place in your double 
boiler and melt, stirring all the time. 

Add one tablespoon of boiling water, flavor to taste 
and pour over the cake while hot. 



CHERRY ICING 

Allow four tablespoons of cherry juice to one cup 
of granulated sugar, cooking together until the syrup 
threads. Beat this into the stiffly whipped white of 
an egg.

frigerator to be baked and served hot for a later meal. 
Raisins may be added and in their season, one cup of 
blueberries will add greatly to the muffins. 

BRAN BREAD 

The following recipe for a health bread was pre- 
scribed by a physician for a patient of sedentary habit. 
As a choice between bran and drugs, the bran is per- 
haps the better of the two. 
MATERIALS : 

3 cups whole wheat flour Buttermilk to make soft dough 

3 tablespoons New 1 cup bran 

Orleans molasses Pinch of salt 

1 level teaspoon soda 1 level teaspoon Calumet 

Baking Powder 
PREPARATION : 

Stir all of the ingredients together. Bake about 
forty-five minutes in a moderately hot oven. This is 
usually baked in a Buster Brown tin or in a tea or coffee 
can, that will leave as little of the surface exposed to 
crust over. 

I would prefer to make this entirely of unsifted gra- 
ham flour, as the amount of bran would be about the 
same. The chances are that it would be more cleanly 
than loose bran bought at a feed store. 

COLONIAL BREAD 
(Whole Wheat) 
MATERIALS: 

2 cups whole wheat flour 1^ cups sweet milk 
4^ level teaspoons Calu- 1 cup white flour 

met Baking Powder 1 level teaspoon salt

pecan meats 

157 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Sift the dry materials, add the milk and mix with a 
knife. Add the nut meats. Place in well greased bread 
pans. Let stand fifteen minutes. Bake in moderate 
oven one hour. 

When in the oven half the time, one-half hour, turn 
the pan over. Currants, raisins or dates may be sub- 
stituted for nut meats. 

TWIN BISCUIT 

MATERIALS : 

2 cups flour 1 level teaspoon salt 

3 level teaspoons Calumet 4 level tablespoons lard or 

Baking Powder butterine 

Y/[ cup milk, more or less 

PREPARATION : 

Sift the flour, Calumet and salt three or four times. 
Work in the shortening with a spatula or fork. Then 
make a soft dough with the milk. 

This recipe makes eighteen twin biscuit cut with 
medium cutter. 

Roll out half an inch thick. Brush generously with 
some melted shortening. Fold over and run the rolling 
pin over the dough or pat lightly together. Cut out 
with a fluted cooky cutter. 

Brush tops with milk. 

Bake ten minutes in medium hot oven. These may 
be prepared some hours before baking, placed in the 
pans and kept in cool place until ready to take place at 
table when they may be put into the oven. 

In this way the biscuit may be served piping hot 
after the preliminary or first course is disposed of. 

Twin biscuit are just the thing for individual straw- 
berry shortcakes, also for serving with chicken fricasee, 
family style.

with water and roll the pastry from you in a firm roll. 
Brush with melted shortening. 

Cut off in half-inch slices, place in greased and 
floured pan and bake fifteen minutes in moderate oven. 

To prevent the syrup formed by the sugar from 
cooking onto the pan, the recipe for pastry may be in- 
creased one-third. Roll out one-third of the pastry very 
thin and cut rounds from it to cover bottom of pan. 
Then place each slice of the roll on a round. This looks 
fussy, but conserves all of the goodness as well as time 
and energy in cleaning baking pan.

YEAST BREADS 

In the development of yeast SUGAR is the SPUR, 
SALT the BRIDLE. 

Necessary conditions for the propagation of the 
yeast germ are warmth and moisture — product is 

CO2 +CaH60. 

The yeast plant thrives on sugar and starch which 
is in the flour. As it develops the process produces 
alcohol and a lactic acid — later on another change pro- 
duces acetic fermentation due to bacteria and known as 
souring. A tiny bit of soda may be used to overcome 
this tendency. But the formation of acetic acid must 
be regarded as an accident due to carelessness. How- 
ever, the tiny bit of soda will do no harm. 

DISEASES OF BREAD 

Care must be taken to insure against the formation 
of foreign bacteria by a sanitary cleanliness of vessels 
and coverings with which doughs are surrounded. The 
conditions that will spoil jellies and preserves and cause 
them to mould will produce dangerous conditions in 
bread and flours. Such conditions are induced by dark 
and damp storage places. It was the experience of one 
very particular housekeeper that moving from a sixth 
floor apartment to a house with cellar cupboards in 
which she stored her jellies that the jellies which had 
kept perfectly for a year in the apartment were, inside 
of eight weeks, covered with green mould. The cellar 
and cupboards were apparently clean but not sanitarily 
clean. When once the bread utensils are infected only 
a thorough overhauling will eradicate the fungus. The 
common disease from fungus growth develops first in 
the center of the loaf, the growth (mycelium) permeat- 
ing the entire loaf, causing a stringy, pasty condition. 

167 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

COMPRESSED YEAST is skimmed from fer- 
mented rye mixed with starch and pressed. Each cake 
of compressed yeast contains fifty billion yeast cells. 

Present day conditions make it unnecessary for the 
housewife to use home-made yeast as the compressed 
yeast is as rapid as the best home-made soft yeast and 
far more dependable. 

The dry yeasts found in the market are scientifically 
prepared and as economical as those made at home. 

The manufactured yeasts are standardized as to 
amount of leavening. 

The home-made yeasts cannot be standardized. 

One of the frequent faults in bread making is the 
use of too much yeast. 

In making rolls, rusks or buns in which eggs and 
shortening are used, start the dough with a sponge. 

The grain will be finer and the bread whiter if well 
kneaded, due to the aeration or bringing in of oxygen 
to the dough. The sponge or doughs should be set 
away in a warm (75 degrees Fahr.) moist place until 
leavened to double their bulk. 

In the absence of the proof-box as used by bakers for 
bread raising, a good substitute may be had in the oven 
of the gas range, by placing a dish of hot water under 
the lower shelf or rack of the oven. Understand, the 
oven is not to be heated or lighted. A cupboard is very 
easily arranged with open or slatted shelves for this 
purpose where no gas range is in use. 

A great many housewives now make use of the fire- 
less cookers for setting the sponge and dough to rise, 
but for pans of bread or rolls there is nothing quite 
equal to the proofing cupboard, as it insures against 
drafts and does away with the covering of the pans. 

A large crock or jar is to be preferred for the setting 
of sponges or doughs as the stoneware is not susceptible 
to varyiucg temperature.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

If fresh mashed potatoes are not at hand or con- 
venient, one-half cup flour, scalded may be used. In 
either case the cooked starch supplies the proper food 
and conditions to promote the rapid development of 
the yeast plant. 

Make this the basis of all yeast doughs, whether 
recipes call for it or not. Less yeast is required and a 
much better bread or roll is the result. 

Knead yeast dough until it is full of small bubbles, 
discernible by blisters over the surface of the dough. 

Set to rise in warm, steamy atmosphere until doubled 
in bulk. Roll dough should not be mixed as stiff as 
bread dough. 

Sponges must not be allowed to stand too long. 

The sponge is ready to mix when bubbles gather on 
the surface and break occasionally. 

THREE MINUTE YEAST FORMULA 

This is something new and is used by some of the 
better" class chefs and bakers. 

MATERIALS: 

3 tablespoons of flour — pour in a teacup of boiling 
water. Cool to 120 degrees Fahr. Add 1 teaspoon 
Malt extract and ^ cake dry yeast. 

PREPARATION: 

Whip for one minute with a rotary egg beater, cover 
and place where warm till night, then set bread with it. 

FOUR HOUR OR LIGHTNING BREAD 

Use the same formula as for plain "White Bread," 
with two cakes of yeast instead of one. 

Mashed potatoes will hasten the process also.

HEALTH BREADS 
(Coarse Flour Breads) 

As to the wholesomeness of health breads, author- 
ities differ. Many years ago health faddists made 
strong claims for the graham and other coarse flours, 
condemning the white and patent flours as some of the 
breakfast food companies are still doing. 

Graham flour has for its principal quality the outer 
covering of the wheat kernel and is too often an inferior 
flour mixed with coarse bran. People of sedentary 
habits and sluggish digestive action found that it had a 
direct effect upon the lower intestine. That this effect 
is ultimately good is a question, as the effect is brought 
about by the irritation of the bran in the digestive 
channels, causing increased peristaltic action. This ex- 
traordinary peristaltic action may have the effect of 
hurrying along accompanying foods, preventing their 
absorption into the system, and carrying them off as 
waste. 

Whole wheat flour is free from this objectionable 
feature of the graham and contains more of the phos- 
phates and germ of wheat than the patent flours. Made 
up with nuts and eaten with butter it forms an approxi- 
mately complete food. Many persons are found today 
using the same arguments against patent flour that 
were used when winter wheat was the only white bread 
flour milled. 

Those objections do not obtain against the bread 
flour of today. We have in the Northern spring wheat 
flours all of the best food properties contained in cereals. 

Yeast in the process of fermentation breaks down 
starch cells and destroys to a very small degree some of 
the nutriment of flour. So, also, do the bleaching 
processes which have been and are the subject of much 
discussion and litigation. 

170 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

From time immemorial it has been one long effort on 
the part of generations of housewives and caterers to 
provide the whitest bread possible. That they will 
now indorse the unbleached durum flour without a 
strong campaign of education is not to be thought of. 

Durum wheat undoubtedly contains more nutritive 
elements than other wheat, but if digestive habit pre- 
vents its complete absorption into the system it ceases 
to be of nutritive value. Unless durum flour is manipu- 
lated in the latest bread machines which aerate as well 
as mix dough, it is not as satisfactory a bread flour as 
its nutritive elements would warrant, as it is so rich in 
gluten as to be dense in texture when made into bread. 
Without the machines spoken of some measure of suc- 
cess can be obtained in its manipulation by using po- 
tatoes with the yeast to start the bread. 

The yeast plant derives its best nourishment from 
starch and the potatoes supply the starch that this 
strong gluten flour is deficient in. In the average fam- 
ily there is always a demand for well baked yeast 
breads. The claim that baking powder breads are more 
wholesome than yeast breads holds good in the use of 
a phosphate baking powder which in a measure restores 
some of the phosphates which are lost to flour by the 
modern milling process. 

BAKING BREAD 

Do not hurry the baking of breads. Flour is largely 
starch and nature has made the digestion of 
raw or uncooked starch difficult. The oven heat 
should be moderate to begin the baking. It is neces- 
sary for the heat to penetrate the loaf before forming a 
crust. It is also well to know that if the loaf of yeast 
bread is not thoroughly cooked in the center so that the 
yeast germ is killed, that given the warmth and moist- 

171 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

ure of the stomach it will resume its work of fermenta- 
tion sometimes causing serious digestive inconvenience. 

Place bread in moderate oven, (280 degrees Fahr.) 
increasing the heat after the first fifteen minutes and 
decreasing it the last fifteen minutes baking, in all about 
forty-five minutes. 

Remove immediately from the pans when baked. 
Allow it to cool before placing in bread cabinet. 

WHITE BREAD 

(With Compressed Yeast) 
MATERIALS: 

3 quarts flour (wanned Pinch of soda 

and sifted 1 pint milk 

1 pint boiling water 1 cake yeast dissolved in J4 
1 tablespoon salt cup water 

1 heaping tablespoon lard 2 tablespoons sugar 

or butterine 

PREPARATICXN : 

Pour the boiling water into the milk and add the 
sugar and one-third of the flour. By the time the flour 
is well beaten in the temperature will be right for the 
dissolved yeast. Add it and beat well, set in warm place 
for half an hour, then add the remainder of the flour 
with the soda, shortening and salt. Knead stiff and set 
away till doubled in bulk. 

It may be kneaded once more before forming into 
loaves. There is a little more satisfaction in individual 
loaves rather than in several loaves baked in one pan. 

This recipe makes four or five loaves. 

If one cup of flour is scalded and added to the sponge 
the bread will be ready for the oven in less time. 
Mashed potato has the same effect. 

172

hours. 

ENGLISH MUFFINS 
(Emergency Bread) 

The origin of the English muffin dates back to the 
period before the advent into the home of ovens or con- 
venient baking appliances as we now have. 

The open fireplace furnished the only cooking con- 
venience in most houses. In fact a generation or two 
ago very few had the brick ovens which were unwieldy 
at best for a small baking, and the custom was to carry 
the breads to the baker's to have them baked. 

Therefore the muffin which could be put over the 
fireplace to bake was quite a common article. 

They are baked in rings about four and one-half 
inches in diameter and one inch deep. The rings are 
greased and placed on a pancake griddle or in an iron 
frying pan. 

174 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

No special recipe is necessary. A very light bread 
batter is used, that is, a yeast bread batter, or soft 
dough. If the dough or batter has been disturbed so 
as to lose some of its lightness, allow the pan to set 
awhile before baking. 

They may be baked in the pan over a low blaze, 
covering the pan and turning the rings when baked 
half through, or they may be put into the oven and 
baked. Time required about twenty minutes. 

TOASTED ENGLISH MUFFINS 

While the muffins are still warm they are split open 
and toasted. 

SALT-RISING BREAD 

The leavening for salt-rising bread is established by 
a process of fermentation which is set up in the flour 
and water or flour and milk. Bacteria play an important 
part in this process and the yeast plants of the air or wild 
yeast find the batter a good medium for development. 

It has been established, too, that in a surgically 
clean room it is almost impossible to produce the neces- 
sary ferment. The same batter placed in a room far 
from clean will foam up in a short time. 

Salt-rising bread requires more heat while in the 
process of fermentation and a much longer time to bake, 
than yeast breads. 

Stir two tablespoons of cornmeal into a half pint of 
water that has been heated to 130 degrees Fahr. Add 
one-half teaspoon of salt and mix well. Make this in a 
tall pitcher, cover with a dish and stand in a bowl. Sur- 
round this with water at about 160 degrees Fahr. Keep 
over night in a warm place. 

Then warm one quart of milk and to it add one tea- 
spoon of salt and sufficient warm flour to make a heavy 
batter. Add the emptyings and beat five minutes. 

175 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Cover and stand in a warm place for about two hours. 
Then add flour to make a very soft dough. Knead till 
smooth and elastic. Divide into four loaves. 

Place each in individual loaf pan, cover with a towel, 
keep in warm place. When light bake one hour in 
moderate oven. 

BAKING ROLLS 

Rolls should be placed in a rather hot oven, reducing 
the heat after ten minutes. Bake usually about twenty 
to thirty minutes. 

Remove from pans as soon as taken from the oven, 
and cover before they are entirely cooled, so as to retain 
their proper moisture. 

STANDARD ROLL DOUGH 

MATERIALS : 

2Y2 cups water or milk 6 cups flour 

or both ^2 cup shortening 

y^ cup sugar 1 cake yeast 

2 eggs 2 mashed potatoes or Yz cup 
1 tablespoon salt flour scalded 

PREPARATION : 

First make a sponge with the potatoes or scalded 
flour and the sugar, dissolved yeast and enough of the 
flour to make a stiff batter. If compressed yeast is used 
the sponge will be ready in half an hour. 

Add to the sponge the whites and one yolk of the 
eggs well beaten together with the melted shortening, 
salt and the balance of the flour. Knead well about five 
minutes, return to bowl, brush top with shortening, 
cover and set in warm, steamy place until double its 
bulk. 

The dough may be worked down again without tak- 
ing from bowl, or it may then be made into desired 
form. 

176 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

The extra egg yolk is reserved to mix with one- 
quarter cup of water or milk to brush the tops of the 
rolls before putting them in the baking oven. 

Of flour not rich in gluten more than six cups may 
be required, but care must be taken to have the roll 
dough softer than for bread. 

POPPY SEED BRAIDS 

Use Standard Roll Dough formula. 
PREPARATION: 

When ready for the pans, break off pieces of the 
dough the size of a small egg. Roll into finger width 
strips, about five inches in length. When these are 
ready, place together and begin to braid from the center, 
braid to one end, then from the center to the other end. 
Brush with shortening and place quite far apart in shal- 
low tins. 

When ready for the oven, brush with the egg mix- 
ture and sprinkle plentifully with poppy seed and then 
with powdered sugar. 

Bake according to directions for baking rolls. 

PECAN ROLLS 
MATERIALS : 

Use Roll Dough formula 
PREPARATIOiN: 

Roll out a sheet of the dough to one-half inch thick- 
ness. Brush with melted shortening and sprinkle with 
chopped pecans. Roll up as for currant rolls, moisten- 
ing the further side so that it will adhere to the roll. 
Brush the outside of the roll with shortening and cut 
into one-half inch slices. Set each on end in well 
greased shallow pans. Do not crowd but allow to 
touch. 

When light, brush with egg mixture and sprinkle 
with sugar and chopped pecans. 

Bake in moderate oven. 

177 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

RAISIN BUNS 
Make the Standard Roll dough. Roll out square as 
possible. Brush with melted shortening, sprinkle with 
seedless raisins. Roll up tightly as for jelly roll. Cut 
into inch slices. Arrange in deep, well greased dripping 
pan. When nearly doubled in bulk, place in moderate 
oven. Bake thirty minutes. 

SWEDISH TEA ROLL 
Make Standard Roll dough. Roll out one-half inch 
thick, twice as long as the width. Brush with melted 
shortening. Sprinkle with chopped nuts, and roll in a 
compact roll. Bring two ends together, and place on a 
greased pan. Then with a pair of shears make incisions 
as though for slices an inch and a half thick, cutting 
half way through. Allow to rise. Bake thirty minutes. 
Brush with a mixture of confectioners sugar and water. 

APFEL-KUCHEN 
MATERIALS : 

2^ cups water or milk 6 cups flour 

or both Yx cup shortening 

34 cup water 1 cake yeast 

2 eggs 2 mashed potatoes or "%. cup 
1 tablespoon salt flour scalded 

PREPARATION: 

First make sponge with the potatoes or scalded flour 
and the sugar, dissolved yeast and enough of the flour 
to make a stiff batter. If compressed yeast is used the 
sponge will be ready in half an hour. 

Add to the sponge the whites and one yolk of the 
eggs well beaten together with the melted shortening, 
salt and the balance of the flour. Knead well about five 
minutes, return to bowl, brush top with shortening, 
cover and set in warm steamy place until double its 
bulk. 

The dough may be worked down again without tak- 
ing from bowl. 

178 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Roll the dough out about one-half inch thick, place 
in pans, brush plentifully with butter and sprinkle 
with sugar. Core, peel and cut into slices, apples that 
are easily cooked tender. Cut the slices in halves and 
lay them closely overlapping over the dough. Sprinkle 
again with sugar and cinnamon. 

When light bake in moderate oven. 

KIRSCH-KUCHEN 
(Cherry Bread) 
Make the same as Apfel-Kuchen, using pitted cher- 
ries cut in halves instead of apples and omit the cin- 
namon. 

SHAMROCKS 
MATERIALS : 

ZYz cups water or milk 6 cups flour 

or both ^ cup shortening 

3/^ cup sugar 1 cake yeast 

2 egg whites 2 mashed potatoes or Yi cup 
1 tablespoon salt flour scalded 

PREPARATION: 

First make a sponge with the potatoes or scalded 
flour and the sugar, dissolved yeast and enough of the 
flour to make a stiff batter. If compressed yeast is used 
the sponge will be ready in half an hour. 

Add to the sponge the whites of the eggs well 
beaten and the melted shortening, salt and the balance 
of the flour. Knead well about five minutes, return to 
bowl, brush top with shortening, cover and set in 
warm, steamy place until double its bulk. 

The dough may be worked down again without tak- 
ing from bowl. 

Mold into balls of dough slightly larger than wal- 
nuts, allowing three of these to each cup of well greased 
gem pans. 

Brush the palms with melted shortening and deftly 
roll each ball of dough between the palms, dropping into 

179 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

the gem pans. Let them rise in warm, steamy place 
and before putting in the oven, brush with a mixture of 
egg yolk and water. Bake in moderate oven twenty 
minutes. 

Upon taking from the oven brush with the melted 
shortening. 

BOSTON BUTTER BUNS 

For these use the Shamrocks formula 
PREPARATION : 

Break off a large piece of the dough and roll into 
long heavy rope, cut off sizable piece for buns, flatten 
out with the hands and place a small teaspoon of butter 
in the center. Fold dough into it and shape into balls. 
Place these so they will not touch in a shallow pan. 
Let rise to double their bulk, brush with egg mixture 
and bake in moderate oven. 

When properly made they will break open in flaky 
layers. 

HOT CROSS BUNS 

Make the dough as for "Shamrocks." Make a long 
thick rope of the dough and cut off pieces as for large 
buns. 

Grease each one well and place in dripping pan close 
but not crowded. 

Set away to proof or rise; do not allow to get too 
light. 

When ready for the oven make an incision with a 
sharp knife across the top of each in form of a cross. 

Bake thirty minutes in a moderate oven. 

Immediately on removing from the oven brush with 
egg wash, sprinkle with powdered sugar and return to 
the oven for a moment. 

These buns are of English origin and it was an old 
English custom to peddle them on the streets on Ash 
Wednesday.

MEATS 

Protein as found in meat: With meat prices soar- 
ing, the thrifty housewife looks about for new ways 
to serve cheaper cuts. This is well, for the cheaper 
cuts, be it known, are as rich in nutritive value as the 
expensive cuts. The housewife among the poorer 
classes of other countries seems to come naturally by 
the principles of the conservation of the full value of 
food products, just as the earnest thinking women of 
this country are coming to realize the significance of 
this problem. 

Although a common article of diet, little is known 
about the selection, cooking and nutritive value of the 
different cuts of meat. 

As a rule, round steak is cut too thin, thereby los- 
ing much of the juice contained in it. 

Lean of meat supplies a valuable form of protein 
or muscle building food. 

The structure of meat should be well understood 
in order to make clear the science of properly conserv- 
ing the protein and gaining full food value for expendi- 
ture, and full flavor to make the dish palatable and 
tasty. 

The protein is found in large proportion in the 
muscular part of the animal. As a rule, meat must 
be cut across the grain or muscle. This peculiarity of 
structure makes the loss of protein more rapid if the 
meat is not carefully seared to prevent its loss. 

A gentle heat is necessary to break down and 
soften the tissue, but the searing process must first 
be performed, then the heat reduced until cooking is 
finished. This is an inexorable rule to be followed, 
except when making beef tea or soups. 

Meat intended for beef tea and soups requires just 
the opposite treatment to extract the juice. 

181 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

The protein of meat is similar in its property to the 
white of eggy and when subjected to intense heat co- 
agulates or hardens, making it indigestible as well as 
unpalatable. This coagulation begins at about 130 
degrees Fahr., therefore, in stewing or cooking meat 
in water, learn to maintain the cooking below the boil- 
ing or bubbling point of water, which in this altitude 
is 212 degrees. 

Meat should be simmered, not boiled. 

To the housewife who uses a gas range, the use 
of the small simmering burner for that purpose, with 
the flame turned low, is recommended. For the owner 
of a wood or coal range, it is a very easy matter to 
keep the kettle at the right point of heat on the back 
of the range. 

To prepare a pot roast, the cook formerly put the 
meat into a kettle of hot drippings, turning constantly 
until seared entirely over the surface. The principle 
was right, but not everyone cares to stand over the 
sputtering grease. A little easier way is to place meat 
in a vessel and pour over it boiling water in which a 
large spoonful of salt has boiled, as this increases the 
heat of the water. 

Boiling salted water will have a greater heat than 
boiling unsalted water. 

Oven roasts may be treated in the same way, then 
placed in hot oven for twenty minutes, later reducing 
heat and allowing to cook at the lower temperature. 

HUNGARIAN GOULASH (GULYAS) 
(A choice dish of mutton) 
MATERIALS: 

2 pounds mutton Parsley to garnish 

(cheaper cuts) 3 medium potatoes 

2 medium onions 1 green pepper 

5^ cup drippings or 1 cup rich milk or evaporated 

margarine milk reduced slightly 

Salt and paprika to season 

182 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Place the drippings in a deep stew kettle, aluminum 
preferred; slice the onions and green pepper into it 
and cook briskly for ten minutes. Then cut the meat 
into pieces about the size of an egg and cook until 
well seared over, about fifteen minutes. 

Add half a cup of hot water; cover and cook until 
tender over simmering burner or low fire, adding water 
in small quantities as necessary. 

When meat is tender, place the potatoes, which 
have been diced, on top of the meat; cover again and 
steam until tender, but not too soft. 

Then add the milk, salt and a generous seasonmg 
of the paprika. Serve garnished with minced parsley. 

The main point to remember is to keep barely 
enough water on the meat so when finally the milk 
is added there is no water remaining. That is the secret 
of the choice flavor. 

Beef or veal may be used, taking the cheaper cuts. 
But the Hungarians use mutton in making this dish, 
for which they are famous. 

MEXICAN ROUND STEAK 

Select a thick steak and hack with a sharp knife, 
working in all the flour possible. Put into hot skillet 
with half cup of drippings, turning until well seared. 
Pour over it one cup of water and a covering of to- 
matoes, a couple of medium onions minced fine, with 
a minced green pepper. Cook for about one hour. 
Season with salt and pepper ; cover with a liberal grat- 
ing of cheese and slightly brown. This method con- 
serves all of the meat juices and provides a delicious 
gravy.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PROPER METHOD OF BROILING A STEAK 
(Under Gas Broiler) 

Order your steak two inches thick. 

Heat the broiler by lighting the burner five min- 
utes before putting the steak on the rack. Prepare 
the steak by cutting away all superfluous fat, which 
has a tendency to scorch and fill the pan with drip- 
pings that in turn may catch fire. 

Place the steak as close to the flame as possible 
and sear over quickly, turning two or three times dur- 
ing the first eight or ten minutes, then reduce the heat 
and place the steak a little further away from the flame. 

In turning the steak be careful not to pierce the 
lean part of the meat with the fork, as that will release 
the juice and make the meat drier. 

Steak two inches thick requires from 10 to 20 
minutes. 

Steak an inch thick requires from 8 to 15 minutes 
to broil. Do not hurry the process after the first seven 
or eight minutes, unless your steak is very thin, in 
which case it will be finished in that time. 

When the steak to be broiled is not large enough 
to cover a considerable part of the broiler, it is a good 
plan to place a shallow biscuit or pie pan directly under 
the rack where the meat is placed, in this way retain- 
ing the juice and drippings in one place and lessening 
the liability of the drippings catching fire, at the same 
time conserving the juices for serving with the steak. 

Do not attempt to broil a round steak. Its texture 
is such that the heat draws out the juice before it is 
seared. The steaks to broil are: sirloin, tenderloin, 
porterhouse and club. 

From an exceptionally prime beef a nice two inch 
thick cut from either the shoulder or chuck or from 
the rump is suitable for broiling.

MUSHROOM SAUCE 

Prepare fresh mushrooms by scrubbing gently with 
a vegetable brush. Do not permit them to soak in 
the water but drain immediately. 

Place some drippings in a saucepan. Slice the 
stems and caps, reserving three perfect caps for gar- 
nishing. Saute all of the mushrooms about five to ten 
minutes, removing the three caps before completing 
the sauce. Blend four level tablespoons of flour to 
each pint of sauce desired, with the drippings in the 
pan, drawing the mushrooms to one side. Add stock 
or hot water and simmer until creamy. Season with 
salt and pepper and add the drippings that collect in 
the pan under the broiling steak. 

Fry three large thick slices of either apple or green 
or ripe tomatoes. Slice a stuffed olive. 

Dish the steak onto a heated platter ; pour the mush- 
room sauce around the steak. Place the three slices 
of tomato and over each slice place a mushroom cap 
and the slice of olive over the cap. 

Bring to the table piping hot. 

TO BOIL A HAM 

Get away from the old fashioned notion that a ham 
requires soaking over night. Cleanse the ham properly, 
then pour over a quantity of boiling water. Cover and 
put on the simmering burner of the gas range or on the 
back of the coal stove and cook until tender without 
allowing to boil at a gallop. The ham thus cooked will 
retain all the meat juices and can cook at a temperature 
of 175 degrees Fahr. 

If a fireless cooker is convenient, allow the kettle to 
remain on the fire fifteen minutes before placing in the 
cooker. If hot radiators are part of the cooking equip- 
ment, the fifteen minutes on the range are not neces- 
sary.

3 pounds lean beef 1 teaspoon salt 

^ pound raw ham 1 teaspoon pepper 

2 eggs well beaten 3 tablespoons milk 

3 soda crackers rolled 4 hard boiled eggs 

fine 

PREPARATION : 

Chop the beef and ham very fine, then add the salt, 
pepper and cracker crumbs, the well beaten eggs and the 
milk. Mix all these together perfectly, grease a bread 
pan thoroughly, and press half the mixture into it 
firmly. Trim each end of your hard boiled eggs so as 
to make a flat surface, then put them on top of the mix- 
ture in the bread pan, placing them in a row, end to end. 
Now pack on top the balance of your meat, pressing it 
down firmly. Cover and bake in moderate oven one 
hour. 

Serve either hot or cold in slices. 

Minced onion, garlic or green peppers or mixed 
herbs add much to the flavor. 

MEAT LOAF— No. 2 
MATERIALS: 

1 pound uncooked beef 1 cup milk 

1 pound uncooked mutton 2 eggs 

3 cups bread crumbs Seasoning to taste, add onions 

1 pound fresh lean pork or garlic, if desired 

MATERIALS : 

Put the meats through the food chopper, mix with 
the other materials, beating the eggs slightly. 

Bake thirty minutes in moderate oven. 

Care should be taken not to overcook meat loaf as 
it makes it dry. 

The most acceptable seasoning is a combination of 
sage, marjoram, sweet basil, th5mie and summer savory.

MUTTON CURRY 

MATERIALS : 

3 cups of mutton from the 2 medium onions, minced 

neck cut into inch 1 quart boiling water 

cubes 2 sprigs mint 

1 stalk celery 3 tablespoons each margaine 
Minced parsley and flour 

1 teaspoon curry powder Salt and pepper 
Boiled rice 

PREPARATION: 

Put the meat over a gentle fire to stew or simmer 
in the quart of water. When almost tender add the 
minced onion and half a dozen leaves of the mint. Re- 
move when tender and strain the liquor. 

Melt the margarine, add the curry powder, let saute 
about three minutes; add the flour and the strained 
liquor, then the seasoning. 

Cook until creamy, pour it over the meat or add 
the meat to it. Serve either in a border or around a 
mound of cooked rice. The mound is much to be pre- 
ferred, as in this way the rice does not chill and the 
meat and curry sauce is poured around it. Sprinkle 
over all the remaining minced mint and the minced 
parsley. 

BRAISED SOUP MEAT 

Select some of the cheaper cuts of meat with the 
bone included; for instance, rib end of beef or oxtail. 

The soup meat, if properly treated for soup mak- 
ing, is at its best rather tasteless for hashes, etc. 

Try this method of braising the soup meat and 
serve at the same meal at which the soup is served. 

Half an hour before dinner take the pieces of meat 
from the kettle, drain, roll in cracker meal, which has 

188 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

been seasoned with salt, paprika and pepper, place in 
a small dripping pan, surround with half a can of to- 
matoes, a small onion sliced and a green pepper minced. 
Place in a hot oven, basting frequently. To make the 
dinner complete, serve baked potatoes. The meat left 
over can be used for hash or meat pie, and has a good 
flavor. 

POT PIES 

What we know now as meat or pot pies originated 
with the meat pie covered with a suet pastry and cooked 
under water in a kettle. 

The "Cousin Jack pasties" of the Cornish miners of 
the West are also an evolution of the suet meat pie. 

Now, instead of using the suet pastry, they are made 
with shortening and baking powder and baked slowly 
in up-to-date gas range ovens. I have seen great pans 
full of these pasties in the process of preparation for the 
miners' lunch or dinner buckets. And very sensible 
they are, for they include bread, meat and vegetables all 
in one handful. I have often thought how much more 
sensible for some of these little folks* school lunches, 
rather than what is often given them. 

ENGLISH PORK PIES 
(No. 1) 

English pork pies are made in a variety of ways, the 
commonest of all is probably the individual "pasty." 

Ordinary pie pastry is used to line little patty pans. 
An easy and quick way to do this is to line one tin, after 
rolling out the paste. Then take it from the pan to use 
for a pattern and with a pastry cutter cut out as many 
as required to line the tins. With a biscuit cutter of the 
proper size, cut out tops for the pies that will just meet 
the edge all around. Stew until tender some very lean 

189 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

fresh pork, season with thyme, minced onions, salt and 
pepper. Cut the meat into small dice. Thicken the 
liquor in which the pork was cooked, add to it the diced 
meat, fill each patty tin, make two or three openings in 
the covers and put them in place. Brush with milk. 

Put them on to a baking sheet and bake about 
thirty minutes. 

ENGLISH PORK PIES 
(No. 2) 

Take finger length strips of lean fresh pork, roll 
them in flour and saute in very little of the fat, trimmed 
from the pork. Line a very deep pie tin or a pudding 
dish with pastry. Put in a layer of pork, season with 
salt, pepper and mace. Then a layer of sliced tart 
apples. 

Have prepared some sugar and flour mixed in the 
proportion of one heaping tablespoon of flour to one of 
sugar. Sprinkle some of this over the apples with a 
dusting of nutmeg. 

Fill up the dish with alternate layers. Pour in suffi- 
cient cider to moisten the contents. Dot with butter 
and put the top pastry in place. Brush with milk. 

Bake from thirty to forty-five minutes in a moderate 
oven. 

PAPRIKA SCHNITZEL 

To make this procure one round of thick veal steak. 
Cut it into finger length strips and about an inch thick. 
Place in the frying pan about three tablespoons of oil 
or two or three slices of salt pork. Roll the strips of 
veal in flour and saute them in the fat or oil. Remove 
the meat and add a tablespoon of flour, and -when well 
mixed pour in the strained juice from a can of tomatoes 
and add a small onion minced, a pinch of mace. 

190 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Return the meat to the pan, cover closely, and sim- 
mer gently for three-quarters of an hour. When done 
remove the meat, season the sauce with salt and a gen- 
erous dash of paprika. 

Place the meat on a hot platter and strain the sauce 
over it. 

PORK CHEESE 
(Italian) 

MATERIALS: 

1 pound fresh pork Seasoning of salt, pepper, 

4 mushrooms, chopped minced parsley and thyme 

Nutmeg, grated 

PREPARATION: 

Chop the pork rather coarsely and mix mushrooms 
and seasoning with it. Put into small well greased 
mold and bake in slow oven. 

When cold serve in slices. 

FRICATELLI 

MATERIALS : 

1 pound fresh pork 1 small onion, minced fine 

Bread crumbs Salt, sage and pepper to 

season 

PREPARATION: 

Run the meat through the food grinder, mix with 
seasoning and bread crumbs to form little pats. Pan- 
broil on hot griddle, with plenty of drippings. Serve 
hot. 

SAUSAGE RISSOLES 

MATERIALS : 

Yt. pound sausage meat Flour, salt 

Mashed potatoes 

191 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Mix the mashed potatoes with flour so that they can 
be rolled out. 

Roll one-half inch thick and cut with large biscuit 
cutter. Place in layer of the sausage, fold over and 
pinch edges together. Fry in hot fat till a nice golden 
brown. 

NEAPOLITAN BEEF 

Neapolitan beef provides a delectable dish from a 
left over beef or broiled steak. The rarer the roast or 
steak, the better. Cut into dice about two cups full, put 
three tablespoons of oil or drippings into the frying 
pan and turn in the beef. Stir until slightly browned. 
Then add one minced onion, half a dozen cloves, a few 
celery seed, a sprinkle of dried thyme and a teaspoon of 
dried or fresh minced parsley. Add a cup and a half of 
soup stock or gravy. Simmer fifteen minutes, then add 
a wine glass of white wine. Serve this with some 
freshly boiled rice. 

BROILED TRIPE 

Cut the tripe in pieces for serving, brush these with 
olive oil or melted butter, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
and roll in cracker meal or bread crumbs. 

Put them into a shallow pan under the broiler fire, 
turning constantly until browned lightly. Spread with 
maitre d'hotel butter or with tomato sauce. 

CURRIED TRIPE 

Cook an onion, cut in rings, in one-quarter cup of 
drippings or shortening until yellow and softened, add 
one level teaspoon of curry powder, saute and add a 
dash of paprika, salt and two level tablespoons flour. 
When these are well blended with the drippings add a 
cup of white stock and a cup of milk, or in the absence 

192 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

of the stock use two cups of milk, and cook till smooth. 
Cut the tripe into small pieces to serve and add them 
to the curry. Let stand over hot water. Finish with a 
tablespoon or two of lemon juice. 

Curry powder must always be sauted in oil or butter 
before adding it to any dish. This brings out or de- 
velops the right seasoning quality. 

CREAMED SWEETBREADS 

MATERIALS : 

1 pair sweetbreads 1 pint cream sauce, No. 1 

1 sliced onion Salt and pepper to season 

PREPARATION: 

Blanch the sweetbreads by placing for thirty min- 
utes in cold water. Then drop into boiling salted water 
and simmer one-half hour. Drop into cold water to 
blanch or place under cold water faucet. Cut into small 
pieces, discarding all dark tissues and membranes. 
Have the cream sauce hot and add the sweetbreads to 
it. The slice of onion may be put in the milk in mak- 
ing the cream sauce. 

When the sweetbreads and cream sauce are com- 
bined, season with salt and pepper and serve in pate 
shells, or timbale cases. 

CROWN ROAST OF LAMB 

This crown of lamb or mutton seems to naturally 
fit in to the meat course in an Easter menu. Procure 
from the meat market the rack of lamb or mutton, with 
the chops split apart at the base, but not detached. 
The chops are then trimmed or "frenched," and the meat 
trimmed away is rolled down to the eye of tender meat. 

The rack is split apart down the line of the back- 
bone and the two divisions are fastened together at the 

193 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

ends, with the chops out, to form a circle. Pin brown 
paper over the exposed ends of the chop bones or ribs, 
so that they will not become too brown in the oven. 
Tie or truss each bone so as to keep the rib bones uni- 
formly apart, one from the other. 

Put the roast thus prepared into a dripping pan and 
into a hot oven for about twenty minutes. In addition 
to the brown paper covering for the ends of the bones, 
invert a large granite saucepan over the roast, allow- 
ing it to rest on the chop ends. After it has been in the 
hot oven twenty minutes, season it with salt and pep- 
per, add a little hot water and roast about an hour at 
a reduced heat. 

When cooked, fill the crown with steamed brussels 
sprouts, dressed with butter, salt and pepper. Place 
French chop frills on each chop bone. Serve with a 
mint or caper sauce in sauce boat. 

BRAISED TONGUE (Cider Sauce) 

MATERIALS: 

Tongue, either smoked or ^ dozen each cloves, all- 
pickled in brine spice and bay leaf or two 
1 pint cider, wine, cham- Cracker meal to which a little 
pagne or sherry flour has been added and 

seasoned with salt and 
pepper. 

PREPARATION: 

If the tongue is smoked, soak it for several hours in 
cold water. Cook in water to cover without rapid boil- 
ing until tender, having put the cloves, allspice and bay 
leaf in the water. Remove from the water when tender, 
dash cold water over it and remove the skin. 

Roll or coat with the cracker meal, place in dripping 
pan and add the cider and some of the liquor in which 
the tongue was cooked. 

194 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Baste often with the cider. A little brown sugar 
will add to the flavor if sprinkled over the tongue while 
in the oven. Time in oven, about one-half to three- 
quarters of an hour. 

If, when taken from the oven, the cider is not creamy 
for the sauce, a little thickening may be added, but do 
not have sauce thick. Two or three minced gherkins 
add piquancy to the sauce for some tastes. 



SWEETBREADS CREOLE 



MATERIALS ; 



1 pound sweetbreads 2 tablespoons of flour 

(2 pairs) 1 egg 

2 oranges 1 green pepper 

1 lemon Salt, pepper and paprika to 
"%. cup butter season, parsley 

1 cup boiling water 



PREPARATION: 

Select nice, fresh sweetbreads. If you cannot trust 
your meat man, examine them to ascertain that they 
are perfectly sweet. Blanch in cold water for fifteen 
minutes, then drop into boiling salted water and sim- 
mer one-half an hour. Put into cold water, then drain 
and with a sharp knife remove all fat and membrane, 
but do not cut into very small pieces. Sprinkle them 
with the juice of one orange and place in the refrigera- 
tor for two hours. Then place in saucepan, dredge with 
flour, season with salt and pepper, dot with pieces of 
butter and pour over one-half cup of boiling water. 
Then add the orange juice in which the sweetbreads 
were marinaded and the green pepper minced. Place 
in the oven till nicely browned, basting them frequently. 
Serve with Cuban Gravy. 

195 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

CUBAN GRAVY 

Cream one-half cup butter. Mix one-quarter tea- 
spoon salt, one-eighth teaspoon paprika, the juice of 
one-half orange, juice of one lemon, one-half cup boil- 
ing water. To this add one egg, well beaten and cook 
in double boiler until thick and smooth. Add the 
creamed butter, pour around sweetbreads and serve, 
after garnishing with parsley and slices of orange. 

SWEETBREADS A LA KING 

MATERIALS : 

1 pair sweetbreads % cup brown sherry 

3 egg yolks Salt and dash of paprika to 

3 level tablespoons butter season highly 

1 cup cream 

PREPARATION : 

Prepare and parboil the sweetbreads as directed for 
scrambled sweetbreads. Cut into small pieces. 

Place the butter in a saucepan, when heated, drop 
in the sweetbreads and toss in the butter till well 
heated through then add the sherry and simmer. 

Beat the egg yolks into the cream, pour into sauce- 
pan and allow the mixture to heat slowly, then add the 
seasoning. 

Serve on points of toast which have been dipped in 
minced parsley. 

SCRAMBLED SWEETBREADS 

Blanch a pair of sweetbreads by dropping into cold 
water for one-half an hour. Cook them thirty minutes 
in boiling salted water. Remove from the water and 
allow cold water to run over them for a few minutes. 
Pick them to pieces, discarding all strings or mem- 
branes. 

196 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Break six eggs and separate the whites from the 
yolks. Just beat the yolks enough to mix with six 
tablespoons of water and seasoning of salt and pepper. 
Add the yolks and sweetbreads to the egg whites and 
place the pan over a dish of boiling water or turn the 
mixture back and forth, but do not over cook. Turn 
onto a warm platter and garnish with minced green pep- 
pers or parsley. 

ROAST CHICKEN 

If the roasting pan is small and the chicken large 
you will succeed very well with it, but the pan must 
not be much too large or the flesh of the fowl will not be 
kept moist. Long before the double roasting pans were 
thought of, iron kettles were used to roast chickens in. 
The fowl was prepared and placed in the iron kettle, and 
covered closely and put into a hot oven. 

Another very old-fashioned method of preparing a 
chicken for roasting is to make a soft dough of flour, a 
little baking powder and water. Roll this about a 
quarter inch thick and blanket the fowl completely. 
This forms a coat of armor that prevents the juices from 
drying up in the baking, and while I do not personally 
recommend that method, there are many very excellent 
cooks who considered it the very best method. 

The covered casseroles of stoneware, or stone milk 
crocks, are ideal vessels in which to roast small fowl. 
In fact nothing can equal them unless it is the fireless 
cooker with the heated plates. 

Only ordinary precaution is necessary in not sud- 
denly exposing the casseroles to extremes of heat or 
cold. Putting them into a very hot oven would not 
break them, but pouring cold water on them when 
heated, would. 

197 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Dress, clean, truss and stuff the chicken. Dust with 
flour, salt and pepper to season. If the fowl is not fat, 
lay strips of nice salt pork over it, and keep them in 
place with toothpicks. This is preferable to attempting 
to lard it, and answers the purpose of keeping the sur- 
face basted. A four pound chicken requires about two 
hours in a casserole, or tightly covered crock in a hot 
oven. 

BREAD STUFFING FOR CHICKEN 

Crumble day old bread, free from crust, or grate in 
a coarse grater. 

Mince very fine or put through a food chopper two 
green peppers and two medium onions. Season the 
bread crumbs with pepper, salt, sage or thyme as de- 
sired. Add a heaping teaspoon of butter distributed in 
small pieces through the dressing. Moisten with a 
sprinkle of water, not enough to make a clammy, sod- 
den mass, not even enough to hold the ingredients to- 
gether. Day old bread requires very little water, some- 
times none. 

CHICKEN A LA KING 

MATERIALS : 

2 cupfuls chicken, cooked ^ green pepper, stripped 

1 cupful milk 2 egg yolks 

34 cupful Sherry wine 4 level tablespoonfuls butter 

Yz cupful mushrooms Seasoning of salt and paprika 
1 red pepper 

PREPARATION : 

Cut the cold cooked chicken in strips. Put the but- 
ter into the saucepan and add the mushrooms. If fresh 
mushrooms, cook 10 minutes, if canned variety, cook 
five minutes. Blend the flour with the butter and mush- 
rooms, add the peppers cut in strips. 

198 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Stir the egg yolk with the milk. Add the Sherry 
to the sauce pan and when heated stir in the milk and 
egg mixture. 

Cook until creamy, then remove from the fire and 
keep hot. Add seasoning of salt and paprika. 

CHILI CON CARNE 
(Pepper with Meat) 

MATERIALS: 

2 pounds round or lean % cup margarine or beef drip- 
chuck steak or mutton pings 

2 pimientoes or large Chili % can tomatoes 

peppers 1 large onion 

2 cups rice or spaghetti Garlic, salt and pepper or 
(cooked) Creole seasoning 

PREPARATION : 

Trim meat free from fat and gristle ; cut into cubes 
size of an egg; roll them in flour. Place a stew pan 
over the fire and put into it the drippings and onion 
and when hot turn in the meat and brown, then the 
tomatoes and sliced pimientoes and cook until meat is 
tender. Make a border of the cooked rice or spaghetti 
either on a chop plate or platter. Serve the chili con 
carne in this border. Garnish by placing half slices of 
lemon and rings of pimientoes, alternately, around the 
border of rice. 



BAKED HAM SUPREME 

(Madeira Sauce) 

MATERIALS: 

1 medium sized lean ham % dozen allspice 

1 pint wine Bay leaves 

Handful of cloves Cracker meal and flour 

199 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Cleanse the ham thoroughly with a vegetable brush 
and soda, rinse every particle of the soda from the ham. 
Plunge into boiling water for five minutes, then take 
from this water and put over to cook in water about 
175 degrees Fahr., and maintain that temperature for 
about five hours. Throw the allspice and about one- 
half dozen cloves and bay leaves into the water. Re- 
move and without allowing the ham to cool, take off the 
skin and all but a thin strip of the fat. With a thin 
bladed knife take off the smoked surface of the lean 
part. Make a paste of cracker meal and flour in equal 
proportions and some fat skimmed from the kettle, and 
cover the surface of the ham with it. Stick the remain- 
ing cloves in the ham. Place in a hot oven with the 
wine or cider, and a cup of the liquor from the kettle. 
Baste frequently and bake until browned all over. 

A dash of Harvey and tomato sauce, and just before 
serving, a heaping teaspoon of flour creamed with some 
of the fat from the kettle, completes a delicious sauce. 
Champagne, brown sherry, cider or grape juice, may be 
used. Bring to the table in a large platter in a bed of 
water cress and sprinkled with minced parsley. Trim 
the meat from the end bone, decorate the bone with a 
quill of paper, or tie a bunch of parsley around it. 

BRAWN 
MATERIALS : 

3 pounds fresh veal Seasoning of salt, pepper and 

2 pounds fresh pork sage, marjoram and thyme 

PREPARATION : 

Select the cheaper cut of veal stewing meat, the same 
of pork, with as little fat as possible. Put into stew 
kettle with water to barely cover and cook until tender. 
Do not boil to pieces. 

800 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

When cooked, drain from the kettle, take out the 
bones and chop rather coarse. Add seasoning. 

Return to the liquor and cook up once, then dish into 
a cheese cloth sack, set this into a bowl or dish, place a 
pan or plate on top of it, and heavy weights to press. 
Three of the ordinary flat irons will give sufficient 
weight to compress. This may be, when cold, kept in 
a jar of slightly salted water and kept a week or two. Is 
delicious sliced cold, or may be warmed over. 

BRUNSWICK STEW 

This stew is the chef d'oeuvre of an out-of-door 
feast and the capsheaf of good eating. 

Its making does not require a dainty housewife in a 
white apron before a twentieth century gas range. A 
camp fire and kettles and perhaps a chopping bowl 
completes all the equipment necessary. No special 
culinary ability is required, nothing but a discrimina- 
tion in seasoning, that is left solely to the genius and 
judgment of the cook. And is there a man to be found, 
who does not think he can season a dish just a little bet- 
ter than any woman that ever lived? 

MATERIALS : 

A four or five pound Butter 

chicken 2 cups milk 

2 pounds veal Salt and pepper to taste 

2 quarts tomatoes Fresh corn and tomatoes 
1 quart corn may be used 

PREPARATION: 

Green corn is much to be preferred. The kernels 
must be scored and the ears scraped. Green peppers 
and a pint of okra are desirable additions. 

Singe, draw and cut up the chicken at the joints. 
Cover with water and stew till tender, then take the 
meat from the bones and with the giblets and liver chop 

201 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

very fine. Return it to the kettle and add all of the in- 
gredients except the milk. Cook well and add a pinch 
of soda. Then add the boiling milk. 

HOT TAMALES 

When the hostess is weary of sandwiches and her 
ingenuity is taxed, let her surprise and please her folks 
with tamales, hot or cold. Almost any meat may be 
used, meat that is not fat, mutton or veal or both are 
better than beef, but of course chicken leads them all. 
With a little calculation there is very little work in- 
volved. 

The reports of the lengthy process of making them 
in Mexico leads one to suppose that the process is very 
elaborate. The Mexicans have to grind the corn to 
make the meal in the most primitive fashion. They use 
what is called a "metata" to grind the paste after hav- 
ing soaked the dried yellow corn in lime water. This 
is tedious and does not result in a tamale of any better 
quality than when made of cornmeal. The only diffi- 
culty may be in obtaining the corn husks. But if im- 
possible to secure them, take instead six-inch squares 
of cheese cloth. The husks are much to be preferred, 
yet in their absence the cheese cloth will answer. 

I would suggest a large chicken or chickens. Re- 
serve the breast meat for club sandwiches and use the 
dark meat for the tamales. Split the chicken down the 
back after singeing it. Draw and cleanse it. Without 
dismembering the fowl put it with the liver, heart and 
giblets into water to barely cover it. If it is an old hen 
add a little vinegar to the water. Place it over a slow 
fire so that it will cook at a temperature below the boil- 
ing point. When tender remove from the kettle and 
allow to cool sufficiently to handle. 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Disjoint and cut all pieces into inch cubes as nearly 
as possible. If there is not sufficient oil from the 
chicken put a heaping tablespoon of butter into a sauce- 
pan with a medium sized onion, minced fine, and red 
peppers to season. Add a rounding tablespoon of flour 
and then pour in about three cups of the chicken broth, 
cook till creamy, season with salt, pepper and paprika. 
Add the chicken and take from the fire. Do not cook 
the chicken too much as it must not be stringy. 

While the chicken is cooking scald the corn husks 
and boil for one-half hour. Then rinse in cold water. 
Cut off the extreme tapering tips and cut the leaves 
from the stalks. This is better accomplished with the 
shears. Cook three cups of cornmeal thoroughly and 
add a dash of salt, as for mush. 

Place two broad leaves close together and parallel, 
and where they join place another, to make a close cov- 
ering for the tamale filling. Spread the cornmeal paste 
or mush about a quarter to half an inch thick. Put a 
couple of spoonfuls of the chicken with the gravy on 
this paste, and put a stuffed olive and a couple of seeded 
raisins in each one. Gather the ends of the husks and 
fold over the contents, lapping the layer of paste and 
the husks. Tie each end securely. Place all in a 
steamer, cover closely and cook one hour. 

They may be eaten cold or reheated by steaming. 

To serve, place them on a platter, snip the strings 
and serve them as they are. Each person can unfold 
and lay aside the husks. The canned pimento may be 
used in place of either olives or raisins. The Mexicans 
often mix lard or suet with the cornmeal in making the 
paste. 

Should corn husks be out of the question, and 
small squares of cheese cloth substituted, lay on the 

203 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

paste about one-half inch thick, and when ready to 
serve remove the wrapping. If the tamale is to be eaten 
cold, roll it in a leaf of lettuce. 

A tamale or two with a green vegetable salad and 
some thin buttered rye bread makes a most substantial 
luncheon. 

CHICKEN CREOLE 

MATERIALS : 

1 chicken 4 medium potatoes 

3 tablespoons oil 3 egg yolks 

1 onion 1 teaspoon salt 

1 can tomatoes 1 teaspoon Creole 

2 red chili peppers ^ teaspoon pepper 
Flour Creole seasoning 
Bay leaf 

PREPARATION: 

Prepare a tender chicken as for fricassee by separat- 
ing at the joints, cutting each part of the leg in two. Cut 
the breast in halves lengthwise and then each half in 
three pieces. Put three tablespoons of oil into a kettle, 
add one large onion cut fine and two red chilis. Stir 
and cook for ten minutes. Roll each piece of chicken in 
flour and brown in the oil. Pour one can of tomatoes 
and sufficient water to cover the chicken into the kettle, 
add a bay leaf and cook till tender, about one hour. 

Pare four medium potatoes, cut them into dice, add 
them to the chicken and cook till tender, but not broken. 
Boil another potato in another saucepan and put it 
through a puree sieve, add to it while hot the yolks of 
three eggs, one tablespoon of vinegar, a level teaspoon 
of salt, one quarter teaspoon pepper, and Creole season- 
ing. Place this in a hot tureen. Pour over it the con- 
tents of the kettle, and send to the table. This takes the 
place of both soup and meat. 

204 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Instead of the potatoes, plain boiled rice may be 
served, making a mound of rice in the center of the 
tureen. 

CHICKEN CHILI 
MATERIALS : 

1 small chicken 1 medium onion 

5 medium tomatoes 1 can red kidney beans 

2 red or green chili y^ pound salt pork 

peppers 

PREPARATION: 

Singe and wipe the fowl clean. Split down the back 
and cleanse it well. Unjoint and cut away the breast 
meat in large pieces. Break the half of each half of the 
back in two pieces and the neck into sections. Divide 
each joint of the legs in two pieces. 

Cut the pork into cubes and put into a fry pan. 
Saute until lightly browned then turn in the chicken, 
after rolling in flour, and brown. When brown add the 
chili pepper and onion minced fine. Stir around for a 
minute or two and add the tomatoes and one cup of 
hot water. 

Simmer gently until tender. 

Put the contents of the can of beans into a wire 
strainer and drain off the liquor which may be reserved 
for soup stock. 

Before removing the chicken from the fire add the 
beans with pepper and salt to taste. 

If the chili pepper is not quite hot enough use more 
than one-half of one or use the prepared chili powder, 
or Creole seasoning. 

MEXICAN CHILI 
MATERIALS : 

2 pounds uncooked lean Yz can tomatoes 

meat (cheaper cuts) 2 red Chili peppers 
y^ cup drippings or Bay leaf 

margarine Flour 

1 large onion Salt and pepper to season 

205 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Put the drippings into a saucepan. Roll the meat, 
which has been diced, in the flour, and fry or saute in 
the drippings, until each piece is browned all over. 

Draw the meat to one side of the dish and put the 
onion and peppers into the drippings to cook for a mo- 
ment. Add all of the other materials, and cook over low 
flame until the meat is tender. 

This is an excellent dish cooked in the fireless cooker. 
If the oven is being used, this dish may be put into a 
casserole or butter jar, and completed in the oven. 

Cold cooked left over or soup meat may be used in 
which case thirty to forty minutes only will be required. 

CHILI CON CARNE 



MATERIALS: 




2 pounds round or chuck 


1 green pepper 


steak 


Yz can tomatoes 


Yz cup margarine or beef 


1 medium onion 


drippings 


1 cup rice or spaghetti 


Yz kidney beans 


(cooked) 


1 pimento or large chili 


Garlic, salt and pepper or 


pepper 


Creole seasoning 



PREPARATION : 

Trim steak free from fat and gristle, cut into cubes 
the size of an t,%^, roll them in flour. Place a stew pan 
over the fire and put into it the drippings, and when hot 
turn in the meat and brown, do not allow it to stew. 

Then add the onion, garlic, pimento and pepper. 
Saute a few moments. 

Turn in the tomatoes and cook slowly until the meat 
is tender. Then add the Creole seasoning and salt to 
taste. Add the kidney beans so as to have them heated 
through, but do not cook the beans or they will become 
mushy. 

Place the cooked rice or spaghetti in border on one 
side of the serving platter. Dish the chili. 

206 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Garnish the rice with rings of pimento. Spaghetti 
may be substituted for the kidney beans. When 
spaghetti, egg noodles, or any of the Italian pastes take 
the place of the kidney beans, the rice may be omitted. 
Mutton, veal or fresh pork which is not too fat may be 
used in preference to the beef.

SAUCES FOR MEAT AND FISH 

MEAT AND FISH SAUCES AND GRAVIES 

Meats and fish require sauces and gravies to con- 
form to their variety. 

With beef and mutton we desire a gravy that has a 
strong flavor of the meat, which is distinctive. With 
fowl and with veal we require milk in most cases in 
making the gravies complete. 

Fish as a rule are served with a sauce containing no 
fishy flavor and are more often made with a "soupcon" 
of acid, either lemon juice or vinegar. 

A cream sauce or "roux" is the base for the fish 
sauces. For the city dweller it will be found that the 
unsweetened evaporated milks are most excellent, and 
many who can conveniently provide themselves with the 
fresh cows' milk, prefer a good brand of the canned 
article, for their cream sauces and cream soups or 
purees. 

Cream sauces are made in four different ways, any 
one of which may be used to suit the occasion. In two 
of the methods butterine or butter and flour are used in 
equal quantities, and creamed before adding to the hot 
milk, or adding the milk to the butter and flour. 

In the third method the butter or margarine may 
be omitted or half the usual quantity taken. 

The other sauce, accompaniment for meat, or in un- 
usual cases, for fish, has for its base the "Espagnole" 
or brown sauce, a grand stock sauce. 

At best, where a quantity of gravy is desired and the 
juices of the meat are properly conserved in cooking, 
there is not enough of the natural juices to properly 
season any ordinary quantity of gravy. To assist this 

209 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

we use caramelized sugar, an expedient that had its 
origin in antiquity but yet is seldom known to the lay- 
cook. 

Browned flour has been resorted to but does not ful- 
fill the want. 

CARAMEL 

MATERIALS : 

Y-z cup granulated sugar Water to merely dissolve 
Yi cup hot water sugar 

PREPARATION : 

Place the sugar with the water to dissolve it in a 
shallow steel or aluminum fry pan of small size for 
this quantity of sugar. Cook to syrup and allow to 
slowly brown a deep color evenly, to the point of almost 
burning, taking care to avoid burning and remember- 
ing also that the syrup will continue to brown after re- 
moval from the fire, due to the heat of the vessel. 

When cooled slightly to avoid excessive bubbling, 
add the cup of hot water and return to gentle heat until 
syrup is dissolved. 

It is then ready for immediate use or may be placed 
in a wide necked bottle. 

This caramel is used for both flavor and color for 
sauces, gravies, soups, custards, whipped creams and 
ices. 

SUBSTITUTE CAPER SAUCE 

An excellent substitute for capers and an easily 
prepared relish may be made by cutting small cucumber 
pickles into tiny cubes, with a sharp knife, and stirring 
into hot drawn butter. 

Eat with fish or chops. 

210 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 



SAUCE TARTARE 

This is made by adding two olives, one gherkin, 
one tablespoon capers, and one of parsley chopped fine, 
to half a cup of mayonnaise dressing. 



MINT SAUCE 

Pick the leaves from a well-cleaned bunch of mint. 
Chop very fine and pour over them one-quarter cup boil- 
ing water. Add two teaspoons (level) of sugar, cover 
closely, and let stand in cool place one-half an hour. 
Then add a dash of paprika, one-quarter teaspoon salt 
and three tablespoons vinegar. 



ESPAGNOLE— Brown Sauce 

The base for the Espagnole may be furnished by the 
meat in preparation. For instance, with any roast the 
flour may be mixed in the pan containing the drippings, 
and the liquor from the meat may be used, or water in 
case there is no such liquor. Then add, with other sea- 
soning, enough of the caramel, see page 210, for sea- 
soning and color. 

An excellent seasoning is given any gravy or sauce, 
by sauteing a few thin slices of onion or green pepper 
in a little oil or butter and then adding the flour and 
other materials and seasonings. 

ROE SAUCE 
MATERIALS: 

1 set shad roe ^ teaspoon ground mace 

Yi. cup butter or drippings 6 tablespoons madeira 
1 teaspoon onion juice Salt to season 

211

1 tablespoon granulated 2 level tablespoons flour 
sugar Salt and pepper 

PREPARATION: 

Clean and prepare the mushrooms by slicing about 
one-quarter inch thick. Saute in the butter, or better 
in olive oil. Into another saucepan throw the granu- 
lated sugar and place where it will caramelize, adding 
one pint boiling water. Stir into the mushrooms the 
flour and add the boiling caramel. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. 

Pour over and around a steak on a warm platter. 
Garnish with rounds of green peppers or minced 
parsley.

Cream together one heaping teaspoon each of flour 
and butter. Pour over three-quarter cup of hot water. 
Cook till creamy and add one-half cup prepared horse- 
radish or heaping tablespoon freshly grated horseradish 
and juice of half a lemon. 

APPLE SAUCE WITH HORSERADISH 

(A Relish with Roast Pork) 
Many do not know that a well made sauce of dried 
apples is often preferred to the sauce of fresh apples as 
a relish to roast pork, duck or goose, also that a heap- 
ing tablespoon of horseradish drained from the vinegar 
and added to one cup of either kind of apple sauce will 
give a decided relish that is good. 

GOLDEN ROD SAUCE 
(To serve with Creamed Dried Beef) 
MATERIALS :

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

CREOLE SAUCES 

There is a wide latitude in the making of Creole 
sauces. The popular conception of a sauce Creole seems 
to be a sauce, the predominating feature of which is 
pepper and resembling our tomato sauces, but with a 
much higher flavor and seasoning. 

But there are Creole sauces made with the juice of 
oranges and lemons and seasoned with pepper, parsley, 
etc. 

In the making of the former sauce, different peppers 
are used, the chili (pronounced shee-lee) pepper is the 
proper one to use, as it has a distinctive property of 
seasoning without the intense burning sensation. 
Many, particularly those who cater to the public, think 
a Creole sauce should be seasoned so highly that it will 
destroy all sense of flavor, but this should be avoided, 
both from a dietetic and gastronomic viewpoint. 

Chili con carne, for instance, as served in public 
places, is seasoned so heavily with cayenne or paprika 
as to destroy all flavor of the other ingredients, thus 
depriving the dish of its most inviting quality. 

Tomatoes, garlic, chili peppers, Creole seasoning 
and onion form the base of most Creole sauces, the 
proportions and ingredients varying according to in- 
dividual tastes and materials on hand. 

Creole seasoning is a preparation of New Orleans 
origin and is put up in powdered form. 

Chili peppers may be obtained in cans under the 
Spanish name of pimientoes and these cans are in two 
sizes, usually at a shilling for the small and twenty-five 
cents for the larger size. These pimientoes are more 
convenient for the housewife, as they are ready for 
use. 

The dried chili peppers are somewhat hotter and are 
a nuisance to prepare when pressed for time. Chilis 

215 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

may be prepared in a quantity and dried again, and are 
more economical. The chili powder of commerce does 
not quite fill the place of the home-prepared chili. To 
prepare the dried chilis, stew them until tender and 
then rub through a sieve to remove the tough skin and 
seeds, or drop into cold water after stewing and then 
cut in halves, removing the seed veins and scrape off 
the softened pulp. When the peppers are dry they do 
not seem to have very much pulp but after cooking 
there will be as much as in a medium tomato. 

Either an oil, olive or cotton seed, or a dripping 
used to saute (fry in shallow fat). The onion, is the 
first move in the making of a Creole sauce, but always 
remember that to properly bring out the right flavor, 
the onion, must like the mushroom, be first sauted. 
Mushrooms may be included in a Creole sauce, also 
green peppers. Tomatoes, fresh or canned, are always 
included. A slight thickening of flour creamed with 
drippings or butter is often desirable. There, of course, 
can be no hard and fast rule for this sauce, but follow- 
ing is a recipe in which the proper formula is presented 
and must be adhered to through the various changes of 
individual preference or expediency. 

CREOLE SAUCE 

MATERIALS: 

1 medium onion 2 teaspoons oil or butter 

1 clove, garlic Bay leaf, whole allspice, 

1 pepper, red or green mace or cloves for sea- 

2 cups tomato soning 

PREPARATION : 

Place the butter in saucepan, add minced onions and 
pepper; saute five minutes, turn in the tomatoes and 
seasoning and cook twenty minutes. 

A sauce Creole is very seldom strained and various 
combinations of seasoning go into its makeup. To 

216 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

make the dish more peppery, a dash of cayenne, paprika 
or tobasco sauce may be added. If mushrooms are de- 
sired add these whether bottled or fresh to the onions 
and saute with them. 

SAUCE A LA BUCKINGHAM 

Put one cup of sweet milk into a double boiler. 
Cream one rounding tablespoon of flour with an equal 
quantity of butter, add this to the hot milk and cook 
until thick. Mince small Gherkin pickles, one green 
pepper, sliced stuffed olives and some parsley and add 
to the cream sauce. Lay some rounds of lettuce leaves 
on a small platter, heap the sauce in the center. Stick 
two or three sprigs of parsley into the mound. This 
should be served from the side with fish. 

GREEN PEPPER SAUCE 

Select four large peppers, throw them into boiling 
water, boil rapidly fifteen minutes, drain, remove the 
thin skin, cut in halves and take out the ends. Chop 
fine and put into a saucepan of boiling water again, 
slightly salted. Cook till tender. Drain and press 
through a colander, return them to the saucepan, add 
a tablespoon of butter creamed with one-half table- 
spoon of flour and four tablespoons of cream. Cook till 
creamy. 

Use no more water than necessary in boiling the 
peppers. Serve this puree of pepper with any dishes of 
fish or meat loaf. 

SAUCE HOLLANDAISE 

MATERIALS : 

2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon flour 

Yolks of 2 eggs Salt and pepper to season

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Put the bay leaf and onion in the vinegar, bring to 
the boiling point and cool. Cream the butter and flour 
together, add gradually the water, stir until boiling, 
add the vinegar, strained. Take from the fire, stir in 
gradually the yolks of the eggs. Heat very gently just 
a moment, add the seasoning of salt and pepper and 
strain at once into a sauce boat. 

This is one of the most elegant of the fish sauces. 
Lemon juice may be used in place of vinegar. 

DRAWN BUTTER, Unsweetened 

Explanatory: — This sauce forms the base for many 
seasonings and is then called by name of the seasoning 
or addition. 

MATERIALS : 

1 cup hot water 2 level tablespoons soft butter 

2 level tablespoons flour Salt and pepper to season 
PREPARATION : 

Heat the water in a small saucepan, cream the butter 
and flour and stir into the hot water until creamy. Add 
seasoning.

vinegar and the addition of butter the size of a walnut 
just before serving. 

HORSERADISH SAUCE 

This may be Drawn Butter with a goodly addition 
of plain grated or bottled horseradish. 

218 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 



CHEESE SAUCE, To Serve with Fish 

Use the Drawn Butter recipe with a very strong 
grated cheese and seasoning of paprika. 

DRAWN BUTTER, Sweetened 

Explanatory: — When sweetened fruit juices or 
jelly are available they may displace the sugar in the 
following recipe. More butter may also be added. A 
few thin slices of lemon are frequently added to make 
a LEMON PUDDING SAUCE. 

DRAWN BUTTER, With Sugar 
MATERIALS : 

1 cup water ^ cup sugar 

2 level tablespoons flour 1 level tablespoon butter 

PREPARATION : 

Heat the water ; mix the sugar and flour thoroughly. 
Stir into the hot water with the butter. Cook until 
creamy. 

CREAM SAUCES 

Explanatory: — Cream sauces without sugar are the 
base for any wanted seasoning which may be added as 
desired, such as lemon juice, peppers, parsley, eggs 
cooked or uncooked, fish, etc., and are used, (1st) for 
soups, (2nd) as accompaniment for meats, fish and 
vegetable dishes, (3rd) as a medium for croquettes and 
timbales. The sauces only differ as to consistency. 

CREAM SAUCE, (No. 1, Thin) 
MATERIALS: 

1 cup milk 54 teaspoon salt 

1 level tablespoon butter 1 level tablespoon flour 

CREAM SAUCE, (No. 2, Medium) 

MATERIALS: 

1 cup milk % teaspoon salt 

2 level tablespoons butter 2 level tablespoons flour 

219 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

CREAM SAUCE, (No. 3, Thick) 

MATERIALS: 

1 cup milk Yz teaspoon salt 

4 level tablespoons butter 4 or 5 level tablespoons flour 
PREPARATION : 

There are three ways of making which apply to all 
three sauces. The butter may be omitted in No. 1 : 

Method No. 1: — Mix the flour with about half its 
bulk of milk, beat smooth and add enough more to 
thin sufficiently to add to the hot milk without lumps. 
Heat the milk and stir in the mixture with the butter 
and salt. Cook until creamy. 

Method No. 2: — Warm the butter in a saucepan, 
cream in the flour, add the milk and cook until creamy 
after adding salt. 

Method No. 3: — Heat the milk in a double boiler, 
cream the butter and flour thoroughly, then stir into 
the milk until creamy. Add the salt. As the butter dis- 
solves in the hot milk the flour is taken up. 

CREAM SAUCES, Sweetened 

Explanatory: — These sauces are the base for a 
variety of flavorings and combinations, more or less 
flour or sweetening may be used or the sugar may be 
replaced by jelly or fruit juices. Eggs, either yolks or 
whites, may be added. There is just one right method 
of cooking. 

CREAM SAUCE, With Sugar 

MATERIALS : 

1 cup hot milk ^ cup sugar 

2 level tablespoons flour 1 level tablespoon butter 
PREPARATION : 

Mix flour and sugar thoroughly and stir into the hot 

milk, adding the butter. Cook until creamy.

SALADS AND RELISHES 

"Of herbs and other country messes, 
Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses." 

Instinctively the accomplished hostess puts forth her 
best effort in the preparation of a salad, realizing that 
this is the true test of culinary competency. 

Before going into the detail of the work it may be 
well to submit a dietetic caution in reference to salad 
materials and the eating thereof. 

All salad materials in the nature of green vegetables 
must be tender and fresh as possible to maintain their 
digestibility. Cooked vegetables, meats and fish even 
in small quantities, known as scraps, may be used, but 
these must not be mushy or stale. Then, too, remember 
that when served as a relish with hot meats, even 
though in a separate course, a salad must be in a mod- 
erate quantity and composed of the lighter, most di- 
gestible salad materials. In such instances salads are 
intended to supply intestinal ballast and mineral salts. 
Green vegetables are the most valuable source from 
which this supply can be obtained. 

For many salads the plain dressing of oil and vine- 
gar or lemon juice with seasoning of salt and pepper is 
to be preferred, while others are equally good with the 
plain dressing or the richer mayonnaise. 

For those who do not like the oil dressing there are 
quite a number of cooked dressings. 

SALAD PLANTS 

Explanatory : — The salad plants are classed as ideal 
ballast in the dietary, supplying as they do natural 
mineral salts and volatile oils which by reason of form 
in which they are eaten, do not lose these attributes by 
cooking. 

221 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Salad Plants when so served are much better and 
more appropriately dressed with a French dressing or 
in some cases with a whipped cream dressing rather 
than the heavier cooked or mayonnaise dressing. 

They are kept fresh and become crisp by folding in 
wet towel and keeping in cool place or near ice. If 
freshly pulled they should be allowed to remain in wet 
towel one hour more or less before serving. 

LETTUCE 

One of our most common and universal salad greens, 
is by the aid of the hot-house and gardeners, seasonable 
the year through. 

Its principal use is in salads, but it is sometimes 
cooked and served like spinach. 

The hot-house and winter lettuce is more delicate in 
flavor than that grown out-of-doors. It is wholesome, 
cooling and palatable. 

It is too delicate to serve with cooked or mayonnaise 
dressing, and will not remain fresh long after mixing 
with any dressing. French is the better dressing for it. 
Many prefer it sprinkled with salt and eaten plain. An- 
other favorite way of serving it is with cream and a little 
sprinkle of sugar. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

It is almost impossible to make a perfect emulsion 
of oil and vinegar without using something for a me- 
dium. In the mayonnaise dressing this is accomplished 
by using the yolks of eggs. There are salads where the 
use of a mayonnaise seems out of place and the French 
dressing suits the palate. 

Do not expect to make an emulsion, just place the 
ingredients together and mix and pour over the greens 
or salad vegetables. Toss them with a couple of forks, 
and the oil will cling to the vegetables and the surplus 

222 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

vinegar or lemon juice will sink to the bottom of the 
dish. Putting the yolk of the egg with the French 
dressing is an expedient to hold the vinegar and oil in 
emulsion, but may not always be advisable. There is 
no hard and fast rule for the making of French dressing. 
The only definite rule is that whenever the oil floats, too 
much vinegar has been added. This is one of the rules 
that is proven more in the exception than in the observ- 
ance. 

At best six tablespoons of oil will require two 
tablespoons of vinegar, but one-half as much vinegar as 
oil is used frequently by many of the most particular of 
diners. 

METHOD : — The materials may be put together in 
a bottle, a patent stoppered bottle is very convenient 
for this purpose, as it is easily cleaned, and can be placed 
in the ice chamber of the refrigerator without fear of 
spilling its contents. Put the materials together, any 
time before serving, to chill and when salad is ready to 
serve, shake well and pour over the salad. 

If a "chaud-froid" (hot and cold) salad, such as the 
asparagus or hot greens, is desired, add the yolk of an 
egg, uncooked, to the materials in the bottle and the 
separation of the oil from the vinegar will not take place 
when poured into the heated dish. 

Worcestershire, Harvey, Walnut, anchovy or to- 
basco sauce may be used to season a French dressing. 
Or an aromatic vinegar may be used instead of the plain. 
Onion juice or tomato catsup is equally in favor as sea- 
soning. 

Rubbing the salad dish with a cut clove of garlic is 
a popular seasoning. 

Do not, of course, use more than two of these differ- 
ent seasonings together, and they may all be omitted. 

Many epicures prefer the plain French dressing, and 
insist upon mixing it at the table. 

223 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

The epicure mixes the salad and dressing by de- 
grees. To do this easily, sprinkle over the salad the 
pepper, salt and any other seasoning. Pour over the 
desired quantity of oil. Toss and turn until each leaf is 
seasoned. Then pour over the desired quantity of vine- 
gar and toss again until the whole is evenly distributed. 

In preparing the salad for each diner, cut the lettuce 
v^rith shears and have everything in readiness. 

For family use the housewife puts the salad and 
dressing all together and serves it complete. By a con- 
stant change of seasonings a variety of salads may be 
made up of the same materials. 

Salads should hold a prominent place in the daily 
menu. 

The green vegetables contain the salts necessary to 
the well being of our systems. The oil contributes to the 
heat of the body and a small amount of acid aids in the 
digestion of other foods and lends zest to the meal. 

SEASONED FRENCH DRESSING 
MATERIALS: 

"%, cup of olive oil 1 teaspoon powdered sugar 

4 tablespoons of vinegar 1 tablespoon chopped onion 

1 tablespoon chopped 2 tablespoons rings of green 

parsley onion tops 

2 tablespoons chopped 1 teaspoon salt 

green pepper Y^ teaspoon white pepper 

3 drops tobasco 
PREPARATION : 

Mix these ingredients and let stand an hour before 
using. Mix again before pouring it over the salad mate- 
rials. 

GERMAN CREAM SALAD DRESSING 

MATERIALS: 

1 teaspoon sugar Yq, cup vinegar 

Yz teaspoon of white ^ cup very rich sweet cream 

pepper (Sour cream is preferred by 

1 teaspoon of salt many) 

224 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Mix the dry ingredients, add the cream and stir 
until dissolved, then add the vinegar, stirring all the 
time. Never add the salad dressing until just before 
serving. It is well to press gently between a towel or 
napkin all greens which have been chilled in ice water, 
that they may be perfectly dry before adding the dress- 
ing. When the salad dressing is poured over the wet 
salad leaves, it is diluted, and the greater part falls to 
the bottom of the bowl, a watery, insipid mixture. 

Evaporated milk is an excellent substitute for cream 
in this dressing. Use one-third as much vinegar as 
evaporated milk. 

SOUR CREAM SALAD DRESSING 

One cupful of thick sour cream, one tablespoon of 
lemon juice, three of vinegar, one teaspoon of sugar, 
one of mustard, salt and cayenne to taste, mix all to- 
gether thoroughly. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

MATERIALS : 

2 egg yolks, uncooked Vinegar 

2 egg yolks, cooked Lemon juice 

1 teaspoon of sugar Yz pint olive oil 

1 teaspoon white pepper 1 teaspoon mustard if 

1 teaspoon salt desired 

PREPARATION : 

The easiest and quickest method of mixing this 
dressing is to set a narrow, deep bowl into a butter jar 
containing some chipped ice. Have the oil and vinegar 
chilled. For mixing, use the medium size rotary egg 
beater. With a fork break up the yolks of the hard 
boiled eggs and make a paste of them with the uncooked 
yolks, add the seasoning, or not as you wish, at this 
time. Put the rotary beater into the bowl, pour in a 

225 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

couple of teaspoons of oil and begin using the beater, 
adding a little oil at a time. When very thick and 
shiny add a little of the vinegar or lemon juice, then 
more oil and vinegar until the mixture is stiff. Just be- 
fore time to serve, the mayonnaise may be improved by 
the addition of one-half cupful of whipped cream or 
the very stiffly beaten white of one egg. 

THOUSAND ISLAND DRESSING 

The Thousand Island Dressing is made up of ma- 
terials of food value, containing as it does — fat and 
protein, and served with fresh green vegetables or 
grape fruit with plain bread or rolls and butter, makes 
a complete meal of digestive and nutritive value. 
MATERIALS : 

1 cupful Mayonnaise 2 hard boiled eggs, minced 

dressing fine

larly nice for a fruit salad. This is free from mustard 
or seasoning of any sort, except salt, and can be con- 
verted into any kind of dressing preferred. 

Mix a level teaspoon of arrowroot or a well rounded 
teaspoon of cornstarch with just enough cold water to 
dissolve. 

Put one-half cup of water and one-fourth cup of 
vinegar into the double cooker with a dash of salt and 
three level tablespoons of butter or olive oil and the 
yolks of two eggs. Add a teaspoon of sugar and the 
arrowroot. Just before removing from the fire beat in 
with the rotary egg beater the stiffly beaten white of

vinegar to make it smooth and add to beaten yolks, then 
stir in the balance of vinegar. Mix the cold mixture 
with the hot and boil up once, stirring constantly. Beat 
the whites of the eggs very stiff and carefully fold in. 
Add salt and pepper to taste. If kept in a cool place 
this will keep a long time. 

GERMAN POTATO SALAD 
MATERIALS : 

Boiled potatoes Parsley 

Lettuce Thin strips of bacon 

Green peppers Minced onion 

Seasoning Salad dressing 

PREPARATION: 

Boil the desired quantity of potatoes with the jackets 
on ; do not over cook. Remove the skins and chill. Cut 
the green peppers into rounds after removing the seeds. 
Place the bacon in a shallow pan under the broiler fire 
and quickly brown or crisp, then cut into small bits. 
Dice the potatoes and chill. Place the potatoes in a 
large crock or bowl and the peppers, onion, minced 
parsley, bacon, and pour over carefully a German cream 
salad dressing. 

Serve on rounds of lettuce leaves. 

SPANISH SALAD 
Chop separately and very fine four large cucumbers, 
four large firm tomatoes, one bunch of crisp celery, the 
crisp centers of two heads of head lettuce, and three 
green chili peppers. Mix all together, add one table- 
spoon of vinegar, two tablespoons of olive oil, juice of 
one lemon, two or three drops of tobasco, salt and pep- 
per to taste. Chill until ready to serve. 

COMBINATION SALAD 
Tomatoes for salad are much better pared without 
first scalding. This can easily be accomplished with a 
sharp knife. Do not on any account slice the tomatoes, 

228 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

unless in very thick slices. There is nothing much more 
discouraging than to try to convey to the mouth thinly 
sliced tomato. Cut the tomatoes into quarters or 
eighths, according to their size, from stem to blossom 
end, and then once crosswise. Cucumbers may be sliced 
or cut into small cubes. Do not make the ancient mis- 
take of putting them to chill and soak in salted water, 
as the salt renders the cellulose fiber of the vegetable 
tough and less palatable or digestible. Put some head 
lettuce in ice water to chill and crisp, or place it in the 
fold of a wet towel and lay in the ice chamber of the 
refrigerator. 

For this salad the most appropriate dressing is the 
French. A convenient way of preparing this is to put 
the olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, a dash of tobasco 
and sugar if desired, into a bottle and place in the re- 
frigerator until just before serving, when it can be 
taken out and shaken well to form an emulsion of the 
vinegar and oil. By doing this there is no unnecessary 
hurry at the last moment. Have the bowl well chilled 
from which the salad is to be served. Combine the ma- 
terials, cutting the lettuce with shears. Pour over the 
dressing and toss all together with a salad fork and 
spoon, or with a couple of forks. Green peppers may 
be added. 

SPINACH AND EGG SALAD 

Wash and cleanse the spinach until it is entirely 
free from grit. Place in a tightly covered vessel, season 
with salt, and allow to cook tender in its own liquor. 
Press into a bowl when tender and put away in the re- 
frigerator to chill. Hard boil two eggs, separate the 
whites from the yolks by cutting the white lengthwise 
into quarters. Mash and mix the yolks with a heaping 
teaspoon of the mayonnaise dressing. Turn the mold 
of spinach into the salad bowl. Heap the yolks on the 

229 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

top, arrange the sections of egg whites around it. Then 
circle the base of the spinach with the mayonnaise dress- 
ing. 

A SAINT PATRICK SALAD 

Select three perfect heads of head lettuce, remove 
the withered outside leaves. Open up the heads, very 
carefully, removing the center leaves, thus making a 
perfect cup. Throw them all into the ice water to chill 
and crisp. 

Make a mayonnaise and color green by adding the 
following : 

Chop very fine sufficient parsley to make one table- 
spoon. Put it into a bowl and rub with the back of a 
spoon until it is reduced to a paste. During the rubbing 
add four or five drops of alcohol. Stir this into the 
mayonnaise dressing. 

Cut into dice two medium sized cold boiled potatoes, 
mince small onion fine and toss in with the potatoes, cut 
fine a couple of sweet green peppers after removing the 
seeds. Sprinkle the potatoes, onions and peppers with 
a little vinegar and salt. Just before serving take the 
lettuce from the ice water, dry carefully on a soft towel, 
arranging the three heads in a salad bowl. Shred with 
the shears the tender inside leaves and add to the other 
vegetables. Mix with the green mayonnaise and fill 
the green cups with the mixture. 

This is a very effective green salad to serve at any 
time. 

TOMATO en TULIP 

Select uniform medium tomatoes, scald them to re- 
move skin and chill. 

Divide the shell into eighths almost to the stem 
end, draw these sections back from the center pulp. 
Place the tomatoes on round of lettuce and fill each 
center with a spoonful of mayonnaise dressing.

CHICORY AND TOMATO SALAD 

WITH MUSHROOMS 
MATERIALS : 

1 head of chicory ^ cup of olive oil 

3 firm ripe tomatoes 3 tablespoons vinegar 

1 sweet green pepper 1 scant teaspoon salt 

2 medium mushrooms, 1 scant teaspoon sugar 

diced Dash of pepper 

PREPARATION : 

Clean and lay the chicory in cold water to crisp. 
Then line the salad dish with some of the darker green 
leaves. Dry the balance in a towel and cut in inch pieces 
with the shears. 

Cut the tomatoes, after peeling, in about eighths, by 
cutting in halves across and then cutting into quarters 
the other way. Take out the seed centers from the pep- 
pers and cut into rings. 

Add the diced mushrooms. Toss all of the salad ma- 
terials together lightly and pour over the dressing made 
by mixing the salt, pepper, sugar and oil together and 
then stirring in the vinegar. 

Transfer to the salad bowl. 

CHICKEN SALAD 

An old fowl may be used for salad. Clean and pre- 
pare the fowl for stewing, but do not separate at the 
joints; after having singed the fowl split it open down 
the back, it is then so much more easily cleaned. If the 
fowl is old put a little vinegar into the water in which 
it is to be cooked and keep the water just below the 
boiling point. A bay leaf or two will improve the 
flavor of the meat for some. The meat of the chicken 
must be freed from skin and bones and if you desire 
a white salad do not use anything but the breast meat. 
Cut this up into small dice. Mince fine one green pep- 
per. Put the two ingredients together and marinate 
with three tablespoons of olive oil and one of lemon 

231 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

juice well mixed. Set away in a cool place for a couple 
of hours. 

Cut well crisp celery into very small pieces. If the 
flavor of onion is desired cut up a Bermuda onion very 
fine. Mix all of the ingredients together and add either 
a mayonnaise or cooked salad dressing. Do not have 
the mixture sloppy or soft, turn into a deep bowl or 
vegetable dish to mold for a minute, then turn into a 
salad bowl lined with rounds of lettuce leaves. 

Garnish the mound of salad with slices of lemon and 
green peppers sliced crosswise. 

GREEN PEPPER SALAD HOLDERS 

A nice way to put salads in a lunch box is to use 
green sweet peppers. Remove the seeds after cutting 
off the small end of each pepper and stuff them with the 
salad. 

STUFFED PEPPERS 
MATERIALS : 

6 large sweet peppers 1 teaspoon salt 

1 pint finely chopped 1 tablespoon butter 

cooked meat 1 saltspoon pepper 

1 good sized onion ^ cup stale bread crumbs 

PREPARATION : 

Cut the peppers into halves, crosswise, remove the 
seeds and cut off the stem, wash them in cold water. 
Mix the meat, bread crumbs, salt, pepper and half of 
the onion grated. Stuff this into the peppers, stand 
them in a baking pan, put into the pan the remaining 
onion, sliced, the butter and a half pint of water or 
stock. Bake slowly three-quarters of an hour, basting 
the outside of the peppers every ten minutes. Serve as 
a luncheon or supper dish or as an entree at dinner. 

PICKLED PARSLEY (Rorer) 

Select perfect curly heads of parsley. Wash 
thoroughly in salt water, drain and shake dry. Put into 

232 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

glass jars of cold vinegar; to each quart allow one 
tablespoon chopped horseradish. Cover and stand 
away for use. 

This is especially nice for garnishing when parsley 
is out of season. 

SPINACH BLOCKS 



MATERIALS : 




Spinach 

Drop of tobasco 


1 egg 
Salt 



PREPARATION : 

After thoroughly cleaning, cook the spinach with- 
out other water than clings to the leaves. 

Cook in covered vessel over moderate heat, drain 
and chop very fine, drain again, mash and mix with the 
beaten eggy tobasco and salt. 

Put into shallow dish and put this dish into another 
of hot water. Set in the oven till well set. Cut into de- 
sired shapes and serve. 

Made with a dash of lemon, these are nice to serve 
with a fish course. 

CABBAGE SALAD 

Take the tender white center from a head of cab- 
bage. Shred fine and crisp in ice water. 

Make a cooked dressing of three eggs, three table- 
spoons of butter, five of tarragon, one teaspoon of 
grated horseradish and the same amount of mixed 
mustard and a good pinch of salt. 

Cook over hot water until creamy, when cold add 
an equal amount of whipped cream and stir into one 
pint of the shredded cabbage after folding it in a napkin 
to take away the surplus moisture. To this add a cup 
of pickled beets. 

Fill the cabbage shell and garnish with celery plumes 
and rings of beets. 

233 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

STUFFED CELERY— A Relish 

MATERIALS : 

1 dozen stalks celery 1 red pimiento 

54 pound cheese Salad dressing or thick corn 

Yz teaspoon curry powder cream 

2 egg yolks, hard boiled Salt and paprika to season 

PREPARATION: 

Cleanse and lay the celery in a wet towel on the ice 
for an hour or more to chill and crisp. Make a soft mix- 
ture of all of the materials. If some cream is used in- 
stead of salad dressing, the mixture will require a little 
more seasoning. 

Wipe each stalk dry and fill with the mixture. 
Sprinkle with paprika when filled. 

The stalks should then be cut into finger lengths 
and placed on cracked ice to serve. If prepared in ad- 
vance of the meal, return after filling to the refrigera- 
tor without the cracked ice. 

Do not cut away the small fresh leaves at the end 
of the inside stalks as they add to the appearance of the 
dish. 

For a picnic or basket lunch place two stalks with 
fillings together and roll each two in wax paper. If 
no ice is carried with the lunch an ice bag may be filled 
and wrapped in a towel and laid over them. 

MINT VEGETABLE SALAD 

One package of mint (or lemon) Tryphosa, three- 
fourths pint boiling water, one teacup vinegar, one tea- 
spoon dry mustard, one teaspoon celery salt; when be- 
ginning to congeal add following vegetables chopped 
fine: 

1 onion (J/i cup minced chicken can 

3 pimentoes be added also if desired) 

1 green pepper Add to mint jelly and congeal 

Yz cup shredded cabbage Serve with dressing or cold 

meats 
234 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 



CABBAGE AND BEET RELISH 



MATERIALS : 



quart raw cabbage, 

chopped 
quart cooked red beets, 

chopped 
quart vinegar 
cups sugar 



1 cup horseradish, grated 

2 level tablespoons salt 
1 level teaspoon black 

pepper 
54 level teaspoon cayenne 
pepper 



PREPARATION: 

Heat the vinegar, add to it the sugar, salt and pep- 
pers. 

Toss the beets, cabbage and horseradish together 
in large bowl. Fill quart or two quart mason jars and 
pour over the hot vinegar. 

This keeps perfectly without sealing and is a relish 
out of the ordinary. 

FRUIT SALAD 
MATERIALS: 

1 cup of Malaga grapes 3 oranges 
1 cup of walnuts or 2 bananas 

pecans Gelatin 

1 cup of celery cut in 
short pieces 

PREPARATION: 

Seed the grapes and set on ice while preparing the 
rest. Dissolve one-half package of any of the acidulated 
gelatines in one-half cup boiling water, adding the juice 
of oranges. 

Peel the oranges and divide into lobes, free these 
from pith and seeds and cut each piece in two pieces. 

Remove large section lengthwise from the covering 
of bananas, draw a silver knife the length of the fruit, 
cutting it in two without removing from the covering. 
Cut into sections about one-half inch, add this to the 
oranges, also the celery, grapes and the nuts which have 
been cut in small pieces but not chopped. Add the dis- 
solved gelatin which should be cold but not stiff. 

235 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Line a salad bowl with fresh crisp leaves of head 
lettuce. Mayonnaise dressing may be used in place of 
the gelatin, but the thought of mixing it with fruit is 
offensive to some. 

CHERRY AND FILBERT SALAD 

Select firm, large, red cherries. Stone them and in- 
sert in the cavity blanched filberts. Chill and serve in 
tall sherbet glasses with gelatine salad dressing. 

PRUNES AND PECAN SALAD 
Cook prunes according to previous directions. 
Drain and chill nice perfect fruit. Remove the pits and 
cut each prune lengthwise in quarters. Pour over them 
a little sherry or grape juice and set aside in the re- 
frigerator. Cut pecan nut meats into pieces lengthwise. 
Make a French dressing of three tablespoons of 
olive oil and two tablespoons of lemon juice, a dash of 
salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the prunes 
and nuts. Serve on lettuce leaves, with roast lamb or 
veal, lamb chops or at a luncheon with bread and butter. 

APPLE SALAD 

Select very large red apples, allowing half an apple 
for each person. 

Make the following dressing long enough before 
serving that it may be well chilled. 

DRESSING: 

Put one cup of sweet milk in a double boiler. Mix 
together three level tablespoons of sugar, two level 
tablespoons flour, one-half teaspoon each of mustard 
and salt. Add these to the hot milk, and then the yolks 
of two eggs mixed with a little cold water or milk. 
When cooked add the juice of half a lemon, cook a few 
moments and then set away to chill. Just before serv- 
ing add either the very stiffly beaten white of one egg 
or a cup of whipped cream. 

236 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Cut one-half cup of pecans into small pieces, do not 
mince. Prepare three apples by cutting them in halves 
crosswise and taking out the fruit in small pieces, cut- 
ting in dice and dropping into water, into which a few 
drops of lemon juice have been put. Dip each apple into 
the water once or twice so that it will not become red. 
When you have a shell in which to serve the salad you 
may notch the tops of each shell into points. Then allow 
the apple shells to remain in the water till ready to fill 
them. 

Quarter a banana lengthwise and then cut into inch 
pieces. Drain the apple thoroughly and mix with the 
banana and nuts and just before serving mix with the 
salad dressing and heap this in the apple cups. Prepare 
small six or seven inch plates by putting a border half 
way around the rim of the plate of sliced bananas, allow- 
ing the slices to just overlap. Set the apple cup in the 
center of each plate. If this apple salad is to be served 
at a luncheon or at the supper table, prepare a plate of 
almond wafers to serve with it. 

AMBROSIA SALAD 

Cut a small pineapple into thick slices, peel, take out 
the eyes and divide into sections two oranges, cut each 
section in two, boil one cup of sugar in water enough to 
dissolve it, add it, when cool, to the fruit. Then add the 
following ingredients: 

2 bananas, sliced 1 cup grated cocoanut 

1 cup maraschino "%. cup brown sherry or 

cherries grape juice 

Serve in tall sherbet glasses in which a crisp round 
of lettuce has been placed. 

GRAPE FRUIT SALADS 
Grape fruit may be served in several forms of salad, 
but in all cases the pulp must be perfectly separated 
from the white "rag," as the slightest particle will give 

237 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

a bitter taste. Serve the fruit on young, crisp lettuce or 
tender cabbage-heart with French dressing or mayon- 
naise. Chopped celery or nuts or some other fruit, as 
cherries or currants, make toothsome additions. A 
little sugar may be sprinkled over the fruit before add- 
ing dressing. 

PINEAPPLE CELERY AND NUT SALAD 
To a cup of diced pineapple, add one-half cup of very 

thinly sliced celery stalks, one-half cup of nut meats and 

one sour apple diced. 

Mix well and serve on crisp leaves of lettuce, with 

a fruit salad dressing. 

PINEAPPLE AND GRAPE FRUIT SALAD 
Mix one cup tart, chopped pineapple with a shredded 
grape fruit and half a cup of chopped nuts or celery. 
Add fresh, or some form of preserved cherries, and 
serve on lettuce with mayonnaise dressing.

Thoroughly chill a ripe watermelon. Remove the 
heart and cut into cubes. 

Cut the rim of one of the halves into vandyke points. 
Return the cubes to the shell and cover with a rich fruit 
salad dressing to which has been added some candied 
ginger shredded. 

KUMQUAT 

The kumquat is a delightful fruit salad material, as 
well as a choice table fruit, suitable for table service 
au naturel, for jellies, sauces, jams or candied delicacies. 

FRUIT SALAD FLUFF 
MATERIALS : 

1 can sliced pineapple, 1 cupful pecans

ENTREES, LEFT OVERS 

CHEESE SOUFFLE 

MATERIALS : 

Yi cup grated cheese 2 level tablespoons butter 

Yz cup milk 2 eggs (small) 

2 level tablespoons flour Salt and pepper to season 

PREPARATION : 

Put the butter in the saucepan, when melted, blend 
with the flour without browning. Add the milk and 
cook till thick, then add the grated cheese, salt and pep- 
per and cool. Separate the eggs, beat the yolks and 
whip them into the mixture. Beat the whites very stiff 
and fold them in. Turn the souffle into a well greased 
pan. Set the pan in a shallow dish of hot water and 
place in a moderate oven for about twenty to twenty- 
five minutes. Serve at once as it soon settles. 



SPANISH SAUCE 

Saute in some butter or oil some finely sliced onion 
and green pepper. Add one tablespoon (heaping) of 
flour. When well combined add two cups of tomatoes 
and one of water. Cook till creamy and then season 
with salt and a generous sprinkling of chili powder. 



ALMOND SOUFFLE 
MATERIALS : 

2 eggs (small) Yz cup milk 

2 level tablespoons butter Speck of salt 

2 level tablespoons flour Whipped cream 

4 level tablespoons sugar Finely chopped blanched 



almonds 



241 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Melt the butter in a saucepan and combine with it 
the flour and the milk. Cook until thick. Cool, add the 
yolks of eggs well beaten, the sugar and salt and lastly 
the stiffly beaten whites. 

Put the mixture into well greased ramekins or cups. 
Let them stand in a dish of hot water and bake in mod- 
erate oven one-half hour. 

Serve with whipped cream sprinkled with the 
almonds. 

LENTEN LOAF 

Butter a mold that holds about one pint. Decorate 
the sides and bottom with strips of cooked green pep- 
pers. Prepare a cream sauce by putting two cups of 
milk into a double boiler, add one rounding tablespoon 
of butter creamed with one of flour. 

To half this add three hard boiled eggs chopped fine 
and the whites and yolks of four eggs, beaten separately. 
Then add one-half cup of fine bread crumbs. Season 
well and turn into the mold. Set the mold in a dish of 
hot water and bake one-half hour. Turn it out care- 
fully, when cooked, onto a warm dish lined with crous- 
tades of fried bread. Add some minced parsley to bal- 
ance of the white sauce, heat it and pour around mold. 

A cup of cream of tomato soup left over from a pre- 
vious meal may be used for the basis of the mold and 
would be preferable to the cream sauce. 

CHEESE FINGERS 

Grate cheese to fill one cup. Grate dry bread to half 
fill one cup. Place one cup of milk over hot water, in a 
saucepan or double boiler. When hot add the cheese, 
bread crumbs, salt, pepper or paprika and one level 
teaspoon of mustard. When thickened whip in one 
beaten egg and turn into a buttered dish of such size 

242 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

that the mixture will be an inch in depth. Set this dish 
over a dish of hot water and cook fifteen minutes. 
When cold cut in finger length strips, roll in beaten egg 
and then in cracker meal and fry in deep oil in a fry 
basket. Drain on paper. Serve with bread and butter 
or with a green salad. 

CHEESE STRAWS 

Roll puff paste about one-half inch thick. Cut with 
a pastry cutter into strips three-fourths of an inch wide 
and five or six inches long. Brush with egg and water. 
Sprinkle with a strong grated cheese and paprika. 
Place in a shallow biscuit tin or baking sheet and bake 
in a quick oven. These are much superior to any other 
cheese straw. If desired, these may be made in two 
layers, rolling the paste about a quarter of an inch thick. 

WELSH RAREBIT 

A Welsh rarebit is never made without ale or beer. 
The several combinations of cheese, milk and eggs are 
sometimes misnamed Welsh rarebit but they are 
properly cheese custards. If for any reason you do not 
wish to use ale or beer in making a rarebit, refrain also 
from the use of the term. 

MATERIALS : 

^^ pound rich old cheese Salt, paprika, mustard and 
% loaf of 5c baker's bread clove of garlic 

1 pint ale or beer 

PREPARATION: 

Rub the chafing dish with clove of garlic. Break 
up the cheese and put into the dish and set over the hot 
water pan. When melted add the crumbed bread, pour 
in the ale and add the seasoning. Stir till cheese is 
melted. 

A dash of port wine or sherry gives the rarebit a 
heavier flavor, which is preferred by some. 

243 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Serve immediately on slices of toast or plain white 
bread. A pinch of soda is recommended with new 
cheese to make it more digestible. 

SPANISH CHEESE 

Place six large chili peppers in a hot oven and blister 
them, then rub off the outer skin, open the peppers and 
take out the seeds. Wrap each one around a thick slice 
of cream cheese and fry in butter or oil. Make a Span- 
ish gravy of six tomatoes or their equivalent in canned 
tomatoes, one red chili pepper, one clove of garlic, small 
onion, salt and pepper. Cook all together, thoroughly, 
strain and thicken the juice with butter and flour 
creamed together. When ready to serve pour the sauce 
over the fried peppers and cheese. Serve very hot. 

CHEESE AND TOMATO 

Fill a heated platter with rounds of nicely toasted 
bread. Put one cup of tomatoes through the puree 
sieve, so as to remove the seeds. Rub the chafing dish 
with a clove of garlic. Put the tomatoes in the pan with 
a quarter of a pound of rich cheese, broken or grated, 
and one cup lightly filled with bread crumbs. Season 
the mixture well, add a pinch of soda and cook until the 
cheese is melted. Pour this over the platter of toast. 
Serve hot. This is a good substitute for Welsh rarebit 
and much better for the family table. 

CHEESE PUDDING 

Grate half a pound of soft American cheese. Toast 
either white bread or light rolls sliced, trim the edges 
and place some of them in a pudding dish. Put a layer 
of the cheese and then a layer of toast, having the last 
layer of toast, which last layer should he buttered. As 

244 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

each layer of cheese is put into the dish, season it with 
paprika and very little salt. Add a pinch of soda to a 
pint of warm sweet milk and pour over all. Let stand 
five minutes and bake in moderate oven. 

CHEESE BALLS 

Cheese balls made from cottage cheese are dainty 
served with a salad and sometimes with the soup course 
instead of olives. 

Served with the soup or bouillon, mix the cheese 
with sufficient cream to handle and add chopped olives, 
either ripe or green, add a seasoning of salt and pepper. 
Shape into marbles and press between the halves of 
large olives. 

With a salad course serve the cheese balls pressed 
between halves of walnuts or pecans. 

STUFFED PEPPERS WITH RICE 

Split large bell peppers in halves lengthwise, remove 
the seeds. Season cold boiled rice with tomato sauce 
and some grated cheese. Fill the peppers with the mix- 
ture, cover with bread crumbs and grated cheese, season 
with paprika. 

Place close together in a saucepan and surround with 
water an inch deep. Bake one-half hour, basting fre- 
quently. 

STUFFED GREEN PEPPERS WITH 
SPAGHETTI 

Drop broken spaghetti into boiling salted water. 
Boil thirty minutes. Remove to colander or coarse 
sieve and stand in a dish of cold water to blanch, then 
drain. 

Proceed the same as with the rice in the preceding 
recipe.

2 eggs Flour to make very thin batter 

4 tablespoons cream or 2 level teaspoons baking 
milk powder 

Salt to season 
PREPARATION : 

Beat the whites of the eggs very stiff, add the yolks 
and beat again. Then add the corn, salt, cream, flour 
and baking powder. Fry in plenty of oil on a pancake 
griddle or frying pan. More flour would be required 
for frying in deep oil or fat. If corn from the cob is 
used, double the quantity of milk or cream. Serve with 
fried chicken, Maryland style. 

CHICKEN PATES 

As to the pate shells, much depends upon where they 
are purchased. There is on the market a substitute for 
butter, which a great many bakers find more convenient 
in making up great quantities, as it can be handled in a 
warm room, in fact, must be, as it has something the 
same quality as beeswax. Possessing this quality it 
makes a flaky but tough pate shell. 

The chicken for the filling is best prepared by split- 
ting down the back, without dismembering. Cook in 
water just to cover. Cover tightly and place in warm 
water over a slow heat and cook at a temperature of 
about 175 degrees Fahrenheit. When cooked set aside 
to cool before preparing for the sauce. When cooled 
take the meat from the breast and cut into cubes. Drain 
and rinse some canned or bottled mushrooms. 

Make a cream sauce of one rounding tablespoon each 
of flour and butter creamed together and one pint of 
sweet milk, heat the milk in a double cooker, add the 

246 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

creamed flour and butter, and cook till creamy. Season 
with salt and white pepper and stir in the diced white 
meat of the chicken and the mushrooms. The daintiest 
garnish is dried parsley crushed and sprinkled over the 
patties when filled. Serve on small or bread and butter 
plates. 

FISH PATES 

Cut slices of baker's bread one and a half inches 
thick. Remove the crusts and the greater part of the 
center, leaving a shell with the sides and bottom one- 
quarter inch thick. Fry a medium sized onion in two 
tablespoons of oil, add one and one-half cups of flaked 
cold cooked fish. Put into a hot oven one-half cup of 
grated stale bread until slightly browned. 

Add these to the fish with half a cup of milk, season- 
ing of salt, paprika, a tablespoon of minced parsley, one 
each of lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. Add two 
chopped hard boiled eggs, chopping the whites and 
yolks separately. Fill the bread patties with this. 
Brush the bread with melted butter and sprinkle grated 
cheese over them and place in a hot oven until the bread 
is browned. Any cold cooked meat minced fine may be 
used instead of the fish. 

PRUNE CROQUETTES 

Prepare some very fine cracker meal by drying well 
in the oven several crackers. Put them between two 
napkins or folded in a towel and roll to powder with a 
wooden rolling pin. 

Remove pits from the cooked prunes, make a pulp 
of them and mix in an egg and some of the cracker meal. 

Take up in tablespoonfuls, mold into shape and dip 
in beaten egg. Roll in the cracker meal. Drop into deep 
frying oil. Drain on soft paper and serve with a sauce 

247

RADISH CURRY— With Rice and Cold Meat 
MATERIALS : 

Yi cup rice 2 green onions 

6 radishes 1 level teaspoon curry powder 

4 level tablespoons 1 cup cold cooked meat 

drippings 1 cup hot water or soup stock 

2 level tablespoons flour Salt to season 
PREPARATION: 

Put the rice over to cook in two cups salted boiling 
water. Put the drippings in a small skillet. Slice the 
radishes in three pieces into the drippings to cook 
slowly, till wilted. Draw to one side of skillet to make 
room to put the curry powder into the drippings, then 
put in the sliced onions. After a minute add the flour 
and then the hot water. 
Season with salt. 
When cooked up add the meat. 
Serve the rice on one-half of a small deep platter, 
put the meat on the other half. 

Decorate with slices of pimento arranged in rings 
with tiny spray of parsley in the center of each. 

FRIED APPLES 

Wash, core and halve, from stem to blossom end, 
nice red apples without paring. Cut into half inch 
slices. Fry in olive or cooking oil or drippings until 
golden brown, turning with pancake turner. Remove 
hot platter and sprinkle with sugar. 

APPLE CROQUETTES 
MATERIALS: 

2 eggs 1 cup tart apple sauce 

Bread crumbs Cooking oil 

249 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION: 

Beat one egg, add to the apple sauce and mix with 
sufficient bread crumbs to mold into croquettes. 

Beat up the other egg, dip the croquettes into it and 
then roll in cracker meal and fry in deep oil. Serve 
with some fruit syrup. 

TIMBALE CASES 

MATERIALS: 

1 egg yolk 1 teaspoon of sugar 

% cup milk 1 teaspoon cottolene or olive 

34 cup flour oil 

% teaspoon salt 1 small kettle of frying oil 



PREPARATION: 

Make a batter of the materials. Heat the kettle of 
oil and place the timbale iron in the oil. When hot 
enough dip the iron in the batter and then into the deep 
oil. When browned invert the iron before taking from 
the kettle so as to permit the oil to drain from the tim- 
bale cases. Permit the weight of the iron to rest for a 
moment on the case, thus giving it a flat bottom. If 
the timbale cases show a tendency to stick to the iron, 
the iron is too hot and very likely the fat also. If the 
batter shows a tendency to slip off before getting it into 
the fat the iron is not hot enough. 

Garnish the cases by first dipping the extreme top 
into foamy egg white and then into minced parsley, 
being careful to have the parsley well dried before 
mincing. 

Place the timbale cases on a round of lettuce, fill as 
desired. They may be served as a luncheon dish or as 
an entree.

LEFT-OVERS 

To an economical soul and a careful housewife the 
small left-over dishes are a joy forever and offer much 
opportunity for ingenuity. 

^ The first requests made of the teacher of household 
science are for recipes in which to utilize the scraps 

253 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

which are too good to throw away, yet are not suitable 
to serve again in the same form. 

And it is remarkable the many delightful ways of 
serving these small portions of meats, fish, vegetables, 
and bread and cake crumbs. 

Among the most important of these are the meats. 
For instance, perhaps a broiled steak was the meat 
served at dinner. Now, as all good housewives know, 
a warmed over steak is the most undesirable dish unless 
the steak was served very rare in the first place and is 
carefully treated in the warming. To begin with, the 
member of the family who serves at the head of the table 
should be instructed to cut around the bone separating 
the meat from the bone and this bone will serve as an 
addition to the soup or stock kettle, which should be a 
part of every kitchen equipment and into which should 
go all bones and scraps that cannot be used in any other 
way. 

Right here attention should be called to the savory 
soup to be made from the carcass of a roast fowl. When 
there is no more to be served from the carcass of the 
fowl, break it up and consign it to the stock kettle, cover 
with water and simmer gently for about an hour, then 
strain the liquor and season to taste, if the fowl was 
stuffed with a sage and onion dressing, very little sea- 
soning will be required other than a little salt and pep- 
per and perhaps a green pepper minced fine. 

If some of the dressing is left over and was prepared 
properly in the first place and not the soggy mess that 
often answers to that name, it can be mixed with a little 
c§§." yolk, formed into marbles and cooked in the soup 
for ten minutes before ser\'ing, or dry bread may be cut 
into dice and toasted, adding them to the soup after it 
is served. 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Pimientoes cut into small pieces are a nice addition 
to any soup. They can be purchased at any representa- 
tive grocery in cans of two sizes, usually selling at a 
shilling for the smaller and a quarter for the larger 
size. I would advise the purchase of the smaller size 
for the first trial or small family, as they do not keep 
longer than four or five days, unless covered with vine- 
gar. 

A very serviceable stock kettle is the kettle which is 
part of the fireless food cooker equipment, with a close 
cover and more deep than large in circumference. 
These kettles are now on sale, for those wishing to 
make their own fireless cookers. 

Croquettes; Timbales — Croquettes and timbales are 
another medium for the use of left-overs. 

Left-over dishes can usually form a chief dish for the 
luncheon table or if the heavy meal is served at noon 
it may serve as the principal dish at the evening meal. 

It must be admitted, however, in this connection that 
to the very busy woman dishes made from left-overs, 
while effecting a saving of material, represent some- 
times a waste of time and effort that might be used to 
better advantage. Try to avoid useless economies.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

EGGS 

BOILED EGGS 

Explanatory: The albumen of egg coagulates or 
cooks at 130 degrees Fahr. Water boils at 212 degrees 
Fahr.; hence eggs cooked too rapidly or exposed to 
too great heat are rendered tough and not so easily 
digested. 

Method No. 1: Place eggs in a quantity of cold 
water; put over the fire and allow to come to a boil. 
If soft eggs are desired, remove at once. If the white 
is desired well cooked with yolk soft, allow to stand 
in boiling water one-half minute. 

Method No. 2 : Place eggs in rapidly boiling water, 
two quarts at least; remove from fire and allow eggs 
to remain uncovered from eight to ten minutes, time 
depending on how much cooking is desired. 

Method No. 3 : Place eggs in rapidly boiling water, 
allowing to continue boiling. For soft eggs remove 
promptly at three and a half minutes. 

The four minute egg insures no uncooked white 
around the yolk. This method, however, is the least 
desirable. If eggs are overlooked for a moment too 
long, drop them into cold running water and the cook- 
ing will be arrested. 

POACHED EGGS 

Have water in a skillet salted and heated to just boil- 
ing point. Break the eggs into a dish and then slip them 
into the water, moving the pan where the water will re- 
main hot but not boil. This method will produce an 
egg of jelly-like consistency. 

A muffin ring may first be placed in the water, one 
for each egg, or the aluminum egg poachers may be 
used. They are very convenient and practical. 

257 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

FRIED EGGS 

For two eggs select a skillet not larger than a tea 
saucer. 

Heat the skillet and place drippings or butter in it. 

Break the eggs into a saucer and slip into the skillet. 
Season with salt and pepper and cover. Do not have 
too much heat under the skillet. 

SHIRRED EGGS 

Put two tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan, 
cook slowly until it is a dark brown. Then drop in 
quickly two tablespoons of tarragon vinegar, cook for 
a moment and take from the fire. 

Divide between four shirred egg cups or ramekins, 
and add to each a sprinkle of minced parsley. Break a 
raw egg carefully in each, sprinkle with salt and a dash 
of pepper. Place in a hot oven until the whites are set.

6 hard boiled eggs % teaspoon salt 

^ cup milk . . % teaspoon mustard 

% cup stale bread crumbs % teaspoon paprika 
1 cup cooked ham 1 egg uncooked 

PREPARATION: 

Heat the milk and mix with the bread crumbs. Make 

a mixture of all the materials, with the exception of the 

cooked eggs. Then cover the eggs with the mixture and 

drop in hot fat or oil. 

These may be served hot or cold. 

EGG TIMBALES 

MATERIALS: 

1 heaping tablespoon 3 eggs 

each of flour and butter Seasoning of salt and pepper, 
% cup milk paprika and minced 

parsley 
PREPARATION: 

Cream the flour and butter. Put the milk into a 
double boiler and add the creamed flour and butter. Re- 
move from the fire. Beat the yolks with a rotary beater 
until thick and lemon colored. Add them to the cream 
sauce with the rotary beater and then add the seasoning. 
Beat the egg whites until stiff and add to the mixture. 
Turn into buttered molds. Place them in a pan of water 
and then into a moderate oven until firm. Turn onto a 
warm platter and surround with a Spanish sauce. 

EGGS AU GRATIN 

Butter individual dishes or ramekins, place in each 
two tablespoons of cream sauce. Drop into each on top 

259 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

of the cream sauce one raw egg. Sprinkle with grated 
or Parmesan cheese. Cover with another two table- 
spoons of the cream sauce. Sprinkle grated cheese and 
bread crumbs over the top and a dash of paprika. Stand 
the dishes in a shallow dish of hot water and bake in a 
moderate oven about ten minutes. Serve in the dishes 
in which they are cooked. 

EGGS IN TOMATO SAUCE 

These are prepared the same as eggs au gratin, using 
tomato sauce instead of the cream sauce. The cheese 
is omitted. 

PUFF OMELET. 

MATERIALS : 

3 eggs Rounding teaspoon of butter 
3 tablespoons warm water or three teaspoons of olive 

Pinch of salt oil 

PREPARATION : 

Separate the eggs, beat up the whites very stiff, 
drop in the yolks and a pinch of salt and beat again. 
Put the oil or butter into an omelet pan. Add three 
tablespoons of warm water to the eggs and turn all into 
the pan. 

Watch it carefully to see that it does not cook too 
rapidly and when well "set" around the edges, place in 
an oven or under the broiler fire until the top is dry. 
Just a moment is all that is necessary, if left too long 
it will settle back and fall. 

Have ready any desired filling. Just the moment the 
omelet is ready put the filling on the half of the omelet 
furthest from the handle of the pan and turn the other 
half over it. Turn onto a hot platter. This makes a 
delicious sweet entree or an acceptable luncheon or 
supper dish. 

260 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

SPANISH OMELET 

Put some slices of bacon into a frying pan, add one- 
half cup of water and cook until the water is evaporated. 
Then fry the bacon carefully. Remove the bacon and 
cook an onion chopped fine, add some nice whole meats 
from a can of tomatoes, dice the bacon and return to 
the pan, season all well with some cayenne and salt and 
keep hot while preparing the eggs. 

Break into a bowl the eggs and stir until mixed, but 
do not whip, add one tablespoon of warm water for each 
egg. Put the omelet pan over the fire with a teaspoon 
of oil or butter. When hot turn in the eggs and shake 
and lift, turning the soft part underneath until the eggs 
are "set." Turn the first mixture quickly over the eggs, 
fold once and turn into a hot platter. Serve imme- 
diately.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

FISH 

FISH ACCOMPANIMENTS 

Baked salmon is considered one of the most elegant 
of dinner fish and is rich enough in itself to furnish the 
heavy course. 

Care must be exercised to serve appropriate dishes 
with it, such as entrees, sauces, vegetables and desserts 
to make the dinner complete. 

Contrary to a heavy meat dinner, a rich dessert is 
desirable with a fish dinner. 

The entrees, however, must not be sweet. 

Certain vegetables associate themselves with a fish 
course. 

A baked salmon brought to the table with one-half 
of the platter banked with fresh crisp water cress is a 
feast for the epicurean eye, as well as palate. The cress 
not only garnishes the dish but sprigs of it should be 
served with the fish. 

Water cress, lending a zest to many dishes, is par- 
ticularly appropriate with salmon. 

The entrees that can be served are many and the 
leading ones are stuffed green peppers, French or cream 
pea patties, celery or macaroni croquettes, various 
vegetables au gratin with cheese, combinations of egg, 
mushrooms in many forms and the Italian pastes. 

The sauces are not so many, but more important as 
no fish is ever served without a sauce. 

Baked salmon requires one of the following sauces : 
Lemon butter sauce, sauce Bechamel, sauce Genoise, 
Hollandaise, sauce Tartare, anchovy butter, Spanish, 
Bernaise, piquant or horseradish sauce. 

The principal vegetables to accompany a fish din- 
ner are peas, string or butter beans, cauliflower, arti- 
chokes, fried green peppers or fried green tomatoes 
with Irish potatoes in many forms. 

263 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Salads of cucumbers lead, with combination, tomato, 
Cole slaw, pea and cheese salads following. 

Very finely shredded cabbage with green peppers is 
good. 

The dessert usually takes the form of a rich pastry, 
such as a lemon, orange, pie plant or pineapple pie. 

Puddings are not as acceptable in rounding out a fish 
dinner. 

The fishes not so rich as salmon are accompanied 
with a larding of bacon or salt pork, or a sprinkle of 
cheese. The larding is accomplished by cutting gashes 
in the fish and laying in long slices of the fat meat. 
Bacon has the preference. 

The soup to precede the fish is never of a meat stock, 
nor bouillon. It is usually a cream of some vegetable 
or fish, more often of a vegetable. 

The preferred stuffing for a fish is of bread with 
plenty of onion and green peppers minced fine. 

Grated cheese sprinkled over a baking fish about 
fifteen minutes before removing from the oven is a great 
addition, giving a piquancy much desired. 

SALMON DISHES 

A small family could hardly indulge in baked salmon 
unless a small one could be procured. Instead of trying 
to bake a slice of salmon, which at best could only be 
braised in the oven, ask your dealer for the tail end, and 
you will have the flesh and natural juices protected by 
the skin. 

There will not be the opportunity to stuff it but the 
dressing may be put into a narrow saucepan and basted 
frequently as the fish is basted. 

BAKED SALMON 

The directions here given for salmon will answer for 
any other fish. 

264 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Clean the fish by making an opening at the gills and 
drawing out the intestines. Cleanse thoroughly and 
stuff loosely. 

If no fish boiler or baker is at hand, substitute the 
loose bottom of a long cake tin or a very shallow long 
biscuit pan inverted in the bottom of a larger dripping 
pan. This is almost a necessity in order to dish the 
fish on the platter without disturbing its shape. 

DRESSING FOR BAKED SALMON 

Prepare bread by breaking it up, if very fresh. If 
dry, grate it on a coarse grater. 

To half a loaf, mince two sweet bell peppers and one 
small onion, season with salt and pepper, the juice of 
a lemon, two tablespoons of margarine and one-half 
cup of water sprinkled on the bread. 

If dry bread is used, just moisten enough to make 
it about like fresh bread, by grating it and sprinkling 
with water. 

Stuff the fish with this dressing. 

Add a little lemon juice and butter to the water for 
basting the fish. 

Bring to the table in a warm platter surrounded with 
water cress and garnished with slices of lemon al- 
ternately dipped in dry parsley and sprinkled with 
paprika. 

Serve with sauce Hollandaise. 

BRAISED SALMON 

Place a thick slice of salmon in a small dripping pan. 
Dredge lightly with flour or cracker meal. Dot with 
bits of butter and baste with a sauce made of one table- 
spoon of minced parsley, one tablespoon of butter, the 
juice of half a lemon, one teaspoon of horseradish and 
one cup of hot water. Season with salt and pepper. 
Bake quickly in a hot oven and baste frequently. 

265 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

A horseradish sauce is very good to serve in the early 
spring with almost any dish of fish, and is particularly 
nice with braised salmon. 

SALMON LOAF 
MATERIALS: 

1 can salmon 1 egg or 

IY2 cups bread crumbs 2 egg yolks 

Y2 cup milk 1 tablespoon parsley 

Yz lemon (juice) Paprika and salt to season 

PREPARATION : 

Open the can and turn out the contents some time 
before using. Discard the skin and bones. Pull the fish 
apart, retaining the liquor to which add the egg slightly 
beaten, milk and the lemon juice. Toss the materials 
lightly together. Put into a greased mold. 

Place mold in another shallow pan, surround with an 
inch and a half of water and bake in moderate oven 
about forty-five minutes. 

When ready to serve turn onto platter and sur- 
round with fish sauce, in which small gherkins are 
minced. 

SALMON LOAF— No. 2 
MATERIALS : 

1 can salmon 1 red pepper 

1 egg Pimento 

3 tablespoons milk Parsley 

1 cup bread crumbs Seasoning 

Prepare as in Salmon Loaf No. 1. Serve with sauce 
Tartare.

MATERIALS : 

Y2 pound cold boiled Juice of Y2 lemon 

salmon Dash of paprika 

Y2 teaspoon salt Y2 cup milk 

1 tablespoon minced 3 level teaspoons each of 
parsley butter and flour 

266 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Chop the salmon fine and add to it the salt, parsley, 
lemon juice and paprika, put the milk to cook in the 
double boiler. Rub the flour and butter to a cream and 
add to the milk when hot. Now stir this into the 
salmon. Turn onto a dish to cool. When cool, form 
into croquettes, roll in beaten egg and then in bread 
crumbs or cracker meal and fry in boiling oil. 

These may be served with a sauce tartar or cucumber 
salad. 

SALMON WITH PEAS 

Run the can opener all around a can of salmon so 
as to turn the contents out whole. Discard the liquid, 
skin and bones and separate the fish into large flakes. 
Sprinkle with the juice of half a lemon and let stand for 
an hour. 

Open and drain a can of peas and rinse through sev- 
eral waters. This treatment removes the tinny taste 
from both articles. 

Melt one tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, add one 
tablespoon of flour, stir until mixed, then gradually add 
one cup of rich hot milk, stirring until thickened. Add 
a pinch of mace, the drained peas, a high seasoning of 
pepper and salt. Then add the salmon and heat through. 

Have previously prepared the yolk of a hard boiled 
egg rubbed through a fine sieve, also some minced 
parsley. Dish the salmon and peas over some triangles 
of toast and sprinkle with the egg and parsley. 

SALMON TIMBALES 

Cook to a smooth paste one cup of bread crumbs in 
one cup of milk. Mix with this one and one-half cups 
of salmon. Beat two eggs lightly and beat into the 
mixture, season with salt and cayenne and add one cup 
of rich milk. Pour this into buttered molds or ramekins. 
Set them in a pan of hot water and bake about one-half

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

hour. For the sauce cream a tablespoon of butter and 
beat in the yolks of two eggs, one at a time, beating 
thoroughly. Season with salt, cayenne and juice of one- 
half lemon. Add one-half cup of boiling water and cook 
until smooth in a double boiler. 

Turn the timbales onto a warm platter and pour the 
sauce around. 

SALMON CURRY 

Open a can of salmon some hours before needed, re- 
move from the tin, separating it also from all the skin 
and bone. 

Put two tablespoons of oil into a small skillet and 
fry or saute in it a minced onion and when brown add a 
teaspoon of curry powder, then add three level table- 
spoons of flour. Blend well and pour in a cup of white 
stock and the juice from the salmon with the juice of 
one-half lemon. 

When creamy add the salmon and serve immediately 
with quarters of lemon. 

HALIBUT STEAK BAKED WITH TOMATOES 
(A Creole Recipe) 

Make a rich sauce of tomatoes, either fresh or 
canned, seasoning with a dash of sugar, salt, pepper, 
seeded and minced green pepper and onions. Cook 
fifteen minutes, strain and add some finely grated bread 
crumbs, not enough to thicken the sauce. 

Lay the halibut steak in a granite saucepan, pour 
the sauce over it, cover and bake twenty minutes in a 
hot oven. Just before removing from the oven take off 
the cover and sprinkle grated cheese over the top and 
allow it to brown slightly. The steak may be cut into 
pieces right to serve and baked in the baker of a double 
baking dish and served from it.

SMOKED HALIBUT WITH SPAGHETTI 

Cream together one heaping tablespoon of butter 
with one of flour. Place one pint of milk in a double 
boiler, add the creamed butter and flour and cook till 
creamy, season with white pepper and salt. Put into it 
one and one-half cups of smoked halibut that has been 
minced fine. Butter ramekins and line with bread 
crumbs, put in some of the creamed halibut and then 
a layer of parboiled spaghetti. Continue until the dish 
is filled with alternate layers. Sprinkle bread crumbs 
over the top that have been tossed in melted butter. 
Bake one-half hour in a moderate oven. Bring to the 
table in the ramekin. 

PLANKED WHITE FISH WITH POTATOES 

DUCHESS 

MATERIALS: 

1 fresh white fish weigh- Parsley 

ing three or four Salt and pepper to season 

pounds 6 medium potatoes 

2 lemons 1 tablespoon butter 
1 teaspoon butter 1 tablespoon flour 
Milk sufficient for cream- 1 cup milk 

ing potatoes Paprika 

PREPARATION : 

First peel the potatoes and have ready a kettle of 
boiling water so that when the fish is ready for the 
broiler there will be no delay in cooking the potatoes. 
After the fish is cleaned of all scales, etc., remove the 
head and tail. The fins are best removed by making an 
incision each side of them and drawing them out en- 
tirely, instead of cutting them off at the surface which 
only leaves the troublesome small bones to be encoun- 
tered at the table. In removing the fins on the back of 
the fish carry the incision on each side of the fins to the 
neck. In this way you can take away the line of small 

269 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

bones between the head and the back fins at the same 
time. To remove the remaining bones which form the 
skeleton, first expose the bones by scraping away the 
membrane then with a small, thin knife the flesh can 
be separated from the skeleton without destroying the 
shape. 

Have the plank well heated. Then lay the fish, 
skin side down, upon it and season with pepper and 
salt. 

In a small cup have prepared the juice of one-half 
a lemon, a teaspoon of butter and one-fourth a cup of 
hot water. Baste the fish with this quite often. Place 
the fish about three inches below the broiler fire. When 
the fish is seared over and beginning to brown, keep 
it well basted, and reduce the flame. A fish weighing 
four pounds requires about half an hour to broil. Be- 
fore removing the fish from the oven drain and mash 
the potatoes, adding butter, salt and pepper to season 
and when well mashed, add hot milk a little at a time 
until the potatoes are fluffy and creamy. Preserve the 
heat of the potatoes and increase the delicacy of the 
flavor by adding hot milk to the mashed potatoes instead 
of cold milk. 

When the potatoes are sufficiently creamy fill the 
pastry bag, in which a rose tube has been inserted, and 
force into roses on the plank around the fish. Garnish 
the fish with slices of lemon and and sprigs of parsley. 

To vary the ordinary slices of lemon, cut each slice 
almost in two, leaving one side of the rind intact, then 
turn each half in opposite directions. Dip one section 
in very finely minced well dried parsley. Sprinkle the 
other section with paprika. The board used for plank- 
ing fish is made of oak, either oblong or oval. The 
large size is about 16 by 10 inches at the longest and 
widest dimension. 

270 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

A shallow pan may be substituted for the board and 
inverted in the broiler pan, placing the fish on the bot- 
tom of this shallow one so as to easily remove. In that 
case, dish the fish carefully, without breaking, onto a 
large, hot platter, the platter being much larger than 
the fish, and garnish as usual. 

SPANISH FISH STEW 

MATERIALS : 

1 onion 2 green peppers 

2 tablespoons butter or oil Salt and pepper to taste 
1 cup tomatoes Minced parsley 

Flour 

PREPARATION : 

Place the butter in a stew pan, slice the onion and 
saute it, add the tomatoes, green peppers and season- 
ing. Bone and cut the fish in pieces to serve, and cook 
until tender in the stew pan without having the mixture 
bubble. When tender remove onto a warm platter. 
Garnish with minced parsley, and surround with the 
sauce, which has been thickened with the tablespoon of 
flour. 

CRABS NEWBURG STYLE 

MATERIALS : 

1^ cups crab meat 3 egg yolks 

1 oup cream ^ cup sliced or button 

1 wine glass of brown mushrooms 

sherry or ^4 cup Salt, white pepper and pap- 

rika to season highly 

PREPARATION: 

To prepare crab meat drop the crabs one at a time 
into hot water, allowing each to die before dropping in 
the next, when all are in the kettle add a tablespoon 
of salt, cover the kettle and cook just below the boiling 

271 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

point, about half an hour. When cool twist off the legs, 
detach the aprons, separate the shells, remove the 
stomach, intestines and gills or "dead men's fingers." 
Place the butter in a shallow saucepan and when 
melted add the crab meat and mushrooms, saute about 
five minutes, then add the sherry. Whip up the egg 
yolks and stir them in the cream and pour into the 
saucepan, keeping at a gentle heat till of a creamy con- 
sistency. Care must be taken not to cook so long that 
the egg yolks will coagulate or harden and thus cause 
the mixture to curdle. 

CRABS 

The soft-shell crab is the crab in a state of transition 
after having discarded the shell. When the lobster or 
crab outgrows its shell, it has the power of splitting it 
down the back and drawing itself out of it, retiring to 
a secluded place until the new shell becomes hard and 
protective. The new shell becomes hard in a few days, 
hence the scarcity of the soft-shell variety. 

Some epicures consider the soft-shell crab a dainty 
while others may feel rightly that any animal in this 
state of moulting is not in the best of condition. 

Crabs are in season from May to September. One of 
the nicest ways of serving crabs is scalloped or au 
gratin. 

CRABS AU GRATIN 

If the crab is purchased alive, put it into warm 
water and allow it to slowly reach the boiling point. 
Cook for one-half hour. Remove from the water and 
cool. Twist off the legs and pull off the aprons, the 
loose flaps on the under shell. Remove the stomach, 
which is just underneath the head, also the little twist 
of intestines and the gills. Take out the meat and cut 
in small pieces. Butter well a shallow baker and 

272 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

sprinkle with cracker meal, and then a layer of crab 
meat. Season with salt and pepper, dot with butter, 
sprinkle with cheese. Then another layer of cracker 
meal and another of crab meat, having the top one of 
cracker meal sprinkled with the grated cheese. Pour 
one-half cup of boiling water on one tablespoon of 
grated horseradish and baste the dish generously with 
the liquor without putting in any of the horseradish. 
Bake in a moderate oven about half an hour. If de- 
sired individual ramekins may be used instead of the 
baker. 

LOBSTER COCKTAIL 

Extract the meat and cut it into pieces that are as 
nearly dice-like as possible. Chill the meat thoroughly 
and serve it with a glass of the most savory of cocktail 
sauces as an accompaniment. 

Remember that a heaping tablespoon of green pep- 
per minced in each glass will improve and add a delicacy 
to any kind of cocktail or salad. 

DEVILED CLAMS 

MATERIALS : 

2 dozen clams 3 tablespoons melted butter 

Bread crumbs Salt, pepper and Worcester- 

1 teaspoon grated onion shire sauce to season 

1 teaspoon minced parsley 

PREPARATION: 

Chop fine the clams, removing the tough parts. Mix 
with bread crumbs and seasoning. 

Put into clam shells or ramekins, dot with butter 
and bake till a light brown. 

FRIED SCALLOPS 

Select scallops with a yellowish instead of the white 
color, the latter were soaked in soda water to bleach and 

273 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

make them swell. Rinse them quickly in cold water and 
dry well. Dip them in a cooked or bottled salad dressing, 
roll them in bread or cracker meal and fry, preferably 
in deep fat or oil. 

Serve these with slices of broiled bacon and a sauce 
Tartare. 

CUTLETS OF PIKE 

Procure a pike weighing from three to four pounds. 
After carefully cleaning and scaling remove the head 
very close and with a sharp, thin knife remove the fin 
that is beneath the skin. Take out the backbone and 
cut off the very thin strip from the underside of the fish. 
These three latter trimmings can be converted into a 
nice fish soup stock by placing them in a saucepan, cov- 
ering with cold water and allowing them to simmer 
slowly for one hour. Salt, strain and put away to keep 
cool until the following day, when you will be prepared 
with the foundation for a puree of pike. The left-over 
cutlets may be freed from skin and flaked into the puree. 

To resume. When the fish is thus ready, cut it in 
inch and a half wide strips across the fish. 

Have a dish of cracker meal well seasoned with salt 
and pepper. Dip the cutlets in this and roll up, secur- 
ing each one with a toothpick, or running them onto a 
skewer. Saute the cutlets in oil and serve them with 
potato shoestrings and an appropriate sauce all on the 
same service plate. 

BROILED LAKE TROUT 

This fish is so rich that it yields readily to broiling. 

It is a little more convenient to use two long, shal- 
low pans for this. 

After cleaning the trout make two slits with a sharp 
knife from the center back to the head and remove the 
blubber, or fat, with the small bones imbedded. Then 

274 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

split it open. Place in the pan skin side up. Place in 
the gas broiler with the flame turned about half on. 
Leave for about ten minutes. Take from the oven and 
remove the skin. The flesh will be found to be juicy 
and rich. Season with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. 
Turn the other shallow pan onto the fish and turn it 
over, thus exposing the inside of the trout to the broiler 
flame. Season with salt and pepper. Return to the 
broiler and leave under a gentle flame for about fifteen 
minutes, if the fish is thick. Ten minutes' broiling is 
sufficient for each side of a three-pound lake trout. 
Serve with a simple horseradish sauce. 

FLOUNDERS 

The flounder is an ocean fish that comes to our 
markets. It is a very flat fish, very dark on one side 
and light on the other. It may be broiled, boiled or 
served as a fillet. When you read "fillet of sole" on the 
bill of fare, it is really fillet of flounder. 

A "fillet" of fish are strips of fish with the bone re- 
moved and the strips seasoned with salt and pepper and 
rolled up and fastened with a small skewer. The strips 
may be about an inch and a half wide. 

These fillets may be dipped in egg, then in seasoned 
cracker meal or flour and fried in deep oil, using a fry- 
basket. Or they may be sauted in shallow oil or drip- 
pings. 

TO PLANK SHAD UNDER A GAS BROILER 

The plank should be made of kiln-dried oak, hickory 
or ash, the first having the preference. It may be made 
oval or round and should be about one inch thick. 

Heat it well, oiling the top, split the shad down the 
middle. Remove the bones. Lay skin side down on the 
board. Turn over the thin middle portions, season 

275 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

lightly with salt and pepper and baste with a mixture of 
one-fourth cup of water, juice of one-half lemon and 
two teaspoons of oil or butter. 

Place quite near the gas flame for about five minutes, 
then place lower in the broiler and reduce the flame. 
Baste two or three times with the water and lemon juice. 

A medium thick fish will require about half an hour. 
Care must be taken not to allow the fish to dry out. 

About five minutes before removing from the broiler 
sprinkle with grated cheese and return to the oven till 
the cheese is delicately brown. 

When finished, remove all trace of grease or drip- 
pings from the edge of the plank with paper or a soft 
cloth. Surround with Saratoga potatoes. Garnish 
down the center with half slices of lemon dipped in dry 
minced parsley alternating with other half slices 
sprinkled with paprika. Serve with Roe sauce. 

FRESH COD 

This is one of the nicest of sea foods, having a flavor 
and texture that are dainty and delicate, very unlike 
the salted cod that all are more or less familiar with. 

Fried cod may be prepared much as other fish, tak- 
ing the precaution which I so often insist upon, that of 
cooking all kinds of fish so that the flesh will not be 
dried out. I find this fault with many cooks. They are 
often careless in the cooking of fish. 

Boiling is the least desirable method of cooking fish. 
It robs any fish of its best flavor and delicacy. If bak- 
ing, broiling or frying is not desirable, steam the fresh 
fish. The quality is thus retained instead of dissipated 
into the water as in boiling. 

For any recipe calling for boiled fresh fish try steam- 
ing and learn what a delicate dish you may have. 

276 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

FRIED FRESH COD 

The tail end of the fresh cod is particularly nice fried 
in shallow fat or oil. Scale it, but do not take off the 
skin. 

Place in a heavy iron or aluminum frying pan three 
level tablespoons of oil or fat. Put in the cod, turn the 
fire low, cover the pan and cook until almost cooked on 
the under side. Season with salt and pepper and turn 
the fish. Cover and cook until finished. In all it will 
require about twenty minutes to half an hour. 

Now have ready a warm platter. Split the skin 
down the center of the upper side and pull it away. 
Turn the fish onto the platter and remove the balance 
of the skin. In this way you have all of the delicacy, 
flavor and nutriment preserved to the fish and yet 
served without the offensive skin. The skin, after 
cooking, removes very easily in this way and leaves the 
flesh underneath it unbroken. 

Pour over the cod an egg sauce. 

CRAPPIES 

Crappie are usually served so crisp and dry that the 
diner has little upon his plate but a mess of crust and 
bone. Then, if he has been a disciple of Isaac Walton, 
he will sit back in his chair and talk reminiscently of 
the good old times when he used to sneak away with 
rod and line, and smack his lips over the memory of 
bygone feasts, when he and his companions used to 
wrap the fish up in leaves and a covering of clay and 
cook them in the hot ashes of their brushwood fire. 
Their only sauce was appetite, but let me assure you 
that those fish cooked in that way had all of their 
delicacy retained, and were indeed epicurean treats. 

Procure fish as fresh from the water as possible. 
After scaling and cleaning and removing the head, 

277 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

draw a sharp knife each side of the fins on the back from 
the head downward, and the same on the lower side. 
The fins can thus be removed easily ; then when the fish 
is placed on the table, it is a very easy matter to separate 
the flesh from the backbone, slipping the knife between 
the bone and the flesh at the back and removing the up- 
per half entire. It then leaves the rack to be taken from 
the lower portion. This is particularly important to 
the head of the table, as the larger fish can be served in 
two portions, leaving the rack on the platter. This will 
appeal to the careful mother where there are little folk 
at the table. 

FINNAN HADDIE, DELMONICO 

Select a thick fish, place skin side down in a wide 
saucepan or frying pan, cover with warm water and let 
stand for about half an hour. Then place over a slight 
flame and let simmer about one-half hour. Drain, re- 
move all the skin carefully into flakes and sprinkle with 
lemon juice. Make a sauce of one pint of milk and one 
rounding tablespoon each of butter and flour. Add the 
haddie, season well with pepper and salt. Serve with 
points of lightly browned toast. 

If au gratin is desired, pour the haddie and cream 
sauce into a shallow saucepan, sprinkle with grated 
cheese and bread crumbs and place in a hot oven till 
lightly browned over. 



LOBSTER a la NEWBURG 



MATERIALS ; 



1 large lobster 2 level tablespoons butter 

Y-z cup sherry Salt and white pepper or pap- 
3 egg yolks rika to season 

Yi. cup cream 

278 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

PREPARATION : 

Cook the lobster by dropping into boiling water and 
then setting the kettle off the fire, allowing it to stand 
ten minutes. Take out and drain. Place the lobster 
on its back. Cut down the center from the head to the 
tail. Take out the meat and cut into inch pieces. Put 
them into the saucepan with butter and seasoning, cook 
five minutes, then add the sherry and simmer five min- 
utes. Beat the yolks in with the cream and add slowly 
to the lobster. Serve on triangles of toast. 

This is a popular chafing dish recipe. 

Canned lobster may be substituted for the fresh. 

BAKED SHAD ROE— CREOLE 

Procure a good sized roe, rinse carefully in cold 
water then drop it into boiling hot salted water. Do 
not have the water boiling at a gallop, or it will disturb 
the arrangement of the roe. Let stand about ten min- 
utes, keeping the water at the same temperature. Take 
about a half cup of cracker meal and add a rounding 
tablespoon of flour, a dash of either pepper or paprika 
and salt to season. Roll the shad roe in this and place 
in a saucepan or small dripping pan. Surround with 
one-half can of tomatoes, in which have been mixed one 
onion and one green pepper minced fine. Season also 
with salt and paprika. Take slices of bacon about one- 
eighth of an inch in thickness, cut them into strips of 
the same width with a pair of shears. Pretty well cover 
the top of the roe with these shoestrings of bacon. 
Place in a moderate oven until about warmed through, 
then increase the heat and finish in a hot oven. This 
all will require about twenty minutes to half an hour. 
Baste frequently with the tomato sauce. 

It may be necessary to add a little hot water to the 
sauce and when taken from the oven thicken i£ neces- 
sary with some of the cracker meal. 

279 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

SHAD ROE 

The season for fresh roe lasts until about June and 
the prices of shad roe range from thirty-five cents to 
sixty cents and sometimes more. This means per set, 
not per pound, and the sets vary. Sometimes a set 
will not be large enough to more than serve two per- 
sons and then, as the season advances, one set will 
serve several. Prices for shad roe always range higher 
at the opening of the season and, paradoxically, as the 
roe grows larger the price grows smaller. The shad 
roe can be obtained without purchasing the fish itself. 

BOUILLA-BAISSE 

This dish is varied according to the place where it is 
made, depending upon what the market affords. It is 
often made up in much simpler form than the following 
and resembles somewhat, our fish chowders: 



MATERIALS: 




3 


tablespoons of olive 


1 pound of salmon 




oil 


1 dozen clams or oysters 


1 


clove of garlic 


2 fresh tomatoes or equiva- 


1 


pound of halibut 


lent canned, with seeds 


1 


bay leaf 


removed 


V^ 


lemon 


1 large Bermuda onion 


1 


small boiled lobster 


1 green pepper 


2 


cloves 


Salt and pepper to season 


1 


tablespoon minced 
parsley 


Slices of toast one inch thick 



PREPARATION : 

Mince the onion and garlic, cook to a delicate brown 
in a large kettle, with the oil. Then add the fish, cut in 
large pieces, the lemon sliced, the bay leaf, garlic, green 
pepper minced, the tomatoes, salt and pepper to season. 

Cover and cook gently for one and one-half hours, 
add about three cups of water and simmer. Wash the 

280 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

oysters and add them when the fish is cooked. Take the 
meat from the lobster in pieces, right size to serve. 
Around the rim of a large deep platter arrange the slice 
of toast, from which the crusts have been trimmed, 
place the lobster meat in the center and the other fish 
surrounding it. Distribute the oysters on the pieces of 
toast, season the liquor without straining and pour over 
all. Sprinkle with the parsley. Serve in soup plates. 

FROGS' LEGS, DELMONICO 

Cleanse the frogs' legs and drop into boiling water, 
cover and let them remain in it ten minutes, where the 
water will remain hot, but not boil. Prepare a sauce 
by putting one pint of milk in double boiler. Cream to- 
gether one rounding tablespoon of butter with one of 
flour. Stir this into the milk and cook till creamy. 
Season well with paprika and salt and the juice of one- 
half lemon. Mince one green pepper very fine and add 
to the sauce. 

The meat must then be removed from the bones in 
as large pieces as possible and stirred into the sauce. 
Line a serving dish with points of toast and over the 
sauce. Serve hot. 

FROGS' LEGS, FRIED 

The most popular form of serving frogs' legs is fried. 
Trim off the claws, cover them with boiling water, let 
stand for three minutes to blanch. Drain them and dip 
in beaten egg, roll them in well seasoned cracker meal 
and flour. Mix with the cracker meal about one-third 
as much flour, and season it all with salt and paprika. 
After rolling the frogs' legs in the preparation, place 
them in a fry basket and fry in deep oil or fat. They 
are so small that it is difficult to handle them in any 
quantity in a frying pan and they will not absorb nearly 
so much fat if fried in the deep kettle. But many never 
fry them any other way than in shallow fat. 

281 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 



Let me impress upon my readers the absolute neces- 
sity of cooking, either frying or sauteing, fish in vege- 
table oil. After fish has once been served in all its deli- 
cacy, nicely browned and free from the taint of animal 
fat, the family will never tolerate any other method of 
cooking. It is not especially necessary to have a kettle 
of deep oil. Take the ordinary frying pan and put into 
it a couple of tablespoons of any of the cooking oils, olive 
oil if you can afford it. Place the pan over a medium 
heat, if using a gas or gasoline range place an asbestos 
or soapstone mat under the pan and lower the flame. 
Fish does not require any more heat than frying of pan- 
cakes, only more time. Place them in the pan and cover 
it. When cooked on one side turn with a pancake 
turner. 

Fish may be rolled in cornmeal, flour or cracker 
meal. 

PIGS IN BLANKETS 

Select large oysters, rinse well and lay upon a napkin 
to drain. Have ready some cracker meal seasoned with 
a dash of paprika. Prepare thin slices of bacon, long 
enough to go once and a half around each oyster. Roll 
each oyster in the cracker meal and roll around each one 
a slice of bacon, fastening it with a toothpick. Place 
them into a dripping pan and into a rather quick oven 
until the bacon is crisped. Send to the table on a hot 
platter with slices of lemon. When the appetite is 
jaded and nothing looks tempting, try the pigs in 
blankets. 

OYSTERS en BROCHETTE 

Prepare oysters as in preceding recipe. Cut bacon 
into square pieces. Place squares of bacon and oysters 
alternately on skewers. Place in shallow pan, bake 
about twenty-five minutes in moderate oven. 

282 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

OYSTERS 

The recipes written by Eastern writers on cookery 
often have, as part of the preparation, "heat the oysters 
in their own liquor." This is understood by most read- 
ers who have not lived on the coast, to mean the liquor 
in which they come shipped in pails or sealed in cans 
from the coast. This liquor is largely water and stale 
water at that. 

What the Eastern writer intends is the liquor con- 
tained in the shell of the oyster as it is marketed in its 
natural state, in the shell. 

The little bivalve is considered, by those familiar with 
its habitat, a little scavenger at best and by many par- 
ticular persons even the liquor contained in the shell is 
discarded and the oysters rinsed in fresh water. These 
particular persons claim that this liquor is only "sewer 
water." Therefore it must be apparent that the water 
in which they are shipped must be quite unfit for the 
oyster stew, contrary to the thrifty cook who explained 
that "A quart of oysters goes a long way, the big 
oysters can be fried while the small ones and the juice 
will make the best kind of a stew." 

In this connection it is interesting to note the atti- 
tude of the orthodox Jewish people toward the oyster 
among other proscribed foods. It is being more than 
ever impressed upon the attention of medical scientists 
that the longevity of the orthodox Jew was due to the 
nature of his food and the habits of his living. Their 
fundamental principles of cookery were based upon cer- 
tain hygienic dietary laws and as long as these laws 
were heeded, long life, contented minds and freedom 
from digestive woes was their portion. 

Sea or fresh water food that is permitted in the 
orthodox Jewish cuisine is classified as fish, having fins 
and scales, thus prohibiting shell fish.

squares. If to be browned in the oven, butter lightly 
before cutting in squares, put on a baking sheet, dry 
throughout and brown delicately. These are more di- 
gestible than when fried. 

DUMPLINGS, FORCE-MEAT BALLS 

It will be found more satisfactory in most cases to 
cook, either boil or steam, the dumplings and force- 
meat balls in a different vessel from that in which the 
soup, consomme or bouillon are making. 

Following is a group of accessories for soups and 
consommes. With many of them it will be found neces- 
sary to dip in slightly beaten egg, so that the water will 
not break them. 

Many of them are suitable to serve with the fish 
course and in that case they would be dipped in egg, 
then in cracker meal and dropped into deep oil and fried, 
and then perhaps rolled in dry minced parsley. 

The latter method may be followed for the soup 
course, serving on side dish if preferred. They do not 
so readily deteriorate if not served immediately as when 
cooked in boiling water.

THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

Boil gently for thirty minutes, press through a colander. 
Add a pint of stock and a pint of milk. Allow this to 
come to the boiling point. Cream together two level 
tablespoons each of butter and flour. Stir this into the 
soup until smooth. Season and serve. 

FISH CHOWDER 
MATERIALS : 

1 pound of halibut or 1 medium onion 

fresh water fish free 2 medium potatoes 

from bones, uncooked 1 green pepper 

Yi pound salt pork or fat 1 cup rich milk 

bacon (diced) Salt and pepper to season 

PREPARATION : 

Put the diced pork or bacon into stew pan and brown 
slightly, drop in the onions and pepper. Then throw in 
the fish which has been cut into pieces as large as a small 

egg. 

When seared over add one-half cup of water, place 
the potatoes on top and cook till they are soft. 

Then turn in the cup of milk with the seasoning of 
salt and pepper. Cook up for five minutes. 

Serve hot. 

Note: — If the fish is soft and apt to cook to pieces, 
put the potatoes into the drippings instead of the fish. 
Then later add the fish ; cover and cook. 

SOUP STOCK 

Beef is the chief source of soup stock although all 
meats and fowl when stewed, can supply stock. Stock 
from fresh fish is suitable for fish soups. Beef stock 
is usually the most economical. The cheaper the cut 
for soup the better. 

The bones of the meat furnish mineral matter and 
gelatin. Gelatin is also obtained from cartilage, skin 
tendons, and ligaments. 

288 



THE CALUMET COOK BOOK 

If the caramelized flavor is desired the meat may 
be sauted and browned in fat before putting into the 
stock kettle but this is a cumbersome and old fashioned 
method. 

Better results are obtained by allowing meat and 
bones, with a pinch of salt, to stand in warm water 
half an hour, then place over low heat or simmering 
burner and allow to cook below the boiling point for 
half a day. Endeavor to cook at such a low point of heat 
that there will be no scum form over the kettle to be 
skimmed off, as the scum represents so much coagulated 
albumin of the meat gone to waste. 

To supply the caramel flavor and color add a few 
spoonfuls of caramel prepared according to directions 
for caramel, a supply of which should always be kept 
on hand. 

If stock is made from veal, lamb or mutton scraps 
a few shavings of lemon added to the finished soup 
add an agreeable flavor. 

Soup made from the carcass of a roast fowl has 
no equal for flavor and nutrition.

thickening by creaming butter and fiour in the pro- 
portion of a rounding teaspoon of each to a pint of 
milk. Season and serve with wafers. 

Any left over canned vegetables may be treated in 
the same way. A combination of celery and peas is

DIRECTIONS FOR MEASURING: 

Dip the spoon into the materials and strike off with straight edge of a 
knife. 

In measuring butter, lard or margarine, pack the cup or spoon closely and 
strike off with the straight edge of a knife. 

In measuring flour in the cup measure, tap the measure lightly to insure of 
no unfilled spaces. 

To measure 54 teaspoon divide a level teaspoonful lengthwise. 

To measure ^ teaspoon divide the half teaspoon once crosswise. 

A heaping measure whether spoonful or cupful means all the measure will 
hold. 

A teaspoon dipped full and drawn under the side of the can of Calumet 
gives practically a teaspoon and a half. This is a quick method to measure the 
one and one-half teaspoon to each cup of flour in making breads, biscuit, 
muffins, etc. 

In measuring Calumet for cakes, dip the teaspoon full and level with 
a knife, one teaspoonful for each cupful of sifted flour. 

The measuring cups for kitchen use vary in size. Most of the glass and 
aluminum are the half pint liquid measure. The half pint dry measuring cup 
which is not easily distinguished holds two level tablespoonfuls more than the 
liquid measure. 

The half pint based on the dry pint measure was the original measuring 
cup for kitchen use. But manufacturers are now generally making the kitchen 
measuring cup to conform to the United States Bureau of Standards' standard 
liquid measure. The small difference between the liquid and dry measure car- 
ries little effect in the making of breads and cakes, so long as the several in- 
gredients are measured in the same size cup to insure proper proportions.
