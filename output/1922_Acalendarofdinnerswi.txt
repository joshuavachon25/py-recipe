INTRODUCTION 



The word "fat" is one of the most interesting in food 
chemistry. It is the great energy producer. John C. Olsen, 
A. M., Ph. D., in his book, "Pure Food," states that fats 
furnish half the total energy obtained by human beings from 
their food. The three primaryy solid cooking fats today are: 



^r\ 




Butter 



There are numbers of substitutes for these, such as 
butterine, oleomargarine and "lard compounds." 

The following pages contain a story of unusual interest 
to you. For you eat. 



See Fa^e 2d3 




The Story of Crisco 



HE culinary world is revising its entire cook 
book on account of the advent of Crisco, a new 
, and altogether different cooking fat. 

Many wonder that any product could gain 
, the favor of cooking experts so quickly. A few 
months after the first package was marketed, 
practically every grocer of the better class in the United 
States was supplying women with the new product. 

This was largely because four classes of people — 
housewives — chefs — doctors — dietitians — were glad to be 
shown a product which at once would make for more digestible 
foods, more economical foods, and better tasting foods. 

Cooking and History 

Cooking methods have undergone a marked change dur- 
ing the past few years. The nation's food is becoming more 
and more wholesome as a result of different discoveries, new 
sources of supply, and the intelligent weighing of values. 
Domestic Science is better understood and more appreciated. 

People of the present century are fairer to their stomachs, 
realizing that their health largely depends upon this faithful 
and long-suffering servant. Digestion and disposition sound 
much the same, but a good disposition often is wrecked by a 
poor digestion. 

America has been termed a country of dyspeptics. It 
is being changed to a land of healthy eaters, consequently 
happier individuals. Every agent responsible for this national 
digestive improvement must be gratefully recognized. 

It seems strange to many that there can be anything 
better than butter for cooking, or of greater utility than larc^ 
and the advent of Crisco has been a shock to the older gener- 
ation, born in an age less progressive than our own, and prone 
to contend that the old fashioned things are good enough. 



The Story oj Crisco 

But these good folk, when convinced, are the greatest 
enthusiasts. Grandmother was glad to give up the fatiguing 
spinning wheel. So the modern woman is glad to stop 
cooking with expensive butter, animal lard and their inade- 
quate substitutes. 

And so, the nation's cook book has been hauled out 
and is being revised. Upon thousands of pages, the words 
"lard" and "butter" have been crossed out and the word 
"Crisco" written in their place. 

A Need Anticipated 

Great foresight was shown in the making of Crisco. 

The quality, as well as the quantity, of lard was 
diminishing steadily in the face of a growing population. 
Prices were rising. "The high-cost-of-living" was an oft- 
repeated phrase. Also, our country was outgrowing its 
supply of butter. What was needed, therefore, was not a 
substitute, but something better than these fats, some product 
which not only would accomplish as much in cookery, but a 
great deal more. 

When, therefore, Crisco was perfected, and it was shown 
that here finally was an altogether new and better fat, cook- 
ery experts were quick to show their appreciation. 

In reading the following pages, think of Crisco as a 
primary cooking fat or shortening with even more individ- 
uality (because it does greater things), than all others. 

Man's Most Important Food, Fat 

No other food supplies our bodies with the drive, the vigor, 
which fat gives. No other food has been given so little study 
in proportion to its importance. 

Here are interesting facts, yet few housewives are ac- 
quainted with them: 

Fat contains more than twice the amount of energy- 
yielding power or calorific value of proteids or carbohydrates. 
One half our physical energy is from the fat we eat in different 
forms. The excellent book, "Food and Cookery for the 
Sick and Convalescent," by Fannie Merritt Farmer, states, 
"In the diet of children at least, a deficiency of fat cannot 

10 




The Story of Crisco 

be replaced by an excess of carbohydrates; and that fat seems 
to play some part in the formation of young tissues which can- 
not be undertaken by any other constituent of food " 

The book entitled "The Chemistry of Cooking and 
Cleaning," by the two authorities, Ellen H. Richards and S. 
Maria Elliott, states that the diet of school children should 
be regulated carefully with the fat supply in view. Girls, 
especially, show at times a dislike for fat. It therefore is 
necessary that the fat which supplies their growing bodies with 
energy should be in the purest and most inviting form and 
should be one that their digestions zvelcome, rather than repel. 

The first step in the digestion of 
fat is its melting. Crisco melts at a 
lower degree of heat than body tem- 
perature. Because of its low melt- 
ing point, thus allowing the digestive 
juices to mix with it, and because 
of its vegetable origin and its purity, Crisco is the easiest 
of all cooking fats to digest. 

When a fat smokes in frying, it "breaks down," that is, 
its chemical composition is changed; part of its altered com- 
position becomes a non-digestible and irritating substance. 
The best fat for digestion is one which does not decompose 
or break down at frying temperature. Crisco does not break 
down until a degree of heat is reached above the frying 
point. In other words, Crisco does not break down at all in 
normal frying, because it is not necessary to have it "smok- 
ing hot" for frying. No part of it, therefore, has been trans- 
formed in cooking into an irritant. That is one reason why 
the stomach welcomes Crisco and carries forward its digestion 
with ease. 

Working Towards an Ideal 

A part of the preliminary work done in connection with 
the development of Crisco, described in these pages, consisted 
of the study of the older cooking fats. The objectionable 
features of each were considered. The good was weighed 
against the bad. The strength and weakness of each was 
determined. Thus was found what the ideal fat should 
possess, and what it should not possess. It must have every 
good quality and no bad one. 

11 



Tfu Story of Crisco 

After years of study, a process was discovered which 
made possible the ideal fat. 

The process involved the changing of the composition 
of vegetable food oils and the making of the richest fat or 
solid cream. 

The Crisco Process at the first stage of its development 
gave, at least, the basisof the ideal fat; namely, z pure vegetable 
product, differing from all others in that absolutely no animal 
fat had to be added to the vegetable oil to produce the proper 
stiffness. This was but one of the many distinctive advantages 
sought and found. 

Not Marketed Until Perfect 

It also solved the problem of eliminating certain objection- 
able features of fats in general, such as rancidity, color, 
odor, smoking properties when heated. These weaknesses, 
therefore, were not a part of this new fat, which it would 
seem was the parent of the Ideal. 

Then after four years of severe tests, after each weakness 
was replaced with strength the Government was given this 
fat to analyze and classify. The report was that it answered 
to none of the tests for fats already existing. 

A Primary Fat 

It was neither a butter, a "compound" nor a "substitute," 
but an entirely new product. A primary fat. 

In 1911 it was named Crisco and placed upon the market. 

Today you buy this rich, wholesome cream of nutritious 
food oils in sanitary tins. The "Crisco Process" alone can 
produce this creamy white fat. No one else can manufac- 
ture Crisco, because no one else holds the secret of Crisco 
and because they would have no legal right to make it. 
Crisco is Crisco, and nothing else. 

Finally Economical 

At first, it looked very much as if Crisco must be a 
high-priced product. It cost its discoverers many thousands 
of dollars before ever a package reached the consumer's 
kitchen. 

12 



The Story of Crisco 

Crisco was not offered for sale as a substitute, or for 
housewives to buy only to save money. The chief point 
emphasized was, that Crisco was a richer, more whole- 
some food fat for cooking. Naturally, therefore, it was good 
news to all when Crisco was found also to be more economical. 

Crisco is more economical than lard in another way. 
It makes richer pastry than lard, and one-fifth less can be used. 
Furthermore it can be used over and over again in frying 
all manner of foods, and because foods absorbs so little, 
Crisco is in reality more economical even than lard of 
mediocre quality. The price of Crisco is lower than the 
average price of the best pail lard throughout the year.

Crisco's Manufacture 



It would be difficult to imagine sur- 
roundings more appetizing than those 
in which Crisco is manufactured. It is 
made in a building devoted exclusively 
to the manufacture of this one product. 
In sparkling bright rooms, cleanly uni- 
formed employees make and pack Crisco. 

The floors are of a special tile 
composition; the walls are of white 
glazed tile, which are washed regularly. 
White enamel covers metal surfaces 
where nickel plating cannot be used. 
Sterilized machines handle the oil and 
the finished product. No hand touches 
Crisco until in your own kitchen the 
sanitary can is opened, disclosing the 
smooth richness, the creamlike, appetiz- 
ing consistency of the product. 



The Banishment of That "Lardy" Taste in Foods 

It was the earnest aim of the makers of Crisco to produce 
a strictly vegetable product without adding a hard, and conse- 
quently indigestible animal fat. There is today a pronounced 
partiality from a health standpoint to a vegetable fat, and 

14 




The Story of Crisco 

the lardy, greasy taste of food resulting from the use of ani- 
mal fat never has been in such disfavor as during the past 
few years. 

So Crisco is absolutely all vegetable. No stearine, ani- 
mal or vegetable, is added. It possesses no taste nor odor 
save the delightful and characteristic aroma which iden- 
tifies Crisco, and is suggestive of its purity. 



Explanation of "Hidden" Food Flavors 

When the dainty shadings of 
taste are over-shadowed by a "lardy" 
flavor, the true taste of the food itself 
is lost. We miss the "hidden" or 
natural taste of the food. Crisco has 
a peculiar power of bringing out the 
very best in food flavors. Even the 
simplest foods are allowed 
a delicacy of flavor. 

Take ginger bread for example: The 
real ginger taste is there. The true molasses 
and spice flavors are brought out. 

Or just plain, every-day fried potatoes; many never 
knew what the real potato taste was before eating potatoes 
fried in Crisco. 

Fried chicken has a newness of taste not known before. 

New users of Crisco should try these simple foods first 
and later take up the preparation of more elaborate dishes. 



Butter, Ever Popular . 

For seasoning in cooking, the use of butter ever will be 
largely a matter of taste. Some people have a partiality for 
the "butter flavor," which after all is largely the salt mixed 
with the fat. Close your eyes and eat some fresh unsalted 
butter ; note that it is practically tasteless. 



15 




The Story of Crisco 



Cfisco contains richer food elements than 
butter. As Crisco is richer, containing no 
^v^B^rTEjR ^ moisture, one-htth or one-fourth less can be 
■^^ -'?;.., used in each recipe. 

Crisco always is uniform because it is a manufactured 
fat where quality and purity can be controlled. It works per- 
fectly into any dough, making the crust or loaf even textured. 
It keeps sweet and pure indefinitely in the ordinary room 
temperature. 

Keep Your Parlor and Your Kitchen Strangers 

Kitchen odors are out of place in the parlor. When fry- 
ing with Crisco, as before explained, it is not necessary to heat 
the fat to smoking temperature. Ideal frying is accomplished 
without bringing Crisco to its smoking point. On the other 
hand, it is necessary to heat lard "smoking hot" before it is 
of the proper frying temperature. Remember also that, when 
lard smokes and fills the house with its strong odor, certain 
constituents have been changed 
chemically to those which irritate 
the sensitive membranes of the 
alimentary canal. 

Crisco does not smoke until it 
reaches 455 degrees, a heat higher 
than is necessary for frying. You 
need not wait for Crisco to smoke. 
Consequently the house will not 
fill with smoke, nor will there be black, burnt specks in fried 
foods, as often there are when you use lard for frying. 

Crisco gives up its heat very quickly to the food sub- 
merged in it and a tender, brown crust almost instantly 
forms, allowing the inside of the potatoes, croquettes, dough- 
nuts, etc., to become baked, rather than soaked.

The same Crisco can be used for frying fish, onions,

flavors or odors. After frying each food, merely strain out 
the food particles. 

16 



The Story of Crisco 

We All Eat Raw Fats 

The shortening fat in pastry or baked foods, is merely 
distributed throughout the dough. No chemical change 
occurs during the baking process. So when you eat pie or 
hot biscuit, in which animal lard is used, you eat raw animal 
lard. The shortening used in all baked foods therefore, 
should be just as pure and wholesome as if you were eating 
it Hke butter upon bread. Because Crisco digests with such 
ease, and because it is a pure vegetable fat, all those who 
realize the above fact regarding pastry making are now won 
over to Crisco. 

A hint as to Crisco's purity is shown by this simple test: 
Break open a hot biscuit in which Crisco has been used. You 
will note a sweet fragrance, which is most inviting. 

A few years ago if you had told dyspeptic men and women 
that they could eat pie at the evening meal and that distress 
would not follow, probably they would have doubted you. 
Hundreds of instances of Crisco's healthfulness have been 
given by people, who at one time have been denied such foods 
as pastry, cake and fried foods, but who now eat these rich, 
yet digestible Crisco dishes. 

You, or any other normally healthy individual, whose 
digestion does not relish greasy foods, can eat rich pie crust. 
The richness is there, but not the unpleasant after effects. 
Crisco digests readily. 

The Importance of Giving Children 
Crisco Foods 

A good digestion will mean much to the youngster's 
health and character. A man seldom seems to be stronger 
than his stomach, for indigestion handicaps him in his 
accomplishment of big things. 

As more attention is given to present feeding, less atten- 
tion need be given to future doctoring. 

Equip your children with good stomachs by giving them 
wholesome Crisco foods — foods which digest with ease. 

17 



The Story of Crisco 

They may eat the rich things they enjoy and find them 
just as digestible as many apparently simple foods, if Crisco 
be used properly. 

They may eat Crisco doughnuts or pie without being 
chased by nightmares. Sweet dreams follow the Crisco supper. 

The Great Variety of Crisco Foods 

There are thousands of Crisco dishes. It is impossible 
to know the exact number, because Crisco is used for practi- 
cally every cooking purpose. Women daily tell us of new 
uses they have found for Crisco. 

Many women begin by using Crisco in simple ways, for 
frying, for baking, in place of lard. Soon, however, they 
learn that Crisco also takes the place of butter. "Butter 
richness without butter expense," say the thousands of Crisco 
users. 

Tasty scalloped dishes, salad dressing, rich pastry, fine 
grained cake, sauces and hundreds of other dishes, where 
butter formerly was used, now are prepared with Crisco. 

"A Woman Can Throw Out More with a Teaspoon 
Than a Man Can Bring Home in a Wagon" 

Kitchen expense comes by the spoonful. Think 
^^ of the countless spoonfuls of expensive butter 
used daily, where economical Crisco would ac- 
complish the same results at one-third the cost. 

It should be remembered that one-fifth less 
Crisco than butter may be used, because Crisco 
is richer than butter. The moisture, salt and 
curd which butter contains to the extent of about 

20 per cent are not found in Crisco, which is a//, (100 per 

cent) shortening. 

Remember also that Crisco will average a lower price 
per pound throughout the year than the best pail lard. And you 
can use less Crisco than lard, which is a further saving.

The Story of Crisco 

Brief, Interesting Facts 

Crisco is being used in an increasing number of the better 
class hotels, clubs, restaurants, dining cars, ocean liners. 

Crisco has been demonstrated and explained upon 
the Chautauqua platform by Domestic Science experts, 
these lectures being a part of the regular course. 

Domestic Science teachers recommend Crisco to their 
pupils and use it in their classes and 
lecture demonstrations. Many High 
Schools having Domestic Science de- 
partments use Crisco. 

Crisco has taken the place of butter 
and lard in a number of hospitals, where 
purity and digestibility are of vital 
importance. ^"^"'' ^'^' ^''^ 

Crisco is Kosher. Rabbi Margolies of New York, said 
that the Hebrew Race had been waiting 4,000 years for Crisco. 
It conforms to the strict Dietary Laws of the Jews. It is 
what is known in the Hebrew language as a "parava," or 
neutral fat. Crisco can be used with both "milchig" and 
"fleichig" (milk and flesh) foods. 

Campers find Crisco helpful in many ways. Hot climates 
have little effect upon its wholesomeness. 

It is convenient; a handy package to pack and does not 
melt so quickly in transit. One can of Crisco can be used to 
fry fish, eggs, potatoes and to make hot biscuits, merely, by 
straining out the food particles after each frying and pouring 
the Crisco back into the can to harden to proper consistency 
before the biscuit making. 

Practically every grocer who has a good trade in Crisco, 
uses it in his own home. 

Crisco is sold by net weight. You pay only for the Crisco 
— not the can. Find the net weight of what you have been 
using. 

Bread and cake keep fresh and moist much longer when 
Crisco is used.

The Story of Crisco 

Crisco's Manufacture Scientifically Explained 

To understand something of the Crisco Process, it is 
necessary first to know that there are three main constituents 
in all the best edible oils. 

Linoline, 

Oleine, 

Stearine. 

The chemical difference between these three components 
is solely in the percentage of hydrogen contained, and it is 
possible by the addition of hydrogen, to transform one 
component into another. 

Though seemingly so much alike, there is a marked differ- 
ence in the physical properties of these components. 

Linoline which has the lowest percentage of hydrogen, is 
unstable and tends to turn rancid. 

Oleine is stable, has no tendency to turn rancid and is 
easily digested. 

Stearine is both hard and digestible. 

The Crisco process adds enough hydrogen to change 
almost all the linoline into nourishing digestible oleine. 

Mark well the difference in manufacture between Crisco 
and lard compounds. In producing a lard compound, to the 
linoline, oleine and stearine of the original oil is added more 
. stearine (usually animal), the hard indigestible fat, in order 
to bring up the hardness of the oil. The resultant com- 
pound is indigestible and very liable to become rancid. 



The following pages contain 615 recipes which have

ing Departments of different colleges and other educational 
institutions, and by housewives in their own kitchens. Many 
have been originated by Marion Harris Neil and all have

The Story of Crisco 

We will go to any length to help you in the cause of 
Better Food. We realize that women must study this 
product as they would any other altogether new article of 
cookery, and that the study and care used will be amply 
repaid by the palatability and healthfulness of all foods. A 
can of Crisco is no Aladdin's Lamp, which merely need be 
touched by a kitchen spoon to produce magical dishes. 
But any woman is able to achieve excellent results by mix- 
ing thought with Crisco. 

Let us know how you progress.

Use level measurements 



Things to Remember in Connection with 
These Recipes 

No need for Crisco to occupy 
valuable space in the refrigerator. In 
fact, except in most unusual summer 
heat, it will be of a better consist- 
ency outside the refrigerator. Crisco 
keeps sweet indefinitely, summer and 
winter, at ordinary room temperature. 

In making sauces, thoroughly 
blend the flour and Crisco before 
adding the milk. 

In using melted Crisco in boiled dressing, croquettes, 
rolls, fritters, etc., be sure that the melted Crisco is cooled 
sufficiently so that the hot fat will not injure the texture 
of the foods. 

When using in place of butter, add salt in the propor- 
tion of one level teaspoonful to one cup of Crisco. 

Remember that Crisco, like butter, is susceptible to 
cold. It readily becomes hard. In creaming Crisco in winter 
use the same care as when creaming butter. Rinse pan in 
boiling water and have the Crisco of the proper creaming 
stiffness before using. Unlike butter, however, Crisco's 
purity is not effected by weather. It remains sweet and pure 
mdefinitely without refrigeration. 

In deep frying, do not wait for Crisco to smoke. (See 
page 35.) 



22 



Remember That — 

When pie crust is tough: It is possible you have not used 
Crisco properly. Perhaps the measurements were not cor- 
rect. Perhaps the water was too warm, or the dough was 
handled too much. Shortening cannot make pastry tough. 

When fried foods absorb: It is because Crisco is not hot 
enough, or because you have not used enough Crisco. Use 
plenty and the raw foods, if added in small quantities, will not 
reduce the heat of the fat. The absorption in deep Crisco 
frying should be less than that of another fat. 

When cake is not a success: It is not the fault of the 
Crisco. Either too much was used, the oven heat not per- 
fectly controlled or some important ingredient was used in 
the wrong proportion. Crisco should be creamed with the 
sugar more thoroughly than butter, as Crisco contains no 
moisture to dissolve the sugar. 

When cake or other food is not flavory: Salt should have 
been added to the Crisco, for Crisco contains no salt. 

When there is smoke in the kitchen: Crisco has been 
burned or heated too high for frying. Or some may have been 
on the outside of the pan or kettle. 

When Crisco is too hard: Like butter, it is susceptible to 
heat and cold. Simply put in a warmer place.

depends on careful attention to every detail 
from start to finish. Quantities, both liquid and dry, should 
be exact. Small scales and weights should form part of the

How to Choose Foods 



■^ONEY can be spent to infinitely better advan- 

Ml tage in the store, than by giving orders at the 
i door, by phone or mail. Every housekeeper 
T knows how large a proportion of the housekeep- 
1 ing money is swallowed up by the butcher's bill, 

' ^"^^ so that with the meat item careful selection 

is most necessary in order to keep the bills within bounds. 
In choosing meat of any kind the eye, the nose and the 
touch really are required, although it is not appetizing to see 
the purchaser use more than the eye. 

Beef 

In choosing meat it should be remembered that without 
being actually unwholesome, it varies greatly in quality, and 
often an inferior joint is to be preferred from a first class 
beast to a more popular cut from a second class animal. 
To be perfect the animal should be five or six years old, the 
flesh of a close even grain, bright red in color and well mixed 
with creamy white fat, the suet being firm and a clear white. 
Heifer meat is smaller in the bone and lighter in color than ox 
beef. Cow beef is much the same to look at as ox beef, 
though being older it is both coarser in the grain and tougher; 
bull beef, which is never seen however, in a first class butcher's 
may be recognized by the coarseness and dark color of the 
flesn, and also by a strong and almost rank smell. 

Mutton 

To be in perfection, mutton should be at least four, or 
better five or six years old, but sheep of this age are rarely if 
ever, met with now-a-days, when they are constantly killed 
under two years. To know the age of mutton, examine the 
breast bones; if these are all of a white gristly color the animal 
was four years old or over, while the younger it is the pinkier 
are the bones, which, in a sheep of under a year, are entirely red. 

Good mutton should be of a clear dark red, the fat firm and 
white, and not too much of it; when touched the meat should 
feel crisp yet tender. If the fat is yellow and the lean flabby 
and damp, it is bad. A freshly scraped wooden skewer run into 
the meat along the bone will speedily enable anyone to detect 
staleness. For roasting mutton scarcely can be hung too long, 

25

as long as it is not tainted; but for boiling it must not be kept 
nearly so long or the meat will be of a bad color when cooked. 

Lamb 

The freshness of lamb is comparatively easy to distinguish, 
as if fresh the neck vein will be a bright blue, the knuckles 
stiff, and the eyes bright and full. 

Veal 

Veal is at its best when the calf is from three to four 
months old. The meat should be of a close firm grain, white 
in color and the fat inclining to a pinkish tinge. Veal is 
sometimes coarser in the grain, and redder in the flesh, not 
necessarily a mark of inferiority, but denoting the fact that 
calf has been brought up in the open. Like all young meat, 
veal turns very quickly, therefore it never should hang more 
than two or three days. In choosing veal always examine the 
suet under the kidney; if this be clammy and soft, with a 
faint odor, the meat is not good, and always reject any that 
has greenish or yellowish spots about it. The head should be 
clean skinned and firm, the eyes full and clear, the kidneys 
large and well covered with fat, the liver a rich dark clear 
color, free from any spots or gristle, while the sweetbreads 
should be firm, plump, of a delicate color, and free from strings. 

Pork 

The flesh of pork, when in good condition, is a delicate 
pinky white, with a close fine grain; the fat, which should not be 
too abundant, of a white color, very faintly tinged with pink; 
the skin should be thin and elastic to the touch, and the flesh 
generally cool, clean, and smooth looking; if, on the contrary, 
the flesh is flabby and clammy when touched, it is not fresh. 

Pork, like all white meat, is quick to taint, and never 
should be kept long before cooking. If you have the slightest 
doubt about pork, it is best to reject it, for unlike other meat 
which may be quite wholesome and usable, though not of 
precisely prime quality, pork must be in really first class 
condition to be wholesome, and therefore it is impossible to 
be too particular in the choice of it. Always if possible look 
at the tongue, for, as in beef, this is a very fair criterion of 
the condition of the animal; a freshly scraped new wooden 
skewer run into the meat along the bone is a good test of the 
freshness of the pork, and be careful especially to examine 
the fat, for if there be little kernels in it the pork is "measly," 

26

a very common disease among pigs, and one particularly 
unwholesome to the consumer. 

Pigs for fresh pork should be of medium size, not over 
fat, and under a year old. Pigs destined to become bacon are 
usually older and larger. Sucking pigs should be small, and 
are best when about three weeks old. A sucking pig should 
be cooked as soon as possible after it is killed, as it taints very 
quickly; unless fresh, no care in the cooking will make the 
crackling crisp, as it should be. 

Ham — Bacon 

Good bacon has the lean of a bright pink and fine in the 
grain, while the fat is white and firm. If the lean is high 
colored, it probably has been over salted and is old besides, and 
in consequence will be hard and salty; while if there be yellow 
marks in the fat, and a curious, rather musty smell, it will 
have an unpleasant taste. In choosing a ham always run a 
clean knife or skewer in at the knuckle, and also at the center; 
if it comes out clean and smelling sweet, the ham is good; 
but if out of order the blade of the knife will be smeared and 
greasy looking, and have a disagreeable, strong odor. 

Venison 

The condition of venison is judged chiefly by the fat, 
which should be a clear creamy white color, and close in 
texture. Always try venison by running a sharp knife along 
the haunch bone, which is usually the first to turn; if, in 
taking it out, the knife has a blackish-green look and an 
unpleasant odor, the meat is tainted, and unfit for use. 
Venison requires to be kept a considerable time before it is in 
proper condition, and needs great care in its management. 
It must be examined carefully every day, and if there is the 
slightest doubt, it should be washed in lukewarm milk and 
water, then dried in clean cloths, and when perfectly dry, 
should be covered thickly all over with ground ginger and 
pepper; when required for use, dust off the pepper and ginger, 
and wash the meat in a little lukewarm water, and dry it 
thoroughly. Venison, like mutton, improves with age, and 
this can be judged by the condition of the hoof, which in a 
young animal has a small, smooth cleft, while in an old one 
it is deeply cut and rugged. The haunch is the prime joint, 
its perfection depending on the greater or less depth of the fat 
on it. The neck and shoulder also are very good. They are 
used chiefly for stews or pies.

Hares and Rabbits 

A hare when fresh killed is stifF and red; when stale, the 
body is supple and the flesh in many parts black. If the hare 
be old the ears will be tough and dry, and will not tear readily. 
Rabbits may be judged in the same manner. In both, the claws 
should be smooth and sharp. In a young hare the cleft in the lip 
is narrow, and the claws are cracked readily if turned sideways. 

Poultry 

Poultry to be perfect, should have just reached their 
full growth (the only exceptions to this are "spring chickens," 
ducklings, goslings, etc., which are considered delicacies at 
certain seasons); they should be plump, firm fleshed, and not 
over fatted. Over-fed fowls are often a mass of greasy fat, 
which melts in the cooking and spoils the flavor of the bird. 
A hen is at her best just before she begins to lay; her legs 
should be smooth, her comb small, bright, and soft. A young 
cock has the comb full, bright colored, and smooth, the legs 
smooth, the spurs short, and in both the toes should break 
easily when turned back, and the weight of the birds should 
be great in proportion to their size. Contrary to the practice 
with game, poultry never should be kept long, as they turn 
easily, and are spoilt if the least high. They also require 
longer cooking, in proportion to their size, than game, and 
never should be underdone. Dark-legged fowls are best for 
roasting, as their flesh is moister and better flavored cooked in 
this way than the white- legged ones, which from their greater 
daintiness of appearance are to be preferred for boiling. 

Turkeys should be plump, white-fleshed, young, the legs 
plump and firm, black and smooth, with (in the cock) short 
spurs, the feet soft and supple; the eyes should be full and clear, 
the neck long, and the wattles of a bright color. A hen turkey 
is best for boiling. Like fowls, an old turkey is fit for nothing 
but the stewpan or the stockpot. Turkeys require hanging for 
at least a week, though they must never be "high" or "gamey." 

Geese always should be chosen young, plump, and full 
breasted, a white skin, a yellow smooth bill, the feet yellow 
and pliable. If the feet and bill are red and hard, and the 
skin hairy and coarse, the bird is old. Geese should be hung 
for a few days. Ducks, like geese, should have yellow, supple 
feet; the breasts full and hard, and the skin clear. Wild ducks 
should be fat, the feet small, reddish, and pliable, the breast 
firm and heavy. If not fresh, there will be a disagreeable smell 

28

when the bill Is open. The male is generally the more ex- 
pensive, though the female is usually more delicate in flavor. 

Pigeons always should be young and extremely fresh, and 
when so, they are plump and fat, with pliable smooth feet. 

Note — In selecting game pluck a few feathers from the 
under part of the leg; if the skin is not discolored the bird is 
fresh. The age may be known by placing the thumb into the 
beak, and holding the bird up with the jaw apart; if it breaks 
it is young; if not, it is old, and requires longer keeping before 
cooking to be eatable. 

Guinea-fowl are judged like poultry, but require hanging 
for some time. 

Fish 

Fish in good condition usually is firm and elastic to the 
touch, eyes bright and prominent, gills fresh and rosy. If the fish 
is flabby, with sunken eyes, it either is stale or out of condition. 

Salmon should have a small head and tail, full thick 
shoulders, clean silvery scales, and its flesh of a rich yellowish 
pink. When quite fresh there is a creamy curd between the 
flakes, which are stiff and hard; but if kept this melts, soften- 
ing the flesh and rendering it richer, but at the same time less 
digestible. 

Trout, in spite of the difference In size, may be judged 
by the same rule as salmon. However, it will not bear keep- 
ing, deteriorating rapidly. 

Cod, unlike salmon, should have a large head and thick 
shoulders; the flesh being white and clear, and separating 
easily into large flakes, the skin clean and silvery. Most 
people consider cod improves by being kept for a day or two 
and very slightly salted. 

Herrings must be absolutely fresh to be good, and when 
In this state their scales shine like silver. If kept over long 
their eyes become suffused with blood. 

Mackerel also must be quite fresh. They never should be 
bought if either out of condition or season. If fresh they are 
peculiarly beautiful fish, their backs of an Iridescent blue green 
barred with black, and their bellies of a pearly whiteness. 

Smelts should be stiff and silvery, with a delicate perfume 
faintly suggestive of cucumber. 

29

Halibut is a wholesome fish. It should be middling size, 
thick and of a white color. 

Lobsters^ Crabs, Prawns, and Shrimps are stiff, and with the 
tails tightly pressed against the body. With the former, weight 
is a great guide, as the heavier they are the better; but if there 
be the least sign of wateriness, they should be rejected at once. 

Vegetables 
Green vegetables always are at their best when cheapest 
and most plentiful. Out of season they never have the same 
flavor, however well they may be grown. Excepting arti- 
chokes, all summer vegetables, as lettuce, peas, beans, and 
asparagus should be cooked as soon as possible after gathering. 
The freshness of most vegetables may be ascertained easily 
*by taking a leaf or a pod between the fingers. If fresh this 
will snap off short and crisp, while if stale it will be limp and 
soft. It is an economy to buy winter vegetables, such as 
carrots, parsnips, turnips, beets, celery, and potatoes in large 
quantities, if you have storage room, as if buried in sand and 
kept from the frost they may be kept a considerable time. 
Onions should be kept hung up in a cool, dry place. If al- 
lowed to sprout the flavor becomes rank and coarse. 

Eggs 

A mode of ascertaining the freshness of eggs is to hold 
them before a lighted candle or to the light, and if the egg 
looks clear, it will be tolerably good; if thick, it is stale; and 
if there is a black spot attached to the shell, it is worthless. 
No egg should be used for culinary purposes with the slightest 
taint in it, as it will render perfectly useless those with which 
it has been mixed. Eggs may be preserved, however, for a 
considerable time without any further special precaution than 
that of keeping them in a cool place. A very effective method 
of preserving eggs for winter use is to rub a little melted Crisco 
over each to close the pores, and then to pack the eggs in 
bran, salt or sawdust, not allowing them to touch each other.

Methods of Cooking 



SHERE are seven chief methods of cooking meat — 
roasting, boiling, baking, stewing, frying, broiling 
and poaching. 

The first three are most suitable for joints 
weighing four pounds or more, but not satisfac- 
tory for smaller pieces which are liable to become 
hard and flavorless by the drying up or loss of their juices. 

Of the other three methods, stewing may be applied 
to fairly large and solid pieces, but it is better for smaller 
thin ones, while frying and broiling can be used only for steaks, 
chops, and similar cuts. 

Braising and steaming are combinations and modifi- 
cations of these methods. 

Roasting 

Roasting is one of the oldest methods of cooking on record, 
and still remains the favorite form of cooking joints of meat 
or birds. The success of every method of cooking depends 
largely upon the correct management of the fire. In roasting, 
this is particularly the case, as a clear, brisk and yet steady 
fire is needed. To roast a joint it should be placed before 
great heat for the first ten minutes and then allowed to 
cook more slowly. The great heat hardens the outside of 
the meat and keeps in the juices. If allowed to cook quickly 
all the time the meat is likely to be tough. The fire should 
be bright and clear. The joint should be basted about every 
ten minutes, as this helps* to cook it, keeps it juicy and 
improves the flavor. The time allowed is fifteen minutes for 
"every pound, twenty minutes over for beef and mutton; for 
veal and pork twenty minutes for every pound and thirty 
minutes over. 

Oven Roasting 

Roasting in the oven of ordinary coal stoves or ranges 
is not considered so good as roasting before an open fire; 
nevertheless it may be said safely that the greatest part of 

31 



Methods of Cooking 

meat roasting is done in close ovens. It appears, from var- 
ious experiments that meat roasted or baked in a close oven 
loses rather less of its weight than if roasted by an open fire. 

The excellence of a roast depends to a great extent upon 
the amount of basting it receives. 

Some cooks season a joint before it is cooked, while 
others season it with salt and pepper just before it is served. 
There is a difference of opinion as to which is the more cor- 
rect way of the two. Meat of newly killed animals requires 
longer cooking than meat which has been hung for a time. 

In warm weather joints require slightly less time for 
roasting than in cold. 

Boned and rolled or stuffed meats require longer cooking 
than the same joints would if neither rolled nor stuffed. The 
meat of young animals and that of old ones requires different 
treatment. As a rule young flesh, containing less fibrine, 
requires longer cooking. White meat, such as pork, veal and 
lamb, always should be well cooked and never must be served 
rare. The exact time and process of roasting must be left to 
the good management of the cook, who must be guided by 
circumstances and conditions. The crook's business is to 
serve the joint as full of nourishing qualities as possible. 
Though roasting is considered one of the easiest and most 
simple processes of cookery, it really requires quite as much 
attention to obtain perfect results as is necessary to prepare 
so-called "made" dishes, the recognized test for good cooks. 

Boiling 

Boiling (of fresh meat). — This is cookery by immersion in 
boiling liquid, which after a few minutes is reduced to simmer- 
ing. The object of the high temperature at first is to harden 
the surface albumen and so seal, the pores and prevent the 
escape of the juices. If continued too long, this degree of 
heat would tend to toughen the joint throughout; after the 
first few minutes, therefore, the heat must be reduced to 
about 180° F. The pan used for boiling meat should be only 
JTJSt large enough to hold the joint, and the quantity of liquid 
no more than is required to cover it. For the boiling of salt 
meat the general rule of first hardening the surface is not 
to be followed. The salting of meat withdraws a large pro- 
portion of its juices, while at the same time the salt hardens 
the fibres, and this hardness would be intensified by extreme 
heat. Very salt meat sometimes is soaked in cold water to 

32 



Methods of Cooking 

extract some of the salt, but whether this is done or not, 
the rule for boiling salt meat is to immerse it in cold or tepid 
water and bring slowly to boiling point; boil for five minutes 
to seal the pores and prevent any further loss of juice, then 
reduce to 180° F., and maintain a uniform temperature till 
the meat is cooked. Salt meat takes longer to cook than fresh 
meat, and the saltness may be qualified by boiling vegetables 
with the meat, turnips especially being useful for this purpose. 

Baking 

The actual differences between roasting and baking are 
not great, the terms being frequently interchanged. Meat 
loses rather less weight when baked than when roasted, but 
the flavor of meat is inferior and less developed. The heat 
of an oven being steadier, baking takes somewhat less time 
than roasting. In a gas oven having an open floor the current 
of air is not impeded, and such baking very nearly approaches 
roasting, and the flavor generally is acknowledged to be the 
same. 

Stewing 

Stewing is cooking slowly with a small quantity of liquid 
in a covered vessel. The method is specially suitable for the 
coarser and cheaper parts of meat, which are rendered 
tender without loss of their juices. The usual plan is to make 
a gravy flavored and colored to suit the stew, and after the 
ingredients are well blended and cooked to lay the meat in 
the boiling liquid. After about two minutes boiling, the 
temperature is reduced to simmering, about 160° F., a lower 
temperature than that required for a large joint of "boiled" 
meat. The time depends greatly on the quality of the meat, 
but none will stew satisfactorily in less than from one and a 
half to two hours, and the longer allowance is to be preferred. 

Broiling 

Broiling, sometimes called grilling, is cooking by the direct 
action of fire brought almost into contact with the meat. The 
outer surface is burned or seared, the albumen hardened 
and the juices, which have a tendency to escape on the side 
turned from the heat, are retained in the meat by frequent 
turning. The fire for broiling must be very clear, intensely 
hot and high in the grate. The utensil required for broiling 
is a gridiron, the bars of which are greased and heated to 

33 



Methods of Cooking 

prevent sticking and subsequent tearing of the meat. The 
gridiron is laid quite close over the heat, so that the lower 
surface is dried and hardened at once. 

The meat must be turned at very short intervals before 
the juices have been driven from the heat to the opposite sur- 
face. If once allowed to reach the surface, they will be thrown 
off in turning and lost, the meat being correspondingly im- 
poverished. By constant turning the juices are kept moving 
backwards and forwards, and the meat remains moist and 
full of flavor. Each side should be exposed to the fire about 
three times, and it is not desirable to use meat less than one 
inch or more than one and a half to two inches thick for the 
purpose. 

The thinner pieces should have even greater heat applied 
than the thick ones, as the longer thin ones are exposed to 
the fire the more dry and tasteless they become, while the 
thicker pieces may be slightly withdrawn after thoroughly 
hardening the surface and cooked rather more slowly that 
the heat may penetrate to the center. The frequent turning 
must be continued, or the juices will reach the hardened outer 
fibres, soften them, and escape. 

If a double broiler is used the turning is managed easily, 
but with a single gridiron care must be taken not to puncture 
the meat by using a fork. Steak tongs are made for the pur- 
pose of lifting and turning broiled meat, but a spoon or a 
spoon and knife will answer. A single rim of fat on the chop 
or -steak will tend to keep the edge moist and baste the meat, 
but too much will cause flame to rise in continuous jet, 
making the surface smoky. If there is absolutely no fat on 
the piece to be broiled, morsels of finely chopped suet may be 
occasionally thrown into the fire, so the sudden spurt of 
flame from this source leaves a deposit of fat on the meat 
which improves the flavor, and, without softening the albu- 
men, prevents its becoming uneatably hard and dry. 

Frying 

Frying may be looked on as a derivative of broiling, and 
passes by easy stages, from broiling on a slightly greased metal 
plate, or sautSing in a shallow pan in a small quantity of 
Crisco, to cooking by actual immersion into a bath of hot fat. 
In a house where small and delicately made dishes are in de- 
mand, and where variety in the re-dressing of cold meats has 

34 



Methods of Cooking 

to be studied, this frying in deep fat is one of the cook's most 
needed accomplishments. Though exceedingly easy to do 
well, it is also exceedingly easy to do badly. 

Deep fat frying, which means submerging the food in the 
fat, is far superior to shallow or saute frying, and can be done 
most economically with Crisco. Little is absorbed by the 
foods, and the Crisco does not take up the odor or flavor of 
the food which is fried in it. This characteristic makes it 
possible to use Crisco for frying one article of food after 
another. 

Use plenty of Crisco for frying. The temperature of the 
hot Crisco then will be but little lowered when the food is 
added. There is little absorption and what is left may be 
used for all frying, merely by straining out food particles 
after each frying. 

Sufficient Crisco should be put into the pan to fill it 
about two-thirds full. From two to three pounds for a pan 
eight inches in diameter will not be too much. Into this pan 
or kettle a wire "frying-basket" should fit quite loosely, the 
basket measuring quite an inch less across the top than the 
pan. 

Let Crisco get hot gradually in the pan. Do not put 
into an already hot container. No fat should be treated in 
this manner. 

Do Not Wait for Crisco to Smoke 

Heat Crisco until a crumb of bread becomes a golden 
brown in 

60 seconds for raw dough mixtures, as crullers, fritters, 
etc. 

40 seconds for cooked mixtures, as croquettes, codfish 
balls, etc. 

20 seconds for French fried potatoes. 

Seconds may be counted thus: one hundred and one, 
one hundred and two, etc. 

The fat may be tested also by dropping into it a little 
piece of the article to be cooked. When it rises to the top, 
bubbles vigorously and browns quickly, the fat is hot enough. 

When prepared, the foods must be placed in the basket, 
not too many at a time or too close together, and then lowered 

35 



Methods of Cooking 

gently into the fat. They generally will sink to the bottom 
for a minute or two, and only float when they have begun to 
brown. When a bright golden brown, take up the basket and 
let the fried things drain in it, over the hot fat, for a few 
seconds. Then take them out gently one by one, and lay 
them on a sheet of brown or kitchen paper. 

The draining over the pan is one of the principal things to 
attend to; if this be neglected, the fat will cling about the 
fried things, making them both look and taste greasy, whereas 
if properly drained in the basket to begin with, they will 
afterwards scarcely mark the paper. When, as is sometimes 
the case, no frying basket is used, each thing fried should be 
drained between a spoon and the edge of the pan. 

To Clarify 

It is economy to use three pounds in the kettle, clarify- 
ing the fat when it is put away. To clarify Crisco, take that 
which has been used for deep frying and when it has cooled, 
but not solidified, strain through a double thickness of cheese 
cloth, replace kettle on stove, drop several slices of potato 
into the Crisco and reheat. When the potatoes are golden 
brown, take out and pour the Crisco back into the tin. With 
this little care, fish, oysters, onions, chops, fritters, dough- 
nuts, etc., may be fried over and over again in the same Crisco. 

The dry or saute method of frying is less satisfactory, 
in that it is difficult even after much practice to produce a 
uniformly colored surface. A small quantity of fat only is 
needed, and where the fat, i. e., the heat, ends, a crack is 
formed in the outer coat, through which flavor escapes and 
fat enters; the appearance also is rendered unsightly. Flat 
fish can be fried fairly well by this method, or, indeed, almost 
any thin substance, as thin edges are not aff^ected in this way. 
For pancakes and other articles of similar nature it is the best 
method. It rarely is possible to use the fat from the dry 
method a second time, except for dishes of the same kind, as 
the fat always is more or less flavored by the food cooked in it. 
The most digestible fat for frying and the best for results 
undoubtedly is Crisco. 

Steaming 

Steaming is a process very similar to boiling, for it is 
cooking in the heated vapor of water. This practice as a 

36 



Methods of Cooking 

means of cookery is largely adopted in hotels, clubs, schools 
and hospitals, and other large institutions; also frequently 
applied in ordinary home cookery for particular articles of 
food requiring a very slow process of cooking. An ordinary 
kitchen steamer, with a close-fitting lid is generally all that 
is required for simple household cookery on a small scale. 
The articles of food which are to be steamed are prepared 
in exactly the same manner as for boiling. Many puddings, 
some meats, and some vegetables are considered better if 
cooked by steam, and inasmuch as the process of cooking is 
a very slow one, there is no fear of the food being destroyed by 
too fierce a heat, as the temperature in steaming never reaches 
beyond 212° F. Fish, meat and poultry cooked by steam 
are as a rule tender, full of gravy and digestible. By steaming, 
watery vegetables are made drier; tough meats are softened 
and made tender; while farinaceous mixtures and puddings 
develop a totally different flavor when baked or fried. 

Braising 

Braising is a combination of roasting and stewing small 
joints of meats in a shallow stewpan. It is a favorite method 
of cooking with the French, and is supposed to bring out an 
unusually fine flavor and aroma. The pan in which a braise 
is to be made always should be lined with slices of bacon, 
carrot, onions and herbs, upon which the meat is placed. It 
usually is moistened with stock or stock and wine. The more 
delicate meats, such as sweetbreads, fillets, fowls and turkeys 
sometimes are covered with buttered paper; this is done to 
prevent the heat from the top of the pan scorching or impart- 
ing too much of a roast flavor to the meats which are to be 
braised. Occasional basting during the process of this method 
of cooking is essential. When done, the meat is taken up, the 
fat removed from the vegetables and gravy, which latter is 
then reduced, strained and blended with some kind of gravy 
or thin sauce. 

Poaching and Marinating 

Poaching is the name usually given to the process of 
cooking an article by placing it for a few minutes in boiling 
water. Marinating or pickling is a process with a formidable 
name with a simple meaning. To marinate simply is to soak 

37 



Methods of Cooking 

meat in a mixture for some hours, or even days, with the 
idea of improving its flavor, of softening its fibres and making 
it tender. Vinegar, oil, pepper and salt are mixed together 
and the meat packed in the mixture; sometimes a sliced 
onion and herbs are added. The meat, of course, should be 
wiped first, but not washed. 

Cooking in Earthenware 

Stone or earthenware cooking appliances are used to 
very great advantage for various forms of preparing food. 
For the homely pot-au-feu the French housewife has used 
fireproof earthenware dishes for generations, and does so 
today. But besides soups, various savory dishes, and all 
sorts of stews are cooked in stoneware pots. Indeed, so 
much has this form of cookery come into fashion that many 
dishes are sent to table in the pots in which they are cooked. 
Cooking in stoneware has no equal where slow cooking is 
aimed at, and there are many dishes which one would do 
well to refrain from attempting unless cooked in this fashion. 
These cooking pots are inexpensive, and certain foods taste 
decidedly better if cooked in this way. For braising, pot 
roasting, or stewing fruit and other articles which need to be 
cooked slowly under close cover, the application of a moderate, 
even heat produces far better results than if quick heat is 
applied. For such cases the use of earthenware cooking pots 
is recommended.

All materials are measured level, i. e., by filling spoon or cup more 
than full and leveling with a case knife. 

To measure meal, flour, sugar and similar ingredients, sift lightly 
into the measure, then level. 

Standard measuring cups made of tin, aluminum or glass holding 
half a pint always should be used. Coffee and teacups vary so much that 
correct proportions can not be obtained by using them. 

To measure a spoonful of dry material, fill the spoon heaping, then 
level. To measure a half-spoonful, fill and level the spoon, then divide 
in half lengthways; for quarter-spoonfuls, divide the halves crossways. 

Use level measurements in all recipes in this book.

The ^rt of Carving 



^ARVING is an art, and one which anybody, 
with a knowledge of a few general directions, can 
acquire easily. 

A proper set of carving tools is almost indis- 
pensable, and should comprise: a good thin, 
sharp-bladed knife, a solid two or three pronged 
fork, and a pair of carving scissors. Anything that needs to 
be carved at table should be placed on a dish sufficiently- 
large to allow the joint to be turned without moving the dish 
from its position. The dish should be placed close in front 
of the carver. Such joints as beef, veal and ham should be 
cut very thin; while lamb, mutton, and oork should be cut a 
trifle thicker. 

To carve a fowl, begin by sticking the fork into the pinion 
and draw it towards the leg; and then, passing the knife 
underneath, take off the wing at the joint. Next slip the 
knife between leg and body, to cut through the joint; and 
with the fork turn leg back, and joint will give way. Then 
take off other wing and leg. After legs are taken oflF, enter 
knife into the top of breast, and cut under merrythought or 
wishbone so as to loosen it, lifting it with the fork. After- 
wards cut slices from both sides of breast. Next, take off 
collarbones, which lie on each side of wishbone and then sep- 
arate side bones from the back. The breast and wings are* 
considered the most delicate parts; the back as the least desir- 
able, generally is left on platter. 

A turkey is carved in same manner, except that the legs 
and wings, being larger, are separated at lower joint. Lower 
part of leg (or drumstick) being hard, tough, and stringy, 
usually is allowed to remain on platter. First cut off wing, leg, 
and breast from one side; then turn turkey round and cut them 
off from the other. 

To carve a goose, separate leg from body by putting fork 
into small end of leg, pressing it close to body, and then pass- 
ing knife under, and turning leg back as you cut through 
joint. To take off wing, put fork into the small end of wing, 
and press it closely to body, then slip knife under and sep- 
arate the joint. Next, cut under wishbone and take it off, 

42 



The Art of Carving 

and cut slices from breast. Then turn and dismember the other 
side. Take off upper side bones next to wings, then two lower 
side bones. The breast and legs of a goose are considered 
the most choice. If a goose is old, there is no fowl so tough. 

Quails merely are split down the back, as also are pigeons, 
giving a half to each person. 

To carve loin of muttony a portion is cut through, beginning 
at the best end. If kidney be in it, a slice should be 
served as far as it will go to each portion. Care must be taken 
that the bone is well jointed. The butcher chops the loin 
between each vertebra. When big mutton is carved it gives 
a large chop, oftentimes more than the amount desired, but 
a chop cannot be divided without waste, or one portion being 
all the inferior end. It is therefore a good plan to joint a loin 
of mutton with a small meat saw, cutting any thickness 
desired. In this case the actual bone will often have to be 
sawn through. The result will be more economical, and the 
servings more agreeable. The loin also can be boned entirely, 
stuffed or not, as preferred, the flap end folded and fastened 
over the fillet portion. Then the meat can be carved across 
any thickness. 

To carve leg of mutton, stand joint the inner part of 
the leg uppermost and cut across center to bone, towards 
carver, then cut rather thick slices on either side. To serve 
the meat equally, unless any special part is desired, a por- 
tion of the knuckle is served with a slice of the thick end. 
The prime fat is the kernel of fat at the thick end. 

To carve fore quarter of mutton or lamb. The forequarter of 
mutton usually is not served whole unless the mutton be 
very small. The forequarter of lamb frequently is served 
whole. Before cooking it must be jointed through the chine 
of bone at the back, to enable this portion being served in 
chops, twice across the breastbones the entire length, and at 
short intervals at the edge of the breast. Before serving it is 
usual to separate the shoulder by pressing the fork in by the 
knuckle, then passing knife round shoulder, crossing about 
center of joint, raising shoulder without cutting too much 
meat ofi^ breast. Leave shoulder in position on joint; a second 
dish is sent to table on which to lay it while the other part is 
being carved. 

To carve rabbit or hare. In either case first separate legs 
and shoulders; then cut the back part across, into two parts. 

43 



The Art of Caning 

This is accomplished best by inserting the knife into joint, 
and raising up the back by means of the fork. The back or 
fillet part is considered the best portion of a hare or rabbit. 

To carve sirloin of beef, a sirloin should be cut into thin 
slices with a sharp, firm cut from end to end of the joint. 
At the upper portion the cut should be clean and even; 
then use point of knife to loosen slices from bones. In carv- 
ing undercut, remove superfluous fat, and cut slices from end 
to end in same manner as upper portion. Be careful always 
to cut down straight to the bone of a sirloin or rib of beef; by 
so doing you will not spoil appearance of joint, and what 
remains will look tidy. 

To carve ham.^ Ham should be cut through to the bone 
first from center or near thin end. Slices must be cut thin. 
Always commence cutting from upper side. The fairest way 
by far, so as to serve fat and lean evenly, is to begin cutting 
from center of thickest part, and to cut thin circular slices; 
by this means the flavor of the ham is far better, and it 
will prove to be the more economical way of serving. 

To carve ox-tongue. Commence cutting from middle of 
tongue; cut slices not too thin and take them from each side 
being careful not to cut slices through to bottom part of 
tongue. Extreme end of the tip and the lower part of tongue 
generally are used up for chopping in salpicons, etc. A little 
of the fat should be put on each plate. When rolled tongue is 
served it must be cut horizontally into rather thin slices. 

To carve fish. A silver slicer or trowel should be used for 
this purpose; a steel knife applied to fish often spoils the 
delicacy of its flavor. Great care must be taken to prevent 
breaking the flakes, which ought to be kept as entire as 
possible. Short-grained fish, such as salmon, etc., should be 
cut lengthwise, not crosswise.

Calendar of Dinners^'* 




by Marion Harris Neil 



,>"'r,^ 



<SOU19><S 





N economical housewife may supply good 
gravy and thick soups at very little, if 
any, addition to the weekly expenses, as 
soups are an excellent method of using up scraps 
and bones from joints and vegetables that other- 
wise are wasted. Soup, if taken as the primary 
course of a substantial dinner, if well flavored 
and warm, acts as a stimulant in the stomach, 
exciting the gastric glands, and generally enabling that organ 
to perform its functions more easily. For this object the soup 
should be thin and not too much of it partaken, otherwise it 
dilutes the digestive juices too much. If it is to form the 
chief part of the meal, the soup will be more nutritious if 
thickened, especially so, if pulse — i. e., peas, beans, and 
lentils — is used as the thickening medium. 

Stock is the liquid in which meat, bones, or vegetables 
have been cooked, and which contains an extract from these 
substances. It is used for soups, sauces, and gravies. Fresh 
or cooked bones or meat may be used. A stock pot may be 
kept on the stove, into which are put any scraps of meat, 
bones, gristle, or vegetable; at the end of the day it is strained, 
and all fat taken off. Bones and meat for stock must be broken 
into small pieces. Cold water should be used, and a little 
salt to extract the nutriment. The whole must be brought 
slowly to the boiling point; then, the temperature lowered, the 
fat and scum taken off. When wanted for clear soups the 
vegetables should be cleaned, but not cut up, or with the 
long cooking they may mash and thicken the soup. In hot 
weather it is better to leave out the vegetables, as the stock 
turns sour more quickly if vegetables have been used in its 
preparation. They can be cooked separately and added 
when using the stock. 

The soup should simmer for five or six hours to extract 
the gelatinous matters. If the stock is skimmed occasionally 
it will be much clearer. Keep the lid on the stock pot to pre- 




Soups 

vent loss by evaporation. The bones can be cooked again 
next day for a second stock, but the vegetables must be taken 
out. Care must be taken that nothing doubtful in freshness be 
put into the stock pot. Meat and bones should be well wiped 
with a damp cloth before using them. If onions be put in the 
soup unpeeled, simply washed and the root end cut off, they 
will help to color the soup. When using eggs for other dishes, 
if the shells be washed before breaking them and added to 
the stock pot they will help to clear the soup. For clear soups 
care must be taken that nothing of a floury nature be added 
to the stock pot. Stock always should be strained before 
cooling. Never allow it to stand in stock pot all night. Clear 
gravy soup consists of the extractives, flavoring matters, and 
gelatine of meat and bones. 

Consomme is a good stock made from beef, veal, and often 
fowl, and flavored with vegetables, cooled, freed from fat. 
It is clarified with whites and shells of eggs, and chopped 
raw lean beef, and strained through a cloth. It should be 
brilliantly clear and of a pale brown color. Any fat floating 
on the stock may be removed by passing a piece of kitchen or 
blotting paper over the surface. Soup left from a meal will 
keep better if strained from the vegetables that have been 
served in it. In hot weather, stock left over must be boiled 
each day, and poured into a clean basin to prevent its turning 
sour. In warm weather, soups with milk in their composition 
should have a pinch of baking soda added. 

Thickenings for soup consist usually of yolks of eggs and 
cream beaten together in a basin, the boiling soup poured on 
slowly, stirring well at the same time. Soups thus thickened 
should not be allowed to boil again, otherwise they will 
curdle. Instead of eggs and cream, cornstarch and milk may be 
used to thicken the soup. 

Asparagus Soup 

40 heads asparagus 1 bay leaf 

3 tablespoonfuls flour 4 sprigs parsley 

3 tablespoonfuls Crisco 2 egg yolks 

}4 cupful cream 1 blade mace 

1 quart white stock Salt and white pepper to taste

Take heads off asparagus, and put aside. Cut up stalks in slices, also 
onion, put these into saucepan with Crisco, herbs, parsley, bay leaf, and 
mace, and fry gently for fifteen minutes, add flour, then stock, and simmer 
slowly for 1^ hours. Rub through sieve, add cream, yolks of eggs, and sea- 
sonings, reheat, but take care not to boil soup. Just before serving throw 
in asparagus tops, which should be first cooked in a little boiling stock.

Blend Crisco and flour together in saucepan over fire, add milk and 
bring to boiling point. Heat tomato juice, tomato catsup and add soda 
and seasonings. Just before serving add Crisco mixture to tomato juice 
and stir till boiling. Serve hot. Another method, is to cook 1 quart can 
of tomatoes with 1 quart of water twenty minutes, then rub through 
sieve. Blend 2 tablespoonfuls Crisco with 2 tablespoonfuls flour, add 1 
tablespoonful sugar, salt, pepper, and red pepper to taste, and 1 table- 
spoonful tomato catsup. Add pinch of baking soda to tomatoes, then add 
gradually to Crisco mixture. Just bring to boiling point and serve with

Fish Soup 

1 lb. cod, or other white fish 3 parsley sprigs 

2 tablespoonfuls Crisco 1 blade mace 

1 quart white stock, or half 2 egg yolks — 

milk and half water ^ cupful cream 

1 small carrot 1 lemon 

1 small onion 2 tablespoonfuls flour 

1 stalk celery 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley 

Dry toast 

Wash and dry fish and cut into small pieces. Put into saucepan with 
stock, vegetables cut in small pieces, parsley and mace. Let these simmer 
for half hour, then strain off liquid. Melt Crisco in pan, stir in flour, 
then add fish liquor and stir till it boils. Draw it to the side of fire and let 
cool slightly. Beat yolks of eggs with cream, and, when soup has cooled, 
strain them in. Reheat soup without boiling it, to cook eggs. Season, 
and add few drops lemon juice and chopped parsley. Serve with small 
pieces of dry toast.

Soups 

Lentil Soup 

1 cupful lentils 2 stalks celery 

2 cupfuls milk 1 tablespoonful flour 

3 tablespoonfuls Crisco 1 bay leaf 

3 pints stock or water Salt and pepper to taste 

1 onion }^ cupful cream 

1 carrot Croutons 

Wash lentils; soak twenty-four hours; drain well. Cut onion, carrot 
and celery into small pieces, then put them into a saucepan with Crisco, 
cover, and cook gently for fifteen minutes. Add stock and simmer 2 hours, 
then rub through sieve. Return to pan, add milk, seasonings, and bring 
to boil. Moisten flour with yi cupful milk or stock, add it to soup and 
simmer five minutes. Season to taste and add cream. Serve with croutons 
of fried or toasted bread. 

Lentils are a small leguminous seed, not so generally known as beans, 
but an excellent nitrogenous food, containing about 25 per cent, protein, 
more than 50 per cent, starch, with over 2 per cent. fat. They are not 
used as much as they ought to be. 

Croutons are made by cutting bread into tiny cubes and browning 
through and through in hot oven or putting into a frying pan with 2 table- 
spoonfuls Crisco and browning well. If latter is used great care must be 
used as the croutons will brown easily. 

Lobster Bisque 

1 can lobster H cupful Crisco 

1 cupful breadcrumbs Salt, pepper, red pepper, and 

1 quart milk grated nutmeg to taste 

1 quart water Squares fried bread 

1 tablespoonful flour Thin lemon slices 

Open a can of lobster of good quality, take out best pieces and cut 
into small squares without tearing; put them aside. Place remains of 
lobster in mortar or basin, and pound quite smooth with Crisco. Soak 
bread in water, adding flour, and seasonings, and put all on fire in soup 
pot with pounded lobster and Crisco; stir till it boils, and boil for fifteen 
minutes; then pass it through sieve, add milk and pieces of lobster, and 
return to the pot till it boils up. Serve with small squares of fried bread, 
and send thin slices of lemon to table with it. This is an excellent soup, 
and can of course be made with fresh lobster. 

Norfolk Puree 

}4 cupful barley, pearl 4 tablespoonfuls cooked carrot 

1 quart water balls 

3 pints white stock 4 tablespoonfuls cooked peas 

}4 cupful cream Salt, pepper, and paprika to 

1 yolk of egg taste 

2 tablespoonfuls Crisco Diced toast or fried bread 

Put barley into saucepan of cold water, bring to boil, let boil five min- 
utes, then drain off" water; this removes the slightly bitter taste. Now 
put barley into saucepan with Crisco and water, let these boil gently until 

49 



Soups 

barley is tender, drain, and rub through sieve. Add stock to this puree 
and let simmer ten minutes. Beat yolk of egg with cream and when soup 
has cooled slightly, strain them in. Stir soup over fire a few minutes to 
reheat; but be careful that it does not boil, or it will curdle. Season care- 
fully, add carrot balls and peas, which should first be heated in a little 
stock or water. Serve with dice of toast or fried bread. If you do not 
possess a round vegetable cutter, cut the carrot into small dice. This is a 
particularly nourishing soup. If you prefer a slightly cheaper variety, 
use milk instead of cream, and if you have no white stock use milk and 
water in equal proportions instead, and cook a carrot, turnip and onion 
in milk and water for twenty or thirty minutes. 

Soup Verte 

4 tablespoonfuls flour 1 bunch parsley 

3 tablespoonfuls Crisco 1 teaspoonful sugar 

2 quarts stock 2 egg yolks .

oughly washed; let all boil twenty minutes; strain, rubbing puree through 
sieve. Return it all to saucepan, add Crisco and flour mixed together 
with cupful of water, sugar and strained juice of a quarter of lemon. Let 
boil five minutes. Beat yolks of eggs with }4 cupful water, add them 
gradually to soup off^ fire, and stir near fire until cooked. Soup must not 
boil after yolks are added. Season with salt and pepper and serve. 

Thick Rice Soup 

2 pints water or stock 2 tablespoonfuls Crisco 
Salt and pepper to taste 1 cupful rice 

2 small onions 1 cupful canned tomatoes,

F 



ISH, though not quite so nutritious or 
so stimulating as butcher's meat, is an 
excellent article of diet, as it is light and 
easy of digestion and well suited to deli- 
cate persons and those following sedentary occupations, who 
generally do not take exercise in the fresh air. Fish contains 
a fair proportion of flesh forming and mineral matter, and the 
white kinds very little fat, hence their value in a sick diet. A 
few fishes are rich in fat, as salmon, mackerel, eels, and her- 
rings; they are more satisfying as a meal, but usually more 
difl^cult to digest, except the latter, which is fairly easy to 
digest, and, being inexpensive, forms an economical food. 

The digestibility will vary also with the quality of the 
fish and the methods of cooking. White fish when boiled is 
improved by being rubbed over with a cut lemon, or by adding 
a little vinegar to the water in which it is cooked to keep it 
white and firm. The fish should be put into hot, not boiling 
water, otherwise the higher temperature contracts the skin 
too quickly, and it breaks and looks unsightly. Salt fish may 
be placed in cold water, then boiled to extract some of the 
salt; if the fish has been salted and dried, it is better to soak 
it in cold water for about twelve hours before cooking. 

Fish to be fried should be cooked in sufficient hot Crisco 
to well cover it, after having been dried and covered with 
batter, or with beaten egg and breadcrumbs. To egg and 
breadcrumb fish put a slice into seasoned flour, turning it so 
that both sides may be covered. Shake off^ all loose flour. 
Brush fish over with beaten egg. Raise fish out of egg with 
the brush and a knife, drain off^ egg for a second, and lay fish 
in crumbs. Toss these all over it, lift out fish, shake off all 
loose crumbs, lay the slice on a board, and press crumbs down, 
so that surface is flat. The thicker the fish the more slowly it 
must be fried after the first two 

minutes, or it will be raw inside - - -^rvsrJ 

when the outside is done. 



Fish 

To bone fish. The process of boning is known as filleting 
and is generally done by the fish dealer, but when this is not 
the case the single rule for boning must be strictly adhered to 
in order to keep the knife on the bone — lifting the flesh with 
the left hand while the knife slips in between the bone and the 
flesh. Flat fish are divided down the middle of each side well 
into the bone, and the boning is begun at either side of the 
incision. Round fish are cut down the back, the flesh is laid 
open from one side and the bone is removed from the other. 
Occasionally round fish are boned readily, the whole fish 
minus the bones being returned to its proper shape, as in 
anchovies, sardines, herrings, haddocks, etc., in this case 
the fish would be split down the front, not the back, and 
stitched together after boning. 

Fish stock is made from the bones, skin and trimmings 
of white fish. These are broken small and generally flavored 
with onion, parsley, herbs, and seasonings. The proportion 
of water used is rather larger, as the flavor is much stronger 
and also more easily extracted than from meat. 

Baked Halibut 

2 lbs. halibut 2 tablespoonfuls Crisco 

1 cupful tomatoes ^ teaspoonful salt 

2 tablespoonfuls flour ^ teaspoonful pepper 

Clean fish, season with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, place in

Salt, pepper, and red pepper 2 cupfuls fish stock, or milk 
to taste and water 

For fish. Mix Crisco with shallot, gherkin, anchovy, and seasonings, 
lay salmon in this mixture and let it "marinade," as it is called, for one 
hour. At the end of that time lift it out; do not shake off any ingredients 
that are sticking to it. Now lay it in a well Criscoed fireproof dish, cover 
it with a greased paper, and bake in moderate oven for thirty minutes. 
For sauce. Melt Crisco in small saucepan, stir in flour, add fish 
stock and stir until it boils and thickens. Rub anchovies through fine 
sieve, and add with seasonings. Serve in hot tureen with fish.

Dressed Crab 

1 good sized heavy crab 2 tablespoonfuls vinegar 

6 tablespoonfuls Crisco 1 tablespoonful chopped parsley 

2 tablespoonfuls breadcrumbs Crisp lettuce leaves 

3 tablespoonfuls olive oil Salt and pepper to taste 

If possible choose a crab with large claws. Boil crab in boiling salted 
water for thirty minutes, take up and break off large and small claws; 
Lay crab on its back, pull back the flap under its body, pull it right out 
and commence to remove flesh from shell. Take care that the little bag 
near head, usually full of sand, is taken out. Throw away all bone and 
finny pieces. The flesh is of two kinds, some firm and white, rest soft and 
dark. Separate former into little shreds with a fork, also the white meat 
from claws, which must be cracked in order to obtain it. Mix dark soft 
substance with crumbs, add oil, vinegar, and seasonings to taste. Toss

A.T-S J 





lOOKERY is a branch of applied 
chemistry. To cook anything, in 
the narrower sense of the term, 
means to bring about changes in 
it by submitting it to the action of heat, and usually of 
moisture also, which will make it more fitted for food ; and it is on 
the nature of this action on different materials that the rational 
of the cook's art chiefly depends. Good cooking can make any 
meat tender, and bad cooking can make any meat tough. 

The substance in meat called albumen becomes tougher 
and more indigestible, the higher the temperature to which 
it is subjected reaches beyond a certain point. It is this 
effect of heat on albumen, therefore, which has to be con- 
sidered whenever the cooking of meat is in question, and 
which mainly determines the right and the wrong, whether 
in the making of a soup or a custard, the roasting or boiling 
of a chicken or a joint, or the frying of a cutlet or an omelet. 

We now will see to begin with, what are the special ways 
in which it bears on meat cookery. Take a little bit of raw 
meat and put it in cold water. The juice gradually soaks 
out of it, coloring the water pink and leaving the meat nearly 
white. Now take another bit, and pour boiling water upon 
it; and though no juice can be seen escaping, the whole sur- 
face of the meat turns a whitish color directly. 

Lean meat is made up of bundles of hollow fibres within 
which the albuminous juices are stored. Wherever these 
fibres are cut through, the juice oozes out and spreads itself 
over the surface of the meat. If, as in our first little experi- 
ment, the meat is put in cold water, or even in warm water, 
or exposed to a heat insufficient to set the albumen, either 
in an oven or before the fire, the albuminous juices are in the 
first case drawn out and dissolved, and in the second evapo- 
rated. In either case the meat is deprived of them. But if the 



Meats 

meat is put into boiling water or into a quick oven or before 
a hot fire, the surface albumen is quickly set, forms a tough 
white coating which effectually plugs the ends of the cut 
fibres, and prevents any further escape of their contents. 

Here, then, we have the first principles on which meat 
cookery must be conducted; viz: that if we wish to get the 
juices out of the meat, as for soups and stews, the liquid in 
which we put it must be cold to begin with; while if we wish, 
as for boiled or roast meat, to keep them in, the meat must be 
subjected first of all to the action of boiling water, a hot fire 
or a quick oven. The meats of soups and stews must not be 
raw, and that of joints must not be tough; and the cooking 
of both one and the other, however it is begun, should be 
completed at just such a moderate temperature as will set, 
but not harden, the albumen. That is to say, the soup or 
stew must be raised to this temperature, after the meat juices 
have been drawn out by a lower one, while a joint or fowl 
must be lowered to it after the surface albumen has been 
hardened by a higher one. 

All poultry or game for roasting should be dredged with 
flour before and after trussing, to dry it perfectly, as other- 
wise it does not crisp and brown so well. Unless poultry is to 
be boiled or stewed it never should be washed or wet in any 
way as this renders the flesh sodden and the skin soft. Good 
wiping with clean cloths should be quite sufficient. With the 
exception of ducks and geese, all poultry and game require 
rather a large addition of fat during roasting, as the flesh is 
dry. Chickens will cook in from twenty to thirty minutes; 
fowls take from thirty to sixty minutes when young and 
tender, the only condition in which they are fit to roast; 
turkeys take from one to two hours and even more if excep- 
tionally large. Game takes longer in proportion to its size 
than poultry, and all birds require better and more cooking 
than beef or mutton.

N the vegetable kingdom the cereals 
form a very important part of our diet, 
by supplying cniefly the carbohydrates 
or heat giving matter. Another nutritious 
group termed pulse, are those which have 
their seed enclosed in a pod. The most familiar are peas, 
beans, and lentils; peas and beans are eaten in the green or 
unripe state as well as in the dried. Vegetables included in 
the pulse group are very nourishing if they can be digested, 
they contain a large amount of flesh forming matter, usually 
a fair amount of starch, but are deficient in fat. Peas and 
beans also contain sulphur and tend to produce flatulence when 
indulged in by those of weak digestion. Lentils contain less 
sulphur, and do not produce this complaint so readily. 

The more succulent vegetables include tubers, as potatoes 
and Jerusalem artichokes, leaves, stems, and bulbs, as cab- 
bages, spinach, celery, and onions, roots and flowers, as car- 
rots, parsnips, and cauliflower. These are very valuable on 
account of the mineral matter, chief of which are the potash 
salts, so necessary to keep the blood in a healthy condition. 

Care should be taken in cooking vegetables not to lose the 
salts. Steaming is preferable to boiling, by preserving the 
juices, though it does not tend to improve the color of green 
vegetables. A little lemon juice added to the water in which 
new potatoes are boiling improves their color. Mint is some- 
times cooked with new potatoes. To secure a good color in 
vegetables when cooked, careful cleaning and preparation 
before cooking is essential. Earthy roots, such as potatoes, 
turnips, and carrots, must be both well scrubbed and thor- 
oughly rinsed in clean water before peeling. From all vege- 
tables, coarse or discolored leaves and any dark or decayed 
spots should be carefully removed before cooking. 

Potatoes should be peeled thinly, or, if new, merely 
brushed or rubbed with a coarse cloth to get the skin off. 



FegetabUf 

Turnips should be thickly peeled, as the rind in these is hard 
and woody. Carrots and salsify, unless very old, need scraping 
only. After the removal of the skin, all root vegetables 
(except those of the onion kind) should be put in cold water

ALADS are classified into two groups — 
i.e., the raw, such as lettuce, endive, 
radishes, cucumber, celery, etc., and 
the cooked, such as those made from 
cooked vegetables, eggs, cooked cold fish, poultry, and meat. 
The raw materials should be washed most carefully and well 
cleaned before mixing, and the utensils for cutting and mixing, 
as well as the basins or bowls used, should be clean and dry. 
Every salad, no matter how plain and sirnple it may be, should 
be made to look inviting and tempting. The method of drain- 
ing or drying is a very easy performance so long as the salad 
leaves, whatever they may be, are almost free from moisture. 
This is eflPected best by putting the leaves, which should be 
broken, not cut with a knife, into a wire basket and drying 
them well, or else putting them into a cloth lightly folded and 
shaking well until the outer moisture of the leaves is well 
absorbed. The salad then is ready for mixing. 

Any cold boiled vegetables left over from dinner are use- 
ful as giving variety to salads, and help to make a good 
accompaniment to cold meat served to luncheon. Thinly 
sliced cold potatoes — new ones for choice, green peas and string 
beans, are especially good for this purpose, and even Brussels 
sprouts, carrots, and turnips may be used on occasion in small 
quantities. More substantial salads, prepared with cold meat 
or fish, form appetizing luncheon or breakfast dishes. Those 
made with chicken, lobster and salmon respectively are most 
widely known, but fillets of flounder, cold ham or beef, or 
lamb make very good salads, and even the humble herring, 
and dried and salted fish, may be used with advantage in 
this way. 

The meat or fish should be cut up into cubes or convenient 
small pieces, and piled up in the center of the dish or 
salad bowl on a layer of seasoned, shredded lettuce. Over 
this should be poured half of the dressing. 
Round this should be arranged the green j|l

Salads 

constituents of the salad, cut up rather small, garnished 
with slices of tomato or beets, cucumber and hard-cooked egg. 
The remainder of the dressing should be poured over this, and 
the top of the meat or fish pyramid may be ornamented with a 
few sprigs of endive or parsley.

FIUPPM©, 





^UDDINGS as a rule either are boiled, 
steamed or baked. For boiled pud- 
dings, care should be taken that the 
saucepan be kept boilingor the water 
will get into the pudding and spoil it. For 
pudding cloths, use materials such as linen 
or cheese cloth. After using, the cloth must be thoroughly 
washed in plenty of water with a little washing soda, but on 
no account use soap, and see that the cloth is perfectly dry 
before patting it away. Many puddings are lighter and better 
steamed, and then instead of the cloth only a piece of Criscoed 
paper is required, twisted over the top of the basin or mold. 
Very light puddings, such as custards, should be placed in a 
steamer. Most of the steamed puddings mixed a little softer, 
are excellent baked in a pudding dish. 

In steaming puddings keep them at a uniform heat all 
the time, and be careful not to lift the Hd off the pan for the 
first half hour. All farinaceous puddings should be cooked 
well, as then they are easier to digest. Cornstarch must 
be well cooked, from eight to ten minutes. Mold for jellies 
or blanc-manges should be well rinsed with cold water before 
using. Baiters must be well beaten and allowed to stand for 
thirty minutes or longer before cooking, because the starch 
in the flour swells, and the batter will therefore be lighter. 
Batter puddings should be put into a quick oven. Puddings 
composed principally of milk and eggs should be very gently 
cooked, as strong heat will cause them to curdle. 

In stewing fruit, prepare syrup first. Bring to boil, lay 
fruit in, and simmer gently. SouflHes should be very light 
and spongy. Eggs form a large part of souffles, more whites 
than yolks are used and the former are beaten to a stiff froth. 
All souffles should be served quickly. Omelets are com- 
posed mainly of eggs. They can be savory or sweet. If over- 
cooked an omelet will be tough. To prevent milk running 



Puddingi

slices with batter and drop them into plenty of CriscO heated so that small

for apples or a combination of fruits makes a delicious fritter.

F the slices of bread have to be spread 
with butter or with a paste it should 
be done before they are cut off. The 
slices should not be cut thicker than an 
eighth of an inch. When butter is used there must just be 
enough of it for us to know in some mysterious fashion that 
it is there. Every scrap of a sandwich should he eatable. 
Sandwiches usually are served on folded napkins, and arranged 
in circles, so that one overlaps the other. It is well to lay 
a damp napkin over the sandwiches, if they are not wanted 
immediately, in order to keep them moist. To make superior 
sandwich butter, work one cupful of butter in a basin with a 
clean and dry wooden spoon until soft; then add by degrees 
half a cupful of whipped cream, seasoning of salt and mustard, 
and put it in a cool place until required.

FA-Q^TIEH 





HERE are two principal divisions, 
within which all varieties may be in- 
cluded, viz: 

1. Short or plain pastries. 

2. Flaky pastries. 

Of these, the former includes all pastes in which the fat is 
mixed evenly with the dough throughout; the latter, those in 
which, by one means or another, the two are arranged in 
alternate layers. The short pastes are the simplest, and for 
this reason should be experimented on to begin with. With 
pastry, a good deal always depends on the mixing. The best 
way is to measure out the average quantity of liquid, to pour 
about three-quarters of this gradually into the flour, at the same 
time stirring this briskly with a knife, so as to get it evenly moist- 
ened, and then add, in very small quantities at a time, as much 
more water as may be needed. To see, in this way, when the 
flour has been moistened enough, is easy. By the time the 
first three parts of water have been put in, most of it will have 
stuck together in little separate rolls; if on pressing these they 
should not only cling together, but readily collect about them 
whatever loose flour there may be, suflftcient moisture will have 
been added; but so long as the mixture, when pressed, remains 
to some degree crumbly, it is a sign that a little more water is 
required. When done, the paste should stick together, but 
should not adhere either to the hands or to the basin. If it 
does this it is too wet, and more flour must be dusted over it 
and kneadfed in till the surplus moisture has been absorbed. 
A sure sign of its having been mixed properly is when it can be 
rolled into a lump, and the basin wiped out cleanly with it, as 
with a cloth. To roll out, flour the pastry board slightly, lay 
the dough on it, and form it into a neat, flat oblong 
sh'kpe. (^y\. 



^^a^scea^

Pastries 

Press it out first a little with the roller, and then roll with 
short, quick strokes to the thickness required. Always roll 
straight forwards, neither sideways nor obliquely. If the paste 
wants widening, alter its position, not the direction of the roll- 
ing. At the beginning of each stroke, bring the roller rather 
sharply down, so as to drive out the paste in front of it, and 
take especial care in rolling to stop always just short of the 
edges. Short pastry differs from the flaky pastries in requiring 
but one rolling out. 

It should be handled and rolled as little as possible and 
when carefully made it should not be in the least leathery or 
tough. Air in this method is mixed equally throughout the 
paste, and when it expands in the oven raises the paste in all 
directions. The flakiness of pastry depends upon the kind 
and amount of shortening used. Crisco makes tenderer crust 
than either lard or butter. Make pastry in a cool atmosphere 
and on a cool surface. The lightness of pastry depends 
largely upon the light handling in blending the Crisco with 
the flour and in the rolling of the pastry upon the board. 
The best results are obtained by cutting the Crisco into the 
flour with a knife. 

If pastry contains baking powder it should be put into 
the oven as quickly as possible, but if it contains a liberal 
sup\)ly of Crisco without baking powder, it improves by being 
set aside in a cool place a few hours. Pastry that is light, 
dry and flaky, is separated more easily by the gastric fluids 
than that which is heavy. The flour must be of good 
quality, fine and dry. All pastry requires to be placed in a 
hot oven, slightly hotter for flaky than short crust. The 
oven should register from 310° F. to 340° F. The great heat 
quickly will cause the starch grains to burst and absorb the 
fat, otherwise the pastry will be heavy. 

In making flaky pastry, if it has been rolled and folded 
properly, and not allowed to stick to the board, nor cut so 
that air can pass through layers, this air when heated in the 
oven expands and raises the paste in layers or puffs. Heat of 
oven must be great enough to fix the pastry in this raised 
condition, and as cold air prevents this, the oven door must 
not be opened too soon, or any more than necessary. See 
that the oven is clean.

Plain Crisco Pastry 



IM cupfuls flour ya teaspoonful salt 

}4 cupful Crisco Cold water 

Sift flour and salt and cut Crisco into flour with knife until finely 
divided. Finger tips may be used to finish blending materials. Add gradu- 
ally sufficient water to make stiflF paste. Water should be added sparinglyand 
mixed with knife through dry ingredients. Form lightly and quickly with 
hand into dough; roll out on slightly floured board, about one-quarter inch 
thick. Use light motion in handling rolling-pin, and roll from center outward. 

Sufficient for one small pie. 

The New Crisco Pastry 

2 cupfuls flour 1 tablespoonful lemon juice 

fi cupful Crisco Sufficient cold water to hold 

1 egg mixture together 

^ teaspoonful salt 

Sift flour and salt into basin. Flour blade of knife, and chop Crisco 
into flour, being careful to keep flour between blade of knife and shorten- 
ing. When mixture looks like meal, add gradually, egg well beaten and 
mixed with lemon juice. Roll pastry into ball with knife. May be used 
at once, but will be improved if allowed to stand in cool place for one hour. 
Should be rolled out once and handled as lightly as possible. May be used 
for sweet or savory dishes. Bake in hot oven. The purpose of the addition 
of lemon is to render gluten of flour more ductile, so that it will stretch 
rather than break as paste is rolled out, or as it rises in oven. 

Sufficient for two pies.

Then add water sparingly, mixing it with knife through dry materials. 
Form with the hand into dough and roll out on a floured board to quarter 
inch thickness. Spread one-third of remaining Crisco on two-thirds of 
dough nearest you; fold twice, to make three layers, folding in first that 
part on which Crisco has not been spread. Turn dough, putting folded 
edges to the sides; roll out, spread and fold as before. Repeat once more. 
Use a light motion in handling rolling-pin, and roll from center outward. 
Should Crisco be too hard, it will not mix readily with flour, in which case 
the result will be a tough crust. 

Sufficient for two covered pies. 

Flake Pastry No. 2 

}4 teaspoonful salt l4 cupful Crisco 

2 cupfuls flour Cold water 

Mix salt with flour; divide Crisco into four equal parts, rub in one 
of these only, and then mix to stiff paste with a little cold water. Shape 
into neat oblong piece, and roll into straight strip about three times as 
long as it is broad. All over this put on, with the point of knife, one of 
remaining quarters of Crisco, distributing it evenly in little dabs about 
size of a pea, so that they look like buttons on a card. Now flour surface 
lightly and fold paste exactly in three by taking hold of the two bottom 
corners and doubling them upwards from you and then of the top corners 
and doubling them downwards towards you. Turn now at right angles to 
its former position so as to have open ends pointing towards you. Press 
these quickly together with the roller to inclose some air, and press paste 
across also in two or three places, making little ridges, thus preventing air 
which has been shut in, from forming into large bubble. Roll out again, 
and repeat till remaining two parts of Crisco have thus been used. At 
the last rolling, bring to required thickness; and if it needs widening as 
well as lengthening, turn it at right angles to its former position, and roll 
straight across it as before, a rule which, with flaky pastry, should always 
be observed, since, unlike the short pastries, its lightness suff^ers if rolled 
obliquely to the direction in which it has been folded. 

Sufficient for two small pies. 

Puff Pastry 

1 teaspoonful salt 1 yolk of egg 

1 cupful Crisco 2 teaspoonfuls lemon juice 

2 cupfuls flour Cold water 

Measure Crisco and set in cold place to chill it. Sift flour and salt into 
basin, and add lemon juice. Take a quarter of the Crisco, and rub it 
lightly into flour with finger tips until there are no lumps left. Beat yolk 
of egg and add a little cold water, then add them to the flour, making them 
into a stiffish dough. Turn this on to floured board, and work well with 
hands until it will no longer stick to fingers and forms a perfectly smooth 
dough. Form into oblong piece and roll out to about half inch thickness. 
The Crisco to be used should be as nearly as possible of same consistency 
as the paste. 

Form it into neat flat cake, and place in center of pastry. Fold up 
rather loosely, and flat the folds with rolling-pin. Place in refrigerator for 
ten minutes. Then roll out pastry into long narrow strip, being careful 

92 



Pastries 

that Crisco does not get through. Fold exactly in three, press down folds, 
and lay aside in cool place or in refrigerator fifteen minutes. This is called 
giving the pastry one "turn" and seven of these is the number required 
for this pastry. The next time the pastry is rolled, place it with the joins 
at your right hand side, and open ends towards you. Give two "turns" 
this time, and again set aside in cool place for at least fifteen minutes. 
Repeat this until pastry has had seven rolls in all. The object of the 
cooling between the rolls is to keep Crisco and flour in distinct and sep- 
arate layers, in which it is the function of the rolling-pin and folding to 
arrange them, and on which the lightness of the pastry depends. 

When rolling, keep the pressure of the two hands as equal as possible. 
If the pastry becomes rounded, it shows that there is more pressure being 
done on the rounded side than the other. After it has received its last roll, 
it is better to be laid aside before using, then rolled to the thickness re- 
quired. 

Sufficient for two pies. 

Rough Puff Pastry 

2 cupfuls flour 1 teaspoonful lemon juice 

yi cupful Crisco, generous measure 1 egg 
}4 teaspoonful salt Cold water 

Have Crisco cold and firm. Sift flour and salt into basin, add Crisco 
and cut into pieces one inch square. Beat up egg, add lemon juice and a 
very little cold water, then add them gradually into other ingredients 
making them into a stiff paste. Roll in a long piece on floured board, 
fold in three, turn rough edges toward you and roll out again, continuing 
this for five times. Place in refrigerator or in cool place ten nfinutes be- 
tween each rolling. This pastry may be used at once for all kinds of sweet 
or savory pies, but it is improved by standing for a few hours in a cool 
place. Bake in hot oven. Sufficient for two covered pies.

AP J ^€ 




IHE usual method of making bread is to fer- 
ment dough with yeast; the latter acts upon 
certain constituents in the flour ultimately 
producing a gas which permeates the dough. 
The dough is placed in a very hot oven, the heat kills the 
yeast plant, the gas expands with the heat, still raising the 
dough. The loaf is set in shape, and, when finally cooked 
and the gas all escaped, will be found to be light and full of 
tiny holes. Certain factors hasten or delay these changes. 
A moist, warm medium being most favorable to the growth 
of the yeast, the water should just be lukewarm; then a 
good flour, containing about 8 per cent of gluten is neces- 
sary. This gluten is the proteid in flour; when well 
mixed with water it forms a viscid elastic substance, hence 
it is necessary to well knead dough to make it more springy, 
so that when the gas is generated in it, it will expand and take 
the form of a sponge, and thus prevent the gas from escaping. 
The bread must be put into a very hot oven at first, 340° F., 
so that the yeast plant is killed quickly. If this be not ac- 
complished soon, the loaf may go on spreading in the oven, 
and, if not sour in taste, will not be of such a good flavor. 

Plenty of salt in dough is said to strengthen the gluten, 
give a good flavor to the bread, and keep it moist for a longer 
time, but it rather retards the working of the yeast. Flour also 
may be made into a light loaf by using baking powder to pro- 
duce the gas. This is a much quicker process, but the bread 
is not liked so universally as when made with yeast. For, when 
yeast is used, other changes take place in the dough besides the 
production of the gas, that seem to give bread the character- 
istic flavor constantly welcome by the palate. Good flour 
has a slight pure smell, free from any moldy odor. 

Yeast is a fungoid growth, a microscropic plant capable 
of starting a fermentation in various substances. It grows 



Breads, etc. 

rapidly in a favorable medium, as when mixed with flour 
and water, and kept in a warm place, resulting in setting up 
fermentation. Baking powders are composed of an acid and 
an alkali. Some kind of flour usually is added to keep them 
dry and free from lumps. When the mixture containing the 
baking powder is moistened the acid and the alkali chemically 
combine and alter, a gas being generated. If the articles, be 
placed soon in great heat, the gas is warmed, expands, and 
in its endeavor to escape raises the mass. The heat sets 
the mixture in this raised condition, thus the cake or pudding 
is rendered light, easier to masticate and digest. 

Baking powders are used for two reasons. First. To sup- 
ply a gas to take the place of ingredients, as when used in 
making bread, buns, etc. If flour, salt and water were mixed 
and baked in a large loaf, it would be a hard, indigestible 
mass. If baking powder be mixed in with similar ingredients 
and baked, the result would be a light loaf, easy to masti- 
cate and digest. 

Second. It is used to save labor. When a richer mixture 
be made it requires to be well beaten to mix in air. Baking 
powder often is added to save some of the otherwise neces- 
sary beating. 

Baking Powder Biscuits 

2 cupfuls flour *2 teaspoonfuls baking powder 

2 tablespoonfuls Crisco 1 teaspoonful salt 

Milk 

Mix and sift twice dry ingredients. Work in Crisco with finger tips, 
add gradually milk, mixing with knife to soft dough. Toss on floured board; 
pat and roll to one-half inch thickness. Shape with biscuit cutter. Place 
on Criscoed tin and bake in hot oven twelve minutes. To have good bis- 
cuits dough should be handled as little as possible, just enough to get in 
shape to cut. Milk or water used for mixing should be very cold, and 
biscuits should be gotten into oven at once after adding liquid to flour. 
If top of each biscuit is lightly brushed over with melted Crisco before 
baking, crust will be much nicer. SuSicient for fifteen biscuits. 

•Amount of bakine powder may be increased if especially. raised biscuits are desired. 2 teaspoonfuls, 
bowrrer, is most healthful amount.

CAiCE 





I HERE are five principal ways of making 
cakes. 

The first method is used for plain 
cakes. The shortening is rubbed into 
the flour in the same way as for short pastry; then the dry 
ingredients, such as sugar, fruit, and spice, are added, and 
lastly the eggs and milk. Then all are mixed well together. 

The second way is used for fruit, pound, and seed cakes. 
The shortening and sugar are creamed together, the eggs 
beaten in one at a time, and the fruit and flour stirred in 
lightly and quickly at the last. 

In the third way the eggs and sugar are beaten together 
until thick and creamy, then the flour is stirred in lightly and 
quickly. This is used chiefly for sponge cakes and cakes of 
that texture. 

For the fourth way the sugar, shortening, milk, and syrup 
or molasses are melted together, then cooled slightly and 
added to the dry ingredients. This method is used for ginger- 
breads. 

In the fifth way the sugar and eggs are beaten thor- 
oughly over boiling water, then cooled before the melted short- 
ening and dry ingredients are added. This method is used for 
Gennoise cake and some kinds of layer cakes. Care must be 
taken to insure the right consistency of cakes. The mixture 
should be fairly stiff". If too moist the fruit will sink to the 
bottom. For rich cakes the tins should be lined with paper, 
the paper coming a short distance above the tins, so that the 
cake is protected as it rises. For very rich fruit cakes, ex- 
perience has shown that it is best not to grease the paper or 
tin. The cake is not so liable to burn, and the paper can be 
removed easily when the cake is done without injuring it. 
On the other hand, if tins are lined for sponge cakes or jelly- 
rolls, the paper should be greased. 



Cakes 

When making cakes in which baking powder, carbonate 
of soda, cream of tartar or tartaric acid are used, almost 
everything depends upon the handling, which should be as 
light and as little as possible. The more rapidly such cakes 
are made the better they will be. Two cooks working from 
the same recipe will often produce entirely different results, 
if one kneads her mixture as if it were household bread, 
while the other handles it with due lightness of touch. As 
soon as the baking powder or other rising medium is added 
to the mixture, the cake should be put into the oven as quickly 
as possible. Soda alone is never good in a cake where there 
is shortening, unless some substance containing acid is used 
along with it. Molasses is one of the substances containing 
acid. 

The greatest care and cleanliness must be exercised in all 
cake making; and accuracy in proportioning the materials 
to be used is indispensable. The flour should be thoroughly 
dried and sifted, and lightly stirred in. Always sift flour 
before measuring, then sift it again with the baking powder 
to insure a thorough blending. 

Good cakes never can be made with indifferent materials. 
Eggs are used both as an aerating agent and as one of the 
"wetting" materials. It is not economy to buy cheap eggs, 
for such eggs are small, weak, colorless, and often very stale. 
Eggs should be well beaten, yolks and whites separately, 
unless other directions are given. The yolks must be beaten 
to a thick cream and the whites until they are a solid froth. 
Sugar tends to improve the texture of cakes, and when cheap 
cakes are made, plenty should be used, provided that the cake 
is not made too sweet. It should be dissolved before being 
added to the fat and the flour. 

For best cakes, and all that are required of a light color, 
fine-grained sugar should be used. With coarse-grained 
sugar there is danger of producing specks which show on the 
cakes after baking, unless they have been made by the method 
of beating up the eggs and sugar together with a beater over 
hot water. This method will dissolve the grains of sugar. 

Always buy the best fruits for cake making, as they are 
sweetest and cleanest. Currants and sultana raisins for cakes 
should not be too large, but of medium size, sweet and 
fleshy. Cheap dry sultanas should not be used. Though 
there is no need to wash sultanas, yet if the fruit is inclined 

116 



Cahes 

to be very dry, it will be better to do so than to put them 
in to spoil the appearance and the flavor of the cake. Cur- 
rants always should be washed, cleaned, and dried before 
using. Orange, lemon, and citron peel should be of good 
color and flavor. They should not be added to cake mixture 
in chunks, as often is done, but should be in long shredded 
pieces. Large pieces of peel are sometimes the cause of a 
cake cutting badly. In making fruit cakes add the fruit before 
the flour, as this will prevent it falling to the bottom. 

If a cake cracks open while baking, the recipe contains 
too much flour. There are two kinds of thick crusts which 
some cakes have. The first of these is caused by the cake 
being overbaked in a very hot oven. Where this is so, the 
cake, if a very rich one, has a huge crack in the top caused by 
the heat of the oven forming a crust before the inside has 
finished aerating; then as the interior air or gas expands, it 
cracks the crust to escape. This crack spoils the appearance 
of the cake, and when cut it generally will be found to be 
close and heavy in texture. To guard against this it is nec- 
essary to bake them at a suitable temperature, noting that the 
richer the cake the longer the fruit takes to bake. 

The second kind of thick crust referred to may only be 
on top of the cake, and in this case may be caused by an 
excess of .fat and sugar being mixed together, or otherwise 
insufllicient flour. In this case the mixture will not bake, 
but only forms a kind of syrup in the oven, and the cake sinks 
in the center. A cake made under such conditions would have 
a thick shiny crust, and be liable to crumble when touched. 
The inside of the cake would be heavy, having more the ap-, 
pearance of pudding than cake. 

Successful cake making means constant care. In recipes 
in which milk is used as one ingredient, either sweet or butter- 
milk may be used but not a mixture of both. Buttermilk 
makes a light, spongy cake, and sweet milk makes a cake 
which cuts like pound cake. In creaming shortening and 
sugar, when the shortening is too hard to blend easily warm the 
bowl slightly, but do not heat the shortening, as this will change 
both the flavor and texture of the cake. For small cakes have a 
quick oven, so that they set right through, and the inside 
is baked by the time the outside is browned. For all large 
cakes have a quick oven at first, to raise them nicely and 
prevent the fruit sinking to the bottom. The oven then should 
be allowed to become slower to fire the cakes thoroughly. 

117 



Cakes 

Cake must not be hurried. Keep the oven steady though 
slow, and after putting a large cake into it do not open the 
door for at least twenty minutes. During baking, do not 
open the door unnecessarily, or in fact do anything to jar the 
cake lest the little bubbles formed by the action of the baking 
powder burst, causing the gas to escape and the cake to sink. 
This produces what is known as a "sad" cake, but refers 
probably to the state of mind of the cook. A very light 
cake put into a quick oven rises rapidly round the sides, but 
leaves a hollow in the middle. 

If a cake is made too light with eggs or powder and an 
insufficient quantity of flour is added it will drop in the center. 
Another frequent cause is the moving of cakes while in the 
oven before the mixture has set properly. The same defect 
is produced if the cakes are removed from the oven before 
being baked sufficiently. When a cake batter curdles, the 
texture will not be so even as if the curdling had not taken 
place. Sometimes the mixture will curdle through the eggs 
being added too quickly, or if the shortening contains too 
much water. This forms a syrup with the sugar, and after a 
certain quantity of eggs have been added the batter will slip 
and slide about, and will not unite with the other in- 
gredients. Weak, watery eggs are another cause of this 
happening; and although this may be checked by adding a 
little flour at the right time, yet the cake would be better 
if it were unnecessary to add any flour until all the eggs haci 
been beaten in, that is, if the batter had not curdled. Before 
turning out a cake allow it to remain in the tin for a few min- 
utes. It is best to lay it on a wire cake stand, or lay it on 
a sieve; but if you do not possess these, a loosely made 
basket turned upside down will do. If the cake will not turn 
out of the tin easily, rest it on its side, turning it round in a 
couple of minutes and it may loosen, if not, pass a knife 
round the edge, turn the cake over on a clean cloth, and let 
it stand a few minutes. 

Do not place cakes in a cold place or at an open window, 
or the steam will condense and make them heavy, A rich 
cake improves in flavor and becomes softer with keeping 
(from 2 to 6 weeks, according to quality) before cutting. 
Wrap, when cold, first in a clean towel, then in paper. After 
a week remove the paper and put the cake into a tin wrapped 
in the towel. Small cakes may be baked in tiny molds or 
tins, or baked in a flat sheet, and then cut out into squares, 

118 



Cakes 

diamonds or rounds. Then they can be frosted or coated 
with cream and decorated with cherries or other crystalHzed 
fruits. If a real distinction is desired, they may be placed in 
tiny crinkled paper cases, bought by the hundred at a trifling 
cost. 

Cake tins should be greased with Crisco and dredged 
with flour, the superfluous flour shaken out, or they can be 
fitted with paper which has been greased with Crisco. When 
creaming Crisco and sugar, do not grudge hard work; at 
this stage of manufacture the tendency is to give insufficient 
work, with the result that the lightness of the cake is im- 
paired.

VI1©II¥AKIIAM 





E' 



'VEN those who are by no means 
decided vegetarians may be glad to 
pass over a dinner occasionally with- 
out meat. It is perhaps not too much to say that every 
housekeeper ought to be able to provide a meal without the 
aid of meat. We do not mean by this simply the cooking of 
vegetables or the preparations of puddings, but the presenta- 
tion of dishes intended to take the place of flesh, such as 
soups and broths made without meat, vegetable stews, lentil 
fritters and other healthful and nutritious dishes. A vegetarian 
menu is not so simple as it sounds. It requires knowledge 
and discrimination on the housekeeper's part to serve a solid 
meal without flesh or fowl. 

Now that meat is so dear it is the favorable moment to 
try a vegetable diet for a time. One mistake to be avoided 
in this catering is the putting down of too many dishes of a 
pulpy character — food which is soft is excellent with other 
things, but alone it is neither satisfying nor very nourishing, 
at least to a person of strong digestion. All of them should 
not be white, for instance, and the same rule holds good in 
other things besides color. A nice dish for this kind of diet 
is a vegetable curry, in which all the vegetables ?re treated 
like meat and turned out crisp; all the vegetables, too, must 
be fresh and young for this method of serving, so that any- 
thing like stringiness is absolutely impossible. 

Crisco is entirely vegetable. 

Bean Cutlets 



2 tablespoonfuls Crisco 
1 tablespoonful flour 
J^ cupful bean liquor 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Soak beans in water twenty-four hours, 
then boil for several hours till quite tender,

very fine; blend Crisco with flour in saucepan over fire, add bean liquor, 
beans, salt and pepper, and yolks of eggs; turn out on to a dish and set 
aside till cold. Then cut out with cutlet-cutter or shape with knife; dip 
in beaten whites of the eggs, then in fine breadcrumbs, repeat a second 
time, and fry in hot Crisco. Serve on hot platter decorated with a few 
hot cooked mixed vegetables. Sufficient for eight cutlets. 

Devilled Bananas 

2 tablespoonfuls Crisco 8 bananas 

}4 teaspoonful salt 1 teaspoonful chopped pickles 

Few grains red pepper, or 1 dessertspoonful chopped chillies 

Slice bananas, mix with salt, chopped pickles and red pepper or chop- 
ped chillies and put them into hot Crisco. Cook for four minutes and 
serve. Sufficient for eight bananas. 

Cauliflower Snow 

2 tablespoonfuls melted Crisco 4 poached eggs 

2 cauliflowers Salt and paprika to taste 

Toasted bread 

Boil cauliflowers in salted water till tender, then drain and set near 
fire till quite dry. Remove all green parts and press flower through a 
potato ricer upon a hot dish, on which they are to be served. In no way 
crush the mass as it falls from the ricer. Sprinkle over with melted Crisco. 
Surround dish with poached eggs, each laid upon square of toasted but- 
ered bread. Dust each egg with salt and a little paprika. Serve very hot. 

Craigie Toast

HEN there is any doubt as to the 
freshness of eggs, they may be tested 
in various ways. Quite fresh eggs will 
sink in a strong brine, and as they 
become stale they remain suspended at different depths in 
the brine, until an absolutely stale egg will float. Successful 
preservation depends in a great measure upon the condition 
of the egg at the time of preserving. Different methods of 
preserving all aim at the same thing, namely, at coating the 
porous shell with some substance which will prevent the air 
entering and setting up decomposition. See page 30. 

When used as food, eggs should be cooked at a low 
temperature — about 160° F., or if in the shell at about 180° F. 
The time varies with the size of the egg, from two and a half 
minutes for poaching a medium-sized egg to four and a half 
minutes for boiling a large one. If too much cooked, or at too 
high a temperature, the white becomes tough, hard, and to 
many people, indigestible. 

When required for salads, garnishing, etc., the eggs must 
be boiled from ten to twenty minutes, and if the yolks are to be 
powdered for sprinkling, they must be cooked for a longer time, 
or the centers will be somewhat tough and elastic, and useless 
for the purpose. 

In beating eggs, a little salt added to the whites helps 
to bring them to a froth more quickly. When frothed whites 
are to be mixed with a heavier or more solid substance, great 
care must be taken not to break down the froth. The object 
of beating being to mix in air, rough handling afterwards 
would render the beating useless; the mixing must therefore 
be done very carefully. They should be folded or wrapped 
up in the other substance, but the mixing also must be thor- 
ough, for any pieces of white separated from the rest will 
toughen and taste leathery, besides failing in the special 
purpose of giving lightness to the mixture. After mixing 
lightly and perfectly all such preparations

Eggs 

should be cooked at once. The white "speck" always should 
be removed from a broken egg, as it is easily distmguished 
after cooking, and in anything of a liquid nature, such as 
custards, sauces, etc., it would be hard and unpleasant.

T is well to have a confectioner's ther- 
mometer for candy making, so that the 
syrup may be removed from the fire 
at exactly the right degree. Such ther- 
mometers are made of wood, brass, or copper, and the degrees 
on them should mark not less than 350°. A thermometer 
always should be gently lowered into the boiling sugar. When 
not m use, it should be kept hanging on a nail or hook. 
When required for candy making, place thermometer in pitcher 
of warm water, so that it may nse gradually, and return it 
to the warm water on removing it from the hot candy. This 
dissolves the clinging candy and protects the tube from break- 
ing. The wooden thermometer can be used to stir with, and 
is very easy to keep clean. 

If there is no thermometer handy it is better to make a 
list of the various stages in sugar boiling, and learn how to 
test the sugar. First there is the "thread" (216° F. to 218° F.) 
This is reached when, on dipping the finger and thumb first 
into cold water and then into the syrup, you can draw them 
apart, and an unbroken thread is formed, which gradually can 
be drawn wider apart on further testing as the degree of 
boiling is completed. 

The next is the "pearl" (220° F.) To see if the syrup 
has reached this stage, after the sugar has dissolved let it 
boil for eight to ten minutes, then dip a wooden skewer into 
the syrup to obtain a drop of it. Dip the finger and thumb 
into cold water, then rub the drop of syrup between them; 
if it feels smooth, the syrup has reached the desired stage. The 
next is the "blow" (230° F.) Dip a spoon into the sugar, 
shake it, and blow through the holes; if sparks of Hght or 
bubbles be seen, you may be sure of the blow. This is fol- 
lowed by the "feather" (235° F.) To test this, dip a spoon 
into the boiling syrup, and when it may be blown easily from 
the spoon in long shreds it has reached the right degree 



Candies 

Next comes the '* ball" (240'' F. to 250° F.) Dip the finger 
and thumb first into cold water, and then into the syrup, the 
latter then can be rolled into a soft ball between the finger 
and thumb. A little longer boiling gives the hard ball. This 
in turn is succeeded by the "crack" (290° F.to 300° F.) To 
test this, drop a little of the syrup into cold water; if it then 
breaks ofF sharp and crisp it has reached the crack. The 
final stage is the "caramel" (350° F.) which comes very quickly 
after the crack, the syrup becoming first a pale yellow, and 
then a rich golden brown, and finally black or burnt. When 
it first reaches this stage the pan should be removed from the 
fire, a little lemon juice or water added, and then the whole 
reboiled to the proper stage or shade. To prevent granu- 
lation, it often is advisable to add a pinch of cream of tartar» 
to the pound of sugar.

parsley and onion. Cook until 
lobsters' claws can easily be pulled 
apart; it will probably take 25 min- 
utes. When cool enough to handle, 
cut lobsters down back, remove meat 
from body and claws. Save coral. 
Put back all tough parts with small 
claws and shells, and cook for 20 min- 
utes in same liquor. Liquor must be 
oonsiderably reduced. Dry coral, rub 
through sieve. Blend Crisco and 
flour in saucepan over fire, stir in 
milk, let this come to boil, add 2 cups 
of strained lobster broth. Bring to 
boiling point, season with salt and 
pepper, and stir in sifted coral enough 
to give liquid bright pink color. Place
