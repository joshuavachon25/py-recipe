THE ROYAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK 



Tlie cuts on this page represent utensils used in the various kinds of baking, and are re- 
ferred to in the Receipts according to numbers. 




DO NOT BUY BAKING POWDER LOOSE OR IN BULK.— (What is meant by loose is 
weighed out in any quantity asked for.) All examinations made by Boards of Health, Govern- 
ment Chemists, and others, prove loose powders are, almost without exception, made from 
alum, and at a cost of about one tenth of what a pure Cream Tartar powder, like the " Royal 
Baking Powder, can be made for. The argument that the consumer will save, in the purchase 
of such poisonous stuff, the cost of can, label, etc., is used simply to enable the seller to make 
a larger profit in selling an alum bulk, or loose, powder at the expense of the unsuspecting 
consumer, than can be made by selling the absolutely pure " Royal " brand. Remember this, 
and insist on getting the " Royal " in cans. 

Do not buy alum baking powders under any circumstances. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

MUST BE CAREFULLY READ BY EVERY ONE USING THIS BOOK 



HINTS ON BAKING. — To achieve perfect success, the cook must use discrimination and 
care. Some flour requires more water, or milk, than others ; so that the quantity 
may have to he varied to make dough of a proper consistency. Different bakings will 
vary as to time and heat required, and should, therefore, be examined occasionally. To 
ascertain whether the bread is sufficiently done in the center of the loaf or cake, thrust a clean 
straw or long thin splinter into it. If done, there will be no dough on it when drawn out. 
Measure the flour, and be careful to mix with it the baking powder in a dry state, and before sift- 
ing. You can always substitute water for milk, or milk for water ; butter for lard, or lard for 
butter. The number of eggs may be increased or diminished, or, in plainer cake, etc. , dispensed 
with entirely. Where fewer eggs are used than directed, always use a little more baking 
powder. Never use sour milk. 

When about to cut new bread or cake, heat the knife very hot ; this will prevent its 
crumbling. 

CAKE BAKING. — For a plain cake made with one pound of flour, Royal Baking Powder, 
etc., the time to be allowed in baking would be from 40 to 50 minutes ; at the outside not more 
than 1 hour. Very rich cakes, in which butter and eggs predominate, take, of course, very 
much longer time to bake, a pound cake taking from IVij to 2 hours, and a bride's cake 3Vk. 
On no account should an oven be too hot when the cake is put in — that is, hot enough to 
brown at once ; if so, in 5 minutes the whole outside will be burned and the interior will stand 
little chance of being baked. The old plan of feeling the handle of the oven door to test the 
heat is not always successful ; it is better to sprinkle a little flour inside and shut the door for 
about 3 minutes ; if at the end of that time it is of a rich light brown, the cake may be put in, 
but if burned the heat must be lessened. 

In baking loaf cake, remember that unless you place a piece of paper over for protection at 
first, a top crust will be formed at once that prevents the raising. When cake is well raised, 
remove the paper for browning on top. 

ADVICE TO THE COOK. — Great cleanliness, as well as care and attention, are required 
from a cook. Keep your hands very clean ; try to prevent your nails from getting black or 
discolored; don't "scatter "in your kitchen; clean up as you go; put cold water into each 
saucepan or stewpan as you finish using it. Dry your saucepans before you put them on the 
shelf. Scour tins with good mineral soap and rinse thoroughly in hot water. In cleaning a 
frying-pan, scour the outside as well as the inside. In cleaning greasy utensils, such as the 
soup-pot and frying-pan, wipe off the worst of the grease with soft paper (which can be 
burned), then soak in warm water to which soap-powder or a little ammonia has been added, 
finishing with mineral soap. Wash your pudding-cloths, scald, and hang them to dry directly 
after using them ; air them before you put them away, or they will be musty : keep in dry 
place. Be careful not to use a knife that has cut onions till it has been cleaned. Keep sink 
and sink-brush very clean ; be careful never to throw anything but water down sink. Do not 
throw cabbage water down it ; throw it away out of doors ; its smell is very bad. Never have 
Sticky plates or dishes ; use very hot water for washing them ; when greasy, change it. Take 
care that you look at the meat the butcher brings, to see that it is good. Let there be no 
waste in the kitchen. 



Bread and Rolls 

BREAD was first made without leaven, 
heavy and solid. Then yeast was dis- 
covered, and yeast-risen bread came into 
use throughout the civilized world. Finally 
baking powder was devised, the most health- 
ful, economical, and convenient of all leavening 
or lightening agents. 

Yeast is a living plant. Mixed with the 
dough it causes fermentation and destruction 
©f a part of the flour, and this produces car- 



bonic-acid gas. The bubbles of this gas become 
entangled in the dough, swelling it up and 
making it spongy. In this process, however, 
a part of the most nutritious elements of the 
flour (estimated at ten per cent.) is destroyed 
in producing the leavening gas ; there is al- 
ways danger of sour dough, and there is a 
delay of many hours for the sponge to rise. 

Perfect bread is that in which wheat is trans- 
posed into an available food without loss of 
any of its valuable properties. 

Royal Baking Powder is now largely used in

place of yeast to leaven bread. It does pre- 
cisely the same work — that is, swells up the 
dough and makes it porous and spongy. But 
the process is not destructive: the baking 
powder by itself produces the leavening gas. 
No part of the flour is decomposed or de- 
stroyed. Moreover, there is no mixing or 
kneading with the hands, no setting of sponge 
overnight, as the loaf is mixed and ready for 
the oven at once. Bread thus made cannot 
sour, but will retain its moisture and freshness, 
and may be eaten while hot or fresh without 
distress even by persons of delicate digestion. 

The ease with which Royal Baking Powder 
bread is made, its cleanliness and healthful- 
ness, have caused it to supersede yeast bread 
with many of the best pastry cooks. 

In making this bread the materials and 
utensils should be brought together before the 
mixing of the dough is begun. Tbe fire must 
be looked to so as to secure a steady, moderate 
heat. Remember to mix the flour and Royal 
Baking Powder together before sifting, and 
sift thoroughly before wetting. 

Royal Baking Powder Bread.— 1 quart flour, 
1 teaspoon salt, Mi teaspoon sugar, 2 heap- 
ing teaspoons Royal Baking Powder,* Mi 
medium-sized cold boiled potato, and water.

Hot Biscuits, Cakes, and 
Muffins 



EXPERIENCED housekeepers agree that 
breakfast is difficult to cater for. Even 
the appetite ordinarily easy to satisfy is 
likely to be captious when approaching the 
first meal of the day. Every article of food 
upon the breakfast-table, therefore, should be 
perfect — the coffee as clear as amber, the 
bacon white and crisp, the biscuits flaky, ten- 
der, delicious. 

As a nation we approve of hot-breads, and 
most of all at the breakfast-table. And while 
we eat and enjoy them, we have the satisfac- 
tion of knowing that American methods and 
American cookery have made them healthful 
as well as appetizing and nutritious. 

And of all the breakfast foods, nothing is 
so appetizing, so appetite-whetting, so always 
dependable, so satisfying, as the light, flaky, 
hot biscuit, with a crisp, brown crust, just 
from the oven, broken apart without use of 
knife, and spread with butter; or, to top off 
the meal, with honey, jam, or marmalade. 

The very simplicity of the methods of mak- 
ing and the familiar, every-day use of this 
little hot bread-morsel have, however, some- 
times led to lack of care in its preparation, so 
that we too seldom find it in perfection upon 
our tables. 

It is the object of this chapter to stimulate 
an interest in and awaken a love for this most 
healthful and economical of our purely Ameri- 
can foods, so that it will be found, as it de- 
serves to be, a prominent part of every day's 
food in every household. 

With a basis of flour, salt, and Royal Baking 
Powder, we can add other ingredients to vary 
and enrich the cakes and biscuits generally 
known to the housewife, and produce in al- 
most endless variety breakfast and luncheon 
foods that shall be dainty and delicious or sub- 
stantial and hearty. 

Are eggs scarce and high, does too much 
shortening disagree with some member of the 
family, Royal Baking Powder permits the les- 
sening of both or either of these ingredients, 
without impairing the delicacy or digestibility 
of the finished biscuit. 

Royal Baking Powder is pure and healthful, 
and its use in excess can produce no harm ; yet 
for cooking results it is best to be guided by the 
quantity specified in the receipts. Baking 
powder could be added until a dry, powdery 
biscuit resulted. 

The mixing of the baking powder, flour, and 
other dry ingredients should be thorough. 
This is imperative if a delicate, evenly leav- 
ened biscuit is wanted. The other ingredients 
can then be added, following the special direc- 
tions as given in each receipt. 

POWDER IS ABSOLUTELY PURE. 



THE ROYAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK 



In using shortening for biscuits, especially 
through the winter season, with some limita- 
tion, good, sweet home-made lard may take 
the place of butter. Butter will color slightly 
yellow ; lard will whiten the biscuits. This 
substitution will not do when considerable 
shortening is called for, as in cake ; but in 
receipts where the quantity does not exceed 
2 ounces or tablespoons to the quart of flour, 
butter may, in the majority of cases, be replaced 
by lard without impairing the taste. 

Biscuits are mixed to a soft dough, which is 
turned out, patted down or rolled to a proper 
thickness, and then cut out and baked. From 
long experience it has been found that the re- 
sult is much better and the food more digestible 
when the finished biscuit is small and not too 
thick. The scientific reason for this is that the 
oven heat necessaryforbiscuit,if they are made 
very large, will brown the outside before the 
center is as thoroughly baked as it ought to be. 
The dough should be rolled out until Mi inch 
thick ; the biscuits should be of medium size, — 
2 inches or less across, — and placed slightly 
apart in the pans. A favorite cutter of expert 
biscuit-makers is the open end (not the cover) 
of a V4 -pound Royal Baking Powder can. A 
good oven heat will bake the biscuit perfectly 
in from 15 to 20 minutes, and even a dyspeptic 
can eat them without fear of consequences. 
The biscuit may, of course, be made thicker or 
thinner, as more or less of the soft inside part 
may be preferred, but the time of baking must 
be regulated accordingly. 

The same directions will apply to hot baking 
powder breads made with a batter. If baked 
in a sheet the batter should rarely be more 
than an inch deep in the pan, sometimes less ; 
if in cups or molds they should not be more 
than % full. This allows the heat to pene- 
trate the mixture quickly ; the moisture and 
heat start the baking powder into life ; each 
tiny grain of the powder acts on the materials 
surrounding it ; the dough or batter expands, 
then is stiffened by the heat, and all the starch 
grains are thoroughly and evenly cooked. 

Royal Hot Biscuit. — 1 quart flour, 1 tea- 
spoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 
1 tablespoon lard or butter, 1 pint sweet milk, 
cold (never use sour milk) ; use cold water 
when milk cannot be obtained. Sift together 
flour, salt, and powder; rub in shortening; 
add milk; form into smooth, consistent dough. 
Flour the board, turn out dough, roll out to 
thickness of Mi inch, cut with small round cut- 
ter ; lay them close together on greased bak- 
ing-tin ; bake in good hot oven. Old biscuit 
can be made fresh by moistening and placing in 
oven until heated through. 

Breakfast Biscuit.— Take 1 quart sweet 
milk, Mi cup melted butter, a little salt, 2 tea- 
spoons Royal Baking Powder, flour enough to 
make a stiff batter ; do not knead into dough, 
but drop into buttered tins from a spoon ; bake 
in a hot oven — unless it is hot they will not 
be light and tender. 



Emergency Biscuit.— 2 cups flour, Mi tea- 
spoon salt, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking Powder; 
mix and sift ; rub in 1 tablespoon butter. Mix 
to a thick batter with milk, drop by small 
spoonfuls on greased pans, and bake in quick 
oven. 

Egg Biscuit.— Mix and sift well together 1 
pint flour, Mi teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, 
1 teaspoon Royal Baking Powder. Beat 1 egg, 
add Mi cup milk, stir into dry mixture, adding 
more milk if necessary to mix to soft dough. 
Turn out on board, knead for a moment, cut 
into circles, place 1 inch apart on greased pans. 
Brush with little beaten egg, and bake in very 
hot oven. 

Sandwich Biscuit. — Sift together 1 pint 
flour, % teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon Royal Bak- 
ing Powder. Rub in 1 heaping tablespoon but- 
ter. Mix to a soft dough with milk. Roll out 
% inch thick. Cut into rounds. On Mt of the 
rounds spread a little soft butter, add a thick 
layer of finely chopped and seasoned cold 
meat ; cover with remaining rounds and press 
together. Brush tops with milk, place 1 inch 
apart on greased pans, and bake in hot oven. 

Nut Biscuit. — Sift together 2 cups flour, % 
teaspoon salt, 1 heaping teaspoon Royal Bak- 
ing Powder. Rub in 1 heaping tablespoon but- 
ter, add 1 cup ground or very finely chopped 
nuts — English walnuts, hickory -nuts, or 
almonds — and 2 tablespoons sugar ; mix to a 
soft dough with milk. Mold with the hands 
into small balls, place well apart on greased 
pans, brush each with milk, put a pinch of 
chopped nuts on top, and bake in hot oven. 

Diamonds. — Prepare dough as for Royal 
biscuit. Knead and roll out M> inch thick. 
Cut in strips 2 inches wide, then cut strips 
into diamonds ; place on greased pans 1 inch 
apart, brush with milk, and bake in very hot 
oven. 



Royal Muffins. — Beat 3 eggs, add 1 pint 
milk, Mi teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, and 
sufficient flour to make a drop batter — about 
3 cups — into which has been thoroughly sifted 
2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder. Beat hard 
for 1 minute, fill greased muffin-cups or -pans 
% full, bake in hot oven about 20 minutes. 

Boston Muffins. — lMi pints flour, Mi pint 
Indian corn meal, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 tea- 
spoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 
1 tablespoon butter, 3 eggs, and 1 pint (full

(which may be omitted without detriment). 
Sift together flour, corn meal, sugar, salt, and 
powder ; rub in butter or lard ; add eggs, 
beaten, milk, and extract cinnamon. Mix into 
batter a little stiffer than ordinary griddle- 
cake batter. Have griddle heated regularly all 
over; grease it, lay on it muffin-rings, also 
greased ; half fill them with batter. As soon 
as risen to tops of rings, turn them over gently 
with cake-turner; bake nice brown on either 
side. They should bake in 7 or 8 minutes. 

French Muffins. — lMi pints flour, 1 cup 
honey, Mi teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal 
Baking Powder, 2 tablespoons butter, 3 eggs, 
and little over Mi pint milk or thin cream.

Fritters and Waffles 

FRITTERS are served as a vegetable or a 
sweet, for a lunch, dinner, or supper, 
according to the ingredients used in mak- 
ing them. Whether sweet or plain, the foun- 
dation batter is much the same, and, with some 
additions, the first receipt given in this chap- 
ter can be used for many kinds of fritters. 
By the use of Royal Baking Powder a fine frit- 
ter batter may be stirred up in a moment, and 
a meal which it may be thought necessary to 
extend, perhaps because of unexpected guests, 
can be embellished by the addition of a delicate 
and tasty dish. 

A fritter batter which is to be used as a 
medium for whole or sliced fruit should be 
quite thin, as it is to serve as a cover for the 
fruit. When chopped fruits or vegetables are 
stirred in, or the batter is to be used plain, it 
should be thick enough to retain its shape 
when dropped by spoonfuls into the frying- 
kettle. The fat should be deep enough to 
cover the fritters, and it should be smoking 
hot when used. Each fritter will at first sink 
to the bottom of the kettle ; then, as the heat 
starts the baking powder into action and the 
dough begins to swell, it will rise to the surface, 
and should be gently turned, the turning to be 
repeated until the fritter is finely colored. Most 
fritters are done within five minutes, the time 
needed to cook them being determined by one 
which should be cooked as a tester. 

The very word " waffles " brings to our minds 
a host of pleasant recollections. The only 
drawback, in the old days, was that they must be 
started so long before they were ready for the 
irons, for home-made yeast took time to raise 
the batter to the requisite degree of lightness. 
Now, by the use of Royal Baking Powder, they 
can be prepared in five minutes. They are 
better than of old, too, for there is no yeasty 
taste to them ; they are light, tender, and 
toothsome, and, what is most important, en- 
tirely digestible and wholesome.

Griddle Cakes, Etc. 

THE griddle cake as made to-day with 
Royal Baking Powder is another arti- 
cle of food which has taken high rank 
upon the American table. The heavy, sour, 
grease-soaked, indigestible griddle cake of old 
is. where modern methods are employed, a 
thing of the past. The properly made griddle 
cake is a delicious food, healthful, appetizing, 
and nutritious. 

Raising the griddle cake with yeast is alto- 
gether obsolete with expert cooks. Mixtures 
of soda, saleratus, sour milk, buttermilk, etc., 
are likewise not permissible. Royal Baking 
Powder has altogether redeemed the griddle 
cake. It makes the cake light, tender, digest- 
ible, and its preparation and baking are the 
work of a moment only. 

Royal Baking Powder, plain, sweet milk, 
flour, and a little salt make a food fit for a 
feast. What so simple, so easily prepared ? 
Eggs are altogether unessential. 



The batter must be thin, the cakes made 
small and not too thick, — about a good ^ inch 
thick when baked, — browned, and neatly 
turned. The griddle must be merely rubbed 
with grease, not grease-soaked. This is highly 
important. Take a thick piece of salt pork 
on a fork, or a lump of suet in a piece of 
cheese-cloth, and rub lightly over the hot grid- 
dle and pour the batter on immediately. 

Remember that buckwheat is one of the 
most difficult flours to lighten. Where it en- 
ters into combination with other materials this 
fact must be recognized and a somewhat larger 
proportion of Royal Baking Powder allowed. 
Made in the manner directed in these receipts 
buckwheat cakes can be safely and profusely 
eaten by every one.

Royal Buckwheats.— This is the most de- 
licious of all the griddle cakes. It has been 
against buckwheat cakes when made from 
yeast or risen overnight that it was difficult 
to make them light and sweet, and that dis- 
agreeable effects followed their eating. It is 
found that by the use of the Royal Baking 
Powder to raise the batter these objections 
have been entirely overcome, and that buck- 
wheat cakes are made a most delicious food, 
light, sweet, tender, and perfectly wholesome, 
that can be eaten by any one without the

Flour 

FANCY-CAKE makers and confectioners 
prefer to use "pastry" flour for the 
making of cakes and pastry, which is a 
flour of different grade from that used for 
bread and general baking purposes. Bread 
flour contains a large proportion of gluten, the 
nitrogenous property of the wheat grain, which 
gives bone and muscle, and makes bread a 
nutritious food. When bread flour is used for 
cake and pie crust the result is not quite as 
flaky and light as it should be, because of the 
gluten in the flour. A special sack of pastry flour 
for use in making fine cakes and pastry will be 
advantageous. In appearance pastry flour is 
whiter than bread flour. When rubbed between 
the fingers it feels as soft and fine as corn- 
starch ; if squeezed in the hand it forms a firm 
ball. Because of this tendency to "pack "it 
should always be sifted very thoroughly. 

Generally speaking. Royal Baking Powder 
used with any good flour will make satisfactory 
cake which will be creditable to any house- 
keeper. 

Royal Baking Powder 

In no department of cookery is Royal Bak- 
ing Powder of greater use and importance than 
in making fine cake. Eggs are too expensive 
nowadays to be used as lavishly as they were 
a generation ago — ten or more to a cake. Not 
as a substitute wholly, but as an accessory, — 
as an aid toward producing the lightness and 
digestibility of the food. — we use the Royal 
Baking Powder. We thereby obtain uniformly 
good results and do a large amount of work at 
a minimum expense. The quantity called for 
by the receipt should be thoroughly mixed 
with the flour before the latter is sifted. 

The Royal Baking Powder has worked a 
revolution in cake-making. It is now no 
trouble to make at home the finest cakes in 
almost endless variety, which shall rival the 
productions of the confectioner. If you follow 
these directions there will be no spoiled or 
heavy cakes, no wasted materials through fail- 
ures in mixing or baking. 

To Mix Cakes Containing Butter 

Cream the butter, beating till light. Gradu- 
ally add the sugar, beating till light and 
creamy. Add the yolks of eggs beaten till 
light, then the flavoring. Beat in alternately 
the liquid and flour, the latter mixed with salt 
and baking powder. Lastly, add the beaten 
whites, and fruit, if used. 

To Mix Cakes Containing No Butter 

Beat the egg yolks until very light and thick.

Add the sugar gradually, beating till very £ ifted ^ the baking ' powder . Lastly , add 

light and spongy. Add the flavoring and the whites whipped to a stiff frot" 

liquid, if used. Have the whites of eggs almonds. Bake in a loaf in a mode]

whipped to a stiff froth. Add them alternately 
with the sifted flour (mixed with baking pow- 
der), and cut both in very lightly and quickly. 

To Bake Cakes 

Thin cakes need a hotter oven than loaf 
cakes. Cakes without butter (sponge cakes) 
should have a more moderate, longer baking 
than cakes of same size containing butter. 
The process of baking may be divided into 
four periods or quarters of time : in first quar- 
ter the cake begins to rise ; in second quarter 
it is still rising and begins to color ; in third 
quarter it browns all over ; in last quarter it 
shrinks from sides of pan. 

To test, insert a clean broom-straw into the 
middle of the cake ; if it comes out clean, the 
cake is done. Hold the pan to the ear; it 
should scarcely " sing." 

Line loaf -cake pans with buttered paper ; 
fruit cakes need several thicknesses of the 
same. 

Do not use sour milk, buttermilk, or any of 
the so-called prepared or self-raising flours.

Fruit Short Cakes 

THE old-fashioned fruit short cakes were 
generally made with flour, soda, sour 
milk, and shortening, and were restricted 
to the strawberry season. We now use Royal 
Baking Powder for lightening them, employ 
all the fruits of the various seasons, and thus 
feast ourselves upon the delicate confections 
almost the whole year through. The short 
cake made with Royal Baking Powder and 
sweet milk is incomparably better, surer, and 
more healthful than the old-fashioned concoc- 
tion. Too much skill was required in combin- 
ing soda and sour milk. The milk had to be 
at just the right stage of sourness ; not a grain 
more of soda could be used than was sufficient 
to neutralize the acid in the milk, or the cake 
would be yellow, with a disagreeable odor and 
soapy taste ; if too little, the cake was heavy. 
But even the young or inexperienced house- 
keeper will find that with Royal Baking Powder 
a perfect short cake is an easy and agreeable 
task. The baking powder only needs to be 
thoroughly sifted with the flour, so that it may 
evenly lighten the cake. Use sweet milk al- 
ways. For the old-fashioned short cake no 
eggs are needed, the dough being put together 
in the same way as for baking powder biscuit. 
Throughout the summer fresh fruit of all 



kinds can be used. With cold weather substi- of fresh fruit, finishing as for other short cakes 



salt, and powder together, rub in the butter 
cold; add the milk and mix into a smooth 
dough, just soft enough to handle; divide in 
half, and roll out to the size of breakfast-plates ; 
lay on a greased baking-tin (fig. XIV), and 
bake in hot oven 20 minutes ; separate the 
cakes without cutting, as cutting makes them 
heavy. 

Short Cake, 2. — 1 quart flour, Mi cup but-

Doughnuts and Crullers 

THESE old-fashioned "fried cakes," as 
they used to be called, need the addition 
of Royal Baking Powder to make them 
light. By its use less shortening is necessary 
and the cakes are more tender and far more 
digestible. After it is mixed with the flour 
the other ingredients are added and the dough 
quickly rolled out, cut, and at once cooked. 
The fat should be in a deep pot (to obviate any 
danger of boiling over), and should be of suffi- 
cient depth to cover the dough when first 
dropped in. It should be smoking hot, or the 
dough will absorb grease and be soggy. Not 
more than half a dozen should be dropped in 
at one time, or the fat will be unduly cooled 
and some of the cakes submerged during the 
entire cooking ; in which case the cakes when 
cooked will be greasy and not light. One 
or two pieces of dough should be cooked first 
as testers. When done the cakes should be 
drained on unglazed paper, then rolled in pow- 
dered sugar.

sliced apples mixed with sugar and a little 
powdered cinnamon. Draw up crust and cloth 
so as to completely cover apples ; tie cloth, al- 
lowing a little room to swell. Drop in kettle 
of rapidly boiling water, with trivet at bottom 
to prevent scorching. Keep at a rapid boil for 

2 hours. If water stops boiling the dumpling 
will be heavy. Or place in steamer and steam 

3 hours. Serve hot with cream and sugar or a 
liquid sauce. 

Farina Dumplings. — 1 quart milk, 10 ounces 
farina, 3 eggs, lMi teaspoons Royal Baking 
Powder, a tablespoon fresh butter, Mi pound 
flour. Bring milk to a boil, stir in farina, and 



boil till well done, continually stirring. After 
cooling, stir in the melted butter and eggs 
previously beaten up, and last add flour sifted 
with baking powder and salt. Drop with ta- 
blespoon into boiling water, well salted; boil 
about 15 minutes till they rise ; take out with 
skimmer and serve with fruit sauce. 

Peach Dumplings.— Proceed as directed 
for apple dumplings, 1. 

Peach Dumplings, 2.— Bring 1 cup water, 
2 tablespoons butter, to boiling point ; turn in 
quickly 1 cup dry flour ; stir till mixture draws 
away from sides of pan. Take from fire and 
cool. Work in 4 eggs, % cup flour mixed with 
Mi teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, more flour 
if necessary to make a soft dough. Pat out in 
a cake, cut in rounds with a saucer. On each 
place a pared, unpitted peach. Draw dough 
round to cover the fruit. Place in greased 
pan, brush with milk, and bake 30 minutes in 
moderate oven. Serve with clear sauce. 

Receipts for making dumplings for a stew 
or fricassee frequently call for shortening. 
This is a mistake, and usually results in 
heavy, soggy dumplings. Heaviness may also 
be caused by a removal of the lid of pot or 
steamer before the dumplings are done. Flour, 
salt, Royal Baking Powder, and sweet milk 
are all that are needed to make tender, fluffy 
dumplings of this kind. The dry ingredients 
should be sifted carefully together, then quickly 
mixed with the milk. During the cooking the 
liquid in pot or steamer should be kept at a 
steady boil. No more batter or dough should 
be dropped in at one time than will cover the 
surface of the liquid or rest on top of the meat, 
for, if too many dumplings are dropped in at 
once, those underneath are sure to be soggy. 
The cover should not be lifted until the dump- 
lings are done. 

Dumplings for Soup.— 1 cup flour, V 4 tea- 
spoon salt, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, 
sifted together. Add M3 cup finely chopped 
suet, and enough milk to make stiff dough. 
Bake into dumplings size of marbles, drop into 
soup, cover, and boil 10 minutes. 

Egg Dumplings for Soup.— Beat 2 eggs, add 
l k teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons milk. Sift 1 
cup flour with 1 scant teaspoon Royal Baking 
Powder, add egg mixture, and more flour if 
necessary to make thick batter. Drop by half 
teaspoonfuls in boiling soup; cover, cook 10 
minutes. 

Dumplings for Stews.— Mix and sift 1 pint 
flour, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, Mi tea- 
spoon salt Mix to soft dough with milk. 
Turn on board, roll out 1 inch thick, cut in 
small circles. Roll eack in flour, drop on top 
simmering stew. Cover, cook 20 minutes 
without opening pot. 

Dumplings for Stews, 2. — Mix 2 cups flour, 
1 teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, Ms teaspoon 
salt. Add milk to mix to thick batter. Drop 
by small spoonfuls over boiling stew, and cook

Pies 

THE richest pastry for pies is called puff 
paste, and much skill and practice 
are required to make it flaky, tender, 
and very light. First-class puff paste will rise 
in baking to double its thickness and be in 
light, flaky layers and without greasiness. The 
novice must learn to handle it as lightly and 
little as possible in rolling and turning. It 
should be put in the ice-box as soon as made 
and stand at least twelve hours before being 
used. 

Pastry flour should always be used for pie 
crust. It is whiter than bread flour and when 
rubbed between the fingers it feels very smooth 
and soft, like corn-starch. Carefully sift before 
using. 

Where it is desired to have a plainer pastry, 
or one less troublesome to make and more 
economical, the use of a small quantity of 
Royal Baking Powder will give a light and 
tender crust. As in other cases, the baking 
powder must be mixed and sifted with the 
flour before the shortening is added. Sweet 
home-made lard may be used in place of butter, 
•either wholly or in part, giving a less expen- 



sive but equally good and light paste. Never 
use sour milk or so-called prepared or self- 
raising flours. 

Paste for Pies.— 3 cups sifted flour, Mi tea- 
spoon Royal Baking Powder, large pinch salt, 

1 cup cream, Mi cup butter. Sift flour, salt, 
and powder together; add the cream; mix 
into smooth, rather firm paste ; flour the board, 
roll it out thin ; spread the butter on it evenly, 
fold in three ; roll out thin, and fold in three ; 
repeat twice more and use. 

Paste, 2. — 3 cups flour, Mi teaspoon Royal 
Baking Powder, Mi pound beef suet, freed of 
skin and chopped very fine, 1 cup water. 
Place the flour, sifted with the powder, in 
bowl ; add suet and water ; mix into smooth, 
rather firm dough. 

Paste, 3.-3 cups sifted flour, Mi cup lard, 
lMs cups butter, Ms teaspoon Royal Baking 
Powder, 1 cup water. Cut lard into flour, 
sifted with powder; mix into smooth, firm 
paste with the water ; place it to cool for 15 
minutes ; meanwhile press milk and salt from 
butter by pressing in clean, wet towel, and 
flour it. Roll out dough on well -floured board ; 
place butter on it; fold dough over it, com- 
pletely covering butter ; roll it out lightly to 
Mi inch in thickness, turn it over, fold each 
end to middle, flour it, roll out again; fold 
ends to middle, and turn it; repeat this 3 
times more, and use. If this paste is made in 
summer, put on ice after each operation of 
folding and rolling. 

Paste, 4.-5 cups flour, 1 cup butter, 1 cup 
lard, 1 cup water, Mi teaspoon Royal Baking 
Powder. Sift flour with powder ; rub in lard 
and butter cold ; add the water ; mix into a 
smooth, lithe dough. 

Paste, s (Puff Paste).— 3 cups sifted flour, 

2 cups butter, 1 egg yolk, a little salt. This is 
difficult to make. The essentials are : A cool 
place to make it in, ice broken up in 2 shallow 
cake-pans, good flour, and butter, firm, with 
salt and buttermilk worked out. Sift flour on 
pastry slab, form it in a ring with back of 
your nand. Place in center the egg yolk and 
salt ; add a little ice-water, and from inside of 
ring gradually take flour, adding a little at a 
time, as you require it, more ice-water, about a 
cup altogether, until you have smooth, fine 
paste, very tenacious and lithe. Place in ice- 
box 15 minutes, then roll out to size of a din- 
ner-plate ; lay on it butter, and wrap over it 
edges of dough, carefully covering it ; turn it 
upside down, roll out very thin ; then turn 
face down — the face is side of paste next to 
rolling-pin — folding it in three, squarely ; re- 
peat this three times more, placing it in thin tin 
on the broken ice, and other tin containing 
ice on it, after each turn or operation of fold- 
ing and rolling. By this method this diffi- 
cult puff paste may be made successfully in 
hottest weather. 

Paste, 6. — 3 cups sifted flour, 1 large cup 
butter, Mi teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, 3 
tablespoons sugar, Mi cup milk. Sift flour

color. 

Lovers of Chocolate, in any and every 
form, can make this addition to a common 
custard pie. Beat 1 egg to a stiff froth, then 
add pulverized sugar and grated chocolate 
with Mi teaspoon extract vanilla; spread this 
on the top of the pie and let it harden for a 
moment in the oven. Or you may prepare it 
in still another way. Put the chocolate in a 
basin on the back of the stove, and let it melt 
(do not put a drop of water with it) ; when

For this purpose oranges or lemons should be 
carefully pared, and all the white inner skin 
removed that is possible, to prevent bitterness ; 
then cut either in thin horizontal slices if

lemons, or in quarters if oranges. For cherries, 
strawberries, currants, etc., choose the largest 
and finest, leaving stems out. Peaches should 
be pared and cut in halves, and sweet, juicy 
pears may be treated in the same way, or look 
nice when pared, leaving on the stems, and

Frozen Desserts 

HOW TO FREEZE.— Pound ice to bits 
size of hickory nut. Use salt in lumps 
tyj size of a pea. Allow 1 part salt to 3 
parts ice. Mix together in pail. In bottom of 
freezer put 1 inch layer of mixture, and pack. 
Arrange and fasten can in freezer. Fill up 
space between with the mixture, packing hard. 
Turn can occasionally to make sure it will 
run freely. When ice is within 1 inch of top 
of can open and fill can, replace and fasten top. 
Turn slowly at first. Increase speed, adding 
more ice and salt as mixture sinks. When 
cream is very firm open can, draw out dasher, 
work cream down in can with wooden spoon, 
cover top with paper, then with can cover, add 
more ice and salt, heaping it over top of can. 
Cover with heavy blanket, set away in cold 
place for 2 hours. 

Plain Ice Cream. — Scald 1 pint milk ; mix 1 
cup sugar with 2 tablespoons flour, pinch salt, 
and 2 beaten eggs. Add to hot milk, stir over

Water Ices.— Boil 1 quart water and 1 pint 
sugar 5 minutes. Add V% box gelatine soaked 
in cold water, stir till dissolved and chill. Add 
1 cup lemon juice and freeze. 

All water ices are made in this way, varying 
the proportion of sugar according to the acidity 
of the fruit used. Canned fruit syrups may be 
substituted for fresh fruit juice. 



Biscuit Glace.— IMi pints cream, 12 ounces 
sugar, yolks of 8 eggs, and 1 tablespoon extract 
vanilla. Take 6 ounces crisp macaroons, pound 
in mortar to dust. Mix cream, sugar, eggs,

raspberries through hair-sieve to give 3 pints 
juice. Add 1 pound pulverized white sugar 
and juice of 1 lemon, with 1 teaspoon extract 
raspberry. Place in freezer and freeze. 



Canning and Preserving 

CANNING. — The important points to be 
observed in canning are, to use only 
sound, ripe fruit ; to have hot syrup and 
air-tight jars; to fill jars to overflowing and 
seal immediately. Jars should be scalded and 
tested before using. Patent canners greatly 
simplify the work. 

Pick over the fruit, stem, pare, cut, wash, 
etc., and pack in jars. Make syrup by adding 
% pint boiling water to 1 pound sugar. When 
clear, bring to boiling point and carefully fill 
the jars. Stand in canner or on board in wash- 
boiler containing water up to shoulders of

Preserving. — Preserves require from 34 to 
1 pound of sugar to each pound of fruit, and 
Mi cup water to each pound sugar. The fruit 
should be simmered in the syrup until tender, 
a little at a time ; skimmed out into the jars ; 
when all are done the syrup should be brought 
to boiling point, jars filled and sealed. Hard 
fruits like quinces should be first steamed or 
cooked in boiling water till tender. 

Jams. — Jams are xisually made with small 
fruits or with chopped large fruits ; they are 
cooked with an equal weight of sugar till rich 
and thick, then put into tumblers or small 
jars and sealed. 

Jellies. — Use equal parts of sugar and 
drained fruit juice. Mash and heat berries 
till juice runs readily, then turn into bags of 
unbleached muslin or 2 thicknesses of cheese- 
cloth and let drip. Measure juice and sugar. 
Boil juice 20 minutes. Have sugar in shallow 
pan, heat through in open oven. Add to boil- 
ing juice, boil up once, take off fire and pour 
into tumblers. Fruit like apples and quinces 
should be chopped and covered with water, 
then simmered till tender before turning into 
jelly-bags. 

Spiced Fruits. — These are also called sweet 
pickled fruits. For 4 pounds prepared fruit 
allow 1 pint vinegar, 2 pounds brown sugar, 
Mi cup whole spices — cloves, allspice, stick cin- 
namon, and cassia-buds. Tie spices in thin 
muslin bag, boil 10 minutes with vinegar and 
sugar. Skim, add fruit, cook till tender. Boil 
down syrup, pour over fruit in jars, and seal. 
If put in stone pots, boil syrup 3 successive 
mornings and pour over fruit. Currants, 
peaches, grapes, pears, and berries may be 
prepared in this way, also ripe cucumbers, 
muskmelons, and watermelon rind. 



Soups 



SOUP STOCK is made from cheap, tough 
cuts. The meat should be cut in small 
pieces and soaked in cold water for 
half an hour to draw out the juices. Bone is 
added for the sake of the gelatine which it con- 
tains, and which will give body to the soup. A 
good proportion is 1 pound each of meat and 



bone to each quart of water. Use a kettle with 
a very tight cover and simmer slowly for a 
number of hours. Stock is better when made 
the day before it is to be used. 

Soup Stock. — 1 pound lean beef, 1 pound 
bone (or 2 pounds of shin), 1 quart cold water, 
1 teaspoon salt, Mi teaspoon peppercorns, 2 
cloves, 2 allspice berries, 1 sprig parsley, 1 tea- 
spoon mixed herbs, 1 tablespoon each kind 
chopped vegetable. Prepare meat as above, 
soak in water Mt hour, heat slowly and simmer 
3 hours, add vegetables and seasonings, sim- 
mer 1 hour longer, and strain. Next day re- 
move cake of fat. 

To clear stock beat white 1 egg till frothy, 
add with broken shell to above stock when 
cold (after fat is removed) ; heat slowly and 
stir constantly. Boil 10 minutes without stir- 
ring ; set aside 10 minutes ; strain through 2 
thicknesses cheesecloth dipped in cold water. 

Soups with Pastes or Vegetables. — Pre- 
pare and clear stock as above. In salted water 
boil macaroni, vermicelli, barley, rice, tapioca, 
or other vegetables or dry material until done ; 
drain and add to the clear soup and simmer to- 
gether 10 minutes. Proportion, Mi cup cooked 
material to 1 quart stock. Vegetables should 
be boiled in salted water, cut in shapes, and 
added to stock in same proportion. 

Tomato Soup with Stock. — 1 quart stock, 
1 can tomatoes, salt, pepper, and sugar to taste. 
Stew and strain tomatoes ; add to boiling stock, 
season, and simmer 10 minutes. 

Tomato Soup without Stock. — Stew to- 
gether for 10 minutes 1 can tomatoes, 1 pint 
water, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon sugar, 5 
cloves, Mi teaspoon peppercorns, 1 tablespoon 
chopped onion, 1 tablespoon chopped parsley. 
Rub through sieve, return to fire, and thicken 
with 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon flour 
rubbed together and stirred in. 

Mock Bisque Soup. — Mi can tomatoes, \Mi 
tablespoons butter, lMi tablespoons flour, 1 
quart milk, salt and pepper. Stew and strain 
tomatoes; scald milk in double boiler and 
thicken with the flour and butter ; season to- 
matoes well and reheat. Take both from fire 
and mix together ; if tomatoes are acid add 
pinch of soda. If mixed on fire soup is apt to 
curdle. 

Scotch Broth.— Soak Mi cup pearl barley 
overnight. Cut 2 pounds neck of mutton in 
bits, add 2 quarts water, soak 1 hour. Heat 
slowly, skim, add barley, skim again; simmer 
1 hour, add Mi cup each diced onion, carrot, 
turnip, celery fried for 5 minutes in 1 table- 
spoon dripping. Simmer 3 hours. Season 
well, thicken a little with flour, add 1 table- 
spoon chopped parsley, and serve. 

Consomme.— 1 chicken, 3 pounds lean beef , 
1 onion, 1 turnip, 2 carrots, bunch sweet herbs, 
7 quarts cold water, Mi cup sago soaked in cold 
water, pepper and salt. Cut beef in strips and 
disjoint chicken, slice vegetables, chop herbs, 
put all on with water to cook slowly for 6 hours. 
Take out chicken and beef; salt and pepper 
and put into jar. Strain soup, pulping vegeta- 
bles through a sieve. Season and divide it, 
pouring Mi on meat in jar, and setting in pot 
of hot water to cook, covered, 2 hours more. 
Heat the rest and skim ; put in sago, simmer 
for Mi hour, then pour out. When 2 hours

Stick onions with cloves, add them with other 
vegetables to meat; pour over all the pot liq- 
uor ; set over slow fire and let simmer gently, 
removing all scum as it rises. Strain through 
fine hair-sieve 

Clam Soup. — Boil juice of clams, make a 
little drawn butter and mix with the juice ; stir 
till it boils, chop up clams and put them in ; 
season to taste with pepper, salt, and little 
lemon juice ; cream or milk is to be added. Boil 
over slow fire 1 hour. 

Soups of Dried Pea's or Beans.— Pick and 
soak split peas, dried green peas, or black or 
white beans overnight. Drain, measure, add 
4 times as much cold water ; to each quart of 
water, % onion. Simmer slowly till soft. Rub 
through sieve. Return to fire, season with 
salt and pepper ; for each quart thicken with 1 
teaspoon each butter and flour. Boil up again 
for a few minutes. Black bean soup should 
also have a pinch of mustard and a little lemon 
juice added, and slices of hard-boiled egg. 

Croutons. — Trim crust from stale bread and 
cut in ^-inch dice. Fry golden brown in a 
little butter or in a kettle of smoking-hot fat.

frying they may be browned in the oven. 

Ox=tail Soup. — 1 ox-tail, 2 pounds lean beef, 
4 carrots, 3 onions, thyme and parsley, pepper 
and salt to taste, 4 quarts cold water. Cut tail 
into joints, fry brown in good dripping. Slice 
onions and 2 carrots and fry in the same, when 
you have taken out the pieces of tail. When 
done tie the thyme and parsley in lace bag, 
and drop into the soup-pot. Put in the tail, 
then the beef cut into strips. Grate over 
them 2 whole carrots, pour over all the water, 
and boil slowly 4 hours ; strain and season ; 
thicken with brown flour wet with cold water ; 
boil 15 minutes longer and serve. 



Fish 



DIRECTIONS FOR PREPARING.— Clean 
fish carefully, slit it low enough so as 
not to have any blood on the backbone, 
but do not make too large a cut so as to spoil 
look of fish ; wash thoroughly in cold water. 

THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER IS ABSOLUTELY PURE 



Great care must be taken not to break gall, for 
it would make fish bitter. Use good dripping 
or lard for frying. 

To Broil Fish. — Clean, wash, and wipe dry. 
Split so that when laid flat the backbone will 
be in the middle, or take the backbone out. 
Sprinkle with salt and lay, inside down, upon 
a buttered gridiron over a clear fire until it is 
nicely colored, then turn. When done, put 
upon a hot dish, butter plentifully, and pepper. 
Put a hot cover over it and send to table. 

Boiled Bass, or other Fish. — Put sufficient 
water in pot to enable fish, if alive, to swim 
easily. Add Vz cup vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, 
1 onion, 1 dozen whole black peppers, 1 blade 
mace. Sew up fish in piece of clean net or 
muslin, fitted to shape. Heat slowly for first 
Vi hour; then boil 8 minutes, at least, to 
pound, quite fast. Unwrap, and pour over it 
cup of drawn butter, based upon the liquor in 
which fish was boiled, with juice of V2 lemon 
stirred into it. 

Creamed Fish. — Steam 2 pounds codfish, 
break in flakes, removing bones and skin. 
Make 1 pint white sauce (see Meat and Fish 
Sauces). Grease a baking-dish, fill with alter- 
nate layers of fish and sauce, seasoning with 
salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and lemon juice 
or a few drops of vinegar. Mix together 1 cup 
dry bread crumbs and 3 tablespoons melted 
butter; spread over top and brown in quick 
oven. 

This may be varied by using tomato, becha- 
mel, curry, or any other sauce, or by adding 
grated cheese or sliced hard-boiled eggs to the 
white sauce ; by baking in shells or patty-pans 
in place of the deep dish, or by covering with 
mashed potato or biscuit crust instead of 
crumbs. 

Broiled Salt Mackerel.— Freshen by soak- 
ing it overnight in water, taking care that the 
skin lies uppermost. In the morning dry it 
without breaking, cut off the head and tip of 
the tail, place it between the bars of a buttered 
fish-gridiron, and broil to a light brown ; lay it 
on a hot dish, and dress with a little butter, 
pepper, and lemon juice, vinegar, or chopped 
pickle. 

Broiled Halibut.— Slices of halibut, salt, 
pepper, butter. Cut the slices of fish about an 
inch thick, season with pepper and salt, and 
lay them in melted butter % hour, allowing 3 
tablespoons of butter to a pound of fish, then 
roll them in flour, and broil about 20 minutes. 
Serve very hot. 

Codfish Balls. — Put fish in cold water, set 
on back of stove ; when water gets hot, pour 
off and put on cold again until fish is fresh 
enough; then pick it up. Boil potatoes and 
mash them; mix fish and potatoes together 
while potatoes are hot, taking % potatoes and 
Mj fish. Put in plenty of butter; make into 
balls and fry in plenty of lard. Have lard hot 
before putting in balls. 

Variation may be had by rolhng each ball 
in beaten egg, then in dry bread crumbs be- 
fore frying. 

Fried Blue Fish, and other Kinds.— Clean, 
wipe dry, inside and out. Sprinkle with flour, 
and season with salt. Fry in hot butter or 
sweet lard. % lard and V<j butter make a good 
mixture for frying fish. The moment fish are

done to good brown, take them from fat and 
drain in hot strainer ; garnish with parsley. 

Fish Chowder. — Cut 2 or 3 slices of salt pork 
into dice pieces; fry to crisp, and turn the 
whole into chowder-kettle. Pare 6 medium- 
sized potatoes and cut them,in two. Peel small 
onion and chop fine. Put potatoes into kettle 
with part of onion. Cut fish (which should he 
fresh cod or haddock) into convenient pieces, 
and lay over potatoes ; sprinkle over it rest of 
the onion. Season well with salt and pepper, 
add just enough water to come to top of fish. 
Pour over the whole quart can tomatoes ; 
cover closely and allow to cook about as long 
as takes to boil potatoes; then add 2 quarts 
milk, and let it scald up again. Season with 
tomato catsup, and more salt and pepper if 
required. 

To Fry Brook Trout or any other Small 
Fish. — Clean fish, and let them lie few minutes 
wrapped singly in clean dry towel; season 
with pepper and salt ; roll in corn meal, fry in 
Vs butter and % lard; drain on sieve, and 
serve hot. 



Shell Fish 

CLAM CHOWDER.— 25 clams cut up, Mi 
pound salt pork chopped fine, 6 potatoes 
sliced thin, 4 onions sliced thin. Put 
pork in kettle ; after cooking a short time add 
potatoes, onions, and juice of clams. Cook 
2V-2 hours, then add clams ; 15 minutes before 
serving add 2 quarts milk. 

Fried Oysters. — Select largest and finest 
oysters. Drain and wipe them by spread- 
ing upon cloth, laying another over them, 
pressing lightly. Roll each in beaten egg, 
then in cracker crumbs with which has been 
mixed a very little pepper. Fry in mixture of 
equal parts of lard and butter. 

Oysters Roasted in the Shell.— Wash and 

scrub the shells. Cook in hot oven, on top of 
stove, over red-hot coals, or in steamer until 
shells open. Always place them round shell 
down to retain juice. Serve melted butter and 
vinegar or lemons with them. 

Panned Oysters. — Pick over the opened 
oysters to remove bits of shell. Wash quickly 
in cold water and drain on sieve. Put into 
saucepan with 1 tablespoon butter for 25 oys- 
ters and a dash of salt and pepper. Cover 
and shake over a hot fire until edges ruffle 
and oysters are plump. May be served on toast. 

Stewed Oysters. — Pick over and wash 1 
quart oysters. Scald 1 pint milk. Strain, boil, 
and skim oyster liquor ; when clear add oysters. 
Cook till oysters are plump and well ruffled ; 
take from fire, add hot milk, salt, and pepper. 

If desired thicker, rub together 1 tablespoon 
each of butter and flour ; add to milk and stir 
until smooth. This may be varied by addition 
of a little chopped celery or onion. 

Creamed Oysters.— Prepare 1 cup thick 
cream sauce (see Sauces). Pan 1 pint cleaned 
eysters ; drain and add to sauce. Season with 
salt, pepper, pinch of mace, and few drops 
lemon juice. 

Scalloped Oysters. — Pick, wash, and drain 
1 solid quart oysters. Put in layers in baking- 



dish, alternating with dry bread or cracker 
crumbs and seasoning. When dish is filled add 
strained oyster liquor and sufficient milk to 
moisten. Cover with crumbs, add 1 tablespoon 
butter in bits, and bake Mt hour in hot oven. 

Broiled Oysters.— Pick, wash, and drain 
large oysters. Dip each in melted butter, roll 
in fine crumbs, and broil in fine wire broiler 
over a clear, hot fire. Serve on toast with 
sliced lemons. 

Pickled Oysters.— 2 gallons large oysters, 
drain and rinse them ; put 1 pint oyster juice 
in 1 quart vinegar over fire ; scald and skim 
until clear ; add I tablespoon whole pepper, 1 
tablespoon cloves, 1 tablespoon mace, 1 even 
tablespoon salt ; scald a minute, then throw in 
oysters ; let them just come to a boil. The 
oysters should be pickled day before being 
wanted, as they grow tough after standing a 
few days in vinegar. 

Oyster Pates. — 1 quart oysters, minced fine 
with a sharp knife ; 1 cup rich drawn butter 
based upon milk ; cayenne and black pepper to 
taste. Stir minced oysters in drawn butter 
and cook 5 minutes. Have ready some shapes 
of pastry, baked in pate^pans, then slipped out. 
Fill these with the mixture ; set in oven 2 min- 
utes to heat, and send to table. 

Oyster Pie. — 1 quart oysters, drained ; pep- 
per, salt, and butter to taste. 1 quart flour, 2 
tablespoons lard, 1 tablespoon salt, mix with 
water for pie crust. Butter plate, then bine

put over a crust and bake. 

Scallops in Batter. — Wash and dry large 
scallops. Dip each in fritter batter (see Frit- 
ters) and fry golden brown in smoking-hot fat. 

To Boil Lobsters or Crabs.— The lobster is 
in good season from April to December, and 
should be purchased alive and plunged into 
boiling water in which a good proportion of 
salt has been mixed. Continue to boil accord- 
ing to size about 20 minutes. Crabs should be 
boiled in the same manner, but a little more 
than half the time is necessary. 

Deviled Crabs. — 1 cup crab meat, picked 
from shells of well-boiled crabs, 2 tablespoons 
fine bread crumbs or rolled cracker, yolks two 
hard-boiled eggs chopped, juice of a lemon, Mt 
teaspoon mustard, a little cayenne pepper and 
salt, 1 cup good drawn butter. Mix 1 spoon 
crumbs with chopped crab meat, yolks, season- 
ing, drawn butter. Fill scallop shells — large 
clam shells will do — or small pat^-pans — with 
the mixture ; sift crumbs over top, heat to 
slight browning in quick oven. 

Soft Shell Crabs.— Fry in butter or lard. 

To Open a Boiled Lobster.— Wipe off shell, 
break off large claws ; separate tail from body ; 
take body from shell, leaving " lady," or 
stomach, on shell. Put aside green fat and coral ; 
remove small claws ; remove woolly gills from 
body, break latter through middle, and pick out 
meat from joints. Crush or cut under side of 
tail, draw meat from shell. Draw back flesh 
on upper end and pull off intestinal cord. 
Break edge of large claws and remove meat.

sherry ; cook 5 minutes ; add Mt cup cream 
beaten with yolks 2 eggs, stir till thickened. 
Take quickly from fire. 



Meats 

Broiling 

THE rules for roasting meat apply to broil- 
ing, except that instead of cooking it in 
the oven it is to be quickly browned, 
first on one side and then on the other, over a 
hot fire, and removed a little from the fire to 
finish cooking. Meat an inch thick will broil 
in about 4 minutes. It should be seasoned 
after it is cooked. 

Frying 
There are two distinct methods of frying: 
One with very little fat in the pan, to practise 
which successfully the pan and the fat must 
be hot before the article to be fried is put into 
it. For instance, in frying chops, if the pan 
is hot, and only fat enough is used to keep the 
chops from sticking to it, the heat being main- 
tained so that the chops cook quickly, they 
will be nearly as nice as if they were broiled. 
Frying by the other method consists in entirely 
immersing the article to be cooked in sufficient 
smoking-hot fat to cover it, and keeping the 
fat at that degree of heat until the food is 
brown. It should then be taken up with a 
skimmer and laid upon brown paper for a mo- 
ment to free it from grease. 

Boiling and Stewing 

Fresh meat for boiling should be put into 
boiling water and boiled very gently about 20 
minutes for each pound. A little salt, spice, 
or vegetables may be boiled in the water with 
the meat for seasoning. A little vinegar put 
in the water with tough meat makes it tender. 
The broth of boiled meat should always be 
saved to use in soups, stews, and gravies. 
Stewing and simmering meats means to place 
them near enough to the fire to keep the water 
on them bubbling moderately, constantly, and 
slowly. Salt meats should be put over the fire 
in cold water, which as soon as it boils should 
be replaced by fresh cold water, the water to 
be changed until it remains fresh enough to 
give the meat a palatable flavor when done. 
Salted and smoked meats require about 30 
minutes' very slow boiling, from the time the 
water boils, to each pound. Vegetables and 
herbs may be boiled with them to flavor them. 
When they are cooked the vessel containing 
them should be set where they will keep hot 
without boiling until required, if they are to 
be served hot ; if they are to be served cold, 
they should be allowed to cool in the pot liq- 
uor in which they were boiled. Very salt meats, 
or those much dried in smoking, 'should be 



Roasting 

Wipe meat with damp cloth. Trim and tie 
into shape if necessary. In the bottom of pan 
put some pieces of fat from meat. Arrange 
meat on rack in pan. Dredge with salt, pep- 
per, and flour. Have oven very hot at first ; 
when meat is half done reduce heat. Baste 
every 10 or 15 minutes. If there is danger 
of fat in pan being scorched add a few spoons 
of boiling water. Allow from 10 to 20 minutes 
per pound of meat, according as it is desired 
rare or well done. When done remove to hot 
platter. Thicken gravy in pan with browned 
flour, adding more water as necessary and add 
seasoning. 

Yorkshire Pudding. — 34 pint flour, 3 eggs, 
\V% pints milk, pinch salt, 1% teaspoons Royal 
Baking Powder. Sift flour and powder to- 
gether, add eggs, beaten with milk, stir quickly 
into rather thinner batter than for griddle 
cakes, pour into dripping-pan, plentifully 
greased with beef-dripping, bake in hot oven 
25 minutes ; serve with roast beef. 

Braised Beef. — Wipe and trim 6 pounds 
round or rump of beef without bone. Sear 
brown on all sides in very hot frying-pan over 
hot fire. In braising-pan or iron kettle put 
layers of sliced onions, turnips, and carrots ; 
add bunch of sweet herbs, 1 teaspoon salt, % 
teaspoon pepper ; on this lay meat. Add 1 pint 
boiling water (or water and stewed tomatoes). 
Cover closely and cook 4 hours in moderate 
oven. If water evaporates rapidly add more. 
Transfer meat to hot platter. Strain, thicken, 
and season gravy. The vegetables may be 
served separately if desired. 

Braised Veal Shoulder. — Have shoulder 
boned. Fill with stuffing (see Stuffings). Pre- 
pare bed of vegetables as for braised beef. 
Lay veal on it, add 1 pint boning water, 1 pint 
stewed tomatoes, M> teaspoon salt, V4 teaspoon 
pepper. Cover and cook 4 hours in moderate 
oven. Uncover and brown. Serve strained 
gravy separately. 

Broiled Steak. — Trim and wipe steak, which 
should be at least 1 inch thick. Rub broiler 
with fat, arrange steak with thickest part in 
center of broiler. Have fire clear and very 
hot, but without blaze. Hold steak close to fire. 
Turn every V2 minute, that it may sear quickly. 
When Mj done season with salt and pepper. 
Steak 1 inch thick will broil in 4 minutes. 

Panned Steak or Chops.— Trim and wipe 
steak. Heat frying-pan until it smokes all 
over. Rub bottom with a bit of fat. Lay in 
steak and turn every 10 seconds. Keep pan 
very hot. Season when ^ done. 

Mutton and pork chops, ham and bacon, may 
be panned in same way. , 

If hot platter for steak is rubbed with a cut 
onion it will give a delightful flavor to the meat. 

Broiled Ham and Poached Eggs.— Cut 
slices of boiled ham of equal size ; broil on a 
gridiron over a clear fire ; lay on a hot dish. 
Lay on each a poached egg, neatly trimmed, 
and serve. 

Beefsteak Pie (French style).— Take a 



soaked overnight in cold water before boiling. I nice piece of beef, rump or sirloin, cut in smal

slices ; slice also a little raw ham ; put both in 
a frying-pan, with some butter and small quan- 
tity chopped onions; let them simmer together 
a short time on the fire or in the oven ; add a 
little flour and enough stock to make sauce ; 
salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and a little Wor- 
cestershire sauce as seasoning ; add also a few 
sliced potatoes, and cook together for about 20 
minutes; put this into a pie-dish, with a few 
slices of hard-boiled eggs on the top, and cover 
with a layer of common paste. Bake from 15 
to 20 minutes in a well-heated oven. All dark- 
meat pies can be treated precisely in the same 
way. If poultry, leave the potatoes out. 

To Boil a Ham. — A blade of mace, a few 
cloves, a sprig of thyme, and 2 bay-leaves. Well 
soak ham in large quantity of water for 24 
hours, then trim and scrape very clean ; put 
into large stewpan, with more than sufficient 
water to cover it ; put in mace, cloves, thyme, 
and bay-leaves. Boil 4 or 5 hours, according 
to weight ; when done, let it become cold in 
liquor in which it was boiled. Then remove 
rind carefully, without injuring the fat ; press 
cloth over it to absorb as much of the grease 
as possible. It is always improved by setting 
in the oven for nearly an hour, till much of 
the fat dries out, and it also makes it more 
tender. Shake some bread raspings over the 
fat. Serve cold garnished with parsley. 

Boiled Mutton or Lamb. — Trim and wipe 
the meat. Have ready kettle of rapidly boiling 
salted water. Immerse meat, boil hard 5 min- 
utes, then reduce to gentle simmer. Allow 12 
to 15 minutes per pound. Lamb should always 
be well done ; mutton may be rare. A little 
rice may be added to water to keep meat white ; 
if a few vegetables are also added the pot liquor 
will make a good thick soup. 

Boiled Corned Beef and Turnips.— Select a 
piece not too salt. The brisket is a good cut 
for family use when not too fat. Cook beef in 
plenty cold water. Bring slowly to boil. Cook 
18 minutes to the pound after it begins to sim- 
mer. When fully % done put in a dozen tur- 
nips, peeled and quartered. When both beef 
and turnips are thoroughly done dish out the 
beef, and lay the turnips, unmashed, about it. 
Serve with drawn butter, having as a base the 
pot liquor. Remaining liquor will make a good 
soup for next day's dinner. 

Pork Chops with Tomato Gravy. — Trim 
off skin and fat; rub the chops over with a 
mixture of powdered sage and onion ; put 
small piece butter into a frying-pan ; put in 
the chops and cook slowly, as they should be 
well done. Lay chops on hot dish ; add a little 
hot water to gravy in pan, 1 large spoon 
butter rolled in flour, pepper, salt, and sugar, 
and Mi cup juice drained from can tomatoes. 
The tomatoes themselves can be used for a 
tomato omelet. Stew 5 minutes and pour over 
the chops and serve. 

Sausages. — Have % lean and l k fat pork 
chopped very fine, 1 pound salt, V* pound 
pepper, and teacup sage to every 40 pounds 
meat. Warm the meat, that you can mix it 
well with your hands, do up a part in small 
patties mixed with a little flour, the rest pack 
in jars. When to be used, do it up in small 
cakes, flour the outside, fry in butter or alone. 
They should not be covered while frying, or 
they will fall to pieces. They should be kept 



where it is cool, but not damp. To prevent 
sausages from bursting when cooking, never 
make a hole in them with a fork while turn- 
ing them. 

Fried Salt Pork. — Cut fat salt pork in thin 
slices and soak in milk for a few hours. Pour 
boiling water over, drain, and fry until crisp. 
When partly fried they may be dipped into 
batter (see Fritters), then finished in the same 
pan, turning several times. 

Pork and Beans. — Soak 1 quart white beans 
overnight in cold water. Drain, add fresh 
water, and simmer gently till tender. Put in 
baking-pan and place in center, rind up, gashed, 
Mj pound fat salt pork parboiled. Mix 1 tea- 
spoon salt, Mj teaspoon dry mustard, and 1 table- 
spoon molasses ; add to the beans, with enough 
boiling water to cover. Bake 8 hours in a 
moderate oven, adding more water as necessary. 

Liver and Bacon. — Cut liver in ^-inch 
slices, soak in cold water 20 minutes, drain, 
dry, and roll in flour. Have pan very hot. Put 
in bacon thinly sliced, turn until brown, trans- 
fer to hot platter. Fry liver quickly in the 
hot fat, turning often. When done pour off 
all but 1 or 2 tablespoons fat, dredge in flour 
until it is absorbed, and stir till brown. Add 
hot water gradually to make smooth gravy, 
season and boil 1 minute. Serve separately. 

Few people know that lamb's liver is as ten- 
der and well flavored as calf's liver ; it is much 
less expensive. 

Stew, Irish. — Time, about 2 hours. 2*6 
pounds chops, 8 potatoes, 4 turnips, 4 small 
onions, nearly a quart of water. Take some 
chops from loin of mutton, place them in a 
stewpan in alternate layers of sliced potatoes 
and chops ; add turnips and onions cut into 
pieces, pour in nearly quart cold water ; cover 
stewpan closely, let stew gently till vegetables 
are ready to mash and greater part of gravy is 
absorbed ; then place in a dish ; serve it up 
hot. 

Brown Beef Stew. — Cut 2 pounds beef in 
small pieces. Melt some of the fat in a pan, 
brown in it % the meat. Put rest of meat in 
kettle with 1 pint cold water, let stand 20 min- 
utes, then heat slowly. Transfer browned 
meat to kettle; thicken fat with two table- 
spoons browned flour, add 1 pint boiling water 
and stir ; when thick strain into kettle. Add 
1 cup diced carrot, cover, and simmer. When 
half done add 1 pint diced potatoes. Season 
well with salt and pepper. 

Mutton Haricot.— Cut 2 pounds breast 
mutton in pieces, roll in flour, and brown in 
drippings. Transfer to a stewpan, and 2 sliced 
onions, cover with boiling water, and simmer 
until very tender. Add 1 pint parboiled pota- 
toes or 1 pint boiled macaroni and 1 pint 
shelled peas ; season, simmer till vegetables 
are done. 

Brown Kidney Stew.— From a beef kidney 
cut off the outside meat in bits, rejecting tubes 
and purplish cores. Cover with cold water; 
heat slowly till steaming, drain, add cold water, 
and heat a second and again a third time. To 
the drained kidneys add 1 cup brown sauce 
(see Sauces), season very highly with Worces- 
tershire and catsup, and stand over hot water 
for 10 minutes.

bone. After they boil and scum is taken off, 
put in a little onion cut very fine — not enough 
to taste distinctly, just enough to flavor a lit- 
tle ; rub some parsley very fine when dry, or 
cut fine when green — this gives pleasant fla- 
vor. Season well with pepper and salt, and 
few ounces good fresh butter. When all is 
cooked well, have liquid enough to cover 
chicken, then beat 2 eggs and stir in some 
sweet cream. Line 5-quart pan with crust

them, let stand overnight ; then drain with a 
hair-sieve, and put in glass jars ; fill up jars 
with vinegar ; cover tight. 

Piccalilly. — 1 peck green tomatoes, sliced; 
% peck onions, sliced ; 1 cauliflower, 1 peck 
small cucumbers. Leave in salt and water 24 
hours ; then put in kettle with handful scraped 
horse-radish, 1 ounce turmeric, 1 ounce cloves 
(whole), x 4 pcund pepper (whole), 1 ounce 
cassia-buds or cinnamon, 1 pound white mus- 
tard seed, 1 pound English mustard. Place in 
kettle in layers, and cover with cold vinegar. 
Boil 15 minutes, constantly stirring. 

Pickled Red Cabbage. — Slice it into a col- 
ander, sprinkle each layer with salt; let it 
drain 2 days, then put into a jar, pour boiling 
vinegar enough to cover, put in a few slices of 
red beetroot. Choose purple red cabbage. 
Those who like flavor of spice will boil it with 
the vinegar. Cauliflower cut in bunches, and 
thrown in after being salted, will look red and 
beautiful. 

Tomato Catsup. — 1 gallon tomatoes 
(strained), 6 tablespoons salt, 3 tablespoons 
black pepper, 1 tablespoon cloves, 2 tablespoons 
cinnamon, 2 tablespoons allspice, lMi pints 
vinegar ; boil down one half. 1 peck tomatoes 
will make 1 gallon strained. 

Walnut Catsup.— Take green walnuts be- 
fore the shell is formed (usually in a proper 
state early in August). Grind them or pound 
them in an earthen or marble mortar. Squeeze 
out the juice through a coarse cloth, and add to 
every gallon of juice 1 pound of anchovies, 1 
pound salt, 4 ounces cayenne pepper, 2 ounces 
black pepper, 1 ounce each ginger, cloves, and 
mace, and the root of one horse-radish. Boil all 
together till reduced to half the quantity. 
Pour off, and when cold bottle tight. Use in 3 
months. 



Beverages 



BOILED COFFEE. -For 4 heaping table- 
spoons ground coffee allow 1 quart 
freshly boiling water and Mi white 1 raw 
egg. Mix the egg white with 3 tablespoons 
cold water, beating with fork. Add coffee and 



stir till well wet. Scald coffee-pot, put in pre- 
pared coffee. Pour in boiling water, cover 
spout, and boil 5 minutes. Pour in quickly 
V4 cup cold water, let stand 3 minutes to set- 
tle. Strain into hot pot or have strainer on 
table. 

Coffee for Six Persons.— Take 1 full cup 
ground coffee, 1 egg, a little cold water ; stir 
together, add 1 pint boiling water, boil up ; 
then add another pint boiling water, and set 
back to settle before serving. 

French Coffee. — 1 quart water to 1 cup very 
fine ground coffee. Put coffee grounds in 
bowl ; pour over about Mi pint cold water and 
let stand for 15 minutes ; bring remaining 
water to a boil. Take coffee in bowl, strain 
through fine sieve, then take French coffee- 
pot, put coffee grounds in strainer at top 
of French pot, leaving water in bowl. Then 
take boiling water and pour over coffee very 
slowly. Then set coffee-pot on stove 5 min- 
utes ; must not boil. Take off and pour in 
cold water from bowl that coffee was first 
soaked in, to settle. Serve in another pot. 
The French, who have the reputation of mak- 
ing the best coffee, use 3 parts Java, 1 part 
Mocha. 

Vienna Coffee. — Equal parts Mocha and 
Java coffee ; allow 1 heaping tablespoon of 
coffee to each person, and 2 extra to make good 
strength. Mix 1 egg with grounds, pour on 
coffee Mi as much boiling water as will be 
needed, let coffee froth, then stir down grounds 
and let boil 5 minutes ; then let coffee stand 
where it will keep hot, but not boil, for 5 or 
10 minutes, and add rest of water. To 1 pint 
cream add white of an egg, well beaten ; this 
is to be put in cups with sugar, and hot coffee 
added. 

Tea. — Water for tea should be freshly 
heated and just boiling. Teas are of differing 
strengths, but a safe rule is 1 teaspoon dry tea 
to Mi pint boiling water. Scald tea-pot ; put in 
dry tea and cover for 1 minute. Add boiling 
water, cover closely. Let stand 3 to 6 min- 
utes, strain off into second hot pot. A wadded 
cozy will keep tea hot for a long time off the 
fire. 

Cocoa. — The usual rule is 1 teaspoon cocoa 
to each cup. Mix dry cocoa with little cold 
water, add scalded milk or boiling water, and 
boil 1 minute. 

Chocolate. — 1 square unsweetened choco- 
late, 1 tablespoon sugar, 2 tablespoons hot wa- 
ter. Grate chocolate, boil all together till 
smooth, add gradually 1 pint scalded milk, 
cook in double boiler 5 minutes. Some like 
to add 1 teaspoon vanilla. It can be made 
stronger by using more chocolate. 



Cookery for the Sick 

ALWAYS prepare food for the sick in the 
neatest and most careful manner. In 
L sickness the senses are unusually acute, 
and far more susceptible to carelessness, neg- 
ligence, and mistakes in the preparation and 
serving of food than when in health.

THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER IS ABSOLUTELY PURE. 



ROYAL 

A STRICTLY PURE, CREAM OF TARTAR BAKING POWDER 

THE tests made by the Government chemists show that Royal 
Baking Powder is of the highest efficiency and usefulness as a 
leavening agent ; that it does not contain alum, ammonia, or lime, and 
is absolutely pure. The official tests by the various State Food Com- 
missions, Boards of Health, and official analysts show no other baking 
powder so pure, strong, and healthful. 

More ill health and physical discomfort result from unwholesome 
food than from any other one cause, and chief among unwholesome 
foods are the alum and other cheaply made baking powders. 

The market is full of low-grade powders, mostly made from burnt 
alum and phosphatic acid. The sale of these powders is urged by some 
dealers because they are bought cheap at wholesale and yield them 
large profits. Consumers should ash for Royal and take no substitute. 

Alum baking powders are classed as poisonous by the most eminent 
physicians. They cost but three cents a pound to make, and being sold 
at from twenty to forty cents, are also a commercial fraud. They cause 
indigestion, heartburn, dyspepsia, and diseases of the liver and kidneys. 
Consumers who value their health must be on their guard against 
these dangerous powders. It will be safer in all cases to demand the 
Royal and take no other. 

The housewife will find no possible substitute for the Royal Baking 
Powder. There is no other baking powder or preparation that will 
render the food so excellent in every quality. 

Instead of cream of tartar and soda, or soda and sour milk, the 
best housekeepers now use Royal Baking Powder. It is almost impos- 
sible for the housekeeper to procure pure cream of tartar. Professor 
Chandler, when president of the New York Board of Health, stated in 
an official report that he found upon investigation that nearly all the 
cream of tartar sold by grocers was adulterated with white clay, alum, 
or other hurtful substance. These ingredients are dangerous to health, 
impoverishing the blood, producing dyspepsia, etc. Professor Chandler 
strongly recommends the use of a well-known baking powder (like the 
Royal) in aU kinds of baking as more convenient, economical, and 
healthful. 

Royal Baking Powder is sold only in securely labeled tin cans. 

Remember, in all old receipts where cream of tartar and soda or 
saleratus are called for, you can substitute Royal Baking Powder and 
get better results. 

The usual proportions, old way, are : 2 teaspoonfuls cream of tartar 
to 1 of soda or saleratus ; 

Instead of which use 2 teaspoonfuls op Royal Baking Powder, 
and mix it with the flour while dry. This powder is so pure and per- 
fectly combined that one third less will do better work. 

Never use so-called prepared or self-raising flours. They 
mostly contain alum, phosphates, or other injurious ingredients. 



THE OFFICIAL TESTS 

SHOW ROYAL BAKING POWDER SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHERS 

The United States Government, after elaborate tests, reports the Royal Baking Powder 
a pure cream of tartar powder of greater leavening strength than any other. 

Bulletin 13, U. S. Ag. Dep., p. 599. 

The Canadian official tests, recently made, show the Royal B aking Powder highest of all 
in leavening strength. Bulletin 10, Inland Rev. Dep., p. 16. 

The Royal Baking Powder is superior to any other powder which I have examined; a 
baking powder unequaled for purity, strength, and wholesomeness. 

Willis G. Tucker, M.D., Ph.D., New York State Analyst 

As the excellence of a baking powder is dependent upon the yield of leavening gas, and 
upon the wholesomeness and purity of its ingredients, the Royal is unquestionably the best. 

Massachusetts State Analyst 

The best baking powder made is, as shown by analysis, the Royal. 

Cyrus Edson, BLD., Com'r of Health, New York City. 

I find the Royal Baking Powder superior to all the others in every respect. It is purest 
and strongest. Walter S. Haines, M.D., Consulting Chemist, 

Chicago Board of Health. 

Our test shows that Royal Baking Powder has greater leavening power than any other 
of which we have knowledge. W. B. Rising, State Analyst, California. 

I have from time to time analyzed the Royal Baking Powder, and have uniformly found it 
to be high in leavening power and to be composed of pure ingredients. 

H. A. Weber, State Analyst, Ohio. 

My tests show the Royal Baking Powder of very superior leavening power; a cream of 
tartar powder of the highest purity, containing no alum, lime, ammonia, or any unwhole- 
some material. R. C. Kedzie, late State Analyst, Michigan. 

Royal Baking Powder is composed of the best and purest ingredients. It is absolutely 
pure, with perfect keeping qualities, and as strong as such a powder can be made. Royal 
makes the food much finer, besides assuring its perfect healthfulness. 

G. N. Failure, Kansas State Chemist. 

I have submitted the Royal Baking Powder to careful chemical tests, and find it to be 
perfectly free from any substance in any way deleterious or injurious. 

H. A. Huston, Indiana State Chemist. 

Royal Baking Powder is free from alum and every adulteration, and it has a larger amount 
of leavening gas than any of the others analyzed. M A. Scovell, 

Director Kentucky AgL Exp. Station. 

I have made a large number of analyses of Royal Baking Powder, and have found it to be 
an absolutely pure cream of tartar powder, entirely free from alum, ammonia, and all adultera- 
tions and impurities. In leavening power it is of the very highest. 

Charles W. Drew, late State Chemist, Minnesota. 

In this market I find but one powder besides Royal made from cream of tartar. Royal is 
the strongest, purest, most economical. H. H. Nicholson, Nebraska State Chemist. 

I find the Royal to be absolutely pure and highest in leavening power. 

Albert Menke, Arkansas State Chemist. 

From actual analysis made by me, I pronounce the Royal Baking Powder to be the 
strongest and purest Baking Powder before the public. W. T. Wenzell, 

Analyst San Francisco Board of Health. 

The Royal Baking Powder is superior in regard to purity, leavening power, and keeping 
qualities. Geo. S. Cox, State Chemist, Wisconsin. 

I allow no baking powder other than the Royal to be used in my kitchen, for I know it to 
be absolutely pure and all that is claimed for it. 

Wm. T. Cutter, Connecticut State Chemist 

The Royal was found the highest in leavening strength, and the best powder analyzed. 

George F. Payne, State Chemist, Georgia. 

There is no baking powder known to us equal to the Royal We confidently recommend 
it for purity and wholesomeness. W. Q. Webb, H.D., , 

President Board of Health, Spokane, Washington. 

Royal Baking Powder has been found by every examination— official or competitive— 
to be the highest of ALL in leavening power, and of absolute purity and wholesomeness.

Royal Baking Powder has greater raising power than any other leavening 
agent. The London city analyst reports that each ounce of Royal evolves 
157 cubic inches of leavening gas. This shows a practical usefulness greatly 
in excess of other powders, and three times more than many of the raising 
flours or powders, or that an ounce or a teaspoonful of Royal Baking Powder 
will make light three times more cake, bread, or other food than the ordi= 
nary preparations. The great economy in the use of the Royal will be appar= 
ent to every housewife. ^ ^ ^ The genuine Royal is made in America. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS; 

MUST BE CAREFULLY READ BY EVERY ONE USING THIS BOOK 



HINTS ON BAKING. — To achieve perfect success, the cook must use judgment, dis- 
crimination, and care. Some flour requires more moisture, i. e., water or milk, than 
others ; so that the quantity may have to be varied to make dough of a proper con- 
sistency. Different bakings will vary as to time and heat required, and should, therefore, be 
examined occasionally. To ascertain whether the bread is sufficiently done in the centre of 
the loaf or cake, thrust a skewer into it. If done, there will be no dough on the skewer when 
drawn out. Measure the flour, and be careful to mix with it the baking powder in a dry state, 
atid before sieving. You can generally substitute water for milk, or milk for water ; butter for 
lard, or lard for butter. The number of eggs may be increased or diminished, or, in plainer 
cake, etc., dispensed with entirely. Where fewer eggs are used than directed, always use a 
little more baking powder. Never use sour milk or " prepared " or " self-raising" flour. 

When about to cut new bread or cake, heat the knife ; this will prevent its crumbling. 

CAKE BAKING. — For a plain cake made with one pound of flour. Royal Baking Powder, 
etc., the time to be allowed in baking would be about I hour ; at the outside not more than 
IV4 hours. Very rich cakes, in which butter and eggs predominate, take, of course, very 
much longer time to bake, a pound cake of equal weight taking from 1 Ms to 2 hours. On 
no account should an oven be too hot when the cake is put in — that is, hot enough to 
brown at once ; if so, the outside will be burned before the interior is sufficiently baked. 
The old plan of feeling the handle of the oven door to test the heat is not always success- 
ful; it is better to sprinkle a little flour inside and shut the door for about 3 minutes; if 
at the end of that time it is of a rich light brown, the cake may be put in, but if burned the 
heat must be reduced. 

In baking loaf cake, remember that unless you place a piece of paper over for protection at 
first, a top crust will be formed at once that prevents the raising. When cake is well raised 
remove the paper for browning on top. 

ADVICE TO THE COOK. — Great cleanliness, as well as care and attention, is required 
from a cook. Keep your hands very clean ; don't " scatter" in your kitchen ; clean up as you 
go ; put scalding water into each saucepan or stewpan as you have done using it. Dry your 
saucepans before you put them on the shelf. Never scrub the inside of a frying- or omelet- 
pan ; rub it with paper ; wipe it out well with a cloth afterward. Wash your pudding-cloths ; 
scald and hang them to dry directly after using them ; air them before you put them away, 
or they will be musty ; keep in dry place. Be careful not to use a knife that has cut onions 
till it has been cleaned. Keep sink and sink-brush very clean. Be careful never to throw 
anything but water down sink. Do not throw cabbage water down it ; throw it away out of 
doors ; its smell is very bad. Never have sticky plates or dishes ; use very hot water for 
washing them ; when greasy, change it. Clean coppers with vinegar or turpentine and fine 
brick-dust, rubbed on with flannel ; polish them with chamois and a little dry brick-dust. 
Clean your tins with soap and whiting mixed, made into a thick cream with hot water. Rub 
it on with flannel ; when dry, rub off with clean cloth and dry whiting. Take care that you look 
at the meat the butcher brings, to see that it is good. Let there be no waste in the kitchen. 



Bread and Rolls 

BREAD was first made without leaven, 
heavy and solid. Then yeast was dis- 
covered, and yeast-risen bread came into 
use throughout the civilized world. Finally 
baking powder was devised, the most health- 
ful, economical, and convenient of all leaven- 
ing or lightening agents. 

Yeast is a living plant. Mixed with the 
dough it causes fermentation and destruction 
of a part of the flour, and this produces car- 



bonic-acid gas. The bubbles of this gas be- 
come entangled in the dough, swelling it up 
and making it spongy. In this process, how- 
ever, a part of the most nutritious elements of 
the flour (estimated at ten per cent. ) is destroyed 
in producing the leavening gas; there is al- 
ways danger of sourdough, and there is a delay 
of many hours for the sponge to rise. 

Perfect bread is that in which the wheat or 
other grain is transposed into an available food 
without loss of any of its valuable properties. 

Royal Baking Powder is now used largely in

place of yeast to leaven bread. It does pre- 
cisely the same work — that is, inflates the 
dough and makes it porous and spongy. But 
the process is not destructive: the baking 
powder itself produces the leavening gas. 
No part of the flour is decomposed or de- 
stroyed. Moreover, there is no mixing or 
kneading with the hands, no setting of sponge 
overnight, as the loaf is mixed and ready for 
the oven at once. Bread thus made cannot 
become sour, but will retain its moisture and 
freshness, and may be eaten while hot or fresh 
without distress even by persons of delicate 
digestion. 

The ease with which Royal Baking Powder 
bread is made, its cleanliness and wholesome- 
ness, have caused it to supersede yeast bread 
with many of the best pastry cooks. 

In making this bread the materials and uten- 
sils should be brought together before the 
mixing of the dough is begun. The fire must 
be looked to so as to secure a steady, moderate 
heat. Remember to mix the flour and Royal 
Baking Powder together before sieving, and 
TtiiY thoroughly before wetting. 

Royal Baking Powder Bread. — 1 quart 
flour, 1 teaspoon salt, Vi teaspoon sugar, 2 
heaped teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, half 
medium-sized cold boiled potato, and water. 
Sieve together thoroughly flour, salt, sugar, 
and baking powder ; rub in the potato ; add 
sufficient water to mix smoothly and rapidly 
into a moist dough ; about a pint of water to 
a quart of flour will be required — more or less 
according to the brand and quality of the flour 
used. Do not make a stiff dough, as for yeast 
bread. Put the dough into a greased bread- 
tin, 4Vfe by 8 inches, and 4 inches deep, filling 
about 3 parts. The loaf when baked will 
rise to fill the tin. Bake in very hot oven about 
45 minutes, placing paper over first 15 min- 
utes' baking, to prevent crusting too soon on 
top. Bake immediately after mixing. 

Household Bread. — Sieve twice together 1 
quart flour, I teaspoon salt, 2 heaped teaspoons 
Royal Baking Powder. Make a well in the cen- 
tre ; add gradually sufiicient cold liquid — wa- 
ter, milk, or equal quantities of each — to mix 
to a stiff batter or soft dough ; this wiU require 
about 1 pint of liquid. Turn at once into a 
greased bread-tin, and bake immediately in a 
moderate oven about 1 hour. 

Qraham Unfermented Bread. — His pints 
Graham flour (whole meal), Mi pint wheaten 
flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tea- 
spoons Royal Baking Powder. 1 V4 pints mUk, or

sugar, salt, and baking powder ; add the milk ; 
mix into smooth dough that can be erjily 
handled. Flour the board, turn out dough, give 
it a quick, vigorous additional kneading to com- 
plete its smoothness ; then divide in four 
large pieces, which form in long loaves, lay 
them just touching into a square shallow cake- 
tin, brush them over with milk. Bake in rather 
hot oven 30 minutes. When removing from 
oven rub them over with a little butter. 

Entire Wheat Bread. — 1 quart entire wheat 
flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, 2 tear 
spoons Royal Baking Powder. Mix all well

rye flour, 1 teaspoon moist sugar, 1 teaspoon 
salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 1 table- 
spoon lard, % pint milk. Sieve together maize 
flour, rye flour, sugar, salt, and baking pow- 
der. Rub in the lard ; add the milk, and mix 
the whole into a batter-like mixture. Pour 
into greased tin, and bake 40 minutes in rather 
hot oven. Protect at first with paper. 

Boston Brown Bread. — Vfe pint flour, 1 
pint maize flour, % pint rye flour, 2 potatoes, 1 
teaspoon salt. 1 tablespoon moist sugar, 2 tea- 
spoons Royal Baking Powder, ^ pint water. 
Sieve flour, maize flour, rye flour, sugar, salt, 
and baking powder together thoroughly ; peel, 
wash, and boil well 2 mealy potatoes, rub them 
through sieve, diluting with water. When this 
is quite cold, use it to mix with the flour, etc., 
into batter-like consistency; put it into well- 
greased bread-tin with lid. Place it in sauce- 
pan % full of boiling water, where the loaf 
will simmer 1 hour, without water getting into 
it. Remove, take off cover, finish by baking in 
a fairly hot oven 30 minutes.

smoothly into a rather 
firm dough. Flour the 
board, turn out the 
dough, give it 1 or 2 
turns to complete its 
smoothness. Divide it 
in equal portions about 
the size of an egg ; again 
divide these in half, 
which shape in small 
rolls. Lay them on 
greased baking-tin so 
that they do not touch. 
Bake in hot oven for 
about 10 minutes. When 
nearly baked brush them 
over with milk. 



One of the great advantages 
of using Eoyal Baking Povfder 
is that it makes cooking easy. 
With this baking powder ex- 
act measurements of ingredi- 
ents to the very ounce are not 
essential. Royal assures good 
work in the hands of the nov- 
ice, or when haste is impera- 
tive ; and, even if some of the 
materials used are not exactly 
the right proportions, will give 
satisfactory results. A quart 
of flour, or sixteen ounces, or 
four cups, all mean the same 
thing. Sometimes one ex- 
pression is used, sometimes 
another. The more accurately 
the receipts are followed the 
better will be the results ; if 
you do not always succeed to 
your liking, remember that 
practice makes perfect. But 
with ordinary care and mod- 
erate attention and intelli- 
gence, provided the baking 
powder is not forgotten alto- 
gether, good food is easily 
and readily made. 



Graham Rolls. — 1 pint whole meal, 1 pint 
ordinary flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons 
Royal Baking Powder, 1 tablespoon lard, ^4 pint 
milk. Sieve together whole meal, flour, salt, 
and baking powder; rub in lard; add mUk, 
and mix the whole into smooth dough that can 
be handled; turn it out on a floured board, and 
form in rolls shape and size of large, even- 
sized fingers. Lay them on baking-sheet about 
% inch apart. Brush their surfaces with 
Bake in hot oven from 
10 to 15 minutes. 

Note. — Graham bread, 
or Graham flour, takes 
its name from Dr. Gra- 
ham who first advocated 
the use of flour from the 
whole grain, made with- 
out bolting or the sepa- 
ration of the bran from 
the finer parts of the 
flour. Graham flour is 
the same as " whole 
meal," and in these re- 
ceipts the terms are used 
synonomously. 



Lunch Rolls. — 1 quart 
flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 
teaspoons Royal Baking 
Powder, 1 tablespoon 
lard, 1 pint milk. Sieve 
together flour, salt, and 
baking powder; rub in 
lard; add the milk, 
and mix to a smooth 
dough that can be easily 
handled. Flour the 
board, turn out dough, 
give it several quick 
kneadings to insure 
smoothness. Roll out 
little over ^ inch thick, 
stamp out with round 
cutter about 2^2 inches 
in diameter ; lay them 
on greased balung-tin, 
just touching (in rows 
evenly), bake in fairly hot oven for about 25 
minutes. Brush them over with milk when 
taken from oven. 

French Rolls.— Make dough as for lunch 
rolls. Knead on board. Divide in pieces 
size of an egg. Form each in a short, thick, 
tapering roll. Put together by twos, side by 
side, pinching ends together a little. Place on 
flat, greased tins. Brush with mUk. Bake in 
very hot oven. 

These rolls may be moulded in different 
forms, braided or folded together, or shaped 
in crescents or horseshoes. 

Bread sticks may be made by the same rule, 
taking small portions of the dough and form- 
ing with the hands in pencil-shaped rolls. 
Brush these over with milk and bake from 
10 to 15 minutes in a fairly hot oven. 



Milk Rolls.— V4 pound 
flour, *4 pound maize 
flour, '4 pint milk, 2 
ounces butter,! teaspoon 
Royal Baking Powder. 
Sieve together the flour, 
maize flour, and baking 
powder, rub in butter, 
add gradually the milk. 
Mix thoroughly and 
knead lightly. Shape 
into even-sized rolls, 
place them on baking- 
sheet, brush with milk 
and bake. 

Fruit Rolls.— Mix to- 
gether 1 quart flour, 1 
teaspoon salt, 2 table- 
spoons sugar, 2 tea- 
spoons Royal Baking 
Powder ; rub in 2 table- 
spoons butter. Cut "4 
pound citron finely, seed 
and halve "4 pound rai- 
sins. Mix fruit evenly 
with dry ingredients, 
mix to a firm dough with 
milk. Knead on board 
for a moment, divide in 
pieces size of egg, make in long rolls, lay 1 inch 
apart on flat, greased tins, bnish with milk.

Hot Biscuits, Scones, Cakes, 
and Muffins 

EXPERIENCED housekeepers agree that 
breakfast is difficult to cater for. Even 
the appetite ordinarily easy to satisfy is 
likely to be captious when approaching the 
first meal of the day. Every article of food 
upon the breakfast-table, therefore, should be 
perfect — the coffee as clear as amber, th6

bacon white and crisp, the biscuits flaky, ten- 
der, delicious. 

Hot rolls, cakes, and biscuits are the main- 
stay of the American breakfast, and they 
might, with advantage, be introduced more 
frequently into the English menu. Many of 
the following receipts are of American origin, 
and no doubt will prove most acceptable to 
those of our readers who are familiar with the 
hot, crisp, light rolls, and flaky biscuits, in the 
manufacture of which our transatlantic cousins 
so greatly excel. And to those to whom they 
are unknown we would specially recommend 
them as a means of introducing considerable 
variety to the breakfast-table with a compara- 
tively small outlay of time and money. 

With a basis of flour, salt, and Royal Baking 
Powder, we may add other ingredients to vary 
and enrich the cakes and biscuits generally 
known to the housewife, and produce in al- 
most endless variety breakfast and luncheon 
foods that shall be dainty and delicious or 
substantial and hearty. 

When eggs are scarce, or if too much shortr 
ening disagrees with some member of the 
family, Royal Baking Powder permits the les- 
sening of both or either of these ingredients, 
without impairing the dehcacy or digestibility 
of the finished biscuit. 

Royal Baking Powder is pure and wholesome, 
and its use in excess can produce no harm ; yet 
it is best to be guided by the quantity specified 
in the receipts. Baking powder could be added 
until a dry, powdery biscuit resulted. 

The mixing of the baking powder, floiu-, and 
other dry ingredients should be thorough. 
This is imperative if a delicate, evenly lea- 
vened biscviit is wanted. The other ingredients 
may then be added, following the special direc- 
tions as given in each receipt. 

In using shortening for biscuits, especially 
through the winter season, with some limita- 
tions good, sweet, home-made lard may take the 
place of butter. Butter will colour the biscuits 
slightly yellow ; lard will whiten them. This 
substitution will not do when a large quantity 
of shortening is called for. 

Biscuits are mixed to a soft dough, which is 
turned out, patted down, or rolled to a proper 
thickness, and then cut out and baked. From 
long experience it has been found that the re- 
sult is much better and the food more di- 
gestible when the finished biscuit is small 
and not too thick. The scientific reason for 
this is that the oven heat necessary for bis- 
cuits, if they are made very large, will brown 
the outside before the centre is as thoroughly 
baked as it should be. The dough should be 
rolled about % inch thick ; the biscuits should 
be of medium size, — 2 inches or less across, — 
and placed slightly apart in the pans. A good 
oven heat wiU bake them perfectly in from 15 



them without fear of consequences. The bis- 
cuit may, of course, be made thicker or thin- 
ner, as more or less of the soft inside part may 
be preferred, but the time of baking must be 
regulated accordingly. 

The same directions will apply to hot baking 
powder breads made with a batter. If baked 
in a sheet the batter should rarely be more 
than an inch deep in the pan, sometimes less ; 
if in cups or moulds they should not be more 
than % full. This allows the heat to penetrate 
the mixture quickly; the moisture and heat 
cause the baking powder to act; each tiny 
grain of the powder acts on the materials sur- 
rounding it ; the dough or batter expands, then 
is stiffened by the heat, and all the starch 
grains are thoroughly and evenly cooked. 

Royal Hot Biscuit. — 1 quart flour, 1 tea- 
spoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 
1 tablespoon lard or butter, 1 pint sweet mUk, 
cold (never use sour milk) ; use cold water 
when milk cannot be obtained. Sieve together 
flour, salt, and baking powder ; rub in shorten- 
ing; add milk; form into smooth, consistent 
dough. Flour the board, turn out dough, roll 
out to thickness of % inch, cut with small 
round cutter, 1% inches to 2 inches in di- 
ameter ; lay them close together on greased 
baking-tin ; bake in good hot oven. Cold bis- 
cuit can be made fresh by moistening and pla- 
cing in oven until heated through. 

Breakfast Biscuit. — Take 1 quart sweet 
milk, % cup melted butter, a little salt, 2 tea- 
spoons Royal Baking Powder, flour enough to 
make a stiff batter ; do not knead into dough, 
but drop into buttered tins from a spoon ; bake 
in a hot oven — unless it is hot they wiU not 
be light and tender. 

Egg Biscuit. — Mix and sieve well together 1 
pint flour, li teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 
teaspoon Royal Baking Powder. Beat 1 egg, 
add Ml cup milk, stir into dry mixture, adding

Turn out on board, knead for a moment, cut 
in circles, place 1 inch apart on greased pans. 
Brush with little beaten egg, and bake in very 
hot oven. 

Sandwich Biscuit. — Sieve together 1 pint 
flour, % teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon Royal Bak- 
ing Powder. Rub in 1 heaped tablespoon but- 
ter. Mix to a soft dough with milk. Roll out 
% inch thick. Cut in rounds. On Mi of the 
rounds spread a little soft butter, add a thick 
layer of finely chopped and seasoned cold meat; 
cover with remaining rounds and press to- 
gether. Brush tops with milk, place 1 inch 
apart on greased tins, and bake in hot oven. 

Scones.— Ml pound flour, 1 ounce castor 
sugar. 2 ounces currants or sultanas, 1 gUl 
milk, 2 ounces butter, l^^ level teaspoons Royal 
Baking Powder, a small pinch salt. Dry and 
sieve the flour ; add the salt ; rub in the butter 
till the mixture resembles oatmeal ; mix the 
baking powder with the sugar and add to the 
flour; then add the currants (well cleaned), 
stir in the milk, and work to a smooth dough. 
Divide in small scones or rounds, flatten with 
the palm of the hand on a floured board, place 



to 20 nmiutes, and even a dyspeptic may eat

Fritters and Waffles 

FRITTERS are served as a vegetable or 
a sweet, for lunch, dinner, or supper, 
according to the ingredients used in mak- 
ing them. Whether sweet or plain, the foun- 
dation batter is much the same, and receipts 
given below can be used for many kinds of 
fritters, By the use of Royal Baking Powder a 



fritter batter may be stirred up in a moment, 
and a menu which it may be thought necessary 
to extend can be supplemented by the addition 
of a delicate and tasty dish. 

A fritter batter which is to be used as a 
medium for whole or sliced fruit should not be 
too thin, as it is to serve as a cover for the 
fruit. When chopped fruits or vegetables are 
stirred in, or the batter is to be used plain, it 
should be thick enough to retain its shape 
when dropped by spoonfuls into the frying- 
kettle. The fat should be deep enough to 
cover the fritters, and it should be smoking 
liot when used. Most fritters are done within 
5 minutes, the time needed to cook them 
being determined by one which should be 
cooked to test the heat of the fat. 

The very word "waffles" brings to our 
minds a host of pleasant recollections. The 
chief drawback, in the old days, was that they 
must be started so long before they were 
ready for the irons, for home-made yeast took 
time to raise the batter to the requisite degree 
of lightness. Now, by the use of Royal Bak- 
ing Powder, they can be prepared in 5 min- 
utes. They ai-e better than of old, too, for 
there is no yeasty taste to them; they are 
Ught, tender, and palatable, and, what is most 
important, entirely digestible and wholesome.

powder ; add the oil and salt by degrees, stir 
in the water. Beat thoroughly till quite 
smooth and let stand for half an hour. Whisk 
the egg-white to a stiff froth and amalgamate. 
The batter is then ready, and can be used for 
all kinds of fish, meat, or for fruit fritters ; or 

Two ounces flour. 1 teaspoon Royal Baking 
Powder, sieved together, 2 tablespoons cream, 
1 teaspoon castor sugar, M2 ounce butter 
(melted), a pinch of salt, 1 whole and 1 yolk of 
egg. Put the flour and baking powder into a 
basin, add the salt and sugar, stir in the cream 
and the yolks of eggs ; beat well for some

Griddle Cakes, Etc. 

THE griddle cake as made to-day with 
Royal Baking Powder is another article 
of food which is received with high fa- 
vor wherever its merits are known. The heavy, 
sour, grease-soaked, indigestible griddle cake 
of old is, where modern methods are employed, 
a thing of the past. The properly made griddle 
cake is a delicious food, wholesome, appetizing, 
and nutritious. 

Raising the griddle cake with yeast is alto- 
gether obsolete with expert cooks. Mixtures 
of soda, sour milk, buttermilk, etc., are like- 
wise not permissible. Royal Baking Powder 
has altogether redeemed the griddle cake. It 
makes the cake light, tender, digestible, and 
its preparation and baking are the work of a 
few moments only. 

Royal Baking Powder, plain, sweet milk, 
flour, and a Uttle salt make a food fit for a 
feast. What so simple, so easily prepared ? 
Eggs are altogether unessential. 

The batter must be thin, the cakes made 
small and not too thick, — about a good % inch 
thick when baked, — browned, and neatly 
turned. The griddle must be merely rubbed 
with grease, not grease-soaked. This is highly 
important. Take a thick piece of salt pork 
on a fork, or a lump of suet in a piece of 
cheese-cloth, and rub lightly over the hot 
griddle, and pour the batter on immediately. 
Do not use so-called "prepared" or "self- 
raising " flours. 

Remember that buckwheat is one of the 
most difficult flours to lighten. Where it 
is used for griddle cakes this fact must be 
recognized and a somewhat larger proportion 
of Royal Baking Powder allowed. Made in 
the manner directed in these receipts buck- 
wheat cakes can be safely and profusely eaten 
by every one. 

Royal Wheat Cakes. — This is the best 
plain, hot griddle cake made without eggs.

buttered baking-tin; fast as browned, lay 
them on it, and spread raspberry jam over 
them; then bake more, which lay on others 
already done. Repeat this until you have 
used jam twice, then bake another batch, 
which use to cover them. Dredge plentifully 
with sugar, place in a moderate oven to finish 
cooking.

Royal Buckwheats. — When properly made 
this is the most delicious of all the griddle 
cakes. Buckwheat cakes, when made from 
yeast or risen overnight, were diflicult to make 
light and sweet, and were unwholesome. It is 
found that by the use of the Royal Baking 
Powder to raise the batter these objections 
have been entirely overcome, and that buck- 
wheat cakes are made a most delicious food, 
light, sweet, tender, and perfectly wholesome, 
which can be eaten by any one without the 
slightest digestive inconvenience. 2 cups pure 
buckwheat (do not use the so-called " pre- 



pared" or " self-raising" flours), 1 cup wheat 
flour, 2 tablespoons Royal Baking Powder, \^

Cakes 

Flour 

FANCY-CAKE makers and confectioners 
prefer to use " pastry" flour for making 
cakes and pastry, which is a flour of 
different grade from that used for bread and 
general baking purposes. Bread flour contains 
a large proportion of gluten, the nitrogenous 
property of the wheat grain, which gives bone 
and muscle, and makes bread a nutritous food. 
When bread flour is used for cake and pie- 
crust the result is not quite as flaky and light 
as it should be, because of the gluten in the 
flour. A special sack of pastry flour for use 
in making fine cakes and pastry will be ad- 



THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER IS ABSOLUTELY PURE.

vantageous. In appearance pastry flour is 
whiter tlian bread flour. When rubbed be- 
tween the fingers, it feels as soft and fine as 
corn-flour; if squeezed in the hand it forms 
a firm ball. Because of this tendency to 
" pack "it should always be sieved very thor- 
oughly. 

Generally speaking, Royal Baking Powder 
used with any good flour vdll make cake which 
will be creditable and satisfactory to any 
housekeeper. 

Royal Baking Powder 

In no department of cookery is Royal Bak- 
ing Powder of greater usefulness than in 
making fine cake. Eggs are too expensive 
nowadays to be used so lavishly as they were 
a generation ago, ten or more to a cake. Not 
as a substitute wholly, but as an accessory, do 
we use the Royal Baking Powder ; and we find 
that it enables us to dispense with part of the 
eggs, at the same time giving equal lightness 
and greater digestibility to the food. We there- 
by obtain uniformly good results and do a large 
amount of work at a minimum expense. The 
quantity of baking powder called for by the 
receipt should be thoroughly mixed with the 
flour before the latter is sieved. 

The Royal Baking Powder has worked a 
revolution in cake-making. It is now no 
trouble to make at home, in almost endless 
variety, cakes which for delicacy and beauty 
rival the finest productions of the confectioner. 
If you follow the directions here given there 
will be no spoiled or heavy cakes, no wasted 
materials through failures in mixing or 
baking. 

An earthenware basin and wooden spoon 
are always best for beating eggs or cake mix- 
tures. It is weU iu making cake to beat the 
butter and powdered sugar to a light cream. 
In common cakes, when only a few eggs are 
used, beat them until you can take a spoonful 
up clear from strings. 

To Mix Cakes Containing Butter 

Cream the butter, beating till light ; gradu- 
ally add the sugar, beating till light and 
creamy. Add the yolks of eggs beaten till 
light, then the flavouring. Beat in alternately 
the liquid and flour, the latter mixed with salt 
and baking powder. Lastly, add the beaten 
whites, and fruit, if used. 



To Bake Cakes 

Thin cakes need a hotter oven than loaf 
cakes. Cakes without butter (sponge cakes) 
should have a more moderate, longer baking 
than cakes of sanae size containing butter. 
The process of baking may be divided into 
four periods or quarters of time: in first 
quarter the cake begins to rise ; in second 
quarter it is still rising and begins to colour ; in 
third quarter it browns all over ; in last 
quarter it shrinks from sides of tins. 

To test, insert a clean broom-straw or steel 
skewer into the middle of the cake ; if it comes 
out clean, the cake is done. 

Line loaf-cake pans with buttered paper ; 
fruit cakes need several thicknesses of the 
same. 

Do not use sour mUk, buttermilk, or any of 
the so-called "prepared" or "self-raising" 
flours.

Fruit Short Cakes 

THE old-fashioned fruit short cakes were 
generally made with flour, soda, sour 
milk, and shortening, andwere restricted 
to the strawberry season. We now use Royal 
Baking Powder for lightening them, employ 
all the fruits in their seasons, and thus feast 
ourselves upon the delicate confections almost 
the whole year through. The short cake made 
with Royal Baking Powder and sweet milk is 
incomparably better, surer, and more whole- 
some than the old-fashioned concoction. Too 
much skill was requii'ed in combining soda 
and sour milk. The milk had to be at just the 
right stage of sourness ; not a grain more of 
soda could be used than was sufficient to neu- 
tralize the acid in the milk, or the cake would 
be yellow, with a disagreeable odour and taste ; 
if too little, the cake was heavy. But even the 
young or inexperienced housekeeper will find 
that with Royal Baking Powder to make a per- 
fect short cake is an easy and agreeable task. 
The baking powder only needs to be thoroughly 
sieved with the flour, so that it may evenly 
lighten the cake. Use sweet milk always, and 
never "prepared" or "self-raising" flour. 



For the old-fashioned short cake no eggs are 
needed, the dough being put together in the 
same way as for baking powder biscuit. 

Peach Short Cake.— 1 quart flour, 1 tea- 
spoon salt, 2 heaped teaspoons Royal Baking 
Powder, 2 tablespoons butter, 1 pint milk. 
Sieve the flour, salt, and baking powder to- 
gether. Rub in the butter ; add the milk and 
mix into a smooth dough, just soft enough 
to handle ; divide in haU, and roll out to the 
size of breakfast plates ; lay on a greased bak- 
ing-tin, and bake in hot oven 20 minutes; 
separate the cakes without cutting, as cutting 
makes them heavy. Have 12 large peaches 
peeled and cut in slices; use half of them to 
cover the bottom halves of short cake ; sprinkle 
plentifully with sugar and cream ; lay on the 
top halves with the crust downward ; use the 
remainder of the fruit over them, and sugar 
plentifully. 

Strawberry Short Cake.— Proceed as di- 
rected for peach shortcake, substituting straw- 
berries for peaches. 

Blackberry Short Cake. — Proceed as di- 
rected for peach short cake, substituting black- 
berries for peaches. 

Raspberry Short Cake.— Proceed as di- 
rected for peach short cake, substituting rasp- 
berries for peaches. 

Cherry Short Cake.— - Proceed as directed 
for peach short cake, using pitted sweet or tart 
cherries. 

Apple Short Cake. — Pare, core, and cut 8 
sour apples in eighths. Put into earthen dish 
with 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon lemon 
juice. Ml cup sugar, and a pinch of cinnamon 
or nutmeg. Cover and bake in moderate oven 
till dark red and tender. When cold spread 
between layers of short cake and serve with 
plain or whipped cream or a cold boiled custard. 

Huckleberry Short Cake. — 2 cups sugar, 
% cup butter, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 pint milk, 2 
heaped teaspoons Royal Baking Powder sieved 
with 3 cups flour, 1 quart washed and well- 
drained huckleberries, more flour to make a 
very thick batter. Bake in greased baking-tin, 
break in squares, serve hot with butter. 



Doughnuts and Crullers 

THESE old-fashioned "fried cakes," as 
they were formerly called, require the 
Royal Baking Powder to perfectly make 
them. By its use less shortening is neces- 
sary and the cakes are more tender and more 
digestible. After the baking powder is mixed 
with the flour the other ingredients are added 
and the dough quickly rolled out, cut, and at 
once cooked. The fat should be in a deep pot 
(to obviate any danger of boiling over), and 
should be of sufficient depth to cover the dough 
when first dropped in. It should be smoking 
hot. or the dough will absorb grease and be- 
come heavy. Not more than half a dozen

cut in squares, cut several times in centre 
with jag^ng-iron ; fry brown in deep pot of 
smoking-hot fat. 



Dumplings 



should be dropped in at one time, or some of 
the cakes will be submerged during the cook- 
ing, and when cooked will be greasy and not 
light. One or two pieces of dough should be 
cooked first to ascertain if the dough is of 
proper consistency, and the lard of proper 
temperature. When done the cakes should 
be drained on unglazed paper, then rolled in 
powdered sugar. 

Doughnuts. — 1 ounce butter, 1 cup castor 
sugar, 1%. pints flour, 1% teaspoons Royal Bak- 
ing Powder, 1 egg, IMs cups milk. Beat the 
butter, sugar, and egg together to a cream. 
Sieve the flour and baking powder together, 
add it to the butter, then add the milk. Mix 
into a soft dough ; well flour the board, roU 
the dough V^ inch in thickness, cut out with 
large biscuit-cutter, and fry until light brown 
in plenty of hot lard. Dredge with sugar, and 
serve cold. 

Doughnuts, 2. — Beat well together 2 eggs 
and 2 cups granulated sugar. Add 1 pint milk 
and 1 quart flour in which are mixed and sieved 
3 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 1 teaspoon 
salt, and 1 grated nutmeg. Beat well, then 
add more flour to make a soft dough. Roll 
out V<2 inch thick, cut in rings or small balls, 
and fry brown in a deep pot of smoking-hot 
lard. 

German Doughnuts.— Scald 1 pint milk, 
pour hot over 1 pint flour, and beat till smooth ; 
add Mi teaspoon salt, and let cool. Add beaten 
yolks of 4 eggs, 1 tablespoon melted butter, 1 tea- 
spoon flavouring, Vi cup sugar, beaten whites 
of the eggs, 1 cup flour mixed with 2 teaspoons 
Royal Baking Powder, and more flour to make 
a soft dough. Roll, cut, and fry.

butter, 1 cup sugar, IMj teaspoons Royal Bak- 
ing Powder, % pint milk, 2 eggs. Mi teaspoon 
essence of cinnamon or nutmeg. Sieve the 
flour, sugar, and baking powder together ; rub 
in the lard and butter ; add the beaten eggs, 
flavouring essence, and milk. Mix into a 
smooth dough, just soft enough to handle 
easily. RoU out with the rolling-pin on a 
well-floured board ; cut in strips about Mi inch 
.square, twist in dififerent shapes, and fry light 
brown colour in plenty of hot lard. Dredg-© with 
sugar and serve cold. 

Crullers, 2. — IMi cups sugar, 1 cup milk, 2 
eggs, 2 tablespoons butter, melted, 1 teaspoon 
essence vanilla, 1 teaspoon powdered cinnamon.

Company of New York. See facsimile of label on cover of tMs book. 



APPLE DUMPLINGS, ROYAL.— 1 quart 
ZA flour; thoroughly mix with it 2 tea- 
J. \. spoons Royal Baking Powder and a 
small teaspoon salt ; rub in a piece of butter or 
lard the size of an egg, and then add 1 mediimi 
potato, grated in the flour ; after the butter is 
well mixed, stir in milk and knead to the con- 
sistency of soft biscuit dough ; break off pieces 
of dough large enough to close over 4 quarters 
of an apple (or other fruit, as desired) without 
rolling, and lay in an earthen dish and steam 
until the fruit is tender. 

Apple Dumplings, 2.-8 ounces flour, 4 
ounces fat or butter, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking 
Powder, V4 pint water, 6 apples, 1 heaped table- 
spoon currants (cleaned). Mix the flour, but^- 
ter, baking powder, and water into a light 
paste. Peel and core the apples and fill the 
cavity with the currants. Roll out the paste, 
cut in rounds, place an apple in the centre of 
each, wet the edges of the paste and press 
them up to a point on the top of the apple. 
Place them join downward on a baking-sheet, 
and bake in a moderate oven about 20 minutes. 
When nearly done brush over with cold water, 
and dredge well with fine sugar. Serve either 
hot or cold. 

Berry Dumplings. — Use berries of any kind, 
carefuUy picked, hulled, or prepared, and make 
as for apple dumplings, putting 1 or 2 table- 
spoons berries into each dumpling. 

Oxford Dumplings. — 4 ounces bread crumbs, 
4 ounces flour, 4 ounces finely chopped suet, 
4 ounces currants (cleaned and picked), the 
grated rind of Mi a lemon, a good pinch of salt, 
a good pinch of nutmeg, 2 eggs, and [a little 
milk. Mix all the dry ingredients together, 
add the eggs and as much milk as is required 
to make the mixture moist enough to drop 
easily from the spoon. Divide in 6 equal por- 
tions, tie in small pudding-cloths (previously 
dipped into boiling water and weU floured) or 
in the corners of two large cloths. Put into 
boiling water, and boil gently 1 hour. Serve 
with sweet sauce. 

Dumplings for Stew or Fricassee.— Re- 
ceipts for making dumplings for a stew or fric- 
assee frequently call for too much shortening. 
This is a mistake, for light, easily digested 
dumplings form a more suitable accompaniment 
to a rich stew than those made of suet, which, 
in consequence of the large proportion of fat 
contained in them, severely tax the digestive 
system. Dumplings of this class are made 
from ordinary bread dough, and owe the light- 
ness which is their chief recommendation en- 
tirely to the gas produced by the action of 
yeast. Yet very much better results may 
be obtained by substituting Royal Baking 
Powder for yeast; and nothing more is 
needed to make light, wholesome dump- 
lings of this description than flour, salt. Royal

Baking Powder, and sweet milk. Their extreme 
lightness demands a certain amount of care in 
cooking them. The liquor must be quite boil- 
ing when they are added, and kept at that 
temperature while they are cooking ; the boil- 
ing liquor should provide space for the dump- 
lings to float side by side on the surface, for if 
submerged they lose some of their lightness ; 
heaviness is also sometimes caused when — by 
raising the lid of the boiling-pot — a current of 
cold air exerts its pressure on their extreme 
lightness and causes them to partially collapse. 

Dumplings for Soup. — 1 cup flour, Vi tea- 
spoon salt, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, 
sieved together. Add M? cup finely chopped 
suet and enough milk to make stifl' dough. 
Form in dumplings size of marbles, drop into 
soup, cover, and boil 10 minutes. 

Egg Dumplings for Soup. — Beat 2 eggs, 
add V4 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons milk. Sieve 
1 cup flour with 1 level teaspoon Royal Baking 
Powder, add egg mixture and more flour if 
necessary to make thick batter. Drop by half- 
teaspooniuls in boiling soup ; cover, cook 10 
minutes. 

Dumplings for Stews. — Mix and sieve 1 
pint flour, 2iteaspoons Royal Baking Powder, Vi 
teaspoon salt. Mix to soft dough with milk. 
Turn on boara, roU out 1 inch thick, cut in 
small circles. RoU each in flour, drop on top 
simmering stew. Cover, cook 10 or 15 minutes 
without opening pot. 

Suet Dumplings. — 1 cup bread crumbs, 2 
tablespoons finely chopped beef suet, whites and 
yolks of 2 eggs, beaten separately, % teaspoon 
salt, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking Powder sieved 
with 1 cup flour, sufficient milk to mix to stiff 
paste. Flour hands and make in balls. Wring 
small cloths in hot water, dust with flour, lay 
ball in each, and tie, leaving room to swell. 
Cook in rapidly boiling water 45 minutes, and 
serve with liquid sauce. (See Sauces.)

them, and put into a stewpan with the sugar 
and butter; peel the lemon thinly, add the 
rind to the apples, cover the stewpan, and cook 
slowly until the apples are tender, then rub 
the apple pur^e through a hair sieve. Roll 
out the paste, stamp out some small rounds 
about the width of the pie-dish edge. Line the 
edge of the pie-dish with a narrow strip of 
paste, brush over with a little white of egg, 
and arrange the rounds of paste on same as 
neatly as possible. Stir the yolks of eggs into 
the apple pur^e, add half the lemon juice. 
Pour this into the pie-dish, and bake for about 
15 minutes. Whisk the whites of 2 eggs to a 
very stiff froth. Spread this roughly on top 
of the apple mixture in the pie-dish, decorate 
with halves of glac6 chen-ies, dredge with 
castor sugar, and bake in a slack oven for 
another 15 minutes, or until the top acquires a 
light brown colour.

little sugar and a few sultanas, repeat until 
the basin is nearly fuU. Beat the eggs, add 
to them the sugar and mUk, pour over the 
bread, and put the pudding aside for at least 1 
hour. Have ready a saucepan half full of boU- 
ing water, put in the pudding, cover the top 
with a greased paper, and steam gently for 
about 1 hour. 

Bread and Butter Pudding (Baked). — 

This is made in the same manner as the above, 
a pie-dish being used instead of a basin. The 
dish must be only half filled with bread and

College Pudding. — % pound bread crumbs, 
% pound finely chopped suet, V4 poiand cur- 
rants, washed and picked, V4 pound sultanas, 
<!leaned and picked, 2 ounces mixed peel, finely 
shredded, V4 pound moist sugar, 2 eggs, a good

Custards require to be made carefully, and 
need not, unless occasion demands it, be made 
expensively. The plain boiled custard, usually 
served in tarts or puddings, may be cheaply 
prepared. 

Custards may ha\ d the delicate flavoui's of 
lemon, orange, rose, vanilla, nutmeg, etc., com- 
municated to them by using flavouring essences. 
A few drops of rose will answer where a tea- 
spoon or two of vaniUa would be required. By 
their use you avoid the necessity of straining 
the custard ; flavourings should be added to 
custards after they are made, to avoid driving 
off the fine aroma by the heat. 

Plain Boiled Custard.— 1 quart milk, 8 eggs, 
peel of 1 large lemon, V4 pound powdered sugar.

flavouring to taste ; pour into the mould, cover 
with a piece of gi-eased paper, and steam for 
about 30 minutes or until firm, then turn care- 
fully on a hot dish. No sauce is required, for

THE ROYAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK 



Pies and Tarts 

THE richest pastry for pies is called puff 
paste, and much skiU and practice are 
required to make it flaky, tender, and 
Tery light. First-class puff paste wUl rise in 
baking to double its thickness, and be in light, 
flaky layers and without greasiness. The 
novice must learn to handle it as lightly and 
little as possible in rolling and turning. 

Pastry flour should always be used for pie 
crust. It is whiter than bread flour and when 
rubbed between the fingers it feels very smooth 
and soft, like corn-flour. Carefully sieve before 
using. 

Where it is desired to have a plainer pastry, 
or one less troublesome to make and more eco- 
nomical, the use of a small quantity of Royal 
Baking Powder will give a light crust. As in 
■other cases, the baking powder must be mixed 
and sieved with the flour before the shortening 
is added. Sweet home-made lard may be used 
in place of butter, and will give a light paste ; 
but butter is better and costs only a trifle 
more. Never use sour milk or so-called " pre- 
pared" or "self-raising" flours. 

Make pastry with clean, cold hands. Dip 
the hands in cold water (after washing them 
in hot water) before beginning. Attend to the 
oven ; if it is too cold it will make the crust 
heavy, if too hot the crust will be burned. Try 
it by baking a tiny piece of crust in it first. 
Make a little hole in the top crust of meat pies 
to let out gas. 

Light Pie Paste, i. — Paste made in the fol- 
lowing manner will be found to make light and 
good pastry ; although not quite so rich as puff 
paste, it will be found more serviceable for 
rissoles, tarts, pies, and many other purposes. 
Sieve % pound flour into a basin and rub in 
with the finger-tips 6 ounces of best butter. 
Work it thus until it resembles whole-meal 
flour ; add to the flour a pinch of salt and a 
heaped-up teaspoon Royal Baking Powder. 
Make a well in the centre of the mixture and 
moisten with sufficient water to make it into 
a fairly stiff but smooth paste. The water 
must be added carefully, for the paste to be 
successful must be neither too moist nor too 
stiff. Flour the paste-board and roUing-pin. 
RoU the paste out, fold it neatly, and set aside 
in a cool place till wanted. 

French Puff Paste, 2.— % pound flour, % 
pound butter, a pinch salt cold water, 1 tea- 
spoon lemon juice, 1 heaped-up teaspoon Royal 
Baking Powder. Mix the baking powder with 
the flour, sieve on a board, make a well in the 
centre, mix it into a paste with salt, lemon 
juice, and water. Roll out in an oblong strip. 
Put the butter into a cloth, knead a little so as 
to squeeze out the moisture, and form it in a 
flat cake. Place the butter in the centre of 
the paste and fold over so as to completely en- 
close it. Roll out, fold in three, and roU out in 
an oblong shape again; continue this 4 or 5 



times, setting the paste aside in a cool place 
for 20 minutes after each turn. Before using 
it should be allowed to stand for at least Mt 
hour. 

Rich Paste for Pies, 3. — 8 ounces flour, & 
ounces butter, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking Pow- 
der, 1 teaspoon castor sugar, Va pint cold water. 
Rub the butter lightly into the flour, add sugar 
and baking powder, and cold water to form a 
very stiff paste. Use for fruit tarts, etc. 

Suet Paste, 4. — 8 ounces flour, 4 ounces 
finely chopped suet, 1 level teaspoon Royal 
Baking Powder, V4 pint cold water (about). 
Mix the dry ingredients, add sufiicient water 
to make a stiff paste. Use for fruit or meat 
puddings, either steamed or boiled. 

Flaky Paste, 5.-8 ounces flour, 2 ounces 
lard, 4 ounces butter, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking 
Powder, V4 pint cold water (about). Mix the 
baking powder with the flour, rub in the lard, 
add as much water as is required to form a 
fairly stiff" paste. RoU out thinly, divide the 
butter in three equal portions, and place one 
portion on the paste in small pieces. Fold the 
paste exactly in three, and roll out ; repeat un- 
til the other portions of butter are used. Put 
the paste aside in a cool place for 1 hour, then 
use as required. Bake in a hot oven. 

Apple Pie. — 3 tart apples, "^ cup sugar, ^^ 
lemon rind grated, paste, 3. Peel, core, and 
slice apples very thin; line pie-plate with 
paste; put in apples, sugar, and little water; 
wet the edges, cover with paste rolled out

oven 20 minutes. 

Cocoanut Pie. — Proceed as for custard pie, 
plain, adding IMi cups grated cocoanut, and 
leaving out V2 pint milk. 

Custard Pie (Plain).— Paste, 5. Line well- 
greased pie-plate with paste, and fill with cus- 
tard made as directed in baked custard. 

Custard Pie (Peach). — Proceed as for cus- 
tard pie, plain, laying in bottom of pie some 
cooked, fresh, or canned peaches, then adding 
the custard. 

Custard Pie (Apple). — Proceed as for cus- 
tard pie (peach), substituting thick stewed 
apples. 

Cherry Pie. — Paste, 3 ; 3 cups of cherries,

rants, stewed 10 minutes with 1 cup sugar, and 
strained. Line pie-plate with paste; put in 
currants ; moisten the edges, lay 3 narrow bars 
across ; fasten at edge, then 3 more across, 
forming diamond-shaped spaces. Lay rim of 
same paste; brush with egg; bake in quick 



oven until paste is cooked.

soft; rub through a sieve; have them juicy. 
Beat 2 eggs, saving white of 1 ; 1 ounce butter, 
1 ounce sugar to every pie; season to taste. 
Quantity of sugar must be governed somewhat 
by the acidity of the apples. Bake with a 
bottom crast; whUe they are baking make a 
meringue mixture (see Apple Amber) of the 
white of 1 egg ; when pies are done spread the 
meringue mixture evenly over the top ; set 
again iu the oven and brown slightly.

pie : Beat 1 egg to a stiff frotV, then add pul- 
verized sugar and grated chocolate with V2 tea- 
spoon essence vanilla; spread this on the top 
of the pie and let it harden for a moment in the 
oven. Or it may be prepared in still another 
way. Put the chocolate in a basin on the back 
of the stove and let it dissolve (do not put a 
drop of water with it) ; when dissolved beat 1 
egg and some sugar in with it ; in the latter 
case it will be a regular chocolate brown in

Jellies and Jams 

How TO MAKE JELLIES.— Put the 
fruit in stone jar placed in boiler of hot 
water. When fruit is sufficiently soft- 
ened, strain through jelly-bag, place juice in 
preserving-kettle, and allow 1 pound of sugar to 
1 pint of juice. While heating juice place sugar 
in dish in oven ; allow juice to boil 20 minutes, 
then add heated sugar. Let all come to a boU 
and remove from fire. Having glasses scalded, 
pour in brimming full, and allow them to stand 
for at least a day, or till jelly is thoroughly set ; 
cover with tissue-paper saturated with brandy, 
and over all paste thick white or brown paper. 

Apple Jelly. — Take apples, wipe and slice 
them ; use seeds, skins, and all ; cook soft in

white sugar, and grated rind and juice of 2 lem- 
ons. Let stand on stove until hot, but do not 
boil. Then strain into moulds. 

Plum Jelly. — Take as many plums as you 
desire, pour sufficient boiling water over to 
cover them. Pour off water immediately, 
draining them. Put plums in preserving-kettle 
with boiling water enough to cover again ; then 
boil till they begin to open and some juice is 
extracted. Then pour off liquid, strain it, add 
to each pound of juice 1 pound white sugar, 
return to kettle ; boil it from 20 minutes to ^ 
hour, as it may require, and you will have most 
delicious jelly. The plums may be used for 
pies or sauce. 

Quince Jelly. — Slice quinces without either 
paring or coring. Put them into preserving- 
kettle ; just cover with water ; put over fire, 
boil until soft. Remove from stove, strain off 
liquor. To each gallon allow 4 pounds white 
sugar; boil very fast until it becomes a stiff 
jelly. 

Lemon Jelly. — 1% ounces French gelatine 
soaked in ^ pint cold water 1 hour ; add 1 pint 
boiling water, 1% cups sugar, and essence of 



lemon to taste. Stand on stove until boiHng. 
Strain into mould, set in cool place. 

Strawberry or Raspberry Jelly.— Get fine- 
coloured, fresh, ripe fruit ; put over fire at suffi- 
cient distance for juice to flow slowly ; do not 
allow it to run after it is perfectly clear, proba- 
bly 20 minutes; then run through jelly-bag 
without pressing. If juice is at all turbid strain 
again through muslin into pan ; simmer it V4 
hour ; then add 1 pound white sugar to each 
pint juice and boil 10 minutes longer. 

Wine Jelly. — 2% ounces French gelatine

wine, and strain again through flannel bag with- 
out squeezing, and leave in mould until solid. 

Black or Red Currant Jam.— Time, ^4 to 1 

hour. To each pound currants allow % pound 
sugar. Gather currants on fine day ; pick from 
stems. Put them into preserving-pan with 
sugar broken in small pieces. Bring gradually 
to boil, then let simmer, removing scum as it 
rises, stirring jam constantly. When done, 
piit into pots with brandy paper over them, and 
tie down closely. 

Gooseberry Jam. — Time, IV4 hours. \

apple. Put pound to pound of pineapple and 
sugar. BoU it in preserving-kettle 30 or 40 
minutes. 



Preserved Fruits 

DIRECTIONS FOR SUGAR PRE- 
SERVES.— Preserves should be kept 
carefully from air, in very dry place ; 
if they stand in a damp place they will become 
mouldy. They should be looked at 2 or 3 times 
in first 2 months, and gently boiled again if not 
likely to keep. It is supposed by some that 
cheap sugar will do for preserves. This is a 
mistake ; the very best sugar should be used. 
If cheap sugar is used, it should be cleansed 
and all scum taken off. 

Preserves require from % to 1 pound of 
white sugar to each pound of fruit, and Mi cup 
water to each pound of sugar. The fruit should 
be simmered in the syrup until tender, a little 
at a time ; skimmed out into the jars ; when 
aU are done the syrup should be brought to 
boiling point, jars filled and sealed. Hard 
fruits like quinces should be first steamed or 
cooked in boiling water till tender.

THE ROYAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK 



Citron Preserves. — Prepare rind in any 
form desired ; boil very hard 30 or 40 minutes 
in water ; take from water and put into clear 
cold water ; allow them to stand overnight ; in 
morning change water and put them to boU ; 
let cook until they have entirely changed colour 
and are quite soft ; then make syrup, allowing 
IV2 pounds white sugar to 1 pound friut ; then 
add fruit, which needs but little more cooking. 
Mace, ginger, or lemon flavours nicely. 

Peach Preserves. — Take ripe but not soft 
peaches. Pour boiling water over them to 
take off skins, which will pull off easily. Weigh 
equal quantities fruit and sugar ; put them to- 
gether in earthen pan overnight. In morning 
pour off syrup, boU few minutes ; take off 
scum. Put pan back on fire ; when syrup boils 
up, put in peaches. Boil them slowly % hour ; 
take out and put in jars. Boil syrup 15 min- 
utes more, and pour over them. 

To Preserve Strawberries. — To 1 pound 
strawberries, after they have been picked over, 
add 1 pound sugar ; put them into preserving- 
pan, over slow fire, until sugar is dissolved, 
then boU them precisely 25 minutes fast as 
possible]; have jar ready and put fruit into it 
boiling hot ; jar shoiild be heated before hot 
fruit is poured into it, otherwise it will break. 
■Cover and seal jars immediately ; set in a cool 
place. 

Quince and Apple Preserves. — Take an 
equal amount of sweet apples and qmnces ; 
weigh them, then take by weight an equal 
amount of sugar ; pare, quarter, and core the 
fruit. When quince is boiled tender, take it 
out ; boil apples in quince water, put them into 
syrup, let them boil till they look red and 
clear — IV2 hours is not too long. Do not boil 
quinces in syrup, but put layers of the apple, 
when done, into jars with quince, previously 
cooked tender in water, and pour syrup over 
them. 

Preserved Quinces. — Pare, quarter, and 
core them, saving skins and cores. Put quinces 
over fire with just water enough to cover them, 
and simmer till soft, but do not let them cook 
till they break. Take out fruit and spread 011 
dishes to cool ; add parings and cores to water 
in which quinces were boiled ; stew an hour ; 
then strain through jelly-bag ; to each pint of 
this liquor allow 1 pound of sugar. BoU and 
skim this, put in fruit, and boil 15 minutes. 
Take all off the fire, and let stand in deep dish 
24 hours. Then drain off syrup, let it boil, put 
in quinces, and boil 15 minutes. Take out fruit 
again, spread on dishes ; boU syrup down nearly 
to a jelly. Put fruit into jars % full, and cover 
with the syrup. The quinces will be a fine 
deep red color. 

Ripe Tomato Preserves.— 7 pounds round 
yellow tomatoes, peeled, 7 pounds sugar, juice 
3 lemons ; let stand together overnight. Drain 
off syrup and boil it, skim weU, then put in the 
tomatoes and boil gently 20 minutes. Take 
out fruit with skimmer, spread on dishes. 
Boil syrup down till it thickens, adding, just 
before you take it off fire, juice of the lemons. 
Put fruit into jars and fill up with hot syrup. 
When cold, seal up. 

To Preserve Currants.— To 10 pounds 

currants 7 pounds sugar; take stems from 7 



pounds currants, press the juice from other 3 
pounds. When sugar is made into hot syrup, 
put in currants ; boil until thick and rich. 



¥ 



Canned Fruits 

THE important points to be observed in 
canning are : use only sound, ripe fruit; 
have hot syrup and air-tight jars ; fill 
jars to overflowing and seal immediately. Jars 
should be scalded and tested before using. 
Patent canners greatly simplify the work. 

Pick over the fruit, stem, pare, cut, wash, 
etc., and pack in jars. Make syrup by adding 
V2 pint boiling water to 1 pound white sugar. 
When clear, bring to boiling point and care- 
fully fill the jars. Stand in canner or on board 
in wash-boiler containing water up to shoulders 
of jars. Cover and cook according to direc- 
tions or until tender. Take from canuer or 
boiler, add more syrup till overflowing, cover 
and seal immediately.

Soups, Etc. 



STOCK FOR SOUP AND SAUCES.— 3 
pounds of shin of beef, 3 quarts of water, 
1 onion, 1 carrot, V2 turnip, 1 stalk of 
celery, herbs, 3 cloves, salt, and peppercorns. 
Put the beef and the water on the fire, and 
simmer slowly for several hours. Skim and 
strain; when cold, take off the fat, then add 
the vegetables, previously prepared, etc., sea- 
soning; boU gently for about 1 houi"; strain 
through a cloth. This is now ready for soup 
or stock for sauces. Consomm^ is clarified 
stock, enriched and strengthened with meat 
and fresh vegetable flavour. Almost every 
kind of clear soup, known as consomm^ in the 
culinary language, is prepared in this manner. 
The different new names applied to consommes 
generally refer to the garnishing which is added 
to them. Thus a spring soup, or consomm^ k 
la printaniere, is made with clear soup and a 
garnishing of spring vegetables (mixed), cut 
into neat shapes and boiledjtherein untU tender.

utes. Season to taste with salt and a pinch of 
castor sugar. Strain through a cloth. It is 
then ready for use.

Fish and Shell Fish 

DIRECTIONS FOR PREPARING.— CTean 
fish carefully, slit it low enough to be 
able to clean thoroughly, but do not 
make too large a cut so as to spoil look of fish ; 
wash in cold water. Great care must be taken 
not to break gall, for it would make fish bitter. 
Use good dripping or lard for frying. 

To Broil Fish. — Clean, wash, and wipe dry. 
Split so that when laid flat the backbone will 
be in the middle, or take the backbone out. 
Sprinkle with salt and lay, inside down, upon 
a buttered gridiron over a clear fire until it is 
nicely coloured, then turn. When done, put 
upon a hot dish, butter plentifully, and pepper. "*> 
Put a hot cover over it and send to table. 

Boiled Codfish.— About4poundsvery fresh 
codfish (middle cut). Mi wine-glass French wine 
vinegar, 1 onion, 2 cloves, peppercorns, 1 smaU 
handful salt. Wipe codfish with a cloth, place 
in a fish-kettle, cover barely with warm water, 
season with a small handful salt, add a medium- 
sized sliced onion, thecloves, a few peppercorns, 
and vinegar. Let it come to a boil qmckly, and 
allow it to simmer very gently for about 5 
minutes, when the fish wiU be sufficiently 
cooked. Drain it well, dish up on a folded 
napkin, serve on a hot dish with oyster sauce. 



THE ROYAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK

Fried Cod. — Procure about 2 pounds of fresh 
cod (middle cut), cut it in slices about % inch 
thick, wipe the slices, dip them in flour, brush 
over with beaten egg, and crumb with fresh 
bread crumbs. Fry in deep fat (smoking hot) 
a golden colour, drain, and dish up. Garnish 
with parsley and serve with a boat of anchovy 
sauce. 

Creamed Fish. — Steam 2 pounds codfish, 
break in flakes, removing bones and skin. 
Make 1 pint white sauce. (See Meat and Pish 
Sauces.) Grease a baking-dish, fill with alter- 
nate layers of fish and sauce, seasoning with 
salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and lemon juice 
or a few drops of vinegar. Mix together 1 cup 
dry bread crumbs and 3 tablespoons melted 
butter; spread over top and brown in quick 
oven. 

This may be varied by using tomato, becha- 
mel, curry, or any other sauce, or by adding 
grated cheese or sliced hard-boiled eggs to the 
white sauce, by baking in shells or patty-paus 
in place of the deep dish, or by covering with 
mashed potato instead of crumbs. 

Broiled Halibut.— Slices of halibut, salt, 
pepper, butter. Cut the slices of fish about an 
inch thick, season with pepper and salt, and lay 
them in melted butter Vij hour, allowing 3 table- 
spoons of butter to a pound of fish ; then roU 
them in flour, and broil about 15 minutes. Serve 
very hot. 

Fish Salad. — Skin, bone, and shred some 
cold fish (almost any kind of white fish or sal- 
mon will do), put this into a large mixing-bowl, 
and add to it V4 its quantity of lettuce washed 
and shredded, also Vi of white cleaned celery 
(if in season) ; cut the celery in shreds or 
strips. Mix all carefully, adding salt and pep- 
per to taste. Arrange neatly in a salad-bowl, 
and pour over some mayonnaise dressing. Gai'- 
nish tastefully with hard-boiled egg cut in 
sUces, and a little small cress or cresses. When 
celery is not obtainable, use shredded endive 
or sliced tomatoes. 

Oyster Fritters. — 12 plump oysters, 2 
ounces flour, 1 egg, frying fat, % lemon, 6 thin 
slices of streaky bacon, a pinch of salt, % 
ounce butter, parsley. Beard the oysters, and 
sprinkle over with lemon juice. Flatten the 
bacon with a cutlet-bat, and cut each slice in 
two crosswise. Roll up each oyster with a 
hall slice of bacon and trim the edges. Pre- 
pare a batter in the following manner : Sieve 
the flour into a basin, add a pinch of salt, stir 
in the yolk of egg, and moisten with sufficient 
tepid water (about 1 tablespoon) and the but- 
ter (oiled) to form a smooth paste; beat up 
well with a wooden spoon, and allow it to stand 
for a time. Whisk the white of egg to a stiff 
froth and add it to the batter ; dip each oyster 
and bacon into the batter, cover completely 
with batter, and drop one by one into boiling 
fat or clarified butter. Fry a golden colour, 
drain, and dish up. Fry some washed and 
picked parsley, and garnish the dish with it. 

Grilled Red Mullets, with Parsley But- 
ter. — Procure 3 or 4 fresh red mullets, wipe 
thim with a damp cloth, and make 3 or 4 in- 
cisions across each fish with a sharp knife. 
Put the fish on a dish, pour over 3 or 4 table- 
spoons salad oO. season with salt and pepper, 
and let them stand thus for about 1 hour. | 



Meanwhile prepare some parsley butter as fol- 
lows: Mis 1 ounce fresh butter with 1 tea- 
spoon chopped parsley, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 
a pinch of salt and pepper. Spread on a plate, 
put on the ice, and shape in pats when quite 
firm. See that the gridiron is perfectly clean, 
grease it, place on it the red mullets, and cook 
them slowly over or in front of a bright fire. 
Turn frequently. When done take up the fish. 
Put some maitre d'hotel butter on a dish, 
place the mullets upon this, spread a little 
more butter on top of each fish, garnish with 
fresh parsley, and serve hot. 

Fried Scallops.— 18 scallops, Mi ounce but- 
ter, 1 gill milk, salt, pepper, and cayenne, 1 egg, 
2 ounces flour, frying fat, parsley. Drain the 
scallops on a cloth. Sieve the flour into a basin 
and add a pinch of salt. Melt the butter, break 
up the egg, and stir both in ; then add the milk, 
and work until quite smooth. If the batter be 
too thick add a little more melted butter or milk. 
Let it stand for an hour, then stir in a dessert- 
spoon chopped parsley. Season the scallops 
with a little salt, a good pinch of white pepper, 
and a small pinch of cayenne. Dip them into 
the batter, drop into hot fat one by one, fry a 
golden brown, di-ain on a cloth, pUe up on a hot 
dish, garnish with fried parsley, and serve with 
lobster or^tomato sauce. 

Baked Salmon a Tltalienne. — About 2 
pounds salmon (middle cut), 1 teaspoon chopped 
parsley, 1 small glass claret, 2 small shallots, 
peeled and chopped, salt, pepper, and grated 
nutmeg, G^noise or tomato sauce. Cut the fish 
in 2 or 3 even-sized slices, place them on a 
well-buttered baking-tin or saut^-pan, season 
with salt, pepper, and a little grated nutmeg, 
sprinkle over the chopped shallots and parsley, 
and place the remainder of butter on top of the 
fish, moisten with the wine, and bake in the 
oven for about 15 minutes, basting frequently. 
When done dish up, and pour some G^noise or 
tomato sauce over the slices of salmon. The 
essence left in the pan in which the fish was 
baked must be utilized for flavouring the sauce 

Sole au Gratin. — In France there is but one 
way of doing sole au gratin, i. e. , the right way ; 
but in England there are several ways. To my 
mind there is no better method than the French, 
and a sole cooked " au gratin " after the French 
formula is an exceedingly tasty dish, and once 
introduced no one could possibly wish to try 
any other gratin style. Here is the receipt : 
Take a large sole, skin both sides, i. e., remove 
the white and the black skin, cut off the head 
and fins. Make several incisions with a knife, 
season one side of the fish, place it cut side 
upward on a well-buttered silver-plated gratin- 
dish. Season with pepper and salt, add M> 
smaU glass of white wine, a little mushroom 
liquor, and some chopped parsley. Place a row 
of sliced preserved mushrooms down the centre 
of the fish, and cover with a rich Italian sauce. 
Sprinkle with brown-bread crumbs, put a few 
tiny bits of butter here and there on top of the 
fish, and bake in a moderate oven from 20 to 30 
minutes, according to the size of the sole. Place 
the dish as it leaves the oven on another (larger) 
dish, and send to table. 

Fried Fillet of Whiting. — 3 medium-sized 
skinned whitings, 1 dessert-spoon chopped pars- 
ley, pepper and salt, frying batter, Hollandaise

THE ROYAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK 



sauce, 2 tablespoons sweet oil, 1 tablespoon 
vinegar (French), parsley for garnish, fat for 
frying. Remove the fillets, flatten them slightly, 
fold them in two, and put in a deep dish ; sea- 
son with pepper and salt, sprinkle over the oil, 
vinegar, and chopped parsley ; let them soak 
for 1 or 2 hours. Take out, drain, dip in frying 
batter (previously prepared), fry in hot clari- 
fied butter or fat a golden colour, drain on a 
cloth or paper, dish up on a folded napkin ; 
garnish with fried parsley, and serve with 
Hollandaise sauce. (For frying batter see fore- 
going receipt for fried scallops.) 

Broiled Salt Mackerel. — Freshen by soak- 
ing it overnight in water, taking care that the 
skin lies uppermost. In the morning dry it 
without breaking, cut off the head and tip of 
the tail, place it between the bars of a buttered 
fish-gridiron, and broil to a light brown ; lay 
it on a hot dish, and dress with a little butter, 
pepper, and lemon juice, vinegar, or chopped 
pickle. 



Meats 

Broiling or Grilling 

THE rules for roasting meat apply also to 
broiling, except that instead of cooking 
it in the oven it is to be quickly browned, 
first on one side and then on the other, over a 
hot fire. Meat an inch thick will take from 8 
to 10 minutes. It should be seasoned after it 
is cooked. 

Frying 
There are two distinct methods of frying: 
One with a very little fat in the pan, to practise 
which successfully the pan and the fat must 
be hot before the article to be fried is put into 
it. For instance, in frying chops, if the pan is 
hot, and only fat enough is used to keep the 
chops from sticking to it, the heat being main- 
tained so that the chops cook quickly, they 
will be nearly as nice as if they were broiled. 
Frying by the other method consists in entirely 
immersing the article to be cooked in sufficient 
smoking-hot fat to cover it, and keeping the 
fat at that degree of heat until the food is 
brown. It should then be taken up with a 
skimmer and laid upon paper for a moment to 
free it from grease. 

Boiling and Stewing 

Fresh meat for boiling should be put into 
boiling water and simmered very gently about 
20 minutes for each pound. A little salt, spice, 
or vegetables may be cooked in the water with 
the meat for seasoning. A little vinegar put 
in the water with tough meat makes it tender. 
The broth of boiled meat should always be 
saved to use in soups, stews, and gravies. 
Stewing and simmering meats mean to place 
them near enough to the fire to keep the water 
on them bubbling moderately, constantly, and 
slowly. Salt meats may be put over the fire 
in cold or warm water. Salted and smoked 



meats require about 30 minutes' very slow 
boiling, from the time the water boils, to each 
pound. Vegetables and herbs may be boiled 
with them to flavour. When they are cooked 
the vessel containing them should be set where 
they will keep hot without boiling until re- 
quired, if they are to be served hot ; if they 
are to be served cold, they should be allowed 
to cool in the pot liquor in which they were 
boiled. Very salt meats, or those much dried 
in smoking, should be well soaked in cold 
water before boiling. 

Roasting 

Wipe meat with damp cloth. Trim and tie 
in shape if necessary. In the bottom of pan 
put some pieces of fat from meat. Arrange 
meat on rack in pan. Have oven very hot at 
first ; when meat has cooked long enough to 
harden the surface albumen reduce the heat. 
Baste every 10 or 15 minutes. If there is dan- 
ger of fat in pan being scorched add a few 
spoons of boiling water. Allow from 10 to 20 
miniites per pound of meat, according as it is 
desired rare or well done. When done remove 
to hot platter. Thicken gravy in pan with 
browned flour, adding more water as necessary 
and add seasoning. 

Braised Beef.— Wipe and trim 6 pounds 
round or rump of beef without bone. Brown 
on all sides in very hot frying-pan over hot 
fire. In braising-pan or iron kettle put layers 
of sliced onions, turnips, and carrots; add 
bunch sweet herbs, 1 teaspoon salt, % teaspoon 
pepper ; on this lay meat. Add 1 pint boiling 
water (or water and stewed tomatoes). Cover 
closely and cook 4 hours in moderate oven. 
If water evaporates rapidly add more. Trans- 
fer meat to hot platter. Strain, thicken, and 
season gravy. The vegetables may be served 
separately if desired. 

Broiled Steak. — Trim andwipe steak, which 
should be at least 1 inch thick. Rub broiler 
with fat, arrange steak with thickest part in 
centre of broiler. Have fire clear and very hot, 
but without blaze. Hold steak close to fire. 
Turn frequently to equalize the cooking. 
When % done season with salt and pepper. 
Steak 1 inch thick will broil in 6 or 7 minutes. 

Panned Steak or Chops. — Trim and wipe 
steak. Heat frying-pan until it smokes all over. 
Rub bottom with fat. Lay in steak and turn 
every 10 seconds. Keep pan very hot. Season 
when Mi done. 

Miitton and pork chops, ham and bacon, may 
be panned in same way. 

If hot platter for steak is rubbed with a cut 
onion it will give a delightful flavour to the 
meat. 

Broiled Ham and Poached Eggs.— Cut 
slices of boiled ham of equal size ; broil on a 
gridiron over a clear fire ; lay on a hot dish. 
Lay on each a poached egg, neatly trimmed, 
and serve. 

Cornish Cutlets. — About % pound cold 
meat, 1 tablespoon ketchup, 2 eggs, chopped 
lemon rind, salt and pepper, 1 pound potatoes, 
1 teaspoon chopped parsley, bread crumbs, 

Be sure to demand the genuine ROYAL Baking Powder, made by the Royal Baking Powder 
Company of New York. See facsimile of label on cover of this book.

fat for frying. Cut the meat in slices IV4 
inches thick, trim them in heart shapes ; put 
the slices on a dish, and sprinkle with salt, 
pepper, and parsley ; pour over the ketchup. 
Wash, peel, and boil the potatoes, dry them 
and rub through a sieve, beat up 1 egg and 
mix with the mash ; season with pepper and 
salt, and add the lemon juice or a little grated 
nutmeg. Cover each slice of meat well with 
mashed potatoes, shape and smooth with a 
knife. Beat up the other egg, dip each cutlet 
in the egg, and crumb well ; when set, egg and 
crumb again. Fry the cutlets in hot fat a 
golden colour, drain on a cloth, dish tip, and 
garnish with crisp parsley. 

To Boil a Ham. — A blade of mace, a few 
cloves, a sprig of thyme, and 2 bay-leaves. 
Well soak ham in large quantity of water for 
24 hours, then trim and scrape very clean ; put 
into large stewpan, with more than suJiicient 
water to cover it ; put in mace, cloves, thyme, 
and bay-leaves. Boil 4 or 5 hours, according 
to weight ; when done, let it become cold in 
liquor in which it was boiled. Then remove 
rind carefully, without injuring the fat ; press 
cloth over it to absorb as much of the grease 
as possible. It is always improved by setting 
into the oven for nearly an hour, till much of 
the fat dries out, and it also makes it more 
tender. Shake some bread raspings over the 
fat. Serve cold, garnished with parsley. 

Brown Kidney Stew. — From a beef kidney 
cut oflf the outside meat in bits, rejecting the 
cores. Cover with cold water ; laeat slowly till 
steaming, drain, add cold water, and heat a 
second time. To the drained kidneys add 1 
cup brown sauce (see Sauces), season very 
highly with Worcestershire and ketchup, and 
stand over hot water for 10 minutes. 

Irish Stew. — 3 pounds neck of mutton, 1 
large onion, H<j pints stock, 4 pounds potatoes, 
12 button onions, salt and pepper. Cut the 
neck into convenient pieces, trim off some of 
the fat. Wash, peel, and slice the potatoes. 
Peel and slice the onion. Peel the button 
onions and blanch. Put a layer of potatoes at 
the bottom of a stewpan, put a layer of meat 
on that, season with pepper and salt, strew 
over a few slices of onion ; proceed thus until 
the meat is used up. Add the small onions, 
when blanched, whole among the layers. 
Cover the top with a layer of potatoes, add 
the stock, place on fire, and simmer for about 
2 hours. This stew should not be skimmed, as 
the fat will be absorbed by the potatoes ; any 
scum which rises to the top before it com- 
mences to simmer should of course be removed. 
When done dish up neatly on a hot dish, 
sprinkle over a little chopped parsley, and 
serve. The stew, if properly cooked, should 
not look watery. A teaspoon of mushrooms or 
walnut ketchup may be added where this sea- 
soning is liked. 

Cold Meat Kedgeree. — 6 oimces cold meat 
(any kind will do), 2 hard-boiled eggs, 2 slices 
finely chopped onion, 4 ounces rice, 1 ounce 
butter, parsley, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Re- 
move the skin, gristle, and superfluous fat 
from the meat, and chop it not too finely. 
Boil the rice in the usual manner, so that when 
tender each grain will separate and is intact ; 
drain the rice when done. Melt the butter in 
a stewpan, add the onion, and fry a golden 



colour, then add the meat and fry for a few 
minutes ; stir in the rice, season to taste with 
salt, pepper, and a grate of nutmeg. Shell the 
eggs, chop the whites, and mix with the above. 
Heat up the whole thoroughly, and dish up in 
a pyramidal form. Rub the yolks of eggs 
through a wire sieve, and sprinkle over the 
kedgeree. Sprinkle over likevdse some finely 
chopped parsley, and arrange the dish as neatly 
as possible. Place it in the oven for a few 
minutes, and send to table. Cold poultry or 
game can be prepared in exactly the same man- 
ner. 

Jugged Hare. — 1 hare, about 1 pint brown 
stock, 1 pint Espagnole sauce, 1 glass port wine, 
salt and pepper, a croilte of fried bread, a mire- 
poix consisting of 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 1 onion, a 
small bunch of savoury herds, 4 ounces bacon, 
and 2 ounces butter, 1 tablespoon red currant 
jelly, some croiitons or sippets of bread. Pro- 
cure the hare ready for cooking, joint it and 
cut in neat pieces. Clean the vegetables, 
scrape and peel them, and cut in slices. Cut 
the bacon in dice. Put the butter and bacon 
into a stewpan and add the vegetables; fry 
these a nice light brown, then add the pieces of 
hare and the bunch of herbs. Cook the whole 
over a brisk fire for about 20 minutes, stirring 
occasionally. Season with salt and pepper, 
moisten with the stock, boil up, skim, and add 
the sauce. Cover, and cook gently for about 1 
hour. Take out the pieces of hare and put 
them into another stewpan. Strain the sauce, 
skim it from fat, and add to the hare ; put in 
the wine and red currant jelly, and simmer for 
another 10 minutes. Fix the bread croute in 
the centre of a round entree-dish, dress the 
pieces of hare neatly on this, sauce over weU 
with the sauce, and garnish with croutons or 
sippets of fried or toasted bread. Savoury 
forcemeat balls are often used as garnish in 
place of the bread croiitons.

salt and pepper, and put into a saut^-pan with 

2 ounces of butter, and fry the cutlets a light 
brown on both sides. Drain them and place 
them between 2 dishes with a weight on top. 
When cold immerse the cutlets in lukewarm 
bechamel or allemande sauce so as to completely 
coat them. Place them on a wire tray and let 
cool. Crush finely a few cracknel biscuits, and 
roll the coated part of the cutlets in this, then 
dip them in beaten egg and crumb again with 
the biscuit. Keep the bones of the cutlets 
perfectly clean. Fry a nice colour in hot fat. 
Drain, disli up in a circle, fill the centre with 
fried parsley, put small paper frills on the 
bones, and send to table with a boat of cucum- 
ber sauce.

finely chopped, 1 dessert-spoon chopped pars- 
ley, 4 ounces streaky bacon, cut up very small, 
1 egg, fat for bakfag, bread crumbs. Trim 
the joint, removing any superfluous fat, etc.; 
remove the bones, and lay the joint on the 
table, spread it out, and season with salt and 
pepper ; sprinkle some of the herbs, parsley, 
and onion over the meat, place a layer of 
chopped bacon on the seasoning, and put the 
remainder of seasoning over the bacon. Roll 
up the meat, fasten it securely with string or 
with skewers, then put it on a baking-tin or 
flat braising-pan containing about 2 ounces 
dripping or butter, cover with greased paper, 
and bake in a moderate oven for about IV2 
hours. Baste frequently. Remove the paper, 
brush over with egg, and cover with bread 
crumbs ; put it again in the oven (quick heat) 
for another 20 or 30 minutes, according to the 
size of the joint. Keep it carefully basted 
during the whole process of cooking. When 
done draw out the string or skewers, place the 
joint on a hot dish, and serve it with a nicely 
flavoured thin brown gravy. 

Ragout of Mutton. — 3 pounds loin of mut- 
ton, 2 pints stock, 2 carrots, 1 bouquet garni, 2 
turnips, 4 ounces butter, 1 ounce flour, 8 or 10 
small button onions, a clove of garlic, salt and 
pepper, Mi glass claret. Cut the meat in neat 
pieces, pare off skin and fat, fry the pieces in 
the butter, and let them take a nice colour; 
then drain the pieces, and trim and cut the 
bones. Prepare the vegetables: cut the car- 
rots in olive shapes, and the turnips like 
pigeons' eggs, peel the onions, and fry each 
lot in the butter until they have attained a fine 
colour, take up and drain. Pour away some 
of the butter, put in the flour, and fry a nut- 
brown colour ; then moisten with the stock, 
add the claret, bouquet (the clove of garlic 
must first be fried a little), etc. ; boil up while 
stii'ring, skim, put in the meat (seasoned), and 
cook over bright fire for about half an hour. 
Put the fried vegetables with the stew, and 
simmer gently till tender. When done and 
ready for table, dress the meat in the centre 
of a dish, surround it with groups of vege- 
tables; reduce the sauce a little, and strain 
carefully over all. 



with a sharp knife, and fill the space with sage 
and onions, chopped, and a little pepper and 
salt. Score the skin in slices, but do not cut 
deeper than the outer rind, cook thoroughly 
before a clear fire or in a moderate oven. 
Apple sauce and potatoes should be served 
with it. 

Souse. — Clean pigs' feet and ears thoroughly, 
soak them a day in salt and water, boil tender, 
and split them. They are good fried. To souse 
them cold, pour boiling vinegar over them, 
spiced with mace and peppercorns. Cloves 
give them a dark colour, but improve their 
taste. If a little salt be added, they will keep 
good pickled for a month or two. 

Braised Sweetbread. — Well wash the sweet- 
bread, soak in cold water for an hour, blanch 
for 10 minutes, and press slightly until cold ; 
then cut away the sinewy fat, and lard the 
sweetbread, place into a stewpan with vege- 
tables and stock, and cover with greased paper ; 
braise carefully from 20 to 30 minutes. Take 
up, and put into the oven to brown the bacon. 
Strain the gravy, and reduce to a good glaze. 
Dish the sweetbread on a block of fried bread, 
and pour the glaze over it ; garnish with a 
mixture of cooked ham or tongue, truffles, and 
mushrooms, cut in large dice and warmed in a 
little of the glaze. 

Veal Cutlets. — 6 cutlets cut from a very 
small neck of veal, 1 dessert-spoon chopped 
parsley, 6 small slices of raw ham, bread crumbs, 
2 ounces butter, salt and pepper, V2 lemon, 1 
egg. Trim the cutlets, flatten each with a 
wetted cutlet-bat, pare the sides neatly, and 
scrape the bones clean. Season each side with 
salt and pepper. Melt a little butter (about V2 
ounce), add to this half the chopped parsley, 
and bnish over the cutlets with this ; sprinkle 
a little lemon juice over each. Beat up the 
egg, dip each cutlet in egg and cover with 
white-bread crumbs. See that they are well 
crumbed, and use white (soft) bread cnimbs 
for this; the bread crumbs should be mixed 
with the remainder of the parsley and about 1 
teaspoon finely chopped lemon rind. Melt the 
remainder of the butter in a saut6-pan ; when 
hot put in the cutlets, and fry over a quick 
fire till each side has acquired a nice golden 
brown ; then put the pan in a slow oven for 
about 15 minutes (they must be well cooked 
and on no account underdone). Arrange a 
pur^e of peas in the centre of a dish in pyra- 
mid form, dress the cutlets round this with 
alternate slices of fried ham; pour a little 
demi-giac4 sauce or rich gravy round the base 
of the dish, and serve. The ham may be fried 
in the same pan as the cutlets. 

Roman Pie. — Line a large pie-dish, pre- 
viously buttered, with macaroni. Have ready 
some cooked cold meat, such as veal, rabbit, 
chicken, tongue, ham, or game, cut it tip rather 
smaU and place in layers in the pie-dish. Pour 
a little white or brown sauce over each layer, 
and season to taste with salt, pepper, and a 
little grated nutmeg. When the dish is full, 
pour over a good layer of rich bechamel, 
sprinkle over some grated parmesan cheese, 
and cover neatly with boiled macaroni ; pour 
a little melted butter over macaroni, and strew 
over some more grated cheese. Bake in a hot 
oven for about Mi hour. See that the surface 
is nicely browned, and serve at once. 



To Roast a Leg of Pork. — Choose a small 
leg of fine young pork ; cut a slit in the knuckle

Scotch Collops. — ^ pound lean beef (steak), 
Mj small onion (finely minced), salt and pep- 
per, 1 ounce butter, Ms teaspoon flour, 1 gill 
stock. Mince or shred the meat finely, free 
from fat or skin. Melt the butter, fry the

f 

Relishes 

GOLDEN BUCK,— A "golden buck" is 
• merely a rarebit with the addition of a 
poached egg, which is put carefully on 
top before serving. 

Yorkshire Rarebit. — Same as "golden 
buck." only it has 2 thin sUces of broiled bacon 
on top instead of the egg. 

Welsh Rarebit. — Select richest and best 
American cheese, the milder the better, as 
melting brings out strength. To make 5 rare- 
bits, take 1 pound cheese, grate and put in tin 
or porcelain-lined saucepan ; add ale (old is 
best) enough to thin the cheese sufficiently, 
say about a wineglass to each rarebit. Place 
over fire, stir until it is melted. Have slice of 
toast ready for each rarebit (crusts trimmed) ; 
put a slice on each plate, and pour cheese 
enough over each piece to cover it. Serve 
while hot. 



Poultry 



To CLEAN POULTRY.— Use a lighted 
taper or piece of paper to singe the fowl. 
Untie feet, break bone, and loosen sinews 
just below the joint; pull out sinews and cut 
off the tips of the toes. Lay breast down, slit 
skin down backbone toward head ; loosen wind- 
pipe and crop and pull them out. Cut off neck 
close to body. Make small slit below end of 
breast-bone, put in the fingers, loosen intestines 
from backbone, take firm grasp of gizzard, and 
draw all out. See that inside looks clean, then 
wipe out with wet cloth. Wipe off skin with 
cloth. 

To Truss Poultry. — Fill inside with stuffing. 
(See Stuffings.) Have at least 1 yard fine twine 
in trussing-needle. Turn wings across back so 
that pinions touch. Run needle through thick 
part of wing under bone, through body and 
wing on other side. Press legs up against body, 
run needle through thigh, body, and second 
thigh, and tie firmly. 

To Roast Poultry.— Baste well with hot fat. 
Place on rack in roasting-pan and put in very 
hot oven. Roast 3 hours for 8-pound turkey, 
1 to l\<j hours for fowls, basting frequently. 
Keep oven very hot. If fowl is very large and 
heavy cover breast and legs with several thick- 
nesses paper to keep from burning. 



Ooose.— This requires keeping, the same as 
fowls, some days before cooking. The goose Is 
best in the autumn and early part of winter — 
never good in spring. What is called a green 
goose is four months old. It is insipid after 
that, though tender. Pick well and singe the 
goose, then clean carefully. Put the liver and 
gizzard on to cook as a turkey's. When the 
goose is ready for stuffing, chop 3 onions very 
fine, throw them into cold water, bring to the 
boil, then strain and add 2 tablespoons fresh 
bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon finely chopped sage, 
salt and pepper. When well mixed, stuff the 
goose with the mixture. Have ready a coarse 
needle and thread, and sew up the slit made for 
cleaning and introducing the stuffing. A full- 
grown goose requires from 2 to 2^4 hours. 
Roast it as a turkey, basting frequently. The 
gravy is prepared as for poultry, with the liver 
and gizzard. Apple sauce is indispensable 
with roast goose. 

Apple Sauce. — Peel, core, and slice tart ap- 
ples, stew in a small quantity of water until 
they break to pieces. Beat to a pulp with a 
good lump of butter and plenty of sugar. 

Roast Chicken — Select a medium-sized fat 
and tender chicken, singe and draw it, cut off 
the neck and part of the legs, wipe the inside 
with a damp cloth, and truss as usual for roast- 
ing. Wash the liver and heart, and put them 
in a baking-pan with a mirepoix, i.e., a small 
carrot, % turnip, 1 small onion, 3 or 4 thin 
slices of bacon, all cut up in dice. Season the 
chicken with pepper and salt, and place it on top 
of the mirepoix in the baking-tin, spread about 
an ounce of butter on top of the chicken, and 
cook in a hot oven for 20 minutes ; baste fre- 
quently. After this reduce the oven heat, and 
cook for another 20 minutes or so more slowly. 
When the chicken is done take up, untruss, 
place it on a dish, and keep hot. Pour off the 
fat from the baking-tin, add l\i gills of stock, 
boil this over the fire for a few minutes, season 
and colour to taste, strain, remove the fat if any 
is on the surface, pour a little around the 
chicken, and serve the remainder in a sauce- 
boat. Grarnish the dish with sprigs of crisp 
watercress. Bread sauce may be served if 
liked. 

Roast Crouse. — Singe, draw, and truss a 
brace of gi-ouse ; spread each bird with butter 
and wrap in a thin slice of fat bacon. Place 
in a roasting-pan, or suspend on the hook 
attached to the cross-bar, and roast in a brisk 
oven for 20 minutes. Baste frequently. If re- 
quired rather underdone allow 15 or 20 minutes 
only. When ready for serving, untruss the 
birds, dress them on croAtes of fried bread on a 
hot dish, garnish with watercress and fried 
bread crumbs. Serve with a boat of rich gravy. 

Bread Croutes. — Cut two slices of bread 
about an inch thick, pare off the crusts and 
shape neatly, oblong or oval, hollow out the 
centre a little so that the cavity will hold the 
birds nicely. Fry in deep fat (clarified dripping 
or butter) a golden colour. Drain carefully on 
paper or on a cloth, and fix them, by means of 
little batter or white of egg, on a dish ready for 
dressing the birds. 

Fricassee of Chicken. — Truss a young fowl 
for boiling and put it on to cook in a large stew- 
pan with 1 quart of hot water. Let it come to 
a boil slowly. When it reaches this point re-

celery, 3 or 4 sprigs of parsley, a bay-leaf, 2 
slices of onion, and a carrot. Season with salt 
and pepper. Simmer gently for ^4 hour, closely 
covered. As soon as done take it from the 
stock, untruss, and cut in neat joints. Make 
the sauce by cooking together in a saucepan 2

or more if small, disjoint them, cut backbone, 
etc., small as convenient. Simmer them with 
few slices of salt pork, in water enough to cover 
them, until half cooked, then take out breast 
bone. After they boil, and scum is taken off. 



put in a little onion cut very fine — not enough 
to taste distinctly, just enough to flavour a 
little ; rub some parsley very fine when dry, 
or cut fine when green ; this gives pleasant 
flavour. Season well with pepper and salt and 
2 ounces good fresh butter. Have liquid 
enough to cover chicken, then beat two eggs 
and stir in some sweet cream. Put into a pie- 
dish, cover with pastry, 3, and bake in a fairly 
hot oven. 

Stewed Chicken. — Prepare and cook 
chicken in the same manner as for chicken 
pie; just before chicken is quite done, pare

Vegetables 



HINTS ON COOKING VEQETABLES.— 
First, have them fresh as possible. 
Summer vegetables should be cooked 
on same day they are gathered. Second, look 
them over and wash well, cutting out all de- 
cayed or unripe parts. Third, lay them, when 
peeled, in cold water for some time before 
using. Fourth, always let water boil before 
putting them in, and continue to boU until 
done. 

Turnips. — Should be peeled, and boiled from 
40 minutes to an hour. 

Beets. — BoU from 1 to 2 hours ; then put 
into cold water and slip skin off. 

Spinach.— Boil 20 minutes. 

Parsnips. — Boil from 30 to 40 minutes. 

Onions. — Best boUed in 2 or 3 waters, add- 
ing milk the last time. 

String Beans. — Should be boiled 1 hour. 

Shell Beans. — Require V2 hour to an hour. 

Green Corn. — Boil 20 or 30 minutes. 

Green Peas. — Should be boiled in little water 
as possible ; boil 20 minutes. 

Asparagus. — Same as peas ; serve on toast. 

Cabbage. — Should be boiled from V^ hour to 
1 hour in plenty of water ; salt while boiling. 

Asparagus on Toast. — Cut stalks of equal 
length, rejecting woody portions and scrap- 
ings, the whiter parts retained. Tie in bunch 
with soft tape and cook about 30 minutes if of 
fair size ; if small, 20 minutes. Have ready 6 
or 8 slices nicely toasted bread. Drain the as- 
paragus ; untie, and arrange on toast. Pepper 
and salt to taste. 

Lima Beans. — Put a pint of beans in boil- 
ing salted water enough to cover. Cook until 
tender, then drain them. Melt a piece of 
butter the size of an egg, and mix an even tea- 
spoon of flour with it. Add a little stock, make 
a smooth sauce, cruse water instead. Put the 
beans into the sauce and set them at the side 
of the fire for 15 minutes. Just before serving 
add tablespoon of chopped parsley, and season 
to taste with salt and pepper. 



Buttered Parsnips. — Boil tender and 
scrape ; slice lengthwise. Put 3 tablespoons 
butter in a saucepan, with pepper, salt, and a 
little chopped parsley. When heated put in 
the parsnips. Shake and turn until mixture 
boils, then lay the parsnips in order upon a 
dish, and pour the butter over them and serve. 

To Boil Parsnips.— 1 large spoonful of salt 
to V3 gallon of water. If parsnips are young 
they require only to be scraped before boOing ; 
old ones must be peeled and cut in quarters. 
Put them into a stewpan of boiling salt and 
water. Boil them quickly until tender, take 
them up, drain them, and serve them on a 
vegetable-dish. Time, 30 to 40 minutes. 

Fried Onions. — Peel, cut across so as to form 
undivided rings. Flour them, fry 5 or 6 min- 
utes in hot fat. Drain, dredge with salt and 
pepper, and serve with beefsteak. 

Baked Macaroni. — Break % pound maca- 
roni in pieces an inch long, cook in boiling 
water, slightly salted, 20 minutes. Drain, and 
put a layer in bottom of a greased bake-dish, 
upon this some grated cheese and tiny bits of 
butter, then more macaroni, and so on, filling 
dish, with grated cheese on top. Moisten with 
a little milk and salt lightly. Cover and bake V2 
hour ; brown, and serve in the dish in which it 
is baked. 

Boiled Artichokes. — Soak the artichokes, 
wash them in several waters ; cut stalks even, 
trim away lower leaves and ends of the others ; 
boil in salted water with tops downwards ; let 
them remain until leaves can be easily drawn 
out. Before serving remove the choke and 
serve with oiled butter. 

Cauliflower. — Plunge a head of cauliflower 
into salt water several times to remove any in- 
sect. Boil 10 minutes in salt water, drain on 
sieve, put cauliflower into buttered dish. Melt 
piece of butter size of an egg; add to it 1 ta- 
blespoon flour, stir on the fire 1 minute ; add 
gill of milk, a quantity of grated cheese, pepper 
and salt. Stir this sauce till it boils. Pour 
over the cauliflower, sprinkle over it a few 
browned bread crumbs, set it in moderate oven 
for a few minutes to brown. 

Potatoes, Lyonnaise. — ParboU a dozen or 
more potatoes and set aside to get perfectly 
cold. When ready to cook them, heat some 
butter or good di-ippingin frying-pan ; fry in it 
1 small onion, chopped fine, until it begins to 
change colour. Then put in potatoes, cut in 
dice, not too thick or broad. Stir well and 
cook 5 minutes, taking care potatoes do not 
break to pieces. They must not brown. Put 
in some minced parsley just before taking up. 
Drain dry by shaking in a heated colander. 
Serve very hot. 

Potatoes, Stewed.— Pare and cut in strips 
lengthwise, cover with boiling water, and stew 
20 minutes. Pour off nearly all the water, put 
in a cup of cold milk with salt, bring to the 
boil, and serve. 

Potato Croquettes.— Season cold mashed 
potatoes with pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Beat 
to cream, with 1 tablespoon melted butter to 
every cup of potato. Add 2 or 3 beaten eggs 
and some minced parsley. Roll in small balls ;

dip into beaten egg, then into bread crumbs ; 
fry in hot lard. 

Saratoga Potatoes.— Take good potatoes; 
pee! and slice very thin with potato-slicer, let 
stand in cold salt and water for V^ hour ; dry 
them, and fry in boiling-hot lard, taking out 
soon as they are crisp and brown. 

Here are Three Ways to Prepare Pota= 
toes for Breakfast. — First, boil some small 
potatoes in their jackets. The moment they are 
done take them out of the water. Do not allow 
them to become soft, as they will not keep their 
shape. Remove the skins ; have some lard, 
very hot, as for fried cakes ; drop the potatoes 
into it and fry till brown, turning them gently 
from side to side. The next way is to heap 
mashed potatoes on a small baking-dish ; shape 
them like a pyramid and smooth perfectly ; 
then cover with a well-beaten egg, and set into 
the oven to brown. Still another way is to 
make little cakes of cold mashed potatoes; 
flour your hands well, and put on as much 
flour as will stick on the outside of the cakes ; 
scatter flour on the plate on which you lay 
them ; fry them brown in butter. 

* Fried Tomatoes.— Cut tomatoes in slices 
without skinning ; pepper and salt them ; then 
sprinkle a little flour over them and fry in butter 
until brown. Take them out, put on a hot 
dish, and pour milk or cream into the butter 
and juice. When boiling hot pour over tomar 
toes. 

Stuffed Tomatoes. — Get them as large and 
firm as possible ; cut a round place in top of 
each, scrape out all the soft parts; mix with 
stale bread crumbs, onions, parsley, butter, pep- 
per, and salt ; chop very fine, and fill tomatoes ; 
carefully bake in moderately hot oven ; put a 
little butter into pan ; see that they do not burn 
or become dry. 

Stewed Tomatoes with Onion and Bread. 

— Empty a tin of tomatoes into a saucepan, 
place over fire, and when hot add small onion 
sliced, with pepper, salt, and a little sugar. 
Stew 20 minutes, and add 1 tablespoon butter 
and a good handful bread crumbs. Simmer 5 
or 10 minutes, and pour out. 

Stewed Tomatoes, Plain. — Open a tin of 
tomatoes an hour before cooking them and 
turn them into a bowl ; leave out cores. Cook 
always in a steel or enamelled saucepan ; iron 
injures both colour and flavour. Stew gently 
for 40 minutes ; season to taste with salt, 
pepper, and, if preferred, a little sugar, and 1 
tablespoon butter. Cook gently, uncovered, 10 
minutes longer, and turn into a deep dish. 

Spinach with Eggs. — Boil spinach in the 
smallest quantity possible of hot water, salted, 
for 20 minutes. Drain and press out the water. 
Chop fine; put back over the fire with 1 table- 
spoon butter and 1 teaspoon sugar with salt 
and pepper to taste ; also a little nutmeg. Beat 
until hot and smooth; turn into a hot deep 
dish, and cover with nicely poached eggs. 

Green Peas.— Shell the peas and wash well 
in cold water. Cook in boiling water for 25 
minutes. A lump of sugar will be a pleasant 
addition to market peas. Drain well ; stir in a 
lump of butter, and pepper and salt. Serve 
hot. 



Canned Peas.— Open tin of peas 1 hour be- 
fore cooking them. When ready for them, 
put on in a milk-saucepan (or one saucepan 
within another) of hot water. If dry add cold 
water to cover them, and stew about 10 min- 
utes. Drain ; stir in a lump of butter, pepper 
and salt. 

Rice, Boiled.— Wash well and cook in boil- 
ing salted water, shaking up from time to time 
until the water is nearly all absorbed, and the 
rice soft, with every grain distinct ; put a good 
piece of butter on the top after it is dished. 

Boiled Onions. — Clean off top and root; 
skin and cook 15 minutes in boiling fresh wa- 
ter; salt slightly and boil untU tender all 
through; drain, butter well, add pepperand salt. 

String Beans. — Top and tail, and with a 
sharp knife strip off the strings on both sides ; 
cut in short pieces, and cook about 1 hour in 
boiling water and a little salt ; drain well ; heap 
upon a hot dish ; butter freely and season to 
taste. 

Boiled Haricot Beans. — Soak all night, 
and in the morning change the cold water for 
lukewarm ; let stand in this 2 hours ; drain off, 
and put them to boil in cold water, vdth a piece 
of fat salt pork 2 inches square. Cook slowly 
until soft ; take out the pork ; drain the beans 
well ; season with pepper, and serve. 

Beets. — Use care in cutting off the tops and 
washing them not to break the skins, or their 
colour will be drawn out by the water. Cook 
in boiling water 1 hour. Scrape, slice, and add 
salt, pepper, and butter, and pour a few spoons 
of boiling vinegar upon them after they are 
dished. 

Rice Croquettes. — 1 cup cold boiled rice, 
1 teaspoon sugar, and half as much salt, 1 tea- 
spoon oiled butter, 1 egg beaten light, enough 
mUk to make the rice into stiff paste, sweet 
lard for frying. Work rice, butter, egg, etc., 
into an adhesive paste, beating each ingredient 
thoroughly into the mixture. Flour your hands 
and make the rice in oval balls. Dip each into 
beaten egg, then into flour, and fry in boiling 
lard, a few at a time, turning each with great 
care. When the croquettes are of a good 
brown, take out with a -wire spoon and place 
on paper to drain. Serve hot, with sprigs of 
parsley laid about them, in an uncovered dish. 

Pickles 

USE glass bottles for pickles, also wooden 
knives and forks in preparation of them. 
PiU bottles 3/4 full with articles to be 
pickled, then fill bottles with vinegar. Use 
saucepans lined with earthenware or stone 
pipkins to boil vinegar in. 

Chow Chow. — 1 quart large cucumbers, 1 
quart small cucumbers, 2 quarts onions, 4 heads 
cauliflower, 6 green peppers, 1 quart green to- 
matoes, 1 gallon vinegar, 1 pound mustard, 2 
cups sugar, 2 cups flour, 1 ounce turmeric. Put 
all into salt and water one night ; cook all the 
vegetables in brine until tender, except large 
cucumbers. Pour over vinegar and spices.

Pickling Cauliflowers.— Take whitest and 
closest cauliflowers in bunches; spread on 
earthen dish, cover them with salt, and let 
stand 3 days to draw out all the water. Then 
put into jars, pour boiling salt and water over 
them, let stand overnight ; then drain with a 
hair sieve and put into glass jars ; fill up jars 
with vinegar ; cover tight. 

French Pickles. — 1 peck green tomatoes, 
sliced ; 6 large onions, a teacup salt thrown 
on overnight. Drain thoroughly, boil in 2 
quarts water and 1 quart vinegar 15 or 20 
minutes ; drain in colander ; then take 4 quarts 
vinegar, 2 pounds moist sugar, % pound white 
mustard seed, 2 tablespoons cloves, 2 table- 
spoons cinnamon ,^2 tablespoons ginger, 2 table- 
spoons ground mustard, 1 teaspoon cayenne 
pepper ; put all together, cook 15 minutes. 

Piccalilly. — 1 peck green tomatoes, sliced; 
Ml peck onions, sliced ; 1 cauliflower, 1 peck 
small cucumbers. Leave in salt and water 24 
hours ; then put into kettle with handful 
scraped horseradish, 1 ounce turmeric, 1 ounce 
cloves (whole), ^]pound pepper (whole), 1 ounce 
cassia buds or cinnamon, 1 pound white mus- 
tard seed, 1 pound English mustard. Place in 
kettle in layers, and cover with cold vinegar. 
Boil 15 minutes, constantly stirring. 

Pickled Red Cabbage. — Slice it into a col- 
ander, sprinkle each layer with salt ; let it drain 
2 days, then put into ajar, pour boiling vinegar 
enough to cover, put in a few slices of red beet- 
root. Choose purple red cabbage. Those who 
like flavour of spice wiU boil it with the vinegar. 
Cauliflower cut in bunches, and thrown in after 
being salted, will look red and beautiful. 

To Pickle Tomatoes. — Always use those 
that are thoroughly ripe. The small round 
ones are decidedly the best. Do not prick them, 
as most books direct. Let them lie in strong 
brine 3 or 4 days, then put down in layers in 
jars, mixing with small onions and pieces of 
horseradish. Then pour on vinegar (cold), 
which should be first spiced; let there be a 
spice-bag to throw into every pot. Cover care- 
fully, and set by in cool place, full month be- 
fore using. / , 

Spiced Fruits. — These are also called sweet 
pickled fruits. For 4 pounds prepared fruit 
allow 1 pint vinegar, 2 pounds moist sugar, Mi 
cup whole spices — cloves, allspice, stick cin- 
namon, and cassia buds. Tie spices in thin 
muslin bag, boil 10 minutes with vinegar and 
sugar. Skim, add fruit, cook till tender. Boil 
down syrup, pour over finiit in jars, and seal. 
If put in stone pots, boil syrup 3 successive 
mornings and pour over fruit. Currants, 
peaches, grapes, pears, and berries may be 
prepared in this way, also ripe cucumbers, 
muskmelons, and watermelon rind. 

Tomato Ketchup.— 1 gallon tomatoes 
(strained), 6 tablespoons salt, 3 tablespoons 
black pepper, 1 tablespoon cloves, 2 tablespoons 
cinnamon, 2 tablespoons allspice, IMi pints 
vinegar ; boil down Mi. 1 peck tomatoes will 
make 1 gaUon strained. 

Green Tomato Ketchup.— 1 peck green to- 
matoes, 1 dozen large onions, ^ pint salt; slice 
tomatoes and onions. To layer of these add 
layer of salt ; let stand 24 hours, then drain. 
Add \!i pound mustard seed, 3 dessert-spoons 



sweet oil, 1 ounce allspice, 1 ounce cloves, 1 
ounce ground mustard, 1 ounce ground ginger, 
2 tablespoons black pepper, 2 teaspoons celery 
seed, 1/4 pound moist sugar. Put all in pre- 
serving-pan, cover with vinegar, and boil 2 
hours, fi 

Walnut Ketchup:— Take green walnuts be- 
fore the shell is formed (usually in a proper 
state early in August). Grind them or pound 
them in an earthen or marble mortar. Squeeze 
out the juice through a coarse cloth, and add to 
every gallon of juice 1 pound of anchovies, 1 
pound salt, 4 ounces cayenne pepper, 2 ounces 
black pepper. 1 ounce each ginger, cloves, and 
mace, and the root of 1 horseradish. Boil 
all together till reduced to Mi the quantity. 
Pour off, and when cold bottle tight. Use in 3 
months. 

Cookery for the Sick 

FOOD FOR THE SICK.— Always prepare 
food for the sick in the most dainty and 
appetizing manner. In sickness the 
senses are unusually acute, and far more sus- 
ceptible to carelessness, negligence, and mis- 
takes in the preparation and serving of food 
than when in health. Special wants of the 
body show themselves in special cravings for 
certain articles of food. These should be 
gratified when possible. 

Infants' Food. — Let 1 quart of milk stand 
overnight; skim off the cream, and upon it 
pour 1 pint boiling water. In 1 quart water let 
1 tablespoon oatmeal boU about 2 hours and 
then strain. To 1 gill of the cream and water 
add 2 tablespoons of the oatmeal water. Sweeten 
it when given. This receipt comes from an ex- 
perienced nurse and has been well tested. 

Beef Tea. — To every pound of beef, cut fine 
(not chopped), add 1 pint cold water, and let 
stand 2 hours ; then place over a slow fire, or 
on the extreme back part of a range, where 
it may heat through very gradually ; then pull 
forward where it may come quickly to a simmer, 
or just below the boiUng point. Stir thoroughly 
at intervals of about 10 minutes. In 2 hours 
from time it is placed over the fire it may be 
considered done, although no harm will be done 
if it remains % hour longer, provided it does 
not boil ; strain through a strainer into an 
earthen bowl. If it has been properly cooked 
and not allowed to boU or get hot too quickly, 
there will remain but little sediment from the 
straining. If, on the other hand, these rules 
have not been observed, the body and sub- 
stance of the meat will remain in the strainer, 
leaving a thin, watery mixture of little value. 
Only practice and watchful care will enable 
the cook to bring the beef tea up to the boiling 
point without letting it boil. This is the test 
of the article. Do not salt while cooking, as 
that caiises it to separate. 

Calf's Feet Jelly.— Boil 2 calf s feet, well 
cleaned, in 1 gallon water until reduced to 1 
quart, then pour into a pan. When cold skim 
off all the fat and take up the jelly, leaving 
what settling may remain at the bottom. Put 
the jelly into a saucepan. Pour over it 1 pint 
good sherry or Madeira wine. Mi pound white

sugar, and the juice of 4 lemons. Add the 
whites and shells of 3 eggs, the former stiffly 
whipped and the shells well washed. Stir all to- 
gether thoroughly, place on lire, and let boil a 
few minutes. Pour into a large flannel bag, 
and repeat this until it runs clear ; then have 
ready a large china basin, and drop into it 
some lemon peel cut as thinly as possible. 
Let the jelly run into the basin; the lemon 
peel will not only give it a nice colour, but also 
a pleasant flavour. Fill the glasses and it will 
be ready to use. 

Egg on Toast. — Brown a slice of bread 
nicely, and whUe doing this break an egg into 
boUing water, and let it stand over the fire till 
the white hardens. Butter the toast, take up 
the egg with a skimmer, lay it on the toast, 
and serve. 

Flaxseed Tea. — Upon an ounce of unbruised 
flaxseed and a little pulverized liquorice root 
pour a pint of boiling (soft or rain) water, and 
place the vessel containing these ingredients 
near, but not on, the fire for 4 hours. Strain 
through a linen cloth. Make it fresh every 
day. An excellent drink in fever accompanied 
by a cough. 

Mint Tea.— Into an earthen vessel put a 
handful of the young shoots of mint, pour 
over them boiling water, cover closely, and set 
near the fire for an hour. Other herb teas are 
made in the same way. Mint tea is useful in 
allaying nausea and vomiting. 

Mutton Broth.— 3 pounds of lean mutton, 2 
turnips, 1 carrot, 2 onions, 1 bunch parsley, 3 
quarts water. BoU meat, cut in strips, and the 
vegetables, sliced, in the water 2^2 hours. The 
water should be reduced Vs. Strain, return 
the broth to the saucepan, with the vegetables, 
and the meat cut in small pieces. Rice, barley, 
or sago is often added to mutton broth. 

Scotch Broth.

Candies 



should be put in when candy is almost done. 
Flavours are more delicate when not boiled in 
candy, but added afterward. 

Butter Scotch.— 2 cups sugar, 2 tablespoons 
water, 1 ounce of butter. Boil without stirring 
until it hardens on a spoon. Pour on buttered 
plates to cool.

walnut on either side, and drop into sieved 
granulated sugar. For cream dates, take fresh 
fruit, remove stones, and fill centre with this 
same cream, then drop into sugar. 

Candied Popcorn. — Put into an iron kettle 
1 tablespoon butter, 3 tablespoons water, 1 
teacup white pulverized sugar. Boil until

Royal Baking Powder* 

ROYAL BAKING POWDER CO., NEW-YORK, MANUFACTURERS. 

Qualities Possessed by it Specially Requisite in the 
English Climate: 

THE Royal Baking Powder, being sold and shipped to every country In the 
world, is specially prepared by its manufacturers (the Royal Baking Powder 
Co., of New-York) to retain its strength and freshness under the variable tem- 
perature and moisture of every climate. 

No other baking powder has ever been produced that will keep its leavening 
strength in damp atmospheres so perfectly as the Royal. The contents of each tin 
of Royal are uniform in quality and the last spoonful in the opened tin will be found 
as good and effective as the first. 

This unique property of the Royal is of highest value and was particularly 
emphasized and commended by Dr. Saunders, the eminent Medical Officer of Health 
of London, in his report on baking powders. It is absolutely necessary to the pro- 
duction of perfect and uniform results. 

In the use of other baking powders great variableness is found. They are so 
readily affected by a moist atmosphere that they lose their strength quickly in any 
other than a perfectly dry and equable climate. Equal quantities from the same tin 
will not do even work. The prescribed quantity proves insufficient, the food is heavy, 
and good fiour, eggs and butter wasted. 

The Royal Baking Powder, for these reasons, is particularly serviceable in Great 
Britain, where it can be depended on to resist the influences of the moist atmo- 
sphere which so frequently prevails. 

In buying baking powder see that you get the product of the Royal Baking Powder 
Company, of New-York, who have brought this necessary household article to a per- 
fection unattained in any similar product. 

Invaluable as a Safeguard against Alum and 
Other Adulterants. 

Baking powders enter so generally into everybody's food that the question of their 
ingredients, whether they are healthful or otherwise, is of the utmost importance. 

The official tests show that Royal, made by the Royal Baking Powder Company, of 
New- York, is a cream of tartar powder of the highest leavening strength and efficiency, 
free from alum, lime, ammonia or harmful ingredient, and absolutely pure. 

The official tests likewise show that the market is full of low-grade powders, made 
from inferior or impure ingredients, to which alum is added to give them strength. 

Alum baking powders are classed as poisonous by the most eminent physicians- 
They cause indigestion, heartburn, dyspepsia and diseases of the liver and kidneys- 
Consumers who value their health must be on their guard against these dangerous 
powders. 

The housewife will find no possible substitute for the Royal Baking Powder. There 
is no other baking powder or preparation that will render the food so surely whole- 
Bome and excellent in every quality.

I have purchased in London samples of the Royal Baking Powder, manufactured 
in America. 

This is a pure and wholesome baking powder of the highest quality, surpassing 
all others within my knowledge. ALF. W. STOKES F.C.S. 

Public Analyst to Paddington, St. Luke, etc. 

Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh, Scotland. 
After careful chemical analysis, I am clearly of the opinion that the employment 
of the Royal Baking Powder of New York in place of yeast and other baking powders 
in the preparation of bread and pastry is a decided step in advance as regards whole- 
someness and freedom from noxious germs. I can recommend with confidence the 
use of the Royal Baking Powder. STEVENSON MACADAM, Ph.D., etc.. 

Professor of Chemistry and Consulting Analytical Chemist. 

City Laboratory, 17, Castle St., Dublin, Ireland. 
I have examined specimens of the Royal Baking Powder (of New York) and find 
it to be an excellent preparation for the purpose for which it is designed. The con- 
stituents of it are such as may be safely and continuously used in food, being alto- 
gether ot a wholesome character. It is admirably adapted for raising bread, and 
possesses great vesiculating power. 

I may add that for several years past this powder has been used in my own 
household. CHARLES A. CAMERON, M.D.,

I use no baking powder except the Royal of New York, and find it invaluable in 
the preparation of finer foods. (Mrs.) A. N. LINN. 

Board of Foreign Missions, New York. 
The Royal Baking Powder is being used by our missionaries in China, Japan, 
Corea, South Africa, etc. It is a pleasure to report its complete success in the mis- 
sions ki the tropics. Climatic changes, so fatal to most baking preparations, do not 
affect the properties of this powder, and so unfailing are the results of its use in aU. 
food preparations that our missionaries are supplied with it exclusively.

As the excellence of a baking powder Is dependent upon the yield of leavening gas, and 
upon the wholesomeness and purity of its ingredients, the Royal is unquestionably the best.
