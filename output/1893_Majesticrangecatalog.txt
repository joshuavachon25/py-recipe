Oh, better, no doubt, is a dinner of herbs, 

When season'd by love, which no rancor disturbs; 

But if, out of humor, and hungry, alone, 

A man should sit down to a dinner, each one 

Of the dishes of which the cook chooses to spoil 

On a horrible stove, with worry and toil, 

The chances are ten against one, we must own, 

He gets up as ill- tern per'd as when he sat down. 

Indigestion, that conscience of every bad stomach, 

Which relentlessly gnaws and pursues him with some ache 

And trouble remorseless, and makes him heart siek, 

Can be only avoided by the use of a '-Majestic." 



INTRODUCTION. 



In placing this book before the public, we do not claim originality, 
the recipes being largely borrowed from ''Practical Housekeeping.'" 
They have been carefully arranged with the view to being made readily, 
appetizingly and economically. 

Bad cooking is waste of money and loss of comfort. Thousands of 
people are deprived of half the actual nutriment of their food because 
of bad cooking and the absence of means to render it palatable and 
digestible. With the aid of these recipes, and the food cooked in the 
Majestic Range, much discomfort may be saved. 

One of the essentials to good cooking is to use the very best cooking 
apparatus. There is no economy in buying an inferior article ; get the 
best, and let the economy be shown in the way they are used. A few dol- 
lars additional cost ought not to deter people who have the health of 
their families at heart from procuring the necessaries of life. 

There is no article which enters more largely into our everyday life 
than the cooking range, and the greatest care should be taken to discrim- 
inate against those of inferior make; which may be avoided by using 
none but the MAJESTIC, which is made of the best selected material. 

It is becoming fashionable to economize, and housekeepers are really 
finding it a pleasant pastime to search out and stop waste in household 
expense, and to exercise the thousand little economies which thoughtful 
and careful women understand so readily and practice with such grace. 

Every young housekeeper must begin at the beginning, and blunder 
into a knowledge of the practical duties of a household, wasting time, 
temper and money in mistakes. 

With the simple instructions in this pamphlet, we hope that such 
blunders and mistakes will not occur. 



MAJESTIC RANGE COOK BOOK, 



TO OUR PATRONS. 

We present this, our latest Majestic Range Illustrated Catalogue 
and Cook-Book, with our compliments. 

Our esteemed and very liberal friends will accept our thanks for 
their zeal and earnest co-operation in aiding and assisting in the intro- 
duction, and placing in the homes of appreciative people, such a vast 
number of our Majestic Ranges; and we confidently anticipate, with 
their continued good- will, in the year 1893 to still very largely increase 
the sales. Never before in the experience of business has such a 
phenomenal trade in so short a time been built up. It was our aim from 
the inception of this enterprise, to make none but the best, and not to 
take from but to add to the value and efficiency of our goods, knowing 
that we and our customers would profit thereby. 

We needed your co-operation and received it; and in return we add to 
your stock of wealth, the most complete line of Majestic malleable and 
steel ranges ever placed before a discriminating people. The entire line is 
new and complete, with increased size of ovens ; improved pin extension 
waterfronts for pressure boilers or open tanks; new open water heater, 
connecting with oblong copper reservoir, doing away with the old style of 
pipe connections, which fill with lime incrustations and are so liable to 
burst by freezing; improved fire linings; enlarged lower warming ovens; 
new gravity oven door handles; new process for riveting (not bolting) 
malleable top frames to steel body; new and complete line of Hotel 
Ranges in all sizes; new copper-lined Steam Tables and Carving Tables; 
full line of Charcoal Broilers; our Combination Broiler and Waffle Irons; 
Laundry Stoves for families; and this our new and exquisite one-hundred- 
page Illustrated Cook Book, which will accompany every range sold. 
To these betterments we have added a little more nickel and polish, not 
sufficient, however, to materially increase the labor of the user or to 
injure the sale of the range. 

We feel that these changes and improvements, while costing us 
much money, will greatly facilitate sales and add popularity to the al- 
ready popular "Majestic." 

Anticipating your every want, and looking forward to the time when 
the demand will be only for "The Majestic,'' 

We are, as ever, yours truly, 

MAJESTIC MANUFACTURING CO.

FINISH OF MAJESTIC RANGES. 

All Majestic Ranges in ''family sizes" are finished in the sarne 
artistic manner, and in such exquisite taste, as to please the most fas- 
tidious. We have found that the sensible, practical, painstaking housewife 
is not enamored of too much nickel-plate and polish, knowing that 
everything added in excess of what is necessary for completeness only 

adds to the labor of herself or kitchen-maid. The nickel adornments on 

i 

the Majestic are placed where they show to the best advantage, we keep- 
ing in mind in the placing the now all-important question how to save 
and economize labor. As excessive ornamentation adds to the price 
without increasing the efficiency, we determined to finish the Majestic in 
the highest art, and are receiving our reward in praises and thanks from 
multitudes of esteemed patrons from all over this broad land. 

FINISH. The body of range and shelf, gloss black; the top and 
malleable parts, dark luster polish; the bands and shelf brackets, pol- 
ished and buffed; protecting bar and brackets, name and closet door 
plates, shelf corner irons, number plate, all door knobs and handles, 
towel bar and shaker crank, are nickel plated and polished. 

Some may say that even this is in excess of the demands of economic 
purchasers, but we justify the outlay in the knowledge that the masses 
are delighted, feeling that they are spending their money for an honest 
working range not for an overdressed parlor ornament.

OUR NEW GRATE. 

In the prefection of this grate, we claim that the highest degree of 
mechanism has been attained' It is distinct from and preferable to all 
other grates, in this, that it is the only one that operates equally well 
with either hard coal, soft coal or wood. 

It is so constructed that a quarter turn to the right reverses and 
changes from coal to wood, with oval surface, having two rows of half- 
inch holes running lengthwise. It is held in this position by the grate 
lock on front of housing. 




Diagonal Gra'e for Hard or Soft Coal. Diagonal Grate for Wood. 

Each grate revolves from its center, and a slight motion with shaker 
crank removes all ashes and clinker without dumping the burning fuel. 
The gear controlling this motion is two small cogs that mesh together on 
the outside of the fire-box, covered by housing, preventing the ashes from 
clogging. 

The Led plate in which the grate rest is fingered on both sides, and 
the grates when used for coal have large opening, insuring free and per- 
leet combustion. The entire construction is simple, durable and effective 
and for which we have our application on file for patent.

TESTIflONIALS. 

Thousands of Majestic Ranges are now in the homes of 
as many honest purchasers, each of whom would gladly 
give us permission to sign their names to any kind of testi- 
monial we might see proper to write ; but we feel that the re- 
cipes for good and wholesome food are of far greater value 
to our friends than to fill this book with recommendations. 
T\> suggest that you see your neighbors; if they do not pos- 
sess a " Majestic " advise them to buy one at once ; and after 
a trial exchange congratulations, which will be a recom- 
mendation to other neighbors and friends. Remember, 
that each and every "Majestic" is guaranteed to work to 
perfection. 



NOTE. On the three last pages of this book will be 
found Majestic Range cuts lettered A, B and C respectively. 
They are only designed to show attachments that can be 
connected with any family range on preceding pages. In 
ordering please be governed by the number on range, 
and from ranges A, B or C select such extra attachments 
as may be desired ; if Pressure Boiler or Charcoal Broiler, 
state which end of range to be connected, right or left. 
The price on hotel ranges includes double mantel shelf. 
.Our open reservoir as shown on family sixes cannot be 
connected with either 55, 56, 57, 58 or 59.

MATERIAL. 

The life of a range depends on quality more than on the 
weight of material. A range made of cast and wrought iron 
is heavier, but on account of its inferior character will not 
last half so long, as one made of malleable iron and wrought 
steel weighing much less. It is a well established fact, that 
ranges made of malleable and wrought steel and best gray 
iron are in every way superior to ranges made of wrought 
and cast iron, or of cast iron Avholly. Few people under- 
stand the process of making malleable or know the enormous 
expense connected with its manufacture for range work, nor 
have we the space to go into a detailed statement. Suffice 
to say. years in time and very large sums of money have 
been spent in bringing it up to its present high state of 
perfection. 

Majestic Eanges are made of material especially manu- 
factured for the purpose. The steel is cold rolled, thor- 
oughly annealed and double stretched, giving a smooth and 
level surface: the parts in malleable iron are fully decarbon- 
ized, making them strong, durable, and equal in tensile

strength to that of wrought iron they cannot be broken by 
rough usage; the gray iron is made of the best quality of 
pig, such as will stand the greatest amount of lire service. 

In our family size ranges the parts in malleable are as 
follows : Oven doors and frames, warming closet doors and 
frames, ash pan frames, top frames, fire doors and frames, flue 
and clean-out frames, back flue collars, shelf corner irons, door 
stakes, latch and latch catches, dampers and frames, damper 
rods, hooks, lugs, oven buttons, door handles and number 
plates. 

In hotel ranges the parts in malleable are : Oven doors 
and frames, oven door stakes, shoes, door handles and catches, 
ash pan frames, warming closet doors and frames, flue and 
clean-out doors and frames, shaker, cranks and lugs. The 
parts in steel: For range body, No. 14; oven body. No. 14; 
oven bottom, No. 10. In the largest sizes, two numbers 
heavier. 

With such material, and constructed as they are. 
Majestic Kanges will stand the test of years of hard usage 
without a break or flaw.

IMPROVED WATER HEATER FOR OPEN 

RESERVOIR. 

t> 

People who have used open reservoirs with water back and pipe 
connections are familiar with the annoyances occasioned by the filling 
and burning out and free/.ing and bursting of such connections; but they 
have not given tin- matter thought sufficient to understand the cause. 

Water contains more or less mineral and vegetable matter, and when 
heaiedto above 212 degrees such matter is left as a deposit in pipes or 
water heater, which gradually fills the entire space, and there being no 
way of cleaning the>e parr- burn out. 

Should the water freeze in these connections, the vent from heater to 
re.-crvoir is cut off. the result being the bursting or explosion of water 
back, sometimes with force sufficient to wreck the entire apparatus; in 
fact, there are instances where by these explosions people have been 
killed. 

With our new water connection as shown on this page, these dan- 
gerous complications are jj^&^ fully overcome, as by its 
open connection with |j|^Jf|^^^ f *k|& reservoir it can readily 
be cleaned ; and there being a free open outlet 
from heater to reservoir -JP renders it absolutely safe 
from explosion by freezing. 

This improvement is of such importance to purchasers that they 
should examine carefully any cooking apparatus with reservoir connec- 
before buying; an abundance of hot water and absolute safety 
should be the recommending feature. 



" MAJESTIC" IN SEASON- MAJESTIC.' 



MAJESTIC RANGE COOK BOOK. 



OUR NEW PIN EXTENSION WATER FRONT. 

For years the ever-present and all-important question with Range 
and Stove manufacturers has been, how to increase the heating surface 
of water backs so as to give a supply of hot water adequate for the de- 
mands, without encroaching upon the fire space or detracting from the 
baking qualities of the ovens, 

Pipes, coils and water backs of varied and multiple forms have been 
deviled, yet none of them can be referred to as doing the work required. 

Knowing that a aCT^--^. water back in contact 

with the oven chilled fSOp&^^T^------^^ and destroyed its effi- 

ciency, and desiring 1B| _<f' ^^fe^^S to give the best results 

both in water heating ^*^1 I :inc ^ baking qualities 

of our ranges, we ^^*^^._ I i nvente ^ tni * new 

water back; and know ^^^^ that we have what 

has been so long and earnestly sought. It is inexplicable that some one 
before this did not study it out. 

This heater, for ranges family sixes, contains 202 square inches of 
direct impinging fire surface; and for hotel sizes, from 225 to 262 square 
inches. In family ranges the heater is placed on the left side of fire 
box, the pins projecting into the hottest fire. In hotel ranges it can be 
placed on either side, as these ranges have large center flues next to fire 
box, hence the water backs do not affect the oven. 

The accompanying cut illustrates the form and construction, and 
shows its wonderful capacity and heating'power. Patents for this inven- 
tion have been applied for.

BREAD MAKING. 



The old saying, "Bread is the staff of life." has sound reason in it. 
Flour made from wheat, and meal from oats and Indian corn, are rich in 
the waste-repairing elements starch and albumen and head the list of 
articles of food for man. 

Good bread makes the homeliest meal acceptable, and coarse fare 
appetixing. while the most luxurious table is not even tolerable without 
it. There is an old and true saying tbat " She who has baked a good batch 
of bread has done a good day's work." 

Bread-making should stand at the head of domestic accomplishments, 
since the health and happiness of all depend immeasurably upon good 
bread; and there is certain to come a time in the experience of every true 
and thoughtful woman that she is glad and proud of her ability to. make 
nu-r. sweet loaves, free from soda, alum and other injurious ingredients: 
or bitter regret that she neglected to learn, or was so unfortunate as not 
to have been taught at least, the first requisites of good bread-making. 

Four things are indispensable, to success: Good flour, good yeast, 
watchful care, and a Majestic Range in which to bake it. 

Bread Sponge. Six potatoes boiled on a Majestic Range and 
mashed while hot, two tablespoons of white sugar, two of butter, one 
quart tepid water; into this stir three cups flour; beat to a smooth batter, 
add six tablespoons yeast; set over night, and in the morning knead 
in sufficient flour to make a stiff, spongy dough; knead vigorously 
for fifteen minutes, set away to rise, and when light knead for ten 
iniir.ites; mold out into moderate-sized loaves, and let rise until they are 
like delicate or light sponge-cake. 

Sponge for Winter Use. Peel and boil on a Majestic Kange 
four or five medium-sized potatoes in two quarts of water (which will 
boil down to one quart by the time the potatoes are cooked) ; when done, 
take out and press through a colander, or mash very fine in the crock in 
which the sponge is to be made; make a well in the center, into which 
put one cup of flour, and pour over it the boiling water from the potatoes; 
stir thoroughly, and when cool add a pint of tepid water, flour enough to 
make a thin batter, and a cup of yeast. This sponge makes very moist 
bread. 

Good Bread. For four small loaves boil four large potatoes; 
when done pour off the water, and when it cools add to it a yeast cake ; 
mash the potato very fine, put through a sieve, pour boiling milk on as 
much flour as is needed, let stand until cool, add the potato and yeast, a 
large teaspoon of salt and one tablespoon of sugar; stir very stiff, adding 
flour as is needed. Let stand in a warm place until light, dissolve one 
teaspoon of soda in a little hot water, mix well through with the hands, 
mold into loaves, and let rise again. When sufficiently raised place in a 
moderately hot Majestic Eange oven, keeping up a steady fire.

Bread with Buttermilk. The evening before baking, bring to 
the boiling point two quarts of buttermilk (or boil sour milk and take the 
same quantity of the whey), and pour into a crock in which a scant tea- 
cup of sifted flour has been placed. Let stand until sufficiently cool, then 
add half a cup of yeast, and flour to make a thick batter; the better and 
longer the sponge is stirred the whiter will be the bread. In the morn- 
ing sift the flour into the bread-pan, pour the sponge in the center, stir in 
some of the flour, and let stand until after breakfast; then mix, kneading 
for about half an hour the longer the better; when light, mold into 
loaves, this time kneading as little as possible. .The secret of good bread 
is having good yeast and net baking too hard. This makes four loaves 
and forty biscuit. Bake in a Majestic Range. 

Hop-Yeast Bread. One teacup yeast, three pints warm water; 
make a thin sponge at tea time, cover and let it remain two hours or until 
veiy light. By adding the water to the flour first? and having the sponge 
quite warm it is never necessary to put the sponge over hot water or in an 
oven to make it rise. Knead into a loaf before going to bed; in the 
morning mold into three loaves, spreading a little lard between as they 
are put in the pan. When light, bake in a Majestic Range one hour, 
having oven quite hot when the bread is put in, and very moderate when 
it is done. (Bread made in this way is never sour or heavy.) To have 
fine, light biscuit, add shortening at night, and in the morning make into 
biscuit and bake for breakfast. By this recipe bread is baked before the 
range is cold from breakfast, and out of the way for other baking. 

To cool bread there should be a board for the purpose. An oaken 
board covered with heavy white flannel is the best; over this spread a 
fresh linen bread-cloth, and lay the bread on it right side up, with noth- 
ing over it except a very thin cover to keep off the flies. It should be 
placed immediately in the fresh air or wind to cool ; when cool, place im- 
mediately in a tin box or stone jar, and cover closely. Bread cooled in 
this way will have a soft crust and be filled with pure air. 

Poor-Man's Bread. One pint of buttermilk or sour milk, one 
level teaspoon soda, a pinch of salt, and flour enough to make as stiff as 
soda-biscuit dough; cut into three pieces, handle as little as possible, roll 
an inch thick, place in dripping-pan, bake in a Majestic Range twenty or 
thirty minutes in a hot oven, and, when done, wrap in a bread-cloth. 
Eat while warm, breaking open like a biscuit. Each cake will be about 
the size of a pie. 

Bread with Mush. Pour two quarts hot corn meal .mush, made 
as for eating, over two quarts flour (wheat or graham) ; when cool add 
one quart sponge, one coffee cup molasses, one teaspoon salt, half tea- 
spoon soda; mix w r ell together; add more flour if needed, and knead 
thoroughly; mold into small loaves; let rise and bake in small dripping 
pans (a loaf in a pan), or pie tins, in a Majestic Range in a moderate 
oven ; when done rub over with butter, place on the side, wrap in a cloth, 
and when cold put in a jar or box. This recipe makes three good-sized 
loaves and keeps moist longer than all graham bread.

MAJESTIC RANGE COOK BOOK. 

Salt-Rising Bread. The leaven for this bread is prepared thus: 
Take a pint of warm water about ninety degrees (if a little too hot de- 
feat is certain) in a perfectly clean bowl and stir up a thick batter, adding 
only a teaspoon of salt; a thorough beating of the batter is important. 
Set in a pan of warm water to secure uniformity of temperature, and in 
two to four hours it will begin to rise. The rising is much more sure if 
coarse flour or shorts'' is used instead of fine flour. 

When your rising" is nearly light enough, take a pint of milk and 
a pint of boiling water (a tablespoon of lime water added is good and 
often prevents souring) ; mix the sponge in the bread-pan, and when 
cooled to about milk-warm stir in the rising. The sponge thus made will 
be light in two to four hours, with good warmth. The dough requires 
'leading than yeast-raised dough. The bread is simpler, but not so 
certain of rising, and you leave out all the ingredients save the flour, 
water (milk is not essential), and a pinch of salt. It should be made 
more frequently as it dries faster than bread containing potatoes. Some 
object to it because of the odor in rising, which is the result of acetous 
fermentation, but the more of that the more sure you are having sweet 
bread when baked. Bake in a Majestic Range. 

BroAvn Bread. Two and one-half cups sour milk, and one-half 
cup molasses; into these put one heaping teaspoon soda, two cups corn 
meal, one cup graham flour and one teaspoon salt. Use coffee cups. 
Steam three hours, and afterwards brown in a Majestic Range oven. 

Boston Brown Bread. One heaping coffee cup eaclj of corn, rye 
and graharn meal. The rye meal should be as fine as the graham, or rye 
flour may be used. Sift the three kinds together as closely as possible, 
and beat together thoroughly with two cups of New Orleans or Port Rico 
molasses, two cups sweet milk, one cup sour milk, one dessertspoon soda, 
one teaspoon salt; pour into a tin form, place in a kettle of cold water, 
put on a Majestic Range and boil four hours. Put on to cook as soon as 
mixed. It may appear to be too i^in, but it is not, as this recipe has 
never been known to fail. Serve warm, with baked beans or Thanksgiv- 
ing turkey. The bread should not quite fill the form (or a tin pail with 
cover will answer), as it must have room to swell. See that the water 
does not boil up to the top of the form; also take care that it does not boil 
entirely away or stop boiling. To serve it, remove the lid and set it a few 
moments into the open oven to dry the top, and it will then turn out in 
perfect shape. This bread can be used as a pudding, and served with a 
sauce made of thick sour cream, well sweetened and seasoned with nut- 
meg ; or it is good toasted the next day. 

Eastern Brown Bread. One pint each of rye or graham and In- 
dian meal, one cup molasses, three-fourths cup sour milk, one and one- 
half teaspoons soda, one and one-half pints cold water. Put on range 
over cold water (all brown breads are better when put on to steam over 
cold water, which is afterwards brought to the boiling point and kept 
constantly boiling until bread is done) ; steam four hours, and brown over 
in the Majestic Range oven.

Bread, in Summer or Winter. In summer take three pints of 
cold or tepid water, four tablespoons of yeast, one teaspoon of salt; stir in 
flour enough to make a thick sponge (rather thicker than griddle-cakes). 
Let stand until morning, then add more flour, mix stiff, and knead ten 
minutes; place in a pan, let rise until light, knead for another ten 
minutes; mold into four loaves and set to rise, but do not let it get too 
light. Bake in a Majestic Range in a moderate oven one hour. If bread 
is mixed at six o'clock in the morning the baking ought to be done by ten 
o'clock. 

In winter take one pint of buttermilk or clabbered milk ; let it scald 
(not boil) ; make a well in the center of the flour; into it turn the hot 
milk, add one teaspoon of salt, enough flour and water to make sufficient 
sponge, and one teacup of yeast; let stand until morning, and then pre- 
pare the bread as in summer. This is more covenient to make in winter, 
since a hot fire is needed to heat the milk. 

Corn Bread. One pint corn meal sifted, one pint flour, one pint 
sour milk, two eggs beaten light, one-half cup sugar, piece of butter size 
of an egg; add, the last thing, one teaspoon soda in a little milk; add to 
beaten egg the milk and meal alternately, then the butter and sugar. If 
sweet milk is used, add one teaspoon cream tartar;- bake twenty minutes 
in a hot oven in a Majestic Range. 

Corn Bread. Take one quart buttermilk, and one heaping pint 
corn meal, one teaspoon soda, one of salt, one tablespoon sugar and three 
eggs ; have the range very hot, and do not bake in too deep a pan. The 
batter seems too thin, but bakes very nicely in a Majestic Range. 

Plain Corn Bread. One well-heaped pint corn meal, one pint 
sour or buttermilk, one egg, one teaspoon soda, one of salt; bake in drip- 
ping or gem pans in a Majestic R'ange. If preferred, one heaping table- 
spoon of sugar may be added. 

Graham Bread. Mix three quarts Graham flour, one quart warm 
water, half pint yeast, a quarter pint molasses, and one tablespoon salt 
thoroughly; put in well-buttered pans, and leave in a warm place to rise, 
or let it rise over night at 60. If left to rise slowly, let it remain in the 
bowl in which it was mixed, and unless very light when put in pans let it 
stand fifteen or twenty minutes before putting in the oven. Bake in a 
Majestic Range. 

Graham Bread. To one and a half pints of tepid water add one 
heaping teaspoon of salt and one-half cup of sugar; stir in one-half pint 
or more of the sponge made of white flour, as in recipe for u Bread with 
Potato Yeast; " add Graham flour until almost too stiff to stir; put in the 
baking-pan and let rise well, which will take about two hours; bake in a 
Majestic Range in a moderate oven, and when done wrap in a wet towel 
until cool. 

Quick Graham Bread. One and a half pints sour milk, half cup 
New Orleans molasses, a little salt, two teaspoons soda dissolved in a 
little hot water, and as much Graham flour as can be stirred in with a 
spoon; pour in well-greased pan, put in oven as soon as mixed, and bake 
two hours in a Majestic Range.

Rye and Indian Bread. One quart of rye meal or rye flour, two 
quarts of Indian meal, scalded (by placing in a pan and pouring just 
enough boiling water over it, stirring constantly with a spoon, to merely 
wet it, but not enough to make it into a batter), one-half teacup uio- 
la^ses. two teaspoons salt, one of soda, one teacup yeast; make as stiff as 
can be stirred with a spoon, mixing with warm water, and let rise all 
night; then put in a large pan, smooth the top with the hand dipped in 
cold water, let it stand a short time, and bake five or six hours in a Ma- 
jestic Range. If put in the oven late in the day let it remain all night. 
Graham may be used instead of rye, and baked as above. In the olden 
time it was placed in kettle, allowed to rise, then placed on the hearth 
before the fire, with coals on top of lid, and baked. 

Rye Bread. Make a sponge of one quart warm water, one teacup 
yeast, thickened with rye flour; put in warm place to rise over night; 
scald one pint corn meal; when cool add it to sponge, and add rye flour 
till thick enough to knead, knead but little, let rise, mold into loaves, 
place in deep pie tins or small pudding-pans, let rise, and bake in a Ma- 
jestic Kange. Or. thicken the sponge with rye flour, and proceed as 
above. Wheat sponge ma}' be used instead of rye. 

The Best Ginger Bread. One and one-half cups of molasses, 
one-half cup of brown sugar, one-half cup of butter, one-half cup of 
sweet milk, one teaspoonful of soda, one teaspoonful each extracts of cin- 
namon and ginger. Bake in shallow pan in a Majestic Range. 

Buttered Toast. Although toast is commonly used few know 
how to prepare it nicely. Take bread not too fi'esh, cut thin and evenly, 
trim off the crust edges for the crumb jar; first warm each side of the 
bread, then present the first side again to the fire until it takes on a rich, 
even, brown color; treat the other side in the same way; butter and serve 
immediately. The coals should be bright and hot. Toast properly made 
is very digestible, because all the moisture is extracted, and the bread 
has become pure farina of wheat ; but when it is exposed to a hot fire and 
the outside charred, the inside remains as moist as ever, and butter ap- 
plied to it while warm does not penetrate, but floats on the surface in the 
form of rancid oil. Or, beat one cup of butter and three tablespoons of 
flour to a cream, pour over this one and a half pints boiling water; place 
over a kettle of boiling water for ten minutes, dip into it the toast, and 
serve hot. Or, dip each slice of toast in boiling hot water (slightly 
salted), spread with butter, cover and keep hot. 

Breakfast Toast. Add to one-half pint of sweet milk two table- 
spoons sugar, a little salt and a well-beaten egg; dip in this slices of 
bread (if dry let it soak a minute), and fry on a buttered griddle on a 
Majestic Range until it is a light brown on each side. This is a good 
way to use dry bread. 

Mennonite Toast. Beat up three eggs well, add a pint of sweet 
milk and a pinch of salt; cut slices an inch thick from a loaf of baker's 
bread, remove crust, dip slices into the eggs and milk, fry like doughnuts 
in very hot lard or drippings till a delicate brown, on a'Majestic Range, 
butter, and sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve hot.

BISCUITS, ROLL5, TEA CAKES, ETC. 



Biscuit. Dissolve one rounded tablespoon of butter in a pint of hot 
milk; when lukewarm stir in one quart of flour, add one beaten egg, a 
little .salt, and a teacup of yeast; work into dough, until smooth. If win- 
ter, set in a warm place; if summer, in a cool one to rise. In the morn- 
ing work softly and roll out one-half inch and cut into biscuit and set to 
rise for thirty minutes, when they will be ready to bake in a Majestic 
Range. These are delicious. 

Soda Biscuit. Put one quart of flour, before sifting, into sieve, 
with one teaspoon soda and two of cream tartar (or three of baking pow- 
der), one of salt, and one tablespoon white sugar; mix all thoroughly 
with the flour, run through sieve, rub in one level tablespoon of lard or 
butter (or half and hatf), wet with half pint sweet milk, roll on board 
about an inch thick, cut with biscuit cutter, and bake in a Majestic Range 
in a quick oven fifteen minutes. If you have not milk, use a little more 
butter, and wet with water. Handle as little and make as rapidly as 
possible. 

Hard Tea Biscuit. Two pounds of flour, one-fourth pound but- 
ter, one saltspoon salt, three gills milk; cut up the butter and rub it in 
the flour, add the salt and milk, knead dough for half an hour, cut cakes 
about as large as a small teacup and half an inch thick, prick with a fork, 
and bake in a Majestic Range in a moderate oven until they are a delicate 
brown. 

South Carolina Biscuit. One quart sweet cream or milk, one 
and a half cups butter or fresh lard, two tablespoons white sugar, one 
good teaspoon salt; add flour sufficient to make a stiff dough, knead well 
and mold into neat, small biscuit with the hands, as our grandmothers 
used to do; add one good teaspoon cream tartar if preferred; bake well in 
a Majestic Range, and you have good sweet biscuit that will keep for 
weeks in a dry place, and are very nice for traveling lunch. They are 
such as we used to send to the army, and the " boys " relished them 
'* hugely." 

Breakfast Rolls. Mix the dough in the evening, according to 
directions in the recipe for making good bread ; add a tablespoon of 
butter, and set where it will be a little warm until morning; cut off 
pieces, and carefully shape them into rolls of the desired size by rolling 
them between the hands, but do not knead them ; dip the sides of each 
into drawn butter when they are shaped, and place them in the baking 
pan (the butter prevents their sticking together when baked, and they 
will be smooth and perfect when separated). Rub them over the top 
with drawn butter, and dust a little fine salt over the top ; set in a warm 
place, and they will quickly rise ready for baking in a Majestic Range. 
These are delicious.

Coffee Rolls. Work into a quart of bread dough a rounded table- 
spoon of butter and a balf teacup of white sugar ; add some dried currants 
(well washed and dried in the oven), sift some flour and sugar over them, 
work into the other ingredients, make into small rolls, dip into melted 
butter, place in tins, let rise a short time, and bake in a Majestic 
Range. 

E very-day Rolls. Take a piece of bread dough on baking day 
when molded out the last time, about enough for a small loaf, spread out 
a little, add one egg, two tablespoons of sugar, and three-fourths cup of 
lard; add a little flour and a small teaspoon soda if the least bit sour; 
mix well, let rise, mold into rolls or biscuits, set to rise again, and they 
will be ready for the oven in twenty or thirty minutes. Bake in a Ma- 
jestic Eange. 

Vienna Rolls. Have ready in a bowl a tablespoon of butter or 
lard, made soft by warming a little, and stirring with a spoon. Add to 
one quart of unsifted flour two heaping teaspoons baking powder; mix and 
sift thoroughly together, and place in a bowl with butter. Take more or 
less sweet milk as may be necessary to form a dough of usual stiffness, 
according to the flour (about three-fourths of a pint), put into the milk 
half a teaspoon of salt, and then stir it into the flour, etc., with a spoon, 
forming the dough, which turn out on a board and knead sufficiently to 
make smooth. Roll out half an inch thick and cut with a large round 
cutter ; fold each one over to form a half round, wetting a little between 
the folds to make them stick together; place on buttered pans so as not to 
touch, wash over on top with milk to give them a gloss, and bake imme- 
diately in a hot oven in a Majestic Range about twenty minutes. It will 
do them no harm to stand half an hour before baking if it is desired. 

Sally JLunn. Sift into a pan a pound and a half of flour, put in two 
ounces of butter warmed in a pint of new milk, one saltspoon salt, three 
eggs well-beaten, and two tablespoons of good yeast. Mix well together, 
and put the whole into a tin pan well greased, and set to rise all night. 
Bake a little brown in a quick Majestic Range oven. Warm the milk and 
butter over water until the butter is melted; beat the eggs in a two-quart 
tin pail, and if the milk is not hot pour it over them. Stir in half the 
flour, then add the yeast, stirring thoroughly with the rest of the flour. 
Let rise over night. Some add two tablespoons sugar and use a teaspoon 
soda and two of cream tartar instead of the yeast. 

Rusk. One pint milk, three eggs, one teacup each of butter and 
sugar, and one coffee cup potato yeast; thicken with flour and sponge 
over night; in the morning stir down, let rise, and stir down again; when 
it rises make into a loaf, and let rise again; then roll out like soda biscuit, 
cut and put in pans, and, when light, bake carefully. Or, when baking 
take four cups dough, one-half cup butter, one cup sugar,-three eggs ; 
mix thoroughly, adding enough flour to mold easily; let rise, make into 
rather high and nai'row biscuit, let rise again, rub the tops with a little 
sugar and water, then sprinkle over them dry sugar. Bake twenty min- 
utes in a Majestic Range.

of Hereford's Bread Preparation; stir well, and bake at once in waffle 
irons on a Majestic Range. 

Quick Waffles. Two pints sweet milk, one cup butter (melted), 
sifted flour to make a soft batter; add the well-beaten yolks of six eggs, 
then the beaten whites, and lastly (just before baking) four teaspoons 
baking powder, beating very hard and fast for a few minutes. These are

with a strong blast before grinding, and the greatest care taken through 
the whole process. Adulteration with rye or corn cheapens the flour but 
injures the quality. The pure buckwheat is best and is unsurpassed for 
griddle-cakes. To make batter, warm one pint sweet milk and one pint 
water (one may be cold and the other boiling) ; put half the mixture in a 
stone crock, add five teacups buckwheat flour, beat well until smooth, add 
the rest of the milk and water, and last a teacup of yeast. Or, the same 
ingredients and proportions may be used except adding two tablespoons 
of molasses or sugar, and using one quart of water instead of one pint 
each of milk and water. Cook on a Majestic Range. 

French Pancakes. Beat together till smooth six eggs and half a 
pound of flour, melt four ounces butter and add to the batter with one 
ounce of sugar and half a pint of milk, and beat until smooth. Put a ta- 
blespoon at a time into a hot frying-pan slightly greased, spreading the 
batter evenly over the surface of the pan by tipping k about, fry to a light 
brown on a Majestic Range, spread with jelly, roll it up, dust it with 
powdered sugar, and serve hot. 

Bread Cakes. Take stale bread and soak over night in sour milk; 
in the morning rub through a colander, and to one quart add the yolks of 
two eggs, one teaspoon salt, one teaspoon so'da, two tablespoons sugar, 
and flour enough to make batter little thicker than for buckwheat cakes; 
add last the well-beaten whites of the eggs and bake on a Majestic Range. 

Corn Cakes. One pint cornmeal, one of sour milk or buttermilk, 
one egg, one teaspoon soda, one of salt. A tablespoon of flour or corn 
starch may be used in place of eggs. Bake on a griddle on a Majestic 
Range. 

Flannel Cakes. Make hot a pint of sweet milk and into it put 
two -heaping tablespoons butter, let melt, then add a pint of cold milk, 
the well-beaten yolks of four eggs placing the whites in a cold place a 
teaspoon of salt, four tablespoons potato yeast, and sufficient flour to 
make a stiff batter; set in a warm place to rise, let stand three hours or 
over night; before baking add the beaten whites; fry like any other grid- 
dle-cakes on a Majestic Range. Be sure to make batter stiff enough, for 
flour must not be added in the morning unless it is allowed to rise again. 

Indian Pancakes. One pint Indian meal, one teaspoon salt, 
small teaspoon soda; -pour on boiling water until a little thinner than 
mush; let stand until cool, add the yolks Qf four eggs, half a cup of flour 
in which is mixed two teaspoons cream tartar; stir in as much sweet milk 
or water as will make the batter suitable to bake; beat the whites well 
and add just before baking in a Majestic Range. 

Plantation Buckwheat Cakes. One quart best buckwheat 
flour, one handful of corn meal, two teaspoonfuls baking powder, one 
teaspoonful salt, two tablespoonfuls New Orleans molasses, one table- 
spoonful melted butter. Mix thoroughly; cook on a Majestic Range, as 
soon as ready.

Fried Mush. A delicious breakfast relish is made by slicing cold 
mush thin and frying in a little hot lard on a Majestic Range. Or dip in 
beaten eggs salted to taste, then in bread or cracker crumbs, and drop in 
hot lard like doughnuts. 

Graham Mush. Sift meal slowly into boiling salted water, stir- 
ring briskly until it is as thick as can be stirred with one hand ; serve 
with milk or cream and sugar, or butter and syrup. It is much improved 
by removing from the kettle to a pan as soon as thoroughly mixed, and 
steaming for three or four hours. It may also be eaten cold, or sliced and 
fried like com mush. Cook on a Majestic Range. 

Oatmeal Mush. To two quarts boiling water well salted add one 
and a half cups best oatmeal (Irish, Scotch, Canadian or Akron are best) ; 
stir in meal by degrees, and after stirring up a few times to prevent its . 
settling down in a mass at the bottom, leave it to cook three hours with- 
out stirring. While stirring in the meal put inner kettle directly on 
range. (Cook in a custard kettle with water in outer kettle). To cook 
for breakfast it may be put on over night, allowing it to boil an hour or 
two in the evening, but it is better when freshly cooked. Serve with 
cream and sugar. This is unsurpassed as a breakfast dish, especially for 
growing children, who need bone and muscle-producing food. To be 
wholesome it must be well cooked, and not the pasty, half-cooked mass 
usually served at boarding-houses. There are a few persons with very 
delicate digestive powers who should eat oatmeal only when thoroughly 
pearled, as the outer husks of the grain irritate the coatings of the stom- 
ach. In lieu of a custard kettle the mush may be made in a pan or small 
tin bucket, and then placed in a steamer and steamed two hours on a Ma- 
jestic Range. 

Steamed Oatmeal. To one teacup oatmeal add one quart cold 
water, teaspoon salt; put in steamer over a kettle of cold water, and 
steam one hour and a half on a Majestic Range after meal begins to cook. 

Cracked Wheat. Two quarts salted water to two cups best white 
winter wheat; boil tAvo or three hours in a custard kettle. Or, soak over 
night and boil at least three-fourths of an hour. Or, put boiling water in 
a pan or small tin bucket, set on range, stir in wheat, set in steamer and 
steam four hours. Or, make a strong sack of thick muslin or drilling, 
moisten wheat with cold water, add a little salt, place in sack, leaving 
half the space for wheat to swell in. Fit a round sheet of tin, perforated 
with holes half an inch in diameter, to the inside of ordinary kettle so 
that it will rest two or three inches from the bottom; lay sack on the tin, 
put in water enough to reach tin, and boil from three to four hours, sup- 
plying water as it evaporates. Serve with butter and syrup, or cream 
and sugar. When cold, slice and fry on a Majestic Range; or warm with 
a little milk and salt in a pan greased with a little butter; or make in 
griddle-cakes with a batter of eggs, milk, a little flour and pinch of salt. 

Fine White Hominy or Grits. Take two cups to two quarts 
salted water, soak over night, and boil three-quarters of an hour in a cus- 
tard kettle on a Majestic Range. Serve with milk and sugar, or when 
cold slice and fry.

ICING FOR CAKE. 



Boiled Frosting. One pint of granulated sugar with enough 
water to dissolve it. Let it boil on a Majestic Range until it threads from 
the spoon. Beat the whites of two eggs stiff and pour the boiling sugar 
into it, beating all the time. 

Cream Frosting Take the whites of two eggs, add an equal 
measure of cold water, stir into this confectioners' sugar until the right 
consistency to spread. Flavor with one-half teaspoonful extract of 
vanilla. 

The Best Icing. One pound of sugar, whites of three eggs ; beat 
the whites until frothy, not white, add the sugar gradually with one hand 
while you beat with the other. Flavor with extract of lemon or almond. 

Frosting. Whites of two eggs, two cups of pulverized sugar, one- 
half cup corn starch. Beat all together until stiff, and frost the cake 
while hot. 

Soft Icing. Ten teaspoonfuls of sugar to one egg; beat twenty 
minutes. Flavor with extract of rose. 

Almond Icing. Three cups of sugar, one pound of almonds, 
blanched and pounded to a paste ; beat the whites of three eggs and stir 
in the sugar and almonds. Flavor with extract of rose. 

Water Icing. Two cups of sugar, water enough to make a thick 
paste, a small pinch of cream of tartar. Beat well; if not stiff enough, 
add more sugar. Flavor with one-half teaspoonful extract of peach. 

Chocolate Icing. Melt three ounces of chocolate in a little water, 
boil in two cups of sugar, stir in the whites of three well-beaten eggs. 
Flavor with extract of vanilla. 

Orange Cake Frosting. Yolks of three eggs beaten very light 
and made stiff with pulverized sugar, one teaspoonful of orange extract; 
put on the cake while warm. 

Gelatine Icing. Dissolve one tablespoonful gelatine in one-half 
cup boiling water, and strain ; thicken with powdered sugar, and flavor. 

Chocolate Icing. One cup milk; when it comes to a boil, add 
one cup grated chocolate; when chocolate is dissolved, add one and a 
half cups pulverized sugar, the yolks of five eggs ; after it has been taken 
from the stove, add one teaspoonful of vanilla. 

Crystallization. Crystallization consists in simply covering the 
cake while the icing is wet with granulated sugar, plain or pink. Or you 
can use pink or white sugar, or rock candy crushed. If you wish to crys- 
tallize only a portion of the icing, and that in any particular design, first 
allow the icing to dry, then wash the part you wish crystallized with 
white of egg or gum water, and cover it with the sugar ; then shake off 
what will not remain on.

MAJESTIC RANGE COOK BOOK, 

Strawberry Pie. Put a thin, round, ten-inch wide flat of feuil- 
letage on a baking-sheet; wet the edge, then lay on this a rim of the 
sauce-paste a third of an inch thick and an inch wide, and make the ends 
adhere; pick three pints of large and not too ripe strawberries, roll them 
in fresh butter and powdered sugar, put in the centre of the cake in dome 
form, wet the rim. and cover with another thin flat of feuilletage; press

.. hite, besprinkle with white granulated sugar, and bake in a mod- 
erately heated Majestic Kange oven for half an hour without allowing the

DUMPLINGS. 



Apple Dumplings. Make a soft dough; peel and core tart apples; 
wrap each apple in the dough, drop in boiling water; eat with sauce. 

Steamed Apple Dumplings. M-nke a good baking powder crust, 
peel and core tart apples, fill the cavity in apples with sugar, wrap cai-h 
in the dough, and steam one hour on a Majestic Range. Serve with but- 
ter and sugar .sauce. 

Baked Apple Dumplings. Make as for steamed dumplings: 
put in pan so as not to touch; bake brown in a Majestic llange. Serve 
with cream sauce, 

Peach Dumplings. Make the same crust as for apple dumplings. 
Use canned peaches, put a little piece of butter with same and a little 
sugar, cover in dough, and bake in a Majestic Eange. Serve with foam- 
ing sauce. 

Bar Berries. Make a crust as for pie, roll out quite thin and cut 
in rounds with the top of a pint pail, if you are not fortunate enough to 
have a cutter the requisite size. On these rounds pour a good tablespoon- 
ful of this mixture. One cup of stoned and chopped raisins, one piece of 
citron about the size of a trade dollar, the juice and grated rind of one 
lemon, one egg, one cup of sugar, and a pinch of salt; mix all well. 
Alter putting it on the paste, wrap it together, thus making a sort of little 
turn over. Do not cut any vent in the dough, but press the edges so 
firmly together that not a drop can escape. When all are laid side by 
side in a pan or baking tin, wet them over with milk in which a little 
sugar is dissolved; this gives them a lovely brown when baked in a 
Majestic llange. 

Boiled Apple Dumplings. Add to two cups sour milk, one tea- 
spoonful soda, and one of salt, half cup of butter, lard, flour enough to 
make dough a little stiffer than for biscuit: or make a good baking pow- 
der crust; peel and core apples, roll out crust, place apples on dough, fill 
cavity of each with sugar, encase each apple in coating of the crust, press 
edges tight together (it is nice to tie a cloth around each one), put into a 
kettle of boiling water slightly salted, boil half an hour on a Majestic 
Range, taking care that the water covers* the dumplings. They are also 
very nice steamed. To bake, make in the same way, using a soft dough, 
place in a shallow pan, bake in a hotoven, and serve with cream and sugar, 
or place in a pan four or five inches deep (do not have the dumplings 
touch each other) ; then pour in hot water, just leaving top of dumplings 
uncovered. To a pan of four or five dumplings, add one teacupful sugar 
and half a teacupful butter; bake from half to three-quarters of an hour 
in a Majestic Range. If water cooks away too much, add more. Serve 
dumplings on platter and the liquid in sauce-boat for dressing. Fresh or 
canned peaches may be made in the same way.

MEATS. 



Broiled Beefsteak. Lay a thick, tender steak upon a gridiron 
well greased with butter or beef suet, over hot coals ; when done on one 
side have ready the warmed platter with a little butter on it, lay the steak, 
without pressing it, upon the platter with the cooked side down so that 
the juices which have gathered may run on the platter; quickly place it 
again on gridiron and cook the other side. When done to liking, put on 
platter again, spread lightly with butter, season with salt and pepper and 
place where it will keep warm (over boiling steam is best) for a few mo- 
ments, but do not let butter become oily. Serve on hot plates. Many 
prefer to sear on one side, turn immediately and sear the other, and fin- 
ish cooking, turning often; garnish with fried sliced potatoes, or with 
browned potato balls the size of a marble, piled at each end of platter. 
Broil on a Majestic Broiler. 

Fried Beefsteak. When the means to broil are not at hand, the 
next best method is to heat the % frying pan very hot, put in steak pre- 
viously hacked, let remain a few* moments, loosen with knife and turn 
quickly several times ; repeat this, and when done transfer to a hot plat- 
ter, salt, pepper, and put over it bits of butter; pile the steaks one on top 
of another, and cover with a hot platter. This way of frying is both 
healthful and delicate. Or, heat the skillet, trim off the fat from the 
steak, cut in small bits and set on to fry on a Majestic Range; meanwhile 
pound steak, then draw the bits of suet to one side and put in the steak, 
turn quickly over several times so as to sear the outside, take out on a hot 
platter previously prepared with salt and pepper, dredge well, return to 
skillet, repeating the operation until the steak is done; dish on a hot 
platter, covering with another platter, and place where it will keep hot 
while making the gravy. Place a tablespoon dry flour in the skillet, be- 
ing sure to have the fat boiling hot, stir until brown and free from lumps 
(the bits of suet may be left in, drawing them to one side until the flour is 
browned), pour in about half a pint boiling water (milk or cream is bet- 
ter), stir well, season with pepper and salt, and serve in a gravy tureen. 
Spread bits of butter over steak and send to table at once. This is more 
economical, but not so wholesome as broiling. 

Beefsteak Smothered in Onions. Slice the onions thin and 
drop in cold water; put steak in pan with a little suet. Skim out onions 
and add to steak, season with pepper and salt, cover tightly and put over 
the fire. When the juice of the onions has dried up and the meat has 
browned on one side, remove onions, turn steak, replace onions and fry 
on a Majestic Range till done, being careful not to burn. 

Boiled Corned Beef. Soak over night if very salt, but if beef is 
young and properly corned this is not necessary; pour over it cold water 
enough to cover it well, after washing off the salt. The rule for boiling 
meats is twenty-five minutes to a pound, but corned beef should be placed 

" MAJESTIC "IN ENDURANCE" MAJESTIC." 



63 MAJESTIC RANGE COOK BOOK. 

on a part of the range where it will simmer, not boil, uninterruptedly 
from four to six hours, according to the size of the piece. If to be served 
cold, some let the meat remain in the liquor until cold, and some let 
tough beef remain in the liquor until the next day, and bring it to the 
boiling point just before serving. Simmer a brisket or plate-piece until 
the bones are easily removed, fold over, forming a square or oblong piece, 
place sufficient weight on top to press the parts closely together and set 
where it will become cold. This gives a firm, solid piece to cut in slices 
and is a delightful relish. Boil liquor down, remove the fat, season with 
pepper or sweet herbs and save it to pour over finely minced scraps and 
pieces of beef; press the meat firmly into a mold, pour over it the liquor, 
and place over it a close cover with a weight upon it. When turned from 
the mold garnish with sprigs of parsley or celery, and serve with fancy 
pickles or French mustard. Cook on a Majestic Range. 

Beef a la Mode. In a piece of the rump cut deep openings with a 
sharp knife; put in pieces of pork cut into dice, previously rolled in pep- 
per, salt, cloves and nutmeg. Into an iron stewpan lay pieces of pork, 
sliced onions, slices of lemon, one or two carrots and a bay leaf; lay the 
meat on and put over it a piece of bread crust as large as the hand, a half 
pint wine and a little vinegar, and afterwarde an equal quantity of water 
or broth, till the meat is half covered; cover the dish close and cook till 
tender. Then take it out, rub the gravy thoroughly through a sieve, 
skim off the fat, add some sour cream, return to the stewpan and cook ten 
minutes on a Majestic Range. Instead of the cream, capers or sliced cu- 
cumber pickles can be added to the gravy if preferred, or a handful of 
f rated ginger bread or rye bread. The meat can also be laid for some 
ays before in a spiced vinegar or wine pickle. 

Roast Beef. Take a rib piece or loin roast of seven to eight 
pounds. Beat it thoroughly all over, lay it in the roasting dish and baste 
it with melted butter. Put it inside the well-heated Majestic Range 
oven, and baste frequently with its own fat, which will make it brown 
and tender. If, when it is cooking fast the gravy is growing too brown, 
turn a glass of German cooking wine into the bottom of the pan, and re- 
peat this as often as the gravy cooks away. The roast needs about two 
hours time to be done, and must be bro\vn outside, but inside still a little 
red. Season with salt and pepper. Squeeze a little lemon juice over it, and 
also turn the gravy upon it, after skimming off all fat. 

Stewed Beef. Take a piece of the rump, pound it till tender, lay 
in an iron vessel previously lined with slices of pork and onions, with a 
few pepper-corns, dredge it with salt, and baste with melted butter. 
Cover close over a good heat, and when it has fried a nice brown add one 
pint German cooking wine and as much more good soup stock and stew it 
till soft on a Majestic Range. Before serving, take out the meat, skim off 
the fat, add a tablespoon of flour mixed smooth with broth, add gradu- 
ally still more broth, strain it through a sieve and turn over the pre- 
viously dished meat. The meat can be laid for some days before in vine- 
gar or in a spiced pickle, or be basted with either occasionally instead of 
lying in it.

MAJESTIC RANGE COOK BOOK. 59 

A Brown Stew. Put on range a rather thick piece of beef with 
little bone and some fat; four hours before needed pour on just boiling 
\vater enough to cover; cover with a close fitting lid, boil gently, and as 
the water boils away add only just enough from time to time to keep from 
burning, so that when the meat is tender the water may all be boiled 
away, as the fat will allow the meat to brown Avithout burning; turn oc- 
casionally, brown evenly over a slow fire in a Majestic Kange, and make 
a gravy by stirring Hour and water together and adding to the drippings; 
season with salt an hour before it is done. 

Fried Liver. Cut in thin slices and place on a platter, pour on 
boiling water and immediately pour it off (this seals the outside, takes 
away the iinpleasant flavor and makes it much more palatable) ; have 
ready in skillet on the range some hot lard or beef drippings, or both to- 

f ether, dredge the liver with rolled crackers or dried bread crumbs rolled 
ne and nicely seasoned with pepper and salt, put in skillet, placing the 
tin cover on, fry slowly until both sides are dark brown, when the liver 
will be thoroughly cooked. The time required is about a quarter of an 
hour on a Majestic Kange. 

Boiled Mutton with Caper Sauce. Have ready a pot of boil- 
ing water and throw in a handful of salt ; wash a leg of mutton and rub 
salt through it. If it is to be rare, cook about two hours; if well done, 
three hours or longer, according to size. Boil a pint of milk, thicken 
with flour well blended, add butter, salt, pepper and two tablespoons of 
capers, or mint sauce if preferred. 

Lamb Stewed with Peas. Cut the neck or breast in pieces, put 
it in a stewpan with some salt pork sliced thin and enough water to cover 
it; cover close and let stew on a Majestic Range until the meat is tender, 
then skim free from scum, add a quart of green peas shelled, and more 
hot water if nece>.-ary ; cover till the peas are done tender, then add a bit 
of butter rolled in flour, and pepper to taste; let simmer for a few min- 
utes and serve. 

Mutton Chops. Season with salt and pepper, put in skillet, cover 
closely and fry five minutes, turning over once ; dip each chop in beaten 
egg, then in cracker or bread crumbs, and fry till tender or nicely 
browned on each side; or put in oven in a dripping pan with a little 
water, salt and pepper; baste frequently and bake in a Majestic Range 
until brown. To broil lamb chops, trim neatly, broil over a clear fire, 
with a Majestic Broiler, season with pepper and salt, and serve with 
green peas. 

Fried Salt Pork. Cut in rather thin slices, and freshen by letting 
lie an hour or two in cold water, or milk and water, roll in flour and fry 
till crisp (if in a hurry pour boiling water on the slices, let stand a few 
minutes, drain, roll in flour and fry as before) ; drain off most of the grease 
from frying pan, stir in while hot one or two tablespoons of flour, half a 
pint new milk, a little pepper, and salt, if not salt enough already from 
the meat; let boil and pour into gravy dish. This makes a nice white 
gravy when properly made. Cook on a Majestic Range.

Fried Porksteaks. Fry like beefsteaks, with pepper and salt, or 
sprinkle with dry powdered sage if the sausage flavor is liked. Fry on a 
Majestic Range. 

Roast Pork. A small loin of pork, three tablespoons bread 
crumbs, one onion, half a teaspoon chopped sage, half teaspoon salt, half 
teaspoon pepper, one oiiHce chopped suet, one tablespoon drippings. 
Separate each joint of the loin with the chopper, and then make an inci- 
sion with a knife into the thick part of the pork in which to put the stuf- 
fing. Prepare the stuffing by mixing the bread crumbs together with the 
onion, which must have previously been finely chopped. Add to this the 
sage, pepper, salt and suet, and when all is thoroughly mixed press the 
mixture snugly into the incision already made in the pork, and sew to- 
gether the edges of the meat with needle and thread, to confine the stuf- 
fing. Grease well a sheet of kitchen paper with drippings, place the loin 
into this, securing it with a wrapping of twine. Put to bake in a dry 
baking pan in a brisk Majestic Range oven, basting immediately and con- 
stantly as the grease draws out, and roast a length of time, allowing 
twenty minutes to the pound and twenty minutes longer. Serve with 
apple sauce or apple fritters. 

Veal Loaf. Chop fine three pounds of leg or loin of veal and 
three -fourths pound salt pork, chopped finely together; roll one dozen 
crackers, put half of them in the veal with two eggs, season with pepper 
and a little salt if needed; mix all together and make into a solid form; 
then take the crackers that are left and spread smoothly over the outside ; 
bake in a Majestic Range one hour, and eat cold. 

Veal or Chicken Pot-Pie. Put two or three pounds veal (a 
piece with ribs is good) cut in a dozen pieces in a quart of cold water; 
make a quart of soda biscuit dough, take two-thirds of dough, roll to a 
fourth of an inch thick, cut in strips one inch wide by three long; pare 
and slice six potatoes; boil veal till tender, take out all but three or four 
pieces, put in two handfuls of potatoes and several strips of dough, then 
add pieces of veal and dough, seasoning with salt, pepper, and a little 
butter, until all the veal is in the pot; add boiling water enough to cover, 
take rest of dough, roll out to size of pot, cut several holes to let steam 
escape, and place over the whole. Put on a tight lid and boil gently on 
a Majestic Range twenty or thirty minutes without uncovering. 

A Pot Roast. Take a nice brisket of beef, weighing about four 
pounds, trim off rough parts; place it in a kettle, over a good fire, on a 
.Majestic Range; bro\vn one side, then turn and brown on the other; then 
add one pint of boiling water; cover and cook slowly one hour. Adda 
teaspoonf ul of salt when the meat is half done. After the water evapo- 
rates add no more, as there should be sufficient fat to finish cooking the 
meat. When the meat is done place it on a heated dish. Drain all the 
fat but two tablespoonfuls from the pot, and puf it away for frying. To 
the two tablespoonfuls in the pot add the same quantity of flour. Mix 
well, and add one pint of water; stir until it boils; season, and pour 
around the meat.

Boned Ham. Having soaked a well-cured ham in tepid water 
over night, boil it till perfectly tender on a Majestic Range, putting it on 
in warm water; take up in a wooden tray, let cool, remove bone carefully, 
press the ham again into shape, return to boiling liquor, remove pot from 
fire and let the ham remain in it till cool. Cut across and serve cold. 

Boiled Ham. Pour boiling water over it and let stand until cool 
enough to wash ; scrape clean (some have a coarse hair brush on purpose 
>for cleaning hams), put in a thoroughly cleansed boiler with cold water 
enough to cover; bring to the boiling point and then place on back part 
of range to simmer steadily for six or seven hours, or till tender when 
pierced with a fork (if the ham weighs twelve pounds) ; be careful to 
keep water at boiling point, and not to allow it to go much above it. 
Turn the ham once or twice in the water; when done take up and put 
into a baking pan to skin; dip the hands in cold water, take the skin be- 
tween the lingers and peel as you would an orange ; set in a moderate 
oven, placing the lean side of the ham downward, and if you like sift 
over pounded or rolled crackers. Bake one hour in a Majestic Range. 
The baking brings out a great quantity of fat, leaving the meat much 
more delicate, and in warm weather it will keep in a dry, cool place a 
long time ; if there is a tendency to mold set it a little while into the oven 
again. Or, after the ham is boiled and peeled cover with the white of a 
raw egg, and sprinkle sugar or fine bread crumbs over it; or cover with a 
regular cake-icing, place in the oven and brown ; or, quarter two onions, 
stick whole allspice and black pepper in the quarters, with a knife make 
slits in the outside of the ham in which put the onions, place in dripping 
pan, lay parsley around and bake till nicely browned. Or, after boiling 
and peeling dust with sugar and pass a hot knife over it until it forms a 
caramel glaze, and serve without baking. A still nicer way is to glaze 
with strong meat jelly or any savory jelly at hand, boiled down rapidly 
, (taking great care to prevent burning) until it is like glue. Brush this 
jelly over the ham when cool and it makes an elegant dish. The nicest 
portion of a boiled ham may be served in slices, and the ragged parts and 
odds and ends chopped fine for sandwiches, or by adding three eggs to 
one pint of chopped ham a delicious omelet may be made. If the ham is 
very salt it should lie in water over night. 

Broiled Ham. Cut the ham in slices of medium thickness, place 

on a hot gridiron and broil on a Majestic Broiler until the fat readily 

flows out and the meat is slightly browned; take from the gridiron with a 

knife and fork, drop into a pan of cold water, then return to the gridiron, 

- repeat several times, and the ham is done; place in a hot platter, add a 

few lumps of butter, and serve at once. If too fat trim off a part; it is al- 

' most impossible to broil the fat part without burning, but this does not 

impair the taste. Pickled pork and breakfast bacon may be broiled in 

the same way. 

Delicious Fried Ham. Place the slices in boiling water and 
cook till tender; put in frying pan and brown on a Majestic Range, and 
dish on a platter; fry some eggs by dripping gravy over them until done 
instead of turning; take up carefully and lay them on the slices of ham.

Fried Veal Cutlets. Make a batter of half pint of milk, a well- 
beaten egg, and flour; fry the veal brown in sweet lard or beef drippings, 
dip it in the batter and fry again till brown ; drop some spoonfuls of bat- 
ter in the hot lard after the veal is taken up, and serve them on top of the 
meat; put a little flour paste in the gravy with salt and pepper, let it 
come to a boil and pour it over the whole. The veal should be cut thin, 
pounded, and cooked nearly an hour in a Majestic Range. Cracker 
crumbs and eggs may be used instead of batter, but the skillet should 
then be kept covered, and the veal cooked slowly for half an hour over a 
moderate fire. If a gravy is wanted sprinkle a little flour in the pan, add 
salt and pepper and a little water, let come to a boil, and pour over the 
cutlets; or, pound well, squeeze juice of lemon over the slices, let stand 
an hour or two, dip in beaten egg and then in fine bread crumbs (if no 
stale bread is at hand dry slices in a cool oven), plunge at once into hot fat 
enough to cover. The slices will brown before they are thoroughly 
cooked, and the pan should be drawn aside to a cooler place to "finish " 
more slowly. 

Fish may be fried in the same way ; when done the meat will separate 
readily from the bone when a knife is inserted. They may be dipped in 
milk and then in flour, instead of in eggs and bread crumbs; sift salt 
evenly over the meat or flsh just before serving. The bread crumbs 
should be fine ; if coarse, they crumble off with the egg in cooking. 

Roast Spare-Rib. Trim off the rough ends neatly, crack the ribs 
across the middle, rub with salt and sprinkle with pepper, fold over, stuff 
with turkey-dressing, sew up tightly, place in dripping pan with pint 
water, baste frequently, turning over once so as to bake both sides equally 
Bake in a Majestic Range until a rich brown . 

Yankee Pork and Beans. Pick over carefully a quart of bear 
and let them soak over night; in the morning wash and dram in another 
water, put on to boil in cold water with half a teaspoon of soda- boil 
about thirty minutes (when done the skin of a bean will crack if taker 
out and blown upon), drain, and put in an earthen pot first a slice of port 
and then the beans, with two or three tablespoons of molasses. Whei 
the beans are in the pot put in the center half or three-fourths of a pounc 
of well-washed salt pork with the rind scored in slices or squares, and 
uppermost, season with pepper and salt if needed; coverall with he 
water, and bake six hours or longer in a moderate oven in a Majestic 
Range, adding hot water as needed; they can not be baked too 
Keep covered so that they will not burn on the top, but remove cover 
hour or two before serving, to brown the top and crisp the pork. This , 
the Yankee dish for Sunday breakfast. It is often baked the day before 
allowed to remain in the oven all night, and browned in the mornin< 
Serve in the dish in which they are cooked, and always have enough lei 
to know the luxury of cold beans, or baked beans warmed over. If sal 
pork is too robust for the appetites to be served, season delicately wit 
salt, pepper, and a little butter, and roast a fresh spare-rib to serve wit 
them.

POULTRY. 



Baked Chickens. Dress the chickens and cut them in two, soak 
for half an hour in cold water, wipe perfectly dry and put in a dripping- 
pan, bone side down, without any water; have a hot oven, and, if the 
i-hirkens are young, half an hour's cooking in a Majestic Range will be 
sufik-ient. Take out, and season with butter, salt and pepper; pack one 
above another as closely as possible, and place in a pan over boiling water, 
covering them closely this keeps them moist until served boil the gib- 
lets in a little water, and, after the chickens are taken from the dripping- 
pan, put into it the water in which giblets were boiled, thicken it, and 
add the chopped giblets. This manner of baking chickens is fully equal 
to broiling them. 

Baked Spring Chickens. Cut each of four chickens into seven 
or nine pieces, wash thoroughly and quickly, and put in a colander to 
drain, put a half tablespoon each of lard and butter into a dripping-pan, 
lay in the pieces, and add half a pint hot water; place in Majestic Range 
oven and bake half an hour, turn, taking care that they get only to a light 
brown, and, just before taking up, add salt and pepper to taste; when 
done, take out in a dish and keep hot. To make the gravy, add a half 
pint or more of water, set the dripping-pan on the range, and add one 
tablespoon flour mixed with half cup of cream or milk, stirring slowly, 
adding a little of the mixture at a time, Let cook thoroughly, stirring 
constantly to prevent burning, and to make the gravy nice and smooth ; 
season more if necessary. 

Baked Chicken with Parsnips. Wash, scrape and quarter 
parsnips, and parboil for twenty minutes ; prepare a young chicken by 
splitting open at back, place in a dripping-pan, skin side up, lay parsnips 
around the chicken, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and add a lump of 
butter the size of an egg, or two or three slices of good pickled pork; 
put enough water in pan to prevent burning, place in Majestic Range oven 
and bake until chickens and parsnips are done to a delicate brown; serve 
chicken separately on a platter, pouring the gravy in the pan over the 
parsnips. 

Chicken Croquettes. Boil two fowls weighing five pounds each 
till very tender, mince fine, add one pint cream, half pound butter, salt 
and pepper to taste; shape oval in a jelly glass or mold. Fry in lard like 
doughnuts until brown on a Majestic Range. 

Breaded Chicken. Cut a tender chicken into seven pieces, as if 
for frying, roll in beaten yolks of two eggs, then in finely grated bread 
crumbs, seasoned with chopped parsley, pepper and salt; place in dripping- 
pan, dot the pieces with bits of butter (one tablespoon in all), add a little 
water, bake slowly in a Majestic Range, basting often. When done, take 
out chicken and make gravy in the pan by adding a mixture of flour and 
butter, make smooth by stirring. Add either cream or milk to make 
sufficient gravy, which season to taste.

Broiled Chickens or Quails. Cut a chicken open on the back, 
lay on the meat-board and pound until it will lie flat, place on Majestic 
Broiler and broil until a nice brown, but do not burn. It will take twenty 
or thirty minutes to cook thoroughly, and it will cook much better to 




tender, chop line and add flour, butter, pepper, salt, and stir a cup of 
sweet cream to the water in which they were boiled ; when the chicken is 
done, dip in this gravy while hot. lay it back on the broiler a minute, put 
it in the gravy and let boil for hall a minute, and send to the table hot. 
Cook quails in the same way. 

Dressing for Chicken or Beef .Boil potatoes, mash as if for 
the table, except that they should be less moist, stuff the chicken or roast 
with this, and bake as ordinarily in a Majestic Range; for ducks, add onions 
chopped fine ; if the bread-dressing is wanted too, it may be laid in the 
corner of the pan. 

Fricasseed Chicken. Cut up and put on to boil, skin side down, 
on a Majestic Range in a small quantity of water, season with salt, pep- 
per, and slices of an onion if liked; stew gently until tender, remove 
chicken, add a half pint of cream or milk to gravy, and thicken with 
butter and flour rubbed smoothly together (adding a little of the gravy 
to soften and help mix them), let boil two or three minutes, add a little 
chopped parsley, and serve. Or, first fry the chicken brown in a little 
hot lard on a Majestic Range, take out chicken, add a tablespoon flour, 
and let cook a minute, stirring constantly; add a pint of water (or stock, 
if at hand), a little vinegar or Worcestershire sauce, season with salt and 
pepper; when it has boiled, remove from fire, strain, add the beaten yolk 
of an egg, pour over the chicken and serve. Or, put chicken in sauce- 
pan with barely enough water to cover, stew gently until tender; have a 
frying-pan prepared with a few slices of salt pork, drain chicken, and fry 
with pork on a Majestic Range until it is a fine, rich brown; take chicken 
and bits of pork from the pan, pour in the broth, thicken with brown flour, 
mixed smooth with a little water, and season with pepper; now put chicken 
and pork back into gravy, let simmer a few minutes, and serve very hot. 

English Roast Turkey. Kill several days before cooking, pre- 
pare in the usual manner, stuff with bread-crumbs (not using the crusts) 
rubbed fine, moistened with butter and two eggs, seasoned with salt, pep- 
per, parsley, sage, thyme or sweet marjoram ; sew up, skewer, and place 
to roast in a rack within a dripping-pan in a Majestic Range; spread with 
bits of butter, turn and baste frequently with butter, pepper, salt and 
water; a few minutes before it is done glaze with the white of an egg; 
dish the turkey, pour off most of the fat, add the chopped giblets and the 
water in which they were boiled, thicken with flour and butter rubbed to- 

f ether, stir in the dripping-pan, let boil thoroughly and serve in a gravy- 
oat. Garnish with fried oysters, and serve with celery sauce and stewed 
gooseberries. Choose a turkey weighing from eight to ten pounds. If it 
ecomes too brown, cover with buttered paper.

Chickens for Lunch. Split a young chicken down the back, 
wash and wipe dry, season with salt and pepper. Put in a dripping-pan, 
and place in a moderate Majestic Range oven; bake three-quarters of an 
hour, This is much better for traveling lunch than when seasoned with 
butter. 

Chicken Pot-pie. Cut up a chicken and place on a Majestic Range 
in hot water enough to cover, and take care that it does not cook dry; 
while boiling cut off a slice from bread dough, add a small lump of lard, 
and mix up like light biscuit, roll, cut out with cake-cutter, and set by 
range to rise ; wash and pare potatoes of moderate size, and add them 
when chicken is almost done; when potatoes begin to boil, season with 
salt and pepper, add dumplings and season again. See that there is 
water enough to keep from burning, cover very tightly, and do not take 
cover off until dumplings are done. They will cook in half an hour, 
and may be tested by lifting one edge of the lid, taking out a dumpling, 
and breaking it open. Or the dumplings may be placed in steamer over 
cold water, taking care to leave some of the holes in steamer open as, if 
all are covered by the dumplings, the steam will not be admitted, and 
they will not cook well. If there are too many dumplings to lie on bot- 
tom without covering all holes, attach them to the side and upper edge of 
steamer by wetting dough and pressing it to the edge. When done, re- 
move to vegetable dish and pour hot gravy over them. Dish potatoes by 
themselves, and chickens and dumplings together. Make gravy by mix- 
Ing two level tablespoons flour and a little butter together, and stir into 
the broth remaining in pot slowly, add more boiling water if needed, and 
season with salt and pepper. Or, make dumplings with one pint sour 
milk, two well-beaten eggs, half teaspoon soda (mixed iu part of the 
flour), and Hour enough to make as stiff as can be stirred with a spoon; 
or baking powder and sweet milk may be used. Drop in by spoonfuls, 
cover tightly, and boil on a Majestic Range, as above. A pot-pie may be 
made from a good boiling piece of beef ; if too much grease arises, skim off. 

Chicken Pie. Cut up two young chickens, place on a Majestic 
Range in hot water enough to cover (as it boils away add more, so as to 
have enough for the pie and for gravy to serve with it), boil until tender; 
line the sides of a four of six quart pan with a rich baking powder or soda 
biscuit dough quarter of an inch thick, put in part of the chicken, season 
with salt, pepper and butter, lay in a few thiu strips or squares of dough, 
add the rest of chicken and season as before ; some add five or six fresh 
eggs, or a few new potatoes in their season; season liquor in which the 
chickens are boiled with butter, salt and pepper, add a part of it to the 
pie, cover with crust a quarter of an inch thick with a hole in the center 
the size of a tea cup. Keep adding the chicken liquor as needed, since 
the fault of most chicken pies is that they are too dry. There can scarcely 
be too much gravy. Bake one hour in a moderate oven. 

Veal pies are similarly made, omitting eggs, and using two or three 
pounds veal to a quart of dough. Add to the liquor left in pot a table- 
spoon of butter mixed with flour to a paste, season with pepper and salt 
for gravy, adding water if needed.

GAME. 



Quail on Toast. Dry-pick them, singe them with paper, cut off 
heads, and legs at first joint, draw, split down the back, soak in salt and 
water for five or ten minutes, drain and dry with a cloth, lard them with 
bacon or butter and rub salt over them, place on Majestic Broiler and 
turn often, dipping two or three times into melted butter; broil about 
twenty minutes. Have ready as many slices of buttered toast as there are 
birds, and serve a bird, breast upward, on each slice. 

Broiled Pheasant or Prairie Chicken. Scald and skin, cut 
off the breast and cut the rest up in joints, being careful to remove all 
shot; put in hot water all except the breast (which will be tender enough 
without parboiling), and boil until it can be pierced with fork; take out, 
rub over salt, pepper and butter, and broil with breast over brisk fire on a 
Majestic Broiler; place a lump of butter on each piece and set all in the 
oven a few minutes. For breakfast serve on fried mush; for dinner, on 
toast with a bit of currant jelly over each piece. It may be served with 
toast cut in pieces about two inches square, over which pour gravy made 
by thickening the liquor in which the birds were boiled, with a little but- 
ter and flour rubbed together and stirred in while boiling. Squirrels may 
be prepared the same way. 

Broiled Quail. Split through the back and broil over a hot fire 
on a Majestic Broiler, basting frequently with butter. When done place 
a bit of butter on each piece and set in a Majestic Eange oven a few mo- 
ments to brown. Serve on pieces of toast with currant jelly. Plovers are 
cooked in the same way. Pigeons should be first parboiled and then 
broiled. 

Prairie Chickens. Cut out all shot, wash thoroughly but quickly, 
using some soda in the water, rinse and dry. fill with dressing, sew up 
with cotton thread, and tie down the legs and wings: place in a steamer 
over hot water till done, remove to a dripping pan, cover with butter, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, place in a Majestio 
Range oven and baste with the melted butter until a nice brown. Serve 
with either apple sauce, cranberries or currant jelh*. 

Roast Duck. Ducks are dressed and stuffed in the same manner 
as above. Young ducks should roast from twenty-five to thirty minutes; 
full-grown for an hour or more with frequent basting. Some prefer them 
underdone, served very hot. but thorough cooking will prove more gen- 
erally palatable. Serve with currant jelly, apple sauce and green peas. 
If old. parboil before roasting. 

Place the remains of a cold roast duck in a stew pan with a pint of 
gravy and a little sage, cover closely and let it simmer for half an hour on 
a Majestic Range; add a pint of boiled green peas, stew a few minutes, 
remove to a dish, and pour over it the gravy and |

Roast Quails. Pluck and dress like chickens, wipe clean, and rub 
both inside and out with salt and pepper; stuff with any good dressing 
and se\v up with tine thread: spread with butter and place in a Majestic 
Range oven with a good steady heat, turning and basting often with hot 
w.ajter seasoned with butter, salt and pepper; bake three-quarters of an 
hour. AVhen about half done add a little hot water to the pan, and it is 
well to place a dripping pan over them to prevent browning too much. 
Add to the gravy Hour and butter rubbed together, and water if needed. 

Roast Goose. The goose should not be more than eight months 
old, and the fatter the more tender and juicy the meat. A ''green" 
(four mouths old) is the choicest. Kill at least twenty-four hours 
before cooking: cut the neck close to the back, beat the breast-bone flat 
with a rolling pin. tie the wings and legs securely, and stuff with the fol- 
lowing mixture : Three pints bread crumbs, six ounces butter, or part 
butter and part salt pork, two chopped onions, one teaspoon each of sage, 
black pepper and salt. Do not stuff very full, and stitch openings firmly 
together to keep flavor in and fat out. If the goose is not fat, lard it with 
salt pork, or tie a slice on the breast. Place in a baking pan with- a little 
water, and baste frequently with salt and water (some add onion and 
some vinegar), turning often so that the sides and back may all be nicely 
browned. " When nearly done baste with butter and a little flour. Bake 
in a Majestic Range two hours or more if old. When done take from the 
pan. pour off the fat. and to the brown gravy left add the chopped giblets 
which have previously been stowed till tender, together with the water 
they we'-e boiled in; thicken with a little flour and butter rubbed to- 
gether, bring to a boil, and serve with currant jelly. Apple sauce and 
onion sauce are proper accompaniments to roast goose. 

Reed Birds. Roasting by suspending on the little wire which ac- 
companies the roaster is the best method ; turn and baste frequently, or 
wash and peel with as thin a paring as possible large potatoes of equal 
size, cut a deep slice off one end of each and scoop out a part of the^po- 
tato; drop a piece of butter into each bird, pepper and salt, and put it in 
the hollows made in the potatoes; put on as covers the pieces cut off. and 
clip the other end for them to stand on. Set in a baking pan upright 
with a little water to prevent burning, bake slowly in a Majestic Range. 
and serve in the dish in which they are baked. Or, boil in a crust like 
dumplings. 

Rabbits. Rabbits, which are in the best condition in mid-winter, 

be fricasseed like chicken in white or brown sauce. To make a pie, 

first stew till tender and make like chicken pie. To roast, stuff with a 

dressing made of bread crumbs, chopped salt pork, thyme, onion, and 

per and salt; sew up, rub over with a little butter, or pin on it a few 

-alt pork, add a little water in the pan, and baste often. Serve 

with mashed potatoes and currant jelly. Bake ia a Majestic Range. 

Snipe- Snipe are best roasted with a piece of pork tied to the breast, 
or they may be stuffed and baked in a Majestic Range.

FISH. 



Baked Fish. Clean, rinse, and wipe dry a white fish, or any fish 
weighing three or four pounds, rub the fish inside and out with salt and 
">epper. fiU with a stuffing made like that for poultry but drier; sew it up 
and put in% hot pan with some drippings and a lump of butter, dredge 
with Hour, and lay over the fish a few thin slices of salt pork or bits of 
butter; bake an hour and a half in a Majestic Range, basting occasionally. 

Baked Shad. Open and clean the fish, cut off head (or not as pre- 
ferred) cut out the backbone from the head to within two inches of the 
tail and fill with the following mixture : Soak stale bread in water, 
squeeze dry; cut a large onion in pieces, fry in butter, chop fine, add the 
bread, two ounces of butter, salt, pepper, and a little parsley or sage; 
heat thoroughly, and when taken from the fire add two yolks of well- 
beaten eggs; stuff, and, when full, wind the fish several times with tape, 
place in baking pan in a Majestic Range, baste slightly with butter, and 
cover the bottom of pan with water. Serve with the following sauce : 

Sauce. Reduce the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs to a smooth past 
add two tablespoons olive oil, half teaspoon mustard, and pepper an 
vinegar to taste. 

Baked Salmon, Trout or Pickerel. Clean thoroughly, wipe 
carefully, and lay in a dripping pan with hot water enough to prevent 
scorching (a perforated tin sheet or rack fitting loosely in the pan, or 
several muffin rings may be used to keep the fish from the bottom of the 
pan, and the fish may be made to form a circle by tying head and tail to- 
gether) ; bake slowly in a Majestic Range, basting often with butter and 
w;iu-r. When done have ready a cup of sweet cream into which a few 
spoons of hot water have been poured, stir in two tablespoons melted 
butter and a little chopped parsley, and heat in a vessel of boiling water; 
add the gravy from the dish and boil up once. Place the fish in a hot 
dish and pour over the sauce. 

Codfish a la Mode. Teacup codfish picked up fine, two cups 
mashed potatoes, one pint cream or milk, two eggs well beaten, half tea- 
cup butter, salt and pepper; mix well, bake in baking dish from twenty 
to twenty-five minutes in a Majestic Range. 

Boiled Fish. To boil a fish fill with a rich dressing of rolled 
crackers seasoned with butter, pepper, salt and sage, wrap it in a well- 
floured cloth, tie closely with twine or sew, and place in well-salted boil- 
ing water. Place where it will simmer from eight to ten minutes to the 
pound, on a Majestic Range, according to size and thickness of fish. 

Boiled Salt Mackerel. After freshening wrap in a cloth and 
simmer for fifteen minutes on a Majestic Range; it will be almost done as 
soon as the water reaches the boiling point; remove, lay on it two hard- 
boiled eggs sliced, pour over it drawn butter and trim with parsley 
leaves. Boiling salt fish hardens it.

Boiled White Fish. Dress the fish nicely and cover in fish kettle 
with boilino- water seasoned well with salt; remove the scum as it 
and simmer, allowing from eight to ten minutes time to every pound ; 
when about half done add a little vinegar or lemon juice, take out, drain, 
and dish carefully, pouring over it drawn butter; or garnish with sprigs 
of parsley, and .serve with egg sauce. Cook on a Majestic Range. 

Broiled White Fish. Clean, split down the back, and let stand 
insulted water for several hours: wipe dry and place on agyrell-g] 

fridiron over hot coals, sprinkling with salt and pepper. Tut flesh side 
own at first, and when nicely browned turn carefully on the other. 
Cook on a Majestic Range for twenty or thirty minutes, or until nicely 
browned on both sides. 

Brook Trout. Wash and drain in a colander a few minute 
nearly to the tail, flour nicely and put in pan, which should be hot but 
not burning; throw in a little .salt to prevent sticking, and do not turn 
until brown enough for the table. Trout are nice fried with slices of salt 
pork. Cook on a majestic Range. 

Codfish Balls. Soak codfish cut in pieces about an hour in luke- 
warm water, remove skin and bones, pick to small pieces and return to 
range in cold water. As soon as it begins to boil change the water and 
brino- to a boil again. Have ready potatoes boiled tender, well mashed 
and seasoned with butter. Mix thoroughly with the potatoes half the 
quantity of codfish while both are still hot, form into flat, thick cakes or 
round balls, fry in hot lard or drippings on a Majestic Range, or dip in 
hot fat like doughnuts. The addition of a beaten egg before making into 
balls renders them lighter. Cold potatoes may be used by reheating, 
adding a little cream and butter and mixing while hot. 

Fried Fish. Clean thoroughly, cut off the head, and. if large, cut 
out the backbone, and slice the body" crosswise into five or six pieces: dip 
in Indian meal or wheat flour, or in a beaten egg, and then in Dread 
crumbs (trout and perch should never be dipped in meal), put into a 
thick-bottomed skillet, skin side uppermost, with hot lard or drii 
fry slowly on a Majestic Range and turn when a light brown. The roe and 
the backbone if previously removed may be cut up and fried with i br- 
other pieces. A better way is to dredge the pieces in the llonr. 
with beaten egg, roll in bread crumbs and fry in hot lard or drippings 
enough to completely cover them. If the fat is very hot the fish will not 
absorb it and will be delicately cooked. When brown on one side turn 
over in the fat and brown the other, and when done let them drain. 
,Sli.-cs of large fish may be cooked in the same way. Serve with tomato 
sauce or slices of lemon. 

Pan-Fish. Place in pan with heads together and fill spaces with 
smaller fish ; when ready to turn put a plate over, drain off fat, invert 
pan. and the fish will be left unbroken on the plate. Put the lard back in 
the pan. and when hot slip back the fish, and when the other side ii 
brown drain, turn on plate as before, and slide them on the platter to go 
to the table. Cook on a Majestic Range.

the salt, pepper, and flour if any is used, and lastly the whites beaten to a 
stiff froth. Have the skillet as hot as it can be without scorching the 
butter; put in a tablespoon of butter and pour in the omelet, which .should 
at once begin to bubble and rise in flakes. Slip under it a thin, broad- 
bladed knife, and every now and then raise it up to prevent burning. As 
soon as the under side is hard enough to hold together, and the eggs be- 
gin to set." fold over, shake the skillet so as to entirely free the omelet, 
ran -fully slide it on a hot platter and serve at once. It should be cooked 
in from three to five minutes. To bake an omelet place in the frying-pan 
on top of range until it begins to "set" in the middle, then place in a 
rather hot Majestic Range oven; when slightly browned, fold if you like, 
or turn a hot dish on top of the pan, upset the latter with a quick motion, 
and so dish the omelet with the under side uppermost. It should be 
baked in from five to ten minutes. Where a large quantity of eggs art- 
used, instead of making into one large omelet, divide and make several, 
sending each to the table as soon as done. Three eggs make a good-sized 
oineletT Ham. chicken and all kinds of meat omelets are made by chop- 
ping the meat fine and placing between the folds before dishing. In 
making vegetable (asparagus, tomatoes, cauliflower, etc.) omelets cook 
the vegetables as if for the table; place them in the center of the omelet 
just before folding. 

For a plain, easily-made omelet take three tablespoons milk and a 
pinch of salt for each egg; beat the eggs lightly for three or four minutes, 
pour them into a hot pan in which a piece of butter the size of a walnut 
has just been melted, cook three or four minutes, fold over and serve at 
once. Some scald a little parsley, pour off the water, chop it. and mix 
with the omelet just before pouring into the pan. Old cheese grated and 
added to a plain omelet is a favorite dish. To make a bread omelet re- 
move all crust from a large slice of light, white bread, moisten with sweet 
milk, rub through a sieve, add to the yolks, beat very thoroughly, and 
season with salt and pepper to taste, adding beaten whites last. 

Washington Omelet. Let one teacup milk come to a boil, pom- 
it over one teacup bread crumbs and let stand a few minutes. Break six 
into a bowl; stir (not beat) till well mixed; then add the milk and 
bread: mix; season with salt and pepper and pour into a hot skillet, in 
\vhicha large tablespoon of butter had been melted; fry slowly, cut-in 
squares, turn, fry a delicate brown on a Majestic Range: serve at once. 

Curried Eggs. Slice two onions and fry in butter, add a table- 
spoon curry powder and one pint good broth or stock: stew till onions 
are quite tender, add a cup of cream thickened with arrowroot or rice 
flour, simmer a few moments on a Majestic Range, then add eight or ten 
hard-boiled eggs, cut in slices and beat them well, but do not boil.

Boiled Eggs. Put them on in cold water, and when it has hoiled 
on a Majestic Range the eggs will he done, the whiles being soft and di- 
gestible, as they are not when put on in hoiling water. 

Escaloped Eggs. Moislen bread crumbs with milk or meat broth, 
place a layer of this in a well-buttered dish, slice some hard-boiled eggs, 
and dip each slice in a thick drawn butter sauce to which a well-beaten 
egg has been added; put a layer of them upon the crumbs, then a slight 
layer of minced ham. veal or chicken, then bread, etc.. finishing with dry, 
sifted bread crumbs; bake until well heated in a Majestic Range. Or, 
mix equal parts minced ham and fine bread crumbs, season with salt, 
pepper and melted butter, adding milk to moisten till quite soft; half fill 
buttered gem pans or small patty pans with this mixture, and break an 
egg carefully upon the top of each, dust with salt and pepper, sprinkle 
finely powdered crackers over all, set in the oven and bake eight minutes. 
Serve immediately. 

Frizzled Ham and Eggs. Take bits of either boiled or fried 
ham. chop fine and place in a skillet prepared with butter or beef drip- 
pings: take four to six well-beaten eggs, pour over ham, and when heated 
through season well with pepper and salt; stir together, cook until done 
brown on a Majestic Range, and turn over without stirring. 

Poached Eggs. Break and drop them one at a time in salted 
water, to which some add a small lump of butter; some say drop in when 
simmering, others when boiling, not letting it bofl again after putting in 
the eggs; others have water boiling, salt, then place it where it will stop 
boiling, drop in eggs and let simmer gently till done on a Majestic Rang 
Always take great care in keeping the yolk whole. To preserve the eg, 
round, muffin rings may be placed in the water, or stir with a spoon an 
drop in the eddy thus made, stirring till egg is cooked. To serve them 
toast squares of bread three-quarters of an inch thick, put a very little 
melted butter upon each slice, place on a heated platter, lay an egg on 
each square, and sprinkle with pepper and salt. ' Some put a bit of butler 
on each egg. Serve with Worcester sauce if desired. Some poach eggs 
in milk, serving them in sauce dishes with some of the milk, and season- 
ing with pepper and salt. 

Scrambled Eggs. In a deep earthen pie plate, warm sweet milk, 
allowing two tablespoons to each egg (or less, with a large number 
eggs), add a bit of butter size of a walnut, and a little salt and peppe 
When nearly to boiling point drop in the eggs, broken one at a time in 
saucer: with a spoon or thin-bladed knife gently cut the eggs, and scrape 
the mixture up from the bottom of the plate as it cooks, if it begins t 
cook dry and fast at the bottom move the dish back instantly, for succe 
depends wholly on cooking gently and evenly, proportions being of se 
ondary importance. Take from range before it has quite all tbiekene 
and continue turning it up from the bottom of the dish a moment longe 
If served in another dish (it keeps warmer served in same) have it wel 
heated. The mixture should be in large flakes of mingled white and yel- 
low, and as delicate as baked custard. Some prefer them scrambled 
without the milk. Cook on a Majestic Range.

VEGETABLES. 



Dry Lima Beans. Wash one quart of dry lima beans in two 
warm waters, soak three hours, drain, and put on Majestic Range to cook 
in enough boiling water to cover them: cover pot with tin lid, adding 
more hot water as it boils away, boiling rapidly for one and a half hours, 
when there should be only water enough to come up to top of the beans 
ju>t sufficient to make a nice dressing. Five minutes before taking up. 
season with salt and pepper, and stir in a dressing made of one tablespoon 
each of flour and butter, rubbed together until smooth. This is a delicious 
dish. 

String Beans. String, snap and wash two quarts beans, boil on 
Majestic Range, in plenty of water about fifteen minutes, drain off and 
put on again in about two quarts boiling water; boil an hour and a half, 
and add salt and pepper just before taking up. stirring in one and a half 
tablespoons butter rubbed into two tablespoons flour and half pint sweet 
cream. 

Or, boil a piece of salted pork on Majestic Range one hour, then add 
beans and boil an hour and a half. For shelled beans boil half an hour in 
water enough to cover, and dress as above. 

Stewed Carrots. Take any quantity desired, divide the carrots 
lengthwise, and boil on Majestic Range until perfectly tender, which will 
require from one to two hours. "When done, have ready a sauce-pan with 
one or two tablespoons butter, and small cup cream; slice the carrots 
very thin, and put in the sauce-pan; add salt and pepper, and let stew ten 
or fifteen minutes, stirring gently once or twice, and serve in a vegetable 
dish. Some add more milk or cream; when done skim out carrots, and to 
the cream add a little flour thickening, or the beaten yolks of one or two 
eggs. When it boils pour over the carrots and serve. Carrots may also 
be boiled with meat like turnips or parsnips, but they take longer to cook 
than either. 

Stewed Corn. Cut with a sharp knife through the center of every 
row of grains, and cut off the outer edge; then with the back of the 
blade push out the yellow eye. with the rich, creamy center of the grain, 
leaving the hull on the cob. To one quart of this add half a pint rich 
milk, and stew until cooked in a covered tin pail, in a kettle one-third 
full of boiling water; then add salt, white pepper, and two or three 
ounces butter; allow two hours for cooking on a Majestic Range; it seems 
a long time, but there is no danger of burning, and it requires no more 
attention than to stir it occasionally and to keep good the supply of 
water. If drier than liked, add more milk or cream. Or, after cutting 
corn from the cob, boil the cobs ten or fifteen minutes and take out and 
put com in same water; when tender, add a dressing of milk, butter, 
pepper and salt, and just before serving stir in beaten eggs, allowing 
three eggs to a dozen ears of corn.

Heidelberg Cabbage. Select two small, solid heads of hard red 
cabbage; divide them in halves from crown to stem ; lay the split side 
down, and cut downwards in thin slices. The cabbage will then be in 
narrow strips or shreds. Put into a saucepan a tablespoon of clean drip- 
pings, butter, or any nice fat; when fat is hot, put in cabbage a teaspoon 
of salt, three tablespoons vinegar (if the latter is very strong use but two), 
and one onion, in which three or four cloves have been stuck, buried in 
the middle; boil two hours and a half on a Majestic Range; if it becomes 
too dry and is in danger of scorching add a very little water. This is 
very nice. 

Fried Cabbage. Cut the cabbage very fine, on a slaw cutter, if 
possible; salt and pepper, stir well, and let stand live minutes. Have an 
iron kettle smoking hot, drop one tablespoon lard into it, then the cab- 
bage, stirring briskly until quite tender; send to table immediately. 
One-half cup sweet cream and three tablespoons vinegar the vinegar 
added after the cream has been well stirred, and after taking from the 
Majestic Range, is an agreeable change. When properly done an invalid 
can eat it without injury, and there is no offensive odor from cooking. 

Dandelions. They are fit for use until they blossom. Cut off the 
leaves, pick over carefully, wash in several waters, put into boiling 
water, boil one hour, drain well, add salted boiling water, and boil two hours 
on a Majestic Range; when done, turn into a colander and drain, season 
with butter, and more salt if needed, and cut with a knife; or boil with a 
piece of salt pork, omitting the butter in the dressing. 

Boiled or Fried Onions. Wash and peel, boil ten minutes, pour 
off this water, again add boiling water, boil a few minutes and drain a 
second time; pour on boiling water, add salt and boil for one hour on a 
Majestic Range; place in a colander, turn a saucer over them and press 
firmly to drive off all the water; place in a dish and add butter and pep- 
per. Or, about half an hour before they are done, turn a pint of milk 
into the water in which they are boiling, and, when tender, season as 
above. Old onions require two hours to boil. To fry onions, slice and 
boil ten minutes each time in three waters, drain, fry in butter or beef 
drippings, stir often, season, and serve hot. 



Potatoes Boiled or Baked in Jackets. Wash clean (a brus 
is the best implement for cleaning potatoes), cut off the ends, let stand in 
cold water a few hours, put into boiling water, the larger ones first, and 
'in in a short time adding the rest, cover, and keep boiling constantly; 
er fifteen minutes throw in another handful of salt and boil another 
fifteen minutes on a Majestic Range ; try with a fork, and if it does not 
quite run through the potato, they are done. (This is called " leaving a 
bone in them. 1 ') Drain, take to door or window and shake in open air to . 
make them mealy; return to range and allow to stand uncovered for; 
moment. Or, when washed, bake in a moderate oven fifty minutes; 
place in a steamer half an hour over water kept constantly boiling; serve 
immediately; or, wash and peel medium-sized ones and bake in pan with 
roast meat, basting often with the drippings.

Boiled Corn. Put the well-cleaned ears in salted boiling water. 
boil an hour on a Majestic Range, or boil in the husk for the same time, 
remove husks and serve immediately. Corn thoroughly cooked is a 
wholesome dish. 

Hominy. Soak one quart of ground hominy over night, put over 
the fire in a tin pail, set in boiling water with water enough to cover, boil 
gently for five hours on a Majestic Range, as it can not be hurried. After 
the grains begin to soften on no account stir it. The water put in at first 
ought to be enough to finish it, but if it proves too little, add more care- 
fully, as too much makes it sloppy. Salt just before taking from the 
range, as too early salting makes it dark. Jf properly done, the grains 
will stand out snowy and well done, but round and separate. 

Boiled Cauliflower. To each half gallon water allow heaped ta- 
blespoon salt; choose close and white cauliflower, trim off decayed out- 
side leaves, and cut stock off flat at bottom ; open flower a little in places 
to remove insects which generally are found about the stalk, and let 
cauliflowers lie with heads downward in salt and water for two hours pre- 
vious to dressing them, which will effectually draw out all vermin. Then 
put into boiling water, adding salt in above proportion, and boil briskly 
for fifteen or twenty minutes over a good fire on a Majestic Range, keep- 
ing the saucepan uncovered. The water should be well skimmed. When 
cauliflowers are tender, take up. drain, and if large enough place upright 
in dish ; serve with plain melted butter, a little of which may be poured 
over the flowers, or a white sauce may be used made as follows : 

Put butter size of an egg into the saucepan, and when it bubbles stir 
in a scant half teacup of flour; stir well with an egg whisk until cooked; 
then add two teacups of thin cream, some pepper and salt. Stir it over 
the fire until perfectly smooth. Pour the sauce over the cauliflower and 
serve. Many let the cauliflower simmer in the sauce a few moments before 
serving. Cauliflower is delicious served as a garnish around spring chicken, 
or with fried sweetbreads, when the white sauce should be poured over 
both. In this case it should be made by adding the cream, flour, and 
seasoning to the little grease (half a teaspoon) that is left after frying the 
chickens or sweetbreads. 

Delicate Cabbage. Remove all defective leaves, quarter and cut 
as for coarse slaw, cover well with cold water, and let remain several 
hours before cooking, then drain and put into pot with enough boiling 
water to cover; boil on a Majestic Range until thoroughly cooked (which 
will generally require about forty-five minutes), add salt ten or fifteen 
minutes before removing from fire, and when done, take up in a colander, 
press out the water well, and season with butter and pepper. This is a 
good dish to serve with corned meats, but should not be cooked with 
them ; if preferred, however, it may be seasoned by adding some of the 
liquor and fat from the boiling meat to the cabbage while cooking. Or. 
cut the cabbage in two, remove the hard stock, let stand in cold water 
two hours, tie in thin netting or piece of muslin, and boil in salted water 
for a longer time than when it is cut finely. Drain, remove, and serve in 
a dish with drawn butter, or a cream dressing poured over it.

GAS RANGES. 

On the three following pages will be found cuts of our new line of 
Majestic Gas Ranges, with description. In the construction, bringing out. 
and introduction of these ranges we followed the dictates of a compre- 
hensive understanding as to the wants of the people, and submit our work 
to their judgment. 

It is not our policy to claim merit by decrying the make of others, 
hence we speak only of the-Majestic. It may be difficult, but people will 
learn that a Gas Range should not be a temporary affair, used to-day, 
thrown away to-morrow. Judgment and sound sense ought to teach 
them that iron or steel subject to intense heat should be heavy, strong 
and well made. 

The steady growth in the use of gas as a fuel for cooking induced u 
to undertake the manufacture of a Gas Range that would be permanent, in 
fact everlasting; and to this end we make them only of the best material 
obtainable. 

The bodies, ovens, and centre flues are made of the best cold-rolled 
steel; oven doors, frames, hinges, stakes, and gravity handles, of malle- 
able iron ; other pavt.< best gray iron. All parts in steel and malleabl 
are riveted firmly and solidly together. 

Our new Mantel and Closet Shelves are conveniences much appreci 
"ated by users. Our burners are new and made with a view to the smalles 
consumption of gas. 

Our water heater is the largest ever made, it having 432 square inche 
of direct fire surf ace; it can be connected with either range. Our con 
necting gas pipes and pin valves are so made as to preclude the possibili 
of escaping gas, and are so simple that a child may connect and operate 
them. 

Door panels and all fittings are nickel plated and highly polished. 
Shelf bands and brackets polished. Looked at from all the different 
standpoints, it is the greatest and best Gas Range in the world.

SOUPS. 



Stock. Four pounds of shin of beef, or four pounds of knuckle of 
veal, or two pounds of each; any bones, trimmings of poultry, or fresh 
meat, quarter pound of lean bacon or ham. two ounces of butter, two large 
onions, each stuck with cloves: one turnip, three carrots, one head of 
celery, three lumps of sugar, two ounces of salt, half a teaspoonful of 
whole pepper, one large blade of mace, one bunch of savory herbs, four 
quarts and half pint of cold water. Cut up the meat and bacon, or ham, 
into pieces of about three inches square; rub the butter on the bottom of 
the stewpan : put in half a pint of water, the meat, and all the other in- 
gredients. Cover the stewpan, and place it on a Majestic Range, having a 
sharp fire, occasionally stirring its contents. When the bottom of the pan 
becomes covered with a pale, jelly-like substance, add the four quarts of 
cold water, and simmer very gently for five hours. As we have said be- 
fore, do not let it boil quickly. Remove every particle of scum while it is 
doing, and strain it through a five hair sieve. Time: five and one half 
hours. Average cost, twenty-five cents per quart. 

Beef Soup. Take bones and trimmings from a sirloin steak, put 
over fire after breakfast in three quarts water, boil steadily until about an 
hour before dinner, when add two onions, one carrot, three common-sized 
potatoes, all sliced, some parsley cut fine, a red pepper, and salt to taste 
and put on a Majestic Range. This makes a delicious soup, sufficient for 
three persons. All soups are more palatable seasoned with onions and red 
pepper, using the seeds of the latter with care, as they are very strong. 

Veal Soup. To about three pounds of a joint of veal, which must 
be well broken up, put four quarts of water and set it over to boil on a Ma- 
jolic Range. Prepare one fourth pound of macaroni by boiling it by 
it-cit. with sufficient water to cover it; add a little butter to the macaroni 
when it is tender, strain the soup and season to taste with salt and pepper, 
then add the macaroni in the water in which it is boiled. The addition of 
a pint of rich milk or cream and celery flavor is relished by many. 

Chicken Soup. In boiling chickens for salad, etc., the broth 
(water in which they are boiled) may be used for soup. When the chick- 
ens are to bo served whole, stuff and tie in a cloth. To the broth add a 
dozen tomatoes (or a quart can), and one thinly-sliced onion; boil twenty 
minutes on a Majestic Range, season with salt and pepper, add two well- 
beaten eggs and serve. 

Noodles for Soup. Rub into two eggs as much sifted flour as 
they will absorb ; then roll out until thin as a wafer; dust over a little 
flour, and then roll over and over into a roll, cut off thin slices from the 
edge of the roll and shake out into long strips; put them into the soup 
lightly and boil for ten minutes on a Majestic Range; salt should be added 
while mixing with the flour about a saltspoonful.

Oyster Soup. Two quarts of oysters, one quart of milk, two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, one teacupful hot water; pepper, salt. Strain all the 
libuor from the oysters; add the water and heat. When near the boil, 
add the seasoning, then the oysters. Cook on a Majestic Range about five 
minutes from the time they begin to simmer, until they "ruffle." Stir in 
the butter, cook one minute and pour into the tureen. Stir in the boiling 
milk, and send to table. 

Tomato Soup. Tomato soup is a much relished American dish, 
and is prepared as follows: Steam, or rather stew slowly, a mess of 
turnips, carrots, and onions, also a stalk of celery, with half a pound of 
lean ham and a little bit of fresh butter over a slow" lire for an hour . 
on a Majestic Range. Then add two quarts of diluted stock or of other 
liquor in which meat has been boiled, as also eight or ten ripe tomate<. 
Slew the whole for an hour and a half, then pass through the sieve into 
the pan again; add a little pepper and salt, boil for ten minutes and serve 
hot. 

To Get up a Soup in Haste. Chop some cold cooked meat fine, 
and put a pint into a stew-pan with some gravy, season with pepper and 
salt and a little butter if the gravy is not rich, add a little flour moistened 
with cold water, and three pints boiling water, boiled moderately half an 
hour on a Majestic Range. Strain over some rice or nicely toasted bread, 
and serve. Uncooked meat may be used by using one quart of cold water 
to a pound of chopped meat, and letting it stand half an hour before boil- 
ing. Celery root may be grated in as seasoning, or a bunch of parsley 
thrown in. 

Bean Soup. Boil a small soup-bone in about two quarts water 
until thf meat can be separated from the bone, remove bone, add a coffee- 
cup white beans soaked for two hours, boil for an hour and a half on a 
Majestic Range, add three potatoes, half a turnip and a parsnip, all sliced 
''oil half an hour longer, and just before serving sprinkle in a few dry 
bread-crumbs; season with salt and pepper, and serve with raw onions 
sliced very line for those who like them. 

Potato Soup. Potato soup is suitable for a cold day. Make it in 
the following manner: Get as many beef or ham bones as yen can, and 
smash them into fragments. Add a little bit of lean ham to give flavor. 
Boil the bone and ham for two hours and a half at least on a Majestic 
Range. The bone of a roast beef is excellent. Strain off the liquor care- 
fully, empty out the bones and debris of the ham. restore the liquor to the 
put. and place again on the fire. Having selected, washed, and pared 
some nice potatoes, cut them into small pieces, and boil them in the stock 
till they melt away. An onion or two may also be boiled among the bones 
to help the flavor.* I do not like thick potato soup, and I usually strain it 
through a hair sieve, after doing so placing it again on the fire, seasoning 
it with pepper and salt to taste. A stick of celery boiled with the bones 
is an improvement. Make only the quantity required for the day, as po- 
tato soup is best when it is newly made.

Ox-Tail Soup. Take two ox tails and two whole onions, two 
rots, a small turnip, two tablespoonfuls of Hour, and a little white pepper, 
add a gallon of water, let all boil for two hours on a Majestic Range : then 
take out the tails and cut the meat into small pieces, return the bonr- to 
the pot, for a short time, boil for another hour, then strain the sou]), and 
rinse two spoonfuls of arrowroot to add to it with the meat cut from the 
bones, and let all boil for a quarter of an hour. 

Vegetable Soup. Two pounds of course, lean beef, cut into st 
two pounds of knuckle of veal, chopped to pieces, two pounds of mutton 
bones, and the bones left from your cold veal, cracked to splinters, one 
pound of lean ham, four large carrots, two turnips, two onions, bunch of 
herbs, three tablespoonfuls of butter, and two of flour, one tablespoonful 
of sugar, salt and pepper, seven quarts of water. Put on meat, bones, 
herbs and water, and cook slowly live hours on a Majestic Range. Strain 
the soup, of which there should be live quarts. Season meat and bones, 
and put into the stock-pot with three quarts of the liquor. Save this for 
days to come. While the soup for to-day is cooling that you may take off 
the fat, put the butter into a frying pan with the sliced carrots, turnips, 
and onions, and fry to a light brown. Now. add a pint of the skimmed 
stock, and stew the vegetables tender, stir in the flour wet with water, and 
put all, with your cooled stock, over the fire in the soup-kettle. Season 
with sugar, cayenne and salt, boil five minutes, rub through a colander, 
then a soup-sieve, heat almost to boiling, and serve. 

Lobster Soup. Procure a large hen fish, boiled, and with all its 
coral, if possible. Cut away from it all the meat in neat little pieces; 
beat up the fins and minor claws in a mortar, then stew the results in a 
stew-pan, slowly, along with a little white stock; season this with a bunch 
of sweet herbs: a small onion, a little bit of celery, and a carrot may be 
placed in the stock, as also the toasted crust of a French roll. Season to 
taste with salt and a little cayenne. Simmer the whole lor about an hour 
on a Majestic Range; then strain and return the liquor to the saucepan, 
place in it the pieces of lobster, and having beaten up the coral in a little 
flour and gravy, stir it in. Let the soup remain on the fire for a few 
minutes without boiling and serve hot. A small strip of the rind of a 
lemon may be boiled in the stock, and a little nutmeg may be added to 
the seasoning. This is a troublesome soup to prepare, but there are many 
who like it when it is well made. 

Green Pea Soup. Wash a small quarter of lamb in cold water, 
and put it into a soup-pot with six quarts of cold water; add to it two 
tablespoonfuls of salt, and set it on a Majestic Range over a moderate fire 
let it boil gently for two hours, then skim it clear, add a quart of shelled 
peas, and a teaspoonful of pepper; cover it, and let it boil for half an 
hour, then having scraped the skins from a quart of small young poi 
add them to the soup; cover the pot, and let it boil for half an hour 
longer; work quarter pound of butter, and a dessert spoonful of flour to- 
gether, and add them to the soup ten or twelve minutes before taking it 
off the fire. Serve the meat on the dish with parsley sauce over, and the 
soup in a tureen.

or a mixture of crackers and bread-crumbs may be used when more con- 
venient. As the amount of liquor in oysters varies, and the proportion 
of crackers or bread-crumbs to the oysters also varies, tin? quantity of 
water must be increased or diminished according to judgment and taste. 
Some prefer to coek half the time given above. Boiled macaroni may be 
used in place of cracker crumbs. 

Fried Oysters. Drain carefully, remove all bits of shell, and 
sprinkle with pepper and salt, and set in a cool place -for ten or fifteen 
minutes. Then, if oysters are small, pour them into a pan of crackers 
rolled fine, add the liquor, mix well, and let stand five minutes, add a 
little salt and pepper, mold into small cakes with two or three oysters in 
each, roll in dry crackers until well encrusted, and fry in a Majestic 
Range, in hot lard and butter, or beef-drippings. Serve hot in a covered 
dish. 

Or. dip the oysters in the yolk of eggs, well seasoned and beaten, then 
in corn meal with a little baking powder mixed with it. and fry in Maj< -tie 
Range, in hot lard like doughnuts; or if you have frying basket, place 
them on that and drop it in the hot lard. Test the heat as for doughnuts. 

Or, drain thoroughly, put in a hot frying-pan, in a Majestic Range, 
turn so as to brown on both sides. They cook in this way in a few 
moments, and the peculiar ilavor of the oysters is well preserved. Serve 
on a hot covered dish, with butter, pepper and salt, or add a little cream 
just before serving, and serve on toast: or take two parts rolled crackers 
and one part corn meal, mix well, roll the oysters in it. and fry in equal 
parts butter and lard. Season with salt and pepper. 

Oyster Fritters. Drain off liquor, boil, skim, and to a cupful add 
a cup of milk, two or three eggs, salt and pepper, and flour enough to 
make a rather thick batter. Have hot lard or beef drippings ready in a 
kettle, on a Majestic Range, drop the batter into it with a large spoon, 
taking up one oyster for each spoonful. The oyster must be large and 
plump.

Panned Oysters. Cut stale bread in thin slices, then round them, 
removing all crust. Make them to fit patty-pans; toast them, butter, and 
place in pans. Moisten with three or four teaspoons of oyster liquor: 
then place on the toast a layer of oysters, sprinkle with pepper, and put 
on top a small piece of butter; place pans in a baking pan and put in a 
Majestic Range oven, covering with a tin lid, or if not large enough, 
another pan to keep in the steam and flavor; have a quick oven, and when 
cooked seven or eight minutes, until '-ruffled,'' remove cover and sprinkle 
with salt; replace cover and cook one minute longer. Serve in the patty- 
pans. This is delicious. 

Oyster Roll. Cut a round piece, say six inches across, from the top 
of a well-baked round loaf of bread, remove the inside from the loaf, 
leaving crust half an inch thick; make a rich oyster stew, and put in the 
loaf first a layer of it, then of bread crumbs, then oysters, and so on; place 
cover over the top. glaze the loaf with the beaten yolk of an egg, and 
place in Majestic Range oven for a few moments, Serve very hot. 

Oysters in the Shell. Open the shells, keeping the deepest ones 
for use. Melt some butter, season with minced parsley and pepper. 
When slightly cooled, roll each oyster in it, using care that It drips but 
little, and lay in the shells. Add to each shell a little lemon juice. 
with grated bread-crumbs, place in a baking-pan and bake in a quick 
Majestic Range oven; just before they are done add a little salt. Serve in 
the shells. 

Oyster Stew. Put the liquor from the oysters on the Majestic 
Range, let boil, skim, and season with butter and pepper, add oysters. 
let come to a boil only, season with salt and serve. This is pronounced 
a "royal stew.'' 

Steamed Oysters. Lay some oysters in the shell in some air-tight 
vessel, placing the upper shell downward so the liquor will not run out 
when they open. Set them on a Majestic Range over a pot of boiling 
water (where they will get the steam), and boil hard for twenty minuti-s : 
if the oysters are open they are done; if not, steam till they do open. 
Serve at once and eat hot, with salt and a bit of butter. 

Or, wash and drain one quart select oysters, put on a Majestic R;i 
in pan, and place in steamer over boiling water, cover and steam til! 
oysters are plump with edges ruffled; place in heated dish with butter, 
pepper and salt, and serve. 

Oyster Omelet. Add to a half cup of cream six eggs beaten very 
light, season with pepper and salt, pour into a frying-pan on a Majestic 
Range, with a tablespoon of butter; drop in a do/en large oysters cut in 
halves, or chopped fine with parsely, and fry until a light brown. Double 
it over and serve immediately. 

Oyster Patties. Take of oysters according to the number to be 
served. Place the oysters in the same pan with butter, pepper, salt and a. 
little flour: stir, and let simmer a few minutes on a Majestic Range. Bake 
shells of rich puff paste in patty tins, and also small rounds for covers; 
heat the shells and fill with oysters; put on the covers and set in the 
Majestic Range oven for five minutes. Serve immediately.

COFFEE, TEA, ETC, 



Steamed Coffee. Put coffee into the pot, pour the boiling water 
on it; place this pot (which is made to lit) into the top of the tea-kettle, 
and let cook from ten to twenty minutes on a Majestic Itange, while 
water in kettle is kept boiling all the time. This makes a clear, delicious 
coffee. Some persons hold that by first wetting the coffee with cold 
water, bringing it to boiling point, and then pouring in water, more of 
the strength is extracted. 

Army Coffee. Coffee or tea may be made quickly by placing the 
required quantity of cold water in the pot and adding the coffee tied up 
in a sack of a line gauze or piece of muslin; bring to boiling point, boil 
live minutes and serve. Make tea in the same way, except that the tea is 
put loose in the water and simply allowed to boil up once on a Majestic 
Range. 

Coffee with Whipped Cream. For six cups of coffee of fair 
si/o take one cup sweet cream whipped light with a little sugar; put into 
each cup the desired amount of sugar and about a tablespoon boiling 
milk: pour the coffee over these and lay upon the surface of the hot liquid 
a large spoonful of the frothed cream, giving a gentle stir to each cup 
before serving. This is known to some as meringued coffee and is an 
I'i'-gant French preparation of the popular drink. Chocolate served in 
this way is delicious. 

Vienna Coffee. Filter instead of boiling the coffee, allowing one 
tablespoon ground coffee to each person and "'one for the pot; "put a 

quart of cream into a custard kettle or pail set in boiling water, and put 
it where it will keep boiling; beat the white of an egg to a froth, and mix 
well with three tablespoons cold milk. As soon as the cream is hot re- 
move from lire, add the mixed egg and milk, stir together briskly for a 
minute, and then serve. 

Another method is to pour boiling water over the coffee, cover 
closely, boil one minute, remove to the side of the range a few minutes to 
. and serve. Allow two heaping tablespoons coffee to a pint of 
water. The less time the coffee is cooked the more coffee is required, but 
the liner the flavor. The late Professor Blot protested against boiling the 
coffee at all. as in his opinion the aroma was evaporated and only the 
bitter flavor left. 

Tea. Pour into a granite tea-steeper a very little boiling water, and 
then put in the tea, allowing one teaspoon of tea to each person. Pour 
over this boiling water until the steeper is little more than half full; 
cover tightly and let it stand where it will keep hot but not boil, 
the tea infuse, for ten or fifteen minutes and then pour into the grs

tea-urn, adding more boiling water, in the proportion of one cup of 
water for every teaspoon of dry tea which has been infused. Have boil- 
ing water in a water-pot, and weaken each cup of tea as desired. Do not 
use water for tea that has boiled long. Spring water is best for tea, and 
filtered water next best. Tea should never be boiled, but be sure that the 
water boils that you use for steeping. From three to five minutes is suf- 
ficient time ; if it stands longer the tea is apt to lose its aroma and have 
the bitter taste of the leaf. 

Chocolate. Grate chocolate, allowing for one quart of water six 
tablespoonfuls of chocolate; mix smooth with a little water and boil 
fifteen minutes on a Majestic Range, add one quart rich milk, boil a few 
minutes longer, and serve hot, with sugar. 

Chocolate. Take six tablespoons scraped chocolate, or three of 
chocolate and three of cocoa, dissolve in a quart of boiling water, boil 
bard fifteen minutes, add one quart of rich milk, let scald, and serve hot. 
This is enough for six persons. Cocoa can also be made after this recipe : 
Some boil either coca or chocolate only one minute and then serve, while 
others make it the day before using, boiling tt for one hour on a Majestic 
.Range, and when cool skimming off the oil, and when wanted for use. 
heat it to the boiling point and add the milk. In this way it is equally 
good and much more wholesome. Cocoa is from the seed of the fruit of 
a small tropical tree. There are several forms in which it is sold, the 
most nutritious and convenient being chocolate, the next cocoa, then 
cocoa nibs, and last cocoa shells. The ground bean is simply cocoa; 
ground fine and mixed with sugar it is chocolate; the beans broken into 
bits are " nibs." The shells are the shells of the bean, usually removed 
before grinding. The beans are roasted like coffee and ground between 
hot rollers. 

Vienna Chocolate. Put into a coffee-pot set in boiling water one 
quart of new milk (or a pint each of cream and milk), stir into it three 
lumping tablespoons grated chocolate mixed to a paste with a cold milk, 
let it boil two or three minutes and serve at once. To make good choco- 
late good, materials are required. 

Iced Tea. Prepare tea in the morning making it stronger and 
sweeter than usual; strain and pour into a clean stone jug or glass bottle 
and set aside in the ice-chest until ready to use. Drink from goblets 
without cream. Serve ice broken in small pieces on a platter nicely gar- 
nished with well-washed grape leaves. Iced tea may be prepared from 
either green or black alone, but it is considered an improvement to mix 
the two. Tea made like that for iced tea (or that left in the tea-pot after 
a meal), -with sugar to taste, a slice or two of lemon, a little of the juice, 
and some pieces of cracked ice makes a delightful drink. Serve in 
glasses.

WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW. 

That a range, a stove, or heating apparatus, has no more draught 

than a steam boiler or a square box. 
That the chimney creates the draught; the taller, the better the 

draught. 

That it should be higher than any other part of the building. 
That it should be not less than 9x9 inches inside, and smooth. 
That two smoke pipes should not enter the same chimney. 
That every other flue opening in the chimney must be closed. 
That the space below where the pipe enters should be cut off 
That new chimneys are often left half filled with brick and mortar. 
That old flues are often cracked outside, not half high enough, and 

full of soot. 

That such conditions kill the draught. 

That the pipe entering chimney must be same size as on the range. 
That the larger the range, the larger and higher must be the chim- 
ney. 
That good fuel must be provided; if wood, well seasoned; if coal, 

well selected. 

That the fire-box should not be filled above top of linings. 
That the flues of range must be cleaned once a week. 
That in 10,000 Majestic Ranges not twenty complaints are made by 

the users. 
That such complaints are caused wholly by bad flues, or inefficient 

cooks. 

That our guarantee is based upon the assumption 
That the purchaser will provide the proper chimney flue. 
That dealers are not authorized to say ; -They will take it back." 
That it is too well established to need such an assertion. 
That we and our dealers guarantee the range, and not the flue. 
That under proper conditions nothing on earth works belt
