In the first place, I want to say that I indeed feei 
complimented to have The Pentecostal Publishing Com- 
pany accept my manuscript. They being the oldest and 
most reliable house of the kind in the south and make a 
specialty of standard and religious works, and to have 
them comment on my manuscript as they do in a letter 
which I have just received from them, is indieed over- 
whelming, and far surpasses my expectations, especially 
when they say it is the best book for the home they have 
ever seen, and also predict that "The Model House- 
keeper'^ will be the household book of the future. In 
speaking further of the different departments they say 
I seem to have caught the idea so essential to health and 
economy in the cooking department, which they say 
most cook books seem to have lost sight of entirely, I 
must adimit that I earnestly endeavored to do this in 
every recipe for which I claim, after a thorough test, to 
be the very best and most perfect recipes; a great many 
of which were used and handed down for several genera- 
tions in my own family, and I repeat without egotism, 
what I have often been told that they were noted for 
their exquisite taste, not only in cooking, but in serv- 
ing as well. In going further into my manuscript. The 
Pentecostal Publishing Company speaks in very compli- 
mentary terms of its different departments, but espec-

Preface. 15 

ially dio they mention in highest terms, "The Family 
Doctor'' and "Home Kemedy Departments" by saying it 
will .save the housewife many hundlreds of dollars, and 
that both young ladies and matrons could but be both 
pleased and much benefited by the "Toilet Department" 
which lie says is perfect in every detail, and closes by 
saying that the miscellaneous department alone is worth 
many times the price of the book, which he goes on 
further to say, I underestimate to sell foT $1.50, 
and also says in conclusion, if the many hint? 
given in the different departments are carried out by 
the housekeeper it will not only save her many dollars 
but much worry. Indeed, I have left nothing undone 
in my endeavor to have the book all the publishers 
claim for it, and each recipe, suggestion, and recom- 
mendation, has been selected with most scrupulous care; 
many of them from the very best authority on the dif- 
ferent subjects through a period of many years to the 
present time. In every instance I have earnestly en- 
deavored to be as honest and sincere as it is possible to 
be, and believe that a test will convince all that I had 
the best interest of my fellowman at heart thTOughout 
the entire publication, and pray that in putting this little 
work before the public that it may be accepted in the 
same spirit in which it is written. 



(TooKing i)ef)artment» 

One of the greatest and most deserved] compliments 
for a wife is to be a good and artistic cook, and the 
companion she has chosen to set at the head of her ex- 
quisitely-appointed table revels in the delight of her 
wichery and dispenses hospitality quite in keeping with 
it. Eealizing to its fullest extent, that he has secured 
a 'Tear! of great price." And if she acts upon all the 
hints given in the following chapters she will not only 
save him many dollars but herself much worry and 
vexation. Eealizing that only by attention to small de- 
tail can she keep her home as she should, she, I am sure, 
will find her duties much lighter if she makes the meals 
more simple. One good and substantial meal a day is 
much more enjoyed and the digestive organs in much 
better condition to receive it if she makes the other two 
quite simple, and the dear housewife will find much 
more time for other duties, and the enjoyment of her 
family. The menu for each day during the week s.hould 
be prepared on Saturday for the week following, whicb. 
although it may take up a few minutes of her time, sh^ 
will find she has saved time and much worry in the end. 
Should you find a few changes necessary, supply an- 
other food in its place of like value. It is a very desir- 
able plan to have one meal of each day entirely of left- 
overs. Cold meats and vegetables can be made into pies, 
soups, salads, sandwiches, hash, or gravies.

S0Uf5» 

Says Savarin, one of the greatest authorities on din- 
ing: "A soup and a salad and the dinner is complete." 
Heavy, rich foods taken into an empty stomach often 
pi'od-uce nervous indigestion. The laboring man as weJ: 
as brain workers, should, at the beginning of a heavy 
dinner, sip a little very hot soup, sprinkled generously 
with red .pepper. This at once starts the gastric secre- 
tions and prepares the stomach for the food that is to 
follow. Soujp should only be served hot (not luke- 
warm), and in small quantities, and should always be 
an important factor in the dietary of every household. 
For poor appetites the clear soups are decidedly stimu- 
lating and easily assimilated by both young and old. 

The cream soups and purees are more nutritious 
soups are grouped into two main classes^ — soups made 
from meats, and soups made without meat. 

Always make meat soups w^ith cold water, to which 
salt has been added, and gradually heat to boiling point 
but never boil. Allows one quart of cold water to every 
pound of meat, and one teaspoon of salt to every quart 
of water. Heat gradually to boiling ipoint and cook at a 
low temperature for several hours; strain soup and cool 
quickly to avoid fermentation. The cake of fat which 
forms on top should not be removed until stock is ready 
for use. Run a knife around ed'ges of fat and lift cake

to remove it. Use this fat for drippings. With but a 
small outlay one can keep on hand a supply of what is 
essential for seasoning soups, such sweet herbs as 
thyme, savory, marjoram, parsley, sage, celery roots, 
or dried celery leaves are richer than the stalks. Celery 
seed or celery salt may be substituted. Such spices as 
allspice, cloves, nutmeg, mace, whole peppers andi stick 
cinnamon root, ginger, etc., should always be kept on 
hand. Flour, corn starch, arrow root, tapioca, sage, 
pearl barley, rice bread and eggs are added to give 
consistency and nourishment. 

Oyster Soup. — One That Never Fails. 

One quart of oysters with liquor drained off and 
well washed. Put in pan and just cover with hot water ; 
add! to this a little butter, salt, red and black pepper, 
and just let boil up and have three pints of milk in 
another sauce pan; a double boiler is best to prevent 
scorching; adid a heaping tablespoonful of butter, a lit- 
tle salt and pepper, and just let come to a boil and 
pour over oysters and serve at once, with butter crackers. 

Tomato Soup. 

One can of tomatoes or samie quantity in fre^h to- 
matoes ; let cook in sauce pan for ten minutes, add from 
one-fourth to one-half teaspoon of soda, according to 
acidity of tomatoes, salt and pepper to taste. To this 
amount add about one-half gallon of fresh, rich milk 
and one-half teacup of butter. Pour over tomatoes after 
they have boiled for about ten minutes after adding milk. 



Soups. 19 

Let come to a boil and thicken with cracker crumbs, ad- 
ding a few whole crackers if preferred; salt, red and 
black pepper to taste. Good for every day in the year 
and can scarcely be told from oyster soup. 

Beef Soup. 

Best of all use for every Aay purposes. Any kind of 
roast beef may be used for this in a way that the quali- 
ty of meat is but very little injured if at all. If the 
size roast is large enough to extract sufficient strength 
for soup it may be put on in boiling water, which is 
contrary to most soup making, but from my own experi- 
ence I know it answers every purpose in this case and 
retains sufficient juices to insure a delicious roast and 
3'et extracts sufficient strength for soup. 

Put roast in about three quarts of boiling water, skim 
well when it first begins to boil; after about one-half 
done add salt and red pepper to taste. Let cook one- 
half hour longer, and if water should (become too low 
add just a little at a time, and to make meat tender 
when first put on add two or three tablespoonsful of 
vinegar about ten minutes before putting roast in to 
bake, peel andl put in pot the desired amount of Irish 
potatoes and when about one-half cooked take up roast 
in baking pan with potatoes around it. Flour top of 
roast generously and pour one pint of cold water in 
soup, which causes most of the grease to come on top, 
and skim this off with some of liquor and put over beef 
and potatoes ; add a little more salt and pepper to meat 
and put in stove and bake a nice brown in a quick oven. 



20 Model Housekeeper. 

Take liquor in which roast was cooked and add one tea- 
cupful of potatoes cut in smail dice, one teacupful of to- 
matoes cut up fine, two-thirds teacup of onions, a stalk 
of celery and a little corn. Then put in three or four 
whole potatoes. Should you like the flavor of turnips, a 
teacup full cut u^p fine should be put on with the beef. 
After these vegetables have become perfectly tender take 
out the whole Irish potatoes, mash and season as for 
(baking, and return to soup, which gives it a most delic- 
ious flavor and possibly will thicken' it sufficiently, if 
not, thicken with a little flour in water. This soup is 
pronounoed by all who have tried it to be very su- 
perior. 

Navy Beam, Soup. 

Put on in about one-half gallon of cold water, one 
pint of beans with enough salt pork of any kind for 
.seasoning, a few slices of bacon or parts of ham, or 
shoulder that are no longer good for hoiling. However a 
very small piece will suffice. Cook until beans are easily 
mashed. Take out of water and run through a colan- 
der, remove skins and return mashed beans to soup 
water, add one pint of rich sweet milk, taiblespoonful 
ibutter, a little salt and pepper, and should beans not 
make it sufficiently thick, add a little flour mixed smooth 
with water. Etxcellent. 

Black Bean Soup. 

Soak one pint of beans several hours and put on with 
a knuckle of veal. Cook three or four hours and strain

liquor. Pick off some small bits of veal and return with 
stock to pot. Thicken with browned crackers powdered 
fine and sifted. Flavor with a little ground allspice, 
pepper; slice three hard boiled eggs; a little sliced lemon 
put in tureen and pour over soup. 

Bread Soup. 

Break into small pieces three-fourths loaf stale 
bread, cover with water; salt and pepper to taste. Sim- 
mer slowly for three-fourths hour. Press through a 
colander, put on fire, add heaping tablespoon butter, beat 
yelks of two eggs light, stir into one cup of rich cream. 
Then stir slowly into the soup; serve hot with crackers. 

Veal Soup. 

Put a knuckle of veal in three and one-half quarts of 
cold water, and one tablespoon of uncooked rice and salt 
to taste. Simmer very slowly about four hours and a 
half, which should reduce liquor about one-half; re- 
move from the fire, put into tureen the yelk of one eg^ 
and stir well into it a teacup of cream or rich new 
milk, add butter size of small egg; strain the soup on 
this boiling hot, stirring constantly, then beat well for 
a minute. 

Turkey Soup. 

Boil tur'key bones about one hour or longer in enough 
water to well cover them ; add a little chopped celery and 
parsley, salt, popper and butter to taste, one teacup of

cream if preferredl Thicken with pulverized cracker 
cinimbs sifted. This is a cheap but good soup. 

Chiclcen Soiip. 

Out up a nice fat chicken after it has lain in salt 
for several hours and pour over one and one-half gallons 
of cold water and cook very slowly for three and one- 
half hours; one teacup of rice or broken up 'bits maca- 
roni, one teacup of cream or very rich, sweet milk ; salt 
and pepper to taste, and a little chopped parsley. Thick- 
en with flour mixed with cold water. Serve with toast 
or butter crackers. 

Brown Soup Stoch. 

Seven lbs. shin beef, three and one-half quarts water, 
cold, one-half teaspoon pepper corn, ten cloves, one-'half 
Bay leaf, one sprig of marjoram, three sprigs of parsley, 
two-thirds teacup each of celery, onions, turnips, cut in 
dice; salt to taste. Wipe meat very dry and cut it in 
one inch cubes. Take marrow from marrow bone, and 
brown nicely, about one-third of meat in frying pan 
w'ith this fat. Put with remaining two-thirds of meat 
with bone and fat into kettle, add salt and water. Let 
stand about three-fourths hour. Then heat very grad- 
ually to boiling point. Let sim'mer very slowly for sev- 
eral hours; add seasoning and vegetables the last hour 
of cooking. iSitrain and cool quickly. 

To Clanfy Stoclc. 

White of one egg for each quart of stock. Beat light- 



Soups. 23 

ly and stir in stoclc cold, and let boil up once, and set 
where it will keep warm for a few minutes. Then skim 
off the egg and skum and strain. 

Always have ready a vessel for lef1>overs — all pieces 
of meat, bone, scraps of chicken and vegetables, in fact 
almost anything if covered with cold water and simmer 
for three or four hours will make a good com'pound 
stock. This stock when clarified makes a good con- 
somme. 

Inexpensvve Soup. 

Small quantities of left-over vegetables are utilized 
for the cream soupe. Every bit of meat, every bone on 
the serving-plate, the carcasses of turkeys, ducks and 
chickens are put aside for stock. The giblets, neck and 
feet of poultry are utilized for giblet soup. The feet of 
poultry are especially rich in gelatine whic'h gives body 
and consistency to the stock. Two kinds of vegetables 
left over may be pressed through a sieve, seasoned and 
thinned with milk, or, which is more economical, thinn- 
ed with stock and with just enough milk added to give 
color. Pleasant and desirable combinations are made 
from potato and celery, oyster and celery, onions and 
milk alone, peas alone, peas and tomatoes, or corn and 
tomatoes. Okra combines nicely with corn, or with both 
corn and tomatoes. 

Mutton Broth. 

Purchase from your butcher five pounds of the neck 
of a yearling. Cover with four quarts of cold water 



24 Model House'keeper. 

and put on the back of the range for an hour, then 
move to a warmer place, where it will simmer gently. 
Add one onion, sliced, two bay leaves, salt and pepper, 
and let it boil or simmer slowly for four hours. Strain, 
and .stand in a cool place until morning, when it will 
have formed a jelly. Eemiove all the fat from the top 
and place the broth on the fire. Wash two tablespoon- 
fuls of barley, pour boiling water on it, let it boil up 
once; then drain. Cover again with boiling water and 
boil for half an hour. Then drain again, and add to 
the soup. 

Corn Soup. 

Grate the corn from six ears ; put the cobs in a kettle, 
pour over three pints of boiling water and let boil half 
an hour; remove them, add the grated corn and boil 
twenty minutes ; strain, season and let simmer ; rub two 
tablespoons of flour and three of butter together, add to 
the soup and stir until it thickens; pour in a pint of 
boiling milk, let coo'k one minute, stir in the beaten 
yolks of three eggs and serve. 

For rice soup add a feW taiblespoons of boiled rice 
to well-seasoned, hot stock. 

For consomme a la 'Colbert — ^a nice soup for a din- 
ner without meat — drop into a tureen of hot, clear stock 
one poached egg for each person to be served. 

To make consomme a la Eoyal add custard block??

To make "grandmother" soup — one of the nicest com- 
mon, everyday soups-— cut two slices of stale bread into 



Soups. 25 

dice, break over them one whole egg, stir until each 
block is covered with the egg, drop them! on top of the 
boiling stock, boil for a minute and serve. This is an 
excellent soup for the children when they come home, 
tired and hungry, from school. It is far better than 
bread and jam.; it rests and stimulates, without flagging 
the appetite. 

To Color Soups. 

A fine amber color is obtained by adding finely- 
grated carrot to the clear stock when it is quite free from 
scum. 

Eed is obtained by using red skinned tomatoes from 
which the skin and seeds have been strained out. 

Only white vegetables should be used in white soups, 
as chicken. 

Spinach leaves pounded in a mortar, and the juice 
expressed, and added to the soups, will give a green color. 

Black beans make an excellent brown soup. The 
same color can be gotten (by adiding burnt .sugar or 
browned flour to clear stock. 

Velvet Soup. 

One quart of any kind of good -white stock, one-half 
cup cream, season to taste and pour boiling hot on the 
beaten yolks of four eggs, diluted with one-half cup 
cream. Reheat and serve at once in bouillon cups. 

To Make Clear Soup, Bouillon and Chowder. 

A real consomme is a perfectly clear dinner soup, to 



26 Model House-keeper. 

he made from 'beef andi veal; follow the directions for 
m'aking stock. 

Bouillon, a luncheon soup, is a clear soup made from 
lean c'hopped beef. Use a quart of water to each pound 
of meat. It is served in cups, eaten with a dessert or 
bouillon spoon — never with a teaspoon. A clear, 
strong stock may be seasoned and served either as con- 
somme or bouillon. 

Bellevue bouillon is made from equal quantities of 
clear chicken broth and clam bouillon, slightly seasoned 
with celery-seed and pepper. This is served in bouillon- 
cups, with a tablespoonful of whipped cream on the top. 
■Grarnish with just a dash of paprika, and serve with it 
breadsticks or wafers. 

Gumbo, a thick soup made from okra, tomatoes, 
chicken stock and file (powdered sassafras leaves), is 
usually flavored with a small quantity of ham-water, o^ 
chopped or grated 'ham. 

Chowders are thick soups made from fish, oysters, 
clams or meat, and vegetables. They are served in soup- 
plates and eaten with a tablespoon. They take the place 
of both soup and meat; with a salad, wafers and cheese 
and coffee the dinner is complete. 

Scotch broth, a nice dinner soup, is made by cook- 
ing together a neck of mutton, or a knudkle of veal, with 
barley or rice. 

An old-fashioned cockie-leekie, a dinner in a single 
pot, makes a delightful change from the ordinary rou- 
tine. Put a fowl into the stock-pot, add three bunches 
of leeks, or two dozen small onions, and sufficient cold 



Soups, 27 

water to cover the fowl ; bring to a 'boil and skim. Add 
half a cupful of pearl barley that has 'been thoroughly 
washed and scalded, cover the kettle, simmer gently two 
hours, or until the chicken is tender. Have ready, boil- 
ed and d^ied, half a pound of rice; shake it on the 
bottom of a meat platter, place the chicken in the center, 
pour over this half a pint of well-made egg sauce, and 
sprinkle with chopped parsley. Thicken the soup with 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour, rubbed to- 
gether. When boiling season with salt and pepper. 
Serve in an old-fashioned .soup^pot, if you have one; if 
not use the ordinary soup tureen. The chicken and rice, 
with lettuce and French dressing, form the dinner that 
follows the soup. Use a fowl, not a chicken ; it would be 
extravagant, indeed, to pay a high price for tender meat? 
for soup. 

Potato Soup. 

Potato soup is suitable for a cold day. Make it in the 
following manner : Get as many beef or ham -bones as 
yon can, and smash them into fragments. Add a little 
bit of lean ham to give flavor. Boil the bone and ham 
for two hours and a half at least. The bone of a roast 
beef is excellent. Strain off the liquor carefully, empty 
the bones and debris of the ham, restore the liquor to the 
pot, and place again on the fire. Having selected, wash- 
ed, and pared some nice potatoes, cut them into small 
pieces, and boil them in the stock till they melt away. 
An onion or two may also be boiled among the bones 
to help the flavor. I do not like thick potato soup, and 



28 Model Housekeeper. 

I usually strain it through a hair sieve, after doing so 
pdacing it again on the fire, seasoning it with pepper 
and salt to taste. A stick of celery boiled with the hones 
is an improvemjent. Make only the quantity required 
for the day, as potato soup is best when it is first made. 

Oyster Soup. 

Two quarts of oysters, one quart of milk, two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, one teacupful hot water; pepper, 
f'alt. 'Sitrain all the liquor from the oysters ; add the cold 
water and heat. When near the boil, add the seasoning, 
then the oysters. Cook about five minutes from the 
time they begin to simmer, until they "ruffle." Stir in 
the butter, cook one minute "and pour into the tureen. 
Stir in the boiling milk, and send to table. 

Bomllon. 

For receptions or other large panties. It is simply 
beef tea on a large scale and should be prepared like a 
plain soup stock, allowing 1 pound of meat and bone 
to each pint of water. 'Season with pepper, salt, celery 
and onion, if liked. It is best madie the day before it is 
served. Set on ice over night, remove every atom of 
grease, strain and clear according to the directions giv- 
en, and serve hot or iced. 

White Stock Soup. 

Six pounds knuckle of veal, half pound lean bacon, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed in one of flour, two 
onions, two carrots, two turnips, three cloves stuck in 



Soups. 29 

an onion, one blade of mace, bunch of herbs, six quarts 
of water, pepper and salt, one cup of boiling milk. 

Cut up the meat and crack the bones. Slice carrots, 
turnips, and one onion, leaving that with the cloves 
whole. Put on with mace, and all the herbs except the 
parsley, in two quarts of cold water. Bring to a slow 
boil ; ta'ke off the scum, as it rises, and at the end of an 
hour's stewing, add the rest of the cold water — one gal- 
lon. Cover and cook steadily, always gently, four hours. 
Strain off the liquor, of which there should be about five 
quarts; rub the vegetables through the colander, and 
pick out bones and meat. Season these highly and put, 
as is your Saturday custom, into a wide-mouth jar, or 
a large bowl. Add to them three quarts of stock, well 
salted, and, when cold, keep on ice. Cool to-day's stock ; 
remove the fat, season, put in chopped parsley, and put 
over the iire. Heat in a saucepan a cup of milk, stir in 
the floured butter ; cook three minutes. When the soup 
has simmered ten minutes after the las;t boil, and been 
carefully skimmed, pour into the tureen, and stir in the 
hot, thickened milk. 

Consomme. 

Three pounds beef, lower part or round, 1 lb. of 
marrow bone, three lbs. knuckle of veal, three quarts 
water, one-fourth cup each, cut in dice: carrot, turnip, 
celery, onion; one tablespoon salt, six peppercorns, three 
cloves, two sprigs thyme, two sprigs parsley, one-half 
bay leaf. Cut the beef in one-inch cubes and brown one- 
half of this in fat from the marrow bone. Put remain- 



30 Model Housekeeper. 

ing one-half in kettle with, cold water and salt, add veal 
cut in pieces, browned meat 'and bones. Let stand one 
hour. Heat slowly to the boiling point, let simmer six 
hours, removing scum as it forms on surface. Sicald 
the vegetables and add with the seasonings the last hour 
of cooking. Strain, cool quickly, remove fat, and clear. 

Egg Balls For Soup. 

Boil four eggs ; put into cold water ; mash yolks with 
yolk of one raw egg, and one teaspoonful of flour, pep- 
per, salt and parsley ; make into balls and boil two min- 
utes. 

Noodles For Soup. 

Rub into two eggs as much sifted flour as they will 
absorb ; then roll out until thin as a wafer ; dust over a 
little flour, and then roll over and over into a roll, cut 
off thin slices from the edge of the roll, and shake out 
into long strips; put them into the soup lightly and boil 
for ten minutes; salt should be added while mixing with 
the flour — about a saltspoonful. 

Forcemeat Balls. 

Two-thirds cup lean veal or chicken, one-half cup 
stale bread crumlbs, onei-half cup milk, two tablespoons 
butter, one Q^g white, one-fourth teaspoon salt, few- 
grains pepper, few grains nutmeg. 'Cook bread and 



Soups, 31 

milk to a paste, add melted butter and egg white stifly 
beaten, and seasonings. Pound meat and add to the 
mixture. Then force all through a coarse strainer. Form 
into almond-shaped balls between two spoons. Cook ten 
minutes in stock that must only simmer. 

Ham Dumplings. 

Proceed as above, using lean ham with parsley or a 
few drops of onion juice; leave out salt and nutmeg. 
Chop fine and pound to a paste. Shape in larger balls 
and cook in stock. They should be as light as sponge 
and may be served in consomme. 

S(mp Garnisliings — Croutons. 

Cut one-third inch slices of stale buttered bread, 
from which crusts have been removed, into one-half inch 
cubes, brown in oven. 

Imperial Sticks. 

Ctit one-third inch slices of stale buttered bread into 
three-fourth inch strips and brown in oven. 



In choosinjg beef it should be of a clear, bright red 
color, fine grain and smooth and should readily pinch 
tender with the fingers. The suet sihould be rather 
white in color, the choice pieces for roast is sirloin 
middle andj four ribs. 

In roasting meat allow from twenty to twenty-five 
minutes to the pound. A great deal of success in roast- 
ing depends on the heat. It should never be put in cold 
oven. It looses its juices and consequently a tough, 
tasteless roast. Always have oven real hot at first to 
sear the pores and retain the juices. Always wipe roast 
perfectly dry and place in baking ipan without water or 
seasoning of any kind; some pieces of suet or drippings 
sh\Duld be put in bottom of pan. Water has a tendency 
to soften surface of meat and generates steams which 
prevents its crispness. It Should be frequently basted 
with its own drippings; an onion sliced and put on top 
of any kind of meat while cooking gives it a good flavor 
but should be removed before serving. 

To' Keep Awcuy Flies. 
To keep meat from flies, put in thin muslin sacks 
with straw around all sides, bottom and top. Be sure 
the straw is all around the ham and thick enough so flie? 
cannot reach it to deposit their eggs. It must be done 
early, before the fly appears.

Blue Grass Steak. 

Get a nice thick steak, beat and hack well on both 
sides, salt, pepper and flour well both sides, also have 
skillet or pan very hot with about tablespoonful butter 
and tablespoonful lard mixed. Put steak in hot grease 
and put in real hot oven — the hotter the better — not to 
bum after flour browns on top; turn over and flour the 
sidie turned up again. Do this until you have turned 
and returned it several times, putting on c'onsiderable 
flour each time, as this forms a delicious crust on both 
i&ides of steak, and usually makes a nice brown gravy 
thick enough. Don't cook too long, but cook quickly 
and when real brown and hot pour over all a dipper 
nearly full of water and put on top immediately, and 
close oven door for it to steam. Let steam a few min- 
utes and take up in hot platter. If gravy is not thick 
enough add a little flour, cream and water until 
right consisteney. Let boil up again, then add to gravy 
a generous lump of butter. 

Roast Beef. 

Have the oven real hot when roast is first put in. 
This causes the pores to close and prevent the escape of 
juices. Take a loin or rib roast six or seven pounds, pur 
in pan with a little suet. In a little while you can baste 
in its own drippings, which you must; do often. When 
it is well seared lessen heat in oven and have a rather 
slow, even heat as this will make it tenderer. When 
about one-half done season well with salt, pepper and 



34 Model Hotiselceeper. 

flour over the top to give it a frothy appearance. To 
cook this a little rare in center will take about two 
hours, to be perfectly done about three hours. To make 
gravy, thicken with a little flour ; let brown, stirring all 
the time, then add water and let boil up once. 

Baked Steak. 

Have round steak as broad as possible, about one 
inch thick, salt and pepper. Make a dressing as for 
chicken or turkey of Ibread crumbs with lots of onions 
chopped fine. Form in roll and wrap up in steak; tie 
with strings. P'ut in saucepan with piece of suet. Mix 
a heaping tablespoon 'of butter, one of flour and a little 
pepper and salt, and about two cups of hot water. Pour 
over roll and let cook slowly about three-fourths of an 
hour. Take up meat, remove the string and pour over 
gravy. 

Creamed Sweet Breads. 

Take sweet breads that have been panbioiled, cut in 
small pieces and make a cream sauce of one cup cream, 
one tablespoonful butter, salt and pepper to taste, one 
cup hot water and pour over meat, boil with top on until 
tender, then thicken with a little flour, pour into deep 
meat dish and serve very hot. 

Meat Loaf. 

Put one piound each of lean beef and veal through a 
meat chopper, add four well-beaten eggs, one onion 
chopped fine, one cup bread crumtbs, tablespoon chopped

parsley, dash salt, pepper and nutmeg. Mould into loaf 
and place in baking pan ; cover surface with beaten eggs 
and bread crumbs. Put several slices of fat, sweet pork 
in pan and Ibake in moderate oven for forty minutes, 
basting often. 'Serve hot in loaf or cold sliced with bits 
of lemon. 

Broiled Steak. 

Have frying pan very hot, after you have hacked a 
thick steak a little on both sides (or some prefer it noi 
hacked) put in pan that has been greased iby rubbing 
over with cloth dipped in melted butter; turn almost as 
soon as put in to sear before losing any of its juices, foi- 
rare steak only requires one or two minutes^ cooking; 
done steak about five minutes or more, according to 
thickness. Gffave prepared a very hot dish with one-half 
teacup melted butter, black pepper and salt to taste. 
Take up in dish and leave on stove when almost boiling 
hot, and pour in pan where broiled two or three table- 
spoons of water, and pour over steak; keep turning steak 
in the hot butter gravy until ready to serve. iSend cov- 
ered steaming hot to table. This is delicious. 

To Fry Beefsteak. 

Beefsteak for frying should be thinner than for 
broiling, should be well hacked, salted, peppered and 
floured and put into hot skillet with two tablespoons 
butter and lard or drippings, mixed; turn and fry nice 
brown on both sides. Make gravy by putting in heaping 
tablespoon of flour, stirring until a delicious brown.

Pour in this a pint of cream or rich sweet milk, and let 
boil until it thickens; add salt and pepper to taste, and 
stir in a lump of butter just before pouring into a gravy 
dish.

Flanlc Steak. 

Is a small steak cut from the boneless part of flank. 
There are two ways of broiling it; one to slice it diag- 
onally across the grain, the other is to broil it whole. In 
either case brush butter over it and broil as other steakp. 
It is considered by butchers the finest steak. 

Fried Liver. 

Out in slices not quite half inch thick ; pour over it 
boiling water which closes pores, makes it imlpervious to 
the fat and seals up the rich juice of meat. It may be 
rolled in flour, meal or bread crumbs, seasoned with salt 
and pepper, dipped in egg and fried in butter and lard 
mixed. 

Beef Hash.

To fry breakfast bacon to perfection, cut very thin 
and thoroughly chill on ice. Wipe perfectly dry, have 
pan smoking hot and turn soon as brown, draining ofl' 
grease as it cooks to keep it crisp. Serve on hot dish 
sprinkled over with pepper. C^ut a few nice tart apples

mer, by speaking to your butcher a fiew diays in ad- 
vance. Get two nice hog livers, (beef liver is too solid), 
and the pork liver is nice and grainy, which is very de- 
siraible in making this stew. 'Cut up in pieces about 
three inches long and two inches wide, put on and cov- 
er well with boiling water, add a teaspoon of soda and 
skim often at first; after this has boiled for one-half 
hour take up and wash and rinse out pot and return to 
pot and cover with fresh 'boiling water. Have about 
three-fourth pounds of rather fat fresh pork cut up in 
pieces a little smaller than liver, and put in pot as soon 
as water is changed; put in now about one tablespoon 
salt, a little red pepper and cover and let cook until 
liver is thoroughly tender and about all water cooked 
down to clear grease. You may have to add water once 
or twice before done, but cook low as possible not to 
scorch, and be sure that very little water remains. 
When it is thoroughly done add three-fourths pint 
of cream, a tablespoonful of mashed-up sage and 
thicken gravy with little flour made smooth with water. 
Serve hot, either with gravy poured over or served in 
separate bowl. 

Cold Boiled Ham. 

Clean nicely and soak in cold water over night. Cover 
with cold water and put on to Iboil. Let boil very slowly 
for one-half hour, then change water and cover with 
fresh water, to which add) one and one-half teacup of 
brown sugar, one pod' of red pepper, about one table- 



42 Model Hotiseheeper. 

spoonful of mixed spices, cloves, mace, etc., tied up in 
thin cloth. Let this cook, or rather simmer, at boiling 
point nearly all day, or until ham is thoroughly tender. 
Most amateurs are easily mistaken about this and take 
their hams off long before ttiey are sufficiently cooked. 
Leave to cool in water in which it is cooked; skin and 
grate over bread crumbs and brown slightly in oven 
next morning. Never cut a ham until it has been 
cooked from 24 to 36 hours. This gives it chance to 
settle and harden and become firm. Always begin to 
cut a ham at small end; never in the middle as some 
people do. 

To Fry Ham. 

Slice and roll thin, put on ice and have very cold; 
wipe dry, wipe pan out with cloth dipped in melted 
butter; have pan smoking hot. If pieces are large, fry 
one at a time and empty out every particle of grease as 
it fries out so as to have pan as dry as possible when 
each slice is put in. Fry brown and turn and take up 
on hot platter. Siprinkle witli pepper, and as last piece 
is taken out, leave what greast is left in pan from that 
piece and add a little hot water to pan and let boil up 
and pour over ham. 

Broiled Ham. 

Prepare ham in same way as to fry, and broil over 
live coals or on broiler; put on hot platter and butter 
generously and sprinkle with pepper.

Ham Toast. 
Ohop some lean ham fine, put it in a pan with a 
little pepper, a lump of ibutter andl two eggs beaten; 
when well warmed, spTead on hot buttered toast and 
serve. 

Breakfast Dish. 

Chop cold steak very fine ; cook it in a very little wa- 
ter ; add a few tablespoonfuls of cream ; thicken and sea- 
son with butter, pepper and salt; pour over slices of 
nicely browned toast. 

lAver and Bacon. 

iCut liver in one-half-inch slices, soak in cold water 
20 minutes, drain, dry, and roll in flour. Have pan 
very hot. Put in bacon thinly sliced, turn until brown, 
transfer to hot platter. Fry liver quickly in the hot fat, 
turning often. (When done pour off all but one or two 
tablespoons fat, dredge in flour until it is absorbed, and 
stir till brown. Add hot water gradually to miake smooth 
gravy, season and boil one minute. 'Serve separately. 
Few people know that lamib's liver is as tender and well 
flavored as calf s liver; it is much less expensive. 

Fried Salt Pork. 

Out salt pork in thin slices and soak in milk for a 
few hours. Pour boiling water over, drain, and fry un- 
til crisp. 'When partly fried they may be dipped into 
batter (see Fritters), then finished in the same pan, 
turning several times.

To Cool- Tough Meat. 

All kinds of poultry and meat can be cooked' quicker 
by adding to the water in which they are boiled a little 
vinegar or piece of a lemon. By the use of an acid 
there will Ibe considerable saving of fuel as well as short- 
ening of tim'e. Its action is beneficial on old, tough 
meats, rendering them quite tendier and easy to be di- 
gested. Tainted meats and fowls will lose their bad 
taste and odor if cooked in this way, and' if not used 
too freely, no taste of it will be acquired. 

Scraps. 

To use up cold meats, take pieces of any kind, chop 
fine, season with pepper and salt, a little onion chopped, 
break over the meat two or three egga, add a small piece 
of butter, stir all together in a pan over the fire, with a 
little cream or water to moisten — thin gravy does very 
nicely; pour it upon nicely^buttered toast; serve hot. 

Shepherd's Pie. 

A pound of mrutton, minced fine, or any scraps of 
cold meat can be minced and used for this dish. Two 
and a half pounds of potatoes boiled and peeled. Mash 
the potatoes with a little milk until quite smooth, and 
add a little salt and butter. Put the meat into a deep 
pudding dish, season with pepper and salt. If cold meat 
is used, add a very little stock or water just to moisten 
it. Cover the minced meat over with the potatoes. Make 
it look as neat and as much like a real pie as possible, 



Meats. 45 

and bake in gentle oven for half an hour until the po- 
tatoes are nicely browned. If liked, a finely-chopped 
onion can be added to the minced meat. 

Beef Heart With Dressing. 

Boil a goodi,9ized beef heart in salt water until it is 
nearly tender. Then split partly and put in this dress- 
ing; soak four or five slices of rye 'bread in water, then 
squeeze out until dry with the hand. Pry one onion cut 
in very small pieces in a litle butter, put in a sprig of 
parsley cut fine, a little paprika (red pepper from Hun- 
gary, five cents the box), salt and pepper, one teaspoon- 
ful of butter and fry until brown. Fill heart with this. 
Place in hake pan, siprinkle flour and a little butter on 
top of hea'rt in pan ; put a half pint of water for gravy, 
and bake a half hour when it will he light-brown, then 
serve. 

Lyonnaise Tripe. 

Boil the tripe in salted water, unless, as is often the 
case, it has been boiled before it was sold. €ut it in 
long, narrow strips. Put a tablespoonful of butter in 
the pan, and when it browns add a small onion, cut into 
bits. When this has browned, add a tablespoonful of 
vinegar, the tripe, a little chopped parsley, salt and pep- 
per to taste. If the pickled tripe is used, omit the vine- 
gar, called for in the recipe. 

Gravy For Roast Meats. 

Save all the nice bits of roast in a jar for the pur- 



46 Model Housekeeper. 

pose — then you are neyer at a loss for gravies ; take some 
of these pieces and cut them very small, and put them 
into a saucepan ; pour over them one pint of boiling wa- 
ter; let it simmer very slowly, tightly covered, for an 
hour; strain through a sieve, and add this to melted or 
4rawn butter. Send to table in a sauce-boat. A careful 
cook will always save all the meat gravies left, and have 
a vessel for keeping them. 

Tough Steak. 

Tough steak may be rendered more tender by plac- 
ing for two hours in a dish containing three tablespoon- 
fuls of vinegar and salad oil or butter, a little pepper, 
but no salt; turn every twenty minutes. Oil and vine- 
gar soften the fibers without extracting the juices. 

Fine Beef Jelly. 

An excellent food for invalids and convalescents. Put 
a pound of lean beef, cut fine, into a poTcelain-lined 
stewpan with a pint of cold water. Let it stand half an 
hour, and then put it on the stove, where it will heat 
gradually. While boiling hot skim carefully, and put 
it where it will simmer gently for half an hour. When 
this is cooking, put a third of a box of gelatine in two 
tablespoonfuls of cold water, stirr till dissolved. Add 
this with salt to taste to the broth and strain into cups 
or molds. Set away to cool.

ground together in a meat chopper. To this add twelve 
teaspoons of powdered sage, six each of black pepper and 
salt, two teaspoons each of ground cloves and mace and 
a grated nutmeg. Mix well, pack all in stone jars and 
pour melted fat on top to exclude air. 

Smoked Beef Savory. 

Heat a cupful of rich milk and put with it one 
tablespoonful of butter, letting this melt. Shred a cup- 
ful or more of dried beef, turn it into the milk and 
cook a few minutes. Then add two beaten eggs, not 
allowing these to curdle, and stir until the sauce is thick. 
Put in red pepper — no salt unless absolutely needed — 
and serve on toast or hot crackers. 

Roast Beef. 

A standing roast is one with ribs left in. A rolled 
roast is one with the ribs removed, the meat rolled and 
tied. The tip of the sirloin is considered one of the 
best pieces for roasting. Then pan and rack should both 
be hot. Wipe and rulb the joint with salt and pepper 
and dredge with flour. Have the oven hot for the first 
ten or fifteen minutes to sear the surfaces. Eeduce heat, 
add water to cover the bottom of the pan and baste ev- 
ery fifteen minutes if a self-basting roaster is not used. 
Let the water cook away toward the last. After the 
meat is done remove this to a hot platter. Add one 
pint of hot water to sediment left in the pan after the 
fat has been poured off, place on the stove and scrape 
all the glaze from the bottom and sides of the pan. 



48 Model Ho'uselceeper. 

When it boils add a thickening madie of two teaspoons 
flour rubbed smooth with four tablespoons of cold water, 
pouring it in slowly. B'oil well, add salt and pepper 
to taste, and strain into a hot sauce bowl. 

Creamed Bacon. 

This dish is excellent for breakfast on a winter 
morning. C*ut the bacon in thin slices, cover it with 
milk and let it stand for about twenty minutes. Then 
remove it fromi the milk and roll each piece in flour. 
Crrease a very hot pan with a tiny piece o^f fat and put 
the bacon in it. Let it fry till crisp and brown. Then 
place it upon a hot platter and pour over it a cream 
sauce prepared from the milk that the bacon was soaked- 
in. The cream sauce should be boiling hot. Decorate 
with parsley and serve immediately. 

Yeal Cutlets. 

Two or three pounds of veal cutlets, Qgg and bread 
crumbs, two talblesipoonfuls of minced savory herbs, salt 
and pepper to taste, a little grated nutmeg. Cnt the 
cutlets about three-quarters of an inch in thickness, flat- 
ten them, and brush them over with the yolk of an egg ; 
dip them into bread crumbs and minced herbs, season 
with pepper and salt and grated nutmeg, and fold each 
cutlet in a piece of buttered paper. Broil them, and send 
them to table with melted butter or a good gravy.

ham, two hard boiled eggs, two tahlespoonfuls of minced 
parsley, a little pepper, good gravy, or stock. 
Cut off all the brown.' outside from the veal, and cut the 
eggs into slices. Procure a pretty mold; lay veal, ham, 
eggs, and parsley in layers, with a little pepper between 
each, and when the mold is full, get some strong stock, 
and fill up the shape. Bake for one-half hour, and when 
cold, turn it out. 

Roast Loin of Mntton. 

Loin of mutton, a little salt. Cut and trim off the 
superfluous fat, and see that the butcher joints the mea^ 
properly, as thereby much annoyance is saved to the 
carver, when it comes to table. Have ready a nice clear 
fire (it need not be a very wide, large one), put down 
the meat, dredge with flour, and baste well until it is 
done. 

Broiled Mutton Chops. 

Loin of mutton, pepper and salt, a small piece of 
butter. Cut the chops from a well -hung, tender loin 
of mutton, remove a portion of the fat, and trim them 
into a nice shape ; slightly beat and level them ; place the 
gridiron over a bright, clear 'fire, rub the bars with a lit- 
tle fat, and lay on the chops. AVliile broiling, frequent- 
ly turn them, and in about eight minutes they will be 
done. JSeason with pepper and salt, dish them on a very 
hot dish, rub a small piece of butter on each, chop, and 
serve very hot and expeditiously.

Mutton Chop Fried. 

Cut some fine mutton chops without mucii fat, ruh 
over both sidles with a mixture of salt and pepper, dip 
them in wheat flour or rolled crackers, and fry in hot 
lard or beef drippings ; when both sides are a fine brown, 
take them on a hot dish, put a wineglass of hot water in 
the pan, let it become hot, stir in a teaspoonful of 
browned flour, let it boil up at once, and serve in the 
dish with the meat. 

For Curwg Hams. 

This recipe is by a Kentuckian who is even noted 
abroad, for liis delicious hams. When the meat is tak^u 
up to be dried], wash it in clean, hot water and while 
damp sprinkle powdered borax all over the fleshy side 
of every piece and you need never have any fear of skip- 
pers or insects of any kind', although the hams hung in 
smoke house until cured without even a sack on them. 
If the sumimer is very dry I rewash and put on more 
borax in July and August. The taste of the meat is not 
injured, but when ready for use they will be found juicy 
and sweet. Each ham may be tied up in a canvas or 
paper bag, or they may be left hanging in a cool, dry 
place. Shoulders may be cured in the same way. 

Boiling Meat. 

The toughest piece of beef, neck or brisket, if the ani- 
mal furnishing it was flavorous, may be made perfectly 
delicious by long, slow boiling. Put the meat into boil- 



Meats. 51 

ing water and let it boil hard for two or three min- 
utes only. This toughens all the outside of the meat, so 
that a shell is formed, like a crust on a loaf, whicli 
holds the Juices of the meat. Then remove from the 
fire and set on the back of the range, keeping it as near 
180 degrees Fahrenheit as possible. When done, take 
from the stove and let the meat cool in the liquor it was 
boiled in. This process applies to all meats cooked by 
boil in 2*. 



O" 



Recipe For Curing Meat. 

To one gallon of water, take one and one-halt* pounds 
salt, one-half jwund sugar, one-lialf ounce saltpetre, one- 
half ounce ])otash. In this ratio tlie pickle can l)e in- 
creased to any quantity desired. Boil them together un- 
til all the dirt from the sugar rises to the top and is 
skinned off. Then let it cool, and pour it over your 
beef or pork. The meat must 1)e well covered with the 
]>ickle, and should not be put down for at least two 
days after killing, during which time it should be 
slightly sprinkled with powdered saltpetre, which re- 
moves all the surface blood, ets., leaving the meat fresh 
and clean. If this recipe is strictly followed it will re- 
(piire only a single trial to prove its superiority over the 
common way. The meat is unsurpassed for sweetness, 
delicacy, and freshness of color. 

Famous Recipe for Curing Hams. 

The following is the famous recipe used by Mrs. 
Henry Clay for curing hams, several hogsheads of which 



52 Model Housekeeper. 

wore annually sent to Boston, where, under the name of 
^^Ashland Hams/^ they commanded the highest of 
prices, especially among the wealthy Whigs of that city : 
For every ten hams of moderate size she took three and 
one-half pounds of fine salt, one pound of saltpetre and 
two pounds of Ibrown sugar, and after mixing these thor- 
oughly together, ruhbed the hams therewith on either 
side. They were then packed in a tight box and placed 
in a cool outhouse for about three weeks, when the 
hamis were taken out and put in a pickling tub or hogs- 
head and covered with brine strong enough to swim an 

After remiaining in the pickle for about three weeks 
they were taken out, thoroughly rubbed with fresh salt 
and hung up in a well-ventilated house for a few days 
to dry. Naxt they were transferred to the smokehouse, 
where they were hung up and smoked with green hick- 
ory or walnut wood until they acquired the color of 
bright mahogany. This accomplished, each ham was 
sewed up in a canvas, the coverings whitewashed and 
hung up to dry, after which they were whitewashed 
again and packed away.

All poultry should be nicely carved before sending to 
table. Pile up pieces high in center of dish with small 
balls of dressing placed around mound of chicken, and 
pass dish around so each one can get his or her choice 
piece. 

Hints on Carving. 
To carve a fowl remove a slice of the breast on either 



GO Model Hotiseheeper. 

side of the breast bone ; next cut off the wings, then the 
legs, cutting through the joint at the back and separat- 
ing the drumstick from the remainder of the leg, and 
finally divide the back in two. All game birds are carved 
practically in the same way as a chicken, only remember 
that with a woodcock some people consider the back the 
best part, others the thigh. 

Chicken Pivau. 

(Ivindness of Percy.) 
Dress and cut up two chickens, cover with water and 
cook until tender. Take out the chicken and boil a 
pint of rice in the water in which the chicken was cook- 
ed. Butter a large pudding dish, put half the boiled rice 
in the bottom, spread with butter and cover with the 
chicken; put in a gravy or stock that is left in the pot, 
then the rest of the rice, and smooth this on top with a 
knife. Beat the yolks of two eggs lightly and spread on 
top of the rice. Bake in a moderate oven for three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Roast Ducldings. 

Draw and singe, tuck the wings back and fasten the 
legs diown to the side of the body. Put a tablespoonful 
O'f butter in each duck, place them in a baking-pan, add 
half a cupful of water and a little salt to the pan, bake 
in a quick oven fifteen minutes; when done, take up, 
serve with onion sauce and currant jelly.

Stuffing. 

Can be made of bread, oysters, celery and onions. 
Take about one quart bread lightly broken up, about 
three days old'^ add a little salt, pepper, sage and chopped 
onion; moisten with several spoonsful broth skimmed 
from top where fowl w-as cooked ; mix very light with a 
fork and handle as light as possible. Don't mash. 

For oyster dressing leave out onions and mix in one- 
half pint raw oysters and for celery dressing chop up 
fine about one teacupful of celery, iseed will substitute ; 
fill hen and make a few small balls around hen when 
haking; a little larger than eggs, a few hard-boiled eggs 
peeled and mix with balls of dressing looks nice laid

boiling water and boil as fast as possible for about tli-riy 
mdnutes to close pores and retain juices, then put on a 
part of stove when it will just barely simmer very gent- 
ly until the poultry is cooked to tenderness. Add a slice 
of onion to water, and if the fowl is old addi two table- 
spoons of vinegar, or lemon juice will make it much 
tenderer. Place in stove pan, anrl fill with any kind .^f 
dressing preferred; dredge widl wilh Hour and) pour ov- 
er the licpior left from boiling. Bake in hot oven, tu idl- 
ing until all sides, back and all ar(^ a rich bro^vn ; l)aste

Chicken Fie. 

Cut up frying size cliickeiis, let lay in salt over 
night, wash and put in to boil with little pepper, salt, 
and slice of sweet bacon. Boil in just enough water to 
cover until very tender. Line pie dish with paste crust 
and lay in cooked chicken and pour over dressing made 
of one pint rich milk, butter size of large hen Qgg, thick- 
en like gravy, bake bottom crust before adding chicken 
to dressing, then pour all in and put on top crust and 
bake. The yelk of an Qgg beaten with two tablespoonsful 
of milk brushed over the outside crust of pie gives it a 
rich glazed look so desirable. 

Creamed Chicken. 

Cut up chicken, boil tender and pick from bones 
and grind. One tablespoonful of flour, one pint of cream, 
one-half cup of green peppers, salt, pepper and celery; 
salt to taste, melt butter and blend with flour. When 
thoroughly mixed add cream and seasoning. Cook until 
thick, then add ground chicken, then add peppers 
which have been parboiled and cut up fine. Serve in 
buttered patty shells or on nice brown toast. 



IFlsb. 

This is an important part of our food supply. The 
fresh fish is less stimulating and nourishing than meat 
but is considered more easily digested. Fish makes an 
agreeable change in the usual routine of a roast, broil, 
fry and boil. A notable advantage is the short time 
required to cook flsh^ another is the great variety of 
kinds through the long list of fresh and salt water, red 
or white fleshed, dry, salt or fresh. The white fleshed 
fish is more easily digested than the red fleshed. Ex- 
amples are whitefish, haddock, cod, flounder, perch, 
pickerel, croppies, etc. Elxamples of red fleshed fish 
are salmon, shad, lake trout, etc. Very large fish are, 
as a rule, better when boiled or steamed; medium sized 
ones should be baked or split and hroiled, and small 
ones fried. Eed fleshed fish being richer in fat should 
not be fried. 

A fish is in good condition when the eyes are 
bright, and gills a bright clear red, scales shiny, the 
flesh firm and free from a disagreeable odor. 

To Clean a Fish. 

Eemove the scales by scraping with a dull knife 
from the tail toward the head. Head and tail may be 
left on or removed according to the manner of cooking. 
Small fish to be served whole have the entrails removed 

64 



Fish. G5 

by opening under the gills and pressing out their con- 
tents with the thumb and finger; example, smelts. 
Larger fish are split half way down the belly and the 
insides scraped and! washed with salt and water after 
it is empty. Wipe the fish inside and out with a cloth 
wrung out of cold salted water, then wipe with a dry 
clean cloth. 

To Skin a Fish. 

First remove the fins along the back and cut oft' a 
narrow strip of skin the entire length of the hack. 
Loosen the skin over the bony part of the gills and 
slowly work toward the tail. Do the same on the other 
side. 

To Bone a Fish. 

Clean fish and remove head; beginning at ihQ tail, 
run sharp knife close to the backbone, cutting the meat 
away on one side and working toward the head. Turn 
and repeat on the other side. 

Boiled Fish. 

Clean the fish according to the directions, wipe care- 
fully and rub with salt. Wrap in .a piece of cheesecloth 
to hold the fish together and to prevent the scum from 
adhering to the fish. Place it in a kettle half filled with 
boiling water, cook slowly, allowing fifteen or twenty 
minutes to the pound. A long fish-kettle with a rack 1*3 
useful. A wire basket in a kettle may be substituted, 
the fish coiled about in the basket. The water in which 



66 The Model Househeeper. 

the fish cooks shouldi have salt and vinegar or lemon 
juice added, two teaspoons of salt and one of vinegar 
to a quart of water. The salt gives flavor, the vinegar 
or lemon juice keeps the flesh white. The fisb is cooked 
when flesh is firm and seprates easily from the bone. 
Take from the water and remove cheesecloth. Garnish 
with parsley and slices of lemon. 

Steamed Fish. 

iClean carefully but without removing head or fins, 
rub inside and out with salt and pepper and lemon 
juice, laying slices of onion inside if liked. Lay on a 
buttered paper and steam till the flesh falls easily from 
the bones. Lay on a folded napkin, garnish with lemon 
and parsley and serve with a Hollandaise sauce. 

Salmon is the best of the canned fish, and is capa- 
ble of being converted into many palatable and sightly 
dishes. It may be served cold with French dressing, or 
on lettuce leaves with mayonnaise dressing, as salmon 
salad. Or it may be mixed with breadcrumbs, nicely 
seasoned, rolled into small balls and fried. You can 
make it into croquettes by adding an equal quantity of 
very thick cream sauce — form in cylinders, dip in eg^ 
and bread crumbs and fry. Ot stir a can of salmon 
into half pint of cream sauce, add the yolks of four 
eggs, bake in a baking-dish, and you have salmon pud- 
ding. If you fold into this mixture the well-beaten 
whites of three eggs you have a salmon souffle. Or the 
can may be thrown into a kettle of hot water, boiled 
for half an hour, then opened, the salmon turned on 



Fih. 67 

a hot platter, garnished with fried potato balls and 
served with sauce HoUandaise as the second course for 
dinners, or as the fish course on fast-days. A small can 
of salmon carefully separated from the bones, oil and 
skin, rubbed to a paste, added to a quart of milk that 
has been heated and thickened with a tablespoonful of 
butter and two of flour rubbed together, and seasoned 
with salt, pepper, a little grated onion and a saltspoon 
of mace — this makes a delicious cream-of-salmon soup. 

Clean Fish. 

Fish can be cleaned much easier if just dipped in 
hot water. 

Baked Fish. 

Blue Salmon is a fine fish to bake, weighing from 
four to six pounds. It is best to soak in salt water for 
several hours. Make a dressing of bread crumbs sea- 
soned with salt, pepper, butter and a little chopped on- 
ion. Stuff fish and tie together, put in baking pan 
one-half pint of water and a couple of slices of sweet 
bacon laid across top of fish. Dredge with flour and 
put a heaping tablespoon of butter and baste frequently. 
Bake about one hour and a half, a nice brown. Garnish 
with parsley and rings of hard boiled eggs. Serve with 
sauce. 

Fish Sauce. 

Stir in one pint of drawn butter, the yolks of two 
eggs, well beaten, pepper, salt, and a few sprigs of pars- 
lay ; let it boil, and then pour over the fish when it is on 
the dish ready to be served. 



68 The Model Housekeeper. 

Fried Fish. 

Eemove head, tail and fins, and if you like the bones 
cut crosswise any size desired, wash thoroughly and let 
stand in very cold salt water for a while. If you like 
it first salted then dip in beaten egg diluted with a lit- 
tle milk, then in grated bread crumbs in which has 
been put a little pepper and salt. Dip in eggs again, 
then again in crumbs; some prefer meal to crumbs. Put 
three or four pieces at one time in frying basket and 
cook in deep 'fat, smoking hot ; drain on brown or blot- 
ting paper and serve on hot platter around a high 
mound of delicately cooked potato chips. Garnish with 
parsley. 

To Saute Fish. 

Cut as for fried fish and salt, pepper and roll in 
meal, cover bottom of skillet well with lard, and when 
sm'oking hot put in fish and cook a delicate brown on 
one side, and turn and brown other likewise; put in 
pan and set inside stove for a few minutes to dry out 
grease before serving; to be eaten with Kentucky corn- 
bread and drip coffee. 

Fish Balls. 

To one cup of boiled fish picked in pieces, mix half 
the amount of mashed and well-seasoned potatoes; 
make a cream sauce of one-half cup cream, one table- 
spoonful flour and butter; mix together with two well- 



Fish. 69 

beaten eggs, season with dash of cayenne pepper and 
salt. Make in balls about size of small lemon and dip 
in raw egg and roll in crumbs and fry in deep hot fat; 
drain on brown paper; serve on hot platter and garnish 
with parsley. 

Cod Fish Balls. 

Soak fish, changing water until fresh as desired. 
Pick to pieces; use one cup of fish to two cups of 
mashed, well-seasoned potatoes, one or two eggs beaten 
in well ; add a small quantity of cream, dash of salt and 
pepper; make in balls, roll in crumbs and fry in hot 
fat. 

Salt Mackerel. 

Soak fish until ready for use, changing water a* 
needed. Cover with boiling water for a minute; drain

sauce. 



Oysters are in season from September to May. Oys- 
ters are nutritious and are easily digested, especially 
when eaten raw. 

To Open Oysters. 

Insert a thin, sharp knife between the shells near 
the back, pushing the knife forward till it cuts the 
muscle which holds the two shells together. 

To Clean Oysters. 

Place the oysters in a strainer over a bowl. Reserve 
the drained liquor. Pick over each oyster carefully for 
bits of broken shell and wash in cold water, allowing 
two cups to each quart. The oyster liquor should al- 
ways be scalded and strained before using. For many 
purposes the oysters should be scalded before using. 
Place one pint of cleaned oysters in a frying basket and 
dip it for one minute in a kettle of boiling water, drain 
and dry on a soft cloth. 

Oysters on the Half Shell. 

Keep on ice till serving time. Have small soup- 
plates half full of fine ice and lay the oysters in the 
deep half of the shell on the plates as fast as opened. 
Salt, pepper and a cut lemon should be served at the 

71 



72 Tlic Model Ilomekeeper. 

side, and a true oyster lover will use no other sauce. 
Small oysters are preferred, and four to six are enough 
for each plate. 

Creamed Oysters. 

One pint oysters, one and one-half cup white sauce. 
Drain and clean the oysters, scald and strain the liquor; 
cook the oysters in the liquor until plump and the edges 
begin to curl, and drain; add to the white sauce. Add 
more seasoning if necessary. Let it h.eat to the boiling 
point and serve in Swedish timbales or in patty shells. 
It is nice used as a filling for short-cake, croustad or on 
toast. 

Oyster 8hort-Cake. 

Drain and clean one quart of oysters, scald and 
strain the liquor, cook the oysters in the liquor until 
plumb and edges curl. Cook one tablespoon of 
flour with three tablespoons of butter. When 
the mixture is light and creaany gradually turn upon it 
the boiling liquor and season with salt and pepper. Af- 
ter boiling up once stir in three tablespoons of cream, 
also the oysters. 'Stir over the fire one-half minute. 
Serve immediately. Have shoTtoake ready to fill. 

Roasted Oysters on Toast. 

Eighteen large oysters, one teasp'oon flour, one 
tablespoon butter, one-half cup cream, one- 
iialf cup oyster liquor, one-half teaspoon salt, three

Oysters. 73 

strain the oyster liquor. Scald the oysters in the li- 
quor. For the sauce, melt the butter, add the flour and 
seasonings mixed, stir until smooth, add the oyster li- 
quor slowly and cook until smooth, then add the cream 
and lastly the oysters. Pour over the toast and garnish 
with slices of lemon. 

Broiled Oysters. 

Take two dozen large oysters, cleaned, drained and 
dried in a soft cloth. iSprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Melt two ounces butter in a large frying pan, lay in one 
dozen, as soon as the last one is in, turn the first one 
and when all have been turned begin taking out; lay- 
ing them closely on a large buttered oyster broiler ; cook 
to a light brown over moderate fire. While these are 
browning the other dozen may be "set" in the butter. 
Have six rounds of toast on a hot platter; put four 
oysters on each, sprinkle on the butter in which they 
were stiffened and serve with lemon cut in eighths.

with salt and pepper, dip in Gold Medal flour, egg and 
cracker or stale bread crumbs, and fry in deep fat. 
Drain on brown paper. Serve on a hot, folded napkin, 
garnish with parsley and lemon. Fried oysters should 
be served immediately. It is better not to begin fry- 
ing until they are wanted than to delay serving. It is 
best to let them stand on ice before frying, and flatten 
with hand. Take oyster in one hand and give a quick 
slap with ball of right hand, which makes them appear 
larger. 

Oyster CocMail. 

Fill small, slender glasses about one-half full of 
crushed ice, put about half dozen blue points or other 
oysters to each glass and pour over sauce made in pro- 
portion to each tumbler as follows : one tablespoonf ul 
of strained tomato juice, two tablespoons of tomato

heaping tablespoonful of flour, stirring constantly until 
it bubbles, then pour in one-fourth pint of oyster li- 
quor, and one-fourth pint of cream; stir until boiling 
and thick; then drop in oysters and cook until plump 
and begin to ruffle; add a well-beaten egg, a very little 
at a time, stirring all the while; season with salt and 
pepper, cook just a minute after adding egg. This is 
enough sauce for one pint of oysters. Fill patty cases, 
which should be hot; oysters should be small. For cases 
make rich pastry, baking on outside of muffin rings; 
also bake small, thin rounds' for covers, fill patties, put 
on covers; serve hot immediately.

Flour and baking powder are the most essential 
things in all bread and cake baking, for with an in- 
ferior brand of either one cannot hope for perfect suc- 
cess, as both are conducive to good results. I would 
advise when possible to always use a brand made at 
Roller Mills, Winchester, Ky., called Kerr's Perfection. 
I have used it almost exclusively for many years and 
both my mother and myself have taken premiums on 
both bread and cakes made from this flour over many 
competitors. I believe by using this flour in con- 
nection with Eoyal Baking Powder and by following 
explicitly the recipes given in the following chapters 
one is sure of success. 

In all bread making flour, baking powder, salt, 
soda and sugar should always be sifted before using. 
To insure success in all baking, correct measurements 
are absolutely necessary and one should by all means 
])uy a regular measuring cup, either in glass or tin. 

Crumming Purposes. 

Light bread is best for crumming, but you may use 
crackers and also biscuits. 'Save all crusts and trim- 
mings from bread when making toasts and sandwiches ; 
also all left-over biscuit and crumbled crackers, and 
hang up in paper bag to dry, or if wanted for im-* 

7a 



Breads. 79 

mediate use, dry out in slow oven. Grind in meat 
grinder and if wanted very fine, sift. Dishes that re- 
quire an Qgg mixture to he dipped in before crumming, 
heat the eggs sufficiently to mix well the whites and 
yolks and dilute with milk or water, about two scant 
tahlespoonfuls to each Qgg. 

Salt Rising Bread. 

Scald (but not boil) at night one-half pint of milk 
and stir into this two tablespoonfuls of meal and one 
of flour, one tea&poonful of salf. Let stand until morn- 
ing when it should be raised up and light looking. 
Then next morning add to this ,a pint of lukewarm 
water and stir in enough flavor to make a stiff batter; 
add a small teaspoonful of salt and soda and table 
spoonful sugar, set this in a vessel of warm water and 
it will in a short while rise to twice its quantity, then 
it is ready to make up. This will mix up two and 
one-half sifters of flour, to which add a little salt and 
tablespoon of lard; make in loafs, set in warm place 
to rise and then bake. 

Potato Yeast Bread. 

Peel four or five potatoes, and slice, stir two table- 
spoonsful of meal with potatoes, and pour over one 
quart of boiling water. Prepare this at supper time, 
next morning d^ain from potatoes and stir in enough 
flour to make a stiff batter; add two teaspoons sugar, 
one of salt and one of soda; when rising is ready to 
make up let one pint of milk come to boil and pour 



80 The Model HouseTceeper. 

all over two and one-half sifters of flour that has been 
rubbed into one teacup of lard. Ivnead well, lest rise. 
and bake. 

Light Rolls. 

Dissolve one-half cake of Magic Yeast into one pint 
of warm water; stir in enough flour to make a stifT 
batter, add a pinch of salt and little sugar. Let stand 
eight or ten hours, then mix up flour with about three- 
fourth teacup of lard to make as many rolls as de- 
sired ; use yeast rising,- and take lukewarm water ; 
rinse out vessels yeast was in with lukewarm' water un- 
til flour is sufficiently wet; make into small rolls and 
set in warm place to rise; then bake. 

Hoi Bread. 

Always cut hot bread with very hot bread knife. 

Royal Baking Powder. 

There is nothing more essential in all baking than 
to be sure you use the very best baking powder, for 
an inferior brand of this article will not only spoil 
the most painstaking efforts, but is very injurious to 
digestion and poisonous to the entire system. From 
my own personal experience I can safely say that Royal 
Baking Powder is always sure, safe, and healthful, and 
certain of best results, and I advise its use exclusive 
of all others.

double boiler is best) and thickening with flour which 
has been previously mixed with cold water. Thicken to 
about the consistency of heavy cream and salt to taste. 
Cooked about ten minutes, add a generous piece of but- 
ter and pour over toast one layer at a time. Biscuits 
sliced thin or loaf bread may be used in the same 
way. 

Corn Meal Muffins. 

One pint corn meal, one-half pint flour, one egg, 
one teaspoonful salt, the same of soda, and enough 
sour milk to make a stiff batter. Bake in muffin ring;?,

one teacup sugar, one tablespoonful baking powder, 
one teaspoonful lemon or vanilla, one cup cornmeal, 
one cup flour. Add two tablespoonfuls of boiling 
water. 'Stir quickly; pour into shallow pans and bake 
quickly. For filling, grate half a cup of green corn, 
put on stove with a cup of sweet milk; when boiling

and baked properly should melt in your mouth. Can 
be mad'e with buttermilk instead of sweet by adding 
one-half teaspoon soda. Don't leave out baking powder. 

Baking Pan Bread. 

This same recipe can be put in baking pan from 
about one and one-half inch thick and cut in small 
blocks and is called Qgg bread. 

€orn Batter Cakes. 

Use same recipe as for muffins except use the but- 
termilk and soda and use two whole eggs and make 
batter just thin enough by adding a little more milk 
to run stiffly off spoon. Bake on hot greased griddle 
in little thin cakes and stack one on top of the other 
with a little melted butter poured on top each cake. 

Flannel Cakes. {With Yeast.) 

Heat a pint of sweet milk, and into it put two 
heaping tablespoonfuls of butter, let it melt, then add 
a pint of coM milk and the well-beaten yolks of four 
eggs — placing the whites in a cool place; also, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, fuor tablespoonfuls of home-made 
yeast, and sufficient flour to make a stiff batter; set it 
in a warm place to rise; let it stand three hours or 
over night; before baking add the beaten whites; bake 
like any other griddle-cakes. Be sure to make the batter 
stiff enoudi, for flour must not be added after it has 



Breads. 91 

risen, unless it is allowed to rise again. These, half 
corn-meal and half wheat, are very nice. 

Pop-Overs. 

Two cups of flour, two cups of sweet milk, two 
eggs, one teaspoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, 
bake in cups in a quick oven fifteen minutes. 'Serve 
hot with a sweet sauce. 

Remember in Flour Griddle Cakes. 

The batter must be thin, the cakes made small and 
not too thick — 'about a good one-eighth inch thick when 
baked — ibrowned, and neatly turned. The griddle must 
be merely rubbed with grease, not grease-soaked. This 
is highly important. Take a thick piece of salt pork 
on a fork, or a lump of suet in a piece of cheese-cloth, 
and rub lightly over the hot griddle and pour the bat- 
ter on immediately. 

Pancalces. 

One pint flour, six eggs, one saltspoon salt, one tea- 
spoon Royal Baking Powder, and milk to make a thin 
batter. Add the baking powder to the flour, beat the. 
whites and yolks of eggs separately; add the yolks, salt, 
two cups milk, then the whites and the flour alternately 
with milk, until the batter is of right consistency. Eun 
one teaspoon lard over the bottom of a hot frying-pan, 
pour in a large ladleful of batter, and fry quickly. Roll 
pancake up like a sheet of paper, lay upon a hot dish, 
put in more lard, and fry another pancake. Keep hot

teaspoons Eoyal Baking Powder, one teaspoonful salt, 
one tablespoon brown sugar or molasses. 'Sift well to- 
gether, in dry state, buckwheat, Indian meal, wheat 
flour, and baking powder, then add remainder; when 
ready to bake add one pint water or sufficient to form 
smooth batter that will run in a stream (not too thin) 
ifrom pitcher; make griddle hot and cakes as large as 
a saucer. When surface is covered with air-holes it 
is time to turn cakes over; take off when sufficiently 
browned. 

Gem Pans. 

When filling gem pans with batter remember to 
leave one empty and fill with water. When this is done 
they will never scorch. 

Cornmeal Mush. 

Ptit on water according to quantity wanted, let 
come to boil, add salt to taste; take, say about one and 
one-half pints cornmeal, mix with enough cold salt 
water to make a medium thin batter, stir this grad-

96 The Model Honsekeeper. 

Eiat. >Bnish over the biscuit with an egg, lay them on 
a floured tin and bake in a hot oven to very pale brown. 
Any stale bits of cheese may be pleasantly used in this 
way. 

Crusts. 

In making a crust of any kind do not melt the 
lard in the flour. Melting will injure the crust. 

Brewis. 

Break stale pieces of brown and white bread into 
smaller pieces, allowing one and one-half cupfuls of 
brown bread to one-half cupful of white bread. Butter 
a hot frying-pan, put in bread and cover with skim- 
milk or half each of milk and water. lOook until of

Never Failing Salt Rising Bread, 

Peel and cut in very thin slices a potato about the 
size of your fist, add to this two heaping tablespoonsful 
of meal, a heaping teaspoonful of sugar, level tea- 
spoon of salt; pour on this, stirring all the time one 
pint of boiling water and put in small stone jar or 
pitcher. Make this at noon and let stand any place 
in kitchen in summer till breakfast time next morning 
and then remove potatoes and add enough flour to 
make rather stiff batter; return to jar and put in 
vessel of warm water and let stand until it rises about 
one-half higher, then pour this into two and one-half 
patent lifters of flour to which has been added two level 
tablespoonsful of sugar, one level tablespoonful salt, 
one an done-half tablespoonfuls lard; if not sufficient 
3^east add warm milk and water mixed to- jar and 
rinse and pour in sufficient amount to make a rather 
stiff dough, work about thirty minutes until smooth 
and put in pans to rise in warm place. Bake in mod- 
erate oven. This never fails. 



Vegetables* 

Hints on Cooking Vegetables. 

First — 'Have them fresh as possible. Summer j 

vegetables should be cooked on same day they are 
gathered. Second — iLook them over and wash well, 
cutting out all decayed or unripe parts. Third — ^Lay 
them, when peeled, in cold water for some time before | 

using. Fourth. — Always let water boil before putting ! 

them in, and continue to boil until done. ' I 

Turnips. — ^Should be peeled, and boiled from forty i 

minutes to an hour. 

Beets. — iBoil from one to two hours; then put in ■ 

cold water and slip skin off. j 

Spinach. — ^Boil twenty minutes. ; 

Parsnips. — *Boil from twenty to thirty minutes. 

Onions. — 'Best boiled in two or three waters, add- 
ing milk the last time. ! 

String Beans. — ^Should be boiled one and one-half I 

hours. I 

i 
Shell Beans. — ^Require an hour. i 

Green Corn. — ^Boil twenty or thirty minutes. 

Green Peas. — ^Should be boiled in little water as j 

possible; boil twenty minutes. ' 

Asparagus. — Same as peas; serve on toast with 
cream gravy. 

99 



100 The Model Houselceeper. 

Winter iSquash. — ^Cut in pieces and boil twenty to 
forty minutes in small quantity of water; when done, 
press water out, mash smoioth, season with butter, pep- 
]>er, and salt. 

Cabbage. — 'Should be boiled from one to two hours 
in plenty of water,; salt while boiling. 

Asparagus on Toast. 

Have stalks of equal length, scrape lower ends; 
tie in small bunches with tape. 'Cook twenty to thirty 
minutes, according to size. Dip six or eight slices 
dry toast in asparagus liquor, lay on hot platter, place 
asparagus on them, and cover w4th a white or drawn 
butter sauce; in making sauce use asparagus liquor and 
water or milk in equal quantities. 

Baked Cabbage. 

Cabbages are cheap, and to make them palatable 
and eatable we should know of more ways of cooking 
than boiling. An exchange recommends the "baked" 
which is treated as follows : "Boil a firm ,white cab- 
bage for fifteen minutes in salted water; then change 
the water for more that is boiling and boil until tender. 
Drain and set aside until cool, then chop fine. Butter 
a baking-dish and lay in the chopped cabbage. Make 
a sauce in this way: Put a tablespoonful of butter 
in a pan; when it bubbles up well stir in one table- 
spoonful of flour; a;dd one-half pint of stock and one- 
half pint of water, both boiling. 'Stir until smooth; 
season to taste with pepper and salt, and mix well 



Vegetables. 101 

with it four tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. Pour this 
over thecabbage; sprinkle rolled cracker over it; do 
it with lumps of butter and place in a quick oven for 
ten minutes. This is almost as good as the more aristo- 
cratic cauliflower when cooked in the same manner." 

Green Corn Fritters. 

Grate one pint of sweet corn, salt to taste and add 
one well-beaten egg, one teacup of flour and enough 
sweet milk to make a batter suitable to fry on a grid- 
dle. 

Green Corn Pudding. 

Take half a dozen ears of sweet corn. With a 
sharp-pointed knife split each row of kernels and scrape 
from the ear; mix with the pulp two well-beaten eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one tablespoonful of 
melted butter, one saltspoonful of salt, half a pint of 
sweet milk, and one dozen of crackers rolled fine. Mix 
well and bake one hour, or till done. 

This pudding can be made of canned corn, but 
is not so nice. If canned corn is used it must be) 
pressed through a fine colander. 

Salsify. 

"The Pattern €ook Book" gives the following direc- 
tions for stewing oyster-plant or salsify: Wash thei 
roots with cold water using a rough, cloth, place then.*' 
in a kettle with plenty of boiling, salted water, and 
boil slowly for an hour, when they will be nearly done. 



102 The Model Hoixseheeper. 

Drain off the water; and when the roots are cool 
enough to handile, scrape off the dark skin. Cut them 
in slices, return to the kettle, add hot water, and sim- 
mer fifteen minutes. 'Drain again, nearly cover with 
milk, and thicken the milk to a cream with, a little 
flour that has been stirred to a paste with oold milk. 
Season to taste with butter, salt and pepper, and serve. 
To fry salsify, boil, scrape off the skin, slice, and fry 
like parsnips. 

Corn Peppers. 

Select firm, bell peppers, either green or red. Do 
not cut off the stems. Parboil them for fifteen or 
twenty minutes whole. Cut a slice out of the side of 
the pepper like a little window, remove all the seeds 
and the partitions found in the pepper. Have ready 
the following mixture : A dozen cars of corn grated, a 
talblespoon of butter melted, tahlespoon of cream, two 
beaten eggs, salt to tase. Fill each pepper with this 
mixture, tuck in the little slice or window, and bake 
in a quick oven. 

Boiled Corn. 

Fill an enamel or granite-iron pot with plenty of 
water to cover the amount of corn you intend to cook. 
Bring it to a boil, and have your corn husked, the ears 
broken in half if they are very long. Salt the water, 
drop the corn into it at boiling point, and boil briskly 
from five to eight minutes, if the corn is very young 
and tender — from eight to twelve if the kernels are 



Vegetables. 103 

very large. Eemove with a large skimmer, drain, wrap 
in a napkin or corn doiley and serve immediately. 
Corn cooked in an iron pot is very apt to turn dark, 
and if allowed to stand in the water at the back of the 
stove it will become soggy and tasteless. 

Raw Callage. 

A nice way to prepare raw cabbage is as follows : 
Select a firm, good head, chop finely in a bowl what 
you think will be needed, and to every quart add one- 
half teacupful of thick, sweet-cream ; two tablespoonfuls 
of strong vinegar or lemon juice; one cupful of white 
sugar and mix thoroughly. 

Asparagus. 

Asparogus is often served as a separate course, cold, 
as a salad, with a French dressing, or it may equally 
be so served hot, with the ordinary cream sauce or 
the following, which is better: Melt two ounces of 
butter in a saucepan and sift into it level tablespoonful 
of flour, stirring all the time; add a gill of cold milk, 
salt and pepper; when the sauce is smooth and thick 
pour in a gill of cream and teaspoonful of Tarragon 
vinegar or lemon juice; mix well and add one-half 
ounce of grated Parmesan cheese. Serve hot at once. 

Pea Patties. 

Make a very rich pie crust, working the dough very 
little. Cut with biscuit cutter after rolling the dough 
out as for pies. Fit the circular pieces into patty pans 



104 The Model Househeeper. 

and bake until lig<hrfc brown. Pour the liquid from a 
can of peas, wash them slightly, and put them over 
the fire with only enough water to keep them from burn- 
ing. Cook until dry. P'repare a white sauce as fol- 
lows : Three tablespoonfuls of butter and one heaping 
tablespoonful of flour. Mix well together and add one 
pint of hot milk and boil until thick. Place eadth 
crust on a small plate and fill with peas. Pour over 
the white sauce and serve hot. These are very ap- 
petizing and delicious, and will be sure to please all 
who like peas. 

Corn With Green Peppers. 

Take a few tender ears of corn cut from cob, cut 
in one-fourth inch squares four or five green or red 
sweet peppers, mix with corn and add a little water 
and three-fourths teacup cream, tablespoonful of but- 
ter, a little salt. Put on baking dish and bake light 
brown. The colored peppers with white corn make 
a pretty combination. 

String Beans. 

'String, break once and let stand in cold water for 
half hour. Put about three-quarter pound of fat 
bacon in about one-half gallon cold water, let this boil 
slowly for one-half hour then put in beans ! add a little 
salt and red pepper; boil rapidly until tender as slow 
cooking has a tendancy to make them mushy; cook all 
the while with just enough water to keep from sticking; 



Vegetables. 105 

cook out all water. R usually takes from two to three 
hours to cook beans. Serve with corn dodgers and 
onions with vinegar dressing. It also adds' to beans 
to out off an ear of tender corn and add to them about 
thirty minutes before taking up. 

Turnip Greens, 

The cleansing requires strictest attention. If they 
are not very fresh it is absolutely necessary to restore 
their crispness before cooking, else they will be tough. 
Lay them in a pan of cool, fresh water with a handful 
of salt and let them remain for an hour or more. The 
Kentucky way of cooking greens is with about one- 
and one-half pounds of jowl put on in cold water and 
cooked until a^out done and until water is very low. 
Then drain greens thoroughly and put in pot with 
meat on top, add a little salt and dash of cayenne 
pepper, boil very briskly until tender, to retain color. 
Cook very low. Serve with poached eggs and smashed 
potatoes. Greens are also nice cooked in salted water 
until tend'er, seasoned with cream, butter and pepper. 
String beans can also be cooked without meat and 
served in same way. 

Tomato Fritters. 

One pint tomatoes canned ot fresh, chopped fine 
and salted to taste ; one egg beaten together and mixed 
with tomatoes, one-half teaspoon soda dissolved in 
water, sufficient flour to make a smooth batter. Mix 



106 The Model Hotisekeeper. 

a little 'butter^ with lard and add last. Drop from spoon 
in very- hot fat and fry nice brown. 'Serve hot. 

Stewed Celery ^ 

Is an excellent winter dish, and is very easily cooked, 
wash thestalks thoroughly^ and boil in well-salted water 
till tender, which will be in about twenty minutes. 
After it is madie ready .as above, drain it thoroughly, 
place it on toasted bread', and pour over it a quantity 
of sauce. A sauce of cream, seasoned with a littlo 
mace, may be served over the celery. It may also be 
served with melted butter. 

Stuffed Egg Plant. 

iCut the e;gg- plant in two; scrape out all the inside 
and put it in a .saucepan with a little m'inced ham; 
cover with water and boil with salt; drain off the 
water; add two tablespoonfuls grated crumbs, table- 
spoonful butter, half a minced onion, salt and pepper; 
stuff each half of the hull with the mixture; add a 
small lump of butter to each, and bake fifteen min- 
utes. 

Stuffed Peppers. 

Ctit the top from red or green sweet peppers re- 
move inside, stand in salted water for awhile, drain 
and fill with any ktin'd of filling desired. Chipped 
chicken, veal, beef with onions, bread crumbs; season 
to taste with butter, salt, pepper and little beaten egg. 
A nice filling is of brains, rice, peas, etc. Put in pan 



Vegetables. 107 

with little stock of water, cover top with battei'ed 
crumbs. Babe about one-half hour. Serve with any 
kind of sauce prefered. 

Mushrooms. 

Wash and remove stems, about one pint mush- 
roojns. Peel and break in pieces, melt one-half tea 
cup butter and ,add mushrooms when real hot, season 
to taste with salt and pepper. Dredge well with flour.

difficult of all dishes to prepare. Cut the potatoes into 
any desired shape. Do not soak them in water. Put 
them — a few at a time — into a pan of moderately heat- 
ed fat; let them boil in the fat. Wlien the edges be-

slowly for fifteen minutes; then with a limber knife 
fold them over as you would an omelet and turn them 
on to a heated platter.

Smccl rotatoes. 

Sweet potatoes contain a goodly quantity of sugar 
ami some starch. In some sections of the country 
starch is developed to a greater degree than sugar; then 
the potatoes are mealy. But where they are rich in 
sugar they are just a little sticky — never quite dry. 
They must always be cooked in the skins. If they are 
to be browned in the oven l)oil them first, remove the 
skins, cut them into halves, put them into a baking- 
pan, pour over syrup, -or dust them with sugar, baste 
them with melted butter and brown slowly. Or they 
may be cut into thin slices, put into a baking-dish with 
a layer of sugar between each layer of potatoes; add a 
piece of butter, cover the dish and bake until trans- 
parent. Cold boiled sweet potatoes cut into slices and 
broiled are served under the name of '^grilled sweets."

namon and allspice to taste; mix well and place in an 
oven to bake for an hour. Eat hot. 

Por meats, fried, etc., cut raw potatoeiS. in al- 
most an}^ shapes, long, thin pieces, cubes, curls, strings, 
all of which can be put in smoking hot fat, and fried 
a delicate brown; drained on brown paper and served 
at once. They are not crisp if allowed to stand. 

Peel old potiatoes and scrape new ones, always drop 
immediately in cold water as soon as peeled to prevent 
discoloration. Wilted potatoes are much improved if 
allowed to stand in very cold water for a while. Al- 
ways select for each cooking potatoes as near one size 
as possible, and if too large, cut to about one size, li 
is best whenever possible to boil with jackets on as the 
most nutritious part of the potato lies nearest the skin, 
and is thrown away when potato is peeled. Peel off 
.skins after boiling and they can be mashed or cooked 
most any way preferred. 

It is a splendid idea to study what vegetable goes 
best with meat served. For instance, nothing goes as 
well with fish a.s potatoes.

"pickles anb (Tatsups. 

Should never be put in such vessels of tin, copper or 
brass, as the action of the acid on these metals often 
causes poisoning. 'G,ra,nitew.are or porcelain is best 
lor these purposes. Vinegar should never be boiled but 
a very few minutes as it reduces its strength. Always 
use in pickles the best cider op fruit vinegars. Alum 
in very small quantities makes pickles firm and crisp. 
A piece of horseradish put in pickles will make them 
keep sound much longer, especially tomatoes.

Waldorf Salad. 

This salaicl is a very simple one, and has become so 
popular merely through its name and use at the Wal- 
dorf, in New YoTk. It is composed of equal quanti- 
ties of celery and chopped, raw, sour apples, dressed 
with mayonnaise dressing. 

At that hotel it is seldo'm served as a course, being 
pieferred with game, and is in reality what is called 
a game salad. It is a favoirite custom, more often 
aidopteid at ^^staig dinners" than elsewheire, to serve the 
salad with the game instead of as a separate course. 

Mayonnaise of String Beans. 

Trim a pint of very young, tender beans, put them 
in a saucepan, cover with boiling salt water and cook 
until tender; drain, throw in ice-water until very cold, 
dry on a soft towel, cut in pieces, arrange on a salad- 
dish, co^^Awith mayonnaise dressing, let stand on ice 
one hoiui^and serve.

napkin or linen doily; garnish with pim-olas or olives.

Pimento Sandwich. 

Use one can of pimento chopped coarse and eight 
eggs boiled twenty minutes. Let 'the eggis get perfectly 
cold. Then chop quite fine and salt plentifully. There 
should be twice as much o-f the egg as pimento. Put 
together and moisten with salad dressing made with 
very little sugar. Cut the bread thin, butter one side 
of it, and spread the mixture on the other half. This 
amount will m^ake abo<ut thirty sandwiches. If you do 
not use all the pimento, take what remains from the 
can, cover and set in a cool place. -When you wish an 
attractive salad for dinner, shave cabbage fine and place 
on a lettuce leaf. Then cut the pimento in small 
pieces and strew over the cabbage. The green, white 
and red make pretty combination. A delicious dress- 
ing for it is maide of tomato catsup, vinegar and oil 
seaeoneid to taste, or plain salad' dressing. 

Fruit Sandwiches. 

Delioate sandwiches of fruit, simply mashed or con- 
verted into a rich paste and placed between very thin 
slices of bread, are served with ice cream instead of 
cake. The nut sandwiches are especially liked for this 
purpose. 

Dates, figs o^r large rasins make excellent fillings for 
sweet sandwiches. Take out the seeds from the dates 
or rasins, chop them fine, and spread on thin slices of 
"bread that have first been spread with a little butter. 
Unless figs are very fresh it is best to steam them be-

tea or lemonade. 

Salad Dressing. 

Put in the dish you are to co'ok in, one heapino; 
tablespoonful of butter, same of white sugar, two level 
tahlespoionfuls dry mustard, about half teaspoon salt. 
Smooth these to a paste, add one unbeaten egg. Beat 
all up well, then another egg, beat more, then another, 
three in all. Beat until all is smooth, then add sma^U 
cup of vinegar, beat again, and, kisitly, one full cup 
of rich milk. O'f course if yOu have cream it is nicer. 
Put in double boiler and cook until it thickens like 
soft custard, usually about fifteen minutes. 'Stir it 
every few minutes. Now when it is cooking you can 
add more sugar if you like it sweeter, or more salt, and 
another time more or less mustard, according to youi- 
taste. It makes a delicate pale yellow idtressinig, which 
both appeals to the taste and the eye. 

Macedoine Salad. 

Make a mayonnaise dressing by beating a few times 
the yolk of an egg; then d^rop in salad oil, being care- 
ful to add only one drop at a time, and mixing steadily 
until the oil begins to thicken; then the oil may be 
added a few drops at a time. One cup O'f best olive 
oil, with the yolk of one egg, will make enough dress- 
ing for ;a ;SJm'all family. 'Before you aj"e ready to mix 
your dressing place the bottle of oil, an egg, a fork 
and a small bowl in the refriorerator, so that all will

of celery, half a dozen cherries and half a dozen straw-

Mahing Sandwiches.

are removed with a sharp knife, and that butter just

Mlacaroni, 5\lce, £tc. 

Macaroni out of ignorance as to its value as a food 
is only occasionally u&ed by Americans when it really 
should appear upon the tahle three or four times a 
week and growing children encouraged to eat it in- 
stead of so much meat. It is much cheaper and the 
full value units of beekstoak bring 949 while in one 
pound of macaroni there are 1,665 full value units. It 
is extremely nourishing and very economical. 

Baked Macaroni. 

Put a layer of macaroni that has been slowly bodied 
in salt water until tender in a buttered pan and sprinkle 
with one-third teacup of grated cheese, repeat until 
pan is full and pour over this until pan is about full 
rich milk in which has been added a small lump of 
butter and a sprinkle of salt and pepper; cover top 
with buttered bread crumhs and bake until brown. 

Lucai/n Eggs.

Macaroni. 

Boil one-fourth packaige of macaroni broken up in two 
and one-half inch pieces in a little salt water until

whole and bake light brown : One egg, one-half cup 
cream, one tablespoon floulr, one 'tiablespoon. butter, 
salt and pepper to taste, add about one-half cup of sweet 
milk. 

Rice. 

Always wash your rice in several waters and let it 
stand in warm water for one-half hour and then rinse 
off in cold water again before cooking. This swells 
the grains and takes out some of the starchy substance 
that makes it gummy and causes each grain to stand 
out which is very necessary for a pretty as well as whole- 
some dish of rice. 



Macaroni, Eke, Etc. 149 

Eice in Milk.

Of all substances found in the animal organism 
albumen is the one most directly eoncernedi with the 
phenomena of growth and development. Its value as 
a food is beyond compare and not at all sufficiently ap- 
preciated. The white of the raw egg is the most avail- 
able -form in which we can find albumen and should be 
used whenever possiible in the preparation of most 
foods for children. Albumen is one of the most easily 
digested substances and is rapidly taken up by the 
muscle cells. It is also a valuable food for adults. 

Frying Eggs. 

When frying eggs cover the skillet or they will be 
tough. This also saves burning as when covered they 
cook white all over the top and look nicer. 

Eggs ^Yitll Cheese. 

Six eggs, one-half cupful of rich milk, three table- 
spoonfuls fine chopped cheese, one and one-half table-

this way. If served this way cook meat first, keep 
warm on platter then put an egg on each slice of meat 
and dress with curled lettuce. 

Dressed Eggs. 

Cut hard boiled eggs in halves lengthwise and re- 
move yolks, masih and season with vinegar, mustard, 
salt anid pepper. Press in shape and fill cavities in 
whites. Serve in a bed of curled lettuce. 

Egg Cocktails. 

These are delicious appetite sharpeners. For each 
person a teaspoonful lemon juice, two drops tabasco 
sauce, one-half teaspoon grated horseradish, on teaspoon- 
ful tomato catsup, a little salt. Mix together; add 
one eg(g beaten to a foam. 

To Prepare Eggs For Delicate People. 

Put eggis in boiling water which you have just re- 
moved from fire or set on back of stove where just warm ; 
cover tightly and wrap pan with a heavy cloth, let 
btand ten or twelve minute®. The eggs will be of a 
custard like consistency. Serve on warm but not too 
hot plate. 

Buttered or Rumbled Eggs. 

Break three eggs into a small stewpan; add a table- 
spoonful of milk and an ounce of fresh butter, a salt- 
spoonful of salt and a little pepper. Set the stewpan

over a moderate fire and stir the eggs with a spoon, 
being careful to keep eveTy particle in motion until 
it is set. Have ready a crisp piece of toast, pooir the 
eggs upon it and serve immediately. This mode of 
dressing eggs secures that the white and the yolk shall 
'be perfectly mixed. 

Poached Eggs on Toast. 

Select .a shallow pan, fill neairly full of boiling water, 
add to each pint of water one teaspoonful each of ©alt 
and vinegar a.nd place where the water will simmer gent^ 
ly. Break an Q^g sepairately into a cup and slip gently 
from the cup into the water. Continue putting in eggs 
until you have the required number or there are enooigh 
in the pan. Dip the water over them with a spoon, and 
when the white is set and firm and a film has formed 
over the yolk, remove each carefully with a perforated 
cake turner. Carefully slide each egg on a piece of 
buttered toast, season with salt and pepper and serve 
at once. The vinegar or lemon juice is added to the 
water to aid in giving firmness to the o^gg. Poached 
egg^ are difficult to handle when not cooked too hard, 
and to be good there must be no delay betweem the 
cooking and the serving. 

Cwried Eggs. 

These are delicious appetizers for a light supper. 
Bodl the eggs hard', chill them in cold water, a.nd cut, 
in lengthwise halves. Take out the yolks and mix with 
a little cream, salt, pepper and curry powder to taste.

blending all together in a soft paste. Stuff the whites 
with this, sprinkle tops with a thick coating of finely 
powdered toast crumbs, top each egg with a nut of but- 
ter, and bak€ for ten minutes. 

Tomatoes and Eggs. 

This makes a delicioug luncheon dish. Cook six 
eggs until they are very hard boiled. Peel them and 
keep warm as possible. Make a sauce as follows: A 
tablespoon of butter, and a tablespoon of flour, mixed 
with one cup of tomatoes. Add to this one green 
pepper minced very fine, one tablespoon parsley ehop- 
j>ed very fine and salt to taste. Have ready six 
slices of toast. Wheat bread is delicious for this 
toast if you 'have it — if not the white will answer. 
Toast the bread a golden brown, and butter. On each 
piece of toast put one hard boiled egg, and pour the 
sauce over it. 

Soft Eggs. 

To boil eggs so that the whites will not be hard- 
ened into a lathery, indigestible consistency, pour boil- 
ing water on them, and set the dish on the back of 
the stove for about ten minutes. You probably won't 
hit it Just right every time if you prefer them soft 
boiled — they are really not boiled at all — but when you 
do they are vastly ' more palatable and easily digested 
than when cooked bv the three-minute rule.

To Tell Good Eggs. 

To tell good eggs put them in water — if the large 
ends turn up they are not fresh. This is an infallible 
rule to distinguish a good Q^g from a bad one. 

Poached Eggs. 

Break into pan of boiling salt wter 'one egg at a 
time and lift out with a perforated dipper. Serve in 
hot dish with butter poured over^ dash 'of salt and pep- 
per. 

Scrambled Eggs. 

Break eggs in dish, salt and pepper, tablespoon but- 
ter, one of lard in skillet, pour in eggs, stir briskly 
until creamy. 'Serve immediately. 

Hard Boiled Eggs. 

Peel hard boiled eggs and sprinkle with salt and 
pepper. M'ake a cream sauce and drop eggs in hot 
and whole. Serve in individual plates with lemou 
crescents. A nice breakfast dish it to chop up 
eggs in smiall pieces, moisten with a rich white sauce 
and spread on buttered toast. 

In making, any dish where only whites of eggs ai'c 
used, d'rop the yolks as you break them into a pan of 
bailing salt water, set on back of sto've until cooked 
hard. They are nice to slice in soups or cut up over 
slaws or salads or if Wianted for future use drop them 
in a vessel of cold water and put in a cool place or in 
refrigerator and they will keep fresh for a week or more 
by changing the water occasionally. 



43le5, jpu66lR35, 

Use in winter in making pas>try, roll on a cold 
Iward and handle as little as possible. 'Wlien crust is 
made it would improve it to let stand in refrigerator 
for three-quarter hour 'or in cold place in winter. A 
great improvement is to put ab€ut a teaspoonful of 
baking powder to each quart of flour and allso bru^h the 
paste over every time it is rolled out with the white 
of egg and adding little bits of butter. This causes 
it to rise in flakes. If you can hold your hand in oven 
while you can count twenty, it is about the right tem- 
perature and should be kept at this temperature as long 
as pastrv^ is in stove. This will bake it a light brown 
and keep it flaky looking. I/f you allow the heat to 
abate the inner crust will be clam.my. 

Pie crust will keep fresh for a week and the last 
be better than the first if you put in a closely covered 
dish and set in the chest in sumaner or cool place iu 
winter and you ican have your fresh pie often without 
much trouble. 

It is well in most pies to bake the under crust first 
and! have fillings as cool as posisible else the hottom. crust 
will be soggy. 

Fine Puff Paste. 

Into one quart of sifted flour mix two teaspoonfuls

of baking powder andi one teaspoon of salt, one tea- • 
cup each of butter and lard very cold, rub lard into 
flour until smooth then put in just eno'ugh ice water, 
say one-half cupful containing the beaten white of an 
egg to mix a diy Halve dough. Eoll out into a thin 
sheet, spread with one-quarter of the butter, sprinkled 
over with little flour, then roll up like a scroll, double 
the endis towards the center, flatten and roll, then spread 
again with another one-quarter of butter. Repeat this 
until butter is used! up. Put in earthen dish, cover 
with cloth, put in coiol place or in ice box. Let it re- 
miain an hour or more before making out crust. Pies 
made with this paste go into flakes almost at touch. 
This recipe was purchased at a fabulous price from 
a noted caterer and is without exception the finest 
ever used. 

Plain pie Crust. 

Two and >one-half cups of sifted flour, one cup but-

lialf teacup of cold water or enough to form a dry, 
flaky dough ; mix as little as possible and handle lightly 
just enough to make ingredients stick together. This 
will miake two pies. To give paste a flaky appearance

Sauces Tor jpuddings. 

MapUine. 

For all flavoring purposes thieire is nothing better 
nor more economical than "Crescent Mapleine.'' Every 
course fro^m soups to frozen desserts may much im- 
proved by using a few drops of Mapleine, thereby ad- 
ding a decidedly toothsome flavor to an otherwise or- 
dinary menu, giv;ing that delicate and de'licdous' maple 
flavor that is really much superior to the real maple. 
It is made from roots and herbs a.nd is both pure and 
wholesome, and I think surpasses by far any other 
flavoring now in use. 

Butter Sauce. 

One teacup butter, one teacup sug;ar, one teaspoonf u I 
of flour. Mix al)l well together and pour enough water 
till right ; constantly work until about M'ke isyrup ; flavor 
to taste. 

Sugar Sauce.

spoon flour, two tablespoous butter; stir all together 
and pour in boiling water until right consistency. Cook

A pint of berries mashed and beaten in, make a deliciour.

Caramel Sauce. 

Put one cup of sugar in a smiall pan and stir on 
the fire until brown. Add a cupful of boiling water 
and simmier fifteen minutes. 'Siet away to cool. 

Molasses Sauce. 

One cup of molasises, half a cup of water, a table- 
spoon of butter, a little cinnamon or nutmeg, one-fourth 
teaspoonful of salt, the juice of a lemon or a little 
vinegar. Boil together for twenty minutes. Nice for 
apple or rice pudding. 

Vanilla Sauce. 

Take one pint and a half of milk, stir in three 
beaten eggis, and pass through a strainer in a double 
bailer. Add three tabtespoontfuls of isugar. Put on 
the fire and when the wiater in the lower pan begins 
to boil, stir and keiep stirring until fJhe mixture has 
reached the consistency O'f a thick cream. Eemove from 
the fire, add a tablespoonful of vanilla, and serve warn' 
or cold. 



Have al'l the ingr^dJients readly before comnDen'cing 
to mix cake. I^ggs beat up much lighter if iput in ice 
box sometime before using and la very small pinch of 
sod'a often helps. Baking powder or cream of tartar 
s'li'ould be sifted together several times before 
using. iCare shou'ld' be taken that no air enters 
the oven andi a little jar often causes a cake 
to fall. The oven should be just right, not too 
hot nor too cold, much of the 'success 'dependis on this. 
The stove door should not be opened for some time after 
cake has been put to rise. The oven can be tested by 
thirowing in a little flour on bottom of oven; if it 
browns gradually it iis about right, but if it burns it 
is too hot and if it rem'ains white it is too cold. To 
ascertain when cake is done run a broomstraw through 
the middle; if it comes out smooth at will do to come 
out. 

Never stir a cake after butter and sugar are creamed 
but beat it down from the bottom, up land over. This 
japs the air into the batter and produces tlie little air 
cells which cause the dough to rise and swell when it 
comes in conistct with the heat while cooking. Always 
use a wooiden sp'oon. For folding in whites a broad 
bladedl pallett knife is best. N^ever heat at all after 
whites are folded in and get in oven as soon as possible 

169 



170 The Model HottseJceeper. 

Always make cake a little higher on edJge, as the middle 
usually rises higher anyway. Always dust pan over with 
flour after igreasing. If possible have a heavy glass cup 
and reserve a little batter of cake and igrease cup and put 
in batter and put in oven with cake and an occasional 
peep in oven through this cup will show what is hap- 
pening to batter in big mold. This will be worth 
much to all cake biakers. When the e'dges begin to 
shrink away fromi pan the cake is almost doine. One 
thing to rememiber distinctly is never to jar a cake 
while it is in the batter form and if 3^ou are compelled 
to open the door do so very gently. Eemember a cupful 
of flour measures three or four tablespoonfuls more from 
the barrel than it does when sifted. If that amount were 
a'dided to the most icare'fully prepared recipe the result 
would be a heavy tough cake. Always use two cups, 
one for wet and one for dry mieasure. Always have your 
whites well chilled before beating them. Use a wire 
whisk egg beater; a (pinch of sa'lt added to the Whites 
will make them whip easily. 

Corn Starch in Sponge Cake. 

A friend said to me a few days since, "I used to 
have trouble with my sponge cake falling after it had 
risen nicely, now I no longer have that trouble, I 
simply stir in a tablespoonful of cotu starch to the 
flour and when the cake comes up it stays up and is as 
light aitd feaithery as one could wish.'^ I have never 
tried thi8 myself .

preserving kettle and let it come to a hoil; pour over 
the fruit. Do this for nine successive mjomings and 
you will have something delicious. 

Creamed Apples. 

Pare your fruit and either scald or bake it until 
sufficiently soft to pulp it througih a colander; sweeten 
to taste, fill yo'ur glasses three parts full with it, then 
plentifully sprinkle in some powdered cinnamon, put 
a good layer of rich whipped cream on the top and sift 
white sugar over it. 

Fruit for Dessert. 

Beat well the white of an egg witli a little water; 
dip the fruit in, and roll it immediately in some fine 
crushed sugar; place it on a dish and leave it five or 
?ix hours, then serve. A more sightly and exquisite des- 
sert than a plate of currants thus dTessed, cannot be 
had. The use of '^'haked bananas" in the place of apple- 
sauce is both new and delicious. Few use the bananas

cooked. They are more easily digested than the raw 
bananas and much m^ore palatahle. 

To Bahe Bananas. 

Eemove skins and- scrape long fibers from the out- 
side; cut in halves, lengthwise, and iput in a gi'anite 
pan. Pour over the bananas a mixture of two table- 
spoons of melted butter, one-third cup of sugar and the 
juice from half a lemon. Bake in a modem oven 
about thirty minutes. Turn once diuring baking. 
The bananas should be basted frequently with the 
sugar^and-butter mixture, which forms a thick syrup 
and bro'wns slightly where the bananas are done. 

Iced Fruits. 

Take fine bunches of ripe currants on the stalk, dip 
them in gumarabic water, or the whites of eggs well 
beaten; lay them on a sieve, sift white sugar over and 
let them diry. They are very nice for dessert or the tea 
table. Bunches of grapes, cherries or plums may be 
done in the same way. 

Peach Marmalade. 

Pare and cut up the peaches in small pieces, and to a 
pound of fruit add a pound of sugar. WTien the sugar 
is dissoilved set it over the fire, and let it boil till it is a 
smooth paste. Stir it all the time it is boiling. Put it 
in the jars while warm and paste them over the next 
day.

pie.") Line a puddling dish with pastry and fill it with 
ripe, luscious Madkberries. Sprinkle liberally with sugar 
and cover with a top crust which has been rolled thin, 
dioubled together and gashed with a knife. Open it and 
spread over the berries and press the edges down with a 
fork. Bake slowly for half an hour. Serve with cream 
or with butter and sugar. In the winter use canned 
berries.

into an earthen m'old, and turn the liquid jelly over 
them. Set in a cold place to harden. Serve with 
whipped cream. 

Gooseberry Jam. 

To six pounds of ripe gooseberries allow four pounds 
of granulated sugar. Top and tail the berries and boil, 
stirrinof often, for an hour. If there seems to be too

ries have boiled for an hour add sugar and cook for 
an hour longer. Put the boiling hot jam into glasses 
and seal. 

Preserved Peaches.

over. The round yellow variety of tomato should be 
used and as soon as ripe. 

Pears. 

Pare, cut in halves and throw into cold water. Take 
one pound of sugar and a little over a cup of water for 
every three pounds of the fi'uit. When the syrup boils 
put in a layer of fruit and cook until tender. Have jars 
ready in a p^an of boiling hot water (be careful to 
plunge them in so the water strikes outside and inside 
at the same time) ; fill the jars to the tojp with fruit, 
then pour on boiling syrup to the brim and screw the 
tops very tight. Set away in a cool, dark place. 

Brandied Peaohes. 

Put the peaches in boiling water for a few minutes, 
Avhen the skin will peel off easily. Make a syrup of half 
a pound of sugar and half a teacaip of water for each 
pound of peaches. Skim as the scum rises in boiling, 
then put in the peaches and boil them gently until ten- 
der — no lonjger. Take them^ out carefully and fi'U your

mens of Siweet-smelling violets and when syrup is ready 
dip flowers into it singly until all are thoroughly coated 
allowing each coat to dry before dipping in the violet 
la second time. The syrup should not be too hot else 
flowers will wither. Set flowers on a sifter to dry, 
and when by being repeatedly dipped and they are 
sufficiently coated roll each flower in confectioners' 
sugar before the last coating has a chance to become 
dry. Set aside and when thoroughly dry they are 
ready for use and will keep a long time.

done set the saucepan of syrup into an outer vessel of 
boiling water, add a tablespoon of lemon juice and 
dip the apples in quickly, turning them over until 
thoroughly coated with the syrup. Lay on waxed 
paper to dry. To prepare the apples simply wipe each 
clean with a damp cloth and run a fine skewer through 
it. Choose small, firm apples for this purpose. 

Candied Figs. 

Wash the figs and plunge them into hot water. 
Set them over the fire and boil for a few minutes. Take 
them out with a fork and drain in colander, laying a 
plate over them and upon the plate a flatiron or other 
heavy weight to siqueeze out ail the moisture. While 
they are draining, m-ake a rich syrup of a quart of 
granulated sugar and a pint of water. Use sugar and 
water in these proportions, grading the quantity by 
the number of figs you wish to put up. This is en- 
ough for forty or fifty fi^gs. When every drop of 
water has been dnained from the figs, put them into 
the boiling syrup and cook steadily until the syrup 
has almiost boiled away. Add then a heaping cupful 
of sugar. Coiok the figs in this long enough to make 
sure it is dissolved; drain again; spread the figs upon 
broad graniteware platters or pians and diry in the sun- 
shine. Turn them many times while they are drying. 

Use an aluminimi kettle in this work, and toward

the close of the boiling diown put a piece of tin or of 
asbestos under the kettle to prevent scorching. -We 
think things which require protracted boiling are less 
likely to burn in an aloiminum kettle than in other ware. 

Fig Candy, 

One cupful of sugar, one-'lialf cupful of water, one- 
fourth teaspoonful cream of tartar. Do not stir while

fMy sister, refrain from spending the little change 
yoTi have been saving for fun-spending such as niiat- 
inees, sodia, treats, etc., and insted hie your to the near- 
est kitchen shop and! supply yourself with household 
tools, so dear to the house wife's heart and I can safely 
say in the end for the amiount expended you'll get 
more genuine satisfaction than you would in many 
times the ^amount spent foolishly. 

Aluminum 

I'S the proper thing for kitchen utensils and to eorres- 
pond with these if one does not feel ahle tO' replace the 
ii'on sink for a iporcelain one, it should be treated to 
several coats of aluminum paint which will never tar- 
nish. The sink must be perfectly clean and free from 
rus't and) grease and thoroughly dry before painting, 
also treat the water pipes in same way. It certainly 
will transform their apipearance. Unscrew the water 
pipes from the back groimd of wood and slip a sheet 
of zinc behind them large enough to cover the wood- 
work. This will be held in place by the pipes when 
screwed back but the sink should also have a few un- 
conspicuous tacks around the edge over the wood sur- 
rounding the sink and also over the wooclten extension 
at end of sink should be covered with the zinc. This 
covered woodien extension inclines downwand toward 

230 



IIonseTceeper' es Kitchen Conveniences. 231 

sink. The wire dish .drainer may be placed upon this. 
Then the hot running water poured over dishes as they 
may dry easily and water run quickly into sink and 
leave no trace of prolonged dampness as it does on the 
grooved wooden shelf. The combination oi the gray 
zinc andl silVertOined aluminum' is exceedingly pleas- 
ing. The whole kitchen ig madte moTe cheery by this 
shining sink andi dish-washing is not so irksome as when 
one is obliged' to contemplate black iron and dingy 
wood-work. 

Stopped Up Sink. 

Sink stoppage is usually caused by grease, some- 
times by coffee grounds, and in ninety-nine cases out 
of a hundiredi by carelessness. iSee that your plates 
are scraped free from grease and scraps before they 
go into the dlishpan. Insist that coffee grounds shall 
find their way into the garbage can rather than the 
sink. Keep a small, stiff scrubbing brusih, an iron 
sinksicraper (with a rubber edige) near at hand, and 
enforce their use after dishwashing time. 

If these few simple rules are obeyed, if none of the 
greasy Avater in which vegetables (have been cooked, 
gravies, or other greasy liquids are poured into the 
sink (and it is not the pliace for them), if the pipes are 
scalded daily, with clean water and plenty of common 
waishing aoda, you run very little risk of stoppage. 

A plumber once said to me: "If women would use 
more soda in their sink pipes, there* would be less

work for us.. 'Some of them use lye, which cuts the 
grea&e, but ruins the pipes. Sodla is far Ibetter." 

The Kitchen Beautiful. 

Although it sometimes proves dlangerous to trifle 
with the cook, especially if she be of the New York 
variet}^, yo'^ng housekeepeTs like a word' or two in the 
arrangement of the kitchen, says a writer in the New 
York Press. One interior decorator has just fitted up 
a kitchen in a country cottage with a color scheme of 
blue and! copper. The paint is blue and. the cooking 
utensils 'are of copper. The chairs are fitted with 
square blue cushions, and when the cooking is over for 
the day ihe table is laid with an art linen cloth of 
the same shaide. There are even blue candles in copper 
hol'ders, and the dresser shelves are laid with blue 
floral paper. 

"Alumintum kitchen ware looks moist attractive,"' 
says this same decorator, '^^against rough wall paper of 
old rose. I have just furnished a flat kitchen in that 
style. The floor is laid with polished linoleum in a 
shade of rose, and casement curtains m the window 
repeat the samie color scheme." Erven the humhle duster 
of the kitchen beautiful is taking on new airs. It is 
now of crash, patterned with bright borders to match 
the color of the kitchen or butler's pantry. 

''Wear Ever" Aluminum. 

In speaking of aluminum I feel it my diuty for the 
benefit of my patrons to recommend the ^'^Wear Ever** 



Housekeeper's Kitchen Conveniences. 233 

braiTud. I have never used any other and believe it has 
a right to lay claim to the name chosen "'Wear Ever." 
It, I am sure, has many more novel styles of utensils 
and is much more durable as well as brighter and more 
ajttractive in ever)^ way than other brands and I wooild 
suggest by all means when investing in aluminum, 
whenever possible, to get tho '^'Wear Ever" brand. 

Gasoline. 

Ajfter .cleaning an article that requires to be cleaned 
in gasoline, the gasoline that is left over can be used 
again, no miatter how black and dirty it may look, by 
pouring it in Mason glass jar or bottle and let stand 
a few hours all the dirt will settle to the bottom and 
gasioline be perfectly clear. 

Dishcloths. 

The best dlish cloths are made of knitted cotton. 
They will wash again and again and still look like new. 

Ammonia. 

Always have a bottle of household ammonia in 
kitchen and soak towels in suds with a tablespoonful 
O'f ammonia adlded while putting away dishes, then 
wring out and rinse and hang in sunshine to dry. 

Coal Oil as Cleanser. 

Coal oil will clean a porcelain or zinc sink immediate- 
ly and if an iron one is saturated with it and left over 
night will free it entirely from rust and grease and leave 



234 The Model Housekeeper. 

it nice and clean. Always keep a stack of newspapers 
in kitchen; make dishwashing much easier to wipe out 
greasy dishes with them before putting in Wiater, and 
papers are useful in so many ways in kitchen. 

New Ironware 

Should! nott be used for codking until it is first boiled 
in water with potato peelings added. This is best 
means of getting them in proper shape. Someone 
c-ouldi db a bride a great favor by letting her know 
about this. 

Remove Jar Tops. 

Dip a woolen cloth in very hot water and wrap 
around the outside of cap. This will cause it to ex- 
pand. 

Kitchen Carpet. 

A carpet bacllly fadied and scarcely fit for use may 
be utalized in following manner : "Clean thoroughly 
from dust^ tack on floor wrong side up and paint it. 
The first coat should be quite thick and it is better 
to use the yellow ochre for first coating. After this 
coat is real dry apply the next two which can be any 
shade desired. However, let each coat dry before put- 
ting on another. A carpet treated in this way will out 
wear linoleum. 

Spool for Pegs. 

Drive a nail through an empty spool .and you will 



Housekeeper's Kitchen Conveniences. 235 

have a .good peg on w'hich to ihanig in the kitchen and 
f antrv, kitchen porches and cellar. The spool will not 
tear nor rust as a nail does. 

Bags for Biscuit Bourd and Boll Bins. 

M'ake of heavy unbleached muslin to open at one 
end with draw strings to hang up. Will keep them 
from flies, dust and dirt. 

Lamp Wick 

Will bum evenly if you cut a V in center after it is 
trimmied for use. 

Watering House Blants. 

Use a whi^k broom when sprinkling plants in house. 

A slate with pencil attached and hung in kitchen 

is convenient to put down things as you think of them. 

Clean Lamp CJiimneys. 

A few drops of 'alcohol rubbed on inside of lamp 
chimneys will remove all traces of greasy smioke when 
water is of no avail, and to make them less fragile (also 
glassware of any kind), place them in pan of cold salt 
"\\'ater and let them heat very igradually until they reach 
the boiling point then continue boiling a few iminutes; 
set off fire and leave articles in water until quite cold. 
Dishes that have become brown and burned from bak- 
ing can be easily cleaned after standing a while in 
borax w^ater. 



236 TJie Model Housekeeper. 

Glassware — Cut Glass. 

A little bluing in which glassware is washed ad'^is 
much to its brilliancy. 

Kitchen Table. 

Always put your kitchen table in front of window. 
It is much more cheerful than a bare wall. Tie a dust 
bag over your broom and rub oveT yo'ur porch every 
morning and it will require a great 'deal less m^opping 
with water. 

Bags Over Pitchers. 

Paper bags are fine for islipping over pitchers con- 
taining food. 

Marie the Brushes and Brooms. 

If you have a pyrography outfit, it is best to have 
every broo'm and scrubbing brush marked with the 
name and object for which it is designed, so that there 
will be ido danger of yooir Persian rug bemg swept 
with a greasy kitchen broom'. 

Kerosene as a Cleansing Medium. 

FoT cleaning cut glass, mirrors, windows, etc., kero- 
sene is a fine medium. A little rag dipped in the oil 
and this rubbed over the surface of window, then wiped 
off with clean cloth and polished! with tissue paper 
or chamois, gives a luster not exceilled by .any cleaning 
preparation. It leaves no odor on glassware and it

d'oes leave a woniderful brilliance. It will clean the 
dirtiest paint spots in a anom<ent; galvanized ironware 
which is so difficult is readily cleaned with the coal oil. 

TJie Household Indicator. 

One of the handy things in the kitchen is tlie house- 
hold indicator. This is a sort of a tally hoard on 
which are listed all the articles us'ed in the kitchen 
from bacon up to matches and flour. There are small 
pegs fitted to the smiall holes opposite each item on the 
list and all one has to do when out of a needed article is 
to place a peg and then when the butcher or grocer 
b'cy calls there is no excuse for forgotten supplies. Try 
this by all m'eans. 

Tinware. 

If new tinware be rubbed over with fresh lard and 
thoroughly heated in the oven before it is used, it will 
never rust afterwards, no matter how^ much it is put 
in water. For stained tinware borax produces the best, 
results. If a teapot or coffee pot is discolored on ti:e 
inside, boil it in a strong solution of borax for a short 
time, and all its brightnesis will return. 

While you are cooking have a dishpan of soapy 
water where it will keep warm, and in it wash every 
cup, pan or spoon as soon as it has been used. After 
the meal is over the kitchen dishwashing will be a 
?mall task. 

Zinc. 

That zinc may be brightened by an application of 



338 The Model Housekeeper. 

lime and water, mixed to the consistency of cream. 

Poison for Flies. 

A good poison for fiies may be made by 'boiling 
quBjSsia chips in water into a very strong decoction, and 
then sweetening the liquid with treacle or sugar. This 
fly poison may be used with safety, as it is not injurious 
to human beings. 

The Government Whitewash. 

The way this recipe came to be called "govern- 
ment recipe'^ is explained as follows : Some time 
ago an autograph letter under date of Decem^- 
ber, 1871, from U. S. 'Grant, then President of 
the United States, was published, giving the formula 
of this whitew^ash to a friend of his in California, and 
added that he had whitewashed the White House all 
over with it. We quote from this letter : ^ 

"Half a bushel of unslacked lime, slake with warm 
water, cover it during the process to keep' in the steam ; 
strain the liquid through a fine sieve or strainer; add 
a peck of salt previously w^ell dissolved in warm water, 
three pounds of ground rice boiled to a thin paste and 
stir in boiling hot, half pound of powdered Spanish 
whiting and a pound of glue w%ich has been previously 
dissolved over a slow fire, and add five gallons hot 
water to the m^ixture, stir well and let it stand for a few 
dlays, covered up from the dirt. It should be put on 
hot. One pint of the mixture will covar- a square

yard, properly applied. Small brushes are best. There 
is nothing than can compare with it for outside or in- 
side work, and it retains its brilliancy for many years. 
iColoring matter may be put in and made of any shade, 
Spanish brown, yellow oohre or common clay." 

Tin Cans. 

Do not throw away tin cans that have closely-fitting 
covers. They may ^be painted and used for rice, meal, 
hominy and all d*y groceries, and make your pantry 
shelves very attractive. Remove the labels, wash the 
tins in strong soap suds and dry them thoroughly. For 
twenty-five cents you can procure of any painter a pot 
of dark gray paint ready for use. Apply it with a 
broad, soft brush, so it is even and smooth. When it 
becomes dry, then, with a small earners hair brush and 
a little bright red paint, mark the name of what the 
box is to contain. The name is readily seen, and these 
boxes will save time as well as please 'the eye. 

Stove. 

Rub your stove off daily with newispapers; it will 
keep it in fine polish and' it will not be so hard on 
one's hands. 

Rust. 

To remove rust from iron utensils. — ^Rust may be 
removed by first rubbing oil well into the article, and 
in forty-eight hours cover it with finely powdered lime, 
rub it well, and the rust will disappear. Or, the pre- 



240 The Model Housekeeper. 

vention of iron from rust may be accomplislied thus : 
Adid to a quart of water half a pound of quick lime, 
let this stand until the surface is perfectly clear; pour 
off the clear liquid, and stir up with a quantity of olive 
oil, until it becomes a thickyi 'cream. Kub any articles 
which are to be put by with this mixture and then 
wrap up in paper. If the nature of the articles will not 
admit of their being wrapped up in paper, they will re- 
main free from' rust by covering them more thickly witli 
the mixture. 

Water Purified. 

Water can be purified in a cistern by dropping in a 
large piece of common charcoal. 

Tepid water is produced by combining two-thirds 
coM and o'ne-half boiling water. 

An Ashestos Mat Under the Bread-Pan. 

Will help the bread rise on a cold night. The ordinary 
asbestos stove-mat may be heated for this purpose, 
placed between newspapers to retain the heat, and then 
slipped npder the bread-pan. 

Fill Your Tea Kettle Through a Funnel 

Placed in the spout of the kettle and held under the 
cold-water faucet at the sink. By doing this you may 
avoid many a bad burn caused by the escaping steam 
when the lid of the kettle is removed. Have a little 
funnel over your sink, where it will be easy to use.

The Best Way to Keep Clothespins. 

Is to have a box 'made with a lid and attach it to the 
side of a cl'othespost. The clothespins are always ready 
for use and aire kept cleaner than in a basket. 

Mend the Wringer. 

When the rollers of the wringer begin to break, 
get five cents worth of bicycle tape and wind it around 
them. Do this carefully and snugly, and then wind a 
piece of white cotton cloth around the tape. They will 
last twice as long as if treated in the u&ual way. 

Cellar. 

Warm water put in the cellar on cold nights to 
prevent freezing, should be in closed vessels, which 
warms up the air, making it dryer without evaporating 
moisture into it. 

Sing. 

Sisters, when you have a big lot of dishes to wash 
or a big ironing to do, just sing some good song and 
let wour mind dwell on it, and your work will be do-ne 
before you know it. At least that is my experience.

Cleaning House. 

Some time before you propose starting your clean- 
ing you should go carefully over the house and note 
down exactly what has to be done in tlie way of cal- 
cimining and repapering. Next exaimiine all your chairs, 
especially those with stuffed seats, obseirving which re- 
quire repairs; also inspect the casters on all heavy 
furniture, such as piano, wardrobes, beds, etc., for if 
any should happen to be broken or twisted very serious 
diamage will be done to your carpets and oilcloth when 
3"0u have to move the furniture to and fro at clean- 
ing time. Then your tables and other flat topped fur- 
niture should receive attention. If scratched, dented, 
discolored with hot dishes or worm eaten make a note 
of the dJamages. When your list is completed begin at 
once to repair, scoring off as each is coimpleted. 

Cleaning Feather Beds. 

Should you wish to wash the ticks, don't empty 
the feathers in a barrel and let they fly about the room. 
Take a short sheet, double it and sew it up to within n 
few inches of one side; rip the tick the same length, 
sew the openings together, and empty the feathers into 
the sheet. Oarefully baste hoth openings, and when 

242 



Hame Furnishings. 243 

tlae tick is wasbed and d'ried, return the feathers in the 
.same manner. LF'eathers dan be nicely cldansed by 
washing as you would clothes, wringing dry and p'ut- 
ti;ig in sacks in the sun or by the fire where they will 
dry quick. 

Draperies. 

To clean draperies, I use sawdust and ammonia. 
Put the sawdust into a tub and pour in enough house- 
hold ammonia to soak it to the bottoan. Beat the 
draperies or rugs free of d'ust. Put them^ into the 
sawdust and, with a small whisk broom, rub the mix- 
ture well into the article to be cleaned. The dirt will 
disappear at once. Hang out of doors to dry and air. 

To clean lace, get a large paper bag and put the 
laces into it. Pour in a quart or more of Indian meal, 
and shake the bag up and down — ^not hard, but steadily 
—for some minutes. Do this several days, and fooir or 
five times 'a day. I cleaned a hand-madie bat in that 
way and it came out as white as snow. 

Caring for Oilcloth. 

The careful housewife avoids the use of either soap 
or ammonia in the water with which her oilcloth is 
cleaned. iShe knows that their use will injure the 
material and render the colors dull and lifeless. 'She 
also avoids a brush unless she owns a very soft one, and 
lelies upon clear, clean water and' soft flannel cloths 
for her cleandnsr work. 

When the oilcloth has been washed clean, she rubs 



244 The Model Hotisekeeper, 

it dry with a fresh dry flannel cloth and! then polishes 
the entire surface with a rag upon which there is a 
very little linseed oil,, or some skimmed milk. The 
milk dioes very satisfactory work, hnt should be aYoided 
in summer time, as it will briuig flies. 

Some housekeepers think that oilcloth keeps its 
freshness and gives far better service if treated to 
a coat of varnish when it is first put down. 

Oilcloth. 

An oilcloth miay be 'cleaned and made to last as 
long again if treated in the following manner: Cut 
into pieces half an ounce of beesewax, put in a saucer, 
cover entirely with turpentine, and place in the oven 
until melted. After washing the oilcloth thoroughly 
with a flaninel, rub the whole surface lightly with a bit 
of flannel dipped in the melted wax and turpentine. 
Then rub with a dry cloth. A polish is produced and 
the surface is lightly coated with the wax. ¥/hen tho 
floor Tequires to be cleaned the wax is washed off, to- 
gether with the dust or dirt that m-ay have gathered, 
while the oilcloth is preserved. 

Furniture Polish. 

An excellent furniture polish is madie of ten cents 
worth of beesewax, pla'ced into a tin cup and melted 
in a hot oven. Into this ,pour two ounces of turpen- 
tine, and let it stand to cool. Apply it brisfcly to the 
furniture with a woolen rag, and give it a finishing 



Home Furnishings. 245 

rub with an old silk handkercihieif. This polish is al- 
most equal to a coat of varnish. 

The Proper Sized Broom. 

A heavy hroom should be chosen for thoroTigh sweep'- 
ing in preference to a light one for the weight adds 
to the ^process. To test a new broom press the edge 
against the floor. If the straws bristle out and bend 
the bix)om is a poor one and sTiould be rejected. They 
should remain in a firm, soliKi ma;ss. 

Rug. 

If you want a nice rug that will wear well and yet 
not cost a fortune have one made oi a long wool sheep- 
skin. A great many of the rugs sold in the m'arket for 
bearskin are nothing in the world but long wool sheep- 
skin. Get some farmer who has sheep to cure the sikin 
for you, then color it yourself with the wool dyes that 
are sold ready prepared. 

W^en oiled! walnut furniture begins to grow dingy 
it can, be miade to look as fresh as new by reoiling. 
Linseed, or even olive oil, may be used, but pure, good 
keros'ene oil is ^much the best. Eub it well in with' a 
soft woolen rag, and polish with clean, dry flannel. 

Discolorations on Basin. 

The stains and discolorations. made in marble basins 
from the dripping of faucets can be removed with pul- 
verized chalk. Dip an old nail or tooth brush in water. 



246 The Model Housekeeper. 

then in the chjalk, and in an instants rubbing will do 
the work. 

Ink spots on marble may be removed with a paste 
m'aide by dissolving an ounce of oxalic acid and half an 
ounce of butter of antimony in a pint of rain water 
and adding sufficient flour to form a thin paste. Apply 
to the stains with a brush, allow it to remain three 
or four days and then wash it off. Make a ^second ap- 
plication, if necessary. 

Mirror. 

A mirrow sunk into a closet door is one of the 
most satisfactory clecor'ations on record, for what woman 
has not pined for a full-length mirror? It is also one 
of the most expensive ways of decorating, but then ex- 
pensive things are apt to be dear to the femanine heart. 

Sweeping Stair. 

Use a paint brush when sweeping the stairs instead 
of the ordinary dust brush. Use a soft brush of med- 
ium size. It will remove the dust from the corners 
and between the banisters very easily. 

Keeping Fire at Night. 

In banking thie fire at night it is a good idea to wet 
the sifted -ashes on top, but also to add to the water a 
liberal supply of common or even roek salt. The latter 
ingreddent not only keeps the under fire alive, but in 
raking off in the morning the salt makes it sparkle 
anew and give out as much heat as a new supply of 



Home Furnishings. 247 

coal. And, as I have learned that chestnut or even pea 
coal is the best size to oise, from cellar to roof, I am be^ 
ginning to salt-water all my coal before using it. A 
watering pot and a bag of salt are simple weapons 
with which any housekeeper can fight the coal barons. — 
Exch angle. 

Carpet. 

A carpet with small figures not only wears better 
than one with large, but makes a small room seem 
larger than it is. 

Hot Water For Brooms. 

Brooms dipped for a few minutes in boiling suds 
once a week will last much longer than they otherwise 
would, as this toughens the strandis. 

Mildew and Brass. 

To remove mildtew, make a very weak solution of 
chloride of lime' — a heapedl-up teaspoonful to one quart 
of water. Einse the cloth in clear water as soon as 
the spots are out. 

A bath of yellow ammionia, followed .by a sicrubbing 
with an ordinary kitchen brush, will make the most 
venerable relic look like new brass. Einse in clear 
waTm water andi wipe thoroughly dry. 

Ants, Bugs and Weevil. 

'Get rid of water bugs and ants, weevils and roaches 
by washing shelves and floors with borax. A lady who 



24:8 The Model Housekeeper. 

lived in an apartment hou&e remarked: '^1 live in 
an apartment where there are 26 famildes, and I have 
not had a bug of any kind for years." I also clean my 
carpets every Friday with borax, and never find a moth. 
I sprinkle borax in my packing boxes when I put away 
woolens andl feather pil'lows, using it liberally, andl the 
moths never touch them. Turpentine is godd for 
washing woodwork and floors in closets and wardrobes. 
Mioths will not live in 'a place that has been washed 
with turpentine. 

An Economy Tip. 

It is we'll to have your sheets and tablecloths folded 
widithways occasionally instead of lengthways, as this 
prevents the fold from always coming in the s«ime 
place and thus causing that place to wear out first. 

Butter. 

When butter is put into the ice chest or refrigera- 
tor cover it tight and it will not absorb o'dors from 
the other contents. 

Hats. 

To iron a silk hat hold the hat in the left hand 
and pass a warmi iron quickly arotund, following the 
lay of the nap. 

To Freshen the House. 

A few drops of oil of lavender in a silver or orna- 
mental dish of some kind one^half full of very hot 
water and set in the dining room just before dinner 



Home Furnishings. 249 

is served gives a delightful fresbneiss to the atmosphere 
of the apartment. It is also nice to have a small vessel 
in parlor or dressing rooims when arranging the house 
for a festivity. 

To Protect a Kice Comfort 

From the hands and coming in contact with the face, 
tear a strip of any kind of lightweight washahle white 
goods about one-third yard in width, as long as com- 
fort is wide; dotted Swiss ruffled is very pretty. 
Easte about three inches on wrong sidle and turn over 
and haste the other side with a ruffle. This looks clean 
and dainty and can be taken off and laundtried and 
yon can't imagine how it s^ves yonir nice comforts. 

Mattresses. 

Alwa^^s make a cover for your anattresses for pro- 
tection from dirt and d^st. It is very nice made of 
siome cheap cotton cloth and can be washed. A fad 
now is to make this covering of pretty bright flowered 
chintz. Should j'ou use this use same for pillows. 

Windows and Bureau Drawers, 

That move with difficulty rub their ^dges with hard 
soap. 

To Clean Straw Matting 

Never use soap a,nd water on matting but instead, 
tie bran in a cheese cloth bag. dp bag in warm water, 



250 The Model Housekeeper. 

ru'b the carpet briskly with it and rinse with a cloth 
wrunig out of warm salt water. 

Pretty Porch Pillows. 

Made of silkoline cretone or something similar with 
bright colored flowers sprinkled over a light back- 
ground. They should be made plain with no ruffles 
and covered with a pretty white slip made of 
.sheer curtain goods to go over the figured pillows. The 
effect is lovely. You may trim outside slip with ruf- 
fles or any desirable way. 

Hiding a Trunk. 

■When a trunk is unsightly in a girFs room' a good 
way to make a nice d^ressing table and dispose 
of trunk and have both occupy same space. Make a 
shelf as large as top of a dressing table, fastened 
to wall just high enough to admit trunk funderneath it 
with lid raised. Hang pretty curtains around shelf 
and a mirror over it, after spreading on top a pretty 
dresser scarf you will have a very attractive table and 
as well a hiddfen trunk. 

A Notebook for Suggestions 

kept in the ^hopping-bag will be found useful when 
friends tells you of a new shop, a new recipe or a 
new book. Having something at hand in which to 
write down the suggestion will save it from being lost 
entirely.

A Bag for the Children's Gloves 

M^ade over an emibroi'dery^hoop and kept haniging a4; a 
convenienit height in a haJl closet, will ®alve the prob- 
lem of many mothers who have to leave everything dse 
to help find tlie children's gloves before they start for 
school. Such a bag is always open, and the. children 
■will .soon get in, the habit of dropping their gl93^es and 
mittens into it. ^ , . . • 

' A Cover for a Hot Water Bottle 

of felt or cloth, with a flap fastened by a button and 
loop, will be a boon to any woman who drives in the 
country in winter. Fill the bottle with hot water be- 
fore 'starting out, and slip it into the cas'e ; then hold 
it on the knees under the rug, where the hands 'may 
be warmed alternately. 

Moths. 

If woolens and furs are wrapped closely in . thick 
brown paper and all the folds of the paper pasted to- 
gether the moth can find no entrance. G-arments 
should be sunned 'and beaten before they are put away. 
Insect powder, tobacco, camphor, cayenne pepper, are 
used to keep moths away. Half a dozen common tallow 
candles wrapped up on inside carpets will keep moths 
away, as they do not like the smell of tallow. 

TrunTcs. 

\^^atever you economize in don't let it be the price 



252 The Model Housekeeper, 

of your trunk. One journey will be thie wrecking of 
a cheap trunk, andl two will cause its utter undoing. 
This is one of the cases where the best is, in the end 
the least extravagant. 

Gas Mantles. 

Before using new gas mantles, soak them in vinegar 
and hang them up to dry. When quite dry put them 
on the burners. In this a way a brilliant white light is 
obtained, and the burners will last twice as long as 
usual, even in draughty places. 

Irik From Woadworh. 

Turpentine will remiove ink from' white wood-work. 
To soften the hard, dry putty in the windows, wet 
it with muriatic acid. 

Ice on Windows. 
Alcohol will keep ice from forming on windows. 



Coloring Artificial Flowers. 

For coloring oM flowers oil paint and gasoline 
works to a oharm to color any siliaide d'esired. For a 
delicate pink use a very little red paint. Stir paint 
into a dish of gasoline until riglxt shade. Dip in 
flowers quickly, shake and put on paper to dry. To 
color a straw hat use more paint and less gasoline and 
put on with hrushes. Old flowers' of good material 
can be treaitcd this way season after season. Don't 
waste time with water colors. Laces can also ibe colored 
in sam« way. 

To Keep Silver Bright in China Closet. 

I fln<! a'fter cleaning silver well, it will stay clean 
for months by putting on each shelf a lump of cham- 
phor. 

Oiling Sewing Machine. 

Before beginning your spring sewing oil your ma- 
chine thoroughly with gasoline. Let stand over night 
and you will have a clean machine. Then oil well 
with good machine oil bo fore attempting to run the 
machine. 

Alum in Rinse Water 

Will restore almost any fadfe'd colors if put in rinsing 
water after goodls are washed.

To Extinguish ■ Fire in Chimney.. 

Throw on handsful of salt or flour of sulphur or 
keep all doors and windows closed tightly ' and hold 
a wet blanket before fire opening to excliide air. 'In 
ascaping from a fire crawl with your face as near the 
floor as possible. Children should alwa}-* be taught 
young how to put out sparks when they' Lhappen "to

To Clean Kid Gloves. 

Put on gloves and wash in gasodine as if you were 
washing your hands in water. Clean them like new. 
Be careful not to clean in house where there is fire. 

Yolks of Egg. 

Left-over yolks of eggs will keep 'fresh for several 
days if dropped into a glass of cold water and put in 
cool place. Another good way if you are using a good 
many whites is to as you break them drop the yolks 
in boiling salt water without breaking them and use 
in salad or for any kind of dressings. 

To Wash Brushes. 

Never us^e hot water as it softens the bristles. Wash 
with a strong solution of soda and rinse in cold water 
and dry in shade. Never wet the back of brush. 

Kcrep Lamp Chimneys From Smoking. 

Soak well in vinegar and dry before using.

Moth. 

Closets that have beoomJe infestdd with moth should 
be well rubbed with a strong tobacco tea and repeatedly 
sprinkled! with spirits of champhor. 

To Break Glass 

Any size wianted file a notch on edl^e with file size 
wanted, then heat a small rod of iron red hot. Apply 
the hot iron to the notch and surface of the glass in 
iiny direction you please; a break will follow directions 
or iron. 

Another Way to Destroy Ants. 

Drop some quiek lime in the mofuth of their nest=^ 
and water it with boiling water. A sponge saturated 
with creosote will keep them from sideboards, pantries, 
etc. To keep them from climbing trees saturate a rag 
with creosote and tie around bottom of trunk of tree 
or paint a ring of tar around trunk. 

For Bed Bugs. 

•Slpirits off napthia rubbed into every part of bed- 
stead with paint .brush. Also go with same care- 
fully over mattress. Ten cents worth will' suffice for 
iseveral beds. Carbolic acid well put in crevices of 
bed with brush is also good.

Strainers. 

When yofur strainers have beooine clogged a lump 
of salt moistened and vigorously applied will prove 
effectual. 

To Clean Cut Glass. 

Wash the glass thoroughly in cold soap suds with 
a brush to which has been added a small lamount of 
ammonia and cover with sawdoist; as soon as sawdust 
is dry brush very carefully with rather soft brushy 
reachinpT all crevices. It will shine like diamond. 



'G 



Working Gown. 

A'fter a long experience I find for a work morning 
dress nothing equals white and black shephard's plaid 
in prints for sumimer and flannelette for winter. Both 
wash well and do not fade, always look d'ainty and is be- 
coming to all. 

To Repair Curtains. 

When pressing and a hole comes in curtain take 
piece of an old curtain a little larger than the hole 
and dip the edges in cold starch, then place over hole 
and iron over it. 

Keep Fruit Jars from Cracking. 

Place in the empty can a spoon that is long enough 
to reach from the bottom to the top of the can, pour 
in your boiling fruit, remove the spoon and seal. The

'can will not break. Please do not ask me the explain 
the philosophy of it, as I dislike very miioh to plead 
ignorance, so I hope that yon will ask some of the 
knowing ones in your vicinity and let me know the 
explanation. 

Make Paste Sticl\ 

When preparing paste to hang paper on white- 
washed wall, to every gallon of paste add one pint of 
vinegar, and there will be no trouble about the paper 
coming off. It will also save the labor of washing 
the walls with vinegar. 

Whei-e Ice Cannot he Had 

Butter may be kept cool in this way : Put it on a 
disih which has been placed in a shallow vessel of cold 
water, and cover with an inverted new earthen flower- 
pot. The pot should rest in the water. Oared for 
in this way butter, if put in the cellar or any other 
cool place, will keep hard even in hot weather. 

Hoiv to Tell When Lard is Hot Enough. 

To know when lard is just right for frying cakes, 
pass a match through the grease, and if it lights it, it 
is just right; if it does not, let it heat a little longer, 
and try again. 

A Closet Convenience. 

One of tjhe most eoinvenient articles one can have 
in a wardrobe or closet is a wide, padded cushion fast- 



Hirits For The Home. 259 

ened securely to the wdll, to which dress-skirts and 
other articles can be pinned. Mine is often fifteen 
iniches wide, three inches thick, and just long enough 
to fit in back of closet. I keep a row of Yery long 
pins sticking along upper edge, then use these to fasten 
folded dress and skirtbands in position. Arranged in 
thti's way, they retain their shape. The cushion sug- 
gests so many practical uses I wonder how I ever did 
without it. 

'Grass stains on white goods can usually be remo'ved 
in the following way : Wet the fabric, rub in some soft 
soap and as much baking soda as will adhere; let 
stand half an hour; wash out in the usual manner 
and stain will generally be gone. 

Using a Wliish-Broom to Clean Dishes. 

Is better than scraping them with a knife. Eight after 
clearing the table the brooan will be found useful for 
this purpose, especially if it is dampened occasionally. 
When the dishes are put in the dishpan there will be 
but little grease left on them. 

Ah out Lemons. 

Lemons may be kept fresh a long time by placing 
under an earthenware crock. 

A few drops of lemon juice put into boiling rice 
will keep the kernels distinct and make them very 
white.

Wash the hands and finger tips in lemon to remove 
all sorts of stains. 

A gargle of water and lemon juice will cure a sore

Castor oil taken in lemon juice is palatable. 

A few drops in fruit juice that does not want to 
jelley will bring about the desired results. 

A lemion in a dish of apples ot other fruit will 
impart a delightful bouquet to the fruit. 

After a shampoo rinse the hair in water that has 
some lemon juice in it. It will cut any grease that re- 
mains and render the scalp extra white. 

Lemon juice and sugar will clear the voice. Singers 
often eat an apple just before singing, as this helps also 
to make the voice have a clear and bell-like tone. 

Eiqual quantities of glycerine, lemon juice and rose- 
water make a soothing lotion for a sensative skin. It 
is equally as good for the hands. 

To remove %^g stains from spoons, rub with com- 
mion salt. 

Buttermilk used as a wash or m^ade into paste with 
talcum powder will remove redness of the skin. It 
should be washed off with very hot water. A splendid

Advice From an Economist. 

If you wish, to s^ve money keep an exact account 
of both inicomie and outgo. You may be surprised to 
discover how much money is spent in trifles if you caTe- 
f ally put down every cent at the end of the day. Charge 
accounts in shops are a great convenience if one can 
afford! them, but most people spend less when they pay 
for a purchase at the time than when they buy what they 
see and have the bill sent at the end of tlie month. A 
careful system of accounts will, however, help you to 
he frugal. 

To remove creases from silk spread on a clean iron- 
ing 'cloth, lay a damip doth over the crease place a S(jft 
paper over this and presis witli a warm iron. 

After removing all dust, wipe sicreen doors with 
kerosene and they will look new, as long a-s the 
odor remains mosquitoes and moth miillers wi'll give 
them a wide berth. 

If the dining rooim has become filled with cooking 
odors a few drops of the oil of lavender placed in a 
cup of boiling water will readily remove all traces 
of the cooking. 

Should yooir linoleum become worn and dull look- 
ing slcn^b it and .gfive it a coat of boiling linseed oil. 
After this thoroughly soaks in give one or two coiats of 
the best varnish. The linoleumi wild then look like new.

c titch around outside, also seTeral times through center ; 
use these and avoid burning your handis. 

To Drive Away Large Black A7its. 

Get five cents worth of tartar eimetic. Mix up half 
the quantity with sugar and water to a thin syrup. 
Put it in a little dish wherever they are troublesome. 
It will not only derive tliem^ away for that season, but 
they will not come back. We have tried it and the 
second season has brought no ants. 

To Keep Ice. 

In looking over the Mttle helps depairtment I find 
that no one has mention e'd the following, and I hope it 
may help others: To keep ice a long time, take six 
or eight newspapers, place them in the ice box, have the 
ice put on top, then wrap ice much as one would a shoe 
box or package; then if the ice box is not full, stuff 
well with crumpled paper around edges. The ice will 
last twice as long and do the same work. 

To Clean Brass. 

A simple and most satisfactory method of cleaning 
brass bedsteads, curtain-poles, andirons, etc., is to damp- 
en a cloth with amimonia, rub it briskly over a piece of 



Hints For The Home. 263 

pmndee soap, and then over the brass. This mixture 
acts like ma.gic. Have tried it on articles thought to be 
beyond redemption, so black had they become, w^hich, 
with the least effort, were restored to their original 
beauty. It is necessary only to dampen the cloth with 
ammonia and with a little pumice soap nib on the bra.s5, 
and the work is accomplished. 

A Nice Perfume. 

Oet a cotton batting to fit size trunk bottom and 
make silkoline cover and sprinkle 10 cents worth violet 
sache powder in cotton and your clothing will always 
have a dainty odor. 

To -Wash a Heavy Comfort and Rugs. 

Make a strong soap jelly with FelsHNaptha by 
shaving off as much as needed, and pour on 
enooigh water to dissolve and heat until dissolved., then 
spread comfort or rug on the porch floor and with a 
small stiff ibru^h apply the jelly to both sides of article 
and let soak in this for about one-half hour. Then hano- 
on clothes line and turn on horse with full force, turn- 
ing on all end'is and sides until it is thoroughly clean, 
and let it drain, turning every way, so the water will not 
settle in one end. This will not only get it beautifully 
clean ibut make the cotton light and fluffy as new, when 
otherwise it would be matted and sodded together and 
entirely unfit for use often washing the old way. I have 
thoroughly tried this and considier this recipe alone 
worth the price of the book.

A Good Home-Made Carpet and Rug Beater. 

Cut about three feet from an old wom-out garden 
hoise and slip one end over about two feet of broom 
handle and tie securely; €ut the other end of the hose in 
narrow strips, allowing" themi to hang loose from where 
tied to hiandle. This is an excellent beater and does not 
tear rusfs like sticks.

To WasJi Feather Pillows. 

Chooise a bright windy day; fill the tub with hot 
suds and plunge the pillows (with feathers) in them. 
Put them through seYeral waters, shaking them about 
briskly, then hang on the 'line in the open air. When 
perfectly dry shake well. They will be light, fresh and 
s^TOet. After they have been washed in this Wiay, they 
ou,ght to be hung out in the warm, fresh air every day 
for a week, but they must never be put directly in the 
hot sun, as the heat draws the oil out of the feathers and 
gives them an unpleasant odor. 

Care of Water-Bottles. 

We all know how hard it is to keep a water-bottle 
clean insidie. I have found that by putting a small 
handful of salt into the bottle and adding vinegar 
enough to moisten thoroughly, that after a vigorous 
shaking the bottle will become nice and clear, when 
it should be washed in a good warm suds, brushing the 
outside of the bottle and diying with a clean towel.

To Remove Blood Stains. 

Perliaps few people know that glycerine is a great 
aid in removing bloodi stains. Two teaspoonfoils in a 
qoiart of cold water will greatly facilitate the work of 
rubbing. 

To Prolong The Life of Sillc Skirts. 

W%en a silk petticoat has been worn two or three 
times it should be pressed with a hot iron to prevent the 
silk splitting. New creases will form each time it is 
pTessed in different places and the sdik will wear much 
longer. 

For Cleaning Wall Paper. 

■One quart of flour, one tablespoonful of pulverized 
alum'; mix together and stir in cold water until a litt'e 
thicker than pancake dough. Cook until it becomes st* 
thick you can't stir it any more, then mix in cracker 
crumbs until the doug'h doesn't stick to your fingers. 
Enb the pa.per lightly with this dough and it will ma^e 
it look like new. 

In Hotise-CleoMing Time. 

An easy way to carry carpets and beddin^g out doors 
is to roll them up and put a ti-nnik strap around the 
roll, slip the strap through the buckle and slide it down 
tight. I roll all the bedding up together and carry it 
very easy. A m^attress is handled the same way and 
one does not drag them on the ground.

Care of Carpet Sweeper. 

Twioe each week I remiove the dust from my 'Carpet 
sweeper, then with a oloth wet in kerosene I thorougthly 
wipe tiie brush. This not only cleans the brush excel- 
lently, but emo'Uigih oil clings to it to make it extra effi- 
cient in picking up d^ust from the floor, though not 
enough to injure the most d'elicate rug. 

To Mark a Key. 

When there are two or more keys on the key ring of 
approxim'ate size and appearance draw a file over the 
stem of the one most in use. This m'akes a nick which 
easily distinguishes it from the others. A little dent is 
better than a string or other mark, the key being easily 
recognized by it (in slipping it through one's fingers) 
in the dark. 

How To Siveeten Butter. 

If one has butter that is not entirely sweet, add to it 
a littHe more salt and a pinch of soda and bring to a

Sending a Bill By Mml.

Things To Rememher. 

:That delicate stomiachs that cannot digest ham, 
much less fresh pork, can assimilate thin slices of hrea-k- 
fast bacon. 

That, while creamed co-ffee is rank poison to some 
dyspeptics, nearly everybody is the better for a small 
cup of black coffee, taken after the heaviest meal of 
the day. 

That tliis same black coffee, dtrunk as hot as one 
can swallow it, is a prime remedy for nausea, from 
whatever cause. 

That matches should never be left in closed houses 
in paper boxes, since mice are 'paissionately fond of the 
tips, and often play the incendiary unintentionally. 

That bananas, peeled, dipped in egg, then rolled in 
cracker-dtist and baked in the oven, are more palatable 
and far more wholesome than when they aire fried in the 
ueual way. 

That the same may be said of croquettes. 

That if, in putting away papers and books which 
are not to be used for some months, you will poit cam- 
phoT balls or gum campho^r amonlg them, the mice will 
not touch them. 



268 The Model Housekeeper. 

That silver may be protected from tarnish in like 
manner. 

That almost any sooTch may be remio^ed from cloths 
(linen or cotton) by simrply was'hing and boiling in the 
usual way, and hanging in the hot sun while wet. 

That, when the fat takes fire on the stO'Ve, it is bet- 
ter to sacrifice a kitchen rug by throwing it upon the 
flame than to try to put it out by throwing water on 
it. The buiming grease will float farther, and blaze 
more fiercely from the water. 

All traces o'f mud can easily be rem'o'ved from Mack 
clothes by rubbing the spots with a raw potato cut in 
half. 

Fitting SJioes. 

People should never go in the early morning to get 
boots and ishoes fitted. In the latter part of the day the 
feet are at their maximum size. Activity and standing 
tend to enlarge the feet. If people would remember 
this rule there woiuld not be so many complaints of 
shoos when worn being tight, which when fitted seemed 
so comfortable. 

Shoe Polish. 

Most people thrown away boot piolisih when it gets 
hard through the lid being left off. Don't do this, but 
save the polish and place it on top of the stove, where it 
can gradually soften. 

Potato As A Pen Wiper. 

Keep a raw potato on your writing desk, and when

ttie pen needfe cleansing, stick it several times in suc- 
cession into the potato; yon will find that it works like 
a charm. 

A Good, Handy Paste. 

Take a cold boiled potato, cnt in two and rub on

Clean Paint Brush. 

To clean a dry, hard paint brush; pound it with a 
hammer until the bristles are broken apart, then use a 
comb to separate the bristles. The above will save any 
paint brush. 

Old Silk Leaves No Lint. 

Old, soft silk cloths make the best dlust rags for the 
parlor, as they leave no lint on polisOied furniture. 

Furniture Disinfectant. 

If any article of hjousehold furniture requires disin- 
fecting occasionally, it is a carpet; especially if it has 
been used a considterable time. The following is a 
method recommended hy a lady housekeeper, 'both as a 
disinfectant and a preventive of moths: Add three 
tablespoonfuls of turpentine to three quarts of water. 
Saturate a large sponge with, this mixture, squeeze it 
about two-thirds dry, and go over the carpet carefully. 
As often as the sponge becomes dirty cleanse it and 
take in a fresh supply of water.

Lamp Hints. 

To increase the light given by a small 'lamp, place a 
mirror diirectly back of it, so that your lamp casts its re- 
flection in the mirror. Yon can easily see just how 
miuch adiditional lig^ht you get from the mirror, by put- 
ting a paper between the lamp and the mirror, and sud- 
denly withdrawing it, noticing how much lighter the 
room is. 

A Furnace Hint. 

When, 'as often happens, a reigister refuses to send 
out a stream of hot air, if a lig<hted lamp or candle is 
placed on the register for ten or fifteen minutes the 
trouble will be remedied. The hoit air from the lamp 
starts a draft that -draws the cold air from the pipe. 

Vegetable Down Pillows. 

Thistle and dandelion down mixed with slender 
strips of fine tissue paper makes an excellent filling for 
sofa pillows. 

Fasten Rugs To Floor. 

If you find it hard to keep rugs or carpets smooth on 
the floor sew a loop on the corners of the carpet and 
■drive a sm^all tack into the floor at each corner. Place 
the loops over the tacks and in this way the rugs ca^. 
be kept in place without ruining the floor. 

To Iron Shirt Opening. 

To iron the opening in a wash skirt neatly, fold a

l.^i^' i J ;. 

cloth four or six times to make a pad. Slip the pad 
under the hooks or huttons and iron. This does not 
flatten tlie hooks and makes neat, smooth-looking open- 
ing. 

To Remove Dampness. 
Place in the cellar a large open hox or pan contain- 
ing fresh lime. This dries and purifies the air. Lime 
should be changed as it becomes air-slaked. 

Tallow Removes Ink. 
Place the ink spot in 'ho't melted tallow, let dool 
and wash the articles in the usual way. For colored 
goods or such as will not wash well, 'drop the taillow on 
the spot, let it harden and then remove it. If a shadow 
remains, put a piece of blotting paper on the spot and 
press with a hot iron. This takes all tihe ink out. 

Particles in the Eye. 
If a speck or a splinter gets into the ev^e, simply lift 
the eye lid and blow yo'ur nose, when tlie particles will 
be forced out. 

Sweeten Onion Breath. 

The disagreeable odor left after eating onions may 
be prevented by drinking half a cup of hot water in 
whic^h a pinch of soda has been dissolved or by swallow-

Curing a Kicking Covj. 

Pass a rope around the cow's body just in font of

babies* 



The first thing is to see if the child is breathing 
properly and the heart beating all right, and if it fails 
to do this it must be stimulated artificially. First wipe 
the mouth and throat clean with a soft, clean cloth 
over the finger dipped in warm water. This is to re- 
move the mucous which might obstruct the air passages. 
.Spirinkle its face with cold water and slap it gently 
on back, limbs and arms. If this should fail to arouse 
it dip feet in cold then in hot water to shake it just 
for an instant in the cold and then in hot water 
for one or two minutes about 110 degrees Fahr. ; then 
rub briskly with fiannel until perfectly dry. Be care- 
ful not to let the child get chilly. Babies need a great 
deal of warmth at first. Some noted physicians will 
not have the baby waslhed for several hours after birth 
but to remove a little slimy substance with which they 
are usually covered; have it well greased with sweet 
oil and gently rubbed off with an old soft cloth. For 
a very weak child this is all the bath required at first, 
except in all eases to wash the eyes thoroughly in a 
weak so'luion of boric acid. When room, is ready 
to give baby its bath it should be given in warm places 
and test water with the elbow to which the water should 
feel just pleasantly warm. The child may be left in 
until skin begins to flush. Take him out in a warm 

272

blanket. Dry him tihoroiighly and put him to bed, 
Ten chances to one he will be all right. Fmm this 
time on the baby sJiould have a bath every morning 
and given a good dusting with Mennen's talcum as 
this is known to be the purest made and it is not safe 
to use a powder you are not familiar with on the tender 
skin of infants. Fresh, dry cotton should he put on the 
cord every day until it falls off which it iviil do in 
aibout a week; boric acid is a good dressing. iCottoii 
diapers are best and sihouLd never be used after once 
wet until tlhey are washed and always be very particu- 
lar to have all the soap well rinsed out and never use 
'bluing in diapers. At first the bowels should move 
two or three times daily. The mecorium and water 
passes during the first twenty-four hours. If the latter 
fails to occur apply a hot strip over the kidneys. The 
child's breast will sometimes be swollen and full of 
milk for a few days after birth. This may make the 
baby a little feverish but will usually grad:ually dis- 
apipear without treatment. jHowiever, it is well to 
bathe the breasts in a little weak camphor water and 
grease them with vaseline. A child a month old should 
sleep twenty hours out of twenty-four without being 
ro-cked or carried about. Hahits will be easily ac- 
quired at this age. You can teach the baiby even at 
this age never to soil a diaper by holding him out over 
his little chamber at regular times early in the morn- 
ing just after nursing and if he should not take to it 
at fiTst use a piece of castile soap about three inches 
long trimmed about the size of a slate pencil for about 



274 The Model Hovseheeper. 

two and one-half inches and leave larger at one end 
for handle. Use this for a while and you will in two 
or three times have no further trouble. This will save 
untold trouble and never fails. I have seen it tried in 
many cases. 

Mother's milk as a rule is to be preferred to all 
others, but fai'ling in this, the nearest approach is 
cow's milk. Milk from a single cow is no longer recom- 
mendied, as the average from a well-cared for herd is 
more uniform in quality. Sugar of milk is best for 
sweetening and boiled water should be about one part 
to two parts milk. Let the infant nurse directly from 
sterilized hottle, using a clean, black rubber nippde of 
which it is best to always have two on hand, alternately 
daily, keeping the other in weak solution of soda w^ater 
w^hen U'ot in use, and always keep bottles not in use 
full of clean water and rinse again just before using. 
After use rinse first then wash in hot soap suds. A 
child is often rendered restless by thirst and will be 
quieted by a little clear, cold water which hould be 
given at least twice a day. After eight or ten months 
the daily meal should not exceed six in number. An 
allowance of bread and milk or beef tea may be given 
but it should not come to depend on solid food until all 
the teeth are cut. 

Keep the little one in the open air as much as possi- 
ble suitably clothed. If the gums are very painful and 
swollen it may be necessary to have them lanced.

Colic. 

Tlie wind colic of infants seldom requires medical 
treatment. It is proibably due to unsuitable food or 
in care of nursing infant to the consideration of the 
mother. Do not .give soothing syrups. Eubbing and 
the ap'plication O'f hot flannels to the abdomen will 
usually relieve it. A little hot water flavored with 
peppermint or anise may ])e given and if this fails try 
two or three drops of gin in hot water. These remarks 
are taken from a noted work of Clara ^Vheeler Shaw. 

Babies should not be disturbed in the least while 
nursing and should nurse quict'ly for at least twenty 
minutes. If you will wait and nurse him at regular 
intervals he will do this. 

Mennen's Talcum. 

There is nothing so essential to baby's toilet a? 
talcum powder and nothing that should be selected 
with more scrupulous care, for an inferior powder used 
on the veiy sensitive skin of an infant often prove.^ 
extremely injurious — ^but the old true and tried "Men- 
nens" is always safe, sure and effectual and can safely 
be relied upon in every instance. It is not only heal- 
ing, cooling and soothing, but it will really prevent 
those annoying, itching, burning eruptions if its use is 
persisted in. In fact, no mother should ever be with- 
out a l)ox of '^Mennen's Talcum" in the house. I must 
also mention that it is equally good for older people 
as it beautifies and preserves the skin, no matter what 



276 The Model Housekeeper. 

tlie exposctire of the wind and sun may be; a generous 
application of tfhis p'owcler before and after exposure 
will prevent sunburn, prickly heat and in fact, all sum- 
mer annoyances. There is nothing so cooling as a 
liberal dusting over the entire body after the bath and 
it also removes any sticky sensation and gives that 
velvety touch so much desired by everyone. 

• Un<co'ohed Eggs as Food. 

An Austrian physician has called attention to the 
value of uncooked eggs as food for growing children. 

Of all the soibstances found in the animal organism, 
albumen seems to me the one most directly concerned 
with the phenomena of growth and development. Its 
value as a food' is correspondingly great, and is not suf- 
ficiently appreciated. 

In the artifi'cial feeding of children this should be 
borne in mind. The white of the raw egg is the most 
available form in which we can find albumen, and it 
should be used in the preparation of most of the foods 
for children. 

Free albumen is one of the most easily digested 
substances, and is rapidly made use of by the muscle 
cells. 

It is a valuable food for adults as well as for infants. 

Croup. 

A very wet towel with very cold water wrapped 
around the neck and chest will cure the worst case of 
croup in five minutes. This is much better than drugs, 



Babies. 277 

as it does not debilitate. Hot water is sometimes reoom- 
mended, ibut cold water is mTich quicker and effective; 
it breaks up tbe congestion at once. 

Stammering. 

Make the child take a deep breath before every 
word or sylJable. If a child is taught to breathe pro})- 
crly stammering may often be overcome. 

Cand^i/. 

One or two small pieces of peppermint or molasses 
candy or a igumdrop may be allowed after a meal, 
several times a week, without doing the average child 
any harm. It is when children are given rich or im- 
pure candies in quantities that bad results are almost 
sure to follow. Children should not be allowed to 
spend their pocket-money on candy; what little they 
have should be carefully selected for them by th.eir 
parents and given to them in the proper amounts and 
at the right time. 

Hiccoughs. 

If the baby has the hiccoughs, moisten a little sugar 
wdth a drop of vinegar and feed it. 

Regular Habits. 
Yes, it is better to begin now than later. Place 
him on his cbair every morning after feeding at ex- 
actly the same time, and if he does not understand why 
you do this, use a soap stick or a little cone of oiled 
paper to start him. 



278 The Model Honseheeper. 

Bowels. 

Watch the bahy's movements carefully, and at the 
first sign of anything nnusual — in increased number, 
eo'lor or consistency — give a teaspoonful of . castor oil; 
sto,p all milk, and give harley-water or rice-water in- 
stead, for a day, at least, until the movements lo'ok 
natural again; then when 3'OU resume the milk give 
one ounce of barley-water before each nurbing, and 
nurse at first for only five minutes, gradually working 
back to the usual method. The same plan should be 
followed in regard to the food if the baby is sudldenly 
taken with vomiting. While the baby is not taking 
the breast milk this will have to be drawn off with a 
breast-pump. 

As you cannot get out of the city for the summer 
you must try to give your baby the best and freshe>t 
air you can get in town. Leave the housework until 
later in the day, and take the baby out very early in 
the morning — from six until eight or nine is a good 
time — ^then spend the hottest p^art of the day in the 
house, where he need have very little on and enjoy his 
frequent sponge baths. In the late afternoon, from five 
until seven, is another good time to take the baby oul, 
b'ut after the dew^ begins to fall it is best to be in the 
house. If you are within reach of recreation piers, can 
take a day on the water or a long, cool trolley-ride into 
ihe suburbs, by all means take advantage of these things ; 
tliey will do much to keep your baby well during the 
summer. Eemember that your arms are very heating 



Babies. ^^'9 

to a baby, and keep him out of them all you can during 
the warm weather. 

Another point to bear in mind is the early removal 
of soiled clothing. Do not leave soiled napkins nor 
underwear about even for a minute. Have a covered 
pail with a little water and mild disinfectant in it, and 
just as soon as you remove a soiled diaper from the 
baby put it at once into this pail and cover it until 
you have time to wash it properly ; be sure not to place 
it on the floor or on a cliair where flies may light on 
it and carry the germs of disease to the next person 
on whom they alight. These may seem small points, 
ibut they mean a great deal to the baby in warm weather. 

Croup. 

Croup can be cured in one minute, and the remedy 
is simply alum and sugar. Take a knife or grater, 
and shave off in small particles about a teaspoonful of: 
alum, mix it with twice its quantity of sugar to make 
it palatable, and administer it as quickly as possible. 
Almost instantaneous relief will follow. 

Summer Diarrhoea In Bottle-Fed Babies. 

First of all stop all milk at once, as this acts like 
a poison while the child is suffering from diarrhoea. 
Give one or two teaspoonfuls of castor-oil to remove any 
iiritating matter that may be present in the intestines. 
Give plenty of pure, cool water that has been first 
boiled. The child may take this from a bottle, spoon, 
glass or medicine-dropper. For food give the albumin- 



280 The Model Housekeeper. 

water mentioned on this page if the baby vomits much, 
or else give barley, wheat or rice water, if the child 
can keep these down. To make these waters or gruels 
take one teaspoonful of the fliour, mix it into a smooth 
paste with a little cool water; then add in to one pint 
of boiling water which has a pinch of salt in it, and 
boil for twenty minutes, 'adding enough water at the 
end of that time to make up the pint (for some will 
have boiled away) ; strain and give to the child in his 
nursing-bottle, feeding the proper number of ounces 
for a baby of his age every two ot three ho'urs. As the 
child grows a little better the igruels may be made 
'.stronger. The next step is to add a very little milk 
to the gruels. Usually one ounce of milk to a pint of 
gruel may be taken, then, little by little, add more 
milk until the baby is again back on his original for- 
mula. When milk: is added to the gruel it is best to 
ad;d also some limewater — about one ounce of the lime 
water for each twenty ounces of the food. You should 
always call a doctor to see the baby as soon as possi- 
ble, but you should stop the milk and give the castor- 
oi] at once, without waiting until he can arrive. 

Giving Medicine. 

The most nauseous physic may be given to children 
without trouble by previously letting them suck a pep- 
permint lozenge, a piece of .alum of a bit of orange 
• peel. 'Many people make the mistake of giving a 
sweet aftei'wards to take away the disagreeable taste; 't 
is far better to destroy it in the first instance. 



Babies. 281 

Exercise Pen. 

An exercise pen would be just the thing for a 
baby. This is rather expensive, however, so if you 
do not care to purchase one get a large drygoodis box 
deep enough so that bahy's head just comes above the 
sides when he stands up. If the hoards are rough have 
them planed off so no splinters will get in the little 
hands and knees; then give baby a toy or two, put a 
pad in the bottom of the box and let him amuse him- 
self on the piazza while 3^ou are at work. He will get 
plenty of exercise andi fresh air in tiliis way, and you 
will not have to watch him constantly. 

Feeding Baby Teething. 

Give such a ba)by pure boiled water^ and do not try 
to force food until he shows some inclination for it. 

Thirst In Infants. 

Thirst in the infant is nearly always mistaken for 
hunger. Give your crying child a little cool (prefer- 
ably boiled) water, using cup or spoon, or try tiny 
pieces of ice tied in a scrap of lawn and .see if it does 
not prove the very thing needed. Six or seven times 
every day the babies should be offered drink; it regu- 
lates the bowels, cleanses the mouth and stomach, and 
prevents in a measure overfeeding 

Whooping Cough. 

Whooping cough is a very common and infectious 



S82 The Model Housekeeper. 

disease. Children of all ages may .contract it, but young 
babies are especiailly liable to have it if| exposed. From 
the very beginning of the first stage whooping cough 
may be given to others, and while there is tihe least 
whoop it isi very) cofiiitagious. iGeneraily it is best 
to keep a child with whooping cough away from other 
children for two months. It is very rarely carried by 
8. third person or by means of clothing. After ex- 
posure one m.ay expect a child to come down with 
w^hooping cough at any time from' seven to sixteen days. 
No distinct cure for 'who'opdng cough has been 
found, and as a rule drugs do more harm by upsetting 
the stomach than good in relieving the cough. The 
chief thing to be considered is to keep the child as well 
nourished as possible and give him plenty of pure, 
fresh air. If possible it is well to take him away for a 
complete change of air; this will sometimes consider- 
ably lessen the duration of the disease. At any rate, 
tlie child should spend as much time as possible in the 
open air every day and sleep in a well- ventilated room at 
night. 

The question of giving the child sufficient nourish- 
ment is often a serious one, because so m.uch food will 
be vomited. It may be necessary to feed the child a 
little more frequently than when he is well. After a 
paroxysm of coughing, when the mucous has been ex- 
pelled, and perhaps any food that has been in the 
stomach at that time, a glass of milk or some broth witb 
perhaps a little zwieback — if the child is old enough to 
take it — may be given and will many times remain 



Babies. 233 

down, because another paroxysm is not likely to occur 
right away. Food which is easily digested and which 
contains the most nourishment should be chosen. In- 
fants may he given peptonized milk in place of the 
usual formula, as this will he digested more rapidly 
U the child seems to be losing strength it may be nec- 
essary to give some form of predigested beef beside 
the regular meals. 

Pacifiers. 

Physicians and nurses who treat babies agree +iiat 
paeifiers are the cause of many ills. The constant 
suction on the nipple produces enlargment of the ton- 
sils and promotes the gmwth of adenoids; catarrh soon 
follows, then a chain of evils, ehief among which is 
deafness. It is very easy for catarrh to extend from 
the nose and throat into the little tube that connects 
these organs with the ear, and the catarrhal deafness 
that may then occur is one of the most frequent forms 
and also the most hopeless to treat. If unclean objects 
are put into the mouth there is also great danger of 
germs finding their way through this little tube into 
the ear, and an abscess, with possible destruction of the 
drum, is likely to follow. 

A^umerous other diseases may be caused by the paci- 
fier; sprue or thrush is often directly traced to its use. 
Con-stant suction overworks the little glands in the 
mouth that produce saliva,. and a-ll this liquid that is 
intended to be mixed with the food and help di^es: \t 
is wasted on tlie pacifier, so that Avhen it is needed for 



'^84 Tlie Model Housekee'per. 

tShe food there is little left; indigestioii .and chronic 
dyspepsia follows. 

I am sure if mothers realized the dangers of allow- 
ing their babies to form "the pacifier habit" the manu- 
facturers would soon eease to pTodnce these articles, as 
there would be absolutely no call for them in the shops. 
It lies in the hands of mothers to put a stop to this 
evil. 

Stockings. 

[JnlesiS you want your baby to have poor digestion 
■and colic you should cover up the little legs with long 
woolen stockings pinned to the diaper. 

Constipation. 

Try to regulate the bowels by means of food rather 
than medicine. Bran gems, prune jelly and graham 
mush are all good laxatives, and might be enough 
without anything else. 

Vomiting in Warm Weather. 

Try albumen-water given in small quantities and 
very cold. To make it take the white of one fresh Qggy 
half a pint of cold water and a pinch of salt; place in 
a bottle and shake all well together; strain if any 
specks are seen. 'At first try only one tea;spoonful of 
this at a time, and if the child retains it then gradually' 
frive more.

The ^ Diet of the Nursing Mother. 

'Cabbage and! tomatoes are not generally well di- 
gested by a nursing mother, and hence have some bad 
effects on the baby, but, as a rule, other vegetables 
and melons do no harm. A baby should be about six 
nionths old (before prune juice is given.

Advice on Poisons. 

In all cases of poisoning is to empty the stomacli 
as freely and speedily as possible. For this purpos*? 
you may use a tablespoonfnl mustard and salt in a 
tumbler of warm water or any other emetic you havo 
on hand. Spices taken in large doses. Acids when 
swallowed burn the throat and produce violent effects 
on the stoma'ch. When you suspect that any of these 
have been swallowed, give a cupful of sweet oil, melted 
butter or lard, or you may give common soap in solu- 
tion and .afterward give an active emetic of ground 
mustard, salt and water. If you suspect nitric or 
oxalic acid as the poison, give lump magnesia or chalk 
and water. 

Alkalies are counteracted by swallowing common 
vinegar, any kind of oil of grease converts and alkalis 
into a soap which is harmless to the patient. Hence in 
these cases you can give oils, -butter, lard, etc. Arsenic. 
— 'Give any of the oils, fats or magnesia in very large 
quantities. Opium and other narcotics. — If you sus- 
pect overdoses of opium, morphine, laudanum, para- 
goric or other narcotic, give a quick emetic at once; 
m'ustard and warm water or pulverized alum or any 
other powerful emetic should be given at once. If the 

286 



Home Doctor. 287 

patient should become drowsy keep him in motion; 
dve very strong coffee; ctash cohl wfiter upon the face 
and shoulders and u.-=e eohl applicati'ons up and down 
the spine. 

Gravel. 

One pint of water, two ounces bicarbonate of soda. 
Take two tablespoonfuls in the early forenoon and the 
same amount toward night. Drink very freely of 
water during the day. Inflammation of the kidneys 
has been successfully treated wdth large doses of lime- 
water. Persons troubled with kidney difficulties should 
abstain from sugar, starchy food and sweet vegetables. 

Sore Throat. 

'Simple remedies are best. Alum and honey dis- 
solved in sage tea and used hot as a gargle is splendid 
tor sore throat. Also applicaotions of cloths wrung 
(mi of very hot water and applied to the neck, changing 
often, is good to remove inflammation. During the 
evening is best for applying this remedy and should 
be kept up for an hour or more. 

Astlima. 

Powdered licorice root, powdered elecompane root, 
powedered anise seed, each one drachm, powdered ipecac 
ten 'grains, powdered lobelier ten grains; add sufficient 
amount of tar to form into pills of ordinary size. 
Take three or four pills on going to bed at night. Aiv 
excellent remedy for asthema or shortness of breatli. 



288 The Model Homeheeper. 

Cinders from the Eye. 

Put one OT two grains of flaxseed which can he 
placed in the eye without pain or injury. As they 
dissolve a glutinous substance is formed which envel- 
opes .any foreign body that may be under the lid and 
the whole is easily washed out. 

8unstrolce. 

Wxap la wet cloth bandage over the head, wet another 
cloth folded smiall square, cover it thichly with salt and 
bind it on the back of the neck. Rub dry salt briskly 
behind ithe ears. Put mustard-plasters to calves of legs 
and soles of feet. This is an effectual remedy. 

Drowning. 

As soon as body is recovered it should be stripped 
of all clothing, rapidly dried, placed in a bed previously 
warmed, the head, neck and shoulders raised, a little 
friction with the dry hands used to the extremities and 
heated flannels kept applied to the rest of the body. 
To restore breathing place the person flat on the face, 
press gently on the back then turn the body on its side, 
then turn lagain on the face, press again on the back and 
turn again on the side. This should be done about 
sixteen times a minute. 

Vinegar for Rheumatism. 

A case cured in my own immediate family by taking 
one-third glass pure apple vinegar half hour before 



Home Doctor. 289 

,each meal was cured sound and well. A very severe 
case where the patient had scarcely been able to walk 
for nine months. Cure was completed in thirty days 
and distcardied crutches in ten days. 

Milk Leg. 

I have known milk leg of many years standing to 
be cured by using dry beech leaves ; white beech is best. 
Get those that hang on the trees after the leaves fall. 
Boil them and use the water to bathe the sore then bind 
on the boiled leaves. Change them often at first. 

Bed Sores. 

There will be no danger of bed sores if you will 
bathe the tender skin with alcohol every day. But if 
they have already developed put the whites of an egg 
in a (Cup, cover with alcohol, apply several times a day. 
The alcohol stimulates and hardens the skin. The 
whites of eggs forms a coating which excludes the air. 
Calomel is also good to dust on to dry up sore and in 
bad cases a pinch of burnt -alum added to egg and al- 
cohol helps, as it draws out inflammation and being a 
stringent helps also to dry it up. Boracic acid is also 
good to dust on after bathing with alcohol. 

Strawherries for Teeth. 

Strawberries are fine as a dentrifice. Take two or 
three real fresh, ripe strawberries, crush them and rub 
your teeth with them five or six minutes a day. The 



'i'90 The Model Hotisel-eeper. 

improvements begin at once and in a short time they 
will be white and lustrious as pearls. 

Whooping Cough. 

Mix equal parts linseed oil, black molasses with 
sprinkle of sulphur. A teaspoonful every coughing 
spell. 

Disinfectant 

Which will sweeten the whole place may be made for 
ten cents. One pound of c-opperas, eight ounces crude 
carbolic acid dissolved in one gallon of water. Use 
frequently. 

Rheumatism. 

This information said a well-know physician to 
me will prove an invaluable boon to people suffering 
from rheumatism in any form. Twenty-five cents worth 
of oil of wintergreen; put ten drops on a lump of 
sugar, place in the mouth and let it dissolve slowly 
then swallow it. This should be repeated every two 
hours until every vestage of the malady has dis- 
appeared. In the meantime take a few doses of Eo- 
chelle salts. This said the physisian, if taken as I 
have prescribed, will save suffering humanity many dol- 
lars. 

Hiccoughs. 

A lump of sugar moistened with vinegar. In ten 
cases tried as an experiment, stopped hiccoughs in nine. 



Home Doctor. 291 

Insect Bites. 

The juice of raw onions applied to stings and bites 
will desitroy the poison. 

Pnemnonia. 

This remedy I am told has heen known to cure 
the worst cases of pneumonia. Apply sweet oil to iha 
chest, then cover quickly with powdered lovelia, then 
'cover this with .se\'<?ral thicknesses of very hot flannel. 

Poisdn. 

Put common pins in all hottle corks marked poison 
Stick them (through ibottom of cork allowing ijhe points 
to protrude beyond the corks. ■ You will then never pick 
up such a bottle in the dark. 

Water in Sick Room. 

Always keep an open basin or bucket of water in 
sleeping room and sick room. It will absorb all im- 
purities of the atmosphere. The water should be re- 
moved every twelve hours; when it will be found the 
oifensiveness of aitmosphere has been entirely removed. 

Nose Bleeding. 

A lump of ice held against the nostril or against 
back of neck or a bunch of cold keys dropped down the 
back will often stop nose bleeding. 

Nose Bleeding. 
Snuff powdered alum through nostrils. 



292 The Model Hoiiselceeper. 

Plaster. 

A mustard plaster mixed with, white of an egg 
will not blister. 

Spine Curbatwre. 

Ourbature of the spine in ebildren often result f roiu 
sleeping on pillows that are too high. 

Flux. 

Fill a tnmbler one-half full of apple vinegar, put 
a teaspoonful each of Crab Orchard and Epsom salts and 
a tablespoonful of table salt. Take a taMespoonful every 
hour until six does have been taken and then every two 
hours and you'll be well before you know it. 

Sick Room. 

Essence of cinnamon when exposed in sickroom 
will kill bacilli which are floating around. 

Bee Sting. 

Ammonia and peppermint mixed equal quantities is 
fine for bee sting. 

Stop Spread of Diseases. 

Carry through 3^our rooms every few hours a shovel 
of live coals which has been sprinkled well with sulphur. 

Croup Treated hy Sulphur. 
M. Lagauterie gives in croup teaspoonful doeses, 



Home Doctor. 293 

every hour, of a mixture of sulphur and water (a tea- 
spoonful to a glass of water) with effects which he de- 
scribes as wonderful. The cure, in seven severe cases, 
was accomplished in two days, the only symptom re- 
maining being a sligiht cough. An observation of the 
effect of sulphur on the cidium of vines, led to its use 
in croup. 

Cholera Cure. 

An excellent recipe, and, if taken in the first stages, 
an infallible one, is a mixture of powdered ipecac root 
and carbonate of ammonia. Was successfully used in 
the midst of an epidemic of cholera in 1849. 

To Cure Salt Rheum. 

I will say that I have known salt rheum to be cured 
by using a bajtter made of corn meal and vinegar, spread 
on the disease parts and renewed twice a day. When 
it becomes dry it can be wet up with vinegar. 

Cut it Out. 

The Scientific-American gives this recipe, which the 
whole world ought to know: ^^At the first indication 
of diphtheria in the throat of a child make the room 
close, then take a tin cup and .pour into a quantity of 
tar and turpentine, equal parts. Then hold the cup 
over a fire, so as to fill the room with fumes. The little 
patient on inhaling the fumes will coug'h up and spit out 
all the membranous matted, and diphtheria pass out. 
The fumes of the tar and turpentine loose the matter in 



394 The Model Housekeeper. 

the throat and thus afford the relief that has bafBed the 
skill of physicians." 

To Prevent Felons. 

The following directions, carefully observed, will 
prevent those cuticular and osseous abominations known 
as felons. As soon as the disease is felt, put directly 
over the stpot a fiy blister, abcut the size of your thumb 
nail, and let it remain for six hours, at the expiration 
■of which time, directly under the surface of the blister, 
may be seen the felon, which can instantly be taken out 
with the point of a needle or lancet. 

Consumption. 

Let even the despairing use strong mullein tea 
freely, sweetened with brown sugar. In a week they 
will feel better; in a few months they will be well. 

Styptic for Bleeding Wounds. 

If puff-balls are not convenient apply dry flour of 
any kind bound on with bandage. In absence of baking- 
sod:a (carbonate) flour is excellent for burns or soalds. 

For Dysentenf. 

Take leaves and roots O'f blackberry-plant. Boil to 
a deep color. One gill before each meal-time and on 
going to bed. 

Cancer. 
Use tea made of red clover tops. 'Boil until strong. 



Home Doctor. 295 

Use, las a drink, a quart a day; and use the same kind 
of tea, made stronger, for a wash twice a day. 

Remedy for Bite of Mad Dogs. 

A saxon forester named Gastell, now of the vener- 
able age of 82, unwil'ling to take to the grave with him 
a secret of so much importance, has made public in 
the Leipsic Journal the means which he has used for 
fifty years, and wherewith he affirms he has rescued 
many human beings and cattle from the fearful death 
of hydrophobia. Take immediately warm vinegar or 
tepid water, wash the wound clean therewith, and then 
dry it; then pour upon the wound a few drops of hy- 
drochloric acid, because mineral acids destroy the poison 
of the saliva, by which means the latter is neutralized. 

Catarrh. 

Get an ounce of menthol crystals and put a pinch 
of them in any small vessel, tin cup will answer, and 
pour over them six tablespoonfuls of hot water. Inhale 
the vapor which arises through the mouth and then 
close mouth and nostrils, holding the nose tightly be- 
tween thumb and finger and blow as if to force the 
vapor out of the mouth and nose, but keep them closed. 
This action will drive the vapor into all the air passages 
and afford relief. 

Pulsations. 

Normally, the number of pulsations per minute 
differs at different periods of life; at birth, it is about 



296 The Model Housekeeper. 

135 ; at the age of seven, from 80 to 85 ; in adults, 70 
to 75; in old age, 50 to 65. In females, the pulse is 
quicker than in males. 

AstHngent Lotion. 

Eo'se water, six ounces; elderflow^r water, two 
ounces; simple itineture of benzmn, one-half ounce; tan- 
nic acid, ten grains. 

For the girls who always have clammy cold hands, 
this w^ash is said to he good. 

For Damp Hands. 

Cologne, four ounces; tincture of belladonna, one- 
half ounce. 

A tea of white oak bark applied to perspiring spots 
is said to be a famous skin specialist to be effective 
in stopping the undue perspiration. 

Bunion Remedy. 

U'se pulverized saltpetre and sweet oil; obtain at 
the druggist's five or six cents' worth of saltpetre; put 
into a bottle with sufficient olive oil to nearly dissolve 
it; shake up well, and rub the inflamed joints at 
night and morning, and more frequently if painful. 
This is a well-tried remedy. 

Health Resorts for the Tuberculous. 

Aiccording to manj^' physicians there is less danger 



Home Doctor. 297 

of (Contracting pulmonary tuberculosis in a well-regu- 
lated health resort than elsewhere. The climatic con- 
ditions of such resorts are good. Then, too, there is 
a greater average degree of sanitary knowledge and pre- 
caution among all frequenters of such modem resorts 
than elsewhere. The open^mr life, through ventila- 
tion, wise diet and eareful attention to sputum all aid 
in rendering these localities comparatively safe for 
visitors. 

Microbes on Trailing Skirts. 

It was recently stated that a bit of cloth cut from 
the bottom of a long skirt harbored 16,500,000 microbes. 
In this army were many tubenle bacilli. Tn Prague, 
as stated .by the same authority, a prohibition against 
long skirts is being enforced, since it is believed that 
by these garments germs are disseminated. 

How to Take Castor Oil. 

An emulsion ean easily be made by ipouring into a 
bottle, first, very hot milk, then the castor oil — two- 
thirds milk, one- third oil. Shake the bottle until an 
emulsion results. In this form the oil is easily taken 
in nearly all oases. 

Sore Nipples. 

White of an egg mixed with a little brandy is the 
best application for sore nipples. Apply often and 
wear nipple shields while baby is nursing. 



298 The Model Househeeper. 

Caked Breast. 

Finest thing in the world after first hathing the 
breast for some time in ver}' strong tea as hot as can 
possibly be borne. Miake a dough of warm fionr and 
warm, strong apple vinegar and lard, about as for 
bisicuit, and roll about one-half inch thick a piece large 
enough to entirely cover the breast. Put on as warm 
as can be borne. Change to fresh one when it begins 
to get dly. This never fails to soften cake so milk 
can be pumped out. 

Puffs Under Eyes. 

Puffy places under the eyes are generally due to 
some kidney trouble. Water should be taken very freely. 
Drink a glass of water about half hour before each 
meal and one about two hours after and the puffy places 
will not only vanish but the complexion will be cleared 
and the general health much improved. 

Bad Odors. 

Fumigate with coffee, vinegar. Should there be a 
bad odor in house or sick room from cooking vegetables 
or otherwise, take a shovel full of live coals and carry 
through the house with windows down and doors closed, 
sprinkle over these coals ground coffee or vinegar, and 
to make a sweet odor sprinkle coals -ftdth cloves and 
spices or a little sachet powder or toilet water. 

Nap Each Day. 

B\^ery"one should take a rest in the afternoon, but 



Home Doctor. 299 

the woman who does not relax herself does not rest 
no matter liow long she lies. To relax properly, la}/ 
at full lengih on back, the head level with body, the 
arms extended slightly from the body and feet separa- 
ted about six inches. The clothing should be all 
loosened. Do some abdominal and chest breathing. 
Then beginning with the head relax all the muscles 
of the whole body — this is to release the tension on them 
so that if feet and hands were lifted they would fall 
to bed like logs of wood, then make an effort to relax 
mind as much as possible. 

Tea. 

Rheumatics should never drink tea. I have known 
persons who were slaves to tea-drinking to be entirely 
relieved by giving it up. However, there is nothing 
better to take inflammation from boils, sore eyes or 
in fact, whenever there is swelling or inflamm-ation. 
than bathing the parts in very strong, hot tea. 

Scott's Emulsion. 

I would feel that I had done my patrons a great 
injustice to close this department without saying a' 
vrord for the old reliable household remedy "Scott's 
Emulsion. It is not only a positive cure for coughs 
colds and all pulmonary troubles, but as a tonic for 
run-down constitutions and flesh builder, it has no 
equal and I believe if taken in time and persisted in 
its regular use it will stop the ravage of consumption. 
It is well to take in connection for piilmonars^ affec- 



300 The Model Housekeeper. 

tions a strong cup of mullen tea taken either oold or 
hot, a teiacnpful several times a day. I hope that 
others may be benefited by my experience in the use 
of "S'cott's Elmulsion^^ and when affected with the 
above-mentioned troubles give it a thorough triah 



Flat Irons. 

Flat iron rubbed on salt and then on a rag several 
thicknessies moistened with coial oil will become quite 
smooth. 

For Feet When Ironing. 

When ironing, if worker stand on several thicknesses 
of old quilt or blanket tacked together or padded rug, 
the feet do not become tired. 

Fruit Stains. 

Fruit stains can be removed by first washing articles 
in coal oil then rinse in usuial way. 

Dress Skirts 

When washed, do not wring, hut hang them dripping 
wet on the line by belt. The weight at the bottom 
keeps skirt from shrinking and also keeps it an even 
length. 

SprinMing. 

Always sprinkle your clothes with smiall whisk- 
broom' and in real hot water. They will iron more 
easily and ha^-e a much smoother finish. 

301 



302 The Model House'keeper. 

Ironing Board. 

To keep ironing board clean make a bag of heavy 
cotton or drilling with draw string run in top and 
liang up when not in use. 

Time Saver, 

One can save labor and time by hanging fiat things 
•such as sheets and towels straight on line. Put four 
corners exactly even and give two or three flaps up 
and down. Take down w4th care when dry and fold 
carefully and pack away one on top of another; blank- 
ets and counterpanes oan be served the same way. A 
good Wiay is to smooth each fold nicely with the hands. 
After laying a day or two you would think they had 
been ironed. One, too, can save much ironing to form 
the habit of wearing plain or knitted underwear in- 
stead of much trimmed garments, also save time and 
expense hy m^aking children's clothes plainer and they 
are really in much better taste and very much more 
becoming than the much befrilled garments. 

Bleach Clothes. 

To 'bleach badly-washed clothes and will also remove 
most all kinds of stains mildew, etc : Dissolve one 
pound of soda and five cents worth of chloride of lime 
into about one gallon of rain or cistern water. Then 
stnain through a cloth. After washing clothes in one 
good suds, dip them up and down several times in this 
hot solution, then rinse thoroughly in two waters and 



Laundry Hints. 303 

your clothes will be beautifully white if carefully 
rinsed. 

To \Yash With Machine. 

The one called "Up-to-date," according to my opin- 
ion is the best for family purposes. At least after using 
it several years I am still delighted with it. Take 
one bar of Fels N"aptha soap, shave into a small pan 
and 2>our over hot water and let dissolve, add a 
handful of soda to this and when cold it will form 
a jelly. Put your clothes into soak the night before 
into warm rain or cistern water, soap well with this 
jelly, especially all soiled places, roll up and put in 
water each piece separately. iSText morning wring out 
lightly and put in real hot water made soapy with Fels 
N"aphtha soap, turn each machine for about three min- 
utes and rinse blue and hang out your clothes. Will 
be much nicer than hand washed. 

Starch. 

Mix starch with enough cold water to about con- 
sistency of cream, add a shaving of hard, white soap, 
a teaspoonful of coal oil or lard, this will prevent it 
from sticking to irons and give a nice gloss. Stir this 
mixture into a vessel of boiling water, stirring con- 
stantly for about three minutes, strain and it is ready 
for use. 

To Laundry Corsets. 

Much more satisfactory to wash than dry clean. 



304 The Model Hotisekeeper. 

Spread it on board or wo'oden table one-half at a time 
and fasten securely with thumb tacks. Then soap well 
with Fels JSTaptha soap, then scrub with small scrub- 
brush in hot water. Scrub each section in turn np 
and down, rinse in lukewarm water in which add a 
little bluing. Dry as quickly as possible. 

Try Washing Flannels Like This Rule. 

Make good suds of white soap in warm water (not 
boiling) and wash the flannel underwear in this water 
apart from everything else. Do not rub soap on the 
garments, or they will be hard and stiff. Wash well 
through two waters prepared the same way; then rinse 
in warm water to which a little bluing has been added. 
After rinsing thoroughly wring them out w^ll, shake 
them, and spread on the clothesline. While they are 
drying shake ,&tretch and turn them from time to time. 
They should dry slowly. Flannels washed in this way 
will keep soft and shrink but little. 

To Keep Comforts Clean 

One woman makes her sheets about eight inches longer 
than those generally used, having a two-inch hem 
on one edge; then she works three small buttonholes in 
the hem, one in the center, and the other two about 
fourteen inches from the center, on each side. On the 
comforter she sews three small buttons about eight 
inches from the top and the same distance apart as the 
buttonholes in the sheets. When the bed is made up 
every morning the upper sheet is turned over and but- 



Laundry Hints. 305 

toned to th^ comforter, so that the sheet is always next 
to tlie face of the sleeper. 

Washing Blankets and Woolens. 

To wash blanJvets and woolens : Take one-half of a 
bar of Fels-Naptha soap; shave it very fine. 
Pour over it a pint of boiling water, and put upon the 
fire and stir until it becomes a thick paste. Into this 
put one tablespoon of borax and two tablespoon fuls of 
liimmonia .Have ready a tub of tepid water softened 
with a tablespoonful of borax. Stir into this the soap 
mixture then put in the articles you wish cleaned. 
Let them soak an hour, occasionally turning them over ; 
then run through a wringer. After this rinse through 
clear, tepid' water being careiful never to rub with the 
hands. Eun through the Avringer again, and hang in 
the SJim to dry. When nearly dry, iron. 

Blankets washed by this recipe are as soft as when 
new. Shawls, flannel dresses, in fact all woolen goods, 
it will wash beautifully. 

To Starch Dark-Colored Lawns. 

Some people have trouble starching dark lawns be- 
cause the starch will show. To avoid this, use ffuim- 
arable. To starch a dress, take one heaping teaspoonful 
of gum-arabic. Dissolve in a little warm water, then 
add enough water to wet the dress. This makes it 
crisp and it can be ironed in the same way as other 
starched goods. 

A teaspoonful of turpentine put in boiler when 



306 The Model Househeeper. 

9 
boiling white clothes, will keep them snow white and 
remove the dingy look about neck-bands, wrist-bands, 
etc. 

Add a little pulverized borax to starch while cook- 
ing; it will give a gloss and prevent it from sticking 
to irons. 

When washing white flannels, have the water you 
rinse them in very blue and they will not become yellow. 
Add 'borax to water you wash and rinse them in, using 
rather warm water for both, and your flannels will al- 
ways be white and soft. 

In washing knit or crocheted articles, squeeze in- 
stead of wringing, and dry by laying on a clean towel, 
turning often, and they will be as nice as when new 
and will retain their shape. Do not hang on line. 

Laundering Embroidery. 

Mercerized cotton, especially the white, wash bet- 
ter than embroidery silks. No matter how good a silk 
you buy it will not stand having soap rubbed upon it. 
Hot water is equally injurious. So is ironing with a 
too hot iron. 

M'ake a thick suds of warm water and pure soap 
and rinse the pieces to be washed. Squeeze through the 
hands and do not rub on a board. 

Einse in clear water of the same temperature as the 
first. 'Squeeze ooit as much as possoble of the moisture 
with the hands and do not rub on a board. Pull into 
shape and roll in a thick towel to absorb the excess 
water. Then take a smooth piece of d^imp muslin and 



Laundry Hints. 307 

place it over the back of the embroidery an'd do the 
ironing through that. 

\Yhen Pressing Dark Garments 

Cover the ironing-'board for the time with some dark 
lining material. Otherwise, sometimes after the gar- 
ment has been dampened and pressed on the usual white 
•cover white blotches are seen, owing to the starch on tho 
cover. The dark cover also keeps the usual white one 
clean. , 

Starch. 

To improve starch, add a tablespoonful of epsom 
salts, and dissolve in the usual way by boiling. Ar- 
ticles starched with this will be stiffer, and rendered, 
to a certain extent, fireproof. 

Flannelette. 

After flannelette articles have been washed, they 
should be rinsed in water in which one onee of alum or 
sal ammoniac has been dissolved'. This little precaution 
will make them non-inflammable, and may be the means 
of saving many little lives. 

To Remove Grease. 

To remove grease from garments dissolve a teaspoon- 
ful of salt in four tablespoonfuls of alcohol, shake well 
and apply with a sponge. 



308 The Model Housel'eeper, 

Scorch. 

Sborch stains on white cloth, which are the work 
of a .careless ironer, may be removed, it is said, by 
soaking the doth in lukeiwarm water, squeezing lemon 
juice on it, and sprinkling a little salt over it, and 
laying it in the hot sun to bleach. 

Turpentine. • 

A little turpentine ad'ded as they boil will whiten 
and sweeten clothes without injuring the mosit delicate 
fabric. For garments very much soiled use a spoon- 
full of kerosene. 



Sewing ^oom IKints. 

Even Your Own Shirt Edge. 

Finish the sldrt at the top, put it on just as you 
would wear it. Eub chalk on the e'do^e of a dininor table 
and, standing against the table, turn around so the 
chalk mark will encircle the skirt. Take off the skirt 
and measure from the chalk mark an equal distance 
all around to the hem. The chalk miark being well 
below the hips, the difference in length will be above 
that. 

Improving a Cheap ^Ya^st. 

I have found that the most economdcal and satis- 
factory way of obtaining a hand-embroidered shirtwaist 
is to purchase a ready-made waist with miachine em- 
broidered design and work over the embroidery by hand, 
thus saving stamping, padding and making the waist. 
A bJoaise embroidered in this way will deceive the 
most expert needlewomian. 

Strong Buttonholes. 

To make (buttonholes strong in children's clothes, 
work over ordinary soft wrapping com, hold it on the 
inside as near edge as possible and it will not show 
when buttonhole is done. 

Oil Shrinks Machine Belt. 

When sewing machine band becomes too loose, do 

309 



310 The Model Housekeeper. 

not cut but put a few drops of castor oil on and revolve 
rapidly a few seconds. 

Economy of Labor. 

From garments that have been kid aside, cut the 
strip containing the buttonholes, leaving enough of 
the material to turn under. Use this strip as a "fly" 
to new garments, thereby saving both time and labor. 
My little girl has quite long hair, and as buttonholes 
are a bug-bear to me, and I had to cover the buttons 
to protect here hair, I devised this method or reserving 
my patience, and at the same time miaking the same 
amount of labor do double duty. 

Lengthening Washable Skirts. 

It wash dresses are made before they are shrunk it 
is often necessary to let out the hem after being washed. 
If, hoi\wver, a tuck is ran in by hand on the under 
side of the hem, the truck can very quickly be taken 
out and there is not anofclier hem to be put in as wooild 
be the case if the hem had to be ripped. 

Some Sewing Hints. 

Use cotton tape for binding plackets of small child- 
ren's drawers — one piece for each placket. They never 
tear if this is done. 

Keep a stiletto on your machine — it turns under the 
edges of hems and fells like magic; besides being useful 
in many other ways. 

Sew in sleeves of thin waists in a French seam. 



Sewing Room Hints. 311 

stitching twice the last time. TMs is not so heavy as 
binding. 

For Gaping Skirts. 

Kere is a simple but excellent remedy for gaping 
skirt vents, an untidy condition which is so hard to 
avoid after skirt has become stretdhe>d from sitting in 
it. Before sewing on hook, place a piece of tape or 
libbon at least as wide as the hook, underneath it. 
Sew securely, and then stretch tape over to next seam 
and tack flat, being careful to have tape just the same 
length as the space of skirt between the seam and back 
opening. When the skirt is closed, it will stay closed 
and neat. 

The Parisian method of cleaning black silk is to 
brush and wipe it thoroughly, lay it on a flat table, 
with side up which is intended to show and sponge 
with hot coffee, strained through maislin. A'llow it 
tn become partially dry, then iron. 

For Sewing Harsh Goods. 

It is very hard to sew harsh goods, as calico. Need- 
les break very easily. This difficulty may be overcome 
by rubbing the hem or seam with a dry piece of soap, 
when the needle will penetrate easily. Thi.-. plan is 
good for both machine and hand work. 

Removing Shine From Serge, Etc. 

I have always been troubled with my skirts, espec- 
ially serge skirts, becoming slick and shiny looking, be- 



312 Tlie Model Housekeeper. 

fore they were near worn out. To remedy this, place 
the skirt on la board and rub the shdny places with sand- 
paper, not too hard, but just enough to rough up the 
nap. A'fter pressing, the skirt will look as good as 
new. 

Beneiving Petticoats. 

In either making or buying a petticoat, have it two 
inches longer than required length. Put in a one inch 
tuick, up above hem, in skirt which takes up the two 
inches. When the bottom ruffle or the hem of skirt 
wears, let down the tuck, eut off ruffle or hem, and hem 
up, and you have a nice, clean skirt again, as the bot- 
tom always wears first. 

Hemming Napkins. 

In hemming napkins, a small, even hem can be ob- 
tained by running the edge of napkin to me hemmed 
through the smallest hemmer of the machine, without 
being threaded. 'Press the hem back and overcast, plac- 
ing stitches close. This is more rapid than the old 
way and' saves pricking the finger. 

Clean Old Cloak. 

It is not always necessary to send light cloth coiats 
or cloaks to the cleaners whenever they appear a little 
soiled by s'moke and dust. A successful method of re- 
3n.oving surface dirt consists in rubbing the material 
with equal parts of oatmeal and whitning applied with 
a piece of flannel. The coat should be well shaken, and 



Sewing Room Hints. 313 

the same application repeated once or twice, until the 
cloth looks perfectly clean. AfteT shaiking it once 
more, it should be pressed on the wrong side with a 

warm iron. 

Lace. 

There are two well-known recipes for cleandng white 
silk lace. One is to wind it around a piece of wood like 
a piece of broom handle, or glass bottle, and to soak it 
all night in warm castile soapsuds and milk; rinse in 
warm water, soak in soap and warm water; rinse again 
without rubbing, bleach in the sun and dry. The 
second method recommends that the lace be spread out 
upon whit© paper, covered with calcined magnesia; 
another sheet of paper placed upon it, and laid awa} 
for three days between the pages of a large book ; then 
shake off the powder, and the lace will be clean and 

wliite. 

To he Ready for Next Christmas. 

Take a little notebook, attach it by a string to your 
desk OT some other place where you will see it through 
the year, anid in the book allow a page for each of those 
to whom you give Christmas presents. Try to get some 
gifts or to make some every month. When you have 
done this, cross off in tlie book the names of those for 
whiom you have provided. When the holiday season 
comes again if you have followed this plan you will find 
that you have more satisfactory gifts, and felt less worry 
in getting them ready, and incidentally have saved 
some expense.

Negligee Shirts. 

There is entirely too much good material in clis- 
,carded negligee shirts to throiw theta into the rag bag. 
A good way is to cut off the fringed edges of cuffs and 
turn under edges and stiitch around and out off worn 
co'llar and replace with band to be worn with separate 
collar. It may also cut into a one-piece dress for a 
little tot and it will make a child a nice sack apron 
with S'leeves. Cut front of apron out of back of shirt 
■and back out of front. Use top part of sleeves for 
apron sleeves. It is wise when selecting shirts' to get 
good material with small figure and to get more than 
one alike. W)ould furnish material for a nice school 
dress for larger girl. 

Insertion. 

A delicate insertion which is beginning to show 
signs of wear can be made to last twice as long by a 
lining of thin brussels net. If any part of lace is 
much worn, darn it down to lining net. 

To Restore Rusty Black Lace. 

Half cup rain water, one teaspoonful borax, one 
teasipoonful alcohol; squeeze the lace through this fo^ir 
times, then rinse in a cup of hot water in which a 
black kid glove has been boiled; pull out the edges of 
the lace till almost dry; then press for two days be- 
tween the leaves of a heavy book. 



Sewing Room Hints. 315 

To Prolong the Life of a Taffeta Petticoat 

Line it with a thin muslin. The lining should be cut 
the same as the outside breadths and sewed up 
with them. It is remarkable how much longer such 
a skirt will last than one miade up in the usual way, 
unlined. 

Renovate Skirt. 

An old black skirt may be soiccessfully cleaned as 
follows: First of all, brush and shake it well to get 
rid of the dust, then brush carefully all over with a 
good hard clothes brush dipped in malt vinegar, using 
plenty of the vinegar. The skirt should then be hung 
out in the air for lan hour to dry, and then pressed 
on the wrong side over a damp cloth. The ordinary 
serge or cloth skirt will be found to look like new after 
this treatment. 

Black Silk. 

That "shininess^' m'ay be removed from old black 
silk by sponging the fabric well with goo'd cider vinegar. 

Cleaning Hat. 

'Get out your la&t season's straw hat and try fresh- 
ening and cleaning it at home with lemon. Remove the 
band an'd lay the hat on a flat surface to keeip the brim 
in shape. Cut a lemon in two crosswise lan.d rub th^

straw with it. Wipe the hat with a soft, clean cloth, 
and if the dirt and stains have not all been removed, 
•repeat the operation with a fresh piece of lean on. 
Allow the hat to dry thoroughly before it is worn in 
the sun. 

''Button Strip'' for Shirtwaists 

Will be found practical and economical. Work a set of 
buttonholes — usually {out — on the under hem, and a 
corresponding set on the top plait of }X)ur shirtwaist; 
then sew the buttons on a strip of cloth the length of 
the waist front, buttoning it to the under hem. When 
your shirtwaist is ready for the wash remove the but- 
ton strip. One set of buttons ^\all do duty for several 
waisfts. The buttons will retain their new look, and 
will not be ironed off at the Laundry. 

Make Over Stockings. 

If the feet of wx)men's stockings or fair-sized child- 
ren's stockings ibecome worn, they can be cut off and 
made over for baby. Take one of baby^s stockings as 
a pattern and cut by it. Then run a seam up the back 
on the machine and you have a nice pair of stockings 
for baby. 

To Keep Patterns Neat. 

The cardiboard tube 15 inches long and about two 
inches in diameter in which you receive your magazine 



Sewing Boom Hints. 317 

may be cut in half and in eacli of these a pattern may 
be rolled and kept. The tubes may be marked on the 
outside with a blue pencil and slipped into a drawer 
for convenience. 

To Hold Fattenis on Goods. 

Lay paper patterns on the goods and pres/s them 
witli a warm iron. This makes them stay in place 
while cutting out without pinning. 

Make Gloves Wear Longer. 

Place a little cotton in the finger tips. Some peo- 
ple turn the tips wrong side out and place a piece of 
court-plaster over the end. 

Baby Bibs. 

Dress shields make good bibs for baby to wear under 
the dainty whites ones. iCiit in two and bind at the 
top. One shield makes t\\''o bibs. 

Prevent Skirts From Sagging. 

When making a circular skirt, finish all but the 
lower edge and hang up for a few days. After that 
length of time it can be safely turned up, as it will 
have stretched as much as possible. 



318 The Model Housekeeper. 

Firm Button Holes. 

When making button holes in goodis that ravel, be 
careful to make the button lno'le the right size. Then 
have hot wax ready and dip a hot knife into it, and 
run at once through the hole. Not one thread will 
ravel and the button holes will be nice and firm. Take 
your stitches 'after the wax is cold. 

Or, after you cut the 'button holes, se^v aronnd them 
Dear the edge with the sewing machine. The}' will 
never come out. 

To Lengilien Child's Dress. 

Olpen the shoulder seam and insert a strip of ma- 
terial like that used for the waist. This gives the 
needed space in the arm hole and around the neck. It 
is easier and more quickly done than ripping tucks or 
facing the hems. It is cheaper than to buy trimming 
and it leaves any tTimming that may be on the waist 
or skirt untouched, and yet the waist is lengthened, 
leaving the gathers of the skirt in their proper places. 

Strengthen Corsets. 

Sew two or three thiciknesses of mtislin to corset 
where the belt or skirt supporter pins on. This will 
keep the corset from tearing and can be changed when 
worn out. 



Sewing Room Hints. 319 

Old Gloves. 

Bura'ble covers for sofa pillows or cbair cushions 
for old ladies are being mado of the' wrists of old gloves ; 
only strong pieces shO'Uld he worked in. Clean thor- 
oughly with gasoline then have pattern oif stiff card- 
board and cut each piece with care and exactness. The 
best 'design is hexagon. A (pleasing effect can be worked 
out of 'all light shades in center and dark outside or 
simply hit-iand-miss ^pattern. Join pieces on wrong side 
by overcasting, using strong waxed thread and a reg- 
ular glove needle. Line back of cushion with a bright 
sa.teen or silk lining. 

Apron. 

Make a good apron of oil cloth and note saving of 
dirty aprons. 



Stomach Trouble. 

Stomach trouble in 'any form can be cured in al- 
most every case if this remedy is persisted in. For 
dyspepsia, indigestion, fermentation, etc. If you are 
weak in mornings, have brought to your bed one hour 
before breakfast one pint of hot water just as hot as 
you can possibly sip it, with one-ifo'urth teas-poonful 
each salt and soda and a generous sprinkle of red pep- 
per. Have a small glass especially ifox the purpose 
set beside your plate and first thing when setting down 
to each meal pour about two tablespoons of milk into 
the glass and stir in one-fourfth teaspoonful of cay- 
enne pepper and drink before taking any food. This 
arouses the secretions of fclie stomiach. Then eat a light 
breakfast of very brown toast tand soft boiled Qgg and 
whatever cereal agrees witli you, but Quaker Eolled Oats 
suited my case exactly and they always form the best 
and most essential part of my breakfast and I believe 
from my owti experience that almost any stomach can 
assimulate Quaker Oats and there is no.thing more 
noairising. Again one hour before dinner drink one pint 
of hot water prepared in same way as for breakfast. If 
your digesttion is too weak for most foods nothing can 
take the place Oif raw oysters made very hot with red 
pepper. I lived on them myself six weeks after a three 
months' strictly milk diet, and gained in health 

320 



Home Remedies. 321 

and strength every day. Take hot w-ater before supper 
and at bed time prepared same as above. This will 
surely relieve you and length of time for taking must 
be govorened by seriousness of trouble. 

For Inactive Liver. 

Broken doses of salts often proves effectual. Make 
up a tumbler of water with one and one-^haM tablespoon- 
luls of Crab Ordiard salts and let it stand long enough 
to dissolve. 

Every tw-o hours take a tabiestpoonful of mixture. 
Keep this up for ten days and rest ten days and be- 
gin again and so on until relieved. There is a brine 
made from the salts sold at Crab Orchard Springs 
whicli is much superior to the salts and I would ad- 
vise the use of this when possible, which you can se- 
cure by writing to the present owner, iMr. J. B. Willis, 
and for stomach trouble there is no better remedy on 
the market. In fact, to spend a few wrecks at this fa- 
mous old resort and drink this brine in connection with 
the waters fresh from the springs will cure stomadi 
trouble in its most aggravated form. 

To Remove Moles and Warts. 

Crack a snail and dip finger in slime and apply 
three nights in succession and mole and warts will dis- 
appear. 

Goiter. 

Said to remove goiter on neck. Eub juice out of 
grape-fruit, apply until it disappea.rs. 



322 The Model Housekeeper. 

Chapped Hands. 

Instead of washing hande in soap use oat meal and 
dry the hands witli oatmeal after each washing instead 
of using towel. 

Cover Corns. 

Take common yellow laundry soap and dampen until 
.soft enougih to form a paste and apiply to corn night 
and morning in form of poultice. It will sure come 
off with a few applications. 

Bad Breath. 

The very best thing for this is oonceaitraited solutioQ 
O'f chloride of soda from six to ten drops in wineglassful 
/of fresh water. Take last thing after yo^u have made 
your toilet and on going to bed and if the mouth is 
well rinsed iwith a teaapoonfoil of chloride in tumbler 
of water the bad odor oif the teeth will be removed. 

Lyon Brand Wine. 

While I am strictly temperate myself. I realize that 
there are a great many run-do!wn and anemic constitu- 
tions tliat require the appetizing and stimulating effeet 
of a reliable brand of wine which, however, should be 
selecited with the utmost care, else the effect would be 
quite the opposite from the one desired. I would ad- 
vise in every instance possible to secure a California 
wine 'Called the Lyon Brand. It is not only the 
purest and most wholesome wine in use,, but 



Home Eemedies. 323 

is soild "under a guarantee of being well aged 
and made from tlie 'freshest and puresit Galiifomia 
.fruits. For medicinal as well as all otlier purposes 
for which wine is used it has no equal; having that 
rich, mellow flavor so much soug^iit and sio difficult to 
find. It can he obtained of H. 'G-rossman, Fountain 
Square, Cincinnati, Ohio, who also handles a very- 
superior brand or ripe olives and olive oil. I dare 
say after once using H. Grossman's goods you'll never 
want any other. 

Hiccoughs 

May be relieved 'by tailing nine swallows of water 
withouit taking a breath, or eating a piece of ice or 
by taking a pindi of snuff. 

Heart Burn. 

An agreeable drink for heart burn. Juice of lemon 
ew^eetened to taste, a level teaspoonful of soda, put in 
three-founth tumbler of water and stir in lemon and 
sugar. Drinik while elfervescinor.

Fever Blister. 

Ajfiter mopping 'witli a piece of raw cotton dipped 
in sweet spirits of niter they will disappear like magic. 

Neuralgia. 

Fold a large towel several times and wring out of 
very hot water to which has been added one heaping 
taible&poon of Epsom salts to each quart of water. 
Apply to affeicte'd: part; repeat heating as itcools by re- 
turning to fire. This will often relieve both toothache 
and neuralgia when other measures fail. 

Dojit Catch Cold. 

Whenever you begin to feel s.ymptonisi of taking 
cold, chilling, sihivering, sneezing, etc., you may be sure 
the blood is going from the surface and internal con- 
gestion has begun which so often causes serious re- 
■su'lts. Begin riglit ijhen to take most vigorous exercise. 
Walking, sweeping, jumping, running, wood-chopping, 
and anj-'thing that will get up a brisk circulation. Drink 
in connection a pint of hottest water possible, made 
strong with red pepper and as a rule your cold is 
ended hardily before it began. Try this by all means. 
It never fails if begun in time. 

Hot Milk 

Is the finest stimulant known when one is tried, ner- 
vous and cold nothing heilps so much as a pint of very 
hot milk siped as hot as can be borne at bed time. 



Home Remedies. 325 

Cold Feet. 

Rub the feet and limbs ev^ry morning with damp 
salt and rinse with cold water. Di-y with a towel that 
has been wrung out of strong brine and dried which 
will! be rough with salt. Rub vigorously with this rough 
towel the entire limbs and feet until in a perfect glow. 
This will cure cold feet entirely. 

Anxiety acts as a poison and produces the same ef- 
fect 'as other poisons. Worry raises the blood pressure 
?nd is very injurious to health and good looks. 

Stch Headache 

Is often relieved by taking a tablespoonful of lemon 
juice in one-half glass of very hot water about one-half 
hour before meals and at bed time. 

Hoarseness, 

Beat the white of an egg until stiff; add juice of 
one lelnon and a tablespoonful of honey or sugar. This 
mixture aifords much relief in hoarseness. 

To Prevent a Sneeze. 

My mother taught me this way to shut off a sneeze, 
and I have been spared embarrassment and mortifica- 
tion by remembering it. When you feel an inclination 
to sneeze lay the forefinger across the upper lip, close 
under the nose, and press down hard. 

Cramps. 

For stomach cramp®, ginger ale or a teaspoonful of 



326 The Model Houselcceper. 

the tincture af ginger in a half-glass of water in which 
half a iteaspoonfn'l of soda has been ddssolved. 

Stye on the Eyelid. 

Put a teasipoonful of black tea in a small bag ; pour 
on it enough boiling water to onioisten iit; put it on 
the eye pretty w^anm. Keep it on all nig'ht, and in the 
morning the stye will most likely be gone; if not, a 
second application is soire to remove it. 

Poison Oak. 

A standing antidote for poison by paison oak, ivy, 
etc., is to take a handful oif quicklime, dissolve in water, 
let it stand half an hour, then ipaint the pants with it. 
Three or four applications, it is said, will cure the 
most aggravated cases. 

Sich Stomach. 

When a person is "siek at the stomiaich," ice taken 
into the mouth in small pieces and allowed to melt be- 
fore swallowing will, in many instances, relieve tho 
discomfort. 

Diarrhoea. 

Boil one-half pint fresh milk, after cool stir in one 
tablespoonfnl of flour; drink cold. A simiple but fine 
remedy. 

Sand Bag. 

One of the most convenient articles for sick room 



Home Remedies. 327 

is a sand bag. Get nice, clean sand and dry it on 
stove in a pan, make a bag about eight inches square 
of flannel, fill it with dry sand; sew opening -carefully 
together, cover this with bed ticking or heavy linen to 
prevent sand from sifting out and also enable you to 
heat bag quiekly by placing it over or on top of stove. 
After using this you will never want a water-bottle or 
hot iron again. 

Earache. 

Roast an onion, put a few d^ops of laudanum and 
sweet oil upon it while warm, press the juice into the 
ear while warm and stop it will wool; bind the warm 
onion to the ear. 

Congestive Chills. 

Give /from ten to fifteen drops of spirits of turpen- 
tine in a wineglass of toddy; make a liniment of equal 
quantities of turpentine and camphor, with this rub 
the spine, chest and extremities well, but not enough 
to blister; rub until reaction takes place; a cloth satu- 
ratefdi with the mixture should be placed on the chest. 

Chronic Diarrhoea. 

Drink tea m^ade of orange peel sweetened with loaf 
sugar, and use as a common drink 24 to 36 hours. 

Neuralgia. 

If you have a case of neuralgia gradually coming 
on, remaining at its height for a time, and gradually 



328 The Model Housekeeper. 

leiaving, take a dose O'f starmum and you will certaiiiily 
relieve yooirself in a sliort time, and the neuralgia will 
not return. 

Remedy for Chilhlains. 

One egg, well-beaten; diluted acetic acid, eight 
ounces; spirits of camphor, one ounce; oil of turpen- 
tine, half an ounce; tincture of arnica, one dirachm. 
Soak the affected parts in hot water and dry them, 
shake the lotion well, rub it in well, and 'allow to dry 
before the fire. 

To Cure a Felon on the Hand. 

Take sassafras bark — ^the inside bark — dry, ami 
grate it fine, and wet in a teacuip' of cold water for a 
poultice. Apply to the felon and wet once in five min- 
utes in cold water. This, followed up, will dtraw it to 
a head' in twenty-four hours, without any pain and 
without injury to the hand. Use the bark of the root. 

Diphtheria. 

Sulphur will kill any fungus growith such as the 
poison of diphtheria makes in tlie throat. 

One teasipoonful of flour of sulphur, mixed with % 
little water and used as a gargle, or still better, blown 
into tihe throat in the dry state, through a quill oi' 
a bit of writing paper rolled in a simall tube form. 
Dip the end of the quill in the pow'dered brimstone 
until it holds pei^haps half a teas^poonful ; placing the 
sulphur end in the child's mouth, taking the other end

in yours, give a quidk, short blow of your breath, anrl 
the sulphur is applieid. 

A physician in one of our large cities whb has never 
lost a case of diphtheria, takes nothing else as a remedy 
on his round's but the quill and the sulphur. 

Salve. 

The follo^ving is a fine salve for burns and cuts 
or sores of long standing: Take equal parts of melted 
bees'vvax, mutton siuet, pulverized rosin, burnt alum, 
honey, venice of turpentine, sweet oil ; cook over a slow 
fire all together, stir until it commences to thicken then 
strain through a cloth and pour in earthen pots. 

Mint Jnlip for Nausea. 

Put a few sprigs of fresh mint in the bottom of a 
tumbler, if convenient add a teaapoo-niful of cracked

suffar in enouojh water to fill the tumbler half full, 
add a wineglass of good brandy; stir in well and pour 
O'ver the mint, g*ive this in small quantities; put a 
mustard plaster on the stomach.

Hydroplioljia. 

The cure of that terrible disease known as hyrdo- 
ph/obia is a very simple one — one within the reach of 
all; that the poor man as well as the rich, may easily 
obtain. It is of itself a powerful vegetable poison. 
But it possesses those counteracting properties necessary 
to annul the poison that exists in the disease, hydro- 
phobia. This remedy you know as the herb lobelia — 
nothing more. Tie the leaves we't with warm water, 
applied to the wound if there be any, and give of the 
toa, miade very strong, till the patiient experiences a 
thorough change, and the (muscular system has come 
under influence of the remedy. Medical men inform 
us that it will not prodluce vomiting when the disease 
hydrophobia is upon the system, but it will act as a 
powerful agent in neutralizing the (poison, which is of 
an opposite character to itself, and will, they tell us, 
in nine cases out of ten, prove thoroughly effectual 
given before the seco^nd spasm seizes the patient. Aifter 
that it is not so sure. But before that, it is always, 
they tell us, la sure remedy. Now treasure this little bit 
of knowledge, every one of you, for you do not know 
how soon you may have need of it.

A Cure for Inflammatory Rheumatism. 

1 have found cold applications the most effectual. In- 
dian meal and cold water poultice, kept wet and cool, 
will stop its progress and break it up quicker than any 
other application. And now for a remedy to 
drive it from the system, with all its kindreid — neural- 
gia, siciatica and lumbago — for they all are kindred and 
will succumb to the same treatment. When poke ber- 
ries are ripe, gather enough to fill a pint botltle. They 
miust not be bruised. Fill the bottle with good fourth 
proof whis'ky. Let it stand where it will keep warm 
forty-eight hours, when it is ready for use Dose, a 
teaapoonfiil three times a day. 

Cure for Hf/dro phobia. 

A G-erman forest-keeper, sixty-two years of age, not 
wishing to carry to the grave with him an important 
secret, has published in the Leipzig Journal a recipe 
he has used for forty years, and w'hich, he says, has 
saved several men and a great nuimber of animals from 
a horrible death from hydTophobia. The bite must be 
ba:thed as soon as possible with warm vinegar 'anid water, 
and when this has dried, a few drops of muriatic acid 
poured upon, the wound w^ill destroy the ipoison of the 
saliva, and relieve the patient from all present or fu- 
ture danger.

abo'ut the size of a pea. Place in a half -pint bottle, pour 
in enongli strong cider vinegar to fill the bottle; shake 
well and let standi until dissolved. Apply on cloth 
carefully, as it will stain. Will cure salt rheum, fel- 
ons, etc. 

The Care of Ears. 

Never pult anything initio the ear for the relief of 
toothache. 

Never wear cotton in the ears if they are discharg- 
ing pus. 

Never attemfpt to 'apply a poultice to the inside of 
the canal of the ear. 

Never use anything but a syringe and warm watei" 
for cleaning the ears from pus. 

Never strike or box a child's ears; this has been 
known to rupture the drum and cause incurable deaf- 
ness. 

Never wet the hair if you have any tendency to 
deafness ; wear an oil-silk cap when bathing, and refrain 
from bathing. 

Never scratch the ears with anything but the finger 
lips if they itch. Do not use the head of a pin, hair- 
pins, pencil tips, or anything of that nature. 

Never let the feet become cold and damip, or sit 



Home Remedies. 333 

with the back towards a window, as these things tend 
to aggravate any existing h^irdness of hearing. 

'Never put milk, fat or any oily substance into the 
ear for the relief of pain, for they soon become rancid 
an-d tend to incite inflammation. iSimple warm water 
will ansiwer the purpose better than anjrthing else. 

Never be alaTm,ed if a living insect enters the ear. 
Pouring warm water into the canal will drown it, when 
it will generally come to the surface, and can be easily 
removed by the fingers. A few puffs oif smoke blown 
into the ear will stupefy the insect. 

Never imedd'le with the ear if a foreign body, sucli 
as a bead, button or seed, enters it; leave it absolutely 
alone, but have a physician attend to it. More damage 
has been done by injudicious attempts at the extraction 
of a foreign body than could ever come from its pres- 
ence in the ear. — Health and Home. 

Nervous spasms are usually relieved by a little salt 
taken into the mouth and allowed to dissolve. 

Chlorate of potash dissolved in water is a standard 
remedy for sore throat, particularly if the throat feels

Sleeplessness caused by too Tnuch blood in the head

Medicated Blackherry Cordial. 

A correspondent of the 'Christian Advocate has sent 
to that paper the follwv^ing recipe of medicated black- 
berry cordial, which she says was obtained from a cele- 
brated physician in the lower part of the State, and has 
been used with great success: Two quarts blackberry 
juice, one pound loiaf sugar, half ounce nutmeg, half 
ounce cinnamon, half ounce cloves, quarter ounce all- 
spice and one pint brandy. Pulverize the spices and 
add to the juice, and boil for a short time. When cold 
add the branidy. Keep in a cool place. Dose, from 
a teaspoonful to wine glass, according to age. 

The Value of Olive Oil 

As a med'icino is not sufficiently appreciated. I know 
from exiperience what it does for rheumatism; a tea- 
spoonful three times a day before meals will prevent 
its return. The oil dissolves the calcareous matter and 
eliminates it ifrom the system. It will arouse a torpid 
liver, therefore improve the complexion. It will in- 
crease flesh, and is even beneficial when applied ex- 
ternally. The "olive-oil cure" is especially soothing to 
the nerves, and, in fact, seemB to be an "all-round" cure. 



Home Remedies. 335 

For an Obstinate Cough, 

Liquid pitcli (tar) twenty drops; sweet spirits of 
nitre, one drachm; simple syrup, two ounces. 'Mix. 
When the cough is troublesome, taJ^e a teaspoonful 
night and morning. 

Gravel. 

Alcohol, one quart; bruise juniper berries, three 
ounces. 'Let stand, after thorough shaking, one hour; 
then bruise peeled onions and fill the bottle; let stand 
for a week; strain and take a tablespoonful three times 
per day, in same quantity of water. Eat of raw and 
boiled onions, asparagus and spinach plentifully. 

Inflammation of the Bowels. 

Perfect rest in bed; light nourishing diet; no warm 
,dTinks; bowels at first moved with doise O'f castor oil. 
If pains, put over them hot flax-seed poultices, and take 
off when cold; rub then with warm flannel gently down- 
ward. Patient can drink of "Fever Drink." 

Hysterics. 

This complaint has its origin in many causes, and 
the cause should be discovered before treatment. If, 
however, this proceeds from temper, a pitcher of cold 
water dashed in the face with no sympathy exp'ressed, 
brings the patient rapidly to his senses. If this trouble 
arise from other causes or functional derangements, it 
is best to procure a physician. 'Wihen hysterics are pro-

ckiced by giving way to iimmo'derate grief, let the patient 
Jiave change of scene, cheerful c»m!pany, kind treat- 
ment, and nothing to excite the nerves he indulged in. 

Inflammation of the Brain. 

In this disease the hot foot bath and moving of the 
bowels should be the first thing to be done; room dark, 
kept quiet ^and well-aired. The head of the patient 
should be kept cool with very cold water, in which 
tincture of arnica, aconite or belladonna has been 
introduced, say a tablespoonful of either in a pint of 
water, taking care to remove the cloths frequently be- 
fore they become warm. Keep lower extremities warm 
by such means as indicated in the ai^ticle on "Drown- 
ing." Patient sliould be allowed to drink "Fever 
Drink" medicine internally. 'Give alternately every 
two hours a teaspoonfnl of tine, aconite, ten drops in 
a goblet of water; tine, belladonna, ten drops in a 
goblet of water. 

Whooping Cough. 

An excellent remedy for whooping cough I found in 
a preparation of linseed oil and common black molasses, 
equal parts, well mixed, and a teaspoonful taken at 
every coughing spell. ^Tis disagreeable to take at first, 
but children soon learn to take it. 

For Cold. 

A flaxseed lemonade is excellent for a cold. Trv 
a s)mall quantity at first. To do this take a pint of

water and add' two tablespoonfuls of the seed, the juico 
of two lemons, not using the rindi, and sweeten to taste. 
When too pasty the mixture may be diluted with water. 
Always ice for drinking. 

Milk to Fatten. 

Dxink four quarts of milk each day and you will 
soon gain the desiredi flesh, and have a round, pretty 
neck, plumpy arms, large bust and full face. 

Delicate Stomach. 

Boil a pint of sweet mdlk, sea&on with cinnamon and 
siweeten to taste; cinnamon from the apothecary, broken 
into hits, is better as a rule than the ground cinnamon 
from the grocery. Hot or cold, this is a good thing 
for a delicate or empty stomach. 

Cough. 

Take one quart of water, make it thick as gruel" with 
wheat bran, boil twenty-five minutes, then .strain 
iihrough a clotli. The liquid will be as thin as for 
gruel. Add a little nutmeg and sugar to siuit taste. 
Take it often, one or two swaJlows. Drink ^a pint 
each day, andl soon the cough will leave entirely. Give 
this a fair trial, say for one month, daily. 

Toothache. 

For ordinary toothache, which is caused by the ner- 
vous system' being out of order or by excessive fatigue, 
a hot bath will so soothe the nerves that sleeip will

naturally follow, and, upon getting up, the patient will 
feel very imncTii refreshed and the toothache will he 
gone. FoT what is know^n as the "jumping^' toothache, 
hot, diry flannel applied to the face and neck is very 
effective. 

Capsicum in Delirium Tremens. 

Dr. Lyons urges the use of eapsicum in from twenty 
to thir'ty grain doses in the invasive stages of delirium 
tremens. He aidiministers it in bolus or capsules. A 
simple dose sometimes produces profoundl and refresh- 
ing sleep, and thus cuts short the disease. Several 
cases are narrated showing the benefieial efficacy of the 
drug when thus used. As capsicuim belongs to the 
great order of the Solanaceae, Dr. Lyons suggests the 
possibility dt its eontaining a narcotic principle hitherto 
undiscovered. 

A Cure for Tetter. 

David Temiple, Sparta, 111., sends the following, 
which he pTonounces as an infallable recipe for the cure 
of tetter: Take the milky liquid which flows freely 
from the leaf or stalk of "milkweed''^ when broken, 
saturate the affected parts with it once 'or twice a day, 
and the tetter will disappear. 

Worth Knowing. 

To neutralize any poison, mineral or vegetable, taken 
intentionally or by accident, siwallow two gills of sweet 
oil. 



Home Benicdics. 339 

A Lotion for Weak Eyes. 

Twenty drops of kudianum and five droips of brandy 
in a wineglass of water. Apply three times a day as 
warm as the eyes will bear it. 

How to Stop Bleeding. 

Some persons have a tendency to bleed', no miatter 
T:ow slight the cause. A small cut, scratch or the ex- 
traiction of a tooth will cause profuse bleeding and 
sometimes emlanger life. When from the latter cause 
taJve a little powdered chalk, roll it up in lint in the 
form of a cork or plug, dip in spirits of turpentine 
and press it into the cavity. Change it every ten or 
fifteen minutes until the bleeding is stopped. Let the 
last plug remain over night, and then do not pull it 
out, but wash the mouth in tepid water after the first 
few mouthfuls. 

Bleeding from the nose is seldom serious except in old 
persons. It is often good for children, if not too co- 
pious. If symiptomis of faintness ensue, let the person 
sit upriglit, bathe the face and neck witb cold wat 
or dash cold water en the face, or, better still, take a 
cloth or towel, fold, .dip in cold water and bandage the 
forehead, and raise the arms as high as possible over 
the head or cross them firmly behind the back. This 
action has the effect of contracting the muscles of the 
neck and diminishing the rusli of the blood to the head. 
In very obstinate cases pinces of very finely powdered 
alum may be inhaled or alum water snuffed up the nos-

trils. Plussfinof the nostrils should not be resorted to 
unless by a physician, for, it not properly done, the 
blood, instead of being stopped, finds its ^^"ay to the 
top of fhe throat and is swallowed. 

Simple Cure for Cold Feet. 

The following remedy for cold feet is recommended 
by the Fireman's Journal for sedentary sufferers, as 
well as p'olicemen, car drivers, and others who are ex- 
posed to the cold: All that is necessary is to stand 
erect and very gradually to lift one s self upon the tips 
of the toes, so as to put all the tendons of the foot at 
full strain. This is not to hop or jumi^i up and down, but 
siimply to rise — the slower the better^ — upoD tiptoe, and 
to remain standing on the point of the toes as long 
as possible, then gradually coming to the natural posi- 
tion. Repeat this several times, and by the amiount 
of work the tips O'f the toes are made to do in sustain- 
ing the body's weight, a sufficient and lively circulation 
is set up. A heavy pair of woolen stockings drawn 
over thin cotton ones is also a recommendation for 
keeping the feet warm, and at the same time prevent- 
ing their becoming tender and sore. 

For Sensitive Teeth. 

Dissolve three lime tablets in a gla&s of wa.ter. 
Take a mouthful, working it about between the teeth, 
retaining as long as conveniemt. Do this about three 
times a day and the sensitiveness will disappear. 



Home Bemedies. 341 

Country druggists, as a rule, dK) not keep the tablet? 
but any city druggist can supply you. 

Bheumaiism. 

The following is a French remedy for neuralgia and 
rheumatism : Take ten grains of salicylic acid three 
times a day for three days, and if very severe take the 
same amount four or five times a day; take in a little 
cold water. This is ^a simple remedy, and it is hoped 
that all who are troubled with these painful diseases 
will give it a trial. 

Disinfectant. 

For a room w^here disease has created an unpleas- 
ant odor burn green coffee; have a smiall pan half filled 
with good solid coaJs, brown upon them a handful of 
coffee, p'ass the vessel under the bed and around the 
room. 

For Sour Stomach. 

A iperson who iwas in the habit of taking a tea- 
spoonful of pulverized pine charcoal for sour stomach, 
thought it an excellent remedy. It was mixed- with 
sweet milk. 

Cure for Snoring. 

I cannot believe with your correspondent "V/^ that 
the happiness of nations may be affected by tlie dis- 
cover}^ of a remedy for snoring, but I do know that a 
remedy, and a very simple one, is within the reach of 



342 The Model Housekeeper. 

all. The late Dr. O'Dowd, of Kilkenny, discovered a 
most effectual one, viz. : Olive oil and mustard' — ^six 
drops of the former to one of the later — taken just be- 
fore getting into bedi, the function of the oil being that 
of a lubricant, and so acting on the larynx, while the 
.mustard acted, and that imperceptibly, as a sort of 
counter irritant. So universally was the remedy ad- 
opted, and so effectual did it improve, that T don't 
believe that there is a snore left in Kilkenny. 

Faintness. 

It is usually caused by insufficiency or lack of poor 
air, confinement in a close atmosphere, foul odors, too 
much eating, or lack of food, or too little rest. Never 
resort to imedicines for such an illness — removing the 
cause will cure and also prevent recurrence of the at- 
tacks. 

Bleeding. 

For hemmorrhage (bleeding) caused by any injury 
tightly bandage or tie about the wound, i. e., if the 
wrist is cut, tie very tig*htly a handkerchief, towel or 
anything that will bind, laround the arm near the el- 
bow. If nothing is available for binding ipurposies, 
fm'ake .deep pressure with the fingers at the place you de- 
siine t^ bandage. If this does not stop the bleeding, 
mop iff the Meeding spot iwith an icy cold (or hot as 
can be borne) iwater. Never use lukewarm or tepid 
water, as it always increases bleeding.

A Simple Cholera Cure. 

"It is a sin/' said tlie late Rev. Dt. William Tracy, 
who spent the whole of his ad*ult life as missionary in 
India, and who had experience of m-any hundreds of 
eases of cholera," for anyone to die of cholera. If at 
the first premonitoi-y symptoms he lies down, at once 
and submits to a treatment the principal part of which 
consists of a patient and persistent nihbing of the ab- 
domen, to be kept up even after apparent collapse has 
occurred, he is certain to recover." 

Fisli Bone. 

To detach a fish bone from the throat, swallow a 
raw Qgg as quickly as it can be obtained. 

Constipation. 

A glass of cold water taken the last thing at night 
and the first thing in the momiAg will do better service 
than drugs. O'f the utmost importance in this m'atter is 
the habit of going to the closet at a regular and fixed 
time each day, say after breakfast, or at some other set 
liour. Select a time and always stick to it. An order in re- 
moving waste from the body must be observed as scru- 
pulously as that regularity which obtains in supplying 
the body with food and nutrition. 

Cold in the head and chest may be prevented by 
sponging or washing the neck and dhest and back with 
cold water every morning before dressing. The wet 
surface should be nibbed dry and until it is red. MoliheTs

will find children less apt to be, if ever, "croupy," if 
this bathing is followed out. 

Dyspepsia is oftentimes cured by thoroughly chew- 
in'gs one's food and eating slowly. Half a teacup of 
boiling water taken about five minutes before each 
meal is very helpful If a person eats mfuch meat and 
very little bread and vegetables a teaspoonful of vinegar 
or lemon juice at the close of the meal will relieve 
^march distress that frequently follows eating. For 
those w'ho eat less meat and more abundanly of other 
food's, a tablespoon fiul of limewater half an hour afte^* 
meals is very grateful. 

Frost Bite. 

There is no simpler or better remedy for frost bites 
thian the following: Efxtract the frost by the applica- 
tion of ice-water till the frozen piart is pliable, avoid- 
ing all artificial heat; then apply to it salve made of 
equail parts of hog's lard and gun powder, rubbed 
together until it forms a paste, and very soon th,o 
frozen parts will be well. 

Back Ache. 

Have you ever tried -a hot pancake for an aching 
side or back? 'Mix flour and water together until you 
have a thick batter, and cook on a hot griddle with 
vei^ little grease. Place it between thin muslin and 
apply to the aching place. A pancake applied to the 
base of the brain will often relieve a headache, and is 
recommended for congestion of the lun,gs.

A Cheap and Effective Disinfectant. 

The cheapest and miost effective disinfectant and de- 
odorizer for purif3'ing and destroying sewer gas, foul 
air, and the sulphide of hydrogen and ammanium gen- 
erated in sewers, sinks, cesspools, and on board 
passenger ships — the main cause of so many fatal fevers 
aud epidemics'^ — is a solution of chloride of lead. 

To prepare this solution on a small scale for use, 
take one-eightli of an ounce of nitrate of lead and dis- 
solve it in one quart of boiling water, and dissolve one 
ounce of pure common salt in about five gallons of 
water. 'Mix the two solutions, and when the sediment 
subsides, pour off the clear solution and keep in a de- 
mijohn for use. 

A cloth dipped in this solution and hung up in a 
sicik room, or a little of it dashed into a fo-ul siniv will 
instantly destroy all offensive odors, by uniting with 
and neutralizing them. 

Snake Bite, 

Bind above the wound tightly, give whisiky or wine- 
glass of sweet oil, bathe the part affected with oil, or 
beat an onion, as much tobacco cut up fine, the same 
quantity of salt, pour over this a half tumbler of boil- 
water, put it in ,a pot and stew two or three minutes, 
cord above the wound as soon as possible, apply the 
the poultice, repeat until danger is over; give a wine- 
glass si\\-eet oil. This is also a good remedy for the 
bite of a mad dog.

Cold Remedy. 

Bathing the feet in cold water immediately after 
getting them wet will prevent one from taking <3old. 

Another Cure for Burns, 

Oliarcoal has been discovered to he a cure for burns. 
By laying a piece of cold charcoal upon a burn the 
pain subsides immediately. By leaving the charcoal on 
one hour the wound is healed'. 

To Cure Toothache. 

The worst case of toothache may be cured, except it 
is connected with rheumatism, by taking alum, reduced 
to an impalpable powder, two drachtos; nitrous spirits 
of ether, several di'adhims. 'IVIiix and apply to tooth. 

To Cure Coughing. 

A celebrated physician of London says that cough- 
ing may be prevented by pressing on the nerves of the 
li'ps in the neighborhood of the nose, by pressing in the 
neighborhood! of the ear, and by pressing very hard 
on the top of the miouth. 

To Cure Hoarseness. 

When the voice is lost, as is sometimes the CKse, 
from the effects of a cold, a simple, pleasant remedy is 
furnished by beating up the white of one egg, adding 
to it the juice of one lemon, and sweetening with white 
sugar to taste. Take teaspoonful from time to time. 
It has been known to effectually cure the ailment.

The Cat a Carrier of Disease. 

Tn a recent medical editorial allusion is made to 
Kipling^s charming account of the first icat in one of 'hh 
"Just So'-' stories. "I am the cat that walks by him- 
self, and all places are alike to me," was the 
speech attributed to this ancient tabby. The housing 
of these pets is often a serious matter. "When you 
consider that diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough, 
measles, influenza and ringworm are said to be carried 
by tlie ''fireside sphinx," surely this ought to be a suffi- 
cient warning for great care in regard to the domestic 
cat. A most important point to remember is that these 
anim.als should be strictly prevented- from entering the 
sick-room.. 

Coughing. 

In severe paroxysms of coughing, a tablespoon of 
glycerine in a glass of ho-t milk will give almost in- 
stantaneous relief. ' . 

Corns and Felons.

(garlic and salt and apply warm; this will surely stop 
it.

after nine days the corn will come out, root and aJl.

•claims. 

Eczema. 

Biathe >the affected parts in strong, salty water, very 
hot; bathe several times during the day. I know of 
>two cases entirely relieved by this treatment. 

Side Room. 

The room should be kept thoroughly ventilated and 
a temperature not lower than sixty-eight degrees nor 
hig'her than seventy degi^ees. If the patient is kept 
warm, air may be freely admitted without the least 
danger. 

The nurse's dress should invariably be neat, tastefu] 
and pretty. Slippers or boots of felt should be worn. 
To' be continually smoothing the bed, pestering the 
patient with sympathy, and saying a dozen times an 
hour ^^How do you feel now?" is enough to drive a sick 
an an wild. 

The cross sheet should invariably be kept free from. 
crumihs and wrinMes, as these are a frequent cause 
of bed sores. AAHienever the least redness shows on the 
patient's body the skin must be at once bathed witli 
.alcohol, thoroughly dried and dusted with powdered 
•oxide of zinc. 

A sheet folded once lengthwise, laid across tlie bed, 



Home Remedies. 349 

with the upper edge just touching the pillcws and the 
(ends tightly tuoked under the mattresses, will be found 
to act greatly to the patient's comfort. It does not 
wrinikle like single sheet, and crumbs may be readily 
brushed off it. 

Meals for invalids should look as tempting as pos- 
sible. The tray should be covered with the whitest 
napkin, and the silver, glass and china sho'Uld shine 
with cleanliness. The ipatient should n>ot be disgusted 
hy a display of too much food, and should not be con- 
sulted beforehand as to what he will eat or drink. 

In bathing the invalid should never uncover too 
large a surface at once. Pin a blanket round the 
shoulders, fastening it behind, and remove the night- 
dress under that. Put the hand under the blanket and 
sponge the skin, a smaJl .portion at a time. A woman's 
hair sihou'ld be combed every day if she is able to bear 
the fatigue. If it has hecome tangled a little sweet 
i)il will loosen it. 

Household troubles should 'be kept far from the 
siok-room. Above ,all an invalid or an apparent con- 
valescent should be saved from his friends. One gar- 
rulous acquaintance may in haJf an hour undo the 
g'ood of a week O'f tender nursing. In long illnesses a 
small bed-table will be found indispensahle. Every 
cup, glass, spoon and utensil should be taken out of 
the room and washed as speedily as possible. As to 
walking on tip-toe and whispering, nothing can dis- 
tur*b a sick: person more.

Burns. 

Niotliing equals white of an e^g for burn. Apply 
at once and as soon as dry put on anotlier coat and 
keep this up until a thick coating is formed to en- 
tirely exclude the air when all pain ceases. This is 
never-failing and almost stops pain entirely, and 
usually if gotten on in time will prevent blistering. 
When for large, bad burn, beat the whites of several 
eggs, using one tablespoonful of salt to the whites ol 
two eggs; and after it is 'beaten up well, saturate cot- 
ton and apply to the burn. It will draw all the lire 
out, and then it is so coolinor fhat the sufferer can tro 
to sleep. 

For Warts. 

Dissolve as much common wasliin'g soda as the 
wateT will take up; wash the warts with this for a 
■minute or two, and let them diy without wiping. 
Another ^ay is to get a little bullock's gall and keep it 
in a bottle ; i^b a little on the warts two or three time? 
«a day,' and in a shiort time they will disappear. 

For Boils. 

The skin of a boiled Q^g is the most efficacious rem- 
edy that can be applied to a boil. Peel it carefully, 
■wet and apply it to the part affected. It will draw 
off the matter and relieve the soreness in a few hour?. 
Simple but efficacious.

Tender Feet. 

The best remedy in the world for tender feet is 
Epsom s'alts in hot water as can be borne. A basin of

three parts oif water which should make about one 
quart, when done, enough for one day^s use. Drink 
one teaeupful one hour before meals and at bed time. 
Make fresh every momin's:. Drink hot or cold.

^oo6 JFor o^e SlcL 

AJi^^rays ,prepare food for the sick in the neatest 
and most careful manner. In sidkness the senses arc 
unusually acuate, and far more susceptible to careless- 
ness, negligence, and mistakes in the preparation and 
•senring of food than when in health. 

Raw Eggs. 

Nothing is so atrengthening to a run doAvn con- 
(Stitution as raw eggs and should be taken as many 
as possible each day. Begin by taking two a day 
and increase the number gradually up to seven or 
eight. This can usually be digested by the most deli- 
cate stomach. Take with a little lemon juice and a 
sprinkle of salt, swallow a whole ^^g at one gulp. In a 
little while one can cultivate a taste for them. 

Gruel From Corn Meal. 

Mix smooth fwith cold water two and one-half table- 
spoonfuls of meal and a little salt to taste; stir this in 
■one quart of boiling water and cook twenty minutes, 
stirring all the time and should it Ibecome too thick 
thin with water, add a little butter and hlaok and red 
•pepper. This is fine to drink next morning after 
taking calomel. Drink real hot.

skin breaks and they prick tender with a fork they are 
do^ne. Sprinkle over sugar and serve cold. 

Beef Juice 

Is an invaluable form of nourishment. Secure a nice 
thick steak and hack well on iboth sides. Have a skil- 
let real hot and put the beef in and leave in just long 
enoiuigh to start juice which is only an instamt if the 
skillet is hbt enough, turn and take oip immediately 
and cut in pieces about two inches square. Ptit into 
a small meat or fruiit press and press until the meat 
beoomes colorless; pour this juice intO' a heated cup 
eitanding in hot water; add a dash of cayenne pep'per 
and salt. 

Beef Marrow 

Is one of the greatest delicacies and very nutrative and 
especially recommended to those predisposed to tubercu- 
losis. Order the marrowbone cracked in three lengths, 
wash off with cold water; cover each end with a paste 
of flour and water to hold in marrow; put in a clean 
cloth and tie seouxely eacb end and dtrop in fast boil- 
ing water; boil for a couple of hours or more, then re- 
move clotb and bake in oven for one hour. Remove 
marred, season with salt and pepper to taste and serve 
on hot toast on hot platter. The good results of this 
will more than repay for the troulbl'e. 

Mntton Broth. 
Muttion broth is one of the most valuable features

of inyalid diet. It is mitritious and sulbstantiary. 
BarJey or rice and parsley are usually coinlbined with 
it. 'Sweetbread's are also valuable food for delicate 
f^eople. Tripe is also easily digested when young and 
tender. The white meat of chicken and broth are 
strengthening and may be thickened by stirring in a 
iv;ell beaiten egg. 

Scraped Beef. 

One of the first forms of solid food perscribed in 
convalescing. Take one pound or less as required of 
the round of raw beeif and with a silveT-plated knife 
scrape off the surface meat diagonally until a desired 
quantity of soft, red pulp is obtained. This will bo 
found as tender al'most as marrow. iSpread upon dainty 
slices of whole Wheat bread. Season with salt and 
•pepper and make into dainty sandwiches. For a change 
these may be placed into a wire shield and toasted a 
delicate brown on both sides. Serv^e while hot and 
crisp. 

Panada. 

Split six Boston crackers and put in layers in a 
bowl, sprinkle each layer with salt and sugar. Cover 
with boiling water, cover the bowl closely and set in 
an open oven for at least an hour. The crackers should 
be clear and soft. For six crackers allow two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and a pinch of salt.

Eggs for Invalids. 

Invalids Sometimes find: it very hard to swallow 
the raw eggs prescribed toy physicdans. lif the following 
hints are oibserved it can be done with perfect oa^^- 
Put a few drops of vinegar in a cup, break the q^^ invo 
the cup, being careful not to break the yolk, salt and 
pepper to taste, put a few drops of vinegar on top of 
the Qgg, throw back the head and take the Qgg in the 
•mouth when it (will slip down the throat almost with- 
out any effort and iwith no taste at all except a very 
slight taste of the vinegar. I have seen this very suc- 
icessfully tried by an invalid who had found it impos- 
sible to take this most nourishing food for invalids until 
this plan was tried. 

Strengthening Jelly. 

Two quarts of water, three pound knuckle of veal, 
one-half pound lean beef, a little white pepper, salt, 
mace, and onion. Boil to half the quantity, then add 
the juice of half a lemon, and the whites of three 
eglgs. Put all into a saucepan, stir well, and let it boil ; 
then strain through a jelly-bag. It may be taken either 
hot or cold. 

Toast on both sides slice of stale bread from which 
all the crust has heen removed. Put in a bowl, sprinkle 
each slice with a little salt and sugar and pour in 
enough boiling water to cover all. 

Fit a lid on top of the bowl and set in an outer 
pan of iboiling 'water. Simmer igently until the bread 



Food For The Sid: 357 

is as tender as Jelly. Eat hot witli powdered sugar 
and a little nutmeg. 

Very savory beeif tea suitable for a convalescent may 
be made in the following manner. Take two ounces of 
butter, put it in a frying 'pan or spider over a clear 
fire; when it is melted throiw in two small onions 
i^hredded finely, stir them until they are a nice brown. 
Have ready one pound of lean beef cut into pieces the 
size of dice, put in the pan and let it brown also.! 
Turn the contents of the spider into a saucepan, add 
one quart of cold water and let it simmer until reduced 
to a pint. iStrain it before using. 

The pure juice may be extracted from beef in two 
ways. First, by cutting the meat in small pieces, put- 
ting them in a tightly corked bottle, immersing it in 
hot water and boiling for several hours. Second, by 
taking a thick piece of juicy steak, broilinig it on a 
gridiron over a clear fire for a few moments, then cut- 
ting it in strips and pressing it in a lemon-squeezer. 
The juice thus obtained may be given cold or hot. It 
may be frozen, broken into lumps and given like cracked 
ice. A little salt should be added before using it. 

An invalid who has tired of hot beef tea will some- 
times dfrink: it cold, or iced, with great relish. Enough 
isinglass or gelatine may be added to the juice to 
make a jelly, which can be flavored with essence, or 
celery, or anything the patient may fancy. 

Eaw meat is very nutritious, and may be prepared 
by shred'ding the beef extremely fine, removing every 
particle of skin and fat, and mixing it with cracker

,crumibs. A little salt and pepper may be added and 
the maxtnre rolled into tiny balls. 

On the subject o^ preparing drinks if or fever pa- 
tients, an exchange says : ^'^Drinks made from fresh or 
preser^'ed fruits are sometimes useful in fevers. Ehu- 
barb tea is a very refreshing spring beverage. Slice 
aiboiut two pounds of rhubarb, and boil for a quarter 
of an hour in a quart of water; strain the liquor into 
a jug, adding a small quantity of lemon peel and some 
sugar to taste; when cold it is fit for use. Apple 
water may be made in the manner. The apples should 
be peeled and cored. S.ugar should not be added to 
either of the above until after the liquor is removed 
from the fire. In the absence of fresh fruit, a pleas- 
ant beverage may be prepared by stirring sufficient 
raspberry jam or currant jelly into the required quan- 
tity of water, straining the liquor before giving it to the 
patient." 

To Prepare an Egg for cm Invalid. 

Beat the egg until very light, add seasoning to the 
taste; them steam until thoroughly warmed through, 
but not hardened ; this will take about two minutes. 
An egg prepared in this way will not distress very sen- 
sitive stomachs. 

Gruels. 

Flour and arrofw^root gruel is made in the s^me way 
but cooked onlv ten minutes.

The very 'first thing to he considered is cheerful- 
ness. iSome people will he cheerful under any livable 
conditions, others are correspondin@ly gloomy arid dis- 
jTial. Therefore as a matter of convenience always 
make the best of things. A smile and a bright word 
:\vill lead you to success, where dismal thoug-hits a/lways 
jniean failure in everyway. Never look u'pon your 
task as a hardship. It is more often the mental atti- 
ture than the physical one that tires us more than the 
real work. If a Ijihe and graceful figure is desired 
as age adK^ances one must keep up and even increase 
their activities and only eat enougih food as the body 
requires to keep usp the balance wiaste and repair. A 
few simple exercises gone through with each day will 
help much toward retaining one's activity and good fig- 
,ure. Live as much as possible in the open air and 
above all, keop regular hours in ever\-thinjg. House- 
hold work is really beneficial if you use the body natur- 
ally. When you must bend forward use the hip joint 
and not the back. Altways remember when sweeping 
to use the broom with your arms and hands, do not 
J^end forward and bend the back as a rounded back is 
very old looking. Be happy under any and aill con- 
ditions as it is possible for you to be. Have the house 
full cwf fresh air arid sunshine and it will certainly 
help very miuch toward makin.g you feel and lodk 
young.

any conditions miss your morning hath. If yon have 
no hath room taJ^e a good sponge hath and a good rulh- 
bin'g with a course toiwel until the skin glows. This 
.freely which is so necessary to heailth. A warm bath

Don'ts for Stout Women. 

The stout woman must not "slumnp." 'Her on© 
safeguard is an erect carriage — ^head up, chest up, a'h- 
domen in. This w^ards off the fleshy back. 

Nor miust she permit herself to relax. N"eig*ligees, 
.eom'foTt and down at the heel attire are not for her. 
She should keep trim though she nearly passes aiway 
with heat and diseomifort. 

She must watch her manners, particularly her table 
.manners. 'She may not take liberties with her elbows, 
lop over the table or eat carelessly. Daintiness is es- 
sential if she would not he rej^ulsdve. 

The stout woman must train herself to light walk- 
ing. Nothing shows her weight light dragging her 
feet along clumming heavily feet. 

She must learn to take life quietly. Etxcitement,

j-ushing and tem^per are conducive to a,pc^2^1exy and d^ 
not improve looks. 

.She must ,be dignified. It moves the onlooker to 
tears to see the stont wom'an full of airs and graces 
and kittenish co}Tiess. Her dignity shooiild not, how- 
ever, interefere with jollity. The hearty laugh is a hall 
mark of avoirdupois. 

Beyond all she must wear good corsets and learn 
■how to put them on. It make jiust the difference 'be- 
tween mountains of flesh and a thin stylish figure a 
trifle too large, but not repellant. 

Epsom Salts and Lemon Reducing Treatment. 

Dissolve one pound of Eipsoni salts in one quart of 
rainjwater. Shave fine tJhree bars of white so'ap and 
dissolve in one quart o'f boiling rain water. When par- 
tially cool, beat in the E^psam salt solution. Now add 
two more quarts of water and it is ready for use. At 
night rub the ^preparation on such rparts oif the body as 
yO'U wish to reduce, and let it dry in. 'When morning 
eomes, wash it off. Continue the use of the fat re- 
diucer until the desired resruilts are obtained. In ad- 
^itio-n to this wash, take the juice of half a le'mon 
in a !Ciitp of hot water, three quarter's of an hour before 
breakfast. The average redhiction in weight is two 
pounds every week. 

Keeping of Stoutness. 

The princiipal troulble is large appetites; always quit 
a little hunsrry and never eat 'between meals and omit

a meal occasionally. Instead of eating when liungry 
slowly drink a glass of water with, a sprinkle of salt in 
it and you'll soon get over the habit. Chew all food 
until about the consistency oif cream. If the food is 
thus masticated, hunger will be satisified by a much 
smaller amount. Cut O'Ut the best portion of sugar, 
starches and fats from the diet and take an hour of 
some form of pihysieal exercise each day, also indulge in 
;as many long walks as possible.

The Teeth. 

After eadh meal clean your teeth with a brush of 
which the bristles are longer at the end, thereby re- 
niowng particles of food from between the teeth. Use 
silk floss for the same purpose. Food causes decay, 
bringing {pain and exjoense. (Be icarefuO. th,at vjour 
toothpowder is not too gritty, as it will scratch the 
enamel, the safeguard of the teeth. Salt is a safe, 
•cheap and effectual dentifrice; so is powdered borax. 
A leaf or two of common sage rnbbed on the teeth 
night and morning cleanses and polishes the beau- 
tifully and wdll help to keep away tartar. An excel- 
lent powder is easily made in the folio-wing fasihion:

For a Dry, Itching Scalp. 

For a dry, itching scalp with falling hair, free from

Precipitated sulphur, one part; alcohol, one part; rose- 
water, five parts; distilled water, five parts. Once or 
twice a day dip the fingers into cold water and rub the 
scalp briskly. Do not wet the hair in this way.

tips anointed with a little olive oil or cold cream, little 
nips 'being given to the entire surface. The skin he- 
comes red and glowing. After the process a generous 
application of cold cream is left on the face for a time. 
Sueh a procedure stirs up the circulation, ibringing 
color to the cheeks. 

Rose Lip Cream, 

Crush a pound of damask rose-petals in a cup of 
i>weet cream. Strain through a piece of gauze and stir 
in a pinch o'f powdered vanilla. Eulb this dainty con- 
coction on the lips and they will become a beautiful red. 

Red lips call for pretty teeth. 'We must think of 
,some quick way of bleaching the yellow teeth. Here 
are two good ibleaches, either one of them within the 
reach of aJll. 

Either hold peroxide of hydrogen in the mouth for 
two minutes daily, or scrub the teeth off twice a week 
with a piece of lemon. Simple, isn't it? 

Do you admire glossy hair, little maid? If you do, 
3'ou wall be interested in hearing ahout a new way of 
polishing the hair. Dip a soft, clean rag in brilliant-

Gounardfs Oriental Cream. 

I am glad to be able to recommend a face lotion 
that is entriely harmless to the most sensitive com- 
plexion. I have used it exclusively for the past thirty 
years and have a complexion so sensitive that I cannot 
even use the simjplest powder. It not only gives one 
the appearance of a faultlless fairness but is both sooth- 
ing and healing and gives that velvety, softness to the 
touch so much desired. It will not rub off and defies 
detection and if its use is persisted in it will entirely 
remove tan, pimples, rash, black heads, and in fact, 
will give that delicate and refined complexion which is 
so much admired and envied by everyone. I am 
really an enthusiast on Oriental Cream and hope my 
patrons will give it a fair trial. 

Reddish Hair. 

Henna leaves made into a very strong tea will turn 
light hair a beautiful auburn. If hair is very oily 
first wash in gasoline by saturating a small cloth and 
juibbing through the hair a little space at a time. 
When thoroug'hly dry wash in henna tea. Eepeat after 
each drying until desired shade. This is perfectly 
harmless and is fine for hair beginning to turn gray.

wide as you can. Eepeat this several times during 
each day and several times at each exercise. 

Round Shoulders. 

Stand erect with hands flattened out on chest, 
fingers pointing toward each other, elbotws and should- 
ers high, with eyes raised toward ceiling. Slowly 
bend body forward at hips, keeping eyes fixed on point 
chosen. Do not let elbows sag. You will feel the pull

of the muscles down to your heels. If faithfully 
practiced eveiy day you will learn to stand erect with- 
out effort. Another good exercise is to first thing on 
arising in the morning stand erect with hands out- 
stretched on a level with shonld'ers and slowly raise 
yourselif on your toes and stretch arm's ^biaclkward as far 
as possible. Retain this position for a moment and 
then sink baok on entire foot. Do this twenty times 
a day at first and increase each day to a reasonable 
limit. These exercises will surely stnaighten should- 
ers if praeticed intelligently. 

Breatliing. 

Breathing exercises will greatly benefit anyone and 
very niudi improve the contour of figure and broaden 
ahest. Is fine for indigestion and pulmonary troubles. 
Here is a very simple one that can be carried out in 
your own room in front of raised window. It is es- 
pecially good for delicate and growing girls. Stand 
as erect as possiiMe with shoulders thrown back and 
chest forward, the arms hanging close to body, keep 
the head up and liips firmly closed and inhale very 
slowly through tihe nostrils, being very careful to fill 
the lungs completely witili air. AVhile inhaling tlie 
arms are to be gradually raised, the back of the hand's 
upward until they approacch each other above the head. 
The mo'vement should be so regulated that the arms 
should be extended directly over the head at the mo- 
ment the lungs are com|pletely filled with air. This 
position should be maintained from twenty to thirty

seconds .before the reverse process it begun, as the arms 
are gradually lowered the breath is exihaled sloiwly so 
that the lungs shall 'be as nearly as possible free from 
breath at the time the artms reach first position at 
side. These deep respirations should be repeated five 
or six times at each exercise and gone through with 
several times each day. Persist in this exercise and 
^ou will find from actual measurement that the chest 
h.as been broadened several inches and general health 
much impro'ved. 

Yawning for Health 

Is advocated by a noted German iprofessor of gym- 
nastics. He maintains tliat deep ya^^^ling practiced 
daily as a regular exercise is the cheapest and surest 
road to good health. The expansion of the breast bones 
and the stretohin'g of the arms which accompany a 
whde hearted yawn together with the filling of the 
lungs is the best daily exercise that can be practiced. 

Neck. 

To prevent lines from forming on the neck. The 
neck can be kept young and healthy looking it you 
will follow the three exercises. First. Point the chin 
over the left shoulder and iwhile keeping the eyes on 
the ceiling twist the neck around slowly and vigorously 
till the chin points over the right ^homlder then turn 
neck to starting place. Do this five times; repeat it 
six times a day at convenient intervals. Exercise No. 
2. Let the head fall back^vard wihile you stretch the 



376 The Model Housekeeper. 

chin up as higOi as you can, repeat several times a day. 
^xercise No. 3. Eoll the head completely around slow- 
ly ten times without stopping the motion. Repeat as 
often as you can d^uring each day. The circulation of 
the blood will he stimulated and the general health o 
the whole neck improived. These exercises will preivent 
the accumulation of fat, and make the neck round, elas- 
tic and strong. Breathing exercises also help. 

Abdomen. 

To' reduce abdomen stand with weight on balls of 
feet and cheat well forward, then raise artms in front 
of bod'y higOi above the head, turn palms upward, push 
and stretch up vigorously, feeling a strong pull on mus- 
cles of the abdomen. Five minutes at one time is long 
enough to continue this exercise. It however, must 
/be repeated several times during the day — ^ten times 
if possible. iSurplus fat on the abdomen can surely 
be gotten rid of in this way and the muscles so 
strengthened that there need be no fear of furthr ac- 
cumulation. 

Crow's Feet 

Do not naturally . come with age but are largely 
,made froin habit of needless motion and action of 
muscles of the face which with proper care and thought 
can be avoided. 

A Little Hint to Young Girls. 

Eat quantities of oranges, three times a day, if you 



Toilet. 377 

like, as they clarify the complexion. Eare beef is also 
good for the skin, while veal and pork are absolutey 
prohibited. Eat only stale bread or :thin toast, browned 
well on both sides. 

Bathing the face with buttermilk once or twice a 
day will reduce the tan and improve the complexion 
generally. Thiei should be applied liberally and allov^cd 
to dry on the face to get good results. And right here 
girls, let m.e tell you of a new wash-clotih that many of 
the smart woimen are using in New York. They 
are mad'e of white raw silk, and are said to be ex- 
tremely soothing to tender skins. You might try them, 
anyway. 

Then, too, the complexion brush will help if you 
have any enlarged pores. Instead of various makes of 
coarse soaps, use a soap powder which is very 
.soothing and healing to tanned skins'. 'Here is an ex- 
cellent pow^der which should (be keipt on the washstand 
in a jar with perforated top, so that it can be shaken out 
on a cloth or into the water without any great amount of 
waste. 

Bitter almond meal, six ounces, orris root (pow- 
dered), four ounces; wheat flour, four ounces; white 
castile soap, one ounce; powdered borax, one ounce; oil 
of burgamot, two drachms; extract of musk, one 
d'rachm; oil of bitter almonds, ten drops. 

Now, some girls do not like that powder, and pre- 
fer to use a lotion instead, so I will give one of the 
simplest and yet most helpful lotions I ever kneiw of, 
which any girl can make at home on the kitchen stove. 



378 The Model Housekeeper. 

You take two taiblespoonfuls of oatmeal — the kind you 
use for breakfast^ — ^adcl to it a quart of water and boil 
,for fif'teen minutes. lOool and strain this and to the 
liquid ad'd the juice of one large lemon and a dessert- 
spooniful of pure alcohol. Bathe the face in this^ and 
when you feel it is perfectly clean, pat it gently with a 
cloth until dry — then add more of the wash and allow 
this to dry naturally on the face. 

Lavender Scent Bag. 

Half a pound of lavender flowers free from stalk, 
half an ounce of dried thyme and mint, a quarter of an 
ounce of ground cloves and caraways, one ooince of 
dried comimon salt, miix them well together, and pu^. 
them into silk or camibric bags. 

Roseniiary is considered an excellent remedy to in- 
crease the growth of hair. iGet a small quantity of 
the leaves and boil them over a quick fire four minute?, 
strain, add a little cocoanut oil and a few drops of 
ver*bena. 

The Hands and Face in Hot Weather. 

A'fter a journey or long walk on a wanm day, it is 
most refreshing and beneficial to bathe the f a o and 
hands in very w^arm water, and from the face it w^ill re- 
move the unpleasant redness and heat in a very short 
time, and impart a cool and delightful sensation. The 
application of cool water to the face and hands when 
heated from fatigue or exercise is very injurious to the 
skin, prodiucing redness and eruptions that are seldom. 



Toilet. 379 

if ever remoTed. By the addition of a little spirits of 
wine or gin to the warm water, sunburns will be more 
likely prevented than by the simple application of hot 
water, but after a hoit walk: the face and (hands shomld 
be bathed for at least a quarter of an hour, the hot 
water added as the water gets cold. After great fatigue, 
if a bath is not at hand, to the foot bath may be added 
a few drops (sixty) of the tincture of arnica, and all 
fatigue will be speedily reanoved if the feet are allowed 
to rest in the bath about a quarter of an hour, and the 
hands and arms be also bathed in the same way. After 
rowing or driving, ladies will find these directions very 
useful. 

Cosmetic Gloves. 

(For night wear) : Yolk of two fresh eggs, two 
.tablespoonfuls ; oil of almonds, two tablesipoonfuls; 
tincture benzoin, one dessert spoonful; rosewater, one 
tablespoonful. Beat well together. Keep tightly 
;Corked. Paint the inside of the gloTCS every nig'ht, 
and do not wear the same pair longer than two weeks. 
Use kid or dog-skin glo^ves, if you cannot get India 
Rubber gloves, which are the best. 

For Thin People. 

If the body is thin, drink two quarts of creamy milk 
every day. until the desired amo'unt of flesh is gained. 
You should gain two pounds of flesh weekly on thic 
amount of milk unleess you have very laborious work. 
In case your body is plumip enough, ^he best way to 



380 The Model Houselceeper, 

pdiimpen dieeks would be to cover them witli a thin 
layer of skin food — after first bathing them for several 
minutes with hot water^ — at night before going to bed. 
To prevent cream from rubbing off in the night, it 
would be a good idea for you to wear a mask ,face. 
Taike a square of heavy wire cloth big enough to cover 
the face, and cut holes in it for eyes, nose and mouth. 
Fasten cloth strings to mask with small safety pins, 
lay mask over face and tie strings at back of head. 
Do this every night until your hollow cheeks are filled 
out. You will probably have to take this treatment 
for five or six months. It is slow work to plump cheeks 
by local applications. You also might practice filling 
mouth full of air, until cheeks round out like toy bal- 
loons, hold breath for ten co'unts, then slowly exhale 
through the mouth. Do this for five minutes, twice 
a day. 

Plumpening Cream for Hollow Cheeks. 

Tannin, one-half drachm; lanoline, tliirty draclims; 
oil oif sweet almonds, twenty drachms. Melt the lano- 
line and oil in a double boiler, stirring till thoroughly 
mingled. As the mixture cools, beat in the tannin. 

Cosmetic Paste for Hands. 

Oil of sweet almionds, two drachm's; glycerine, one 
drachm; rice flour, one drachm; fresh yolks, two 
drachms; roseiwater, one ounce; tincture of benzoin, 
thirty-sdx drops. 

Beat aill together until a paste is formed. Because 



Toilet 381 

of the eggs this will not keep veiy long, so you must 
jiot make up a large supply. 

Whem tlie hand's have been coated thickly with this 
beautifying mixture, draw on the kid gloves, first out- 
ting minute holes here and there in the kid. Tills is so 
•that the hand's may have air. 

If you wall carry out this treatment every night, I 
am almost willing to guarantee that you will have a 
pair of as White, dimpled hands as the most exacting 
girl co^uld desire. 

Do you wislh your ellbows to lose their u^ly lumps of 
calloused flesh? If so, you must bandage them at 
night as well as your hands. After they have been 
thoroiughly scrulbbed, rinsed in fresh water and dried, 
you must rub into them a liberal allowance of skin food. 
When this has been done, line a sanall pad of cotton 
with the skin food and place it over the elbow point. 
Now, to prevent pad from falling off, tie a wide strip of 
cotton cloth over all and run off to bed. This nightly 
treatment will soon banish those knobby elbow^s you are 
so ashamed of. 

Next, it is important that the neck should be white 
as driven snow. This is something the average neck 
is not, after the winter siege of fight collars. Spring 
generally finds us women with yellow and collar-marked 
throats. The only thing we can do is to ibleach our 
throats twice every day with benzoinated liquid, until 
the ugly scars and tints have disappeared. The lotion 
referred to is made very easily. 

'Simply put sixty drops of simple tincture of ben- 



382 The Model Housekeeper. 

zoin into a third' of a cup of tepid wated. Mop this on 
throat until every bit of the discolored skin has been 
moistened. Let lotion dry into the skin then massage 
gently for several moments with your favorite skin 
food. 

Dont expect immediate results because you will 
be disappointed. It is slow work whitening a discol- 
ored throat but perseverance wins. Not in a day or 
two, but in a week or two. 

Freckles and Sunburn. 

First, bruise and then squeeze the juice out of the 
common chickweed, and to this add three times its 
quantity of soft water; bathe the skin with this for 
five or ten minutes and wash afterward with clean 
water night and morning. iSecond, elder-flowers treated 
and applied exactly in the same manner. AVhen 
the flow^ers are not to be had the distilled water 
from them (w^hich may be procured fro many drug- 
gist) will answer the purpose. Third, honey, one 
ounce, mixed with one pint of lukewarm water; when 
cold it forms a good lotion. This is commonly called 
honey-wash. 

Mosquitoes, flies and gnats may be kept away by 
sponging the face and hands with elder flowers. 

To Whiten the Finger Nails. 

Take two drachms of dilute sulphuric acid, one 
drachm of tincture of myrrh, four ounces of spring 
water and then mix them in a bottle. After washing 



Toilet. 383 

the hands, dip the fingers in a little of the mixture, 
and it will give a delicate appearance to the hand. 
Rings with stones or pearls in them should always 
be removed from the lingers when the hands are washed 
as soap and water spoils jewelry set with precious 
stones. 

Eyebrows. 

Pretty eyebrows are necessary if a girl iwants to be 
considered good looking, so make a point of brushing 
and massaging your brows every day. With a small, 
soft bristled tooth-brush, smooth your brows until every 
hair lies just as flat as can be. This little brush will 
be found particularly useful when you have been so un- 
fortunate as to powder the brows as well as the face. 
Dusty eyebrows are the reverse of beautiful, so be sure 
and give them a thorough brushing, as soon as you 
finish powdering your face. 

Rubbing some simple tonic into the brows is ab- 
solutely necessary if your brows are scanty. When mas- 
saging in the hair-grower, be careful to ru!b with the 
fall of the hair. Unless you do this, you will have 
hideous, bush eyebrows, something no girl wants to 
have. 

Eyebrow Tonic. 

Sulphate of quinine, five grains; sweet almond oil, 
one ounce. 

Be very careful that not a drop of the liquid gets 
into the eye itself, as quite a serious inflammation wonld

Tesult. "The less liaste, tlie more speed" is true in 
this case. 

Perfumed hair is very popular just now and I don't 
wonder. You will be glad to know that this treatment 
can be easily carried out at home. All you need is a 
tiny vial of oil of geranium' or lavender, with which 
you moisten the bristles of your hair brush. Then pass 
the brush lightly over your pretty tresses, until you feel 
that every single hair has had its share of the sweet per- 
fume. 

For People Who Wish to he Stout. 

The rule will he oibserved hy those persons who feel 
that they ought to be a trifle stouter, is simply this, says 
a very practical physician: Avoid excitement and 
keep your mind as much as possible in a state of repose 
and free from w^orry. People of a nervous tempera- 
ment should control themselves. Learn to sit quietly 
for a long period, and don't rush about consuming 
muscular tissue by unnecessary movements. Eat all 
you can and as often as you can, avoiding hot things, 
such as hot bread, and that which is made from the 
finer grades of wheat. iStale bread made of flour con- 
taining a portion of the chaff, is far more nutritious 
than light, freshly-baked bread. The diet should con- 
sist of such articles of food as are largely composed 
of starch and sugar and oil. Meat in large quantities 
should be avoided. All things should be thoroughly 
cooked in order that the raw material can undergo the 
chemical dhange that otherwise would have to be done 



Toilet 385 

by the stomach. Lastly, sleep as long as yoiar time 
allows. These rules and sueh suggestions as you will 
observe by watching yourself, will soon add all the flesh 
to your frame that you want. 

Treatment of Toilet. 

Gray hair is not a blemish but a great heauty when 
properly cared for. And the proper care is, in every 
case, absolute cleanliness. 

A young face with white hair is always attractive 
and if your health be good you are to be envied. For 
shampooing, use only the whites of eggs and castile 
soap — 'it is so easy to streak gray hair. Make a soap 
jelly with the castile and hot water, and after it grows 
firm use one tablespoonful with the white of one egg. 
As a rule, two eggs are required for a satisfactory sham- 
poo. Beat both together with a little <warm water. 
Euib well into the scalp and through the hair, then 
rinse in many waters. In the final rinse water put a 
dash of indigo, not the bluing used in the laundry, hut 
the pure inddgo, which may he purchased at the drug- 
gist's. It is difficult to state quantity required; have 
a large basin of lukewarm water, into which slowly 
drop the indigo until the water is a very light blue. . If 
it be too light, there will be no result; too dark it 
stains the hair. A little experimenting will soon bring 
good results. See that your brush and comb are in a 
state of exquisite cleanliness ; nothing so quickly streaks 
white hair as carelessness in this respect. 



386 The Model Housekeeper. 

Simple Home-made Shampoo. 

Take the yolk of one egg, one pint of lukewarm 
rain-water and one ounce of rosemary spirits. Beat the 
mixture up thoroughly and use it warm, rubbing it 
well into the scalp. Then rinse and dry in the open 
air. During the week, massage the scalp every night, 
dipping the tips of the 'fingers into a few drops of 
olive oil. 

Now, tan is one thing and freckles are another, and 
are a much more difficult problem to fight. They 
will appear on some skins, do what you will, and the 
worst of it is that they always appear on a very fine, 
white skin, which without the freckles would be rarely 
beautiful. Freckles are really a deposit of pigment 
under the skin, and to really get rid of them they must 
be reached by some remedy which will destroy the outer 
skin. Perhaps the most popular and least harmful 
remedy is pure lemon juice, and if this is too harsh 
on the tender skin mix it with a little glycerine. 

Hair Pomade. 

White vaseline, three ounces; castor oil (cold 
drawn), one and one-half ounces; gallic acid, one and 
three quarters drachm ; oil of lavender, thirty drops. 

This ointment is so penetrating in character that it 
goes right to the hair roots, where it is needed. I do 
not advise staining hair, but would suggest giving the 
hair follicles a chance to recover strength. 



Toilet. 387 

Carmine Lip Paste. 

Carmine, seven and one-half grains; boric acid, one 
and one-half drachms; hard paraffin, one-half ounce; 
soft paraffin, one ounce. 

If you do not wish to use a rouge, you might try 
robbing a slice of lemon across the lips. This iwill 
leave them pleasantly red, provided they were not chap- 
ped. 

To Develop Bust. 

Massaging bust for twenty minutes daily with warm 
cocoa butter will promote bust development. Before 
commencing the massage, bathe bust with hot water 
until flesh is scarlet-tinted. After massage dash quan- 
tities of cold water over chest and hosom. 

The Best Complexion Aid. 
English girls, more than American girls, seem to 
realize the magic touch of outdoor sports. Nothing 
makes a girl more attractive than a perfect, wholesome 
body. Massage will not do for you what hill-climbing 
will. Seek after the ideal of perfect health— but seek 
with a steady purpose of attaining it. Such possession 
is .within the reach of most of us. 

Spotted Veils Bad for the Eyes. 

Spotted vedls ought to banished if you wish to pre- 
serve your eyesight. 

For a Shiny Nose. 
Substitute almond meal for soap in washing your 
face, then powder your nose gently with starch. 



388 The Model Housekeeper. 

For Chilblains. 

One girl overcame this trouble by bandaging ber 
feet loosely with cloths saturated in crude petroleum. 

What to do for a Red Nose. 

Eub your nose upward from the tip to the bridge, 
emptying the engorged veins. 

Discouragement Affects Decision. 

When discouraged never decide an important ques- 
tion. Wait until you feel like a conqueror^ then use 
the clearest judgment you possess. 

Cucumber Juice for Massage Cream. 

'Clicumber juice for massage cream you can obtain 
at home by chopping the whole cucumbers very fine, 
then straining through cheesecloth. 

Face Bleach. 

You can bleach your face to a satin whiteness by 
using this. Make a thin paste of almond meal and 
melted cold cream. You might add a few drops of 
water also. Spread this on the face and lay over it 
hot moist towels. Get your mother to change these 
towels for you as your face must be kept covered with 
them for fifteen minutes. Then do this only a week. 
In about six treatments you will obtain the desired 
v/hiteness of skin.

"yarm, (bavbdti anb "poultry* 

Practical farming requires the best tHouglit, the 
soundest judgment, and the most direct use of "com- 
mon sense," if the work done is to count. 

To the person who has never had any experience 
with sheep we woukl advise a start with a [flock of 
from ten to fifteen strong, healthy ewes and one ram. 
It is well to start with a small flock and let your flock 
and experience grow together. 

Hogs. 

. Colonel F. D. Curtis says in the New York Weekly 
Tribune that a hog is one of the best aids a farmer 
can have to help turn his farm to a good account. He 
advises turning the porker into the fields, where he will 
consume a great deal of course material, not excepting 
weeds or even thistles, and turn them all into money. 
He will also make the land rich faster than any other 
animal, if allowed to do so. Put the hogs in the field 
and feed them there. No farm is complete in its ar- 
rangements unless provision is thus made for the hogs. 

Cabbage Worms. 

A farmer's wife, writing to the Country 'Gentleman, 
tells how she keeps cabbage worms away from the plants. 
She always has nice cabbages. iShe keeps an old tin 
pan full of dry fine earth, and every time she goes 
into the garden she sifts a spoonful or more of the dust 

389 



390 The Model Hlomekeeper. 

over the cabbages, and the worms neyer molest them. 
Also, by putting plenty of sawdust around current 
bushes she saves them from the iworms, and it makes 
them bear larger fruit, as it keeps the ground moist 
and rich. 

Fertilizer. 

An exchange says that rocky forest land had better 
be kept in woods until the rest of the farm is in the 
highest possible state of cultivation. There are mil- 
lions of acres of poor land partly cultivated that ought 
never to have been cleared off. Of that which is plowed 
not one acre in 1,000 is made to produce half as much 
as it would produce if thoroughly tilled and wisely 
fertilized. 

So long a^ a stone is not too large to be turned 
in the farrow, or pass between the harrow teeth, it is 
a benefit to the soil. It is merely a solid fragment 
which gradually weathers away and is constanly fur- 
nishing fertility as the rain and frost crumble it down. 
Hence to pick a field clear of these "incumbrances" is 
to deprive it of a source of constantly accruing plant- 
food — ^potash, lime, phosphoric acid and other valuable 
mineral matter. 

Potatoes. 

The potatoes from whole seed ripened nine days 
earlier than those from cut potatoes at the Ohio ex- 
perimental station. 



Farm Garden and Poultry. 391 

Coivs. 

A good cow should not 'be fat, even when not giving 
milk. Her sides should appear fat, but rather by the 
deepness of her Ibod'y than by its narrowness. Her hea:l 
should be small, neck thin and flat and chest deep. In 
a very young heifer it is impossible to decide what her 
bag and teats will be, but an animal that shows these 
points is worth saving and trying as a cow. One that 
has a sound hody and a coarse, bull-shaped head, will be 
worth more for beef than for milk. 

Sheep. 

From the statistics furnished from the office of the 
Secretary of the State Board, it is nearly demonstrated 
that the yield of wheat is gauged by ^he number of 
sheep kept on the farm. 

Thistles. 

Canada thistles, plowed under in the hlow in a dry 
time, are good manure, apparently sent from heaven for 
a valuable purpose. Allowed to get ripe, we readily 
imagine they come from the other place. 

Colts. 

Youn,g colts can be easily broke if the right method 
is pursued. The one we prefer is the following: When 
the proper period arrives to do so, place the saddle 
on its back and let it stand for a day or two at a time. 
The bridle, etc., should follow the same course; then 



392 The Model Housekeeper. 

harness into the wagon and let stand for a day or so; 
also, do the same out of doors. Food and drink shouh[ 
be given at the proper times in the stall; then try 
leading it with the harness on; then with the carriage 
attached, and finally try to drive it. Use it carefully 
and patience will succeed. 

Dairymen. 

A Connecticut dair3Tiian, who has been experiment- 
ing with turnips as food for cows, thinks they are worth 
twenty-five cents a bushel. There is no saving in the 
amount of hay consumed, but they increased the flow 
of milk, and were an aid to the digestion of hay and 
other dry fodder. European experimenters have come 
to the same conclusion. 

Feed for Bogs. 

In summer swine graze and do well on clover, and, 
indeed, are perhaps as healthy and make as cheap and 
satisfactory growth on that food as on any other. There 
is no reason why clover should not enter into the winter 
rations of swine. Sweet clover hay could be cut up 
into short lengths and fed wet, along with meal and 
bran, without much trouble and with the best of re- 
sults. 

Cows. 

If your cows seem indisposed, give them a warm 
bran slop well seasoned with ginger. 

Malce Hens Lay. 
Hens will lay much better if given a variety of feed

ill winter. A feed of wheat, buckwheat, rolled oats 
and barley, raw turnips cut in halves, cabbage and kale. 
This is just as cheap as all grain. Save all the scraps 
from table and make a pudding about three times a 
week of left-over gravies, soups, potatoe and turnip 
peelings, outside leaves of cabbage, all sicra.ps from 
table, meal, bran, a little wheat bran, in fact, anything 
will answer for this pudding. Add a little soda and 
make strong with red pepper; cook low and feed warm. 
Give parched corn with a little grease of any kind 
stirred in while hot and sprinkled generously with red 
pepper two or three times a week. Buttermilk and 
cabbage is also good to give occasionally. . 

Healthy Chickens. 

To keep poultry healthy mix a tablespoonful of 
sulphur with feed twice a week and a few drops of 
carbolic acid in their dTinking water for a few days at 
a time then wait a few days and begin again. 

Setting Hens. 

xA.lways before setting your hen clean out nests 
thoroughly and whitewash with a solution of lime, 
crude carbolic acid, salt and sulphur. Then put in 
fresh nests. It is always best to set hens out of doors 
(in barrel. The top end on the ground with a door 
cut in side and the bottom of barrel keeps off rain. 
This keeps vermin from hen house and the chicks are 
much healthier hatched in this way. 



394 The Model Housekeeper. 

Sheep Dip. 

If you find you 'have chiggers and lice among your 
(flock the only sure remedy is to dip them thoroughly 
in sheep dip, about one pint to five or six gallons of wa- 
ter in lard cau of water which is a very convenient vessel 
to dip them in^rub it in next to skin and see the skin and 
under feathers are saturated. Dip a warm, clear day 
and don^t miss a single one. Wash off roosts with same 
mixture. 

How to Make House Plants Grow. 

To make house plants grow saturate the earth 
around them every day with the coffee left over at 
breakfast. 

Five or six drops of .ammonia to every pint of water 
once a week will make them flourish. ' 

To make bulbous flowers blossom fill a flowerpot 
half full of quicklime and the remainder with good 
earth, plant bulJbs and keep the earth damp. The heat 
of the lime, tempered by passing through the earth, 
will cause the bulb to send forth shoots to blossom. 

The colors of red and violet flowers are rendered 
extremely brilliant by covering the earth in the pots 
with about one-half inch of pulverized charcoal. 

Charcoal does not affect yellow flowers at all in this 
way. 

Saving a Chilled Fig. 

O'f all the means of suocessfully warming a chilled 
pig and restoring his interest in things earthly, pro-

balbly there is nothing better than a pail or other vessel 
of water heated to about 95 to 98 degrees Fhr. in which 
his body and limbs can be submerged for ten orf twenty 
minutes. In many instances it will well-nigh revive 
the dead. If after this hot bath Mr. Pig is dried and 
placed where he can suck a well-filled teat, his out- 
look on the future will be mueh improved. 

Setting Hens. 

Put a handful of powdered sulphur in the nest of 
the setting hen, scattering it all over the straw and 
eg-^s. Also dust it among the feathers of every por- 
tion of the hen's hody^night is the best time to do it — 
and you will find that the parasites cannot live. Then 
the nest heing free, the young chicks will not he at- 
tacked. ^ . 
Constipation in StocJc. 

If horses or cattle are troubled with constipation, 
give such animals half a peck of potatoes each day for 
a week or two. Two quarts of wheat hran, mixed with 
a horse's oats night and morning, has a tendency to 
prevent and relieve costiveness. 'Bran fed moderately 
and regularly to coiws, ewes and hrood sows will keep 
the bowels in proper condition. 

Oats for Poultry. 

It is stated hy an intelligent and successful dealer, 
that experiments have satisfied him that chickens from 
hens fed on oats are much more vigorous and hardy than 
from those fed on com.

Best Harness Polish in the World. 

Alcohol, one gallon; white turpentine, one and a 
half pounds; gum shellac, one and a half pound's; Ve- 
nice turpentine, one gill. Mix and let them stand by 
the stove till the gums are all dissolved; then add sweet 
oil, one gill, and color, if 3-ou wish, with lamp-hlack, 
two ounces. It will not crack. 

Feeding Pigs. 

Some farmers think that it does not make any dif- 
ference where pigs eat. This is a mistaken idea. A 
platform can be made near the feed house, the size of 
the platform depending upon the number of pigs. My 
plan is this : The floor is enclosed by a three-board 
fence. A gate on hinges made, by which to reach plat- 
form from corn-crib and feed-barrel. 'Six troughs are 
arranged in twos on the platform, two at each side and 
two in the middle, so as to allow passing between with- 
out soiling clothes and to give sufficient room for the 
pigs. This number of troughs will accommodiate be- 
tween fifty and one hundred pigs. Another large gate 
is made opposite the small one. This one slides up 
and down. It is raised after the slop is placed in the 
troughs. The pigs then rush in and eat, after which 
they are immediately driven out, so that the plaform is 
kept as clean as possible. It must be cleaned occasion- 
ally. Give pigs large fields to run in, and grra dually 
increase the amount of protein food, thus making blood, 
bone and muscle so that they can take on fat.

Recipe for Tanning Hides, 

Take equal parts of alum, salt, and saltpeter, pul- 
verizing together, and rub it thoroughly on the fiesh 
side of the pelt; and then roll it up and let it remain 
from three to five days; then unroll and work it with 
the hands until dry and pliable, scraping off all fiesh 
that may have adh.ered to the hide in the process of 
sJkinning, and the hide is then ready for use. 

Soil for Box Planting. 

Always put a barrel or box of rich dirt in cellar be- 
fore frost comes so you may have it to use in planting 
your vegetaibles and flowers in boxes in the house. Fo^ 
in spring the soil is so wet it is impossible to get i*. 
in time for early plants. They should be planted in 
boxes about middle of February. 

For Lovers of Flowers. 

InS'tead of going into detail on annuals plants, 
bulbs, flower and garden seeds which would take up too 
moich space I shall adcipt what I think to be the better 
plan and most reliable authority on the subjects. 
Peter Henderson of Coutland Street, Few York, has 
the leadinsr house of its kind and has been in business 
longer than any other florist on the continent. He 
p-ets out the lars^est and handsomest cataloojue with di- 

CO o 

rections so plain and simple for the culture of each 
plant that a child could succeed. I must say that his 
seeds, both for vegetables and flowers, are of the very 



398 The Model Hotiseheeper. 

finest variety and can be relied upon in every instance 
to come true to name. He introduced the wonderful 
Pondoroso tomato which is by far the most desirable to- 
mato in cultivation. I have exhibited it a number of 
times and never failed in any instance to carry off the 
blue ribbon. His roses, sweet peas, and asters are also 
equally fine. In fact, everything he advertises can be 
relied upon as the very best and one would do well 
to buy exclusively from the large catalogue which he 
IS always glad to send on application. 

4-11-44. 

This preparation sold by druggists under a posi- 
tive guarantee after using one-half bottle to refund 
money if it fails to cure the following diseases : Roup, 
limberneck, gapes, cholera, canker, diarrho'ca, etc. I 
have used it myself in many cases and never lost a 
fowl after giving the first dose; although in many cases 
I have had hens too far gone to stand up and always 
after a few doses they were cured sound and well, never 
requiring any more than twelve hours to cure the most 
aggravating cases. It also is never-failing with young 
chickens, often I have cured them with one dose when 
they were too weak to follow their mother and in an 
hour's time were eating and seemingly feeling as well 
as ever with never a return of the disease. I also 
know of many others who have used it equally success- 
ful. I recall two instances of friends who had large 
droves of very fine turkeys and were losing ten or* 
twelve daily one with roup the other with limberneck

get all the sunshine possible.

lets. They seldom lay very mucli before they are one 
year old and when you dispose of them the next year 
which keeps one raising all tlie time and doing with- 
out one year's profit while raising them. Hens often 
make fine layers at four years old. I have really an 
exceptional case in a hen nine years that even now lays 
more eggs than any pullet I have. (She has always 
ibeen first to set and has never failed to raise four 
flocks, of chicks every summer and continues to la\ 
through tlie winter when the other hens are idle. 

Burying Chicks. 

Look immediately to having your fowls buried very 
deep in a safe place from the other poultry for they 
will scratch them up and pick on them as long as 
they can find a scrap. This almost invariably causes 
gapes in little chicks and breeds other diseases in the 
older ones. 

A ball of waste cotton saturated with coal oil rolled 
in sulphur and fired under a tree did not burn rapidly 
but sent up a dense smoke which killed all the bark 
lice with which the tree was infested, so says a Pennsyl- 
vania fruit-grower. 

Liquid for Watering Vines, etc. 

One part by weight of cow manure with four parts 
of tepid water makes an excellent liquid for watering 
vines, strong plants^ fruit trees and strong growing 
vegetables as tomatoes, cucumbers, celery, cabbage. A 



FcM-m Garden and Poultry. 401 

pint of this mixture should weigh a little more than one 
pound. 

Tomatoes. 

Don't pour manure water around tomato plants, 
''every day'' to make them fruit early, for the reasou 
that the originator thought hecause a little was good 
a great deal was hetter. Early fruiting is only pro- 
duced, as a rule, by restricted gi'owth. After tomato 
plants have Ibegun to blossom forcing should be sus- 
pended. 

Oucumtbers intended for picking purposes need not 
be planted tiH July. The land for them should be such 
as has been well cultivated the year previous, and the 
manure should be fine and well^rotted. In order to 
guard against the attacks of hirds and insects an ex- 
cess of seed should be used, thinning out the extra 
plants after they are up. 

Hen Hotise. 

^ Give the poultry houses a heavy coat ol whitewash, 
mixed with some crude carbolic acid. This is one of 
the best treatments for lice and mites. 

Raspberries. 

A hill of raspherry plants, after being trimmed in 
the spring, should have only three or four canes, about 
three and one-half feet high and nearly one inch m 
diameter at the base, each cane having a few side spurs 
about ten inches long. 



402 The Model Housekeeper. 

Honey. 

Honey should' 'be kept in the dark, or it will granu- 
late. The bees, knowing this, work in dark hives. If 
light could enter the honey would become solid and the 
bees would starve. 

Asparagus. 

Plan to plant crops that live from year to year, like 
asparagus, rhubarb, straiwberries, and the like, at one 
end of the garden, so that they will not interfere wihen 
you cultivate the annual vegetables. 

Horse Indigestion. 

To cure indigestion in a horse : iGive, morning .and 
evening, during every other week, the following dose 
mixed among slightly damped oates. One drachm each 
of powdered sulphate of iron and ginger, and two 
drachms of powdered gentian. 'Keep a lump of rock 
salt and some powdered prepared chalk constantly with- 
in reach of the horse. Wlien weather permits, give 
the horse liberty outdoors during the day. 

To Remove Warts on Horse. 

A strong, waxed thread, of the kind which shoe- 
makers or saddlers use, miay be tied very tight around 
the wart, at its base, close to the skin, without pulling 
on the wart. If, in the course of a week the wart 
does not drop off, another thread may be similarly ap- 
plied, between the one first applied and the skin. Wlien 



Farm Garden and Poultry. 403 

the tumor has dropped off apply once daily a small 
portion of tincture of iron; generally no other treat- 
ment is required. 

The Poultry Yard Says 

To utilize the feathers of ducks, chickens and turkeys, 
generally throwTi aside as refuse, trim the plume from 
the stump, enclose them in a tight bag, rub the whole 
as if washing clothes, and you will secure a perfectly 
uniform and light down, excellent for quilting cover- 
lets and not a few other purposes. 

Facts Worth Knowing. 

Make and turn over the compost heaps. 

Test seed corn by sprouting. This will be greatly 
wanted this season. 

Colts, pigs and calves, not being required for use, 
either for work or the butcher, should be fed but little 
corn, as fat in excess is not necessary with them. 

Melons. 

Wlien a muskmelon or cantaloupe is ripe, the skin 
around the stem begins to crack and fall away. This is 
invariably the case. A ripe muskmelon should easily 
pull loose from the stem, leaving it on the vine. If the 
melon is plucked before the stem will break off easily, 
it should be laid aiway to ripen in the shade. 

Windows in Bam. 

Mr, Trump who favors a more liberal use of wind- 



404 The Model Housekeeper. 

ows in barns and stables, says experiments have proven 
that co'Wis give more and better milk when changed 
from dark stables to light ; less food is also required. 

Trees. 

If you are young plant trees; if you the about to 
exchange time for eternity, plant trees; they will be a 
more enduring monument to your memory than the 
<?cstly mar'ble. 

Feed for Poultry. 

In growing food for poultry it should be borne in 
mind that corn, wheat and oats can always be pur- 
chased, and it is the best, therefore, to grow sorghum, 
broomcorn, popcorn, millet and sunflowers for seed, 
which can not so readily be procured in the market. 

Crude Oil. 

'We have found crude oil one of the best and most 
effective louse killers and disinfectants. It makes an 
excellent dip for siwine. It will remove all of the old 
scales and scurf and improve the general appearance oi 
the herd. 

When mixed with crude carbolic acid at the rate of 
one gallon of crude carbolic acid to fifty gallons of crude 
oil it makes a cheap land effective disinfectant for use 
in the hog houses, hen houses, and water holes in the 
hog lot. 

It can be used with safety as a fly repellant on all 
farm animals by the use of sprayers, and will prove

as well adapted to that purpose as many of the more ex- 
pensive dips and mixtures. 

Staking Tomatoes. 

W%ere tomatoes have no market value and only a 
few are grown for home use, as on thousands of farms, 
perhaps it does not pay to train up from the ground. 

But if you are growing them for market it will 
pay to use stakes. 

Either set a stake for each plant or set a stake at each 
end of the row and run a wire along, tying the plants 
to the wire. Two wires will be needed. 

A single stake for each plant is hetter than the 
wire, and the plant should he large enough when trans- 
planted to need the stake at once. 

Where vines trail over the ground 25 per cent of 
the crop is lost hy rot. 

Warm Water for Cows, 

A little meal stirred into a pail of water gives it a 
relishahle flavor, and induces a cow to drink more, he- 
sides affording some additional nourishment. If the 
temperature of the water is first raised to seventy or 
eighty degrees, it is all the better, since the cow will 
drink more warm water than she will cold.

Adhesive Plaster. 

A spool of good! adhesive plaster is worth, its weight 
in gold in the home. The kind used by the surgeons is 
best and comes in different widths. It is fine for 
cuts and' bruises and for holding any kind of dressing 
01 poultice in place when they can not be tied on. It 
is fine for mending corsets holding protruding steels 
in place and repairing breaks. Will mend a 
splintered handle or chair leg — apply it to the under- 
sidie of a rug that curls or is torn and see how 
nicely it remedies the trouble. It makes excellent 
labels for fruit or jelly jars; write on smooth side and 
stick other sidle to jar and the finest thing in the world 
to fasten mail or express packages and lots of other 
things. 

Gilt Frames^ 

May be freshened by beating white of egg with a little 
soda. Apply with soft brush dipped in mixture. 

Ink Spots 

If soaked in sweet milk at once before drying, repeat 
several times, getting fresh milk as it is soiled will 
nearly always remove it. Another way for delicate 
fabric is to dip in melted tallow and repeat. If these 
simple means fail, then dissolve in hot water, a table-

If a shirt bosom or any other garment has heen yel- 
lowed by washing lay it where the hot rays of the sun 
will shine directly upon it. The heat will entirely re- 
move the mark. 

Trurik Paclcing.

To Clean Silver. 

Put in pan and cover with sour buttermilk, let stand 
for an hour, rinse in hot water and it will he bright

Nails. 

To prevent nails from splitting wood-work or rust- 
ing, first run them in a bar of laundry soap. Never 
use any kind of scouring soap to clean a bath tub. It 
will soon take off the enamel. Use kerosine; it cleans 
it beautifully. 

To Clean Furniture. 

Use weak tea, almost cold to remove dust or dis- 
colorations or if much soiled clean with coal oil; let 
stand on furniture over night. Then rub vigorously 
nexit morning with soft cloth, then use fol- 
lowing polish: Etqual parts linseed oil, turpentine and 
vinegar; shake well together in bottle. Apply with 
flannel cloth and rub hard, polishing with an old sock. 

Guilt Frames. 

To renew guilt frames : Take whites of two eggs, 
one ounce of soda; mix well and d^ust frames thor- 
oughly. Apply with a soft brush. To take off fly 
specks, moisten frames with white of egg, let it remain 
«bout fifteen minntes, then wipe off with piece of old 
.silk. Plaster busts and statuary are cleaned by dip- 
ping them into a thick raw liquid starch and drying 
and when starch is brushed off the dirt is brushed off 
with it.

How to Cheat Jack Frost. 

When a killing frost has struck tomatoes, grapes 
or other tender plants in the early fall, sprinkle with 
cold water early in the morning, 'before the sun's rays 
reach the plants, and there will he no damage. 

Relief for Felon. 

When you first feel the stinging or thumping sen- 
sation, procure a small piece of fly blister, place it 
directly over the spot, let it remain about eight hours 
and then remove it. You will see the felon, or matter, 
under the surface of the skin, and can remove it by 
pricking with the point of a needle. 

To Make Umbrellas Last. 

When standing a wet umbrella up, put the handle 
end down. The water will then run away from the 
wire which holds the ends of the ribs to the handle. 
When an umlbrella is turned the other way the water 
gathers at the ends of the ribs and rusts out both the 
ribs and the wire, and also rots the cover. 

To make steaks tender put three tablespoonfuls of 
salad oil and one of vinegar, well-mixed together, on 
a large flat dish, and on this lay the steak before it is

the child to open its mouth; apply your mouth over it 
and blow hard; the offending substance will be expelled 
from the nose. 

To Trap Ants. 

Put a slice or two of bread, with a little honey 
spread over it. The ants will draw to it quickly until 
it is black all over. Then pour boiling water over them 
and repeat the dose when required. 

The Hanging of Mirrors. 

Never hang a mirror wihere the sun's rays will strike 
upon it. They act on the mercury and cloud the glass. 

Another Good Carpet Cleaner. 

Every morning when you empty your coffee grounds 
have a little lard bucket on the back porch and empty 
them into this bucket and leave off top; next morning 
they will be thoroughly dry. Then continue each morn- 
ing to put in grounds until bucket is full. Then put 
on top and set aside until ready for use and fill as 
many buckets as wanted. Then give a general house 
sweeping. You will find that cleans out all the dirt 
beautifully and also keeps dust from fiying around on 
furniture, curtains, etc.
