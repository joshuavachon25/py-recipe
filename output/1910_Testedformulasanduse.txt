PREFACE 



I have been practically engaged in the 
Drug business for nearly half a century, and 
have been so successful in Counter Prescrib- 
ing, that a number of prominent Farmers 
(who had been dealing with me for many 
years), anxious to preserve the many valuable 
Formulas and Treatments which I had used, 
desired that 1 should publish a book contain- 
ing the same, to which request I have acceded, 
in the firm belief that the purchasers will be 
benefited many times over and above the cost 
of the volume because of the practical informa- 
tion contained therein. 

This book contains the formulas and recipes 
of a lifelong experience, and on account of the 
necessarily limited sale of a volume of this 
nature the cost is proportionately high; it 
has been found impossible to make the price 
less than marked, and have any reasonable 
profit to tie author, taking into consideration 
the time taken in compiling and preparing this 
volume for publication. 



6 PREFACE 



I would consider it a favor if owners of 
copies of my book would refer would-be bor- 
rowers of the volume to the author. 

The formulas have all been thoroughly tried 
and tested, and will be found efficient and reli- 
able for any case recommended. 

They are written in plain English as far as 
possible, so that the ordinary man may know 
what he is using without having to go to a 
doctor or druggist to interpret them for him.

Alum is dissolved; then add Powdered Nut 
Gall, 2 oz., and strain through coarse linen or

as many times daily as you can afford time. It 
is a powerful astringent and will soon so affect 
ligament, that joint will stay in its place; when 
commencing to use above be sure Stifle Joint is 
in its place. 

I have known the above do the work, after 
the usual treatment of Blistering, Liniments

ANIMAL 39 



Itchy Legs in Horses. 

When you find your horse constantly stamp- 
ing and rubbing legs together and sometimes 
biting at them, it is certain to be partly caused 
by a parasite (or small insect) working 
between the cuticle and tissue covering the 
muscles. 

The following ointment well rubbed in will 
soon completely cure the animal. I have sent 
a large amount of this ointment to outside

Lymphangitis. 

This disease usually commences with a chill, 
rise in temperature and nervous uneasiness 
soon followed by lameness in one hind leg, and

Cheap and Good Outdoor Paint. 

I obtained the following recipe for making a 
really good, reliable paint, twenty years ago, 
made it, and tried it on my stable, and found it 
altogether superior to White Lead and Boiled 
Oil. 

Take twenty-five pounds of Rice and boil 
in boiler until Rice loses its form and becomes 
a mucilage; strain through cloth; if any Rice 
left undissolved put back, add a little water, 
boil again and strain; then take one-half bushel 
of good fresh lime, put in barrel and pour hot 
water on it, a little at a time, till lime all slacked, 
then pass through sieve; put slacked lime in 
Rice Emulsion and stir well ; then add sufficient 
water to make thirty gallons and add four 
gallons of Boiled Oil, stirring all thoroughly; 
then add ten pounds Venetian Red, or if Dark 
Color (Slate) wanted, two pounds Lampblack 
previously mixed with Turpentine. 

This makes an ordinary barrel of paint, 
superior to White Lead and Boiled Oil for out- 
doors. It will soon dry, and becomes hard and 
glossy and will not peel off or blister. 



MISCELLANEOUS 127 



The success of this paint depends on pro- 
perly emulsifying the rice, the rest is easy, and 
now that lumber is so expensive it will well re- 
pay any farmer to paint his buildings and pre- 
serve then. I can confidently recommend the 
above. 



Bee and Wasp Stings. 

The sting of a bee being barbed, like a fish 
hook, is nearly always left in the wound; this 
should be removed at once, and either a paste 
made of Common Whiting and water smeared 
over wound, or Spirits of Ammonia applied; 
either will prevent pain and subsequent 
swelling. The sting of a Wasp is pointed and 
does not remain in wound; a slice of an onion 
rubbed well over it, will take out the pain. 

To Cure Mosquito Bites. 

Apply Sweet Spirits of Nitre, or Hartshorn 
and Water (teaspoonful to two tablespoonfuls 
of water). Either treatment will allay the 
itching or soreness almost immediately. 



128 TESTED FORMULAS 



Harness Dressing. 

Take 2 quarts of Rain or Snow Water and 
dissolve l'/2 ounces Extract of Logwood, 
bringing it to a boil and occasionally stirring. 
Then add: 

Prussiate of Potash 1 dram. 

Bichromate of Potash 1 dram. 

Borax 3 ounces. 

Gum Shellac Yi ounce. 

Keep all boiling till all dissolved and when 
cold is ready for use. 

This is an excellent dressing and will not 
burn leather. 



To Disinfect a Cellar. 

A damp, musty floor will be sweetened and 
disinfected by sprinkling Powdered Green 
Copperas or Chloride of Lime on it.. The 
walls should be washed with Yi pound 
Chloride of Lime to one gallon of water.

MISCELLANEOUS 129 



To Kill Caterpillars. 

Boil together equal quantities of Rue, Worm- 
wood and Tobacco in water to make a strong 
decoction; sprinkle on the leaves and young 
branches every morning and evening during 
the time the fruit is ripening. 

This is good for Gooseberry and Currant 
Bushes.

Tincture of Jamaica Ginger .2'/2 drams. 

Tartaric Acid 3 drams. 

Tincture of Capsicum l|/2 drams. 

White Sugar 2 pounds. 

Boiling Water 3 quarts. 

Mix the Sugar and Tartaric Acid together in 
boiling water; stir well till Sugar dissolved, 
then add Ginger and Capsicum; put in bottles 
and shake up well. 

From dessertspoonful to a tablespoonful 
put in glass of cold water, makes a nice refresh- 
ing drink.

Fly Poison. 

Make a strong infusion of Quassia Chips, 
and sweeten with White Sugar, and pour into 
plates enough to nicely cover them, and place 
where the flies congregate. 



A Splendid Whitewash. 

For In or Out-doors. 

Unslaked Lime Yi bushel. 

Ground Rice 3 pounds. 

Spanish Whiting Vi pound. 

White Glue !^ pound. 

Slake Lime in boiling water; strain and add 
fifteen pounds Salt previously dissolved in hot 
water; boil Rice to a thin paste; dissolve Glue 
and Whiting in hot water; mix all together 
and allow to stand six or seven days; stir 
thoroughly and heat sufficient for use. 

This will last nearly as long as White Lead 
and Oil, and will not rub off. 



MISCELLANEOUS 133 



Fire-Proof Paint for Roofs. 

Slake Stone Lime in a barrel well covered; 
then pass through a fine sieve: to every six 
quarts of Lime add two and one-quarter 
pounds Salt (Rock Salt preferred), and one 
gallon of water; boil and skim clean; then to 
every five gallons of this, add twelve ounces 
of Potash and four quarts of fine White Sand. 

Apply with large paint or whitewash brush 
and stir often. 

It will stop up small cracks and prevent leak- 
ing and becomes fireproof, and lasts well. 
If you desire it Venetian Red or Lampblack 
can be used to color it. 



Lice on Turnips. 

As soon as plants are well up, say two inches 
high, scatter fine slaked Lime lightly over 
them and you will have no lice on them; it is 
simple, but will do the work. 

N.B. — Cabbage can be similarly treated. 



134 TESTED FORMULAS 



To Soften Hard Putty. 

Soft Soap, mixed with solution of Potash or 
Caustic Soda or Pearlash and Slaked Lime, 
sufficient to form a paste; put on with a brush 
or woollen rag and allowed to remain one to 
two hours, will so soften it as to make it easily 
removable. 



Bottle Wax. 

Dark Resin 18 ounces. 

Gum Shellac 1 ounce. 

Beeswax 1 ounce. 

Melt all together and add Venetian Red, Red 
Lead or Lampblack for coloring. 

The above will be found very useful to seal 
bottles of Catsup, Pickles, Fruits or Jellies, or 
anything from which you wish the air ex- 
cluded. 

When using, put on stove till melted, and 
dip top of bottle in, turning it round and with- 
drawing, and when cool will become hard and 
air-tight.

Butter, washing well with clean cold water. 



Vine Blight. 

Remove the earth from around stems of 
Vine and scatter a handful of Sublimed Sul- 
phur; then replace the earth. 



136 TESTED FORMULAS 

Horse Attention. 

As an ounce of prevention is said to be better 
than a pound of cure, the following will be 
found useful to all horse owners: 

Try and remember, that the horse, as domes- 
tic with us, lives under very different conditions 
than those under which he lives and thrives in 
his native wilds, which should as far as pos- 
sible be duplicated in our treatment of him. 
Hay and oats are good feed, but he needs 
more; watch his bowels, and if dung dry and 
hard, feed him soft feed, such as bran mash, 
roots or flax seed. If you notice his water 
milky, dark colored or scanty, feed him 
crushed juniper berries until he becomes right. 

Feed him regularly, and not more at a time 
than he can properly digest, and above all, 
don't feed him an extra feed of oats on a day 
he may have an extra hard journey, as it is 
nearly sure to do him harm. 

A warm stable is a good thing, but be sure 
and have it well ventilated, and provided with 
pure fresh air, but without draughts. 



MISCELLANHOUS KV 



How TO Measure Medicine. 

One Teaspoon holds about 60 drops or 1 dram. 
One Dessertspoon holds about ... .2 drams. 

One Tablespoon holds about 4 drams. 

An ordinary Teacup holds about . . .4 ounces. 
One Tumbler holds about 8 ounces. 



Lamp and Lantern Glasses. 

To prevent from cracking, from heat or 
draughts, put glasses in a pot of cold water 
and bring to a boil, then take off and allow 
them to cool in the water; this will anneal 
them, and prevent them cracking, and it will 
pay to do it. 



Fly Poison. 

Boil some Quassia Chips in a little water 
for one-half hour and strain ; then sweeten with 
Sugar, Honey or Molasses and place in saucers. 
This will destroy flies, but is harmless to chil- 
dren. 



138 TESTEO FORMULAS 



Liquid Blacking. 

Mix 14 pound of Ivory Black. 
Six gills of good Vinegar. 
One tablespoonful of Sweet Oil. 
Ten large tablespoonfuls of molasses. 

Stir all together over a gentle heat till 
thoroughly incorporated and it is fit for im- 
mediate use. 



To Preserve Meats. 

Cut up meat in suitable pieces, rub salt 
thoroughly into them, and allow to remain for 
twenty-four hours; take pieces out and allow 
them to drain; then repack in clean vessel; 
then put on a previously prepared pickle made 
as follows: For every one hundred pounds of 
meat take seven pounds of salt and one ounce 
each of Saltpetre and Cayenne pepper, and 
one quart of Molasses and eight gallons soft 
water; boil together and skim well and when 
cold pour over the meat. 



MISCELLANEiOUS 139 



Ant Poison. 

Many housekeepers are annoyed with Ants 
in their pantrys and closets, the following will 
rid you of them: Take one-half ounce of 
Tartar Emetic and mix with two ounces of 
Powdered White Sugar and place on shelving 
where they can get it, and you will be sur- 
prised and pleased at their quick disappear- 
ance. 



To Prevent Fence Posts Rotting. 

Take boiled Linseed Oil and stir into it 
Powdered Charcoal till it is of the consistency 
of heavy paint; apply to the posts and allow 
to dry before planting in ground, and they will 
last three times as long as they would without 
this treatment, which is inexpensive. 



140 TESTED FORMULAS 



Cracks in Stoves, Pipes and Ovens. 

When a crack is discovered through which 
fire or smoke penetrates, sift some Hardwood 
Ashes and add an equal quantity of Common 
Salt, mixing into a paste with cold water; then 
apply to crack so as to completely fill opening; 
it will soon harden, and fire will not affect it. 



Kid Glove Cleaner. 

Add fifteen or twenty drops of Liquid 
Ammonia to half pint of Turpentine; fit gloves 
on hand and apply mixture with a brush; fol- 
low up by rubbing on some fine Pumice Stone; 
rub with flannel or sponge dipped in the mix- 
ture, after well rubbing in; rub off Pumice 
and repeat, and if not very much soiled gloves 
will be thoroughly clean.
