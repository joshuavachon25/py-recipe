COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 



I. 



CONSUMPTIOX. 

DURING the last half-centiny the con- 
sumption of cocoa in various forms 
has increased to an extraordinary extent, 
both in this country and Great Britain. 
This is due to several causes, among the 
most prominent of which are, (i) a reduc- 
tion in the retail price, w^hich brings it 
within the means of the poorer classes ; (3) 
a more general recognition of the value of 
cocoa as an article of diet, and (3) im- 
provements in methods of preparation, by 
which it is adapted to the wants of diher- 
ent classes of consumers. 



2 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

There is no doubt that, if it had not 
been for the monopoly of the production 
which Spain long possessed, and which 
kept the price, on its first introduction 
into England, at a point where only the 
rich could afibrd to buy it, cocoa would 
have come into as general use thei"e as it 
did in Spain, and would, perhaps, have 
been received with more favor than tea or 
coffee, which were introduced about the 
same time. 

It appears that, in the time of Charles 
II., the price of the best chocolate (very 
crude, undoubtedly, as compared with 
the present manufactures), was 6s. 8d. a 
pound, which, if we take into account the 
greater purchasing power of money at that 
time, would be equal to at least $5 a pound 
at this time for a coarse compound. 

Humboldt estimated the consumption of 
cocoa in Europe, in 1S06, at 23,000,000 
pounds per annum, of which from 6,000,000 
to 9,000,000 were supposed to be consumed 



CONSUMPTION. 6 

in Spain. From the latest official returns of 
imports and consumption in the principal 
countries it appears that over 70^000,000 
pounds are now used. France heads the 
list with 26,750,250 pounds ; Spain comes 
next, with 16,450,000; England consumes 
13,966,512; the Netherlands, 5,475,000; 
Germany, about 3,250,000, and Belgium, 
1,245,000. The United States stands next 
to Great Britain in the list of consumers, 
the amount of crude cocoa entered for con- 
sumption last year being about 8,500,000 
pounds. The returns of exjoortations from 
the countries in which the article is pro- 
duced are so incomplete that it is im- 
possible to state definitely the total amount 
exported ; but it is probably not far 
from 80,000,000 pounds per annum. 
Reckoning the consumption in the coun- 
tries where it is raised at not less than 
20,000,000 pounds, it may safely be as- 
sumed that the total annual product does 
not fall short of 100,000,000 pounds. 



4: COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

While the average price of the raw prod- 
uct has steadily increased during the last 
thirty years (from 47s. per cwt., between 
1854-60, to 74s. between 1881-84'), the 
retail price of the prepared cocoa has 
fallen. This is due to improvements in 
machinery and methods of handling, and 
to the sharp competition between the lead- 
ing manufacturers. 

In 1S20 the quantity of cocoa entered for 
home consumption in the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Ireland was only 
267,321 pounds; in 18S4 it amounted to 
13,966,512 pounds of crude cocoa, and 
1,033,173 pounds of chocolate, — in all 
about 15,000,000 pounds, an increase of 
5,500 per cent, in sixty-four years. The 
population, in the meantime, had increased 
only 73^ per cent. ; the use of tea had in- 
creased only 457 per cent., and of coffee 
only 356 per cent. During the last twenty- 

iMulhiill's (English) Price Lists. 



CONSUMPTION. 5 

five years the consumption of cocoa and its 
products in the United Kingdom has in- 
creased about 230 per cent. The con- 
sumption per inhabitant is about 6^/5 oz. 

In the United States the increased con- 
sumption in recent years has been no less 
striking. The amount of cocoa retained 
for home consumption in i860 was only 
1,181,054 pounds ; in 18S5 it was 8,426,787 
pounds (that is, cocoa, crude cocoa and 
shells, not including chocolate, which is 
classed, in the official returns of imports, 
under the general head of " farinaceous 
articles"), — an increase of 614 per cent, 
in twenty-five years. The population in- 
creased during that period less than 60 per 
cent. The consumption of tea increased 
153 per cent., and of coffee 196 per cent. 

In view, therefore, of the great and 
constantly increasing use of this product, 
its properties and supply become questions 
of the highest economic and hygienic im- 
portance. For the purpose of satisfying 



6 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

the desire for information upon a subject 
which is of such general interest we have 
collected, from the most authentic sources, 
such facts in relation to the growth of 
the cacao-tree, the preparation of its fruit for 
the market, and tlie value of tlie difterent 
preparations for dietary purposes, as may 
serve to increase the common stock of 
knowledge in regard to one of the staple 
articles of food. 



THE CACAO-TREE. 



II. 

THE CACAO-TREE. 

THE term " Cocoa" is a corruption of 
" Cacao," but is almost universally 
used in English-speaking countries. The 
cacao-tree belongs to the natural order of 
Sterculiacece, — a family of about 41 gen- 
era and 521 species, inhabiting the warmer 
regions of the world. None of them grow 
naturally in our climate, or in Europe, 
and, excepting the little yellow-fiovvered 
Mahernie, they are very seldom seen in our 
conservatories. 

The cacao-tree can be cultivated in suit- 
able situations within the 25th parallels of 
latitude. It flourishes best, however, with- 
in the 15th parallels, at elevations varying 
from near the sea-level up to about 2,000 
feet in height. The following table con-

Besides the above-mentioned sjDecies, 
distinguished by botanists, T'. Cacao, 
which is the most widely and hirgely cul- 
tivated, is divided by cocoa-planters into 
several varieties, the differences observed 
being due to the long-continued influences 
of varied climates, soils and modes of cult- 
ure. The best of these is the Creole (or 
Criollo of the Spanish inhabitants of South 
America). The pods are small; but the 
nuts are thick, short, and almost globular, 
pale crimson in color, and of slightly bitter 
but agreeable flavor. This variety is 



10 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

becoming scarce, chiefly through the bad 
policy of rephicing decayed trees by in- 
ferior specimens. The next variety is the 
jForastcro, the best kinds of which are the 
Ctindeamar^ of two descriptions, one with 
yellow, the other with red pods. The 
former is the better, containing large seeds 
which, in color and the ease with which 
they ai"e fermented, resemble the Criollo. 
The third variety is the Amelojtado ; and 
the fomth and lowest is the Calabacillo, 
whose seeds are small, bitter, and of a dark 
crimson color. 

All the varieties except the Criollo^ 
which is probably confined to Venezuela, 
are known collectively as T'rijzitario, or 
" Trinidad," — the best being but little in- 
ferior to Criollo in the matter of quality, 
and superior on the score of fruitfulness. 
Hence Trinidad forms the principal nursery 
from which plants or seeds are procured 
for new plantations. 

The various kinds of cocoa may be 



THE CACAO-TREE. 11 

placed in about the following order of 
merit : Soconusco (Mexico) and Esmeralda, 
(Ecuador), mostly, it is said, consumed at 
home ; Cai"acas and Puerto Cabello (Vene- 
zuela) ; Trinitario ; Magdalena and Car- 
thagena. New Granada ; Para ; Bahia.^ 

The British West Indies appear to take 
the lead among the producers for exporta- 
tion ; Ecuador stands second, Venezuela 
third, and Brazil fourth. The larger part 
of the Brazilian crop goes to France ; and 
the larger part of the Ecuadorian to 
Spain. 

A French officer who served in the West 
Indies for a period of fifteen years, during 
the early part of the last century, wrote, as 
the result of his personal observations, a 
treatise on "The Natural History of Choco- 
late, being a distinct and particular Account 
of the Cacao-Tree, its Growth and Culture, 

iSpon's Encyclopedia, etc., Div. II.

and the Preparation, Excellent Properties, 
and Medicinal Virtues of its Fruit," which 
received the approbation of the Regent of 
the Faculty of Medicine at Paris, and 
which was translated and published in 
London in i730« 

From this rare and valuable little work 
the following extracts are made : — 

" The cacao-tree almost all the year 
bears fruit of all ages, which ripens suc- 
cessively, but never grows on the end of 
little branches, as our fruits in Europe do, 
but along the trunk and chief boughs, 
which is not rare in these countries, where 
several trees do the like. Such an unusual 
appearance would seem strange in the eyes 
of Europeans, who have never seen any- 
thing of that kind ; but, if one examines 
the matter a little, the philosophical reason 
of this disposition is very obvious. One 
may easily apprehend that if nature had 
placed such bulkv fruit at the ends of the 
branches their gfreat weigrht must necessa- 



THE CACAO-TREE. 13 

rily break them, and the fruit would fall 
before it came to maturity. 

"The fruit is contained in a husk, or shell, 
which, from an exceedingly small begin- 
ning, attains in the space of four months to 
the bigness and shape of a cucumber. The 
lower end is sharp, and furrowed length- 
wise like a melon. This shell in the first 
months is either red or white, or a mixture 
of red and yellow. This variety of colors 
makes three sorts of cacao-trees, which 
have nothing else to distinguish them but 
this. . . . If one cleaves one of these shells 
lengthways it will appear almost half an 
inch thick, and its capacity full of choco- 
late kernels ; the intervals of which, before 
they are ripe, are filled with a hard white 
substance, which at length turns into a 
mucilage of a very grateful acidity. For 
this reason it is common for people to take 
some of the kernels with their covers and 
hold them in their mouths, which is mighty 
refreshing, and proper to quench thirst. 



14 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

But they take heed of biting them, because 
the fihns of the kernels are extremely bitter. 
" When one nicely examines the inward 
structure of these shells, and anatomizes, 
as it were, all their parts, one shall find 
that the fibres of the stalk of the fruit pass- 
ing through the shell are divided into 
five branches ; that each of tiiese branches 
is subdivided into several filaments, every 
one of which terminates at the larger end 
of these kernels, and altogether resembles 
a bunch of grapes, containing from twenty 
to thirty-five single ones, or more, ranged 
and»placed in an admirable order. When 
one takes off the film that covei's one of the 
kernels the substance of it appears, which 
is tender, smooth, and inclining to violet 
color, and is seemingly divided into several 
lobes, though in reality they are but two ; 
but very irregular and difficult to be disen- 
gfagred from each other." 



fc>"to^ 



An interesting supplement to this de- 



THE CACAO-TREE. 15 

scriptioii of the product in the \Vest Indies, 
written more than a centur}' and a half ago, 
will be found in the following report, made 
last year to the State Department at Wash- 
ington, by the U.S. Consul at La Guayra, 
in relation to the cultivation of cocoa in 
Venezuela, where the choicest variety of 
the exported product, the Caracas, is 
raised : — 

" The tree grows to the average height of 
thirteen feet, and from five to eight inches 
in diameter, is of spreading habit and 
healthy growth, and, although requiring 
much more care and attention than the 
cofiee-tree, yet its equally reliable crops 
require comparatively liltle labor in prop- 
erly preparing for the market. 

"... There are two varieties of the 
cocoa-tree cultivated in Venezuela, known 
as El Criollo and El Trinitario, respec- 
tively, the former of which, though not so 
prolific nor as early fruiting as the latter, 
is yet superior to it in size, color, sweet- 



16 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

ness, and oleaginous properties of the fruit, 
and in the flict that it always finds ready- 
sale, while the latter is often dull or neg- 
lected. The diflerence in price of the two 
varieties is also marked, the former being 
quoted at $38 to $30 per fanega (no 
pounds), while the latter commands ap- 
proximately half that price. 

" While cofiee can be successfully culti- 
vated under a temperature of 60 degrees 
F., the cocoa-tree, for proper development 
and remunerative crops, requires a tem- 
perature of 80 degrees F. ; hence the area 
of the cocoa belt is comparatively re- 
stricted, and the cocoa-planter presumably 
has not to fear the fierce competition that 
he has encountered in the cultivation of 
cotton and coffee. Besides the condition 
of tempei'ature above stated, this crop 
needs a moist soil and humid atmosphere, 
and so the lands along the coast of the 
Caribbean sea, sloping from the mountain- 
tops to the shore, bedewed by the exha- 



THE CACAO-TREE. 17 

lations of the sea and irrigated by the 
numerous rivulets that course down the 
valleys, are found to be, in all respects, 
well adapted to the profitable cultivation 
of cocoa. And while the lands in the 
interior possessing facilities for irrigation 
may be said to be equally as good for 
the purpose, yet the absence of roads, and 
the consequently difficult transportation of 
produce on the backs of donkeys over 
rugged mountain paths, materially reduce 
tlie profits on the crop before it reaches 
the market. 

" A cocoa plantation is set in quite the 
same manner as an apple-orchard, except 
that the young stalks may be transplanted 
from the nursery after two months' growth. 
No preparation of the soil is deemed neces- 
saiy, and no manures are applied. The 
young trees are planted about fifteen feet 
equidistant, which will accommodate two 
hundred trees to the acre. Between rows, 
and at like spaces, are planted rows of the 



18 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

Bucare, a tree of rapid growth, that serves 
to shade the soil as well as to shield the 
young trees from the torrid sun. Small 
permanent trenches must be maintained 
from tree to tree throughout the entire 
length of the rows, so that, at least once 
in the week, the stream, descending from 
the mountains, may be turned into these 
little channels and bear needful moisture 
to trees and soil. At the age of five years 
the plantation begins to bear fruit, and 
annually yields two crops, that ripening in 
June being termed the crop of San Juan, 
and that maturing at Christmas being 
known as the crop of La Navidad. The 
average age to which tlie trees attain, 
under proper care, may be estimated at 
forty years, during which period it will 
give fair to full crops of fruit ; but of 
course it must be understood that, as in 
our fruit-orchards, a new tree must be set 
from time to time to replace one that may 
be decayed or blighted. After careful 



THE CACAO-TREE. 19 

inquiry it may be safely stated that the 
average crop of the cocoa plantation at 
ten years of age, and under a proper state 
of cultivation, will amount to five hundred 
or six hundred pounds per acre. 

" The fruit or seed of the cocoa, in form, 
size, and color, is quite similar to the 
almond. These seeds, to the number of 
sixty or eighty,^ are encased in a pod, 

1 This statement is incorrect. The average number is 
about twenty-five ; the maximum number would not exceed 
forty. It is curious to note tlie different statements of those 
who are regarded as authorities on tlie subject. Dampier 
("A New Voyage round the World") says there are com- 
monly near a hundred; Thomas Ga;-e (" New Survey 
of the West Indies ") says there are from thirty to forty; 
Colmenero (" A Curious Discourse upon Chocolate ") stiys 
ten or twelve; Oexmelin ("The History of Adventures ") 
says ten to fourteen. The French officer, in his " Natural 
History of Chocolate," says (and says truly), " I can affirm, 
after athousand trials, that I never found more nor less than 
twenty-five. Perhaps, if one were to seek out tlie largest 
shells in the most fruitful soil and growing on the most 
flourishing trees, one might find forty kernels; but as it is 
not likely one would ever meet with more, so, on the other 
hand, it is not probable one would ever find less than fifteen 
except they are abortive, or the fruit of a tree worn out witli 
age in a barren soil, or witliout culture." 



20 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

which, except in color, is the counterpart 
of a young muskmelon, being elongated 
and ribbed in the same manner. Its color, 
when green, is like that of the egg-plant, 
but, on ripening, it assumes a reddish 
hue. A peculiarity of the cocoa is that 
it bears fruit " from the ground up," the 
trunk yielding fruit as well as the 
branches. Upon ripening, the pods are 
gathered from the trees and heaped in 
piles on the ground, where they are left 
for some days to ferment, after which they 
burst open, when the seed must be shelled 
out. After a light exposure to the sun, 
during which time great care must be 
taken to protect them from the rain, they 
are sacked and ready for market. 

" The cocoa-trees, when very young, 
require to be carefully watched, to protect 
them from the ravages of the borers, which, 
instead of entering the trees near the ground 
or in the roots, as is the case with the 
borers in our peach-orchards, burrow under 



THE CACAO-TREE. 21 

the bark of the trunk and girdle the trees. 
After a few years of care all danger from 
this source is removed. The only disease 
to which the tree is subject is la mancha^ 
which is an affection similar to the pear 
blight in the United States, though not so 
obstinate and fatal, and which, by promptly 
cutting away the diseased bai-k, may be 
usually arrested. The squirrels and wood- 
peckers also must be guarded against, as 
they are very fond of the young fruit. It 
happens too, though rarely, that a period 
of ten or twelve days of continuous rainy 
and cloudy weather ensues, in which event 
much of the fruit is blighted and falls from 
the trees. These, it is believed, comprise 
all the casualties to which the tree and the 
green crop are exposed ; but which, when 
compared with the usual contingencies that 
affect our own orchards and fruit crops, 
may not be considered more damaging or 
discouraging. 

" In the tiilaofe of the soil and the econo- 



22 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

mies of agriculture the people of Vene- 
zuela arc probably not in advance of those 
who scratched and scraped the earth before 
the deluge. A people that will plough 
with a forked stick, and plant corn with an 
iron crow-bar, as is practised here, have 
much to learn in respect to the laws of 
nature and the appliances of art. And 
the resultant idea, on a practical review of 
the subject, is that, if a fair amount of 
intelligent industry and care could be in- 
vested in the cultivation of this crop, it 
would undoubtedly yield a surprisingly 
satisfactory percentage of remunerative 
returns." 

The method of preparing the fruit for 
shipment is thus described in the recent edi- 
tion of the " EncyclopjEdia Britannica " : — 

" In gathering, the workman is careful 
to cut down only fully ripened pods, which 
he adroitly accomplishes with a long pole 
armed with two prongs, or a knife at its 



THE CACAO-TREE. 23 

extremity. The pods are left in a heap on 
the ground for about twenty-four hours ; 
they are then cut open and the seeds are 
taken out and carried in baskets to the 
place where they undergo the oj^eration of 
sweating or curing. There the acid juice 
which accompanies the seeds is first drained 
off, after which they are placed in a sweat- 
ing-box, in which they are enclosed and 
allowed to ferment for some time, great 
care being taken to keep the temperature 
from rising too high. The fermenting 
process is, in some cases, affected by throw- 
ing the seeds into holes or trenches in the 
ground and covering them with earth or 
clay. The seeds in this process, which is 
called claying, are occasionally stirred to 
keep the fermentation from proceeding too 
violently. The sweating is a process which 
requires the very greatest attention and 
experience, as on it, to a great extent, de- 
pends the flavor of the seeds and their fit- 
ness for preservation. The operation varies 



24 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

according to the state of the weather, but a 
period of about two days yields the best 
results. Thereafter the seeds are exposed 
to the sun for drying, and those of a fine 
quality should then assume a warm, red- 
dish tint, which characterizes beans of a 
superior quality." 

The shell of the nut is prolonged in the 
form of thin septa into the inner part of 
the seed. The relative proportions of 
shell and nib are approximately as i : 8, 
the nib being much the more abundant. 
They varj'^ considerably in size. Single 
seeds may be picked out which weigh 
as much as 3.7 grammes ; ' but the average 
weight is much less, viz., 1.2 grammes. 

The following determinations of the 
weights of the different kinds of seeds were 
made by J. Alfred Wanklyn, the well- 
known analyst : — 

1 A gramme is equal to 15-432 English grains.

The nut, in its unprepared condition, 
is not an article of retail trade. Before 
it reaches the consumer it requires much 
preparation, and without such preparation 
it is in as impracticable a condition as 
unground grain before the miller has con- 
verted it into flour.

EARLY USE. 



THE name chocolate is nearly the same 
in most European languages, and is 
taken from the Mexican name of the 
drink, chocolatl, or cacahuatl, Atl is 
common enough in Mexican words, and 
is known to signify water. What the first 
part of the word means is not so clear. A 
French writer saj-s it signifies noise ; and 
that the drink was so named because it was 
beaten to a froth before being drunk. 

The Spaniards found chocolate in com- 
mon use among the Mexicans at the time 
of the invasion under Cortez, in 1519, and 
it was introduced into Spain immediately 
after. The Mexicans not only used choco- 
late as a staple article of food, but they used 
the seeds of the cacao-tree as a medium 



EARLY USE. 27 

of exchange. An early writer says, "In 
certain provinces called Guatimala and 
Soconusco there is growing a great store 
of cacao, which is a berry like unto an 
almond. It is the best merchandise that is 
in all the Indies. The Indians make drink 
of it, and in like manner meat to eat. It 
goeth currently for money in any market, 
or fair, and may buy flesh, fish, bread 
or cheese, or other tilings." 

In the " True History of the Conquest 
of Mexico," by Bernal Diaz, an officer 
under Cortez, it is related that " from time 
to time a liquor prepared from cocoa and 
of a stimulating or corroborative quality, 
as we are told, was presented to Mon- 
tezuma in a golden cup. We could not at 
the time see if he drank it or not, but I 
observed a number of jars — above fifty — 
brought in and filled Vv'ith foaming choco- 
late." 

Thomas Gage, in his "New Survey of 



28 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

the West Indies," first published in 1648, 
gives the following interesting account of 
the Spanish and Indian way of making and 
drinking chocolate some two hundred and 
fifty years ago : — 

"Now, for the making or compounding 
of this drink, I shall set down here the 
method. The cacao and the other ingre- 
dients must be beaten in a mortar of stone, 
or (as the Indians use) ground upon a 
brojrd stone, which they call Metate^ and 
is only made for that use. But first the 
ingredients are all to be dried, except the 
Achiotte (annotto), with care that they be 
beaten to powder, keeping them still in 
stirring that they be not burnt, or become 
black ; for if they be ovsrdried they will be 
bitter and lose their virtue. The cinnamon 
and the long red pepper are to be first 
beaten with the anniseed, and then the 
cacao, which must be beaten by little and 
little till it be all powdered, and in the 
beating it must be turned round that it may 



EARLY USE. 29 

mix the better. Every one of these ingredi- 
ents must be beaten by itself, and then all be 
put into the vessel where the cacao is, 
which you must stir together with a spoon, 
and then take out that paste, and put it 
into the mortar, under which there must 
be a little fire, after the confection is made ; 
but if more fire be put under than will only 
warm it, then the unctuous part will dry 
awa}'. The Achlotte also must be put in 
in the beating, that it may the better take 
the colour. All the ingi^edients must be 
searced, save only the cacao, and if from 
the cacao the dry shell be taken, it will be 
the better. When it is well beaten and in- 
corporated (which will be known by the 
shortnesse of it) then with a spoon (so in 
the Indias is used) is taken up some of the 
paste, which will be almost liquid, and 
made into tablets, or else without a spoon 
put into boxes, and when it is cold it will 
be hard. 

"Those that make it into tablets put a 



30 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

spoonful of the paste upon a piece of 
paper (the Indians put it upon the leaf of 
a plaintain tree), where, being put into 
the shade (for in the sun it melts and dis- 
solves), it grows hard; and then bowing 
the paper or leaf, the tablet fals off by 
reason of the fatnesse of the paste. But if 
it be put into anything of earth or wood, it 
stickes fast, and will not come off but with 
scraping or breaking. The manner of 
drinking it is divers ; the one (being the 
way most used in Mexico) is to take it 
hot with Atolle, dissolving a tablet in hot 
water, and stirring and beating it in the 
cup, when it is to be drunk, with a Moli- 
net, and Vv^hen it is well stirred to a scumme 
or froth, then to fill the cup with hot 
Atolle, and so drink it sujd by sup. An- 
other way is that the chocolate, being dis- 
solved with cold water and stirred with the 
Mclinet, and the scumme being taken off 
and put into another vessel, the remainder 
be set upon the fire, with as much sugar 






EARLY USE. 31 

as will sweeten it, and when it is warme, 
then to powre it upon the scumme which 
was taken ofl' before, and so to drink it. 
But the most ordinary way is to warme the 
water very hot, and then to powre out 
half the cup full that you mean to drink; 
and to put into it a tablet or two, or as 
much as will thicken reasonably the water, 
and then grinde it well with the Molinet, 
and when it is well ground and risen to a 
scumme, to fill the cup with hot water, and 
so drink it by sups (having sweetened it 
with sugar), and to eat it with a little con- 
sei've or maple bred, steeped into the 
chocolatte. 

" Besides these vv'ays there is another way 
(which is much used in the Island of Santo 
Domingo), which is to put the chocolatte 
into a pipkin with a little water, and to let 
it boyle well till it be dissolved, and then 
to put in sufficient water and sugar accord- 
ing to the quantity of the chocolatte, and 
then to boyle it again untill there comes 



32 COCOA ATs'D CHOCOLATE. 

an oily scumme upon it, .and then to drink 
it. 

"There is another way yet to drink choco- 
latte, which is cold, whicli the Indians use 
at feasts to refresh tliemselves, and it is 
made after this manner : Tlie chocohitte 
(wliich is made with none, or very few, 
ingredients) being dissolved in cold water 
with the Molinet, they take off the scumme 
or crassy part, which riseth in great quan- 
tity, especially when the cacao is older and 
more putrefied. The scumme they lay aside 
in a little dish by itself, and then put sugar 
into that part from M'hence was taken the 
scumme, and then powre it from on high 
into the scumme, and so drink it cold. 
And this drink is so cold that it agreeth 
not with all men's stomachs ; for by ex- 
perience it hath been found that it doth 
hurt by causing pains in the stomach, es- 
pecially to women. 

" The third way of taking it is the most 
used, and thus certainly it doth no hurt. 



EARLY USE. 33 

neither know I why it may not be used as 
well in England as in other parts, both 
hot and cold ; for where it is so much used, 
the most, if not all, as well in the Indias 
as in Spain, Italy, Flanders (which is a 
cold countrey) , find that it agreeth well with 
them. True it is, it is used more in the 
Indias than in the European parts, because 
there the stomachs are more apt to faint 
than here, and a cup of chocolatte well 
confectioned coinforts and strengthens the 
stomach. For myself I must say, I used 
it twelve years constantly, drinking one 
cup in the morning, another yet before 
dinner between nine or ten of the clock ; 
another within an hour or two after dinner, 
and another between four and five in the 
afternoon ; and when I was purposed to 
sit up late to study, I would take another 
cup about seven or eight at night, which 
would keep me waking till about midnight. 
And if by chance I did neglect any of 
these accustomed houres, I presently found 



I

my stomach fainty. And with this custome 
I lived twelve 3'ears in those parts healthy, 
without any obstructions, or oppilations, 
not knowing: what either ague or feaver 



M. Ferdinand Denis, in " La Legende 
du CacahuatI," makes the following inter- 
esting statement in regard to the prepara- 
tion of chocolate in ancient Mexico : — 

" Torquemada, the learned historian, 
and Thomas Gage, the conscientious trav- 
eller, agree in telling us that Jiot chocolate 
was an invention of the Castilians. The 
first of these writers, who lived at the end 
of the sixteenth century, says so positively ; 
in his time it had been used for only a few 
years. 

" Would you know now what chocolate 
was Avhen the learned Antonio Colmenero 
de Ledesma gave his receipt? I copy it for 
you here : — • 

" 'Take a hundred cacao kernels, two 



EARLY USE. 35 

heads of Chili or long peppers, a handful 
of anise or orjevala, and two of mesachusil 
or vanilla, — or, instead, six Alexandria 
roses, powdered, — two drachms of cinna- 
mon, a dozen almonds and as many hazel- 
nuts, a half pound of white sugar, and 
annotto enough to color it, and you have the 
king of chocolates.' 

" I must say a word concerning another 
substance allied to the chocolate, beloved 
of the Americans. I speak oi atola^ which 
has been handed down to us. There was 
the atola of dry and of green maize ; the 
latter was served on elegant tables. Com- 
posed of maize in the milky stage, sweet- 
ened with the vegetable honey of the agave, 
sometimes, also, flavored with excellent 
vanilla, it had the appearance of blanc- 
mange. On this mixture was poured choco- 
late prepared cold. It can be understood 
how the most delicate palates could relish 
it. I say nothing here of the coarse 
mixtures of dry flour, or frisoles^ which 



36 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

were mixed with the cacao ; it was a 
vulgar food, endurable only by the com- 
mon people. 

" Not to leave too incomplete this sketch 
of various antiquities, often examined, but 
still obscure, I must touch upon the still 
less familiar subject of American ceramics, 
which will not be the least curious para- 
graph. The Mexicans had vases specially 
set apart for beverages of the most varied 
description, which were served at their fes- 
tivals, from the ordinary pulque to the most 
delicate octli. There were among them, 
without doubt, chocolate j^ots of great 
value. The historian of King Tezozomoc 
leaves us no doubt on this subject. He 
names, it is true, a series of ornamented 
vases without making us acquainted with 
their special use ; but he is much more ex- 
plicit when he speaks of a cup, ready made 
by nature, but which the goldsmith's art 
had covered with the most elegant orna- 
ments. Thanks to him, we know that 



EARLY USE. 37 

cocoa was offered to distinguished person- 
age's in a tortoise shell, highly polished and 
ornamented with gold arabesques. And it 
was very probably in this manner that Fer- 
nando Cortez drank his first chocolate." 

The Spaniards thus early acquired a 
knowledge of the fruit and of the manner 
of preparing it, which they kept secret for 
many years, selling it very profitably as 
chocollat to the wealthy and luxurious 
classes of Europe. But it was, as already 
stated, an expensive preparation, and did 
not come into use until long after the public 
coffee-houses of London were established. 

Says Brillat-Savarin, in his famous " Phys- 
iologic du Gout," "Chocolate came over 
the mountains [from Spain to France] with 
Anne of Austria, daughter of Philip III., 
and Qiieen of Louis XIII. The Spanish 
monks also spread tlie knowledge of it by 
the jDresents they made to their brothers in 
France. The various ambassadors of Spain 



38 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

also contributed to bring it into fashion ; 
and at the beginning of the Regency it 
was more universally in use than coffee, 
inasmuch as it was taken as an agreeable 
article of food, while coffee still passed 
only for a beverage of luxury and a curios- 
ity. It is well known that Linnaeus called 
the fruit of the cocoa-tree theobroina ' food 
for the gods.' The cause of this emphatic 
qualification has been sought, and attributed 
by some to the fact that he was extrava- 
gantly fond of chocolate ; b}' others to his 
desire to please his confessor ; and by 
others to his gallantry, a queen having first 
introduced it into France." 

The Spanish ladies of the New World, it 
is said, cai'ry their love for chocolate to such 
a degree that, not content with partaking of it 
several times a day, they have it sometimes 
carried after them to church. This favor- 
ing of the senses often drew upon them the 
censures of the bishop ; but the Reverend 
Father Escobar, whose metaphysics were as 



EARLY USE. 39 

subtle as his morality was accommodating, 
declared, formally, that a fast was not bro- 
ken by chocolate prepared with water ; 
thus wire-drawing, in favor of his peni- 
tents, the ancient adage: '•'• Liquidum non 
frangit jc ju n iu m." 

The earliest intimation of the introduc- 
tion of cocoa into England is found in an 
announcement in the Public Advertiser of 
Tuesday, i6th June, 1657 (more than a 
hundred and thirty years after its introduc- 
tion into Spain), stating that "in Bishops- 
gate street, in Queen's Head alley, at a 
Frenchman's house, is an excellent West 
India drink, called chocolate, to be sold, 
where you may have it ready at any time ; 
and also unmade, at reasonable rates." 

Two years later, in the Alerctirius Po- 
liticus for June, 1659, it is stated that 
" Chocolate, an excellent West India drink, 
is sold in Qiieen's Head alley, in Bishops- 
gate street, by a Frenchman who did for- 



40 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

merly sell it in Grace Church street, and 
Clement's Churchyard, being the first man 
who did sell it in England ; and its virtues 
are highly extolled." 

A book written in the time of Charles 
II., entitled " The Indian Nectar, or a 
Discourse concerning Chocolate, etc.," 
says the best kind can be purchased of one 
Mortimer, " an honest though poor man, 
living in East Smithfield," for 6s. 8d. per 
pound, and commoner sorts for about half 
that price. 

About the beginning of the eighteenth 
century chocolate had become an exceed- 
ingly fashionable beverage, and the cocoa- 
tree was a favorite sign and name for places 
of public refreshment. Cocoa and choco- 
late are frequently mentioned in contem- 
porary literature ; and among others Pope, 
in his " Rape of the Lock," alludes to it; 
the negligent spirit, fixed like Ixion, — 

"In fumes of burning chocolate shall glow, 
And tremble at the sea that froths below." 



EARLY USE. 41 

Down to a late period (1S32) the con- 
sumption of cocoa in England was confined 
within very narrow limits, owing to the 
oppressiveness of the duties with wliich it 
was loaded. The ruin of the cocoa plan- 
tations which once flourished in Jamaica 
was caused, says JNIr. Bryan Edwards, the 
historian, by the heavy hand of ministerial 
exaction. In 1S33 the duty on cocoa from 
a British possession was I'educed from 6d. 
to 2d. per pound. The result was that the 
consumption which, during the three years 
ending in 1S31, averaged only 440,578 
pounds a year, shortly increased to an 
average of 2,072,335 pounds. The duty of 
6d. per pound on foreign cocoa was con- 
tinued some time longer; but in 1S53 the 
duties were finally equalized and fixed at 
id. per poi:nd, and on paste or chocolate 
at 2d. The duties on husks and shells 
were reduced to 2s. per cwt. in 1855. 

It is stated, on what appears to be good 



42 COCOA AXD CHOCOLATE. 

authority,' that the chocolate-mill erected 
on Neponset river, in the town of Dor- 
chester, Mass, in 1765, was the first mill 
of that kind established in the British prov- 
inces of North America. It was connected 
with a saw-mill, operated by water-power, 
and was regarded as a somewhat doubtful 
experiment. Its establishment was due to 
the representations made by John Plannan, 
an Irish immigrant, who had learned the 
business of chocolate-making in England. 
The new industry prospered in a small 
way, and on the death of Hannan, in 1780, 
Dr. James Baker established the house 
which has continued the business without 
interruption from that day to this. 

In the early days the crude cocoa was 
brought to the American market by the 
Massachusetts traders, who received it in 
exchange for the fish and other articles 
which they shipped to the West Indies and 

1 History of the town of Dorchester, Mass., 1S57. 



EARLY USE. 43 

Central and South America ; and the dh-ect 
connection with the producers, thus early 
estabUshed, has ever since been maintained. 

In giving an account of the manufact- 
ures in Boston, in 1/94, J. L. Bishop, in 
his " History of American Manufoctures," 
says: "Chocolate had been long made 
from the large quantities of cocoa obtained 
in the West India trade, and had been 
greatly expedited by recent inventions. 
The chocolate-mill of Mr. Welsh, at the 
North End, could turn out 2,500 cwt. 
daily." 

It is a curious fact that on the spot where 
the industry was first started, nearly a 
century and a quarter ago, the business has 
continued and attained the highest develop- 
ment. From the small beginning by Dr. 
Baker there has grown up one of the 
greatest establishments in the world, — the 
house of Walter Baker & Co., — an estab- 
lishment which competes successfully for 
prizes in all the great industrial exhibitions

of the world, whose influence is felt in the 
great commercial centres, and whose pros- 
perity promotes the welfare of men who 
labor under a tropical sun in the cultiva- 
tion of one of the choicest fruits of the 
earth.

" The most abundant constituent of the 
seed," says Wanklyn, " is the fat, or cocoa- 
butter, which constitutes about one-half of 
the entire seed. Owing, no doubt, to this 
circumstance, the specific gravity of the 
seeds is less than unity, and they float on 
water. After being kept for some days 
in contact with the water some of the fat 
makes its escape, and the seeds sink to the 
bottom.

" From this analysis it is apparent that 
the main constituent of the ash is phos- 
phate of potash, and that there is ahuost 
total absence of carbonates. The ash of 
the shell being, as has been said, highly- 
charged with carbonates, it follows that, 
in obtaining the ash of the entire seed, we 
cause the phosphates of the nib to decom- 
pose the carbonates of the shell, and so ob- 
tain an ash devoid of carbonates. 

" The large proportion of phosphate of 
potash in cocoa (certainly not far from one 
per cent, in the seed of good quality) 
is worthy the attention of the physician, 
and no doubt gives an especial value to a 
dietaiy consisting largely of cocoa. It will 
further be observed that the fine kinds of 
cocoa-seeds are rich in phosphate of pot- 
ash 

"Mixtures of cocoa with starch and 
sugar have long been perfectly legitimate, 
provided no deception as to the strength in 
cocoa be practised." 



PROPERTIES, ETC. 51 

In conclusion he says : " The prepara- 
tions of cocoa constitute food rather than 
drink, being highly nutritious in every 
sense of the term. The fat present in 
cocoa — viz., the cocoa-butter — appears to 
be of a particularly available description. 
It is said never to become rancid, and 
merits an elaborate examination. Whether 
it be owing to peculiarities in the fat of 
cocoa, or whether it be the theobromine 
that is particularly efficient, certain it is 
that cocoa will sometimes nourish when 
nothing else will, and cocoa is occasionally 
invaluable to the physician."

DR. EDWARD SMITH, LL.B., 
F.R.S., in his valuable work on 
" Foods," for the International Scientific 
Series, says : — 

" These well-known substances (cocoa 
and chocolate) are valuable foods, since 
they are not only allied to tea and cotfee 
as respiratory excitants, but possess a 
large quantity of fat and other food mate- 
rials. 

" The following is the analysis of the 
cocoa-bean, from various localities, by

" This substance," he goes on to say, 
" in its action is less exciting to the ner- 
vous system than tea or cofiee, and at the 
same time it contains a much larger pro- 
portion of nutritive material. Aloreover, 
its flavor is not lessened by the addition of 
milk, so that it can be boiled in milk only, 
and thus produce a most agreeable and 
nutritious food. There are, therefore, 
many persons, states of system and cir- 
cumstances, in which its use is to be pre- 
ferred to either tea or coffee." 



54 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

A writer in Blackwood's Magazine 
(1854, ^' 75) ^^y^ • " ^^ ^^^ ^^^^ varieties 
of ordinary human food cocoa has the 
closest resemblance to milk ; " and he 
gives the following analyses of dried milk 
and the dried kernel of the cocoa-bean : —

*' These numbers show," he says, " that 
the bean is rich in all the important nutri- 
tious principles which are found to coexist 
in our most valued forms of ordinary food. 
It differs from milk chiefly in the larger 
proportion of fat it contains, and hence it 
cannot be used so largely without admixt- 
ure as the more familiar milk. When 
mixed with water, however, it is more 
properly compared with milk than with 



VALUE AS FOOD. 55 

the infusions of little direct nutritive 
value, like those of tea and coiTee ; and, on 
the other hand, it has the great advantage 
over milk, over beef-tea, and other similar 
beverages, that it contains the substance 
theobromine and the volatile empyrematic 
oil, — both possessed of veiy valuable 
properties. Thus it unites in itself the 
exhilarating and other special qualities 
which distinguish tea, with the strengthen- 
ing and ordinary body-supporting qualities 
of milk." 

Brillat-Savarin, from whose work we 
have already quoted, says ? — 

" Chocolate has given rise to profound 
dissertations, whose object has been to de- 
termine its nature and properties, and to 
place it in the category of hot, cold, or 
temperate foods ; and it must be confessed 
that these learned writings have contributed 
but very slightly to the demonstration of 
the tiuth. 



56 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

" But it was left for those two great mas- 
ters, time and experience, to decide that 
chocolate, carefully prepared, is an article 
of food as wholesome as it is agreeable ; 
that it is nourishing, easy of digestion, and 
does not possess those qualities injurious to 
beauty with which coffee has been re- 
proached ; that it is excellently adapted to 
persons who are obliged to a great concen- 
tration of intellect in the toils of the pulpit 
or the bar, and especially to travellers ; 
that it suits the most feeble stomach ; that 
excellent eflects have been produced by it 
in chronic complaints, and that it is a last 
resource in affections of the pylorus. 

" The various properties are due to the 
fact that, chocolate being, strictly speak- 
ing, only an elasosaccharum (oil of sugar) , 
there are few substances which contain 
in an equal volume more nourishing par- 
ticles, — the consequence being that it is 
almost entirely assimilated. 

" During the war (of the Spanish Sue- 



VALUE AS FOOD. 57 

cession) cocoa was scarce, and very dear. 
It was attempted to find a substitute, but 
all efforts were In vain ; and one of the 
greatest benefits of the peace was the re- 
lieving us of the various brews, whicli it 
was necessary to taste out of politeness, 
but which were no more like chocolate 
than the infusion of chiccory was like 
Mocha coffee. 

" Some persons complain of being unable 
to digest chocolate ; others, on the con- 
trary, pretend that it has not sufficient 
nourishment, and that the efiect disappeai^s 
too soon. It is probable that the former 
have only themselves to blame, and that 
the chocolate which they use is of bad 
quality or badly made ; for good and well- 
made chocolate must suit every stomach 
which retains the slightest digestive power. 

" In regard to the others the remedy is 
an easy one ; they should reenforce their 
breakfast with a pate, a cutlet, or a kid- 
ney ; moisten the whole with a good 



58 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

draught of soconusco chocolate, and thank 
God for a stomach of such superior ac- 
tivity. 

" This gives m 3 an opportunity to make 
an observation whose accuracy may be 
depended upon. 

" After a good, complete and copious 
breakfast, if we take in addition a cup of 
well-made chocolate, digestion will be 
perfectly accomplished in three hours, and 
we may dine whenever we like. Out of 
zeal for science, and by dint of eloquence, 
I have induced many ladies to tiy this 
experiment. They all declared, in the be- 
ginning, that it would kill them ; but they 
have all thriven on it, and have not failed 
to glorify their teacher. 

" The people who make constant use of 
chocolate are the ones who enjoy the 
most steady health, and are the least sub- 
ject to a multitude of little ailments which 
destroy the comfort of life ; their plump- 
ness is also more equal. These are two

advantages which every one may verify 
among his own friends, and wherever the 
practice is in use. 

" Tliis is tlie place to speak of tlie prop- 
erties of chocolate with amber, — properties 
which I have proved with many experi- 
ments, and the results of which I am 
proud to offer to my readers. 

" Let every man, then, who has drunk 
too deep of the cup of pleasure ; every man 
who has spent in work the time which 
should be devoted to sleep ; every man of 
wit who feels himself temporarily growing 
stupid ; every man who finds the air 
damp, the time long, and the atmosphere 
difficult to endure ; every man who is tor- 
mented with a fixed idea which takes 
away from him the liberty of thought, — let 
all these, I say, administer to themselves 
a good half-litre of amber chocolate, in the 
proportion of sixty or seventy grains of 
amber to the pound, and they will see 
wonders. 



60 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

"In my particular way of specifying 
things I call amber chocolate chocolate 
for the a_ffllcted^ because each one of 
these various conditions which I have 
designated has something in common 
which resembles affliction." 

M. Boussingault,^ a inember of the 
French Institute, in an interesting joaper 
printed in the " Annales de Physique et 
du Chi/nic^^' says : — 

" Chocolate contains a very large pro- 
portion of nutritive matter in a small vol- 
ume. In an expedition to a great distance, 
where it is imperatively necessary to re- 
duce the weight of tlie rations, chocolate 
offers undeniable advantages, as I have 
had frequent occasions to notice. Hum- 
boldt recalls what has been said with 
reason, that in Africa rice, gum, and

butter enable men to cross the desert ; and 
he adds that, in the New World, chocolate 
and corn-meal render the plateaus of the 
Andes, and the vast, uninhabited forests, 
accessible to man. 

"In Central America, when they organ- 
ize a river expedition, or traverse the for- 
ests, they prepare chocolate for provision 
with eighty parts of cocoa to twenty of 
coarse sugar, the composition being as fol- 
lows : —

and 6 of albumen. It is a useful addition 
to the ration formed of beef slightly salted 
and dried in the air, of rice, of corn bis- 
cuit, or of cassava muffins. 

" The infusion of tea, mate (Paraguay 
tea) , and coflee are not, of course, to be con- 
sidered as food. The amount of solid 
matter in them is very slight, and their 
eflects are due only to their alkaloids. 

" This is not true of chocolate, v^rhich is 
at the same time complete food and an 
active excitant, since it approaches in com- 
position that model food, milk. In fact 
we have seen that in cocoa there is Icgu- 
mine and albumen, associated with fat, 
sugar to sustain respiratory combustion, 
j^hosphates, which are the basis of the 
bones, and — what milk does not have 
— theobromine and a delicate aroma. 
Roasted, ground and mixed with sugar, 
cocoa becomes chocolate, the nutritive 
properties of which astonished the Spanish 
soldiers that invaded Mexico."

A competent writer, in the last edition of 
the " EncyclopEedia Britannica," says : — 

" The constitution upon which the pecul- 
iar value of cocoa depends is the theobro- 
mine, an alkaloid substance, which till re- 
cently was supposed to be distinct from, 
though closely allied to, the theine of tea and 
coffee. It is now, however, known that the 
alkaloid in these, and in two or three other 
substances similarly used, is identical, and 
their physiological value is consequently 
the same. The fat, or cocoa-butter, is a 
firm, solid white substance, at ordinary 
temperature, having an agreeable taste and 
odor, and very remarkable for its freedom 
from any tendency to become rancid. It 
consists essentially of stearin, with a little 
olein, and is used in surgical practice, and 
in France as a material for soap and 
pomade manufacture. 

"The starch grains present in raw cocoa 
are small in size, and of a character so 
peculiar that there is no difficulty in dis- 



64 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

tinguishing them under the microscope 
from any other starch granules. As an 
article of food cocoa difiers essentially from 
both tea and coffee. While only an in- 
fusion of these substances is used, leaving 
a large proportion of their total weight 
unconsumed, the entii'e substance of the 
cocoa-seeds is prepared as an emulsion for 
drinking, and the whole is thus utilized 
within the S3"stem. While the contents of 
a cup of tea or coffee can thus only be re- 
garded as stimulant in its effect, and almost 
entirely destitute of essential nutritive prop- 
erties, a cup of prepared cocoa is really a 
most nourishing article of diet, as, in addi- 
tion to the value of the theobromine it con- 
tains, it introduces into the systein no incon- 
siderable portion of valuable nitrogenous 
and oleaginous elements." 

M. Arthur jSIangin, in his valuable 
work, " Le Cacao et le Chocolat" pub- 
lished in 1863, gives some very good 



VALUE AS FOOD. 65 

reasons for promoting the use of cocoa. 
He sa^s : — 

" Cocoa cannot be considered in any re- 
spect an article of luxury. It is not a 
dainty ; its hygienic and nutritive prop- 
erties are unquestionable and unquestioned, 
and its being endowed with an aroma and 
flavor wliich please the sense of smell and 
the palate is no reason at all for its not 
being reckoned among articles of food, 
properly so called. Its cultivation, trans- 
port and preparation furnish occupation 
and support to a multitude of laborers, and 
its consumption should be respected and 
encouraged by all wise governments, not 
only because it is physically beneficial, but, 
and we do not hesitate to say it, because 
it is morally salutary. 

" CoiTee, of which much good can hon- 
estly be said, is, hovv^ever, open to much 
criticism, as well on account of its physio- 
logical efiects as its influence on public 
morals. It can be abused and misused. 



66 COCOA AXD CHOCOLATE. 

Its infusion is an exciting beverage, which 
docs not agree with every one, and whicli 
may, when used to excess, cause serious 
consequences, decidedly affect the Iiealtli, 
and even disturb the intellectual faculties. 
Coffee, moreover, easily becomes a pretext 
for debauch. It is consumed in the most 
respectable houses ; but also in cafes^ liquor 
saloons and disreputable places, with the 
accompaniments of alcoholic liquors, to- 
bacco-smoke, coarse words, and unlawful 
games. 

" It is impossible to impute the like effects 
to chocolate. Its use can never degenerate 
into abuse, and it can never, like coffee, 
become a poison, even a slow poison. And 
then, whatever certain casuists may say, 
chocolate is decidedly a food, not a bever- 
age. More, it is, above all, the food of 
^obcTj^ order 1}', and peaceable folk. It is 
found only on the family table, at parties 
of good society, or in public establishments 
frequented either by well-bred people or

hard-working mechanics. We do not phiy 
cards or smoke while we drink chocolate, 
and after it we take no brandy ; we drink, 
perhaps, a glass of cold water, and go 
peaceabl}'- back to our work or to look after 
our affairs. 

" The well-known proverb, ' People are 
known by the company they keep,' would 
lose none of its force if altered to read : 
' Tell me what you eat and drink, and I 
will tell you who you are.' Breakfast, 
especiall}', is the characteristic repast, 
which gives the surest indications as to the 
moralit}- of civilized men. The man who 
eats a substantial meat breakflist, and fol- 
lows it up with coffee and liquors, may 
certainly be a veiy honest inan, but he is 
not a temperate man, and one might wager 
that after such a repast he will do very 
little. Be assured, on the contrary, that 
he who breakfasts on milk, coffee, or choco- 
late has few physical wants ; that his sen- 
suality, if he be sensual, is mild and 



68 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

moderate, and that the man in him has the 
mastery over he animal. Let govern- 
ments load with high duties all spirituous 
liquors, — luxurious beverages for the rich, 
but utter poison for the people, — agents of 
dejDravity, demoralization, and degenera- 
tion, equally fatal to public morals and 
public health ; let them impose an arbi- 
trary tax on tobacco, and even monopolize 
the sale at fictitious prices ; let them do 
likewise with playing-cards and other 
articles which supply merely imaginary 
wants, — these are measures whose political 
legitimacy or economic utility may be at- 
tacked, but which cannot be contested as 
contrary to the popular interest, or to the 
increase of its comfort or its moral im- 
provement. 

" Cocoa is, on the coiitrary, among the 
few articles — it is perhaps the only one 
— whose sale should be not only released 
from all constraint, but encouraged and 
extended, because it is the only article of 



VALUE AS FOOD. 69 

food to which may be applied the appar- 
ently strange and paradoxical qualification 
— mo7-any improving^ food. We have just 
shown that this qualification suits it in all 
respects. It is proved, beside, that cocoa 
enters too largely into pojDular consump- 
tion, that it forms too great an addition to 
the sum of the food substances already ex- 
isting, for it to be reckoned henceforth 
among luxuries subject to sumptuary 
laws." 

Dr. Edmund A. Parkes, F.R.S., in his 
" Manual of Practical Hygiene, prepared 
especially for use in the Medical Sen-ice 
of the Army" (London, 1S64), says: — 

" Although the theobromine of cocoa is 
now known to be identical with theine and 
caffeine, the composition of cocoa removes 
it widely from tea and coffee. The quan- 
tity of fat varies even in the same sort of 
cocoa. The ash contains a large quantity of 
phosphate of potash. The larger quantity 



70 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

of fat makes it a very nourishing article of 
diet, and it is therefore useful in weak 
states of the system, and for healthy men 
imder circumstances of great exertion. It 
has even been compared to milk. In 
South America cocoa and maize cakes are 
used by travellers, and the large amount 
of agreeable nourishment in small bulk 
enables several days' supplies to be easily 
carried. By roasting, the starch is changed 
into dextrin, the amount of margaric acid 
increases, and an empyrematic aromatic 
substance is formed." 

Baron von Liebig, the famous chemist, 
says : — 

" It is a perfect food, as wholesome as 
delicious, a beneficent restorer of exhausted 
power ; but its quality must be good, and 
it must be carefully prepared. It is highly 
nourishing and easily digested, and is fitted 
to repair wasted strength, preserve health, 
and prolong life. It agrees wuth dry tern-

peraments and convalescents ; with moth- 
ei's who nurse their children ; with those 
whose occupations oblige them to undergo 
severe mental strains ; with public speak- 
ers, and with all those who give to work a 
portion of the time needed for sleep. It 
soothes both stomach and brain, and for 
this reason, as well as for others, it is the 
best friend of those engaged in literary 
pursuits." 

Frangois Joseph Victor Broussais, a 
celebrated physician and member of the 
French Institute, says : — 

" Chocolate of good quality, well made, 
properly cooked, is one of the best aliments 
that I have yet found for my patients and 
for myself. This delicious food calms the 
fever, nouiishes adequately the patient, 
and tends to restore him to health. I 
would even add that I attribute many cures 
of chronic dyspepsia to the regular use of 
chocolate." 



72 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, the dis- 
tinguished German phj'sician, says : — 

" I recommend good chocolate to ner- 
vous, excitable persons ; also to the weak, 
debilitated, and infirm ; to children and 
women. I have obtained excellent results 
from it in many cases of chronic diseases 
of the digestive organs." 

Dr. Karl Ernest Bock, of Leipsic, 
author of a " Traite de Pathologic ct de 
Diagnostic " says : — 

" The nervousness and peevishness of 
our times are chiefly attributable to tea 
and cofiee ; the digestive organs of con- 
firmed cofiee-drinkers are in a state of 
chronic derangement, which reacts upon 
the brain, producing fretful and lachry- 
mose moods. Cocoa and chocolate are 
neutral in their physical effects, and are 
really the most harmless of our fashionable 
drinks." 



VALUE AS FOOD. 73 

Jean Baptiste Alphonse Chevalier, iu 
his treatise on chocolate, says : — 

" Cocoa and chocolate are a complete 
food ; coffee and tea are not food. Cocoa 
gives one-third its weight in starch and one- 
half in cocoa-butter ; and, converted into 
chocolate by the addition of sugar, it real- 
izes the idea of a complete aliment, whole- 
some and eminently hygienic. The shells 
of the bean contain the same principles as 
the kernels, and the extract, obtained by 
an infusion of the shells in sweetened milk, 
forms a mixture at once agreeable to the 
taste, and an advantageous substitute for 
tea and coffee." 

Mme. de Sevigne, in one of her letters to 
her daughter, says : — 

"I took chocolate night before last to 
digest my dinner, in order to have a good 
supper. I took some yesterday for nour- 
ishment, so as to be able to fast until night. 
What I consider amusing about chocolate 



74 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

is that it acts according to the wishes 
of the one wlio takes it." 

It will be observed that Brillat-Savaria 
corroborates this statement as to the value 
of chocolate as an aid to digestion. 

" The cocoa-nut," says M. Payen, in 
" Des Substances Al i mentaires " " has in 
its composition more azote than wheat 
flour, about twenty times as much fatty 
matter, a considerable proportion of starch, 
and an agreeable aroma which excites the 
appetite. We are entirely disposed to admit 
that this substance contains a remarkable 
nutritive power. Besides, direct experience 
has proved this to be the case. In fact, 
cocoa, closely combined with an equal or 
two-thirds weight of sugar, forming the 
article well-known under the name of 
chocolate, constitutes a food, substantial 
in all respects, and capable of sustaining 
the strength in travelling." 

And, a little farther on, he adds : — 



VALUE AS FOOD. 7o 

" Cocoa and chocolate, in consequence 
of their elementary composition, and of the 
direct or indirect addition of sugar before 
their consumption, constitute a food, res- 
piratory, or capable of maintaining animal 
heat, by means of the starch, sugar, gum, 
and fatty matter which they contain ; they 
are also articles of food favorable to the 
maintenance or development of the adi2:)ose 
secretions, by reason of the fatty matter 
(cocoa-butter) belonging to them ; and, 
finally, they assist in the maintenance and 
increase of the tissues by means of their 
congeneric azote substances, which assimi- 
late therewith." 

Etienne Fran9ois Geoffroy, the distin- 
guished French physician and professor of 
medicine and pharmacy in the College of 
France, says, in his " Traite de JSIatiere 
jMcdicale " .* — 

" The drinking of chocolate, especially 
of that made with milk, is recommended 



76 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

to persons affected with phthisis or con- 
sumption ; and, in flict, it supphes a juice 
which is nourisliing, substantial, and 
smooth, which deadens the acrimony of the 
humors; provided, as we have said, that the 
cocoa is properly roasted, and mixed with 
a very small quantity of spices." 

The French officer, fi'om whose work on 
the " Natural History of Chocolate " we have 
already quoted, after describing the differ- 
ent methods of raising a:ul curing the fruit 
and preparing it for food (which it is not 
worth while to reproduce here, as the 
methods have essentially changed during 
the last fifty years) , goes on to demonstrate, 
as the result of actual experiment, that 
chocolate is a substance " very temperate, 
very nourishing, and of easy digestion ; 
very proper to repair the exhausted spirits 
and decayed strength ; and very suitable to 
presence the health and prolong the lives 
of old men."

" I could produce several instances," he 
says, " In favor of this excellent nourish- 
ment ; but I shall content myself with two 
only, equally certain and decisive, in proof 
of its goodness. The first is an experiment 
of chocolate's being taken for the only 
nourishment, — made by a surgeon's wife 
of Martinico : she had lost, by a very 
deplorable accident, her lower jaw, which 
reduced her to such a condition that she 
did not know how to subsist. She was 
not capable of taking anything solid, and 
not rich enough to live upon jellies and 
nourishing broths. In t^jis strait she de- 
termined to take three dishes of chocolate, 
prepared after the manner of the country, 
one in the morning, one at noon, and one 
at night. There chocolate is nothing else 
but cocoa kernels dissolved in hot water, 
with sugar, and seasoned with a bit of cin- 
namon. This new way of life succeeded so 
well that she has lived a long while since, 
moi'e lively and robust than before this 
accident. 



78 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

" I had the second relation from a gen- 
tleman of jSIarthiico, and one of my 
friends not capable of a falsity. 

" He assured me that in his neighborhood 
an infant of four months old unfortunately 
lost his nurse, and its parents, not being 
able to put it to another, resolved, through 
necessity to feed it with chocolate. The 
success was very happy, for the infant 
came on to a miracle, and was neither less 
healthy nor less vigorous than those who 
ai'e brought up by the best nurses. 

" Before chocolate was known in Europe 
good old wine was called the milk of old 
men ; but this title is now applied with 
greater reason to chocolate ; since its use 
has become so common that it has been 
perceived that chocolate is, with respect to 
them, what milk is to infants. In realit}^, 
if one examines the nature of chocolate a 
little, with respect to the constitution of 
aged persons, it seem.s as though the one 
v/as made on purpose to remedy the de-

fects of the other, and that it is truly the 
panacea of old age. 

" Our life, as a famous physician obsei"vxs, 
is, as it were, a continual growing dry ; 
but yet this kind of natural consumption is 
imperceptible to an advanced age, when 
the radical moisture is consumed more 
sensibly. The more balmy and volatile 
parts of the blood are dissipated by little 
and little ; the salts, disengaging from the 
sulphurs, manifest themselves ; the acid 
appears, which is the fruitful source of 
chronic diseases. The ligaments, the ten- 
dons, and the cartilages have scarce any of 
the unctuosity left, which rendered them 
so supple and so pliant in youth. The 
skin grows wrinkled as well within as 
without ; in a word, all the solid parts 
grow dry or bony. 

" One may say that nature has formed 
chocolate w^itli every virtue proj^er to 
remedy these inconveniences. 

" The volatile sulphur with which it 



80 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

abounds is proper to supply the place of 
that which the blood loses every day 
through age ; it blunts and sheathes the 
points of the salts, and restores the usual 
softness to the blood, like as spirit of wine, 
united with spirit of salt, makes a soft 
liquor of a violent corrosive. The same 
sulphurous unctuosity at the same time 
spreads itself in the solid parts, and gives 
them, in some sensTe, tlieir natural supple- 
ness. It bestows on the membranes, the 
tendons, the ligaments and the cartilages, a 
kind of oil which renders them smooth and 
flexible. Thus the equilibrium between 
the fluids and solids is, in some measure, 
reestablished ; the wheels and springs 
of our machine mended ; health is pre- 
served and life prolonged. These are not 
the consequences of philosophical reflec- 
tions, but of a thousand experiments which 
mutually confii'm each other ; among a 
great number of which the following alone 
shall suffice : — 



VALUE AS FOOD. 81 

" There lately died at ivlartinico a coun- 
sellor, about a hundred years old, who, for 
thirty years past, lived on nothing but 
chocolate and biscuit. He sometimes, in- 
deed, had a little soup at dinner, but never 
any fish, flesh, or other victuals. lie was, 
nevertheless, so vigorous and nimble that 
at fourscore and five he could get on horse- 
back without stirrups. 

" Chocolate is not only proper to pro- 
long the life of aged people, but also of 
those whose constitution is lean and dry, or 
weak and cacochymical, or who use violent 
exercises, or whose employments oblige 
them to an intense application of mind, 
which makes them very faintish. To all 
these it agrees perfectly well, and becomes 
to them an alteriuGf diet."

VI. 
COCOA-BUTTER. 

"AS the oil (oi- butter) of cocoa is very 
Jr\. anodyne, or an easer of pain, it is 
excellent, taken inwardly, to cure hoarse- 
ness and to blunt the sharpness of the salts 
that irritate the lungs. In using it must be 
melted and mixed with a svifficlent quantity 
of sugar candy and made into lozenges, 
which must be held in the mouth until 
the substance melts quite aw\ay, so that it 
can be sw^allowed gently. Taken season- 
ably the oil is also a wonderful antidote 
against corrosive poisons. 

"It is the best and most natural j^omatum 
for ladies to clear and plump the skin 
when it is dry, rough, or shrivelled, with- 
out making it appear either fat or shining. 
The Spanish women at Mexico use it 



COCOA-BUTTER. 83 

very much, and it is liighly esteemed by 
them. 

" The leaving off the practice of anoint- 
ing the body \vith oil can be attributed to 
nothing else but the ill smell and other disa- 
greeable effects that attended it ; but if oil of 
chocolate was used instead of oil of olives 
those inconveniences would be avoided, 
because it has no smell and dries entirely 
into the skin. Nothing certainly would 
be more advantageous, especially for aged 
persons, than to renew this custom, which 
has been authorized by the experience of 
antiquity. 

" Apothecaries ought to make use of this, 
preferably to all others, as the basis of their 
balsams, because all other oils grow ran- 
cid, and this does not. 

"There is nothing so proper as this to 
keep arms from rusting, because it con- 
tains less water than any other oil made 
use of for that purpose. 

" In the V»"est Indies thev make use of 



84 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

this oil to cure the j^iles. Others use it to 
ease gout pains, applying it hot to the 
part, with a compress dipped in it, which 
they cover with a hot napkin. It may be 
used after the same manner for the rheu- 
matism." 

jSI. Arthur xvlangin says : — ■ 

" When pure and freshly extracted 
cocoa-butter is of a pale yellow color ; its 
consistency is about that of tallow. Its 
odor is faint, but sweet, and its taste pleas- 
ant. When thoroughly purified, and pro- 
tected from heat, air, and dampness, it may 
be pi'esen^ed, without perceptible altera- 
tion, for several years. 

" It is insoluble in water, hardly soluble 
in alcohol, completely soluble in sulphuric 
ether and the essential oil of turpentine. Its 
density is 0.91 . It softens perceptiblj- at 24° 
or 25° (^Centigrade; i.e., 56 or ^"j Fah- 
renheif)., but melts only at 29°, and be- 
comes entirely liquid only "X 35° to 40°. 
It cannot boil without being decomposed. 



COCOA-BUTTER. 85 

It contains, according to M. Boussingault, 
carbon, ."iGo ; hydrogen, .i 19 ; oxygen, .115. 
Cocoa-butter formerly jDlayed a tolerably 
important part in medicine, by reason of 
the numerous properties attributed to it. 
It was called a pectoral, an exj^ectorant, a 
humective, a demulcent, an emollient, a 
refiigerative, etc., etc. It was prescribed 
for persons suffering from or suspected of 
chest diseases, nervous coughs, bronchitis, 
etc., and it was combined with kermes, 
ipecacuanha, etc., to make pills, emulsions, 
opiates, and other remedies. 

" At present it is no longer prescribed for 
internal use ; but pharmacists, as well as 
perfumers, make it the basis of many po- 
mades and ointments, whose use is, we are 
assured, most beneficial, and, at all events, 
most agreeable. Cocoa-butter, pure or 
simply combined with an oil which renders 
it more or less unctuous, is one of the 
smoothest, most fragrant, and, if we may 
be allowed the expression, most savory, 



86 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

pomades which can be used for the hah* or 
skin, and it is astonishing that there should 
be preferred to it so many equivocal com- 
pounds whose exorbitant price is justified 
by not one of the properties claimed for 
them by the puffs of perfumers." 

"This concentrated oil," says M. Del- 
cher, " is the best and most natui'al of all 
the pomades which ladies, who possess a 
too dry skin can use to make it smooth, 
soft, and polished, without any greasy or 
shining appearance, which is produced by 
most of the pomades advertised for the 
purpose. 

" I agree," continues the same author, 
" with the opinion of M. Plisson, who ad- 
vises the use of cocoa-butter pomade for 
women who suffer from acrid eniptions, 
cracked lips, breast, etc. The Spaniards 
of Mexico understand the value of these 
preparations ; but, as in France, this con- 
centrated oil hardens too much, it is neces- 
sary to mix it with the oil of the ben-nut, 



COCOA-BUTTER. 87 

or of sweet almonds. If the ancient cus- 
tom of the Greeks and Romans should be 
revived, of anointing one's self with oil to 
give suppleness to the limbs and to guard 
against rheumatism, the oil of cocoa should 
be chosen for the purpose. 

" Considered as food, and asa medicinal 
substance, cocoa-butter possesses the same 
fundamental jjroperty as other fat. It sup- 
plies to respiration the necessary combus- 
tible elements, and renders it, in conse- 
quence, more easy and active. It may, 
therefore, be administered with advantage 
to persons suffering from affections of the 
chest, and possesses the advantage, in com- 
mon with only a very small number of 
substances of the same kind, that the most 
fastidious and obstinate patient may take it 
for the whole of his life without disgust."

DIFFERENT METHODS OF PREPARING 
DRINKS. 

THERE are many difierent methods 
of preparing cocoa and chocolate for 
drinking. The Mexicans are in the habit 
of preparing it with atole, a kind of pap 
made of maize, which is their most ancient 
and common beverage, and which they 
mix hot, in equal quantities with the choco- 
late dissolved in hot water, and drink di- 
rectly.' They also dissolve the chocolate 

1 " I remember," says Prof. Eaton, " some that was 
brought home from Mexico by the officers of Gen. Zachary 
Taylor's army. The cakes were of half a pound weight, 
or so, and were made of very coarsely pounded cocoa. 



92 RECEIPTS. 

in cold water, stirring itwitli tlie chocolate 
stick, and skim off the frotli into another 
vessel, then put the remaining chocolate 
over the fire with sugar enough to sweeten 
it, and as soon as it boils pour it over the 
froth, and drink it. 

The inhabitants of St. Domingo put 
chocolate into a vessel with a little water, 
and boil it till it is dissolved ; then add the 
necessary water and sugar, let it boil again 
till an unctuous froth is formed, and drink 
it in this state. 

The Indians of New Spain make use of 

They were well sweetened, and contained a large proportion 
of some starchy material. For a drink the chocolate is 
broken into small pieces and placed with water in a red 
earthen pot, an upright cylindrical pot, and heated. When 
tiie chocolate is boiled enough it is stirred violently with a 
sort of dasher, much like that of an old-fashioned churn, 
except that the handle is rolled betiveen the hands rather 
than worked up and down. The chocolate is beaten into a 
foam, which tiie old travellers declared remained so stiff 
after the chocolate was cold that it could be cut up and 
eaten in mouthfuls. This effect must have been due to the 
quantity of starch, or, most likely, fine maize-meal, in the 
drink, rather than to any special skill in milling it." 



RECEIPTS. 93 

cold chocolate in their festivals, prepared 
by milling pure chocolate in cold water, 
skimming off the froth into another vessel, 
then adding sugar to the remaining liquid, 
and pouring it from a great height on 
the froth. This chocolate is exceedingly 
cold. 

Iced chocolate is used in many parts of 
Italy, where it is the custom to cool almost 
all beverages upon snow or ice. 

The Spanish method of making choco- 
late is to mix it so thick that a spoon can 
stand upright in the mixture ; then to 
drink iced water after it by way of dilut- 
ing it. 

Chocolate is usually milled in a tin vessel, 
within which a wheel, somewhat smaller 
in circumference than the vessel, is fixed 
to a stem which j)asses through the lid, 
and, being turned rapidly between the 
palms of the hands, bruises and mixes the 
chocolate with the water. Chocolate should 
be first milled off the fire, then put on and 



94 RECEIPTS. 

left to simmer for some time, after which 
it is milled again till perfectly smooth, and 
free from sediment. Any ladle or stick 
which efiectually mixes the chocolate with 
the water may be substituted for the mill- 
ing stick. Chocolate in jDowder does not 
require milling. Chocolate should never 
be made until wanted, as it is spoiled by 
reheating. Chocolate may be made in an 
iron pot or stewpan, a chocolate-pot, or 
Chocolatiere. — TJie Dessert J3ook. 

Plain Chocolate (i). 
The quantity of chocolate for a certain 
quantity of milk is according to taste. Two 
ounces of chocolate make a good cup of it, 
and rather thick. Break the chocolate in 
pieces, put it in a tin saucejDan with a tea- 
spoonful of water to an ounce of chocolate, 
and set it on a rather slow fire. Stir now 
and then till thoroughly melted. While 
the chocolate is melting set the quantity 
of milk desired in another tin saucepan on 



RECEIPTS. 95 

the fire, and as soon as it rises, and when 
the chocolate is melted as directed above, 
turn the milk into the chocolate little by 
little, beating well at the same time with an 
egg-beater. Keep beating and boiling after 
being mixed, for three or four minutes ; take 
off and serve. If both chocolate and milk 
are good it will be frothy, and no better or 
more nutritious drink can be had. — Pierre 
Blot. 

Plain Chocolate (2). 
Scrape one ounce (one of the small 
squares) of Baker's or any jjlain chocolate, 
fine ; add to this two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, and put into a small saucepan with 
one tablespoonful of hot water ; stir over a 
hot fire for a minute or two, vmtil it is per- 
fectly smooth and glossy ; then stir it all 
into a quart of boiling milk, or half milk 
and half water ; mix thoroughly and serve 
immediately. If the chocolate is desired 
richer take twice as much chocolate, sugar, 
and water. Made in this way chocolate

ticles. If it is allowed to boil after the 
chocolate is added to the milk it becomes 
oily and loses its fine flavor. — Maria Par-

Frothed Chocolate. 
One cup of boiling water ; three pints of 
fresh milk ; three tablespoonfuls of Baker's 
chocolate, grated ; five eggs, the whites 
only beaten light ; two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, powdered for froth. Sweeten the 
chocolate to taste ; heat the milk to scald- 
ing ; wet up the chocolate with the boiling 
water, and when the milk is hot stir this 
into it ; simmer gently ten minutes, stirring 
frequently ; boil up briskly once ; take from 
the fire, sweeten to taste, taking care not to 
make it too sweet, and stir in the whites of 
two eggs, whipped stiff, without sugar ; 
pour into the chocolate-pot or pitcher, 
which should be well heated. Have ready 
in a cream-pitcher the remaining whites, 
whipped up with the powdered sugar ; cover 



RECEIPTS. 97 

the surface of each cup with sweetened 
meringue before distributing to the guests. 
Chocolate or cocoa is a favorite luncheon 
beverage, and many ladies, especially those 
who have spent much time abroad, have 
adopted the French habit of breakfast- 
ing upon rolls and a cup of chocolate. — 
Alarion Harland. 

Milled Chocolate. 

Three heaping tablespoonfuls of grated 
chocolate ; one quart of milk ; wet the 
chocolate with boiling water, scald the 
milk, and stir in the chocolate-paste ; 
simmer ten minutes ; then, if you have no 
regular " muller," j)ut your syllabub-churn 
into the boiling liquid and churn steadily, 
without taking from the fire, until it is a 
yeasty froth ; pour into a chocolate-pitcher 
and serve at once. 

This is esteemed a great delicacy by 
chocolate-lovers, and is easily made. —

place these as formed, out of hand, upon 
small sheets of glazed paper, in rows about 
an inch apart. When you have placed a 
dozen or two on a sheet take it by the ends 
and lift it up and down a few times, letting 
it touch the table each time ; this motion 
will flatten the balls into wafers. When

just the height of the pail or bowl in which 
you propose to mould your blanc-mange, 
and holding it firmly in the middle of this 
while you pour the mixture around it. 
The paper should be well buttered. Lay 
a book or other light weight on the 
cylinder to keep it erect. When the blanc- 
mange is turned out slip out the paper, 
and fill the cavity with whipped cream, 
heaping some about the base. Specks of 
bright jelly enliven this dish if disposed 
tastefully upon the cream. — Marion Har-

Chocolate Syrup for Soda Water. 

Baker's chocolate (plain), four ounces; 
boiling water, four ounces ; water, twenty- 
eight ounces ; sugar, thirty ounces ; extract 
of vanilla, one-half ounce. Cut the choco- 
late into small pieces, then add the boiling 
water, and stir briskly until the mixture 
forms into a thick paste, and assumes a 
smooth and uniform appearance ; then 
slowly add the remainder of the water, 
stirring at the same time, and set aside until 
cold. After cooling thoroughly, a layer of 
solid grease forms over the surfice, which 
is to be carefully removed by skimming. 
After this is completed add the sugar, dis- 
solved by the aid of a gentle heat, and allow 
the whole to come to a boil. Then strain 
and add the extract of vanilla. This forms 
a syrup which is perfect. It possesses the 
pure, rich flavor of the chocolate without 
the unpleasant taste which is obtained if the 
solid fat is not removed. — M. Michaells.

Frequent analyses have been made, under the 
direction of Boards of Health and sanitary asso- 
ciations in our large cities, to determine the 
purity of chocolate and cocoa preparations sold 
in this country', and in every such analysis the 
articles manufactured by 

WALTER BAKER & CO., 

are reported to be entirely pure and free from 
the admixture of deleterious substances. 



BAKER'S PREMIUM No. 1 
CHOCOLATE, 

In i-lb. packages, blue wrapper, yellow label, 

Is the fresh roasted cocoa-beans carefully selected 
and prepared, then moulded into cakes. It is 
the very best preparation of plain chocolate in 
the market for family use. Celebrated for more 
than a century as a nutritive, salutary, and de- 
licious beverage.

BAKER'S VANILLA CHOCOLATE, 

In 1-2 lb. packages, 
Is guaranteed to consist solely of choice cocoa 
and sugar, flavored with pure vanilla beans. 
Particular care is taken in its preparation, and a 
trial will convince one that it is really a delicious 
article for eating or drinking. It is equal to any 
of the imported chocolates. For tourists and 
those who wish a very pleasant article for eating 
dry, and without any preparation, it is the best. 

GERMAN SWEET CHOCOLATE, 

In 1-4 lb. packages, 

Is one of the most popular sweet chocolates 
sold anywhere. It is palatable, nutritious, and 
healthful. It is a great favorite with children, 
and an excellent substitute for much of the con- 
fectionery now offered to the public. 

Beware of Imitations. The Genuine is

BAKER'S PREPARED COCOA, 

In 1-2 pound packages, yellow label, 

Is a perfectly pure and refreshing beverage, pre- 
pared exclusively from selected cocoa. It is safely 
recommended to those who wish a wholesome 
preparation, combining all the properties of the 
cocoa-beans. It has for nearly a century been a 
standard article of consumption. 

BAKER'S CRACKED COCOA, OR 
COCOA NIBS, 

In 1-2 and i lb. packages and 6 and lo lb. bags, 

Is the fresh roasted bean cracked into small pieces. 
It contains no admixture, and presents the full 
flavor of the cocoa-bean in all its natural fragrance 
and purity. When properly prepared it is one 
of the most economical drinks. Dr. Lankester 
says cocoa contains as much flesh-forming matter 
as beef. 



ADVERTISEMENT. 159 

BAKER'S BROMA, 

In 1-2 lb. packages (tin), 

Is a preparation of pure cocoa and other highly 
nutritious substances, pleasantly flavored and 
sweetened. It contains a large proportion of 
theobromine, and possesses powerful restorative 
qualities. Its delicacy of flavor and perfect solu- 
bility have made it a favorite drink among 
thousands. 

The Medical Gazette says: " Broma, an ad- 
mirable preparation, alike agreeable to the well 
and the sick, has acquired a reputation which we 
think it certainly deserves. Hospitals, infirma- 
ries, and households generally, should always 
be provided with it. When gruel, arrow-root, and 
many other things ordinarily resorted to for 
patients are of no utility, broma is sometimes 
relished and assimilates well. ^Medical men of 
all shades of opinion recommend it to their 
patients instead of tea or coffee. 



160 ADVERTISEMENT. 

BAKER'S BREAKFAST COCOA, 

In 1-2 lb. packages (tin), 

Is made from selected cocoa, with the excess of 
butter of cacao removed, and guaranteed to be 
absolutely pure. It is more than three times the 
strength of other cocoas, making an economical, 
excellent, and delicious beverage for breakfast 
or supper, 

Costing less than One Cent a Cup. 

A general favorite with all who have tried it. 
When purchasing be sure that your grocer sup- 
plies you with BAKER'S BREAKFAST 
COCOA, as there are imitations offered at a 
lower price. 

A prominent and experienced New York phy- 
sician says: "Experience from many years* 
practice in the treatment of lung diseases has 
convinced me that, as an article of diet for those 



ADVERTISEMENT. 161 

suffering tuith any form ofcoiisiunption, chocolate 
is far preferable to tea or coffee ; in fact, the two 
last-mentioned articles are injurious in many 
cases, while chocolate, being an aliment and 
analeptic, is particularly serviceable -where diges- 
tion has been impaired by disease. Having 
examined several specimens of chocolate I find 
that Baker's may be conscientiously recom- 
mended to invalids." 

COCOA-BUTTER, 

In 1-4 lb. cakes. 

One-half the weight of the cocoa-beans consists 
of a fat called Cocoa-Butter, from its resemblance 
to ordinai-y butter. It is considered a great value 
as a nutritious, strengthening tonic, being pre- 
ferred to cod-liver oil and other nauseous fats so 
often iised in pulmonary complaints. As a 
soothing application to chapped hands and lips 
and all irritated surfaces Cocoa-Butter has no 
equal, making the skin remarkably soft and

smooth. Many who have used it say they would 
not be Avithout it, it is such a useful article to 
have in every household. 

COCOA-SHELLS, 

In i-lb. packages. 

Cocoa-Shells are the thin outer covering of 
the beans. They have a flavor similar to but 
milder than cocoa. Their very low price places 
them within the reach of all, and as a pleasant 
and healthy drink they are considered superior 
to tea and coffee. 

Packed o»ly in one-pound papers, with our 
label and name on them. 



RACAHOUT DES ARABES, 

In boxes, 6 lbs. each, — 1-2 lb. bottles. 

This celebrated preparation is a most nutri- 
tious substance, and has become indispensable

as an article of diet for children, convalescents, 
ladies, and delicate or aged persons; is com- 
posed of the best nutritive and restoring sub- 
stances, suitable for the most delicate system. 
It is now a favorite breakfast beverage for 
ladies and young fersoiis, to v/hom it gives fresh- 
ness and embonpoint. It has solved the prob- 
lem of medicine, by imparting something which 
is easily digestible, and at the same time free

thus making it especially desirable for nervous 
persons, or those afflicted with weak stomachs.

prepared, and has received the commendation of 
eminent P/iysicians, as being the best article
