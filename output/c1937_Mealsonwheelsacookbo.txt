FOREWORD 



Wholesome food, well prepared, is a basic requirement in 
the lives of all of us, and the needs of the human body do not 
vary in this respect even when we go vacationing. The only 
real difference between appetites at home and "in transit" is 
that appetites on vacation usually are more robust. Appetites 
in trailers are no exception. 

Three meals a day can be well executed with a minimum of 
effort in the snug convenience of a trailer kitchen. Adventuring 
in a trailer opens opportunities for adventuring in new foods, 
to anyone who will explore the possibilities of this vagabond 
existence; and for summer camps and kitchenettes, these 
menus are equally convenient. 

Meals for the trailer need not be drab or uninteresting. 
Fresh food on every roadside stand, wholesome food in cans 
challenge the homemaker to feed her traveling companions 
interesting food, well prepared. Good food which is adequate 
and appetizing need not be elaborate or intricate to prepare. 
It is hoped that the martyr spirit dominating homemakers of 
an earlier day will not reappear in the trailer. Some of the 
same spirit of adventure that prompted the pioneer home- 
maker to feed her family well as she swayed across the conti- 
nent in her covered wagon may still be required of today's 
trailer homemaker. New frontiers are hers without the same 
hardships and hazards. 

Today's trailer homemaker, if she has taken a step in the 
fashionable direction of keeping up with the times, will dom- 
inate her meals not be dominated by them. She will plan 
each day's meals carefully, with the assurance that her family 



is adequately fed. She will reduce their preparation to a mini- 
mum of time and effort, so that most of her day will find her 
free to revel in the day's adventures in carefree, holiday mood. 
MEALS ON WHEELS the recorded experience of authors 
who know trailer cookery from first-hand experience should 
help chart a safe culinary course and add considerable interest 
to trailer travel.

PREPARATION FOR THE TRIP 



A little forethought just before the trailer cook leaves on a 
trip goes a long way toward making her vacation enjoyable. 
Decide, if possible, on the amount of cooking to be done while 
in the trailer. Will three meals be prepared each day? Will 
breakfast and lunch be trailer meals while dinner is eaten 
out? Or will breakfast and dinner be prepared in the trailer 
with a bit picked up along the way for lunch? The plan will 
probably be changed as you go. It should be, as a matter of 
fact, to give both trip and cook variety. Nevertheless, do a 
little planning in advance. Equipping the trailer will be a 
great deal easier if you take your cooking program into con- 
sideration. 



COOKING EQUIPMENT 




One of the first hazards to be overcome by the trailer cook 
is her desire to take too much cooking equipment. It is so 
much easier to empty out the kitchen drawer into the trailer 
drawer; the pan closet into the trailer closet, than to sit down 
and question herself about each piece, "Do I need this? Can 
I use this pan for a roaster as well as a frying pan?" 

The most important point is to take the minimum amount 
of equipment with a place for every bit of it ! Avoid leaving 
equipment around where it can be seen. For example, if you 
want to take your electric roaster, your pressure cooker and 
your waffle iron, do please find a place for them in one of the 
cupboards. Do not let them set out to catch dust. It is difficult 
enough for two or more people to live in small quarters, 
keeping the trailer neat and orderly, without adding inci- 
dentals to the task. 

The following equipment, menus and recipes are planned 
for a family of four, regularly cooking three meals a day. It 
differs from a minimum list of equipment for the home kitchen 
in that the effort has been made to have one utensil serve two 
purposes whenever possible. 

Add or discard according to the family's needs and how 
much cooking is to be done in the trailer. Before including any 
of your electrical equipment, learn about the facilities at 
tourist camps you will be likely to use on your trip. The 
American Automobile Association can give you the necessary 
information.

NEW EQUIPMENT 

Look for new ideas in utensils. There are some now on the 
market with new ones continually being added. Many of them 
are ideal for the trailer, if new equipment has to be purchased. 

There are pans which come two or three to a set, with 
individual covers. They nest together and will fit over one 
burner. 

If an oven is needed, and a portable one not desired, there 
are ovenettes now available which are quite satisfactory. They 
fit over one of the top units on the stove, and bake in the same 
way as an oven. A little practice is needed, however, to learn 
to regulate the heat. 

Recently an aluminum manufacturer of Wooster, Ohio, 
brought out a very useful utensil kit. The price is about nine 
dollars and the kit contains: 

1 percolator 

3 different size saucepans with lids 

2 different size frying pans with lids 

The lid of the largest frying pan fits a large water pail. 

All of the utensils pack compactly into the water pail. 
There are two handles which fit all pans. 

The new self draining saucepans are worth the extra 
pennies they cost. 




TRAILER HOUSEKEEPING 

1. Be sure to buy a first aid kit at the drug store. Do take 
some salve to put on burns. Do not use butter as the salt is 
detrimental to healing. Buy some prepared adhesive bandage. 
A roll of one inch adhesive tape is handy. With it, corks can 
be taped down in bottles or holes closed in milk cans if con- 
densed milk is used. 

2. If possible keep supplies on hand for one meal ahead. 
When cooking vegetables, cook more than are needed. It is 
possible to use them in a different way the following day, 
changing their character entirely. 

3. If stationed in one place for a while, try preparing part of 
the main meal of the day, after breakfast, before the breakfast 
dishes are washed. 

4. For a light lunch prepared by the trailer cook while en 
route, try some of the following: 

If sandwiches are to be part of the menu, make them, wrap 
them in a damp towel, and keep them in the refrigerator. 
It is a good idea to use the vacuum bottle in order to have 
something hot with the sandwiches. Make an extra amount of 
coffee or cocoa at breakfast, or heat some canned soup, and put 
it in the vacuum bottle for lunch. If cold drinks or milk are 
preferred be sure they are in the ice box. 

Vary the lunches, do not have sandwiches continually. Make 
salads from leftovers and put them into waxed containers with 
lids that fit very tightly. Every 5 & 10^ Store carries these. 

Heat beans or chili con carne, etc., at breakfast time and 
keep them hot in the vacuum jug. 

Remember food ceases to be tempting if menus are not varied. 



10 MEALS ON WHEELS 



5. Along with the vacuum jug and bottle buy picnic equip- 
ment at the 5 & ioj Store before you leave. The paper cups, 
forks, spoons, plates and napkins are handy not only for 
picnics but for light lunches or suppers. They will eliminate 
dish washing. 

6. Do not forget to start out with at least one roll of paper 
toweling and some cleansing tissues. They are excellent for 
wiping metal cutlery or dishes, when you do not want to take 
time to wash dishes. Paper toweling is a good laundry saver. 
Get the family in the habit of using it. 

7. Stock your emergency shelves wisely and with thought. 
Space is limited, make the most of it. If very little cooking is to 
be done en route, have a few snacks such as crackers, cheese, 
olives, and canned sandwich spreads. 

8. With very little effort one can leave home with a full 
trailer larder. Several tins of cookies they keep indefinitely, 
some homemade jellies, jams, or any other home canned 
foods are excellent to have tucked away. The trailer cook might 
even bake a pie or cake, and have a small baked ham and 
roast chicken in the refrigerator. 

9. In the evening, before retiring, fill the tea kettle and 
other utensils with enough water for washing and breakfast, 
if >u do not use your storage tank. If you do, see that it is 
fined before retiring. 

10. Use spring hooks to hold teacups. This allows more 
space in the china cupboard. The cups are held tightly so that 
there is no danger of their breaking while traveling. 

1 1 . If Beetle Ware is used instead of china dishes, get a good 
quality. It will not crack so quickly. 

12. If much cooking is done have a small emergency shelf 
in the refrigerator, for such things as pastry dough, cookie 
dough, sandwich fillings, etc. 



1 TRAILER HOUSEKEEPING 1 1 

Try to keep china dishes out of the refrigerator. Use waxed pa- 
per sandwich bags for leftovers that do not have liquor. It will pay 
to buy ovenware refrigerator dishes and use them for baking 
or the refrigerator. Foods should be kept covered in the re- 
frigerator to keep them from drying out and absorbing odors 
from each other. A small vegetable dish or pan with a cover 
will not only save space in the refrigerator but will keep lettuce, 
celery and other vegetables crisp. Try one. The 5 & 10^ Store 
has oiled cloth bags that are also convenient for use in the 
refrigerator. 

13. Include a kitchen pad and pencil. It is indispensable 
for market orders, to jot down staples as they give out, and 
numerous other memos. 

14. While preparing a meal, try to clean up as you go. It is 
much more pleasant to eat in well ordered surroundings. 

15. If aluminum cooking utensils are used, get the steel 
wool which has soap in it, as it is easier to clean utensils with 
it. 

1 6. Beware of too many fried foods. They are easy and 
quick, but baked and broiled foods are preferable. Plan 
picnics where the family can bake or broil foods outdoors, and 
thus be kind to their digestions. 

17. If the vacation trip is to be spent in the mountains, 
remember that boiling food at high altitudes is a long, slow 
process. A small aluminum pressure cooker is excellent. It 
will cook meals in about one half the usual time. Plan one-dish 
dinners, such as stews. Local newspapers in the territory can 
often supply recipes to vary the menus. 

1 8. Wire baskets in different sizes may be purchased at the 
5 & i o Store to hold condiments, flour in a bag, vegetables, 
etc. Hooks may be screwed into the sides of the cupboard and 
the wire baskets slipped over them to prevent the baskets from 
rattling. 



12 MEALS ON WHEELS 



19. Any hanging equipment can be held down by a piece 
of elastic. Sew a brass ring on each end of an elastic, slip over 
the utensil and hook on brass hooks that you screw in the 
wall on either side of the utensil in question. 

20. Save on water. Keep a filled water bottle in the re- 
frigerator for drinking. If you use your water tank, do so as 
an emergency measure. Follow suggestion No. 9. Remember to 
flush the tank thoroughly several times a week to keep it 
clean. 

21. One of the simplest ways to serve meals out of doors 
is to set up individual trays. The 5 & 10^ Store has large, 
attractive, rectangular tin ones, that are quite satisfactory. 
The meal, hot or cold, can be dished up and quickly placed 
on the trays, with cutlery, napkin and glass of water or 
beverage, and eaten out of doors.

OVEN TEMPERATURE TESTS 

The most successful baking results are obtained with a 
thermostat or regulator-controlled oven. If there is not such a 
device on the oven, it helps to have an oven thermometer. But 
be sure it is a good one. If an oven thermometer is not avail- 
able, try the following tests, although they are unreliable. 
They need much practice to prove dependable, but in a pinch, 
they are better than guessing. 

When the oven is heated, lay a piece of white paper on its 
lower shelf and close the oven door. Varying kinds of paper 
brown to different degrees in the same length of time, there- 
fore tests cannot be accurate. However, 

1. If the paper becomes light brown in five minutes, it is 

a slow oven (250 to 350 F.). 

2. If the paper becomes medium brown in five minutes, it 

is a moderate oven (350 to 400 F.). 

3. If the paper becomes dark brown in five minutes, it is 

a hot oven (400 to 500 F.). 





THE EMERGENCY SHELF 

OR 
PREPARING FOR THE UNEXPECTED 



Every trailer should have one or two shelves stocked with 
canned goods. Give the emergency food supply careful thought 
and consideration before the trailer leaves home. It will take 
care of many a cooking crisis on the road. 

The trailer cook will find that an efficiently worked out 
emergency supply may be depended on for many a delectable 
impromptu meal, en route. It will serve unexpected guests 
and will come to her rescue when no store is in sight. 

It is helpful to know sizes of cans, net contents and number 
of servings in each size. Following is a chart issued by the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture on canned fruits and 
vegetables:

The smallest sizes, Nos. X, >^ and ^, contain, generally, 
such foods as devilled meats, sardines, etc. There are also 
fruits and vegetables in No. > (8- or g-ounce cans, depending 
on the canner) which are excellent when there are only two 
in the family, or when combinations such as fruit salads, or 
other small quantities are needed. Most vegetables and berries 
are packed in No. 2 cans, while fruits are packed in No. a^- 
However, nearly all fruits and vegetables are packed in 
the No. i size as well. So it is wise to learn can sizes, and have 
those sizes on hand that will best take care of the family. 

The most important points to remember when buying for 
an emergency shelf are: 

1 . Do not overstock, and 

2. Have food combinations that go well together. 

Space is valuable in a trailer. It is most important to think 
twice about everything taken along, food as well as clothing. 

It saves time to keep your cans arranged in a definite order. 
Either group all those cans together, that will go to make a 
pleasant meal, or group desserts together, main dishes to- 
gether, vegetables together, etc. 

It is a good idea to write out a few favorite menus, making 
use of the canned goods on hand, and paste the menus on the 
door of the emergency shelf closet. This may sound like going 



1 8 MEALS ON WHEELS 



to a lot of trouble, but it will reap its reward, you may be sure. 

Try to think up new menus from time to time and keep 
changing the emergency list. When marketing, keep an eye 
out for new canned products. 

Keep materials fresh by using them up regularly, but be 
sure you replace whatever you use, at the earliest opportunity. 

Every trailer family's needs and space are individual, but 
here are some general hints for trailer cooks: 

1 . One or more soups 

2. One or more meats or fish for main dishes 

3. One or more vegetables 

4. Some materials for salads 

5. A small jar of mayonnaise 

6. A few desserts and flavored gelatin preparations 

7. Several sandwich spreads 

8. A tin or package of cookies 

9. Relishes, such as olives and pickles 

10. One or more cans of fruit juice 

1 1 . A can of evaporated milk 

12. A can of condensed sweetened milk 

13. One or more prepared flour mixtures 

14. Jellies and jams

WHITE SAUCES 23 



WHITE SAUCES 

One of the tests by which you know a good cook is the 
excellence of the white sauces she can make. A white sauce 
should be smooth, creamy and fine in flavor. 

Thin Sauce Used in making cream soups. 

Medium Sauce Used for creamed or escalloped dishes, 
gravies; consistency as of heavy cream. 

Thick Sauce Also used for creamed or escalloped dishes, 
gravies, croquettes, souffles; a heavy sauce that spreads rather 
than runs. 



Liquid 
Flour or 
Cornstarch 
Fat 


For Thin Sauce 
1 cup 
1 tablespoon 
1 teaspoon 
1 tablespoon 


For Medium Sauce 
1 cup 
2 to 3 tablespoons 
2 teaspoons 
1 to 3 tablespoons 


For Thick Sauce 
1 cup 
3 to 4 tablespoons 
1 tablespoon 
1 to 4 tablespoons 



Method of Mixing Ingredients: 

The most usual method for making a white sauce is to melt 
fat, stir in flour and add all of milk, water or stock. Stir con- 
stantly while cooking and season to taste. A brown sauce is 
one in which fat and flour are both browned, or just one of 
these is browned before the liquid is added. This kind of sauce 
is used for gravies. Cream is used for the liquid in a cream 
sauce. 

If cornstarch is used as a thickening agent, the mixture 
should be cooked longer than a flour mixture, to overcome the 
raw taste.

TRAILER MENUS 

The most difficult meal to plan when traveling in a trailer is 
the big meal of the day. Breakfast and lunch are simple, but 
when it comes to dinner or supper, whichever is the main meal, 
the trailer homemaker is apt to be a bit perplexed. 

Because there is so little room to work in; because there is a 
minimum amount of equipment; because it is impossible to 
store foods in large quantities, and, most important of all, be- 
cause there is a justifiable apathy toward spending much time 
in food preparation trailer cooking must be simple. Far 
simpler than cooking at home ! 

The following menus and recipes have been worked out 
with these facts in mind. The menus might be classified as 
suitable for luncheons or suppers, but by adding an appetizer 
or soup, and another vegetable, they may be turned into large 
dinners, if the trailer homemaker is ambitious. 

The most difficult part of meal planning at home, or in a 
trailer, is the proper combination of entree or main dish, 
salad and dessert. The variety of foodstuffs is apt to be limited 
while en route, and this is where the canned goods on the 
emergency shelf may be most useful. But, whenever possible, use 
fresh fruits and vegetables. 

A large assortment of recipes are presented here in an effort 
to take the monotony out of trailer meals. It is all too easy to 
drift into preparing dull and uninteresting meals, because it is 
often impossible to buy any but the commonest fruits and 
vegetables while traveling sometimes not even these. It 
depends, of course, on what section of the country you are 
going through. 

The menus are arranged in two sections: For warm and cool 
weather. 



38 MEALS ON WHEELS 



While en route, exercise is likely to be very mild and, if the 
weather is warm, the result is muscular relaxation. This de- 
creases the energy requirement. Hence the so-called warm 
weather suggestions. The meals are lighter, and easier to digest. 

Energy requirements are correspondingly higher in cool 
weather, and after muscular activity appetites are better. 
Therefore, the cool weather suggestions make use of heavier 
foods. 

The warm and cool weather menus have, in turn, been 
divided into two groups. 

The first group in each division is simpler, and can be pre- 
pared more quickly than the second group. The trailer traveler 
who is vacationing for several months will enjoy these menus. 

The second group of menus in each division is a little more 
elaborate, although still easy to prepare. The half million 
homemakers who live in trailers all year round will welcome 
these suggestions, we are sure, and the temporary traveler will 
enjoy them, too. 

Whether a meal is prepared in a trailer or in your own 
kitchen at home, it must be a good meal good to look at, 
good to eat and good for its food value. A few basic rules that 
will smooth out major trailer difficulties are: 

1. In trailer meal planning try to keep one meal ahead 
while en route. Even if the schedule is not rigidly followed, and 
you find yourselves eating at a wayside inn instead of as 
planned, nothing is lost. It is even better to plan meals ahead 
for a whole day or for several days. This is easily done when 
you are camped for a while. It may sound like work, but per- 
severe better meals with more variety will result. 

2. As you travel along, buy fresh fruits and vegetables from 
roadside stands or farmers. They'll be cheaper and the food 
will be fresher. 



TRAILER MENUS 39 



3. Avoid serving the same food twice in one day. Staples 
are not included, of course. With limited storage space in a 
trailer, an exception to this rule is permissible sometimes. For 
example, you might run into a peach or strawberry section en 
route and buy a large quantity. Do the best you can with dis- 
guises, in this case, and hope there will be no complaints. 

4. Avoid flavor repetition. For instance, do not serve celery 
soup and stewed celery or tomatoes and sliced tomato salad 
in the same meal. 

5. Have contrasts in flavor within the course, or in the meal, 
as asparagus which is mild flavored with roast beef. 

6. Have contrasts in texture, as crackers with soup or crisp 
cookies with chocolate pudding. It's the old story of lamb with 
mint jelly, apples with pork applied throughout the meal. 

7. Oppose foods difficult to digest with easily digestible 
ones. Not more than a single food that is a problem to the 
digestive tract should be included in a meal. 

Trailer cooking is full of temptations that lead to badly 
balanced meals. It is easy to drift into concocting meals with 
too many fried foods, starches and foods out of cans. Always 
keep in mind that every day's meals must be well balanced. 
You must include plenty of fresh milk, either to drink or in 
food; plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits, cooked and un- 
cooked, and proteins as in meat or eggs. It is not necessary to 
have meat every day, if you use substitutes such as eggs and 
cheese dishes. A safe guide is color: if a meal has plenty of 
diversified natural color, it is usually well balanced. 

The menu suggestions that follow will help the trailer cook 
work out simple combinations of her own and her family's 
favorites. The recipes immediately follow the menu. 

When cakes, cookies, gelatin desserts or salads are used, it is 
advisable to prepare them either the night before, just before 



4O MEALS ON WHEELS 



the dinner dishes are washed, or the same day before the break- 
fast dishes are washed this, so that all soiled equipment 
may be cleaned at the same time. This method is only practi- 
cable if you camp in one spot for several days. 

The recipes given serve four people. 

Standard measuring cups and spoons have been used. 

It is assumed the trailer cook has a two-burner stove with an 
oven connected to it, or that there is a portable oven.

PICNICS 

What opportunities for outdoor picnics the family has when 
traveling in a trailer ! Instead of eating in the trailer the usual 
way, why not set up a card table outside? Dish up the dinner 
inside, and let each one carry his filled plate to the table. 

As noon approaches, while en route, you may spot a shady 
grove by a brook, the very place to have the sandwiches and 
soup that was heated in the morning and poured into a vacuum 
bottle to keep hot. 

Maybe the picnic is an especially planned one, with every- 
thing prepared in the trailer before leaving. Or maybe it is a 
picnic with part to be cooked on the picnic spot. Whichever it 
is, and wherever it is eaten, the fun is in the eating. So serve 
tempting food combinations, neatly prepared. You'll be sure 
to have a success on your hands. 

Before leaving home, do not forget to put the vacuum jug 
and bottle and any other pet picnic things into the trailer. 
They will be worth the space they take up. 

First, decide what kind of picnic you are going to have. 

Second, plan the menu and assemble equipment before pre- 
paring the food. Doing so enables you, while getting the food 
together, to think about necessities to check and recheck. 
What a letdown on a picnic to find you've left the salt behind ! 

In the section that follows, there are recipes aud instruc-

If the ice cream is very hard, wrap carefully in many sheets 
of newspaper and it will keep until ready to serve. If the carton 
is wrapped in this way, then placed in a deep tin with chopped 
ice packed around it, it will keep solid for a fairly long trip. 
Ice cream in cones makes dishes and spoons unnecessary.

desired, blend one third cup mayonnaise with one cup whipped 
cream. Pack the dressing in a jar with a screw top, and put on 
fruits just before serving. Fresh fruits make a tastier salad. 
They may be prepared in the trailer and packed into a jar 
with a screw top.

* BAKED HAM 

The ham may be sliced or taken whole to the picnic. If 
whole, be sure to take along a sharp knife and bread board. 

* VEGETABLE SALAD 

The vegetable salad may be made up of a variety of g-ounce 
cans of vegetables. Add a minced onion. Leftover fresh cooked 
vegetables, blended with raw ones also make a delicious com- 
bination. If French dressing is used, take the salad in a covered 
bowl or dish, and the dressing in a corked bottle. Marinate the 
salad just before using. 






* FRUIT PUNCH 

The fruit punch may easily be made from many combina- 
tions of canned fruit juices. Delicious combinations are: orange, 
apricot and pineapple; loganberry with gingerale; pineapple 
and grapefruit. If ice is added to the vacuum jug do not dilute 
the juices. If fruit juice is thoroughly chilled, use one of the 
opened cans as a measure and dilute juice with ice water until 
it has the right consistency.

vidual plates and arrange strawberries around the mound of 
sugar. They are eaten by taking hold of the stem and dipping 
the pointed end of the berry into the sugar mound.

Cook mush at home from forty to sixty minutes. Turn into 
a greased loaf pan to harden. It may be taken to the picnic 
in the pan, turned out on a bread board and sliced. Brown 
in fat in a frying pan. Serve with maple syrup. 

Do not take extra fat along. Partially fry the bacon in the 
frying pan. Use this to brown the mush in. Put bacon back 
into frying pan for a few seconds to finish crisping after all 
the mush has been prepared. 

* RASPBERRIES AND CREAM 

If possible purchase waxed cups that are used for salads. 
These are fine for serving the raspberries in. Do not forget to 
take sugar for the berries. 

* ICED COFFEE 

It is advisable to take along chopped ice, well wrapped in 
newspaper or in the vacuum jug. If cubes are obtainable, 
leave in the trays and wrap paper around them. Make very 
strong coffee. Thoroughly chill and mix at the picnic with 
the ice. Putting the coffee and the ice into the vacuum will 
dilute the coffee too much, and it is not tasty if weak. Do not 
forget the cream and sugar.

on the skewer: bacon, drained oyster, bacon, ending and 
beginning with a piece of bacon. Usually for one sandwich, 
three large oysters and four pieces of bacon are sufficient. 
Put small cube of peeled raw potato on pointed end to keep 
oysters and bacon on the skewer. Cook until bacon is well 
broiled, and edges of oysters curled. Place on buttered slice 
of bread, remove potato cube, carefully pull skewer out. Sea- 
son and pour lemon juice over oysters. Place slice of buttered 
bread on top. 

* CAMP FRIED POTATOES 

Boil potatoes with skins on before leaving. Peel and slice at 
the picnic grounds. Put fat into a heavy frying pan. When bub- 
bling, add potatoes and cook until they are golden brown, 
turning them occasionally. Season well. It is a good idea to 
have a cover for the frying pan.

* PEACH SHORTCAKES 

Buy individual "Sally Ann" sponge cakes. Take peaches, 
allowing one large or two small ones for each serving. Peel 
and slice at the picnic and mix well with powdered sugar. 
Put a large spoonful into the hollow part of each sponge cake. 
Either whip cream for the top garnish and put into a covered 
jar or take along a bottle of cream to serve with the shortcakes. 






PICNIC SANDWICHES 

Making Sandwiches 

The crusts, as a rule, remain on the bread for picnic or 
lunch-box sandwiches. The bread should be cut fairly thin 
not over one half inch. If the crusts are removed the sandwich 
is daintier and easier to eat. 

If the crusts are left on the bread, it is better to use pieces 
that follow each other on the loaf for each sandwich. To do 
this, cut the needed slices and allow them to fall in order. 

The butter should be thoroughly creamed, to spread more 
easily and more evenly over the bread. The butter should be 
spread to the very edge of each slice of bread, but not allowed 
to go over the edges and give an untidy look to the sandwich. 
Use a small spatula or table knife to spread filling and butter 
on the bread. 

Both slices of the bread should be buttered. Spread the rill- 
ing on only one buttered slice of the sandwich. 

Keeping the Sandwiches 

Each sandwich is kept better if wrapped individually in 
waxed paper. Waxed paper sandwich bags may be purchased 
inexpensively. It is now possible to buy waxed paper with 
attractive designs stamped on it, and sandwiches wrapped 
in such paper are quite gay. 

Sandwiches will keep moist and fresh if wrapped in a damp 
tea towel and placed in the refrigerator until used. The towel 
should not be allowed to become completely dry. 

To keep sandwiches fresh on a picnic, wrap individually, 
as suggested, and place them in a box with a tight fitting lid. 
First line the box with waxed paper or a damp towel or napkin. 
If three kinds are wrapped in each packet, or as many as there 
are varieties, it will save confusion and additional handing 
about at the picnic.

CANDIES

CANDIES 

The cooked candies, for which recipes and directions are 
given in this chapter, are easily prepared and always prove 
popular. Several uncooked candy recipes are included as well.j 
These can be prepared even more quickly than the cooked 
candies. 

If children are traveling in the trailer, the uncooked recipes 
may be turned over to them. Preparing these candies needs 
little if any supervision. 

One of the most important points in candy making is to 
know the exact time for removing the candy from the fire. 
When you make chocolate fudge expecting a soft, creamy 
candy, it is disappointing to find it hard and grainy instead. 

Proper testing while the sugar and liquid are cooking will 
do much to assure successful results. A candy thermometer is 
the most accurate means of measuring candy temperature 
while cooking, but trailer cooks will find the simple cold water 
tests very satisfactory. 






148 MEALS ON WHEELS 



Use fresh cold water each time the syrup mixture is tested 
and your test will be more accurate. Remove mixture from 
the fire while you are testing, to avoid overcooking. 

Soft-Ball Stage Drop a little hot syrup into very cold 
water. It should form a soft ball in the water, but lose its 
shape when removed from the water. This test is used for 
fudge, fondant and some boiled frostings. 

Hard-Ball Stage Drop a little hot syrup into very cold 
water. It should form a hard ball and retain its shape out of 
the water. This test is used for taffy and caramels. 

Soft-Crack Stage Drop a little hot syrup in very cold water. 
It should form threads which are brittle under water and stick 
to the teeth when chewed. This test is used for toffee, butter- 
scotch and candies to be pulled. 

Hard-Crack Stage Drop a little syrup into very cold water. 
It should form threads which when chewed are brittle and 
do not stick to the teeth. This test is used for brittle candies.

are evenly coated. Shape into balls, and lay on waxed paper. 
Roll each ball in waxed paper and keep in a covered container, 
if desired. 



CANDIES 149 



MOLASSES TAFFY 

Use the above ingredients (except the popped corn) and 
follow the foregoing recipe with the difference of cooking 
the candy to the hard-ball stage. Also add four tablespoons 
of butter when soda is added. Pour into a greased platter 
and when cool enough to handle, pull. Do not use the whole 
hand the fingers and thumbs will do the work. Dip finger 
tips into cornstarch if candy has a tendency to stick. Stretch 
taffy out. Never twist as this excludes the air, and the air makes 
a more porous candy. When the candy is a shiny tan color, 
pull out into a long rope. Cut with scissors into small pieces.

FISH 
Quantity Per Person 

One should allow at least a solid third of a pound per per- 
son. If the portions are estimated from a whole fish, allow 
one half of a pound for each one. 

To Scale a Fish 

Many fish do not have scales. Scales, if present, should be 
removed before any of the cutting is done. Use a dull knife, 
as a sharp one may cut through the skin. Start from the tail 
and draw the knife toward the head. Slant knife toward the 
body of the fish at about a 45 angle. After the scales are re- 
moved, clean the fish. 

How to Clean a Fish 

Cleaning fish is often the most tedious and bothersome proc- 
ess, as many a good fisherman will tell you. If this is the case 
with you, the following directions may simplify the process: 

Grasp the fish's head with the left hand. (Reverse if you are 
left handed.) Gut through the skin from the top of the head 
around under the pectoral fin (the one close to the gills) to 



152 MEALS ON WHEELS 



the stomach. Do this on both sides, then run the knife fairly 
deep from the head to the tail on both sides of the dorsal fin 
(the fin which runs along the back). Both the dorsal and 
adipose (the fatty fin toward the back) may easily be pulled 

out. Gut stomach from head to tail. The skin is left on in 

. 

most cases, but if the fish is to be skinned, start at the top to- 
ward the head, take hold of the skin and snap it off with a 
quick pull. Lay the fish on its side with its back toward you. 
Sever the backbone and upper part of the head with the 
entrails attached to it. Cut off the tail, wash the fish, and it 
is ready to fry. 

Temperatures and Length of Time for Cooking Fish

To Garnish a Fish 

The usual garnishes for fish are parsley, watercress, lemon 
slices, paprika, chopped parsley or watercress, radishes, to- 
matoes, sliced egg, and sliced cucumbers. 



FISH 153 

To Boil a Fish 

There is a prepared paper on the market which makes boil- 
ing a fish quite simple. The fish is cleaned, salted and wrapped 
in the paper, which is then tied. After being wrapped the 
fish should be dropped into hot water which may quickly be 
brought to the boiling point. After the water boils, reduce 
heat and simmer slowly until tender. 

Use just enough water to cover the fish. A tablespoon of 
vinegar or lemon juice may be added to every two quarts of 
water to whiten and harden fish.

To Broil a Fish 

Fortunate are those who have one of the new trailers with an 
oven for broiling. However, broiled fish on a picnic, out in 
the open, is delicious. Remember when broiling a fish to have 
the wires of the picnic broiler or oven broiler well greased so 
that the fish will not stick to them. Broil one side of the fish, 
then turn and broil the other side until light brown.

MODERN AGE BOOKS 



IT would cost several thousand dollars to publish a single book. 
When the cost is spread over two or three thousand books, as is 
usually the case, the cost per book is reduced, but still remains high 
enough to put it beyond the reach of the average reader. 

To overcome this difficulty, Modern Age Books are printed in edi- 
tions of fifty to a hundred thousand copies, which so reduces the 
cost per book that it is possible to sell them at a price well adapted 
to the average pocketbook. 

Modern Age Books are being published at regular intervals. They 
are full-length books, by the best modern authors. They cover the 
entire field of current literature from popular fiction to serious 
studies of political, social, and economic problems. In addition to 
new books, Modern Age is re-issuing a series of unabridged editions 
of the literary treasures of the present and the past. 

For the purpose of convenient identification, all Modern Age Books 
are issued in three classifications: 1. Blue Seal Books; 2. Gold Seal 
Books; 3. Red Seal Books. All new books published for sale at 25f$ 
carry the Blue Seal label; all new books priced above 25 carry the 
Gold Seal label; all re-issues of standard literary works carry the 
Red Seal label. 

All books published in these three classifications at these low prices 
are bound in sturdy paper covers. For those who wish to have 
Modern Age Books in a more durable form, a limited number of 
both Blue and Gold Seal titles are available, attractively bound in 
cloth.

LOU TEMPLE WILLSON 

has traveled most of her life. She was born 
in Nova Scotia, and visited most of Canada 
and the United States as a child, for her par- 
ents were Salvation Army evangelists and 
were sent touring across the continent. After 
her marriage, Mrs. Willson traveled in 
Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, China, India, 
Egypt and Europe, and has frequently added 
to her gypsy-like experience by living in a 
trailer. (Her husband is a trailer manufac- 
turer.) Meals on Wheels is a direct result of 
her travel and food experience. 

OLIVE HOOVER 

is a former teacher of home economics and 
dietetics, an authority on food and its prepa- 
ration, and has also known the problems 
and pleasures of living on wheels. On her 
expert knowledge of balanced diets and her 
innate good sense and practical experience, 
trailer homemakers may rely for the best 
possible guidance.
