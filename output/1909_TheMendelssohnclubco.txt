TO OUR BELOVED 
PRESIDENT, 

MRS. CHANDLER STARR, 

Pre-eminently a natural leader and master of details, 

to whose keen instinct and constructive ability 

we are so greatly indebted, 

and whose genius and faith have constantly 

instilled in us the 

vital principal of success, 

this book is affectionately dedicated. 

Mendelssohn Club Committee. 



We know that things quite pretty- 
are most pleasing to the eye; 

That sweet, harmonious music 

calms the soul's great eager cry; 

But we also know the longing 

that the stomach often feels, 

'Tis then you'll find quite charming 
what our useful book reveals. 

— Nan Lakin. 



THE PRELUDE. 

"In every work, regard the writer's end 
Since none can compass more than they intend, 
And if the means be just, the conduct true. 
Applause, in spite of trivial fault, is due." 

— Pope. 



There is still in existence a tradition, well grounded but not 
well founded, to the effect that the artistic temperament and the 
domestic sciences have but little in common; that they blend about 
as harmoniously as the proverbial oil and water. Just who is re- 
sponsible for its origin is not known, but undoubtedly it comes 
down to us from the dark ages, as one who had any light on the 
subject could never have been so blinded to the truth. However, 
truth and tradition often meet as strangers. 

That a musician may also be an accomplished cook, is demon- 
strated every clay. And why not? Are not both accomplishments 
classified under that much abused name of Art? True, one may be 
"art for art's sake" and the other, art for the stomach's sake; but, 
nevertheless, both are found in the same category. And one famil- 
iar with art in any of its branches is already partially equipped to 
understand its many phases. For example, harmony is a basic 
principal in music, pursued with never ceasing vigilance, and what 
is more important in household economics than harmony, even in 
the culinary department? 

This argument is not intended as a vindication, for the posi- 
tion taken does not require that. It is merely for the enlighten- 
ment of any who hitherto may have sat in darkness. A word to 
the scoffer is sufficient. 



Richard Strauss, in his tone-poem, the "Domestic Symphony", 
has shown us that even the greatest of modern composers is thor- 
oughly conversant with the smallest details of housekeeping, and 
is able to reproduce all the musical sounds so dear to the house- 
wife's ear, from the crying of the baby to the fall of the favorite 
bric-a-brac. And how often is that great artist, Ernestine Schu- 
mann-Heink, whom we are proud to claim as an American citizen 
and who has so generously contributed to this little volume, quoted 
as an illustration of the model housewife and mother. 

Other examples might be quoted, ad infinitum, but it is un- 
necessary when we have constantly before us the Mendelssohn 
Club, among whose prominent members are culinary artists of ac- 
knowledged worth and unrivaled genius. Allow me to say here, 
for the benefit of the unitiated, that it is an erroneous idea to sup- 
pose that conversation at the club's "social sessions" is devoted 
to musical matters. On the contrary, that subject is usuall}'- ta- 
booed in favor of the latest discovery in domestic science, while 
those who have not yet assumed household cares listen in wide- 
ej^ed wonder to learned dissertations by the older and wiser mem- 
bers, on such vital topics as "In What Time Should an Egg be 
Beaten," "How Many Bars Should be Used of Laundry Soap," 
"In What Key Should the Tea-Kettle Sing to Denote the Boiling 
Point" and "What Should be the Composition of an Angel-food 
Cake to Make it a Perfect Symphony?" 

It was at one of these social sessions that the subject of pro- 
viding furnishings for the new Mendelssohn Hall was introduced 
for discussion. Funds were needed, and it was the wish of the club 
to provide the necessary amount without drawing upon the emer- 
gency fund. The suggestion came "Why not publish a cook-book?" 
Instantly two score voices echoed, "Cook-book," and the die was 
cast. The suggestion had struck a responsive chord. 

For months the active members of the club, individually and 
collectively, have worked to make this new venture a success and 
to sustain the reputation they hold in every field they have entered, 
of giving always the best. That home duties and the practical side 
of life have not been lost sight of nor neglected in the quest of the 
most beautiful of all the arts, is proven by the issuance of this 
little volume. From cover to cover, its pages will be found brim- 
ming over with invaluable information for the home-maker. 

With its customary broad-mindedness, the club has recog- 
nized the fact that there are other famous cooks, and many have 



generously responded to the invitation to contribute something 
from their choicest store. To those who have assisted in making 
the Mendelssohn Club Cook-Book one of the best ever issued, the 
club here expresses its grateful appreciation. 

With the publishing of this book, the club celebrates its silver 
anniversary. For a quarter of a century it has endeavored to stand 
for all that is highest and best in music, and year after year there 
has been a constant growth, always onward and upward. With 
pardonable pride we place this work before the public, our first 
effort to prove that the pursuit of music is not all-absorbing, but 
all-embracing; that, as Goethe has expressed it, "Level roads run 
out from music to every side;" and that its possession fits one not 
only to adorn the concert stage and the drawing room, but to shine 
with added lustre in the home, as the light that never fails. 

— Ethel Van Wie.

BREAD. 



CHAPTER I. 

BREAD. 

It is truly said, bread is the staff of life. There is hardly any 
food which is so universally used, and since history first began it 
has, in some form or other, made one of the staples of diet among 
the peoples of the earth. While it is a far stretch from the leavened 
bread of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, or the crude corn bread 
of the Kafirs and American Indians, to the fancy products of the 
mammoth modern bakeries, the fact remains, that to-day bread 
still yields the greatest amount of nourishment for the least labor 
and cost, of any of the purely vegetable foods. The reason for the 
importance of bread is very simple. Ever since the far off days 
when the ancients first found the wild cereals, and our fore-fathers 
began to cultivate them, men have known that food prepared from 
them would support life and strength better than any other food. 
And although in our own land the ease with which we can get other 
food makes bread seem less important, it is as true to-day for the 
host to say, in asking the guest to partake of his fare, as it was for 
Him two thousand years ago, when He said, "Let me set a morsel 
of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayst have strength, 
when thou goest thy way." 

Hop Yeast. 

Put 1 cup hops in 3 quarts cold water. Boil 15 minutes, strain, 
set back on stove and add 5 large potatoes, peeled and grated, 3^ 
cup salt, same of sugar. Stir well, let boil up, take off, cool and add 
a cup of yeast. Beat thoroughly and set by the stove until it is 
Hght. If preferred, the potatoes may be boiled in the hop water, 
and then mashed, adding salt, sugar, and yeast as above. 

Potato Yeast. 

Take 3 large potatoes, peel and cut up. Pour on 1 quart boil- 
ing water and cook y^ hour. Add 3^ cup sugar and same of salt, 
shortly before it is done. When sufficiently cool, put in any good 
yeast to raise it, and stir well together. The next day it will be as 
light as foam. A teacup of this yeast will be enough to raise 4 or 5 
loaves of bread. 



4 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Bread in a Mixer. 

Set sponge with 1 compressed yeast cake in 1 teacup warm 
water, with flour enough to make a thin batter. Let rise till light 
then add 1 quart warm milk, which has been scalded and cooled; 
% teacup melted lard, 1 even tablespoon salt, and 1 heaping table- 
spoon sugar, and 3 quarts flour. Stir in the mixer 10 minutes, then 
set to rise again. When light stir 5 minutes longer, then turn out 
on the board and mold into loaves, using as little flour as possible. 
Raise again about % hour and bake % to 1 hour. Set the sponge 
about 7 o'clock in the morning and the bread will be out of the 
oven by 12:30, or 1 o'clock the same day. 

— Mrs. George Needham. 

Whole Wheat Bread. 

Cook 1 medium size potato, mash well and add sufficient warm 
water to make 1 quart, salt, 1 dry yeast cake dissolved in a little 
warm water, 1 large spoonful lard. Make a soft batter with white 
flour. Let stand over night. In the morning add 3^ cup molasses, 
]/2 teaspoon soda (scant), knead with whole wheat flour. Let it 
rise twice its bulk, mold into loaves and let rise again. Bake % 
to 1 hour. — Susan Whittlesey*. 

Sour Milk Bread. 

After dinner take 1 pint of buttermilk or nice sour milk and 
scald until it boils, stirring all the time to prevent curd forming. 
Then stir in flour enough to make batter, let cool until luke warm, 
add 1 yeast cake which has been soaked in 3^ cup cold water, beat 
well together and set in warm place until bed time, then set sponge 
with 1 quart warm water, 2 teaspoons sugar, 1 tablespoon lard, and 
lastly add yeast, cover and set in warm place. Add salt and knead 
well in the morning when it has raised; make into loaves, and grease 
each loaf with lard, which insures a tender, brown crust, and bake 
1 hour in a moderate oven. 

-Salt-Rising Bread. 

Stir 1 heaping teaspoon cornmeal in 3^^ cup scalding fresh milk 
at night. Put in bowl and set in a warm place. In the morning 
take 1 pint warm water, not scalding, a pinch of salt, and make a 
batter with flour, so it will drop off a knife. Stir in the mixture 
that has stood over night, beat it well, set it in a kettle of warm 
water, and keep at an even temperature. It will be light in about 2 
hours. Then add 13^ pints warm water, 1 teaspoon salt and flour 
to work into loaves. Knead until smooth, put into bread pans, set 
in warm place to rise, then bake.

CHAPTER II. 

SANDWICHES AND CANAPES. 

"Would you know how first he met her? 

She was cutting bread and butter." 

— Goethe. 

Sandwiches. 

Tlie first thing in malting sandwiches is to have a sharp knife. 
Bread should be one day old as it cuts better. Cream the butter 
and spread on the loaf before cutting. Cut as thin as possible. 
Remove crusts. Put the filling on to one slice and put the top slice 
over. Sandwiches can be kept fresh for hours by wrapping them 
in a damp napkin. 

Nut Sandwiches. 

Equal parts of grated cheese and chopped English walnuts, 
seasoned with salt and cayenne pepper. Spread between thin sHces 
of buttered bread. 

Horseradish Sandwiches. 

Mix thoroughly 3^ cup each of grated horseradish and fresh 
butter, Y2 teaspoon each of salt and sugar, and add 2 tablespoons 
lemon juice. Spread upon circles of brown bread, placing them 
together in pairs. 

Cheese Butter Sandwiches. 

One-half cup butter; 6 tablespoons dry sharp flavored cheese; 
1 teaspoon made mustard; 1 teaspoon anchovy paste or sauce; 2 
teaspoons Worcestershire sauce. Beat the butter to a cream, add 
the cheese (grated), mustard, anchovy and Worcestershire sauces. 
Beat till well blended and spread between slices of buttered bread.

brown bread or sunshine cake. 

Deviled Sandwiches.

whites of eggs and 1 tablespoon capers fine, season with salt, pap- 
rika and mustard. Mix all together, moisten with salad dressing

Cut bacon into small pieces and spread with the egg on toast be- 
tween lettuce. Add celery, cut in small pieces if desired. 

Peanut Sandwiches.

22 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Chive Sandwiches. 

Mix Neufchiitel and cream cheese together and add chives cut 
up fine and put between thin shces of bread and butter. 

— Mrs. W. W. Sawyer. 

Canapes 

These dainty little appetizers are made with a single layer of 
bread and for this reason can be made much more decorative than 
sandwiches. They are served in place of oysters at a dinner or 
luncheon. At a gentlemen's dinner they are frequently served with 
a glass of sherry before entering the dining room. For cold canapes 
the bread is cut in thin slices and then cut out with a round cutter 
and covered with some highly seasoned mixture and decor- 
ated. For hot canapes, the bread, after it is cut in shape, is fried 
in deep fat or buttered and browned in the oven. 

Ham Canapes. 

Slice bread a quarter of an inch thick, then with a biscuit cut- 
ter about 3 inches in diameter, cut the bread into rounds. Butter 
the rounds, spread with some highly seasoned deviled ham and 
arrange on top in alternate circles, lines of chopped pickle and hard 
boiled egg minced fine. Serve on small plates with a sprig of curly 
parsley to give added color. 

Cheese Canapes. 

Cut quarter inch slices into rounds. Spread first with softened 
butter, then a thin layer of French mustard. Sprinkle very hber- 
ally with grated cheese and in the center of each place a seeded 
olive or a tiny mound of chopped pickles. If desired hot, spread 
the bread with a little French mustard, dip in melted butter and 
then sprinkle a thick layer of grated cheese, season with salt and 
cayenne pepper and place in the oven to soften the cheese. Serve 
at once. 

Sardine Canapes. 
Bone the sardines, then rub them to a paste, add a little oil 
from the can, mustard, lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Cut 
the bread into rounds and fry in butter until it is a delicate brown 
on both sides. Spread with the mixture and decorate with the 
whites and yolks of hard boiled eggs, each run through a ricer sep- 
arately. Cover the center of the canape with the whites, encircle 
the edge with a ring of the yellow and (h'op a bit of the yellow in 
the center of each. 



SANDWICHES AND CANAPES. 23 

Anchovy Canapes. 

Cut 3>€ inch thick pieces of bread with a round cutter. Spread 
with a mayonnaise dressing. Boil eggs hard, when cold chop the 
whites fine and put the yolks through a potato ricer, and put an 
outside circle of the whites of the eggs on top of the dressing, fill 
the circle with the riced yolks and put a curled anchovy on top in 
the center, or use the straight anchovies split in two lengthwise, 
laid on to divide the canape in quarters. If the canape is desired 
hot, use the fried or toasted bread. 

Caviare Canapes. 

Canapes of caviare are much better served with cold bread than 
hot or toasted. Prepare the round slices of bread as for anchovy 
canapes. Spread with mayonnaise dressing and the riced hard 
boiled egg as before and put about 3^ of a teaspoon of caviare in 
the center on top. Caviare is the salted roe of the sturgeon. 

Tomato Canape. 

Cut bread in rounds as for other canapes, place one slice of ripe 
raw tomato (chilled) on each round. The bread rounds should 
be the same size as the tomato. Spread mayonnaise dressing on 
top of the tomato, put one curled anchovy in the center of each 
and surround it with an olive chopped up. This is the amount for 
each person. Place on small plates.

CHAPTER III. 

CEREALS. 

"We cultivate literature on a little oatmeal." 

— Sydney Smith. 

In purchasing any cereals small quantities should be obtained 
and kept in air-tight vessels. Cereals, to be healthful should be 
well cooked and in most every case it is safe to double the time of 
that given on the package. In cooking, use a double boiler and mix 
the finer preparations with a little cold water before adding to the 
boiling water. This will prevent the cereal from becoming lumpy. 
A teaspoon of salt should be allowed to each cupful of cereal. 

Table for Cooking. 

Prepared wheat, 1 cup; water, \}/2 cups; time 30 minutes. 
Prepared oats, 1 cup; water, 13^ cups; time 40 minutes. 
Rice (steamed), 1 cup; water, 3 cups; time 50 minutes. 
,. Indian meal, 1 cup; water, 33^ cups; time 3 hours. 
Scotch oatmeal, 1 cup; water, 4 cups; time, 4 hours. 
Hominy (coarse), 1 cup; water, 6 cups; time, 6 hours. 
Hominy (fine), 1 cup; water, 4 cups; time 3 hours. 
Wheat (cracked), 1 cup; water, 6 cups; time, 6 hours. 

Farina Fruit Mush. 

Fruit mushes served cold generally are appreciated for break- 
fast in place of the usual cereal. Blackberries, currants and rasp- 
berries are suitable as a foundation. Slowly heat the fruit until 
scalded, then press out the juice. Put into a double boiler; if cur- 
rants form the basis sweeten slightly; to each pint add one table- 
spoonful of farina and cook, stirring frequently, for % of an hour. 
Pour into one large or a number of individual molds and set aside. 

Corn Meal Mush. 

In cooking corn meal, either white or yellow, let water boil to 
bubbling point, then remove from fire, and sprinkle corn meal in 
very slowly, then put back on stove and cook about 10 or 15 min- 
utes, stirring constantly. 



CEREALS. 25 

Fried Corn Meal Mush. 

Cook the mush Hke above recipe. Wiien it is done pack it in 
a bread pan to cool. . When cold cut it in slices about half an inch 
and fry in a skillet in butter, or cut the pieces thicker and then cut 
in two and fry in deep fat. Cold hominy and cold oat meal mush 
can be fried in the same manner. 

Spaghetti a la Italienne. 

Fry 6 pork chops brown with 3 large sliced onions, adding 
butter or oil if needed. Pour over 2 cans of tomatoes, slice in 3 or 4 
whole roots of garlic which have been peeled, salt and paprika to 
season. Simmer slowly until the bones are bare and the sauce is 
dark and thick, adding a little boiling water from time to time if 
needed. It will take 7 hours or more, as it must cook slowly. Rub 
through a frying basket, pressing through as much of the pulp as 
possible. Cook a large handful of unbroken imported spaghetti 
until tender in boiling salted water. Drain, rinse in boiling water, 
pour the sauce over and serve grated Parmensan or Swiss cheese 
separately. 

— Myrtle Reed McCullough, 

Genuine Italian Spaghetti. 

One package spaghetti, drop in boiling water and cook until 
tender; drain. Sauce — 1 quart can tomatoes, 1 can mushrooms, 
1 cup grated cheese, 2 onions, 3^ pound bacon. Cut onions and 
bacon fine and fry till tender; add tomatoes, mushrooms, dash of 
paprika, a little Worcester sauce, 2 dessert spoons salt, and a little 
celery salt. Cook all this until thick, add to spaghetti. When 
ready to serve, stir in the cup of cheese. 

— Mrs. Frank Edmison. 

Spaghetti a la Ellery Band. 
Use 1 quart can tomatoes, strain contents through a sieve. 
To this liquid add 3 tablespoons olive oil, piece of butter size of egg, 
a teaspoon sugar, small bunch parsley, 3 small cloves of garlic, or 
onion if you prefer, salt and pepper to taste, and some sweet green 
pepper, chopped. Boil all this down over slow fire to thickness of 
cream. If possible, obtain imported Italian spaghetti; this is dis- 
tinctly superior to domestic. Boil spaghetti (2 pounds for above 
amount of sauce) in plenty of water in which you have put a gen- 
erous amount of salt. Above all things do not put spaghetti into 



26 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

water until it boils and do not cut it up into little snippy pieces, as 
that is un-Italian and utterly inadmissable. Last but not least, 
do not cook your spaghetti to a pasty mass, but remove it, and 
drain through a colander when it is just right. Pour sauce over 
and serve on large platter. Grated cheese, Parmesan preferred, 
should be served separately for those who desire it. 

— Channing Ellery. 



Macaroni and Cheese. 
Break half a package of macaroni in small pieces. Cook briskly 
in boiling salted water for 20 minutes, drain and rinse. Butter a 
shallow dish, put in layer macaroni, sprinkle with salt, dot with 
pieces of butter, and over it a layer of cheese, grate<:l. Repeat this 
until macaroni is all used, leaving a sprinkling of cheese wath butter 
in small pieces on top. Beat 1 egg, add 14, pint milk, salt and pepper, 
pour over all and bake, covered, 3^ hour. Remove cover and brown. 

How to Boil Rice. 

Rinse 1 cup rice in two waters. Put over fire 2 quarts water 
in large kettle, add to this 1 even teaspoon salt, sprinkle rice slowly 
in water, cover tightly, and let cook 20 minutes. Water must be 
boiling before rice is put in, let cook rapidly without stirring. Re- 
move from fire, put rice in colander to drain, then set in oven for 
few minutes until it steams itself dry. Every kernel should be 
separate. 

— L. D. W. 

Spanish Rice — Tribune Prize Receipt. 

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in frying pan; when hot, add 1 cup 
dry rice; fry until brown, stirring continually; add 1 pint water, 1 
small onion, chopped fine, salt and pepper and 3^ quart can toma- 
toes. Cook 30 minutes, covered. 

Rice Molds. 

One quart of milk and water equal parts, half teaspoon of salt, 
1 cup of sugar; bring to boiling point; 1 cup of ground rice, moisten

COFFEE, TEA, CHOCOLATE AND COCOA. 31 



CHAPTER IV. 

COFFEE, TEA, CHOCOLATE 
AND COCOA. 

Coffee 

"May your coffee and slanders against you be ever the same 
— without grounds." 

The best grades of coffee are the Mocha and Java, bought 
either in the grain to be roasted and ground as needed in the home, 
or purchased in small quantities freshly roasted and ground. Most 
people prefer a mixture of the two, using one-third of Mocha and 
two-thirds of Java. Always keep in a closely covered tin or earthen 
jar to retain the full strength of the berry. When properly roasted, 
coffee should grind into small but distinct, hard and gritty par- 
ticles, instead of into a fine powder. There are various ways of 
making coffee and many different coffee pots on the market, but 
there a few general rules that it is wise to keep in mind. Always 
buy the best grades of coffee and be sure that the pot is as tight as 
possible to prevent the escape of the aroma. Of course the coffee 
should not have to stand long after being made. To make one 
quart of coffee take one cupful of coffee, one-third of a raw egg, 
to clear it, half a cupful of cold water and one quart of boiling 
water. Stir coffee, egg and cold water together before adding boil- 
ing water or the heat from the latter will cook the egg. One cup- 
ful of coffee calls for a tablespoon of coffee, the same of cold water 
and one teaspoonful of egg with a cupful of boiling water added 
last. Do not use too much egg in the making of coffee as it weakens 
it. Egg shells may be saved and used for clearing, the albumen, 
which clings to the shell, performing the office. About three 
crushed egg-shells are sufficient for clearing purposes when one 
cup of ground coffee is used. By using egg the coffee has a richer 
flavor which egg alone can give, but when strict economy is neces- 
sary the egg may be omitted if great care is taken in the making 
and handling, as very much motion causes it to become muddy. 
Do not use a tin coffee-pot as the tannic acid in coffee acts on such 
metal and is apt to form a poisonous compound. Always see that

other warm place for 5 minutes. Then strain and serve immedi- 
ately, with or without sugar and milk. Avoid a, second steeping of 
the Uuives as, if this is done, so large an amouid- of tatuiin is ex- 
tracted that various ills are apt to follow.

Iced Tea. 

Four teaspoons tea; 2 cups l)oiling water. Follow recipe for 
making tea, strain into glasses which are 3:3 full of cracked ice. 
Sweeten to taste, and allow 1 slice lemon to each glass of tea. By 
chilling the infusion quickly, the flavor is much better. 

Russian Tea. 

Follow recipe for making tea. Russian tea may be served 
either hot or cold, but always without milk. A thin slice of lemon 
or a few drops of lemon juice is allowed for each cup. Add sugar 
according to the taste. In Russia a preserved strawberry is some- 
times added. 

Wellesley Tea. 

This tea is made the same as iced tea. Before straining place 
3 crushed mint leaves in glasses 

Herb Teas. 

For the dried herbs use 1 teaspoonful to a cup of boiling water. 
Cover and stand where they will not boil, for 5 or 10 minutes. Strain 
before serving. Too long steeping makes them bitter or acrid with- 
out increasing their medicinal value. 

Chocolate and Cocoa 

These contain in good proportion all the elements necessary 
to nourish the body. Cocoa is the seed of the fruit of a small tropi- 
cal tree, and there are several forms in which it is sold, the most 
nutritious and convenient being chocolate. Next in order comes 
cocoa, cocoa nibs and last cocoa shells. The ground bean is called 
cocoa. Ground finer and mixed with sugar it becomes chocolate. 
The broken beans are called "nibs" and the shells are the parts of 
the bean that are removed before grinding. These shells make a 
delicate drink, but contain little nourishment. Pure chocolate is 
easily assimilated and digested as food by those able to take fat, 
as about 50 per cent, of chocolate consists of fat. In cocoa the ex- 
cess of fat is removed. Vanilla is the best flavor to add to choco- 
late. Cinnamon also is good. Neither chocolate or cocoa should 
be boiled too long or the flavor is impaired. 

Breakfast Cocoa 

One and one-half tablespoons prepared cocoa; 2 tablespoons 
sugar; 2 cups boiling water; 2 cups milk; pinch of salt. Scald milk, 
then mix together cocoa and sugar and dilute with 3^ cup of boil- 
ing water to make a smooth paste, add remaining water, and boil 
1 minute. Turn into scalded milk and beat for 2 minutes. 



COFFEE, TEA, CHOCOLATE AND COCOA. 35 

Brandy Cocoa. 

Three tablespoons cocoa; 13^ cups boiling water; 3^ cup sugar; 
4 cups milk; 3 teaspoons cooking brandy. Prepare as Reception 
cocoa, then add brand}^ before beating. 

Reception Cocoa. 

Three tablespoons cocoa; a few grains salt; }/i cup sugar; 4 
cups milk; ^ cup boiling water. Scald milk; mix cocoa, sugar and 
salt, adding enough boiling water to make a smooth paste; then 
add what water remains and boil 1 minute; pour into scalded milk 
and beat 2 minutes with egg beater. 

Chocolate. 

One and one-half squares of chocolate; 1 cup boiling water; 
3^ cup of sugar; few grains of salt; 3 cups milk. Scald milk; melt 
chocolate in small sauce pan placed over hot water, add sugar, salt 
and gradually boiling water; when smooth place on range and boil 
1 minute; add scalded milk and beat with egg beater and serve in 
chocolate cups with whipped cream. One and one-half ounces 
vanilla chocolate may be used instead of chocolate; this being 
sweetened, less sugar is required. 

Chocolate Syrup. 

On 3 tablespoons of soluable chocolate or cocoa pour 1 pint of 
boiling water, stirring all the time. Place on fire and stir until all 
is dissolved, then add 1 pint of granulated sugar, stirring until it 
boils. Boil for 3 minutes, strain, cool and flavor with vanilla. Keep 
the syrup in a cool place. Serve with 3 tablespoons of the syrup in 
each glass, lumps of ice, a little cream and the rest of the glass filled 
up with milk. Buy soluable chocolate at drug stores for this recipe. 
Ask for the kind used in making fountain syrups.

CHAPTER V. 

SOUPS. 

"Soup is to the dinner what the door is to the house." 

Introduction. 

Exactness in cooking removes the danger of failure. Recipes 
should be exactly copied. The skeleton of soups must be accurate, 
but more seasoning or more thickening may be added to suit the 
individual taste. 

Soups should be brought to the boiling point and then pushed 
back on the stove to simmer, as boiled soups are greasy and muddy. 
Seasonings are important. Winter vegetables, such as turnips, car- 
rots, celery and onions should be kept on hand for soup; also sweet 
herbs, including thyme, savory, marjoram, bay leaves, peppercorns, 
cloves, allspice berries, stick cinnamon, dry tarragon leaves, brown- 
ing, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, with additions of salt, pepper 
and parsley are essentials for soup stocks. Flour, cornstarch, arrow- 
root, fine tapioca, sago, pearl barley., rice, bread or eggs are added 
to give consistency and nourishment to the soups. 

Vegetables and seasonings should be added the last hour. 

In getting meat from the market, have bone and meat cut into 
small pieces. When ready to start soup, put meat and bone in soup 
kettle, cover well with cold water. Let stand 1 hour to draw out 
juices; heat gradually to boiling point; set on back of stove and let 
simmer 6 to 7 hours. This will form stock for many kinds of soup. 

To clear soup stock: Add white of an egg or washed egg shells 
(2 or 3) to cold strained stock and bring to a boil slowly. Then re- 
move from fire and strain through flannel cloth. 

Brown Soup Stock. 

Six pounds shin of beef; 3 quarts cold water; 3^ teaspoon 
peppercorns; 6 cloves; ^ bay leaf; 3 sprigs thyme; 1 sprig marjoram; 
2 sprigs parsley; 3^ cup each carrot, turnip, onion and celery; cut 
in dice. Wipe beef and cut lean meat in inch cubes. Brown 3^ 
meat in hot frying pan in marrow from marrow bone. Put the rest 



SOUPS. 37 

of the meat fat in soup kettle, add water and let it stand 30 minutes. 
Put on back of range, add browned meat and heat slowly to the 
boiling point. As scum rises it should be removed. Cover and cook 
slowly 6 hours, not boiling. Add vegetables and seasoning; cook 
13^2 hours. Strain and cool as quickly as possible. 

—Mrs. Charles Reitsch. 

White Soup Stock. 

Three pounds knuckle of veal; 1 pound lean beef; 3 quarts 
boiling water; 1 onion; 6 slices carrot; 1 large stalk celery; 3^ tea- 
spoon peppercorns; ^ bay leaf; 2 sprigs thyme; 6 cloves. Wipe 
veal, remove bone and cut in small pieces; cut beef in small pieces; 
put bone and meat in kettle and cover with cold water and bring 
quickly to boihng point, drain and throw away the water. Wash 
thoroughly bones and meat in cold water; return to kettle; add 
vegetables, seasoning and 3 quarts boiling water. Boil 3 or 4 hours. 

Stock reduced half.

Bouquet to color. Soak meat in cold water 1 hour; then heat to 
boiling point; skim thoroughly and allow to simmer 5 hours. Add 
vegetables and seasonings the last hour. Strain and cool. Remove 
fat when cooled. 

Hot bouillon is also served with grated Parmesan cheese. 

Iced bouillon flavored with sherry wine is served cold. 

Good Soup. 

Two pounds beef; 2 pounds veal; 1 pound mutton; slice of beef 
liver. Put in kettle of cold water and place over fire. As it cooks, 
salt well and remove scum. Roast an onion in the oven and when 
brown, cut fine and add to the soup. Also add the celery tops, 
parsley and cabbage leaves. Brown in butter 2 potatoes sliced, 
add to the soup with carrots and cauliflower. Cook slowly for 2 or 
23^ hours. Strain through a fine sieve, and add noodles, rice or 
barley, whichever is preferred. Barley should be cooked a full 
hour, rice 20 minutes, and noodles only long enough to cook through.

Cream of Tomato Soup. 

Put 1 pint of tomatoes on to heat, with a pinch of salt and one 
of soda, in a vessel that will hold not less than a quart. In another 
vessel put a quart of milk to heat, and in a granite pan that sets on 
a tea-kettle when the lid is off, put 1 heaping tablespoon of butter; 
when it is melted add 2 heaping tablespoons of flour and mix with 
butter until all is smooth, and add this to the well cooked toma- 
toes, beating until all is mixed well, and set on the stove to heat, 
watching and stirring it all the time. Then pour heated milk into 
the tomatoes and mix thoroughly until it becomes thick, and then 
serve to four people. This is a sure way to keep milk from curdling, 
also makes delicious soup. Onions may be added to tomatoes 
when they are canned purposely for soup, if desired. Tomatoes 
may be strained if desired. This is simple, good and practical. 

Soup From Left-Overs. 

Slice an onion into a teaspoon of melted butter; brown well. 
Add a pint (more or less) of milk. When hot, add Y^ a cupful or 
less of creamed potatoes, peas, cauliflower, singly or combined; 
rub through a coarse sieve; season with salt and paprika, and serve. 
The flavor may be varied by the addition of beef extract, or a few 
drops of Kitchen Bouquet. If the original cream sauce has not 
furnished enough thickening, rub 2 teaspoons of flour in a little 
cold milk. Or, beat well yolks of 2 eggs, pour on them slowly 
about Y2 a cup of the hot soup, stirring rapidly; then add to the re- 
maining soup and serve immediately. This makes a nourishing 
and cheap luncheon soup.

when the scraps are a good brown take them out and put in a large 
bowl of chopped onions to fry. They should be fried in a frying 
pan and the chowder kettle be made clean before they are put in it, 
(The chief secret in chowder making is to fry the onions so deli- 
cately that they will be missing in the chowder.) Add a quart of 
hot water to the onions, put in the clams, clam water, and pork 
scraps. After it boils add a large bowd of potatoes cut into eighths

FISH. 53 



CHAPTER VI. 

FISH AND METHOD OF COOKING. 

FISH. 

Fish a la Perfection. 

From a Man's Point of Mew. 

Take a guide, go miles from anywhere, catch bass or trout, 
have it prepared with salt-pork or bacon, have it served on a gen- 
erous slice of bread, accompany it with a cup of fine coffee, top 
off with a good cigar, and then feel like thanking the stars that 
you are alive. 

— Harrison M. Wild. 

Fish should be butchered while alive, slit about 1 inch from 
the tail, up, hung in the shade about ^ of an hour to bleed. Pre- 
pared in this way will ahvays retain its flavor. Fish are good 
when the gills are red, eyes are full, and the body firm and stiff. 

Table for Cooking Fish. 

Trout should always be boiled or baked. White fish is good 
boiled, but best broiled. Black bass, when large, boiled; when 
small, broiled. Red-snapper should alwa3"s be boiled. Muscalonge, 
baked or boiled. Fresh mackerel should be broiled. Perch, Smelts, 
Brook Trout, Ciscoes, Bull-heads and Herrings are all better fried. 

To Boil Fish. 
Place in cold, salt water before cooking, to make it firm. When 
ready to cook place in cloth bag or wrap in cloth tied tightly, put 
in cold water and boil. Always put salt in the water before cooking. 

To Fry Fish. 

Clean, wash and dry thoroughly. Dip in yolk of egg well beaten ; 
then in fine grated bread crumbs, flour or meal. If wished to look 
extra nice, repeat the egg and bread crumbs. Fry in boiling lard, 
a light brown, and serve hot free from grease. Fish fried in Olive 
oil adds greatly to the flavor. 



54 THE MKNDFLS.SOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

To Broil Fish. 

Wash and wipe the fish dry, and spht. Lay on the broiler 
with the skin up. When browned, turn. Have some butter, with 
pepper and salt in it, and mop it over the fish while broiling. It 
will take about 20 minutes to cook one of medium size. Serve on 
hot dish, and pour over it drawn butter.

ches square, and lay them on a clean dry cloth. Have in readiness 
a dripping pan or a large frying pan containing hot fat 3^ inch deep, 
roll the fish in flour seasoned with salt and pepper, put it into the 
fat while smoking hot and fry it brown on both sides; use a broad 
spatula or cake turner to turn over the pieces in order to preserve 
them entire. As quickly as the pieces brown lift them out of the 
pan, la}' them on brown paper for a minute to free them from fat 
and then turn them onto a hot dish. Serve with lemons, pickles 
or cucumbers.

ful of grated horseradish, 2 teaspoonfuls of catsup, a dash of 
Worcestershire sauce and a pinch of salt. An oyster cocktail is 
also acceptably served in the center of a small grape fruit from 
which the core has been removed. 

Oyster Cocktail for 5 Persons. 

One tablespoonful Worcestershire; 1 tablespoonful Targon 
vinegar; 1 tablespoonful catsup, Snyder's; 1 tablespoonful lemon 
juice; 1 teaspoonful horseradish; 3^ teaspoonful tobasco sauce; 
salt to taste. Serve cracked ice and 1 tablespoonful in each dish 
of oysters. 

• — Mrs. Arthur Fisher. 

Oyster Stew. 
To 1 quart of solid oysters use 1 pint of water; when hot, 
skim. Put in a kettle with butter, salt and pepper. Boil 3 minutes, 
add 1 quart of new milk which has been previously heated. Bring 
all to nearly boiling point and serve immediately. 

Panned Oysters. 

Drain the oysters from the liquor; put them in hot pan or 
spider as soon as they begin to curl; add butter, pepper and salt. 
Serve on toast or without if preferred. 

Fried Oysters. 
Only very fresh oysters should be used — beware of those with 
a green streak down the back. 1 loaf of dry bakers bread (very 
much better than cracker crumbs); grate this on a grater, dry the 
oysters, roll in flour, salt and pepper. Dip in batter made of 1 egg 
and 1 tablespoonful of milk, then roll in bread crumbs; repeat 3 
times, fry in deep fat. Have the fat smoking hot, fry 1 minute. 

— Mrs. Gussie Miner, The Thadwa. 

Escalloped Oysters. 
Put layer of cracker crumbs (not too fine) in bottom of but- 
tered bake dish,, then layer of oysters, little lumps of butter; re- 
peat this until dish is filled. Save the liquor, add milk, salt and 
pepper and moisten well. Bake in a hot oven with cover on, till 
the last half hour; remove cover and brown nicely. 

— Mrs. T. V. Engstrom.

Oyster Omelet. 

Beat separately the whites and 3'olks of 5 eggs. Soak 1 cup 
of fine bread crumbs in 1 cup of milk with a little salt, add 1 cup 
chopped oysters drained and seasoned; lastly the stiffly beaten 
whites. Fry in buttered pan. — Mrs. W. S. M-iller. 

Oyster Patties. 

Make a rich cream dressing, then add oysters; cook until 
edges curl up, about 3 minutes. Then serve in patties made of 
rich puff paste. 

Lobsters. 

Lobsters should alwa3's be cooked alive, never dead, for a 
dead lobster is poison. The only poison or unhealthy part of a 
Hve lobster is the dark vein running through the head. This is 
removed after the lobster is cooked before it is eaten. Baked lob- 
sters are as good as broiled lobsters and are much more easily pre- 
pared. Live lobsters should always be kept in sea water and should 

never be kept very long before cooking. 

— Mrs. Chandler Starr. 

Baked Live Lobsters. 

SpHt a live lobster and put in a roasting pan in a very hot 
oven; cook about 15 minutes. The liver (or tomalley) cooked with 
1 tablespoonful of butter about 3 or 5 minutes and seasoned with 
salt, Cayenne pepper and Worcestershire sauce makes a dressing 
for the baked lobster. — Mrs. Chandler Starr. 

Boiled Live Lobster. 

Take a chicken lobster (or baby lobster as it is also called); 
put alive in a kettle of boiling sea water or fresh water salted. Put 
a cover and weight on top of kettle and boil for 20 minutes or un- 
til it has turned from green to a beautiful scarlet. Crack the shells 
in kitchen and serve hot on platter. The meat is delicate and de- 
licious. Take out of shells at table and eat with a little butter, 
salt and pepper. — Mrs. D. F. Scott, 

Creamed Lobster. 

One pint of lobster meat (chopped or picked up). 1 cup white 

sauce seasoned with celery, parsley and a Httle Cayenne pepper. 

Mix with the lobster and put in a baking dish, covering the top 

with cracker crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven. 

— Mrs. D. F. Scott. 



62 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Lobster a la Newberg. 

Meat of a boiled lobster or 1 can of lobster; good sized lumps 
of butter; 1 gill of Sherry; 1 pint cream; yolks of 2 eggs. Glass of 
Sarentine (may be omitted). Put lobster into a pan or chafing 
dish with butter, stir gently until thoroughly heated. Mix Sherry, 
cream and yolks of eggs, first eggs and cream. Pour over lobster 
and let simmer, then add Sarentine, if used. Pour over toasted 
bread. Sherry may also be omitted. 

— ^Mrs. T. V. Engstrom. 



Lobster Cutlets. 

Put 2 tablespoonfuls of butter in a dish over a fire; when 

melted add 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, rub together until smooth, 

then add 1 cup of sweet cream, salt; when thickened add 3^ pound 

of lobsters, diced. Turn out on well buttered platter and cool, 

then cut in the form of cutlets, dip in egg, then in cracker crumbs, 

and fry in deep fat. 

— Mrs. Edwin M. St. John. 



Shrimps. 

Shrimps are served on the Pacific Coast, boiled and served in 
their shells, which are easily opened. After removing from shell 
the little dark streak should be pulled out. They are also delicious 
in salad combined with equal parts of celery and Mayonnaise 
poured over them. 

Buttered Shrimps. 

Shell some shrimps and place in a frying pan with a lump of 
butter, a small quantity of salt and pepper and stir over fire until 
hot. Fry thin slices of bread in butter, drain, when a golden brown, 
place them on a hot dish, pile buttered shrimps on bread and serve. 

Creamed Shrimps. 

Prepare the shrimps, taking them from the shells or the can 

and let stand in cold water for Y^ hour; make a rich cream dressing, 

break the shrimps in little dice and add to the cream sauce. Put 

this in Ramikens, with bread crumbs on top and brown i n the 

oven nicely. 

— Mrs. Fannie Moffatt. 



FISH. 63 

Steamed Clams. 

Clams for steaming should always be alive and in the shell. 
Wash the shells thoroughly and put in steamer over a kettle of 
boiling water; steam about 20 minutes. Serve in large soup plates, 
in shells. The true way to eat, is to take the shell up in the fingers, 
open it and take out the clam and dip in a saucer of melted butter 
and eat. It is a dish fit for the Gods. Only novices attempt to eat 
steamed clams with a knife and fork. 

— Mrs. Daisy Force Scott. 

Stewed Soft Clams. 

Thoroughly wash about 33/^ dozen fresh soft clams so that no 
sand remains in them after they are opened; lay them carefully on 
the palm of the left hand and with the right hand remove the body 
with care, but nothing more, being cautious not to break it, and 
throwing away all the other part. When all are prepared, place 
them in a stew pan with 1 ounce of butter, small pinch of white 
pepper, 1 wine glass of Maderia wine and 2 finely hashed medium 
sized truffles;' place the cover on pan and cook gently for 7 or 8 min- 
utes. Break the yolks of 3 eggs into a bowl, add 1 pint of sweet 
cream and beat well for 3 minutes. Pour this over the clams and 
toss the sauce pan for about 3 minutes more very gently to thor- 
oughly mix the clams with the cream, but not letting the liquor boil 
again. Neither a fork or spoon should ever be used in mixing them. 
Serve in hot dish at once. 

Clam Fritters. 

Place some fresh clams into one pan, and the liquor from them 
into another. Prepare a mixture of broken crackers and flour in 
equal quantities and dip the clams first into their own liquor and 
then into this, repeating this operation 3 times, finally dipping 
them into milk, and then again into the flour mixture. Have pre- 
pared some boiling lard, drop in a few clams at a time, let them 
fry for about 5 minutes; then remove them with a skimmer, place 
them on a strainer, drain away the fat, and they are ready to be 
served. The pan containing the lard should be so deep that the 
clams will be covered when put in. 

Crabs. 
Crabs are in season from April to September. The richest 
flavored crabs are those of medium size, say from 6 to 10 inches 
in their broadest diameter. They should be boiled alive, being 



64 THF AIKXDELSSOHN CLUB COOK HOOIv. 

plunged into cold water and as the water warms a handful or so of 
salt should be thrown in. Boil 20 minutes or Y2 hour, according 
to size. Some authorities claim that if they are put in hot water 
first they are apt to throw ofT their claws by a violent jerk and then 
the water would soak into the flesh and make it sloppy. The scum 
should be carefully skimmed off after the salt is put in. They 
should be firm and stiff and the eyes bright. The male crab has 
the largest claws, therefore is much more preferable. 

Broiled Soft-Shell Crabs. 

Dip some soft shell crabs into melted butter and season with 
pepper and salt. Broil them until the shells are shghtly brown. 
As soon as done, serve them hot, with melted butter or lemon juice 
or with a lemon cut into quarters. Slices of hot toast should be 
laid under them. 

Stone Crabs. 

Should be served cold as they are considered dangerous to eat 
hot. Plunge in boiling hot water, cook 30 minutes. Break shells 
with hammer; serve on platter with tartare sauce or French dressing. 

— Mrs. Gussie Miner, The Thadwa. 

Deviled Crabs. 

One quart crab meat; 3 large boiled potatoes, chopped fine; 
\^ pound bacon, chopped; 1 tablespoonful cracker meal; 2 eggs; 
salt, pepper and Cayenne pepper. Put back in shell and bake 1 
hour, baste with butter and water. 

— Mrs. Gussie Miner, The Thadwa. 



Frogs Legs. 

Lay the frogs on their backs. Make a long incision from the 
neck along the side of the belly. Make another at right angles 
across the middle of the belly, dissect, cut the entrails and cut away 
the head, leaving only the back and legs. Skin the frogs and chop 
off their feet. Wash them thoroughly and blanch in scalding 
salted water. Prepare 18 in this way, lay the hind quarters in a 
dish and pour over them 2 tablespoonfuls of sweet oil. Seasoning 
with salt and pepper and a little lemon juice; roll them around 
several times in this seasoning, place in a broiler and broil for 4 
minutes on each side. Arrange on a hot dish and serve. 



FISH. 65 

Frog Legs Provencal Fashion. 

Remove the bones from the legs and cut the meat in 3^ inch 
pieces. Melt 2 tablespoonfuls of butter in the blazer, and in it 
saute the pieces of meat to a golden brown color. At the same 
time saute in the pan, for each cup of meat, 2 mushroom caps, 
peeled and broken in pieces, and a small bit of garlic, crushed fine. 
When all are browned, stir in 2 tablespoonfuls of flour and a dash 
of salt and pepper. Stir and cook until the flour is absorbed, then 
add half a cup each, of rich, brown stock and tomato puree. Stir 
until the boiling point is reached, then finish with 4 or 5 small, 
stoned olives, twice as many bits of cooked carrot, and 2 table- 
spoonfuls of claret wine, and serve. 

Baked Terrapin. 

Cut off the head of a live Terrapin, put it into a pot of boil- 
ing hot water, with the shell on and boil, until under shell can be 
removed easily. Take out all the meat, cleaning the upper shell 
thoroughly; pick meat to pieces and mix it up with a few crackers 
and chopped onions, a small quantity each of allspice, black pepper, 
chopped parsley and butter, and pour over a small quantity of 
wine. Put back into top shell, place slices of lemon on top, set 
n oven and bake. When done, serve hot. 

Terrapin a la Maryland. 

Cut the bones and entrails of 1 terrapin into small pieces and 
with the meat cook them in 1 cup of chicken stock and 2 table- 
spoons of wine slowly till the liquor is cooked down one-half. Cut 
the liver in pieces and add it with the yolks of 3 eggs, slightly beaten; 
1 teaspoon lemon juice; 23^ tablespoons butter, creamed with 1 
tablespoon flour; 14, cup cream; add salt, black and Cayenne pep- 
per to, taste. Cook a little longer and just before serving add 1 
tablespoon sherry.

CHAPTER VII. 



MEATS. 



Beef. 

Tastes differ as to the choice cuts and butchers cut differently. 
From the hind-quarter of beef are cut the rump for boiling or roast- 
ing, the round, the rump, the sirloin and the porter-house steaks. 
From the hip bone to the ribs are cut the porter-house steaks. The 
larger porter-house steaks, containing larger portions of the tender- 
loin, are near the hip bone. The smaller porter-house steaks, con- 
taining almost no tenderloin, sometimes called club-house steaks, 
are near the ribs. 

The tenderloin, which is the choicest piece, when removed 
whole, is called the fillet and may be used for roasting or broihng. 
It lies under the short ribs and close to the back-bone and is usually 
cut through with the porter-house and sirloin steaks. Of these 
the porter-house is usually preferred. The small porter-house 
steaks are the most economical, but in the larger steaks the coarse 
and tough parts may be used for soups, or, after boiling, for hash, 
which is really a very nice dish when well made. 

A round steak is sweet and juicy when the leg is not cut down 
too far, the objection being its toughness, to cancel which it may 
be chopped fine, seasoned and made into croquettes. There is no 
waste in it, hence it is the most economical to buy. The interior 
portion is the tenderest and best. Round steak, if well pounded 
to make it tender, has the best flavor. The best beef for a la mode 
is also the round. Have the bone removed and trim off all the 
gristle. 

The choicest portions of beef for roasting are the ribs, the five 
first of which are the ''prime ribs." This cut is the finest and best 
flavored piece of the beef for roasting, excepting possibly the sir- 
loin, which is rarely used as a roast in this country. 

The sirloin as a roast is second to none, but for carving it needs 
an experienced hand; the loss through trimming and cooking is- 
more than one-third its weight. Another piece of beef sometimes 
used for roasting is the rump or short hip of beef. It is more suit- 



70 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

able for braising or for steaks. It is not, however, considered as 
juicy as are the other portions of the beef. 

The best cuts for pot-roasts are the rump, round arm piece 
and the chuck roast. 

For those who wish lean corn-beef which will slice nicely, the 
rump is best. If some fat is desired with the lean, select a fancy 
brisket or plate piece. 

Mutton. 

For roasting mutton choose the leg or loin. The loin is the 
sweeter, but very wasteful. The leg of mutton is more economical 
for boiling or roasting and slices beautifully. For stews use either 
the breast or shoulder. The breast is sweeter, but the shoulder has 
more lean meat in proportion. The loin mutton chop is considered 
to be more tender, but the rib chop is sweeter. With the meat 
trimmed from the end of the rib and prepared for the paper holder, 
it is called the French Chop. The loin chop, with the bone removed 
and fastened in a circular form by a skewer, is known as the Eng- 
lish Chop. 

In selecting beef or mutton, choose that which has plenty of 
white, fine-grained fat. 

Spring Lamb. 

The hind-quarter of spring lamb is more easily carved than 
the front-quarter and is also more expensive. The front-quarter 
is considered to be much sweeter and can be boned before cooking. 

The crown roast of lamb is probably the most attractive 
form in which a lamb roast can be served. It is taken from the 
fore-quarter of the lamb. The meat is formed in a circle with the 
ends of the ribs "Frenched," the whole representing a crown. 

Veal. 

Veal is best from calves not less than four nor more than six 
weeks old. The meat should be clear and firm and the fat white. 
If dark and thin, with tissues hanging looseh" about the bone, it 
is not good. 

The choicest roast of veal is the loin with the kidney left in. 
For broiling or frying, the rib or loin chops are the sweetest and 
tenclerest, but many prefer the cutlets from the leg or round. 

The knuckle of veal is the part left after the fillets and cutlets 
are removed and is best for soup or boiling. The shoulder and neck 
are also nice for stews or soup. The breast of veal is good for roast- 
ing, stewing and pies. It can be boned, then rolled, or a large hole 
may be cut in it for stuffing. 



MEATS. 71 

Pork. 

The loin or rib is the best part for roasting. The lean meat 
must be fine-grained, and the fat and lean very white. The shoulder 
is cheaper than the loin and is not as wasteful. The ham is nice 
for roasting if from small, young pork. The rib pork chops are the 
sweeter, but the loin chops are the more economical. 

The tenderloin is cut from the inside of the loin and may be 
used as a roast or for broiling. 

Ham. 

■ The best hams, whether fresh, or cured ami smoked, are those 
from 8 to 15 pounds in weight, having a thin skin, solid fat and a 
small, short, tapering leg or shank. 

Tongues. 
Beef, calf, lamb, sheep and pig's tongues are used. Calf's 
tongue is considered the best, although lamb's tongue is very nice. 
Choose those which are thick, firm and have plenty of fat on the 
under side. In buying salt tongue, select one with a smooth skin, 
which denotes that it is young and tender. 

Sweet Breads. 

Sweetbreads, if properly cooked, make one of the most de- 
licious dishes that can be served. There are two kinds, one found 
in the throat of the calf (when fresh it is plump, white and fat, of 
an elongated form); the other, the heart sweetbread, which is finer 
than the throat sweetbread, is attached to the last rib and lies 
near the heart. The form is rather round and it is firm and 
smooth. The color should be clear and a shade darker than the fat. 

In roasting meats allow from 15 to 20 minutes to the po.und, 
according to the thickness of the roast. The oven should be too 
hot to hold the hand in for only a moment when the meat is first 
put into it. This crisps the surface and sears the pores of the roast, 
thereby preventing the escape of the juices. The choicest roast 
can be absolutely ruined by a cool oven. After preparing the 
roast for the oven and placing in dripping pan do not put water in 
the pan, as it prevents the desired crispness and destroys the fla- 
vor of a roast. Baste it thoroughly before placing in the oven 
with butter or suet fat, afterwards basting frequently with its own 
drippings, which always makes it more tender. If it is necessary 
to add water, do not put it in pan until the meat has been in the 



72 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

oven about half an hour, or until it begins to brown, and then 
only a very little of hot water and butter. 

All meats should be seasoned when partly cooked, as the salt 
toughens the meat and draws out the juices. 

Mutton, lamb, veal and pork should be cooked more slowly 
and thoroughly than beef, with a moderate fire. 

In roasting veal, some cooks put in half a cup of boiling water 
and butter when placing it in oven. 

Fresh meat for boiling or stewing should be put into boiling 
water and closely covered, as it thus retains its flavor. Boil slowly 
about 20 minutes to each pound, salting when it begins to get tender. 

Salt meats should be covered with cold water and require 
about 30 minutes to the pound of very slow, steady boiling. Al- 
ways pour ofT the first water and add another of boihng water. 

Boihng meats should simmer continually and be replenished 
with boiling water until thoroughly cooked. 

In broihng steaks or chops have a very hot fire or pan. Turn 
often in order to keep the juices in. It also increases its tenderness. 
Never pierce the lean part of any meat with a fork, as that allows 
the juices to escape.

"Some hae meat that canna eat 
And some wad eat that want it 
But we hae meat and we can eat, 
Sae let the Lord be thankit." 

— Burns. 

BEEF. 

Prime Roast Beef. 

The first seven ribs are best. Have the chime removed, and 
ribs sawed about an inch long. Lay in a dry roast pan; sprinkle 
plentifully with salt and pepper, and place in hot oven, allowing 
15 minutes to the pound. Do not add water, nor turn the roast 
over. When done, remove the roast and drain the grease from 
roast pan. Put a quart of water in pan, let it boil; then stir 1 table- 
spoon flour in water, and add while boiling, for gravy. 

— Mrs. Thompson. 

Fillet of Beef. 

Strip it of all fat, scrape and wipe; then rub with red pepper 
and salt; juice of 2 lemons; 1 glass of Sherry wine. Put in baking 
pan with a little butter for basting and bake % of an hour for a 



J

5 pound fillet. Baste thoroughly with the butter. Put sprigs of 
parsley, pieces of celery, 1 small onion into the pan when you baste 
the meat. 

— Mrs. Anna Gustafson. 

Braised Beef. 

Wipe and trim 6 pounds round or rump of beef without bone, 
sear brown on all sides in very hot frying pan over a hot fire. In 
braising pan or iron kettle put layers of sliced onions, turnips and 
carrots; add a bunch of sweet herbs, 1 teaspoon salt, 3^ teaspoon 
pepper. On this lay meat. Add 1 pint boiling water (or water 
and stewed tomatoes), cover closely and cook 4 hours in a mod- 
erate oven. If water evaporates rapidly, add more. Transfer meat 
to hot platter. Strain, thicken and season gravy. The vegetables 
may be served separately if desired. 

— Miss C. A. Williams 

Braised Beef, en Casserole. 

Brown every side of a 4-pound piece of round steak in fat, in a 
hot frying pan. Then fry in the pan 1 sliced onion; 1 carrot; 1 
stalk celery, (diced) ; a small turnip, (diced) ; a sprig of parsley, 
chopped fine; a quarter of a bay leaf and 1 minced pimento. Place 
part of the vegetables under the meat and part around the side of 
it. Add }/2 cup of strained tomato and 1 cup hot water. Cover 
the casserole and bake 4 hours. 

— Mrs. Edward M. Heiliger. 

Porter-House Steak with Mushrooms. 
Have frying pan hot. Lay on steak, and watch carefully not 
to let it burn. When brown on one side, turn and brown on the 
other. Have no grease or butter in the pan. Heat platter, and 
lay on your steak, covering with the following: Place 2 table- 
spoons butter in sauce-pan, let it melt; add tablespoon flour, stir 
over the fire until smooth; then add 1 cup milk, 1 small can mush- 
rooms with their liquor and let it come to a boil. Pour over your 
steak, garnish with parsley and sliced lemon, serving hot. This 
is delicious. 

— Mrs. Thompson. 

Spanish Steak. 

Take a round of steak, fry it brown in plenty of butter, lift 
out of skillet and put in a baking pan. Sprinkle with salt and pep- 
per and fry a sliced onion brown in the butter remaining in the fry-

ing pan. Spread onion over the steak and cover it with half a can 
tomatoes, juice and all; cover pan and bake 1 hour in a slow oven, 
basting frequently. Make a gravy of drippings remaining in the 
pan and serve piping hot. — Mrs. Chandler Starr. 

Planked Steak. 

Rub a sirloin steak, cut about 2 inches thick, with lemon juice 
and butter. Place on a plank, which has been heated through in 
the oven. Put in a very hot oven. After 10 or 12 minutes cooking, 
turn the steak and return to the oven for another 10 minutes cook- 
ing. Garnish with parsley, latticed potatoes and little string beans. 
The steak must be served on the plank, which can rest on a large 
tray. The plank must always be thoroughly heated through be- 
fore the meat is placed upon it, and until it has been used 3 or 4 
times will have to be brushed with melted butter. 

— Mrs. a. E. Henry. 

Steak Smothered in Mushrooms. 
Place porter-house steak in smoking hot pan, sear quickly on 
both sides; remove to slower fire until done to suit taste. Place 
on hot platter. Put a tablespoonful or more of butter in frying 
pan, brown shghtly; add can of mushrooms; heat thoroughly; 
thicken with a little flour and pour over and around steak. Serve 
very hot. —Mrs. M. A. F. 

Beefsteak and Oysters. 
Broil porter-house steak the usual way; put 1 quart oysters 
with very little of the liquor into a stew-pan upon the fire, and 
when it comes to a boil take off the scum that may rise. Stir in 
3 ounces butter, mixed with a tablespoon of sifted flour; let boil 1 
minute, until it thickens. Pour it over the steak. Serve hot. 

—A. B. W. 

Round Steak. 

Take round steak, cut in inch squares; roll in flour and brown 
nicely in butter or suet drippings. Add water to cover, pepper and 
salt to taste. Let boil slowly for 1 hour until tender. It makes 
a nice brown gravy. Then cook peas, beans, carrots and new pota- 
toes (separately) ; season to taste. When ready to serve, put meat 
in center of platter and the vegetables separately around the meat. 
Then pour the gravy over meat and serve. This makes a very 
pretty and appetizing dish. — Mrs. A. E. Henry.

Pressed Beef. 

First have your beef nicely pickled; let it stay in pickle a week. 
Take the thin flanky pieces, put on a large potful, boil until per- 
fectly clone; then pull to pieces; season as you do souse, pepper, 
salt and allspice. Put in a coarse cloth and press down upon it 
some very heavy weight. 

California Sparrows. 

Take round steak cut thin. Cut up into pieces 4 inches square. 
Cut up bacon and onions in very small pieces and spread a layer 
of the mixture on each piece of steak, seasoning well with salt and 
pepper. Roll each piece tightly and hold together with wooden 
tooth-picks. Fry out bacon fat, add a little butter and brown 
each piece quickly in an iron kettle. Add a little hot water and a 
sliced onion. Cover with a closefitting lid and simmer slowly un- 
til tender, adding hot water as needed. 

— Anna Nelson Reck. 

English Beefsteak Pie. 

Cut round of beef in 2 inch squares. Take an earthen jar, put

POULTRY AND GAME. 95 



CHAPTER VIII. 



POULTRY AND GAME. 



"The cackling of geese saved the city of Rome; 
May all these recipes keep peace in the home." 

By the word game is meant all animals and birds which have 
never been domesticated and are proper to be eaten — from the 
little quail, prairie chicken and other birds to the roe, deer and 
other hoof-footed species. The flesh of wild animals has an aroma 
more marked than that of the tame ones. 

How to Choose Poultry. 

The age of the poultry is the principal thing. The best chick- 
ens are plump on the breast, fat on the neck, with smooth yellow 
legs, tender skin and the lower part of the breast bone pliable. A 
young turkey is known by its short spurs, dark and smooth legs. 
The age of the young duck may be ascertained by tearing the skin 
between the toes, if the skin tears, the duck is young. Geese may 
be know by taking the windpipe between two fingers and pressing 
it, and if young, a low crackling sound will be heard; also, if the 
thumb will easily press through the skin under the wing, the goose 
is young. 

Full grown fowls have the best flavor, providing they are 
young. Older poultry makes the best soup. Chickens with yellow 
skin and feet make the richest stews. All poultry and game should 
hang at least 24 hours in a cool place after they are killed, before 
cooking. Flesh of game is tough when first killed, it is more tender 
if kept sometime, or if frozen. 

How to Kill Poultry. 

Chickens and turkeys are killed either by chopping off the 
head or cutting the artery on the neck. After poultry is killed, hang 
it up by the feet and as soon as the bleeding stops pick off the feath- 
ers, while yet warm, and then singe. Geese and ducks are killed by 
taking the fowl under the left arm, holding the bill in the left hand, 
then stabbing it on top of the head; liold the fowl in this position 



96 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

letting the blood run into, a dish. When the blood stops running 
hold a red hot iron on the place where it is stabbed; this is done to 
prevent any blood from dropping on the feathers; then pick the 
feathers and singe the fowl. 

Feathers from geese, ducks, prairie hens, pigeons and birds of 
all kinds are always picked off dry — chickens only should be scalded. 

Drawing Poultry. 

Cut off the feet at the first joint, then the head and half the 
neck; cut the skin on the back of the neck down to the back of the 
wing. Detach the skin from the neck and draw the skin down over 
the breast, then cut off the rest of the neck close to the body, re- 
move the crop and windpipe, break the ligaments that hold the 
internal organs to the breastbone, then cut an opening below the 
breastbone down to the vent. Put the hand in the opening and 
carefully work it around until the top of the breastbone is reached, 
and draw out all the organs at once. Close to the ribs will be found 
a pinky substance called the lungs, or lights, remove these. 
Cut out the vent and the oil bag on the tail, then wash the fowl 
quickly inside and out with cold water. Cut the gizzard open, re- 
move the thick inside skin and carefully remove the gall bag from 
the liver. 

In shipping fowls frequently the intestines have not been re- 
moved and if such is the case, in washing the fowl, add a half tea- 
spoonful of baking soda, which will sweeten and render all the more 
wholesome. 

The giblets are the gizzard, heart, liver and neck. 

In roasting or boiling any fowl, ti'uss it, which means, to draw 
the thighs close to the body across the legs at the tail and tie firmly 
to the body with twine which is removed before serving, or pass 
the legs through a slit near the tail and skewer the wings close to 
the body. 

Carving. 

"Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods. 
Not hew him as a carcass fit for the hounds." 

— Shakespeare. 

A few simple rules are to be observed in carving birds. Plunge 
the fork upright into the very center of the breastbone and keep 
it there until the bird is dissected and served. Remove the legs 
first between the thigh and body until the bone is reached, then 
the thigh is forced back and the joint laid open, then remove the 



POULTRY AND GAME. 97 

leg with the point of the knife. Remove the w'ngs taking a part 
of the breast with it, the breast then can be sliced. 

Pigeons, quails and other birds of the same size are split 
lengthwise into halves. 



CHICKEN. 

Giblet Broth. 

Pour boiling water over the chicken feet, take them out and 
remove the skin and nails and place them with the giblets. Cover 
with cold water, add teaspoonful of salt, 1 small onion and boil until 
tender. This broth can be used for basting any roasted or fried fowl. 

Chicken, Roasted Plain. 

Singe, draw and wipe dry a young chicken; season with salt 
inside and out, then spread butter over the breast and place the 
chicken in the roasting pan, breast down. Lay thin slices of lard- 
ing pork over the back. Set the pan in a medium hot oven and 
roast until the chicken has become a fine brown color all over; 
baste frequently with the giblet broth, which has been added to 
the pan. 

Chicken Roasted, with Giblet Forcemeat. 

Prepare chicken same as for chicken roasted plain. Chop the 
raw giblets as fine as possible, soak half a loaf of stale bread 10 
minutes in cold water, then put it in a napkin and press the water 
out. Fry 1 finely chopped onion in a tablespoon of butter, with- 
out browning; then add the bread and stir and cook 5 minutes. 
Remove from the fire and when c '1 add the chopped giblets, 2 
whole eggs, 1 teaspoon salt, ^^ teaspoon pepper, 3^ teaspoon grated 
nutmeg, 1 teaspoon thyme, and mix well together. Fill the chicken, 
sew it up, truss it nicely and finish as per recipe above. 

Chicken Roasted, with Oyster Forcemeat. 

Prepare chicken same as for chicken roasted plain. Chop fine, 
10 large oysters; 1 cupful oyster liquor; 13^2 cups of rolled crackers; 
yolk of 1 egg and 1 whole egg; even teaspoon salt; Yi teaspoon pep- 
per; tablespoon melted butter; 3^ tablespoon chopped parsley. Mix 
all together and use as directed above. 



98 THE MENDKLSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Chicken Roasted with Plain Dressing. 
Prepare chicken same as for chicken roasted plain. Soak half 
a loaf stale bread 10 minutes in cold water, place in napkin and press 
the water out. Fry 2 tablespoons of finely chopped onion with 2 
tablespoons butter, without browning; add the bread and cook 5 
minutes. When cold, add an even teaspoon of salt, a little pepper, 
teaspoon of thyme, 2 eggs, and mix all together, and use as directed 

above. 

Another bread dressing is to remove the crust from a small 
loaf of bread and crumble it up into small crumbs, season with salt, 
pepper, sage and butter; mix well together and use as directed above. 

Chicken En Casserole. 

Take spring chicken, cut up; put in casserole with 1 piece of 
butter on each piece of chicken; cover casserole and bake in hot 
oven 1 hour. Scoop five potatoes into balls with vegetable scoop 
and fry in deep fat. Remove chicken from casserole; add potatoes 
to gravy, also chopped chives, red and black pepper, salt, chopped 
parsley, 2 or 3 tablespoons of kitchen bouquet and twice the amount 
of boiling water. Put the chicken in the gravy, baste with the gravy 
and put in the oven to reheat. Serve from casserole. 

— Mrs. Webb Stevens. 

Chicken, En Casserole, with Celery. 
Heat 3 tablespoons of butter or drippings in a frying pan and 
fry in it until a light brown, a thinly sliced onion. Disjoint a ten- 
der chicken weighing 4 or 5 pounds, roll the pieces in flour and fry 
them in the fat in the pan until a nice brown. Heat a large casserole 
in the oven and place in it a cup of diced celery. Place the chicken 
on top of the celery, pour over it 13^ cups water which you have 
heated to the boiling point in the pan in which you fried the chicken; 
add 1 teaspoon salt, cover the dish tightly and bake in a moderate 
oven 2 hours. 

— Mrs. Edward M. Heiliger. 

Chicken Pot Pie. 

Cut chicken as for frying. Yolks of 4 hard boiled eggs; 1 tea- 
cup minced salt pork; butter; pepper; salt; flour. Good sized kettle 
which will go in oven. Make biscuit dough as follows: 1 quart 
flour, 2 heaping teaspoons baking powder; put baking powder in

very lightly, until mixture seems like flour; add salt. Have 1 pint 



POULTRY AND GAME. 99 

milk and water mixed {% milk to ^ water), put into flour and mix 
thoroughly. Work dough lightly until perfectly smooth, roll as 
thin as for pie crust, taking 3^< of dough and rolling into a circular 
piece. Cut in quarters, and after greasing kettle all over, line sides 
with the dough putting points down and corners at top touching, 
the lower corners coming to within an inch of bottom of kettle. 
Cover bottom of kettle with thin layer of minced pork, then a layer 
of chicken (uncooked), pepper, salt, bits of butter, 2 egg yolks 
crumbled fine, a thin sprinkle of flour. Take dough which was left 
and after cutting a piece large enough for top crust, use the re- 
mainder for dumphngs, rolling as thin as possible. Cut into strips 
about 3 inches wide, then across in pieces about 2 inches wide. 
Cover the layer of chicken with some of these. Put on another thin 
layer of pork and proceed as at first, until all is in kettle. Roll out 
top crust as for pie and cut slits in top. Put it on the pie and lay 
top edges of lining dough down over top crust. Pour in through 
slit in top, boiling water until it covers top crust; cover, set on slow 
fire, and boil 2 hours. Put in oven 3^ hour before serving, in order 
to brown the top. 

— Miss Winnifred Ohr, St. Paul, Minn. 

Chicken Pie. 

Take a fat chicken and cut into pieces; stew until tender, add- 
ing salt. Make a biscuit dough; put chicken into a deep pan with 
plenty of broth; sprinkle in a handful of flour and add pepper and 
salt, if necessary. Wet the edge of the pan and cover the top with 
biscuit dough 1% of an inch thick, cutting a slit in the center for 
steam to escape. Bake in a moderately hot oven. 

Stewed Chicken with Salt Pork. 

Cut up chicken as for frying; dice a pound salt pork, place in 
a kettle, add chicken and brown slightly. Add hot water enough 
to cover well; boil until tender; skim occasionally. When this is 
done have ready some baking powder biscuits, split them open 
and place on a platter, putting the chicken in the center. Thicken 
the gravy with flour and pour over chicken and biscuits. 

Southern Chicken Pie. 

Select a yellow Philadelphia fowl weighing 4 or 5 pounds; clean 
carefully, singe, and put it on in boiling water enough to cover it 
and let it simmer gently until it begins to grow tender. Save this 
broth with the giblets. Now cut the chicken in small pieces; slice 



100 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

a quarter of a pound of fat pork very thin and fry it with the 
chicken until it is brown. After the chicken and pork are fried 
take them up and stir into the pan in which they were cooked a 
tablespoon of flour. Stir it over the fire until brown; then add a 
pint of the chicken broth, a teaspoon of salt, 34 teaspoon of pepper. 
Stir this gravy until it has boiled 2 minutes and use it for pie. To 
make the crust: Mix together in a bowl with a knife 1 pound of 
flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, 2 teaspoons of butter, and just enough cold 
water to hold it together. Roll it out about an inch thick; cut a 
quarter of a pound of butter in large slices, and lay it all over the 
paste; fold it up and wrap in a floured towel and put in the ice box 
for half an hour. Roll it out, repeating same with another quarter 
of a pound of butter; roll it to a thickness of Y2 inch, fold it in 3 
thicknesses and roll it out again. If the butter breaks through, 
fold it again in a towel and cool for half an hour before using. Line 
a deep dish; then put in alternate layers of chicken, pork, and 
sliced raw potatoes; pour in as much gravy as the dish will hold. 
Sprinkle with a little chopped parsley, a dash more of pepper and 
salt, and cover with a top crust, wetting the edges to make them 
adhere. Cut a hole in the top to allow the steam to escape. 

— May Irwin. 

Spring Chicken Fried. 

Have a spring chicken cut into 6 pieces; season M^ell with salt 
and pepper; put a pound fine cut salt pork over the fire and fry to a 
light brown; add 1 tablespoon of butter. Put in chicken and fry 
over slow fire to light brown, then add y^ cup giblet broth, cover 
pan and cook until tender. After removing chicken, thicken gravy 
with 2 tablespoons of flour and 13^ cups of giblet broth and 1 cup 
of milk and cook until thick. 

Another way is to chop the giblets fine, add them to gravy; 
lay the chicken on buttered toast, pour gravy over them; sprinkle 
1 fine chopped, hard boiled egg over it and garnish with water-cress 
or parsley. 

Spring Chicken Deviled.

Make gravy as above if desired. 

Spring Chicken Broiled. 

Spht a spring chicken through the back; crack the bones be- 
tween the first and second joints and fry nicely; brush over 
with melted butter; lay on a broiler over a moderate clear

then mix 2 tablespoons of butter with 1 tablespoon of salt, J^ tea- 
spoon of pepper; spread this on both sides all over the chicken and 
garnish with water-cress or parsley. 

Chicken Fillet — How to Prepare for Entrees. 

Remove the skin from the breast of a young plump chicken so 
that the fillet will lay bare; make an incision on top of the breast 
bone from end to end, then with a small knife cut off the entire 
breast from each side, including the small wing bone. Under each 
breast will be found a small fillet which is called the mignon; care- 
fully remove it, pare off the thin white skin which covers the fillets 
and the mignon, then lay them in a buttered pan and cover with 
buttered paper and set in cool place until wanted. 

Chicken Fillet a la Toulouse. 

Mix 1 tablespoon of salt with 3^ teaspoon of white pepper; 
sprinkle it over the fillets and mignons of 3 chickens. Make 6 in- 
cisions on top of each mignon, then cut 4 truffles into slices; cut 
each slice into 3 strips, then insert in each incision of the mignon 
a strip of truffle; lay 1 mignon on top of each fillet lengthwise. 
Place 4 tablespoons of butter into a pan and as soon as melted re- 
move it, then put in the fillets and baste them with the melted but- 
ter. Cover with buttered paper and put them in a medium hot 
oven and bake about 15 minutes. In the meantime brown 2 table-

the bones and put them back in the liquor; cook 30 minutes and 
remove bones. Dice the chicken, except the giblets; add to liquor 
with Y2 can tomatoes, or 6 whole ones, 6 onions, salt, pepper, a little 
sugar, tablespoon of butter and stew until done. Have ready 
slices of buttered toast and pour over the toast; serve hot. 



Boiled Chicken with Oyster Sauce. 

Select a plump, fat year-old-chicken weighing about 5 or 6 
pounds; remove carefully all the fat possible; a fat fowl is the most 
tender, but if the fat is cooked in it, the flesh will have a strong 
taste. Prepare a dressing by using a pint of stale soft bread crumbs, 
taken from the inside of a loaf of bread, salt to taste, a pinch of 
cayenne, a pint of small 03^sters, a large teaspoon of butter and 1 
egg. Mix this well and dress the fowl. Rub a thick cloth with 
butter, then dredge it with flour and sew the fowl up in the cloth 
and plunge it into boiling water; then set the kettle where it will boil 
rapidly for 10 minutes; then let it simmer for 2 to 2Yi. hours; then 
remove from the cloth and serve with oyster sauce. Save the water 
in which the chicken was boiled for cream sauce. 

— Mrs. John Keller, Toronto, Can. 

Curried Chicken. 

Boil 1 chicken; then remove it from the liquor and remove the 
skin and pick meat off bones, and cut into inch squares; return to 
liquor; add 2 cans mushrooms, halved; thicken with enough flour 
so the gravy will be a little thicker than for ordinary gravy, then 
add 1 tablespoon of curry powder, salt, paprika, and celery salt. 

— Mrs. Fred Moffatt. 



Chicken Chop Suey. 

Boil 1 chicken and pick it off the bones. In another dish boil

give vegetables a nice color, without thinning too much; when ten- 
der, add the cut up chicken, also 1 can small mushrooms, and sea- 
son very highly with salt and paprika. Serve hot on a large chop 
platter with a border of boiled rice, chop suey in the center. 

— Mrs. Homer St. John. 



POULTRY AND GAME, 103 

Chicken Croquettes I. 

One chicken weighing 3 pounds; 1 pair sweetbreads; 2 onions 
sHced and fried in butter until brown; 3^ teacup sweet thick cream; 
3^2 teacup broth; 3^ salt spoon of mace; little red pepper to taste. 
Cook and chop chicken fine; add sweetbreads and onions chopped. 
Mix all ingredients; place in a sauce pan over the fire until it comes 
to a boil. Take 1 teaspoon of flour, moisten with chicken broth, stir 
into the boiling mixture. After a few moments remove from the 
fire and set to cool. When cold, add 1 well beaten egg; then take 
out on bread board in a large oval spoon a croquette portion, roll 
in cracker dust, drop into boiling lard, take out, and drain on a 
piece of linen. Place on hot platter and garnish with parsley. 

— May Irwin. 



Chicken Croquettes II. 

One large chicken; 2 sets calves brains, boiled; 1 small cup 
suet, chopped fine; 2 sprigs parsley, chopped; 1 nutmeg, grated; 
1 tablespoon onion after it is chopped very fine; 1 lemon; the juice 
and grated rind; 1 teaspoon salt; paprika and red pepper to 
taste. Cut up and cook the chicken thoroughly; when done, take 
out of the kettle, skin and put through a meat grinder while hot. 
Put the stock away to cool. Add brains and other ingredients; 
skim the greese off the jellied stock and add; also add a little cream 
until the mixture is very soft. Set away for a while, then mould 
into croquettes, dip into beaten egg and roll in bread or 
cracker crumbs and fry in hot lard in a wire basket. This 
will make about 25 croquettes. Some people prefer rice in- 
stead of the brains. When rice is used, take 13^ cups boiled rice 
and mix with the chicken while still very hot. 

The secret of good croquettes is to have them very soft and 
fluffy on the inside, made so by stock and cream. Mix them as 
moist as it is possible to handle them and let stand awhile after 
they are dipped in egg and rolled in cracker crumbs. 

■ — Mrs. Chandler Starr. 

Creamed Chicken. 

Melt 3^ cup of butter; stir into it half a cup of flour, half a tea- 
spoon of paprika and a teaspoon of salt, add 1 quart rich milk and 
stir constantly until the sauce is smooth and boihng. Then add 5 
cups of cooked chicken, diced. This will serve 8 or 10.

half teaspoon of salt and a dash of paprika; stir until very hot, 
then stir in the beaten yolks of 3 eggs boiled with a cup of cream. 
Be sure the water in the lower pan is boiling. Serve as soon as it 
thickens, because if cooked too long, it will curdle. 

Jellied Chicken. 

Cut up chicken as for stewing; put it in a dish and place in a 

steamer and steam until tender. Skim fat off chicken, season with 

salt and take from fire; remove bones and skin and shred into

TURKEY. 

Turkey Roasted, Plain. 

Pluck the bird carefully and singe; break the leg bone close 
to the body; hang up the bird and draw out the tendons from the 
legs (all good butchers will do this if asked). Make a small sHt 
down the back of the neck and take out crop, then cut the neck 
bone close. After the bird is stuffed the skin can be turned over 
the back and the crop will look full and round. Cut around the 
vent, making the opening as small as possible, and draw carefully. 
Boil the giblets for the gravy. Wash the turkey, dry, salt thor- 
oughly inside and out and fill with dressing. Sew up the opening 
at the vent, tie the legs and wings, rub the turkey well on the out- 
side with butter and place in the oven until it is nicely browned; 
then remove and cover the back and sides with a paste made from 
flour and water; return to covered pan, breast side down; add 
about a cup of hot water; cover and bake slowly until tender. 

Chestnut Dressing. 

Peel a good sized challot, put in a sauce pan with 1 tablespoon 

of butter and heat without browning. Add 34 pound of sausage 

meat, cook little longer, then add 10 finely chopped mushrooms, 

12 well pounded, cooked, peeled chestnuts and mix well together; 



106 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

then season with salt, pepper and a little thyme and parsley. Let 
this come to a boil, then add 3^ ounce fresh bread crumbs, 24 whole 
cooked and shelled French chestnuts and mix well together, be- 
ing careful not to break the chestnuts. Let cool and stuff the 
turkey. 

Sage Dressing. 

Soak a loaf of stale bread, without the crust, 10 minutes in 
cold water; then press out all the water through a cloth. Cook, 
without browning, 8 tablespoons chopped onion, in 1 tablespoon of 
butter; add this to the bread, then add 8 tablespoons of sausage 
meat, half tablespoon salt, half teaspoon pepper, teaspoon of sage 
and 2 whole eggs. Mix all well together and use as directed in 
former recipe. 

Creole Dressing for Turkey. 

Save the blood from the turkey. Cook giblets in as little 
water as possible until tender and then chop fine. Cook 3 cups 
rice in 6 cups salted water. Cut fine, small bunch tender green 
onion tops and parsley. Chop fine 2 large onions and fry (not 
brown) in 5 or more tablespoons melted fat. To this add the cooked 
rice, giblets and water in which they were boiled, onion tops and 
parsley, then the blood. Stir until the blood is thoroughly mixed. 
Season highly with red and black pepper, salt and a pinch of sage; 
cook until blood has changed color, stirring mixture all the time. 
Stuff turkey with this as you would bread dressing. 3 or 4 dozen 
oysters added the last thing before stuffing turkey is very nice. 

— Mrs. Montou, Jennings, La. 

Roast Turkey with Sausage. 

Stuff the turkey with rich dressing. When done, turn out on 
a platter, surround it with small fried sausages and chestnuts 
cooked in broth, and serve with a well thickened giblet sauce. 

Braised Turkey. 

Truss and stuff as for roasting, using a forcemeat made of 
mushrooms and sweetbreads in addition to the bread. Lard the 
breast with salt pork, place the turkey in a stew pan, breast upper- 
most, with sliced vegetables, and water to cover. Set it on the top 
of the stove and as soon as it begins to boil put it in the oven and 
bake slowly until done. 



POULTRY AND GAME. 107 

Boiled Turkey with Oyster Sauce. 

Prepare in the same manner as for roasting; fill with the oyster 
dressing (for oyster dressing recipe see "Boiled Chicken with Oyster 
Dressing"), tie legs and wings close to the body, place in boiling 
water that has been well salted, breast down. Skim often, let it 
boil until done, being careful to avoid skin being broken. Serve 
with celery or oyster sauce. 

Boned Turkey. 

Very difficult, but very nice. Clean the fowl as usual; have a 
very sharp pointed knife; begin at the end of the wing, pass the knife 
down close to the bone, cut all the flesh from the bone, leaving the 
skin whole. Pass the knife down each side of the breast bone, and 
up the legs keeping close to the bone. Split the back half way up 
and carefully draw out the bones. Fill these places with the stuff- 
ing, restoring the fowl to its natural form; then sew up all the incis- 
ions made in the skin. Lay a few strips of salt pork on the top, 
and roast, basting often with salt and water and a little butter. 
Add a glass of port wine to the gravy. When serving, carve across 
the fowl in slices. 

GEESE OR DUCKS.

108 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

tablespoons sugar; cover and cook until apples are done. Remove 
from fire and when cold, add 2 cups rolled zwie back, or toast, 
and 1 egg. In sewing up a goose after filling, stitch very closely so 
that the fat will not get in. 

Goose Stuffed with Sauer Kraut. 

After goose is cleaned and wiped dry, fill it with sauer kraut; 
sew it up and tie in shape. Place in a large kettle, put 2. quarts 
sauer kraut over it and cover all with boiling water. Let simmer

and boil, skimming it carefully, until broth looks clear, then add 
the vegetables and spices, lemon and vinegar. Boil until goose is 
well done. Strain liquor through a flannel bag to cool. (It must 
taste spicy). Pick the meat off the bones, skim all fat off liquor 
and pour over meat and set aside in cool place to jelly. 

In selecting ducks for roasting remember 2 small young ones 
are better than a large drake. If buying a farm-yard duck, shut 
them up 2 or 3 days and feed on barley meal and water to cleanse 
them thoroughly. 

A recipe suitable for goose is equally as good for duck. 

Pigeons and Capon. 

A recipe that is suitable for chicken is equally as good for 
pigeons and capons. 

Pigeon en Casserole with Asparagus. 

Truss 4 or 5 pigeons, cleaned as for roasting. Saute in butter 
and put in casserole and cover closely. Cook an onion and 2 young 
carrots, shced thin, in 2 tablespoons butter; add 13^ cups boiling 
water and 3^ teaspoon salt, pour over the pigeons, cover and cook 
until pigeons are tender. Strain off broth, thicken with butter and

Swedish Fried Chicken or Squab. 

Cut the chicken in pieces; brown each piece quickly 
in butter in an iron kettle (an iron kettle is necessary to use with 
this recipe). When all the pieces are browned place back in kettle, 
season to taste with salt and pepper; add 1 teacup hot water; cover 
with tight fitting lid. Allow the chicken to simmer slowly until 
tender, adding small quantity of hot water from time to time as 
may be required. For the gravy add flour slowly, stirring with a 
Swedish straw wisp, then add 1 cup cream and sufficient hot water 
to give proper consistency.

with a piece of onion and put a piece of butter into each squab. 
Put into a baking pan and add the stock, salt and pepper and bake 
in a quick oven 45 minutes, basting frequently. When the birds 
go to the oven, put the livers and hearts on to boil. Bake and 
place the squabs on buttered toast, and into pan put 1 tablespoon 
butter and brown; add 1 tablespoon flour and the livers and hearts 
mashed fine. Mix all well together with \^ pint stock, stirring con- 
stantly until it boils. Add salt and pepper and pour over squab. 

Mrs. George D. Roper. 

GAME. 

Wild ducks have a strong, fishy flavor. In order to remove this 
flavor, the ducks should be picked, singed and drawn and thor- 
oughly washed inside and outside in cold water. Cover them with 
boiling water to which has been added 1 tablespoon soda, 1 carrot 
and 2 onions. Boil 3^ hour; take ducks out and put in cold water; 
then wipe dry, season and stuff with any preferred dressing. Rub 
breasts with butter and place salt pork over them and bake in 
moderate oven until brown. Baste often with water that has a 
little onion in it and melted butter. 

Fillets of Teal Ducks a la Pontchatrain. 

Lift the breasts of fine plump birds, leaving skin on and score 
lightly. Marinate these in olive oil, in which has been incorporated 
cut chives or young onion tops, parsley leaves, salt beignonette 
and lemon juice. Let them remain for 2 hours and when ready to 



110 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

serve, pour a little oil in a sautair; make hot and put in the fillets. 
Brown nicely, but keep rare; remove and introduce enough "Espag- 
nos" into sautair for number of fillets. Remove from fire, add 
orange juice and strain. Arrange fillets in circle alternately with 
croutons of equal size and shape. Garnish to suit; pour sauce in 
center and serve. 

H. H. Havens, Steward, The Nelson. 

Wild goose may be prepared in the same way. 

Pheasants may be baked same as chicken. 

Prairie Chicken. 

After cleaning and drying thoroughly, stuff with any desired 
dressing and truss. Put in dish and steam until tender, then dredge 
with flour and rub butter over breasts and place in oven to brown, 
basting often with liquor in steamer, or with water. Serve with 
apple sauce or currant jelly. — Mrs. Thomas Weldon. 

Prairie chickens, if young, are also good fried like spring 
chicken. 

The skull of a young prairie chicken can be crushed by the 
pressure of the thumb. 

GROUSE. 

Season and truss a well cleaned and dried grouse; bake as any 
other fowl, basting often. When ready to serve, untruss the bird, 
dress then in bread croijtons and garnish with water cress. Add 
bouillon to the gravy, skim off the fat and pour over the bird. 

Smothered Birds. 

All small game birds are apt to be dry when fried or roasted, 
but if they are well seasoned and buttered, then smothered in rice 
they will be more juicy. Line a baking dish (individual dishes are 
nice) with boiled rice. Put in birds and cover with rice, press 
smoothly and pour over it water and butter, and bake until tender. 
If birds are old parboil them, using that liquor to moisten rice. 

Roast Partridge, Filled with Truffle Dressing. 

Pick, singe and draw 2 fine partridges; wipe out the inside; 
chop fine the 2 livers and 14, pound pork tenderloins, pound to a 
paste; add 6 fine cut truffles, season with salt and pepper; fry quar- 
ter of a pound of salt pork, add the other ingredients, stir for a few 
minutes over the fire; then fill the crop and body of the 2 partridges 
with this forcemeat, sew up and truss them nicely; lay the birds

in a pan, spread 2 tablespoons of butter over their breast and bake 
in a hot oven, basting frequently until done; then untruss remove 
the threads, lay the birds on two bread canapes. Add to the gravy 
1 tablespoon fine cut onions and carrots, and bay leaf, 12 whole 
peppers; cook 5 minutes; add 1 tablespoon flour, stir well; add 1 
pint broth and 1 teaspoon beef extract; boil; and if necessary, some 
salt; strain, and serve with the bird. 

QUAIL. 

Steamed and Creamed Quail. 

Place quail well salted in a dish and set in steamer; steam until 
tender. Use the liquor and rich milk to make a sauce, season to 
taste. Put quail on squares of toast and pour sauce over. 

Quails with Juniper Berries. 
Remove heads and feet from 6 fat quails, draw and wipe neatly. 
Crush a heaping tablespoon of sound, well dried juniper berries and 
place in a bowl with half a teaspoon of fresh butter; thoroughly 
mix, then take half of the mixture and divide equally among the 
6 quails, putting it inside of them. Truss, season with salt and 
pepper and set on a roasting tin with a thin slice of salt pork over 
each bird; set in the oven for 25 minutes, basting frequently; then 
discard the pork and untruss the birds. Set them in a cocotte dish 
over the fire and when thoroughly hot divide the rest of the butter 
into 6 parts, put it over the birds and send at once to the table in 
the cocotte. 

Quail a la Maitre d' Hotel. 

Split 6 quails through the back. Season with salt and pepper; 
brush each one with olive oil or butter. Broil for about 20 minutes, 
turning at least 4 times. In the meantime cream 4 tablespoons 
butter; add slowly 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon chop- 
ped parsley, half teaspoon nutmeg. Put the birds on well buttered 
toast and spread the Maitre d' Hotel butter over the birds and serve. 

Reed birds, woodcock and snipe can be prepared by any of 
the foregoing recipes. 

VENISON. 

The loin, haunch, leg or saddle may be roasted. A leg of veni- 
son may be boiled until tender and then browned on all sides. The 
meat from neck and shoulder is stewed. The best steaks are cut 
from the loin and should be broiled.

into cubes 1 inch square. Dice Y^ pound salt pork and fry, add 
meat and brown. Have twice the quantity of diced carrots, onions 
and potatoes as meat. About an hour before the meat is tender, 
add the vegetables. If the gravy is not thick enough, add a httle 
flour and water and season with salt and pepper. 

In preparing venison remove all the fat possible for it is very 
strong. 

HARES, RABBITS AND SQUIRRELS.

CHAPTER IX. 

VEGETABLES. 

"Nor lacked our table small parade of garden fruits." 

Summer Vegetables. 

Certain vegetables should always be boiled uncovered to pre- 
serve their color. This applies especially to string beans, green 
peas, spinach, sorrel and Brussels sprouts. If the water is very 
hard a teaspoonful of soda added to a gallon will be found a good 
proportion. 

Another important rule is to remove the vegetable from the 
fire and drain it the moment it is sufficiently cooked. Do not draw 
it aside and let it stand in the water or it will be quite spoiled. 

Too much stress cannot be laid on the rule to remove from' 
the fire and drain all vegetables thoroughly the moment they are 
cooked perfectly tender. Not only allow the water to run off, but 
press it out when possible, or place the colander on something 
over the fire that the water may be driven off by the heat. Or use 
any other device suggesting itself rather than let the vegetables 
remain wet and soggy. No amount of seasoning will give them 
the proper taste if they retain the water from the boiling. 

To avoid the unpleasant odor caused by cooking cabbage use 
a very large pot and do not fill too near the brim with the water, 
as it is the boiling over which causes the worst odor. Another way 
of overcoming the odor is to put into the water a piece of bread 
tied in a fine white rag. After it has been 15 minutes in the pot 
remove it and throw it immediately into the fire to burn, as in its 
turn it becomes very unpleasant. Still another method is to put 
a piece of charcoal in the water with the cabbage. 

In using milk for mashed potatoes, use it hot instead of cold. 
The result is better. Not everyone knows all vegetables that grow 
under the ground should be cooked in cold water.

Saratoga Potatoes. 

Slice very thin; put them in cold water for 2 hours, keeping 
cold; take out and dry them in towels; fry in deep fat until a light 
brown; drain off grease in colander and sprinkle salt over them. 

French Fried Potatoes. 

Pare and cut into strips lengthwise rather small potatoes; 
soak them in cold water; dry in towels and fry in deep fat. Drain 
and sprinkle salt on them. 

Escalloped Potatoes. 

Pare and cut potatoes in slices about a quarter inch thick. 
Butter a baking dish and put in a layer of potatoes, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper and dredge flour over them and put on little pieces 
of butter. Repeat this till the dish is ^ full and pour milk over 
nearly to the top of the potatoes. Bake about 13^ hours. 

Creamed Potatoes. 

One pint milk; 1 tablespoon flour; 2 tablespoons butter; 1 tea- 
spoon salt; 1 quart diced, cold boiled, or baked potatoes; 1 table- 
spoon chopped parsley. Melt butter in double boiler; add flour, 
milk, parsley, salt and a little pepper; heat through, then add the 
potatoes and cook 3 or 4 minutes. Cold baked potatoes have a 
better flavor than boiled for cream potatoes. 

Hashed Brown Potatoes.

Old Potatoes. 

Old potatoes, peeled and left lying in cold water for several 
hours, then wiped, rubbed all over in melted butter, and baked, 
are more mealy and delicious than the high priced new potato in 
the spring time of year. — C. C. C, Detroit, Mich. 

Rules for Cooking. 

Pare potatoes thin to save mineral matter. Boil potatoes 
slowly so they will not wear away. Bake potatoes rapidly. Let 
an old potato stand in cold water 1 hour before using. Never let 
a new potato stand in cold water before using. 

— Miss C. Harris. 

To Boil New Potatoes. 

These should never be peeled with a knife. Scrub and rub 
the skin until clean. Cover with boiling water and boil rapidly 
from 15 to 20 minutes with the cover on. Drain the potatoes; 
sprinkle with salt, and put back on the fire, uncovered, for a few 
minutes, to dry. Dish on a folded napkin and serve very hot. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Select for this purpose the largest and smoothest. Put them 
in a hot oven. They will require about 1 hour. After the first 20 
minutes open the oven door every little while, take each potato in 
a coarse cloth and press it all over. This will make them mealy. 

Glaced Sweet Potatoes. 

Take potatoes as nearly the size of an egg as possible, and bake 
until done. Pare off skin and cut in halves the long way. Put in 
bake pan, cut side down. Pour over this melted butter, and sprinkle 
with salt, pepper, brown sugar, and cracker or bread crumbs. Beat 
4 eggs until light, and pour over this, and bake in hot oven for 15 
minutes, until nicely brown, and then serve. 

— Mrs. H. C. Brown. 

Potato Au Gratin. 

Slice cold boiled potatoes. Make a cream sauce from 2 table- 
spoonfuls each of butter and flour, 1 level teaspoonful of salt, and 
one-eighth teaspoonful of pepper. Heat butter in saucepan and

Creamed New Potatoes with Parsley. 

Drop the potatoes into boiling water and cook until they can 
be pierced with a fine skewer. Do not use the tines of a fork, 
which would burst them. Neither should you expect them to be 
mealy, for in new potatoes the starch cells are not yet developed. 
Drain and arrange in a hot vegetable dish. To make the sauce^ 
put 2 level tablespoonfuls butter in a saucepan with 1 of flour. 
When melted and bubbly add a cup of thin cream and stir con- 
stantly until it boils and thickens. Then add a level teaspoonful 
salt, a dash of white or black pepper, as preferred, and a table- 
spoonful fine chopped parsley. Cook a moment longer and pour 
over the potatoes. 

Breaded Potatoes.

Sweet Potatoes — Southern Style. 

Choose plump, well ripened potatoes; pare them (raw); cut 
in 2 lengthwise pieces; season with salt and pepper. In a large 
flat bottomed sauce pan put 2 tablespoons butter and 1 of sugar. 
When hot, lay in enough potatoes to cover bottom of pan, closely; 
add boiling water enough to half cover them; place on back of 
stove where heat is gentle. Cook slowly for about an hour, turn- 
ing them once. By this time the water will have evaporated, leav- 
ing a little butter sauce to pour over dish in serving. 

Cold Boiled Potatoes. 

All potatoes which are to be boiled first and then dressed must 
be boiled in their skins and set away to get cold with their skins on. 
This applies especially to potatoes to be used in hashes. It makes 
a wonderful difference and should be observed; the potato is much 
easier to cut neatly and does not crumble to pieces in the cooking. 
For potato salad made of cold potatoes they should never be cooked 
in any other way. There is, however, a delicious potato salad 
made by dressing freshly boiled, hot, mealy potatoes. 

Potatoes Saute. 

Cut cold, boiled, peeled potatoes in sHces about one-sixth of an 
inch thick. The potatoes used should be rather small, and make a 
pint sliced. Heat a large lump of butter in a saucepan. Lay the 
potatoes in, cover and stew, not fry them, in the butter. There 
must be enough butter for each slice to get its coating and absorb 
as much as it will. Mince fine, enough parsley to make a heaping 
teaspoonful, also the same quantity of chervil if at hand. Stir it 
into the potatoes; add salt and pepper, and when they have cooked 
about 15 minutes, serve. They should not be allowed to crisp or 
brown. Shake the pan from time to time to prevent sticking or 
browning. New potatoes may be sauted in this manner, but should 
be kept whole. 

Fried Potato Hash. 

Having boiled and cooled potatoes with their skins on, peel 
and chop, not too fine. Melt in a frying pan a large lump of sweet 
drippings or butter, or both mixed. Quite a large tablespoonful 
of each will be required for an ordinary dish of potatoes. When 
the butter is hot lay in the potatoes. Sprinkle generously with 
pepper and salt. Take a long knife, and every minute or two run 
it under the potatoes, turning them up from the bottom. Be care- 
ful not to mash them. Fry until the edges are well browned and 
serve.

CHAPTER XII. 

PASTRY . 

''Who'll dare deny the truth, there's poetry in pie." 

It is quite essential in making good pastry that all utensils 
should be as cold as possible and as little water as possible should 
be used. Ice water or the very coldest obtainable should be used 
in mixing pastry. Pastry should b*e kneaded very slightly. The 
less it is handled the better. 

A small pinch of baking powder may be added to pie crust, 
if desired. A little white of egg spread over bottom crust of a pie 
before pouring in the filling will help to keep the crust from soaking. 

Pie crust will be browner and more flaky if about 13^ table- 
spoonfuls of cream or rich milk be spread over the surface before 
baking. 

Pie Crust I. 

Two cups flour; 1 cup lard; 3^ cup water; pinch of salt. Mix 
lard and flour thoroughly, add water little by little, press together 
lightly. — Mrs. G. L. Garlick. 

Pie Crust II. 

Three cups flour; 1 cup lard; 3^ cup ice water. Mix lard in 
flour with knife; add water and mix as little as possible; roll thin. 

Pie Crust III. 

One quart flour; 3^ pound of lard, sweet and firm; 3^ pound 
of butter; 1 small teacupful of ice water. 

— Mrs. C. I. Hardy. 

Pie Crust IV. 

One-half cup of butter; 3^ cup of lard; Yi cup of ice water; 
2Y2 cups of flour. Have everything cold. Cut the flour into the 
butter and lard with a knife and add the ice water, using the knife 
to mix. Roll as little as possible and in one direction. Do not put 
the hands in if possible to handle it with the knife. 

— Mrs. Seeley Perry.

in separately, until smooth. This nuiy be served with soup, by 
dropping from a spoon into deep fat frying until brown, or dropping

cream puffs, by dropping on buttered pans in circular forms, 
higher in the center. Bake 30 minutes in moderate oven with 
strongest heat at bottom, as pulfs nuist rise (piickly and be light 
before browning on top. They scorch easily, but nmst be well

CHAPTER XIII. 



HOT PUDDINGS. 



"The daintiest last to make the end more sweet." 

It is said, "One of the best uses of originahty is to say common 
things in an uncommon way." One of the next best uses is in serv- 
ing common things in uncommon ways for — "Variety ah^ne gives 
joy; the sweetest meats the soonest cloy." 

How to Insure the Best Results. 

Always butter pudding molds well. If the pudding is to be 
boiled in a mold, use a covered mold. Stand in boiling water and 
boil continuously until done. Have the water come up as high as 
the pudding in the mold. 

If a bag is used, it should be of thick cotton. Dip the bag in 
hot water and flour the inside well. Plunge immediately in hot 
water. When done, dip the bag in cold water and the pudding will 
turn out easily. Put a plate on the bottom of the kettle to keep 
the pudding from burning. 

When a pudding is to be steamed, have the pudding mold a 
little smaller round than the steamer used. Lay a cloth over the 
top of the steamer and cover steamer closel}'. Do not uncover the 
steamer or jar it till the pudding is done. 

In boiling or steaming puddings never allow the water to stop 
boiling till pudding is done. If more water has to be added it must 
be at the boiling point. 

When raisins are used in puddings, put them in dry and well 
floured. If put in wet, the pudding will be heavy.

CHAPTER XV. 



COLD DESSERTS. 



Suggestions. 

Milk is at a scald in a double boiler when bubbles form around 
the edge. 

A Httle salt should be added to all custards and it is an irh- 
provement to nearly all puddings. 

The dish containing souffles or custards should be set in a pan 
of hot water while baking. 

When a ring mold or a border mold is not available, a very 
good substitute is to place a basin or bowl inside of another, using 
the space between for a mold. When the mold is set the inner basin 
can be readily removed by pouring into it a httle hot water. 

When cream will not beat readily, often the white of an egg 
dropped into y^ pint cream will bring the desired result. 

When cream will not whip as stiff as desired, add a Httle dis- 
solved gelatine, cooled, and allow to stand for a while on ice. 

Never use gelatine with raw pineapple. It will no.t jelly. Raw 
pineapple juice cuts the gelatine. 

In case any kind of custard being cooked in a double boiler 
curdles, remove at once and set in cold water and beat with a dover 
egg beater. This will often recall it. 

Strawberries, cherries, currant clusters, and grapes are all 
pretty for garnishings. 

Fruits en perle are prepared by dipping them first in slightly 
beaten whites of eggs, then rolling in granulated sugar and allow- 
ing to dry. 

To glace fruits, boil sugar and water syrup till it ropes, then 
dip fruit in and allow to harden. 

Fruits may be also dipped in melted fondant, colored any de- 
sired shade.

CHAPTER XVII. 



CAKES, CAKE FILLINGS 
AND FROSTINGS, GINGERBREAD. 



General Directions for Cake Making. 

In baking a cake have all the necessary articles ready. But- 
ter the pan in which the cake is to be baked. Break the eggs, the 
3^olks in one bowl and the whites in another. Measure the sifted 
flour and sugar and set them aside, Then measure the milk or 
water to be used and the baking powder or soda, or cream of tartar. 
Sift the flour with the baking powder or whatever is to be used to 
lighten the cake. Have the fruit or nuts ready to add to the bat- 
ter when needed. When this is all done, cream the butter in your 
mixing bowl. A perforated spoon is the best to use for this. Then 
gradually beat in the sugar. If your recipe calls for yolks, beat 
them till light and thick, then add to the butter and sugar. Then 
add the liquid alternately with the flour. Lastly add the whites, 
beaten stiff. Fruit or nuts may now be added. If you flour the fruit 
before adding it to the batter, it will not sink to the bottom of the 
cake while baking. When putting the batter in the pan, it is a good 
plan to spread it away from the center towards the edges with a 
spoon so that the cake will be of a uniform height when baked. 

An entirely different method is used in mixing a sponge cake. 
First beat the yolks till thick and light colored. Gradually beat in 
the sugar and then add the flavoring, (grated rind of an orange or 
lemon) and lemon juice, if used. Then beat the whites till stiff. 
Add part of the whites to the yolks and sugar, then add part of the 
flour, then add the remaining whites and the rest of the flour. In 
making a sponge cake no stirring must be done. The lightness of 
the cake depends upon the air beaten into the eggs. The cake 
should be mixed entirely by cutting and folding. 

In baking a cake the oven should be at a temperature to raise 
the cake ,to its full height in one-fourth the time required for bak- 
ing. The cake should not brown during this time. During the 



232 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK, 

second quarter the cake should brown a very little. During the 
third quarter it should finish browning. The heat of the oven 
should be reduced during the last half of the time. Cakes in which 
butter has been used will separate from the sides of the pan when 
baked.

3^ cup butter (scant); 1 cup rich sour milk; 1 small teaspoon soda

heaping teaspoon ground cinnamon; 3^ teaspoon cloves (ground); 
3^ teaspoon of nutmeg or mace (ground) ; 1 large cup raisins, seeded, 
and cut in two with scissors (not chopped). Bake in a pan about 4 
inches deep in a very slow oven. This cake is very moist and keeps 
so for a long time.

CHAPTER XIX. 



FRUITS. 



"Bring me berries or such cooling fruit 
As the kind, hospitable woods provide." 

— COWPER. 



'Eat an apple every day and live forever." 



Ripe fruit is very appropriate and healthy for breakfast, and 
during the summer months is much more to be desired for dessert 
at dinner than rich pastry or hot puddings. Fruit should always 
be served as fresh and cold as possible. As a rule fruits should be 
arranged in a raised dish or comport. In serving mixed fruits 
whole, allow clusters of grapes to fall over the sides of the dish. In 
serving on a low tray or platter, pile apples, oranges, bananas or 
other large fruit first on the tray and arrange clusters of grapes to 
fall over the whole. 

Grapes. 

There is no more beautiful table decoration than grapes. 
Their exquisite coloring of purple, green, amber and red together 
with their own leaves making a combination for beauty impos- 
sible to surpass. 

The large hot house grapes piled on a cut glass epergne and 
with the stems tied together with a large bow of broad soft satin 
ribbon the same color as the grapes, make a most artistic center- 
piece for a dinner table. The epergne can be passed to the guests 
at the close of the dinner and small bunches may be cut from the 
cluster with silver grape scissors. 

Another attractive table decoration for autumn is to have a 
high fruit standard of gold afid white Bohemian glass in the center 
with two tall comports to match, one for each end of the table, 
filled with different colored grapes, with small bunches hanging 



256 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

over the edges. The Tiffany colored high dishes, which are now 
sold very cheaply, are beautiful for holding grapes as their color- 
ing is identical with the fruit. 



Cantaloupe Melons. 

A very delicious way to serve cantaloupe is to cut them in 
halves, crosswise. Remove seeds and membrane and put on ice. 
When time to serve, put one half on a grape leaf on each plate and 
in it put a heaping tablespoon of pineapple ice and serve immedi- 
ately. 

Musk Melons and Whipped Cream Surprise. 

Select small melons and chill. Cut off a section that may 
serve as a Hd and carefully clean. Then fill with whipped cream, 
sweetened and mixed with a little chopped preserved ginger and 
marshmallows cut fine with scissors. Cover with hd. Carefully 
pack in a rather deep pan and surround with chopped ice and 
salt. Let stand 1 hour. Draw a narrow yellow ribbon through 
the Hd tied in a bow. Serve on a platter filled with crushed ice 
and garnished with nasturtiums and their leaves. 

Musk Melon Basket. 

Cut 2 pieces from small melons in such a way as to form a 
handle. Take out the pulp, membrane and seeds. Cut the pulp in 
small cubes, sprinkle with fine sugar and chill thoroughly. When 
ready to serve, place each melon basket on a grape leaf on a pretty 
plate, fill with the chilled pulp and serve at once. 

Compote of Oranges. 

Peel and skin 6 oranges. Cut into halves crosswise and with 
a sharp pointed vegetable knife remove the cores and seeds. Boil 
1 cup of sugar with 1 cup of water and add the juice of 3^ lemon. 
Arrange the oranges right side up in a round fruit dish, pour over 
the syrup very slowly and fill the centers with boiled rice and serve 
at once. They may be garnished with chopped almonds, candied 
cherries or chopped candied pineapple. . 

Compote of Pjears. 

Cut thin slices of bread into pear shaped pieces. Toast them 
in the oven till they are a golden brown. Pare and cut the pears 



FRUITS. 257 

into halves and remove coi'es. Boil Yi cup of sugar, 1 cup of water 
and the juice of 1 lemon. Put the pears into the sja'up and cook 
slowly 5 minutes. Arrange toast on a dish and put half a pear on 
each slice. Put 3^ pound of candied cherries into the syrup and 
bring to a boiling point. Heap cherries into the center of the dish 
and pour the syrup over the whole. 

Watermelon. 

Watermelon should be thoroughly chilled before using. There 
are various ways of serving this beautiful fruit. The old-fashioned 
way of slicing crosswise and bringing to the table on a large plat- 
ter is always appetizing. It may also be cut lengthwise. A new 
and pretty way to serve is to cut in tw'o crosswise and with a potato 
scoop, scoop out little round balls, soak in Sherry and serve 
either in half a cantaloupe or pile on a grape leaf on a small plate. 

Watermelon Hearts. 

Chill a watermelon and cut in 3^ inch slices. With a heart 
shaped cookie cutter, cut out from slices as many hearts as de- 
sired. Arrange on a platter in several piles and surround with 
crushed ice. Garnish with mint. 



Rose Pineapple. 

Put a slice of pineapple on a small plate with a wreath of 
smilax around it. Take juice of pineapple and make a thick syrup 
of it, almost a jelly; color pink with fruit coloring, put a tablespoon- 
ful on top of pineapple and heap whipped cream on top. Nice for 
course at luncheon or dinner. 

— Mrs. Fanny Moffatt. 

Strawberries. 

The most beautiful way to serve strawberries is to select fine, 
large berries, 6 or 8 for a person, and place them on a plate with- 
out being hulled, on their own leaves if possible to get them. Have 
a molded mound of pulverized sugar in the center and arrange 
the berries around it. 

Strawberry Cocktail. 

Add to the juice of 3 oranges the juice of 1 lemon and fine 
sugar to taste, making the mixture rather tart; stir until the sugar 



258 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

is dissolved, then put on ice. Stem, wash and chill some fine 
strawberries. When ready to serve, cut the berries in halves and 
put into champagne glasses, pour over the fruit juice and add a 
tablespoon of cracked ice. This makes a dainty first course for 
a luncheon or dinner. 

Strawberry Tarts. 

Line small patty pans with a rich pie crust and bake. Just 
befor^ serving fill with fresh strawberries dusted with powdered 
sugar. Whip some rich cream until stiff, add sugar to sweeten and 
flavor with pineapple or orange. Pile it high over the berries and 
serve at once. 

Grape Fruit. 

Cut grape fruit into halves crosswise. With a sharp pointed 
vegetable knife cut around the edge of the pulp to loosen, also cut 
between the divisions of the pulp, remove core and seeds. Sprinkle 
with sugar and pour over it 1 tablespoon of apricot brandy and 
put a Maraschino cherry in the top of each half. Baskets may 
be made economically in serving for several people by having an 
extra grape fruit. Skin it carefully and cut the skin into strips 
about 3^ or 3^ an inch wide. Pin a strip for a handle on each pre- 
pared half and wind with a little smilax. Serve very cold. 

Cherries. 

California cherries, either the light red or dark red, make a 
beautiful first course for a breakfast or luncheon by putting them 
in a pan with chopped ice with the stems on till they are very cold. 
When ready to serve, take 6 or 7 for each plate. Wipe them and 
tie the stems together, to make a bunch, with red satin baby rib- 
bon. Serve on small green leaves and have a little mound of pul- 
verized sugar on each plate. 

Cherry Salad. 

Select firm, large cherries; remove pit and insert a filbert or 
part of English walnut meat. Moisten with French salad dress- 
ing and serve in lemon peel cups. 

— Mrs. H. T. Goddard. 

Peach Snow Balls. 
Pare nice peaches. Roll in powdered sugar, then in melted 
fondant, tinted pink with fruit coloring; then roll in fresh grated 
cocoanut. 



FRUITS. 259 

Ambrosia. 

One dozen sweet oranges (skin and slice); 1 large fresh cocoa- 
nut (grated). Put alternate layers of the orange and grated cocoa- 
nut in a glass dish and sprinkle pulverized sugar over each layer 
of the cocoanut. This is an old-fashioned dish, but is delicious and 
palatable. 

—Mrs. S. W. C. 



Slices of orange dipped in spiced wine is a famous dessert in 
Jaffa. 

A Favorite Dessert. 

Mix orange pulp; white grapes, cut in halves; candied cher- 
ries, chopped fine; and a grated pineapple with 3^ cupful of pow- 
dered sugar. Put in a cool place and let stand. At serving time, 
fill dessert glasses with 2 tablespoons of this mixture; put a table- 
spoonful of lemon water ice in the center of each glass. Cover it 
over with 4 tablespoonfuls of whipped cream and serve at once. 

— N. S. M. 

Heavenly Hasli. 

Slice 6 oranges, 1 pineapple and 6 bananas after the skins have 
been removed. Lay the sliced bananas in a chilled glass bowl, 
sprinkle them with fine sugar and chopped nuts. Then put a layer 
of oranges, sugared, and more nuts, then a layer of pineapple, 
sugared, and nuts. Lastly, a thin layer of oranges, cut small, and 
strawberries mixed lightly together. Cover deep with whipped 
cream. Garnish with candied cherries and serve ice cold. 

—Mrs. G. G. 

A wine glass of Sherry poured over the fruit before the whip- 
ped cream is put on would add piquancy. 



Fruit Salpicon. 

Three bananas; 2 oranges or a pint of strawberries; 3^ a pine- 
apple; y2 cup of Maraschino cherries; 1 lemon (juice); 1 cup of 
sugar; y^ pound of white grapes. Peel the bananas, remove the 
coarse threads and cut the pulp in thin slices; peel the oranges 
and cut in lengthwise shces; cut the skin from the pineapple and 
take out core, cut up fine. Skin the grapes and remove seeds. If 
strawberries are used, cut them in halves. Mix the fruit hghtly 



260 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

with the sugar and lemon juice and chill thoroughly and quickly. 
Serve in sherbet glasses or orange skins. Makes a delicious relish 
at the beginning of a luncheon or dinner. 

— Mrs. C. Starr. 



Salpicon of Strawberries and Pineapple. 

Cut off the top of a pineapple and cut off a little of the bottom 
so that it will stand upright and firmly on the plate. Scoop out 
the pulp, discarding the core. Mix the pulp with strawberries, 
cut in halves, the juice of 2 oranges and sugar to taste. Chill the 
mixture thoroughly and return it to the shell. Garnish either with 
flowers or leaves cut from the crown of the pineapple. 

— Lena Keith Marsh. 

Tutti-Frutti. 

One pound of strawberries; 1 pound of currants; 1 pound of 
cherries; 1 pound of peaches; 1 pound of grapes; 1 pound of plums; 
1 pound of pineapple. Cut up and stone the large fruits, pit the 
cherries and plums and seed the grapes. Add 3^ pound of sugar to 
each 2 pounds of fruit and 3^ pint of good brandy. Put in layers 
with the sugar and brandy between. Do not cook it at all. Many 
people start their tutti-frutti in the early summer, adding to it as 
the fruits come along, and adding other fruits, always keeping the 
same quantity of sugar and brandy in proportion. Delicious with 
ice cream or meats. 

Tutti-Frutti of Candied Fruits. 

One-half pound almonds (blanched); Y^ pound candied pine- 
apple; M pound candied ginger; % pound candied citron; Y pound 
Maraschino cherries. Chop separately, fine, and stir together; pack 
in a Mason fruit jar, cover with a syrup made of 1 cup of sugar and 
1 cup of water boiled together and add 1 cup of rum. Seal it up. 

Very nice to eat with ice cream. 

— Mrs. Fanny Moffatt. 

Cranberry Sauce. 

One quart of cranberries; 2 cups of sugar. Wash the cran- 
berries and put them into 2 quarts of boiling water. Cook till the 
skins burst, add the sugar and cook about 5 minutes. Serve in 
a glass dish. 



FRUITS. 261 

Apple Sauce. 

Six tart apples; 1 cup sugar; 7/ cup water. Boil sugar and 
water. Pare, core and c^uarter apples and cook in the syrup 3 or 4 
minutes or until tender. Take out the apples and boil the syrup 
down a little and pour it over the apples. 

Devonshire Cream. 

Put 4 quarts of milk in a shallow pan, let it stand in a cool 
place over night. In the morning set it carefully on the stove so 
as not to disturb and bring it very slowly almost to a boil. Then 
place in a cold place and when thoroughly chilled, remove the 
cream carefully. The English prepare this Devonshire cream for 
almost constant use. It is delicious on strawberries, raspberries 
or peaches.

CHAPTER XX. 

CANDY AND CONFECTIONS. 



"A wilderness of sweets." 

— Milton — Paradise Lost. 

The art of making candy is easily learned. It is cheaper to 
make good candy at home than to buy good store candy, and 
cheap candy should not be eaten, as it is frequently adulter- 
ated. When one has learned how to boil sugar for fondants, to dip 
chocolate and to properly cook caramels and other similar candies, 
it will be found comparatively easy to produce many toothsome 
dainties. 

One advantage of home-made candy is the choice it affords 
of flavoring ingredients and combinations. In nut candy it is pos- 
sible to attain a great variety from the same recipes by utilizing 
the less common kinds of nuts. Crystalized fruits also permit of a 
large range of choice, while fresh fruits coated with fondant are 
always popular. 

Boiled Sugar for Confections. 

Eleven tests are considered for boiling sugar: — 
Small thread, 215 degrees F. The feather, 232 degrees F. 

Large thread, 217 degrees F. Soft ball, 238 degrees F. 

Pearl, 220 degrees F. Hard ball, 248 degrees F. 

Large pearl, 222 degrees F, Small crack, 290 degrees F. 

The blow, 230 degrees F. Crack, 310 degrees F. 

Caramel, 350 degrees F. 

Fondant, the basis of all French candy, is made of sugar and 
water boiled together (with a small quantity of cream of tartar to 
prevent sugar from granulating) to soft ball, 238 degrees F. The 
professional confectioner is able to decide when syrup has boiled 
to the right temperature by sound while boiling, and by testing 
in cold water; these tests at first seem somewhat difficult to the 
amateur, but only a little experience is necessary to make fondant 
successfully. A sugar thermometer is often employed, and proves 
valuable, as by its use one need not exercise his judgment. 



CANDY AND CONFECTIONS. 263 

White Fondant. 

Two and one-half pounds sugar (5 cups); 13-^ cups hot water; 
]4: teaspoon cream tartar. Put ingredients in a smooth granite 
stew pan; stir, place on range, and heat gradually to boiling point. 
Boil, without stirring, until when tried in cold water a soft ball 
may be formed that will just keep in shape, which is 238 degrees F. 
After a few minutes boiling, sugar will adhere to sides of kettle; 
remove this with a wooden spoon, covered with cloth to prevent 
fondant from granulating. Pour slowly on a slightly oiled marble 
slab. Let stand a few minutes to cool, but not long enough to be- 
come hard around the edge. Scrape fondant with chopping-knife 
to one end of marble and work with a wooden spatula until white 
and creamy. It will quickly change from this consistency and be- 
gin to lump when it should be kneaded with the hands until per- 
fectly smooth. Put into a bowl and cover with oiled paper to 
exclude the air, that a crust may not form on top and let stand 24 
hours. A large oiled platter and a wooden spoon may be used in 
place of a marble slab and spatula. Always make fondant on a 
clear day, as a damp and heavy atmosphere has an unfavorable 
effect on the boiling of sugar. Fondant may be kept several months 
and is better after it is made some time. 

For large quantity of fondant: 10 pounds sugar; 5 pints w^ater; 
2 teaspoons cream of tartar. 

Coffee Fondant. 

Two and one-half pounds sugar; 34 cup ground coffee; 13^ 
cups cold water; 34 teaspoon cream of tartar. Put water and coffee 
in sauce pan and heat to boiling point. Strain through double 
cheese cloth, then add sugar and cream of tartar and cook as white 
fondant. 

Maple Fondant. 
One and one-fourth pounds maple sugar; 1 cup hot water; 
134 pounds granulated sugar; 3^ teaspoon cream of tartar. Mix 
maple and granulated sugar and add remaining ingredients and 
cook as white fondant. 

Bon Bens. 

(a) Centers of bon bons are made of fondant. Shaped in 
small balls. If white fondant is used, flavor as desired. 

(b) Cocoanut centers: Work as much shredded cocoanut as 
possible into small amount of fondant. 



264 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

(c) Nut centers: Surround the nut meats with fondant, 
chopped or whole meats, as desired. 

(d) French candied cherries are excellent as centers. Cover 
with fondant. 

(e) Lemon juice and powdered sugar may be mixed to form 
balls and orange juice may also be used. 

(f) One teaspoon of strained raspberry jam and enough pow- 
dered sugar to make stiff paste, makes excellent centers. 

(g) Grape jelly may also be used; allow balls to stand over 
night. 

To Dip Bon Bons. 

Put fondant in sauce pan and melt over hot water. Color 
and flavor as desired. Dip balls into melted fondant and put on 
oil paper. 

Dipped Walnuts. 

Melt fondant and flavor; dip halves of walnuts and place on 
oil paper. Pecans or whole blanched almonds may be used. 

Cream Nut Bars. 

1. Melt fondant and flavor. Stir in any kind of nut meats. 
Cut in pieces. Turn '-n oiled paper or pan. Cool and cut in bars 
with sharp knife. 

2. Maple fondant is delicious with nuts. 

Chocolate Creams. 

Roll some of the fondant into small balls and press these flat 
between 2 halves of English walnuts. Melt a cake of bitter, un- 
sweetened chocolate in a basin of hot water for covering the can- 
dies with chocolate. Take the candies, one at a time, on a tooth- 
pick and pour the melted chocolate over them with a teaspoon, 
and when well covered, slip them upon oiled paper. 

Mints. 

The mints with any desired flavoring, such as peppermint, 
wintergreen, vanilla or lemon, may be made by stirring some of 
the fondant in a double boiler until it melts. Add the flavoring 
and drop in small lumps on oiled paper. The lump will flatten out 
before hardening.

died pineapple or cherries. Mold in loaf and cut in slices when cold. 

— Mrs. Reckhow. 

Caramel Fudge. 

Two cups sugar; 2 teaspoons butter; ^ cup cream; 2 tea- 
spoons vanilla; 1 scant cup of caramelized sugar. 

Part 1. Place a scant cup of granulated sugar in a steel fry- 
ing pan and melt slowly over a moderate heat, until it reaches a 
light brown color and all the granules have disappeared. 

Part 2. Place sugar and cream in sauce pan and let cook 

slowly until boiling point is reached, then add the sugar which 

has been caramelized; stir for a moment until thoroughly mixed, 

then let mixture boil until it reaches the "soft ball" stage. Remove 

from fire, add butter and vanilla and beat until cool and thick. 

Walnuts, cocoanut or marshmallows are a great addition to this 

recipe. 

— R. M. Carey.

vanilla. Put the milk and butter in a sauce pan and when the but- 
ter is melted, add the sugar, cocoa and salt. Stir until dissolved, 
then cook, stirring occasionally until it strings, which takes about 
5 to 8 minutes. Add the vanilla, Y2 cup chopped nuts. Beat 
gently and when it just begins to thicken, pour into a buttered 
pan. When hard, cut in squares. The fudge must not be beaten 
much, for if it thickens, it cannot be poured into the pan. 



Cocoanut Fudge. 

Use the recipe for chocolate fudge, omitting the chocolate, 
and add just before beating some shredded cocoanut. Be careful 
not to be too generous with it, or the fudge will become grainy.

this water and boil 20 minutes in plain water. Then after pouring 
off this water, boil again in plain water for about 20 minutes. Then 
add as much sugar to dissolve it. Boil the sugar and water until 
it is a syrup. Then add the peeling and cook it down until there is 
nothing left to boil. It should boil under a very slow fire at the 
last. Then take each piece out and roll it in granulated or pow- 
dered sugar. Put away to get cold and stiff. If packed in fruit 
jars it will keep for many months. 

— Charles Bro use

quartered, and the pineapple is cut in slices half an inch thick 
across the fruit. The coarse fibre of the centre should be cut out 
of each slice. Weigh the fruit, and allow an equal quantity of the 
best white sugar. Make a rich syrup of a small cup of water to 
each pound of sugar. Boil for a few minutes, then add the fruit, 
and cook gently until it is transparent. Remove the fruit carefully 
onto a wire strainer, and let stand until perfectly cold. Then 
sprinkle liberally with powdered sugar, and set the strainer on a 
dis"h in a moderate warm oven for 2 hours, repeating the process 
until the juice has ceased to drip and the outside is dry and crystal- 
lized. It is then removed from the oven, and allowed to get per- 
fectly cold before it is packed away in boxes between layers of 
waxed papers.

Drink to me only with thine eyes 
And I will pledge with mine 

Or leave a kiss but in the cup

WINES. 



God made Man frail as a bubble 

God made Love— Love made Trouble. 

God made the Vine; was it a sin 

That Man made Wine to drown Trouble in? 

— Anon. 



The rule for service of wine at a dinner party calls for white 
wine with the fish. Sherry with the soup. Claret and champagne 
with the roast. Maderia and port wines with the game. Maderia 
and port are decanted and should not be cold, but of the tempera- 
ture of the room. Champagne is either sweet or "dry" and must 
not be decanted, but kept in ice pails and opened when needed. 

Wine is good 

Love is good 

And all is good if understood. 

The sin is not in doing 

But in overdoing. 

How much of mine has gone that way 

Alas — How much more that may! 



276 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

To Mull Wine. 

An Excellent French Recipe. 
Boil in a wineglassful and a half of water a quarter of an ounce 
of spice (cinnamon, ginger slightly bruised, and cloves), with 3 
ounces of fine sugar till they form a thick syrup, which must not, 
on any account, be allowed to burn. Pour in a pint of port wine 
and stir it gently till it is on the point of boiling only; it should 
then be served immediately. The addition of a strip or two of 
orange rind, cut extremely thin, gives to this beverage the flavor 
of bishop. In France light claret takes the place of port wine in 
making this, and the better kinds of Vins duPaysare very palatable 
thus prepared: Water, 13^ wineglassful; spice, 3^ ounce, to make 
which quantity use about 24 cloves and the rest of the amount in 
rather more ginger than cinnamon, and 3 ounces of sugar. Boil 15 
to 20 minutes. Port wine or claret, 1 pint, added last. If orange 
rind is used, it should be boiled with the spices. (Taken from an 
old English cook book, published in 1845). 

Port Wine. 

Good imported port wine, 3 gallons; good prepared cider, 12 
gallons; juice of elderberries, 3 gallons: good brandy, 13^ gallons; 
cochineal, 3 ounces. Pulverize the cochineal very fine, put it with 
the brandy into a stone jug; let it remain at least 2 weeks. Have 
cider ready and put 6 gallons of the cider into a 20 gallon cask. 
Add to this the elder juice, port wine, brandy and cochineal. Take 
the remaining 6 gallons of cider with part of which clean out your 
jug that contained the brandy, and pour the whole into the cask; 
bung it tight and in 6 weeks it will be ready for use. 

Wines — Currant, Blackberry or Elderberry. 

These all have powerful medicinal properties, and every fam- 
ily should have at least one kind on hand. The cost of the wine 
is nothing compared to the benefit derived from using it, when 
needed, as it often saves the expense of medicines, as well 
as doctor's bills, besides being more palatable to take than medicine. 

Red or White Currant Wine. 

First place the fruit in a tub or jar and mash or crush it. A 
better way is to put it in a kettle over the fire, crushing some of the 
fruit when first put in, and adding a very little water, just enough 
to keep it from burning. Boil until soft^ then put through a cloth 



DRINKS AND BEVERAGES. 277 

lined cylinder. To each quart of juice obtained, add 3 quarts of 
water and 23^ to 3 pounds of sugar, according to taste. Put the 
mixture in a keg, leaving the cork or bung loose, or put it in a tub 
or jar, covering the same with a thin cloth so that the air may 
have access to it. Set it aside and allow it to ferment for about 10 
days, or until fermentation ceases. It is a good plan to skim it 
occasionally with a perforated skimmer while fermenting. After 
that pour it in bottles or jugs, allowing the corks to remain very 
loose, as it will work again for 2 or 3 days. Then when through 
working, take out the corks and fill bottles with juice reserved for 
that purpose. After all signs of fermentation cease, put in the 
corks very tight, tie or wire them in and seal. Wine is best kept 
in a cool place. Blackberry, elderberry, grape or rhubarb wine 
may be made in the same way with the exception that a smaller 
proportion of sugar is required for blackberry. and elderberry wine. 



Elderberry Wine No. II. 

Water, 5 gallons; elderberry, 5 gallons; white sugar, 22 pounds; 
red tartar, 4 ounces. Put these into cask, and add a little yeast 
and let it ferment. When undergoing fermentation, add ginger 
root, 2 ounces; allspice, 2 ounces; cloves, 3^ ounce. Put them into 
clean cotton bag and suspend in the cask. They give a pleasant 
flavor to the wine, which will become clear in about 2 months, 
and may then be drawn off and bottled. 



Currant Wine No. II. 

Take 1 pailful of water to every pailful of currants on the stem. 
Wash and strain; add 3M pounds of sugar to every gallon of the 
mixture of juice and water. Mix well and put into the cask, which 
should be placed in the cellar on the tilt, so that it can easily be 
racked off in October without stirring up the sediment. 2 bushels 
of currants will make 1 barrel of wine. Fill the barrel within 3 
inches of the bung, and make it air-tight by placing wet clay over 
it after it is driven in. 

Cherry Wine. 

To make 10 pints of this wine take 30 pounds of cherries and 
4 pounds of currants; bruise and mix them together. Mix with 
them % of the kernels and put the whole mixture into a barrel 
with }i pound of sugar to every pint of juice The barrel should 



278 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

be quite full. Cover the barrel with vine leaves and sand above 
thenij and let stand in a cool place until through working, which 
will be in about 3 weeks; then stop it with a bung and in 2 months 
it may be bottled, 

Apple Wine. 

To each gallon of cider, as soon as it comes from the press, 
add 2 pounds of loaf sugar; boil as long as any scum arises, then 
strain through a sieve and let it cool; now add some good yeast, 
mix well; let it work in the tub 2 or 3 weeks, then skim off the 
scum; draw it off close and turn it; let it stand about a year, then 
rack it off and add 2 ounces of isinglass to the barrel; then add 3^ 
pint spirits of wine to every 8 gallons. 

Note — ^The old recipes all speak of gelatine as isinglass. 

Ginger Wine. 

Bruised ginger, 4 ounces; lump sugar, 10 pounds; water, 5 
gallons. Add 2 eggs. Boil well and skim. Then pour hot on 3 or 4 
lemons, cut in slices. Macerate for 2 hours, then rack and ferment. 
Add spirits, 1 quart; finings, 3^ pint; rummage well; to make color, 
boil saleratus, 3^ ounce; alum, Y^ ounce; in 1 pint of water till 
you get a bright color. 

Lemon Wine. 

Water, 15 gallons; raisins (bruised) 8 pounds; sugar, 30 pounds. 
Boil, then add cider, 7 gallons; ferment and add spirits, 13^ gal- 
lons; white tartar, 6 ounces; essence of lemon, 1 ounce; finings, 3^ 
pint. Shake well the essence with a pint of the spirit until it be- 
comes milky before adding to the wine. 

Dandelion Wine. 

Two quarts of blossoms without any stems (which would make 
the wine bitter). Pour over them 1 gallon of boihng water and 
let stand 3 days and nights, then strain and add 3 pounds of white 
sugar, 2 shced lemons and 2 sliced oranges. Boil for 5 minutes. 
When cooled sufficiently to be about milk warm, add 1 tablespoon- 
ful of good yeast and put in a jug to ferment. Keep the jug full 
until fermentation ceases, and bottle in about 6 weeks. 

— Mrs. W. p. Lamb.

Grape Wine. 

Water, 4 quarts; grape juice, 4 quarts; sugar, 8 pounds. Ex- 
tract the juice in any simple way, if only a few quarts are desired. 
One can do it with a strainer and a pair of squeezers. Use per- 
fectly ripe grapes. After the first pressing, put a little water with 
the pulp and press a second time, using the juice of the second 
pressing with the water to be mixed with the clear grape juice. 
Put in a keg and fill even full. After fermentation has taken 
place and the scum removed, drain off, bottle and cork tightly. 



Unfermented Wine. 

Pick the grapes well ripened; remove carefully all decayed 
and unripe fruit. Mixed varieties of grapes may be used. Ex- 
press the juice and boil as long as any scum arises; skim carefully 
from time to time; do not boil over an hour; bottle it while hot, 
and seal either in glass bottles, jugs or air-tight casks. It is in 
condition to be used at any time, but after it is once opened it 
must not be allowed to ferment. With the exception of straw- 
berry syrup, this wall be found to be the most delightful and ex- 
hilarating of all unfermented beverages. It needs no sugar, and 
may be diluted when served. 



Unfermented Grape Juice. 

Ten cupfuls Concord grapes; 6 cupfuls water; 2 cupfuls sugar. 
Mash the grapes and cook in 3 cujos of the water; strain; add to 
the skins and seeds 3 more cups of water and cook again; strain. 
Add to the strained juice the 2 cups of sugar and boil 5 minutes. 
Skim, bottle hot in air-tight jars. In serving, add sugar and sliced 
lemon or lemon juice, ice and the grape juice. This is a simple, 
but delicious drink.

CORDIALS. 

For highest cordials all their virtues lose 
By a too frequent and too bold a use. 
And what would cheer the spirits in distress, 
Ruins our health when taken to excess. 

— John Pomfret, in "The Choice." 

Mint Cordial. 

Crush a large bunch of mint and soak the leaves for 1 hour in 
the strained juice of 2 lemons and the grated rind of 1. Cook to- 
gether 1 pint of water and the same amount of sugar until the 
syrup threads. Take from fire and stir into it the lemon and mint, 
the juice of an orange and, if at hand, an equal amount of pine- 
apple juice. Strain and add enough cold water to make a rich 
beverage. Ice and serve. The use of apollinaris water or seltzer 
improves it. 

Blackberry Cordial. 

Put ])erries in a kettle with a very little water and cook until 
soft, then turn into a press cylinder, first putting in a thin muslin 
cloth large enough to fold over the top of the fruit. After pressing 
out the juice add to each pint of juice 1 pound of loaf sugar, 3/2 
ounce of powdered cinnamon, 3^ ounce of mace, 2 teaspoonfuls 
of whole cloves and boil all together for 15 minutes and strain. To 
each quart add 1 pint of good French brandy. It is then ready to 
be bottled. Before using, dilute with water, if necessary. This 
syrup is a sovereign remedy for all summer complaints. 

Quince Cordial. 

Use ripe, sound quinces; rub off fur, cut in small pieces; pour 
over just enough cold water to cover, and simmer until the pulp 
is soft. Put in a double cheese cloth bag and let it drip over night. 
Do not squeeze or press because wdiat remains in the bag can be 
taken through a sieve and used for marmalade. Measure the j nice, add 
}/2 pint of granulated sugar to each pint of liquid, also 2 blanched 
peach kernels. To 3 pints allow 2 cloves. Boil for 15 minutes. 
Skim well, remove from fire, strain and add l^ jDint of brandy to 
each pint of syrup. Turn into a stone jar, protect the opening 
with cheese cloth, let stand a week and then bottle and cork se- 
curely. It may be used in 2 months, but is better if kept 1 year.

CIDER. 



"The cups that cheer but not inebriate wait on each." 

— Wm. Cowper. 

Pear, Orange, Grape or Apple Cider. 

Cider may be made from pears, oranges or grapes as well as 
from apples. Put the fruit over the fire with barely enough water 
to keep from burning, and cover, letting it steam or cook slowly 
until soft. Press out all juice and the result is a pure cider. In 
making orange cider, peel fruit and it is then easily pressed with- 
out heating. 

To Keep Cider Sweet. 

Cider may be kept sweet for 10 years by first putting it in a 
kettle and bringing it to a boil. Set bottles in a pan of cold water 
on the stove and allow the same to come to a boiling heat. Fill 
the bottles, as they stand in the hot water, with the cider. Set 
aside to cool, then cork and seal. 



Champagne Cider. 

Make cider from foregoing recipe and after filling strong pop 
bottles, add 3 raisins and 1 teaspoonful of syrup or sugar to each 
pint of juice. Wire corks in tightly and seal. 



BEER. 

"I do now remember the poor creature, small beer." 

— King Henry IV. 

Cottage Beer. 

Water, 10 gallons; good sweet wheat bran, 1 peck; good hops, 
3 handfuls. Boil all together until the bran and hops sink to the 
bottom. Strain through a thin cloth and when about luke warm, 
add 2 quarts of molasses. As soon as the molasses is melted pour 
the whole into a 9 or 10 gallon cask, with 2 tablespoons of yeast. 
When fermentation ceases, bung up the cask and in about 4 days 
it will be readv for use. 



282 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Ginger Beer. 

Honey, 1 pound; sugar, 20 pounds; lemon juice, 18 ounces; 
yeast, 6 pints; water, 18 gallons; bruised ginger root, 22 ounces. 
Boil the ginger 3^ hour in a gallon of water, then add the rest of 
the water and the other ingredients, and strain, when cool. Add 
the whites of 2 eggs, beaten, and 1 ounce of essence of lemon. Let 
it stand for 4 days and then bottle and it will keep a long time if 
you don't drink it. 

Hops Beer. 

Hops, 6 ounces; water, 5 quarts. Boil 3 hours, then strain 
off the liquor. Pour on 4 quarts of water and 12 spoonfuls of gin- 
ger and boil the hops 3 hours longer. Strain it and mix with the 
other liquor and stir in 2 quarts of molasses. Brown, very dry, 3^ 
pound of bread and put in — rusked bread is best. Pound fine and 
brown in a pot like coffee. After it- has cooled so that it is luke 
warm, add a pint of new yeast that is free from salt. Keep the 
barrel covered in a cool place until fermentation ceases, which you 
may know by the settling of the post. Turn into kegs or bottles 
and keep in a cool place. 

Jamaica Ginger Beer. 

One 4 ounce bottle of Jamaica ginger; 1 ounce cream of tartar; 
6 quarts of water; 1 pound of sugar; grated rind of 1 lemon. Mix 
and heat through, add a tablespoonful of brewer's yeast. Bottle, 
tie the corks and lay in cellar. Good in 4 days.

CHAFING DISH RECIPES. 293 



CHAPTER XXII. 



CHAFING DISH RECIPES. 



Over forty years ago, before the clays of dining cars on the 
raih'oads, a party of Chicago gentlemen decided to take a journey 
to the Pacific Coast. Those were not the days of rapid transit and 
a journey to California meant a week or more of travel. It was 
the custom then for the trains to stop at railroad eating 
houses "twenty minutes for refreshments" and very poor meals 
they were. Not rehshing the idea of eating such food these trav- 
elers tried an entirely new experiment. There was living in Chi- 
cago at that time a 3'oung man by the name of Kinsley, who kept 
a small restaurant. His reputation for cooking was excellent. 
One of the partv was delegated to ask Mr. Kinsley if he would go 
with them and in some way manage to cook for them some good 
meals on the train. He consented to do so, carried food and chafing 
dishes and with the latter alone cooked and served to the party 
delicious meals of all kinds during the entire journey. He gained 
a great reputation for this and it was the beginning of his career 
as a famous caterer of national repute. He amassed a large for- 
tune and became one of the leading business men of Chicago. 

In a chafing dish can be cooked potatoes and other vegetables 
in various ways, eggs in all styles, cheese, oysters, clams, lobsters 
in many ways, birds, prairie chicken, steaks, chops, mushrooms, 
sweetbreads and many kinds of desserts. 

Chicken Terrapin. 

Put in the chafing dish the dark meat of cold chicken, turkey 
or shrimp; cut in small pieces, with a pint of cream or stock and 
when it comes to a boil, stir in the following mixture: 2 table- 
spoons of butter, rubbed into a smooth paste with a tablespoon 
of flour, and the yolks of 3 eggs; a teaspoonful of dry mustard; a 
little ca3'enne pepper and salt, all mixed with a little cream or 
stock. Let it simmer a few minutes (not boil) and serve. 

— Mrs. J. D. Waterman.

JELLIES, CANNING, PRESERVES, PICKLES. 297 



CHAPTER XXIII. 

JELLIES, CANNING, PRESERVES, 
PICKLES. 

"Hunger is the best seasoning for meat." 
JELLIES. 



Jelly Making, 

If acid fruits or juices are boiled with cane sugar, the sugar, 
under the influence of heat and moisture, and because of the acid, 
is divided into two sugars, one-half of which is dextrose, the other 
half levulose. The latter is usually in a syrup form. Syrup-like 
jelly has been boiled too long, because the sugar has split. It is 
more difficult to make jelly from an acid fruit. If the fruit is over- 
ripe, and an equal amount of sugar is used, crystals are formed, 
especially from grapes. 

The most satisfactory jelly test is that point at which the hot 
jelly forms a sheet, "jells," when dropped from a cold spoon. By 
this test there is no loss of time as in the usual one of cooHng a 
small amount of hot jelly. If jelly is not thick enough when cold, 
put in the sun to harden; cover with panes of glass. 

To summarize: avoid over dilution of juice; avoid an over 
supply of sugar; avoid over cooking of juice and sugar. 

Crabapple, Quince, Japan Quince, Lady Blush 
Apples, Black Currants. 

These fruits will make a firm jelly with 1 part sugar to 2 parts 
fruit juice. Do not pare the fruit, but remove the seeds and cores; 
cover with cold water and boil 20 minutes; drain through a jelly 
bag and boil 10 minutes, add the sugar which has been heated, 
let it come to a boil and try immediately; if done, skim and pour 
in glasses. When pefectly cold, cover with paraffine or with paper 
dipped in white of egg. Keep in a dry place. 



298 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Grape, Blackberry, Raspberry, Currant, Strawberry. 

These fruits make jelly eusih^, and are treated in the same 
manner as the preceding, only that an equal amount of sugar is 
used, with 1 exception: Use 2 parts sugar to 3 parts juice for grapes. 



Plum. 

Use water sparingly for plums. 



Raspberry and Currant. 

A delicious jelly may be made by using equal parts of currants 
and raspberries, red or black. 



Strawberry Jelly. 

Fill jelly glass Yi fi^ill of sun-preserved strawberries free from 
the syrup. Then fill glass with hot currant jelly, stirring the straw- 
berries evenly through as mixture cools. 

— Mrs. S. N. Jones. 



Marbled Jelly. 

Put in the bottom of a jelly glass a layer of dark jelly (grape 
or plum), let it cool and harden, then put in carefully a layer of 
apple, then another dark layer, then one of light, as green grape. 
Every time jelly is made a layer may be put in a glass and covered 
till another kind is made. This makes a pretty garnish for meats 
or desserts. 



Cranberry Jelly. 

Add a cup of water to a quart of cranberries. Boil about 15 
minutes or until soft. Take off and press through a sieve. Put 
in a double boiler and stir in 1 pint of sugar and boil about 5 min- 
utes. Turn into molds to harden. Do not take out of mold till 
time to serve, as cranberry jelly does not stand long without be- 
ginning to melt. Do not have cranberries too ripe. 



JELLIES, CANNING, PRESERVES, PICKLES. 299 

CANNING. 



Rules. 

To insure success in canning fruits, two points must be ob- 
served: First, the fruit must be fresh and not over ripe. Second, 
the cans, tops, rubbers and all utensils used, must be thoroughly 
sterilized with boihng water. 

Small Fruit. 

Prepare the fruit, add sugar to taste, put over a slow fire and 
bring to a boil; simmer a few moments, skim and can. Water may 
be added if more juice is desired. These fruits may be canned with 
perfect success without sugar and will better retain the flavor of 
the fresh fruit. Use a little water to prevent scorching. 



Large Fruit. 

For large fruits such as peaches, pears and plums make a syrup 
of 1 pound of sugar to 1 pint of water. Let it boil; skim, add the 
fruit, cook slowly till tender and seal. 



Another Method. 

Place a wooden or wire rack in a boiler. Fill the cans with 
fruit, lay the covers on loosely; place in the rack and put on cold 
water the depth of the rack. Let it boil 10 or 15 minutes. Mean- 
while prepare a rich syrup, putting in some of the fruit to flavor it. 
Take out the cans, fill them with the syrup, screw the covers on 
tight, replace in the boiler and boil till done. Small fruits should 
boil 15 minutes, large ones about 3^ hour. Let the cans remain in 
the boiler until cold. 



To Can Strawberries Without Cooking. 

Use nice firm berries (be sure they are not picked after a rain). 

Fill the cans, shaking them down, pour over them boihng hot 

syrup in the proportion of 5 quarts of sugar to 2 quarts of water; 

seal. Place the cans in a deep receptacle and cover with boiling 

water. Let them stand in the water till cold. All kinds of fruit 

may be canned in this way. 

— Mrs. Murray Carpenter. 



300 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

To Can Strawberries, Cherries or Raspberries. 

Four quarts of fruit; 1 quart of sugar; 3 tablespoons water. 
Put in granite or porcelain pan with tight cover and cook in a hot 
oven 20 minutes. Do not uncover while cooking. The fruit will 
not shrink or change color. 

—Mrs. S. M. Gantz, Dixon, 111. 

Small Fruits, Canned Cold. 

Mash the fruit; add an equal amount of sugar; mix thoroughly 
until every particle of fruit is impregnated with sugar. Set on ice 
over night, then can in cold cans. This is used for small fruits. 

Peaches. 

Pare the peaches, remove the stones and drop the fruit into 
cold water to prevent discoloration. Prepare a syrup in the pro- 
portion of 2 quarts of water to 1 pound of sugar, boil until clear. 
Pack the fruit tightly in jars, then fill with the boiling syrup and 
seal at once. Set the jars in a wash boiler or tub, cover with boil- 
ing water, then place a lid or blanket over them and let stand till 
cold. 

To Can Vegetables. 

Tomatoes, asparagus, string beans, peas, beets and corn may 
be canned if cooked in the jars in which they are to be kept. As- 
paragus and beans should be cooked 15 minutes before putting 
into jars. Beets must be cooked 30 minutes, peel them and put into 
jars. Then fill the jars with cold water, adjust the rubbers, lay 
the covers on loosely, put the jars in a rack in the boiler, partly 
cover with cold water and boil 1 hour. Lift out the rack, screw the 
covers on tight, put back in the boiler, cover with boiling water 
and boil 30 minutes. 

Peas need not be cooked before putting into jars, but must be 
boiled 2 hours before and 30 minutes after screwing covers on. 
Corn should be cut or pressed from the cob and packed into jars, 
then boiled 23^2 hours and finished as above. 

All vegetables should be canned the day they are picked and 
all utensils used must be sterilized. 

Tomatoes may be stewed in a kettle and put into cans. Pour 
boiling water over the tomatoes to remove the skins; cut into 
pieces, put into a granite or porcelain kettle and cook slowly 30 
minutes.

PRESERVES. 



Preserved Fruit. 

Preserved fruits are those which are cooked in a thick syrup. 
Allow 1 pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. For large fruits 
prepare this syrup with the required amount of sugar dissolved 
in a little water. 

Conserves or Candied Fruit. 

Conserves or candied fruits are preserved fruits, dried. Pre- 
pare as above, and simmer gently until transparent; drain in a 
sieve, dust with sugar and dry in the sun or in a moderate oven. 
When it has lost its moisture roll in granulated sugar. Keep be-

Strawberry Preserves. 

One quart of strawberries; 1 quart of sugar. Put strawber- 
ries in a porcelain or granite kettle and cook, without water, 20 
minutes over a slow fire, then add sugar and cook 5 minutes; put 
into jelly tumblers and when cold cover with paraffine and seal. 
It is best to cook only 1 quart at a time to prevent the fruit from 
breaking up. The berries remain whole and the preserve is rich 

and delicious.

CHAPTER XXIV. 



FIRELESS COOKERY. 



"It is the bounty of nature that we live; but of philosophy 

that we live well." 

— Seneca 



There are on the market a number of cookers or patent de- 
vices for cooking without fire. These vary somewhat in detail ; there 
is the lined box holding one or more empty pails; the same style 
of box with pails within pails or with wire supports inside; and the 
triple pail or kettle arrangement simply made by placing the ket- 
tles one within the other and leaving the required space between 
each two. 

The enormous saving of fuel, labor and discomfort obtained 
by the process is a welcome boon to the busy housewife and with 
the added advantage that the flavor is retained to a much greater 
extent than possible by direct boiling. 

For one inexperienced in this method it is advisable to know 
the time required for the different foods before they are placed 
in the cooker. 

Food left indefinitely in the cooker will sour. All soups, vege- 
tables and such things must be removed in twenty-four hours and 
less in warm weather. 

Food which requires long cooking is improved if when the 
time is half up it is removed, without opening the pail, and reheated 
again before placing a second time in the cooker. 

Food should be placed in the box at once on removing from 
the fire, keeping the lid on tightly so that no steam escapes or the 
food will cool and cannot cook. 

Since this method of preparing food is still largely in an ex- 
perimental stage, the following time table may serve as a guide 
and be considered fairly accurate:

320 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

(For the cooker which has one pail within another, the outer one 

containing water.) 

Cereals. 

One cup of oatmeal, 3 cups of water. 

One cup cornmeal or rice, 4 cups of water. 

Bring the water in the outer pail to a boil. Put into the smaller 
pail the required water, let boil, add the meal and salt, let boil 10 
minutes. Place the smaller kettle within the larger, pack in the 
cooker, let stand all night. In the morning, reheat. 

Vegetables. 

Potatoes require 1 hour, if small. Dry in the oven later to 
make them mealy. 

Peas require 1 hour. 

Beets, squash, carrots, turnips need 3 hours and must be 
taken out when half done, reheated, the water reboiled in the 
outer pail and packed again in the cooker. 

Prepare the vegetables as usual, boil them for 5 minutes, 
place the smaller kettle in the outer one containing boiling water 
and put into the cooker. 

Baked Beans. 

Let the beans soak over night in cold water; in the morning 
drain, then add twice as much fresh water as there are beans; put 
in a piece of salt pork. Boil them 15 minutes, set the kettle into 
the larger one containing boiling water and pack in the cooker for 
3 hours. Remove, boil again and put in the cooker for 3 hours 
longer. Place into a baking dish and brown them in the oven. 
Add seasoning at the time of the second heating. 

Soups. 
Cut the meat into pieces, pour on cold water, add the vege- 
tables, season well, and boil about 15 minutes. Leave in the cooker 
all night. In the morning skim, strain and reheat. 

Boiled Fish. 

Tie the fish in a clean piece of cheese cloth, let simmer for 10 
minutes in boiling water, set the kettle in the outer pail of boiling 
water and pack for 3 hours. 



FIRELESS COOKERY. 321 

Boiled Meats. 
Beef Stew: Cut up the meat, put into hot fat and brown 
quickly. Add 1 cup of water to 2 cups of meat, season, boil 10 
minutes, put into the outer kettle of boihng water and pack for 2 
hours. Then reheat and cook 2 hours longer. 

Lamb Stew: Cut up meat, use 1 cup of water to 2 of meat, 
boil for 10 minutes, leave in the cooker for 2 hours. Remove, add 
tomato or chopped vegetables, and cook 2 or 3 hours more. 

Corned Beef: Place meat in cold water, let come to a boil 
and simmer 30 minutes. Set into the larger kettle of boihng water 
and put away for 5 hours. Remove the lid and put in the prepared 
vegetables under the meat. Reheat and again pack for 3 hours. 



Roast Meats. 

In a hot, dry frying pan, sear the meat all over. Bake for 20 
minutes in a very hot oven, adding 2 cups of water. Put the roast 
in small kettle, season and place in the large pail of boiling water. 
Cover both kettles tight and let boil rapidly for 10 minutes. Pack 
for 3 or 4 hours. Reheat the meat and thicken the gravy. Chicken 
is particularly good this way. 

(For the cooker containing separate and distinct receptacles.) 

Cereals. 

Use less water than ordinarily required, since there is no loss 
by evaporation caused by escaping steam. Boil for 5 minutes and 
while still bubbling, pack into the cooker. Oatmeal boiled 2 min- 
utes may be left in all night and reheated in the morning. Rice, 
tapioca and sago require 2 hours. 

Macaroni with Cheese: Boil 10 minutes in milk and water 
(half and half), salt, cover with grated cheese, pack for 13^ hours. 



Soups. 

Stock for soups easily prepared by boiling a soup-bone, chicken 
bones, etc., a few minutes and pack 2 hours. 

Put the meat in cold water, boil, remove scum, add vege- 
tables and boil for 15 minutes. Pack for 3 to 5 hours, according 
to size. 



322 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Stews. 

Beef and Mutton Stews: Brown first, boil for 20 minutes, 
season and pack about 3 hours, according to size, or may be left 
longer. 

Roasts. 

They should be browned in butter on all sides, then enough 
water poured on to come halfway up the sides, covered and allowed 
to cook 3^ hour or so, then placed in the cooker 5 or 6 hours. They 
will not be crisp, but tender and juicy, and of fine flavor, 

(For the triple kettle cooker.) 

Another arrangement which does not require the box cooker 
and the results of which are delicious, is simplicity in itself. The 
recipes differ slightly from the preceding. 

Three kettles or enamel pails, fitting one within the other 
and leaving an inch space between each two are required. 

Place food to be cooked in the smallest kettle, add salt, but 
no water, except for dry cereals, which should be slightly moistened. 
Cover tightly. Place this in the next larger, which should contain 
about 3 inches of boiling water, put these 2 into the largest one, 
which should also hold about 4 inches of water. Put a large, 
tight-fitting lid over the whole and keep covered securely. Add 
a weight if necessary. Place the kettles over the fire and let boil 
rapidly for 5 minutes. Let stand until the food is cooked, depend- 
ing of course on the nature of the food. 

Meats require 3 or 4 hours. 

Vegetables require 2 hours. 

Cereals about 2 hours. 

The important jDoint in cooking by this method is that the 
water be kept hot. This can be ascertained by feeling the outer 
kettle, and in no case remove the lid until food is done. In the 
case of meats and other things requiring long cooking, boil the 
water a second time for 5 or 10 minutes, say at the end of 2 hours. 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 323 



CHAPTER XXV. 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 



"Simple diet is best, for many dishes bring many diseases." 

— Pliny. 



It is of especial importance that the greatest pains should be 
taken in the preparation of the invalid's food. It should be served 
in the most attractive way, never sending more than an amount 
sufficient for one meal. There may be a lack of desire for food, 
due merely to defective cooking, to the patient's dislike for a cer- 
tain food or to a meal presented at an inopportune moment. 

While it is unwise to ask the patient what he would like to 
eat, since the unexpected often pleases, yet it is desirable that 
there be frequent changes in order to tempt the appetite. 

Particular care should be exercised that the food selected be 
suitable to the patient's condition, as in the case of the very weak 
or fever patients when liquid food is more easily digested. 



Albuminized Orange. 

White of 1 egg; juice of 1 orange; sugar. Add the orange juice 
to the unbeaten white, sweeten and mix well. Strain and serve 
cold. 

Albuminized Sherry. 
White of 1 egg; 1 scant tablespoon Sherry; sugar. Beat the 
white to a stiff froth and while beating, add slowly the Sherry and 
sugar. Serve cold. 

Albuminized Grape Juice. 

Prepared the same as Sherry, using 2 tablespoons of juice to 
the white of 1 egg. 



324 THK MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

INVALID DISHES. 



Beef Juice. 

Select a thick cut of steak from the round or the rump and re- 
move all fat. Broil or heat long enough to start the juices, then 
extract the juice by means of a press or lemon squeezer. Season 
with salt and serve at once. Prepare only enough to serve, as it 
does not keep well. 

One pound of meat will yield ab )ut 5 ounces. Excellent, 
where solid foods cannot be taken. 



Beef Extract. 

One-half pound round steak; 3^ pint cold water; cut beef fine, 

put in cold water; let it stand where it will keep warm for a couple 

of hours, heat as hot as possible without boiling; squeeze the juice 

from beef; salt to suit. 

—An Old Nurse. 

Beef Scraped. 

Take a small piece of tender steak and with a sharp knife 
scrape off all the pulp until there remains only the tough fibres. 
Season slightly with salt and pepper, form into small cakes and 
broil 2 minutes. Serve on toast. 



Beef Tea (Quickly Made). 

Select a steak from the top cut of the round, as this has less 
fat and more juice than other cuts; remove all fat and cut into 
small pieces. Put in dry pan over a slow fire and allow it to sweat 
for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. The meat 
will become white and surrounded by a rich gravy. It may be 
given, in cases of great exhaustion, in this form. 

For 1 pound of beef allow a pint of water. Pour the water 
over the meat and stir until it boils; afterwards let simmer slowly 
5 or 10 minutes, strain and remove any particle of fat on top with 
a piece of brown paper. Does not require seasoning. 

Beef Tea. 

Allow 1 cujD of water to 3-^ pound of steak. Remove each par- 
ticle of fat; cut into small pieces, pour on the water and let stand 
about 15 minutes. Put into a tightly covered glass jar and set it 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 325 

into a kettle of cold water. Bring the water slowly to the boiling 
point and let boil 2 hours. Strain and season with salt. Remove 
any fat on top with paper or bread. 

May be served hot, or is very grateful to a fever patient when 
ice cold. 

BROTH. 

Broth is the liquid containing the juices of meat and bone, 
extracted by continued slow cooking. More nutriment is obtained 
from cheaper cuts than from the expensive parts. 

Best results are possible from the observation of the follow- 
ing rules: Cut meat into small pieces. Use cold water. Use steam- 
tight kettle, that there may be no waste by evaporation. If pos- 
sible, make the day before, when the fat may be more easily re- 
moved. Let simmer (not boil) until meat falls to pieces. In 
reheating, use double boiler. 

Mutton Broth. 

One quart of cold water to 1 pound of meat. Select the neck 
of mutton, remove skin and fat, cut into small pieces, pour on the 
water, let simmer until meat is in shreds. Remove fat and strain. 
Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot. One tablespoon of barley 
or rice (soaked over night) may be added if desired. Let barley 
simmer in the broth until the grains are tender. 

If possible, let broth stand all night, when the fat can be more 
easily removed. Excellent for those suffering from dysenteric 
troubles. 

Beef Broth. 

Prepared same as mutton broth. 

Veal Broth. 

Prepared same as mutton broth. 

Chicken Broth I. 

Same as mutton broth. 

Chicken Broth II. 

Cut a chicken mto small pieces, lay it in a deep earthen dish, 
add a quart of cold water and set it over a boiling kettle; cover 
closely and let it steam several hours, until the meat is very tender; 



326 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

strain off the broth and let it stand over night; in the morning skim 
off carefully all the fat, and pour out the broth into the bowl; into 
the deep dish put 3^3 of a cupful of rice in a cupful of cold water 
and steam as before until the rice is soft; pour in the broth and 
steam an hour or 2 longer; season to the taste of the invalid and 
serve hot. This is easily digested and very delicious. 

Oyster Broth. 
One cup chopped oysters; 1 cup cold water; 3^ cup hot milk; 
salt and pepper to taste; 1 Boston cracker, rolled fine. Put the 
oysters in the water, let them stand where they will slowly come 
to a boil, then strain in the milk; add the rolled crackers, salt and 
pepper. 

Chicken Broth Jelly. 

A 5-pound fowl should be prepared as for chicken broth. Let 
simmer 12 hours, strain while hot through a fine sieve, and season. 
Let cool on ice for 12 hours and remove fat. May be used full 
strength or diluted with water. 

Chicken Feet (for Jelly or Broth). 

Procure chickens' feet, cut off nails, pour over boiling water, 
let stand a few minutes and skim. Boil until they fall to pieces. 
Jelly or broth made from the feet, which is considered, according 
to a trained nurse, the most nutritious part of the fowl, is unsur- 
passed for invalids. 

Mutton Broth Jelly. 

Prepared the sarme as chicken broth jelly. 

Chicken Panada. 

Take a breast of cold chicken, put in a marble mortar and 
pound to a paste with a little of the broth (or chop very fine and 
add chicken broth). Season with salt and heat slowly to required 
consistency. It should be such as you can drink, though quite 
thick, or may be served with toast. 

Chicken Toast. 

Two tablespoons cold chicken, chopped fine; boil in sufficient 
water to make a cupful of the whole, thicken slightly with corn- 
starch in melted butter, pour over a slice of nicely toasted bread 
and serve hot. 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 327 

Caudle. 

Two tablespoons oatmeal; 1 quart water; butter, sugar, nut- 
meg, brandy or wine; 1 cup raisins; salt. Boil raisins in the water 
rapidly for Yi hour. Mix oatmeal with water to a smooth paste; 
add salt. After raisins have boiled enough, add oatmeal thicken- 
ing, let boil and skim well. Add sugar, butter, nutmeg, brand}^ 
or wine to taste when served. 



Cocoanut Milk or Cream. 

One cup grated cocoanut to 1 cup hot water. Select a cocoanut 
with plenty of water in it; clean and grate, discarding the water. 
To 1 cup of the grated nut add 1 cup of hot water, let stand a few 
minutes, strain through a thick cloth and squeeze well. This 
yields a thick cream. For cocoanut milk add more hot water to 
the pulp, squeeze and strain again. Use while fresh. Is dehcious 
with fruit and will not curdle. This milk is excellent for children 
and invalids who cannot use cow's milk. 



Egg-Nog. 

Break a fresh egg into a tumbler, add a heaping teaspoon 
sugar, beat very light, and fill up the tumbler with milk. A small 
glass of wine may be added or a little nutmeg. 

Where an invalid is required to take a raw egg daily, an egg-nog 
may be rendered more palatable by a variation in flavor. Add 
fruit juices to the beaten egg and sweeten. Never use milk with 
the fruit juice, but dilute with water. Raspberry, pineapple and 
orange are excellent. 

While egg-nog is extensively prescribed and very nutritious, 
there are cases where the combination is apt to produce nausea in 
a feeble stomach, especially in fever; consequently whole eggs are 
unfit for fever patients, and only the whites used. 



Egg Lemonade. 

Two eggs; sugar as desired; juice of 1 large lemon; 1 cup snow 
or pounded ice; put the yolks, sugar and lemon juice together, 
beat them well and add the well beaten whites of the eggs with 
the snow or ice; beat the whole well together and add water enough 
to make a pint; drink through a glass tube. 



328 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Egg Nests. 
Separate an egg, beat the white until stiff, add a Httle salt, 
put into a large cup and in center drop the unbroken yolk. Place 
in pan of hot water, let boil until white of egg is set. May also be 
placed on buttered rounds of toast and put in oven 3 minutes. 

"WITH EICE. 

Butter a glass, line with boiled rice, put in the stiffly beaten 
white and in the center place the yolk. Put in oven long enough 
to set the white. 

Eggs and Rum (Milk Punch). 

One cup fresh milk; 1 tablespoon sugar; yolk 1 egg; 1 table- 
spoon rum; pinch salt; little nutmeg. Beat yolk, add sugar, nut- 
meg and salt; then add milk and rum. Taken by consumptives, 
early in the morning, often prevents the exhausting morning sweats. 

Egg Gruel. 

Boil eggs until hard enough to grate. Scald milk, add grated 
egg to the hot milk and season with salt. Excellent, if patient is 
nauseated. 

Flour Gruel. 

One cup milk; \^ tablespoon flour; 1 dozen seeded raisins; 
pinch salt. Scald th^ milk and stir in the flour which has been 
mixed with a little cold milk. Cook 3^ hour in double boiler. Cut 
the raisins in small pieces and with enough water to cover, cook 
slowly until the water has boiled away. Season the gruel and add 
raisins. This is slightly astringent. May be prepared without the 
raisins, which should never be used in cases of bowel troubles. 

Barley Gruel. 

Two tablespoons barley flour; 1 quart scalded milk; salt. 
Mix the barley flour with a little cold milk and stir it into the 
scalding milk. Cook 2 hours in a double boiler. Season to taste, 
and sweeten, if desired. Strain. 

Barley Gruel with Broth. 

Two cups beef broth; 2 tablespoons barley flour; 2 tablespoons 
cold water; 1 saltspoon salt. Mix the flour and the water to a 
smooth paste, add salt, pour slowly into the boihng broth and let 
boil Yi hour. Strain and serve hot. 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 329 

Arrowroot Gruel. 

Two teaspoons arrowroot; 2 tablespoons cokl water; sugar, 
wine, brandy or lemon juice, as desired; 1 cup boiling water or milk; 
salt. Mix the arrowroot and water to a paste. Pour into the boil- 
ing water or milk. Cook for 2 hours in a double boiler. 

Season, strain and serve hot. Beneficial in diarrhoea cases. 

Indian Meal Gruel. 

One tablespoon Indian meal; 2 tablespoons cold water; 3^ 
pint boiling water; salt; nutmeg; sugar, if desired. Mix to a smooth 
paste meal, salt and cold water. Stir slowly into the boiling water. 
Let simmer 13^ hours. Strain. May be diluted with milk or cream. 

Rice Gruel. 

Prepared same as Indian meal gruel, using 1 quart boiling 
water. 

Oatmeal Gruel I. 

(Good to use in typhoid fever cases). One cup well cooked 
oatmeal, while hot add 1 cup milk, 1 cup hot water; beat together 
thoroughly, strain through wire strainer; add salt, if desired. 

Oatmeal Gruel II. 

Take Yi cup of oatmeal, pound in a mortar until mealy (or 
rub hard with a httle cold water). Put it into a glass, stir well and 
pour off the milky water into a sauce pan. Again fill the glass, 
pour off and repeat as long as water looks mealy. Set sauce pan 
where it will simmer for 1 hour (in double boiler 2 hours). Strain. 
Season with salt, add sugar, if desired. Thin with milk, if too thick. 

Dried or Boiled Flour Gruel. 

Tie y^ cupful of flour in bag and boil about 3 hours. Take out, 
dry in the sun or oven until it is hard. Grate it when needed, us- 
ing 1 tablespoon to a pint of milk, and stir over the fire until it 
comes to a boil. Add salt, a little cold water and serve. Especially 
good for children afflicted with summer complaint. 

Barley Jelly. 

Three tablespoons pearl barley; salt; 1 quart water. Soak the 
barley over night, strain, pour on a quart of water, add salt and 



330 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

boil 4 hours in a double boiler. Strain through a cloth. Thin the 
jelly when cold with warm and sweetened milk, in the proportion 
of the tablespoons of jelly to 1 cup of milk. 



Rice Jelly. 

One and one-half tablespoons rice; % cup milk; salt. Wash 
the rice and let stand in cold water about 2 hours. Drain, add milk 
and cook for 13^ hours in a double boiler. Strain, add salt, let stand 
until cold and serve with sugar and cream or fruit juices. 



Tapioca Jelly. 
One teacup pearl tapioca; 1 quart cold water; pinch of salt; 
lemon juice or wine. Thoroughly wash the tapioca and pour over 
it the quart of cold water. Let soak 3 or 4 hours and simmer until 
it becomes quite clear, stirring often. Serve hot with cream, sugar 
and wine, or while hot, add lemon juice and chill. 



Cracker Panada. 

Three or 4 crackers; 1 quart water; sugar; salt. Break the 
crackers into pieces and bake brown. Boil 15 minutes in the quart 
of water and let stand 3 or 4 minutes. Strain through a fine wire 
sieve, add salt and a httle sugar. 

For infants that are teething this is a nourishing beverage and 
for invalids recovering from a fever is often prescribed with the 
addition of a little wine and nutmeg. 



Flaxseed Tea. 

One tablespoon whole flaxseed; sugar; 2 cups cold water; 
juice 1 lemon. Thoroughl}^ wash flaxseed. Put into sauce pan, 
add cold water and let simmer 1 hour. Add lemon juice and 
sweeten to taste. Strain. If too thick, dilute with hot water. 



Flaxseed and Licorice Tea. 

One ounce flaxseed; 1 pint boiling water; 2 drachms licorice- 
root. Over the flaxseed and licorice-root pour the boiling water 
and let simmer very slowly for 4 hours. Strain. Excellent in fever 
cases accompanied by a cough. 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 331 

Toast Water. 

Toast bread as brown as possible without burning. Cover with 
boiHng water and season with salt. Let stand about 1 hour and 
strain through cheese cloth. Serve hot or cold. May be flavored 
with orange or lemon peel or a glass of white wine added and 
grated nutmeg. Valuable in cases of fever or extreme nausea. 



Hop Tea. 

Take 1 large spoonful of hops, add 1 pint of cold water, let 
simmer. When sufficiently strong, strain, sweeten and add a 
tablespoon of gin. This is a quieting drink and most excellent for 
a nervous headache. 



RECIPES FOR THE BABY. 

"No particular diet can be recommended for the infant that 
is so unfortunate as to be deprived of its natural nourishment. 
What agrees with one is quite unsuccessful with another. Differ- 
ent kinds of diet can only be tested. Children's little illnesses are 
often the result of food which, in their case, is unassimilating and 
indigestible, and it is often better to attempt a change of food 
than to resort to medicines." 

— Mrs. Henderson. 

Some babies have strong digestive organs and thrive on cow's 
milk straight and undiluted. Some require it to be diluted with 
^ water, and some require lime water in addition. Some babies 
thrive well on goat's milk when they can take no other. It is al- 
ways safer to consult the physician, but many of them are able only 
to experiment and succeed in finding the right food only after re- 
peated failures. Whey seems to be the almost absolutely unfailing 
diet, mixed with cream or top milk when everything else fails. 
The amount of cream or milk to use with whey should always be 
j^rescribed by the physician. 



Baby Food. 

Junket tablets are especially valuable in preparing food for 
infants as a means of modifying milk. They are handy in prepar- 
ing whey and are an aid to digestion in any preparation of milk 
or cream. 



332 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Mrs. Rorer's Recipe for Preparing Infant Food. 

Where cow's milk, even when dihited, or partly modified, as 
in the home fashion, disagrees with the infant, this mixture may 
be used with good results: Heat 2 quarts of milk to 100 degrees F. 
Add 2 of Chr. Hansen's junket tablets dissolved in a tablespoonful 
of cold water. When the milk is congealed and perfectly solid 
draw through it backwards and forwards an ordinary four-tined 
silver fork; this will separate the curd. Strain through 2 thick- 
nesses of cheese cloth, saving the whey as this is the part you are 
to use; add a pint of water, a half ounce of sugar of milk, 3 ounces 
of cream and 4 ounces of the white of egg. The whites may be 
dropped into a quart fruit jar, a pint of the whey added, the top 
screwed on and the jar thoroughly shaken until the whites are well 
mixed with the whey; then add them to the remaining quantity, 
and stand at once in a very cold place. This will be given in quan- 
tities of from 2 to 3 ounces in an ordinary nursing bottle. This 
albuminized whey forms one of the most easily digested and valued 
of all foods for convalescing patients. With the cream and sugar 
of milk omitted, it may be used successfully in tyjihoid and kindred 
fevers. 

Whey. 

To prepare whey temper fresh milk until luke warm, 85 de- 
grees to 100 degrees F; to each quart add 1 junket tablet dis- 
solved in cold water and stir it in quickly. Leave the milk at rest 
in a warm place 15 minutes" or until firmly thickened. When per- 
fectly firm, put into cheese cloth and drain off the whey. As the 
butter fat is retained in the curd, and does not go into the whey, 
skimmed milk will answer the purpose as well as new milk. But 
whether new or skimmed, the milk must be perfectly fresh, as 
otherwise the whey is apt to be sour. Cool immediately when the 
whey has drained from the curd. Use quickly or keep in the re- 
frigerator. Whey may be considered mildly nutritive and very 
wholesome; if fresh it is readily assimilated by the stomach, requir- 
ing no labor to fit it for absorption, and contains in a degree every 
element of nutrition. Whey is strongly recommended as a most 
satisfactory food in case of cholera infantum and is far more suit- 
able than any other food preparation as a temporary substitute 
for milk. For adult invahds whey is a most pleasing and nutritious 
drink. 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 333 

Cream and Whey Mixture. 
One ounce of cream; 7 ounces of whey; 2 tablespoons milk 
sugar. The amount of cream will have to be varied with the age 
and needs of the child, and should be recommended b}- the physi- 
cian. 

— Ceozier Griffith. 

Barley Water. 
Boil \}/2 tablespoons of whole barley in water for 5 minutes, 
drain off the water and throw it away, then add to the barley 1 
quart of water and cook or simmer it slowly down to 1 pint. Re- 
move from stove and strain. It is a substitute for milk in sickness. 



Albumen Water. 

Dissolve slowly the raw white of 1 egg in a glass of cold w^ater. 
Strain it only if necessary to prevent clogging the rubber nipple. 
Sweeten, if desired, and warm it only slightly before giving. This 
is good as a temporary nourishment when milk cannot be taken. 

— Crozier Griffith. 

Beef Juice. 

Take 1 pound of round or tenderloin steak (free from fat), 
season with salt and sear over in a hot skillet or broil slightly. 
Then cut it into small pieces and squeeze out the juice with a fruit 
press or lemon squeezer. It may be given cold or warmed slightly. 
It may be sweetened a little. 

Sterilized Milk. 

Fill small necked 3^ pint bottles to within 13^ inches of the 
top with milk. Cork with absorbent cotton. Stand in a steamer 
of cold w^ater, having the water to surround bottles to ^ their 
height. Heat the water gradually until nearly to boiling point and 
keep at this temperature for 10 minutes. When used for infants, 
allow from a teaspoon to a tablespoon for each bottle of milk.

How to Prepare Plain Junket. 

Drop 1 junket tablet and a tablespoon of cold water into a cup 
and crush with a spoon to dissolve thoroughly. Heat 1 quart of 
pure milk until hike-warm, about 98 degrees F. — no more; add 



334 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

sugar iincl flavor to taste and, if desired, a trifle of 1 of the junket 
colors. Add the dissolved junket tablet to the hike-warm milk and 
stir it in quickly. Pour into junket glasses or saucers, or into a 
large dish. Let stand undisturbed in a warm room until firm. Re- 
move carefully, without shaking, to a cold place or the refrigerator 
and let stand until time to serve. Serve with or without cream. 



Junket for Children. 

Prepare as for plain junket; pour into a large pudding dish in- 
stead of individual junket glasses; dish carefully in serving so as 
not to break the jelly too much. If preferred, it can be made with- 
out sweetening or flavor and served with sugar and grated nutmeg 
or cinnamon sprinkled over it. Children will often eat a quantity 
of this delicious dish, and may be allowed it, as it is very nutritious 
as well as inexpensive. Milk being the one perfect food for infants, 
it becomes, when made into junket, the ideal health food for grow- 
ing children. No other food contains so much true nourishment 

in proper proportion, or is so easily digested.

The Spengler Cooker 

or Heat Distributor is an appliance which phicetl over one burner 
of a Gas — Gasoline — Alcohol or Blue Flame Oil Stove positively 
cooks, not merely keeps warm, three articles in three separate good 
sized, regular Utensils with but One Gas Flame. One flame instead 
of three means gross saving 66 2-3 per cent, gas consumed. 

A liberal allowance for slight excess time to start things boil- 
ing, over direct flame method, privileges us to state, without fear 
of honest contradiction, that each and every housewife who uses 
the SPENGLER COOKER will positively reduce her bill for cook- 
ing by Gas over 50 per cent. Does it appeal to you? 

REMEMBER 

besides cutting your "Cooking by gas" 
bills in half The Spengler Cooker posi- 
tively avoids the chance of scorching 
cereals, soups and milk. 

You can well afford to "buy" for 
this reason alone. No contact with 
the direct flame solves this problem. 

For the very same reason your 
Enameled and other cooking ware will last until worn out. The 
"old wav" on direct flame, "Burns it up in no time."

HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 337 



CHAPTER XXVI. 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 



"Little drops of knowledge, 
Little grains of sense 

Solve the mighty problem 
Of the home expense." 



Cooking Hints. 

When making gravy, remove the pan from the fire while the 
thickening is being stirred in, and when smooth return to the fire 
to cook. This will prevent lumps forming. Cook at least 10 min- 
utes longer to cook the flour. 

Add a little sugar when making pie crust to make it crisp and 
brown. 

If you put a piece of horseradish root into a jar of pickles, the 
vinegar will retain its strength longer and the pickles will be less 
likely to become soft and mold. 

To keep potatoes warm after pouring off the water and shak- 
ing, cover the jjotatoes with a folded towel. 

When vegetables such as parsnips, carrots, string beans, etc., 
are boiling, drop in a pinch of soda; pour off the water and replace 
with boiling water. Will make the vegetables more tender. 



Washing and Ironing. 

If a few drops of glycerine be added to the starch for linens, 
it will be found that the iron will not stick and the linen will have 
a beautiful gloss after being ironed. 

Rusty flatirons should be rubbed over with beeswax and lard 
or beeswax and salt. 

Fine laces and sheer handkerchiefs may be laundered like new 
without being ironed. Wash in suds by squeezing in the hands. 
Rinse, and if desired, dip in a thin starch. Have the inside of a 



338 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

window pane perfectly clean and spread articles out on the glass, 
smoothing out every wrinkle. It will stick to the glass and dry 
in a short time. Fine lace work should never be ironed. 

When starching black wash dresses and petticoats add bluing 
enough to make the starch a deep blue. 

If the button side of waists is ironed in a folded bath towel, 
buttons turned downward, they will be prevented from breaking 
and are more easily ironed. 

If cloth is scorched when ironing, dip immediately in hot 
water. 

Stains — To Remove Stains From White Cloth. 

Fruit stains: Pour on boiling hot water. 

Cocoa and blood stains: Soak in cold water. 

Ink stains: Rub spot with salt, then wet with ammonia. 

Grass stains: Rub with butter or molasses. 

Car grease: Rub with laundry soap and wash in kerosene. 

Ink stains from fountain pen and iron rust: Rub with lemon 
juice, sprinkle with salt, then lay in the sun. 

Paint stains: Rub with turpentine or benzine. 

Coffee stains : Rub with glycerine. 

Alcohol will remove candle grease. 

If you should accidentally sit on sticky fly paper, apply gaso- 
line. 

Rub grease stains on hard wood floors with soda. 

Rub spoons with common salt to remove egg stains. 

Rub mildew marks over with a piece of raw tomato. Sprinkle 
with salt and lay in the sun. Repeat the process, if necessary. 



Vermin. 

For moths, dissolve Y^ pound gum camphor in 13^ gallon of 
benzine and use freely with an atomizer. 

Oil of red cedar is good to drive away mosquitoes, moths and 
ants. Soak in wads of cotton. 

To keep ants out of a refrigerator, fill baking powder can covers 
with water and place under castors. Cut a piece of newspaper a little 
larger than bottom of your sugar crock and place on a sheet of 
sticky fly paper. Put your crock on this and your sugar will be 
free from ants. 

A small quantity of green sage placed in the pantry will keep 
out red ants. 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 339 

Fill rat holes with laundry soap or cayenne pepper. 

Allspice freely used will kill buffalo bugs. 

This ant remedy is guaranteed to succeed when all others fail. 
Mix 1 teaspoon tartar emetic, 1 teaspoon sugar with 34 cupful of 
water, put' in saucers and set saucers around in the cupboard. 

Remedies. 

The juice of 3^ a lemon squeezed into a glass of w\ater, taken 
in the morning without sugar, is a simple remedy for torpid liver. 

Lemon juice mixed very thickly with sugar will relieve a tick- 
ling cough. 

For sore throat, gargle with 1 part alcohol and 3 parts water. 

Dip a woolen cloth in alcohol, wring out, and place on the 
chest to relieve croup. 

Keep on hand Hydrogen Peroxide for cuts, and Carbolated 
vaseline for bruises. 

Rubbing bruises after applying ointment will prevent swelling. 

Soaking feet in hot water and salt relieves tired nerves. 

For chilblains, rub the parts affected with brandy and salt. 

The raw white of an egg applied to a burn will take out heat. 

Ammonia applied to the bites of insects, such as fleas, mos- 
quitoes, etc., will stop the itching at once. 

One tablespoonful of olive oil after each meal will increase 
the flesh. 

Miscellaneous. 

Turpentine mixed with stove polish prevents rust and gives a 
brighter gloss than the use of water. 

In packing white lace or white silk waists or gowns, if you 
wish them to remain perfectly white, wrap in light blue cheese- 
cloth or tissue paper and place in a box. 

If you have no ice and want to cool hot w^ater in a short time, 
put the water in an air-tight jar and place under cold running 
water. It will be ice cold in 20 minutes. 

A large case, similar to a pillow case, made of unbleached cot- 
ton, for mattresses that can be taken off and washed, saves much 
time in cleaning them. 

To make false hair puffs, switches and pompadours look like 
new, wash in gasoline and rinse in clean gasohne; hang in open air 
to dry. 

To dry lettuce quickly and make it crisp, wash and place in a 
thin cloth and shake in the open air. 



340 • THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Use a clothespin instead of a stick, when stringing nastur- 
tiums or sweet peas. 

Save broken gas mantles. They make fine silver polish. 

If blankets are too short during the cold weather, sew a piece 
of canton flannel to one end for the "tuck in." 

To remove adhesive plaster, wet with alcohol. 

A mustard plaster mixed entirely with white of egg will neither 
scar nor blister. 

To color curtains ecru, buy a little yellow ochre. Pour boil- 
ing water on the ochre and mix in starch. 

Use kerosene in water to clean window glass and painted 
woodwork. 

Use a little ammonia or alcohol in the water to clean glass of 
pictures, etc. 

Place a thimble or the finger of an old glove on the end of the 
curtain rod when running it through a freshly starched curtain. 

To keep a broom firm, before using it soak in boiling hot water 
or soapsuds for 3^ hour. 



THE HOT BEDS AND COLD FRAMES OF A KITCHEN GARDEN. 341 



CHAPTER XXVII 



THE HOTBEDS AND COLD FRAMES 
OF A KITCHEN GARDEN 



'Who loves the Garden loves the Greenhouse, too." 

— Cooper. 



The kitchen garden is the housewife's constant friend, so why 
not make an effort to begin early with a hotbed and a little later 
with a cold frame, thus securing the delicious young vegetables 
ahead of the markets and our neighbors, provided they are not as 
thrifty as we? Think of the pleasure of taking them some crisp 
heads of lettuce, some tender radishes, or some juicy rhubarb for 
their Christmas dinner. With the hotbed this is made quite pos- 
sible. 

The hotbed may be started about December first, and for the 
benefit of our friends who have had no experience in this mode of 
gardening, we will give a few dimensions and suggestions for mak- 
ing, culled from "The Garden Magazine." 

First, choose a spot having a southern exposure, well pro- 
tected from the north and west winds, and where the natural 
drainage is away from the bed. 

Dig out a space the size of frame so that when the frame is set 
up the interior space is four feet deep. Posts 2x4 set firmly in each 
corner and at intervals on each side serve as supports for the frame. 

The dimensions of a practical frame are 9 ft. 2 in x 5 ft. 6 in., 
2 feet high in the rear and 18 inches high in front. Two strips 
across the top serve as rests for the sash, which in buying the com- 
mercial size (3x6), requires three. Now for the bed. The heating 
material is composed of fresh horse manure about 3 feet in depth. 
Drench well with water, then close frame for a few days in order 
to heat thoroughly. After this process the soil (which is equal 
parts of good sifted garden loam and well rotted manure) is thrown 



342 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

in to the depth of 4 or 5 inches. The frame must be well protected 
on the outside from frosts and cold weather by banking with ma- 
nure and straw. 

The temperature during ordinary weather should be from 50 
to 60 degrees, but in cold or stormy weather the glass should be 
covered with burlap, matting or straw. Should the temperature 
rise to 85 degrees or more, this must be regulated by raising the 
sash a little with small blocks of wood kept for that purpose. A 
general rule to follow is, open the sash on pleasant mornings about 
an hour after sunrise, and close 1 or 2 hours before sundown. On 
cold, stormy days it is best to let the bed alone. 

After planting seeds, sprinkle with hike warm water along the 
rows; keep moist, but not wet. Lettuce, radishes, onions, carrots, 
spinach, parsley, rhubarb and asparagus should be put in first and 
planted in succession in order to keep the table supplied. 

The cold frames are generally used later. Transplanting the 
plants from the hotbed, cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, melons, 
cucumbers, etc., are started ready for garden transplanting, or left 
in cold frames to mature, provided there is space enough. 

The cold frames are not made with as much heating material 
as the hotbed — a good rich loam will answer the purpose. An ex- 
cellent article on how to manage a cold frame is given in the March 
1907 number of "The Garden Magazine," to which we refer any 
interested, as lack of space forbids more on this subject. 

Rhubarb can be forced any time after December 1st in the 
hotbed or warm cellar where the light and heat are good. The 
roots should be slightly frozen before taken up. Bring in and 
place on the cellar floor covered until thawed out; they are then 
ready for planting. If not planted in the hotbed, plant in good 
rich soil in boxes, using broken crocks or cinders- for drainage, and 
cover the tops with about 3 or 4 inches of soil. Care must be taken 
not to water the leaves, yet keep the ground moist. The temper- 
ature required is only 50 or 60 degrees. With care, there might 
be a rhubarb pie for the New Year's dinner. 

March is the month to think of the outdoor garden, also plant- 
ing of seeds in the hotbed for this garden when all danger of frosts 
is over. Tomatoes, eggplants, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, pep- 
pers, even cucumbers and melons may thus be given an early start, 
which enables one to have many good vegetables before summer 
droughts deprive us of much, and cause us to think it was love's 
labor lost. 



THE HOTBEDS AND COLD FRAMES OF A KITCHEN GARDEN. 343 

However, it is worth trying for the joy it brings in; the early 
season fully compensates us for later losses, when the rains will 
not descend to warrant plenty of vegetables for the winter. 



THE KITCHEN GARDEN. 



"Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted; 
Suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden, 
And choke the herbs for the want of husbandry." 

— Shakespeare. 



How eagerly we look forward to the first green stuff from the 
garden in the spring! While the radishes, onions, lettuce, spinach, 
etc., are still in the hotbeds safe from frosts, up comes the hardy 
rhubarb and asparagus in defiance of the hoary King. How hard 
it is to have 1,000 asparagus plants, and have to wait until the 
third year before you can cut all you want of it! Next comes the 
juicy onion sets, and the greens in quick succession, and berry 
time has arrived. That means a celebration, for the strawberries 
out of our own patch are always the sweetest we ever ate. Then 
comes the peas, and beans and tomatoes and golden August brings 
the sweet corn, when there are corn roasts and corn is dried for 
winter. September brings the melons! There's a wrenching of 
the heart and stomach if one has to be away in melon time! Then 
the grapes have to be eaten and canned and made into grape juice, 
jellies, etc. Now comes a hint of frost and everything is gathered 
into the big cellar and stored for future use. 

So in seed time and harvest, all through the cycle of the 
months we are continually reminded of the useful kitchen garden. 
Vegetables are divided into several different classes. 
Under pot herbs or greens comes: Asparagus, cabbage, cauli- 
flower, brussels sprouts, swiss chard, spinach, beet, kale, mustard, 
dandelions. 

The sweet herbs are: Summer and winter savory, thyme, sage, 
mint, parsley, tarragon, sweet marjoram. 

The salad plants are: Lettuce, radish, celery, water cress, 
pepper grass, curled cress, endive, dandehon, corn salad, chicory, 
cardoon, borage, garden sorrel, chives and mustard. 



344 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

The seeds and fruits are: Peas, corn, cucumbers, egg plant, 
okra, musk melon, watermelon, pepper, pumpkin, squash and 
tomato. 

The vegetable roots which can be stored for winter are: Beets, 
carrots, celeraic, horseradish, Jerusalem artichokes, kohlrabi, pars- 
nips, potatoes, rutabagas, salsify, scolymus, scorzonera, white 
turnips, winter radish, leeks, onions and garlic. 

The garden would not be complete without: Strawberries, 
raspberries, blackberries, currants, gooseberries, and grapes. 

The flavor of kale is improved by freezing. 

Scorzonera much resembles salsify and the roots are prepared 
and eaten exactly the same way. 

Celeriac is a variety of celery that has edible roots instead of 
leaves. It is used for soups, stews and salads. 

The leaf of borage is used in any way in which cucumber is 
used as a flavoring, for the taste is identical. 

Endive, when well grown, must be tied up on a dry day, so 
the hearts will be blanched. 

When cutting sweet herbs for drying, the leaves must be 
picked just before blossoming time and when the sun is shining. 

Brussels sprouts should be started in the hotbed and set out 
later, for frosts often kill them before they have matured. They 
require 150 days. 

Sow corn salad out doors in September, cover lightly with lit- 
ter, and you will have a salad from the garden in March or before 
snow melts. 

Mustard is a welcome salad in late fall and can be raised from 
seed sown in August. Mustard for salad is ready in 10 days; for 
greens, about 30 days. 

Spraying with ice cold water and protecting from sun will 
nearly always save a slightly frozen plant. 

We are indebted to the Garden Magazine for our information.

TABLE ETIQUETTE AND MENUS. 341 



CHAPTER XXVIII. 



TABLE ETIQUETTE AND MENUS 



"The true essentials of a feast are only fun and feed." 

— Holmes. 



SETTING THE TABLE. 

In setting the table let this rule be followed first, last and all 
the time — have the table linen spotlessly white and of the finest 
quahty that you can possibly afford to buy. The chief charm of any 
table lies in its neatness and daintiness. It is much better economy 
to buy firm, fine, thick table linen even if the cost is higher, than 
to buy the coarse, loosely woven, thin linens as the latter do not 
wear nearly as long. Always use a thick table pad of material 
which comes for this purpose (the thicker the better) under the 
tablecloth. This pad should extend 3 or 4 inches over the table 
all around as it thus prevents the tablecloth from wearing out 
where the edge of the table comes. This pad is called a "silencer" 
as it deadens the noise and makes a more refined table. It also 
protects a handsome polished wood table. Table linen should not 
be starched. For the family alone, have the table as spotless as 
for company. Generally it is only at meal time that the entire 
family is assembled together, and the refining influence of home 
can be taught in no surer or better way than by neatness and dainti- 
ness of table and cheerfulness and good manners at table. Leave 
all care, worry and anger outside of the dining room. This should 
be the happiest place in the home, as it is the most necessary. Be 
perfect in table deportment always. I would say to young parents 
that one of the most important lessons which they should teach 
their children is perfect table manners, and to require of them al- 
ways to be particular even when only the family is present, then 
when company comes there will be no fear that Johnnie will stick 
his fingers in the pickle dish or that Susie will take her pie up in 
her hand to eat. The handling of the knife and fork when using 



348 THE MEiSTDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

and the proper placing of them on the plate when through, stamp 
the seal of early training and good breeding wherever it is seen. It 
is said that the Empress Eugenie of France was so punctilious 
about table etiquette that she never invited a gentleman a second 
time to dine who more than half unfolded his napkin or placed it 
other than over his left knee. 

Square, oblong or round tables are used, but the latter lend 
themselves better for effects in table decorations and show off a 
good dinner to the best advantage. A round table top of pine, 
hinged in the center so as to fold when not in use, is very conven- 
ient to place on the dining table to enlarge it. A top measuring 7 
feet in diameter will seat 12 people, the rule being to allow 20 in- 
ches to a person. It is good form to use either a round or square 
tablecloth for a round table. 

The service plate, knives, forks, spoons, glasses and napkin 
for each guest constitute the Cover. The service plate should be 
the handsomest plate you have and should be 10 inches in diame- 
ter. It is placed on the table before dinner is announced, and is 
left on until the meat course. Although the dernier cri concern- 
ing this plate is that it be left on the table through the dinner until 
the dessert. It is good form to do either. On the right of the serv- 
ice plate place one, two or three knives as may be required for fish, 
meat and game, with the sharp edge toward the plate and in the 
order in which they will be used, beginning at the outside. At the 
right of the knives place the soup or bouillon spoon and at its right 
the small fork for oysters or canapes. The forks should be placed 
at the left of the service plate with the ice cream or dessert fork 
next to the plate, then the salad fork, game fork, large fork for the 
roast and the fish fork at the extreme left. Place spoons for sher- 
bet and coffee above the service plate. If a spoon is used for ice 
cream or dessert instead of a fork, place it above the plate. Above 
and at the right of the plate place the goblet for water and arrange 
wine glasses just beside and a little back of the goblet. If there 
is room, place the napkin at the left of the forks with a roll, or thick 
piece of bread cut narrow and with the crust removed, between 
the folds. If there is not room, place it upon the service plate. 
Dinner cards containing the name of the guest should be laid upon 
the napkin. Individual dishes for salted nuts should be filled and 
placed above the forks at the left of the service plate. 

Dinner cards may be decorated in any dainty way to match 
the general scheme of decoration, but those most used at present 
are plain white cards with the monogram or crest of the hostess 



TABLE ETIQUETTE AND MENUS. 349 

in gold at the top. Menu cards are seldom, if ever used, at private 
tables now. If one has pretty little dishes of silver or Venetian 
glass they may be filled with salted nuts, and candy or confections, 
generally tinted the color of the decorations and placed on the table. 
Butter plates are not used for dinners. Finger bowls are not used 
as much as formerly. When used, they should be put on a small 
plate on which has been placed a dainty doily. They should be 
half filled with water on top of which floats a geranium leaf or a 
sprig of lemon verbena as these leave a pleasant odor on the fingers. 
Never require two guests to use the same finger bowl. Extreme 
simpHcity combined with artistic effect is the rule at present for 
table decorations except for special occasions when one can let 
their fancy run riot as it is understood by the guests that it is for 
the occasion only. The day of profuse use of ribbons has gone by. 
Flowers, ferns, fruits or softly shaded candles together with spark- 
ling glass, shining silver and snowy linen makes a beautiful, 
aesthetic picture. Flowers may cost more than their weight in 
gold if orchids are used, or they may be plucked in the woods or 
by the wayside and be equally beautiful and attractive. Thirty- 
six guests at a charming breakfast party were seated at round tables 
in three different rooms. One table was gorgeous where a center 
piece of bright pink roses formed the color note. Brilliant yellow 
daffodils adorned another table, but the third and by far the most 
beautiful table contained a large cut glass bowl filled with the 
roadside flower called "Queen's Lace Handkerchief," its dainty 
white blossoms beautiful as the cobweb affair which such a 
handkerchief is supposed to be, with maiden hair ferns noth- 
ing more exquisite can be imagined. It cost the hostess only a 
pleasant trip to the outskirts of town whei'e she found plenty to 
be had for the picking. The beautiful field daisies grow wild nearly 
all summer. Placed in cut glass bowls and used with gold banded 
china they make most attractive table decoration. If one has a 
beautiful center-piece of lace or embroidered linen it may be placed 
on the tablecloth under the bowl, vase or basket containing the 
flowers, and table mirrors are also used. Floral decorations should 
be low when guests are to be seated, but high effects may be used 
when guests stand. Be careful and do not have the illumination 
too brilliant; softly shaded fights or candles are more becoming 
and in better taste. 



350 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Serving. 

When everything is ready the hostess very quietly announces 
the fact to those nearest to her and together they start towards 
the dining room, thus giving the signal for the others to follow. 
It is extremely bad form for the host to announce in stentorian 
tones to the assembled company that "dinner is served," as this 
should be done by the butler alone, and his place should not be 
usurped. In this country where few people keep a butler, this 
public announcement should be omitted. The seat of honor for 
ladies is at the right of the host and for gentlemen at the right of 
the hostess. When all have been seated the serving should proceed 
as quietly as possible, and no matter what may happen or what 
accident may occur, the hostess should never betray any nervous- 
ness, nothing is more distressing to guests than to see a hostess ill 
at ease and anxious. Plates, whether filled or empty, should al- 
ways be placed upon the table from the right side of each person 
and removed from the same side, but all platters or dishes to be 
served from, should be presented at the left side. The tray is not 
now used in passing and removing plates but instead, a squarely 
folded napkin is held by the waiter under the plate. The hostess 
should always be served first. Do not remove all of the plates at 
the end of a course before serving the following course, but in- 
stead, a plate for the next course should be exchanged for the one 
which has just been used, thus leaving a plate continually in front 
of each person. Remove and serve only one plate at a time, never pile 
plates upon each other. The crumb scraper is seldom used at for- 
mal dinners, but if necessary, it should be just before the dessert. 
The waitress should be gowned in black with stiff white collar and 
outside cuffs, a white apron with bretelles over the shoulder trim- 
med with lace or embroidery or simply hemstitched, and a little 
cap or bow of white muslin on the head. Unless a professional 
caterer is engaged the menu should be plainly written out by the 
hostess, together with a list of dishes to be used, and pinned up in 
the kitchen so as to avoid confusion or forgetfulness on the part 
of the cook. 



TABLE ETIQUETTE AND MENUS. 35l 

The Formal Dinner. 

The formal dinner party is the most ceremonial function which 
can be given. Some of the courses are arranged on the plates be- 
fore being brought to the dining room, other courses are artistic- 
ally arranged on platters, garnished and passed, the necessary 
forks and spoons for serving them lying on the top a little to one 
side. Oysters or clams should be served on the half shell for a for- 
mal dinner. If canapes are used they take the place of the oysters 
or clams and should be arranged on small plates before being brought 
to the table. The soup or bouillon is usually served in the soup 
plates or bouillon cups before being brought in, the soup tureen 
is not generally used for formal dinners. The fish, meat, game, 
salad and dessert may be served according to the desire of the 
hostess, either by having the plates filled and garnished in the 
kitchen or from a beautifully garnished platter at the table. The 
latter way is most popular as there is much attention paid to garn- 
ishings at present. Sherbet follows the meat course or is served 
with it. It is served in fancy glasses. It is quite customary to 
serve a vegetable salad with the game and only vegetable or fruit 
salads should be served at a dinner. The lighter and more simple 
the salad for a dinner, the better. Fruit should be arranged and 
passed in a fruit dish or comport. Cheese with Bar le Due cur- 
rants and wafers are appropriate at both dinners and luncheons. 
Nuts and raisins are not used as much as formerly at dinners. 
Coffee should be clear and strong, served in small cups from the 
kitchen or poured at the table by the hostess. The cup should 
be placed at the right hand of the guest and cream and sugar passed 
on a small tray at the left. Sauce dishes should not be used at 
formal dinners, all vegetables should be served dry and taken 
upon the plate. It is quite customary to serve the coffee in the 
drawing room after dinner, instead of serving it at the table, in 
which case it is brought in with the coffee service on a tray and 
poured from the coffee pot either by the hostess or maid. Salted 
nuts are eaten during the dinner and candy or confections passed 
after the last course. It is not fashionable now to have more than 
six or eight courses at the most formal dinners. The old daj^s 
when twenty and even twenty-five courses were served, and the 
hospitality of the host was reckoned by the number of hours which 
he kept his guests at table, have gone, let us hope never to return. 
Dinners should be served expeditiously, but without seeming haste. 
Each course should be ready on time, a dragging dinner is tire- 
some. At the close of the dinner the signal is given bv the hostess 



352 THK MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

pushing her chair back from the table, the others rise and foUow 
her into the drawing room. Sometimes the gentlemen remain in 
the dining room to enjoy cigars or cigarettes, the ladies going alone 
to the drawing room, but if a host has a smoking room all leave 
the table together, the gentlemen then following the host for a 
smoke in his own territory. 

In serving wanes, three different kinds are enough for the 
grandest occasions. Sherry or madeira with the soup or fish, 
champagne with the roast, claret or any red wine with the game. 
If one wishes wine with the dessert use port, burgundy or any fine 
wine. Very small glasses of liquors such as creme de menthe, apri- 
cot brandy or benedictine, are often served at the end of the din- 
ner after the coffee. If champagne alone is used, begin to serve it 
with the meat course. 

Unfermented grape juice is an excellent substitute for those 
whose conscientious scruples do not allow them to serve wine. No 
one need hesitate to give dinners without wine. Public sentiment 
has grown so strong on this question that it forbids criticism as to 
the propriety of omitting it. Dinners without wine are considered 
in as good or better taste, by many sensible people, than with it.

The Informal Dinner. 



"We'll have some half a dozen friends, 

And there an end." 

— Romeo and Juliet. 



The informal dinner is served much like the formal dinner, 
except there is more served at the table. The hostess often serves 
the soup from a soup tureen placed before her on the table. Fish 
or meat may be carved by the host. Vegetables need not be served 
dry, but if moist the dish containing them together with saucers 
may be placed upon a tray and passed to each guest to serve him- 
self. The hostess usually makes the salad at the table, but it is 
very attractive for the host to perform this duty provided he can 
make a good salad. The hostess serves the puddings and the host 
the pies, if they are served at the table. The informal dinner 
should really be en famille and should be served thus every day by 
the good housekeeper. Fewer people are invited at a time to the 
informal than to the formal dinner.

Luncheon. 

Luncheon is served like dinner and a formal luncheon varies 
but slightly from a formal dinner. Oysters are served cocktail 
style^, canapes are used also in place of oysters as at dinner. Soup 
Is often omitted and the meat course is not as heavy. Luncheons 
are usually for ladies only, and the fair sex is not supposed to en- 
joy the hearty food which the stern sex demands. The time of 
day also calls for lighter food than can be served at the dinner hour. 
If one has a handsome table, by all means let it be bare for luncheon, 
using doilies in place of a tablecloth. This gives the hostess a 
chance to display many treasures of her linen chest not otherwise 
seen. Doilies may be of costly lace, lace and linen, embroidered 
linen or hand crochetted lace. The latter is very fashionable and 
if one is handy with her hook, a most beautiful set can be made 
with very little expense. A set of doilies should consist of one 
dozen plate doilies about 13 inches in diameter, one dozen 8 inches 
in diameter for cup and saucer, one dozen 5 inches in diameter 
for tumblers, a center-piece to match, two or four doilies about 
15 inches in diameter to use under bon bon dishes and other dishes. 
If one has not a handsome table it is much better to use a fine 
damask cloth. Colored cloths with napkins to match are sometimes 
used at luncheons. Fruits are used more at luncheon than at din- 
ner. A salpicon of fruit or fruit soup is very nice for the first course 
instead of oysters or canape. Hot rolls are generally served with 
the meat or game course; they are buttered in the kitchen before 
sending to the table. Coffee is also served with this course. Great 
latitude is allowed as to the number of courses served at luncheon 
and a simple luncheon is quite as good, or better form, than a very 
elaborate meal. Many hostesses darken the dining room and use 
artificial light for luncheon parties, but this fashion is waning.

Breakfasts. 



"Dinner may be pleasant; 

So may social tea; 

But yet, methinks the breakfast 

Is best of all the three." 

— Anon. 



Breakfast parties make a plensant variety in the way of enter- 
taining. The hour for breakfast parties varies from 9 to 12 o'clock. 
In some cities they are given as. late as 2 in the afternoon. An 
early hour is preferable as otherwise guests are obliged to retain 
their strength by eating first at home and then a fine breakfast 
would not be enjoyed. Eight or 9 o'clock is perhaps the best hour. 
Macauley, the historian, was very fond of breakfast parties and 
in praising their merits said, "Dinner parties are mere formalities, 
but you invite a man to breakfast because you want to see him." 
Four courses are usually enough for breakfasts. Fruit or melons, 
fish, a light meat or game course with two vegetables and 
accessories and lastly a dessert of shortcake, waffles or something 
appropriate to the meal. At breakfast parties the silver service 
for tea and coffee remains on the table all the time, otherwise the 
breakfast is served like dinner. Soup and salad should not be 
served at a breakfast.

Gentlemen's Suppers. 

Gentlemen's suppers resemble ladies' luncheons in their ex-

enjoy more hearty and less dainty food while ladies enjoy more 
dainty and less hearty. Fish, meat and game are all generally 
included in gentlemen's parties.

Receptions, Teas and Card Parties. 

For receptions and card parties only light refreshments should 
be served, but for wedding receptions and ball suppers three courses 
are not too many. At a reception in a large house, coffee or choco- 
late with a salad and sandwiches are often served in the dining 
room, and ices and small cakes in another room from a small table. 
This is an excellent plan in any house where a large company is 
invited as it relieves the pressure in the dining room. 

Five o'clock Tea is the most simple and inexpensive form 
of entertainment and it is also one of the most attractive. People 
who are not wealthy can in this way repay their social obligations 
most charmingly. An afternoon tea is not a meal, simply a de- 
licious cup of tea with small thin bread and butter sandwiches 
with or without a filling, small cakes or cookies and if one wishes, a 
few confections. Sometimes a glass of sherbet is served. The 
serving may be done in the dining room or the tea table may be 
placed in the parlor where the hostess receives her guests seated 
at the table and brews a good cup of tea while she chats with them. 
The English generally serve toasted muffins and marmalade with 
tea. "At Homes" and "High Teas" are the same as "FiveO'clocks."

''May one give us peace in all our states — 
And the other a piece for all our plates." 



Have the table decorations in yellow, and carry out this color 
scheme as far as possible in the courses to be served. For center- 
piece take a large fine pumpkin that will stand flat on the bottom. 
Cut off the upper third, remove seeds and membrane. Stand a 
tall vase in the center of it and put yellow chrysanthemums in the 
vase, around it fill the pumpkin with fruit, oranges, apples and 
allow clusters of white grapes to fall over the edges. Place the 
pumpkin on a low silver tray and around it put 3 or 4 oranges 
with the skin cut part way down in quarters and turned back like 
rose leaves. Add also a few chrysanthemums with their own foli- 
age. This can be passed at the close of the meal for the fruit course.

TO OUR BELOVED 
PRESIDENT, 

MRS. CHANDLER STARR. 

Pre-eminently a natural leader and master of details, 

to whose keen instinct and constructive ability 

we are so greatly indebted, 

and whose genius and faith have constantly 

instilled in us the 

vital principal of success, 

this book is affectionately dedicated. 

Mendelssohn Club Committee. 



We know that things quite pretty 

are most pleasing to the eye; 
That sweet, harmonious music 

calms the soul's great eager cry; 
But we also know the longing 

that the stomach often feels, 
'Tis then you'll find quite charming 

what our useful book reveals. 

— Nan Lakin. 



THE PRELUDE. 

"In every work, regard the writer's end 
Since none can compass more than they intend, 
And if the means be just, the conduct true, 
Applause, in spite of trivial fault, is due." 

— Pope. 



There is still in existence a tradition, well grounded but not 
well founded, to the effect that the artistic temperament and the 
domestic sciences have but little in common; that they blend about 
as harmoniously as the proverbial oil and water. Just who is re- 
sponsible for its origin is not known, but undoubtedly it comes 
down to us from the dark ages, as one who had any light on the 
subject could never have been so blinded to the truth. However, 
truth and tradition often meet as strangers. 

That a musician may also be an accomplished cook, is demon- 
strated every day. And why not? Are not both accomphshments 
classified under that much abused name of Art? True, one may be 
"art for art's sake" and the other, art for the stomach's sake; but, 
nevertheless, both are found in the same category. And one famil- 
iar with art in any of its branches is already partially equipped to 
understand its many phases. For example, harmony is a basic 
principal in music, pursued with never ceasing vigilance, and what 
is more important in household economics than harmony, even in 
the culinary department? 

This argument is not intended as a vindication, for the posi- 
tion taken does not require that. It is merely for the enlighten- 
ment of any who hitherto may have sat in darkness. A word to 
the scoffer is sufficient. 



Richard Strauss, in his tone-poem, the "Domestic Symphony", 
has shown us that even the greatest of modern composers is thor- 
oughly conversant with the smallest details of housekeeping, and 
is able to reproduce all the musical sounds so dear to the house- 
wife's ear, from the crying of the baby to the fall of the favorite 
bric-a-brac. And how often is that great artist, Ernestine Schu- 
mann-Heink, whom we are proud to claim as an American citizen 
and who has so generously contributed to this little volume, quoted 
as an illustration of the model housewife and mother. 

Other examples might be quoted, ad infinitum, but it is un- 
necessary when we have constantly before us the Mendelssohn 
Club, among whose prominent members are culinary artists of ac- 
knowledged worth and unrivaled genius. Allow me to say here, 
for the benefit of the unitiated, that it is an erroneous idea to sup- 
pose that conversation at the club's "social sessions" is devoted 
to musical matters. On the contrary, that subject is usually ta- 
booed in favor of the latest discovery in domestic science, while 
those who have not yet assumed household cares listen in wide- 
eyed wonder to learned dissertations by the older and wiser mem- 
bers, on such vital topics as "In What Time Should an Egg be 
Beaten," "How Many Bars Should be Used of Laundry Soap," 
"In What Key Should the Tea-Kettle Sing to Denote the Boiling 
Point" and "What Should be the Composition of an Angel-food 
Cake to Make it a Perfect Symphony?" 

It was at one of these social sessions that the subject of pro- 
viding furnishings for the new Mendelssohn Hall was introduced 
for discussion. Funds were needed, and it was the wish of the club 
to provide the necessary amount without drawing upon the emer- 
gency fund. The suggestion came "Why not publish a cook-book?" 
Instantly two score voices echoed, "Cook-book," and the die was 
cast. The suggestion had struck a responsive chord. 

For months the active members of the club, individually and 
collectively, have worked to make this new venture a success and 
to sustain the reputation they hold in every field they have entered, 
of giving always the best. That home duties and the practical side 
of life have not been lost sight of nor neglected in the quest of the 
most beautiful of all the arts, is proven by the issuance of this 
little volume. From cover to cover, its pages will be found brim- 
ming over with invaluable information for the home-maker. 

With its customary broad-mindedness, the club has recog- 
nized the fact that there are other famous cooks, and many have 



generously responded to the invitation to contribute something 
from their choicest store. To those who have assisted in making 
the Mendelssohn Club Cook-Book one of the best ever issued, the 
club here expresses its grateful appreciation. 

With the publishing of this book, the club celebrates its silver 
anniversary. F^or a quarter of a century it has endeavored to stand 
for all that is highest and best in music, and year after year there 
has been a constant growth, always onward antl upward. With 
pardonable pride we place this work before the public, our first 
effort to prove that the pursuit of music is not all-absorbing, but 
all-embracing; that, as Goethe has expressed it, "Level roads run 
out from music to every side;" and that its possession fits one not 
only to adorn the concert stage and the drawing room, but to shine 
with added lustre in the home, as the light that never fails. 

— Ethel Van Wie.

BREAD. 



CHAPTER I. 

BREAD. 

It is truly said, bread is the staff of life. There is hardly any 
food which is so universally used, and since history first began it 
has, in some form or other, made one of the staples of diet among 
the peoples of the earth. While it is a far stretch from the leavened 
bread of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, or the crude corn bread 
of the Kafirs and American Indians, to the fancy products of the 
mammoth modern bakeries, the fact remains, that to-day bread 
still yields the greatest amount of nourishment for the least labor 
and cost, of any of the purely vegetable foods. The reason for the 
importance of bread is very simple. Ever since the far off days 
when the ancients first found the wild cereals, and our fore-fathers 
began to cultivate them, men have known that food prepared from 
them would support life and strength better than any other food. 
And although in our own land the ease with which we can get other 
food makes bread seem less important, it is as true to-day for the 
host to say, in asking the guest to partake of his fare, as it was for 
Him two thousand years ago, when He said, "Let me set a morsel 
of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayst have strength, 
when thou goest thy way." 

Hop Yeast. 
Put 1 cup hops in 3 quarts cold water. Boil 15 minutes, strain, 
set back on stove and add 5 large potatoes, peeled and grated, 3^ 
cup salt, same of sugar. Stir well, let boil up,. take off, cool and add 
a cup of yeast. Beat thoroughly and set by the stove until it is 
Ught. If preferred, the potatoes may be boiled in the hop water, 
and then mashed, adding salt, sugar, and yeast as above. 

Potato Yeast. 
Take 3 large potatoes, peel and cut up. Pour on 1 quart boil- 
ing water and cook )^ hour. Add }/^ cup sugar and same of salt, 
shortly before it is done. When sufl5ciently cool, put in any good 
yeast to raise it, and stir well together. The next day it will be as 
light as foam. A teacup of this yeast will be enough to raise 4 or 5 
loaves of bread. 



4 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Bread in a Mixer. 
Set sponge with 1 compressed yeast cake in 1 teacup warm 
water, with flour enough to make a thin batter. Let rise till light 
then add 1 quart warm milk, which has been scalded and cooled; 
% teacup melted lard, 1 even tablespoon salt, and 1 heaping table- 
spoon sugar, and 3 quarts flour. Stir in the mixer 10 minutes, then 
set to rise again. When light stir 5 minutes longer, then turn out 
on the board and mold into loaves, using as little flour as possible. 
Raise again about ^ hour and bake ^ to 1 hour. Set the sponge 
about 7 o'clock in the morning and the bread will be out of the 
oven by 12:30, or 1 o'clock the same day.

Whole Wheat Bread. 
Cook 1 medium size potato, mash well and add suflBcient warm 
water to make 1 quart, salt, 1 dry yeast cake dissolved in a little

lastly add yeast, cover and set in warm place. Add salt and knead 
well in the morning when it has raised; make into loaves, and grease 
each loaf with lard, which insures a tender, brown crust, and bake 
1 hour in a moderate oven. 

Salt-Rising Bread. 
Stir 1 heaping teaspoon cornmeal in 3^ cup scalding fresh milk 
at night. Put in bowl and set in a warm place. In the morning 
take 1 pint warm water, not scalding, a pinch of salt, and make a

that has stood over night, beat it well, set it in a kettle of warm 
water, and keep at an even temperature. It will be Hght in about 2 
hours. Then add 13^ pints warm water, 1 teaspoon salt and flour

pieces. Upon the bottom put a thick layer of strawberries or any 
perfectly ripe fruit, plentifully sprinkled with sugar, then lay on 
the upper layer of crust. Serve with cream. Peaches, raspberries, 
huckleberries and oranges may be substituted for strawberries. If 
preferred, make individual cakes by cutting dough with biscuit 
cutter or doughnut cutter. In latter case fill hole with whipped 
cream, and place fruit between and around. 

"Never Fail" Strawberry Short Cake. 
Hull 13^ boxes berries. Slice in two, add plenty of sugar and 
a little water. Stand at least 1 hour before using. Take 2 level 
cups flour; 2 heaping teaspoons baking powder; 2 teaspoons sugar; 
]/2 teaspoon salt; sift all together. Break 1 egg in cup, beat light 
with a fork, add 2 tablespoonsfuls of melted butter and fill up cup 
with milk. Stir this mixture lightly into flour. Divide dough into 
two parts, pat or roll into shape and bake in large layer cake tins. 
Bake a light brown. Invert one cake on plate, spread thickly 
with berries, add second cake to this also inverted and well but- 
tered. Spread with remainder of berries and serve immediately. 

— Mrs. Stanton Hyer. 

Lemon Short Cake 
Make a rich biscuit dough. While baking take 13^ cups of water, 
13^ cups sugar, and the peel, juice and pulp of 2 lemons, discarding 
tough part of rind. Boil this for a few minutes, then stir in 3 crackers 
rolled fine. Split the short cake while hot and spread with butter, 
then with the mixture. To be eaten warm. 

Timbale Cases. 

One cup flour; 1 cup milk; 2 eggs; 3^ teaspoon salt; 3^ tea- 
spoon sugar; 2 tablespoons olive oil or melted butter. Beat up eggs 
and add oil, then a little flour, a little milk, and so on. Also salt 
and sugar. Beat well and let stand for an hour in a cool place. 
Put timbale iron in kettle of hot fat for a few minutes. When hot, 
take out, wipe dry, dip in batter till it clings to iron, then put

CHAPTER II. 

SANDWICHES AND CANAPES. 

"Would you know how first he met her? 
She was cutting bread and butter." 

— Goethe. 

Sandwiches. 

The first thing in making sandwiches is to have a sharp knife. 
Bread should be one day old as it cuts better. Cream the butter 
and spread on the loaf before cutting. Cut as thin as possible. 
Remove crusts. Put the filling on to one slice and put the top slice 
over. Sandwiches can be kept fresh for hours by wrapping them 
in a damp napkin. 

Nut Sandwiches. 
Equal parts of grated cheese and chopped English walnuts, 
seasoned with salt and cayenne pepper. Spread between thin slices 
of buttered bread. 

Horseradish Sandwiches. 
Mix thoroughly 3^ cup each of grated horseradish and fresh 
butter, 3^ teaspoon each of salt and sugar, and add 2 tablespoons 
lemon juice. Spread upon circles of brown bread, placing them 
together in pairs. 

Cheese Butter Sandwiches. 
One-half cup butter; 6 tablespoons dry sharp flavored cheese; 
1 teaspoon made mustard; 1 teaspoon anchovy paste or sauce; 2 
teaspoons Worcestershire sauce. Beat the butter to a cream, add 
the cheese (grated), mustard, anchovy and Worcestershire sauces. 
Beat till well blended and spread between slices of buttered bread. 

Russian Sandwiches. 
Zephyrettes spread with thin slices of cheese. Cover with 
chopped olives mixed with mayonnaise. 

Sardine Sandwiches I. 

Remove bones from sardines, add chopped olives, a few drops 
of Worcestershire sauce and a few grains of Cayenne pepper. 



20 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Sardine Sandwiches II. 
Soak 1 small box of sardines in lemon juice 3^ hour. Drain 
and spread on^toast between fresh lettuce leaves, with a dash of 
paprika. 

Toast Sandwiches. 
Take yolk of 1 hard boiled egg; 1 tablespoon soft butter; 3^ 
teaspoon Worcestershire sauce; little salt and paprika. Chop the 
white of egg, mix all together and spread on fresh toast. 

Cream Cheese Sandwiches. 
One brick Blue Label cheese; 1 small bottle pimento olives; 
3^ cup chopped nuts.^ Thin with cream or salad dressing. Spread 
between thin slices of bread. 

Dutch Sandwiches. 

Cut rye bread into thin slices; place in each sandwich a thin 
slice of Switzer cheese, a layer of onion and minced ham, with 
salad dressing. 

Sweet Sandwiches. 

One-third each of preserved ginger, chopped dates and chopped 
nuts. Thin with ginger syrup. This is good between slices of 
brown bread or sunshine cake. 

Deviled Sandwiches. 

Mash yolks of 2 hard boiled eggs, }/i pound cheese. Chop the 
whites of eggs and 1 tablespoon capers fine, season with salt, pap- 
rika and mustard. Mix all together, moisten with salad dressing 
and spread between squares of graham bread. 

Fried Sandwiches with Ham. 
Butter slices of bread, spread between them chopped ham 
moistened with a little cream. Press 2 slices together firmly, dip 
in beaten egg and milk (3^ cup of milk to 1 egg), and fry in butter. 

Egg Sandwiches. 
Mix finely chopped whites of hard boiled eggs with the yolks 
which have been forced through a strainer or potato ricer. Season 
with salt and pepper and moisten with mayonnaise or other dress- 
ing, or with vinegar and a little mustard. 

Chicken for Sandwiches. 
Cold boiled chicken chopped fine and mixed with mayonnaise. 



SAI^DWICHES AND CANAPES. 21 

Mushroom Sandwiches. 
Mince beef tongue and boiled mushrooms together, add French 
mustard and spread between slices of buttered bread. 

Bacon and Egg Sandwiches. 

Fry 1 slice of bacon until crisp, and 1 egg until yolk is set. 
Cut bacon into small pieces and spread with the egg on toast be- 
tween lettuce. Add celery, cut in small pieces if desired. 

Peanut Sandwiches. 
Use either prepared peanut butter, or make the butter by run- 
ning peanuts through a meat grinder. Add pepper and salt and 
enough water to make a thick paste. Spread on thin slices of bread 
and butter and put a lettuce leaf between. 

Cheese Sandwiches. 

Yolk of 1 hard boiled egg; 34 pound grated cheese. Season 
with salt, pepper and mustard, and moisten with 1 tablespoon of 
vinegar. Exceptionally good with rye bread. 

Pimola Sandwiches. 

Butter thin slices of bread and put on bottom slice a lettuce 
leaf with cream dressing over it, on top of that put a layer of canned 
pimola (or sweet red pepper) with a little more dressing and then 
the top sHce, then trim the edges. This makes beautiful and de- 
licious sandwiches. 

Lettuce Sandwiches. 

Wash and dry fresh crisp lettuce leaves and put between 
slices of thin bread and butter and spread Mayonnaise dressing on 
the lettuce before putting together. 

Parsley Sandwiches. 
Chop parsley fine and season with salt and pepper and put a 
layer Vs inch thick between thin bread and butter slices. 

Ribbon Sandwiches. 

Slice Boston brown bread (or entire wheat bread) and white 
bread lengthwise of the loaf in % inch slices. Cream butter well 
and butter the slices thick with butter. Pile five slices on each 
other, alternating in color, three slices of white bread and two pf 
brown. Press together firmly and then cut them crosswise as in 
cutting a loaf of bread. These are pretty and good. 



22 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK. BOOK. 

Chive Sandwiches. 

Mix Neufchatel and cream cheese together and add chives cut 
up fine and put between thin shces of bread and butter. 

— Mrs. W. W. Sawyer. 

Canapes 

These dainty little appetizers are made with a single layer of 
bread and for this reason can be made much more decorative than 
sandwiches. They are served in place of oysters at a dinner or 
luncheon. At a gentlemen's dinner they are frequently served with 
a glass of sherry before entering the dining room. For cold canapes 
the bread is cut in thin slices and then cut out with a round cutter 
and covered with some highly seasoned mixture and decor- 
ated. For hot canapes, the bread, after it is cut in shape, is fried 
in deep fat or buttered and browned in the oven. 

Ham Canapes. 
Slice bread a quarter of an inch thick, then with a biscuit cut- 
ter about 3 inches in diameter, cut the bread into rounds. Butter 
the rounds, spread with some highly seasoned deviled ham and 
arrange on top in alternate circles, lines of chopped pickle and hard 
boiled egg minced fine. Serve on small plates with a sprig of curly 
parsley to give added color. 

Cheese Canapes. 

Cut quarter inch slices into rounds. Spread first with softened 
butter, then a thin layer of French mustard. Sprinkle very liber- 
ally with grated cheese and in the center of each place a seeded 
olive or a tiny mound of chopped pickles. If desired hot, spread 
the bread with a little French mustard, dip in melted butter and 
then sprinkle a thick layer of grated cheese, season with salt and 
cayenne pepper and place in the oven to soften the cheese. Serve 
at once. 

Sardine Canapes. 
Bone the sardines, then rub them to a paste, add a little oil 
from the can, mustard, lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Cut 
the bread into rounds and fry in butter until it is a delicate brown 
on both sides. Spread with the mixture and decorate with the 
whites and yolks of hard boiled eggs, each run through a ricer sep- 
arately. Cover the center of the canap6 with the whites, encircle 
the edge with a ring of the yellow and drop a bit of the yellow in 
the center of each. 



SANDWICHES AND CANAPES. 23 

Anchovy Canap€s. 

Cut }4: inch thick pieces of bread with a round cutter. Spread 
with a mayonnaise dressing. Boil eggs hard, when cold chop the 
whites fine and put the yolks through a potato ricer, and put an 
outside circle of the whites of the eggs on top of the dressing, fill 
the circle with the riced yolks and put a curled anchovy on top in 
the center, or use the straight anchovies split in two lengthwise, 
laid on to divide the canape in quarters. If the canape is desired 
hot, use the fried or toasted bread. 

Caviare Canapes. 

Canapes of caviare are much better served with cold bread than 
hot or toasted. Prepare the round slices of bread as for anchovy 
canapes. Spread with mayonnaise dressing and the riced hard 
boiled egg as before and put about 3^ of a teaspoon of caviare in 
the center on top. Caviare is the salted roe of the sturgeon. 

Tomato Canape. 

Cut bread in rounds as for other canapes, place one slice of ripe 
raw tomato (chilled) on each round. The bread rounds should 
be the same size as the tomato. Spread mayonnaise dressing on 
top of the tomato, put one curled anchovy in the center of each 
and surround it with an olive chopped up. This is the amount for 
each person. Place on small plates.

CHAPTER III. 

CEREALS. 

"We cultivate literature on a little oatmeal." 

— Sydney Smith. 

In purchasing any cereals small quantities should be obtained 
and kept in air-tight vessels. Cereals, to be healthful should be 
well cooked and in most every case it is safe to double the time of 
that given on the package. In cooking, use a double boiler and mix 
the finer preparations with a little cold water before adding to the 
boiling water. This will prevent the cereal from becoming lumpy. 
A teaspoon of salt should be allowed to each cupful of cereal. 

Table for Cooking. 

Prepared wheat, 1 cup; water, 13^ cups; time 30 minutes. 
Prepared oats, 1 cup; water, 1^^ cups; time 40 minutes. 
Rice (steamed), 1 cup; water, 3 cups; time 50 minutes. 
Indian meal, 1 cup; water, 33^ cups; time 3 hours. 
Scotch oatmeal, 1 cup; water, 4 cups; time, 4 hours. 
Hominy (coarse), 1 cup; water, 6 cups; time, 6 hours. 
Hominy (fine), 1 cup; water, 4 cups; time 3 hours. 
Wheat (cracked), 1 cup; water, 6 cups; time, 6 hours. 

Farina Fruit Mush. 

Fruit mushes served cold generally are appreciated for break- 
fast in place of the usual cereal. Blackberries, currants and rasp- 
berries are suitable as a foundation. Slowly heat the fruit until 
scalded, then press out the juice. Put into a double boiler; if cur- 
rants form the basis sweeten slightly; to each pint add one table- 
spoonful of farina and cook, stirring frequently, for ^ of an hour. 
Pour into one large or a number of individual molds and set aside. 

Corn Meal Mush. 
In cooking corn meal, either white or yellow, let water boil to 
bubbling point, then remove from fire, and sprinkle corn meal in 
very slowly, then put back on stove and cook about 10 or 15 min- 
utes, stirring constantly. 



CEREALS. 25 

Fried Corn Meal Mush. 

Cook the mush like above recipe. When it is done pack it in 
a bread pan to cool. When cold cut it in slices about half an inch 
and fry in a skillet in butter, or cut the pieces thicker and then cut 
in two and fry in deep fat. Cold hominy and cold oat meal mush 
can be fried in the same manner. 

Spaghetti k la Italienne. 

Fry 6 pork chops brown with 3 large sliced onions, adding 

butter or oil if needed. Pour over 2 cans of tomatoes, slice in 3 or 4 

whole roots of garlic which have been peeled, salt and paprika to 

season. Simmer slowly until the bones are bare and the sauce is 

dark and thick, adding a little boiling water from time to time if 

needed. It will take 7 hours or more, as it must cook slowly. Rub 

through a frying basket, pressing through as much of the pulp as 

possible. - Cook a large handful of unbroken imported spaghetti 

until tender in boiling salted water. Drain, rinse in boiling water, 

pour the sauce over and serve grated Parmensan or Swiss cheese 

separately. 

— Myrtle Reed McCullough. 

Genuine Italian Spaghetti. 

One package spaghetti, drop in boiling water and cook until 
tender; drain. Sauce — 1 quart can tomatoes, 1 can mushrooms, 
1 cup grated cheese, 2 onions, ^ pound bacon. Cut onions and 
bacon fine and fry till tender; add tomatoes, mushrooms, dash of 
paprika, a little Worcester sauce, 2 dessert spoons salt, and a little 
celery salt. Cook all this until thick, add to spaghetti. When 
ready to serve, stir in the cup of cheese. 

— Mrs. Frank Edmison. 

Spaghetti a la Ellery Band. 
Use 1 quart can tomatoes, strain contents through a sieve. 
To this liquid add 3 tablespoons olive oil, piece of butter size of egg, 
a teaspoon sugar, small bunch parsley, 3 small cloves of garlic, or 
onion if you prefer, salt and pepper to taste, and some sweet green 
pepper, chopped. Boil all this down over slow fire to thickness of 
cream. If possible, obtain imported Italian spaghetti; this is dis- 
tinctly superior to domestic. Boil spaghetti (2 pounds for above 
amount of sauce) in plenty of water in which you have put a gen- 
erous amount of salt. Above all things do not put spaghetti into 



26 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

water until it boils and do not cut it up into little snippy pieces, as 
that is un-Italian and utterly inadmissable. Last but not least, 
do not cook your spaghetti to a pasty mass, but remove it, and 
drain through a colander when it is just right. Pour sauce over 
and serve on large platter. Grated cheese, Parmesan preferred, 
should be served separately for those who desire it. 

— Channing Ellery. 



Macaroni and Cheese. 
Break half a package of macaroni in small pieces. Cook briskly 
in boiling salted water for 20 minutes, drain and rinse. Butter a 
shallow dish, put in layer macaroni, sprinkle with salt, dot with 
pieces of butter, and over it a layer of cheese, grated. Repeat this 
until macaroni is all used, leaving a sprinkling of cheese with butter 
in small pieces on top. Beat 1 egg, add 3^ pint milk, salt and pepper, 
pour over all and bake, covered, 3^ hour. Remove cover and brown. 

How to Boil Rice. 

Rinse 1 cup rice in two waters. Put over fire 2 quarts water 
in large kettle, add to this 1 even teaspoon salt, sprinkle rice slowly 
in water, cover tightly, and let cook 20 minutes. Water must be 
boiling before rice is put in, let cook rapidly without stirring. Re- 
move from fire, put rice in colander to drain, then set in oven for 
few minutes until it steams itself dry. Every kernel should be 
separate. 

— L. D. W. 

Spanish Rice — Tribune Prize Receipt. 

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in frying pan; when hot, add 1 cup 
dry rice; fry until brown, stirring continually; add 1 pint water, 1 
small onion, chopped fine, salt and pepper and 3^ quart can toma- 
toes. Cook 30 minutes, covered. 

Rice Molds. 

One quart of milk and water equal parts, half teaspoon of salt,^ 
1 cup of sugar; bring to boiling point; 1 cup of ground rice, moisten 
well to prevent clodding, stir in fluid, boil 15 minutes, pour in cus- 
tard cups or any small, pretty form. When ice cold turn out. 
Serve with cranberry sauce or any other tart sauce. 



CEREALS. 27 

Rice Milanaise. 

Chop fine a good-sized onion and fry in butter until a golden 
color, then add a cupful of rice and half a dozen minced mush- 
rooms. Stir for 2 minutes, add a quart of boiling broth. Stir 
lightly once. Cook for 25 minutes. Season with 1 teaspoonful of 
salt, 3€ of a teaspoonful of pepper and 3^ a cup of grated Swiss 
cheese. 

Rice and Peaches Served with Meat Course. 

Wash thoroughly 3^ cup rice; sprinkle in boiling salted water; 
cook 20 minutes or until tender. Take 1 can large California peaches 
cook in their own syrup, adding sherry wine to taste, putting in 
about a handful of Sultana raisins. Cook until peaches and raisins 
are tender. Pile rice on chop platter, arrange peaches around rice 
on edge of platter, place raisins in hollow of peaches, pour rich 
syrup around peaches.

COFFEE, TEA, CHOCOLATE AND COCOA. 31 



CHAPTER IV. 

COFFEE, TEA, CHOCOLATE 
AND COCOA. 

Coffee 

"May your coffee and slanders against you be ever the same 
— without grounds." 

The best grades of coffee are the Mocha and Java, bought 
either in the grain to be roasted and ground as needed in the home, 
or purchased in small quantities freshly roasted and ground. Most 
people prefer a mixture of the two, using one-third of Mocha and 
two-thirds of Java. Always keep in a closely covered tin or earthen 
jar to retain the full strength of the berry. When properly roasted, 
coffee should grind into small but distinct, hard and gritty par- 
ticles, instead of into a fine powder. There are various ways of 
making coffee and many different coffee pots on the market, but 
there a few general rules that it is wise to keep in mind. Always 
buy the best grades of coffee and be sure that the pot is as tight as 
possible to prevent the escape of the aroma. Of course the coffee 
should not have to stand long after being made. To make one 
quart of coffee take one cupful of coffee, one-third of a raw egg, 
to clear it, half a cupful of cold water and one quart of boiling 
water. Stir coffee, egg and cold water together before adding boil- 
ing water or the heat from the latter will cook the egg. One cup- 
ful of coffee calls for a tablespoon of coffee, the same of cold water 
and one teaspoonful of egg with a cupful of boiling water added 
last. Do not use too much egg in the making of coffee as it weakens 
it. Egg shells may be saved and used for clearing, the albumen, 
which clings to the shell, performing the office. About three 
crushed egg-shells are sufficient for clearing purposes when one 
cup of ground coffee is used. By using egg the coffee has a richer 
flavor which egg alone can give, but when strict economy is neces- 
sary the egg may be omitted if great care is taken in the making 
and handling, as very much motion causes it to become muddy. 
Do not use a tin coffee-pot as the tannic acid in coffee acts on such 
metal and is apt to form a poisonous compound. Always see that 



32 THE MENDKLSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

the pot is scrupulously clean after its use, as well as scalded before 
using. Coffee is a powerful stimulant for some people, but it is 
generally conceded that when used without the "trimmings," 
cream and sugar, it is much more healthful and less likely to cause 
ill effect. Sugar used without cream is less harmful than cream 
used alone in coffee. There seems to be an element in coffee which 
combined with cream forms a leathery coating on the stomach 
and impairs digestion. 

How to Make Coffee. 

One cup coffee; 1 cup cold water; 1 egg; 6 cups of boiling water; 
pinch of salt. Use granite ware coffee pot. Wash egg, break and 
beat it slightly. Pour in one-half the cold water, add crushed shell, 
and stir in with coffee. Turn this into the coffee pot, pour on boil- 
ing water, and mix thoroughly. Boil 3 minutes on front of range; 
if not boiled, coffee is cloudy, and if boiled too long, too much tannic 
acid develops. To prevent escape of fragrant aroma, stuff spout 
with soft paper. Stir and pour some in a cup to free the spout of 
grounds, then return to coffee pot and repeat. To perfect clear- 
ing add the remaining cold water. Cold water being heavier than 
hot water sinks to the bottom, carrying the grounds with it. Place 
on back of range for 10 minutes, where coffee will not boil. Serve 
at once. 

After Dinner Coffee. 

Use twice the quantity of coffee, or half the amount of liquid 
given in previous recipe, for after dinner coffee. When milk or 
cream is not used, filtered coffee is often preferred. Black coffee 
should not be served with milk or cream. Serve in after dinner 
coffee cups, with or without cut sugar. 

Percolated or Filtered Coffee. 

One cup coffee (finely ground); 6 cups boiling water. There 
are various kinds of coffee-pots on the market for making perco- 
lated coffee. All have a strainer to hold coffee without allowing 
grounds to mix with the infusion. There are some which have ad- 
ditional vessels to hold boiling water and upon which the coffee-pot 
may be rested. Place coffee in strainer, strainer in coffee-pot, and 
pot on the range. Gradually add boiling water, allowing it to filter, 
and cover between additions of water. Refilter, if desired stronger, 
and serve at once with cream and cut sugar. Place cream and 
sugar in cup before hot coffee. Scalded milk, or part milk and part 
cream may be used, if cream is obtainable, when a diluted cup of 
coffee is desired. 



COFFEE, TEA, CHOCOLATE AND COCOA. 33 

Australian Coffee Cup. 
One pint of very strong black coffee, flavored with Y^ tea- 
spoon of bitter almond. Cook in a double boiler with the yolks of 
2 eggs, well beaten; 2 tablespoons of sugar, and 2 tablespoons of 
thick cream. When thick as custard remove from fire and chill. 
When ready to serve, pour into a pitcher with a pint of whipped 
cream, sweetened, shaved ice and a quart bottle of Appolonaris or 

other charged water. 

— Anna B. Walton. 

'Tolly, put the kettle on. We'll all take tea." 

Tea 

"May beauty and truth 

Keep you in youth; 
Green tea and sage 

Preserve your old age." 

Black and green tea are produced from the same plant, but 
by different methods. They contain about the same quantity of 
caffeine or theine, and tannin, but differ in the amount of volatile 
oil. Tea should not be taken during the meal, but after it, if one 
wishes to avoid the retarding effect that it has on salivary diges- 
tion. The better plan is to eat first and drink afterward. Black 
tea is not so strong as green or mixed teas. The latter is respon- 
sible for most of the cases of nervousness among tea drinkers. If 
tea is made by pouring boiling water on the leaves and served in a 
few minutes, but little tannin is present in the beverage; but when 
it is steeped a long time and drunk freely the tannin present in 
the decoction is harmful. Tea is less likely to cause sleeplessness 
if lemon juice is used instead of cream. Both tea and coffee are 
less harmful if taken clear. Cream and sugar, especially cream, in 
these beverages, do a certain amount of damage to the stomach. 

How to Make Tea. 

Three teaspoons tea; 2 cups boiling water; always scald thor- 
oughly the tea-pot before using. After putting in tea pour on boil- 
ing water and allow it to stand on the back of range or in some 
other warm place for 5 minutes. Then strain and serve immedi- 
ately, with or without sugar and milk. Avoid a second steeping of 
the leaves as, if this is done, so large an amount of tannin is ex- 
tracted that various ills are apt to follow. 



34 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Iced Tea. 

Four teaspoons tea; 2 cups boiling water. Follow recipe for 
making tea, strain into glasses which are y^ full of cracked ice. 
Sweeten to taste, and allow 1 slice lemon to each glass of tea. By 
chiUing the infusion quickly, the flavor is much better. 

Russian Tea. 

Follow recipe for making tea. Russian tea may be served 
either hot or cold, but always without milk. A thin slice of lemon 
or a few drops of lemon juice is allowed for each cup. Add sugar 
according to the taste. In Russia a preserved strawberry is some- 
times added. 

Wellesley Tea. 

This tea is made the same as iced tea. Before straining place 
3 crushed mint leaves in glasses 

Herb Teas. 

For the dried herbs use 1 teaspoonful to a cup of boiling water. 
Cover and stand where they will not boil, for 5 or 10 minutes. Strain 
before serving. Too long steeping makes them bitter or acrid with- 
out increasing their medicinal value. 

Chocolate and Cocoa 

These contain in good proportion all the elements necessary 
to nourish the body. Cocoa is the seed of the fruit of a small tropi- 
cal tree, and there are several forms in which it is sold, the most 
nutritious and convenient being chocolate. Next in order comes 
cocoa, cocoa nibs and last cocoa shells. The ground bean is called 
cocoa. Ground finer and mixed with sugar it becomes chocolate. 
The broken beans are called "nibs" and the shells are the parts of 
the bean that are removed before grinding. These shells make a 
delicate drink, but contain little nourishment. Pure chocolate is 
easily assimilated and digested as food by those able to take fat, 
as about 50 per cent, of chocolate consists of fat. In cocoa the ex- 
cess of fat is removed. Vanilla is the best flavor to add to choco- 
late. Cinnamon also is good. Neither chocolate or cocoa should 
be boiled too long or the flavor is impaired. 

Breakfast Cocoa 
One and one-half tablespoons prepared cocoa; 2 tablespoons 
sugar; 2 cups boiling water; 2 cups milk; pinch of salt. Scald milk, 
then mix together cocoa and sugar and dilute with }4 cup of boil- 
ing water to make a smooth paste, add remaining water, and boil 
1 minute. Turn into scalded milk and beat for 2 minutes.

SOUPS. 

"Soup is to the dinner what the door is to the house." 

Introduction. 

Exactness in cooking removes the danger of failure. Recipes 
should be exactly copied. The skeleton of soups must be accurate, 
but more seasoning or more thickening may be added to suit the 
individual taste. 

Soups should be brought to the boiling point and then pushed 
back on the stove to simmer, as boiled soups are greasy and muddy. 
Seasonings are important. Winter vegetables, such as turnips, car- 
rots, celery and onions should be kept on hand for soup; also sweet 
herbs, including thyme, savory, marjoram, bay leaves, peppercorns, 
cloves, allspice berries, stick cinnamon, dry tarragon leaves, brown- 
ing, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, with additions of salt, pepper 
and parsley are essentials for soup stocks. Flour, cornstarch, arrow- 
root, fine tapioca, sago, pearl barley, rice, bread or eggs are added 
to give consistency and nourishment to the soups. 

Vegetables and seasonings should be added the last hour. 

In getting meat from the market, have bone and meat cut into 
small pieces. When ready to start soup, put meat and bone in soup 
kettle, cover well with cold water. Let stand 1 hour to draw out 
juices; heat gradually to boiling point; set on back of stove and let 
simmer 6 to 7 hours. This will form stock for many kinds of soup. 

To clear soup stock: Add white of an egg or washed egg shells 
(2 or 3) to cold strained stock and bring to a boil slowly. Then re- 
move from fire and strain through flannel cloth. 

Brown Soup Stock. 

Six pounds shin of beef; 3 quarts cold water; 3^ teaspoon 
peppercorns; 6 cloves; 3^ bay leaf; 3 sprigs thyme; 1 sprig marjoram; 
2 sprigs parsley; 3^ cup each carrot, turnip, onion and celery; cut 
in dice. Wipe beef and cut lean meat in inch cubes. Brown }4 
meat in hot frying pan in marrow from marrow bone. Put the rest 



SOUPS. 37 

of the meat fat in soup kettle, add water and let it stand 30 minutes. 
Put on back of range, add browned meat and heat slowly to the 
boiling point. As scum rises it should be removed. Cover and cook 
slowly 6 hours, not boiling. Add vegetables and seasoning; cook 
1^ hours. Strain and cool as quickly as possible. 

— Mrs. Charles Reitsch. 

White Soup Stock. 
Three pounds knuckle of veal; 1 pound lean beef; 3 quarts 
boiling water; 1 onion; 6 slices carrot; 1 large stalk celery; 3^ tea- 
spoon peppercorns; 3^ bay leaf; 2 sprigs thyme; 6 cloves. Wipe 
veal, remove bone and cut in small pieces; cut beef in small pieces; 
put bone and meat in kettle and cover with cold water and bring 
quickly to boiling point, drain and throw away the water. Wash 
thoroughly bones and meat in cold water; return to kettle; add 
vegetables, seasoning and 3 quarts boiling water. Boil 3 or 4 hours.

Bouquet to color. Soak meat in cold water 1 hour; then heat to

vegetables and seasonings the last hour. Strain and cool. Remove 
fat when cooled. 

Hot bouillon is also served with grated Parmesan cheese. 

Iced bouillon flavored with sherry wine is served cold.

parsley and cabbage leaves. Brown in butter 2 potatoes sliced, 
add to the soup with carrots and cauHflower. Cook slowly for 2 or 
23^ hours. Strain through a fine sieve, and add noodles, rice or

of soda, in a vessel that will hold not less than a quart. In another 
vessel put a quart of milk to heat, and in a granite pan that sets on

cold milk. Or, beat well yolks of 2 eggs, pour on them slowly 
about 3^ a cup of the hot soup, stirring rapidly; then add to the re- 
maining soup and serve immediately. This makes a nourishing 
and cheap luncheon soup.

when the scraps are a good brown take them out and put in a large 
bowl of chopped onions to fry. They should be fried in a frying 
pan and the chowder kettle be made clean before they are put in it.

cately that they will be missing in the chowder.) Add a quart of 
hot water to the onions, put in the clams, clam water, and pork 
scraps. After it boils add a large bowl of potatoes cut into eighths

FISH. 53 



CHAPTER VI. 

FISH AND METHOD OF COOKING. 

FISH. 

Fish a la Perfection. 

From a Man's Point of View. 

Take a guide, go miles from anywhere, catch bass or trout, 
have it prepared wath salt-pork or bacon, have it served on a gen- 
erous slice of bread, accompany it with a cup of fine coffee, top 
off with a good cigar, and then feel like thanking the stars that 
you are alive. 

— Harrison M. Wild. 

Fish should be butchered while alive, slit about 1 inch from 
the tail, up, hung in the shade about ^ of an hour to bleed. Pre- 
pared in this way will always retain its flavor. Fish are good 
when the gills are red, eyes are full, and the body firm and stiff. 

Table for Cooking Fish. 

Trout should always be boiled or baked. White fish is good 
boiled, but best broiled. Black bass, when large, boiled; when 
small, broiled. Red-snapper should always be boiled. Muscalonge, 
baked or boiled. Fresh mackerel should be broiled. Perch, Smelts, 
Brook Trout, Ciscoes, Bull-heads and Herrings are all better fried. 

To Boil Fish. 

Place in cold, salt water before cooking, to make it firm. When 
ready to cook place in cloth bag or wrap in cloth tied tightly, put 
in cold water and boil. Always put salt in the water before cooking. 

To Fry Fish. 

Clean, wash and dry thoroughly. Dip in yolk of egg well beaten ; 
then in fine grated bread crumbs, flour or meal. If wished to look 
extra nice, repeat the egg and bread crumbs. Fry in boiling lard, 
a light brown, and serve hot free from grease. Fish fried in Olive 
oil adds greatly to the flavor. 



54 THK MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

To Broil Fish. 

Wash and wipe the fish dry, and spht. Lay on the broiler 
with the skin up. When browned, turn. Have some butter, with 
pepper and salt in it, and mop it over the fish while broiling. It 
will take about 20 minutes to cook one of medium size. Serve on 
hot dish, and pour over it drawn butter. 

Creole Stuffing for Baked Fish. 
Five pounds trout, white fish or shad; 3^ green sweet pepper; 
3^ cucumber; 1 bunch of parsley; 3 large or 3^ can tomatoes; 1 
slice salt pork. Grind all together in meat grinder, drain off liquor, 
add a little onion juice, 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, add cracker 
crumbs till stifif. 

— Mrs. Gussie Miner, The Thadwa. 

Anchovy Sauce. 

One tablespoon butter; 2 tablespoons flour; rubbed together; 
moisten with 1 pint boiling water; add 3^ tablespoon Anchovy 
sauce, 2 teaspoonfuls catsup, a little Worcestershire sauce, little 
salt and pepper, 1 teaspoonful walnut catsup. 

— Mrs. Gussie Miner, The Thadwa. 

Fish Sauce. 

One-half pint cream; 1 medium sized cucumber, chopped and 
squeezed dry in cloth. To the cream add salt and vinegar to taste, 
(3 or 4 tablespoonfuls), add dry cucumber and serve very cold. 

— Mrs. Webb C. Stevens. 

Tartare Sauce. 

To be served on white fish, trout, smelts, halibut or fresh cod. 
One quart Mayonnaise: Yolks of 3]eggs, beaten; 1 pint oil; 14, cup 
vinegar; 3^ cup whipped cream; stir 10 minutes. 

Chop up 6 sour pickles, 3 tablespoonfuls of capers, 2 bunches 
parsley, 1 Sharlot onion, chop very fine; add 3^ teaspoonful 
paprika, 3^ teaspoonful celery salt, little salt and pepper, then 
add to Mayonnaise. 

— Mrs. Gussie Miner, The Thadwa. 

Fish Chowder. 
Slice 10 medium potatoes and 5 white^onions ; season with salt 
and pepper, and boil 2 minutes covered with water. Boil 3 fish 
(more or less), 20 minutes. Remove from liquor and bone and skin 



FISH. 55 

fish. Add liquor to potatoes and onions. Dice Y2 pound of salt 
pork and fry until brown. Put these pieces with chowder. Thicken 
salt pork drippings with 3 tablespoonfuls of flour, add this thicken- 
ing to chowder and boil 20 minutes. Five minutes before taking 
off from the stove add fish and 2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

— Mrs. F. G. Shoudy. 

Stewed Perch — Old Country Style. 
Scale and clean 10 pounds of perch; sprinkle bottom of kettle 
with flour, salt and pepper and bits of butter. Lay in fish, whole — 
repeat flour, butter, salt and pepper, then fish until all is in. Pour 
in w^ater to cover, about 1 quart. Add bay leaf, 6 pepper kernels. 
Boil slowly 45 minutes, take fish out on platter, add juice of 1 
lemon to gravy, strain and pour over fish. 

— Mrs. Gussie Miner, The Thadwa. 

Fried Shad. 

After the shad is cleaned and washed, split it down the back, 
cut out the back bone, divide the fish into pieces about 3 or 4 in- 
ches square, and lay them on a clean dry cloth. Have in readiness 
a dripping pan or a large frying pan containing hot fat ^ inch deep, 
roll the fish in flour seasoned with salt and pepper, put it into the 
fat while smoking hot and fry it brown on both sides; use a broad 
spatula or cake turner to turn over the pieces in order to preserve 
them entire. As quickly as the pieces brown lift them out of the 
pan, .lay them on brown paper for a minute to free them from fat 
and then turn them onto a hot dish. Serve with lemons, pickles 
or cucumbers. 

Shad Roe. 

Put the roes in a pan and cover with cold water, and parboil; 
be careful not to break them. When done take from the water and 
cool, then season with salt and pepper; dust with flour and dip 
into beaten egg; roll in bread crumbs or cracker dust; brown in 
boiling lard and serve hot. May be served on edge of platter with 
shad. 

Fish Balls. 

Two pounds pickerel, trout or codfish; scrape from skin and 
chop fine; add 1 onion chopped and mashed; work in 3^ pound of 
melted butter till white; V^ pound of flour; 2 well beaten eggs; then 
add 3^ pint sweet milk or cream, a little at a time. Add salt and 
pepper to suit taste; drop by spoonfuls in boiling water and cook 
till done. The lightness of fish balls depends on the amount of 
stirring.

SHELL FISH. 

Oysters. 
Oysters furnish a delicious change in the daily menu. They 
can be served in an endless number of ways that will tempt the 
most delicate appetite. Raw oysters should be opened on the deep 
shell and served in it on a bed of cracked ice, with the half of a 
lemon and some stimulating condiment. Oyster cocktail is a popu- 
lar appetizer and it may be served in hock glasses .or in lemon 
shells. If in the lemon shells, remove the pulp and fill the shells 



60 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

with small oysters and pour over them a sauce made of 1 teaspoon- 
ful of grated horseradish, 2 teaspoonfuls of catsup, a dash of 
Worcestershire sauce and a pinch of salt. An oyster cocktail is 
also acceptably served in the center of a small grape fruit from 
which the core has been removed. 

Oyster Cocktail for 5 Persons. 

One tablespoonful Worcestershire; 1 tablespoonful Targon 
vinegar; 1 tablespoonful catsup, Snyder's; 1 tablespoonful lemon 
juice; 1 teaspoonful horseradish; 3^ teaspoonful tobasco sauce; 
salt to taste. Serve cracked ice and 1 tablespoonful in each dish 
of oysters. 

— Mrs. Arthur Fisher. 

Oyster Stew. 
To 1 quart of solid oysters use 1 pint of water; when hot, 
skim. Put in a kettle with butter, salt and pepper. Boil 3 minutes, 
add 1 quart of new milk which has been previously heated. Bring 
all to nearly boiling point and serve immediately. 

Panned Oysters. 

Drain the oysters from the liquor; put them in hot pan or 
spider as soon as they begin to curl; add butter, pepper and salt. 
Serve on toast or without if preferred. 

Fried Oysters. 

Only very fresh oysters should be used — beware of those with 
a green streak down the back. 1 loaf of dry bakers bread (very 
much better than cracker crumbs); grate this on a grater, dry the 
oysters, roll in flour, salt and pepper. Dip in batter made of 1 egg 
and 1 tablespoonful of milk, then roll in bread crumbs; repeat 3 
times, fry in deep fat. Have the fat smoking hot, fry 1 minute. 

— Mrs. Gussie Miner, The Thadwa. 

Escalloped Oysters. 

Put layer of cracker crumbs (not too fine) in bottom of but- 
tered bake dish, then layer of oysters, little lumps of butter; re- 
peat this until dish is filled. Save the liquor, add milk, salt and 
pepper and moisten well. Bake in a hot oven with cover on, till 
the last half hour; remove cover and brown nicely. 

— Mrs. T. V. Engstrom. 



FISH. 61 

Oyster Omelet. 

Beat separately the whites and yolks of 5 eggs. Soak 1 cup 

of fine bread crumbs in 1 cup of milk with a little salt, add 1 cup 

chopped oysters drained and seasoned; lastly the stiffly beaten 

whites. Fry in buttered pan. — Mrs. W. S. Miller. 

Oyster Patties. 
Make a rich cream dressing, then add oysters; cook until 
edges curl up, about 3 minutes. Then serve in patties made of 
rich puff paste. 

Lobsters. 

Lobsters should always be cooked alive, never dead, for a 
dead lobster is poison. The only poison or unhealthy part of a 
live lobster is the dark vein running through the head. This is 
removed after the lobster is cooked before it is eaten. Baked lob- 
sters are as good as broiled lobsters and are much more easily pre- 
pared. Live lobsters should always be kept in sea water and should 
never be kept very long before cooking. 

— Mrs. Chandler Starr. 

Baked Live Lobsters. 

Split a live lobster and put in a roasting pan in a' very hot 
oven; cook about 15 minutes. The liver (or tomalley) cooked with 
1 tablespoonful of butter about 3 or 5 minutes and seasoned with 
salt, Cayenne pepper and Worcestershire sauce makes a dressing 
for the baked lobster. — Mrs. Chandler Starr. 

Boiled Live Lobster. 

Take a chicken lobster (or baby lobster as it is also called); 
put alive in a kettle of boiling sea water or fresh water salted. Put 
a cover and weight on top of kettle and boil for 20 minutes or un- 
til it has turned from green to a beautiful scarlet. Crack the shells 
in kitchen and serve hot on platter. The meat is delicate and de- 
licious. Take out of shells at table and eat with a little butter, 
salt and pepper. — Mrs. D. F. Scott. 

Creamed Lobster. 

One pint of lobster meat (chopped or picked up). 1 cup white 
sauce seasoned with celery, parsley and a little Cayenne pepper. 
Mix with the lobster and put in a baking dish, covering the top 
with cracker crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven. 

— Mrs. D. F. Scott. 



62 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Lobster a la Newberg. 

Meat of a boiled lobster or 1 can of lobster; good sized lumps 
of butter; 1 gill of Sherry; 1 pint cream; yolks of 2 eggs. Glass of 
Sarentine (may be omitted). Put lobster into a pan or chafing 
dish with butter, stir gently until thoroughly heated. Mix Sherry, 
cream and yolks of eggs, first eggs and cream. Pour over lobster 
and let simmer, then add Sarentine, if used. Pour over toasted 
bread. Sherry may also be omitted. 

— Mrs. T, V. Engstrom. 

Lobster Cutlets. 

Put 2 tablespoonfuls of butter in a dish over a fire; when 
melted add 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, rub together until smooth, 
then add 1 cup of sweet cream, salt; when thickened add 3^ pound 
of lobsters, diced. Turn out on well buttered platter and cool, 
then cut in the form of cutlets, dip in egg, then in cracker crumbs, 
and fry in deep fat. 

— Mrs. Edwin M. St. John. 

Shrimps. 

Shrimps are served on the Pacific Coast, boiled and served in 
their shells, which are easily opened. After removing from shell 
the little dark streak should be pulled out. They are also delicious 
in salad combined with equal parts of celery and Mayonnaise 
poured over them. 

Buttered Shrimps. 

Shell some shrimps and place in a frying pan with a lump of 
butter, a small quantity of salt and pepper and stir over fire until 
hot. Fry thin slices of bread in butter, drain, when a golden brown, 
place them on a hot dish, pile buttered shrimps on bread and serve. 

Creamed Shrimps. 

Prepare the shrimps, taking them from the shells or the can 
and let stand in cold water for 3^ hour; make a rich cream dressing, 
break the shrimps in little dice and add to the cream sauce. Put 
this in Ramikens, with bread crumbs on top and brown i n the 
oven nicely. 

— Mrs. Fannie Moffatt. 



FISH. 63 

Steamed Clams. 
Clams for steaming should always be alive and in the shell. 
Wash the shells thoroughly and put in steamer over a kettle of 
boiling water; steam about 20 minutes. Serve in large soup plates, 
in shells. The true way to eat, is to take the shell up in the fingers, 
open it and take out the clam and dip in a saucer of melted butter 
and eat. It is a dish fit for the Gods. Only novices attempt to eat 
steamed clams with a knife and fork. 

— Mrs. Daisy Force Scott. 

Stewed Soft Clams. 

Thoroughly wash about 33^ dozen fresh soft clams so that no 
sand remains in them after they are opened; lay them carefully on 
the palm of the left hand and with the right hand remove the body 
with care, but nothing more, being cautious not to break it, and 
throwing away all the other part. When all are prepared, place 
them in a stew pan with 1 ounce of butter, small pinch of white 
pepper, 1 wine glass of Maderia wine and 2 finely hashed medium 
sized truffles; place the cover on pan and cook gently for 7 or 8 min- 
utes. Break the yolks of 3 eggs into a bowl, add 1 pint of sweet 
cream and beat well for 3 minutes. Pour this over the clams and 
toss the sauce pan for about 3 minutes more very gently to thor- 
oughly mix the clams with the cream, but not letting the liquor boil 
again. Neither a fork or spoon should ever be used in mixing them. 
Serve in hot dish at once. 

Clam Fritters. 
Place some fresh clams into one pan, and the liquor from them 
into another. Prepare a mixture of broken crackers and flour in 
equal quantities and dip the clams first into their own liquor and 
then into this, repeating this operation 3 times, finally dipping 
them into milk, and then again into the flour mixture. Have pre- 
pared some boiling lard, drop in a few clams at a time, let them 
fry for about 5 minutes; then remove them with a skimmer, place 
them on a strainer, drain away the fat, and they are ready to be 
served. The pan containing the lard should be so deep that the 
clams will be covered when put in. 

Crabs. 
Crabs are in season from April to September. The richest 
flavored crabs are those of medium size, say from 6 to 10 inches 
in their broadest diameter. They should be boiled alive, being 



64 THF MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK ROOK. 

plunged into cold water and as the water warms a handful or so of 
salt should be thrown in. Boil 20 minutes or 3^ hour, according 
to size. Some authorities claim that if they are put in hot water 
first they are apt to throw off their claws by a violent jerk and then 
the water would soak into the flesh and make it sloppy. The scum 
should be carefully skimmed off after the salt is put in. They 
should be firm and stiff and the eyes bright. The male crab has 
the largest claws, therefore is much more preferable. 

Broiled Soft-Shell Crabs. 

Dip some soft shell crabs into melted butter and season with 
pepper and salt. Broil them until the shells are slightly brown. 
As soon as done, serve them hot, with melted butter or lemon juice 
or with a lemon cut into quarters. Slices of hot toast should be 
laid under them. 

Stone Crabs. 

Should be served cold as they are considered dangerous to eat 
hot. Plunge in boiling hot water, cook 30 minutes. Break shells

CHAPTER VII. 



MEATS. 



Beef. 

Tastes dififer as to the choice cuts and butchers cut differently. 
From the hind-quarter of beef are cut the rump for boihng or roast- 
ing, the round, the rump, the sirloin and the porter-house steaks. 
From the hip bone to the ribs are cut the porter-house steaks. The 
larger porter-house steaks, containing larger portions of the tender- 
loin, are near the hip bone. The smaller porter-house steaks, con- 
taining almost no tenderloin, sometimes called club-house steaks, 
are near the ribs. 

The tenderloin, which is the choicest piece, when removed 
whole, is called the fillet and may be used for roasting or broiling. 
It lies under the short ribs and close to the back-bone and is usually 
cut through with the porter-house and .sirloin steaks. Of these 
the porter-house is usually preferred. The small porter-house 
steaks are the most economical,- but in the larger steaks the coarse 
and tough parts may be used for soups, or, after boiling, for hash, 
which is really a very nice dish when well made. 

A round steak is sweet and juicy when the leg is not cut down 
too far, the objection being its toughness, to cancel which it may 
be chopped fine, seasoned and made into croquettes. There is no 
waste in it, hence it is the most economical to buy. The interior 
portion is the tenderest and best. Round steak, if well pounded 
to make it tender, has the best flavor. -The best beef for k la mode 
is also the round. Have the bone removed and trim off all the 
gristle. 

The choicest portions of beef for roasting are the ribs, the five 
first of which are the "prime ribs." This cut is the finest and best 
flavored piece of the beef for roasting, excepting possibly the sir- 
loin, which is rarely used as a roast in this country. 

The sirloin as a roast is second to none, but for carving it needs 
an experienced hand; the loss through trimming and cooking is 
more than one-third its weight. Another piece of beef sometimes 
used for roasting is the rump or short hip of beef. It is more suit- 



70 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

able for braising or for steaks. It is not, however, considered as 
juicy as are the other portions of the beef. 

The best cuts for pot-roasts are the rump, round arm piece 
and the chuck roast. 

For those who wish lean corn-beef which will slice nicely, the 
rump is best. If some fat is desired with the lean, select a fancy 
brisket or plate piece. 

Mutton. 

For roasting mutton choose the leg or loin. The loin is the 
sweeter, but very wasteful. The leg of mutton is more economical 
for boiling or roasting and slices beautifully. For stews use either 
the breast or shoulder. The breast is sweeter, but the shoulder has 
more lean meat in proportion. The loin mutton chop is considered 
to be more tender, but the rib chop is sweeter. With the meat 
trimmed from the end of the rib and prepared for the paper holder, 
it is called the French Chop. The loin chop, with the bone removed 
and fastened in a circular form by a skewer, is known as the Eng- 
lish Chop. 

In selecting beef or mutton, choose that which has plenty of 
white, fine-grained fat. 

Spring Lamb. 

The hind-quarter of spring lamb is more easily carved than 
the front-quarter and is also more expensive. The front-quarter 
is considered to be much sweeter and can be boned before cooking. 

The crown roast of lamb is probably the most attractive 
form in which a lamb roast can be served. It is taken from the 
fore-quarter of the lamb. The meat is formed in a circle with the 
ends of the ribs "Frenched," the whole representing a crown. 

Veal. 

Veal is best from calves not less than four nor more than six 
weeks old. The meat should be clear and firm and the fat white. 
If dark and thin, with tissues hanging loosely about the bone, it 
is not good. 

The choicest roast of veal is the loin with the kidney left in. 
For broiling or frying, the rib or loin chops are the sweetest and 
tenderest, but many prefer the cutlets from the leg or round. 

The knuckle of veal is the part left after the fillets and cutlets 
are removed and is best for soup or boiling. The shoulder and neck 
are also nice for stews or soup. The breast of veal is good for roast- 
ing, stewing and pies. It can be boned, then rolled, or a large hole 
may be cut in it for stuffing. 



MEATS. 71 

Pork. 

The loin or rib is the best part for roasting. The lean meat 
must be fine-grained, and the fat and lean very white. The shoulder 
is cheaper than the loin and is not as wasteful. The ham is nice 
for roasting if from small, young pork. The rib pork chops are the 
sweeter, but the loin chops are the more economical. 

The tenderloin is cut from the inside of the loin and may be 
used as a roast or for broiling. 

Ham. 

The best hams, whether fresh, or cured and smoked, are those 
from 8 to 15 pounds in weight, having a thin skin, solid fat and a 
small, short, tapering leg or shank. 

Tongues. 
Beef, calf, lamb, sheep and pig's tongues are used. Calf's 
tongue is considered the best, although lamb's tongue is very nice. 
Choose those which are thick, firm and have plenty of fat on the 
under side. In buying salt tongue, select one with a smooth skin, 
which denotes that it is young and tender. 

Sweet Breads. 

Sweetbreads, if properly cooked, make one of the most de- 
licious dishes that can be served. There are two kinds, one found 
in the throat of the calf (when fresh it is plump, white and fat, of 
an elongated form) ; the other, the heart sweetbread, which is finer 
than the throat sweetbread, is attached to the last rib and lies 
near the heart. The form is rather round and it is firm and 
smooth. The color should be clear and a shade darker than the fat. 

In roasting meats allow from 15 to 20 minutes to the pound, 
according to the thickness of the roast. The oven should be too 
hot to hold the hand in for only a moment when the meat is first 
put into it. This crisps the surface and sears the pores of the roast, 
thereby preventing the escape of the juices. The choicest roast 
can be absolutely ruined by a cool oven. After preparing the 
roast for the oven and placing in dripping pan do not put water in 
the pan, as it prevents the desired crispness and destroys the fla- 
vor of a roast. Baste it thoroughly before placing in the oven 
with butter or suet fat, afterwards basting frequently with its own 
drippings, which always makes it more tender. If it is necessary 
to add water, do not put it in pan until the meat has been in the 



72 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

oven about half an hour, or until it begins to brown, and then 
only a very little of hot water and butter. 

All meats should be seasoned when partly cooked, as the salt 
toughens the meat and draws out the juices. 

Mutton, lamb, veal and pork should be cooked more slowly 
and thoroughly than beef, with a moderate fire. 

In roasting veal, some cooks put in half a cup of boiling water 
and butter when placing it in oven. 

Fresh meat for boiling or stewing should be put into boiling 
water and closely covered, as it thus retains its flavor. Boil slowly 
about 20 minutes to each pound, salting when it begins to get tender. 

Salt meats should be covered with cold water and require 
about 30 minutes to the pound of very slow, steady boiling. Al- 
ways pour off the first water and add another of boiling water. 

Boiling meats should simmer continually and be replenished 
with boiling water until thoroughly cooked. 

In broiling steaks or chops have a very hot fire or pan. Turn 
often in order to keep the juices in. It also increases its tenderness. 
Never pierce the lean part of any meat with a fork, as that allows 
the juices to escape.

And some wad eat that want it 
But we hae meat and we can eat, 
Sae let the Lord be thankit."

BEEF. 
Prime Roast Beef. 

The first seven ribs are best. Have the chime removed, and 
ribs sawed about an inch long. Lay in a dry roast pan; sprinkle 
plentifully with salt and pepper, and place in hot oven, allowing 
15 minutes to the pound. Do not add water, nor turn the roast 
over. When done, remove the roast and drain the grease from

spoon flour in water, and add while boiling, for gravy. 

— Mrs. Thompson.

ing. Garnish with parsley, latticed potatoes and little string beans. 
The steak must be served on the plank, which can rest on a large

POULTRY AND GAME. 95 



CHAPTER VIII. 



POULTRY AND GAME, 



''The cackling of geese saved the city of Rome; 
May all these recipes keep peace in the home." 

By the word game is meant all animals and birds which have 
never been domesticated and are proper to be eaten — from the 
little quail, prairie chicken and other birds to the roe, deer and 
other hoof-footed species. The flesh of wild animals has an aroma 
more marked than that of the tame ones. 

How to Choose Poultry. 

The age of the poultry is the principal thing. The best chick- 
ens are plump on the breast, fat on the neck, with smooth yellow 
legs, tender skin and the lower part of the breast bone pliable. A 
young turkey is known by its short spurs, dark and smooth legs. 
The age of the young duck may be ascertained by tearing the skin 
between the toes, if the skin tears, the duck is young. Geese may 
be know by taking the windpipe between two fingers and pressing 
it, and if young, a low crackling sound will be heard; also, if the 
thumb will easily press through the skin under the wing, the goose 
is young. 

Full grown fowls have the best flavor, providing they are 
young. Older poultry makes the best soup. Chickens with yellow 
skin and feet make the richest stews. All poultry and game should 
hang at least 24 hours in a cool place after they are killed, before 
cooking. Flesh of game is tough when first killed, it is more tender 
if kept sometime, or if frozen. 

How to Kill Poultry. 
Chickens and turkeys are killed either by chopping off the 
head or cutting the artery on the neck. After poultry is killed, hang 
it up by the feet and as soon as the bleeding stops pick off the feath- 
ers, while yet warm, and then singe. Geese and ducks are killed by 
taking the fowl under the left arm, holding the bill in the left hand, 
then stabbing it on top of the head; hold the fowl in this position 



96 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

letting the blood run into a dish. When the blood stops running 
hold a red hot iron on the place where it is stabbed; this is done to 
prevent any blood from dropping on the feathers; then pick the 
feathers and singe the fowl. 

Feathers from geese, ducks, prairie hens, pigeons and birds of 
all kinds are always picked off dry — chickens only should be scalded. 

Drawing Poultry. 

Cut off the feet at the first joint, then the head and half the 
neck; cut the skin on the back of the neck down to the back of the 
wing. Detach the skin from the neck and draw the skin down over 
the breast, then cut off the rest of the neck close to the body, re- 
move the crop and windpipe, break the ligaments that hold the 
internal organs to the breastbone, then cut an opening below the 
breastbone down to the vent. Put the hand in the opening and 
carefully work it around until the top of the breastbone is reached, 
and draw out all the organs at once. Close to the ribs will be found 
a pinky substance called the lungs, or lights, remove these. 
Cut out the vent and the oil bag on the tail, then wash the fowl 
quickly inside and out with cold water. Cut the gizzard open, re- 
move the thick inside skin and carefully remove the gall bag from 
the liver. 

In shipping fowls frequently the intestines have not been re- 
moved and if such is the case, in washing the fowl, add a half tea- 
spoonful of baking soda, which will sweeten and render all the more 
wholesome. 

The giblets are the gizzard, heart, liver and neck. 

In roasting or boiling any fowl, truss it, which means, to draw 
the thighs close to the body across the legs at the tail and tie firmly 
to the body with twine which is removed before serving, or pass 
the legs through a slit near the tail and skewer the wings close to 
the body. 

Carving. 

"Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods, 
Not hew him as a carcass fit for the hounds." 

— Shakespeare. 

A few simple rules are to be observed in carving birds. Plunge 
the fork upright into the very center of the breastbone and. keep 
it there until the bird is dissected and served. Remove the legs 
first between the thigh and body until the bone is reached, then 
the thigh is forced back and the joint laid open, then remove the 



POULTRY AND GAME. 97 

leg with the point of the knife. Remove the wmgs taking a part 
of the breast with it, the breast then can be sliced. 

Pigeons, quails and other birds of the same size are split 
lengthwise into halves. 

CHICKEN. 

Giblet Broth. 

Pour boiling water over the chicken feet, take them out and 
remove the skin and nails and place them with the giblets. Cover 
with cold water, add teaspoonful of salt, 1 small onion and boil until 
tender. This broth can be used for basting any roasted or fried fowl. 

Chicken, Roasted Plain.

the lower corners coming to within an inch of bottom of kettle. 
Cover bottom of kettle with thin layer of minced pork, then a layer 
of chicken (uncooked), pepper, salt, bits of butter, 2 egg yolks 
crumbled fine, a thin sprinkle of flour. Take dough which was left 
and after cutting a piece large enough for top crust, use the re- 
mainder for dumplings, rolling as thin as possible. Cut into strips 
about 3 inches wide, then across in pieces about 2 inches wide. 
Cover the layer of chicken with some of these. Put on another thin 
layer of pork and proceed as at first, until all is in kettle. Roll out

100 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

a quarter of a pound of fat pork very thin and fry it with the 
chicken until it is brown. After the chicken and pork are fried 
take them up and stir into the pan in which they were cooked a 
tablespoon of flour. Stir it over the fire until brown; then add a 
pint of the chicken broth, a teaspoon of salt, 34 teaspoon of pepper. 
Stir this gravy until it has boiled 2 minutes and use it for pie. To 
make the crust: Mix together in a bowl with a knife 1 pound of 
flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, 2 teaspoons of butter, and just enough cold 
water to hold it together. Roll it out about an inch thick; cut a 
quarter of a pound of butter in large slices, and lay it all over the 
paste; fold it up and wrap in a floured towel and put in the ice box 
for half an hour. Roll it out, repeating same with another quarter 
of a pound of butter; roll it to a thickness of 3^ inch, fold it in 3 
thicknesses and roll it out again. If the butter breaks through, 
fold it again in a towel and cool for half an hour before using. Line 
a deep dish; then put in alternate layers of chicken, pork, and 
sliced raw potatoes; pour in as much gravy as the dish will hold. 
Sprinkle with a little chopped parsley, a dash more of pepper and 
salt, and cover with a top crust, wetting the edges to make them 
adhere. Cut a hole in the top to allow the steam to escape.

Chicken Fillet — How to Prepare for Entries. 

Remove the skin from the breast of a young plump chicken so 
that the fillet will lay bare; make an incision on top of the breast 
bone from end to end, then with a small knife cut off the entire 
breast from each side, including the small wing bone. Under each 
breast will be found a small fillet which is called the mignon; care- 
fully remove it, pare off the thin white skin which covers the fillets 
and the mignon, then lay them in a buttered pan and cover with 
buttered paper and set in cool place until wanted. 

Chicken Fillet h. la Toulouse.

slices of buttered toast and pour over the toast; serve hot. 



Boiled Chicken with Oyster Sauce. 

Select a plump, fat year-old-chicken weighing about 5 or 6 
pounds; remove carefully all the fat possible; a fat fowl is the most 
tender, but if the fat is cooked in it, the flesh will have a strong 
taste. Prepare a dressing by using a pint of stale soft bread crumbs, 
taken from the inside of a loaf of bread, salt to taste, a pinch of 
cayenne, a pint of small oysters, a large teaspoon of butter and 1 
egg. Mix this well and dress the fowl. Rub a thick cloth with 
butter, then dredge it with flour "and sew the fowl up in the cloth

Chicken Croquettes I. 

One chicken weighing 3 pounds; 1 pair sweetbreads; 2 onions 
sliced and fried in butter until brown; 3^ teacup sweet thick cream; 
3^ teacup broth; i^ salt spoon of mace; little red pepper to taste. 
Cook and chop chicken fine; add sweetbreads and onions chopped. 
Mix all ingredients; place in a sauce pan over the fire until it comes 
.to a boil. Take 1 teaspoon of flour, moisten with chicken broth, stir 
into the boihng mixture. After a few moments remove from the 
fire and set to cool. When cold, add 1 well beaten egg; then take 
out on bread board in a large oval spoon a croquette portion, roll 
in cracker dust, drop into boiling lard, take out, and drain on a 
piece of linen. Place on hot platter and garnish with parsley. 

— May Irwin. 



Chicken Croquettes II. 

One large chicken; 2 sets calves brains, boiled; 1 small cup 
suet, chopped fine; 2 sprigs parsley, chopped; 1 nutmeg, grated; 
1 tablespoon onion after it is chopped very fine; 1 lemon; the juice 
and grated rind; 1 teaspoon salt; paprika and red pepper to 
taste. Cut up and cook the chicken thoroughly; when done, take 
out of the kettle, skin and put through a meat grinder while hot. 
Put the stock away to cool. Add brains and other ingredients; 
skim the greese off the jellied stock and add; also add a little cream 
until the mixture is very soft. Set away for a while, then mould 
into croquettes, dip into beaten egg and roll in bread or 
cracker crumbs and fry in hot lard in a wire basket. This 
will make about 25 croquettes. Some people prefer rice in- 
stead of the brains. When rice is used, take 1}4 cups boiled rice 
and mix with the chicken while still very hot. 

The secret of good croquettes is to have them very soft and 
fluffy on the inside, made so by stock and cream. Mix them as 
moist as it is possible to handle them and let stand awhile after 
they are dipped in egg and rolled in cracker crumbs. 

— Mrs. Chandler Starr. 

Creamed Chicken. 

Melt }4 cup of butter; stir into it half a cup of flour, half a tea-

TURKEY. 

Turkey Roasted, Plain. 
Pluck the bird carefully and singe; break the leg bone close 
to the body; hang up the bird and draw out the tendons from the 
legs (all good butchers will do this if asked). Make a small slit 
down the back of the neck and take out crop, then cut the neck 
bone close. After the bird is stuffed the skin can be turned over 
the back and the crop will look full and round. Cut around the 
vent, making the opening as small as possible, and draw carefully. 
Boil the giblets for the gravy. Wash the turkey, dry, salt thor- 
oughly inside and out and fill with dressing. Sew up the opening 
at the vent, tie the legs and wings, rub the turkey well on the out- 
side with butter and place in the oven until it is nicely browned; 
then remove and cover the back and sides with a paste made from 
flour and water; return to covered pan, breast side down; add 
about a cup of hot water; cover and bake slowly until tender. 

Chestnut Dressing. 

Peel a good sized challot, put in a sauce pan with 1 tablespoon 

of butter and heat without browning. Add 3^ pound of sausage 

meat, cook little longer, then add 10 finely chopped mushrooms, 

12 well pounded, cooked, peeled chestnuts and mix well together; 



106 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. ' 

then season with salt, pepper and a Httle thyme and parsley. Let 
this come to a boil, then add 3^ ounce fresh bread crumbs, 24 whole 
cooked and shelled French chestnuts and mix well together, be- 
ing careful not to break the chestnuts. Let cool and stuff the 
turkey. 

Sage Dressing. 

Soak a loaf of stale bread, without the crust, 10 minutes in 
cold water; then press out all the water through a cloth. Cook, 
without browning, 8 tablespoons chopped onion, in 1 tablespoon of 
butter; add this to the bread, then add 8 tablespoons of sausage 
meat, half tablespoon salt, half teaspoon pepper, teaspoon of sage 
and 2 whole eggs. Mix all well together and use as directed in 
former recipe. 

Creole Dressing for Turkey. 

Save the blood from the turkey. Cook giblets in as little 
water as possible until tender and then chop fine. Cook 3 cups 
rice in 6 cups salted water. Cut fine, small bunch tender green 
onion tops and parsley. Chop fine 2 large onions and fry (not 
brown) in 5 or more tablespoons melted fat. To this add the cooked 
rice, giblets and water in which they were boiled, onion tops and 
parsley, then the blood. Stir until the blood is thoroughly mixed. 
Season highly with red and black pepper, salt and a pinch of sage; 
cook until blood has changed color, stirring mixture all the time. 
Stuff turkey with this as you would bread dressing. 3 or 4 dozen 
oysters added the last thing before stuffing turkey is very nice. 

— Mrs. Montou, Jennings, La. 

Roast Turkey with Sausage. 

Stuff the turkey with rich dressing. When done, turn out on 
a platter, surround it with small fried sausages and chestnuts 
cooked in broth, and serve with a well thickened giblet sauce. 

Braised Turkey. 

Truss and stuff as for roasting, using a forcemeat made of 
mushrooms and sweetbreads in addition to the bread. Lard the 
breast with salt pork, place the turkey in a stew pan, breast upper- 
most, with sliced vegetables, and water to cover. Set it on the top 
of the stove and as soon as it begins to boil put it in the oven and 
bake slowly until done. 



POULTRY AND GAME. 107 

Boiled Turkey with Oyster Sauce. 

Prepare in the same manner as for roasting; fill with the oyster 
dressing (for oyster dressing recipe see "Boiled Chicken with Oyster 
Dressing"), tie legs and wings close to the body, place in boiling 
water that has been well salted, breast down. Skim often, let it 
boil until done, being careful to avoid skin being broken. Serve 
with celery or oyster sauce. 

Boned Turkey. 

Very difficult, but very nice. Clean the fowl as usual; have a 
very sharp pointed knife; begin at the end of the wing, pass the knife 
down close to the bone, cut all the flesh from the bone, leaving the 
skin whole. Pass the knife down each side of the breast bone, and 
up the legs' keeping close to the bone. Split the back half way up 
and carefully draw out the bones. Fill these places with the stuff- 
ing, restoring the fowl to its natural form; then sew up all the incis- 
ions made in the skin. Lay a few strips of salt pork on the top, 
and roast, basting often with salt and water and a little butter. 
Add a glass of port wine to the gravy. When serving, carve across 
the fowl in slices.

taste spicy). Pick the meat off the bones, skim all fat off liquor 
and pour over meat and set aside in cool place to jelly. 

In selecting ducks for roasting remember 2 small young ones 
are better than a large drake. If buying a farm-yard duck, shut 
them up 2 or 3 days and feed on barley meal and water to cleanse 
them thoroughly. 

A recipe suitable for goose is equally as good for duck. 

Pigeons and Capon. 
A recipe that is suitable for chicken is equally as good for 
pigeons and capons. 

Pigeon en Casserole with Asparagus. 

Truss 4 or 5 pigeons, cleaned as for roasting. Saute in butter 
and put in casserole and cover closely. Cook an onion and 2 young 
carrots, sliced thin, in 2 tablespoons butter; add 1^ cups boiling 
water and Y^ teaspoon salt, pour over the pigeons, cover and cook 
until pigeons are tender. Strain off broth, thicken with butter and 
flour and when boiled add yolks of 2 eggs, well beaten, and 34 cup 
cream, mixed together. Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice, salt and 
paprika to taste, and 1 bunch cooked asparagus; pour over pigeons.

Swedish Fried Chicken or Squab. 

Cut the chicken in pieces; brown each piece quickly 

in butter in an iron kettle (an iron kettle is necessary to use with 

this recipe). When all the pieces are browned place back in kettle, 

season to taste with salt and pepper; add 1 teacup hot water; cover 

with tight fitting lid. Allow the chicken to simmer slowly until 

tender, adding small quantity of hot water from time to time as 

may be required. For the gravy add flour slowly, stirring with a 

Swedish straw wisp, then add 1 cup cream and sufficient hot water 

to give proper consistency. 

— Anna Nelson Reck. 

Baked Squab. 
Have 6 squab. Use 3^ cup stock, 4 tablespoons butter and 
salt and pepper to taste. Clean and truss the birds, rub the breast 
with a piece of onion and put a piece of butter into each squab. 
Put into a baking pan and add the stock, salt and pepper and bake 
in a quick oven 45 minutes, basting frequently. When the birds 
go to the oven, put the livers and hearts on to boil. Bake and 
place the squabs on buttered toast, and into pan put 1 tablespoon 
butter and brown; add 1 tablespoon flour and the livers and hearts 
mashed fine. Mix all well together with 3^ pint stock, stirring con- 
stantly until it boils. Add salt and pepper and pour over squab. 

Mrs. George D. Roper. 

GAME. 

Wild ducks have a strong, fishy flavor. In order to remove this 
flavor, the ducks should be picked, singed and drawn and thor- 
oughly washed inside and outside in cold water. Cover them with 
boiling water to which has been added 1 tablespoon soda, 1 carrot 
and 2 onions. Boil 3^ hour; take ducks out and put in cold water; 
then wipe dry, season and stuff with any preferred dressing. Rub 
breasts with butter and place salt pork over them and bake in 
moderate oven until brown. Baste often with water that has a 
little onion in it and melted butter. 

Fillets of Teal Ducks k la Pontchatrain. 

Lift the breasts of fine plump birds, leaving skin on and score 
lightly. Marinate these in olive oil, in which has been incorporated 
cut chives or young onion tops, parsley leaves, salt beignonette 
and lemon juice. Let them remain for 2 hours and when ready to 



110 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

serve, pour a little oil in a sautair; make hot and put in the fillets. 
Brown nicely, but keep rare; remove and introduce enough "Espag- 
nos" into sautair for number of fillets. Remove from fire, add 
orange juice and strain. Arrange fillets in circle alternately with 
croutons of equal size and shape. Garnish to suit; pour sauce in 
center and serve. 

H. H. Havens, Steward, The Nelson. 

Wild goose may be prepared in the same way. 

Pheasants may be baked same as chicken. 

Prairie Chicken. 

After cleaning and drying thoroughly, stuff with any desired 
dressing and truss. Put in dish and steam until tender, then dredge 
with flour and rub butter over breasts and place in oven to brown, 
basting often with Hquor in steamer, or with water. Serve with 
apple sauce or currant jelly. — Mrs. Thomas Weldon. 

Prairie chickens, if young, are also good fried Hke spring 
chicken. 

The skull of a young prairie chicken can be crushed by the 
pressure of the thumb. 

GROUSE. 

Season and truss a well cleaned and dried grouse; bake as any 
other fowl, basting often. When ready to serve, untruss the bird, 
dress then in bread croutons and garnish with water cress. Add 
bouillon to the gravy, skim off the fat and pour over the bird. 

Smothered Birds. 
All small game birds are apt to be dry when fried or roasted, 
but if they are well seasoned and buttered, then smothered in rice 
they will be more juicy. Line a baking dish (individual dishes are 
nice) with boiled rice. Put in birds and cover with rice, press 
smoothly and pour over it water and butter, and bake until tender. 
If birds are old parboil them, using that hquor to moisten rice. 

Roast Partridge, Filled with Truffle Dressing. 
Pick, singe and draw 2 fine partridges; wipe out the inside; 
chop fine the 2 Hvers and 3^ pound pork tenderloins, pound to a 
paste; add 6 fine cut truflSes, season with salt and pepper; fry quar- 
ter of a pound of salt pork, add the other ingredients, stir for a few 
minutes over the fire; then fill the crop and body of the 2 partridges 
with this forcemeat, sew up and truss them nicely; lay the birds 



POULTRY AND GAME. Ill 

in a pan, spread 2 tablespoons of butter over their breast and bake 
in a hot oven, basting frequently until done; then untruss remove 
the threads, lay the birds on two bread canapes. Add to the gravy 
1 tablespoon fine cut onions and carrots, and bay leaf, 12 whole 
peppers; cook 5 minutes; add 1 tablespoon flour, stir well; add 1 
pint broth and 1 teaspoon beef extract; boil; and if necessary, some 
salt; strain, and serve with the bird. 

QUAIL. 

Steamed and Creamed Quail. 
Place quail well salted in a dish and set in steamer; steam until 
tender. Use the liquor and rich milk to make a sauce, season to 
taste. Put quail on squares of toast and pour sauce over. 

Quails with Juniper Berries. 
Remove heads and feet from 6 fat quails, draw and wipe neatly. 
Crush a heaping tablespoon of sound, well dried juniper berries and 
place in a bowl with half a teaspoon of fresh butter; thoroughly 
mix, then take half of the mixture and divide equally among the 
6 quails, putting it inside of them. Truss, season with salt and 
pepper and set on a roasting tin with a thin slice of salt pork over 
each bird; set in the oven for 25 minutes, basting frequently; then 
discard the pork and untruss the birds. Set them in a cocotte dish 
over the fire and when thoroughly hot divide the rest of the butter 
into 6 parts, put it over the birds and send at once to the table in 
the cocotte. 

Quail k la Maitre d' Hdtel. 

Split 6 quails through the back. Season with salt and pepper; 
brush each one with olive oil or butter. Broil for about 20 minutes, 
turning at least 4 times. In the meantime cream 4 tablespoons 
butter; add slowly 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon chop- 
ped parsley, half teaspoon nutmeg. Put the birds on well buttered 
toast and spread the Maitre d' Hotel butter over the birds and serve. 

Reed birds, woodcock and snipe can be prepared by any of 
the foregoing recipes. 

VENISON. 

The loin, haunch, leg or saddle may be roasted. A leg of veni- 
son may be boiled until tender and then browned on all sides. The 
meat from neck and shoulder is stewed. The best steaks are cut 
from the loin and should be broiled.

Roasted Ribs of Venison. 

Trim off all the fat from the ribs and cut them into lengths to 
fit roasting pan; lay them closely together on edge, cover with but- 
ter and season, and bake slowly. 

Saddle of Venison with Currant Jelly. 

Remove the skin from the surface and trim it neatly; lay strips 
of salt pork over it; season with 1 tablespoon salt and tie it into a 
round shape; lay the meat in a roasting pan; add 1 sliced onion and 
a small carrot, cut into small slices; pour over 4 tablespoons melted 
butter; place the pan in a hot oven and roast 1 hour, basting fre- 
quently with its own gravy; add a little water if the gravy should 
get too brown. Add to the gravy in the pan 3 tablespoons sherry 
wine and the same of broth; let it come to a boil, then strain; re- 
move all the fat, pour the gravy over the meat and serve with the 
following sauce: Melt 1 tablespoon butter in sauce pan; add 1 tea- 
spoon flour; cook and stir 2 minutes; add 3^ cup boiling water, 
}/2 teaspoon beef extract, 34 teaspoon salt; cook and stir 2 min- 
utes; then add 1 gill port wine and 1 cup of currant jelly; cook a 
few minutes and serve. 

Booyah. 

Use the flanks or neck pieces for this recipe. Cut the meat 
into cubes 1 inch square. Dice 3^ pound salt pork and fry, add 
meat and brown. Have twice the quantity of diced carrots, onions 
and potatoes as meat. About an hour before the meat is tender, 
add the vegetables. If the gravy is not thick enough, add a little 
flour and water and season with salt and pepper. 

In preparing venison remove all the fat possible for it is very 
strong. 

HARES, RABBITS AND SQUIRRELS.

CHAPTER IX. 

VEGETABLES. 

"Nor lacked our table small parade of garden fruits." 

Summer Vegetables. 

Certain vegetables should always be boiled uncovered to pre- 
serve their color. This applies especially to string beans, green 
peas, spinach, sorrel and Brussels sprouts. If the water is very 
hard a teaspoonful of soda added to a gallon will be found a good 
proportion. 

Another i^iportant rule is to remove the vegetable from the 
fire and drain it the moment it is sufficiently cooked. Do not draw 
it aside and let it stand in the water or it will be quite spoiled. 

Too much stress cannot be laid on the rule to remove from 
the fire and drain all vegetables thoroughly the moment they are 
cooked perfectly tender. Not only allow the water to run off, but 
press it out when possible, or place the colander on something 
over the fire that the water may be driven off by the heat. Or use 
any other device suggesting itself rather than let the vegetables 
remain wet and soggy. No amount of seasoning will give them 
the proper taste if they retain the water from the boiling. 

To avoid the unpleasant odor caused by cooking cabbage use 
a very large pot and do not fill too near the brim with the water, 
as it is the boiling over which causes the worst odor. Another way 
of overcoming the odor is to put into the water a piece of bread 
tied in a fine white rag. After it has been 15 minutes in the pot 
remove it and throw it immediately into the fire to burn, as in its 
turn it becomes very unpleasant. Still another method is to put 
a piece of charcoal in the water with the cabbage. 

In using milk for mashed potatoes, use it hot instead of cold. 
The result is better. Not everyone knows all vegetables that grow 
under the ground should be cooked in cold water.

Cream Sauce for Vegetables. 

One tablespoonful of flour, 1 very large tablespoonful of but- 
ter, 3^ pint of new milk brought to boiling point, 3^ teaspoonful 
of salt; pepper as desired. Put three-quarters of the butter in a 
sauce pan over the fire. As soon as it melts add the flour and stir 
until blended. Be careful not to let it brown. Add the boiling 
milk by degrees to the flour and butter, stirring without ceasing. 
Boil 3 minutes. Remove from the fire; add salt, white pepper and 
the rest of the butter; stir until the butter melts and serve immedi- 
ately. If it has to be kept, set it over a kettle of boiUng water; 
stir every now and then to keep a scum from forming on the top. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes. 

One small onion, minced; 1 heaping teaspoon minced parsley; 
butter the size of an egg. Cook the butter, onion and parsley to- 
gether about 5 minutes, then add about 2 cups cold boiled diced 
potatoes; heat thoroughly through and add salt and pepper to taste. 



116 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Saratoga Potatoes. 

Slice very thin; put them in cold water for 2 hours, keeping 
cold; take out and dry them in towels; fry in deep fat until a light 
brown; drain off grease in colander and sprinkle salt over them. 

French Fried Potatoes. 

Pare and cut into strips lengthwise rather small potatoes; 
soak them in cold water; dry in towels and fry in deep fat. Drain 
and sprinkle salt on them. 

Escalloped Potatoes. 
Pare and cut potatoes in slices about a quarter inch thick. 
Butter a baking dish and put in a layer of potatoes, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper and dredge flour over them and put on little pieces 
of butter. Repeat this till the dish is ^ full and pour milk over 
nearly to the top of the potatoes. Bake about 13^ hours. 

Creamed Potatoes. 

One pint milk; 1 tablespoon flour; 2 tablespoons butter; 1 tea- 
spoon salt; 1 quart diced, cold boiled, or baked potatoes; 1 table- 
spoon chopped parsley. Melt butter in double boiler; add flour, 
milk, parsley, salt and a little pepper; heat through, then add the 
potatoes and cook 3 or 4 minutes. Cold baked potatoes have a 
better flavor than boiled for cream potatoes. 

Hashed Brown Potatoes. 

One-half pint of cold boiled potatoes, chopped fine; 3 table- 
spoons cream; 3^ teaspoon salt and a little pepper; mix them to- 
gether. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet and then put in 
the potatoes and smooth them over. Cook slowly till a light brown, 
then fold one half over on the other and serve on a hot platter and 
garnish with parsley. 

Larded Potatoes. 
Pare and with apple corer punch hole through potato length- 
wise; roll a thin piece of bacon and put in hole, and bake about 
35 or 40 minutes. 

Potato on the Half shell. 
Bake 4 potatoes with smooth skins; when done, cut length- 
wise, and scoop out potato, being careful not to break the skin. 
Mash, season, adding milk and the beaten whites of 2 eggs; fill 
shell, heaping lightly on top. Brown slowly; serve immediately.

Old Potatoes. 

Old potatoes, peeled and left lying in cold ^svater for several 
hours, then wiped, rubbed all over in melted butter, and baked, 
are more mealy and delicious than the high priced new potato in 
the spring time of year. — C. C. C, Detroit, Mich. 

Rules for Cooking. 

Pare potatoes thin to save mineral matter. Roil potatoes 
slowly so they will not wear away. Bake potatoes rapidly. Let 
an old potato stand in cold water 1 hour before using. Never let 
a new potato stand in cold water before using. 

— Miss C. Harris. 

To Boil New Potatoes. 

These should never be peeled with a knife. Scrub and rub 
the skin until clean. Cover with boiling water and boil rapidly 
from 15 to 20 minutes with the cover on. Drain the potatoes; 
sprinkle with salt, and put back on the fire, uncovered, for a few 
minutes, to dry. Dish on a folded napkin and serve very hot.. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Select for this purpose the largest and smoothest. Put them 
in a hot oven. They will require about 1 hour. After the first 20 
minutes open the oven door every little while, take each potato in 
a coarse cloth and press it all over. This will make them mealy. 

Glacdd Sweet Potatoes. 

Take potatoes as nearly the size of an egg as possible, and bake 
until done. Pare off skin and cut in halves the long way. Put in 
bake pan, cut side down. Pour over this melted butter, and sprinkle 
with salt, pepper, brown sugar, and cracker or bread crumbs. Beat 
4 eggs until light, and pour over this, and bake in hot oven for 15 
minutes, until nicely brown, and then serve. 

— Mrs. H. C. Brown. 

Potato Au Gratin. 

Slice cold boiled potatoes. Make a cream sauce from 2 table- 
spoonfuls each of butter and flour, 1 level teaspoonful of salt, and 
one-eighth teaspoonful of pepper. Heat butter in saucepan and 
add flour and seasoning. When hot, add 1 pmt milk gradually 



118 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

and cook smoothly. Add potatoes, let heat through, and put in a 
buttered baking dish, fold in lightly some grated cheese, and bake 
10 minutes in a moderate oven. 

Take small new potatoes, peel and fry them brown in deep 
hot fat. When cooking peas add a few slices of salt pork; it im- 
parts a delicious flavor. 

Potatoes k la Union League Club. 

One quart chopped, cold boiled potatoes; ^ pint cream; 2 
tablespoons butter; 2 sweet green peppers, boiled and chopped. 
Put little pieces of butter in bottom of a baking dish; then some 
chopped potatoes and peppers, mixed; bits of butter; a sprinkling 
of flour; a little salt and cream; more potatoes and peppers; flour, 
salt and cream until potatoes are all used. Sprinkle bread crumbs 
over the top and bake 3^ hour in medium hot oven. 

Potato Puff. 

Boil enough for a meal; mash fine; put in generous piece of 
butter; add after mixing coffee cup of cream or rich milk, yolks 
of 4 eggs. Beat whites to a stiff froth and stir in quickly. Bake 
in hot oven until brown. It will take about 20 minutes. 

— Mrs. Elliott West. 

Creamed New Potatoes with Parsley. 

Drop the potatoes into boiling water and cook until they can 
be pierced with a fine skewer. Do not use the tines of a fork, 
which would burst them. Neither should you expect them to be 
mealy, for in new potatoes the starch cells are not yet developed. 
Drain and arrange in a hot vegetable dish. To make the sauce, 
put 2 level tablespoonfuls butter in a saucepan with 1 of flour. 
When melted and bubbly add a cup of thin cream and stir con- 
stantly until it boils and thickens. Then add a level teaspoonful 
salt, a dash of white or black pepper, as preferred, and a table- 
spoonful fine chopped parsley. Cook a moment longer and pour 
over the potatoes. 

Breaded Potatoes. 

Peel small potatoes and bo^'l them in salted water. Do not let 
them boil soft. Dip in beaten egg and fine cracker crumbs, and fry 
in hot fat, turning frequently, that the color may be a uniform one. 



VEGETABLES. 119 

Sweet Potatoes — Southern Style. 
Choose plump, well ripened potatoes; pare them (raw); cut 
in 2 lengthwise pieces; season with salt and pepper. In a large 
flat bottomed sauce pan put 2 tablespoons butter and 1 of sugar. 
When hot, lay in enough potatoes to cover bottom of pan, closely; 
add boiling water enough to half cover them; place on back of 
stove where heat is gentle. Cook slowly for about an hour, turn- 
ing them once. By this time the water will have evaporated, leav- 
ing a little butter sauce to pour over dish in serving. 

Cold Boiled Potatoes. 

All potatoes which are to be boiled first and then dressed must 
be boiled in their skins and set away to get cold with their skins on. 
This applies especially to potatoes to be used in hashes. It makes 
a wonderful difference and should be observed; the potato is much 
easier to cut neatly and does not crumble to pieces in the cooking. 
For potato salad made of cold potatoes they should never be cooked 
in any other way. There is, however, a delicious potato salad 
made by dressing freshly boiled, hot, mealy potatoes. 

Potatoes Saut6. 

Cut cold, boiled, peeled potatoes in slices about one-sixth of an 
inch thick. The potatoes used should be rather small, and make a 
pint sliced. Heat a large lump of butter in a saucepan. Lay the 
potatoes in, cover and stew, not fry them, in the butter. There 
must be enough butter for each slice to get its coating and absorb 
as much as it will. Mince fine, enough parsley to make a heaping 
teaspoonful, also the same quantity of chervil if at hand. Stir it 
into the potatoes; add salt and pepper, and when they have cooked 
about 15 minutes, serve. They should not be allowed to crisp or 
brown. Shake the pan from time to time to prevent sticking or 
browning. New potatoes may be sauted in this manner, but should 
be kept whole. 

Fried Potato Hash. 

Having boiled and cooled potatoes with their skins on, peel 
and chop, not too fine. Melt in a frying pan a large lump of sweet 
drippings or butter, or both mixed. Quite a large tablespoonful 
of each will be required for an ordinary dish of potatoes. When 
the butter is hot lay in the potatoes. Sprinkle generously with 
pepper and salt. Take a long knife, and every minute or two run 
it under the potatoes, turning them up from the bottom. Be care- 
ful not to mash them. Fry until the edges are well browned and 
serve. 



120 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Potatoes — Sweet or Irish. 

Peel and boil 4 or 5 potatoes; put through press; add celery 
seed, salt and sugar to taste, a cup of milk, and lump of butter 
large as a walnut. Make into balls, dip into egg, then in bread 
crumbs, and fry in deep lard. Or it can be put in baking dish and 
baked in oven. It is a good plan to prepare mixture the day be- 
fore using, it will hold together better while frying. 

— Leola Arnold. 



"Burr Oak Farm Potatoes." 

Eight eggs, boiled; 4 medium sized potatoes, boiled; dice pota- 
toes and slice eggs; put a layer of potatoes, and sprinkle a layer of 
sHced onion and then a layer of eggs; salt and pepper. Fill pan 
and pour over the following sauce: 2 tablespoons melted butter; 
2 tablespoons flour; 1 cup milk; cover with cracker crumbs and 
small pieces of butter and bake. 



Good Potatoes. 

Five or 6 grated potatoes; 2 slices white bread, soaked in 

water and squeezed out; 2 tablespoons flour; 2 or 3 tablespoons 

fat or butter; 2 eggs; salt and pepper. Bake like a pudding, 40 

minutes. 

— Mrs. Arthur Thro. 

Delicate Cabbage. 

Shred the cabbage; cover with cold milk; cook until tender, 
being careful not to scorch. Season with butter, pepper and salt. 



Stuffed Cabbage. 

Chop fine 1 pound lean beef; add 1 level teaspoon salt, 3^ 
teaspoonful ginger, and pinch of nutmeg and mace. Beat in 13^ 
cups of milk, adding a little at a time. Cut out inside of a cab- 
bage, leaving a thick wall; fill with meat. Steam until done 
and serve in slices with the sauce, or with melted butter. 

Sauce for Same: Cream 2 level tablespoons butter with 3^ 
teaspoon salt, and a dash of paprika; add the yolk of 1 egg and 1 
teaspoon lemon juice. Cook over hot water, beating all the time. 
Add 1 more yolk of egg and 2 teaspoons lemon juice, stirring all 
the time until smooth. 



VEGETABLES 121 

Summer Cabbage. 
Cut in halves or quarters. Lay in salted cold water to draw 
out any insects that may lurk inside. Drain thoroughly and put 
into a pot of salted boihng water. Do not cover. Boil 30 minutes, 
until tender. Drain very dry in a colander, pressing the water out 
with a plate. Dress with melted butter, pepper and salt, or with 
cream sauce. 

Stewed Cabbage and Celery. 
Cut into shreds equal quantities of white cabbage and celery. 
Lay for a few minutes in cold water, then drain and put into boil- 
ing, salted water. Boil gently for 20 or 30 minutes, according to 
the season. Meanwhile prepare a rich cream sauce. Drain the cab- 
bage and celery, drying as much as possible, and stir into the cream 
sauce. Let it stew very gently for 10 minutes and serve. This 
combination will be found excellent. 

Cooked Cabbage. 

One head of cabbage, chopped rather coarse; cook until ten- 
der in salted water without covering kettle; drain off water; put in 
butter the size of an egg and cook thoroughly. Then add the fol- 
lowing dressing: 3 tablespoons sour cream; 1 tablespoon sugar; 
yolk of 1 egg; beat together and add 2 tablespoons vinegar. Stir 
into the cabbage and let just come to a boil. 

— Mrs. J. L. Keep. 

Cabbage with Custard. 
Chop cabbage and cook in half milk and half water without 
cover, until tender. This takes about 3^ hour. Drain; beat 3 eggs 
very light; add 3 tablespoons vinegar, 1^^ tablespoons sugar, salt 
and pepper; beat together. Melt in cabbage a large tablespoon 
butter. Pour dressing over cabbage and cook till like custard. Serve 
at once. This amount of dressing is sufficient for cabbage enough 
to serve 4 people. — Mrs. O. R. Brouse. 

Baked Cauliflower with Cheese Sauce. 

Boil a cauliflower in salted water until tender. Cut off stalk 
of cauliflower so it will stand upright, and place in a buttered 
dish suitable for the table. Make a cream sauce of 1 tablespoon 
butter, 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 cup scalding milk. Season with 
pepper and salt; add 34 cup grated cheese. Stir in piece of butter; 
then pour sauce over cauliflower. Sprinkle with the grated cheese

CHAPTER XII. i 

PASTRY. 

"Who'll dare deny the truth, there's poetry in pie." 

It is quite essential in making good pastry that all utensils 
should be as cold as possible and as little water as possible should 
be used. Ice water or the very coldest obtainable should be used 
in mixing pastry. Pastry should be kneaded very slightly. The 
less it is handled the better. 

A small pinch of baking powder may be added to pie crust, 
if desired. A little white of egg spread over bottom crust of a pie 
before pouring in the filling will help to keep the crust from soaking. 

Pie crust will be browner and more flaky if about 1^^ table- 
spoonfuls of cream or rich milk be spread over the surface before 
baking.

Chou Paste. 

To make chou paste put Y^ cup of butter and 1 cup of water 
into a sauce pan and place on fire; when boiling, stir in 1 cup flour 
^and beat vigorously until the mixture is smooth and leaves the 
side of the pan. Turn into a bowl and add 4 eggs, beating each one 
in separately, until smooth. This may be served with soup, by 
dropping from a spoon into deep fat frying until brown, or dropping 
on a pan and baking in moderate oven. This may be used for 
cream puffs, by dropping on buttered pans in circular forms, 
higher in the center. Bake 30 minutes in moderate oven with 
strongest heat at bottom, as puffs must rise quickly and be light 
before browning on top. They scorch easily, but must be well 
baked lest they fall. 

Cheese puff balls are made like the puffs with the addition of a 
rounding tablespoonful of cheese (grated), which is stirred into the 
mixture before the egg is added. — Amelia Sulzbacher.

they are cooked.

CHAPTER XIII. 



HOT PUDDINGS. 



"The daintiest last to make the end more sweet." 

It is said, "One of the best uses of originality is to say common 
things in an uncommon way." One of the next best uses is in serv- 
ing common things in uncommon ways for — "Variety alone gives 
joy; the sweetest meats the soonest cloy." 

How to Insure the Best Results. 

Always butter pudding molds well. If the pudding is to be 
boiled in a mold, use a covered mold. Stand in boiling water and 
boil continuously until done. Have the water come up as high as 
the pudding in the mold. 

If a bag is used, it should be of thick cotton. Dip the bag in 
hot water and flour the inside well. Plunge immediately in hot 
water. When done, dip the bag in cold water and the pudding will 
turn out easily. Put a plate on the bottom of the kettle to keep 
the pudding from burning. 

When a pudding is to be steamed, have the pudding mold a 
little smaller round than the steamer used. Lay a cloth over the 
top of the steamer and cover steamer closely. Do not uncover the 
steamer or jar it till the pudding is done. 

In boiling or steaming puddings never allow the water to stop 
boiling till pudding is done. If more water has to be added it must 
be at the boiling point. 

When raisins are used in puddings, put them in dry and well 
floured. If put in wet, the pudding will be heavy.

be of a consistency to be packed and piressed into buttered pud- 
ding boilers, and should cook 10 hours. During the making of this

CHAPTER XV. 



COLD DESSERTS. 



Suggestions. 

Milk is at a scald in a double boiler when bubbles form around 
the edge. 

A little salt should be added to all custards and it is an im- 
provement to nearly all puddings. 

The dish containing souffles or custards should be set in a pan 
of hot water while baking. 

When a ring mold or a border mold is not available, a very 
good substitute is to place a basin or bowl inside of another, using 
the space between for a mold. When the mold is set the inner basin 
can be readily removed by pouring into it a little hot water. 

When cream will not beat readily, often the white of an egg 
dropped into 3^ pint cream will bring the desired result. 

When cream will not whip as stiff as desired, add a little dis- 
solved gelatine, cooled, and allow to stand for a while on ice. 

Never use gelatine with raw pineapple. It will not jelly. Raw 
pineapple juice cuts the gelatine. 

In case any kind of custard being cooked in a double boiler 
curdles, remove at once and set in cold water and beat with a dover 
egg beater. This will often recall it. 

Strawberries, cherries, currant clusters, and grapes are all 
pretty for garnishings. 

Fruits en perle are prepared by dipping them first in slightly 
beaten whites of eggs, then rolling in granulated sugar and allow- 
ing to dry. 

To glace fruits, boil sugar and water syrup till it ropes, then 
dip fruit in and allow to harden. 

Fruits may be also dipped in melted fondant, colored any de- 
sired shade.

AND FROSTINGS, GINGERBREAD. 



General Directions for Cake Making. 

In baking a cake have all the necessary articles ready. But- 
ter the pan in which the cake is to be baked. Break the eggs, the 
yolks in one bowl and the whites in another. Measure the sifted 
flour and sugar and set them aside. Then measure the milk or 
water to be used and the baking powder or soda, or cream of tartar. 
Sift the flour with the baking powder or whatever is to be used to 
lighten the cake. Have the fruit or nuts ready to add to the bat- 
ter when needed. When this is all done, cream the butter in your 
mixing bowl. A perforated spoon is the best to use for this. Then 
gradually beat in the sugar. If your recipe calls for yolks, beat 
them till light and thick, then add to the butter and sugar. Then 
add the liquid alternately with the flour. Lastly add the whites, 
beaten stiff. Fruit or nuts may now be added. If you flour the fruit 
before adding it to the batter, it will not sink to the bottom of the 
cake while baking. When putting the batter in the pan, it is a good 
plan to spread it away from the center towards the edges with a 
spoon so that the cake will be of a uniform height when baked. 

An entirely different method is used in mixing a sponge cake. 
First beat the yolks till thick and light colored. Gradually beat in 
the sugar and then add the flavoring, (grated rind of an orange or 
lemon) and lemon juice, if used. Then beat the whites till stiff. 
Add part of the whites to the yolks and sugar, then add part of the 
flour, then add the remaining whites and the rest of the flour. In 
making a sponge cake no stirring must be done. The lightness of 
the cake depends upon the air beaten into the eggs. The cake 
should be mixed entirely by cutting and folding. 

In baking a cake the oven should be at a temperature to raise 
the cake to its full height in one-fourth the time required for bak- 
ing. The cake should not brown during this time. During the 



232 ^ THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK, 

second quarter the cake should brown a very Httle. During the 
third quarter it should finish browning. The heat of the oven 
should be reduced during the last half of the time. Cakes in which 
butter has been used will separate from the sides of the pan w^p'" 
baked. W

LOAF CAKES. 

One Egg Spice Cake. 

One cup si^ar, heaping (light yellow coffee C sugar); 1 egg; 
Yi cup butter (scant); 1 cup rich sour milk; 1 small teaspoon soda 
(beaten well into milk); 2 cups flour (measured before sifting); 1 
heaping teaspoon ground cinnamon; 3^ teaspoon cloves (ground); 
3^ teaspoon of nutmeg or mace (ground); 1 large cLj^raisins, seeded, 
and cut in two with scissors (not chopped). Bake in a pan about 4 
inches deep in a very slow oven. This cake i» very moist and keeps 
so for a long time. 

Frosting: 1 lemon (juice); 1 pound confectioner's sugar 
(scant). Squeeze the^ juice from the lemon, strain and add the 
sugar little by little, beating all the time till it becomes very creamy 
and do.es not drop off the spoon when held up. A wire spoon is 
the best to beat it with. The success of this simple, but delicious 
frosting, depends on the beating altogether. Spread on the cake 
when the latter is cold.

CHAPTER XIX. 



FRUITS. 



"Bring me berries or such cooling fruit 
As the kind, hospitable woods provide." 

— COWPEB. 



"Eat an apple every day and live forever." 



Ripe fruit is very appropriate and healthy for breakfast, and 
during the summer months is much more to be desired for dessert 
at dinner than rich pastry or hot puddings. Fruit should always 
be served as fresh and cold as possible. As a rule fruits should be 
arranged in a raised dish or comport. In serving mixed fruits 
whole, allow clusters of grapes to fall over the sides of the dish. In 
serving on a low tray or platter, pile apples, oranges, bananas or 
other large fruit first on the tray and arrange clusters of grapes to 
fall over the whole. 

Grapes. 

There is no more beautiful table decoration than grapes. 
Their exquisite coloring of purple, green, amber and red together 
with their own leaves making a combination for beauty impos- 
sible to surpass. 

The large hot house grapes piled on a cut glass 6pergne and 
with the stems tied together with a large bow of broad soft satin 
ribbon the same color as the grapes, make a most artistic center- 
piece for a dinner table. The epergne can be passed to the guests 
at the close of the dinner and small bunches may be cut from the 
cluster with silver grape scissors. 

Another attractive table decoration for autumn is to have a 
high fruit standard of gold and white Bohemian glass in the center 
with two tall comports to match, one for each end of the table, 
filled with different colored grapes, with small bunches hanging 



256 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

over the edges. The Tiffany colored high dishes, which are now- 
sold very cheaply, are beautiful for holding grapes as their color- 
ing is identical with the fruit. 



Cantaloupe Melons. 

A very delicious way to serve cantaloupe is to cut them in 
halves, crosswise. Remove seeds and membrane and put on ice. 
When time to serve, put one half on a grape leaf on each plate and 
in it put a heaping tablespoon of pineapple ice and serve immedi- 
ately. 

Musk Melons and Whipped Cream Surprise. 

Select small melons and chill. Cut off a section that may 
serve as a lid and carefully clean. Then fill with whipped cream, 
sweetened and mixed with a little chopped preserved ginger and 
marshmallows cut fine with scissors. Cover with lid. Carefully 
pack in a rather deep pan and surround with chopped ice and 
salt. Let stand 1 hour. • Draw a narrow yellow ribbon through 
the lid tied in a bow. Serve on a platter filled with crushed ice 
and garnished with nasturtiums and their leaves. 

Musk Melon Basket. 

Cut 2 pieces from small melons in such a way as to form a 
handle. Take out the pulp, membrane and seeds. Cut the pulp in 
small cubes, sprinkle with fine sugar and chill thoroughly. When 
ready to serve, place each melon basket on a grape leaf on a pretty 
plate, fill with the chilled pulp and serve at once. 

Compote of Oranges. 
Peel and skin 6 oranges. Cut into halves crosswise and with 
a sharp pointed vegetable knife remove the cores and seeds. Boil 
1 cup of sugar with 1 cup of water and add the juice of 3^ lemon. 
Arrange the oranges right side up in a round fruit dish, pour over 
the syrup very slowly and fill the centers with boiled rice and serve 
at once. They may be garnished with chopped almonds, candied 
cherries or chopped candied pineapple. 

Compote of Pears. 

Cut thin slices of bread into pear shaped pieces. Toast -them 
in the oven till they are a golden brown. Pare and cut the pears 



FRUITS. 257 

into halves and remove cores. Boil ]/^ cup of sugar, 1 cup of water 
and the juice of 1 lemon. Put the pears into the syrup and cook 
slowly 5 minutes. Arrange toast on a dish and put half a pear on 
each slice. Put yi pound of candied cherries into the syrup and 
bring to a boiling point. Heap cherries into the center of the dish 
and pour the syrup over the whole. 

Watermelon. 

Watermelon should be thoroughly chilled before using. There 
are various ways of serving this beautiful fruit. The old-fashioned 
way of slicing crosswise and bringing to the table on a large plat- 
ter is always appetizing. It may also be cut lengthwise. A new 
and pretty way to serve is to cut in two crosswise and with a potato 
scoop, scoop out little round balls, soak in Sherry and serve 
either in half a cantaloupe or pile on a grape leaf on a small plate. 

Watermelon Hearts. 

Chill a watermelon and cut in ^ inch slices. With a heart 
shaped cookie cutter, cut out from slices as many hearts as de- 
sired. Arrange on a platter in several piles and surround with 
crushed ice. Garnish with mint. 



Rose Pineapple. 

Put a slice of pineapple on a small plate with a wreath of 
smilax around it. Take juice of pineapple and make a thick syrup 
of it, almost a jelly; color pink with fruit coloring put a tablespoon- 
ful on top of pineapple and heap whipped cream on top. Nice for 
course at luncheon or dinner. 

— Mrs. Fanny Moffatt. 

Strawberries. 
The most beautiful way to serve strawberries is to select fine, 
large berries, 6 or 8 for a person, and place them on a plate with- 
out being hulled, on their own leaves if possible to get them. Have 
a molded mound of pulverized sugar in the center and arrange 
the berries around it. 

Strawberry Cocktail. 
Add to the juice of 3 oranges the juice of 1 lemon and fine 
sugar to taste, making the mixture rather tart; stir until the sugar 



258 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

* is dissolved, then put on ice. Stem, wash and chill some fine 
strawberries. When ready to serve, cut the berries in halves and 
put into champagne glasses, pour over the fruit juice and add a 
tablespoon of cracked ice. This makes a dainty first course for 
a luncheon or dinner. 

Strawberry Tarts. 
Line small patty pans with a rich pie crust and bake. Just 
before serving fill with fresh strawberries dusted with powdered 
sugar. Whip some rich cream until stiff, add sugar to sweeten and 
flavor with pineapple or orange. Pile it high over the berries and 
serve at once. 

Grape Fruit. 

Cut grape fruit into halves crosswise. With a sharp pointed 
vegetable knife cut around the edge of the pulp to loosen, also cut 
between the divisions of the pulp, remove core and seeds. Sprinkle 
with sugar and pour over it 1 tablespoon of apricot brandy and 
put a Maraschino cherry in the top of each half. Baskets may 
be made economically in serving for several people by having an 
extra grape fruit. Skin it carefully and cut the skin into strips 
about 3^ or 3^ an inch wide. Pin a strip for a handle on each pre- 
pared half and wind with a little smilax. Serve very cold. 

Cherries. 

California cherries, either the light red or dark red, make a 
beautiful first course for a breakfast or luncheon by putting them 
in a pan with chopped ice with the stems on till they are very cold. 
When ready to serve, take 6 or 7 for each plate. Wipe them and 
tie the stems together, to make a bunch, with red satin baby rib- 
bon. Serve on small green leaves and have a little mound of pul- 
verized sugar on each plate. 

Cherry Salad. 
Select firm, large cherries; remove pit and insert a filbert or 
part of English walnut meat. Moisten with French salad dress- 
ing and serve in lemon peel cups, 

— Mrs. H. T. Goddard. 

Peach Snow Balls. 
Pare nice peaches. Roll in powdered sugar, then in melted 
fondant, tinted pink with fruit coloring; then roll in fresh grated 
coeoanut. 



FRUITS. 259 



Ambrosia. 



One dozen sweet oranges (skin and slice); 1 large fresh cocoa- 
nut (grated). Put alternate layers of the orange and grated cocoa- 
nut in a glass dish and sprinkle pulverized sugar over each layer 
of the cocoanut. This is an old-fashioned dish, but is delicious and 

palatable. 

—Mrs. S. W. C. 



Slices of orange dipped in spiced wine is a famous dessert in 
Jaffa. 

A Favorite Dessert.

with the sugar and brandy between. Do not cook it at all. Many 
people start their tutti-frutti in the early summer, adding to it as 
the fruits come along, and adding other fruits, always keeping the 
same quantity of sugar and brandy in proportion. Delicious with 
ice cream or meats. 

Tutti-Frutti of Candied Fruits.

a glass dish. 



FRUITS. 261 

Apple Sauce. 
Six tart apples; 1 cup sugar; % cup water. Boil sugar and 
water. Pare, core and quarter apples and cook in the syrup 3 or 4 
minutes or until tender. Take out the apples and boil the syrup

Devonshire Cream. 

Put 4 quarts of milk in a shallow pan, let it stand in a cool 
place over night. In the morning set it carefully on the stove so 
as not to disturb and bring it very slowly almost to a boil. Then 
place in a cold place and when thoroughly chilled, remove the 
cream carefully. The English prepare this Devonshire cream for 
almost constant use. It is delicious on strawberries, raspberries 
or peaches.

CHAPTER XX. 

CANDY AND CONFECTIONS. 



"A wilderness of sweets." 

— Milton — Paradise Lost. 

The art of making candy is easily learned. It is cheaper to 
make good candy at home than to buy good store candy, and 
cheap candy should not be eaten, as it is frequently adulter- 
ated. When one has learned how to boil sugar for fondants, to dip 
chocolate and to properly cook caramels and other similar candies, 
it will be found comparatively easy to produce many toothsome 
dainties. 

One advantage of home-made candy is the choice it affords 
of flavoring ingredients and combinations. In nut candy it is pos- 
sible to attain a great variety from the same recipes by utilizing 
the less common kinds of nuts. Crystalized fruits also permit of a 
large* range of choice, while fresh fruits coated with fondant are 
always popular. 

Boiled Sugar for Confections. 

Eleven tests are considered for boiling sugar: — 
Small thread, 215 degrees F. The feather, 232 degrees F. 

Large thread, 217 degrees F. Soft ball, 238 degrees F. 

Pearl, 220 degrees F. Hard ball, 248 degrees F. 

Large pearl, 222 degrees F. Small crack, 290 degrees F. 

The blow, 230 degrees F. Crack, 310 degrees F. 

Caramel, 350 degrees F. 

Fondant, the basis of all French candy, is made of sugar and 
water boiled together (with a small quantity of cream of tartar to 
prevent sugar from granulating) to soft ball, 238 degrees F. The 
professional confectioner is able to decide when syrup has boiled 
to the right temperature by sound while boiling, and by testing 
in cold water; these tests at first seem somewhat difficult to the 
amateur, but only a little experience is necessary to make fondant 
successfully. A sugar thermometer is often employed, and proves 
valuable, as by its use one need not exercise his judgment. 



CANDY AND CONFECTIONS. 263 

White Fondant. 

Two and one-half pounds sugar (5 cups); 1^ cups hot water; 
yi teaspoon cream tartar. Put ingredients in a smooth granite 
stew pan; stir, place on range, and heat gradually to boiling point. 
Boil, without stirring, until when tried in cold water a soft ball 
may be formed that will just keep in shape, which is 238 degrees F. 
After a few minutes boiling, sugar will adhere to sides of kettle; 
remove this with a wooden spoon, covered with cloth to prevent 
fondant from granulating. Pour slowly on a slightly oiled marble 
slab. Let stand a few minutes to cool, but not long enough to be- 
come hard around the edge. Scrape fondant with chopping-knife 
to one end of marble and work with a wooden spatula until white 
and creamy. It will quickly change from this consistency and be- 
gin to lump when it should be kneaded with the hands until per- 
fectly smooth. Put into a bowl and cover with oiled paper to 
exclude the air, that a crust may. not form on top and let stand 24 
hours. A large oiled platter and a wooden spoon may be used in 
place of a marble slab and spatula. Always make fondant on a 
clear day, as a damp and heavy atmosphere has an unfavorable 
effect on the boiling of sugar. Fondant may be kept several months 
and is better after it is made some time. 

For large quantity of fondant: 10 pounds sugar; 5 pints water; 
2 teaspoons cream of tartar. 

Coffee Fondant. 

Two and one-half pounds sugar; ^ cup ground coffee; 13^ 
cups cold water; 34 teaspoon cream of tartar. Put water and coffee 
in sauce pan and heat to boiling point. Strain through double 
cheese cloth, then add sugar and cream of tartar and cook as white 
fondant. 

Maple Fondant. 

One and one-fourth pounds maple sugar; 1 cup hot water; 
IM pounds granulated sugar; 3€ teaspoon cream of tartar. Mix 
maple and granulated sugar and add remaining ingredients and 
cook as white fondant. 

Bon Bens. 

(a) Centers of bon bons are made of fondant. Shaped in 
small balls. If white fondant is used, flavor as desired. 

(b) Cocoanut centers: Work as much shredded cocoanut as 
possible into small amount of fondant. 



264 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

(c) Nut centers: Surround the nut meats with fondant, 
chopped or whole meats, as desired. 

(d) French candied cherries are excellent as centers. Cover 
with fondant. 

(e) Lemon juice and powdered sugar may be mixed to form 
balls and orange juice may also be used. 

(f) One teaspoon of strained raspberry jam and enough pow- 
dered sugar to make stiff paste, makes excellent centers. 

(g) Grape jelly may also be used; allow balls to stand over 
night. '• 

To Dip Bon Bens. 

Put fondant in sauce pan and melt over hot water. Color 
and flavor as desired. Dip balls into melted fondant and put on 
oil paper. 



Dipped Walnuts, 
avor; dip halves 
oil paper. Pecans or whole blanched almonds may be used 



Melt fondant and flavor; dip halves of walnuts and place on 



Cream Nut .Bars. 

1. Melt fondant and flavor. Stir in any kind of nut meats. 
Cut in pieces. Turn -n oiled paper or pan. Cool and cut in bars 
with sharp knife. 

2. Maplo fondant is delicious with nuts. 

Chocolate Creams. 
Roll some of the fondant into small balls and press these flat 
between 2 halves of English walnuts. Melt a cake of bitter, un- 
sweetened chocolate in a basin of hot water for covering the can- 
dies with chocolate. Take the candies, one at a time, on a tooth- 
pick and pour the melted chocolate over them with a teaspoon, 
and when well covered, slip them upon oiled paper. 

Mints. 

The mints with any desired flavoring, such as peppermint, 
wintergreen, vanilla or lemon, may be made by stirring some of 
the fondant in a double boiler until it melts. Add the flavoring 
and drop in small lum^ on oiled paper. The lump will flatten out 
before hardening.

quartered, and the pineapple is cut in slices half an inch thick 
across the fruit. The coarse fibre of the centre should be cut out 
of each slice. Weigh the fruit, and allow an equal quantity of the 
best white sugar. Make a rich syrup of a small cup of water to 
each pound of sugar. Boil for a few minutes, then add the fruit, 
and cook gently until it is transparent. Remove the fruit carefully 
onto a wire strainer, and let stand until perfectly cold. Then

DRINKS AND BEVERAGES. 



Drink to me only with thine eyes 

And I will pledge with mine 
Or leave a kiss but in the cup 

And I'll not ask for wine. 

The thirst that from the soul doth rise 

Doth ask a drink divine; 
But might I of Jove's nectar sup 

I would not change from thine.

WINES. 



God made Man frail as a bubble 

God made Love — Love made Trouble. 

God made the Vine; was it a sin 

That Man made Wine to drown Trouble in? 

— Anon. 



The rule for service of wine at a dinner party calls for white 
wine with the fish. Sherry with the soup. Claret and champagne 
with the roast. Maderia and port wines with the game. Maderia 
and port are decanted and should not be cold, but of the tempera- 
ture of the room. Champagne is either sweet or "dry" and must 
not be decanted, but kept in ice pails and opened when needed. 

Wine is good 

Love is good 

And all is good if understood. 

The sin is not in doing

To Mull Wine. 
An Excellent French Recipe. 
Boil in a wineglassful and a half of water a quarter of an ounce 
of spice (cinnamon, ginger slightly bruised, and cloves), with 3 
ounces of fine sugar till they form a thick syrup, which must not, 
on any account, be allowed to burn. Pour in a pint of port wine 
and stir it gently till it is on the point of boiling only; it should 
then be served immediately. The addition of a strip or two of 
orange rind, cut extremely thin, gives to this beverage the flavor 
of bishop. In France light claret takes the place of port wine in 
making this, and the better kinds of Vins du Pays are very palatable 
thus prepared: Water, \}/^ wineglassful; spice, 34 ounce, to make 
which quantity use about 24 cloves and the rest of the amount in 
rather more ginger than cinnamon, and 3 ounces of sugar. Boil 15 
to 20 minutes. Port wine or claret, 1 pint, added last. If orange 
rind is used, it should be boiled with the spices. (Taken from an 
old English cook book, published in 1845). 

Port Wine. 

Good imported port wine, 3 gallons; good prepared cider, 12 
gallons; juice of elderberries, 3 gallons: good brandy, \}/2 gallons; 
cochineal, 3 ounces. Pulverize the cochineal very fine, put it with 
the brandy into a stone jug; let it remain at least 2 weeks. Have 
cider ready and put 6 gallons of the cider into a 20 gallon cask. 
Add to this the elder juice, port wine, brandy and cochineal. Take 
the remaining 6 gallons of cider with part of which clean out your 
jug that contained the brandy, and pour the whole into the cask; 
bung it tight and in 6 weeks it \n\\\ be ready for use. 

Wines — Currant, Blackberry or Elderberry. 

These all have powerful medicinal properties, and every fam- 
ily should have at least one kind on hand. The cost of the wine 
is nothing compared to the benefit derived from using it, when 
needed, as it often saves the expense of medicines, as well 
as doctor's bills, besides being more palatable to take than medicine. 

Red or White Currant Wine. 

First place the fruit in a tub or jar and mash or crush it. A 

better way is to put it in a kettle over the fire, crushing some of the 

fruit when first put in, and adding a very little water, just enough 

to keep it from burning. Boil until Soft, then put through a cloth 



DRINKS AND BEVERAGES. 277 

lined cylinder. To each quart of juice obtained, add 3 quarts of 
water and 2}/^ to 3 pounds of sugar, according to taste. Put the 
mixture in a keg, leaving the cork or bung loose, or put it in a tub 
or jar, covering the same with a thin cloth so that the air may 
have access to it. Set it aside and allow it to ferment for about 10 
days, or until fermentation ceases. It is a good plan- to skim it 
occasionally with a perforated skimmer while fermenting. After 
that pour it in bottles or jugs, allowing the corks to remain very 
loose, as it will work again for 2 or 3 days. Then when through 
working, take out the corks and fill bottles with juice reserved for 
that purpose. After all signs of fermentation cease, put in the 
corks very tight, tie or wire them in and seal. Wine is best kept 
in a cool place. Blackberry, elderberry, grape or rhubarb wine 
may be made in the same way with the exception that a smaller 
proportion of sugar is required for blackberry and elderberry wine. 



Elderberry Wine No. II. 
Water, 5 gallons; elderberry, 5 gallons; white sugar, 22 pounds; 
red tartar, 4 ounces. Put these into cask, and add a little yeast 
and let it ferment. When undergoing fermentation, add ginger 
root, 2 ounces; allspice, 2 ounces; cloves, 3^ ounce. Put them into 
clean cotton bag and suspend in the cask. They give a pleasant 
flavor to the wine, which will become clear in about 2 months, 
and may then be drawn off and bottled. 



Currant Wine No. II. 

Take 1 pailful of water to every pailful of currants on the stem. 
Wash and strain; add 334 pounds of sugar to every gallon of the 
mixture of juice and water. Mix well and put into the cask, which 
should be placed in the cellar on the tilt, so that it can easily be 
racked off in October without stirring up the sediment. 2 bushels 
of currants will make 1 barrel of wine. Fill the barrel within 3 
inches of the bung, and make it air-tight by placing wet clay over 
it after it is driven in. 

Cherry Wine. 

To make 10 pints of this wine take 30 pounds of cherries and 

4 pounds of currants; bruise and mix them together. Mix with 

them % of the kernels and put the whole mixture into a barrel 

with 34 pound of sugar to every pint of juice. The barrel should 



278 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

be quite full. Cover the barrel with vine leaves and sand above 
them, and let stand in a cool place until through working, which 
will be in about 3 weeks; then stop it with a bung and in 2 months 
it may be bottled. 

Apple Wine. 

To each gallon of cider, as soon as it comes from the press, 
add 2 pounds of loaf sugar; boil as long as any scum arises, then 
strain through a sieve and let it cool; now add some good yeast, 
mix well; let it work in the tub 2 or 3 weeks, then skim off the 
scum; draw it off close and turn it; let it stand about a year, then 
rack it off and add 2 ounces of isinglass to the barrel; then add }4. 
pint spirits of wine to every 8 gallons. 

Note — The old recipes all speak of gelatine as isinglass. 

Ginger Wine. 

Bruised ginger, 4 ounces; lump sugar, 10 pounds; water, 5 
gallons. Add 2 eggs. Boil well and skim. Then pour hot on 3 or 4 
lemons, cut in slices. Macerate for 2 hours, then rack and ferment. 
Add spirits, 1 quart; finings, ^ pint; rummage well; to make color, 
boil saleratus, 3^ ounce; alum, 3^ ounce; in 1 pint of water till 
you get a bright color. 

Lemon Wine. 

Water, 15 gallons; raisins (bruised) 8 pounds; sugar, 30 pounds. 
Boil, then add cider, 7 gallons; ferment and add spirits, 13^ gal- 
lons; white tartar, 6 ounces; essence of lemon, 1 ounce; finings, 3^ 
pint. Shake well the essence with a pint of the spirit until it be- 
comes milky before adding to the wine. 



Dandelion Wine. 

Two quarts of blossoms without any stems (which would make 
the wine bitter). Pour over them 1 gallon of boiling water and 
let stand 3 days and nights, then strain and add 3 pounds of white 
sugar, 2 sliced lemons and 2 sliced oranges. Boil for 5 minutes. 
When cooled sufficiently to be about milk warm, add 1 tablespoon- 
ful of good yeast and put in a jug to ferment. Keep the jug full 
until fermentation ceases, and bottle in about 6 weeks. 

— Mrs. W. p. Lamb.

Grape Wine. 

Water, 4 quarts; grape juice, 4 quarts; sugar, 8 pounds. Ex- 
tract the juice in any simple way, if only a few quarts are desired. 
One can do it with a strainer and a pair of squeezers. Use per- 
fectly ripe grapes. After the first pressing, put a little water with 
the pulp and press a second time, using the juice of the second 
pressing with the water to be mixed with the clear grape juice. 
Put in a keg and fill even full. After fermentation has taken 
place and the scum removed, drain off, bottle and cork tightly. 



Unfermented Wine. 

Pick the grapes well ripened; remove carefully all decayed 
and unripe fruit. Mixed varieties of grapes may be used. Ex- 
press the juice and boil as long as any scum arises; skim carefully 
from time to time; do not boil over an hour; bottle it while hot, 
and seal either in glass bottles, jugs or air-tight casks. It is in 
condition to be used at any time, but after it is once opened it 
must not be allowed to ferment. With the exception of straw- 
berry syrup, this will be found to be the most delightful and ex- 
hilarating of all unfermented beverages. It needs no sugar, and 
may be diluted when served. 



Unfermented Grape Juice. 

Ten cupfuls Concord grapes; 6 cupfuls water; 2 cupfuls sugar. 
Mash the grapes and cook in 3 cups of the water; strain; add to 
the skins and seeds 3 more cups of water and cook again; strain. 
Add to the strained juice the 2 cups of sugar and' boil 5 minutes. 
Skim, bottle hot in air-tight jars. In serving, add sugar and sliced 
lemon or lemon juice, ice and the grape juice. This is a simple, 
but delicious drink.

CORDIALS. 

For highest cordials all their virtues lose 
By a too frequent and too bold a use. 
And what would cheer the spirits in distress, 
Ruins our health when taken to excess. 

— John Pomfret, in "The Choice." 

Mint Cordial. 
Crush a large bunch of mint and soak the leaves for 1 hour in 
the strained juice of 2 lemons and the grated rind of 1. Cook to- 
gether 1 pint of water and the same amount of sugar until the 
syrup threads. Take from fire and stir into it the lemon and mint, 
the juice of an orange and, if at hand, an equal amount of pine- 
apple juice. Strain and add enough cold water to make a rich 
beverage. Ice and serve. The use of apollinaris water or seltzer 
improves it. 

Blackberry Cordial. 

Put berries in a kettle with a very little water and cook until 
soft, then turn into a press cylinder, first putting in a thin muslin 
cloth large enough to fold over the top of the fruit. After pressing 
out the juice add to each pint of juice 1 pound of loaf sugar, }/^ 
ounce of powdered cinnamon, 3^ ounce of mace, 2 teaspoonfuls 
of whole cloves and boil all together for 15 minutes and strain. To 
each quart add 1 pint of good French brandy. It is then ready to 
be bottled. Before using, dilute with water, if necessary. This 
syrup is a sovereign remedy for all summer complaints. 



Quince Cordial. 

Use ripe, sound quinces; rub off fur, cut in small pieces; pour 
over just enough cold water to cover, and simmer until the pulp 
is soft. Put in a double cheese cloth bag and let it drip over night. 
Do not squeeze or press because what remains in the bag can be 
taken through a sieve and used for marmalade. Measure the j nice, add 
3^ pint of granulated sugar to each pint of liquid, also 2 blanched 
peach kernels. To 3 pints allow 2 cloves. Boil for 15 minutes. 
Skim well, remove from fire, strain and add ]/^ pint of brandy to 
each pint of syrup. Turn into a stone jar, protect the opening 
with cheese cloth, let stand a week and then bottle and cork se- 
curely. It may be used in 2 months, but is better if kept 1 year.

CIDER. 



"The cups that cheer but not inebriate wait on each." 

— Wm. Cowper. 

Pear, Orange, Grape or Apple Cider. 
Cider may be made from pears, oranges or grapes as well as 
from apples. Put the fruit over the fire with barely enough water 
to keep from burning, and cover, letting it steam or cook slowly 
until soft. Press out all juice and the result is a pure cider. In 
making orange cider, peel fruit and it is then easily pressed with- 
out heating. 

To Keep Cider Sweet. 

Cider may be kept sweet for 10 years by first putting it in a 
kettle and bringing it to a boil. Set bottles in a pan of cold water 
on the stove and allow the same to come to a boiling heat. Fill 
the bottles, as they stand in the hot water, with the cider. Set 
aside to cool, then cork and seal. 



Champagne Cider. 

Make cider from foregoing recipe and after filling strong pop 
bottles, add 3 raisins and 1 teaspoonful of syrup or sugar to each 
pint of juice. Wire corks in tightly and seal. 



BEER. 



"I do now remember the poor creature, small beer," 

— King Henry IV. 

Cottage Beer. 

Water, 10 gallons; good sweet wheat bran, 1 peck; good hops, 
3 handfuls. Boil all together until the bran and hops sink to the 
bottom. Strain through a thin cloth and when about luke warm, 
add 2 quarts of molasses. As soon as the molasses is melted pour 
the whole into a 9 or 10 gallon cask, with 2 tablespoons of yeast. 
When fermentation ceases, bung up the cask and in about 4 days 
it will be readv for use. 



282 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Ginger Beer. 

Honey, 1 pound; sugar, 20 pounds; lemon juice, 18 ounces; 
yeast, 6 pints; water, 18 gallons; bruised ginger root, 22 ounces. 
Boil the ginger 3^ hour in a gallon of water, then add the rest of 
the water and the other ingredients, and strain, when cool. Add 
the whites of 2 eggs, beaten, and 1 ounce of essence of lemon. Let 
it stand for 4 days and then bottle and it will keep a long time if 
you don't drink it. 

Hops Beer. 

Hops, 6 ounces; water, 5 quarts. Boil 3 hours, then strain 
off the liquor. Pour on 4 quarts of water and 12 spoonfuls of gin- 
ger and boil the hops 3 hours longer. Strain it and mix with the 
other liquor and stir in 2 quarts of molasses. Brown, very dry, 3^ 
pound of bread and put in — rusked bread is best. Pound fine and 
brown in a pot like coffee. After it has cooled so that it is luke 
warm, add a pint of new yeast that is free from salt. Keep the 
barrel covered in a cool place until fermentation ceases, which you 
may know by the settling of the post. Turn into kegs or bottles 
and keep in a cool place. 

Jamaica Ginger Beer. 

One 4 ounce bottle of Jamaica ginger; 1 ounce cream of tartar; 
6 quarts of water; 1 pound of sugar; grated rind of 1 lemon. Mix

CHAPTER XXIL 



CHAFING DISH RECIPES. 



Over forty years ago, before the days of dining cars on the 
railroads, a party of Chicago gentlemen decided to take a journey 
to the Pacific Coast. Those were not the days of rapid transit and 
a journey to California meant a week or more of travel. It was 
the custom then for the trains to stop at railroad eating 
houses "twenty minutes for refreshments" and very poor meals 
they were. Not relishing the idea of eating such food these trav- 
elers tried an entirely new experiment. There was living in Chi- 
cago at that time a young man by the name of Kinsley, who kept 
a small restaurant. His reputation for cooking was excellent. 
One of the party was delegated to ask Mr. Kinsley if he would go 
with them and in some way manage to cook for them some good 
meals on the train. He consented to do so, carried food and chafing 
dishes and with the latter alone cooked and served to the party 
delicious meals of all kinds during the entire journey. He gained 
a great reputation for this and it was the beginning of his career 
as a famous caterer of national repute. He amassed a large for- 
tune and became one of the leading business men of Chicago. 

In a chafing dish can be cooked potatoes and other vegetables 
in various ways, eggs in all styles, cheese, oysters, clams, lobsters 
in many ways, birds, prairie chicken, steaks, chops, mushrooms, 
sweetbreads and many kinds of desserts. 

Chicken Terrapin. 
Put in the chafing dish the dark meat of cold chicken, turkey 
or shrimp; cut in small pieces, with a pint of cream or stock and 
when it comes to a boil, stir in the following mixture: 2 table- 
spoons of butter, rubbed into a smooth paste with a tablespoon 
of flour, and the yolks of 3 eggs; a teaspoonful of dry mustard; a 
little cayenne pepper and salt, all mixed with a little cream or 
stock. Let it simmer a few minutes (not boil) and serve. 

— Mrs. J. D. Waterman.

CHAPTER XXIII. 

JELLIES, CANNING, PRESERVES, 
PICKLES. 

"Hunger is the best seasoning for meat." 
JELLIES. 



Jelly Making. 

If acid fruits or juices are boiled with cane sugar, the sugar, 
under the influence of heat and moisture, and because of the acid, 
is divided into two sugars, one-half of which is dextrose, the other 
half levulose. The latter is usually in a syrup form. Syrup-like 
jelly has been boiled too long, because the sugar has split. It is 
more difficult to make jelly from an acid fruit. If the fruit is over- 
ripe, and an equal amount of sugar is used, crystals are formed, 
especially from grapes. 

The most satisfactory jelly test is that point at which the hot 
jelly forms a sheet, "jells," when dropped from a cold spoon. By 
this test there is no loss of time as in the usual one of cooling a 
small amount of hot jelly. If jelly is not thick enough when cold, 
put in the sun to harden; cover with panes of glass. 

To summprize: avoid over dilution of juice; avoid an over 
supply of sugar; avoid over cooking of juice and sugar. 

Crabapple, Quince, Japan Quince, Lady Blush 
Apples, Black Currants. 
These fruits will make a firm jelly with 1 part sugar to 2 parts 
fruit juice. Do not pare the fruit, but remove the seeds and cores; 
cover with cold water and boil 20 minutes; drain through a jelly 
bag and boil 10 minutes, add the sugar which has been heated, 
let it come to a boil and try immediately; if done, skim and pour 
in glasses. When pefectly cold, cover with paraffine or with paper 
dipped in white of egg. Keep in a dry place. 



298 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Grape, Blackberry, Raspberry, Currant, Strawberry. 

These fruits make jelly easily, and are treated in the same 
manner as the preceding, only that an equal amount of sugar is 
used, with 1 exception : Use 2 parts sugar to 3 parts juice for grapes. 



Plum. 

Use water sparingly for plums. 



Raspberry and Currant. 

A delicious jelly may be made by using equal parts of currants 
and raspberries, red or black. 



Strawberry Jelly. 

Fill jelly glass ^ full of sun-preserved strawberries free from 
the syrup. Then fill glass with hot currant jelly, stirring the straw- 
berries evenly through as mixture cools. 

— Mrs. S. N. Jones. 



Marbled Jelly. 

Put in the bottom of a jelly glass a layer of dark jelly (grape 
or plum), let it cool and harden, then put in carefully a layer of 
apple, then another dark layer, then one of light, as green grape. 
Every time jelly is made a layer may be put in a glass and covered 
till another kind is made. This makes a pretty garnish for meats 
or desserts. 



Cranberry Jelly. 

Add a cup of water to a quart of cranberries. Boil about 15 
minutes or until soft. Take off and press through a sieve. Put 
in a double boiler and stir in 1 pint of sugar and boil about 5 min- 
utes. Turn into molds to harden. Do not take out of mold till 
time to serve, as cranberry jelly does not stand long without be- 
ginning to melt. Do not have cranberries too ripe. 



JELLIES, CANNING, PRESERVES, PICKLES. 299 

CANNING. 



Rules. 

To insure success in canning fruits, two points must be ob- 
served: First, the fruit must be fresh and not over ripe. Second, 
the cans, tops, rubbers and all utensils used, must be thoroughly- 
sterilized with boiling water. 

Small Fruit. 
Prepare the fruit, add sugar to taste, put over a slow fire and 
bring to a boil; simmer a few moments, skim and can. Water may 
be added if more juice is desired. These fruits may be canned with 
perfect success without sugar and will better retain the flavor of 
the fresh fruit. Use a little water to prevent scorching. 



Large Fruit. 

For large fruits such as peaches, pears and plums make a syrup 
of 1 pound of sugar to 1 pint of water. Let it boil; skim, add the 
fruit, cook slowly till tender and seal. 



Another Method. 
Place a wooden or wire rack in a boiler. Fill the cans with 
fruit, lay the covers on loosely; place in the rack and put on cold 
water the depth of the rack. Let it boil 10 or 15 minutes. Mean- 
while prepare a rich syrup, putting in some of the fruit to flavor it. 
Take out the cans, fill them with the syrup, screw the covers on 
tight, replace in the boiler and boil till done. Small fruits should 
boil 15 minutes, large ones about 3^ hour. Let the cans remain in 
the boiler until cold. 



To Can Strawberries Without Cooking. 

Use nice firm berries (be sure they are not picked after a rain). 
Fill the cans, shaking them, down, pour over them boiling hot 
syrup in the proportion of 5 quarts of sugar to 2 quarts of water; 
seal. Place the cans in a deep receptacle and cover with boiling 
water. Let them stand in the water till cold. All kinds of fruit 
may be canned in this way. 

— Mrs. Murray Carpenter. 



300 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

To Can Strawberries, Cherries or Raspberries. 
Four quarts of fruit; 1 quart of sugar; 3 tablespoons water. 
Put in granite or porcelain pan with tight cover and cook in a hot 
oven 20 minutes. Do not uncover while cooking. The fruit will 
not shrink or change color. 

— Mrs. S. M. Gantz, Dixon, 111. 

Small Fruits, Canned Cold. 

Mash the fruit; add an equal amount of sugar; mix thoroughly 
until every particle of fruit is impregnated with sugar. Set on ice 
over night, then can in cold cans. This is used for small fruits. 

Peaches. 

Pare the peaches, remove the stones and drop the fruit into 
cold water to prevent discoloration. Prepare a syrup in the pro- 
portion of 2 quarts of water to 1 pound of sugar, boil until clear. 
Pack the fruit tightly in jars, then fill with the boiling syrup and 
seal at once. Set the jars in a wash boiler or tub, cover with boil- 
ing water, then place a lid or blanket over them and let stand till 
cold. 

To Can Vegetables. 

Tomatoes, asparagus, string beans, peas, beets and corn may 
be canned if cooked in the jars in which they are to be kept. As- 
paragus and beans should be cooked 15 minutes before putting 
into jars. Beets must be cooked 30 minutes, peel them and put into 
jars. Then fill the jars with cold water, adjust the rubbers, lay 
the covers on loosely, put the jars in a rack in the boiler, partly 
cover with cold water and boil 1 hour. Lift out the rack, screw the 
covers on tight, put back in the boiler, cover with boiling water 
and boil 30 minutes. 

Peas need not be cooked before putting into jars, but must be 
boiled 2 hours before and 30 minutes after screwing covers on. 
Corn should be cut or pressed from the cob and packed into jars, 
then boiled 23^ hours and finished as above. 

All vegetables should be canned the day they are picked and 
all utensils used must be sterilized. 

Tomatoes may be stewed in a kettle and put into cans. Pour 
boiling water over the tomatoes to remove the skins; cut into 
pieces, put into a granite or porcelain kettle and cook slowly 30 
minutes. 



JELLIES, CANNING, PRESERVES, PICKLES. 301 

PRESERVES. 



Preserved Fruit. 
Preserved fruits are those which are cooked in a thick syrup. 
Allow 1 pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. For large fruits 
prepare this syrup with the required amount of sugar dissolved 
in a little water. 

Conserves or Candied Fruit. 
Conserves or candied fruits are preserved fruits, dried. Pre- 
pare as above, and simmer gently until transparent; drain in a 
sieve, dust with sugar and dry in the sun or in a moderate oven. 
When it has lost its moisture roll in granulated sugar. Keep be- 
tween sheets of waxed paper. 



Strawberry Preserves. 
One quart of strawberries ;• 1 quart of sugar. Put strawber- 
ries in a porcelain or granite kettle and cook, without water, 20 
minutes over a slow fire, then add sugar and cook 5 minutes; put 
into jelly tumblers and when cold cover with paraffine and seal. 
It is best to cook only 1 quart at a time to prevent the fruit from 
breaking up. The berries remain^ whole and the preserve is rich 
and delicious. 

— Mrs. F. F. Wormw^ood. 

Sun-Preserved Strawberries. 
Use equal weight of fruit and sugar; put in a kettle and bring 
it almost to the boiling point. Remove from the fire and pour 
into big platters or plates. Cover each dish with a square of glass 
to keep out the flies and dust and to increase the heat; put in the 
sun for 10 or 12 hours till the fruit is transparent and the juice rich 
and thick; put into hot pint jars and seal. These are much better 
than strawberries prepared in any other way. Cherries, gooseber- 
ries and raspberries can be treated in the same way with as delic- 
ious results. 

— Mrs. Wm. S. Ives. 

Gooseberry Conserve I.

FIRELESS COOKERY. 317 



CHAPTER XXIV. 



FIRELESS COOKERY. 



"It is the bounty of nature that we live; but of philosophy 

that we live well." 

— Seneca 

There are on the market a number of cookers or patent de- 
vices for cooking without fire. These vary somewhat in detail; there 
is the lined box holding one or more empty pails; the same style 
of box with pails within pails or with wire supports inside; and the 
triple pail or kettle' arrangement simply made by placing the ket- 
tles one within the other and leaving the required space between 
each two. 

The enormous saving of fuel, labor and discomfort obtained 
by the process is a welcome boon to the busy housewife and with 
the added advantage that the flavor is retained to a much greater 
extent than possible by direct boiling. 

For one inexperienced in this method it is advisable to know 
the time required for the different foods before they are placed 
in the cooker. 

Food left indefinitely in the cooker will sour. All soups, vege- 
tables and such things must be removed in twenty-four hours and 
less in warm weather. 

Food which requires long cooking is improved if when the 
time is half up it is removed, without opening the pail, and reheated 
again before placing a second time in the cooker. 

Food should be placed in the box at once on removing from 
the fire, keeping the lid on tightly so that no steam escapes or the 
food will cool and cannot cook. 

Since this method of preparing food is still largely in an ex- 
perimental stage, the following time table may serve as a guide 
and be considered fairly accurate:

320 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

(For the cooker which has one pail within another, the outer one 

containing water.) 

Cereals. 

One cup of oatmeal, 3 cups of water. 

One cup cornmeal or rice, 4 cups of water. 

Bring the water in the outer pail to a boil. Put into the smaller 
pail the required water, let boil, add the meal and salt, let boil 10 
minutes. Place the smaller kettle within the larger, pack in the 
cooker, let stand all night. In the morning, reheat. 

Vegetables. 

Potatoes require 1 hour, if small. Dry in the oven later to 
make them mealy. 

Peas require 1 hour. 

Beets, squash, carrots, turnips need 3 hours and must be 
taken out when half done, reheated, the water reboiled in the 
outer pail and packed again in the cooker. 

Prepare the vegetables as usual, boil them for 5 minutes, 
place the smaller kettle in the outer one containing boiling water 
and put into the cooker. 

Baked Beans. 

Let the beans soak over night in cold water; in the morning 
drain, then add twice as much fresh water as there are beans; put 
in a piece of salt pork. Boil them 15 minutes, set the kettle into 
the larger one containing boiling water and pack in the cooker for 
3 hours. Remove, boil again and put in the cooker for 3 hours 
longer. Place into a baking dish and brown them in the oven. 
Add seasoning at the time of the second heating. 

Soups. 

Cut the meat into pieces, pour on cold water, add the vege- 
tables, season well, and boil about 15 minutes. Leave in the cooker 
all night. In the morning skim, strain and reheat. 

Boiled Fish. 

Tie the fish in a clean piece of cheese cloth, let simmer for 10 
minutes in boiling water, set the kettle in the outer pail of boiling 
water and pack for 3 hours. 



FIRELESS COOKERY. 321 

Boiled Meats. 
Beef Stew: Cut up the meat, put into hot fat and brown 
quickly. Add 1 cup of water to 2 cups of meat, season, boil 10 
minutes, put into the outer kettle of boiling water and pack for 2 
hours. Then reheat and cook 2 hours longer. 

Lamb Stew: Cut up meat, use 1 cup of water to 2 of meat, 
boil for 10 minutes, leave in the cooker for 2 hours. Remove, add 
tomato or chopped vegetables, and cook 2 or 3 hours more. 

Corned Beef: Place meat in cold water, let come to a boil 
and simmer 30 minutes. Set into the larger kettle of boiling water 
and put away for 5 hours. Remove the lid and put in the prepared 
vegetables under the meat. Reheat and again pack for 3 hours. 



Roast Meats. 
In a hot, dry frying pan, sear the meat all over. Bake for 20 
minutes in a very hot oven, adding 2 cups of water. Put the roast 
in small kettle, 'season and place in the large pail of boiling water. 
Cover both kettles tight and let boil rapidly for 10 minutes. Pack 
for 3 or 4 hours. Reheat the meat and thicken the gravy. Chicken 
is particularly good this way. 

(For the cooker containing separate and distinct receptacles.) 

Cereals. 

Use less water than ordinarily required, since there is no loss 
by evaporation caused by escaping steam. Boil for 5 minutes and 
while still bubbling, pack into the cooker. Oatmeal boiled 2 min- 
utes may be left in all night and reheated in the morning. Rice, 
tapioca and sago require 2 hours. 

Macaroni with Cheese: Boil 10 minutes in milk and water 
(half and half), salt, cover with grated cheese, pack for 13^ hours. 



Soups. 

Stock for soups easily prepared by boiling a soup-bone, chicken 
bones, etc., a few minutes and pack 2 hours. 

Put the meat in cold water, boil, remove scum, add vege- 
tables and boil for 15 minutes. Pack for 3 to 5 hours, according 
to size. 



322 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Stews. 
Beep and Mutton Stews: Brown first, boil for 20 minutes, 
season and pack about 3 hours, according to size, or may be left 
longer. 

Roasts. 

They should be browned in butter on all sides, then enough 
water poured on to come halfway up the sides, covered and allowed 
to cook ']/2 hour or so, then placed in the cooker 5 or 6 hours. They 
will not be crisp, but tender and juicy, and of fine flavor. 

(For the triple kettle cooker.) 

Another arrangement which does not require the box cooker 
and the results of which are delicious, is simplicity in itself. The 
recipes differ slightly from the preceding. 

Three kettles or enamel pails, fitting one within the other 
and leaving an inch space between each two are required. 

Place food to be cooked in the smallest kettle, add salt, but 
no water, except for dry cereals, which should be slightly moistened. 
Cover tightly. Place this in the next larger, which should contain 
about 3 inches of boiling water, put these 2 into the largest one, 
which should also hold about 4 inches of water. Put a large, 
tight-fitting lid over the whole and keep covered securely. Add 
a weight if necessary. Place the kettles over the fire and let boil 
rapidly for 5 minutes. Let stand until the food is cooked, depend- 
ing of course on the nature of the food. 

Meats require 3 or 4 hours. 

Vegetables require 2 hours. 

Cereals about 2 hours. 

The important point in cooking by this method is that the 
water be kept hot. This can be ascertained by feeling the outer 
kettle, and in no case remove the lid until food is done. In the 
case of meats and other things requiring long cooking, boil the 
water a second time for 5 or 10 minutes, say at the end of 2 hours. 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 323 



CHAPTER XXV. 

COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 

"Simple diet is best, for many dishes bring many diseases." 

— Pliny. 

It is of especial importance that the greatest pains should be 
taken in the preparation of the invalid's food. It should be served 
in the most attractive way, never sending more than an amount 
suflEicient for one meal. There may be a lack of desire for food, 
due merely to defective cooking, to the patient's dislike for a cer- 
tain food or to a meal presented at an inopportune moment. 

While it is unwise to ask the patient what he would like to 
eat, since the unexpected often pleases, yet it is desirable that 
there be frequent changes in order to tempt the appetite. 

Particular care should be exercised that the food selected be 
suitable to the patient's condition, as in the case of the very weak 
or fever patients when liquid food is more easily digested. 



Albuminized Orange. 
White of 1 egg; juice of 1 orange; sugar. Add the orange juice 
to the unbeaten white, sweeten and mix well. Strain and serve 
cold. 

Albuminized Sherry. 

White of 1 egg; 1 scant tablespoon Sherry; sugar. Beat the 
white to a stiff froth and while beating, add slowly the Sherry and 
sugar. Serve cold. 

Albuminized Grape Juice. 

Prepared the same as Sherry, using 2 tablespoons of juice to 
the white of 1 egg.

INVALID DISHES. 



Beef Juice. 

Select a thick cut of steak from the round or the rump and re- 
move all fat. Broil or heat long enough to start the juices, then 
extract the juice by means of a press or lemon squeezer. Season 
with salt and serve at once. Prepare only enough to serve, as it 
does not keep well. 

One pound of meat will yield about 5 ounces. Excellent, 
where solid foods cannot be taken. 



Beef Extract. 

One-half pound round steak; y^ pint cold water; cut beef fine, 
put in cold water; let it stand where it will keep warm for a couple 
of hours, heat as hot as possible without boiling; squeeze the juice 
from beef; salt to suit. 

— An Old Nurse. 

Beef Scraped. 

Take a small piece of tender steak and with a sharp knife 
scrape off all the pulp until there remains only the tough fibres. 
Season slightly with salt and pepper, form into small cakes and 
broil 2 minutes. Serve on toast. 



Beef Tea (Quickly Made). 

Select a steak from the top cut of the round, as this has less 
fat and more juice than other cuts; remove all fat and cut into 
small pieces. Put in dry pan over a slow fire and allow it to sweat 
for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. The meat 
will become white and surrounded by a rich gravy. It may be 
given, in cases of great exhaustion, in this form. 

For 1 pound of beef allow a pint of water. Pour the water 
over the meat and stir until it boils; afterwards let simmer slowly 
5 or 10 minutes, strain and remove any particle of fat on top with 
a piece of brown paper. Does not require seasoning. 

Beef Tea. 

Allow 1 cup of water to 3^ pound of steak. Remove each par- 
ticle of fat; cut into small pieces, pour on the water and let stand 
about 15 minutes. Put into a tightly covered glass jar and set it 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 325 

into a kettle of cold water. Bring the water slowly to the boiling 
point and let boil 2 hours. Strain and season with salt. Remove 
any fat on top with paper or bread. 

May be served hot, or is very grateful to a fever patient when 
ice cold. 

BROTH. 

Broth is the liquid containing the .juices of meat and bone, 
extracted by continued slow cooking. More nutriment is obtained 
from cheaper cuts than from the expensive parts. 

Best results are possible from the observation of the follow- 
ing rules: Cut meat into small pieces. Use cold water. Use steam- 
tight kettle, that there may be no waste by evaporation. If pos- 
sible, make the day before, when the fat may be more easily re- 
moved. Let simmer (not boil) until meat falls to pieces. In 
reheating, use double boiler. 

Mutton Broth. 

One quart of cold water to 1 pound of meat. Select the neck 
of mutton, remove skin and fat, cut into small pieces, pour on the 
water, let simmer until meat is in shreds. Remove fat and strain. 
Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot. One tablespoon of barley 
or rice (soaked over night) may be added if desired. Let barley 
simmer in the broth until the grains are tender. 

If possible, let broth stand all night, when the fat can be more 
easily removed. Excellent for those suffering from dysenteric 
troubles. 

Beef Broth. 

Prepared same as mutton broth. 

Veal Broth. 

Prepared same as mutton broth. 

Chicken Broth I. 

Same as mutton broth. 

Chicken Broth II. 

Cut a chicken into small pieces, lay it in a deep earthen dish, 
add a quart of cold water and set it over a boiling kettle; cover 
closely and let it steam several hours, until the meat is very tender; 



326 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

strain off the broth and let it stand over night; in the morning skim 
off carefully all the fat, and pour out the broth into the bowl; into 
the deep dish ' put 3^ of a cupful of rice in a cupful of cold water 
and steam as before until the rice is soft; pour in the broth and 
steam an hour or 2 longer; season to the taste of the invalid and 
serve hot. This is easily digested and very delicious. 

Oyster Broth. 
One cup chopped oysters; 1 cup cold water; 3^ cup hot milk; 
salt and pepper to taste; 1 Boston cracker, rolled fine. Put the 
oysters in the water, let them stand where they will slowly come 
to a boil, then strain in the milk; add the rolled crackers, salt and 
pepper. 

Chicken Broth Jelly. 
A 5-pound fowl should be prepared as for chicken broth. Let 
simmer 12 hours, strain while hot through a fine sieve, and season. 
Let cool on ice for 12 hours and remove fat. May be used full 
strength or diluted with water. 

Chicken Feet (for Jelly or Broth). 
Procure chickens' feet, cut off nails, pour over boiling water, 
let stand a few minutes and skim. Boil until they fall to pieces. 
Jelly or broth made from the feet, which is considered, according 
to a trained nurse, the most nutritious part of the fowl, is unsur- 
passed for invalids. 

Mutton Broth Jelly. 
Prepared the same as chicken broth jelly. 

Chicken Panada. 

Take a breast of cold chicken, put in a marble mortar and 
pound to a paste with a little of the broth (or chop very fine and 
add chicken broth). Season with salt and heat slowly to required 
consistency. It should be such as you can drink, though quite 
thick, or may be served with toast. 

Chicken Toast. 

Two tablespoons cold chicken, chopped fine; boil in sufficient 
water to make a cupful of the whole, thicken slightly with corn- 
starch in melted butter, pour over a slice of nicely toasted bread 
and serve hot. 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 327 

Caudle. 

Two tablespoons oatmeal; 1 quart water; butter, sugar, nut- 
meg, brandy or wine; 1 cup raisins; salt. Boil raisins in the water 
rapidly for ^ hour. Mix oatmeal with water to a smooth paste; 
add salt. After raisins have boiled enough, add oatmeal thicken- 
ing, let boil and skim well. Add sugar, butter, nutmeg, brandy 
or wine to taste when served. 



Cocoanut Milk or Cream. 

One cup grated cocoanut to 1 cup hot water. Select a cocoanut 
with plenty of water in it; clean and grate, discarding the water. 
To 1 cup of the grated nut add 1 cup of hot water, let stand a few 
minutes, strain through a thick cloth and squeeze well. This 
yields a thick cream. For cocoanut milk add more hot water to 
the pulp, squeeze and strain again. Use while fresh. Is delicious 
with fruit and will not curdle. This milk is excellent for children 
and invalids who cannot use cow's milk. 



Egg-Nog. 

Break a fresh egg into a tumbler, add a heaping teaspoon 
sugar, beat very light, and fill up the tumbler with milk. A small 
glass of wine may be added or a little nutmeg. 

Where an invalid is required to take a raw egg daily, an egg-nog 
may be rendered more palatable by a variation in flavor. Add 
fruit juices to the beaten egg and sweeten. Never use milk with 
the fruit juice, but dilute with water. Raspberry, pineapple and 
orange are excellent. 

While egg-nog is extensively prescribed and very* nutritious, 
there are cases where the combination is apt to produce nausea in 
a feeble stomach, especially in fever; consequently whole eggs are 
unfit for fever patients, and only the whites used. 



Egg Lemonade. 

Two eggs; sugar as desired; juice of 1 large lemon; 1 cup snow 
or pounded ice; put the yolks, sugar and lemon juice together, 
beat them well and add the well beaten whites of the eggs with 
the snow or ice; beat the whole well together and add water enough 
to make a pint; drink through a glass tube. 



328 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Egg Nests. 
Separate an egg, beat the white until stiff, add a little salt, 
put into a large cup and in center drop the unbroken yolk. Place 
in pan of hot water, let boil until white of egg is set. May also be 
placed on buttered rounds of toast and put in oven 3 minutes. 

WITH RICE. 

Butter a glass, line with boiled rice, put in the stiffly beaten 
white and in the center place the yolk. Put in oven long enough 
to set the white. 

Eggs and Rum (Milk Punch). 
One cup fresh milk; 1 tablespoon sugar; yolk 1 egg; 1 table- 
spoon rum; pinch salt; little nutmeg. Beat yolk, add sugar, nut- 
meg and salt; then add milk and rum. Taken by consumptives, 
early in the morning, often prevents the exhausting morning sweats. 

Egg Gruel. 

Boil eggs until hard enough to grate. Scald milk, add grated 
egg to the hot milk and season with salt. Excellent, if patient is 
nauseated. 

Flour Gruel. 

One cup miilk; 3^ tablespoon flour; 1 dozen seeded raisins; 
pinch salt. Scald the milk and stir in the flour which has been 
mixed with a little cold milk. Cook 3^ hour in double boiler. Cut 
the raisins in small pieces and with enough water to cover, cook 
slowly until the water has boiled away. Season the gruel and add 
raisins. This is slightly astringent. May be prepared without the 
raisins, which should never be used in cases of bowel troubles. 

Barley Gruel. 

Two tablespoons barley flour; 1 quart scalded milk; salt. 
Mix the barley flour with a little cold milk and stir it into the 
scalding milk. Cook 2 hours in a double boiler. Season to taste, 
and sweeten, if desired. Strain. 

Barley Gruel with Broth. 
Two cups beef broth; 2 tablespoons barley flour; 2 tablespoons 
cold water; 1 saltspoon salt. Mix the flour and the water to a 
smooth paste, add salt, pour slowly into the boiling broth and let 
boil 3^ hour. Strain and serve hot. 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 329

Two teaspoons arrowroot; 2 tablespoons cold water; sugar, 
wine, brandy or lemon juice, as desired; 1 cup boiling water or milk; 
salt. Mix the arrowroot and water to a paste. Pour into the boil- 
ing water or milk. Cook for 2 hours in a double boiler. 

Season, strain and serve hot. Beneficial in diarrhoea cases. 

Indian Meal Gruel. 

One tablespoon Indian meal; 2 tablespoons cold water; 3^ 
pint boiling water; salt; nutmeg; sugar, if desired. Mix to a smooth 
paste meal, salt and cold water. Stir slowly into the boiling water. 
Let simmer 13^ hours. Strain. May be diluted with milk or cream. 

Rice Gruel. 
Prepared same as Indian meal gruel, using 1 quart boiling 
water.

(Good to use in typhoid fever cases). One cup well cooked 
oatmeal, while hot add 1 cup milk, 1 cup hot water; beat together 
thoroughly, strain through wire strainer; add salt, if desired. 

Oatmeal Gruel II. 

Take Yi cup of oatmeal, pound in a mortar until mealy (or 
rub hard with a little cold water). Put it into a glass, stir well and 
pour off the milky water into a sauce pan. Again fill the glass, 
pour off and repeat as long as water looks mealy. Set sauce pan 
where it will simmer for 1 hour (in double boiler 2 hours). Strain. 
Season with salt, add sugar, if desired. Thin with milk, if too thick. 

Dried or Boiled Flour Gruel. 

Tie y^ cupful of flour in bag and boil about 3 hours. Take out, 
dry in the sun or oven until it is hard. Grate it when needed, us- 
ing 1 tablespoon to a pint of milk, and stir over the fire until it 
comes to a boil. Add salt, a little cold water and serve. Especially 
good for children afflicted with summer complaint. 

Barley Jelly. 

Three tablespoons pearl barley; salt; 1 quart water. Soak the 
barley over night, strain, pour on a- quart of water, add salt and 



330 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

boil 4 hours in a double boiler. Strain through a cloth. Thin the 
jelly when cold with warm and sweetened milk, in the proportion 
of the tablespoons of jelly to 1 cup of milk. 



Rice Jelly. 

One and one-half tablespoons rice; % cup milk; salt. Wash 
the rice and let stand in cold water about 2 hours. Drain, add milk 
and cook for 13^ hours in a double boiler. Strain, add salt, let stand 
until cold and serve with sugar and cream or fruit juices. 



Tapioca Jelly. 

One teacup pearl tapioca; 1 quart cold water; pinch of salt; 
lemon juice or wine. Thoroughly wash the tapioca and pour over 
it the quart of cold water. Let soak 3 or 4 hours and simmer until 
it becomes quite clear, stirring often. Serve hot with cream, sugar 
and wine, or while hot, add lemon juice and chill. 



Cracker Panada. 

Three or 4 crackers; 1 quart water; sugar; salt. Break the 
crackers into pieces and bake brown. Boil 15 minutes in the quart 
of water and let stand 3 or 4 minutes. Strain through a fine wire 
sieve, add salt and a little sugar. 

For infants that are teething this is a nourishing beverage and 
for invalids recovering from a fever is often prescribed with the 
addition of a little wine and nutmeg. 

Flaxseed Tea. 

One tablespoon whole flaxseed; sugar; 2 cups cold water; 
juice 1 lemon. Thoroughly wash flaxseed. Put into sauce pan, 
add cold water and let simmer 1 hour. Add lemon juice and

cases accompanied by a cough. 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. 331 

Toast Water. 

Toast bread as brown as possible without burning. Cover with 
boiling water and season with salt. Let stand about 1 hour and 
strain through cheese cloth. Serve hot or cold. May be flavored 
with orange or lemon peel or a glass of white wine added and 
grated nutmeg. Valuable in cases of fever or extreme nausea. 



Hop Tea. 
Take 1 large spoonful of hops, add 1 pint of cold water, let 
simmer. When sufficiently strong, strain, sweeten and add a 
tablespoon of gin. This is a quieting drink and most excellent for 
a nervous headache. 



RECIPES FOR THE BABY. 

"No particular diet can be recommended for the infant that 
is so unfortunate as to be deprived of its natural nourishment. 
What agrees with one is quite unsuccessful with another. Differ- 
ent kinds of diet can only be tested. Children's little illnesses are 
often the result of food which, in their case, is unassimilating and 
indigestible, and it is often better to attempt a change of food 
than to resort to medicines." 

— Mrs. Henderson. 

Some babies have strong digestive organs and thrive on cow's 
milk straight and undiluted. Some require it to be diluted with 
}/^ water and some require lime water in addition. Some babies 
thrive well on goat's milk when they can take no other. It is al- 
ways safer to consult the physician, but many of them are able only 
to experiment and succeed in finding the right food only after re- 
peated failures. Whey seems to be the almost absolutely unfailing 
diet, mixed with cream or top milk when everything else fails. 
The amount of cream or milk to use with whey should always be 
prescribed by the physician. 



Baby Food. 

Junket tablets are especially valuable in preparing food for 
infants as a means of modifying milk. They are handy in prepar- 
ing whey and are an aid to digestion in any preparation of milk 
or cream. 



332 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Mrs. Rorer's Recipe for Preparing Infant Food. 

Where cow's milk, even when diluted, or partly modified, as 
in the home fashion, disagrees with the infant, this mixture may 
be used with good results: Heat 2 quarts of milk to 100 degrees F. 
Add 2 of Chr. Hansen's junket tablets dissolved in a tablespoonful 
of cold water. When the milk is congealed and perfectly solid 
draw through it backwards and forwards an ordinary four-tined 
silver fork; this will separate the curd. Strain through 2 thick- 
nesses of cheese cloth, saving the whey as this is the part you are 
to use; add a pint of water, a half ounce of sugar of milk, 3 ounces 
of cream and 4 ounces of the white of egg. The whites may be 
dropped into a quart fruit jar, a pint of the whey added, the top 
screwed on and the jar thoroughly shaken until the whites are well 
mixed with the whey; then add them to the remaining quantity, 
and stand at once in a very cold place. This will be given in quan- 
tities of from 2 to 3 ounces in an ordinary nursing bottle. This 
albuminized whey forms one of the most easily digested and valued 
of all foods for convalescing patients. With the cream and sugar 
of milk omitted, it may be used successfully in typhoid and kindred 
fevers. 

Whey. 

To prepare whey temper fresh milk until luke warm, 85 de- 
grees to 100 degrees F; to each quart add 1 junket tablet dis- 
solved in cold water and stir it in quickly. Leave the milk at rest 
in a warm place 15 minutes or until firmly thickened. When per- 
fectly firm, put into cheese cloth and drain off the whey. As the 
butter fat is retained in the curd, and does not go into the whey, 
skimmed milk will answer the purpose as well as new milk. But 
whether new or skimmed, the milk must be perfectly fresh, as 
otherwise the whey is apt to be sour. Cool immediately when the 
whey has drained from the curd. Use quickly or keep in the re- 
frigerator. Whey may be considered mildly nutritive and very 
wholesome; if fresh it is readily assimilated by the stomach, requir- 
ing no labor to fit it for absorption, and contains in a degree every 
element of nutrition. Whey is strongly recommended as a most 
satisfactory food in- case of cholera infantum and is far more suit- 
able than any other food preparation as a temporary substitute 
for milk. For adult invalids whey is a most pleasing and nutritious 
drink. 



COOKERY FOR INVALIDS. " 333 

Cream and Whey Mixture. 

One ounce of cream; 7 ounces of whey; 2 tablespoons milk 
sugar. The amount of cream will have to be varied with the age 
and needs of the child, and should be recommended by the physi- 
cian. 

— Crozier Griffith. 

Barley Water. 

Boil \}/2 tablespoons of whole barley in water for 5 minutes, 
drain off the water and throw it away, then add to the barley 1 
quart of water and cook or simmer it slowly down to 1 pint. Re- 
move from stove and strain. It is a substitute for milk in sickness. 



Albumen Water. 

Dissolve slowly the raw white of 1 egg in a glass of cold water. 
Strain it only if necessary to prevent clogging the rubber nipple. 
Sweeten, if desired, and warm it only slightly before giving. This 
is good as a temporary nourishment when milk cannot be taken. 

— Crozier Griffith. 

Beef Juice. 

Take 1 pound of round or tenderloin steak (free from fat), 
season with salt and sear over in a hot skillet or broil slightly. 
Then cut it into small pieces and squeeze out the juice with a fruit 
press or lemon squeezer. It may be given cold or warmed slightly. 
It may be sweetened a little. 

Sterilized Milk. 

Fill small necked 3^ pint bottles to within \}/2 inches of the 
top with milk. Cork with absorbent cotton. Stand in a steamer 
of cold water, having the water to surround bottles to % their 
height. Heat the water gradually until nearly to boiling point and 
keep at this temperature for 10 minutes. When used for infants, 
allow from a teaspoon to a tablespoon for each bottle of milk. 

— Boston Cooking School Cook Book. 



How to Prepare Plain Junket. 

Drop 1 junket tablet and a tablespoon of cold water into a cup 
and crush with a spoon to dissolve thoroughly. Heat 1 quart of 
pure milk until luke-warm, about 98 degrees F. — no more; add 



334 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

sugar and flavor to taste and, if desired, a trifle of 1 of the junket 
colors. Add the dissolved junket tablet to the luke-warm milk and 
stir it in quickly. Pour into junket glasses or saucers, or into a 
large dish. Let stand undisturbed in a warm room until firm. Re- 
move carefully, without shaking, to a cold place or the refrigerator 
and let stand until time to serve. Serve with or without cream. 



Junket for Children. 

Prepare as for plain junket; pour into a large pudding dish in- 
stead of individual junket glasses; dish carefully in serving so as 
not to break the jelly too much. If preferred, it can be made with- 
out sweetening or flavor and served with sugar and grated nutmeg 
or cinnamon sprinkled over it. Children will often eat a quantity 
of this delicious dish, and may be allowed it, as it is very nutritious 
as well as inexpensive. Milk being the one perfect food for infants, 
it becomes, when made into junket, the ideal health food for grow- 
ing children. No other food contains so much true nourishment 

in proper proportion, or is so easily digested. 

— Miss Crane.

The Spengler Cooker 

or Heat Distributor is an appliance which placed over one burner 
of a Gas — Gasoline— Alcohol or Blue Flame Oil Stove positively 
cooks, not merely keeps warm, three articles in three separate good 
sized, regular Utensils with but One Gas Flame. One flame instead 
of three means gross saving 66 2-3 per cent, gis consumed. 

A liberal allowance for slight excess time to start things boil- 
ing, over direct flame method, privileges us to state, without fear 
of honest contradiction, that each and every housewife who uses 
the SPENGLER COOKER will positively reduce her bill for cook- 
ing by Gas over 50 per cent. Does it appeal to you? 

REMEMBER 

besides cutting your "Cooking by gas" 
bills in half The Spengler Cooker posi- 
tively avoids the chance of scorching 
cereals, soups and milk. 

You can well afford to "buy" for 
this reason alone. No contact with 
the direct flame solves this problem. 
For the very same reason your 
Enameled and other cooking ware will last until worn out. The 
"old way" on direct flame, "Burns it up in no time."

HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 337 



CHAPTER XXVI. 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 



"Little drops of knowledge,- 

Little grains of sense 
Solve the mighty problem 
. Of the home expense." 



Cooking Hints. 

When making gravy, remove the pan from the fire while the 
thickening is being stirred in, and when smooth return to the fire 
to cook. This will prevent lumps forming. Cook at least 10 min- 
utes longer to cook the flour. 

Add a httle sugar when making pie crust to make it crisp and 
brown. 

If you put a piece of horseradish root into a jar of pickles, the 
vinegar will retain its strength longer and the pickles will be less 
likely to become soft and mold. 

To keep potatoes warm after pouring off the water and shak- 
ing, cover the potatoes with a folded towel. 

When vegetables such as parsnips, carrots, string beans, etc., 
are boiling, drop in a pinch of soda; pour off the water and replace 
with boiling water. Will make the vegetables more tender. 

Washing and Ironing. 

If a few drops of glycerine be added to the starch for linens, 
it will be found that the iron will not stick and the linen will have 
a beautiful gloss after being ironed. 

Rusty flatirons should be rubbed over with beeswax and lard 
or beeswax and salt. 

Fine laces and sheer handkerchiefs may be laundered like new 
without being ironed. Wash in suds by squeezing in the hands. 
Rinse, and if desired, dip in a thin starch. Have the inside of a 



338 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

window pane perfectly clean and spread articles out on the glass, 
smoothing out every wrinkle. It will stick to the glass and dry 
in a short time. Fine lace work should never be ironed. 

When starching black wash dresses and petticoats add bluing 
enough to make the starch a deep blue. 

If the button side of waists is ironed in a folded bath towel, 
buttons turned downward, they will be prevented from breaking 
and are more easily ironed. 

If cloth is scorched when ironing, dip immediately in hot 
water. 

Stains — To Remove Stains From White Cloth. 

Fruit stains: Pour on boiling hot water. 

Cocoa and blood stains: Soak in cold water. 

Ink stains: Rub spot with salt, then wet with ammonia. 

Grass stains: Rub with butter or molasses. 

Car grease: Rub with laundry soap and wash in kerosene. 

Ink stains from fountain pen and iron rust: Rub with lemon 
juice, sprinkle with salt, then lay in the sun. 

Paint stains: Rub with turpentine or benzine. 

Coffee stains : Rub with glycerine. 

Alcohol will remove candle grease. 

If you should accidentally sit on sticky fly paper, apply gaso- 
line. 

Rub grease stains on hard wood floors with soda. 

Rub spoons with common salt to remove egg stains. 

Rub mildew marks over with a piece of raw tomato. Sprinkle 
with salt and lay in the sun. Repeat the process, if necessary. 



Vermin. 

For moths, dissolve 14, pound gum camphor in 13^ gallon of 
benzine and use freely with an atomizer. 

Oil of red cedar is good to drive away mosquitoes, moths and 
ants. Soak in wads of cotton. 

To keep ants out of a refrigerator, fill baking powder can covers 
with water and place under castors. Cut a piece of newspaper a Httle 
larger than bottom of your sugar crock and place on a sheet of 
sticky fly paper. Put your crock on this and your sugar will be 
free from ants. 

A small quantity of green sage placed in the pantry will keep 
out red ants. 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 339 

Fill rat holes with laundry soap or cayenne pepper. 

Allspice freely used will kill buffalo bugs. 

This ant remedy is guaranteed to succeed when all others fail. 
Mix 1 teaspoon tartar emetic, 1 teaspoon sugar with ^ cupful of 
water, put in saucers and set saucers around in the cupboard. 

Remedies. 

The juice of 3^ a lemon squeezed into a glass of water, taken 
in the morning without sugar, is a simple remedy for torpid liver. 

Lemon juice mixed very thickly with sugar will relieve a tick- 
ling cough. 

For sore throat, gargle with 1 part alcohol and 3 parts water. 

Dip a woolen cloth in alcohol, wring out, and place on the 
chest to relieve croup. 

Keep on hand Hydrogen Peroxide for cuts, and Carbolated 
vaseline for bruises. 

Rubbing bruises after applying ointment will prevent swelling. 

Soaking feet in hot water and salt relieves tired nerves. 

For chilblains, rub the parts affected with brandy and salt. 

The raw white of an egg applied to a burn will take out heat. 

Ammonia applied to the bites of insects, such as fleas, mos- 
quitoes, etc., will stop the itching at once. 

One tablespoonful of olive oil after each meal will increase 
the flesh. 

Miscellaneous. 

Turpentine mixed with stove polish prevents rust and gives a 
brighter gloss than the use of water. 

In packing white lace or white silk waists or gowns_ if you 
wish them to remain perfectly white, wrap in light blue cheese- 
cloth or tissue paper and place in a box. 

If you have no ice and want to cool hot water in a short time, 
put the water in an air-tight jar and place under cold running 
water. It will be ice cold in 20 minutes. 

A large case, similar to a pillow case, made of unbleached cot- 
ton, for mattresses that can be taken off and washed, saves much 
time in cleaning them. 

To make false hair puffs, switches and pompadours look like

Use a clothespin instead of a stick, when stringing nastur- 
tiums or sweet peas. 

Save broken gas mantles. They make fine silver polish. 

If blankets are too short during the cold weather, sew a piece 
of canton flannel to one end for the "tuck in." 

To remove adhesive plaster, wet with alcohol. 

A mustard plaster mixed entirely with white of egg will neither 
scar nor blister. 

To color curtains ecru, buy a little yellow ochre. Pour boil- 
ing water on the ochre and mix in starch. 

Use kerosene in water to clean window glass and painted 
woodwork. 

Use a little ammonia or alcohol in the water to clean glass of 
pictures, etc. 

Place a thimble or the finger of an old glove on the end of the 
curtain rod when running it through a freshly starched curtain. 

To keep a broom firm, before using it soak in boiling hot water

THE HOT BEDS AND COLD FRAMES OF A KITCHEN GARDEN. 341 



CHAPTER XXVII 



THE HOTBEDS AND COLD FRAMES 
OF A KITCHEN GARDEN 



"Who loves the Garden loves the Greenhouse, too." 

— Cooper. 



The kitchen garden is the housewife's constant friend, so why 
not make an effort to begin early with a hotbed and a little later 
with a cold frame, thus securing the delicious young vegetables 
ahead of the markets and our neighbors, provided they are not as 
thrifty as we? Think of the pleasure of taking them some crisp 
heads of lettuce, some tender radishes, or some juicy rhubarb for 
their Christmas dinner. With the hotbed this is made quite pos- 
sible. 

The hotbed may be started about December first, and for the 
benefit of our friends who have had no experience in this mode of 
gardening, we will give a few dimensions and suggestions for mak- 
ing, culled from "The Garden Magazine." 

First, choose a spot having a southern exposure, well pro- 
tected from the north and west winds, and where the natural 
drainage is away from the bed. 

Dig out a space the size of frame so that when the frame is set 
up the interior space is four feet deep. Posts 2x4 set firmly in each 
corner and at intervals on each side serve as supports for the frame. 

The dimensions of a practical frame are 9 ft. 2 in x 5 ft. 6 in., 
2 feet high in the rear and 18 inches high in front. Two strips 
across the top serve as rests for the sash, which in buying the com- 
mercial size (3x6), requires three. Now for the bed. The heating 
material is composed of fresh horse manure about 3 feet in depth. 
Drench well with water, then close frame for a few days in order 
to heat thoroughly. After this process the soil (which is equal 
parts of good sifted garden loam and well rotted manure) is thrown 



342 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

in to the depth of 4 or 5 inches. The frame must be well protected 
on the outside from frosts and cold weather by banking with ma- 
nure and straw. 

The temperature during ordinary weather should be from 50 
to 60 degrees, but in cold or stormy weather the glass should be 
covered with burlap, matting or straw. Should the temperature 
rise to 85 degrees or more, this must be regulated by raising the 
sash a little with small blocks of wood kept for that purpose. A 
general rule to follow is, open the sash on pleasant mornings about 
an hour after sunrise, and close 1 or 2 hours before sundown. On 
cold, stormy days it is best to let the bed alone. 

After planting seeds, sprinkle with luke warm water along the 
rows; keep moist, but not wet. Lettuce, radishes, onions, carrots, 
spinach, parsley, rhubarb and asparagus should be put in first and 
planted in succession in order to keep the table supplied. 

The cold frames are generally used later. Transplanting the 
plants from the hotbed, cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, melons, 
cucumbers, etc., are started ready for garden transplanting, or left 
in cold frames to mature, provided there is space enough. 

The cold frames are not made with as much heating material 
as the hotbed — a good rich loam will answer the purpose. An ex- 
cellent article on how to manage a cold frame is given in the March 
1907 number of "The Garden Magazine," to which we refer any 
interested, as lack of space forbids more on this subject. 

Rhubarb can be forced any time after December 1st in the 
hotbed or warm cellar where the light and heat are good. The 
roots should be slightly frozen before taken up. Bring in and 
place on the cellar floor covered until thawed out; they are then 
ready for planting. If not planted in the hotbed, plant in good 
rich soil in boxes, using broken crocks or cinders for drainage, and 
cover the tops with about 3 or 4 inches of soil. Care must be taken 
not to water the leaves, yet keep the ground moist. The temper- 
ature required is only 50 or 60 degrees. With care, there might 
be a rhubarb pie for the New Year's dinner. 

March is the month to think of the outdoor garden, also plant- 
ing of seeds in the hotbed for this garden when all danger of frosts 
is over. Tomatoes, eggplants, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, pep- 
pers, even cucumbers and melons may thus be given an early start, 
which enables one to have many good vegetables before summer 
droughts deprive us of much, and cause us to think it was love's 
labor lost. 



THE HOTBEDS AND COLD FRAMES OF A KITCHEN GARDEN. 343 

However, it is worth trying for the joy it brings in; the early 
season fully compensates us for later losses, when the rains will 
not descend to warrant plenty of vegetables for the winter. 



THE KITCHEN GARDEN. 



"Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted; 
Suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden, 
And choke the herbs for the want of husbandry." 

— Shakespeare. 



How eagerly we look forward to the first green stuff from the 
garden in the spring! While the radishes, onions, lettuce, spinach, 
etc., are still in the hotbeds safe from frosts, up comes the hardy 
rhubarb and asparagus in defiance of the hoary King. How hard 
it is to have 1,00.0 asparagus plants, and have to wait until the 
third year before you can cut all you want of it! Next comes the 
juicy onion sets, and the greens in quick succession, and berry 
time has arrived. That means a celebration, for the strawberries 
out of our own patch are always the sweetest we ever ate. Then 
comes the peas, and beans and tomatoes and golden August brings 
the sweet corn, when there are corn roasts and corn is dried for 
winter. September brings the melons! There's a wrenching of 
the heart and stomach if one has to be away in melon time! Then 
the grapes have to be eaten and canned and made into grape juice, 
jellies, etc. Now comes a hint of frost and everything is gathered 
into the big cellar and stored for future use. 

So in seed time and harvest, all through the cycle of the 
months we are continually reminded of the useful kitchen garden. 

Vegetables are divided into several different classes. 

Under pot herbs or greens comes: Asparagus, cabbage, cauli- 
flower, brussels sprouts, swiss chard, spinach, beet, kale, mustard, 
dandelions. 

The sweet herbs are: Summer and winter savory, thyme, sage, 
mint, parsley, tarragon, sweet marjoram. 

The salad plants are: Lettuce, radish, celery, water cress, 
pepper grass, curled cress, endive, dandelion, corn salad, chicory, 
cardoon, borage, garden sorrel, chives and mustard. 



344 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

The seeds and fruits are: Peas, corn, cucumbers, egg plant, 
okra, musk melon, watermelon, pepper, pumpkin, squash and 
tomato. 

The vegetable roots which can be stored for winter are : Beets, 
carrots, celeraic, horseradish, Jerusalem artichokes, kohlrabi, pars- 
nips, potatoes, rutabagas, salsify, scolymus, scorzonera, white 
turnips, winter radish, leeks, onions and garlic. 

The garden would not be complete without: Strawberries, 
raspberries, blackberries, currants, gooseberries, and grapes. 

The flavor of kale is improved by freezing. 

Scorzonera much resembles salsify and the roots are prepared 
and eaten exactly the same way. 

Celeriac is a variety of celery that has edible roots instead of 
leaves. It is used for soups, stews and salads. 

The leaf of borage is used in any way in which cucumber is 
used as a flavoring, for the taste is identical. 

Endive, when well grown, must be tied up on a dry day, so 
the hearts will be blanched. 

When cutting sweet herbs for drying, the leaves must be 
picked just before blossoming time and when the sun is shining. 

Brussels sprouts should be started in the hotbed and set out 
later, for frosts often kill them before they have matured. They 
require 150 days. 

Sow corn salad out doors in September, cover lightly with lit- 
ter, and you will have a salad from the garden in March or before 
snow melts. 

Mustard is a welcome salad in late fall and can be raised from 
seed sown in August. Mustard for salad is ready in 10 days; for 
greens, about 30 days. 

Spraying with ice cold water and protecting from sun will 
nearly always save a slightly frozen plant. 

We are indebted to the Garden Magazine for our information.

TABLE ETIQUETTE AND MENUS. 34' 



CHAPTER XXVIII. 



TABLE ETIQUETTE AND MENUS 



'The true essentials of a feast are only fun and feed." 

— Holmes. 



SETTING THE TABLE. 

In setting the table let this rule be followed first, last and all 
the time — have the table linen spotlessly white and of the finest 
quality that you can possibly afford to buy. The chief charm of any 
table lies in its neatness and daintiness. It is much better economy 
to buy firm, fine, thick table linen even if the cost is higher, than 
to buy the coarse, loosely woven, thin linens as the latter do not 
wear nearly as long. Always use a thick table pad of material 
which comes for this purpose (the thicker the better) under the 
tablecloth. This pad should extend 3 or 4 inches over the table 
all around as it thus prevents the tablecloth from wearing out 
where the edge of the table comes. This pad is called a "silencer" 
as it deadens the noise and makes a more refined table. It also 
protects a handsome polished wood table. Table linen should not 
be starched. For the family alone, have the table as spotless as 
for company. Generally it is only at meal time that the entire 
family is assembled together, and the refining influence of home 
can be taught in no surer or better way than by neatness and dainti- 
ness of table and cheerfulness and good manners at table. Leave 
all care, worry and anger outside of the dining room. This should 
be the happiest place in the home, as it is the most necessary. Be 
perfect in table deportment always. I would say to young parents 
that one of the most important lessons which they should teach 
their children is perfect table manners, and to require of them al- 
ways to be particular even when only the family is present, then 
when company comes there will be no fear that Johnnie will stick 
his fingers in the pickle dish or that Susie will take her pie up in 
her hand to eat. The handling of the knife and fork when using 



348 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

and the proper placing of them on the plate when through, stamp 
the seal of early training and good breeding wherever it is seen. It 
is said that the Empress Eugenie of France was so punctilious 
about table etiquette that she never invited a gentleman a second 
time to dine who more than half unfolded his napkin or placed it 
other than over his left knee. 

Square, oblong or round tables are used, but the latter lend 
themselves better for effects in table decorations and show off a 
good dinner to the best advantage. A round table top of pine, 
hinged in the center so as to fold when not in use, is very conven- 
ient to place on the dining table to enlarge it. A top measuring 7 
feet in diameter will seat 12 people, the rule being to allow 20 in- 
ches to a person. It is good form to use either a round or square 
tablecloth for a round table. 

The service plate, knives, forks, spoons, glasses and napkin 
for each guest constitute the Cover. The service plate should be 
the handsomest plate you have and should be 10 inches in diame- 
ter. It is placed on the table before dinner is announced, and is 
left on until the meat course. Although the dernier cri concern- 
ing this plate is that it be left on the table through the dinner until 
the dessert. It is good form to do either. On the right of the serv- 
ice plate place one, two or three knives as may be required for fish, 
meat and game, with the sharp edge toward the plate and in the 
order in which they will be used, beginning at the outside. At the 
right of the knives place the soup or bouillon spoon and at its right 
the small fork for oysters or canapes. The forks should be placed 
at the left of the service plate with the ice cream or dessert fork 
next to the plate, then the salad fork, game fork, large fork for the 
roast and the fish fork at the extreme left. Place spoons for sher- 
bet and coffee above the service plate. If a spoon is used for ice 
cream or dessert instead of a fork, place it above the plate. Above 
and at the right of the plate place the goblet for water and arrange 
wine glasses just beside and a little back of the goblet. If there 
is room^ place the napkin at the left of the forks with a roll, or thick 
piece of bread cut narrow and with the crust removed, between 
the folds. If there is not room, place it upon the service plate. 
Dinner cards containing the name of the guest should be laid upon 
the napkin. Individual dishes for salted nuts should be filled and 
placed above the forks at the left of the service plate. 

Dinner cards may be decorated in any dainty way to match 
the general scheme of decoration, but those most used at present 
are plain white cards with the monogram or crest of the hostess 



TABLE ETIQUETTE AND MENUS. 349 

in gold at the top. Menu cards are seldom, if ever used, at private 
tables now. If one has pretty little dishes of silver or Venetian 
glass they may be filled with salted nuts, and candy or confections, 
generally tinted the color of the decorations and placed on the table. 
Butter plates are not used for dinners. Finger bowls are not used 
as much as formerly. When used, they should be put on a small 
plate on which has been placed a dainty doily. They should be 
half filled with water on top of which floats a geranium leaf or a 
sprig of lemon verbena as these leave a pleasant odor on the fingers. 
Never require two guests to use the same finger bowl. Extreme 
simplicity combined with artistic effect is the rule at present for 
table decorations except for special occasions when one can let 
their fancy run riot as it is understood by the guests that it is for 
the occasion only. The day of profuse use of ribbons has gone by. 
Flowers, ferns, fruits or softly shaded candles together with spark- 
hng glass, shining silver and snowy linen makes a beautiful, 
aesthetic picture. Flowers may cost more than their weight in 
gold if orchids are used, or they may be plucked in the woods or 
by the wayside and be equally beautiful and attractive. Thirty- 
six guests at a charming breakfast party were seated at round tables 
in three different rooms. One table was gorgeous where a center 
piece of bright pink roses formed the color note. Brilhant yellow 
daffodils adorned another table, but the third and by far the most 
beautiful table contained a large cut glass bowl filled with the 
roadside flower called "Queen's Lace Handkerchief," its dainty 
white blossoms beautiful as the cobweb affair which such a 
handkerchief is supposed to be, with maiden hair ferns noth- 
ing more exquisite can be imagined. It cost the hostess only a 
pleasant trip to the outskirts of town where she found plenty to 
be had for the picking. The beautiful field daisies grow wild nearly 
all summer. Placed in cut glass bowls and used with gold banded 
china they make most attractive table decoration. If one has a 
beautiful center-piece of lace or embroidered linen it may be placed 
on the tablecloth under the bowl, vase or basket containing the 
flowers, and table mirrors are also used. Floral decorations should 
be low when guests are to be seated, but high effects may be used 
when guests stand. Be careful and do not have the illumination 
too brilliant; softly shaded lights or candles are more becoming 
and in better taste. 



350 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

Serving. 
When everything is ready the hostess very quietly announces 
the fact to those nearest to her and together they start towards 
the dining room, thus giving the signal for the others to follow. 
It is extremely bad form for the host to announce in stentorian 
tones to the assembled company that "dinner is served," as this 
should be done by the butler alone, and his place should not be 
usurped. In this country where few people keep a butler, this 
public announcement should be omitted. The seat of honor for 
ladies is at the right of the host and for gentlemen at the right of 
the hostess. When all have been seated the serving should proceed 
as quietly as possible, and no matter what may happen or what 
accident may occur, the hostess should never betray any nervous- 
ness, nothing is more distressing to guests than to see a hostess ill 
at ease and anxious. Plates, whether filled or empty, should al- 
ways be placed upon the table from the right side of each person 
and removed from the same side, but all platters or dishes to be 
served from, should be presented at the left side. The tray is not 
now used in passing and removing plates but instead, a squarely 
folded napkin is held by the waiter under the plate. The hostess 
should always be served first. Do not remove all of the plates at 
the end of a course before serving the following course, but in- 
stead, a plate for the next course should be exchanged for the one 
which has just been used, thus leaving a plate continually in front 
of each person. Remove and serve only one plate at a time, never pile 
plates upon each other. The crumb scraper is seldom used at for- 
mal dinners, but if necessary, it should be just before the dessert. 
The waitress should be gowned in black with stiff white collar and 
outside cuffs, a white apron with bretelles over the shoulder trim- 
med with lace or embroidery or simply hemstitched, and a little 
cap or bow of white muslin on the head. Unless a professional 
caterer is engaged the menu should be plainly written out by the 
hostess, together with a list of dishes to be used, and pinned up in 
the kitchen so as to avoid confusion or forgetfulness on the part 
of the cook. 



TABLE ETIQUETTE AND MENUS. 351 

The Formal Dinner. 

The formal dinner party is the most ceremonial function which 
can be given. Some of the courses are arranged on the plates be- 
fore being brought to the dining room, other courses are artistic- 
ally arranged on platters, garnished and passed, the necessary 
forks and spoons for serving them lying on the top a little to one 
side. Oysters or clams should be served on the half shell for a for- 
mal dinner. If canapes are used they take the place of the oysters 
or clams and should be arranged on small plates before being brought 
to the table. The soup or bouillon is usually served in the soup 
plates or bouillon cups before being brought in, the soup tureen 
is not generally used for formal dinners. The fish, meat, game, 
salad and dessert may be served according to the desire of the 
hostess, either by having the plates filled and garnished in the 
kitchen or from a beautifully garnished platter at the table. The 
latter way is most popular as there is much attention paid to garn- 
ishings at present. Sherbet follows the meat course or is served 
with it. It is served in fancy glasses. It is quite customary to 
serve a vegetable salad with the game and only vegetable or fruit 
salads should be served at a dinner. The lighter and more simple 
the salad for a dinner, the better. Fruit should be arranged and 
passed in a fruit dish or comport. Cheese with Bar le Due cur- 
rants and wafers are appropriate at both dinners and luncheons. 
Nuts and raisins are not used as much as formerly at dinners. 
Coffee should be clear and strong, served in small cups from the 
kitchen or poured at the table by the hostess. The cup should 
be placed at the right hand of the guest and cream and sugar passed 
on a small tray at the left. Sauce dishes should not be used at 
formal dinners, all vegetables should be served dry and taken 
upon the plate. It is quite customary to serve the coffee in the 
drawing room after dinner, instead of serving it at the table, in 
which case it is brought in with the coffee service on a tray and 
poured from the coffee pot either by the hostess or maid. Salted 
nuts are eaten during the dinner and candy or confections passed 
after the last course. It is not fashionable now to have more than 
six or eight courses at the most formal dinners. The old days 
when twenty and even twenty-five courses were served, and the 
hospitality of the host was reckoned by the number of hours which 
he kept his guests at table, have gone, let us hope never to return. 
Dinners should be served expeditiously, but without seeming haste. 
Each course should be ready on time, a dragging dinner is tire- 
some. At the close of the dinner the signal is given by the hostess 



352 THE MENDELSSOHN CLUB COOK BOOK. 

pushing her chair back from the table, the others rise and follow 
her into the drawing room. Sometimes the gentlemen remain in 
the dining room to enjoy cigars or cigarettes, the ladies going alone 
to the drawing room, but if a host has a smoking room all leave 
the table together, the gentlemen then following the host for a 
smoke in his own territory. 

In serving wines, three different kinds are enough for the 
grandest occasions. Sherry or madeira with the soup or fish, 
champagne with the roast, claret or any red wine with the game. 
If one wishes wine with the dessert use port, burgundy or any fine 
wine. Very small glasses of liquors such as creme de menthe, apri- 
cot brandy or benedictine, are often served at the end of the din- 
ner after the coffee. If champagne alone is used, begin to serve it 
with the meat course. 

Unfermented grape juice is an excellent substitute for those 
whose conscientious scruples do not allow them to serve wine. No 
one need hesitate to give dinners without wine. Public sentiment 
has grown so strong on this question that it forbids criticism as to 
the propriety of omitting it. Dinners without wine are considered 
in as good or better taste, by many sensible people, than with it.

The Informal Dinner. 



"We'll have some half a dozen friends, 
And there an end." 

— Romeo and Juliet. 



The informal dinner is served much like the formal dinner, 
except there is more served at the table. The hostess often serves 
the soup from a soup tureen placed before her on the table. Fish 
or meat may be carved by the host. Vegetables need not be served 
dry, but if moist the dish containing them together with saucers 
may be placed upon a tray and passed to each guest to serve him- 
self. The hostess usually makes the salad at the table, but it is 
very attractive for the host to perform this duty provided he can 
make a good salad. The hostess serves the puddings and the host 
the pies, if they are served at the table. The informal dinner 
should really be en famille and should be served thus every day by 
the good housekeeper. Fewer people are invited at a time to the 
informal than to the formal dinner.

Luncheon. 
Luncheon is served Uke dinner and a formal luncheon varies 
but slightly from a formal dinner. Oysters are served cocktail 
style,, canapes are used also in place of oysters as at dinner. Soup 
is often omitted and the meat course is not as heavy. Luncheons 
are usually for ladies only, and the fair sex is not supposed to en- 
joy the hearty food which the stern sex demands. The time of 
day also calls for lighter food than can be served at the dinner hour. 
If one has a handsome table, by all means let it be bare for luncheon, 
using doilies in place of a tablecloth. This gives the hostess a 
chance to display many treasures of her linen chest not otherwise 
seen. Doilies may be of costly lace, lace and hnen, embroidered 
linen or hand crochetted lace. The latter is very fashionable and 
if one is handy with her hook, a most beautiful set can be made 
with very little expense. A set of doilies should consist of one 
dozen plate doilies about 13 inches in diameter, one dozen 8 inches 
in diameter for cup and saucer, one dozen 5 inches in diameter 
for tumblers, a center-piece to match, two or four doilies about 
15 inches in diameter to use under bon bon dishes and other dishes. 
If one has not a handsome table it is much better to use a fine 
damask cloth. Colored cloths with napkins to match are sometimes 
used at luncheons. Fruits are used more at luncheon than at din- 
ner. A salpicon of fruit or fruit soup is very nice for the first course 
instead of oysters or canape. Hot rolls are generally served with 
the meat or game course; they are buttered in the kitchen before 
sending to the table. Coffee is also served with this course. Great 
latitude is allowed as to the number of courses served at luncheon 
and a simple luncheon is quite as good, or better form, than a very 
elaborate meal. Many hostesses darken the dining room and use 
artificial light for luncheon parties, but this fashion is waning.

Breakfasts. 



"Dinner may be pleasant; 

So may social tea; 
But yet, methinksthe breakfast 

Is best of all the three." 

— Anon. 



Breakfast parties make a pleasant variety in the way of enter- 
taining. The hour -for breakfast parties varies from 9 to 12 o'clock. 
In some cities they are given as late as 2 in the afternoon. An 
early hour is preferable as otherwise guests are obliged to retain 
their strength by eating first at home and then a fine breakfast 
would not be enjoyed. Eight or 9 o'clock is perhaps the best hour. 
Macauley, the historian, was very fond of breakfast parties and 
in praising their merits said, "Dinner parties are mere formalities, 
but you invite a man to breakfast because you want to see him." 
Four courses are usually enough for breakfasts. Fruit or melons, 
fish, a light meat or game course with two vegetables and 
accessories and lastly a dessert of shortcake, waffles or something 
appropriate to the meal. At breakfast parties the silver service 
for tea and coffee remains on the table all the time, otherwise the 
breakfast is served like dinner. Soup and salad should not be 
served at a breakfast.

Gentlemen's Suppers. 

Gentlemen's suppers resemble ladies' luncheons in their ex- 
clusiveness as to sex. The food should be heavier. Gentlemen 
enjoy more hearty and less dainty food while ladies enjoy more 
dainty and less hearty. Fish, meat and game are all generally 
included in gentlemen's parties.

Receptions, Teas and Card Parties. 

For receptions and card parties only light refreshments should 
be served, but for wedding receptions and ball suppers three courses 
are not too many. At a reception in a large house, coffee or choco- 
late with a salad and sandwiches are often served in the dining 
room, and ices and small cakes in another room from a small table. 
This is an excellent plan in any house where a large company is 
invited as it relieves the pressure in the dining room. 

Five o'clock Tea is the most simple and inexpensive form 
of entertainment and it is also one of the most attractive. People 
who are not wealthy can in this way repay their social obligations 
most charmingly. An afternoon tea is not a meal, simply a de- 
licious cup of tea with small thin bread and butter sandwiches 
with or without a filling, small cakes or cookies and if one wishes, a 
few confections. Sometimes a glass of sherbet is served. The 
serving may be done in the dining room or the tea table may be 
placed in the parlor where the hostess receives her guests seated 
at the table and brews a good cup of tea while she chats with them. 
The English generally serve toasted muffins and marmalade with 
tea. "At Homes" and "High Teas" are the same as "FiveO'clocks."

Thanksgiving Dinner. 

Our National Birds — The American Eagle, the Thanksgiving 
Turkey. 

"May one give us peace in all our states — 
And the other a piece for all our plates." 



Have the table decorations in yellow, and carry out this color 
scheme as far as possible in the courses to be served. For center- 
piece take a large fine pumpkin that will stand flat on the bottom. 
Cut off the upper third, remove seeds and membrane. Stand a 
tall vase in the center of it and put yellow chrysanthemums in the 
vase, around it fill the pumpkin with fruit, oranges, apples and 
allow clusters of white grapes to fall over the edges. Place the 
pumpkin on a low silver tray and around it put 3 or 4 oranges 
with the skin cut part way down in quarters and turned back like 
rose leaves. Add also a few chrysanthemums with their own foli- 
age. This can be passed at the close of the meal for the fruit course.

Christmas Dinner. 
The Christmas colors should be used, red and green. A large 
cut glass bowl filled with holly branches and^ glowing poinsetta 
blossoms is an attractive center-piece. The salad should be served 
in large red peppers. Select fine ones with stems, cut off top, re- 
move seeds, fill with the salad, replace top. The upright stem 
serves as a handle.
