WOMAN'S CITY CLUB 
COOK BOOK 



COMPILED BY 

THE LIBRARY COMMITTEE 

OF THE 

WOMAN'S CITY CLUB OF CHICAGO 



/ 

A 



CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 

1923 



The Library Committee wishes to ex- 
press its grateful appreciation to all who 
have aided in compiling this book, and its 
regret that on account of the limited time it 
was not possible to reach all members of the 
Club; also, because of duplicates, it was nec- 
essary to eliminate many good recipes so that 
too much space would not be devoted to any 
one subject. 

It is sincerely hoped that this little book 
will meet with the kindly approval of all who 
use it. 

Isabel Mariner Mitchell, 

Chairman.

GENERAL RULES FOR LEAVENING AGENTS 

Miss Jenny H. Snow 

1. All standard baking powders are of comparatively the same 
strength, so use the same amount in substituting for one another. 

2. Use two level teaspoons of baking powder to one cup of 
flour. 

3. One teaspoon of soda is equal in strength to thrcQ tea- 
spoons of baking powder, so in substituting baking powder for soda, 
use three times as much baking powder as soda. 

4. Use one-half a teaspoon of soda with one cup of sour milk. 

5. One teaspoon of soda is the maximum amount to use with 
one cup of molasses. 

6. In sour milk mixtures, such as griddle cakes, both soda 
and baking powder are necessary. With one cup of sour milk and 
one cup of flour, use one-half of soda and one-half of baking pow- 
der, the, two together being equal to the two teaspoons of baking 
powder required for one cup of flour. With one cup of sour milk 
and two cups of flour, use one-half a teaspoon of soda and two and 



BREADS  15 

one-half of baking powder, the two together to the four teaspoons 
of baking powder required for two cups of flour. 

7. When eggs are used, reduce the amount of baking powder. 
One teaspoon of baking powder is equal to two eggs. 

8. In yeast mixtures, the amount of yeast to be used does not 
depend on the amount of flour or liquid, but on the food, tempera- 
ture and length of time. In general use, one cake to three cups of 
liquid. In shortening the process two or three cakes of yeast may 
be used.
