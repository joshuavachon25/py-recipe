1909 


Entered according to Act of Parliament of Canada, in the year one thousand 
nine hundred and nine, by Thb Ogilyib Flour Mills Company, Limitbd, 
of Montreal, at the Department of Agriculture, Ottawa. 





T he Ogilvie Flour Mills Co., 
Ltd., after a careful study of the 
needs of the home-bakers, decided 
to make a flour particularly suited to 
their requirements. The results was 
Royal Household, so named because 
it is used by the Ro}/al family. 

This flour is carefully milled from the 
very choicest wheat grown in Canada, 
and each day’s milling is subjected to a 
practical baking test before it is allowed 
to be given out to the consumer. 

Every pound of it is guaranteed, and 
is especially adapted for either bread or 
pastry. 

The , recipes herein presented have 
been tried, TESTED and proved. They 
are not offered as a general cook book, 
nor as a guide to experts, but simply as 
a help to the average housekeeper in the 
hope that it will make easier her search 
after a variety of good things without 
calling top much upon her means. 

OUR MOTTO: 

Highest quality consistent with strict 
uniformity.

F ailure and disappointment often 
confront the young and inexperien- 
ced housekeeper (and sometimes the 
experienced one as well) through the 
misunderstanding or omission of some 
. little detail in preparation. The follow- 
ing recipes have been thoronghly tested, 
wherever possible the exact amount of 
ingredients to be used is given, and we 
know them, to be absolntely correct, yet 
to any user of this book who has failed 
to obtain satisfactory results or who is 
in need of still more explicit directions, 
we will gladly furnish the services of an 
expert woman, as a correspondent, who 
will answer all questions, and give any 
suggestions possible. 

In writing, please note carefully the 
following directions :

What it is. 


Good yeast consists of thousands of tiny plants 
or germs, and is one of the simplest forms of vege- 
table life, belonging to the same family as mould 
and mildew. It is an almost transparent cell, round 
or oval, filled with sap. 

/ 

Its Growth. 

The growth, which is more frequently spoken of 
'as “fermentation,’* consists of the reproduction again 
and again of these little one-celled organisms. This 
goes on very quickly under proper conditions. One 
plant buds out from the otner sometimes in the fornJ 
of a chain, or two buds may confe from one cell, and 
in this way the yeast plant multiplies. 

Its Care. 

While these little yeast cells are tenacious of life 
they are killed by exposure to extremes of either 
heat or cold, such as boiling water, or frost, but 
will keep for many days in a dry, cool place. The 
best collection of yeast cells massed together in 
dormant state is the ordinary yeast cake either dry 
or compressed. 


Dried Yeast. 



The dried yeast is the best form in which yeas, 
can be obtained for the use of those who live in the 
country, or in places where it may be necessary to 
keep the yeast for some length of time. Being dry 
the cakes cannot decay, but if kept too long the 
yeast will lose its vitality. 

Compressed Yeast. 

The compressed moist yeast keeps, as a rule, 
only for a few days. Some of the manufacturers 
state, however, that it will keep for a month or so 
if placed under cold water so as to be kept from the 
air. This form of yeast generally gives the best 
results, and is more easily used than other forms. 
In towns it is usually distributed by the manufac- 
turers every two or three days. When fresh it 
should have a pleasant wine like smell and crisp 
feeling. If dark and mouldy it is old. If it breaks 
like putty it is weak. 




its Relation to Bread Making. 

For rapid growth it requires a moderately warm 
moist, sweet, soil such as dough. Sugar hastens the 
growth, while salt retards it. During its growth it 
changes some of the starch of the flour into sugar, 
on which it feeds, at the same time giving off alco- 
hol, and a gas known as Carbon dioxide. 

This, in its efforts to escape, expands the elastic 
gluten (which is a large constituent of flour) and 
’ifts up the dough, or in other words it is “raised.” 

When the bread is placed in the oven, the heat 
expands the gas. This is what causes the loaf to 
“raise” in the oven. Finally the alcohol and gas 
are driven off, the cell-walls are fixed, and then, 
sweet bread is produced. 


NOTES ON YEAST 

Use less yeast in summer than in winter. 

Royal yeast works slowly and is always better 
set with a sponge over night. Royal yeast will not 
work at all unless kept warm. Compressed yeast 
is very rapid and does not require so much warmth. 

^ cake Compressed yeast is equal to 1 cake 
Royal yeast or % cuip home-made yeast. 

Be sure that yeast or yeast cakes are fresh. 


NOTES ON BREADMAKING. 


It is better to use a pail to mix bread in than 
the ordinary bread pan, as there is less surface ex- 
posed and easier to wrap up, and can readily be 
placed in a dish of warm water to aid rising. Best 
length of time for sponge to rise is nine or ten 
hours. If you take it early in the morning, set 
earlier in the evening and vice versa. 

Always make a sponge when Royal yeast cakes 
are used. With home-made or Compressed yeast it 
may be made into a dough at once. 

A sponge should always rise at least twice its 
size or until it begins to fall. 

Dough should always double itself and should 
increase twice its size when placed in the pans. 

Do not work dough too much as it is better to 
underwork than to overwork. 

Do not let it rise too much in dough or it will 
be slow in pans. 

Do not have oven too hot as bread should not 
brown the first ten minutes, and only gradually 
after that. 

Do not cover when taken out of oven, but allow 
to cool quickly. 

Do not make loaves too large. 


(See Page 8) 



ROYAL HOUSEHOLD requires 
less work than ordinary hard wheat 
flours. 

I 

Dont’ knead it too mucli 

It goes together quickly and easily, 
requiring only two or three minutes 
beating in the sponge or batter and a 
few minutes kneading in the dough 
untill it becomes smooth and elastic. 

It DOES NOT require a second 
kneading after it has risen in the bowl 
or pail, simply close the hand and punch 
down thoroughly.

BREAD 


Canada 



“With Bread 

all griefs are less.” 

Good bread is the great need of both rich and 
poor. 

It has been man’s chief food for thousands of 
years. 

Compared with wheat flour, all other materials 
are insignificant. 

More good nourishment can be purchased for 
less money than in any other food. 

ROYAL HOUSEHOLD excels all others in this 
respect and should always be used with these reci- 
pes 

In the process of bread making, the manage- 
ment and control of the yeast and its fermentation 
is usually the least understood part of the operation; 
and it is owing to mistakes in its treatment that the 
greater number of failures in bread-making are due. 

No manipulation of the flour or dough will com- 
pensate for weak or badly prepared yeast. 

The other factors of uncertainty in bread-making 
consist chiefly of insufficient care in kneading and 
the difference in the quality of flours. 

Flour taken from a cold place should be warmed 
before using to about 75 or 80 degrees. 

Have water and milk same temperature. If milk 
is used it should be scalded and allowed to cool. 

Mix thoroughly, but do not overwork. Make 
small loaves and bake well. 


HOUSEHOLD WHITE BREAD 


Materials. 


2 cups milk. 

2 cups water (or 4 cups if milk is left out.) 
1 teaspoon butter or lard. 

3 tablespoons sugar. 

1 tablespoon salt. 

2 cakes Compressed yeast. 

to cuips (more or less) Ogilvie’s Royal 
Household. 



9 


Preparation. 


^ 



Canada 


Scald the milk and water, and while scalding 
hot pour the liquid over the butter, sugar and* salt. 
Dissolve the yeast in ^ cup lukewarm water. When 
the milk and water have cooled to lukewarm, beat 
into it five cups of sifted flour with a wooden spoon, 
add the dissolved yeast and beat well for two or 
three minutes. Then stir and knead in flour until 
the dough is sufficiently stiff to be turned from the 
mixing bowl to the moulding board in a mass. The 
quantity of flour to be added may be more or less 
than the five cups, depending on the temperature 
and dryness of the flour, Knead the dough until it 
becomes -smooth and elastic and ceases to stick to 
the fingers or moulding board, adding if necessary a 
little flour from time to time. Then put in a well 
greased earthen bowl, brush lightly with butter, cover 
with a bread towel and set to rise in a moderately 
warm place until light or increased twice its size. 
This will require about two hours. As soon as bread 
is light, punch down and set for another rising until 
light which will require about one hour. As soon 
as it is light, form gently into loaves or rolls, place 
in greased bread pans, brush with melted butter 
and let stand for one and a half hour, or until very 
light, then bake in a moderate oven for, depending 
on size of loaf, forty to sixty minutes. This quantity 
makes five small loaves. (See page 8). 


NOTE. — Be careful not to use too much flour. 
Make the dough as soft as can be handled. 

N.B. — ^Our ‘‘Meota” (whole wheat) flour makes 
excellent bread with this recipe. 


Materials. 


POTATO YEAST. 


8 large potatoes. 

4 tablespoons Ogilvie*s Royal Household. 

4 tablespoons salt. 

4 tablespoons granulated sugar. 

4 cups (1 quart) boiling water. 

16 cups (4 quarts) cold water. 

2 cakes of Royal Yeast or 1 cake of com- 
pressed. 


10 


Preparation. 

Peel and boil the potatoe's, mash in water boiled 
in, and, while boiling pour this over the flour, salt 
and sugar. To this add the boiling water, mix well 
then add the cold water. Dissolve the yeast in ^ 
cup lukewarm water and mix with the above. Let 
this mixture remain in a warm place about eighteen 
hours, when it is ready for use, keep in a cool place 
and use as required. 

POTATO BREAD. 

Materials. 

4 cups Potato yeast. 

1 tablespoon salt. 

1 tablespoon brown sugar. 

1 tablespoon butter. 

10 cuips (more or less) Ogilvie’s Royal 
Household. 

Preparation. 

Set the yeast liquid on the stove and stir until 
about blood heat (98 degrees Fahrenheit), then add 
the salt, sugar ,and butter, mix in sufficient of the 
flour (previously warmed) to make a batter. This 
will require three to four cups Cover and set to 
rise. When light and frothy add the balance of the 
flour or until the dough ceases to stick to the hands 
or moulding board, kineading only until smooth and 
elastic. This makes five small loaves. 

Let rise again until double the original size of 
dough, when it may be moulded gently into loaves, 
placed in greased bread pans and brushed with 
melted butter. Let it stand in a warm place covered 
with a clean cloth, until it has again doubled its 
bulk, then bake it in a moderate oven for about 
sixty minutes. 

N.B. — Our' “Meota” (whole wheat) ; flour makes 
excellent bread with this recipe. (See page 8 ).

Preparation. 


I < 



Let yeast cake dissolve in cup lukewarm water 
for about 10 minutes. Put salt into mixing pan. 
Add water and enough flour to make a stiff batter 
(about the consistency of pan-cake mixture). Add 
yeast and beat two or three minutes; put in warm 
place to rise over night; in the morning sponge 
should be twice its size. Add enough flour to make 
a dough stiff enough not to stick to hands or board; 
after flour is all mixed in, turn mass out on bread 
board and knead two or three minutes; let rise again 
about two and a half times its size, then mould 
lightly into pans, cover well ahd let rise times 
its size. Bake in a moderate oven until loaf is nice- 
ly browned and feels light when taken out of pan 
(See page 8).

What Flour Granulation 
Means in Bread- Making 


Flour is composed of myriads of tiny 
granules. 

The small ones absorb yeast, “rise” 
and “ripen” before the large ones ; 
the result is bread of coarse, poor 
texture. 

ROYAL HOUSEHOLD Flour is 
perfectly milled, all the flour granu- 
les are uniform in size, the sponge 
rises uniformly, the bread is even in 
texture, perfect in flavour, good-look- 
ing, appetising bread, easy digested.

What is meant by 
“Protein” in flour ? 


“ Protein in food is the food ele- 
ment that makes bones, muscle and 
brain. 

Pure flour contains more pretein, in 
most useful form, than any other food ; 
but the flour must be pure. 

ROYAL HOUSEHOLD Flour is 
milled to make it the purest in the 
world ; therefore it contains most pro- 
tein, is most nourishing, is most econo- 
mical to use. 

It pays the housewife to insist upon 
getting “Royal Household” guaranteed 
flour, instead of taking a poorer flour 
which the grocer may be interested in 
selling.

CAKES 



“Dost thou think because thou art 
virtuous, there shall be no more cakes?” 

—TWELFTH NIGHT 


Cake-making requires more judgment than any 
other department of cooking. Nevertheless it is one 
of the most frequently tried by the beginner. 

There are two classes of cakes; those with but- 
ter and those without it. The former embraces 
pound, cup, and fruit cake; to the latter belongs 
sponge, sunshine, and angel-cake. 

Always mix cake in an earthen bowl. The bak- 
ing of cake requires more care than the mixing. Di- 
vide the baking time into quarters; during the first 
it should begin to rise, the second it should finish 
rising and begin to brown, in the third it should 
continue to brown ,and during the fourth and last 
it should finish browning and leave the sides of the 
pan. 


Bake cake with nothing else in the oven and 
keep it as near the oven centre as possible. Remove 
the cake from the tin as soon as it leaves the oven, 
and place it on a sieve or a napkin covered board.

The digestibility of pies has been called into 
question, but when properly made pies are as easily 
digested as anything else. 

Until quite recently it has been taken for grant- 
ed, by the majority of people, that it was impossible 
to make good pastry out of Manitoba wheat flour 
without using a large amount of shortening. 

They have thought it necessary to keep two 
kinds of flour, one for bread, and the other for pas- 
try. This idea is erroneous. 

ROYAL HOUSEHOLD makes the most deli- 
cious pastry when same amount of shortening is 
used as with ordinary pastry flour. Try it with the 
following recipes. 

Paste for pies should be kept cold, rolled quite 
thin and a little larger than the tin to allow for 
shrinkage. Allow more paste for the upper than 
the under crust, and be sure to perforate the former. 
Always brush around the edge of the undercrust 
with cold water and press the upper one down on it. 
When baking a juicy fruit pie make an incision in 
the centre and place a small funnel-shaped piece of 
paper into it. 

This will keep the juice from escaping at the sides 
of the pie. Never grease a pie tin. Properly made 
pastry will grease its own tin. 

PLAIN PASTRY 

4 cups (sifted) Ogilvie’s Royal Household. 
1 cup ice cold water. 

% cup butter. 

% cup lard. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

Preparation. 

Mix salt with flour. With two knives cut in 
shortening, or rub in well with fingers. Add wa- 
ter little by little, stirring it in with a knife. Keep 
all materials and utensils as cold as possible dur- 
ing the whole process and work quickly. This is 
important. Roll out fold from the ends towards 
the centre making three layers. This may be used 



n 


at once, but is improved by putting in a cold place 
for several hours or over night and may be kept 
for three or four days. Do not let it freeze. 

Be careful not to make paste too stiff. Just so 
it can be handled without sticking, is the proper 
consistency. Use more ice cold water if necessary. 


PUFF PASTE. 

Materials. 

4 cups (1 pound) Ogilvie’s Royal Household. 

2 cups (1 pound) butter. 

1 cup ice cold water. 

Preparation. 

Wash the butter thoroughly or until free from 
salt. Put both flour and butter in a cold place. Keep 
all utensils ice cold while working the dough. This 
is important. Mix about one-fourth of the butter 
into the flour adding enough ice cold water to make 
a nice paste. Roll out about one-fourth inch thick, 
spread more butter on with a knife and fold from 
ends towards centre making three layers. Repeat 
this until all the butter is worked in or at least three 
or four times to obtain the best results. The paste 
should then be put in a cold place for several hours, 
over night is better but do not allow it to freeze. If 
outside temperature is not sufficiently cold, fold paste 
in a towel, put in a small pan and place between two 
other pans of crushed ice. If paste is to be kept for 
several days, wrap in a napkin, put in tin pail and 
cover tightly, then put in a cold place. If in ice box, 
do not allow pail to come in direct contact with ice. 

Be careful not to make paste too stiff. Just so 
it can be handled without sticking, is the proper 
consistency. Use more Ice coild water if necessary. 

Bake in a moderately hot oven.

Next to bread, meat forms the principal food on 
our tables. 

Always remember that the cheaper parts of a 
first class animal may be prepared to furnish far 
better dishes than the high priced portions of an 
inferior animal; in other words, a stew from the 
forequarter of a first-class animal will be better 
than a roast from the loin of an inferior animal, 
and it will be cheaper. 

If meat is tough, soak in vinegar and water for 
six or seven hours in proportion of one and one 
half-pints of. vinegar to six quarts of water. 

Always cut across the grain of the muscle. 

Never wash fresh meat before roasting. Scrape 
if necessary to clean it. If it has been wet. wipe 
thoroughly dry before cooking. 

Do not put meat directly on ice, place in a 
vessel.

HOW “ROYAL HOUSEHOLD” IS DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS. 




“The chief pleasure in eating does not consist 
in costly seasoning or exquisite flavour, but in your- 
self/^ — Horace. 


The use of the chafing dish is, contrary to gen- 
eral opinion, far older than our present civilization. 
It reaches in some form back into the times of the 
ancient Greeks and Romans. 

As used at present, alcohol is the fuel for the 
lamp attached to it, and a tray is desirable to pro- 
tect tablecloths and table from alcohol and fire. The 
cap covering the opening through which the lamp 
is filled, should be kept in place after filling it. 
Otherwise controlling the flame is hardly possible. 


A chafing-dish needs to be watched carefully 
from a chair with a high seat to make its use com- 
fortable. For the beneht of the comparatively few 
who can and care to indulge in its use, the follow- 
ing recipes are presented.

prettiest dishejs from the sideboard, being careful 
to place everything in an orderly and convenient 
manner. Serve hot food on hot dishes, cold food 
on cold dishes. 

For feverish patients, cold water mixed with 
fruit juices is refreshing and beneficial.

Broken china may be mended by making a light 
paste out of the white of an egg and flour, cleaning 
the broken edges from dust,' and spreading with the 
paste and holding the parts while wet, wiping off 
all that oozes out. It must be held or fastened in 
position until dry. 


RUST STAINS ON WHITE GOODS. 

Lemon juice and salt will remove rust stains 
from linen or muslin without effecting the goods. 
Let the sun shine on the goods after having mois- 
tened the spots with the mixture — two or three ap- 
plications may be necessary. 



GRASS STAINS ON CLOTHING 

Should be saturated with alcohol for a little 
time, then wash in clear water. 


REMOVING STARCH FROM IRONS 

Should starch cling to your iron while using it, 
sprinkle some salt on a piece of brown paper and 
rub the iron on it. 


TO SOFTEN BOOTS AND SHOES. 

Rub your boots and shoes well with castor oil 
and let them stand twelve hours. This will keep 
them from cracking and make them yielding and 
soft.

KEROSENE OIL. 


Coal oil will help the housekeeper out of many 
difficulties. A spoonful of Kerosene added to a 
kettle of wery hot water will make windows, look- 
ing-glasses and picture glasses bright and clear. 
Use a small clean cloth, wring it dry and rub it 
over the glass after wiping down the frame work 
with an oiled cloth. Then proceed to the next win- 
dow and treat it similarly on both sides. After 
that go back to the first one and wipe it dry with 
a large clean cloth. No real polishing is required 
and the windows or glass will look clean and shiny. 

Kerosene will clean your hands better than 
anything else after blacking a range or stove. Pour 
a little in the water, wash your hands in it, then 
wash in tepid water, and finally in hot water with 
plenty of soap, and using a stiff nail brush. Finish 
by rubbing the hands with lemon and glycerine. 

When your kitchen sink is rusty rub it over 
with kerosene. 

Squeaky shoes are cured by dipping the soles 
in kerosene. Use enough to reach the top of the 
soles without reaching the upper leather. 

The white spots appearing in the spring on the 
lining of your refrigerator will disappear if you 
rub the zinc with kerosene. Leave the refrigerator 
open several hours, then wash with water, soap and 
some ammonia. The refrigerator will then be clean 
and sweet, all spots will have disappeared. 


TO DESTROY INSECTS. 

Insects may be destroyed with hot alum- Put 
in hot water and let boil until the alum is dissolved. 
Apply hot with a brush and all creeping things are 
instantly destroyed without danger to human life or 
injury to property. 


TO GET RID OF RATS. 

To get clear of rats, besides using traps, cats, 
or dogs, try chloride of lime. It is said they never 
come where that is placed. 


121 


TO FLAVOR SOUPS. 



Turnip peel washed clean and tied in a knot 
imparts a flavor to soups. Celery leaves and ends 
serve the same purpose. 


INK SPOTS ON FINGERS. 

Ink is removed from the fingers in a very sim- 
ple manner. Wet the fingers and then rub the 
phosphorus end of a match until the spot has disap- 
peared. 

RELEASING ICE CREAM OR JELLY 
FROM MOULDS. 


Fold a hot cloth around the mould and jelly or 
ices will leave without sticking. 


CLEANING PAINT. 

Put two ounces of soda in a Quart of hot water, 
and wash with it, rinsing the paint off with pure 
water.
