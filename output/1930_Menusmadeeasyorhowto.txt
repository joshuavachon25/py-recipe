PREFACE 



One of the chief aims of the Art of Cookery is variety. 
In the following pages so large a number of dishes are 
given that no diflSculty can be experienced in attaining 
that object. That this is so is, in a measure, evidenced 
by the fact that so many editions have already been 
called for. 

In the present edition the work has been divided into 
sections under its chapters, and in each section the 
dishes have been arranged in alphabetical order, for 
greater convenience of reference. 

Many dishes have been added, while others that have 
ceased to be in demand have been struck out. 

There will be found considerable additions in the 
entremets, both sweet and savoury, in the treatment of 
various fruits, and in iced dishes now so much in 
request. 

The increased facilities for ice-making, due to the 
number of inexpensive freezing machines now obtain- 
able, have made such dishes much more general than 
they were a few years back. A variety of them is now 
given, and in addition to the sweet ices, those made with 
fish, vegetables, cheese, etc. 

The author has adhered to her principle of not 
including dishes that take their name merely from the 



VI PREFACE 

mould in which they are prepared, such as Belgrave, 
Monaco, Trots Freres, etc. Exception must, however, 
be made in the case of some that have secured for 
themselves a position in the culinary world that is likely 
to survive when the moulds after which they are called 
may have fallen into disuse. Examples of these are 
shown in Bombes, Flombieres, and Timbaks. 

Neither are such dishes enumerated as owe their 
name to a passing interest, such as the visit of some 
foreign royalty, . a prominent statesman or general, or 
some social event or ceremonial. These dishes have no 
culinary importance. They often hardly diffej: from 
those already well known. Such interest as they have 
would be purely historical, and even were the event 
worth recording, the study of history is not profitably 
pursued in the kitchen ! 

The subject of decoration of dishes will be found to 
be touched upon in the Introduction. One additional 
suggestion is now offered. The garnish of flowers or 
ferns has occasionally been introduced. This the author 
desires strongly to deprecate. Not to speak of the 
possibility of spiders or earwigs, in such a position 
flowers become technically weeds, i.e. plants out of 
place. They are certainly not intended to be eaten, and 
a non-edible decoration is suggestive of the waxen 
figures and such abominations that have now happily 
died out. 

It is hoped that the alterations made will render this 
little book more useful to those who, while desirous of 
a well-ordered cuisine, have yet little time to spare from 
more important and more profitable occupations, for the 
consideration of " the pleasures of the table."

INTRODUCTION 



This publication is a humble endeavour to afford some 
assistance to ladies in the daily difficulty of what to order 
for dinner, and how to describe it. 

Cooks are not generally gifted with fertile imagina- 
tions, and are inclined to get into a routine which is 
a source of annoyance to those who desire a variety of 
disheS) if not for themselves, at least for their friends. 
Ladies often wish to be ready with suggestions of a 
change in the proposals of the cook, and even when 
in some measure provided with these, a second difficulty 
arises — What are these dishes to be called ? What are 
the correct technical names for them ? 

The French of cookery is a language of itself, and 
those who are not learned in it are often entirely at a 
loss when suddenly called on to write out a correct 
French menu with no other assistance than that of a 
dictionary. In carrying out this idea, lists of various 
dishes have been given, arranged in courses, with the 
French names, as well as the English equivalents or 
descriptions. 

Dishes of a very elaborate character have, for the 
most part, been rejected. They are often merely what a 
gardener would term "sports" from well-established 
originals, differing from them, perhaps, only in some 



X INTRODUCTION 

details of fantastic decoration, the fashions of which are 
very short-lived, and are quickly succeeded by some 
newer fancy. 

With regard to decoration, it is suggested that very 
fanciful effects should be avoided. In a zeal for 
originality in this respect, the object of all decoration — 
viz. to render the dish attractive — seems occasionally to 
be forgotten, and a contrary effect is produced. Dishes 
are presented more fit to adorn a confectioner's window 
than to appear at a gentleman's table. 

Compdunds of preserves and ices have actually been 
made to represent, with painful accuracy, boiled legs of 
mutton, boars' heads, etc., etc. 

It is a mistake, too, to give fantastic names to the 
dishes. A menu is intended to convey information, not 
to mislead or confuse ; and few people care to bestow 
sufficient attention on the subject to enjoy a succession 
of " surprises." 

Neither is a dish more generally appreciated for bear- 
ing an extravagant name — even when under such a title 
as Sastartks d la Malay are revealed the homely aspects 
of curried veal ! The rule that fine feathers make fine 
birds is not without exceptions. 

Names given to quenelles^ creams, etc., often have 
reference to the fancy moulds in which they are dressed. 
For instance, Petites crimes ati ChevaUer are creams 
steamed or set in moulds made to represent little horse- 
shoes. So petites cigttes, petits chevaux, papillons, etc., 
refer to the moulds. 

Even petites langties, petits jambonneaux, petits poukts , 
do not necessarily imply something made of tongue, 
ham, or chicken. 

Very few such names are introduced in these pages. 
They are obviously only the passing fashion of the 



INTRODUCTION xi 

moment, and do more credit to the skill of the iron- 
monger than to that of the cook. 

From the number of dishes described, it is hoped that 
it will be found easy to select such as shall be suited to 
the occasion for which they are required, whether for 
homely dinners, or for more elaborate entertainments. 
Complete menus of the former class will be found in the 
author's " Daily Dinners," which, with the assistance here 
given, may be enlarged or varied without difficulty. 

In planning a dinner, ladies are reminded not to be 
content with dishes individually excellent, without regard 
to the contrast they bear one to another. 

Variety is required, not only in the material, but also 
in the style of dressing, and in the accompanying sauces 
and garnishes. 

Light and dark dishes should as far as possible succeed 
one another. The same sauce should not appear twice. 
Several sorts of pastry should be avoided. Wlien cold 
dishes form part of the menu, they should be interspersed 
judiciously among the others. 

It is not intended to give recipes, such as would be 
adequate for the preparation of the dishes in the kitchen ; 
the dishes are only so far described as to enable the 
mistress to recognize them, giving a general idea of their 
ingredients and of their appearance when sent to table. 

The descriptions will probably be sufficient, in most 
cases, to suggest directions which a fairly competent 
cook may carry out without the aid of a detailed recipe. 
But should they be found insufficient, recourse may 
always be had to some of the excellent cookery-books 
now published.
