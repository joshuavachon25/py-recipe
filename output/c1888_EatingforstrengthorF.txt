PREFACE. 



In no peri^ of the world's history has there ever been so 
deep an interest in the subject of foods as at the present. At 
no time since Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden has 
agriculture and horticulture been so perfect, and the human 
race supplied with so many choice and nourishing articles of 
diet. And, also, at no time have so many been engaged in 
laborious researches on the nature of that which we eat and its 
relations to health and work. It would almost seem as if the 
time had nearly arrived when mankind would eat to live, 
would feed themselves so as to nourish their bodies most per- 
fectly and render themselves capable of the most labor, and 
least liable to disease. 

The object of this volume is to present the most recent facts 
of science in a way to make them valuable for actual use in 
daily life. There is no doubt but man may double his capa- 
pacity for work and for enjoyment by improving his dietetic 
habits. Many have already done this, and multitudes more 
are only waiting for the knowledge which will help them to 
do it. A thorough understanding of the different divisions of 
food and their right relation to the needs of the body is neces- 
sary, and this has been fully stated. Several new features 
have been introduced. To meet the requirements of that 
constantly increasing class who have more and more desire so 
far as is possible to draw their nourishment from the vegetable 
kingdom, carefully and elaborately prepared tables have 
been arranged showing just how much of each particular 
food one needs to consume in order to provide the body with 
the required amount of proteids, carbo-hydrates and fats.

PREFACE. 

These tables have been especially prepared for this work and 
are fall of interest as well as being of practical value. An- 
other interesting feature of the work relates to the cost of the 
different articles usually consumed, as for instance the cost of 
proteids, fats and carbo-hydrates in oatmeal, beef, mutton, 
corn, eggs, butter, cheese, beer, etc., etc. These tables are so 
arranged as to show at once which are the most economical 
artisles for the table and which the most expensive, and will 
be of great value to all who would choose their food wisely, 
and also for those who desire to reduce the cost of living to a 
minimum and yet nourish themselves perfectly. 

The chapter on the use of the apple as a means of preserv- 
ing health and the one on the grape cure will, the author 
believes, mieet a need long felt, as will also what has been 
said concerning the importance of the thorough mastication 
of our food. 

The subject of drinks has also been treated fully, and a 
very large number of recipes for wholesome ones given. What 
has been said on this subject cannot fail to prove helpful to 
those who are in doubt on many points. 

The directions for feeding young and delicate children have 
in practice proved most satisfactory. 

The time is near when a knowledge of the principles of diet 

will be considered as important a part of our education as 

a knowledge of the multiplication table. That this little 

work may help to hasten this time is the sincere desire of the 

author.

CHAPTER I. 
THE USES OF FOOD. 

Why do human beings eat ? Why do all animals, 
from the simplest worm to the most civilized man, 
depend for life on food and drink ? Why does a 
child become hungry, and if deprived of food be- 
yond a certain time, become ravenous ? Why does 
a hard-working man enjoy his food so well, and de- 
mand so much of it ? Why do great men and pow- 
erful thinkers eat so abundantly ? Why so many 
millions of acres of land devoted to agriculture and 
horticulture ? Why so many more farmers produc- 
ing food than people of any other occupation ? It 
is because food is so necessary to life and health. 
What, then, is the use which it performs ? 

1. It furnishes material from which to construct 
the body. The child receives milk from its mother's 
breast, which increases its size, and a large body is 
the result. Farmers increase or diminish the weight 
of domestic animals, within a certain limit, by in- 
creasing or diminishing the food supplied to them. 
The development, within constitutional limits, to 
which a child may attain is, to some extent, de- 
pendent on the supply of food it receives and di- 
gests. Abundance of food, with plenty of air, exer- 
cise and sleep, insures a healthier growth than a 
scanty diet. 

1* (9) 



10 USES OF FOOD. 

2. Another use of food is to replenish the waste 
that goes on in the body from its daily wear and tear. 
This waste varies with different persons, and with 
the amount of work done. Great workers wear out, 
use up daily several pounds of blood. New food is 
demanded to make good this loss. A month of sick- 
ness sometimes wastes away a third of the weight 
of the body ; but a hearty appetite and food restore 
it to its full size. There are men of powerful frames 
who, if they do hard work, rapidly waste many 
pounds of their avoirdupois, and require muph food 
to replace it. Small workers and lazy, idle people 
eat less ; and there are many corseted and inactive 
young women, and idle young men, who waste little 
of the tissue of the body, and who eat little. It is not 
a bad sign to see healthy people eat heartily ; they 
must do it to work and live. 

3. Another use of food is to maintain the heat of 
the body. So important is this, that it has been 
computed that four-fifths of our nutriment is used 
to maintain a bodily temperature of 98i degrees. 
In order to understand the heat-producing power of 
food, let any one go in cold weather without eating 
for a day and still continue exposing himself to the 
cold, and he will learn that food will warm his body 
more effectually than clothing or fire. 

4. Still another very important use of food is to 
furnish force. This comes in no other way. When 
plants grow they store up the energy of the sun- 
shine, and when we consume these plants this 
energy is transferred to our bodies. It is manifested 
in many ways. First, in the form of motion ; then 
in the form of sensation : feeling, seeing, hearing 
and thinking. Our ability to do any of these things 



A HAPPY ILLUSTRATION. 11 

is conferred by food. The body has the peculiar 
power of abstracting its force from what we eat. 
Go without food, and all these functions of the 
body gradually die away, and life becomes ex- 
tinct. To illustrate. Give a child a hickory bow 
and arrow. He bends the bow on its string, ad- 
justs the arrow and pulls the string back a few 
inches. Now what has he done ? He has stored up 
in the bow a part of the strength of his arm. But 
how did he get that strength ? The sunshine of last 
summer stored it up in the bread and potatoes he 
had eaten. His body has the power to unfasten this 
force and apply it to bending the bow. When he 
lets go of the string the arrow flies away, and that 
force is, so far as he is concerned, spent. The food 
we eat does for us what the coal does for the engine 
on the railroad track, it furnishes the motive power; 
only the body is a complicated living machine and 
can think and feel, which the engine cannot do. 

To recapitulate : we eat, then, to increase the size 
of the body; to supply the waste or loss by its 
daily wear and tear ; to maintain a proper degree 
of warmth and to supply the energy by which to do 
work. 




CHAPTER IL 

CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

The classification of foods is quite simple. All 
the substances used come under one of the follow- 
ing divisions : 

1. Proteids, or albuminous foods. 

2. Fats, sometimes called hydro-carbons. 

3. Amyloids, or carbo-hydrates. 

4. Mineral matter. 

5. Water. 

6. Gaseous food, or air. 

7. Accessory foods, or condiments. 

THE PROTEIDS. 

The proteids are also known as albuminoids and 
nitrogenous substances. Their principle use is to 
construct and repair the active tissues of the body 
and to furnish material out of which to form the 
various digestive fluids, as the saliva of the mouth, 
the gastric juice of the stomach, the bile of the 
liver, and juices of the pancreas. The nerves, the 
muscles and the glands are composed of living mat- 
ter, of protoplasm, and cannot be built up, or the 
glands furnish their secretions without albuminous 
matter. Every structure in the body in which any 
form of force is manifested is mainly built up of 

(13) 



14 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

these proteids. Muscular tissue is a good example; 
the brain cells are also examples. 

The proteids are complex bodies and contain car- 
bon, 53 parts ; oxygen, 21 ; hydrogen, 7 ; nitrogen, 
15, and sulphur 1. The proteids of the body have 
only a slight affinity for oxygen, and, consequently, 
are not readily consumed. They grow old in time 
and decay, but do not burn up. What is known as 
the protoplasm, or living matter of our bodies, is 
composed of proteids, and we all know how living 
matter resists decay and change. 

The principal sources of proteids are the muscu- 
lar parts of animals, eggs of which the white or 
albumen is almost a pure proteid, the gluten of 
grains, the casein or curd of milk and the vegeta- 
ble casein of peas, beans and cereals. 

The proteids are digested in the stomach, this 
organ not digesting either starches or fats. Diges- 
tion makes them very soluble, and they are easily 
taken up through the walls of the digestive organs. 
In their soluble condition they are called peptones 
instead of proteids. If they were to remain soluble 
while in the blood there would be danger of their 
passing out through the kidneys, and so they are 
changed again to proteids in the blood. 

THE FATS. 

The fats are al^o called hydro-carbons. They con- 
tain some oxygen, but never enough to satisfy the 
affinities of the carbon and hydrogen. They are 
powerful generators of heat. An ounce of fat when 
burned produces about two and half times as much 
heat as dry starch or sugar. Some idea of its heat- 
ing properties may be gained by the fact that ten 



FAT AND ANIMAL HEAT. 15 

grains of fat burned will raise the temperature of 
twenty-three pounds of water one degree. This 
would give sufficient force to raise 18,000 pounds 
one foot high. Their uses are to maintain ani- 
mal heat and to generate force. The man who 
does a hard day's work, does so by virtue of the 
fact that he is, so far as his labor is concerned, 
a living engine. The muscles do not furnish 
the strength, they only transmit it. The engine 
does not furnish the power; that comes from the 
steam so highly charged with heat from the burn- 
ing fuel. 

One of its uses is to prevent the loss of animal 
heat. A thick layer of fat is very useful in dimin- 
isliing the chances of catching cold on exposure 
•to drafts ; and where the coating of fat under the 
skin is deficient or absent we must use an additional 
quantity of warmer clothing. A fat person suffers 
less from the cold, other things being equal, than a 
lean one, and does not require so much flannel to 
keep him warm. In very cold latitudes a layer of 
fat under the skin is a useful protection ; but in hot 
climates it becomes oppressive, as we may see by 
observing corpulent persons or fat animals during 
the high heat of summer. In many animals, es- 
pecially those of tropical climates where the sum- 
mer heat is great, although the cold of winter may 
also be considerable, we find that fat, instead of 
being uniformly distributed over the body, is col- 
lected in masses in certain parts, as in the Brahmin 
bull of India, in the yak of Tartary, in the Ameri- 
*can buffalo, as well as in the camel of Africa, on 
whose back a huge lump of fat is found. On a care- 
ful examination of these lumps of fat, especially in 



r 



16 ' CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

a well fed camel, we find them firm and solid, pro- 
jecting upwards ; but at times it appears that they 
lose this firm solidity and become limp, swinging 
from side to side and doubling up like a half empty 
bag. The cause of this is, we are told, that when 
their food is insufficient the hump becomes loose and 
flabby, a large proportion of fat having been ab- 
sorbed. If the animal be kept without food for sev- 
eral days this protuberance almost entirely disap- 
pears. If the animal is well fed again the hump re- 
gains its former size. What has become of this fat? 
Some has undergone combustion to keep up heat, 
while the remainder may have been used to supply 
the waste of some organ of the body. The blood 
contains about one half of one per cent, of fat ; the 
muscles from three to four per cent., and the brain 
eight or nine per cent. The nerves contain much 
more, sometimes as high as 22 per cent. Its use is 
to form a layer around the conducting part to iso- 
late it. Fat may be supplied to the body in many 
ways, especially by fatty foods, starch and sugar. 
These are converted into fat within the organism. 

The fatty parts of the body are not always of the 
same quality. Those accustomed to the fattening 
of animals know that sometimes the fat on them is 
soft and poor, and at others pure and hard, depend- 
ing mainly upon the kind of food they have eaten 
Nurses understand that some foods stick fast, while 
others are fickle and easily squandered. It seems 
that fats laid on rapidly are not so permanent as 
those more slowly acquired. One of the causes of 
consumption is the insufficiency of fat in the body.' 
Either the stomach does not digest enough, or the 
food may be deficient in it. Dr. Hughes Bennett 



DISLIKE FOR FATTY FOOD. 17 

used to tell his students that a frequent cause of 
consumption was the high price of butter and the 
great abundance of pastry cooks. The latter Dr. 
Bennett accused of causing consumption among the 
upper classes by disordering the digestion of young 
girls with pies, pastry and other things that spoil 
their appetites for the more substantial articles of 
food. Many people have a strong dislike to fatty 
foods, and even some physicians have advocated 
that this was a natural instinct ; but the fact that 
there is in the body an arrangement for the diges- 
tion of fatty matter is a strong argument in favor 
of its use in a suitable amount. Dr. Brown says : 
"There are many children who refuse to eat a piece 
of fat meat. They will eat the lean, but cut off the 
fat, and submit to punishment rather than eat it. 
The instinct of the child is perfectly right, and its 
indications are not to be disregarded." Fat swal- 
lowed under compulsion generally disagrees with a 
child and makes it ill. The proper thing to do in 
such cases is to give it in some more agreeable 
form. Nuts contain a sufficient amount of oil ; and 
sweet fruits, abundant in sugar, may to some ex- 
tent supply its place. 

If a lump of butter is swallowed by itself it will 
very likely make one sick, but spread upon bread 
it can be taken without discomfort. The reason of 
this is plain : we get the oily substance in a finer state 
of subdivision, so that it is more easily digested. 
A lump of fat swallowed alone would melt in the 
stomach and float about there without being digest- 
ed, would begin to decompose and yield acrid bodies 
which would irritate the stomach and perhaps cause 
severe headache. When finely comminuted with 



18 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

bread it forms a creamy mass, which passes quickly 
into the duodenum where it is digested. Many a 
child has been made sick by a piece of fat bacon 
swallowed with only a small piece of bread and a 
large piece of butter. 

Fatty foods are most useful in bronchitis, con- 
sumption and nervous diseases. Hard brain work 
uses up a great amount of force, and this is largely 
supplied by the consumption of the fats, starch and 
sugar. A well known English lawyer always takes 
a meal of some easily digested fatty food before 
making a great intellectual effort, and an English 
physician has found that in his intellectual work he 
is best sustained by considerable of the same ma- 
terial. 

We have seen that the nervous system contains 
much fat, and we may imagine that if the food 
is deficient in it the brain will suffer Yery thin 
people are more likely to be nervous than fat 
ones ; and it is said that Bantingism practiced to 
cure corpulency has caused many persons to be- 
come very nervous. It does not follow because fat 
is necessary that people should eat all they can of 
it. It should be taken in reasonable quantities 
and always thoroughly comminuted and mixed 
with other foods which will divide it up into very 
small particles, else it may cause indigestion and 
pass out of the system unabsorbed. Good butter, 
cream, olive oil and nuts are rich in fat, and in a 
form agreeable to take. Potatoes, corn, oatmeal 
and eggs, containing starch, are all fat producers. 
We once advised a boy who rejected every form of 
fat usually found on his mother's table, to eat freely 
of hickory nuts, and it proved to be very good 



FORMULA FOR FOOD. 19 

advice for him. That popular nut, the peanut, 
which even many physicians condemn as indiges- 
tible, has been of like service to others. 

The chemical formula for fat is, carbon 10, hydro- 
gen 18, oxygen 1. Its original source is the vege- 
table kingdom, in which it abounds. Palm oil, 
olive oil, cottonseed oil, flax-seed oil, cocoanut oil, 
peanut oil, etc., are examples. 

Fat is a very concentrated fuel food, and is not in 
any way digested in either the mouth or stomach, 
but in the duodenum, where it is emulsionized, or 
broken up into very minute globules capable of be- 
ing passed through the absorbent vessels. 

Fat often disturbs delicate stomachs, and persons 
with such should choose the most agreeable kind. 

Fat frequently become rancid, and in this state 
is very injurious to the civilized stomach, causing 
dyspepsia, sick headache, heartburn, etc. 

Besides these important and principal functions of 
fat, it has minor uses in the processes of digestion, 
assimilation and nutrition, and, it is believed, in the 
formation of bile. Food digests more readily if a 
certain amount of fat is mixed with it. It also plays 
an important part in the formation of cells, blood 
corpuscles, and even the generation of blood. It is 
present in large quantities in the tubules of the 
nerves, insulating them so that the nervous force is 
not dissipated, but travels along the nerve *to its 
center; and in all the nervous centers serving an 
important function there. 

The distribution of it in every tissue, and its ac- 
cumulation around certain organs, serves to fill up 
the cavities of the body and give roundness to the 
form, equalizing the external pressure diminishing 



20 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

friction; and, by its bad conducting property, re- 
taining animal heat. Fat, therefore, must ever be 
regarded as highly important to the physical devel- 
opment of the body, and any system of diet that 
excludes it is faulty and to be condemned. 

THE AMYLOIDS OR CARBO-HYDRATES. 

This class of foods is best represented by starch 
and sugar. They are called amyloids because this 
word, from the Greek, means resembling starch. 
They are also called carbo-hydrates because chemi- 
cally composed of carbon and water. The chemical 
formula for starch is carbon, 6 ; hydrogen, 10 ; 
oxygen, 5. That of sugar is slightly different ; 
cane sugar being, carbon, 12; hydrogen, 11; oxy- 
gen, 11, and grape sugar being, carbon, 12 ; hydro- 
gen, 12, and oxygen, 12. 

STARCH. 

Starch and sugar have their origin in the veg- 
etable kingdom. Starch abounds in all the grains, 
in rice, in peas and beans, and in the common 
and sweet potato. It is also present in many 
other substances. Starch is insoluble in water, and 
this is a wise provision of nature; otherwise it 
would be easily dissolved by the rains and washed 
out of plants. In its insoluble state it is useless as 
a food, but during the process of digestion it is con- 
verted first into soluble dextrine, which has the 
same chemical formula as grape sugar, and a little 
later into grape sugar itself. The change takes 
place partly in the mouth by the action of the saliva 
during the process of mastication, but owing to the 



SUGAK. 21 

acidity of the gastric juice of the stomach the 
digestion of starch ceases soon after it reaches this 
organ. After the food has been passed into the duo- 
denum, where the secretions are akaline, the diges- 
tion of its starch proceeds very rapidly until it has 
been completely converted into grape sugar, in 
which state it is soluble and easily absorbed. If the 
food has not been properly masticated and mixed 
with saliva in the mouth it is liable to embarrass 
the stomach and cause indigestion ; indeed this is 
one of the most fruitful sources of dyspepsia. On . 
the other hand, if the food has been thoroughly 
masticated and allowed to remain in the mouth 
until it has been converted into a milk-like condi- 
tion, even raw and uncooked starch is so thor- 
oughly changed, as not to disturb the digestion of 
the albuminoids as it goes on in the stomach. 

It is well known that many persons are not able 
to digest the starch of bread. By toasting it, how- 
ever, the heat changes it into dextrine, in the same 
manner as the saliva does. A little more chewing 
would accomplish the same result. 

SUGAR. 

Sugar, although very different in its character and 
nature from starch, is a carbo-hydrate. Sugar may 
be divided into crystaline or cane and into glucose 
or grape sugar. It is the food of young plants and 
is found in all young shoots. It is soluble and does 
not need to be digested ; but it is believed tha,t cane 
sugar is converted into grape sugar in the alimen- 
tary canal. Experiments made by Sir William 
Roberts, M. D., go to show that considerable sugar 



22 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

in food taken into a healthy stomach does not re- 
tard digestion. 

The carbo-hydrates form a most important part of 
our food and are contained in nearly everything we 
eat. They are fuel foods and supply animal heat. 
They are also, like fats, an important source of the 
force or strength of the body.

From this it will be seen that fat is more than 
twice as valuable a heat-producing agent as starch. 

There is also the same difference in the amount 
of work these substances will accomplish when 
burned, as the following table will show :

MINERAL MATTER. 

We read in the Bible that God created man out 
of the dust of the earth. Whether this is to be in- 
terpreted literally or figuratively I leave to theolo- 



ONE ORGAN DIFFERS FROM ANOTHER. 23 

gians to decide. For the scientist it has plainly a 
symbolical significance. The materials of whicli 
our bodies are composed are partly earthy, and it 
is not possible to think of them as composed with- 
out earthy substances. We call these constituents 
salts, and if they were not present in our food life 
could hardly be continued as at present. 

There is a very simple method by which any one 
can obtain the salts of any organism. We have 
but to burn that body and most of them remain 
as ashes. Whatever belongs to the organice world 
flies off in vapor and smoke. The same result is 
reached by the slow process of decomposition. The 
salts remain while the organic part of the organ- 
ism escapes into the atmosphere. 

Only a limited number of minerals take part in the 
formation of our bodies. Each organ has a com- 
position of its own. The same parts in different 
men and animals are of nearly the same composi- 
tion, but one organ differs from another in a slight 
degree. The bones, the hearts, the stomachs of all 
animals are nearly the same, but the composition 
of the heart and stomach in the same person differs. 

These facts prove the great importance of the 
mineral matter of our food. Had each organ the 
same composition a less variety of mineral matter 
would suffice ; but as each demands a special salt 
for itself there must be considerable variety. In 
one organ is needed the salts of potash ; in another, 
those of soda or phosphorus. Another reason for 
variety is the fact that the processes of osmose 
and endosmose, or the exchange of fluids inside 
and outside the cells, depend largely on the fact 
that the constituents of the fluids on one side of 



24 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

the walls of these structures differ from those on 
the other side. Without this difference no change, 
or scarcely any, would take place, and the growth 
and nutrition of each part would come to a stand- 
still for want of new and appropriate material. 

Professor Forster, of Munchen, has made a large 
number of experiments to discover the importance 
of mineral matter in our food. Two pigeons were 
taken for one experiment and fed on food contain- 
ing every other requisite : albumen, carbo-hydrates, 
etc., but entirely freed from all mineral matter. 
These pigeons took their food regularly, but soon 
lost all their liveliness and sat dumb and motion- 
less on the bars of their cages. After the tenth day 
they ate but little and lost in flesh. On the twenty- 
fourth day one of them had a fit, and both refused 
to eat. He then fed them by compulsion. One 
died on the twenty-sixth day by a return of the fit, 
and the other lived on to the thirty-first day, when 
it also had a fit from which it did not recover. An 
examination of the bodies of the pigeons revealed 
no traces of any disturbance of digestion. 

He then took a dog and fed him in the same man- 
ner. He soon showed signs of weariness, lay sad 
and dull in his corner, had sudden fits as of mad- 
ness, became weak and uncertain in his motions, 
trembled and showed signs of nervousness, became 
weaker and weaker till he could scarcely crawl, 
and still there was no disturbance in the digestion 
of his food. 

Another pigeon was taken and fed on food free 
from mineral matter by compulsion. It died in 
thirteen days, and yet an examination of its body 
showed that it had been well nourished and the 



EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS. 25 

organs were sound. The food had apparently been 
well digested. The absence of mineral matter had 
not prevented digestion until after several days, 
but had caused death. The animals had all shown 
muscular weakness and trembling, and in one case 
a sort of paralysis, as if the spinal cord and brain had 
been affected. The nervous system suffered most; in- 
deed, it was apparent that the nervous weakness 
was caused by the absence of mineral salts, and we 
must from this look on them as necessary to excite 
and enliven the brain and nerves, and especially 
promote nutrition and secretion. We know that 
living a long time on pickled meat, salt pork or 
corned beef causes a sort of scurvy which is only 
cured by the use of fresh vegetables and fruit. 
Now, the brine used to preserve the flesh has the 
power to draw from the meat if s mineral constitu- 
ents which the fresh vegetables replace. 

Dr. Forster's investigations gave one other re- 
sult. He found that the animals fed by compulsion 
on food freed from its mineral matter died sooner 
than those not fed at all. The explanation he gives 
for this is, that if no food is given the body is nour- 
ished on itself, and, consequently, a supply of min- 
eral matter is obtained from the decomposed flesh 
of the body ; but when nourished on food free from 
salts there is no demand from the body for albumen 
and carbo-hydrates, and so no mineral matter is 
received from its decomposition. The salts of our 
food are more necessary to the growing organ- 
ism than for the adult. They may be divided into 
two kinds— the fixed and the non-fixed. The for- 
mer includes those firmly united to the tissues of 

2 



26 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

the bones ; the latter those dissolved and circulating 
in the blood. 

The excess of salts does not make tissues richer 
, in them, because this excess is excreted almost im- 
mediately, except, perhaps, in the case of persons 
advanced in years, whose powers of excretion are 
weakened and wlw)se lime salts may accumulate in 
excess and cause harm. 

Let us now turn our attention to the salts which 
are found in our tissues. We find the following 
always present : potash, soda, lime, magnesia and 
iron. In part these minerals are in union with 
chlorine and in part with carbonic acid, but most- 
ly with phosphorus acid. In the bones the lime 
salts are more abundant and important. For 
the other organs the potash and soda salts are 
necessary. Especially important are the potash 
salts for the muscular tissues ; for the serum of the 
blood the soda salts are most important. In the 
blood corpuscles potash salts and iron are predomi- 
nant. Scarcely a trace of potash is found in the 
serum of the blood. These subtances are all de- 
rived from our food and drink ; the only one added 
artificially is chloride of soda, or common salt. 
This, too, is found in the food, but, apparently, in 
quantities too small for the requirements of the 
system. 

The bones are built mainly of phosphate of lime, 
phosphate of magnesia and carbonate of lime ; the 
former constituting the principal part of their 
earthy constituents. The phosphoric acid and pot- 
ash constitute an essential mineral element of the 
juices of the flesh and are dissolved in them. One 
may notice on cooked beef a white incrustation 



EXPERIMENTS ON LAMBS. 27 

over its surface when it comes to the table. This is 
the phosphate of magnesia, formed by a union of 
the phosphoric acid in the flesh with the lime and 
magnesia in the water in which the meat has 
been boiled. 

Phosphoric acid is the most abundant of all the 
minerals of the body, and it is also most abundant 
in the food of the vegetable-eating animals. 

Experiments have been made to discover if one 
salt might be substituted for another in the body, 
but without success. Three growing lambs were 
taken for this experiment. One was fed on food 
deficient in phosphoric acid, another on food defi- 
cient in lime, and a third was fed normally. The first 
two became emaciated and at the end of twenty- 
four days were near their end, when all three were 
slaughtered. There was no great difference in 
the composition of the bones of any of them, only 
this : those of the poorly fed animals were less rich 
in fat and less perfectly developed. 

In some parts of Germany no water is given to 
children until it has been boiled to kill the germs of 
any disease present. This practice has certain ad- 
vantages and certain disadvantages for the poor, 
where food is not abundant. The boiling water de- 
posits on the kettle its lime, and this is a loss of so 
much mineral matter. It kills the germs, which is 
beneficial. If the child is suitably fed no harm is 
done, but a positive benefit ; but if not well fed it is 
a loss to the bones to lose the lime in the water. 
Pure, fresh water from springs does not contain 
germs, and if it is used there is no advantage in 
boiling it. This objection would not have any force 
in our country where food is so abxindant. 



28 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

Let us now look at the potash and soda salts. 
Potash is a very remarkable material; phosphate 
of potash is an essential constituent of the muscles 
and also of the blood corpuscles. In the serum of 
the blood, however, it is an abnormal constituent, 
causing paralysis of the heart, and frequently sud- 
den death. One may, without especial danger, take 
chlorate or carbonate of potash through the stcfen- 
ach, as is often the case by prescriptions of phy- 
sicians. The same dose, or even a less one, how- 
ever, introduced directly into the circulation causes 
death. A dog has been killed instantly by the in- 
jection of only one decigramme of the chlorate of 
potash into an artery. 

Bunge experimented on dogs with flesh extract 
and found that, according to the size of the ani- 
mal, a dose of from 15 to 25 grammes was deadly. 
Now, 25 grammes of flesh extract contain 2.5 
grammes of phosphate of potash, and 2.3 grammes 
of this substance given to a dog caused death, ac- 
companied by the same symptoms as with 25 
grammes of flesh extract. Johannus Ranke says 
that potash is a substance which, if it accumulates 
in the flesh cells or nerve cells, causes irritation of 
the muscles and paralysis of the nerves. 

We find here a riddle. How is it that this material 
is a necessary constituent of the firm material of our 
bodies, but so deadly in the serum of our blood ? Dr. 
Bunge suggests that the potash and soda-salts neu- 
tralize each other, as is the case when mixed in the 
laboratory, and allowed to crystalize, new unions 
being formed, one being chlorate of potash and the 
other carbonate of soda. 

Another fact comes to light in this investigation, 



WHY SALT IS NECESSARY. 20 

that the plant-eating animals require more common 
salt than the flesh-eating ones. Some of them are 
so greedy for salt that they visit salt licks to obtain 
it, which is never the case with carnivorous animals. 
Now, if we compare the food of the flesh-eaters 
with that of the herbivora we find about the same 
amount of chloride of soda (common salt), but the 
amount of potash salts in the food of vegetable- 
eating animals is from two to four times as great. 
Bunge suggests that the reason why the vegetable- 
eaters require more salt is to neutralize the great 
excess of potash salts, which we have seen may be 
very injurious ; or may not the potash draw so 
heavily on the chloride of soda in the body as to 
make the addition of it in our food necessary in 
order to maintain the equilibrium of the body ? In 
order to test this question scientifically, Bunge 
made an experiment on liimself. First, he ate food 
for ^ye days with such exactness as to bring the 
excretion of the salts to a regular and constant 
amount. On the fifth day he added to his food 
eighteen grammes of phosphate of potash. Al- 
though he had not added any chloride of soda there 
was not only an immediate increase of excretion of 
potash salts, but of soda salts also. Repeated ex- 
periments gave the same results. He estimated 
that by the addition of twelve grammes of potash 
salts to the food, nearly half of the soda salts of 
the blood would be extracted. This, he thinks, 
proved his hypothesis. Potash in small quantities 
withdraws from the body chlorine and soda, both 
constituents of common salts, and this requires 
the addition of it to our food. 
We will now compare a f e^" principal articles of 



30 



CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 



food and see the relative amount of potash and soda 
salts therein ; and see, also, how deficient some of 
them are in soda, and how excessive is the potash 
in others.

From this it may be seen at a glance that all veg- 
etables contain less soda than milk; and they all 
contain, rice excepted, more potash than this arti- 
cle. If potash, as shown by Bunge, withdraws so- 
da from the body, it may be seen that the addition 
of common salt to the food poor in soda is a scien- 
tific necessity. 

We also see why a babe nourished on its mother's 
milk does not require the addition of common salt. 
Its food contains less potash salts and more soda 
salts than almost any other article of food. 

Liebig remarked that there seemed to be a popu- 
lar instinct to add more salt to those articles of food 
which were rich in starch, as, for instance, wheat 
meal, peas and beans, and it seems that these are 
the very ones which contain most potash. 

Let us now look at this subject from another 
standpoint, and assume that only 100 grammes of 
albumen is necessary daily for the maintenance of 
the body, and if we estimate the amount of potash

in the different kinds of food necessary to furnish 
them would contain, we have the following : 

Rice 1.24 grammes. 

Wheat and Rye . . 2.-4.5 "

Barley .... 4.9-5.39 " 

Cow's Milk . . . 4.4-4.7 " 

Woman's Milk . . 4.8-5.3 " 

Potatoes .... 42. " 

We see that rice is very deficient in potash and 
soda. One who nourished himself on it would never 
suffer from an excess of potash salts, for it would 
not withdraw from the hody soda and chlorine. 
And it may be remembered that rice food can be 
eaten and enjoyed without salt. Junghuhm states 
that whole nations of rice-eating people take this 
food without salt, and only with the addition of 
pepper. It is true that Europeans and Americans 
do not relish rice without this condiment. It is 
not a physiological necessity, however, but a habit 
which induces its use. 

On the other hand, how would it be with a per- 
son living on potatoes ? He would take daily forty- 
two grammes of potash, or over thirty times more 
than he who lived on rice. We said previously that 
twelve grammes of potash were sufficient to with- 
draw half the soda from the blood. How, then, 
with 42 grammes ? And in practice we know that 
large quantities of salt is a physiological necessity 
for those who live mainly on potatoes. 

In this connection it may be remarked that pot- 
ash salts in large quantities affect unfavorably the 
mucus membrane of the digestive tract, and es- 
pecially the stomach. Consequently, all those who 



32 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

suffer from weakness of the stomach should avoid 
potatoes and substitute rice instead. Rice is also 
more easily digested than potatoes for other rea- 
sons. It contains less cellular, or woody and indi- 
gestible matter, enclosing the starch cells. 

One writer on food (Mulder) goes so far in his 
opposition to potatoes as an article of diet, as to de- 
clare it would be a blessing to the race to banish 
them from the planet and substitute rice instead. 

Dr. Bunge has collected facts concerning the use 
of salt among various people. He finds that those 
who live mainly on flesh, as hunters, fishermen and 
nomadic tribes, do not care for salt. Of the Samoy- 
den he says: *'They know nothing of bread and 
but little of roots. Flesh and fish constitute their 
daily food. The use of salt is unknown though easi- 
ly attainable from the sea. The Tungusen eat no 
raw flesh, but cook it in fresh water and use no salt 
on it. The Dolganen and Juralkan, in North Sibe- 
ria, possess many salt mines, but they never use 
salt, unless as a medicine. Their food is fish and 
reindeer flesh." 

Wrange writes concerning the Tschuktschen : 
*' Their food is flesh, and they use no salt, but have 
actual repugnance to it." 

Prof. Schwartz lived in the land of the Tungu- 
sen three years ; lived on the flesh of wild birds 
and reindeer without the addition of salt, and felt 
no need for it. 

There are tribes of flesh-eating men in both tro- 
pical Indies and Africa who use no salt ; they even 
laugh at those who do use it. 

On the other hand, most of the native tribes of 
Africa cultivate the soil. Mungo Park says ; *' The 



AFRICAN CRAVING FOR SALT. 33 

Mandigos breakfast early on a porridge made of 
meal and water, flavored with the rind of tamarind 
to give it relish. About two they eat a meal con- 
sisting of pudding made of corn meal, milk and 
vegetable butter. Their chief meal is eaten late at 
night, and consists of broth made with corn meal, 
wheat meal with vegetables, with sometimes a little 
flesh and vegetable butter. They are principally 
vegetarians." Concerning salt, he says: **They 
have a great craving for it. If a child gets a piece 
of rock salt from a European it eats it as our chil- 
dren do sugar. The poor classes look upon a man 
who can afford salt as a rich man." Park's own 
experience was that he had a painful craving for 
salt which could not be described. On the west 
coast of Africa a man would sell his wife or child 
for salt. A war for a salt spring between different 
tribes is not uncommon. To them salt is no luxury, 
but a necessity. On the other hand, it cannot be 
denied that many persons who have adopted a wise, 
nutritious vegetable diet, consisting largely of nuts, 
fruit and grains, either partially or with, perhaps, 
eggs and milk, abstain from salt, as they believe, 
to advantage, and it is pretty certain that a major- 
ity of people consume far too much of it, more as 
a condiment than to meet physiological needs. 
Something yet has to be learned on this import- 
ant subject. 

Many of the facts and statements of this chapter 
are drawn from German sources, and especially 
from a little work entitled, *^Die Modernen Prin- 
cipien der Ernahrung," nach v. Pettenkofer and 
Yoit, von Dr. Aug. Guckerson, a most valuable 
little work, putting in popular language the scien-

34 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

tific experiments of the most learned German stu- 
dents of man's food — a subject now attracting more 
attention than at any former time. 

WATER. 

Water is a liquid food. It constitutes a part of 
every tissue, in a free, loose state, and a part of it 
in a very intimate union with the tissues, so that it 
cannot be driven off by evaporation. When water 
is taken into the system, it assists in building up 
the organs and repairing them when worn out. 

Water is the natural beverage of man. About 
eighty-seven per cent, of our bodies is water. It 
wastes with every breath and motion, and this 
waste must be restored with a fresh supply. 

It softens and holds in solution the solid part of 
our foods so, that it will jBlow in the veins and 
arteries. 

It maintains a proper bulk to both blood and tis- 
sues, rendering them mobile and soft instead of 
dry and hard. 

It holds in solution the waste matter of the body, 
and transports it out of the system. 

It takes up the waste heat of the body, and carries 
it away. 

It slacks our thirst, and cools the blood in warm 
weather. 

It may be the vehicle, taken hot, of carrying 
heat into the circulation after exposure to cold 
and damp. 

AMOUNT OF WATER REQUIRED FOR MEN AND 

WOMEN. 

An adult requires daily from three to six pints of 
water for nutrition. Not far from one-third of this 



AMOUNT OF WATER REQUIRED. 35 

is contained in our food, and if much fruit is used, 
the amount required for drink is less. Women 
drink less than men, and children more in propor- 
tion to their bulk. During hot weather and when 
the exercise is very severe an additional supply is 
required. 

AMOUNT OF WATER REQUIRED FOR ANIMALS. 

Some experiments were made in English cavalry 
stables, in 1866, to determine the amount of water 
required, daily, for horses. It seemed from the 
report, that these animals vary in the quantity con- 
sumed as much as man ; this variation depending 
upon the food, the weather, and the amount of 
exercise taken. If a horse is allowed free access to 
water at all times, he will drink on an average from 
six to ten gallons daily. 

Dr. Parks found a horse, sixteen hands high, 
whose work was to draw a carriage eight miles 
each day, fed on hay and corn, that drank seven 
and a half gallons per day. Some stabled caval- 
ry horses, used only enough for exercise, drank 
six and a half gallons daily, during the autumn 
months. In hot and dusty weather they required 
more. A cow or an ox, kept on dry food, will 
drink six or eight gallons daily; and a sheep or 
pig from one half a gallon to a gallon. 

In the Abyssinian Expedition, the daily expendi- 
ture for water for animals on ship-board was as fol- 
lows : Elephants, 26 gallons ; camels, 10 ; large ox- 
en, 6 ; small oxen, 5 ; mules and ponies, 5. 

AMOUNT REQUIRED FOR THE SICK. 

The sick require more water than the well, be- 
cause so much is needed for washing and bathing ; 



36 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

but no very accurate experiments have been made 
regarding the amount required for drinking pur- 
poses. It would probably be less than for active 
healthy persons. 

PUKITY OF WATER. 

Perfectly pure water does not exist in nature. 
The nearest approach to it is distilled water. The 
best natural waters contain some salts of lime, 
magnesia, atmospheric air, carbonic acid, and other 
substances, and many contain in solution, organic 
and inorganic matter enough to render their use 
objectionable. Water that contains much lime and 
magnesia is called hard water, and conveys to the 
blood substances which interfere with the most 
perfect action of the organs of the body. Water 
containing organic raatter dissolved from vege- 
table and animal substances, or poisonous gases 
dissolved from the air, is a very dangerous drink, 
to be avoided under all circumstances. Water 
contaminated with malarial germs is a source of 
malarial fever, and it is a question if this disease 
is not caused by drinking water quite as often as 
by breathing the air of malarious districts. Water 
contaminated by matter from cesspools, privies and 
barn-yards, is a common source of typhoid fever. 
There is no doubt but the unclean water about 
many farms and dairies spreads disease in healthy 
towns, and causes much loss of life. 

DISTILLED WATER. 

In diseases, distilled water may be an important aid 
to recovery. It can be made by the use of apparatus, 
which need not be troublesome or inconvenient. 



GASEOUS FOOD. 37 

Druggists generally keep it for preparing medi- 
cines. Comparatively pure water may be made by 
boiling, cooling and straining it through a pan of 
charcoal, and keeping in a well-corked bottle in a 
cool, dark place. 

GASEOUS FOOD. 
THE ATMOSPHERE. 

The atmosphere is the only gaseous food required 
by man ; and the necessity for its oxygen is absolute 
and continuous. The nitrogen of the atmosphere, 
so far as is known, plays only the part of a dilutent, 
and does not enter into any important chemical 
combination within the body. 

When the mixed gases of the air are drawn into 
the lungs, a portion of the oxygen is absorbed by 
the blood, and, during the course of the circulation, 
unites chemically with the carbon, nitrogen, and 
hydrogen of our food — forming chemical com- 
pounds, generally called carbonates, nitrates and 
hydrates. Some of these compounds go to form a 
part of the substance of the body; but the greater 
proportion of them, after producing heat, leave it as 
carbonic acid and water. 

From the stand point of a chemist, the living 
body is a great oxidizing machine, constantly burn- 
ing up its own substance. If the process of this 
combustion could be seen it would perhaps resemble 
the glow seen on the firefly in it^ nocturnal flight, 
but this we can only conjecture. It is a very safe 
statement to make that, so far as we know, every 
act of man, and each unconscious change within 
his body is accompanied by a consumption of oxy- 



'dH CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS.'- 

gen. The quantity of air consumed, when com- 
pared with the amount of other food, is very con- 
siderable — the average for adults being 360 cubic 
feet every day — about 2,000 gallons; which would 
weigh not far from twenty-five pounds. 

Though fresh air is abundant in nature and costs 
nothing, yet it cannot be doubted that a large num- 
ber of persons, especially sedentary ones and those 
who spend a large portion of their time in-doors, 
have their health injured, their working capacity 
diminished, and their length of days shortened by 
an insufficiency of air. They literally starve for 
this form of food. 

The amount of fresh air required hourly in tem- 
perate climates, from which to draw the amount 
required for actual consumption, has been variously 
estimated by hygienists. General Morin, of Paris, 
published some results of his own experiments and 
observations on this subject which are worth re- 
peating. Work-shops, prisons and theaters require 
2,118 cubic feet hourly for each person; schools, 
1,059 cubic feet; hospitals at ordinary times, 2,825 
cubic feet; during operations, 4,236, and during 
epidemics 5,650 cubic feet. I am of the opinion that 
Morin's estimates are too low, and that not less than 
7,000 cubic feet should be provided hourly for each 
person. This will keep the carbonic acid and other 
impurities which emanate from the body down to 
nearly the same amount as in out-of-door air. 

It has been found that in mines, if it is wished to 
keep up the energies of the workmen to their full 
capacity, not less than 100 cubic feet per minute 
for each man is necessary, and if the quantity be re- 
duced one third or one half there is a correspond- 



ACCESSORY FOODS. 39 

ing falling off of the w®rk done by the men. Ro- 
bert Stephenson is of the opinion that 100 cubic 
feet is not sufficient. The best physicians now 
agree that in fevers and contagious diseases the 
more complete exposure of the patients to the at- 
mosphere the better, and that fresh air is of more 
importance than medicine. I asked a young phy- 
sician connected with one of the hospitals, the 
other day, what was the latest method of treating 
pneumonia. He replied, ** Exposure to cool fresh 
air;" and then he added, '' We recently had thirty- 
four cases in one hospital, and lost but one." I 
asked if there was no danger in cold weather of in- 
jury from cold, and he said that under proper pre- 
cautions there was not the least danger. 

I can not go into any detailed account of the ques- 
tion of air and its purity, or of ventilation, here. 
The subject is treated elaborately in works on Hy- 
giene; but I may add, that the condition of the 
atmosphere varies with every hour of the day, with 
every change of temperature and pressure, with 
every change of wind and season, with every de- 
gree of latitude and longitude, and with all those 
multitudinous conditions constantly taking place 
on our globe; and I may also add that, notwith- 
standing the fact that Nature has supplied us with 
it in the greatest abundance, we need after all, to 
pay constant attention to its purity, to ventilation, 
and all those matters which will help us to receive 
it in abundance and purity. 

ACCESSORY FOODS. 
Accessory foods do not contain any appreciable 
amount of nourishment, but act as condiments, 



40 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

stimulating the digestive organs, promoting the 
flow of saliva, gastric juice and other internal se- 
cretions, and increasing the peristaltic movement 
of the viscera. They are used to improve the taste 
of whatever is eaten, so as to make it more enjoy- 
able, or to stimulate the nervous system to an in- 
creased activity. 

A few of the accessory foods may be mentioned : 
Tea and coffee ; every form of alcoholic beverage, 
as wine and beer ; spices of all sorts used in the 
culinary art, and vinegar, mustard, horseradish, 
pickles, etc., etc. Salt has generally been regarded 
as a condiment also ; but recent investigations go 
to show that while it possesses some of the proper- 
ties of this class of foods it is, in fact, to a certain 
extent, a food itself ; or, at least, its presence is a 
necessity in the blood. 

There is a marked difference of opinion on the 
value and usefulness of accessory foods between 
various authorities. Pettenkoffer says: ''Acces- 
sory foods (Genussmittel) are true friends of man. 
They help the organism over many difficulties. I 
might compare them to the oil used to lubricate 
miachinery which, while it cannot be substituted 
for the steam power, causes every movement to go 
easier, without friction, and more smoothly than it 
otherwise would." 

But, on the other hand, many of our condiments 
may very justly be classed as drugs or medicines, 
and their habitual use by healthy persons, it re- 
quires but little intelligence to know, must be in- 
jurious. Their influence is mainly on the nervous 
system. Now, in a state of health, and especially 
with the young, the nervous system does not re*

quire a spur constantly applied to make it do its 
work. When age advances, if the constitution has 
been injured, perhaps this rule might be relaxed. 
W. Mattieu Williams, in his admirable work upon 
the Chemistry of Cookery takes the same view that 
I do, and says : *^ Cayenne pepper may be selected 
as a typical example of a condiment. Mustard is a 
food and a condiment combined. This is the case 
with some others. Curry powders are a mixture of 
very potent condiments with more or less of farin- 
aceous materials and sulphur compounds, which, 
like the oil of mustard, onions, garlic, etc., may 
have a certain amount of nutritive value. The 
mere condiment is a stimulating drug, which does 
its work directly upon the inner lining of the stom- 
ach, exciting it to increased abnormal, activity. 

*^The dyspeptic may obtain immediate relief by 
the use of cayenne pepper. Among the patent 
medicines is a pill of the very ominous name of its 
compounder — the chief constituent of which is 
cayenne. Great relief and temporary comfort are 
commonly obtained by using it as a dinner pill. If 
thus used, only as a temporary remedy for an acute 
and temporary or exceptional attack of indigestion, 
all is well ; but whether cayenne is taken in pills, 
or dusted over the food, or stewed with it in curries 
or otherwise, it is one of the most cruel of slow poi- 
sons when taken habitually. /Thousands of poor 
wretches are crawling miserably towards their 
graves — the victims of the multitude of maladies 
of both mind and body, that are connected with 
chronic, incurable dyspepsia ; all brought about by 
the. habitual use-- of cayenne ahii'lts^ condimental 
cousins. 



42 CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 

"The usual history of these victims is that they 
began by over-feeding, took to the condiment to 
force the stomach to do more than its healthful 
amount of work, using but a little at first. Then 
the stomach became tolerant of this little and de- 
manded more, until at last inflammation, ulcera- 
tion, torpidity, and the final death of the digestive 
powers, accompanied by all of that long train of 
miseries to which I have referred." 

This is strong language, but it has much truth in 
it. It has always seemed to me that those condi- 
ments which are of a very stimulating, and, per- 
haps, of a poisonous nature, are not required, and 
if used to any great extent are positively injurious 
to the young and to persons in good health, and 
that if our food is properly cooked all its natural 
properties preserved and brought out, the demands 
of the palate and of digestion would be sufiiciently 
served to answer our natural requirements. If the 
material of our food is not good, if the cooking is 
bad, we must conceal its disagreeable qualities by 
condiments. 

Many eschew condiments entirely, and to mani- 
fest advantage. William Cullen Bryant, in a letter 
written for The Herald of Health, said: '^Even 
with my food I do not take the usual condiments, 
such as pepper and the like." 

Other accessory foods, such as tea, coffee, etc., 
will be discussed in the chapter on drinks. 



CHAPTER III. 
THE DAILY REQUIREMENTS OF THE BODY. 

Before considering the daily requirements of our 
bodies it will be necessary to know what is expected 
of them, or what they are capable of accomplishing. 
To this end we need a mathematical form of ex- 
pression for the work which an average human be- 
ing is able to perform daily. To secure this we 
must first convert the various kinds of labor into a 
common unit. This unit, as has been agreed upon 
by physiologists, is a foot-ton, or 2000 pounds raised 
one foot high, The number of foot-tons which can 
be lifted daily would constitute a day's work. 

There are, however, two kinds of work done by 
the body : one is internal work, such as circulating 
the blood, respiration, secretion, digestion, and all 
other kinds of labor except muscular. The other 
kind is known as external work, concerning which 
Dr. Alexander Wynter Blythe, in a little book en- 
titled ''Diet in its Relation to Health and Work," 
says : *' The external work varies much. A country 
postman, 150 pounds in weight, walking his daily 
round of twenty miles, would do work equal to 353.4 
foot-tons. Ordinary day laborers, such as we see 
on the road, probably average 350 foot-tons. In the 
case of a peddler, cited by Parks, who carried twen^ 

(43) 



44 THE DAILY REQUIREMENTS OF THE BODY. 

ty-eight pounds on his back and walked twenty 
miles daily, the work was 419.5 foot-tons. 

*'In Weston's feat of fifty miles a day, I have 
calculated his daily work to be no less than 793 
foot-tons ; but this large number was exceeded in a 
former feat, in which he walked 317 miles in five 
days, which would give, approximately, 1,010 foot- 
tons daily. 

'^ A very hard day's work for most men is 400 foot- 
tons. At the other end of the scale stand sedentary 
occupations, for example : needlewomen, the ex- 
ternal work of which may fall as low as seventeen 
or eighteen foot-tons." 

The internal work done by the body can only be 
estimated approximately. The most reliable cal- 
culations have been made of the work of the heart. 
The left ventricle at each pulsation, in an average 
man, circulates about six ounces of blood. 

The right ventricle circulates the same quantity, 
but to a less distance ; and its labor has been esti- 
mated at about one-third of that of the left ventri- 
cle. According to nice calculations, the work of 
both ventricles amounts to about 435 foot-tons daily, 
which is more than the entire external work of an 
average laborer. 

Of the internal work done by other orgarns of the 
body we have no reliable data. 

The estimates given by different authorities as to 
the daily requirements of the body have an inter- 
est, though they are somewhat arbitrary. They are 
made to suit the average laboring man, whose diges- 
tion is good and who does a fair day's muscular 
work, and are no criterion for sedentary persons or 
for women. 



CONSTITUENTS OF A SUFFICIENT DIET. 45 

According to Ranke a sufficient diet for the aver- 
age worker, estimated dry, should contain. 

; about 1,543 grains, or 3.3 ounces of proteids, 

" 1,543 " '' 3.3 " ** fats, 
and 3,703 " ** 7.88 " *♦ carbohydrates. 

The amount of energy associated with each of 
those groups of food constituents is shown in the 
next table. 

1,543 grains of albumin give 430,300 calories, 
1,543 '♦ " fat ** 000,900 ** 

3,703 " ** starch '* 938,880 ** 



. Total, 2,373,980 calories. 

Foster and Voit make a more liberal and some- 
what different estimate, of man's daily require- 
ments, as follows : 

Albumin 1,820 grains, 3.8 ounces, 

Fats 1,930 " 4 *' 

Carbohydrates 6,053 ** 12.G ** 

The quantity of nitrogen and carbon in the above 
diet is as follows : 

Nitrogen • • • . 283.40 grains. 
Carbon . . . .5,061 ** 

The value of a diet containing this amount of the 
various constituents in energy is as follows : 

1,830 grains albumia give 503,034 calories, 

1,364 '* fat " 801,699 '* 

5,053 ** carbohydrates '' 1,534,600 " 



Total, 3,838,333 calories. 

Professor Gamgee, in his interesting work on 
*'Food and Digestion," gives in the following table 
the quality of the different foods which a man

would be required to eat in order to supply his 
system \^ ith the nitrogen and carbon specified in 
the last table quoted, as follows :

Beer ..... 13,160 ** 

These tables have no absolute value as guides to 
our daily diet, but are curiosities which will inter- 
est the reader, and they 'indicate,'' continues Gam- 
gee, ** how very limited are the substances which 
alone will supply the body with the proper quanti- 
ties which it requires of nitrogen and of carbon, and 
also of energy. Thus, whilst 538 grammes of meat 
are sufficient to supply all the proteid which the 
body requires, if meat alone composed the diet of 

♦To convert grammes Into avoir, ounces multiply by 0.0353. 




BLACK BOT7^^i=^^='=**^ 47 



man there would be needed as much as 2,620 
grammes to supply all the carbon required ; but no 
man could day after day consume such a great 
quantity of meat. Even milk, which contains all 
the various groups of food constituents, is not 
adapted to supply all the elements of a perfect 
diet in their proper proportions for an adult man ; 
for while all the nitrogen which the body needs 
could be afforded by the consumption of 2,905 
grammes of milk, in order that the amount of 
carbon required should be obtained, the milk con- 
sumed would have to reach the enormous amount 
of 4,652 grammes, in other words, over ten English 
pounds. 

It will be observed that there is only one article 
of diet in each of these tables, namely, black bread, 
which contains nitrogen and carbon in such pro- 
portions that a moderate weight of it is able to 
supply the wants of the economy for both these 
elements. From 1,300 to 1,400 grammes of black 
bread constitute, therefore, almost a standard diet, 
and it may be mentioned that upon this diet large 
numbers of men are able to live in health and to 
accomplish great labors. In some of the depart- 
ments in the south of France black bread consti- 
tutes almost the only food of a vigorous and labor- 
ious population." 

A receipt will be given for making this black 
bread in another department. While it contains 
the elements of an almost perfect nutrition it is 
very disagreeable to the taste and also difficult of 
digestion. Only those working in the open air can 
digest it. 

Dr. Edward Smith made inquiries into the food

' These tables are all constructed from English and 
German data, where work of this kind has been 
done much more extensively than in our own coun- 
try. There are evidences, however, that American 
scientists will soon give us statistics of this sort of 
the most valuable kind. On this point Professor 
Atwater says : 

'^I think that to fairly meet the demand of the 
average American laboring man (I mean the man 
whose labor is done with his muscles ; brain-work- 



LIBERAL RATIONS FOR HARD WORK. 49 

ers who have little muscular exercise need less 
food, I suppose,) a more liberal allowance than Voit 
makes for laboring men in Germany is needed. 
The American ''working-man" is better paid, has 
more and better food, and does more work than 
his European brother. I should be inclined to quan- 
tities more like the following for the nutrients in 
the daily food of an average man doing manual 
work *. 

Protein. Fat. Carbohydrates. 

For moderate work. 
125 grammes (4.4 ozs). 125 grammes. 400 grammes (14.4 ozs). 

For hard work. 
150 grammes 150 grammes. 400 grammes. 

*'Men at very severe work may often need much 
more than the most liberal of these rations allows, 
while men, and especially women, of sedentary hab- 
its and elderly people are believed to usually require 
considerably less than the smallest figures indi- 
cate. 

*' Statistics collected in the United States imply 
that the quantity of food consumed by many people 
whose occupations involve only light muscular labor 
approaches very near to the largest of these stand- 
ards, and often considerably exceeds it. Indeed, a 
large array of facts lately gathered very strongly 
support the teaching of physicians that the failure 
to fit the food to the demands of the body, and es- 
pecially the excessive consumption of certain kinds 
of food, are the sources of untold injury to health 
and happiness." 

Those who are fond of figures will be interested 
in Professor Huxley's general statistics of the body, 
as follows :

Such a body would lose in 24 hours — of water, 
about 40,000 grains, or 6 lbs. ; of other matters, about

matters, 400 grains; and would part, per diem, with 
as much heat as would raise 8,700 lbs. of water

tons. Such a body ought to do as much work as is 
equal to 450 foot-tons.

CHAPTER IV. 

DIGESTION. 

Good digestion is at the base of perfect nutrition. 
The best food in the world, imperfectly digested, 
will not be so useful to the animal body as the 
poorest food well digested. But the digestion of no 
animal is quite perfect. If it were, then the excre- 
ment which passes away would not contain undi- 
gested sustances. Now this is not the case. The 
excrements of all animals furnish food for multi- 
tudes of insects, and birds feed with avidity on the 
dung of grain-fed horses and cattle, as farmers well 
know. The fireman who shovels coal under the 
boiler of a steam engine knows full well that he 
must furnish an extra supply, above that theoreti- 
cally required. Hardly more than twenty-five per 
cent, of its real value is utilized by the best mechan- 
ism yet constructed by man. The remainder is un- 
consumed, going off in the form of minute parti- 
cles, or is lost in other ways. Man does better than 
this ; but we all consume more food than we should 
require if the digestive organs were capable of ex- 
tracting all its nutritive material. 

The following table shows the amount of differ- 
ent foods digested and undigested by man^ as f oxmd

The various degrees of the digestibility of foods 
have been roughly estimated in the following ways : 

1. By experimenting in the laboratory — the ex- 
perimenter submitting different foods to the action 
of digestive juices at a temperature of about 100° F. 
for a specified time. 

2. By experiments on living beings, in cases 
where an opening has been caused by accident or 
otherwise, revealing the processes of digestion to 
the naked eye ; or by following the stages of stom- 
ach digestion and removing its contents at stated 
periods with a stomach pump. 

3. By experiments on living animals, with an ar- 



MOUTH DIGESTION. 65 

tificial opening into the stomach — a cruel process, 
but having some value. 

L By analyses of the food eaten and of the ex- 
crement which passes out of the body. The latter 
method is by far the most satisfactory, for it in- 
volves no unnatural condition. By it the food is 
subjected to all the processes of digestion, while 
in the other cases it is submitted to only a part 
of them. The foregoing table was estimated by 
this method. 

It does not follow, however, that foods which are 
not perfectly digested, or which may be difficult of 
digestion should never be eaten, any more than it 
follows that difficult work for brain or muscles 
should never be a^ttempted. The organism acquires 
strength, under certain conditions, by doing labor 
which taxes it somewhat severely. 

From the table quoted it will be seen that sugar 
is the most perfectly digested of any of the articles 
mentioned ; and yet sugar alone would not consti- 
tute a safe diet. Peas and beans, on the other hand, 
are rarely perfectly digested, and yet they consti- 
tute important foods. 

The food in its passage along the digestive track 
is brought under the action of several digestive 
juices, the product of the epithelial cells which con- 
stitute the mucous membrane, and of the glands 
which belong to it. 

MOUTH DIGESTION. 

The first of these juices is the saliva secreted by 
the various glands connected with the mouth ; then 
comes the gastric juice of the stomach, the bile of 
the liver, the pancreatic juice of the pancreas, and 



56 DIGESTION. 

other unimportant juices of the digestive track. 
These juices are poured upon the food, mingled 
with it, and produce such changes in its character 
that from being insoluble it becomes soluble, and 
so modified that if the digestion be perfect the 
soluble portion of what is eaten is passed into, and 
becomes a part of, the blood. 

Digestion begins in the mouth. During each 
twenty-four hours the salivary glands pour into 
this cavity, mainly during mastication, about three 
and a half pounds of saliva. It is alkaline in its 
reaction, and contains nearly half an ounce of solid 
matter, and less than a quarter of an ounce of ptya- 
line, which is its active principle. The saliva 
moistens and dilutes the food while the ptyaline 
acts on its starch, converting a portion of it into 
grape sugar. It is calculated that one part of 
ptyaline will convert 8,000 parts of starch into 
sugar. It produces no action on fat or albumen. 
Starch is unaffected by saliva unless the coat of the 
starch-cell is ruptured by boiling or by thorough 
mastication, so as to expose the starch to its influ- 
ence. 

STOMACH DIGESTION. 

The food passes from the mouth into the stomach, 
where it meets another digestive fluid, the gastric 
juice. A healthy stomach secretes from fourteen 
to twenty -five pounds of this juice daily, which con- 
tains less than half a pound of solid matter, and 
two-thirds of an ounce of pepsine, the active agent 
of digestion. 

The gastric juice is acid in its reaction, or exactly 
the opposite of the saliva. It puts an end for the 



CONDITIONS FAVORING DIGESTION. 57 

time being to tlie digestion of starch, which had 
commenced in the mouth. It has no effect upon the 
grape or cane sugar of our food. It is also power- 
less to digest fats, consequently any oily matter 
in the stomach, like starch, remains unchanged. 
Any albuminous envelope surrounding a fat globule 
may be digested away, leaving the fatty portion 
free. Such mineral matter as is soluble in acids 
is, for the most part, dissolved in the gastric juice. 
Its chief characteristic is its power of dissolving 
proteid or albuminous matters, converting them 
into peptones, which can be taken up by the ab- 
sorbents of the digestive organs, and carried into 
the circulation. 

After the stomach has done all it can in the way 
of digesting the albuminous matter in our food, it 
is passed through the pyloric orifice at its end 
into the duodenum, in an acid condition. Here it 
meets, and is mingled with, two alkaline digestive 
juices — first, the bile from the liver, and, second, 
the pancreatic juice from the pancreas. In a short 
time it is changed from an acid to an alkaline state. 
Any albuminous matter which was not completely 
digested in the stomach, and all the starchy mat- 
ters not completely digested in the mouth, have 
their digestion completed here, and the fatty por- 
tion of the food is changed into an emulsion, which 
fits it for being absorbed. Thus we see the main 
office of digestion is to render the solid matter of 
food soluble. 

The conditions of perfect digestion are several, 
and may be mentioned here. The first is perfect 
mastication. If this is not accomplished much of 
the food is not brought under the influence of the. 

3* 



58 DIGESTION. 

digestive juices and is so lost. Count Rumford cal- 
culated that one-fourth less food is required if it 
be perfectly masticated. The object of mastica- 
tion is to break up the particles into a condition 
in which the digestive juices can be brought into 
immediate contact with them. 

It has been stated that Mr. Gladstone is so im- 
pressed with the importance of perfect mastication 
that he makes a practice himself, and has taught 
his family to do the same, of giving each mouthful 
thirty-two bites — one for each tooth in a perfect 
mouth. It is no wonder that he is able to perform 
such an amount of intellectual labor. 

It is not easy to form the habit of chewing the 
food thoroughly after one has practiced eating 
rapidly for a few years, but by determined effort it 
may be done, as I have many times observed in 
persons who have consulted me on the hygienic 
treatment of their diseases. 

Several years ago. Prof. E. T. Bacon and myself, 
and a few other friends eating at the same table, 
formed a little club, under the name of *'The Eat 
Your Food Slow Society." I was the honored 
president so long as the society existed, which was 
long enough for our individual purposes. We had 
a great deal of merriment on the subject of masti 
eating food, and each member was fined every time 
h^ was caught eating rapidly. I think such socie- 
ties are much needed, and that they might be 
formed at every table. They would serve to call 
attention to the subject, and, finally, to aid in 
forming correct habits of eating. 

During digestion the contents of the stomach are 
kept in a constant state of gentle agitation by the

rythmic, circular, to-and-fro movement of this or- 
gan. This is, no doubt, facilitated by gymnastic 
exercises or deep breathing. 

Those who engage in out-of-door labor do not 
need to make special effort for keeping up the in- 
testinal movement; but sedentary persons, many 
invalids, and women who dress tightly about the 
waist often suffer much in health because the mus- 
cular movements of the digestive canal are feeble 
and inefficient. 

Digestion is favored by the proper selection of 
food, and by the right proportion of fats, carbo- 
hydrates, proteids and mineral matter. An excess 
or deficiency of either is injurious. 

By the best treatment of food as regards cooking, 
flavoring and serving. 

By proper variety of food, with occasional changes 
of diet. 

By moderate exercise, warmth and a genial state 
of mind. 

By good sleep. Persons who suffer from sleep- 
lessness lose their appetites, and their digestion be- 
comes impaired. Sleep, on the other hand, is pro- 
moted by good and suitable food. 

By pleasant social surroundings at the table, and 
by regularity in eating, with proper intervals be- 
tween meals. 

I am a great believer in light conversation at the 
table. A person who sits alone and eats in silence 
cannot enjoy his food, nor digest it so thoroughly 
as one who eats with agreeable people, and enters 
into the talk which ought to prevail ; but it should 
be light agreeable talk. Politics and theology, 
business and the trials and troubles of life should 



^ DIGESTION. 

never be mentioned. Every meal should be a festi- 
val of cheerfulness and love. We say grace at the 
table, and this is right; but we should be filled 
with grace and beauty, then would the words we 
utter be something more than empty sounds. 



CHAPTER Y. 
THE SOURCES OF OUR FOODS. 

Man derives his nourishment mainly from organ- 
ized matter ; plants theirs from unorganized. It is 
true that the former may, to a slight extent, be 
nourished from inorganic material; and it is also 
true that some vegetables, mainly the carnivorous 
plants, feed upon organic matter; but these excep- 
tions do not disprove the general rule. There are 
two sources of organized matter on which man 
feeds : one the animal kingdom, and one the vege* 
table kingdom. From the animal kingdom we ob- 
tain the proteids and the fats — the proteids in the 
form of lean meat and other tissues, and the fats 
in the form of fat meat. We also obtain mineral 
matter from animal food. The animal kingdom 
furnishes no carbohydrates. From the vegetable 
kingdom we obtain the proteids, the fats, the car- 
bohydrates and mineral food. 

There are also some intermediate products, name- 
ly, milk and eggs, which may be called animal 
products, though they are hardly animal foods, 
which serve as nourishment for man. 

The extent to which each of these sources of food 
are used varies greatly with race, climate and habit. 

(61) 



62 THE SOURCES OF OUR FOODS. 

In polar regions the main supply of food is animal 
from necessity, though vegetables are used so far 
as they can be obtained ; but so scarce are they 
that they may be considered more as luxuries, con- 
diments and medicines than foods. In temperate 
latitudes the vegetable world is the most important 
source of food, though animal food is also exten- 
sively consumed. In warm climates animal food 
is used still less, and by far the greatest majority 
of the inhabitants never use any of it. Animal 
products are, however, used here to some extent, 
especially milk. Eggs are less used. I have only 
just received a letter from a Hindoo who states he 
does '^ not remember to have ever eaten an egg." 

In our own climate a majority of scientists and 
physiologists argue that a mixed diet is preferable, 
and that man is by nature and structure adapted to 
it. Why this is so it would be difficult to say. We 
know perfectly well that the vegetable kingdom 
supplies in rich abundance every element of our 
food. The fats of the vegetable world are quite as 
abundant as in the animal kingdom. The carbo- 
hydrates are not to be found in the animal king- 
dom at all; and even the proteids of the vegetable 
kingdom exist in as great abundance as in animal 
food. Why, then, eat flesh ? There can be but one 
excuse for it, and that is the force of habit for ages. 

In early times, when agriculture had not been 
developed, animal food was, no doubt, in temperate 
regions a necessity, as it is in cold regions now ; 
but this is not the case to-day. Every product of 
the vegetable kingdom, from almost all climes, can 
be had everywhere. There is no longer any excuse 
for the slaughter-house and the annual murdering 



PROFESSOR VOIT'S OPINION. ^ 63 

of millions of animals for sustenance. Many of 
these animals have been bred and perfected with 
the greatest care. They have received so much of 
our thought and labor that they have often become 
almost human, and are in some respects superior to 
many of the human race, so full of selfishness and 
cruelty, even at its best. It may be in making the 
changes there would be some sufferings and some 
mistakes, but science must come to our aid, and so 
must common sense. It has always seemed to me 
that the help of the chemist and physiologist should 
be sought in this matter. 

Prof. Voit, one of the most eminent German phy- 
siologists, and who has made many important ex- 
periments on man and his food, recently declared : 
*' I see no reason why man, with well-chosen veg- 
etable food, needs to go to the animal kingdom for 
albuminous matter." Most certainly if he does not 
need to go to the animal kingdom for albuminous 
matter ; he does not for fats ; and he would go in 
vain for carbohydrates. 

In order to get at something practical, I brought 
this subject to the attention of an able chemist, Mr. 
M. B. Manwaring, who has made the subject of 
food a special study, and asked him to take for 
his data the known requirements of the body as 
already given in a previous chapter, and make a 
table showing what vegetables would furnish the 
requisite material. His valuable contribution will 
appear at the close of this chapter. 

I am well aware that no sudden change in man's 
dietetic habits will be made, but it could be brought 
about gradually. Flesh once a day might be taken, 
or three or four times a week, as in the majority of 



64 THE SOURCES OF OUR FOODS. 

well-to-do families in Germany. Fish, eggs, oysters 
and milk might be retained, perhaps indefinitely. 
There is practically little or no cruelty in securing 
any of these; not that they are absolutely neces- 
sary, but people think they are, and so long as they 
think so their thoughts must find expression in 
acts ; besides, this amount of animal food would 
suit the requirements of those who can not or will 
not under any circumstances altogether dispense 
with it. 

It is true that there are some difficulties in adopt- 
ing a fleshless diet. One is that the habits and cus- 
toms of society are not built upon a plan for it, and 
these are not easily changed. A whole family 
cooking their own food would find little difficulty, 
providing they all agree ; but a single member of 
it might have so much trouble as to discourage him 
unless he should be very persistent. And then the 
style of cooking and the choice of foods would have 
to be changed. Our present dietetic habits are 
formed on the rude experience of generations, and 
they pretty nearly, on our best arranged tables, 
provide the requisite quantity of fats, carbohy- 
drates, proteids and salts ; but the moment flesh is 
omitted there would be a great deficiency of pro- 
teids, unless it were arranged for in other articles 
of diet. It would be necessary to use, for instance, 
more oatmeal and bread made from whole-meal 
flour, also beans and peas — all very rich in pro- 
teids. This might interfere with the likes of many 
people whose nerves may have been trained after 
the customs of ancestors not far removed from 
savages. 

Then, again, the danger of enthusiasm without 



ENTHUSIASM WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE. 65 

knowledge has to be counteracted. Men and wo- 
men often take hold of an idea and ''run it into 
the ground." Some dietetic reformers have done 
this and paid the penalty ; others have found it un- 
satisfactory and gone to the other extreme. I be- 
lieve heartily in enthusiasm; it moves the world 
when nothing else will, and it especially moves it 
quickly without our waiting for the slow process 
of growth and the regular unfolding of the facul- 
ties. But enthusiasm needs to be well balanced 
and kept on the right track by science, knowledge 
and common sense, which is, after all, practical, 
every-day science, worked out by hard experience. 

Still, notwithstanding all these difficulties, we 
might make more rapid progress by giving careful 
thought to this subject, as we do to other matters 
not nearly so important. 

The advantages of man's return to nature cannot 
be estimated. That he would become a better man 
there can be no doubt. The fear that his force of 
character and energy might be abated is hardly 
worth considering. In our climate, if well fed on 
the best vegetable foods, he would have energy 
enough, but there would be, I am sure, far less of 
that restlessness and cruelty so often mistaken 
for energy. 

That this reform in our dietetic habits, of which 
I have briefly spoken, is destined to grow, and sure 
to become a part of the struggle in our efforts for 
human progress, as much as temperance or social 
economy, I have not the slightest doubt. 

I now have the pleasure of introducing Mr. M. B. 
Manwaring, previously mentioned, who, at my so- 
licitation, contributes an interesting chapter. 



66 THE SOURCES OF OUR FOODS. 

A PRACTICAL CHAPTER FROM A CHEMICAL' 

STANDPOINT. 

The investigations of scientists enable us to name 
with scientific certainty the classes of nutrients re- 
quired hj all mankind under any and all conditions. 
The more recent determinations of physiological 
chemists also supply us with the necessary data by 
which to approximate relative proportions and quan- 
tities for a typical dietary, the degree of accuracy 
in any given case depending upon certain condi- 
tions approaching or departing from that state of 
things conveniently termed *^ average" — that ac- 
commodating adjustment of differences which in- 
cludes all, and yet paradoxically excludes the in- 
dividual. 

Because the individual is but one of a number 
constituting the average, there must needs be a 
greater or less modification of quantities, therefore, 
to a limited extent, each one must be '^a law unto 
himself." 

The popular safeguard against deficiencies lies 
in the use of an indiscriminate ''mixed diet," but 
which carries with it the liability to excess, to say 
nothing about improper articles of food and misera- 
ble modes of cooking. 

Having for awhile practically applied the general 
teachings of science regarding foods, etc., there 
steps in another reliable advisor of a specific and 
more personal nature, viz., a normal appetite. 
That this may be secured, one should conform to 
the conditions of assimilation of nutrients and the 
functional expenditure of their appropriated ener- 
gy, otherwise the waste of food materials will de- 
feat his plans by rendering useless the quantity- 



NUTRIENTS REQUIRED. 67 

estimates of table I. The foods should be properly 
cooked, thoroughly insalivated, and taken at regu- 
lar intervals; with sufficient fresh air, exercise, 
sleep, etc. 

The following tables are intended to furnish a 
ready means of practically adjusting the propor- 
tions and quantities of nutrients needed in individ- 
ual cases, as also the weights of various foods, ex- 
cluding flesh, required to supply the several nutri- 
ents. 

TABLE I. 

If the approximate quantities of nutrients required 
daily by a man of average weight be reduced to the 
needs of a person supposed to weigh 100 pounds, 
we will have the following figures : 



For hard work 
For light work 



Protein. Fats. Carbohydrates. 

OUNCES. OUNCES. OUNCES. 

( 3.5 3.5 9.5 

( or 3.5 1.67 14.7 

S 3.0 3.0 9.5 

\ or 3.0 1.5 14.7

those below the averajfe -| 
In health, age, etc. { or 2.25 to 2.4 1.0 to 1.14 9.43 to 10.0 

As this table is based on the general conditions 
specified, extraordinary exertion would demand 
larger quantities of food materials than the maxi- 
mum figures indicate; and, on the other hand, the 
invalid and those exceptionably below the average 
in any particular require less than the minimum 
quantities named, until better health demands in- 
creased quantities. 

The difficulties of fixing a standard dietary have 
already been referred to — the varying internal and 



68 



THE SOURCES OF OUR FOODS. 



external conditions have each a voice in the mat- 
ter; but we have endeavored to present a sliding 
scale, within limitations, which may serve as a 
general guide to those realizing that a proper diet- 
ary means not only quantity, but quality and rela- 
tive proportions ; who know the importance of a 
proper adjustment of foods, so that the supplies of 
each class will, as nearly as possible, equal the 
systemic wants — the waste and repair balancing 
each other — that disease may be avoided or cured 
by guarding against either extreme of a partially 
starvation diet or that of the gourmand. A person 
may be filled to repletion, and yet suffer from in- 
anition ; or may feel comparatively empty, and still 
be over-fed ; hence the common origin of most dis- 
eases.

IMPORTANT TABLES. 69 

As will be observed in tables III, IV and V, only 
the first column of figures shows the number of 
ounces required, of a given food, to supply one 
ounce of the nutrient named at the head of the 
column ; the remaining columns give the quantities 
of the other two nutrients contained in the number 
of ounces designated in the first column. For ex- 
ample : upon referring to table III, it will be seen 
that to obtain 1 oz. of protein from cheese we must 
use 2.63 oz., which quantity also contains 0.24 oz. 
of carbohydrates and 0.184 oz. of fatty matters. 

In making use. of these tables, consult the first 
column of table III to find the quantities necessary 
to furnish 1 oz. of protein ; the first column of table 
IV for 1 oz. of carbohydrates, and the first column 
of table V for 1 oz. of fatty matters. When the 
second and third columns show appreciable quanti- 
ties they should enter into the calculation.

We have included in our tables the dairy pro- 
ducts, as milk is just over the line that divides vege- 
table and animal foods. Milk contains all the nutri- 
ents, and in such proportions that it is nearer a 
perfect food than any other of animal origin. With 
bread or other starchy material it is an admirable 
food for adults. The whole wheat stands foremost 
as a nearly, if not quite, perfect food. Made into 
bread and eaten with milk or a little butter it is all 
that can be desired. 

Those, however, who prefer a strictly vegetarian 
dietary, can substitute olive or cottonseed oil and 
nuts (especially during cold weather) for butter and 
fat of meats — the latter is also represented by the 
starches, sugars and cellulose of vegetable products. 
Flesh has its counterpart in casein of pease, beans 
and lentils, gluten of wheat and fibrin of oatmeal. 

The cereals generally, or foods rich in protein, 
abound in all necessary mineral matter, largely in 
the form of phosphates — gluten of wheat, whole 
wheat flour, oatmeal and barley head the list. 



WEIGHING OUR FOOD. 73 

Preference should be given to cereals that have 
been deprived of their outer shell, while retaining 
the bran coats. 

Gluten of wheat is one of the best articles of diet 
to aid in reducing excessive fatness. 

We fully expect to arouse the usual amount of 
prejudice against the unusual feature of letting the 
scales determine the amount of food to be taken. 
All we have to say in extenuation is that we sug- 
gest this mode as the scientific and only reliable 
method. 

To the one in a thousand who is as particular 
about correctness in the weight of food swallowed, 
as in weight purchased, we would advise, — until 
the eye and normal appetite are able to portion off 
quantities with tolerable accuracy, — that he makes 
a practical use of these tables, which require : 

1. Weighing articles of food before and after 
cooking, until relative weights are ascertained. 

2. Measuring the height of the person to find from 
table II what the weight ought to be. 

3. Ascertaining from table I the quantity of each 
of the nutrients needed per day or meal, figured 
for what the weight of the person should be. 

4. Adjusting from tables III, IV and V the re- 
quired quantities of an agreeable variety of foods, 
for every day of the week, sufficient to supply the 
needed nutrients. 

For bulk, or quantity without much nutriment, 
fruits are most useful. There can also be added 
such watery vegetables as salads, carrots, turnips, 
tomatoes, cauliflowers, potatoes, spinach, cabbages, 
beets, onions, parsnips, squash, pumpkins, etc. 
The importance of fruits as an adjunct to the foods

rich in nutrients can hardly be overestimated. 
Among other advantages, the writer has found by 
actual trial that the vegetable acids are powerful 
solvents of legumin or vegetable casein. 

The foregoing tables include only good foods; 
and the character and proportions of their consti- 
tuents show how abundantly the vegetable king- 
dom furnishes all the nutrients, notwithstanding 
the popular notion that strength is dependent on a 
flesh diet. 

A word about beans. These are usually difficult 
to digest, but are so important a food that they can 
hardly be dispensed with. The outer coat or skin 
of the bean is the mischief maker, and should be 
removed for the same reason we peel a potato. To 
do this, previous to baking, after soaking the beans 
as usual over night or longer, rub them between 
the hands. A less troublesome plan is to boil the 
beans instead of baking them, and then rub them 
through a colander. Beans should be cooked at 
least eight hours, and preferably longer.

CHAPTER YI. 
THE ECO]J^OMY OF FOODS. 

There is a true and a false economy in selecting 
our food. A true economy selects that which is 
most nourishing, most vrholesome and best adapted 
to the bodily requirements. The question of ex- 
pense is a secondary matter. I have never taken 
much interest in any plan calculated to reduce the 
cost of our daily food to a minimum unless, at the 
same time, the idea of maintaining the health and 
strength were considered as paramount. If a man 
can be fed on a penny a day, and nourished so as 
to be capable of doing only 300 foot-tons of work, 
or two-thirds as much as a well-fed man, and if it 
costs a dollar to feed him so that he can accom- 
plish a full day's work of not less than 400 tons, 
then the latter food is most economical. It is, 
however, very fortunate that the most wholesome, 
nourishing and suitable foods are cheapest, so that 
a man must be very poor indeed to starve if he 
knows how to adapt means to ends in the daily 
rounds of his life. Most of us pay for flavors, 
delicacies or dainties more than we need to for 
abundant nourishment. If an article of diet does 
not suit our taste, no matter how wholesome and 
nourishing it is, v/e discard it for something less 
nutritious but more expensive. 

(75) 



76 THE ECONOMY OF FOODS. 

The most economical food is that derived from 
the vegetable kingdom. The Greek peasant, a 
most frugal, hardy and industrious person, often 
capable of bearing great burdens, lives principally 
on bread, olive oil and fruit, the entire cost of 
which is rarely over four cents a day. The same is 
true of the Russian, Italian and Spanish peasants. 

Charles Darwin says in a letter on this subject : 
''1 have always been astonished at the fact that 
the most extraordinary workers I ever saw, viz., 
the laborers in the mines of Chili, live exclusively 
on vegetable food, including many seeds of legu- 
minous plants," the whole expense of which could 
hardly have been over a few cents. 

It is very true that hard-working men, living 
much in the open air, can extract more nourish- 
ment from plain, coarse food than sedentary per- 
sons, whose powers of digestion have been weak- 
ened by debilitating habits ; but this does not alter 
the general fact that vegetable foods are cheaper 
than animal. I have asked Mr. M. B. Man waring, 
author of one of the preceding chapters, to calcu- 
late for me some tables showing the cost of protein, 
carbohydrates and fats in a few of our principle 
articles of diet, in order that this subject may 
have a practical illustration. Tables VI, YII and 
VIII are the result of his studies. I preface them 
with his letter of explanation. 

Bayonne, N. J"., Feb. 14, 1888. 

Dr. Holbrook: 

My Dear Sir: The following tables comple- 
ment the preceding by showing what the consumer 
actually pays for sufficient of each food to furnish 



EXPLANATORY LETTER. 77 

a pound of each of the several nutrients, at aver- 
age retail prices in New York. The basis of the 
calculations is the relation to each other of 14, 7 
and 12 for protein, carbohydrates and fats respect- 
ively. Should this relation be considered some- 
what arbitrary, results at least show compar^ative 
costs, which, after all, is the real value of such 
tables. 

In figuring the cost of a pound of a given 
nutrient, allowance has been made for the cost of 
the other nutrients contained in the food ; in other 
words, when calculating the cost of a sufficient 
quantity of a food to supply a pound of protein, the 
relative costs of carbohydrates and fats also in the 
food have been deducted. 

In each table the articles of food are arranged in 
the order of the comparative cost of a pound of the 
nutrient named, that standing first which is cheap- 
est, and the most expensive last. This order of 
arrangement of course has no regard to the order 
of costs or quantities of commercial foods, for the 
quantities required of the latter vary greatly, as 
shown by the preceding tables, and a food appar- 
ently more expensive than another may actually be 
cheaper. 

The figures are carried out to four places when 
the amounts are less than even cents, as rounding 
off would give too high results when multiplied. 
To express these decimals of a cent in fractions 
would make the figures less easy to handle. 

The cost of apples given is the only case wherein 
I am not thoroughly satisfied. No satisfactory in- 
formation could be obtained from wholesalers — dif- 
erent apples weighed differently per bbl. Eighteen 



78 THE ECONOMY OF FOOD. 

or twenty different retail grocers were called on, 
but there was no agreement whatever as to the 
weight of a bbl. or a measure of apples. Further- 
more, different grocers made a different number 
of pecks to the bbl., varying from nine to thirteen, 
etc., etc. As regards some other articles I made 
my own corrections, for example,* potatoes, onions, 
sweet potatoes, etc. While the legal weights are 
one thing, the actual weights are quite another. 
You will notice several curious results — for in- 
stance. Table YII, corn, costs .0286 cents per lb., 
and the carbohydrates in it cost the same. Again, 
butter at 30c. per lb. costs less than the fat in milk. 
Here we have labor added and a cheaper product; 
hut the price of milk is regulated by the cost of 
cartage and the loss in transit, which appear to 
overbalance the labor of butter making. 

The number of eggs required to make a pound, 
was determined by boiling about a dozen or more 
eggs, removing the shells, and weighing. A curi- 
ous fact was thereby discovered, viz., that eggs 
lose water by boiling them in water, the same 
as if heated in the open air. An egg weighing 55 
grm. before boiling weighed 51.2 grm. after boiling 
thirteen minutes. 

While the figuring of these tables was quite com- 
plicated, the results will enable any one to estimate 
the costs of a pound of nutrients at any other mar- 
ket price, by simple proportion. An example 
of this is given in the case of beef, moderately fat, 
in Table YI. In one case beef at 12 cents costs for 
a pound of protein .4647 cents, or about 462- cents; 
the other at 24 cents costs for a pound of protein 
93 cents — double the cost of beef obviously doubles 



EXPLANATORY LETTER. 79 

the cost of all its nutrients, hence doubles the cost 
of the pound of protein. I certainly would make a 
point of this so that readers can estimate the cost of 
nutrients for any fluctuations in market prices, or 
any variations in different parts of the country. 
The great use of these tables is the double one 
of showing people how to live cheaper, and that 
vegetable foods not alone supply all the nutrients, 
but for much less money, aside from other advan- 
tages. 

One thing is certain, any reader who does not 
even take the trouble to look at the figures, will see 
that any article of food that precedes another in 
the tables is cheaper than the succeeding article 
for the nutrient named ; and while but few would 
or could retain in the memory the actual costs of 
the nutrients, the order of arrangement would soon 
fix itself in the memory ; especially the cheapness 
of the vegetables and the expensiveness of flesh — 
that corn is cheapest and oysters and lager beer 
the dearest, etc. 

The calculations have been carefully checked, so 
that they can be relied upon. However, analyses 
vary considerably, and where I could I have aver- 
aged them. 

Troublesome as it would be, it would be a grand 
THING for some one not only to figure out the costs 
per pound of nutrients for all our foods, as well as 
the quantities of each food required for a pound of 
nutrient, but to make out economical bills of fare 
including a good variety, that would supply all the 
nutrients in sufficient quantities and in the right 
proportions to each other, for a man of a supposed 
weight of 100 lbs. Such a scheme would neces- 



80 THE ECONOMY OF FOOD. 

sitate getting the weights and volumes of foods 
after they are prepared for the table. This worked 
out and put in a practical shape would prove a 
great boon to our working classes, as well as to 
the poor in' health. And such a scheme would be 
an undertaking. 

Yours truly, 

M. B. Manwaring.

I have not deemed it necessary to enlarge these 
tables so as to have them include all articles used 
as food, interesting as it might have been. The 
reader can make similar calculations for himself if 
he wishes. I only desired to show that in practic- 



84 THE ECONOMY OF FOOD. 

ing economy in food the true way is to use the best 
foods from the vegetable kingdom, and lesS meat, 
bearing in mind always that articles which contain 
a large amount of protein are needed to supply the 
deficiency caused by the use of less flesh. It will 
also be noticed that the mineral matter of our food 
has been omitted from the calculation. The omis- 
sion, however, can not have any perceptible effect 
on the expense of food, important as it is as an arti- 
cle of nutriment. 

It should be borne in mind that while the consti- 
tuents of some of the foods are low in price, yet 
the quantity of them in a pound is so small that 
a sufficient amount to meet the requirements of the 
body could not be obtained without consuming more 
than the digestive organs could manage. This is 
seen conspicuously in the case of the potato. It 
would require nearly 23^ pounds of this vegetable to 
furnish 3 ounces of protein — an amount sufficient 
for a person weighing 100 pounds and doing only 
moderate work. This would at the same time fur- 
nish seven or eight times as much carbohydrates as 
are required. Milk is another example. It would 
require about six pounds of milk daily to supply the 
protein for a man doing only moderate work and 
weighing 150 pounds. This would also supply him 
with about two-thirds of the fat required, but not 
nearly enough of the carbohydrates. 

I ought, perhaps, to remark that writers on diet- 
etics tell us that animal food is more easily digested 
than vegetable, and also that more of it is absorbed 
in the digestive processes, and, consequently, there 
is less tax on the organs of digestion, and this should 
be considered in discussing the economy of any 



MEAT eaters' DIGESTION. 85 

food. There may be some truth in this, for those 
who have long habituated their stomachs to flesh, 
and who have debilitated them by sedentary and 
unhygienic habits; but for those, who have lived 
in a more healthful and natural manner, I believe 
this objection has little or no force. The digestive 
organs, like all other organs of the body, are subject 
to the law of habit, and they do that most easily 
which they have been accustomed to do. 

Sir William Thompson says : '* The meat eater's 
digestion is taxed with a far less quantity of solid 
food, but that very concentration in regard to quality 
entails on some stomachs an expenditure of force 
in digestion equal to that required by the vegetable 
eater to assimilate his much larger proportions." 

It must not be forgotten that economy of food is 
promoted by a right relation of the proportions be- 
tween its various constituents. Fats and starches 
cannot serve the purpose of protein. Protein, on 
the other hand, may take the place of the carbo- 
hydrates or fats, but only at a loss of 47 per cent, 
of the total amount transformed and used for pro- 
ducing heat. 

Something might be said of economy in food by 
saving rather than wasting. Very few know how 
much valuable material is thrown away. This is a 
fault of the rich and poor alike. Some years ago I 
asked a wealthy patient if he would have an estimate 
made for me of the number of pounds of flesh used 
by each person in his family, including his servants. 
A few days later he brought me the statement that 
three pounds was about the amount purchased for 
each one; ''but," he added, *'I think two-thirds 
of it is wasted." The poor add to the expense of liv- 



86 THE ECONOMY OF FOOD. 

ing because they purchase such small quantities at a 
time; because often from pride they choose the most 
expensive articles, and because they do not prepare 
it so as to make it all available to the system. 

It is poor economy to buy stale vegetables, even 
at a reduced price. Fresh flour, fresh fruits and 
other articles are both healthier and more nourish- 
ing than if old. Even before decay has actually set 
jn there has been a molecular change in the consti- 
tuents of the food which renders it less nutritious. 

There is also a loss from cooking some things too 
much or too little, and both these evils must be 
avoided. 

I am certain that there is a loss of nutriment in 
cooking most of our fruits. The real value of them 
cannot be determined by chemical analyses. Some of 
their properties are so subtle as to elude our grasp, 
but we feel their effects when we take them into our 
systems in refreshment. They no doubt act largely 
through the nervous system, and may be electrical 
in their nature. Cooking destroys this. I do not 
say that these articles should never be cooked, but 
only that there is loss in cooking them, especially if 
we can eat them perfectly fresh and alive. The life, 
the soul of fruits are lost in cooking. The child 
understands this. With what delight he looks on 
the apple, the pear, the peach, the grape ! How he 
longs to clutch them in his hands and to hurry them 
into his mouth ! If used rightly their value to him 
is inestimable. 

In urging a larger use of vegetable food I do not 
forget that most persons who prepare food hav^ 
given more attention to the preparation of animal 
substances than vegetable, and so as a matter of 



MATERIA ALIMENTARIA. 87 

economy it will pay well to reverse this order and 
give vegetable foods more attention. Dr. B. W. Rich- 
ardson says on this subject: ''Up to the present 
time CO much more skill has been developed in the 
preparation of animal foods for the table than has 
been bestowed on vegetables that in order to give 
the vegetarian system the faintest chance a new 
school of cookery will have to be introduced in 
which there shall be taught not only modes of cook- 
ing, but the actual dietetic value of everything 
cooked and sent to the table." 

Sir James Paget estimates that the time lost in 
England and Wales yearly from sickness amounts 
to 20,000,000 weeks. This includes only losses of 
those between fifteen and sixty-five years of age, and 
does not include the trivial headaches and pains 
which do not keep one from his labor. If to this is 
added the sickness of those under fifteen and over 
sixty-five the loss becomes appalling. It is probably 
more in this country. 

It should not be forgotten that any food which 
promotes health and strength has in it an element 
of economy of the highest. value. There can be no 
doubt but the waste of time and strength, and the 
expense of medical attendance which, in the aggre- 
gate, is an enormous sum every year, would be re- 
duced at least one half by choosing the best foods, 
and preparing them in the best manner. This can 
only be done by studying the subject as a science 
and as an art. Materia Medica is an important study 
in all our medical schools. Materia Alimentaria 
should be a still more important one for every hu- 
man being. Until this is the case economy of food, 
in its highest and best sense, will not be accom- 
plished. 



88 THE ECONOMY OF EOOD. 



A PRACTICAL LESSON. 



As a practical illustration of economy in food, to- 
gether with improved healfch, I give the following 
letter, among many in my possession, not as a 
model for others, for I know well enough that no 
two persons are alike in their needs, but to illustrate 
a principle. The letter is from Mr. A. H. Frank, a 
well-known inventor and manufacturer, whose 
machines have a world-wide use. Mr. Frank's let- 
ter is so full of interest that I shall give it entire 
and in his own words. 

Buffalo, N, Y., March 21, 1888. 
Dr. M. L. Holbrook: 

Dear Sir — I am in receipt of your letter of the 20th 
inst., reminding me of my promise when in New 
York to write you something of my manner of liv- 
ing, its cost, etc. I have experimented considera- 
bly during the past six years. Previous to that 
time I ate a mixed diet, eating more or less flesh 
meats ; I ate very sparingly of pies and cakes. The 
last three or four years of my eating meat my 
stomach was very weak. The last year I could not 
eat a full or average meal. At the age of fifty-eight 
I was what you might call a pretty well used-up 
man. Six years ago last August I discarded all flesh 
meats and animal fats, and have since that time 
greatly improved in health. I have had no further 
trouble with my stomach, unless I am careless and 
eat too much, which is the only thing I have to 
guard against, as I have such a good appetite three 
times a day every day in the year, and my food 
tastes so delicious that, unless I am very careful, I 
eat too much before I am aware of it. Tea and 



MR. Frank's letter. 89 

coffee I place with tobacco and alcoholic drinks, 
and use none of them. I have not drunk a cup of 
tea since I was twelve years old, and never drank 
three cups of coffee in my life ; I am past sixty-four, 
have excellent health, can do fine work, or read 
without spectacles — never use them. I can do more 
work, either mental or physical, than on a mixed 
diet. I discarded butter and milk at the same time 
I did meat ; after about three years I backslid, so 
that I used milk for a while. It seemed to agree 
with me, but all the time I felt that it was degrad- 
ing to employ an old cow to eat for me, and wrong 
to rob the calves of what belonged to them, while 
I had an abundance of better food. I am free now, 
as I am weaned, and shall never eat it again. When 
I once get my foot on a bad habit and make a pledge, 
or say I won't, it is for all time. I made several 
pledges over a half century since which have never 
been broken. I never drink at my meals, and sel- 
dom at any time, as it is often months at a time that 
I do not experience thirst. 

My principal food is fruit and bread with no salt 
with either; there is plenty of pure water in the 
fruit. I occasionally eat vegetables, which I salt 
a little; I can't see that it makes any difference 
whether I eat salt or not. For three years I did not 
eat one ounce of salt. During that time I scarcely 
touched potatoes or other vegetables. I like them ; 
do not think them very bad, and as they are more 
palatable with salt I use it ; yet I think if I were to 
let them entirely alone and eat only the carrots, 
beans, peas and lentils, fruits and nuts, rich in 
vegetable oil, it would be quite as well. 

There is a great saving in living the way I do in

cost of food and the labor required to prepare it. I 
can live on anywhere from two to twelve cents a 
day. I feel just as well and strong when I eat what 
I can buy for two or three cents at retail as when I 
pay ten cents, but it is plainer than I care to live 
I have tried it and did two men's hard work, eat- 
ing nothing but one pound of corn a day. I felt 
just as well and could see no difference in my 
strength than when I ate a greater variety. One 
pound of wheat which costs less than two cents, 
and two pounds of apples, which cost still less (buy- 
ing by the barrel or bushel), are more than a day's 
rations. If I add pears and grapes it doubles or 
trebles the cost. If families would adopt this plain, 
simple mode of living, none need want for food, and 
the pleasure of eating would on the average be in- 
creased four-fold. The housewife would also be re- 
lieved of full four-fifths of her labor in the kitchen, 
and doctors' bills would soon be reduced nineteen- 
twentieths, if not entirely dispensed with, intem- 
perance banished from the land, and the average 
length of life doubled in two generations of time. 
There is not wealth enough in the State to hire me 
to eat and drink as do the average of mankind. 

I will now describe how I make gems . I weigh my 
flour and water, then I know just what I have, and 
there is no guesswork about it. I use one pound of 
the best unbolted wheat flour to one pound water ; I 
use a cast iron gem pan with eleven cups, which 
takes one pound of flour to fill. I heat the pan as 
hot as a quick oven will heat it ; I stir the flour and 
water thoroughly and fill the gem pan as quickly as 
I can and bake as fast as it will bake without burn 
ing. If baked quickly they will be light. I have 



ANOTHER CASE.- 91 

made gems several hundreds of times in succession 
without having one heavy or soggy. If tl: e pan is 
hot when filled and the oven hot, it forms a thin 
crust quickly which holds the air and steam, the 
expansion of which will make the gems light every 
time. In some instances I have had the gems burst 
with so much force as to jump out of the pan. A 
little salt can be used if preferred. 

I liavG stopped at my office long enough after the 
regular working hours to write what I have written. 
My day's work commences usually at 4.30 o'clock, 
A. M., and ends at 5.30, P. M., after which I drive 
two miles and care for my liorse, and often do my 
cooking. I retire at nine o'clock. 

Yours very truly, A. H. Frank. 

I will extend this chapter to give one more case 
related by Meta Wellmer in Almonds and Raisins, 
for 18S8. This writer says: *'Ten years ago, in 
company with two gentlemen and a lady, I under- 
took a pedestrian tour to the banks of the lake of 
Geneva. In T., near Zurich, we visited a teacher, 
Mr. B. Arriving just at noon, when the family were 
about to dine, we were kindly invited to join their 
repast. But having just then sworn loyalty to the 
Pythagorean mode of life, we used only bread and 
fruit; and had already eaten our meal at eleven 
o'clock, under the shade of the green trees, in sight 
of the beautiful lake and the snow-capped heights. 
Round the table sat Mr. B. and his wife and six 
children ; the seventh, nine months old, was creep- 
ing, baby fashion, energetically on the floor. The 
meal consisted of cauliflower, roasted potatoes with 
cucumber salad, bread, fruit and nuts. 



92 THE ECONOMY OF FOOD. 

^^ After the meal was ended, Mr. B. accompanied 
us a short distance on our journey, and told us a 
little of his life's experience. ' I have lived,' he said, 
^without animal food for more than eleven years, 
and in spite of my increasing family, I have saved 
enough money to buy the house in which I live and 
the garden surrounding it. Not one of those among 
my colleagues, who have had no inheritance, and 
have married for pure love, without gaining any 
dowry, possesses a house. My neighbors wonder at 
my success, and say I must have inherited money 
or won it in the lottery ; but the fact is, that my sole 
gain and inheritance consists in my method of liv- 
ing ; whereas, with other people, all inheritance and 
gain is lost by going into their mouths and down 
their throats. Had I adopted this method twenty- 
one years ago, when I entered my profession, I 
might now have owned a villa, like the neighbor- 
ing merchants, and been able to let it to a tenant. 
But my savings increase year by year, and I have 
one advantage over some of my rich merchant 
friends, viz., that of perfect health, which they do 
not enjoy, living, as they do, contrary to the laws 
of nature. For eleven years neither doctor nor 
apothecary has had a penny of mine.'^' 



CHAPTER VII. 
SIMPLICITY IN LIVING. 

Closely allied to economy in living is simplicity. 
In this respect we do not need to go to extremes. 
True simplicity favors health, and in addition to 
it limit expense and saves the time wasted in the 
preparation of numberless complicated dishes. 

For children, simplicity is of the greatest im- 
portance whatever system of dietetics is adopted. 
This has been recognized the world over, even by 
the rich and by the learned. There can be no greater 
error in rearing a child than indulging its appetite 
in every sort of costly and unnatural viand. That 
its food should be nutritious and abundant no one 
denies. That its food should be appetizing and 
pleasing to its palate is self-evident ; but true luxu- 
ry may go hand in hand with simplicity. It is the 
good appetite that makes food taste sweet and give 
enjoyment; without this nothing pleases. The 
same rule of simplicity applies to invalids as well 
as to children. They are often fed exclusively on 
milk, or are advised to eat largely of fruit, or 
brown bread, or baked potatoes and cream, or 
baked apples, or bread, milk and fruit, as the case 
may be. 

(93) 



94 SIMPLICITY IN LIVING. 

But if simplicity is proper for the child and for 
the invalid, why is it not also for the strong ? It is. 
What examples of simplicity were those of Sidney 
Smith, whose society often attracted the wealthy to 
share his single dish ; of Isaac Newton, who lived 
in the plainest way when thinking out his greatest 
works ; of Franklin in his early life ; of William 
Wordsworth; of Socrates, who taught that *'men 
should abstain from meats which might cause a 
man to eat who had no need for food, or to drink 
without thirst." His wife, like many before and 
since, expecting guests, had made, she feared, 
inadequate provision for them. He replied: '"If 
they be honest men it will be enough ; if not, what 
need we care for them ?" These are cases of simple 
living but high thinking. **Read the lives of our 
great men," says Prof. J. B. Mayor, *' read the story 
of their greatness ; read of Hannibal and St. Paul, 
of Luther and Newton, of Wesley and John How- 
ard, and you will find temperance (simplicity) at 
the root of all their virtues." The same author, 
whose own life is one of most beautiful simplicity, 
continues : 

*'This, then, is my first argument for plain liv- 
ing : it is a mighty bond between class and class. 
It breaks down a wall of partition between us and. 
saints of old ; it is the casting off a weight that we 
may start fair for the race set before us. In two 
ways we can make people better off : by adding to 
their means or taking from their wants. The poor 
cannot ape the diet of the rich without ruin; the 
rich may take to the diet of the poor with infinite 
gain to mind, body and estate. Whence come dis- 
eases ? ' From the kitchen,' say Plato and Senaca 



WHENCE COME DISEASES? 95 

and Milton. Multos morhos muUa fercula fecerunf, 
* So many dishes, so many diseases.' * Do you wish 
for health/ asked Abernethy. * Live on sixpence a 
day and earn it.' Many say to me, 'You must be 
strong to bear what you do ; living on 2d. a day, 
indeed ; for shame ! ' I tell them : ' Your feasts, 
where there are twenty or thirty dishes, with a 
chaos of some hundred ingredients, hot and cold, 
sweet and sour, and several sorts of wine — this has 
been my cross. To try experiments in simplicity 
and cheap living is a source of great amusement to 
me.' Senaca puts it neatly : * It isn't the living on 
bread and water that is the happiness ; but the be- 
ing able to be happy even on bread and water.' 

** Supposing nothing was spent in London this 
next month on fleshmeat, tobacco, opium, strong 
drink, tea, coffee, drugs, spices or other poisons, 
what a surplus you would have ! You could have 
fruit with every meal, and set farmers to work 
planting orchards ; you could have fresh vegetables 
and treble the number of gardeners ; money to buy 
books and time and brains clear for reading them ; 
bakers might learn to provide genuine wholemeal 
bread, and every one might have bread to spare ; 
every child, and for that matter every man and 
woman too, could have a cup of milk with every 
meal. Then the whole army of adulterators who 
make things for sale and not for use, the gentry 
\Yho deal in oleomargerine and butterine and all 
else that ends in ine, would fall on their knees, 
crying, ^ Peccavimus, do teach us some honest trade; 
puffing and lies have lost the ear o' th' world.' Be- 
ing no longer enemies of the cross of Christ, whose 
end is perdition, whose god is their belly, who mind 



96 SIMPLICITY IN LIVING. 

earthly things, we should know that our citizenship 
is in heaven. Yerily old Hesiod is right : * The half 
is more than the whole,' And remember another 
of his sayings: ^Well begun is half done.' Begin 
to-morrow morning, begin wisely, and you will 
never repent. Or if you must go once more to the 
school of experience, that mistress of fools, make 
an honest experiment. Next time you are asked to 
a great dinner, say : ^ My host is my friend ; he 
wishes me well ; he wouldn't give me poison if he 
knew it ; I am safe with him.' Eat and drink what- 
ever is offered whenever you have the chance ; and 
send for the doctor that night and next morning 
and the morning after that. Mark your own symp- 
toms and the doctor's report. Do the same another 
time, with one exception : fast the second day. You 
will learn two lessons : (1) Enough is better than 
a feast, for feasting is folly; (2) Fasting is no 
cunning trick of priestcraft, but the most power- 
ful and safest of all medicines. Having learnt 
yourself, begin to teach. When thou art converted, 
strengthen thy brethren. Issue flaming posters 
with a good clap-trap title. Fragments of science 
for the unscientific ! How to be healthy, wealthy 
and wise ! How to sup for a penny and rise next 
morning a wiser and a merrier man ! " 

There are benefits which come from simplicity 
which we can hardly estimate. The first is to 
woman. In most cases, how great are her cares; 
from early dawn to late at night she struggles and 
strives. How much of this struggling is to cook 
intricate dishes for her family and for her friends. 
''They expect," she says, ''something more than 
a simple repast; they expect elaborately prepared 



BENEFITS OF SIMPLICITY IN FOOD. 97 

food to tickle the palate and delight the eye." To 
some extent this is true, but it is not so true as 
many believe. Most persons feel themselves more 
than compensated when they eat vrith their friends 
if the food be simple and good, provided thought is 
stimulated and the spirits are enlivened and re- 
freshed. I have demonstrated this many times by 
giving simple but well-prepared and appetizing 
breakfasts without show or parade, and had my 
guests universally arise from the table with en- 
thusiastic words of praise over the delightful time 
they had had. I have known many others to do 
the same with similar results. On the other hand, 
how often have we all been pained when visiting 
friends, that so much of the time of the head of the 
house was given up to preparing food, which might 
have been dispensed with to the advantage of all. 

The other benefits are the invariably good appe- 
tite which comes from simplicity, the good diges- 
tion which comes from a well-treated stomach, the 
saving of time which can be devoted to higher pur- 
suits, and of money always needed for so many uses. 

Perhaps my readers will say, *^ Those who work 
must eat." To this I heartily agree, and I will 
quote a line from Prof. J. E. B. Mayor, M. A., 
who says:*' I am bound to testify, having known 
Cambridge for thirty-six years, that the ordinary 
life of the men by whom the ivork of the University 
is done is simple in the extreme." So it has always 
been ; so it will always be. The world's workers live 
on wholesome, nourishing, but simple food. Even 
Kaiser William, the German Emperor who died at 
ninety-one, would not eat the rich viands of his 
chief cook, but demanded the plainest fare.

CHAPTER YIII. 

FOOD AND im^EMPERANCE. 

There are a multitude of remedies for intemper- 
ance in drinking, some of which are advocated with 
a zeal which knows no bounds. In my opinion pro- 
gress in this direction must be largely the work of 
education and the diffusion of correct knowledge 
of the true value of life, and perfect control of all 
our faculties. "When human beings have a good 
understanding of the great happiness which may 
come from perfect bodies and splendid health, and 
when they know that these conditions can only be 
secured by obedience to nature's laws of the body, 
then they will prize a knowledge of these laws and 
in some measure, at least, conform their conduct to 
them. 

And, now, what are the causes of intemperance, 
that hideous nightmare that darkens the lives of 
so many of the children of the earth, that blights 
so many homes with a curse more terrible than an 
Egyptian plague. It is not possible here to go into 
this subject in all its fulness ; but a principal cause, 
intimately connected with our daily food, may be 
mentioned briefly. The craving for stimulants^ 
aside from the force of habit, hereditary and ac- 
quired, is, in a majority of cases, evidence of im- 

(98) 



THE CRAVING FOR STIMULANTS. 99 

paired vitality and deficient nerve force, the result 
of defective nutrition, either from insufficient or 
badly prepared food, or from a breaking down of 
the digestive functions by indulgence in excess- 
ive and over-stimulating articles of diet. In either 
case the results are mal-nutrition and deficient 
nervous energy. If I am right in this statement, 
then the greatest foe to intemperance is the sani- 
tarian, and especially the sanitary cook who knows 
how to feed people perfectly, so as to nourish them 
completely. 

When a man is thoroughly well he is always hap- 
py. It matters little whether he be rich or poor, 
learned or unlearned, his spirits overflow, and he 
has buoyancy and joyousness to spare. He has 
such a fulness of life that existence becomes a de- 
light, and he thanks Heaven for it. What does 
such a person want of stimulants ? They actually 
depress him. On the other hand, those deficient of 
vitality, or those whose nervous systems are so 
starved that they do not give out sweet music with 
every breath; those who are poor spirited; those 
whose hands and feet are cold, or who are depressed 
and downcast and feel that they are forsaken ; those 
who have overworked or eaten too much, or gone 
without food and sleep, are the ones who are most 
likely to have cravings for drink. Who has not 
known even temperate people when in this con- 
dition to take a little wine or beer to lift themselves 
up for a moment to the level of the healthy man ? 

Men and women take to stimulants not only to 
overcome exhaustion, but to drive away sorrow and 
care, even to drive away dullness and stupidity; 
but would men and women be dull, exhausted 



100 FOOD AND INTEMPERANCE. 

and stupid if they were full of animal vigor and 
overflowing with strength ? 

So I repeat what I said before : That the greatest 
foe to intemperance is the sanitarian, the health 
reformer, and especially the sanitary cook, who 
lead people into healthful habits of eating and 
drinking, of working and sleeping, of recreation 
and study. 

Every nutritious and healthful meal, neatly 
spread and partaken with thankfulness, is a tem- 
perance lesson. Every well-built house, with conve- 
niences for doing work easily and without waste of 
force, with well-arranged kitchen, bathrooms, sunny 
windows and good ventilation, is a temperance ser- 
mon. Every vegetable garden, rich with nutritious 
food, and every fruit farm abounding in luscious 
apples, grapes, peaches and pears is a foe to intem- 
perance. Every school where there is no over- 
crowding, where the brain is properly taken care 
of, so that it shall not be deranged, promotes tem- 
perance. On the other hand, everything that tends 
to lower human vitality : overwork, over-study, 
too little sleep, too little work, and especially bad 
food — all prolong the time when intemperance will 
produce its evil effects. Every bad cook who pre- 
pares unsavory, indigestible meals creates a demand 
for stimulants. 

Dr. Brunton, in a work of great originality and 
extensive research, on *^The Physiology of Diges- 
tion," says what will be applauded by all : " Good 
cooking is one of the most effective means of stifling 
the craving for drink, which is the root of so much 
evil. Drink craving, in truth, depends as often as 
not on causes of a purely physical nature. Bad 



c 



A STIMULUS TO TEMPERANCE, 101 

cooking is one of the causes of unequal thirst, and 
the * demand' thus created leads very naturally to 
a * supply ' in the shape of alcoholics. The mental 
phase of contentment which supervenes on the 
digestion of food which has been savory and well 
cooked is a powerful stimulus to temperance ; just 
as the opposite condition of badly-cooked meals 
suggests a remedy in the shape of liquor, which is 
often consumed under such circumstances greo/ly 
in excess of any needs the body may, physiologic- 
ally, exhibit for alcohol. This is well seen in Swit- 
zerland, where, when the food is by no means of 
a savory kind, a glass of * schnapps ' is resorted to 
for the purpose of * tempering' the meal, and of ren- 
dering it more appetizing. There is probably a 
mental effect produced by a pleasant, well-cooked 
meal, which affects the brain and nervous system 
in an appreciable manner, but one at the same time 
difficult to explain. Be this as it may, there seems 
no reason to doubt that good cookery and temper- 
ance are sworn allies ; carelessness in preparing 
food, and, it may be added, in feeding at large, 
is the equally stanch ally of intemperance and 
excess." 



CHAPTER IX. 

/itJ^IMENTARY PRODUCTS OF THE VEGETABLE 

KINGDOM. 

I will in this chapter consider some of the im- 
portant alimentary products of the vegetable king- 
dom, 

WHEAT. 

The most extensively used and most important 
is wheat. There are many varieties, differing 
somewhat in chemical composition, their general 
characteristics being the same. The outer portion 
of the berry is composed of an exceedingly dense, 
hard layer, very coherent, and of a woody nature. 
It protects the valuable nutritious, starchy and 
nitrogenous material within. It is indigestible. 
Below this is a layer of albuminous or nitrogenous 
material, containing a trace of fat and considerable 
mineral matter. This layer has very high aliment- 
ary value; and by the older processes of milling 
was partly separated with the bran ; by the modern 
and improved method it is mostly saved, A portion 
of the nitrogenous matter of this coat is known as 
cerealine, and has some value as a digestive fer- 

(102) 



COMPOSITION OF WHEAT. 103 

ment, helping to change starch into dextrine. The 
central portion of the berry is composed mainly, 
but not altogether, of starch. 

Wheat is rarely used in its entire state as an arti- 
cle of food. There is, however, a growing tendency 
to the use of whole wheat, or at least to the use of 
all except the thinnest outer cuticle. There is no 
doubt that this would be a great advantage to most 
persons, both from the standpoint of health and 
nutrition. 

The *' whole meaP' from which nothing has been 
separated contains (as given by Blythe) the fol- 
lowing :

gluten, a portion of which cannot serve >• 21.8

Carbohydrates : Fat, 1.2 ; Starch, 59.7 . 60.9

The white flour from, which the bran has been 
separated has, according to this authority, the fol- 
lowing composition :

Nitrogenous substances not albuminous . 3.41

By glancing at the analyses it will be seen that 
wheat has one important defect. It is almost en- 



104 ALIMENTARY PRODUCTS OF VEGETABLES. 

tirely deficient in fat ; but it contains a very large 
amount of carbohydrates and of albuminous matter. 
We add butter to bread to supply this fat. 

A BEAUTIFUL MICROSCOPIC OBJECT. 

A beautiful object for the microscope is a very 
thin section of this grain. Almost any person may 
prepare one by soaking a kernel in warm water 
until it becomes soft, and cutting it with a very 
sharp razor. The cuticle or bran, in two or three 
not very well defined layers, is outermost. Just 
under it is a layer of gluten cells, nearly square. 
The gluten granules are thickly packed within. 
They are darker colored than the starch cells, 
which lie immediately beneath and extend to the 
center. The latter are filled with shining starch 
granules of many sizes. Altogether it makes a 
very beautiful and interesting picture. 

Wheat is prepared in an almost endless variety 
of ways for food ; but in this place I will mention 
only one which is less known than others. In my 
boyhood days I was rather fond of experimenting 
on food products — a trait I have not entirely lost, 
else I never should have prepared this work. I 
said to my good mother, who always indulged me 
in my experiments, *^Why can't wheat be boiled 
like rice and served with sugar and cream ? '' 
She said, ''Try it." So I took some nice white 
wheat, boiled it till thoroughly cooked, and served 
it up with cream and sugar, much to my own de- 
light and that of others. This is a very simple, 
cheap, nutritious and easily digested dish, the only 
danger being in eating it unmasticated. It requires 
for each mouthful the thirty-two Gladstonian bites. 



COMPOSITION OP OATS. 105 

OATS. 

The oat, less used than wheat as a food for man, 
is in some respects its superior, for it contains con- 
siderable oil. Under the microscope its structure 
is seen to be similar. Prof. Blythe says : **The oat 
possesses all the constituents necessary for the 
maintenance of high bodily vigor, and is one of 
those complex foods that, especially with the ad- 
dition of a little fat, is capable of supporting life 
for an indefinite period. In the border forays of 
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the provisions 
carried by the Scotch was simply a bag of oatmeal.'' 

For centuries it has been a prominent article of 
food among the Scotch ; and it is unfortunate that 
as its use is being largely extended in other civil- 
ized countries it is less used there, especially in the 
towns. The reason given for this is the desire of 
the young people to live as other people do, upon 
hot biscuit and fine bread. The injurious effects of 
this change can already be seen. 

The average composition of oats is given in the 
following table :

THE MOST STRENGTHENING FOOD. 

A German author, Dr. Winckler, writes as fol- 
lows concerning oats as a food for man : 

*'0f a very powerful man we often and truly say : 
'He has the strength of a horse/ *He has a 
horse's nature/ or 'He can maintain himself 
against the strength of a horse.' The working 
power of a horse is so considerable that we measure 
the power of machinery by 'horse power.' Watt 
and Boulton measured the power of horses in the 
London breweries and found them capable of per- 
forming 33,000 foot pounds per minute. Whence 
does the horse derive his wonderful strength ? From 
oats. But the oat does not grow for the horse alone. 
Man can employ it for nourishment, and is able to 
prepare from it many delicious foods and drinks 
which render his body large and his strength en- 
during. 

"The old Germans, whose soldier-like forms and 
great bodily strength excited the astonishment of 
the Romans, lived chiefly upon oatmeal porridge, 
according to the positive evidence of Pliny. The 
oat was, therefore, the food of our forefathers, who 
evidently at some time brought it from their Asiatic 
homes. The Romans learned of the oat from the 
Germans and the Celts. The German races long 
maintained this as their original national food. In 
the eighteenth century we still find that the youth 
in many parts of Germany were brought up prin- 
cipally on oatmeal porridge. Now, unfortunately 
the potato is the daily food of the poor people, and 
only in Scotland is oatmeal the national dish. We 
all know that the Scottish Highlanders are the most 



THE 0A7 A FOOD OF THE FIRST RANK. 107 

muscular men in all Europe, and the Scottish regi- 
ments form the flower of the British army. 

''That the oat is a food of the first rank one may 
know from its chemical composition. Its constitu- 
ents are mixed in such proportions as to form an 
almost ideal diet for the human body, as a compari- 
son of them with mother's milk, the original type 
of food, clearly shows. 

''The milk of a healthy woman contains in 1,000 
grains, 110. IG grains of solid constituents, and in 
these 110.16 grains we find 14 grains of nitrogenous 
material, while in 100 grains of oatmeal there are 
14.30 grains of the same. This remarkable agree- 
ment is confirmed by practice, for we can feed a 
suckling child with oatmeal gruel; and the best 
kinds of children's prepared foods made to replace 
the mother's milk consist mainly of oatmeal. 

"The constituents of the oat in starch amounts to 
about 50 per cent. Its fatty matter is very consid- 
erable. Oats and corn surpass all other cereals 
in this respect. Wheat contains only 1.8 per cent. ; 
rye, 2.25 per cent.; barley, 2.7G per cent.; while 
the oat contains 6.4 per cent, of fat. For this rea- 
son the oat is especially useful in cold climates, 
where a greater amount of fatty food is necessary. 
Very important also are the salts of the oat, con- 
sisting as they do of mineral substances, important 
for the blood and required by the tissues. In this 
regard the oat exceeds other grains. 

"In wheat there is from 1.4 to 1.9 per cent, of min- 
eral matter; rye contains 2 per cent.; barley, 3.1, 
and the oat 3.25 per cent. In 100 parts of the ash 
of the oat, according to Bibra, we find 19.24 of pot- 
ash; 2.24 of soda; 3. of lime; 6.03 of magnesia; 



108 ALIMENTARY PEODUCTS OF VEGETABLES. 

25.14 of phosphoric acid; 3.07 of sulphuric acid; .39 
of silica acid; 1.66 of chloride of sodium, and .42 of 
oxide of iron. The oat has also a very fine aroma, 
which stimulates digestion. Owners of horses well 
know how favorably it affects the appetite of those 
animals. Every food possesses an aroma to a cer- 
tain degree ; but that from the oat much surpasses 
the aroma of other grains. 

*^ Foods prepared from the oat prove to be a most 
certain means of strengthening the body when 
all other so-called strengthening foods leave us in 
the lurch. I know of no means of resurrecting a 
broken constitution so good as using oatmeal gruel 
freely ; and I know that weak persons in their ad- 
vance toward health and strength will thank me 
for this advice." 

Lean and debilitated persons can often, and in 
the shortest time, '^feed up." Pale-faced young 
women, and women debilitated from confinement, 
whom we constantly see growing worse under a 
diet of beef steak and beef tea, and wine and iron 
preparations, often become blooming as soon as they 
are properly nourished upon oatmeal broth and oat- 
meal soup, to which should be added an out-door life. 
It is also excellent for badly-developed children, 
more especially during those years devoted to school 
life — a period which makes extraordinary demands 
on the childish organization. In short, the oat, in 
its varied forms, is an invaluable source of strength 
for both the sound and the unsound. It requires 
the same thorough mastication as was mentioned 
for wheat, otherwise it will not be perfectly di- 
gested. Some people think that they cannot eat 



THE COOKING OF OATMEAL. 109 

oatmeal. Let them masticate it thoroughly, and 
they will very rarely find any difficulty from this 
cause. 

THE COOKING OF OATMEAL. 

Scotch or Irish meal is best, because so perfectly 
clean and white ; but these take a longer time to 
cook than the American steam-cooked preparations, 
and are not to be had everywhere. If the former 
are .used, from an hour and a half will be required 
to cook them perfectly, and perfect cooking is of 
the utmost importance. A pot lined with agate or 
granite should be used, of a size large enough to 
allow the meal to swell, which it does consider- 
ably. When the water boils up briskly stir the 
meal in slowly, using a wooden spoon. Do not let 
it boil over, as it is the best and creamiest part that 
foams at the top. About half a pound of meal is 
sufficient for four pints of water. Keep stirring it 
gently until the porridge has become moderately 
thick, when it may be set over a slower fire and 
cooked till it is done, remembering to stir it occa- 
sionally. It is best to leave the spoon in the pot, 
as this helps to prevent burning and spoiling the 
porridge. The degree of thickness will depend on 
circumstances. For hard-working men, and those 
with strong digestions it may be quite thick ; but 
for children and invalids less so. 

If steam-cooked cereals are used, it certainly is a 
great saving of time, though the flavor is not so 
fine nor the strength so great; the process is the 
same, only a little less water is required, and from 
twenty to thirty minutes are sufficient for prepar- 
ing them. When poured from the pot it should

have a creamy appearance. It will thicken a little 
after it is taken out. The amount of salt required 
will depend on the taste. I prefer a small amount ; 
and if not enough is put in more may be added 
afterward. - 

'*A glassful of good new milk," says Carodoc 
Granhim, *^ should accompany porridge; but the 
milk should not be poured on the warm porridge. 
The cold milk soddens the porridge, and the hot por- 
ridge impairs the flavor of the milk by making it 
neither hot nor cold. But a spoonful of hot por- 
ridge, dipped into the fresh cold milk, acquires a 
piquancy which the palate discriminates and rel- 
ishes ; for one can become an epicure in porridge." 

If any be left over it may be re-cooked with 
next morning's portion, breaking it into the hot 
water before stirring in the dry meal. This sec- 
ond cooking rather improves it than otherwise. 
Cold water should never be used for preparing 
oatmeal porridge if it is desired to bring out its 
best qualities. Some add a little brown sugar 
and butter to the oatmeal while cooking; but 
while this may increase its nourishing qualities I 
could never see that it improved the flavor. 

Oatmeal porridge is rather more difficult of diges- 
tion than wheat meal, and this has caused some 
physicians and others to exclaim against it. "Where 
this is the case it is pretty good evidence that the 
digestive organs have lost their full power. The 
true remedy would be to restore their tone, and also 
at the same time to pay the strictest attention to 
mastication, so as to bring a large amount of saliva 
into it to act on its starch. 

Men may do heavy work on this food, and they

may go to their labor immediately after eating 
without injury, which is not the case with many 
foods. This was illustrated in the remarkable feat 
performed by the Great Western Railway Company 
in the summer of 1872. The rails of 500 miles of 
the road were changed from the broad to the nar- 
row gauge in two week's time. They were held 
down by nuts and bolts, and these had to be un- 
screwed and replaced after moving the heavy rails 
two feet. About 3,000 men were employed, and 
they worked from four in the morning till nine at 
night. To generate sufficient force, in addition to 
the bread, cheese, cocoa and bacon a pound and 
a half of oatmeal was served to each man daily. 
It was sprinkled with sugar, well cooked into a 
thin gruel in pots on stones close to their work, and 
taken as food and drink combined whenever they 
were thirsty. The men liked it exceedingly; no 
beer or alcohol was allowed. The work was fin- 
ished within the prescribed time, and not one man 
became sick or drunk. 

OATMEAL GRUEL AND MILK. 

Oatmeal gruel made from fine oat flour is a very 
strengthening food, often tolerated by the weakest 
stomach which will bear nothing else. Oatmeal 
milk is a healthful and nourishing drink made as 
follows : Put into a goblet or bowl a tablespoonf ul 
of oatmeal and a teaspoonful of sugar. Fill the 
bowl with boiling water, and stir it thoroughly till 
all the meal is dissolved that will. Then pour off 
the fluid part and drink hot or cold as is preferred. 
Oatmeal has certain stimulating qualities which are

very remarkable. These are extracted and used as 
medicines by physicians. 

BARLEY. 

Barley is not much used for food, though pearl 
barley forms a constituent of many soups and 
broths, and barley flour makes a very digestible 
gruel for invalids. It is greatly improved in its 
taste for gruel by adding twenty-five per cent, of 
fresh finely-ground oatmeal flour.

RYE. 

Rye forms an important article of food in many 
European countries, and in early times was much 
used in New England, but its place has been largely 
taken by other grains. It is less nutritious and less 
palatable than wheat, has a darker color, and a 
slightly acid taste. On account of its somewhat 
laxative action it has considerable value in counter- 
acting obstinate constipation. The following is the 
best method of preparing it for this purpose : Clean 
your rye in fresh water, dry it, grind it coarsely in 
a coffee mill; wet up into a moderately stiff dough 
and roll out into a thin sheet, cut up into thin 
cakes and bake hard in a hot oven. One or two of 



INDIAN CORN. 113 

these cakes broken into a teacup of boiling water 
and taken before breakfast is an almost infallible 
remedy for constipation. These dry cakes will keep 
a long time in a cool, dry place. 

It is subject to a disease known as '* spurred rye," 
the kernel of which is of a dark brown color, de- 
veloped enormously beyond the husk. This spurred 
rye is a dangerous poison, sometimes causing death. 

Its composition, as given by leading authorities,

iJWiAiT corns'. 

Indian corn is indigenous to America, and con- 
stituted an important article of food for the Indians 
before Columbus found his way here. It is also 
cultivated in Southern Europe and Africa. Like 
wheat it has an external woody layer for protec- 
tion, below which is a layer of gluten cells, and 



114 ALIMENTARY PRODUCTS OF VEGETABLES. 

under these the starch cells, which are of peculiar 
shape, being smaller than the starch cells of wheat 
and many-sided. Corn is quite extensively used 
as food in Mexico, in the Southern United States 
and to a considerable extent in the Northern States. 
It is very largely exported to Europe, and is, for- 
tunately, partially taking the place of the potato 
in Ireland. 

Its greatest use, however, is for feeding cattle 
and horses, and for fattening pigs. Under the most 
favorable conditions it takes three pounds six 
ounces of shelled corn to make a pound of pork. To 
accomplish this the hog must be kept quiet, clean, 
warm and comfortable. Corn fed in the ear makes 
on an average nine pounds of pork to one bushel of 
ears. If the ears are ground, cob and all, and fed 
uncooked, a bushel will make twelve pounds of 
pork. If the corn be ground and cooked, a bushel 
will make fifteen pounds of pork. 

By comparing the chemical constituents of one 
pound of pork with three pounds six ounces of 
shelled corn, it will hardly need the aid of a chem- 
ist to show that corn, as a food for man, besides 
being cheaper, contains much more nourishment 
and consequently there is great waste in feeding 
it to pigs to change it into food. 

Corn is rich in oil and in starch, but less rich 
in nitrogenous matter than wheat or oats. There 
are very many varieties, all differing in chemical 
composition, and especially in the amount of oil, 
which sometimes falls as low as three per cent., 
and sometimes rises as high as nine per cent. The 
oil of corn differs from animal oil in containing 
fatty acids.

RICE. 

Rice forms a chief article of food for about one- 
third of the human race, especially for those living 
in warm climates, for whom it is well adapted. It 
is extensively grown in some of the Southern States, 
and that produced in South Carolina is equal, if not 
superior, to any in the world. Its chief constitu- 
ent is starch ; it contains almost no fat and but a 
comparatively small amount of nitrogenous sub- 
stance. 

The starch of rice is very superior in quality, and 
very easily digested, owing, perhaps, to the fact 
that the amount of woody matter around the cells 
is very small. Its deficiency in nitrogenous matter 
and oil renders it defective as a chief article of diet. 
It is possible that the small stature of many Hin- 
doos, who live largely upon rice, is owing partly to 
its lack in tissue-building material. It is well suited 
to invalids needing hydrocarbons and to the old, 
who require easily-digested foods, also as an adjunct 
to other foods it has value. Its whiteness when 
properly boiled makes it very beautiful.

BEST METHOD OF PREPARING RICE. 

Rice may be prepared in many ways, but I regard 
the following as the best : 

1. — Boil it carefully, so not to break up the ker- 
nels, and eat with cream and sugar or milk, or with 
fruits in their season. In this form it is quickly 
digested. 

2. — The most satisfactory pudding from it is 
made as follows : Take two teacups of rice, five 
quarts of milk and one cup of sugar ; stir them to- 
gether in a pan and bake slowly for two or three 
hours. This will furnish sufficient for dessert for 
twenty persons, and is equally good, if not better, 
when it is cold.

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BEAN. 117 

PEAS, BEANS AND LENTILS. 

The bean is a very important food, and it is des- 
tined to become much more extensively used than 
even now. There are many varieties, as there are 
of wheat and corn, with slight difference in their 
chemical constituents. 

The special characteristic of the bean, as com- 
pared with cereals, is a less amount of starch and 
a larger amount of nitrogenous matter. This ren- 
ders it an excellent substitute for flesh meat. All 
experience goes to show that it is a more satisfying 
vegetable product for hard-working men than al- 
most any other. In Catholic countries, especially 
France, where flesh food is less used, and where 
during Lent and on Fridays it is proscribed, legu- 
minous products are more extensively used than 
elsewhere. They are much used by the vegetarians 
of India and China, and in some of the provinces, 
especially in those parts where the people have the 
strongest and best developed bodies. 

In Japan the bean is made into a curd, a most 
nutritious article of diet, and the nearest approach 
in its chemical constituents to animal food of any 
of the vegetable foods. A very full account of the 
mode of preparing and using it was published by 
the United States Government in the consular re- 
ports for 1886. This curd is used in soup, croquetts 
and a hundred other ways, and is said to be well 
liked. It might to our advantage be introduced 
into our country, and so might the soy bean gen- 
erally used in Japan and China, which is richer in 
fat than our own beans are. Its composition is 
given by Prof. Koch in his paper on ** The Agricul- 
tural Chemistry of Japan," as follows :

Albuminoids ...... 37.75 

Wood Fibre 2.00 

Starch 24.08

The bean is more difficult of digestion than other 
vegetable products, and this is, perhaps, one reason 
why persons with weak powers of digestion are 
unable to use them. If, however, they be prop- 
erly prepared, thoroughly masticated, and instead 
of being eaten in large quantities once or twice a 
week are eaten in small amounts daily we should 
have less complaint of their indigestibility. Beans 
are more digestible when vinegar or some acid is 
added to them. 

Blythe, in his little work, '' Diet in Relation to 
Health and Work," says : *' To utilize the legu- 
minous foods to the best advantage, they require to 

be finely ground into meal and to be thoroughly 
cooked. An experiment by A. Strtimpell bears on 
this. Leguminous meal was made into cakes, with 
suitable mixtures of eggs, butter and milk, and 
eaten, and compared with the result of eating the 
same substance without grinding, but first soaking 
in water and then boiling. In the first case 91.8 
per cent, of the nitrogen was absorbed ; but in the 
second only 59.8, so that nearly one-half of the 
'vegetable meat' was wasted."

THE POTATO. 

The potato was introduced into England from 
America about the year 1585. The three hundredth 
anniversary of its introduction was celebrated in 
England in 1885 by an exhibition, and by many in- 
teresting papers on the history of this vegetable. 
It is somewhat uncertain to whom its introduction 
was due, although Raleigh has received the most 
credit for it. For nearly two hundred years it was 
not much prized, and it is hardly over one hun_ 
dred years since its use became general throughout 
Europe and America. 

The potato is composed, aside from nearly 76 
per cent, of water, mainly of starch ; and, indeed, 
as the source of the carbohydrates it furnishes an 
abundant supply at a very low cost. Its great de- 
ficiency is fat and nitrogenous substances. A por- 
tion of its nitrogen exists in the form of solanine, 
which is very poisonous ; but as this is mainly in 
the pealing, it rarely causes any injury. Solanine 
is quickly destroyed by heat in baking the potato, 
and this is, perhaps, one reason why baked potatoes 
are more wholesome for invalids and those with weak 
powers of digestion. The poison is, no doubt, also ex- 
tracted into the water by the process of boiling. 

Potatoes should be thoroughly masticated in or- 
der to bring them under the influence of the saliva 
for their most perfect digestion, as the gastric juice 
of the stomach would have little or no influence 
upon them. Indeed, if accepted theories of digesting 
be correct, not much of the potato is digested in the 
stomach. "With some fatty and oily food, and brown 
bread and beans, a cheap diet might be prepared, ca- 
pable of supporting life and bodily vigor indefinitely. 



THE SWEET POTATO. 121 

Potatoes require great care in cooking, so they 
will be mealy, and not sodden. In the latter con- 
dition they are neither wholesome nor agreeable. 

The composition of the uncooked potato according 
to the mean of 70 analyses is as follows : 

Water 75.77 

Nutritive nitrogenous substances . . .84 

Non- nutritive " *' . . .95

THB SWEET POTATO. 

Another delicious tuber is the sweet potato. It is 
said to be indigenous in the Malagan Archipalago, 
growing wild in the woods. It requires a warmer 
climate, and a warmer soil, than the common potato, 
and more care in raising. It is cultivated in the 
south of Europe, in India, and in America; but, 
since the introduction of the Irish potato, its use in 
Europe is somewhat less. Its composition differs 
considerably from the common potato, and it is a 
little more expensive article of diet. 

Its composition, according to Payan, is as follows: 

Nitrogenous matter 1.50 

Starch 16.05

THE OmON. 

The onion is used extensively throughout the 
civilized world, and is very nutritious. Those 
grown in northern climates are stronger and less 
delicate than those grown in warm latitudes. 

In Spain and Portugal the raw onion, with bread, 
often forms a dinner for the working man. The 
peculiar taste of the onion is, in a large part, due to 
an acrid, volatile, sulphurous oil, much of which is 
dissipated by boiling. 

Onions sliced into beans, peas or lentils and boiled 
with them improve the flavor of the latter, and 
strange to say, entirely lose their odor and power 
to taint the breath. 

Its average composition is (Blythe) :

OTHER ROOTS, 

The carrot, parsnip, turnip, beet and radish have 
little nutritive value, being mostly water. They 
cannot be said to be important articles of diet, but 
for change and variety they have some value. 
They are also useful in making vegetable soups. 

\the cabbage. 

The cabbage tribe is large, including as it does 
cauliflower, broccoli, Kohl-rabi and some others. 



RHUBARB, CELERY, ETC. 123 

They contain about 90 per cent, of water, and con- 
sequently little nourishment. When fresh, crisp 
and tender they have a delicate, almost delicious 
taste, and for those who live upon highly concen- 
trated food they must be useful, 

SPINACH. 

The leaves of the spinach are tender, especially 
in the spring of the year. They furnish an early 
fresh vegetable, which may be considered very 
wholesome, more particularly for those who suffer 
from constipation. Like cabbage, it contains about 
90 per cent, of water. 

RHUBARB, 

This vegetable is said to be a relative of the buck- 
wheat tribe. It furnishes much acid, similar to 
fruit acids, and is useful as an early vegetable. 

CELERY, 

The use of celery is extending rapidly, and when 
properly grown furnishes a delicious relish and con- 
siderable nutriment. It has some reputation as 
an antidote for rheumatism; but other appetizing 
fruits are, no doubt, equally useful. It has also a 
reputation for promoting sleep. 

ASPARAGUS. 

The young and tender shoots oi the asparagus 
furnish an early and and an appetizing food, with 
only a small amount of nutriment. It is a diuretic, 
and contains over 93 per cent, of water. 



124 ALIMENTARY PRODUCTS OF VEGETABLES. 

LETTUCE. 

Lettuce has been cultivated and eaten from time 
immemorial. The head of the lettuce, when crisp 
and tender, makes a digestible and wholesome salad. 
I once had a patient who seemed to object to every 
form of food I offered. I said, *^Is there anything 
you can eat ?" and the reply was, ''I crave lettuce.' 
I brought a large plate of the tenderest lettuce I 
could find in the market, with proper dressing, and 
told my patient to eat all the appetite called for ; 
she did so with a most excellent result. Good, 
fresh, tender lettuce contains about 95 per cent, of 
water. 

CRES&, 

The young leaves of the garden cress make an 
agreeable and healthful salad, much esteemed. 
Watercress, a creeping plant which grows in slowly- 
running cold spring water, is an appetizing and 
wholesome plant, somewhat pungent to the taste, 
but containing little nutriment. 



CHAPTER X. 
FRUITS. 

Writers on dietetics do not rank fruits as highly 
as they deserve, because they are guided by the 
chemist, who finds much less solid matter in them 
than in the grains. From this standpoint they do 
rank low; but their value is not to be estimated 
in this way. They possess precious qualities and 
virtues not yet known to chemistry. Their juices, 
distilled in Nature's laboratory, need no boiling or 
filtering, and never convey the germs of disease. 
How easily they go through tissues of the body', 
leaving their precious salts of potash, soda, phos. 
phorus, or whatever they may be, taking up the 
broken-down debris of the system and carrying it 
off ! Their acids, how refreshing ; their salts, how 
stimulating ; their delicious flavors, how they play 
on the nervous system ! They clog not, neither do 
they cloy. A physician writes to me on this sub- 
ject, saying : 

*'' There is scarcely a disease to which the human 
family is heir but the sufferings therefrom would 
be greatly relieved or entirely prevented by the use 
of fruits, which are now so generally forbidden. 
Many diseases would be conducted to a safe ter- 
mination by the free use of fruits, because of the 

(125)

acids they contain. When our troops were fighting 
the Seminoles in Florida, many were sick with 
diarrhea and dysentery, and cured these disorders 
by stealing from the hospitals into the fields and 
eating fruits, blackberries especially. I have sent 
several children suffering with cholera infantum 
and with dysentery to the peach orchards of Dela 
ware, with most gratifying results ; and where they 
could not be carried to the orchards to pick and eat 
the fruit tresh from th e trees, I have had the little 
sufferers fed with sound fruit with equally good 
results. 

'* In typhoid fever, in the treatment of which such 
extraordinary care is enjoined as regards diet, fruits 
are not only often highly grateful to the patient, 
but work most favorable results. A physician who 
had been sick some weeks with this disease, says 
his diarrhea was cured by peaches. * I ate the half 
of a large peach,' said he, *and feeling no ill ef- 
fects I ate the other half, then one or two more, and 
the next day as many as I desired. My bowels got 
better at once, and my recovery was rapid.' 

**A typhoid fever patient, who had been about 
three weeks sick, and though imploring, was al- 
lowed no diet but beef tea or milk punch, came 
under my care for a few days. I immediately or- 
dered a free use of peaches and grapes, and the 
diarrhea at once ceased, and at the end of five days? 
when I relinquished the care of her, she was con- 
valescent. My impression is, the disease runs a 
shorter and more favorable course under the free 
use of fruits tlian under the usual method of treat- 
ment, and I think the use of stimulants is rarely 
required when fruits are freely given. 



THE APPLE. 127 

*'In the treatment of scarlet fever and diphtheria 
our summer fruits and many of the vegetables are 
most useful, and to the best may be added some, or, 
in fact, any foreign fruit. There is scarcely a dis- 
ease accompanied with fever but grapes and banan- 
as may be freely given to the patient. In the treat- 
ment of dysentery I would very much prefer ripe, 
sound fruits, peaches especially, to any medicine 
that can be suggested." 

THE APPLE. 

The apple is the prince of fruits, and can in our 
climate be preserved so as to continue during the 
entire year. My friend Joel Benton has permitted 
me to quote from his classic essay on this fruit : 

** As iron is rated among the metals, so the apple 
ranks among fruits. It is not the most luxurious 
or the most luscious for the moment, but it is the 
most durably valuable, the most practical. All 
languages make room for its name, and being al- 
ways planted near the house, it equals the dog in 
its notoriety for human companionship. As the 
word hook is appropriated as the chief book of all, 
so apple sometimes stands for fruit in general. 
Scripture and geology, which .have been supposed 
to differ about some things, agree as to its age, both 
placing its birth just a little before man's, as if it 
were said, * Now the apple is born, it is time for 
man to be, who is destined to eat.' 

*' Curiously enough, the apple has a very perti- 
nent relation to the brain, stimulating its life and its 
activity, which it does by its immense endowment 
of phosphorus, in which element it is said to be 
richer than anythmg else in the vegetable kingdom. 



128 FRUITS. 

But phosphorus is not only brain-supporting ; it is 
light-bringing J and must thus contribute to knowl- 
edge. 

''The apple follows the belt of civilization, the. 
zone of intellect, or else is followed by it. It is, at 
any rate, correlative, and we may well say : 
'Where thou art is clime for me.' 

*' The celebrity of this fruit not only goes through 
the mythologies, but mention is made of it in the 
Old Testament in about ten places. Solomon says 
in his Song, * As the apple tree among the trees of 
the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.' And, 
in another place, 'Stay me with flagons, comfort me 
with apples/ 'A word fitly spoken/ says the pro- 
verb, 'is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.' 
Loki, who was the great thief and mischief maker 
among the iN'orthern divinities, stole Iduna's apples, 
and the Grecian writers report a similar f reebooting 
of Mercury, which gives the schoolboy his eminent 
example. Mr. John Burroughs says, ' The boy is 
indeed the true apple-eater, and is not to be ques- 
tioned how he came by the fruit with which his 
pockets are filled.' He will even eat with relish 
that puckery atrocity, the unripe green apple, the 
windfall of July, the very embodiment of vegetable 
total depravity. 

"We are told that in Arabia the apple 'is be- 
lieved to charm away disease, and produce health 
and prosperity. In some countries the custom re- 
mains of placing a rosy apple in the hand of the 
dead, that they may find it when they enter Para- 
dise.' 

"Mr. Thoreau says that 'apples made a part of 
the food of that unknown primitive people whose 



THE APPLE. 129 

traces have been found at the bottom of the Swiss 
lake, supposed to be older than the foundation of 
Eome ; so old that they had no metallic implements. 
Cowley makes his muse give thanks to him who 
restores or improves the apple : 

*He bids the ill-natured crab produce 
The gentle apple's loving juice, 
The golden fruit that worthy is 
Of Galatea's purple kiss.' 

*' It may be safely said that, except the various 
kinds of grain, there is no product of the earth in 
this country which is so good for food as the apple. 
This noble fruit is no mere palate-pleaser ; it is very 
nutritious. Not only is it more nourishing than the 
potato, but it contains acids mild and gentle, as 
well as pleasing to the taste, which act in a benifi- 
cent manner upon the whole animal economy. An 
apple-eater is very rarely either dyspeptic or bilious." 

*' An English writer says : * It will beggar a doc- 
tor to live where orchards thrive.' Mr. Burroughs 
offers statistics showing that certain operatives in 
Cornwall, England, in a time of scarcity found 
apples in some manner a substitute for meat. They 
could work on baked apples without meat, when a 
potato diet was not sufficient. To its healthfulness 
he bears witness : ' Especially to those whose soil 
of life is inclined to be a little clayey and heavy is 
the apple a winter necessity. It is the natural anti- 
dote to most of the ills the flesh is heir to. Full of 
vegetable acids and aromatic qualities which act as 
refrigerants and antiseptics, what an enemy it is 
to jaundice, indigestion, torpidity of liver, etc. ! It 
is a gentle spur and tonic to the whole biliary 
system.

'^ The individual fruit in his hands he describes 
ecstatically : ' How pleasing to the touch ! I love to 
stroke its polished roundure with my hand, to carry 
it in my pocket in my tramp over the winter hills, 
or through the early spring woods. You are com. 
pany, you red-cheeked spitz, or you salmon-fleshed 
greening ! I toy with you, press your face to mine, 
toss you in the air, roll you on the ground, see you 
shine out where you lie amid the moss, the dry 
leaves and sticks. You are so alive ! You glow like 
a ruddy flower ! You look so animated, I almost 
expect to see you move ! I postpone the eating of 
you, you are so beautiful! How compact! How 
exquisitely tinted ! Stained by the sun, and var- 
nished against the rains ! An independent vege- 
table existence, alive and vascular as my own flesh, 
capable of being wounded, bleeding, wasting away, 
or almost repairing damages !' 

^'Mr. Alcott, whom Carlyle could never pardon 
for his vegetarianism, was an equal eulogist of this 
fruit. He says : ^ Apples are general favorites. 
Every eye covets, every hand reaches to them. It 
is a noble fruit ; the friend of immortality, its vir- 
tues blush to be tasted. Every muse delights in it, 
as its mythology shows, from the gardens of the 
Hesperides to the orchard of Plato. A basket of 
pearmains, golden russets, or any of the choice 
kinds, standing in sight, shall perfume the scholar's 
composition as it refreshes his genius.' 

*^ For a filip to the best social feeling and the wit- 
tiest conversation we wait till the apples appear. 
How well they brighten up the dull winter evening 
when they go round ! Whittier, in speaking of old 
times in the country, says : 



THE APPLE. 131 

'And for the winter fireside meet, 
Between the andiron's straggling feet, 
The mug of cider simmered slow, 
The apples spattered in a row, 
And close at hand the basket stood, 
With nuts from brown October's wood.' 

'^ Strangely stimulating is this fruit ! The activ- 
ity it gives to the blood is fairly contagious. I sus- 
pect a good many of the shrewd sayings of our wise 
forefathers, which survive orally in every neighbor- 
hood, owe their spur and sparkle to the juicy apple. 
I have a young lady friend who always beats at a 
favorite game after the apples appear, though be- 
fore they arrive I am occasionally the victor. 

''Mr. Thoreau is fantastic enough to think that 
the man who deals wuth apples should be of a solid 
and robust quality, for he says, ' When I see a par- 
ticularly mean man carrying them to market, I 
seem to see a contest going on between him and his 
horses on one side, and the apples on the other, 
and, to my mind, the apples always gain it.' 

*' There are some api^le-eaters — men more partic- 
ularly — who can apparently eat just as many apples 
after a meal as if no meal had been served. I recall 
a laboring man, w^ho ate six large ones after a 
hearty dinner, and went his way as if nothing nota- 
ble had happened. This was twenty-five years ago, 
and he still lives, and is destined to live, perhaps, 
as long as will the tree that bore them. They were 
eaten raw, as the epicure of this fruit tells you they 
alwavs should be, and the second orthodox rule is 
to 'dispense with the knife.' Any one, however, 
who is not anxious to have them as good as they 
can be, will do the next best thing in following this 
recipe, which I will venture to vouch for : Buy a 



132 FRUITS. 

small tin apple-corer ; core with it as many apples 
as you want, without peeling them; set them on a 
porcelain dish; place this in a hot oven, having 
first filled up the vacancies left by your surgery 
with the best of sugar. Let them bake till they are 
well done. Take them out, and if you do not know 
what to do next, call in your nearest and best friend 
for further advice." 

It would be useless to try to give chemical analy- 
ses of the average composition of apples, they vary 
so. They contain from 81 to 85 per cent, of water ; 
from 6 to 10 per cent., or more, of sugar; from ^ of 
1 per cent to 1 per cent, of free acid ; from 3 to 8 
per cent, of albuminous substances, and less than 
i of 1 per cent, of salts. 

This noble fruit may be served in a great variety 
of ways, or, best of all, may be eaten raw. For the 
latter way the finest, juiciest, most appetizing ones 
should be chosen — those which have a spicy taste 
and refresh almost from the moment they enter the 
mouth. As a part of the breakfast, delicious apples 
often put one in good humor for the entire day. 
At least for this meal they might, with brown bread 
and perhaps a glass of milk or a cup of chocolate, 
for moderate workers form almost the entire meal. 

In cooking apples, it should be borne in mind that 
heat often brings out of poor fruit fine qualities ; so 
that varieties not suitable for eating uncooked fre- 
quently make the best pies and sauce. 

GRAPES, 

I rank grapes next to apples in value and in 
healthfulness. Originally cultivated between the 
20th and 40th degrees of north latitude, and only 



GRAPES. 133 

then successfully where soil and climate were most 
favorable, they are to-day, through a better agri- 
culture, grown much more extensively and farther 
north and south. As an article of food the grape 
has always been highly prized, and its unferment- 
ed juice makes a nourishing drink. The ancient 
Greeks and Romans boiled the grape juice to one- 
half or one-third its bulk and drank it. In Ger- 
many, Italy and France to-day, during the vintage 
much grape juice is drunk, and in many places the 
juice is boiled to a syrup and used in various food 
preparations. 

The constituents of the grape vary with the vari- 
ety, the soil, the climate and state of the weather. 

1. — An important part of the grape is its sugar, 
which may be as high as 30 per cent, or as low as 
10 per cent. The warmer and drier the weather at 
the time of ripening the more sugar in the grape, 
and the less acid it is found to contain. 

2. — No grape is entirely devoid of the acid called 
vinous acid, similar to the malic acid of the apple. 

3. — There is a small quantity of albuminous mat- 
ter in the grape, similar to the albumen in the 
blood, also some gum and dextrine. 

4. — The mineral constituents are, tartarate of pot- 
ash, soda, phosphoric acid, lime, magnesia and iron, 
with a few other unimportant minerals. 

4. — The coloring matter is slight; but some grapes 
contain considerable tannin and fatty oils. 

6. — From 70 to 80 per cent, of the grape is water. 

THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF THE GRAPE. 

Grapes are nourishing, but their nourishing prop- 
erties are not the same as those of bread and meat, 



134 FRUITS. 

for they contain only a small proportion of the pro- 
tein which is required daily. For instance, it would 
take over one pound of grapes to give as much 
albumen as is found in a single egg. But as protein 
is so abundant in our grains we do not need it in 
our fruits, and this is a wise provision of Nature. 
In non-nitrogenous substances, in acids, in mineral 
matter, in pure water and refreshing qualities con- 
sists the great value of the grape. 

THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS. 

The physiological effects of the grape are signifi- 
cant. Eaten with other suitable food, and es- 
pecially with bread in quantities of from one to two 
pounds daily they increase nutrition, promote secre- 
tion and excretion, improve the action of the liver, 
kidneys and bowels, and add to the health. The 
sugar of the grape requires no digestion, but is 
taken almost at once into the blood, where it ren- 
ders up its force as is required; so, also, of the water. 

The dextrine of the grape promotes the secretion 
of pepsine, and this favors digestion. Sometimes 
when grapes are taken too freely the heart may be 
excited by the potash salts, but this need not occur. 
The phosphoric acid, of which there is considerable, 
acts most favorable on all the bodily functions, and 
especially on the brain. Grapes richest in phos- 
phoric acid are best. Preuss found wine rich in 
phosphoric acid most favorable to the recovery of 
children ill with many diseases, and in order to dis- 
cover if these effects were in any respects due to the 
alcohol, he removed it by evaporation and found 
the results quite as striking. He also showed that 
the tartarate of potash in the wine rendered the 



GRAPES. 135 

blood more alkaline, which he deemed to be a bene- 
fit in some diseases. Grapes have been found ex- 
cellent in cases of diarrhea, a result possibly due to 
the tannin, but it cannot be entirely owing to this 
substance. 

THE GRAPE CURE. 

Grapes, say several authorities, act very much 
like mineral waters on the system ; but they must 
be more beneficial than mineral water because they 
nourish, and their effect on the nervous is greater 
through their more agreeable taste. Eaten moder- 
ately with a suitable diet they will not produce 
cathartic effects, but a more natural action of the 
bowels, so important to health, or if eaten in larger 
quantities, they are gently laxative. As soon as 
this occurs obstructions disappear, and a feeling 
of comfort arises which is very gratifying to the 
sufferer. 

'*At present," says Dr. Knauthe, *'the grape is 
used in diseases of the most varied character, most- 
ly, indeed, upon the ground of present experience, 
as also upon that of its ancient reputation. It is 
chiefly celebrated and effective in the treatment of 
affections of the digestive organs, namely, catarrh 
of the stomach, with or without intestinal catarrh, 
heart affections and dyspepsia, which without pain 
are accompanied by a feeling of pressure and ful- 
ness, and which are followed as a consequence by 
loss of appetite, sluggish movements of the bowels, 
sour eructations and heartburn, in habitual costive- 
ness; also in affections resulting from alcoholism. 
It is successful in all diseases where a cleansing of 
the intestinal canal is requisite, as in hemmor- 



« 



136 FRUITS. 

rhoids or the so-called abdominal plethora, in con- 
gestion of the brain, in the most varied affections 
of the liver which cause an enlargement of this 
organ, in chronic jaundice, in pleuritic exudations, 
suppressed menstruation. And further, the grape 
cure acts favorable in chronic bronchial catarrh, 
scrofula, lung complaints, asthma, enlargement of 
the spleen, intermittent fever, cachexie, chronic 
affections of the urinary system, with their various 
consequences, in chlorosis, (on account of the iron 
of the grape). Curchard and Huber observed im- 
provement in chronic diarrhea. Tscharner regarded 
the grape cure as effectual in diarrhea originating 
from nervous excitement of the intestines, as also 
in nervous coughing. Schirmer observed favorable 
effects in chronic catarrh of the areolar tissue, and 
Schulze and Curchod recommended the grape cure 
in affections of the skin, as freckles and scurvy^ 
while Liebenstein affirms that he has cured the itch 
by its use. It is recommended also in gravel, dia- 
betes and Bright's disease of the kidneys. Its ac- 
• tion is especially favorable for the corpulent, for 
the gluttonous and high livers. 

'*The more or less favorable results in these com- 
plaints are to be attributed to the important fact of 
the cleansing action of the grape, and there can be 
no doubt that this treatment, on account of its easy 
application, is to be preferred to other methods of 
cleansing, especially since it is in the power of the 
physician to give prominence to the nourishing, or 
rather to the not weakening, side of the treatment, 
and thus to adapt it to the constitutional require- 
ments of the patient. 

^' Great virj^ue has been ascribed to the grape cure 



THE GRAPE. 137 

in cases of tuberculosis and consumption of the 
lungs, and the different grape cure physicians have 
each peculiar views concerning it, and make great 
and small distinctions concerning its efficiency in 
different complaints, each according to his own 
experience and according to the standpoint from 
which each regards the question of tuberculosis, 
etc. One will apply the grape cure only in chronic 
pneumonia and phthisis where the intestinal canal 
is healthy; another will find it indicated only in 
certain periods of phthisis ; still others think it in- 
dicated only in phthisical tendencies, but especially 
says "Weber: **The grape cure is most suitable for 
persons who are not reduced in flesh, and who suf- 
fer from no irritating conditions of the vascular 
system. Sweet grapes rarely cause diarrhea. When 
tuberculous persons are very lean, poor in blood 
and feverish, the grape cure is not suitable, though 
they may use grapes as part of their diet. For such 
patients foods rich in albumen are to be preferred. 
The treatment which is understood by the term 
grape cure, that is the eating of five to eight pounds 
of grapes in the course of each day, whereby an 
irritation of the intestinal canal and a softer or 
thinner stool is caused, is in chronic tuberculosis 
and phthisis under all circumstances injurious, as 
is shown by the physiological and anatomical con- 
ditions in tuberculosis and phthisis. The first and 
most important task in this disease consists in the 
avoidance of violent action upon the body and in 
securing to it the necessary fresh air and rest. All 
permanently exciting action upon the intestinal 
eanal, even when it is healthy, is especially ir- 
rational, as is plain when we consider the liability 



138 FKUITS. 

of such patients to follicular inflammation of the 
mucous membrane of the intestines, and that this 
may be induced at any time by very slight causes, 
and when caused that the tendency to accumulate 
caseous products in the system may have the most 
dangerous consequences. A good digestion and a 
sound stomach and intestines are in consumption 
of the lungs the most important factors in securing 
a tolerable existence. 

*^A regular use of from one to two pounds of 
grapes daily, together with a nutritious diet, is very 
beneficial to a healthy stomach and intestines, since 
here the fat-building, nourishing effects of the grape 
are manifest ; but, strange to say, this form of grape 
eating is not reckoned as a grape cure by those who 
insist that there should be some certain number of 
evacuations daily ; and yet there is no doubt that 
this method of grape eating may properly be called 
a grape cure, that is, for example, when during five 
or six weeks there are eaten daily from one to two, 
or even three pounds of grapes. Their favorable 
action is certain if accompanied by regular exercise 
and a suitable diet. 

''Paul Niemeyer ("Atmiatrie p. 174) utters the 
truth when he says, ''Modern society possesses too 
little power of abstraction to pursue a mere course 
of breathing gymnastics with daily renewed zeal. 
Devotion comes first when the effort is a means to 
an end, namely, to the consumption and digestion 
of whey, grapes, vegetable juices, and the like. 

METHODS OF THE GRAPE CURE. 

"By the grape cure is understood the daily, and 
for weeks, continued eating of grapes, with the 



THE GRAPE. 139 

observance, at the same time, of a prescribed diet. 
Some are disposed to regard that only as grape cure 
in which at least three pounds are eaten daily, but 
upon what ground is not plain. The action of the 
grapes upon the system is controlled by the kind of 
diet and by the quantity of grapes eaten as deter- 
mined by the symptoms in each case and by the 
constitution of the patient. In accordance with 
this, the prescribed diet is either liberal or restrict- 
ed. Usually the amount of grapes eaten varies be- 
tween three and eight pounds daily. 

"In eating the grapes, the following conditions 
must be observed : The fruit should be completely 
ripe, and should be washed before being eaten in 
order that impurities and insects may not be taken 
with them. The grapes must be fresh from the 
vine, or, as some prefer, may first lie a few hours 
in order to avoid the injurious effects of their cold- 
ness, which, with sensitive persons, causes a dis- 
agreeable sensation in the mouth and in the teeth, 
and also injures the stomach and intestines, and 
may produce violent diarrhea. Eating fresh from 
the vine in the vineyard itself is, therefore, only 
exceptionally to be permitted during the heat of the 
day. The grapes should not be bitten with the teeth, 
but pressed with the tongue against the roof of the 
mouth, by which the blunting of the teeth is les- 
sened. The skins and seeds should not be swal- 
lowed. The cure is begun by eating a small quantity 
of grapes, usually one to two pounds each day, in- 
creased by half a pound daily until the desired quan- 
tity is reached. The cure should not be suddenly 
interrupted, but the quantity eaten gradually dimin. 
ished daily. To those who have an aversion to 



140 FRUITS. 

grapes on account of the disagreeable feeling which 
they cause in the teeth and in the mucous mem- 
brane of the mouth I would give the freshly-pressed 
juice. There are small presses for this purpose 
which the patient himself may use to express the 
juice for each day's consumption. The objection 
sometimes made to this expressed juice, namely, 
that it may ferment before being drank and thus 
cause much injury is not valid, since the time that 
intervenes between the pressing and drinking is 
not sufficient to admit of any change in the must. 
The fermentation may be wholly prevented for a 
length of time by closing up the juice securely in 
bottles. A hermetical sealing of the bottles can- 
not, however, prevent fermentation, since the cause 
of fermentation, the germs, enter during the 
preparation, and cannot be excluded by the subse- 
quent sealing. The juice enclosed in bottles may 
indeed keep longer than that exposed to the air, but 
certainly not for any great length of time. Accord- 
ing to Neubauer the juice keeps for years good and 
pure when well filtered, put into bottles well closed 
up, and then the germs naade incapable of develop- 
ment by heating the filled bottles one quarter of an 
hour in a kettle of boiling water. He also says 
that he has kept it thus treated in his cellar for a 
length of time, that it may be distinguished in 
appearance and flavor from that which is fresh, 
and that it may be used for the purposes of the 
grape cure at any season of the year. 

** Juice not containing sufficient sugar was pre- 
served by the ancients. It was conducted from the 
press into a cistern and then filled into an amphora 
(a kind of jug holding several gallons), and in these 



GRAPES. 141 

vessels sunk in a pond of water until winter. The 
juice by this time lost all tendency to fermentation, 
so that it remained fresh a whole year or longer. 
This was regarded as intermediate between syrup 
and wine, and by the Greeks was called everlasting 
must. 

'* We return now to the subject of the cure. The 
grapes to be eaten each day are divided into three 
portions. Exercise in the open air is necessary dur- 
ing the act of eating. The first portion is eaten be- 
fore breakfast, fasting, between seven and eight 
o'clock, though patients who cannot bear this may 
first eat their usual breakfast and an hour afterward 
take the first portion of grapes. It may also in some 
cases be necessary to allow no grapes at this time, 
or to allow some bread crust to be eaten with them. 
When the grapes are eaten fasting the breakfast 
may be eaten an hour later, and should, of course, 
be light. It may consist of bread, tea, thin choco- 
late or light soup. The second portion of grapes is 
taken in the forenoon, at least an hour before din- 
ner; the third portion in the afternoon, between 
three and five o'clock, but always from one to two 
hours after dinner. Some physicians allow a fourth 
portion after supper (Schulze)." j 

The season of the cure falls within that of the 
ripening of the grapes, which varies according 
to the location of the grape cure, as southerly or 
northerly, and between the middle of August and 
the middle of October. 

The grape cure should be interrupted during men- 
struation and in cases of hemmorhoidal bleeding, 
and it is also inadmissable during pregnancy and 
nursing. . . 



142 FRUITS. 

With regard to the diet, the following articles are 
prohibited, viz. : all heavy foods, foods cooked in 
fat or butter, all foods causing flatulence, potatoes, 
roots, kohl-rabi, etc. ; heavy black bread, milk, 
beer, fat, heavy fish, pickled flesh, heavy farina- 
ceous foods, hard eggs and cheese. Permitted are 
bread, butter, milk, thin chocolate, and fruits in 
limited quantities. The protection of the teeth re- 
quires their being cleansed daily with some powder 
which will neutralize the acid of the fruit. 

Stomatitis and other unfavorable conditions, as 
vomiting, diarrhea and colic are treated with the 
usual remedies. Costiveness occurring in the be- 
ginning of the cure is relieved by a glass of bitter 
water, or by eating a few figs. 

CHOICE OF GRAPES. 

We have here to do especially with those best for 
eating. Regarding these the following are the chief 
requirements : 1. That the berry should not be too 
small; 2. That the skins should be thin; 3. That 
the seeds should be thin and small; 4. That they 
should possess a sweet and agreeably aromatic 
taste ; 5. That the juice should not be too watery, 
but should have a good body, and the berry should 
be somewhat fleshy ; 6. That they should have a 
certain consistency or hardness. According to the 
number and degree of these qualities table grapes 
are classified as very fine and tolerably good. 

It is in European countries that the grape cure 
has been most thoroughly studied and highly de- 
veloped ; but there is no reason why it should not be 
made popular in our own country. We have a de- 
lightful autumn climate, excellent grapes, though 



PEARS, PEACHES, ETC. 143 

differing from the European ones, and many favor- 
ing conditions. In a small way it has been tried by 
individuals here with gratifying results. 

OTHER FRUITS. 

Having given so much space to apples and grapes 
I must pass over with only a brief mention other 
fruits, of which there are a great variety. The pear 
might be named for its fine qualities and the con- 
siderable amount of iron it contains. The peach 
when at its best, and fresh and alive from the tree 
has no equal for deliciousness, and is always a 
favorite with invalids. A few days spent in the 
peach orchards of Delaware, eating fruit and help- 
ing do some of the light work, have benefited many 
invalids. The cherry, with its fine acids is almost a 
cure for diseases of the bladder and kidneys ; the 
blackberry, which when stewed with sugar fur- 
nishes a drink most valuable in diarrhea ; the straw- 
berry, a great luxury if sweet and fresh, a fruit 
that cured Wilson, the ornithologist, of a chronic 
malarial fever after the doctors had failed ; the 
lemon, so full of citric acid as to form the basis of 
the finest drink in the world ; the orange, a tonic 
and a medicine that rarely disagrees, the juice of 
half a dozen of them before breakfast or at almost 
any time will, by its delightful flavor and useful 
ful salts, often turn a day of gloom with one of joy. 
No wine can at all compare with its stimulating but 
not intoxicating qualities. A friend who owns an 
orange grove tells me he eats of them ad libitum 
during the season, and that they make a new man 
of him. Then there is the banana the bread of the 
natives of many countries, the plum, the fig, the

olive and many others I might mention if I had 
space, but it is unnecessary. 

I had intended to give a chapter on nuts as foods, 
but want of space forbids. They abound in nour- 
ishment, but vary greatly in the amount of differ- 
ent substances. Several are rich in oil, which 
might properly be substituted for other oils. Chil- 
dren usually object to fat meat, but will take nuts 
instead. Some nuts contain considerable nitroge- 
nous matter, as the walnut; others are rich in 
starch, as the chestnut. The table of analysis will 
show the composition of most of them. 

By many, nuts are thought difficult of digestion, 
and this is, no doubt, because they contain so much 
cellulose or woody matter; but if properly masti- 
cated, and the outside skin removed, there need 
be no trouble from this source. Nuts contain little 
water, and hence if eaten in considerable quantities 
their digestion is facilitated by lemonade or some 
acid drink. Those who do not eat much fat meat or 
butter generally manage nuts with little difficulty. 



CHAPTER XL 

FOOD FOR DIFFERENT AGES, CONDITIONS AND 

SEASONS. 

No absolute rule can be laid down as to diet for 
every condition because people differ so much in 
their constitutions and needs ; but some suggestions 
based on general laws will be found useful. 

DIET IN INFANCY. 

It hardly needs to be said that nothing can equal 
the mother's milk for the child for the first six 
months or year of its existence. As it is drawn di- 
rectly from the mother's breast it is alive, and in 
this living condition it must be better adapted to 
nourish the infant than any other food. If the 
mother's health is not good, or if her milk is 
not abundant, both can often be improved and in- 
creased by wise feeding. She should spare no effort to 
this end. She may herself drink as much pure milk 
as she can digest, or, what is quite as good, use 
freely thin gruels made from oatmeal, corn meal, 
barley and other grains, preparing them so as to be 
agreeable to the palate, and changing from one to 
the other so they shall not cloy the appetite. When 
the teeth come, and saliva begins to be secreted, 
then the mother may commence feeding the child 
other things ; but still milk should form the staple 

(145) 



146 FOOD FOR DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. 

article of diet up to the second or third year. In 
another place will be found directions for making 
oatmeal cream for the young child — a preparation 
which may be given to it, when it is three or four 
months old, as a partial substitute for the mother's 
milk if this be not sufficient. This preparation has 
proved exceedingly useful in many cases. A large 
number of substitutes for milk have been invented 
from farinaceous foods, many of them of very high 
excellence, and when necessary they may be used 
if more convenient. If cows' milk be used, that 
from a perfectly healthy cow should be procured. 
Goat's milk would be preferable if it could be had. 
Goats well fed and cared for are generally very 
healthy, and their milk better adapted to the grow- 
ing child than that from the cow. 

DIET IN CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH. 

The diet in childhood and youth should be wise 
and judicious, for this is the period of growth and the 
formation of habits which will continue, perhaps, 
through life. Indigestible foods should be avoided. 
Underfeeding and improper feeding may stunt the 
growth of the body permanently during this age, 
and over-feeding, especially if stimulating foods be 
given, may render its growth excessive but un- 
natural. There should be an abundance of good 
breads of all sorts and rightly made, milk and fruit, 
and such vegetables as are suitable, farinaceous 
articles of every sort, including oatmeal, wheaten 
preparations, rice, sugar in suitable quantities and 
eggs to a moderate extent. The drink should be 
pure water or milk, and if any other drink is added 



DIET FOR THE BRAIN-WORKER. 147 

it should be cocoa instead of tea or coffee. The latter 
have no nourishment, and act too strongly on the 
sensitive nervous system of the child, laying the 
foundation of future nervous disorders. Pies, cakes 
and puddings are all allowable on condition that 
they be plainly made, otherwise not. Many of the 
disorders of youth arise from imperfectly pre- 
pared food. 

DIET FOR WORKING MEN. 

The diet for working men has been so fully dis- 
cussed elsewhere that it is not necessary to enlarge 
or repeat here. 

DIET FOR THE BP.AIN-WORKER. 

This need not differ from that of the well-fed 
working man, except in this, that his powers of di- 
gestion are somewhat less, and, consequently, he 
needs food rather more easy of digestion. If the 
brain-worker, however, would keep up his physical 
powers by taking abundance of exercise and air he 
would not suffer in this respect. For perfect work 
the brain should be well nourished, and each one 
will study the subject from the standpoint of experi- 
ence and knowledge and act accordingly. 

The theory has been advanced that brain-workers 
need more phosphorus than any other class of men, 
but there is no evidence as yet to justify this con- 
clusion. "Without phosphorus no thought," says 
one of our German scientists. He could with equal 
truthfulness have said, without water no thought ; 
without air no thought; without many other things, 
no thought. So far as is known, the lion, the tiger. 



148 FOOD FOE DIFFEEENT CONDITIONS. 

the dog and cat consume and excrete as much phos- 
phorus as man, while the beaver, a most thoughtful 
animal, excretes, so far as has been ascertained, 
none. Man, however, requires phosphorus, and it is 
abundantly supplied in a well-selected diet. 

DIET IN OLD AGE. 

The old and infirm should live more like young 
children than adults. Milk, fruits, and especially 
their juices, and breads constitute the bases of a 
good diet for the aged. They need less than the 
young or those doing heavy work ; they should be- 
ware of indigestible foods or of excess. Even after 
fifty years of age there should, in most cases, be a 
gradual lessening of the amount of food consumed. 
Excessive eating in old age keeps up too great a 
pressure on the enfeebled heart and weakened ves- 
sels and renders them liable to break, causing apo- 
plexy, with its accompanying evils. It has been 
suggested that life may be prolonged many years 
by avoiding foods rich in mineral matter, and by 
the employment of acid drinks, especially lemonade, 
to dissolve and cleanse the blood and tissues of their 
broken-down debris. One old man whom I well 
knew always kept a plate of grapes on his center- 
table, and occasionally ate a few of them as he 
felt thirsty. The juice furnished a pure, slightly 
nourishing fluid, and he thought he was benefited 
thereby. He certainly lived to be nearly one hun- 
dred years old, and enjoyed for one of that age most 
remarkable health. Not every one can have fine 
grapes at all seasons, but all can have some kind of 
fruit-juice drink equally good. 



DIET FOR TRAINING. 149 

The bread of the old should usually be made from 
unbolted flour, and hot bread and biscuits never 
used. This kind of bread keeps the bowels open 
without the use of purgatives, which is very im- 
portant. The frequent use of purgatives is one of 
the habits of our time that cannot be too vigorously 
condemned, especially when better effects can be 
secured by dietetic measures. 

DIET FOR TRAINING. 

Trainers of men for boat racing or other athletic 
sports give more thought to the diet of men under 
their care than those at the head of our institutions 
of learning do to pupils seeking an education. Why 
is this ? It is because they wish to get the most 
that is possible out of their bodies, to render them 
capable of working for all they are worth. If to 
compete in mere physical sports and contests it is 
worth while to take such care to preserve the 
health and choose the diet of able-bodied young 
men, how much more ought all to do it in order to 
fit themselves for the labor and struggle of daily 
life ; how many thousands upon thousands fail and 
drop out of the race because they do not do this. 

Some years ago I investigated the question of the 
diet of the students of Yale College, and found in a 
majority of cases it was exceedingly imperfect. No 
attention was given to the matter by a majority of 
them. They lived in boarding-houses and in other 
ways, and took what they could get. While they 
did not starve, yet compared with a young man 
training for a boat race their bill of fare was quite 
defective. Suppose at all college and university 



150 FOOD FOR DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. 

towns the president and professors, or some one 
quite competent, were to arrange a practical, scien- 
tific diet and educate the caterers up to feeding the 
pupils as perfectly as present knowledge on this 
subject will permit, would not our progress be more 
rapid ? I am sure the expense would be no greater. 

A great change has taken place in the rules of diet 
for men undergoing training within late years. Com- 
paring what we now have with what was once 
thought essential, and, indeed, indispensable, we see 
that the improved views which actual trials have 
brought to trainers are in the direction of a greater 
naturalness. For instance, beef, in large amounts, 
and almost raw, called '^ red rags," was formerly the 
diet at all meals, and scarcely anything else, and 
was dreaded by the men undergoing training more 
than any other feature in their preparatory work, 
even than the contest itself, pugilistic or athletic. 
Perhaps this was the source of a view, wide-spread 
still through many strata of society, that one must 
eat meat to ''give him strength," and that the more 
one eats the more strength it would be sure to give 
him. The following points were obtained from a 
man who was in his younger years a pugilist, and 
afterward for many years a professional trainer. 
All are arrived at by the closest sort of trial, and 
that by men without a theory as such, book-learn- 
ing, or any sort of medical knowledge. I repeat 
them in the same axiomatic way in which these men 
speak their knowledge, whose authority is solely 
that ''they have tried it, and it is so." 

" No one should eat meat at breakfast while in 
training. A small piece of fish will do ; half a 
baked potato, well-cooked oatmeal, mush and milk. 



DIET IN TRAINING. 151 

and fruit ; neither coffee nor tea. Breakfast must 
always be a comparatively light meal. One is to rise 
from table, always, with a not fully satisfied appe- 
tite. Over-eating in the morning, and then going 
an unusual time without food, is bad. The break- 
fast must be light, and food follows work, not pre- 
cedes it, in amount at least. If a man has over- 
eaten, he had best eat again at the accustomed 
times, only very sparingly. Meanwhile, until his 
body is free of the surplus food he is carrying, let 
him go out of doors and stay, and keep up a fair 
amount of motion, walking leisurely about the 
fields, and drinking hot water when so inclined. He 
can then go on in his training the following day. 
No gain can be made while the stomach or blood is 
overloaded. Supper must also be a light meal, with- 
out cake or sweetmeats. Tea is allowable at supper, 
if made very weak. That, with a very little cold 
meat, a piece of toast, and cooked fruit, are enough. 
Sugar beyond moderate amounts is a direct detractor 
from strength ; a pure state of the constitution can- 
not be attained while it is indulged in freely. 
Meat must be cooked done, but only in certain ways, 
so as to be still juicy and red in color. Rare roast, 
or broiled in thick slices, is best. It is to be eaten 
with the second meal of the day, for then the body 
is best able to digest and dispose of it ; that is, after 
vigorous, protracted exercise, and before any con- 
siderable degree of fatigue is felt. 

'' Bread must be coarse. Trainers commonly cook 
bread for their men themselves, using of good wheat 
meal two-thirds, fresh corn meal one-third, and add- 
ing English currants. It is to be thoroughly chewed, 
and not eaten in excess. It is a good thing to drink 



152 FOOD FOR DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. 

freely of hot water an hour before breakfast, and 
then to take a walk. It should be sipped slowly, 
spending twenty-five minutes on a couple of tum- 
blersful. 

*' When it is necessary to empty the bowels at the 
beginning of a course of training, barley, boiled in 
water a short time till softened, and eaten or swal- 
lowed in some quantity, will give the bowels some- 
thing to handle which will not compact into lumps, 
and which will sweep out mucus that may be pres- 
ent, but without causing the least irritation. 

*' A shower bath is the best of all morning tonics. 
Very vigorous rubbing should immediately succeed 
— first with towels, then with the palms of the 
hands — till the flesh is perfectly soft and pink. The 
strokes of both towels and hands should be down- 
ward. Rubbing the flesh under a spray of cold 
water will give it firmness and insensibility to blows 
more rapidly than any of the astringent lotions some- 
times used. 

*'No alcohol, no beer, and especially no tobacco, 
are allowable. These are absolutely laid aside when 
training begins ; the same with coffee. When a man 
is brought to a 'pure' condition, his urine has no 
odor, and is very light colored and clear. The sweat 
has a fragrant sraell, 'something like cologne.' If 

* 

a glass of ale or spirits be taken surreptitiously, a 
trainer will know of it on the following day from 
finding that his man is not as quick and true in his 
movements as he should be, his eye is not quite 
right or accurate, and when he strips his shirt off to 
be rubbed, after his morning's work, the odor is 
'not like cologne, but bad.' An astonishing amount 
of bruise, so long as the skin is not broken, will be

absorbed and become invisible when a man is really 
in **pure" condition. Illustrations were given by 
my informant from incidents in the professional 
career of Paddy Ryan and other pugilists. This ab- 
sorption of a black and blue spot will take place 
very rapidly ; perhaps twenty-four hours or a night's 
sleep will remove all signs of recent contusions, 

**The development and the physical habits of a 
young man are formed before the age of twenty-five 
years is reached, as they can scarcely be after that 
age ; that is, the best chance to get a well-balanced 
constitution comes between the ages of eighteen and 
twenty-five years. 

**A man who has followed a trade, as a plasterer or 
an iron-worker — an active and care-taking trade, 
where all the muscles of the body are brought into 
play, instead of a single group — that man, if he go 
into training, will be a far better man to obey orders 
and regulations than a man who has had to use in 
his business only a few of his muscles. An over- 
head plasterer, who bends backward as much as for- 
ward, and pushes as well as lifts, is a good example. 
Moreover, flexors and extensors should be of equal 
development for another reason. If the flexor is the 
stronger, it acts as a strong elastic might, being not 
entirely under the control of the will, while the 
weaker opposed extensor is more or less of a lost 
power. Make the latter as large and strong as its 
opposed muscle, and the man's movements will at 
once become lighter and truer. 

'*0f my eight children, four that were raised 
while I was at home with them, and could enforce 
their having an oatmeal-and-milk breakfast and a 
light supper, grew up strong, and are alive now;

the other four had much their own way about 
food, with only their mother at home, and they all 
died about the time they reached puberty." 

No efforts, so far as I know, have been made to 
arrange a fleshless diet for men .under training; 
and so long as the general feeling of the necessity 
of flesh for athletes continues it will be useless, 
but that less and less is being used is evidence of 
a tendency this way. In England, not long ago, 
a trial was made between a trained bicycle rider 
and an amateur, the former living on a mixed diet 
and the latter on a fleshless one, of a fifty mile race, 
and there was practically no difference in the time 
they made. A few more such tests would call atten- 
tion to the subject sufficiently to make a thorough 
trial practicable. That it would demonstrate that 
man's strength can be maintained without the use 
of flesh I have no doubt. There was a time when 
it was believed that alcoholic drinks were necessary 
to maintain strength. That day has gone forever. 
I think we may predict the same result concerning 
the need of a flesh diet to maintain physical 
strength. There are too many examples of vege- 
tarian endurance and great working power to make 
any other result possible. 



CHAPTER XII. 
FOOD IN VARIOUS DISEASES. 
IN DYSPEPSIA. 

There are so many forms of dyspepsia that it would 
be quite impossible to designate, without a knowl- 
edge of each case, the foods most suitable; but 
most sufferers from this disease may be cured by 
first avoiding its causes, to wit : rapid eating with- 
out thorough mastication, and excessive work with 
muscles and brain. 

In most cases the sufferer may take more or less 
of the following articles, omitting any found to 
disagree : 

Thin vegetable soups, properly made, raw oysters 
and clams ; poached or soft boiled eggs ; 

Good brown bread and gems, made light, corn 
bread, boiled rice, rice cakes, stale bread and butter, 
macaroni, sago, tapioca, Graham crackers, oatmeal 
and barley gruel ; 

Green vegetables, such as turnip tops, spinach, 
cresses, salads, celery, sorrel, lettuce, string beans 
in moderation, dandelion, asparagus, oranges, ripe 
peaches and pears, roasted apples, thoroughly cooked 
dried fruits and grapes freely. 

Hot water abudantly, an hour before meals and 
soon after in small quantities, koumiss, buttermilk, 
milk and lime water, lemonade, milk and Vichy 

(155) 



156 FOOD IN VARIOUS DISEASES. 

water are generally useful. Hot water stimulates 
the stomach, and has cured many dyspeptics. 

In most cases, however, a simple diet made of 
brown bread, fruit and milk as a staple, and such 
other articles as will give variety and change 
are best. The dyspeptic should be cheerful at his 
meals ; tell stories and hear them ; eat leisurely and 
masticate his food thoroughly; after it is in his 
stomach he should forget that he has eaten, and 
never think of it again, if he can help it. He had 
better avoid rich soups, all fried foods, veal, pork, 
hashes, stews, turkey, all rich gravies, made dishes, 
sauces, desserts, rich pies, pastries, puddings ; crude, 
coarse vegetables ; wines, malt liquors and cordials. 

In acid dyspepsia, a most frequent and persistent 
form of the disease, the peptic glands secrete a far 
too acid gastric juice. The general opinion that 
this acid is the result of the souring of the food is, 
in my opinion, erroneous. The sour eructations ap- 
pear too soon after eating to admit of such a source. 
The usual remedy, viz.: bicarbonate of soda, 
while it gives temporary relief, never cures the 
patient; and if its use be continued for a long 
time the effects on the constitution are positively 
bad. In the first place, the blood is rendered more 
alkaline than is normal, and this too alkaline blood 
circulating along the track of the vessels for 
a long time tends to weaken them. Instead, 
therefore, of using an alkali, the true remedy is to 
masticate the food for a long time, so as to mix with 
it a large amount of saliva, which is alkaline in its 
nature and helps to neutralize the excessive acid of 
the gastric juice. Being a natural remedy it does 
not produce any injurious effects. If this be not 



IN FEVERS. 157 

sufficient, a still larger quantity of saliva may be 
produced and swallowed by chewing, after each 
meal, some simple lozenge or gum. Any sufferer 
who will thoroughly practice this will be enabled to 
relieve himself from his sufferings. 

In acid dyspepsia it is important that the bread 
be thoroughly baked. I have known some patients 
who could only eat bread twice baked, so as to 
brown each slice a little. This browning partially 
converts the starch into dextrine, which is easily 
digested. The German ziueiback is a good example 
of a twice baked bread; granula is another; still 
another is grq/io, the principal food of the inhabitants 
of the Azores. The grain is niecly roasted, but so 
as to be only slightly browned, and then ground 
into a fine flour. It may be eaten in milk or water. 
Wheat and corn in equal proportions make the best. 
Dr. C. F. Taylor speaks of this food enthusiastically, 
and mentions the fact that it proved a cure for his 
own previously obstinate acid dyspepsia. The in- 
habitants, who live mainly on gofio are exceed- 
ingly well developed physically, and capable of 
doing hard work. 

IN FEVERS. 

In fevers it is important to nourish the patient 
wisely and carefully. He may generally take In- 
dian gruel, Graham flour gruel, oatmeal and barley 
flour gruel, baked milk toast, flaxseed tea and rice 
and milk. 

In typhoid fever, milk and koumyss may consti- 
tute the principal foods. The juices of fruits, es- 
pecially grapes, peaches, oranges and lemons are 
generally admissable. Sometimes there is a crav- 



158 ' FOOD IN VARIOUS DISEASES. 

ing for some particular food, in which case it is gen- 
erally best to allow it. I once had a patient very ill 
with fever, who begged for lettuce and vinegar, and 
would take nothing else until I had given him that 
which was desired ; it was relished and did him 
good. 

The drinks in fever should be pure soft water in 
abundance, rice water, currant jelly water, lemon- 
ade, gum arable water, orange juice and koumyss. 
Milk, plain or peptonized, guarded with lime water, 
may be used to great advantage when pure milk 
disagrees. Drinks made from the juices of fruits in 
their season may be used as the taste and condition 
of the patient demand. 

■ DIET IN CONSTIPATION. 

Constipation may almost always be cured by the 
use of brown bread — not taken occasionally, but 
regularly — and fruit, together with such other arti- 
cles as are digestible and nutritious. 

All fresh vegetables, vegetables with salad oil, 
boiled spinach and boiled dandelion are appropriate. 

Stewed prunes, stewed figs, tamarinds, baked sour 
apples, dried fruits, such as apples, peaches and 
pears ; melons, grapes — in short, fruits, generally. 
Oranges on rising in the morning are excellent. 

Drink pure soft water abundantly, and especially 
before meals ; a glass of hot water an hour before 
meals will be useful; new eggs, buttermilk and 
lemonade are not objectionable, only never overload 
the stomach with them. 

Avoid salt or smoked fish or meat, peas, beans, 
pickles, pastry, tea, alcoholic drinks and cheese. 

See under the head of *^Rye," a method of treat- 
ing obstinate cases. 



IN BRIGHT's disease — RHEUMATISM. 159 



IN BRIGHT's DISEASE. 



In this disease a plain, nutritious vegetable diet, 
including milk, is preferable. Raw oysters and 
clams may be used. Good brown bread and all 
farinaceous articles, well cooked, may be used in 
moderation in their turn, including, of course, rice, 
hominy, v/heaten grits, toast, oatmeal and gruels. 

Of vegetables, use in their season spinach, celery, 
water cress and lettuce. 

Of drinks, it is of the utmost importance to have 
pure soft water-^distilled water would be preferable. 
Fresh milk should be used. I have known a patient 
almost beyond hope with Bright's disease appar- 
ently recover on a diet of bread and milk, with a 
little fruit, and another on a diet of new milk alone. 
Such a diet relieves the kidneys of much of their 
labor, and gives nature an opportunity to repair any 
injury of these organs. More can be done to cure 
this disease by diet and hygiene than by drugs. 

Let the patient avoid pastry and every form of 
food not easily digestible. If flesh is used it should 
be only in the greatest moderation. 

CHRONIC RHEITMATISM. 

In chronic or semi-acute rheumatism depend on 
a vegetable diet, especially brown bread, spinach, 
celery, salads, cresses and all sorts of acid fruits. 

Drink pure soft water, hot or cold, in abundance. 

Avoid fried fish, cooked oysters and clams, pork, 
veal, turkey, potatoes ; all gravies and made dishes 
and fried dishes ; excess of nitrogenous food ; beer 
and all malt liquors, wines, etc. 

In rheumatism, a vegetarian diet will, in most 



160 FOOD IN VARIOUS DISEASES. 

cases, give great relief, and other hygienic measures 
will complete the cure, where a cure is possible. A 
most persistent case of semi-acute rheumatism, 
which had defied medical skill and Turkish baths 
combined, coming under my care as a last resource, 
has been entirely cured by diet, with one bath each 
week. The bill of fare prescribed was : For break- 
fast — oatmeal porridge, whole meal bread and butter, 
fruit, cocoa or weak tea ; for dinner — whole meal 
bread and butter, fruit and vegetables, especially rice 
in every form, and baked potatoes; for supper — 
whole meal bread, butter and tea, and fruit if de- 
sired. Flesh was forbidden, also all spirituous 
drinks. A sun bath, with massage and the rubbing 
of oil on the affected parts, was advised daily, and 
a Turkish bath weekly. Of course exposure to cold 
and damp were to be avoided, and medicines given 
up. Treatment was to be continued six months at 
least. In that time the patient became well and 
strong. A very large proportion of sufferers from 
rheumatism may cure themselves by the same or 
similar means. It only requires perseverance and 
good hygienic conditions. It is essential to have 
the best of whole meal bread. Thorough mastica- 
tion is also essential. Over eating must be avoided. 
Gentle exercise is desirable. 

DIET IN CORPULENCE. 

In corpulence exercise is of the utmost importance, 
and especially exercises that bring air into the 
lungs to burn up the excess of fat. Vegetables 
and farinaceous foods are preferable. Moderation 
is advised, but very rarely practiced by the patient. 
Brown bread is always to be eaten. Baked or boiled 



IN GOUT — DIABETES. 161 

potatoes, peas, beans, asparagus, cauliflower, celery, 
cresses, spinach, cabbage, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, 
radishes, squash, turnips, grapes, oranges, cherries 
and acid fruits may be used freely. The grape cure, 
previously mentioned, will prove useful. 

Pure soft water should be taken freely ; indeed, it 
had better be the only drink. 

IN GOUT. 

In gout use about the same food as in rheumatism. 
Eat sparingly and exercise as much as possible in 
order to promote excretion. Live on ten cents a 
day and earn it. 

DIABETES. 

In diabetes use as the only bread, gluten bread, so 
excellently made now by many health food com- 
panies, eggs and butter; green vegetables, such as 
summer cabbage, turnip tops, spinach, water cresses, 
mustard, sauerkraut, lettuce, sorrel, mushrooms, 
celery, string beans, dandelion, cold slaw, Brussels 
sprouts, cucumbers, asparagus, truffles, radishes, 
onions, olives and olive oil, eggs, etc. 

Drink pure soft water, koumyss, buttermilk and 
acid fruit juices. 

Avoid sweet milk, liver, ordinary bread, toast; 
farinaceous vegetables, such as potatoes, rice, oat- 
meal, corn meal, sago, tapioca, arrowroot, etc. ; 
saccharine vegetables, such as turnips, parsnips, 
carrots, green peas, French beans, beet root, toma- 
toes; sweet fruits of all kinds; all preserves, syrups, 
sugars, cocoa, chocolate, cordials, sweet wines ; al- 
pastry, puddings, ice cream and honey. 



162 FOOD IN VARIOUS DISEASES. 

A flesii diet is generally advised in diabetes, but 
according to Dr. Hofmeister, an exclusive meat diet 
in this disease is dangerous. Diabetics ought to 
conscienciously masticate every mouthful of food, 
so as to mix it well v^ith saliva to make its diges- 
tion perfect. 

IN DIARRHEA AND SUMMER COMPLAINTS. 

In these diseases gruels made from baked flour 
will be useful. Boiled milk is also often suitable. 
I have found that blackberries stewed with sugar 
and water, the juice poured off and taken freely is 
a sovereign cure for diarrhea. Sometimes the juice 
of peaches and strawberries. or any acid dried fruit 
will answer the same purpose if the blackberry can- 
not be obtained. I advise that blackberries be dried 
and kept for emergencies of this kind. Pure water 
should be provided; and if the water be not pure 
it should be boiled or distilled. Rusks made from 
twice baked bread are excellent ; they may be taken 
with fresh milk. 

In diarrhea avoid all crude, indigestible food, and 
all hard or tainted water. 

IN CONSUMPTION. 

In consumption, the diet should be nutritious and 
easily digested. Raw oysters, clams, new milk, 
cream, eggs, butter, olive oil, the best of brown 
bread from good wheat (that from which the exter- 
nal cuticle has been removed being preferred), corn 
bread, rye bread and rice ; spinach, asparagus, let- 
tuce, cresses, celery, tomatoes and greens ; fruits, if

they agree, and baked potatoes may be taken as 
they are found adapted to the case. 

For drinks — hot water, Vichy, pure, soft, spring 
water, fresh milk just from a healthy cow, 
goat's milk if the stomach bears it well, and cocoa 
rather than tea or coffee. 

In this dreadful disease the nutritive organs are 
generally weak and assimilation is poor, so every- 
thing that can be done to keep them strong should 
be done. The fact that air is a food should never 
be lost sight of in the treatment of this disease, and 
every effort should be made to get as much of it 
into the lungs as possible. This is best accomplished 
by a life in the open air, by horseback riding, by 
rowing, and by such gymnastic exercises for the 
chest as will expand and enlarge it. When the 
season will permit it, the consumptive may even 
sleep out of doors, in tents or protected places to 
advantage. I know a lady given over to incurable 
lung disease, who for several years has slept in a 
good hammock in the veranda of her summer home 
during several months each season, to manifest ad- 
vantage to her health, the object being to secure an 
abundance of pure fresh air. 

Avoid all indigestible food, including pastry, hot 
bread, etc. 

DIET IN NERVOUS DISEASES. 

In nervous diseases the patient may choose from 
a large variety of foods to suit any notion or fancy 
that takes possession of his mind. In most cases it 
is preferable for the nervous invalid to confine him- 
self to a wisely-chosen vegetable diet ; good brown 



164 FOOD IN VARIOUS DISEASES. 

bread, milk, cream, butter, eggs, oatmeal, salads 
and fruits will constitute the principal articles. Of 
vegetables, baked potatoes, sweet potatoes, cresses, 
lettuce and celery will all be useful. 

Drinks may be chosen from pure soft water in 
abundance, either hot or cold, cocoa, milk and the 
juice of fruits, especially orange and lemonade. 

DIET IN CANCER. 

Cancer is a disease more frequent among those 
who live high than among those who live low, and 
it is comparatively rare among those whose food is 
mainly drawn from the vegetable kingdom. Several 
cases of its cure have been recorded by adopting an 
abstemious vegetable diet, mainly one of fruit and 
bread, with a little milk or cream. This seems rea- 
sonable, at least, especially in the early stages of 
the malady ; at any rate, the experiment is well 
worth trying, particularly in connection with other 
hygienic conditions, which cannot be mentioned 
here. 

ULCERATION OF THE STOMACH. 

This rare disease requires the greatest care in 
diet. Milk, either with or without lime water? 
comes nearest to the requirements of any food. 
It is bland and unirritating, which is important. 
But little should be taken at a time — a teaspoonful, 
or even less, is enough at first. This may be re- 
peated in an hour, and so on through the day. In 
increasing the amount use the greatest care, so as 
not to bring on a relapse. Of course such a meagre 
diet will not support the patient perfectly ; but if he 



FOR THE THIN — MARASMUS. 165 

avoids all expenditure of strength so far as possible, 
it will keep him from starvation until nature heals 
the ulcer, which will not take very long. Some of 
the worst cases have been cured by this diet. 

MARASMUS. 

Marasmus and wasting diseases I have found, es- 
pecially in the young, if over two years of age, best 
overcome by the use of whole meal gems and new 
milk and the juices of stewed fruits, especially the 
juice of stewed dried apples cooked with some sugar. 
At first the bread may be soaked in the milk; much 
of its valuable salts and other soluble matter will in 
a little time be dissolved. Such cases usually need 
oil, and it is best applied hot on the skin in the form 
of an oil bath. It is wonderful how much will be 
absorbed by a starving child's skin in a day. I have 
treated a few of the most hopeless cases in this way 
with most excellent results. It requires the aid, 
however, of the most faithful mother or nurse, will- 
ing to co-operate with the physician, to produce the 
best effects. The general feeling that such sufferers 
require raw meat has demoralized people so much 
that not everv mother will trust to such treatment 
until all others have failed. 

DIET FOR THE THIN. 

Some people are constitutionally inclined to be 
thin, as others are to be fat, and it is almost im. 
possible to change their nature. I remember once 
owning a horse that would not take on flesh. He 
was very high spirited, always uneasy and inclined 
to go. His nervous system was excitable, irritable. 



166 FOOD IN VARIOUS DISEASES. 

The sight of a whip would cause him to spring for- 
ward with a bound. An uncle of mine, whose horses 
were always fat and sleek, told me I must quiet 
down his nervous system if I wanted him to take 
on flesh, and he told me how to do it. Following 
his directions I changed the slender, excitable creat- 
ure to one quite round and gentle. With many hu- 
man beings there exists the same difficulty. They 
are lean by nature, perhaps, and never easy or 
restful. Their nervous systems need to be quieted 
and calmed ; then they may increase in flesh. Their 
food should contain more fat and starch than that 
for persons of an opposite tendency. Cream, milk, 
sugar, cocoa, butter, etc., may, with other articles 
of a similar nature, be used freely, providing they 
agree with the stomach and are well borne. 

DIET FOR INEBRIATES. 

The diet for inebriates is most difficult to manage, 
as such patients have perverted their normal sense 
of taste so that simple, nutritious food has lost all its 
charms. Something is demanded which will make 
a strong impression on the nerves, as pepper, salt 
and other condiments. So long as this perversion 
continues a radical cure is difficult. On this account 
it is highly important that the inebriate and, in 
fact, all who are addicted to strong drinks, makes 
every effort to re-establish a natural sense of taste, 
a love for simple, nutritious, but unstimulating 
food, and especially for the finest fruits in their 
season. It would be well for him to begin every 
meal with an orange, or with some very fine grapes, 
or a perfect melon ; to abstain from all spices and 



FOOD FOR ORPHAN ASYLUMS, ETC. 167 

condiments, except a little salt, and to persevere in 
this for a long time. I do not say that it will cure 
the confirmed inebriate ; but it will aid materially, 
and many cases not confirmed may be prevented 
from becoming so. As I have said elsewhere, the 
sanitarian and the cook have an important mission 
in stemming the tide of intemperance; and they 
have also an equally important work in helping to 
cure the victims of alcohol. The hot water cure for 
inebriates is to be recommended. 

FOOD FOR ORPHAN ASYLUMS, PRISONS, ETC. 

Orphans condemned to live in asylums should be 
fed better than they are, and a rightly constituted 
vegetable diet would be most beneficial. Of course 
if the diet adopted be not wisely selected it will fail ; 
but if wisely selected it will not fail. 

In Mr. Fegan's Homes for Boys, in London, it was 
adopted several years since with great benefit, and 
he now writes concerning it as follows : 

'*I am often asked if the boys in our Homes are 
still fed on a ' non-flesh ' diet, and if so, how we find 
this system (for after three years' experience it can 
hardly be stillcalled an experiment) to answer. I 
take this opportunity of explaining that our boys 
have been living on a * Vegetarian ' dietary since 
the spring of 1885, with great advantage to their 
general health. Many of the boys in our Homes 
come from a weakly stock ; many of them have had 
their constitutions debilitated by neglect and ex- 
posure ; yet the incontestable fact remains that the 
general health of the boj^s is not only better than in 
ordinary families, but better than it has ever been 



168 FOOD IN VARIOUS DISEASES. 

before in our Homes. If our boys, instead of being 
brought up as the elder ones are, in a densely popu- 
lated neighborhood like Southwark, were reared in 
the suburbs or country, I suppose sickness of any 
kind would hardly ever be known amongst them. 
I am sure that our medical officer will bear me out 
that the appearance of the boys has greatly im- 
proved, and that with a truly remarkable immunity 
from ailments of all kinds during the last three 
years. It must be remembered that we use only 
whole meal bread, and that every meal is ad lib.'' 

If boys are to be reformed they must be well fed, 
whether their food is mixed or not. Indeed, it is 
a crime to feed them on cheap or insufficient food, 
as is too often the case. They should always have 
whole meal wheaten bread, butter, milk, eggs, fruit, 
potatoes, oatmeal, corn meal and cocoa as much as 
they require. 

PURE FOOD. 

Pure food is very important, and the consumer 
must consider this. Impurities that pass into the 
blood continue their course with the nourishment 
to the very minutest ramifications of the blood- 
vessels, and even into the so called cells, cannot 
promote nutrition, but, on the contrary, retard and 
prevent it. 

Much has been said of late concerning diseased 
flesh and milk as causes of consumption. We have 
yet no reliable facts as to whether this disease 
may really be transferred by flesh and milk from 
animals to man, though the probabilities favor it. 
But even if there be no real danger, none of us feel 



CLIMATE AND SEASONS. 169 

like eating diseased flesh or milk, even when well 
cooked. There is no doubt that the danger from 
impure and diseased food is greater than from dis- 
eased vegetables ; though in the latter we are not 
altogether free. It requires thoughtfulness and 
painstaking to always secure pure food, and it is 
worth all the trouble it costs. 

CLIMATE AND SEASONS. 

Climate and seasons have a marked influence on 
the amount and kind of food demanded. In cold 
seasons and regions more hydrocarbons and fats are 
required than in warm climates and parts of the 
year. The extra amount is needed to restore the loss 
of animal heat by exposure to the cold. To some 
extent, however, we modify this by clothing, warm 
houses, etc. Those who pay most attention to this 
subject in temperate regions, as soon as the winter 
gives place to spring demand fresh vegetables, sal- 
ads and articles rich in water and mineral salts, and 
this is a wise thing for all. . To those, however, 
who provide an abundant supply of fruit for every 
season of the year, and who do not during winter 
eat heavy meals of indigestible food there is less 
need of this than for others. 

COOKERY. 

Cookery should be both a science and an art. The 
cook should be educated, should know the value of 
all foods, know how to combine them in order to 
procure a suitable proportion of all their ingredients 
for the daily needs of the body, and how to pre- 
serve and bring out their best qualities and proper- 



170 FOOD IN VARIOUS DISEASES. 

ties. Men as well as women should learn the art 
and the science of of preparing food properly. Wo- 
men are more inclined to take to the art side of the 
subject, and men to the science of it. A combina- 
tion of their knowledgde and of their tastes is pre- 
ferable to either alone. The fundamental principles 
of all cookery should have their foundations laid 
deep in knowledge. This would render the subject 
a delight instead of as now, a drudgery. 



RECIPES. 



SOUPS. 

Soups are often complicated and expensive, requiring much monej, 
time, and attention to prepare them. Tliese difficulties are avoided ir 
the following recipes, and a few trials will enable any one of ordinary 
understanding, who will follow the directions, to produce cheap, 
wholesome, and agreeable Boups, without shins, knuckles, scrags, 
bacon, or drippings. 

Split Pea Soup. — Put one pint of split peas, which have been 
previously soaked in cold water four hours, into two quarts of pure 
soft water. Let them boil for one hour, then add one carrot, one par- 
snip, one turnip, two onions, a small head of celery, and a little mint, 
all cut small, and boil the whole another hour. Strain the soup from 
the vegetables, and thicken it with a little Indian meal, previously 
mixed in cold water ; boil the whole for ten minutes more, and serve 
in a tureen with toasted or plain wheat-meal bread. Mix the vege- 
tables well, and put them into a mould or a basin, and then into a 
vegetable-dish, and serve it with steamed or baked potatoes. Salt 
moderately. 

Bean Soup. — Wash and pick over one pint of white beans ; steep 
them twenty-four hours in pure soft water, put them into a stew-pan 
(earthen and enameled is best), set them on the lire in two quarts of 
water, let them boil for two hours, then add two onions, one parsnip, 
one carrot, a little parsley and thyme cut small, a little cold boiled 
rice, and a little salt. Boil the whole gently for another hour, and 
serve it the same as pea soup. Salt to taste. 

Barley and Bread Soup. — Take three ounces of barley, one and a 
half ounces of stale bread-crumbs, one and a half ounces of butter, 
one-half ounce of salt, and one-quarter ounce of parsley. Wash and 
steep tiie barley for twelve hours, in one-half pint of water, to which 
a piece of carbonate of soda, the size of a pea, has been added ; then 
pour off the water not absorbed, and add the crumbs of stale bread, 
three quarts of boiling water, and the salt. Digest these in a salt- 
glazed covered jar, in the oven, or boil them slowly in a well-tinned 
covered pan, for from four to six hours, adding the chopped parsley, 
with the butter, thirty minutes before the expiration of the time of 
boiling. 

(171) 



172 KEOIPES. 

Btiown Soup. — One pound of turnips, one pound of carrots, lialf a 
pound and six ounces of onions, one and a half pints of peas, four 
oances of butter, and half a pound of bread. Cut the vegetables into 
small pieces, put them in a pan with the butter, cover the pan, and let 
them stew over the fire till brown occasionally stirring them ; put in 
the peas with the water in which they were boiled ; add sufficient 
boiling water to make three quarts altogether ; next add the bread, 
which should be browned or toasted before the fire, but not burnt ; 
season, and let the soup boil gently for three or four hours ; rub it 
through a coarse sieve, return it into the pan ; let it boil, and it will be 
ready to serve. If dried peas are used, they should be steeped for 
twenty-four hours in soft water, and boiled for two hours. 

Barley Soup. — Three ounces of barley, one and a half ounces ol 
stale bread crumbs, one ounce of butter, quarter of an ounce of chop- 
ped parsley, and half an ounce of salt. Wash, and steep the barley 
for twelve hours in half a pint of water, to which a piece of soda, the 
size of a pea, has been added ; pour off the water that is not absorbed ; 
add the bread crumbs, three quarts of boiling water, and the salt ; boil 
slowly in a well-tinned covered pan for four or five hours, and add the 
parsley and butter about half an hour before the soup is ready to be 
served. 

Celery Soup. — Six roots of celery, one large turnip, two ouficea 
of onions, four ounces of bread crumbs, one ounce of butter, one des- 
sert-spoonful of flour, and half a pint of cream. Strip off all the green 
part of the celery, using only the white ; cut it in shreds, reserving 
the inside of three of tlie roots to be added afterward ; slice the turnip 
and onion, and put them with the celery into a pan ; add two quarts 
of water, the bread crumbs, and a little salt ; let all boil till the vege- 
tables are perfectly soft ; rub through a sieve ; return it to the pan ; 
add the celery (previously boiled till quite soft), the butter, and flour, 
well mixed ; stir it, seasoning it with a little mace ; and, after boiling 
a quarter of an hour, stir in the cream, but do not allow it to boil 
afterward. 

Browning for Soups. — Three large spoonfuls of brown sugar; 
one half pint of boiling water. Put the sugar into a frying-pan, set it 
on the fire to brown, stirring it with a wooden spoon, that it may not 
burn. When sufficiently dark-colored, stir into in the boiling water ; 
when thoroughly mixed put it into a bottle ; and, when cold, cork it 
closely down, and use a tablespoonful or more, as may be required, to 
give a color to your soup. A burnt onion or two can be made of use 
for the purpose of browning, and is often considered better than the 
above recipe. 

Note.— For the convenience of those who have not an opportunity of -weighing 
the ingredients for the sonps, it may be etated that one large tablespoonful will be 
about equal to one ounce, and one teasponf ul to a quarter of an ounce. But weigh- 
ing should be resorted to whenever it is possible. 

Potato Soup. — One quart of potatoes, pared and cut into small 
strips or blocks, a large sprig of parsley, the same of thyme or sweet 
marjoram, cut fine ; boil three-fourths of an hour in three quarts of 



RECIPES. 173 

water, then add half a pint of cream or new milk ; put a small table- 
spoonful of butter into a plate where it will soften, and stir into it 
two spoonsful of flour, add to the soup, and boil five minutes. Drop- 
dumplings made with a little flour and cream, yeast and milk are an 
addition. 

Green-Pea Soup. — Take two quarts of green-peas, one small 
onion, and a sprig of parsley cut fine ; add two quarts of hot water, 
and boil slowly for half an hour, then add a pint of small new potatoes 
which have been peeled and laid in cold water an hour ; put in a table- 
spoonful of sugar and a little salt, boil till the potatoes are done, now 
add a teacupful of cream or a pint of milk, boil a minute or two, 
and serve with small slices of toasted bread or gems cut in halves. 

Tomato Soup — Take two quarts of fresh, round tomatoes, scald 
and peel, without breaking ; do not cut or fork them. Put into a 
porcelain kettle, or fire-proven stone vessel, add two quarts of boiling 
water, and a teaspoonful of salt, and set on the fire or in the oven, 
cover, and let them stew slowly three quarters of an hour. Mix two 
tablespoons ful of flour with a tablespoonf ul of butter, or a teacupful 
of good cream, which has been boiled, stir into the soup, and let it boil 
together ten minutes, and dish up with small thin slices of well-toast- 
ed bread. Be careful to let the tomatoes remain whole, as you would 
oysters. 

A teacupful of grated corn added to the soup when you put in the 
flour, etc., will be an excellent addition, and render the imitation of 
oyster soup more complete. Simmer the corn only ten minutes, if it is 
fresh and full of milk. 

NoTK. — We give you only one or two meat soups, and thepe with special refer- 
ence to tomatoes. Meat soups are well known in almost endless varieties, but good 
vegetable soups are j-curce. 

Beep and Tomato Soup. — Take two pounds of red beef — a neck 
piece, or from the round ; carefully remove all the fat, and cut the 
meat into small bits ; put into a stewpan with two quarts of cold 
water, and simmer slowly one hour. Remove all the scum as soon as 
it rises, and keep covered close. Scald until quite soft, one quart of 
nice ripe tomatoes, and press through a colander ; add to the broth 
from which you have removed the meat, and boil half an hour ; put 
in a sprig of sweet marjoram or thyme, then take two ears of swee- 
corn, and cut and scrape all the kernels from the cob, also two table 
spoonsful of flour and one of sugar, browned but not burned, mix with 
half a teacupful sweet cream or milk ; add these ingredients and boil 
fifteen minutes. Season with a little salt and cayenne pepper. 

NoTB. — You will observe that all the ingredients of this soup require but little 
actual cooking. The pure nutriment of beef is found with rare cooking. Tomatoes 
lose their fine flavor by much boiling, and com hardens at a certain period — fifteen 
or twenty minutes, if it is fresh and full of milk, is sufficient to cook corn. 

Another. — Make a soup of bones or bits of meat left from a roast, 
add a little cabbage, sweet potato, and parsley cut fine, boil till well 
done, then cut or grate a pint of green corn and half a dozen fresh 



174 RECIPES. 

tomatoes, boil these with the soup fifteen or twenty miuntes, and 
serve. 

Note — Eemove all the fat from the meat before putting it into the water, and 
Bkim off what remains as soon as it rises. This is far more wholesome and relish- 
able than stock prepared some days beforehand. Stale meats are the same, even in 
soup. 

Vermicelli Soup. — Six ounces of vermicelli, two quarts of new 
milk, the' yolks of four eggs, and one pint of cream. Blanch the ver- 
micelli by setting it on the fire in cold water ; when it boils, drain off 
the water, and put it into cold water ; let it remain a few minutes, and 
then drain the water entirely from it ; put it into a pan with the milk, 
and boil it ; beat up the yolks of the eggs, and after gradually adding 
a pint of boiled cream, strain through a sieve. Take off the pan ; add 
the eggs, cream, a small lump of white sugar, and a tea-spoonful of 
salt, and stir the soup on the fire till near boiling. 

Barley Broth. — Four ounces of Scotch barley, four ounces of 
onions, four ounces of oat-meal, or Indian meal, and two ounces of 
butter. After washing the barley well, steep it in fresh water for 
twelve hours ; set it on the fire in two quarts of water, adding the 
onions and a little salt, and boil gently fo** an hour and a quarter. 
Melt the butter in a saucepan ; stir in the meal till it becomes a paste ; 
then add a little of the broth gradually, till it is a proper thickness to 
mix with the whole quantity ; stir well together till it boils, and mix 
with a little of the broth a drachm of celery seed, pounded ; stir well 
in the broth ; simmer it gently a quarter of an hour longer, and serve. 

PORRIDGES. 

Wheat-meal Porridge. — Having boiled one quart of soft water, 
and mixed half a pound of meal in a little cold water, mix them to- 
gether, and boil for fifteen minutes, stirring it occasionally. Pour it 
into basins and let it stand for ten minutes. To be eaten with fruit, 
sugar or molasses, and bread. 

Indian-meal Porridge. — Make same as the wheat-meal porridge, 
only that it must be cooked for nearly an hour, and be made thinner, 
to allow for the evaporation which comes from the boiling. 

Indian Farina Porridge. — To one pint of boiling water add four 
tablespoonf ul of farina ; mix and serve the same as the wheat-meal 
porridge. 

Arrowroot Porridge, — Mix one ounce of prepared arrowroot with 
a tablespoonsful of cold water, then pour boiling water on it to make it 
the required thickness, stirring it well at the same time. A slice or 
two of lemon with a little sugar will be found an improvement. To 
be eaten with crackers or bread. 

Boiled Wheat Porridge, — Having soaked over night one pound 
of good wheat in pure soft water, strain the water off and add a quart 
of fresh ; stew it gently till quite soft. It may be eaten as wheat-mea 
porridge. 



RECIPES. 1 75 

Sago PoimrDGE. — Four tablespoonsf ul of sago, one salt-spoonfuls of 
salt, and one quart of water. Soak the sago in cold water for a few 
minutes, and boil it gently about an hour, adding the salt; pour it into 
soup-plates, and serve with molasses or sugar. 

Sago and Rice Porridge. — Equal quantities of sago and ground 
rice. Proceed as with sago porridge. 

Milk Porridge. — Take of new milk a pint and a half, and half a 
pint of water ; place it over the fire. When just ready to boil, stir in a 
tablespoonful of flour, wheat-meal, oat-meal, or Indian corn-meal, pre- 
viously mixed with a little water; after boiling a minute pour it on 
bread cut into small pieces. As milk burns quicker than almost any 
other article of food, it is always best to put it into a tin pail or fa- 
rina kettle, which is or can be surrounded by boiling water while heat- 
ing, then you are sure of not burning it. 

Arrowroot Ghuel. — Take one ounce of arrowroot, and two large 
tablespoonsful of preserved black currants. Put the currants into a 
pan with a quart of water; cover the pan and let them stew gently 
about half an hour ; then strain the liquid and set it on the fire; when 
boiling pour it gradually upon the arrowroot, previously mixed with a 
little cold water, stirring it well; return it into the pan and let it boil 
for a few minutes gently, adding sugar if required. 

S.-^-GO Gruel. — Take two tablespoonsful of sago and one quart of 
water. Wash and soak the sago a few minutes in cold water; stir it 
into the rest of the water when boiling; boil slowly till the sago is 
well done, and add sugar and nutmeg as required. 

Tapioca Gruel. — Wash a tablespoonful of tapioca and soak it in a 
pint and a half of water twenty minutes; then boil gently, stirring 
frequently, till it is sufl3[ciently cooked, and sweeten. 

Groat Gruel. — Pick the groats very clean and steep them in water 
for several hours ; then boil them in soft water till quite tender and 
thick, and add boiling water suflBcient to reduce the whole to the con- 
sistency of gruel, also currants, sugar, and grated nutmeg. Groats are 
made of oats* grain, the hulls being removed and the grain left quite 
whole, as are all preparations of this grain. This gruel is very nutri- 
tious. 

REMARKS AND RULES FOR GOOD BREAD. 

With good flour, a good oven, and a good, sensible, interested cook, 
we can be pretty sure of good, wholesome bread. Yeast bread is con- 
sidered the standard bread, and is, perhaps, more generally found on 
every table than any other kind. Hence it is important to know how 
to make good, sweet, wholesome, yeast bread. Good flour is the first 
indispensable, then good, lively yeast, either yeast cakes or bottled, 
the former is preferable in all respects. Then, of course, there must 
be the proper materials to work with. A bread bowl or pan — the pan 
is easiest kept clean — a stone or earthen jar for setting the sponge; a 
sieve — flour should always be sifted before making bread of any kind 



176 RECIPES. 

first, to be sure that it is perfectly clean, secondly, sifting enlivens and 
aerates the flour, and makes both mixing and rising easier and quicker; 
a clean, white cloth to cover the dough, and a woollen blanket to keep 
the dough of even temperature while rising; baking pans, deep aud 
shallow, a large, strong spoon for stirring, and a little melted suet oi 
fresh butter for oiling the pans ; never use poor butter. If you want 
shortening, rich milk or cream scalded and cooled will answer the pur- 
pose and be most wholesome. But thorough kneading is better still, 
and should always be done effectually. Scalding a portion of the flour 
makes a sweeter bread and speeds the work. Water, milk, or butter — 
milk may be poured boiling hot on a quart or two of the flour, stirring 
well, and cooling to a moderate temperature before adding the yeast — 
this makes the sponge. Scalded flour always makes a little darker 
bread, unless we use buttermilk, which makes a rich, creamy, white 
bread. Yeast is fermented flour or meal— the first stages of decompo- 
sition or decay. Understanding this, every baker will comprehend the 
necessity of regulating the extent of the fermentation with the great- 
est care: for a sponge or bread fermented or " raised " too long, is de- 
composing, spoiling — actually rotting 1 This is the language of an ex- 
perienced English baker to us only a few days ago, during a talk about 
the delicate, foamy loaves "yeasted to death," which so many families 
are eating and calling "the staff of life," quite discarding the firm, 
sweet, substantial, home-made loaf which our mothers and grand- 
mothers kneaded with their own skilled hands. Bread-making should 
stand at the head of domestic accomplishments : since the health and 
happiness of the family depends incalculably upon good bread ; and 
there comes a time in every true, thoughtful woman's experience when 
she is glad she can make nice, sweet loaves, free from soda, alum, and 
other injurious ingredients, or an earnest regret that she neglected 
or was so unfortunate as not to have been taught at least what are the 
requisites of good bread-making. 

Yeast. — Dry yeast or yeast cakes are more convenient and less liable 
to taste in the bread than bakers' yeast. Two or three times a year 
there should be a fresh supply of yeast cakes prepared and carefully 
put in a dry place. Yeast cakes are manufactured and sold, some of 
which are very reliable. To make dry yeast, steep for half an hour a 
handful of fresh hops in a quart of boiling water. Sift two quarts of 
flour in an earthen or stone pan, and strain into the flour the hoiling 
hop tea. Stir well and let it cool, when lukewarm add a cent's worth 
of baker's yeast or a cupful of good home-made yeast, and put in a 
tablespoonf ul of brown sugar, a tablespoonf ul of ginger, a teaspoonf ul 
of salt, mix thoroughly and let it rise. It is best to prepare this sponge 
over night, and early in the morning it will be rounded up and light, 
and give you all day, which should be sunny and breezy, to make and 
dry the yeast cakes. Now mix into the sponge as much good corn 
meal as will make a stiff, firm dough, knead it well and make it into a 
long, round roll three or four inches in diameter. Cut it into slices 
half an inch thick, spread a clean cloth or clean paper on a board and 
lay the cakes on and put into a light, airy place to dry. Turn them 
Beveral times during the day, and speed the drying as fast as possible, 
as the fermentation goes on while they remain moist. When dry put

into a bag made of firm linen or cotton, tie close, and liang high and 
dry. 

Bread with Scalded Sponge. — Set your sponge the last thing at 
night, thus : put one veast cake to soften in a half cup of warm water, 
sift two quarts of flour into a bowl or pan that will hold four quarts, 
scald the riour with a sufficient quantity of boiling water to moisten it 
all. Stir very thoroughly till it is free from lumps and cool enough to 
put in the yeast cake, add the yeast, and set to rise in a warm place in 
winter, or in a cool place in summer. In the morning before breakfast 
the sponge will be risen round and foamy, and should be made imme- 
diately into dough. Sift as much flour as you need into your bread 
bowl or pan, and in cold weatlier to warm the flour will gain you time 
and credit. If you wish to make a Graham loaf or two, save one-third 
of the sponge for that, and mix the rest into the sifted and warmed 
flour, add a pint of warm water, or sufficient to make the flour into a 
firm dough, and knead until smooth and free from the board and hands. 
Put the dough back into the bread pan, cover with a clean cloth, and 
wrap a warmed blanket over the whole to keep from the air. The 
more muffled you wrap it the sooner the bread will rise. If the tem- 
perature has been just right, the bread will be ready to mold into the 
baking tins in less than two hours. Have the pans cleaned and greased* 
divide the dough into loaves which will two-thirds fill the pan, knead 
lightly with a little flour on the board, but use no more than you can 
help. Cover slightly and let it rise again till the loaf looks as large as 
it should be. Now the oven should be hot, with a firm steady fire, 
which will last three quarters of an hour ; fresh fuel ought not to be 
added till the bread is finished. Every cook should know just what 
her oven will do, and be governed accordingly ; if too hot at the bottom 
set the pan up an inch, if too hot at the top cover the loaf with brown 
paper, open the oven as little as possible. When baked, remove the 
loaf at once from the pan and put to cool on a rack, or resting it on 
one edge. Never cover or allow bread to sweat in the baking tins, the 
crusts will soften as they cool. Good flour and properly made bread 
will not have hard crusts. When cold, wrap the bread in the bread 
cloth and put into a tray or into a clean tin boiler, cover, but not air- 
tight. Bread thus made will be good and fresh for several days. 

Remark. — The keen fermenting odor which starts up when the 
dough is ready for the second kneading is not sour, nor does it need 
soda. Soda kills the lively quality of yeast. 

Yeast Graham Bread. — Take the remainder of the white flour 
sponge, a tablespoonful of sugar, and three pints of warm water ; mix 
with them Graham flour into as stiff a dough as you can stir well with 
a large spoon. Beat it up thoroughly for ten minutes, or, if you can- 
not manage the spoon, dip the hand into water, and work the dough 
till it is very smooth. Let it rise two hours, then stir it up and put it 
into deep baking-tins, and let it stand till it begins to rise again. Bake 
in a quick oven one hour. Graham flour ferments quicker than fine 
flour, and should not be allowed to rise so long. If, when the bread is 
cold, it seems too soft, remember, the next time, to mix the dough a 



178 BECIPES. 

little stiffer. The precise consistency cannot be guessed a) ways, as 
some wheat works softer than others. The sweetening can be left out 
with propriety. Indeed, we never could see why Graham tiour should 
be sweetened at all, as it has all the sugar of the grain left in, while 
fine flour has had the sugar taken out by the process of bolting. 

Bread with Potatoes. — Potatoes assist fermentation, and render 
the dough lighter and more tender when we wish to make bread in 
haste. Peel and boil, or steam, a quart of potatoes^ mash them very 
fine, or, what is better, press them through a colander while they are 
hot, add half a pint of water and a salt-spoonful of salt, stir them into 
a batter, and then put in a yeast cake previously softened, or a teacup- 
ful of lively yeast, and make into a dough with two quarts of sifted 
flour. Knead it half an hour, put plenty of flour on your board, and 
knead it until it cleaves from the board with a light tearing sound. 
Be careful not to let your dough grow very cold while you work it. 
Divide into loaves, and set to rise in a warm place. Watch the pro- 
cess, and when the loaves are quite light have your oven in good heat 
and bake three quarters of an hour. This bread is very nice if well 
mside, i. e., the potatoes made very fine and kept hot, and perhaps the 
flour warmed also ; but it is not so good when stale as that made with 
a scalded sponge. 

Delicious Biscuit. — Made in the same manner, only adding half a 
pint of sour cream instead of the water. Bring the cream to a scald- 
ing heat, and put in a teaspoonful of soda ; mix otherwise the same. 
Set to rise in the bowl, and, when light, make into small cakes. Put 
them close in the pan, and let them rise upward within an inch of the 
top of the pan and bake. 

Butter]!^ilk Bread. — Put three or four pints of fresh buttermilk 
into a saucepan and boil it. Stir it pretty constantly while it is heat- 
ing, to keep it from separating into whey and curd. Have a quart of 
flour sifted into a suitable vessel, pour the boiling buttermilk on the 
flour, and scald it thoroughly. Stir until all the flour is mixed, and 
set to cool. When sufficiently cool add a teacupf ul of good yeast, and 
let it rise over night ; in the morning sift and mix into the sponge 
enough flour to make a stiff dough ; knead well, and set to rise for 
two hours, then divide into loaves and knead slightly. At this time 
use as little flour as possible. Set to rise again, and bake as soon as 
light enough. Bake in a steady oven three quarters of an hour. This 
is a good sponge for dark, or runny flour. The bread will be white 
and moist. Graham flour, prepared with scalded buttermilk, mixed a 
little stiffer than where sweet milk or water is used, is very sweet and 
good. Do not put soda into the milk or sponge. It will be perfectly 
Bweet when it is baked if the yeast is fresh, and if the whole process 
is carefully attended to in the right time. 

Sweet Potato Buns. — Boil, and then mash three good-sized sweet 
potatoes with a pint of cream or new milk ; mix with as much flour as 
will make a dough as for bread, adding a teacupful of good sponge or 
yeast. Knead well, and set to rise. Always wrap your blanket dose 
aroind the bowl, and place where the wind or cold air does not come, 



RECIPES. 179 

if you wish a quick rising. As soon as the dough begins to crach 
open mould into small rolls and put close together in the baking-pan. 
When sufficiently light bake in a moderate oven half an hour. 

Graham Muffins. — Dissolve a half cake of yeast in a little warm 
water, scald a quart of milk and pour it into two quarts of Graham 
flour, stir well, and let it cool sufficiently, then put in the yeast and a 
spoonful of brown sugar, make a very thick batter, which will heap 
on the spoon ; set to rise over night. In the morning have a good hot 
oven, butter your rings and the pan well with cold butter, fill the 
rings two-thirds full, let them stand a few minutes in a warm place, 
then put into the brisk oven and bake half an hour. 

Bread Muffins. — Take four slices of baker's bread, and cut off the 
crust. Lay them in a pan, and pour boiling water over them, only 
just sufficient to soak them well. Cover the vessel with a cloth, and 
when it has stood an hour draw off the water, and stir the soaked 
bread till the mass is quite smooth, then mix in two tablespoonsful of 
sifted Hour and half a pint of milk, and stir in, gradually, two well- 
beaten eggs. Butter some muffin rings, set them in a buttered bake- 
pan, and fill each two-thirds full. Bake brown, and send to the table

Buckwheat Cakes. — One quart of buckwheat flour and a half a 
pint of Graham meal. Mix with lukewarm water into a batter, stir in 
a teacupful of good yeast sponge or a half cent's worth of baker's 
yeast ; mix in an earthen or stone vessel, and set over night in a warm 
place to rise. If the temperature and yeast have been j ust right, the 
batter will be light and sweet, and not need soda. It should be con- 
sidered a mistake when the ferment needs neutralizing, and cai-e 
taken to set cooler or correct the yeast. 

Buckwheat Gravy. — Buckwheat cakes are often considered rather 
an unwholesome dish ; but we think that the fault comes from the 
excess of melted butter and syrup, which is usually eaten with them. 
Substitute this, at least for the children : — Boil a pint of milk and half 
a pint of cream, put in half a teaspoonful of salt and two or three large 
spoonsful of buckwheat batter, dip a spoonful and put directly into 
the boiling milk, wait for it to boil up, and then add another till you 
get a proper consistency, boil a minute longer, and pour into a tureen 
or pitcher for the table. 

Gravies — May always take the place of butter and syrup when 
griddle cakes are to be eaten, simply by boiling a pint of milk or 
cream and adding a spoonful or two of the batter of which the cakea 
are made as a thickening, a little salt and a very little lump of butter 
may be added. Children are far better satisfied with a creamy gravy 
than with butter. 

Hygienic Breakfast Cakes. — One pint of fresh oatmeal, one quart 
water, let it stand over night. In the morning add one teaspoonful ol 
fine salt, one tablespoonful of sugar, and the same of baking powder, 
and one pint of Graham flour. If the above proportions make a batter 



180 EECIPES. 

too stiff for griddle cakes, add more water. If gems are preferred ia 
stead of cakes, the addition of a little more flour is all that is required 
to produce an extra article. 

Oatmeal Bread. — One quart fresh oatmeal, two quarts of water, 
let stand half a day or over night. When ready to bake, add one 
quart of fine, or Graham flour, half a cup of sugar, one teaspoonful 
fine salt, two teaspoonsful of baking powder ; mix with a spoon. No 
kneading is required. If too stiff, add water. 

Corn Cakes. — Three cups of corn meal, one cup of Graham flour, 
two teaspoonsful of cream yeast powder sifted together, one cup of 
cream, and half a cup of milk, one egg well beaten ; stir altogether 
well and quickly ; heat your gem irons hot ; butter and fill ; bake with 
a brisk heat. Gem tins or forms do not need to be heated before fill- 
ing, they may be oiled and filled on the table, and put into a quick 
oven. 

Graham Griddle Cakes. — Into one pint of Graham flour and half 
pint Indian meal mix thoroughly two teaspoonsful of cream yeast and 
half teaspoonful salt, beat up well one egg and mix with one pint cold 
water, into which mix thoroughly the flour as prepared, and fry at 
once. 

Gold Medal Corn Cakes. — Mix two heaping teaspoonsful of cream 
yeast and half teaspoonful of salt thoroughly through one pint of In- 
dian meal and half pint of sifted flour, beat well one egg and mix in 
one tablespoonf ul of brown sugar, half pint milk or cold water, and 
stir in the meal as prepared, to the consistency of a thick batter, steam 
until half done in a three pint basin, and finish by baking in a hot 
oven, or drop into hot cup or gem pans well buttered, and bake in a 
hot oven. 

Corn Gems. — Mix two heaping teaspoonsful of cream yeast and half 
teaspoonful of salt thoroughly through one and one half pound sifted In- 
dian meal ; stir the meal as prepared slowly into one pint (more or 
less) of sweet milk or cold water, so as to make a very thin batter, 
place in hot gem tins or cups, let them stand five minutes in a warm 
place and bake in a very hot oven. 

Yankee Strawberry Short Cake. — Mix two heaping teaspoonsful 
of cream yeast and half teaspoonful of salt thoroughly through one 
quart of sifted flour, beat well one egg, and mix in two tablespoonsful 
melted butter, one of sugar, nearly a pint of sweet milk or cold water, 
mix in the flour as prepared, as thin as convenient to handle, knead 
but little, let stand five minutes in a warm place, bake in a quick oven ; 
cut into three layers, place sugar and strawberries between and dust 
upper crust with sugar. 

Squash Cakes. — Mix Graham flour with half its bulk of stewed 
squash, or pumpkin, and add milk enough to make a thick batter, 
about a cup of milk to each cup of squash. Put in one teaspoonful 
cream yeast, mixing it well with the flour. Cook on a griddle.

Boston Brown Bread. — Take three pints of Indian meal, sifted 
s,A one quart of rye meal, sifted. Stir into the corn meal one tea- 
spoonful of salt and one teacupful of molasses, and wet it to a batter, 
as thick as that used for griddle cakes, with boiling water ; then set it 
aside to cool. Stir one large cofFeecupful of sour milk, or buttermilk, 
into the rye meal, add to it one teaspoonf ul of soda dissolved in two 
t&blespoonsful of boiling water, and boil on the stove for two minutes, 
or until it is in a light froth. 

Mix together the corn and rye meal batter with the hand, beating it 
well. Let it stand for fifteen minutes, then turn into an iron bake 
kettle, and bake for three or four hours. This will make a large loaf 
of bread, but it is better to bake it all in one pan, as a very thick, hard 
crust forms over the whole, and if one likes, it can be partly removed 
while hot, and eaten with milk or cream, for it makes a very palatable 
dish for breakfast or supper. 

We prefer to bake brown bread, however, by steaming it in a large tin 
pudding dish for three hours, placing the tin in a kettle of boiling 
water, and not letting it boil over the top of it. Then it is put into 
the oven for another hour ; and this way of cooking it will form no 
crust that is not easily eaten, and gives the bread a delicious flavor, 
and it will remain moist for several days. When it is two or three 
days old it is much improved by being warmed in the oven or toasted. 

Apple Bread. — Weigh one pound of fresh, juicy apples, peel, core 
and stew them to a pulp, being careful to use a porcelain kettle or a 
stone jar, placed inside an ordinary saucepan of boiling water ; other- 
wise the fruit will become discolored ; mix the pulp with two pounds 
of the best flour ; put in the same quantity of yeast you would use for 
common bread, and as much water as will make it a fine, smooth 
dough ; put into an iron pan and place it into a warm place to rise, and 
let it remain for twelve hours, at least. Form it into rather long-shaped 
loaves, and bake in a quick oven. 

Fruit Corn Cakes. — Put a pint of whortleberries in a bowl, add a 
teacupful of sugar, one pint of corn meal and a large tablespoonful of 
fine flour, wet with boiling water. Bake in cakes about one-half an 
inch thick on a griddle or in an oven twenty minutes. For nice apple 
cakes use sweet and tart apples, chopped, instead of berries. 

Oat Meal or Scotch Puffs. — One quart of sweet milk, three well 
beaten eggs, two and a half cups of oat meal, one and a half cups of 
Graham flour, and a little salt. Use a medium-sized cup. Heat and 
oil the gem irons and bake in a quick oven. 

Graham Flour Puffs. — One quart of sweet milk, two eggs, flour 
to make a thin batter, fill the gem cups two- thirds full, bake in a quick 
oven. 

Rice Griddle Cakes. — Cook half a teacupful of whole rice till every 
grain is dissolved and like jelly. Warm half a pint of rich milk, 
put in half a teaspoonful of salt, stir the rice into the milk till it 
Is smoothly mixed. Bent three eggs, whites and yolks separately, 
till very light, and put into the rice and milk the last thing. Bake 
jn a hot greased griddle till brown and light.

Indian Griddles. — Two cups of meal, one of flour, one of milk • 
one of water, one egg well beaten, two teaspoonsful of cream yeast 
sifted into the meal and flour. Mix and bake on hot griddles, 

Graham Gems. — You are supposed to have the baking irons oi 
'* setting " for these gems ; else we don't know what you will do. 
They are to be had of hardware dealers ; at least no kitchen is fur- 
nished without them. These gems are displacing all other kinds of 
coarse bread on our table. They can be eaten with butter or without 
butter, hot or cold, morning, noon, and night. They are as handy as 
crackers ; are just what you want for children's lunch, and to fill in 
when you are making up a picnic basket. They are not only hygienic, 
but are good in the mouth. They have an almond-like sweetness, 
and their fibre is like that of nut-meats, giving the teeth just the ex- 
ercise they crave. No taste of " emptyings." But to our receipt, 
which will not be half as long as this preamble. Put the irons in the 
oven, where they will get hot by the time you have mixed the gems. 
Then take milk and water, half and half, and stir in Graham flour. 
No. 1, till you have a batter that will " drop from the spoon and not 
run." Stir very thoroughly, the more the better. Drop into the hot 
irons and bake immediately. (If you are quick you can take the irons 
out of the oven for better convenience in filling.) The oven is a grand 
point. It should have a solid heat, and bake as fast as it can and not 
burn. "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again." Make the bat- 
ter a little thicker or thinner, the oven a little slower or quicker 
(quicker more likely). There is a way, and you will find it, and then 
be able to repeat your success as often as you wish. 

Wheat Meal Unleavened Cakes (Gems). — To one quart of soft, 
cold water, add, by degrees, three pints of coarsely ground wheat 
meal. Stir rapidly, with a large spoon, three or four minutes, so as to 
incorporate a large amount of atmosphere. Dip out into iron baking 
molds, which have been heated hot and oiled. Bake immediately in 
an oven as hot as it can be and not burn, for twenty or twenty-five 
minutes. Diminish the heat after fifteen minutes. Iron molds are 
better than tin. The small size, about three inches in length, and one 
and a half in width, is better than the larger sizes. The proportions 
of water and meal in this formula are for white wheat. For red wheat 
a little more meal is necessary. One-sixth corn meal is an improve- 
ment, in which case it needs a heaping measure of meal to the water. 

Oat Meal and Graham Gems. — Mix equal parts of fine Irish oat 
meal and Graham flour into a thick batter with milk and water equal 
parts, fill hot gem irons and bake with a brisk heat. Very sweet and 
tender. 

Wheat Meal Rolls. — Pour boiling water on unbolted wheat 
meal, stirring rapidly with a strong spoon or stick. The dough 
ehould be scarcely stiff enough to retain its shape. Of this take por- 
tions about the size of a hen's egg, and roll it into a round form three 
or four inches in length ; a plenty of dry flour to prevent sticking. 
Bake at onc«. The coating of flour also prevents the escape of a%r 



RECIPES. 183 

from the dough, as the sudden heat of baking expands it, thus making 
the rolls much lighter. Let bake in a very hot oven. 

Snow Cakes or Bread. — First cool a wooden bowl, in this put 
the desired quantity of corn or unbolted wheat meal, mix with this 
twice or three times as much snow. It now appears like dry meal. 
Put some on a hot griddle ; if too dry to turn well add more snow ; if 
too wet to be light add more meal ; when just Hght bake the same as 
batter cakes, or put it in a pan, about two inches deep — rounding it 
from the edge — and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. 

Corn Cakes. — Pour hot water on to corn meal to make a stiff bat- 
ter ; let it stand over night. In the morning add milk to thin it, then 
stir in Graham flour, in which is a little baking powder, until it is the 
right consistence for baking. Bake in gem pans, and they will be 
light and nice, with a very small proportion of yeast powder. 

Corn Meal Breakfast Cake. — For two baking tins take one and 
a half pints of coarsely ground corn meal. Add water nearly boiling, 
but not enough to wet quite all of the corn meal ; add cold water, a 
little at a time, stirring thoroughly between whiles, until you have it 
BO thin that it has a tendency to settle as you pour it into your pie 
tins. It should not be more than half an inch deep in the tins, and it 
should bake quickly in a hot oven. 

Corn Cake, with Fruit. — Pour one quart boiling water on one 
quart corn meal, and stir quickly. Wet the hands, and form the 
dough into small round cakes one-half an incli thick. Bake in a hot 
oven. The addition of a few raspberries, huckleberries, or any other 
sub-acid fruit, is a decided improvement. Sweet apples, chopped 
fine, are also excellent. 

Corn and Rye Biscuits. — Pour boiling water on coarse yellow 
corn meal, and stir to the consistency of a thick batter. Immediately 
add coarse rye meal to make into a very soft dough ; form into small, 
flat biscuits (fifteen to a baking pan) with the hands frequently wet in 
cold water, and bake immediately in a hot oven. They are very nice 
for variety, and are best made of equal parts of corn and rye. Bake 
thirty minutes or more. 

Wheat Meal Crisps. — Wet unbolted wheat meal with boiling 
water, and form a stiff dough. Grease, or sprinkle flour on a nice 
sheet of iron — the bottom of a smooth sheet-iron pan would answer — 
on this roll out the dough as thin as possible, mark into convenient 
squares, and bake in a slow oven. When rightly baked they will not 
curl or blister. Invalids with the poorest leeth, whose state of health 
may require dry food, can eat them. 

Wheat Meal Biscuits. — Pour boiling soft water upon coarse 
white-wheat meal, stir with a spoon to a dough as soft as it can be 
managed, by the exercise of skill, upon a molding board. Roll to an 
inch in thickness, cut with a bisc^iit cutter, prick and bake immedi- 
ately in an oven hotter than is necessary for the two preceding. It 



184 BECIPES. 

will take half an hour to bake. If made of red wheat it must bo 
Btiffer and baited longer. 

Good Unleavened Bread. — Take half the flour you intend using, 
and pour on boiling milk (be sure it boils) ; have it about the consist- 
ency of batter that you would have for making pancakes ; let thia 
stand till cool enough to work ; then knead in the rest of your flour, 
just sufficiently stiff to mold on a board. One hour in a middling hot 
oven is sufficient for baking. 

Dr. Jenkins's Graham Crackers.— Procure the whitest and 
cleanest wheat (Canada wheat is best), have the crackers made by a 
baker. Mix with nothing but pure, soft water, and thoroughly re- 
duce the mass in a baker's break, as for making other crackers. Have 
them rolled very thin, no more than half as thick as soda crackers, cut 
in the form and the size of soda crackers, and bake quickly until a pale 
yellow. These will keep six months if placed in a dry, cool, sweet 
store room. They are fresher and more tender to place them iu u. hot 
even a few moments before bringing them to the table. 

Graham Crackers. — Wet the best of Graham flour with cold 
milk, adding about a fifth proportion of thick cream, or a little butter 
if cream is not to be had. Mix as soft as can be handled ; knead very 
thoroughly, say fifteen or twenty minutes ; roll thin ; cut iri three- 
inch-square cards ; lay, so they will not touch each other, on a hot 
sheet-iron pan, and bake quickly, say ten to fifteen or twenty minutes, 
according to thickness. Handle carefully while hot, and pack away, 
when cold, in tin cans or stone jars in a cool, dry place. 

Apple-Corn Pone. — Pare and chop fine a quart of sweet apples. 
Scald a quart of corn meal with a pint of boiling water ; add new 
milk enough to make a stiff batter, then stir in the apples. Bake 
slowly in a close vessel three hours. Butter the dish well. This is 
very nice, boiled the same length of time in a pudding-mold or bag. 
But it is never so good as when baked in an old-fashioned kettle with 
a close-fitting lid, with live coals from the fire heaped on top and 
under the kettle. The thick brown crusts are delicious, with cream or 
milk. 

Steamed Brown Bread. — One quart of rye meal, one pint of Indian 
meal, one cup of molasses, one teaspoonf ul of sifted cream yeast stirred 
in the molasses, a little salt. Stir soft with cold water, steam three 
hours, and dry off in the overi fifteen minutes. 

Brown Bread. — The sweetest bread ever made. — Take three 
pints of coarse yellow corn meal, scald it with three pints and a half 
of boiling water, add two pints of coarse rye meal after the corn hag 
cooled. Knead thoroughly with the hands, Take it out into a stone- 
ware crock, or pot, which is a little larger at the top. The quantity here 
given will take a vessel which holds five or six quarts. Place it imme- 
diately in the oven after smoothing over the top with a spoon fre- 
quently dipped in cold water. Cover with a stone or iron plate, and 
have but little heat in the oven. It should take three hours to begin 
to bake, then bake slowly four hours. Leave the loaf in until th« 



EECIPE8. 185 

oven cools off, if it is several hours longer. It should be dark-«olored, 
light and firm, with a good soft crust. A round-bottomed iron kettle 
wlQ do to bake in. Try it. 

Yajstkee Brown Bread. — Take equal quantities of rye and corn 
meal, and mix with water, making a dough that can be kneaded. 
Work with the hands until it loses its stickiness, and will readily 
cleave from the fingers. Let it stand several hours, or over night, and 
bake in loaves, in covered dishes, in a moderate oven, from three to 
five hours. Or, it may be steamed three hours, and baked one. 
Coarsely ground meal is better than fine for this kind of bread. 

Apple Brown Bread. — Work equal parts of corn and rye meal 
into stewed apples until the entire mass is thoroughly mixed, and bake 
as above. Or, thin with water to a batter, and bake on the griddle. 

How TO Make Oat Meal Cakes. — The Rural Cyclopedia, pub- 
lished at Edinburgh, Scotland, gives the following receipt for making 
oat meal cakes. Well made they are delicious. 

" As much meal as will make a sheet 24 or 30 inches in diameter 
and one-eighth of an inch in thickness, is put into a wooden basin, 
with a suliiciency of water for working the meal into a light paste. 
The meal and water are mixed by tne fingers of the right hand, 
while the basin is turned constantly round by the left hand, till the 
paste is made ; the paste is then turned out on a clean board, or 
table, and alternately kneaded with the knuckles of both hands, 
sprinkled with meal, gathered up, kneaded and sprinkled, and 
kneaded again and again, till it becomes a well kneaded and homo- 
geneous dough ; the dough is then flattened out with the knuckles 
into a circular cake of half an inch, or less, in thickness, and imme- 
diately afterward distended with a roller into a sheet of about one- 
eighth of an inch in thickness ; and the sheet is then pared round the 
edges and cut into three or four parts from the centre with a knife. 
The parts of the cut sheet of dough are fired, or half baked, first on 
the one side and then on the other, upon a thin circular plate of iron, 
called a griddle or girdle; and then they are toasted, or whole 
baked, by being placed on their edge on a toaster close before the 
fire, with first the one side and then the other exposed to the heat. 
Some butter is sometimes mixed with the paste, to render the cakes 
* fresh ' and highly relishable, and occasionally a few caraway seeds 
also are added, but in the estimation of racy, unsophisticated cake- 
eaters, all such admixtures are an abomination." 

A Scotchman writing to the New York Observer in reference to these 
cakes and oat meal generally, says : 

"The favorite accompaniment to this is sweet milk, dipped with 
the spoon (which has previously taken up and contains a portion ol 
thjo porridge) out of a separate dish from the porridge." 

Oat Meal Breakfast Cakes. — This is made of No. 2 oat meal, 
with water enough to saturate it, and little or no salt. Pour it into 
a baking tin half an inch or three-quarters deep, shake it down level, 
and when this is done it should be so wet that two or three spoonsful 
of watei should run freely on the surface. Put it in a quick over

and bake twenty minutes. Eat warm. It will be as light and tendei 
as the best " Johnny cake," or else you have wet it too much oi 
baked it too long. This is one of the most accommodating baked 
dishes that can be made. It will do very nicely with a little longei 
time if the oven is not quite hot. If it will not bake there at all, 
pour it into a frying pan, cover it close and set it on the top of tha 
stove, where it will even bake in fifteen minutes. 

For a hurried breakfast and a slow coal fire it is invaluable. Scarcely 
any wholesome thing in the whole bread line can be prepared more 
readily. It can be made still thinner and baked quicker. It is good 
either crisp or moist. For emergencies alone every housekeeper will 
find it convenient to be able to make the breakfast cake. Many use 
oat meal mixed with buckwheat, wheat or corn, for griddle cakes. 
For this use I prefer it cooked first. Take, say one-half pint of the 
porridge or the mush, diffuse it in one quart of water, and add the 
wheat meal, sifting it in and stirring slowly. 

Oat Meal Cake. — Take one pint of oatmeal, and just warm watei 
enough to stir up a batter like griddle cakes. Pour it into a shallow 
baking pan, and bake for twenty minutes in a hot oven. Or, if pref- 
erable, bake it in small cakes on the griddle, first putting in a hand- 
ful of wheat flour and a little more water. The cold porridge will 
also make delicious griddle cakes. 

Cream Toast. — Boil a pint and a half of cream or new milk and 
thicken with a tablespoonf ul of flour or corn starch, add a little salt. 
Toast slices of stale bread quickly, of an even brown on both sides, 
lay them in the toast dish and dip over them a plentiful supply of 
the hot thickened cream ; add another layer of toast and then more 
cream. 

Another Way. — Cut smooth slices of stale bread less than half an 
inch thick, toast a delicate brown, put the plate into the oven and 
heat it quite warm, lay the toast into the plate and pour over it cold, 
sweet cream, and the toast is ready to be eaten. For invalids and 
children with dainty appetites, this is very nice and easily digested. 
Some light fruit jelly will add to the relish and still be wholesome. 

Norwegian Oat Meal Porridge. — Take two or three handfuls 
of meal, mixed, coarse and fine, in proportion of one-third latter to two 
of the former. Mix in a basin of cold water and pour into a pan con- 
taining about a quart of boiling water, adding a small portion of salt. 
Set on the fire, and keep stirring, adding from time to time small 
doses of meal until it boils and has acquired a proper consistency ; 
which may be known by its glutinous state, as it drops from the 
spoon. Let it simmer ten minutes, then pour into common dinner 
plates. Spoon out portions and float in new milk, adding sugar to 
taste. 

Oat Meal Cracknels. — Take the finest quality of oatmeal, and 
Btir in barley water enough to wet it through ; let it stand twenty 
minutes to swell then roll it out to a quarter of an inch in thickness, 
first flouring the board and rolling pin with wheat flour. Cut it with 
a biscuit cutter and bake in a moderately hot oven, as these cakes 



BEcrPES, 187 

will bum quickly, and only require to be of the slightest brown. 
They will snap easily between the fingers, and are delicious, requir- 
ing no butter to make them palatable. If put into a close jar they 
will keep for several months. In the Highlands of Scotland they 
preserve their cracknels, or bannocks, as they call them, in the barrels 
of oatmeal for a year or so. 

Another way to' make cracknels, is to mix oatmeal to a stifE batter 
with cold water, and let it stand several hours. Or mix with sweet 
milk and let it stand until it swells (do not let it sour), then pour it 
into bake pans and bake twenty minutes. They should be one- 
fourth of an inch thick and a light brown color when done. 

Oat Meal and Cocoanut Cracknels. — Oatmeal mixed with 
grated cocoanut produces a very attractive cake to both old and 
young. Take three heaping tablespoonfuls of grated cocoanut, or 
two of the prepared "dessicated " cocoanut; add to it half a pint 
of the finest oatmeal and two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar; stir 
it into one gill of boiling water, and mix it thoroughly together ; 
turn out on the rolling board, well floured, and roll it as thin and 
cut out as for common cracknels, put a bit of citron and half a dozen 
currants into each cake, sticking them into the dough. Bake in a 
slow oven and watch carefully lest they brown a shade too deep. 
To make them crispy let them stand a day in an uncovered dish. A 
very palatable pie crust can be made from the dough of oatmeal 
cracknels by wetting it a little thinner ; or in preparing it, add just 
half the measure of meal in hot water. Add no butter or lard, sim- 
ply a little salt ; roll out thin, and make the pie of cooked fruits, as 
this kind of paste bakes very quickly, and if the fruit requires cook- 
ing it would become too hard and brown. Most persons who eschew 
all kinds of pies can eat those made of oatmeal without fear or 
trembling, and they will soon learn to consider oatmeal an invalu- 
able addition to their tables. 

Onion Toast. — Boil some onions of moderate size ; change the 
water twice in boiling ; salt in the last water. When nicely done take 
out with a skimmer. Make a gravy such as you make for cream toast 
Toast slices of bread, lay them in a dish, put the onions on the slices, 
one on a slice, and pour the gravy over both. 

Note. — The onions will cook in half the time if you cut them into three or four 
■lices before you put them into the water. 

Egg Toast. — Break the eggs carefully into water boiling hot, but 
not really boiling. Let them simmer till they are delicately cooked or 
till the yolks are covered with a white film, then take up with a skim- 
mer and lay on slices of buttered or cream toast. Salt the water in 
which the eggs are boiled, and see that it covers the eggs. Butter and 
pepper may be added on the table. 

TO COOK EGGS. 

Boiled Eggs. — Boil three minutes by the watch, and you have th« 
central or yellow part soft boiled, while the white is hard, unpalatable 
and diflficult of digestion. 



^ 88 BKCIPES. 

Place the eggs in water ** milkwarm," or a little wamiei. In foiLl 
or five minutes pour off the water, and immediately pour on boiling 
water to cover the eggs, and in five minutes they will be cooked. 

If boiling water is poured on cold eggs in a cold dish, it will be so 
suddenly cooled that the eggs will not be cooked, but treat them as 
above directed, and you will find them thoroughly cooked, yet soft 
and palatable. 

The Queen's Omelet. — Place in the frying pan about one ounce 
of butter. Break three eggs, separately, to see they are fresh ; beat 
them up with a little chopped parsley and a pinch of pepper and salt. 
The eggs should not be beaten too much, or the white of them sepa- 
rates, and you produce a watery mixture which destroys the flavor and 
appearance of the omelet. Now the butter is melted, pour in the fry- 
ing pan the omelet mixture and stir till it begins to set or thicken, 
shake the pan occasionally, and fold over the omelet neatly into an 
oval shape, and when it is of a golden color turn quickly into a dish. 
To be able to prepare a plain omelet is to be able to prepare every 
kind of omelet. If you require a cheese omelet, introduce into the 
omelet mixture about a dessert spoonful of grated cheese, with a little 
pepper and salt, and sometimes a few grains of cayenne pepper. In a 
sweet omelet no pepper or salt, but a little grated sugar ; and just be- 
fore the omelet is folded in the pan distribute evenly over a little jam 
In preparing an omelet, remember five things— a clean pan ; the mix- 
ture must not be too much beaten ; the omelet must not be too 
large ; three eggs are better than six eggs, which make two omelets ; 
they should not be too much cooked ; they should be eaten immedi- 
ately, or they become tough, and more like a pancake. 

Dkopped Eggs. — Have ready a saucepan of boiling water. Drop 
fresh eggs carefully into the water so as not to break the yolks. Let 
them stand where they will keep hot,, but not boil, until the white 
sets. Toast slices of bread and lay in a dish, and pour over it a gill 
of hot cream with a little salt ; then take out the eggs with an egg- 
slice or tablespoon, and put on to the bread with parsley, if you 
like. 

Baked Omelet. — Boil half a pint of cream, or rich milk ; beat 
six eggs thoroughly — they will be nicer if the whites and yolks are 
beaten separately ; have a deep dish hot and buttered ; stir the beaten 
eggs, with a little salt, into the cream ; put all quickly into the dish, 
and bake from five to ten minutes, depending upon the condition of 
the oven. It should be lightly browned, and taken directly to the 
table in the dish. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Have a spider hot and buttered. Break as 
many eggs as you wish to cook into a dish, being careful not to break 
the yolks. Slip the eggs into the spider, sprinkle over a very little 
salt, and add a lump of butter the size of a nutmeg for half a dozen 
eggs, or three tablespoonf uls of rich cream. When the eggs begin to ' 
whiten, stir them carefully from the bottom, until cooked to suit. The 
yolks and whites should separate, though stirred together. Care 
should be taken not to have the spider too hot. 



BKCIPES. 189 

Bakrd Egos. — Take a common white dish with a smooth bottom, 
and large enough to hold the eggs you wish to cook ; do not crowd 
them. Set the dish into the oven till quite hot, then butter it ; have 
the eggs broken, and slip them carefully into the dish ; sprinkle a 
little salt over them, and put directly into a quick oven and bake 
three or five minutes. Butter and pepper may be added, if desired, 
when they are cooked. A tablespoonful of cream to two eggs, when 
they are first set to bake, is nice. 

PREPARATIONS OF CHEESE. 

Cheese and Bread Toast. — Grate half a cup of good cheese — 
use your crumbs and dry pieces — mix with it one cup of grated bread 
and the yolk of one egg, half a spoonful of butter, and three spoonfuls 
of rich cream. Add a salt spoonful of salt, and a sprinkle of cayenne 
and mustard if desired. Toast two or three slices of bread, spread the 
cheese mixture on quite thick, put into the oven a minute or two, and 
send to the table hot. Or lay on a top slice, and make a sandwich. 
Take a sharp knife and cut into four pieces. 

Cottage Cheese. — This is a farmer's dish, but should and would 
be eaten and appreciated by all classes if they knew how wholesome 
and digestible it is. Those who have plenty of milk and make butter, 
have an abundance of sour or clabbered milk daily, clean and fresh. 
Skim the cream off for the churn, and set a gallon or two of the milk 
on the stove in a milk pan, and let it gradually warm till it is luke- 
warm all through . Stir it occasionally to prevent its hardening at the 
bottom, and when it is a little warmer than new milk, and the whey 
begins to show clear around the curd, pour it all into a coarse thin 
bag, tie close, and hang up to strain. Let it hang two or three hours 
in a cool, shady place, then take from the bag and put in a covered 
dish. When preparing the rest of a meal, mix with the curd rich 
sweet cream, sugar, and nutmeg. Some prefer salt and pepper, but 
the sugar gives it the place of fruits or acids. This preparation of 
milk will often be found most salutary and wholesome for dyspeptics 
and weak inflamed stomachs. The clabber is also very nutritious and 
easily digested. 

SANDWICHES. 

Sandwiches are very useful to put in your bag or your pocket 
when you are not likely to be able to procure your usual meal. 

Cheese Sandwiches. — Take two-thirds of good cheese, grated, 
and one-third of butter ; add a little cream ; pound all together m 
a mortar ; then spread it on slices of brown bread or gems ; lay 
another slice over each ; press them gently together, and cut in smrll 
square pieces. 

Egg Saft^wiches. — Boil fresh eggs five minutes ; put them la 
cold water, and when quite cold peel them, and after taking a litOl^ 
of the white off each end of the eggs, cut the remainder in four slicea 
Lay them between bread and butter.

190 RECIPES. 

Fried Egg Sandwiches. — Beat some eggs well ; fry them in bu t 
ter as a pancake. When cold, cut in smaU square pieces, and lay 
them between brown bread and butter. 

Omelet Sandwiches. — Take four eggs, two tablespoonfuls of 
bread crumbs, and one half ounce of chopped parsley. After beating 
ihe eggs well, add the bread crumbs, then the parsley, and two table- 
spoonfuls of water. Season, and fry it in small fritters, and when 
cold put them betweea brown bread and butter. 

VEGETABLES. 

All green vegetables should be as fresh as possible. Put them into 
cold water with some salt in it, for about ten minutes, to clear from 
soil or insects. If not quite fresh, let them remain in the water some 
time longer ; drain in a colander, and put them into a pan with plenty 
of boiling water, adding salt, and a small piece of soda ; cover the pan 
till boiling, but not afterward ; then boil quickly, and carefully remove 
any scum which may rise. Do not allow them to remain in the water 
after they are done, but immediately drain them in a colander, and 
finish each kind, as directed in recipes. Peas and spinach do not re- 
quire so much water as most other green -ssegetables, but only just suf- 
ficient to cover them. Cauliflowers and brocoli require especial care in 
boiling, as the flower is easily broken and their appearance spoiled; 
boil them quickly for a few minutes, and then moderately till tender, 
which may be easily ascertained by trying the stem with a fork. All 
vessels used in cooking vegetables should be particularly clean. Soft 
is preferable to hard water in cooking all kinds of vegetables. Pota- 
toes are in universal use, and yet how few know how to cook them 
well ! " A well-boiled potato is a thing purely ideal — it has never 
come out of the poj, in the experience of living man." This is too 
strong; but there is very much room for, and need of, improvement in 
the science of cooking a potato. To do it well, the matter must be studied, 
and not performed by routine. They differ very much, even those 
grown in the same field and from the same seed. A good potato, well 
cooked and served up, is a luxury, which, unfortunately, few people 
know how to accomplish, or will not give themselves the trouble to do. 

Potatoes. — Those grown on virgin soil, of a middle size, and 
floury, are to be preferred. They should be as nearly as possible of 
one size, well washed, but not pared. They should be put into a ves- 
sel of cold water for an hour, then put into fresh water, and boiled in 
a kettle or saucepan, closely covered, in the most expeditious manner 
possible ; or they should be steamed, which would be still better. If 
boiled, no more water should be used than merely to cover them, as 
they produce a considerable quantity of fluid. When they are done, 
the water should be instantly poured off, and the kettle containing the 
cooked potatoes be placed on the side of the fire with a cover on, and 
* cloth over them, until the steam is absorbed, and rendered quite dry 
and mealy before they are sent to the table. 

Baked Potatoes. — Have a hot baking oven, select and wash pota- 
toes of uniform size, and put them moist into a clean oven. Do no^ 



BECIPES. 191 

op<m the oven if you can avoid it for half an hour ; try if they are done 
in a towel. Eat them hot. 

Potato Balls. — (For Breakfast). — Boil and mash a douhle quan- 
tity of potatoes for dinner, season with sweet cream and a little salt : 
work in two fresh eggs to a quart. Mold into little balls, prick the 
tops, and lay away in the cold on a plate. In the morning put on bak- 
ing pan and set into the oven until done to a delicate brown, which re 
quires fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Potatoes are a standard article of food on most tables, but they 
are often so badly cooked that they are neither palatable nor whole- 
some. As a breakfast dish they are excellent. We like them pre- 
pared thus : Select the smaller ones — leaving the larger ones for din- 
ner — scrape off the skins of new potatoes, put them into cold water 
for ten minutes, have water boiling, and cook them twenty minutes ; 
pour ofE the water and add a cup of milk or cream, and thicken it witlx 
a little flour and butter rubbed together. Butter never floats on the 
surface when mixed with flour thus, nor does the flour trouble you 
with lumps. It is just as well, however, to leave out the butter, mix- 
ing the flour with a little cream. 

Potatoes should always be put into bailing water to cook, boil 
quickly and pour off the water, letting them dry a few ininutes over 
the fire before dishing up; Steaming is the best manner of cooking 
them. 

Mashed Potatoes should be left in the kettle after draining and 
drying as above, and mashed thoroughly over the fire ; add a little 
milk or cream, and they will be light as a sponge and white as flour. 
Never put butter into them. 

Steam Squash. — Squash cooked in a steamer over a little water 
Is much nicer than when boiled. I never boil squash. It may be cut 
In large pieces and cooked in a kettle with a small steamer in the bot- 
tom and half a pint of water; fill the kettle with squash and keep 
closely covered till well cooked, taking care not to let it burn. A very 
hot fire is not so good for cooking as a slow, moderate heat. May be 
placed on the table warm or cold, mashed or not, as preferred. 

Many kinds of squash, especially late and winter squashes, are 
better baked than any other way — they are quite equal to sweet pota- 
toes when baked in a close kettle so as to partly steam them. Cut in 
slices three quarters of an inch thick. 

Raw Tomatoes. — The simplest and one of the most wholesome 
modes of preparing tomatoes is to remove the skins by scalding, cut 
them in slices and season to the taste. To our taste powdered loaf 
sugar makes the best seasoning. The tomatoes should be solid, like 
the Trophy, and perfectly ripe. As a substitute for fruit, they an- 
Bwer a good purpose, especially the yellow and white varietiea 

Stewed Tomatoes. — Let the tomatoes be well ripened, scald them 
and remove the skins, cut into small pieces, put into a saucepan, with 
a little salt and butter, and cook till well done, but no longer. Peppei 
may be added if agreeable. Aa a substitute for fruit, omit the pep*

per and sweet(3n to the taste with white sugar. In thia case Dixie an-5 
White Apple tomatoes are best, as the j have a decidedly f ruitj flavor. 

Bboiled Tomatoes. — First raise your tomato. If not quite ripe, 
no matter ; cut in two flat-wise ; put it skin down, on a hot iron and in 
a few minutes (seasoned to your taste) you have a dish that is pretty, 
wholesome and delicious — tomatoes on the half shell. 

We have tried it. Those who have not, do not yet know how ex- 
quisite a morsel the tomato is capable of being made. With a little 
pepper and salt, or, better still, with butter and sugar, broiled toma- 
toes furnish a dish fit for the gods. 

Note. — This manner of preparing tomatoes is indeed excellent. We toast slices 
of bread nice and brown, butter them a little, and lay on to them the broiled 
tomatoes ; put half a teacupful of cream into the dish around the toast, and set it 
into the oven a few minutes* before takinor to the table. 



-"o 



Tomatoes should be sliced and boiled in their own juice without 
water. They should boil briskly. Twenty minutes suffices for a 
quart. If boiled much longer it injures their peculiar flavor. Sea- 
son when ready to take up. 

Baked Tomatoes. — One quart of fresh round tomatoes. Scald 
and peel carefully, so as not to break the tomato ; put into a deep dish, 
and season with a little salt and cayenne. Roll a teacupful of crackers 
and spread over the top ; cover lightly, and bake in a quick oven half 
or three quarters of an hour. Two or three lumps of butter, the size 
of a Lima bean, may be dropped into the dish just before dishing up. 
Slip them out carefully, the brown side up, or leave them in the bak- 
ing dish. 

Scalloped Tomatoes. — Peel as many large ripe tomatoes as you 
cvish to prepare ; cut them into slices a quarter of an inch thick. Pack 
m a pudding dish first a layer of tomatoes, then a thick layer of bread 
crumbs, salt, and a little white sugar and butter, then a layer of to- 
matoes, then bread crumbs, etc., till the dish is nearly full, having 
tomatoes last. Now dust over pepper, a little sugar and butter, strew 
the top with bread crumbs, and bake {covered) half an hour ; then re- 
move the cover and bake brown, but be careful not to scorch. 

Corn Oysters. — One quart of grated corn, three eggs well beaten, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, with flour enough to make them stick to- 
gether. Drop from a spoon into a hot buttered frying pan, making 
cakes the size of an oyster. A cup of sour milk, with half a teaspoon- 
ful of soda, will answer if eggs are not plenty. 

Green Corn on the Cob. — Remove the husks and silk from full- 
grown ears of corn in which the milk is well developed. Put them 
into sufficient boiling water to cover. Boil gently in a covered kettle 
from twenty to thirty minutes, according to the age of the corn. It ia 
better cooked by steam for half an hour. Corn which requires more 
than half an hour to cook is not good. 

Corn when Cut from the Cob. — Split the kernels of corn before 
removing from the cob, and in cutting off cut them several times 
through, leaving a large part on the cob to be scraped off, so as to 



BECIFKS. 193 

mako a fine mass of the whole. Take a pint of milk or cream, bring 
it to a boil, and put tlie corn in and boil slowlv in a closed porcelain 
or tin vessel for fifteen or twenty minutes with a very little salt ; or, 
which is better, steam it for half an hour. It will then be very rich 
and savory. 

Succotash. — For succotash, Lima beans are the best ; the Agricul- 
tural stand second on the list. But any good variety of bush beans, 
which come earlier than these, makes an article by no means inferior. 
Shell the green beans, and boil them slowly in an abundance of water 
for one or two hours, being careful to keep them covered with water 
while boiling. Cut well-grown corn from the cob, as in the previous 
directions ; place it in a pan or basin to steam, over the beans — if not 
provided with suitable steam apparatus. Add a little water to the 
corn, and stir it occasionally. Steam from twenty to thirty minutes, 
then add the corn to the beans, and simmer for half an hour. Stir 
often, and watch carefully that it does not burn. Season to suit the 
taste. 

Dried Sweet Corn. — Wash the quantity you wish to cook. Add 
two or three times as much water, and soak over night. In the morn- 
ing place on the range or stove in a closed tin or porcelain vessel, 
where it will keep at the scalding point for four or five hours. Do 
not let it boil a moment. Be equally careful to keep it hot. Add 
water, if necessary, but do not make it too thick. Season as you like 
with salt. 

Winter Succotash. — Take equal quantities of dried sweet corn 
and of dried green beans. Wash and soak them separately, over 
night, in warm water. Add more water, if necessary, in the morning. 
Boil the beans slowly for four or five hours, adding boiling water oc- 
casionally. Cook the corn as you would without the beans. Then 
add the corn to the beans, and cook slowly, only long enough to com- 
bine them well. This is an excellent article of food, if carefully pre- 
pared, although not equal to succotash in the summer. Season with 
cream and salt. 

To Bake Beans. — Prepare them as for stewing, and place them 
with a large quantity of water in a stone-ware pot in a hot oven. Let 
the oven cool somewhat after they begin to cook, and bake them from 
four to six hours rather slowly. Leave out meat and butter, and trim 
with cream and salt. 

Dried Green Peas. — Wash the peas, pour boiling soft water over 
them, sufficient to cover. Let them stand over night. Stew them for 
several hours, or until they are soft and pulpy. Add boiling water 
occasionally, and keep them covered closely while cooking. Add half 
a cup of cream and a little salt, and boil ten minutes ; then dish up. 

Stewed Carrots. — One pound and a half of carrots ; one ounce of 
butter ; quarter of an ounce of parsley ; one teaspoonf ul of flour, and 
four tablespoonf uls of cream. About half-boil the carrots, then scrape 
and slice them ; put them into a pan with half a teacupful of vege 
table broth, or water ; let them simmer tiP ^uite tender, but not 



194 BECIPE8. 

brokeu ; add the chopped parsley, and stir in the flour and buttei 
previously mixed; simmer them ten minutes longer, and serve ini' 
mediately. 

Green Peas. — The most important part is to get the peas fresh 
from the vines. They lose their delicious flavor in a very short time 
after picking. Wash before shelling, not after. Shell the peas, then 
select the tenderest pods, and put into just water enough to cover 
them, and after boiling them ten or fifteen minutes, skim out the 
pods and put in the peas. Boil them slowly twenty minutes, trim 
with a little rich cream, and salt. They should be boiled in so little 
water that there will not be more than a half teacupf ul around them 
when they are cooked, and this should be seasoned and dished with 
the peas. Those who must depend upon the markets for peas often 
find them very insipid and tasteless, notwithstanding their care in 
selecting and cooking. Sometimes a spoonful of sugar will add to 
the flavor. Boiling the pods adds much to the richness and sweetness 
of the peas. 

Asparagus. — Select green asparagus. If you have the privilege 
of cutting it from the bed, break or cut as close to the ground as it is 
tender. If you must buy from the markets, try several stalks and see 
that they are not woody and tough. The white ends are usually so, 
and are not eatable, being very bitter besides. After breaking olf the 
hardest part, the asparagus may be improved by taking a thin sharp 
knife and stripping off the outside skin, beginning at the cut end and 
drawing the skin upward as far as it will go. The bitter lies next to 
the outside. Now cut the stalks into pieces an inch long, put into a 
saucepan, sprinkle over a little salt, and just cover with boiling 
water. Cook twenty minutes ; add half a teacupf ul of sweet cream ; 
rub together a teaspoonf ul of butter and a teaspoonf ul of flour and 
stir in ; boil up a minute or two ; toast a thin slice of bread a light 
brown; cut into several pieces; lay into the bottom of a dish, and 
pour the asparagus over. Or leave the asparagus without cutting up, 
lay it all one way in the saucepan, and otherwise prepare the same. 

Shelled Beans. — Of the shelling beans the Lima, Horticulturax, 
and Saba are the best. They require a full hour to boil, and a large 
quantity of water, as there appears to be a more rapid evaporation 
when beans are boiling than with most vegetables. When ready to 
dish, season as other vegetables. Much seasoning destroys or covers 
up the delicious taste of the bean. A little rich cream and salt is 
sufficient. 

String Beans should be strung, broken in pieces, and boiled an 
hour or two, and seasoned the same as shelled beans. 

Boiled Cabbage. — Take off the outside leaves — all that are green 
or imperfect — from a head of white cabbage; cut into quarters, and 
lay it for a few minutes into a panful of cold salted water. This will 
at once remove slugs or insects. Open the leaves, but do not break 
them from the stem. Shake them in the water and examine carefully, 
then put into a kettle containing at least three quarts of fast boiling 
water. Cover the kettle and boil fast for three quarters of an hour 



BBCIPBS. 195 

Boil a tea-cupful of rich milk or cream, thicken with a spoonful of 
flour, and pour over the cabbage, wlrich has been taken up into a vege- 
table dish and all the water drained ofE. Add a little salt and a 
sprinkle of cayenne. 

Cabbage with Milk. — Cut half of a solid head of cabbage fine as 
for slaw. Have a deep spider on the fire and hot. Put in your cab- 
bage, pour quickly over it a pint of boiling water, cover close, and 
cook for ten minutes ; then pour off the water that remains, and add 
half a pint of rich milk. When the milk boils up stir in a tea-spoon- 
ful of flour moistened with a little cream or milk, a sprinkle of salt, 
and cook the flour a minute, then dish up. 

Those who usually find cabbage an unpleasantly indigestible 
article of food will be gratified with the result of this mode of cooking 
it. It is quite like cauliflower, and is much cheaper. 

Dr. Everett's Choice. — Cut fine as much clean nice cabbage as 
will fill a spider. Place it in this utensil, cover with a plate, and let 
it cook till done in the steam from its own j uices. 

Onions. — The unpleasant breath which eating this vegetable pro- 
duces is perhaps the greatest objection to its use, but still it is a very 
wholesome and desirable article of food for many, and hence should 
be brought on the table in the most attractive form. White onions, 
and those grown in the South, are least odorous and pungent. Take 
off the outside skin, cut off both ends close, and let them stand in cold 
water an hour, then drop them into a saucepan with two quarts of 
boiling water. Cover, and boil fifteen minutes. Have a kettle of boil- 
ing water on the fire ready for use, pour off the water from the 
onions, and add as much more — be sure the water is boiling — and boil 
half an hour longer. Scald a cupful of rich milk, pour off the second 
water from the onions, add the milk and a little Graham flour to 
thicken it. Salt and otherwise season to taste. Boil up a few minutes 
and serve the onions whole ; or they may be cut in halves before 
cooking. 

Cold Slaw. — Take half a head of white cabbage, cut it into fine 
shreds, and put into a bowl or deep dish. Add the juice of a large 
lemon and two spoonfuls of cold water, and stir together ; then sift 
evenly over the cabbage three or four table-spoonfuls of granulated 
sugar ; shake the dish so that the sugar may be diffused, but do not 
stir it again. Let it stand ten or fifteen minutes and then serve. 

Grape or currant vinegar is very nice instead of lemon, and a pref 
erable acid with many. 

Potato Salad. — Cut six or eight cold potatoes into even, thin 
slices, and put into a salad dish. Cut fine, and sprinkle over the 
potatoes a tea-spoonful of parsley, and a little salt and cayenne. Stir 
half a tea-cupful of good cream until it is very smooth and foamy ; 
pour over the potatoes, and mix carefully, so as not to break the 
slices. A little prepared mustard, and a few stalks of white celery 
thopped fino, is an addition. This is a good dish for a hearty lunch.

Sweet Potatoes may be peeled, cut in thin slices or strips, and 
fried, lieating and buttering the skillet in the same way. They will 
not bear quite so hot a fire, nor take so long to cook. Use as little 
butter as possible. Fried food is not considered so wholesome as 
boiled or steamed, but is sometimes more convenient to prepare. 

Egg Plant.— Pare and cut into slices, half an inch thick, two or 
three egg plants, according to the size of your family, and put to soak 
in cold salted water for two hours. This removes a black, bitter 
juice, said to be unheal thful, certainly very disagreeable. Then press 
the slices between two plates, and wipe them on a clean cloth, then 
boil till soft enough to mash like turnips. Mash them smooth, add a 
few bread crumbs soaked in sweet cream, a little chopped parsley and 
salt, and a sprinkle of cayenne. Mix all thoroughly, pour into a but- 
tered baking dish, cover the top with bread crumbs, and bake half an 
hour. 

Catjliflower. — Soak the head two hours in cold salted water, and 
boil till tender in plenty of water. Have the water boiling when you 
put in the flower. Pour off the water, and add a cup of cream or 
milk. Rub together a tea-spoonful of butter and a large spoonful olf 
flour. Stir into the milk, season as you like, and let all boil up to- 
gether for five minutes and serve. 

Spinach. — Wash carefully in plenty of cold salt and water, put it 
into a saucepan that will just hold it, put in some salt, and pour over 
it a pint of boiling water. Cover close, and let it cook slowly twenty 
minutes. Drain off all the water, and pour over it a gill of scalded 
cream or a little butter, and it is ready for the table.

PIES. 

Pies are wholesome or not as they are well or badly made. An 
apple pie can be so prepared as to be nearly or quite as simple as 
bread, butter, and apple sauce. A whole meal may be made of it with- 
out injury to the health. On the other hand, it may be so prepared 
as to be unfit for the stomach of even a rhinoceros . The model pie is 
in our opinion the apple pie. Peach pies are highly relished by many ; 
but the peach loses its finest flavor by cooking, whereas the apple is 
improved by this process. Most of the berries in their season make 
good pies. So does rice and eggs, and the custard pie is not only deli 
cious but wholesome. Meat mince pies are not to be tolerated by deli- 
cate people ; though they may be eaten by men of strong digestion, 
who live much in the open air and do muscular work. The first 
point to be secured in a pie is good crust. In general terms, this 
Bhauld be thin and, when well baked, tender. It should not be sliort- 
ensd with lard, but the best of cream — or in the absence of this, good 
butter. Delicate fruits are soon tainted with the shortening of the 
crust. Many in baking pies, use too much crust. The less that can 
be used the better the pie will be. The crust should be thin, the fruit 
good pie-apples, and plenty of them, put between the crust. Where 
the two crusts meet on the edge of the dish, r^re should be taken to 



RECIPEft. ] 07 

have the apples pressed out, so that there shall not be a wide strip of 
thick crust with no apples near them. An apple pie should be euT**n 
just after it is cool. If eaten while hot, it is apt to go down only half 
masticated, and tiie effect of the heat on the tongue tends to destroy 
the finer sense of taste. After an apple pie is one day old it begins to 
grow stale, unless it is kept with great care. Soyer, the famous Lon- 
don pie-maker, thinks that if all the spoilt pies made in London on 
one single Sunday were placed in a row beside a railway, it would 
take an express-train an hour to pass them in review. Whoever will 
induce bakers to improve their methods of making them, will be a 
public benefactor. The usual price for a piece of pie in a New York 
restaurant is ten cents. They could be afforded for half that price, at 
a profit, too, if there were no spoiled pies. 

The following receipts for pie pastry will be found excellent. They 
may be varied somewhat to suit individual tastes, provided only the 
general rules be kept in view. We commend the cream shortening as 
better than any other. 

Good Pie Crust. — A quart of flour will make two large pies. Sift 
the flour. Take a large, strong spoon, and stir into the flour one quar- 
ter of a pound of butter and a tea-spoonful of yeast powder ; then 
moisten with cold water — ice water if you have it — using just as little 
as will make the flour stick together. Sprinkle some of the shortened 
flour on the pie-board, and roll the crust large enough for the pie-pan ; 
do not try to make smooth edges until you have put in the filling, 
and the upper crust ; then press the edges firmly together and cut off 
the rough edges with a knife. The secret of good, tender, plain pas- 
try is speedy work — no working with the warm hands. 

Cream and Potato Pastry. — Six good-sized potatoes, boiled and 
mashed, mealy, and white, one tea-cup of sweet cream, half tea-spoon- 
ful of salt, and flour enough to make it stay together, and roll out. 
Work and handle as little as possible, and roll thicker than for com- 
mon pastry. 

This is Mrs. Beecher's receipt for "pastry for meat pies," and is 
exactly what a wholesome fruit pie needs. Light tart apples, cut in 
thin slices, and filled into such a crust with a table-spoonful of water 
and two of sugar added, and a top-crust, baked half an hour, will be 
good enough for an epicure. ' 

Mrs. Cox's Method. — Pour sufficient boiling water upon wheat 
meal to make a stiff dough , roll, without kneading, to any desired 
thickness, from an eighth to a half inch. 

Note.— This make? a very tender crust, quite as much po as can be made In the 
ordinary way. It may be made of superfine floor, or rye meal, or a mixture of dif- 
feieut kinds. 

To have the crust tender, it must not be kneaded, but rolled oat 
with plenty of meal on the board. 

Mattie Jones' Cream Pie Crust. — Take equal quantities of 
Graham flour, white flour, and Indian meal ; rub evenly together, and 



198 KBCIPES, 

wet with very thin sweet cream. It should be rolled thin and baked 
in an oven as hot as for common pie crust. 

NoTB. — This makes excellent pastry if properly baked. Many patients have said 
to ut« they did not see how they could ever again relish the pastry in common use 
(this is so much sweeter and more palatable, to say nothing of its wholesomeness). 

Apple Pies. — Take nice, tart apples — spitzenbergs are best, al- 
though pippins, greenings, russets, etc., are excellent. Slice them ; 
fill the under crust an inch thick ; sprinkle sugar over them ; add a 
spoonful or two of water ; cover with a thin crust, and bake three- 
fourths of an hour in a moderate oven. 

Another. — Peel and cut about two pounds of apples — sharp ones 
being the best for the purpose ; cat each into four pieces, removing 
the cores ; then cut each quarter into two or three pieces, according to 
the size. Put half of them into a pie-dish, slightly press them down ; 
put over them two ounces of brown sugar ; put in the remaining ap- 
ples ; then add another tv/o ounces of sugar, making the apples form 
a kind of dome, the center being two inches higher than the sides ; 
add a small wine-glass of water ; cover the top with paste, and bake 
in a moderate oven from half to three-quarters of an hour. 

Mock Apple Pie. — For a large pie-plate, two crackers (milk or 
Boda), one egg, one cup of sugar, one of water, and the juice of one 
lemon ; add a pinch of salt, and spice with nutmeg or the rind of the 
lemon. This is quite a tolerable counterfeit. 

Apple Puffs. — Peel and core six tart apples, cook quickly with 
very little water ; cover close so as to make them white and free from 
lumps ; when done to a puff, sprinkle over them two heaping spoon- 
fuls of sugar, and stir smooth. Set to cool. Prepare your pastry. 
Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, stir into the apples and 
fill the crust ; grate a little nutmeg or cinnamon over the top. No top 
crust. Bake in a quick oven, only long enough to cook the pastry. 

Apple Float. — A pint of stewed, well mashed apples ; whites of 
three eggs, four large spoonfuls of sugar, beaten until stiff ; then add 
the apples and beat all together until stiff enough to stand alone. Fill 
a deep dish with rich cream, boiled soft custard, and pile the float on 
top. This is excellent with other fruits in place of apples. 

French Apple Turnovers. — Eight large apples ; eight ounces of 
sugar ; two ounces of butter, and the rind of a lemon. 

Prepare the apples as for a pie ; put them into a saucepan with the 
sugar, butter, the rind of a lemon rubbed on a piece of sugar, and two 
table-spoonfuls of water ; cover the pan, and set it over a slow fire, 
turning it occasionally till the apples are about half done, and pour 
them into .a basin to cool. Roll out a piece of paste in a circular form, 
the eighth of an inch thick, and about the size of a dinner-plate ; wet 
it round, and fasten a rolled cord of paste within an inch of the edge ; 
put in the prepared apples, raising them in the center in the form of a 
dome spread some apricot or orange marmalade over the surface, 
and cover the whole with another circular piece of paste, and press 
the edges together, or fold them over in the form of a cord. Spread 



EECIPES. 199 

Bonie beaten white of egg all over the top with a soft paste-brush ; then 
strew coarsely pounded or rough granite sugar over the entire sur- 
face, and bake lightly in a moderately hot oven. 

Jam TuRNOVEiRS. — Roll out some short paste about one-eighth of an 
inch thick ; cut it in pieces about four inches in length, and between 
two and three inches in breadth ; lay on each a little apple jam, or any 
other preserved fruit, without syrup ; turn the edges over, wetting 
them, as little as possible, with water ; press them lightly together, 
and also the ends ; lay them on tins, and bake in a moderately hot 
oven. Ice them very perfectly, and return them to the oven for a 
few minutes, or set them in a Dutch or American oven before the 
fire. 

Apple Pie Cake. — Mix unbolted wheat with cold water, making 
a batter soft enough to nearly level itself. If shortening is desired, 
use sweet cream or butter. Fill a rather deep pie-plate about a third 
full of the batter, and sprinkle over a little su^ar. Wash, quarter, 
and core tart apples, and place as many in the batter (skin side 
up) as it will hold. They may be pressed down and leveled with a 
stifE spoon. Over the top sprinkle some sugar, and bake till nicely 
brown. 

This cake is both wholesome, nutritious, and delicious. Children 
and grown folks can eat of it freely without injury. 

Cocoa-Nut Pies. — Open the ei/es of a cocoa-nut with a pointed 
knife or a gimlet, and pour out the milk into a cup ; then break the 
shell and take out the meat and grate it fine. Take the same weight 
of sugar and the grated nut and stir together ; beat four eggs, the 
whites and yolks separately, to a stiff foam ; mix one cup of cream, and 
the milk of the cocoa-nut with the sugar and nut, then add the eggs 
and a few drops of orange or lemon extract. Line deep pie-tins with 
a nice crust, fill them with the custard and bake carefully half an hour. 

Lemon Pie. — For each peeled and grated lemon add one tea-cup of 
sugar, and one table-spoonful of corn-starch dissolved in cold water. 
Over this pour a tea-cup of boiling water. 

Crust. One part white flour, one part Graham flour, one part corn- 
meal. Shorten it with butter or condensed milk, reduced one-third. 
Use two crusts. 

The above recipe for lemon pie is used in our Institution, and has 
given perfect satisfaction. 

Another Recipe. — Take two lemons, two eggs, one cup of sugar, 
one cup of water, and one large table-spoonful of flour. After grating 
the peel, take off and throw away the white rind, and cut the lemou 
in small pieces. Carefully picking out the seeds. After the under 
crust is laid in, sugar it well. Bake with two crusts. Lemon pie is 
not quite so easily managed by the stomach, and should be eaten more 
sparingly than apple pie. 

Pumpkin or Squash Pie. — Cut the pumpkin into small pieces; 
take out the seeds and inside, but do not pare it. It must be a well- 
grown and thoroughly ripened pumpkin, and not watery. Put- the 



200 EECIPBS. 

pieces into a sauce-pan witli only a few spoonfuls of water, not more 
than four ; cover close and let it cook gently so as not to scorch, until 
the water has all evaporated, and the pumpkin has cooked quite dry 
and of a rich, dark, orange color. While hot, sift it through a coarse 
sieve. Season only as much as you are needing for the day. For one 
large pie, one egg, one table- spoonful of molasses, four i iible-spoonf uls 
of condensed milk, or enough of new milk to make it as thin as you 
wish ; or, if you have it, half milk and half cream, instead of con- 
densed milk. Sugar to suit the taste. 

Another. — Select a pumpkin which has a deep, rich color, and 
firm, close texture. Stew and sift in the ordinary manner; add as 
much boiling milk as will make it about one-third thicker than for 
common pumpkin pie. Sweeten with equal quantities of sugar and 
molasses, and bake about one hour in a hot oven. 

Note. — Those who will try this method will ha surprised to find how delicious a 

Eie can be made without eggs*, ginger, or spices of any "kind. The milk bein^ turned 
oiling hot upon the pumpkin," causes it to swell in baking, so that it is as light and 
nice as though eggs had been used. 



■'DO'- 



Squash Pie. — This is even superior to pumpkin, as it possesses a 
richer, sweeter flavor, and is far preferable. It is made in precisely 
the same manner as pumpkin pie. 

Sweet Potato Pie. — Boil and sift through a colander, nice, ripe, 
sweet potatoes, add boiling milk, and make the same as pumpkin pie. 

Sweet Apple Pie. — Pare mellow, sweet apples, and grate them 
upon a grater. A very large grater is necessary for this purpose. 
Then proceed as for pumpkin pie. 

Note. — The four receipts last mentioned, are from Mrs. Jones' Cook-book, a 
work of which thousands have been sold, and which has been republished in Eng- 
.and. 

Rice Pie. — Take cold rice, cooked in milk ; add sufficient cream to 
make quite thin ; mash it with a wooden or silver spoon till free from 
lumps. Beat up four eggs very light — yolks and whites separately ; 
sweeten to suit your taste, and pour in the eggs — the whites last ; stir 
well ; cover a deep custard or pumpkin pie-plate with pastry, pour in 
the rice, and bake, but not long enough to make the custard watery. 

Rice pie should be made thick, and eaten when fresh, but not till 
after it is cold. Children are fond of it, and may be allowed as much 
as they wish. 

Cbanberry Pie, — Stew a few good, ripe, sweet apples, and add an 
equal quantity of cranberries. Cover a deep plate with a crust, and 
fill even full ; roll the upper crust, and cut in strips half an inch wide 
and lay across the pie, leaving the spaces diamond-shaped, and bake. 

Strawberry Pie. — Place the under crust upon a deep plate, and 
the upper one — cut just the right size— on a flat tin or sheet-iron 
prick to prevent blistering, and bake. Fill the deep dish while hot 
with strawberries, and cover with the flat crust. If the fruit is rathei 
hard, replace in the oven till heated ; if quite ripe, the crust will steam 
them sufficiently. 



RECIPES. 201 

Raspberry and blackberry pie may be made in the same manner. 
The flavor of these delicious berries, when quite ripe, is greatly in- 
jured by cooking ; and they are also changed to a mass of little else 
than seeds and juice. 

Mipe Berry Pies, generally, may be prepared as above, and baked 
till the fruit is cooked, which takes only a few minutes. This method 
is much better than baking the fruit with the crust, as the greater part 
of the juice is often lost before the crust is cooked. 

Berry Tarts. — Cover gem-pans with crust, as for little pies, and 
bake ; when nearly done, fill up with berries and replace in the over 
a few minutes. 

NoTB. — The four receipts mentioned above, are from Mrs. Cox'a Hygiene Cook 
hook, a radical, but thooghtfal little book of one hundred pages, which will repa} 
a careful reading. 

Pie for Dyspeptics. — Four table-spoonfuls of oatmeal, one pint of 
water ; let stand a few hours, or till the meal is well swelled. Then 
add two large apples, pared and sliced, a little salt, one cup of sugar, 
one table- spoonful of liour. Mix all well together and bake in a but- 
♦«red pie-dish ; and you have a most delicious pie, which may be eaten 
with safety by the sick or well. 

We might go on giving other receipts for pies ; but trust to the in- 
genuity of the reader to get up her own methods, bearing in mind al- 
ways the rule that they be healthfully made. 

CUSTARDS. 

Almond Custards. — One pint of milk ; half a pint of cream ; one 
ounce and a half of sweet almonds ; five yolks and two whites of 
eggs, and four ounces of white sugar. Boil the milk and cream with 
a small stick of cinnamon ; pour into a basin, and when cool, take out 
cinnamon ; set the milk on a slow fire, adding the sugar, the eggs, 
well beaten, and the almonds, blanched and chopped fine ; stir on the 
fire till thick, but do not allow it to boil ; pour it into a jug or bowl, 
stirring it frequently till cold, and serve in custard glasses. 

Arrowroot Custards. — One ounce of arrowroot ; three-quarters 
of a pint of milk , three ounces of sugar, and four eggs. Mix the 
arrowroot with a quarter of a pint of cold milk, adding the eggs, well 
beaten, the sugar, and a little almond-flavor ; add half a pint of boil- 
ing milk, stirring constantly, and when cold, serve in custard glasses. 

Milk Custard. — One pint of new milk ; one table-spoonful of flour; 
one table-spoonful of thick cream ; cinnamon ; almond-flavor, and sugar. 
Set the milk over the fire with a little cinnamon, stirring it till quite 
hot, but not allowing it to boil. Mix the cream and flour together ; 
pour on the hot milk ; stir well, adding the almond-flavor, and sugar. 
Bake lightly, without crust, in a moderate oven. 

Another. — One quart of new milk ; sugar, and one stick of cinna- 
mon. Boil the cinnamon in a pan with the new milk ; take the pan 
off the fire, and stir in the sugar. Bake in pie or pudding dishes,

lined with custard paste. The paste should be pricked with a fork, 
but not through to the dish, and partly baked before the custard is 
put in. Egg custard may be made in the same way, allowing five or 
six eggs, according to size, to a quart of new milk. 

Baked Custards. — One pint of cream ; four eggs ; cinnamon ; al- 
mond-flavor, and three ounces of sugar. Boil the cream with a piece 
of cinnamon ; pour it into a basin, and when cold, add the eggs, well 
beaten and strained, the sugar powdered, and a few drops of almond- 
flavor. Bake in small cups, in a cool oven. 

Plain Custards. — The same, without any condiments. One quart 
of new milk ; the yolks of eight and the whites of four eggs ; five 
ounces of sugar ; quarter of a pint of cream ; the rind of a lemon, and 
a small stick of cinnamon. Boil the milk with the cinnamon, sugar^ 
and the rind of the lemon, pared very thin ; when the milk has boil- 
ed a few minutes, pour it into a bowl ; beat the eggs, adding the 
cream, and mix well in the milk ; then strain the whole into the pan, 
and set it on a slow fire, stirring constantly till near boiling ; pour it 
into a jug, stirring it till nearly cold, and serve in custard glasses. 

Gooseberry Custards. — Three pints of green gooseberries ; quar- 
ter of a pound of sugar ; four ^ggs, and two table-spoonfuls of orange- 
flower water. Set the gooseberries in cold water over a slow fire, and 
simmer till soft ; then drain the water away, and rub them through a 
sieve ; to a pint of pulp add the eggs, the sugar, and orange-flower 
water ; set it over the fire, stirring constantly till it becomes thick, 
and when cold, serve in custard glasses. 

Lemon Custards. — Eight eggs ; six ounces of sugar ; two lemons ; 
a tea-cupful of cream ; one pint of boiling water, anci two table-spoon- 
fuls of orange-flower water. Beat the yolks of the eggs till quite 
frothy ; pour on them the boiling water, stirring quickly all the time ; 
add the sugar, and the rind of the lemons, grated ; stir it over a slow 
fire, till thick, adding the cream, and orange-flower water ; when 
hot, stir in the lemon-juice ; pour it into a basin ; stir till nearly 
cold, and serve in custard glasses. 

Lemon Custards. — One large lemon ; one quart of new milk ; 
quarter of a pound of white sugar, and seven eggs. Grate off the 
rind of the lemon ; put it with the sugar in the milk, and boil quarter 
of an hour ; strain, and let it remain till cool ; then stir in the eggs, 
well beaten and strained, leaving out three whites ; pour it into cups 
with half a tea-spoonful of fresh butter, melted, in each cup ; set them 
in water, and bake in a moderate oven ; color them when done, by 
holding a hot salamander over, and serve cold, with sugar sifted on the 
wop. 

Raspberry Custards. — One pint of cream ; three quarters of a 
pint of raspberry juice, and half a pound of white sugar. Boil the 
cream ; dissolve the sugar in the raspberry juice ; mix it with the 
ooiling cream, stirring it till quiie thick, and serve in custard glasses. 

RrcE Custards, — One ounce and a half of ground rice ; three ounces 
of loaf sugar, and one -pint of new milk. Boil the rice in the milk. 



RECIPES. 203 

adding the sugar, and a piece of cinnamon ; pour it into custard cups, iu 
which a little fresh butter has been melted, and bake in a slow oven. 

Vanilla Custards. — One stick of vanilla ; one pint and a half of 
new milk ; half a pint of cream ; quarter of a pound of white sugai, 
and seven yolks and four whites of eggs. Cut the vanilla into slips ; 
boil in the milk and cream quarter of an hour, adding the sugar ; 
atrain, and let it remain till cool; then stir iu the eggs, well beaten ; 
pour it into cups with half a tea-spoonful of fresh butter, melted, in 
each cup ; set them in water ; bake in a moderate oven ; color them 
when done by holding a hot salamander over, and serve cold, with 
sugar sifted on the top. 

White Custards. — One pint of cream ; three ounces of sugar ; the 
whites of four eggs, and one table-spoonful of orange-flower water. 
Boil the cream with a blade of mace ; let it simmer for about five 
minutes ; then take it off the fire, and add the sugar ; beat the whites 
of the eggs to a comj)lete froth ; put them into the cream ; set it on 
the fire again, and let it boil gently, stirring constantly, till it becomes 
thick; take it off the fire; add tlie orange-flower water, or a few drops 
of almond-flavor, and serve in custard glasses. 

Note. — Cuatards are both wholesome and nutritiou9, eppecially for delicate Ptom- 
Aphs, and for those recovering from sickni'ss, especially if used in moderation, they 
supply the waste of nerve-tiHt*ue better than meals or breads. The custard pie ia 
made by baking the custard iu an appropriate crust. 



PUDDINGS. 

Rice Pudding. — One cup of fresh whole rice ; nine cupf ula of new 
milk, and one cup of sugar. Put into a stone or earthen pan, and 
'i)ake in a moderate oven three hours. Stir it two or three times during 
the first hour ; do not increase the heat of the oven after the milk be- 
gins to simmer : be careful not to scorch or blister ; a light cover to- 
ward the last will be better. Set to cool undisturbed. It is best eaten 
cold. Raisins may be added, if desired. 

Another. — Five tea-cupfuls of rice picked and washed ; fifteen 
quarts of new milk ; one and a half pound of white sugar ; one pound 
of raisins. Bake three hours in a moderate oven ; stir it occasionally 
for two hours ; then leave it to brow^n over. This makes a delicious 
pudding, plain and simple. 

Bread Pudding. — To one loaf of bread, well grated, pour two quarts 
of boiled milk or cream ; four eggs : a quarter of a pound of white 
sugar ; flavor to the taste (mace is a very good flavor), and bake an 
hour. If the boiled milk is poured upon pieces of stale bread and left 
standing two hours, they can be mashed and freed from lumps with 
the hand before putting in the eggs. Dried currants, that have been 
well washed and swelled in lukewarm water, or raisins, will be a good 
addition to this pudding. If made with crackers it will be still more 
delicate. Cold sauce may be eaten with it or fruit sauce, if no fruit is 
put into the pudding.

Apple aj^d Tapdca Pudding. — Put a tea-cupful of tapioca into a 
quart of warm water before breakfast ; set it where it will keep warm 
for three hours ; stir it from the bottom once or twice and keep covered. 
Pare and cut in thin slices five or six nice tart apples, and lay them 
in the bottom of the pudding-dish ; add a heaped cupful of sugar, 
dissolved in hot water, to the tapioca ; stir well together, and pour 
over the apples ; bake slowly for two hours. To be eaten with whipped 
cream flavored with a little lemon or orange. Good either hot or cold. 

Graham Gem Pudding. — Take six cold gems — yesterday's baking ; 
break them into small pieces, and pour over them one pint of cold 
water ; cover and let them soften for an hour ; then add a pint and a 
half of new milk ; a handful of seeded raisins or currants ; one beaten 
egg, and one tea-spoonful of cream -yeast. Mix half a cup of sugar and 
the cream-yeast thoroughly together, before putting them with the 
other ingredients. Stir together well and quickly ; butter the pud- 
ding-dish with cold, sweet butter, and bake in a quick oven three- 
fourths of an hour. 

Steamed Graham Pudding. — Sour milk or fresh buttermilk, five 
cupf uls ; brown sugar, two cups ; butter, half a cup ; two tea-spoon- 
fuls of soda ; two eggs ; half a pound of seeded dates. Graham flour 
enough to make a thin Ijatter. The dates should be chopped fine and 
rolled in flour before they are put into the batter. Steam for three 
hours. Make a sauce of milk and cornstarch, or eat with good cream. 

Apple and Bread Pudding. — Break and rub bread fine ; peel and 
chop good, sweetish apples — sweet apples keep their place, and take 
a little longer to cook ; butter a pudding-dish, then put a layer of 
apples an inch deep, then a layer of bread-crumbs not quite so thick, 
then another layer of apples, alternating, till the dish is full ; bread 
being last. A little butter may be added to each layer of bread, or a 
table-spoonful of cream sprinkled over each. Bake an hour, or till the 
apples are thoroughly cooked. Serve with sweet sauce, or cream. 

Cherry Pudding. — One quart of scalded milk; one pint of corn 
meal ; half a pint of Graham flour, or a little less of fine flour ; foui 
eggs well beaten ; a tea-spoonful of yeast-powder, and a pint of ripe 
cherries ; wash, and pick out the imperfect cherries ; leave the seeds 
in ; drain oflE all the water, and roll the cherries, while damp, in 
some of the flour. Stir all together ; put into a pudding-mould or bag, 
and boil two hours. To be eaten with sugar and cream. The late 
black cherries are the best for this pudding. They are not so juicy, 
retain their shape, and diffuse a rich purple tint around them, which 
makes the pudding handsome for the table. 

Poor Man's Pudding. — One cup of flour ; one cup of cornmeal ; one 
table-spoonful of cream-yeast powder mixed well with the meal and 
flour ; two cups of rich milk ; one cup of molasses ; one cup of cur- 
rants washed and rolled in flour ; one table-spoonful of butter rubbed 
evenly and cold into the pudding-mould. Mix the ingredients well 
together ; put into the mould, and boil three hours. Be careful 4o 
keep the pudding-mould upright in the boiling kettle. Do not allow 
the water to stop boiling at any time, or to boil over the top of the

ntould, as it is almost impossible to have the lid so close that water 
will not get in and quite spoil the pudding. When done turn the pud- 
ding out of the mould into a broad platter and serve hot with cream 
sauce. 

Note. — The -poor man'? pudding may suggest the possibility of not having a moiUa 
to boil it in. A small, high tin pail with a lid which can be lied down tig-ht will do 
quite a8 well, though it may have to boil an hour longer, to cook the center of the 
pudding. A pu(!diii^-bag dipped in cold water and floured inside is just at* good. 
The puddiug-muuld i» a great convenience, not an essential. 

Cottage Pudding. — One-half cup of sugar ; one egg ; one cupful 
of cream ; one pint of flour ; one heaping tea-spoonful of Taylor's 
cream-yeast. Bake in a cake-pan. To be eaten with a hot, sweet 
eauce, or with cold cream. 

Graham Birdsnest Pudding— Is made by laying in a deep dish 
nice quartered apples, and pouring over them a thin batter made of 
flour ; one tea-cup of sour milk, and about one-third of a tea-spo<3nful 
of soda. Bake in a moderate oven till the apples are thoroughly 
cooked. 

Tapioca Custard Pudding. — Soak two table-spoons tapioca over 
night in cold water ; when ready to make custard, boil one quart milk; 
while boiling add beaten yolks of three eggs, three- fourths cup sugar, 
and the tapioca ; turn in the dish you wish to serve it in ; have the 
beaten whites ready, sweetened a little and spread over top ; put in 
oven and just brown a little. Eat cold. 

Delmonico Pudding. — Three table-spoonfuls cornstarch ; one 
quart boiling milk ; three eggs, whites and yolks separated. Mix 
yolks with cornstarch and add milk gradually. Let it boil. Beat 
whites to stiff froth, sweeten. Put cornstarch in pudding-dish, cover 
with frosting and set in oven to brown. To be eaten cold. 

Nice Cheap Pudding. — One quart of milk; four table-spoonfuls of 
flour ; four eggs ; six table-spoonfuls of sugar ; nutmeg. Steam three- 
fourths of an hour. 

Sago Pudding. — One dozen tart apples ; one and a half cups of 
sago ; soak the sago till soft ; peel and core the apples, and place in a 
dish ; fill the apples with sugar ; pour the sago over, and bake till tho 
apples are cooked. 

Sago Birdsnest Pudding — Is made by laying quartered fresh 
apples, or stewed dried ones, in a pan about half full, and pouring 
over them the sago, prepared as for a thin mush ; then bake in a 
moderate oven till the apples are cooked ; say an hour or more, accord- 
ing to the size of the pudding. 

Indian Pudding. — Extra good. — Two tea-cups of commeal ; half a 
cup of superfine flour ; one cup of syrup ; half a tea-spoonful of salt. 
Scald three quarts of milk; and stir into the above. Let it stand half 
an hour — stir it again. Bake quickly until it boils, then slowly about 
two hours.

A Simple Cornmeal Pudding. — Stir into a quart of boiling milt 
the yolks of two eggs, three heaping spoonfuls of meal and a half a 
cup of sugar, well beaten together. Cook five minutes, stirring con- 
Btantly ; remove from the fire, and add the whites, beaten to a stiff 
froth. Pour into a pudding-dish, and bake one hour in a moderate 
oven. Serve with cream and sugar. 

Batter Pudding. — Take a half pound of flour ; one pint of milk ; 
two eggs, and one tea-spoonful of baking powder. Rub the baking- 
powder quite smooth ; mix it well with the flour, then stir in nearly 
half of the milk, and beat it perfectly smooth ; add the remainder of 
the milk and the eggs, well beaten ; boil the pudding one and a half 
hours, in a buttered basin, and serve with sweet sauce ; or put it into 
a buttered dish, and bake it in a quick oven. 

Baked Batter Pudding with Fruit. — Take a half-pound of 
flour ; one pint of milk ; the yolks of four, and whites of two eggs, 
and half a tea-spoonful of baking-powder. Rub the powder till smooth, 
mixing it well with the flour, and as much milk as will make it a stiff 
batter ; beat it till quite smooth, then add the remainder of the milk, 
and the eggs, well beaten. Put some apples, cut as for a pie, into a 
buttered dish ; pour the batter over, and bake in a moderately hot 
oven. Damsons, currants, gooseberries, or rhubarb, may be used in 
the same way. 

CAKES. 

Cake is good and wholesome when it is plain and simple. It 
is bad when it is too rich and compounded of too many ingredients. 
It may be eaten freely like bread in the former case. In the latter it 
had better. not be eaten at all. Children are generally fond of cake. 
It ought always to be so made that they can eat of it without injuring 
the vigor of the stomach, which should always be preserved. We would 
always have the family cake made of the best of coarse flour. It is 
sweeter and more wholesome. Most of the following receipts are such 
as have been used in our Institution for years ; a few are favorites at 
other institutions. All may be varied to suit individual wants, always 
keeping in mind the two words, simplicity and healthfulness. 

Cookies for Forty or Fifty. — Four cups of sugar ; one cup of 
butter ; two cups of sour milk ; two tea- spoonfuls of cream-yeast, 
brown or white ; flour sufficient to roll them out. Work them but 
little ; make them thin, and bake in a quick oven. 

Cup Cake for Seventy-five or Eighty. — Four cups sugar 
(white) ; one of butter ; four eggs ; rub these together ; then add three 
tea-cups of sweet milk ; ten tea-spoonfuls Taylor's cream-yeast, mixed 
with the flour of which you use a sufficient quantity to make the whole 
into a stiff batter. 

Graham Cup Cake. — Unbolted wheat meal, two cupf uls ; buttermilk, 
one cup; molasses, half -cup ; butter, quarter of a cup; eggs, two; 
soda, half a tea-spoonful. Bake half an hour. 



RECIPES. . 207 

Drop Cakes. — Pat six well-beaten eggs into a pint of thick cream 
add a little salt, and make it into a thick batter with flour. Bake it 
in rings or in small cups fifteen or twenty minutes. The same may 
be made with Graham flour. 

Delicious Corn Gem Cake. — One quart of cornmeal ; two quarts 
of sweet milk : two heaped teaspoonfuls of cream-yeast ; two eggs. 
Bake in a quick oven. 

Strawberry Shortcake. — To a quart of flour (enough for two 
cakes) put three heaping spoonfuls of baking-powder (Taylor's). Sift 
together thoroughly and rub in one ounce of butter. Wet with a i)int 
of sweet milk, using a spoon. The mixture will be somewhat softer 
than common pie-crust. Do not try to mould or roll out the dough. 
Spread it on tin pie-plates by patting with the hand. It should be 
about an inch in thickness. Bake slowly at first till the cakes have 
had time to rise ; then increase the heat, and expect them to be done 
within twenty-five minutes. Split the cakes hot from the oven ; 
spread the halves with butter (liberally if good), and cover them with 
the fruit previously sweetened. Place one on the other (the upper 
half is reversed of course), or each on a plate by itself. It is a good 
rule to sugar your strawberries before you begin to make your cake, 
and if they are large, or not very ripe, it is best to cut them in two, or 
mash them a little. Don't calculate for these cakes standing on the 
stove hearth a minute. They should be served like griddle-cakes — no 
time lost between the oven and the table. Observe these rules and 
you will have a dish as dainty as Izaak Walton's Baked Fish, of which 
he said, '* It is too good for any but very honest people." When straw- 
berries are gone, red raspberries (Clark's or Philadelphia) are very nice 
in their place. White currants are also very much liked as a substi- 
tute, and peach shortcake is hardly surpassed by the strawberry itself, 
if the peaches are first-rate. All these fruits should be prepared by 
sweetening an hour or two before wanted. 

Shakespeare Cake. — Six cups of flour ; one of sugar ; one of rich 
cream ; eight eggs. 

Orange Cake. — Two cups of sugar ; yolk of five eggs and white of 
four ; half a cup of water ; two cups of flour ; one teaspoon!" ul of bak- 
ing-powder, juice and grated rind of one orange. Spread and bake on 
tin pie-plates. This quantity should cover six plates. Make a jelly 
by beating the white of one egg to a froth, and adding to it three 
quarters of a pound of powdered sugar, and the grated rind and juice 
of another orange. Spread the jelly on the cakes and lay one above 
another in three tiers. 

Silver Cake. — Two and a half cups of flour ; half a cup of butter ; 
two cups of sugar ; three-fourths of a cup of sweet milk ; white oi 
eight eggs ; two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. 

Gold Cake. — Two cups of flour; three-fourths of a cup of butter; 
Dne cup of sugar ; one egg, and the yolk of eight eggs ; two spoonfuls 
of baking-powder. 



208 BECIPES. 

Italian Cream. — One quart of cream reduced by one pint of milk, 
and set on ice to cool. Beat the cream and milk with a good egg- 
beater fifteen minutes thoroughly. Dissolve two ounces of gelatine in 
a gill of water, and strain it through a flannel bag into the cream. Add 
two cups of sugar and flavor, if desired, with lemon or vanilla. Stir 
briskly for three or four minutes ; pour into serving-dishes and set on 
ice to cool. 

Cookies. — One cup of butter ; two of sugar ; half a cup of milk ; 
four eggs ; two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder ; half a nutmeg. As 
little flour as possible, and roll out. 

Sponge Cake. — Six eggs ; the weight of six eggs in sugar, and the 
weight of four in flour, with lemon extract, or a little grated lemon 
peel ; a little salt, and a spoonful of baking-powder. 

Delicate Cake. — When making cocoanut- custard use the whites 
of the eggs as follows : One cup of white sugar ; five table-spoonfuls of 
butter ; whites of six eggs ; one teacup of sweet milk ; three cups of 
prepared flour, or to the same quantity of common flour add one tea- 
spoonful of soda, and two of cream-of -tartar sifted in the flour. Flavor 
with orange, lemon, or vanilla. 

NoTB. — So Bays Mrs. Beecher : " We would substitute a teacupf ul of sweet, rich 
cream, instead of the milk and butter. Also, cream-yeast instead of prepared flour, 
or soda and cream-of- tartar." We give in this connection a recipe for cocoanut- 
custard, as the two can be more economically made at the same baking. 

Cocoanut Custard. — One pound of grated cocoanut ; one pint of 
rich milk, and six ounces of sugar. Beat the yolks of six eggs and 
stir them into the milk with the nut and sugar. Put into a farina- 
kettle, or into a small pail which you can set into a kettle of boiling 
water. Stir all the time till very smooth and thick ; as soon as it 
comes to a boil take off and pour into cups. 

Ground Rice Cake. — Break five eggs into a stewpan, which place 
in another, containing hot water ; whip the eggs for ten minutes till 
very light ; then mix in by degrees half a pound of ground rice ; six 
ounces of powdered sugar ; beat it well ; any flavor may be introduced ; 
pour into a buttered pan and bake half an hour. 



MOLDED FAEINACEA. 

Arrowroot. — Take four ounces of arrowroot, one quart of new 
milk, and four ounces of white sugar. Set a pint and a half of milk 
on the fire, adding the sugar ; when boiling, put in the arrowroot, 
previously mixed till perfectly smooth with half a pint of cold milk, 
and stir constantly till it has boiled three minutes ; and pour it into a 
mold previously dipped in cold water. 

Barley. — Six ounces of Scotch barley ; three pints and a half of 
water, and six ounces of sugar. Steep the barley twelve hours ; 
drain it, and pour the water, boiling, upon it ; stew quickly in the 
oven in an earthenware jar, covered, till perfectly soft, and all the 
water is absorbed ; when about half boiled enough, add the sugar, and 



RECIPES. 200 

& few drops of pure lemon juice ; pour it into a mold, and let it stand 
to set. When boiled quickly, the above quantity requires two hours 
and a half, and is a much better color than when it is longer in prep- 
aration. 

Molded Rice. — Take eight ounces of rice and one and a half pints 
of milk. Wash, and swell the rice in the milk, till the whole of 
the milk is absorbed and the rice thoroughly softened ; then pressing 
it into a mold or basin for half an hour, with a weight upon it, 
serve it, turned out, with preserved or stewed fruit. 

Molded Sago. —Take five tablespoonfuls of sago ; one-fourth 
pound of sugar, and a little pure lemon juice. Steep tlie sago a quar- 
ter of an hour in half a pint of cold water. Pour on it one and a 
half pints of boiling water, and boil the whole in an earthen vessel in 
the oven about one hour, occasionally stirring it. Pour into molds or 
basins, and let it stand. When cold, turn it out, and serve with 
stewed fruit. 

Sago with Fruit. — Take four ounces of sago ; half a pint of 
raspberry and currant juice (strained), and six ounces of loaf sugar. 
Wash the sago and steep it one hour in cold water ; strain oflE the water ; 
add the juice and boil gently a short time, stirring it occasionally, and 
adding the sugar ; when clear, pour it into a mold ; let it stand 
twelve hours, and pour it on a flat dish. 

Tapioca. — Take three ounces of tapioca, two ounces of ground 
rice, one pint and a half of milk, and eight drops of almond-flavor. 
Wash the tapioca in water two or three times ; mix with the ground 
rice ; add half a pint of cold milk, and let it remain thirty minutes ; 
then add the remainder of the milk, and simmer it half an hour, 
stirring well the whole time ; add the almond-flavor, and pour it into 
a mold previously dipped in cold water. 

Cracked Wheat. — For a quart of the cracked grain have two 
quarts of water boiling in a smooth iron pot over a quick fire ; stir in 
the wheat slowly ; boil fast and stir constantly for the first half hour 
of cooking, or until it begins to thicken and " pop up ; " then lift from 
the quick fire and place the pot where the wheat will cook slowly 
for an hour longer. Keep it covered closely, stir now and then, and 
be careful not to let it burn at the bottom. 

Wlieat cooked thus is much sweeter and richer than when left to 
soak and simmer for hours, as many think necessary. White wheat 
cooks the easiest. When ready to dish out, have your molds moistened 
with cold water, cover lightly, and set in a cool place. A handful 
of raisins added with the wheat is an addition. Eat warm or cold, 
with milk and sugar, or fruit. 

MISCELLANEOUS DISHES. 

A story is told of an old doctor who always emptied the odds and 
ends of every medicine he used into a large bottle, and when he had a 
patient that he was in doubt about as to what medicine he needed, he 
always gave him a dose from this bottle. " Some one of the man^

drags will meet the case," said he : so in this list of miscellaneoua 
dishes, which were not properly classified, or were received after the 
foregoing portion of this work was in type, something will be found to 
meet the wants of the table when the good house-wife don'i know 
what else to get. We shall commence the list with a recipe for 
making Dr. Heald's favorite bread. It was, so far as we know, 
invented by the Doctor and his good wife, and is much used in his 
Institution, We also add a few other bread recipes recently sent in 
by our correspondents : — 

Dk. Heald's Favorite Bread. — Stir the best white wheat meal 
into cold water, until the batter so formed can no longer be worked 
with the spoon. Then sprinkle meal upon your bread-board, and 
knead the dough thoroughly for ten, fifteen, or twenty minutes, as you 
have time, and desire the bread softer or harder. Work in all the 
meal you can while kneading. The more you knead it and incorporate 
air with it the lighter and better it will be. When sufficiently kneaded, 
roll out with the hands on the board into a cylindrical form two inches 
in diameter ; cut into pieces three inches long, and roll these into rolls 
a little shorter than your oven grate, and one inch in diameter ; place 
them on the hot grate, just from the range or stove, and bake in an 
oven, not quite so hot as for " Gems," twelve to twenty minutes. 
Break into pieces three inches long for table. We think this the best 
and sweetest bread that can be made. 

Coarse or Graham Bread. — No. 1, or fine Graham flour, makes 
the best bread. The sponge is made at the same time, and in like 
manner to wheat bread, except the water used, which is ten degrees 
colder, as coarse flour rises quicker than fine. The same proportions 
of milk and water used. It is generally sweetened a little with sugar. 
When the sponge is added, make as stiff a batter as can be stirred 
conveniently. When light, mold into soft loaves. For this reason, 
it wants the hottest place in the oven. 

Rye Bread is made like wheat, with one exception — the loaves 
are made quite soft. As little flour as possible is used in molding. 

Corn or Brown Bread. — The sponge is made of unbolted rye or 
wheat. In the morning take four quarts of Indian meal, make a thin 
batter, using hot water. Let it stand half an hour to swell ; then 
pour in the sponge and one quart of molasses, three quarts of rye 
meal, or enough to make a stiff batter ; then put into covered dishes 
to rise. Bake three hours. 

Boiled Wheat. — Take good plump wheat ; pick it carefully, and 
wash clean ; soak over night in soft water, and boil in same water till 
softened through, whicli will require several hours. Rye or barley 
may be cooked in the same way. Serve with cream, sugar, and ripe 
fruit. 

Brown Bread. — Mrs. Susan Everett, M. D., sends the following 
from a lady who attended one of her courses of lectures. The author 
states that twenty-five years ago she attended a course of lectures on 
hygiene and the lessons she then learned have enabled her to keep la

good health ever since. She sent this recipe with a loaf of dehciouB 
brown bread to Mrs. Everett during her course of lectures at Perth 
Amboy, N. J. We regret that we are not permitted to give the lady's 
name : — " We make our own yeast from hops of our own raising. The 
vine makes a delightful shade for the south end of our back porch, 
and from that vine we gather, the last of August, hops enough for our 
own use during the year, and also for some of our friends. To three 
pints of water put a handful of hops, and boil tliem half an hour ; put 
into your yeast pot or jar six tablespoon fuls of flour and one teaspoon- 
f ul of salt ; set your jar near the kettle, and dip the hop tea into the 
jar through a sieve or colander. When you have strained enough to 
wet all the flour, stir it well, and then strain upon it the rest of the 
hop water. The mixture should be about the consistency of batter 
for griddle cakes. When it is cool, not cold, stir in a gill of good 
yeast ; set it in a warm place ; do not cover it close. When fermented, 
put it in a cool place, and cover close. This is the yeast from which 
we set our white bread at evening. The next morning we take a good 
handful of the dough; put it in a large yellow bowl, and add a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a half cup of molasses, a pint of lukewarm water, 
and enough Graham flour, making a dough softer than for white 
bread ; set it to rise and bake. We do not knead this bread. This 
makes two loaves. Brown bread is not improved by sugar." 

Anger's Method of Making Gems. — " To the Editor. — By your 
special request I will here state my experience in regard to the method 
of making the Graham gems. The flour is the principal ingredient, 
and on it depends chiefly the success of the baker ; it must necessarily 
be of the very best kind, made of the best winter wheat, and be pos- 
sessed of the qualities commonly known as " dry and strong." The 
treatment varies according to the qualities of the flour. If the flour is 
of the kind -described above, the dough can be baked immediately ; 
but if the flour be moist the dough must be allowed to stand in a warm 
place for at least four hours, in order to obtain a palatable article. The 
German hygienists allow the dough for their unleavened bread to 
stand six hours, in every case ; this is, however, unnecessary, provided 
the flour is of good quality. The next in order is a good baking oven, 
one that is capable of baking equally as well from the top as from the 
bottom ; it is difficult to state the exact amount of heating required, as 
some ovens are more easily heated than others ; suffice it to say that 
a quick oven is necessary, and that the glaring heat, which always ac- 
companies a freshly-heated oven, be allowed to pass away before bak- 
ing the gems, as they are very apt to blister on the top, especially the 
water gems. In mixing the dough take blood- warm milk or water, 
adding the flour and beating thoroughly for at least five minutes. It is 
better to retain some of the milk or water one intends to use, making 
the dough slightly tliicker, beat it well, and then add the remaining 
milk. By this method the dough becomes more thoroughly mixed, 
and is entirely freed of the small lumps that are so difficult to get rid 
of. If milk is used, make the dough thick enough, so that it can be 
spooned out comfortably ; but for water gems it must be made some- 
what thicker. 

" The pans used in baking the gems are of oval shape, measuring two 



212 RECIPES. 

and a half by one and a half inches ; eight of these unite in making 
one pan ; there are also some pans made of tin, but as the cast iron 
pan retains the heat longer it is the best. 

" If the dough is ready and the oven heated, then put some of the pans 
in the oven and allow them to become quite hot ; take one out, grease 
it with a clean rag dipped in butter, and drop the dough in the pan 
with a large spoon ; return the pan quickly to the oven. If the pan 
is too hot, so that when greased the butter is burned, allow it to cool 
before using it, as the gems will be apt to stick to the pan and be 
burned. After eight or ten minutes they must be looked after, and if 
they are getting too brown must be put in a cooler place and allowed 
to bake for another ten or fifteen minutes more. They ought not to 
be taken out before they are thoroughly baked, as they will become wet 
and doughy if taken out too soon, and no amount of after baking can undo 
this. They may be eaten hot with impunity, a quality not possessed 
by any other form of bread. 

"L. F. J. Anger." 

[We can testify from personal knowledge that Mr. Anger's gems 
are unsurpassed in delicacy and perfection by any we have ever 
tasted. — Ed.] 

Rusk. — Beat three eggs thoroughly, then beat in a cupful of sugar, 
and a little flavoring to the taste of lemon or nutmeg. Add a tumbler 
and a-half of rich cream which has first been mixed with a little flour ; 
use no more flour than will give it consistency enough to be molded. 
Let it rise all night or all day, and when very light put it upon tins to 
rise again before baking. Bake in a quick oven fifteen or twenty 
minutes. 

Tomato Custard. — This is said to be a beneficial diet for consump- 
tives. It is made by straining finely stewed tomatoes through a coarse 
sieve, and adding two pints of milk which has been scalded and cooled, 
and one pint of tomatoes, for four eggs , and one teaspoonf ul of sugar. 
Bake in small cups quickly. 

Cooking Raisins. — It is well to cook before putting them into pies, 
cakes, or puddings. Soaking is not sufiicient. Steaming them by 
pouring a small quantity of boiling water among them in a tightly 
closing dish, and allowing them plenty of time to cook before opening., 
is a good plan. When raisins are rightly cooked before using, they 
are plumper and more palatable, and can be eaten without injury by 
most dyspeptics. 

Tomato Pie. — Peel and slice ripe tomatoes and lay them on dishes 
as for apple pie. Sprinkle on a little flour ; and sugar to suit the 
taste. Bake with two crusts, in a moderate oven. This as well as 
green apple pie can be made with one crust only, by stewing the to- 
matoes or apples before putting into pies. 

Barley Pudding. — Prepare a half pound of pearl barley, one 
quart of new milk, and six ounces of sugar. Put the barley in fi-esh 
water, and let it steep twelve hours ; pour the water from it, add the 
milk, sugar, and a small salt-spoonful of salt, and bake it in a slow 
oven. If a richer pudding be required, take it out of the oven whea 



RECIPES. _ 213 

aearly done, stir in two ounces of butter, four well beaten eggs, a 
little flavoring, or any Buital)le seasoning ; return it to the oven in a 
buttered dish, and bake it one hour. 

Asparagus and Toast. — Asparagus, the best of the greens. Wash, 
pin up in a cloth, and boil gently in a little pure water about twenty 
minutes. It goes well with samp and potatoes, without condiments, 
but some people will not be content without dressing. The least ob- 
jectionable dressing is the white sauce — milk thickened with wheat- 
meal and slightly salted. " Asparagus toast" is made by cutting wheat- 
meal biscuit into thin slices, dipping in hot milk, spreading on a plat- 
ter, laying the boiled asparagus on it, and pouring over it the white 
sauce. "Asparagus peas" are prepared by just cutting into bits the 
tender part of the raw asparagus, boiling in just water enough to 
cover it until done, skimming out, dishing, and pouring over it the 
white sauce. 

Gravy for Children. — For a pint of gravy you want a large 
spoonful of flour, stirred smoothly into half a teacup of the cold milk. 
Let the milk be boiling when this is added, and kept constantly stir- 
ring, or the gravy will be lumpy. If cream is used instead of milk 
no butter is necessary. The milk should be stirred while coming to 
the boil to keep it from burning. It is less likely to burn if a little 
butter is melted in the spider before pouring in the milk. Add a little 
salt. For bread and potatoes it is better by far than meat gravy, and 
not only palatable and wholesome, but nutritious. 

Oatmeal Jelly. — A very delicate breakfast-dish can be made of 
" oatmeal jelly." Soak half a pint of good oatmeal over night in one 
and a half pints of water. In tlie morning drain off the water through 
a sieve, adding to it one and a half pints hot water, and put it to boil 
over a quick fire. Stir till it boils, then set it back and let it simmer 
ten minutes. Turn it into molds, and in fifteen minutes it will be 
set sufficiently to turn out into saucers, and will be warm enough to eat. 
Serve at once, without trimming, or with a little milk or sweet- 
ened fruit-juice. The soaked meal that is left can be utilized in 
batter-biscuit, or corn-meal mush, or made into a porridge by itself. 
In the latter shape it is bland, and peculiarly suitable for invalids who 
have not yet learned to like oatmeal. These preparations are in no 
way better than the whole oatmeal, excepting for variety. 

Tomato Soup. — Tc make one gallon, take three quarts of good beef 
stock ; one medium-sized carrot ; one medium-sized turnip : one beet ; 
one small onion. Peel and cut these up in small pieces ; then add 
three quarts of best fresh tomatoes, and boil for an hour. Strain 
through a sieve ; then put five ounces of butter in a saucer ; heat it 
to a light brown ; now, take it off the fire, and add, while hot, three 
table-spoonfuls of flour. Put in the boiled tomatoes, and season to 
your taste. Add one dessert-spoonful of sugar. Put it on the fire and 
Btir it till it boils. Let it boil for five minutes, skimming it the 
while. It is now ready for the table. More sugar and flour can be 
added, if necessary. 

Use for Cold Mush. — A good way to use cold mush of any kind 
either oatmeal, Graham, or Indian. After taking off the skin which 



214 EECIPES. 

forms, or any part which may be dry, mix a little milk with 
the mush to soften it ; then work in Graham or middlings till you can 
make the dough up into balls as large as a black walnut, and bake on 
the grate m a moderately quick oven. 

Boiled Rice. — Wash and drain off one pint of good new rice ; put 
into a covered saucepan with one quart of boiling water. Boil briskly 
for five or ten minutes, or until the water is mostly absorbed ; then 
set on one side of the stove, and let it steam steadily fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Keep closely covered all the time, and do not stir it at all 
after it begins to boil. The Southern people, who know both how to 
cook and to eat rice, never allow the lid to be removed while the steam- 
ing is going on ; perhaps just lifting one side of the cover to peep in, 
and see that it does not burn. When done just right, every grain will 
be swelled to its utmost, and bursted open. To be eaten as a veget- 
able, or with cream or maple syrup. 

Oatmeal Mush, — Julia Colman, who has charge of the cooking of 
the Hygienic Hotel, No. 13 & 15 Laight Street, New York, hands us 
the following method : 

" To three quarts of boiling water add one level teaspoonful of 
gait and one quart of good oatmeal, stirring while the latter is poured 
in slowly. Let it stand where it will boil gently, and stir it occasion- 
ally for ten minutes, or until the meal is evenly diffused through the 
water. Then cover close, and place where it will barely simmer for 
one hour. Do not stir it during that time. Serve warm, messing it 
as little as possible. 

Hygienic Plum Pudding. — This is from the Dietetic Reformer : 
" Put together in a basin some currants and sultana raisins that have 
been well washed and dried ; add wheat-meal flour in proportions pre- 
ferred., whether for a plain pudding or more fruit ; stir in gradually 
cold filtered rain-water, beating the mixture well ; make it the usual 
consistency of plum-pudding ; bake in a well-buttered dish, or boil 
several hours in a cloth. To suit some tastes, add a little sugar, 
candied peel, and grated lemon peel." 

A Delicious Cracker. — A delicious and wholesome cracker. — Take 
equal parts " middlings " and Graham flour. Wet with new or sweet 
milk, and knead rather stiff. Work it a good deal on the board ; then 
roll out to one quarter of an inch in thickness, and cut out in dia- 
monds or squares ; prick them, and bake in a quick oven. Bake best 
right on the grates. 

Mixed Gems. — Take a half-pint of corn-meal, pour boiling water 
upon it, enough to wet it ; then cool with skim-milk to the consistency 
of pancake batter ; and thicken with equal parts of "middlings" and 
Graham flour : to be baked the same as gems, only not so quickly. 

Quaker Mince Pies. — Chop fine a half-dozen of large bell-flowera 
or greenings ; add one cup of raisins, well cooked ; one cup of canned 
cherries, whortle-berries, or other fruit to suit the taste ; then a pinch 
of salt, and sugar or syrup enough to sweeten to the taste ; lastly, add 
a ijup of sweet cream when ready to use. Bake with cream crust.

Baked or Steamed Indian Pudding. — For one quart of sweet 
milk take a half-dozen large spoonfuls of best corn-meal ; wet it witU 
pyrup, and pour the milk over boiling hot — stirring it meanwhile. 
Chop fine three or four large sub-acid apples, and stir in : steam or 
bake three-quarters of an hour ; then beat an egg with a spoonful of 
sugar, and add a little milk, and stir in. 

New Way to Serve Egg Plant. — The vegetable egg we think 
has been undervalued, more on account of its improper preparation 
than for its demerit — the saturating it in butter and lard being the 
greatest objection. 

Wife has this season prepared as follows : Peel and then cut egg in 
slices or pieces ; add water enough to boil soft, and salt to suit 
taste. When soft pour off water and mash it ; make a batter of flour 
and eggs (chicken) ; mix the whole together, and bake like griddle- 
cake. When the proper quantities are mixed it will make a nice 
brown cake, with no grease (except to keep free from pan), and 
free from the strong wild taste which is generally disliked. We think 
the egg is destined to become a more general article of food, especially 
among hygienists. So oays 11. M. Engle. 

Maple Syrup. — This is the most delicious of the sweets. Every 
family should have some. If given to children on oatmeal or cracked 
wheat for breakfast every morning they would thrive like calves well 
fed with milk. To make a good maple syrup, melt with one pound of 
maple sugar two pounds of best white sugar. It will not do to use 
the brown, as this is not clean enough. 

Tomato Gravy. — Scald, peel, and cut very fine,'apintof good, 
ripe tomatoes ; put into a stewpan, with a pint of boiling water, and 
stew them one hour ; stir frequently to keep them free from the 
bottom, and to make them very smooth and fine. When they are 
stewed down to a pint, rub a large spoonful of Hour with a lump of 
butter the size of a walnut, and stir into the tomatoes ; stir thoroughly 
till they are cooked, then pour a pint of rich, sweet creajn into the 
middle of the thickened tomatoes, and let them become boiling hot be- 
fore you stir them ; then stir well together, and boil five minutes. Salt 
to taste. Cut a slice of brown bread, or split gems into four pieces, lay 
into a vegetable dish, and pour the tomatoes over them. This is very 
nice when, well cooked, and all the ingredients are sweet and fresh. 
Children who are fond of tomatoes like this modification of cream and 
gravy. 

Apple Pan Doody. — For a family of six persons use a two-quart 
tin or earthen pan. Use the best pie apples. Pare and slice the apples 
nicely. 1st. Place a layer of apples about an inch thick, season with 
a speck of salt and sugar. 2d, Put a layer of cracker crumbs half 
inch thick. Alternate a layer of apples and cracker crumbs until the 
pan is full. Bake one hour, and serve with cream or rich milk. — 
R. I. Greenings are the apples for pies and puddings. 

Baked Apples. — Select sound apples of one size — pippins or some 
Dther well-flavored apple — peel and core ; use a small knife with a 
narrow blade, and take out the core of the apple from the blossom

end — the core lies nearest to tliat part- -do not go throagh, but make 
a cup, into which put a teaspoonful of sugar ; set the apples close to- 
gether in a deep dish, add a teacupful of water, put into the oven and 
bake. Sweet apples prepared in the same manner are very nice. A 
lemon cut in very thin slices, and a slice laid on each apple may be a 
desirable flavoring. 

Boiled Pears. — Take hard pears, wash, and remove specks ; be 
sure that they are sound at the core ; put them into a fruit-kettle, 
cover them with water — at least a quart — and boil them slowly an 
hour ; then add a sufficient quantity of sugar to make a lively syrup ; 
boil half or three-quarters of an hour, and serve cold. 

Crushed Wheat. — This prepai'ation of wheat is not yet generally 
in use by those who are in favor of farinaceous food. The whole grain 
is " crushed " in such a manner as to retain all its particles quite 
together. Nothing is lost or sifted out. It is made from good white 
wheat, and is very clean, and well put up in packages. It cooks 
more readily than the cracked grain, has more gluten, and has all the 
sweetness and flavor of the wheat. I cook it just as I do oatmeal ; hav- 
ing a quart or two of boiling water on the fire, stir in two handf uls of 
the grain — all I can grasp — for each quart of water ; boil rapidly for 
twenty minutes, stirring frequently to prevent its adhering to the bot- 
tom of the kettle ; then let it simmer over a slow fire for ten minutes, 
covered tightly. I like it better when cool ; the gluten forms a jelly, 
and when molded makes a handsome dish for the table. To be eaten 
warm a little more grain must be added when you make it. It is de- 
licious and wholesome with cream, light fruits, and sugar. 

French Honey. — Break one pound of lump sugar into pieces, put it 
into a pan, and add the yolks of six eggs, and the v/hites of four, the 
juice of four lemons, and the grated rind of two., and three ounces of 
butter. Stir this mixture over a slow fire, until it becomes thick like 
honey. It will keep a year, put into a dry, cool place. This is nice for 
a variety of tarts or shells. 

Jellies. — Currants and grapes make the best and cheapest jelly for 
home use. Select large, ripe currants, fresh from the bushes as possi- 
ble, pick out all the leaves or old currants, let tlie clusters remain on 
the stems ; weigh six pounds of the fruit thus cleaned, put into a stone 
or earthen vessel, add a pint of fresh water, then take a wooden 
masher and crush the berries thoroughly. I have a strong, thin linen 
towel sewed firmly into a poke, into which I put a pint or so of the 
crushed berries, wring and squeeze them completely ; emptying and 
filling until all the juice is secured, of which there will be about five 
pints. To this juice add five pounds of best brown sugar, putting the 
whole into a porcelain kettle ever a good fire, stir slowly with a silver 
or wooden spoon, and let it boil fifteen or twenty minutes. By this 
time, if the fruit is fresh, there is no failure of the jelly. Then I put 
it up in pint size, self-sealing glass jars for common use. It is, I really 
think, as cheap, and far more delicious for meats, than cranberries, and 
as a relish of fruit. It costs about twenty-five cents a pint, or pound. 
The best brown sugar makes the richest jelly, and with more uniform 
Buccess. If you want a delicate color, and more acid jelly, use white

Bugar. Black currant jelly is considered very beneficial in diarrhoea, 
and other diseases of like nature. 

Grape Jam. — Slip the skins ofT from the pulps and put them into 
an earthen dish ; put the pulps into a porcelain kettle over the fire, 
cover them, and bring them to a boil, being careful not to burn th«f»ra ; 
boil and stir them till the pulps are broken and the seeds are separated ; 
remove from the fire, and let the seeds settle to the bottom of the ket- 
tle ; then pour ofE the juice or s-trai.i it through a colander, and pul 
back into the kettle ; add the pulps and their rveight in best brown 
sugar ; simmer slowly, stirring frequently for an hour ; put up as you 
would fruit in glass cans. If you cook it long enough to keep without 
being air-tight, the flavor of the grape will be spoiled. 

Plums and late Cherries are excellent fruits for jams, light preserv- 
ing, and canning. Both of these fruits retain their own delicious flavor 
better if the seeds are left in. They are particularly relishable with 
farinaceous food. 

Jam and Jelly.- -The fruit that comes from the vines or canes latest 
in the season makes the poorest jelly. If curnintshang long upon the 
bushes, they lose most of their jelly-making property. They need to 
be used as soon as possible after gathering. One wlio desires clear, 
fine-flavored jelly will not squeeze the jelly-bag if it be of loose 
material. Fine flannel is best for this purpose, and when this is used 
some pressure is allowable ; but we wish to strain the juice not only 
free from stems, skins, and seeds, but free from all fine particles. 

Raspberry Jam. — One pound of sugar to each pound of berries, 
and nearly a pint of currant juice. Put the sugar and berries tog iither 
in a pan over the fire, and with potato-masher, or wooden spoon, keep 
mashing and stirring them constantly to prevent burning. When they 
are well mashed, add the currant- juice, and boil briskly, still stirring 
it carefully. Just before it actually boils skim it well. Let it boil 
about three-quarters of an hour to bring it to the right consistency. It 
is best to put it up in cups, bowls, or fruit-jars, as it does not keep so 
well after being disturbed. Cover the cups with firm paper varnished 
with white of ef^g, and pressed closely around over the edges of the 
cups. Jam should be kept in a cool, dry place. 

Grape Jelly. — Put the grapes in a jelly-pan with a very little 
water; simmer on the fire till quite soft ; then strain through a col- 
ander or flannel bag; when the juice is all run out, measure, and allow 
fully one pound of loaf sugar to every pint of juice: boil till it 
jellies ; when it has boiled twenty minutes, try a little in a saucer. It 
should be watched for fear of boiling over. Common sugar may be 
used, but the jelly will not keep so long. 

Barberry Jelly. — Scald the berries on the stems, and squeeze 
them through a thin cloth or flannel. Take one pound of sugar to 
one pound of juice. Boil together half an hour. Try a spoonful of 
the juice in a teacup of ice- water ; if it sinks to the bottom in a solid 
form, the jelly has come — if not, boil a while longer. 

Barberri/ Jam is excellent if made by cooking and stirring with the 
berries a quantity of good sweet apples. Boil till the apples b-th 
thoroughly cooked and mixed, then can in glass cans.

tender, then cut in thin strips to resemble straw, and preserve in su- 
gar ; fill a deep dish half full of jelly or nice cold custard, put the 
eggs in and lay the straws, nest-like, around them. 

A NICE Strawberry Dessert. — A nice dessert is made by filling 
coffee-cups loosely with strawberries, and pouring over them Graham- 
flour mush ; or instead, thicken sweet boiling milk to a consistency 
which is thin enough to fill the interstices between the berries, and 
yet thick enough to be firm when cool. Turn out and serve up with 
cream and sugar. 

Eggs without Boiling. — Drop eggs into a sauce-pan of boiling 
water, which remove immediately from the fire. Let them remain in 
the hot water five minutes. 

Beans without Pork. — Some families seem not to know that 
baked beans are delicious without pork, if properly cooked and sea- 
soned. Boil a pot of beans until they are cooked thoroughly soft, take 
half for one day's bean-soup, and use the other half a few days later 
for baked beans. If the beans are old drop in a small lump or half- 
teaspoonful of soda. When this water boils, turn it off, and supply 
its place with clean boiling water. After the beans have boiled in 
this an hour, we change the water again — sometimes three times, but 
never after the beans have begun to come to pieces. Set them where 
they will not boil too hard, and cook them four or five hours, when 
they are well softened and separated. Then we stir into this soup 
salt, and a cup of cream if we have it ; if not, a tablespoonf ul or two 
of good butter. We take out half of the beans (if we have cooked 
enough for two meals) before seasoning the day's portion, and some- 
times thin what is left for soup with hot water, and then put in the 
cream and salt, and boil and stir it all together. When we bake the 
reserved portion, we pour it into a large baking-dish or dripping-pan, 
stir in a spoonful of salt and a cup of cream, or creamy milk, and bit 
of butter, and bake an hour. I cannot believe that any one who tries 
it would prefer " pork and beans " to this. The most common mis- 
take in cooking beans is to cook them too little . This is the cause of 
their flatulent tendency, and such result may be prevented by thor- 
ough cooking. The frequent changing of the water takes away th« 
strong flavor which is disagreeable to many.

Spinach "with Eggs. — Wash the spinach leaves in several waters, 
and keep in cold water until time to cook it. Then put in boiling 
water enough to cover it, and add a little salt. Cover the paa, and 
boil the spinach briskly until the leaves are tender ; they will sink 
when done. Then press the water out, cut the spinach fine, put it in 
the pan, season with butter, and serve hot. Have the eggs ready 
poached, lay them on the spinach, and mix well with it. This is a 
delicious dish, and seasonable in the spring of the year. 

Gem aj^d Cheese Sandwiches. — Toast good cheese lightly ; split. 
wheatmeal gems in halves, and spread between two halves, so as to 
come to the edges all round, a slice of the toasted cheese. It makes a 
wholesome and palatable lunch ; children are fond of it. Some ob- 
ject to toasted cheese. The principal objection to it is that it is gen- 
erally toasted too much. If toasted dry, it is as hard to digest as a 
very hard-boiled egg. Another objection is, that it is too often eaten 
as a dessert with rich pie and cake, instead of with the principal part 
of the meal. 



SIMPLE BEVERAGES FROM FRUITS. 

The juices of various fruits may be used with water and sugar for 
making most delicious and wholesome beverages. 

Put a gallon of water on to boil, cut up one pound of tart apples, 
each one into quarters, put them in the water, and boil them until 
they can be pulped ; pass the liquor through a cullender, boil it up 
again with half a pound of sugar, scum, and bottle for use, taking 
care not to cork the bottle, and keep it in a cool place: the apples may 
be eaten with sugar as a sauce. 

Another way.— Bake the apples first, then put them in a gallon 
pan, add the sugar, and pour boiling water over, let it get cold, pasa 
the liquor as above, and bottle. 

Apple Toast and Water. — A piece of bread, slowly toasted till it 
gets quite black, and added to the above, makes a very nice and re- 
freshing drink for invalids. 

Apple Barley Water. — A quarter of a pound of pearl barley 
Instead of toast added to the above, and boil for one hour, is also a 
very nice drink. 

Apple Rice Water. — Half a pound of rice, boiled in the above 
an til in pulp, passed through a cullender, and drunk when cold. 
All kinds of fruits may be done the same way. 
Pigs and French plums are excellent ; also raisins. 
A little ginger, where desired, may be used. 

For Spring Drink. — Rhubarb, in the same quantities, and done io 
the same way as apples, adding more sugar, is very cooling.

LEMONADES. 

Lemonade prom Preserved Lemon Juice. — Preserve your juica 
when lemons are plenty and cheap, by adding one pound of refined 
sugar to each pint of juice, stirring the mixture till dissolved, when 
it should be bottled. Put a teaspoonf ul of salad-oil on the top to keep 
out the air, then cork closely. When wanted for use, apply a bit of 
cotton to the oil to absorb it. To a goblet of water add sufficient of 
this juice to suit the taste. Every family should preserve lemon juice 
in this way for times of need. If hot lemonade is desired, use hot 
instead of cold water. 

Tea Lemonade. — To a cup of very weak cold tea add the juice of 
half a lemon. It makes a pleasant beverage for old people who use 
tea. It is not desirable for the young. 

Pineapple Lemonade. — Peel twelve fresh lemons very thinly, 
squeeze the juice from them ; strain out the seeds ; pour on the peel 
a little hot water ; let it stand a little while to infuse, covering closely. 
When cool, strain this water into the lemon-juice, adding a pound of 
loaf sugar. Put the whole into a decanter to be kept cool for present 
use. Use two tablespoonfuls for a glass of lemonade. To add to the 
delicacy of the beverage, add a slice of pineapple to each glass. To 
add to the appearance, add a thin slice of lemon. Cool, delicious, 
wholesome. 

Orange and Lemonade. — Peel one large fresh lemon and six fresh 
oranges. Cover the peel with boiling water, and let it infuse in a 
closely-covered dish. Boil one pound of sugar in a pint of water, till 
a syrup is formed, skimming off any impurities, strain the peel-water, 
add it to the syrup when cold, and add the juice strained, stir well, 
and add cold water till it makes a pleasant drink. These methods of 
making drinks are more troublesome than the common way, but the 
result in the end is more satisfactory. 

Common Lemonade. — Cut three large fresh lemons in very fine 
slices, taking out the pips. Add half a pound of white sugar and 
about two quarts of water. Bruise well together and stir, and it is 
ready for use. 

Hot Lemonade. — Hot lemonade is often desirable in winter, when 
the body has been exposed to cold and is chilly. It is made the same 
as cold lemonade, except by using hot instead of cold water. 

English Lemonade. — Pare a number of lemons, according to the 
quantity of drink you wish to make. Pour boiling water on one 
quarter of the peel, and let it infuse. Boil your sugar to the con- 
sistency of a rich syrup, adding the white of an egg whipt in. When 
it boils pour in a little cold water to stop it, then let it boil again, 
when the pan should be taken off to cool and settle, skimming off any 
scum that comes to the top. When settled, pour off the syrup into 
the peel water, now add the juice and as much water as is necessary 
to make a rich drink. Strain through a fine jelly bag.

Lemon Whey. — Boil as mucli milk as you require, squeeze a lemon, 
and add as much of the juice to the milk as will make it clear. Mix 
with hot water, and sweeten to taste. 

Lemon Water. — Cut a fresh lemon into very thin slices, put them 
in a pitcher, and pour on one pint of boiling water. Let it stand till 
cold, sweeten to taste, and use. 

Milk Lemonade to keep a day or two. — Pare twenty-four large 
fresh lemons as thin as possible ; put eight of the rinds into three 
quarts of hot but not boiling water, and let it stand three hours. Rub 
fine sugar on the rind of the others, to absorb the essence. Put it in a 
china bowl, and squeeze the j nice from the lemons over it, after which 
add a pound and a half of fine sugar. Now put the water to the 
above, and add three quarts of boiling milk. Mix and pour through 
a jelly bag. Use the day after made. 

SIMPLE DRINKS FROM VARIOUS SUBSTANCES. 

American Temperance Beverage. —Twelve lemons, one quart 
of ripe raspberries, one ripe pineapple, two pounds best refined sugar, 
three quarts of pure soft cold, but not iced, water. Peel the lemons 
very thin, squeeze the juice of all over the peel, let it stand a few 
hours, add the two pounds of refined sugar, mash the raspberries with 
half a pound of same sugar, cut the pineapple, after paring it, in 
very thin slices, and cover them with sugar. Strain the lemon-juice, 
crush the raspberries, press the pineapple, put the lemon-juice in a 
bowl, add the three quarts of water, add the crushed berries and pine- 
apple, stir all together till the sugar is dissolved and it is ready to 
serve. This makes a delicious beverage. 

Cranberry Drink. — Mash a tea-cupful of clean fresh cranberries 
in a cup of cold water. Boil a large spoonful of oatmeal and a slice 
of a lemon in two quarts of water ; add the cranberries and as much 
sugar as will sweeten to the taste. Boil for half an hour and strain. 

Egg Tea. — It is a common but injurious practice for women to take 
a cup of hot tea on an empty stomach when tired and exhausted. An 
egg broken into a weak cup of tea, well beaten and mixed with a 
glass of cold sweet milk, is much less injurious, and really nourish- 
ing. 

Tamarind Water. — Boil an ounce of tamarinds, three ounces of 
currants, and two ounces of stoned raisins in three quarts of water, 
until nearly a third has evaporated. 

Pure tamarind water is much used in fevers, and is considered a 
cool and refreshing beverage. It is made by dissolving the pulp in 
boiling water, straining and cooling, or it may be prepared with 
barley water and treated in the same way. 

Strawberry Drink. —Boil a pound of sugar in a pint of water till 
it makes a syrup. Add a pint of strawberry juice, and boil gently foi 
an hour. Cool, and bottle in well corked bottles for use. Add watel 
to >aste. It ia a delicious spring drink. 



SIMPLE BEVERAGES FROM FRUITS. 223 

A. very delicious drink may be made from canned strawberries, 
water, and sugar, for eaxly spring use. This fruit is rarely canned, 
but is the most wholesome of any for early spring use before other 
new fruit can be had. The acid acts favorably in clearing out the 
system, acting on liver and bowels. 

Blackberry Drink. — A delicious drink is made by stewing a pound 
of ripe blackberries in a quart of water, adding sufficient sugar to 
make the drink palatable, and pourinp: off the fluid. The berries 
may be eaten separately. An equally pleasant drink may be made by 
stewing dried blackberries, adding sugar to make it sufficiently sweet. 
The amount of water and sugar may be decided by the taste. 

Raspberry Drink. — Take fine red, ripe raspberries, crush them in 
a sieve, and press out the juice, to each pint of which add a pint of 
syrup made by boiling a pound of sugar in a pint of water, the scum 
being removed. When the syrup and juice are mixed, boil slowly for 
an hour, cool, bottle, cork, and seal. When wanted, dilute with water 
to the right consistency. A delicious drink is quickly and cheaply 
made by stewing dried raspberries in water, adding sugar to make the 
drink palatable. It can be made of fresh berries by crushing them in 
a bowl and adding water and sugar to taste. Children are generally 
fond of drinks made in this way, and the variety is almost endless. 

Cherry Drink. — Mash twelve or fifteen large sour cherries, stones 
and all, in a goblet, pour on water till the glass is two-thirds full ; 
add loaf-sugar sufficient to suit the taste. This is a cooling summer- 
beverage, and an excellent diuretic. Persons suffering with gravel in 
the bladder are often greatly relieved by this beverage, only it should 
be made very strong of cherry- juice for them. 

PLU>f Water. — Pour over half a pound of plums a quarter of an 
ounce of ginger (if approved), two quarts of water ; boil till pulped, 
strain, boil again, skim well, and bottle for use. Keep cool. 

Gooseberry Water.— Green gooseberries, served in the same 
way, make a good drink. The proportions are : gooseberries one 
pound ; water, one gallon ; ginger, one-half ounce ; sugar, three- 
fourths of a pound. 

Mixed Currantade. — Mash one pound of ripe red currants with 
half a pound of ripe red raspberries ; add a half pound of sugar and a 
gallon of cold water. Let it settle, and it is ready for use. If it is 
desirable to bottle it, strain. Dried currants and dried raspberries 
may be used, and so may currant jelly, if more convenient. 

Pure Currantade.— Press the juice from ripe currants, strain, 
add to each pint a pound of best white sugar ; add cold water to taste. 
It makes a delicious beverage. Dried currants may be used, and thus 
the drink made at any season of the year. 

A Cool Ginger Drink.— Ginger is used almost universally as an 
addition to many drinks. There are those who would not allow it in 
the stomach, still, as the root contains no essential oil, and is slightly 
warming and carminative, it is not particularly objectionable. Gen

erally it agrees well with most stomachs. The following receipt foi 
a mild ginger beer will not be amiss. 

To six gallons of pure soft water put eight pounds of loaf-sugar, 
the whites of three eggs, well beaten, and three ounces best ginger. 
Powder the ginger finely, and mix with a little water before adding it 
to the mass. Boil gently for three-fourths of an hour, removing mean- 
time the scum that rises to the surface. Let it cool, add the juice of 
three large lemons and a table-spoonful of yeast. Now put it in a 
cask and bung it very tightly, and let it stand for about ten days, 
when it will be fit to use. 

Rhubarb Tea. — Boil two pounds of rhubarb stalks well sliced, for 
an hour in a quart of water, strain into a pitcher, add the juice of one 
lemon, and sugar to taste after it Is cold. This makes a refreshing 
drink in the spring of the year. 

Apple Tea. — Peel, core, and quarter two pounds of apples, boil for 
half an hour in a quart of water, strain the liquor into a pitcher, add 
the juice of one leniou and loaf-sugar to taste. 

Dried Apple Barley Water. — Boil one pound of clean dried 
apples in one gallon of water for an hour. Boil a quarter of a pound 
of pearl barley one hour. Strain off the juice of the apples, add the 
barley water, put it into uncorked bottles, and keep for use in a cool 
place. 

Apple Water. — Cut some very tart apples fine, pour over them 
boiling water, and let them simmer gently for half an hour. Strain 
off the liquor and sweeten to taste. 

Fio Water. — Boil a quarter of a pound of best preserved figs with 
a half ounce of ginger in two quarts of water. When reduced to a 
pulp, strain off and bottle for use. 

Barley Water.— Boil half a tea-cupful of the very best pearl 
barley in a quart of water till it is smooth, then strain it off into a 
mug, add the juice of a large lemon and loaf-sugar to the taste. The 
barley water should be strained through muslin before adding the 
lemon juice. 

Toast and Water. — Fill a quart-pitcher with boiling water. Drop 
into it a slice of bread toasted very brown. Let it stand till cold. 
Remember, drop the bread in instead of pouring the water over it, 
otherwise it will be cloudy instead of clear and beautiful. 

Fruit Juices. — The juice of the apple and pear, says Mr. Knight, 
may be used to great advantage in preparing a beverage. He has fre- 
quently, he says, reduced it by boiling to the consistence of a weak 
jelly, in which state it has remained several years without the slightest 
apparent change, though intentionally exposed to variation of temper- 
ature. A large quantity of the inspissated juice would take up but 
little space, and the addition of a few spoonfuls to a quart of water 
would at any time form a delicious, wholesome, refreshing drink, free 
from all intoxicating properties. Its cheapness would be greatly in 
Its favor. On sea voyages it would be a great luxury. We suggest 
experiments with it in the field of domestic economy

Summer Beverages. — Take the genuine jelly of any fruit you like, 
dissolve it in water, sweeten to taste, and keep in a cool place ; or il 
you have the fresh fruit, currants, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, 
grapes, bruise them in water, strain and sweeten. Keep in a cool 
place, and use as needed. Such drinks on ice will keep for several 
days. 

Capillaire. — Take fourteen pounds of sugar, break into it six eggs 
with the shells. Stir into it gradually three quarts of water. Set 
it over the fire and boil it, t iking off the scum until only a light froth 
rises. Add one gill of onuige-tiower water, and two or three drops 
of vanilla ; strain through a jelly-bag, and when cold bottle it, cork- 
ing tightly. A wine glaps in a tumbler of water is very refreshing. 
You may add to it slices of lemon, pineapple, crushed currants, or 
strawberries, as suits the taste and season. 

Eau Sucre. — Water, with sufficient sugar to make it sweet, is a 
common beverage in France, and there considered very wholesome 
and refreshing. Ladies generally take it before bedtime. It may be 
useful in some cases, but should not be used too freely. 

Grape Drink.— This is one of the most delicious and refreshing 
irinks ever devised by thirsty mortals. It is made of nearly ripe 
(grapes pounded, loaf-sugar, and water. It is strained until it becomes 
3f the palest straw-colored amber, and then frozen. Delicious drinks 
nay be made from grapes by stewing with sugar and water. We 
leave the reader to use his or her own ingenuity in devising them, 
riie fermented juice of the grape bears no comparison with these 
^ure, simple, delicious beverages.

Cream Sherbet, — Put the yolk of six eggs and a dessert-spoonful 
>f orange-flower water into two quarts of cream. Boil it up once in a 
X)vered stew-pan, then strain it. Add three-fourths of a pound of 
ine loaf-sugar, and stir till dissolved. When cold set it in ice, or 
Ireeze same as ice cream. 

Lemon Sherbet. — Dissolve a pound and a half of loaf-sugar in a 
quart of water, take nine large lemons, wipe them clean, cut each in 
halves, squeeze them so as to get out both j nice and some of the es- 
sence of the peel, stir into it the sugared water, strain and freeze 
same as ice cream. 

Strawberry Sherbet. — Take one pound of best ripe strawberries, 
crush tliem to a smooth mass, then add three pints of water, the juice 
M one lemon, and a tablespoonful of orange-flower water. Let this 
stand three or four hours. Then put into another basin a pound of 
best refined sugar, stretch over it a cloth or napkin, and strain on the 
Sugar the berries, squeezing out the juice as much as possible. Stii 
until the sugar is dissolved, then strain again, and set in ice an houi 
before serving, in small tumblers. 



226 MILK. 



MILK. 



Milk is a liquid food in a mucli higher sense than water. A poun<i 
of new 30w's lullk contains : 

1. Six drachms or three-fourths of an ounce of sugar. 

2. Four drachms or half an ounce of butter. 

3. Six drachms or three-quarters of an ounce of cheese 

4. Two drachms or one quarter of an ounce of mineral salts. 

5. Thirteen and three-quarter ounces of water. 

Milk makes a most perfect food and drink for the infant. It is also a 
very important food for other than children, It is of great service to 
invalids and the convalescent. It is true there are some constitutions 
with which it does not agree. Where this is the case, the objection 
may generally be obviated by skimming off the cream before using it. 
Even skim milk is very nutritious ; it contains nearly all the valuable 
nourishment of new milk except the butter. 

A Milk Diet. — Within a few years a milk diet has become a very 
popular prescription among physicians, they ordering patients to sub- 
sist on it for days or weeks at a time. In cases where the patient 
needs a good sustaining food without the risk of inflammatory action or 
excitement succeeding its use, a milk diet is perhaps the best regimen 
that can be chosen. This is especially true in all diseases affecting 
the respiratory organs, inflammations of the stomach, bowels, kidneys, 
and bladder. It is of benefit in cases of hemorrhage, and gout, and 
diarrhoea. In fevers it is much used. In convalescence from small- 
pox, scarlet fever, measles, typhoid fever, milk is often very service- 
able. I have found gems and milk very excellent after scarlet fever. 
Indeed, good home-made brown bread and milk is almost a perfect 
food, especially for feeble children suffering with scrofulous habit of 
body, mesenteric diseases, spinal affections, fits, taint of the blood. I 
even go so far as to say that all children would be the better for tak- 
ing one meal of brown bread and milk daily, and feeble ones should 
use it three times a day. 

In ulceration of the stomach or bowels, milk is very serviceable. 
The case reported in the Herald of Health for August, 1873, of Mrs. 
Sara B. Ciase, is in point. After nearly two years' suffering of untold 
agony from ulceration of the stomach, she was cured by a milk diet. 
She began by taking a teaspoonful every hour, and adhering to it 
alone for nearly a year, except the amount was increased as the 
strength returned. The greatest fear is in taking more than the 
stomach in its weakened condition can manage. I commend a study 
of this case to all suffering from ulceration or cancer of the stomach. 

In diabetes an exclusive milk diet has been found to work wonders. 
It must be persevered in methodically and exclusively until conva- 
lescence is established. It is well known that in this ugly disease the 
great danger is that the starch of the food is converted into sugar, 
and as such passes out of the system without yielding any of its force 
to the body. Dr. Arthur Scott Duncan, of England, says, " the ra- 
pidity with wliich milk acts is truly surprising. Twenty- four houn

bfting sufficient to produce a marked change, the quantity and density 
of the urine suddenly falling, thirst and appetite disappearing, the 
skin becoming moist and perspiring, sleep improving." Dr. Karell 
reports two hundred cases treated by milk alon«, among which were 
many remarkable cures. 

For the aged, mil}c, or bread and milk, offers advantages worthy of 
their serious attention. The great Professor Black adopted it for 
many years before his death, because he thought it ought to be the 
natural food of an aged man in his second childhood. He died with a 
bowl of milk in his liand, so quietly that not a drop was spilled. 

Dr. George W. Balfour has found an exclusive milk diet to be very 
beneficial in asthma after it had resisted other means of cure for 
years. 

Boiled milk is digested in two hours ; raw milk in two hours and a 
quarter. 

Choice of Milk. — Cow's milk differs greatly in quality, some being 
rich and other thin and watery. In choosing a family cow it is well 
to bear this in mind, and to select only those that are healthy and 
give the very best milk. They should also be fed on the best of food, 
and allowed pure soft water to drink. The practice of feeding cows 
on garbage, swill slops, distillery feed, and of keeping them confined 
in close, filthy, unventilated stables, is one which seriously deterio- 
rates the milk, and should ever be avoided. 

Those who live in cities cannot of course keep cows, and so they 
must depend on the market for their supply of milk. In large cities 
such cannot do better than to use condensed milk, if they can get it. 
It has been used in our institution for many years with very satis- 
factory results. In preparing it the animal odor is evaporated, and it 
can be made as rich as is desired. It may be diluted for babes if 
necessary. Of course we do not speak of the condensed milk put up 
in cans, but that prepared for supplying the market for immediate 
use. 

If condensed milk cannot be obtained, and you cannot keep your 
own cow, then insist on having the best article, and refuse to use that 
from distillery-fed cows, or that diluted with water. A little atten- 
tion to this subject will enable any one to secure a good article. It is 
the laxity of purchasers of food in not demanding the best that makes it 
Bo easy for the dealer to palm off adulterated and inferior articles upon 
thoughtless people. If the poor would do this, it would improve their 
own and their children's health wonderfully. The milk supply of a 
city has a great deal of influence for good or evil on the health of the 
children. In England, this question is getting to be a very important 
one. The Food Journal says that " perhaps the most serious and 
destructive change in the nutrition of the poor is their almost total 
privation of milk. Infantile sickness and mortality depend largely on 
tbis want." There the occupation of mothers in factories and work. 
«hops deprives many thousands of infants of their natural food- 
breast milk. 

Preparing Cow's Milk for Babes. — In this connection I wish ie 
give explicit directions for preparing artificial human milk for babes 



228 MILK. 

It is well known that cow's milk is far riclier than human milk. It 
contains more curd, more cream, more mineral matter, and less water. 
Compare the following table with the one at the beginning of thia 
paper. One pound of human milk contains : 

Sugar 4 drachms and 40 grains. 

Butter 3 " ** 30 ** 

Curd 3 " '* 30 " 

Mineral salts 41 " 

Water 14 ounces and 41 " 

It may not be well known why cow's milk so often disagrees with 
babes. A principal reason is that in the stomach the curd forms in 
harder lumps and is not easily acted on by the gastric juice, whereas 
human milk forms a flocculent soft curd which readily absorbs the 
gastric juice, and is acted on by it with great ease. 

The question is how to modify cow's milk to make it suitable for a 
new-born infant ; it having been found to disagree in its pure state. 

There is in the first place too much casein, or cheese, in cow's milk, 
and the child cannot digest it ; to reduce it to the true proportion, 
nearly twice as much water as milk is necessary ; to be exact, it must 
be eighteen parts of water to ten parts of milk ; but this would reduce 
the quantity of butter also, without which the child would not thrive. 
The milk to be diluted must therefore contain more butter than ordi- 
nary milk, which must be obtained by setting aside, say, three quarts 
of milk, and at the end of four or five hours remove the upper quart ; 
the upper third of any quantity of milk containing fifty per cent, more 
butter than the ordinary milk of the cow. The same result can be 
obtained by taking the " strippings," or latter part of the cow's milk- 
ing. This milk, when diluted with one and a half parts water, and 
properly sweetened, resembles ordinary human milk. 

Various Dilutions for various Ages. — Mother's milk for new- 
born babes is so peculiar as to have got a special name, colostrum. It 
gradually loses these peculiarities. For colostrum, or milk prepared 
for the first two weeks of a child's life, must contain more butter — the 
upper eighth, instead of the upper third, must be used. From two 
quarts of milk, which has stood four or five hours, skim off carefully 
half a pint ; or the last tenth of milk just stripped from a cow. For 
example, if a cow gives five quarts, the last pint may be used. This 
milk must be largely diluted with water, according to the following 
schedule.

Regulations op the Quality of the Milk. — If the milk be too 
strong, indigestion will follow, and the child will lose instead of gain- 
ing strength. When particles of casein, or curd, pass through his 
bowels unaltered, a milder quality or lower grade should be substitu- 
ted. A feeble child of six months may require the food suited to a 
vigorous child of six months. For constipation, increase the richness 
of the milk, put in more cream. In cold weather, or if milk is kept 
on ice, it may stand an hour or two longer before the upper third is 
removed ; or the upper fourth maybe taken; or set five quarts instead 
of three to get one quart. 

The water used in diluting milk should not be hard ; nor should it 
be boiled. Add it to the milk, and heat it by putting the bottle in 
Warm water. 

SwEETENLNQ. — Use loaf sugar enough to make it as sweet as un- 
tliluted new milk, a teaspoonful to a quart. If too sweet, it will cloy 
the appetite, and not enough food will be taken. 

Temperature. — The milk should be heated to one hundred de- 
grees Falirenheit ; test it once, and try it on the cheek ; which should 
regulate it subsequently. 

Quantity. — For the first ten days, about one to one and a half 
pints a day should be given ; before the end of the first month the 
child will take more than a quart daily ; at the age of three months 
he may require two quarts daily. After that time the quality will 
change more than the quantity. The child will need half a pint at 
a time every three or four hours, which should be sucked in about 
ten minutes, and he will pass six or eight hours at night without 
feeding. 

The bottles should be annealed by being put into cold water and 
boiled three or four hours, and the most scrupulous care observed in 
cleaning them. 

We have made out a scale of dilutions for one year, but the mothei 
may, after the child is six months old, find it necessary to use more 



230 MILK. 

milk and less water, in which case she will dilute less. If the child 
manifests symptoms of malnutrition on this food, it is evident that its 
food should be rendered more nourishing. We are indebted to Dr. 
Corson for the demonstration of the practical utility of beginning our 
trials with pure cow's milk, since the principal inconvenience which is 
found to occur is the regurgitation of a part of it ; while, on the other 
hand, the infant runs the risk of starvation, or at least of numerous 
diseases, before any notice is taken of the deficiently nutritious 
quality of milk and water. If he succeeds in his object " of directing 
attention to the fact that many thousands of children annually die 
prematurely from want of food," he will have accomplished a great 
work ; but if he proposes to give all children pure cow's milk, with- 
out reference to its agreement or disagreement with their stomachs, 
he will have fallen into the same error with those who confide ex- 
clusively in milk and water. 

Oatmeal Milk. — I cannot help in this connection printing the fol- 
lowing letter from one of my correspondents, regarding oatmeal milk 
for young children ; which I am sure will help some mother to rear 
to health a child when she might otherwise fail. I may add, however, 
that it should not be used before the babe is three or four months 
old, and then a gradual substitute for the breast. She says : 

" When my baby was five months old, for the sake of my own 
health, I weaned him from the breast. I gave him cream and water, 
with a little sugar. In two weeks' time his bowels were so consti- 
pated that I fully realized that some change must be made in the 
food. I, therefore, made oatmeal gruel by boiling oatmeal in about 
twice the usual quantity of water for an hour and a half or two 
hours. When properly cooked, I poured it through a fine sieve. The 
part which passed through was, when cold, of the consistency of jelly. 
Then, in a quart cup, I mixed one half pint of thin cream and oatmeal 
gruel — about one gill of each — added one teaspoonf ul of white sugar, 
and filled the measure nearly full of boiling water. This food he 
relished, and in every way it agreed with him ; and if there ever was 
a child that grew any faster than mine did when fed with oatmeal and 
milk, I think it would be a wonder. People would say : ' How your 
baby grows,' and in the same breath (when I told what his food was), 
would say : ' Why, you'll starve him I ' But by putting in less water 
I found it was too hearty, causing him to vomit ; and once in possession 
of the key to my child's health nothing turned me aside. 

** My child is now a year and a half old, his food is three parts milk 
and one part gruel. He is very large, strong and active, has twelve 
teeth, weighs thirty pounds, and in all the time has not lost an ounc<j 
of flesh, even at the most trying time — warm weather. 

" That I am enthusiastic in regard to oatmeal milk should not seem 
strange, and I wish that, of the many mothers throughout the land, 
those who find it necessary to provide other than the natural food foi 
their children would try my recipe, They would find doctors' visits 
few and far between." 

Recipe for Gruel,' — One teacup oatmeal, two quarts of liot water 
Boil two and a half hours. Strain through a fine sieve. 



MILK. 231 

1 prefer this way to the phin of soaking the oatmeal in cold water, 
•rhich I have tried, but find that the taste is not so pleasant. 

Sktmbted Milk. — Skimmed milk, according to analysis, la not 
greatly inferior to new milk, except in the amount of butter it con- 
tains ; as will be seen from the following : 

100 parts new milk — water, 86 ; nitrogenous, 5.5 ; sugar, 3.8 ; fat 
3.6 ; salts, 0.66. 100 parts skimmed milk — water, 88 ; nitrogenous, 
4.0 ; sugar, 3.8 ; fat, 1.8 ; salts, 0.8. 

The effect on Dr. Smith of eating one pint of new milk was to 
increase the exhalation of carbonic acid 2.26 grains per minute. It 
also gave an increase of air inhaled of 96 cubic inches in one min- 
ute ; skimmed milk, on the other hand, gave an increase to carbonic 
acid exhaled of 84 grains per minute and 21 cubic inches in the in- 
spired air. Much is said in these days regarding the food qualities 
of alcoholic drinks, but Dr. Edward Smith, in his experiments on the 
best brandy as food, found that instead of an increase of vital ac- 
tion by the exhalation of more carbonic acid and tlie inhalation of 
more air, that there was a diminution of both. In other words, vital 
action was diminished instead of increased, and this was the result 
with nearly all the alcoholic drinks tested. And in those cases where 
vital action seemed increased, it was in a very slight degree, not 
one-fifth so much as shown above in the use of milk. Ten grains 
of milk consumed in the body produces heat sufficient to raise 1.7 lb. 
of water 1° F., and this is equal to raising 1.246 lb. one foot high. 
Can alcohol consumed in the body do this? 

Cautions Reqardixq the Use op Milk. — While good milk is 
an excellent article of food for the young, the aged, and many in- 
valids, it may be the means of spreading dangerous diseases. That 
which is sent to cities may have received infection frmn the air of the 
dairy-house, and in this way scarlet and typhoid fevers sometimes 
be propagated. But a greater source of danger is in the water that 
the dairyman mixes with it. If the water is pure, of course the in- 
jury lies only in the less amount of nourishment it contains ; but if 
water is used from wells or springs not pure, then the danger is very 
great. In England numerous instances have come to light where a 
large number of families supplied by the same milkman have had 
typhoid fever, and on careful investigation it was found that the 
dairyman had in these cases watered his milk from a well-pump in the 
yard, into which there was a slight leakage from a drain. Through 
this leak had oozed the poisonous germs that poisoned the milk, and 
carried that most dangerous malady into forty-seven families, destroying 
one hundred and sixty-five persons. Thanks to the spirit of investiga- 
tion which sought and found the source of the contagion. Still an- 
other source of danger in the use of milk is where the child is nursed 
by a diseased mother, or one subject to fits of passion, or where the 
mother has been poisoned by food or medicine. We mention these 
things that all may be on their guard, and be able to avoid causes oi 
disease that lurk in unsuspected and hidden places. 

Cream. — Cream is a liquid food of great richness, especially in fat, 
and pure would be too hearty to be used as a food to any great extent j 



232 TEA. 

but mixed with milk it forms a very agreeable, even delicious drink, 
and for persons thin in flesh and run down in health it may often 
serve important uses, especially if it agrees with the stomach. Pur» 
cream contains, 

Water 66.00 parts 



Nitrogenous 2.7 



Sugar 2.8 parts 

Fat 26.7 " 



A mixture of cream and milk and oatmeal forms a very nourishing 
diet for consumptives, and those with little animal heat, also for those 
who use little or no animal food. 

Buttermilk.— This liquid food is not much used by Americans, but 
the Germans regard it with great favor. It contains about as much 
nourishment as skim milk. It is poor in heat-giving qualities, but 
there is considerable nitrogenous matter in it. Here is the analysis : 



Water 88.0 

Nitrogenous 4.1 



Sugar 3.6 

Fat.. 0.7 

Salts 6.8 

It also contains lactic acid, which is believed to favor digestion. In 
some forms of disease a buttermilk diet is found to be serviceable. 
It is better adapted to the fat than the lean, and to those who have a 
superabundance of animal heat than to those who suffer with cold feet 
and hands and languid circulation. 

TEA. 

So much has been written on the use of tea, pro and con, that 
little new can be said. Nevertheless there are some points concern- 
ing this question not yet well understood. They are as follows : 

1. Tea is not nutritious. The milk and sugar put into the cup to 
give it flavor has a real value as a food. 

3. Nearly all teas, whatever their price or name, are about of equal 
value so far as their physiological effects are concerned. The higher 
priced sorts have, however, a much more delicate flavor, and for this 
reason will always be preferred. 

3. That tea should, when used, be weighed rather than measured, 
as some kinds weigh more to the teaspoonful than others. Oolong, 
for instance, weighs 40 grains to the teaspoonful, Congou weighs 87, 
and gunpowder tea weighs 125 grains to the teaspoonful. 

Then, too, the effects of tea are not well understood. 

1. Tea increases the amount of carbonic acid expired from the 
lungs. 

2. It increases the volume of air inspired, but not the rapidity of 
respiration, consequently it must increase the depth of inflation of 
the lungs. 

3. Tea tends to induce perspiration, especially if taken hot. 

4. Tea excites to increased action the muscular system. 

5. Tea powerfully excites the nervous system. 

The points last enumerated accord with the experience of a ma- 
jority of tea-drinkers, and if the subject were dropped here, the im- 
pression would be very favorable to the use of this beverage. There 
B, however, another side to be considered. It has been found that 



TEA. 233 

tea is not nutritious, and that it actually increases the waste of the 
system. From this it may be inferred that tea is not a good drink for 
those who are dyspeptic and nervous, or those in which the waste of 
tissue is already more rapid than the supply. Dr. Edward Smith puts 
it in this way : " Tea increases waste, since it promotes the transfor- 
mation of food without supplying any nutriment, and increases the 
loss of heat without supplying fuel. It is, therefore, specially adapted 
to those who eat too much, when the process of assimilation should be 
quickened, but is less adapted to the poor, the ill-fed, and during 
fasting." 

Dr. Smith also gives the following as the generally admitted effects 
of tea : 

1. A sense of wakefulness. 

2. Clearness of mind and activity of thought and imagination. 
8. Increased disposition to make exertion. 

4. Reaction, with a sense of exhaustion following the preceding 
effects and in proportion to them. 

Analysis op Tea. — The active principle of tea is a substance called 
theine. One hundred parts of tea contain : 



Theine 2.00 

Casein 15.00 

Gum 18.00 

Sugar 3.00 

Tannin 26.25 



Starch 0.75 

Fat 4.00 

Vegetable fiber 20.00

Water 5.00 



The amount of theine varies from two to six per cent. The chemical 
formula for theine is C". H»". N*. 0.«-i-H''0. 

Practical Hints Concerning the Use of Tea. — The following 
hints concerning the use of tea may prove useful : 

1. Whoever uses tea should do so in great moderation. 

2. It should form a part of the meal, but never be taken before eat- 
ing, or between meals, or on an empty stomach, as is too frequently 
done. 

3. The best time to take tea is after a hearty meal. 

4. Those who suffer with weak nerves should never take it at all. 

5. Those who are troubled with inability to sleep nights should not 
use tea, or if they do, take it only in the morning. 

6. Brain- workers should never goad on their brains to overwork 
on the stimulus of tea. 

7. Children and the young should not use tea. 

3. The overworked and under-fed should not use tea. 

9. Tea should never be drunk very strong. 

10. It is better with considerable milk and sugar. 

11. Its use should at once be abandoned when harm comes from it. 

12. Multitudes of diseases come from the excessive use of tea, and 
for this reason those who cannot use it without going to excess should 
not use it at all. 

Tea and Sick Headache. — The following, from the Medical Invea- 
tigator, has an important bearing on the use of tea : " Dr. Gregg pub- 
lished an article in the Homceapathic Quarterly on tea, as a cause of 



234 TEA. 

sick lieadache, worthy of the attentioji of those who suffer with thift 
common malady. The doctor there alleges that this beverage is the 
cause of more cases of this disease than any other, if not than all otliei 
causes put together, and gives a number of instances where, after 
leaving off its use, persons who had previously been afflicted were 
exempt from further attacks. One evidence the doctor gives of the 
injurious effects of this agent is the fact that tea-drinkers are liable 
to have lieadache if they omit its use at the regular times of taking it, 
and the cessation of the pain on again resuming their cups. This 
latter, with many other facts contained in the article, have often been 
observed, not only on myself, but on others, for I had inherited the 
disease from my mother. It had been the plague of her life, as well 
as my own. We had both been not excessive but regular tea-drinkers ; 
and though she lived to be over eighty years of age, she was never 
exempt from an attack, of greater or less severity, for more than a 
few weeks at a time, for a period of nearly or quite half a century. 
Knowing this fact, and that from my earliest recollection I had been 
similarly afflicted, I was content, when the pain returned, to relieve it 
with the appropriate remedies, with little thought or hope of ever being 
able to eradicate it. Some twenty years ago I had abandoned the use of 
coffee and green teas, using only the black and Japan, Pork, pastry, 
spices, acids, and most kinds of raw fruits were sure, if indulged in, 
to bring on an attack of my old trouble ; and this weakness of the 
stomach seemed to be gradually on the increase, besides a train of 
nervous symptoms, such as sleeplessness, palpitation of the heart, un- 
steadiness of the hand when writing, etc., gave me no little annoyance. 
After reading the article referred to, I concluded, some three months 
ago, to use no more tea, substituting in its stead hot water with a little 
milk. The result, for the first week or ten days, was much as I 
had anticipated, being, during the whole of that time, scarcely ever 
free from headache. At length the pain became lighter, and when it 
did return was of short duration. My nervous symptoms grew less, 
palpitation left entirely, my stomach became much stronger. I can 
now eat with impunity many things which for years had been sure to 
disagree. The headache now very rarely returns, and never with 
severity ; besides, within the past two months my weight has increased 
sixteen pounds." 

Tea and Dyspepsia. — Where there is any tendency to dyspepsia, 
tea aggravates it, and many cases are cured by disusing it. Dr. Corfe 
mentions a cure of supposed cancer of the stomach, cured by the disuse 
of tea. Dr. Milligan mentions a person who could never use tea with- 
out experiencing a disposition to commit suicide. 

Tea-Druitkaiids. — In closing what is to be said about tea, one word 
Beems necessary in regard to tea-drunkards. Their number is legion ; 
they are of both sexes, but more of women than of men. Instead of 
using tea in moderation, or as an occasional beverage, they swill it 
down three or more times a day, in quantities that are incompatible 
with health. They are as much slaves to the teapot as the drunkard 
is to his bottle. They are tea-drunkards. Tea, in anything but great 
moderation, is a poison capable of ruining the stomach, enfeebling and

disordering the heart's action, shattering the nerves, and ruining the 
health and happiness of the victim. In few words, without holding 
that the use of tea is as bad as the use of alcoholic liquors, one may 
well believe that the total abstinence reformers have, in their red-hot 
seal against rum, encouraged an indulgence in tea-drinking which will 
one day have to be fought against with might and main, to prevent 
the wholesale ruin of multitudes. A tea-drunkard may be defined aa 
one who drinks strong tea several times a day, who depends on it 
instead of food and rest for strength, and who cannot go without it 
without bringing on distressing symptoms. 

COFFEE. 

The active principal of coffee is called caffeine. An analysis of ont 
hundred parts of raw coffee shows the following to be its composition : 



Caffeine 1.00 

Casein 13.00 

Gum and sugar 55.05 

Fat 13.00 



Mineral matter 6.07 

Acids 5.00 

Wood fiber 34.00 

Water 12.00 



Caffeine is analogous to theine in composition and effects. 

Coffee produces effects very similar to tea, and the same general 
rules are applicable for its use. It, like tea, powerfully affects the 
respiration, increasing the quantity of carbonic acid expired and air 
inspired. Coffee differs from tea in its effects by increasing the rate 
of respiration and not its depth, in increasing the rate of pulsation, 
and in diminishing the action of the skin. Those who suffer with dry 
skin, or palpitation of the heart, or heart disease, are particularly 
liable to harm from the continued use of coffee in large quantities. It 
is more suited to the wants of the poor and debilitated than tea, and 
is more appropriate for the breakfast meal than afterwards. 

COCOA AND CHOCOLATE 

Cocoa and chocolate have, for their active principle, the obromine, a 
substance very similar to caffeine and theine. The formula for theo> 
bromine is C H«. N*. O^. 

The analysis of the cacao bean gives in 100 parts : 



Theobromine 0.56 

Cacao 6.61 

Cacao butter 36.97 

Gluten 3.20 

Starch 0.55 

Gum 0.69 



Extractive matter. .... 4.14 

Humic acid 7.25 

Woody Matter 30.00 

Salts 3.00 

Water 6.01 



Dr. Edward Smith, to whose work we are largely indebted for out 
knowledge of tea, coffee, and cocoa, says of the latter substance : ** Its 
action is less exciting to the nervous system than tea or coffee, and at 
the same time it contains a much larger portion of nutritive material. 
Boiled in milk, it may produce a most agreeable and nutritious food, 
and for very many persons is greatly to be preferred t > tea or coffee.* 



236 COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

Methods of Preparing Tea, Coffee, and Cocoa. 

Tea. — The tlieine of tea is without flavor. This depends on the 
aroma, which sliould all be extracted from the leaf. The dried juices 
of the leaf, on the other hand, should not be extracted further 
than to give body to the drink, otherwise it will be bitter and the 
aroma will be covered up or hidden. The best rule to secure the aroma 
and not too much of the body is to put the tea into hot water, and 
keep it at or near the boiling point for five minutes. If cooked longer 
than this the aroma will be dissipated, more theine will be extracted 
and the tannin, which makes tea bitter, will be in excess. The best 
water for tea is pure spring-water. It should be fresh and used im- 
mediately after boiling. After the tea is cooked it should be strained 
and kept hot till used. 

Coffee. — Soyer's mode of making coffee was to warm the powder 
over the fire first, then to pour the boiling water over it ; cover it closely 
for five minutes, strain it, and boil again for use. French coffee is 
made by adding a pint of made coffee to a pint of boiling milk and 
warming them both together, but not letting them boil too long. 

Chocolate. — Cut a cake of chocolate in very small pieces, boil a 
pint of water, when it is at the boiling point add the chocolate ; mill 
it off the fire till quite melted, then place it on a gentle fire till it 
boils. Pour into a basin and it will keep for teu days. When required, 
put a spoonful or two into fresh milk. b;>il it with sugar and mix well. 
Mill to a fine froth and se\ «• 

Cocoa. — It made from the ribs, boil a quarter of a pound of them 
in three quarts of water to two quarts and a half. The ribs to be 
strained after five hours' boiling. If made from paste or powder, use 
one and a half teaspoonf ul of cocoa to a cup of boiling milk. Sugar 
to taste. Or one and a half teaspoonf ul of cocoa, three quarters of 
a cupful of boiling water. Sugar to taste and fill the cup with 
milk. 

Conclusion. 

Some hygienists will find much fault that we have not condemned 
entirely the use of tea and coffee, but though we never use them our- 
selves, we have thought best to give the results of late scientific stud- 
ies on the subject, and such cautions regarding their use as will enable 
those who do use them to do so with as little harm as possible. If 
asked what is the proper amount of these drinks for each day, we 
should say, do not exceed one cup of tea or coffee, and at farthest two 
of cocoa or chocolate.
