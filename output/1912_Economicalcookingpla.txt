This little book aims to be both instructive and suggestive. 
The principles of right feeding, economy, and cooking are set 
forth, with a variety of recipes and menus, and it is hoped 
that the general public will be interested in these important 
subjects. 

The book is planned for housekeepers who wish to begin 
simply, but the importance of attractive food and service is 
insisted upon as bearing directly on the health of the family. 

The recipes are planned for two persons, with the idea that 
they may be quite easily adapted to a larger number. 

These rules have all been tested, and many of them are 
family favorites. 

Thanks are due to my assistant, Helen E. Smith, for effi- 
cient help in the preparation of this book, and to Mrs. Mary 
Hinman Abel and Miss Minnie M. Smith, for permission to 
use recipes from their writings. Also for quotations made 
from Miss Anna Barrows' " Rules for Cooking Fish."

PART I.— INTRODUCTION 



FOOD VALUES 

Everyone wishes to get the best possible results from time 
and effort put into daily work. 

It is equally important to make each penny expended for 
food bring in as much strength as possible. 

A practical knowledge of food values fits the housekeeper 
to really " feed " her family — that is, to see that tired mus- 
cles are built up, overwrought nerves calmed, and all forms 
of bodily weakness overcome. 

The busy housewife need not plunge deeply into chemistry, 
but she should learn the few great classes of food, and what 
each does for the building up of the body. 

We may temporarily overcome " hunger " by eating a quan- 
tity of bulky food such as potatoes, when really our bodies 

^ x ave not been fed properly at all. 

\ 

What Every Housewife Should Remember 

We depend on food to build up the strength used in daily 
life. 

If we let stimulants take the place of food, we use up 
strength faster than we can make it, as stimulants give only 
a false strength. 

Food is necessary for warmth. 

A mixed diet is best suited to all persons. This means : 

Bread and butter. Cereals. Rice or potatoes. Vegetables and 
fruits. Meat, eggs, or milk. Sweets. 

13 



14 Economical Cooking 

Children's stomachs have not " grown up," so to speak, and 
we must not expect them to do the same work — that is, digest 
the same kind of food as adults. 

The constitution of everyone is largely influenced by the 
kind of food eaten during childhood. 

In the treatment of disease, most modern physicians con- 
sider that proper diet is more important than medicine. 

Glasses of Food 
For convenience, foods are divided as follows: 

1. Proteids — strength-giving foods, to give muscular en- 
durance. 

Meat. Milk. Eggs. 

2. Fats, to give flesh and heat. 

Fat of meat. Butter. Cream. Oils. Oily parts of nuts. 

3. Sugars and starchy food, to give endurance and flesh. 

Sugar. Molasses. Breads. Cereals. 

4. Vegetables and fruits, to harden the bones, to purify 
the blood and to keep the blood in good order. 

5. Water. This is food as well as drink, for it helps to 
keep the body from wasting away, and it also cleanses the en- 
tire system. 

We need equal parts of strength foods and fat, and about 
tli r re times as much of the bulky, starchy foods, such as 
cereals and bread. 

To sum up, a " well-fed " person is one whose food contains 
materials for keeping him warm, for building muscle, for mak- 
ing flesh, for keeping the blood right, for making the bones 
firm, and, in short, for keeping the body in perfect condition. 

The selection of foods to meet these conditions is discussed 
in the following chapter. 



Economical Cooking 15 

HOW TO PLAN MEALS 

The old idea that a person should eat what he " craves " is 
not a safe one to follow, since he may crave food that is actu- 
ally harmful, or, at least, that which is useless for nourishing 
the body. 

To plan meals wisely, it is necessary to think of several 
things : 

First. The ages, occupations, and general health of the dif- 
ferent members of the family. 

Second, The proper combinations of foods to fill these 
needs. 

Third. The season of the year. 

Fourth. The cost of food. 

Foods Suited to Various Ages 

Bottle-fed infants need very carefully prepared milk (see 
Chapter 28). 

Foods for children from one to two years are discussed on 
pages 114-115. Above all, the mother should remember that 
the truest kindness sometimes lies in not considering the 
whims or fancied dislikes of children, but in giving food 
that is known to be the right food, and in teaching self-control 
and obedience. 

Much suffering in after life may be avoided by this training, 
and the child will grow into a man or woman with a good 
fund of resistance to bad dietetic habits; even the deadly 
alcoholism may be more easily fought, if there is an inherited 
tendency. 

Foods Allowed Child Two to Four Years 

Eggs — soft-boiled. Stale bread and butter. Baked potato. 
Broths, cooled and skimmed. Zwieback. Orange juice. Boiled fish. 



16 Economical Cooking 

Milk. Beef juice. Boiled rice. Junket. Prune juice. One or two 
tablespoonfuls of mashed and strained peas, onions, or carrots. 



Child Four to Eight Years 

To the above there may be added: 

Slightly larger servings of vegetables. Broiled steak or chop. Cus- 
tards. Cream of vegetable soups (see page 112). Simple puddings. 
Very ripe scraped bananas. Baked bananas. Cocoa. 

Child Eight Years and Upward 

Practically the same as above, except that servings are 
larger. 

Foods Forbidden All Children 

Tea and coffee. Pastry. Rich puddings. All fried food. Pickles. 
Fancy sauces for meat or fish. Alcoholic drinks. 

How Occupation Influences Diet Needs 

Persons who sit at work must have light, easily digested 
food, and food that contains much nourishment in small space. 

Those who are active may eat more " hearty," bulky food, 
especially if their work is in the open air. 

General Health 

If any member of the family is out of health, a physician 
should be consulted, and the diet prescribed followed very 
carefully, as the very life of the person may depend upon 
this care. 

Proper Combination 

Study the chapter on Food Values, and learn the kinds of 
food tfaat best build up the body. For example, if the allow- 
ance of butter or other fat is small, increase the amount of 



Economical Cooking 17 

starchy food. If very little meat is eaten, see that there are 
plenty of eggs, milk, etc. 

Consult the list of foods making up the " mixed diet," page 
14, and you will have a guide. 

Remember that spicy, greasy, or heavy food is equally in- 
jurious for grown persons as for children, only that the for- 
mer are not so easily made really ill as are children. 



HOW TO BUY ECONOMICALLY 

Buying economically is simply buying in such a way that 
every penny spent will return as much strength as possible. 

Ten cents spent for rice will not give as much strength as 
ten cents spent for bread or oatmeal. 

We know in a general way how much strength-giving food 
is needed, and the following table or diet list shows how vari-» r 
ous quantities of different foods, all making for the same! i 
amount of nourishment, vary in cost. 

Food Required Cost 

Milk 7 pts. $ .35 

Round steak . 1 lb. .18-20 

Eggs 20 .80 

Oysters 4 pts. 1.00 

This table does not show the amounts of fat and starch in 
the different foods, but is given simply in an attempt to in- 
terest housekeepers in the subject of the cost of food. Any- 
one will see the advantage of knowing the relative cost of 
necessary food, as obtained in different foodstuffs, and will 
realize that it is folly to spend one dollar if the same strength- 
giving material may be had for fifty cents. 

This is only the beginning of the subject, however, for it 
is the business of the housekeeper to see that the food pur- 
chased at fifty cents is adapted to the needs of her family in 
2 



18 Economical Cooking 

other ways, that it is in suitable form for the individual diges- 
tive peculiarities, etc. 

It is literally true that we " live by what we digest," so 
that, at certain times, and for certain persons, oysters are the 
right and economical food to buy, even although we could get 
the same amount of strength from some other food at half 
the cost. 

For the normal family, however, in their ordinary, daily liv- 
ing, it is worth while to study carefully how to make the less 
expensive food attractive, so that money may be saved for 
other needs and health-giving pleasures. 

It is not the plan of this little book to do more than suggest 
lines of study. 

How to Buy Milk 

The only economical way to buy milk is to buy it from a 
reputable firm, and from one whose dairies, bottling plant, 
shipping depots, etc., are freely open to inspection. Other- 
wise, there is danger of disease. " Loose " milk is never safe. 

Clean milk in clean bottles is really a cheap food, as it 
contains strength in a form quickly digested, and for the 
money spent, it gives a large proportion of nourishment. 

One of the bulletins issued by the Department of Agricul- 
ture at Washington * shows that even skim milk is a good and 
economical food ; the fat lost in the cream can be made up from 
other foods. 

Luncheon of Bread and Milk 

Bread 8 oz. $ .04 

Milk 1 pt. .05 

Total cost / $ .09 

The above luncheon, this bulletin points out, gives one third 
the amount of strength needed for an entire day, and the same 

* Farmers' Bulletin No. 74 



Economical Cooking 



19 



amount of strength would cost more than double in the form 
of an ordinary restaurant luncheon of soup, meat, bread, and 
coffee. 

The preparation of milk is discussed in another chapter, 
page 114. 

How to Buy Meat 

Expensive cuts of meat do not give as much strength as the 
cheaper cuts, and much money may be saved if care is taken 
to cook the meat so as to make it appetizing and digestible. 

It should be remembered, however, that some of the cheap 
cuts contain much bone and waste, so that, in the end, they are 
not really cheap.

Note. — The above are New York prices. 

How to Buy Staple Groceries 

Whenever possible, such things as flour, sugar, potatoes, 
etc., should be bought in quantities, as they are always cheaper 
purchased in that way. If it is necessary, however, to buy in 
small quantities, through lack of storage space, we should ask 
for a fixed amount, as " three quarters of a pound " or ' " a 
quarter of a pound," but never " ten cents* worth." 

The housekeeper should read the storekeeper's scale while 
he is weighing the food purchased, and then weigh it again 
on her own scales at home. 

How to Buy Fruit and Vegetables 
These should be neither under-ripe nor over-ripe. 
If bought from pushcart vendors or at open stands, skins 
must be washed and removed.

How to Tell the Age of an Egg 

Place the egg in a tumbler two thirds full of water and note the 
following: 




If perfectly fresh the egg will rest at the bottom of 
the tumbler as shown in figure 1. 




If not quite so fresh, say from two to four weeks old, 
the big end of the egg will rise higher than the small 
end. 




If two, three or four months old the egg will take the 
position shown in figure 3. 




If older the egg will float upright, the larger end 
rising out of the water as shown. 



The cause of this is due to evaporation within the shell. As the egg 
becomes older the water evaporates and the empty space at the thick 
end of the egg enlarges. The larger the empty space the more the egg 
will rise until in time it floats upright as shown, the larger end rising 
out of the water.

Equipment 

The above plan is for a family of two, and takes for granted 
that the housekeeper is willing to get along without some con- 
veniences. It is a good plan to begin with the bare essentials 
and add utensils from time to time. 

The question of labor-saving devices needs thought. Un- 
doubtedly a large family can save time and strength by using 
some of the practical ones, but the young housekeeper will do 
very well if she has a good bread mixer and a fireless cooker. 

Fireless Cookers 
Very practical fireless cookers can be made at home, but 
small ones can be bought at low cost, and the housewife will 




'do well to add one to her kitchen, as much fuel and labor may 
thus be saved. 

The principle involved is a simple one — that is, the hold- 
ing of all heat and making this heat carry on the cooking. 

Begin the cooking exactly as if it were to be carried on in 
the regular way — fifteen minutes for vegetables, thirty for 
Stew or soup — and then place the covered kettle of food in the 
cooker without an instant's delay, cover tightly, and leave for 
twelve to fifteen hours, according to food. 

It is well to remember that the cooker will simmer, but will 



Economical Cooking 25 

not boil food. Anything that needs rapid boiling must be 
cooked on the stove, but tough meat and most vegetables may 
be cooked slowly. 

Construction and Use of Home-made Fireless Cooker 

MATERIALS NEEDED 

Galvanized iron garbage can, " No. 2," 

Sawdust, 

Two yards denim, 

Covered agate pail, 2-4 qts. 

Method 

Place loose sawdust in bottom of can, so that when food 
kettle and top cushion are in place all space will be filled. 

Fold denim lengthwise, make a long bag, about two inches 
deeper than food kettle, fill with sawdust, lay flat on table, 
spread sawdust evenly, and roll bag around food kettle, so 
that a smooth, firm nest is formed when bag is placed upright 
in can on top of sawdust. From remaining denim make a 
round bag (the material will have to be pieced for this), fill 
with sawdust. 

Use of Cooker 

Begin all cooking precisely as if it were to be carried on in 
the ordinary way. When* food is at boiling heat, after having 
boiled the required length of time, place quickly in nest 
formed by long cushion, cover with round cushion, place gal- 
vanized cover over all, and let stand for required time. 

The following is a table showing foods best adapted for 
preparation in the home-made cooker:

ARRANGING AN ATTRACTIVE TABLE 

Food may be of the best quality and perfectly cooked, and 
if it is put on the table in a helterskelter way, or served on 
sticky dishes, it may fail to nourish properly those who eat it. 

This is only another way of saying that digestion is easily 
influenced by small things. 

On the other hand, if it is necessary to plan meals that are 
very inexpensive, the food will give more strength if great care 
is taken to make it attractive, since even the plainest food, 
wisely selected, will be digested quickly if it is attractively 
served. 

Some rules for arranging a table attractively: 

1. See that the table itself, even if it is of the plainest wood, 
is rubbed free from any stickiness or dust. 

2. Economize on quality, if necessary, but have spotlessly 
clean tablecloths and table napkins. 

3. Do not be unhappy if you cannot have expensive china 
and glass. An ample stock of pretty blue and white or even 
plain white china is better than one or two costly pieces and 
a general supply that is chipped or cracked. Wonderfully 
pretty china may be bought at very low cost. 

4. Whenever possible, have a bit of green in the middle of 
the table. On country walks gather wild flowers or ferns for 
this. In the winter you may be able to have some berries or 
bright foliage, and it will add much to the pleasure of the 
table. 

5. Housewives keeping house in a modest way do not need 
solid silver. A moderate supply of good plated ware will give 
perfect satisfaction, and if kept bright and shining will give 
another touch of attractiveness. 

6. In whatever room the table is set, try to have it near a 
window, for a shaded dining table is very unsatisfactory. 

7. A general rule that includes all the others is: No matter 



Economical Cooking 27 

how simple, let the table show absolute cleanliness and atten-

THE DANGERS OF THE KITCHEN 
Care of Food 

The chief danger of the kitchen is, to use a good old- 
fashioned word, dirt. Good housekeepers have always fought 
dirt instinctively, but we are coming more and more to realize 
just why it was such a menace to health. 

Dirt gives a breeding place for the countless tiny living 
things that are in the air all about us. Many of these little 
bodies are harmless, some are really beneficial, but there are 
some that cause disease. It is very foolish to make ourselves 
miserable about these germs, but it is a good thing to think 
about them enough to make sure that we have no corners where 
they will grow. Cleanliness, light, and air will keep them out 
better than anything else. 

Some Good Rules 

1. Buy at stores where everything is kept clean. 

2. Do not use raw fruit and vegetables that have been ex- 
posed to the air of the streets or to careless handling. 

3. Boil drinking water if there is any reason to suspect its 
purity. 

4. Keep all utensils, bread, pie, and cake tins, etc., scalded, 
dried, and aired. 

5. Keep all parts of the ice box cleansed frequently with 
boiling water and soda. 

6. In washing dishes, change the water frequently and 
rinse every dish in hot water after washing in hot suds. 

7. Keep dish cloths and sink cloths scalded, sweet, and 
clean. 



28 Economical Cooking 

8. Do not allow pet dogs and cats in the kitchen. 

9. Never allow insect pests to get headway. Cockroaches, 
water bugs, etc., may be driven out by care, but it is better 
not to let them get in. There is a phosphorescent paste on the 
market that is the best thing to use if these pests do show 
themselves. 

10. Never leave soiled dishes or broken bits of food about 
the kitchen. 

11. Fight the common house fly, as it may easily carry 
disease. 

12. Remember that here, as in most other things, " an ounce 
of prevention is worth a pound of cure." 





COOKING 



PART II 



CHAPTER I 
RECIPES AND HOW TO USE THEM 

Principles of Cookery 

Many old-time cooks used very few rules, relying on what 
they called " judgment/' and being quite scornful of rules. 
Modern domestic science women sometimes go to the other 
extreme and depend so entirely on rules that they do not exer- 
cise their reasoning powers. 

A good plan is to be very exact, but to use this very " judg- 
ment " in adapting recipes. 

No recipe can be written so as to exactly meet all condi- 
tions. Different grades of flour absorb varying amounts of 
moisture; cornstarch will vary in thickening qualities; flavor- 
ing extracts will vary in strength; sugar will not always have 
the same sweetening power. 

Select recipes that have been tested, and if, in the working 
out, they need slight changes, learn how to do this intelli- 
gently. 

29 



30 Economical Cooking 

A little practice will teach just how cake batter should 
u feel " on the spoon, just how bread " sounds " when it is 
baked, just the moment when boiled frosting is done, etc. 
The point is to train the eye and hand to work together, zo 
that one need not depend on others, but will " know " oneself. 

There are a few principles of cooking that form the founda- 
tion of all science. Each of the great classes of food spoken 
of on page 14 is governed by one or more of these prin- 
ciples. 

Flavoring 

Flavoring extracts should never be added until near the end 
of the cooking. 

The Cooking of Meat, Milk and Eggs, or Strength Foods 

Meat and egg-white are somewhat alike in structure, and 
heat affects them in very much the same way. Heat that is 
too intense hardens these foods, making them tough and indi- 
gestible. This applies to the heat used in boiling, and the 
rules for boiling eggs and meat insist on slow cooking or " sim- 
mering." In broiling or searing meat, heat is used to form a 
coating which keeps in the juice. 

In making soup, meat is plunged in cold water to draw out 
the juice. 

The point as to just what changes take place in the boiling 
of milk is still unsettled; but most physicians agree that the 
nutritive value of the milk is changed, and that unless there is 
danger of contamination by disease germs, it is better to use 
raw milk for infant feeding. 

There is, of course, no objection to the cooking of milk in 
custards, puddings, etc. 

The Cooking of Fats 
Fats are used in cooking chiefly in frying, and the proper use 
of the term " frying " is not always understood. 



Economical Cooking 31 

Properly speaking, frying means dropping in a kettle of 
deep fat, and the common practice of browning food in an 
omelet pan is called sauteing. 

The aim in cooking with fat is to see that it is hot enough 
to cook the food without soaking into it. 

Fat is ready for cooked mixtures if it will brown a bit of 
bread while one counts forty, and for uncooked if it will brown 
the bit of bread while one counts sixty. 

In sauteing, see that pan and fat are sizzling hot before the 
food goes in, otherwise the food will be greasy. 

The Cooking of Starchy Food 

The first necessity for this is rapidly boiling water, the sec- 
ond, long continued cooking. If these two rules are ob- 
served, cereals, potatoes, etc., will not be pasty and sticky. 

The Cooking of Vegetables 

Most vegetables contain some starch and a woody substance 
besides, and the above rule of beginning with boiling, not 
V; hot," water holds good here, also, although the length of time 
required is not so great as that needed for cereals. 

Thickening with Flour or Cornstarch 

The two methods most commonly used to prevent flour or 
cornstarch from lumping are: 

1. Rubbing to a smooth paste in cold water; then adding 
paste to boiling water, stirring constantly. 

2. Blending with melted butter or fat; then adding hot 
liquid to make a sauce. 

White Sance 

This is used as a basis for " cream " soups, for creamed 
vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, etc., and in making croquettes.

used, are as follows:

Method

gradually, blending carefully; season; cook five minutes. 

Use of Steam 

The use of the double boiler or of an improvised one (p. 28) 
is necessary in cooking all starchy food. 

In cooking of eggs in custard, by standing cup or pan con- 
taining mixture in larger pan of hot water, the egg is kept 
from separating or V curdling."

CHAPTER II 

BEVERAGES 

Beverages are important, as they give the necessary fluid 
to the diet, and their wise selection and careful preparation 
add much to the attractiveness and healthfulness of the daily 
meals. 

Cold Beverages 
Water 

Few persons drink enough water. At least one quart a 
day should be taken, besides what is found in food. Part of 
this water may be taken in the form of beverages, but nearly 
everyone is the better for at least three glasses a day of fresh, 
cool water. 

The question of drinking at meals should be decided by indi- 
viduals or by the physician. 

Fruit Beverages 

These are excellent in warm weather and should be used 
freely. The standard lemonade is a good starting point, and 
one may vary combination of fruit juice, sugar and water, to 
give an almost endless variety of refreshing beverages. 

Recipes 

Lemonade 

*/4 CU P lemon juice. Boil sugar and water ten minutes. 

1 cup sugar. Add lemon juice; cool. 

1 pint water. Then add cold water to suit taste.

34 Economical Cooking 

Orangeade 
Make the same as lemonade. 

Grape Juice 
4 cups Concord grapes. 1% cup sugar. 1 pint water. 

Wash grapes, remove stems, add water and cook one hour. 
Add sugar and cook thirty minutes longer. Strain, put into 
bottles and seal with sealing wax. 

Shrub 

A pleasant summer drink is made by adding a few spoonfuls 
of fruit jelly to a glass of cool water. Stir until dissolved, 
and add sufficient quantity of jelly to suit taste. 

Hot Beverages 

Simple heat has a slightly stimulating effect, and it is safer 
to depend on the simple hot drinks than upon alcoholic stimu- 
lants. The latter should never be given except in cases of 
shock or great exposure, nor should their use be continued 
even for a short time, except on advice of a physician. 

The use of tea and coffee should never begin under twenty 
years of age, and even then a physician should decide as to 
whether they may be used safely. 

Cocoa and chocolate are mildly stimulating, but the reaction 
is very slight. 

Cereal Coffees 

In preparing cereal coffees, it is quite safe to follow direc- 
tions on package. Malt coffee should be ground before using. 

Chocolate 

1 ounce chocolate. % cup boiling water. 

2 tablespoons sugar. 1% cups hot milk and water. 



Economical Cooking 35 

Melt chocolate with sugar in double boiler, add boiling wa- 
ter, stirring constantly; cook directly over fire for five min- 
utes, return to double boiler, cook twenty minutes and add hot 
milk and water. 

Cocoa 

2 level tablespoons cocoa. 1 cup boiling water. 
1 of sugar. 1 cup hot milk. 

Water to make thin paste. 

Stir cocoa and sugar to a paste with boiling water, add one 
cup of boiling water; cook directly over fire for five minutes, 
place in double boiler, cook twenty minutes, add hot milk and 
serve. 

Cocoa Shells 
y z cup shells. 3 cups cold water. 

Let simmer for one hour, strain and serve. 

Breakfast Coffee 

5 level tablespoons of coffee. 2% cups water. 

4 tablespoons cold water. 2 tablespoons cold water (for 
Shell of one egg or a little egg- settling), 

white. 

Stir to a paste the coffee, crushed eggshell or egg-white and 
the four tablespoons of cold water. Of the two and one-half 
cups of' water, add one cup cold to coffee paste, bring to boil- 
ing, add remaining cup and one-half of water at boiling heat; 
let all boil three minutes and pour one tablespoon cold water 
down spout. Let stand to settle. 

Tea 

3 teaspoons tea. 2 cups boiling water. 

Scald earthen or granite teapot, put in tea, add boiling water, 
remove to cool part of stove, steep three minutes only. Tea

made with a tea ball at the table is particularly mild, and is 
the least harmful method of preparation. 

After-Dinner Coffee 

In black coffee use double the amount of coffee as that used 
for breakfast coffee. 

Cereal Coffee 

Malt coffee or any of the cereal coffees on the market make 
good tea and coffee substitutes for those to whom these are 
forbidden. 

Directions: Follow all directions on package very care- 
fully, although the strength may be varied to suit the taste. 

Cocoa Shells and Coffee 

For those who wish to decrease the strength of the coffee 

drunk, a very good combination is cocoa shells and coffee. 

Directions: To each cup of coffee (p. 35) add one-half cup 

of cocoa shells (p. 85). This is good to break off the coffee 

habit gradually. 

Cambric Tea for Children 

1 cup milk. Sugar to taste. 

1 cup hot water. Speck of salt. 

Heat milk, add hot water, salt and sugar. Serve very hot. 



CHAPTER III 
BREAD, BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC. 

Bread Making 

If the housekeeper is strong, she should make her own 
bread; and even if she has to consider her strength, it can be 
made easily with a bread-mixer. 

Home-made bread is more nourishing than baker's bread. 

General Remarks 

Bread is raised either by yeast or baking powder. The ac- 
tual process of leavening is somewhat complicated, and this 
chapter will discuss only the practical side. 

The texture of the bread depends on the kneading. A fine- 
grained loaf is the result of thorough mixing. 

Proportions 

Liquid, 1 part. Flour, 3 to 4. 

Salt, y 3 teaspoon to a loaf. Shortening, 1 tablespoon to a loaf. 

Yeast 

Set overnight, dough requires one-third cake to a pint of 
liquid. 

Set in morning, dough will require one-half to one whole 
cake to each pint, according to time the bread is needed. 

Mixing 

The flour is beaten into the liquid, and the batter should be 
kept at an even consistency; when it becomes a dough, by the

addition of more flour, it is turned out on a floured board and 
kneaded until firm and elastic. Only practice will give the 
" knack - of this. 

Baking Powder Dough 

The whole secret of light baking biscuits is in very delicate 
handling. Toss with the finger tips only, and put out before 
cutting out biscuits.

CHAPTER V 

CAKE 

There are two general classes of cakes: sponge cakes and 
butter cakes. The former are made light by eggs and con- 
tain no shortening. The butter cakes vary in " richness " ac- 
cording to amount of shortening. 

General Rules 

In mixing butter cakes, cream butter very thoroughly. 

Fold in whites of eggs last of all. 

Do not " slam " oven door while cake is in oven. 

Test cake by use of clean broom-straw. If straw comes out 
dry, if loaf shrinks from edge of pan, and if it " sings " with 
a slight hissing sound, the cake is done. 

Turn from pan at once, and let cool without covering. 

Dried fruit should be dredged with flour before adding to 

cake.

CHAPTER VI 
CANNING AND PRESERVING 

Canning is a method of keeping fruit by placing it in 
clean air-tight jars, and usually sugar is added. The amount 
of sugar used should be one-third the weight of the fruit and 
three cups of water to each pound of sugar. 

Method 
Make a thin syrup by boiling the sugar and water together 
for about ten minutes ; then cook a small amount of fruit at a 
time in this syrup. Fill clean jars with fruit and add enough 
syrup to fill jars to overflowing. Place on rubber and screw 
on cover. Let stand until cool and tighten cover again. 

To Clean Jars 

1. Wash thoroughly and fill with cold water. 

2. Place in large kettle filled with cold water. 

3. Heat to boiling point, remove from fire and empty bot- 
tles. 

4. Place covers in boiling water and let stand five minutes. 

5. Dip rubbers in hot water. 

Selection of Fruit for Canning 
Fruit should be fresh, firm and not too ripe. 

Canning of Vegetables 
Prepare vegetables, place in jars and fill with cold water. 
Put on rubbers and cover, but not tightly. Place a towel in 
the bottom of a kettle and put jars on it. Fill kettle with cold 
50 



Economical Cooking 51 

water, bring to boiling point and boil one hour. Fill jars to 
overflowing with boiling water and fasten covers. 

Jellies 
The amount of sugar used in jelly-making is usually equal 
to the weight of fruit. Prepare fruit and place on fire; heat 
slowly to extract the juice. Spread sugar on a pan and heat 
in the oven. Add to fruit and boil about two minutes. Try 
a little on a cold saucer; as soon as it jellies it is cooked enough 
and is ready to pour into glasses. Let juice from juicy fruits 
cook about five minutes before adding sugar. Cover glasses 
with melted paraffin. 

Preserving 
When preserving fruit use from one-half to equal weight of 
sugar. 

Orange Marmalade 

4 large sour oranges. 3% pints cold water. 

3 lemons. 4 pounds granulated sugar. 

Scrub fruit and cut in thin slices crosswise. Cover with 
cold water and let stand overnight. Simmer two hours, add 
sugar and cook one hour. Pour into glasses and cool. Seal. 

Strawberry Preserve 

Clean and hull berries and place in kettle, also an equal 
amount of sugar. Heat slowly and cook ten minutes. Remove 
skim. Place in clean jars and seal. 

Suitable Fruits for Canning and Preserving 



Cherries. 


Pears. 


Peaches. 


Apricots. 


Plums. 


Blueberries, 


Strawberries. 


Rhubarb. 


Blackberries. 


Pineapple, 


Raspberries. 





The recipes in this chapter are given as illustrations. 



CHAPTER VII 
CASSEROLE COOKING 

In the chapter on Fireless Cookers, it has been noted that 
very slow cooking will make tough meat tender and bring out 
the flavor of any food cooked in this way. The same princi- 
ple is used in cooking in covered baking dishes. The casserole 
is the largest of these dishes, and beside this, we have rame- 
quins or small covered dishes, egg shirrers and Dariole moulds 
or custard cups. 

One advantage of this method is that food can be brought 
to the table in the same dishes as those used in cooking, and so 
it may be kept piping hot. The casserole may be placed in 
the outer plated cover before bringing it to the table. 

Mixtures such as minced chicken and white sauce with beaten 
white of egg may be baked in small custard cups. These cups 
should be placed in a shallow pan of hot water (page 32). 

Chicken En Casserole 

Cut up a chicken as for fricassee, wipe each piece, saute in 
butter until brown, place in casserole, cover with chicken stock 
or boiling water. Cover and bake one-half hour, then add 
a dozen slices of carrot and potato, five or six tiny onions 
browned in butter, seal dish with dough and bake half an 
hour longer, or until the vegetables are tender. 

Braised beef (page 84) may be cooked deliciously in the 
casserole. 

52 



Economical Cooking 53 

Lamb En Casserole 

1 pound breast of lamb. 1 small onion. 

Va CU P tomatoes. Water to half cover. 

Cut meat in slices for serving, dredge with flour, add vege- 
tables and water. Cover and cook two hours. Add one-quar- 
ter cup rice and, if necessary, more water; cover and cook an- 
other hour. 

Vegetables En Casserole 
Cut-up potatoes, celery, turnips or carrots may be browned 
in dripping, covered with brown gravy (page 82) and cooked 
in the casserole about three-quarters of an hour. Do not have 
too much of the gravy. 

Shoulder Chops En Casserole 
Prepare shoulder according to Lamb En Casserole and cook 
slowly in casserole for two hours. 

Veal Chops 
Cook the same as above. 

Beef Heart En Casserole 
Clean heart, plunge in boiling water, simmer for one hour, 
cut in slices, place in casserole, cover with strained and thick- 
ened tomato juice, cook two hours. 



CHAPTER VIII 
CEREALS 

Points to Remember 

1. Have water boiling. 

2. Add salt. 

3. Sift cereal in slowly. 

4. Cook over fire until thickening begins. 

5. Place kettle in large kettle containing boiling water and 
cook several hours, according to the kind. It may be cooked 
overnight or in fireless cooker (p. 25). 

6. Different kinds of cereals need different amounts of 
water. A general rule is two and a half times as much water 
as grain, and a teaspoon of salt for every quart of water. 

Chopped dates, figs or raisins may be added to cooked mush. 
This makes a good dessert. 



1 cup 



Table for Cereals 



Grain 


Water 


Rolled oats 


2 cups. 


Cornmeal 


6 cups. 


Hominy 


4 cups. 


Farina 


2 cups. 


Cream of wheat 


2 cups. 


Petti John's 


2 cups. 


Rice 


6 cups. 



Time for cooking at least 
one hour, the longer the 
better, except in the 
case of rice which should 
boil rapidly for twenty 
minutes. 



Cereal Moulded with Fruit 
Any cereal may be made more appetizing and attractive by 
the addition of various fruits, raw or stewed. When the 
cereal has been cooked, it may be put in a cup and allowed to 

54 



Economical Cooking 55 

cool. Then turn it out on to a cereal dish and surround with 
stewed prunes, apricots or apple sauce, sliced bananas or fresh 
fruit in season. 

Fried Mush 
Cold cornmeal or any other mush may be sliced, dipped in 
flour and browned in frying pan with dripping. This is excel- 
lent with molasses, syrup or butter. 

Cereal with Dates 

2 cups cooked mush. % cup chopped dates. 

Cook together until dates are thoroughly soft. 

Cereal with Raisins 
Cook as above, only in place of dates add one-half cup 
chopped raisins. 

Cereal Puddings 
Cold cereal may be reheated, sweetened to taste, chopped 
fruit added, with a beaten egg with milk to give lightness. 
The whole is then dotted with butterine and baked. 

Cereal Gems 

Use cold cooked mush, stir in a very little sugar and enough 

beaten egg and milk to make a soft mixture. Bake in hot muffin 

pans. If light gems are desired, use a teaspoon of baking 

powder sifted with half cup of flour for each cup of mush. 



CHAPTER IX 
CHAFING DISH COOKERY 

Anything that can properly be cooked in a double boiler 
can be prepared in a chafing dish. To use this successfully, 
it is necessary to understand the cooking of food over hot water 
(see page 32). 

The greatest care must be taken in the use of a chafing 
dish, to prevent accidents — in filling and handling. The 
chafing dish should rest on a metal tray. 

Rules 

Creamed Dishes 
Make a thin white sauce (page 32) and serve with flaked 
cold fish, oysters, peas, lobster, chicken or anything desired. 

Egg Dishes 
Eggs may be hard boiled, cut up and creamed, or scrambled 
and served with grated cheese, or with tomato sauce. 

Warmed Over Dishes 

Corned Beef Hash 
Equal parts of chopped cold corned beef and potato. Place 
in blazer over the hot water pan, moisten with milk and brown 
with a little butter. 

Minced Meat on Toast 
Use cold steak or roast beef, put through meat chopper, 
season nicely, add a little chopped onion, or shredded pep- 
56 



Economical Cooking 57 

pers, tomato or anything fancied. Place in blazer, cover with 
brown gravy (see page 86) and heat thoroughly. Serve on 
toast. 

Young housekeepers are advised, if they use a chafing dish, 
to stick to plain creamed dishes and warmed over dishes, like 
those outlined above, rather than to attempt elaborate combi- 
nations that require much butter and other expensive additions. 

The remarks on seasoning (page 29) apply equally here, for 
everyone has a chance to give real character to a dish by a 
little care. 

Dried Beef 

Pick up one cup dried beef, cover with tomato sauce, add 
one tablespoon butter, heat and stir in three beaten eggs. 
Cook until eggs are creamy. 

Omelet with Cheese 

For a medium size omelet use two eggs, season with salt and 
pepper, add three teaspoons melted butter and two teaspoons 
grated cheese. Cook until firm. Sprinkle with grated cheese. 

Chafing Dish Rarebit 

For each cup of hot milk use a scant cup of crumbs. Soak 
these in the milk, then add two teaspoons melted butterine, 
one-half cup of cheese chopped fine; then stir in an egg, after 
white and yolk have been beaten separately. Add yolk before 
taking from stove, and white after removing. 

French Toast 

4 slices stale bread. % cup milk. 

2 eggs. y 8 teaspoon salt 

1 tablespoon sugar. 

Beat eggs, milk, sugar and salt together. Dip slices of 
bread in this and brown on greased pan. 



CHAPTER X 

§ 
CHEESE 

A small piece of cheese contains a large amount of nour- 
ishment, and if cheese is used wisely it is a valuable food. 
The mistake made by many is that of eating cheese in large 
quantities, at the same meal with other " hearty " food. 

This is especially true if cheese is eaten raw, for it is then 
masticated more or less imperfectly and the stomach has too 
much work to do. 

How to Use Cheese 

If eaten in any quantity, cheese should form the chief dish 
of a meal at luncheon or supper; it may be eaten uncooked in 
sandwiches, or it may be grated or chopped very fine and 
stirred very slowly into hot cereals or used on toast, etc. 

Cereal and Cheese 

2 cups boiling water. % pound grated cheese. 

y 2 teaspoon salt. i^ cup fine grained cereal. 

(Cornmeal, hominy, cream of wheat, etc.) 

Stir chopped or grated cheese slowly into hot cereal. 

Cheese Fondu 

1 cup milk. 1 egg. 

1 cup bread crumbs. Salt, pepper and mustard. 

% cup grated cheese. 

Soak bread crumbs in milk, heat, add cheese, season, and 
when cheese is melted and stirred through the crumbs, add 
58 



Economical Cooking 59 

beaten egg and remove from fire. Spread on crackers or 
toast. This is the most wholesome form of rarebit. 



Cheese Pudding 

Fill a small pudding dish as follows: 

Dip slices of bread in milk and egg beaten together, place 
a layer of this soaked bread in the pan, sprinkle with a thick 
layer of grated cheese; add another layer of soaked bread, 
and so on until the dish is filled. Bake in slow oven until 
firm. 

Cheese Toast 
4 slices of toast. % pound grated cheese. 

Sprinkle cheese on toast, place slices on tin plate and leave 
in oven until cheese is melted. Serve very hot. 

Creamed Macaroni 

y 2 pound boiled macaroni. 2 tablespoons flour. 

3 cups white sauce. % pound cheese. 

Thicken milk with flour, rubbed to a paste in a little cold 
water. Chop cheese very fine and stir slowly through the hot 
sauce. 

Hominy Baked with Cheese 

Prepare boiled hominy in the ordinary way, stir grated 
cheese (one-quarter pound to two cups of cooked mush) 
through while hot, make into mound, dot with butter, and 
brown in oven. 

Rarebit 

y 2 pound cheese. 1 tablespoon butter. 

y 2 cup milk. Salt, pepper and mustard to 

y 2 teaspoon cornstarch. taste. 

Blend butter and cornstarch, add milk, then cheese and 
seasonings. Stir until cheese is smooth. Serve on crackers. 



60 Economical Cooking 

Eice and Cheese with Brown Gravy 

y 2 cup rice. 2 cups brown gravy. (See page 

14 pound grated cheese. 86.) 

Boil rice rapidly in three cups of water, stir cheese through 
slowly, so that heat of rice will melt it, pour on brown gravy 
and serve very hot. This is a nourishing substitute for meat. 

Cheese Crackers 

6 crackers. 10 tablespoons grated cheese. 

Place crackers in shallow pan, sprinkle cheese on top and 
bake until cheese melts. 



Cheese Porridge 

Stir grated cheese through any hot cooked mush. A good 
way to use up dry bits of cheese, as even a little increases food 
value of the mush. 

Cheese Custard 

Prepare baked custard mixture (p. 95) and sprinkle top 
with grated cheese before baking. 

Grated Cheese 
Grate Roman cheese and pass with plain rice or macaroni. 

Cheese Balls 
Make tiny balls of soft cheese and serve with salad. 



CHAPTER XI 
CONFECTIONS 

Pure candy is wholesome if not eaten in excess. With 
fondant as a foundation great variety of cream candy can be 
made, by using different flavors, adding nuts, etc. 

Chocolate Caramels 

2 cups sugar. 6 ounces chocolate. 

4 cups molasses. 2 teaspoons vanilla.

pieces. 

Caramel for Flavoring 

Equal parts of sugar and boiling water. 
Melt sugar in smooth omelet pan, stirring until it is brown, 
add water and cook slowly for twelve minutes. 






CHAPTER XII 
DECORATIONS 

The setting of an attractive table has already been spoken 
of, but the tasteful garnishing of the food itself is equally im- 
portant. 

When one can spend only a limited amount of money, it 
may not seem worth while to attempt the graceful touches that 
add so much to the pleasure of a meal, but this is a wrong idea. 
With scrupulous cleanliness as a foundation, one may take the 
next step, that is, an attempt to provide real charm, and this 
beauty touch has a decided effect on digestion, and conse- 
quently on health. 

A Few Simple Hints 

For two cents one can buy enough parsley to make the 
cheapest of shoulder chops look as dainty as those from the 
loin, to give flavor and character to the potato and other cream 
soup, to " dress up " a plain potato salad, to beautify the 
white sauce of left over fish, or for any of the other numberless 
uses to which a bit of green may be put. 

A plain cornstarch pudding may be moulded and served 
with a candied cherry on top of each mould. 

A salmon loaf is quite beautiful if served with a border of 
ordinary canned peas. 

Prosaic stews look attractive if the accompanying or boiled 
rice is carefully arranged in a border around the meat, instead 
of being served in a separate dish. Numerous modifications 
of the border idea are possible — combining diced carrots and 
peas for a meat loaf, etc. 

63 



64 Economical Cooking 

Everyone remembers his childish enjoyment of colored sugar 
on small cakes, or anything that gave a spice of novelty. 
The housekeeper should remember that no one ever outgrows 
entirely this pleasure in the novel or unexpected, so that when 
she bakes she may produce all manner of pretty effects with 
white and chocolate frosting, strawberry and lemon ice, etc. 

The more delicate flowers can always be used to advantage 
in decoration and a plain cake fairly bloom out from a wealth 
of green leaves. 

So simple a matter as the placing of wafers or small cakes on 
the plate gives an opportunity to produce a good effect. In- 
stead of a jumbled heap, long, narrow wafers may be placed 
to resemble the radiating spokes of a wheel, with a tiny round 
cake at the center. 

These few hints are given merely to show the housekeeper 
that it is worth while to put a little effort into the simplest of 
everyday matters, and to remind her that she will have her 
reward in the increased contentment and health of her family. 



CHAPTER XIII 
EGGS 

Boiled Eggs 

The proper term is " cooked eggs/' as it is important that 
eggs should not be boiled, but merely cooked in the steam of 
water that is at boiling point. In this way the white will be 
tender and jelly-like; the firmness may be regulated by length 
of time the egg remains in the water. 

Rule. — Wash eggs and place in saucepan of boiling water, 
cover, and move to cool part of stove where the water will not 
boil. 

Time in Water 

Soft egg 5 minutes. Hard egg 30 minutes. 

Medium egg .... 7 " 

Creamy or Coddled Egg 

For each beaten egg used, one-third cup of milk; season 
with salt and pepper; cook in double boiler until thick and 
creamy. Serve on toast. 

Use great care to see that the water in under part of boiler 
does not boil rapidly, as this would cause the white to harden, 
just as in the case of " boiled eggs." 

Fried Eggs 

Break eggs, one at a time, in a saucer, have bacon fat 
melted in hot omelet pan, slip eggs in carefully, and dip hot 
er them, as water is used in poaching eggs. 
> 65 



66 Economical Cooking 

Scrambled Eggs 

This rule follows naturally the rule for creamy egg, as the 
consistency in each case is about the same, although the method 
is different. 

Rule. — For each egg use a tablespoon of milk; separate 
white and yolk, beat yolks lightly, add milk, salt and pepper, 
beat whites until firm and fold into mixture. 

Have omelet pan hot with two tablespoons of melted butter 
(for four eggs), pour in mixture, place on stove and stir with 
fork as it thickens, and continue until soft and creamy. Lift 
pan from fire occasionally if heat is too great. 

Omelet Plain 

3 eggs. Salt and pepper. 

3 tablespoons milk. 

Beat all together, pour into buttered omelet pan, brown on 
under side, fold and turn out on smoking hot platter. 

Suggestions to Vary Omelets 

Sprinkle in grated cheese before folding. 
Sprinkle in grated ham. 
Sprinkle in mixture of cooked vegetables. 
Spread with jelly. 
Sprinkle with minced parsley. 

Add chopped raw peppers which have been cooked in butter 
until soft. 

Poached Egg 

Break egg in a saucer, slip carefully into pan containing 
simmering water. Dip water over egg occasionally, cook until 
white is firm, and remove to slices of toast. 



Economical Cooking 67 

General Remarks 

Eggs may be cooked hard and served in white sauce (page 
32). 

They may be cut up and used cold in salads. 

They may be served with tomato sauce, and in short they 
may be used in almost endless variety, to suit individual taste. 

Stuffed Eggs 
3 hard-boiled eggs. 1 cup white Atence seasoning. 

Cut eggs in halves lengthwise, take out yolks and mix 
smooth with milk and seasoning and chopped parsley, return 
to whites and serve with white sauce. 

Baked Eggs 
Prepare above and place in small pudding dish, cover with 
crumbs and brown in oven. 

Egg Timbales 
Prepare a firm, beaten custard and cook in small cups set 
in pan of water. 



CHAPTER XIV 
FISH 

The old-fashioned idea, that of fish being a " brain food " 
no longer prevails, but it is known that because fish is more 
quickly digested than some forms of meat, it furnishes ac- 
ceptable variety to diet, especially the diet of sedentary per- 
sons. The flesh of some fish, the so-called " white fishes," is 
less fat throughout than that of the oily fishes. 

Below is a list of common fish used for food: 

Bass. Porgies. 

Cod. Salmon. 

Crawfish. * Shad. 

Bluefish. Smelts. 

Flounder. Trout (fresh water). 

Finnan Haddie (dried). Mackerel. 

Haddock. White fish. 

Herring (smoked). 

To Select Fish 
See that flesh is firm and that the eyes and gills are bright. 

Shell Fish 

Clams. " Crabs. 

Oysters. Shrimps. 

Scallops. Lobsters. 

Preparation of Fish for Cooking 
Remove scales by scraping toward head. 
Clean inside. 

Cut skin near on the back, remove skin on each side, pull- 
ing toward tail. 
68 



Economical Cooking 69 

To bone — After skinning, take flesh from backbone from 
one side, then from the other. 



Baked Canned Salmon 

Pick up fish, remove all hard bits, add equal parts of bread 
crumbs, moisten with an egg beaten in a little milk, having 
mass of the right consistency to form a. smooth loaf in pudding 
pan, season, add chopped parsley, make into mound in baking 
pan, brown in oven. Crumbs dotted with bits of butter may 
be spread on top before browning. 

Baked Fish 

Spread some butter over an agate dripping-pan or cover with 
thin slices of fat salt pork. Sprinkle over it one onion minced 
fine. Lay on this a thin slice of halibut or any small, whole 
fish split down the middle. Add one tablespoon vinegar, 
and spread thickly with butter and flour rubbed together. 
Bake until done, the time depending upon the thickness of the 
fish. When the pan is buttered or pork laid under the fish, 
it may be easily removed with a flexible knife. Or a strip of 
cheesecloth or tough greased paper may be put underneath 
and be drawn out with the fish. 

Boiled Fish 

Fish for boiling should either be wrapped in cheesecloth 
or cut in slices and placed very carefully in the water to keep 
it from falling to pieces. Care should be taken not to cook 
fish too long or it will become tough. Boiled fish needs highly 
flavored sauces in order to make it palatable. The best kinds 
of fish for boiling are the so-called white varieties. Several 
authorities call attention to the fact that this is an extravagant 
way of cooking fish, unless the liquor is used, as in a fish stock. 



70 Economical Cooking 

Broiled Fish 
Remove head, tail and fins and split. Remove backbone 
from cod or haddock; cut large fish into inch slices. Brush 
fish and broiler with melted fat. Broil the flesh side until 
brown, then turn the skin toward the coal; or, with a gas 
stove, put broiler in pan in the upper oven for the last five 
minutes. Cook from ten to twenty minutes, according to thick- 
ness. 

Steamed Clams 

Wash shells well, scrubbing and changing water until it is 
absolutely clean. Place in kettle with one cup of hot water 
for half a peck, cover and steam until shells open slightly, 
remove from shells, pour liquor very carefully into a bowl or 
saucepan, strain, serve hot with butter. Serve this hot broth 
with the clams. 

Fried Clams 

Use steamed clams, remove from shell, rinse, dip in batter 
and fry. (See page 31.) 

Codfish Hash 

1 cup salt fish, shredded. % teaspoon pepper. 

2 cups diced boiled potatoes. % tablespoon melted dripping. 

Mash potatoes, stir into fish, place in pan with enough 
melted fat to moisten mixture, heat thoroughly, brown on both 
sides and serve. Codfish should always- be freshened by pour- 
ing on boiling water until salt is washed out. Do not soak nor 

boil. 

Creamed Codfish 

1 pound salt cod. 

Pick up codfish, freshen by pouring on boiling water; do 
not soak. When fish is freshened to suit taste, place it in 
pan, sprinkle with flour, cover with cold milk, cook, stirring 
constantly until soft and thick ; season. 



Economical Cooking 71 

Crabs 

Hard-Shelled Crabs. — The meat may be seasoned, chopped 
and made into a variety of dishes — creamed, patties, etc. 

Soft-Shelled Crabs. — Never use unless alive. Remove 
spongy part and pouch, rinse and use like lobster, oysters and 
clams. 

Shrimps 

Use like lobster in a sauce or made into salad. 

Creamed Fish 

For each cup of white sauce (page 32) use one and three- 
quarters cups of cold, flaked fish. Season with salt and pep- 
per, minced onion if liked, and chopped parsley. 

This may be made into scalloped fish by placing in an oiled 
baking dish, and covering with buttered crumbs. Place the 
pan in the oven until the crumbs are brown. 

Fish-balls 
Freshen salt codfish by placing the shredded fish in a colan- 
der and pouring boiling water through it until the salt is 
sufficiently washed away. For every cup of salt codfish allow 
two cups of mashed potato, half-tablespoon of melted drip- 
ping, one beaten egg y and pepper to taste. This may be made 
into fish-balls and browned in a frying-pan, or made into a 
large cake, the size of the pan, and browned first on one side 
and then on the other — this saves time and fat. 

Fried Oysters and Clams 
Dip in batter (page 74) and fry in deep fat. 

Broiled Oysters 
Dip large oysters in melted butter; season with salt and 
pepper and then in fine cracker crumbs. Put on buttered

broiler and cook five minutes or more until the juice begins to 
run. 

lobster 

Lobster may be served plain or made into fancy dishes, such 
as croquettes. It should be cooked just long enough to heat, 
or it will be tough. 

Creamed lobster 

y 2 cup minced lobster. Salt and pepper. 

White of egg. y& cup milk. 

y 2 tablespoon flour. Yolk of one egg. 
y 2 tablespoon butterine. 

Cook lobster with butter five minutes, add flour, seasoning, 
yolk of egg, then stiffly beaten white of egg. Bake in custard 
cups in pan of hot water. (See page 32.) 

Kippered Herring 

Remove fish from can and arrange on plate that may be 
put in the oven; sprinkle with pepper, brush over with lemon 
juice and a very little melted butter. Pour over the liquor 
left in the can. Heat thoroughly and garnish with parsley 
and slices of lemon. 

Scallops 
These may be creamed, fried or made into soup. 

To Prepare 
Rinse scallops, parboil in their own juice and drain. 

Sauce 

Thicken the liquor with butter and flour cooked together. 
Season, pour over scallops in a baking dish, cover with crumbs 
and bake until brown. 



Economical Cooking 73 

Scalloped Oysters 

1 pint oysters. y 2 cup stale bread crumbs. 

4 tablespoons oyster liquor. 1 cup cracker crumbs, buttered. 

2 tablespoons milk. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Mix bread and cracker crumbs. Put a thin layer in the 
bottom of a shallow baking dish, then add a layer of oysters. 
Season with salt and pepper. Moisten with part of the liquor 
and milk, add another layer of crumbs, alternating with 
oysters, and bake about half an hour with a layer of crumbs 
on top. 

Creamed Oysters 

For each pint of oysters use a cup and a half of white sauce 
(page 32) and an eighth of a teaspoon of celery salt. 

Pigs in Blankets 
Select large oysters, clean, wrap a thin slice of bacon around

CHAPTER XVI 
FRUITS 

Fruits are one of the most important articles of food, and 
if rightly used add much to the healthfulness of the diet. 
The common idea that they are indigestible, comes from the 
habit of eating them at the end of a hearty meal when the 
stomach is already overtaxed. 

,The best time to eat fruit is in the morning or at luncheon. 
However, if the evening meal is a light supper, stewed fruit 
is an excellent addition. 

Serving of Fruits 
Apples are very wholesome eaten raw. The skins should 
be washed, then removed, and the apple thoroughly masti- 
cated. 

Apple Compote 

Pare apples, cut in quarters, stew in a syrup made of equal 
parts of sugar and water; cook until quite tender, but see that 
each piece keeps its shape. Remove carefully to a pretty dish, 
then boil down syrup until thick and pour over apples. 

Apple Sauce 
Pare apples, stew until tender with sugar according to vari- 
ety of apple, and a very little water. Mash and strain 
through a colander. 

Baked Apples 
Wash and core apples, fill cavities with sugar and cinnamon 
mixed, stick blanched almonds in top of apples, place in shal- 
low pan and bake until soft.

CHAPTER XVIII 
MACARONI AND OTHER ITALIAN PASTES 

Macaroni, spaghetti and the other Italian pastes are valu- 
tble food, if properly used. The imported macaroni and some 
)f that made in this country is made of flour that contains 
i large amount of nourishment, but some of the American 
nacaroni is made of flour from soft wheat, and is mostly starch. 

Cooking of Italian Pastes 

All the pastes, whether it be the tiny noodles used in soup 
3r the coarser forms of spaghetti and macaroni, should be put 
into actively boiling water. Otherwise they will be pasty and 
sticky. The fine forms are used chiefly in soups, while many 
appetizing dishes can be made from spaghetti and macaroni. 

Baked Macaroni with Cheese 

% cup macaroni. Salt and pepper. 

2 tablespoons butter. Milk to cover. 

14 cup grated cheese. 

Butter a pudding pan, put in a layer of cooked macaroni, 
sprinkle with grated cheese, add another layer of macaroni, 
and so on until pan is nearly full. On top dot with bits of 
butter. Over all pour milk to nearly cover. Bake until cheese 
is melted. 

Macaroni may also be baked with alternate layers of 
chopped hard boiled eggs. Pour over white sauce to cover and 
leave in oven just long enough to heat thoroughly.

Pour over strained tomato juice, sprinkle with finely grated 
cheese, add another layer of macaroni and so on until the 
dish is nearly full, and for the top layer sprinkle stale bread 
crumbs dotted with tiny bits of butter. See that the dish has 
enough of the tomato juice poured through it and around it 
to thoroughly moisten all layers. Place in oven and brown 
crumbs. 



CHAPTER XIX 
MEAT— GAME— POULTRY 

How to Cook Meat 

The object of cooking meat is to make it tender and to keepi 
in the juice and preserve the flavor. To keep in the juice 
and preserve the flavor, sear the meat on both sides; that is, 
press it down quickly on a hot pan, and then turn and sear the 
other side. When the meat turns a whitey brown color, a 
coating has been formed which will keep in the juice. After 
searing the meat cook it slowly unless it is broiled. This will 
make it tender. Beef and mutton are the meats that are best 
for all persons. 

To make soup you need to draw out the juice. To do this, 
place the meat in cold water, bring to boiling point and cook 
gently until tender. 

Wipe meat with wet cloth ; do not wash in cold water, as this 
will draw out and waste the juice. 

Do not add salt to raw meat as it draws out the juice. Add 
it while cooking. 

For stew plunge meat in cold water, bring quickly to boil- 
ing point and let simmer, not boil, until tender. 

For pot roast, put meat into boiling water, then let simmer. 

To Broil Chops or Steak ' 

Wipe meat with a cloth wrung out of cold water, place on 

greased broiler and sear on one side, then turn and sear on 

the other. This is done by holding very near the fire, and 

when the red color disappears, it is a sign that the juices are 

83 



84 Economical Cooking 

sealed up. The meat can then be browned on each side, 
sprinkled with salt, spread with a small bit of butter and re- 
moved to a very hot platter. Do not add salt until the meat 
has been seared, as this will draw out the juice. 

If one has not a wire broiler, the meat can be pan-broiled 
on a sizzling hot, oiled frying pan. Enough fat will cook out 
of ordinary meat to finish the cooking without the addition of 
more fat. 

Beef Cutlets Braised

CHAPTER XX 
MILK 

Modern science is throwing light on much that has been 
taken for granted until the present time. For generations 
milk has been accepted as a food for children and invalids, 
but it was left for the last decade to unfold the possibilities of 
this subject. Milk is now discussed in relation to its food value, 
its care " from cow to consumer/' the dangers that may lurk 
in unclean milk, etc., etc. 

The United States Government issues bulletins on milk, emi- 
nent physicians argue the question " To pasteurize or not to 
pasteurize," food specialists find new uses for it in making 
up dietaries, and so it goes. 

Here follow some simple rules as to care and use of milk, 
with recipes for its preparation: 

Care 

Buy only bottled milk from a well-known firm. " Loose 
milk " is very unsafe. 

Keep bottles in cool place. 

Cleanse bottles as soon as emptied. 

Keep milk covered, no matter where it stands. 

Never allow anyone to drink from bottle or pitcher. 

Keep certain dishes or pails for milk only, never put any 
other food in them. 

Recipe for Junket 

Dissolve one tablet in teaspoon of cold water. Heat one 
quart milk to blood heat, add three tablespoons sugar, one 
teaspoon vanilla and the dissolved tablet. Pour into cups and 
let stand undisturbed for half an hour.

CHAPTER XXI 

NUTS 

Nuts are a very nourishing food, and like cheese contain 
a large amount of nutriment in small space. Because of this 
fact it is unwise to eat nuts at the close of a hearty meal. A 
better plan is to have them prepared in such a manner that 
they can be easily masticated and then to use them as the chief 
dish of a meal. 

Peanuts are the only nuts that are cheap, although almonds 
may be afforded occasionally. Both of these nuts should be 
made into meal, and then used in soup, or made into small 
cakes and cooked in the oven. 

Chestnuts are also good to use in soups or croquettes. 

Vegetarians depend very largely on nuts to take the place 
of meat, and in diabetes they are useful as a substitute for 
bread. 

In all cases the pulverizing is necessary, otherwise nuts are 
difficult of digestion. 

Nut butter makes a pleasant addition to the diet and may 
take the place of other butter. 

The addition of nuts to cake and candy renders these foods 
more nutritive, although in this form they should be used 
sparingly.

CHAPTER XXV 
SALADS AND DRESSINGS 

Most people do not realize the advantages of a salad as an 
every-day article of food. As a matter of fact, a salad should 
be an ordinary dish served as often as possible rather than an 
uncommon one. 

A meat salad, such as chicken or veal, with a cooked or 
mayonnaise dressing, may form the main dish for a supper 
or luncheon, while for a dinner a simple vegetable salad, such 
as lettuce served with a French dressing, is more desirable. 

Even in winter it is quite possible to serve salad, for our 
markets afford a large variety of greens, vegetables and fruits. 

Salads should always be served cold. If the vegetables to 
be used are not strictly fresh, they may be made so by soaking 
in cold water. They should then be drained, dried and kept 
in a cool place until served. The dressing may be added at the 
table or just before bringing on. 

Fruit Salad 

Almost any combination of fruits may be used to make a 
fruit salad. Fruit should be cut with a silver knife. 

To prepare oranges or grapefruit, remove peel and white 
covering, slice lengthwise that the tough center may not be, 
sliced. 

Bananas must be scraped to get rid of long threads inside of 
skin. 

For each person — 

1 lettuce leaf. 1 slice orange. 

1 slice canned peach. 1 slice grapefruit. 

1 slice canned pear. 
102 



Economical Cooking 103 

Arrange fruit across lettuce leaf so that the deeper colored 
fruits will alternate with the lighter colored. Cover with a 
French dressing. This salad may be garnished with strips 
of red and green pepper laid on fruit. 

Chicken Salad 
Use twice as much cold cooked chicken as chopped celery. 
Mix together and add either mayonnaise or boiled dressing. 
Arrange on lettuce leaves and place a stuffed lime in the 
center of each portion. 

Potato Salad 

2 cups of cold potatoes (boiled 1 small cucumber sliced, 
or baked) cut in pieces. Cooked salad dressing. 

1 small onion sliced. 

Serve on lettuce leaves and put radishes cut in pieces on top. 

Cooked Dressing for above 

' 1 tablespoon butterine. 1 teaspoon mustard. 

1 tablespoon flour. 1 teaspoon salt. 
1 cup milk. % teaspoon sugar. 

1 egg-yolk. Few grains Cayenne pepper. 
4 tablespoons vinegar. 

Melt butterine, add flour, stirring constantly. Remove from 
fire and add milk slowly. Cook until mixture boils. Add egg- 
yolk beaten slightly and cook over hot water two minutes. 
Remove from fire, place in pan of cold water and add vinegar 
and seasonings. This dressing may be put in a glass jar and 
will keep for several days. 

French Dressing 

1 tablespoon vinegar. Few grains pepper. 

2 tablespoons olive oil. Few drops of lemon juice (if 
% teaspoon salt. desired). 

Mix materials together by vigorous beating.

teaspoon, beating mixture constantly until thick. 

Pear Salad 

Two large pears cut in small pieces, one small onion, a little 
chopped parsley, chopped walnuts, if desired. Use mayon- 
naise or French dressing, and, in either case, a little rich 
cream is a decided improvement. Serve on lettuce leaves.

10. Shredded cabbage — pimento — cooked dressing. 



CHAPTER XXVI 
SANDWICHES 

For some time after their use began, sandwiches were very- 
simple affairs, consisting of two slices of bread with a slice of 
meat between. It was easy to see that much could be done to 
make sandwiches both varied and attractive. 

GENERAL RULES 

Use bread one day old. 
Cut bread very thin. 

Cream butter with a spoon before spreading. 
If cold meat is used, trim away all gristle and most of the 
fat. 

Slice meat thin. 

If lettuce is used, see that it is young and crisp. 

Meats Good for Sandwiches 
Cold corned beef dotted with mustard. 
Cold chicken. 
Cold boiled ham. 
Cold roast beef. 

Cold beefsteak, minced and seasoned with celery salt or 
Worcestershire sauce. 
Cold tongue. 

Other Attractive Sandwiches 

Chicken salad sandwich. (See page 105.) 
Cold boiled egg, chopped and mixed with salad dressing. 
106 



Economical Cooking 107 

Peanut butter. 

Chopped olives. 

Chopped walnuts mixed with cream cheese. 

Sliced Swiss or American cheese. 

Club Sandwich 

Toast two slices of bread. The filling should be first a thin 
slice of cold chicken, then a crisp lettuce leaf moistened with 
salad dressing, then another slice of chicken and two bits of 
bacon. Serve very hot. 

Great variety of sandwiches may be made to suit individual 
taste, and anything that is appetizing may be used. 

Boston Brown Bread Sandwiches 
Slice Boston brown bread thin and serve with a filling of 
cream cheese. 

To Cream Butter 
Butter will spread much better if it is creamed in a bowl 
with the back of a spoon. It may then be flavored with lemon 
juice or anything desired. 

Plain Lettuce Sandwiches 
Slice Graham bread thin, wash tender lettuce, dry on towel, 
place between bread and butter after seasoning with salad 
dressing. 



CHAPTER XXVII 
SOUPS 

Meat Soups 

Stock. — This is the foundation of all meat soups, and is 
made as follows: 

One pound and a half shin of beef. Cold water to cover 
(about three cups). Wipe meat with damp cloth, cut in pieces, 
brown part of meat in frying pan with a little suet. Place all 
meat in kettle with water, add one-fourth teaspoon salt and 
simmer for three hours. 

During last hour of cooking, add one small onion, one sprig 
of parsley and one-half bay leaf. 

Strain stock and cool; skim off all fat. If a clear stock 
is desired, place the skimmed stock in saucepan, add one-half 
an egg-white and half a shell broken. Boil three minutes and 
simmer fifteen, then strain. 

This skimmed and cleared stock is ready to be reheated and 
served plain with salt or with minced, cooked vegetables added, 
such as carrots, or cabbage, celery or canned peas, the amount 
to suit the taste. 

Fish Stock 

Select all parts of fish that are not edible — head, etc. — clean 
and cover with cold water, season and cook until bones sepa- 
rate from flesh. This may be the foundation of cream of fish. 
Thicken with flour and butter, season with onion, chopped 
parsley or anything preferred. 

Mutton, lamb or chicken broth are simply stock made from 
these meats, served clear and seasoned with salt and pepper. 
108 



Economical Cooking 109 

Additions 
Barley is often added to beef broth. Rice to chicken and 
mutton broth, or to chicken soup. 

Seasoning 
One secret of appetizing soup is careful seasoning. The 
successful cook must be willing to taste and taste and taste 
again, and while it is good to follow exact rules in some cook- 
ing processes, in the matter of seasonings there is an oppor- 
tunity to put real individuality into food by painstaking judg- 
ment. 

The Stock Pot 

The French have a trick of keeping a stock pot always on 
the stove, and of putting into this a few tablespoons of left 
over vegetables, or cereal, bits of toasted bread, and any savory 
food that will lend itself. This is an economical habit, and the 
American housekeeper would do well to adopt it, always sup- 
posing that she is willing to adopt also the careful French trait 
of extreme attention to detail, so that everything is exquisitely 
fresh and dainty, otherwise the stock pot may be both un- 
attractive and a menace to health. 

Oyster Soup 

y 2 pint oysters. 2 cups thin white sauce (page 32). 

Rinse oysters in cold water, remove all bits of shell. Par- 
boil in oyster liquor and add oysters and liquor to hot white 
sauce.

CHAPTER XXVIII 
SPECIAL COOKING 

For Infants, Children and Invalids 

The busy housewife often says, " I cannot prepare special 
food for anyone — all members of the "family must fare alike." 
This is wise, if she means simply to discourage selfishness and 
" f ussiness " ; but there are times when some distinctions must 
be made. 

The preparation of children's meals has already been spoken 
of (Chapter I, Part I) and this chapter will concern itself with 
the food of bottle-fed infants and with the food for sick 
persons. 

The Food of Infants 

If for any reason the mother cannot nurse the baby, the milk 
should be prepared very carefuly, and put in sterilized bottles. 

If there are any signs of illness consult a physician. If the 
child is well the following tables will be helpful, although 
everything should be done by advice of the physician. 

Modified Milk (Much Like Human Milk) 

Top milk 1 cup. Lime water 1 ounce. 

Boiled water 11 ounces. Sugar of milk... 2% tablespoons. 

Food for Child — One Year to Eighteen Months 

Breakfast. — Strained oatmeal with milk and small amount 
of sugar. 

Lunch. — Zwieback and milk. 
114 



Economical Cooking 115 

Dinner.— Soft cooked egg or broth with rice, junket or 
ustard. 
Supper. — Bread and milk. 

Children from twenty to twenty-four months may add to 
he above bread and butter, baked potato, beef juiceeand stewed, 
trained fruit. 

Cooking for Invalids 

The choosing of food for the sick should be left to the 
Dhysician or to some one who is competent to do this. In the 
preparation of the food, the same principles should be fol- 
owed as in preparing food for the well (page 29). 

A Few General Rules 
Gruels. — These are prepared from any of the cereals in 
exactly the manner described in the preparation of breakfast 
cereal, the only difference being an increased proportion of 
water, the general proportion being about one part cereal to 
six of water. 

Beef Juice 
Broil a thick piece of round steak very lightly, and squeeze 
juice out with a lemon squeezer. 

Beef Tea 
Cut two pounds round steak very fine, removing all fat, 
place in Mason jar, screw on cover, place jar in kettle of cold 
water, place on stove, and bring slowly to boiling point. Cook 
until meat is gray, pour off juice, season and serve hot. 

Scraped Beef 
With a dull knife or spoon scrape the pulp of round steak 
free from the hard fiber. Spread raw in a sandwich, or make 
into small cakes and broil. 



116 Economical Cooking 

The preparation of eggs, soups, junket, broiled meat, cocoa 
and many other processes described in this book all furnish 
advices to those who have to cook for the sick. The keynote 
of invalids' food is simplicity, and hence the one in charge 
must learn the foundation principles of good cooking. 

Brewis 

1 cup Graham bread crumbs. Milk to cover. 

Stir crumbs into milk and cook in oiled omelet pan until 
crumbs are soft. Season with salt. 

Egg and Orange 
Juice 1 orange. 1 egg. 

Beat yolk of egg into orange juice, then fold in lightly the 
stiffly beaten white. 

Egg Nog 

1 tablespoon brandy. % cup milk. 

2 teaspoons sugar. Speck of salt. 

Beat egg with brandy, sugar and salt, then stir in milk 
slowly. 

Ice Cream for One 

y 2 cup cream. 1 tablespoon sugar. 

Speck of salt. % teaspoon vanilla. 

Mix all together and freeze in small covered pail, set in 
larger pail. 



CHAPTER XXIX 
VEGETABLES 

Cooking of Vegetables 
Vegetables should always be placed in boiling salted water 
and cooked until soft. If vegetables are cooked uncovered 
their color is kept better, and in the case of strong flavored 
vegetables, such as onions or cabbage, the odor will be less 
disagreeable in the house if cooked without a cover. If vege- 
tables are soft or withered, they should be soaked in cold water 
for some time before cooking. They should always be thor- 
oughly washed and scrubbed before cooking. 

Dried vegetables should be soaked overnight if poss.ble. 
This shortens the time needed for cooking. 

Vegetables may be prepared in various ways, either raw as 
in salad or boiled and served with sauces combined with milk in 
making soups, steamed, baked or fried. 

Carrots and Peas 

1 cup carrots. * tablespoon butter. 

1 cup green peas. 

Wash, scrape and cut young carrots in small pieces and 
cook in boiling salted water until tender. Cook peas and add 
to carrots. Season with melted butter. 

Corn Oysters 

2 cupscorn (removed from cob). % ta-po^t^ 
6 tablespoons flour. 

Mix together and drop by spoonfuls on a hot greased griddle.

4 small green tomatoes. l tablespoon drippings. 

1 small onion. rtr & 

Remove skin from vegetables and cut in slices. Melt fa* 
in frying pan and place vegetables in, cooking with a cover 
until they are soft. 

Baked Potato 
Wash four medium-sized potatoes. Place in a moderately 
hot oven and bake about forty minutes. If not served as soon 
as baked, they should be pierced with a fork to allow steam 
to escape so they will not become soggy. 

Creamed Potatoes 

2 cups cold boiled potatoes. 1 cup milk. 

1 tablespoon butterine. y 2 teaspoon salt. 

1 tablespoon flour. 

Melt butter, add flour, salt and milk, stirring constantly until 
mixture boils. Boil two or three minutes and add potatoes cut 
in pieces. Any vegetable may be used in this way. 

Mashed Potatoes 

6 medium-sized potatoes. % teaspoon salt. 

1 tablespoon butterine. Few grains pepper. 

6 tablespoons hot milk. c 

Mash potatoes until all the lumps are out; add milk, butter, 
salt and pepper and beat with fork until light and flaky. 

Scalloped Onions 
Peel and boil one pint of onions; drain; add one cup of thin 
white sauce. Place in buttered baking dish and cover with 



Economical Cooking 119. 

two tablespoons buttered bread crumbs and bake on the grate 
of oven until brown. 

Note — Any vegetable may be used in place of the onions. 



Steamed Squash 

Cut winter squash in pieces and place in steamer for half 

an hour. Remove outside skiri and pass pulp through a 

strainer. To one cup of squash add — 

1 tablespoon butter. Few grains pepper. 

14 teaspoon salt. 

Heat again and serve hot. 

Stuffed Peppers 
Remove stems and inside of green peppers, being careful 
not to cut the skin; place in boiling water and boil fifteen 
minutes; remove from water, drain and fill with stuffing made 
of chopped meat, moistened bread crumbs and seasoned with 
onion juice, salt and pepper. Bake until skins are tender, 
basting with water. 

A Quick Way to Cream Vegetables 
Cut cooked vegetables in dice, dredge with flour, stirring so 
that cubes are well covered; cover with milk, add a tiny bit 
of butter, season with salt and pepper, place on stove. When 
milk begins to cook stir vegetables until the milk is smooth 
and creamy.

These foods, bread, toast, macaroni, etc., give both heat and 
Strength. It will be noticed that the only difference between bread 
and toast is in the amount of water. The protein spoken of stands 
simply for the strength-giving properties, the carbohydrate for the 
heat. The term calorie refers to the amount of energy given.

Wheat is the most useful of these, although corn has a higher 
heat value. Rice gives only heat and no strength, while rye is 
rather difficult of digestion.

This also belongs to the strength group, and the cream has most 
fat, but the whole milk is most generally useful. Buttermilk is

These are the strength foods. There is not much apparent dif- 
ference between lamb and pork chops, although lamb is much more 
wholesome. The smoked ham is not a valuable food, as the smoking 
process takes away from the strength-giving qualities. Of these 
meats, steak is the most valuable.

These foods are almost pure fat, and it will be seen that the 
caloric value is high, because fat gives a large amount of heat. Pure 
oil is one of the most wholesome of fats. The fat of bacon is also 
wholesome, and to use as shortening, beef suet is much better than 
lard, except in some cases where a soft fat is needed to give tender- 
ness, as in the case of baking-powder biscuits and pastry.

It will be noticed that the amount of water varies largely. In the 
Smoked fish, the water having been extracted, the proportion of nutri-

in some cases of weak digestion.

The careful use of pure sugar and candy is of great help in making 
a diet well proportioned, although if used to excess sugar will irritate 
the stomach and bowels. Molasses cakes are valuable for children. 
This entire group of food gives a great deal of heat to the body.

HOW TO READ THE GAS METER 

Read to the right or left as the arrow indicates and take 
the figures last passed by the hands on the dials. 

In the diagram below it would show that the dials registered 
as follows : 

The first dial 60,000 feet. 

The second dial 7,000 feet. 

The third dial 400 feet. 

You therefore began the month or term with 

Cubic Feet 

100 thousand 10 thousands thousand 

e/\°/\ A°7\ 
I 2 — ^f I I 3 z 1 

\ y* s \ / \/ ^ \ / 

Read: ten thousands thousands hundreds 

60,000 + 7,000 + 400 = 67,400 feet. 

At the end of the month or term, using the same method, it 
would read, 

Cubic Feet 

100 thousand 10 thousands thousand 

A/ % z\ h^K^ sA pa a— £ J 

Read: ten thousands thousands hundreds 

70,000 -|- 1,000 + 200 = 71,200 feet. 

and the difference between the two totals equals the amount 
(3,800 feet) of gas used.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF FUELS 
FOR THE HOUSEWIFE 

The modern housekeeper takes her high calling seriously, 
and rightly so; she looks carefully to the fuel or food needed 
to keep the bodily engines of her family in working order; 
and when this is provided, she turns her attention to the hous- 
ing of these bodies and the cooking of the aforesaid food. 

Fuel for the two latter processes is important, and can be 
made the basis of very serious study of chemistry, but the pur- 
pose of this chapter is to give only a slight working knowledge 
of the subject, an outline calculated to be of interest, and it is 
hoped, service, to the average busy housekeeper. 

It is well for such a housekeeper to consider the following 
points in the use of fuels : First, safety ; second, economy ; third, 
convenience. 

To intelligently decide as to the safety of certain fuels, it 
is necessary to have at least a slight knowledge of their com- 
position. 

In treating the subject, writers, for convenience, usually 
make the following divisions: 

Solid Fuels — coal, wood, coke, charcoal, and peat. 

Semi-solid — wax, spermaceti, paraffin. 

Liquid — alcohols and oils. 

Gaseous — natural and artificial gas. 

Electrical — 

It should be remembered that the definition of fuel is " a 
substance producing by its combustion both heat and light." 

Fuels are vegetable, animal or mineral in origin, and the 
amount of heat and light produced varies in proportion. For 
example, the materials from which candles are made, sper- 
maceti and paraffin, give light but only slight heat, the solid 
fuels give great heat and only a comparatively dim light, 
whereas the oils and alcohols give both heat and light. 
10 



146 Economical Cooking 

It is not the purpose of this brief chapter to discuss the 
nature of oxidation and combustion, but rather to concern] 
itself with the practical problems of heating and lighting. 

Considered from the standpoint of safety, the solid fuels 
head the list, while the gases, alcohols and oils need judicious 
handling, electricity is in a class by itself, and while only 
a brave person would care to wax eloquent over its origin, 
modern science does know how to render it comparatively safe 
as a fuel. 

To return to the solid fuels, coal, wood, coke, charcoal and 
peat, need only to be treated with ordinary common sense, to 
be quite safe. 

The semi-solid fuels, wax, paraffin and spermaceti, belong 
to the class that furnish light with a negligible amount of heat, 
so that one needs to preserve only precaution in keeping 
inflammable materials away from the flame of candles, com- 
prised of these substances. 

Coming to the alcohols and oils we need to exercise great 
care in adapting them to our use. 

The two kinds of alcohol used as fuel are ethyl or " ninety- 
five per cent alcohol " and " wood alcohol." They are of dif- 
ferent origin, the former is obtained by fermentation of sugar, 
the latter by " destructive distillation " of wood. Both kinds 
of alcohol burn easily, and great care must be exercised to 
keep them away from flame. This must be specially borne in 
mind when filling alcohol lamps or stoves. 

Wood alcohol has been so treated that it cannot be used for 
drinking, but its properties as a fuel have not been impaired. 

The oils come next in our outline, and we need concern 
ourselves only with those used as fuels, that is, the mineral 
oils. 

Quite within the memory of many now living whale oil 
was the one in general use, but at present kerosene has entirely 
supplanted it. 



Economical Cooking 147 

The more combustible of the mineral oils, that is, the gas- 
oline products, are very unsafe for household use, and should 
be handled only by experts when used in machinery. 

As to kerosene, the time for excessive fear of it is passed, 
since methods of refining are so improved as to render it a 
safe fuel for lamps and stoves, provided that ordinary care 
is exercised. 

Gaseous fuels are familiar to most of us, although in some 
localities not much is known of natural gas, and in fact, the 
supply is rapidly diminishing where it has been plentiful. 

In the case of artificial gas, we have a fuel that serves us 
well if we look to the piping and fixtures, but care must be 
taken to detect leaks. 

The gases most used in country districts are gasoline gas 
and acetylene gas, and of the two, the former is far less ex- 
plosive. 

We come now to a brief consideration of the relative cost of 
fuels. The simplest method will be to estimate roughly the 
fir st per hour of each. 

Coal 4 cents an hour. 

Gas 3 

Kerosene 007 " " " 

Electricity 8 " " 

Robert Coit Chapin's estimate for a four-room apartment 
for a year, is as follows: 

Coal, three tons, at $6.50 $21.00 

Wood and matches 3.00 

Gas, $2 a month in summer \ 

Gas, $1 a month in winter S 18-0 ° 

$42.00 

The estimate is, of course, for an apartment without steam 
heat, but will serve as a basis for calculation, in determining 



148 Economical Cooking 

proportion of income to be spent for the rent of steam-heated 
rooms. 

The question of convenience must be decided by individuals 
and surroundings, but generally speaking the solid fuels are 
most useful because of the lack of necessity for special pip- 
ing. Kerosene and electricity may be regarded largely as 
adjuncts. 



MANAGING A GAS RANGE 

General Rules 

1. Before lighting the match, make yourself familiar with 
all the pipes, following each pipe to the burner to which it 
belongs, so that when a key is turned you will know where to 
apply the match. 

2. To light a top burner, strike the match first, then turn 
on the gas and apply match instantly. 

3. If air gets into the pipe so that the gas burns red, turn 
off the flow, turn on again to let out the air and finally close 
the burner and let it remain closed for a moment and it is 
then ready to light. 

4. To light the oven burner, open doors, turn on the pilot 
light and apply the match ; then turn both side keys, and when 
burners are both lighted shut off the pilot light. 

5. Keep all parts of the stove clean. 

6. Keep all keys turned tight when not in use. 

7. After cooking is begun, lower the gas or use the simmer- 
ing burner if there is one; a low heat will continue the boiling 
process after it is once begun. 

8. If you have reason to suspect a leak, send for some one at 
once to attend to it.

HOUSEHOLD HINTS 

Before using mutton dripping as shortening, 
beat with a spoonful of baking powder and two 
teaspoons of lemon juice. 

If cake sticks to the pan let stand on a wet 
cloth. 

In cutting fresh bread, heat the knife blade 
to prevent crumbling of bread. 

To prevent the juice of berry pies from boil- 
ing out, clot the edge of the pie with butter. 

To take away the shine from woolen goods, 
rub gently with sand paper. 

To renovate matting, wash with strong soda 
solution, then with soap suds. 

To clean nickel, wash with warm water con- 
taining a few drops of kerosene. 

To remove stains from saucepans, boil with 
washing soda dissolved in warm water. 

To remove fruit stains, soak in hot milk. 

To remove ink, soak in sour milk if possible, 
if not, sweet milk. 

All acid should be kept in glass. 

Save tissue paper for polishing windows and 
mirrors. 

Boil cabbage without a cover and no odor will 
be noticed. 

Save gas by using a small portable tin oven 
for small bakings. 

It is good for the housekeeper to study simple 
plumbing and satisfy herself that her own is 
absolutely sanitary. 

Horizontal pipes should be as few as possible. 

Traps should be very simple in construction. 

The soil pipes should be well ventilated. Read 
'■ How to Drain a House," by George Waring 
and " Home Sanitation," by Ellen H. Richards. 






Household Hints— Continued 
Keep an old white silk handkerchief for dust- 
ing the piano. This will wash nicely and will 
not injure the finish of the piano 

Where lamps are used follow the good old- 
fashioned rule of cleaning and filling them im- 
mediately after breakfast, then danger and an- 
noyance are both avoided. 

To water a Boston fern stand the pot m a 
bowl of tepid water all night. This is far better 
than pouring on water from the top. 

Rinse all utensils which have contained milk 
in cold water before washing in hot water. It 
they are put immediately into hot water the 
particles of milk will be cooked and adhere to 

th Lef ^tm, or at least light, into bedrooms, even 
if the owners are away all day. A room that 
has been light all day is much healthier to sleep 
in than one that is shaded. 

Provide a window tent for any member ot the 
family who wishes to sleep out of doors, but who 
must adapt himself to conditions in a small 

house. 

If you have a long, narrow room, says an 
artist, furnish it in two squares, that is, have 
two square rugs rather than one long narrow 
one. The effect is vastly better. 

Select plain wall papers rather than figured 
and train the children to appreciate good pic- 
tures. Photographs and prints may be had tor 
very little money. 

In the summer cottage use the sets ot pretty 
paper napkins and doilies and thus save much 
washing. 

Use excelsior for porch cushions.
