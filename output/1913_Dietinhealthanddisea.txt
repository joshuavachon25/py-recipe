PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION. 



There have been so many changes in the o})ini()ns held by 
authorities on diet, and so many new facts have been added to 
our knowledge of foods and metabolism, that we have thought 
best to make some rather extensive alterations in this present 
edition. These have been made with a view of presenting the 
subject more clearly and to include what we regard to be the 
best of the new ideas. 

AVe have added a section on the mechanism of digestion and 
have largely rewritten the chapter on metabolism and the ])re- 
scribino; of diet. We have included some new tables which will 
be found of great practical use. The portion of the work on 
salt metabolism has also been largely rewritten, and tables 
showing the latest additions to our knowledge of this subject 
have been added. The diet in fevers in general and also of 
typhoid fever has been fully considered in new articles, and 
the sections on diabetes and gout have been entirely rewritten. 
Various new ideas and diet lists have been incorporated in the 
part of the work dealing with the diseases of the stomach and 
intestines. A number of entirely new subjects have been con- 
sidered, as duodenal alimentation and the use of the soy })ean. 
The chapter dealing with infant feeding has been thoroughly 
revised in accordance with the modern trend of thought on this 
subject. 

The advances which have been made in chemical technic and 
in the study of metabolism have made feasible investigations 
which a few years ago were impossible. These subjects have 
been helped by the newer researches in the field of the physioloiry 
of digestion. 

On the subject of the composition of foods as regards the

poromtaf^^os o'i protein, fats, carbohydrates, we already have a 
sutliclciii nuniher of i'aets for all practical purposes. This 
haviiiLT hccii accoiiipli-lu'd, the nature of the proteins have 
l)ccn studie<l and con>idcral>lc advances have been made on 
the subject ot" puriu bax's and purin inetal)olisni. Wiiile corn- 
j»l(te analy.-es ha\r not yd been made, a very fair woi king start 
i,-^ n(»\v plac<'<l in tlic liands of the o(-neral practitioner, who can 
u>e them in cbnical obx-rvations. A few years aii'O the deter- 
mination of th<' nitroi::en l)alance was regarded as a wonderful 
advance, and it was. To-day the ('(piilibrium of not only the 
nitrogen, carbon, liydrogen, and oxygen compounds, but also of 
tlie mineral element-, plio.-pliorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, 
chiorin, potassium, >odium, and sulphiu', have been studied, and 
we have ab'eady suggotions of nunimum standards of some 
ot" the.-e. In tlie Ibod-stutfs tlie percentages of these elements 
have ix'en determined, at least tentatively, as regards the total 
amount contained, [uid in tlie near i"uture we may ex])ect to see 
the exact determination of the various compounds of these ele- 
ments as they appear in the foods as eaten. 

The relation of these elements and their metabolism to disease 
is being studie<l, and a great number of sugirestive facts are 
being adde(l to our knowledge which will be of practical value 
in the neai' futui-e. The work of the laboratory and of the clin- 
ician goes hand in himd. On the one hand, explanations are 
l)fin'_: given from the results obtained in the laboratory, of facts 
lung known in ])i-actice, erroneous impressions are being cor- 
r<ci.(l, and new problems are being jiresented. This is well 
illii-ti;iied by the bi-illiaut work on diabetes and gout. On 
the (itiiei- hand, the prnet itioner checks U}) the work of the 
lab'.iatni-y, and on a large practical scah' weiLihs the new 
<'I>iiii"ri, thr new idea, and trie- the new nw'tliod. If it 
<1<)<-. not woilv practically, then; is something wrong, and the 
labor II'. i-y \\oiker nmst start anew to find out where the

The whole suhjeet oi" metaholism and il- relation to di. t. i ic>; 
reminds one somewhat of workini: out a pidiirr j»ii//lc, \\h«!f 
not only one pietin'e has Ixcn cut up into iniricatf ,-Ii;i[m-, Imt

every now and then the master mind comes alouir and Liioujt.-^

Wv may illustrate hy citini:' one or two ol' the maiiv -uu- 
U'cstive pieces of work which we ai'c perhaps not (piii^' r«adv 
to use in practi<'e, hut which open the way to newer thiiiL:-. 

'Idiere have heen some investiLTatious made of recent y<ar- on 
the more ohscure points in the relation of <iiet to metaholi-m, 
resistance, and othicr suhjects. Tliese ])oints are .-o little uiidci- 
stood tliat it is only necessary at thi< time to refer to them. l"<>r 
exam])le, lield Hunt studied the relatitui of the diet ol" white 
nn'ee to their resistance to acetonitril(>. ( 'ertain I'odds, a- oat- 
nieid, dextrose, liver, and kidney, caused an increased re-i.-tance, 
while fats, eg'gs, cheese, and inilk lowered it. 

Hunt has })roved l)y experiments on animal- that ceitain 
diets have specific effects on the thyr(»id elands in some of the 
lower animals. Oatmeal and liver were found to stimulate the 
thyroid, and it would he extremely important to know it" ihe~e 
suhstances and others, possil)ly those containini:- purin h'.die-, 
Avould he of service in cases of hy])(»tliyroidism in hmuan heiii'j-, 
and if they could he withheld to advantauc in ca-i < ot' hvperihv- 
roidism. 

Plart, ^loCollimi, Steenhock, and Iltnnphrey have made a 
series of remarkahle studies on the ell'eci of variou- ration- on 
jrrowth and reproduction. The experiment- were made on 
domestic animals, and covered several year-' time. The rati<ins

only, etc. They >eeni to have proved that there are other 
factors in diet more than merely a suilicieiit number of calories 
j)roperly halaneed, accordintr to the present chemical ideas. For 
example, there was marked dillerence in the vigor, size, and 
streriLTth of the ollspriiiij: and their capacity for milk secretion. 
Fed on wheat Inu^r the above were below normal; on corn all 
were verv vii^oroiis in all res{)eets. 

Another notable and suirucstive piece of work is the study of 
carbohvdrate tolerance niid the })ituitary body of Goetsch, Cush- 
iiiiT, and Jacobson. It is known that glycosuria occurs in some 
ca-es of acromegaly, and Horchardt in 1908 found it in 6-> 
out of 17t) cases -tudied. The first mentioned observers studied 
20 ca.-e- ot" acromegaly and gigantism, and found that they 
showed a marked in(!rease in their tolerance for carbohydrates. 
They found that in partially hypophysectionized animals there 
wa- a transient glycosuria followed by an increased tolerance 
for carbohydrates. This could be reduced to or below normal 
by the administration of the posterior lobe of the hypophysis. 
In acromegaly in the early stages the increased functioning of 
the gland <'au.-es glycosuria (posterior part) and changes in the 
bones (anterior part). In the later stages, when the secretion 
of the gland is below noruKd, there is increased tolerance for 
carboiiy(h-ates and obesity and a lowered temperature. The 
carbohydrate toh'rance seems to be closely related to the ])oste- 
rior lobe of the hypophysis, and a study of such tolerance will 
doubtless become a factor in diagnosis of hypophyseal disease. 
Thi- we think indicates another departure in dietetic studies 
which future investigation will put on a very practical basis. 

Another important lint; of work is on the acid-ibrming and 
the ba-e-f.rminii: foods. Sherman and Gettier as well as others 
ha\-e taken up this problem, and a practical study of foods in 
relcrciicc I.) amtuonia metabolism will doubtless result in some 
very u^chil therapeautic methods. \'arious fruits are often 
condemned a- being too acid, when, in realitv, thev are not 
at all -(. when viewed from the standpoint of their end-products 
in metaboli->ni.

fads which we arc eiKlcav()riii<j^ to exploit, hut have aimed to 
present the siihject of dietetics as wc; understand it. We have 
tried to sift the ever-increasing- hterature of the suhject and to 
separate the good from tlie l)ad. We liave inchided manv tahh'> 
of the composition and cak)ric vahie of foods, so that from the 
material contained in the hook one may have all that is iHM'dcd 
for going as far into the suhject as any ])ractition('r will prol)- 
ably wish. Above all, we have tried to make this the prac- 
titioner's hand-book, aiming at conciseness, clearness, and a 
common-sense presentation of the subject. AVhere no new light 
has been thrown on the subject, we have given the old empirical 
views which have found fivor in the past. 

W^e wish also to express our indebtedness to the W. J>. 
Saunders Co. for their uniform courtesy and consideration.

PREFACE. 



This book lias been prepared to meet the needs of iIk; 
general praetitloner, hospital interne, and medical student, as 
well as i'or a reference handbook for trainini2;;-sch(H)ls. 

The aim of the book is entirely ])racti(;al. A\'c have en- 
deavored to ii:ive a reasonably concise acconnt of the dill'ereiil 
kinds of foods, their composition and nses, and also to set f(»rtli 
the ])rinci[)les of diet both in health and disease. The greater 
])art of the book is devoted to the sick, and we have tried lo 
tell the doctor how to feed his patient. We have i^onv oxer the 
literature of the subject, much of which is inaccessible to the 
general practitioner, and have given what seems to us to be the 
most useful. We trust that the book is simple enough to be 
used for rapid reference by the busy practitioner, and that tliere 
is sutficient detail to make the way clear for the medical student 
and the uninitiated hospital interne. \\(' have gathered to- 
gether many diet-lists and reci]K\s, which we trust ^\ill be of 
service both to the physician and to the nurse. 

In the preparation of this work we have consulted many 
books and journal articles, and wx' are under obligation to the 
many authors wdiose names are mentioned throughout the book 
in connection with their contributions to the science ol' dietetic^. 

We are especially indebted to Dr. W. O. Atwater and his 
collaborators f )r much valuable material. We wish to ex])re>s 
our thanks to the publishers, Messrs. AV. 1). Saunders cV Co., 
for the courtesv thev have shown in its jtrepa ration.

Diet in Health and Disease. 



THE CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF 
DIGESTION. 

Food is the matter that is taken into the body to supply 
nourishment or to replaee tissue- waste. Every j)hysieal act 
consumes a part of the force that has ])een derived from food. 
The raaintenauce of the body-heat consumes auother part, and 
in growing individuals a certain amount is utilized in building 
up the new tissues. 

Food as it is taken into the body differs very nuieh in com- 
position from the material that can be ntilized in cell-growth 
and in replacing the tissue-w^aste. The function of digestion is 
so to alter the food that it may be absorbed by the blood, and 
prepare it for assimilation and utilization by the various tissues. 
The food of mankind is most varied in nature, differing with 
the seasons, and with climates, races^ and countries. 

The study of foods is a most complex one, and until recently 
few scientific investigations along this line had been made. 
Fortunately, however, experiments are now being carried on 
the world over, and it is to be ho])ed that the sul)iect of diet in 
health and in disease will soon be lifted out of the vale of em- 
piricism wdiere it has so long rested. 

The chemic elements of wTiich the body is comj^osed are sim- 
ilar to those contained in the food-stuifs generally em])loyed. 
Of the fifteen or twenty elements contained in the body the 
principal ones are oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, 
phosphorus, and sul])hur. These and others that are j)resent in 
small quantities form a large number of com])ounds. In foods 
these com})ounds are most conveniently grou])ed under the head- 
ings of protein, fats, carbohydrates, mineral matter, and water. 
Although various classifications are in use, this one, owing to its 
simplicity, is that generally adopted. 



18 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

Water. — Water enters into the eomposition of every tissue 
in the body and forms more than 60 jier cent, of the entire, 
body-weight of a full-grown man. As it is not burned iiji 
in the metabolic processes, it does not, however, furnish any 
energy. 

Salts. — The earthy salts, which form about 6 per cent, of 
the body-weight of an adult man, furnish little if any energy. 
They are most abundant in the bones and teeth, but they also 
enter into the composition of other tissues and fluids of the 
bodv. The })rinci[)al salts of the body are calcium phosphate 
and the various compounds of potassium, sodium, magnesium, 
and iron. The mineral salts are very necessary to life and 
liealth. 

Protein. — Under this heading are included most of the 
nitrogenous food-compounds. A'arious terms have been applied 
to this class of foods, the terminology here employed being that 
recommended by the American Association of Agricultural Col- 
leges and Experiment Stations. 

Protein is found in both animal and vegetable food, familiar 
exani])les of it being the lean and gristle of meat, the white of 
i'gi:, and the gluten of grain. Proteins are divided into albu- 
minoids, gelatinoids, and extractives. 

Albuminoids include such substances as the white of eg^', 
the lean j)art of meat, the curd of milk, and the gluten of 
wheat. 

Gelatinoids (called albuminoids by some writers) occur 
chieliy in the connective tissues, as the " collagen " of tendons 
and -kin and the ossein of the bones. Gelatin is a familiar 
example of this class of ])roteins. 

Tlie extractives contain nitrogen, but differ widely from 
both allniriiin'tids iu\<\ gelatinoids. They are the principal con- 
stituent- (if beet-t<'a and ment-extracts. Vegetables contain <u\)- 
stanee< known :i- aniids — for example, asparagin — which have 
similar jiroperiie-. 

T\h- protein-, especially the albmninoids, are of the greatest 
importance t<» the animal (conomy. Thev help to build uj) new 
tis-;ues and to repair the waste of the old; they are also burnt 
up in the IxkIv, and are imj)oi-tant as a source of energy and of 
heat. r^irther, they may be converted into fat and storci^l in 
the body f )r future u-e, this la.-t function, however, being of 
minor importance. 

IVoteins form an e.-sential part of the diet, for without them, 
or when tliey are supplied in too small (juantity, the body

wastes and a condition of* nialiuitrition supervenes, (arlxilis- 
drates and fats can not replace {)roteins. As will he >lio\\ii iiir- 
ther on, they may, by supplying a source of heat and enei-w;\ , 
protect the protein material, hut tliey can not fulfil the function 
of repairing or building up tissues, with the excej)ti<)n dl' iatlv 
tissue. Plants diifer from animals in that the Ibriner can build 
np their structure largely on non-])rotein substances and derive 
their nitrogen su})ply directly from salts. 

The gelatinoids are of complex com])o>ition, and e\id(ntlv 
can not be used as albuminoids in the growth and repaii' (•!' 
the body. They appear to have a Ibod-value similar to that 
of the carbohydrates and fats. The extractives are probabK- 
of no value either as a source of energy or in the formation oi' 
tissues. They act as stimulants and as a{)])eti/ers, and it has 
been stated that the craving some individuals have f )r meat is, 
in reality, a desire for the extractives. 

Carboliydrates contain no nitrogen. They are compo-e*! 
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the last two in the proportion 
to form water — as, for example, starch or dextrose, Cyij,(). ; 
hence the name, carbohydrates. They include the starches, the 
sugars, and vegetable fiber or cellulose. Carbohydrates are 
burnt up in the body, and their energy is changed into heat or 
used up in muscular work ; they may also be converted into 
fat and be stored nj) iu the body. The superficial fitty tis^ue 
of the body serves as a direct protection against cold and as a 
storehouse for lieat and energy. Starch forms only about 1 per 
cent, of the body-weight. The carbohydrates, on account of 
their easy digestion and availability, jire the mo-t prolific source 
of heat and energy. 

F'at, or hydrocarbon, is an important element of food, serv- 
ing the same purpose as the carbohydrates, but more valuable 
weight for weight as a source of energy than the latter, but 
being neither so easily digested nor so available. Fat is found in 
animal foods, such as meat, fish, and butter, in vegetable iiiod.-, 
as oils, in the various cereals, and in the kernels of nuts. Taken 
as food in excess of the needs of the organism, fit is usually 
stored in the fatty tissue. It forms about 15 ])C'r cent, ol' the 
weight of an average man, but there are wide variations in 
health. Apart from the effects of certain diseases, the ten- 
dency toward leanness or toward the accumulation of fit is de- 
pendent upon personal habit, heredity, etc., more than upon the 
quantity or quality of the food taken. Individuals with a ten- 



20 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

dency to take on fat become stouter on being overfed and on 
taking too little muscular exercise. 

P^bstein maintains that the ingestion of fat is a factor in 
preventing nui.-cular fatigue. It is said that during the 
Franco-Prussian War, with this end in view, the German 
Emperor ordered that each soldier receive 250 grams of fat 
bacon a dav. 



DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION. 

DIGESTION. 

In order that it may be used by the body food must be 
diL^('st('(l, and this |)rof'css of digestion is a complicated one. 
It mi>L:ht ahnost be said to begin before the food is eaten, as it 
i- irreatlv infhienced bv appetite, smell, sight, and the sur- 
n)undin<r-. The-e subject^ will be mentioned more fully later 
o!i. Good inod prepared in a skilful manner, pleasant to see, 
to .-mell, and to taste, taken in comfortable surroundings with 
cheerful comj)anions, will be digested with ease by normal indi- 
vidiiab, wliile the reverse of all or any of these may cause 
indiLTe-iioii due to tlu,' mental action upon digestion — chiefly, 
perhap-, on the diLfe-tive glands. Pawlow has made a most 
fa-einatiiig ,-tudy of this subject, to which the reader is 
ref-rrtd.' 

The Passage of Food Through the Alimentary 
Tract. — The fir.-t step in the digestion of food is mastication, 
which is perha])s the only purely voluntary act connected with 
th<' pr<)('e>^. J^,- this means the food is ground to a fine ])ulp 
and ili'»roughly iinxed with saliva. It is necessary to have 
'^mA t'-''ih, and the importance of tlie care and preservation of 
th'' \i-i'\\\ cainiot be too strongly insisted U]X)n. Defective teeth 
are a iix-iiace to health, a- tliey lead to the food being im])er- 
{'i-r\\y i!ia-iicatr'd, and the constant absor{)tion of toxic material 
may a;l" ct i)<,tli diLre-tion and the general health. In the proc- 
(■-- of clpw iii<r the inu-ele- of the cheeks and lips serve to keep 
the fbt.il ill ihe line of the teeth, and when the facial nmscles

lowed the food must be moist and on the toni^uo, and it is difh- 
eult or impossible to swaHow dry Ibod. Li(|uid or \i-vv soft 
food may pass directly into the stomach in as little as 0.1 sec- 
onds, but semisolid and solid food are i'orced down the esoph- 
agus by a sort of peristaltic movement, taking as long as six sec- 
onds to reach the stomach. There may be a delav ol" from lour 
to eight seconds at the cardiac sphincter. Paralv>Is of the sol't 
palate causes the food to be regurgitated through the nose wlicn 
swallowing is attempted, and if the nmscles oi" the pliarvnx or 
larynx are ])aralyzed the food may be as{)irat('(l inio tli(,' tniclica, 
bronchi, or lung, and so set U]) a bronchopneumonia. 

Food remains in the stomach until it has been reducu'd to 
more or less of a liquid, when it is forced through the ])vl<.rus 
from time to time. Our kncnvledge of g;!stric movements dates 
from the classic experiments made on Alexis St. ]\Iartin bv 
Beaumont, and a great deal of research has been devoted to the 
subject in recent years. The fundus of the stomach acts as a 
reservoir for the food, Avhile the pyloric end serves to grind 
and macerate it until it is forced out of the stomach into the 
duodenum, the pylorus apparently opening under the stinuilus 
caused by the combination of tlie food being li(piid in character 
and acid in reaction. In the duodenum the acid cau>es the 
pylorus to close. The order in w4iich the f)()d is digested 
depends somewhat on the order in which it is ingested and the 
amount of fluid taken with it. For example, if carboh.ydrates 
are fed first and then proteins, the carbohydrate })asses almo-t 
immediately into the small intestine; if, however, the protein 
is fed first, the carbohydrate remains in the stomach mucli 
longer. 

Hedbloom and Cannon have summarized the results of their 
investigations on the passage of f)od from the stomach as 
follows : 

If carbohydrate food is thinned by adding water, there is, 
within limits, very little change in the rate of exit from tlie 
stomach ; but adding water to protein food tends to make the 
discharge more rapid. When hard particles are ])resent in tlu^ 
food, the rate of outgo from the stomach is notably retarde*!. 
Coarse, branny food leaves the stomach slightly fister tluui simi- 
lar foods of finer texture. The presc^nce of gas in the stomach 
delays gastric discharge, an effect due to the gas preventing the 
walls of the stomach from exerting the normal mixing and pro- 
pelling action on the food. Xo considerable variation from the 
normal rate of exit from the stomach is observed when the food 



22 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

is fed very hot or very cold. Food with approximately normal 
acidity leaves the stomach much fa^^ter than food which is 
hyperacid (1 })er cent.), a result in harmony with other obser- 
vations on the acid control of the pylorus. Feeding acid food 
is followed by deep and rapid peristalsis. Massage of the 
stomacii, even when extensive, has very slight influence on the 
passage of food through the pylorus. Irritation of the colon 
(with croton oil) notably retards gastric discharge, and delays 
the movements of f )od through the small intestine. 

In the intestine the food is moved forward by the peristaltic 
movements; a wave of relaxation moves along the intestine fol- 
lowed bv a wave of contraction and this serves to pass the con- 
tents of the bowel downward. .Reverse peristalsis may occur 
in normal conditions, and especially in injury or disease of the 
intestines, a< in intestinal obstruction. In addition to this gen- 
eral movement tliere are local rhythmic movements occurring 
at the })arts of the intestine occupied by food. The mass to be 
digested is sej)arated into numerous small masses by this move- 
ment, anil then these are swept together and also onward by 
the wave of peristalsis. The length of time that a meal takes 
to pas- iVoni the stomach to the large bowel varies, but it is 
about tour hours on an average, and the first part of the meal 
may be at the ileocecal valve by the time the last of it leaves 
the stomach. Various things may upset the movements* of the 
intestines. A sudden disturl)ance of circulation in the bowel 
may cause violent movements, and dysjmea may either increase 
the movements or stop them altogether. The organic acids 
formed in the bowel as the result of the bacterial action act as 
stimulants to intestinal movement. 

The movement through the large intestine is slow, as it is 
there that most of the water is absorbed. The passage of the 
inte.-linal e(>ntents is delayed in the ascending colon by reverse 
})eri-tahie movements. According to the observations of Hertz 
the feee- take two liours on an average to pass from the ileo- 
cecal v.ilve to the hepatic flexure, and about four and a half 
hours to pa-s rr<»m there to the splenic flexure, fi'om whence the 
{i'cc- are inoveil -lowly to the sigmoid flexure. The rectum is 
])rob;ibly empty until ju.-t before d(;fecation, and the entrance 
of feee> into the reetnm probably excites the desire. The rec- 
tum i- elo-ed by the internal and external sphincters, the latter 
beini: partly under the control of the will. Defecation is i)artly 
a voluntary and p;ii-tly an involuntarv action.

cliemic cliangcs brought al)<)ut in tlie alirnciitarv ti'ad l»v the 
action of certain unorganized ferments usually known a> en-

alterations in the physical properties ol' tlu; lood, tin; two com- 
bined allowing the useful ])art to be assimilated while the I'c- 
mainder passes oft' as refuse. 

l^n^ymes. — Enzymes ar(^ the products oi' protoplasmic 
changes, and are not endowed with lil'e. They arc complcx 
uitrogenous stibstances, the exact chemic natur(.> of which has 
not been determined. Howell makes the Ibllowlug cl;i-<i- 
fication : 

1. Proteolytic enzymes, or those acting u])on ])rot('ins, con- 
verting them into a soluble substance — peptone or ])roteosc. In 
animals the pepsin of the gastric juice and the f/-i/jj.s/it oi' the 
pancreatic juice are examples of this class. .V similar enz\-me 
is foinid in plants, in the pineapple family (^bromelin) and in 
the papaw (papain). 

2. Amylolytic enzymes, or those acting upon starches, con- 
verting them into soluble forms — sugar or sugar and dextrin. 
As examples of this class we have, in the animal body : in th(} 
saliva, ptyalin ; in the pancreatic juice, amylopsin ; and in the 
liver, one capable of converting glycogen into sugar. In plants 
there is a similar enzyme, knowm as diastase. 

3. Fat-splitting enzymes, or those acting upon the neutral 
fats, splitting them up into glycerin and the corresponding 
fatty acid. Steapsin, present in the pancreatic juice, is an 
example of this class. Similar enzymes occur in a number of 
seeds. 

4. Sugar-splitting enzymes, or those having the ])ro}ierty 
of converting the dotible into the single sugars — the disacchar- 
ids, such as sngar-cane and maltose, into the monosaccharids, 
as dextrose and levidose. Two such enzymes are f )und in the 
small intestine. One of these acts on cane-sugar, and is known 
as invertin or invertase ; whereas the oth(>r acts on maltose, and 
is known as maltase. Other enzymes split the monosaccharids, 
as one found in the tissues capable of changing the blood and 
tissue sugar (dextrose) into lactic acid. 

5. Coagulating enzymes, or those acting upon soluble pro- 
teins, precipitating them in an insoluble form. Kennin, the 
milk-curdling ferment of the gastric juice, is an example ol' this 
class of enzymes. 

6. Oxidizing Enzymes or Oxidases. — These set up oxida- 
tion processes. They are found in the various organs and 
tissues.

a tenijK'ratin'c of from 60° to 80° C, and their action is re- 
tarded or entirely suspended by low tem])enitures, — c. </., by 
iVee/iuLT, — without, Itowever, actually destroying the enzyme. 
'J1i( y are cliaracterized further by the fact that after a certain 
(leLTee of change has been aifected the products of their activity 
prevent i'urther action, so that most of them may be said to 
l)e iueomjilete in this res{)ect. 

Another ein-ious fact is that the activity of an enzyme is 
not in proj)()rti(»ii to the amount present. A trifling (juantity 
may elVeet enormous change, and increasing the amount of 
enzyme augments the change ])roduced, but oidy to a certain

be added. An enzyme cannot be used over and over a^ain, 
as it is altered in some way and so rendered ineaj)al)le of 
indefinite action. 

It is commonly believed tliat enzymes eflect tluMr eliaiiLres l.v 
hydrolysis; tliat is, tliey cause the substance acted upon to take 
up one or more molecules of watei-, the result beinir tliat tlic

How this chang'e is brouo^ht about is not known. 

AVith this ])reliminary considcM'ation <tf the enzymes we may 
now proceed to the study of di<restion. 

Salivary Digestion. — When food is taken into the mouth 
and masticated, there is a stimulation of the secretory nerv< - 
which results in a flow of saliva, which is the combined secre- 
tion of the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual <j^lands, tooetlier 
with that of the mucous glands of the mouth. It is usually col- 
orless, ropy, and stringy, due to the presence of mucin, of a 
weakly alkaline reaction, and has a specific gravity oi" 1. ()();]. 
It acts best in a weakly alkaline medium. The digestive fer- 
ment which it contains is called ptyalin. Perhaps the chief 
use of saliva is to soften the food and to act as a lubricant. 
The thorough moistening of the food ensures its being ea^ilv 
swallowed. The amount of digestion that takes ])lace in the 
mouth is small, owing to the short time the f )od remains there, 
but the action of the saliva is, under certain conditions, continued 
in the stomach. Mastication not only divides the food, l>nt 
stimulates the flow of saliva, and this in turn moistens the ftod 
and permits it to be tasted. The taste of food further stinuui- 
latcs the secretion of saliva. 

Ptyalin, the digestive enzyme, acts upon starches by a hydro- 
lytic cleavage process, converting them into sugar and dextrin. 
The exact chemical process through which the starch molecule 
goes has not been definitely decided upon, but the f )llowing 
scheme is most generally accepted : 

btarch -( T^ ^1 ] , • f Maltose. 

( Achroudextrin. 

The presence of starch being evidenced by its blue color when 



26 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

brouglit into contact with iodin, ervtlirodextrin red, and achro- 
odextrin colorless. 

Until late years it was thought that the digestion of starches 
in the stomach was quite insignificant, because of the fact that 
acid not only inhibits but destroys ptyalin. Since the .r-ray 
W(ji-k of such investigat(jrs as Cannon and Herz we know this 
c<)nce])tion to be erroneous, as they have shown the layer forma- 
tion of f )()d as it enters the stomach, whereby the last to be 
rcc('iv('<l is })rotected from the acid secretion of the fundic por- 
tion, thus delaying for a considerable time (forty to ninety min- 
utes) the contact of acid with ptyalin, and, therefore, salivary 
digc.-tion is cai'ried on to a considerable degree before being in- 
terfered with by the gastric juice. Raw starch is acted upon 
very slowly, whereas in well-cooked starch sugar may be de- 
tectetl after even one minute. This is due to the fact that the 
starch granules are surrounded by an envelope of vegetable 
fiber (cellulose) that protects it from the action of the ferment. 
On boiling, this cellulose covering is broken, and the starch is 
not only liberated, but also takes up water, rendering it easy of 
digestion. (See section on Cooking.) 

Gastric Digestion. — We are indebted to Pawlow for a 
great amount of pioneer work concerning the nature of digestive 
processes. It ^vas he who established the flict of psychic secre- 
tion, which we now know to be a most important factor in di- 
gestion. The first stimulus of gastric secretion originates in the 
mouth, and this causes the first flow of gastric juice, when the 
furtherance of the flow depends upon the action of what we 
know as secretagogues. Some foods contain substances that 
have the power to cause secretion of gastric juice when taken 
into the stomach; for example, meat extract and meat juices. 
This clcnient is present to a much l{\ss extent in milk, Avhile 
bread and white of egg liav<' practically no efrect at all. 

Howell gives three steps in the mechanism of secretion : (1) 
Psyohical .-<'erction \ {'1) Secretion from secretagogues contained 
in the finxl ; {:\) The secretion from secretagogues contained in 
th<' products of dig<',-tion. 

Ivlkins is of the opinion that the secretagogues, whether pres- 
ent in tlie food oi- forrjied during digestion, act upon the pyloric; 
mucous menil)rane and ibrm a substance which he designates as 
gastric secretin, aiui this sub-taiice after absor])tion into the 
bloo(l is carried to the ga-ti-ic glands and stimulates them to 
x'cretion. 

N'arious foods proihice gastric s(>cretion of varying digestive 



DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION. 27 

qualities; for instance, that i^roduced hy bread is less in (juan- 
tity but of greater digestive })()wer than that pi'oihiecd by inent. 
The juice })roduced by psychic stiinuhition is always ol' the siuiic 
quality. 

(i(tst)'lc juice is a thin, colorless, strongly acid li(|ui(l, with a 
speciiic gravity of about 1.0(12. Its most important con.-litucnt- 
are hydrochloric acid, pe})sin, rennin, and lipase. 

Pepsin is a proteolytic enzyme ac^ting onl\- in acid media. It 
is present in the cells as a zymogen, and is not changed to the 
active pepsin until after secretion. The process of peptics diges- 
tion is usually acce})ted as follows : 

Protein. 

Acid albumin (syntonin). 

Primaiy proteoses ( protalhmnoses). 

Secondary proteoses (deutcru-alhumoses). 

Peptone. 

The whole process seems to be one of hydrolytic cleavage of the 
protein molecule, with peptone as the final stages as far as gas- 
tric digestion is concerned. All changes wrought by the digest- 
ive ferments on the food-stuffs are hydrolytic. Eecently it has 
been stated that if time enough is given to the action of pepsin 
it will break the protein molecule as completely as after the 
action of trypsin, or after hydrolysis by acids. 

Beniiin is the enzyme of the gastric juice which has to do 
with the curdling of milk. It is present in the cells of the gas- 
tric tubules in the form of a zymogen, being converted into an 
active enzyme in the presence of acid. The action upon human 
milk causes the formation of loose flocculi, while the curd formed 
by its action on cows' milk is more solid and of firmer consist- 
ency. 

Fats undergo simply a physical change in the stomach, the 
chemical action upon them being effected by the intestinal 
juices. 

Intestinal Digestion. — When the food has been ])assed 
into the small intestine, it is acted on sinudtaneously by three 
secretions — the pancreatic juice, the intestinal juice, ami the bile. 
Although these secretions, as stated, act together, f )r the .-ake 
of simplicity each will be considered separately. 

Pancreatic Juice. — Our knowledge of the functions of the 
pancreatic juice is obtained largely from experiments made on 
the lower animals. In man it enters the intestine together with 
or closely following or preceding the bile, being mixed with the 
latter secretion and the f x'd-material at the same time. It is 



28 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

alkaline in reaction, and contains at least three, and probably- 
more, enzymes — viz., trypsin, amylopsin, steapsin, and, it is 
said, a milk-curdling ferment similar to rennin. 

Aceordinir to Pawlow, the amounts of the various ferments 
in the ])anereatic juiee varies with the nature of the food taken, 
starcliv food causing an increase in the amylopsin, and so forth. 
Tlicsc statements have not been fully confirmed as yet by other 
(ib.-('r\-(i-s. Pawlow has also shown that the presence of bile 
douhhs the activity of the digestive juices. 

Tr>ij)siii. — Try])sin is a more active ferment than is pepsin, 
and acts in alkaline, neutral, or even in slightly acid media. It 
i- most active, however, in alkaline solutions. The process by 
wliicli jtcptoncs are formed from proteins is similar to that of 
pcjdic digestion, hut diifers somewhat in detail. Trypsin, how- 
ever, is ca})able of carrying on the digestion of peptones further 
than is pepsin. The steps of the process consist in separating 
tlie peptone into an (iiif/pcpfone, a peptone that can not l)e acted on 
fnrtiier l)y the ferment, and Jtemipepfoue, which is split up into 
various simpler sul)stances, such as amido-acids and nitrogenous 
b:i-es. Among these simpler substances are leucin and tyrosin. 
Just what role these end-products play in the animal economy 
has not been definitely determined. They do not replace tissue- 
waste, and are less useful sources of energy than is peptone 
itself, which is absor1)ed as such and utilized by the body.

especially as a lare^e part of the licat and cuvv^v consumed hy

Steapsin, known also as lipase, splits up the neutral fats into 
glycerin and free fatty acids. This emulsifi(^ation is ol" para-

There are two views concerning the absorption of fat. The 
older view is that the fat splits or is saponilied onlv to a sinall 
extent, the larger part of it being emulsilied by the iatly acids 
formed during the splitting-up process. This cnnilsilicd fat is 
then directly absorbed as neutral fat. The view more recently 
adopted is that all the fat is split u]> into glycerin and fatty 
acids, whether or not emulsification has previously occurred. 
The fatty acids are saponified by the action of the alkaline salts 
in the intestine, the })roducts being then absor})ed, and brought 
into combination again to form a neutral fat. This recombina- 
tion may occur in the epithelial cells of the intestine. As the 
action of lipase is reversible, that is, may s])lit up the fats or it 
may cause synthesis of the split })roducts. lipase is found in 
many tissues of the body, as liver, muscle, and mammaiy glands. 
It is possible that fat is split and re-formed many times in the 
processes of nutrition. 

Emulsification takes place more rapidly in the jM'csence of 
bile and pancreatic fiuid than in the presence of pancreatic iliiid 
alone. Although bile itself causes no enuilsilication, it aids 
very materially in the })rocess. 

Intestinal Secretion. — This is the secretion of the inte-tinal 
glands, the crypts of Lieberkiihn. It is strongly alkaline iVoiii 
the presence of sodium carbonate, and this may aid in the emul- 
sification of fat. Otherwise the intestinal secretion probably 
lias no action on the ]n*oteins oi- fats. The secreiion and the 
walls of the small intestines contain three ferments which act 
npon carbohydrates. These are invertase, which acts upon cane- 
sugar ; maltase, which acts ujion maltose and dextrin, and lac- 
tase, wdiich acts u])on lactose. The walls of the intestines con- 
tain also erei)sin and enterokinase. KrepHin ])robably c(^ntinues 
or supplements the changes begun by tryj^sin. It is sup])o-ed 



30 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

to act upon the (Icutcro-albiimoses and peptones. Erepsin has 
been found by Vernon in all the tissues of the body. It is 
present in the kidneys in greater quantities than in the intesti- 
nal mucosa. Enferohinasf acts upon the pancreatic juice. Apart 
from tlie small intestine the pancreatic juice has no digestive 
action on proteins. The explanation of this is that the juice 
contains a substance, trypsinogen, capable of being converted 
into try})sin by the action of enterokinase. As soon as the pan- 
creatic juice comes in contact with the intestinal wall the pre- 
viously inert trypsinogen is changed into the very active ferment, 
try])-in. 

Sec red n. — This is not an enzyme, but a definite chemical com- 
])ouiid. It Is secreted by the wall of the small intestine when 
acid- arc brought in contact with it. Secretin is supposed to be 
absorbed by tlie blood, and being thus carried to the pancreas, 
excites the .-ecrction of the pancreatic juice. As we descend 
the inte.-tiual tract tlie quantity of enzymes contained in the in- 
testinal secretion l)ecomes smaller. The large intestine secretes 
mucus but no enzymes. 

Bacterial Changes. — The changes produced by bacteria are 
an extremely importimt factor in digestion, especially from the 
pathologic stand])oint. The subject can not, however, be entered 
upon fully here, and for a complete knowledge the student 
should consult tlie sjiecial text-books on bacteriologv. For our 
prc-ciit purpose it is sutlicient to say that, in the small intestine, 
bactci'ial changes are probably limited to the carbohydrates. 
Under abnormal conditions, or when excessive quantities of 
protein f >od are taken, jiutrefaction of the proteins may occur. 
In the large intestine, however, the extreme alkalinity over- 
comes this acidity, and allows ])utrefaction of the feces to take 
plac". The pioducts of liactei'ial action jire many, and consist 
of Ifiicin, t\ To-ill, phenol, skatol, and various acids and gases. 
Some (.f tlic-c, after having undei'gone certain changes, are ab- 
sorb<-d and excreted again in the urine. It is not definitely 
known ju-t \\h;it p:irt they ])lay m the nutrition of the Ixxly. 
Jii<lgirig iVom the experiments of Xuttall, it is reasonably cer- 
t;iin, however, that bacterial action is not essential to nutrition. 

I/iver. — The liver plays an important part in the nutrition 
of the body. Thi- importance is due largely to the l)ile whicli 
it secrete-, and which is an adjuvant to intestinal digestion, and 
to the action of the liver-cells (.n the absorlied food-material as 
it is ibund in th<' portal circuhition. 



DIGESTIOy AM) AJiSORPTIOX. 31 

The bile contains bilc-})io:nK'nts, 1)I1(' acids (olvcoclK.lic ;iii<l 
taurocholic), cholcslerin, Iceitliin, iats, and iniclcd-alhuiuiii. 

The function of tlie bi/c-jjif/nicnfs is ohx-inc. Kxidcntlv 
they are waste-products of inetabolism. Tlic /ji/c arUis aiv 
believed co play an important piiysiolo^ic role. 'Y\\v\ dis- 
solve the cliolesterin and facilitate the absorption (.1" Iats. 
Cholesterin is regarded as a waste-])r(>duct ibrnied in various 
tissues, and is excreted by the liver-cells, as well a< bv the 
skin glandSj and the mammary gland. LvciUiin is also a wa.-te- 
product. Antiseptic properties have been ascribed to the bile, 
a property that has never been demonstrated. When a biHarv 
fistula occurs and the bile is diverted from the intestine, the 
feces are very light in color and give off a ietid odor, especiallv 
if large quantities of meat and fat are taken. The antiputre- 
factive action of the bile is probably an indirect one. In those 
patients in whom the supply of bile is cut off from the intes- 
tine a considerable amount of undigested and unabsorbed foo<l 
passes through the intestine. It has been proved, however, 
that in healthy animals the entire supply of bile may be 
diverted and the animals still continue healthy, which shows 
that the functions of the bile can, to a certain extent, be 
replaced. The bile also helps to arrest peptic digestion in the 
intestine. 

Glycogen. — One of the most important functions of the 
liver is the so-called glycogenic function. In 1857 Claude 
Bernard demonstrated the presence of glycogen in the li\'er. 
Glycogen is soluble in water, and has the same general chemic 
formula as starch. Toward digestive juices it also behaves 
like starch, and the end-products are the same as in the case 
of starch, namely, maltose and dextrin. Glycogen is connnonly 
known as animal starch. AVith iodin it gives a recKlish instead 
of the blue color of ordinary starch. Glycogen is elaborated 
by the liver and can be demonstrated in the liver-cells. It 
occurs in greatest quantity after meals, and decreases with 
fasting. After prolonged fasts it may disa]>}H'ar altogether. 
The carbohydrates aid directly in the formation of glycogen. 
These reach the liver in the form of dextrose and levidose, and 
are converted into glycogen by the abstraction of a molecule 
of water. Lactose is not so easily changed, and if given in 
excessive quantities, can be demonstrated in the urine, which 
shows that it has not been utilized. During infancy, however, 
lactose, or milk-sugar, forms an important addition to the diet, 



32 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

and is used up in tlic body in inconsiderable quantities. 

Glycogen may be formed directly from proteins, a process 
that occurs pathologically in diabetes. According to some authors, 
fat cannot be converted into «;lycogen ; others, however, believe 
that, under certain pathologic conditions, this may take place. 

The function of glycogen has been a matter of much dis- 
pute. Ik'rnard's view was that it furnishes a means of storing 
U{) the sugars until they are needed, the glycogen being con- 
verted into sugar (dextrose) and taken up by the blood. The 
same amount of sugar is found in the blood whether the indi- 
vidual is fasting or is living on protein food. If the amount 
of sugar in the blood exceeds a certain percentage, it is ex- 
creted by the kidniys. According to some authors, glycogen 
is changed into (lextr(jse by the acti(m of an enzyme. 

Glycogen is also found in the muscles, stored up, in all proba- 
])illty, f )r inune(liate use. The difference that exists between 
the jiiuscle and liver supj>]ies of glycogen may be compared to 
thi' ditl'i rence between retail shops, where material is sup])lied 
inmi(Mli;it(ly to the consimier, and the warehouses, where it is 
stored in large ([uantities. The glycogen in the muscle is 
oxidi/e<l ;iud its (juergv converted into muscular force. 

Urea and the Liver. — Another function of the liver is the 
formation of ui'ea. After the nitrogenous elements have been 
<'i)iisuiii<(l as a source of tissue-su})ply and energy, they are 
eliminated fmni the body, ])rincipally by the kidneys, in the 
form of urea. Tliat urea is formed in the liver has been 
pro\'c(l ex pei'i mentally. 

PECULIARITIES OF THE DIGESTION IN INFANTS*

su'-king. ir tlier<' is any defect of the lips or ol' the palate, or

In infants gastric digestion is probably of no very great 
importance. In the very yonng the stomach acts chieflv as a 
reservoir from which the food is passed into the intestine. 
The length of time the food remains in the infant stomacii 
increases with the age of the child. Holt states that in liealthy 
breast-fed infants one month old the stomach is found (^m])ty 
at the end of an hour or an hour and a half after nursing. 
When fed u])on cows' milk, the food remains, on an average, 
half an hour longer. In infants from two to eight m(mths old 
the food remains somewhat longer — two hours f )r breast-fed 
and two and one-half to three hours f>r bottle-fed })abies. 
Gastric digestion is prolonged in all cases where there is any 
derangement of digestion. The milk, however, begins to 
leave the stomach verv soon after feeding, and continues to do 
so gradually until it has all passed into the inti'stine. 

Pepsin is present in the infant stomach at birth. The reac- 
tion of the stomach-contents is acid, depending on the presence 
of hydrochloric acid, and in early infancy of lactic acid as 
well. 

Rennin plays an important part in infant digestion. It 
coagulates mother's milk in loose flakes, whereas cows' milk is 
coao-ulated in largfc masses. This fact must be borne in mind 
in feeding cows' milk to young infants, and the milk should be 
so modified as to prevent curdling in large masses. 

Intestinal Dig-estion. — The starch-digesting ferment of 
the pancreas is not very active during early life. In amount 
and power it seems to correspond largely to pytalin.

34 CHEMISTRY AXD PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

Absorption differs somewhat in infants, depending on 
whether they are l)rea.-t or bottle fed. In breast-fed infants 
from 2 to o per cent, of the proteins and fats pass directly 
through the iiite.-tiue. In bottle-fed babies, Uffelman states 
that the residue i- from 1 to 3 per cent, more for the fats, 
whereas for the ])n)teins there is a still greater increase. 

Xumcrons bacteria are ])re-ent in the intestines of infants, 
and while tlicy may play some ]mrt in the digestive process, it 
i- (.tic on which neither life nor health depends. 

Tobacco and Digestion. — Tobacco frequently plays an 
im[)ortant role in influencing the digestion of food. It is a well- 
known fact that the chewing of tobacco increases the salivary 
secretion, freriucntly rednces the appetite, and increases the 
movements of the l)Owels. As a rule, it is better to smoke 
after meals than before, the irritating effect of tobacco being 
thus lessened. In acute gastric distnrbances tobacco should be 
int<'rdictcd entirely, and in chronic forms the smoking should 
be limited to a very few cigars a day. 

To})acco acts as an excitant to the nervous system, and should 
be pr(»hibite<l in all nervous diseases. 

ABSORPTION. 

In order properly to understand digestion and assimilation it 
is necessary to know something of absorption. This occurs in 
two ways : either l)y the material absorbed entering directly 
into tlie blood and passing thence to the liver, or by its entering 
tlie lacte^ds and })assing thence through the thoracic duct to 
enter tli<' l)l<»od-current of the left jugular and subclavian veins. 

Ab.-oi'j>tioii was formerly believed to take place to a verv 
mai'kcd extent in the stomach. This view is now held to be 
err<ine(»u-, probably little or no absorption taking ])lace in this 
organ. Water, as well as most other li(|uids, may be ab- 
sorbed -lightly from the stomach. Alcohol may be absorbed 
in it, and solutions of various salts may be absorbed slowly. 
Condiment-, by stimulating tlu! mucous membrane of the 
stoniacli, and iticfca^ing the secretion of gastric juice, aid in 
stomach ai)-of|.tioti. l^its are not absorl)ed bv the stomach. 
I*n)teiii.- and -iii^ar-, if taken in sulliclentlv concentrated solu- 
tion-, may be absorbed, the con^c-tion brought about by the use 
(.f alcohol or c..ii(Iiiiiciit- aiding the a])sor])tion. On the whole, 
Imwcvcr, al.M.i-ption iVoin the -tomacli is of trifling importance. 

Absorption in the Intestine. — Absorption takes ])lace 
j.rincipallv in the Mnall intestine. JMx.d passes from the small 
inte-tiiie in from five to twenty liours. On entering the large 



DIGESTION AND A nSOIlPTloN. n.", 

intestine the food Is still in a very fluid conditldn, nntwiih- 
standing the laru^e amount oi' absorption of \vat<'r and -;tll~ that 
takes place durino- its ])assa<^(' through the small iutesiinc. 

The absorption of water is a special function of the intes- 
tinal epithelium, and not a simj)le <|uesli<»n of ostn(»si-. Sohi- 
tions that closely resemble the blood as regards alkalinity m;i\- 
rapidly be absorbed. The water absorbed is taken up direct Iv 
by the ca})illaries, without lirst passiuLi' thi'(»uiili the lacteal-, 
although if very lar<re (piantities are taken, tlii- la>t mav occur. 
Our knowledge of intestinal absorption is due largelv to the 
ex])eriments of Heidenhain. 

This absorption of water is largely replaced by the abundant 
secretion of the small intestine. 

The protein food-material is absorbed chiefly as pej)tone or 
proteose, but it is very probable that syntonin, and even jtro- 
teins, like egg-albumin, may be absorbed directly. Peptoins 
and the like are dialyzable, and may pass through dead animal 
membranes, but the rate of absorj)tion is greater than ean be 
explained in this way. Dialyzable ])roteins, like egg-albumin, 
may be absorbed directly, so that absorption as it takes place 
in the intestine is a specialized function of the intestinal epi- 
thelium, and not a simple problem in physics. 

The proteins absorbed as peptones or proteoses pass directly 
into the capillaries, or, at least, they do so under certain ex})eri- 
mental conditions. Their presence can not, however, be demon- 
strated in the blood, and if solutions of them are injected 
experimentally, they produce poisonous effects. From this it 
may be seen that a change nuist be effected in these substances 
during their passage through the intestinal epithelium. It is 
the belief of some that the peptones and ])roteoses are changed 
into serum-albumins, but there is no definite proof of this. 
The ])rocess would be the reverse of the digestive proce-ses — 
the abstraction of water and polymerization. 

The carbohydrates are absorbed as dextrose or as levnlose. 
Dextrose can be demonstrated in the blood, and if solutions of 
this substance are injected directly into the circulation, it may 
be utilized by the tissues. The absorption of dextrosi' from 
the intestine is probably more than a simple process of ditVii-I<>u 
through an animal membrane, and it is possible that a special 
activity of the intestine is here brought into play. 

The fats are absorbed either directly as such or in the f "rm 
of fatty acids and soaps. The absor})tion of the small droplets 
of fat directly is thought to be a purely mechanical pi-oce--. 
The fatty acids are changed into neutral fats, a ]>i*ocess that prob- 



36 



CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION, 



ably takes place in the epithelial cells of the intestine. The fats 
pass for the most part directly into the lacteals and into the 
blood by way of the thoracic duct. 

Absorption takes })lace in the large intestine, but it is chiefly 
an absorj)tion of water. The feces enter in a very liquid con- 
dition, and, after making slow progress for almost twelve hours, 
thev reach the rectum in an almost solid condition. The large 
intestine })ossosses remarkable ]iowers of absorption, since egg- 
albumin, milk, and tlie like, given in the form of nutrient ene- 
mata oi- experimentally, may be absorbed into the system. 

I n determining the degree of absorbability of food, the amount 
of the elementary f )od ])rinciples ingested must first be ascer- 
tained, and the ])ro[)ortion that has not been absorbed deter- 
mined Irom the feces. The degree of absorbability of a food 
indicate-, in a measun', its nutritive value. According to 
Atwater,' IVom an ordinary mixed meal an average of 92 per 
cent, of protein, Oo per cent, of fats, and 1)7 ])er cent, of carbo- 
hydrates i.> absoi'bed in the body. '^ The proportion of the 
se\'eral nutrients which the body retains for its use are com- 
monly called ))ercentages or coefficients of digestibility." The 
following table, taken from Atwater, gives these coefficients of

The Absorption of Protein. — It has been estimated that 
about 80 per cent, of the protein is absorbed in the small into- 
tine and 14 per cent, in the large intestine. The proteins of 
animal food are much more completely absorbed than those in 



vegetable foods. Meat, for 



example, 



is very completely 



ab- 



sorbed, about 97 per cent., and there is very little residue left 
in the bowel. The same is true of fish and eggs, which are 
absorbed up to about 95 per cent. 

Milk is absorbed better in children than in adults, there l)eing 
about 4 per cent, residue in the former to 10 })er cent, in tlie 
latter. When milk is mixed with otlier foods it is much more 
completely absorbed, in fact, almost entirely. 

The reason why vegetable proteins are not c<Mtipletely ab- 
sorbed is not clear, but the flict remains that the percentage ol' 
residue is very high. In ])()tat()es 32 ])er cent, being left, while 
in carrots, beans, and lentils about 40 per cent, is k'ft. 

Absorption of Pats. — These are very completely absorbed 
if not given in excessive quantities. Fat contained in vegetable 
foods seems to be entirely absorbed. The lower the melting- 
point the greater the amount of absorption. Hutchinson has 
}4aced the limit of the capabilities of absorjition of tat of the 
ordinary individual at 150 grams a day, but there are \vi(]<' in- 
dividual peculiarities. Some persons cannot utilize mueli iat, 
and it causes diarrhea or other intestinal disturbances il' gixcn 
in excessive quantities. The excess is passed in the feee-. The

Esquimaux can utilize large quantities of fat, while in the tropics 
but little is taken. 

Absorption of Carbohydrates. — Carbohydrates are ab- 
sorbed more comi)letely than either fats or protein. Sugar is 
completely absorbed, and starch too unless given in certain 
forms. Under ordinary circumstances they leave little or no 
residue in the intestine. 

The Absorption of Vegetable Foods. — These leave 
more or less residue, according to tlie amount of cellulose and 
fiber they contain. Some cereals, as rice, are nearly completely 
absorl)ed, only about 19 per cent, of the protein being left. 
Oatmeal, on the other hand, leaves considerable residue. The 
legumes as ordinarily given leave a considerable residue, but if 
given in finely divided forms, as in legume flours, they are fairly 
well al)sorbed. Koots and tubers leave a considerable residue, 
according to the amount of cellulose contained. Potatoes are 
al)sorbed very completely. 

Green vegetables and fruits leave considerable residue. Some 
green vegetables, as cabbage, contain but little nutriment. 

Absorption in Mixed Diet. — This is better than when 
the various kinds of foods are given alone. Atwater has shown 
that the following proportions of the alimentary principles are 
al)sorb('d when the individual takes a mixed diet :

Practical Value of Absorbability in Diets. — On an or- 
dinary mixed diet tliere is sufficient residue to form normal feces. 
Wlien there is diarrhea or intestinal disturbances the foods 
chosen should l)e those which are as completely absorbed as 
possible. On the other hand, when there is constipation, foods 
having a considerable residue are valuable, so that fruits and 
green vegetables and the roots and tubers containing a consid- 
erable amount of cellulose and fiber should be cho.sen. 

THE INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS FACTORS UPON 
THE DIGESTION. 

The digestibility of a food is important. No matter what its 
value in calories or its ])rotein or other content, if the individual 
who eats it cannot digest the meal, it is of little value. In deal- 
ing with the .-ick this is of especial importance. In arranging 
a diet this nuist alwavs be taken into consideration. 



INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS FACTORS UPON DKIKSTION. 'M) 

Apart from the rielectlon of a proper diet, iinj)ortaiit factors 
that especially affect the digestion are the following:: 1. The 
hours, order, and frequency of meals. 2. Variety in diet. 
3. The appetite. 4. The tem])erature of icMxl. o. Rest and 
exercise before and after meals. 6. Emotion. 

1. Order and Frequency of Meals. — Tt i< usually 
customary to fix certiiin hours for the takinii; of meals ; theH<; 
hours vary with the occupation of the individual. In large 
cities, where the noon hour is taken up largely with active 
business pursuits, evening is selected as the most convenient 
hour for dinner. Sir Henry Thompson states that three gen- 
eral systems are in use, according to which, two, three, or four 
meals are taken daily. The first system, which consists of two 
meals a day, is followed in France and other countries on tlie 
continent of Europe. A substantial meal, consisting of fish or 
meat and other courses of solid foods, is eaten about noon ; 
no food is taken before the noon meal, except on arising, 
when a cup of coffee or chocolate and a small quantity oi' 
bread and butter are taken. The second meal, which is dinner, 
is eaten between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening. This meal 
is the largest meal of the day, and consists of soup, fish, meat, 
vegetables, salads, dessert, and black coffee. The second 
system, commonly in vogue in England, consists of four me^d- 
daily. The first meal, or breakfast, is taken at about 8 A. m., 
and consists of cocoa, tea, or coffee, bread, butter, bacon, fish, 
or eggs ; dinner is eaten between 1 and 2, and consists of 
soup, meat, fish, vegetables, and pudding; tea is taken at 
5 P. M., and supper is served at 8, and consists of meat, iisli, 
vegetables, and stewed fruits. Dinner is taken in the evening 
by the well-to-do classes, and a substantial limch is usually taken 
at noon. The third system, practised in tlie United States, 
consists in taking three meals daily. In many towns it is cus- 
tomary to dine at noon ; in others, in the evening. The usual 
breakfast, taken between 7 and 8 A. M., consists of fruit-, 
breakfast food or cereals, eggs, bacon, or salt fish, tea, cocoa or 
coffee, and bread and butter. Luncheon, eaten between 12. 30 
and 2 o'clock, consists of cold meat or a chop, vegetables, 
salads, and dessert. Dinner, eaten b(>tween 6.30 and S r. m.. 
is the heaviest meal of the day, and consists of soup, fish, 
meats, vegetables, salads, and fruit. 

The conventional order of taking food at dinner appears to 
be most rational, namely, soup, fish, entree, meat, vegetable-, 
salads, fruits. Small quantities of soup stinmlate the gastric 



40 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

secretion, do not interfere with digestion, and pass rapidly 
from the stomach ; the fish and entree are then partaken of, 
before the acidity of the gastric secretion has reached its 
height ; next follows the meat, the stomach now secreting 
liberal quantities of gastric juice wherewith to carry on the 
digestive processes ; finally come the carbohydrates, which do 
not undergo digestion in the stomach, and which enter this 
organ when the food already taken is about to pass from the 
stomach into the intestine. The eating of bountiful dinners, 
made uj) of many courses, when frequently indulged in, is 
likely to lead to digestive disturbances. Children and invalids 
should always eat dinner at midday, between 12 and 2 o^clock, 
and should never be allowed to take this meal at night. 

Tlie frequency of meals must be regulated according to indi- 
vidual conditions. Patients suffering from digestive disturb- 
ances and those who take very small quantities of food at a 
time require nourishment at frequent and regular intervals; 
whereas those whose digestion is feeble, should allow six or 
seven hours to elapse between meals ; ordinarily the interval 
between m«ils should be about four or five hours, this being 
about the time necessary for complete digestion of a mixed 
meal in the stomach. The habit of habitually omitting the 
noon luncheon, so commonly p;:'actised by busy Americans, 
should be discouraged. 

2. Variety in Diet. — In order thoroughly to satisfy the 
needs of the body the diet must be varied. Although a diet 
restricted to })ut a few articles of food may contain a sufficient 
(juantlty (»(" the alimentary ])rinciples to sustain the body nutri- 
tion, yet the monotony of such a diet becomes so objection- 
able that it can not l)e digested thoroughly. According to 
Woods .'uid Merrill,^ "it is a matter of common observation 
that diL^estion experiments made with one kind of food-mate- 
lial do n(»t give on the whole as reliable results as those in 
which two or more food-materials are used. In other words, 
it appears that with a mixed diet the same ])erson will digest a 
larger ])ro|»ortion of nutrients than with a diet composed of a 
single l'n(»(l-ni:d('ria]." Certain races restrict the variety of 
food l'r(»ni r< ligi'tus motives, such as the Jewish restriction of 
ham, poik, and oysters. (See Levitcns, eha})ter xi.) 

:'.. Appetite. — A])i)etite is the desire for food, and is 
dcjx-ndcnt upon vai'ious coiidiiions. It is controlled 1)V the 
<cn-ation (»!' huiieei-, and i- often induced by the sight, smell, 

' Tnittd Milt*- l)c|i;irt!iuiii i.f A,LTiciiliiiiv r>ullcliii No. SO. 



INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS FACTORS UPON DIGESTION. -W 

and taste of food. As Pawlow lias sliown,' the siiicll oi- si^lit 
of food will excite the flow of the gastric secretion, and this in 
turn will produce an appetite. Simple bitters or sonic iorm 
of alcoholic drink will at tinu>s induce this sensation. Tlie 
appearance of badly ])repared or inipropei-lv served Ibod will 
often dispel the a})petite. in children the appetite is usually 
good, whereas in the aged it is lessened. Some persons have 
voracious appetites, and abnormal cravinu:; Ibr ibod. This is 
often the case in diabetic and other conditions, when, at times, 
the appetite can not be satisfied. 

4. Temperature of Food. — The temperature of ibod 
when taken is of considerable importcUice. The ideal tem- 
perature is that of the body, from 98° to 100° F. (Fll'el- 
mann), the limits of safety being between 45° and l.'>()^ F. 
According to Hutchison, extremes of temperature of ibod are 
apt to give rise to gastric disturbances, such as gastric catarrh. 
UiFelmann states that a drink at a temperature of 12*2" F. 
increases the body-temperature 0.1 to 0.3 degree C. It is 
believed by many that ulcer of the stomach, so common in 
cooks, is often due to the taking of too hot foods. Hutcliison 
considers that the proper temperature of water intended to 
quench the thirst should be between 50° and 70° F. 

5. Rest and Exercise before and after Meals. — 
It is often advisable to rest, but not to sleep, after meals. The 
larger part of the work of the stomach should be completed 
before retiring at night, otherwise the sleep is apt to be dis- 
turbed. About one or two hours should be allowed to elapse 
between a light evening meal and be<:ltime, and three or four 
hours between a heavy meal and sleep. From personal obser- 
vations (see the section on Rest and Sleep in Gastric Disturb- 
ances) the authors have concluded that digestion is im]>rovcd 
by rest after meals, but impaired by sleep. In many instances 
a period of rest before eating meals is a valuable aid to diges- 
tion. Violent exercise immediately after meals inhiluts diges- 
tion, whereas moderate exercise one or two hours after meals 
materially aids this process. 

6. Food and il^niotion. — Severe mentnl strain and sti'on^- 
emotion disturl) the digestion, and for this reason food should 
not be taken until a ])eriod of rest and composure has inter- 
vened. On the other hand, ])leasurable sensations aid the 
digestion, and i^leasant conversation at the table is therefore 
to be recommended.

METABOLISM. 

Food is required for two purposes : to build up the body and 
repair tissue-waste, and to supply energy and heat. 

For purposes of study food may be classified into proteins, 
fat, carbohydrates, mineral salts^ and water. These are more 
or less complex combinations of the various elements, oxygen, 
nitrogen, hydrogen, etc. During digestion, assimilation, respira- 
tion, and excreticjn the food taken undergoes many changes, 
breaking down into sim])ler compounds or being transformed 
into others. These changes are termed metabolism. While not 
a food, the oxygen of the air plays an important part in nutri- 
tion. 

In youth, until the body attains its full size, material is 
need(;d from which to build the tissues. This material is de- 
rived from the f )od. From birth until death the life-processes 
cause a constant waste of the tissues, and this waste must be 
replaced or the body will become unable properly to carry on 
its functions. Only protein substances, that is to say, food 
containing nitrogen, can be used for this purpose. Fat may be 
used to store material in the connective tissue for future use 
as fuel, and also to protect the body from cold. 

Every act consumes energy. If a man lifts a pound a foot 
high, he must reproduce in his body that amount of energy. 
This energy is obtained from the food. The force that holds 
the f)od elements together in coml)iuation is called potential 
cuvTisy. Jj\ breaking u[) the food into simpler compounds the 
body .-ets this energy fre(.' or changes it into kinetic energy. 
The changes by which this is brouglit al)Out are not very well 
understoo<l at present, but they may be likened to combustion ; 
thus we speak of ^M)urning" up the food-material in the body, 
as if the body were a very superior kind of furnace, for the 
changes that go on are, for the most ])art, very })robably a sort 
of comj)l<'X oxidation. Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates may 
all be i)urnt up to furnish heat and <'nergy ; the last two — fats 
and carbohydrates — are used exclusively I'or one or the other 
purj)ose, il' we regard the fit stoi'cd in the Ixxly merely as fuel 
for future use. 

T\ui salts aid in the; digestiv<' and other j)rocesses, and are 
utiliz<'d in the composition of the bones and teeth. Water 
is ])rol)al)ly not used to fMrni>h eixTgy, but it sei'ves as a men- 
struum, if" the term be allowable, for the j)roce-ses.

After the body has reached its full development, the body- 
weio;ht remains more or less constant, and the food that ha- 
been used is excreted by means of the respiration and the 
urine, and, to a large extent, by the feces. 

The well-known law concerning tlie conservation of energy 
apparently applies to metabolism in animal bodies, and this has 
been practically proved, although the ex])eriments have never 
quite reached the ideal owing to the almost insurmountable 
difftculties that attend such experiments. In other words, Ibod 
that is used in the body furnishes the same amount of energy 
that it would furnish if burnt in a furnace or a calorimeter, 
providing the end-products in each case are the same. The 
heat- values of foods may therefore be taken as a standard ot" 
their food-value, but it must always be remembered that in the 
practical application of this fact in working out dietaries the 
digestibility and adaptability of a food are of great impiMlanee, 
as well as the amount of energy it contains. 

The heat-value of various foods may be determined expin-i- 
mentally by the use of an instrument known as a bomb calor- 
imeter, the result being expressed in ca/oric-t. A calorie is the 
amount of heat that is necessary to raise the temperatin-e of 1 
kilogram of water 1 degree C. (It is nearly the same as the 



44 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

amount required to raise 1 pound of water 4 degrees F.) This, 
expressed in mechanical force, means that a calorie would raise 
a ton about 1.54 feet, or that it is equal to 1.54 foot-tons. 

According to Atwater, the fuel-value of the various classes 
of food as ordinarily supplied is as follows : 

1 irram nf protein furnishes 4 calories ; 1 pound furnishes 1820 calories. 

1 " " fat '* «.9 '' ; 1. " " ^^-10 '' 

1 " carhohydnite furnishes 4 calories ; 1 pound furnishes 1820 calories. 

These figures are somewhat lower than the figures given by 
older estimations, and are based upon the most recent experi- 
ments. The fuel-values formerly given were : protein and car- 
])oliydrates, 4.1 calories per gram; fat, 9.3 calories per gram. 
It will be ol)served that fat has a very high food-value, which 
doubtless explains why it is stored as a reserve fuel. 

Experiments in metabolism have been made to determine 
manv things, l)ut the relation of energy and food to mental 
labor is a ])r()])lem that has never been worked out. The 
sco])e and importance of such experiments have been stated by 
Atwater, the leading American authority on this science, as 
follows : 

'' The science of nutrition must be studied from the stand- 
points f)f the metabolism of matter and energy if its funda- 
mental laws are to be thoroughly learned. The ideal experiment 
for the determination of metabolic balance would include a 
respiration experiment, a dietary study, and a digestion experi- 
ment in which the thermal values of food and excreta are 
detcrniincd. It would also include a measurement, with a 
ciiloriruetcr, or by other suitable means, of the heat produced 
in the orgaiii-in. Jf wo]-k is also performed, it must also be 
mca.-mvd. No cxpcriiiicnt has yet been made wliich reaches 
this i(l(;tl. .Moi'c oitcn sjx'cial ])roblems connected with metab- 
olism have been the subject of investigation, such as the fol-

pations, and conditions, and for animals of diHrrcnt kiiid> or 
animals fed for different economic ])nr])oses." 

In metal)olism-ex])eriments tlie resnlts are usually ex])r(sse(l 
in terms of the in-come and the out-<:(). The terms used 
desio^natc the amounts of nitrogen and oi' nitroiicn and curhon. 
These are the most readily ascertained and are of the oreale.-t 
importance. The thermal value of the iood and excreta nnist 
be ascertained, as well as the amount of enel■^'v used durin«r 
the experiment. 

The theories concerning metabolism lield by the anei( iits and 
by the older writers are both curious and interesting', dohn 
Mayow, who in 1(^68 advanced the belief that ibod is to the 
body what fuel is to fire, came near the vicM- as held t()-da>-. 
This was for a time forgotten, but lias since been revived b\' 
later investigators. Haller, in \li)'l, fornudated a median ieal 
theory, which was that both liquid and solid })art!eles were 
rubbed together until they became exhausted, and that the 
debris from this process was then excreted. Lavoisier, in 17S!>, 
stated that combustion occurs in the body in a way ana]og(»iis 
to combustion as we ordinarily know it. Liebig contributed 
much to this snbject, and many ojiinions which he advanced 
have since been proved to be correct. In 1S40 he jiubli.-lied 
a dietary study that was an attempt at a carbon balance. 
Pettenkofer invented the respiration-a[)paratus, and during 
18G5— 66 both he and Voit published the results of their classic 
experiments. 

The principal work along these lines is now being done in 
the United States. Especial mention nuist be made of At- 
water, who, with Langwortliy, collected data and published a 
resume of almost all the known metabolism-experiments of 
value in which the balance of in-come and out-go lias been de- 
termined. This was later published by the United States De- 
partment of Agriculture, as have been many of his ex])erin]eiits. 
With his coworkers he has conducted numerous investigations — 
too numerous to receive even mere mention here. Of especial 
interest are his experiments on alcohol, concerning which more 
will be said in another ])lace. The building of a respiratory 
calorimeter and the experiments made with it, the etfect of 
muscular labor on metabolism and on the digestibility of ibod, 
the related work on the chemic composition of .Vmerican ibods, 
etc., are among the interesting experiments conducted by this 
ardent worker. H. W. Wiley, of the Division of Chemistry 
of the Department of Agriculture, and his associates have con- 



46 CHEMISTRY ASD PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

tributed numerous valuable papers on the chemic composition 
of food and on the use of preservatives and adulterants. The 
results of metabolism-studies furnislied by Americans probably 
far exceed tliose of any other country. Much credit is due the 
Government for its efforts along these lines as well as to private 
individuals wlio liave ]a])ored in this field. Of these, mention 
nmst be made especially of Prof. Chittenden, of Yale Uni' 
versity. Tlie Russians have also done a large amount of valu- 
al)]e work, which, however, is unfortunately beyond the reach 
of most students. Among these Avorkers Tchudnovski, Pashu- 
tin, Danilevski, and Likhachev may be mentioned. In Ger- 
many the most prominent workers are Ranke, Pfliiger, Ziintz, 
and von Xoorden. The last named has accomplished a great 
amount (tf work having a direct bearing on the management of 
disease. In Ja])an, Kellner, ]\rori, and Oi ; in Italy, Malfetti, 
Albertoni and Novi ; in England, North and Paton, and in 
Sweden, Tigerstedt, may l)e mentioned. 

Methods of l^xperimenting in Determining: the 
Functions and Nutritive Value of Food. — The oldest 
apparatus of importance is the respiratory chamber devised by 
Pettcnkofer and Voit of Munich. Many different forms of 
this apparatus have been made and used by various observers. 
Among the most important of these are tlie so-called respira- 
tory calorimeters. Rubner and Rosenthal and Atwater and 
Rosa liave devised useful forms of these. The earlier ones 
Avere metal chambers large enough to permit a man or an ani- 
mal to live comfortably in them. Air was pumped through the 
ap})aratus, and measured and analyzed; food and excreta under- 
went similar investigations. 

As an example of the more recent and elaborate respiratory 
cahu'iincters or experiment chambers tlie one at the Wesleyan 
Unlvcr.-ity, made by Atwater and Rosa may briefly be de- 
scribed. It takes into consideration not only the air and the 
fo(.d and excreta, ])nt also the heat generated by the body ; and 
it is fniMiislied with a])})liances for nniscular work and for re- 
cording tlie same. The apparatus consists of a metallic cham- 
ber so (MA-ei-ed that the interior is unaffected by the outside 
ternperatnre. In this a man lives, eats, drinks, works, and 
sleeps. 'J1ie air that ventilates the (;hamber is warmed or 
cooled as necessary to hav(! it always of a certain temperatnre, 
and the amonnt of moistnre within it is regnlated. The cnr- 
rents of air ])as-ing into and out of the chamber are measured, 
and the am(»unt of carbon dioxid and water is ascertained by 



METABOLISM. 47 

analyzing samples of it. The i'ood and drink, tlu^ urine and 
tlie feceSj are weic;lied and analyzed, tlieir ])()tential ciici-Liv is 
determined, and the kinetie eneriry as ^iven ofV from the IxkK- 
in the form of lieat and external nuiscular woi'k' is also ascer- 
tained. The arrangements ior nieasui-ln<j; the heat jii-c vcr\' 
complete, and consist of devices ior prevent ini: L^ain of lo-< of 
heat through the walls or by ventilation. The hent uivcn oil" 
by the man in the chamber is carried oil' thron^h a scries of 
pipes by means of a current of water. The qnantilv of the water 
and the rise in temperature indi(;ate the amount (»f heat that 
has been given off. Tlie measurements of the temperature of 
the interior, of the inner walls, of tlie incoming and outg(»ing 
air, and of water are made for the most ])art by electric means 
which are so delicate that differences of a hundi-edth of a deirree 
are easily determined. The apparatus is provided with appli- 
ances for passing food and drink into the chamber and for re- 
moving the excreta. It is also supplied with a telephone. 

The accuracy of this apparatus was determined by ])as-ing 
an electric current through a resistance coil and by burning 
alcohol in the chamber. In the electric tests the amount of 
heat detected was found to be almost identical with the amount 
generated. In the alcohol tests the average amounts found by 
actual experiment were : for carbon, 99.9 per cent, of the 
amount generated ; for hydrogen, 100.6 per cent. ; and for 
heat, 99.9 per cent. The measurements of heat given off from 
the body of a man inside the chamber are so delicate that very 
slight bodily movements, such as rising from a chair or turning 
over in bed, are noted by the observer who is watching the gal- 
vanometer and thermometers. 

The experiments are usually conducted for a ])eriod of about 
eight days, tlie last four days and five nights being spent in the 
chamber. During the entire time the diet is uniform. The 
preliminary period of four days is occupied in bringing the 
body, at least approximately, into nitrogen and carbon e(|ui- 
librium with the food, and to make the determination of the 
nutrients absorbed as nearly accurate as practicable. The 
actual and the theoretic results obtained were very close, 9f» 
per cent, of the theoretic 100 jkt cent, being accounted lor. 
This, with a physiologic ex])eriment, is practically a demon- 
stration of the law of conservation of energy. 

It is impossible, in the present volume, to give anything 
like an adequate idea of the details of metabolism-ex])erinients, 
and for figures and results the student is referred to the reports 



48 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

of the investigators and to the excellent summary of Atwater 
and Langworthy already referred to. 

Respiration Experiments. — As foods are oxidized in 
the body, the metabolism may be determined by estimating the 
amount of oxygen used. The res})iration apparatus used in 
experiments of this kind consists of a mouth- and nose-piece 
connected with apparatus devised to measure the inspired and 
expired air. The amount of oxygen entering the lungs and the 
amount leaving can thus be determined, and the difference rep- 
resents that used in the body. This method has the advantage 
that tlie results may l)e obtained quickly and the apparatus 
is portabh\ Estimations are made from time to time, and 
the totals f )r the twenty-four-hour or other periods based on 
these. 

Ap[)roximately, 1000 c.c. oxygen will unite with either 1.05 
gram protein, 0..") gram fat, or 1.-34 gram sugar. The carbon 
dioxid given otf is also estimated, and this, divided by the 
oxygen consumed, gives the ^' respiratory quotient." This is 
used in cstiniating the total energy used. To do this the 
amount of f )od used must be known, and this is determined by 
estimating the f )od eaten and the composition of the urine and 
feces as regards the carbon and nitrogen contained. 



FOODS AND THEIR COMPOSITION, 

Xot only is it desirable to know about the digestibility of 
foods, but it is necessary to know about the composition of 
foods. The amount of protein or, what amounts to the same 
thing, the amount of nitrogen in any given food is the first 
point of interest. If the amount of nitrogen is known, the 
})rotein ('f)ntent is obtained by multiplying by G.2o. The pro- 
tein content is imj)ortant for many reasons, and is considered 
under the hea<ling of Th<' f^uantity of Protein Required. Some 
foods (•i>ntain nitrogen in the f)rm of chemical compounds, con- 
taining CX, or the so-called ])urin bodies. These are im- 
portant in certain diseases, as gout, and an^ tak<'n up under the 
heading of Purin Metabolism and (foiU. The amount of nitrog- 
enous tbod is a veiy great factor in all diets. The percentag<' 
of fat is likewise of importance, and in some diseases and 
under certain conditions it is desirable either to use large quan- 
tities of fat or to avoid fatty foods. The carbohydrate per- 
centage enters largely in the feeding of some patients, as in 
diabetes and the obese.

The Heat and Energy Value of Food. — As men- 
tioned above, it is convenient to think of foods as fuel, and that 
they each furnish a certain avaihible amount of heat or energy. 
So much in protein, so much in fat, so much in carbohydrate. 
Some foods are all })rotein, as the ^vhite of egg; some all fat, 
as butter ; and some all carbohydrate, as sugar. Most foods 
are, however, combinations of all these, and contain, in addition, 
certain salts and water. The water is not metabolized, and 
need not be considered in taking uj) the question of food values. 
The salts furnish so little energy that they too need not be 
counted out, but they are of very great value in metabolism, 
and as our knowledge of them increases their importance is 
more and more em])hasized. (See Salt Metabolism.) There 
are many problems in connection with the energy contained in 
foods, and they will be considered briefly. 

There are two series of estimates, one made chiefly by 
Rubner and generally used in dietetic computations. The 
other was made subsequently by Atwater, and his values are a 
little lower and perha})s more correct. Owing to the differences, 
discrepancies will be found in various tables and in different 
books, and these depend in ])art on the use of different standards 
in making the computations. At the present time the appli- 
cation of the food values to the diet as made by the general 
practitioner is only a]>])r()ximate at best, so that these discrep- 
ancies are not as im])ortant as would seem at first sight. The 
standards are as follows : 

Cnlories jier Grmn. 

Prfdein. Fat. Carbohydrate. 

Rubner 4.1 9.8 4.1 

At\v:itor 4.0 8.9 4.0 

Alcr)}i(il yields 7 calorit-s per jriain. 

To determine the fuel value of any food it is onlv necessary 
to multiply the j)ercentage contained in K)0 ])arts of the food 
by 4.1 for the ])rotein carbohydrate, and by 9.3 f »r the fat. 
For exam])le, \()() grams of milk contain 3.50 ]>er cent, pro- 
tein, 4 })er cent, fat, and 4.50 ])er cent, sugar. 

Caloric value of 100 grams of that milk would be 

Prr.tein rUA) X 4.1 - 14. .'?5 

Fat 4.0(1 X 9.3 ^ 87.20 

CarlH.hydrate . . 4.r)0 X 4.1 — 18.45 

Total valuo 70.00 

Numerous tables will be found throughout this ])ook and 
extensive ones at the end dealing with the percentage compo- 



METABOLISM. 51 

sition in common use. If the caloric value per })ouii(l is <:iv( n 
and it is desired to have it in grams, it may l)e remembcivd 
that 1 pound equals approximately 454 grams (453. OOj. 

It is desirable not only to know how many cahirics arc in ;i 
given quantity of food, but how mucli is furuislicd bv each con- 
stituent, so that the diet may be ])r(!seril)ed that contains a \\\'A\ 
or low protein content, a high or low fat content, or a liigh nr 
low carbohydrate content, as may suit the ))articular ca.-c on 
hand. The total food requirement must, however, always be 
borne in mind, and if one constituent is low, an increase corre- 
sponding to it must be made in one of the others. 

The fuel values of meats are usually stated too high, as much 
of the fat supposed to be included is trimmed off either by the 
butcher or the cook. The bulk of a food gives but little idea 
of its food value, as bulk often means a high water content. 
An ounce of fat, for example, is equal to about 2 pounds of 
cabbage. 

Nutritive Ratio. — In order to give some idea of the value 
in nitrogen or protein to the other constituents of the food, 
what is called the nutritive ratio is often stated in speaking of 
diet or foods. 

This may be expressed as 

Protein : Carboliydrate -r 2J Fat : : 1 : x 
Carbohydrate + 2\ Fat 
^^' ■" Protein 

In other words, it expresses the ratio between the amount of 
digestible protein and the amount of digestible carbohydrates 
plus the digestible fats. The fats are expressed in terms of 
carbohydrates, and 1 gram of fat is considered equal to '1\ 
grams of carbohydrate. For example, in Yoit's standard 
dietary there is 

Protein 118 grams. 

Fats 5C) •' 

Carbohydrates 500 " 

The digestible part may be obtained by using the coefficients 
of digestibility, and we find these amounts : 

Digestible protein 118X0.92^108.56 

Digestible fat 56 X 0.95 53.20 

Digestible carbohydrates 500 X 0.97 =^-^ 485 

The fat in terms of carbohydrates is 52.20 X 2.25 = 119.7. 

The total fat and carbohydrate in terms of carbohydrates is 485 -^ 119.7 = 601.7. 

The nutritive ratio is 108.56 : 604.7 or 1 : 5.5. 



52 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

Under ordinary conditions the ratio should not vary below 
5 nor above 7. Of late the tendency is to widen the ratio, 
that is, to increase the carbohydrate factor. 

Total Food Requirements. — The next question is how 
much food, i. e., how many calories, are needed by tiie body 
under ordinary conditions. This may be expressed in two 
ways : first, as so many calories per kilo or per pound of body- 
weight, or, as is frequently used for general discussions, the 
amount needed by a man of average weight, say 70 kilos or 
154 ])Ounds. The problem may be approached in two ways: 
One method much used is to study the food actually consumed 
by groups of individuals living under certain C(jnditions, and 
by making averages determine what is taken. Just because a 
great many j)e()ple take a certain amount of food is no reason 
that it re[)resents the optimum, as it is well known that the 
food eaten varies with the kind and amount available. On the 
other hand, it represents a practical guide, as we know that 
large groups of ])eople have lived on such an amount of food 
and maintained health and strength on it. 

Another method in vogue at ])resent in the scientific study 
of food requirements is to determine the amount of heat given 
otF by the body while in the calorimeter, as explained above. 

There are but very few calorimeters in existence, and the 
method is expensive, so that more frequently studies are made 
on the amount of oxygc^n consumed and the respiratory quo- 
tient. This may be done by a sim})ler form of res})iratory 
ap{)aratus. Another valuable method of study is to determirie 
the balance of the intake and output of nitrogen and carbon. 

The following figures are those of Rubner ibr an adult weigh- 
ing (>o kilos : 

Durin*,' rest in bed ISOO cnlori^'S or 2S calories por kilo. 

In repose 2100 '■ :V2 

Jn light work L'.'iOM " :]:\ " " 

In moderate work 2''.'iO " 4o " " 

In hard work .'Iloo " 4S " " 

These recpiirements vary owing to circumstances, and the 
needs during illness, as fever, are not those of good health. 
Some of the more im])ortant factors bearing on the total fi)od 
re(}uirement may conveniently be noted here. 

Occupation or the; (character of the work performed has a 
great deal to do \Nith the amount and character of food need<'d. 
The following table from Atwater should be studied in this 
connection :

These results may be used to ascertain in a general wav the 
food requirements of individuals when their mode ot" living is 
known, as in institutions. There will l)e a margin of error, hut 
the result wuU be of service in completing diets :

Total food requirement for the day 3780 " 

(Sherman.) 

The amount of tension under which the work is done will 
have something to do with the amount of food required. It' 
the work is done with a great deal of nervous energy, as in 
racing and contests of various kinds, the food requirements will 
be greater than if the work is done slowly and under less 
pressure. 

Even if no muscular work is done, there will be a certain 
amount of food required to maintain the body. Various esti- 
mates have been made as to where this energy goes. Perhaps 
the greatest demand is to maintain muscle-tone or muscle-ten- 
sion, and it is thought that from a third to a half of the energy 
required at rest is utilized by this function of the body. This 
is less during sleep than during w^aking hours. The circulation 
takes 5 to 10 per cent., and respiration from 10 to 20 jier 
cent., and about 8 to 12 per cent, are supposed to be expended 
in digestion and assimilation. No very definite suggestions 
have been made concerning the amount needed for the work of 
the secreting glands or the nervous system. 

Metabolism goes on whether resting or working, and also 
whether fasting or taking food. Metabolism is lessened by 
resting, still more by sleeping, and also by starvation, and each 
day that the fasting goes on there is a rather lessened metabo- 
lism. On the whole, however, the fasting metabolism is rather 
constant, and the energy is derived from the tissues of the body. 
First, the glycogen is stored in the muscles, and then the body- 
fat and other structures of the body. If food is not supplied 
after a certain length of time, death ensues. If food is given, 
the metabolism is raised, so that within certain limits the more 
food taken the more will be metabolized. 

Mental Work and Metabolism, — Curiously enough, 
mental work does not apparently utilize either heat or energy 
in the ordinary way. A man of a high degree of intellect in a 
respiration calorimeter does not cause any difference in the reg- 
istration by hard mental work, such as working out abstruse 



56 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

mathematic problems requiring hours of time. The same 
apparatus, however, is sufficiently sensitive to register the heat 
generated by turning over in bed or by raising the arm. 

Metabolism and Heat. — The body heat is maintained at 
or about 98.2° F., regardless of the external temperature. The 
heat is largely regulated by the exercise of the body, but in 
extremes the rate of food oxidation may be changed. In cold 
weather more food will be required than in warm. 

Metabolism and Fever. — In febrile conditions the food 
requirements of the body are raised, and an increased amount 
of food should })e given to cover this. (See Feeding in Fevers.) 

Climate. — In cold climates fat and protein foods are used 
more largely, while in hot climates carbohydrates are pre- 
ferred. Woodruff is of the opinion that climate affects the diet, 
mainly by the sup})ly it affords. 

Race. — The food of different races varies widely, but this 
is due, for the most part, to the varying conditions under which 
they live, and (\-pccially to the food-supply that is most avail- 
able by reason of cost and the ease with which it can be pro- 
cured. The Eskimos subsist largely upon raw or partly cooked 
meat and use large amounts of fat. In the torrid zone the 
natives eat largely of cereals, fruits, and vegetables. In the 
temperate zones the diet is mixed, and is dependent largely 
upon social and financial conditions, being of the most varied 
character in the case of the well-to-do, whereas among the poor 
it is apt to be made up of the cheaper meats, breads, and vege- 
tables. Soldiers and travellers from the temperate zones, going 
either nortli or south, usually require approximately the same 
varieties of fowl they had at home. Soldiers in the tropics 
crave and eat meat, when they can obtain it, in almost as 
large quantities as tliey would at home, and even after years 
of life in the tropics do not make any great change in their 
diet. 

Major Charles E. Woodruff, Surgeon U. S. A., expresses 
the following opinion: '^All natives of the tropics (where 
civilization causes over-population) are in a condition of 
nitrogen starvation and need much more nitrogen than they 
can p)ssibly get. The old standards of teaching that we 
should eat as the natives is most vicious. They do not ciit 
meat because they can not get it. They crave it, nee<l it, and 
eat it when they can. On account (»f the destructive effects of 
the concentrated tropical actinic rays on pr()to})lasm we need 
more nitrogen than at home. Please don't copy the old false- 



METABOLISM. 57 

hood that we need less. It is also true that we need fat, as it 
furnishes energy better than earl)ohy(h'ates. It is eaten in pref- 
erence to starches and sugars for this ])urj)()se by workers when 
they can afford it, but they take to starch (rice) because it is cheaper. 
It is incorrect to say that it overheats. It does not ()V(irh(!at us, 
and it is false to say that fat is not needed in the tropics." 

Sex. — As a rule, women eat and renjuire less food than ruen. 
This is largely due to the indoor and sedentary life led by .-o 
many women. Under equal conditions a woman of the same 
size requires the same amount of food as a man. On an 
average, women are only about four-fifths as large as men, and, 
consequently, dietaries for groups of women will require aljout 
four-fifths the amount of food. 

Si5je and Weig^ht. — For adults living under the .^anie 
conditions, the food requirements vary with the weight of tlie 
individual. The larger the body the more food will be recjiiired, 
but it should be noted that the requirement varies also threctly 
with the amount of surfaces exposed, so that a small man, having 
a relatively larger surface, will radiate more heat and will re- 
quire more food per kilo than a larger one. This has been 
tested experimentally both in man and in animals. As very 
obese individuals have a larger layer of fat which does not 
require as much energy to maintain as muscles, this also makes 
a difference in the food requirement. In computing dietaries 
these facts are rarely taken into consideration. 

Agfe. — For the reason given above, and also due to differ- 
ences in metabolism and owing to the influences of growth, the 
food requirements of the young is greater per kilo of body-weight 
than in adults. The food requirements during the first three 
months is 100 calories per kilo (45.4 per pound) ; during the 
second three months it is between 100 and 90 per kilo (40.9 
per pound) ; during the latter half of the first year it sinks to SO 
per kilo (36.4 per pound). Artificially fed children are thought 
to require slightly more than breast-fed children. In com])ut- 
ing dietaries the following figures from Atwater are generally 
accepted as standards :

Sherman has approximated the average amounts as follows : 

Boys of 14-17 2500-3000 calories. 

Girls of 14-17 2200-2600 " 

Children of 10-13 1800-2200 " 

Children of 6-9 1400-2000 " 

Children of 2-5 1200-1500 " 

Children of 1-2 900-1200 " 

Based on the amount per kilo : 

Under 1 year 100 calories per kilo- 

Under 1-2 years 100-90 " " 

Under 2-5 '' 90-80 

Under 6-9 " 80-70 

Under 10-13 years 70-60 

Under 14-17 " ... 60-45 

For the very young his estimate is somewhat larger than 
those made by Camerer, Heubner, and others. 

After middle age is passed the food requirement diminishes, 
and in old age it is considerably less, owing to the lessened 
exercise and the lower ratio of metabolism. Without muscular 
labor the re((uirenient per kilo has been estimated at sixty years 
of age at 34 calories per kilo, and at eighty years of age at 27 
calories per kilo. 

Protein Requirements. — Having considered the total 
amount of food required, the next question is to determine how 
much protein, fat, and carbohydrate shall be used to furnish the 
requisite number of calories. There is a great deal of diifer- 
ence of opinion on this subject. At the present time there is 
considerable known concerning the minimum amount of protein 
required, and tlie maximum that can be metabolized without 
producing deleterious results. The protein optimum or the 
amount on which the body does best is still an open question. 

There are several ways of taking up the .subject. Voit and 
many others have studied the food taken by various individuals, 
and he found that an average sized man at moderate work 
took about 118 grams of protein together with some oG grams 
of fat and 500 grams of carl)ohy(lnites. This represents some 
18.8 grams of nitrogen. This amount has come to be regarded 
as a standard. It is a lii)eral one, which need only be exceede<l 
in some forms of tu])erculosis and some other diseases, and 
which may be diminished in many diseased conditions to great 
advantage, as in gout and ne})hritis. Tlie protein needs of the 
body will be more clearly understood by considering nitrogen 
metabolism. 



METABOLISM. 59 

Nitrogen Bquilibrium.— It has been found in normal 
individuals that nitrogen equilibrium can be maintained <>n 
various amounts of protein food. This is determined l>y com- 
paring the total amount ingested witii the total amount excntcd, 
or by making the comparison of that al)sorl)cd with that \vhi(.'li 
is utilized and excreted in the urine. If the amounts corre- 
spond or nearly so the body is said to be in a state of nitrogen 
equilibrium. The total amount of food rc(piired is gov<'rned 
largely by the exercise taken. It does not seem to matter so 
much what form the food is taken in, so long as it can be util- 
ized. The protein metabolism, how^ever, does not <lepend so 
much on the amount of exercise as it does on the foocl taken. 
If small amounts of protein are given, equilibrium may be estab- 
lished at a low level, and if large amounts are given, at a high 
level. Thus, Chittenden w^as able to maintain health and 
strength on as little as 50 grams protein a day, and, on the 
other hand, nitrogen equilibrium has been established on as 
much as 150 grams a day and even 200 grams. The })ody is 
able to regulate the amount meta})()lized by the amount taken. 
If the body is not in a state of equilibrium it is either excret- 
ing more or less than is being ingested. In starvation, when 
none is supplied, it has been found that protein metabolism goes 
on about the same as w^hen food is given, only that the total 
energy must be derived from the body itself. It has been esti- 
mated that 13 per cent, is furnished by the body-protein and 
87 by the body-fat. A man at light work starving in a calori- 
meter was found to be using 1971 calories, or 31.28 per kilo 
of body-weight ; 71.7 grams of protein were oxidized, and 181.2 
grams of fat. In the first few days of fasting the nitrogen 
excretion is small, as there is a certain amount of glycogen 
which is stored in the body, and this is metabolized in place 
of the protein and so spares it. It has l)een found in lean 
animals later on in fasting that more protein is used in main- 
taining the body than in fat animals. In the fat animals the 
fat is used to a greater extent, and the fat may be regarded as 
sparing or protecting the protein. 

The effect of carbohydrate and fiits in ]>rotecting the body- 
protein holds good in feeding. If a diet is used which is low 
in protein, nitrogen equilibrium may be attained by adding 
either fats or carbohydrates to the diet, providing, of course, the 
protein intake does not fall below the minimum requirement. 
There may be a nitrogen loss when the total amount of food 
taken is below the requirement of the body, and this loss may 



60 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

be prevented by adding either carbohydrate or fat to bring it 
up to the standard. This is due to the fact that if the total of 
food supplied is too low, some of the body-protein is used to 
make up the deficiency. Gelatin may also be used as a sparer 
or protector of protein, 100 grams of gelatin being equivalent 
to about 35 grams of protein. It does not protect as well as 
either carbohydrate or fat. The nitrogen equilibrium is best 
maintained on a mixed diet, conhiining in addition to the pro- 
tein both fat and carbohydrate. If the carbohydrate is cut out 
of the diet there will be a nitrogen loss, owing to the fact that 
there must always be a certain amount of glucose in the blood, 
and if this cannot be supplied from the carbohydrate of the food 
it will be formed from the body-protein. 

It should be borne in mind that it takes some days to estab- 
lish a nitrogen equilibrium when the customary diet is changed. 
If the usual diet of an individual contains 16 grams of nitrogen, 
and the diet is sudden Iv chanwd, it will be several davs before 
equilibrium is established at the new level, whether it be above 
or below the amount usually metabolized. There will be slight 
losses of a transient character if somewhat less than usual is 
taken, but if the loss persists it means that eitlier too little pro- 
tein is l)eing taken in the food, or that the total caloric value of 
the food is below the amount required, or that the body is 
affected with some disease attended with a loss of nitrogen, i. e., 
some wasting disease. 

If the nitrogen balance is disturbed so that there is a plus 
balance, it means that nitrogen is being stored in the body. 
This occurs normally in young animals which are growing, in 
])regnancy, as tlie result of exercise that causes an increase in 
the size of the muscles, and in those who have liad some disease 
where they have lost flesh and are regaining their normal 
weight. 

I/OW Protein Standards. — Cliittenden and his followers 
believe that the best diet is that which contains l)ut little pro- 
tein above the minimum, together with fat and carbohydrates 
to cover the needed calories. TIhw urge that on this diet one 
may maintain health and weight, and that th(^ mental and phys- 
ical efficiency is greater than when more liberal diets are taken. 
They believe; that as the ])roteins are oxidized with the forma- 
tion of end-products more or less diffi(;ult of excretion, that any 
protein over the minimum requirement adds to the wear and 
tear of the bodv without increa^ina: its elliciencv. Chittenden's 



METABOLISM. Gl 

experinients included college professors an<l instructors, repre- 
senting mental workers ; United States soldiers, r('j)resentinL^ 
physical workers; college students, representing a combination 
of mental and physical workers. The experiments covered 
sufficiently long times, and it was found that nitrogen eipiilil)- 
riuni could be maintained on G to \) grams ot' nitrogen in>tt'ad 
of the IG or more usually taken by the average individual.-. 
Fats and carbohydrates were added to l)ring the food-value up 
to 2'")0() or 2G()0 calories {)er day. This total would seem to 
be too low for men doing more than rather light work, what- 
ever might be said of the protein content. 

Value of Low Protein Diet. — Chittenden's experiments are 
of enormous practical value in showing that a low j^rotein diet 
can be used over long periods of time without danger. J)iet.^ 
low in protein are of value in gout and gouty alfections, in 
some skin diseases accompanying disorders of metabolism, in 
treating the ill-effects of habitual overeating in arteriosclero.-is, 
in fevers and other affections. Brain-workers and those lead- 
ing sedentary lives will also doubtless do better on diets lower 
in protein than those usually taken. 

Objections to Low Protein Diet. — Many objections have 
been urged against this low standard of Chittenden. Perhaps 
the chief objection is that the human race has automatically 
arrived at the diets usually taken after centuries of eating, and 
that people in general apparently do not suffer from diets reason- 
ably high in protein. 

Some have believed that w^iile a low^ protein diet may 
be of great value over short periods of time, the ])rolonged 
use may render the body less resistent to infection or pos- 
sibly cause ultimate disturbances in metabolism. Those ac- 
customed by habit to low ])rotein diet may have difficulty in 
utilizing larger amounts should greater demands be made upon 
the body. 

In very hard work the fat and carbohydrate necessary may 
mean undesirable bulk and strain on the digestive organs, not 
to mention the less pleasing taste. 

Another much used argument is that all successful races are 
meat eaters, but as a meat diet is expensive it may mean that 
the successful being able to buy meat ])refers to eat it just as 
the rich consume expensive alcoholic drinks. It is not the 
wine that has made them rich. 

As a matter of fact the great majority of the human race 



62 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

will go on eating and drinking, according to their appetites and 
their means of gratifying them. Yet the problem is one which 
is of the highest human interest, especially in connection with 
the dieting in disease and in preventing it when danger has 
been anticipated. It is interesting to compare the navy diets 
made high in protein, because the sailor wants it and is happier 
and more contented and does better work than the crew on a 
perhaps more healthful, but less appetizing diet. 

The High Protein Diet. — High protein diets — those 
over 120 grams — may be of use in certain conditions during 
pregnancy and lactation, in convalescing from wasting diseases, 
and in beginning, certainly, of physical training when muscle 
growth is great, and in combating certain diseases, as tuber- 
culosis. During growth the protein requirements are higher 
than when adult life has been reached. 

High protein diets are ol)jcctionable in the sedentary and in 
all of those conditions indicated as doing best on low protein 
diet, and in general it may be stated that unless one has a defi- 
nite reason for doing so, the protein need not exceed the Voit 
standard. 

The Protein Optimum. — This is an open question. As 
just stated, the protein need ordinarily not go above 120 grams 
for the average individual, nor under 60 grams. This leaves a 
rather wide range, and it it safe to say that the optinuim lies 
between those two, jmd it will undoubtedly be found to vary 
with the individual and the conditions under which he lives. 
We do not believe that any standard will ever be fixed that 
will be of universal application, but we do think that in the 
future standards will be worked out to cover tlie various classes 
of normal conditions and the different disturbances of metabo- 
lism. Thus : In tuberculosis, oO per cent, above the normal 
of tlie given individual ; in ne})hritis, 60 or 70 grams daily ; 
in fevers, 70 grams, etc., are standards that are being put in 
practical use. Dietary standards have received general atten- 
tion for such a sliort time that much may be expected along 
this line even in the near future. 

Purin Metabolism (see also Gout). — Some years ago the 
proteins containing C-X^ began to attract attention. These 
substances are called the purin bases, and are a series of com- 
pounds called adcnin, guanin, hypoxanthin, xanthin, and uric 
acid. These substances occur in foods, such as liver, pancreas, 
and meats, in whicli they or their precursors are in the nuclear 



METABOLISM. {'/.] 

protein. They also are found in legunics and certain other 
foods. 

A man on a diet free from purin exerctes ().'■) or 0.1 irrams 
of uric acid daily. This is formed from the hreakin^ down of 
the nuclei, and is called the endotxenous purin. That which is 
in the body as a result of metabolism of i'ood is called exou;en- 
ous purin. This latter, of course, can be rei::ulated to a hirt^e 
extent by the proper selection of the diet. Those j)urin ba.-es 
are difficult of excretion, and in certain disease- there inav be 
purin retention if the amount is to(^ hi<:h (see (Jout). In cer- 
tain other diseases (as nephritis) it is a jrood thin^r to lessen 
the intake of purin bases. Normally, on an unrestricted diet, 
from 1 to 3 per cent, of the total nitrogen excreted is in the 
form of uric acid. 

Various tables will be found in the article on Gout, and 
the table on page 64, from Messan and Schmid, is one of 
the latest contributions on the subject.^ The foods to l)e es})e- 
cially noted on account of their purin content are printed in 
bold type. 

The Specific Dynamic Action of Protein. — This 
may be briefly mentioned here, and is one of the many 
curious and as yet unexplained features of metabolism. Kaeh 
form of food excites a specific action in metabolism — that is, 
there is a certain amount of heat or energy derived from each 
form which is lost and not used by the body. Thus, if })rotein 
carbohydrate or fat are fed separately to cover a given re(|uire- 
ment, about 30 or 40 per cent, more protein would be re(|uired, 
about 14 to 15 per cent, of fat, and about 6 or 7 })er cent, of 
carbohydrate. The protein raises the metabolism through some 
specific action. On a mixed diet this is not so important. 
This effect of the food-stuffs or the loss of energy may l)e calcu- 
lated by using factors determined by Rubner. For ])rotein 
30.9, fat 12.7, and carbohydrate 5.8. In a given diet the 
percentage of protein, fat, and carbohydrate should be multiplied 
by 0.309, 0.127, and 0.058 respectively to determine the 
energy percentage lost. Practically, in a mixed diet this 
amounts to a little over 10 per cent, above the food re(|uire- 
ments of starvation. Thus, a man fasting metabolized 2400 
calories, if a mixed diet containing 19.2 per cent, of })rotein is 
given, a total of 2745 calories would be recpiired to maintain 
the individual. If a smaller percentage of protein is given in

the food, a somewhat smaller total re((ulrem(>n1 will he needed. 
Kiibner advises a restriction of proteins in i'ever and in hoi 
weather and climates on account of thi^ specilie dynamic action 
of proteins. 

The Amount of Fat and Carbohydrate. — 'J Ik re is 
some little difference of oj)inion on this subject. While it 
would not be well under ordinary conditions to omit Irom tiie 
diet either all the carbohydrate or all the fat, as a matter of 
practical experience on a mixed diet, the exact amount of iat 
and carbohydrate does not make sc very much dilference a> lonir 
as the total number of calories needed to be suppli<'d in addi- 
tion to that supplied by the protein is covered. \'oit's standard 
was oQ grams of fat and 500 of carbohydrate. IMavlair, in 
England, reduced the fat to 51, and increased the carbohydrate 
to 531. Gautier, in France, suggests Ql) grams fat and \'M 
carbohydrate. Fat is expensive as a fxxl, and, from an eco- 
nomic standpoint, diets containing over 60 grams are not apt 
to be employed. In cold weather the amount ingested may be 
increased if desired, and persons doing very hard physical labor 
can take more. If fat does not agree, an amount of carbo- 
hydrate having an equal caloric value may be substituted for 
whatever fat is omitted. Fat-free diets are not advisable either 
in infants or young children. (See Rickets.) 

The amount of carbohydrate used will dejiend on the total 
number of calories needed, and can be determined by deducting 
the proteins and fats. A diet consisting largely of carbohydrate 
is objectionable chiefly on account of the bulk and the strain 
made in the digestive organs. 

Mineral Metabolism. — After the fundamental facts con- 
cerning the metabolism of protein of fat and carbohydrate had 
been ascertained, it was quite natural that the metabolism of 
the mineral elements in the food should come in for a large 
share of attention. It is now possible to determine the intake 
and output of iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium 
sodium, chlorin, and sulphur. The chief facts concerning 
mineral metabolism will be found under the heading of Salts. 

DIETARIES AND DIETARY STANDARDS. 

Before proceeding with the calculation of diets it will be 
well to study the following dietaries, as suggested by Hutchin- 
son, and all containing high protein (125 grams') •

68 CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DIGESTION. 

The Calculation of Rations. — Numerous suggestions, 
tables, and devices have been offered. In army and navy life 
and in ordering food for large numbers of people certain stand- 
ards are used, constructed more with the view of satisfying: the 
appetite than any theory of metabolism. Practically they work 
out about as above, and usually contain about 100 to 125 
grams protein, 50 to Qr^ grams fat, and the balance up to about 
3500 calories or more in carbohydrate. The tables of foods 
ordinarily used are arranged so at a glance the amount needed 
f )r any number of " rations'' or people may be told. In the 
army conversion tables these figures show the amount needed 
for one and any number up to 100,000. For the purveying of 
food such tables are of great help. Tables showing the com- 
parative cost of foods and their full value are of use in supply- 
ing a nutritious diet on as cheap a basis as possible. This eco- 
nomic side of diet is of the greatest importance, and one well 
worthy of the study of physicians and laymen. 

The Prescribing of Diets. — The physician usually deals 
with the individual and the individual diet, and there is a grow- 
ing demand for the scientific supervision of diet in health and 
in disease. Many physicians get hopelessly entangled, and 
fmally fdl back on set diet lists. To be able to understand 
the j)rescribing of food one must know certain facts and figures 
and be familiar with the values of simple foods in the amounts 
usually eaten. The number of calories furnished by the pro- 
tein, fats, and carbohydrates in any given food must also be 
known, so that diet may be varied to suit the individual need. 
Facility in this may be acquired easily by calculating from the 
tables given below the food actually eaten by the physician 
himself The weighing of the amounts served is the most ac- 
curate, but after a few times the amount may be judged by the 
eye. The totals will always be only approximate, but suffi- 
ciently accurate for the purposes of medical practice. The 
terms " a moderate helping," etc., mean little unless the portions 
have been checked up by actual weighing. 

The following facts must be learned, and should be copied on 
a card and carried about until they are memorized: 

1 ^nim protein = 4.1 or 4 calories] 

1 t^M-ani fat = 9.3 or 9 calories v approximately. 

1 gram carbohydrate ---= 4.1 or 4 calories) 

1 gram alcohol — : 7.

The protein requirement is approximately 1 to "J urams per 
kilo or J to 1 gram per ])ound of body weiulit, irivin^' an a\<'r- 
age of from 60 to 120 grams for a man of (J-l kilos or lol 
pounds. These are the mininuim and maximum under oi'di- 
nary conditions. In actual dieting, unless especial care is taken, 
the protein will increase with the increase in calorics on a ucn- 
eral mixed diet. If the individual is doing hard work and i< 
in good health, this does not apparently affect the general well 
being. 

To compute easily the number of calories in a diet, or to 
prescribe it, several methods have been suggested. Irving 
Fisher has compiled the table given below, showing the amounis 
of foods in common use necessary to equal 100 calories; by 
combining; the amounts the total number of calories can easilv 
be obtained. This is a simple method of prescribing diets, but 
less useful in determining the value of a given diet, unless it 
has been served in standard portions or fractions of such por- 
tions. This method is admira])ly suited where there is some 
one to superintend the serving, as in sanitariums, in hospitals 
where the food is served from a diet kitchen, and in private 
homes where there is a trained nurse. The patient or nurse 
writes down the name of the article and the amount of jirotein 
eaten, and by using the table the food value is easily ascer- 
tained, as follows : 

Protein. Fat. Carbohydrate. 

1 portion boiled fat beef 40 60 

1 " baked potato 11 1 88 

1 '' corn 13 10 77 

1 '' bread 13 6 81 

1 " apple 3 _l JH) 

Total calories, 500 90 84 336 

With this Fisher has arranged a graphic meth(Kl of repre- 
senting these values, full details of which will be found in the 
Journal of the American Medical Association, vol. xlvii.; 2s o. 
20, November 7, 1906.

Protein and Cereal Portions. — Arnold has suggested 
the use of standard portions based on arbitrary standards. The 
'^ protein portion ^' being equal to the protein in one egg^ 8 
grams ; the cereal portion being the amount of cereal that will 
contain 4 grams of protein. This method may be used to 
advantage where the protein content of the food is the chief 
concern. Tables showing the value of 100 grams of various 
foods will be found of use in this connection :

While diet-lists are easily prepared according to the method 
just outlined, it must always be remembered that the digesti- 
bility and absorbability of food play a most important role, and 
are not to be neglected in formulating the dietary ; for while a

certain food may contain a <>;reat many more calorics tlian an 
equal weight of another food, yet its relative indi<rcstil)ility 
and non-absorbability may render it far less availal)le as an 
article of diet. For example, while 4 ounc^es of sansap; pro- 
duce 510 calories, 4 ounces of cheese 520, and 4 ounces of 
beef only 280, yet the beef is far more diLrestiblc than either 
the sausage or cheese, and thus more valuable as an article of 
food. As has been aptly said, " We live not uj)()n \\liat we 
eat, but upon what we digest.'' Tlier(4bre, a diet-list nivinu^ 
quantities of food principles or calori(\s is useful (>nl\- as it 
suggests general principles that may be niodilied to meet indi- 
vidual conditions in health and in disease.

CLASSES OF FOODS. 
ANIMAL FOODS. 

xVxiMAL fo(xls contain much digestible matter, chiefly pro- 
tein.-, a considerable quantity of fat, in some foods carbo- 
jiydrates, and, in addition, water and mineral salts. Being 
thoroughly digested, they leave but little residue in the intestine. 
The various forms of animal foods — milk, eggs, meat, fish, and 
gelatin — will now be described under these headinirs. 

MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS. 

Milk, the most important of animal foods, contains all the 
elements necessary for the maintenance of life, and constitutes 
a complete food. 

Composition. — Milk contains varying proportions of each of 
the f >ur classes of food principles, protein, fats, carbohydrates, 
and mineral salts, and from 84 to 90 per cent, of water ; this 
latter varying with the quality of the milk. In a general way 
this is true of all milks, which are more or less alike, but which 
contain different percentages of the constituents. 

]\Iilk forms the exclusive diet for the young, growing mam- 
mals, l)ut owing to tlie fact that the proportions of proteins and 
fat are in excess of tlie carbohydrates, it is unsuited as an exclu- 
sive diet for adults. Unless otherwise stated cows' milk is 
meant by milk in this volume. Cows' milk is most extensively 
used for food, but the milk of goats and asses and some other 
animals is used to some extent. 

Fresh cows' milk has a sweetish taste, a characteristic odor, 
and is yellowish-white in color; on standing it separates into two 
distinct layers, the u})per being more yellow in color, of lighter 
specilic gravity, and containing more fat. For dietetic ])ui-p()ses 
it is well to think of cream as a milk containing varying pei-- 
centages of fat. The lower ])art, called ^'skini milk" after tlie 
removal of the cream, is of a bluish-white color, and may be 
considered relatively free from fat. The specific gravity of 
milk varies from 1.027 to I.O.'jo and it freezes at a slightly 
l(jwer temperature than water.

There are nuiiierous statements and theories coneeiMiinL:- t!ie 
reaction of cows' and linnian milk. Frc-liK' <h'a\vn, tlx' milk 
of most carnivora is acid to the litmns reaction; human milk 
is alkahne, sometimes acid or amphoteric;, and cows' milk ampho- 
teric — turning red litnms bine and \'icc vei'sa. ( )n expo-in-e to

Van Slyke and ]>abcoek. 

The principal nitrogenous compound of millc is casein, which 
differs fr(^m the other protein com])ounds in that it coiUaiii- bnih 
])hos})h()rus and sulphur. Casein is not coagulated by heat, but 
this change may be eifected by adding acid or rennet. The 
casein clot formed by adding acids may be dissolved by neutral- 
izing the acid, while that formed by rennet is not alfected by 
the addition of an alkali. 

Milk also contains other proteins, as lactalbumin, which i- 
similar to the serum-albumin of the blood, lactoglobulin, and 
lactomucin. The total proteins average about ?>/'] })er cent, of 
the bulk of the milk, or about '2r> ]>er cent, of the total solid-. 

The fats of milk consist of the glycerids of palmitic, >tearic. 
and oleic acids. In addition to these, milk contains se\-eral 
other fats in smaller proportions, to whicli the flavor of butter 
is in part due. The fat is suspended in the milk in the lorm 
of minute globules, which give the milk its white color and 
opacity. The fat globules in some milks are larger than in 
others. They are smallest from a herd of mixed common cow- 
and largest in the milk of Jerseys and (iuernseys. Fat a\'er- 
ages about 4 per cent, of the milk, or about -W })er cent, of the 
total solids. 

The chief carbohydrate of milk is lactose, or milk-.-ugar, 
which is not nearly so sweet as ordinary sugar, and is less solu- 
ble in water. It reacts to Fehling's solution like glucose, and 
in the presence of the lactic acid bacillus it is converted into 
lactic acid, which causes the milk to turn soiu-. J^actose Ibrm- 
about 38 per cent, of the total solids. 

Milk contains about 0.7 per cent, of salts, which exist chietly 
in the form of phosphates, chlorids, and sidphates. Potas-ium 
salts occur in larger quantities than do sodium salts. 

Calcium salts are very essential to young, growing animals.

AVhen the cow is diseased, various sul)stances not present in 
normal milk may be discovered, as urobilin and bile. Milk 
may also contain odoriferous substances from thintj^s which the 
cow has eaten, as wild garlic. Milk also absorbs odors from 
the air. 

Variations in Milk. — There are wide variations in the 
composition of the milk of difterent animals. While human 
milk contains more sugar and less protein than cows' milk, the 
fuel-value is about the same. Dogs' milk seems to be the 
richest, whereas that which comes from the horse is exceedingly 
poor, as may be seen from the following table :

Not only is there a wide variation in the milk of different 
animals, but cows' milk itself is subject to great changes in the 
percentage composition of its ingredients. These may be attrib-

pp. 267-362. 



84 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

iited to many causes, the breed and condition of animals and 
the food and the care they receive ])eing responsible in a great 
degree for these changes. As a rule, a young cow gives better 
milk than an old one, and a well-fed animal yields richer milk 
than one that is poorly fed. I'he milk-flow is greatest shortly 
after calving, but the milk increases in richness as the quantity 
Ijccomes smaller. 

Milk Ferments. — Milk contains numerous ferments, to 
wliich considerable attention has been devoted of late years. 
Marfan believes that these ferments probably make up for the 
deficiencies of the glandular secretions in the newborn, and 
that there may be specific ferments, which ex]:)lains the desira- 
bility of milk of a particular species as food for animals be- 
longing to it. The principal ferments are ])r()te()lytic ferments, 
reseml)ling trypsin, but less sensitive to acids ; fit-splitting fer- 
ments, lipase, amylase, jK^roxidase, and catalase. 

The Action of Heat. — The amount of change taking 
])lace in milk on heating depends upon the degree of heat and 
the length of expo^ui'c. Heating up to 60° C does not appre- 
cial)ly change the ap])earance or taste, although some changes 
whicli defy detection evidently occur. When the milk reaches 
a little over 60° C. a scum, composed largely of fatty matter 
and casein, forms on the surface. Acid milks are coagulated 
much more easily and more quickly than milk which is not 
acid, and even when pasteurized at a low tenq^erature such 
milks may clot. In order to ])revent this, milk should be pas- 
teurized as soon after milking as possible. Boiling milk 
changes its taste and color, the cream will not rise as quickly, 
if at all, and it is less easily coagulated by the action of rennet 
and less ea>ily ])ancreatized. The change in color is due to the 
])roduction of a certain amount of caramel from the milk- 
sugai- ; lecithin and nuclein are deconq:>osed, lessening the 
amount of or^raiiic ])hosphorus ])]'esent and increasing the inor- 
ganic phosj)horus ; the calcium and magnesium salts and part 
of the j)h(^-;phates are ])reci|)itated ; the carbon dioxid is driven 
off, some of the fit globules coalesce, and the serum-albumin is 
coagulated ; the fei'ments of the milk are also destroyed. 
Although these enzymes \vill withstand a tenq)erature of 60° (\ 
for an hour without much injury, most of them ai'e totally de- 
stroyed by a temperatui'(M)f ()0° ( '., and the mo>t resistant by 
a tenq)eratiire oi' 7(j° ( ". 

Froijen Milk. — I'reezing milk is sometimes I'esorted to as 
a means of keeping it dui-ing transportation. It should be

kept frozen until used. ^\'llile tins mctliod 1- cmploNcd in

Cold storage of milk is fre(]nently i-esortcd to, hnt when i!ic 
milk is kept at a temperatnre of ahout 0" (\ there i- \(r\- enn- 
siderable growth of baeteria, espeeially of certain vai-ieti<- ih.it

subject has been made by Pennington,' to N\hieli the render i- 
referred for details. In sueJi milk the bacteria inerea-e in mnn- 
ber for live or six weeks, and after that certain species die din, 
while the most resistant a})i)arently are pre.-ent e\-en I'oi' yeaiv-. 
The acidity is very much incivased, although cm-d rarely >ep;i- 
rates. The protein of the milk is digested, and in -ohh' ea-(^ 
as much as 50 per cent, is changed into soluble conipoimd. 

Sterilisation and Pasteurisation. — Heat i-(iiiploy((l 
very frequently in keeping milk, and there are two method- in 
vogue, spoken of as sterilization and ])asteuri/ation. 

Sterilization of milk is accomplished either by boiling, ])ret- 
erably in the vessel in which it is to be kept, or by placing the 
bottles in one of the numerous forms of sterilizers that are on 
the market. The essential ]^art of the ]n*ocess is that the milk 
be heated to '212° F. and maintained at that temjxniture ibr t<ii 
minutes or longer, or sufficient to kill all the living bacteria 
which the milk contains. It is to be noted, however, that th" 
spores of spore-bearing bacteria are not killed l)y this tempera- 
ture, and that if the milk is kept under suitable conditions for 
bacterial growth, bacteria will develop from the spores, and the 
milk may spoil in consequence. In order to secure perfectly 
sterile milk it is, therefore, necessary to repeat the sterilization 
three times on three successive days. In practical work this i- 
rarely done, except in the ])roduction of culture-media for bac- 
terial researches or in preparing milk for long voyage^. Ordi- 
narily, milk heated once and then ki'pt cold, 40° F. or under, will 
keep perfectly well the length of time rcMpiired in its ordinary 
consumption. There are certain objections to sterilized milk. 
Certain changes are produced in the milk which are detailed 
under the heading of the '^ Effects of I Feat." Sterilizing al-o 
kills olf the ferments and places the milk in the class of lifeless 
foods. Sterilizing on a large scale has never l)ecoine popular 
in America, ])erha])s on account of the change in taste and the 
added expense. It may be used ^\'itil advantage, howevei-. in 
keeping milk in very hot weather, especially when the icesup])ly 
is deficient. 

^Journal of Biolof/ical Chcuudnj, 1908, ]>, 35o. 



S6 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

By pasteurization is meant the process by which the milk 
is rendered more or less sterile ])y heating to 167° F., and in 
some instances to a lower temperature, maintaining this degree 
of heat for from twenty to forty-five minutes, and then cooling 
the milk rapidly to 40° or 45° F. or lower. This degree of tem- 
perature is sufficient to kill oif most of the bacteria and esj^e- 
cially the pathogenic bacteria, Ijut it does not render the milk 
absolutely sterile, so that it does not keep as well as that which 
has been heated to a higher temperature. It has the advantage, 
however, of not changing materially the composition of the 
milk. Pasteurized milk should be kept cold or it will spoil 
nearly as ra})idly as unheated milk. It is useful in summer 
and in kee2)ing milk which is to be fed to babies, and is being 
used at the present time very extensively for keeping commer- 
cial milk. In the household, for the ])urpose of infant feeding, 
pasteurization is done in two ways. Best, by using one of tlie 
special forms of pasteurizers, such as Freeman's, which con- 
sists of two ])arts, a pail for the water and receptacle for the 
bottles of milk. The pail is a simple pail with a cover; there 
is a groove extending around the pail to indicate the level to 
which it is to be filled with water, and supports inside for the 
receptacle for the bottles of milk to rest on. The recej^tacle 
for the bottles of milk consists of a series of hollow zinc cylin- 
inders fastened togetlier ; this fits into the pail, so that the 
lower inch of the cylinders is immersed in the water. This re- 
ceptacle has two sets of horizontal supports, the upper set con- 
tinuous around the receptacle, for use while the milk is being 
heated ; the lower interruj)ted set is used for raising the re- 
ceptacle during cooling. Such rece])tacles are made for ten 
O-ounce bottles, seven 8-ounce l^ottles, tlu'ce 1-pint and one 
|-])int bottles, and two 1-cpiart bottles. There is also a large 
apparatus for the use of hos})itals or ])u1)lic institutions, which 
has a rece])tacle for forty-three G-ounce or H-oiuice l)ottles. 

The apj)ai'atus is used in the following way : The ])ail is 
fille<l to the level of the groove with water, covered and put 
on the stove, the reeeptaele ibi- the bottles being left out. The 
bottles of milk are then filled, st(»ppered \\\t\\ cotton, and 
dropjx'd into their places in the (yliiidei-s. Siillicient water is 
poured into each cylinder to siu'i'ound the body of the bottle. 
As soon as the water in the pail boils thoroughly, it is taken 
from the stove and set on a mat or table or other c()n-c«»nductor 
in a ])lace where there is not a draft (»f wind blowing on it. 
The hd of the pail is renio\'ed and the receptacle rests on the 



ANIMAL FOODS. 87 

lower supports. The lid is then ra]>i<lly put on the ])ail, and 
the pail is thus allowed to stand for ihivc-cjuaricr- of an Imwv. 
During tlie first fii'teen minutes tlic tcnijicratiu'e ol' the milk 
rises to about its maxiinuni, or above ^Jo' C, the ])()iiit doiicd 
for pasteurizing, and remains there tlie remaining thinv min- 
utes. During tlie last lifteen nnnutes the (Mtvcr ol" the pail is 
removed, the reeeptaele is lifted and given a turn so as to rc-t 
on the lower suj)])orts, thus bringing the top of the cNliiidcr- 
containing the bottles above the level of the pail. The j»ail i- 
then put under a cold-water faucet and the water i- allowed lo 
run into the ]iail and overtloNv, l)ut it should not luii iiii(» the 
C}dinders. Thus the hot water is replaced by cold water, and 
in iifteen minutes the milk in the bottles is ot al)oul the tem- 
perature of the cold water used. The bottles may then be ])nt 
into a refrigerator until required for feeding. This i-apid cool- 
ing is a most necessary part of a low-temperature sterilization, 
the importance of which is a})t to be overlooked. 

When there is no special apjwratus at hand, reas(»nably good 
results may be obtained by placing the milk bottles in a j)ail, 
filling the pail to the height of the milk in the bottles and 
bringing nearly to a boil, then setting to one side for thirty 
minutes. In commercial pasteurization, s})ecial forms of appa- 
ratus are used, in which large quantities of milk nuiy be 
heated the required temperature for twenty minutes. 

The advantages of pasteurization are that it is a cheap and 
effective method of preventing the ordinary infectious diseases 
which may at times be spread by milk, and doubtless lessens 
the number of cases of infantile diarrhea. It should be re- 
membered that pasteurization cannot make bad milk good or 
dirty milk clean, and when used for infants or invalids it nuist 
be modified in the same manner as unheated milk. 

The disadvantages of pasteurized milk are, that it is u.-ually 
done a long w^ay from the place of production, the milk nuiy 
be spoiled before it is pasteurized, and while the bacteria are 
for the most part killed, the toxins which may have ])een formed 
are not destroyed, and so dangerous milk may be sold i'ov good 
milk. This is, however, counterbalanced by the real lesseninLj, 
of infantile diarrhea. Another disadvantage is that the milk 
producer is apt to become careless and trust to pasteurization to 
kill oft' the bacteria instead of using cold and cleanlines-. 
Pasteurized milk is popularly supjx^sed to be le>s digestible 
than unheated milk, especially for infants. The ditferene(^ in 
digestibility of pasteurized and unheated milk is certainly 



88 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

slight, but the be-t results in infant feeding are obtained by the 
use of unheated milk. We are of the deeided opinion that 
unheated milk is far superior in the long run, where it can be 
obtained of sufficient purity to permit of its use. There are 
other objections sometimes urged against heated milk, sucli as it 
favors the development of scurvy. This is evidently true, but 
is a lesser evil than diarrhea. 

Sterilizing milk under jiressure is rarely resorted to outside of 
laboratories. A temperature of 220° F. for thirty minutes is 
ordinarily considered to produce sterile milk, but sometimes 
even this is insufficient. 

The loss in viscosity in sterilized and pasteurized cream, 
rendering it thinner and difficult to whi]:), may be counteracted 
by a material called viscogen, suggested by Babcock and 
Russel. It consists of a mixture of half an ounce of cane- 
sugar in a quart of lime-water. It is allowed to settle and the 
clear fluid used in the proportion of about two-thirds tlie 
amount needed to neutralize the cream. This may be easily 
determined by titration. 

Digestion of Milk. — AVhen milk enters the stomach it 
is coagulated by the hydrochloric acid and the renuin of the 
gastric juice. These curds, or coagula, consist of precipitated 
casein and a proportion of the fat that has become entangled in 
the curd. They vary in size and consistence according to tlie 
amount and the dilution of the milk taken. The casein soon 
undergoes change, being converted into some form of peptone, 
and the fat is again lii)erated. Tlie albuminous envelope of the 
fat-globules is dissolved, and the fat coalesces, forming larger 
dro])s, in which condition it passes into the duodemmi. A 
portion of the water and some of the salts are absorbed in the 
stomach. The curd that has not been acted ujxni by the gastric 
juice, together witli tlie water, salts, and carbohydrates that still 
remain, also ])ass into the intestine, where their digestion is 
com])l('te(l. Boiling increases the digestibility of milk, the 
precipitate being dej)osited in a more flocculent form. If the 
milk is ])reviously diluted with lime-water, barley-water, or one 
of the aerat(;d waters, such as Vichy, the curds formed are 
smaller and softer, and the milk often rendered more palatable. 
Bread and crackers added to milk make a good mechanical 
diluent by mingling Avith it and maintaining a soft condition of 
the curds. The addition of alkalis m:iy ])e resorted to with a view 
to neutralizing the acids. This has the effect of coagulating the 
casein more slowly, and forming Hocculi rather than cheesy masses. 

The Color of Milk. — A^arious chamres in the color of 



ANIMAL FOODS. 89 

milk are not uncoinmoii, the best known of wliicli is Miic milk, 
and while it rarely occnrs in clean and w('ll-k(j)t dairic-, it i- 
not unfrequently seen in milk which is poorly handled and 
exposed to contaniinjition. The color is due to the action of 
bacteria, one described as the JJacillns cyanoiiciics b(•in^• pcrlmp- 
most freqnently present. The milk tinwis blue in spots and 
finally assnmes a difrnse sky-bliie coloi". lied milk m:iy bcdii'- 
to the presence of blood due to injin-ics oi" the nddcr or maii,- 
mary gland, to the cows having led on plants containing r(<l 
pigments, snch as tlie madder ])lant, and moi-e rai'cK' to th ■ 
action of bacteria, of which there are several that will pro(hicc 
a red color, the best known of which is the liacilliis {)rodigio-n-. 
Green, yellow, chocolate, and black milk have been described, 
wdiich are dne to varions forms of bacteria. 

Slimy or Ropy Milk. — This is a very cm-ions change 
which occasionally takes place in milk and is due to the action 
of bacteria, one described as the I>acillns lactis viscosi being 
perhaps the best kuowm. The change is seen al^o in certain 
diseases of the mammary gland. The milk becomes slimy or 
ropy, and can be drawn ont into long thin threads, even as loi-' 
as ten feet. In some conntries, ])articnlarly Norway, slimy 
milk is prodnced by the addition of certain leaves to the \\u\k 
and the prodnct is esteemed as a food. The leaves contain the 
slime-prodncing bacteria. This change is also induced for the 
mannfactnre of certain cheeses, particnlarly Edam. 

Bitter milk is very common, most freqnently being eansed 
by the cows having fed on plants containing bitter substance-, 
chiefly the lupines; it occnrs nlso diu-ing the last stages of 
lactation ; is sometimes caused by abnormal conditions of the 
udder, and may be produced by the presence of certain forms 
of bacteria. 

Alkaline Fermentation of Milk. — ]\rilk which has 
been boiled does not sour through spontaneous fermentation : 
but if exposed to the air at ordinary tem])eratnre it become^ 
alkaline in reaction, sometimes develo])s a bitter taste, and then 
curdles. Later on the curd dissolves and a more or less clear 
fluid is left which has no resemblance whatever to milk. There 
are a number of different bacteria which may produce thi< 
change. 

Flavors in Milk. — The flavcn- of milk may vary from 
time to time. This may be due to the food, such things a< 
wild onion, even in small quantities, affecting the flavor of the 
milk very markedly, and disorders in the cow may also cau>e 
unusual flavors for a fcnv davs. Milk also absorbs odors, and 



90 CLASSES OF FOODS 

if kept in an ice-box with odoriferous substances it may take on 
their flavors. The growth of bacteria also alters the taste of milk 
very materially, and may impart many different flavors to it. 

Bacteria in Milk. — Milk is a most excellent culture- 
media for bacteria, and most germs grcnv luxuriously in it at the 
expense of the quality of the milk. The changes produced are 
largely those of decomposition, and many of them are exceed- 
ingly complex, resulting in the production of changes in flavor, 
odor, color, and the quality of the milk. The proteins may 
become decomposed, the sugar converted into gases, alcohol, or 
acids, while the fats are but little changed. 

The number of bacteria in milk varies greatly, the very best 
milk containing but a few tliousand bacteria per cubic centi- 
meter, while very poor milk may contain many millions in the 
same quantity. In 1006 the milk sold in Washington, D. C, 
averaged 22,134,000 per cubic centimeter, and the year follow- 
ing there were 11,270,000. In Rochester, and many other 
cities, 100,000 is regarded as the limit in milk flt for human 
food. Milk which is ceitified by milk commissions ought not 
to contain more than 10,000 per cubic centimeter, although 
some commissions have adopted other numbers as the maximum 
limit. So-called inspected milk should not contain over 
100,000 per cubic centimeter, and milk containing more than 
this should be regarded as unfit for human consumption, and 
especially so for infants and young children. Milk containiug 
large quantities of bacteria must of necessity undergo consider- 
able decomposition, and clinical experience teaches us that such 
milk is unfit to feed infants and may produce gastro-intestinal 
disease. The nature of the l)acteria present is important, as 
disease-producing germs are dangerous to the public health. 
Milk which contaius but few bacteria will, as a rule, contain no 
disease-producing bacteria, or but very few, while milk with 
very high bacterial counts is extremely liable to contain them. 
Almost all of the pathogenic bacteria grow better at or near the 
body temperature, and grow slowly, if at all, in milk which is 
cold enough to prevent the rapid growth of bacteria. 

Each time milk is handled there is an increase in the number 
of bacteria, and they are also increased in se})arated and filtered 
milk. Under ordinary circumstances milk di-awn from the 
udder of the cow contains bacteria which, with reasonably 
simple ])recaution, may ])e easily ke])t under 5000 per cubic 
centimeter. To keep these from increasing, the milk nuist be 
])rotected from fnrther c(jntamination and nuist be kept cold. 
The increase may also be influenced l)y pasteurizing and steril-

or 40° F. will have little or no iiierease in the nuiiihcr oi" ordi- 
nary bacteria, and there is not nuieli arowtli until it i> warmed tn 
70° F. ; after that conditions are more i'avorablc to bacici-ial 
life, and between 80° F. and J)<S° F. the increase i- eiioiiiioii-. 
When the temperature reaches over lOO V. the bacteria 
ordinarily found in milk do not grow well, and when the milk 
is heated to 125° F. the eil'eet is to kill some ol'tlie germ-, and 
an ex|)osure of ten minutes at 1()0° F. will kill the majority 
of milk bacteria, but not the spores. 

The source of the bacteria is of interest, as the milk as 
formed in the mammary gland in the healthy cow is iree from 
germs. Small wounds of the udder may lead to bactei-ial 
invasion and the germs get into the mouths of the teats and so 
into the milk chamber, so that the first milk drawn should be 
rejected, and even the milk drawn Liter may contain some 
bacteria from the growth of them having extended up the milk 
ducts. The milk at the end of the milking is nearly or (piite 
sterile. Inflammation of the udder and mammary gland may 
lead to very serious infection of the milk by disease-|)roducing 
bacteria. During the milking the contamination is oiten sur- 
prisingly great. The number of bacteria in the air of the 
ordinary cow barn is very great, and if the hay h)ft is above it 
and the hay is thrown down just previous to milking the air 
may be clouded with germs. Particles of manure, hairs, and 
other foreign material may drop into the milk, and the milker's 
hands and dust from his clothing are also a frequent source of 
contamination. The bacteria from man are more dangerous to 
human health than those from the cow. If the milk pails and 
other receptacles are not sterilized, a goodly lot of bacteria \vill 
be found in the milk collected in the seams, and the cloth 
through which the milk is strained may add to the number if it 
is not sterile. The cooler, the cans, and the milk bottles, unless 
sterilized, all add their quota of bacteria, and evory time the milk 
is handled or opened to the air additional contamination takes 
place. The sum total of all these may be very great, and the 
milk may start on its journey with more bacteria in it than 
would be safe for infants or invalids. 

Various species of bacteria may be found in the milk ducts. 
and these differ in different cows, but certain species of strepto- 
cocci are most often present. These are reasonably constant, 
and, as a rule, do not apparently produce any marked changes 
in the milk, although at times they are evidently the cau.-e of 
changes to an alkaline reaction. The question of these strepto- 



92 CLASSES OF FOODS 

cocci and milk is deserving of further study, as they are not 
thoroughly understood, and as yet there is not a satisfactory 
method for distinguishing the non-pathogenic from the patho- 
genic. 

Leukocytes may be found in the milk of healthy cows, but, as 
a rule, they are more numerous in the milk from diseased ani- 
mals, and, if present in large numbers, a special examination 
should be made for garget and other diseases. Just what an 
average number would be cannot at this time be definitely 
stated, but the milk from the average herd kept under favor- 
able conditions will contain over 100,000 per cubic centimeter. 
In diseases of the udder and in garget the number reaches 
500,000 or over, and may extend into the millions. 

The Souring of Milk. — AVith but few exceptions milk 
will sour in various lengths of time, and it may be regarded as 
a normal phenomenon. As a matter of fact, milk which does 
not sour under ordinary conditions should be regarded with sus- 
picion and tested for preservatives. When the milk reaches a 
certain stage of acidity it curdles. Curdling may be due to cer- 
tain yeasts and moulds, and may be produced by rennet, but by 
far the most frequent cause is the lactic acid bacilli. Over a 
hundred different bacteria have been described as causing the 
souring of milk, but for the most part many of tliese are not 
commonly met with, and many of the others belong to one or 
two groups. By far the most common of these is w^hat is ordi- 
narily spoken of as the lactic acid bacillus, which does not ])ro- 
duce gas, and which grows best in deep vessels, where the air is 
more or less excluded. Under favorable conditions these bacilli 
multi])ly rapidly, and the acid which they ])roduce unites with 
the casein, and, wdien it reaches a certain percentage, it preeipi- 
fcites. Heat will hasten this, as is frequently demonstrated by 
the curdling which takes j^lace on heating or adding nearly 
turned milk to hot tea or coffee. Milk soured by the lactic acid 
bacillus has a firm clot with a little whey on top and is free 
from gas. When the curd is broken up by shaking, it separates 
from the whey and sinks to the bottom. Such milk has a 
pleasant acid taste and is nnich used for food, eitlier as clabber 
or curds and whey or cottage cheese. Another grouj) of acid- 
producing bacteria grow best in milk which is well aerated, as 
that in shaUow ])ans, and it produces gas, so that tlie curd is 
broken up and contains gas bubbles. These bacteria are a 
source of troul)le to manufacturers of cheese. The changes pro- 
duced in milk by the first group of lactic acid bacilli are of 
value in the niaiuilacture of butter and cheese, but are unfavor-

There is a popular beliel' that a thunder shower will -. an-

Milk Production. — The production of milk which will 
keep a reas(.)ual)le length of time and is i'wv iVoin object iona hie 
features is a comparatively simple matter, but it r( (juiic- caic 
and constant supervision, and is best undertaken by per-nn- 
trained in dairying. The lirst coir^ideration is the cow hei-db 
and, to produce good, ])ure milk, the cow nuist be healthy and 
must be ke])t clean. Sick cattle should ])e sej)ai'ated from the 
herd, and if a herd is to be kept free from tubereulosi>, no cow 
shoukl be added to it without first having l)een tested by tubci-- 
culin, and tlie entire herd should be tested from time to time. 
The cow should be groomed rc^gularly, tlie same as a horse, the 
oftener the better, and this reduces the bacterial contamination 
of milk very materially. Some dairymen cut oil* the loiigcf 
hairs about the flanks and tail to lessen the danger of having 
them soiled with feces. The grooming sh.ould be done befoi'e 
milking, and the cow should not be allowed to lie down until 
she has been milked. The stables should be clean, light, and 
airy, and a special milking room is desirable uidess the barn i- 
of good construction and of sufl^icient si/e. Anything which 
stirs up dust should be avoided. The barnyard shotild be 
kept clean and drained. The employees should be healthy and 
clean, and the hands should be thoroughly scrubbed before 
milking. jNIany large dairy larms supply sterile suits to their 
employees to be WT)rn at milking time. >so on(> who has, or 
who has recently had, or who is associated in any ^vay with any 
contagious disease, should be allowed to have anything whate\-ei- 
to do with milk production. 

The milk pails and all milk receptacles shotdd be kept clean 
and scalded as thoroughly as possil)le, and sterilizing with live 
steam should be done wherever ])racticable. Tlu> water sup])ly 
of the dairy is of great importance, and many large dairy com- 
panies now^ insist Ui)on special examination of the water and 
water-supply before receiving milk from farms. 

Specially constructed milk pails, which, in a lai-ge nica-nre. 



94 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

prevent the dirt and dnst from falling into the milk, are some- 
times nsed, and assist in reducing the contamination of the milk. 

The Transportation and Delivery of Milk. — This 
cannot be fully considered here, but it may be stated that the 
milk should be transported in sterile cans or bottles, that the 
pouring of milk from one can to another or to bottles should 
only be allowed in a room provided especially for that purpose, 
free from dust and other source of contamination. The milk 
should be kept cold the entire time until it reaches the consumer, 
and by him until used. The selling of milk from open cans in 
grocery and provision shops should be prohibited. The safest 
method of marketing milk is in sealed bottles, and, unless some 
other solution of the problem offers, this should be the only 
way. Selling from cans, the way it is done in the United States, 
is open to a number of objections, but the public has not been 
educated to demand pure bottled milk, although much has been 
done in this direction. 

The Handling- and Care of Milk. — As we have seen, 
the production of milk reasonably free from bacteria is a ques- 
tion of cleanliness, and the question of handling it is reduced to 
cleanliness of utensils, protection of the milk from contamina- 
tion by dust and dirt, and keeping it cool. The milk should b.i 
cooled immediately after milking, and this is most conveniently 
accomplished by using a milk cooler, of which there are many 
diiferent models, using cold water, and it should be kejit cold 
until used. A^arious devices for keeping milk by heating it to 
over 110° F. have been advised, but while most bacteria will 
not grow at this tem]:>erature, some undoubtedly do, and having 
-cen severe diarrheas caused in infants by keeping milk warm at 
night, we advise against this practice in the present state of our 
knowledge f)f ])acteria growing at high temperatures. 

The Adulteration of Milk. — The most frequent adulter- 
ation of milk consists in removing ])art of the cream and adding 
water. In other instances good milk and skim milk are mixed 
together. Tn both instances the consumer is rob1)ed by ])aying 
for an article of f(jo(l which does not have the mitritive value it 
is commonly supposed to possess. The addition of water ])rings 
the added danger of contaniiiiating tlie milk, as a milk dealci- 
sufficiently unscru])ulous to add water to his milk would be apt 
to disregard the character of water u.-ed, and, as a matter of fact, 
a numi)er of ty})hoid epidemics have been caused in this way. 
Milk is artificially colored, but this ])ractice is not as common as 
is po])ularly sup])osed. Almo.-t all eonmnniities have laws lor- 
bidding the adulteration of milk in this way.

The Use of Preservatives. — Clicmical prcscrvative.s arc 
frequently added to milk to prevent the irrouth of ])act('i-ia, and 
it is fre(|nently done alter the milk is partialK- spcyilcd. The 
most commonly used artieles are fornialdchyd, horic acid, Ixna.x, 
salicylic acid, and benzoic acid. J)Ul small amounts are needed 
to check the growth of bacteria, but the unscrupulous deal< r 
usually adds a great deal. jMilk which does not >our in a rea- 
sonable length of time under favorable conditions i'oi* souiiiiL; 
should be tested for preservatives. The use oi" all -uch pre-( r\- 
atives should be prohil)ited by law. ^J'lie so-called IJuddei/ed 
milk has had hydrogen peroxid added to it, which sterilize- it, 
and the peroxid is gradually decomposed into oxygen and \\ater. 
This ])rocess is not to be commended. 

The ^Examination of Milk. — The milk should l)e thor- 
oughly mixed so as to obtain a fair sample, but if the i'at sepa- 
rates in small lumps of butter, another sample should be secui-ed. 
Milk should adhere slightly to the sides of the glass from which 
it is poured, and not run off like water. 

Fat Tests. — The Babcock test is the best method, but re- 
quires the use of a centrifugal machine ; small ones, however, 
may be obtained for office use. The amount of fit in the milk 
may be definitely determined in ten or fifteen minutes by using 
tliis test, which is made by putting a definite amount of milk or 
cream in a special graduated bottle, adding sulphuric acid, and 
shaking the mixture until it becomes dark in color, then ])laeiiig 
the bottle in a centrifugal machine and running it until the fit is 
entirely separated. The exact ])ercentage can be i"ead oil' after 
adding sufficient warm water to bring the fit upto the graduation 
on the bottle. A simple method, but not a very jiccurate one, is 
to use a creamometer, which is a tall, graduated glass cylinder. 
This is filled with milk and allowed to stand fe^r aliout twi'uty- 
four hours. The })rocess may be hastened by heating to Umi 
F. and then placing the creamometer in cold water, Anotlier 
method is to fill tlie creamometer half full of milk and then add 
warm water. The reading will in this case have to be doubled. 

The Specific Gravity. — This is best taken by the (^le- 
venne lactometer, which has a thermometer enclosed in it which 
shows both the specific gravity and temperature of the milk. 
The milk, to get accurate and uniform results, is testi'd at (in- 
F. The specific gravity of milk varies between 1.0i^*J and 
1.033, and sometimes there are great variations. The s}>ecilie 
gravity may be increased if the cream is removed, and if water 
is added the specific gravity is decreased. A favorite method 
of adulterating milk is to remove part of the cream and then add 



96 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

sufficient water to make the specific gravity normal. The lactom- 
eter shows only the specific gravity of the milk, and while some- 
times adulteration may ])e detected by it, it is not a certain test. 

^Estimation of Protein. — Boggs ^ has suggested the fol- 
lowing test : 

Use phosphotungstic acid, 25 grams, and distilled water, 125 
cc; after thorough solution is obtained there is added hydro- 
chloric acid (cone), 25 cc, diluted with distilled water, 100 cc. 
This yields 250 cc. of a 10 per cent, solution of phosphotungstic 
acid in about 3 per cent, hydrochloric acid. The solution is 
quite stable if kept in a dark bottle and gives satisfactory re- 
sults after months of standing. It is desirable that the compo- 
nents be mixed as indicated, /. e., the well diluted hydrochloric 
acid added after solution of the phosphotungstic acid, in order to 
avoid precipitation. 

The sample of milk to be tested is diluted with water, using 
standard pipets and flasks to secure maximum accuracy. Es- 
bach's tables of standard patterns reading from 1 to 7 grams 
per liter are more satisfactory. 

The diluted milk is poured into the tube to the mark IT, being 
careful to read from the bottom of the meniscus. The phospho- 
tungstic acid solution is added to the mark K, the tube corked, 
and slowly inverted twelve times to secure thorough mixing, 
care being had to avoid shaking roughly and thus mixing air in 
the fluid. The tube is tlien ])laccd in a rack for twenty-four 
hours, and the percentage read off at the level of the top of the 
precipitate. Fractions of jKTcentage l^etween the graduations 
are readily judged by the eye. At dilutions of one j)art in ten, 
percentage of ])rotein is read directly from the scale, while if the 
solution be one in twenty, we multiply the reading by two, if 
one in five, we divide by two. 

The o])timum dilution f )r luiman milk is 1 in 10. That for 
cows' milk, 1 in 20. If the protein content be found extremely low 
we may use 1 in 5 i'ov human milk and 1 in 10 for cows' milk. 

As temperature lias a definite influence on the volume of the 
jnx'cipitate, it is desirable that the tubes be not exposed to ex- 
tremes, although the differences noted in this preci])itate were 
not nearly so gnjat as when Ksbach's solution was used. 

Xo considerable vai'iation was found in volume of ])recij)i- 
tates, with temperatures ranging between 15^—25° (\(5i>"— 
77" v.), while in thermostat at .■>7° (\ all iloate<l, and in the 
ice-box at 5'^ ('. Ml ^ V.) all read a])preeial)ly higher than at 
I'oom temperatures, averaging 20^ (\ ((iS F.).

four hours. 

Tests. — The Acid Test. — From the time nf milking' until it 
sours the acidity of milk is constantly incrcasini:, and whih- no 
definite standard has been adopted as the maximum aci<lilv 
which should be ae(;epted by a consumei*, it furni>h('< a sim|)lc 
means of testing milk. Farrington, of Wisconsin, ha- had 
tablets made of a definite (juantity of some alkah, >nch as 
caustic j)otash or so(hi, containino- a litth' phcnolphthalcin, 
which is colorless in acid solutions and pink in alkalin<' -ohitiuu^. 
The tablets are made of such strenuth tliat if tN\(» of tlicm turn 
one ounce of milk pink, such milk, with })ropcr care, shoidd 
keep a reasonable length of time. 

Hydrogen peroxid may be detected in milk by the u-c ol" a 
solution of titannic acid (titannium hydrate) di.-.-oKcd in -ul- 
phuric acid. This is added to a few cubic centimeter- of milk, 
and if the ])eroxid is present coloration apjx^ars, but varie- 
between a light yellow and a dee[) orange, according to the 
amount of peroxid present. A somewhat similar reaction 
takes place from milk containing salicylic acid. 

Formaldehyd is best tested by using either Ilclmer's or 
Leach's test. They are based on the ap})earance of a violet 
color when concentrated sul})huric acid or hydrochloric acid 
containing a trace of iron is added to the milk. 

Hehner's Test. — To a few cubic centimeters of concentrated 
suljihuric acid, to. which a trace of some ferric salt has been 
added, add the milk to be tested so as to form a distinct layer 
on top of the acid and allow to stand. If formaldehyd be 
present, even one part to a million of milk, a violet coloration 
will take })lace at the junction of the two licpiids. 

Leach's Method. — Dilute the milk with an equal vohnne of 
water and add for each cubic centimeter of the diluted milk 
1 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid containing 1 cc. of 10 
per cent, ferric chlorid solution to each oOO cc. of acid. The 
mixture is heated in a casserole over the bare flame to SO^ or 
90° C, rotating to break the curd which forms. If formalde- 
hyd be present, a violet color will ap})ear. 

Cream. — When milk is allowed to stand undi.-turbed, the 
fat droplets, being of lower si)ecitic gravity than the remainder 
of the milk, gradually rise t(» the top, and the longx^- the milk 
stands, up to a certain limit, the more cream will be found. As 
far as the composition of cream goes, it is most ea-ily remem- 
bered as regarding it as milk containing a large amouut oi' lat.

purposes about the same as in milk or a little lower. Creams 
are usually spoken of with reference to the amount of fat 
which they contain, so one speaks of a 16 per cent, cream, 20

The cream which rises on average milk after twenty-four 
hours usually contains about 16 per cent, fat, and is spoken of 
as gravity cream. Some gravity cream may contain as much 
as 18 or 20 per cent. fat. The richer creams are obtained by 
centrifugalizing the milk. This has the advantage that cream 
may be put on the market a short time after milking, but it 
has the disadvantage that the fat globules may be broken up 
and fused, so that a thin layer of fat may be found on top 
of the bottle. 

The upper part of the cream, after standing, is richer in fat 
than the lower part, and this is true of the milk taken as a 
whole. Tlie variations are well shown in the following table

The fat dro})lets in cream vary in size in the different varie- 
ties of cows. In the Alderneys and Guernseys the (h-oplets are 
larger, less uniform in size, and more numerous than in milk 
from the ordinary milcli cow. The small uniform i'at (h-oplcts 
of milk from average herds is to be luvlcrred in infant feeding. 
Ordinarily, if average milk has stood until the cream has risen, 
the upper third of the milk in the bottle will contain about 10 
per cent, fat and the upi)er half about 7 per cent. i'at. Cream

Devonshire creatn is more or less solid clotted creatn, 
obtained by skimming milk after it has been heated slowly to not

is very nutritious, but less digestible than ordinary cream. 

Butter. — Butter is made from milk by churning, which 
causes the fat globules in the milk to coalesce, thus forming a 
solid mass. Occasionally butter is made from other milk than 
that of the cow. Butter is made most rapidly from cream that 
has been ripened from twelve to twenty-four hours, and churned 
at a temperature between 65° and 70° F. In this way butter may 
be separated in from twelve to thirty minutes. The ]n'oce-s of 
ripening has been carefully studied, and it has been found that 
the bacterial flora of a creamery varies with the season of the 
year, and also the taste and odor of the butter varies con-e<- 
pondingly. Instead of depending on chance bacterial invasions 
of the milk, which may ])roduce at times unpleasant flavor^, it 
is the practice in many creameries to inoculate the milk with a 
culture of bacteria known to impart a desirable flavor to the 
butter. In this way a saving is brought about and the (piality 
of the butter improved. 

AVhen butter is kept too long it becomes rancid, and ihi- i- 
due chiefly to the fermentation of the small amount of ca-ein 
remaining; in the butter liberating fattv acids. To avoid thi> 
the butter should be kept cold. Salting is largely used lor pre- 
venting this fermentation. The amount \\<v(\ should not exceid 
2 per cent., and it should be worked into the butter >o that 
no undissolved particles remain. The un.-:dted or sweet l)uiter 
is largely used in Europe, but there is not a great demand i'"V 
it in the United States. Butter is often colored, largely becau-e 
the public still like a dark, yellow col(»r. An nolo is largely

used for this purpose. The Uuited States standard for butter 
is that it shall not contain more tliau 1 G j^er cent, of water, nor 
less than 82.5 per cent, of ])iitter fat. Approximately butter

while renovated butter and oleomargarin boil n.oisily and sput- 
ter like a mixture of grease and water, and produce less 
foam. 

The WaferhouHe Test. — Oleomai'garin may also be distin- 
guislied from butter and renovated butter by the AVaterhouse 
test. 

Sweet skimmed milk is used, filing a half-pint cuj) half full, 
then heat this nearly to boiling, and add a slightly rounded tea- 
sj)()onful of the material to l)e tested. Stir with a wooden rod 
and continue heating until the milk l)oils up, then remove from 
the heat and cool in a pan containing rather large fragments of 
ice and a little water. When the cup is placed in the pan the 
water should reach on the outside of the cup to one-fourth of 
the height of tlie milk within. Tlie contents of the cup should 
be stirred rather raj)idly and continuously, and al)out once a 
minute; the cuj) should be moved about in the ice so as to lacill- 
tate cooling. Jf the sample is oleomai'garin the fit gathers into 
one soft lump, and if it is butter the fit becomes gnimilated and 
cannot be collected. A\'hen the test is properly carried out the 
distinction is very marked. 

Buttermilk. — The residue left in the churn i- called l)ut- 
termilk, and is lai-gcly used a.> a bcNcrage, as it is nutritious 
and easily digested. It c()ntains the casein of the milk in a

This is a pleasant, nnti'itions drink, nmch in vogue at the 
present time. It is useful in feeding invalids, especially tlie-e 
with certain forms of gastric and inte-tinal (li-<»rdei'>, and in 
feeding infants. Compressed tablets of lactic acid bacilli may 
be obtained on the market, and, while less satisfactor\- than tin- 
fresh cultures, may be used where the lattei' are unobtainable. 
Conserved buttermilk, made somewhat aftei- the manner of con- 
densed milk, is also used, es]ieciallv f )r inftnt fecchng. Dried 
buttermilk has also been placed on the market. 

Bonnyclabber. — This is soured milk in which the curd and 
whey are served in the same dish, and usually eaten with the 
addition of sugar. Curd and whey or junket is milk where the 
coagulation has been brought about by renui't. In manv in- 
stances the whey is removed and used as a Ibod for in\alid- 
and infants. 

Cheese. — Cheese is made of the curd and a certain pi'opor- 
tion of fat of milk, and varies in composition and consistence ac- 
cording to the method employed in the manufactui'e. The 
simplest form of cheese is the so-ctdled cottage che(>se, in which 
the curd is separated from the whey and eaten a short time 
after it is made. The other cheeses are kept a certain length 
of time to insure ripening. Sometimes the coagidation i> pro- 
duced by rennet and sometimes by lactic acid, while \aii<tu- 
forms of bacteria growing in the cheoe and also certain mould- 
impart to tlie ditierent varieties their peculiar ihiN'ors. Some 
cheeses are hard and some are soft, the ditlercnce bt-ing due to 
the amount of pressure used in hardening them. As a rule. 
the harder cheeses keep very nuich longer than the s(.fter one-. 
The average composition of cheese, as shown by Parks, is as 
follows :

Cheese is a nutritious and agreeable food, but some people 
find it difficult of digestion. As a rule, the harder the cheese, 
the more indigestible it is. Like milk, cheese may contain cer- 
tain poisonous substances due to bacterial action, and severe 
poisoning may follow the eating of such cheese. In recent 
years the study of the manufacture of various cheeses has been 
carried on, so that Roquefort and Cameml)ert and other foreign 
cheeses are imitated with considerable success in the United 
States. The artificial coloring of cheese is still very common in 
the United States, and should be prohibited by law. Cheese is 
sometimes adulterated, and a cheap cheese, known as filled 
cheese, is made l)y adding neutral lard to the milk to replace 
the butter fat. In the United States such cheese is taxed and 
must be branded as such. 

Condensed Milk. — This is manufactured by heating the 
milk to 212° F. to sterilize it and then eva])orating in a vacuum 
until it l)ecomes thick and jelly-like. To this considerable 
amounts of cane-sugar are added. In some cities fresh con- 
densed milk may ])e obtained which has not had sugar added to 
it. The composition of condensed milk is as follows :

(See Infant Feeding.) It should be remembered that e(iii(|(ii-.'d 
milk mav be made from dirty milk, and so be objeeii<.iiabl.', 
and that it may contain large numbers of bacteria. WC ha\c 
found Borden's Eagle Brand satisfactory. Among other l)raiid-, 
the Anglo-Swiss and the Ideal may l)e mentioned. 

Another method of conserving milk, known as the C'amplxll 
method, has been recently introduced, and the ])r()duet i- now 
obtainable in some places. Pure milk is })laced in a cnne.n- 
trating vat and warmed to 14(1° F. A blast of filtered air 
is driven through it for about three hoiu's, or tintil the oi-iginal 
volume is reduced to one-quarter. This is then bottled in 
sterile bottles. It may be used just as it is in cotfee or tea, 
diluted one-half in place of cream, or with three time- the 
amount of water in place of ordinary milk. The milk i- 
marketed nnder the name of A\diite Cross ^lilk. 

Predigestion of Milk. — Milk may be partly or wholly 
predigested in order to render it more easily digestible for 
individuals suffering from gastro-intestinal disorders. This pi^tc- 
ess is readily accomplished by adding an active pi'cparation ot 
})epsin to acidulated milk, and allowing the iermentatiou h> 
])roceed nnder the influence of heat at the l)ody-tempei'ature by 
immersion in hot water. During this Icrmentation the ca-ein 
is partly or completely converted into albumoscs. If the pnu-- 
ess is allowed to continue too long, the milk becomes bitter. 
For this reason it is ordinarily removed irom the hot waiei' 
after a few minutes, and is ])laced upon ice, which pre\-eiit- 
further fermentation. In order to ])redig(\-t milk in alkaline 
solution pancreatin is substituted for pc])sin ; pancreatization of 
milk has now largely replaced peptonization. Jn order to etl'ect 
pancreatization of milk Fairchild's peptonizing tubes are 
ordinarily employed. These tul)es contain live grains of ])an- 
creatic extract and fifteen grains of sodium bicarbonate. ]-]ach 
tube contains suflicient powder to digest one pint of milk. 



104 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

Another easy method of partially pancreatiziDg milk is by the 
use of Fairchild's ])cptogenic milk powder. First dissolve the 
powder in the water by rubbino; and stirring with a spoon, then 
add the milk and cream ; mix well ; heat in a saucepan, with 
constant stirring until blood-warm — not too hot to be agreeably 
borne by the mouth ; keep at about this temperature for ten 
minutes ; then bring quickly to boiling-point ; pour at once into 
clean bottle, shake thoroughly, cork tightly, and place directly 
on ice or in a very cold place. 

Where the taste of pancreatlzed milk proves ol)j('Ctionable, 
the addition of carbonated waters, or of small quantities of 
coffee, may render it more pahitable. 

The digestibility of milk may be increased by the addition of 
hot or cold water, carbonated waters, such as Vichy or Apc>lli- 
naris, lime-water, oatmeal or barley-water, or farinaceous foods, 
such as arrow-root or flour ; occasionally small quantities of salt 
or sodium ])icarbonate are hebpful. 

Kumiss, Kefir, and Mat^oon.— Kumiss is a fermented 
drink pre])ared l)y both lactic acid and alcoholic fermentation. 
For niany centuries it has been made from mares' milk by the 
natives living near the shores of the Caspian Sea. The milk 
is obtained from a special lu'eed of mares, the animals being fed 
very carefully. The milk is mixed with a kumiss ferment, the 
lactic acid ferment converting some of the >ugar into lactic acid, 
while auotlicr ])art of tlie sugar is converted into alcohol and 
carbonic acid ; a small quantity of casein is digested. The milk 
is constantly agitated, and the fermentation allowed to proceed 
for a period of twenty-four hours or more. 

Kumiss is an acid, eiiervescing drink, and contains a very 
small proportion of alcohol. It is very easily digested, l)eiug 
much more digestible than milk. The; casein is so finely divided 
that luiiqis cannot be formed in the stomach, and it is easily 
acted upon l)v tlie gastric secretion. In the United States it has 
been pre})ared from cows' milk, to which the ferment has been 
added. 

Kumiss Cure. — In certain ])arts of Kussia this form of cure 
is not unconuiiou. It consists in di'inking small (juautities of 
kumi>s and gradually increasing them until large; (pianlitles are 
taken. Kiuniss cui'es ha\(3 been ])rescril)ed in chronic gas- 
tro-intestinal e;it:in-lis and chronic catarrhs of the res])iratory 
tract. 

Kefir resembles kunil-s, and i< (»i'ten w-^cd as a -ub-litute for 
it. It was oi-iginallv made in the ( auea-us iVnni cows' milk

mentation going on at the same time. Ale* .hoi, lactic acid, mimI 
albnmins are formed as a result of the I'crmcniativc ])roc(—( -. 
The casein is partly digested. Tableis of th" kclir Icnnciit 
have been prepared by Jurock, and are sold under the nau'.' 
of kefilac tablets. Tluy^ render the home manufacture (»f kdir 
an easy matter. (See Ifecipes.) 

Yoghurt Milk. — Yoghurt has been used in the East fnr a 
long time, but has only recently been intnxhiced in thi> countr\ . 
It is a sour Bulgarian milk, and is highly nutritinu.-, ami can 
be used as a sul)stitute for koumiss or kefir. The ieniientaiiou 
in this form of milk is generated by a ferment of a mixture of 
forms of bacteria containing mainly the liacillus l)ul-ari<'as. 

The composition of yogluirt is : Protein, 7.1 , -uiiar, U. ♦- 
fats, 7.20; salts, 1. :^. 8 ; 'alcohol, 0.20; lactic aci<l, O.s. Yog- 
hurt is very digestible, inasnnich as the casein and albumin 
contained therein are rendered solubk' aspeptones and aibumo^e-, 
and the lime salts are in solution to G8 per cent. 

This preparation of milk has become especially prominent, 
due to the fact that Metchnikoif describes a lii'e-prolonging ei'e't 
to it, basing this belief on the fact that in Bulgaria, where ynoliui't 
is much used, a large number of consmners of this preparation 
are said to live above 100 years of age. While the conclu-ie";- 
of Metchnikoif are probably not entirely correct, it is a well- 
known fact that individuals often thrive on this f )od, an<l the de- 
composition in the intestin.e is favorably influenced 1-y it. Prep- 
arations much like yoghurt maybe ])re])ared I'rom the PulLiarian 
bacillus tablets made by the various manufacturing chemi.-ir. 

Matzoon. — In this form of milk lactic acid i< ]>rodnced b;/ 
fermentation with a ferment obtnined from Syria. Jt is tliicki r 
than kumiss and does not contain alcohol. 

Kumiss, kefir, and matzoon are agreeable forms of milk ftml-. 
are easily digestible, and are es])ecially useful in those ca-e- in 
which milk cannot be taken or is not well borne. I'he fnllcN'.-

EGGS, 

Eggs, like milk, form a complete food — that is, they contain 
a proportion of each of the fundamental food elements neces- 
sary for the preservation of life. Eggs and milk are the only 
complete food-products furnished by the animal kingdom. 

The eggs of the hen are consumed in largest numbers, but 
those of the duck, turkey, guinea-hen, and of some wild fowl 
are also eaten. The eggs of domestic fowls vary in size and 
appearance, but their composition is about the same. 

The shell of a hen's egg constitutes 11 parts, the white 57 
parts, and the yolk 32 parts of the entire weight of the egg. 
The following table, taken from Langwortliy,^ shows the com- 
position of hens' eggs, cooked and raw ; of white-shelled and 
of brown-shelled eggs ; and of the yolk and white of the egg 
of the duck, goose, turkey, and guinea-fowl :

As may be seen from the foregoing table, the egg contains 
mainly protein and fats, in addition to water and mineral 
matter. The white and the yolk differ in composition, the 

^ P\rniei-s' ]>ulk'tin No. 128, United States Department of Agriculture. 



AXfMAL FOODS. 107 

white containing less protein and water than the yolk, and 
scarcely any fat and ash, whereas the yolk eontains eonsidt-rahlc 
fat and ash. The white is said to be pure protein ; it is corn- 
posed mainly of fonr all)uinins and a sli<rht amount of carho- 
hydrate. The albumins are ovalbinnin, conalbumin, ovonnicin, 
and ovomncoid, the ovalbumin being the main con-titucnt. 
The yolk of the egg is very complex in eom|)osition, and con- 
tains 15 per cent, of protein (vitellinj, 20 ])cr cent, of palmi- 
tin, olein, and stearin (the fatty elements), and O.o per cent, 
of coloring-matter, besides lecithin, nuclein, salts of iron, cal- 
cium, potassium, and magnesium; the total ])lios|)liorus c(juiva- 
lent in the yolk is slightly over 1 per cent., while that oC tlu- 
white is but 0.03 per cent. The shell of the hen's egg has no 
food-value; it consists mainly of mineral matter eontaininij: IM 
per cent, of calcium carbonate. 

The flavor of the egg is de})endent in large mi^asure upon the 
food eaten by the laying hen. Fresh e^ir^^ have the finest flavor. 
Laugworthy ^ giv^es the following methods for testing the iVesh- 
ness of eggs : ^^ ' Candling/ as it is called, is one oi' the method- 
most commonly followed. The eggs are held u]) in a suitable 
device against a light. The fresh eg:ix. appears unclouded and 
almost translucent ; if incubation has begun, a dark spot is visi- 
ble, wdiich increases in size according to the length of time ineii- 
bation has continued. A rotten egg a])pears dark colored. The 
age of eggs may be approximately judged by taking advantage 
of the fact that as they grow old their density decreases through 
evaporation of moisture." According to Siebel, a new-laid 
egg placed in a vessel of brine made in the proportion of two 
ounces of salt to one pint of water will at once sink to ilu' 
bottom. An qq-q: one dav old will sink below the surface, but 
not to the bottom, while one three days old will swim about just 
immersed in the liquid. If more than three days old, the vgg 
will float on the surface, the amount of slu^ll exposed increas- 
ing with age. If the egg is two weeks old, only a little of the 
shell will dip in the liquid. Penzoldt " gives the following tabh^ 
showing the digestibilitv of eugs : 

2 soft-boiled eggs leave the stomacli in 1^ liours. 

2 i-aw eggs leave the stomach in 2\ hours. 

2 poached eggs and 5 grams of butter leave tlie stomach in '21 hours. 

2 hard-boiled eggs leave the stomach in o hours. 

2-egg omelet leaves the stomach in o houi-s.

The fact that raw eggs remain in the stomach longer than 
soft-boiled egg^ is due to the fact that they are so bland that 
they excite neither the motor nor the secretory function ; if 
thoronglily masticated, hard-boiled eggs are as digestible as 
soft-boiled ones. AYith some ])ersons eggs in any form are 
indigestible, and produce unpleasant eructations, nausea, and 
headache. 

Raw eggs are best taken directly from the shell, or they 
may be combined with milk broths or with coifee. In various 
diseases accompanied by loss of flesh and strength raw eggs in 
large numbers are prescribed, as many as 24 eggs being given 
in twenty-f )ur hours.^ 

!^g'g- albumin is best absorbed when eaten raw and ])rop- 
erly dihited. Its palatability may be increased l)y flavoring it 
with sherry wine, orange, lemon, or grape juice, or by serving 
it in cream, cocoa, or coffee. 

^g"g=liOg" is ])rej)ared from milk and eggs, flavored with 
some alcoholic drink, and sweetened Avith sugar. 

AVh.en allowed to remain in the air, cgg6 decompose from 
the entrance of germs through their shell. I)ecompositk)n 
may be prevented in various ways, such as by coating them 
with oil or varnish, packing them in sawdust, or placing them 
in cold storage or in certain solutions, such as salicylic acid 
and glycerin. 

MEATS AND THE MEAT PREPARATIONS, 

Meat forms the fleshy or nuiscular ])arts of the l)ody. It is 
one of tlie most important articles of food, and is the chief 
source of man's protein supply. Meat may be eaten raw 
or cooked. Raw meat, when well ground, is very easily 
digested. 

Meat is composed of muscle-fibers held together by connec- 
tive-tissue bands ; between the muscle-fibers are bits of fit. 
As ordinarily seen, meat contains muscle tissue, connective 
tissues, blood-vessels, nerves, and lymphatics, together with a 
varying amount of fit. The more fat there is in meat, the less 
water and nitrogenons matter does it contain, and vice verm. 
Cooking has the effect of rendering the connective tissues solu- 
})1(', there])y causing a se])aration of the nmscular fibers, allow- 
ing the digestive secretion to mingle more thoroughly with 
them. Co(»king also (Mihancc^ the flavor and appc^arance of the

ANLVAL FOODS. 101! 

meat, but, on the other hand, causes a loss in fat and extrar- 
tives. Cooking likewise destroys the inicro-orji^anisnis tlial 
may be present in the meat, and thus renders it more whoh'- 
some. 

Meat may be cooked in various ways — it mav be boiled, 
stewed, roasted, or fried. Meat is boiled by placini:; it in cold 
water and subjecting it to a moderate heat lor souk.' time. In 
this way the connective tissue becomes gelatinized, and a por- 
tion of the organic salts, albumin, and extractive^ is di>-olved. 
The longer the process is allowed to continue, the more taste- 
less does the meat become and the richer is the broth. This 
tasteless mass of meat has a high nutritive value, and, eoFn- 
bined wdth the broth, constitutes a nutritious ibod. The 
process of stewing meat is acconn)lished by ))laeing the meat 
in boiling water, by means of which the albumin on the surface 
is quickly coagulated, thus preventing the juice irom escaping 
and so retaining the flavoring matter; the broth that is pro- 
cured in this way is very poor in quality. Meat is roasted by 
placing it in a very hot oven, the superficial layers thus be- 
coming immediately coagulated, and so preventing escaj)e ol" 
the juice. To broil meat, small bits are cooked over an open 
fire, the albumin of the surface being thus not only coagulated, 
but the inner fibers being cooked at the same time. Frying 
is accomplished by placing the meat in boiling oil ; the surface 
albumin is at once coagulated, the juice is prevented from 
escaping, and the meat is rapidly cooked. 

Digestibility of Meats. — The digestibility of meats is 
governed by many conditions : The age at which the animals 
eaten were killed, the length of time the meat is kept before 
eating, the care bestowed upon the animals during life, and the 
methods of preparing the meats for the table. ^Feats are most 
easily digested when stewed; frying renders them most indi- 
gestible. The flavor of meat varies with the condition of the 
animal from which it was obtained. The meat of matun^ ani- 
mals is more pronounced and agreeable in flavor than that of 
younger cattle. 

The following table, taken from Penzoldt, gives the relative 
digestibility of meat foods :

Beef. — The composition of beef varies greatly, especially in 
regard to the amount of fat and water it contains. An ox from 
three to five years old supplies the best beef. The meat of a 
very lean animal will contain about 75 per cent, of water and 
about 2 per cent, of fat. The water in fat meat is reduced to 
between 50 and 55 per cent., while the fat reaches 2.5 per cent, 
or over. The amount of nitrogenous substances is also con- 
siderably reduced in fat meat. Beef- fat is composed of the 
glycerids of the fatty acids, the ratio being three parts of stearic 
and palmitic acids to one part of oleic acid. 

Meat Preparations. — Numerous meat preparations, both 
solid and liquid, are now on the market, the aim being to pro- 
duce a concentrated food that will be readily digested. The 
different beef-juices have but slight nutritive value, most of 
them containing only 4 or 5 per cent, of protein ; their chief 
value lies in the fact that they stimulate the appetite. 

Bouillons. — Bouillons are prepared by cutting meat into 
small bits, heating slowly in water for a time, and then boiling 
it quickly. The fluid thus produced has a very agreeable flavor, 
but its nutrient value is exceedingly small, as it contains only 
extractives, salts, and a very minute quantity of gelatin. Bouil- 
lons increase the flow of tlie digestive secretions, and can be 
rendered more nutritious by the addition of an Qgg, certain 
cereals, or vegetables. 

Beef-extracts. — Beef-extracts are concentrated bouillons 
that are to l)e diluted at the time they are taken. Their nutri- 
tive vainc is alxnit the same as that of bouillon. 

Beef-juice. — To ])roduce a nutritious liquid beef prepara- 
tion the meat should be boiled slightly and then cut into small 
pieces and ])ressed through a lemon-squeezer or a meat-press. 
In this way considerable quantities of ])rotein, in addition to 
the salts and extractives, are obtained. The beef-juices sold on 
the market, such as Valentine's, are prepared by subjecting the 



ANIMAL FOODS. 



Ill 



meat to strong pressure. These preparations contain IVom 5 
to 10 per cent, of ])rotein. 

Meat Powders. — Tlie nutritive value oi" ilioc idvparatioii- 
varies greatly. Those most i'r('(jU('ntly ux'd arc a nuinlxr of 
pe])tones, Somatose, and the Moscjucra '' Jjccf Meal/' 

Meat -jellies. — Meat-jellies are l'rc(jucntly uiven to invalid-, 
and are an agreeable means of administering ])i-<)iein food. 
Although they do not entirely re])laee the protein in the ti->nes, 
they produce a considerable (juantity of energy. Aec(.rding to 
Bauer, ^^ By the addition of gelatin very large (plant iti<'s of 
albumin can be spared in the body or devoted to increase of 
bulk, just as by the sup])ly of fats and carbohydrates." Meat- 
jelly is, therefore, a protein-sparer. Among those nio-t e«.iii- 
monly employed are calf 's-foot and calf 's-head jelly.

centage composition of beef-products :

AXLVAL FOODS. 11:) 

Veal. — Yoal is toiiii:li and ln(lio(">til)l(>, ("specially wlicn (.h- 
taiiK'tl from animals that arc killed too \nniiL!. It diiTci- 
considerably in tlavor iVom hccj", and contain- inor<' gelatin than 
the latter. As in many ])ersons veal ha- a tendene\- to )>ro(hice 
indiij^estion, it is to be avoided in all ea>e> of diLi(-li\-e debiliiw 

Mutton. — jVIiitton is eonsidei'ed nioiv di-e-lible than Ixel" 
by Knglish writers, ])robably because in l^ll^land the asciaLic 
mutton is more tender than that obtained in the I'liitcd State- ; 
the beef, however, is inierior to that raised in this coiniti'\-. It- 
liber is finer, but it contains more I'at than doe> bed'. Mntlon 
fat contains a larger pro])ortion of glycerid- ol' -tearic acid, 
which makes it more solid and less di^icstiblc than the tat of 
beef. 

I/amb. — Lamb, when of the right age and tenderne.-.-, i- a- 
digestible as beef or mutton, l)ut it contains entii'cK' too much 
lilt. 

Venison. — Uidess obtained from young animals, when it 
is tender, bigbly liavored, and short-iibered, venison is apt to 
be difficult of digestion. On account of its stimidating action 
it should be avoided by dyspeptics and others with weak 
stomachs. 

Pork. — Pork is the most indigestible of all meats on ac- 
count of the large percentage of fat that it contains. This fat 
consists chiefly of the glycerids of })almitic and oleic acids, and 
may be present in the proportion of oT per cent, or more. 

Ham and Bacon. — Ham and bacon are l)oth more digesti- 
ble than pork. In some parts of Germany ham ])lays (juite an 
important part in invalid dietaries, but in England and America 
it is seldom prescribed. Bacon is used largely as an army 
ration. AVhen cooked crisp, thin slices of bacon are easily 
digested. 

Horse Meat. — Horse meat is not us(h1 for food in the 
United States or in England, btit is consumed in laigc (|uanti- 
ties in France and Germany, and to a less extent in some other 
En ro] )ea n conn t ri es . 

Rabbit. — When young, ra])bit meat is (piite digestible, but 
it is usually omitted from diet-lists. 

Fowl. — Chicken is one of the most digc-tible and agree- 
able varieties of meats. The meat of young ])igeons al>o i- 
especially digestible; that of ducks and geese contains too 
much fat. 

The flesh of game is easily digested, the meat of the breast 
being beet adapted for invalid use.

FISH. 

The different kinds of fish vary ^vi(lely in their nutritive and 
digestive qualities. For example, the flounder and tlie oy.-ier 
are much easier of digestion than those that contain a l;iri2:e 
amount of fat, like the salmon and the herring. Eels contain 
the greatest proportion of fat, which may raich 28 ])er cent. 
AVhite-fleshed fish, as a rule, contains little fat. 

All fish are best in season ; out of season they lose tlavor 
and have a diminished nutritive value, and in some cases de- 
velop an offensive od(^r. These clianges are du<^ chiefly to tlic 
chaiige in food. Fish are in best condition just before s])nwn- 
ing ; after this process they become thin and unfit for food. 
The flavor of some varieties, such as the ray and the tiirbot, i- 
improved by keeping. 

On account of the rapid changes they undergo ])y way of 
decomposition, fish should always be e^iten in as fresh a condi-

tion as possible. Various methods have been resorted to with 
a view to preventing these changes. There are many modern 
contrivances for preserving fish, and drying, smoking, pickling, 
salting, and canning are practised on a large scale. These 
methods all modify the flavor more or less. 

There are several varieties of iish that are poisonous. These 
are, however, confined chiefiy to tropical waters. The parasites 
that may be present in fish are destroyed during the cooking, 
l^tomain-poisoning is of rather rare occurrence. 

The following table, taken from Langworthy,' gives the com- 
position of the fish most commonly eaten :

Crustaceans. — The mo.'^t popular of tlic cru-taccans ai'c

and the lobster are especially apt to brino- on nau.<(>a, vomit iItL^ 
and other and more distressing conditions. 

Shellfish. — Oysters, clams, and mussels ai'e the fbrni- (A' 
shellfish chiefly eaten. Oysters, when eaten fVc-h and raw. 
constitute the most digestible animal food, l)ut when cookiMJ. 
their digestive value is much lowered. The soft ])ai't is propor- 
tionately larger and more nutritious tlian the cni-re^j^ondiiiLi' 
portion of the clam. The hard or muscular portion is totiL^i

and rather indigestible, and is best omitted from invalid dieta- 
ries. Oysters should never be fried for the sick. It may be 
well here to call attention to the practice of '^fattening" 
oysters for the market ; this is done by placing them in either 
fresh or salt water for a definite length of time, which gives 
them a fresh and plump appearance. If the water used for 
this purpose contains sewage, contamination is sure to follow. 
Oysters have in many cases been the carriers of typhoid fever, 
and many persons have been infected in this way. 

Clams are a popular article of diet, and are as agreeable to 
most palates as oysters. Mussels are consumed chieiiy by the 
poorer classes in the seaport towns of England.

Vegetables do, however, contain a certain amount of proteins 
and fats ; some are rich in proteins, others in fats. 

Carbohydrates of Vegetables. — These are starches and 
sugars. Starch is found in all plauts, and is converted into 
dextrin by means of dry heat or by cooking. The starch- 
granules in vegetables are held together by a cellulose frame- 
work. Cellulose is a carbohydrate, but is very insoluble ; it 
can be utilized as a food only when young ; when old, it is 
resistant and can not be digested, and hinders digestion of 
the starches enveloped by it. Besides the st^irch and cellulose, 
another form of carbohydrate, known as pectin, is present in 
some vegetable foods. When fruit is cooked, this ])ectin gel- 
atinizes, and the jelly when digested is converted into a certain 
form of sugar. Sugars are also important carbohydrates f )imd 
in vegetables. (The reader is referred to p. 13(i for a detailed 
description of sugars.) 

Protein in Vegetables. — These proteins belong mainly 
to the globulins, but in addition vegetables contain a large 
number of nitrogenous substances that are not proteins. Am(Mig 
the various proteins in vegetables are gluten, as foiuid especially 
in flour, legumen found in the legumes, and vegetable protein 
found in vegetable juices. 

iJ^xtractiveS in Vegetables. — There is a considerable 
amount of extractive matter in certain vegetables, sueli as 
asparagus, which is not utilized in the body. 

Fats in Vegetables. — The fats in vegetables are chiefly 
in the form of oils. In addition, vegetal)les contain a consider- 
able amount of water and salt. The amount of water varies 
^ Food in Henlth and Disecsf, p. Gij.

between 70 and 90 per cent. The main mineral constituents 
are the salts of potassium and sodium united with organic acids. 
Dig-estibility of Vegetables. — The digestion of vege- 
tables takes place mainly in the intestine. Owing to the 
greater bulk of vegetable food and to the cellulose that sur- 
rounds vegetable cells and thus prevents the ready access of the 
digestive juices, vegetable food is not so easily digested as animal 
food. (For an account of the absorbability of vegetable foods the 
reader is referred to p. 38.) For convenience of description 
the following classification of vegetable foods has been adopted ; 

1. Cereals. 5. Fruits. 

2. Legumes. 6. Nuts. 

3. Eoots and tubers. 7. Fungi. 

4. Green vesretables. 8. Lichens. 



CEREALS. 



Cereals are the most important food-products derived from 
the vegetable kingdom. Of this class of foods those in com- 
monest use are wheat, corn, rye, oats, barley, rice, and buck- 
wheat. The cereals are eaten chiefly after having been ground 
into flour or meal. Flour is most commonly made from wheat 
and rye, whereas corn and oats are the chief sources of meal. 
Corn is also eaten in large quantities whole, and barley and rice 
are also eaten in this way. The following table ^ gives tlie 
chemic composition of the most common cereals :

Wheat is the most important source of flour, owing to the 
fact that it can be raised in imy tcmjxTatc climate and yields 
the best flour at the least ex])ense. It is rich in solids and con- 
tains little water. The wheat-Lcrnin is covered by six layers, 
which form the bran. Of these six, the three outermost coats

form the skin, and tlie reniaininu^ llirce layers the cnvdo)) (»!' 
the gram. The outermost layer is called the testa ; the inner- 
most, or cereal hiyer, takes its name from the eerealin which it 
contiiins. AVithin the eerealin layer, and adjacent t<< tiie cml)rv(», 
lies the endosperm, which contains the siai-ch. 'I'hc cnihi-No 
lies at the lower end of the gi-ain. 'i'he h\-e outer l;i\cr> are 
composed chiefly of celhdose. The cei-eal layer i- the richc-t 
in nitrogenous substances. The endosperm couiain^ a lai-iic 
amount of starch, a nitrogenous substance calle<l ghiien, -oine 
sugar, and the cellulose of its cell-wall. 

Flour is made by grinding the grain of the vai'ion- cereal-. 
Although flour is made chiefly from wheat and rve; bai-lev, oats, 
maize, etc., are also manufactured into Hour. 

Bread is made by adding to flour a definite ])roj)ortion of 
water, a little salt, and the leavening agent. The mixture or 
dough is then kneaded, either with the hands oi\ better, with a 
spoon. In the large modern bakeries the kneading is done en- 
tirely by machinery. After this the dough is set aside for a 
number of hours, during which time fermentation takes |)lace. 
It is then molded into loaves and baked. The leavcsning is 
dependent upon the action of the yeast on the starch, some of 
wdiich it converts into sugar, and then into alcohol and carlxai 
dioxid gas. The gas causes bnbl)les to apjiear throughout the 
dough, and renders it light and sj^ongy. louring the baking 
process the yeast germs are killed and the alcohol and carboni(; 
acid gas are driven off. Plot or fresh bread, when masticated, 
forms a tenacious, doughy mass, and hence is not so digestii>l(! 
as stale bread, or bread that has been allowed to dry slightly, 
for the latter will crumble into fine particles and so is moi-e 
thoroughly mixed with the gastric juice. Toasting bread makes 
it more dig'estible. A slice of bread remains in the stomach 
about two and one-half hours. 

Next to wdieat bread, which thus far has alone been men- 
tioned, rye bread is the most important of the bread<tutl<. 
While it is not so digestible for invalids as wheat bread, it is 
more laxative and keeps fresh longer than wheat bread. \\ heat 
and rye flour are often mixed in bread-making. 

Pumpernickel is a whole-rye bread made by the Germans. 
It is slightly laxative. Gluten bread is made from gluten flour, 
and is used chiefly by diabetics. The best bread contains from 
40 to 50 per cent, of gluten. l>iscuits, ]Kistries, and pudding- 
are made by adding to the flour varying (piantities of egLi's, 
sugar, milk, butter, fruit, flavoring extracts, etc. Thty vai'y 
widely in richness and digestibility, and are to be avoided l»y 
persons with weak digestion. 



122 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

Buckwheat flour is often made into batter-cakes in the 
United States, but in some parts of Russia buckwheat porridge 
forms the principal cereal food. Bread made from buckwheat 
crumbles and does not keep well. 

Millet is largely used in India, China, and Russia. 

Sorgfhum is occasionally made into bread, but in America 
it is grown usually for the molasses and syrup that may be 
obtained from it. 

Rice constitutes the staple food of many of the peoples of 
the Orient. It is grown chiefly in Asia, but is also raised in 
some parts of Europe. In the United States rice culture is 
confined chiefly to South Carolina. Rice contains a large pro- 
portion of starch in very digestible form, but it is comparatively 
poor in other constituents. 

Barley bread was used for food by the early Greeks and 
Romans, w^ho also used barley meal to a large extent in the 
training of their athletes. Since the introduction of potatoes as 
food, and with the cheapening of wheat flour, barley bread has 
gradually fallen into disuse. Barley-water is used as a beverage 
for invalids and infants. 

Oats contain liberal proportions of fat, protein, and salts, a 
large amount of starch, and considerable indigestible cellulose. 

Oatmeal is used to the best advantage in making porridge ; 
owing to its lack of gluten it makes only the poorest kind of 
bread. What is known as Scotch groats is prepared by freeing 
the grain from its outer husk. Oatmeal porridge is said to act 
as a mild laxative in some j^ersons, and to excite dyspeptic 
symptoms in others. 

Breakfast Foods. — There are a variety of preparations 
made from cereals which have l)een in recent years placed on the 
market, the chief cliaracteristics of which are that they have 
undergone, more or less, preparation for immediate consumption. 
For tlie most part tliey are sold under trade names ; the com- 
position and soui'ce of the food is given in some cases and omit- 
ted in others. Briefly sj>eaking, they contain about the same 
amount of nutriment as the cereals from wliich they are made. 
Their palatability varies consideral)ly and there is no objection 
to tlie use of such articles of diet if freshly ])repared foods are 
ol)tained and tlie individual that consnmes them likes the taste. 
The older ])ackages, unless very careliilly ])ut np, are liable to 
be infected with insects or moulds, both of which render the 
prodnct unfit for food. The chief objection is the cost, which is 
far greater- than the same amount of I'ood })rei)ared I'rom the 
cereal itself. 



VEGETABLE FOODS. 



LEGUMES. 



Of the legumes, the pea and the l)enn are the most important 
food-products. In the middle and nortluTn parts of Kuropr 
the pea is the most popular leirunie, while in the M('dit(.'rran<-:in 
countries the bean predominates. In America jxms and hcaiis 
are extensively raised. The peanut is an American fiivorii^', 
but the lentil is eaten only to a verv small (>xtent. 

The legumes contain a liberal pr(>})()rtion of protein (letrii- 
men), carbohydrates, and a little fat, l)esi(les a laru'e amount of 
water. Although legumes contain a ])ro[)ortion of protein in 
excess of that of meat, a large amoimt of fat, and eonsich-rable 
stiirch, they are less easily digested than animal foods. As 
pointed out by Abel,^ this is due to three reasons : 

"(1) As generally prepared and used, the nutrients of v«'ge- 
table foods are inclosed in cells compose<l of cellulose or W(jo(lv 
fiber, which is more or less hard and greatly interferes with 
their absorption. 

'^ (2) Vegetable food is prone to fermentation in the intes- 
tine, thus increasing the peristaltic movements, and, if lariie' 
amounts are eaten, hastening the food onward bef )re there has 
been sufficient time for the absorption of its contained murients. 

" (3) The cellulose present acts as a local irritant and pro- 
duces the same effect.'^ 

Legumes are apt to produce fermentation, and in this way 
occasion flatulence and gastro-intestinal distress. The digesti- 
bility of the legumes depends largely upon the manner in which 
they are prepared and the amount that is eaten. A large por- 
tion of the legumes ordinarily eaten is imperfectly absorbed by 
the intestine. StriimpelP has shown that about 40 per cent, 
of the contained protein in cooked beans is left unabsorbed, the 
beans being eaten with the skins ; and that with a flour made 
from lentils only 8.2 per cent, of the original amoimt of protein 
is left unabsorbed ; so that wdien eaten simply cooked, a nnieh 
larger proportion remains unabsorbed than when flnely divided 
into a powder. 

Beans form one of the oldest forms of vegetable foods, hav- 
ing been cultivated by the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Kgyp- 
tians. The numerous varieties used for focxl have all l)een im- 
proved by cultural methods. The Windsor })ean, the one which 
was first cultivated, is still growm in p]urope, but does not thrive 
W(A\ in America. The kidney bean, the mo>t important specie-,

was first cultivated, is still grown in Europe, but does not thrive 
well in America. The kidney bean, the most important species, 
is easily cultivated, growing rapidly and seeding early. The 
Lima bean is a great favorite, especially in America. It is a 
short flat bean, somewhat like the kidney in shape. This variety 
is a climber, although bush Limas have been developed by cul- 
tural methods. 

The Soy Bean. — This bean (glycine hispida), sometimes 
called the soja bean, is an annual leguminous plant extensively 
used as a food in China and Japan. Until recently it has been 
regarded as a botanic curiosity in the Occident. It has recently 
been extensively used in America as a forage crop, and to 
improve the soil if ploughed under. Tlie plant is an erect 
annual, bearing pods containing from two to five beans. There 
are a large number of different varieties, which vary in size, 
shape, color, and length of time they take to mature. In the 
East the bean is used in numerous ways. Some are grown 
exclusively for the oil they contain, and it is used for culinary, 
illuminating, and lubricating purposes. The light-colored beans 
are eaten in soups, and the pods are sometimes picked green, 
boiled, and served cold with a sprinkling of soy sauce. The 
green varieties are often pickled in brine and eaten moist or 
dried with meals as appetizers ; the same varieties are often 
slightly sprouted, scalded, and served wdth meals in winter as a 
green vegetable. The bean forms the basis of the so-called soy 
sauces, used as condiments all over the world. The Oriental 
races most frequently eat the bean in more or less cheesy-like 
foods, wdiich are prepared from it. The most common of these 
are natto, tofu, miso, yuba, and shoyu. Natto is a sort of bean 
cheese made by boiling the beans until they become soft and 
then placing the resulting mass in a warm cellar where it fer- 
ments. Tofu is made by soaking the beans in water, crushing 
between millstones, and boiling in about three times their bulk 
of water. The protein is precipitated and the resulting cheese 
eaten. The white milky liquid of the above has nearly the 
composition of cows' milk, and tastes something like malt. It 
may be used in infant feeding to advantage (see same). 

Americans may eat the beans in numerous ways, described 
under the head of soy bean cookery in the recipes at the end 
of this book. The benn is of particular value in diabetes (see 
same). It may be used to increase the ])rotein of the diet. 

There are variations in the conq)osition of the different varie-

The percentage of protein in this florir is almost one-third 
greater than the percentage of protein in the whole beans. This 
is caused bv removino^ the coarse fibrous hulls which contain 
little protein.

cuits. For composition of soy gruels, see Infant Feeding. 

The bean has received attention from time to lime in oth^r 
countries, and suggestion comes in the form of a patent Unnr 
made by a German firm, patented in this country. Thi< is 
made by treating the beans with boiling water and O.o ])er cent, 
of sodium carbonate until the carbohydrates and other water- 
soluble substances are removed. The residue after being dricil 
and pulverized is a yellow ])owder, containing the nutritive fatty 
and protein constituents of the beans. The following articles

very few being grown in Europe. They form a liiirhly nutritious 
food, but the flavor in disagreeable to many jx-rsous, and they 
are said to produce indigestion in some instances. 

The peanut, although ])eculiar in it< growth, is a Icguiiu^ 
as well as the i)ea and bean. It diiVcrs chemically iVom th<' 
other legumes in that it contains a large amount of fat. 

ROOTS AND TUBERS. 

Roots and tubers constitute another class of vegetable f )ods 
that are of great importance. They contain both starch and 
sugar, and to these constituents is due their chief value as a 
food. On account of the small proportion of protein and the 
large amount of water they contain, they are inferior in nutri- 
tive value to both legumes and cereals. 

The potato is, for several reasons, the most imj)ortant 
member of the group. It is a tuber or thickened under- 
ground stem of Solanum tuber-osum. It grows equally well in 
a variety of soils, and when properly cooked is easily digested. 
When cooked in water, the salts pass into the water, but 
when cooked in their skins this loss is largely prevented. By 
baking or roasting the salts are best retained and the potato 
rendered most easily digestible. 

The sweet potato contains more water and sugar but less 
starch than the white potato. When boiled, it usually becomes 
mealy, but is often converted into a stringy, sodden mass that is 
difficult of digestion. 

The yam is a tuber somewhat resembling the ]i(^tato. It is 
grown and eaten chietly in the tropics, but also in some parts 
of Europe. 

The Jerusalem artichoke is commonly used in England. 
It is sweet and watery, contains little starch, is only slightly 
nutritive, but quite easily digestible. 

The beet contains a very large percentage of starch and sugar. 
It is raised extensively for the sugar industry, and is also largely 
employed for making salads to lend variety to the diet. 

Carrots, when young and tender, form a very nutritious 
food, and are greatly relished by many persons. They coutain 
from 85 to 90 per cent, of water. 

Parsnips when boiled long enough form a good food ; like 
carrots, they coutain a large proportion of water and a con- 
siderable amount of sugar. 

Turnips have very slight nutritive value, but are, never- 
theless, very popular as a vegetable. They have a tendency t(^ 
cause flatulence.

GREEN VEGETABLES. 

The green vegetables are valuable not only on account of the 
amount of nutriment present in them, ]>ut for the variety and 
relish they give to the diet. They contain a large amount of 
salts and have valuable antiscorbutic properties. 

Bryant and Milner, in a very careful series of exjieriments,' 
have arrived at the following conclusions concerning the digesti- 
bility of certain vegetables : 

" So far as sources of protein or fat are concerned, the vege- 
tal)les (potatoes, cabbage, and beets) included in these studies 
may ])e considered as of little value. They do, however, con- 
tain carl)ohydrates which are well digested and al)sorbed ; and 
thev mav therefore be considered as of value as sources of 
energy, a large proportion of which ap})ears to be available to 
the body. The chief value of many vegetables, however, is, 
perhaps, aside from the nutriment or energy tliey furnish ; they 
add a ])leasing variety and palatal)ility to the diet, su])ply 
organic acids and mineral salts, and give the f xxl a bulkinos 
that seems to be of importance in its mechanical action in 
maintaining a liealthy activity of the alimentary tract. J\)s- 
sibly the result of these conditions is a favorable influence upon 
the digestion of otlier food eaten with the vegetable." 

Cabbages contain a consi(lcra])le quantity ol' sulphur, and 
on this account are a])t to cause flatulence; where digestion is 
good, however, thev arc.' considered a wholesome form of food.

kraut is considered indigestible. 

Cauliflower is the most digestible member of the cabbage 
family. It may be eaten either as a salad or boiled and serv(;d 
with a milk-sauce. 

Spinach is a po})ular form of veget;ible and is used to a 
great extent. It is valuable chielly for its laxatixc ell'ect. 

I/Cttuce is the most im{)ortant re[)resentativ<' of" a group 
of vegetables usually eaten raw. It is made into salad and 
dressed with vinegar. The various cresses also belong to this 
class. 

Sorrel is eaten chielly in Europe. It has a peculiar acid 
taste, due to acid oxalates, on account of the presenci! of \\lii<'li

Celer}^, which is usually eaten raw, is stringy and has 
scarcely any nutritive value. Cooked in milk it f )rms a ^\ hole- 
some and digestible article of food. 

Tomatoes are eaten both raw and cooked, and are refresh- 
ing, generally liked, and easily digested. They are used t<j 
flavor broths and are valuable for canning pur])oses, inasnuich 
as they retain their flavor better than most vegetal)les. 

The eggplant, a close relative of the tomato, is less diges- 
tible, especially when fried, than the latter. 

Cucumbers are eaten raw, and when young are often 
pickled in vinegar. They are very indigestible. 

Asparagus is highly esteemed f)r its delicate flavor. It 
is easily digested, even by invalids. It has a slightly diuretic 
action, and imparts a most offensive odor to the urine, which 
persists for from twelve to tw^enty-four hours. 

Rhubarb, wdien thoroughly cooked, is quite digestible and 
acts as a laxative. 

Pumpkins are used largely in the making of }ii(^s, etc., but 
they have no special food- value. 

Squash, when young, is quite digestible. 

Onions, garlic, etc., are used both as vegetables and as 
condiments. While onions are used largely f )r llavoring meat- 
stews, salads, and the like, they are also eaten f >r their mildly 
laxative properties.

Vegetarianism. — It will not be out of place here to point 
out the disadvantages of an exclusive vegetable diet. Vege- 
tarians are those who subsist almost entirely upon vegetables, 
cereals, fruits, and nuts ; exceptionally milk and eggs are added 
to their diet-list. 

It is quite possible, by the eating of vegetables alone, to 
supply all the food constituents — carbohydrates, fats, and pro- 
teids — that are required by the body. Proteins are obtained 
partly from vegetables, milk, and eggs ; those derived from 
vegetables, however, are digested with much more difficulty 
and absorbed to a much slighter degree than those derived 
from animal food. Persons suV)sisting on a purely vegetable

FRUITS. 

Fruits are of little value as niitinments, and are useful 
mainly to give variety to the diet. They are used extensively 
as flavoring agents. The chief nutritive constituent of fruits is 
sugar, and they also contain a small amoimt of nitrogenous 
matters, cellulose, starches, organic acids, and a vegetable jelly 
called pectin, which causes fruit to gelatinize when boiled. 
The sugar present in fruit is mainly fruit-sugar, or levulo.-e, 
but some fruits contain, in addition, considerable cane-sugar. 
In general, fruits contain a large amoimt of water, but less 
earthy salts than other foods. The mineral elements of fruit 
consist of potash, united with tartaric, citric, and malic acid. 
To these salts is due the antiscorbutic pro])erty of iVuit. In 
addition to this property fruits also act as diuretics, laxatives, 
and cathartics. The flavor and odor of fruits are due to the 
presence of essential oils and compound ethers. 

The digestibility of fruits varies with the kind of fruit eaten 
and its mode of preparation ; stewed fruits are more easily 
digestible than raw^ fruits. Among the more easily digestible 
fruits are oranges, lemons, grapes, and peaches ; raw ap})les, 
pears, and bananas are somewhat less digestible. 

I/emons, limes, and shaddocks, ])ossessing similar 
properties, are, for descriptive purposes, classed together. 
They are valuable antiscorbutics, and have an acid, ])ungent 
flavor that may be imparted to otherwise tasteless foods. .V 
cooling and refreshing drink may l)e made from lemon-juice 
diluted with water and sweetened with a small quantity of sugar. 

Oranges are used in invalid dietaries, their juice allaying 
thirst very effectively; it can be borne often by even the most 
irritable stomach.

132 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

Apples are wholesome, digestible, and slightly laxative. 
Fresh apples contain approximately 8 per cent, of sugar and 
85 per cent, of water, but in drying two-thirds of the water is 
lost and the sugar is increased to about 45 per cent. 

Pears are, as a rule, more easily digestible than ap})les, 
owing to the fact that their flesh is soft and their skin not so tough. 

Peaches are wholesome and digestible. They contain less 
sugar than most fruits. 

Bananas are the most nutritious of the raw fruits. The 
many varieties differ in digestibility and in flavor. The ordi- 
nary banana, as obtained in the United States, is considered 
indigestible. The flour which is produced from dried bananas 
is very easily digestible. 

Grapes contain a large amount of water and considerable 
sugar, besides salts of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, 
and iron. When thoroughly ri])e they are veiy digestible, and 
form a useful addition to the invalid diet. The habit of swal- 
lowing the skins and seeds of grapes is most pernicious, as 
intestinal irritation is often brought about in this way. 

Raisins are pre})ared l)y drying grapes, the white ones 
1x4 ng those most used. They are indigestible unless well 
C(j()ked ; they are usually added to puddings, sweet breads, etc. 

Plums and green gages are quite digestible when fully 
ripe. They soon overripen, however, and then are as liarmful 
as when unripe. 

Prunes are dried plums. They contain much sugar and 
are markedly laxative in their eflect. 

Olives have a l)ittL'r taste, and are eaten cliiefly as a relish with 
salads. Their nutritive value is due to the oil they contain. 

Strawberries are very wholesome unless taken in excess. 
They are (juite rich in salts of sodium, potassium, and calcium, 
and have mild diui'ctic and laxative ])roperties. 

Currants, gooseberries, raspberries, huckleber- 
ries, mulberries, and a few other berries contain considcTa- 
ble amounts of fi'ce acids. They have slightly laxative prop- 
erties. 

Melons contain over 1)5 per cent, of water and about 5 per 
cent, of other eoiistituents ; they are consi(lere<l indigestible. 

Figs and dates contain large (juantities of sugar. In the 
eastern part of the Knited States tluy are seen only in tlie dried 
form, altliongli in California, whei'e they ai-e I'aised, tliey may 
be obtained iVe.-li. U'he value of the date as a ibod to the 
Arab is well known.

ble can be destroyed by grinding, and thus the nut made more 
easily digestible ; such preparations as Xutrose, Bromose, and Nut- 
meal, of the Sanitos Nut Food Company, are prepared in this way. 

Almonds contain much fat, but no starch and very little sugar, 
and they are, therefore, often utilized as a bread for diabetics. 

Chestnuts contain a small amount of oil and a large 
amount of carbohydrates. They are often eaten raw, and are 
quite indigestible. Properly cooked they are very digestible. 

Walnuts contain a large proportion of protein and fat, but 
are quite indigestible ; in some individuals they produce a 
markedly laxative effect. 

The COCOanut contains a large amount of fat and carbo- 
hydrate, but is exceedingly indigestible.

FUNGI, ALGAE, AND LICHENS. 

Fung^i. — Tlie three varietie.s of i'liiia;! u.-^ually rdUin are tln^ 
mushroom, truffle, and morel. 

Mushrooms are prized chiefly for their a(::r("eahh' tast<'. 
Tliey possess some nutritive vahie, heinii' rich in nitro<j:<'non- 
matter, this material, however, occuirrini:; in such form that it i< 
but slightly absorbed. They arc^ apt to pnxhice j^astro-intestiual 
irritation, and disa,i»rce with many })ersons. 

The truffle grows underground, and is especially souirht for 
on account of its delicate flavor; the black variety is considered 
the finest. 

The morel is tisually obtained from France. It is sold in 
the dried state, and is utilized chiefly for seasoning purposes. 
The following table, by Konig, gives the composition of the 
mushroom, truffle, and morel :

Many fungi are poisonous, and these are ustially distinguished 
by a disagreeable odor and taste, and other j)eculiarities in 
strticture, etc. Gibson, who has made a study of edible fungi, 
considers that the ustial methods of distinguishing l)etween the 
edible and poisonotis varieties are very imreliable. He suggests 
the following as being of especial value : First avoid every nuish- 
room having a cup or stiggestion of such at the base ; the dis- 
tinctly fatal poisons are thtis excluded. Exclude those having 
an unpleasant odor, a peppery, bitter, or other luipalatable llavor, 
and those of tough consistency. In addition, it is well to 
excltide those infested with worms, tho^e in advanced age, or 
partly decayed, and in testing new species they should \)o ke))t 
apart from the others. The best test is to begin with a ])i(('e 
the size of a small pea, chew it very slightly, being careful not 
to swallow any of the saliva, and iinally expel all from the 
mouth. If no results follow during the interval of a day 
the experiment may be repeated, swallowing a little of the julci^, 
the fragments of the fungus being ex])elled as before. In twenty- 
four hours the third trial may be made, swallowing a small frag- 
ment, and if still no unpleasant results follow, the following day 
a piece the size of a hazel nut may be attempted. In tising 



136 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

this method poisonous varieties may be excluded with only 
a temporary indisposition on the part of the experimentalist, and 
is the only safe method of avoiding the poisonous varieties. As 
a rule, any mushroom, omitting the Arnanita, Avhieh is pleasant 
to taste and agreeable as to odor Avhen raw, is ])robably harmless, 
and, if an unfamiliar species, may be tested by the above method. 
(For an excellent description of tlie various fungi the reader is 
referred to Farmers' Bulletin Xo. lo. United States Department 
of Agriculture.) 

Alg"se. — The only one of this group that is utilized as food 
is Irish moss. Its most important constituent is lichenin, a 
mucilage. It is made into a soothing drink for j)atients suffering 
from throat irritation. 

I/ichens. — The only important lichen used as a food is 
Iceland moss. It contains two carbohydrates : (1) lichenin, 
a gelatinous substance ; (2) isolichenin, which resembles starch. 
Iceland moss is utilized as a food in the Arctic regions. It has 
been made into a bread that has been recommended by Senator 
for diabetics. 

SUGARS. 

Sugars are carbohydrates that contain hydrogen and oxygen 
in a proportion to form water. Sugar is one of the most valu- 
able and popular forms of food. This ])0])ularity is due not 
only to its nutritive value, but also to its pleasant taste. Ac- 
cording to Abel,' 86 pounds of sugar per ca])ita were consumed 
in England in 1895 and 64 ])ounds in the United States in the 
same year. From 7,000,000 to 8,000,000 tons are consumed 
annually in the different countries of the world. The principal 
variety of sugar in use is cane-sugar; besides this, gra})e-sugar, 
fruit-sugar, and milk-sugar also enter into the composition of 
our foods. Sugar is obtained in a fluid state, as in honey, as 
well as in crystalline form. 

Suirar is verv fatteninij: and at the same time is also a i^-reat 
source of muscular energy. The negroes working in the sugar 
j)lantations in the West Indies show the eU'ect of eating sugar 
during tlie liarvest season ; they chew the sugar-cane con- 
stantly, in consequence of which their weight and nuiscular 
development increase most remarkably. Sugars and starch are 
said to be identical in nutritive vahic, owing to the iact that 
both must be converted into dextro.-e Ix'ibi'o they can be ab- 
sorbed. Most of the ill effects attriluited to the use of sugar 
are (hie to the iact that more than one-(|uarter of a pound is 
consiuned dail\' (Hutchison); this amount mav be taken with

Sugar can be absorbed only as dextrose and as levulose. all 
varieties of sugar being converted into these ioi-ms befoi-e ihev 
are absorbed. In strong solution sugar irritates tlu; nuieous 
membrane of the stomach, and is a])t to undergo fei-mentation 
and thus produce gastro-intestinal distress. Robertson \ui\es 
the following table, arranged according to the rapidlt^y with 
which sugars are apt to ferment : 

Lactic. Butyric. Alcoholic.

Cane-sugar is the most common and most extensively used 
form of sugar. It is made chiefly from sugar-cane and from 
the sugar-beet. When pure, it consists of a mass of wliite 
crystals. It is soluble in one-half its weight of cold water and 
in even less of hot water. In order to obtain the sugar from 
the cane the canes are crushed and the fluid ()l)tained treated 
with sulphurous acid, neutralized witli lime, and boiled; it is 
then Altered and evaporated, when the sugar crystallizes out. 
The sugar is still further refined by remelting and filtering 
through charcoal. 

Caramel is made by heating refined cane-sugar to 400^ F., 
when it is melted and browned. Tlie resulting brown sub- 
stance is called caramel. It has a bitter taste, and is often 
used as a flavoring agent, especially for invalid foods. 

Candy contains a large amount of sugar, besides l)utter and 
other fats, starch, nuts, flavoring exti-acts, etc. The chief 
varieties of candy are made up largely of glucose and starch, 
colored with anilin dyes. Thompson says : '' children assimilate 
candy better than adults because they are less lial)le to dys- 
pepsia, and because of their relatively active muscular energy 

^Edinburgh Med. Jour., March, 1894. 



138 CLASSES OF FOODS, 

and relatively large body surface for losing heat, in proportion 
to their size. They do not, as a rule, care for fat meat, and 
prefer sweets as a natural substitute.^' Contrary to popular 
belief, there is no evidence to show that candy produces any 
injurious effect on the teeth. 

Molasses, Treacle, and Syrup. — Molasses and treacle 
are by-products formed in the manufacture of cane-sugar. 
Molasses forms a highly nutritious food. On account of the 
impurities it contains molasses has a more pronounced aperient 
effect than refined syrup. Besides cane-sugar and certain acids, 
etc., molasses contains about 30 per cent, of invert-sugar and 
the same amount of water. 

Hutchison (p. 264) gives the following table showing the 
composition of molasses, treacle, and syrup : 

Molasses. Treacle. Syrup.

Glucose, or grape-sugar, is chiefly made from starch by 
inversion or hydrolysis. It is not nearly so sweet as cane- 
sugar, and crystallizes with difficulty. It is present in small 
quantities, in combination with other varieties of sugar, in 
most fruits. When taken in excess, glucose appears in the 
urine unchanged. 

I/actose, or sugar of milk, is the natural carbohydrate 
for the young, growing infant. It is less abundant in cows' 
milk than in human milk, and for this reason it should be 
added to the milk of bottle-fed infants. 

Honey is sugar in a concentrated solution. It is made by 
bees from the nectar gathered from various flowers. It contains 
a crytallizable sugar, resembling glucose, and a non-crystal- 
lizable form. HcMiey was formerly used as a sweetening agent, 
but cane-sugar, on account of its cheapness and abundance, has 
largely superseded it. Besides sugar, honey contains wax, gum, 
and coloring substances. 

Saccharin is used largely as a substitute for sugar in cases 
of rheumatism and diabetes. After long-continued use of large 
quantities of saccharin digestive disturbances are apt to be pro- 
duced. 

lyevulose, or fruit-sugar, is also utilized as a form of 
sugar in certain cases of diabetes.

SPICES AND CONDIMENTS. 

Spices and condirnents play an important role in inorcnsinL'" 
the appetite and aidin<^ tlie di^-estive i'lUK'tions ; they hav(; prac- 
tically no nutritive value. By the action of tliese substances 
on the organ of taste as well as on the mucous membrane oi' 
the stomach the appetite is stinudated and the secretion of 
gastric juice increased. In certain gastric disturbances, as well 
as in diseases of the kidneys, they act as irritants and >li()ul(V 
be avoided. Some spices act as food })reservaiives. 

The peppers are among the fovorite spices ; tliere arc two 
varieties, the white and the black. 

Mustard. — Mustard is used chiefly in salads or with (itiicr 
foods, and has a marked tendency to increase the appetite. 
There are two forms of mustard: that which is obtained from 
the black mustard plant and that derived from the white 
mustard plant. In kirge quantities and diluted with water 
mustard acts as an irritant to the stomach, producing nausea 
and vomiting. 

Vinegar is produced from various alcoholic drinks and from 
fruits. It contains 5 per cent, of acetic acid. By its action 
on the cellulose of vegetables vinegar softens the fiber, so that 
it not only acts as a condiment, but also assists in the digestion 
of the cellulose; for this purpose it is added to such vegetables 
as cabbage, lettuce, and cucumbers. 

Horseradish is a condiment that is much used with varic^us 
foods; it stimulates the flow of saliva as well as of the gastric 
secretion. 

Sauces, such as tomato, catsuj), AVorcestershire, and the 
like, increase the appetite and give a relish to certain foods. 

Spices act merely by adding a flavor to foods, in this way 
increasing the appetite for food that would otherwise l)e insipid. 
Those most in use are ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. 

FATS AND OILS. 

One-fifth of the body-weight consists of i'at. This is ob- 
tained in part from fatty food and in jiart from the carbo- 
hydrates and the proteins. Most of the heat energy furni>he<l 
the body is supplied by fat ; it oxidizes very rapidly, and in 
this way spares the protein elements that would otherwise be 
required to furnish energy. Fats are digestal in the intestine, 
where they are emulsified previous to being absorbed. The 
most useful forms of fat are cream and butter; other forms two 



140 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

bacon and cod-liver oil. When eaten too liberallv, fats are apt 
to cause indigestion, and when this exists, they should be taken 
only in very restricted quantities. 

Foods fried in fat are indigestible, and hot fats are more 
indigestible than cold. Fats and oils have a tendency to relieve 
constipation, but are counterindicated in diarrhea. 

The most important animal fats are butter, cream, lard, suet, 
oleomargarin, cottolene, butterine, cod-liver oil, and bone-mar- 
row. Of the vegetable fats, those most commonly em]:)loved 
are olive oil, cotton-seed oil, linseed oil, cacao-butter, and the 
oils obtained from nuts, such as cocoanut oil, peanut oil, and 
almond oil. 

Indications for the Use of Fatty Foods. — Fatty 
foods are indicated especially in wasting disorders and in con- 
valescence from certain acute diseases. They are needed par- 
ticularly in tuberculosis, rachitis, chronic bronchitis, and chronic 
diseases accompanied by the formation of abscesses. 

There are many pro])rietary fatty foods on the market, some 
of which are worthy of mention. In most of these the fats, 
usually cod-liver oil, have been emulsified ; this emulsiiication 
aims to make the oil less objectionable to the taste and also to 
render it more easily digestible. 

The Use of Olive Oil in the Treatment of Certain 
Diseases. — The external and subcutaneous use of olive oil 
will be discussed further on (p. 363). ChauflPord and Dupre 
were the first to advocate the use of olive oil in the treatment 
of cJtolc'Iit/ddsis. They recommended that two doses of 400 
grams each be given at half-hour intervals, the })atient being 
directed to lie for three hours on his right side. The use of 
olive oil in the treatment (»f this condition lias subsequently 
been advocated l)y Walker, A'ett.-teiner, and others. 

Kosenheim has advised the use of olive oil in the treatment 
of dricture of flic ('.'<o])Iu(f/vy due to carcinoma. After allowing 
a small quantity of oil to flow into the esophagus, ])atients who 
were unable to swallow before have frequently been enabled to 
swallow fluids and semisolids. 

lve(;ently Cohnheim ^ has advocated the use of large cpianti- 
ties of olive oil in the treatment ol' certain forms of (/(istric 
(Jiyoi-dcr. In cases of gastric dilatation he usually administers 
the oil once dailv, in the nioi'uing before l)reakfast, in doses of 
from TOO to ]~)()('.c.; in those instances in which lavage is 
practis<'d tlie oil is given imnuKliately ai'ter thi> ])rocedure. 
After taking the oil the patient is re(pn"red to lie on his right

Cobnlieim orders that a wineii'lassful he taken one hour Ixl'mr 
breakfast and two dessertspoonfuls from oiu' lo \\\n hoinv- 
before dinner and before supper. In simple foi-m.-- <»!' nice!' 
lie recommends that the olive oil be used only in the nmi-ninL:, 
and the emulsion of sweet almonds (see below ) at ikm'H and 
nioht ; most patients do not object to the ta>te ol' the oil. 
According to Cohnheim, in those instances in which the ta-tc 
of the oil is objected to, this may be overcome by taking a 
pinch of salt, a swallow of brandy, or by allowing a pepper- 
mint drop to dissolve in the mouth. The oil treatment nni.-L 
be continued over a period of weeks or montiis. C'ohnheim's 
conclusions are as follows : 

^^1. Cases of dilatation of tbe stomacli due to s])asm cau.-ed 
by an nicer or iissure at the jndorus are cured or at least markedly 
relic^'cd by the use of large quantities of oil (100 to 1 oO grams). 

"2. Cases of stenosis of the jiylorus due to organic disease 
with secondary dilatation are also usually relatively cured l)y 
the use of large quantities of oil ; that is, th.ese patients are 
freed from disturbances while leading an abstemious lite. In 
these cases the oil acts mechanically by relieving friction. 

" 3. Cases of relative stenosis of the ])ylorus and duodenum 
which are clinically marked by a continuous hyperseci-etion 
and pyloros})asm several hours after the ])rincipal meals, are 
much improved or cured by the oil treatment. 

"4. The pylorospasm found in cases of carcinoma of the 
pylorus is much diminished or relievx'd by the oil treatment. 

" o. Cases of ulcer of the pylorus associated with or without 
hyperchlorhydria are quickly cured by means of the oil treat- 
ment or by an emulsion of sweet almonds. 

" (). The oil is l)est taken three times daily, half to one hoju' 
bef)re meals; as a rule, it is best to adminisl(M' a win(>g]as-fnl 
early in the morning and two desserts})oonfuls before dinner and 
sup])er. In mild cases an emidsion of sweet almonds may be 
substituted f )r it. 

'^ 7. The oil fulfils three indications : it (n'crcomes ])yloro- 
spasm ; it relieves friction, and tends to improve tiie general 
nutrition. 

"8. The oil acts as a narcotic in cases of pyloro<pa-m, pro- 



142 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

ducing, however, no unfavorable eiFect — neither eructations nor 
diarrhea. 

" 9. No favorable effect of the oil treatment has been found 
in purely hysteric gastric colics. 

" 10. In that form of gastric neurosis manifested by pain 
when the stomach is empty very favorable symptomatic relief 
has been obtained from the use of olive oil. 

'^11. A certain number of cases of stenosis of the pylorus 
accompanied by a consequent gastrectasia can often be so much 
relieved by the oil treatment that no operative procedure need 
be undertaken. A trial should be made of the oil treatment 
in all cases of stenosis of the pylorus before advising operative 
procedure. 

" 12. The treatment prevents prophylactically the produc- 
tion of gastrectasia and prevents relapses when utilized in 
favorable cases.' ^ 

Olive Oil in the Treatment of Chronic Dysentery. — Ruth- 
erford ^ gives his results with olive oil in the treatment of chronic 
dysentery. According to him, " Upon the internal administra- 
tion of olive oil typical cases of chronic dysentery practically 
without exception show changes in their condition as follows : 
" 1. Positive evidence of increased quantities of bile in the 
feces. 

" 2. Decrease in the number of daily bowel movements and 
marked improvement in the character of the same. 

" 3. Gradual cessation of signs of fermentation and putre- 
faction along the intestinal tract and consequent subsidence of 
pain and tenderness. 

" 4. General systemic improvement ; gain in a])petite ; repair 
of digestive fltculties ; symptoms of improved nervous system ; 
and rapid gain in weight and strengtli. 

'' o. Ap])areiit positive cure after an average time of two 
months and upward, witli few recurrences." 

The metliod of carrying out the treatment is as follows : 
" First Period. — The patient is given one ounce (30 c.c.) of 
olive oil tln^ee times a day for the first tln^e days, wlien the 
quantity is increased to two ounces (60 c.c.) three times daily, 
and on the sixth day the same quantity is given four times a 
day. During the first three days the patient is to be kejit on 
a milk diet. During tlie latter half one to three ounces (30- 
90 c.c.) of scraped beef or its equivalent of egg-albumin will 
be added daily. During this trciitment a slight loss in weight 
may be temporarily noticed. 

^ Amrrican Medicine, March 1904. 



FATS AND OILS. 143 

" Second Period. — During this period tlic amount of oil is 
given in greater quantities (not less than three ounee.^ — IM) cc. 
— three times a day without discomfort to the patient), and 
must be kept up for a length of time in severe and chronic 
cases; perhaps for two months or longer, during wliicli period con- 
valescence will have been estal)lished and the weight regained. 

" Third Period. — During this period tin* patient is gi-aduallv 
restored to a full diet, and the oil decreased in anioinit nntil tli<' 
ulcers have permanently healed and a recurrence not j)rol>able." 

Blum first advocated the use of olive oil by rectal injection 
for the treatment of r/(///-6'/'on(^ co(ir,and claims good rc.-uh- i'miw 
its use. Fleiner first recommended the use of copious oil in- 
jections — 400 to 500 c.c. — in the treatment of certain foians 
of chronic constipation. Kemarkable results are produced in 
the spastic forms of cln-onic constipation when this (juantitv ot' 
oil is injected two or three times weekly. The oil should l»e 
heated to the body-temperature, and injected high at bedtime 
and retained during the night; the same precautions shoidd be 
observed as in giving nutrient enemata. (See p. 355.) 

The Use of Emulsion of Sweet-almond Oil in the 
Treatment of Certain Gastric Disorders. — Colmheim^ 
recommends an emulsion of almonds in those cases in which 
olive oil is not well borne. In effect it is identical to olive oil, 
previously described, relieving spasm and irritation ; on the 
other hand, it lacks the nutritive value of olive oil. On ac- 
count of its more pleasant flavor it is preferred by some. 
Cohnheim gives the following directions for pre})aring an enud- 
sion of almond oil : A dessertspoonful of sweet almonds are 
blanched by scalding with hot water and removing the skins, 
after being allowed to dry they are groiuid into a ])o\vder and 
placed into a cup of boiling water; this mixture is next rubbed 
by means of a spoon, and strained through a j)iece of gauze ; a 
quantity equal to from 200 to 250 grams should be obtaiu(Hl 
from a dessertspoonful of almonds. The enudsion should be 
taken warmed and sweetened one-half hour bef)re meals, in 
order to relieve any irritation at the pylorus and to prevent 
spasm in this portion of the stomach. 

The various fats still to be mentioned are butterine, oleomar- 
garin and bone-marrow. 

Butterine is a fat prepared from beef and hog's fat, and is 
frequently used in this country instead of btitter ; oleomar- 
garin is a similar preparation made from beef fat. Both biit-

144 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

teriiie and oleomargarin are wholesome fatty foods, the only 
objection against them being that they are often sold fraud- 
ulently for butter. 

Bone-tnarrow is a fat obtained from the large bones of the 
ox. It is used in the treatment of tuberculosis and in the 
various forms of anemia, especially in pernicious anemia. Tlie 
marrow of young animals is usually preferred. A ])reparation 
known as the glycerin extract of bone-marrow is often utilized. 

SALTS. 

The principal mineral constituents of the body are the chlorids, 
phosphates, sulphates, carbonates, fluorids, and silicates of 
potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and iron. lodin is ])res- 
ent especially in the thyroid gland, and the other halogens are 
also found in the l)ody. The amount of heat and energy sup- 
plied by salt metabolism is so small as to be practically disre- 
garded, but the salts play a most important part in the metabolic 
processes and also maintain osmotic pressure. They are also 
essential to nervous and muscular reaction. 

The following table shows the salt content of some of the 
tissues of the body : 

The mineral salts taken in the body in the food are excreted 
in the feces, the urine, sweat, and also in the exfoliation of 
epidermis, the hair, and the nails. The average amounts of 
the various compounds excreted is shown in the following table :

Ash analyses may be misleading as far as phosphoric and 
sulphuric acid are concerned, as they may be artificial products 
from nuclein-containing substances. It will be seen that animal 
food contains relatively few bases, whilst vegetables contain 
large quantities of the alkaline bases and also phosphoric acid. 
The alkaline bases are, however, always in excess. 

The metabolism of the salts in the body plays a very im- 
portant part in the physiology of nutrition, and disturbances of 
this salt metabolism may be the cause of disease. This subject 
is as yet but little understood, but the therapy of the future will 
undoubtedly depend upon the practical application of the prin- 
ciples of nutrition. If the salts are withdrawn entirely death 
results, and F(n'ster and others have shown that dogs led u[)on 
foods from which the salts had been extracted by water die in 
from 26 to .'36 days. If salts are given in excess they are ex- 
creted, but if greatly in excess, may be retained in the b(^dy 
and cause untoward symptoms. Under certain conditions even 
small amounts may be retained or, on the other hand, sidts may 
be excreted in such (piantity in t!ie urine that they cannot be 
held in suspension, and art' con-ccpiently deposited in the urinary 
tract and cause stone. 

Animal food contsuns sulphur and phosphorus compounds, 
which by oxidation in the l)ody are changed into sul])huric and 
])h()S])hoi'ie acids, which tend to render the ])lood and tissues 
acid. I he destructive metaboh'sm of the tissues of th(^ bodv 
tends toward the same end. The veL!:etal)le foods, the cei'eals 
excepted, contain large amounts of alkaline ])ases, which tend 
to neutralize the acids and to render the tissues alkaline. A

The potassium salts are thought to be a factor in exciting the 
action of the oxidizing ferments, but this functi(tn is not at- 
tributed to the sodium salts. The potassium sall> f<»rm carbon-

ates, and these meeting the sodium chlorid in the blood and 
tissues, a partial exchange takes place with the formation of 
potassium chlorid and sodium carbonate. The potassium salt 
is excreted in the urine, whilst the sodium is set free by the 
action of the hydrochloric acid, which saturates the peptones, 
or unites with the sulpliuric or phosphoric acid, forming sul- 
phates or phosphates, which are excreted in the uriue. Part 
of the potassium salts goes to form organic compounds. A cer- 
tain amount of sodium chlorid is constantly present in the blood, 
and this aids in the excretion of tlie products of metabolism. 
Increasing the salts causes an increase in the amount of urine 
passed, and this is merely the means of maintaining the normal 
balance of the salts. Increasing the amount of salt taken causes 
great thirst, and may be the cause of the ingestion of large quan- 
tities of water. The effect of hyperchloridation and hypochlorida- 
tives in various nervous diseases has been studied by Vincent, 
Claude, and others. In healthy individuals the complete with- 
drawal of salt is followed by the appearance of certain symptoms, 
chief of which are lassitude, an incapacity for work, dyspepsia, and 
cramps. These symptoms are promptly relieved by restoring 
the usual allowance of salt. On the other hand, a salt-free 
diet or a lowered salt allowance seems to have a beneficial effect 
in some nervous diseases, as in epilepsy, in which disease it in- 
creases the action of the bromids. It has been suggested that 
a salt-free diet be tried in hysteria and some of the other func- 
tional nervous troubles, as an addition of 12 to 15 grams of 
salt to the diet in hysteria aggravates the condition very much, 
and in latent hysteria may make it manifest. The effect of a 
salt-free diet in edema is noted in the section on Nephritis. 
Animals which feed exclusively upon meat do not need salt, a 
fact pointed out by Bunge. The acids formed in metabolism in 
these animals is neutralized by bases formed by the breaking 
down of protein. Potassium salts being present in vegetables 
causes an excess of potassium in the blood. In order to elimi- 
nate this, as explained above, a large amount of sodium chlorid 
is necessary. All graminivorous animals need salt, and the same 
is true of man, who is omnivorous. The average individual 
takes more than there is any necessity f )r, however, the taste 
for this flavor leadino^ to excesses. An average amount for an 
adult is from 20 to •'>() grams a day. 

The Halogens. — fhe elements chlorin, iodin, bromin, 
and fluorin are taken into the body in food or drink. The 
most important, chlorin, is taken principally as sodium chlorid.

Bromin Is found In the nnclcar proteins and is excreted 
in the sweat. Foods which contain lodin also have bromin in 
them, although not In the same quantities. Fluorin is present 
in the body and Is taken In with the drinking-water. 

Sulphur. — Sulphur Is contained In both animal and vege- 
table proteins. Four-fifths of the snlphur taken is oxidized 
and excreted in the urine either as sulphates or ])henol sulphates, 
the remainder enters into compounds of more com])lex compo- 
sition. About 1 gram of sulphur is excreted daily by an 
adult. 

Phosphorus. — This element is found In the body in hirge 
quantities. Volt has estimated that a man weigliiiig 70 kilos 
(154 pounds) contained 1400 grams in the bones, b")0 grams 
In the muscles, and 12 grams In the brain and nerves. It also 
occurs In the body-fluids. In foods it is found in the form of 
the inorganic phos])hates ; in the form of simple organic deriv- 
atives of phosphoric acid and phosphates (phytin), etc. ; in the 
form of phosphorlzed proteins, as micleo-albumin, etc. The 
body Is able to build up complex phosphorus compounds from

that contained in the calcium phosphate and the other com- 
ponents of the body. Some studies have been made of phos- 
phorus metabolism, particularly phosphorus equilibrium.^ Ap- 
parently phosphorus equilibrium may be maintained on various 
amounts of phosphorus, depending on the amounts habitually 
ingested, and in this it resembles nitrogen. Sherman and 
others have determined that if the phosphorus is taken in the 
foods in the form of the organic compounds, that equilibrium 
may be maintained in 0.9 grams of phosphorus or about 2 
grams of P2O-. On a full diet more is required, and they esti- 
mate from 1.5 grams of phosphorus daily or 3.5 grams of PgOj. 
The Danilevskys have shown that lecithin exerts a favorable 
influence on the metabolism of growing animals. 

The yolk of eg^^ is the most available and perhaps best form 
in which to increase the phosphorus content of the food. 

The table which follows gives the data regarding the calcium, 
magnesium, and phosphorus content of food materials.

152 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

Iron. — The human body of average size (65 kilos) is sup- 
posed to contain from 3 to 35 grams of iron, chiefly in the 
hemoglobin of the blood and in the chromatin substance in the 
nuclei. The amount of iron excreted daily as waste is very 
small ; in fasting 0.007 to 0.008 grams, and in restricted diets 
to 0.0055 to 0.0125 grams. The iron in the food is absorbed 
from the small intestine, and is distributed chiefly to the liver, 
spleen, and bone-marrow. After being utilized the waste iron 
is excreted through the walls of the intestine, and a very little 
by the kidneys and in the bile. The iron used in the body is 
probably all derived from the food, although inorganic iron 
undoubtedly is absorbed and is deposited and excreted much 
the same as the iron in the food. The more recent authorities 
believe that the chief use of inorganic iron so often adminis- 
tered is to stimulate the blood-making organs. There can be 
no question, however, about the advisability of administering 
iron. 

Approximate estimates made by Sherman of 20 American 
dietaries showed a minimum of 7 milligrams per man per day 
in a negro family in Alabama to 35 milligrams in Maine lum- 
bermen. 

The iron in the diet ordinarily used corresponds nearly to 
the amount of protein used. The variations of the iron in an 
ordinary diet containing 100 grams of protein varies from 15 
to 20 milligrams. 

Animals fed on diets poor in iron become anemic. Young 
animals thrive on milk which is poor in iron, but this is 
explained by Bunge, who has shown that the bodies of animals 
which live upon milk contain at birth a large amount of iron 
which is sufficient to tide them over until they take food richer 
in iron. Woman's and cows' milk contain approximately the 
same amounts of iron, but infants fed on dilutions of cows' 
milk may become anemic, owing to the very small amount of 
iron taken. 

The amounts of iron in various foods are shown in the fol- 
lowing table from Bulletin 185, Experiment Station, United 
States Department of Agriculture :

Manganese. — This metal is found in the body in minute 
quantities, and small amounts are found in some food material.-. 
The ash of legumes, asparagus, cauliflower, lettuce, i:raj)e.<, and 
of various grains contains varying amounts of manganese. 



154 CLASSES OF FOODS. 

Silica. — This element is eliminated in the hair and desqua- 
mated epithelium. It is present in many vegetables, but the 
part played in the animal economy is unknown. 

Arsenic. — Gautier has demonstrated the presence of a trace 
of arsenic in the ectodermic tissues, the skin, hair, brain, mam- 
mary gland, and thyroid. Smaller traces have been demonstra- 
ted in other organs. The role of arsenic in metabolism is un- 
known. Traces of arsenic have been found in certain vege- 
tables, as cabbage and turnips, as well as in some cereals. 
Common salt may contain some arsenic, and it is sometimes 
present in foods either as an adulterant or as a food poison. 
(See same.) 

Calcium Metabolism. — Calcium is taken into the body in 
organic forms, as in milk, yolk of egg, and cereals, and as in- 
organic salts chiefly in drinking water, as carbonates, sulphates, 
and phosphates. Both forms are absorbable, but this depends 
largely on what salts are taken with it. Sodium chlorid, for 
example, increases the absorption, while the presence of alkalis 
decreases it. The minimum amount of lime by which a calcium 
equilibrium may be maintained is stated at from 1 to IJ grams 
per day as a standard for the average sized adult. There seem, 
however, to l)e great variations in the quantities by which a cal- 
cium equilibrium may be established; 5 to 10 per cent, of that 
taken is excreted in the urine, while the remainder is found 
in the feces, whether unabsorbed or absorbed, and then elimi- 
nated in the intestine. The calcium excretion in the urine may 
1)0 increased by increase in the ingestion of water, by the 
administration of dilute hydrochloric acid, and very largely 
increased by the administration of lactic acid and sodium 
lactate. It is also increased in bodily rest. There is a loss 
of lime over that taken into the l)ody in osteomalacia, in per- 
nicious anemia, in advanced tuberculosis and in diabetes, and 
there is a deficient excretion, and the lime is retained in the body 
in arteriosclerosis. If the diet given is deficient in calcium, 
tlu! loss will exceed the intake. If the diet contains excessive 
amr)unts of calcium, some of the linu} will l)e retained in the body, 
is ap))arently stored up in the l)on('<, and may not produce any 
synq)toms. Foods })articul;n']y low in calcium content are 
white bread, grapes, hiittcr, chicken, and roast beef. In the 
artic](M)n Oxaluria will be found lists of various foods with the 
calcium content given. 

Calcium Metabolism and Tetany. — Stoelzner has called at- 
tention to the fact that frank oi' latent tetany can l)e influenced 
by diet, and that the adm.inistration of cows' milk causes a

SALT METABOLISM AND DISEASE. 

The tissues differ in their salt composition, and changes in 
salt metabolism are probably due either to atrophy or growth of 
certain organs or tissues, or to their taking on new functions, or 
to the processes of disease. Studies of the balances of the var- 
ious salts, have been made but sparingly in disease, and doubt- 
less this subject will be taken up more energetically in the future. 
In hunger, Wellman found that there was a greater loss of salt 
than could be accounted for by the metabolism of the thshv 
parts. The principal excess was phosphoric pentoxid and cal- 
cium and magnesium oxid in about the same proportion as are 
found in bone, and the skeletons of the animals were found to 
have actually lost G or 7 per cent, of their weight. There Is 
a low^ered calcium excretion in many diseased conditions, among 
which may be mentioned, pleural etfuslon, pneumonia, delirium 
tremens, and various fevers. In pulmonary tuberculosis Senator 
found that there was an excess of calcium excreted. In o>teo- 
malacia the calcium balance is dlstin-bed, and more Is excreted 
than is taken into the body. Phosphoric acid lessens the cal- 
cium excreted, and this might be used in exjierimental thera- 
peutics. Castration, which has been done In a few eases, i"es- 
tores the CaO., equlllbriinn, and there is also a tendeney to 
restoration of the sulphiu' equilibrium. On the other hand, in 
myositis ossificans the amount of calcium excreted In the urine 
is lower than normal. There Is also a retention of lime salts in 
arthritis deformans. In endarteritis the ealeium (excretion is 
interferred with, and Rumpf claims to liave obtained good re- 
sults by giving salts which aid the excretion of calcium a- lac- 
tic acid, sodium lactate, sodium citrate, sodium carbonate, and 
sodium chlorld.

BEVERAGES AND STIMULANTS. 

WATER. 

Water is the chief constituent of all beverages, and also 
enters largely into the composition of solid food. The human 
body itself is composed of about 60 per cent, of water. While 
man can live for weeks without food, he can abstain from water 
for but a few days. Water is absolutely necessary as a solvent, 
and as it is constantly being eliminated by the skin, lungs, and 
kidneys, this loss must be replaced by some means in order to 
maintain the functions of the body. This is most conveniently 
done through the agency of the various beverages. The best 
method, however, of replenisliing the water-supply is that of 
drinking the \vater in its pure state, when it retains all its sol- 
vent properties. Some waters are taken for their laxative or 
purgative action, and others for the salts which they contain. 

The amount of water consumed daily by the average person 
is from six to eight glasses. This varies, however, witli the 
amount and variety of food and exercise taken. The age, sex, 
and size of the individual and the season of the year also in- 
fluence the total daily consumption of water. In very warm 
weather, for exam]^le, and nnder severe physical strain, much 
water that would not ])e lost in the cold season of the year is 
eliminated in tlie f 'rm of perspiration and must be compen- 
sated for. 

Water is absorbed chiefly in tlie intestine ; a small amount is 
absorbed in the stomacli, and but a very trilling amount, if 
any, in tlie moutli. The water absorbed in tlie intestine is 
pa-sed into lympliatics, and carried on into the circulation, 
whence it is eliminated. Thus l)y removing the water from 
the blood and sending it through the kidneys into the bladder, 
s])ace is made in the circulation f >r the entrance of more fhiid 
from the alimentary tract. 

As previously stated, wator is eliminated tlirough tlic skin, 
kidneys, lungs, and feces. The amount of water excreted dally 
varies greatly under sjK'cial condition^. Tn cold weather the 
skin is inactive and tlie kidneys excrete a greater amount 
of water than in hot weather, when tlie sweat-glands fuuc- 

L5S 



tionate more actively. When tliei-e is a tciidcnrv towani 
liquid movements from the l)owel, the cliniinaiion hv the kid- 
neys is lessened. In warm weather eliniinalioi! l.v ihc hhii:^ 
is stimulated. 

The temperature of driukinix-waler is a nuiitcr (•!" -onic im- 
portance. Iced water will stimulate a nidi-c rapid and a -i-'-atc r 
secretion of o-astric juice, hut lessens the m<)tilii\- ot' ilic Momaeli. 
Iced water in excess is injiu-ious, and should not l.c taken wh.-n 
one is overheated. Hot water has a verv heiielleial cIIm'! on an 
irritated stomach. 

Water is a most valuable diuretic and diaphoi'eiie. When 
the stomach can not retain it, it is often liiven l.\ the ice- 
tiun. A pint of salt solution, if injected hv the n-e ef a rectal 
tube, will, if the colon has ])reviously been emptie(l, be f( taiiied 
long enough to be absorbed. W a half-pint or even a pint of 
salt solution be introduced under the skin, it v>ill be al)M)rbed 
rapidly and as rapidly be eliminated. This is (jne of the nio^t 
useful measures for producing rapid elimination throiiirh the 
kidneys. 

According to the amotnit of mineral water thev cntain 
waters are classed as hard and soft. Kain-water i- >ol"t, and i< 
the ])urest form of natural water. The hardne^s of wat<r is 
due to earthy carbonates; by boiling, the carbonic acid ga- is 
driven oif and the carbonates are preciT)itateil, and the water 
thus rer.dered more suitable as a beverage. JJoilino- has the 
additional advantage that it destroys most oC the miero-oriian- 
isms that may be present in the Avater. 

Water often contains im])urities, such a- lime, magne-ia, iron, 
and other salts, or micro-organisms, and it often becomes nece-- 
sary to purify it for drinking ])ur])oses. Txplioid tever and 
cholera are communicated chieiiy through the :igency of polliite.l 
drinking-water. The best method of puriiieation is by di>til!:;- 
tion, by which means both inorganic and organic impnriti(< 
can be removed or rendered innocuous. Thi< method i-- now- 
used largely on ships. A\dien distilled ajid af^rated, .-ea-watt i' 
makes a most pleasant beverage. Water may al.-o be pnritied 
by means of filtration, charcoal and san.d bi'inu' used exten-ivel\- 
for this purpose. Porcelain cvlinders are abo in common u-e. 
Whatever the filtering agent emploved, nnle<- it be k( pt clean 
it is liable to become a sotu'ce of ccmtamination rather than of 
purification. Owing to the fact that soluble Impuritie- often 
pass through the filter, filtered water is not nearly so reliable a- 
distilled water. A very economic and convenient method of 



160 BEVERAGES AND STIMULANTS. 

purifying water is to dissolve one gram of alum in a little water 
and pour this solution into one gallon of the water to be puri- 
fied. After standing for twenty-four hours the impurities will 
be precipitated. 

MINERAL WATERS. 

Mineral waters are frequently taken as substitutes for ordi- 
nary water ; at times they produce a most marked stimulating 
eifect on various organs. Their efficiency is greatly enhanced 
when a " drinking cure '^ is combined with proper dietetic regu- 
lations. Mineral waters differ from ordinary waters in the 
greater amount of gaseous and solid matters they contain. The 
gaseous constituents of mineral waters are mainly carbon dioxid 
and sulphuretted hydrogen. The solid constituents are salts of 
sodium, potassium, magnesium, aluminum and calcium, iron, 
iodin, bromin, chlorin, and sulphur. Taken before meals, 
waters containing carbonic acid have a soothing effect on an 
irritated stomach. Taken in excess, all carbonated waters are 
apt to produce indigestion. 

Some waters have a purgative effect, others a laxative, and 
still others diuretic. Thermal waters issue hot from springs, 
their virtue being due to their heat. Some mineral waters have 
no medicinal virtue whatever, and are utilized merely as drink- 
ing-water. 

Classification of Mineral Waters. — The following 
classification and description of mineral waters are taken from 
Cohen's Physiologic Tkerapeiitics, vol. ix., p. 416 (Kisch, Hins-

saline-acidulous waters. The simple acidulous wat<'rs are those 
that contain large amounts of carlxm dioxid ; tliis in^n-cdicut 
increases the peristaltic; action of the stomach and intcstiiic 
These waters are utilized lartrely in the treatment ol" minor pis- 
trie disturbances and in catan-hal conditions of the respij-atoiT 
tract. Among the most important oi" these watei-s ai'e : Apol- 
linaris water; the l)or()theen(|U(>lle, at ( ai-lshad ; the (iev>er

Alkaline Muriated AciduJo}(s Waters. — These waters contain, 
in addition to sodium carbonate and ctirbon dioxid, hir^c (pian- 
tities of sodium chlorid. They exert a nuu'kedly solvent ell'ect 
on uric acid, and liquefy the secretions from the i-esj)ii-atoi-y 
tract. They are especially useful in catarrhal conditions of the 
respiratory tract, such as chronic bronchitis, and in chronic 
catarrh of the stomach, of the biliary ])as.^ages, and of' the 
urinary organs. They are used for gargling and inhalation 
purposes, and also for baths. To this class belong the waters 
of Royat, Ems, Selters, and Saratoga A'ichy.

Alkaline Saline Acidulous Waters. — These waters contain sul- 
phate in addition to bicarbonate and clilorid of sodium. They 
occur as both warm and cold waters. The cold waters possess 
a markedly diuretic effect, and when taken in large quantities 
act as purgatives. The warm waters diminish the urinary 
secretion. The cold alkaline saline waters are useful in strong 
individuals for reducing flesh and for the relief of constipation. 
The warm waters are useful in gastro-intestinal catarrh, ulcer 
of the stomach, gout, catarrhal jaundice, congestion of the 
liver, cholelithiasis, and in conditions associated with urinary 
concretions. Among this class of waters are to be mentioned 
Carlsbad, Marienbad, Elster, Keyser Spa in California, Castle 
Creek, Hot Springs in Arizona, Idaho Hot Springs, and 
Manitou Springs.

Special importance has been attached to lithium, wliich is often 
present in sodium chlorid waters, and wliich is l)elieved to have 
a s])ecial effect in dissolving uric acid. It is very doubtful if 
sucli an action occurs, yet these waters ])ossess a markedly 
diuretic action. They are useful in tlie treatment of gout, and 
of renal and urinary concretions. Among tlie most important 
simple sodium chlorid wat(n-s may be mentioned those of Ham- 
l)urg, Baden-Baden, Kissingen, Wiesl)aden, Pyrmont, Byron 
Springs in California, Congress, Excelsicn*, Ilatliorn, High

Sulphated Iron Waters. — These waters contain princii)ally fer- 
rous sulphate, in addition to sodium, magnesium, and calcium 
sulphate. Many of these waters also contain arsenic, alum, and 
sulphuric acid in small amounts. Tliey are especially indicated 
in cases of chronic diarrhea, in anemic children, in chronic gas- 
tric catarrh, in ulcer of the stomacli, and in chronic malarial 
cachexia. These waters should l)e given cautiously, as at times 
they produce indigestion and nausea. They are best taken in 
small individual doses. Among the ])rinci})al sulphated iron 
waters are those of Sharon Chalybeate Spring, Bedford Alum 
Spring, Fauquier White Sulphur Springs, and Rockbridge 
Alum Springs.

ized by the presence of large amoinits of calcium and magne- 
sium salts. They diminish the production of acid in the stom- 
ach, and also the secretions from the res])iratory, digestive, and 
urinary tracts. They are indicated especially in chronic catarrh 
of the urinary organs, in uric acid diathesis, gout, scroi'uhi, 
and rachitis. In drinking these waters small (juantiti«'s shouhl 
be taken at first, and gradually increased until the flow of urint> 
is markedly increased. Among these waters are tliosi' of Con-

VII. Acratothermal Waters. — These waters^ also known 
as simple or '^ indifferent " waters, are cliaracterized by the 
fact that t]icy are obtained at a temperature of 85° F. or over. 
They do not, however, contain any active mineral ingredients. 
Tliey are rarely nsed for drinking purposes, but are used 
mainly for thermal baths. (For a more com]>lete description 
of mineral waters and their uses the reader is referred to the 
recent and most excellent volume on ^^ Balneology and Cruno- 
therapy " l)y Kisch, Hinsdale, and Peale, in Colien's Si/,stei/i 
of J-'hifsio/or/ir Thera i>eitfi<'.H, vol. ix.) 



Diet at Water Cures. — Water cures .should always be 
carried out at the watering-places. Under exceptional circum- 
stances a water cure may be ordered at the ])atient's home, but 
the results are never us sntisfact(»ry as when the patient has a 
change of air, of scene, ])lenty <»f out-door exercise, and freedom 
froiu care and worry. Tlie methods and the diet vary greatly 
at different springs, and for tlie most ])art unnecessarily so. 
Manv of the diets and methods are em})iric and are not founded 
on any sound basis. Certain articles are forbidden at certain 
springs, often for most fanciful reasons. Thv routine and the 
diet of manv springs is the same f tr all ])ati('nts, (juite regardless 
of the nature of the disease. An im})ortant factor in the failure

WATER. l(jli 

of water cures is the abuse of water drinkinir. Patients willi 
weak hearts, chronic nephritis, oi- dihited and atonic stornaclis 
may easily take more water than can he (nsj)(»s('d of, arid jMisitixc 
injury may result. 

As a rule, the water should be taken in the niorniiiL: after 
rising, and from 200 to SOO c. cm. should l)e (iruId^ slow Iv, pre- 
ferably whilst the patient strolls about. One-lialf hour- -liould 
invariably elapse before eating, and it" lai-ge <pianlitie- d" waier 
are taken one hour shoidd be the shoi-test inter-val hetwcf'n tlie 
water and food. Breakfast should be Ibllowed 1)\- walkinu ">r 
other out-door amusements and, it' the patient is not obc-e and 
requires it, half an hour or an hour's rest may be taken bcfdic 
and after the midday meal. In some cases water is taken hc- 
tween breakfast and the midday meal. 

The afternoon should be spent out of doors if pos>il)le, and 
water may in some cases be taken in the afternoon, at lea-i half 
an hour before afternoon tea or colfee. The evenini;- meal .-lioiild 
be light and taken not later than seven o'clock, and the pati( iit 
should be in bed by nine o'clock, (^are should be taken not to 
disturb too radically the habits of the old and inlirni, as by -o 
doing often more harm than good may result. 

The diet ordered will, of course, depend upon the nature nf 
the disease. In general, it may be stated that the diet -hniild 
be that which the patient's condition calls tor, and n(»t t!ie mere 
or less arbitrary diet of the })articiilar s[)ring \\liieh the paiii nt 
visits. Healthy individtials may take the strict cui-es if ih.v 
so desire, and often find the change interesting and feel l)ci;< r 
for the mental effect so produced. In a genera.l ^\ay the d!' t 
cures at watering-places f )r!)id meats diHiciilt of (ligestion, as

berries in some place-, nuts as well as all very highly -ca-oricd 
and complicated dishes, cheese, etc. 

In general, all strong alcoholic beveraL^-es are ini-hiddcn. Imi, 
as a rule, light wine or beer is allowable in -mall (Hiantiiic- if 
the patient can be trusted not to take to much. (\.lfee and iea

broken. The advice of an enlightened physician at the cure is 
very valuable. 

Besides water, there are a number of beverages that serve 
not only to meet the physical needs of the body, but are also 
taken to produce a stimulant effect. They also serve the pur- 
pose of a stimulant where such is necessary from time to time, 
as in the case of disease. The habit of using beverages, either 
for the purpose of relieving fatigue or for conviviality, is most 
pernicious, as it is apt to induce a habit for taking such drinks, 
which in time leads to excesses. We shall now take up in 
order the other beverages — tea, coffee, cocoa, and the various 
alcoholic stimulants. 



TEA. 

Tea is a preparation made from the leaves of an evergreen 
plant known as Thea. It is grown in China, Japan, India, 
Ceylon, and in North Carolina. There are many varieties of 
the plant, and the flavor of tea varies with its source and the 
variety of the plant. There are two great classes of teas, the 
green and the black, the distinction between the two being due 
to the method of preparation. Several times during the year 
the plant sends out young shoots, which are picked as often as 
they appear. Black tea is prepared by exposing the fresh 
leaves to the rays of the sun ; after they have become withered 
the constituents are liberated by rolling and breaking up the 
fibers and cells of the leaf. The broken-up leaves are then 
collected and allowed to ferment while still moist ; during this 
process the tannic acid is rendered less soluble while the essen- 
tial oils are increased. After again exposing them to the sun 
tlie leaves are dried in an oven. In the process of preparing 
green tea the Chinese " wither " the leaves in pans at a temper- 
ature of 160° F. ; the Japanese steam them. The fluid principles 
are then liberated l)y breaking up the leaves ; finally they are 
again withered, sweated in bags, and slowly roasted. The 
chief difference between black and green tea lies in the flict 
that black tea is fermented while green is not. As in the 
])rocess of fermentation the tannic acid becomes less soluble, 
black tea contains much less tannic acid than green tea. The 
following table, from Bannist^ir,^ gives the composition of black 
and of green tea :

Tea has practically no nntrient-ino;re(li('nts. Its prliicijKil vnn- 
stitiieuts are caifeiii and tannic acid, and its special aroma i> 
due to a volatile oil. It owes its stinndatino; eiVcct to the pres- 
ence of caffein. As the action of tannic acid is dcti-inicntal to 
the process of digestion, tea should be so ])repai-('d as to contain 
as large a proportion of catiein as possible and the -niallcst 
possible amount of tannic acid. 

When the leaves are placed in boiling writer, ('aH'cin is ex- 
tracted very ra])idly. Tannic acid, however, is niueh le-s 
soluble; it follows, therefore, that in order to have as little 
tannic acid in the tea as possible, the leaves shoidd be boiled in 
water for as short a time as practicable. To prepare the iid'usion 
pour boiling water on the tea-leaves andallowthe mixture to stand 
where it will keep hot, though not boil, for from three to five min- 
utes. Water used in preparing tea should not be hard or stale. 

When the tannic acid which tea contains occurs in large 
quantities, the pepsin of the gastric juice is precipitated ; in 
weaker solutions tea retards digestion. ]''or these reasons tea is 
not a suitable beverage for persons suffering Ironi gastric dis- 
turbances. Among the more prominent symptoms of e\ee.-~i\ »> 
tea-drinking are gastric disorders, cardiac distress, and a variety 
of nervous symptoms, such as excitability, sleeplessne>s, and 
muscular incoordination. 



COFFEK 

Coffee was introduced into Euro])e in the snm(> century as 
tea, and only a few years later. It is prepared iVoiii tlu^ seed- 
of Coffea arahica, which was originally grown in Ai-abia, but 
has since been cultivated in Java, Ceylon, Costa Rica, and 
Brazil. The fruit of the plant, which has the appearance ot" a 
cherry, when opened discloses the coifee-bean. In order to 
prepare the beans for use they are dried at a high temperattu'e 
and then roasted and iri'ound. In roastiiiir, one-tifth of the 



172 BEVERAGES AND STIMULANTS. 

caifein and one-tenth of the fat present are lost. The aroma 
of coffee is due to the presence of caffeol, an oil liberated in 
roasting. According to Hutchison (p. 310), a cup of black 
coffee contains about as large a quantity of tannic acid and 
caffein as a cup of tea. Coffee is often adulterated, chicory, 
acorns, and other substances being added for this purpose. The 
adulteration may not be injurious in its effect, but alters, some- 
times even agreeably, the flavor of the coffee. 

Preparation of Coffee. — In order to obtain coffee of the 
finest flavor, the beans should be roasted and ground shortly 
before they are to be used, as the flavor is impaired by expos- 
ure to the air after grinding. The water should have reached 
the boiling-point before it is poured over the coffee. The pot 
should then be placed for a few moments in a hot })lace, but 
boiling must not be allowed to continue, or the aroma will be 
lost and the coffee contiiin too large a percentage of tannic acid. 

The effect of coffee on the system is that of a stimulant, due 
to the caffein present ; it acts directly on the cerebral centers, 
stimulates the heart, and deepens the respirations. It is an 
excitant of the nervous system, and in some persons produces 
nervousness, excitability, and insonmia ; in others it acts as an 
agreeable stimulant. In persons suffering from dyspepsia it 
has a tendency to disturb digestion. It lessens the strain of 
fatigue, and soldiers frequently (le})end upon its stimulating 
effect during large marches.

hroma cacao. The seeds are eontaincHl in a }>iilpv fruit, .some- 
what resembliiif^ a ciiciiiriber, from which tlicv are ( xtractcd. 
The fruit is gathered into heaps and allowed to jermcnt, when 
the pulp becomes h)osened. Diirini:: this pi-oc*-- the sced-^ 
become dark and h:)se some of their bitterne.-s. 'I'hev are then 
roasted, by which ])r()cess they n re broken into l»it<, const ilntini^ 
the so-caHed ^^cocoa nibs." A decoction ol' cocoa nib- is made 
by boiling the seeds in water for sev<>r;d hours and i-emoviuLr 
the residue by straining. Cocoa, as oi-dinarilv pi-epai-ed, is 
made by grinding the seeds into a paste, to which -ULiar or 
starch is added; if starch is used, tlui cocoa is boiled tor a few 
minutes, but if sugar is addinl, the cocoa only i-e(iuires the addi- 
tion of boibng water or milk. 

Theobromin, the chief alkaloid ])resent in cocoa, occurs in 
amounts of from 1 to 2 per cent. Cocoa also contains nitro- 
genous substances, 15 per cent. ; tiinnic acid, o j)cr cent. ; 
starch, 5 to 15 per cent. ; fat, known as cocoa-butter, 15 to 50 
per cent. ; mineral constituents, 2 to ''\ per cent. 

Theobromin, while a stimulant, is less apt to induce nervous 
symptoms, such as sleeplessness and palpitation, than either t^'a 
or coffee. By reason of the large proportion of sugar and Cat 
contained in it, however, when used in excess, cocoa is likelv 
to produce indigestion. When not too rich, it forms a nutri- 
tious drink especially useful for children and for convalescent,--.

cent, of theobromine 15 per cent, of fat, 5 per cent, of nitrog- 
enous substances, and about 60 per cent, of sugar. 

In addition to their stimulating effect, cocoa and chocolate 
possess a marked nutrient value not possessed by either tea or 
coffee. 

The kola nut possesses properties similar to those of cocoa. 
It contains an alkaloid, cafPein, thein, or theobromin. 



ALCOHOL. 

Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of sugars with 
yeast, and the princii)al constituent in all alcoholic beverages is 
ethyl alcohol, although other constituents may modify the action 
of various beverages so that the effect produced is not always 
exactly the same. The glucose contained in fruits is fermented 
directly into alcohol, whereas the starches, in such substances as 
potatoes, grains, etc., are converted into dextrin and maltose, 
and then by the aid of diastatic ferments, before the alcoholic 
fermentation can take place, they are converted into glucose. 

Alcohol has a food value of 7 calorics per gram, and the law 
of the conservation of energy obtains with the alcohol diet just 
as with the ordinary diet, and the energy of the alcohol oxidized 
in the body is transformed completely into kinetic energy and 
appears either as heat, or as muscular work, or both. To this 
extent, at any rate, it is used like the energy of protein, fats, 
and carbohydrates. The fat protection following the use of 
alcohol is very slightly different from tliat of ordinary food, and 
it apparently protects the body fat quite as effectively as do the 
fats and carbohydrates for which it is substituted. The power 
of alcohol to protect the protein of food or body tissue, or both, 
from consumption has been clearly demonstrated by Atwater. 
Its action in this respect appears to be similar to that of the 
carbohydrates and fats, and in tliis way alcohol serves the body 
as food. In some cases it is ap])arently equal, and in others 
inferior, to fat and carbohydrate, but it is by no means certain 
that tliese latter are always equal to each other in this power. 
At times it seems to exert a special action, and in large quanti- 
ties is positively toxic and may retard, or even prevent, meta- 
bolism in general, and ])rotein metabolism in particular. On 
the other hand, in small doses it seems, at times, to have an 
opposite influence, tending to increase disintegration of protein. 
This action, though not conclusively demonstrated, is very 
probal)le, and thus affords a satisfactory explanation for the 



ALCOHOL. 17 -J 

occasional failure of alcohol to ])r(it('rt protein. Atwatcr 
states that the only justification for calliiifi: uIcoIk.I a protein 
poison is found in this disintegrating^ tendency. Tlii^ action 
appears to be temporary and most liable to occm- in jxM.plc 
little accustomed to its use, and the circunistances under which 
it occurs Ciumot be fully defnuHh In niodeiate (piantiiie- 
alcohol produces no considerable increase in the anioinit of Ik at 
radiated from the body, but in larire ((uantities it cau-es a dila- 
tation of the vessels of the skin, increases the cireiilaiion 
through the vessels near the surface, and thus inci-ease- heat 
radiation. 

The question of alcohol as a source of nuiseiilar eneiyv i- 
one of considerable interest. It would seem, from At\\at<i"> 
experiments, that it contributes its share for nuiscular work, but 
its desirability as a part of the diet for nuiscular work mu-t be 
decided not on this fact alone, but on the eil'ect of the alcohol 
on the character of work. Alcohol has a favorable action on 
the performance of muscular work both when the muscles are 
vigorous and when they are exhausted, and this cllet't is >een 
almost immediately after the administration, but lasts foi-a very 
short time and is succeeded by a paralyzing action. This later 
paralyzing action overbalances the })rimary stimulating eUcct, 
so that the sum total of the amount of work done with alci)hol 
is less than that done without it. Similar de])ressing eifect^ are 
not seen to follow the use of tea, coifee, or kola. In practical 
tests with the use of alcohol in the diet of people engaged in 
muscular labor it seemed to prove that the subjects work to a 
slightly better advantage with ordinary rations than with tho^e 
containing alcohol. 

Atwater found that the effect of alcohol in small ({uantities is 
slightly to increase the digestibility of })roteins, but not to alt 
the digestibility of other nutrients, that is, carbohydrates : 
fats. At least 98 per cent, of alcohol ingested is oxidi 
in the body, whereas ordinarily 98 per cent, of carbohydrates, 
95 per cent, of fats, and 93 per cent, of proteins are oxidized. 
The rapidity with which alcohol is absorbed, and the ease with 
which it is oxidized, make it a valuable adjunct in feeding 
individuals in extreme wasted conditions, as in prolonged 
fevers. 

Quite as important as Atwater's experiments on the nutritive 
value of alcohol is the valuable review of Abel on the 
" Pharmacologic and Physiologic Action of Alcohol,'^ publis 
in Physiologic Aspects of the Liquor Problem.

As far as experimental evidence goes, if alcohol is introduced 
into the body without local irritation, it is, strictly speaking, not 
a circulatory stimulant. In moderate quantities it has no effect 
on the heart itself, and neither stimulates nor depresses it, but 
this statement is based on laboratory experiments covering only 
a short period of time and may not hold good for the effect in 
the prolonged daily use. Large quantities of alcohol weaken 
the heart. It has no action either on the peripheral or central 
ends of the nerves which control the rate and force of the heart, 
except under unusual circumstances, as in prolonged or severe 
intoxication. In moderate quantities it has no effect on the 
arterial blood-pressure, but when sufficient has been given to 
induce a change it is a fall and not a rise, except under certain 
circumstances, where the circulatory a}:)])aratus is in an abnormal 
condition. In the early stages of its action it causes some 
flushing of the skin and brain, and later, when very large 
quantities have been taken, dilatation of the abdominal vessels 
occurs. Tlie fall of blood-pressure due to very large quantities 
is a toxic phenomenon, and is due to tlie depressant action of 
the alcohol on the nervous centers which control the calibers of 
the arteries and also in part to the weakened heart. When 
alcohol is introduced into the circulation it acts as a narcotic, but 
owing to its local effect on the mucous membranes, and through 
its cerebral action on the various parts of the circulatory system, 
a train of phenomena may be produced which justify, to a cer- 
tain degree, the term " circulatory stimulant." Most common 
of these is the slowing or quickening of the pulse-rate, as 
frecjuently observed in medical practice. 

Oil the respiration alcohol acts as a respiratory stinuilant of 
moderate j^ower for liuman beings. During a period of an hour 
or more after its administration it causes an increase in the 
volume of air passing through the lungs and in the absorption 
of oxygen (.'].5 per cent.). 

Highly flavored wines, brandy and other alcoholic bever- 
ages which contain larger amounts of stimulating esters, 
have a more pronounced action than ethyl alcohol, and the 
stimulating action of alcoholic beverages is greater in the case 
of fatigued j^ersons than in those in nowise exhausted. In- 
creased heat dissipation always accom})anies the above-named 
effects. The compensatory increase in hciit production requires 
an increase in the oxidative ])rocesses in the tissues, and the 
increased demands for oxygen is the direct cause of the increased 
activity of the respiratory center. Small doses of alcohol have

also the effect of increasing the movements of the digestive 
tract and of causing a state of unrest or tension in tlie 
skeletal muscles, and thus further adding to tlie demand for 
oxygen. 

How far the action of alcohol on tlie central nervous system, 
and how far its influence as a protophismic jxtison may modi{\- 
its operation as an antipyretic; how far variations in the exter- 
nal temperature, in the humidity of the air, and in the tempera- 
ture of the body itself influence its action, must all ree<'ive 
further study. In a word, the detailed chemic and phvsiologie 
studies similar to those that have been made on other antipy- 
retics are demanded. Such studies will probablv tend to hai- 
monize the conflicting views at present entertained in regard to 
the use of alcohol in fever, and explain the more deleterious 
eflects of alcohol in polar and tropical, as compared with tem- 
perate regions 

The effect of alcohol on the digestion and secretion is to in- 
crease the flow of saliva from the stimulating eflect of the alco- 
holic beverage in the mouth. This acceleration of secretion is, 
however, of brief duration. Not only is the volume of saliva 
increased, but also the organic and inorganic constituents. This 
effect is in no sense peculiar to alcohol, but is common to many 
so-called stimulants. Upon the gastric secretion alcohol and 
alcoholic liquids have a marked eflect, increasing both the quan- 
tity of gastric juice, the amount of acid, and the total solids, 
and this action is exerted not only by the j)resence of alcoholic 
beverages in the stomach, but also indirectly through the in- 
fluence of alcohol absorbed from the intestine. This increase in 
the flow of gastric juice may counterbalance^ the greatei' or lesser 
retardation of the digestive changes caused by alcoholic bever- 
ages. This retardation may not be great in some instances, 
owing to the rapid disappearance of the alcohol from the ali- 
mentary canal. 

The effect of alcohol on the nervous system varies greatly in 
different races, in different individuals, and under ditfcrent cir- 
cumstances, and there are also variations in its action according 
to the choice of beverage, though this is by no means constant. 
The environment is another factor, and gay companions, bright 
light, and music increase the exhilarating eflects. In small 
quantities it produces, in most individuals, a feeling of well- 
being and good fellowship, and, in larger quantities, it causes a 
tendency to loquacity, gesticulation, and a feeling of self-confi- 

12

dence. The face is usually flushed, the eyes brighter, and the 
self-control lessened. In still larger quantities, the individual 
becomes boistorous, may wish to sing, shout, fight, and in other 
ways disregard the ordinary conventions of life. Larger quan- 
tities are liable to be followed by muscular incoordination, 
shown in the uncertain movements, staggering gait, and stam- 
mering speech. Sooner or later sleep follows, from which the 
individual awakes with various unpleasant symptoms, chief of 
which are thirst, nausea, vomiting, headache, and neuralgia, 
and sometimes acute or subacute gastritis. After very large 
quantities a condition resembling chloroform anesthesia super- 
venes. 

There are two opinions concerning the action of alcohol on 
the nervous system, that of Binz and otliers, who believe that it 
first stimulates and then depresses, and that of Schmiedeburg, 
Bunge, and others, who think that it depresses from the start, 
and explain the apparent stimulation by a depression of the 
inhibitory centers. 

On the intellectual faculties the receptive powers are lessened 
even by small quantities, but small C[uantities lessen the time 
required for simple association processes, such as rhyming, while 
larger quantities depress all the intellectual faculties. The indi- 
vidual often believes he is doing better work and more quickly, 
when, in reality, the work is not as good, and takes a longer 
time than without the alcohol. Experiments with typesetters 
and others show that alcohol causes the worker to make a 
greater number of errors than he would without it. 

The deleterious effects of larger quantities of alcohol than the 
individual can metabolize, continued over long periods of time, 
are too familiar to need description. While it is true that many 
individuals take considerable alcohol daily over long periods of 
time without causing any pathologic clianges, we have demon- 
strated on animals and it is frequently seen in man tliat cirrhosis 
of the liver, kidney, and other organs may l)e caused by alcohol, 
although fatty degeneration of the liver, kidneys, heart, and ves- 
sels is rather tlie more common change. The more concentrated 
the alcohol and the larger the cpiantity taken in a single dose, 
the more lial)le is alcohol to cause tissue changes. There is con- 
sidera})le reason to believe that alcohol is not as great a factor 
in curing arteriosclerosis as was formerly believed. 

The Use of Alcohol as a Food and in Medicine. —

sweeping condemnation tliat it has r<H'<'ivc(l from manv (juartn-s 
in recent years is not merited. The use and ahusc have liccii 
confnsed. 

As a food it can be ntili/ed only within certain limits, as 
only what wonld represent '1 ounces of alcohol can he inctah- 
olized by the average individual within twent v-loiii- houi-. 
For some this is too low an estimate, and lor other- csen thi- 
amount conld not be utilized without the j)ro(liiction ot" -viiip- 

toms or nnpleasant after-eil'ects. In ie\-er- and other c ii- 

tions, where sufficient food cannot l)e [idniinistered, alcoliol nia\- 
be added to the diet with good elfeet, and in toxic c(.n.!iii(.ii-, 
such as are often seen in typlioid, it is of incalculahle \alue. It 
is readily absorbed, easily assimilated, and seems in the-e tnxic 
cases to aid in combating the toxemia. 

It is frequently used as a stomachic, to produce an apix'- 
tite and to stimulate the secretion of gastric juice. It ad- al-o 
as a respiratory stinudant, and may be used in conditiun- n\' 
heart weakness and disturbances of the circulation, as throu-h 
its cerebral and local action it may infiuenee the circulaii(»n 
favorably, causing, as it w^re, the re-establishment of more oi- 
less normal conditions by dilating superficial ves-els, aiul l)\- 
slowing or accelerating the pulse-rate, and by its nnnierou< 
indirect influences causing a different balance in the })art< and 
functions of the vasculatory apparatus. 

It is contraindicated in individuals ^vlio have ])revi(tu-ly been 
victims of the alcohol habit and are lial)le to ae(iuire it again, 
and in individuals who come from famihes that are ])rone to 
form drug habits. It should not i)e used where it ean-es un- 
pleasant symptoms or excitement, although these may l)e due 
to too large doses. If the odor is apparent on. the breath >onie 
time after the administration, it is verv ])robable that the (pian- 
tity administere<l has been too great. Small, repeated dose>, well 
diluted with water, give better results than larger or mnre con- 
centrated doses. The best indications that the alcohol is well 
borne is a change for the better in the general appearance and 
condition, wdtli improved circulation as evidenced in the appear- 
ance, pulse-rate, arterial tension, and the (juality of the lieart 
sounds. In severe toxic conditions, from }, to 1 ounce of 
whisky and, in some instances, more may be given every one, 
two, or three hours, according to the eflect ])roduced. 

Consumption of Alcohol. — According to Thom])sou, 
the total consumption of alcoholic beverages a year in America 
is more than 1,000,000,000 gallons. The following table, 



180 BEVERAGES AND STIMULANTS. 

taken from Thompson's Dietetics, p. 239, gives the annual per 
capita consumption of alcoholic beverages in 1890 : 

Beer. Wine. Spirits. 

England 30.31 0.39 1.02

ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. 

Alcoholic beverages are divided into several classes, e. g., 
spirits, liqueurs and bitters, malt liquors, wines, etc. 

SPIRITS. 

Spirits are produced by fermenting saccharine substances 
and obtaining the alcohol by distillation. Of these substances, 
corn, rice, barley, molasses, and potatoes are those most com- 
monly utilized for this purpose. In addition to the alcohol, 
by-products are formed, and it is to these that spirits owe their 
characteristic flavor and odor. The by-products contain the 
higher alcohols, such as proj^yl, butyl, and amyl alcohol, this 
mixture forming what is know^n as fusel oil. 

Whisky. — The United States Pharmacopeia defines whisky 
as ^' an alcoholic liquid obtained by distillation of the mash 
of fermented grain (usually of mixtures of corn, wheat, and rye) 
aud at least four years old." Whisky possesses an alcoholic 
strength of from 50 to 58 per cent, by volume. It should be 
free from disagreeable odor. The ether and aldehyds contained 
in whisky become altered in character as it ages, and the flavor 
is thus rendered more agreeable. 

Brandy. — Tn the United States Pharmacopeia brandy is 
defined as an '' alcoholic liquid obtained by the distillation of 
the fermented unmodified juice of fresh grapes, and at least 
four years old." Brandy contains from 46 to 55 per cent, by 
volume of aleohol. The quality of brandy depends upon the 
variety of gra])es used and u])on the length of time the brandy 
is allowed to stand : the older the brandy, the better the quality. 
With brandy, just as with whiskey, on standing ethers and alde- 
hyds are produced to whi(;h the sj)ecial flavor of the brandy is due. 

Tlie color of brandy is due to the tannic acid extracted from 
the ojik casks in w^liich the brandy is contained. There are 
many inferior grades of brandy on the market, some being 
merely alcohol coloj-ed aud flavored with various essences. 



ALCOHOL. LSI 

Rum. — Rum is tlie ])i-()(lii('t of the distillation of f('nn('iit<'(l 
molasses, its flavor bein<j^ due to certain hv-products. Some of 
the so-called ^^rum'^ of the market is made by addin<j: various 
essences to alcohol. On stundin<r, by the development (»f 
special aldehyds antl etliers, rum imj)roves in (|nalitv. It eon- 
tains about the same ])ereenta<i;e of alcohol as do brandx and 
whisky. 

Gin. — Gin is produced by the distillation of rve and malt 
mash, its flavor being due to juniper berries wliich ;n-e added 
during fermentation. Inferior grades of gin are mamifaetnred 
by adding juniper berries, turpentine, etc., t(» ale(»liol. (iin 
contains from 15 to 20 per cent, of alcoliol ; but the .-ireiiLiih i- 
sometimes increased by tlie addition of alc<)hol^ so that it niav 
contain as much as 35 per cent, of alcohol. 

LIQUEURS AND BITTERS. 

Liqueurs or cordials and bitters contain a large j)roporiioii 
of alcohol, and a high percentage of sugar and es-ential oil-. 
The following table gives the com]K)sition of some of the more 
common liqueurs and bitters :

MALT LIQUORS. 

Under the heading of malt liquors are included beer or ale 
and stout or porter. These beverages are made by ll-rmenting 
malt and hops. Malt is ])roduced by allowing moi>iened barh y 
to germinate at a moderate tem])erature ; in tliis ])roeess the 
diastatic ferment acts upon the starcli, converting it into sugar 
and dextrin. After drying and grinding, the malt is mixed 
with water and thus made into a mash, which is again heated, 
thus more completely changing the starclies into sugar. 

Beer. — The quality of the beer depends largely u})on the 



182 



BEVERAGES AND STIMULANTS. 



temperature at which the process of manufacture is carried on. 
Pale beer is produced by drying the mash at low temperature, 
whereas the darker beers are the result of drying the malt at a 
higher temperature. The infusion of malt is termed " mash.^^ 
The diastatic action of malt is inhibited by boiling the " mash ^' 
with hops ; in this way tannic acid and extractives are with- 
drawn. The mash is now cooled and fermented with yeast. 
In order to secure a pure beer^ great caution must be exercised 
to procure pure yeast. The yeast that rises to the surface after 
fermentation is skimmed off, the remainder settling at the 
bottom. Beer is now placed in casks, the yeast which was 
allowed to remain continuing to produce fermentation. The 
longer this process is allowed to continue, the stronger is the 
percentage of alcohol in beer. The mild or bitter beers are 
distinguished by the relative proportion of hops contained in 
them ; the milder forms contain considerable quantities of hops, 
whereas the bitter ones contain but small amounts. 

Volatile bodies are also produced which, in addition to the 
carbonic acid gas formed, add to the pleasant flavor of the beer. 
In order to add to the keeping qualities of beer various pre- 
servatives are added, such as calcium sulpliate, salicylic acid, etc. 
These substances not only affect the flavor of the beer, but when 
taken in large quantities have a deleterious effect on the system. 

Porter and Stout. — Porter and stout are made by fer- 
menting malt, the latter, however, being roasted, during which 
process a certain amount of caramel is produced. It is to this 
substance that the dark color is due. Beer as well as stout 
contains from 3 to 8 per cent, of alcohol, from 2 to 5 per cent, 
of dextrin, and from 0.5 to 1 per cent, of sugar.

liquors :

Among the constituents of the juice of the grape are albu- 
minous substances, grape- and fruit-sugar, and tartaric and tannic 
acids. The yeast that grows upon the albumins ferments the 
sugar, with the production of alcohol. The character of the wine 
depends upon the quantity of albuminous material present : if 
there is little albumin, the yeast soon ceases in its work of con- 
verting sugar into alcohol, in consequence of which the wine

produced is sweet ; on the otlier hand, if there is nnich albu- 
minous material present, the yeast continues to «,^r()w until all 
the sugar is converted into alcohol, in consecjucnce of which a 
dry or acid wine is produced. 

Ordinarily, wine does not contain more tluin 10 per cent, oi" 
alcohol, inasmuch as the action of the yeast is inhihitcd hv this 
percentage of alcohol. Frecpiently, however, wine is " fortified " 
by the addition of alcohol; this is ti'iie of ])oi-t, wliieli is always 
" fortified.'' 

The yeast used in the fermentation of ii:raj)e-juiee is ol)tained 
in pure cultures and added to the juice to })rodue(! the rctjuircd 
flavor. 

The methods of wdne-production vary greatly, and r((|iiir<' 
no description here. Suffice it to say that the fermentation at 
first lasts from three to six weeks ; the albuminous material is 
removed a number of times, and the wine is then placed in 
casks; here the percentage of alcohol increases, and the color 
of the wine becomes fixed. Fermentation still goes on, how- 
ever, and may continue for many years, thus increasing the 
percentage of alcohol. 

Ethers are also produced, which continue to l^e foi-med even 
after the wine has been placed in bottles. The color of red 
wine is due to a coloring-matter contained in the skin of the 
grapes. 

Of the important ingredients of wine, may be mentioneil 
water, acids, alcohol, sugar, ethers, glycerin, and extractives. 

Acids. — The most important acids contained in wine are 
tartaric, malic, and tannic ; others of less im])ortance ai-e acetic 
and succinic. Tartaric acid occurs in combination with potas- 
sium as potassium bitartrate. The total amount of acids in 
wine varies, but rarely exceeds 0.5 per cent. 

Alcohol. — There are several alcohols present in wine ; ethyl 
alcohol occurs in largest quantity; amyl, pro})yl, and bntyl 
alcohol are also present in varying amounts. As has been 
stated, natural wine never contains more than 1() per cent. 
of alcohol; if it contains more than this amount, it has been 
*' fortified.'^ This is often done, es])ecially when the wine is to 
be shipped from ^varm countries to foreign districts, to prevent 
it souring. 

Sugar. — Sour wines contains about 1 per cent., a!id sweet 
wines about 4 per cent., of sugar; it is evident, therefore, tluit 
sugar is present in too small a quantity to be of any food- 
value. 



186 BEVERAGES AND STIMULANTS. 

Ethers. — Many varieties of ethers are present in wine ; they 
are produced by the action of the alcohols and acids upon each 
other. It is to the character and quantity of the ethers con- 
tained in them that the flavor of various kinds of wines is 
largely due. 

Glycerin. — Glycerin is present in wine in about one-four- 
teenth of the volume of the alcohol. 

Extractives. — A large part of the solid material of the wine 
is made up of extractives, mainly the carbohydrates, as pectins 
and gums. 

Varieties of Wines. — From a dietetic standpoint the 
classification of Chambers is probably the most practical ; ac- 
cording to this author, wines are divided into seven classes : 

1. Strong dry wines. 4. Acid wines. 

2. Strong sweet wines. 5. Sparkling wines. 

3. Aromatic wines. 6. Perfect wines. 

7. Rough or astringent wines. 

1. Strong Dry Wines. — These are wines that contain a 
large percentage of alcohol, to which, as a rule, additional 
alcohol has been added in their production ; in other words, 
they are ^' fortified. '' Examples of this class of wines are 
port, sherry, and Madeira. In cases of fever these wines are 
utilized in place of whisky. Port contains from 15 to 20 per 
cent, of alcohol and considerable tannic acid. Sherry is a 
fortified wine; it contains from 15 to 22 per cent, of alcohol. 

2. Strong Sweet Wines. — These wines contain fruit-sugar 
in quantities sufficient to act as a preservative and prevent 
further fermentation. Under this head may be mentioned 
Tokay, Malaga, and sweet champagne. They contain from 
18 to 22 per cent, of alcohol and from 3 to 5 per cent, of 
sugar. Owing to their sweetness they are taken in small 
quantities. 

3. Aromatic Wines. — Aromatic Avines possess a superior 
flavor and contain essential oils and considerable alcohol ; ex- 
amples of this class of wines are MoseHe, Ca})ri, and some of 
the Ivhine wines. 

4. Acid Wines. — Tlie distinguishing feature of tliis class of 
wines is the large (juantity of acid they contain. 

5. Sparkling Wines. — Sparkling wines contain considerable 
quantities of car])onic acid gas, to which their exhilarating 
eflect is due. The chief varietv of this class of wines is

l.s- 



champagne. The dryness or sweetness of chanijiajrne (lejH'iKls 
upon the proportion of cane-sntz;iir and cooiiac added (hn-inu 
the process of manufacture. In tlie niaiiufacturc of (h'v cliam- 
pagne 8 per cent, of sugar is a<ld('(l, while the swcrt brands 
contiun as much as 16 })er cent. Since drv chanipaLrnc docs 
not contain large quantities of sugar, and since the hirger part 
of the sugar it originally contained has disa])peared (hn-iug fer- 
mentation, it is considered less likely to produce llatulcnce, and 
is therefore preferred by invalids. Dry chani])agiic is a pure 
wine containing from 9 to 12 ])er cent, ol' alcohol and from 1 
to 4 per cent, of sugar. 

6. Perfect Wines. — Perfect wines are deiined by ('hanil)ers 
as those containing alcohol, water, sugar, ethereal tlaNors, fruity 
extractives, and acids. Under this head come i^urguudy and 
Bordeaux. Burgundy contains a rather large percentage of 
alcohol and extractive matter; it is, therefore, said to have 
considerable ^^ body." Good Bordeaux wines are thoroughly 
fermented, and, together with the Ijurgundies, contain very 
little sugar ; they are, therefore, well borne by invalids, and arc 
especially useful as tonics during convalescence from j)rotracted 
illnesses. 

Rough Wines. — Kough wines contain considerable (quantities 
of tannic acid, to which they owe their astringent elfect. 
They contain little alcohol, and are of slight value for medicinal 
purposes.

composition of some wines :

ACTION AND THERAPEUTIC USE OF MALT LIQUORS AND WINES. 

Malt liquorsj when taken in moderate quantities, seem to aid 
digestion, increase the appetite, and stimulate gastric secretion. 
Occasionally, especially in those who lead a sedentary life, they 
give rise to indigestion and gastric acidity. On account of the 
large quantities of carbohydrates they contain they have con- 
siderable food-value. The use of malt liquors is contraindi- 
cated especially in such conditions as gout, obesity, diabetes, 
and diseases of the urinary tract. 

Wines appear to exert a depressing effect on the gastric 
secretion. Taken in moderate quantities, however, by increasing 
the appetite and the motor function of the stomach, this de- 
pressing effect is not only overcome, but the digestion is also 
greatly improved. 

Anstie ^ gives the following conclusions as to the use of wine 
in health : 

^' Wines for daily use by healthy adults should not on the 
average contain more than 10 per cent, absolute alcohol (by 
weight) ; 8 or 9 per cent, is better. 

" If wine be used as the daily drink, it is best, as far as may 
be, to use only one kind at a time and no other form of alcoholic 
liquor. 

'^ Sound natural wines are to be obtained at the best economic 
advantage from the Bordeaux district ; the red wines are to be 
preferred. Rhine wines (white) are equally excellent, but more 
expensive. 

" Hungarian wines are also in many instances excellent, but 
they are unequal in quality, owing to defects of manufacture. 

^^ Greek wines labor under the same defects. 

^' The fortified wines, as a class, develop no proper vinous 
qualities till they have been for some years in bottle. Sherry, 
however, is greatly superior to the other wines of this class in 
the rapidity with which it develops the volatile ethers. 

'^ Fortified wines in small quantities, especially sherry, for 
the reason just named, are the a})pro])riate stimuli of certain 
kinds of infantile and youthful debility, and of the enfeebled 
nervous system of old persons. 

^' Half a bottle of a natural wine a day for a sedentary and 
a bottle a day for a vigorous and actively employed adult affords 
a reasonable and prudent allowance of alcohol, and this quantity 
of wine, either alone or with water, will be enough to satisfy

be taken." 

CIDER. 

Cider is a beverage prepared from the fermented juice of 
ripe apples. The amount of alcohol contained in this beverage 
varies between 3 and 8 per cent, by volume. It also contains 
malic acid, salts, sugar, albuminoids, and extractives. Cider is 
a diuretic drink and acts as a laxative. On exposure it under- 
goes an acetic acid fermentation, whereby it is rendered unfit 
lor drinking purposes. 

The table on p. 191 ^ gives analyses of American ciders.

VARIOUS FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING 
ON DIET. 

CONCENTRATION OF FOOD. 

COXCEXTEATED foods are those Iroiii which the hirucr por- 
tion of the water present lias been abstracted, and thus the 
weight and the bulk of the food diniini>hc(l. There are 
many patented eoneentrated foods on the market . Thev liiid 
their chief use in the treatment of patients who take too btth> 
of the usual forms of food to maintain streuuth, and, -eeoiid, 
in cases where it is impoi'tant that a large (juantitv ol" iioiiii-h- 
ment be taken. 

Food can be concentrated to various degrees. De-iccated 
meat is the most concentrated form of protein ; sngar, the nio.-t 
concentrated form of carbohydrate; and olive oil, the nio-t 
concentrated f )rm of fat. 

1. Concentrated Proteins. — These fxxls are pr( paivd 
from milk, meat, eggs, and vegetables. Jlcaf is concentrated 
by drying, and in this form it is generally indigestible; Mhich 
can, however, be overcome by predigestion or powdei'ing ; in 
this class of foods are included somatose, pennniean, and 
iMosquera^s "Beef MeaF' (see p. 11>7). Among the con- 
centrated foods derived from the casein of inil/: are nnirose. 
eucasein, etc. (see p. 190). Vv/z/.s- are dried in vncno ; snuar i> 
usually added, and the egii^s are then pnlverize(l. ( )!' ihe 
vegetable proteins utilized in concentratcMl form arc aleuronat 
and legumin. 

2. Concentrated Carbohydrates. — Sugar is the most 
important of the concentrated carbohydrates. In this inrrn, 
however, it is apt to disagree and cause fermentation. To tlii- 
class of concentrated carbohydrates belong the malt extracts. 

3. Concentrated Vegetables. — Many vegetables, such 
as potatoes, carrots, cabbage, and the like, are concentrated l)y 
drying. They are utilized only in those instances in which it 
is impossible to secure fresh vegetables. 

Bread is frequently dried and eaten in the f >rm of " hard- 
tack," when it is impossible, as during voyages, to obtain Iresh 
bread.

194 VABIOUS FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING ON DIET. 

PRESERVATION OF FOOD. 

By preservation of food is meant the process by which the 
food is so changed that it can be kept for a longer or shorter 
period of time without undergoing putrefaction. The process 
of fermentation is induced by micro-organisms present in the 
atmosphere coming into contact with the food and contaminating 
it. Since putrefactive germs require a certain amount of moist- 
ure and heat for their growth, such foods as contain little water 
and that are not kept too warm are not so likely to undergo 
decomposition ; on the other hand, foods containing much water 
undergo fermentation very rapidly. To prevent this process 
four methods of preservation are, according to Yeo/ available : 

1. Drying. 2. Exclusion of the air. 3. Exposure to cold. 
4. Treatment with antiseptic chemic agents. 

1 . Drying. — By this process a large proportion of the water 
is abstracted. Pemmican is a form of meat preserved by this 
method (see p. 196). Vegetables, such as carrots, peas, potatoes, 
etc., are also preserved by drying. Milk, in the form of nutrose, 
eggs, as Qgg powder, and fruits are often preserved in this manner. 

2. !^xcltlsion of Air. — Air may be prevented from com- 
ing into contact with food in a number of ways : by immersing 
the food in oil or fat ; by heating the food, so as to evaporate 
the external layers ; by coating with some impermeable sub- 
stance, as oil, salt, sawdust, varnish, or paraffin. Fish are 
frequently preserved by immersion in oil or by smoking. Ham 
and bacon are preserved by smoking, by which process the 
outer surface becomes coagulated and impermeable. Eggs are 
preserved by covering the fresh eggs with some impermeable 
substance, such as oil, fat, beeswax, or sawdust. In order 
properly to preserve food by exclusion of air it is highly im- 
portant that the food be perfectly fresh, and that any air that 
may be present be expelled. 

In ccmn'mg, the food to be preserved is heated in tin cans 
until steamed, when, all the air having been expelled, the can 
is soldered and rendered air-tight. Various methods have been 
resorted to to obviate the necessity of cooking in preserving 
food. McCall advises the partial exclusion of air and the dis- 
infection of what remains with sodium sulj)hite. A method of 
replacing the air l)y nitrogen and sul2)hurous acid has also been 
recommended. 

3. Exposure to Cold. — Food can be preserved indefi- 
nitely by ice. Meat and fish, which are often preserved by this 

^ Food in Health (ind Visease, p. 176. 



PRESERVATION OE EOOl). 195 

meiins, should be cooked at once after tluiwIiiL'". l^'rozen meat 
loses about 10 per cent, more of its nutritive value in cooking 
than fresh meat. Fre<iuently food is not kept dii-ectly on ice, 
but in refriireratiufr chambers : it can tlius l)c 



inncd many 



.pc 



thousands of miles on land or water without sho\\in<r tlic 
slightest tendency to decomposition. The use of cold storairc 
for indefinite periods of time is to be condemned, and s(orai:e 
warehouses should becom])elled to brand all stored Ibod as sucli, 
as well as with the date of entrance. 

4. Treatment with Antiseptic Chemic Agents. — 
Under ordinary circumstances the only chemic agents allowable 
in preserving food are salt, sugar, vinegar, wood smoke, and s])ices. 

Salting. — The salting of food is a method that has been 
practised for many centuries. In this way meat and iish are 
easily preserved. The pale color of the meat produce<l bv 
salting is overcome by adding a little saltpeter in addition to 
common salt. By salting, considerable proteins are extractcMl 
from the meat — according to Liebig, one-third of the nutritive 
value of the meat is lost in this way. After the salting has 
been accomplished it is often followed by smoking. 

Sugar in strong solution acts as an antiseptic, and fruits are 
thus often preserved in concentrated syru])s. 

Vinegar acts as an antiseptic in preserving cucund)ers, 
pickles, oysters, etc. 

Spices. — Recent observations have shown that certain sjuces 
exert a very marked preservative action. Cinnamon, cloves, and 
mustard are the most powerful, nutmeg and alls])ice somewhat 
less active, while ginger, black and cayenne pepper are ineilective. 

Other Antiseptics for Preserving Foods. — Among 
these substances are sulphur vapor ; weak carbolic acid ; strong 
acetic acid; injections of alum and aluminium chlorid into the 
blood-vessels ; boric acid ; borax ; salicylic acid ; formaldehyd. 

Chittenden and Gies ^ have studied the eilect of borax and 
of boric acid on the general nutrition. They conclude that, 
taken in small doses for a long time, borax does not alter 
metabolism or disturb nutrition. In larfrer doses borax retards 
protein and fat assimilation. In very large doses it causes 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. (See Food Adulteration, p. 
226.) Wiley ^ has made an extended study of food preservatives, 
and concludes that boric acid and borax used even in small 
quantities over long periods of time disturb appetite, digestion 
and the general health. The fact that certain individuals may 
take small amounts of certain food preservatives for long periods

of time without injury is no argument in favor of their use, as 
we have no method of determining who wdll be and who will 
not be injured in this way. AViley states positively that there 
is no necessity for using either chemic preservatives or artificial 
coloring-matter in food-products. Food laws should be enacted 
and carried out prohibiting the use of coloring-matters, chemic 
preservatives, and sophistication of every kind. 

ARTIFICIAL FOOD PREPARATIONS. 

To this class of foods belong those preparations that are so 
concentrated as to furnish a large amount of food in small 
bulk ; being of small bulk, they can be added to liquid foods, 
and tlms the nutritive value of the latter increased without in- 
creasing the total quantity of liquid taken. A number of these 
preparations have been mentioned under the head of beef-juices 
and meat-powders. The various casein preparations, among 
which may be mentioned nutrose, eucasein, sanose, and plasmon, 
are artificial foods. 

1. Nutrose is prepared from the casein of milk combined 
with an alkali (sodium), which converts the casein into a color- 
less, tasteless powder completely soluble in water. It contains 
from 13 to 18 per cent, of nitrogen, and is used as a food in 
digestive disturbances. It is administered in soups (one-third 
to one-half ounce of nutrose to each cupful). 

2. ^^ucasein is a similar preparation, in which, however, 
ammonia enters instead of sodium. 

3. Sanose is a food containing 80 per cent, of ])ure casein 
and 20 per cent, of egg-albumin. It is a colorless powder. It 
emulsifies in water, forming a white liquid, and can be taken in 
cocoa, milk, or broth. 

4. Plasmon is prepared from the proteins of milk, and is a 
most useful casein product. It is a wliite tasteless powder, 
soluble in warm water. It is administered in water, milk, or 
broths. It contains about 70 per cent, of proteins. 

Artificial Proteins made from Meat. — A number of 
tliese prej)arations have already been described. To this class 
bcilong : 1. Pemmican. 2. Peptone-products. 3. Mosquera 
" Beef Meal.'' 4. Somato>e. 

1. Pemmican is pn^parcd by cutling meat into thin slices 
and allowing tliese to dry ; sugar aii<l dried iVuits arc added, 
the nutritive value of the meat being thereby increased. Forty 
parts of fat are added to oO parts of meat.^

2. Peptone=products. — Peptone-products are j>re(lig('ste(l 
protein foods. When given in large quantities tliey tc^nd to 
produce diarrhea, and are objectionable to many patients on 
account of their disagreeable taste. Among the pi-incipal i»ej>- 
tone-products manufactured may be mentioned Kcmmerich's, 
Koch's, Benger's, Savory & Moore's, Carnriek's, .Vrmour's 
Wine of Beef Peptone, and Panopej)ton.

3. Mosquera Beef Meal is prej)ared by partially digesting meat 
by means of a ferment obtained from pin<ja[)ple juice. Accord- 
ing to Chittenden, this product contains 90 per cent, of nulri- 
tive matter (13 per cent, of fat and 77 per cent, of protein). 
The proteins are mainly in the form of albumoses and j)ept()nes. 
This preparation has a very high nutritive value and mav l)e 
added to cocoa, milk, or broth. 

4. Somatose. — Somatose is a predigested meat consisting of 
albumoses. It is a yellowish powder, tasteless, odorless, and 
highly nutritious, and is usually well borne even in gastric 
disturbances. 

Artificial Proteins prepared from Vegetables. — 
The two principal forms of this class of foods arc^ as follows : 

1. Roborat. — This is a vegetable protein manu fact u red iVom 
rice, wheat, and maize. It is a fine, odorless, and tasteless flour, 
slightly soluble in water. It is well borne by the stomach, and 
is absorbed about as well as an animal albumin (up to i'o per 
cent.). It is free from nuclein and does not increase the excre- 
tion of uric acid. It may be added to any food, but ordinarily 
30 or 40 per cent, of it is mixed with Hour and baked. 

2. Legumin consists of the casein of the legumes, and is a 
highly nutritious protein food. 

3. Aleuronat is a brownish powder chiefly utilizcxl as a Ibod 
for diabetics. It contains 80 per cent, of protein. 

Artificial Proteins prepared from both Animal 
and Vegetable Foods. — Of this class, one product espe- 
cially must be named — /. c, Tropon. This is pre])ared mainly

from fish and vegetables, and as sold on the market appears as 
a brownish tasteless powder. It is eaten mixed with broths or 
gruels. 

ARTmCIAL PROPRIETARY FOODS. 

A large number of proprietary foods, designed as substitutes 
for milk for infants and invalids, are on the market. Infants 
fed upon such foods alone are apt to become rachitic. Some 
of these foods have little food-value, especially the amylaceous 
foods in which the starch has not been predigested. Many of 
these preparations contain too little fat and far too great a pro- 
portion of carbohydrates. According to Holt, " when children 
are fed upon foods lacking in fat the teeth come late, the bones 
are soft, the muscles flabby,'' while " children fed upon foods 
containing too much sugar are frequently very fat, but their flesh 
is very soft ; they walk late and they perspire readily about the 
head and neck.'' As Halliburton has recently pointed out,^ 
^' mere chemic analysis is no criterion of food-value, for the 
digestibility of the food is the all-important question. Investi- 
gations into the value of food-stuffs must be conducted and con- 
trolled both in vivo and in vitro — both in the body and in the 
test-tube. The results of test-tube experiments are of value, but 
the final test of food-stuifs must be made on animals, and prefer- 
ably on man. These experiments are both tedious and difficult, 
but there is a growing appreciation of their value and an in- 
creasing resort to their use." 

Hutchison^ divides proprietary foods into three classes : 
1. Foods prepared from cows* milk with various 
additions or alterations, and requiring only the addition of 
water to fit them for immediate use. To this class belong 
Malted Milk, Xestle's Food, Lactated Food, Carnrick's Food, 
Cereal Milk, AVyeth's Prepared Food, and Wampole's Milk 
Food. These foods are prepared from flour baked and mixed 
with milk or cream and then dried. By means of the malt 
w^hich is added the starches are converted into dextrin and mal- 
tose. The general composition of these foods is as f dlows :

2. Farinaceous foods prepared from cereals of 
which the starch has been partly or wholly con- 
verted into dextrin or sugar, and which require the; addi- 
tion of milk to lit them for use. To this class belong- Mellin's 
Food, Savory & Moore's Infant Food, and Bender's Food. 
These foods are prepared by mixing equal parts of wheat flour 
and barley malt with bran and ])otassium bicarbonate. The 
mixture is made into a jiaste with water, and kept at a warm 
temperature until the starch is converted into dextrin and 
maltose. As these foods are poor in fat, protein, and mineral 
matters, they are added to milk in order to render them more 
nutritious. 

3. Farinaceous Foods in which the Starch has not 
been Predigested. — To this class belong Ridge's Food, 
Neave's Food, Imperial Granum, and Robinson's Patent Bar- 
ley. These foods are poor in fat, protein, and mineral matters. 

Cereal gruels, frequently used in infant feeding, are m(~)st 
easily made from prepared flours. They are not always iden- 
tical in composition, but the following table, showing composition 
of gruels made from the Gereo Gompany gruel Hours, is instruc-

Other Proprietary Foods. — Crackers are prepared from 
flour, water or milk, and are baked into various forms. 
Bakinir-powder and soda, and fre(|iiently milk, butter, sugar, 
and flavorin(r extracts, are added. Crackers are, as a rule, 
easily diirested. 

Malt Extracts. — Malt extracts are manufactured by heating 
a solution of malted l)arley at a moderate temperature in vacuo.

COOKING OF FOODS. 

Saccharin. — Saccharin In small quantities (0.;> gram pur day or 
less) added to food is probably without any deleterious eliect. J Uu 
in quantities greater than this, and especially over 1 gram daily, it 
is injurious to the human body. Saccharin as a sweetening agent 
should only be used in diabetes or in other diseases in which .-ugar 
is injurious. It should not be added to foods for healthy indi- 
viduals. It should be borne in mind that saccharin has no food 
value. For full details concerning Saccharin, see IJeport Xo. 1*4, 
issued November 15, 1911, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 

The cooking of food is an art practised by all races, savage 
as well as civilized. Food is cooked to improve its llavor, to 
soften it so that it can be masticated and more easily digested, 
and finally to destroy all parasites and disease germs that may 
be present in the raw food. By cooking, certain flavors are 
developed, which by their savoriness increase the appetite and 
the taste for the food. Cooking, moreover, destroys the tough 
fibrous envelops that surround many foods, thus ])ermitting the 
food to be more easily acted upon by the various digestive 
fluids. Various parasitic organisms present in many f )ods are 
destroyed by cooking, and the food thus freed from one of its 
most dangerous elements. On cooking, the protein in food 
coagulates ; under the influence of dry beat the starches are 



ma 
ill 



202 VARIOUS FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING ON DIET, 

gradually converted iuto dextrin, whereas under the influence 
of moist heat the granules gradually swell until they rupture 
their envelops. Sugars, by boiling are changed gradually into 
caramel, wliich is the source of the odor frequently given oft' 
in the cooking of food. When fats are heated, they undergo a 
change, with the production of free fatty acids, which are often 
reponsible for the odors that exist in the kitchen. 

Cooking of Meat. — Boiling. — In cooking meats the tem- 
perature ol" the water should not exceed the temperature neces- 
ry tor the coagulation of the proteins. In order that the meat 

y retain as much of its flavor as possible it should be immersed 

b( tiling water f)r a few moments; in this way the protein 
en the surface immediately coagulates, thus preventing escape 
of the constituents and so retaining all the nutritive elements 
in the meat. After this has been accomplished the temperature 
(,'f the water may be lowered and the process of cooking con- 
tinui'd. The broth which is so produced is thin and poor. If 
a rich, nutritious broth is desired, the meat should be cut into 
small ])ieces and ])laced in cold water, and the temperature 
gradually increased to 150° F. In this way the nutritious 
elements of the meat pass out into the broth. 

Roasting. — In roasting, the meat is first exposed to a high 
temperature and afterward cooked slowly; thus the outer layers 
coagulate at once, preventing escape of the juices. Roasting 
not only ])revents eva])oration of the flavors of meats, but by 
its effect on the extractives develops savory odors and flavors. 

Fiaking. — Baking nuich resembles roasting, except that by 
the latter process the heat is applied all round the meat, in- 
stead of only to one side. 

Stewing. — For this jnirpose meat is cut into small pieces 
and placed in a small (juantity of water. The water is heated 
-lowly, but not allowed to boil ; a certain amount of the nutri- 
tious substances thus passes into the water, which then becomes 
rieh, and to which flavoring substances and vegetables are 
added. Inasmuch as the juicc^ is eaten with the meat, none of 
the nutritious ingredients is lost. 

Firazing. — In this ])rocess the meat is })laced in a small 
\e-<( I ;uid <-()ven'd with a strong li(jUor of vegetable and 
animal juicf's ; it is then heated, but not boiled. Tlie tough 
libel's of the meat an; thus loosened and made tender; the 
meat al-o becomes impregnat<'d with vegetables and spices 
pres<iit in the jiiiees, whicli enhances its flavor. 

Broiling. — Ihoilingand roasting are similar })r()ces.ses, except 
that in the former smaller portions are utilized ; the i)rocess is 



COOKING OF FOODS. 203 

thus more rapid, a large surface being exposed to the direct 
action of the heat. 

Frying. — In this process the meat is put into boiling fat, 
^vith which it becomes saturated ; fatty acids are thus pro- 
duced, which have a tendency to irritate the stomach and cause 
indigestion. 

Cooking of Pish. — Fish may be boiled, broiled, baked, 
and fried. Boiled fish is most easily digested. Inasmuch as 
the flavoring substances are more easily dissolved out into the 
water and lost, less time should be consumed in boiling fish 
than in boiling meat. Sir Henry Thompson has shown that 
even with careful boiling 5 per cent, of the solid matter of fish 
is apt to be lost ; for this reason steaming is often preferable. 

EFFECT OF COOKING. 

The e£Fect of cooking on meat is to diminish its watery 
constituents, thus concentrating and rendering it more nutritious ; 
by this process also the extractives, as well as some of the fats, 
are partly removed. 

Grindley and Majonnier have studied the effect of cooking 
meat very carefully. They have determined that the chief loss 
in weight during boiling, sauteing, and pan broiling is due to 
water removed by the heat of the cooking. In the roasting of 
meats the chief loss is due to the removal of both water and fat. 
In pan broiling tlie losses which take place are very small as 
compared with the other methods of cooking. When beef is 
cooked in water, from 3.25 to 12 percent, of the nitrogenous 
matter, 0.60 to 37 per cent, of the fat, and 20 to 67 per cent, of 
the mineral matter of the original uncooked meat may be found 
in the bn^th. This nutritive material is not lost in case the broth 
is utilized with the meat. In roasted meats from 0.2o to 4.55 
per cent, of nitrogenous matter, 4.5 to 57 per cent, of fat, and 
2.4 to 27 per cent, of mineral matter present in the uncooked 
meat may be found in the drippings. Beef which has been used 
in the preparation of beef-tea or broth has really lost but com- 
paratively little in nutritive value, although much of the flavor- 
ing matter has been removed. The longer time meat is cooked, 
and the higher temperature at which this is done, the greater the 
loss in water and fat, the larger pieces losing relatively less than 
the smaller ones. A point of considerable interest is that when 
meat is cooked in water at 80° to 85° C, placing the meat in hot 
or cold water at the start, has but little effect on the amount of 
material found in the broth.

Effect of Cooking- on Vegetables. — The important 
()\)]<'ct in tlic cnokiiiLr of vegetables is to rnptnre tlie cellulose 
envcloj) :in(l -o to soi'ten the contained starch-granules. Under 
the infiiicncc of heat and moisture the starch swells and bursts 
it- envelop, f(»rrniniz; a ])aste ; this paste, in its turn, expands 
:tn(l ruptures the cclhilose envelop; cooking, therefore, renders 
\('jclable foods more easily digestible. 

A- lia< been pointed out, in the cooking of meats a certain 
J. r. .portion of the ingredients is lost. Unlike meats, however,

deep, with an outer case of sheet iron. The sides and lid are 
lined with 2J inches of felt, and inside this, again, is a further 
lining of tin. Underneath this box, which will hold 30 gallons, 
are ])laced two of Fletcher's atmospheric gas-burners. The 
felt being a non-conductor, nearly all tlie heat from the gas is 
utilized, and a comparatively small expenditure of gas suffices 
to raise the temperature of the contents of the box to boiling- 
point, or to the heat required for the food which is being cooked. 

" When once the desired temperature is o})tained, one of the 
burners can be turned off and the other lowered, when, owing 
to the prevention of radiation by the felt, it will be found that 
a merely nominal expenditure of gas will enable the tempera- 
ture to be maintained for hours, and even when the gas is 
totally extinguished, many hours will elapse before food cooked 
will become cool. 

^^ But, except in the case of puddings which require rapid 
boiling, the cooking is done in an inner pan, which is ])laced 
inside the box, and which contains rather more tlian twenty 
gallons. The apparatus may be best described as a luiire AVar- 
ren's pot, with the additional advantage that the wliole of the 
inner pan is surrounded by warm water." 



DISEASES CAUSED BY ERRORS IN DIET AND 
BY VARIOUS FOOD-POISONS. 

Disease may be caused by taking too little or too much food, 
by a diet that is not well balanced, — that is, does not contain the 
combination of food-elements in correct })roportions, — and by 
other factors and influences the precise nature of many of 
which is obscure. It may also be caused by certain poisons 
or disease-germs or parasites taken into the body with the food 
or drink. Disease may occasionally be produced by a personal 
Ibod idiosyncrasy. It is also frequently caused by certain 
beverages. 

The diseases due to the takino- of insufficient food are starva- 
tion, malnutrition, niarasmus, and some forms of anemia. Chlo- 
rosis is apt to occur in underfed girls. 

Overeating, or the taking of improper food, gives rise to a 
great variety of diseases, especially in those who have heredi- 
tary tendencies to certain diseases. The food, by producing 
irritation in the alimentary tract, may be the direct cause of dis- 
ease, as in acute indigestion, diarrhea, and the like. Disease 
may also be produced by the excessive amounts of food assimi- 



206 VARIOUS FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING ON DIET. 

lated either being deposited as fat and causing obesity, or by 
overworking the organs of excretion, producing degenerations 
or scleroses. The kidneys, liver, and heart are the organs most 
likely to suffer, but the nervous system may also be affected. 
In epileptics attacks may be brought on by overfeeding. Gout, 
lithemia, and the like are among the diseases caused by a too 
generous diet. Diseases of the skin, such as acne, eczema, and 
urticaria, may also have the same causal factor. 

Overeating is probably as prolific a source of disease as over- 
drinking, a fact that is not generally admitted. The common- 
est effects of overdrinking are the nervous conditions caused by 
excessive tea- or coffee-drinking, and the all too familiar condi- 
tion, with its well-known symptomatol(»gy, of acute or chronic 
alcoholism. 

Acute food-poisoning is due to the action of ptomains, 
and is often known as ptomain-poisoning. Ptomains, or toxins, 
are poisonous substances caused by the action of l)acteria, and 
may be generated in nitrogenous foods or in the alimentary 
tract. They resemble alkaloids, and when absorbed are par- 
tially destroyed in the liver. 

Parasites in Food or Drink. — Quite a number of dis- 
eases are connuunicnted to man througli either the })arasite or 
its embryo being taken into the stomach with the f )od or in 
drinking-water. For a thorough knowledge of these ])arasites 
ajid their effects on the human system the student is referred to 
th<' text-books on bacteriology. 

The Amoeba coli, which causes a firm of chronic dvsenterv, 
is j)robably taken in with the drinking-water. Its lii'c-historv 
is not definitely known. 

Coccidium Oviforme. — The s})ores, known as ])soros])ermia, 
have been found in the liver, ])leura, and other organs of man. 
'Y\\i'.y })ro})ably gain entrance into the system from water, areen 
vegetal)les, or from handling animals sueli as dogs and rai)bits. 
'J'lie life-history of this organism is obscure. 

Trichomonas^ and cercomonas ai-e small ]»ara.-ites at times 
f )un(l in the stools. 

Distoma hepaticum, or liver fluke, usually infests the gall- 
duct or the gall-bladder. Tin; enibiyos are attached to a(|uatic 
])huits, and hence are believed to be laken in with them or with 
drinking-water. Several other .-jxcics are described as occur- 
ring in China and in I^g\pt. 

Bilharzia hasmatobia, or blood fluke, is found in the urine.

It is a native of Egypt, southern Africa, and Arabia. The 
embryos are probably taken into the body with drinking-water. 

Tapeworm. — Several species of ta})eworni have been described. 
The neck and head of this worm, called the scolex, may become 
encysted, and the worm is then known as the cysticercus. 

Tamia Solium. — The pork ta])eworm is a somewhat rare 
form, infection usually taking place by means of tlie embryos 
present in raw or underdone pork. The embryos are seen in 
the meat as small white spots, and, from its mottled aj)pearance, 
the meat containing them is usually called measly pork. Gov- 
ernment inspection of meat has done much to })revent infection 
by this and other forms of parasites. 

Tcrnia mediocaneUata or saghiata is the most common tape- 
worm in the United States. Infection is produced through eating 
raw or underdone beef. There are several other rare varieties : 

Twnla cucumerina or clUptica, a very small tapeworm, is 
found in the dog and occasionally in man. Its embryos occur 
in the dog louse. 

TcEKiia flavopunctata is a form found in Boston. 

Tcenia nana and madagascariensls are forms occasionally met 
with. 

Bothriocephalus latus is a tapeworm found in the north of 
Europe, but is occasionally imported into the United States. 
The larvse are found in fish. Two other forms, B. maritima 
and B. mystax, have been found in man. B. cordatun, seen in 
Greenland, and B. cristalus are other rare forms ; the former 
was found in an immature state in Iceland and the latter 
usually occurs in cats or dogs. 

Tcenia Echinococcus. — This is found in the intestines of dogs. 
In man it may form single or multilocular cysts. Infection 
occurs from handling dogs or from eating green vegetables. It 
is rare in America, but not uncommon in Europe. 

Ascaris lumbricoides, or round-worm, is a common parasite 
whose life-history is unknown. 

Oxyuris vermicularis, or pin-worm, a small parasite often 
found in children, is believed to be taken in with fruit and 
other raw food. 

Strongylus duodenale, also called Anchylostomum duo= 
denale, is a parasite attracting considerable attention in Amer- 
ica. Formerly but little known in the United States, numer- 
ous instances of infection by this parasite have recently been 
reported. It is a small parasite, from 6 to 10 millimeters long, 
and is present in the upper part of the intestine. It causes 
severe anemia. The embryos of the parasite are probably taken

ill with drinking-water. It is apt to occur in brick-makers, 
miners, and those following similar occupations. 

Filaria Sanguinis Hominis. — This parasite is found in the 
Southern States, and is probably also taken with impure water. 
It causes hematochyluria and certain forms of elephantiasis. 

Filaria or Dracunculus medinensis, or guinea-worm, de- 
velops in the cyclops, a small crustacean. Tiie liirviQ are prob- 
ably taken into the stomach with drinking-water. It causes 
vesicles and ulcers. Cases of infection that must have occurred 
in America have been described. 

Trichocephalus dispar, or whipworm, is found in the cecum, 
and is about 4 or o centimeters in length. It does not, as a 
rule, cause any symptoms. 

Rhabdonema intestinale is a small parasite often spoken of 
as the Cochin-China diarrhea worm. It is found in the intes- 
tines, and causes a form of tro])ical diarrhea. It has been 
discovered in many parts of the world. 

Parasitic Diseases. — Trichiniasis. — This is a disease 
caused by eating the so-called ^' measly '^ pork, or pork in- 
fected with TrichiiKi Hpiralh. This ])arasite measures 1.5 mil- 
limeters in length — the female, o to 3.5 millimeters, and the 
embryos from 0.5 to 1 millinietcr. The embrvos are o;enerallv 
coiled up and encapsulated, and are seen in the voluntary 
muscles, giying rise to the name mentioned above. The para- 
site is also found in the rat, and Dock l)elieves that the disease 
is communicated to the hog ])y eating inlected rats. 

When taken into the intestinal canal, the enveloj) surrounding 
the emi)ryo is dissolved, and in from three to six days the latter 
develops into a full-grown tricliina. The female produces the 
embryos by thousands, and these woi'k their way througli the 
intestinal wall and enter into the voluntai'v muscles, where they 
may be found several weeks after infection. If they are to be 
found at all, they are ])resent in the diaphragm, which, owing to 
its proximity to the intestinal canal, is the favorite site. In the 
mnsrlcs the parasites are snrroundcil by a zone of irritation, 
and filially become encaj)sulat<'d, lime salts being deposited in 
the capsule. Thus encapsulated, the })arasite may live for 
ycai's. its ])i'('S{!nce gi\'es rise to gastro-intestinal irritation, 
fever, pain, and prostration. There is frequently a picture 
sirinilating ty})hoid. \ mai'ked eosinoj)liilia is usually present, 
and the disease proves fatal in many cases. 

Owing to the greater frei^uency with which raw pork is eaten 
in (xermany, trichiniasis is commoner in that country than in 



DISEASES CAUSED BY EOOD-POISOSS. 201) 

the United States. A teni})eratiire of 140° F. kills the para- 
site, and the only sure way of preventint^ the disease is to cook 
all pork. Tlie presence of the parasite is easily detected, and 
in places where meat is inspected infected meat should be rejected 
by the Government inspector. Pickling and ('nrin<2; meat may, 
if the })ieces are thin, kill the parasites, but they may survive 
if the pieces of meat are lar<xe. 

Diseases froto. Milk. — Numerous diseases are transmitted 
through the agency of milk, the cow itself being diseased or 
subsequent contamination of the milk taking place. The cow 
may be suflPering from diseased udders or from some affect ion 
of the mammary gland. The organism most commouly present 
in infected milk is the streptococcus. Tubercle l)acilli may find 
their way into the milk from a diseased gland or udder. As a 
rule, it may be stated that if the disease, whatever it may be, 
is not in the mammary gland or in the udder, it is unlikely that 
the bacteria which gave rise to the disease will find their way 
into the milk. It should be borne in mind, however, that milk 
from a sick cow, even if it does not cause disease directly, is 
apt to be poor in quality, and is not desirable for food. 

Milk infection is most commonly the result of im])ure milk, 
made so by improper care and contamination with toxin- 
producing bacteria. The disease may be the result of toxins 
formed in the milk, or the bacteria themselves may be the cause 
of the disturbance. (For details as to the proper care of this 
food, see the section on Milk.) Sour milk or milk which is 
about to turn may cause gastric or intestinal disturbances in in- 
valids or children. 

Poisons Transmitted in Milk. — Poisonous substances taken 
in with the food of the animal or administered in sufficient quan- 
tities as remedies may be transmitted in the milk and cause 
symptoms in the consumer. This is not of very frequent oc- 
curence. Among the numerous drugs which have been reported 
as causing ])oisonous symptoms are : arsenic, lead, copper, mer- 
cury, tartar emetic, iodin, atropin, veratrum viride, strychnia, 
croton oil, and others. 

Tuberculosis. — Milk as a cause of tuberculosis has of late 
years been the subject of nuich discussion. This discussion was 
largely the result of a statement made by Koch, in 1901, that 
bovine tuberculosis could not be transmitted to man, and that 
the disease as found in man and in animals was due to two 
different organisms. This statement has not been borne out 
by facts, and it may with safety be stated that the disease in 
14 



210 VARIOJ^S FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING ON DIET. 

l)(/tli Mian and animals is due to the same organism^ although 
some dliferences in the disease and also in the organism as 
found in man and in animals exist. If* a cow has tuberculosis 
of the nuunmarv gland or of tlie udder, although the disease 
mav not he apparent to the naked eye, the milk will contain 
tnhcrcle bacilli. If the disease occurs elsewhere in the body, 
tubercle bacilli arc not apt to find their way into the milk. 
The tubercle bacillus, moreover, does not multiply in milk. 
Tubcrculo.-is mav be produced in man In^ the same bacillus that 
causes bovine tuberculosis. AMicre this has occurred, it has 
u>uallv b(.H'n the residt of accident, the disease following being 
of a local nature and of no great intensity. With what degree 
f)l" i'rc(|uencv the tubercle bacillus is found in milk, and whether 
it has ever caused tuberculosis from the use of milk containing 
it, are (| nest ions that can not be definitely answered at this time. 

Diarrheal Diseases. — The question of diarrheal: diseases as 
caused by milk is of the greatest ])ractical importance. Diarrheal 
di-ease is commonest in the warm months, and 97 per cent, of 
tfie e:ises that occur in children are in l)ottle-fed babies. AVhere 
the milk is })ure and where proper care has been observed in 
transmission from the cow to consumer, the disease is rare. 
^\'h(M•e the milk is impure and is carelessly handled, many cases 
of" diarrhea and death an^ tlie result. These diseases may be ])ro- 
dueed by toxins generated in the milk by the bacteria, or by 
the bacteria themselves being introduced into the intestinal 
tract. It is not definitely known just what l)acteria give rise to 
Munnier diarrhea. The disease is probably due to different 
organisms, llecent investigations ])oint to lUidlluH dysenteric us 
(ShiLfa) a- the organism most commonly j)resent. There is no 
LH-eater les-on to be learned in the wlK)le range of milk infections 
than that 'nnjuire null: causes (liarrlied. 

Diphtheria. — ])Iphthei-ia bacilli may find their way into milk 
iroin the milker, who may have the disease in a mild form, or 
rr(»m sub-e(pient contamination. A number of epidemics have 
owc.l I heir origin to infected milk. 

Scarlet Tever. — W'heix^ epidemics of this disease have 
occurred a-; the re-uli of milk infection, ihcy have usually 
been traced to a case of the di-ea-e in a milker's famllv. Kobcr

actiiio; an nurses, 10; milk stored in or near tlie siek-rooni, 3; 
infected cloth used in wipinij^ cans, 1. In l!l instances the in- 
fection was attributed to intlanunation of the udder or to ])uer- 
peral fever in tlie cow. These outbreaks should l)e reoard(;d as 
cases of streptococcus or sta})hylo(;occus infection rather tlian 
scarlet fever. 

Typhoid Fever. — Many e})Idemics of typhoid fever may he 
traced to an infected milk supply. Too much stress can not he 
laid on the importance of investiii^ating dairy farms as a sour(;e 
of typhoid fever epidemics. Kober tabulated 11)5 epidemic's 
caused by milk. In G7 instances the milk was ])robably infect- 
ed bv usino; infected well-water to wash the utensils, and in IG 
of these, infected water had been intentionally added to the 
milk for purposes of dilution. In 7 instances the infection was 
attributed to cows wading in sewage-polluted water or pastures ; 
in 24 instances the dairy employees acted as nurses ; in 10 in- 
stances patients suffering with mild attacks contijiued at work ; 
in 1 instance the milk-cans were washed with the dishcloth used 
among the fever patients ; in 2 instances dairy em})loyees were 
connected with the night soil service ; and in 2 instances the 
milk had been kept in a closet in the sick-room. 

Asiatic Cholera. — This disease may be transmitted throucrh 
the ao:encv of milk, but the usual mode of infection is throuo:h 
drinking-water. 

Milk-poisoning (Galactotoxismus). — In 1885 tyrotoxicon 
was found in milk, and in 1886 Newton and Wallace reported 
interesting series of cases of poisoning due to the presence of 
this toxin In milk. The milk was obtained from a dairy in 
which the mllkino^ was done at mIdnio;ht and at noon. The 
noon milk was the one that was poisonous. While still warm 
it was placed in cans, and delivered to the consumers in the 
heat of the day. The heat permitted the growth of bacteria 
which caused the formation of toxin. There have been numer- 
ous instances where its presence in milk has caused poisoning. 

Vaughan and Novy have also found it in ice-cream and in 
custard. Shearer has demonstrated Its presence in vanilla and 
lemon ices. Besides tyrotoxicon, other toxins have been found 
in milk. Vaughan and Perkins have isolated a toxin, caused 
by a colon-like bacillus, which produces marked symptoms. 

Cheese-poisoning (Tyrotoxismus). — As early as 
1827 theories began to be disseminated as to the reason why 
some cheese, usually apparently unaltered so I'ar as ordinary 
observation wxnt, should cause poisoning. Himnefeld and 



212 VARIOUS FACTORS IN THEIR REARING ON DIET. 

others after him believed it to be due to the fatty acids. 
Numerous cases were reported and discussed. In 1883 and 
1884 about 300 cases of cheese-poisoning were reported to the 
Michigan State Board of Health. All who ate of the cheese 
were attiicked, and the symptoms varied with the quantity 
taken, being more severe where large amounts had been in- 
gested. The symptoms were vomiting and purging, with watery 
stools ; the tongue, at hrst white, then became red and very 
dry, and there was pain in the region of the stomach. The 
pulse was feeble and irregular, and in some instances there was 
cyanosis. A'aughan studied these cases, and found that the 
poisoning was due to twelve different varieties of cheese, most 
of which came from one factory. The cheese seemed to differ 
but little from ordinary good clieese, but if offered to cats or 
dogs together with good clieese, the animals invariably chose 
the good. If fed to hungry cats, they would eat it and appar- 
ently with no ill effects. The poison was isolated, and con- 
sisted of a crystalline, highly poisonous substance, which 
Vaughan called tyrotoxicon. Tyrotoxicon, however, appears 
to Ijc a comparatively rare poison, and other toxic substances 
have been discovered in cheese. Vaughan isolated an albu- 
mose ; Vatighan and Perkins, two bacilli ; and Vaughan and 
McClymonds, a bacillus of the colon group, all of which were 
toxic. 

Typhoid Fever and Oysters. — Typhoid fever has been 
transmitted by infected oysters, the oysters having usually been 
grown very near the outlet of a sewer or on artificial l)eds. In 
Kew Haven, some years ago, thirty students were infected with 
typhoid by eating raw oysters supplied by a dealer who made a 
practice of placing the fresh oysters in the river for a day or two 
after receiving them. Kunning from his house to the river, 
near where he had ])laced the oysters, was a drain-pi})e. His 
daughter had typhoid at the time, and his wife had died of tlie 
disease shortly before. Instances have been re])orted in other, 
countries, but it is not a very common mode of infection. 

Poison from Mussels (Mytilotoxismus). — Accord- 
ing to A'aughan and Novy, there are three kinds of mussel- 
poisoning : 

1. Where the principal symptoms are gastro-intestinal, and 
of varying" intensity. This form may at times be choleriform 
(Combe). Death may follow very rapidly — in Combe's case it 
occurred in two days. 

2. The most fre(juent form is that in wfiich symptoms are 



DISEASES CAUSED BY EOOD- POISONS. 2\:\ 

priiicij)ally nervous, coining on shortly al'ter the nnisscls are 
eaten. There is a sensation of heat and iteliing ; a rash of an 
nrtiearial nature, and sometimes vesieulai*, a})j)ears. 'I'here may 
be dyspnea, and death may result irom convulsive tremors or 
coma. J)eath has followed from this iorm in thi'ce days. 

:\. In the third form the symptoms are those of an intoxica- 
tion I'esembling alcoholism followed by ])aralysis and death. 
Combe in 1<S27, reported death as early as three hours after 
eating the nuissels, and others six or seven hours, and still others 
after longer intervals. 

Various theories have been advanced to explain the cause of 
mussel-poisoning. Brieger has isolated a toxin from mussels 
which he calls mytilotoxin, Avhich caused a fatal case of poison- 
ing. Further study is needed to decide the question of the 
toxin ]irinciple in the other forms. 

Shell-fish taken from filthy water is i\\)t to be poisonous. At 
Havre, France, cases of poisoning occurred from the eating of 
oysters taken from near the outlet of a drain from a public 
water-closet (Pasquier). Various rules for recognizing poison- 
ous shell-fish have been given, but they are not, as a rule, reli- 
able. Shell-fish that is fresh, that has been taken from clean 
water, and that has been washed with clean water, is generally 
safe. Kept at a summer temperature, whether cooked or not, 
it is unfit for food. 

Poisoning due to Fish (Ichthyotoxismus). — Fish 
may be poisonous under various conditions : 

(1) Some are ahvays ])oisonous. (2) Some are })oisonous 
during the spawning season. (3) Some may be infected with 
bacterial diseases which may cause disease in man. (4) Like 
other nitrogenous foods, fish may be infected with bacteria 
which produce toxins. 

Ko])ert, according to Xovy and Vaughan, makes the follow- 
ing classification of ])oisonous fish : 

1. Where the fish are supplied with ]K)ison glands coimected 
with barbed fins, with which they wound their enemies, like the 
poison of snakes. These cause prostration, convulsions, and death 
in man. 

2. The genus Tetrodon, a Japanese fish which has poisonous 
ovaries, which are less poisonous in winter, when tlie ovaries 
are inactive. Kakke, a disease of Japan and other Eastern 
countries, is believed to be due to the eating of certain varieties 
of the Scomhridcc family. (See Beriberi.) 

3. Certain other fish whose flesh and glands are harmless 
may be dangerous on account of the deconqiosing substances 
or corals, etc., on which they feed. 



214 VARIOUS FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING ON DIET. 

4. Poisoning due to })tomains, of which Anrep has isolated 
two. These are due to the fish being infected with saprophytic 
bacteria. The syraj^toms are principally due to involvement 
of the gastro-intestinal tract and nervous system — nausea, 
vomiting, diarrliea, prostration, rashes, etc. 

In Russia and Germany there are certain fish that, if eaten 
raw, may produce disease, but that, when thoroughly cooked, 
are harmless. The cause is })robably found in a bacterial dis- 
ease of the fish. 

Meat-poisoning (Kreotoxismus). — Many forms of 
meat-poisoning have been described, and some have been given 
special names. Certain diseases the result of direct transmis- 
sion will be considered separately. Tlie meat of animals that 
have died of disease of any kind is unfit for food, and the old 
Mosaic law, " Ye sliall not eat anything that dieth of itself," ^ 
is a good hycfienic rule. The Jewish laws concerning what 
were regarded as clean and unclean meats are set forth in the 
fourteenth chapter of the book of Deuteronomy. 

Poisoning has followed the ingestion of meats of various 
kinds in which toxic substances had formed. Some meats 
undergo changes that can he detected by ordinary means, while 
in still others putrefactive changes are not ap[)arent. Tlie 
poisons vary in nature, and in some cases toxins and bacteria 
have been isolated. Among the many foods that have caused 
meat-poisoning may be mentioned canned meats — pigs' tongues, 
potted chicken, and the like ; ham, sausage, brawn, veal and 
pork pies, ribs of beef, goose-grease — in fact, almost every kind 
and form of meat fi)ods. 

Sausage-poisoning, known as ])otulismus or allantiasis, has 
been known f)r over a hundred years. It is l^ecoming less 
frecjuent as the causes that give rise to the disease are becoming 
})etter known to sausage-makers. In Baden, (Tcrmany, where 
very faulty methods of preparing and curing sausage were in 
vogue, tlie disease was formerly frecjucnt. ]>lood that had 
become decom})osed was often used, and in otlu'r instances the 
sausage was im|)erfectly cured, the outside being smoked an<l 
rendered harndess, the center remaining soft and highly poison- 
ous. For this re;ison those who ate the outside of the sausage 
(exhibited no ill eileets, while those who ])artook of the centin' 
were made verv ill and many died. The symptoms vary with 
the kind of j)oison that has (levelo])ed in the meat, but there 
are no characteristic lesions in those who die.

DISEASES CAUSED BY FOOD-POISONS. 215 

^'Von Faber, ill 1821, observed sixteen persons wlio were 
made siek by eating fresh unsnioked sausage made from the 
tiesh of a pig wliich had suffered from an abscess on its neek. 
Five of the patients died. The symptoms were as IbUows : 
There were constrietion of the throat and dilfienlty in swal- 
lowing, retching, vomiting, eolie-like pains, vt'rtigo, hoarseness, 
dimness of vision, and headaehe. J^ater on, in severe eases, 
there was complete exhaustion, and, linally, paralysis. TIk; 
eyeballs were retracted, the pupils w^ere sometimes dilated and 
tlien contracted, and th(;y did not res])ond t(j light ; there was 
paralysis of the upper lids. The tonsils were swollen, but n(jt 
as in tonsillitis. Liquids which w^re not irritating could be 
carried as far as the esophagus, when they were rejected from 
the mouth and nose with coughing. Solid lV)od could not be 
swallowed. On the back of the tongue and in the ])harynx 
there Avas observed a puriform exudate. Obstinate constipation 
existed in all, while the sphincter ani was paralyzed. Breathing 
was easy, but all had a croupous cough. The skin was dry 
and there was incontinence of urine. There was no delirium, 
and the mind remained clear to the last." ^ 

Schiiz cites cases of poisoning caused by eating liver sausage. 
There Avere loss of voice, typhoid-like stools, marked /lellrium, 
and mental disturbance that persisted for weeks afterward. 
The onset occurred in from eighteen to twenty-four hours after 
eating the sausage, and lasted from one to four weeks. There 
were no deaths. 

Tripe has re})orted over 60 cases where then^ were frequent 
stools, Aveak and rapid heart, and delirium. The pupils were 
usually contracted but reacted to light. 

Ballard reported 490 deaths due to ]Hieumonia, caused in 
most of the cases by eating Infected bacon. According to this 
observer, those who had the disease could transmit it to others 
who had not eaten of the meat, a fact that has been noted in 
many other instances. After having been kept several months 
the bacon lost its toxicity. This epidemic was known as the 
Middlesborough pneumonia e])idemic. 

Another interesting epidemic of meat-poisoning occurred at 
Middleburg, Holland. Meat from a cow siek with ])uerperal 
fever Avas eaten by 256 soldiers and 36 citizens, the symptoms 
consisting of vomiting, purging, dizziness, sleeplessness, dilata- 
tion of the pupils, and in some cases an eczematous eruption. 
There were no fatalities.

216 VARIOUS FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING ON DIET, 

Gartner found Bdcillus enferiditis in some instances of meat- 
poisoning, and others have also demonstrated its presence. 
Vaughan and Perkins isolated two bacteria — a bacillus and a 
streptococcus — from pressed chicken that poisoned a large num- 
ber of j)ersons at Sturgis, Michigan. Gaflf'ky and Paak have iso- 
lated a bacillus resembling the colon-bacillus. Van Ermengem 
discovered a bacillus similar to that found in other outbreaks ; 
it Avas present in meat that, a})parently, had not undergone 
putrefactive changes ; 34 persons were affected and 3 died. 
The symptoms consisted of delirium, fever, ])ain in the abdomen 
and head, and })rostration. Kllezelles, of J^elgium, found an 
organism in ham that a[)]X'ared, fresh, but that had ])roduccd 
jioisoning in some with fatal results. The })atients had marked 
nervous sym])toms, consisting of diplo])ia, mydriasis, ptosis, 
aphasia, aphonia, and anuria. Other ])ortioi]s of the pig were 
eaten without causing any ill effects, 'i'he ham had been cured 
in brine, while the other })art of the pig had not. An anaerobic 
organism was searched for and found, and this was named 
lUiL'llluH botu/iyiiu/s. It is as virulent as the tetanus bacillus. 

OTHER FORMS OF FOOD-POISONING. 

Mushroom-poisoning. — Poisonous fungi are often mis- 
taken for edible mushrooms, and lead to toxic symptoms. If 
there is a ring about the stalk and the mushroom ])eel (lasily 
and has pink gills, it is said to be non-])oisonous. This rule is 
not a safe one, since some of the most dangerous forms of 
fungi answer to this description. The active ])rinciple in these 
])oisonous fungi is iiiUscarin or some allied alkahjid. The 
symptoms ])rodu('ed ai'c vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, and great 
})rostration. Tlie pu])ils are contracted, and in children there 
mav be convulsions. The treatment consists in em])tying the 
stomach and bowels as ])rom])tly as ])ossible, and in giving 
atropin and other restoratives. 

Grain-poisoning". — There arc tlirce ibi'ins of grain-poison- 
ing, generally described as ergoli>m, ])ellagra, and lathyri>m. 
'i'lny are diseases seen almost exchisixcly among the s(|Uali(l 
and destitute, the effects being due to in-ullicient noni-ishment 
c(»ml>iiied in ciicli ca>e with the specific poison from the grain. 
Most cases and cj)i(lemics ha\'e occurred among the ])overty- 
strickcn l^uropcan peasants. 'Hie well-to-do and ])i*operly

interesting. It is very pr()l)al)le that many cases of "St. 
Antliony's fire," deserihed in the twell'th cciitni-y and latci-, 
were eases of grain-])oisoning. Jt is also j)rol)al)l(' that syphilis 
and varions forms of nleers and .<j:;anor('n(' wcrr confonndcd with 
it and with one another. It is not within the pi'ovincc of this 
hook to describe the horrible epidemics of the middh' aLzc-, with 
their wake of nnitilatlons and nuscry. Within recent years 
epidemics luive ocenrred in Jvnssia. 

Thnillier was the iirst to discover tliat the canse of the dis- 
ease existed in s])urred rye. Jle also ])ointed ont that the r\-e 
is s])nrre(l in the damp, cohl seasons, an<l that the deui'ce *A' 
virnlenee de])ends U])on the amount of the poison taken. He 
])roved his theories by animal experimentation. Dodart, in 
1676, ascertained that ergot was most active when fre.-h, and 
that it loses in virulence as it ages. It is produced by a mi- 
croscopic parasite, known as Clariceps jjnrpui-cd, growiuLi' (.n 
the rye. The disease is caused by eating the grain on wiiicli 
the parasite has grown. According to Kobert, ergot contains 
two poisons, sphacelinlc acid, which causes gangrene, and cornu- 
tin, wliich provokes the anesthesia and convulsions. The sus- 
ceptibility of different individuals varies greatly. There are 
two forms of the disease, one in which gangrene is the promi- 
nent feature, and a second in which there are convulsions and 
anesthesia. An acute and a chronic form of tlie disease occur. 
In the gangrenous form there are, at first, tingling, anesthesia, 
s])asmodic movements, and later blood-stiisis, followed by gari- 
grene of the extremities. In the convulsive form there are 
prodromal symptoms, lasting for a Aveek or ten days, consisting 
of headache, weakness, and tingling sensations. ]^^)]lowing 
these there are cramps in the muscles and conNul-ions. 'I'he 
spasms may last for hours or days, and are apt to recur. M(mi- 
tal disturbances and symptoms of cord involvement may sujum- 
vene. The disease should not be mistaken for crythi-omelalgia, 
Kaynaud's disease, or acrodynia, Avhose sym])toms it sinndaies. 

According to Bottger, ergot may be detected in tlour by mix- 
ing a small quantity with ether and adding a lew crystals of 
oxalic acid. The mixture is then boiled and allowed to settle and 
clear. If ergot is ])resent, a red tinge will be im})arted to the iluid. 

Lathyrism (Lupinosis). — This is a milder form of grain- 
poisoning, the poisonous agent being the seed of L<it/ii//-us 
scitivus and L. c/cc/y/, commonly known as the chick-pea. Poi- 
soning occurs from the meal groimd from these seeds, which has 
been used to adulterate flour. The disease was noted as earlv 



218 VARIOUS FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING ON DIET. 

as tlie seventeenth century, and was studied by James Irving iu 
India. As the result of the failure of the wheat crop at Alla- 
habad the inhabitants used the chick-pea for food, and an epi- 
(hnnic of lathryism followed. The disease affects the legs, 
])ro(hicing a stiffness of the joints, and may cause a spastic 
paraplegia. 

Pellagra (Maidismus). — This is also a disease of extreme 
poverty and misery, and has been seen principally iu Italy, 
France, S})ain, and Koumania. The past few years has seen 
an enormous increase in the amount of pellagra in the United 
States, and the disease has been restudied both in this country 
and abroad. It was formerly taught that the disease was due 
to the use of s]X)iled maize. This theory was generally accepted 
until a few years ago. It has recently been questioned, and 
Saml^on believes the disease is transmissible, and that it is 
spread by a two-winged fly of the genus Similium. We cannot 
go into this question, which is at })resent unsettled, but the dis- 
ease may still be placed with those which have some connection 
with food. At the present time it is impossil)le to state whether 
the f >od is the direct causative agent or not, or only acts indi- 
rectly. The exact nature of the changes in the grain are not 
fully understood. The early symptoms arc indefinite weakness, 
pains, and digestive disturbances. The skin is usually affected, 
hence the name pellagra (jjeliis agra — /. f., rough skin). An 
erythema, with swelling and ]X'techia', appears. Bulkc are fre- 
quent, and when they break they leave ulcers. The skin symp- 
toms disap[)ear, but a pigmented skin remains. After several 
months tlie symptoms subside, usually to recur the following 
spring. In the; severer cases there may be ])ronounce(l nervous 
symj^toms, such as convulsions, cram|>s, headaches, and even 
paralysis and mental disturbance. The last do not generally 
come on until the disease has been ])resent for several years. 
Manv of the cases in the insane asylums in various ])arts of 
Italy are cases of ])ellagra, usually with either melanciiolia or a 
suicidal mania. In this stage tin; condition is hopeless. 

Potato=poisoning. — Potatoes contain small amounts of an 
alkaloid, solanin, and sprouting potatoes or tiiose which have 
been partiallv ex])o-ed above ground may contain sufficient to 
{)ro(hic(* serious svmptoms, sucli as ])ain, vomiting, diarrhea, 
jaundice, and great prostration. 

Phosphorus-poisoning". — It has Ikmmi reconnncMided that, 
after acute ])hosphorus-poi>oning all tat be excluded from the 
diet, on th(3 j)rinciple tliat fat will dissolve any phos])horus 



DISEASES CAUSED BY EOOD-POISONS. 219 

remaining in the stomacli and so liastc^n its absorption. l''"r 
this reason the articles exchided sliouhl he not only the huttei- 
and other fats, bnt even milk and the yolks of e<ius. The diet 
shonld consist chiefly of cereals, gruels, and tli<' like. After 
several days the ordinary diet may gi-adiially Ix' resnm("<l. 

In chronic })hos})horiis-|)()isoning Magitot, of Paris, re('<)!n- 
meuds an ex(;lnsive milk diet, combined with the inhalation of 
oxygen, gentle exercise, and repeated small doses of tin-pentiiie. 
If suppuration has occurred, a sup])()rting (bet of th<' mo<t 
nutritious character, similar to that used for other su})pin'ative' 
conditions, should be prescribed. 

Beriberi or Kakke. — According to ^lanson, up to l-Ss;', 
over one-fourth of the entire muster of Japanese sailors were 
affected with beriberi. In 188-^ there were \'1'M) eases among 
5349 men. In 1884 more nitrogenous food was added 
to the diet, and the following year only 41 cases were re- 
ported. In 1887 the disease had practically disappeared from 
the Japanese Navy. In various institutions throughout the 
East, where beriberi prevails, the disease has been controlled 
by reducing the rice and adding meat and vegetables to the diet. 
Foster, Aron, and others have shown that the disease could be 
produced ex})erimentally by using a diet consisting largely of 
rice from which the outer portion or })eriearp had been re- 
moved. Such rice is usually called polished rice. In fowls 
such a diet causes a form of polyneuritis. It is possible to 
determine the amoimt of polishing it has undergone by labora- 
tory work, the method used being to estimate the ])ercentage of 
phosphorus. Un])olished or slightly ])olished rice has been 
found to contain 0.5 to 0.75 per cent, of phosphorus pentoxid. 

As a means of prev^ention, the prohibiticni of the use ot' pol- 
ished rice containing less than 0.4 per cent, of ])hosphoi'u> 
pentoid has been suggested. An attem])t to do this on a large 
scale wnll doubtless be tried in the Philippines by taxing the 
polished rice. As a means of cure Aron has suggestiHi the 
use of 15 grams of rice polishings mixed w\\\\ milk and sugar 
and given twice daily. This, Heiser stat(\<, cures ordinary 
cases in from two to four weeks. Tlu^ (piestion of tlu^ causation 
and prevention of beriberi will doubtless be settled beyond 
question in a few years. 

Actinomycosis. — This disease is comparatively rare in 
America. There is no evidence to show tluit it has ever been 
transmitted by articles of diet, but cases are recorded where th( 
infection has been traced to barlev-sheaths, to ij^rain chewed 



220 VARfOrs FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING ON DIET. 

raw, and to straw Ix'ing carried in the moutli. Tlie mammary 
(fland, both in cows and in women, may be infected, but so far 
no case lias l)een traced directly to milk. 

Foot-and-ttiouth Disease. — This disease may be trans- 
mitted from infected cattle by means of milk or butter made 
from the niilk of cows suffering from the disease, as well as by 
direct contact with the animals. The disease was studied as 
earlv as 1 S.">4, when three German veterinary surgeons drank 
the milk iVom infected cows. ^Vll develo]X'd the disease. In- 
{\\u\< and children have also l)een infected by drinking con- 
taminated milk. Tlie contagious ]>rinci])le is destroyed by heat, 
l)Ut tin' flesh, milk, and milk-])rodu(»ts of animals witli foot- 
and-mouth disease should not be used for food. During ejii- 
d( mics especial can.' shoidd be taken to avoid the ]>roducts of 
.-iicli animals, and in case of douljt the milk should be boiled 
before u-ing. 

Hydatid Disease. — Hydatid cysts, caused ])y the eggs 
of T<nu(f (chiitococcus, may also be classed with the diseases 
c:uised by diet. Tlu^ jiarasite grows in the small intestine of 
dogs, and the ova are taken into the alimentary canal of man 
by drinking Mater c<»iitaiuing them, by handling dogs and 
carrviiii;' the infected hands to the mouth, and bv eating; raw 
gi'ccii x'egetables. The disease is rare in America. In the 
iiicdicjil \var<ls of the N^ieima hosj^itals a routine question is, 
'• J)o you kecj) dogs, and do you eat green salads?'^

FOOD ADULTERATION, 

The adulteration of f xxl is a suhjcH't of such w ide scope that 
it can not be entered into lu^re in detail.' The subject is one of" 
the greatest importance to the comnuuiity at lai-ee ; and w hei-e 
legal restrictions do not exist, laws should be (uactcfl which will 
insure the proper inspection and regulation of tiie sale ot" all 
food-stnifs. The sale of injurious articles should be absolutely 
prohibited, and adulterated but non-injurious commodities should 
be properly branded so that the purchaser may not be compelled 
to pay an exorbitant price for an inferior article. The law- 
should apply to both native and imported food-stulls. 

In the United States the law enacted July 1, 1;m):J, ])rohil)its 
the introduction of — (a) foods containing substances deletei-ious 
to health ; (J)) those misbranded ; and (c) foods the sale (»f which 
is })rohibited in the country from which they are shipjx'd. 

Almost all the States have enacted food laws of" more or less 
efficiency, but the laws should be sufliciently uniform and 
stringent to prevent the sale of food-stuff's delet<.>rious to health, 
and to prevent misbranding. Although under the present law 
im})orted articles are pure and ])roperly branded, tluM-e are great 
0})portunities, after the articles have entered the country, t"or the 
perpetration of fraud; the same is tme of native food-stufls. 

Food adulteration is of two kinds : that which is injurious 
and that which is non-injuriou.-. The latter is p!'aetl.-e<i where 
there are no fixed standards, or, where such do exist, in debase- 
ments from these fixed standards. Adulterations may be clas- 
sified as follows : 

1. Conventional — to suit the taste and deman<l- of the public. 
Such adulterations are usually effected by means of coloring- 

^ For an extended study of tliis subject the reader is ivferred to r>!yiirs 
book on Foods, and also to tlie exeellent bulletins of t'le Division of Cheinistrv 
of the United States Department of Agriculture. Tlie bulletin on Food 
Adulteration, known as No. 13, of whieh some ti-n parts have already been 
issued, can be tound \n all the larij^er libraries, Init, unf'ortuuately, the earlier 
parts are out of print. It is to be hoped that this ItuUetin will be reprinted at 
an early date.

matters, many of which are harmful, and by bleaching certain 
products. 

2. Acc'xlrntaJ or incidental — arisino; from environment, care- 
lessness, or incompetency on the ])art of the producer, manu- 
facturer, or his aiients. This nsually consists in an admixture 
of Some ftreii^ii substance, such as husks, stems, leaves, etc. 

)>. uirhifnf)'}/ — to c(^mply with or take advantage of certain 
fixed nrbitrary standards. 

4. Iiifnttionnl — for })urposes of gain and competition. 

Coloring-matters. — The use of cok)ring-matter in food is 
a ninot point. \\c think we can safely assert that the use of 
anv artilieial coloring-matter is objectionable, and many of tlie 
dvcs so used are harmful. Forttniately, tlie peo])k' are being 
echieated by Wiley and his associates, and a demand lor pure 
and uncolored foods is being created. 

Alcoholic beverages are frequently adulterated. AVood 
or methvl alcohol is sometimes substituted for grain or ethyl 
alcohol. This is especially true of the flavoring extracts, which 
are used in small cpiantitics. Wood alcohol is an exceedingly 
dangei'ous adulterant. Blindness and even death have followed 
its use. The higher they stand in the series, the more toxic 
the alcoliols become. Himt has shown that a laro:er sino;le dose 
of methyl alcohol than of ethyl alcohol is requiix^I to kill, l)ut 
that the alcohols differ widely as regards their effects with con- 
tinued use. A quantity of ethyl alcohol somewhat below the 
lethal do-e may })e taken day after day without causing death, 
whereas repeated large doses of methyl alcohol may speedily 
result in death, the reason being that the end-])r()ducts of grain 
alcohol are acetic acid and water, wdiereas the end-])roducts of 
wood alcohol are formi(; acid and water. 

Adulterated alcoholic li(jUois contain fusel oil, tannin, log- 
wood, waiei-, coloring-mattei', and burnt sugar. A^arious grades 
ol* cheap whiskv and brandy are manufictured by unscrupidous 
rectitiei's bv mlxiuL'" newlv made alc()hol with colorinjx and 
tlax'oriiig matters. An imitation of gin is fVecpiently made 
iVoni {'heap .-pirit-, turpentine, sugar, and water. 

The Adulteration of Beer, Wine, etc. — Wine and beer are 
-ophi-ticate<l by the addition of various substances tisually 
;i(l(l.(l :i- pre-er\atives. ( 'hief among these is salicylic acid, 
\\hi<'h is a<l<le<l to arre.-t the action of ferments. Its use is 
foi-biddcii in 1'' ranee and (iermany, although in the latter 
countrv it nia\- l)e added to be<'r>^ that arc to be exported. 

(Jerar<l found that, in a liter, wine contained l.t'o, l.fJO, 1.48, 



FO 1) A I) UL TKUA TfO X. 223 

1.41, 1.35, ().<S1, niul III one case as much as o.-") grams ot" 
wilicvlic acid ; syrup contained in the same (|uantitv, 0. .">()-] .r>0 
grams; beer, 0.25-1.25 grams; milk, ().25-l.S5 gi-ams. In 
one case it Avill be noted that a liter of wine contained a I'ull 
twenty-four hours' dose of salicylic acid. 

Crampton found salicylic acid in about one-lhird oC iIh' sam- 
])les of American bottled beer which he examined. He did not 
tind any indraft beer. Sul])hurous acid is one oC the olde-t oi" 
])reservatives. Its use is forl)idden in both h'l'ance and (ier- 
niany. Borax is frequently used, and is also foi-bidden in the 
countries mentioned. Sodium bicarbonate is u^i^d in In-er to 
correct tlie acidity caused by im})roj)er brewing, and also to 
cause an increase in the carbonic acid content, so that the beer 
will have a better " bead." 

Wine is adulterated by adding sugar, gummy sub.-tance-, 
coloring-matters, and salicylic acid and mineral acids as ])re- 
servatives. In France wine is frequently jjldxfcrcd by the 
addition of gypsum, or calcium sulphate. As Crampton says : 
"The sul])hnric acid of the lime sjilts replaces the tartaric acid 
which is combined w^ith potash, and forms an acid sul])hate of 
potash, while the tartaric acid separates out as a tartrate oi' 
lime." This gives the w^ine a brighter color, clears it, and 
makes it keep better. 

Adulterated beer may contain burnt sugar, licorice, treacle, 
quassia, coriander, caraway seed, Cayenne pep))er, soda, sali- 
cylic acid, salt, carbonic acid (artilicially introduced), grains 
other than barley, glycerin, glucose, water (added by retailer), 
tobacco, and Cocculus indicus. 

Cider is frefjuently adulterated by the addition of water and 
preservatives, and is also manufactured artilicially. 

Many of the liquid malt cvfracts are merely beers, and most 
of them have little or no diastasic action ; tiny have no special 
food- value, nor do such extracts aid digestion. Some are adul- 
terated and harmful. 

Liqueurs are frequently adulterated :md imitated, and may 
contain injurious coloring-matter. jMaraschino and cremc de 
meuthe cherries may be colored with anilin dyes, and they 
sometimes contain an astonishing amount of coloring-matter. 

Tea. — Under the present law teas imported into the United 
States are practically free from adulteration. JMany inferior 
teas are sold, however, and their sale is not restricted. Tea 
may be adulterated by mixing exhausted or ibreigu leaves with 
it, and adding coloring-matter and astringents. '' Facing " is

sometimes ])raetised, aud consists of treating the leaves with 
phimbago, indigo, or Prussian bhie, the object being to make 
an inferior tea I'cseinble a better ])rodnct. The small amount 
of the adulterants used is not injurious, and the adulteration is 
easily detected. 

Coffee. — Green and roasted coffee may be imitated. An 
inferi<jr grade of coffee is frecjuently branded and sold as a 
better article, and roasted coffee may be adulterated by the 
addition of too much glazing. Ground coffee is frequently 
adulterated, and may contain little or no coffee. Chicory is the 
commonest adulterant. 

Cocoa is fre(juently adulterated by adding stiarch, sugar, 
clay, brick-dust, coloring-matter, and flavoring materials. The 
cocoa-butter may be extracl(Hl and tallow or other fats and oils 
substituted. 

F'loiir is adulterated ])y adding other grains before grind- 
ing or by mixing other flours of an inferior grade or from a 
different grain. h\ the United States the sale of "mixed" 
flours is regulated l)y law. Tlie mixer must pay a special tax, 
and tlie product nnist be correctly labelled. Various mineral 
substances have been found in Euro])ean flours, but such 
a<lulterants are seldom used in the United States. 

Bread. — This has been adulterated by the useof inferior flour, 
and by the addition (»f other substances. Instances have been 
reported of the use of .^-ulphate of copper and of ammonium, and 
alum is also used. In foreign countries soap and gypsum have 
been used, and stannous chlorid has been added to bread made 
fVom an inferior flour, for the purpose of making it resemble 
that made from a better (piality. 

Butter. — This may be adulterated with oleomargarin, but- 
tcrin water (" stretched butter"), lard, cotton-seed oil, beef suet, 
and olive oil. liutter and oleomargarin have about the same 
composition, and j)ossess about e<pial digestibility, with the 
balance -lightly in favor of butter. Oleomargarin is not 
injurioii.-, but to ])re\ent fraud should Ix; correctly labelled. 

I^ard. — This may be adulterated with stearin, cotton-seed 
oil, and watei'. The a(hdterauts are u.-iially harndess. 

Olive oil. — This is lVe(jU<'ntly achdterated with cotton-seed 
oil, etc. I*'oreign oils ai-c not .-o conmioidy adulterated as 
formei'lv, but ibreign labels are fVe(|Uently placed on impure

quently adulterated. J>laek ])epper has heeu exteiisivelv a<hil-

Honey. — After being extracted, honev is sometimes adul- 
terated with glucose or cane-sugar >yrup. Thi- i- not ])ra<'tieed 
to as great an extent as commonly supposed, and pure extracted 
honey may be bought in the o]>en market ( 'onib honey cannot 
be made without the aid of bees. A thin slieet ol' bee.-wax. in 
which there are hexagonal im])r(>ssions coi-respondiiig to the 
bases of the cells, calked cond) Ibundation, is uxd wvx exten- 
sively to bring about greater uniformity in the size of the cell-, 
and also to lessen the labor of the bee. In Juirope it is -aid 
that cerasin and ])aratfin are used for this purpose. 'J1ie\' can- 
not be successfully employed in Amei'ica, ho\\'e\'ei', and bee- 
keepers state that the use of these Maxes is im])os>iblc. JIone\' 
may contain poison. Plugge found that the honev from 
Rliododendrori ponticum is })oisonous, and Xeno[)hon, in !ii> 
Anabasis, describes attacks of intoxication due to eating hoiuy. 
AlthouMi death seemed near, none of his soldiers were killed bv 
it. Strabo and Dioscorides both speak of honey as ])i'oducing 
madness or melancholia. In Abyssinia honey trom the cus^o 
tree is used as an anthelmintic. The honey from gel-endum is 
also poisonous. In Branchville, S. C\, twenty pei'sons wei'e 
made ill and three died from eating hoiuy derived iVom this 
source. In Xew Zealand honey from the '• whaui'iki,'' a cress- 
like plant, causes severe symptoms and sometimes death. 

Glycerin. — This is adulterated with glucose and water. 

Infant Foods. — These are fre(juently adulterated, many 
of them being merely cereal mixtures foi* which an exorbitant 
price is charged. 

Baking-powder. — Starch in large (piantities is oft(Mi 
added to bakIng-])owder. Aliun may be added in ])laee of 
cream of tartar ; but if tJie powder is correctly labelled, and 
the addition is allowed by the state law, it is not to Ix^ con- 
sidered an adulterant. IMallet regards alum baking-powders as 
injurious. This is an (vpen «|uest!on. 

Canned Vegetables and Meat, — These frc(piently con- 
tain substances deleterious to health. Copper and zinc, espcH'i- 
ally the former, may l)e used to color peas. Lead, tin, and zinc 
may be present as the result of unintenti(^nal contaminatii»n. 
Lead may gain entrance from the solder, which is fre(|uently 
ir,

used in large quantities and allowed to drop into the can. 
Lead-stoppered bottles are also sometimes used, and account 
for the presence of lead in the food. Metallic lead is objection- 
able, and the presence of lead salts is highly injurious. There 
are two kinds of tin plate used in the manufacture of cans — the 
" bright/' in which ])ure tin is used, and the ^' terne,'' in which 
a mixture of lead and tin is used. This latter is employed 
for roofing purposes, although it is sometimes wrongly used 
for cans. Preservatives, such as sulphurous acid, salicylic acid, 
boric acid, and others, are frequently added to canned fo(xls. 

Preservatives. — A^arious chemicals are mixed with foods 
to ])reserve them. In many countries the addition of such 
j)re.servatives is forbidden l)y law. Sometimes only (me ])re- 
servatlve is used, but often mixtures of two or more are added 
in combination. Borax and boric acid are the most frequent 
combination. These substances, together witli sulphurous acid, 
sulphites and su]j)hates, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, and formal- 
dehyde, are most frequently employed. A large number of 
other chemicals are used, chiefly to evade laws that forbid 
the use of the drugs just mentioned. It may safely be 
stated tliat the addition of any chemic preservative to food 
is undesirable. There arc diflPerences of opinion regarding the 
jictual etlects of the various preservatives upon the human body. 

Borax and boric acid as ])reservatives are the subject of 
numerous conflicting (^pinions. It is possible that some of the 
favorable opinions have been issued by those who draw their 
salaries ;md their o])inions from tlie same source. While it 
i- stated by many that the use of these chemicals is not in- 
jurions, thcrf; are instances on record where they have caused 
scvei'c syni])toms and even death. J>oric acid and borax 
may, however, fmd their ])ropei" use; in ])reserving meats, 
Mich as hams, for exporting ])ur})oses. Afeat s])rinkled with 
lM»rax or boric acid does not become slimy, as it does without 
it. Before the meat is used, the boric acid should be washed 
<»fT. 'i'lu^ German (lovermnent has expressly forbidden the use 
of -ueh j)ow(lei-s on meats im|torte(l into that countrv. Tliis 
re-tiietion may, how(;vei', have been insj)ire(l by the Agrarian 
p.iitv, and not by consideration for the public health. 

\Vil<v' concludes as the result of his exjx'i-iments that boric 
acid and boi'ax should not l)e used exce])t where preservation is 
a nece-.-itv, an<l where it has i)een shown that other methods of

preservation caimot be eiM})l()y(Hl. Articles (^ontaiiiino; boric 
acid or borax should be ))rop(!rly branded ibr the protection of 
the young, the sick, and the debilitated. Ii:ir<i;e doses (1 or 5 
grams a day) cause loss of appetite and of ability to perform 
work ; moderate doses (."> grams a day) cause; symptoms, but the 
subjects are able to continue work Ibr some time ; small dosi^s 
(I to "2 grams) may be taken for a limited time without result, 
but unfavorable symptoms are ])rodueed in some case.-. " It 
appears, therefore, that boric acid and borax, when continuously 
administered in small doses for a long })eriod, or when given in 
large doses for a short period, create disturbances oC appetite, 
of digestion, and of health.'^ 

Harrington^ has shown that boric acid may be tlie direct cause 
of subacute and chronic nephritis. Food pi'csei-ved with thes(i 
drugs is therefore especially injurious to individuals sulVering 
with Bright's disease. 

Sulphite and bisulphate of sodium are used f )r preserving 
all sorts of food, and especially for preserving the color of meats. 
Tlieir use is regarded as dangerous, and has been prohibited in 
Germany. 

Sulphurous acid is frerpiently nsed, esjKH'ially for ])reserving 
wines. In some countries a certain amount of sulphiu' is allow- 
able in wine, but the amount is often exceeded. It is also 
widely used in preserving the color in dried fruits. 

Salicylic acid is widely used as a preservative. It is exceed- 
inglv powerful, and is used only wliere the taste of the article 
is "not impaired, as in beer, malt extracts, ]n'e-erved fruit and 
the like. In some instances the amount of salicylic acid con- 
tained in food to be eaten by one individual in twentv-four 
hours has been found to equal the maxinunn medicinal dose 
prescribed f)r the same length of time. It is undoubte(lly 
highly objectionable, and its use should be ])rohi])ited. It in- 
hibits digestion and irritates the kidneys ; food preserved with 
salicylic acid is especially injiu'ious in cases of J^right's disease. 

Formaldehyd is frecpiently used for })reserving milk. As 
it hardens meats, it is not usually employed as a meat j)i-eserva- 
tive. In general, it may be stated that the use of formaldehyd 
as a preservative is imdesirable and dangerous. Attempts have 
recently been made to show that in milk v(Ty small aniounts, 
1 : 100,000 and less, would inhibit the growth of bacteria, and 
at the same time not be prejtidicial to health, even to that of 
infants. According to A^aughn, formaldehyd in the proportion

228 VARIOUS FACTORS IX THEIR BEARING OX DIET 

of 1 : 25,000, or 1 : oO^OOO, retards the growth of the hictic 
acid bacilhis, and thus delays the souring of nillk, while it has 
hut little effect on the multiplication of the colon and ty])hoid 
bacilli. It removes the danger signal without removing the 
danger. Such use of formaldeiiyd sliould be prohibited, as it 
miLrht lc:id to the use of milk which, while sweet, might still be 
laden with disease-producing bacteria. 

Hydrogen peroxid is used to a slight extent, and is probably 
the least injurious of all preservatives. 

Metallic Poisons and Food. — Small amounts of metals or 
their sails may lind their way into fo(jd. The metallic salts 
are highly injurious, and may ])roduce either acute or chronic 
])ol.-oning. Many cases of lead-poisoning are traceal)le to con- 
taminated food. 

Lead has been considered in connection with canned goods. 

Copper may be added intentionally as a coloring-matter or it 
may gain entrance from the use of copper or brass kettles. 

Nickel is sometimes used to color green peas, and may be 
found in food cooked in nickel vessels. In the latter event the 
amount found is so small that it may ]^ractically be disregarded. 

Zinc is sometimes found in food, especially in dried apples. 
It o\\'cs its presence to the galvanized iron racks upon which 
apples are fre(]uently dried. Tlie amount present is, liowever, 
so small as to be unimportant. Zinc may also enter food from 
certju'u kinds of solder, but these are now rarely used. 

Arsenic may be introduced into food in various ways. The 
articles most liable to contain it are beer, malt extracts, syru])S, 
and f>ods (;ontaininu' glucose or vinegar, hi the widespread 
occurrence of arsenic-poisoning, in Manclu'stcr, over (),0()0 
persons were affected, and over 100 died. The poisoning was 
caused ])y drinking beer which contained arsenic derived I'rom 
impure sulphuric acid used in the manufacture of brewing sugar 
or gluco>e. In other localities th<' arsenic has been found to !)e 
contained in the malt which had been dried in kilns heated by 
l)in-ning ar.-cnical gas-coke.

phites and fiuorids. The sulpliites are used in meats and the 
fluorids in fruit, and the methods for determining their presence 
are not suited for household use. 

Salicylic Acid. — This is very commonly used in all kinds 
of foods, solids, and liquids, especially fruit ])roducts. It is best 
detected in solution, and solids and semisolids should be mace- 
rated in water and then strained through a white, cotton cloth. 
T\v(» or three ounces of the fluid to be tested is used, adding to 
it a few (lr()])s of sul])huric acid (or about lo grains, the quarter 
of a teas})oonfid, of cream of tartar). Shake thoroughly and 
filter. To the clear li(]uid add three or four tablespoonfuls of 
chlorof>rm, mix by a rotary motion, but do not shake, or an 
enudsion will be formed, which is difficult to break up. Allow 
the chloroform to settle and remove as much as possible by means 
of a pipette or medicine-dropper. This is placed in a test-tube 
with an ecjual amount of water and a small ])iece — a little larger 
than a ])in head — of iron alum. Shake well and allow to settle 
and if salicylic acid is present the u])per layer will have a })urple 
coloi". 

Benijoic Acid. — This is used chiefly in fruit products, cat- 
sup, etc. This test is not sufficiently delicate for very small 
(|uantities, such as may be added to wine. Proceed as above. 
Evaporate the (chloroform by ])lacing in a saucer outside of a 
closed window. In cohl weather place the saucer in a basin of 
ratlier warm ^\■atcr. \\ hen the cldoroform has evaporated, the 
characteristic flat crystals of benzoic acid may be seen in the 
siuieer, and, on warming, the characteristic irritating odor of the 
aeid can \h) detected. 

Borax and Boric Acid. — J^oth of th(>se are used in many 
food products. Macerate solids or semisolids as above, cool the 
li(|uid, and filter through iilter-pa|)er. 

In te-ting butter, place a heaping teas])Oonful in a cup, add a 
couple of tea-poonfuls of hot water, stand the cuj) in hot water

ainnionia turns this brown just as it will turn turmeric ])a|)LT, 
wliicli lias not been dipped in acid solutions. 

Saccharin. — Proceed as in the test ibr salicvlic acid. The 
residue left on evaporating the chloroibrni has the sweet taste ol' 
saccharin. Suo;ar is not soluble in cliloroibrni, so will not Ix- 
present. Jf tannins are present the astrini^'ent taste; may ma-k 
the taste of the saccharin. 

Formaldehyde. — This must be separated by distillation in 
foods other than milk. For milk test, see chapter on milk. 

THE DETERMINATION OF ARTIFICIAL COLORS. 

The Coal-tar Dyes. — If the sul)stance to be examined is 
not a liquid, dissolve the dye by maceratinii' it in watei*. h'ilter, 
take two or three ounces and add a few dro])s ol' hydrochloric 
acid and a few strands of white woolen yarn or ])ieces of \vhite 
woolen cloth. (Before usino^, the wool should be boile<l in watei' 
containing a little soda, to remove any I'at it may contain, and 
then washed in water.) The wool which has been boiled is 
washed tirst in hot and then in cold water, and the water j^ressed 
out. If the wool is not discolored, the substance tested may be 
regarded free from artificial colors. If the wool is colored it 
may be from coal-tar colors, some foreign vegetable colors, or, if 
a fruit is being examined, the natural coloring-matter of the fruit. 
Kinsethe wool in hot water and boil three minutes in two ounces 
of water to which two drams of ammonia have been added. 
Squeeze out the excess of water. Natural fruit color is retained, 
while the coal-tar dyes are usually dissolved in the anunonia 
solution. Add hydrochloric acid to this fluid until the odoi- of 
the ammonia has disappeared and the li(]uid has a sour taste. A 
fresh piece of woolen yarn is boiled in this, and if It is colored, 
the substance examined has been artificially colored. Dull faint 
tints nnist be disregarded. If an anilln dye (coal-tai") has been 
used, the yarn will usually be turned })urple or blue by ammonia. 

The Detection of Copper. — This is often used in color- 
ing canned peas, beans, etc. INlasli the substance to be examined 
and add a teaspoonful of the pulp to three teas})oonfuls of water 
and thirty drops of hydrochloric acid. Place the cup In which 
this has been placed in a water-bath (saucepan containing water 
will do) and add a bright iron wii'c nail. Boil hard twenty 
minutes, stirring frequently with a s})linter of wood or a glass 
rod. If copper is present in any appreciable amount the nail 
will be plated with coj)per. 



232 VARIOUS FACTORS JX THEIR BKARISG ON DIET. 

Turmeric. — This is added to yellow spices, especially mus- 
tai'd ;nid niuce. Mix one-half teaspoonful of the substance to be 
examined in '<\ v.liite china dish with an equal amount of water 
and ilve or ten (lro])s of ammonia. If turmeric is })resent, a 
])r()wn (•()]or is formed. If an insufficient amount of the dye 
lias been used to u'ive this test, a more delicate one is to mix a 
teas])oonfnl of tlie snl)stance to be examined with an ounce of 
jilcoliol and then idlow it to setth^ tifteen or twenty minutes. 
About one-half ounce of the uj)]ier liquid is ])laced in a dish 
with live drops of concentrated solution of boric acid or borax, 
1<) drops of hydrochloric acid, and the S(»lution thoroughly 
mixed. .V wcdn'c-shaj^ed strip of iilrcr-])a])er two or three inches 
!on^\ an inch wide at theii])])er end and one-(juartcr inch at the 
l')\\er eiid, i- then susjx'uded so that the lower end touches the 
-oluiion. The jiaper should not touch the side of the dish. 
Thi- .-h(»ul(l be allowed to stand for a cou])le of hours, and 
it" turmeric is |)resent, a cherrv-red color Ibrms on the iilter- 
paper near the u])|)er edire. This red color is turned dark 
Lfccn or aluK^st black on the addition of ammonia. If too 
much hydrochloric acid has been added, a l)rownish color results. 

Caramel. — This is used to color vinepir and other fluids. It 
should be borne in mind that caramel occurs naturally in malt 
vineirar. Place about one oimce of the fluid to l)e tested in two 
test-tubes, add a teas]>oonful of fuller's earth to one and sliake 
\iLrorou>ly two or three minutes. Filter through iilter-paper. 
I'he fir.-t part of the THpiid connni;' throuu^h the ]iaper should be 
returned to be liltered a secon<l time. If the filtered liquid on 
eompari-on with the untreated test-tube is markedly lighter in 
eoloi", one may assume that the color of the li(|uid is due to car- 
amel, which is largely i-cmoved by the fuller's earth. This test 
re(juii-e- a certain amount of practical experience before residts 
can l)e dejuauU-d upon. 

THE EXAMINATION OF VARIOUS FOODS. 

Coffee. — The diirerenee between gi"ound coifcc and that which 
Iia- hecn a<lulterat<'d can often be told bv the naked (ye, esjx'ci- 
ally if not \-ery linely ground. I*ure colfce has a uniform ap- 
pearance, with dull surfaces, while mo<t (»f the substitutes, par- 
liculai'ly pea- and beans, liax'e poli-hed suri"ac(-s. ('hi<-ory is 
veiy dai'k and gummy looking and the panicles have a distinctly 
a-tringeiit ta-te. ( )u placing ground cotl'ee in a bottle half i"ull 
<'f water, shaking it and allowiiiL'" it to stand, a lai-gc amount of 
the coffee will float, wliile mo-t of the sul)-titutes sink at once to

the bottom. The chicorv ])arti('h's will color water, and as they 
sink slowly to the bottom leave a little (lai'k train bchiiul them. 
Coilee contains no starch, while all of the sub-ta.iices except chic- 
orv used for adnlteration contain a consldei-ablc amoniil. All 
t^round coffee that gives a starch reaction may Im; considered as 
adulterated. 

Flavorings Extracts. — \^anilla and lemon are the most 
commonly used and most adulterated. Tliev are fre(jueiitl\' 
made with the extract of the tonka bean, which can be de- 
termined by the ])eculiar odor by any one familiar with the 
two products. The extract made from the ai-tlficlal \-anillin 
lacks the resins. Caramel Is oftcMi a.dded tocoloi- it, and iii:!\- 
be detected by shaking; the ibam of pure extracts is col^r- 
l(>ss, and if caramel is ])resent, little ])oints of color will be <een at 
the point of contact with the bubbles. The fuller's earth te.-t, 
given above, may also be used. To examine ibr the ])re-ence (•!' 
resiiis, the extract should be evaporjited, and wlun it reaches one- 
third its volume the resins l)ecome insoluble and settle to the 
bottom, while artificial extracts remain, clear. Jf water i- novv' 
added, the resin will se])a rate out in a brown ])reclj>lta.te. A few 
dro])s of hydrochloric acid slutuld be added, the li(|uid >tirred 
and tlu'ji filtered ; the resin left on the lilter-])aper should be 
washed with water and then dissolved in a little alcohol, and to one 
}>;u't of this add a few drops of hydrochloric acid and to another 
a small particle of ferric alum. The resin from the vanilla bean 
has only a slight change of color, while Avitli most other resins 
one or both of these reagents yield a distiuct color change. 

Lemon extract may be tested by ])lacing a teaspoonf"ul of the 
oil in a test-titbe and adding two or three teaspoonfuls of 
water. A\ ith real lemon extract the fund fivt becomes tur- 
bid and later the oil of lemon se])arates on the to[) of the water. 
If it remains ])erfectly clear, it is a low-gra>de product and con- 
tains very little if any oil of lemon. 

Spices. — The detection of adulteration in s])Ices, ibr the 
most part, reqinres expert knowledge of chemistry and micro- 
scopy. ]Most of the substances used contain starch, but so tlo 
most of the connnon spices. Cloves, nntstard, and cayeime 
pepper are practically free from starch, and tlie presence of it 
may be taken as a proof of adtdteratlon. To test for starch, 
one-half teaspoouful of the susjxTted spice should be stirred 
into one-half cup of boiling water and boiled fbr several min- 
utes and then cooled. If the fluid is of very dark col(»r it shotild 
have water added to it, and to this a single droj) of iodine is

added. If starch is jiresent it gives the characteristic deep blue 
color, and if very much is ]^resent it turns black. If no blue 
color a|)])ears, tlie iodine should l)e added drop bv drop until it 
sho\\> in the solution. 

Vinegar. — The simplest test is the odor. If it is not ap- 
parent the o'lass should be rinsed out with the vinegar and allowed 
to stand for some hours, when the odor of the residue will l)e 
quite distinct ; cider vinegar having the fruit odor and wine 
vinegar the(tdor of wine. The residue may also be obtained by 
eva])oration. If the vinegar has been colored, the caramel can 
!)(' tested by the fuller's earth test. It should be borne in mind 
that many of the vinegars made from spirits and wood have 
a])ple jellv added to give rhem the characteristic odor. 

The Halphen Reaction for Cottonseed Oil, — Car- 
})on di-ul])hide, containing about 1 percent, of sulphur in solu- 
tion, is mixed with an ecpial volume of amyl alcohol. Equal 
\'olumes of this reagent and of the oil to be examined are mixed 
and heated in a bath of boiling brine for fifteen minutes. In 
the ])res('nce of as little as 1 per cent, of cottonseed oil an 
t)range or red color is produced which is characteristic, l^ard 
and lard oil fi-om animals fed on cottonseed meal will sometimes 
give a faint reaction. 

DIET AS A MEANS OF DIAGNOSIS. 

Test-meals are given to determine the functional disturbances 
of the st(»maeli, and to ascertain whether or not pathologic con- 
<htions exi>t. There are many forms of test-meals and thev 
s<rve various ])Ui-])o>es. 

Test-meals :^mployed to Stimulate the Gastric 
Secretion for the Purpose of Determining the Se- 
cretory Function of the Stomach.—]. The Test=break= 
fast of Ewald and Boas. — This consists of a roll or a slice 
of wheat bread (:>o to 70 gm.) and }()() e.c. of water or tea 
without sugar or milk, taken in the nioi-ning on a fa>ting stomach. 
'i lie contents of the .-tomach are removed one hour afterward. 

'1. The test=dinner of Riegel consists of 4()0 c.c. of soup, 
-!()l) <rin. of beef-teak, TO um. ,,f hivad, and a glass oi' water 
(•><'() r.r.)^ taken at noon. 'Hie st«.niach is em})tied of its con- 
tents in from ibui" to six hours. 

■ \. Test-meal of Germain S^e. — This consists of GO to 
SO gni. of scraped beef and 100 to 1 oO gni. of wheat bread. 
The content- are i-enio\-e(l after two hour>. 



DIET AS A MEANS OE DIAGNOSIS. 2:>5 

4. Test=mea! of Klemperer. — Klempcrcr gives J liter of 
milk and 70 gin. of" wlieat bread and empties the stomach t\V(j 
hours afterward. 

5. The Double Test=meal of Salzer. — This eonsi>ts of 
40 gni. of beef seraped and boiled; l2o() e.e. of milk ; oO gm. 
of boiled riee, and 1 soft-boiled egg. This is followed in 
four hours by an Ewald test-meal, and the contents of the 
stomach are withdrawn one hour after. 

6. The Oatmeal Test=breakfast of Boas. — Fhis bnakfast 
is composed of a ])lateful of oatmeal broth prt>j)ared by boiling 
down to J liter 1 liter of water to which a tea>poonfnl of 
oatmeal and a pincli. of salt have previously been added. This 
test has for its object the determination of lactic acid, inasnnich 
as kictic acid is ])rescnt in all ordinary l)reads utilized i'nv test- 
meals. 

On account of its simplicity, the Ewald-I)oas test-breakfast 
is most useful, although occasionally a Riegel diimei" is ibund 
preferable; the only objection to the latter lies in the fact that 
in withdrawing the stomach-contents bits of meat that may not 
have been thoroughly digested are a])t t(^ obstruct the ])assage 
of the contents through the tnbcc In exmuining f )r lactic acid 
the Boas oatmeal test is preferred. (For a description of the 
various methods of examining the contents of the stomach for 
acid, ferments, etc., the reader is referred to the text-books on 
diseases of the stomach and on clinical diagnosis.) 

Dietetic Tests for Determining- the Motor Power 
of the Stomach. — 1. flethod of Leube. — This test c(Misists 
in having the patient take 400 e.c. of sotip, 200 gm. of beef- 
steak, 50 gm. of bread, and 200 c.c. of water. The stomach is 
washed out at the end of six hours ; if it is ibund to be em])ty 
at this time, there can be no motor impairment of the 
stomach. 

2. Method of Boas. — If the stomach be washed out at the 
end of two hours after an ordinary Kwald-l)oas test-break- 
fast, under normal conditions the stomach should be fotmd 
empty. 

3. Test=supper of Boas. — This supper consists of cold meat 
with bread and butter and a large cup of tea. If, on washing 
out the stomach the following morning, food is still found to be 
present, a dilatation of the stomach exists.

Functions of the Stomach. — Method of Sahli. — In this

te.-t .substances Dot absorbed by the stomach are added to a test- 
meal. After ^vitlld^l^val of the stomach-contents it is possible 
to determine liow much of the test-meal has passed into the 
intestine, Iionv much remains in the stomacli, and how nuich 
of the Avithdrawn meal c(jn>ists of gastric secretion. The Sahli 
test-meal consists of the following : 2.") gm. of ordinary flonr 
[ind ]'") gm. of l)utter are ])laced in a suita.ble vessel over a 
ilame and allowed to roast n.ntil brown. To tliis are slowly 
a<ided 'JoO c.c. of water, and the whole stirred constantly; a 
pinch of salt, snfhcient for seasoning, is added, and the mixtnre 
i- allowed to boil for one or two mimites. After the stomach 
Inis been thoroughly washed out tlie ])ati('nt is given 300 c.c. 
of this SOU]), and the remaining oO o.c. are retained as a control. 
Al'tei' one hour the stomach contents are withdrawn and the 
(|uantity is noted. Three hundred cubic centimeters of water 
are now intr(xhi<-ed through the tube, and the stomach is gently 
ma-saged ; within a few minutes this diluted meal is ^ith- 
(li-awn and its (juantity noted. ^ 

Dietetic Test in the Diagnosis of Atypical Cases 
of Ulcer of the Stomach. — In cases of atypical forms of 
ulcer of the stomach Teube advises In's dietetic treatment (see 
]). 42-1) as an aid to diagnosis. If a l)eneficial result follows 
the treatment, the presence of an ulcer is indicated. 

Dietetic tests are often of value as a means of diagnosis and 
jtroii'nosis in diabetes. These tests are described in the section 
ou Diabetes {y>. 07 4). 

Schmidt and Strassburger Test-Diet. — Strauss uses the fol- 
lowing modiiication of this diet, as follows: Milk, IJ litres; 
.-(•raped meat, HO grams; mashed ])otatoes, 200 grams; egii^s, 2 
grams : butter, 40 grams ; oatmeal gruel, made with 40 grams 
oatmeal; bouillon, \ litre ; and (J zwieback of 1 (S grams each. 
The bcirinning of this diet is marked bv giving carmine. In 
iM'altli t!ii> diet will go through the intestine in 15 to 25 houi's. 
Ill (bari-hca, where the principal trouble is in thecolon, in 10 to 
15 hours; and where ther" is inci'eased ])eristalsis of the entire 
bowef ill )\ to 5 hours. To test the digestion of certain articles 
of (bet twice tlieu-iial amoimt should be given, and charcoal uiav 
be ii-^ed to mark the Ibod -o given, '^riie amount of mucus, the 
appearance, tlu; reaction, the amount of fermentation, may all be 
noied. Thi- metho<l of studying stools is simple, easily carried 
out, and oi' great practical value.

DIET FOR SIMIKIIS AM) SPKA Kh'IlS. 'l-\i 

Schmidt's Test Diet. — On arising in the niorning: Onc-lialf 
liter of milk; tea or cocoa (if possible, willi milk), together 
with one roll with butter, and one soft-boiled egg. 

Brcakfad. — One dish of oatmeal, cooked in milk and strained 
(salt or sugar permissible). Under certain conditions gruel or 
porridg(i may also be given. 

At Xoon. — One-fourth pound of iniely-(;hopp<'d lean Ix'cf 
boiled rare, with butter (the interior raw), and, with it, nnt too 
small a portion of })otato broth (well strainctl). 

In the Afternoon. — Same as in the morning, with raw egir. 

In the Evening. — One-half liter of milk or a })late of -oup 
(as in the morning), together with a buttered roll and one or 
two egsj^s, soft boiled or scrambled. 

The test diet is given at least for three days, until a stool i^ 
obtained coming with certainty from the diet. If comieetive 
tissue appears in the stool, it is an indication of a disturbance 
of gastric digestion. If muscle appears in the stools, tlua'e must 
be some disturbance of the small intestine. If both muscle and 
comieetive tissue are present, a disturbance of both stomach and 
intestine is at hand. 

DIET FOR SINGERS AJND SPEAKERS, 

The diet exerts considerable influence on the voice. A full 
meal may impair the respiration to such an extent as to inter- 
fere with singing or even to make it entirely im])ossible. The 
congestion of the vocal cords which may follow the taking of 
food or drink or smoking often has an injin'ious elfect on the 
voice. Irritating articles of food and drink may ;ilso impair 
the voice, and should always be avoitled by siiigei-s and speak- 
ers. Singers often possess curious idiosyncrasies, certain articles 
of food impairing the voice of some while improving that of 
others. W. C. Kussell, in Representdtive ^[rtnrs^ gives an inl.r- 
esting list of articles taken l)y prominent actors before going 
on the stage. He states that Kdnmnd ]\ean, Kmery, and 
Reeve drank cold water and brandy; fJohn Kemble toitk 
0})liun ; Lewis, nnilled wine and oysters; ^Nlacready was nceus- 
tomed to eat the lean of a mutton cho]) previous to going on 
the stage, but subsecpiently lived almost exelu-ively on a vege- 
table diet; Oxbury drank tea; Henry Kussell ate a boiled 
egg; AY. Smith drank coffee; Braham dra.nk bottled porter; 
Miss Catley took linseed tea and ^Madeira ; (». V. Cook woidd 
drink anything ; Henderson used gum arable and sherry ; 
Incledon drank ^Madeira ; ^Nlrs. Jordan ate calves'-lbot jelly 



238 VARIOUS FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING ON DIET. 

and sherry ; C. Kean took beef-tea ; Mrs. Wood sang on 
drausfbt ])orter ; Harley took nothing during a performance. 
Malibran, it is said, ate a hinch in his dressing-room half an 
hour before singing. This consisted of a cutlet and half a 
bottle of wliite wine, after ^^•hich he smoked a cigarette until it 
was time to appear. 

As a rule, nothing should be eaten before singing or speaking. 
Tlie princi])al meal should be taken two or three hours before, 
and it sliould be somewhat lighter than usual. Many singers 
eat but little on the day of their performance, but partake of a 
good meal afterward. A food much used ])y singers is the so- 
called " Jeimy Lind soup.^^ This is very bland and does not 
alter the voice. It is made of bouillon and sage, to whicli are 
added, before serving, the yolks of two eg^s beaten up in a 
half-pint of cream. A half-teaspoonful of sugar is added, and 
it is flavored with sj^ices. Others take raw eggs, egg and 
sherry, or albumin-water, while still others })refer jellies of the 
gelatin variety, or even honey. Orange-juice has its advocates, 
and the chewing of dried ])lums has been recommended. Mandl 
suggests that before the performance the singer should take a 
few bites of bread or chocolate and rinse the moutli with cold 
water. If the song is lengtliy, cold water or sugar water may 
be taken during the performance. 

In the interval between concerts the singer should live on a 
general mixed diet, avoiding irritating foods. Most siugers 
have a tendency to become stout. The general rules f )r dieting 
the obese may be enforced to prevent or to ivmedy this. 

Alcohol, in the form of the stronger beverages, is harmful to 
the voice and should always be avoided. JJght wines and 
])eer, excei)t Avlien taken to excess, are n<»t generally injurious. 
They are best avoided, however, as their use may Iciid t(^ the 
formation of the liquor habit. 

Smoking is injurious to the voice. According to ]\rackenzie, 
however, many famous singers used tobacco freely without ap- 
parent harmful effects. 

DIET DURING ATHLETIC TRAINING. 

The course of diet and exercise which aTlilet<3S, botli amateur 
aud j)rof(?ssioual, uudei-go to iit them pliy>ically for games, con- 
tents, or feats of (;n(hirance, is known as athletic trainiug. The 
ne<'essity for such training is fully recognized ])y all athletes, 
and while opinions differ as to methods, there is perfect accord 
in the ideal that is souirht. 



DIF.T nUniNG ATHLETIC TRAINING. 2:^9 

Protessional athletes who are constantly j)erioi-niIn^ feats of 
stren<>;th, skill, or endurance, are, for the nio'^t j»art, more or 
less constantly in training, and reeogni/c the importance of 
keeping in perfect trim. While occasional iii(lulg<'nces mav 
not be harmful, continued dissipation is always disasti-ous in 
its consequences. This is es[)ecially true where Unci- skill and 
judgment are required and steady nerves are a necessity. 

The ultimate object of all training is to reduce the bodv- 
weight luitil it will remain constant under the regular routiue 
of life during the training ])eriod. There is usuallv a loss of 
weight for the first few weeks^ varying with the ])i-evious con- 
dition of the individual. In about three weeks the weight 
becomes constant. The loss of weight is accom])lislied at the 
expense of the fat and water in the tissues. In well-trained 
men the nniscles are hard and firm, the fat is reduced to a miui- 
nnuii, the skin is clear, the eyes are bright, the expression i< 
indicative of perfect health, the body is active, svelt, and full 
of verve, and the '^ Avind '' is good. In the undertrained indi- 
vidual the tissues arc not hardened and the ^' wind " is not so 
good. In the overtrained there is a cin'ious condition, chie to 
overexertion or a badly chosen dietary, or both, and the indi- 
vidual loses weight and energv, and is in everv \vav tmlitted 
for the contest for which he was preparing. 

The length of time reqnired to train an individual varies 
greatly, but a college youth of the average athletic ty])e can 
usually be put in good shape in six weeks. The transition 
from ordinary life to that of training should be gradual. This 
is true both of diet and of exercise. 

The diet-tables of various trainers differ considerably. As a 
general rule it may be said that the diet should consist of 
wholesome food, such as good lean beef or nuitton, be>l given 
nnderdone, toast or stale bread, and potatoes and green vege- 
tables of all kinds. Among the proscribed articles are all 
entrees, puddings, pastries, sauces, pickles, spices, '^ a}^j)eti/ers," 
and all fancy and complex dishes. Twice-cooked meat should 
be avoided. All spirits and strong alcoholic drinks, as well as 
tea, coffee, and nerve stimulants of any kind, should be pro- 
hibited. Some trainers allow a moderate amount of light wine 
or beer, while others forbid their use entirely. On the whole, it 
would seem best to omit them. Tobacco in all f )rms is forbidden. 

AVater is usually allowed in con.siderable (juantity — generally 
as much as is desired — early in the training. If there is a 
tendency to obesity, the amount is somewhat limited. The 
quantity is reduced gradually, only suflicient l)eing allowed to

allay thirst ; it should be sipped slowly. The ini])ortance of 
liiiiitino: tlie amount of water invested for a few days before any 
contest is recognized by all professional athletes and trainers. 

Food is best given in three meals, at about equal intervals 
of time : Breakfast between 8 and 9 ; dinner between 1 and 2 ; 
and su])per between 7 and 8 or 8 and 9. 

The relation of sugar to training is of cs]iecial interest, and 
opinions concerning its use diff'ei'. Men in training seem to 
crave sugar, and are often allowed a reasonable amount on 
cereals, or in tea and coiFee vJien flic latter (ire iiscfJ, but it is 
gcr.erally deemed advisable to f )rbid its use in pastrie- and cakes. 
Furthci' .-tudy i- nci'dcd to decide this (piestion. In this connec- 
tion it is interesting to consider the report concerning the addi- 
tion of sugar to the diet of two club crews in Holland during the 
training for a race. Atwater and I>ryant'' cite the Ibllowingcase : 

''Two young men with only two hours a day for ])ractice, at 
the end of two months entered ibr the race. No change had 
been made from tlieir usual diet excej^t that they ate as much 
sugar as they wished, sometimes as much as a third of a ])Ound, 
at the time of their daily exercise. One of them, however, did 
not make this addition to his diet until the third week, when 
he began to show all the signs of overtraining — loss of weight 
and a heavy, dull feeling, with no desire lor study. On the 
third day after beginning the use of sugar these svmptoms dis- 
a])peared. ^Vt the time of the I'ace both youths were victori(jus 
over their antagonist-^, who did not Ix'lievc in. the use of sugar. 
Xo bad eifects were ol)served." 

The accom[)anying interesting table (p. 242) is taken from 
the report ^ mentioned. 

Thompsoti^ gives the following report of the Yale crew, on 
the authority ol' Di-. Hartwell, ibrmerly a captain of the Uni-

such as rice, bread, or tapioca pudding, some fruit, and the 
same beverages as at breakfast were also used. The meats 
inchided roast ])eef, mutton, or ehieken, two kinds Ix'ing always 
served. ]>ut little gravy was used. J^'ish was served twice a 
week. The vegetables ineluded potatoes, nia>lied or boiled; 
tomatoes, ])eas, beans, and corn. Two vegetables besides 
potiitoes were usually served. Supper (S to S.lo p. m.) con- 
sisted of cereals, as at breakfast ; eho])s, stews, or cold meat 
from dinner ; rarely beefsteak ; potatoes, stewed or baked ; and 
eofffs about three times a week, usuallv not on tlie same davs 
that they were served for breakfast. Sonu>times ale was ])er- 
mitted to some individual. After the crews were in final 
preparation for the race at New London the diet varicnl some- 
what. Breakfast and dinner remained about the same, but a 
light luncheon of cold meat, stewed or baked ])otatoes, milk 
and toast was served at 4.30 in the afternoon. After this the 
evening exercise was engaged in for about tw^) hours. ]^^)rty- 
five minutes after this was completed cold oatmeal or other 
cereal with milk and toast was served. A light su])})er (1>. .">()) 
was served just before the men retired. This diet was much 
more liberal than that served ten years before. The men were 
allowed as much food as they desired.'^ 

Atwater and Bryant^ give the following account of the diet 
of the Harvard boat crew at Cambridge, in l.S9<S, in the de- 
scription of the conditions of their dietary studies. The diet 
was sim})le, and consisted of roast and broiled beef and lamb, 
fricasseed chicken, roast turkey, and broiled fish. Eggs, raw, 
poached, or boiled in the shell, were used plentifully. Large 
amounts of milk and cream were also consumed. Oatmeal, 
hominy, and shredded wheat were eaten extensively, and corn 
cakes were served occasionally. I^read was almost always 
taken in the form of dry toast. Potatoes were served t\vice a 
day, either baked or boiled and mashed with the addition of 
a little milk and butter; occasionally they were '^creamed." 
Boiled rice, prepared with a little cream and sugar, was served 
instead of potatoes at some meals. 13eets, jiarsnips, green ])eas, 
and tomatoes were used to furnish a variety of vc^i^etables. 
Macaroni was occasionally served. For dessert, apple, tapioca, 
custard, or other pudding containing a large j)ro])ortion of milk 
and eggs, was served. The members of the crew were allowed 
beer once a day. Milk was obtained from one of the large 
creameries supplying that vicinity, and was of unusually good qual- 
ity, containing 5.8 per cent, of butter- fat. A very thick, heavy

beefsteak was freed from bone and from nearly all the vi-ible iat

Lamb chops were served with the bone. Lamb and mutton 
roasts, which were all taken from the leg, were also clear meat, 
trinmied so as to be ])racticallv free from vi-ible fit. LIk; 
turkey used was shipped from a distance, and had been kept in 
cold storage. It was baked with f>rce-meat, — /. c, '^stuHing" 
or ^"'dressing,'' — although but little of this latter was sei"\<'<l lo 
the crew. Chicken was always fricasseed, and served IVee iVom 
all bones, with the exception of those of the leg and wing. 

Broiled iisli, usually bluefish or Spanish mackerel, was com- 
monly served for breakfast, as were also eggs, either raw or 
poached. Xo pastry was allowed, and the puddings were, 
as previously stated, composed largely of eggs and milk. A 
small amount of coffee jelly was served, and at on(> meal 
during the study ice-cream was allowed. Xo fi'csh fruit, with 
the exception of oranges for breakfast, was served. Stewed 
prunes, rhubarb, or apples were also eaten, prunes most tibun- 
dantlv. Xo beverages other than water, milk, and beer wei-e 
allowed. Breakfast was served at 8, lunch at I, and diimer at 
6 o'clock, although one or the other of the crews was u-ually 
late at dinner. Atwater and Biyant ^ give the f)llowing

244 VARIOUS FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING OX DIET. 

^^ The loss of weiglit during the period of exercise is due 
principally to water of perspiration and the water and carbon 
dioxid excreted in the breath." 

It is interesting, in this connection, to coni})are the diet of 
the English boat crews, as given by Yeo.^ Maclaren gives the 
following schemes of training as carried out at Oxford and 
Cambridge :

vegetables, rice pudding or jelly, 

and I })int of beer. 
10 p. M.: Retire to bed. 
Water strictly forbidden. As little 

li(piid to be drunk as possible. 

In summing up the results of their ol)scrvations Atwater and 
J^ryant state that, in a '' general way, the diiference between 
the food of the athletes and that of other ])eople represents a 
difference in actual })ljysi('al need even if neither is an accurate 
measure of that need." One of the cliief differences lies in the 
ftict that the food of athletes is ])rodu('tive of a larger amount 
of energy than that consumed by ordinary working-people or 
college men. The daily excess over the ordinary diet was 
about 400 calories, or about 10 ]wv cent. The amount of i)ro- 

' Fo<»/ ill Jl-nlth awl Di.-oisr, p. 281. 



DIET DURING ATHLETIC TRAL\L\(;. 245 

tern consumed was 45 per cent, larj^cr. " In otlicr words, the 
difference in protein was four and one-half times as ^rpoat as the 
difference in fnel-vahie, and tlie excess in protein would account 
for a considerable part of the excess of eneriry of the diet of 
the athletes as compared with men in ordinary occu})ation." 

Atwatcr and Bryant * close the account of their experiments 
with the following interesting observations : 

^^ In this connection it is interesting to obsc^rv^e that many 
physiologists are coming to entertain the view that the amoimt 
of metiibolism in the body is regulated not simply l)y the mus- 
cular work, but also by the nervous effort re([uired in the per- 
formance of this work. The es})ecially large proportion of 
protein observed in the dietary studies of the imiversity boat 
crews, of foot-ball teams, of the professional athlete, and of 
the pugilist, as compared with tiie dietary studies of c(dlege 
men with ordinary exercise, and with ordinary flimilies of 
Avorkingmen and professional men, accord well with a view not 
uncommon of late among physiologists. According to this 
view, men w^ho perform continued muscular labor, even if it is 
active enough to make the total amount large, do not retjuire 
especially large amounts of protein in their food so long as 
they undergo no especial mental strain or muscidar fatigue, the 
principal requirements being an abundant supply of easily di- 
gested food-material. On the contrary, when a man or animal 
must perform intense muscular work for a short period of time, 
and is, therefore, under more or less nervous as well as muscu- 
lar strain, a considerably larger supply of protein seems to be 
required than under normal conditions of slow, long-contintied 
work. In other words, if a large amount of work must be done 
in a short time a considerable excess of protein is required in 
the food. This view, which has been especially advocated by 
Zuntz,^ seems to be favored by the results of dietary studies 
above discussed. 

" Recent experiments made by Dunlop, Paton, Stockman, 
and Maccadam^ have to do with the amount of protein reipiired 
when severe muscular work is performed. The results are dis- 
cussed with especial reference to training, and are believed to 
" show the importance of two points long known to athletes 
and others doing excessive muscular w^ork. The one is the im- 
portance of proper training, for by it an abstraction of proteid

246 VARIOUS FACTORS IN THEIR BEARING ON DIET. 

matter from tissues other than muscle can be avoided ; the other 
is tlie importance of there being a sufficiency of protein in the 
diet to compensate for the loss which occurs. An abundance 
of ])rotein in the diet of an athlete has other functions to fulfil 
besides this. It is required during training for building up the 
energy-liberating mechanism — the protoplasm of muscle ; and 
it is also required after work to repair that mechanism. The 
benefits of training are well known in other ways, such as pre- 
paring the heart for suddenly increased duty and limiting the 
after fatigue effects. 

^^The })ower of the body to perform the maximum of muscu- 
lar work within a comparatively short time and with a minimum 
amount of fatigue is secured by means of training. Of course, 
skill in application of muscular strength is as essential as is the 
amount of ])ower exerted. The skill is sought by exercise and 
practice. The object of regulating the diet in training is not 
only to furnish tlie material to supply the power, but also to 
put the machine in the best condition for developing as well as 
applying the power. In otlier words, the man is to be sub- 
jected for a short time to intense muscular strain and consider- 
able nervous effort. Tliis he is to bear with a maximum of 
result and the minimum of fatigue. For this he needs ])ractical 
training, on the one hand, and })ro])er diet, on the other. If 
the views above presented are correct, the diet for men from 
wliom intense muscular effort is required ibr short ])criods 
should su{)])ly liberal amounts of energy and especially large 
amounts of protein." 



INFANT FEEDING. 

The subject of iufiint foeding, (Inrinu^ hoth lic-ihli and disease, 
is one of extreme importance, and one on which success in 
pediatric practice largely depends. liefore taking up the study 
of infant feeding the student shoidd read carel'ully the section 
on Milk. 

Infancy is that period of- life dating from l)irth to al)out two 
and one-half years. Childhood is the })eriod from two and one- 
half years to puberty. The theory that infancy ends at two 
and one-half years is an arbitrary one. 

There are four methods of feeding infants : 1. IJreast- or 
maternal feeding. 2. Wet-nursing. 3. Mixed feeding — /. ^"., 
breiust-feeding supplemented by bottle-feeding. 4. Ijottle- or 
artificial feeding. 

1. Breast-feeding. — The milk from a healthy mother is 
by far the best nourishment for an infant diu'ing the first year 
of its life, and can not be fully replaced by any other form of 
feeding;. Infants fed on the breast-milk of a lu>althv woman 
are stronger and better able to resist disease. While it is true 
that babies may be reared on artificial foods and remain healthy 
and grow strong, the percentage of robust bottle-fed l)abies is 
much smaller than that of healthy breast-fed infants. This is 
particularly true of the poorer classes, who often lack both tlie 
time and the intelligence required to rear a h(>althy inlant by 
bottle-feeding. 

Contraindications to Maternal Nursing. — T\w fi)llowing 
rules, adapted from Holt, will l)e found a reliable guide in 
determining whether or not a mother is fitted to nurse lier child : 

1. If the mother has tuberculosis in any form, latent or 
active, she should not nurse her child. A tuberculous mother 
not only exposes her child to infection, but hastens the ])r()gress 
of the disease in herself. If the mother has ])ulmonary tuber- 
culosis, nursing is almost certain to prove i'atal to her. 

2. When the mother has had any serious complication, such 
as nephritis, convulsions, severe hemorrhage, (^r septic infection, 
during pregnancy or parturition, she should not be allowed to 
nurse her infant. 

3. If the mother is choreic or epileptic, nursing is contrain- 
dicated. 



248 INFANT FEEDING. 

4. If the mother is very feeble or has any serious chronic 
disease, the child will derive little, if any, benefit from breast- 
feeding and the mother will be greatly injured. 

5. Nursing should not be attempted where experience has 
shown on two ])revious occasions, under favorable conditions, 
that the mother is unable to nourish her child. 

6. When no milk is secreted, feeding is, of course, imjx)ssible. 

Good artificial feeding is to be preferred to poor breast-feed- 
ing. If artificial feeding must be resorted to, it is well to begin 
early, for the infant's digestive organs are then apt to be in 
comparatively good condition. The question has two sides, 
however, and must carefully be considered. 

Many mothers with an abundance of maternal love and 
manifold good intentions are often lacking in intelligence and 
c^n not be taught the proper care of an infant. 

If the prospective mother is under observation during preg- 
nancy, the breasts should be carefully examined, and if the 
nipples are found to be short or retracted, measures should be 
taken to correct this condition. This may be done by exercis- 
ing gentle traction upon the nipple daily. In extreme cases of 
retraction a breast-pump may be needed. During the entire 
nursing period the breasts should receive careful attention. 
Cleanliness is imperative, and after each nursing the breast should 
be carefully washed, preferably with a solution of boric acid. 

During the first forty-eight hours the child receives practi- 
cally no nourishment from the ])reast, the only fluid secreted 
during this time being colostrum. This has a laxative eflfect 
upon the infant's bowels, emptying them of the dark brownish 
material, known as meconium, which has accumulated in the 
intestinal canal during uterine life. The child should, however, 
be ])ut to the breast at regular intervals, so as to establish a 
free flow of milk ; this generally begins on the third day, but is 
sonKjtimes delayed. 

During the first two days of its existence the child gets about 
six ounces of colostrum a day, which is all that is needed. It 
may, however, be given a teaspoonful or two of warm boiled 
\\;it(r or of a 5 per cent, solution of sugar of milk. In un- 
u.-ually ro]>ust l)ut fretful children, or when there is fever, a 
small amount of nourishment may Ix' required ; this should be 
given according to the rules for artificial i'eeding. If the milk 
is delayed bevond fortv-eiglit hours, it becomes necessary to 
feed the cliild by the bottle until the flow is established. The 
child should be ])ut to the })reast regularly, or the breast-puni]) 
may be used to >timulate the secretion of the milk. Fennel,

catnip tea, and the like slioiild he excluded from the child's 
dietary. (For a careful consideration of the question of feed in n^ 
during early infancy, and for other (juestions concerninfi; infant 
nutrition, the reader is referred to the excellent work of (./erny 
and Keller, Des Kiiidcs-EnidliruiKj und Juiidhruiu/s-T/urajjic.) 

Before enterin(r upon a consideration oi' hreast-feedinir itself 
one or two points in connection witli the suhject must he ex- 
plained. Many mothers do not mu'se their infants hecause 
they have not been properly instructed as to the importance of 
doing it; others, because the matter is left to the nurse, who, 
after two or three trials, decides that the mother is incapable of 
nursing her baby; in the latter case the probabilities are that 
nothing is wrong with the modier. Often, too, the attendiniz; pli\- 
sician, especially if he is an obstetric specialist, is a])t to give liis 
attention wholly to the mother, leaving the child to the nurse's care. 

The mental attitude of the mother has a marked effect on the 
milk secretion, and if she has been properly instructed and 
encouraged beforehand, there is usually no difficulty. If, on 
the other hand, she has grave doubts as to her capabilitv, and 
particularly if she hears both physician and nurse discuss her 
probable incompetency, the milk secretion may be inhibited. 
The mental condition of the mother is often affected as the 
result of weighing the child. It is very desirable that the 
child be weighed regularly and the weight recorded ; but if the 
mother is at all nervous, or if the child is not doing well, the 
weighing should not be done by the mother or in her ])resence. 
A loss in weight, or even the fact that there is no material gain, 
may so affect the mental condition of the mother as to prove 
deleterious to the secretion of milk, \yith proper encourage- 
ment and by stimulating the breast by placing the child at it at 
regular intervals the flow of milk is promoted. 

The subject of the fitness of mothers for nursing their infants 
is receiving more attention of late years, and in Germany an 
attempt has been made to show that the daughters of alcoholic 
parents or ancestry are a])t to be incapable of nursing their 
infants. While this has been proved statistically, an alcoholic 
ancestry is of so common occurrence that almost any existing 
evil might be attributed to it and its relationship proved. 

Breast-nursing often proves a failure because the mother does 
not understand how to give the breast to the child. AVith the 
increase in civilization there seems to be a diminution in in- 
stinct, and careful directions should be given in every case. 
The child should lie on the right or left arm, according to 
whether the child is to nurse at the right or at the left breast. 



250 INFANT FEEDING. 

If the mother is in a sittiiiii; ])Ostare, her body should be in- 
clined .slightly forward. With her free hand she should grasp 
the breast near the nipple between the first two fingers. If, 
owing to the free flow of milk, the child takes the milk too 
rapidly, this may be checked by slight pressure of the fingers. 
The child should nurse until satisfied. The contents of one 
breast are generally sufficient for one nursing, and the breasts 
should be used alternately. When satisfied, the infant will 
usually fall asleep at the breast. Under ordinary conditions 
the nursing should last for from about ten to twenty minutes. 
If the milk is taken too rapidly, vomiting may ensue immedi- 
ately after or during feeding. If too much is taken, it is re- 
gurgitated almost immediately. If the infant consumes more 
than half an hour in nursing, the breast and the milk should 
be examined. As the infant grows older it requires and takes 
more food, and consequently will require a longer time to nurse 
than it did durina: the early davs of life. 

The inculcation of good nursing-habits can not be too strongly 
insisted upon. Many attacks of indigestion, colic, and diarrhea 
may be traced to improper nursing. When good habits are 
once established, there is generally very little trouble, the suc- 
cess of the training depending largely on the manner in which 
it is done. Kegular hours for feeding should be fixed and 
adhered to ; and if the child is asleep at the feeding-hour, it may 
be aroused, for it will almost invariably go to sleep after nurs- 
ing. After the last feeding, which should usually take place 
at or 10 o'clock, the child should be quieted and allowed 
to sleo}) as long as it chooses. 

During the first month or two the infant will, as a rule, 
awaken between 1 or 2 o'clock and again at about 4 or 5 
o'clock. After two or three months it will require but one 
night feeding, and after five months of age the average infant 
will sleep all night without nursing. 

When the cliange is being made and the child awakens for 
its accustomed nursing, it should be given a little warm water 
from a bottle and be quieted, but not taken up. Kegular nursing- 
liabits induce regular bowel movements and sleep, and the three 
combined insure health and comfort not only for the inlant, but 
for the mother as well. A In-althy child, if trained to do so, 
will sleep without rocking or coddling. Three things are, 
however, essential to secure sueee.-s in this training: a satisfied 
appetite, dry na])kins, and a <julet, darkened room. The infant 
must not be nursed each time it cries. If it has colic, the 
warm milk niav soothe the child lor a time, but later aggra-

In case of sickness and when the infant is feeble and below 
the average, especial rules are re(}uired, and directions ,-hould 
be modified to suit each individual case. A good general rule 
is to feed the child according to the age to which the weight 
corresponds. The child\s weight is the l)est index of its niuri- 
tion. During the first four months it mav be weighed twice a 
week; after that time once a week is sufficient. The average 
minimum gain for an infant is four ounces a week. \i the 
weight falls below this for several weeks consecutively, it is evi- 
dent that something is wrong. During illness, of course, there 
mav be no gain or loss accordino' to the severitv of the condition. 

When the breast milk is insufficient for, or unsuited to the 
needs of, the infant, it becomes fretful, colic occurs, and the babe 
appears to be ^^ cross. '^ Disturbanc(\'^ of the alimentary tract, 
diarrhea with greenish stools containing a large amount oi' 
mucus and undigested curds, take place at times. At times the 
stools are brownish, and contain mucus and numerous curds the 
size of a grain of wheat or larger. In other cases there may 
be chronic constipation with small, hard, dry stools. 

If the infant is getting too little milk, it is fretful and gains 
slowly or not at all, but there is rarely any disturbance of" the 
stomach or bowels. In these cases the nursing is contimied for 
over thirty minutes without satisfying the child, or it may nurse 
a minute or two and then refuse to mirse because the supply is 
so scanty. Where the breast milk is nearly normal in (piantity 
and in quality, certain mea.<ures, which w ill i)e discussed further 
on, may be taken to augment the sup])ly and (Mirich the quality, 
or it may be sup{)lemented by artilieial feeding. When the 
milk is very poor in quality, as, for example, when the specific 
gravity is from 1.015 to 1.025 and when only 2 or ."> per cent, 
of cream is present, the child shoidd be weaned at once, for the 
condition is not amenable to treatment. 

Mother's milk may easily be tested by means of Holt's milk

When the mother's milk is found to not agree with the infant, 
it may often be modified by the following means : 

1 . If the milk is too rich, the diet should be limited, espe- 
cially as to the amount of meat taken. All alcoholic and malted 
drinks should be prohibited. With plenty of fresh air and exer- 
cise, such as walking, the desired effect will generally be brought 
about. The exerci.<e should be carried to the point of fatigue. 

2. When the milk is good but deficient in quantity, the 
su])ply may l)e augmented by massage of the breasts three 
times a day for from five to ten minutes. A good malt extract 
may be given with the meals, and fresh air and exercise pre- 
scribed. Sufficient fiuid should be given, preferably milk. 

'). AMien the milk is deficient in quantity and })oor in quality, 
irn))rovement may be brought about by various means : Mas- 
sage, malt, and iron are to be ])rescribed if there is anemia. 
All jdcoholic malt extract combined with })e]Honate of iron or 
of iron and manganese is a good combination, and may be had 
in very ))ahital)le ibrni. The diet should be ample, and contain 
sunicient nitrogenous food. Milk should be taken with the 
meals, (luring tlui intervals between meals, and at bedtime. U 
the milk interi'eres with digestion, as it often does in {\\v>v eases, 
the following mixture may be used with advantage :

.'-poonfid of lime-water and two tables])oonfuls of cream ; then 
fill the glass with w;iter. The lime-water may in many cases

bo omitted and the u^lass merely filled with plain water after the 
addition of the cream. Another essential is fre>h air — driving 
or walking if the mother is str<»ni;- enough. It is vci-v im- 
portant that the mother ol)tain snlUeient rest. During the night 
the child should he cared for by the mn\se, and he given the 
bottle instead of the breast. 

4. When the quantity is sullieient but the <|uality is poor, 
little can be done, and the child must generally be w<>an('(l. 
The foretroinix measures mav be tried, but not for too loiio; ^ 
period, as the child may suffer in consecpienee. 

A moot point is wh(3ther it is wise to allow the child one 
bottle a day as a routine j)ractice. The authors always follow 
this plan after the second month, and where proper preeaiuions 
regarding cleanliness and Pasteurization have been taken, no ill 
results have been seen to follow. The advantages of this 
method are as follows : 

The child learns to take milk from a bottle, and if, owing to 
the illness of the mother, it becomes necessary at any time to 
substitute the bottle, this may be done without much difHculty. 
On the other hand, if the child has taken nothing but the 
breast, it may often refuse the bottle entirely, with disastrous 
results, severe cases of acute inanition having been known to 
follow. This method facilitates weaning. If the mother is weak, 
it allows her to obtain an undisturbed night's rest. Among the 
upper classes the child is often weaned early so that nursing 
may not interfere with the mother's social pleasures and duties. 
If the breast-feeding be supplemented by the bottle, many of 
these Avomen may be induced to nurse their children during the 
greater part of the first year, when they would otherwise give 
it up very early and abandon the child to the care of a nurse. 

2. Wet-nursing. — With the advent of a more thorough 
knowledge of infant feeding wet-nursing has, fortunately, be- 
come less frequent. Nevertheless, there are some infants that 
will thrive on nothing but breast-feeding. When tliis is the case, 
a wet-nurse must be chosen accordiu^: to the following rules : 

The woman should be healthy and of good habits. The 
absence of syphilis, tuberculosis, alc(^holism, and other dis- 
eases should be determined by careful examination. A 
Wassermann test should be made to determine the ])resence 
or absence of syphilis. The nipples should be carefully ex- 
amined for fissures and idceration. The breast should be 
examined before and after nursing, and the milk tested as 
previously described. The size of the l)reast alone is not 
a good guide as to the amount or (piality of the milk it 



254 INFANT FEEDING. 

secretes. The quantity may be judged by the size of the 
breast before and after nursing or by weighing the baby 
before and after nursing. This latter method, although a good 
one, is not usually resorted to. The wet-nurse should always 
be one who has nursed her own ehild successfully for at least a 
month. If ptjssible, she should be a primipara between twenty 
and thirty-fiye years of age. Younger or older women should 
not, as a rule, be employed. If the infant's condition permits, 
the nurse should be giyen at least a week's trial, ibr often the 
change in her mode of living may cause a scanty flow of milk 
or render it otherwise unsatisfactory. AVhen she has become 
accustomed to her surroundings, the milk may become perfectly 
normal. Owning to idleness and a too abundant diet the milk 
may Ijccome too rich. In these cases tlie rules ])reviously laid 
down may correct tlie condition. Suitable wet-nurses are not 
easily obtained, are expensiye, and are often a source of con- 
stant trouble and annoyance. A woman who will give up the 
care of her own child for pay is usually a very unpleasant 
jXTson to have about. For these reasons, except where there is 
severe acute inanition, other means should be tried before a wet- 
nurse is resorted to. Wet-nursing is, however, yery success- 
fully carried out in Germany and some other countries. 

:>. Mixed Feeding. — By this method, as. previously de- 
scribed, the child is fed partly on the l)reast an.d ])artly on the 
bottle. This method is indicated when the mother's milk is 
]>oor or scanty, owing to some intervening illness, or when, 
owing to deficient quantity, the mother can not entirely nurse 
the child ; it is also useful in weaning. M'eaning is accom- 
])lished with less discomibrt to mother and cliild if done gradu- 
ally. If the mother is nursing the child but once or twice a 
day, her milk may become very poor, and ('(^nscfpiently should 
be examined from time to time. In these cases the child is 
usually satisfied after a bottle, })ut not after the breast-feeding. 

Partial Feeding With Human Milk. — It frequently hap- 
pens that a wet nurse caimot be obtained, but nearly always it 
is possible to get one or more nursings from some friendly 
mother. From 1 to G or <S ounces of })reast milk added 
to the diet of the artificially fed child is often the means of 
saving the life of the child — the bn^ast milk stimulating the 
nutrition as nothing else will. In cities such milk can often be 
bought at maternity hosj.itals by mal:ing special arrangements, 
and a similar })lan may be successfully followed apart from 
hospitals. In premature, improperly fe(l young iufants, in- 



ARTIFICIAL OR JIOTTLE FIJFDiya. 255 

anition, marasmus, and in some other conditions this ])hin is of 
great value. 

4. Artificial or Bottle Feeding. — if a ])al)y cannot he 
nursed at the breast, how can it he ied so as to have it ^^row 
into a strong, healthy, normal child? Thi^ (|U('stion has been 
the object of a great deal of study, and while nuich has been 
learned about infant feeding, it would seem that thci-e is much 
more to fmd out. The earlier methods of modifying milk con- 
sisted of mixing mixtures of water and milk, then sugar and 
water were added, and then cereal gruels with or without sugar. 
Buttermilk mixtures w-ere used in some ])laccs. Li( big tried to 
get a mixture to add to milk to ada])t it to the ini'ant's diiics- 
tion. ]>iedert and ^Nleigs suggested mixtures to replace 
mothers' milk, and Rotch elaborated their ideas and sugnc-tcd 
the study of milk mixtures from the standpoint of the pei'centage 
of protein, fat, and carbohydrate contained. Jiudin and others 
suggested undiluted cows' milk, lleubner approached the sub- 
ject from the standpoint of the energy rccjulred })y the inl'ant, 
and suggested mixtures Avhich in proper amounts coxered the 
number of calories needed. 

In practice it was found that sometimes milk not only 
did not agree, but at times caused positive injury. Seeking 
the explanation for this, Biedert suggested that the |)rotein or 
curd w\as at fault. Later, Czerny thought the trouble was due 
to the fats, especially if given in too great quantities. He 
believed that the large quantities of fat used up too nuich of the 
alkali in the intestine in sa])onifying it, and so brought about 
a condition of acidosis and of gastro-intestinal disturbance. 
Later, Finkelstein and his school taught that the sugars were 
the cause of the trouble. His theories are considered somewhat 
more fully below. Still others believe that the diderence in 
the character and amounts of the inorganic salts are responsiI)le 
for the trouble in feeding. The bacteriologists iwv of the opinion 
that bacteria are the cause of the trouble, and at times the dis- 
turbance is due to the toxic disturbances which the bacteria 
cause to be formed in the milk. Still others blame the diif(T- 
ence in ferments and other specific characters of the milk, claim- 
ing that these specific differences in the milk of various animals 
are at the bottom of the trouble. Again, the quantities, the 
hours, and methods generally have been blamed. Sometimes 
one of these things is the cause and sometimes another. 

The Problem of Infant Feeding. — This may be approached 
much in the same manner as the feeding of adults. We shall 



256 INFANT FEEDING. 

take up first certain theoretic considerations and then the prac- 
tical application. 

The Caloric Xeeds of Infants. — The total caloric needs of 
infants have not been definitely determined^ and infant feeding 
can be done successfully without any knowledge of calories. 
However true this may be, the study of infant feeding from a 
standpoint of the caloric needs adds greatly to its interest, and 
is a valuable check on under- and overfeeding. It must be 
borne in mind that the food must not only contain the requisite 
number of calories, but it must be digestible, absorbable, and 
ca])able of being utilized by the baby without causing any 
untoward symptoms, i'inkelstein observed that the average 
breast-fed infant draws daily during the first week of life one- 
fifth of its body-weight ; from the sixth week to the sixth month, 
one-sixth to one-seventh, and during the latter half of the first 
year, one-eighth of its body-weight. Expressed in round 
numbers {)er kilo of body-weight, during the first three months 
it receives 150 c.c, during the second period somewhat less, 
and during the third period 120 to 1-jO c.c. Ex])ressed in 
Heubner's energy quotient — that is, in calories per kilo of bodv- 
weight — the re(|uirement during the first three months is 100 
calories per kilo (45.4 calories per })()und), during the second 
three months between 100 and 90 (40.9 calories per pound), and 
during the latter half of the first year 80 or a little less per 
kilo (36.4 calories per pound). Artificially fed children are 
supposed by some to need more than breast-fed children on 
account of the supposed greater work required in assimilating 
cowls' milk. Heubner suggests ll2(J calories per kilo. The 
other figures, however, seem to cover the needs of healthy 
infants as demonstrated in })ractice. The needs of older 
children have been given under Age and Food Requirements. 

The requirements vary gi-eatly under different conditions. 
Thus, an infant that sleeps a great deal will require less food 
than one who is wakeful, and the high-strung, nervous, very 
active child requires considerably niorc than either. The reason 
a child requires so much more ])er kilo of weight than an adult 
depends largely on the fact that the propoition of surface is 
greater in the small body. A certain amount is neeeled for 
growth, as it has been variously e>ti mated that from 9 to 15 
|)er cent, of the fi)od taken was retained for the purpose of 
forming new tissue. 

Atrophic children and those under weight for their age re- 
(piire more per kilo than the normal child. Some observers 



ARTIFICIAL OR BOTTLE FEEDING. 257 

have fed as high as 170 calories per kilo in order to secure a 
proper gain in weight. Such feeding should only be done when 
under very careful supervision, as excessive (quantities of food 
are liable to cause digestive disturl)ances. 

Caloric Need of Premature Infants. — I less and others have 
studied this question, and believe that ])reniature infants re(|uire 
more food proportionately than the full-term baby. The need 
varies inversely with age and birth weight. From practical 
observation those babies weighing over 1500 grams at birth 
require from 100 to 132 calories ])er kilo of body-weight ; 
those weighing under 1500 grams, from 115 to 170. Tliese 
doubtless vary greatly, and such high caloric feeding should not 
be attempted at first, but the amounts should be small, and in- 
creased as the infant's digestion warrants it. The milk should 
not be given until after the first bowel movement. Mothers' 
milk only should be used for these infants, and every effort 
should be made to secure it. The first day Hess suggests 
diluting the breast milk with 1 to 2 parts of water, and adding 
sugar to make up for this dilution. Mothers' milk has been 
variously estimated at from 650 to 700 calories per liter, or 
about 22 calories per ounce. About 30 calories should be 
given, or about IJ ounces of mothers' milk diluted with water. 
If there is no vomiting and no indigestion, 10 calories a 
day may be added — that is, about J ounce of mothers' milk. 
If there is any digestive disturbance, the increase need not 
be made for a day or two or more. The amount of water 
to be given may be estimated at about one-sixth of the 
body-weight a day. The milk may be diluted with about an 
equal quantity of water, or 3 to 3 J per cent, sugar of milk 
solution, and the remainder of the water given between feedings. 
After ten to fifteen days' infants under 1500 grams should be 
held at about 120 to 140 calories per kilo, and those over 1500, 
at from 110 to 130. These amounts may be varied with the 
condition of the stools and the weierht. The milk or water mav 
be given from a bottle by means of the Breck feeder or by 
using a catheter, according to the vitality of the infant. Occa- 
sionally the breast may be given directly. The great })roba- 
bility of syphilis in foster children should always be borne in 
mind. 

Budin^s rule as to the quantity of milk to be given in twenty- 
four hours is to feed one-fifth the body-weight, or multiply the 
body-weight by 2 and feed one-tenth that amount. Budin's 
figures are a little lower than Hess', owing to the fact that he 



258 INFANT FEEDING. 

used 650 calories per liter, while Hess estimates 700 calories 
per liter. 

The Determination of the Caloric Value of Modi- 
fied Milk. — Moorebouse has given a very simple method for 
estimating the caloric value of infants' food when the total quan- 
tity of the percentage formula is known. The method is as fol- 
lows : Reduce the twenty-four hour amount to cubic centimeters, 
one ounce being equal to 29.5 c.c. Xext determine the number 
of grams of fat, sugar, and protein in the mixture by multi- 
plying the number of cubic centimeters and the daily amount 
by the percentages of fat, sugar, and protein. The calories 
from each constituent may be determined by remembering that 
a gram of fat furnishes 9.3 calories, and a gram of sugar or ])ro- 
tein furnishes 4.1 calories. The calculation may be sim])lified 
by expressing the arithmetical ])rocess by equations, thus : 
Calories from fat equal Q x F x 2.74 ; calories from sugar and 
protein equal Q x (S + P) x 1.21. The sum of these two values 
gives the total calories furnished by the mixture, and this figure 
divided by the weight of the child in pounds gives the calories 
]x,'r ])()und per day. In the above formula (^ equals the twenty- 
i'our-hour amount in ounces, F, 8, and P the percentages of fat, 
sugar, and protein expressed as whole numbers ; ibr example, 1 
per cent, equals 1 and not 0.01. 

Fraley's Method. — This is not strictly accurate, but suffi-* 
ciontly so for all practical purposes. In calculating milk mix- 
tures he uses the following fornuila : 

2F + P + S X 11 Q -= Calories, 

or twice the fat percentage plus the ])rotein percentage, and the 
sugar percentage multij)lied by 1| times the total quantity gives 
a{)proximately the number of calories. For example — 

1*') per cent, cream 2 ounces. 

Milk 14 "

This gives, by I^auer's method, fat 2.75, protein 2, and

A simpler inethod Is to know the ealoric value of eoniriion 
foods. Mothers' milk is estimated at i'rom ()")() to TOO oalori(!S 
per liter, or about 22 calories j)er ounce. Cows' milk is orcncr- 
allv estimated at 20 calories per ounce for market (4 pe-r cent, 
fat) milk. Holt estimates the food values as follows :

Budin's Simple Rule. — This is easily i-emembcred — one- 
tenth the body-wx'iii:ht in twenty-four hours. If the body- 
weight is 10 pounds, it will require 1 pound or ] pint of milk 
in twenty-four hours, or from 1^ to IJ oiuices ol' milk jxr 
pouud of body-weight. This is a little under the figure given 
above, but the sugar, generally added, brings it u]) to the re- 
quired amoimt. 

Protein Requirements. — From the data at hand one 
canuot at this time state what is the best amoinit to be used 
under various conditions. Rowland is of the opinion that from 
8 to 10 })er cent, of the total calories should come tVom the 
protein, li' it runs nuich below 8 })er cent., there is not sutli- 
cient for growth, and if it runs uuich over, the specitie dynamic 
action of the protein becomes manifest. 

The dangers of feeding too little ])roteiu are anemia and no 
gain in weight or too small a gain. It has ])cvn abundantly 
])roved that young animals fed on a diet low in ])rotein do not 
develop either in size or strength as well as those fed on diets 
containing sufficient ])rotein. 

Fat and Carbohydrate Requirements. — The differ- 
ence in the food must, of course, be made up of fat and carbo- 
hydrate. The best results are obtained by using both fat and 
carbohydrates. In average healthy infants about 10 per cent. 



260 INFANT FEEDING. 

of the total calories requirement will be supplied as protein, 
and of the remaining 90 per cent, of the calories about 50 per 
cent, may be advantageously given as fat and the remaining 40 
per cent, as carbohydrate. 

One must bear in mind that the ultin^ate aim is to feed 
the baby successfully, and infant feeding should not be re- 
garded in the light of a mathematic game. These figures 
are based on successful feeding carried on at first without 
any regard for calories. The expression of results in calories 
will, however, be found both mteresting and useful. To avoid 
repetition the remainder of this subject will be considered 
below under the heading of Percentage of Fat and Carbo- 
hydrate. 

Mineral Salts. — Of late these have come in for consider- 
able attention, and many disorders of nutrition are supposed to 
be due to disturbances in the equilibrium or balance of the 
various mineral constituents in the body. At present our 
knowledge is a little too vague to permit any very definite rules, 
but a diet low in inorganic constituents should not be given a 
growing child. It seems that, just as in the case of nitrogen, 
balances may be fixed at various levels ; that is, if the diet 
is rich in salts a large amount is excreted, and if it is poor in 
salts, less. Below a certain level it is not well to go (see Salts). 
The salts are important in building up the tissues. Calcium 
phosphate and magnesium are most important. 

These salts are present in sufficient quantities in mothers^ 
milk and in cows' milk. In modifying cows' milk, reducing 
the j^rotein reduces the calcium to the correct amount ; but such 
dilution reduces the magnesium and the iron below the normal 
requirements. 

Tlie iron in the food given most infants is too low ; but the 
ill elfects are not seen, as a rule, as the baby starts off with an 
excess of iron. If exclusiv^e milk feeding is kept up too long, 
anemia results, as is often seen in infants from one and a half 
to tliree years. Iron may l)e supplied best in yolk of e^^i:^ or 
in meats, or it may be given in one of tlie usual forms. ^I^ig- 
ne.-ium may be sup})lied by using legume flours or wheat prep- 
arations. Vegetal)le broths an^ rich in salts. Lists showing 
th(3 .-alt-content of various foods will be found und(4' the head- 
ing of Salts. 

Calories and Percentages. — There has l)een a great deal 
said al)out tlie caloric method of feeding and the ])ercentage 
m<thod. These are not methods of feeding, but methods of 



ARTIFICIAL OB BOTTLE FEEDING. 261 

expressing what is being done, and their nse sliould make the 
})roblem more clear. Tlie caloric vahie of foods is im])ortjint, 
as it enables one to estimate whether llie baby is getting in- 
sufficient food or too much before signs of actual trouble occur. 
The })ercentage method of deaUug with the subject is vahiable 
because it gives us a metiiod ol' expressing acein-ately and con- 
cisely what the baby is getting. It gives us a basi> ibr chang- 
ing the composition of tlie food to suit the needs of the indi- 
vidual infant. 

Tolerance for Food. — The success or faihire of the pliv-ician 
will depend largely on his ability to adai)t food to the digestive 
capacity of the individual infant. One njight sav that every 
baby is more or less like every other baby. For infant feeding 
one might more truthfully state that every baby is more or less 
different. The differences are not always a})parent, because 
there is a rather wide range in which the average baby will 
thrive. That is, it is capable of growing under more or le.-s 
adverse circumstances, and of utilizing more or less inipr(>])er 
foods. These variations have definite limits in both directions 
as regards the composition and amount of foods. Within the 
limitations the baby thrives ; if the limit is overstepped the 
infant becomes ill. Babies living in the country, out of doors, 
often have wide limits of tolerance. The dweller in the over- 
heated, under-ventilated city flat usually has narrow^ f)od limi- 
tations. Disease changes the tolerance for food often in a re- 
markable way. Foods of a composition and quantity which 
ordinarily agree very well may actually cause disease when 
given in certain diseased conditions. Lactose, for example, 
in normal babies is assimilated readily, but if the intestine 
becomes damaged it may be the cause of a rather definite 
disturbance of metabolism, which has been descril)ed as sugar- 
poisoning. 

It is not possible to modify the food to suit all the differences 
of metabolism and constitution. AVe cannot always tell what 
the trouble is wdien we know there is something wrong, but we 
can, by keeping within certain limits, prevent much trouble, 
and careful study and experiment often corrects existing dis- 
turbances. 

The Composition of Milk. — In the United States the 
only milk which is available for infant feeding is that from the 
cow. To insure success in infant feeding, one should know its 
composition, how it compares to mothers' milk, and how to 
modify it to suit it to the individual infant. 



262 INFANT FEEDING. 

Comparison of mothers' milk and cows' milk : 

Average woman. Average cow. 

Protein 1.50 3.50 

Fat 3.50 4.00 

Sugar 7.00 4.50 

Salts 0.20 0.75 

Water 87.80 87.25 

100.00 100.00 

In the first place there are differences which are not apparent. 
Women's milk contains ferments which stimulate the dip^estive 
secretions in the child. Those of cows' milk stimulate the 
digestion of the calf, not of the infant. In some difficult cases 
even a small amount of women's milk will be found of great 
service in stimulating the digestion. 

The Protein. — This differs both in amount and in character. 
In women's milk the proteins consist of lactalbumin and casein 
in the proportion of two-thirds of the former to one-third of the 
latter. In cows' milk about one-sixth of the protein is lactal- 
bumin and the remainder casein. The total protein in human 
milk precipitates in fine flakes, that of cows' milk in heavy 
curds. The modification of the protein consists in diluting the 
milk until the protein is from O.G per cent, or more, according 
to the age, size, and digestive capacity of the infant. In some 
cases tlie lactalbumin and curd may be separated and added in 
the required amounts. 

Tlie ])rotein may be prevented from forming large curds by 
the addition of lime-water, sodium citrate, barley, or oaimcal- 
water. With tlie smaller percentage this is not necessary. 

Sii.r/((r. — Milk-sugar or lactose is present in a very constant 
proportion in mothers' milk — from 6 to 7 per cent. In cows' 
milk the sugar averages about 4.50 per cent. Diluting cows' 
milk reduces tlie sugar still farther, so that sugar nuist be 
added to make up the percentage. This is not added to 
sweeten the milk, l)ut to increase its food value. During the 
first few days of life sugar may be given in the proportion of 
0.0 to 5.") per cent.; from the second week to the third month, 
G })('!• cent.; and from that time up to the eleventh month, 7 
per rent, may be used. At the eleventh month it may be 
reduced to o^ and a little later omitted altogether, unless the 
child is und(T weight. These are safe limits, both from the 
standpoint of mitrition and tolerance. Some infants will tol- 
erate more than 7 ))er cent., but there is no advantage in giving 
more, and it may give rise to syni])toms of sugar-poisoning. 

There has been a L^c^at deal of discussion about the kind of 



ARTIFICIAL OR BOTTLE FKKDIXG. 203 

sugar to be used. Lactose, the suo^ar found in milk, is hest for 
normal infants. It may be given in sullicieiit amounts more 
easily than the other sugars, as it is not so sweet. Care sliould 
be taken to get a ])ui'e sugar. ]\Iilk-sugar may cause troubles 
if there is digestive distiu'bance, even in the amounts men- 
tioned above, and one of the other sugars or other carbo- 
hydrate (as starch) may then be substituted. In the severe 
diarrheas the starch foods (as barley or rice gruel) are Ix'tter 
borne. 

Cane-sugar is cheaper and often substituted ibr lactose in 
ordinary feeding, but it is so sweet that only about half as nmch 
can be used. In some cases it is apparently digested better 
than lactose. 

Maltose is much used at present in place of the above. It 
is generally given in mixtures containing dextrose as well. If 
maltose is used, it should be begun in small quantities and 
increased to the desired quantity, as it sometimes causes 
diarrhea and other disturbances, particularly if any gastro- 
intestinal trouble exists. In such cases it should be used with 
great care. It ferments very easily. It has the advantage of 
being readily assimilated, as is especially indicated in loss of 
weight or stationary weight without apparent cause. 

The following is said to be the composition of some of the 
most frequently used preparations containing them : 

Maltose. Dextrose.

Other analyses of infants' foods containing maltose and dex- 
trose will be found under the heading of Proprietary Foods. 

Glucose solutions are sometimes used by the drop method by 
rectum, either with or without salt solution. (See Keetal 
Feeding.) 

The subject of the different sugars in relation to the various 
intestinal disturbances needs further study. (See also Finkel- 
stein's theories.) 

Fat. — The fat of human milk averages 4 per cent.; that of 
cows' milk is the same. When the milk has been diluted, the 
amount must either be made up by adding cream or by using 
the upper one-third or upper half of the milk after the cream 



264 INFANT FEEDING. 

has risen. Gravity cream contains about twice as many bacte- 
ria as centrifugal cream, and the objections formerly urged 
against the latter appear to be unfounded. 

The amount of fat to be given varies with the age, weight, 
and digestive ability of the infant. For an average infant, 2 
per cent, the first week, 2.5 per cent, the second, and 3 per 
cent, the third week are the amounts usually prescribed. At 
four months the amount may be increased to 4 per cent. ; after 
that time this amount must not be exceeded, or the infant is 
apt to develop indigestion, with the large whitish stools giving 
oiF the characteristic odor of the fatty acids. 

The Calculation of Percentagfes in Milk Mixtures. 
— This is needed if one thinks in percentages, and a simple 
rule is given by Holt as follows : To determine the percentage 
of any constituent in the food, multiply its percentage in the 
original milk, cream, or milk by the number of ounces of each 
in the food, and divide by the total number of ounces of food 
prepared. 

For example, a 40-ounce mixture, made up of 20 ounces of 
the upper half of market (4 per cent.) milk; that is, of 7 per 
cent, milk, 20 ounces of water, and IJ ounces milk-sugar: 

7 X 20 =:^^ 140 represents fat in mixture, 
1 40 H- 40 = 3.5 percentage. 

The protein in 7 per cent, milk is about 3.50 per cent. : 

3.50 X 20 = 70 represents protein in mixture, 
70 -=- 40 = 1.75 percentage of protein. 

The sugar in a 7 per cent, milk is about 4.50 per cent. : 

4.50 X 20 = 90 represents sugar in milk, 
90 -^ 40 = 2.25 percentage of sugar in milk. 

1 ?, ounces of milk-sugar in 20 ounces adds about 3.75 
(f.5 -- 40 = 0.0375). The total sugar is 2.25 -f .375 = 6 
per cent. 

The Principles of Modifying Milk. — Having consid- 
ered the caloric needs of infants and the percentages of food 
constituents [ordinarily employed, we may take up briefly some 
of the reasons for modifying milk with reference to the diges- 
tion of the infant. It should be borne in mind that the gastro- 
intestinal tract of the infant is not like that of an adult. At birth 
the digestive capacity is small, and it increases as the child 



ARTIFICIAL OR BOTTLE FEEDING, 265 

grows, providing pro])or food is given. The steps in the diges- 
tion of milk are, first, the rennet ehanges the ealeiurn casein of 
the milk into paracasein (curd), which is not atfected by pe})sin. 
Then the acid of the stomach unites with the lime of tlic para- 
casein, forming a free ])aracasein curd, whi(;h is more dense than 
the paracasein, but which is ca})al)le of being digested by ])e})sin. 
This free paracasein curd acts like a base and unites with the 
acid, forming a paracasein chlorid, wdiich is also digestibh; bv 
pepsin. If milk is diluted with plain water, the rennet acts 
promptly and the clotting occurs in a normal manner. M'omen's 
milk clots in small curds, but cows' milk in large dense ones, 
so that alkalis are often added for the ])urpose of cheeking or 
altering the curd formation. The most used substances are 
lime water and sodium bicarbonate. Lime-water is freely alka- 
line and makes the clotting take place more slowly, alters the 
form of the curd, making it looser, and ])robably a certain 
amount of the milk passes into the intestine without having 
been much changed in the stomach. 

When sodium bicarbonate is used, its greater alkaline pro})er- 
ties prevent not only the action of the rennet, but the pepsin 
and acid as well, until the alkali is neutralized. This probably 
causes gastric digestion to be small in amount and the work 
falls on the intestine. It is thought that fluid milk passes rap- 
idly into the intestine, whereas if it clots it remains until di- 
gested. It has been estimated that adding 5 per cent, lime- 
water to milk will render it alkaline, whereas 20 per cent, will 
check the digestion of protein in the stomach entirely. AVith 
sodium bicarbonate 1 grain to the ounce renders the milk 
alkaline, 2 grains to the ounce facilitates the gastric diges- 
tion of protein by changing the character of the curd, 
while 8 grains to the ounce will suspend the gastric digestion 
of protein. 

As generally practised, 5 per cent, of lime-water is added to a 
milk mixture, regardless of the actual amount of milk in the 
mixture. When the mixture is a weak one the effect is very 
marked, as there is but little milk to be affected, but in the 
stronger mixtures the effect is less marked. 

The tables prepared by Southworth are interesting in this 
connection. 

Taking the 20-ounce mixture as an illustration, if the milk 
to be used is first rendered alkaline by the addition of 5 
per cent, lime-water or 1 grain of sodium bicarbonate to each 
ounce of milk, and this is diluted to make the feeding mixture,

In youno; infants and in those with feel)le digestions tlie use 
of alkalis is a great help. We rarely use over 1 ounce of 
lime-water in 'J()-oun(»e mixtures f )r healthy infants. Theoret- 
ically and practically lime-water is the best and safest. Milk to 
which lime-water is added should not be boiled, as the lime is 
pr('('i])itated at the higher temjx'ratures. 

Oilier alkalis may be us(m1, as syrup of lime of magnesia. 
Potassium carbonate or borax have been suirgested. The con- 
tinued u-e of strong alkalis is not to be commended, as it re- 
tards development. 

Tlie clotting may l)e changed meeham'cally by adding a gruel 
made by barley Hour or other eei-e;ils. It is sometimes an ad- 
vantaire to dextrinize the gruel to i-endei- it mon^ digestible. 

lioiling milk is sonietitnes practised in order to change the 



ARTIFICIAL OR BOTTLE FEEDING. 267 

curd. Boiled milk is often useful where there is a tendeiiev to 
frequent stools. In some ehildren it produees marked consti- 
pation. 

Acid milk, as buttermilk or kumiss and simihir ])r('j)arations, 
are often used when ordinary milk mixtures are not well hornc 
The protein is precipitated in line curds and is easily di^estcii, 
as the digestive juices can affect it easily and the rennet does 
not cause further clotting. 

Still another method of getting at the (picstion of large cunl^ 
is by adding sodium citrate to the milk. From 1 to .'> grams 
to each ounce of milk in the mixture may be w^vd. The soda 
forms a compound with the casein, and the citric acid unites 
with the calcium, forming calcium citrate. This ])revents elnt- 
tino;, and we have found this useful in u'ivinir the hiiiher iter- 
centages of protein to children with weak digestions, and also 
in infants who are troubled \vith mild forms of constipation. 

Practical Infant Feeding*. — Having considered the more 
important princi})les on which infant feeding is basetl, we are 
in a position to consider it practically. 

Fare Milk Essential. — It should be borne in mind that pure, 
clean milk is essential to infant feeding. This has been con- 
sidered in the article on Milk. The ])erson caring for the 
child should be careftdly instructed on this ])oint, and the milk 
selected should be the best obtainable. It is always cheapest 
in the end. Careful instruction should also be giv(Mi about 
keeping the milk cold, about sterilizing the bottles and all the 
utensils that are used in the preparation of the babies' milk, so 
as to avoid C(uitaminating it. If very pure milk is ()l)tainable, 
it may be used raw, if there is any doubt, it should be })asteur- 
ized (see Milk), and if it is very doubtful, it should be sterilized 
by boiling. We do not believe that milk that needs boiling 
(unless to keep it in the absence of ice) is fit f >r infant feeding ; 
but in spite of all that can be done some people will use it. 

It is a good plan to test the milk occasionally to ascertain 
the fat-content. 

The directions for preparing the food should be written out, 
showing the quantity of each ingredient, the number and size 
of feeding, etc. Always make certain that the directions are 
clearly understood. 

Bottled MiUz and Bacteria. — Hess has found that the bacteria 
are far more numerous in the upper layers of the cream, and 
that they become gradually fewer in its low^er j^cn-tion. The 
upper 2 ounces of the cream contain the greatest muiiber of 
bacteria, and this is true of the tubercle bacilli, as well as of 



268 INFANT FEEDING. 

the streptococci and other bacteria. He suggests that ic place 
of using the upper cream, as ordinarily practised, it is 
better to discard the upper two ounces. The average bottle of 
such partially skimmed milk contains 2 per cent, of fat and 3.5 
per cent, of protein. The top 7 ounces of what remains in the 
bottle contain 12 per cent, of fat, 8 ounces of 10 per cent, fat, 
and 12 ounces of 7 per cent. fat. These portions of the milk 
may be used in the ordinary percentage mixtures. 

Substitutes for Milk. — If pure milk cannot be obtained, 
we prefer temporary feeding with condensed milk mixtures, 
malted milk, dried milk, or sometimes buttermilk. When the 
former are used it is always wise to give the baby a few tea- 
spoonfuls of orange-juice daily, or every other day, to prevent 
scurvy. If the above foods are to be used for any length of 
time, fat should be supplied, and if pure cream cannot be ob- 
tained, olive oil may be used. 

The Interval for Feeding. — The schedule for feeding 
is given under Maternal Nursing and also the Laboratory 
Method. There is wide difference of opinion concerning the 
proper interval. At present the swing of the pendulum is to 
very long intervals. It depends on the individual baby. The 
interval and the size of the feeding are closely related. The 
amount of food needed in twenty-four hours should be divided 
into the number decided upon according to the size of the 
feeding, and that is settled by the age and size of the bal)y. 
Normal babies may be given the food every two hours during 
the first month. During the second and third months the 
interval may l)e made two and a half hours, and then three, 
until tlie end of the first year. If the baby is large, the three- 
hour interval may be used sooner, if small, a little later. Four- 
hour intervals may be used if very strong milk mixtures are 
used or in feeding undiluted milk. Long intervals are also 
useful in atony of the stomach and when the gastric digestion 
is weak. In infants who are very small the interval may be 
shorter, and during illness, when only a s]X)onful or two of food 
can be given at a time, the interval may also be shortened. 
Regular feeding is very imjiortant. During the day the baby 
should be fed on schedule whether it is awake or not, as it will 
otherwise wake at night for the bottle it has missed. Night 
feeding should be omitted as early ;is possible. If sufficient 
food is given during the day, the baby may be allowed to sleep 
all night if it will. Normal l)abies do not need the night 
f(;edijig after the fifth month, and it can often be dispensed with 
after the third. Small l)abies and atrophic ones need the full 



ARTIFICIAL OR BOTTLE FEEDING. 



269 



number of feedings, as they require more milk to make thoin 
gain. 

The Quantity. — The total quantity of mixture to be given 
depends on the size and age. A normal 7-pound bai)y may 
take ten feedings of 2 ounces each, or 20 ounces. We increase! 
the quantity 4 ounces at a time, as a rule. As a general thing we 
increase the strength of the mixture, the quantity alternately, but 
these are exceptions to this. The size of each feeding will 
depend on the baby. . Babies of average weight for their size 
may usually be given the following sized findings :

The above figures are approximate, and may usually be ex-

and much more in atrophic infants. Babies ahead of the 
schedule in weight require correspondingly large feedings. 

The following figures of Ladd are of great interest, as they

270 INFANT FEEDING. 

The regulation of the size of the feeding is important. The 
stomach in an elastic bag, and what might be regarded as a 
normal capacity varies within certain limits. If too much is 
given at a feeding, some of it will be regurgitated soon after. 
(See Vomiting.) 

When this, is the case, the size of the feeding should be re- 
duced. Infants improperly fed are usually hungry all the time, 
and take readily almost any amount, merely to regurgitate it 
soon after. It is a common mistake to give these babies too 
large feedings. Only as much as can be retained should be 
given. These l)abies usually have atonic stomachs from taking 
feedings that are too large. At first the feedings in these cases 
should be small and the interval long. Strychnin in proper 
doses is of great value in these infants. The size of the feed- 
ing and the interval should be a])})r<)ached to the normal average 
as rapidly as ])ossible, but the individual requirements should 
never be lost sight of. 

S,-nitkin, of St. Petersburg, has estimated the amount to be 
fed to a child according to the weight. He ascertained that a 
baby's stomach held about one-hundredth of its weight at 
l)irth, and that the increase amounted to about a gram a day. 
By taking one-hundredth of the initial weight at birth and 
adding a grain for each day the average amount required for 
each feeding is ascertained. This is a fair working rule, but 
])ractically the amount is easily determined by the methods 
already described. 

Beginning Bottle Feeding. — When the baby is weaned 
it shoidd be done gradually if jxtssible, as this gives the di- 
gestive organs an opportunity to become accustomed to the 
new milk gradually. The digestive juices are secreted as 
needed, and the stimulus comes from the food. Some- 
times, if au entirely diflierent food is substituted suddenly, 
the digestive juices are not equal to the demand and indiges- 
tion results. 

To avoid this, all the food elements should be begun 
v<'ry low. The first day half the required strength, the 
sc('(»iid (l;iy somewhat stronger, and so on eacli day until 
the proper food is reached. Some babies will take only a 
day or two to make the change, others will re(|uire a week 
or more. 

The aim should })e to produce a firm, healthy looking baby, 
and not a fat, fiabbv one. The foods should b(! increased as 



MILK MODIFICATION. 271 

indicated, keeping in mind the ])resence or iihsencc of" vomit- 
ing, the number and eharaeter of the stools, tlie gain in 
weight, and the general a|)})ea ranee. A ha by that does 
not h:»ok well and contented has something that needs cor- 
rection. It may be in the food or in the general surrounding- 
or care. 

If the baby is getting along well, it gains in weight follow- 
ing approximately the normal weight curve. It >leep> well, 
and is happy and looks contented. The stools are normal 
and there is no vomiting. If the baby is not doing well, the 
picture is just the reverse. There is little or no gain, and 
the child looks pale or flabby and unhajipy. There is usually 
fretting, crying, restless, disturbed sleep, often vomiting, and 
bad stools. 



MILK MODIFICATION* 

METHODS OF PRACTICAL VALUE IN MODIFYING MILK. 

There are a number of methods of milk moditication that 
may be used with good results in the artificial feeding of infants. 
It is not possible for the average practitinner to be familiar with 
all these methods. It is very desirable tnat one method be mas- 
tered, and the best results will be obtained l)y the thorough 
study of tiie method which will suit the ability of the ])hysieian 
and the conditions under which lie has to lal)or. \\'e warn 
against the beginner trying to use two or more methods before 
he is familiar with one. 

The methods most in use are as follows : 

1. The laboratory method is used when a milk laboratory is 
available. Such laboratories are found in the lai-ger towns and 
in hospitals. 

2. Holt's percentage method is satisfactory. It re(piires the 
table, wdiich is a disadvantage. 

3. Holt's top-milk method is our ])reference, as it supplies 
sufiicient formulae for all practical ])urposes, and it is econom- 
ical as regards the use of the milk, and owing to the relation 
existing between the amounts of milk and the fat and protein 
percentages the table can be easily memorized or reproduced by 
remembering only a few facts. 

4. Coit's decimal svstem.

8. Baner's method, 

9. According to Louis Starr's tables. 

10. Chapin's method. 

1. lyaboratory Feeding. — In cities the best substitute 
for breast-feeding is furnished by milk laboratories, where modi- 
fications are made according to the physician's prescription. 
The AValker-Gordon laboratories, now established in many 
cities, supply an ideally clean milk, unsterilized, pasteurized, 
or sterilized at any temperature desired. The milk is supplied 
in nursing-bottles, each bottle holding enough for one feeding 
and being ready for use. Beyond warming the bottle and 
putting on a nipple no furtlier preparation is necessary. In 
winter the milk is delivered in baskets, and in summer in small 
refrigemtors. When economy must be practised, the milk may 
be obtained in larger jars and divided into the requisite number 
of feedings by the mother or nurse. Blank forms on which to 
write prescriptions are furnished physicians. The following 
is an example of such a prescription :

Recently other modifications have been made by means of 
whey. The whey is obtained by adding rennln to the milk, or 
Falrchild's Essence of Pepsin may be Ui^ed. It should be heated 
to loO° F. for five minutes before being added to the milk 
mixture, in order to destroy the enzyme in the milk and so 
prevent coagulation of the casein. When whey is ordered, the 
protein constituent is indicated in the prescription, for example, 
as follows :

In order to obtain satisfactory resnlts the subject oi" labora- 
tory feeding must be thoroughly studied. The authors have 
adopted Holt's scheme of having weekly reports made (ui all 
artificially fed infants and on many others. Thc.-c i-cports are 
supplied in blank form, in pads, to the mother, who fills out 
one each week and sends it to the ])hysician. By thi> method 
part of the responsibility is placed on the mother, and the physi- 
cian is kept informed as to the infant's condition and m^Mllc^.s 
visits are thus obviated. The following^ is a specimen of such 
form :

The quantity should be increased half an ounce or an ounce 
at a time. Later, as the chikFs appetite grows stronger, — that 
is, when he seems dissatisfied after his bottle, — the (juality is 
raised. The fat may usually be increased O.o per cent, at a 
time; the sugar, 0.5 to 1 per cent, at a time; the protein-, from 
0.1 to 0.25 per cent, at a time. Strong, healthy, large l)a])ies 
require more and richer milk than those of frailer constitution. 

What is known as nursery milk is also supplied. This is 
from a selected herd of cattle whose milk contains the l-it in 
very small globules. This is said to be more easily dige.-ted, 
especially by weak infants. 

2. Holt's Percentage Milk Method. — Holt has de- 
vised two methods of modifying milk w^hich are very useful. 
The following method at first sight looks very complicated, but 
it is not, and it permits of great numbers of reasonably exart 
formula?. The first step is to obtain milks containing definite 
amounts of fat from 7 per cent, down to 1 per cent. Ordinary 
market milk from mixed herds averages 4 per cent., milk iVom 
Jersey's and Alderneys, 5 per cent, or more. 

Uniform results may be obtained by having patients use milk 
from one dairy or by having them buy milk containing a certain 
percentage of fat from milk laboratories. 



278 INFANT FEEDING. 

For convenience the formulae are calculated for 20-ounce 
mixtures. 

Every ounce of 7 per cent, milk in 20-oz. mixture has one-twentieth of 7, 

(jr 0.35 per cent. fat. 
Eveiy (junce of 6 per cent, milk in 20-oz. mixture has one-twentieth of 6, 

or 0.30 per cent. fat. 
p]very ounce of 5 per cent, milk in 20-oz. mixture has one-twentieth of 5, 

or 0.25 per cent. fat. 
Every ounce of 1 per cent, milk in 20-oz. mixture has one-twentieth of 

0.05 per cent. fat. 

The variations in protein and sugar need not be considered. 
Four per cent, milk contains 4.50 })er cent, sugar and 3.50 per 
cent. ])rotein, so each ounce of 4 per cent, milk in any of the 
formulae in a 20-ounce mixture will contain one-twentieth or 
0.225 per cent, sugar and 0.175 per cent. ])rotein. 

The tables from Holt (p. 279) show the variations that may 
easily be obtained. To raise the fat without the protein, use a 
milk of a higher fat percentage. To raise the })rotein and not 
the fat, use more ounces of the same milk, or even of a weaker 
one if need be. 

The necessary sugar is added, remembering that each ounce 
of milk-sugar by weight in a 20-ounce mixture increases the 
sugar 5 per cent., or each ounce by volume about '-^ })er cent., 
and that each level tablespoonful in a 20-ounce mixture increases 
the sugar al)out 1.75 })er cent. 

These formulae give rather low fat })ercentages, but otherwise 
an sufficiently elastic to suit all needs. As a matter of fact, 
comparatively few variations are recpiired except in different 
cases. 

:>. Top-milk Method. —The t<»p-milk metliod consists in 
using the mixture of cream and milk in the up])er one-third or 
upper one-half of a jar of milk that has been allowed to stand 
for some time, r^ater, the whole milk may be used. This 
method works satisfactorily only when the milk is bottled soon 
after milking, before the cream has sc])aratcd. For those who 
cannot obtain such milk the necessary mixture of cream and 
milk may be made as indicated by the table (p. 2(S0). The 
to}) layer of cream may be removed iVom the l)ottled milk with 
a spoon ; the remainder, by me:uis of a small dipper; f)r this 
purpose a f'hapin milk-di})pei-, which may be obtained at any 
drug-store, will be f )inHl very useful. Another method is to 
use a .-iphon. The plan of pouring oil* the upper one-third 
is not nearly so reliable. After it has been removed, and 
before the recpiired portion is taken out, the entire upjier one-

third or one-half, as the case may be, should be thoroughly 
mixed. 

The following tables require no explanation. When desired, 
the percentage of lime-water may be increased, or it may be 
replaced by sodium bicarbonate, 1 grain or more per ounce, if 
the milk is to be boiled. If the quantity required exceeds 20 
ounces, the smaller supplementary tables may be used, or the 
quantity may easily be calculated by adding an additional one- 
fourth to each item for 25 ounces, or one-half more for 30 
ounces, etc. 

The sugar may be measured by means of a pill-box holding 
exactly an ounce, or very conveniently by allowing two and one- 
half level tablespoonfuls of milk-sugar to the ounce. When cane- 
sugar is used, only one-half the quantity is required. Dry measure 
of sugar is just twice that of weighing. Thus, one ounce of sugar 
by weight would measure two ounces in a measuring-glass. 

The following formulas have been taken from Holt : ^

To obtain the exact fat-percentage take one-third the number of ounces of 
top-milk in a 20-ounce mixture and add 0.15 to the re.suh. In })rartice this 
slight error may be disregarded. 

Proteids: The percentage in eacli case will equal one-half of the fat. 

Sugar: 1 ounce in 20, or 1 even tablespoonful in 8 ounces, until the tbod 
becomes half milk; after that 1 ounce in 25, or 1 even tablespoonl'ul to ea.li 
10 ounces of the food, will give the proper amount. 

Lime-water: Usually in the proportion of 1 ])art to 20 of the total food 

Water or other diluent : Sufficient to be added to the fo]-cgoin>,^ ingredients 
to make the total number of ounces s})eciiied ; in i)art of this tiie sugar is dis-

the lower formulas (A, I), (', etc.) and 6 per cent, for tlie higher fornndas 
(G, II, T, etc.). 

Lime-water: 1 ounce to 20 ounces of the food will give 5 })er cent. 

4. Coitus Decimal Method.^ — This is based on decimal 
and volumetric methods. The inventor claims that it is easily 
memorized, and does not require any but very simple calculation 
to work out what is needed to \i\\<d the required formula. Three 
standard preparations are all that are required : (1) A decimal 
or 10 })er cent, cream. (2) A saccharated skim-milk for intro- 
(kicing proteins not carried by tlie cream, (o) A standard 
sugar solution for introducing kictose not carried by tlie cream 
or skim-milk. Only the decimal cream and the sugar solution 
are recjuired duriug the first few months. The 10 per cent, 
cream is best obtained by allowing a bottle of milk to stand for 
liitccu hours. The uj)per G ounces of each quart, when mixed 
with half its vc)lume of sterile water, give the required strength, 
'^riiere are diilerences in this gi'avity cream, top-milk, and cen- 
trifugal cream, as shown by the Ibllowing table, })repared by

The standard saccharated skini-nulk is made by a(hhnLi- ot^ 
grams of milk-sugar to 1 liter of skim-milk, which is e(|uivaleni 
to adding 1 ounce to 20. The skim-milk has a fornuila ot" 1 
per cent, protein and o per cent, sugar, or a ratio of o to 1. 
AVith the addition of the sugar the introduction of the jirotein 
is simple. A given amount of food nuiltiplied hy ().2o would 
indicate one-quarter of its bulk, which, if skim-milk, would add 
to the mixture 1 per cent, of })roteid. This ,<ame deeimal multi- 
plier would indicate the percentage of sugar thu> introduced by 
a 10 per cent, solution. The I'ollowing table will sli«»w the 
lactose carried by the saccharated skim-milk corre.^pondiiig in 
definite protein values :

The standard sugar solution is easily ])repai'ed by dis.-olvinL:: 
100 grams of lactose in sufficient water to make niea.>ure 1 liter 
(or in proportion of 2 ounces by weight to 20 oiuiee- of water). 
The only difficulty with the sugar is found in oc(,'asional impu- 
rities, such as free lactic acid, which should be gnarded again.-t 
because of its tendency to precipitate the ea.-^ein of the milk.

INFANT FEEDING. 



For the calculation of formulas three points only are to be 
borne in mind, namely : The percentage formula desired ; the 
quantity of food required, and that the standards, except for 
protein, represent percentage values in ratio of 1 to 10. Given 
these constant factors, the problem of adjusting percentage com- 
position becomes an easy one : The quantity of food required is 
reduced to cubic centimeters (ounces multiplied by 30), and this 
product is multiplied by the percentage tenth of the element to be 



introduced. The following

Having decided which formula is to be used, the ptmel con- 
taining that formula is the only one to be followed. 

The quantity desired for twenty-four hours is next t(^ be 
considered, and the apparatus filled — once, if 1(5 ounces or less 
are required for the twenty-four hours ; twice, if from IG to ^-Vl 
ounces are required for the twenty-four hours ; three times, it 
from 32 to 48 ounces are required for the twenty-four hours. 

DiRi':cTr()xs. 
(The lines beneath the words indicate the points to which the 
various ingredients are to be filled in.) 

1. Milk-sugar. — Introduce milk-sugar to the line so marked. 
Where good milk-sugar can not be obtained, granulateil sugar, 
in just half the quantity, should be used. A small cro.ss on tjie 
apparatus indicates this point. (See directions for Fornuda 7.) 

2. Water. — Add boiled water (hot) to the water-mark, and 



286 



INFANT FEEDING. 



stir uDtil the sugar is dissolved. If auy particles are seen 
floating in the solution, it should be filtered either through ab- 
sorbent cotton or through two thicknesses of clean muslin. 

3. IJme-u-ater. — Ordinary lime-water, such as is obtained at 
drug-stores, should then be filled to the L-water mark. 

4. Cream. — This sliould be the ordinary cream (16-20 per 
cent.) as obtained in bottled milk ; it should be poured in to 
the cream mark. If the cream is purchased separately, ordi- 
nary cream, and not centrifugal cream, should be used. 

o. 31ilk. — Ordinary good cows' milk should be used and 
the jar filled to the milk mark. 

6. The entire mixture should next be stirred. 

7. The whole should then be poured into separate bottles and 
sterilized if desired, or stoppered with cotton and immediately 
])laced upon ice. 

Directions for Foniiula 6. — 1. Sar/ar. — In this formula 
granulated sugar should be used in place of milk-sugar, and 
the sugar introduced into the vessel to the line thus marked. 

2. BarJeij-gmel. — In this formula barley-gruel should l)e used 
instead of water, and the glass filled to the line thus marked. 
Ixirley -gruel should be pre})ared as follows : To 1 tablespoonful 
of ])earl barley, after snaking for several hoiu's, a(kl 1 pint 

of water, a })inch of salt, and 
boil for five or six hours, add- 
ing water as necessary. Strain 
through muslin. Or the fol- 
lowing metliod may be used : 1 
rounded tablespoonful of Rol)- 
inson's barky flour; rub up 
witli cold water, and add to 1 
])int of boiling water ; cook for 
flfteen minutes, stir, and sti-ain

young infants he removes 9 ounces from the top of a quart of 
milk (fat to ])rotein, 3:1). For older infants he advises the 
removal of 16 ounces (fat to protein, 2:1). He dilutes this 
with wheat-, l)arley-, rice-, or oatmeal-water, using 1 or 2 
tablespoonfuls of flour and a quart of water, and boiling for 
fifteen minutes. This is dextrinized if desired, strained, and 
salted, and sugar is added.

Technic of Modifying Milk at Home. — In inHuv 
success in home modification a very careful technic niii-t he 
followed by the mother or the nurse. In the alt.-enee of a 
nurse specially trained for the purpose it becomes nece»ary lor 
the physician to give carefid written and verbal insi met ions, 
and then to see personally that these are carried ont. Knowl- 
edge on the part of the mother or nurse should not be a-sinned, 
for, as a rule, she does not possess it. There are many mir.-es, 
both graduate and otherwise, whose conceptions of infant feed- 
ing and milk preparation are practi(;ally useless. Like many 
medical students and recent graduates, they understand more 
about laparotomies tlian they do about milk. If this Is hoi-iie 
in mind, many unpleasant experiences may he avoided. 

The vessels and instruments used should be kept >enipiilou-ly 
clean, and be used solely for the j)urp()se intended. After u-e, 
or, what is decidedly better, just previous to being u>ed, they 
should be either boiled or scalded with l)()iling watei-, preferably 
the former. 

The nursing-bottles slioidd have rounded hottoms, >o that 
there are no corners for holding dirt, and also that they can m-t 
be stood about the room. If only one or two bottlo ai-e u<ed, 
they should be .^calded after each i'eeding and lille(l either 
with boric acid or sodium bicarbonate solution, made hy adding 
a teaspoonful of either drug to a ])int of ^^•ate^. \\ hen the 
bottle is to be used again, the solution should be ponrecj out 
and the bottle rinsed with })lain sterile water. 

The nipples should be of the ordinary short blaek-i-nhber 
variety. White nipples, which are said to contain lead, as 
well as all complicated nipples and tul)es, should be avoided. 
These latter can not be kept clean, and are a soinve of inlection 



292 INFANT FEEDING. 

in diarrhea. In some cities their sale is prohibited by law. 
After each feeding the nipple should be washed, turning it 
inside out to do this thoroughly, and then placed in a glass of 
boric acid solution (sj :Oj). It is a good plan to have several 
nipples on hand and to l)oil them before using tlicm for the 
first time, and then for five minutes every day. The hole or 
holes in the nipple should be just large enough to allow the 
milk to drop out somewhat rapidly. It should not flow out in 
a stream. If the holes are too small, they may be enlarged or 
new ones made by using a red hot darning-needle. Some 
nipples are made without holes, and these may be perforated in 
the same manner. When several holes are so made in a 
nipple, the milk may not drop very fast, but the food reaches 
the child rapidly enougli^ a fact that may easily be demon- 
strated if the nipple is grasped between the fingers and sucking 
movements imitated. 

Preparation. — It is best to prepare the entire quantity for 
twenty-finir hours at one time. If the weather is warm, the 
milk must be Pasteurized or sterilized immediately (see section 
on IMilk). If neither can be done, then, unless the weather is 
cold and a clean milk can be obtained, but one feeding should 
be prepared at a time. 

If the top-milk method is used, the milk should be received 
in bottles. In all cities there are reliable dairies that sup])ly 
milk in bottles. Where this is not the case, the bottles should 
be furnished the milkman, and arrangements can generally be 
made by Avhich the milk will be poured into them as soon as 
possible after milking. After the milk has stood for at least 
five hours, the first ounce of cream may l)e removed with a 
spoon and the remainder of the u])])er one-third or one-half, as 
the case may be, with a Cha})in milk-dipper. Another method 
is to use a bent glass tube and si|)hon ofi' the lower part of the 
milk from the bottom of the bottle, or the top-milk may be 
])oured off with reasonable accuracy. 

The physician should always wi-ite out the quantities to be 
used f )r ])repariug the milk. The milk- or caue-sugar is dis- 
solved iu hot water. Care should bo taken to use a sugar that 
giv(.'s a clear solution witliout filtering. If the solution is not 
clear, however, it should be filtered through a wad of cotton 
placed in the bottom of a funnel oi- through a ])iece of drug- 
gist\s filter-pajK'r. This solution, togetlier with the lime-water 
or sodium l)icarbonate, should be j)()iu-ed into a pitcher. Into 
this the milk, or milk and erenm, should b(^ ])oured, juid the re- 
mainder of the water added. T\\q water should alwavs be boiled. 



iMILK MODIFICATKjy. 293 

The mixture should theu be stirred and poured into the iHU>iiii:- 
bottles. Tlie bottles should then be >t()|)})ered ^vith ni(»deratel\- 
tight plugs of uon-absorbent cotton, to keep out bacteria. The 
bottles are theu Pasteurized or sterilized and phice<l in a reiVi<:- 
erator. 

At the feeding hour the bottle is taken out of the niVi^^ra- 
tor, placed in a pitcher or tall vessel df h(»t water to warm it, 
the cotton plug removed, and a nij)ple substituted, 'i'he milk 
should be heated until it is lukewarm — about US' -!)!»^ \\ 'l\n' 
nipple should never be placed in the month to t<'.-t the heat, 
but the milk may be allowed to drop on the wri.-t, when^ it 
should feel warm, but not hot. 

OTHER FOODS FOR INFANTS. 

The following foods may be of service in some conditions 
and may be briefly considered : 

Condensed Milk. — This is most useful in many cases a- a 
temporary expedient. It may be used to great advantaiie in 
certain difficult cases, especially those which have been im- 
properly fed on too high fat and protein mixtures. It is al-o 
useful at times in infants who are not gaining, and when the 
failure to gain is the only symptom. xVs a tem])orary feeding 
when pure milk cannot be obtained, as in traveling, it may be 
used to advantage. 

AVe g:enerallv use it in dilutions of 1 in K!, 1 in 1 2, or 1 in S — 
occasionally as high as 1 in (]. It should be mea-nred in a nieas- 
urinof class, otherwise too much will be used. It mav be diluted 
with plain boiled water or, if desired, with a thin cereal gruel. 

Cream may be added later or olive oil may be given in addi- 
tion. Orange-juice should always be given every other day or 
every day as an antiscorbutic. If condensed milk teediug i< 
continued too long, anemia, scurvy, or rickets is liable to de- 
velop, if not that, the child becomes large and flabby, but witli 
small bones and muscles and but little resistance to inleetiiai-. 

Condensed milk furnislies about 102 calories ])er ounce. In 
the dilutions as ordinarily used it contains the following })er- 
centages :

294 INFANT FEEDING. 

Buttermilk. — For many years buttermilk has been used in 
Holland for infant feeding, and of recent years it has been ex- 
tensively used in various countries. It has several advantages, 
chief of wliich are that it contains a low fat- and sugar-content 
and also lactic-acid bacilli in larger numbers. The curd of the 
milk is pre(;ipitated in small flakes. It is easily digested by 
most infants and may be diluted with water or cereal gruels as 
desired. Sugar may be added, if desired, as to any milk mix- 
tures. In cases where the digestive faculties have been im- 
paired by feeding mixtures containing too much fat it seems to 
be of especial value. It is also very useful in diarrheal affec- 
tions, especially those in ^vhich abnormal bacteria have found 
their way into the intestine. The lactic-acid bacilli drives out 
most of the other intestinal bacteria. In intestinal indigestion 
it is often of great value. 

The buttermilk is best kept and the mixtures made just be- 
fore they are used. 

Acid Milks. — These are extensively used, and are whole 
milk, to which various strains of lactic-acid bacilli have been 
added. These milks are sold under various names, and often 
other food substances are incorporated. Such acid milk con- 
tains fat in the proportion as ordinarily found in cows' milk, 
and in some cases may not be as desirable as buttermilk. In 
other cases where a very nutritious food is needed they are 
of great value. In intestinal indigestion acid milk is ])ar- 
ticularly useful, and it is also of service in the convales- 
cence from diarrheal diseases. It should be diluted to meet 
the individual case. It is a good plan to start with rather 
weak mixtures. 

Kumiss and other fermented milks are sometimes of use in 
very difficult cases. 

Albumin Milk. — This is a mixture suggested by Finkel- 
stein under the name of Eiweiss Milch, and has also been 
called protein milk. This food is prepared as follows : Heat 
one quart of whole milk to 100° F., add four teas])oonfuls of 
essence of pe})sin, and stir. Then let the mixture stand at 
100° F. until the curd has formed. Put the mass in a linen 
cloth and strain the whey from the curd. Remove the curd 
from the cloth and ])ress it through a fine sieve two or three 
times, using a wooden mallet or sjjoon. While doing this one 
])int of water should be added. The precipitate should be very 
finely divided and the mixture should look like milk. To this 
one pint of buttermilk is added. The buttermilk contains

little sugar and has tlie advantaiz:^ of coiitainin*^^ lactic acid. 
The composition of albumin milk is as ibllows :

One liter or quart furnishes ahout .'570 caloric-. To <»l>tain 
good residts from this milk it nuist he ii-ed in ;i eei-taiii 
wav. In the beginning it nuist not be mixed with anv othci- 
form of food, not even human milk. The inlani -liould be 
starved or given a ''tea diet.'' Small amoimts of albiuiiin 
milk are given, and if all goes well, larger and larger amonni-. 
The green, loose, bad stools should (julckly cliaMg<' t<i M»a]> 
stools, and then some form of carbohydrate shonld be added tn 
increase the caloric value of the food. Malt sugar i> u-iiall\- 
added, beginning with 1 per cent., which is sometimes addt d 
from the beginning. Some of the mixtures of malto.-e and 
dextrin may be used instead. 

There is an initial loss of weio-ht, owino^ to the low cal(»ric 
value of the food, then a stationary weight, and when the car- 
bohydrate is added there shoidd be a gain. Too long a period 
shoidd not elapse between beginning the milk and adding the 
carbohydrate. The dextrin maltose may be added up to o per 
cent., and if there is no gain, '1 per cent, of some cereal flour 
may be added. 

Albumin nnlk is a very valuable addition to the armamenta- 
rium of the pediatrician. It is dillicult to make, and for this 
reason cannot always be used in the cases where it would dn 
the most good. A full account by Hess will be found in the 
American Journal of the Diseases of Chiklren, r)ecend)er, 11*11, 
vol. ii., p. 422. 

It is indicated in diarrheal diseases and indigestion and 
various forms of nutritional disturbances, as marasmus, and 
where the tolerance for sugar, fat, or salts has been di-turbed. 

Gelatin. — In chronic intestinal infecti(uis, accompanied with 
food decomposition, gelatin is sometimes of great benefit. Some 
of the putrefactive organisms Avill not grow on gelatin. One 
ounce, which yields about 120 calories, may be gi\-en to a child 
in twenty-four hours. It may be mix(Hl with milk or giv^^i a< 
a jelly. Sugar-free milk will be found to be useful with this. 

Standardised Gruels. — Cha])in has suggested using 
gruels of definite strength, so that one may know the value 
of food given as gruel, and also the percentages of the various 



296 INFANT FEEDING. 

elements. He determined that the weight of the various meas- 
ures of different cereals were as follows : 

1 level tablespoonful of pearl barley weighs \ ounce avoirdupois. 

1 " " barley flour '• \ " " 

1 " " wheat flour " \ " " 

1 " " rolled oats " \ " " 

1 ounce di{){)er of pearl barley '' \ '' " 

1 '' '' barlev flour " 4- '• " 

1 " " wheat flour " \ " 

1 " " rolled oats '* \ '' " 

The percentage of various food components in gruels will be 
found to be approximately as follows : 

Pearl barlev. Barlev fiour. Wlieat. Rolled oats.

Plain gruels cannot be made much stronger than 2 ounces to 
the quart. 

Dextrinized gruels may be made up to as high as 8 ounces 
to the quart. 

Another method is to use cereal flours. Tlie percentages fur- 
nished by these flours will be found under the heading of 
Farinaceous Gruels in tlie first ])art of this volume. The cereal 
flours are, as a rule, very much better, as they make a smoother 
gruel and require nmch less cooking, fifteen to twenty minutes 
giving as snti.-factory a grnel as boiling rice or barley grains for 
three or four hours. The cereal gruels are very useful in 
modifying milk, and they may also ])e used alone in various 
diseases of the stomach and intestine. As they generally do 
not cause fermentation they are of great value in souk; forms 
of diarrhea. 

Oatmeal is of use in constipation, and the others are of value 
in diarrheas. Corn-meal gruels are vnlual)le in the underfed. 

The cereal flours contain nbout TOO calories to the ounce, 
and the underfeeding which occurs when a thin gruel is used is 
very apparent.

A quart of gruel is made by boiling from 1 level tablespoon- 
ful to 6 ounces of the soy gruel in 1 (piart of ^vater for tift<'en 
minutes, adding water to make up for loss by eva})oration. i^alt 
should be added to taste. 

These gruels do not thicken during cooking, as tlu'v contain 
no starch, and readily settle on stamling. This may he o\'er- 
come by adding 1 to 2 heaping teasp(»onfuls of barky, oat or 
wheat gruel flour before cooking, which will add (>.<» per c.-nt. 
to 1.2 per cent, starch to the gruels, and also slightly increa.~e 
the percentage of protein. 

A good standard gruel, which may be diluted as de>ired, m;.y 
be made by using 1 ounce of soy bean flour, 2 ounces of hark y 
flour, to a (piart of water. This will contain 2 per cent. pr. itein, 
0.60 per cent, fat, and 5.10 pc^r cent, carbohydrate, with a 
caloric value of 320 calories or 10 calories ])er ounce. This is 
just half the value of milk. It may be further increased by 
adding an ounce of sugar, which britigs it up to about -b")0, and 
the yolk of one Q^^g will add 55 calories tnore, (tr cream may he 
added, each ounce increasing the food value aboin 50 calurie-. 
About one ounce and a half of this to eat-h p(»inid of the babii-' 
w^eight will about cover the caloric needs o( the baby. With- 
out the cream or egg it will require about f )in' ounces per ])ound 
of body- weight. As this is more than can be given to advantage 
it should be remembered that the soy gruel should not be kept 
up unless the food-value is enhanced. This may often be done 
to advantage by adding condensed milk or cows' milk to the 



298 INFAyT FEEDING. 

gruel. This standard gruel, or a weaker one, may be used to 
dilute milk to advantage in cases of marasmus. The infants' 
stools should be somewhat brownish in color, like malted-milk 
stools. If the gruels are used too strong to begin with, the 
stools will be foul smelling and generally thin. The bean should 
be withdrawn and barley or other cereal gruels given, and when 
the bean is added again it sliould be done gradually. 

Vegetable Broths. — Edsall and Miller have experimented 
w^ith a bean flour, in which the starch is predigested by means 
of a diastasic ferment. They have found it useful in digestive 
disturbances and malnutrition. Mery recommends the use of the 
following vegetable broth as a substitute for milk after gastro- 
enteritis : 

Potatoes GO grams. 

Carrots 45 " 

Turnips 15 " 

Dried peas 6 " 

Dried beans 6 " 

Water 1000 " 

Boil in a covered earthen pot for four hours, strain and add 
water to make 1 liter, and 5 grams of salt. 

Olive Oil. — This is most useful where cream disagrees and 
where it is imperative to supply nourishment. It is sometimes 
of service in constipation in thin infants. From one to four 
teaspoonfuls may l)e given daily. AVe begin with one-quarter 
teaspoonful once or twice a day after feeding, and increase one 
dose a day until this amount is given after every feeding. It 
may then be increased to half a teaspoonful at a dose if thought 
advisable. One-quarter to one-half ounce a day is as much as 
it is advisable to nse in young infants. Older ones may take 
somewhat more. Olive oil furnishes "24o.5 calories per ounce 
by volume. 

Malted Milk. — This is valuable food in certain conditions. 
It may be used temporarily when pure milk cannot be obtained 
and in traveling. 

In some digestive disturbances it is also useful. It may also 
be added to milk mixtures. 

The composition of Ilorlick's malted milk is —

It is low in fats and \u<r\\ in suij^ars. INt ounce drv it lias a

water makes a mixture eonUiininji: approximately 1 per cent, iat,

of the infant are easily covered in the solutions ordinarilv used, 
but for continuous use has much the same objection- ;i- con-

or other fresh fruit-juice must be iriven, nnd i;it eilliei- a> cream 
or olive oil. When cream or olive oil is given n little le.-s milk 
may generally be used. 

Malt Soups. — The idea of using malted food, wns firM 
published by Liebig in ISO.'i. He (>ndeavoi-ed to pi-ep.ire :i food 
that should be chemically and ])hysiologlcall\ coi-icet. Kellai- 
in 1898 modified the I^iebig fornuda, and liis method \\a< a- 
f )llows : 50 grams (2 ounces) ol' wheat fl(»ur to ! lii<r, 11 
ounces of milk, with constant stirring. In a second ve--el 1<»() 
grams of malt-soup extract or malt (wtract, with tlu' a(Miti<>n 
of 100 c.c. {^2} drams) of a 10 ])er cent, solution of pnta>-iuni 
carbonate, are dissolved in | liter (20 ounces) watei- at 121 » l-\ 
The mixtures are then mixed an<l boiled for three or li\e 
minutes. This is said to contain — 

Protein - pcf (•••at. 

Fat l.-J •• 

Carbohydrate (maltose) iLl.l " 

The caloric value is 808 calories per liter, or somewhat moie 
than either mothers' or cows' milk. 

This may be diluted with water as desired, and approxi- 
mately the same dilutions as made with co\\>' milk may be 
used. Cream may be added if desired, but, as a matter of tact, 
the cases in which the food is indicated do not, a- a rule, bear 
the addition of much fat. 

A German preparation of maltose and potassium carbonate, 

Loefland's malt-soup e,vfracf, is nnich used, as it simplifies the 

measuring. Anv thick malt extract with the ])otas-ium car- 

• -I'll 

bonate (not bicarbonate) may be used. The bicarbonate i> liable 

to cause vomiting. Maltose often causes diarrhea, and the Hour 

added usually counteracts this. 

Malted Gruels. — Malted gruels are advocat(Hl by some, 

especially in preparing milk for infmts with N\'eak digestion. 

They are prepared in the following manner : A tables})<M)ntul 

of barley flour or of any other flour desir(>d is boiled in a little 

more than a pint of water for fifteen minutes. As soon as it has 

cooled a teaspoonful of a good malt extract or a teaspoonful of 



300 IXFANT FEEDING. 

diastase is added. This mixture is stirred thorontrhly, and may 
then be used in the pkice of ordinary barley-water. Diastase prep- 
arations are made by most of the leading manufacturing chemists. 
Diastoid, made by the firm of Horlock, maltine, and diazyme are 
preparations of this class. The thick malt extracts are some- 
times given to infants just before a feeding. Of these, several 
doses may be given daily for indigestion and constipation. 

Chapin suggests that a home-made decoction of malt be 
used in making malted gruel. His directions are as follows : 
'^ A tablespoonful of malted barley grains is put in a cup, and 
enough cold water added to cover it — usually two tablespoon- 
fuls — as the malt quickly absorbs some of the water. This is 
pre]iared in the evening and placed in a refrigerator over- 
night. In the morning the water, looking like thin tea, is 
removed with a spoon or skimmed off, and is ready for use. 
About a tablespoonful of this solution can be secured and is 
very active in diastase. It is sufficient to dextrinize a pint 
of gruel in ten to fifteen minutes. This should be prepared 
fresh every day.'' 

Ramogen. — This is a sterile, modified milk conserve, manu- 
factured accr»rdiug to the method and under the su})ervision of 
Professor Biedert. It has been highly reconnnended in Ger- 
many and has been introduced into the United States. It is sold 
in cans, and emulsions of it are made either with milk or 
water, according to the age and condition of tlie child. After 
summer diarrheas water emulsions are used as dilute, as 1 : 30. 
In premature or weakly infants dilutions of 1 :'20 are recom- 
mended to start with, using later stronger emulsions as a child's 
condition improves. Emulsions 1 : 13 and 1 :9 are frequently 
used. In constipation 1 : 9-8-7-") may be tried before adding 
milk to tlie mixture. Kamogen may also hv mixed witli barley 
gruel and with veal broth. In older childi'en enuilsions are 
made with Kamogen, milk and watei". The conqxt.-ition of 
some of these emulsions is said to be as follows :

Gartner^S Milk. — This is a proprietary niodiiicd milk first 
prepared by Gartner. It is made by centrifugalizini; a mixture 
of equal parts of cows' milk and of sterilized \vat<'r. The mixt- 
ure is put into a special machine and rotated -o raj)idl\ that 
it is separated mechanically into a cn.'amy milk and a >kini- 
milk. The cream thus drawn oif conUiins about the >ame 
amount of fat and protein as in [iveracie mother's milk, :ind 
sugar is added to it to bring the percentage u|) to abf.iii 7 j.'er 
cent. When fresh, it has been used with success in i'eedino- 
both sick and healthy infants. 

Backhaus' Milk. — This is a centrifugalized milk that ha> 
been subjected to the action of a mixture of rennet, tryp.-in, and

The first mixture contains 1 per cent, of lactalbmnin and 0.6 
per cent, of casein. The others consist chietly of casein with a 
small percentage of lactalbumin. 



FEEDING DURING THE SECOND YEAR. 

During the second year of life as much care is recjuired in 
feeding: as durinir the first. The fear of the second ,-iuniuer 
would laro-elv be overcome if the child were not tdlowed to eat 
food unsuited to its digestion. The fact that some children 
thrive on almost any kind of food is no excuse Ibr permitting 
a child to have the same food as its elders, as is so olien done. 
Most of the illness and many of the deaths of cliil(llio(Hl are 
traceable to improper diet. 

During the second year milk sh(»tdd iorm the basis of the 
diet. In cities or where the nnlk-snpply is not above suspi- 
cion, it is best to Pasteurize the milk until the second sinnmer 
has been passed, or even longer if circumstances warrant. As 
a rule, the milk requires but little modification, and after the 



302 INFANT FEEDING. 

eighteenth month, and often before, may generally be taken 
unmodified. As the child is now able to digest starchy food, 
milk-sugar may be omitted. In cases where the milk is not 
thoroughly digested, as is evidenced by curds in the stools, 
lime-water may be used, and may be added in quantities of from 
5 to 10 per cent., or even more if necessary. If the milk 
is very rich, it should be diluted either with lime-water or 
usually with plain sterile water — three parts of milk to one of 
water. If the milk is poor, or if milk that is not rich does 
not agree with the child, it may be prepared as follows : Fill a 
glass three-quarters full of milk, add one or two tablespoonfuls 
of cream, and fill to the top with plain water. If this does 
not answer, add a tables])oonful of lime-water. During ill- 
ness and often under other circumstances the alkaline carbo- 
nated waters will be found useful for diluting the milk. If 
the milk is poor, another plan is to use the upper two-thirds of 
the milk. 

Starchy food may be given in the form of gruel, either alone 
or, what is better, mixed with the milk. Barley-gruel or, if 
there is a tendency to constipation, oatmeal-gruel is added, one- 
fifth or one-fourth part of gruel being added to each feeding. 
The gruel should be freshly prepared and mixed immediately 
with the milk. A pinch of salt and a very small quantity of 
cane-sugar may be added to render it more palatable. It may 
then be Pasteurized like ordinary milk. 

During the second year five meals at about four-hour inter- 
vals should be given. The bottle should be dispensed with, 
and the food be taken from a cup or spoon. If the bottle is 
not t^iken from the child early, it may be difficult to break it 
of the bottle habit. The following diet-lists for different ages 
will be found useful : 

Twelfth to Fifteenth Month. — Milk ; barley, oatmeal, wheat- 
flour, farina, or arrow-root gruel ; barley or oatmeal jelly ; 
lightly boiled yolk of egg, given with stale bread-crumbs. 

Beef, mutton, and chicken broth, chicken jelly, beef-juice. 

Orange-juice or the juice of other ripe fruit, as of peaches. 

First meal : On waking, the child should receive a cup of 
warm milk, modified as previously suggested. If the child is 
accustomed to waking very early, more milk may be given at 
abcMit 7. A. M. ; otherwise this last may be regarded as the first 
meal. 

Second meal, 10.30 A. M. : Eight ounces of warm milk and 
barley -gruel. Third meal, 2 P. m. : One of following —

Orauge-juice, one or two tablespooui'uls at a time ma\- be 
given one hour before the 10.30 a. m. feeding;. II" tlicrc is a 
tendency to loose bowels, this sliould be omitteck 

If the chikFs appetite is very good, a small pie('(« of zwie- 
back may be given with either the second or the i'ouilh meal. 
This should not be soaked in the milk, but the child should be 
allowed to nibble at it dry. 

Fifteen to Eighteen 3fonths. — Same as above, togc^tiier with 
zwieback, stale bread (oven-dried), whole eggs very soft boiled ; 
strained oatmeal, barley, or wheat {)orridge; bread and milk, thin 
biscuit (crackers), junket, scmped raw beef or mutton in very 
small quantities. 

A Sample Diet for a Child of Fifteen to FAgJiteen }[onfhs. — 
BrectJfasty 7 A. m. — Either (a) two tablespoonfuls of a cereal 
jelly (oatmeal or other grain as desired), with >alt and two 
tablespoonfuls of cream, and eight ounces of milk to drink ; or 
(6) a bowl of bread and milk containing eight ounces of milk 
and a slice of stale bread. 

Second Mealj 10.30 A. m. — Milk, with a cracker or thin slice 
of stale bread or a piece of zwieback. 

Third Meed, 2 p. M. — One of the following: [<i) Very soft-

(beef, veal, mutton, or chicken) with stale bread-crumbs or a 
little barley added to it. (c) A tablespoonful of mashed baked

of zwdeback, a slice of stale bread, or a cracker or two. 

Fifth Meal, 10 p. m. (// needed).— Qu\^ of milk. 

Fruit-juice may be given, as previously directed. Eggs should 
not be given oftener than twice a Aveek, as children tire of them 
easilv. 



304 INFANT FEEDING. 

Eighteen Months to Two and One-half Years. — Milk is to be 
reo^arcled as the chief article of diet. Manv cliildren have no 
desire for other foods until after the second or third year. These 
children will generally be found to thrive on milk alone or with 
slight additions to the diet. As the child's digestive power in- 
creases, the following articles may, however, be added one at a 
time. 

Fruit : Juice of ripe fresh fruit, tliat of oranges and peaches 
being best. Ripe fresh grapes skinned and seeded. Baked 
apple — pulp only, the skin and seeds to be carefully removed. 
Stewed prunes, the skins to be removed by passing through a 
sieve. 

Meats : Scraped raw beef or mutton ; rare roast-beef or mut- 
ton pounded to a pulp. Chicken or turkey, the lean white meat 
minced to a pulp. 

Vegetables : Mashed baked potato with cream or covered 
with gravy from roast meats. If the latter is very fat, the fat 
should be removed by skimming or by means of a piece of blot- 
ting-paper. Very well-cooked spinach, celery, and cauliflower 
tops. 

Cereals : Well-boiled rice and other well-cooked cereals already 
mentioned. 

Desserts : Boiled custard, milk and rice puddings, junket. 

Four meals will generally suffice after the eighteenth month. 
The following dietary will serve as a suggestion : 

If the child wakes early, a cup of warm milk (six ounces). 

Breakfast, 7 A. M. — (a) Four tablespoonfuls of oatmeal por- 
ridge or other cereal with salt and two tablespoonfuls of cream ; 
milk to drink, (^b) Yolk of a lightly boiled egg with salt and 
bread broken into it ; milk to drink. 

Hecond Meal, 10.30 A. M. — Cup of milk with two soda bis- 
cuits (crackers), slice of bread, or a piece of zwieback. 

Dinner, 2 p. M. — One of the following : (a) A bowl (eight 
ounces) of meat broth with rice, barley, or bread-crumbs added 
to it. Slice of stale bread ; junket or rice and milk })udding. 
(/>) Tablespoonful of white meat of chicken or of rare beef or 
nuUton, either scraped or pounded to a pulp. Sbce of stale 
])read thinly buttered, junket, rice or miik pudding, or a boiled 
custard, (c) Perfectly I'resh boiled fish (the white meat) with 
a tablespoonful of mashed baked potato moistened with cream. 
Dessert as in preceding. 

Supper, O.30-6 P. M. — A bowl of bread an<l milk or a 



FEKDINC DUIliyc; THE SKCOSD YEAR. ".05 

cup of milk and a slice of bread or a piece ol' /\viel)ack. A 
cup of milk may be <i;iven at about 10 v. .m. if necessary. 

From two aud on(^-half yc^irs \\\^ (o the sixth Near the diet 
of the child may gradually be increased. Milk -hoiihl still, 
liowevcr, be taken in lar^e (Hiantities — about a (juart dailv — 
as well as some form of cereal for bi-eakfa.-t, with oi- without 
an egg, or fresh fruit if there is a tendcnev to cdn-tlpation. 
Meat ])reparcd as above should be gi\-en once a dav, and 
preferably at the midday meal, tog(>lher with j)oiato and some 
green vegetable, as s])inach, asparagus, or cauliflower lops, 'j'he 
evening meal should be light, and consist of bread and milk. 

It is well to prepare two lists, which may be given to tin* 
nurse or mother as a guide. One list should contain the I'ood 
allowed, and the other list those forbidden. It is not well to 
depend on verbal instructions, as they are easily ibrgotten or 
misconstrued. 

The Diet from Two and One-haJf to Six Ve(/rs. — ^[///: niav 
be allowed with every meal (may be omitted from dinner if" de- 
sired). The average child should take a (piart a dav, ])lain or, 
when plain milk is not thoroughly digested, modified a- Ibi- 
twelve to fifteen months. 

Cream. — Two to eight ounces a day mixed with the milk, 
taken as a beverage, with cereals, etc. 

Jyread and biscuit may be allowed with everv meal — -tale 
bread, dried bread. The so-called '' pulled bread," zw icback, 
and the various forms of biscuits or crackers. 

Cereals. — Almost any kind of cereal for breakf'a.-t ; oatmeal 
and wheaten grits are the best, ilice and hominy for dinner. 
Barley is useful in soups. 

Vegetal)leH maybe allowed for dinner — potatoes in some form 
or a cereal wdth one green vegetable; spinach, cauliflower top-, 
and the like are the best. 

Eggs are very good, but children are apt to tire of thein 
easily. They should be given f)r breakfast, as a I'ule, but 
never day after day. 

Meat. — Allowed once a day f )r dinner and in older children 
for breakfast occasionally. Boiled or broiled fish may bt- given 
for breakfast or dinner. 

Broths aud soups of simple composition may be eaten. AFeat 
broths with cream and cereals are especially nutritiou>. 

Desserts. — Once a day, with dinner. Plain cu-tard, milk 
and rice pudding, bread and custard pudding, and junket are 
the best; ice-cream once a week. Fruit should be given once

dally, and only ripe fresh fruit, in season, should be used. 
The best are oranires, baked apples, and stewed prunes. Ripe 
peaches, ]X'ars, a^i'apes without skins or seeds, may also be 
U'iven. Fresh juice of berries in small quantity, strawberries in 
perfect condition sjxirin^ily. Ripe cantaloupe and watermelon 
in moderate (piantities may also be allowed. Great care should 
be used in choosing and giving fruit to children. It is a very 
important article of diet, but if stale, spoiled or unripe, is capa- 
ble of doing much harm. Too nuich should not be given in 
hot weather. T^emonade is useful during very hot weather. 

AccoRDiXG TO Meals. — Breakfiid — Every day, milk to 
drink. A well-cooked cereal, with salt and cream, but little or 
no sugar. Bread and butter. 

In addition to the above, one of the f )llowing every day : 
Eggs lightly boiled, poached, and for older children scrambled 
or made into a plain omelette. Boiled or broiled fish. For 
older children a very little finely chopped beef, mutton chop, or 
beefsteak. For younger children meat at breakfast is not, as 
a rule, necessary. Fruit may be given l)efore or after break- 
fast, during the latter part of the morning, or at about noon. 
One variety daily, and if there is a s])ecial tendency to consti- 
pation, stewed prunes or baked apples may be allowed with the 
dimier, but not on the days on which they have been used 
earlier. Oranges, baked apples, stewed prunes, peaches, pears, 
grapes without seeds or skins ; ri])e a])ples (the softer varieties 
may be given; those known by dealers as 'Miard'' apples are 
not suitable used raw). 

Dinnci'. — Bread and butter as desired every day — not to be 
eaten to the exclusion of other foods, however. 

One soup each day. Bouillon, beef, veal, mutton, chicken, 
or oyster broth, which may be thickened with barley or other 
cereals (either grain or fiourj. Milk and cream may be added 
where desirable. 

One 'nic(d (faiii/ — roasted or broiled. Ik^efsteak, beef, lamb 
oi- mutton cho]), rare roast beet' or mutton, chicken, white meat 
of roast turkey. 

Tiro ve(j€tabl('i^ ddily — one green vegetable and one other 
dish, usuallv ])otato in some form, should be given. Potatoes, 
l)aked or nia.-hed, cauliflower tops, asparagus-tips, stewed celery, 
s|)inach, hominy, ])lain macaroni, mashed peas, young string- 
beans, and almost any green vegetable in seas<^n. 

iJcxsrrf. — Junket is the Ix-st, and may be given most fre- 
(juently, but v'wo and milk ])udding, ])laiu custard, and plain

tapiocii puddiiijr may also he used in small (jiiaiitities. Ice- 
cream once a week. Fruit in some cases mav he used. 

Siij)jH'r. — Voiy light simph' supjuTs should he gixcn everv 
day. Milk, milk-toast, hread and l)utter, and, for older children, 
a little stewed fruit or haked apple, without loo much >u<jar. 

Articles Fokp.iddf.n (alt<'r Holt). — The ihllowinn- articles 
should not he allowed childi-en under tour vears of at^', and 
with few excei)ti()ns tluy may he withheld with advantage up 
to the seventh year. 

Mads. — Ham, sausage, pork in all forin<, -alted iish, corned 
beef, dried beef, goose, game, kidiuy, li\-ci-, haeon, meat-^tew-, 
and dressing from roasted meats. 

Ve(jet(ihlex. — Fried vegetables of all wii-ieties, cahhatre. p<.ta- 
toes (except when boiled or roasted), i-aw (»i- iVifd onion-, raw 
celery, radishes, lettuce, cneumbei's, tomatoes (raw or cooked), 
beets, egg-plant, and green corn. 

Bread and Cake. — All hot l)read and rolls ; buckwheat and 
all other griddle-cakes; all sweet cakes, particularly those con- 
taining dried fruits and those heavily frosted. 

Desserts. — All nuts, candies, pies, tarts, and pastry of every 
description ; also salads, jellies, syrups, and preserves. 

Drinks. — Tea, coifee, wine, beer, and cider. 

Fruits. — All dried, canned, and preserved i'rnits : banana- ; 
all fruits out of season and stale fruits, particularly in sum- 
mer. 

The meals should be given at fixed hours, which j)ractice should 
be strictly adhered to. Feeding between meals, t^en when con- 
sisting of the most trilling things, should be avoidt'd. It' the 
child can not go from one meal to another without discomtort, 
the intervals should be shortened. In certain cases it may he 
advisable to give a small cup of milk or broth and a cracker 
between the meals, at stated intervals, as in leeding younger 
children. 

Candies, cake, and the like should l)e ke])t iVom young chil- 
dren. In well-regulated homes, if he once learns that he can 
not have them, the child will soon cease to demand >weeL<. 
Tlie frequent indulgence in sweets of variou- kin<l> creates a 
desire for them to the exclusion of other food. This craving is 
analoo^ous to that ibr alcohol in adult-. ()\ crindiilo-ence in 
sweets causes indigestion, headache, and the like, ailments that 
may easily be ])revented. 

The child should be taught to eat slowly and to chew the 
food well. To this end, some older individual >hould alwavs 



308 



INFANT FEEDING 



be present at meal-times to see that sufficient time be taken for 
the meal, and that the food be finely divided, as young children 
do not, as a rule, chew very well. The quantity given to a 
healthy child should depend on his appetite. In sick children 
this is not a reliable guide, and, where possible, fixed amounts 
may be given (see Feeding of Sick Children). The child should 
not 1)6 forced to eat, nor should he be given special articles 
to tempt the appetite. If the food offered is not taken, it is 
well to wait until the next meal, when it will generally })e 
found that the appetite has returned. Loss of appetite is often 
merely an indication that the digestive organs require a slight 
rest. 

During the heated portions of the year the child will require 
less solid and more liquid food. The same is true during sick- 
ness. Many of the gastro-intestinal disturlxuices attributed to 
teething are the result of improper feeding.

DIET OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. 

Tito period usually s])()k('n of as'^scluH)! days'' Is an cx- 
tremclv active one ])hysic'ally. The vast iniinhei- of metal >< •lie 
cluini>:es goiuij: on and the growth of tlio hody ilcniand :i plctiti- 
ful and a suittible diet. B(jth in and out of school and in 
seminaries careful attention should be given to ibod, iVesh air, 
and exercise. In other words, the physical development 
shotild receive as nnich attention as the mental gi-owth. in 
boarding-schools especially the diet shonld be the sul»jc<-t of 
careful studv, the aim being to avoid monotony and to pro\ide 
a sufticient and satisfying diet. In many schools the dietary 
is left to the discretion of the cook. In considering school 
dietaries several points are worthy of consideration. 

Milk, being easily digested in most cases, is of great \alne, 
especially for children whose ntitrition is below normal. It 
shonld be furnished as a beverage daily ibr break fa-t and 
sup])er, and is advisable even with dinner. It may al-o be 
used in the preparation of })U(ldings and sonps. ( 'rcmn is very 
valnable, and whenever ])ossible shoidd be supplied in .■^utli- 
cient quantities. A cu]) of warm milk with bread or ci'iiekers 
is helpful during the middle of the morning and as a siih.-titnte 
for tea in the afternoon. Delicate children and others may with 
advanta<re take a Mass of warm milk a short time Ixdbrc ^oin^- 
to bed. If the rising hour is some time beloi'c thai set lor 
brciikfast, a cup of milk or of bread and milk should b(^ given 
on rising. 

Eggs may !)e used alone or in the ])reparation (d various 
dishes. They may be used in almost any v.ay except fried. 
Fried eggs are apt to be very indige-tible. They ai'c often 
prepared in this way in order to di.-^guise the stale taste ot an 
egg that has been in storage for some time. 

Meat is a very important ]xirt of the diet, as it c(nitains a 
larger quantity of protein, from which the tissues are built up, 



310 INFANT FEEDING. 

and in a more available form, than in any other form of food. 
Milk and eggs are also valuable sources of ])r(^tein. Meat 
should be provided, therefore, in sufficient quantities, half 
pound a day being, perhaps, a good average allowance for a 
growing boy, the larger and more rol)ust taking that quantity 
or more, the smaller and more delicate children taking some- 
what less. Steak, chops, and roasts of beef, mutton, lamb, 
fowl, and bacon are the most suitable meats, althougli pork, 
together with meat stews, meat ])uddings, sausage, and liashes, 
may be allowed in smaller quantities. These last, wliile gen- 
erally relished, are not so digestible nor such good sources of 
nutriment as those first named. AVith care and pro])er prepara- 
tion many of their ill effects can be obviated. More meat is 
required in winter than in summer, and more in cold climates 
than in warm. Yeo states that too much meat may give rise 
to eczema. 

Meat may be given twice a day, and eggs or fresh fish may 
be substituted for it about three times a week. When these do 
not satisfy the appetite, meat may be added. For this purpose 
cold sliced meat is useful. 

Bread and butter should be given with each meal. Bread 
made from the whole-wheat flour may be used in the largest 
quantity, but it is well to supply various kinds of bread, to avoid 
monotony. '^ Brown bread '^ given continuously becomes very 
tiresome. Bye bread may be given occasionally, and bread 
made from mixtures of wheat and rye is very palatable. Busk, 
l)iscuit, and crackers may also be supplied. Corn-bread, when 
properly made, may be given once a week or oftener, and 
griddle cakes of buckwheat, corn, or wheat flour two or three 
times a week. These last may be served with syrup or fruit- 
juices. 

Cereal porridges of all kinds maybe given for breakfast, oat- 
meal being probably the most desirable. 

Vegetables of almost all varieties may ])e used. For dinner 
two varieties should be given, one green vegetable and j)ota- 
toes. Salads made of the green vegetables, with the very sim- 
])lest dressings, are useful additions to the diet. 

Fruit should invariably be given once a day. 

Sugar should })e ])rovided ibr in the dietary. Candies and 
manv of the sweets given to chihlren are harmful and cause 
indigestion and dvs])epsia. It ])ro])er sweets were {provided, 
there would be slighter tendency to indulge in the less desir- 
able forms whenever opportunity aiforded. A\'ith the meals, 



DIET OF SdlOOL CIIILDIIKX. :>1 1 

and when the appetite demands satislyiiig hetween meals, they 
may be given with or witliout a uinss of milk. l\eoiilai-ily 
should, liowever, be observed, and tiiey should not l)e gi\en 
immediat(>ly before or after a meal. I"'i'iiit-syriips, suL'"ar 
syru])s, honey, preserved fruits, nnd jam may be eaten with 
bread. Caramels, ehoeolat(>, maple-suo-ar, and plain sutiar 
taflies are tlie best of the other forms of sweets. 

Simple desserts, sueh as custards, milk j)U(l(liiiL''s \\ ith rice, 
tapioca, and the like, bread pudding, ])lain cakes, and j)ropcil\' 
pre])ared pastry may be used. 

The beverages should be water and milk. \\'<ak c()c(.:i or 
chocolate may be given after the seventh year. Tea and colfec 
should not be given before the thirteenth ycai', and may be 
withheld advantageously still longer. Alcohol is not to be 
used exce})t by a physician's direction. 

Especial care should be taken to avoid a monotonous diet, 
for there are many instances where the constant repetition of a 
certain form of food has created a dislike for it that has j)er- 
sisted throuo^hout life or been overcome only with ditlicultv. 

A second })oint to be remembered is that the ibod should be 
well prepared and attractively served. This luis more to do 
with influencing the appetite of delicate, nervous children than 
is generally supposed, and can not be insisted u})on too 
strongly. 

Overeating should be avoided, and to this end an older 
person should always be present when practicable ; in school, 
this should be insisted upon. On the other hand, a child 
should not, through caprice or habit, be allowed to eat too little. 
Bv exercisino- a little tact, most of the dislikes which arc not 
deeply rooted, but which may become so if persisted in, may 
generally be overcome. These dislikes are often the result of 
imitation. 

Sufficient time shoidd be allowed not only lor the meal, but 
for the performance of w^hatever small duties may be re(juired 
of the child. A time should be set for one or two regular 
daily visits to the water-closet. Hurrying to sclio(/l should be 
avoided. Heading: and studvino; immediately befoi'c and after 
meals should be prohibited, as should bathing or any very 
active exercise. Some light form of recreation may, however, 
be indidged in. The hours for meals should be so arranged 
that the child may have freshly prepared meals, and not cold 
luncheons or warmed-over dinners. Lastly, nibbling and eat- 
ing between meals, except under the conditions previously 



312 INFANT FEEDING. 

described, should be strictly prohibited. In spite of stringent 
rules, however, many infringements will occur. 

It is by neglect of the diet, fresh air, and exercise that many 
cases of tuberculosis gain headway ; anemia may result from 
such neglect, and a delicate, nervous cliild be the outcome of 
one that should, by right, be healthy. 

Diet I/ist for a Boys' School.— Breahfast, 7.30 a. m.— 
Half-hour allowed. Fruit. A cereal with cream. Bread and 
butter, eggs, boiled, poached, or as omelet. Fish occasionally. 
Corn bread once a week ; griddle cakes once a week, ^lilk to 
drink. 

Dinner, 1 P. M. — Three-quarters hour allowed. Soup ; 
meat — roast-beef or mutton,- steak, or chicken; fish once a 
week ; potatoes and a green vegetable. Hominy or rice once a 
week. A simple dessert ; fruit. 

Sapper, 7 v. M. — Half-hour allowed. Hash, cold meat, fish, 
or omelet in small quantities. Bread and butter with syrup or 
preserved fruit or fruit-juice. Plain cake. ^lilk to drink. 

Beginning Cases that Have Been Previously Im- 
properly Ped. — This requires judgment and experience. If 
the baby has been very much upset, it is a good plan to with- 
hold all food a day or a part of a day. This gives the digestive 
organs a rest, aud often means success where failure w^ould have 
resulted from feeding almost any food. During the starvation 
period plain water may be given, or sometimes a little w^eak 
barley-water or albumin-Avater. These latter are useful when 
anxious parents cannot be persuaded the child will not starve. 
They mav also be used where there is evident hunger. In any 
case the quantity should be small. We often give an initial 
purge of castor oil in these cases to insure getting all the food 
out of the intestine. 

A careful study of the stools, of the history of previous feed- 
ing, and the svmptoms which may be attributed to the feeding 
or to the disturbances of metabolism. J>y so doing the diagno- 
sis of the trouble may be made and much valuable time saved 
i)v correct tlierapv. A study of the following facts will be 
found useful in this connection : 

The Infant's Stools. — A very fair conception of the 
infuit's digestion can be obtained from an examination of the 
stools. This should be doiu^ in all cases, and is as important 
a part of the routine as the examination of the heart or 
lungs. 

The size of the stool should be noted first, althougli this is 



DIET OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. 313 

not of very o;i-cat iinjKM'tancc, as it varies witli llic miinbci' of 
stools and the size and peculiarities of the eliild itself. 

The number of stools is always to he eonsidei-ed, hut is not 
nearly so important as the eharaet(M' of the stool. An infant 
may have one or two stools a day, oi- as many as foui-, ii\'e, or 
six, but so lono- as the character of the stool remains ^'ood, it 
may be regarded as perfectly normal. In diai'rhea the course 
of the disease is better told by the (juality oi" the stools than 
by the number^ and this may to a certain extent be said lo \nt 
true of constipation. 

The consistence of the stool of nursinu: infnnts should noi-- 
mally be about that of butter, althouuh sliu'ht variation- either 
way are not to be regarded as distinctly abnormal. The .-tool 
should be smooth, and contain no curds or solid masses. Jri 
constipation the stools are hard and dry, while in diarrhea they 
are soft or liquid. 

JiUmps are frequently seen in tlie stool. TIicm' ai'c usually 
curds or masses of undigested fat. They may, however, be 
clumps of mucus. 

Mucus is present normally in the stool, and its presence i> 
easily demonstrated; it should, however, l)e so intimately 
mixed \w\t\\ the stool that it can not be seen with the naked 
eye. Any irritation of the intestinal wall causes a great 
increase in the amount of mucus in the stool. Jn diarrhea and 
in intestinal indigestion there may be large amounts, and in 
constipation considerable mucus may cover the hard ma.-ses of 
feces. 

The reaction of infants' stools is nsually acid or neutral, 
although sometimes it is alkaline. Kither acid or :ilkaline 
stools may be altered in color. A retui-n to a normal col<»r is 
usually brought about in tliese cases by th(> adniini.-tration of 
an alkali when the stools are acid, and rU-c nrs<i. Alkaline 
stools, green in color, may be ])roduced by giving alkalis in 
large doses for several days. The color of the stool olten 
furnishes considerable information as to the condition of the 
infant. Normally the color is a light butter yellow, but the 
stools may vary somewhat in this res])ect, and be lighter or 
darker. In young breast-fed infants the >tools may be a dark 
yellow, like the yolk of an VQ:i^. In artilicially \V(\ babies the 
stools are apt to be very light in color or even decidedly whiti>h. 
Rhubarb imparts a yellow color to the stool. 

White stools are seen sometimes in artificially led children 
that seem to be otherwise in normal condition. As a rule, 



314 INFANT FEEDING. 

however, white stools are either the result of the ingestion of 
excessive quantities of fat or indicate an al)sence of bile. In 
the former cases tlie stools are large, whitish, and have the 
characteristic odor of fatty acids, which resembles that of 
rancid ])utter. The stool may be dried and burnt with the 
same odor and tlie fat may be dissolved by ether. When bile 
is absent, the stools are wliite and have a very foul, almost cadav- 
eric, odor. 

liccl dooiH may owe their color to the ])resence of fresh blood 
from the rectum or the lower part of the intestinal tract. When 
it comes from the upper ])arts, the blood is always black. The 
streaks of fresh blood frequently seen where hard stools are 
passed come from slight excoriations of the anus. 

Black stook are caused by the presence of blood. In this 
case the stools are black and tarr}'. The blood may come from 
the intestines or stomach, or from blood swallowed, especially 
that from hemorrhage from the posterior nares. 

Bldch or hlachkli-hro^ni ."^fools may also be caused by the 
administration of bismuth, iron, or tamiic acid. Broion stools 
are frefjuently seen as the result of bacterial and chemic changes 
ill the intestine in the course of intestinal indigestion and intes- 
tinal infection. Raw beef-juice may give rise to foul-smelling 
brownish- or fjravish-colored stools. 

(yrcoi doolH are due to a large number of causes. This may 
result from intestinal indigestion and infection due to improper 
food, usually either an excess of sugar or of fat, or to the pres- 
ence of })acteria. Calomel causes green stools, and alkalis, if 
continued and not neutralized in the intestine, may produce the 
same effect. 

Symptoms of Dietetic Brrors. — Too much stress can 
not be laid upon the importan(;e of investigating the source of 
disturbances due to dietetic errors. There is ample rooju for 
lui'ther clinical study of this subject. 

Too Low Protein. — The stools are small and constipated, if 
the other food elements are low, as they are apt to be. The 
child does not gain weight so i-apidly as a normal child, or it 
may remain stationary or even lose weight. It is an(!mi(', and 
if the low protein is continufMl, the child becomes marantic. 

Too High Protein. — The child is a})t to have c(tlic, vomiting 
any time, but usually half an hour oj- more after I'ccding. The 
stools contain undigested (;urds, and mucus, and may i)e yel- 
lowish <:;reen or oth"rwise discohjred. 



OTHER FACTORS IX IXFAXT FEKDIXt;. 31 



low, aiKi 



Too Low Sugar. — The gain in wciglit is apt to be sh 
the child may be consti])ated. These infants are usually thin. 

Too High Sujcar. — Voniitiuir an houi- oi- two after meals, the 
vomited matter usually being sour. A(;id eructation- are 
common. Colic is fi'equent. The stools are generally grass 
green and very irritating, the buttocks oftcMi being (wcoi-iatcd. 

Too Low Fat. — The child gains weight slowlv, and is a])t to 
be constipated unless an excess of sugar is given, •a< in con- 
densed-milk feeding. 

Too High Fat. — The child vomits an houi- or two after feed- 
ing. Colic is common. The stools may be thin and green oi" 
greenish yellow, and contain small masses of undigested fat and 
considerable mucus. These small lumps are often mi-laken ini- 
curds. They are more or less translucent, and when burnt give 
oif the odor of fatty acids ; they may be dissolved in ether. 
Curds are not, however, dissolved in ether. iVnother type more 
common is the large, white, rather dry stools having the oi'T 
of rancid butter. 

It must be remembered that the condition of the stools may 
be due to one or more of the food elements, and expcM-ience in 
these cases, as in most others, is the best teacher. It is only by 
practice and careful observation that the feeding of infants may 
be conducted properly. Another fact to l)e remembered is that 
the food need not be changed to meet every trlHing alteration in 
the temper of the child or in the character of its stools. 

OTHER FACTORS IN INFANT FEEDING. 

Feeding in Infant Asylums. — Tlie feeding of infants 
in overcrowded infant asylnms, with their lack of iVe.-li air and 
paucity of attendants, is a matter of great diiliculty. .Vny 
attempt at scientific feeding under such circumstances will ulti- 
mately lead to failure, the method in these cases being held to 
blame. The primary cause of malnutrition and marasmus in 
institutions is the lack of fresh air and individual care, and 
until these are obtainable it is useless to attem])t to accomplish 
anything by special feeding methods. In smalkn- institutions 
the use of the Materna graduate will be found satisfactory. 

In the larger asylums it is well to have two or three general 
working formulas, such as fat 3 per cent., sugar (> ])er cent., 
protein 1 per cent.; and fat 4 per cent., sugar 7 per cent., 
protein 2 per cent. These may be varied by adding more or 
less water to them to adapt them more closely to s])ecial needs. 
The younger infants may, when possil)le, receive special mix- 



316 INFANT FEEDING. 

tares. For substitute feeding, condensed milk, barley- and egg- 
^vater will be found most useful. 

The allowance of a few cents a day generally made for an 
infant's entire care is quite inadequate to accomplish any good. 

Acute Sugar Poisoning. — In cases in which there is 
nutritional disturbance sugar may at times cause a symptom- 
complex, which when recognized should be followed by discontin- 
uing all sugar, and, indeed, all food for a day or two. And 
when feeding is begun sugar should be withheld. Human milk 
is the l)est food in these cases. Albumin milk or buttermilk is 
the best substitute. There is a history of a loss of weight and 
diarrhea, with thin, green stools. There is great prostration, 
with drowsiness and short periods of coma. There is irregular, 
usually high fever, shallow, irregular respiration, weak, irregular 
})ulse, albumin and sugar in the urine, but no acidosis. The 
character of sugar in the urine is that which has been given. 
Lactose may not be noted if Fehling^s test is used, as it requires 
prolonged boiling. The phenyl-hydrazin test is better. 

Finkelstein's Classification. — An outline of this is in- 
cluded, as it is much talked about at present. The chief value 
of his work seems to us to be the use of albumin milk, the rec- 
ognition of food intolerance, and that some of the conditions 
which have been regarded as merely gastric or intestinal are 
more deep seated. 

He separates four classes : 

1. Disturbed metabolic balance (Bilanz Storung). 

2. Dyspepsia. 

3. Intoxication. 

4. Decomposition (acute atrophy). 

1. In the case of disturbed metabolic balance the condition 
is what we describe as a mild case of marasmus. There may 
be a congenital idiosyncrasy in regard to milk, or there may 
have been improper feeding, especially too high fat. The symp- 
toms are either no gain in weight or an irregular increase below 
normal, in spite of tlie fact that the infant is getting what should 
be sufficient or even more than sufficient food. There is a wider 
range of temperature than normal, es])ecially marked in infants 
under six months, and also where the tolerance for carbohydrate 
is disturbed. The stools are gray or white, dry and frial)le if 
too much milk has been given, and they are green and thin if 
excessive carbr)hydrate has l)een given. Vomiting is frequent 
and there is tympanites. The mux-les are soft and flabby and 
the skin pale. The child is restless and irritable and sleeps 
poorly, and irritation and infection of the skin common. 



OTHER FACTORS LV IXFANT FFFDISC. ?M 

In these cases tlie ])r()teiii (li<j^estioii and retention are normal. 
The disturbance is due to tat, carbohydrate, or >aUs cau-ini; an 
abnormal reaction. 

The treatment of these cases is best accornpli.-licd bv liiunan 
milk. Where this is not possibk', skimmed milk ic'cdinir or 
buttermilk is often useful. If ordinary milk mixtures are used, 
the fats may be decreased and an increase made in the carljohv- 
drates. Sometimes chantrintr tlie form of suj^ar that is used is 
of value. Malted foods or malted milk added to the milk mav 
be of value. 

2. Dyspepsia. — This represents the second dejxree of severity, 
and there are acute gastric intestinal symptoms. These cases are 
due to a congenital lowered tolerance to cows' milk, to errors in 
diet, either too much food or too much of some one e-lement. 
Feeding with infected milk and infectious diseases, either gen- 
eral or local, may be the primary cause. 

Finkelstein believes that sugar, salts, and fat are the excltintr 
causes, and advises giving human milk when possible. It' this 
is not available, in the mild cases reduce the milk and suixar, 
and in the severe cases reduce sugar, whey, and fits. First, 
starve a day and then give buttermilk or one-third boiled milk 
and two-thirds thin oatmeal gruel. It is in these cases that 
albumin milk is especially indicated. (See al)ove.) 

3. Intoxication. — These cases are what we call gastro-enter- 
itis, sunnner diarrhea, or cholera infantum. They are due to 
food intolerance, to infected food, or to heat. Finkelstein be- 
lieves that infants in which the diet has been rich in sugar and 
whey will have an intoxication, while those fed on a diet rich in 
fat and low in sugar will have decomposition or atrophy ; tliat 
is, his fourth class of cases. 

The symptoms of this intoxication class are what we call 
summer diarrhea. The treatment of these cases, ae(M)r(,lIng to 
Finkelstein, is to starve a day or t^v^o, but give suiliei(Mit water. 
Subcutaneous salt solution infusions in tlie more severe cases 
are of value, or salines per rectum by the dro]) method may be 
used. Stimulants and sedatives are used as indicated. Human 
milk should be given if possible, and if it is not, a diet low in 
fat and sugar. Albumin milk, beginning with very small (pian- 
tities, may be used. After the starvation day give ten feedings 
a day of 5 c.c. of albumin milk, and then increase 50 c.c. a day 
until the stools are improved, and then 100 c.c. a day until 180 
to 200 c.c. are given daily for each kilo of weiii:ht. After the 
stools are solid, add 1 per cent, sugar and increase gradually to 



318 jyFANT FEEDING. 

\ per cent. The total feeding should not exceed 1000 c.c. of 
all'Uiniii milk daily. 

}. ihe decomposition of atrophy cases are characterized by 
a lu-k of al)iliiy to assimilate food. There is a subnormal, irreg- 
iiliir temperature, weak pulse, irregular respiration, and rapid 
1m~- ot" wciirht. There is usually great hunger, often vomiting, 
and th(} stools are usually abnormal. Feeding with human 
milk i- almost an essential to sueeessfid treatment. If it is not 
availa!)l<", buttermilk or albumin milk, with the addition of 
mallo-c, mav be u>ed. 

The Feeding of Difficult Cases. — The feeding of cer- 
tain iiitanls ol'teii becomes a dilHeult matter, not so much on 
accoiiiit of actual conditions of disease, as owing to personal 
i(lio^\n(Ta-y. Others again are difficult to feed because of 
actual di-cax- of the digestive organs or on account of the 
lov..iiiig of nutrition due to the existence of other disciises. 
TIh-c ca-es will be considered in ])roper order. 

At the outset it nuist be remembered that the fault may not 
be due to the food it-elf, but to its j^iTparatiou or the mode or 
time of administration, and to improper surroundings and care. 
1'o -iicceed in the^e ditficidt cases it is necessary to look dili- 
c« iiilv into th<' minutest details of the infant's life. 

Loss of Weight. — l^oss of weight in an infant should 
alwav- ])e coii-ideied a very serious symptom. During an acute 
ill lie--, -iich as j>neumonia or diarrhea, this is to be expected. 
In chronic conditions the weight may fluctuate, going up and 
down, or remaining moi-e or less stationary. If, however, in a 
peri"(l iA' a month or two there i< no general tendency to gain, 
in -pile of the ihictuation, this indication is a serious matter. 
W'Ikiv an infant i- losing \veiL[;ht without any special cause, 
tlii- may be attribut'-d to insuilicient food. If the infant is 
mir--iii'j. the brea-t milk' may be ])oor or insufficient, or both. 
1 1 i!i<' bake i- bottle-fed, the milk mav not have been increased 
'•' -treii-jtli in proportion to the child's growth.

in-j" ;i food -nited to an infant's digestion. This end, however, 
on<<' attained, the |)hy-ician may increase the quantity, but not 
the i|naliiy, of the food, and the infant finally ceases to incrciise 
in \sei_dii, remain- -tationary, and then loses. Tvoss of weight 
tjiay al-o be due to a food t<»o rich in })roteins or to one unsuited 
i" 'iM infant's digestion. This hitter cause usually, but not 
al\s:.; -. '_ri\c- ri.-e to oilier svmptom.-. 



OTHER FACTORS IN INFANT FEEDING. 319 

In ail cases a careful study of the food is essential. Accu- 
rate' charts of the quantity ol' food taken, tlie time, whether tlie 
child vomits and at what time, and the number and ciiai-aeter 
of the stools, etc., are of great helj). If the food is increased 
or decreased, as the case may be, to an avei-a<^e strcn<i:th for a 
child of the size and weight of the one under consideration, 
and there is then no change in the child's condition, the foo(i 
should be peptonized, either partially or completely, or mi.\(!d 
with an albuminized or malted food or with barky-water. The 
addition to the dietury of albumin-water or of small (juantities 
of one of the predigested beef ])reparations (Pan()p(^pton, 
gtt. v-xxx ; Liquid Beef Peptonoids, gtt. v-o) ; or one ol' the 
other beef preparations in similar doses mixed with water) is 
indicated. Minute doses of nux vomica or strychnin, with or 
without an alkali as bicarbonate of soda, or of creasote (Liquid 
Beef Peptonoids with creasote, gtt. v-xx, of the Arlington 
Chemical Company, is an excellent form in which to give crea- 
sote) are often of value, es})ecially where tuberculosis is sus- 
pected. Loss of w^eight may be caused by persistent vomiting 
(see Vomiting). 

The physiologic loss that occurs during the first fort}'-eight 
hours of life should not be forgotten. 

Stationary Weight. — This frequently follows when an 
infant is weaned or when one is fed artificially from the outset. 
Even if the child is receiving correct percentage^ of food it may 
not gain for several weeks. So long as the infant is well and 
the percentage and quantity given correspond to those directed 
for an infant of the same age and weight, no alarm need be felt, 
even if a month should elapse without showing increase in 
weight. How^ever, once the regular gain in weight is estab- 
lished, it should not remain stationary, but should increase 
gradually from week to wx^ek. The average weekly gain dur- 
ing the first year of life is between four and eight ounces. The 
weight may occasionally, without any ap})arent assignable cause, 
be the same at one weekly weighing as it was at the preceding 
one. If this persists, a careful search for the cause must be 
made, and will often be found to be insufficient food. 

Colic. — This is more apt to occur in breast-fed than in bottle- 
fed babies on the percentages usually recommended. It is espe- 
cially likely to come on during the first three months. In 
breast-fed infants it is often a difficult matter to overcome. If

aAVA(;E 321 



GAVAGE, 



Gavnge, or feeding by nutans of a stoiiia('li-tii])e, is a inetluHl 
used in various diseases and conditions of inlanev and child- 
hood. In cases wliere the child is not able to take nourishment, 
or only in insufficient amount, and in cases of uncontrollable 
vomiting, this method may be resorted to. Jt is us(hI in the 
feeding of premature infants, whether in an incubator or not, 
and in cases of small, weak, marantic infants who, owing to 
weakness or lack of appetite, do not take suilicient nourishment. 
It is also employed after surgical operations about the head or 
neck where swallowing is interfered with, and in acnite diseases, 
such as pneumonia, in fevers, and in delirium or coma. 

The results that follow this method of feeding are surprising, 
especially in cases where there is constant vomiting or where 
the stomach has a very small capacity. In the former case the 
vomitino^ mav cease and the food be retained ; in the latter, the 
capacity of a stomach that ])reviously held only an ounce or 
two may rapidly be increased until an average-sized feeding is 
retained with ease. 

The technic of the method is simple, and the procedure con- 
ducted without difficulty in children under two years of age ; 
above that age it may be difficult, and a mouth-gag may be re- 
quired ; in some cases nasal feeding must be substituted. The 
apparatus employed is the same that is used for washing out 
the stomach, and since it is frequently desirable to wash out 
the stomach before introducing the meal, the same tubing may 
serve for both purposes. It consists of a soft-rubber catheter 
connected, by means of a piece of glass tubing, to a ])iece of 
rubber tubing to the other end of which a funnel is attached. 
The nurse holds the child on her lap, \vith the head held straight 
and not inclined in either direction. The catheter is moistened 
with warm water and held several inches from the end, so as 
to allow enough of it to pass into the esophagus with the first 
attempt at introduction. The mouth is opened, if necessary, 
and the catheter passed ra])idly into the pharynx ; there is usu- 
ally a swallowing movement, and the tube is readily passed into 
the stomach. If the procedure is carried on too slowly, the 
tongue may interfere, or if the catheter is held too near the end, 
it may cause gagging. Before introducing the food it is well to 
wash out the stomach with normal salt solution. As soon as 
all the food has entered the stomach, the catheter is ])inched and 
rapidly withdrawn. If it is withdrawn slowly, the food may 
"^21

coinv up with tlic tul)e. If the catheter is left open as it is 
w ithdrawn, the dri])})!!!^- into the pharynx may cause vomiting. 
II" the child is youni;-, it is a good plan to keep the finger be- 
tween tlic jaws for a few moments to prevent gagging. If the 
f(.(id ('(lines 11]), the feeding must be repeated. 

Nasal Feeding". — For this ])nrpose a catlieter in propor- 
ti'iii \n the A/A' of the child sliould ])e use(L The procedure is 
the same a< that for adults. (See Forced F\'eding.) 

DIET IN DISEASES OF CHILDREN. 

Cyclic Vomiting". — This is a curious derangement of 
rnctaholisiu, in which there is an acidosis that may have been 
started in one or several ways. In addition to the acid poison- 
in--, there is said to he a disturbance in the ratio of the excre- 
ti(.!i ot' uric acid to urea. Durinii^ the attack it is well to give 
the .-t(iniacli absolute rest, as food and drink tend to aggravate 
the condition. Sodium bicarbonate solutions should be adminis- 
tereil by rectum by the Murphy drop method, and they may be 
ahernated with 2'luco.-e solutions, o per cent, being a desirable 
strene-th. Hie soda is useful in combating the acidosis, and 
the Ldueose furni.-hes a carbohydrate which is extremely useful 
in e-iabli^hing a normal metabolism in the acid conditions. If 
tlie ;i:i;iek is prolonged, additional rectal feeding may be given. 
Sill ill do^e- of atropin administered by stomach is sometimes

di' t. As a rub.', when the attack is over, convalescence is

the cause. In the cases due to siiirar fermentino;" in the bowel, 
sui^ar sliould be eliminated from the diet, and buttermilk mav 
be added to the diet from time to time. In the cases caustnl 
by fits, the fats should be lowered and sufHcient foods con- 
taining alkalis should be used — that is, sufHcient vegetables. 

In the majority of cases the best results will be obtained 
from the use of meat, eggs, milk, green vegetables, and stale 
bread and similar carbohydrates. The sweets should be en- 
tirely or almost entirely eliminated from the dietary. In addi- 
tion, the child should have an occasional saline purge if there 
is any tendency to constipation, and, if the attacks are recur- 
ring frequently, administration of bicarbonate of soda for two 
or three days of each week seems to give satisfactory results. 
Most of these cases are improperly dieted and treated, bcnug 
mistaken for attacks of gastritis. There are few conditions in 
which proper treatment yields such satisiactorv results. 

Stomatitis. — In stomatitis the feeding often becomes a 
matter of great importance. In the milder forms there is not 
much difficulty in getting the child to take li(|uid nourishment, 
especially if it is given cold. In the severer forms, such as 
ulcerative stomatitis, the child may refuse all food, Jn these 
cases it should be offered food in the form of ice-cold milk, 
albumin-water, and the like. If all food is refused, or if in- 
sufficient quantities are taken, rectal feeding must be instituted. 
In some cases nasal feeding may be resorted to, but in many 
patients where this is indicated it can not be em])loyed because 
of the inflammation extending into the nares. In all cases the 
diet should be similar to that used in scurvy. Fresh fruit- 
juices and vegetables are to be given. In the ulc;erative cases 
chlorate of potassium or mineral acids are useful. 

Acute Gastric Indigestion — Acute Gastritis. — As 
these diseases can not, as a ride, be distinguished from each 
other at the outset, and since the dietetic indications are along 
similar lines, they may, for convenience, be considered together. 

The main indications are to empty the stomach and to give 
it rest. If possible, it should be cleansed by washing with a 
tube and an abundance of warm water ; where this is not pos- 
sible, warm water may be given to drink, and, if necessary, 
vomiting induded. 

Food should be discontinued entirely f »r six hours, and 
during this interval small quantities of hot water may be given. 
At the end of this time, if the vomiting has ceased, small 
amounts — 1 to 3 ounces — of albumin-water or of barley-water 
may be administered. Milk in any form should be withheld 



324 INFANT FEEDING. 

for twenty-four hours, when, if the baby is breast-fed, it may 
be nursed for a few minutes at three-hour intervals. If this is 
found to agree with the child, the time of nursing may be 
lengthened and tlie intervals between feedings shortened. If 
the baby is bottle-fed, it is well to withhold cows' milk, and to 
give album in- water or rice-water in its stead ; when the stomach 
has become tolerant, other articles may be added. At first 
broths, free from fat, and meat-juice may be tried, followed bv 
malted milk. Only small quantities should be given at first, 
and at intervals of three or four hours. As improvement 
occurs the food may be given oftener and in increasing quan- 
tities. In the severe cases, where vomiting persists, prepared 
foods, such as Panopepton or Liquid Beef Peptonoids, diluted 
with water, may be retaine<l. For the younger infants and for 
older infants if the stomach is at all irritable, it is well to pep- 
tonize the cows' milk when it is first given. For older infants 
a small amount of milk may be added to a large quantity of a 
cereal water, such as barley-water. It may be well to boil the 
two together for a few minutes. The amount of milk may 
gradually be increased, an equal volume of lime-water being 
added to it at first. If the stomach is very irritable, small 
doses of hot water frequently repeated may be tried, or, what is 
usually of greater service, teaspoonful doses of ecpial parts of 
lime-water and cinnamon-watei*. 

Chronic Gastric Indigestion — Chronic Gastritis. 
— While different pathologic conditions are present in these 
diseases, tlie treatment is practically the same, and for this 
reason they may be considered together. In both diseases the 
food is apt to be retained in the stomach for a long time; it 
is also likely to be imperfectly digested, the large amount of 
nuicus whi(;h is usually })resent in itself interfering with diges- 
tion. The stomach should be washed out once or several times 
a dav witli warm water or with a weak solution of sodium 
bicarbonate (1 dram to the pint). The food should be given at 
intervals of three, four, or even iive hours, according to the 
age of the child. It should be suited to the infant's digestion, 
and what has been said about infant feeding in general and the 
feeding of ditlicult cases apj)lies here. Patience and judgment 
are necessary to determine what is the best food for the infant 
and just how long it should be continued without a chanire. 
In this, as in so many other conditions, experi(Mice is the safest 
guide. Th(! milk may i)e partially peptonized or a milk low in 
proteins may ])e given. A milk low in fats is often attended 
1)V good results. Occasionally the sugar may be reduced with 
advantiiLTc;^ or condensed milk or one of the propri(»tarv foods 



DIET IN DISEASES OF i'lIILDllEN. 325 

may be tried. Barley-water and milk in varyin<^^ proportions, 
but usually with a laru^e amount oi' l)arl<'y-watcr, may be 
digested. I>arley-water and a weak, I'at-ircc \-cal l)rotli may be 
mixed toij^ether in e(jual (juantiti<'s and used to advant;ii:e. In 
soTue eases whey mixed with barley- oi* rice-water mav be liied, 
and if it is ])()ssible to ti:ive i'at without eausin<j^ vomit iIlL^ ei-eam 
in small amounts may be adde<l to the mixture. 

(xeneral hyo:ienic measures should eareCullv be observed. 

Dilatation of the Stomach. — 'Hie method- of (bairnosis 
and tre:itment of this eondition are similar to those when the 
disease (xxnirs in adults. The essentials of the treattnent ar<! 
stomach-washino', small meals at suilieiently lon*^^ intervals, and 
tonies, sueh as stryehnin and nux vomica. The ehai-aeter of 
the food should be about the same as that advised for c'hroni(.' 
gastritis. 

Pylorospasm and Hypertrophy of the Pylorus. — 
These conditions are usually associated. Snnetimes one meets 
with eases in which there is hypertrophy only. Many of the 
cases are a combination. The ])rognosis dejxnds largely on 
the amount of actual hypertrophy ])resent. In very young 
infants the trouble is usually of a functioned nature. In voung 
infants the stomach should be washed out juhI all food gi\en 
by means of a stomach-tube until tlie vomiting cea>es to recur. 
If the vomiting is very persistent, rectal leeding may be tried. 
Glucose solution is, perhaps, the best remedy to be used, and the 
dro}) method should always be tried by preference. Small 
doses of atro})in sulphate {-ttj}j^y> gi'dn for young infant<) may 
be administered from four to six hours, often with very 
marked effects. Mothers' milk (which at first has the cream 
removed) is the best food, but mixtures of skinuned milk and 
water to which 3 grains of sodium nitrate has been added to 
each ounce may be used. PeptonizcHl milk is al>o u-eful. 
^leat juices have been su.gixested, but milk feeding is probably 
better! 

Diarrhea in Infants. — It should l-o remembered that 
diarrhea may be present in a great varietv of diirerent eondi- 
ditlons, and there are many complicating theories c(»neerning it, 
and also concerning the dietetic treatment. 

Some cases are sim})le, and are due to dmigs, to laxative 
fruits, or to gross errors in diet. Other cases seem to l)e 
caused by thermic influences, heat or cold, but usually extreme 
heat. Some cases are reflex, or are due to general or local dis- 
eases not directly connected \\\i\\ the digestive tract. Some are 
due to impure milk, and are either caused by bacteria or toxins 



326 INFANT FEEDING. 

(ptoiiKiins) which have been formed in the milk. In some the 
dysentery bacilhis is the cause, the disease beini; simply a 
dysentery in an infant. At other times streptococcus infec- 
tions of the intestine or other definitely pathogenic bacteria mav 
be the cause. Sometimes protozoa or other forms of animal 
parasites may cause the trouble. There is local disease and 
coustitutioiral disturbance, wliich varies greatly both in its 
extent, manifestations, and dangers. Some cases are due to food 
intolerance. These are usually due to feeding too much fat or 
too much sugar, or to the child's having a lowered resist:uice for 
one or the other. Sometimes the metabolism of the salts may 
be at fuilt. (See Finkelstein's classification.) 

We try to classify the cases cliuically as regards feeding into 
(1) simple diarrheas where there are no serious local or general 
disturbances, although some of these cases may ])resent alarm- 
ing symptoms ; (2) intestinal intoxications and infections in 
which there is the added element of either a toxin or of patho- 
logic bacteria; and (3) cases in which there is more or less 
disturbance due to food intolerance and where there may be 
a marked derangement in metabolism. 

It is well to remember that the diagnosis of these present 
unusual difficulties at times. One cannot, as a rule, tell 
whether the diarrhea is sim])le, infectious, or a food intolerance, 
although with experience one may at times make the diagnosis 
at the start. A diarrhea in a child fed on the breast alone is 
ffcnerallv simi^le. A diarrhea in a bottle-fed child when the 
mean temperature is around 80° F. and tlie humidity high is 
usuallv an intoxication or an infection. The cases due to f )od 
intolerance have the history of stationary weight with or with- 
out some digestive disturbance, or there have been symptoms 
referable to overfeeding of fat or sugar or of an intolerance for 
one or the other. Feeding with too high fat and too high sugar 
at the same time is more liable to cause the trouble than when one 
element alone is too high. 'J'luu'e is usually no especial intolcTance 
to ])rotein unless the normal limit has been considerably exceeded. 

The Diet in Simple Acute Diarrheas. — In the breast- 
fed babv an initial j)urg(', ])referably of castor oil and plain 
water, until the l)owel has been emptied, is usually all that is 
r('(|uir('d. If there is vomiting, tlu; breast may be withheld 
until the stomach is (piiet. Washing out the stomach in these 
cases usually stops the vomiting. A little water before feedings, 
to dilute the milk in the stomach and to somewhat lessen the 
amount tid<en, is usually all that is rcnpiired. 



DIET IN DISEASES OF CHILDREN. 327 

In the bottle fed and the partly bottle fed one cannot tell at 
the onset what the nature of the disease is going to be. It is, 
therefore, ini})ortant to have the diet meet any emergency. 
Stop all food of whatever kind and give a dose of castor oil or, 
if that is vomited, of calomel. A tenth of a grain every twenty 
minutes for ten doses is usually effective. Smaller doses may 
be used in young infants. Salines may be used if preferred. 
We greatly prefer castor oil if it can be retained. For twenty- 
four hours nothing except plain water should be given or, at 
most, a little thin barley-water or a little weak albumin-w^ater. 
In the j^artly breast-fed bal)ies who are manifestly not ill, a little 
breast milk may be allowed if there is no vomiting. If there 
is any doubt, starve the child for the first twenty-four hours. 
At this point we wish to remind our readers that we refer to 
acute diarrheas in children w^hose stools have been normal. We 
have seen babies suffering from mild, chronic, intestinal indi- 
gestion given the most heroic treatment, which they did not 
need. After twenty-four hours, if the vomiting continues, the 
stomach should be washed out, either with plain water or, better, 
a weak (1 dram to the pint) sodium bicarbonate solution. If 
there are toxic symptoms from the outset, it is well to wash out 
the bowel as well. 

After twenty-four hours the diet will have to be decided 
upon according to the condition of the child. There are no 
fixed rules, and, unless care is taken to consider each case on 
its own inerits, there will be more failures than successes. If 
the child is free from fever, and is looking and feeling well, it 
does not always mean tliat tlie child is out of danger, although 
they are very favorable signs. In these cases ^ve allow a tliin 
barley-grncl, rice-gruel, or albumin-water. These may be given 
in from half to the full size of the customary feeding, according 
to circumstances. In strong children the full amounts may 
generally be allowed. In this class of cases, at the end of 
another twenty-four hours, the feeding may be increased and 
the gruels may be made thicker. In some cases we add a tea- 
spoonful of condensed milk to one of the feedings, and, if well 
borne, this may be increased to something under what might be 
given a normal child of the same age and weight. Sometimes 
we use malted milk in the same way. At other times a soy 
bean gruel will be found satisfactory. In this class of cases we 
generally give bismuth subcarbonate or subuitrate in 10-grain 
doses in a dram of chalk mixture. This may be administered 
every two hours. If the stools are not normal, but show evi- 
dence of fermentation, buttermilk diluted to about the usual 



328 jyFAST FEEDISG. 

dilution of cows' milk may be given. Plain water or barley- 
gruel may be used as a diluent. If buttermilk cannot be ob- 
tained, a skimmed milk soured by the lactic acid bacillus tablets 
(of which then' arc a number of different brands on the market) 
mav be u>ed. The sourinir should be complete before the milk 
is r<'adv f )r use. There is usually no objection to adding a 
little >uirar. Sometime^ it is an advantaire. In the severer 
cl:t.-< of cases the suirar is best omitted. Most infants do not 
like buttermilk the first time they taste it, but it is the excep- 
tional infant who will not eventually take it readily. Under 
it- u-e th(.' stool- often become smooth and yellow, and the child 
makes a rapid return to normal. The buttermilk feeding is 
continued {\^v a short time il' desired, and even f»ra long period 
it" th*' child continue- to gain. Lactic acid bacillus tablets, 
e-pcciallv the l>idg;ira tablets, iiav(; l)een f )imd of value in the 
inteetiou^ ibrni.-> of diarrhea, (xenerally, after a week or ten 
(lavs ol" normal -tools tiie diet may be changed to the customary 
f xxl. It is -ometime- an advantage in making the change to 
starve the child for a short period of from twelve to twenty-four 
hour-, and then begin very graduallv, as in begiiniing bottle 
fecdiii'_r. In the severer class of cases albimiin-milk may 
be u-ed, beginning immediately after the period of starva- 
tion, and fdlowing the directions ibr its tise. Albumin-milk 
i- a valuable addition, but it must be properly used to obtain 
L'"''od re-ult-. Directions ari; given under the heading of 
Ali)uniin-niilk. 

In the -evere cl:i->es of ca-es, with a great deal of vomiting, 
l:ir<jf and t"rc(|ncnt stools, and great prostration, the feeding is 
olten a gra\e jiroblem. It fre(piently hap{)ens that nothing is 
retained by the stomach, and it i.- not possible to use the Murphy

several days to increase the food value. Cereal gruels and 
weak broths, to which cereal gruels liave been added, may i)e 
of use. Where the sugar metabolism is not too much dis- 
turbed, condensed milk or malted milk may be added to the 
cereal gruels after several days. To begin with, one teaspoonful 
of eitlier 2 ounces or even less sliould be given, and if there 
are no untoward effects the amount may be cautiously increased 
to the normal strength or slightly below it. The soy bean flour- 
gruel may be used to great advantage in these cases, beginning 
with small r^uantities and increasing, as suggested in the direc- 
tions for using the bean. Womens' milk is of great service in 
these cases after the acute stage is over, and there is a period of 
undernutrition which is difficult to overcome. A wet nurse 
may be used, or the milk may be obtained by using a breast- 
pump. Milk may usually be procured in this manner when a 
wet-nurse cannot be secured. Partial feeding with womens^ milk 
may be used, as it is often not possible to obtain the full amount. 

Beef-juice and the proprietary solutions containing beef and 
alcohol are sometimes useful, but in the amounts in Avhich they 
are usually administered really add but little to the needed 
amount of food, and one is apt to be misled as to their food 
value. Beef-juice is liable to cause loose foul-smelling stools. 

Tlie severe cases of diarrhea dependent on or associated 
with food intolerance are usually difficult to deal with from the 
dietetic standpoint. The mild forms, in which the general health 
of the child is not much affected, generally yield promptly on 
reducing the excessive fat or sugar, as the case may be. The 
cases which present severe symptoms of intoxicatian may prove 
rapidly fatal, and these patients may reject food of any kind. 
In the sugar cases, the symptoms of which are noted below, a 
day of starvation, with plenty of water by mouth or rectum, 
or salt solution subcutaneously, if needed, is indicated. This 
may be followed by a diet of albumin-milk or of diluted butter- 
milk, and the results are often quite satisfactory. As soon as 
the stools become yellow, boiled cereal gruels may be added to 
the food, and low percentages of sugar may be used with 
caution. Later, the sugar percentage in the food may be kept 
rather low. The tolerance for sugar often returns if the child 
is properly dieted. The cases due to fat intolerance, also noted 
below, generally yield to a diet low in fat, albumin-milk, or 
buttermilk. The subject of food intolerance in infants needs 
further study and clinical observation.

tlic child. It is generally best to give small doses, sufiieiently 
diluted with water, every two or three hours ; but if fluid eau 
be given only in teas])Oonful doses, it may be necessary to 
give a teaspoonful of the diluted beef every iifteen minutes or 
half-hour. Completely peptonized skim-milk may be tried, 
and albumin-water and Stokes' brandy-and-egg mixture are 
often given with good effect. In other eases barley- or rice- 
water is retained. Malted milk is often of great service, and 
the malted foods, which are ordinarily mixed with milk, may 
be given mixed with water instead. Kumiss may sometimes 
be retained when other foods are rejected. Animal broths free 
from flit are also useful. If vomiting is persistent, gavage 
should be resorted to. If any one of the foods mentioned 
seems to augment the number of stools, another should be 
substituted. 

As the child improves, malted milk, (me of the malted 
foods, or equal parts of millc and barley- or rice-gruel boiled 
together, may be given. Eskay's food is valuable in the con- 
valescence from diarrheal diseases. Raw or very rare scraped 
meat may be given, but this is a})t to cause very offensive 
stools. Eggs cooked in various ways and later plain boiled 
milk may be given. Zwieback, crackers, and toast may be 
added cautiously to the dietary, juid the return to the normal 
allowance be made gradually. Great care should always be 
exercised during and ai'ter convalescence, as dietary errors are 
apt to be followed by speedy and severe relapses. Fresh fruit, 
coarse vegetables, and all irritating and indigestible articles 
should be prohibited. 

Chronic Ileocolitis. — The dietary of a child with this disease 
is not easily constructed. The foods directed for acute cases 
are all useful, and a dietary can be formulated from them. 
The effect of any food on the stools should be watched, but 
observations should not be made in the presence of the patient, 
as children of four years or more may become very morbid 
from watching frequent examinations of their stools. 

The predigested foods, such as the beef preparations, pepton- 
ized milk, and the like, are among the most valuable articles 
of diet in these cases, but barley- or rice-gruel, with or without 
milk, and eggs may also be used. Malted milk and the malted 
foods are of service at times. Alcohol, in the form of whisky, 
brandy, port or sherry, and in whatever shape it is most palat- 
able, may be given. 

Inunctions with cocoanut oil or cocoa-butter are useful in

viduals, may usually be relieved by reducing the carboliydrates 
to a minimum. These attacks are occasionally so severe and 
misleading as to give rise to the diagnosis of malaria^ tubercu- 
losis^ typhoid fever, and many other diseases, even by compe- 
tent physicians. In almost every instance a complete cure can 
be quickly brought about by dietetic means alone. 

Between one year and eighteen months it is common for 
mothers to desire to increase the diet of their children. jNIilk 
should always form the basis of the diet, and if other articles 
disagree, a diet of milk and broths exclusively may bring about 
a state of perfect comfort. 

In Older Children. — The management of these cases is, as a 
rule, quite satisfactory. They require individual study, how- 
ever, for in one case the fat may be the cause of the trouble, in 
another it may be the curd in the milk, and in still another the 
carbohydrates may be the disturbing element. The diet should 
aim to give the intestine as little work to do as possible. To 
this end, the carbohydrates should be discontinued altogether at 
first ; and when they are begun again, it should be cautiously, 
and the effect should be carefully watched. The fats should be 
greatly reduced or even omitted altogether. Protein should be 
given in as digestible a form as possible, and })eptonized if it 
cause indigestion. 

In severe cases the child may be fed u])on peptonized skim- 
milk. This may be completely or ])artially peptonized, as cir- 
cumstances demand. It should be given in moderate quantities 
every two hours. Kumiss may be used to vary the diet, and 
buttermilk, if the child w^ill take it, forms an agreeable change. 
Albumin-water and liquid predigestcd beef preparations may 
also be used. Chicken or veal broth from which the fat has 
been removed may likewise be given. 

Rare or raw meat is usually w^ll borne. It should be 
scraped fine and given immediately after preparing it. If 
desired, it may be rolled into small balls. Of this, two or 
three tablespoonfuls are an average daily allowance. Beef is 
to be preferred, but mutton may be })ermitt(d. Dish gravy 
from which the fat has been skimmed may be given, and may 
be served in a green glass if the color of the fluid excites 
disgust. 

After a week or two, if improvement has begun, a malted 
food may be added to the milk. Eskay's Food is of particular 
value in these intestinal cases, and is occasionally well borne 
when even peptonized milk is not. The food should be given

quently easy to detect idiosyncrasies, and to learn what agrees 
and what disagrees with the particular ])atient in charge. 

A point of no small importance is tlie avoidance of starva- 
tion. Unless a jihysician thoroughly understands the feeding 
of infants he may starve a child and render it weak, anemic, 
and unable to wdtlistand the eifects of the disease. Cases that 
have been set down as intractable catarrh of the intestine are 
often merely the results of starvation or due to an unsuitable 
milk mixture. In such cases, -svith return to a rational diet 
recovery promptly follows. 

Intolerance to Fat. — This is frequently noted in infants 
and also in older individuals. In infants it may })roduce 
vomiting one or two hours after feeding, or the symptoms may 
be lari2relv referable to the intestines. In this case there are 
colic and large white stools, or sometimes thin greenish stools, 
which are very irritating to the skin. Sooner or later tliere is 
a marked disturbance of general health, and the children are 
usually, though not always, pale and thin. In older children 
an interesting and often wrongly interpreted symptom complex 
may be noted when too much fat has been added to the diet. 
This may be done on the advice of the physician, wdio orders a 
thin child to have an abundance of cream, butter, and oil, with 
the idea of building it \\\). Older children showing fat intoler- 
ance are generally, though not always, pale, thin, and in general 
bad health. They are irritable, and often have marked circles 
under the eyes, and the breath has a very foul odor. Often this 
symptom is the one for which relief is sought. In other chil- 
dren there may be marked gastric and intestinal disturbance, and 
attacks of colicky diarrhea. Excessive qtiantities of fit may 
be found in the stools. Another interesting class of cases are 
those in which there is recurrent vomiting due to excessive fat. 
The diagnosis can usually be made by a careful study of the 
diet and stools, and confirmed by the effect of treatment, which 
consists in cutting down the amount of fat in the diet. As in 
older individuals, there is a lack of absorption of fats when 
there is icterus. 

Constipation. — Chronic constipation is the cause of more 
w^orrv and distress than almost any other con.ditlon. In order 
to relieve it, the diet nuist be regulated carefully and correct 
habits be formed. The formation of correct habits is of as

of this condition. Infants as young as three months of age 
may be taught to have a stool regularly by placing them upon

a small chamber at a stated hour. In older ehildren a fixed 
time should be set for the daily visit to the closet. The best 
time for this is just after a meal, preferably breakfast, as at 
this time there is a wave of ]K'ristalsis of which advantage may 
be taken. 

Constipation is quite connnon in breast-fed infants, and is 
usually due to the child's oettina; a miuinium amount of food 
or a milk that is low in iat and (xcnerally high in })rotein. The 
quality of the mother's milk should l)e improved if })()ssiljle, 
following the directions ])i-cviously laid down. Between the 
nursings the infant sliould hv given water. If this is not suffi- 
cient and the mother's milk is found deficient in fit, 1 or 2 
teaspoonfuls of cream may be added to each nursing, or cod-liver 
or olive oil may be given in half to teaspoonful doses. An 
efficient change in the diet consists in giving 1 or 2 tea- 
sp(jonfuls of thoroughly cooked oatmeal. This should be of 
about the c()nsistence of cream, well sweetened with sugar, and 
strained if neces.-ary. This may be given once, twice, or 
oftener a day, as tlie case re([uires, and is best given with a 
nursing. Orange-juice well swe(>tened may be prescribed in 
doses of a teas])oonful to a tables])oonfui, given an hour or so 
before a nursing. Stewed ])rune-juice may be used in the same 
manner, and in season any fruit-juice from perfectly fresh ripe 
ii'uit may b(3 utilized. The very acid fruits should not be 
allowed. A teaspoonful of ;i malted i'ood ])re|)ared with barlev 
may l)e given, and small amounts of the thick sweet malt 
extracts may be used with a<l vantage. Mellin's Food may be 
used to sweeten the ibful in place of sugar. Care should be taken 
not to disturl) tlie infant's digestion by the too irequent use of 
any of the articles just mentioned, or by the use of too large 
quantities ; only one article should be tried at a time. Tf these 
means fail, drugs or sup])ositories must tenqiorarily be resorted 
to. Ft should be l)orne in mind that the constant use of drugs 
inav defeat anv eiforts along dietetic lines. 

In l)ottle-fed babies, if" the milk is modified ])roperly, con- 
stipation will usually be overc(»me. li' relief is not obtained 
by this means, measures similai- to those directed for breast-fed 
babes must be taken. A small (|iiantity of barley- or oatmeal- 
water may be mixed with the milk or a malted food added to 
it. Louis Starr gives the tbllowing diel-li-t for con.-tipation 
in a ehild from eighteen months to two and one-half vears 
of age : 

Fir!<i Mfiil. 7 A. M. — A break fistcnpful (f.sviij) of new

milk, with an additional tablespoonfiil (f.sss) of cream ; 2 to 4 
tablospoonfuls of thoroughly cooked oatMieal or cracked-wheat 
porridge, with cream and salt ; 2 slices of whole-wheat or 
bran bread, buttered ; the juice of a ripe orange, or half of a 
moderate-sized ripe apple scraped with a spoon, or a small ripe 
pear, scraped, or a peach. 

Second MeaJ, 11 A. 31. — A teacupful (fovj) of milk, with

or chicken broth, or 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of underdone roast 
mutton, beef, or chicken minced tine and pounded to a paste ; 
puree of spinach ; mashed cauliiiow(;r to})s ; asparagus-ti})s ; 
stewed celery ; whole- wheat or bran bread, buttered ; junket 
and cream ; rice-and-milk pudding with stewed prune-juic;e ; 
baked apple with cream. 

Fourth Meal, 6. SO P. JI— Milk, 1 or 2 breakfastcupfuls 
(f5viij-xyj), with additional cream ; whole-wheat or bran 
bread, buttered ; stewed fruit. 

For drink : pure water only. No condiment but salt. 

In older children, fed according to the rules already laid 
down, constipation is not so frequent, but when tlie diet is neg- 
lected and the cliild allowed to do as it pleases, it is a very 
common complaint. A glass of watxT, either hot or cold, should 
be given an hour before breakfast. Cream, as well as water, 
should be added to the milk. Barley- or oatmeal-water may at 
times be added to the milk with benefit. Meat broths are laxa- 
tive in their effects when added to this diet. Under eighteen 
months fruit-juices, or after that time perfectly ripe sound fruit, 
especially when taken an- hour before a meal, is very service- 
able. Figs and prunes stewed together are helpful, as are oat- 
meal and bread made from unbolted Hour. In nuich older 
children the management is similar to that recommended for 
adults. 

Holt manages an average case of chronic constipation in a 
child of four years of age as follows : " Massage for eight min- 
utes, morning and night ; the juice of half an orange and a 
glass of A'ichy immediately upon rising ; a breakfast of oat- 
meal, with one ounce of cream, dried bread with butter, an egg, 
half glass of milk with cream and water added ; a dinner of 
soup, one starchy vegetable — i. e., potato with cream — and one 
green vegetable, beefsteak, baked apple or ])runes, dried bread 
and butter, and water to drink ; for supper, cream toast, (.'gg,

dried bread and butter or Graham craokers, lialf glass of milk 
with cream and water added ; a suppository containing nux

Inanition. — Inanition is a term loosely applied to various 
conditions ; it should, however, be restricted to those cases of 
acute starvation coming on in very early life. It is character- 
ized by a loss of weight, and usually by fever as well, and the 
condition is not infrecpiently mistaken for some other disease. 
It follows abstinence from food, such as occurs in those cases 
where inl'ants are abandoned on d(jor-steps, or are grossly neg- 
lected and starved. Other causes are luu'sing at a dry or nearly 
dry brea.-t, in which case the child sie/es the nipple eagerly and 
after several vigorous attempts at sucking drops the nipple, cries, 
and seems to be luieomfortable. (iross errors in feeding, as 
where a child is given a food absolutely unsuited to its needs, 
mav also bring ab(jut this condition. It may occur in infants 
with enfeebled digestion — either those congenitally debilitated 
or tliose rendered so by disease. Sudden change's in food may 
also occasionally cause it. 

Jn the management of these cases, wliich is apt to be difficult, 
tlie same general routine should be followed as is suggested for 
marantic babies. If possible, a wet-niu"se should be secured. 
Holt advises that the breast-milk be diluted with an equal vol- 
ume of water or of lime-water. He also suggests that if there 
is diarrliea, the milk be ])um{)ed from the breasts and the cream 
removed. The ])roportion of fat may gradually be increased. 
When a wet-nurse can not be secured, the child should first be 
given very dilute mixtures, as suggested in the t;il)les on pp. 274 
and '111, or a milk so modified as to be indicated for a child 
much younger than the one in hand. These milk mixtures 
should be partially or completely ])eptonized. The authors 
have used weak milk mixtures to which I*e])togenic Milk Powder 
ha- been added, with benefit. The-e mav be given bv means 
of a boltlc, (.r if the child will n(»t suck, bv means of a medi- 
cinc-diMpper oi" spoon, or l)y gavage if ncc(\<sarv. In all cases 
in wliich a child I'cfu-es to take food a -tomach-tube should be 
pa--cd in onlcr to asc<Ttain if" llic esophagus is patent or not, 
and ihc fancc- -lioiild al-o be examined carefullv both bv >ight 
and 1»\- touch. 

If the peptonized milk i- not well Ixirne, predigested beef 
prej)ai-ation.-. dilnted condensed milk, malted or farinaceous 
fo(»d-, albumin-water, barhy-water, in fact, anv form of food

however, the most apt to prove usefiiL Water, if needed, may 
be given by subcutaneous injection or by the rectum, a normal 
salt solution being best for this purpose. 

Children very small at birth are best treated in the same 
manner as })remature babies. Inanition in older infants may 
often be combated by anowinu: food that would not be permitted 
under ordinary conditions. Solid food suited for a child twice 
the age of the one under treatment sometimes succeeds when 
everything else has failed. 

Marasmus. — JNIarasmus, known also under the names of 
'^ wasting disease of children,^' atlirepsia, and simple atro])hy, 
is best described as a condition of pernicious atrophy. The 
term inanition should be used only for those cases of acute star- 
vation, with their characteristic sym])toms and causes, occurring 
in infants. 

Atrophy in infants may be divided into two clasvses : The 
primary cases, where the cause is unknown, and the secondary 
cases, or those that follow definite pathologic conditions. The 
dividing-line can not at present definitely be drawn. All cases 
occurring in the course of the easily recognized diseases may at 
once be placed in the group of secondary cases — those following 
tuberculosis, for exam})le. Most cases seen clinically occur in 
infants Avho have not had proper food and care. Some authors 
would place these in the list of secondary cases, and consider 
them from another standpoint, regarding the process of nutri- 
tion as twofold — digestion as the first step, and assimilation as 
the second. Under the head of primary atrophy these authors 
would place only those cases in w^hich the second factor was at 
fiult ; or, in other words, tliose cases receiving proper care and 
a physiologically correct diet. This division is, for practical 
purposes, useless ; and since we lack definite information on the 
subject, the cases should be divided, from a pathologic basis, 
into those that exhibit lesions of definite diseases, and those in 
which there are no s])ecial and constant lesions beyond wasting 
of the muscles and body-fat and atrophy of the thymus gland. 

If care is taken to exclude tuberculosis as well as other dis- 
eases, the diagnosis of the condition presents no especial diffi- 
culties. 

In some instances the cause of the disease can not be made 
out, whereas in other instances it is traceable to improper 
feeding, lack of care, insufficient exercise, and, most important, 
lack of fresh air and sunshine. 

When cases are seen reasonably early and if the causes can

})(• rcrocrni/cd an<l remedied, tlie outlook is good. In private 
praetiee cases ainoiiiz: tlie well-to-do usually do well. If seen 
late, the proixnosis is nearly hopc^less, and in asylums and infant 
hornet the outlook i> mo.-t irlooniy. If, when the infant is first 
seen, diti;c,-iive di.-turhances are })resent and can he corrected by 
(licUirv iiica.-ures, the outlook is more hopeful than in those 
(■a--<'s where .-uilicieut I'ood is taken and digested but the child

The ii'catmcut of these cases is essentially dietary and 
hvLdeuic, au<i cither mca-ui'e alone nuist fail. The child must 
be kept warm, and in a well-aired room ; if ])Ossible, it should 
be given -mi-bath- and be taken into the fresh air. In proper 
s<'a-«»ii- of the vear it should be out-of-doors most of the time, 
[)refrrabl\' in the country. The child's body should be mas- 
saircd Li'f'utly once oi' twice daily, u.-ing gentle friction and a 
liibricaiit .-uch a> cucda-butter oi* cocoamit oil. The rul)bing 
nutvenients should always be (lirect(^d toward the heart, so as to 
facilitate circulation. The child should be carried about and 
codiljcd a- much as po^-iblc, for many of these infants are 
,-iar\inL'- for want of a motlier\> love as much as for want of 
foo.j. '{'he child should be \\'^\ while lying on the imrse's lap

of marasmus occur in cliiklren who liave l)C('n al)andon('(l by 
their mothers at birth. If a cliild is nursed at the breast for 
two or four weeks, it is more likely to improve and live than if 
it is taken from the breast inmiediatcly and given uncertain 
milk mixtures. 

Malnutrition. — Malnutrition is a term applied to cases of 
defective nutrition that run a more chronic course than those 
sufferiiio; from inanition or marasnuis. It occurs in infants and 
in older children. In the former the management is similar to 
that of marasnuis ; in the latter, the same general rules ap])ly. 
The life of the child must, so far as possible, be carei'ully 
regulated, and an abundance of fresh air and sunshine, together 
with appropriate exercises and intervals of undistui-bed rest, 
enjoined. The diet is, however, the most important element in 
the treatment. The food should be })Iain and wholesome, cure- 
fully prepared, and given at regular but not too frequent inter- 
vals. In some cases it may be found advisable to give smaller 
meals at shorter intervals. The food should be such as is 
recommended for normal children ; a list of these articles is 
given on pages o()() and 307, where the details of the feeding 
will also be found. 

Feeding- after Intubation. — Usually this is accom- 
plished with but little or no difficulty, but in some instances 
swallowing may at first be difficult, and in these cases semi- 
solids, such as junket, soft-boiled eggs or a very light omelet, 
wine-jelly, or milk-toast, may be substituted for the liquid. If 
the semisolids fail, it has been suggested that the child be placed 
with its head lower than its body, and that nourishment be given 
while in this }K)sition. As soon as the child learns to swallow 
with the tube in place the usual light diet may be giv(Mi. 

!^nuresis. — Besides the training and the medicinal treat- 
ment, a plain, nutritious diet is of great service in these cases. 
In the majority of cases of nocturnal enuresis, on question- 
ing it will be found that the children have been getting larcre 
quantities of coffi^e or tea, or that large amounts of water have 
been taken during the evening, or that the })l;idder has not been 
emptied before going to bed. In these cases the treatment is 
obvious, and consists in excluding coffi'c, tea, and stimulating 
foods (spices and the like), and in limiting the amount of fluid 
taken after four in the afternoon. Much can be done by pro])er 
training. When dependent u])on other causes, the treatment 
must be directed toward these conditions. 

Rachitis or Rickets. — Rickets is a disease of nutrition.

hut (»no that is not well undcr.stood. Most of the cases occur 
in the temperate zone, and southern races transported north 
seem especially predisposed to it. It is very common among 
the neirroes of T>altimon\ The authors have found that 
iicarlv lUU ])<'r cctit. of the iniants in asylums for colored 
children were alfeclccl with I'iehet-, whereas in simihir institu-

time they developed ><'vei-e rickets. They were given milk, 
pounded hone-, and cod-li\-er oil, and in three months, without 
any chauL'"*' in their sui'i-oundintr>, they were cured. Geurin

RACHITIS OR rickets;. 343 

Diet. — The i'eedin^ in rickets is very simple^ and when it is 
possible to combine witli it outdoor life and proper care and 
nursing, is very efficient. If the child must be fed artificially, 
and if it exhibits symptoms that are suggestive, such as sweat- 
ing, tenderness, or restlessness at night, it should be given 
cream or cod-liver oil in addition to the proper diet. \\\ this 
way the disease may be prevented. When the disease has 
developed, the child should be placed on a diet suitable to its 
aire, as suirirested in the section on the Feedimr of Infants ; the 
food should consist in fresh milk, eggs, meat, vegetables, and 
fruit. The basis of the diet should be milk, which should con- 
tain 4 per cent, of fat if the child can digest that amount and 
is old enough to receive it. Fat in some form must be sup])lie(l, 
and where cream is not well borne, other forms maybe tried or 
they may be given in combination. Of these, cod-liver oil is 
one of the most valuable, and may be given plain, in teasjwon- 
ful doses or less, so as not to disturb the digestion. If the 
plain oil is not well borne, it may be given in the form of an 
emulsion or with malt preparations. Fat bacon browned to a 
crisp by dropping small pieces in boiling grease may be tried, 
and will often agree where other fats do not. Btitter may be 
used, but in large amounts this may not be so well borne as the 
other forms. Care should be taken that too much be not given 
and the child's digestion disturbed by excess of fat. 

The hypophosphites may be used for their tonic action, btit 
probably exert no special effect on the disease. Iron or arsenic 
may be used if there is anemia. 

Louis Starr ^ skives the followino: diet-list for a child of q\^\\- 
teen months in which the disease is uncomplicatetl by diarrhea : 

First Meal, 7. -JO A. J/. — A breakfastcupful (8 ounces) of 
milk with a tablespoonful (one-half ounce) of cream ; on alter- 
nate days the yolk of a soft-boiled Ggg, with a little butter, salt, 
and bread-crumbs, and two to four tablespoonfuls of well-cooked 
and strained cracked-wheat porridge with cream and salt. 

Second Meal, 11 A. M. — A breakfastcupful (8 oimces) of 
milk with a tablespoonful (one-half ounce) of cream and a slice 
of whole- wheat bread. 

Third AIe(d, 2 P. J/. — A good tablespoonful of well-minced 
and potmded chicken or mutton, with gravy and a little crumbled 
stale bread ; a tablespoonful of puree of spinach, stew^ed celery, 
or cauliflower tops ; thin bread and butter. 

^ Diseases of the Dujesiive OrgcDis of Cliildren. 



344 INFAXl' FEEDING. 

Fourth Meal, 6 P. 3L — Milk and cream as at first and second 
meals ; thin bread and butter. 

For drink, pure water. 

Avoid excess of farinaceous food. 

Should there be a complicating diarrhea with liquid offensive 
stools, a diet containing a minimum quantity of casein should 
be adopted. For example : 

First Meal, 7 A. M. — Veal broth (half ])ound of veal to a 
pint of water) and barley-water equal parts (3 to 4 ounces). 

Second Meal, 10 A. M. — Cream, half ounce, whey (freshly 
prepared) 6 ounces. 

Third 3Ieal, 1 P. M. — Same as first, with chicken broth in 
j)lace of veal broth. 

Fonrth 3Teal, 5 P. 31. — Same as second. 

Fijth 3kal, 10 P. J/.— Same as first. 

If feeble, one meal at 4 A. :\r., same as second. 

In extreme cases with diarrhea Starr limits the diet to raw 
beef-juice in one to three tablespoonful doses every two liours, 
with a modified brandy-and-egg mixture twice each day. 
(See recipes for Infant Brandy-and-egg Mixture, in the sec- 
tion on Recipes.) 

Intestinal Infantilism. — Herter has described a form of 
dwarfs characterized by an arrest in development, with a flac: 
cidity of the muscles, but with a good grade of mental })ower 
and normal development of the brain, as is evidenced by the size 
and shape of the head. There is also intestinal disturbance, 
usually with large fatty stools and a distended abdomen, due to 
dilatation of the colon. There is a moderate grade of anemia 
and rapid (>nset of ])hysical and mental fatigue. He believes 
the disease to be due to non-absorption of calcium magnesium 
and to the restriction of carbohydrate and fats, due to ])oison- 
ing by the products of certain forms of bacteria Jiot normally 
[)resent in the intestinal tract of young cliildren. Those cases 
where care can be given usually result favorably, anil after ten 
years of age the growth is apt to be rapid. The diet is entirely 
a matter of experiment in eacli individual case. Ilcrter advises 
giving large (juantities of gelatin, in making a corresponding 
decrease in carbohydrates aiid fats, and increasing protein some- 
what over tliat ordinarily taken. Milk is borne well by some, 
])oorly by other cases. Jjuttermilk and fermented milks may 
be useful, particularly in the later stages. 



DIET FOR SPECIAL CONDITIONS. 
DIET FOR THE AGED, 

Whp:n a man has passed liis fiftieth year his diet should be 
guarded. Dietary indiscretions or a too ])lentiiid diet will 
result either in the putting on of flesh and the consequent dis- 
comforts of obesity or in the development of gout or allied 
affections. In considering the diet of the aged the old dictum 
that a man is as old as his arteries applies. Age can 'not (ilvays 
he counted hi/ yecirs. In the aged there is a lessening of all 
physical activities. The old man takes less exercise, has 
diminished powers of digestion, and is less able to absorb the 
nutriment he has digested. His circulation is ])o()r and his 
bowels are constipated. Degenerative processes have taken place 
in his organs, and he is more apt to feel the effects of indis- 
cretions in diet. For these reasons the diet should be lighter 
than in vouno;er vears, and the amount of food eaten should 
vary v/ith the needs of the individual. The food should be of 
an e^asily digestible variety ; it should be given in smaller 
quantities at a time, and the intervals between meals should be 
sliortened. If there is a tendency to obesity, food that is a})t 
to be converted into fat should be given iu diminished aniounts. 
The proteins should be somewhat lessened from time to time. 
The practice of eating heavy suppers late at night and of eat- 
ing between meals should be discontinued. The person should 
learn what particular articles of food disagree with him, and 
refrain from eating foods that tend to cause flatulence. Yeo 
suggests that in the case of cooked fruits a small quantity 
(about a teaspoonful to the pound of fruit) of sodium bicar- 
bonate be stewed with them, to correct the acidity that causes 
flatulence. 

In the aged food bears a close relation to slee]). A cup of 
hot milk, liot toddy, or some hot liquid food taken at bed-time 
will often overcome troublesome sleeplessness. A few sips of 
milk or a mild stimulant taken during the early morning hours, 
when the aged are apt to awaken, w^ill frequently insure sleep 
again. 

345 



346 DIET FOR SPECIAL CONDITIONS. 

Anotlier point of interest is the question of mastication, as 
in the aged the teeth are liable either to be lost entirely or to 
be unfitted for chewing. The rather general use of false teeth 
has largely remedied this, but it may be necessary to point out 
that farinaceous foods, which slip easily and (piickly into the 
stomach, njust either be avoided (jr chewed thoroughly, so as to 
prevent indigestion and flatulence. AVhen tlie teeth are lost, or 
are defective, the food sliould be soft in cliaracter. Meats 
sliould be minced or cut in very small })ieces, or served in soft 
stews, and hard crusts and the like softened by soaking in milk, 
tea, or coffee. Chewing should be insisted on to insalivate the 
starchy foods. 

The digestive abilities of aged people vary greatly, sonu; 
taking but little food and ex])eriencing diiliculty even then, 
wliile others eat a great deal more and seem to enjoy it more 
than they did in their younger years. This latter class some- 
times pave the way for various difficulties later by their inordi- 
nate eating, \\dien they liave high arterial tension, comj)lain 
of giddiness, flushing after meals, and sometimes of nosebleed, 
it is well to limit the amount of food taken ; the same is true 
where there is a tendency to obesity, and old, obese })ersons 
with chronic bronchitis are fre([uently benefitted l)y a carefully 
adjusted diet. 

All com])licated dishes are ])est avoided, tis well as those 
which are highly seasoned or strongly flavored. All foods 
which are lial^le to cause digestive disturbance or toxemia 
should be let alone, as many an old ])erson is carried off by 
])tomaine }>oisoning caused by some gamey food, which one 
with a vigorous digestion might luu'e eaten with impunity. 
Stale canned foods should not be taken at all, and articles of 
diet which the individual knows from expei'ience will cause 
trouble should l)e av(.ided. As pcop](> gi'ow older it is a general 
rule that th(y crave sweets le.-s, and that sugars are less easily 
digested and are moi'c liable to <*au<e indigestion and flatulence. 
AVhenever colic; is complained oi', the sweets should be cut down 
in quantity or avoided altogether, and if this does not remedy 
it, the cause should be >ouglit either in l:ii'iiiace(»us foods or 
vegetables of the cabbage fuuily, or the legume^. 

Foods Suitable for the Aged. — .Milk may be taken 
in all forms when easily dige-ted, and when it is not well l)orne 
the addition of warm \'iehy or warm water will often ])rove 
hel])f"ul, ()r the milk may be diluted with cereal gruels, or ha\'e 



DIET FOR THE AGED. PA7 

sodium citrate (one i>:rain to tlie ounce) added to it. Beef-tea i.s 
often useful and beef juices may also l)e used if desired. I'^gg^, 
lightly cooked or beaten up ^vitll milk, are very useful, as are 
nutritious sou])s, such as chicken or fish purees, mutton, beef, or 
chicken broth. Young and tender chicken, game and other 
tender meats, and good quality potted c!ii<'ken or other potted 
meats may be taken, and sAveetbreads ai'c easily digested if 
fresh and ]M'operly ])repared, but may be contraindicated on 
account of the ])urin nitrogen contained. A\'hite fish, such as 
sole, whiting, smelts, and the like, are all suitable, and are best 
when boiled. Crisp grilled bacon is relished by many. 

The following foods are all suitable : Bread-and-milk made 
with the crumbs of stale bread and without lum[)s. Por- 
ridge and oatmeal gruel. Puddings of ground rice, tapioca, 
arrow-root, sago, macaroni, with milk or og^^, and flavored 
with spices or served with fruit-juice or jelly ; bread and butter, 
the bread to be at least a day old ; rusk, to be soaked in tea or 
milk and water. Prepared foods, consisting of predigested 
starches ; at this age the digestive ferments are ])rovided scan- 
tily by the digestive organs, and soluble carbohydrates are val- 
uable for maintaining the body-heat. All farinaceous foods 
should be subjected to a high temperature for some time during 
the cooking process, so as to render the starch-granules more 
digestible. 

Vegetable purees of all kinds may be taken in moderation — 
e. g., potatoes, carrots, spinach, and other succulent vegetables. 
Potatoes and fresh veg(itables are a necessity ; if omitted, a 
scorbutic state may be engendered. Stewed celery and stewed 
Spanish or Portugal onions lend variety to the diet. Stewed 
or baked fruits, fruit-jellies, and the pulp of perfectly ripe raw 
fruits in small quantity may be taken. 

Dr. George S. Keith, in his Fads of an Old Plujsickm, gives 
the following account of his diet in his old age : 

"For breakfast I have a large cup of tea, with milk or 
cream ; brown bread from two to three ounces ; and usually 
one and a half ounces of fish, or half that quantity, and that 
very rarely, of bacon. Sometimes for a few days I take a cup 
of coffee with lialf milk, but no fish or bacon. Lunch is a 
cup of cocoa or chocolate, if tlie weather be cold ; if it is w^arm, 
a small tumbler of milk, about six ounces, with the same quan- 
tity of bread as at breakf ist. At both meals I use butter, not 
a quarter .of an ounce, and quite as much jelly or marmalade. 
This is mv usual lunch, but occasionallv instead of cocoa I 



348 DIET FOR SPECIAL CONDITIONS. 

have a baked apple, or some prunes with milk, or strawberries 
^\•ith cream so long as I can get them, or very rarely vegetable 
soup. When I have no milk I take usnally a morsel (not half 
an ounce) of cheese. At 4 p. M., a small cu]i of tea, and some- 
times biscuit or cake. For dinner, at 7, which is my chief 
meal, I have soup, from peas, lentils, potatoes, celery, carrots, 
etc., the first two made with no meat stock, and the others 
with a little from lamb or a bone ; or fish soup, the only animal 
soup I indulge in. Fish, mostly white deep-sea fish direct 
from iSIontrose ; of this I take no more than three ounces, with 
a potato and always another vegetable fresh from the garden. 
If there is no fish, I may take once or twice a week an ounce 
or two, certainly not more, of lamb, game, rabbit, or tripe ; 
but often I have neither fish nor flesh. The dinner ends with 
stewed fruit with cream, or pudding, or fruit tart ; of these I 
take a fair helping. During the winter season, instead of fruit 
or pudding, I often have celery, with cheese, oatcake and butter. 
On this diet I enjoy the l)est of health, and for my age (sev- 
enty-eight) am up to a fair amount of exercise, walking three 
to six miles daily in good and sometimes in btid weather, and 
usually part of this is u]) a steep road with a rise of 250 feet. 
The only confession I have to make is that when at home I 
do not rise till T have had breakf ist and read the newspaper. 
This is a habit I have recommended to many approaching my 
own age, and those who have tried it admit that they are 
stronger for the rest of the day. I enjoy breakfast just as 
much as my other meals, though I never feel what can be 
called hunger, and have not done so for many years. I could 
omit a meal at any time without discomfort. This I have 
long looked upon as tlie !)est ])roof of perfect digestion. Dur- 
ing verv warm months 1 take rather less bread and l)utter, and 
I do not try to make this u[) by taking anything else." 

DIET DURING PREGNANCY AND THE 
PUERPERIUM. 

Diet during Pregnancy. — Under ordiuaiy cipMimstances 
no (ithcr diet than that to which the jtaticnt is accustomed is 
Jidvisable. The food -hould be ph-ntilul and nourishing. All 
highly seasoned food and indigestible articles are to be avoided, 
as are all articles which are known to disagi-ee with the ])atient. 
When there is a morbid craving for unsuitable things the 
j)atient should l)e carel'ully guarded against indulging her a])i)e- 



DIET DURING PREGNANCY AND THE PUERPERIUM. 349 

tite. Special diets may })e ordered for patients with diabetes 
or heart disease, or where tlie })atient is gouty, over-fat, anemic, 
or chlorotic. Prochownick ^ has called especial attention to 
these conditions. 

Diet in Obesity and Pregnancy. — In general, the diet 
is the same as advised in obesity. This should be combined 
with exercise, either walking or light gymnastics and massage, 
which should not, however, be given over the abdomen. Tiie 
diet should consist of meat, fish, green vegetables, fruit, and a 
small allowance of carbohydrates. Prochownick allows 4 or 5 
ounces (120-150 grams) daily. Fruit is permitted, but should 
not be eaten in too large quantities nor to relieve thirst. The 
amount of fluid should be restricted to a pint or a pint and a 
quarter (500-600 ccm). Prochownick allows a moderate 
amount of fat, as cream and butter, but not fat sauces. S()U])s, 
sweets, spirits, and preserves are to be avoided. The follo^ving 
is a sample dietary as advised l)y Prochownick : 

7.00 A. M. — Four ounces (125 ccm.) coffee with milk; 1 J 
ounces (40 grams.) bread and butter ; 1 or 2 eggs ; a little fruit. 
Before or after this 40 to 45 minutes walking. 

10.00 A. 31. — Massage or gymnastics. 

10.30 A, M. — Fruit ; 1 egg ; a very small slice of bread and 
butter. 

Midday. — Roast or boiled meat or fish ; vegetables, no beets 
or peas; salad; cheese; fruit; 4 ounces (125 ccm.) water or 
wine and water. No afternoon nap. 

4-.00 P. 31. — A small cup of coffee or tea, not over 3 ounces 
(100 ccm.) ; a very small slice of bread and butter ; an egg, if 
necessary. Walk for an hour or an hour and a half. 

7.S0 P. 31. — Eggs or cold meat; 4 to 6 ounces (125-200 
ccm.) tea or milk ; 1 to 2 ounces (40-60 grams) bread ; butter ; 
fruit or salad. 

Thirst is usually complained of early in the treatment. The 
diet should be varied to suit the patient, and the routine 
should be so arranged as not to be disagreeable to the patient. 
The result of the lowered amount of fluid and carbohydrate, 
together with the exercise and massage, is to reduce the amount 
of fat, tone up the system, and to ])roduee a small child, so that 
labor is made easier. The urine should be examined from time 
to time and the patient should be weighed. 

Prochownick' s Diet in Pelvic Contraction. — Accord- 
ing to Prochownick, Florschiitz, and others, a diet deficient in 

^ Therapeutische Monatschrifte, 1901. 



350 DIET FOR SPECIAL CONDITIONS. 

carbohydrates and fluids will result in a small child without 
otherwise influencing its development, a view which lias been 
conflrmed by Patton in England. The diet is advised in women 
who have previously borne very large children and in women 
witli contracted pelves. In the latter, Prochownick does not 
advise the diet when the conjugata vera is below 8 cm., but 
there are instances where the child \vas born alive and well with 
the conjugata vera 7, 5, 7, and even G.5 c. m. By following 
his })lan diflicult labor may often be obviated, and even the 
induction of premature labor unnecessary. The diet may be 
begim ten or twelve weeks before the birth is expected, and 
after the first week or two should be rigidly followed. Fi*aenkel 
advises beginning four or five months before delivery. The 
average diet consists of 140 to 1()0 grams of protein, 80 to 130 
grams of fat, and 100 grams of carbohydrates, altogether a 
value of 1800 to 2000 calories. The fluid should be restricted 
to about oOO ccm. per dav. Prochownick's original diet' is as 
follows: 

J>r('((I:fa8f. — One small cup of coflee (3 oz.— 100 ccm.); zwie- 
back or bread (1 ounce-2o grams) ; a little butter. 

Dinner. — Any kind of meat, o^ii^, or fish, with little sauce ; 
green vegetables prepared with fat (as cream) ; salad ; cheese. 

S}ipj)cr. — Same as dinner, with 1 to P^ ounces (40-r)() grams) 
bread, and as much butter as desired. 

Ahmbdcly forbidden. — AVater, sou})s, j^otatoes, desserts, sugar, 
and beer. 

J)rink per day. — Red or moselle wine, 9 to 12 ounces (300- 
400 ccm.). 

All the mothers bore this diet well after getting used to it. 
Thirst was com])lained of during the early ])art of the treat- 
ment, and is es])ecinlly n()tic(>able in lat Momeii. Some object 
to the large (juantities of animal food, but this is overcome by 
the use of green vegetables and salads. All the confinements 
reported have ])een easier than on previous occasions, even wheti 
the child was large and fit, and all the children were born alive 
even though the majority of the mothers had had ])revious mis- 
carriages. The children were lean at birth, with the bones of 
the head unusually mobile. The children were all apparently 
mature in everv way. In the majoi'ity of instances the child 
gained normally after birth, and the diet apparently had no bad 
influence on lactation. The urine should be examined regularly 
and the amount of urea estimated. It has been sugLTcsted that 
* C-nlnilblatt Jilr Gyndhdoijlc, 1889, 33. 



DIET DURING PREGNANCY AND THE PUERPERIUM. 361 

such a diet would favor eclampsia, but this has not been borne 
out clinically. 

Diet during: the Puerperium. — Formerly great restric- 
tions were placed on the diet of a recently delivered woman, 
thus accounting, in part, for the loss of weight that has been 
noted. If there is no nausea and the patient desires it, a cup 
of tea or a glass of warm milk may be given soon after delivery. 

The appetite is generally poor for a few days after delivery, 
but food should be given at regular intervals not too widely 
separated. The first day, milk, milk-toast, or, if desired, dry 
or buttered toast, with coffee, tea, or cocoa, according to the 
taste of the patient, may be given. Water may be allowed as 
desired. On the second and third days simply soups or any 
of the following may be added to the dietary : ^leat broths, 
beef-tea, soft-boiled or poached eggs, raw or ste^ved oysters, 
and some simple dessert, such as wine-jelly, boiled custard, or 
junket. During the next few days chicken, scraped beef or 
mutton in small quantities, baked potato, rice, and cereals may 
be given, and by the end of the week a gradual return to the 
ordinary diet may be made. 

DIET IN THE SPECIAL DISEASES OF PREGNANCY. 

I/Owered Urea Output. — During pregnancy the urine 
should be watched closely, and an examination for albumin be 
made weekly, especially if there is the slightest reason to sus- 
pect kidney disease. If albumin is found or if any untoward 
symptoms arise, the urea output for twenty-four hours should 
be estimated. If the quantity excreted is below normal, the 
patient should be put at once on a milk diet, the milk generally 
being skimmed (see Milk Cure and Diet in Xephritis). If the 
patient tires of this, lettuce salad and bread and butter may 
be allowed in addition, together with zwieback or biscuits 
(crackers). Very small (piantities of herring roe may be given 
as a relish. An abundance of water, either jilain water or 
what is know^n as Buffalo Lithia Water, should be drunk. 
Cream-of-tartar lemonade (one dram to the pint) is also useful 
as a beverage. 

Salivation. — If this occurs, the patient should be put 
upon a rigorous milk diet. 

Gingivitis. — In this condition a generous, well-mixed diet, 
including fruit and fresh vegetables, is indicated. In addition 
tonics and astringent mouth-washes, especially those containing 
the tincture of myrrh, are to be prescribed. 



352 DIET FOR SPECIAL COyDITIONS. 

Pernicious Vomiting-. — This is often associated with 
diseased conditions of the kidney. Whatever the canse, the 
patient shonhl be kept in bed and pUiced upon a restricted 
diet, consisting of peptonized milk and similar preparations, 
given in small quantities at intervals of three or four hours, or 
even oftener. Rectal feeding may be em])loyed for several 
davs, the patient being given little or nothing by the mouth. 
High injections of salt solution help to allay thirst and to 
control the condition itself. AVhen the vomiting has ceased, 
the return to an ordinary diet should be slowly and carefully 
made. 

Aberrant Mental Conditions during Pregnancy. — 

The patient should l)e placed in bed, if possible, and excretion 
])romote(l by means of baths and the like. An exclusive milk 
diet (or one that is nearly so) is generally to be preferred. 

THE EFFECT OF DIET ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND 
STRUCTURE OF THE UTERUS. 

^lalcolm Camj))jell ' has di-awn tlie ibllowiug deductions from 
his experiments on rats: ]. The use of a non-])hysiological 
diet — i'or example, exclusive He.-h, I'ire, or porridge — induces in 
the great majority of cases a modification in the structure of the 
uteriue nuicous membrane. Thi> modilication consists m a 
diiuiuution in the nuuiberof large counectivet-issue type of cells, 
which a])pear to be imj)ortaut constituents in a })hysiologically 
active nmc«)-a. 2. I'hc sti'uctural change is m()>t ])ro:^bund in 
animals led iVom weaning on an cxclusixely ox-ilesh diet. In 
such animals the development of the uterus is also most interfered 
with. .'i. 11ie structural cliange is as.-ociated with sterility. 
Watson has ])oint(-<l ont that a me;it diet, il' begun at weaning, 
almost invarinbly led t(» -teriHty, which is probal)ly due to the 
structural deveh)pinental abnormalities in the titerus induced by 
the abnormal diet. ('ampbell also calls attention to the fact 
that the consum])tion oj" meat per head in Kngland and Scot- 
land is almost .seventeen times as Lii'eat as it M'as in 17o<). 
l)uriiig the ,-ame time there ha- been a marked fall in the birth 
rate. 



SPECIAL METHODS OF FEEDING. 

RECTAL FEEDING* 

Nutrient Bnemata. — The administration of food by the 
rectum is a method of feeding of ancient origin. iEtius and 
others mention it, and writers during the Middle Ages have re- 
ferred to it, though not in very glowing terms, their imperfect 
technic probably resulting in practical failure. Voit and Bauer 
found that a doom's rectum would not absorb es^sr-albumin and 
water unless sodium chlorid were mixed with it. Meat-juice 
and peptone solutions have been recommended, but on account 
of their cost are not in common use. Yon Leube advised the 
use of albumin to which chopped pancreas has been added. 
His formula was as follows : 150-300 grams (5-10 oz.) of 
scraped and finely chopped beef; 50-100 grams (lJ-3 oz.) of 
finely chopped ])ancreas (of the cow and hog), free from fat ; 
150 c.c. (5 oz.) of lukewarm water. The mixture is to be 
stirred until a lukewarm mass results. If desired, fat may be 
added — 25-50 grams (about 1-1 J oz.). It is best to allow 
the mixture to stand for some time in a warm place before 
using. The prepared pancreas extracts, either dry or liquid, 
now on the market, may be substituted for the chopped pan- 
creas. Ewald showed that this procedure was unnecessary, 
and that albumin that was not peptonized or pancreatized 
could be absorbed, especially if a small quantity of salt was 
added. This last seems to cause reverse ]:»eristalsis, and Griitzner 
has shown that substances introduced with the salt solution may 
be found in the stomach, a fact that has been confirmed by 
Swieznski. 

Bauer believes that but one-fourth of the nutriment needed 
by the body can l^e absorbed by the rectum, and both he and 
the earlier writers placed the limit of time during which rectal 
feeding was practicable at from one to two weeks. With care- 
ful technique, this period may be extended from four to six 
weeks, depending on the capacity of the individual for continued 
al)sorption, and on the amount of energy stored up in his body 
at the beginning of the rectal feeding ; but von Leube has kept 
a patient alive for six months, and Riegel for ten months, on

the form of somatose is said to be very well absor})ed. The 
results of some observers do not allow for the possibility of 
bacterial decomposition in the large bowel^ changing the pro- 
teins into products of no nutritive value. 

Fats are^ according to most (»l)serverSj not absorbed in very 
large amounts. Deucher states that 10 grams of fat a day are 
absorbed with ditliculty even under favorable conditions, and 
tliat it is favored by the addition of salt. T\\q greater the 
amount of fat given, the greater amount will be absorbed, and, 
owing to its high food value, fat helps out very mucli in rectal 
feeding. More recent investigators think fat better absorbed 
by the bowel than is ordinarly believed. Saponiiied fats have 
been suggested, but apparently yolk of egg is the most valuable 
form to use. The yolks of two fresh eggs may b(* added with 
advantage to most rectal enemata. 

Tlie carl>ohydrates are especially valuable, and are absorbed 
l)etter than the other food elements. Boyd and ]\()bertson 
found that as much as nine-tenths of the sugar used was 
absorbed. Solutions of from 10 to 20 per cent, are used, and 
as much as 40 or 50 grams may be so administered, although 
oO grams is, perhaps, a safer quantity, being less liable to cause 
pain in the abdomen and looseness of the bowel. Pure dex- 
trose, pure glucose, orpiu'c dextrin seem to give the best results, 
and if irritati<m or sourness of the stool occurs, it may be pre- 
vented by adding one ])art thymol to each 4000 ])arts of the 
enema. It is difficult to state just how far bacterial action 
destroys these carbohydrates in the bowel. 

Alcohol is a])])arently well absorbed in 0.5 to !2 ])er cent, 
solutions, and is a valuable adjunct to nutritive enemata. It 
would seem that it increases the absorbability of the other con- 
stituents of an enema. Salt may be added with advantage up 
to 1 per cent, and seems to aid in absorption. 

The success of the method dej)ends largely on proper technic. 
With poor technic the rectum soon becomes irritable, and for 
this reason rectal feeding should not be intrusted to the nurse 
or the family, but the physician himself should see that it is 
properly conducted. In hospitals or in private ]n'actice wdiere 
the nurse has been specially trained general directions may 
suffice, but in any case ex])licit written directions are advisable. 
Once the rectum becomes irritable the process is conducted with 
difficulty. 

Procedure. — The rectum should be cleansed thoroughly bv 



356 SPECIAL METHODS OF FEEDING. 

administeriDg a high injection of normal salt solntion one hour 
before the enema is to be given. This cleansing should be 
practised at least once a day, and if much mucus is present, it 
may be well to precede each feeding by a cleansing enema. If 
the rectum is inflamed, a solution of boric acid may be used 
instead of the salt solution, or if there is much mucus, a solu- 
tion of sodium bicarbonate may be employed — a teaspoonful 
of either to the pint of water being sufficient. For the first 
one or two cleansing enemata the bowel should be flushed by 
the ordinary method ; later a return-flow catheter may be used ; 
with this several quarts of solution may be used ; without it 
\ to 1 pint will be sufficient in most cases. 

The temperature of the cleansing enemata should be between 
95° and 99° F. ; that of the enemata which are to be retained, 
between 90° and 95° F. Solutions that are too hot or too cold 
will promptly be rejected. 

The patient should lie on his side, with the hips well elevated. 
On account of disease this position may be impracticable. A 
rectal tube or a large catheter should be used. This should 
not, however, be too large ; a tube 1 cm. (about half an inch 
or less) being the proper size for an adult. For children the 
tube should be proportionately smaller. It should be lubricated 
thoroughly, but glycerin should not be used for this purpose. 

In introducing the tube, it should be twisted slightly, which 
lessens the liability of its becoming impacted in the rectal folds. 
If it is not passed easily, a small quantity of the fluid should 
be allowed to flow in, which will serve to balloon out the 
rectum, after which the tube may usually be ])assed with ease 
for eis^ht or ten inches or more. The tul)e should in all cases 
be introduced as high up as possible, as the enema is thus more 
likely to be retained and absorbed. Theoretically, too, it is 
urged that the ])l()od from the lowest part of the rectum is 
returned through the vena cava, whereas that from the higher 
parts returns by way of the portal system and passes directly 
through the liver. This is of no })ractical moment here, as 
sugar solutions absorbed from the rectum, ev^en when introduced 
into the lower portion, do not cause glycosuria. This is ex- 
plained by the fact that the lower portion of the rectum has 
a small ca])acity and absorl)s but little. 

The fluid should be allowed to flow in slowly from a funnel 
or a fountain-syringe. In some instances, where very small 
injections are l)eing used, a small hard-rubber syringe may be

attached to tlie tube. Care should hv taken to avoid injeetiM<^ 
air with the fluid. The method of adrniiiisterini:: nutrient 
enemata by means of tlie ohl-fashioned short hard-rubl)er nozzle 
of either a piston or a Davidson syrinp' can not be too strontrjy 
condemned. In the hands of the unskilful it may cause injury 
to the rectum, and even if used by a trained nurse, onlv suc- 
ceals in placing the fluid in the lower part of the rectum, where 
it is apt to be expelled. 

After the injection the patient should lie as (piietlv as ])ossible 
for at least an hour, and be instructed to try to retain the contents 
of the bowel. A pad of gauze or a towel should be j)ressed 
over the anus for twenty minutes or half an hour, and the mind 
should, if possible, be diverted from the subject. After a few 
days the bowel often acquires a tolerance for the injections, and 
they may be retained without difficulty. 

If the rectum is irritable and the fluid njected, it is well to 
precede the nutrient enema by a small suppository containing 
opium, or, what is better, a small rectal injection of the tincture 
of opium may be given. This may be mixed with a little 
starch water, but the whole should be as small as possible. 
The opium should not be used unless necessary, and the dose 
should be just sufficient to quiet the bowel ; or the opium may 
be added directly to the enema. 

If there are hemorrhoids, rectal feedinir will be areatlv inter- 
fered with. Before each injection they may be painted with a 
2 per cent, cocain solution, and between the feeding a soothing 
ointment should be applied. 

The amount to be given at each injection is an inqxtrtant 
factor. As a rule, it should not exceed ] of a liter, [}, pint). 
If this is not well borne, the amount may be reduced to from 
30 to 100 c.c. (1-3 oz.). 

The number of enemata to be used will de])end somewhat 
upon the patient's constitution; as a general rule, live, or 
better six, hours should be allowTd to elapse between each 
feeding. 

It is well to remember that ])acking in the vagina and other 
gynecologic dressings may interfere materially with the injection 
of fluid into the bowel. 

The patient's mouth should be kept very clean, and the patient 
may be allowed to rinse it from time to time, to hel}) to allay 
the thirst, which is usually intense. Undei" s(^me circumstances 
water may be taken into the stomach, but where absolute rest 



358 SPECIAL METHODS OF FEEDING. 

of the stomach is indicated, not even that should be allowed, 
Enemata of weak salt solution may be given to relieve thirst, or 
salt solution may be given subcutaneously. 

A part of the good effect of the nutrient enemata is the men- 
tal satisfaction following them, similar to that following a meal. 
The patient having also the feeling that he is not being allowed 
to starve. 

Prevention of Parotitis during Rectal Feeding. — 
Fenwick suggests that in order to prevent tlie occurrence of 
parotitis, it is w(^ll to promote continual secretion of saliva with 
the idea of irrigating the ducts and so preventing an ascending 
infection. After experimenting with various tilings, upon which 
the patient was directed to chew, he settled on an india-rubber 
teat about 2 inches in length, with tlie result that the mouth 
remained clean and moist. He has used tliis sim})le device in 
more than -JOO cases, and where the gland was not already in- 
flamed at the outset he had no trouble in any of his cases. 

INDICATIONS FOR THE USE OF NUTRIENT ENEMATA. 
Nutrient enemata are indicated : 

1. In extremely weakened conditions, as during the progress 
of fevers, when tlie quantity of food taken through the mouth 
is insufficient to sustain life or when even predigested food can 
not be retained. 

2. In diseases of the pharynx and esophagus in which ob- 
structions to the passage of food exist, as from tumors; also 
occasionally in spasmodic constrictions of the esopliagus and in 
paralytic conditions of the pharynx when tlie patient is unable 
to swallow food. 

3. In diseases of the stomach, as in cancer occasioning 
stricture of the cardiac orifice, with inability to swallow suffi- 
cient nourishment. In diseases of the stomach in which it is 
important to relieve the stomach of work — e. r/., in carcinoma, 
in non-malignant strictures of the pylorus with conseriuent 
dilatation, and also in ulcer of the stomach, both when hemor- 
rhage has occurred and when liquids are badly borne. In that 
form of nervous dysj)e]isia known as irritable stomach, which is 
accompanied by severe vomiting, nutrient enemata maybe given 
to sup})ly nourishment to tlu; body when the stomach can not 
retain Ibod. 

4. In delirious, comatose, or insane ])ersons who can not be 
fed tlirouirh the mouth.

Nutrient Bnemata by the Drop Method. — Since 
Murphy's introduction of continuous })roctoclysis by the drop 
method the administration of nutrient enemata by the same 
plan has been practised by various clinicians. Eberhard has 
recently called especial attention to this method of treatment. 
His apparatus consists of an ordinary quart can, inside of which 
is placed another can holding a pint. These are connected by 
an 8-inch pipe, which penetrates the bottom of each and 
projects about 2 inches. A small ])et-cock soldered to the 
base of the outside can allows water to be withdrawn at will. 
Milk and e^^ or any other nutriment placed in the smaller 
can is kept warm and flows freely on account of its being sur- 
rounded by hot water. Water at a temperature of 110° to 
115° F. seems to answer all purposes. The remainder of the 
apparatus is the same as used for saline enteroclysis. To in- 
sure absorption the bowel must be cleansed by an enema each 
day. The flow must be regulated to about a drop a second. 
According to Eberhard, in one and a half hours ten ounces of 
milk and two raw eggs flow into the bowel. 

Eberhard has had the best results from the following enemata : 

Albumin of three ejjgs 90 calories. 

Peptonized milk, 9 ounces 174 "

OTHER METHODS OF NOURISHING THE BODY. 

Duodenal Alimentation. — Einhorn, Morgan, and others, 
following the suggestion of the first-named investigator, have 
used a duodenal tube, not only as a matter of diagnosis, but 
for feeding certain classes of cases. At present the tube has 
been used in those cases in wliich it was thought desirable 
to rest the stomach, as in cases of persistent vomiting and 
in certain gastric and duodenal ulcers. The ordinary Ein- 
horn tube is used, and care should be taken to see that 
it is in place before the feeding is started. This may be 
done by gentle traction, which shows a slight resistance if the 
tube is in the duodenum ; by aspiration, which will often bring 
up golden yellow duodenal juice without any gastric secretion ; 
or, ])erhaps best, by giving tlie patient some liquid to drink 
by mouth and immediately performing aspiration. If the end 
of the tube is in the stomach, the fluid can be recovered. Any 
liquid food may be employed, but mixtures of milk, sugar, and 
raw eggs are the most useful. Care should be taken to see that 
there are no particles in the food that might clog the tube. The 
amount at the beginning should be small, 100 c.c. every two 
hours, beginning early in the morning and stopping late in the 
evening. This quantity may be gradually increased up to 300 
c.c. If 8 feedings are given in twenty-four hours, and each 
feeding consists of 280 c.c. of milk, 1 egg, and 1 tablespoonful 
of sugar of milk, the ])atient will receive approximately 2280 
calories, which is ample for an average individual, and if the 
patient is at rest in bed, it is sufficient to allow a gain in 
weight. 

Einhorn has perfected a special syringe with which it is 
possible to administer the food without disconnecting the tube. 
Morgan has suggested a method like that of Murjihy for giving 
salt solution per rectum, ])ermitting the fluid to flow from an 
irrigating jar, and so arranging the pet-cock that the food is 
taken slowly, the 300 c.c. of nourishment taking about twenty- 
five minutes. The food should be administered at body tempera- 
ture, and the heating should be done slowly, as if it becomes too 
hot it is liable to become thick and lumpy. After heating it is 
well to strain the food to be certain to have it free from small 
])articles. If the food is used too warm or too cold it is apt 
to cause uncomfortable symptoms, sonu^times causing the ])atient 
considera1)le sliock ; a too rapid administration causes flatu- 
lence. After each feeding the svringeful of water, at 98° F.,

tube, and this may necessitate its remo\ah 'V\\\> method of 
ieeding should not he used outside ot" the hospital, nnle— ; it i- 
done by a nurse who has been specially trained Ibr the pui-po-e. 
In unskilled hands mistakes are very liable to be made, which 
cause the })atieut great discomfort. 

Food suppositories have been suggested, but their n>e is 
open to many objections, the chief one, they may not be al)sorhed. 

Nutrient inunctions, especially with oils, have been >ug- 
gested, and in conditions of great emaciation they may prove 
useful. The body is rubbed with oil, such as olive oil, cod- 
liver oil, or cocoanut oil, or with cocoa-butter. This keej)s the 
skiu soft, the massage also proving helpfid. It is of particular 
value in marantic infants, and has been used as a routine ])ractice 
by the authors in all such cases, with very gratifying results. 

Intravascular feeding has been tried. According to 
Thompson, Hodder, as early as 1850, used intravascular injec- 
tions of milk for the collapse of Asiatic cholera. (Others have 
used milk and peptone solutions. Normal salt solution woidd, 
however, seem to be a safer and a more jn'actical method of 
getting fluid into the body. Intravascular feeding will always 
be attended with too many difficulties and (lang(n's to be (»f valuc^ 
to the practitioner. 

Subcutaneous feeding is a stibject of considerable in- 
terest, and \vas used as early as 18()9 by Menzel and Pcrlvo. 
Karst, Kriig, Witthaker, and others have also employed this 
method. One of the most im])ortant contributions to the sub- 
ject has been made by von Leube. This observer could obtain 
no good results from the use of either ])roteins or of cai-bo- 
hydrates. He is of the opinion, however, that injections of oil 
are of practical value in nourishing patients luider such con- 
ditions as render it necessary, as in the failure of rectal enemata 
because of the presence of hemorrhoids or irritation of the rec- 
tum. His attention was directed to the fact that large quan- 
tities of oil were used in giving camj)hor injections, which are 
more widely used in Germany than in America. Fat emboli 
result so rarely as to be practically no objection to the method. 
Von Leube uses the purest olive or sesame oil, and a 10 c.c 



364 SPECIAL METHODS OF FEEDING. 

syringe, made after the ordinary hypodermatic syringe pattern, 
or a needle, a tube, and a funnel. From 30 to 40 c.c. (1-1 J oz.) 
of oil may be used daily. The contents of the syringe (10 c.c.) 
should be injected in three different places and the wounds sealed 
with collodion. The oil should be injected very slowly, and, of 
course, the strictest asepsis must be observed. 

Lennander, of Upsala, and various others have suggested the 
use of solutions of glucose, in varying strengths, from 3 to 8 
per cent., in normal salt solution ; in some cases from 1 to 2 
j)er cent, of alcohol is also added. These solutions are used 
under the skin or in the rectum, and as much as 2 liters have 
been administered in twenty-four hours, giving a total of 160 
grams of sugar and 40 grams of alcohol. Kausch has used 
this solution intravenously, and has recommended it particu- 
larly after operations on the abdomen, and especially in suppu- 
rative peritonitis. From 100 to 200 grams of olive oil may 
be injected subcutaneously at the same time, the whole afford- 
ing a fair amount of available nutritive material. Sugar solu- 
tions have also been used locally in the peritoneal cavity in the 
treatment of suppurative inflammation. 

Saline Irrigations and Infusions. — 1. Saline Rectal 
Irrigations. — Rectal saline injections are especially useful in 
all conditions associated with hemorrhage ; also in the various 
infectious diseases, as well as in intoxications and in those con- 
ditions in which it is necessary to allay thirst. 

The fluid used should be a normal salt solution, and should 
be given high, with the rectal tube ; if it is necessary to prepare 
such a solution quickly, a teaspoonful of salt may be added to 
a pint of water, and rapidly injected by means of an ordinary 
fountain syringe. The fluid should be at about the temperature 
of the body, and should be administered slowly, while the 
patient is in a reclining position. As much as J to 1 quart of 
the fluid can be utilized at one time. 

The Murphy Method for Administering Solutions 
by Rectum. — A very useful method of administering salt 
solutions and other fluids is by the continuous proctoclysis by 
the drop method as suggested by Murphy. This may be used 
whenever it seems advisable to increase the amount of fluid in 
the system. It is of particular service when there has been a 
loss of blood, and also useful to fill u]) the system so that 
further lymphatic absorption is impossil)le, as after operations 
about the thyroid. It may also be used when fluids cannot be 
taken by the stomach. Normal salt solution may be used or 



OTHER METHODS OF NOURISHINii THE BODY. 3G5 

the solution advised by Murphy, a dram each of sodium ehlorid 
and caknum chh)rid to the pint of water. Jn eases of great 
weakness, whisky or an infusion of cotfee may be added to the 
salt solution. 

The method of administering the fluid is important. A 
fountain syringe or a salt solution flask, with a rubber tube 
attachment terminating in a vaginal hard rubl)er tip, or a 
catheter, may be used. After the insertion of tlie ti{) or cath- 
eter into the rectum, the flask is filled with s:dt solution and 
suspended from 4 to 10 inches above the level of the rectum 
of the patient. The solution is kept in a temperature of lOO"^ 
F. by surrounding the flask with hot-water bags. An im- 
provement on this is to use one of the simple devices which are 
on the market for regulating the drop. This may be done by 
using a funnel, and so regulating the pet-cock on the flask that 
the fluid escapes a drop at a time. The devices just mentioned 
are more satisfactory and require less attention. Care and 
judgment should be used not to overload the patient with water 
and so overburden the heart. 

Plain Water Injections. — In place of using normal salt 
solution, ordinary water may be used, as suggested by Lawson, 
1908, and more recently by Trout. The advantages of the 
plain water are that it is absorbed in larger quantities and more 
rapidly. Patients given salt solution by rectum re(piire nearly 
twice as much water by mouth to relieve thirst as those given 
plain water. 

The patient does not complain of tasting salt, as is often the 
case when salt solutions are used. In peritoneal cases in which 
there is drainage, larger quantities of salt solution or plain water 
may be used than under other circumstances. 

Other Solutions. — Foods of various kinds, as mentioned 
above, may be administered by this method, and glucose solu- 
tions, 30 grams (1 ounce) to the liter of wat(M-, or normal 
salt solution may be used to advantage, especially in cases of 
threatened or developed acidosis, as in diabetes or following 
anesthesia. 

2. Saline Infusions. — Saline infusions are given subcu- 
taneously, and are especially useful in cases in which rectal 
saline UTigations can not be utilized, as in certain intestinal dis- 
eases or when an immediate effect is required, as in sudden col- 
lapse from hemorrhage or from shock. They are also useful in 
cases when large quantities of fluids have been lost by the body, as 
in the diarrheas of dysentery and of cholera, in various infectious 



3G6 SPECIAL METHODS OF FEEDING. 

conditions and intoxications, as in pneumonia, erysipelas, and 
typhoid fever ; and in tlie uremia of chronic Bright's disease. 
The most convenient location for administering the infusion is 
between the chest- wall and the manmiary gland, or deeply into 
some muscle, as in the lumbar region, abdominal wall, or but- 
tock. The injection should be given under the most aseptic 
])recautions. No apparatus is required beyond a fountain 
syringe to which an aspirating needle is attached. Tlie in- 
fusion should be warm, and should be allowed to run in slowly; 
frequently as much as 1 or 2 quarts can be injected into one 
place. The mixture used is a normal — O.G per cent. — salt solu- 
tion. In certain cases Gushing ^ prefers th(^ following solu- 
tion : 

Sodium chlorid 0.900 

Calcium chlorid 0.026 

Potassium chlorid 0.010 

Distilled water 99.064 

100.000 

Combs lias re})orted a fatal case of sodium chlorid poisoning. 
By mistake 1 litre of saturated salt solution was ingested hvpo- 
dermically. When seen four hours later she was comatose. 
After about six hours of r-oma, a period of excitation followed, 
she was maniacal, and talked incoherently. This condition per- 
sisted for twenty-four hours, when she died — 124.4 gm. (1920 
(^v.) of sodium chlorid had been used.

DIET IN DISEASE. 

General Rules for Feeding- the Sick. — I he nur-cand 
family should be iiilly impressed with the iniportaiiec of the 
proper feeding of tiie patient. Deiinite dii-ectioiis as to how 
mueh food, its Ibrm, its pre})aration, and ho\v often it is to l)e 
given, should be written out. In all aeute serious condition.-, as 
in pnenm(mia or in typhoid fever^ a record of these details 
should be kept, together with the record of the (piantitv of 
fiuid taken, the medicines given, etc. 

There is usually a tendency to err in either extreme — that of' 
giving either too much or too little food. Care should be taken 
that the patient's wishes are, wherever practicable, carried into 
eifect. The nurse and family should be (piestioned carefullv as 
to the patient's likes and dislikes, and also as to his idiosyncra- 
sies. A tactful, observing nurse is of inestimal)le v:ihie, but a 
careless or stupid one is an ever-present source of danger. 

The training of nurses in regard to feeding is (A\rn fauhv. 
Every nurse should be instructed in the subject of pi'nctical 
dietetics, and should know how much ibod is reciuircd bv the 
different ty])es of ])atients. The details of feeding patients 
should always be gone into. 

The food should be given at regular intervals. In uncon- 
scious or semiconscious patients tliis is of gr(nit importaiice, but 
it is just as important in the conscious, as the aj)petite usually 
comes on at certain times, and if the meal is not forthcoming, 
may disappear. 

The appetite of the conscious patient and of the convalestH'ut 
should be fostered, and nothing done that may in any way <lis- 
turb it. Patients vary much in this particnhii', but as a rule 
individuals who are not overfastidious wlien tiny are well, 
become so when weakened by disease. 

The sick-room should be orderly, an.d no di>h(><, utensils, or 
food be allowed to stand about the room either bcibre or after 
using. All food and drink should be oifered {nmi scrupulously 
clean glasses or dishes. These should be as dainty as ])ossibl(\, 
and the food must be made attractive in apjiearance ; when the 
dish permits, it may be garnished with a sprig of green. The 

?,G7 



368 DIET IN DISEASE. 

Dapkins and linen should be spotless. The exterior surface of 
glasses and cups should be wij^ed dry before they are offered to 
the patient. 

Food that is stale or that has acquired an unpleasant taste 
from standing in a refrigerator together with other things should 
not be given. A strong ^^g in an eggnog may be the means of 
turning a patient forever against this form of nourishment. 
The food should be tasted by the nurse^ but never, when possi- 
ble, in the patient's presence or with the same spoon. If there 
is anything wrong with a dish, this should be discovered and 
remedied before it is brought to the patient. 

A nurse should always remember the eternal fitness of things. 
Utensils and dishes should be used only for the ])urpose for 
which they are intended, and not as makeshifts for other articles. 
After caring for the patient or removing evacuations sufficient 
time should be allowed to elapse before feeding is begun. The 
patient should be made to feel that the utmost cleanliness and 
care have been observed. The hands and face of the patient 
should be wiped with a moist cloth and then dried before food 
is given, and the lips cleansed after the meal is complete. 

The position of the patient should be as comfortable a one as 
possible, and one in which he will not tire before the meal is 
ended. If the patient is weak, the food should be given in 
such form that he may take enough of it without inducing 
fatigue ; otherwise he may become tired of masticating and 
swallowing and take an insufficient amount. Patients who can 
sit up in bed should be provided Avitli a bed-tray on which to 
place the f )od. The legs should l)e j^laced high enough for the 
patient to eat comfortably from it. 

If the patient is helpless, care should be exercised in giving 
food so that it will not be drawn into the lungs during inspira- 
tion or coughing. This may l)e avoided ])y giving the food 
slowly, and by seeing that each mouthful is swallowed before 
anotlier is given. These jxitients may ])e fed in various ways. 
The food may be given from a spoon, or, what is usually pre- 
ferred, from a drin king-cup witli a s])out, or })y using a l)ent 
tube and allowing the patient to take the food from a glass. 
When the })atient is taking ])r('ad and similar solids, great care 
should be exercised not to allow the crumbs to fall into iha bed. 

In most severe illnesses it is necessary to awaken the patient 
during the night to administer food. This is a point that 
requires special judgment. Often the ])atient is more in need 
of sleep than of ibod. I'i the ])atient does not drop off to 



FEEDING UNCONSCIOUS AND REFRACTORY PATIENTS 3(;9 

sleep very soon after taking I'ood, it may he better to wait until 
he awakens before giving it. As a rnle, however, in severer ill- 
ness the sleep is distnrbed for bnt a few niiiuites bv taking ibod. 
A eup of warm milk or similar light Ibod may ollen induce 
sleep. 

The patient's mouth should always be ke|)t clean, li' dry 
and parched, it should be rinsed Ix'tbre and after taking WnA. 
A suitable mouth-wash is given under the heading of 1'ubercu- 
losis (p. 414), but any of the alkaline mouth-waslies may be 
useil ; boric acid and water also make an eilicient wasli. If the 
mouth is dry, it should be moistened from time to time, and for 
this purpose a little glycerin, water, and lemon-juice will be 
found useful. If the patient is helpless, the mouth may be 
swabbed out with cotton fastened to the end oi' a stout probe or 
wound about the finger. This should be moistened with some 
antiseptic solution. 

In all cases where the illness is likely to l)e ])rotracted, 
arrangements should be made to care for and pre])are the food 
with as little discomfort to the household as ptxssible. i^'or tliis 
purpose a diet kitchen may be improvised, preferal)ly in a room 
adjoining the patient's. If the patient's means allow, a small 
sick-room refrigerator should be provided, and a tin receptacle 
for storing foods that do not need to be ke})t on ice. A gas or 
alcohol lamp will serve for heating food. A thermometer, a 
graduate, a funnel, and filter-papers are needed, and a meat- 
mincing machine will be found a useful addition. Saucepans, a 
dish-pan, and a supply of tea tow^els should also })e ])rovided. 
Boric acid or borax and sodium bicarbonate will help to keep 
things fresh and clean. In cases of infectious and comnumi- 
cable diseases a covered boiler for disinfecting all dishes and 
utensils should be added. The dishes shotild be boiled in water 
to which 2 or 3 ])er cent, of sodium bicarbonate has been addcnl, 
and the boiling should be allowed to continue^ for fully twenty 
mintites after the water has bep:un to boil. Wliere instructions 
are likely to be carelessly followed out, it is best to direct that 
the dishes be boiled for an hour. 

Feeding: Unconscious and Refractory Patients. — 
Unconscious patients may often easily be fed by means of a 
teaspoon. Each spoonful should be swallowed before a second 
is given. W. Oilman Thompson advises that, in the case of 
comatose children, tlie nourishment be poured into the nostril 
instead of into the mouth. The fluid thus given is swallowed, 
and any excess returned by the other nostril. If any difficulty 

24 



370 DIET IN DISEASE. 

is experienced in swallowing, it is best to resort to either the 
stomach or the nasal tube. With a little practice most patients 
can be fed with the tube more easily than in any other way. 
A mouth-gag should be introduced or a roller bandage may be 
placed between the teeth and held in place by an assistant. In 
infants who have no teeth this precaution is unnecessary, as the 
finger answers the purpose perfectly. The tube, previously 
moistened, is passed into the pharynx and rapidly into the 
stomach. If the tube is not passed rapidly through the pharynx, 
contraction may follow and the tube be prevented from enter- 
ing the esophagus. In order to pass the tube into the esoph- 
agus it is necessary to hold it sufficiently well back from the end. 

If nasal feeding is to be used, a nasal tube, or in case of 
infants a catheter, is well oiled and gently passed through the 
nose into the esophagus and then into the stomach. Care 
should be taken not to pass the tube into the larynx. This 
accident can always be avoided by waiting a moment before 
pouring in the food. Either stomach or nasal tube should be 
provided with a funnel, and as soon as the tube has been satis- 
factorily introduced, the nourishment — milk, milk and Qgg, or 
whatever liquid food is desired — may be poured slowly into it. 

In order to prevent air from entering in advance of the food 
a small quantity of the food may be poured down the side of 
the funnel until the tube is full. In many cases it may be 
desirable to wash out the stomach before introducing the food. 
The tube should be withdrawn rapidly, so as not to excite 
vomiting. Food so introduced may be retained when it would 
otherwise be vomited. This is true both of infants and adults. 
(See the sections on Gavage, Forced Feeding in Tuberculosis, 
and Lavage.) 

In the case of refractory patients — the insane, the hysteric, 
and others who refuse to eat — forced feeding becomes neces- 
sary. In this case enough attendants should be prasent to con- 
trol the patient. He should be held firmly and the nasal or 
the stomach-tube be introduced. In order to prevent regurgi- 
tation of the food, which some patients manage to do quite 
skilfully while It is being introduced, the ril)s may be tickled. 
This prevents fixation of the (lia])hragm, without wliich the 
food can nf)t be ejcct^'d. This should be done oidy when occa- 
sion demands. (See Diet for the Insane.)

FEEDING IN FEVER. 

Before directing attention to the diet in special forms of 
pyrexia it will be well to consider briefly the ^en<'ral di(;tetie 
principles involved and their application to tliis class of dis- 
eases. 

There existed, in former years, many dill'crent views con- 
cerning the correct method of feeding fever cases. Prior to 
the time of Graves (1848) it was the general practice to 
'^ starve ^' fevers. Graves tiiught that a fever patient recpii red 
food and should be fed, and in his lectures, j)ul)lished in IS IS, 
there appeared the much-quoted sentenc^e : " If you should Ix; 
in doubt as to an epitaph to be placed upon my grave, take 
this — 'He fed fevers.' '^ With the teiiching of Murchison and 
others this view gradually replaced the older one, and to-day the 
profession are in accord regarding the diet indicated in febrile 
diseases. Minor differences in opinion exist and vai-ious theo- 
ries have been promulgated, but the practical ;ip})lication is the 
same in all cases. 

In fever the metabolic processes are increased, while at the 
same time the power of assimilation is lowered. This results 
in the burning-up of the body proteins ns wvW as of the fats. 
Indeed, it is stated that the proteins suffer a greater loss pro- 
portionately than the fats. The appetite is diminished or 
entirely lost, there is a marked lessened activity in all the 
glands concerned in digestion, and, as previously noted, absorp- 
tion and the assimilation of food are much below the normal. 
Thirst also is much augmented. 

Foods appropriate for healthy individuals are not, as a 
rule, suited for fever patients, and solid foods usually cause 
vomiting or severe indigestion. In order properly to noui-ish 
a fever patient it is necessary that the food be easy to take, 
easy to digest, and easy to assimilate. Any food that does not 
possess these three qualities is not suitable for a fever j-atient. 
When the disease runs its course ra])idly, the di(^t is of no great 
importance, for even if the patient take but little food, the 
period of comparative fasting is a brief on(> and any loss is 
easily made up while recovery is in progress. In ])rotracted 
diseases, on the other hand, such as ty])hoid fever, and in chronic 
fevers, the diet is of ])rimary importance and should })e the 
physician's first care. In chronic diseases and in those fevers 
where remissions occur, the periods when digestion is compara- 



372 DIET IN DISEASE. 

tlvely good should be taken advantage of, and the patient nour- 
ished and strengthened as much as possible. 

In fevers the mouth requires especial care (see Typhoid Fever 
and Tuberculosis) ; the bowels likewise should be regulated, and 
constipation avoided. 

In health the amount of food is largely regulated by the 
supply and kind available and the appetite. In disease the 
appetite as a guide is apt to be misleading, and either too little 
or too much food be taken. One must, therefore, be familiar 
with the food requirements of fever patients. For the average 
man, weighing 70 kilos or 150 pounds, 33 calories per kilo of 
body-weight are required, and, consequently, a total of 2300 
calories per day. These figures are based on the food require- 
ments of a liealthy man at rest. At present we do not know 
what the requirements of a fever patient are, but it a})pears 
that the processes of metabolism are increased, and an increase 
of about 2.") per cent, should be made to cover this. Approxi- 
mately, 40 calories per kilo may be taken as a standard, and a 
total of some 3000 calories for the individual of average size 
(150 pounds). If the patient takes less, it will be made up by 
the destruction of his body fat and protein, with a consequent 
loss in weight. It must be borne in mind that the small indi- 
viduals re(piire less and the large ones more, but the very obese 
may be regarded as not requiring the full amount for their 
actual weight, as much of their weiglit is made up of fat, and 
this probably does not require the same amount of nourishment 
as the cells of the body actively concerned with metabolism. 
Small persons and younger individuals in the growing stages 
require more food, and the aged less. For the young the re- 
quirements will be found under the heading of ^^Age.'' Not 
only must the total quantity of food required be considered, but 
the amount of protein and other food elements must be taken 
into account. In adults the amount of protein required daily 
is more or less fixed, but the amount of carbohydrate and fats 
will vary with the amount of })odily work performed. If ex- 
cesses of protein are given, it involves undue wear and tear in 
katobilizing and eliminating tliat above the body's needs. 
Under ordinary circumstances 16 grams of nitrogen daily are 
required, being the practical equivalent of the 118 grams of 
protein needed as stated by Voit. Chittenden has shown that 
even under hard lal)or a nitrogen equilibrium may be estab- 
lished at even less than half that amount and the individual 
continue in perfect health. l*rotein is needed in the body to 



FEEDING IN FEVER. 373 

repair the wear and tear, and in the youii^ i'or ^rowtli. It may 
also he used for furnishing; licahh and cncrov, hut, owini; to 
wh;it is known as tiie speeific^ dynaunc action of protein, perhaps 
not over ahout 14 })er eent. of the total ener^'^y should l)e suj)- 
plied as protein. The reason for this is tiiat in nH'tal)olizin<; 
fat and carbohydrates tlie amount oi' heat prochiccd is sliirht 
and may be disregarded, but ])rotein pnuhices some ;)() percent, 
of its caloric value in what miglit be called " waste h(>at," as it 
is not used in the functions of the body. It is foi- this reason 
that heat and energy are not derived to advantage from giving 
large amounts of protein, and it explains wliy the amount of 
protein food is limited in hot climates, in liot weather, and in 
fever. Various anthorities place the amount oi' protein needed 
by the fever patient of average size as between (Jo and 100 
grams a day. The balance of the number of calories needed 
may be made up of carbohydrates and fats, which it should be 
remembered are burned up in the body completelv, and are 
excreted as carbon dioxid and water, or, if not com])letelv 
oxidized, are stored in the body as fats. The form in which food 
is to be supplied to fever patients to meet the requirements is a 
question worthy of careful study. 

Milk is almost universally used as a fever diet. It fur- 
nishes 35 grams protein to the liter (roughly spe;d<ing, to tlie 
quart) and about 700 calories (640 to the (piart). To get the 
total food requirements from milk alone, over a gallon a dav 
would have to be used. It is better, therefore, to supplv part 
of the nourishment l)y using some other food. Milk mav, as 
a rule, be used up to 1^ to 2 quarts a day, supplying some 
1200 to 1300 calories per day. But few individuals can 
digest more than this for any length of time, and ev(Mi this 
amount may not be well borne unless it be modified in some 
way. Suggestions for modifying milk f)r adults may be 
learned by considering the methods used in infant feeding. 
The methods in most common use in invalid i'eeding arc^ to 
dilute the milk by adding water, carbonated water, \^ichy, lime- 
water, or a cereal gruel, such as barley or rice gruel. Sodium 
citrate may sometimes be added, especially if the curd gives 
rise to difficulties in digestion, or if milk causes constipation. 
From 1 to 5 grains to the ounce may be used. Partially 
pancreatized milk may be found of especial value, and butter- 
milk and whole milk, which has been inoculated with lactic 
acid bacilli, are both of service, particularly when there is any 
disturbance of the intestinal digestion. Koumiss, matzoon, and

kefir may also he used. Sometimes it is the taste of the milk 
which is ohjectionahle, and in such cases the milk may be 
flavored by the addition of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, or some of 
the numerous recipes given in tlie A])j)endix of this book mav 
be used. Plaited milk may often be used to advantage, and 
sometimes various invalids' and infants' foods may be of value. 

Cream is of great service, owing to its high caloric value, and 
it may be added to milk or be taken mixed with cereals. The 
remainder of the ])rotein may l)e supplied by using eggs, and 
from four to six may be regarded as a reasonal)le number to 
add to the diet. Y-^^^^ sometimes disagree, but this is more 
often due to faulty methods of preparation or to the use of 
cold-storage i^^J^^^i^ than to any real l'^\:!: idiosyncrasy. Eggs may 
be given in numerous ways — raw, \\ith orange- or lemon-juice, 
or with sherry or brandy, or merely with pepper and salt. 
Numerous {ig\^ and milk drinks can easily be improvised (see 
recipes for these and the pn^paration of other foods). If the 
patient can chew, there is no objection to the use of coddled, 
soft-boiled or poached Qgg^, or a })roperly prepared omelet. 

iNleats are ordinarily not to be used in fevers, although there 
are exceptions to this rule. They are objectionable chiefly 
because their use increases the ])rotein content of the food 
above that limit which has been ibund })y clinical experience 
to be best for fever ])atients, and the ])roducts of the metabo- 
lism of the extra amount of protein add to the work of the 
alreadv overburdened organism, as protein metabolism in the 
bodv is increased already beyond the normal in fever patients. 
Meat is objected to on account of the purin nitrogen contained, 
and the excretion of the end-products of these forms of nitro- 
gen entails greater work than a smaller amount of purin-free 
j)rot('in. The ])urin bodies are also su])p()sed to increase the 
temperature in fcvei- patients if present beyond a certain amount. 
Meat, too, is diilicuit of digestion uidess well chewed or freely 
divided, and many lever patients cannot ])ropei'ly masticate 
their fo(»d. If given at all, it .-liould be freely divided. ^leat- 
juices are sometim<s used, especially wlien little or no food is 
taken, l)Ut it has but a small caloric value. ]>ouillon and meat 
extra(;ts may be occasionally used, l)ut, as a rule, thev nre best 
avoided. The c()inmercial extracts contain large (piantitics of 
extractives which are undoirable ibr lever patients, and their 
food value is practically nothing. I'^nts arc to be used with 
caution, and chieflv as cream and butter :ind the yolk of an qo^^^.

treatment of withholding drinks i'rom ll'\cr p;iiiciiis, ,-uch a-

Thirst is caused by the increased tempcralui'c, the incrca.-cd 
metabolism, with its coincident incn^ase in \\a>!.'-product> to 
be excreted, and sometimes apparently by sodimu ch.Iorid re- 
tention. 

If sufficient fluid is not sup{)lied, the tongue becomes coated, 
the mouth dry, the })atient becomes more nei-\'on> ; if there i- 
delirium, it may be increased, or, if there is coma, it may be 
deepened. The urine and s\\eat are both dimini.-hed. Jl" Ihiid 
is sup})lied, the patient will pass increased (piantities o!" urine 
if in cool air, or there may be sweating, due either to the naiiire 
of the disease or to the heat. In some diseases thii-st t'ollow- 
great absti'action of water from collitpiative sweats or watery 
diarrheal discharges. In cholera and infantile diarrhea there 
are cases in which the blood actuidly becomes thick, owing tr> 
the great abstraction of water. One of the mo.-t important 
indications for treatment in ^uch conditions is supplying suffi- 
cient fluid by motith or generally by subcutaneous or intraven- 
ous infusion. Persistent vomiting may cause similar condi- 
tions, and in young infants fever may be induced by withhold- 
ing fluid, and promptly relieved by suj^piying it. 

If the patient is not getting sufficient fluid v.itli his food, 
and he generally is not, suitable beverages may be snp})lied at 
short intervals. Fhud should be given whether the ])ati(Mit is 
conscious or unconscious, as even conscious ])atient> may really 
be in mental states in which they will not ask for e\'en ui-gent 
necessities. From 1 to ^1 liters (ypiarts) a day may be I'euarded 
as an average allowance f )r an adidt with iever, I nrther 
details for giving fluids will be f )tmd under the heading of 
Ty})hoid Fever. 

As a gericral rule, the physician shoidd see that the })atient's 
bowels are moved at least once daily, and either drugs or an 
enema may be used, as may be deemed best. 



376 DIET IN DISEASE. 

Alcohol. — The question as to the vahie of alcohol in fevers 
is one that has been widely discussed. The safest view, prob- 
ably, is that which takes the middle ground, for while alcohol 
may have been, and still is, greatly abused in sickness, there 
can be no doubt that it renders great service, especially as 
a food and stimulant in fevers. Since alcohol is not needed 
in all cases, the growing tendency is to restrict its use to those 
cases in which it is definitely indicated. It should not be em- 
ployed as a routine measure in any disease, nor should it be 
used for any length of time where there is a likelihood of the 
patient acquiring the habit. In acute fevers in strong patients, 
where the disease is apt to be of short duration, it should not 
be used. If the odor is apparent on the breath of the patient, 
or if it causes excitement, delirium, or any mental symptoms, 
it should be used only in limited quantities. 

Alcohol, it should be remembered,, is not only a stimulant, 
but a food as well, each gram of it furnishing seven calories of 
heat or that equivalent of energy to the body. It should not be 
given too early in the disease lest its stimulating effect be lost 
as the system becomes accustomed to it. On the otlier hand, 
stimulation, cither by alcohol or any other stimulant, should not 
be delayed too long. As soon as the pulse becomes compressible 
and weak the stinuilant should be administered. When one is 
sufficiently expert in auscultation, the need for alcohol can be 
learned from the heart-beat. When the first sound becomes 
weak or loses its sharpness, it is a sign that the heart is begin- 
ning to flag. Sir Dyce Duckworth describes this as follows : 
^' The cardiac indications for tlie use of alcohol in fever arc a 
notable loss of tone in the first sound, es[)ecially if this be in- 
appreciable at the base (Stokes' sign), and the associated condi- 
tion of the pulse — that of k)w arterial pressure and the phase 
of it known as dicrotism." 

In hyperpyrexia alcoliol is of great value, for when the tem- 
perature runs very high digestion and assimilation are apt to 
come almost to a standstill. In these cases alcohol is easily ab- 
sorbed and acts as a stimulant and as a food. In continued hyjxT- 
pyrexia large amounts can l)e given, and it seems to be entirely 
used up in the body without ])n)ducing any mental symptoms. 

In the so-called asthenic fevers alcohol in small amounts and 
at quite frequent intervals is useful. In the very feeble and in 
the aged it may generally be taken with great benefit. 

In prolonged fevers in children attended with difficulty in 
feeding alcohol is also of value. In these cases the heart indi- 



THE FEEDING IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 377 

cations arc usually well marked and arc reliable (guides to tlie 
dosage. In givino- alcohol to children it should he well diluted, 
and small fre(juent rather than. lara:(! doses at longer intervals 
should be administered. r^arirc doses arc rarelv nc.'cded. 

In those habituated to the daily use oi" alcohol it nni>t be 
given in some form when these persons become ill with fever or, 
indeed, when confined to bed i'rom any cause. When alcohol 
is withdrawn suddenly from those accustomed to larL^e dailv 
amounts nutrition rapidly fails and delirium not irdVe(jueully 
sets in. 

It should be remembered that many conditions in which 
alcohol was thought to be indispensable a lew years ago are 
treated just as satisfactorily now without it. 

The form in which alcohol is to be given lever ])atients 
depends on individual taste. As a rule, ])ure whisk\' oi- Ijrandv 
diluted with plain or with a mineral water is ])rcferable. It' 
there is a decided preference for wines, a pure old wine, either 
light or red, may be pi'escribed. 

The quantity to be given depends upon circumstances, and 
the agCj condition, habits, and tolerance of the patient all play 
an important part in deciding this question, in infants and 
young children from -| ounce to 2 ounces of whisky divided 
over twenty-four hours may be regarded as a reasonable limit. 
In older children from 1 to 4 ounces in twenty-four hours, and 
in adults from 4 to 8 ounces in the same length of time, ibrm 
a good average. In the case of habitues and also when <»tlier 
circumstances, too numerous to mention here, warrant, these 
amounts may be increased. 

THE FEEDING IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 

DIET IN TYPHOID FEVER. 

The ]~)receding remarks on feeding fever j)atients in gcMieral 
should be carefully read before attempting to master the diet ior 
typhoid-fever ])atients. It should be borne in mind that it"(»ne 
understands the diet in typhoid fever they are prepared \n look 
after the feeding of almost any of the i'ebrile disease^. It 
should be remembered that the management of the diet i!i 
typhoid fever is one of the most im])ortant factors in the treat- 
ment of the disease. The problem that confronts the ]>hy>ician 
is the feeding of a patient who is to be ill ior weeks, who has a 
diseased intestine, and whose entire being is deranged by his 



378 DIET IN DISEASE. 

malady. Owing to the fever and toxemia there is a diminution 
in the quantity and the quality of the digestive juices. The 
muscular action of tlie alimentary tract is often diminished, the 
liver is more or less disturbed, and the bile less active than 
normally, and absorption is defective. 

It should be borne in mind that the mild case of typhoid 
needs Just as careful watching as the severer one, as there is 
the same tendency to ulceration and hemorrhage. Indeed, it 
might almost be said that such conq)lications are as great in 
what were at first mild cases, owing to the carelessness with 
which they are dieted. 

The aim should be to supply a sufficient amount of food to 
prevent wasting, and the figures given in the above considera- 
tion may be taken as a guide. The form in which the food is 
supplied will depend somewhat upon the patient, his surround- 
ings, and the ability to supj^ly fjods ; but in a general way this 
offers but little difficulty. At times the ingenuity of doctor 
and nurse will be called upon. The food should be adapted to 
the patient's digestive powers and, if he is not apathetic, as far 
as ])ossil)le, to his tastes. While the old days of starvation 
have fortunately passed away, we are now swinging to the other 
extreme, and care should be taken not to overfeed the patient 
in the endeavor to meet his real or su])posed caloric needs. 
Minor digestive difficulties should be watclied for and, if pos- 
sible, corrected. Any food which causes tympany should be 
avoided, as the di.^tention of the intestines with gas is one of 
the great factors in causing hemorrhage. The ulcers may be 
put on a stretch and the weakened walls of the swollen vessels 
may be ruptured, and, what is most serious, only partially rup- 
tured, so tliat the vessel is deprived of the normal power to 
('ontrol and sto}) the bleeding. It maybe made a rule that any 
food which produces gas should l)e avoided ; but remember that 
what causes gas in one ])atient may not in another, that this 
gas formation may be due to other factors than food, and that 
a food that at one time disagrees may later on again be of ser- 
vice. Thus, gas may be caused l)y the digestion being lessened 
thiY)ugh reflex action, as by a too long cold bath, or a visit from 
a too talkative friend, and in numerous ways, which nuist l)e 
carefully considered before eliminating a valuable food from the 
dietary. 

J low nuicli at a time and how often should food be adminis- 
tered is an important (piestion. The best way to answer this is 
to figure on the total (piantity of food, and then ascertain how 



THE FEKDiyO IN lyFhVTlOrS DISEASES lud 

much must be (^ivcu at a time tn ^c^t in tlie entire amount in 

tweuty-four liours. Thus, il' IS ounces are Liivcn, il" the t'ccd-

borne and only 6 or even .") feedings gixcn^the amount mu>l he 

larger — 8 ounces or 1) or 10 ounces being gi\-en at a time. 

Where the total is greater, the I'eedings nm,->t be l;n-gei\ W hen 

the food is taken with diliiculty and j)0()rly I'elained, feediuL^ at 

two-hour intervals may be used, and o- or 1-ouuce feedings 

given, or 5 or (3 ounces if the food has been diluted. This 

question of intervals and quantities nmst be studied for each 

individual patient, aud varied according to the n(>ces.-iiies ot" the 

case. It should be remembered that wiiere the food is diluted, 

either on account of the digestion of the {)atient or w itli the 

idea of tlie ])atient\s taking more water with the tbod, as when 

it is thought desirable to disttu^b him a> little as po.-sible, the 

quantity given may, as a rule, be greater than it would with the 

more concentrated foods. When the jKitient takes his U^nd 

poorly and is apathetic, drowsy, or comatose, the night and day 

interval may be made the same. If the patient takes his food 

fairly well and sleeps poorly, or has dlihculty in getting to sKep 

if disturbed, then the day intervals may be shortened and the 

night intervals lengthened. 

The question of supplying fluid is an important one. ^Fany 

patients suffer for ^yaut of water, and cannot or do not express 

their desire for it. If the tongue is dry and crusted and the 

mouth and lips covered with sordes, tlu^ patient need- more care 

and more water, and especially water and acid. (Joing to the 

extreme. Gushing and Clarke have sugsi(\<ted as much a^ a 

gallon or more water in twenty-four hours, giving it in small 

definite quantities at short intervals. Copious elimination oi" 

urine follows, corresponding to the amount of water ingested. 

They claim that the patient is more comfortable and that he is 

less toxic, and that the nervous symptoms are less wIumi large 

quantities of water are given. This may be partly due to the 

elimination of the sodium chlorid, which may be retained in 

larger quantities than normal in typhoid. Such reti^ntion is not 

apt to be the case in a milk diet, and the objection otVered that 

so much fluid eliminates too many of the body salts is worthy 

of consideration. The work of pumping the increasiHl amount 

of fluid is another point to be considered, (\-pecially in patients

with weak hearts. This question is one for further study. Three 
or four pints of water a day, in addition to that taken with the 
food, may ordinarily be regarded as a fair allowance. 

Plain water is usually the best, but there may be reasons for 
changing the drink of the patient. Some patients tire of plain 
water and like a change ; sometimes stimulants, foods, or acids 
may be thought desirable. Carbonated waters may be given if 
desired. The natural ones are to be preferred to those artifici- 
ally cliarged, and the excessive amounts of gas may })e allowed 
to escape by effervescence before they are given. Sometimes 
when the stomach is irritable the carbonated waters act as a 
sedative. The commonest need is for an acid, and water acidu- 
lated with diluted phosphate or by hydrochloric acid is of great 
service. AVhen there is diarrhea, small doses of aromatic sul- 
phuric acid may be given in this way to great advantage. Weak 
tea, with or without the addition of a little red wine, is a great 
thirst quencher, but acts somewhat as an astringent. Fruit- 
juice and water are })leasant when there is no intestinal dis- 
turbance, and are also of value if there is constipation. Lemon- 
ade, orangeade, grapefruit jnice and water, grape juice, rasp- 
berry juice, raspberry vinegar, all diluted with water, are most 
commonly used. These may be utilized as vehicles for admin- 
istering sugar where desired. Alcoholic beverages may be given 
if thought desira])le. Red or white wines with water, or even 
sherry or brandy and water, may be relished by some patients. 
French or Italian vermouth, well diluted with a carbonated water, 
is often taken to advantage. Under ordinary circumstances old 
whisky, properly diluted, may be the best alcoholic di'ink ; in 
some patients it exerts a slight laxative effect ; brandy is useful 
if there is diarrhea, and gin may occasionally be given for its 
diuretic effect. It may be made into a pleasant drink with lime 
or lemon juice and a carVjonated water. 

Coffee is an excellent cardiac stimulant and diuretic, and may 
be of great sf^rvice. It does not always agree, and it some- 
times causes great wakefulness ; but the previous ex])erience of 
the })atient witli coffee is usually a good guide. Of the com- 
binations of food and drinks — aside from milk — there are a 
great many, among whicli nuiy be nientioned albumin-water, 
barley-, rice- and oatmeal-water, arrow-root-water, toast-water, 
gum-arabic-water, and the like. 

How much food does the patient with ty])hoid need is a 
(juestion still under discussion. The recpiirenients generally 
agreed upon consist of some 40 calories per kilogram of body- 



THE FEEDING IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES. ^Sl 

weight, or about 3000 calorics a day foi- a j):iti('nt wciirliini:: h")!) 
pounds. Shatler and CoK'nian found that on a mixed diet 
a nitrogen equilibrium could not be estabn-hcii on tin- amount. 
When the amounts were increased to ()<) to SO calorie- per 
kilogram of body-weight, or a total of Kmio to :>.")( lO calories, 
the nitrogen ecjuilibrium was established. There wei-e, how- 
ever, wide variations at ditferent time<, even in the -ame indi- 
viduals. On the other hand, (jrafe, .-tudyiu!^ the metabolism 
in typhoid patients who were fasting, only once reached 40 
calories per kilo. Further studies will be nece-.-aiy to explain 
these various points, and in the meantime the food amount- 
that are best for ty})hoid patients will hav<' to be determined 
clinically. The truth will be foiuul in the fact that Ibod re- 
quirements vary with the individual and the character of the 
disease. Nothing will replace the study of the individual ca.-e. 
In former days there can be no question that lever patients, and 
especially typhoid patients, were starved, but it i> ju.-t a- im- 
portant not to overfeed. The individual re(piirement- of a 
patient — especially in private practice — is a vague thing to 
many physicians, and a word or two may not be out o!" place. 
The general appearance means much. W the patient looks 
more or less well, it is a favorable sign. If \w is anxious or 
irritable, it may be on account of too little or too much food, 
or due to gastric or intestinal distress, or, of cour.-e, it may be 
due to many other conditions. Ex})erience or judgment ai'e 
needed to decide what is wrong. The weight of the patient is 
the best guide to the state of his nutrition. In many hospital- 
appliances are to be found for weighing |)atients in bed, and 
where these are not at hand the eye nnist be trained to >ee and 
the hand to feel the condition of the tissues, and one soon 
learns to appreciate whether the patient is gaining or losing. 
If he is losing, it is a good general rule to try and give more 
food, if there be no contraindications to this, and there gener- 
ally are not. The appetite is important, and if the patient is 
hungry, it is a good ])lan to try to give sulficient ibod to make 
the patient comfortable. If the mouth is coated and dry, fluid 
and acids should be given. If the tongue and mucous mem- 
branes are bright red or scarlet, alkalis, such as \^ichy, should 
be administered. This is rarelv the case in typhoid. \^ the 
patient is toxic, more fluid should be tried, and this may al.-o 
be tried in restless and irritable patients. 

The ratio of protein, fat, and carbohydi'ate on which the 
patient does best cannot be definitely stated at this time, and 



382 DIET IN DISEASE. 

doubtless varies both in the patient and the stage and the 
character of the disease. From 60 to 95 gm. of protein a 
day have given the best results in cases in which metabolism 
studies have been made. Purin nitrogen seems to be more apt 
to raise the temperature, hence foods containing purin nitrogen 
should be sparingly used during the febrile period. These foods 
are discussed under the head of Gout. The principal foods 
containing purin nitrogen are meats, fish, peas, beans, asparagus, 
onions, mushrooms, and oatmeal. A purin-free diet need not 
be considered here, but may be borne in mind. 

The possibility of feeding fats varies, but Coleman found 
tliat they were better borne when the temperature began making 
wide remissions and during convalescence. Cream and butter 
have been used in considerable quantities, and with apparent 
benefit. Carbohydrates have been found to be of es])ecial value 
in supplying the needs of typhoid patients, and it would seem 
that a very considerable amount of the daily food may consist 
of carbohydrates, es{)ecially so when high caloric diets are used. 

We now come to the choice of foods and the actual amounts 
that may usually be given. Milk has always been, and doubt- 
less will always continue to be, a favorite f )od in typhoid fever. 
This topic has often been the subject of debates. Suffice it to 
say that practical experience demonstrates that milk mtiy be 
taken in large quantities, and generally to advantage. Bear in 
mind tliat a satisfiictory typhoid diet may easily be arranged 
without milk, should it be thought desirable to do so. Some 
patients cannot take milk without gastric or intestinal disturb- 
ance, but those })eople in whom actual milk idiosyncrasy exists 
are the exception. Milk generally agrees if properly modified. 
It may cause tympanites, it may cause diarrhea, and sometimes 
it may cause gastric indigestion. When any of these occur, it 
should be omitted from the diet for a day or two, and then 
started again, using some different modification. The methods 
of modifying milk in the diets for fevers have been fully 
discussed above. The quantities used in ty])hoid may be put 
down at from 1 i to 2 liters ((|uarts) in twenty-four hours. To 
this may be added 250 c.c. {I pint) of 20 per cent., or IG per 
cent, cream, should it be desired to increase tlie calories by 
using milk. Sometimes as nuicli as :> liters (quarts) of milk 
may \)v. used, but there are not many ])ati('nts who can digest 
that amount ibr anv length of time. Children are more apt to 
tak<' milk over long ])erio(ls of time without untoward eil'ccts 
than adults. We have used milk very largely at the Jtobert 



THE FEKDiyO IN LXFECTIors DISEASES. 383 

Garrett H()S])ital for Cliildreii, in lialtiincirc, .-iiul it aL:r('('s ad- 
mirably in most cases. l^'tir years we used ii almo.-t e:\clii>i\('lv, 
but in recent years ^ve have Ix-eii inclined to a iii<»i'c liberal 
dietary. Kerlev believes that the milk diet u^nl in children is 
lar<2:ely responsible for the comparatively hi^h moi-l:dit\-, but 
we cannot agree with him. liad results may be noted at times, 
but they are usually the result of im-kilful I'eediiii:', and not to 
the milk itself. liigh calorie diets are, as a rule, not well borne 
by the very yoimg. 

Kggs may be used in typhoid iever to advantap-. WC 
formerly taught that eggs were not well borne, but tin- -tale- 
ment appbes only to cold-storage egus. Only iresli egu^ -hould 
be used. Eggs may be given as all)innin-watei-, or the ^^•llole 
raw egg may be shaken up with milk, or with other articles of 
food, into palatable drinks. Coddled i"j:£!:>, sol't -boiled i'!j,<!:>, or 
poached eggs may also be used if the patient is suniciently well 
to masticate them. From four to six eggs may be given dailv. 
Meats are not suitable for typhoid patients. Tlwy contain too 
much nitrogen, and this in itself is liable to upset the metabo- 
lism. Meat is objectionable on account of its so-calle<l dynatnic 
action, and also because of the pnrin nitrogen which it coulains. 
Beef-juice may be given in exceptional cases, and bouillon (^r 
beef extracts may be used as a})]:>etizers, but they contain too 
little nutriment to be of any value. Diu'ing convalescence meats 
are of great value, and fat may be given as the yolk of egi:-, -ix 
yolks a day being the maxinuim average. Cream may be n>ed 
to advantage, and butter may also l)e given. Too high fat always 
causes trouble, and its use should be careiiilly watched. 

The carbohydrates allowable consist ol' the various >ugar>and 
starches. Of the sugars, cane-sugar and milk->ugar may be 
used to greater advantage than any of the others. Oane->ugar 
is so sweet that scarcely more than a tal>lespooni\il can he 
added to 6 or <S oimces of milk, lemonade, collee, and >imilar 
drinks. Milk-sugar is not so sweet, and is well borne, a- a 
rule. In children with diarrhea it should b(> u.-ed cautiou.-iy, 
if at all. Several tablespoonfids may be given at a time if 
desired. It should be given in lemonade (»r eolVee or in milk, 
as suggested below. Starches are best given as cerc^al gruels, 
toast, zwieback, and crackers. Starchy ibod- foi- typhoid pa- 
tients should contain little or no cellulo.-e, and slioidd be as I'ree 
from water as possible. Thev should always be well cooked 
and pre])ared, so as to be palatable and easy of digestion. 
Starches are bulkv foods at best. 



384 DIET IN DISEASE. 

Malted milk is a .valuable food in some cases, especially in 
difficult ones, and particularly so in children who take milk 
and other foods poorly. The proprietary foods, consisting of 
beef and alcohol, should not be used except now and then 
when everything seems to disagree or pall. 

Alcohol may be used according to the rules laid down for 
fevers in general. 

The following suggestions as to caloric values will be found 
of value in arranging dietaries. The figures are approximate : 

Milk, 1 liter (quart) GoO.O 

Milk, 30 gni. (1 ounce) 20.0 

Cream, 20 per cent., 500 c.c. (1 pint) 1000.0 

Whey, 30 gm. (1 ounce) 10.0 

Buttermilk, 30 gm. (1 ounce) 10.0 

Condensed milk, 30 gm. (1 ounce) 132.0 

Whole e^g 80.0 

White of egg 30.0 

Yolk of egg 50.0 

Cane-sugar, 30 gm. (1 ounce) 116.0 

Milk-sugar, 30 gm. (1 ounce by weight) 116.0 

^lilk-sugar, 30 gm. (1 ounce by volume) 72.0 

Milk-sugar, 9 gm. (1 tablespoonful) 36.0 

Barley tlour, 30 gm. (1 ounce by weight) 100.0 

Rice flour, 30 gm. (1 ounce by weight) 100.0 

Boiled rice, 1 tablespoonful 60.0 

Toast, average slice 80.0 

Toast, thick slice 100.0 

Bread, average slice 80.0 

Bread, thick slice 100.0 

Crackers, 1 ounce ••'.... 114.0 

Apple-sauce, 30 gm. (1 ounce) 30.0 

Further suggestions will be found in Roberts' tables of the 
caloric value of household measures of foods (p. 78), and in the 
talkie of caloric values of common foods per ounce (p. 79). 

Irving Fisher has suggested that the labor of computing diets 
can be much simplified l)y serving foods in standard portions 
of 100 calories each, and his table, showing the amounts, 
together with the number of calories furnished by protein, fats, 
and carbohydrates, will be found on p. 70. 

In making up the dietary for the typhoid patient the follow- 
ing foods sliould l)e borne in mind, while additional ones will 
suggest themselves by looking over the recipes at the end of 
the book : 

Milk. Koimiisss. 

Cream. Cocoa. 

I>uttermilk. Chocolate. 

AMiey. Ice cream.

small amounts. 

Oatmeal is ordinarily not suited as a food for tvphoid fever 
])atients, but sometimes is u,<ed. It shoidd be cooked live hours 
and strained. 

Pea-soup and bean-soup have been suggested, but ordinarily 
are objectionable on two grounds — the piu-in nitrogen contained 
and their great tendency to cause flatulence in some patients. 

Baked or mashed potatoes may be used sparingly. 

Iligli Cdloric Diet. — Sliattuck, of Boston, has long advocated 
more liberal feeding in ty])hoid })atients, and Coleman and 
Shaffer have experimented with it extensively. The following 
is largely taken from Coleman's article in the Amcricdn .Joui-iuil 
of the Medicdl Sciences for January, ]U\'2 : \\v havt^ gone into 
the subj(>ct in considerable detail, as it shows what can be done 
practically in high caloric feeding, and a carcfid study of the 
method teaches many lessons in fever feeding. If the patient 
is sufficiently well to take notice, he etui be told that the more 
he eats the better, and that he may ask f)r articles of diet 
wdiich may be allowed if they are suitable. 11h> large quan- 
tities of milk-sugar sugi>;(\<ted are oi'tvu well taken in one f )od 
and objected to in another. During the iirst few days of ob- 
servation milk may be used and then the diet gradually in- 
creased. During the early stage oOOO calories may be about 
all the patient will take; later, the amoinit may be increa.^ed to

siniilation of the food, the amount should he decreased at oiice. 
Any form of food that disagrees should be discontinued, lest the

tions can be avoided. If tlie month is in good condition, the 
patient can, as a rnlc, take his food easily ; if it is not, tlie 
greatest difficulty nuiy be experienced. After each feeding the 
mouth should be clean,«^ed carefidly, a ])roceeding that should 
never be neglected. If the j)atient is strong enough, he may 
rinse the moutii with a mild antiseptic solution — tiie prescrij)- 
tion given in the section on Tuberculosis is an admirable one. 
Boric acid solutions to which a little glycerin and lemon-juice 
have l)een added or one of the pi'cpared mouth-washes diluted 
with water may be used ; diluted hydrogen peroxid is also 
servi(;eable. Jf the ])atient is too weak to do this, the nurse 
should swab the moutii. Tlie physician siiould assure him.^elf 
that the nurse is carrying out his orders in this regard, for 
careless nurses are often apt to neglect this.

Diet in Digestive Disturbances.— In cases whore tlio 
lood is rejected or l)a(lly home it is necessai'v to <^ive the 
stomach ahsohite rest lor several hoiii's oi- more. Then verv 
small quantities of eg^-- water, l)arley-water and lemon-juice, or 
similar preparations, may he given. Pano))ej)ton and tl'ie liijuid 
heef ])reparations are useful in this condition, and n)a\- i)e served 
Avith cracked ice or diluted with water. \\ Cak tea or i-ed wine 
and water in small doses are useful, esjx'cially ii" thei-e i> diarrhea. 

Diarrhea is often caused })y the use of milk in which there 
are large numbers of bacteria. Where diarrhea per>i>ts, the 
milk used should be examined and sterilized or pasteurized milk 
used. The effect of using pasteurized milk in such ca.-es is 
often very striking, as has been shown by Ivlsall. 

For the diarrhea an ice-bag to the abdomen has been highly 
recommended, but is seldom well borne. Instead, cloths 
moistened with cold water may be use<l. 

For the ])ainful and troublesome accunndation of gas in the 
intestine either the ice-bag or the cold applications may ])i'ove 
beneficial. The authors have obtained excellent results from 
the use of turpentine stupes, but these have failed in the han<ls 
of many physicians. When the meteorism is due to the im))er- 
fect digestion of starch, the carbohydrates should be reduced 
or withdrawn ; when it is due to milk, the form in which this 
is given should be changed or it should be Avithdrawn altogether 
for a time. 

Hemorrhag'e. — When hemorrhage from the bowel occur.-, 
the intestinal tract should be given absolute rest for a number 
of hours. An ice-bag, cold applications, oi- a cold-water coil 
should be placed u])on the abdomen. To relieve the thii'st the 
patient may be allowed to suck small bits of ice, or ice-cold 
water or cold tea may be given in spoonful doses. Alter some 
hours the patient may be given a teas])oonful oi" cold milk, 
and this may be re])eated every tNvo or three hours. Beyond 
this, if the bleeding is severe, the intestinal tract should be 
given complete rest for twenty-four hours or longer. ()pium 
or morphin may also be used. The retui'u to the regular fevcM* 
diet should be made gradually and with caution. 

Perforation. — When perforation occurs, all iood should be 
discontinued and surgical treatment instituted, or where this is 
not possible, large doses of morphin or opium may be ])re- 
scribed. Following operation the diet will be that of any 
bowel perforation that has been operated u]>on. Jl' the ])atient 



392 DIET IN DISEASE. 

rallies without surgical intervention, or when this has been 
found impracticable, food may be given after an interval of 
twenty-four hours, but only in very small quantities at suffi- 
ciently wide intervals. It is best to begin with teaspoonful 
doses every three hours, and if the food is retained, this may 
gradually be increased. Usually food is rejected, and when 
tliis is the case, the stomach should be given complete rest, for 
feeding only tends to aggravate the condition. 

Convalescence. — The diet during the first weeks of con- 
valescence requires as much care and attention as it received 
throughout the febrile period ; in fact, since these patients often 
develop a ravenous appetite, born of several weeks' milk diet 
and fever, even greater care is necessary. The patient's wishes 
should in nowise govern his diet, and relatives and friends 
should be cautioned against giving the patient anything not 
ordered by the physician. ]\Iany a relapse and death has been 
caused by the misguided kindness of friends and relatives in 
this respect. 

When there has been severe bowel disturbance, the j)atient 
is to be kept on a liquid diet until the ninth or tenth day of 
the afebrile period. After mild cases, where there has been 
l)ut little l)owel disturbance, changes may be made in the diet 
after the fifth or sixth afebrile day. In these mild cases the 
greatest caution is required, as they are often quite as apt to 
do badly as are the severe ones, and the attendants are much 
more likely to be careless in carrying out instructions. 

The first addition to the dietary shoidd be made by giving a 
piece of zwieback over which hot milk or cream has been 
poured. If desired, milk-toast, milk and crackers, or junket 
may be substituted for this. If this is well borne, other arti- 
cles, such as soft-boiled eggs or the soft part of oysters if they 
are in season and can be obtained fresh, may be added from 
day to day. Thickened meat Ijroths containing well-boiled 
rice or vermicelli may be given. Finely scra})ed raw l)eef, 
reduced to a j)ulp in the manner suggested for tuberculosis 
])atients, also lends variety. 

Tender meats, vegetables, and bread-stuffs in increasing 
(juantities may be allowed. Itoast chicken, squab, or partridge, 
})oiled (white) fish, such as trout ; of the vegetables, spinach, 
caulifiower toj)s, asparagus-tips, purees of })eas, can-ots, or 
tender string-beans or artichokes, well-cooked rice, and b.aked 
potato mashed and served with cream or disli gravy ; toast,

zwieback, crackers, and tlie crust oi' hrcad may all he ])ov- 
niitted. If the condition of tlic bowel jK'rinils, fi'iiil-jiiiccs may 
be allowed, as ^vell as a baked apple, apple->au(*e, or junket 
flavored with fruit. Other sick-room delicacies may be oi'dei'cd 
at the discretion of the physician. ( 'hops, tender steak, and roast 
beef may generidly be uiven in the third afebrile week (verv 
finely divided meat may l)e allowed mucli earlier), and the diet 
i!:raduallv changed until the ordinary diet is resumed, 1^'or 
some time after an attack of typhoid the patient >lionld be 
instructed to exercise care in the selection of his diet, and 
es])ecially to avoid all food such as gvvvn fruit, t:;reen corn, 
crabs, and the like, that is likely to cause diarrhea. 

The following menu for tlie first week of convalescence may 
serve as a guide to the inexperienced ])livsician, and mav be 
altered to suit the individual case. It may be begun about the 
fifth or sixth afebrile day in mild cases, and aboiU the ninth 
or tenth in severe cases. Milk should form the bulk of the 
diet at this period. 

First Day. — Milk-toast or zwieback covered with hot milk 
or cream or crackers and milk. Beef-juice. 

Second Dai/. — Chicken broth thickened with rice or vermi- 
celli. (The rice should be boiled thoroughly.) Soft parts of 
several oysters, or a very lightly boiled egiz-. 

Third Day. — Junket, a meat broth thickened with well- 
cooked barley (boiled at least three hours), with barky Hour, or 
with stale bread-crumbs. Wine-jelly. Scra|)ed raw bec^f 

Fourth Day. — Tjightly boiled or ])oached egg. Arrow-root, 
barley gruel, or milk-toast. Chicken-jelly. 

Fifth Day. — Junket, a little well-boiled rice with a small 
amount of finely divided roast chicken, s(juab, or partridge, 
preferably the white meat. A})ple-saiice if bowels permit. 

Sixtli day. — Scraped beef, })oached (}^^<j:, calve>'-tbot jelly. A 
baked custard. A piece of toast or zwieback. 

Seventh Day. — A small piece of finely divided broiled cho}) 
or steak, baked potato. A baked a])ple. \Vell-boiled rice and 
cream for breakfast. Junket for su])i)er. 

ATYPICAL TYPHOID.-COMPLICATED TYPHOID. 

There are two classes of cases in which especial attention to 
the diet is required. These are : {a) atypical typhoid, cases 
where the fever persists for weeks as prat'tically the oidy symp- 
tom ; and (6) those cases that have run their coiu'se, but where. 



394 DIET ly DISEASE. 

owing to some com])lieation, most frequently the presence of 
pus, the fever remains high. 

The first class are often associated with extreme emaciation, 
and the fever may be regarded as a true inanition fever. In 
others the emaciation may not be extreme, but the fever mav 
persist, and may not disappear until the ])atient is allowed to sit 
up. In these cases, after sufficient time has elapsed for healing 
of the intestinal ulcerations to take i)lace, and if there are no 
other symptoms forbidding it, the diet may be increased in the 
same way as during an ordinary convalescence. If an exacer- 
bation of the symptoms occurs and the fever increases, it is an 
indication that too much food is being given. 

In the second class of cases there may be extreme emaciation, 
with the development of abscesses or furuncles. These patients 
may be benefited by an increase in the diet, for some of them 
do not seem to be al)le to assimilate sufficient nourishment from 
the food-sn])ply to make u]) for the waste. 

In any case where there is fever the diet should be watched 
carefully and no changes be made unadvisedly. 

TYPHUS FEVER, 

The diet in this disease is the same as in all acute fevers ; 
typhus requires no especial precautions, such as are needed in 
typhoid. During the acute stage of the disease the diet should 
hi' liquid, milk being best. When this is not well borne, liquid 
substitutes, such as are usod in ty])l!oid, mny l)e given. The 
food should be administered at regular and sufficiently frequent 
intervals — every two, three, or f)ur hours, according to the 
quantity the ])atient is able to take at one time. A cjuart of 
milk and a ])int of animal broth may be considered a fair 
amount of f )od lor one day. Water should be given freely. 

Curschmann calls attention to the fact that eggs are better 
borne in ty|)husthan in typhoid, and reconnncnds that several l)e 
given every day. He also advises the use of solid Ibod, even 
(hiring the? ])eriod of fever, if the patient is able to masticate and 
swallow. Jle allows rolls, ZNvieback, ehieken, and chopped meat. 

As a rule, the patients rcfpiire a >iip|)ortiMg and a stinudating 
diet from the outset. Alcohol may be gi\'eii when tlie pulse and 
the general eondition demand its use. JMaek eollee, especially 
when there is a tendency to stupor, is also to be recommended. 

Com])lications are treated in the same way as when they 
occur in tyj)hoid. During convalescence the diet should be in- 



77//'; FF.EDISC IS ISFFJTIors DISFASF.S. ."M).") 

creased as rapidly as possible, tlie usual care Ix-iuw- oli.-ci-ved 
(see the section on the Diet in l^'excrs). Alcohol in ^ouic Ini-m 
is generally necessary at (his time. The fni-ui iu which it i- 
to be given may be g()V('rned by the palicul'- ta-t<', and the 
amount should be earei'ully regulated by the j)atieul\- condition. 

SMALL-POX. 

The diet in small-])(»x is similar to that reeouimended in otlxf 
acute tevers. The only point to be noted e>j)eciallv is that the 
supporting diet should be begun early, as in the>e\-efe case- the 
extensive suppuration makes a large drain on the patient's s\-teiii. 

Diu'ing the hrst stage of the disease there i- little doire (br 
food. The diet shoidd be licpiid, and consi-l (•(' milk, broth.-, 
albumin-water, and the like. Intense tlilr>t is geneially j»re— 
ent, and this may be relieved by water, lemonade, or the car- 
bonated waters. 

AVhen the initial fever subsides and the p:itient leel- im]>i'n\-ed. 
it is well to allow any light nutritious ibod he may desire — milk, 
eggs, chops, steak, or rare roast meat ; bread or t(»a-t ; and the 
more easily digested vegetables, such as well-cooked |)otat«). 
S])inach, celery, asparagus-tips, caiditlower tops, and the like 
are all suitable. 

When the second period of fever comes on, a return to the 
liquid diet may again be made. The diet should be a- ampk- 
as possible, and the food be given at regular intervals eveiy two 
or three hours during the day and every thnM' or Ibur h<>ui> at 
night. Milk, ])lain or peptonized, milk-punch, I'aw eggs. cl:l: 
and shcrrv, and the various cond)inations and dishes made ••i" 
Qgo^^ and milk shoidd be given. Broths, beet-juiee, and the like 
may also be added (see Reeij)es in A])j)en(lix). When there i- 
marked dysphagia, as there is apt to be in all severe cases, the 
food is best given cold, at more fre<pi(Mit interval.-, and in smaller 
(Hiantities. Rectal feedino- niav be resorted to in some ca-e-. 

In severe cases alcohol is r(M[uired, and may be given 
from time to time as the condition of the [)atieiit demand-. 
AV^hisky, brandy, and port wine are, as a rule, borne be.-t ; the 
whisky or brandy shoidd l)e given in diluted form, coud)ine<! 
with a small amount of glycerin or syrup to a\oid irritating 
the throat. Stinuilants may be added to the milk, or \\\vy may 
he given in the form of milk-punch or egg-nog. according to 
the patient's taste. Alcohol should not be gi\-eu as a routine 



396 DIET IN DISEASE. 

practice in all cases, as was formerly done. Mild cases and 
even those of moderate severity, in patients under twenty, usu- 
ally require little or no stimulation. 

During the convalescence the diet may be increased rapidly. 
As soon as the fever declines, meat may be added to the dietary, 
and when the appetite and digestion allow, other articles of diet 
may be given. 

SCARLET FEVER. 

Some difference of opinion exists regarding the value of 
diet in preventing nephritis in scarlet fever. A careful study 
of these cases, however, has led to the belief that a strict milk 
diet during the height of the disease and a mixed milk and 
farinaceous diet during convalesence are by far the safest. 
Ziegler, reporting an experience of twenty-one years with 231 
cases kept on an exclusive milk-diet, did not have a single case 
of nephritis. Previous to that time, on a mixed diet, half his 
cases developed nephritis. After a nuin])er of years of favor- 
al)le experience with the use of milk diets in scarlet fever, 
we have come to the conclusioi^ that wliile the diet is effect- 
ive in ])reventing the late cases of nepln-itis, it is difficult to 
use in many cases. A\^e have recently l)€^en more liberal — 
allowing farinaceous foods and, in fact, almost any purin-free 
food. So far we have not had any untoward results. A list 
of the ])urin-free foods will be found under the heading of 
l^urin ]\Ietabolism. The milk slioukl be diluted with lime- 
water or with a carbonated water ; if it disagrees, it may be 
peptonized, either partially or completely. Koumiss or butter- 
milk, particularly the former, may be given as a change. Al- 
though they may refuse it at first, chiklren often learn to like 
koumiss. If milk becomes distasteful or disagrees, it may l)e 
mixed with barley-water or arrow-root gruel, or these may be 
given })lain. Oyster or clam broth, the oysters or clams having 
been strained out, makes a ])Ieasant change. 

For the thirst, which is generally great, plain or carbonated 
waters, barley-water, orangeade, or lemonade may be given 
freely. A level teaspoonful of creani of tartar stirred into a 
glass of lemonade is a useful diuretic drink if albuminuria is 
present. 

Plain vanilla ice-cream or a ])lain lemon ice may be given in 
small (juantities. I^'inely shaved ice, also in very small (juan- 
tities, and flavored with a little lemon- or orange-juice, often 
makes a most grateful addition if angina is marked. 



TlIK FKKDISa IX IXFhCTIOCS DISh'ASKS. IVJl 

Jaccoiid and Baginsky Insist that scarlatinal nophritis mav 
generally he averted if a milk diet is adlu^rcd to li.r >(v< ml 
weeks in all cases. It is a i^ood plan to let the diet in all ca-rs 
be as simple as ])()ssihle for three weeks, and then to make addi- 
tions to it from day to day. If there i> all)iniiiiiiiria or nephri- 
tis, a milk and fai'inaeeous diet, as reeomniended in nephi'iti-, 
shoukl be adhered to. If there has heen a >evei-e alhuniinnria, 
without casts, or if symptoms of nejdiritis have appeared, the 
diet should be licpild for a month oi- six week-, the iii-ine heiiiLT 
carefully watched in the meantime. Owini: to eai-ele-~n(-- in 
regard to the diet, mild eases of scarlatina may he li.lli.wed hv 
severe nephritis. 

In all cases the diet shoidd be gradually increased from dav 
to day during convalescence ; the following ma\- >erve a- a uuide 
to the order in which this increase may he made: .MIIk-tna~t, 
junket, custard, farina pudding, oranges, i'iee-pii<ldinu, haktd 
apple, bread and milk, sago or tapioca pudding, with or with- 
out apple, corn-starch pudding, boiled custard. 

The return to meat is best made by allowing a small (juantit\ «>t' 
boiled or baked fish, the soft })arts of oy-ters, \-erv .-Mfi-lx.jlcd 
eggs first and then the lightest and mo.^t easily digested nn at-, 
chicken, raw or very rare beef in minute (iiiantitie.-, and the like. 

During the height of the disease and throughout convales- 
cence meat-extracts should be avoided, a< thev contain lai'-*' 
quantities of meat extractives, which are liable to irritate the 
kidneys. 

Kest in bed shoidd be insisted upon until th(^ tcNcr has bcMii 
absent at least a week. In mild cases of scarlet fescr stimu- 
lants are not required ; but in the severe cases, whei-e there i< 
adenitis, marked angina, or sepsis, alcohol may be u-ed a< the 
heart and general condition indicate the n(>ed for it. (Scr 
Alcohol in Fevers.) Strychnin and digitalis are al.-o u-eful. 

MEASLES. 

In measles the diet is similar to that of any acute fe\-er. The 
food of infants, if bottle-fed, should be more dilute than u>ual ; 
for older children an exclusively li(|uid diet is in(licat(Ml. 

Milk, soups, and broths may be allowed, and tluse may be 
peptonized if necessary. The food should he given at regidar 
intervals, these depending on the amoimt given at each time — 
generally two, three, or four hours a])art. 

Thirst may be allayed by water, plain or carbonated, oiangc^ 



398 DIET IN DISEASE. 

ade, lemonade, and the like. The return to a solid diet should 
be made gradually. Alcohol may be used if necessary. When 
gastro-intestinal disturbances supervene, they should be treated 
in the customary way. (See Feeding in Fever.) 

MUMPS. 

While fever or swelling exists the diet should be liquid. 
During convalescence some solid food may be taken. Care 
should be observed to avoid all acids and astringents, as these 
may cause extreme discomfort and even intense pain. 

WHOOPING-COUGH. 

In all cases of whooping-cough the diet and the bowels 
require the closest attention. 

If the child has any tendency to tlie so-called '' mucous dis- 
ease " or to intestinal disturbance, this is almost sure to mani- 
fest itself during the course of the disease, as all the mucous 
membranes are apparently affected. Attacks of indigestion and 
the abdominal distention that usually follows may increase the 
number of j)aroxysms. There is always a tendency to vomit. 
This usually occurs with or after the ])aroxysms of coughing, 
but the pharynx may become so irritable that vomiting may 
be excited by the taking of food, drink, or medicine. Any 
drug that tends to produce nausea should carefully be avoided. 

The diet for children under two years of age should be fluid. 
Milk, diluted with lime-water or a carbonated water, or pep- 
tonized, should be tiie mainstay. Broths, albumin-water, and 
barley-water are also useful. In cliildren w^ho are weak or in 
whom vomiting is severe, some of the predigested liquid beef 
preparations, well diluted with water, may \)C given. Tliese 
are stimulating and contain considerable nutriment. 

Children over two yeai's of age, if the case is s(>vere, should 
be |)ut on a li(|ui(l diet. If food is retained and vomiting is 
not troublesome, semisoli<l food may be given ; if this causes 
n(^ disturbance, easily digested solid food may be allowed. 
Kumiss is sometimes of vahie, and custards, barley, oatmenl, 
or arrow-root gruels, l)i'oths, junket, and the like are useful in 
varying the diet. 

If nuich diilicnlty is expci-icnced in feeding the child, the 
food should be given in small (juantities every two or three 
liours. If vomiting y)ersists, the measures recommended in the 
section on Vomiting may be tried. li' a meal is vomite<l, it

cuit and wdne at noon ; meat bi-oth, roast meat, toast, an<l w ine 
in the afternoon; wine in the evening, and cold water at night. 
He allowed no milk, vegetables, soups, or pudding-. 

INFLUENZA. 

The diet in this disease should be that recommende<l in all 
acute febrile conditions. During the height of the di>ea-e the 
food should be liquid, and l)e given ir. small (piantitie- and at 
regidar intervals. As the condition improves a return to a 
semisolid diet and then to solid food maybe made. ( "oiiva- 
lescence is apt to be slow and tedious, and duiing this period 
easilv dio^ested nutritious f)od should be oiven in a- laruc 
quantities as the patient can digest. Milk and egus, either 
alone or combined in the form of egg or egii-nog. may be given 
between meals. Alcohol is usually indicated throughout the 
disease, and may be given in the foi-m of whi-ky an«l water, 
wine, or malted li(piors, according to the condition and ta-te 
of the patient. If convalescence is slow, a ehan<:'<' of air will 
often facilitate recovery and restore the a[)]K'lite and >treiigth. 

MENINGITIS AND CEREBROSPINAL FEVER. 

In these diseases the diet is that of all acute levers. The 
food may be liquid or semisolid, and should be given at rt^^-nlar 
intervals. If the ])atient is able to swallow, several ounces 
may be given at a time every two or three hour<. It' swallow- 
ing is difficult, small quantities of ])r(>digested f )od may be given 
at very short intervals — every half-hour, or if it is given only 
a teaspoonful at a time, as frequently as every tifteen minutes. 
In these cases the food may be given with a tea.-p(^on or a med- 



400 DIET ly DISEASE. 

icine-clropper. In some cases, wliere it does not excite convul- 
sions, a stomach- or nasal tube may l)e used. 

If tlie patient is able to swallow, liquids and semisolids are 
indicated. Water may be given freely, and as the patients are 
often unconscious or only semiconscious, water should be given 
as a routine. This is a matter that is frequently neglected. 

Alcohol may be used w^hen the pulse and general condition 
indicate the need for stimulation. Durina^ the acute stage it is 
usually not required, and when given too early mav intensify 
the cerebral symptoms. As the patient's strength fails it is 
demanded in increasing quantities. 

The convalescence is to be managed as after any acute fever, 
and an abundance of food should be allowed. 

DIPHTHERIA* 

The feeding of diphtheria ])aticnts is carried out along the 
same lines as those laid down for acute fevers in general. 
Owing to the location of the lesion and the frequency with 
which intubation or tracheotomy is performed, special difficul- 
ties arise, and must be met promptly and intelligently, or the 
patient may succumb rapidly. 

The careful management of the diet in diphtheria is of the 
greatest importance. If the patient's nutrition is not main- 
tained, the body will not be able to withstand the effects of the 
poisons that are introduced into the circulation. 

If the disease occurs in a nursing infant, Koplik advises that 
the milk be drawn from the breast with a breast-])umj) and fed 
to the child from a l)ottle or spoon. This is done to avoid 
infection of the breast. If the mother has been rendered immune, 
the danger of ])reast infection is very slight. 

In all cases, if there is any fever, the food should be liquid, 
and should be given in small quantities at regular intervals. 
The most useful of the li(]uid foods are milk, ])lain, with lime- 
water or a carbonated water, or peptonized albumin-vvater ; 
some form of ])redigested beef, as Licjuid Beef Peptonoids or 
Panopepton ; s(jups and gruels and the vai'ious pre])ared foods of 
which malted milk, Kskay's, or Mellin's foods are examples. 

Occasionally semisolids are swallowed with greater ease than 
liquids; in this case any of the foods just mentioned may be 
thickened with well-cooked c(M*eals or gelatin, or custards or 
junket may be given. Ice-cream, if plain, may be allowed in 
small quantities. Kgg-nog nnd milk-])unch are sometimes use- 
iiil, although, as a rule, stimulants are best giveii alone, and not 
combined with the food. 



THE FEEDING IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 401 

If the patient can not swallow, nutrient (uuMnati may he 
resorted to; or, as recommended l)y (iilman Thompson, a nasal 
or a stomach-tuhe may he em])loye(l. If the lattci- mode of 
feeding is adopted, care should he taken to avoid stru^i'^les with 
patients whose hearts are weak. 

Intubation. — After intuhation lias hccn done then; mav or 
may not be some difficulty in swall()win<i^. A,^ a rule, wlicn the 
child swallows for the first time, there may he a slii;lit cou^h or 
some hesitation ; in the majority of cases, liowcvcr, tliis disap- 
pears as the apprehension of the child is alhiycd. Then- may 
be a little difficulty for the first day, but tliis passes oil* ^rachi- 
ally as the muscles become accustomed to work under the new 
conditions. 

Some children find it difficult to close the epiglottis with the 
tube in })Osition, and hence during deglutition some of the ibod is 
likely to be drawn into the larynx or even into the lunL-'s. This 
may cause dyspnea and violent coughing, or when di-awn into 
the lung may give rise to pneumonia. Tliis accident is not 
very likely to occur if perfectly made tubes are u<v(\, and if the 
precaution is taken to press the tube well into place before the 
mouth-gag is removed. 

O'Dwyer believed that food that enters the tube is always 
coughed up and never causes ])neumonia. He recommended 
that, if the child is old enough, he be instructed to take the fo(»d 
as ra})idly as possible and then to cough afterward, instead of 
after each act of deglutition, as he is a})t to do. In some chil- 
dren there may be a slight regurgitation through the nose. 
Taken all in all, the difficulty ex])erienced in feeding tliest^ cases 
is small compared to the enormous benefit the child derives 
from the operation. 

If there is difficulty in swallowing liquids, s(^lid or semisolid 
food may be given instead. Castelberry, of Chieago, suggests 
that the child be placed with his head h)wer than his body. In 
this position swallowing becomes easy. The chihl may also lie 
across the nurse's la]^ with his head thrown well back and down. 
It should always be remembered that food may be refus(Ml 
because of nausea, or because the child has no desire lo take 
anything, as well as owing to any actual dillieulty in swallowing. 

The diet should be the same as in non-ojK^'ative eases, and 
if semisolids or solids are required, soft-boiled or poached eggs, 
milk-toast, custards, junket, bread and milk, oatmeal porridge, 
and similar foods may be given. 

If swallowing becomes impossible, an event that occurs very

rarely, the cliilcl may be fed with the stomach or nasal tube or 
by means of nutrient enemata. 

No especial dietetic rules are necessary for feeding trache- 
otomy cases. 

Postdiphtheritic Paralysis. — In paralysis of the mus- 
cles of deglutition which may occur after diphtheria, most of 
the food may return through the nose ; or if the muscles of the 
tongue as well as the soft palate are involved, deglutition 
becomes impossible. AVhen this occurs, the child must be fed 
with the stomach- or nasal tube or by the rectum. (See 
Gavage). 

ERYSIPELAS. 

The diet in erysipelas is the same as in other acute fevers. 
During the lieight of the disease a liquid diet, given in small 
quantities and repeated at short and regular intervals, is recom- 
mended. As the patient improves a gradual return may be 
made to the ordinary diet. 

Alcohol is useful, and patients with erysipelas, like those with 
septicemia, may take large quantities without producing an 
intoxicating effect. In the severe forms whisky or brandy may 
be given at regular intervals in doses sufficient to maintain the 
heart action. The effect of the stimulation should be watched 
carefully and the amount regulated according to rules previously 
laid down. From sixteen to twenty-four ounces a day may be 
required. 

RHEUMATISM. 

Acute Rheumatism. — Tlie exact relation that diet bears 
to riieumatism has not been proved, and the statement that any 
special diet may act as a ])redisposing factor is conjectural. 
Improper and insufficient food are responsible only in so far as 
they lower the resistauce of the body. 

During the acute attack the management of the diet is simi- 
lar to that of other acute fevers. Some diversity of opinion 
exists as to what constitutes the best diet in these cases. 
Cheadle allows animal broths, and says that he has never seen 
any advantage result from cutting them off entirely. Senator 
|)r('scribes a somewhat more liijeral diet than is given in other 
acute f('V(n's. 

During th(! acute stage the safest place is to put the jKitient 
on a milk or on a milk and fai'inaceous diet. If the patient 
can not take milk, oyster or clam broth, ])referal)ly without the 
oysters or clams, raw oysters, milk-toast, barley or arrow-root 
gruel, buttermilk, kumiss, and, if these are not sufficient, soups 



THE FEEDINC} IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES. K):] 

and brotlis, may be given. It is well, so far as possible, to 
avoid animal broths, and meat-extraets are contraiiKiiiated. 

Tliirst is usually a prominent symptom, and Ibr tl)i> bland or 
acid drinks may be given freely. Lemonade is generally ser- 
viceable, especially since lemons have been advocated in the 
treatment of the disease. C'arbonated water or N'ieliy may be 
used, and milk and carbonated water, bnttermilk, oi- knmi>s 
may be tried. 

Until convalescence is fully established, — that i-, for a week 
or ten days after the fev(!r has subsided, — the patient -honld be 
fed only milk and farinaceons Ibod. The return to solid Ibod 
should be gradual. Fish, oysters, and eggs should be add"(l 
first, followed by chicken and later by other meat-. X'egelables 
may l)e added at the same time, the more easily digotcd, -ueh 
as well-baked potato and well-cooked spinach, cauliflowci- ti>p>, 
stewed celery, and the like, being chosen first. Sweets are to be 
avoided, but fresh fruit may be taken. TIk' patient's strength 
should be fostered, and if there is anemia, the I'eturn t<> the more 
easily digested animal foods should not be delayed too long. 

The meals should not be of sufllicient size to tax the patient's 
digestion, and may be supplemented by two or three extra 
glasses of milk a day, served w^ith a piece of toast or a biscuit, 
or by an egg-nog or a cup of vegetable broth. 

Alcohol is contraindicated in the acute stage oi' the disease, 
but may be prescribed for very weak patients and where cardiac 
complications indicate its use. During convalesecMice, if there 
is continued weakness, it may be employed. 

Chronic Rheumatism. — Where the disease is chronic, 
the diet should be as nourishing as possible. As a rule, sweets 
and meat are best avoided. Fish, eggs, oysters, and tlie lighter 
meats, all fu'inaceous foods, and the more digestible vegeiabh^s, 
particularly the green ones, may be allowed. When tlu» patient 
is very weak and anemic, alcohol may be given if de-ircd ; in 
other cases, where the tonic or stinndant etl'eet is not especially 
indicated, it is to be avoided. Care should be taken not to 
mistake this condition for gout or for arthritis deformans, as is 
so frequently done. 

ASIATIC CHOLERA. 

Infection with the cholera s})irillum takes place through the 
mouth, and is usually caused by drinking contaminated watei'. 
Infection may also be conveyed by milk and by raw vegetables, 
by touching a contaminated object, and by similar methods. 



404 DIET IN DISEASE. 

The disease may be carried by flies, and thus milk and other 
foods may become infected. 

During a cholera epidemic the following prophylactic meas- 
ures are to be carried out. Only the more important ones will 
be mentioned here; for a detailed study of this subject the 
reader is referred to works on Hygiene and on Public Health : 

Fatigue, mental worry, and anything that lowers the mental 
or physical tone should be avoided. 

All exhausting exercises should be excluded, and alcohol 
taken but sparingly, if at all. Disturbances of the stomach or 
bowels should receive prompt treatment, and active purgation 
should be avoided. 

All food should be cooked and all beverages boiled, with the 
exception of those l)ottled and known to be absolutely free from 
any possible contamination with the cholera spirillum. Coffee 
and other similar beverages should be made from boiled water. 
Ice should be made from distilled water, or when this is not 
practicable should not be used in any article of food or drink. 
Only boiled water sliould ])e used for cleansing the teeth. 

All raw vegetables and all food, such as fish or shell-fish, 
that may be partly decomposed, should ])e avoided. Care 
should be taken to secure pure milk. 

Any article of food liable to produce indigestion or diarrhea 
should not be eaten. 

Since the micro-organism causing cholera will not thrive in 
an acid medium, acid drinks are a useful preventive measure 
against infection. Lemonade made with aromatic sulphuric 
acid or dilute sul])huric acid has been widely recommended. 
Ten or fifteen drojis of the acid sliould be added to a glass of 
water. Phosphoric acid and lime-juice, as well as vinegar and 
pickles, are also us(m1. Care should be taken not to disturb the 
digestion by takinii:: too mucli acid, and it should be taken 
tlirough a tube, to ])rotec't tlie te("th. 

The disease is usually divided into four stages; this division 
is, however, arbiti'arv. These stages are : a ])rem()nitorv diar- 
rhea, a severe diarrhea, a stage of colla])se, and a reactionary 
stage. The mildest cases pass through only the first and the 
second stage. The diet for each stage will be indicated further 
on. In addition to the diet, certain general indications for 
trcatiiKjnt may be mentioned. I\enneth MacLeod has sum- 
marized these somewhat as follows: 

The patient should be put to bed and kept absolutely quiet. 
The preliminary diarrhea should be (,'hecked as soon as possible. 
As the circulation tails stinnilants should be given. If the 



THE FEEDING IN INEECTIOrS DISEASES. Klfj 

temperature is excessive, it should he reduced ; if the l)(»dily 
beat is lowered, it should he raised. 

Auy persisteut diarrhea shouhl he cheeked; anv tendciicv to 
vomiting should be rebeved if ])ossible. Thir-t should be al- 
la}XHl, and pain and distress alleviated so far a< po.^.-ible. 

During the stage oi' diarrhea little or no Ibod should be given. 
Acid drinks, and sulphui'ie acid especiallv, niav be a<biiiuistere<l. 
If food is taken, it should be given in verv small (|iianlitv, and 
in the form of albumin-water, beer-juice or pi-edige>tc<i beef 
solutions, barley- or oatmeal-water, or whew Milk is be-t 
avoided, for if it is not digested or absorbed, it forms a nm-t 
excellent culture-medium for the developni<Mit •)!' the chol. i-a 
spirillum. If it is given, it should flr^t be peptoui/cd. 'j^•a 
in small quantities may be allowed if desired, or a little nd 
wine (claret) may be administered. 

In the second stage continuous purging and vomitinir L'cn- 
erally occur. Morphin hypodermically is probablv the be~t 
means of checking these symptoms. A nuistard-plaster over 
the abdomen may give some relief, or turpentine stupes may be 
applied. During this stage no food should be given, Ibr it will 
be rejected. Thirst should be allayed as far as possible by anv 
of the following articles, given in very small (piantities and at 
ten- or fifteen-minute intervals : Cracked ice, cold water, cold 
acid water (dilute phosphoric or sul{)hui'ic acid diluted with 
water), carbonated water, iced lemonade, or lime-juice. Weak 
tea or strong black coffee may also afford relief. If vomiting 
continues, thirst may be assuaged by allowing the patient to 
hold a little iced lemonade or iced water in the mouth without 
swallowing it. 

If mor]>hin does not check the vomiting, it may sometimes 
be relieved by washing out the stomach with normal salt solu- 
tion or Avith Aveak boric acid solution. If the tluid in the 
patient's body is much reduced and the patient })as-es into the 
third, or algid, stage, injections of normal sMlt .-nhition may 
be given subcutaneously or intravenously. \W this means a 
patient is often revived, but, unfortunately, the permanent 
relief hoped for by this method of treatment has not bei-n 
attained. 

When the vomiting ceases and the severe symptoms begin to 
subside, small quantities of food may be given. At tirst a tea- 
spoonful every fifteen minutes may be ti-ied ; and if this is 
retained, the quantity may be increased and the iuterval length- 
ened. Albumin-water, })eptonized milk, and beef-juice or pi'e- 



406 DIET IN DISEASE. 

digested beef solutions should be given at first. The stomach 
often remains irritable for days and weeks after an attack, and 
great care should be exercised not to excite diarrhea or vomit- 
ing. Stimulants, in the form of small doses of iced champagne 
or diluted brandy or whisky, may be administered. 

The convalescence should be conducted as after typhoid fever. 

YELLOW FEVER. 

Tliis disease is usuallv described as presentino: three stages : 
the period of invasion and fever, followed by a period of calm 
or remission. Many mild cases recover without passing into 
the third stage, which is merely an exacerbation of the second 
stage, and is accompanied by black vomit and frequently by 
uremia and collapse. 

Almost all writers aa^ree as to the necessitv of withholdino^ 
all food for the first seventy-two hours of the disease. At the 
outset it is well to give an enema and two or three grains of 
calomel, followed by absolute rest of the stomach so far as the 
giving of food is concerned. As most of the subjects of yellow 
fever are in robust health when stricken, the starvation is well 
borne. If food is given, it is almost certain to be rejected and 
to aggravate the symptoms. During this period Sternberg 
recommends the following mixture : 

Sodium bicarbonate 50 grains 

Mercury bichlorid i grain 

AVater 40 ounces. 

Of this, three tablespoonfuls are to be given ice-cold every 
hour ; a treatment that has been highly praised. Touatre is a 
firm believer in the efficacy of Vichy (Celestins), and admin- 
isters one or two bottles a day. Absolute rest and an abun- 
dance of fresh air are essential adjuncts to the treatment. If 
Vichy can not be obtained, soda-water, one dram to a quart of 
cold water, may be used instead. 

If vomiting is severe, the stomacli should be given absolute 
rest and salt solution be administered by the rectum ; or if the 
rectum l)e('omes irritable and tlie ])atient shou'd become algid, 
the injections may ])e given intravenously, as reconnnentk'd in 
cliolera. 

During the tliird day, if the temperature falls below 102° 
F., a small quantitv of milk and lime-water may be given every 
four hours. This is more likely to be retained if taken cold. 



THE FKKDIM} IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 407 

Gruels, paps, and the like should be avoided, and nothin<;- but 
milk and lime-water or albuniin-watcr may be allowed. Tea 
and other beverages may excite vomitin<:. Anderson, however, 
suggests one small eup oi' freshly prepared tea, drawn but a 
minute or two, to be taken in the moi-ning to I'elroh the patient. 
All solid food should be forbidden until eonvaleseenee is well 
established, as very slight indulgenees have I'esulled fitallv. 

If the patient gets worse instead of better, and if vomiting 
begins again and the diarrhea is severe, all food will be rejected. 
Iced champagne, Rhine wine, or brandy and water may be 
administered in small (piantities at frecpient intervals. l)lack 
coffee may also be employed. Cracked ice, soda-water, lime- 
water, Vichy, or the carbonated waters may be given a ti'ial. 
Thirst may be somewhat relieved by allowing lemonade or 
dilute acid solutions to be held in the mouth rather than swal- 
lowed. Subcutaneous injections of normal salt solution, or in 
very severe cases intravenous injections, may be tried. Mustard 
paste may be applied over the epigastrium or turpentine -tnpes 
may be ordered. Morphin hypodermically is moi-e ellieient in 
relievino; the vomiting than anv other drui^. 

If the severe symptoms abate, nourishment may again be 
attempted. A teaspoonful of albumin-wat(M-, with or without 
a little dilute brandy or champagne, or the same (|Uaiuity of 
peptonized milk or of })redigested beef-solution, may be given. 
If this is retained, it may be re])eated in from twenty minutes 
to half an hour, the quantity being gradually increased and the 
interval lengthened to two hours. The stomach is aj)t to be 
irritable for days, and the food must be liquid and often })redi- 
gested. Peptonized milk, albumin-water, chicken-broth with- 
out fat, and similar fluids may be given. The convalescence is 
to be conducted as after typhoid fever. 

DENGUE. 

The diet in this disease is that of an acute lever. I^)r the 
thirst, freshly ])re])a red and iced carbonated water may b(\uiv(Mi. 
Alcohol is not usually required, except in habitues, and is best 
avoided in the early stages. Severe eases shoidd be treated like 
yellow fever. 

MALARIA. 

During the attack of an intermittent fever the stomach is 
generally irritable, and if food is given it is likely to be vomited. 



408 DIET IN DISEASE. 

If the patient has any desire for food, milk, broths, or gruels 
may be allowed. When the appetite returns, the customary 
diet may be resumed. The diet should be varied, and fruit 
and green vegetables administered to counteract the constipation 
that is usually present. The anemia that follows repeated 
attacks of malaria often requires an especially nutritious and 
invigorating diet, such as is prescribed in the convalescence 
from fevers in general. 

In the prolonged and more or less continuous malarial fevers 
the diet is similar to that of any acute fever. Alcohol may be 
given in the convalescence following the severer forms. Whisky 
is a popular adjunct to treatment, and care should be exercised 
that too much be not taken and injurious habits formed. 

TETANUS. 

In all cases of this disease the efforts should be directed 
toward supplying the patient with the largest possible amount 
of nourishment. Many cases die from exhaustion, due, in part, 
to lack of food. The difficulties of feeding a lock-jaw patient 
can be appreciated only by one Avho has managed a severe case. 
Extreme emaciation and marked anemia, the result of insuffi- 
cient nutriment, are generally present. 

When the disease is not severe, liquid nourishment can 
usually be given without difficulty by allowing the food to 
pass between the teeth. This is rendered easier when a tooth 
is missing. If the teeth are so regular and fit so closely 
together as to keep all food out, nasal or rectal feeding may be 
tried. In these cases food should be given every one or two 
hours, and from one to several ounces should be taken at a time. 
Milk, which should be partially peptonized, milk-jnmch, eg^:;- 
nog, albumin-water, panopepton and water or any reliable liquid 
predigested beef, meat broths, and stimulants should be admin- 
istered. Milk, if it agrees with the patient and can be given 
in sufficient quantities, is very useful. 

In severe cases any attempt to handle the j)atient or to feed 
him is likely to bring on a convulsion. This is as true of rectal 
feeding as of mouth-feeding. In some cases rectal feeding may 
be successful. In these difficult cases anesthesia may be in- 
duced by chloroform, and if the jaws relax sufficiently, a 
stomach-tube may be [)assed and a pint of predigested food 
and stimulant poured into the stomach. In many cases a nasal 
tube can be used to good advantage. 



THE FEEDING IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 409 

RABIES. 

The Tnanagoment of ihv. diet in ra])l('s is substantially tlie 
same as in tetanus. In most cases even the sliiililot move- 
ments about the patient may excite violent spasms. When this 
is the ease, all attempts at ieedinu-, whether by mouth, na.-al 
tube, or rectum, must be discontinued. O.-ler h:is >iiLiLi('>le<l 
tliat the throat be cocaini/ed so as to le.-sen the .-pa>ms and 
permit the patient to swallow. \\'hene\('r possibh', this should 
be done, but it can not generally be aceompli-^hed. if the 
patient is suffering from hunger, chloroibrm may be adminis- 
tered by inhalation to the point of relaxation, and food be gi\-en 
by the stomach- or nasal tube or by the i-ectum. Since all 
cases of rabies are fatal, the pitient's suflerings -honld not be 
augmented by ineffectual efforts to administei* food. One who 
has never seen a case of rabies can not realize the extent oi" the 
suftering that attempts at feeding may induce. 

TUBERCULOSIS. 

The importance of proper diet in tnl)erculosis lia- been 
dwelt upon since the time of PTip})oci'ates. Areta'us mentions 
the use of milk in the treatment of ])hthisical jxitients. (Quo- 
tations pregnant with facts relating to the value of ]M-oper ibod 
might be added from almost every medical writer oC promi- 
nence. Osier sums up the matter as follows : '^ As a healing 
of a tuberculous process is largely de])endent upon the state 
of nutrition, the question of diet becomes of the very first 
importance.^' 

In a disease with such protean manifestations there are many 
points that must be considered. As the malady usually attacks 
the lungs, this section ^vill deal principally with pulmonary 
tuberculosis, for if the dietetic management of a ea.-e <»{' pul- 
monary phthisis is understood thoroughly, there will be no diili- 
culty in modifying it to meet the re([uirements of other tbrms 
of the disease. 

From the outset the patient nuist be impressed with the fact 
that diet is of primary importance in the treatment of the 
disease, and whenever he displays a tendency to become care- 
less in this regard, the injunctions concerning diet nuist be 
repeated. Directions should not be given in a general way, 
but should be specific, covering both the articles to be eaten 
and those to be avoided. The time for taking food and the 



410 DIET IN DISEASE, 

amount to be taken should be carefully outlined. These points 
vary with different patients, but each case must be studied in- 
dividually if success is to be attained. It is generally better to 
give written instructions concerning the diet, as the patient is 
apt to be forgetful, especially if he has certain strong likes and 
dislikes. 

Care should be taken to give only such directions as the 
condition of the patient will warrant carrying out. A good 
diet and fresh air at home are to be preferred to starvation in 
a more suitable climate. The patient should not be permitted to 
spend too much of his money on railroad fare and too little on food. 

While tliis is true, one should not lose sight of the fact that 
to obtain the best results, the patient must have an abundance 
of fresh air, and carefully regulated hours of rest and exercise, 
and tlie whole life must be so ordered as to secure as great 
freedom froin care and worry as is possible. 

The necessity of studying individual requirements is very 
great, and the best results are obtained where the physician 
directs the diet and life of the patient with professional skill 
and common sense. In a general way it may be stated that no 
tuberculosis j^atient can get along on too little food, and this 
has led to rather universal overfeeding, and many overeat, 
and, indeed, with some physicians and some patients, overeating 
becomes a fixed idea. 

The aim should be to cure the patient, and not to make what 
some one has termed a flabby, breathless, inert mass. A smaller 
diet, well digested and assimilated, is much better than over- 
feeding. Hyperalimentation may l)e used in certain cases under 
supervision, but it often leads to gastric and intestinal irrita- 
bility, with vomiting and diarrhea, foul breath, coated tongue, 
drowsiness, headaches, and in some patients there may be an 
unfortunate obesity. 

The best diet for a tuberculous patient has not been definitely 
determined, but valuable work has been done along this line, and 
the subject is much better understood than it was a few years 
ago. The 'question resolves itself into what foods are best for 
the tuberculosis ])atients, and how much should they be given. 
In other words, what amounts of jn-otein, carbohydrates, and fats 
will give the best results. Jt is manifestly im])ossible to make 
a definite dietary for a disease in which the conditions are neces- 
sarily so varia})le, but some general deductions may be made 
which may serve as a standard and as a })oint of departure for 
individualizing. 

As regards the amount of protein food recpiired, there are 



THE FEEDING IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 411 

different opinions. Nitrotj^en e{|uilil)riuni may l)e established 
and maintained at various levels, from as low as oO or (JO 
grams of protein for the average-sized indi\idual up to \'1() 
grams as an average amount, and heyoud this to some I oO or 
160 grams a day, although these latter amounts may, in some 
individuals, eause symptoms. The lower ligur(s are, undouht- 
edly, too low for the eonsumptive, and jx'i-haps the hcst results 
are obtained by the higher figures, as lull amoiuits of uiti-(»g- 
enous food undoubtedly stinudate the body's ])o\\('r of rc-isl- 
ance. Too high nitrogen intake eauses unnecessary wear and 
tear on the organs, and the amount should iie\('i- be so gi'eat as 
to cause the symptoms commonly described by the term " biliou>- 
ness." Bardswell and Campbell, as the result of earel'ul feed- 
ing with weighed diets, have suggested that, as a i-ule, the pi"o- 
tein should be increased about .']() per cent. abo\'e what would 
be indicated for the patient if in health under conditions oi' 
re])ose — /. e., up and about, but not doing nuiscular labor — and 
this increase should be maintained until the disease has entirely 
disappeared. If the patieht is under weight, there should be a 
30 percent, increase either in carbohydrates or fats, or partly of 
each, until the patient has gained a few })oun(ls more than the 
normal weiglit bef )re being infected, unless this Aveight should 
have happened to be an abnormally high one, as in the obese. 
When this point is reached, a lo per cent, decivase may be 
made, and this diet continued until the patient is cured. In 
an average-sized individual this brings the total f )od intake up 
to about 3500 calories per day. King has suggested that the 
amount of food taken should be between .")() and 40 calories 
per kilo of body weight. Large, vigorous individuals, with good 
digestive powers, may take more, while smaller individuals and 
those who lead sedentary lives, recpiire less. A\\)men, as a rule, 
require slightly less food than men of the same size and weight. 

Diets low in protein are not suitable for consumptives, and 
insufficient diet, which is very often due to ])overty or ignorance 
of how to buy and prepare food, is a fre(]uent causc^ of failure 
in treatment. If the tuberculous ])atient is unable to si'cui-e a 
sufficient nutritious food, his chances of recoxcry, or even of 
maintaining a fair degree of bodily health and etlieieney, are 
very slight. Insufficient consideration is given to the economic 
side of the diet question in dealing with })oor ju'ople. The 
physician must be able to advise as to the foods which have a 
high food value, are jmlatable, and have a \(^\v cost. 

An effort should be made to have the food taken in as con- 
centrated a form as possible, as individuals with weak stomachs 



412 DIET IN DISEASE. 

may have digestive troubles started if the bulk is too great. 
This is not so important in working people, as their diet is ordi- 
narily rather bulky. In fact, sometimes if people accustomed to 
bulky diets are given the same food value in more concen- 
trated form they complain that it does not satisfy their hunger. 

It is exceedingly important to keep in mind tlie individual 
requirements, and some ])atients undoubtedly do better on a diet 
containing smaller amounts of protein. The excreting powers, 
the patient's general appearance and condition, and other points 
to be appreciated only by actual exjKTience, are of great value 
in regulating the diet of the tuberculous patient. A diminution 
of the amount of food taken may be necessitated by too rapid 
gain in weight, or by too much nausea and vomiting, or by 
other evidences of e:astr()-intestinal disturbance. A fat indieres- 
tion calls for a reduction in the amount of fat taken, and the 
increase in the dietary in those cases may often be made up by 
a corresponding increase in the carbohydrates. A reduction in 
the amount of carbohydrates may be indicated where there is 
intestinal indigestion. 

A meat-free diet is sometimes advised, and it Avould seem that 
in early cases, w^ith powerful digestion, it may be substituted for 
the ordinary diet. Its only advantage, however, is its cheap- 
ness. When the appetite and digestion are poor, as concen- 
trated a diet as possible is advised, as the meat-free diet is too 
l)ulky and liable to cause gastric and intestinal indigestion, and 
this, in turn, a lessened absorption. Vegetables are more diffi- 
cult to render ]ialatable and recpiire more skill in their prepara- 
tion, a [)oint often overlooked by vegetarian enthusiasts. 

The nutrition of the patient is a reliable guide as to th^ 
progress of the disease. If he is takiug sufficient nutritious 
food, is digesting it, and is gaining in weight, the prognosis is 
good. If the reverse is the case, the prognosis is bad. A per- 
sistent inability to digest food is always an unfavorable symp- 
tom. Care should be taken to avoid disturbing the stomach 
by the use of nauseating drugs. Patients are too frequently 
dosed excessively with crcasote, cod-liver oil, cough mixtures, 
and hypophosphites, while milk and eggs are not given often 
enough or only in insufficient quantities. 

Irritability of the stomach should receive early and the most 
careful consideration. It is usually due to fever, anemia, the 
swallowing of sputum, or impro])er food or drugs. If due to 
fever, care in selecting the diet, as will be described hereaft.er,

form are helpful. In nil cases tlie patient should he instrueted 
not to swallow the sputum, as irrltahility of the stomacli with 
vomitmo^ is almost certain to follow sooner or later. He should

One should he certain that he is not ta kino; n patent medicine in 
addition to what has been prescribed tor him. " (^uiek ciu'cs'' 
are always attractive, and are often iiidnlHcd in secretlv, to the 
great detriment of the patient. A su>peii>ion of all di-uws iVom 
time to time will do nmch to relieve the overdo.-ed stomach. 
In some Individuals irritability and nausea may be brought on 
by the too continuous administration of iuiv <»ne d^u^■. 

The appetite, since it is generally poor and ca()ricioii<, is not 
a good guide as to the amount of food to be taken. In most 
cases more food can be digested than the appetite demands. 
While this is so, the desires of the patient should, nevertheless, 
be consulted so far as possible, and more good can generallv be 
accomplished by humoring the patient's reasonable demands 
than by combating them. The character of each patient should 
be studied, and in this condition particularly tact })lays an 
Important role. A nurse or a physician with natural tact and 
sympathy will often manage to get suificient food into an in- 
tractable or capricious patient where skill and \vant of Uict 
would fail completely. 

Tiie food should be ready at the time the meal is served, and 
the service should be prompt, so that the patient is not tii-ed 
out waiting between courses, and also, that lu^ does not lose his 
appetite and patience. The plate should not })v piled full of 
food which the patient is expected to 'eat, as smaller and repeated 
helpings have been found to be better. Congenial table com- 
panloMs are a great stinudus to eating, and many ])atients eat 
fairly well If seated with others who are cheerful and have good 
ap})etites. 

Other factors to be considered are the nationality and the u-ual 
mode of life of the patient. ]Many of the diet-lists intended tor 
tuberculous patients are taken from the works of (Jenuan writer.-. 
A German or a German-American might thri\'e upon tlie<e, 
whereas an Englishman, a Frenchman, or an American would 
find it difficult to take some of the articles advised. 

In the choice and preparation of food the utmost care should be 
exercised. Detweiler's saying, '^'^^Nly kitchen is my phai'macy,*' 
holds in these cases. The food should be jircpared simply, and 
yet should be varied and made as tem})tlng as })ossil)le. 

The stomach and intestine >hould be watched, and consti- 
pation promptly relieved. Patients who are taking large (pian- 



414 DIET IN DISEASE. 

titles of food and resting much of the time are apt to be costive. 
Sugars and starches are rarely well borne. This may be due to 
tlie })resence of catarrhal conditions of the bowel, but may also 
be true even when catarrh is not present. Young, growing 
girls often crave sweets, and when this craving is indulged in 
to excessj the stomach and digestion become disordered. 

While sufficient food should be given, an excess is injurious, 
and each patient should be watched carefully. Not more should 
be given at one time than the patient can digest wdth ease. 
Bardsw^ell and Chapman, in their studies on metabolism in 
tuberculosis, found that some patients who were taking very 
large quantities of food and were gaining in weight were 
excreting excessive amounts of urea — over 900 grains daily. 
These patients generally maintained their normal weight, and 
the disease appeared to be quiescent. For economic reasons 
they were obliged to reduce the diet of the patients, and found 
that, instead of producing disastrous results, a gain in weight 
and general improvement followed. These patients, of course, 
were being somewhat overfed. 

liest is important, and the patient should be instructed to 
rest before and after meals ; if he is not receiving the combined 
rest and diet cure, to be s})oken of later, he shoidd lie down at 
least half an hour before and after meals. 

Coughing is sometimes excited by the taking of food. If 
this is due to laryngeal involvement, it should be managed 
according to directions given under Diseases of the Larynx. 
AVhen it is due to the ])ressure of an overfilled stomach, the 
meals may be smaller and closer together. Gavage or feeding 
by means of a soft-rubber tube may be emj^loyed in those cases 
that vomit everything they eat because swallowing brings on a 
s])asmodic cough. 

The care of tlie moutli is of great importance. It is well to 
rinse the mouth before and after eating. The teeth also sliould 
be ke})t scrupulously clean. Knopf advises the use of the fol- 
lowing mixture after meals :

Foods to be Used by Tuberculous Patients. — 
Milk. — This is one of the most important articles of diet for 



THE FEFA)INa L\ INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 4 IT) 

tlie tuberculous patient. Unless some special reason exists, 
milk should always form a part of the diet. It mav he taken 
with the meals or be ji^iven bc^tweeii th<' interval- of Ircdinu'. It 
is of the utmost im])ortan(!e that the milk be sipped slo\\l\', and 
uot swallowed (juickly in lai-<!;e (piantities. The milk mav l»e 
taken plain, or may be modified in varicuis wavs. Lime-water 
may be added, with or without the addition of cream ; car- 
bonated water may be mixed with it, or the milk mav be p<'p- 
tonized. Buttermilk or kumiss may be taken if de.-ired. 

Eggs, when they can be taken in suificient cpiantities, are 
also of the greatest value. In certain cases, however, thev mav 
not be well borne. If the entire eut^ can not be taken, the 
whites alone may be given. Egg-all)nniin often rendei-s mo.-t 
efficient service in helping to nourish these patients. The 
whites of from six to twenty-four eggs beaten up lightlv and 
strained through a cloth may be taken daily. A ver\' >mall 
pinch of salt and a little lemon-juice or other llav(»ring sub- 
stance may be added. Given in this way, a large numln'r of 
eggs can easily be taken, and are almost invariably well borne. 
If the patient can digest the eggs entire, they may be very bghtly 
boiled, or, as a change, they may be made into a light omelet or 
poached. Hard-boiled and fried eggs should not be eaten. 

Meat. — Meat of all kinds, if ])roperly ])re])ared, may be 
eaten; but '' high '^ game, highly seasoned dishes, and twice- 
cooked meats sliould be avoided. Beef and mutton are the 
most suitable varieties. l\aw meats, especially raw beet", have 
been highly extolled by French writers. The experinKutal 
Avork of llichet and Hericourt on dogs, tending to sliow the 
value of raw meat, has been much criticised. ("ornil and 
Chantemesse recently contributed to this subject by their ex- 
periments on dogs. Placed under similar conditions, some of 
the animals were fed on raw meat and others on cooked, and 
both series were inoculated with virulent tubercle bacilli. The 
doffS fed on cooked meat all died in a short time oi" tiibefculosis, 
while those fed on raw meat lived. Some of the animals, at 
the time in apparent good health, were killed and showed 
tuberculous deposits. Others lived in ap])arent good health, and 
on beins: killed a vear later showed tuberculous ck'posits in a 
condition of healing. 

Galbraith has recently shown that the exhibition of raw meat 
is followed by a marked increase of nitrogen retention, ])rovided 
the heat value and nitrogen of the diet exceeded the actual re- 
quirements of the individual per kilo, of body weight. He 
also found that there was an improvement in the intestinal me- 



416 DIET IN DISEASE. 

tabolism, and this improvement lasts some time after the return 
to the use of cooked meat. In Gralbraith's patients there was a 
rapid increase in the hemoglobin, and the digestive leukocytes 
was remarkably increased. 

Grancher suggests that for tuberculous patients the raw meat 
be given in the form of a finely divided pulp. This is prepared 
by scraping the meat with a knife, which will result in a mass 
of shredded meat-fiber. This is placed in a mortar and pounded 
and rubbed with a pestle until quite smooth. It is then pressed 
gently through a sieve to remove any larger particles. This 
raw meat-pulp is very easily digested and highly nutritious. It 
may be given in various ways, as spread on sandwiches or given 
in milk or in warm bouillon. It may be mixed with purees of 
various kinds or with vegetables, or, in the case of children, 
with small quantities of preserves. It may be rolled into balls 
and so easily swallowed, or it may be served with an egg, with 
anchovies, or with pickled herring. 

Meat-juice is also of great value. This may be prepared 
according to any of the recipes given in the Appendix, or 
the juice may be expressed from beef by means of a meat- 
press. Good round steak should be very slightly broiled, cut 
into small cubes, and the juice pressed out. AVith a good 
press about eight ounces of juice can be extracted from a pound 
of meat. This should be seasoned and heated by placing the 
vessel containing it in warm water. Care should be taken not 
to heat it too thoroughly, or the albumin will coagulate and the 
juice be spoiled. Freshly prepared beef-juice is always prefer- 
able, but when this can not be obtained, liquid beef peptonoids, 
predigested beef, or ^losquera Beef Meal may be employed. 

J. C. Iloux and Josias have used the raw-meat cure in 
children with good results. No cooked meat was allowed these 
patients. 

For patients who can not or will not take raw beef, very rare 
steak, roast-beef, or beef soup should be prescribed. 

Fish. — Fresh fish, boiled, broiled, or baked, may be allowed. 
Both oysters and clams from which the hard portion has been 
removed may be eaten, preferably raw, but they may also be 
given stewed, roasted, or broiled. 

Cereals. — Where these can l)e digested, they are of value. 
In the early stages of the disease they serve not only as nutri- 
ment, but also aid in regulating the bowels, and are usually 
easily digested. If th(>re is (H)nstipation, they are of espin^ial 
value. Oatmeal, whcaten grits, cornmeal nuisli, and rice and 
milk are the most suital)le fi)rms. 



THE FKKDINd IS ISFECTIOl'S DISKASI-.S. 417 

Vegetables. — Any of the easily (liL^otc;! vrHci:il)I('< may W. 
allowed. They should he steamed or cookcil with as litth* 
water as ])Ossihle, to avoid dissolviiiu- out the -ah-, which, 
together with much of tlie nuti'imcnl, ai-c thi-own awav \s itli

Bread. — Wheat or rye hread, or mixtures of hoih, ma\' l)e 
used. Zwieback is of _<»reat vahie. All hot hivad.-, j)a-tj-v, aii<l 
cakes should be avoided. 

Fruit. — All fresli and perfectly ripe fruit may he allowed 
in moderation. It shoidd be taken the first thiiiLi- in the moiii- 
ing or as a dessert, leaked a])})les and oranges are well boi-ne 
and useful, and grapes, peaches, j)ears, and othei- tVuit in -ea-n!i 
may be allowed. 

Fats. — In tuberculosis, when fats and oils can be taken and 
absorbed, the prognosis is always much bett(>r than when th<se 
can not be tolerated. While tluw are of the gi-eatest value in 
treatment, care should be taken not to disturb the patient's 
dio:estion bv forciuo; more fatty foods into the dietarv than the 
stomach will tolerate. Most })atients, however, soon ae(|iiire a 
dislike for fats of all kinds. They are best given in the form 
of cream and butter; the yolks of eggs, crisj) fat bacon, and 
olive oil are also useful. C\)d-liver oil is really as nuich a food 
as a medicine. Kither the plain oil or an emiil>ion may be 
used, and the doses should be small to begin with and gradually 
be increased. A common mistake is to administei- the oil in 
excessive quantities. Only perfectly sweet I'resh oil is to he 
used, as rancid or stale oil may disturl) the digestion. It- u-e 
should be discoutinued from time to time. Children bear oil 
better than do adults. If there is a tendency to diari-hea, fat- 
and oils must be used with caution. 

Alcohol. — There is much diversity of opinion concerning:- the 
influence of alcohol on tul)ercidosis. Three views have been 
expressed, and each has its supporters : 

1. That alcoholism is antagonistic to tuhei'culo-is. 

2. That alcoholism exerts no special inllueiice on the indi- 
vidual as regards tuberculosis. 

3. That alcoholism definitely predisposes to tul)erculo-i<. 

The last view has the largest number of supporters, as alco- 
holism probably renders the body more susc(^ptible to all in- 
fections. Osier has stated his opinion as f )llows : "It was 
formerly thought that alcohol was in some way antagonistic to 
tuberculous disease, but the observations of late years indicate 
clearly that the reverse is the case, and that chronic drinkers 
are much more liable to both acute and ])idmonary tuberculosis. 

27' 



418 DIET IN DISEASE. 

It is probably altogether a question of altered tissue-soil, the 
alcohol lowering the vitality and enabling the bacilli more readily 
to develop and grow.'^ 

Concerning the use of alcohol in the treatment of tubercu- 
losis, it may be said that, except in the last stages of the disease, 
it is best avoided. Nationality and habits, however, must not 
be disregarded. To those habituated to the use of a glass of 
wine or beer with their dinner, this may be allowed. The 
quantity taken must be limited to the smallest reasonable allow- 
ance. This Avill vary with each individual. 

Patients who are gaining in weight or who are in good con- 
dition are better oif without alcohol. Those who are going down- 
hill, may often take light wine, beer, or well-diluted spirits with 
advantage. Of the last, well-matured, pure whisky is the best. 

Patients with high fever who are in an exhausted condition 
may be given alcohol freely, following the same rules as were 
laid down in the general consideration of fevers. In these 
cases alcohol is given as a food, and is, as a rule, very well 
borne. In these advanced cases pure Avhisky well diluted is 
perhaps the best form of alcoholic stimulant, but the patient's 
taste may be consulted in this respect. 

Other Beverages. — The usual beverages may be given in 
moderation. In chronic tuberculosis cocoa may be taken night 
and morning with good effect. Tea or coffee may be allowed 
in small quantities unless they ])roduce unfavorable symptoms. 
Milk and milk-j^unch, buttermilk, lemonade, or orangeade may 
be used, and malt extracts are often of benefit. 

Number of Meals. — Food may be given from three to six 
times daily. On rising, milk may be taken, or, if desired, a 
cup of bouillon instead. Tliis nuiy be followed by breakfast, 
and about the middle of the morning a glass of milk, egg- 
albumin, beef-juice, or broth may be given with a cracker or a 
piece of toast. 

A midday dinner should be the rule, and during the middle 
of the afternoon a light lunch of scraj)ed beef, milk, or some 
similar food may be; given. 

Supper may be taken at a convenient evening hour, and 
before going to bed a glass of milk may be drunk. If desired 
or if deemed necessary, a small amount of licpiid nourishment 
may be taken during the night if the patient awakens. As a 
rule, however, it is well to give the stomach a full night's rest. 
In severe cases, where only small (piantities of liquid or semi- 
solid food are taken, the intervals should be sh(jrtened to every 
two or three liours. 



TiiK Fi:i:i)is(; ix iM'hCTiocs 1)1si:asks. \\\) 

Feeding Advanced Cases. — In advanced crises paticnin 
may generally be permitted to select their <liet. Tlie^e patients 
can often eat hearty meals with a relish and appaniitlv digest 
them without difficulty. As a rule, their diet inu.-t l»e li^dit, 
liquid, or semisolid. The same princi})les may he applied liere 
as in feeding fever cases, with the exception that the patient's 
desires should, as far as ])ossil)le, he o-nitified. 

Phthisis Cures. — Various diet (;ures have heen advo- 
ciited for the relief of phthisis, and these are referred to luider 
the head of Diet Cures. The benefit which follows their use- 
is due laro'cly to the fresh air and abundance offx.d ihey pre-ei-ilM'. 

If the patient is well-to-do and can aiVoid a lihcral dielai'v 
there is little difliculty in const met in^- a sirual)le diet li-t L^ixin;;- 
approximately the })roper amounts oi" protein, eai'bohvdiatc-, and 
fats with a total number of calories sullicienily lart^c to '/\\r the 
best results. The exact amount of food recpiired i> nio-i ca-ily 
determined by ordering a diet which will contain about -"Wl per 
cent, more protein food than would be i-e(piired by the patient 
ordinarily if not workiuii; and increasing- the carbohydiaies. 
This can easily be done by addinu^ o or 4 ])ints of milk or 1 
quart of milk and 2 to 4 eggs to just about such a diet ol" plain 
food as the majority of w^ell-to-do ])eople consmne. 

This may be given as follows : 

If desired a glass of milk may be given early before break- 
fast before the patient has got out of bed. 

Breakfad. — A glass of milk ; this may be ilavorcd with tea 
or coffee and taken from a coffee cuj), if desired. If the ])atient 
wishes it an orange or a small amount of sonu^ other fruit, an 
ordinary helping of oatmeal, 2 soft-boiled or ])oached eggs, 2 
slices of toast or bread, luid J ounce of butter. A small j>icccof 
bacon may be taken \vith the (i^^\:!:r^ if desired, oi- an oidiuary 
helping of meat or fish may be sul)stituted. In the middle of 
the morning, at 10. oO or 11. .")(), a glass of milk. 

Luncheon. — A glass of milk, a helping of fish oi' a chop or 
a piece of steak or some meat entree, a slice of bread or t.i;i-i oi" 
a roll, J ounce of butter, a ])otato or a helpiui:- of rice or liominy 
or the equivalent. A green vegetable, as spiniich or a leiniccor 
tomato salad, and a dessert of junket, bread ])udding, baked 
custard, or some similar nutritious dish. 

In [)lace of afternoon tea, a glass of milk with a few slices of 
bread and butter. 

Dinner. — A glass of milk, a small amount of soup if desired, 
and if it does not interfere with tlu' a])petitc, an entree if desired, 
a good helping of some substantial plain meat^ as roast beef. 



420 DIET IN DISEASE. 

mutton, or lamb, or chicken, guinea-hen or turkey, potatoes, or 
a farinaceous vegetable and a green vegetable, a salad if desired, 
dessert, and a small piece of cheese. 

At Bedtime. — A glass of milk. 

The above works out approximately as follows : 

Food. Protein. Fat. hydfales. Calories.^ 

Grams. Grams. Grams. 

Milk, 3 pints 57 70 87

169 171 302 3480.4 

The milk taken at meal time should be drunk at tlie end of the 
meal and not at the beginning, so as not to interfere with the 
appetite. 

The dinner may be taken in the middle of the day if desired, 
and the rather lighter meal taken as supper in the evening. 

Diets for the poorer classes of the people should be so arranged 
as to be more or less like the diet to which they are accustomed, 
both in composition and price. This means tliat the dietary is 
more bulky, contains more carbohydrates and less fat. The ad- 
ditional protein and carbohydrate and fat can be conveniently and 
chea])ly added in a quart of milk, meat, beans, peas, or lentils, 
and butter. Where price is a very great item skim milk may be 
used in part or entirely and oleomargarin substituted for the 
butter. Beans, hominy, cornmeal, lentils, dried peas, and similar 
articles of diet may be used in large quantities and the chaiper 
cuts of meat substituted. There is not always any real economy in 
chea])er cnts of meat, as some of them contain comparatively little 
nutriment. In cities where tliere are markets, by purchasing 
just before the market closes, odds and ends of various cuts 
may often be bought at very low prices and to greater ad- 
vantage from the stand])oint of food value than cheaper cuts. 

The diet in .sanitariums and li()S])itals for consumptives is car- 
ried on in the same manner as in ])rivate practice. The fallowing 
is from Bardswell and Canipl)ell, and gives a very good standard 
in the present state of our knowledge of the subject. Iinli- 
vidual variations must be made just as in ])rivate practice :

N. B. — The wcio'hts given are the iiiininumi ([uaiitiiic- which 
patients are pre.seribed ; second hel})ings of meat, piiddiiiLi, and 
butter are allowed if asked for. 

Milk is not given botli at T.oO a. m. and 12 ipani, but it is 
left to the patient's choice at wliich time it is taken. 

Jfeat (A). — At breakfa.<t, on ditfeniit da}s of the week, nnc of 
the following is ])rovided : 

Bacon, ham, fish, tongue, or sausage. 

Meat (B). — At lunch, consists of one of the I'nllowing : 

Roast or boiled beef, hot or cold. 

Roast or boiled mutton, hot or cohk 

Beefsteak and kidney pudding, stewed steak or Irisli stew, or 
liver and bacon. 

Chicken J roast lamb, veal, or pork occasionally. 



422 DIET IN DISEASE. 

3Ieat (C). — At dinner, consists of one of the following: 

Hot roast or boiled beef, hot roast or boiled mutton, hot 
roast lamb. 

The compulsory diets, which are printed in italics, and 
which are prescribed in weighed and measured amount, as shown 
in the table, give diets of the following nutritive values : 

Men. — Proteid, 144 gm.; fat, 160 gm.; carbohydrate, 270 * 
gm.; calories, 3186. 

Women. — Proteid, 126 gm.; fat, 160 gm.; carbohydrate, 220 
gm.; calories, 2814. 

Gastric Irritability. — Gastric irritability is a troublesome 
symptom in many cases of tuberculosis. Care in avoiding nau- 
seous drugs and preparations will have much to do in prevent- 
ing it. The patient must also be enjoined strictly not to swallow 
the sputum. If the attack is severe, the patient should be 
placed on a liquid diet, consisting chiefly of milk in some form, 
diluted or peptonized. Buttermilk and kumiss are valuable in 
this condition and are often well borne. Fresh meat-juice and 
broths may be allowed, and the various peptonized dishes men- 
tioned in the Appendix may be given to lend variety to the diet. 
Scraped meat mixed with milk or prepared in the form of small 
balls is often of service. The predigestcd liquid beef prej^ara- 
tions are useful, and may be given diluted with water. Pano- 
pepton poured over crushed ice is sometimes retained when 
everything else is rejected. Egg-albumin is also usually re- 
tained. 

Alcohol may be used in tlie later stage of tlie disease or when 
the patient is very weak. Old brandy mixed with a small 
quantity of a cold carbonated water or teaspoonfiil doses of iced 
chami^agne are advised in the very serious cases. Larger doses 
may be given in the less severe cases. 

Food and drink should b(> given in small quantities at short 
intervals — one to four ounces every two or three hours, or twice 
as nuich at longer intervals. The quantity taken should be 
measured carefully and recorded, as otherwise the patient may 
receive an insuflicient diet or be given a superabundance. In 
severe cases washing out the stomach gives more relief than 
any otlier procedure. In less severe cases a glass of hot water 
with or without sodium bicarbonate may be taken on rising, 
and at least half an hour before eating, or j)referably an hour 
before. 

If no food is retained, forced feeding by means of a stomach- 
tube may })e tried. This is known as Debove's method. 
I^arge quantities — 8 to 16 ounces — may sometimes be retained

when given by tho tube that, if swallowed, woiiM be i-ejected at

may be resorted to. 

Fever. — If there is fever, the question of fcedint:- the patient 
should be carefully considered. If tlu'rc is much irritabilitv of 
tlie stomach, the general rules ibr ieeding leNcr j)ati('nts niav be 
followed. If digestion is not disturbed and the appetite is good, 
the patient may be allowed a light diet, of which milk should 
form a large part ; as a rule, it is best given cold. 'Hie usual 
liquid food may also be allowed. Sou])s, white meat of ehieken, 
raw or rare roast-beef, or underdone nuitton are indicated. 
Boiled, broiled, or baked tish and oysters and the nioi-e <'asily 
digested vegetables are permissible. The patient's sui-roundings 
have considerable influence on his a])petite, and when possible, 
he should take his meals while reclining on a porch or in a 
sun-parlor, amid perfect quiet. The excitement and fatigue of 
a meal in the dining-room are best avoided. 

If solid food docs not (U/rec^ the jxitic/it sfion/d he jtlacrd on o 
liquid diet. Generally, however, a tuberculous patient with 
fever will do remarkably well on a general diet. Milk, lemonade, 
and similar preparations are useful, recipes ibr which will be 
found in the Appendix. 

The diet for the more advanced cases has been indicated. 

Forced Feeding (Suralimentation). — Debove discov- 
ered accidentally that food introduced by means of a stomach- 
tube was retained when, if taken by the mouth, it would be 
rejected. He therefore turned his attention to the treatment 
of tuberculous patients by means of this method, and met with 
a measurable success. This form of treatment Is especially 
applicable in those cases where there are an irritable stomach 
and no appetite. 

Food is introduced into the stomach by the tube at regular 
intervals. Milk, peptonized or diluted, ground-meat mixtures, 
eggs and milk, albumin-water, beef-juice, predigested beef 
preparations, and similar liquid foods may be utilized ibr this 
purpose. 

When, during fever, the patient's appetite and will-power wyv 
equal to it, feeding maybe conducted in the usual way, without 
the tube. Moderate quantities of easily digested ibod may be 
given at frequent intervals. Two or thrc(^ rather substantial 
meals form the basis of the diet, while on rising, at bedtime, 
and during the intervals between meals li(|uid ibod is to Ix^ 
ordered. Under this method of treatment certain cases gain

very rapidly and recover their usual weight in a short time. 
As soon as the customary weight of the patient is reached, it is 
well to diminish the quantity of food given, so as to avoid the 
effects of overfeeding, which show themselves in a coated tongue, 
a heavy breath, torpidity, and the train of symptoms popularly 
known as biliousness. Should these symptoms arise, a saline 
or small doses of calomel, together with a reduction in the 
amount of food given, Avill give prompt relief. Gastric catarrh 
and fever are contraindications to suralimentation. 

DIET IN DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. 

In diseases of the stomach the selection of a proper diet is 
often of more importance than the choice of drugs. No abso- 
lute dietetic regulations can be formulated in this class of dis- 
ejises, but it is important to regulate the food in conformity with 
the particular disease with which the })atient is affected, and 
also to consider the individual tastes and peculiarities of the 
patient ; even in the regulation of a diet in any special disease 
of the stomach changes are often rendered necessary ; these 
must be made gradually and according to the patient's power to 
digest the food. 

Food is said to be easily digestible when it produces no gas- 
tro-intestinal discomfort, is passed from the stomach into the 
intestine at a normal rate of speed, and is easily absorbed. 
Under norn}al conditions the digestibility of foods is easily 
ascertained, for the motor and secretory functions of the stom- 
ach being normal, the effect of the food upon one or both of 
these functions can readily be determined ; in the various gas- 
tric disturbances, however, tliis ])roblem is more difhcult, for 
here there may be a motor or a secretory disturbance, or both 
functions may l)e impaired. In determining the diet for a 
special gastric disturbance two ])()ints nmst be borne in mind : 
first, the power to increase the nutrition of the ])atient, and, 
secondly, the necessity of giving food in a digestible form, so 
as to lessen the work of the stomach. Leube lias devised a 
scale of the various artich's of food, given in the order of 
their digestibility. This sc;de forms the l)asis of the well-known 
Leube '' ulcer d'iet." 

I/CUbe^S Diet Scale.' — hid I. — If the dig(>stion is very 
much reduced, the following articles of food are most easily di- 
gestible : bouillon, meat solution, milk, raw or soft-boiled eggs.

boiled calves' feet in addition to the various meat lood> already 
enumerated. 

Bid JIL—ir Diet TI. is well borne, Diet III. may be 
given. This consists in adding cooked or raw Ixc!" to I >iet 1. 
Leube gives the following method of preparing feel-teak and 
believes that beef cooked in this way is very easily dig( -ted : 
The meat should be ke})t for sojne time, and i- then -crajx-d 
Avith a dull spoon; in this way a })nl]) is obtained, consisting 
only of the delicate ])arts of the nuiscle, and not containing anv 
of the tough, hard, and sinewy })()rtion. This pul]) is i-oa-tcd 
in fresh butter. l\aw ham is also to be recommended. In 
•addition to meat a small (piantity of mashe(l potatoes may be 
given, some stale wheat bread, and small amounts of collee or 
tea with milk (cautiously). 

Diet I\\ — This list is so a.rranged that if the patient can 
digest the articles of food mentioned under this head for some 
time, he can then begin with his usually accu^tomed diet : lvoa>t 
chicken, roast pigeon, venison, ])artridge, I'oast-beef — medium 
to raw (particularly cold), veal (from the leg), pickerel, boiled 
shad, macaroni, bouillon with rice. Small (piantities of wine may 
be taken one to two hours before eating ; gravies are contraindi- 
cated. Young and finely cho])])ed spinach is allowal)le ; other 
vegetables, such as asparagus, may be tried cautiously, although 
Leube considers this a rather riskv procedure. After lhi< fourth 
diet the patients are allowed to take a more liberal diet, but the 
increase should be gradual. They should refrain iVom eating 
vegetables, salads, preserves, and fruits for sonu^ time ; and when 
they are resumed, a baked apple is the iirst of the.-e articles to 
be eaten. 

Beaumont's Table. — This shows the mean time of diges- 
tion of the diiferent articles of diet — natm-ally, in the -tomach, 
and artificially, in vials, on a water-bath. The pi'oportion of 
gastric juice to aliment in artificial digestion was generally calcu- 
lated at one ounce of the former to one dram of the latter, the 
bath being kept as close to the natural temperature — lUO'^ F. — 
as practicable, with frequent agitation.

^' The foregoing table was computed from all the experiments 
made upon St. Martin since 1825, taking the average from such 
as were generally ])erformed under the naturally healthy condi- 
tion of the stomach and with ordinary exercise.'^ 

The mean times of artificial chymification have been taken 
from such expcrimemts as were generally made with the pure 
gastric juice, or with such juice as was too slightly vitiated to 
impair its solvent effect in any essential degree. They exhibit 
the average, as near as practicable, for the digestion of one dram 
of alimentary matter in one ounce of gastric juice, or in about 
that proportion, taking the length of time the food and gastric 
juice were heated. Exceptions, however, must be made for the 
bone, oil, cream, and one or two other articles, which chymifv 
much slower and with more difficulty than the less concentrated 
aliments. Several experiments where the methods were the 
same and the results were similar have been omitted. 

Pfii/oldt has devised the f >ll()wing table giving the digesti- 
bilitv of food. He experimented on normal cases, achieving his 
results by means of the stomach-tul)e, by detemiining the 
progress of digestion and the exact tiiiie at which the stomach 
was entirely em])ty after eating a certain (juantity of a S})ecial 
food. The table^ shows the period of time it takes a given 
quantity of food to leave the stomach :

These tables of Penzoldt are valuable as a ba>is for the .-elec- 
tion of food in gastric distui-bances. In the-e ca-e- it i.- im- 
portant that the food be quickly dissolved in the ua.-ti'ie xcre- 
tion, that it be readily absorbed, that it be neither fennented 
nor decomposed while beino; digested or absorbed, ;ind thnt the 
entire process be attended with no discomibrt. It niii-t l)e 
borne in mind that the digestibility of fo(»d varie- widely with 
the individual taste, for no matter how digestible a i'mA may 
be, if it is unpalatable, it will not be digested pi-opi'ily. In 
general it may be said: First — that in ticute e«in<liti(»ns the 
food should be of such a character that the >toniaeli .-hould be 
spared as much work as possible ; second — in chronic di-tnrb- 
ances it is important to snp])ly suihcicTit (|iiantities oi' nourish- 
ment in an easilv diirestible form, so as to maintain the bodv- 



432 DIET IN DISEASE. 

weight so far as possible. In determining the quantity of food 
that is necessary during twenty-four hours the amount is esti- 
mated in calories of heat. As is well known, a human being 
at rest requires 35 calories ])er kilo of weight, whereas while 
he is performing light work he requires 40 calories. In order, 
therefore, to determine the exact amount of nourishment it is 
only necessary to know the weight of the individual. Inas- 
much as the proteins can be replaced in a measure by the car- 
bohydrates and fats, an interchange of any of these three food 
elements can be made according to the patient's condition. 
The following tables, taken from Konig,^ give the composition 
of different foods and the number of heat units they produce. 
AVben the weight of the person is known, it is an easy matter 
to determine whether the amount of nourishment given is suffi- 
cient to maintain the body-weight. 

It is well too to weigh every jiatient suffering with a stomach 
disorder when treatment is first inaugurated, and to repeat this 
from time to time in order to determine whether the patient is 
gaining or losing flesh. 

The diet must be considered from the standpoint of the gas- 
tric secretion ; there may exist, on the one hand, the condition 
of hyperchlorhydria and hypersecretion ; on the other, hypo- 
chlorhydria and anacidity. 

In cases of hyperchlorhydria an abundant protein diet is 
indicated, inasmuch as the excess of hydrochloric acid is neu- 
tralized by this class of foods. On the other hand, as Riegel 
points out, certain cases of hyperchlorhydria at times do better 
upon milk, bread, and amylaceous foods than on protein foods. 
Ordinarily the proteins that are best adapted for patients 
suffering from hy])erchlorhydria are the red meats and eggs, 
wliereas the carbohydrates must })e given in the most easily 
digestible form. 

In cases of hypochlorhydria there is a diminution of the 
gastric secretion ; consequently the protein foods are digested 
with difficulty, whereas the carbohydrates are more easily 
digested. In this condition, therefore, only very tender meats, 
preferably scraped, are to be given, whereas such easily digest- 
il)le vegetables as s])ina('h, asparagus, mashed ])otatoes, and 
farinaceous foods may be eaten in quite large quantities. In 
l)()th hyperchlorhydria and hyjiochlorhydria a reasonable 
amount of fat must be eaten, preferably in the form of good 
butter.

The diet in motor disturbances of the stomach, as in atony 
or in dilatation, depends greatly upon whether an excess or a 
deficiency of gastric juice is secreted ; if there is an increase, 
an excess in protein food gives the best results ; if, on the other 
hand, there is a diminution of this secretion, protein food must 
be given the patient in the most easily digestible form — e.g., 
as the albumoses and peptones. The carbohydrates and the 
lighter vegetables may be given in somewhat larger propor- 
tion. In both conditions the ingestion of fluids should be 
reduced as far as possible. 

Normally the a})petite is a fair indication of the number of 
calories of heat that may be required ; in (;onditions of gastric 
disorder, however, this is not the case ; these patients lo.se their 

' Meat of various kinds, finely chop{)ed, niw or fried in butter; cold or 
wamri, taken at meals. 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 437 

appetite, and consequently often take insufficient nutrition. In 
those instances in which tlie gastric disorder is somewhat pro- 
tracted and accompanied by great loss of weight, and in which 
the patient takes insufficient nourishment, it need only be 
borne in mind that such a patient, resting quietly in bed, 
requires only about one-sixth of the number of c^ilories neces- 
sary for a })atient who is not resting. This plan may, there- 
fore, be used with advantage in the treatment of many patients 
sufferino; from disorders of the stomach. 

Liquid Foods in Gastric Disorders. — In tliose cases in which 
it is necessary to spare the stomach as much work as possible 
milk is the food that is usually most easily borne. In order 
to supply a sufficient number of calories it must be taken in 
large quantities, frequently diluted with lime-water or barley- 
water in order to add to its digestibility, or flavored with 
coffee, tea, or cocoa to lend variety and add to its palata^bility. 
In those cases in w^hich milk is not well borne buttermilk, 
whey, kumiss, and kefir may serve as substitutes. Among the 
other forms of fluids that may be given are broths (chicken, 
beef, mutton), bouillon, beef-tea, and meat-juice. Of these, 
meat-juice is most nutritious. 

Gehdinous Forms of Food. — Gelatinous articles of f )od, as 
gelatin, calves' feet, etc., are easily digested and readily ab- 
sorbed. 

Meats. — The digestibility of meat can be increased by chop- 
ping, beating, grinding, scra])ing, etc. 

Eggs. — The digestibility of eggs de])ends upon their mode of 
preparation ; raw and soft-boiled eggs are usually the most 
easily digestible forms. 

Fish. — In regard to fish, those containing but little fat are to 
be recommended for patients suffering from gastric disturbances, 
such as shellfish, pike, trout, carp, and halibut. 

Carbohydrates. — The number of vegetables from which selec- 
tion may be made is large. The secretions from the mouth and 
intestines play an important role in the digestion of these sub- 
stances. They should be masticated thoroughly. In those 
cases in which there is danger of fermentation they should be 
given with caution. The best form in which to give amylaceous 
food is in the form of zwieback, toast, stale whe^it bread, tapioca 
flour, oatmeal, etc. Ebstein has highly recommended aleuronat 
flour, which contains about 80 per cent, of protein. 

Leguminous foods contain a considerable amount of protein. 



438 DIET IN DISEASE. 

much of which, however, is not absorbed. They are apt to 
give rise to considerable fermentation. Potatoes are best given 
mashed or baked. Cabbage contains much cellulose, and should 
be omitted from the diet of all patients suffering from stomach 
disorders. 

Fruits are of slight nutritive value, but give a relish to other 
foods and increase intestinal peristalsis. 

Fat is to be recommended because of its tendency to increase 
the weight of the patient, and also because of its high calorie 
value. Some observers claim, however, that it acts as an 
irritant to the stomach. It is true that many patients find that 
fat meat, greasy gravies, etc., give rise to indigestion and often 
to nausea and vomiting. Much depends, however, on the mode 
of preparation. A considerable amount of fat may be given in 
the form of fresh butter spread on wheat bread or toast. Cer- 
tain forms of chocolate contain quite a large percentage of fat, 
and on this account are very nutritious. Of these, Mehring's 
Vigor Chocolate is to be especially recommended. Olive oil 
has recently been recommended in the treatment of certain 
gastric disorders (see p. 140). 

Concerning the relative digestibility and nutritive value of 
various liquid and solid foods, the reader is referred to the sec- 
tion dealing with this subject. 

Special Factors bearing- on the Diet in Patients 
Suffering from Gastric Disturbances. — 1. Von Noorden ^ 
demonstrated the fact that the intestine will vicariously perform 
the work of the stomach in conditions in which the secretory 
function of the latter is lost. Thus, as has been shown by Ewald, 
Leube, and others, in cases of atrophy of the gastric mucous 
membrane in which there is no longer any gastric secretion the 
patient may maintain his weight, for the intestine assumes the 
digestive function normally carried on by the stomach. Ein- 
horn ^ has likewise demonstrated this fact in cases of achylia 
gastrica. The point to })e borne in mind is that even in cases 
in whicli the secretory action of tlie stomach is lost entirely, the 
intestine may assume this function of the stomach. 

2. In those cases in which it is necessary to spare the stom- 
ach, as when food can not ))e digested or is vomited, either pre- 
digested foods may be utilized or foods may be administered 
through channels other than the stomach. Among the artificial 
predigested preparations are the albumoses and peptones, Den-

Feeding, etc. 

r]. The following rules for eating siiould he carried out : 
(((^ Food should be thoroughly masticated ; this is especially im- 
portant in those cases in which thei'e are marked gastric distui'b- 
ances. J^iernacki ' and the authors" have; shown the impor- 
tance of the effect of the salivary digestion upon the gastric; 
secretion in so far that an absence of salivary secrcition not 
only results in an absence of amyh)lysis, but that the ])rote- 
olysis is much retarded. 

(6) The meals should be taken at regular intervals and in 
moderate quantities, according to the nature of the gastric dis- 
ease ; this rule must be varied under certain conditions; c f/., 
small frequent meals should be taken in atony, whereas under 
other conditions, such as hyperchlorhydria, somewhat hu-ger 
meals should be given but three times daily. 

(c) The temperature of the food is also an important factor 
in the treatment of gastric disturbances; as Uffelmann has ])ointed 
out, the food should be taken at a temperature between 1)8° and 
100° F. The ingestion of very hot food is believed to ho a 
frequent cause of ulcer of the stomach. On the other hand, 
Wegele attributes the dyspepsia of many Americans to the 
taking of ice-cold water and other drinks. 

(d) The question of rest or exercise after eating is one that 
is of considerable importance to those suffering from gastric dis- 
turbances. It is generally admitted that violent exercise should 
not be indulged in after eating. According to Schule,'^ patients 
suffering from superacid! ty should not slee]> after eating. From 
experiments the; authors have determined : 

(1) Under normal conditions the secretory as well as the 
motor functions of the stomach are not interfered with during 
rest; during sleep after a meal, however, the secretory function 
remains normal, but the motor function is slightly disturbed. 

(2) In eases of liyperchlorhydria with normal motor function 
the acidity is reduced and the motor function remains normal 
while resting, whereas during sleep the acidity remains about 
the same and the motor function is impaired.

(3) In conditions of hyperchlorhydria with motor insufficiency 
the acidity is lessened and the motor function impaired during 
rest, whereas during sleep the acidity is stilh further decreased 
and the motor function still further impaired. 

(4j In conditions of hypochlorhydria with normal motor 
activity the acidity seems to be increased and the motor function 
remains normal during rest, whereas during sleep the acidity is 
increased and the motor function is disturbed. 

(5) In conditions of hypochlorhydria with diminislied motor 
activity the acidity seems to be increased and the motor func- 
tion improved during rest, whereas during sleep the acidity re- 
mains about the same and the motor function is interfered with. 

From these observations it appears that in conditions of gas- 
tric disturbances accompanied by hyperchlorhydria and hypo- 
chlorhydria and in motor disturbances of the stomach the 
gastric digestion is improved during rest, but impaired by sleep, 
after meals. 

SPECIAL CURES IN THE TREATMENT OF THE DISEASES OF 
THE STOMACH. 

Among the special forms of traitment recommended in gas- 
tric disturbances may be mentioned the rest cure, the milk cure, 
the grape cure, and forced feeding or gavage 

The rest cure, first devised by Weir Mitchell and subse- 
quently especially developed by Burkhart, in Germany, for the 
treatment of gastric conditions, plays an important role in the 
treatment of stomach disorders. This treatment is especially 
useful in cases of neurasthenia with severe anorexia and emaci- 
ation. It is also useful in the treatment of ulcer, gastritis, 
atony, and gastroptosis. 

The rest treatment in gastric disorders sliould be carried out 
for from six to eight weeks. The results that follow this plan of 
treatment are often marvellous. The patient should be con- 
fined to bed a large part of this time and given a varied diet, 
food being supplied every two to three hours. Boas advises 
that instead of the large (piaiitities of milk usually ])rescribe(l, 
the patient will do better if given ?, to 1 liter of cream daily 
in portions of 150 to 200 c.c. In addition to the protein food 
he advises a diet rich in carbohydrates and fats. In case of 
ccmstipation, milk-sugar, honey, marmalade, buttermilk, sour 
milk, kefir, or yoghurt may be added to the dietary to ad- 
vantage. 



DIET IN DISEASES OE THE STOMACH. 441 

Boas' diet list is as follows : 

7 a. m. : 4 liter viiror cliocolute in creani. 

8 to 4 zwieback (2 rolls), 20 to 'M) ^rni. l-uttc!-. 
10.30 A. M. : Cold or warm meat, e<,'ss, e<,'^' foods, w I icat hnail (j)erli:ips (tialiani 
bread), 20 gm. butter. 
150 gm. cream. 
Preserves or stewed fiuit. 
11 A. M. : J liter of soup. 

Potatoes or other vegetables in puree form. 
Meat and fish. 
Salad. 

Stewed fruit (sweet) or raw fruit. 
Cider, grape juice, or lemon albumin. 
4.30 P. M. : Coflee or tea with cream (loOgm.), zweiback, ( ra. k. r-, (iiabam 
bread, butter (20 gm.), or honey. 

8 P. M. : Eggs or egf; foods. 

Wheat bread, Graham bread, butter (.'10 gm. ). 
Stewed fruit. 

Two glasses of fruit wine or one bottle of maU beer. 
9.30 p. M. : 200 gm. cream with two to three crackers or zwiebac k witb buttir. 

For a further consideration of the method and ])lan of con- 
ducting the rest treatment systematically the reader is referred 
to the section dealing with this subject. 

The Milk Cure.— The underlying princii)le of the milk 
cure consists in the ingestion of large quantities of milk, either 
alone or together with other foods. Under normal conditions, 
when taken alone in large quantities — say three liters a day — 
milk does not suffice as a food ; in certain digestive di-nirb- 
ances, how^ever, milk given alone f^r a time forms a u.-eiui f >od 
and allows tlie stomach to regain its normal tone and fimcti< >ns. 
Milk is especially useful in the treatment of ulcer of the stom- 
ach and in certain forms of chronic gastritis ; it is ])articidarly 
useful in the secondary forms of gastritis, as those depending 
upon tuberculosis, anemia, etc. In some cases of nervous tlys- 
pepsia milk cures sometimes elfect remarkable residts, whereas 
in others milk disagrees and, as a consecjuence, ilie milk cure 
can not be undertaken. When there is a dimimition or an ab- 
sence of acid in the stomach, milk is usually not well l)(»rne. 
It is also contraindicated in severe cases of atony and of dilata- 
tion, in intestinal conditions accompanied by extreme ilatulence 
and chronic diarrhetis. 

When milk is given in large quantities in tuldition to other 
foods, it is more frequently better borne and is less tipt to dis- 
agree. One of the disadvantages of the milk ciu-e is the o])sti- 
nate constipation the milk is apt to induce. Milk can often be 
rendered more digestible by the addition of barley-water, 
lime-water, milk of magnesia, and the like, or small quantities 
of coffee, tea, or whiskv mav be added to it. When milk dis- 



442 DIET IN DISEASE. 

agreCvS, cream, buttermilk, kefir, kumiss, or matzoon may be given 
as a substitute for it. (See Milk Cure.) 

Forced Feeding- or Gavage. — This method was fiirst 
introduced by Debove, and consists in introducing milk, eggs, 
and meat-extracts into the stomach by means of the stomach- 
tube. It is especially useful in nervous anorexia, in which cases 
there is great danger of starvation from lack of nourishment. 

The Grape Cure. — In this form of treatment the patient 
lives exclusively u])on grapes; it is especially useful in plethoric 
individuals, in whom it is important to diminish the weight ; 
in chlorotic girls suffering with dyspepsia, and in certain cases 
of nervous dyspepsia. 

DIET IN DYSPHAGIA, 
Dysphagia may be due to any obstruction in the mouth, 
pharynx, or esophagus. The difficulty and pain induced by 
swallowing must be obviated by lessening the efforts at deglu- 
tition as much as possible ; for this reason food nuist be given 
in a concentrated form, and only in a liquid or semisolid state ; 
milk, egg-albumin, and the concentrated liquid beef prepara- 
tions are especially useful in this condition. In those cases in 
which food can not be swallowed in sufficient quantities the 
])atient must be fed through the stomach-tube. In this way 
broths, gruel, milk, and the like can be passed into the stomach. 
In very aggra^'ated cases gastrotomy must be performed to 
])revent starvation. 

DIET IN ACUTE GASTRITIS. 
Oser has said that ^' every case of acute catarrh of the 
stomach has a natural tendency to heal of its own accord unless 
a chronic form is })roduced by a mistaken diet or wrong medica- 
tion. '^ It is a generally adnn'tted fact that in the treatnuMit of 
this condition the diet ])lays the leading role. The first step in 
the treatment consists in securing absolute rest for the stomach 
and a total abstinence from food for at least twenty-four hours. 
This procedure is sometimes very difficult to carry out, for 
many patients })elieve that f xxl is necessary for tlu^m, and that 
thev can secure relief more (|uickly by taking nourishment. 
Tlu! nausea and vomiting which are ])resent in more oi- less 
degree in tliis (.'ondition, and which arc aggravated ])y the taking 
of food, will soon convince the ])atient of the necessity of ab- 
staining from f )()(1. Tlie thirst is, however, so severe in tliese 
cases that patients may l)e allowed to rinse the mouth with Avater 
fre(piently, to I'etain tiny bits of iee in the moutli, or even to

driuk very small quautitles of carbonated waters. M'ith this 
])lau of tVeatinent' recovery geiiei-ally follows in two oi' tlii-ee 
days. After tlie first twenty-lour hours feedinti' may he he^im 
by giving cantiously small (juantities of milk dihiled with lime- 
water, broths, and egg-albumin ; these can graduallv be in- 
creased in (quantity, and during the next dav or t\\(» boiled 
cliicken, sweetbreads, scraped beef, in addition to toa-t, may be 
added. 

The authors are accustomed to prescribe the ibllowing diet

444 DIET IN DISEASE. 

DIET IN CHRONIC GASTRITIS. 

The dietetic treatment of chronic gastritis is of far greater 
importance than the treatment of this disease by the use of 
drugs. The diet must he varied according to the stage of the 
disease. Inasmuch as the motor function of the stomach is 
usually unimpaired and only the secretory function affected, the 
mf>st easily borne forms of food are liquids, such as broths ; 
unfortunately, these foods do not furnish sufficient nutriment to 
sustain the patient. Their nutritive value may be increased by 
the addition of beef-extracts, eggs, barley and rice, peptones, 
somatose, etc. The diet should vary according to the character 
of the gastritis ; in those cases in which the gastric secretion 
has entirely or almost entirely disaj^peared, prc>tein food is 
digested Avith great difficulty ; it must, therefore, be given in 
the most digestible form ; of these foods, scraped beef, stewed 
beef, stewed chicken, broiled steak, and boiled sweetbreads are 
especially to be recommended. Vegetables should also be given 
in the most dio;estible form, best as a mush. ]\Iilk is useful in 
most cases ; occasionally, however, it is not well borne ; when 
this is the case, it can be made more agreeable by adding small 
quantities of rice, potatoes, or cocoa to it, or kefir, kumiss, or 
matzoon may be substituted for it. In those conditions in 
which considerable acid still remains in the stomach meats in 
various forms are very acceptable ; to tliis list may be added 
fish and eggs ; vegetables, such as mashed potatoes, spinach, 
mashed carrots, esj)ecially in the form of })urees, are to be 
recommended. In all instances fat should be given in an easily 
digestible form — as good butter, cocoanut-butter, or Mehring's 
Vigor Chocolate. It is impossible to formulate exact rules as 
to the number of meals that should be eaten and the quantity 
that should be taken at each meal ; in a general way, small fre- 
quent meals are best borne. Mineral waters are often useful in 
the treatment of chronic gastritis, and the saline waters and 
alkaline saline waters are especially to be recommended; of 
these, the waters of Kissingen, Ilomburg, Saratoga (Congress), 
Carlsbad, ]\Iarienl)ad, and Saratoga (Ilathorn) are especially 
noted for their usefulness in the treatment of chronic gastritis. 
Wjiter should be tid-cen in small (piautities between meals. Al- 
coholic stimulants or any strong stimulants should, as a rule, 
be omitted ; when utilized, tluy should l)e given in small quan- 
tities and best diluted with mineral waters. Salt and spices 
may be allowed oeeasionally in small (piantities.

The patient having been kept on this diet for a week or two, it 
must bo changed for one suitable to the milder forms of chronic 
gastritis. According to Einhorn, the diet should correspond as 
nearly as possible to the common mode of living. All foods 
derived from the vegetable kingdom should l)e given in large 
portions, while the quantity of meat should be limited. It is 
best rather to mention only those foods to be forbidden than 
to point out a few articles that can be taken. Forbid meat 
witli tough fibers, meat that contains too much fat, forbid saus- 
ages, lobster, salmon, chicken salad, mayonnaise, cucumbers, 
pickles, cabbage, strong alcoholic drinks.

DIET h\ DL'SEASKS OF THE STOMACIL 447 

DIET IN ATROPHIC CATARRH OF THE STOMACH. 

In conditions of atrojihy of the gastric* iniicoiis nH'nil)rano 
there is a complete absence of the gastric secretion. The con- 
dition has also been termed achylia gastrica bv Kinliorn. In 
this disease the intestine acts vicariouslv and digests the food 
for the stomach. It is im]K)rtant to arrange the diet so that it 
can easily be acted npon by the intestinal jnices. The food 
mnst be broken nj) into as fine particles as possil)le, and sliould 
to a large extent be given in licpiid and semill(juid form. Of 
the liquids, broths, such as barley, rice, or cliicken brolli, -dvc, 
to be recommended. 

Vegetables are usually well borne; cereals should be eaten 
after the cellulose has been removed. Peas and beans strained 
and eaten as a puree, as in broth, are especially useful, 
as they contain quite a large percentage of ])rotein. Potatoes 
and rice are to be eaten cooked with broth or milk, or as a mush. 
Eggs are to be taken soft-boiled. Meats must be given in the 
most digestible forms, as brains, scraped beef, boiled sweet- 
breads, and only in small amount ; raw oysters and boiled fish 
are also permissible. In very severe forms somatose and ]\Ios- 
quera Beef Meal are to be added to the milk or broth. ]\Iilk 
is occasionally imperfectly digested in this condition, and cream, 
kefir, kumiss, or matzoon may be substituted for it. i^utter 
may be eaten on crackers, stale bread, or toast. Such beverages 
as tea, coffee, cocoa, and small quantities of wine may be allowed. 

Small meals should be taken at intervals of two or three hours.

Eisner objects to the use of eggs in this disorder, as 
egg-albumin is digested with difficulty, inasmuch as it is 
not digested by trypsin. 



DIET IN HYPERSECRETION. 

By hypersecretion is meant a continuous excessive secre- 
tion of gastric juice ; the condition may be intermittent or 
chronic. 

In intermittent hypersecretion the excessive secretion 
occurs periodically and is accompanied by extreme distress. 
This distress may often be lessened if a small quantity of milk 
or a hard-boiled e^g is taken at the very beginning of an 
attack. Inasmuch as fluids in large quantities tend to increase 
the vomiting, their use should be prohibited.. If thirst is 
severe, small bits of ice may be given or rectal injections 
administered. The diet during the interval between attacks is 
similar to that prescribed in hyperchlorhydria {q. v.). 

Chronic Hypersecretion. — In this condition an excess- 
ive quantity of gastric juice is secreted continuously. In the 
treatment of this disorder all foods that tend to increase the 
s(*cretion of acid in the stomach, such as spices, condiments, 
and stimulants, are to be proscribed. The diet should be made 
up largely of the proteins, since these foods are generally well 
borne ; the carbohydrates are ])oorly digested, and hence must 
be given only in small quantities and in the most readily 
assimilable forms. Inasmuch as fats diminish the secretion of 
hydrochloric acid they may be used to advantage in hyper- 
secretion. Fluids should be administered sparingly. Food 
should be given at intervals of two or three hours. All 
forms of meats are allowable — chicken, roast beef, lamb chops, 
broiled steak ; of carbohydrates, the best are oatmeal, zwieback, 
and Xestle's food ; puree of potatoes, spinach, etc., may also be 
eaten. Milk is an excellent food in this disease, and may be 
taken either alone or mixed with tea, coflee, cocoa, or eggs. In 
aggravated forms of the disorder RIegel advises an exclusive 
milk diet for about eight days ; the milk producing a sedative 
effect upon the gastric mucous membranes, reducing the se- 
cretion of gastric juices. The same effect may be obtained 
at first by exclusive rental feeding for a period of six or 
eight days.

DIET IN DILATATION OF THE STOMACH. 

In the dietetic treatment of dilatation of the stomach it must 
l)e rememb(>red that fluids are badly borne, and must, therefore, 
be given only in very small (juantities- 
one-half liters a day. 
cream, coffee, tea, and 



-not over one to one and 
The fluids that are permissil)le are milk, 
l)()uillon, all in small (juantities. The 



thirst that accom})anics this disease may be relieved by allowing 
the ])atient to suck bits of ice or by giving rectal injections of 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. 451 

water or normal salt solution. Since nutrition is usually very 
faulty in this disease, nutrient eneniata must frecjuently l)e em- 
ployed. When milk is administered, such substances as tapioca 
and rice should be added. Egij,' or concentrated meat-extracts 
should be added to bouillon to inci-ease its nutritive value. 
Meats should be given only in tlie most digestible ibrms ; ol' 
these, stewed chicken, boiled sweetbreads, calves'-brains, and 
scraped beef are to be preferred. Vegetables, such as carrots, 
spinach, peas, potatoes, should be administered in the ibrni of 
purees. Bread should be eaten stale ; wheat bread or toast is 
best. Stewed fruits, such as stewed prunes and baked a})pU's, 
are also permissible. Since fats are apt to cause fermentation, 
butter should be allowed only in quite small (juantities. Alcohol 
is not to be i-ecommended in this condition; If It must be used, 
it is best given in the form of some light wine. Strong spices 
should always be avoided. The use of olive oil in the treat- 
ment of dilatation, as has been advocated l)y Cohenkeim, has 
already been described on page 140. 

The special feature of the treatment is small quantities of 
food, given frequently in a semifluid form. It Is unwise to 
prescribe an absolute dry diet, as was formerly advised in 
the treatment of this condition. Patients witli dilatation 
of the stomach should be cautioned against visiting watering 
places.

DIET IN ATONY OF THE STOMACH. 

Since atony is frequently caubed by injudicious and too rapid 
eating, persons witii feeble digestive powers should exercise 
especial caution to eat slowly, masticate thoroughly, and avoid 
indigestible food. Persons suffering from atonv of the stomach 
should eat small quantities of food at frequent intervals. Since 
water is not absorbed in the stomach to any extent, it is advis- 
able that the quantity of fluids taken should not exceed H liters 
a day ; this amount should include all fluids — coffee, tea, soups, 
etc. If the thirst is very great, enemata of water or nutrient 
enemata may be administered. 

The use of milk in large quantities, as has been recom- 
mended, is not generally to be advised when the patient is 
able to go about, since the weight of large quantities of milk 
may overdistend the stomach ; when, however, [i rest cure is insti- 



454 DIET IN DISEASE. 

tilted, milk is commonly well borne when taken in moderate 
quantities (250 c.c.) at frequent intervals. The diet in atony 
of the stomach varies according to the nature of the gastric 
secretion. In cases of superacidity a liberal meat diet, consist- 
ing especially of chicken, beef, mutton, or ham, is to be recom- 
mended ; fish, a^^^^^^y hard and soft boiled, are also permissible ; 
the vegetables should be selected with care ; carrots, peas, beans, 
and cauliflower may be given, but must be mashed and strained 
so as to rid them of cellulose ; potatoes, rice, and grits may also be 
allowed. Butter is the form of fat best suited to this condition. 
Alcoholic stimulants are, as a rule, not well borne, and their use 
should be ])rohibitcd ; in a limited number of cases alcohol in the 
form of a light wine acts as a stomachic, and may be prescribed. 
The following list has been used by the authors in the treat- 
ment of atony of the stomach :

In those (;ases in which there is au absence or a diminution of 
acid in the gastric secretion the lighter forms of meat, such as 
the white meat of (;hicken or lisli, sweetbreads, stewed chicken, 
or raw scrapcid beef, should be allowed ; vegetables, on the other, 
hand, must be given in somewhat larger (piantities. The treat- 
ment of the clin»ni(; constipation acc()m})anying gastric atony, 
since it is one of the most constant symptoms, re(piires special 
mention. In the treatment of tiiis c(jndition the main reliance 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. 455 

must be placed on tlie diet. Such fonns of foods should be 
given as will, in tlie course of diii^estiou, ])r()duce substances 
that excite intestinal peristalsis ; aniono^ these foods may be 
mentioned Graham bread, certain veii'ctables, such as carrots, 
beans, tomatoes, peas, and turnips, macaroni, stewed and raw 
fruits, buttermilk, honey, and cider. This form of diet will 
often overcome the consti])ation of atony without the aid of 
drugs. (For a more extensive consideration of the dietetic 
treatment of chronic constipation the reader is referred to the 
section dealing with this subject.)

DIET IN ULCER OF THE STOMACH. 

Prophylactlcally much can be done by a caix^fully selected 
diet to prevent the onset of an ulcer of the stomach. As soon 
as the very first symptoms become manifest, the })atient should 
be placeil upon an absolute milk diet. The temjx^rature of the 
food should be regulated, so that it be not given too hot or too 
cold. Anemia, which so frequently accompanies the disease, 
must be combated ; hyperchlorliydria, which is so important an 
etiologic factor in this condition, must also be overcome. 

Boas ^ divides the treatment of ulcer of the stomach into 
several stages : 

Stage of Ilemorrliage. — In this stiige Boas advises absolute 
rest in bed ; the patient not being even allowed to arise for pur- 
poses of defecation or urination. Xo nourishment whatever 
should be given by the mouth. In robust individuids even nutri- 
ent enemata may be omitted. If the patient is weak or iu feeble 
condition, feediug by the rectum may be instituted. (See the 
section on Nutrient Enemata for the method of ])rej)aration 
and utilization of this mode of feeding.) Only two or three 
nutrient enemata an; to be given daily. Boas carries out this 
plan for three or four days. A iter this he gradually begins 
moutli-feediug, the nourishment consisting exclusively of fluids 
diluted with lime-water, Avith tea, or with coffee. Jle begins 
usually with .'>()() gm. a day (20 gm. every hour), and, if pos- 
sible, increases 10(J gm. a day ; so that on the seventh day the 
patient consumes 1 liter; on the tenth, H to 2 liters; and on 
the fifteenth, 2.^, to ?> liters. A third cream may be added to 
the milk verv early in the treatment. In addition he ])ermits 
beef-tea, freshlv ex])ressed or artl(icl:il beef-juice, :ind egg-albu- 
min. Tli(! carbonated waters, such ;is Vichy, arc al,-o useful. 

^ JI(i(jciikraii/:h( it( II, j>. 107. 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. 457 

After the first week Boas begins the regular Leube and 
Ziemssen ulcer treatment, which he conducts as follows : The 
patient is given \ liter of Carlsbad water, which he drinks in 
bed morning and evening. Hot-water apj)lications are placed 
on the abdomen. The diet during tliis stage consists mainly 
of milk in addition to other fluids, as cream, egg-albumin, and 
even raw eggs. If the patient is very weak, nutrient enemata 
may occasionally be given. 

In the treatment, beginning with the third and continuing 
during the fourth week, Boas permits the })atient to recline on 
a couch, and continues the use of the Carlsbad water, wliich 
should be given for four Aveeks from iXxQ, time it is first 
taken ; he advises that the diet still consist mainly of milk, 
although he now permits the addition of soaked zwieback, 
scalded crackers, and soft rolls. Meats (sweetbreads, brains, 
meat balls), fish (perch, oysters in small quantities), in addi- 
tion to the light red wine and carbonated waters, are also 
allowed. 

After the fourth week, if the patient is doing well. Boas adds 
from 50 to 200 gm. of mashed potatoes, stewed fruits, and 
vegetables, such as spinach, carrots, peas, and turnips, in the 
form of purees, to the diet previously given. The meats — 
broiled steak, chops, and roast beef — if well cooked, can finally 
be given more liberally. According to Boas, the patient should 
avoid raw fruit, acid and highly seasoned foods, and also very 
hot and very cold drinks, for many years. Even in those 
cases in which there has been no hemorrhage Boas nevertheless 
advises the rest treatment. It is generally admitted that the 
rest cure is the only satisfactory plan for treating cases of ulcer 
of the stomach. Leube and Penzoldt have devised dietaries 
for these cases ; these have been given elsewhere (see p. 430). 
The first dietary should be followed for ten days ; the second, 
for the succeeding ten days ; the third, for about eight days. 
The severity of the condition in each case must, of course, 
determine the length of time during which each dietary must 
be continued. In all instances milk seems to be the most useful 
form of food during the first weeks of this west treatment. 
This plan w^as carried out many years ago by Cruveilhier in 
his treatment of ulcer of the stomach. Occasionally milk does 
not agree, and substitutes must be given in its stead. Of 
these, buttermilk, kefir, matzoon, koumiss, or yoghurt are espe- 
cially to be recommended. In order to increase the food-

Among other preparations that have been found useful as 
foods are the well-known Leube-Ivosenthal beef solution, as 
recommended by Leube and Rosenthal, and chicken and calves'- 
foot jelly, as advised by Fleiner. 

In those cases in w^hich milk is not well borne Debove sug- 
gests that the milk be ])assed into the stomach through the 
stomach-tube. He found that when given in this way the nnlk 
was not vomited. Bouveret also recommends this mode of 
feeding in intractable cases of ulcer. 

There are a number of cases of ulcer of the stomach that do 
not yield to the ordinary rest treatment as outlined by Boas, 
Leube, and Penzoldt. Donkin ^ first directed attention to the 
fact that excellent results could l)e obtained in this class of 
cases by exclusive rectal alimentation. Mis treatment extended 
over twenty-three days; since then McCall Anderson- and 
Boas"^ hav(? obtained excellent results by this plan of treat- 
ment in obstinate and recurrent cases of ulcer of the stomacli ; 
Riegel, too, apj)roves of this })lan. Boas carries out exclusive 
rectal alimentation for at k^ast ten days; he then allows fluids, 
such as milk, tea, bouihon, red wine, for some days, and finally 
])ermits i\\v. patient to r(\<ume liis usual diet. We have f )und, 
in administering nutrient eneniata in this condition, that fir 
better results are obtained when tlie enemata ai'c given by 
the continuous-drop method of Murj)hy at the rate of about 
GO dro])s \M)Y hour or less. They are I'ar better n'tained, and

o^ive rise to less irritation to tlie rectum. Most j)atients can 
retain several (|uarts of milk a day with four to six raw eggs 
without ditticulty, ])roviding the milk and eggs are ke[)t 
warm so as not to coagulate in the tube. When the patient 
is greatly reduced in strengtli, the caloric value of the nutrient 
enema may be enhanced by the addition of 1 to '1 drams of 
grape-sugar. 

There are a certain number of light forms of ulcer of the 
stomach in which it is im})ossible to carry out the rest treat- 
ment. In such cases, at times, Boas advises an ambulatory 
treatment, together with the use of silver nitrate. The silver is 
administered in solution on an empty stomach in from J- to ^- 
grain doses ; at the same time a carefully regulated diet is 
given. The food consists chiefly of milk and other fluids ; in 
addition he allows tender meats and fish, mashed potatoes, and 
vegetables in the form of purees (cautiously), all in moderate 
quantities. 

Cohnheim advises the use of olive oil in the treatment of 
gastric ulcer, and claims that cases of ulcer associated with or 
without hyperchlorhydria are quickly cured by means of the 
oil treatment or by an emulsion of sweet almonds. Bloch has 
also reported great benefit from small doses of oil. The oil is 
given before meals, beginning with a few spoonsful and increas- 
ing to a wineglassful or more before each meal. If disgust is 
produced by the oil, its use must be abandoned, or the oil of 
sweet almonds may be utilized in its stead. With this sweet 
oil the associated treatment, such as diet, rest, etc., must be 
carried out. 

Mineral waters are often utilized in the treatment of ulcer 
of the stomach ; of these, Carlsbad waters have been especially 
recommended, but Saratoga (Hathorn) can also be used with 
benefit. The mineral water treatment should be undertaken 
only at the spring, after the ulcer has healed, and after the 
patient has undergone the rest cure. The treatment at Carlsbad 
or Saratoga will often prevent the possibility of relapses. After 
the ulcer has healed, it is important to overcome the anemia 
which is usually present in most cases of gastric ulcer. This 
may be accomplished by means of the diet (see Diet in Anemia) 
as well as by sending the patient to some invigorating watering- 
place or to the mountains. Iron and arsenic should also be 
given to overcome this condition. They should not, however, 
be prescribed until the ulcer is healed.

Lenhartz^ recently cautions against the strict abstinence diet 
in the treatment of ulcer of the stomach, even in those instances 
in which there is hemorrhage. He bases his conclusions on 
the fact that since ulcer of the stomach is most frequently 
accompanied by superacidity and also by an enfeebled condi- 
tion, it is best to give protein food early to overcome the acidity 
as well as to build up the system. The accompanying table 
illustrates his method of feeding :

In the Lenhartz cure, absolute rest in bed for at least four 
Aveeks is maintained. An ice-bag is placed on the abdomen, 
and left on more or less continually for two weeks. On the 
first day, even though there be hematemesis, 200 c.e. of iced 
milk are given in teaspoonful doses together with two raw, ice- 
cold, beaten up q^^^. Bismuth is given at the same time two 
or three times daily in single doses of 2 grams, and continued 
for ten days. The eggs are beaten up with sugar, and they are 
kept cold by placing the cup containing them in a dish filled 
with ice. The milk is increased every day by 100 grams, and 
one additional Qg^ added ; on the ninth day the patient is given.

It is best in all cases of ulcer, when possible, to institute the 
Lenhartz treatment rather than the Leube cure, for a restriction 
to a liquid diet is often unnecessary, quite distressing to the 
patient, and leads to great loss of Hesh, weakness, and anemia. 
This treatment is especially useful in cases accompanied by hem- 
orrhage. Quite satisfactory results are, however, often obtained 
by the Leube treatment, and at times, on account of the severe 
nausea, vomituig, and pain, one is forced to follow this form of 
treatment. 

According to our observation of 521 cases of ulcer treated 
by tlie rest cure, of which 404 underwent the Leube treatment 
and 117 the Lenhartz treatment, 72 per cent, recovered by the 
Leube cure and QQ per cent, by the Lenhartz. This is in com- 
parison from 40 to 50 per cent, of cures of cases treated as 
ambulatory cases, and 71 per cent, treated surgically. It is 
evident that when an ulcer })atieut is treated medically he should 
be thoroughly treated, and ambulatory treatment should, if pos- 
sible, not be instituted. We also maintain the belief that many 
ulcer cases do not recover because the treatment is not suf- 
ficiently prolonged, and in some cases the rest cure should be 
extended to six or even eight weeks. 

Einhorn's method of duodenal alimentation already described 
is a most useful and feasible method of feeding in severe forms 
of gastric ulcer, not yielding to other forms of treatment. By 
means of this method it is possible to nourish the individual 
without great loss of flesh. 

Einhorn uses as a nutritive medium a mixture of 200 
to 240 c.c. of milk, 1 egg, 15 to 30 gm. of lactose every 
two hours. At times he adds cream to increase the caloric 
value. 

In some cases his diet for duodenal feeding consists of —

GASTRIC HEMORRHAGE. 

As soon as homorrhaue from the stoniacli occurs, the patient 
should be put to bed and not aUowed to rise, even for purposes 
of defecating or urinating. A light ice-bag should be placed 
over the region of the stomach, and no food or drink whatever 
should be allowed ; in order to quench tlie thirst small quan- 
tities of ice may be given the patient to suck. Nourishment 
must be entirely by the rectum ; but even this is usually 
unnecessary for the first few days. In oi'der to combat the 
weakness following great loss of blood salt solutions may be 
injected into the rectum, or if the ])atient is very weak, coffee, 
meat-juice, or whisky may be added to the enema. In very 
grave cases salt infusions must be resorted to, administered by 
subcutaneous or intravenous injections. 

The salt solution enema is often best given in the form of a 
prolonged instillation by the drop metliod. After a few days 
nourishment miiy be given by means of nutrient enemata, or by 
the continuous feeding per rectum by the drop method. 

Bourget has advised his iron chlorid gelatin in cases of gas- 
tric hemorrhages. This mixture is prepared as follows: 100 
grams of gelatin are dissolved by moderate heat in 100 grams 
of glycerin and lOO grams of water ; when thoroughly li(|uefied, 
50 grams of tincture of chlorid of iron is (juickly added. A 
precipitate is formed by coagulation, the entire mass is heated 
gradually, and stirred until it is homogeneous ; it is then allowed 
to run over metal ])lates divided into small scpiares of one cen- 
timeter. Two or three tablets are taken several hours after 
me;ds. Bourget orders the following diet in gastric hemorrhage : 

Milk and rolls. 

Chlorid of iron gelatin taltlets. 

100 to 150 c.c. of I>oiirget's alkaline water (S gm. sodium 
bicarbonate, 4 gni. sodium phosphate, and 2 gm. sodium sul- 
phate in each liter i. 
Milk with rice. 

Chlorid of iron gelatin tablets. 
8.20 to 1 V. M. : loO cc. alkaline water. 
(') p. M. : Milk and rice. 
V. M. : Chlorid of iron gelatin tablets. 
10 p. M. : lOO-loO c.c. alkaline water. 

In some hemorrhages Bourget admini>ters the gelatin oidy 
after lavage of the stomach with a 1 jx-r cent, chlorid of iron 
solution. The residts following the treatment are UKjst favorable. 

Hot-water enemata have also been emj)loyed lor the control 
of gastric and duodenal hemorrhage. A ])int of water at a tem- 
perature of 120° Y. is administered three times daily ; this is

said to cause a reflex anemia in tlie upper intestine, and this 
acts favorably on the heinorrhaox!. 

Gelatin is also employed with favorable results in this con- 
dition ; it is best administered subeutaneously ; it must l)e sterile 
(such as is furnished by Merck in sealed ^lass tubes), and injected 
under strict antiseptic precautions. The irelatin may also be 
used as an enema in 1 to 2 per cent, solutions, or it may be 
taken internally, a tablespoonful of a 10 per cent, solution 
being given every three hours. 

After the cessation of the hemorrhage for a few days feeding 
bv mouth may be instituted, beginning with small amounts of 
milk and gradually increasing in quantity. 

DIET IN CARCINOMA OF THE STOMACH. 

Boas divides the treatment of cancer of the stomach into the 
treatment of cancer of the cardiac portion of the stomach and 
that of the body of the stomach. 

In the treatment of cancer of the cardiac portion of 
the stomach the diet should be such as will prevent, so far 
as possible, any irritation of the diseased and stenosed esophagus 
and stomach. Solids should, therefore, be avoided. Milk is 
the food that is usually best borne in this disease. It can be 
rendered more Jiutritious by the addition of somatose, Nestle's 
food, eggs, and the like. Besides this, broths of all kinds, 
cocoa, milk with tea or coffee, or buttermilk may be given. 
Mehring's Vigor Chocolate is useful for supplying fat. 

As soon as difficulty arises in swallowing liquids, gastrot- 
omy should be performed, in order to supply the nourishment 
which it is impossible to pass in through the esophagus. If 
this procedure is deemed inadvisable, nutrient enemata may be 
resorted to. 

In the dietetic treatment of cancer of the body of the 
stomach milk likewise forms the most important article of 
diet. The more ensily digestible forms of meat, such as sweet- 
breads, scraped beef, brains, and stewed chicken, are permis- 
sible. In this disease there is usually a distaste for meat, and 
fish may be substituted for it; of these, t)oile<l mackerel, rock, 
haddock, or trout are to be recommended. Of the vegetables, 
mashed potatoes, S})inach, carrots, peas, l)eans, cauliflower, 
if mashed and strained so as to rid them of cellulose, are 
admissible ; rice, farina, and cornstarch with milk are also 
valuable forms of food. 



468 



DIET IN DISEASE. 



In cases of cancer of the stomach too abundant a diet should 
not be insisted upon, as at best but little can be gained by this 
method of treatment. 

Milk with tea, coffee or cocoa, or wine or whisky, may be 
given for the thirst. The food value of these liquids may be 
increased by the addition of preparations such as somatose, 
nutrose, etc. Fluids should, however, be taken in small quan- 
tities at a time. In order to supply the necessary quantity 
of fat, butter or ^^ehring^s Vigor Chocolate is to be recom- 
mended. In these cases it is often ini})()rtant to promote the 
general nutrition by means of rectal alimentation. The taste of 
the ])atient should be consulted in prescribing tlie diet in this 
disease, and various delicacies to tempt the appetite should be 
served, care being taken to avoid monotony in food and en- 
deavoring to overcome the distaste for it. It is possible often 
by careful attention to the diet to maintain a good state of nu- 
trition in these patients for a considerable period of time.

470 IMET IN DISEASE. 

DIET IN GASTROPTOSIS AND ENTEROPTOSIS. 

While the treatment of gastroptosis and enteroptosis is mainly 
mechanical, — requiring the use of well-fitting abdominal band- 
ages, massage, and electricity, — much can be accomplished by 
proper care in the diet. Remarkable results are frequently 
obtained from rest cures, the patient being compelled to remain 
in the recumbent position for a long period of time and to take 
large quantities of food. This form of treatment, resorting at 
times to forced feeding or a food cure, is especially necessary in in- 
dividuals who have become greatly emaciated. Patients afflicted 
with these conditions should lie down after eating. The diet 
should be very nourishing, and should contain somewhat large 
proportions of fatty foods. Milk is an excellent food in many 
cases, and, where it is well borne, cream may be added to it to 
increase its caloric value, and may be taken in large quantities. 
AYhen milk is not well borne, solid foods nuist be administered. 
Of these, all forms of digestible meats can usually be allowed, 
such as chicken, roast-beef, broiled steak, and lanib-ch(^j)s ; fish of 
various kinds and digestible vegetables are also permissible ; of 
the vegetables especially to be recommended are spinach, car- 
rots, asparagus, and caulifiower; of the fits, butter, cream, and 
Mehring's Vigor Chocolate are particularly useful. 

In order to overcome the severe constipation accompanying 
these conditions, foods that excite intestinal peristalsis are es])e- 
ciallv to be recommended ; among these may be mentioned 
cider, buttermilk, grape-juice, fruits, and honey. The object 
of th(! so-called f )r('ed feeding or food cure is to increase tiie 
body-weight until it corresponds with the weight of the indi- 
vidual in healtli. j^oas advises that the })ati('nt l)e ke})t in bed 
for four to five weeks, a varied diet being insisted on, and nour- 
ishment supplied every two hours. Boas believes that better 
results are obtaine<l if in-tead of administering large quantities 
of milk, cream (from I to 1 liter daily) be given in quantities 
of from loO to 200 c.c. 

Strauss reports favorable results from the fiJhnving alimen- 
tation as a food cure in enteroptotic and neurasthenic })atients : 

I>re;ikfast : Flour soup rich in l)ntt('r, porridiro, cocoa with iiiilk-anii-c!-e;im

DIET IN NERVOUS GASTRIC DISORDERS. 

Nervous Anorexia. — In this condition it is important to 
isolate the patient from his family. Milk, in gradually increas- 
ing quantities, and, if pdssihle, other foods, should he given. 
If the ])atient does not take sufficient nourishment, nutrient 
enemata should be administered, or the patient may be fed by 
means of the stomach-tube. The food should be given in as 
concentrated and nutritious a form as possible ; for this purpose 
eggs are suitable. Somatose should be added to the milk. 
Frequently cases of anorexia are completely cured by a wvW- 
regulated rest cure of from six to ten weeks' duration. Excel- 
lent results are obtained bv duodenal feedinir. 



472 DIET IN DISEASE. 

Nervous Vomiting. — This is often overcome merely by 
isolation and change of scene. In severe cases patients should 
be placed in bed ; they are best fed on semisolid or liquid 
food, since the latter is more easily retained than solid food. 
It should be given in very small quantities ; scraped beef, eggs, 
rice, and toast are especially useful. Cracked ice will often 
aiford relief. The most indigestible forms of foods are fre- 
quently well borne when the most digestible are speedily 
vomited. In severe cases the patient should be fed for some 
days exclusively by rectal alimentation or duodenal feeding 
should be practised. The most gratifying results are obtained 
by means of the last-mentioned form of treatment. 

Nervous Subacidity and Anacidity. — The food should 
be given in small quantities and frequently. Tlie diet need not 
be limited to carbohydrate food, but should l)e a mixed one, 
since the intestine takes uj) the work of the stomach in digesting 
the protein food. A more extensive description of the diet to be 
used will be found in the section on the Diet in Achylia Gastrica. 

Diet in Nervous Dyspepsia. — In this condition the diet 
should not be too restricted. Strengthening food, without any 
attempt at a too rigorous diet, should be prescribed. Tlie pa- 
tient must be impressed with the idea of tlie importance of con- 
suming as much food as possible. In those cases in which milk 
is well tolerated it should be given in large quantities ; when it 
is not well borne, buttermilk, kefir, or koumiss may be substi- 
tuted for it. The patient's appetite should be humored, and he 
should be allowed to eat any food he can digest. Alcoholic 
stimulants should be prohibited, or given only in very small 
quantities. In severe cases a well-conducted rest cure will pro- 
duce the best results ; but often change of scene, relief from 
cares, or exercise in the open air will bring about a cure.

474 INFANT FEEDING. 

DIET IN HYPERCHLORHYDRIA OR HYPERACIDITY. 

By the term hyperclilorhydria is meant an increase in the 
secn-etion of muriatic acid in the stomach. In the treatment of 
this condition the main object is to prevent this increase in 
acid ; this is best accomplislied by regulation of the diet. All 
irritating; fluids, such as acids, including organic acids, as acetic 
(vinegar), citric, and tartaric acids, s})ices or condiments (pep- 
])er, mustard, vinegar), should be avoided, and the use of all 
strong alcoholic beverages and of hard substances, which are 
apt to irritate the stomach, such as nuts, should be interdicted. 
Food nuist be tlioroughly masticated, and should be taken 
neither too cold nor too hot. The class of foods that seem to 
be best suited are the proteins, since they combine with and, 
therefore, neutralize the excess of acid ; for this reason foods 
containing an abundance of protein, such as (iii:g!^, meat, and 
fisli, may be given quite freely. The large amount of extractives 
in meat stimulate the flow of gastric juice, and, tlierefore, meat 
should be allowed only when well cooked, so as to remove the 
extractives. For tlie same reason raw beef and beef-juice should 
be avoided in this condition. Carbohydrates should be admin- 
istered in small quantities and in the most digestil)le forms.

llci-cher has inv(;stigatcd the su])ject of the coml)iniug 
effect of muriatic acid with various foods ; he discovered 
that beef, veal, ham, and mutton bind twice as nnich nui- 
riatie acid as do calves' brains and sweet])reads ; the first- 
named class of meats are, therefore, most suitable in conditions 
of hyperchlorhvdria. Inasnuieh as uncooked meats tend to 
excite the; flow of the gastric juice, they should not be taken in

this condition ; when meat, liowevcr, is well cookod it may he 
j)rescribed to advantage in conditions of liypcrchlorhych-ia. In 
addition, Fk'isclier mentions the following- artick's of foods cap- 
able of binding large (jnantilies of nnnaatic acid : pork, chee^e, 
sansage, ham, Graham bread, milk, and cocoa. h'arinaccons 
foods are not well tolerated in this condition, and mnst l)c given 
either in a very digestible form or, best, combined with ])rotein 
food. Only the more digestible vegetables are to be allowed, 
such as mashed potatoes, spinach, asparagus, peas, and carrots, 
strained and eaten in the form of purees. 1^'als tend to lessen 
the acidity of the gastric secretion, and are, therefore, to be rec- 
onmiended ; they are best given in the form of butter, cream, 
olive oil, and the like. Of the fluids, alkaline mineral waters, 
such as A])ollinaris, Vichy, and Seltzer, are especaally useful ; 
the carbon dioxid contained in these waters prochices a sedative 
eiFect and lessens the secretion of acids. These waters may be 
used to dilute milk or wine. The following table, taken from 
Fleischer, shows the ability of various foods to combine with 
muriatic acid :

476 DIET IN DISEASE. 

In arranging the diet for patients with hyperchlorhydria it has 
been found best in the authors' experience, in dealing with pa- 
tients taking but little nourishment, to allow them to eat at 
frequent intervals ; if, however, large meals are consumed, it is 
advisable to permit only three meals a day, allowing the stomach 
to rest during the intervals. 

In marked forms of nervous hyperchlorhydria a purely vege- 
table or milk and vegetable diet has been recommended l)y 
certain writers ; the vegetables should be eaten in the form of 
purees. 

Laufer, Vincent, Enriquez, and others attach great import- 
ance to a salt-free diet in hyperchlorhydria, believing that a high 
percentage of muriatic acid may be reduced by a diet free of 
salt. Zweig comes to similar conclusions, and urges a salt-free 
diet in the treatment of gastric hyperacidity. (See Salt-free 
Diet.) 

The following tables, taken from Zweig, indicate the per- 
centage of salt found in some forms of uncooked and 
cooked food :

DIET IN INTESTINAL DISEASES. 

The diet plays quite as important a role in tlie treatment of 
diseases of the intestine as it docs in the treatment of gastric 
disorders. In many intestinal disturbances, such as acute in- 
testinal catiirrh, diarrhea, etc., cures can often be eifected by 
diet alone, when without this mode of treatment the disease 
might become intractable. The diet in intestinal di.seases, as 
in gastric disorders, must be such as will produce no annoying 
symptoms. The process of digestion in the int(^stin(' is ex- 
ceedingly complicated, and therefore the digestibility of foods 
in this part of the alimentary tract is m<^st diihcuh to deter- 
mine. This subject was studied by Riibner,^ who determined 
tlie degree of absorption of various foods in the intestine. The 
table on page 480 gives his results. 

It is thus shown that certain forms of foods contain very large 
proportions of protein matter, but that their absorbability is so 
slight that their nutritive value is far lower than that of foods 
containing less protein. Thus, while peas contain considera- 
bly more protein (7 per cent.) than does milk (3.7 per cent.), a 
much smaller proportion of ])rotein is absorbed in the case of 
the former than in tliat of the latter ; on the other hand, the 
absorbability depends greatly on the mode of pre]>aration of 
the food ; when vegetables are mashed and then strained so as 
to rid them of their cellulose envelopes, they are much more

readily absorbed tbau when eaten with the cellulose. Tiie 
dio-estibility of certain foods in the intestine varies greatly with 
ditferent individuals. For this reason exact rules cannot be 
formulated in any case, but the diet nnist be varied according 
to individual peculiarities. Boas ^ has expressed his opinion 
on this subject as follows : 

"1. In a number of intestinal di.-eases a change of diet is 
unnecessary or may even be harmful. 

'^ 2. In some cases special dietetic restrictions are directly 
indicated, but these should be as few as ])os-ible. 

" o. In another series of cases an abundant, heavy, not 
easily digestible or absorbal)le diet is indicated. 

"4. The general aim of our treatment should always be to 
so manage the case bef )re us that digestion of a normal diet 
will always occur in tlic alimentary canal without any subjec- 
tive or o])jective (listurl)anc('S. Under these circumstances only 
can the case; be considered cured." 

According to their elfect on inte.-tinal ])eristalsis, foods may 
1)(^ divided into three classes : those inducing constipation ; 
tho<e producing a laxative ell'eet, and those exerting no especial 
effect in either direction. In the first class are those fo(Mls 
containing an asti'Inofent, such as tannin ; among tlie<e may be 
mentioned ceilain I'ed wines, cocoa, and t<'a. iviee, tapioai, 
barl(;y, sa^o, tnaeai"oni, and |)otatoes have a tendency to pro- 
ducf» con.-li|)ation in many individuals. 

1 J>;.<ril.<,.< nfthr I lit., in,.-, J). 1 11. 



DIET IN INTESTINAL DISEASES. 481 

A mono; the laxative foods may be mentioned fruits and certain 
vegetables, as encumbers, tomatoes, and cabbau^c; cider, butter- 
milk, beer, and the carbonated waters also exert a laxative elfcct. 

In the third class, foods tliat have no especial effect on the 
intestinal movements, may be placed meats, fish, eg<z;s, toasted 
bread, and zwieback. It must be remember(Hl, however, that 
certain foods that prove laxative in one individual may be con- 
stipating in another, so that no precise rules c^an be formulated ; 
in each case individual tendencies nnist be consulted. 

In severe forms of intestinal disturbances rectal alimentation 
must often be resorted to. For a furtlier consideration of the 
technic and forms of food to be utilizcxl in this method of feeding 
the reader is referred to the section on Rectal Feeding. In those 
cases in which food cannot l)e given either by the mouth or by 
the rectum subcutaneous feeding becomes necessary ; for this 
purpose olive oil may be used ; one ounce may be injected 
twice daily under the skin, best in the region of the thigh ; in 
some cases normal salt infusions are indicated. 

DIET IN INTESTINAL DYSPEPSIA. 

In intestinal dyspepsia food should be given frequently and 
in very small quantities. At first only the liquid forms should 
be used, such as weak tea, peptonized milk, malted milk, 
bouillon, and egg-albumin ; after a few days the patient may 
gradually be placed on the following diet : calves' brains, sweet- 
breads, broiled steak or lamb chops, soft-boiled eggs, boiled 
fish, such as mackerel or rock, baked potatoes, spinach, aspam- 
gus, and stewed fruits.

DIET IN ACUTE INTESTINAL CATARRH. 

As in aciito o^astric eatarrli so also in acute intestinal catarrh 
the regulation of th(^ diet is ])rol>al)ly the most ini])ortant factor 
in the treatment of the disease. The ])atient should be ke})t in 
bed; after the bowel has l)een thorouii;hly emptied by a cathar- 
tic, li(|uid foods, such as clear broths, — at first without, and 
tJien with eggs, — thin gruels, light tea, cocoa cooked in water, 
and egg-albumin, should be given exclusively ibr several days. 
In this condition milk should not, as a rule, be given. When 
there is extreme thirst, the carl>onated waters may be allowed, 
but only in small quantities. The thirst is best relic^ved bv 
placing bits of crushed ice in the patient's mouth. After the ])ain 
and discomfort have disappeared, toast, crackers, stewed chicken, 
soft-boiled eggs, mashed potatoes, and boiled ricx? may be added 
to the diet ; indigestible foods, such as raw fruits, heavy vege- 
tables, and fatty and acid foods should be avoided for a consid- 
erable period of time after the catarrh has disappeared. 

DIET IN CHRONIC INTESTINAL CATARRH. 

The dietetic treatment in chronic intestinal catarrh depends 
upon the condition of the fecal movements ; these are, in a 
measure, an index as to the portion of the bowel involved. 
According to Nothnagel,^ cases of chronic intestinal catarrh may 
be divided into four groups : 

'' 1. Cases characterized by pronounced constipation. An 
evacuation appears only once in two, three, or four days ; some- 
times only with the aid of cathartics. The fecal matter is 
usually hard. As a cause of the constipation, Nothnagel as- 
sumes a decreased activity of the automatic nervous apparatus 
of the intestines, this being the result of the catarrhal process. 

'' 2. Cases in which constipation and diarrhea constantly 
alternate. For two oi- three days there ma}' be a daily evacua- 
tion of very hard dejecta. On the following day there may be 
four to six very thin or mushy movements mixed with mucus, 
accompanied by violent pains, and then again consti[)ation for a 
day or two, etc. Or there may be quite a normal evacuation 
(once daily) for a few days in succession and then again four to 
seven diarrheal movements in one day, and after this constipa- 
tion. The ])rincipal feature of these cases is the constipation, 
but the excitability of the nervous apparatus being quite good, 
the decomposed stagnant contents often cause increased peris- 

^ Spccielle Patiioloyie und Thcrap., vol. xvii., p. 119. 



484 DIET IN DISEASE. 

talsis and diarrhea. Sometimes these alternating periods of 
constipation and diarrhea continue for a long time. Thus the 
])atient may be constipated for four or five weeks, or even for a 
few months, and then again the diarrhea may set in, lasting 
several weeks or months. 

" 3. In a very limited number of cases there is a daily evac- 
uation, which is usually not formed or mushy. 

" 4. Cases in which there are for months several diarrheid 
evacuations daily. The dejecta, as a rule, show the biliary re- 
action, or they may contain yellow fragments of mucus, yellow- 
tinged epithelium, and round-cells. In these cases the catarrhal 
process affects not only the large bowel, but also the small in- 
testine. The absorption suffers, and there are more abnormal 
products in the contents (acids), which give rise to increased 
peristalsis in the small as well as large bowel.'' ^ 

The treatment of chronic int-estinai catarrh therefore resolves 
itself into the treatment of the accompanying chronic constipa- 
tion, chronic diarrhea, or a condition of constipation alternating 
with diarrhea. 

Diet in Chronic Constipation. — In this condition a 
mixed diet, containing, so far as possible, those substances 
that stimulate the intestinal peristalsis, should be prescribed. 
Astringents and anything that tends to produce constipation, 
such as cocoa, chocolate, tea, red wines, rice, farina, etc., should 
be avoided. 

The following foods should be prescribed in cases of chronic 
constipation : Graham and rye bread with butter, fruit, butter- 
milk, kefir, cider, beer, fresh vegetables, as cabbage, sauer-kraut, 
and salads. Fats are especially to be recommended, and honey 
is also useful. Salts stimulate the intestinal movements, there- 
fore foods containing salts are indicated in this condition ; among 
this class may be mentioned herring and caviare. Sugar, espe- 
cially milk-sugar, has a marked tendency to increase intestinal 
])(.'ristalsis. Water taken cold or on an empty stomach will also 
stimulate intestinal movements.

Diet in Chronic Diarrhea. — When severe symptomF, 
pucli as intense diarrheii and pain, ])resent tlicnisolves th(; 
patient must be i)ut to bed and kept on a very riirorons diet; 
the period of rest may be lengthened or shorteiuMl nceordino; to 
the severity of the disease. In moderately severe eases several 
weeks will usnally suffice. Xonrishment should be taken in 
small quantities eveiy few hours, sufficient uiust, however, be 
given to maintain the body weiglit. All cold driuks or carbon- 
ated waters, fruits, cabbage, and salads are to be avoided. The 
most suitable foods in this disorder are broths containing barley, 
rice, and farina, soft-boiled eggs, sw^eetbreads, stewed chickeu, 
broiled steak, boiled fish, toast, crackers, baked potatoes, tcii, 
milk (boiled), and cocoa ; in many cases port wine is quite use- 
ful, as it contains tannin, which acts as an astringent to the 
bowels. In this condition milk even when boiled is often not 
well borne, and must then be avoided. 

The followdng diet-list, taken from Boas,- illustrates the method 
of prescribing nourishment in chronic catarrh of the intestine 
accompanied by diarrhea : 

8 A. M. : Eichel cocoa (in water), one saccharin tablet for crystallose), toast 

and butter (20 to 30 gm.). 
10 a.m.: One ciij) (200 gm.) rice gruel, buckwheat, or oaten grits in veal 

bouillon (avoid salt). In addition: 50 gm. roasted veal or beef 

(scraped), fried iish or cold meat (avoid salt or strongly ])ickled 

ham). 
1 P. M. : Soup of peas or beans or ])uree of oatmeal, farina, or cornstarch, etc. 

(addition of nutrose or eueasin allowed ; somatose forbidden). In 

summer huckleberry soup (with saccharin if desired). 
200 gm. of rice bouillon (avoid rice with milk) or larina bouillon, well 

thickened by cooking. 
Green vegetables or potates in puree form (50 to 100 gm.), meat 

and fish (fat excepted) (50 to 100 gm.) (butter sauce allowed; 

cream sauces or highly seasoned sauces forl)idden). 
Stewed fruits, with the exception of hucklebeiries and cranberries, 

forbidden. 
Custards (corn-st<irch, with a little yolk of c^^'j; and sacciuirin) 

allowed. (Avoid fruit-juices.) 
As beverages: IIucklel:)erry wine, Burgundy, ( amarite, Simaruba 

wine, old Bordeaux. (Sweet wines, white wines, and eft'ervescent 

beverages forbidden. ) 
4 p. M. : Tea (without milk) with saccharin or cocoa, cakes, toast, zwieback 

(with butter). 
7 r. M. : Strained gruel (oatmeal, etc.), cold or warm meat (50 gm.), toast, 

butter (20 gm.). 

9 P. M. : One glass of huckleberry lemonade, warmed or hot mulled wine 

(saccharin), or tea without red wine.

486 DIET IN DISEASE. 

Zircir/'.'i DiH Lid for Chronic Intestinal Catarrh with Diarrhm. 

Early morning : Acorn cocoa cooked in milk (one saccharin tablet); toast, 
butter. 
Mo]-ning: One to two eggs, toast, butter. 

Noon: Soups (rice, barley, oatmeal witlinut salt). 
Minced meat or fisli (cooked in butter). 
Gelatin. 

Kice or macaroni. 
One to two gkisses of red wine. 
Toast. 
Afternoon: Same as eai-ly morning. 
Evening: Soup. 

Fish (minced). 

Gelatin. 

One glass of red wine. 

Toast, butter. 

In conditions of chronic intestinal catarrh in which 
diarrhea alternates with constipation the same plan of 
treatment may be followed as has been described for those cases 
accompanied by constipation or diarrhea ; it is especially impor- 
tant to treat by diet the more prominent symptoms, whether it 
be diarrhea or constipation. Mineral waters are freqnently 
utilized in casas of chronic intestinal catarrh. For cases 
accompanied by constipation the waters of Marienbad and of 
Saratoga (Congress and Hathorn springs) are most beneficial. 
Where diarrhea is the ])rominent symptom, Carlsbad and Vichy 
are to be recommended. 

DIET IN DYSENTERY. 

The diet in acute dysentery is similar to that ])rescribed 
in acute intestinal catarrh. The patient is put to bed and only 
liquid foods are administered. Of these the most suitable are 
bouillon, broth, egg-albumin, and tea ; gradually, as the con- 
dition improves, semisolids, such as milk-toast, rice cooked in 
milk or brotli, gruels of tn|)inea, <'tc., may be prescribed. Solid 
food should be abstained iVom initil a few days after the disorder 
has abat^'d. 

In chronic dysentery the f )od should be given in small 
Tjuantities at frequent intervals. All coarse, indigestible food 
.-hould be avoided. In oilier res|)ects the diet is similar to that 
already uiven under Chronic Intestinal Catarrh. 



DIET IN ULCERS OF THE INTESTINE. 

1. Diet in Ulcer of the Duodenum. — The diet in ulcer 
of tlie duodenum is the same as that of gtistricMilcer, and the reader 
is referred ibr the details to the .section (h^alinn- with this subject. 



DIET IN INTESTINAL DISEASES. 487 

In cases accompanied l)y heniorrlia<i;(' absolnte rest in bed must 
he insisted upon, and rectjil alimentation administered if neces- 
sary. After the first week the Leiihe rest cure shonkl he insti- 
tuted, according to the methods des('rih(>(l elsewhere. The first 
form of food to he allow(>d is milk ; aftci- the lirst week Carls- 
bad water should be given in the morning. In very severe eases 
Boas advises exclusive rectal feeding lor one or two weeks. 
The authors have had exceedingly favorable results in the treat- 
ment of many cases of duock^ial ulcer by means of the Lenhartz 
cure. (See Ulcer of the Stomach.) 

2. Diet in Other Forms of Intestinal Ulcers. — In 
addition to ulcers occurring in tlie duodenum, tuberculous ulcers, 
syphilitic ulcers, toxic ulcers, amyloid ulcers, and dysenteric 
ulcers may occur in the intestine. In any form of ulcer the 
diet should be non-irritating and easily digestible. Among 
those foods that may be given are milk, eggs, rie(% farina, sago, 
all forms of broth, especially chicken and nnitton broths, sweet- 
breads, stewed chicken, baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, tea, 
cocoa, crackers, and toast. 

DIET IN MALIGNANT GROWTHS OF THE INTESTINE* 

The medical treatment in malignant grow^ths of the intestine 
is only an adjunct to the surgical treatment always indicated, 
and consists solely in treating the symptoms as they arise. The 
diet should be highly nutritious and at the same time eiisily 
digestible ; small quantities of food should be given at frequent 
intervals. Milk, broths, soft-boiled eggs, raw scra})ed beef, 
sweetbreads, baked and mashed potatoes, vegetables, such as 
carrots and ])eas, that have been finely divided and strained, 
stewed fruits, toast, and crackers are permissil)le. 

DIET IN ACUTE INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. 

The treatment of acute intestinal obstruction, except when 
due to the impaction of a foreign body, when It may possibly 
be ])assed through the bowel, is purely surgical ; as Treves has 
said : " There is one measure for acute intestinal obstruction, 
and that is by means of laparotomy." J^revious to operation 
the following dietetic regulations should be carried out : The 
patient should be kept in bed, and in the acute attacks all food 
should be withheld. Thirst may be quenched by small bits of 
ice kept in the mouth or a few drops of hot water may be given 
at frequent intervals. If the disease extends over a period of 



488 DIET IN DISEASE. 

several days, rectal alimentation or the administration of salt 
solutions must be resorted to. 

DIET IN CHRONIC INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. 

In this condition the diet should chiefly be liquid or semi- 
solids. All indigestible food should be avoided, especially those 
forms that are apt to leave a large amount of residue in the 
bowel. The f )()ds to be avoided are salads, heavy vegetables, 
and fruits. Milk broths, eggs, broiled meats, chicken and 
sweetbreads, boiled fish, rice, farina, toast, crackers, and butter 
are permissible. In advanced cases rectal feeding must be 
carried out. 

DIET IN APPENDICITIS. 

The dietetic treatment in this disease must be governed by 
the symptoms, for surgical treatment is usually indicated. The 
patient should be put to bed, and under no condition be allowed 
to rise until recovery is complete. During the first days 8ahli 
and Penzoldt recommend that all food be withheld ; liquids, 
such as egg-albumin, weak tea, thin broth, barley- or rice-water, 
or milk diluted with lime-water, may be given in small quanti- 
ties when deemed necessary. When the acute symptoms have 
subsided, this diet can be increased somewhat : the milk may 
be taken undiluted, and eggs may be added to the broth. When 
the pain and fever have disappeared entirely, gruels made of 
rice or barley, soft-boiled eggs, scraped beef, stewed chicken, 
toast, and crackers may be added to the list; still later mashed 
potatoes and vegetables — finely divided and strained — may be 
allowed, and finally, when the patient is well, the usual diet 
may be resumed. 

Ochsner^ advises the following plan of treatment in all cases 
of appendicitis in which operation is to be performed, l)elieving 
tliat it hmIuccs the mortality and changes tlic class of cases in 
wliich the mortality is groat<'st into another class in which the 
mort^dity is very small after (>])erati(>n : 

" In every case of acute appendicitis all food by mouth and 
all cathartics are prohibited. In case the patient suifers from 
nausea or vomiting, gastric lavage is at once employed. In 
the milder «ises the patient is permitted to rinse the mouth 
with cold water and to drink smidl sips of very hot water at 
short intervals. In the severer easels the patient is permitted to 
rinse tlie mouth with cold water, but is not permitted to drink 

1 "The Mortaliiy in Appendicitis/" Mrdiml ycvs, May 2, 1903. 



DIET IN INTESTINAL DISEASES. 489 

either hot or cold water for the first few days until the acute 
attack has subsided, when the use of small sips of hot water is 
begun. If the nausea ])ersists, gastric laviigc is repeated once 
or twice at intervals of two to four hours, in order to remove 
any substance which had regurgitated into the stomach from 
the small intestine.^' 

" The patient is supported by nutrient enemata consisting of 
an ounce of one of the concentrated predigested liquid foods in 
the market, dissolved in three ounces of warm normal salt solu- 
tion introduced through a catheter which is inserted a distance 
of two and one-half to three inches. In ca«e this gives rise to 
pain or irritation or nausea, it is interrupted for twelve to 
twenty-four hours at a time. In cases in which no wato" is 
given by mouth an enema of eight ounces of normal salt solu- 
tion is given four to six times a day in addition to the nutrient 
enematii. In cases operated during the acute attack this treat- 
ment is continued for several days after the operation," 

''After the patient has been free from pain and otherwise 
practically normal for four days he is first given from one to 
four ounces of weak beef-tea, preferably prepared from com- 
mercial beef extract, every two hours. In a few days one of 
the commercial predigested foods, dissolved in water, is substi- 
tuted ; still later, equal parts of milk and lime-^vater; then 
general liquids, then light diet ; and finally, after the patient has 
fully recovered, full diet is given." 

DIET IN MUCOMEMBRANOUS CATARRH OF THE INTESTINE. 
Various diets have been recommende<l in tliis disorder by 
different writers. Fleiner advises a simple non-irritating diet; 
others, as von Noorden, recommend a very coarse diet — one 
that will leave a large amount of residue in the intestine. The 
authors believe, with Einhorn, that a middle course is best, and 
therefore prescribe a nutritious mixed diet that is not too coarse ; 
on such a diet the movements of the bowels becouK^ more n«irly 
normal and the secretion of mucus is lessened. Von Noorden 
recommends a diet consisting '' largelv of (xraham bread — 250 
grams a day in addition to a great variety of leguminous vege- 
tables, including the husks ; vegetables containing nuieh cellu- 
lose ; fruit with small seeds and thick skins, like currants, 
goose-berries, grapes, besides large quantities of fat, in particu- 
lar of butter and bacon. The permanent effect of the diet is 
chiefly due to the amount of cellulose which it contains. This 
cellulose undergoes decomposition in the intestines and thus 
softens the movements." Of fifteen patients who were treated 



490 DIET IN DISEASE. 

by voii Noorden in this way, seven were cnred and seven im- 
proved. In conjnnction with this diet mineral waters are used ; 
of these, waters containing sodium chlorid are especially to be 
recommended, in particular those of Kissingen and of Wies- 
baden. (For a discussion of the treatment of mucomembranous 
catarrh other than by the diet — e. /y., by oil enemata, irrigations 
of the bowels, etc. — the student is referred to the text-books 
on intestinal diseases.) 

Ewald ^ advises the following diet in certain cases of mem- 
branous colitis : 

^' It is only rational that in these cases a mild, nourishing diet 
should be instituted, which through its nourishing qualities 
produces a laxative effect. This diet may be followed when- 
ever constipation does not exist — a so-called lactovegetiible or 
even constipating diet. The following diet scheme reconnnends 
itself for this purpose : Breakfast : Sweet milk, cocoa, oatmeal 
with cocoa, white or dark bread, with honey, jam, or fresh 
fruit. Dinner (])referably at midday) : Vegetables or fruit, as 
apples, plums, blueberries, ras})berries, cherries, a broth of 
vegetable sou]->, spinach, tomato, or beet souj), a milk soup, or 
curded milk, butter, and a liberal amount of fresh vegetables 
are desirable, or ])ea, rice, or lentil sou]), stewed vegetiibles 
Avith dumpling, macaroni, puddings, blanc-mange with fruit- 
juices, etc. ; salads, and eggs variously ])repared, bread with 
butter, and a light cheese. Sup])er : A thick soup, made with 
barley, rice, tapio(;a, etc., baked potatoes, eggs, bread, butter, 
cheese, milk, etc. 

^' According to the needs of the ]mtient the foregoing diet 
will be more or less carefully followed, and on certain days a 
small amount of meat may be allowed by way of variety. 

"While this diet is directed especially against the local 
intestinal condition, still it serves well to support and improve 
the general nutrition, because of the high percentage of carbo- 
hydrates and fats, which is very important."

DIF/r IX IXTESTIXAL DISEASES. 491 

DIETETIC TREATMENT OF NERVOUS AFFECTIONS OF THE 

INTESTINE. 

1. Atony of the I^arge Intestine. — Tho dietetic treat- 
ment of this disorder is identical to tliat indicated lor liahitnal 
consti})ation, to bi; described liirtlier on. 

2. Flatulence or Meteorism. — Tins condition is char- 
acterized by an excessive accnmnlation of i2:as in tlu^ intestine. 
In the dietetic treatment, therefore, foods that tend to ])rodnce 
large qnantities of gas, such as beer, cidei-, carbonated waters, 
fruit, cabbage, rve and Gnjham breads, and potatoes, sh(»nld Ix.' 
avoided. The disorder is often of ])urely nervous origin, ;nid 
when this is the case, unrestricted diet is to be recommended — 
one that will ttme up the patient's system and thus cause the 
flatulence to disappear. 

3. Diet in Intestinal Neurasthenia. — This disease 
resembles nervous dyspe])sia. At times the most indigestible 
food is well borne, whereas the digestible forms create dis(;om- 
fort ; in each case it is important that the diet be regulated 
according to the patient's digestive })o\vers. Generally a lil)- 
eral diet is indicated in these cases ; in many instances a sys- 
tematic rest cure is needed to bring about relief. 

DIETETIC TREATMENT FOR HEMORRHOIDS. 

Since constipation is often a frequent cause and accompani- 
ment of hemorrhoids it is important that this condition be cor- 
rect. As has been pointed out elsewhere, proper diet plays 
an important role in the prevention of chronic constipation. 
Patients afflicted with hemorrhoids should eat in moderation, 
but should avoid all excesses of food and drink. An abund- 
ance of outdoor exercise, consisting of walking and simple 
gymnastics, should be indulged in, violent gynmastics and 
horseback-riding should be avoided. A daily evacuation of 
-the bowels should be secured. Patients with hemorrhoids 
should avoid alcoholic beverages, spiced foods, strong colfee 
and tea, cheese, cabbage, and beans. The foods most suited to 
this condition are ])otatoes, carrots, s]iinach, as])aragus, and 
even salads, since they stinuilate intestinal ])eristalsis and thus 
help to keep the stools soft. Stewed and raw iruits, includ- 
ing grapes, oranges, pears, and ap])les, are als(^ beneticial. 
Water is the best beverage in this condition. The waters of 
Carlsbad, Kissingeu, and Saratoga are most beneficial ; tliey 
act best when taken at the springs.

DIET IN INTESTINAL DISEASES. 493 

Strictly Forbidden: 

Cold drinks; any kind of coarse ve^etal)le<, like cal)ba,t,'o or po- 
tatoes; cheese, acids, cakes, coffee, all leLMiincs (except wlien 
served in soups) ; goose, duck, salmon, animal fats, gravies, 
and raw fruits. 

The dietetic treatment of diarrhea must varv aeeordinir to 
the type of tlie disorder. In the nervous variety tlie {)atient 
should be instructed to restrain his bowel movenusnts excej)t at 
a certain hour in the morninp^. Under all conditions it is im- 
portant to exclude from the diet all foods tliat \nivv, a tendency 
to stimulate the intestines. Coarse, indi<i:estil)le foods, especially 
tliose containing a large percentage of celhdose, must be avoided; 
in this class are especially to be mentioned cabl)age, pickles, 
salads, turnips, carrots, all cold drinks, carbonated waters, and 
beverages (including champagne and beer). Among the foods to 
be recommended are broths, tea, red wines, farina, rice, and 
barley gruels. Raw milk usually has a laxative eifect, but 
when boiled or diluted with lime-water or brandy it is consti- 
pating, although in a certain number of cases it nmst be entirely 
excluded as it increases the number of movements. In a num- 
ber of cases of chronic diarrhea milk cures have been given with 
good results. The authors have succeeded in relieving cases 
of chronic diarrhea by systematic rest cures.

DIET TREATMENT IN HABITUAL CONSTIPATION. 

Aside from the general eause.'^ of cliroiiie constipation, such 
as hereditary tendencies, irregular habits, sedentary occupations, 
dietetic irregularities, and constitutional diseases, there are cer- 
tain local causes of chronic constipation which must be borne 
in mind. There are those forms due to retarded intestinal 
])eristalsis (atony of the intestines) and those due to spasmodic 
contractions of a portion of the intestine ; we, therefore, recog- 
nize an atonic constipation and a s])asmodic constipation. Both 
conditions may exist in the same individual. 

In the dietetic treatment of habitual constipation it is essen- 
tial that the food that is ingested should be such as will increase 
the intestinal movements. Those foods that leave a large bulk 
of fecal matter are useful for this purpose. Those tiiat leiive a 
small residue are most apt to j)roduce chronic constipation. A 
diet consisting principally of eggs and milk with only a small 
(|uantity of vegetables and water is one that is cx>nstipating. 

A glass of cold water taken bef )re breakfast will often regu- 
late the bowels ; o(;casionally, according to Penzoldt, a pinch 
of >alt added to the water will increase itv>^ eflica(w ; raw or 
cooked fruit, taken on an empty stomach morning or evening, 
occasionally gives good results. It is a well-known fact that

the smoking of a cigar in the morning will oft^'n stimulate peris- 
talsis. The patient should recognize the im])ortanee of having 
an evacuation of the bowels at the same time each day. 

Chronic constipation is a frequent accompaniment of dys- 
peptic disorders, and may he relieved by appropriate treatment 
of the gastric disorder. It should not he forgotti'n that habitual 
constipation is frequently induced by the persistc^nt use of 
cathartics, and the use of drugs should be avoided as nnich 
as possible in the treatment of this disorder. Sedentary habits 
are often the cause of constipation, and ibr this reason projxir 
exercise should always be prescribed along w^ith the dietetic 
treatment. The vegetables that are especially useful in the 
treatment of chronic constipation are spinach, ])eas, cauliflower, 
cabbage, asparagus, salads, onions, celery, and tomatoes. The 
cereals that stimulate the intestinal movements are oatmeal and 
corn meal. Graham, rye, corn, whole wheat, and bran breads 
are also useful. Other foods classed as laxatives are honey, 
cider, molasses, and acid fruits, such as ap[)les, j)ears, })eaches, 
cherries, and oranges. On account of the acids and seeds they 
contain, berries are effective laxatives. Prunes, dates, and figs 
are also to be recommended.

Habitual constipation is often due to the fact that water is 
taken in insufficient quantities ; therefore, in the treatment of 
the disorder, an abundance of water must be prescribed. The 



496 DIET IN DISEASE. 

foods to be avoided are tea, claret, cocoa, chocolate, rice, barley, 
and farina gruels, and huckleberries. In some cases milk acts 
as a laxative, whereas in others it has the opposite eflPect. For 
this reason its effect should be tested in every case. Boiled 
milk usually constipates. Buttermilk is preferable to sweet 
milk as a laxative. Most cases of habitual constipation can be 
relieved or cured by the dietetic treatment here laid down ; it 
is not within the province of this book to discuss the value of 
massage and electricity ; suffice it to say that they are reliable 
adjuvants to the treatment of constipation. 

The authors frequently prescribe the following diet in cases 
of chronic constipation :

Acute Peritonitis. — The diet in acute jieritonitis is purely 
of secondary importance, and requires consideration only until 
operative procediu*e can be undertaken. The starvation treat- 
ment or the so-called Ochsner treatment may be emj^loyed up 
to this time. The patient is placed in the Fowler or sitting

pelvis. Neither food nor drink should be given by mouth. 
An ice-bag is placed upon the abdomen. The stomach is 
washed out frequently to prevent vomiting, and continuous 
enteroclysis, according to the method of ]Murphy, should be 
practised. If operation is not undertaken and vomiting has 
ceased, fluids may be given in a few days. Foods that may be 
prescribed are milk and lime-water, diluted broths, and egg- 
albumen with or without brandy or shei'ry ; only very small 
quantities sliould be taken at a time, l^ut at frequent intervals ; 
gradually plain milk, broth, and gruels may be added to the 
list ; solid food should not be allowed for several weeks. AVhen 
stimulants are required, they should be given in the form of 
whisky, brandy, or champagne. 

Diet in Chronic Peritonitis. — The diet in chronic peri- 
tonitis should consi.^t of boiled meats, eggs, milk, stale bread, 
toast, or crackers, and veget^d)les, only, however, in the form 
of ])urees ; carbohydrates should be eaten s])aringly, on account 
of their tendency to ferment. ]^Vjod should be eaten in small 
quantities at regular but frequent intervals. 

DIET IN LIVER DISEASES, 

To prevent needless repetition, certain general dietetic rules 
wnll here be o^iven for the management of liver diseases in gen- 
eral. The tlieoretic discussions l)earing on this subject have 
become so numerous as to render even brief consideration of 
them impossible. For this reason the subject will be dealt with 
here only from a practical standpoint. 

The group of sym])toms generallv classed as " biliousness " 
are usually the result of overeating, and the so-called 'Millions 
attack " is nothing more than a cry of the liver for relief. 
Many individuals when they become constipated suifer from 
these attacks. These two facts furnish the indications for treat- 
ment : rest and o])en bowels. In the acute attacks all that is 
necessary is a restricted <liet ibr several days, together with the 
administration of calomel, f )llowed by a saline. The object of 
treatment in all diseases of the liver should be to give the organ 
as little work to do as ])ossible. Jt should not, however, be 
})ut at absolute rest, and it is ])r<jl)ably not possible to accom- 
})lish this end on ac(;ount of its influence on general metabolism. 
\n general, a sim])le, well-mixed diet containing ])rotein, fat, 
and carbohydrates is indicated. In cei'tain (lisea>(\s in which 
the i'unction of the liver is manifestly im|)aired, fat and carbo-

liydrates must he restricted or even omitted entirely for ;i few 
days. Both, if not })romj)tly disj)osed of, ai'e n])t to undergo 
changes in the intestinal eanal. 

Certain articles of diet an; known, while others are helieved, 
to be injurious in diseased conditions of the liver. Overeating 



IS mjurious, 



and, se< 



first, on account of the overwork it necessitates 



x'ondly, because the su])erliu()us food is apt to undergo 
putrefaction. The resulting bacterial j^roducts an,' believed to 
act on the livi^r in much the same maniuM- as does al(M)hol. 
The excessive use of alcohol produces marked changes in the 
liver in certain individuals. This has been proved by experi- 
ments on animals. In a series of exj)eriments pcM-fbrined bv 
the authors in the Pathologic Laboratory of the dolms ITo])- 
kins IIos]Mtal, J>altimore, actual cirrhotic changis in the liver 
were induced by tlie administration of alcohol.' Some persons 
may take alcohol continuously with impunity. W tidvcn in 
excessive quantities, however, over sufHciently jirolongcd pei'iods, 
it probably invariably produces chronic tissue changes. When 
a certain amount is taken, it seems to be l)urnt uj) in the body 
as food ; Avheu this limit is jxissed, it becomes a poison. In 
certain fevers enormous quantities may often be consumed with 
great benefit. Just what amount may be taken with safety bv 
any one individual is not known, and is dej)end(Mit in large de- 
gree on idiosyncrasy. It has been estimated that two ounces 
of alcohol on the average may be consumed as a food in twenty- 
four hours. The form and the amount of concentration of the 
alcohol are important factors in considering the effect of alcohol 
on the liver. Whisky, brandy, and si;nilar spirituous liquors, 
taken in a coneentrateil form, undoubtedly produce more marked 
tissue changes in the liver than light wines oi- beer. 

I71 (ill liver diseases alcohol should he (iroidaJ unless speciallv 
indicated as a tx)nic or stimulant. Jn any case it should be 
given well diluted. A w^ell-matured ])ure whisky well dihited 
with water is to be preferred, and this only in the sniailest 
possible amount. 

Certain foods have been regarded as "stimulating" or '* irri- 
tating^^ to the liver. Among these are [)eppers of various 
kinds, spices, mustards, concentrated meat extracts and meat 
broths, and the substances formed in roasted ami baked meats. 
To be proscribed are peppers, radishes, hoi'seradish, onions, 
watercress, and celery. Salt in too large (piantities is also to 

^ See Welch, The Phyxiologic Aspect.< oj tJir J.iqxor Question. 



500 DIET IN DISEASE. 

be condemned. Strong coffee and tea are harmful, but weak 
tea seems to be well borne in many cases. 

In severe diseases of the liver the diet must usually be 
restricted to milk, diluted or peptonized, gruels, albumin-water, 
kumiss, buttermilk, and bland broths, such as oyster broth. 
Orange-juice as well as lemonade may generally be allowed. 

In the milder disease and during convalescence the diet need 
not be so rigid, and lean meat, curd, junket, bread, toast, zwie- 
back, fresh fruit, or fruit stewed with little or no sugar, may be 
allowed. In the chronic cases and lighter forms the following 
articles may help to make up the dietary. Milk, variously diluted 
and prepared, buttermilk, curd, kumiss, custard, junket, eggs, 
lean meat, if beef or mutton, preferably rare, sweetbreads, 
chicken, squab, liver, the soft part of oysters, and the more di- 
gestible forms of fish. Fresh green vegetables and green salads 
without oil are permissible. Small quantities of well-baked or 
boiled mealy potato may be allowed once a day, for many 
persons do not relish a meal that does not contain potato in 
some form. The starchy foods should be partaken of some- 
what sparingly ; bread, toast, zwieback, pulled bread, and bis- 
cuits (crackers) may be permitted. Small quantities of cereal 
foods may be taken — rice, sago, and tapioca, when sufficiently 
well-cooked, may be allowed. Fresh fruit is a valuable adjunct 
to the diet. Oranges, grape-fruit, ripe peaches or pears, grapes, 
strawberries, ripe plums of the most tender varieties may all be 
taken. Stewed fruits only slightly sweetened and baked apples 
may be allowed with advantage. If there is constipation, steWed 
prunes are useful. Lemonade may be taken as a beverage. 

Mineral waters may be drunk freely if dr()])sy is not present, 
and are best taken on rising and between meals. Hot water is 
a valuable substitute for the mineral waters. It is especially 
useful in allaying thirst when there is dropsy. 

Tlie food should be taken slowly, well masticated, and never 
in too large quantities. If necessary, more milk may be given, 
so as to make large amounts of other food unneccessary. The 
patient should lie down directly before and after meals. In no 
case should the j)atient eat immediately after taking active 
exercise. 

In certain chronic conditions, such as hyperemia, fatty degen- 
eration, and chronic hepatitis, exercise is to be taken at proper 
times. 

In sunnner and in warm climates more vegetables are to be 



DIET IN LIVER DISEASES. oOl 

allowed and less meat. 1{ j)utreiactive changes take place in 
the intestine, a diet consisting of white of egg and water shonld 
be maintained nntil this condition is overcome. When the 
])utrefaction is cansed by torpidity of" the liver, it mav some- 
times be prevented by increasing the amount of vegetables and 
by the use of laxatives. 

CATARRHAL JAUNDICE. 

During the acute stage, so long as there is any tendency to 
vomit or while dyspepsia is marked, the patient should be kept 
quiet in bed. The diet should be very light and fluid. Fat is 
especially to be avoided, as are, of course, all foods that are 
either chemically or mechanically irritating. 

Milk, which may either be skimmed or diluted witli lime- 
Avater or mineral waters or peptonized, is probably tlie most 
useful article of diet. On account of the fat which whole milk 
(Mmtains it is, however, open to certain theoretic objections. In 
practice, nevertheless, it is generally well borne. Buttermilk 
or kumiss may also be used, as may beef-juice, oyster-broth, 
clam bouillon, albumin-water, and well-cooked and strained 
barley gruel. If the stomach is irritable, food should be given 
in small quantities and at regular intervals. As the stomach 
becomes tolerant and the appetite returns, bread, zwieback, 
toast, lean meat, such as the breast of chicken, sweetbreads, 
and tender steak or chops may be administered. Soups thick- 
ened with barley or flour may be given, and the lighter forms 
of fish may also be allowed. Fruit, well cooked and without 
too much sugar, may be added as convalescence progresses. 
All coarse forms of vegetables must be avoided, but spinach, 
asparagus tips, and cauliflower tops may be given. Well- 
cooked mashed ])otatoes may be allowed in moderate (|uantities. 
The menls sliould be small and, if necessary, may be given 
frequently. During convalesence, when the ap|)etite returns in 
full force, the ])atient sliould be cautioned against overeating. 
For several months the diet should be guarded and all irritating 
and coarse articles of food avoided. 

Cofl^ee and tea should be forbidden during the acute stage, 
but during convalescence they may be allowed, but should be 
given neither too strong nor in too great quantity. Alcohol is 
l)est avoided. Fats, such as butter and cream, should be with- 
held longest in the return to a full diet. If an excess of starch 
or of sugar is takcMi, disturbances are certain to follow ; if fats 



502 DIET IN DISEASE. 

are given in too great abundance or too early, putrefactive 
changes are apt to occur. 

^Mineral water may be drunk freely during the course of the 
disease, and the bowels should be kept open. Carlsbad and 
Vichy are especially to be recommended, ])ut other waters may 
be used. Plain carbonated water is useful as a beverage. 

Catarrhal Jaundice in Children. — The disease is rare 
in children under two years of age. The same general princi- 
ples of diet may l)e adhered to as when the disease occurs in 
adults. Fat, starches, and sugar should be reduced in quan- 
tity, and rare meat, fruit, and milk more plentifully supplied. 
If vomiting occurs, milk diluted with lime-water or a carbo- 
nated water, or pej^tonized milk may be used. If the gastric 
symptoms are severe, tlie diet should be the same as that for 
acute gastric indigestion. Calomel, the salines, and mineral 
waters should be prescribed to keep the bowels open. 

CONGESTION OF THE LIVER. 

Acute Congestion. — The treatment depends largely on 
the cause. AVhen the congestion occurs in the course of acute 
diseases, the diet is practically the same as that of the associated 
disease. When there is pain, rest is essential. If the patient's 
condition warrants, the diet should be largely restricted. 
Diluted milk, thin soups, albumin-water, and the like may be 
given in small quantities. In weaker patients the diet should 
be regulated according to the general condition ; if emaciation 
is extreme, a larger diet should be ordered, care being taken 
not to disturb the stomach. Milk, soups, lean meat, fruit, 
cooked fruit, and bread or toast should form tlie bulk of the 
dietary. All irritating foods, coffee, strong te^i, and alcohol 
are to be avoided. Salines are indicated in most cases. 

Passive Congestion of the I/iver. — The diet should 
be restncted and the same general principles observed as 
directed in liver disease in general. 

ACUTE YELLOW ATROPHY. 

The diet shouhl be restricted; usually only liipiids can be 
given, such as milk, diluted as in catarrhal jaundice, albumin- 
water, etc. In general the management resembles that of an 
acute fever. 

ABSCESS OF THE LIVER. 

In the e^rly i^hi<^v> the |)atient should be put at rest and 
receive a very light diet of milk, gruels, albumin-water, and 



DIET IN LlVFJl J) IS I : ASKS. 503 

the like. After operation the diet may he as mitritious as pos- 
sible, bearing in mind the o-ciieral pi-iiu^iplcs of diet in liver 
diseases. 

FATTY LIVER. 

The diet will depend npon the exeitin^; cause. When the 
fatty liver is the result of general obesity, the treatmciut should 
be along the lines indicated ibr that coiKHtioii. \\lien it is due 
to tuberculosis or to other chronic ini'ections, the diet should l)e 
arranged accordingly. In the severe cachexias that mark incur- 
able diseases little can be done in the way of diet. 

In general the food should be easily digest il)le ; milk, lean 
meat, and eggs are mainly to be relied on. Predigestcd milk 
and meats may be of value, but fats and oils should be avoided. 

AMYLOID LIVER. 

This is usually caused by long-standing su])puratioH. The 
food should be as easily digestible as it is ]iossible to make it. 
At the same time the largest amount of protein materi;d con- 
sistent with the patient^s digestive powers, should be given. 

SYPHILIS OF THE LIVER. 

The diet should be arranged according to the general prin- 
ciples laid down for liver diseases in general. 

DIET m GALL-STONE DISEASE. 

Cholelithiasis is a subject of ever-increasing interest. It is 
estimated that about 10 per cent, of the population of Ger- 
many have gall-stones. Kehr states that only about 5 ]->er 
cent, of these ever give rise to serious disturbances, Xumerous 
theories have been advanced regarding the cause of the forma- 
tion of gall-stones. Errors in diet and the various food ele- 
ments have been considered causative, and htive led to the 
establishment of various dietaries. ^lost obs(TV(M-s ai'c, how- 
ever, inclined to consider the prophylactic measures about to 
be described of value. (For an exhaustive discussion of this 
subject the student is referred to the article by Quincke and 
rioppe-Seyler in Nothnagers Encyclopedia of Jfcdicinc, which 
has been ably edited by the late Dr. Frederick A. Packard.) 

The two factors that in all probability exert the most inllu- 
ence on the formation of gall-stones are the stasis of bile and 
the inflammation of the bile-passages and gall-bladder. T(^ 
this end anything that will increase the i{o^v of bile should be 



504 DIET IN DISEASE. 

encouraged, and anything that retards it, avoided. To obviate 
the latter all food that is liable to cause indigestion, with the 
attendant dangers of putrefactive changes setting up inflamma- 
tory processes, should be carefully avoided. 

The patient should lead an active, if possible an out-of-door, 
life and physical exercise should be a part of the daily routine. 
Horseback-riding for those who are in condition and who can 
afford it is excellent. Walking, fencing, golf, tennis, and 
swimming are helpful, and where these are not enjoved, sys- 
tematic gymnastic exercises should be prescribed, fexercise, 
if the motions are violent enough, acts directly by forcing the 
bile from the liver and gall-bladder, and indirectly by increas- 
ing the movements of the intestines. 

The clothing should at all times be comfortably loose. 
AYomen especially should be cautioned in regard to this point. 
The corsets should fit loosely and be suspended from the shoul- 
ders, so as to take the pressure from the waist. After meals 
the clothing should be loosened, so as to relieve the abdominal 
organs from pressure. 

Constipation should studiously be avoided. The diet should 
be arranged with this object in mind, and the use of laxative 
salines is to be recommended where their use is necessary. 
Epsom salts and sulphate of soda are of especial value in this 
connection. If desired, the saline miineral waters may be sub- 
stituted, or, for those who can afford it, occasional visits may 
be made to various mineral springs. 

The meals should be taken at regular intervals not too widely 
separated. Prolonged fasting should never be permitted, for 
eating increases the flow of bile while fasting causes the bile to 
be stored up in the gall-bladder. Some yeiirs ago Frerichs con- 
tended that in cholelithiasis the meals should come close together. 
Care must, however, be exercised to see that the food is being 
thoroughly digested and moved along the intestinal tract nor- 
mally. Kehr advises a su])]K'r to be tjiken late at night. Other 
authors have advocat<'d waking the patient in the middle of the 
night to administer nourishment. This last would seem to be 
entirely unnecessary. JSaunyn insists on the im])()rtance of a 
sufficiently large breakfast and, indeed, a large meal after any 
fist. The average American breakfast is, however, sufficiently 
large in almost all instances. Care should be taken not to err 
in the opposite direction by giving more food than can be di- 
gested. 



DIET IN LIVER DISEASES, 505 

In the choice of food there are certain things to be avoided. 
In the first phice, all food that is not entirely above suspicion 
or that is liable to set up putrefactive changes nnist be inter- 
dicted. In tliis categ'ory are to be placed stale fruits, stide fish 
and shell-fish, overripe cheese, and the like. 

Fat should, as a rule, be reduced to a minimum, for there is con- 
siderable clinical evidence to show tliat an abundance of fat is 
injurious in gall-stone disease, as well as in other disorders of 
the liver. Whether the fat acts in any other way than in pro- 
ducing bowel disturbances is a question that has not yet been 
decided. Herter has recently pointed out tliat dogs fed for 
months on a diet rich in fat and low in ])roteins showed concre- 
tions in their gall-bladders. Fat, should, however, not be elimi- 
nated from the dietary altogether. 

Excesses in carbohydrates, either in starches or in sugar, 
should be carefully avoided. Anything that will irritate the 
liver should be prohibited, as should all rich and complicated 
dishes. Any food that is apt to cause indigestion is to be re- 
garded as unsuitable for the patient with gall-stones. 

Protein, carbohydrates, and fat should go to make up the 
dietary, which should consist of simple food, plainly prepared, 
with care, however, to avoid a monotonous diet. Meat should 
not be eaten too freely, and only the leaner varieties should be 
used. Milk and eggs are allowable, but if the milk is extremely 
rich, a })ortion of the cream should be removed. Some authors 
forbid the yolk of eggs as containing too much fat. 

The green vegetables and fresh fruits are suitable articles of 
food and may be partaken of freely. Cereals and potatoes may 
be used in moderation, but not where there is "starch indig(\<- 
tion.'' Turnips, beets, and the like may be ])artnken of s])aringly. 
While various authors forbid the use of some of these, it is 
probably not the choice, but the quantity, that should be con- 
sidered in this connection. 

Bread, rolls, and the like may be eaten ns desired, bearing in 
mind that in "starch indigestion '^ the amount should be limited. 
Pastry and any but the plainest cakes should be omitted from 
the diet. Harley made the statement that he believed that 
starch puddings and fat bacon caused more gall-stones in Eng- 
land than all other ibods put together. Alcohol should be 
avoided, but coffee and tea may be allowed in moderation. The 
drinking of hot water on rising and at bedtime has been ad- 
vised, as well as the various mineral waters mentioned in con- 
nection with constipation. 



506 DIET IN DISEASE. 

Coexisting diseases are believed to exert some influence on 
the formation of gall-stones, and when gout, chronic rheumatism, 
diabetes, obesity, or dyspepsia exists, the diet should be regu- 
lated accordingly. In few diseases are there so many contra- 
dictory opinions concerning diet as in gall-stone, and for this 
reason their discussion has been omitted entirely. 

QRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER. 

Hypertrophic Cirrhosis (Hanoi's Disease). — Hanot, 
in his monograph on the diseiise that bears his name, dismisses 
the subject of the diet almost in a word. He recommends a 
milk diet for weeks at a time where it is well borne. Where a 
more extensive diet is indicated the same lines may be followed 
as were laid down for cirrhosis in general. 

Cirrhosis. — So far as diet is concerned, all forms of cir- 
rhosis may be treated in much the same general way. Since no 
two cases are exactly alike, it must never be forgotten that each 
case requires individual consideration. The heart, the kidneys, 
or the alimentary canal may be involved, and ascites may be 
present. The existence of these complications materially affects 
the management of tlie case. 

Certain cases of cirrhosis are due to the long-continued use 
of alcohol, highly seasoned food in excessive quantities, and, 
probably, to chronic intestinal fermentations. Certain metallic 
poisons may also cause it. 

All individuals who are predisposed to cirrhosis, — those who 
come from families where liver disease or other forms of cir- 
rhotic disease are frequent, — should be cautioned in regard to 
the diet and the use of alcohol. Those large eaters and drinkers 
or .those who suffer from indigestion, discomfort, or even jxiin 
over the re<>;ion of the liver, should ])e ])ut on a simple diet, 
composed largely of milk ; the bowels should ])e kept open by 
the use of saline mineral w;iters ; alcohol should l^e withlicld 
altogether or reduced to the smallest possible amount. All ricli 
f)ods and those mentioned as irritating tlie lixcr should be 
avoided. If alcohol is given up and the patient lives correctly, 
much can often l)e done in the early stages to avert, or at least 
to postpone, the disastrous consequences. 

Cases without Ascites. — When the disease has been 
diagnosed, and if ascites is not ])resent, the patient may l)e i)Ut 
on a milk diet or a diet conq)ose<^l largely of milk and milk 
foods. Kumiss and buttermilk are verv useful. lOira-albumin 



DIET TX DISEASES OE THE PANCREAS 507 

and cereal gruels may also be used. Under a sinij)le diet of 
this kind the gastric syni])tonis may abate or even disappear. The 
saline mineral waters and ])otassium iodid arc; valuable adjuncts 
in the treatment. The consideration oi' other druos uselul in 
this condition does not come within the sco{)e of this work. 
When recovery has set in a simple diet, com])os(;d of milk, the 
lean, easily digestible meats, prei'erably broiled sl<'ak and choj)s, 
chicken, and the like, eggs, bread, green vegetables, and iruits, 
potatoes, and cereals, if desirtxl, are allowable. The me^ds 
should be small and taken at regular intei'vals. Hot watei* or 
the saline waters may be taken on rising and an hour or so 
before eating. The general principles for diseased conditions 
of the liver already described must be ibllowed. 

Cases with Ascites. — The selection of a diet for these 
cases is frequently a matter of considerable dilficulty. Rest, 
salines, and a restricted, somewhat dry diet often gives great 
relief. AVhen the kidneys are in reasonably good condition, a 
dry diet, such as is recommended for senile heart, may be tried. 
Hot water may be sipped on rising and at various intervals 
during the day, and helps to flush out the waste-])roducts of 
metabolism. Should kidney symptoms arise and the quantity 
of urine be greatly lessened, it is better to increase the allow- 
ance of fluid. 

If kidney diseases are present, it is not wise to attempt to 
relieve the ascites by w^ithholding fluids. When kidney com])lI- 
cations arises, French writers and others reconnnend a diet com- 
posed largely of milk, on the ground that it is a good diuretic, 
excreting not only the fluid itself, but a portion of the fluid 
held in the body as well. 

DIET IN DISEASES OF THE PANCREAS. 

lylttle has been written on this subject. Attempts at feeding 
pancreas by the mouth and by rectal enemata hav(^ not been 
productive of good results. It has been suggested that vihvu 
the diagnosis of pmicreatic disease has been made, both fats and 
carbohydrates be withdrawn from the diet, as they are apt to 
nndergo fermentation in the abs^'uce of the ])ancreatic juice. 
The bile may, however, assist in the enudsiflcation of fat, and 
pancreatic extracts or taka-diastase may be given by the mouth, 
with a view to aiding starch digestion. Pancreatic extract is 
best given in salol-coated pills. 



508 DIET IN DISEASE. 

The diet should consist largely of milk, which may be pep- 
tonized, predigested meat solutions, egg-albumin, and the like. 
Alcohol may be giv^en as required, both as a food and as a 
stimulant. 

According to Dolinski, the pancreatic secretion is increased 
by the ingestion of acids and acid drinks. Alkaline drinks 
diminish the secretion of the pancreas. An abundant diet 
causes an increase in the amount of the secretion. 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY 
ORGANS* 

DIET IN PLEURISY. 

The diet suitable in the treatment of pleurisy with effusion 
has been the subject of many experiments. The two principal 
methods advocated are : (1) To give the patient as dry a diet as 
is possible, in the hope that, by restricting the amount of fluid 
supplied to the blood, the absorption of the fluid effusion will 
be hastened. It has also been recommended that ordinary table 
salt be taken in large quantities, on the principle that, owing to 
the increased density of the blood, a more rapid absorption will 
take place. Schroth's ^' dry cure ^' has also been recommended. 
(2) The second plan, advocated especially by certain French 
writers, is to place the patient on an exclusive milk diet, in 
much the same manner as described in the Milk Cure. This 
is said to increase the excretion of urine, and also to cause 
the absoq^tion of the effusion. The return to a general diet 
should be gradual. Practically either plan may be followed, 
according to the condition of the patient. If there is fever or 
complicating kidney or heart disease, the milk diet is to be pre- 
ferred. If there are no com])licating diseases and no fever, 
ordinary diet with a lessened amount of fluids should be pre- 
scribed. No soups, but little coffee, tea, or other beverages, and 
as small an amount of water ns the patient can comfortably get 
along on should be nllowed. Large effusions are better removed 
bv aspiration than by diet. 



DIET IN EMPYEMA. 



The dietetic management of empyema is the v'^ame as that of 
any septic condition. If there is fever, the diet should be that 
advised in the treatment of fevers in general. If there is little 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 509 

or no fever, tlie diet should be similar to tliat recommended in 
tlie early stages of tuberculosis. Gilman Thompson advises a 
diet containing as much fatty food as the ])atlent can bike as 
best meeting the demands made on the system by the excretion 
of such large quantities of pus. Foods that cause the genera- 
tion of gas in the intestine should be avoided. This usually 
arises from an excess of carbohydrate food, but may also be 
caused by the ingestion of large cjuantities of fat. If there is 
marked tympanites, the embarrassment of the respiration is 
increased. 

LARYNGISMUS STRIDULUS. 

Attacks may be brought on by overfeeding, by the ingestion 
of indigestible articles of food, and by constipation. The diet 
should be carefully supervised, and the same general indica- 
tions met as in rachitis. 

LARYNGITIS. 

In chronic inflammations, es})ecially tuberculous laryngitis, 
certain dietetic measures may be employed that will give con- 
siderable relief to the patient. Hard and dry toasts and the 
like should not be eaten, as they give rise to pain on being 
swallowed. For the same reason highly seasoned foods are to 
be avoided. Only semisolid or liquid food should be eaten. 
Milk, custards, junket, soups and gruels, raw oysters, raw eggs, 
scra})ed beef, and the like are the most suital)le articles of diet. 
To allay the irritation in the larynx Loom is advises that a raw 
egg be sucked from the shell. If there is much pain on swal- 
lowing codein or cocain solutions should be a])plied locally 
before feeding. A tablet containing ^^^ of a grain of cocain 
may be ])laced on the back of the tongue and allowed to dis- 
solve. This is generally effective, and has the advantage that 
the patient can use it himself. 

Difficulty in swallowing may sometimes be overcome by the 
following two methods : By allowing the patient to lie flat on a 
lounge with his face over the edge. Food is to be sucked 
through a tube from a vessel placed immediately below. The 
second method consists in directing the patient to lean forward 
while eating. Sajous (quoted from Thompson) says that this 
latter posture causes the food to pass down along tlie pyriform 
sinuses, thus av.oiding the upper portion of the larynx, contact 
with which causes the severe pain experienced during degluti- 
tion in advanced cases of laryngitis. 



510 DIET IN DISEASE. 

DIET IN ASTHMA. 

Asthma usually (X'curs iu markedly neurotic individuals, who 
are apt to exhibit other neuroses, sucli as irastric and intestinal 
disorders. Various forms of food — c. //., the starches and 
sugars — have been said either to cause or to predispose the 
individual to astluna. 

As a matter of fact, many attacks of asthma are brought on 
by indigestion, this usually being directly traceable to some 
error in diet. So patent is this fact tliat certain cases are 
classed as ^' j^ieptic " or '' gastric ^^ asthma. 

Any food that causes indigestion should l)e avoided. Patients 
usually learn by experience ^yhat they can and what they can not 
digest. Some curious idiosyncrasies occur : For example, in 
one patient rice may cause indigestion — even when the most 
minute qujintities are introduced into his food without his 
knowledge an attack of indigestion and subsequently of astlima 
may supervene. These idiosyncrasies exist, of course, in otliers 
besides asthm.atics, and many remarkable stories, some well- 
authenticated, are told in this connection. 

The asthmatic should live a (juiet, well-regulated life. If 
there is any gastric or intestinal derangement, it siiould care- 
fully be treated. The diet should be light and nutritious, and 
should be taken at regular intervals. The meals should be of 
a size to be easily digested. A^iolent exercise of all kinds should 
be prohibited. 

The foods most suitable for the asthmatic are the lighter 
kinds of fish and meat — the white meat of chicken, roast-beef, 
beef-steak, chops, and mutton. The most easily digested vege- 
tables, such as spinach, asparagus-tips, cauliflower tops, baked 
potatoes, and the like, may be taken. Cereals and whole-wheat 
bread may be used in moderation. In most cases, plain des- 
serts may be allowed. I*ork, cheese, h(\avy cakes, pastry, and 
all similar indigestible articles of diet, sliould be avoided. Fat'^, 
sugars, and starches should ])e taken in moderation, if at all. 
Experience will generally prove the best guide as to what is 
suitable. Foods that are a])t to cause flatulence are best 
avoided. 

Dinner should be taken in the middle of the day, and the 
supper should be light. Fating at night should be discoun- 
tenanced. Tea and coffee, if they do not cause ga.-trlc dis- 
turbance, may be taken in moderation. Strong coifee has l)een 
credited with warding off attacks; for this })ur])ose two or three 



DIET IN DISK ASKS OF Till-: IH.'SrinATORY ORGAXS. 511 

cups of strong eoiloe are to be taken just Ix'fore a threatened 
attack. 

In the weaker p:itients alcohol may he allowed, \)0<i: ^iven 
in the form of good matured whisky. JJeer and ales should he 
avoided by most jxitients. Kvery case ol" asthma sliould he 
studied carefully in order to learn what food is and what is not 
harmful. All asthmatics probably give up many articles of 
diet that are in reality indicated in their condition. 

DIET IN EMPHYSEMA, 

Patients with emphysema should seek to prevent flatulence 
and constipation. All indigestible foods shoidd be avoided, 
and the diet should be along the same lines as indicated in 
asthma. Starches and sugar should be taken only in moderate 
quantities, as otherwise they may ferment and give i-ise to 
flatulence; the dyspnea tliat it is apt to bring on may be a 
source of great discomfort. In the later stages milk is found 
to agree better than any other food. Cod-liver oil, when it 
agrees with the patient, is to be recommendcHl. The meals 
should be small enough to be easily digested, and the heaviest 
meal should be taken in the middle of the day. 

DIET IN CHRONIC BRONCIilTIS. 

The dietetic management of chronic bronchitis is similar to 
that advised in the early stages of tuberculosis. In the dryer 
forms demulcent drinks are useful, and hot ikix-seed t<'a. swe<^t- 
ened with sugar and flavored with lemon-juice, should be taken 
in sufficiently large quantities and is j^articularly eirective. Hot 
drinks of various kinds may be used, and are es])ccially useiul 
in temporarily relieving troublesome cough. Hot millx' or hot 
lemonade, or, if stimulants are indicated, whisky and glycerin, 
may be given. 

DIET IN HEMORRHAGE FROM THE LUNGS. 

When a patient has had a hemorrhage from the lungs he 
should immediately be put to rest and kept absolutely (juiet. 
If the hemorrhage has been severe and the patient is in danger 
of collapse, in addition to the usual morphin injections, normal 
salt solution may be given by the rectum or subcutaneously. 

The food should be liquid in form. Peptonized or plain 



512 DIET IN DISEASE. 

milk, liquid beef peptonoids or similar preparations, fresh beef- 
juice, bouillon, and the like may be used, and should be given 
in small quantities at regular intervals — two or three ounces 
may be given every two or three hours. If there is a tendency 
to vomit, food may be given by the rectum. 

To allay thirst only small quantities of fluid should be given 
at a time. Later, when the stomach is tolerant, larger quantities 
may be prescribed. 

If there is no recurrence of the hemorrhage and the condi- 
tion of the stomach permits, a rapid return should be made to 
an ordinary diet. Meat should be given in abundance to coun- 
teract the anemia. 

Alcohol is, as a rule, best avoided. If it is needed as a stimu- 
lant, it should be given in small quantities. In very severe 
cases larger quantities may be required to support the heart. 

DIET IN PNEUMONIA, 

In pneumonia, feeding is of the greatest importance. The 
patient^s strength must be fostered, for the better the nutrition 
is maintained, the more likely will the patient be to withstand 
the effects of the disease. Formerly, owing to energetic, but 
often misdirected, treatment, many patients died in the early 
stages of convalescence. The French writers described their 
patients as having " died cured ^* — mort giieri. 

The same general principles of feeding should be followed as 
are indicated in all acute fevers. During the course of the 
disease the patient should receive an abundance of water in 
addition to the liquid food sup})lied. Plain water or any car- 
bonated water that the patient may desire should be given. 
Milk and seltzer may be allowed freely. Lemonade, or orange- 
ade, or water flavored with timiarinds may serve to lend variety. 
The "imperial drhik '' (the recipe for which appears at the end 
of this book) may also be given. 

During the height of the disease milk should form the basis 
of the diet. This may be peptonized or diluted with lime- 
water. Albumin-water, wine whey, malted milk, beef-juice, 
Eskay's food, and similar preparations may be employed when 
milk is not well borne. Predigested liquid beef preparations 
may be used both for their stimulating effects and as a food. 
They should always be diluted freely with water, unless, because 
of vomiting, a concentrated food is indicated. 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 513 

Food should be given at regular intervals of from two to 
four hours, according to the patient^s condition and the amount 
he is able to take at one time. 

Constipation, flatulence, and vomiting are to be avoided where- 
ever possible. If they do occur, efforts should at once be made 
to relieve the condition. 

In most cases starches and sugars are best omitted from the 
diet. Fruit may be allowed at any time during the disease, 
and is of sj>ecial benefit during convalescence. Most grateful 
dui'ing the severe stage are orange-juice, lemonade, grape-fruit, 
and grapes. During convalescence ripe peaches or pears in 
season may be added to the diet. The return to a general diet 
should be made gradually, and no solid food should be allowed 
until the fever has subsided. Then the general dietetic rules 
for convalescents may be followed. 

Pneumonia patients show a wonderful tolerance for alcohol, 
and it is apparently utilized by the body as a food as well as a 
stimulant. Large quantities may often be taken without pro- 
ducing any symptoms of intoxication. Should they occur, it 
is an evidence that the dose has been too large. Alcohol 
should not be prescribed as a routine measure, but should be 
ordered as soon as the heart begins to flag. The indication for 
its use may generally be determined by auscultation before 
either the symptoms or the pulse point to the need for it. It 
should be given at once when the first sound of the heart 
becomes prolonged and weaker. In weak individuals, whatever 
their age, especially in patients over fifty, alcohol may be begun 
early. The dose for adults is one-half an ounce of pure whisky, 
sufficiently diluted, every four hours ; this may be increased 
when necessity arises. Strychnin and other heart stimulants 
have obviated the need for the enormous doses of alcohol for- 
merly prescribed. In alcoholic subjects it should be given regu- 
larly. If it is withdrawn, delirium or colla])se may ensue. 
The usual care should be observed in determining whether the 
stimulant is doing good or harm. It is best given in the form 
of pure matured whisky, but champagne, brandy, or rum 
may occasionally be substituted when these are better borne. 
In all cases they should be well diluted with plain or carbonated 
water. 

Pneumonia in Children. — The same general plan is to 
be followed as when the disease occurs in adults, and both 
lobar pneumonia and bronchopneumonia require the same diet- 
etic management. 
33 



514 DIET IN DISEASE. 

The food should be given at regular intervals, or if the child 
is at the breast, it should be nursed at regular intervals. If a 
child at the breast is too weak to nurse, the milk may be 
pumped out and given by means of a stomach-tube or a spoon. 
The stomach-tube should not, however, be used in pneumonia 
except as a last resort. 

When infiints are fed on modified cows' milk, the milk 
should be further diluted with lime-water. Food should not 
be given oftener than every two hours, and if a sufficient 
quantity is taken, the interval may be lengthened to three or 
four hours. Milk is the most important food, and may be 
diluted with lime-water or with carbonated water. It may be 
peptonized partially or completely, or l)e prepared with the 
Peptogenic Milk Powder, with Eskay's, Mellin^s, or similar 
foods, or malted milk may be used. Buttermilk, plain or pre- 
pared after the method directed in the section on Infant Feed- 
ing, may be tried. Kumiss is often retained where plain milk 
is rejected. If milk is not well borne, barley or oatmeal gruels 
may be used by way of variety. If these cause flatulence, 
they should be avoided. Albumin-water and fresh beef-juice 
are useful foods, and such preparations as Panopepton, liquid 
beef peptonoids, and predigested beef are of great service when 
other foods are not well retained or assimilated. Beef broth or 
other meat broths may occasionally be given. 

The problem of feeding children suffering from pneumonia is 
frequently a very difficult one, for while they may take a food 
reiidily, they may refuse it the next time it is offered or vomit it 
if taken. When milk is well borne, it should constitute the diet, 
but where it is not, the ])hysician must have as many resources 
as possible. From one to six ounces, according to the age and 
condition of the patient, may usually be given at a time, but it 
may at times be necessary to give the food in tcaspoonful or 
tablespoonful (juantities. 

\? there is much vomiting, equal parts of lime-wat^r and 
cinnamon-water may be given to great advantage. A tea- 
spoonful of this mixture fifteen minutes before fe<'ding may allow 
the food to be retained where it would otherwise be rejected. 

Wat(T should in all cases be offi'red the child from time to 
time, and the mistid^e of forcing the child to take food when it 
wants only a drink of Avat<T should be avoided. If there is 
no flatulence, the carbonated waters are often very well borne. 

Alcoholic stimuhuits are generally needed and are well borne. 
Whiskv or brandv diluted witli at least eight parts of water may 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. 515 

be given, a little sugar or glycerin being added to overcome the 
sharp taste and render it more palatable, in pneumonia, as in 
other diseases, alcohol is borne better when it is given in small 
quantities and frequently, than when larger doses at greater 
intervals are prescribed. The average interval is two hours, 
but it may be given hourly or even more frequently when 
occasion demands. 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY 
SYSTEM. 

DIET IN DISEASES OF THE HEART, 

Diet in Acute Heart Disease. — In acute endocarditis 
and pericarditis the diet may be difficult to arrange satisfac- 
torily. In general, it should be ordered as in any acute infec- 
tious disease, and if there is broken compensation and edema, 
the suggestions made below for the same stage of cln'onic dis- 
ease should be followed. 

Diet in Chronic Heart Disease. — This may be con- 
sidered under two heads, the stage of compensation and the 
stage of broken compensation, and a few words may be added 
to cover the period of threatened rupture of comjiensation. 

During the period of perfect compensation the patient should 
observe the general rules which apply to all })atients with heart 
disease. The following of these will in many cases postpone 
the stage of brokeu comjiensation. Many patients are careless, 
and it is not until the first symptom of threatened rupture that 
they can be induced to take care of themselves. In addition 
to food it is highly important that the patient should avoid 
hurry, worry, and irregularity of life. 

The meals should be small — more should never be given than 
the patient can easily digest. If the stomach Is overloaded, the 
diaphragm is pushed up and displaces the heart, and this may 
occasion palpitation and dyspnea. If the meals are too large, 
the residue of any digested food in the intestine may undergo 
fermentation and cause flatulence, with its attendant disagree- 
able symptoms. 

The meals should be simple and well cooked. Improperly 
prepared food is a cause of indigestion, and may produce flatu- 
lence or discomfort. The food should be of a kind that is easy 
of digestion. A sufficiently long interval should be allowed to 
elapse between meals, and eating between meals should be strictly 



516 DIET IN DISEASE. 

prohibited, as even small portions of food taken while digestion 
is in progress may give rise to flatulence in these patients. 

The meals should all be of about equal size ; while the even- 
ing meal may be a little smaller and lighter than the others, 
and the principal meal should be taken at midday, there should, 
as has been said, be but comparatively little difference in their 
size, and the patient should be instructed carefully in this 
regard. 

The food siiould not be taken too hot nor too cold. The 
amount of food and its choice should be largely that of a 
person of the same size in health. The amount of protein 
should be about 120 grams per day for the average-sized person, 
and this may often be reduced to advantage. In case the kid- 
neys are affected, it may still further be reduced — some 20 to 
40 grams. The amount can be regulated by careful observa- 
tion of the patient. The aim should be to get the ])atient to 
normal weight and keep him there, to have as perfect digestion 
as possible, and, above all, to avoid constipation. The remainder 
of the diet should consist of the usual quantities of fat and 
carbohydrate. If the patient is gaining in weight, tiie total 
amount of food may be diminished, and especially the carbo- 
hydrates. If these latter cause flatulence, or any other gastric 
or intestinal symptoms, they should be reduced. 

All hio-hlv seasoned food and the condiments in jreneral 
should be omitted from the diet, as they tend to stimulate the 
appetite of the patient, and may cause him to take more food 
than it is necessary or desirable for him to have. 

Stews and fancy dishes should also be omitted, as should the 
foods usually classed as difficult of digestion, such as fried 
foods and the like. 

The amount of fluid should not be too large nor too small. 
The total fluid should perha})s not exceed six to eight glasses a 
day, with an occasional water-drinking day. Tea and coflce 
may be taken in moderation if they agree. In some individ- 
uals they may be omitted to advantage, and these :ire the })ersons 
who suffer from flatulence, indigestion, wakefulness, etc., alter 
the ingestion of either. 

Tobacco is b(\st forbidden, (^X('e])t in seasoned smokers, in 
whom the tolerance lor it lia< been \v(^ll estai)lished by 
years of indulgence. Kv<'n in these the amount should be 
limited. 

The di<'t should consist largely of milk and of dishes made 
from this food, eggs, rare meats, es})eeially nnitton and beef. 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. 517 

poultry, fish, and oysters. Well -baked hread, rolls, or bis- 
cuits, which are never to be e^iteii warm, and cereals in mod- 
erate quantities may be allowed. Well-cooked potatoes, spin- 
ach, asparai^us tips, cauliflower tops, and similar veiz:etables may 
be taken, all stalks Ijeinjj:; avoided. 

The diet-list should be sunple, and such as will not reqnire 
burdening the patient with complicated directions. 

As compensation becomes impaired num(!rous disoi-ders of 
digestion occur and require care and att(;ntion. 'I'Ik; patient 
with heart disease may develop a distaste for ibod, and this will 
often tax the ingenuity of the physician. 

As blood stasis sets in, constipation is apt to occur. Hypo- 
static congestion of the liver conies on, (causing lessened iiict- 
abolisra and consequently interfering greatly with the gcnci-al 
nutrition. The stomach and intestine are affected, and a 
chronic catarrhal condition of both is generally present. 

The quantity of fluid given should now be regulated care- 
fully, neither too much nor too little being given. A glass of 
Vichy half an hour before eating will help to prepare the 
stomach for a meal, and will, as a rule, be excreted ])romptl^^ 
Fluid is absolutely necessary for meti^ibolic changes, and may 
be taken in tlie form of the " im])erial drink," elsewhere 
described, between meals. A glass of hot w^ater flushes out 
the body, and, as it is rapidly excreted, does not add mjiteriallv 
to the amount of fluid present. 

In the Oertel treatment of heartdisease the fluids are allowed 
only in a very limited degree. If the patient is on a milk diet, 
other fluids besides milk should be given in comparatively 
small quantities. 

If edema is severe, the food may be given in as concentrated 
a form as possible. 

If flatulence is troul)lesomes, fats, starches, and sugars, as 
well as beer, pastry, and stews, are to be avoided. No solid 
food should be feiken between meals* Coffee or tea taken ^\ith 
the meals may give rise to flatulence. They may, however, in 
some cases be taken during the day, at a time when the stom- 
ach is empty; they should be freshly pre])ared and should 
never be strong. Only such quantities of food as the patient 
can digest should be allowed, and, if necessary, digestion may 
be aided by giving essence of pepsin or other digestives. In 
some cases a milk diet may become necessary. Sometimes 
buttermilk, or wdiole milk that has been inoculated with the 
lactic acid bacillus, is of great service. 



518 DIET IN DISEASE. 

Sudden dilatation of the heart occurring during or following 
any acute disease requires rest and a milk diet. 

Palpitation and dyspnea are often caused by the ingestion of 
too abundant meals ; if persistent, the food should be given in 
smaller quantities and at shorter intervals. Four or five small, 
instead of three large, meals may be taken at regular intervals, 
or a milk diet may be ordered for a time. The general manage- 
ment may be such as has been suggested for flatulence. Tea, 
coffee, and tobacco should be avoided, and effervescing drinks 
may also be omitted. If there is constipation, stewed fruits, 
especially prunes or figs, are useful. 

Gastric disturbanceji are best met by rest and a milk diet for 
a time, with a gradual return to the ordinary diet or a diet such 
as is advised for cases of gastric catarrh. Much relief fre- 
quently follows the drinking of a glass of hot water or of 
Vichy half an hour before a meal. 

As ruptured compensation is accompanied by effusion, some- 
thing must be said with special reference to the removal of 
fluids from the body. Here, indeed, feeding is a difficult t^isk, 
for the patient usually has a disgust for food. As Broadbent 
says, the object is to keep down the volume of the blood while 
maintaining its quality. If the patient is very ill, nourishment 
may be administered every three hours. If he is able to be 
about, it will often be well to allow him to take his meals with 
the family at the regular meal-time. Pie may be given chicken, 
tender meats, fish, oysters, junket, and other forms of light 
food. When l)ut little is taken at the regular meal-time, food 
mav be given between the meals, at regular periods, time being 
allowed for complete digestion to take place. Milk, albumin- 
water, egg and milk, soup, or beef-tea in small quantities are 
useful for this purpose. Broadbent recommends mcjit or 
chicken jelly or meat extracts, for their stinuilating effect on 
the heart. Potted-meat sandwiches or meat pulj), prepared as 
directed for tuberculous patients, may be given. In Germany 
raw ham is sometimes ])rescribed. Constipation may often be 
avoided by adding stewed fruit, })runes, or figs, or vegetable 
purees, all in small (juantities, to the diet. If necessary, pre- 
digested foods may be used. 

Fluids other than milk and sou]is should be taken in as 
sm;dl quantities as possible. '' Imperial drink " or hot water, 
as previouslv suggested, may be given to quench the thirst. 

Stimulants are usually needed, but should be given only 
under the supervision of the physician, as there is a tendency 



DIET IN JJISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM, oil) 

to take too much to relieve faintness or otlier Pvni])tom8. In 
noii-alcoholics, from one-lialf to two ounces of whisky a day 
may be allowed at tlie l)eij:;iuniug, the anioiuit heinjj;; increased 
as occasion demands, StimulatiuiX dru^s have larirclv super- 
seded the use of alcohol in th(\se cases. 

HEART LESIONS IN CHILDREN. 

The diet is essentially the same as that fni- adults. Children 
who are able to be about recpiire careful suju'rvisiou, the treat- 
ment beint^ along the same genc^-al lines as were laid down I'nr 
adults. Less food is required than in health, and the meals 
should be smaller. Care should be exercised to -ee that the 
food is eaten slowdy and well masticated. The diet slnudd con- 
sist largely of milk^ ^gg'S? '"iiid meat, with or without a cereal, 
and vegetables, the last being of the more easily digested \arie- 
ties, such as w^ell-cooked spinach, asparagus-tips, and cauli- 
flower tops, as these are least apt to cause flatulence. h'resli 
young peas, mashed and strained, and fresh, tender string- 
beans may also be allowed. Potatoes, either well baked or 
well boiled and mashed, may be eaten in small (|uantities. All 
coarse and stalky vegetables are to be avoided. If there is 
flatulence, the carbohydrates, as well as the fats, may be vei*y 
much lessened or omitted t<^>mporarily. 

In the more severe cases milk agrees better than any other 
form of food, and should be given in small (piantities at regular 
intervals. As a rule, it should not be taken too cold. The 
various modifications of milk and other li(|ui(l foods that ha\e 
been mentioned in connection with ])neunionia may be em- 
ployed. In some cases, especially when dro])sy is sev(>re, theiv 
is no desire for food, and the problem of feeding then becomes 
a difficult one. In these cases predigested foods of various 
kinds, raw meat-})ulp, as advised in tuberculosis, and beef-tea, 
beef-extract, and the like, may be tried. 

SENILE HEART. 

Balfour's little book on The Senile Jleart will prove a valu- 
able guide to the care and management of the aged. In his 
chapter relating to diet he says : ''Cardiac troubl(\s are always 
alarming, particularly in old age, but much may ho done to 
relieve the patient and to prolong his life. Attention is to 
be paid to the little things of daily life — the little things of 
eating, drinking, and doing — that influence the jxitient's comfort 



520 DIET IN DISEASE. 

and gradually turn the scale of health in his favor. The physi- 
cian's regulations are often pitted against the habits of a life- 
time, and difficulty may be had in securing acquiescence. All 
heart affections of the old are not necessarily senile in character 
or origin. Many cases may be of very long standing. Senile 
cardiac failure is essentially based upon imperfect metabolism. 
The diet must be regulated to suit the patient, and certain 
things must be considered. Most of the patients are below or 
at their usual weight. These require careful regulation of a 
normal dietary, to be given presently. A smaller number are 
over their normal weights, and suffer more from breathlessness 
than the preceding class of cases. These require to be specially 
dieted and cared for, s(j as to remove the obesity without dimin- 
ishing the cardiac energy or the strength of the myocardium. 
Lastly, there are those in whom there is more evident failure 
of the myocardium. There are more evidences of dilatation of 
the heart and of the tissues. Such cases require a specially 
dry diet.'' 

Four Important Rules. — 1. An interval of five hours 
should be allowed to elapse between meals. 

2. No solid food should be taken between meals. 

3. All persons with weak hearts should take their principal 
meal in the middle of the day. 

4. Persons with weak hearts should take their meals in as 
dry a form as possible. 

All indigestible food should be avoided. Especially to be 
mentioned in this class are dried, salted, or otherwise preserved 
meats, cheese, jiastry, all other foods in wliich fatty matter has 
undergone prolonged exposure to heat, and all sweets and nuts ; 
owing to their liability to cause flatulence, vegetable food must 
be chosen with care. Vegetables of the cabbage family, and 
carrots, turnips, and parsnips are regarded with disfavor by 
Balfour. Even potatoes sliould be eaten sparingly. Fruits 
should not be crowded into a meal as a dessert, but may be 
allowed to form })art of the meal, especially at breakfast or at 
a midday dinner. 

No good is to be gained by attempting to enf )rce dietetic rules 
founded on the number of grains of carbon or nitrogen required 
to carry on the processes of life. 

The foods to be allowed persons with weak hearts are the 
tender varieties of white fish, chicken, rabbit, game, mutton, 
or well-grown lamb, all of which Balfour gives in j)reference 
to tough beef. One well-boiled, ripe, mealy potato may be 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. 521 

allowed at dinner. Spinach, since it does not cause flatulence, 
is the safest vegetiible ; asparagus-tops, onions, and tomatoes 
may be taken in moderation. Peas, beans, and other legumi- 
nous foods, when fresh, young, and green, may be [)artakcn of 
in moderation. 

Not more than five ounc^es of fluid, and if possible less, 
should be tidven with a meal. W water is desii-ed with tli<' 
meals, it should be taken hot and sipped slowly, li' tea is 
used, it should be weak — a teaspoonl'ul of the tea to live ounces 
of water, steeped for not more than three minutes. {\A\\-i' may 
be sweetened to taste, and taken black or with cream. Choco- 
late and cocoa are too rich for those with weak hearts, but if 
taken alone may occasionally be useful. 

Alcohol should be prescribed only as it is needed. So manv 
patients have been accustomed to its use all their lives that it 
cannot be cut off altogether. For those to whom alcohol is 
^)ermitted half an ounce of Avhisky, brandy, or gin may be 
given in three or four ounces of water twice a day, together 
with their food ; or a single glass of sherry or port or two 
glasses of any lighter wine, such as hock or claret, each glass 
to hold two fluidounces, may be ordered. The stronger wines 
are best omitted, as they are liable, if taken in larger (pianti- 
ties, to give rise to dyspepsia. Champagne is, as a rule, for- 
bidden. Idiosyncrasies occur in regard to the eifect of wine, 
so that the individual case must be considered l)efore it is 
ordered. Alcohol is best given in the form of ])ure whisky 
and water, always in extreme moderation. As a stimidant ibr 
a weak heart, small quantities of alcohol are frequently pre- 
scribed, to be tiiken at various times during the day. This is 
most injurious treatment, for althotigh the ])rimai'y eifect of 
alcohol is stimulating, secondarily it is depressant. A better 
plan is to direct such a patient to take two or three sips of 
water, as hot as can be swallowed, occasionally throughout the 
day. Apart from that taken in the food fifteen ounces of 
water a day arc all that shoidd be allowed, but if -evere thirst 
is complained of, a half pint of hot water may be sipped about 
four hours after each meal or only after the princij)al meal. 
This cleanses the stomach and prepares it for rest. Hot water 
quenches the thirst better than does cold. The thirst is usually 
due to a catarrhal dyspepsia, and soon disappears after the 
diet has been regulated. The following is Balfour^s dietary, 
which is easily modified : 

" Breakfast 8.30 : One small slice of dry toast, weighing 



522 DIET IN DISEASE. 

about an ounce and a half, with butter ; one soft-boiled or 
poached egg, or half a small haddock, or its equivalent in any 
other fresh white fish, with from three to five ounces of tea or 
coffee, with cream and sugar. If there be any difficulty about 
the tea, it may be replaced by a similar quantity of infusion of 
cocoa-nibs, or milk and hot water, or cream and seltzer water. 
Some prefer oatmeal porridge, with milk or cream, and in ordi- 
nary circumstances this need not be objected to, provided not 
more than four or five ounces of milk be taken, and the por- 
ridge be not more in quantity than three or four ounces of oat- 
meal, well boiled : provided, also, that porridge alone be taken, 
and not porridge first, followed by tea, toast, etc., which is 
destructive of all comfort, both for stomach and heart. 

" The prineipal meal of the day, whatever it is called, lunch 
or dinner, should be taken about 1.30 or 2 o'clock, and may 
consist of two courses, not more — fish and meat, or fish and 
pudding, or meat and pudding. Soups, ])astry, pickles, and 
cheese are absolutely forbidden. "White fish and meat with 
short fibers are preferred. Half a haddock, or its equivalent 
in any other wliite fish, boiled in milk, steamed, or broiled, 
never fried ; wing and part of the breast of a chicken, or its 
equivalent in sweetbreads, tri])e, rabbit, game, or mutton ; one 
single potato or a little s})inach. For ])udding, any form of 
simple milk pudding may be taken, or about half a pound of 
such fruits as pears, ap])les, grapes, etc., either cooked or un- 
cooked. During this meal four or five ounces of hot water may 
be sipped if desired. 

'' From o to three or four ounces of tea may be taken if 
desired, infused, as in the morning, not longer than four min- 
utes, and with cream and sugar if wished ; but no solid food 
must be taken with it — not even a morsel of cake or biscuit. 
If th(!re ])e any difficulty about the tea, fbui* or five ounces of 
hot water may be substituted for it, and if there seem any need 
for a stimulant at this time, a teaspoonful of Liebig's extract 
of beef may be stirred into it. 

^'Supper, or the last meal of the day, nuist always be a light 
meal. It should be taken a])out 7, and may consist of white 
fish and a potato, or toast, with l)ntter, or some milk pudding, 
or breiid and milk, or Ilevalenta, made with milk or with Lie- 
big's extract of beef. At bedtime, fi)ur or five ounces of hot 
water will soothe the stomac^h, ])romote slee]), and pave the way 
for a comfortable breakfast next morning." 



DIET IX ])fSEASI':S OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. 



rv7: 



When there is anasarca, the followin*^ "<h-y diet" is recom- 
mended by Balfour. 

^^ Breakfad. — One single slice of dry toast, weighing about 
an ounce and a half, with no butter, but with a single cup of 
tea infused not longer than four minutes, with cream and sugar, 
amounting in all to not more than four ounces, and nothing 
else. 

^' Dinner. — Not more than the lean of two cho[)s, or its 
equivalent in chicken or fish ; no vegetables ; as much dry 
toast as may be desired ; half an ounce of brandy, whisky, or 
Holland gin, in three ounces of water, and nothing else. 

^' Supper. — As much dry toast may be taken as is desired, 
along with lialf an ounce of brandy, wliisky, ov gin in three 
ounces of water ; and nothing more." 

It is not desirable that a patient in this condition drink nuich, 
even between meals, but if thirsty, he may be |)ermitted to sip 
slowly three or four ounces of hot water about an hour before 
each meal. 

ARTERIOSCLEROSIS. 

In most cases of arteriosclerosis symptoms of senile heart 
occur at the same time, and the same general principles may be 
followed as were directed for that condition. Hie French par- 
ticularly advocate a milk diet In the treatment of arteriosclerosis, 
and wdiere there are headaches, insomnia, and other untoward 
symptoms, an absolute milk diet may be used with advantage. 
As soon as the symptoms disappear a mixed diet may be sub- 
stituted. (See Milk Cure for methods of giving milk.) Min- 
eral water may be prescribed, or trips may be made annually to 
mineral springs. Whenever possible alcohol should be pro- 
hibited. 

ANEURYSM. 

In most cases of aneurysm that are proving troublesome the 
treatment consists of rest, a restricted diet with a limited amount 
of fluid, together with potassium iodld. From ten to twenty 
grains of the lodid three times a day are sufficient. 

Certain cases of juieurysm may be relieved by rigorous diet- 
ing. The saccular forms, and especially cases of aortic aneurysm 
with small openings, are most apt to Im])rove under this treat- 
ment. Dieting is also helpful, it is said, in traumatic aneurysm. 
Tuffnell, of Dublin, advised the following diet : 

Breakfad. — Two ounces of bread with a little butter and 2 
ounces of milk. 



524 DIET IN DISEASE. 

Dinner. — From 2 to 3 ounces of meat without salt, and 4 
ounces of milk or claret. 

Slipper. — The same as breakfast. 

Absolute physical and mental rest must be secured for the 
patient, and a competent nurse who will see that the diet is 
strictly adhered to is essential. Thirst may be relieved by 
small quantities of acidulated dj-inks or by sips of hot water. 
Potassium iodid may be prescribed, as may also morphin. Few 
patients, hoAvever, are willing to undergo the suffering that such 
treatment entails, and not many will persist in it for more than 
several weeks. Tuffhell advised that it is to be followed for 
several months, and he and others report cures in certain cases. 
The anemia that follows may be extreme, and may leave the 
patient in a seriotis condition. 

Broadbent advises rest and small, equal-sized meals, taken 
at regular intervals. The meals must be concentrated, and 
bulky substances, such as rice, potatoes, and bread, are to be 
excluded from the dietary. The amount of water taken in 
twenty-four hours should not exceed forty oimccs, and as much 
less as possible is to be taken. Twenty-four ounces he places 
as the minimum. 

The object of the treatment is to produce the slow circula- 
tion of a condensed blood in the hope that fibrin may be formed 
in the sac. Burney Yeo does not favor such severe dieting. 

When the case is not a suitable one and is not giving especial 
trouble, it is probably best to recommend a quiet life and a 
simple diet, avoiding indigestible articles of food and those that 
cause flatulence. As Osier has said, the medical profession has 
furnished numerous examples of men wnth aortic aneurysm liv- 
ing for considerable periods and doing good work. Of these 
the late Hilton Fagge was a notable example. 

ANGINA PECTORIS. 

In this disease diet is of the greatest importance. The 
majority of cases occur in 'Marge e!Jiters,^' and, as Osier says, 
there is ''death in the j)ot." As a rule these patients realize 
that overeating is harmful to thein. 

The meals should be small and easily digestible, and all rich, 
highly seasoned food, as well as anything that causes fermenta- 
tion, should be carefully avoided. Flatulence is a sympt<^m 
that must, so far as possible, be avoided, for as soon as the 
stomacii becomes distended distress follows that may produce an 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. 525 

attack. The evening meal should be small, and eating late at 
night should be prohibited. 

If the patient is, in addition, the subject of gout or glyco- 
suria, his diet must be regulated accordingly. The diet suitable 
for various cases dift'ers widely, and personal idiosyncrasy must 
always be tidcen into account. 

In his lectures on angina Osier calls to mind tliat Dr. Smol- 
let, in llumphrey Clinker, makes one of his characters, Matt 
Bramble, say : '^ For my own part, I have had a hospital these 
fourteen years within myself, and studied my own case with 
most painful attention, consequently may l)e su])posed to know 
something of the matter.^' An intelligent patient should know 
what food does and what does not cause flatulence. Flatulence 
is most apt to occur in fat flabby patients and in those w^ith 
weak hearts and arteriosclerosis. Hot water taken half an 
hour before meals may be useful. 

In those with whom the drinking of stimulants is a life-long 
habit alcohol may be allowed, best in the form of hot toddy at 
bedtime. To quote Osier again this may prevent the flatulence 
that is apt to come on during the early morning hours. 

ANEMIA. 

Acute Posthemorrhagic Anemia. — Tl.c reader is re- 
ferred to the section on Diet after Operations for suggestions as 
to the diet in this disorder. In the case of the smaller hemor- 
rhages, which are rapidly recovered from, the usual diet may 
be followed. In the more severe forms, special care may be 
required. If the anemia that follows a severe hemorrhage l>e- 
comes chronic, the patient is to be managed the same as in 
chronic secondary anemia. If much blood has been lost, fluid 
should be supplied to the body in the form of normal salt solution, 
by transfusion into a vein, subcutaneously, by the rectum, or by 
the mouth, according to the condition of the ])atient. In most 
cases the fluid ]\nrt of the blood is rapidly replaced. If th(^ 
hemorrhage has l)een from the stomach or bowel, special man- 
agement, as detailed under their respective headings, is neces- 
sary. 

If the patient is very weak, cold milk is usually the most 
acceptable form of food. Hot milk is preferred by some, and 
is best for many cases. Fresh beef-juice and weak beef-tea are 
valuable, as is also albumin-water. As soon as the patient is 
able to eat, a diet containing considerable protein and the fresh 
green vegetables should be administered, as well as milk, eggs, 



526 DIET IN DISEASE. 

rare or raw meat, with spinach, asparagus-tips, apples, straw- 
berries, and other fresh fruits and vegetables. 

Indigestible articles should be avoided, and strong tea, coffee, 
and the much concentrated beef-teas should not be taken, espe- 
cially in the acute stages. 

According to the meager experiments and observations that 
have been made on this subject, the metabolic processes of the 
body are either about normal or similar to those going on in a 
condition of hunger. Iron in some form is advisable in the 
severer cases. 

Chronic Secondary Anemia. — Efforts should be made 
to locate and remove the cause. The diet should be about the 
same as that recommended for chlorosis. Fresh food, milk, 
eggs, meats, green vegetables, and fresh fruits are the most 
important articles of diet. Fresh air and sufficient rest are 
also essential. 

Pernicious Anemia. — In spite of the grave anemia the 
body fat and muscles often remain for a considerable time but 
little diminished in size. The blood destruction, however, is 
progressive, and tends to a fatal ending. Rest, removal to a 
different climate, fresh air, and attention to the diet may in some 
cases prolong life. Nevertheless the tendency of the disease is 
to Vjecome progressively worse. 

Owing to the anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea that are apt 
to be present, the diet is a matter of importimce. Coupland 
and Hunter claim that a carbohydrate diet is better borne than 
one composed largely of proteins. As the result of experiment. 
Hunter has been led to believe that intestinal putrefaction occurs 
less often on a milk and carbohydrate diet. 

Predigested foods, prepared infants' or invalids' foods, raw 
meat-juice, and similar articles of food may be allowed. Small 
quantities of alcohol may also be prescribe<^l. 

During recent years the bone-marrow of long bones of ani- 
mals has been reconnnended highly in cases of pernicious 
anemia. The marrow is eaten raw, in doses of from one to 
three tablespoonfuls twice daily. The authors have obtained 
good results in several cases from this form of treatment. 

CHLOROSIS. 

The diet for chlorotic ])atients is not generally understood, 
and therefore requires especial study. 

In chlorosis no changes occur in either fat or muscles. Some 
patients are fat while others are thin, this depending for the 



DIEiT IN DISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. 527 

most part on accidental circuimstanccs, and bearing only an 
indirect relation to the anemia. The thin patients are usually 
those individuals who are of that habit ; those who have co- 
existing disease of the stomach ; those who take too little food 
and who are, in consequence, suffering from malnutrition ; or 
lastly, those who must undergo considerable bodily exertion, 
usually in getting their livelihood. 

The fat patients and those who are often edematous looking 
are individuals who are either fat by nature or who are receiving 
too much milk or other fluid with their diet. 

Under a proper diet no change in the weight may occur ; or 
in the case of the fat, edematous-looking patients, there may be 
a loss in weight while the anemia is improving, or if the patient 
has been takino; too little nourishment or is doiufr too much 
work and is thin in consequence, there may be a gain in weight. 
The metabolic processes, so far as is known, are the same as in 
health. Owing to tlie lowered hemoglobin value of the blood, 
the patient is not able to exert herself much without producing 
great fatigue. 

In the treatment of the chlorotic patient three things are 
important : iron, sufficient food at proper intervals, and rest. 

Regarding the diet, the quality and the quantity of the food 
may be the same as in healthy individuals. The meals should 
be given at regular intervals, not too widely separated — usually 
not more than three hours apart. In consequence of the shorter 
interval and because the patient^s desire for food is apt to be 
lowered, the meals should be small. The appetite is capricious, 
and while the regular meals may be left untouched, such unde- 
sirable articles as pickles and sweets may be greedily devoured 
in the intervals. This tendency should be controlled and 
nothing allowed between the meals. Von Noorden recommends 
five meals daily— at 8, 10.30, 1, 4.30, and 7 or 7.30. This 
same observer also insists on the value of taking an abundance 
of protein food at breakfast, giving as his reiison that protein is 
the only food (alcohol not being considered) that is ready for 
use in the body shortly after ingestion. Carbohydrates for the 
most part go first to the liver, and fats are too slowly absorbed. 
The patient who takes the customary Continent^d breakfast of 
coffee and rolls has a long wait before the cells receive adequate 
nourishment. The kind of protein food is of little importiince, 
and may be either meat or eggs ; meat is, however, especially 
recommended, and should be taken regularly for breakfast in a 
definite quantity. 



528 DIET IN DISEASE. 

In general the diet should also contain sufficient protein, and 
von Noorden advises the use of such preparations as somatose, 
nutrose, protogen, or eucasin, when necessary to increase the 
quantity of protein. 

Milk is generally prescribed in too large quantities. This 
should be avoided where the appetite is small, as a glass of milk 
in these cases generally checks any further desire for food. It is 
also to be avoided in those cases in which the appetite is fair 
but the patient shows a decided tendency to take on fat or to 
becomes somewhat edematous lookiug. In these individuals the 
cells retain too much water. When there is atony of the 
stomach, water is to be taken in small quantities. Milk is to 
be used by patients who are thin . and where there has been 
a preexisting malnutrition. Milk and cream mixed is of great 
value. 

Fresh fruit and vegetables, particularly the green vegetables, 
are of especial value and may be partaken of freely. All kinds 
of fresh fruit in season are to be recommended, avoiding small- 
seeded berries where there is irritability of the stomach. If 
fresh fruits can not be obtained, properly prepared, evaporated 
fruit may be eaten and helps to regulate the bowels. Fresh 
fruit and vegetables do not, as a rule, cause the disturbance of 
the stomach so often attributed to them. In cases of ulcer of 
the stomach and often in other gastric disorders they must, 
however, be avoided. When fruit disagrees, it usually causes 
pain or flatulence. Von Noorden recommends that it be taken 
in the afternoon or with the meals. For Americans some fruit 
at breakfast is of value, but it should not be eaten to the 
exclusion of the more important meat. 

In the ordinary case of chlorosis alcohol may be dispensed 
with. If given, it should be done guardedly, as patients be- 
come accustomed to taking it to relieve the feeling of weakness 
and faintness. A small quantity of port, sherry, or one of the 
other stronger wines may be allowed as an appetizer half an 
hour })efore the midday meal. In the thin or overworked a 
good })eer may be taken in moderation with the principal meals. 
Red wine, which is often recommended, is of no particular 
value. 

Von Noorden gives the following suggestions for the selec- 
tion of the diet in chlorosis : 

The breakfast may be taken in bed, or the patient allowed to 
rest on a lounge for an hour after the meal. Many patients 
will go to sleep, and tliis should be encouraged by darkening the 



DIKT ly hlSKAS.i:S OF TliK CI Iirr LATiJlii' .SY^STLM. 529 

room and avoiding disturbing noises. Two or three ounces or 
more of meat should be taken, with as little other food as pos- 
sible. A slice or tw(j of toast or a piece of unsweetened 
zwieback may be given, together witli a small quantity of tea 
or coffee with but little sugar or cream. 

The second breaklast consists of two eggs, ])repared in what- 
ever way the patient prefers, with toast and butter and a glass 
of milk. A tablespoonful of cognac may be allowed in the 
milk or a small glass of Madeira, sherry, or j)ort may be given. 

The midday meal should be preceded by a complete; rest for 
half an hour. The patient may eat whatever she desires, but 
meat should always be eaten first. If the a})petite is poor, soup 
should not be allowed, or should be given after the meat has 
been taken. Thirst is generally marked at this time, but fluids 
should not be taken until the end of the meal, so as not to dis- 
turb the appetite. After eating the patient should rest from 
one-half to three-quarters of an hour. If there should be pain 
or discomfort in the stomach, hot applications may be made to 
the abdomen. 

In the afternoon, cooked or raw fruit with bread or zwieback, 
or, if fruit is forbidden, tea or cocoa and toast may be given. 
If there is no tendency to superacidity of the stomach, bread 
and honey or fruit-jelly may be allowed. A glass of milk or 
milk and cream should be taken after the meal. 

The evening supper should be as simple and as unirritating 
as possible. Four times a week a thick soup or gruel of oat- 
meal, barley, rice, or tapioca may be given, with meat-broth 
and butter or with milk and butter. If desired, eggs or other 
light foods may be given instead. Stewed fruit may also be 
allowed several times a week. If the hunger is not satisfied 
cold meat may be permitted in addition. On other days eggs, 
meat, or fish may form the principal part of the evening meal. 
A glass of well-brewed beer or a glass of milk may be given 
at bedtime, which should never be later than 10 o'clock. 

The diet in emaciated patients, since there is apt to be either 
loss of appetite or disease of the stomach, is sometimes difficult 
to regulate. A change of cooking may be beneficial. Von 
Noorden allows 100 grams of protein daily with butter, cream, 
or cod-liver oil. A moderate amount of carbohydrates may be 
allowed, but not to the exclusion of other food. Milk may be 
given an hour before rising in the morning, and alcohol may 
often be used with advantage. 

When the patients show a tendency to become fat and ap-

parently edematous, the diet must be made as dry as possible — 
somewhat similar to the dry diets recommended in certain heart 
diseases. Sweating may also be induced in order to reduce the 
amount of fluid in the tissues. Rapid recovery sometimes fol- 
lows this method of treating flabby chlorotic patients. When 
there is disease of the stomachy the diet is regulated accordingly. 
Constipation is to be relieved by suitable diet, or, if necessary, 
drugs may be resorted to. 

LEUKEMIA. 

The diet in leukemia should be a general mixed one, but 
should contain as much protein as possible. The choice of foods 
Avill depend largely on the condition of the stomach and intes- 
tines. In leukemia the metabolic processes are heightened. 

During the early stages, however, they remain about normal. 
As the disease progresses there is said to be an increase in the 
excretion of nitrogen. This calls for an extra amount of protein 
food to make up the deficiency. This may, however, be a diffi- 
cult matter, owing to the liability to cause disturbance of the 
stomach and intestines. Tlie diet should be arranged so as to 
contain the largest possible amount of easily assimilated protein 
material. Sugars, starches, and fats should be given sparingly, 
since their digestion requires too much time before they can be 
utilized by tlie tissues. 

Milk and the milk derivatives, such as buttermilk and kumiss, 
eggs, and the more easily digested meats should form the bulk 
of the dietary. When they agree, bread, toast, and well-cooked 
cereals may be taken in moderation. Of the vegetables, spinach, 
asparagus-tips, cauliflower to])s, and young green vegetables are 
to be preferred. The selection of the diet will often be governed 
by complicating bowel disorders. 

Alcohol may be allowed as needed, and the desires of the 
patient should be consulted as far as possible regarding the form 
in which it is to be taken. 

PURPURA HAEMORRHAGICA. 

Tvitten gives the following sugiicstions as to the diet in this 
disease: The food must be bland and should be given cool. 
Coffee, strong tea, and spirits should be strictly forbidden. 
Alcohol may be allowed when there is collapse. Milk and 
somatose in milk are suggested as the most valuable foods, but 
the diet may be arranged as in any acute lebrile condition. A 



DIET IN DISEASES OE GENnV-UEINARY SYSTEM. 531 

diet containing a considerable amount of gelatin has been 
recommended. Other authors suggest the use of an anti- 
scorbutic diet, although no good reason exists for this, except 
that some of tlie so-called cases of purpura may in reality be 
scurvy or something akin to it. 

HEMOPHILIA, 

A general diet, of which milk, however, forms a considerable 
part, is suggested by Litten, who also recommends the use of 
the fresh green vegetables and salads. Fresh fruit and lemon- 
ade may be used freely. Coarse food, especially the coarser 
vegetables, should be avoided. 

DIET IN DISEASES OF THE GENITO-URINARY 
SYSTEM. 

Urine and Food. — The urine bears a direct relation to the 
quality and quantity of the food ingested, as well as to the 
quantity of fluid taken luid the amount of work done by the 
individual. Many variations in the urine occur that are due to 
food or drink and that are normal. AVhen the kidneys are dis- 
eased improper food may bring on dangerous or even fatal con- 
ditions. After a large meal of any kind the urine becomes alka- 
line temporarily. 

The ingestion of large quantities of fluid and the eating of 
juicy fruits or vegetables tend to dilute the urine, and to render 
it less acid and its solid contents relatively less. With milk diet 
the urine becomes acid and indican may be found in it. .V con- 
centrated dry diet decreases the amount of urine, increases the 
specific gravity, and makes the reaction more acid. Animal 
food and the more nitrogenous vegetables increase the amount 
of nitrogen compounds and the acidity of the urine. Vege- 
tables increase the carbonates and the earthy salts of the urine. 
A purely vegetable diet renders the urine alkaline. Thompson 
states that Can tan i maintains that large quantities of vegetable 
acids will render the urine alkaline. 

I/iptiria, according to Halliburton, may be caused by a diet 
rich in fat, even when the kidneys are normal. 

Phosphaturia is believed to be increased by the use of 
potatoes, fruit, and all fresh green vegefcibles, and to be de- 
creased by adhering to a diet from which these have been elimi- 
nated. Such a diet would include meat, eggs, milk, cheese, 
cereals, and the legumes. 



532 DIET IN DISEASE. 

Oxaltiria. — This is a term applied to a condition where 
calcium oxalate crystals are deposited in the urine. The normal 
limit of oxalates excreted in twenty-four hours lias been placed 
by Senator at about 20 mgm. Whilst oxaluria may be regarded 
as an expression of a disturbance of metabolism, the quantity 
of oxalates excreted is only one factor to be considered. The 
second part of the question consists in the power of the urine 
to hold the otherwise insoluble calcium oxalate in solution. 
The solubility of this salt depends upon the acid phosphates, 
especially upon the quantity of magnesium salt present, and 
naturally it is influenced by the amount of calcium excreted in 
the urine. A urine containing a large quantity of magnesium 
phosphate and a small quantity of calcium salts will hold more 
calcium oxalate in solution than urine containing the reverse. 

Oxaluria is accompanied by a number of nervous and gastric 
disturbances, generally spoken of as either neurasthenia or 
nervous dyspepsia. The exact relation of these symptoms to 
oxaluria is not always clear, and clinically the symptoms which 
arise from the presence of oxalate crystals irritating the urinary 
passages and the danger of formation of stone, either in the 
kidney or bladder, are of much more importance. 

Previous to the experiments of G. Klemperer and Tritschler, 
it was not certain whether the oxalic acid excreted was derived 
from the food or from metabolic processes. It is beyond ques- 
tion, however, that foods containing oxalic acid when taken into 
the body increase the amount of calcium oxalate in the urine. 
If oxalic acid is neutralized with carbonate of soda and given to 
an individual, but a small part of it can be recovered in the 
urine or stools, the greater part of it disappears. Of the oxalic 
acid taken in the food materials, as in spinach, about 20 per 
cent, can be recovered in the urine and stools, most of this in 
the urine, whilst 80 per cent, of it disappears. This disap- 
pearance is caused by bacterial and chemical action in the intes- 
tines, changing the oxalates into other compounds. Oxalic acid 
is also destroyed in the blood, whilst calcium oxalate is not. 
When foods containing oxalic acid enter the stomach a part of 
it is dissolved in the gastric juice and about 10 ])er cent, 
absorbed. In the blood and lymph circulation this is changed 
into calcium oxalate and on X\\i\ following day it is excreted in 
the urine. 

Besides being taken into the Ixxly directly as oxalic acid, 
certain food substances are cliaTigcd in the })rocesses of meta- 
bolism into oxalic acid or oxalates and so increase the quantity

the amount of oxalic acid excreted during 



excreted in the urine. Substances containing many nuclei, as 
glands and also muscle, may be so changed that fat, carbohy- 
drates, and pure albumin are not, but Klemperer regards gelatin 
as a frequent source of oxalates. Uric acid is not changed into 
oxalic acid in the body, but it is ])ossible that lermentation in 
the bowel may lead to the formation of oxalic; acid. 

Furthermore, oxalates are n])])arently ibrmed in the body 
a])art from the food supply. I^iithje Ibund calcium oxalate in 

and there is a transient increase in 
the stiige of resolu- 
tion of pneumonia. Experimentally l\osen(|vist has ])roduced 
oxaluria by the destruction of the red blood-cells by the injec- 
tion of pyrogallic acid. Klemperer is of the oj)inion that jiart 
of the oxalic acid excreted comes from the metabolism of the 
resorbed bile, as in the bo^yel glycocoll is formed from glyco- 
cbolic acid. 

The arrangement of a diet to cure or to prevent oxaluria 
becomes clear upon a consideration of the foregoing statements. 
In the first place, the amount of oxalic acid and oxalic-acid- 
forming foods taken into the body must be diminished or cut 
off altogether. This means forbidding fruits and vegetables 
containing large amounts of oxalic acid, chief of which are 
spinach, sorrel, rhubarb, and cabbage. Gelatin and meats con- 
taining many nuclei, as glands, should also be forbidden. The 
followiup: tables £!:ive the oxalic-acid content of various foods :

The second indication is to lessen the absorption of oxalic

urine for calcium oxalate and so ])revent its deposition. This 
is accomplished by increasing the fluid and so increasing the 
amount of urine excreted, and by increasing the acid phosphates, 
especially the magnesium salts, in the urine and diminishing 
the amount of lime salts. In the table on page 534 the mag- 
nesium and calcium worth of various foods is given, and this 
table will be found of great practical value in arranging diet- 
lists. The foods containing more lime than magnesium are to 
be avoided, whilst the foods containing an excess of magnesium 
are to be chosen. This may also be aided by the administration 
of small doses of magnesium sulphate. Klemperer recommends 
about 2 grams (30 grains) a day, to be given over a long period 
of time. The acidity of the urine is also increased by the meat 
diet usually given in oxaluria. 

The following diet-list will be found of service : 

Allowable. — Meat or fish of any kind except glands. 

Milk and eggs are excluded by Klemperer on account of 
their lime content, but Minkowski is of the opinion that small 
quantities are allowable. If the symptoms are pronounced 
they should be forbidden, and in any case used sparingly if 
at all. 

Fat of any kind may be given except the yelk of an e^g. 

Stale bread and zwieback are the best carbohydrates, but 
rice, barley, and hominy may be given and all the legumes. 
Potatoes may be allow^ed. Apples are the best fruit. 

Beverage.^. — Water, beer, and weak coffee may be given. 
Alcohol may or may not be given, according to the individual 
and circumstances. It neither increases nor diminishes the 
excretion of oxalic acid. 

Avoid. — All glands, such as thymus, pancreas, liver, and the 
like. Grelatin calves' -foot jelly, and similar dishes. 

All fruits and vegetables containing much oxalic acid — as 
spinach, sorrel, rhubarb, cabbage, turnips, in a word all vege- 
tables except the legumes. 

Tea, chocolate, and cocoa. 

All rich and indigestible j)astries and cakes. 



536 DIET IN DISEASE. 

Indicanuria. — Underbill found that when gelatin was fed 
to a dog as the chief nitrogenous constituent of the diet, the 
urinary indican was greatly decreased, or if the indican was 
decreased by feeding the animal a diet poor in nitrogen, the sub- 
sequent administration of gelatin does not materially increase 
the output of indican. This might be used in the diet of 
patients with indicanuria. If otherwise permissible the nitro- 
genous food might be diminislied and gelatin added to the diet 
instead. There have been no clinical reports on this subject. 

Cystinuria. — Patients with cystinuria should live upon car- 
bohydrates, and fats with the mininuim amount of nitrogenous 
food. The protein may be reduced to 50 or GO drams a day 
for an individual weighing 70 kilos. 

AlbtHninuria is not, as a rule, caused by the ingestion of 
certain foods by healthy individuals. Some persons, however, 
possess the remarkable idiosyncrasy that egg-albumin, or even 
cheese or other articles of diet, may cause a temporary albu- 
minuria. These cases are of unusual occurrence. (The student 
is referred to text-books on clinical diagnosis or internal medi- 
cine for information regarding the many causes of albumin- 
uria.) 

Certain articles of food — and this is particularly true of 
asparagus — may impart a special odor to the urine. Shortly 
after eating asparagus the urine will give off a peculiar odor 
that may last for over half a day. 

The color of the urine may also be altered by certain articles 
of food. 

In considering the diet in diseases of the kidneys it is im- 
portant that the patient's condition be thoroughly understood. 
An accurate knowledge of the disease in question is indispen- 
sal)le for a proper understanding as to the necessary mode of 
feeding. It must ])e borne in mind that what is an indication 
of danofcr in acute nephritis, may not be so in chronic inter- 
stitial nephritis and vice versa. 

Too mncli stress is ordinarily placed on the presence of all)u- 
min in the urine. As Kmerson has shown, the percentage of 
albumin is the best index as to tlie progress of a case of alhu- 
minurid. It mnst be borne in mind, however, tliat this may 
or may not be so of a case of nepliritis. In acute ne])hritis the 
urine Ls a fairly accurate gnide, improvement in the kidney con- 
dition being usnally indicated })y a diminution of the albumin 
and ol blood in the urine, and bv an increase in the amount of 



DIET IN DISEASES OF GENITO-UBINARY SYSTEM. 537 

urine excreted. In subacute conditions the same may hold true, 
whereas in chronic nepln'itis the variations in the amount of 
albumin are most untrustworthy guides as to the patient's con- 
dition. A mere change in the diet, whethcT from a meat to a 
milk diet, or any otlier decided change, may be followed by an 
increase in the amount of albumin for some days. There are 
also variations in the amount of albumin excreted that are due 
to influences not as yet understood. 

The patient's temperature is also a good guide as to the suita- 
bility of a diet. As Emerson says, '^ Variations of an acute 
process in the course of a chronic one arc shown by an increase 
in the percentage of albumin and a slight rise in tempera- 
ture.'' 

Points to be borne in mind are that the amount of albumin 
for twenty-four hours must always be estimated ; that the ])er- 
centage is to be compared with other observations made on the 
same patient, and that the percentage of albumin is increiised 
as water is taken in lessened amounts. 

As regards the actual excretory power of the kidneys, there 
are no means at present of easily or accurately estimating it. 

The general condition of the patient is one of the best 
guides as to the suitability of a method of treatment, but the 
prognosis can be made only by a skilled physician of great 
experience. 

One of the first principles in the dieting of patients with 
kidney disease is to avoid giving substances that are irritating 
to the renal epithelium. Many injurious articles of diet are 
known by the fact that they uniformly produce bad eifects. A 
second group, founded on studies on metabolism, has been added 
by von Xoorden. He ascert^\ined which end-products were 
excreted easily and which with difficulty, and advises the avoid- 
ance of substances tliat are broken up into end-products that are 
difficult of excretion. 

In the first class are included grills and roasts, especially the 
browned outer surface of these, strong sauces, pastry, spices of 
all kinds, very acid foods, strong alcoholic drinks, t^a, and 
coffee. 

Von Noorden ^ gives the following list of substances excreted 
with ease or with difficulty in acute, subacute, and in exacerba- 
tions in chronic nephritis. He states, however, that these 
observations require further study and consideration : 

* Von Noorden, Ctinical Treatises on the I'afholog'y and Therapy of Disorden 
of Metabolism and Nutrition, Part II., Nephritis.

Excreted with Difficulty. Easily Excreted. 

Urea. Uric acid.

Pigments. Aromatic substances. 

Hii)puric acid. Amido-acids. 

Phosphates. Carbonates. 

Inorganic sulphates. Water (see below). 
Potassium salts. 
Water (see below). 

Early in the disease water is excreted with great difficulty — 
with more difficulty than even urea. As soon as improvement 
sets in, however, it is easily gotten rid of. The difficulty prob- 
ably lies in the mechanical interference with its excretion, 
owing to the great distention of the blood-vessels caused by 
the severe congestion. 

It is necessary next to notice briefly the articles of diet that 
give rise to the diffisrent end-products just mentioned. 

Creatinin is derived from creatin, which is present in meat- 
extracts and in meat broths. Traces are also found in the 
white and in the yolk of eggs and in meat. It is not present 
in vegetables. 

Urinary Fignients. — Little is known concerning these. They 
are all probably derived from hemoglobin, and there is no way 
of controlling hemoglobin metabolism by restricting the diet. 
Substances containing hemoglobin may, however, be omitted 
from the diet. 

FhoHphoric Acid. — This is present in large quantities in meat, 
yolk of eggs, milk, and many Yegetal)les. Milk is the principal 
food to be considered here, as it is used extensively and con- 
tains large quantities of the acid. Von Noorden suggests the 
use of calcium carbonate to overcome this acidity in the patients 
on a milk diet. 

Urea and SulpJiafes. — These are both derived from albumin. 
The important point to remember is the fact that the amount 
of protein ingested may be reduced to a very small quantity if, 
at the same time, corresponding quantities of carbohydrates and 
fat are administered. Von Xoorden gives about a liter and a 
half of milk daily, and usunllv adds a quarter of a liter of 
cream to it. lie warns against the excessive use of fat in 
nephritis. Amylaceous soups or gruels are adde<l to the diet 
wliere necessary. 

Ilippurie AcUl. — This is derived fnnn compounds (benzoic 
esters) tliat are containtnl in green vegetables, fruits with ker- 
nels, and cranl)erries. Thes(^ should be avoided in acute in- 



DIET IN DfSKASES OF GENITO-URINARY SYSTEM. o39 

flammatory processes in tlie kidneys. Small quantities are, 
however, found in such i'ruits as pears, ap[)les, and many ber- 
ries, particularly raspberries, and in grapes. These fruits and 
juices made from them may be given in ne})hritis. 

Aedic Acid and Citric Acid. — Von Noorden ^ says : "There 
is an old po]:>ular prejudice to the effect that acetic acid should 
be alt<)gether eliminated from the diet of ])atients suffering from 
renal disease, from lithiasis, and from bladder troubles.'^ Citric 
acid as contained in lemon-juice has been rcconunended as a 
substitute for acetic acid. A^on Noorden states that there is no 
theoretic or practical objection to the use of vinegar in diseases 
of kidney, bladder, or urethra, and that he has never seen the 
slightest harm result from its use. 

Uric Acid and the Xantkin BancH. — These are relatively well 
excreted. They are, however, toxic, and under certain condi- 
tions their elimination may be retarded. In all forms of neph- 
ritis it is, therefore, advisable to withhold all such foods as 
favor the formation of alloxuric bodies. These are all animal 
tissues rich in nuclein, — especially glands, — such as sweetbreads, 
liver, spleen, kidney, and strong meat broths. 

Muscle meat, of course, contains some nuclein, but not 
sufficient to justify its exclusion from the diet on these 
grounds. 

Von Noorden and others have determined, as the result of 
careful experimentation, that there is no difference in the light 
and dark meats as regards the effects of their end-products on 
the kidneys. This is in direct variance with the time-honored 
view, but it is apparently based on uncontrovertible facts. 

Alcohol. — Little is known in regard to the excretion of alco- 
hol by diseased kidneys. Alcohol, whether taken in the form 
of the strong or of the weaker alcoholic beverages, is known to 
act as one of the worst of poisons to the kidneys. That it 
irritates the kidneys directly, there can be no doubt ; but it is 
also true that a certain amount of alcohol will be eliminated by 
healthy kidneys without harm to them. This amount probablv 
varies with different individuals and can not be definitely fixed. 
The amount that will prove injurious to diseased kidneys is 
undoubtedly smaller than for healthy kidneys. Ordinarily, 
alcohol should be strictly avoided, but there are cases in which 
it may be used with great benefit. Attacks of cardiac weak- 
ness and a small, thready pulse may be successfully combated 
by small, repeated doses. In certain cases where there is 

^ Loc. eit. 



640 DIET IN DISEASE, 

nausea, food may be retained when small quantities of wine or 
diluted brandy or whisky are given. 

Alcohol is contained in kefir and kumiss, which are used in 
large quantities by physicians who would not prescribe it in 
any of the stronger forms. 

Water. — AVater may be used freely, as a rule, as soon as 
diuresis improves. It is the best diiu"etic that can be used 
under ordinary conditions. With increased diuresis there is 
increase in the amount of solids excreted. This may not, how- 
ever, be the case with certain patients. 

According to von Noorden, water should be given in limited 
amounts when the kidneys refuse to excrete it ; in cases where 
diuresis is not increased by water-drinking ; and in cases where 
the water ingested serves only to augment the edema and hy- 
dremia 

ACUTE NEPHRITIS. 

Von Noorden's suggestions regarding the dietetic manage- 
ment and care of acute nephritis are not entirely in accord with 
the views expressed by most authorities. Since they are the 
result of scientific observations and conclusions drawn from his 
own clinical practice, however, they are worthy of consideration. 

(a) In Severe Cases where the Secretion of the Urine is greatly 
Reduced. — In these cases, where the edema is increasing and 
where uremia threatens, the amount of food and drink should 
be limited to the smallest possible quantity — say about a half 
liter of milk a day. For the intense thirst water, in table- 
spoonful doses, may be given, or what is usually better, ice may 
be given to quench the thirst. The surplus water in the tissues 
should be removed by sweating. When the heart is failing and 
the pulse is small and thready, brandy or whisky may be admin- 
istered in small frequent doses. Such a diet can not ordinarily 
be maintained for more than four or five days without -seri- 
ously impairing the strengh, but usually at the end of this time 
the ])atient has either improved or succumbed to the disease. 

(h) Cases in which the Kccrrfion of Water is Reduced, hut in 
vihich Anuria does not Thredten Life. — In these cases, where 
there is moderate edema, von Noorden gives chiefly milk — a 
liter and a half daily, to which he adds a})out 350 c.c. of sweet 
cream. If the patient demands more food, or if his strength is 
mu(;h reduced so that increased feeding is desirable, he adds 
rice, groats, corn-meal })(>rridge, crackers or zwieback, and 
eterilized grape-juice or other fruit syrups. His diet consists 



DIET IN DISEASES OF GENITO-lJRrXARY SYSTEM. 541 

of 1500 gm. of milk, 375 gm. of cream, 50 gm. of rice, 
50 gm. of zwieback, 50 gm. of butter, and 20 gm. of sugar, 
the total heat- value of which is 2900 calories. This is equiv- 
alent to 4 or 5 liters of milk. 

A strict milk diet has been recommended by some in these 
cases, but the best clinicians follow the outline just given. 
While the process is active, too nmch milk nmst not be given, 
and what is given should be properly diluted, preferably with a 
carbonated water. As soon as the acute ])r()cess begins to sub- 
side the diet may be increased by the additi(3n of rice and other 
cereals, bread and water, fruit, and, later on, as convalescence 
begins to be established, meat may be added. The appetite and 
digestion must regulate the increase in diet. In addition to the 
foregoing, very weak meat broths may be allowcfi, veal or 
chicken usually agreeing better with digestion than the others. 
If preferred, however, weak beef, or mutton broth may be 
given. Strong meat broths and beef-teas are to be prohibited. 
Sugar and cocoa may also be allowed. 

If the digestion is very good, butter and other fats may be 
permitted in moderate quantities. Calves'-foot jelly and similar 
preparations may be allowed, as well as light vegetables, the 
best being spinach, cauliflower tops, young peas, or young 
string-beans. These vegetables are to be added as convalescence 
begins to be established and a desire for other food returns. 

As a general rule the patient^ s appetite, if he has any, is the 
best guide as to the amount of food to be allowed. Too nmch 
will not be taken, and as the disease is generally of short dura- 
tion, the reverse is also true. During convalescence the appe- 
tite may be stimulated by dilute hydrochloric acid or bitter 
tonics. 

As to beverages, water, plain or carbonated, mineral waters, 
fruit-juice and water (lemonade, etc.), and, for weak patients, 
water and wine or water and whisky or brandy, in small quan- 
tities may be permitted. If the ])atient prefers milk, from four 
to seven pints may be given daily, diluted w^ith a ciirbonatod 
water. If it causes diarrhea, lime-water should be added to the 
milk, or if there is constipation magnesia solution or citrate of 
magnesia may be given instead. If the liver symptoms appear, 
the milk may be skimmed or buttermilk substituted. If the 
stomach becomes disordered, kumiss may be given in place of 
milk, or rice, barley, or arrow-root gruel may be substituted for 
it. If vomiting occurs, the stomach should be given complete 
rest, after which carbonated water may be allowed. A favorite 



542 DIET IN DISEASE, 

driak under these conditions, or in fact at any time in the 
course of an acute nephritis, is the imperial drink, made by 
dissolving a dram of cream of tartar in a pint of boiling 
water and adding the juice of half a lemon and a little sugar ; 
this should be given cold. 

If the course of the disease is slow, and the condition sub- 
chronic, the diet must be increased or the patient's strength will 
fail. In these cases small amounts of meat may be added to 
the dietary. The effect on the urine and the temperature must 
be carefully watched. If there is marked disturbance, the 
meat should be discontinued and then repeated after several 
days. The general condition of the patient is a safe guide, and 
he must not be allowed to starve to death because a small 
amount of albumin appears in his urine. 

CHRONIC PARENCHYMATOUS NEPHRITIS. 

In this disease the patient's mode of life must be carefully 
regulated. The amount of exercise and the diet demand par- 
ticular attention. From the beginning all irritating articles of 
food are to be withheld. Secondly, the amount of protein 
should be limited, and the deficiency supplied by carbohydrates 
and fwi. 

It was formerly believed necessary to replace the albumin 
lost in the urine. In chronic nephritis but a few grams are lost 
daily, and this is readily compensated for by the ingestion of 
250 c.c. of milk or 40 to 50 grams of meat. The limiting of 
the protein nuist not be carried to extremes. Starvation may 
take place from giving either too little or the same form too 
constantly. No hard-and-fast rule can be laid down as to the 
restriction of protein, as every case is a law unto itself, varying 
with the occupation, the anKjunt of rest, and the stage of the 
disease. Such conditions require the judgment born of ex- 
perience. 

Senator gives the following figures, from Voit, for a middle- 
aged, unemployed man suffering from chronic nephritis : 

Piotein So grams. 

Fat HO " 

(Carbohydrates 300 " 

The whole jj;ives 1860 calories. 

The average case can probably get along Mitli less protein 
than 85 grams daily, and Senator suggests the following : 



DIET IN DISEASES OF GENITO-URIXARY^ SYSTEM. 543 

Protein, 50 to 70 grams daily, or the amount contained in 
1 J to '1\ liters of milk, or in 250 to o50 grams of milk, or in 
from 8 to 10 eggs. 

Carbohydrates, 400 to 500 grams, or a corresponding amount 
of fat (100 grams of fat, 240 grams of carbohydrates — 2100 
calories, or 300 more than Voit gives for a healthy man not 
working). 

In severe cases, where there are edema, little albumin, and 
many casts in the urine, the amount of protein must be cut 
down to from 30 to 40 grams, or what is etiual to 1 liter of 
milk, or 200 grams of lean meat, or G eggs. When the condi- 
tion improves, the figures may be doubled. 

During acute exacerbations the patient may be put on an ab- 
solute milk diet for from one to two weeks, with most excellent 
results in many cases. At least two liters should be given daily, 
diluted, when necessary, with carbonated water or lime-water. 
If there is a tendency to diarrhea or to constij)ation, or if 
meteorism occurs, lime-water is to be preferred. Buttermilk 
may be substituted for sweet milk when constipation occurs, or 
if the patient prefers it. Kumiss and kefir are valuable addi- 
tions to the diet. The small amount of alcohol these foods 
contain is ordinarily no contraindication to their use. 

The return to a general diet should be made gradually. Fat 
in the form of cream and butter may be added. Sugar, fruit 
syrups, jellies, and compotes may be given, using especially 
apples, pears, or raspberries. Carbohydrates in the form of milk, 
gruels, and cereals, as well as toast, zwieback, and bread not too 
fresh, may be eaten. Sago and tapioca are valuable additions, 
and potatoes may also be allowed. Meat may be added in mod- 
erate quantities, care being taken to note the eifect. The white 
meat of chicken is usually recommended at first, but recent 
investigations have failed to show any different results from the 
use of light and of dark meats. The outer surface of roasts and 
browned meats is to be avoided. 

In Germany almond milk (Emulsio amygdalorum) is used ex- 
tensively. The various infant and invalid foods may be mixed 
with the milk. Coffee and tea or cocoa may be allowed. Alco- 
hol is prohibited, except as needed in special cases. 

Salt-free Diet. — The average daily diet contains about 
1 gram of sodium chlorid in the original composition of the 
food, and from 10 to 20 are added daily as seasoning. Ob- 
servers differ concerning the influence of low^ salt diet in nephri- 
tis, and various patients react differently, but many are greatly 
improved. There are numerous theories regarding this subject. 



544 DIET IN DISEASE. 

One is that the retention of the chloric! is due to the condition 
of the kidney itself, and second, that the retention is a simple 
physical process entirely secondary to the rentention of water 
in the body, and the third, that the tissues are in some way 
altered, so that they are able to hold in combination a larger 
amount of salt than usual. Widal and Lemierre found that by 
adding salt to the diet of a patient suffering with ])arenchymatous 
nephritis they could increase the edema, if it was present, or 
produce it if it was not. This led to the reduction of the quan- 
tity of salt taken by edematous patients, and in some instances 
rather remarkable results were obtained. A great many of the 
unpleasant symptoms associated with nephritis, and which may 
be due to what might be called latent edema, where there is 
water in the tissues which has not reached the stage of being 
visible in the subcutaneous tissues, may be greatly improved by 
a salt-free diet. This latent edema may be detected and fol- 
lowed by systematic weighing of the patient, an increase of 
weight meaning that the kidneys have become more impermeable 
to the chlorids. Somewhat similar results have been obtained 
in the edema due to heart disease, and it is possible that in as- 
cites it might be of value. Lermoyez claims to have benefitted 
tinnitus auriuni, especially that occurring in Bright's disease, 
and Jacquet has had favorable results in chronic obstructive 
nasal catarrh occurring in nephritis. 

In cases where there is constant thirst, the salt-free diet is 
often of benefit, the sipping of water at short intervals is avoided, 
the mouth becomes moist and more comfortable. It is a good 
plan to omit the salt cellar from the table or tray, and if no 
effect is noted the quantity of salt put in the food during its 
preparation should be greatly reduced or omitted altogether. 

CHRONIC INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS. 

Cases of this disease require especial study, and the nature 
of the individual and the stage of the disease must be taken 
into consideration. Care should l)e taken to avoid acute attacks. 

Early cases, wliere there is no ])()lyuria, where the heart and 
vessels are ncjt seriously affected, and where there is little albumin 
in the urine, are frequently much improved by a course of treat- 
ment similar to that prescribed in acute nephritis. The patient 
should be kept in bed on a milk diet. If after two weeks there 
is no improvement, this treatment may be abandoned. 

Acute exacerbations are to be managed as when they occur in

acute iie])hritis. Ordinaril}', howcvci-, one lias to dral with a

years. As cure is out of the (juestion, the (hc't shouhl l)e so 
arranged as to give the greatest degree otComl'ort atid allow tlu* 
fr(H3Ht activity compatible with the stage of the di-case. The

be allowed to continue liis ordinary avocation. If care is taken 
to avoid excesses of all kinds, many of these j)atieiit- ai'e able 
to work for years. 

The kidney shoidd be prot^n^ed as nuieh as possible, and all 
irritatina: food and drink, as mentioned at the bcLnnniuLi of thi- 
section, should l)e avoided. The heart must be .-pared and 
strengthened, and the patient's general health maintained, 'i'he 
restriction of diet, however, need not be so rigorous as In the 
acute cases. 

When the case is hopeless, the diet nuiy be left to the ta-ie 
of the patient and the ingenuity of the nurse, and the la.-t weeks 
or days made as enjoyable as ])ossible. 

Too nuich stre^ss should not be laid on the amount of albumin 
or of solid matters contained in the mine, as many variations 
occur that are not dependent on the diet. 

In the selection of a diet alcohol deserves >peeial mention. 
Total abstinence is the rule ! Under no circumstances -honld 
the patient be allowed any form of alcoholic drink as a beNcrage. 
He should be made to understand that if he uses alcohol in any 
form he Is doing so at his own risk. There are cases, however, 
in wdiich alcohol is absolutely necessary. In old alcoholics tlieiv 
may be attacks of weak lieart or complete anorexia if the stim- 
ulant is withdrawn at once; in these cases It may be allowed in 
small amounts. A"on Noorden uses it even In late cases to pre- 
vent attacks of uremic cardiac asthma. He is also firm in regard 
to his position on the use of alcohol in chronic interstitial ne])h- 
ritls, and states that lie is more j)artleular about Its u-e in chronic 
ne])hritis than in acute. 

Spices of all kinds, celerv, and ])ossiblv a-nai'agn^ and nui-h- 
rooms as well, should be forbidden in all cases. \^on Xoorden 
allows a moderate amount of asparagus two or three time.- a 
W'eek during the season, but warns against using it in excess. 
This same observer includes in his list of drugs that ari' danger- 
ous in atrophic nephritis — cantharidin, copaiba, turpentine, sali- 
cylic acid, carbolic acid, resorcin, hydroipiinon, lead, coj)p(M-, 
boric acid, silver and mercury and their .<alts, iodoform, and tar 
preparations. In this disease it is well to be cautious in the 
use of all drugs. Owing to its chroniclty, and to the frequent 
occurrence of intercurrent affections, drugs are a})t to be used to 

35 



546 DIET IN DISEASE. 

a greater extent than in any other disease. It is also true that 
most drugs are excreted more slowly than in health. 

Tea, coffee, and tobacco are ordinarily to be forbidden, but 
may be allowed in small quantities if they do not exert an inju- 
rious effect upon the heart. Careful observations should be 
made as to the effect upon the pulse-rate and strength, upon the 
strength and character of the heart impulse, and upon the sub- 
jective sensations. 

Meat may be allowed in as great a variety as possible. The 
so-called high game and all rich meats and complicated dishes 
are to be avoided. Either light or dark meats may be allowed, 
as the appetite is, as a rule, poor, the amount of protein to be 
taken may usually be left largely to the patient. xV list of 
articles of food allowed may be given, and he may be permitted 
to arrange his menu himself in most cases. Where the appetite 
is normal, however, the amount of nitrogenous food should be 
limited, and diet-lists containing small amounts of protein food 
furnished the patient. In view of Chittenden's experiments on 
healthy individuals it would seem advisable to try diets with 
the protein as low as 60 gm. of protein daily for a patient 
weighing 70 kilos. This would reduce the excretion of nitro- 
gen to 8 or 9 gm. daily. Von Noorden, averaging a series of 
cases covering five years' experience, found that for 70 kilos of 
body weight, the nitrogen ingested in the males was from 13 to 
16 gm., and in the females from 11 to 14 gm. If expressed in 
albumin, men, 81 to 100 gm. ; women, 69 to 87 gm. Making 
allowance for the amount in the feces, the quantity of albumin 
taken was for the men 92 to 112 gm., and for the women 80 to 
1 00 gm. Based on these figures he gives an average diet as con- 
taining milk, 750 c.c. ; 2 eggs ; bread and vegetables ; meat, 
men, 215 to 315 gm. weighed raw; women, 155 to 255 gm. 
weighed raw. Variations may be made to suit the condition of 
the patient. 

The amount of water to be allowed should be c^irefully deter- 
mined. Ordinarily the ])atients are encouraged to take water, 
milk, and diuretic drinks. Von Xoorden warns against this 
practice, arguing that i\\Q variations in the jiercentage of albu- 
min in the urine are valueless in estimating the course of the 
disease, and that the heart may be very much damaged by the 
extra work thrown upon it })y the use of excessive amounts of 
water. The fluid absorbed from the intestinal tract must ordi- 
narily be excreted through the kidneys, and this means in- 
cre^ised blood-pressure and increased work for the heart. Von 
Noorden limits the amount of fluid t<^d<en to about one and one- 
quarter liters. This includes all kinds of fluid taken. The 



DIET IN DISEASES OF aEMTO-ErjyARY SYSTEM. 547 

water taken in the solid I'ood — iisiiallv l'n»ni ."^>(H) to 700 c.c. 
daily — may be disreo-inh^d. \\c admits that the amount the 
])atient usually takes should he (htci-miiicd hy two or three 
days' observation, and then that this amount be <;i-adiially cut 
down from 250 to 150 c.r. a day until the desired (juantity is 
reached. One day a week the patient is allowed a '' drinking 
day/' on Avhieh all the water desired ma\- be taken. It is 
found that excretion of the solid contents of the ui-ine takes 
plaec just as rapidly with this i-estricted amount of water as 
before, and that in case the excretion is not (piite .-o i^ood, the 
one-day-a-week tiushing kce{)s the oi-n-anisui rea>onably cl<an. 
In some patients every two or three months two or three liters 
a day are allowed daily for two weeks. If there is failini;- com- 
j)ensation, the iiushing-out should not be resorted to, nor should 
it be allowed if there is appreciable dilatation of the left heart. 
The desire ibr water is greatly lessened by placing the jtatient 
ou a salt-free or a comparatively sodium-chlorid-free diet, as 
suggested for chronic parenchymatous nephritis. 

Care shonld be taken not to allow patients who have a lean- 
ing toward obesity too much carbohydrate material. This is 
frequently done in cases of contracted kidmy^, usually with bad 
results. On the other hand, in thin patients, if tluTc is no 
attendant dyspepsia, a diet rich in carbohydrates may very 
greatly improve the ])atient\s condition. 

Exercise, fresh air, freedom from care and worry, suitable 
oceuj)ation, and pleasant sm*roundings are all essential fact(M's 
in the treatment, and shoidd not be neglected. A change oi'air 
to a dry, w^arm, equable climate is often of great benefit. 

FLOATING KIDNEY, 
In this condition t^vo things are to b(^ es])ecially recom- 
mended — viz., rest and food. The diet should be one that will 
cause the patient to take on as much flesh as j^ossible. ^Fany 
cases of movable kidney come on in nervous individuals who 
have lost flesh, and when the fat normally surrounding the 
kidney is replaced, the organ no longer floats about. The 
rest cure is especially recommended in those cases that occur 
in nervotis people who have lost flesh rapidly. Time and 
patience are required, and the treatment often fails because it is 
not persisted in for a sufficiently long time. In cases of long 
standing a diet similar to that recommended in gastroptosis 
and enteroptosis should be prescribed. 



548 DIET IN DISEASE. 

AMYLOID KIDNEY. 
This condition requires a supporting diet of good food, and 
measures directed toward removing the cause of the amyloid 
disease. 

PYELITIS— PYELONEPHRITIS. 

The diet in these conditions should be very bland and non- 
irritating. The substances and foods previously mentioned as 
irritating should all be avoided. Milk, buttermilk, almond 
milk, and the like, should form the bulk of the diet. Milk- 
toast, gruels, and cereals may also be given. If the heart is 
strong, an abundance of fluid may be allowed in order to flush 
out the kidneys ; alkaline mineral waters and flaxseed tea are 
among the best for this purpose. Care should be taken that 
the patient receives sufficient protein daily. Increase of diet 
may be made along the same lines as are indicated in acute 
nephritis. 

RENAL AND VESICAL CALCULI. 

The diet as a cause of stone, especially of the uric acid variety, 
has been the subject of much controversy. In children it has 
been stated that the formation of stone usually follows a poor 
and insufficient milk supply. Ordinarily it may be said that 
too rich food, too large meals, and an inactive life are the most 
])otent causative factors. Certain individuals are prone to 
calculus-formation. 

The following suggestions regarding the diet will be found 
useful : Forbid strong drinks, and all alcohol if possible ; much 
meat, and especially the miclein-containing meats, as thymus, 
spleen, liver, brain ; caviare, etc., smoked, pickled and spiced 
meats, and rich foods in general. The fats and sugars, as well 
as the cereals, should be restricted. The diet should be made 
up of the plainer, well-prepared foods, and, as far as possible, a 
vegetable diet should be prescribed. Water, es})ecially the 
alkaline mineral waters, may be allowed in abundance. A 
sojourn at Carlsbad may be recommended for certain obese 
patients. When alkaline mineral waters are given for acid 
stones, they should be used only so long as the urine remains 
acid. If it becomes alkaline, the waters should be discontinued, 
lest phosphates be deposited on existing stones. 

LITHEML\. THE SO-CALLED URIC ACID DIATHESIS. 

The factors in the causation of this disease are heredity, a too 
abundant and a too ri(;h diet, and an inactive life. It may be

ro^ardwl as an irreirular inrm of o(ni(. At pivsciit th(^ views con-

connnent. The condition is n>nall\' iiianircsted i)V iniurainc^, 
iicural<iia, sick headache, skin eruptions, and the like. 

The diet is tlie })i'incipal iactor in the treatment, and scarcely 
of less importance are ("roh air and exercise. It is moi'e com- 
mon among the well-to-do in wititer, lor ont-ofnloor life in 
summer nstially means more or less nearly perfect metabolism. 

The diet should he sinn'hir to that outlined el.-ewhere for the 
gouty. A reduction in the (piantity of food taken, e>peciailv 
of the protein sup])ly, and an avoidance of alcohol and i"ich, 
complex foods are the principal indications. (See (Joul.) 

The following is the dietary which Sir II. Thompson recom- 
mends in calculous affections : 

" Fish in all its forms, except those containing much fatty 
matter — i. e., herrings, mackerel, eels, and the thin part of 
salmon. Game in all f /rms. Poultry. JjO'aw meat in moder- 
ate quantity. Preparations of gelatin, savory jdly, <»r j<'lly 
agreeably flavored, but unsweetened, linlter in moderation 
(this is the only direct form of fat admitted, fat in some Ibrm 
being necessary). An egir <>i' two, on account of their useful- 
ness in all cooking operations. (The objection to ('u:(^> applies 
only to tlie yolks. Milk in strict moderation, and onlv with 
tea, coffee, or cocoa. It is very undesirable and noxious in 
large quantity, as it contains a large ])roportion of fat and sugar, 
and its casein is digested with difficulty. it is le>s objection- 
al)le when thoroughly skimmed. \\ ell-made whole-meal bread. 
Oatmeal. Pearl barley. ^Macaroni and other Ttalian pastes. 
Some coarse meal is needed to act as an aperient and j.revent 
constipation. Whole-meal l)rea<l is im])roved in flavor and 
texture by an admixture of fine (not coarse) Scot^'h oiitmeal, in 
the pro})ortion of about one-cpiarter to one-third of the wheat- 
meal em})loyed. 

'^ Dry haricots and lentils are most nutritious vegetabh\'^, and 
should be taken made into purees. They are digested with 
ease and contain much nutritious matter. Rice, sago, tnpioca, 
and arrow-root are all useful if treat<Hl as savory dishes, and 
not as sweets. Fresh green vegetables are especiiilly g(K-)d. 
Fresh green peas and broad beans, well masticated. Light 
salads are permissible to persons \\ho digest them e^isily, l)ut 
they must not be tiiken by those who digest them with diflfi- 
culty. Celery, sea-kale, asparagus, tomatoes, potatoes, and 
artichokes are all permitted ; so also are apples, roasted or 
baked, without added sugar. 



550 DIET IN DISEASE. 

"The following are to be avoided: rhubarb^ gooseberries, 
currants, strawberries, raspberries, grapes, phims, pears, and all 
sweet fruit, fresh or preserved. Saccharin may be substituted 
for sugar/^ 

lyithemia in Children. — This is most often seen in the 
children of gouty parents. It is manifested usually in more 
or less periodic attacks of sick headache, nausea, vomiting, or 
neuralgic attacks. Children so afflicted are usually quick and 
bright, and of tlie nervous type. There is apt to be a dry 
scaly skin, and a tendency to eczema and to what Louis Starr 
calls a roseolous eruption. The latter observer gives the follow- 
ing suggestions for dieting such children : 

'^Treatment. — Little can be accomplished in the relief of 
lithemia without careful regulation of the diet. 

" In breast-fed infants this is difficult to accomplish, l)ut the 
milk must be analyzed, and any abnormal condition corrected, 
as far as possible, by attention to the mother's feeding, exer- 
cise, and general hygiene, and by the employment, in her case, 
of an antilithic treatment. 

'^ AVheii the feeding is artificial, a home-modified cows'-milk 
mixture of proper average composition for the case in hand 
should be employed, and variations made in the proportion of 
cream and milk as the symptoms demand. Poland water, as 
it increases the activity of the kidneys, is a better diluent than 
plain water, and if the digestion will not permit of the addi- 
tion of sufficient cream to maintain a free action of the bowels, 
from one to five grains of sodium ])hosphate may be added to 
each bottle of f jod. For children of four years a suitable 
diet is : 

'' Flrd Meal, 8 A. M. — Milk, 7 fluidounces ; Vichy water, 
1 fluidounce (one or two i^ortions) ; one or two yolks of soft- 
boiled eggs with salt, or a bit of fresh fish or sweetbread; or 
one or two slices of ham or whole-wheat bread, dry. 

" Second Meal, l.oO P. M. — A teacupful of clear meat broth ; 
a bit of chicken, turkey, wii 1 fowl, or fish ; one well-cooked 
green vegetable — i. e., s])inach, celery, young onions, cauli- 
flower ; one or two slices of dry bran or whole- wheat bread ; 
junket or rice-and-milk })udding ; cooked fruit with very little 
sugar. 

'' Third Meaf, OJVl P. M. — Milk at first meal ; sweetbread 
or milk-toast ; dry bran or whole-wheat bread. 

*' For drink, Poland water or Vichy (dome^stic) ; use either 
freely. Avoid fats, starches, sweets, raw fruits, and red meats 
— i. e., beef or mutton. 



DIET IN DISEASES OE GENrrO-URINARY SYSTEM. 551 

''In still older patients — ten years and npward — a wider 
range is permissible, and the meals may be seleeted from the 
following; list, which gives the foods allowed, as well as those 
to be avoided : 

'' Breakfast. — Milk, salted, if desired ; weak eoeoa with very 
little sngar. Bran bread ; whole-wheat bread ; diy toast ; 
zwieback. Oatmeal or cracked wheat porridge, w(^ll co;)ked, 
with salt and milk. Kggs — V^^lk of soft-boiled or poached ; 
French omelet. Chicken broiled. Fresh hsh : rockfish, perch, 
bass (no oily fish). 

'' Dinner. — Oysters (in season), sonp ; beef, mntton, or lamb ; 
poultry or game, small quantity (roasted or broiled, and one 
kind only). Two green vegetables : spinach, celery, peas, string- 
beans, cauliflower, onion, turnips, vegetable marrow, okra, 
parsnips, carrots, egg-plant, tomatoes raw or baked. Rice, 
hominy, or macaroni (cooked plain). Bread as above. T^ight 
pudding : apples baked with very little sugar ; stewed apples ; 
stewed prunes ; grapes in moderatiou ; melons. 

^^ Supper. — ]Milk or cocoa as at breakfast ; bread as above ; 
toast or zwieback ; chickeu or game (roasted or broiled) ; oys- 
ters (in season) stewed or roasted ; fresh flsh ; sweetbread, 
stewed ; one green vegetable as above ; cooked fruit, with very 
little sugar. 

" Lithia water to be taken freely. No food between meals. 
Supper two hours before retiring for the night. If nuich sugar 
is demanded with food, saccharin, is to be employed as a sub- 
stitute. 

'^Articles to be avoided: Cream. White of Qgu: ; eggs 
cooked with milk. Crabs, lobsters ; salmon and all rich, oily 
fish. Veal, ])ork, ham ; dried, smoked or pickled meats of all 
sorts ; twice-cooked meats. All fried food. Pastry, cake, 
hot bread or rolls, confectionery of all sorts, jams, jellies. 
Rhubarb, beets, cabbage, old peas, old beans, potatoes (white 
or sweet), asparagus, radishes ; all raw fruits (except as men- 
tioned above), especially strawberries, raspberries, and pears. 
Fruit cooked with much sugar, dried fruit (figs, dates), nuts. 
Mushrooms. Pickles, vinegar, spices, condiments (salt excepted). 

"The object of both of the diets given is to allow a minimum 
of albuminous food, to diminish the formation of uric acid and 
itvS analogues, and a minimum of carbohydrates (sugar and 
starch) to afford the albuminoid waste an opportunity of being 
freely oxidized. From the two lists it is not dilHcult to formu- 
late a diet for intervening ages. 



552 DIET IN DISEASE. 

^'During the obstinate vomiting of the gastro-intestinal form 
everything taken into the stomach may be rejected ; still the 
prostration caused by the attack is diminished if the patient be 
forced to take one or two teaspoonfuls of raw-beef juice at 
regular periods, every two hours, for example, with sips of 
water, or, better, white-of-egg water in the intervals. At the 
same time rectal injections of peptonized milk or Ijroth must be 
administered. These enemata sliould not exceed two fluid- 
ounces in quantity at the age of three years, should be given at 
a tem})erature of 98^ F., and at intervals of four hours; and 
once daily the rectum must be washed clean with warm normal 
saline solution (one teaspoonful of table salt to one pint of 
water).'^ 

GONORRHEA, 

The diet in this disease is (jf considerable importance. Im« 
proper food and drink not only serve to prolong the disease, 
but overindulgences in forbidden articles may cause a return of 
the discharge even after the disease has apparently been cured. 

The directions for diet are very simple. All irritating foods 
and drinks should be avoided, as should all indigestible articles. 
The diet should consist of plain and wholesome food. Where 
it is possible, skim-milk should form the basis of the diet. Too 
much meat should not be taken, and twice-cooked meats and 
fried and very greasy foods avoided as far as possible. Carbo- 
hydrates, as breadstufl^'s, cereals, and the non-acid vegetables, 
may be aHowed. Care should be taken to avoid all complicated 
and highly seasoned foods, all pepper, spices, and salad dress- 
ings. In a word, everything previously mentioned as irritat- 
ing to the genito-urlnary tract should be avoided. Acid fruits, 
asparagus, and tomatoes are also to be forbidden. Tea and 
coffee should be })rohibited or given very weak and well diluted 
with milk or cream. All alcoholic drinks should be forbidden. 
AVhen the ])atient must drink, in order to avoid sus])icion, claret 
has been recommended as le<ist irritating, but even tliis is best 
avoided. 

An abundance of ])lain or effervescing water should be taken, 
but not in sufficient (juantities to disturb digestion. It is best 
to drink the water between meals and on an empty stomach. 
Flaxseed tea and similar demulcent drinks may be lielpful. 

Tobacco may be jdlowed habitues, but not in excess. Mod- 
erate smoking in those accustomed to the habit is regarded as 
beneficial rather than as harmful. 



DIET IN DISEASES OE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 553 

DIET IN DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, 

The necessity for the correet inaiiuij^eineiit of the diet in 
nervous diseases is beeoniino appreciated more and more every 
vear. As a general rule it may be stated that all functional 
diseases attended with emaciation are greatly benefited, if not 
entirely relieved, merely by increasing the })atient's weight by 
such methods as are suggested under the heading of Rest Cure. 
Patients with chronic organic lesions will, as a rule, be made 
more comfortable if the following two points are borne in mind. 
First, to overcome, so far as possible, emaciati(Hi and anemia 
where the nutrition has a tendency to be below normal; and, 
secondly, and of no slighter importance, to ])revent undue obesity 
in those so inclined, particularly where there is disturbance 
of locomotion. A patient may be condemned to remain in bed 
or in a chair on account of the excessive weight whi(^h his inac- 
tivity has fostertd. For further particulars on this subject the 
student is referred to the section on Obesity. 

Most patients regard diet as a very unimportant part of the 
treatment ; this is true especially of those cases that most need 
careful feeding. The necessity for careful dietary should be im- 
pressed upon these patients, and a faith in its efticacy engendered 
where the disease is of a functional nature. 

The diet suitable in nervous diseases has been the subject of 
many diverse opinions, particularly in the minds of the laity. 
Fish has been vaunted as a " brain food,^' and various fats or 
cereals have been suggested for nervous conditions. At the 
present time, it may be stated, there is no s])ecific " nerve f »od." 
The nutrition of the nervous system will be good wlu^n the 
patient's general nutrition is good, and ?-/Vr rer.sd. Both in 
functional disorders of the nervous system and in the jisychoses 
dependent upon exhaustion the improvement of the general 
condition should be the first care. 

The basis of the diet, which will be outlined later, is usually 
milk. Care siiould be taken to see that the patient gets suffi- 
cient fluid, and where no tendency to obesity exists, water 
should be taken with each meal and usually at bedtime and on 
rising. It may also be taken between meals if desired. When 
there is disturbance of digestion, it is a g(X)d plan to prepare 
the stomach for the meal by sipping a glass of hot water on 
rising and an hour or less before each meal. The mineral 
waters may be used when desired ; the alkaline ones are apt to 
be of most value. Carbonated waters should be used with care, 
lest the flatulence they may cause give rise to symptoms the 
importance of which may be greatly exaggerated by the patient. 



554 DIF.T IN DISEASE. 

A question of great importance is whether or not alcohol 
should be used. As a general rule it should not be allowed. 
In cases with chronic lesions, where the patient has been accus- 
tomed to the use of alcohol all his life, it may be allowed, if 
not otherwise contraindicated, as by a tendency to cerebral 
hemorrhage, arteriosclerosis, chronic interstitial nephritis, and 
the like. The use of alcohol in the functional disorders is 
usually contraindicated. Its value as a food and as a stimulant 
to nutrition should not be overlooked, and it may be used with 
great benefit in the psychoses accompanied by exhaustive con- 
ditions. 

NEURALGIA. 

Neuralgia may be due to many causes, among them being the 
various diseases that affect metabolism. The cause of the 
neuralgia nuist be determined before a suital)le diet can be 
ordered. The following are among the most frequent causes : 
anemia, gout, lithemia, rheumatism, diabetes, and alcoholism. 
The diet to be prescribed is the diet suited to the condition. 

Alcohol is a fre((uent cause of severe neuralgias often sinni- 
lating migraine. The quantity used may be com})aratively 
trifling, and the patients frequently can not be classed as alco- 
holics. When no other cause for the disease is found all 
alcohol should be forbidden. In the cases de])en(lent on 
anemia and on exhausted conditions alcohol is, however, useful, 
and should l)e used in these cases to im])rove the nutrition, 
and not for tlie temporary feeling of well-being or for the relief 
of pain, which it may in reality engender. 

Tea and coffee should be forbidden in chronic neuralgia or 
where there ai'e frequent attacks. This does not, however, 
ap])ly to attacks of migraine that are not affected by coffee, or 
may even be relieved by a cup of hot strong coffee taken as tlie 
attack is al)out to come on. 

According to Gowers, vegetarianism may be a cause of 
neuralgia. In these cases the addition of meat to the diet will 
giv^e relief. The c(^nverse may be true, es])ecially where there 
is a gouty tendency, the ingestion of too nuich meat frequently 
being at the root of the trouble. Care and experience alone 
will help in deciding whether the pjitient is getting too nmch 
food, and whether his diet should be cut down and his elimina- 
tion increased, or w^hether the case is dependent on an insuffi- 
cient or impro])er diet. 

As a general rule, ])]ain wholesome food should l)e ordered 
at regular intervals. The ])atient should not be allowed to eat 
betw(^en meals. All rich, comphw, and highly seasoned foods 



DIET IX DISK ASKS OK TIIK yKIlVOl'S SYSTK^f. ^)^h) 

should be forbidden, as should nil iricd inods, pastrv, and any- 
thing known to disagree witli the patient, (are should, how- 
ever, be taken that the d'wt be not too restricted, for the 
patient^s ability to take difl'erent ai'tides is often purely imagi- 
nary. True idiosyncrasies for dillerent articles of food are not 
verv common. The excessive use of tol)acco niav be the cau>e 
of neuralgia. 

GASTRALGIA. 

A general rule may be made in these ea-es of avoidin^• 
excesses in alcohol, tea^ cotl'ee, sweets, and tobacco. in -ome 
cases the taking of food incn^ases the severiiv of the attack. 
The existence of stomach disorders should be carefullv detei'- 
mined, and if there is no a})})arent basis lor the trouble, a i-esL 
cure may give relief. 

There are other cases where the ])ain com(\s on when the 
stomach is empty. (See Diseases of the Stomach.) In these 
relief is often afforded In- giving a cu]) of hot milk or l)ouillon 
with a biscuit (cracker) in the middle of the morniiiLi" aixl 
afternoon, and at night on going to bed. Jf the ))ain bcL^ins 
in the night from the same cause, a glass of milk should be 
kept at the bedside, and when the patient is awakened bv the 
pain, he may take a few sips of the milk. 

VISCERAL NEURALGIA. 

When this is not relieved by ordinary means, the ])atient 
shoidd be put to bed and kept on a milk diet. Rc^peated ex- 
aminations should be made to determine the exact cause of the 
trouble. Many of these cases, where no cause can be assigned, 
are relieved by rest and a milk diet. 

MIGRAINE. 

Migraine, or sick headache, as it is ])()])tdarly termed, should 
not be confused with ordinary neuralgia. The diagnosis may 
at times be somewhat diflQcult. Much can be done to lessen 
the frequency of the attacks, but any attemj)t entirely to o\'er- 
come them has thus far proved fruitless. Open-air life of a 
vigorous kind probably does more good than anything else, but 
most of the sufferers from migraine fmd this impractical to 
carry out. The life of the patient shoidd be regulated care- 
fully. Sufficient sleep should be obtained and late hours 
avoided. The food should be plain and M'holesome, and taken 
at regular intervals, and eating between meiils should be dis- 
countenanced. Outdoor exercise should be insisted upon wher- 
ever possible. Excesses of all kinds nuist studiously be avoided. 



556 DIET IN DISEASE. 

It may be mentioned that sufferers from migraine are apt to 
attribute the cause of the attack to some article of food. This 
is not likely to be the case, and the patient should not be 
allowed to cut off first one and then another necessary article 
from his diet. Starch indigestion is present in some, and should 
receive careful attention. These patients occasionally get along 
best on a diet that is largely vegetarian, but this is not so in 
all cases. Coffee need not be prohibited, for, as a rule, it is 
not the cause of the trouble, and in some instances, when 
taken at the outset of an attack, it may even afford relief. 

INSOMNIA AND DISTURBED SLEEP. 

When not dependent upon other conditions, these are apt to 
be due either to eating at night or to a depressed state of the 
nutrition. For tlie first there is nothing to do bat to discon- 
tinue the habit of c>ating at night. There are but few ]xn'sons 
Avho reach middle age and wlio can cat late at night witli im- 
punity, and sooner or later the individual learns that he must 
give up the habit. There are some, however, Avith whom the 
practice seems to agree. 

When the trouble is caused by malnutrition or anemia, the 
general condition of the patient must be treated. Good food, 
regular hours, milk, or some light food between meals, and on 
going to bed a cup of hot milk, cocoa, or, if preferred, beef-tea, 
maltcid milk, or similar preparation may be ordered. 

In many cases where the nutrition is fairly good one of the 
hot drinks just mentioned taken at bedtime may be all that is 
necessary. This is especially true of the insomnia and disturbed 
sleep that follow the doing of mental work at night. The effect 
is to dilate tiie abdominal vessels and to restore the equilibrium 
of the circulation. A brisk walk in the open air or five 
minutes' exercise will often accomplish similar results. 

In the aged and the weak a " night-cap,'' in the form of a 
small glass of brandy or whisky, or a hot toddy, is acceptable 
and secur(;s a good night's rest. This should, jjowever, be dis- 
countenanced in the young and vigorous. 

VERTIGO. 

There are so many forms of vertigo, and it ari.-cs from so 
many widely different causes, that it nuist not be forgotten that 
a very common cause is in a disordered digestion. Indigestion 
from whatever cause may give rise to it, and the eating of cer- 
tain irritating foods, such as shell-fish, crabs, lobsters, and the 
like, inav occasionallv brin<r on an attack, nartieularlv in those

cause. All causes of verti^-o re(juire carel'ul stu(l\' heloi'e a 
(l(»Hnite opinion as to their cause is ^iven. 

EPILEPSY. 

E])ilepsy hears an inij)ortant relation to diet, 'i'liere is no 
S])ecitic " anti-e])ilepsy " diet, and there is no form of iood that 
can he assigned as a cause of ej)ilepsy ; it i.-, however, a llu't, 
that where the diet is carefully reirnlated the nunihci- of attacks 
arc usually lessened. This is particularly true ot" childi-en. The 
principle involved is to ^ive only as much food a> the patient 
can easily dio-est and assiniilat(>, and to all<»\v .-unieient time to 
elapse hetween feeding's for him to utilize and excrete the tiid- 
j)roducts of what he docs assimilate. When thi> is not don<'. 
attacks may be ])rovoked hy irritatini;' substances in the howel, 
by the absorption of toxic substances from the inte.-tinal tra(a, 
or by the accumulation of the ])roducts oi" metabolism in the 
body. In the e])ile])tic colonies no esjxvial diet is used, but the 
amount and the variety of f )od are so irgulated as to secure 
the best results. (See Craig Colony Dietary.) 

In children a diet composed largely of ndlk, with the addi- 
tion of cereals and fruit, is most useful. Jn oldei- pei-sons ttiis 
diet is not feasible except occasionally as a temporary measure. 
For these latter meat should be allowed only once a day, unless, 
on account of excessive manual labor or l)ecau,-e of a weakened 
condition of nutrition, the patient especially (K-mands it. Milk, 
cereals, bread, vegetables, and fruit should make up the rest 
of the dietary. Each patient should he instructed to take only 
digestible food, to take his meals regularly, and not to eat to() 
much. They should also be taught to eat slowly and ma.-ticate 
the food well. The avoidance of constipation is of primary 
importance, and this can usually be secured by the })roper use 
of fruits, and the coarser fonns of cereals. 

xV diet free from sodium chlorid with sodium bromid su])sii- 
tuted is of considerable value in the treatment of epilepsy. The 
eifect is more noticeable in the petit mal than in grand mal. but 
in both there is a decrease in the number of seizures. The 
effect of this treatment varies in dilferent individuals. German 
and French observers report remarkable results, but these have 
not been obtained in the United States, although there seems to 
be little question of the value of the treatment. In some 
patients the withdrawal of sodium chlorid })roduces untoward 
eftects, and these are more liable to occur when the bromid is 
not substituted. The salt-free diet is to be reirarded as an 



558 DIET IN DISEASE. 

adjunct to the bromid treatment. When the regime is badly 
borne there are dizziness, headache, weakness of the legs, loss 
of memory, edema, diarrhea, and often marked mental symptoms 
with a tendency to melancholia. There may be a marked loss 
of appetite, which may lead to a marked aversion for food. 
Some of Yoisin's patients had to be forcibly fed. Sometimes 
the withdrawal of salt causes irritability in the young, and may 
rouse the indolent to activity. 

Quiet, open-air life, pleasant occupation of a non-strenuous 
kind, an absence of worry, and agreeable forms of recreation 
are just as important as the diet in these cases. 

CHOREA. 

In chorea the diet is often of the greatest importance ; this is 
especially true wlien it occurs in anemic or debilitated children. 
Rest and an easily assimilable diet are the indications. The 
authors are of the opinion that absolute rest in bed, if possible 
isolated from the remainder of the family and under the care 
of a trained nurse, who should be a stranger, combined with a 
milk-diet or a diet composed largely of milk, will give better 
and more lasting results than any other form of treatment. If 
the patient is jinemic, beef-juice made from fresh beef may be 
used to advantage, as well as raw scraped beef and similar 
foods. (See Anemia.) 

APOPLEXY. 

The Comatose Stcir/e. — During the early stage of the comatose 
condition — /. e., for the first day or two — there is, as a rule, no 
necessity for giving the ])atient any food. As the disease is 
most likely to occur in obese, overfed individuals, the absti- 
nence from food is often beneficial. The intestinal tract should 
be fluslied out as soon after tlie ])atient is sch'U as is ])ra('tical)le. 
Those al)out the patient should l)e instructed carefully as to the 
dangers of attempting to feed the ])atient if he is unable to 
swallow, for he mav, on the one hand, (^hoke, and, on the other, 
he may draw food or drink into his lungs during inspiration, 
and so set up a pneumonia. 

If the ])atient is in need of nourishment or of fluid, it may 
be given by the rectum. Normal salt solution may be given 
by the rectum to supply the body with Huid, but it should not 
be given in too large quantities. (See Rectal Feeding.)

to be able to swallow witliout danger of ins])iring the food, he

may be fed by the mouth. Th(» food should l)e liquid or semi- 
solid, aud of a blaud, unstinudatino; character. The quantity 
should not be too lari^e. Milk, milk and e<^(z;s beaten together 
in the form of a milk-])unch, without, however, the addition of 
ii stimulant, broths, soft eggs, and milk thickened with cereals, 
or the purees of vegetables may be used. As the patient im- 
])roves other f )od may be added, but the diet should be light, 
easily digestible, and as non-stinudatiug as ])ossible. The 
patient should be warned against overeating and also against 
drinking. Alcohol is allowable only in the case of habitues 
who are threatened with collapse unless it is used, or iu the 
same class where food is not assimilated without it. It should 
always be given in moderate amounts, and the dosage arranged 
by the ]ihysician, and never left to the nurse, the ])atient, or the 
family. 

On account of the lack of exennse tlie di(^t should contain 
but little me^it, but cereals, vegetables, and fruit should be given 
in small quantities at a time, and as evenly distributed through- 
out the day as possible, to avoid overfilling of the vessels. 

The greatest danger, from a dietary st.'uulpoint, is in those 
patients who recover sufficiently to return to their ordinary 
modes of living. They should be very carefully instructed 
neither to drink to excess nor to overeat. A full meal and 
several drinks may be the cause of a second or of a fatal 
attack. 

DIET IN VARIOUS TOXIC CONDITIONS. 

CHRONIC MORPHIN POISONING. 

In the treatment of the morphin habit the diet is of great im- 
portance. A good plan is to institute the rest treatment and to 
give the patient as much food as possible. This method has 
the additional advantage that the patient is ke})t under better 
control if the nurse can be trusted; and none but one of the 
higliest character, wdio cannot be bribed, should be employed. 

In obese women who have formed the morphin habit — and 
many women who use the drug are a])t to take on flesh — rest 
in bed, with a milk diet, massage, and electricity, may be of 
great service. 

ALCOHOLISM. 

The mild forms of alcoholism are usually easily managed. 
So long as the stomach is irritable it should be given absolute 



560 DIET IN DISEASE. 

rest. If i^ossible, alcohol should be withheld entirely. As 
soon as the stomach will retain fluid, a saline mineral water or 
a saline purge should be given. Milk or bouillon is next to be 
prescribed, and, as the desire for food returns, a light diet of 
soft-boiled eggs, milk-toast, and the like should be allowed. 
After recovery all rich and highly seasoned food should be 
avoided, particularly the spices and peppers, which are com- 
monly used to excess. 

In the severe forms the diet should be that recommended for 
chronic gastritis. Some confirmed alcoholics can retain nothing 
in the stomach until they have had their morning drink. When 
nutrition is threatened, this may be allowed, but it is apt to 
lead to excesses later in the day. 

In the very severe forms, as in delirium tremens or in cases 
approaching it, the patient should take as much fluid as possible 
to flush out the system and the intestinal tract should be thor- 
oughly purged. The food should be given in a predigested or 
in a partially predigested form, and at frequent intervals. In 
this way the craving for drink is somewhat alleviated. Bouillon 
or beef-tea to which considerable amounts of black pepper or even 
Cayenne pepper have been added is useful in this condition, 
although their nse would be contraindicated for any but an 
alcohol-saturated ])erson. Rest and sural imentation as soon as 
food can be borne constitute the best method of managing these 
cases. Strychnin may be used as a stimulant. 

Illness or Injury in Alcoholics. — When a man who 
has been accustomed to taking several glasses of liquor every 
dav for vears is suddenly stricken ill or injured, delirium will 
often develop if the stimulant is rapidly withdrawn. In all 
such cases the accustomed amount of alcohol should be given, 
care being taken, however, to ])revent overindulgence. 

In alcoholics affected with pneumonia alcohol is necessary to 
sustain life. When delirium tremens o(!Curs in the course of 
pneumonia, alcohol should be ordered, although in ordinary, 
uncomplicated cases of delirium tremens due to extreme over- 
indulgence it should be withheld. 

CHRONIC LEAD POISONING. 

In this state especi:d eflbrt should be made to ascertain the 
cause, and where the (M)ndition is diu; lo the handling of le;id, 
fre(juent washing of the hands and cleansing of the flnger-nails, 
particularly before eating, should be advised. 



TlIK WKIR-MITCIIKLL IIKST CURE. 5G1 

Oliver states that abstiiioncc from alcoliol servos as a pre- 
ventive, and advocates that a substantial meal be taken before 
beginning work. Constipation is to be overcome by dietetic or 
medicinal means. Water should be drunk freely, and lemonade 
containing diluted sulphuric acid or ar(<inatlc sulphuric acid is 
advised as a prophylactic drink. Ten or lii'teen drops of tlie 
acid may be added to a glass of water. Milk is also drunk 
as a preventive by the workers in factories, but is ])rol)ably 
of use chiefly as a diuretic and for maintaining the nutrition. 

THE WEIR-MITCHELL REST CURE. 

In his little book, Fed and Blood, destined to be one of 
the classics of medicine, Weir Mitchell has given us the technic 
of his ^^ rest cure,'' which has been used so successfullv in the 
treatment of certain cases of nervous exhaustion. Others have 
made suggestions, and Playfair, Leyden, Keating, and others 
have given directions and diet-lists, but they diU'er but little 
from those of ]\Iitchell, and are not nearly so satisfactory. A 
careful reading of this book is recommended, for nothing beyond 
the essentials of the treatment can be given her(^ 

Mitchell defines the cure as a ^^ certain method of reviving 
the vitality of feeble people by a combination of entire rest and 
excessive feeding, made possible by passive exercise obtained 
through steady use of massage and electricity. '^ 

The treatment is applicable to many forms of nervous ex- 
haustion, but particularly to nervous women who have lost 
weight, — as ^litchell says, '^ those who are thin and lack 
blood." 

Before beginning this treatment it is im])ortant to ascertain 
whether the patient ^' is losing or has lost flesh, is by habit thin 
or fat." In those who have become emaciated as a result of 
disease a thinning of the blood occurs at the same time, and as 
the patient recovers the former body-weight, the l)lood, as a 
rule, becomes richer. There are certain anemic fat persons 
who require individual consideration. (See Obesity.) In fat, 
nervous patients the treatment is of little benelit, as it tends to 
increase the ac^cunmlation of flesh ; if other circumstances 
allow, these cases are better treated by a reduction cure, as 
detailed in another section. Those who derive most benefit 
from this treatment are patients that have lost flesh. The cure 
is indicated in nervous, exhausted conditions, and in certain 
other diseases in which the patient has lost flesh. In the very 

36 



562 DIET IN DISEASE. 

earliest stages of pulmonary tuberculosis tliis treatment, com- 
bined with an abundance of fresh air, is of benefit. For dys- 
peptics, cases of chronic malaria poisoning, and the like, it may 
also be recommended. In short, in any condition in which 
there are wasting and anemia, whether or not emotional dis- 
turbance is present, the rest cure will be found useful. Women 
are better subjects for this treatment than are men, as the latter 
are less able to endure the isolation. In women who are thin 
and anemic and Avho complain of being tired constantly, the cure 
is of the greatest service. These women become exhausted out 
of all proportion to the amount of exercise they take, and the 
^' tire ^' shows, as Mitchell puts it. In some cases nausea or 
diarrhea may even follow exertion. 

While the cure usually succeeds in properly selected cases, 
Mitchell states that in certain cases failing results from what he 
aptlv terms ^^ an unconquerable taste for invalidism,'^ from 
'^ sheer laziness," or in those cases '' to whom the change of 
moral atmos])here is not bracing." 

The method is more likely to succeed and is easier to conduct 
in severe cases than in mild cases. Playfair speaks of '' the 
half-ill who constitute the difficult cases." Organic disease is 
a contraindication, but there are certain conditions that are 
benefited by it. Heart disease with ruptured comj)ensation 
and the irritable heart of exophthalmic goiter are both suitable 
conditions for this treatment. Many uterine and ovarian disor- 
ders are cured by it, rendering (Operation unnecc^ssary, and those 
cases that have been operated u]")on without bringing relief may 
often be restored to health by this method of treatment. Float- 
ing kidney, as mentioned elsewhere, is a suitable condition, if 
the case is a recent one, for the rest treatment. (V'rtain forms 
of mental disturbance are greatly benefited by it, and the method 
of forced feeding of the insane is but an exam])le of this method 
of trciitment. Melancholia with ])eriods of agitation is oi'ten 
benefited by several weeks' (juiet and proper feeding when the 
agitation comes on. 

Tiie technic of the treatment is explained in a most interest- 
ing way by Mitchell, and the following details, largely con- 
densed, are taken from his book. The more nearly ])erieet the 
technic and th(» m(»re closely it is adhered to, the more likely is 
cur(! to ibilow. The cases are of various grades of severity,, 
and the treatment should be modified to suit the individual. 

Isolation is necessary, and the ])atient should be removed to 
a hospital or a sanitarium, away from familiar scenes. Home

treatment does not succeed well. If circumstances compel the 
patient to remain at home, her room should be chano'ed. In 
severe cases with emotional manifestations visitin<r is iorbidden, 
but it may be allowed to a " certain extent wheix' the patient is 
anemic owing to a distinct cause, as overwork, blood-losses, 
dyspepsia, low fevers, or nursino-." 

The nurse should be a stranger to the patient, and if for any 
reason the patient does not get along with the nurse, another 
nurse should be secured. She should be a strong, healthy, firm 
woman, w^ith tact and suihciiently attractive qualities. The 
family should not be allowed to nurse the patient, for, as (). W. 
Holmes says, ''the hysterical girl is a vampire who sucks the 
blood of the healthy people al)out her/^ 

Communication with friends and family should, as a rule, be 
cut off entirely, and not even the reading of letters shouhl be 
allowed. Ai'ter sevend wrecks, if the patient is improving, she 
may be allowed to read the newspaper each day. 

Rest is a most importimt feature, and, as a rule, the patient 
should be put to bed for six weeks or two months. 

In other cases, especially where the ])atient is not able to un- 
dergo the regular treatment, as in dispensary cases, a modified 
rest cure may be tried. The following is Mitchell's schedule 
for such cases ; this may be modified according to circum- 
stances : 

" 7.30 A. M. : Cocoa, coffee, hot milk, beef extract, or hot 
water. Bath (temperature stated). Rough rub with towel or 
flesh-brush. Bathing and rubbing may be done by attendant. 
Lie down a few minutes after finishing. 

''8.30 A. M. : Breakfast in bed. (Debiil as to diet. Tonic, 
aperient, malt extract as ordered.) May read letters, papers, 
etc., if eyes are good. 

" 10-11 A. M. : Massage if required is usually ordered one 
hour after breakfast, or Swedish movements are given at that 
time. An hour's rest follows massage. Less rest is needed 
after the movements. (Milk or broth aft<3r massage.) 

"12 M. : Rise and dress slowly. If gymnastics or massage 
are not ordered, may rise earlier. May see visitors, attend to 
household affairs, or walk out. 

"1.30 A. M. : Luncheon. (Malt, tonic, et<}., ordered.) In 
invalids this should be the chief meal of the day. Rest, lying 
down, not in bed, for an hour after. 

" 3 p. M. : Drive (use street cars or walk) one to two and 
one-half hours. (Milk or soup on retuj-n.) 



564 DIET IN DISEASE. 

^^ 7 p. M. : Su2)per. (Malt, tonic, etc., ordered, detail of 
diet.) 

^^ 10 P. M. : Hot milk or other food at bedtime." 

This may be altered by omitting the out-door exercise in in- 
valids or for business men who can rest only part of the time 
by conducting their business in the morning, utilizing the after- 
noon for massage and rest. If massage is not ordered, no ex- 
pense is attached to this routine. 

In extreme cases the patient is made to rest absolutely. iSTo 
exertion of any kind is to be allowed. The bed-])an is to be 
used with the patient in the recumbent position. She should 
be removed to a couch for an hour, both morning and evenino;;, 
while the bed is being freshened. The patient should be fed, 
and later, when allowed to feed herself, the meat should be out 
up for her. A sponge-bath should be given daily, but if it 
causes depression, it may be given less frecjuently. After two 
weeks, if it is thought desirable, the patient may be read to for 
one to three hours. The monotony of the treatment is not so 
trying as would be imagined, for the routine of the day occu- 
pies most of the time. An important part of the treatment is 
the moral suasion, and when no good can be attained in this 
direction, the physician should judiciously seek to lead the 
thoughts of his patient to the selfishness of the life previously 
led. The nurse and masseuse should not be allowed to tjilk 
about or to listen to the patient's ills, and she should be taught 
that she must s})eak of them only to the physician. 

Massage and electricity are resorted to in order to main- 
tain nutrition and circulation while at rest. Mitchell gives 
minute instructions regarding both. General massage of the 
whole body is to be given, care being taken not to excite pain 
by manipulating tender areas. The tapping movements, slap- 
ping, and the like arc not to be used in nervous patients. Care 
should be exercised to avoid producing sexual excitement ; this 
may be aroused in both sane and insane patients from friction 
nciir the genitals or over the back or buttocks. If it does 
occur, the operator should avoid the sensitive areas. In the 
average case massage should be given for an hour daily for 
about six weeks, and then on each alternate day. The time 
chosen for this should be about midway between me^ils. Care 
should be taken to keep the parts warmed by the massage well 
covered. 

The same precautions should be taken in using electricity 
as when giving massage. The induced current should be used.

liiid it is Avoll to oni])l()y a bnttcrv in which the breaks are very 
slow — Irom two to five seeonds, Tlie more rapid intorriiptions 
are useful, however, but iu tlic hands of an unskilful operator 
may excite paiu and appreiiensiou iu tlie j)atieut. The })oles 
may be placed four or five inches apart on the muscle, and the 
whole body should be gone (►ver. 

The diet is one of suraliuu^ntation. In many cases milk 
should form the basis of the diet at iirst. Karcll's method of 
administration is to be used. (See ^lilk Cure.) 

In those patients who are obese, anemic, and nervous (or 
even when they are not), in whom the other methods i)^ reduc- 
tion are of no value, a reduction secured by means of rest and 
a milk diet often succeeds. The milk may be skinuned if nec- 
essary. The patient is put to bed and ])laced on a milk and 
general diet and then on an exclusive milk diet. Massage and 
electricity are employed, and the patient's weight is noted. If 
it does not decrease, the amount of milk is decreased to three 
]>ints or even to a quart a day until the weight has fallen to 
the desired number of pounds. The diet is then gradually in- 
creased and the patient by degrees allowed to go about. Direc- 
tions for the future diet must be given ; this should be along 
the lines laid down in the section on Obesity. 

In thin, anemic, exhausted women, who are the ones usually 
treated, the diet is as follows : The ])atient is put to bed and 
the diet gradually changed from the ordinary diet to a milk 
diet. This is done by giving from three to four ounces of milk 
(>very two hours, after the Karell method. Then the patient 
is given two quarts of milk in each twenty-four hours. The 
amount is divided, and a ])orti()u given at three-hour intervals. 
At the end of the first week a pound of beef is administered 
in the form of a raw soup. This is given three times a day, 
one pound of beef being used each day. If desire<l, this may 
be replaced by peptonized food. (See fornnilas in the Appendix.) 

After ten days three meals a day are given. These are led up 
to gradually, and the patient is kept on the milk diet until the 
stomach feels comfortjible. Then, usually within from four 
days to a week, a light breakfast is allowcnl, and in a few days 
more a chop is given at the midday meiil. After a short time 
the patient is given three full meals, together with three or 
four pints of milk instead of water, either with or after the 
meals. 

After about ten days of this treatment from two to four 
ounces of a good fluid extract of malt are given before each 



566 DIET IN DISEASE. 

meal. ^^As to meals, I leave them to tlie patient's caprice, 
unless this is too unreasonable ; but I like to give butter largely, 
and have little trouble in having this most wholesome of fats 
taken in large amounts. A cup of cocoa or of coffee and milk 
on waking in the morning is a good preparation for the fatigue 
of the toilet.'' 

In some of the difficult cases half an ounce of cod-liver oil 
is given half an hour after eacli meal. If it causes nausea or 
interferes with the appetite, it is given as a rectal injection. 
This is of particular service where the bowels are sluggish. It 
may also be given in the form of an emulsion with pancreas 
extract. In some it acts admirably ; in others it may cause 
tenesmus. 

Alcohol is not necessary to the treatment, and, as a rule, is 
omitted, although a small amount helps in the accumulation of 
fat. It should always be used with great care and judgment. 
In those who have never taken it to excess or used it habit- 
ually Mitchell gives it in small daily doses. An ounce of 
whisky in milk or a glass of red wine or of clmm])agne he 
regards as a useful adjuvant, as it increases the desire to take 
food at meals. In some even the small amount contained in 
malt extract may cause excitement, and for these cases the 
thicker malt extracts or the Japanese extract, which is made 
from barley and rice, are prescribed. 

Iron is given in large doses as soon as the patient begins to 
take solid fowl, and sometimes before. The form is not of as 
much importance as the dosage. The carbonate and the lactate 
are the forms prescribed by Mitchell. If the patients claim 
that they can not take iron, five grains of the pyrophosphate are 
added to each ounce of malt, and it is given without their 
knowledge. It is generally well borne, and after a month's 
time it may usually be given with good results iu the ordinary 
forms. The peptonates of iron and manganese may also be 
administered either with or without malt. No other drugs 
are given except as needed to regulate the bowels — cascara, 
aloes, etc. When the patient begins to sit up, strychnin in full 
doses with iron and arsenic is given.

Schedule as above until desired effect is obtained. This to 1x3 modified to

extract with a teaspoonful of solution of peptonate of iron and manganese, or 
a tablespoonful of Gude's Peptomangan. Hydrochloric acid, j)epsin, and nux 
vomica are useful if there is discomfort after eating. Bowels to be kept open. 
Use butter in as large quanties as possible. 

The following is a sample schedule ^ in a marked case in a 
patient of thirty -three : 

" Patient remained in bed in entire repose. She was fed, 
and rose only for the purpose of relieving the bladder and 
rectum. 

^^Oct. 10th : Took one quart of milk in divided doses every 
two hours. 

"11th: A cup of coffee on rising and two quarts of milk 
in divided portions every two hours. A pill of aloes every 
nio^ht, Avhich answered for a few davs. 

'n2th-15th: Same diet. The dyspepsia by this time was 
relieved, and she slept without the habitual dose of chloral. 
The pint of raw soup was added, in three portions, on the 16th- 

"17th and 18th : Same diet. 

"19th: She took, on awaking at 7, coffee; at 7.30 half- 
pint of milk; and the same at 10 A. ^i., V2 :sr., '2, 4, 6, 8, and 
10 p. M. The soup at 11 a. m., and at 5 and p. m. 

" 23d : She took for breakfast an egg and bread and butter ; 
and two days later (25th) dinner was added, and also iron. 

"On the 28th this was tlie schedule : On waking, coffee at 7. 
At 8, iron and malt. Breakfast, a chop and bread and butter ; 
of milk, a tumbler and a half. At 11, soup. At 2, iron and 
malt. Dinner closing with milk, one or two tumblers. The

dinner consisted of anything she hked, and with it she took six 
ounces of Burgundy or dry champagne. At 4, soup. At 7, 
malt, iron, bread and butter, and usually some fruit, and com- 
monly two glasses of milk. At 9, soup; at 10, an aloe pill. 
At 12 M., massage occupied an hour; at 4.30 P. M., electricity 
was used for an hour. 

'^ This diet-list, reached in a few days by a woman who had 
been unable to digest the lightest meal with comfort, seemed 
certainly remarkable. She began to gain at the end of the 
second week ; the effect was noticed in her face, and during 
her two months in bed she went from 96 pounds to 136, 
and the gain in color was not less marked. At the sixth 
Aveek the soup was dropped, wine abandoned, the iron 
lessened one-half, the massage and electricity used on alter- 
nate days, and the limbs exercised as I have described. The 
usual precautions as to rising and exercise were carefully at- 
tended to, and at the end of the ninth week of treatment my 
patient took a drive. At this time all mechanical treatment 
ceased, the milk was reduced to a quart, the iron to five grains 
three times a day, and the malt continued. At the end of six 
weeks I began to employ strychnin in doses of one-thirtieth of 
a grain thrice a day at meals, and this was kept up for several 
montlis, together with the iron and malt. The cure was com- 
plete and i^ermanent." 

The ])atient is allowed to undertake movements for herself 
very gradually, being allowed to move about in the bed by her- 
self and th(!n sit up, and later on to sit out-doors, and then to 
walk a few ste])s, to take a drive, etc. Tf this is not done 
gradually, the moving about may be attended by dizziness, ver- 
tigo, or unpleasant exhaustion, which may be avoided entirely 
by gradually increasing the ])atient's efforts for herself. 

Astheno])ia is a most troublesome sym})tom,and })atients who 
do not exhibit it generally make good recoveries. Where it 
exists, an ophthalmologist should be consulted. The eye trouble 
may persist long after all other sym])t()ms have disap])eared. 

The following schedule,' abridged fnjni Mitchell, is instructive 
as showing the method of treating a man who continued at his 
business while undergoing the treatment. The ])atient was fifty- 
three years old, and had broken down after thirty years of 
constant application to business, lie had a cough, was greatly 
emaciated, and exhibited numerous nervous sym})toms.

'^ 12 M. : Dressed with as little ])ersonal effort as possible; a 
second goblet of iron and malt was given him, and a carriage 
took him to his office, where he remained two honi's, a carriage 
bringing him back. Walking was forbidden. He was then 
given dinner, preceded by half a tumbler of iron water. After 
dinner, which included a goblet of milk, the third goblet of milk 
and malt was swallowed. Then a short drive might be taken. 
By 4 o'clock the patient must be undressed and in bed. 

^'6 P. M. ; The third dose of iron water and a light supper 
of fruit, bread and butter, and cream, followed by a fourth goblet 
of milk and malt. Tw-o quarts of milk were given in addition 
to the other food. 

'^ 9 P. M. : Massage for one hour, followed l)y beef-soup, four 
ounces. 

"From 125 pounds he went up in six weeks to 133 pounds, 
and reached 140 a month and a half later, and has continued to 
gain. A year later he was well and strong, and had ceased to 
be what he had been for vears — a delicate man.'' 



DIET FOR THE INSANE. 

Feeding constitutes a very important part of the traitment of 
the insane. All insane patients who are heloir tJie standard oj 
nutrition should he built up, and an earnest effort made to increa,'<e 
the ireight of the pedient. One of the English alienists was wont 
to talk of the " gospel of fatness." This is best accomplishe<^l 
by a system of feeding somewhat similar to that outlined in the 
rest treatment, the rest being prescribed or omitted as the case 
demands. It should always be remembered that an insane per- 
son may contract other diseases besides his mentiil disorder, and 
these should be carefully sought for and properly treated ; this 
is true especially of stomach and intestinal disorders, wdnch may 
give rise to delusions regarding the taking of food. 

When the patient refuses food, the question as to the advisa- 
bility of feeding him by force arises ; opinions are divided on 
this point. Everything considered, it is well to begin the forced 
feeding early, before the patient has time to suffer from his 



570 DIET IN DISEASE. 

fasting. It should be accomplished by means of the stomach- 
tube or the nasal tube, and about a liter (1 quart) of food should 
be introduced. The food may be given thus twice daily, and in 
the case of weak patients three or four times a day. Milk, 
milk and eggs, and broths may be used for this purpose. A 
sufficient number of attendants should be at hand to control the 
patient if he becomes unruly and resists feeding. After a pa- 
tient has been fed with the tube several times he will often prefer 
to take his nourishment in the usual manner. 

Whether the esophageal or the nasal tul)e is to be used will 
depend on the preference of the physician. Each has its advan- 
tages. The nasal tube is generally preferred, since it is easier 
to introduce, can not be bitten by the patient, and does not 
cause the patient to struggle as much as the stomach-tube ; it 
may, however, be passed into the larynx, and in this way liquid 
miMit be introduced into the trachea. This dano;er is more 
fancied than real, and can be avoided if the patient is allowed 
to breathe before the fluid is ]:)0urcd into the tube. While he 
is breathing the tube should be pinched, and if it is in the 
larynx, this fact will be noticed at once. Ordinarily, l)ut not 
always, coughing ensues ; it docs not follow when the larynx is 
anesthetic, as it occasionally is in the insane or hysteric. The 
stomach-tube does not allow the food to be regurgitated so 
easily as the nasal tube, but for this method of feeding a mouth- 
gag is required that may injure the mouth or teeth, or it may 
slip, permitting the patient to bite the tube. If the patient has 
acquired the knack of regurgitating the food, this may be ])re- 
vented by tickling the ril)S while the fluid is being introduced. 
This prevents the flxing of the diaphragm, and is successful in 
most cases. 

Tact and experience in handling the insane are of the greatest 
value. Some nurses or attendants have little difficulty in get- 
ting patients to eat, whereas others seem never to learn how to 
manage them. It nuist be remembered that an insane patient 
may not eat for reasons that are often easily overcome. He 
may prefer to take his food alone, because he does not think 
himself worthy of eating at the same table or with other people. 
He may fear that his food has been poisoned, and he should be 
convinced of tlie fallacy of this by the nurse, who siiould eat a 
j)ortion before him, or allow him see the food j)rei)ared, or he 
may be given food that can not easily ])e poisoned, su(^li as (".^g^^y 
whole vegetables, and fruit. When the patient's contidence is 
gained, the battle is generally won. In some cases the delusion 
persists f<jr a long time and can not be dis])elled. 



DISEASES rX WIHCII DIET IS A miMAllY E ACTOR. TjTI 

Food should always be served daintily. An insane ])prson 
who may be very much unl)alan(X'd may still notice the slie^htest 
variations in the way of servini;; ibod. Attendants are apt to* 
be negligent in this res|)ect. For all patients who have a sui- 
cidal tendency the food should be served on dishes that can not 
be broken. No knives should b(.' allowed, and th(; ibod should 
be so served as to require no cutting. An atti^ndaut shoidd 
watch those who are apt to bolt their Ibod, and see thnt It is cut 
fine before serving it. Cases of sudden death have followed the 
drawingof a pleceof meat Intothe larynx whih' entlngtoo rapidlv. 

Children of very nervous parents and thos(^ whose consti- 
tutions are of the nervous type require carelul dietetic super- 
vision, and the clilld should be trained to like the ])lain and 
wholesome varieties of food, and never be given tlu; rich, highly 
seasoned dishes that so (»ften disturb the digestion of nervous 
children. Milk should form the basis of the diet, and egu^s and 
meat should be given in moderate quantities along with cereals 
and the wholesome vegetables. As a rule, infants should \w 
kept on a milk diet for a longer period than other children, and 
the change to a general diet should be made M'lth caution. Tea 
and coffee, as well as alcohol, should always be f)rbidden. 
Every effort should be made to nourish the child, and to have 
him lead a wholesome, quiet, out-of-door life. 

DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 

DIABETES. 

Diabetes is a disease of the greatest interest to the student of 
dietetics, f )r it is alone by the regulation of the diet that the 
diabetic's life is made comfortable and his days ]n'olonged. The 
disease Avas known to the ancients, but Its management was not 
understood. The sweet taste of the urine was known, too, but 
Thomas Willis (1674) is generally credited with WAwj^ the fir-t 
to note this fact, while Rollo (1797) was the first to use diet- 
etic restrictions in the treatment of the disease, and since his 
time the literature is so extensive that mention cannot l)e made 
even of the most important contributions. Among the names 
of the men who have added to our knowledge of diabetes are 
Claude Bernard, Bouchardat, Dujardln-P>eauinetz, (rerniain See, 
Frerichs, Ebstein, Seegen, von Noorden, Senator, Kiilz, Pavy, 
Minkowski, Lepine, Naunyn, Opie, and von Mering. 

Diabetes is a very ditficidt disease to understand, and its 
management is not nearly as simple a problem as it used to be 



572 DIET IN DISEASE. 

thought. It is a condition in which the individual is no longer 
able to utilize perfectly grape-sugar in the processes of nutri- 
tion. The sugar is not burnt in the processes of metabolism, 
but circulates in the blood, and when it passes a certain per- 
centage is excreted in the urine. It should be borne in mind, 
however, that not every one who passes sugar in the urine is a 
diabetic. 

Alimentary Glycosuria. — As long as the amount of sugar 
circulating in the blood does not exceed the ])hysiologic limit 
it does not ])ass out of the body with the excretions, except, 
perhaps, in the most trifling quantities in the urine. When 
the amount of carbohydrate material is insufficient, grape-sugar 
is manufactured from the body-fat, and from that taken as food, 
and from the protein. This probably occurs only when the 
amount of carbohydrate ingestion is too small to supply the 
needs of the body. AViien the carbohydrate material exceeds 
the amount necessary for immediate use, it is stored up in the 
liver and muscles, and when the limit of capacity of these 
organs is reached, the carbohydrates are converted into fat and 
deposited in the subcutaneous tissues and elsewhere. 

It sometimes happens that an individual who later on de- 
velops diabetes will have a period in which the carbohydrate is 
utilized ratlier poorly ; the excess, instead of being passed in 
the urine, is deposited as fat. Later on, when the carbohydrate 
tolerance lessens, the patient excretes sugar in the urine. In 
normal individuals, when the su],ply is larger than can be dis- 
posed of by use and storage, tlie blood becomes exceedingly 
rich in grape-sugar and the excess is excreted in tlie urine, and 
this is known as alimentary glycosuria, which nuist not be con- 
fused with diabetes mellitus. Normally, minute traces of sugar 
are found in the urine, but these amounts are so small as not to 
be detected by ordinary tests, and for pur])oses of practice 
normal urine may be regarded as free from sugar. 

Alimentary glycosuria occurs when large quantities of sugar 
are ingested at short intervals, and the kind of sugar found in 
the urine is the same as that which has been taken : if grajie- 
sugar has been ingested, glycosuria results ; if cane-sugar, sac- 
charosuria ; if fruit-sugar, levulosuria ; and if milk-sugar, lac- 
tosuria. The jnnount to produce alimentary glycosuria, or the 
other forms, varies with the individual, and also whether the 
sugar is taken with other food or when fasting. 

vVccording to Van Noorden, sugar appears in the urine after 
a simple ingestion of — 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY E ACT OR. 573 

Milk-siio^ar, iiioro than 120 <j^in. ; 
Cane-sii<^ar, nioiv than 150 to 200 <^n\. ; 
Fruit-sugar, more tliau 200 gni. ; 
Grape-sugar, more than 200 to 250 gni. 

These figures are only a})j)roxiniate, and represent tlie amount 
taken when the individual is fasting. The limit is higher when 
the stomaeh eontains food. Jf the individual is healthy, any 
amount of stareh may be taken without eausing sugar to appear 
in the urine. The proeesses of conversion take so long that 
sutmr cannot enter into the circulation in larire (luantities at 
one time. 

When sugar is excreted, diabetes niellitus should alw;iys be 
suspected. Milk-sugar may be found at times in the urine of 
nursing women. Glycosuria may be due to various causes, 
among which may be mentioned mor[)hin and amy! nitrite, for 
example. Injury to the floor of the fourth ventricle, as (k'uion- 
strated by Claude Bernard's famous experiments, and certain 
nervous and liver disorders, may also predispose to the produc- 
tion of glycosuria. 

Diabetes mellitus may be produced experimentally by extir- 
pating the pancreas, or by the administration of ])hloridziu. 
Lesions consisting of hyaline degeneration of the islands of 
Langerhans in the pancreas have been descril)ed by Opie, an<l 
Cohnheim has shown that the pancreas furnishes a substance 
which, when mixed Avith a substance from the muscles, causes 
the conversion of sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid. When 
either is withheld, the sugar is not converted. When the pan- 
creatic substance is furnished in excess it hinders or may stop 
the process altogether. Lesions that have been found in the 
pancreas may mean that there is a deficiency of this substanc(% 
and consequently an inability to utilize glycogen. The glycogen 
which is seen after the ingestion of certain poisons, or after ner- 
vous injuries, is probably due to the emptying of the glycogen 
from its storehouses in the body into the circulation. That 
which occurs in diabetes in man and in experimental ])ancreatic 
diabetes is evidently caused by the lessened consum])tion of 
sugar in the tissues, and that which is produced by phloridzin 
is apparently due to a combination of both factors. 

The patient is not to be regarded as a diabetic unless he 
passes urine more or less constantly containing grape-sugar. 
This must be present after the ingestion of moderate amounts 
of carbohydrates, and simultaneously with this excretion of 



574 DIET IN DISEASE. 

grape-sugar there occur polyuria, tliirst, appetite, emaciation, 
and many other symptoms tliat the student should flimiliarize 
liimself with by reference to the text-books on the subject. 

Plaving made the diagnosis of diabetes, the next point to con- 
sider carefully is the best method of treating the disease, and 
there are two things which should be borne constantly in mind : 
first, that the treatment is largely dietetic, and with certain 
exceptions drugs play little or no part in the management of 
the disease ; and secondly, that every patient must be treated 
somewhat differently. The general principles underlying the 
management of the disease may be laid down, but to manage 
successfully the diet of a diabetic patient requires a careful study 
of the metabolism of that patient, not only at tlie beginning of 
treatment, but from time to time tliroughout the course of the 
disease. Fortunately, for the purposes of ordinary practice 
this is not a matter of very great difficulty. There are two fac- 
tors which must be kept constantly in mind : first, the total 
excretion of sugar in any given twenty-four hours, and the char- 
acter of the diet upon which the patient is at the time the test 
is made ; and second, the presence or absence of various acids, 
as will be noted later. 

The method of studying a patient is first to obtain tlie urine 
passed in twenty-four hours, and estimating by one of the sim- 
ple laboratory methods the percentage of sugar present and 
ascertaining the total amount of sugar excreted. This gives a 
good idea of what tlie ]:)atient is doing on an ordinary diet. 
After this has been determined the patient sliould be placed 
upon a carbohydrate-free diet, and this should be continued for 
five days. 

Von Noorden uses the following carbohydrate-free diet as a 
standard : 

Bre(tkf(id: 5 gm. of tea stecjx'd in 200 c.c. of water; loO 
gm. of ham ; 1 e^^i^. 

Luncheon: 200 gm. cold roast beef; GO gni. fresh cucumbers 
with 5 gm. vinegar, 10 gm. olive oil, and salt and pepper to 
taste; 20 c.c. brandy with 400 c.c. Apollinaris water; GO c.c. 
coffee without milk or sugar. 

Dinner : 200 c.c. ck^ar })ouillon ; 2o() gm. beef (weighed raw), 
basted with 10 gm. butter ; 80 gm. green salad with 10 gm. 
vinegar nnd 20 gm. olive oil, or >\ tables])Oonfuls of some well- 
cooked green vegetable ; >) sardines in oil ; 20 c.c. cognac with 
400 c.c. A])ollinaris water. 

Supper : 2 v^j^^^ (raw or cooked) ; 400 c.c. seltzer water. 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY EACTOR. 575 

This standard diet is tree from carbohydrates, and contains 
almost 2()() gni. alhnmin (with o2 ^m. nitroucn) and about 135 
txm. fat. 

It should be borne in mind that this carbohydratc-frce diet 
should not be started suddenly, as tlien^ is danger, if the diabetic 
is advanced in the disease, that an acid intoxication may be set 
u]). It is well to restrict the diet gradually, takino- from five 
davs to a week to reach the ])oint ^\■here the ])atlent is ])laced 
on a carbohydrate-free diet, llic urine is obtained f )r each 
twenty-four hours, and the cases may be roughly divided into 
those in whom the urine becomes free from suaar, those in whom 
the suii'ar excretion is markedly diminished, and thos(! in whom 
the suii^ar excretion is practically unchanged. In a general way 
these re})resent respectively milder and more fivorable eases, 
cases that are severe, and the more or less ho])eless cases. If 
the patient becomes sugar free the strict diet should be con- 
tinued for two or three days, and then it should be determined 
how much carbohydrate the patient can metabolize without caus- 
ing glycosuria. This is done by adding to the diet a known 
quantity of carbohydrate, preferably in the form of ordinary 
bread, 30 gm. or an ounce being usually adtled the fir.-t day, 
and if this does not cause sugar to be excreted, a doul)le amount 
the second day, and so on, until sugar reapjiears in the urine. 
By this method the patient's tolerance for starch is easily deter- 
mined, and may be noted on a record in the f )llowing way : 

Tolerance ^^ standard diet ^ x gram starch. 

The amount of carbohydrate which may be allowed this ])ar- 
ticular ])atient should be well within the limits of his ])owers 
of utilizing it. It must be borne in mind that there are Vvide 
variations of glycosuria in a diabetic patient, and conclusions 
should not be too hastily dra\vn. There are variations in the 
amount of sugar excreted due to other causes than the diet, and 
these if not taken into account may lead to unnecessary restric- 
tions. If, however, tlu^ ])atient's urine is frcTpiently examined, 
these will soon be eliminated. It should also be l)orne in mind 
that glycosuria varies from time to time, but if the disease is 
progressing the tolerance for starch diminishes, whereas if the 
patient is progressing favorably the starch tolerance remains 
the same, or will even be increased. It is ibr this reason that 
tests must be made at stated intervals, if the })atient is to be 
properly cared for. 

It is important to keep a record of the tolerance of the patient 



576 DIET IN DISEASE. 

at the time that the examinations are made. This is best done 
by using the formula^ as follows : 

Tolerance := standard diet -j- gm. starch. 
Tolerance = standard diet -f- 100 gm. meat. 
Tolerance =^- standard diet 4- x "ni. suo^ar. 

These are varied according to conditions, and furnish a simple 
and accurate method of recording the progress of a case. 

The different varieties of carbohydrates ingested may vary in 
the glycosuria-producing power. Grape-sugar causes the largest 
percentage of sugar to appear in the urine in the shortest time. 
Starch, maltose, and dextrose very closely resemble grape-sugar 
in this respect. Fruit-sugar augments the glycosuria only to 
one-half the extent when given in the same amounts, and milk- 
sugar stands about midway between the two. Fat never causes 
glycosuria, and alcohol in moderate amounts does not increase 
it. Exercise aifects the glycosuria of diabetes in early cases. 
While the nutrition is good, a limited amount of exercise lessens 
the amount of sugar in the inline, whereas in old cases and in 
emaciated patients exercise increases the glycosuria. In cases 
that are at all severe as much energy should be saved for the 
])atient as possible by regulating the amount of moving about 
and insisting on long ])eriods of rest, and energy may also be 
s])ared by care in ])rotecting the patient from cold. A (piiet, 
regular life is very imj^ortant, as glycosuria is increased by 
mental and nervous excitement. 

Glycosuria bears a very close relation to the condition of the 
digestive organs. Wlien there is any gastric disturbance, owing 
to the lessened al)sorption, the amount of sugar is generally les- 
sened, but it sliould be boriK} in mind that while tliis is true in 
the severer forins of the disease, tlie amount of acid is often 
markedly and suddenly increased, so that in all severe cases in 
wliieh the ])atient is takinir rethiecd diet, or in which there is 
any gastric or intestinal disturbance, a close watch should be 
kej)t over the acid excretion. Acute febrile diseases and the 
chronic diseases accompanied b\- lever lessen the amount of 
sugar in the urine, but also ha\'e a tendency to increase the acid. 

An interesting fact is that glycosuria may disappear when 
chronic interstitial ne])hritis supervenes. In gouty patients the 
ui'ine may be free from sugar during the exacerl)ations ol' th(i 
disease. 

The Fatal Ratio, — Mandel and Fusk have suggested a 
method f )r prognosis in diabetes. The })atient is j)laced on a 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 577 

meat-fat diet, consisting of meat, rich cream, butter and eggs, 
and tlie urine is collected on the second day, so that an early 
morning hour before breakfast terminates the period for one 
day. The amount of dextrose and nitrogen are determined, 
and if the ratio of the dextrose to the nitrogen is •i.Go to 1 it 
signifies a complete intolerance for the carbohydrates, and prob- 
ably a rapidly fatal outcome. They call this the fatal ratio. Jf 
the ratio between the dextrose and nitrogen is lower, it signifies 
that some carbohydrate may be utilized. 

Acidosis. — Every patient with diabetes should be carefully 
watched in this regard by frequent examinations for ketone 
bodies — acetone, diacetic acid, and oxy butyric acid. The 
simplest method is to test for one of them, diacetic acid, which 
may be easily done -by adding ferric chlorid solution to the 
urine ; if diacetic acid is present, it turns a deep red color, and, 
in a rough way, the darker the red, the more diacetic acid is 
present. Acidosis is seen only in severe cases wdien the patient 
is living under ordinary circumstances ; but it may occur even 
in milder cases, when the patient has been on a very restricted 
diet, when there is much gastro-intcstinal disturbance, or some- 
times if the patient is taking too much exercise. If the acidosis 
is marked, it produces drowsiness, and, in severe cases, the 
greatest danger is the development of diabetic coma. The 
management of the acidosis is just as important, and sometimes 
more important than the management of the glycosuria, and the 
time that the patient needs watching most is when the diet has 
been restricted and the patient is just becoming free from sugar. 
If the patient passes this period without developing any symp- 
toms of acidosis, it is always a favorable sign. Jf the acid is 
present, it is usually well not to have the patient on a carbo- 
hydrate-free diet, as the fats, and even some of the proteins, are 
liable to form ketone bodies when they are metabolized without 
the presence of some carbohydrates. As some one has a])tly 
remarked : '' The fats are burned in the flame of the carbo- 
hydrates." 

The treatment consists in adding a certain amount of carbo- 
hydrate to the food and the administration of alkalis ; about 
30 grams of bicarbonate of soda a day may be given, and this 
amount may be reduced as the urine becomes free from acid. It 
is a good working rule that if the acidosis continues after the 
administration of 2o grams of bicarbonate of soda a day, to 
allow from 50 to 125 grams of carbohydrate, and in old, un- 
treated cases even more than this may be necessary. Calcium 
37 



578 DIET IN DISEASE. 

carbonate is sometimes given in closes of 5 to 6 grams, and some 
persons prefer potassium bicarbonate^ which may be used if 
desired. If the acidosis does not yield to these means, it is 
well to try one of the special diets, particularly tlie oatmeal 
diet, as outlined elsewhere in this article. The use of an oat- 
meal diet for a week or ten days often gives the most remark- 
able results. We have also used the soy bean diet in some 
cases with favorable outcome. 

Diabetic Coma. — In cases in which coma is threatened 
the treatment must be energetic. It consists of the adminis- 
tration of large doses of alkali ; this may be given by the 
stomach, by rectum, or intravenously. Ordinarily, the intra- 
venous method is only used in cases in which coma has actually 
developed. It is important to see that too much water is not 
taken at one time, as in these patients it is liable to produce 
severe dilatation of the stomach. Large quantities are some- 
times taken to allay thirst, or sometimes l)y direction of the 
physician in attempting to thoroughly wash out the patient. 
While the maximum amount of fluid that can be utilized 
should be given, one should bear in mind that there is a limit 
to the amount that sliould be administered. Salt solution, with 
or without the addition of bicarbonate of soda, may be given 
per rectum by the drop method. The administration of large 
doses of alcohol is also advisable. Champagne is probably the 
most effective, but whisky or brandy or the stronger wines may 
be used. The diet should consist of oatmeal gruel or other 
cereal gruels and milk. If the case has not been under treat- 
mi'ut, it may be advisable to administer sugar in some form 
when the case is first seen. Care should be taken not to abuse 
this part of the treatment. If deep coma develops, the treat- 
ment is very unsatisfactory. The intravenous administration 
of about 1500 c.c. of normal salt solution, to which about o 
per c(!nt. of sodium bicarbonote has been added, is advisable; 
this represents about .'>0 grams to the liter, ov 1 ounce to the 
quart. It should be added after t!ie sohition has been steril- 
ized, otherwise it may be decomposed. Solutions of sugar 
sliould also be administered, and voii Noorden has sugu^ested 
the use of S to 10 per cent, of levulose or grape-sugar, to be 
administered subeutaneously in salt solution ; .'>() grams (1 
ounce) of glucose in 1 liter ((|uai1) of normal salt solution or 
in ])]ain water may be administei'cd by the rectmn by the 
]\rurphy dro]) method in })hice of subeutaneously. Alcohol 
should also l^e administered, as in the milder forms. 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY EACTOR. 579 

The Reasons for Dietetic Treatment. — The question is 
often asked why the diabetic should under<^o sueh careful treat- 
ment. There are a number of answers: First, untreated 
diabetes has a tendency to })ec()me rapidly worse, and the severer 
forms terminate fatally. If the patient is allowed an unlimited 
diet, the amount of sugar circulating in the blood causes degen- 
erative changes of various organs, particularly in the nervous 
system and eyes, and numerous complications of a disagreeable 
nature arise. The continued presence of sugar in the blood 
always lowers the resistance to bacterial infections, so that 
tuberculosis is a very common termination, and boils and car- 
buncles and other similar infections are of great frequency. 
Wounds heal much better when the patient is sugar free, or 
nearly so, and the patient feels much better, and is better, and 
is capable of more exertion when properly cared for. 

The Dietetic Management of the Disease. — Before begin- 
ning the dietetic management of diabetes, the physician would 
do well to try living on a carbohydrate- free diet for a period of 
from five to ten days. In this way certain points ^vill be 
learned about diet which could never be appreciated otherwise, 
and the difficulties and desires of patients will be regarded with 
a little more sympathetic attitude of mind. In arranging the 
diet, it is very important to tell the ])atient what to eat as well 
as what not to eat, and either the patient or some member of 
the family should have the diet and the reasons for it care- 
fully explained. In hos})itals, and sometimes even in private 
practice, a s])ecially trained nurse is of incalculable value. The 
diet must be arranged with several points in view. The 
strength of the patient must be preserved and, if })ossible, 
increased ; this means that tlie protein of the body must be kept 
from diminishing. The amount of food can easily be estimated 
by calculating 85 calories to the kilogram of body-weight; a 
man of average weight would, therefore, reciuire about 2500 
calories. This varies somewhat, and a calculation is easily made. 

It should be borne in mind that the sugar excreted in the 
urine has not been available for body use, and a similar amount 
of other food must be allowed to make up for the loss. The 
same is true, but to a much less extent, of the food lost in the 
form of ketone bodies. 

Prophylactic Diet. — In diabetic families it is a wise pre- 
caution to limit the ingestion of carbohydrate food. Whether 
or not this has any effect in inhibiting the development of the 
disease is not known. In these families the maintenance of a 



580 DIET IN DISEASE. 

proper hygiene should be insisted upon. Von Noorden sug- 
gests limiting the ingestion of carbohydrates, especially in mem- 
bers of diabetic families where there is a tendency to grow fat 
as age advances. This is ])articularly apt to be the case where 
the temptations of the table are great, owing to the social posi- 
tion of the patient. 

Alcohol. — The question of alcohol for the diabetic is the 
subject of diverse opinions by the profession. Von Noorden 
favors the moderate use of alcohol for the following reasons : 

(rt) It is useful, when a fat and meat diet is ordered, in pre- 
venting disagreeable sensations after the taking of fat, and con- 
sequently assists the patient in taking his diet. 

[b) Alcohol furnishes the diabetic with a valuable fuel, as 
each gram of alcohol gives off' 7 calories of heat; or if 14.3 
gm. of alcohol are given, 10.75 gm. of fat may be omitted from 
the diet. This can be utilized only to a limited extent, as 
alcohol consumed in large quantities is productive of great 
hai'm. Sixty grams (2 ounces) of alcohol daily may be looked 
upon as an average amount, and is not to be exceeded unless 
the patient, through long years of drinking, has ac([uired a tol- 
erance for it. 

(c) Alcohol Is a good nervine and a useful heart tonic. It 
is valuable in the hands of a man who can individualize, but 
in the har.ds of the routinist and generalizer it becomes, accord- 
ing to von Noorden, a two-edged sword. 

If alcohol is used, the lighter forms of alcoholic drinks are 
to be preferred. 

One hundred grams of alcohol, for the most part without 
admixture of carbohydrates, are contained in : 

'JoOO c.c. Pilnncr beer (1 liter) — contains 35 ^'ni. carbohydrate, dextrin, and 
maltose. 

r^OO-loOO c.c. white table wine (Moselle, Rheint^au, Pfalz, Baden, etc.). 

1 l()0-i;U)0 c.c. medium sorts of claret.

DIETETIC TREATMENT. 

In outlining the diet ibr dietetic patients it is necessary to 
use a considei'abh' nniount oi' common sen.-e and judgment, in 
addition to the seientilic basis of the diet. One sliould be 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 681 

careful to see tliat the directions are snch as can be carried out 
by patients ; it often lia})pens that directions given and diets 
ordered are not within the means of tlie patients, and at other 
times the advice is given in such a way that the patient does 
not understand it, so that in attempting to follow some line of 
treatment unintelligently he is worse ofi* than if he were on 
ordinary diet. These mistakes can easily be avoided by ques- 
tioning the patient and, preferably, by a visit to his home, to see 
under what circumstances and conditions he lives. Then the 
class of case must be carefully considered ; some cases do well 
with very slight restrictions, Avhile others require not only great 
restrictions, but careful weigliing of the food, in order to see 
that the patient is not starving or given things which he cannot 
utilize. 

Various classifications have been suggested; we luive adopted 
the one made by von No(jrden, as it furnishes a very practical 
basis for ])rescribing the diet. 

Mild Forms of Glycosuria, in which the Urine Re- 
mains Free from Sugar, Notwithstanding the Ad- 
ministration of from 50 to 150 Grams of Starch. — In 
Elderly Persons. — In individuals over iifty, when from 0.5 to 
2 per cent, of sugar is excreted in the urine, the case may be 
regarded as the mildest form that can be encountered. These 
patients are often gouty or suifer from obesity. The sugar 
usually disa])pears from the urine with restriction of the carbo- 
hydrates. In these cases a close study of the starch tolerance 
is rarely necessary, and care should be taken not to frighten 
these patients into a condition of saccharophobia, as is so often 
done. All that is necessary is careful sujxTvision over the 
})atient's manner of living, while his diet may l)e regulated by 
liaving him follow very simple directions. Should it happen 
that the sugar is not controlled by these simple means, it will be 
necessary to make further restrictions, as will be outlined in the 
diet for more severe forms. In this class of cases very minute 
directions usually lead to a great deal of anxiety and depression 
on the ])art of the ])atient which it is extremely desirable to 
avoid. The first restriction should be to tell the ])atient not to 
take anything made of sugar or containing it. This includes 
sugar in coifee, tea, sweetmeats, pastries, jellies, preserves, and 
sweet desserts of all kinds. Sweet wines, especially the sweet 
champagnes, are absolutely forbidden. In addition to this, the 
starchy foods are also better restricted ; cereals, macaroni, and 
puddings, and similar dishes containing flour, should be cut off. 



582 DIET IN DISEASE. 

AYith patients accustomed to taking alcohol, it should be pre- 
i'erahly in the form of whisky and water or brandy and water, 
sherry or the ligliter sour wines. I'l l)eer is })referred, not 
more tlian one or two glasses should be allowed daily, that is, 
from one-lialf to one pint. Carbonated waters may be used, 
if desired, if they do not produce indigestion, and an alkaline 
mineral water, such as Vichy, will be found to agree with most 
of these })atients, CofPee or tea may be allowed as desired, if 
there is no otlier contraindication to their use. The jmtient is 
allowed to take liis meals witli the family, and at first may be 
allowed to eat ])r(>ad and })otatoes, according to his desire, and 
he need not concern himself about tlie starch in the ordinary 
vegetables. The amount of sugar which appears in the urine 
on such diet is trifling, usually from 10 to 20 grams daily, and 
it is better to disregard this amount tlian to cut off the carbo- 
hydrates completely. If the patient is taking much exercise, 
there may be a gradual loss of weight, and careful watch should 
be k('])t that this does not exceed 100 grams a Aveek ; if the 
])atient is not more than ordinarily fat, he should be encouraged 
to eat suilicient food to ])rotect the body from any waste what- 
ever, as these patients feel better and are better when their 
store of fit is above that desirable for the healthy individual. 
As they grow older they all gradually grow thinner, so that 
they eventually come under the head of thin ])atients. All 
thin patients of this class should be encouraged to take more 
f )od than they liave been accustomed to, especially fats. Care 
should be taken, however, not to ]")roduce any gastro-intestlnal 
disturhance by ex(^essive feeding. Butter should be eaten freely 
on bread and potatoes, and fat meats, such as bacon, should be 
taken daily. Kgii's and cheese, containing considerable amounts 
of fit, should also be allowed. W hen this diet does not sufhc(\ 
that suggested for mild cases of glycosuria in young persons, and 
f )r thf; moderately severe forms, sliould be ])ix'scribed. All 
elderly patients, unless there are contraindications, such as 
oi'ganic* diseases, sliould take sutlicient exercise, and those who 
can alford it shouM go for a few weeks each year to some suit- 
able watci'ing place. 

In Young Persons.- Cases of glycosuria in young })eo])le, 
in whom the percentage of sugar is constantly very small, are 
usually associated with or due to a nervous condition. The diet 
in these cases nuist be carefully regulated, as if the limit ol' 
tolcnmcc is overstepj)e(I, it is accompanied with marked syni})- 
tonis ; the younger the patient, the more marked are the evi- 



BISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 583 

deuces of excesses in carbohydrates. The tolerance should be 
estimated at regular intervals after the method previously men- 
tioned. Starchy foods and even sugar may be allowed well 
within the limit of tolerance, but never in sufficient quantities 
to cause glycosuria. It is a good rule in these cases to forbid 
sugar altogether ; sweet fruits, ])reserves, and similar articles 
should also be avoided, and saccharin or saxin should be used 
for sweetening such foods as the patient cannot accustom himself 
to take without sweetening. If these restrictions are made, 
bread and potatoes and many of the vegetables may be allowed 
in moderation, and the diet, while more or less strict, is not 
burdensome. In some instances milk is a valuable addition, 
and a liter of milk, or in some cases one-half that amount, may 
be added to the diet, and after this is done the starchy tolerance 
should again be determined to see how much bread, or its 
equivalent, may be added with safety. The separate paragraph 
on the subject of Carbohydrate Equivalents should be con- 
sulted and the amount determined, as bread may be interchanged 
with any of the articles on the list, according to the directions 
which are given with the list. 

\yhen the patient takes his meals at a restaurant and cannot 
have special service, the most simple directions are to forbid 
sugar, pastry, preserves, jellies, thick soups, macaroni, rice, and 
similar articles, and of the carbohydrate food to permit bread 
and potatoes, fresh vegetables, and some fresh fruits. This 
diet differs but slightly from that used in the mild cases in 
elderly persons, except that the carbohydrate tolerance should 
always be ascertained. The amount of the bread and potatoes 
which may be allowed daily should be taught the patient by 
having them weighed several times, after which he can gener- 
ally judge the correct amount by the eye. When the patient 
finds this diet unsatisfying, the variety of food allowed may be 
increased by substituting articles from the list given below, as 
conditionally allowable foods in place of part of the bread and 
potatoes, and where very extensive substitutions are made it 
is a very good plan to have some one see that the patient does 
not take too much. Milk may sometimes be added apart from 
the meals, allowing the patient to take half a liter (1 pint) on 
rising and on going to bed ; it is best to have it sipped slowly, 
about twenty minutes being consumed in taking the total 
amount. If koumiss, kefir, or buttermilk are preferred, there 
is no objection to their use. 

Von Noorden insists on this class of patients taking at least 



584 DIET IN DISEASE. 

80 to 100 grams of fat as a mininuim every twenty-four hours. 
If it is tliought desirable, a portion of the fat may be replaced 
by about 'M) grams (1 ounce) of alcohol in the form of any of 
the alcoholic beverages. The following quantities of fat-con- 
taining foods may l)e given each day : 60 grams of butter, to 
be taken with bread, bread and cheese, and ])otatoes, equal 480 
calories; 10 grams of olive oil, taken with salads or green 
vegetables, equal 90 calories ; oO grams of fatty cheese equal 
150 calories; 1 liter of milk equal o90 calories; and if 30 
grams of alcoliol, e(|ual to 210 calories, are added, the total of 
]()(I0 calories is sup])lied, and this, with tlie addition of the 
cari)ohydr;ites })reviously mentioned and the meat consumed, 
will easily bring the food-value to 2500 calories or more, unless 
the aj)])ctite is ]>articularly })oor. This class of patients is 
usually the most difficult to control, as they are generally not 
very ill and are often fond of good living; extraordinary 
patience, tact, and firmness are recjuired in dealing with them. 
Pleasing mental diversion and physical em])ioyment should be 
furnished ; care should be taken not to allow too nuich ])hysical 
exercise. Excesses of all kinds, including C)verindulgence in 
alcohol, tol)acco, coffee, and tea, are to l)e carefully avoided. 

Von Noorden reconmiends that ])atients of this class be sent 
to a mountain resort, at an altitude of from 2500 to 5000 feet, 
and while there a '^milk cure" be tried for s(n'eral weeks. 
About :> liters (quarts) of milk may be given daily, and 40 
grams of alcohol, in the form of brandy or whisky, may be 
added to the milk or taken after it. Meat, fish, eggs, and 
^vell-l)Uttered vegetables may be allowed in addition as may l)e 
needed to satisfy tlie j)atient, but all carbohydrates, including 
bi-ead and ])otat()es, should b(; avoided during the time of the 
cure. 

In these mild cases the glycosuria is usually absent, or the 
sugar only ap|)ears in small (|uantities. Kven if tlie amount 
excreted is 20 grams daily, the cure may be persisted in, as a 
rediieiion generally follows after a few days. If tlie (|uantity 
(\i\('< not le-sen, kefir or koiimi-s should be substituted for ordi- 
nary milk, :i- tiny both contain less milk-sugar, or, if jiossibh^, 
Migar-free milk, the recipe for which is given in the A])j)endix, 
may l)e tried. 

Moderately Severe Forms of Glycosuria. — These 

are the eases in which glycosuria occurs, unless all or nearly 
all the carbohydrates are withdrawn. I'lie tolerance varies 
from time to time and in different cases. Usuallv a decrease 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 585 

in the tolerance for carbohydrates occurs. This is especially 
common in children and in young persons, iu whom the decrease 
is uniformly and usually ra])idly fatid. The severe forms are 
not common in old persons. 

Von Noorden recommends that these pdticntH he mibjected to 
a three weeks' Gouri<e of complete ctbHiinence from carbohydrates 
at least tivicey and if possible three times, in a year, while in the 
intervals a, limited amount of carbohydrcde.s m,ay be allowed. 

There is no food that man can ejit that is completely free 
from carbohydrates. Meat, eggs, and the lightest kinds of 
vegetables contain minute quantities, so that the most carefully 
ordered diet will allow from 15 to 20 grams to be taken daily. 
These periods of abstinence permit wn estimation of the carl)o- 
hydrate tolerance to be made ; they strengthen the patient's 
moral tone, and remind him of the necessity of observing care 
in his diet ; and, above all, they recuperate the glycogcn-burning 
faculties of the body, enabling it to cope more successfully with 
the amount of carbohydrate ingested after the period of absti- 
nence is over. 

Five meals a day must be given, or the patient will not get 
sufficient food. The menu on page 586 will serve as a guide, 
but must be varied as much as possible every day.' The aim 
is to provide nourishment to the value of 2500 calories with 
the least possible amount of carbohydrates. 

Diet During the Period of Abstinence. — This course is l)est 
carried out in a hospital or private sanitarium, at least at first. 
The patient^ s wishes should be followed so far as is possible, 
but his diet must be carefully regulated for him. A satisfactory 
diet can be arranged only by one fomiliar with foods, tlieir com- 
position, and their preparation. For this reason special study 
is necessary, and von Noorden recommends that the physician 
himself try living on the diet restricted in carbohydrates for a 
few days. During this time he will learn much that can with 
benefit be applied to his patients. 

During the period of abstinence from carbohydrates the 
patient should rest as much as possible both mentally and phys- 
ically. A w^alk of from half an hour to an hour and a half 
may be allowed, and, in addition, the patient should be in the 
fresh air as much as possible. 

Diet in the Intervals. — When the period of abstinence is 
over, bread may be allowed, and the tolerance f )r carbohydrates 
again determined. The amount of carbohydrate food permitted

should be well below the tolerance, and, if the quantity is small, 
it is pcrliaps best ixiven as bread or potatoes, as these two articles 
of diet satisfy the patient's era vino- for carbohydrates better than 
any of the others. M'hen it is desired, however, substitution 
may be made for })art, or even all, of the bread or ])otatoes ; 
this may easily be done by consulting the table of carbohydrate

valuable, as it enables the patient to take the fats without 
gastric discomfort ; sometimes it is })()ssil)le to use less, while 
in some cases the allowance may be increased. 

The tables arranged by von Noorden (pp. ()04-60G) will be 
found of great value. These tables have been c()])ied as originally 
given ; they have been modified by various writers, but tluy^ will 
be found of great value just as they are, although they contain a 
certain number of foods scarcely suited to the average American 
palate. It will be noted that they contain the foods that may 
be allowed unconditionally, since they contain little or no carbo- 
hydrates ; second, the f )ods permitted in small (piantities, all 
containing carbohydrates, but small in amount, and useful for 
varying the diet ; third, foods allowed conditionally on account 
of the large amount of carbohydrate contained; and, fourth, a 
list of foods which are of especial value. 

The question of weighing food is always a difficult one. In 
hospitals and institutions this may be done by a s})ecial nurse 
in charge of the diet-kitchen. In private liouses it is best done 
by some one in the kitclien or some one of the household who 
wall take the necessary care. If this must be left to the patient, 
it is better to have him taught the size of the various portions 
which he mav be allowed, and let him judge them by the 
eye, rather than produce the disagreeable mental state which 
is apt to come on when the foods are weighed by the patient 
himself. 

In this class of cases a liter of milk may replace oO grams 
of bread if the patient desires it, and if grave com])lications 
are present, it may be advisable to try the elfect of a milk cure 
for several weeks. In all cases it is very important to see that 
the patient has sufficient rest, that he saves his energy, that 
exercise is taken in limited amounts and never to excess, and 
that he is protected from cold. 

The Severer Forms of Glycosuria. — These are the 
cases in which sugar appears in the urine, even if all carbo- 
hydrates are excluded from the diet. These are the severer 
forms, and are usually seen in patients under forty years of age. 
As a rule, they terminate fatally in a ie\y months, but in some 
life may be prolonged for several years. Careful dieting is of 
the greatest importance, as without it fatal termination is almost 
certain to come early, and it also prevents the onset of many 
unpleasant complications. The carbohydrates in these cases are 
of little or no value as food, and giving sugar and starches to 



588 DIET IN DISEASE. 

this class of patients has been likened to pouring water into 
a cracked vessel ; but a certain amount may be allowed to sat- 
isfy the patient^s craving and to prevent the onset of acidosis. 
AMicn it is possible the patient should be subjected to a rigid 
course of dieting, preferably in a hospital or sanitarium, three 
or lour t\TaQ< a year, each period lasting three or four weeks. 
During this time the ])atient should do neither mental nor phys- 
ical work, and should spend most of his time in the open air; 
very short walks or short drives should be allowed in some 
cases for exercise. The diet should be made up from the 
articles mentioned in Tables ]. and IV., and in some cases one 
or two dishes from Table II. may be allowed. It is a good 
plan to outline the diet, and where the patient is not taking a 
great deal of food, the meal may be made u]i of one principal 
dish, v.hich should be free from carbohydrate, and some one 
extra dish which contains a limited amount of starch, or even 
sugar, may be ;iilo\vcd. The ])atient may also be allowed 
f;ts or giTen vegetables. Cream is very valuable in these 
cjises : in 2'")() c.c. of average cream there are only G grams of 
sugar; grape-fruit will also be found of great service, as there 
are only about G grams in half of one of average size. Suuar- 
free milk may be allowed, or a good substitute for milk is one 
part cream, three parts water, with the white of one q^^^ added 
f )r each 30 c.c. of cream ; this may be slightly sweetened by 
the use of saccharin and should be well stirred before serving. 
Alcohol mav be allowed in these cases, double the amount ordi- 
narily j)ermitted, and Ix^st taken at mealtime to facilitate the 
eating of the otherwise rather difficult meal. W acidosis 
threatens, the diet should be chimged in accordance with the 
sugofcstions made under that heading, and one of the methods 
()f c(>mI)atinL: it is a trial of the oatmeal cure. 

Carbohydrate- and Protein=free Days. — \\'(/dahJc or Green 
J)(rifs. — III some cases of" diabetes it is :H]visa])le to break the 
diet with a dav in \vhich not oiilv the carbohvdrates are low, 
but the protein as well. This sometimes increases the ])ati(^nt's 
ability to utilize food. In a sense a \"egetable dav is nearly a 
starvation <lay, as has been siigLrested bv Xaunvn. As either 
starvation or a ''green " day is apt to increase the acid bodies, 
the urine shonld be tested berorehaixi, and if diacetic acid is 
present, alkalis shonld be given in connection with the diet. 
Usually sodium bicarbonate, or ecjuivalents of it, are adminis- 
tered, or sodium citrate may b(; used. The diet should consist 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 589 

almost entirely of fiits and green vegetables. The following 
will serve as a suggestion : 

Breahfast : Coffee with a small amount of cream. An omelet 
made with the yolks of three eggs ; fine herbs may be added if 
desired. Sliced tomatoes. 

Luncheon: Cup of bouillon. Asparagus or cauliflower with 
egg sauce. 

Afternoon tea : Tea or coffee or a glass of wine with a starch 
or sugar-free biscuit. 

Dinner: Cup of bouillon, sardines, spinach or other greens. 
Glass of wine or wdiisky and water. 

In place of the above the following may be used : lettuce, 
string l)eans, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, sauerkraut, and other 
varieties of greens, as kale, etc. The veiz;etables should be 
thoroughly cooked and the water changed several times. Fat 
bacon fried crisp is useful. A'ery fat pork may be cooked with 
the vegetables if desired. 

Emergency Diets. — Patients suffering from severe or even 
moderate diabetes should be instructed in regard to the diet in 
case emergency should throw them on their own resources in 
places where suitable food cannot be obtained. It frequently 
happens that diabetic coma is caused by the patient starving 
rather than take what he believes to be unsuitable food, or it 
may be caused by gastro-intestinal disturbance, brought on by 
the use of poorly prepared foods. In case of emergency the 
patient should be instructed to try and secure a diet consisting 
of eggs, cIkh^sc, bacon, butter, coffee or tea, and green vege- 
tables. If the digestion is upset, oatmeal or milk, or a com- 
bination of the two, will often be found to be the best diet the 
patient can use until he is again placed in circumstances where 
his diet may be carefully looked after. 

Diet Cures for Diabetes. — A number of so-called diet 
cures have been in use for a number of years. It should be 
borne in mind that all of tliese are methods of treatment which 
are useful in certain conditions, but that they are not ^^ cures '^ 
in the accepted sense of the word. False hopes are often en- 
tertained both by physicians and patients regarding the use of 
these special diets. The most important of these are outlined 
below : 

Oatmeal Cure. — Von Noorden first pointed out that certain 
patients suffering from diabetes would be greatly benefited by 
one or two weeks of a diet consisting very largely, if not 



590 DIET IN DISEASE, 

entirely, of oatmeal. Since his first announcement of this fact 
the oatmeal cure has been used very extensively and with very 
remarkable results. 

The cases of diabetes may be divided into five classes in their 
relation to the use of oatmeal. First, those cases in which it 
is impossible to render the urine free from sugar, notwithstand- 
iuii: a strict diet. It is in these cases that the most brilliant re- 
sults are obtained by tli(> use of oatmeal. Second, cases in 
which diabetic coma is threatened. These also yield good re- 
sults, althougli the effect may not be as lasting as in the first 
class. Third, certain cases in which the tolerance for carbo- 
hydrates is not increased by use of the oatmeal diet, but in 
which the acetone bodies are diminished by its use. Fourth, a 
certain muuber of cases in which the glycosuria is increased, 
rather than diminished, by the oatmeal diet. These are, as a 
rule, cases of moderate severity without acidosis ; in these, the 
oatmeal diet is contraindicated. Fifth, the mild cases of dia- 
betes without acidosis, in which the oatmeal diet is almost uni- 
forndy l)adly borne and in which it should not be used. It 
will be noted that in ])ractice the severest cases are the ones 
mo.-t favorably iuHuenced. 

Sometimes for a day or two there is an inca'case in the amoiuit 
of >ugar excreted ; this usually falls, and the sugar excreticm re- 
mains low for some time, varying, however, from day to day. 
In addition to this there is a marked decrease in the amount of 
diaeetie acid excreted, and sym])toms of threatened coma, which 
may have been ]iresent, frequently disa}){)ear. The patient feels 
better and is Ijctter. 

Jiarrenscheen,^ working in von Xoorden's clinic, has found 
that th(> oatmeal diet changes the ])ermeability of the kidney. 
lb' determliHHl this by testing the rate and extent of the elim- 
ination of milk-sugar given intravenously in non-dietetic lunnan 
individuals. Te^ts W(.'re made with and without oatmeal diets. 
In every case tin; oatmeal day delayed the excretion of the 
milk-sugar. 

The oatmeal is verv much better borne than similar amounts 
<ii" other earbohvdrates, but tiie good results caimot l)e obtained 
unless the oatmeal represents tlu; largest j>roportion of food C(tn- 
j-unied. .Vs a rule, the results are better when no other carbo- 
hydi'ates are taken and when no meat is eaten, but certain vari- 
aHons may be made in the oatmeal diet according to the case. 

1 r,i',cl(rmi.<r1ir ZeiUrhnJt, 191'-', xxxix., 'IWl.

It should not be used for more than one or two weeks at a time. 



as the monotony of the diet renders it almost nn])earal)le ; 
although it should be borne in mind that occasionally a patient 
is met with who is quite satisfied to continue tlie use of the oat- 
mealj with slight additions to the diet, over longer periods of 
time. 

The strict oatmeal cure is carried out by ])laclng the i)atient 
on a diet composed of oatmeal, some vegetable albumin, or white 
of egg and butter. From 250 to 300 grams of oatmeal, weighed 
dry, is cooked very thoroughly with salt and water, juid, while 
cooking, 300 grams of butter are gradually added; 100 grams 
of some vegetable albumin may be added, or the \vhites of eggs 
])eaten and strained may be mixed Avith the oatmeal as it cools. 
Roborat, a vegetable albumin made from rice by the Bremer 
Brodfabrik, is recommended as being especially palatable when 
mixed with the oatmeal. This amount of food will furnish 
over 3000 calories per day, which will be more than am})le for 
the average individual. Thirty to 50 grams of alcohol may be 
added should it be deemed necessary, and black colfee may also 
be taken. The total amount of oatmeal is divided into a num- 
ber of meals, and usually may be taken every two hours, 
although at tiuies it is advisable to lengthen this period from 
two hours and a half to even three hours. It should be 
arranged that the patient takes the required amount of food 
each day. The quantities given above will be suitable for an 
adult of average size, but it should be varied to meet the re- 
quirements of the case under treatment. A strict oatmeal diet 
can generally not be kept u]). If it should be found necessary, 
and it irenerallv will be, the monotonv mav be varied bv Inter- 
spersing days on which green vegetables are taken, such as out- 
lined in the carbohydrate- and protein-free diets, or, In addition 
to the oatmeal, on certain days green vegetables and carbo- 
hydrate-free foods may be given. Occasionally, a small amount 
of meat or fish may be added. 

On this strict diet results are quite remarkable,' but it should 
be borne in mind that return to ordinary diet should be cau- 
tiously made lest the acetone bodies increase at an alarming 
rate. In some cases it is not necessary to use quite as strict a 
diet as the one just outlined, but the combination of oatmeal, 
meat or fish, green vegetables and carbohydrate-free foods may

ber, 1905. 



592 DIET IN DISEASE. 

be arranged, having about one-half the food-vahie in oatmeal. 
This is niiK'h less tedious, and while the results are not as 
satisfactory, they are often sufficiently good to warrant the 
procedure. 

The Soy Bean. — The composition and use of this bean are 
noted elscNvhere under tiuit heading, and also under Infant Feed- 
ing. A large number of recipes will also be found in the 
.Vppendix. The bean contains al)out <S ])er cent, of sugar and 
no ,-rarch, and furnishes a large amount of available protein and 
fat. Wii have used the soy bean both in pre])arations made 
from the bean itself and from the flour. In the mild cases it 
may be given in ])lace of other food simply to vary the diet. 
In severe cases the patient may be placed upon a restricted diet 
and the soy bean allowed in considerable quantities. The bean 
seems to have the same effect as the use of oatmeal, in that it 
lessens decidedly the (juantity of sugar excreted. A\'e have ob- 
served this uniformly in all the cases in which we have tried it 
up to date. A patient on strict diabetic diet, who is excreting 
a certain junount of sugar, will excrete less sugar when the soy 
bean is added to the diet. It seems to be of particular value in 
severe cases. 

In addition ^o this action it is a very valuable f^od, both on 
account of its nutritious ])r()perties and owing to the fact that 
it may be prej)ared in a mimber of dilferent ways, and so serves 
to vary the diet. 

Milk Cure. — Xumerous observers have noted that a strict 
milk diet will either diminish or even cau>e glycosuria to dis- 
.-ippear entirely in from t\venty-f )ur to foi'ty-eiglit hours in most 
cax's of this disease. ^V certain nun^ber ol' ])atients are entirely 
relieved by means of a milk cure, and remain so for some time 
alter again being ])laced u])on a diet containing a considerable 
iiinount of carbohydi'ate material. In some forms of severe 
diabetes a half liter of milk is well borne without increasing the 
glycosuria. Individuals dilfer in the way in which they react 
to milk-sugar, and a study must be made of each pati(>nt. 
\annvn has pointed out that the unfavorable effects of milk can 
only be detected after a lengthy and continuous use of this food. 
Milk should not l)e given in the mild forms of diabetes in which 
glycosuria appears after it has been given. A^on Noorden 
admonishes against the Ur^i' of a strict milk cure in all cases of 
dialx'tes, even when the glyco.^uri:i does not appear after taking 
a^ much as 4 litres of milk daily, as it may cause an intensi; 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 593 

anorexia which may be difficult to overcome. He advises that 
in those cases of diabetes in which glycosuria is absent on a 
milk diet to vary the diet with kefir, buttermilk, kumiss, and 
cream. Hutchinson's sugar-free milk may also be used. (See 
Eecipes.) We have rarely found it advisable to place any of 
our patients on an exclusive milk diet, except in those severe 
cases of diabetes in which diacetic acid is present in the urine 
and in which the patient is threatened with the onset of diabetic 
coma, or in which this condition has already set in. On the 
other hand, we have used from one-half to one litre in many 
cases in addition to other allowable foods, often with excellent 
results. The urine must be examined at regular intervals 
whenever milk is being given in such cases. 

Potato Cure. — Mosse first advised the potato cure as a means 
of treating patients suffering with diabetes. His plan is to 
replace all carbohydrates by potatoes for a period of several 
weeks. Patients are to receive 1500 grams of potatoes, replacing 
500 grams of wheat bread, inasmuch as, according to his exper- 
iments, patients could tolerate from two and one-half to three 
times as much of potatoes (weighed raw) as they could of 
wheat bread. Potatoes are relatively poor in carbohydrates, 
containing from 16 to 22 per cent, of starch, whilst wheat 
bread contains about 60 per cent. During the time of the 
potato treatment no other carbohydrates are to be consumed. 
Moss6 found a marked diminution in the glycosuria and poly- 
uria while the patient was taking the potato starch, as well as 
a diminution in thirst and an increase in strength. He also 
observed that a certain degree of tolerance for wheat bread was 
produced after the patient had been on the potato cure for 
several days. He attributes the beneficial effect of this diet to 
the large proportion of water and potassium salts contained in 
the potato. The large quantity of fluid diminishes the thirst, 
while the potassium salt appears to improve the general nutri- 
tion. In 23 diabetic patients to whom diets of bread and 
potato were alternately given, an advantage in favor of the 
bread was found in only 1 case. 

Offer has confirmed the observation of Moss6, and von 
Noorden, too, extols this plan of treatment, and recommends 
that the potato need not only be given as the only carbohydrate 
food in diabetes, but also that it may be utilized to replace a 
certain portion of the bread ; for instance, in a diet in which 
75 to 125 grams of wheat bread are allowable, an amount of 

38 



594 DIET IX DISEASE. 

potato represented bv one-third of this quantity can he substi- 
tuted for it; so that in this instance 75 to 125 grams of potato 
can be c(jnsunied daily, leaving as much as 50 to 85 grams of 
bread still to be eaten. In this way the variety of carbohydrate 
food is increased, and at the same time large quantities of fat 
can be consumed in the form of butter, which may be added to 
the potatoes. The potato has an additional advantage, in that 
it lends variety in furnishing carbohydrate food, inasmuch as it 
can be prepared in various ways — baked, boiled, fried, mashed, 
etc. 

In our own observations with the use of the potato cure in 
the treatment of diabetes, we have followed the methods sug- 
gested by von Noorden, replacing a portion of the bread by this 
form of food. 

Yolk Cure. — Stern ^ reconmiends the ingestion of from 10 to 
40 yolks of eggs a day, together with a small amount of protein 
and some green vegetables, in cases of diabetes in which there 
is acetonuria. He has obtained very satisfactory results, and 
states that this method of feeding is usually well borne. 

Rye Bread in Diabetes. — Lidwell recommends the use of 
rye bread, particularly in mild diabetes in middle-aged or old 
persons. He found that it checked the craving for carbohydrate 
food, and that it was not taken in as large quantities as other 
breads. Because of this and the fact that it contains less 
digestible starch, it was found to diminish the glycosuria. It 
has an additional advantage that it is cheaj) and (;an be used in 
f)ractice among the poor. The urine must be watched in all 
cases where rye bread is being used, as no rules can be formu- 
lated as to how any food will affect any given patient. 

Mineral Waters. — In diabetes, especially in the milder 
forms, «'i visit to one of the watering-places where alkaline 
or alkaline sulphur waters are to be had is often of great 
benefit. Tliose most highly recommended are Carlsbad, 
Xeuenahr, and Vichy, although many ])atients prefer Marien- 
bad. There is a great differen(^e of o|)inion regarding the value 
of certain s{)rings in diabetes, l^hysieians who live at the vari- 
ous springs are apt to extol the merits of tiieir es|>ecial waters. 
P^rerichs noted that marked benefit followed often a visit to 
C'arlsbad or to one of the other spas, but that sugar would usu- 
allv reap{)ear in the urine aft<'r sevend months' time. He also 
note<l the fact that the improvement following the first visit 

^ AincricdH Medici iit, lk'Ci-n\])vr '•■>, 11U)4. 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 595 

was (T^reater than after subsequent visits. Minkowski, Seegen, 
and Naunyn recommend Carlsbad most higlily. Apparently a 
greater amount of benelit on a less rigid diet may be obtained 
at a spa than at home, even when the same water is taken. 
This may be due in large measure to the regularity of the life 
led at the resort. 

Mineral waters taken at home are of comparatively little 
value, and some authorities have seen no benefit follow their 
employment, whereas others recommend that those who are 
unable to visit Carlsbad or any of the other watering-places 
take a bottle of w^armed Carlsbad water every twenty-four 
hours. 

The mild and the moderately severe cases are the only ones 
that receive any benefit from the use of mineral waters. The 
severe cases derive no benefit from the treatment, and a long 
journey may do positive harm to a patient in the advanced 
stage of the disease. 

Diabetes in Children. — This is usually of severe or mod- 
erately severe type, and in a great majority of cases the disease 
tends to grow worse and to terminate fatally. It occasionally 
happens that a mild form of the disease is seen, from which re- 
covery may eventually take place. A certain number of tliese 
mild cases are probably glycosuria from various causes, and un- 
doubtedly some of the favorable cases are nothing but elementary 
glycosuria. 

The occurrence of glycosuria in a child is a matter of very 
grave concern. The case should be studied with a view of de- 
termining whether or not it is diabetes, and once having made 
the diagnosis, the very great gravity of the disease should be 
impressed upon the parents, and very strict dieting should be 
undertaken. Elxactly the same ])rocedure is followed as in 
adults. The carbohydrate intolerance should be determined, 
and tlie presence or absence of acidosis also observed. It was 
formerly thought that diet offered little chance of bettering 
these cases, but life may be prolonged in many of them for con- 
siderable periods, and sometimes the disease tends to lessen in 
its intensity. Perhaps one reason that such uniforndy bad re- 
sults have been obtained is that strict diets have rarely been 
carried out over sufficient length of time to determine their 
value. The average child under ordinary circumstances is ex- 
tremely difficult to regulate in the matter of diet. The disease 
tends to get worse rapidly when the dietetic treatment is aban- 



596 DIET IN DISEASE. 

doned or improperly carried out, and cases which have been 
going on in a perfectly satisfactory manner sometimes have a 
fatal termination brought about by a few days or a week of 
careless eating, coupled with unusual excitement or exercise, as, 
for example, taking trips, which is often done with the idea of 
bettering the child's condition. 

Diabetes in Young Adults. — These are difficult cases 
to manage, and are usually unsatisfactory ones. The diet must 
be carefully selected, and while the carbohydrates should always 
be kept below tlie limit of tolerance, there should be frequent 
periods of strict dieting. These last are best carried out in an 
institution, and the patient should be instructed carefully as to 
the life that he is to lead. Alcoholic drinks should be used 
with caution, and smoking allowed only in great moderation if 
at all. 

Young diabetics should not be sent to watering-places, for 
they derive but little benefit from the visit, and are inclined 
to acquire a false impression as to the necessity for constant 
care of themselves ; or in the belief that a yearly visit to the 
spring is all that is needed, the)" may grow careless in the 
intervals. 

Diabetes and Disease of the Kidneys. — A not in- 
frequent complication of diabetes is the contracted kidney. 
When this complicates a case of diabetes, the difficulty of 
feeding the patient is greatly increased. Von Noorden recom- 
mends that the protein be cut down to about 100 grams (3 
ounces) a day, this amount being made up from the various 
kinds of meat, milk, mild cheese, eggs, and the legumes. The 
amount contained in fresh vegetables is disregarded. The arti- 
chjs of food mentioned in the section on Chronic Interstitial 
Nephritis as being irritating to the kidney siiould be avoided. 
Fresh vegetiibles, fruits, and the unirritiiting fats should be 
used as freely as possible. 

Milk should not Ik; given too freely on account of the bulk of 
the fluid. The heart slujuld be shielded against overwork, as 
in these cases a failing heart is possibly the greiitest danger. 
The amount of fluid tiiken should be reduced to H <>r IJ liters 
daily. In these cases vo?i Noorden reconnnends ])articularly 
the use of cream in as large amounts as possible. From time 
to time — say every half year — a period of water-drinking cover- 
ing thre(! or four weeks may be allowed. For this pur{)ose the 
alkaline mineral waters are j)referable. During this period a

clumge of climate or of the place of residence may benefit the 
patient. 

In diabetics with marked symptoms of nephritis the diet 
should be such as is indicated to meet the kidney disorder, for 
the danger from nephritis and its consequences is, as a rule, 
greater than that from the diabetes. The selection of a suitable 
diet for these patients is often a difficult task. 

Diabetes and Obesity. — Diabetes and obesity are in 
many cases intimately related. In the majority of instances 
the glycosuria is mild or only moderately severe, and may gen- 
erally be controlled aisily by the diet and management previ- 
ously suggested for these cases. It must be borne in mind that 
the diet and life are to be so regulated as to prevent any further 
increase in weight ; reduction cures, however, must not be 
undertaken unless the patient^s health is interfered with, and 
never for the sake of appearance. Diabetics bear reduction 
cures poorly, and weakness of the heart, sleeplessness, and often 
albuminuria may follow their employment. Von Noorden 
recommends an increase in physical work, rather than a starva- 
tion diet, when it becomes necessary to reduce a patient. The 
same observer also calls particular attention to the fact that 
both physicians and patients are apt to disregard the presence 
of small amounts of sugar in the urine when the patient is 
obese. This he regards as a serious error, for the small amount 
is easily controlled by proper diet, and the degenerative proc- 
esses that may be fostered by long-continued saturation of the 
tissues with sugar may thus be avoided. Moreover, if this is 
not done, the patient is apt to develop arteriosclerosis, furuncu- 
losis, cataract, contracted kidney, a tendency to brain hemor- 
rhage, and even gangrene. 

Diabetes and Gout. — When this combination of dis- 
eases occurs, both aifections are usually of the milder forms, 
particularly the gout. The diet may easily be regulated by 
cutting off all sweets, reducing the proteins to a moderate 
amount, and allowing green vegetables, fruit, and fat. There 
is wide diversity of opinion regarding the use of alcohol. In 
diabetes without gout it may be allowed ; when gout does exist, 
it is better to withdraw alcohol, except in the case of habitues, 
when the sudden withdrawal may be followed by extreme 
weakness of the heart. 

Diabetes and Digestive Disorders. — Constipation 
should be avoided by the free use of vegetables in the diet, 



598 DIET IN DISEASE. 

and where tlie tendency to costiveness is not too great it can 
usually be overcome in this manner. Salines and similar 
cathartics should not, as a rule, he used. Von Noorden recom- 
mends the following prescription : 

B Pulv. rliei radicls ^iv (lo.O). 

Sodii bicai-bonat., 

Sulf.florum aa .:;ij (7.5). 

Sro. — One-tifth to one toaspoonful given in the evening. 

Catarrh of the stomach and similar digestive disturl)ances 
are among the difficult conditions that the physician has to 
encounter in the management of dial)etics. In tlu^ eifort to 
overcome the stomach or bowxl distni'bance the s]K'cial diet of 
the diabetic must often be neglected for a time. The diet may 
be difficult to arrange, and in these cases as near a middle 
ground as possible nuist be arranged. The return to the re- 
stricted diet must always be made cautiously and graduallv. A 
visit to Carlsbad or to a similar watering-place may often be of 
th(} greatest benefit to these ])atients. 

Diarrhea is not, as a rule, more troublesome in tlu^ dia])etic 
than in the ordinary individual, but if it displays a tendency to 
become chronic, pains should be taken to cure the condition, for 
it will not only weaken the patient, but may also tend to bring 
on a (.'omatose state. Von Noorden recommends that patients 
with a tendency to diarrhea take small doses of calcium car- 
})onate two or three times a day. Alcohol should be u&ed 
sparingly or not at all. Tea and red wine are the most suitable 
drinks for tins class of ])atients. If these simple measures do not 
check the diarrhea, the })atient should be put to bed and moist 
warm applications made to the al)domen. The diet should consist 
of barley gruel and the like, with tea or red wine as a beverage. 
So far as the diet is concerned, the diabetes may l)e disregarded 
until the diarrhea has been cured. Opium may also be ])rescribcxl. 
The return to the diabetic diet should be made gradually. 

In some cases of diabetes fat is not digested, that which is 
given Ixiing passed in the stools pra(;tically unchanged. In 
these cases tln^re is u.-ually disease of the ])ancreas or of its 
duct. 'I'his may, however, occur in severe diabetes when the 
pancH'as is not involved. 'J'hese f)atients lose weight very 
raj)i(lly. The diet in these cas<'s must be made up of as nuicli 
prot(*in as th(! patient can take, and tlu; amount of alcohol 
preseribc<l must also be increasciL .Meats of various kinds, 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY E ACTOR. 599 

cheese, eggs, somatose, luitrose, tro})on, and similar preparations 
may be tried, and green vegetables of every variety allowed in 
as large a quantity as the patient desires. 

Diabetes and Surgical Operations. — Prior to opera- 
tions upon patients sulfering from diabetes, it is not W(^ll to have 
them undergo any very strict starvation, on accoimt of the dan- 
ger of producing acidosis. If the patient is to l)e etherized, we 
believe it would be a good ])lan to allow about 100 grams of 
carbohydrate food in addition to what the patient is already 
getting, and in the severer cases part of this might be sugar. 
Alkalis might also be administered to advantage prior to the 
administration of the anesthetic. After the operation water 
should be given freely ; Yichy water, to which bicarbonate of 
soda has been added, if acidosis threatens. During the period 
of healing the best results will be obtained if the patient is on 
as strict a diet as possible. If the })atient is free from sugar, 
the wounds always heal much more rapidly than when there is 
glycosuria. 

SUBSTITUTES FOR SUGAR. 

Various substances are used in place of sugar to sweeten the 
food and drink of the diabetic. Many of these are sold under 
trade names, as ^^ Crydallose ^' and '^ Diabetin.'' Preparations 
of inuUn, of inodte, of laannite, and of frult-suf/ar have also 
been suggested as being less injurious than cane-sugar. 

Glycerin is sometimes used, but has many opponents, among 
them beino; Senator and Frerichs. It leaves a sweet taste in 
the mouth and may have a decidedly laxative effect. 

Saccharin (benzoyl-sulphonic-imid) is used largely; it has an 
exceedingly sweet taste, and may be procured in tablets that are 
equal in sweetening power to an ordinary lump of sugar. If 
taken in quantities not exceeding five grains a day, it is harm- 
less. The following is a much-quoted formula given by James 
Stewart : 

Sodium bicarbonate gr. xxx. 

Saccharin . . . gr. xl. 

Mannite ."^xijss. 

Make 100 pastilles. One will sweeten a cup of coliee. 

Garantose (sodium benzoyl-sulphonic-imid — Heyden) is a 
much more soluble preparation than saccharin. 

Duldn (paraphenatolcarbamid — Heyden) is in common use 



600 DIET IN DISEASE. 

in Germany for sweetening the food and drink of diabetics, and 
is recommended by many of the highest authorities. In the 
small quantities in which it is prescribed it is harmless, but in 
the large quantities that have been given experimentally it gives 
rise to such symptoms as icterus, etc. More than half a gram 
(8 grains) should not be given in any one day. It may be 
procured in tablets containing 0.025 gram each. Each of these 
has the sweetening power of an ordinary lump of sugar. Some 
patients prefer the taste of dulcin to that of saccharin, and 
vice versa. 

Saxin is a coal-tar product used to sweeten the food of the 
diabetic, and is said to be six hundred times sweeter than 
sugar ; many patients prefer its taste to that of the other 
preparation. It may be obtained in tablet form. 

Sugar-free marmalades, jellies, and jam are manufactured by 
Callard and Co. They also prepare preserved fruits for diabetics. 
These fruits are said to contain less than 2 per cent, of sugar. 

SUBSTITUTES FOR BREAD.i 

a Torrified ^' Bread. — Thin slices of bread are toasted until 
very dark brown or almost black. It is supposed that the 
stiux'h and gluten are partially decomposed by the heat. This 
will almost certainly not be eaten to excess by the patient, and 
Williamson states that this is probably its only advantage. 

Gluten bread, introduced over fifty years ago by Bouchardat, 
has always been popular in France. This bread is made from 
gluten flour from which the starch has been washed out. The 
gluten flours on the market differ very much in the amount of 
starcli which they contain, a fact that can be illustrated by test- 
iuL^ with an iodin solution. 

Directions for making gluten brciid accompany the packages 
of Hour. 

llran bread, made from bran flour, is also to be recommended. 
The bran must be ground quite flue, or it will not be digested. 

Almond cakes and cocoa mi f coLrs are of considerable value 
as bread substitutes. K<)nig gives the following analysis of 
sweet almonds :

' Kecipes for these will he found in the Ap))on(lix. 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 601 

Aleuroruit is a vegetable albumin flour made by Dr. Hund- 
hausen from wheat. It is a light-yellowish powder, and con- 
tains from 80 to 90 per cent, of albumin and only 7 j)er cent, 
of carbohydrate. It was recommended in diabetes by Ebstein, 
who suggests that it be mixed with wheat flour. His formula 
contains considerable starch, — i. e., about one-half the amount of 
ordinary bread ; and most patients prefer to have half the quan- 
tity of wheat bread to a double allowance of aleuronat bread. 

Buns and cakes may also be made with the aleuronat flour, 
and they are very palatable if made with the addition of cocoa- 
nut powder, as suggested by Williamson. Eecipes will be 
found in the section devoted to that subject. 

Inulin biscuits have been suggested by Kiilz and others. 
Their expense is a great objection to their use. Inulin is 
obtained from the roots of elecampane. 

Peanut flour has also been used with success in making 
various dishes for the diabetic. 

A large number of diabetic flours, breads, biscuit, and other 
sugar and starch-free foods are prepared by Callard and Co. of 
London. 

Diabetic Floods. — Numerous diabetic foods are on the 
market, some of which contain small quantities of starch, but 
many of which contain large quantities, that are sold with state- 
ments which are not always strictly true. 

Many of the so-called diabetic flours are made from wheat 
flour by washing out part of the starch and then drying. 
Various other cereals and the seeds of various legumes are also 
used. Almonds and some other nuts, and also casein prepared 
from skimmed milk are frequently used. Care should be taken 
to obtain fresh products, as many of the foods are packed in 
pasteboard boxes, may be infected with moulds or insects, 
and also change somewhat in their composition, due the evapo- 
ration or absorption of water. 

The following table, from an analysis made under the direction 
of A. L. Winton in a Connecticut Agricultural Station, is very 
instructive, and the composition of most of the diabetic foods 
that are sold can be determined at a glance :

TABLE II. 

Second (irouji. — Foods Pcrrnissihlc hi Moderate Quantiiies. 

These contain carbohydrates, but in so little amounts that they need not Ik? 
considered, and demand no compensation by a reduction in the allowance of 
biead. Son)e of the articles contain a rather large j)ercentage of carbohydrates, 
but the abs<^lute quantity in which they are consumed is small. 

The amounts here given have l)een fixed by [)ractical experience, and it

will seldom be found necessary to increase them. Of the dishes here given, 
when they are allowed at all, only a few — from two to four — are to be selected 
each day. It is possible in this way to secure a great variety in the patient's 
dietary.

TABLE IIL 

Third Group. — Conditionally Allowable Foods. 

The condition under which dishes from the following table are permitted is 
that an equivalent shall be deducted from the allowance of bread. The amounts 
given below are the equivalents of 50 grams of white bread, containing about 
30 grams of starch. Advantage is taken of the fact that larger amounts of 
certain carbohydrates (cane-sugar, milk-sugar, fruit-sugar, etc.) may be allowed 
than of starch. Some of the dishes given in the preceding table appear again 
here because, if they are eaten in large quantities, an account must be taken 
of the carbohydrates which they contain : 

1 liter of milk (sweet, sour, or buttermilk). 

1^ liters of kumiss, prepared in the Russian way. 

1 to I2 liters of ketir, fermented for at least two days and prepared without 
the addition of sugar.' 

1 liter of cream. 

60 grams of rye bread, Graham bread, or Hamburg pumpernickel. 

65 grams of Westphalian pumpernickel. 

100 grams of aleuronat bread, jirepared after Ebstein's formula (containing 
27.5 per cent, of carbohydrates and 32 percent, of vegetable albumin; the 
aleuronat breads are very variably compounded).

A handful of walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, or Brazil nuts. 
^ liter of beer of any sort.

TABLE IV. 

FourfJi Group. — EspeciaUy Valuable Foods. 

The great value of the following articles, of which, however, there is but a 
sinall choice, is due in part to the high ])ercentage of protein and in part to 
that of fat. The })roportion of albumin and fat is given for each 100 grams 
ot the food-substance. Home contain carbohydrates also, the percentage of 
whicli is given for the sake of completeness, but its nutritive value is not 
counted.

The Carbohydrate Percentages in Common Foods. 

— The following; tables will he fouiul of great use in varying 
the diet for diabetic patients. The articles are arranged accord- 
ing to the amount of carbohydrate contained, and the amount 
to be used can be determined by comparing the carbohydrate 
content with that of wheat bread, in which the tolerance for 
starch is usually expressed :

Carbohydrate Equivalents. — Various tables have been 
advised to show at a trlance the amoimts of different articles of 
diet that can be substituted for given amounts of ordinary wheat 
bread. One of the uKjst practical of these is that of Carter ( The 
Medical Record, 1911), which shows the amounts as compared 
witli 7.5 to 75 grams (\ to 2 J ounces). The carbohydrate toler- 
ance is determined usually by giving wheat bread, and sliould it 
be desired to convert this quantity into other articles of food the 
quantities can l)e determined. Tiie ecpiivalents for any given 
day should not exceed the total (juautity of white ])read that 
woukl be allowed. For exam})l(', if it has })een determined 
that 45 grams of white l)read could bo allowed, the following 
diet should be substituted, as it represents the carbohydrate 
ecpiivalents :

GOUT AND GOUTINESS. 

Sydenham said : " Great eaters are liable to gout, and of these 
the costive more especially. Eating as they are used to e;it 
when in full exercise, their digestion is naturally impaired. 
Even in these cases simple gluttony and the free use of food, 
although common incentives, by no means as freqy^ently pave 

39

the way for p^oiit as reckless, inordinate drinking." This state- 
ment is as near tlie trnth as anything that has been said since. 

Tlie causes of gout are to be considered then as due to the 
foHowing : 

1. Alcoholism, of which Garrod wrote : " With an absence 
of alcohol in any shape, coupled with an absence of hereditary 
])redisposition derived from alcohol-drinking ancestors, gout 
would practically be unknown." 

'2. Overeating, which some observers have placed on a level 
with overdrinking ; the one usually, however, accompanies the 
other in those who suffer from " exposure to luxury." Food 
unearned by ])hysical exertion is the food that usually causes 
the trouble, although gout occasionally occurs in athletes who 
take an abundance of exercise. The latter class of patients 
generally suifer for the sins of their ancestors, for gout follows 
the old Mosaic law. 

o. Heredity. — Gout, as is well known, is a family disease, 
and ])resents itself either as true gout or in the form of an 
arthritic or rheumatic tendency. 

4. Indigestion is a potent factor in the causation of gout. 
It lias been said that '^ Gout is generally acquired with the help 
of a sound stomach," but the stomach rarely remains sound for 
any length of time. 

o. Constipation is a factor not to be overlooked. The gouty 
not only {)rove to be costive, but suffer from tlie effects of the 
constipation, a fact to be borne in mind in arranging diet-lists 
for the gouty. 

('). Workers in lead are especially prone to gout. Mental 
work, wliile it does not cause gout, may lead to it indirectly. 
As Ewart says : " It does not fulfil the letter of the law that we 
shall earn our own bread by the sweat of our brow." 

Tlie ])hysiology of gout is still shrouded in considerable mys- 
tery. As early as 1S-1<S Garrod showed that the blood of gouty 
pci-.-ons contained abnormal (piaiitities of uric acid. This has 
been confirmed by many observers. A discussion of uric acid, 
and the various theories concerning it and gout need not be 
(•(tii-idcrcd here, as the ideas of investigators have changed rap- 
idly during the j)ast few years, and doubtless will continue to 
do so. Those interested should consult the recent articles by 
I>riig.-ch and Scliittenhelm, Schmidt, Magnus- Levy, and others. 

It is agreed tlnit the essential factor in the production of gout 
is a disturbance of purin metabolism. (Sec same.) The purin 
bodies are a grouji of chemical compounds containing C^N^. 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 611 

Uric acid is the most ini])()rtant of these, but there are others, 
as xanthiii, hypoxanthin, calleiii, thein, theobromin, guauiii, and 
adeiiin. The j)iirin bodies found in the urine may be either 
endogenous in origin, that is, those formed in the body ; or 
exogenous, as those taken in the body as food. Purin metab- 
olism is sn})posed now to be carried out tlirough the agency 
of several different enzymes whicli are in various organs of the 
body, and there are different enzymes for each form of ])urin. 
The endogenous purins are formed from tlic catabolism of the 
nuclei of the cells, and this goes on quite independent of the 
purin bodies introduced in the food, so tliat even if a gouty 
individual is kept on purin-free food for months, uric acid may 
be demonstrated in appreciable quantities. In normal indi- 
viduals fed on })urin-free diet the blood is free from uri(; acid. 

In gouty individuals there is apparently a slow formation of 
uric acid from nucleic acids ; a slow destruction of uric acid ; 
delayed excretion of the uric acid through the kidney, and as a 
consequence of these an increase in the monosodium urate in 
the blood to even more than 8 milligrams per 100 c.c. During 
the attack of gout the amount of nric acid in the urine is 
increased, but just before an acute attack and just after it the 
amount is decreased. Uric acid is also found to be increased 
in the blood in pneumonia, chronic interstitial ne})hritis, and 
myelogenous leukemia. 

In the diagnosis of gout the estimation of the urate in the 
blood and the quantitative estimation of the uric acid in the 
urine, on a diet free from purin nitrogen and after the addition 
of purin-containing foods, have been found of value. The 
method of von Noorden is to place the patient on a purin-free 
diet, and estimate the endogenous uric acid in the urine. Then 
400 grams of beef, weighed raw, are given on two successive 
days, 150 grams at breakfast and 2O0 grams at noon. Von 
Noorden estimates the 400 grams of beef to contain 0.24 gram 
of purin bodies, half of which disappears in the body, but the 
remainder should be eliminated in the urine either as uric acid 
or purin bases. Normally, the elimination of this amount takes 
place during the two days of the experiment or a day or two 
later, but in gout there may be a considerable retardation. If 
there is retention of purin nitrogen in the body, the amount of 
food containing it should be reduced. A patient will often 
tolerate smaller amounts with complete elimination, when larger 
amounts cause retention. The tolerance and the allowance of 
purin-containing foods may thus be determined, and the case 



612 



DIET IN DISEASE. 



studied much in the same way as the tolerance for carbohydrate 
as followed in diabetes. A simple method of estimating the 
uric acid in the urine is by the purinometer of Walker Hall, 
which depends upon the precipitation of the uric acid with a 
silver solution, and the reading of the amount of settled pre- 
cipitate in a specially graduated tube. The exact degree of 
accuracy of this method has yet to be determined. 

The principal foods containing purin bodies are meats, fish, 
peas, beans, asparagus, onions, mushrooms, tea, coffee, choco- 
late, and perhaps oatmeal. Milk, cheese, butter, and eggs do 
not contain purin bodies. Eggs cause an increase in the amount 
of uric acid excreted, while alcohol affects individuals differently 
in this respect. 

The following tables, taken from Walker HalPs book, " The 
Purin Bodies of Food Stuffs,^' show the amounts of purin bodies 
in various food materials :

Certain meats appear richer in purins than others but with 
the exception of liver and sweetbread, when the amount of each 
sort necessary to provide the requisite amount of protein or the 
feeling of satisfaction, is calculated, there is not much difference 
between the species.

The purin bodies in coffee, tea, and chocolate are largely 
methyl purins, and they do not undergo the same metabolic 
changes as the others, and they need not be excluded from the 
diet of the gouty as rigorously as the other forms. Some au- 
tliorities, however, advise that caffein-free coffee be used. Alco- 
hol is apparently injurious on account of its retarding purin 
metabolism. There is a difference of opinion concerning the 
purin content of oatmeal. 

Another suggestion that has been made by Colin is to avoid 
foods containing much sodium and to use foods containing po- 
tassium, as rice. These potassium-containing foods, he believes, 
act by aiding in the excretion of the sodium. The same is ac- 
complished by the use of potassium salts and by acids. Large 
doses of hydrochloric acid taken over long periods of time have 
been strongly recommended. The tendency of modern tliera])y 
in gout is away from the use of alkalis as formerly given. This 
is particularly true of the treatment of those cases in which there 
is subacidity. 



6U DIET IN DISEASE. 

Exercise, if ])ro})erly supervised, is very useful, and the drink- 
in ti; f)f large quaTitities of vrater is usually advised, as it aids 
materially in excretion. It may be taken hot when the stomach 
is empty if it interferes with digestion or if there is a tendency 
to obesity. The (juantity of fluid administered should be duly 
considered with regard to the lieart action. 

The arrangement of the diet for the gouty is attended by 
many dilHculties. ^vlany gouty persons are well-to-do, and 
have been accustomed to rich food, and they do not care to give 
it uj). They sutler from many idiosyncrasies, some real, but 
more fancied. There can, however, be no question that what 
will cause trouble in one gouty patient may be taken with im- 
punity by anothei'. \i tlu; patient is all'ected with any other 
disease in addition to his gout, this will also have to be taken 
into account in arranging the diet. Heart disease, arteriosclero- 
sis, and chronic ne])hritis are not uncommon, particularly in 
the cases of long standing. 

In a general way it may be stated that a varied and simple 
diet of ])lainly prepared foods is the best. 

Svndenham wrote : ''The more closelv I have thouofht upon 
gout, the more I have referred it to indigestion." Tliis sug<»:ests 
the s(H'on(l indication — the relief of dyspepsia. Anything that 
will im})rove the digestion of the ])atient will add to his comfort. 

Preventive Treatment. — Individuals with a gouty tend- 
ency will do well to fallow a dietary such as is suggested for 
chronic gout. ( "hildren of goutv parents or of gouty ancestry 
-hoiild r('ceiv(^ a carefully regulated diet from childhood. Sugars 
and swc't- should be used s})ari!iglv, alcohol should be prohib- 
il'd, and tea ruid coffee taken moderately, if at all, and not until 
some time after })uberty. In a general way a simple varied diet 
should be allowed in which the purin nitrogen dcjes not ligiu'c too 
prominently. Rest riet ions in diet are not apt to be folio w(h1 unless 
there lias been an attack of the di-case or of one of the allied af- 
iections, as a,-thma oi* eczema. Outdoor exercise Is of great help. 
I )i(f in Acute Gout. — Th(^ diet in the i/ounr/ and the jtletlioric

In a primary paroxystn the ibod should be light, and ])refern- 
bly in a fluid ibrm. Plent\' of water should be given, and in 
tlie full blooded there is no objection to withholding all food for 
a .-holt time. In the weak and the aged food should be given 
at regulai- intervals : milk, bread and milk, fai'inaceous foods, 
especially rice. Sago and tapioca and .-imilar foods may be 
used. l\ggs may be added next if tluy agree, and vegetable 
soups, jtotato, carrot.-, and cauliflower may be given. The 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET JS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 615 

return to the regular diet should be made gradually, adding butter, 
cream, bacon, fruit, then boiled (white) fish. The ])lainer, more 
easily digested meats may be added last of all. All the foods 
containing purins in any quantity should be avoided for some 
time. If it is possible to estimate the jnirin tolerance, as sug- 
gested above, it will give a good guide as to the amount to be 
allowed. If this cannot be done the diet will have to be reg- 
ulated according to clinical observation. Purin fast days, from 
one to six a week, according to the condition of the patient and his 
excretion, is an easy and convenient way of controlling the intake 
of purin foods. In alcoholics, shoidd it be deemed necessary, 
small amounts of well matured, pure wliisky, well diluted with 
water, may be given. The minimum amount needed should be 
used, and none at all if it can be dispensed with without producing 
serious symptoms. Moderate drinkers and temperate people 
should not take alcohol at all. 

Diet in Chronic Gout and Goiitiness. — The gouty patient should 
be given definite direction as to what is allowable, and if he can 
be taught to have an eye to the future he may be permitted to 
manage his own diet to a very large extent. As has been well 
said, " A man after forty is either a fool or his owm physician.'^ 

To begin with, in every case forbid all rich, fancy, and indi- 
gestible dishes, as well as all foods known to disagree with the 
patient. All rich sauces and all poorly prepared foods should 
be warned against. 

The aim in the gouty is to give sufficient protein food, but the 
exact amount that produces the best results will doubtless always 
be an individual question, although eventually studies in gout 
metabolism may throw much light on this point. The mini- 
mum, naturally, should not be below that determined by Chitten- 
den, and perhaps somewhat above this will be found to be best, 
that is, about 70 gm. of protein daily for an average-sized indi- 
vidual. This should be given largely as eggs and egg dishes, 
milk and milk dishes, and cheeses, together with what is derived 
from the vegetable part of the diet. The purin foods should be 
allowed as suggested above. It has been suggested that, as uric 
acid retention occurs more at night, the purin food is best 
given in the morning. Many cases may be allowed meat once 
a day and fish once a day, preferably not at the same meal. 
The wdiite varieties of fish seem to be best accordino: to clinical 
experiences. Fresh beef or mutton or poultry are, as a rule, 
digested better, and twice cooked and salt meats as well as salt 
fish are usually forbidden, but there may be exceptions to this. 

The tolerance for fats varies. As a rule, a certain amount of 



616 DIET IN DISEASE. 

butter, cream, olive oil, and crisp bacon may be allowed. If 
the fats cause indijj^estion the amounts should be lessened. 

Sugars and sweets, as a rule, do not agree. Individual experi- 
ence is the best guide ; as a rule the minimum should be allowed. 
Honey or stewed fruits (compotes) are generally included in 
German dietaries. 

Starchy foods, as l)readstuffs, cereals, and potatoes, may be 
allowed according to tlie jmtient's ability to digest them without 
fermentation and flatulence. This is always an individual ques- 
tion and often a difficult one to decide. Many gouty patients 
are obese, and the starches in such should be reduced to a mini- 
mum. Oatmeal is not advisable on account of the high purin 
content. Vegetables may be given if well digested. It should 
be remembered that peas, beans, lentils, mushrooms, spinach, and 
])eppers all contain considerable purin nitrogen. These should be 
allowed in moderation, sparingly, or not at all, according to the exi- 
gencies of the cases. Carrots, cauliflower, artichokes, salsify, tur- 
nips, onions, greens, cabbage, beets, etc., may be allowed. When 
sugar disagrees, carrots a.nd beets may be restricted. Asparagus, 
rhubarb, tomatoes, and sorrel are questionable and certainly do 
not agree with some patients, possibly on account of acids. 

As in all other things pertaining to the gouty diet, there is a 
great diversity of o])inion concerning fruit. It depends largely 
on tlie individual patient. Grapes and oranges are, as a rule, 
best borne. Baked apples and stewed fruit come next. Some 
advise strawberries on account of the potassium contained, others 
forl)id them. In some patients they cause considerable disturb- 
ance. If one wishes to try potassium-containing fruits, a list 
will b(^ found under the heading of Salts. 

\{' the ])ati('nt shows signs of any gouty disturbance a milk 
diet for a few days will be found of great service. 

Gare should be taken not to starve the ])atient. A sufficient 
amount of wcll-prej^ared food should be taken each day. There 
is no dis(\'ise concerning which there is as much difference of 
opinion concerniugdiet, and the attenqits to follow the directions 
of the older writers is apt to lead to starving the patient a!id 
unnecessary restriction. 

Saline Springs. — Visits to mineral springs and the taking 
of miueral waters at home often exert a ha})py influence over 
some cases of gout. The nature of the water seems to l)e of 
secondary imjiortance, for it seems to be the water, and not the 
salts contained in it, that is helpful. The relation of the vari- 
ous salts to gout is not thoroughly understood. 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 617 

The following points^ regarding the choiee of a spring, are 
given by various authors : 

For acute and periodic attacks of gout : Assmannshausen, 
Ems, Xeuenahr, Royat, or Vichy. 

For the plethoric and robust, where there is a strong heredi- 
tary predisposition or where there is stomach, intestinal, liver, 
or kidney disease : Carlsbad or Marienbad. 

For chronic and debilitated cases : Kissingen, Homburg, 
Baden-Baden, Bourbonne-les-Bains, Harrogate, or Wiesbaden. 

For long-continued domestic use in mild cases : Gieshiibel, 
Salvatorquelle, or Vals. 

Among the American springs may be mentioned : Hot 
Springs, Va. ; Hot Springs, Ark. ; Hot Springs, N. C. ; Mt. 
Clemens, Mich. ; Las Vegas, N. M. ; Sweet Springs, Pa. ; 
Capon Springs, W. Va. ; Glenwood Springs, Colo. ; Coronado 
Springs, Colo. ; Saratoga Springs, N. Y. ; AYliite Sulphur 
Springs, W. Va. ; Bedford, Va. 

Osier recommends the following : American — Saratoga, Bed- 
ford, and White Sulphur. Englifili — Buxton and Bath. French 
— Aix-les-bains and Contrexeville. German — Carlsbad, Wild- 
bad, and Homburg. 

Alcohol and Gout. — There is probably but little doubt 
as to the injurious effect of alcohol in gouty subjects, and it 
serves not only as a predisposing factor, but as an exciting 
cause. If the patient has never used alcohol or used it but 
sparingly, and if it is not needed especially as a stimulant, it 
should be excluded entirely from the diet. On the other hand, 
if the patient has been habituated to the use or abuse of alcohol, 
its withdrawal is often followed by serious consequences. This 
is most true in those who are weak, whose circulation is poor, 
or whose stomach demands an alcoholic stimulant before it be- 
gins work. Sydenham said : ^' The old saw is that if you drink 
wine you will have the gout, if you do not, the gout will have 
you" — in other words, ^' while it may be good for the patient, 
it is bad for the disease." 

Alcohol is contraindicated in acute gout except in the weak 
and aged. In subacute gout and in chronic gout alcohol should 
be avoided wherever possible. When its use is necessarv, the 
best form of alcohol for these patients is undoubtedly well- 
matured pure whisky sufficiently diluted with water. The daily 
allowance should be placed as low as possible — two ounces or 
double that quantity in some cases should ordinarily suffice. 
Good old brandy or gin may be substituted for the sake of 
variety. Wines and malt liquors are best avoided, but curious 



618 DIET IN DISEASE. 

idiosyncrasies in regard to tliem exist The choice of a wine 
for the gouty is a matter of personal taste and experience. All 
very sweet or acid \yincs are injurious. Ewart gives the fol- 
lowing rules for choosing wines, and says that the ])est are those 
with a ^'moderate percentage of alcoiiol and of ether; least pos- 
sible degree of acidity ; freedom from unfermented sugar, as far 
as that is consistent with a natural unadulterated condition ; 
freedom from tannin ; genuineness as to vintage, or at least to 
derivation ; mixed wines do the most harm ; and lastly, matured 

Good claret or a dry Moselle is ])crhaps the best, while cham- 
pagne is perhaps the most injurious, wine for the gouty. Tliis 
last, ho\yever, as most every variety of wine, has some enthu- 
siastic advocates. 

Tea and coffee may be allo\yed, but it is desirable that they 
be given unsweetened and not too strong. If, however, sweet- 
ening is thought advisable, as it usually is, tablets of saccharin 
may be used in place of sugar. 

The Special diseases of the gouty requiring particular 
attention are the following : 

Gouty Glycosuria and Diabetes. — While a restricted diet is 
not desirable in these cases, large quantities of meat and heavy 
l)reads are generally productive of more harm than good. Very 
often, if the gouty condition receives proper attention, the gly- 
(;osuria will be lessened or may even disappear entirely. A 
motlerate (piantity of meat and fish, with well-toasted bread, 
brown bread, pulled l)read, rice, macaroni, and the like, in mod- 
er;ition are to l)e allowed, together with milk, cream, and i'atty 
Ibods. If symptoms are present, a milk diet for a short })erio(l 
will usually be found beneiicial. It is oiten well in these cases, 
even when the symptoms are not ui'gent, to give an occasional 
diet of" milk. 

(jouty Albuminuria. — In this condition the most suitabU- 
<li('t is one containing but a moderate (piantity of meat of the 
least irritating character, such as the white meat of chicken, 
steak, chops and roasts. 'i1ie meat should l)e lean. The white 
meat of boiled fish of the lighter yarictic^s and the more easily 
(h'gcstible vegetable- may al>o be ])ermitted. Whenever the 
amount of albumin in the urine is very large, or when there are 
symptoms of nephi"itis, a milk diet may be giyen ibr a few days 
or a week at a tim<'. 

Acid Gouty Dyspepsia. — Hiis is rme of the most serious and 
mo^t troublesome of the gouty affections. Many cases rc(|uire a 
milk diet, and it may be necessary to jx'ptonize the milk par- 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY E ACTOR. 610 

tially or completely. Peptos^enic milk powder or one of the infant 
foods may also be used. Malted milk, albuminized foods, or the 
malted foods may be utilized. 

In the less severe cases, lean meat and fish may be allowed 
in small quantities. Well-prepared vegetables may be given 
sparingly, while starches and fats are usually best avoided. 
The management of these cases is essentially the same as if 
gout were not present. 

Gouty Obesity. — The management here is similar to that in 
other conditions. Ebst^in regards obesity in the gouty as an 
unfavorable symptom, and recommends meat and fat and re- 
duces the carbohydrate food to the smallest ])ossible amount. 
His theory is that the fets protect the metabolism of the pro- 
teins to a smaller degree than do the starches and sugars. 
Sugar should be reduced, and only as little liquid as it is pos- 
sible to get along with should be allowed. Some authors recom- 
mend alcohol in small quantities. Duckworth gives a small 
amount of red Bordeaux wine mixed with a little water. 
Open-air life — horseback riding or other outdoor exercise — is 
advisable. An occasional visit to Marienbad, Carlsbad, or a 
similar resort is often beneficial. 

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (ARTHRITIS DEFORMANS). 

In this disease the diagnosis should be carefully made, as it 
is important that the patient receive a supporting diet, and not 
the restricted diet of the rheumatic and m)utv. 

Diet apparently plays no part in the etiology of the disease.. 
As in any chronic disease interfering with active exercise the di- 
gestion is apt to be below normal, and care must be taken that 
the food be digestible and taken in sufficiently small quantities. 
Heavy foods and indigestible articles should be avoided, as the 
patient must needs lead a sedentary life ; as a result of the latter 
constipation is apt to exist, and must be corrected. 

Garrod recommends a considerable quantity of meat to be 
taken in a well-mixed diet. Alcohol has a])})arently no in- 
fluence on the disease, and either spirituc^is or malt liquors 
may be used, if desirable, to support the patient's strength. 
The chief dietetic indication is the avoidance of anything that 
will cause indio^estion. 

OBESITY. 

Obesity is one of the conditions for which the phvsician is 
frequently asked to prescribe a diet cure. He should, therefore, 
be thoroughly informed concerning its causation, its mana2:e-

nient, and the reasons for and against redncing any given 
case. 

Tliere is probably no condition that has been more widely 
diseus.-ed by laymen of both ancient and modern times than 
obesity, for no disease is more thoroughly associated in the lay 
mind with its proper causes and its relations to diet than this 
"oily droj)sy/' as Byron calls it. Among the better known 
examples that have been mentioned in fiction are Silenus and 
his son Bacchus, as well as the more modern Fal staff. Many 
historic cliaracters were hampered by obesity. Epaminondas, 
the Greek senator, the Minstrel of Megara, with a three-yard 
girdle, and Eglon, king of Moab, are familiar examples. 
Chesterfield said : " Obesity and stupidity are such constant 
companions that they are considered synonymous." There 
have, however, been numerous exam])les of men of extraordi- 
nary mental ability and even activity who were obese, but w^e 
are all inclined to remember the fat boy in Dickens' '^ Pickwick 
Papers," who did nothing but eat and sleep. 

The accumulation of fat is associated with increasing years, 
but it is by no means confined to either old or middle ag(>, as is 
exemplified in the fat children familiar to all ; extreme obesity 
may be a })lague even of infants. Chambers is said to have re- 
})orted a case that he saw on exhibition at Manchester — a babe 
that weighed 5'0 pounds at six months. Numerous cases are 
on record where l)abes of tliis age weighed as much as forty 
])ounds. 

k'rom Hi])pocrates' time down to the present day direction^ 
have been given for the cure of this troublesome condition. 
Sliak(speare gave the essentials of the treatment and stated the 
dangers of obesity when he wrote : 

" Make less thy body hence, and more tliy e-niee. 
Leave ji-onnandizinii^ ; know the ^n-ave (h»th ^ape 
l'\)r tJiee thrice wider llian for other men." 

Willi Justus von Liebig's work came a better understanding 
of the formation of fat in the body, and while there are still 
very diverse opinions on the subject, the condition is, in the 
mnin, f'nirlv well understood. In 1 SoO Chambers warned 
again-t fit, bread, and potatoes. In 18f)'^> Mr. Louis Banting, 
an Kriglislirnan, ])iiblislic(l a letter giving an account of a 
metluxl of diet that he had employed on liimself with great 
l)enefit. Tlii- nietliod was that of Harvey, who was Banting^s 
physician. Harvty's name was withheld at the time, and as a 
result the name of ]^>anlinL'' has become associated with reduc- 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 621 

tioii cures and obesity. Ebsteiii published his work iu 1882, 
aud there have beeu numerous authors and physicians who have 
formuhited methods for, or made suggestions concerning, the 
treatment of obesity. Oertel was the first to point out that 
there was a close relation between obesity and weak heart, and 
he made abundant contributions to the literature on the cor- 
rect management of these diseases. 

The causes of obesity are so well know^n as to requn^e 
only passing mention. About 50 per cent, owe their primary 
origin to hereditary causes. AYomen are more frequently 
affected than men. With the advance of years, in some there 
is a tendency to accumulate fat. Overeating and over-drinking 
have been named as causative factors, especially when combined 
with a quiet, sedentary life. 

The fats and the carbohydrates are the principal elements in 
the diet that are apt to be converted into fat ; but proteins also, 
if the supply exceeds the demand and assimilation is active, 
wdll be converted into body-fat and stored up in the subcutane- 
ous tissues. The liver and the heart are also converted into 
storehouses for fat, and later there may be a fatty degeneration 
of both organs, as well as of the coats of the arteries. 

The dangers accompanying the excessive accumulation of fat 
are manifold, and include a large number of diseases that may 
be influenced by it either directly or indirectly. These will be 
discussed when the indications for reducing the weight of pa- 
tients are considered. Weak heart, anemia, gout, and diabetes 
are among the most frequent diseases associated with obesity. 

Treatment. — It is necessary, in attempting to treat this 
condition to distinguish between the cases that are plethoric and 
those that are anemic. One should, moreover, consider each 
case carefully, before reduction is decided upon. The condition 
of the blood, of the heart, and of the liver, and the rate of 
increase in the patient\s weight, should all be considered. 

The general appearance of the patient — whether the sym- 
metry of the body is preserved or whether it is distorted by 
fat-deposits — is also to be studied. More important still is the 
condition of the functions of the body and the state of the 
nervous system. Of especial value is it to learn the amount 
of disturbance of respiration and of circulation. 

The age of the patient is a factor of paramount importance. 
In persons under twenty reduction cures should not, as a rule, 
be used, but the diet should be so arranged that there will be 
no increase in the amount of fat deposited. When the weight 
is to be reduced, it should be done very gradually, and when 



622 DIET IN DISEASE. 

from fiv'G to fifteen pounds have been lost, a season of rest 
should follow. The period of restricted diet should not exceed 
four or five weeks. 

The reduction of patients from twenty to fifty years or older 
may be undertaken if other circumstances warrant it ; this will 
be considered later. 

During and even a little preceding the period of senescence 
reduction should not be permitted. The pliysical condition of 
the patient, rather than the number of years, should be the 
guide, for some persons grow old earlier than do others. The 
condition of the arteries is a good guide to senility, based on 
the dictum that a man is as old as his arteries. In persons in 
the decline of life reduction generally hastens very materially 
the breaking-down of the bodily forces. 

The following suggestions concerning the various grades of 
the disease and tlieir fitness for reduction cures will be found 
useful : 

Advanced cases — and tliey may be judged from their gen- 
eral appearance and condition of health — are, as a rule, fit 
subjects for reduction. 

In those who have been fat all their life or who have been 
fat for several decades, and who are approacliing old age, a 
reduction cure should not be undertaken. 

Average cases, w^here the weight is from thirty to fifty 
pounds above the average f)r their age, sex, and condition 
in life, should not be reiluced if they are aged. If the extra 
weight is well borne, they do not need it, and the diet should 
be so arranged as to prevent any further increase. If there is 
any reason to fear disease, they should be reduced. If the 
})atient takes a great deal of exercise, uses any (juantity of 
ak'ohol, or is given to excesses in eating, or, in fact, anything, 
he slioukl be reduced, for the chances are that he will accumu- 
late fat as time goes on or will become the subject of disease 
which his obesity will aggravate. Rapid reduction in these 
cases is bad as a rule, and it should be slow and syst(Mnatic. 

Slight degrees of obesity, where the body weight is from ten 
to thirty ])ounds over the averjigc, do not need re<lu('tion, but 
only a careful regulation of the diet and mode of living, so as 
to prevent any further deposits of fit. 

Tlie question of reducing some of these patients nnist be 
considered, for while they unfiuestiona])ly do perfectly well on 
a limitation of their increase in weight, still the question of 
personal apjx'arance is an all-important fac^tor with many 
women. It is more often the case with tliose sliirhtlv above 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY EACTOR. 623 

the average tlian for those that are very obese, as the latter 
have beeome aeeiistoined to their fat and are usually resigned 
to it. If these patients are not reduced the necessary few 
])ounds, they will go to one ])hysician after another until they 
find some one who will — generally a (juack who may do more 
harm than good by his methods and advice. When the per- 
sonal a})pearance can be used as an argument fijr the regulation 
of the diet and the manner of living, the physician has a hold 
upon the ])atient that he can scarcely get by any other means, 
and he may often prevent an accumulation of a troublesome 
amount of fat in after years by the careful instruction of the 
patient in the art of living as it must be jjractised by that par- 
ticular individual. As Ebstein puts it, " Corpulence can only 
be permanently cured by a permanent change of life and diet, 
regulated by physiologic principles. ^^ 

There are certain objections that may be raised to reduction 
in women. The loss of the abdominal fat may lead to (,'onsti- 
pation, to hernia, to gastroptosis, to dislocation of the kidney, 
and even of the uterus. Von Noorden states that these patients 
may develop gall-stone colic, \yhich probably results from the 
pressure of the clothing on the liver, causing interference with 
the flow of bile, and consequently favors the formation of gall- 
stones. So long as the patients are obese the pressure exerted 
by the clothing is usually trifling and does not fall directly on 
the liver. These objections to reduction cures in women iwo. 
more marked in mild than in the more advanced cases. 

A much discussed point is whether it is possible to reduce 
any special part of the body more rapidly than the remaining 
jiarts. This is a method often sought by women who have 
borne several children and who have large deposits of fat in the 
abdominal walls, causing an unsightly prominence of the abdo- 
men. If the fat is reduced slowly, every part of the body, 
including usually the abdomen as well, will be reduced simul- 
taneously. If it is reduced rapidly, it seems to be removed 
principally from certain })arts of the body, as the neck, breasts, 
arms, and calves of the legs. Certain advocates of massage 
claim that the massage of the parts will cause a more rapid re- 
duction. Von Noorden had one arm of an obese patient mas- 
saged for six weeks. At the end of that time the arm that had 
been massaged had increased one and one-half centimeters in 
circumference, whereas the arm that had not been massaged 
remained the same. 

Massage of the abdomen during a reduction cure may exert 
a beneficial effect by relieving the constipation^ which is apt to 



624 DIET IN DISEASE. 

be troublesome. Exercise is still more potent, particularly for 
reducing the abdomen. This is accomplished by standing erect 
and then l)ending forward in an eifort to touch the toes with 
the tips of the fingers. Too much should not be expected from 
this, even when persisted in faithfully. 

When disease exists together with obesity, a reduction cure 
is often indicated, and it is frequently the most important part 
of the treatment, although it is one that is too often overlooked. 
In such cases a reduction of the amount of fat may not only 
render the patient more comfortable, but in many cases may be 
the direct means of ])rolonging the patient's life and period of 
usefulness. In these cases reduction is not to be regarded as a 
weakening process, the reverse being true — tlie patients usually 
grow stronger as their weights grow less. It must be borne in 
mind, however, that each case is to be studied carefully and 
treated individually, for no general rule can be made to ai)ply 
to every case that comes under tlie physician's care. This ap- 
plies not only as to the question of reduction, Init also to the 
manner in which this is to be accomplished. 

Diseases Combined with Obesity. — Diseases of the 
Circulatory System. — To Oertel belongs the credit of pointing 
out the great benefits to be derived from a rational method of 
treating affections of the heart when combined with obesity. 
Benefit follows not only in patients with valvular lesions, but 
in those suffering from other diseases as well. Among these 
conditions may be mentioned arteriosclerosis, myocarditis, de- 
generation of the heart muscle, the so-called fatty heart, aneu- 
rysm of the aorta, and those diseases of the chest or respiratory 
organs that interfere with tlie circulation. 

The reduction of the body weight in these cases, it should be 
understood, does not alter the character of the lesion itself, but 
it lessens greatly the work of the heai-t, and permits of more 
complete oxidation of the blood. It is of (\<])eclal value in 
those cases where the existence of the lesion itself is not incom- 
patible with the life of the ])atl('nt so long as he Is kept in 
rcasonablv good condition. li' nHliictlon is undertaken before 
there is anv fiiilurc of compensation, the results are, as a rule, 
very gratifying. If compensation is on the verge of rupture, 
or If It has actually begun, it may often ]>e checked to a remark- 
able degree ;uid sometimes averted altogether. Reduction may 
work wonders even in what at first seem to be very severe 
crises. In the hopeless cases it is useless to attempt it. One 
should not, however, be too hasty in deciding that a case is 
hopeless, for even very serious cases may be relieved. 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A riUMARY E ACTOR. 625 



The suiroestions for treatment made hv Oertel are most 
useful, and \\\\\ be g:iven further on. For ])atients where com- 
pensation is perfect, but whose bodies are obese to a degree that 
seems to the ])hysician to indicate danger, a ra})id reduction 
cure may be instituted. Where there is b(>ginning failure of 
compensation, Groedel, of Nauheim, von Noorden, and others 
recommend large doses of digitalis, to be followed by a some- 
what rapid reduction. This may be efJected })y any method, 
but, according to the authors just named, those methods involv^- 
ing the use of salines should be avoided. The amount of fluid, 
as well as the food, must be limited. The reduction is best 
undertaken at a sanitarium. For the first few weeks four or 
five pounds a week may be removed, and after that about that 
many a month. 

The worst cases are those in which edema occurs together 
with obesity. In these cases, as a rule, not nmch is to be 
hoped for, and a reduction cure in the ordinary sense of the 
word should not be undertaken. These patients do not gen- 
erally have any great desire for food, and hence the amount of 
liquid consumed should be the point of especial consideration. 
The heart should be stimulated, and later, if possible, exercises 
should be begun. Digitalis is, of course, of the greatest use in 
these cases. The food need not, as a rule, be limited, unless, 
as improvement sets in, fat be deposited ; this is not, however, 
apt to be the case. 

Diseases of the Respiratory System. — These are to be con- 
sidered principally in their relation to the circulation, and what 
has been said of heart diseases applies with equal truth to these. 
The most frequent res])iratory disturbances are adherent pleurisy 
and emphysema. A kyphosis, by compressing the chest space, 
may also prove troublesome. A reduction of the body weight 
often brings about a marked improvement in these cases. 

Bronchitis in fat, and especially in elderly, patients is apt to 
be very troublesome. In many patients a very resistant bron- 
chitis, which does not yield either to drugs or to climatic treat- 
ment, occurs every winter. In these cases a reduction of the 
body weight, by allowing the patient to breathe deeply and 
with ease, will often be of more assistance in effecting a cure 
than all other measures combined. 

Chronic and interstitial nephritis is also a disease in which 
the patient must either be reduced or at least tlie amount of 
food and drink be so limited as to prevent any further increase 
in weight. (See the section on Diseases of the Kidney.) 

40 



626 DIET IN DISEASE. 

In many diseases that affect the legs, such as hemiplegias, 
cord disease, and neuritis, as well as the many surgical dis- 
orders affecting the feet or legs, a reduction in the body weight 
will often permit the patient to get about with considerable 
ease, whereiis if he is allowed to accumulate fat he may ulti- 
mately become practically helpless. The same may be said of 
chronic articular rheumatism, of arthritis deformans, or of 
osteo-arthritis affecting the lower extremities. 

Obesity and gout form a combination tliat presents unusual 
difficulties in the selection of a proper diet. If the patients 
subsist on an anti-gout diet, they gain in weight, and if they 
adhere to a diet that aims to avoid gain in weight, they are apt 
to contract gout. (The reader is referred to the section on 
Gout for further information on this point.) One must choose 
between two evils and arrange the diet accordingly. As a rule, 
a diet of lean meat with an abundance of fresh fruit and green 
vegetables is, in the average case, the best. 

There are many nervous diseases not included among those 
that render locomotion difficult that are frequently either bene- 
fited or entirely cured by a reduction in body weight if the 
patient has been nmch above the average. Most important of 
these are the various neuralgias, which are often the Ijane of fat 
persons. Sciatica and occipital, supra-orbital, and left-sided 
brachial neuralgia are among those nervous disorders that, 
according to von Xoorden, may be most frequently relieved. 

This same observer has pointed out another condition in 
which gain in weight should be limited — one tliat is frequently 
overlooked ])y the average practitioner. This is in obesity 
following the cures for pulmonary tuberculosis. These 
])atients fre([uently take on large (piantities of fat, and in some 
cases the very fatness they strive to ac(juire may be the means 
of their undoing, interfering, as it may, with exercise and with 
l)i'eathing. Fortunately this class of cases is not large. If 
thev continue to gain in weight after the pulmonary disorder 
has been (!ured, or if the weight becomes a source of danger to 
thctn, the patient's diet should be so arranged as to limit the 
amount of i'at (l('})osited. 

In all cases the })ati('nt nnist be told that it is only by ]ier- 
scverance that any ])ermanent good can be eifccted. Little is 
to be gained bv a few weeks' dieting oi* by a sojourn for a few 
weeks at a watering-place if the diet is to be unrestricted there- 
after. Many ])atients who will not persevere in the diet while 
at home do well at a resort, or, better still, at a sanitarium, 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A rPJMARY EACTOR. 627 

Avliere, in addition to bciiiii^ reduced in weight, they learn the 
art of living as well. Jn others it is better to prescribe short 
courses at various intervals. These may be of four or five 
weeks' duration, and after the ])atient has lost from live to fif- 
teen ])()unds, he may be allowed some freedom in the interval. 

Kxercise is of the greatest im])ortance, and should be carried 
out according to the suggestions made by Oertel. Exercise 
in ihi}, open air, such as walking either on level ground or uphill, 
as suggested by Oertel, is to be preferred to indoor exercise and 
gymnasium training. In certain towns in (Jermany, Austria, 
and Switzerland, as well as in this country, what are known as 
'^ terrain cures 'Miavc been established; in these the paths are 
marked according to distance and as to the grade. The })atient 
is carefully instru.cted by the physician as to how far he is to 
walk and on what grades. Similar walks may be planned by a 
physician anywhere if the country is of such a nature as to 
permit it. The amount of exercise should be carefully regulated, 
and the distance to be walked, rather than the time that is to 
be spent in walking, clearly outlined. 

In cases with weak hearts prognosis is of es])ecial importance. 
According to Oertel, if there is hydremia or circulatory dis- 
turbance, the ])rognosis will be governed by the diflTerencc in 
the quantity of fluid taken and the amount of urine excreted. 
For two days the patient should take as much fluid as he has 
been accustomed to, and the amount, as well as the quantity, of 
urine excreted, noted. For two days more the amount of fluid 
should be reduced to from 700 to 1000 c.c, and the urine 
should again be measured. If with the reduced amount of 
fluid the urine is equal in quantity to, or larger tlian, the amount 
of liquid ingested, it is a sign that the heart power is not ex- 
cessively weak and that the kidneys are in fiir condition, and 
a favorable prognosis may be given, providing the ])ro])er regi- 
men be followed out. If the amount of urine excreted is less 
than the quantity of water ingested, the ])rognosis is unfavor- 
able. If the urine is only slightly less, this may be regarded 
as an actual increase, as from 18 to 20 per cent, of that taken, 
as well as the amount in the solid food, is given off with res- 
piration, perspiration, etc. If there is arteriosclerosis, fever, 
or diabetes, the ])rognosis is unfavorable. 

Prophylaxis of Obesity. — In all persons with a heredi- 
tary tendency to obesity, and in all obese persons who have 
become thin, pro])hylactic measures should be undertaken. These 
consist in an avoidance of fat-forming foods, and, if necessary, 



628 DIET IS DISEASE. 

in a careful regulation of the diet and of the amount of exer- 
cise. A.s the individual grows older and the danger of obesity 
becomes more pronounced, the diet should always be regulated 
and the proper amount of exercise insisted upon. 

Diet Cures. — The Banting Method. — This method, which 
was mentioned previously, was used by Mr. Banting, who re- 
duced his weight in one year from 202 to 156 pounds — a 
loss of 46 pounds. This method was used largely in England. 
It is entirely too severe for the average patient and must be 
modified. For those with weak digestion it is usually entirely 
unsuited. Following its use renal colic or gall-stones with 
colic are apt to occur. Constipation may be present, and the 
entire system may become so derauged as to render the patient 
liable to disease. 

Banting Diet for Obesity ( Yeo). — ^' Breakfast at 9 A. M. 
consisted of 5 to 6 ounces of animal food-meat or boiled fish 
(except pork or veal) ; a little biscuit or 1 ounce of dry roast — 
6 to 7 ounces of solids in all. A large cup of tea or coffee 
(without milk or sugar) — 9 ounces of liquid. 

" Dinner, 2 p. M. : Fish or meat (avoiding salmon, eels, her- 
ring, pork, and veal), 5 to 6 ounces ; any kind of poultry or 
game. Any vegetables except potato, parsnips, beet-root, 
turnips, or carrot. Dry roast, 1 ounce. Cooked fruit, un- 
sweetened. Good claret, sherry, or Madeira, 10 ounces. Total 
of solids, 10 to 12 ounces. 

^' Tea, 6 p. m. : Cooked fruit, 2 to 3 ounces ; a rusk or two — 
2 to 4 ounces of solids ; 9 ounces of tea, without milk or sugar. 

" Supper, 9 p. m. : Meat or fish, as at dinner, 3 to 4 ounces. 
Claret or sherry and water, 7 ounces. 

'' This allowed only from 21 to 27 ounces of solids per diem, 
of which 13 to 16 ounces consisted of animal food and only 2 
ounces of bread ; the rest consisted of fruit and fresh vege- 
tables. There was the strictest possible exclusion of starches 
and sugar. 

" The total fluid was limited to 35 ounces." 

Oertel's Method. — Oertel makes the following suggestions 
as to the treatment of the various classes of obesity, always 
considering whether the patient is j)lethoric or anemic : 

^^ (r/,) Where there is an abnormally increased amount of fat 
in plethoric patients with unimpaired or only beginning changes 
in the heart action the diet sliould aim at — 

'^n) An increased supply of })rotein. 

'' (2) A decrease in the fat-j)roducing su])stances. 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY FACTOR. 629 

" (3) Little or no diminution in the supply of liquids below 
the physiologic amount (1500 c.c. — 3 pints). 

" (6) Where there is obesity in anemic patients, viz., serous 
plethora, the diet should aim at — 

^'(1) An increase in the quantity of proteins. 

" (2) A diminution in the amount of fat-forming substances, 
and eventually — 

'^(3) A decrease in the amount of fluid. 

"(c) Where there is obesity in adults with hydremic symp- 
toms, in whom not only the amount of protein, but also the 
abnormally increased amount of fat is slowly wasting away, 
they require — 

" (1) An increase in the amount of protein taken. 

" (2) A sufficient amount of fet and carbohydrates or even 
an increase of same to prevent the falling off of fat. 

" (3) A diminution in the amount of fluid taken. ^^ 

Oertel lays particular stress on the fact that dietetic rules 
should be based upon changes in the heart, and consequently of 
the circulation. Both the quality and the quantity of food and 
drink should be considered. If the circulation is disturbed, 
small excesses, either in food or in drink, will give rise to 
distress. The most noticeable symptoms are a feeling of op- 
pression, palpitation of the heart, and difficulty in breathing. 
In pronounced cases of disturbances of the circulation, if too 
hearty a meal has been indulged in, death may follow slight 
exertion. In these cases death is due to paralysis of the heart. 
The effect of the meals on the circulation must be observed 
carefully, the amount of disturbance following a meal Avill 
determine the size and the number of meals that must be taken. 

The aim of the treatment is to furnish food and exercise in 
such amounts that the body fat may be burnt up and tluis the 
needed reduction of weight take place, while at the same time 
the body and heart are strengthened. This can be done only 
by a careful study of each case. In a word, the physician 
must discriminate between those cases in which the respiratory 
and circulatory a])paratus have not been disturbed, and where 
the muscular apparatus is in such condition tliat a considerable 
amount of bodily exercise may still be taken, and those cases 
in which the blood is poor, where advanced venous stasis 
reduces the absorption of oxygen in the lungs to a minimum, 
and where slight muscular exertion exhausts the oxygen, inter- 
feres with respiration, and gives rise to dyspneic symptoms. 
In the first class a liberal amount of fat and carbohydrates may 



630 DIET IN DISEASE. 

be allowed — that is, as large a quantity as the patient can dis- 
pose of in his body by exercise without defeating the objects 
of the treatment. In the second class the fats and carbo- 
hydrates and the quantity of fluid taken must be reduced to a 
mininnnn. 

The foods given must be such as w^ill supply the proper 
amount of nourishment without forming fat. The following 
are ec^uivalent in heat and force production, or, in other words, 
they are said to have the same caloric value : 100 grams of fat, 
211 grams of protein, 232 grams of starch, 234 grams of cane- 
sugar, 256 grams of grape-sugar (240 grams as a sugar 
average). To make this more clear it must be remembered 
that a body stores up fat if more than 118 grams of protein 
and 259 grams of fat, with a caloric value of 2894, are taken ; 
but 110 grams of protein and 600 grams of starch, with a 
caloric value of 2944, may be given without producing fat. 
With a mixed diet the limit lies near 118 grams of ])rotein, 
100 grams of fat, and 368 grams of starch, a total of 586 
grams, or of 2923 calories. The simplest way to reduce the 
fat-forming elements is to diminish the fat and alloAv a certain 
amount of carbohydrates. The diet must be regulated accord- 
ing to the individual case — this is a point that can not be too 
strongly insisted upon. Oertel gives the following figures, 
based on numerous calculations : 



Protein Fat 

Grums. Grams. 



Carbo- 
hydrates Calories. 



Minimum , . . 156 25 75 1180 

Maxinuim 170 45 120 1608 

Tlie amount of material burnt in the body may reach from 
2500 to 3500 calories, and tlie difference between that su])plied 
by the food and the total amount used is taken from the fat 
stored u]) in the })ody, and the patient loses weight accordingly. 

Oertel lays ])articular stress on limiting the amount of fluid 
taken. Pie regards 1500 cc. as the ])hysiologic limit, and 
allows more than this — from 1800 to 2000 c.c. — only in very 
tall ])atients or when there is fever. In still other cases he 
reduces the amouut to from 750 to 1200 c.c. 

The solid food is to be taken in severnl small meals, and the 
li(juids are to be taken only in the intervals between meals. 
Sou])S are not ])ermitted. Five or six meals are given a day, 
their fre(|uency obviating the necessity for eating very large 
meals. 



DISEASES IX WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY EACTOR. 631 

If the patient is anemic, the l)reakfast sliould he of sutlicient 
size, but should not inehide either tea or eoil'ee. 

Oertel regards exercise as of as much importance as diet. 
In the average cas(^ he advises from four to live hours' outdoor 
exercise daily, taken in the morning and afternoon. If the 
patient can not take that much — and he rarely can at first — he 
is given exercises of increasing length and severity until the 
required amount is reached. The increase should be made 
gradually, and should de})end entirely on the patient's condition. 
He should be told the distance he is to walk, and not the time 
in which he is to do it, for if the latter is done, a lazy patient 
may do much less than is necessary, whereas the energetic or 
ambitious patient may overexert himself. 

Oertel insists on the exercise being taken in the open air and 
on the careful regulation of the amount by the physician. 
Where it is possible, as it is at some of the Continental resorts, 
the paths should be of four different grades. These are as 
follows : 

First the incline from to 5 degrees 

Second the incline from o to 10 degrees 

Third the incline from 10 to 15 degrees 

Fourth the incline from 15 to 20 degrees 

A pedometer may be used to measure the amount of walking 
done, and fm'nishes a convenient means of ])rcscribing walking 
exercises. Care should be taken to use only a reliable instru- 
ment, for some are very inaccurate. The amount of exercise is 
regulated according to the state of the patient's heart, his gen- 
eral strength and condition, and also as to whether he is })leth- 
oric or anemic. Any complications that exist must also be 
taken into account. 

If the patient is plethoric and the heart is in good condition, 
he may be ordered to take w^alks of the first and second grades 
at the outset, the distance prescribed being about that which an 
ordinary individual would walk in from one and one-half to 
two hours. This amount should be divided uj) between the 
morning and afternoon, as circinnstanccs may warrant. The 
return course is not taken into account. The patient should be 
allowed to consume as nuich time as he requires in walking this 
distance. Care should be taken to avoid overexertion. Days 
of rest may be interspersed as the need for them arises. The 
distance may be lessened or increased, according to the case. 
The patient should use the paths of the fourth grade only when 



632 DIET IN DISEASE. 

the heart has become strong and when he is in good condition, 
and then only occasionally. 

The patient should be taught to breathe deeply and regularly. 
Ordinarily, if he gets out of breath easily, he may be allowed 
an inspiration and an expiration for each step. When using 
the paths of the second and third grades, the patient may from 
time to time, for short intervals, breathe in an interrupted 
(staccato) manner, taking one inspiration for two steps and then 
two expirations within the next two steps. This method is often 
of great value in securing perfect inspiration and expiration. 

If the patient is anemic or hydremic, or if the heart action is 
impaired, the exercises should be begun on level ground and 
gradually increased in severity. Several weeks or more, ac- 
cording to the case, should be allowed to elapse before the 
patient is permitted to try the third grade paths. 

In patients with sclerosis and atheroma exercises must be pre- 
scribed with extreme caution. If the sclerosis is not marked, 
the patient may derive the greatest benefit from the exercises, 
but the amount and the variety should be cautiously jirescribcd 
and their effect watched. If atheroma is present, the greatest 
care should be taken to guard against overexertion. In all 
these cases, however, exercises should not be entirely dispensed 
with, although the amount may be limited to the minimum. 

If there is involvement of the coronary arteries, whether or 
not stenocardic attacks have taken place, only the smallest 
amounts of exercise should ])e allowed, and these sliould be on 
level ground. It is only in rare cases that this amount should 
be dispensed with, for if the patient remains at rest and the 
fatty condition be allowed to ])rogress, the jxatient must inevi- 
tably become very weak. 

Exercise is contraindicated in myocarditis, pronounced albu- 
minuria, and^general edema. AVhen any of these are ])resent, 
rest and pro})er medication are to \h' advised. 

Diet After the Treatment. — The following is Oertel's general 
diet, which is to be modified to suit the individual case. 

" Mo/iiliif/ : A cup of coU'ee or tea witli milk (150 to 200 
c.c. — .") t() G ounces) and bread. To grams (2^ ounces). 

"Forenoon : In cases ])receding anemia and hydremia, one 
or two soft-l)oiled eggs or .*>0 to 40 grams (one to one and one- 
half ounces) of meat, cold or freshly broiled, 100 c.c. (o ounces) 
of wine, or in conditions of weakness oO c.c. (IJ ounces) port, 
and a small (piantity of bread. 

"Xoon: 100 c.c. soup; 150 to 200 grams (5 to 6 ounces) 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY EACTOR. 633 

meat of various kinds, boiled or broiled beef, veal, game, or 
fowl, not too fat; salad or easily digested vegetables at discre- 
tion ; likewise fish cooked without much grease ; 25 grams 
(about 1 ounce) bread or some farinaceous food — at most, 
100 grams (3 ounces) ; for dessert, fruit, 100 to 200 grams (3 
to G ounces), best fresh or preserved (especially after Nageli's 
method). For drink, one-sixth to one-fourth of a liter (G to 8 
ounces) of liglit wine or beer ; water. 

^^ Afternoon : Again, 150 to 200 c.c. (5 to G ounces) of coffee 
or tea, with about one-fourth of a liter of water (one-lialf ])int) 
and 25 to 50 grams (1 to 2 ounces) of bread if there is any 
desire for it. 

^^ Evening : Meat as at noon, or eggs, 25 grams (about 1 
ounce) of bread, and possibly a small amount of cheese, salad, 
or fruit. Beverage, w^ine, Avith or without water, or beer, best 
taken some time after the meal — up to 300 to 500 c.c. (J to 1 
pint). Delicacies, oysters, caviare, etc., by reason of their 
nourishing qualities, may be eaten between or before meals, but 
so that they do not too much augment the total quantity of food.'' 
(See Tables I. and II., pages 634 and 635.) 

Ebstein*s Dietary. — Ebstein's dietary consists in a diet low 
in carbohydrates, but containing considerable amounts of fat. 
According to Oertel, Zuntz has pointed out that Ebstein's theory 
arose from a misconception of a statement made by Voit. It 
is just the opposite of the view accepted by physiologists, and 
]\Iunk has proved experimentally (using rape oil containing 
erucic acid, which could afterward be recognized in the tissues) 
that fat may be absorbed from the intestine directly and 
deposited in the tissues without undergoing any essential 
change. The custom of giving fatty food is as old as Hip- 
pocrates, for he says, '' The food shall be fat in order to satiate 
quickly." 

Ebstein's diet-list forbids the use of all sugar and SAveets and 
potatoes in any form, and directs that the amount of bread 
ingested be reduced to six or seven ounces daily. Of the 
vegetables that are allowed, the following are the most import- 
ant : asparagus, spinach, cabbage, beans, peas, and other 
legumes. Meat of every description, especially fat meat, is 
permitted. From four to six ounces of fat are given daily. 

Three meals a day are allowed — a light breakfast and supj^er 
and a heavy midday dinner. Coffee or tea may be taken with 
the light meals, and, if desired, a glass or two of white or red 
wine with the dinner.

636 ' DIET IN DISEASE. 

Breakfast — in winter, 6.30 A. M. ; in summer, 7.30 A. m. : One 
large cup of black tea without milk or sugar ; two ounces of white 
or brown bread with plenty of butter. 

Dinner — about 2 p.m. : Soup (with bone-marrow occasion- 
ally), four to six ounces of meat, boiled or roasted, with fat 
gravy, especially fat meat, an abundance of vegetables, cabbage, 
and most of the legumes (peas and beans). Beets and carrots 
are almost entirely excluded, and potatoes are forbidden abso- 
lutely. After dinner a small quantity of fresh fruit and occa- 
sionally salad or stewed fruit without sugar. To this are added 
two or three glasses of light white wine. Soon after dinner 
another large cup of black tea without sugar or milk is allowed. 

Supper — between 7 and 8 p. m. : In winter regularly, and in 
summer occasionally, another large cup of tea without sugar or 
milk. One egg or a small portion of fat meat or both ; or ham 
with fat, sausage, smoked or fresh fish, two ounces of white 
brciid, with plenty of butter ; occasionally a bit of cheese and 
fresh fruit. 

The foregoing dietary was followed by a man of forty-four 
who had suffered from obesity since his twenty-fifth year. He 
lost twenty pounds in nine months, and improved in every way. 
This diet may be taken as an average diet suitable for a man 
with a sedentary occupation. 

Ebstein maintains that the diet should be such as will allow 
tlie patient to live comfortably witliout increasing his weight ; 
he also calls attention to the fact that such a diet must be fol- 
lowed for a lifetime. 

Schweninger Method. — This is practically the same as 
OerteFs method, with one exception — i. e., that the use of fluids 
with meals is absolutely ])rohibited, any fluid that is allowed 
being taken fully two hours after a meal. Schweninger's flime 
was greatly enhanced by the fact that he was Bismarck's j)}iysi- 
cian ; he used this metliod to keep down tliat famous states- 
man's weight. 

The following is an outline of the diet used : 

J)real:f((sf, 8 A. M. (to be preceded })y exercise and a ])ath an 
hour before) : ^Feat, i'<j:i!:^, or milk. After this a walk. 

LuDch, 10.:U) A. y\. : Meat or fish and a glass of white wine. 
To be followed by a walk. 

Dhnier^ 1 P. M. : Meat, vegetables, and fruit com])otc. 

Supper, 7 I'. M. : Meat and fruit com])6te or salad, and a 
ghiss of white wine. 

Bread is to be taken as sparlugly as possible. 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMA IIV E ACTOR. 637 

Schleicher Diet for Obesity. — BrcahfaHf, 7 A. ^r. : A mutton 
or veal cutlet or a portion of sole as large as the palm of the 
hand ; tlie same quantity of bread without butter. 

8 A. M. : A cup of tea with sugar. 

10. .'>0 A. M. : A sandwich of bread and meat-sausage. 
Xoon : Meat, eggs, green vegetables, cheese, an orange. 
Two glasses of white wine. (No soup ; no j)otatoes.) 
4 p. ]\r. : Tea with sugar. 
7 P. M. : A small quantity of bread and cheese. 

9 P. M. : Cold meat, (i'^^J:^, salad. Two glasses of wine and 
sometimes more. 

This diet, used by Schleicher, of Antwerp, is quite similar to 
tlie diet of Schweninger, except that the former does not insist 
on prohibiting fluids absolutely with the meals. 

Qermain S^e Method. — See, one of the leading French 
authorities on diet, maintains that the amount of fluid taken 
should be increased instead of diminished. He gives as his 
reason for this the fact that many corpulent persons suffer from 
gout or the so-called uric-acid diathesis, and that the water taken 
stimulates metabolism and aids in the elimination of waste- 
products. He advises tea or coffee, taken as hot as possible, in 
considerable quantities, especially at breakfast. He prohibits 
alcohol, except in certain cases, where a small glass of diluted 
white wine is allowed. 

Weir-Mitchell Method. — This method, which its originator 
claims is especially suitable in those cases where there is merely 
an overabundance of fat, and also in fat anemic women, is out- 
lined in MitchelFs book. Fat and Blood, as follows : " The 
person whose weight we decide to lessen is placed on skim-milk 
alone, with the usual precautions ; or at once we give skim- 
milk with the usual food, and in a week we put aside all other 
diet save milk, and all other fluids. When we find what quan- 
tity of milk will sustain the weight, we diminish the amount by 
degrees until the patient is losing half a pound of weight each 
day, or less or more, as seems to be well borne. Meanwhile, 
during the first week or two, rest in bed is enjoined, and later, 
for a varying period, rest in bed or on a lounge is insisted upon, 
while at the same time massage is used once or twice a day, and 
later in the case Swedish movements. At tlie same time the 
pulse and weight are observed with care, so that if there be too 
rapid a loss or any sign of feebleness, the diet may be increased. 
In many such cases I allow daily a moderate amount of beef, 
or chicken, or oyster soup, more as a relief to the unpleasant- 



638 DIET IN DISEASE. 

ness of a milk diet than for any otlier reason. AVhen the weight 
has been sufficiently lowered, we add to the diet beef, mutton, 
oysters, etc., and finally arrange a full diet-list, to include but a 
moderate amount of hydrocarbons. Meanwhile the milk 
remains as a large part of the food, and active Swedish move- 
ments are still kept up as a habit, the patient being directed 
by degrees to add the usual forms of exercise. If we attempt 
to make so speedy a change in weight while tlie patient is afoot, 
the loss is apt to be gravely felt ; but with the precautions here 
advised, it is interesting and pleasant to see how great a reduc- 
tion may be made in a reasonable time without annoyance, and 
with no obvious result except a gain in health and comfort." 

This method is naturally limited to the wealthy class, those 
who can afford to give a number of weeks to nothing but the 
treatment, and is not adapted to cases wdiere there are com- 
plications. 

The Salisbury Method. — This system, which prescribes 
meat and hot water, is said to be useful in cases of obesity that 
are complicated by digestive disturbances, especially where there 
is a tendency to fermentation. It consists in thoroughly cleans- 
ing the stomach before eating by giving a pint of hot water an 
hour and a half before each meal and at bedtime. If the 
patient experiences any difficulty in taking it, the water may 
be flavored with lemon-juice or weak tea. The principal 
article of diet is finely minced meat, which allows the patient 
to get the maximum of nitrogenous food with the minimum of 
digestive work. It is finely minced to avoid the necessary dis- 
integration by chewing and digestion. The only food permitted 
at first is the minced beef, with clear tea or coffi'C without sugar. 
If there is a craving for other I'oods, a l)it of tenderloin may 
be chewed. Condiments may be taken with the meat, and a 
stalk or two of celery. li' tlicre is a craving for food between 
meals or at night, a small cpiantity of meat-broth or minced 
beef may be given. The amount taken should be an ounce or 
two jit first, to be gradually increased, as the })atient requires it, 
to eight ounces. Not more than a pound should be allowed at 
a meal. Mild aperients may be needed. The method is apt 
to prove tiresome at first, but this weariness will pass off after 
a short time. When the diet is increased, the following articles 
of fi)od may b(; allowed : Mutton, lamb, sweetbread, poultry, 
white fish, soft-l)oil('d or })oa('h('d v^i^i^., baked ])otato, well- 
boiled rice or ma<*aroni, wheat bread (stale and toasted). Two 
mouthfuls of meat should be taken to one of the other Ibods. 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMA EY EACTOE. 639 

The foregoino; restricted diet is to be used only so long as is 
necessary ; being a somewhat severe diet, it is not suitable to a 
large number of patients. Yeo suggests that the diet be in- 
creased, especially at first, by green vegetables, whicli will enable 
the patient to take the meat more easily. The methods of 
mincing beef and pre])aring it are given in the appendix. 

Yeo Method. — Yeo makes the following suggestions lor the 
dieting of obese patients when no complicating disease is ])res- 
ent : The proteins are confined within the limits necessary for 
healthy nutrition. All starchy and farinaceous food is reduced 
to i\ minimum. Sugar is prohibited entirely. In some cases 
he allows a small quantity of fat, for the same reasons given 
by Ebstein. Fluid at meals is to be restricted, but sullicient 
is to be allowed to aid in the digestion of food. Plot water or 
hot aromatic solutions may be allowed freely between meals, 
especially toward the end of digestion, the aim being to aid in 
elimination, especially in the gouty. Xo beer, porter, or sweet 
wine is to be taken, and spirituous liquors only in very small 
quantity. Yeo believes that it should be recognized generally 
that the use of alcohol is a common cause of obesity. The 
only forms in which it should be allowed are as hock, still 
jNIoselle, and light claret, and these only in small quantities. 
All varieties of lean meat may be taken, as well as poultry, 
game, fish (eels, salmon, and mackerel are best avoided), and 
eggs. Meat should not be eaten oftener than twice daily, and 
not more than six ounces of cooked meat should be taken at 
one time. Two lightly boiled eggs or a small portion of grilled 
fish may be taken as another meal. Bread should be toasted 
very thoroughly, and not merely browned on tlie surface. JSoups 
should be prohibited, except a few tablespoonfuls of clear soup 
at dinner. Milk, unless skimmed or when taken as the chief 
article of diet, should be avoided. All milk and farinaceous 
puddings and pastry of all kinds are forbidden. Fresh fruits 
and vegetables, on the other hand, are ])ermitted. Yeo insists 
that individual, and not routine, treatment be carried out. He 
also recommends abundant exercise on foot, and advises that 
the bowels be em])ticd daily by the use of saline purgatives. 

Other Dietetic Methods. — There are so many dietetic methods 
of treating obesity that they cannot all i)e outlined here. The 
best-known dietaries have been described, and by a study of 
these the diversity of opinions that exist can readily be made 
out. Among those that have not been described is Chambers' 
Method^ interesting because it was one of the earliest systematic 



640 I^IET IN DISEASE. 

modes of treatment. It consisted in cutting oif the fat and car- 
bohydrate food, and giving lean meat and green vegetables ; 
sahids, fruits, and the like were to be taken principally between 
meals. An abundance of out-door exercise was ordered, and 
sleep was restricted to seven hours, for Chambers believed that 
remaining in a close room in bed for a longer period than this 
was weakening. 

Boucha7'd^s method is based on the careful examination of the 
urine, the amount of food and the variety to be eaten being- 
regulated according to the findings. He prescribes more car- 
bohydrate and fatty food than protein, and also gives large 
quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, especially those rich 
in potassium salts and organic acids. Our knowledge concern- 
ing the urine and metabolism has not yet reached a stage where 
it may safely be taken as a criterion, certainly not by the 
average practitioner. 

Dujardin-Beaumetz\s method allows a diet somewhat more 
liberal than is prescribed by the Oertcl or the Ebstein method. 
It does not, however, differ essentially from these two methods, 
and for this reason requires no further description here. 

Thyroid gland substance, which is usually given dry in the 
form of tablets, exerts a decided influence over metabolism. 
By its use large amounts of flesh are often lost. It is given in 
five-grain doses several times a day. It should be given in 
small doses at first, and these should be gradually increased, 
the eifect on the heart's action being watched carefully. When 
the use of the drug is discontinued, the weight again increases. 
It is a ddngerous remeAyj capdble of doing rnuch harm, and is 
not to be recommended except in one class of cases — where 
there is a condition of masked myxedema (inyxredeine fruste), 
so well described by Hertoghe, of Antwerp. In these cases 
the drug is of great value, and the loss of weight that follows 
its use brings about renewed health and mental vigor. Small 
doses must be given continuously lest the condition return. 

Th(! (juack cures for obesity are many, and require no com- 
ment here more tiian to say that there is no '^ royal road" to 
leanness. 

DIET FOR LEANNESS. 

It is much easier to reduce a pati(Mit who is obese than to 
Pattciu one who is thin. The measure of success is largely de- 
IX'iulcnt on \\u\ cause of the leanness. About one-half of all 
thin persons are so from hereditary causes, and time and energy 



DISEASES IN WHICH DIET IS A PRIMARY E ACTOR. 641 

are almost wasted in an attempt to fatten tliese. When tliere 
is a definite cause for the emaciation and this can be discovered 
and removed, much can be accomplislied. In these cases relief 
from worry, bustle, and excitement may be all that is necessary. 
More often there is starch dyspepsia, or the patient may be unable 
to take sugar without inducing fermentation and flatulence. 

In a general way, the following suggestions for the relief of 
leanness may be made : The ])atient should lead a quiet, out-of- 
door life, free from care and excitement, and should get sufficient 
sleep. The meals should be ample, and as much carl)ohydrate 
and fiitty food should be taken as is possible. Cream, milk 
and cream, butter, cocoa, and chocolate, bread, cereals (well 
cooked), farinaceous puddings, potatoes, legumes, and sweet 
fruits should all be partaken of in abundance. All sweets — 
honey, syrups, cakes, and the like — may be taken if they agree 
with the digestion. Beer, especially of the darker varieties, 
brown stout, porter, and ale are useful. If wine is ])referred, 
sweet wines or port should be chosen. If alcohol is contrain- 
dicated, malt extracts may be given. 

The patient should avoid strong alcoholic liquors, acids, 
spices, and the like, as well as many green vegetables. In a 
word, the diet should be the reverse of that recommended for 
obesity. (See Kest Cure.) 

SCORBUTUS OR SCURVY. 

It is a curious fiict that as scurvy has become less and less 
common in adults, it has become more and more prevalent in 
infants. 

Scurvy in adults occurs when there is a deficiency of 
fresh food. If fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and fresh meats 
are omitted from the dietary for any length of time, scurvy is 
almost certain to follow. It is the scourge of armies that have 
been forced away from their bases of supplies in an unpro- 
ductive country, wdiere the commissary department is inade- 
quate. During the late civil war lo per cent, of the deaths 
were said to be due to scurvy. In former years, when the 
sailor was not so well cared for as he Is at present, the disease 
was common on shipboard. It is apt to occur in prisons and 
where the hygienic surroundings are faulty. 

It is unnecessary to discuss here the many theories promul- 
gated regarding the nature of the disease. Suffice it to say 
that fresh food contains a principle, be it salts or some unknown 
substance, without which man can not continue in health. This 

41 



642 DIET IN DISEASE. 

substance does not occur alone in vegetables, for the Eskimos, 
who eat practically no vegetables or cereals, are not especially 
affected by the disease. It is the quality of the food and not 
the quantity eaten that is the causative factor. 

The prophylactic treatment of this disease is important, and 
has been recognized for many years. The boards of trade did 
much to prevent the disease among sailors by requiring that on 
all long voyages where fresh food could not be carried lime- 
juice be given to the men in sufficient quantities. With the 
introduction of better methods of preserving food the tendency 
to scurvy has been lessened, although canned foods do not form 
an ideal preventive against scurvy. If fresh meats and vege- 
tables cannot be obtained, canned vegetables and fruits, as well 
as vinegar, lime-juice, or lemon-juice, should be supplied. 
Onions are also valuable. 

The treatment of scurvy is very simple and mainly dietetic. 
The patient sliould be placed upon a good nutritious diet of 
fresh food. Lime-, lemon-, or orange-juice should ])e given 
freely. Potatoes, onions, and all varieties of green vegetables 
should be used plentifully, and fresh milk should be given. If 
the mouth is so sore as to interfere with mastication, soups and 
broths, made of the articles just mentioned, and fresh fruit- 
juices should be given. AVright has expressed the opinion that 
the neutral citrates and tartrates are better than the fresh fruit- 
juices, since tlie latter, he believes, are apt to j)rolong the oozing of 
l)l()od from the moutli. Practically, however, there is no reason 
why the fresh fruit-juices should not be given, for they seem to 
act admirably. AVhen the proper dietetic means are not at 
hand to treat the case, every eif'ort should be made to secure 
some form of green vegetal^les or berries. Acetic acid or tlie 
chlorate or bitartrate of })otas]i may also be prescribed. 

Infantile Scurvy (Barlow's Disease). — One of tlie 

best contributions to this subject is the Arncric<tn I^edidfric 
Socicftfs (Y)//('f'fu'e LiveMir/atioii of ]ii fan file Sciirrif, l<Sf)<S. In 
this, IMU cases were reported. Age is a marked factor, and 
four-fifths of the cases were between the sixth and the fifteenth 
month, and one-half between the seventh and the t(Mith month. 
The feeding prior to the onset of the disease was as Ibllows :

UNCLASSIFIED DISEASES. 643 

From the foregoing table it will l)e seen that the proprietary 
foods are the most frequent cause, sterilized milk being next in 
frequency. Ccmdensed milk, likewise, is not to be overlooked 
as a cause. One should be cautious not to keep a child on 
sterilized or condensed milk for too long a time, and this should 
be explained to the mother. If circumstances necessitiite the 
use of any of these foods, a teaspoonful of fresh orange-juice or 
a portion of baked apple should be given every day or every 
few days. The ])roprietary foods that are to be mixed with 
water alone should never be used except as a temporary expe- 
dient in illness. 

The treatment of infantile scurvy, unless com])licated by 
other diseases or associated with marasmus, is, if properly con- 
ducted, most satisfactory and simple. It is })urely dietetic. 
The infant should be placed on a suitable mixture of pure fresh 
milk, according to the rules laid down for the feeding of infimts. 
Some form of fresh fruit-juice, scraped ripe apple, or grapes 
from which skins and seeds have been removed, or any fresh 
ripe fruit, may be used. From one-half to three or four ounces 
may be given daily. Among the very poor the authors have 
used lemon-juice with benefit. Potatoes have been highly rec- 
ommended, especially for older infants. A well-baked, mealy 
potato is beaten up with a small quantity of milk to the consist- 
ence of thick cream, and a teaspoonful or two of this is added 
to each bottle. 

The symptoms will usually become less marked in a few- 
days, and in uncomplicated cases of average severity complete 
recovery will follow in one or two weeks. When there is 
anemia, cod-liver oil and iron are of service.

CANCER AND DEMINERALIZED FOOD. 

Horace Packard (^Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, March 
21, 1912, p. 452) has called attention to a point which is well 
worthy of study, and that is that the great increase in cancer 
has apparently follow^ed the use of foods which have been more 
or less demineralized, and that by living u})on such foods the 
resistance to cancer, whatever the nature of it may be, is greatly 
diminished. The foods which have thus been robbed of a very 
essential part are wheat or, in countries w^here rice is exten- 
sively used, rice ; the outer surface of both grains being re- 
moved, there is left chiefly a residue of starch. Potatoes peeled 



644 DIET IN DISEASE. 

and cooked by boiling lose perhaps 50 per cent, of their min- 
eral content. Packard, having this theory of mineral starva- 
tion in mind, has been giving to some of his inoperable recur- 
rent cancer cases a diet rich in minerals, and has found appar- 
ently an arrest of the disease and a general condition of good 
health quite at variance with former experiences in similar 
cases. His dietary is as follows : 

(1) Exclude all white flour bread, and all articles into which 
white flour enters, and substitute bread made from whole wheat 
flour. There are whole wheat flours on the market which are 
finely milled and which are satisfactory. 

i'l) Potatoes, next to bread, form the most important and 
widely used article of diet, and properly conserved in cooking 
they are rich in the food salts, which are located in the periph- 
eral portion immediately beneath the skin. Therefore, one or 
two baked potatoes daily are advised, prepared as follows : Dis- 
card the heart or central starchy portion and eat the peripheral 
portions rich in mineral ingredients, conserving to the very 
outer skin. The common way of cooking potatoes by paring 
raw, soaking in cold water for an hour or two, then boiling, 
dissolves out and boils out about 50 per cent, of the food salts. 

(3) Encourage the eating freely of well-cooked fresh vege- 
tables, apples raw or cooked in any way, and fresh ripe fruits. 

(4) Meats and fish may be used moderately, according to in- 
clination, bearing in mind that these probably make no differ- 
ence one way or the other in the development or growth of 
cancer. Flesh foods, as consumed by the human family, are 
relatively poor in the food salts, and at best the elements of 
such fi)od reach us second hand and constitute a very poorly 
balanced article of diet, in that we consume almost exclusively 
the muscle tissue, thus getting none of the food salts stored in 
tlie nerves, bones, and other structures. 

A normal amount of protein must be included in the dietary, 
and if not t;d<en as flesh food or in vegetables, it must be made 
U}) in eggs, cheese, milk, and leguminous vegetables. 



EXOPHTHALMIC GOITER. 

In this disease th(^ diet sliould be nutritious, and indigestible 
fi)o(l should be avoided. Milk may be given in as large quan- 
titi<'s as the patient can assimilat(\ Any tendency to consti- 
pation -liould be relieved promj)tly. I^^kkIs that are apt to 
cause flatulency (7. v.) should be avoided. 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE SKIN 645 

Tea, coifee, and tobacco should be abstained from, or, if the 
patient refuses to do this, their use limited to the smallest pos- 
sible amount. Alcohol should be prohibited, exce})t in habitues, 
when sudden withdrawal may cause great cardiac weakness. 
In some cases, if necessary, alcohol may be used as a heart 
stimulant. 

ADDISON^S DISEASE. 

So long as the digestion is not seriously impaired a mixed 
diet, of as nutritious a mixture as possible, should be given. 
]\Iilk and cream, fresh meat, fish, oysters, well-cooked vege- 
tables, and farinaceous food may be used. Good wines or 
spirituous liquors may be allowed in small quantities if desired, 
or when needed as either a tonic or a stimulant. 

AVhen gastric irritability occurs, the treatment is the same as 
that for nervous vomiting — liquid, even predigested, food should 
be given in small quantities (see Nervous Vomiting and Feed- 
ing after Laparotomies). In some cases a mixture of two parts 
of lime-water and one ])art of milk may be used with advan- 
tage. If this is not retained, teaspoonful doses, given regularly 
every fifteen minutes, may be tried. In the worst cases rectal 
feeding may be instituted for several days, thus giving the 
stomach a complete rest. 

AVhen the patient becomes weakened, even when no special 
gastric symptoms exist, it is well to give food at short and 
regular intervals. Liquid and predigested food, together with 
milk, custards, egg-nog, sherry and egg, broths, and gruels are 
to be ordered. Liquid beef peptonoids, panopepton, and similar 
preparations are useful, as are also malted milk and the various 
infant foods. 

OSTEOMALACIA. 

As nutritious and as generous a diet as the patient can digest 
should be given. It has been recommended that an abundance 
of salts be "taken. Phosphates and hypophos])liites with cod- 
liver oil are perhaps the best means of supplying salts to the 
system. The disease requires further study. 

DIET IN DISEASES OF THE SKIN. 

Certain skin ailections are caused directly or indirectly by 
dietary errors ; others are prolonged or intensified by an improper 
diet, and still others are connectcKl in some way with diseases of 
the alimentary tract or with disturbed metabolism. 



646 DIET IN DISEASE. 

The belief that skin diseases are caused by improper food is 
very prevalent among the laity, and the effect of diet on the 
skin is often overestimated because of the common habit, which 
some ])hysicians have, of ascribing almost all skin lesions to a 
disordered stomach. 

Certain foods may cause skin lesions, usually of the urticarial 
type, in from a few minutes to several days after ingestion. 
This is evidently, in some cases, the result of reflex action ; hi 
others, of toxic substances in tlie food. These lesions are 
usually, though not always, dependent on idiosyncrasy. Brocq 
held that skin diseases may be engendered by the prolonged use 
of certain foods, and maintained that the disease might only 
appear years later. This has never been proved, and therefore 
requires no discussion. 

In such metabolic diseases as gout and diabetes tlie existence 
of some of the lesions may be ex])lained on the ground that 
irritating abnormal by-products are excreted together with the 
sweat. 

Certain poisons taken in with the food may give rise to condi- 
tions in wliich skin manifestations ])lay an im])ortant part. In 
this connection maybe mentioned ergotism and pellagra. Alco- 
hol and ^'toper's nose '^ (acne rosiicea) are commonly c()U})led in 
tlie mind, although the latter may occur in individuals who have 
never used alcohol. 

The sugii-estions which follow for the dietetic management of 
eczema may be employed with advantage in the treatment of 
most curable skin diseases, as it consists chiefly in getting the 
])atient into the best possible physical condition. 

The Use of Milk in Certain Skin Diseases. — Bulk- 
ky has called attention to the idea of giving milk alone, either 
pure or diluted with boiling water at the body tem])erature, just 
after the alkaline tide has set in, or during its continuance, to 
avoid foo<l or any substance that could call forth gastric secre- 
tion until after its al)sorption has been fully accomplished. The 
milk should have nothing whatever added to it, neither whisky 
nor e<r<r, and the eatinu' of anvthinti' with the milk should be 
forbidden. In order to be sure that the stomach is in an al- 
kaline condition, the milk is better given an houroreven thirty 
minutes beibi-e the next meal time; and sometimes it is ot* ad- 
vantage to give bicarbonate of so<la in lull doses half an hoin' 
or so before taking the milk, or the milk may be rendered dis- 
tinctly alkaline by the addiiion of bicai-bonate of >o<la. The 
milk should not be over 100'^ I\, and should not be too rich 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE SKIN. 647 

in fat. Given at that time milk is often well borne, and in in- 
dividuals who otherwise would not be able to take it, the addi- 
tional nourishment causes gain hi weight, and may be used with 
benefit in cases of acne, eczema, and psoriasis, especially in the 
more chronic form. 

ECZEMA. 

The diet of both acute and chronic eczema is important. In 
general it may be stated that the pro])hylaxis in predisposed 
individuals consists in a simple varied diet, and the avoidance of 
such articles of food as are known to cause attacks of erythema 
or urticaria in the patient under treatment. It should be re- 
membered that one patient will eat with impunity a food that 
will poison another. (See Urticaria.) In addition, anything 
known to cause intestinal disturbance or indigestion should be 
avoided. 

When eczema is present, the indications are to avoid indiges- 
tion and disturbances of the stomach and bowels. In the gouty 
the diet should be regulated according to the suggestions laid 
down for the management of gout. Other coexisting diseases 
should also be considered from a dietetic standpoint. 

The habits of the patient should carefully be considered. If 
the nutrition is below normal, efforts should be made to improve 
it by means of nourishing food, such as milk, eggs, and meat. 
If, as is more often the case, the patient overeats or is obese, 
the diet should be restricted. The patient should avoid all 
indigestible articles, and partake of a diet varied according to 
his taste, but reduced in quantity. Alcoholic drinks of all kinds 
should, as a rule, be prohibited, and coftee and tea taken in great 
moderation, if at all. In obese patients careful regidation of the 
diet according to one of the methods described in the treatment 
of obesity will usually answer the purpose. 

When the disease is due to indigestion, the result of improper 
feeding, the diet should be regulated according to the form of 
disease present. All indigestible and fried foods, pickles, and 
strongly seasoned or very rich foods should be avoided. Tlie 
digestion is often disturbed, particularly in womeu, by over- 
indulgence in sweets and pastry, especially at wrong hours. In 
all cases the food should be plain, well cooked, and taken at 
regular intervals, no solid food being allowed between meals. 

Schweninger recommends in some cases smaller meals than 
are ordinarily taken, at shorter intervals ; in others, that the 
meal shall consist of but one or two dishes. 

In the very severe acute or persistent forms, an absolute milk 



648 DIET IN DISEASE. 

diet or a diet composed largely of milk should be prescribed. 
(See Milk Cure.) 

Kc^ema in Infants. — If the child is nursiug, the milk 
should be examined, and if, as is usually the case, the milk is 
found to be very rich and the baby is fat and well nourished, an 
attempt should be made to reduce the amount of fat in the 
mother's milk according to the directions given in the section 
on Infant Feeding. Malt and alcoholic liquors of all kinds 
should be forbidden, and the amount of meat ingested should be 
reduced and exercise increased. 

In some cases, where the proteins are at fault, the child suffers 
from indigestion and colic and curds are found in the stools. 
The child usually, although not always, appears to be well 
nourished. The amount of food given the infant should be 
lessened, either by shortening the time the infant nurses or by 
lengthening the intervals. The child should be urged to take 
water between the nursings ; an alkaline water, such as Vichy, 
will be found of value. If the child is thin and poorly nour- 
ished, fat in addition to that contained in the milk should be 
given. Cream or cod-liver oil may be used for tliis purpose. 
This is not advisable in fat, well-nourished infants, for in them 
the disease may be due to an excess of fat in the food. 

In artificially fed infants Holt advises giving first a food 
moderately high in fat and low in protein, and then, if the de- 
sired effect is not produced, a milk low in fat and protein. 

What has been said of the treatment of adults ap])lies as well 
t<» older cliildren. In the latter the disease is generally due to 
the excessive use of starches or sugars. Pickles and indigestible 
cold lunches may be the cause of this condition in school-chil- 
dren. The diet should be regulated according to the rules given, 
and if the disease still jx-rsists, a milk diet may be tried. The 
drinking of water between meals is oiten of value. 

URTICARIA. 

The first step in the treatment of urticaria is to secure h'(?Q 
evacuation of the bowels. I^»r this purpose an active saline, 
such as sulphate of magnesia, slioiild l)e given. Following this, 
the diet should be very simple until the urticaria has disappeared. 
Preferably a milk diet should be given, lime-water or an effer- 
vescing water being added to the milk if necessary; if thei'e is 
indigestion, the milk may be pe|>toni/e(l. When there is a 
diminution in the (|uantity of ui'ine excreted, alkaline diui'etics 
may be prescribed or Vichy water may be driuik freely. 



DIET IN DISEASES OF THE SKIN. 649 

In many individuals the attacks are brought on by certain 
articles of diet. What these are may generally be determined 
by careful observation. Oysters, crabs, and other shellfish are 
a frequent cause. These and other articles of diet, if they are 
not fresh or are beginning to spoil, are also frequently respon- 
sible for this disturbance. Strawberries produce a red rash of an 
urticarial nature in many persons. When the offending article 
has been discovered, it should be eliminated from the dietary. 

ACNE, 

In certain persons acne may be overcome by careful dieting. 
In some, special articles of diet, such as buckwheat cakes and 
other fried foods, greasy doughnuts, rich pies and cakes, and, in 
fact, almost any indigestible article of diet, have been held re- 
sponsible for the disease. 

In giving directions regarding the diet it is well to prohibit 
all indigestible foods, such as those just mentioned, and to pre- 
scribe a substantial varied diet of fresh food of the more easily 
digestible kinds. In the severe and resistant cases a milk diet 
may be tried, and Moser and Peiper suggest that milk be skimmed 
to remove the most of the fat. Bulkley forbids fats, butter, 
alcohol, smoked meats, and many other articles of diet. Other 
authors interdict tea, coffee, cheese, fish, and a host of other 
foods have been named as injurious. 

The bowels should be regulated, and hot water or Vichy 
taken freely between meals. Careful dietary studies made in 
connection with acne might prove of consideral)le value. 

ACNE ROSACEA. 

As has been said elsewhere, this is generally coupled in the 
minds of the laity with alcoholism. Although alcohol is often 
a causative factor, the disease occurs also in those who never use 
alcoholic beverages. Jackson maintains that the use of large 
quantities of strong tea niay also })roduce it. In general the 
diet should be bland and unirritating. Rich and highly sea- 
soned food, as well as alcohol, should be avoided. Tea and 
coflPee, if used at all, should be taken in small quantities and 
not too strong. The diet should be similar to that prescribed 
for eczema. Many of the patients, it will be found, ])refcr the 
pleasures of the table to a possible betterment of the skin disease. 



650 DIET IN DISEASE. 

PSORIASIS. 

Diet is apparently of little value in the treatment of this con- 
dition. Many authors have recommended various forms of diet, 
but in general it may be said of this, as of other skin diseases, 
that the diet should be such as the general condition of the 
patient demands. If the patient is thin and debilitated, a nour- 
ishinc: diet should be ordered, whereas if he is obese, his diet 
should be restricted. 

Brocq insisted on the value of regulating the diet of pa- 
tients of gouty families according to the lines laid down in 
the section on Gout. Other authors recommend that the use 
of coffee, tea, alcohol, and tobacco be prohibited in nervous 
individuals. 

PRURITUS. 

The existence of gout, diabetes, and diseases of the liver, 
kidney, or alimentary tract should be definitely determined, and 
if such disease is found to exist, the diet should be reo^ulated 
accordingly. In severe cases a milk diet may be ordered, and 
an abundance of mineral water between meals and on rising:. 

All irritating articles of diet should be avoided. All highly 
seasoned and indigestible dishes, pepper, especially paprika, 
spices, and the like, should not be used. Brocq advises that 
the following articles be withheld : t<jbacco, alcohol, tea, coffee, 
fish, crabs, sausage, and cheese. 

FURUNCULOSIS. 

There is no special diet for furunculosis. The general nutri- 
tion should be improved by ])rescribing a varied diet of well- 
prepared food. If there is disease of the alimentary tract, the 
diet should be snch as is indicated in that disease. If diabetes 
or anemia coexist, they should receive attention. 



SPECIAL CURES. 

THE MILK CURE, 

While milk is used extensively in the treatment of many 
diseases, it has also been advocated as a special curative agent. 
Karell, of St. Petersburg, and Weir Mitchell are among the 
chief exponents of this method of treating disease. 

An exclusive milk diet has been used with good effect in 
renal, hepatic, and cardiac dropsy ; in congestion, simple hyper- 
trophy, and fatty conditions of the liver ; in various gastric 
and intestinal disorders, particularly in those associated with 
defective nutrition, such as chronic indigestion, chronic colitis, 
and chronic intestinal neuralgia ; in asthma due to emphysema 
or catarrhal conditions ; in obesity ; and in functional nervous 
conditions in w^hich the nutrition is greatly lowered. Karell 
has also advocated the milk cure in organic disease of the heart 
and blood-vessels, in advanced kidney disease, and in rheumatic 
and gouty diseases. 

Method of Administration. — Well-skimmed milk from 
the country, as fresh as can be procured, is used. 

Karell uses from three to six ounces three or four times a 
day and increases the amount gradually. The milk is to be 
taken slowly at regular intervals, allowing it to mix with the 
saliva. In winter it is warmed and in summer it is given at 
the temperature of the room. After a w^ek, if the stools re- 
main solid, the quantity is increased, two liters a day being 
given during the second week in favorable cases. The meals 
are given at fixed intervals and the hours rigidly adhered to. 
If there is diarrhea, the milk may be boiled. Karell insists on 
small quantities at the outset and that the milk be skimmed. 

Constipation is regarded as a sign that the milk is agreeing, 
and may be relieved, if necessary, by enemata, or rhubarb or 
castor oil may be used. Small quantities of coff'ee mixed with 
the morning's milk or stewed prunes or baked apples in the 
afternoon are also helpful in relieving constipation. 

If flatulence occurs, it may be attributed to the fact that too 
much milk is being given or that it has not been properly skimmed. 
If there is thirst, plain water or seltzer water may be given. 

651 



652 SPECIAL CURES. 

During the second or third week, if there is an irresistiVjle 
craving for solid food, a bit of stale bread with salt or a small 
amount of salt herring may be given. Once a day milk soup, 
thickened with a cereal, may be given. After five or six weeks 
one other article of food may be allowed for dinner, and if the 
desired effect has been produced, a gradual return may be made 
to an ordinary diet, which should, however, still contain con- 
siderable milk. 

Mitchell gives four ounces of milk every two hours, gradually 
increasing the dose and lengthening the interval to three hours. 
He also prescribes a glass at night, if necessary, mixed with 
lime-water, or, later in the cure, mixed with one of tlie lactated 
infant's foods. He also insists on the necessity for prescribing 
rest with this treatment. 

]\Iitchell has described the effects of the milk treatment in 
general as follows : ^' For the first week or two there is drowsi- 
ness, the tongue is coated, and there is a peculiar taste in the 
mouth. The patients at first lose a little weight, and later on 
generally gain considerably. The stools are light yellow and 
have a peculiar odor, like the milk stools of infancy. There is 
an increase in the quantity of urine, which may exceed the 
quantity of fluid taken into the system." 

By this treatment many remarkable cures are effected in 
obstinate cases especially in those neuroses attended with emacia- 
tion, the improvement being due evidently to the rest and the 
easily assimilated diet. 

WHEY CURE. 

In some of the foreign hcaltli resorts a cure somewhat similar 
to the milk cure has been employed, and consists in the drink- 
ing, at stated intervals, of warm whey to which alkaline 
mineral waters have l)een added. About one and one-half 
pints are taken daily. The amount of meat taken is limited, 
juid the (juantity of fruit and vegetables is increased. This 
method of treatment is said to be of value in laryngeal coughs, 
in elii-onie eatarrhal conditions of the lungs or intestine, in 
elironie iiephi-itis, and in chronic ])lithisis. 

KUMISS CURE. 

This is a mode of cure much \\-vi\ in Russia. Patients who 
are to take the cure are generally sent to the country, where 
kumiss can be had. It is given Irequently during the day — as 



BUTTERMILK CURE. 653 

often as every half-hour — but not for two hours before a heavy 
meal, the doses beiug gradually iucreased. The diet used with 
it consists cliieHy of meat aud fat. Sugar, fruits, salads, iees, 
coffee, and alcohol are abstained from. If it causes diarrhea, 
lime-water is added. During cold weatlier it ])ro(luces an in- 
crease in the excretion of urine, and during warm, it increases 
the perspiration. Constipation is overcome and there is a gain 
in weight. Slight drowsiness, as in the milk cure, may occur, 
and stimulation of the sexual organs may take place. 

This cure is useful in pulmonary tuberculosis and when there 
is a decided lowering of the nutrition. The effects are those 
obtained from a generous diet combined with open-air life. 



BUTTERMILK CURE. 

Of recent years buttermilk and allied preparations have been 
used very extensively by the laity in the treatment of a great 
many different conditions. Buttermilk has certain uses in a 
diet, and the following conditions in which it is of particular 
value should be borne in mind : (a) Where fat is not digested, 
especially in acute or chronic fat diarrhea ; (6) in infants and 
children where there is marasmus or malnutrition, due to fat 
diarrhea or indigestion ; (c) in certain forms of chronic dys- 
pepsia, especially those in which there is constipation ; (d) in 
fermentative diarrheas ; {(^ in typhoid fever, where ordinary 
milk is not well borne ; (/) following surgical operations, where 
the patient does not bear ])lain milk well. 

The curative effects of buttermilk depend chiefly on two 
things : First, the low fat content, making it of great value 
where fat is not well borne ; and, secondly, the presence of the 
lactic acid bacilli. In fermentative conditions lactic acid bacilli 
seem to be able to drive out the offending bacteria, and so re- 
establish a more or less normal bacterial flora in the intestinal 
tract. Whole milk, which has been inoculated with lactic acid 
bacilli, is frequently substituted for buttermilk, but it should be 
borne in mind that these preparations should not be used where 
the disease is due to fat indigestion. 

Metclmikoff has extolled the virtues of the Bulgarian butter-

frequently used in this country. 



654 SPECIAL CURES. 

THE YOLK CURE. 

Yolk of egg has been recommended in diabetes (see same), 
and also as a most desireable food for the underfed and individ- 
uals suifering from malnutrition. In many cases where the 
whole e<r^: is not well borne the yolks may be used to great ad- 
vantage. From 10 to 40 yolks may be taken daily in addition 
to some other food. The fat, lecithin, and ferments found in 
the yollc render it particularly suited to individuals whose nutri- 
tion is below par and who do not do well on ordinary diets. 

Stern ^ gives the following sample diet, outlined for a consump- 
tive weighing 50 kilos (110 lbs.), whose normal weight should 
be 63.G kilos (140 lbs.) :

DIET CURES. 

Numerous methods of curing various diseases by means of 
special diets Iiave l)een advocated by ]>hysicians and layuKMi 
irom time to time. I'^or the most part they have been the out- 
come of ignorance or of fanaticism, and tliey have often been 
associated with some religious exercise. Tlieir ])opularity has, 
as a rule, been ephemeral. Tliey are suited to tlnx-^e who 
hal)itually overeat. Among the better known are the f(>llo\ving :

DIET CURES. 655 

The Grape Cure. — This is carried out chiefly in grape- 
growing countries during the vintage season. It is recom- 
mended for chronic constipation, for those individuals wlio have 
enhirged congested livers, for obesity, and for various lithemic 
conditions ; its use has also been suggested for many other con- 
ditions of the lungs, stomach, etc. 

The cure consists in visiting the grape district and in eating 
from four to six pounds of grapes daily. Even large quantities 
are sometimes taken. It is reconmiended that the fruit be 
taken, when possible, on rising and between meals. When this 
disagrees, as it often does, the grapes are taken at the close of a 
meal. The patient is given at the same time an easily digested 
but nutritious diet. The grapes have a decidedly laxative 
effect, which, combined with the change of scene and j)leasant 
outing, often produces most beneficial results. When taken in 
too large quantities or in poorly selected cases, unpleasant symp- 
toms, such as sw^elling of the gums from the acid and diarrhea, 
may occur. 

Other Fruit Cures. — Other fruits are often used in vari- 
ous cures lasting from a month to six weeks. Apples, pears, 
oranges, lemons, in fact, almost all fruits have been vaunted at 
some time as cures. Various methods are followed, the basis 
of all beino: a p:reatlv restricted diet with an abundance of fruit. 

They are used in the same diseased conditions for which the 
grape cure has been prescribed. 

Dry Cure. — This consists in taking as little water as is 
consistent with life. The water taken in addition to tliat con- 
tained in the food has been restricted in some cases to a pint a 
day. This treatment has been recommended for effusions in 
the serous cavities and joints, in obesity, and in gastric dilata- 
tion. Many unpleasant and dangerous symptoms may follow 
this treatment. TufnelFs treatment for aneurysm is founded 
on the same principle. 

Schroth'S Cure. — This is a form of the dry cure used in 
Europe for dilatation of the stomach, chronic peritonitis, and 
various other conditions. The amount of food is reduced for 
several days, and then nothing is given l)ut dried bread, with 
the addition, at dinner, of boiled vegetables. A small quan- 
tity of hot w^ine is allowed to quench the thirst. When the 
thirst becomes intolerable, the patient is given large quantities 
of hot wine and then the quantity is again reduced. This 
treatment is severe, and great sufferin^r is engendered, danger- 
ous and even fatal com])lications often ensuing. It has been 
said to be beneficial in some cases. 



656 SPECIAL CUBES. 

The Meat and the Hot-water Cure. — These resemble 
somewhat the Carlsbad and similar dietetic methods used in 
obesity and in dilatation of the stomach. The diet consists 
chiefly of meat-fiber, eggs, and dry toast. Hot water is taken 
before meals and at bedtime. 

The Kneipp Cure. — This consists chiefly of a diet of 
fruit, bread, and milk, with small quantities of meat and vege- 
tables. The cure directs that the patient walk barefooted in 
the grass while tlie dew is still on it. It became popular a few 
years ago among the faddists and among those who habitually 
overfed. 

SALT-FREE DIET. 

This has been mentioned in connection with several diseases, 
and a few words concerning it will be found useful. The 
sodium-chlorid content of the body is of great importance, 
and what might be called sodium-chlorid equilibrium is main- 
tained in normal individuals. If the amount taken in the food 
is increased, there is an increase in the elimination, and if the 
amount be reduced, there is a diminution in the output ; but a 
certain amount, about 2 grams, nmst be taken daily to make up 
for the inevitable daily loss. The ordinary intake of sodium 
chlorid is about 15 to 20 grams a day, and if this is omitted 
from the diet, there is a corresponding loss of fluid from the 
body of about 1 to 2 kilograms. 

Carnivorous animals and ])eople do not use salt and may 
object to it, while herbivorous animals and vegetarians require 
it ; and the average omnivorous man also craves it, and the 
average individual takes much more than needed simply because 
the taste for salt is cultivated by many. The large amount of 
])otassium in the vegetables drives out the sodium of the sodium 
chlorid in the tissue, ilice, which contains but little potassium, 
i- the exception, and rice-eating ]K'()])les do not have the salt crav- 
iiiL!' as markedly as other vegetable-eating pe()])les. In some dis- 
eases, as in nephritis, there is a disturbance of salt metabolism, 
and, as a rule, there is salt retention. H there is unilateral 
kidney disease, there may be ditfcrences in the salt output of 
the two ki(hievs. In normal individuals the addition of an 
extra amount of sodium (chlorid causes an increase in the (ex- 
cretion, but when; there is salt retention it do(\s not. Salt re- 
tention is generally accompanied by edema. First there is an 
increase in weight before the edema is apparent. It is usually 
assumed that tlui salt retention causes the retention of tiie water. 
The retention of the water, however, would cause a retention of 



DIET CURES. 657 

the sodium chlorld in order to bring up the fluid to the pro})er 
composition. All edemas are not due to salt retention, a fact 
that nuist constantly he borne in mind in using salt-free diets. 

When edema is due to salt retention, the restriction of the 
intake of salt will aid greatly in the elimination of the fluid. 
Restriction of salt generally causes an increase in the elimina- 
tion of it, due, doubtless, to the increased permeability of the 
kidney due to the rest. This excessive secretion keej)S up until 
conditions in the body have become normal. If carried to ex- 
cess, salt restriction may cause edema. Salt restriction also 
favors sweating and elimination of ^vater through the lungs. 

Salt restriction must be practised consistently over consider- 
able periods of time, and ,it may be one or two weeks before 
the effect begins to be noticed, and even six or seven weeks 
may elapse before improvement takes place. Generally the 
effect is prompt; occasionally there may be a temporary increase 
in the edema, followed by great benefit. The diet may be 
kept as near the minimum requirement of 2 grams a day as 
long as necessary. The increase should be made slowly and 
the effect noted. 

Salt restriction may be tried in the edema of nephritis, and 
in that from heart disease and from other causes. It may be 
tried in diabetes insipidus, in which disease it is said to be of 
occasional service ; in all conditions in which it is desirable to 
limit the intake of water, as in obesity, heart disease, and when 
there are serous exudates. In extremely nervous and irritable 
people it may be tried, and it has been suggested in epilepsy. 
It increases the potency of the bromids. It has been suggested 
in scarlet fever as a })rotection against ne})hritis. It has also 
been advised in tinnitus aurium, especially that occurring in 
Bright's disease, and also in the chronic obstructive nasal catarrh 
which is sometimes seen as an accompaniment of the same dis- 
ease. Various skin diseases, as certain forms of pemphigus, 
have also been treated in this way, and a trial may be made in 
certain persistent eczemas. 

Richartz has suggested the use of salt restriction in the treat- 
ment of gastric hy})ersecretion. He also suggests the use of 
systematic lavage in these cases. The treatment should extend 
over a long period of time to secure the best results. 

The tables in the article on Salts and on Gastric Hy|)eracidity 
will be found of interest in connection with the practical appli- 
cation of this form of therapy. 

A salt-free diet may be easily arranged with the cooperation 
of the cook, and may consist of the following articles of diet, 
42 



658 SPECIAL CURES. 

from which the patient cau very easily subsist. These can be 
modified according to the disease for which the patients are 
being dieted : 

Bread should be made without salt. The average bread con- 
tains about 10 grams for eacli kilogram^ sometimes more. The 
bread which has not had salt added to it contains about 0.7 
eg. ])er kilo. 

^Nleat should always be used fresh, and most people experience 
little difficulty in eating it without salt. The cook should be 
instructed not to use salt in its preparation. Meat contains on 
an average about 1 gram per kilo. 

Fresh-water fish may be used, but salt-water varieties contain 
large amounts of sodium chlorid. 

Fresh cgg^ may be taken in any form desired, each egg con- 
taining about 25 eg. 

l^Tsli butter that is unsalted, fresh cream, and saltless 
cheese may be used freely. 

Potatoes may be prepared in many varieties of ways, and 
may be made palatable without the addition of salt. The same 
is true of rice. 

Ju addition to the above, green peas, carrots, leeks, endive, 
lettuce, Fren(;h beans, celery, artichokes, and salads of various 
kinds may be added to the dietary. 

Sweet meats, pastry made without salt, and raw or cooked 
fruit may also be used. 

Chocolate will be found of especial value. 

Tea, coffee, and beer, or even wine may be taken as far as 
the amount of chlorids which they contiun are concerned. 

Forced Feeding. — Forced or excessive feeding is utilized 
with })enefit in certain diseased conditions with certain limita- 
tions (see Tuberculosis, tlie liest Cure;, and Diseases of the 
Stomach), but it is well to note that in most conditions forced 
feeding is ])roductive of unsatisfactory results, and the effect on 
normal individuals is distinctly bad. The effect of the exces- 
sive diet is a rapid inci'case in weight during the ])eriod which 
the individual is so fed, and gcnci'al symptoms of discomfort, 
>\wh as heaviness, indisposition to exercise, feeling of distention 
and weight in the abdomen, disturbed sleep, sometimes dyspnea 
on exertion, often ])ain in the region of the liver and, later, 
diarrhea, often of a severe type. There is marked increase in 
the inorganic constituents of the iii-ine, the urine is increased 
in (|Uantity, and there is a marked increase in the (piantity of 
total nitrogen in the ui-ine, the ])r()j)oi"tion passed as lu'ea remain- 
ing: normal. 



THE DIETETIC MANAGEMENT OF SURGICAL 

CASES. 

Preparation for Operation. — Surgical operations that 
must be performed immediately, of course, admit of no pre])ara- 
tion. Most operations, however, may be postponed for several 
days or longer, thus enabling the patient to be put in good con- 
dition by rest, preferably in bed, and a nourishing, easily di- 
gested diet. This is of great importance in nervous women, 
and no major operation should be undertaken, except when 
urgently demanded, without giving the patient the benefit of 
the ^^ building-up process.^' A plan that seems to be popular at 
the present day, especially among gynecologists, is to operate 
first and then to build up the patient. Were this plan reversed, 
many operations could be avoided altogether. The truth of 
this is illustrated by the following case : A nervous young 
woman of twenty was advised by a surgeon to undergo opera- 
tion for the anclioring of a movable kidney. Later she con- 
sulted an eminent physician, who prescribed rest with pro})er 
nourishment under the care of a competent nurse. In six 
weeks' time her gain in weight was such that tlie kidney be- 
came anchored in normal fat, whereas all nervous symptoms 
had disappeared. 

The value of rest in bed is greatly augmented by massage, 
electricity, and baths ; by tonics ; and by laxatives to correct 
the tendency to constipation that usually exists. 

Diet and I/aparotomies. — One or two days previous to 
the operation the bowels should be cleansed thoroughly by a 
saline, such as sul])hate of magnesia, and in the case of abdom- 
inal or pelvic operations, an enema or two may be given in 
addition, the object being not only to secure cleanliness, but to 
obtain rest for the bowels. Licorice powder may be substituted 
as a laxative, or in delicate })atients aloes, cascara sagrada, or 
citrate of magnesia may be employed. The washing-out of 
the rectum should be performed early on the morning of the 
operation — at six or seven o'clock or at least three hours before 
the operation. 

659 



660 DIETETIC MANAGEMENT OF SURGICAL CASES. 

The diet on the day previous to the operation should be light. 
On the morning of the operation a glass of milk or a cup of 
very weak cocoa or beef-tea should be given. There is no 
objection to adding a small piece of toast, a biscuit, or a cracker. 
This should, however, precede the operation by at least three 
f)r four hours. If the operation is performed early in the 
morning, nothing need be given before it. Operation upon the 
gastro-intestinal tract should be proceeded by the special diet 
given below (Diet following Operation on the Stomach). 

After the operation there is usually nausea. This may be 
lessened or entirely prevented by a method which has been 
practised for some time in Halsted's service at the Johns Hop- 
kins Hospital and in Finney's at the Union Protestant Infirm- 
ary of Baltimore in all cases of ether anesthesia ; namely, 
wasliing-out of the stomach after all surgical procedures while 
the patient is on the table and still under the influence of the 
anesthetic. C. S. White, ^ too, extols this method in a recent 
report, in which he shows that in a series of 20 consecutive 
cases, 60 per cent, did not vomit, while in 100 consecutive cases 
of etlier anesthesia without lavage only 30 per cent, did not 
vomit. 

As a rule, nothing should be given by moutli for twenty-four 
hours. Very small quantities of carbonated water or iced 
water or of very hot water may be ii;I\'en, or, if the |)atient 
is weak and in need of noui'ishment, milk may be given in 
teaspoonful doses, lime-watcn* or a carbonated water may be 
added to the milk if necessary. Hot weak tea is often accept- 
able to the patient, and if there is lU'ed of a stinuilant, strong 
black coffee may be administered ; or if an alcoholic stimulant 
is desired, champagne in small doses or good l)randy diluted 
with aerated water may be ])re<eril)e(l. jf eliam])agne or good 
brandy cannot be obtained, very old pure whisky may be used. 
For the first twenty-fi>ni" or i'oi'ty-eight hours the di(>t shoidd l)e 
lif[uid — milk or one of the liijiiids given in the diet-list below. 
Fsually from o to 10 ounces of fi)od will be taken the s<H'ond, 
and from 10 to lo omiees the thii'd dav. On the fourth day, 
if there are no untoward svmptoms and it is deenKnl advisable 
a soft diet may be given. (See list below.) After a week or 
ten days the ordinarv diet may be resinned. 

Nausea and Vomiting. — This is more fre(|uent after 
prolonged op(M'ations and when etluM- has Ix^en the anesthetic! 
used, but can often be ])revented by washing out the stomach 

' C. S. Wliite, Annal< of S>ir(j>'rij, Aut,Mist, 1904. 



THIRST. 6G1 

while the patient is still under the infliicaiee of the anesthetic, 
as has been mentioned. Nausea and vomiting are less frequently 
occasioned by the drop method of producing ether anesthesia than 
by the method of administering large quantities, as was formerly 
])ractised. It may be transitory or may continue for days or 
even a week, depending on the severity of the operation and 
also on personal habit. The management of nausea and vomit- 
ing may become a matter of the greatest difhculty. 

While the vomiting is active no food should be given by the 
mouth. If it persists and the patient is weak, rectal enemata 
may be prescribed unless contraindicated by some special opera- 
tion. These may be given every six or eight hours. (See 
Eectal Feeding.) 

Various methods for the relief of vomiting may be tried. 
A teaspoonful or tw^o of hot Avater, to w^hich has been added a 
drop of dilute hydrocyanic acid or of tincture of capsicum to 
an ounce or two of water, may be eflPectual. Teaspoonful doses 
of iced champagne may be useful, as may also the following : 
Drop doses of creasote in a teaspoonful or two of lime-water ; 
drop doses of spirits of chloroform at frequent intervals ; ten 
or twenty minims of a 2 per cent, solution of cocain ; mor- 
phin in very small doses, or bismuth subnitrate. A must;;rd 
plaster, an ice-bag, or a hot-water bag applied to the epigastrium 
sometimes brings relief. If the bowels have not moved, the 
vomiting may be relieved by an enema. A full glass of hot 
water frequently gives relief, and even if it is rejected it serves 
to wash out the stomach. Abashing out the stomach with a 
weak boric-acid solution is often effective in checking the vom- 
iting when all other methods fail. Total abstinence from food, 
drink, and medicine is the safest way to manage the majority 
of cases. 

Thirst. — This is often a troublesome sym])tom ; in some 
cases it is almost intolerable. Kelly has reported the case of a 
patient who drank about a quart of wat(>r from a hot-water 
bag placed at her feet ; many similar occurrences could be cited. 
Clark reported from Kelly^s wards the use of high enemata of 
saline solution to allay the thirst following operation. About 
a quart of solution is used. The patient mud be fully under the 
ameafhetic or sufficiently large quantities will not be retained. 
" A stiff rectal tube is inserted well up into the sigmoid flexure, 
and the fluid is slowly poured into a glass funnel held three feet 
above the patient^s buttocks.'^ While this is being done the 
patient^s buttocks should be elevated six or eight inches, and 



662 DIETETIC MANAGEMENT OF SURGICAL CASES. 

tlie fluid iillowcd to flow well into the colon. It is very rarely 
expelled. Thirst can be best allayed by practicing continuous 
enteroclysis according to the method advised by Murphy (see 
p. o64). If this cannot be done and the thirst is intolerable, 
the patient may be given small quantities of plain hot water, 
carbonated water, or hot weak tea. The tea is often retained 
when water is rejected. 

Care of the Bowels. — As a rule, by the third day after 
operation, it is desirable that the bowels be evacuated, and to 
this end a ])ill of aloes, belladonna, and strychnin or a dose of 
cascara or licorice powder may be given. Calomel is a favorite 
drag with some operators, one-tenth to one-fourth of a grain 
being given every half-hour or every hour until from one to 
three grains have been given. Tliis may be followed by a lialf- 
glass of citrate of magnesia, a few drams of a saturated solution 
of sulphate of magnesia, or a dose of castor oil. If necessary, 
an enema mav be given. Kelly gives the following formula of 
Dr. C. P. Noble : 

li Magnes. sulpb ,^ij ; 

()\. tere])inth ,^ss; 

Glycerin _^j ; 

Acjua qs. ad. ^iv. 

Sig. — Inject into the bowel. 

Not more than three enemata should be given during the 
entire third day. 

If the patient is doing well and there are no untoward symp- 
toms, and if ordinary efforts do not ])r()duce a movement, no 
alarm need be felt even if there be no evacuiition up to tlie 
sixth day. At about tliis time tliey will often move naturally. 

Dietetic Management of Shock. — ^luch can be done, 
by proper management of the diet before the o])eration, to pre- 
vent shock. AVhat is generally spoken of as the l)uilding-np 
])rocess should be resorted to, es]K'cially when the ])atient is 
verv much debilitated, before every operation that will ])er- 
mit it 

Following the o])eration, in addition to the usual means of 
stinndation, as the a])])licatlon of extci'iial warmth and the like, 
stimulating and nuti'ient enemata may be given, "^riie first 
enema may be administered while the patient is on the table 
and still under the influence of the anesthetic. This may be 
re]ieat(Kl everv three hours, or, if tlic |)atient's condition allows 
it, at longer intervids. Kelly reeonnnends an enema consisting 



ANESTHESIA AND DIET. GG;} 

of two ounces of brandy, twenty grains of carbonate of ammonia, 
witli snllicicnt water or beef-tea at ;57.S^^ i\ (100° F.) to make 
eiglit ounces. A stimulating enema of '2()i) c.c. salt solution and 
200 c.c. of coffee is often useful. Kitlier of the following nutrient 
enemata may be used to advantage (see ilectal Feeding) : 

(1) Onee-o-. 

A little suit. 

Peptonized milk, 2 to 3 ounces (60-90 c.c). 

Brandy, 1 ounce {'M) c.c.j. 

(2) Whites of two eg<^^. 

Peptonized milk, (5 to 7 ounces (180-200 c.c). 

Anesthesia and Diet. — The relation of diet to anesthesia 
is one deserving of study ; as yet too little has been done. 
Hawk has shown that dogs given 3 or 4 grams of carbohydrate 
per kilo of body-weight failed to show any glycosuria after 
ether anesthesia, but the same dogs for ten days on a carbo- 
hydrate-free diet showed glycosuria. The question of post- 
anesthetic glycosuria would seem to be largely a question of 
diet, and the minimum of carbohydrate per kilogram of body- 
weight necessary to prevent glycosuria in the human being 
should be determined. 

Another similar question is that of postanesthetic acidosis. 
We have seen various grades of acidosis, particularly following 
ether. Children who have been starved prior to o})eration would 
seem to be especially liable. As the condition is serious and 
at times even fatal, we w^ould suggest the administration of car- 
bohydrate food the day prior to the operation in the cases where 
this is feasible. Where it has developed, the administration of 
glucose solutions by rectum by the Murphy drop method should 
be tried. Thirty grams (1 ounce) of glucose may be dissolved 
in 1 liter (quart) of normal salt solution or in water may be 
utilized for this purpose. 

In general, the following plan may be adopted with satisflic- 
tory results in all cases where an anesthetic is to be administered 
and circumstances permit it to be carried out. The day pre- 
ceding the operation the patient should keep quiet ; the bowels 
sh(Hild be thoroughly emptied by means of a saline, and the 
diet should be light and easily digestible. The supper should 
be a light one, and nothing but water should be given for six 
hours at least before operation if possible ; but water may be 
given freely up to the time of operation. At the time of ajtes- 
thesia the stomach should he empty ! This has a tendency to 



664 DIETETIC MANAGEMENT OF SUEGICAL CASES. 

lessen tlie nausea that is apt to follow the operation, and pre- 
vents vomiting while the operation is in })rogress. If the 
stomach contains food and vomiting occurs, the vomited material 
may be drawn into the larynx and cause choking or severe 
coughing, or it may be drawn into the lungs and cause pneu- 
monia. Tlie vomiting and coughing mav, besides, interfere 
materially with the progress of the operation. 

If it is necessary to administer an anesthetic after a full meal 
and circumstances permit, an emetic maybe given to empty the 
stomach before operation is l)rgnn, or it ma}' be better to wash 
out the stomach. 

Xausea is apt to follow after anesthesia, particularly after the 
administration of ether; this has been discussed in a previous 
j)aragraph. Food should not be hurried after an operation. A 
patient suffers less from too little food than from too much. If 
nausea does not occur, a cup of weak tea or of diluted milk may 
be given two or three hours after the o])eration, and if that is re- 
tained, milk may be given as often as every three hours if de- 
sired. For supper, bread and milk or cocoa or a slice of toast 
and a cup of tea may l)e allowed. It is well, however, to wait 
until the following day before giving anything more. On the 
following day, if there is no nausea or other untoward symptoms, 
a light breakfast may be given, and after that as rapid a return 
to an ordinary diet as circumstances Avill allow may be made. 

DIET AFTER OPERATION. 

There are many erroneous views concerning the diet suitable 
after operations. These views are held not only by many sur- 
geons of large practice, but by physicians and liospital men as 
welL Fortunately, the day is passing wlien the surgeon con- 
siders his duty done when he remoyes his operating gown. 
'Vhcre are still hos{)itals, however, where much of the after- 
trcatinent of operations is delegated to untrained men, who, 
often fresh from the lecture-room, are uncertain as to what diet 
tlie patient should I'eceive, and therefore leave this entirely to 
the rnn'se. 

The diet following operations should be su])eryise(l by the 
surgeon himself or by an assistant who has been especially 
trained i\fV the purpose. In operations about the mouth, as for 
hareli[), and on tin; alimentary tract, the management of the diet 
is often of as much importance as the operation itself. Hans 
Xelir maintains that the diet is as important a ])art of the 
teclinic after operations as the sterilizing of hands and instru- 



DIET AFTER OPERATION. 665 

raents is before it. On account of the difficulty of maintaining 
a pro])er diet at lionie, owinii; to the interference of well-inten- 
tioned but mipguided friends, he refuses to operate at tlie home 
of the patient except when transportation is out of the f|uestion. 

It should be remembered that confinement to bed for weeks 
after an operation greatly inijuiirs the nutrition, and every effort 
should therefore be made to select operations that reduce the 
period of confmement to bed as much as possible. The patients 
should be allowed to get up as soon as practicable, if only to sit 
in a wheel-chair, and so make airing more easv. jNIanv ingen- 
ious devices have been invented for maintaining comfortable 
positions and at the same time permitting the patient to be 
moved about. In some cases massage and electricity mav l)e 
employed, and whenever it is possible the patient should be in 
the fresh air a part of the time. Wherever feasible the bed 
may be rolled to a sun parlor or to a porch to supply the neces- 
sary light and air. When this is done marked improvement in 
the nutrition of the patient follows. 

In patients who are up and about no especial diet is, as a 
rule, necessary, except after operations on the mouth, larynx, or 
alimentary tract (see p. 667). The diet should be as simple and 
nutritious as possible — usually that of the ordinary individual. 
Diabetics do best on the diet advised for diabetes, and on such 
a diet healing may be facilitated, whereas on an ordinary diet 
it may progress but slowly or not at all. Gouty and dyspeptic 
patients should receive especial attention, as has been directed 
in a previous section. Vegetarians should gradually be returned 
to a mixed diet — indeed, a few weeks' stay in a hospital may 
serve to cure them from the folly of pursuing such a diet. 
Children should be fed as directed in the section on the Feeding 
of Infants and Children, and in all cases, where the condition 
permits, the child should be accustomed to the diet of the hos- 
pital before the o})eration, or the results of ini])roper feeding 
may be wrongly attributed to the operation and much harm 
result. 

In all cases the individual should be carefully studied as 
regards his habits and nutrition. It is surprising to see how 
the condition improves and the appetite returns after pus has 
been evacuated. 

Those habituated to the daily use of alcohol for years should 
receive a moderate average amount, lest nutrition be interfered 
with or delirium develop. The amount should be the minimum 
required to secure results, but should not be so low as to defeat 
the purpose for whicli it is given. 



666 DIETETIC MANAGEMENT OF SURGICAL CASES. 



Diet after Operations about the Head. — Following 
all injuries or operations alx)ut the head the diet should be 
earefully regulated. For the first lew days the diet sliould be 
liglit if the ])rain has been affected — usually li(|uid — and as 
nutritious and as easy of digestion as it is possi})le to make it. 

The bowels should be ke])! open. Xo alcohol should be 
allowed except in the case of habitues, and these should receive 
the minimum amount based on their previous daily average. 
If the patient is unconscious or unable to swallow, he should 
})e fed with the nasal or stomach-tube or rectal feeding may be 
instituted. 

After l)rain operations, when there are no unusual symptoms, 
the diet should be liquid for the first two or three days and 
then a semisolid or even an easily dio^estible solid diet may be 
allowed. Milk-toast, junket, bouillon and eo^g, soft-boiled or 
]X)ached ogg^, squab, chicken, and the like are allowable. The 
diet should be light but sufficient in quantity until the patient 
is up and about, when the amount may be increased until a 
nearly normal diet is taken. 

In operations of a plastic nature about the face, where the 
taking of food or vomiting is apt to open the wound, the food 
should be given by the rectum until all danger of vomiting is 
past and until the patient can masticate or swallow without 
fear of injuring the part. It should be remembered that 
wounds about the mouth are often very easily pulled apart. 

Diet after Harelip or Cleft-palate Operations. — Fol- 
lowing these operations especial attention to the diet is necessary. 
The cliild should be sent to the hospital several days or even 
wec^ks before the operation, in order to accustom him to the 
attendants, to the hospital feeding, and to teach him to take 
nourishment from a sj)oon or by means oi' a long medicine- 
drop])er. If the })atient is an infmt, it should receive the diet 
on which it is increasing in weight, li' breast milk is to be 
given, it should be tak<'n from the breast with a breast-pump 
and fed to the infant with a spoon. The greatest ck'anliness 
should be observed, and the tcchnic of j)re})aring and ])reserving 
the milk -hoiild l)e carefully cai-ried out. The infant should 
not be allowed to suck too >oon, for iear of breaking open the 
Nvound. 

In all mouth opcM'ations the diet should consist of cold 
stci'ilized milk oi' modifications of milk until solid food can be 
tak<ii. Ivcctal feeding oi" feecling by means of a nasal tube 
may l)e used as a tem|)orary expedieiil. 



DIET AFTER OPERATIONS ABOUT THE PANCREAS. 6G7 

Diet after Bsophageal Operations. — Following esoph- 
agotoiny rectal feeding may be employed, or tlic; patient may 
be fed with a nasal or a stomaeli-tnbe nntil he is able to swallow 
without pain. The f )od should l)e of li(juid or semisolid con- 
sistence nntil the wound has healed, except when the patient 
may be trusted to masticate all food very thoroughly. If the 
food is regurgitated through the wound or if it })asses out on 
swallowing, the feeding had better be accom])lished by means 
of a tube, or rectal feeding may be instituted ibr several days. 

Diet after Bxcision of the I/arynx. — The diet after 
this operation is a matter of great imj^ortance. Formerly great 
difficulties were encountered, and gastrotomy was often resorted 
to as a means of furnishing food to the patient. Witii im- 
provement in technic this may now usually be dispensed with. 
(The student is referred to the text-books on surgery lor an 
account of the improved technic.) 

The length of time that must be allowed to elapse after the 
operation before the patient can be permitted to swallow is de- 
pendent upon the ]iatient's condition. Graf operated upon a 
patient wdio w^as able to swallow on the day following the opera- 
tion. The length of time varies ordinarily from four days to 
eight weeks or longer. During this time rectal feeding may be 
employed at the outset, or the nasal or the stomach-tube may 
be used. Some operators insert a tube in the esophagus and 
allow it to remain there for days. It may be passed through 
the mouth or the nose. This method has been strongly con- 
demned and is not in general use. 

Diet after Operations about the Gall-bladder or 
I/iver. — Following operations upon the gall-bladder, Avhere a 
fistula has been made, the food should consist largely of the 
proteins and carbohydrates. The fats are not well borne, and 
for this reason it is w^ell to eliminate them so far as possible 
from the dietary. Water is the first thing of importance and 
should be forced. It has been demonstrated that if a i)atient 
suffering with gall-bladder disease does not void at least 500 c.c. 
of urine in twenty-four hours mental symptoms are almost cer- 
tain to develop. 

Diet after Operations about the Pancreas. — The 
functions of the pancreas, with the exception of furnishing a 
fat-splitting enzyme, can be assumed and carried on by the 
other glands. The diet does not differ from that advised for 
other abdominal operations, but it may be well to limit the 
consumption of fats. The use of artificially pancreatized food 



668 DIETETIC MAXAGEMENT OF SURGICAL CASES. 

has been suggested. This is a subject that requires further 
investigation. 

Diet after Operations about the Kidney. — In all 

operations about the kidney the diet should be so arranged as 
to make the work of elimination as easy as possible for the 
organ. This may be accomplished by a diet such as has been 
prescribed in chronic or even in acute uephritis. All irritating 
substances, in ]iarticular, should be avoided. 

Diet after Operations on the Stomach. — In pre- 
paring patients for operations on the stomach the fact that 
such individuals are often emaciated and weakened by long- 
continued illness must constantly be borne in mind ; on this 
account such patients should, wherever ])ossib]e, be '^ built ud'^ 
for at least a week before operation. In order to accomplish 
this result as much digestible food as tlie ])atient can consume 
should be given him. It should be offered to him in as appe- 
tizing and in as concentrated a form as possible ; as a rule, only 
small quantities at frequent intervals should be given. 

If necessary, rectal alimentation should be practised ; in indi- 
viduals who are anemic and very weak, the use of a salt infu- 
sion the day previous to the operation is advisable. In all 
operations on the stomach it is most inqiortant that the organ 
1)6 as sterile as possible, and also entirely empty before the 
o])eration. Since the noteworthy experiments of Gushing and 
Livingood,^ by which these investigators established the fact that 
an amicrobic state can be produced in the stomach and small 
intestine, Finney, as well as other surgeons, has taken advan- 
tage of this fact in his surgical procedures on the stomach. 

I>y washing out the stomach thoroughly with sterile water 
twic'C daily and feeding the patient()n a sterile diet tlie stomach 
may be kept free from micro-organisms. Finney advises the 
following procedure : 

" For three to ibur days ])re(teding the operation the ])atient 
is i\'i\ on sterile li(juid ibod at intervals of two hours. The lood 
is served in sterile dishes. Always before taking nourishment 
i\\v. mouth is thoroughly clejuiscd with a 1 ])er cent, solution oi' 
carholic acid. The st(tmach is washed twice daily with sterile 
water and always two !ionr> before operation, and nothing injected 
after lhi<. 

'' l'^)r two days after the o])eration nourishment is adminis- 
tered only by means ol' I'eetal alimentation. Xorinal salt solu- 
tion enemata an; alternated with nutrient enemata at intervals

of every four hours, or continuous feedino^ ])y tlie drop method 
maybe practised; on the third day after operation eo^i^-albumen 
is given in teas})oonful doses, gradually increased to one-half 
ounce every two hours, if well borne, and iinally to one ounce 
every two hours on the fourth day, and two ounces on the fifth 
day. On the eighth day any liquid is ])ermissible, and on the 
eleventh day the ])atient is given a soft-boiled v<^!^ ; on the 
thirteenth, a soft diet ; on the fifteenth, very restricted light diet ; 
on tlu^ sixteenth, a restricted light diet ; and on the eighteenth, 
very light solid food."

Surgeons differ markedly in their views regarding the time that 
should be allowed to elapse after o[)erati()ns on the stomach 
before mouth-feeding is begun. Some, as Czerny, allow eight 
days to elapse, whereas others, as von Eiselsberg, give very 
light food, such as milk, the day following the operation. 
According to Kehr,^ the following regidations as to diet should 
be maintained after operations on the stomach : 

" 1. After operation, the diet shoidd be regulated at first 
from hour to hour, then from day to day. 

" 2. Strono^, healthv individuals mav be allowed to ^o with- 
out food as long as their general condition ^varrants it. 

^^ 3. The more extensive the operation, the more care should 
be exercised with the diet. 

^' 4. Patients weakened by cancerous growths may be allowed 
liquid food as soon as the etfect of the anesthetic has worn off.

670 DIETETIC MANAGEMENT OF SURGICAL CASES. 

" 5. An exact knowledge of the motor as well as the secre- 
tory functions of the stomach will indicate the proper method 
of feeding in these cases. '^ 

Diet after Operations on the Intestine. — In opera- 
tions on the npper portion of the intestine the dietetic regula- 
tions are similar to those previously described under Operations 
on the Stomach ; food may^ however, be given by the mouth 
earlier than after operations on the stomach. Tlie food should 
be of such a nature as will not leave too solid a residue in the 
bowels ; it must also vary according to the pathologic condition 
present, as well as according to the extent of the surgical pro- 
cedure. 

After an ordinary appendix operation the patient may be 
given licpiid food on the second day after o])eralion ; on the 
third day a soft diet may be allowed, and on the fifth or sixth 
day solid food may be taken ; on tiie other hand, if the opera- 
tion has been a serious one, with pus-formation and a gan- 
grenous appendix, he may be required to be fed exclusively by 
rectal eneniata for five or six days or more. 

The cause of death after gastric and intestinal operations, 
according to F. Ehrlich,^ is not so much shock as exhaustion, 
brought on by starvation before and after tlie operation. To 
prevent this he feeds his patients immediately after the ether 
nausea has worn off, and he feeds them well. 

He feeds his patients by a routine method in the foHowing 
manner : So soon as the nausea from the anesthetic has worn 
off, the patient gets tea, red wine or gruel ; on tlie day after the 
operation he is given sweetbread in bouillon, even if it nauseates 
him ; if the nausea is ]iersistent his stomach is washed. On 
the second day, finely (!liop})ed, c(^)oked scpiab, chicken or veal 
is added ; on the third day, beef, ])()tato ])uree, and cakes ; on 
the f)urtli, ch()p])ed ham (raw), soft zwieback, and soft-l)oiled 
eggs ; on the fifth day, white bread and spinacli. After tlie 
seventh day the meat is not chopped and then the jxitient 
returns gradually to normal diet. The bowels are regulated 
with oil enemas. The shock of the operation does not usually 
last beyond the third day. 

After operations on the rectum the patient is kej^t on a fluid 
diet for from four to five days; after this a soft diet is given, 
and finally, in six or seven days, solid food may be })rescril)('d. 

Feeding through Gastric or Intestinal Fistulas. — 
After gastric or intestinal fistulas have been made, the patient 

^ Munchener Mcdicinische Worhcm^chrift, 1904, ii., 61-4, No. 14. 



DIET IN PANCREATIC FISTULA. 671 

may, if neccs.saiy, be fed tliroiigli these openings us early as 
a few hours after the operation. It is best at first to give 
only very small quantities of licpiicls at freipient intervals. 
Kehr advises alternately, every two hours, one-half cuj) of tea 
with cognac, milk, and {})rg^ and, on the second day, wine with 
peptone. He adds bouillon with an egg on the third day, and 
begins with '' mushy " food, such as potato soup, Hour souj)s 
with idgg, beef-tea with mhiced breast of chicken on the eighth 
day. After three weeks the patient may be allowed to masti- 
cate his food, and then, by means (jf a rubber tube, pass it into 
the stomach through the fistula. 

Diet in Pancreatic Fistula. — Heineke has pointed out 
that in persistent fistula following operation on the pancreas, 
where there is maceration of the skin due to the action of the 
pancreatic secretion, Wolilgemuth's method of dieting gives sat- 
isfactory results. AYohlgemuth found that the amount of fluid 
discharged from the pancreas depended on the composition of 
the food taken by the patient. AVith fatty diet the secretion was 
very scantv, and with an albuminous diet it increased on the 
addition of carbohydrates and became very abundant. Secre- 
tion is increased by acids and diminished by alkalis. Bicarbo- 
nate of soda in small, frequently repeated doses is perhaps the 
best method of administering alkalis in these cases. 



ARMY AND NAVY RATIONS. 
ARMY RATIONS. 

By the term " ration " is meant the sum-total of the daily 
allowance of food issued by a government to its soldiers and 
sailors. Candles and soaj) also form ])art of the ration. Com- 
])utation of the quantities of the various component parts of 
the ration is greatly facilitated l^y the use of the "Army Kation 
Issue and Conversion Tables/' which show, almost at a glance, 
the amounts required for any number of rations from 1 to 50,000. 

The subject of army rations has received careful study. The 
subjoined tables, taken for the most ])art from articles on army 
diet by Major Charles E. Woodruif, of the United States Army, 
give a summary of the rations furnished the various armies of 
the world. 

The ration in times of peace is easily arranged. AVhether or 
not the soldier is well fed will depend largely on the commander 
and tlie cook of the company. Each soldier is required to do 
his own cooking, except in garrisons, when certain men are 
detailed for that duty. If the cook is energetic and skilful, he 
will be al)le so to arrange the diet as to give the men sufficient 
variety ; if, in addition to the regular ration, there are a kitchen- 
garden at the army post and a well managed '^ savings fund," 
the company should live very well indeed. On the other hand, 
if the cook is unskilful or lazy, and if there is neithei' kitchen- 
garden nor savings fund to draw u})on, the company will receive 
a monotonous or even an injurious diet. The "savings fund" 
is made up of the money obtained fj-om tlie snle of unused 
rations. That part of the ration which is not utilized is i-esold 
to the commissary, and the money so obtained is cxj^'uded by 
tlie comm.ander of the compnny for table luxuries. The fund 
is augmented bv the ])rofits of the " Post Exchange," which is 
a s(irt of general store where tobacco, lunches, and the like ai<' 
sold. The amount and variety of foo<] supplied are set forth 
in the following tables/ com})iled by A\'o(Mlruff from observa- 
tions made by him at Fort Assiniboine, Montana :

intended for troops beyond the advance depots ; the travel 
ration is for troops traveling otherwise than by marching, and 
separated from cooking facilities ; the Filipino ration, for the 
use of Philippine scouts ; and the emergency ration, for troops 
in active campaign, for use on occasions of emergency or in the 
field for purposes of instruction. 

The commanding officer will determine which of the several 
prescribed rations is appropriate for the particular service to be 
performed, and will direct the use of the same. 

When in the exigencies of the service troops are subsisted on 
the haversack ration, and it is found to be practicable to sup- 
plement these stores by local purchase or by shipments, the 
commanding general may direct, in written orders, the issue in 
kind, in addition to the haversack ration, of such available 
articles of food not in excess of the amounts allowed of corre- 
sponding articles in the garrison ration. 

The United States is the only nation that furnishes the entire 
ration to the soldiers. The following tables were taken from 
the general orders. No. 60, of the United States War Depart- 
ment, issued May 8, 1911. There are very slight changes

" Scout organizations will be required to use the entire allow-

ounces of beans per ration in substitution of the portion of the 
rice ration not drawn will be made, and use of as large an extent 
as possible of native products, such as camotes, mangoes, and 
squash, will be rccjuired.'^ 

Concerning the selection of a ration Woodruff says: ''An 
army must be fed at a great distance from the market, and it is 



678 ARMY AND NAVY RATIONS. 

therefore evident the chief objects in view in the selection of 
the soldier's fo(xl must be facility of transportation and ease of 
preservation in all climates. Articles that are bulky or easily 
damaged by rough handling, and those that are not easily pre- 
served from decay, are at once ruled out. It need scarcely be 
mentioned that the articles must be pnxluced in abundance 
throughout the country, neither imported nor the particular 
preparations of a few manufacturers. Couple with this the 
fact that the articles must be so inexpen>ive as to refute any 
charges of extravagance, and it will be readily understood that 
with a few exceptions the ration contains about all the articles 
that it is possible to put in at present without calling on foods 
that are preserved, canned, or otherwise specially pre])ared." 

For the reasons just stat(xl Woodruff says that the soldier's 
ration has always been simple and dry. There was but little 
change in the army ration until recent years. In arranging 
the ration for an army there are a number of matters that 
require careful consideration. An army in a cold climate 
can not thrive on the same diet that an army iu the trojMcs 
would do well on, and vice vprnd. In a cold climate any article 
that will be spoiled by freezing must be eliminated from the 
dietary. This excludes potatoes, fresh vegetables, canned goods 
that are in fluid form, and the like. 

The subject of diet for soldiers in the tropics is one of great 
interest. Food that excessive heat will spoil or that can not 
easily be preserved by ignorant men must be avoided. The 
ration should be so arranged that it may readily be changed to 
suit the climate. It has been abundantly proved by our army 
in the Philippines that men living quiet lives in the tropics eat 
less than they would in a cold or temperate climate. This dif- 
ference is j)articularly marked in the consumption of meat and 
fatty substances. If, however, an army is undergoiug very 
active service with excessive labor and resulting fatigue, the 
meat allowance will have to be correspondingly increased to 
make up for the wear and tear of the muscular system. Major 
Kean is quoted as follows in the report of the Surgeon-General 
of the United St^ites Army, HM)0, p. 201 : 

"He premises that a tropical dietary, as comj)ared with one 
suited to a colder climate, should have h'ss fat and more carbo- 
hydrates, less stimulating proteins in the form of meat, a greater 
variety of diet both of me^ts and of carbohydrates in the form 
of fresh vegetables and fruib^, and, lastly, a fairly liberal su{)[)ly

of ice. His argument for the suhstitiition of carbohydrates for 
fats is that the digestion is weakened in hot climates and the 
liver is inclined to torpidity, while ingested fats are prone to 
split up into butyric, caproic, and other irritating acids, whi<;h 
the diminished secretion of the liver is unable to neutralize. 
As intestinal digestion cannot proceed in the presence of 
acidity, the condition known as biliousness is established, with 
putrefaction of the intestinal contents and tlui production of 
various harmful alkaloid substances. A catarrhal intlannnation 
of the bowel results, with diarrhea, which is at tirst of advan- 
tage in eliminating the harmful substances, but which under 
the continued irritation of unsuitable diet is liable to continue 
and become aggravated. As to a lessened use of meat, he cites 
the dietary customs of the inhabitants of hot (;limates, who get 
their proteins less from meat than from the leguminosa). The 
appetite is lessened by long and continued heat and becomes 
capricious. It craves variety, esj^ecially in vegetables and 
fruits, and these he claims cannot be had on the basis of our 
present ration. The need of ice to furnish a cool drinking- 
water and to preserve the perishable constituents of the ration 
is regarded as obvious." 

An admirable essay on ^^ The Ideal Ration f)r an Army in 
the Tropics," by Ca])tain Edward L. Munson, ap})eared in the 
Bo>ifon Medical and SxrcfiraJ Journal for May, 1900. Munson 
thinks that the present ration is very well chosen as to its 
nutrient properties, but that it should be rearranged for use in 
the tropics, and he suggests the following tables for tropical 
dietaries :

It will be observed that Avhile these four dietaries differ con- 
siderably from one another, yet when averaged togetlier in equal 
proportions they do not vary greatly from the nutritive standard 
for the tropics already proposed — and this is an additional rea- 
son why the same articles of diet should not be selected from 
day to day. It is seen that the foregoing average dietary, as com- 
pared with the proposed nutrient standard, is still slightly de- 
ficient in fats and fuel-value and a trifle in excess as regards 
protein. These discrepancies, however, if they may be consid- 
ered as such, are readily overcome by using Dietary II. tAvice, 
whereas Dietaries I., III., and lY. are each employed but once.

Another point to be remembered is that if the cluuige in diet 
is made gradually, men can be accustomed to live on almost 
any food, whereas rapid changes in the diet are not well borne 
and are apt to be followed by illness. 

The army ration should not be planned with a view to keep- 
ing a soldier on the smallest possible amount of food at the 
least possible expenditure of money. His diet should be such 
as will maintain liim in the best physical condition, regardless 



682 ARMY AND NAVY RATIONS. 

of the varied circumstances under which he may be compelled 
to live. There is no economy in underfeeding soldiers. In all 
wars the number of sick and of those dead from disease due to 
improper food is larirer than that due to the enemy's bullets. 

Many theories and opinions regardinir wliat constitutes the 
best food for a soldier have been advanced. On one point, 
however, all are agreed, and that is that the diet should be 
varied and should be so arranged as to allow of substitution of 
various articles, so that the ration may be varied to suit the 
changing conditions. This variation should be made by the 
commander, on the spot where the army is located, and not by 
some one unacquainted with the exact surroundings and needs 
of the men. Owing to the carelessness or ignorance of com- 
manders, a monotonous, disease-producing fare is often fur- 
nished, when the food might easily be varied and rendered 
suitable. A well-selected dietary presupposes a competent com- 
manding officer. 

The dryness and sameness of the food of soldiers doubtless are 
responsible for much of the drunkenness that occurs among them. 

When the troops are in permanent camj), within reach of 
markets, and when the facilities for cooking have been properly 
arranged, practically the same ration as is supplied in tlie gar- 
rison may be used. When at a distance from the base of sup- 
plies and with no available market, the food must be of such a 
nature as to allow it to be easily transported in the supply 
wagons. When on the march, the diet is essentially the same 
as when at a distance from the base of supplies. If possible, 
food may be })urchased on the way from the company's fund, 
but if the march is through a wilderness, either pork or bacon 
must be used. On account of its ease of preparation, bacon is 
usually chosen. Captain Spurgin, quoted by Woodruff', gives 
the following method of using })ork on the march, a method 
whose practicability was tested by him in the Indian campaign, 
when he followed the enemy for hundreds of miles : ^'As soon 
a.s camp was made, a fire was started and the pork was thor- 
oughly boiled. This was j)ut away to cool and was used the 
next day. At the same time some soup stock which was carried 
along wa.s made into soup for dinner. Whenever it was con- 
venient and bones could be secured, enough soup stock was 
made by prolonged boiling to last several days, l^eans were 
prepared by c<joking them overnight." Hard bread and coffee 
are also used, and prepared chocolate and dried fruit have like-

wise been recommended. Experiments have been made with 
various materials for emergency rations, amonf»' them bein^^ 
dried meat of various kinds, and grain mixtures that coul(] be 
eaten with or without cooking. 

Various prepared foods are also used. In the German Army 
^'Krbwurst" is highly esteemed. This is a mixture of pea- 
meal, fat, bacon, herbs, onions, (^tc, put up in the form of small 
sausages. It is manufactured in the (i(^v('rnment factories, the 
sei^ret for making it having })een purchased by the German 
Government from the inventor for $25, ()()<). If used t^jo con- 
tinuously, it is liable to produce flatulence and diarrhea, and a 
strong dislike for it is engendered. Its chief value lies in the 
fact that it is lighter and more easily transported than most 
any other form of food, and that it is easily pre[)ared for use. 
English soldiers object to it on account of its seasoning, but 
employ similar preparations of pea soup.

In addition to the foregoing, either tea or coffee must be sup- 
})lied. It must be borne in mind that the emergency rations 
are to be used only when necessary, and that they are not to be 
relied upon for any length of time. They may contain the 
proper proportions of protein, etc., but they are dried foods, 
and their bulk is too small. It is impossible to compress sufH- 
cient food into a small compass, and consequently condensed 
foods of any kind are of little value. 

xVt the present day, the preservation of food has reached a 
degree of })erfection when almost every variety of food can be 
preserved for use. Where transportation facilities permit, these 
may be u.<ed, but they are bulky and do not withstand the 
extremes of climate nor rouoh handlinii-.

RATIONS OF FOREIGN ARMIES. 

The student is referred to the article by Major Woodruff in 
the Medical Record, May 1899, page 701, from which the 
accompanying table is taken. 

There are so many factors to be fciken into con.sideration that 
it will be impossible to analyze here the rations supplied the 
different armies. Americans, on account of the hiofher plane 
of activity on which they live, require the stimulating effects 
of an abundance of fresh meat. In Europe fresh meat is 
expensive, and for this reason the nitrogen is largely supplied 
in the form of peas, beans, clieose, etc. In the Russian ration 
the percentage of me^it is somewhat low, but the deficiency is 
made up by bread. 

As stated elsewhere, the United States is the only govern- 
ment that furnislies the entire ration. Other nations sup})ly part 
in food, the remainder being purchased by the soldier out of 
his pay or out of an allowance made him. These methods are 
siiitable in thickly populated countries, but cannot be em])loyed 
for soldiers on the frontier. Foreign soldiers, esj^ecially Ger- 
mans, receive boxes from home to ])iece out the ration, and the 
purchasing power of money for o.xtras is greater in Europe 
than on our frontier. The Austrian ration, wliic^h is greatly 
increased for field duty, is said to be the most liberal in the 
world. The Italian ration, con.-idcring the cliinalc, is lil)eral,

armies, and in France this may be replaced by an allowance of 
cognac. The American soldier formerly could buy reasonable 
quantities of beer at the army canteen. The al)olishment of 
the canteen has increased drunkenness in our army. 

REMARKS. 



No. 1 : This is starvation diet, and the extra food needed for 
health is purchased and charged against the soldier (about six 
cents a day), increasing, perhaps doubling, the food value. 



686 ARMY AND NAVY RATIONS. 

No. 2 : Can be greatly changed to suit climate. 

No. 3 : Sufficient for such a mild climate and very moderate 
work. 

No. 4 : Varies enormously according to class of rations 
issued. Very many extra allowances of money for food. 

No. 5 : This is augmented by four cents a day for vegetables, 
et<;. On the march a limited emergency ration is used. The 
war ration is so insufficient that commanders of armies or 
smaller forces may change, supplement, or even double it. 

No. 6 : Allowances of one-fifth of a cent a day for condi- 
ments ; occasional extra money allowances for food. Excepting 
the protein, it is a very liberal diet for so mild a country. 

No. 7 : This is what the government may supply. Usually 
the soldier feeds himself and is given seven cents a day or more 
to reimburse him for the outlay. The food eaten is more than 
this deficient diet allows. 

No. 8 : Maxima due to fats if all the bacon is used and no 
meat. The entire ration is supplied and intended to be eaten. 

No. 9 : Peace ration not stated. It is purchased as needed 
and charged against the soldier. AVar ration is subject to great 
augmentation for increased work or cold climate. The com- 
manding officer may augment ration on the march. 

No. 10 : Also allowed money to buy one-half to one and one- 
half ounces extra meat, and one to one and one-half cents for 
vegetables, salt, butter, lard, and groceries. 

No. 11 : Extra meat and spirits may be ordered by the 
commander-in-chief. 

NAVY RATIONS. 

It was a notorious fact that in former days the monotonous 
and '' dead '^ character of the food on board ship led to nutri- 
tion disorders, especially scurvy, and in recent times hard tack 
and salt meat have been utilized to a large extent. Never 
before in the history of tlie navy lias as much attention been 
paid to the selection, preparation, and serving of food. In 
place of the poorly prepared, monotonous diet of former days 
the sailor is served with tlie following ration : 

'^ Naval Act, June 29, 1 900.— Pror/r/rr/, That sections fifteen 
hundred and eighty and fifteen hundred and eighty-one, He- 
vised Statutes, be amended to read as follows : 

''Sec. loH(l. — The Navy ration shall consist of the follow- 
ing daily allowance of provisions to each person : One pound 



NAVY RATION. 687 

and a quarter of salt or smoked meat, with three ounces of 
dried or six ounces of canned or })reserved fruit, and tliree gills 
of beans or pease, or twelve ounces of Hour; or one ])ound of 
preserved meat, with three ounces of dried or six ounces of 
canned or preserved fruit and ei^^ht ounces of rice or twelve 
ounces of canned veo^etables, or six ounces of desiccated vege- 
tables ; together with one j)oun(l ol' biscuit, two ounces of butter, 
four ounces of sugar, two ounces of coifee or cocoa, or one-half 
ounce of tea and one ounce of condenscHl milk or eva])orated 
cream ; and a w^eekly allowauce of one-(juarter ])ound of maca- 
roni, four ounces of cheese, four ounces of tomatoes, oue-half 
pint of vinegar or sauce, one-quarter piut of pickles, one- 
quarter pint of molasses, four ounces of salt, one-half ounce of 
pepper, one-eighth ounce of spices, and one-half ounce of dry 
mustard. Seven pounds of lard, or a suitable substitute, shall 
be alloAved for every hundred pounds of flour issued as bread, 
and such quantities of yeast and flavoring extracts as may be 
necessary. 

^'Sec. 1581. — The following substitution for tlu^ components 
of the ration may be made when deemed necessary by the senior 
officer present in command : ' For one and one-quarter pounds 
of salt or smoked meat or one pound of })reserved meat, one 
and three-quarter pounds of fresh meat or fresh fish, or eight 
eggs ; in lieu of the articles usually issued with salt, smoked or 
preserved meat, one and three-quarter pounds of fresh vege- 
tables ; for one ])ound of biscuit, one and one-quarter pounds 
of soft bread or eighteen ounces of flour ; for three gills of 
beans or pease, twelve ounces of flour or eight ounces of rice or 
other starch food, or twelve ounces of canned vegetables; for 
one ])ound of condensed milk or evaporated cream, one quart 
of fresh milk ; for three ounces of dried or six ounces of canned 
or preserved fruit, nine ounces of fresh fruit ; and for twelve 
ounces of flour or eight ounces of rice or other starch food, or 
twelve ounces of canned vegetables, three gills of l)eans or pease ; 
in lieu of the weekly allowance of one-(juarter pound of maca- 
roni, four ounces of cheese, one-half pint of vinegar or sauce, 
one-quarter pint of pickles, one-quarter pint of molasses, and 
one-eighth ounce of s})ices, three pounds of sugar, or one and a 
half pounds of condensed milk, or one pound of coffee, or one 
and a half pounds of canned fruit, or four jiounds of fresh 
vegetables, or f )ur pounds of Hour. 

"^An extra allowance of one ounce of ci^ffee or cocoa, two 
ounces of sugar, four ounces of hard bread or its equivalent, 



688 AEMY AND NAVY RATIONS. 

and four ounces of preserved meat or its equivalent shall be 
allowed to enlisted men of the engineer and dynamo force who 
stand night watches between eight o'clock postmeridian and 
eight o'clock antemeridian, under steam.' " 

"Naval Act, March 2, 1907. — Any article comprised in the 
navy ration may be issued in excess of the authorized quantity, 
provided there be an underissue of the same value in some 
other article or articles." 

The above ration is not so much an expression of what the 
sailor should have, as what he wants. 

As Gate wood aptly remarks, " Contentment in naval service 
in relation to food and water makes for good discipline, and 
contentment without work is impossible. . . . Contentment 
facilitates voluntary enlistment, and a service that supplied 
protein food in amounts exactly to meet the requirements of the 
body as evolved from the mathematics of nitrogenous equilib- 
rium would not secure contentment. That is the basis of the 
daily amounts of food in the navy ration, the amounts depend- 
ing essentially not upon what it is thought men ought to 
eat, but upon what experience has demonstrated they desire 
to eat." 

The navy ration must be viewed from the very practical 
point of giving efficient service, and it should be sufficiently 
elastic to vary with the tastes of the men and to life under the 
varying conditions under which the sailor lives. The diet in the 
tropics will differ from that in the cooler regions just as the 
appetite and metabolism vary with the changing temperature, 
degrees of light, and humidity. It is not very well understood 
at present, but it is quite probable that the surface nerves react 
to external influences, and thus affect the metabolism to a great 
extent. 

Selection of food is of great importance, and much can be 
done by having a variety of different preserved and canned 
meats, fruits, and vegetables. 

The nutritive value of navy rations is difficult to compare, as 
it must take into account whether it refers to the entire ration 
as issued or as it is consumed, or as it may be mf)dified by way 
of commutation. Exact information is difficult to obtain, })ut a 
com])arison of our ration with that of other nations has been 
made as correctly as possible, with the limitations indicated })v

lowinir laMc :

The figures in the above table relatino^ to the French Navv 
should be accepted with not a little reservation, as in the data 
obtainable it is not clear that all necessary factors have been 
included or that any allowance for waste is made. It is prob- 
able that the ration is given as issued and not as consumed. 
In regard to the Japanese Navy, it may be noted that the 
average weight of the enlisted man seems to be about 129 
pounds. 

It may be considered that the average man in the United 
States Navy consumes daily 142 grams of protein, 193 grams 
of fat, and 492 grams of carbohydrates with a fuel value of 
4256 calories. The engineer forces are given an additional ra- 
tion as issiied of 42 grams of protein, 27 of fat, and 139 of 
carbohydrate, which makes the engineer force receive more 
protein than is given in Atwater's Standards for a man at very 
hard muscular labor. 

The navy ration must be studied from several points of view, 
viz., its acceptability to the people who are to consume it, and 
this, perhaps, for reasons stated above, comes first ; its avail- 
ability and its keeping qualities and its storage, besides the all- 
important question of securing the proper amount of nutriment 
within a fixed daily cost per person. All of these and other 
questions are considered in an excellent article by J. D. Gate- 
wood in his work on Xaval Hygiene, to which the reader de- 
siring more extended information is referred.

690 AEMY AND SAVY RATIONS. 

Tlic following regulations, taken from the General Jless 
Manual and Cook Book for Um on Board Vessek of the United 
States Navy, 1902, gives many interesting facts concerning the 
organization and management of the mess : 

PART I —THE GENERAL MESS. 

Organization and Administration.— 1. The general messing system is, 
by the i-egiilations, obligatory on Ix^ard of all vessels of the navy. The mess 
must include all enlisted men of the navy and marine corps, excei)ting chief 
petty officers and officei's' servants, and its members ai-e to be divided into 
messes of about twenty men each, and as nearly as pf)ssible messed by divisions 
instead of by ratings, as has heretofore been the custom. By this liiethod the 
petty officers will be scattered among the messes and there can be no complaint 
on account of discrimination — all faring alike. 

2. A messman is to be detailed for each mess, and he is to receive the food 
fi-om the cooks at the galley, serve it at the mess table, and is responsible for 
the care and the cleanliness of the mess gear and mess tables. 

?). The chief commissary steward, or commissary steward, the cooks and 
bakers, together with the storekeeper (when a store is established on the ship), 
form the enlisted force of the commissary de])artment. They are the assist- 
ants of the pay officer and belong to the pay division. 

4. The responsibility of the commissary and his assistant ceases with the 
delivery of the food to the messmen at the galley. 

0. The established rate of pay being sufficient to secure the services of com- 
petent and experienced men, the payment of any gratuity, either by the com- 
missary or by the men themselves, to any person employed in the service of 
the general mess is forbidden by the regulations. 

6. The commanding officer should see that proper facilities, including such 
boats and men as may be necessary, are atiorded the commissary for getting 
mess stores on board and stowing them. 

7. It should be thoroughly understood that the general mess is not an 
organization managed by its members, as was the " berth-deck mess." 

8. In addition to the pay provided for enlisted men, the Government under- 
takes to sul>sist them, and this it does at whatever expense may be necessary. 
The fixed value of comnnitation for one ration is, by law, 80 cents, but the 
(•(immutation of rations is a privilege, not a right, and the idea prevalent 
among enlisted men that they are entitled to receive just 80 cents' worth of 
food eac'h day, or 80 cents in i7ioney, is erroneous. 

9. Under the general messing system tlie (lovernment subsists the men 
entirely, and they have no more voice in the management of the commissary 
de{)artment than in any other department of the ship. The (iovernment, 
through its authorized officer, provides them with the I'ation allowed by law. 
The food is ])urchased, cooked, and served entirely at the Oovernment expense, 
and its value, whether it be more or less than 80 cents })er diem per man, is a 
matter with which the men themselves have nothing to do. 

10. In case any man considei-s that he is im})roj)erly sul)sistcd, he has the 
riglit, which all persons in the navy have, to slate his grievance at the proper 
time and place to his conunanding officer, who should then cause the conunis- 
sarv to investigate the matter, and, if the comjjlaint is well founded, to take 
steps to place the responsibility and to prevent a recurrence of the fault com- 
plainetl of. 

11. The men are entitled to the full benefit of the money and stores allowed 
for their subsistence, and no ex[)enditure can be made from the general mess 
fund except for the benefit of tlie mess; nor can any of this money, or these 
stores, be withheld (when they can be used to advantage) and allowed to 



NAVY EATrONS. 691 

accumulate as a surplus. In cases, lutwever, where a surplus of either money 
or stores does unavoidably exLst when a sliij) is placed out of commission, the 
members of the mess have no claim whatever to any part of it, and it reverts 
to the Government, the stores beinij taken up as a ^ain on issues and the 
money being credited to the appropriation " Provisions, Navy." 

12. Subsistence of enlisted men absent from the ship on duty will, when 
practicable, be furnished by the general mess. When men are lauded in large 
numbers for an expedition or for going into camp with the expectation of 
b 'ing absent from the ship for more than twenty-four hours, the couunissary or 
the commissary steward, according to the proportion of the ship's company 
landed and the importiince of the expedition, together with such cooks and 
bakers as may be necessary, and a sufficient number of messmen, should con- 
stitute the commissary corps. 

The Commissary. — 18. The pay officer of the ship, or, in shi{)s having 
no pay oificer, an officer designated by the captiiin, is the commissiiry, and is 
solely responsible for the purchase and preparation of the food for the general 
mess, the care of the stores, and the judicious expenditure of mess funds, 
keeping the accounts of the mess and administering all its affairs except the 
serving of the food at the mess table. 

14. His authority in the performance of these duties is commensurate with 
his responsibility, and all persons employed in the service of the general mess 
are subject to his orders. 

15. The commissary should frequently inspect the storerooms allotted to 
the general mess, and see that the stores are properly stowed and that the 
rooms are dry and well ventilated. Any deterioration in the stores being a 
direct loss to the mess, great care should be exercised in their selection, and 
no greater quantity should be bought at one time than can be used within the 
period they may be expected to keep in good condition. 

16. The commissary should not permit any stores to be purcha.sed until a 
list of them has been submitted to him and carefully examined and approved. 
No stores should be received on board unless accompanied by a bill or memo- 
mndum by which they can be checked ofi'; and before being stowed awav all 
stores should be carefully inspected by the commissary or the conuuissary 
stew^ard. No bills should be contracted that cannot be paid from the funds in 
hand or by the ration money that will accrue to the mess during the current 
month. AH bills should be settled at the end of each month, and always 
before the ship sails from port. 

17. The commissary should keep the cash accounts of the mess so that they 
can be conveniently audited by the general inspector of the pay corps, the 
paymaster of the fleet, or by the board ay)pointed for the purpose. All ex- 
penditures must be substantiated by vouchei-s, which are to be exhibited when 
the accounts are inspected. 

18. He should cause the commissary steward to keep a stock account v.'hich 
should embi-ace all stores and all property of the general mess. The value of 
the balance shown upon this stock account should be taken into consideration 
in making up the statement of the financial condition of the mess. 

19. The commissary should, when he deems it advisable, submit written 
reports and recommendations to the captain re.garding the general mess, and 
he must do so whenever the interests of the mess require any change which he 
himself is not authorized to make. 

20. The commissary should mark the enlisted men of his department in 
proficiency in rating and should immediately report any inefficiency or careless- 
ness in their perfoi-mance of duty. 

21. He should frequently inspect the food before it is delivered to the mess- 
men at the galley, and in case he finds it improperly prepared, should take 
steps to prevent any further occurrence of the kind. If cooks are not thor- 
oughly competent, they should be made to follow strictly the recipes in this 
book, and flagrant cases of inconq)etency should be reported. 



692 ARMY AND NAVY RATIONS. 

The Commissary Stewards.— 22. The chief commissary steward or 
commissary steward is the chief petty officer in charge, under the commissary, 
of the general mess. He is entitled to respect and obedience from all persons 
of inferior rating while in the performance of his duties, and he is responsible 
for the proper execution of the orders of the commissary. The daily bill-of- 
fare should be made out by the commissary steward and submitted to the com- 
missary, and the necessary stores issued to the cooks at the galley. He should 
direct the manner of its preparation and shall be in charge of the galley and 
the men employed at it, and should frequently inspect the food before it is 
delivered to the messmen to be served. He should see that the galley and all 
the galley untensils are kept in proper condition, giving particular attention 
to their cleanliness. 

23. He should report to the commissary daily, in writing, all purchases 
made and debts contracted, and keep that officer advised of the needs of the 
mess. ' He is to draw from the pay department, at the appointed times, such 
Government stores as are due the mess, and must keep an account of these 
stores for the verification of the provision return at the end of each quarter. 
When fresh })rovisions are issued, he should be on deck, when practicable, to 
receive them from the representative of the pay department as soon as they 
have been received on board and inspected. In case these fresh provisions, or 
any other stores issued to the mess by the pay department, are, in the opinion 
of the commissary steward, of inferior quality and unfit for issue, he should 
report the matter to the commissary, who shall make a personal investigation, 
and, in case he finds the objection well founded, should take the necessary 
ste[)s to provide other stores, as prescribed by the regulations. An issuing 
book should be kept by the pay yeoman and signed daily by tlie connnissary 
steward, in order that no question may arise at the end of the quarter as to 
the stores drawn by the general mess. The commissary steward may, with the 
authority of the commissary, draw from the pay department such Government 
stores as are required in excess of the allowance, and these stores shall be paid 
for from the mess fund at the end of each month. 

The Cooks. — 24. Tlie senior cook, or, if there are two or more of the same 
rating, one selected by the commissaiy, sliould be in immediate cliarge of the 
galley and act in the capacity of head cook. He should be held strictly re- 
sponsiljle for the cleanliness of the galley and the utensils [lertaining to it, for 
the maintenance of discipline among his assistants, for the proper pre))aration 
of the food, and for having the meals ready at the prescribed hours. He 
should j)ersonally superintend th(^ rooking of all meals, and should carefully 
inspect all food before it is delivered to the messmen. It is his duty to report 
to the conmiissary any ineffifieticy or )ieulect on the pai-t of his assistants; 
otherwise th? entire blame lor ])oor coolciiiy- or ;uiy ollur delinquency at the 
galley slionld rest ui)on him. The head cook should keep the commis.s;iry 
steward informed as to the re(|uire!iients of the galley, and should from time 
to time prepare lists of articles recpn'red l)y him in his coolcinij:, which are not 
included in the navy ration. He is res])onsible for the galK\v utensils, and 
will report immediately when any are lost, worn out, oi' damaired. 

25. The other cooks should, as far as ])os'<ible, be a-sitrned specific duties at 
the galley in (^rder that the icsponsibility for any neiriect may readily be 
plac(!d. One should be detailed as "meat cook," another as '' \-e£;-etal»le cook," 
and one man should, in addition to other (huies, })e held ivsponsiljle for th<» 
})re[)aration of the cofiee and tea. 

2r). The cooks in the lower ratings should be detailed for starting lires, 
cleaning the galley and utensils (regular (deaning stations being assigned 
them), and for [jrcparing the food for cixiking. 

27. The oriranization of the force at tiie galh'y should be as complete and 
efficient a,s that of a gun division. 

The Bakers. — 2!^. The connnissary st<'\vanl should i,-sue to the baker such 
ouantities of flour and other ingredients as may be necessary for making l)read

for the mess and keep him advised of the amount of bread required from day 
to day. 

29. The baker, or, in sliips whieli are aUowcd two bakers, the baker first 
class, is to be hehl responsible for the proper baking of the bread and for its 
delivery to the mcssmen at the appointed times. He is also responsible for 
the condition of the bake-ovens and the utensils used by him. 

PART n.-THE COMMISSARY STORE. 

Establishment and Administration. — .'.O. Tiure l)eing no public 
funds available l"or the establishment of :v storr on board ships of the navy, 
such establishment is not made eom])ulsory, bui is ii'ft to the discretion of the 
commanding otHcer. The advantages of such a store are, however, so obvious 
and so great that {)rovision is made in the regulations for it> administration in 
shijis where it exists or may be established. 

ol. The objects of a connnissary store are: 

(1) To enable the men to purchase a better (juality of the articles 

usually obtained from bumljoat men, and at a lower price. 

(2) To return directly to the men all })rotits frc»m their })urrhases not 

needed for carrying on the business. 
{?>) To bring under official control the s;ile of all merchandise on 
board ship, and thus do away with bumboat men and peddlers, 
and reduce the chances of liquor or other unauthorized articles 
being brought on board. The sale of any merchandise on board 
ship, except by the store, should be prohibited as far as practi- 
cable. Tailoi-s, persons doing repairing, and those selling 
special articles which cannot conveniently be handled by the 
store, may be exempt from this prohibition, but dealei-s in 
milk, pies, fruit, and such articles should not be allowed to sell 
to the men. 
3C The commissary should make agreement with reliable merchants to 
supply to the store, while the ship is in port, such stores as are salable but 
can not be carried in stock, and these articles should be delivered to the store- 
keeper and by him sold to the men at a very small advance. For example, if 
it be thought advisable to have milk for sale in the store when the ship is in 
port, the comnnssary should arrange with a dealer to })lace on board, at a 
specified time each day, a quantity of milk at a fixed price, such quantity as 
may be sold to be paid for, and the balance to be taken away by the dcjiler. 

88. The stock being purchased from reliable fii'ins at wholesale prices, \\ill 
be better in quality and lower in price than that usually carried by bumboats 
or itinerant merchants. The greater part of the retail dealer's protit should 
revert directly to the purchaser at the time he buys the article — that is, tlu' 
price charged should be very little, if any, above the wholesale ])riee. Some 
profit must be made, however, and all that is not required for incidental ex- 
penses of the store must be turned over to the general mess fund, and thus it, 
also, reverts to the men in the form of delicacies for the mess table, siu'h as are 
not a part of the navy ration. 

84. In ships where the men desire to subscribe foi- t)ie original stock of a 
commissary store, and the commanding oiricer authorizes its establishment, the 
commissary is, by the regulations, placed in elun-ge of it. Tills officer is to 
receive voluntary subscriptions from the crew, giving them recei]»ts (stated to 
be not negotiable) for the amoinit subscribed, with the agreement that these 
receipts may be surivncU'red and the amoinit of the sul)scri])ti()n refunded after 
the original stock has been paid for and the business is on a good financial 
basis. The original stibscribei-s, after they have been ])aid the amount of tlieir 
subscriptions, have no further claim u})on, nor intei-est in, the store. 

35. During this period it is advisable to make the ])rices correspond with 
those of retail dealers in onler that the store may be independent as soon as 



694 ARMY AND NAVY RATIONS. 

possible, but when all indebtedness has been discharged and the store is self- 
supporting, the profits should be reduced to a minimum, it being always borne 
in mind that making money is not one of the objects of the store. The in- 
justice of making profits from sales to one set of men to be divided among 
another set at the expiration of a cruise is manifest, and for this reason the 
regulations provide that such profits be used to improve the bill-of-fare of the 
general mess, but with tlie present ample ration no addition to the mess fund 
should be necessary ; and, by reduction in prices from time to time, as experi- 
ence dictates, the monthly surplus should be reduced to a minimum, thus dis- 
posing of the regular retail dealei-'s profit in the most e(iuitable manner pos- 
sible, i. e., by giving the benefit of it to each purchaser in the form of a 
discount. 

36. It is impracticable to operate a store unless a suitable room, used for no 
other purpose and to which only the storekeeper has access, is available for 
the purpose. 

37. No cash will be received at the store for articles purchased, but sales 
will be made under the following system : 

Books of tickets of a form prescribed by the Bureau of Supplies and Ac- 
counts will be issued for cash by the pay officer and storekeeper and will be 
negotiable at the store in lieu of money. The issue of these books by the pay 
officer will be made at the same time as the issue of monthly money, and by 
the storekeeper daily during the month as the men may desire to purchaiie 
them. For the latter issues the pay officer will turn over from time to time a 
limited number of books to the storekeeper, who will be held strictly account- 
able therefor, and will turn in to the pay officer daily the money received for 



The Commissary. — 38. The commissary of the ship has charge of the 
ship's store. He is allowed the services of a yeoman for dutv as storekeeper. 
The commissary should give his pei-sonal attention to the purchase of stock for 
the store, should fix the prices at which the articles are sold, establish a 
business-like system for the operation of the store, and direct all its affairs. 
He should keep the casli account and cause the commissary stewaitl to turn in 
daily all money not required for making change. He is to turn over to the 
general mess fund, monthly, so much of the surplus of the store as is not re- 
quired for the purchase of new stock, and he should endeavor to so regulate 
the prices tliat this surplus will not be larger than necessarv. 

39. All the accounts of the coramissiiry store should be kept in such manner 
as to admit of ready inspection by the general inspector of the pay corps, the 
paymaster of the fieet, or by the b(xird appointed for that purpose. 

The Storekeeper.— 40. The storekeeper should be i-esponsible to the 
commissary for the pro])er conducit of the store. 

Pie is to keep the account of the stock, and of the sales, and submit to tlie 
commissary from time to time lists of articles required. 

41. In order to protect the store from any los,^, either throutrh caivlessness 
or dishonesty, the following method of keejting the accounts should be em- 
j)loye(l: 

At the end of each montli an account of stock should be taken by the com- 
missary steward or the paymastei-'s yeonian. and the ai-ticles found to i)e on 
hand entered in a book similar to the return of clothing and small stores. 
(This blank may conveniently be used for the purpf)se, the headings of the 
columns Ijeing changed.) These quantities represent *he sto(>k on hand at the 
beginning of the new month and to them should be added all stores received 
from purcha.'^e. At the end of the month the (luantities found to be on hand 
should be entenid in the proper line and subtracte<l from the total re(;eipts and 
the difference entered as "sales." liy multiplying the number of each article 
sold by its selling price and tiikinj; the total of that line in the return will l)e 
found the amount which the storekeeper should have received, and this 
amount he should be required to turn in or account for. 



NAVV RATIONS. G95 

42. If no prices are chanifed exeej)t at the he.i^iiuiiiit,'- of a month, and if the 
established prices are displayed on llu' store bulletin board so that no over- 
charn^es can be made, this system will be a simple and absolute check on the 
storekee])er. 

4o. The man selei'ted for tins i-es])onsible duty should, fust of all, be entirely 
trustworthy. He must hi' (juick and accurate at ii^urcs and write le<^ibly. it 
is his duty to ivceive such slock as may \)v delivered for llu- store, (-onveniently 
arrange it in the stoivroom, and keep the lattei- clean and see tluit it is ready 
for inspection at the ap[)oiiited times. He is to oj)en the sloi-e foi' the sale of 
merchandise to tiie men at suc-h times as may be a[)pointed by the com- 
missary, with the authority ol' the ca[)lain. 

lie should keep a small memorandum book in whit-h to enter the amounts 
turned in daily to the commissary, and when that ollicer receives the money, 
he should initial the amount in the book. 

PART m — THE PREPARATION OF FOOD. 

The Ration. — 14. The dietai-y of the enlisted men of the navy nmst neces- 
sarily be based upon the ration ])rovided by law. In <^eneral messes, where 
the circumstances are favorable, provisions which are not a part of the ration 
may at times be purchased, but articles of which there is a sui)[)ly already on 
board in the pay department should not be bought unless the * iovermneiit 
stores shall have deteriorated, in which case they should be sur\eyed and a 
new stock obtained at the first opportunity. 

45. Unless tliere should be some goixl reason for not doing so, the ollicial 
issuing table should be strictly adhered to, it having been arranged to give the 
necessary variety. 

The "Galley ".—4(i. The ship's galley for that ])art of it used by the general 
mess), together with its appurtenances, is under the charge of the connuiss;ii-y. 
That officer should see that the galley and its utensils are ])roperly cared for 
and are ready for inspection at the appointed times. lie should himself fre- 
quently inspect this part of his department and advise the tMjuipment othcer 
of any repaii-s or alterations needed, and should, when occasion demands it, 
furnish that officer with a list of galley utensils requiring a survc>y. 

Cooking. — 47. On board ship, where the ftu'ilities are necessai-ily restricted 
and the food lacking in variety compared to tliat obtainable on shoi-e, it is of 
the highest im])ortance that the very best results ]K)ssible under the circum- 
stances should he obtained. With a liberal allowance of cooks and bakers, 
and a judicious selection of the men for these rates, the navy ration should be 
so prepared a-s to give the enlisted men three nourishing and ])alatable meals 
each day, and it should be the duty of the connnissary department to see tliat 
this is done. 

Fre(pient inspectic^ns of the food h\ the connnissary and the commissary 
steward, and efficiency on tiie part of the cooks, alone can int^ure this. 



DIETARIES IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. 

The diet in public and in private or semiprivate institutions, 
which include armies, navies, hospitals, asylums, prisons, 
schools, colleges, and, in fact, any place where numbers of per- 
sons are fed under the direction of a steward, is a subject that 
requires close attention. During the past few years many diet- 
ary studies have been made, the greatest advantage following 
where the results of such studies have been applied. In the 
line of investigation much still remains to be done, however, 
for the public has not yet letirned the importance of applying 
scientific methods to the supply and culinary departments of 
its institutions. 

In applying modern methods to institutions a number of 
principles must be considered. These may best be understood 
from a careful review of Dunlop's Prison Dietaries, as given 
below, from which it will be seen that the amount of food nec- 
essary to nourish the body is taken as the starting-point. Tiiis 
amount is to be modified according to the condition of the indi- 
viduals to be fed. Age, sex, occupation, environment, physical 
condition, and the like must all be taken into account. The 
eva})oration and waste in food kept and used must be estimated 
and allowed for. The cost of the food is an important item. 
It must be borne in mind that it is often possible to supply a 
very acce})table meal at a moderate cost where more expensive 
articles of diet, while they might seem more desirable, would 
not answer the purpose so well. Tlie food must be suite<l to 
the digestive po^^■ers of the consumers, and must l)e served in 
as attractive and digesti})le a form as possible. It nuist be re- 
membered that wliile tlie numlxT of calories required may be 
estimated, tlici food representing tiiis amount nnist be suppb'ed 
in such form that it can V)e utilized by the individual receiving 
it. Atwatcr's standards for tlie various classes, as given below 
under Prison Diet, are in general use in this country. A vary- 
ing percentage is allowed for shrinkage and waste. This is 
usually placed at about K) per cent, of the t/)tal energy. Mrs. 
Richards estimates 10 ])('V cent, on the proteins and carbo- 
hydrates, and makes no allowance on the fats (in the standards 



ie 



PRISON DIETARIES. 697 

given below). Very complete dietary studies have been made 
by Atwater in the hospitals for the insane in New York State. 
These studies are pul)lisiied in the rei)()rts of the New York 
State Commission in Lunacy for 1897-98, 1898-99, and 1899- 
1900. The pecuniary advantage alone of this study is appar- 
ent from the fact that there was a reduction of $2.19 per capita 
nothwithstanding that the cost of food-products was higher 
than usual. The patients are })etter fed, and tlie diet is such as 
is best suited to their condition and surroundings. 

Atwater has suggested as a new profession that of dietary 
expert. This is a field for which women are perhaps particu- 
larly well adapted. The dietary expert is neither a cook nor 
an ordinary steward, but should be an individual who has had 
sufficient training along special lines to enable him to purclu 
food, formulate suitable and accurate diet-lists, supervise tl 
keeping, cooking, and serving of food, so as to obtain the be^t 
results, reducing the amount of waste to a minimum, and secur- 
ing as great a degree of perfection in the preparation of the 
food as it is possible to obtain. 

PRISON DIETARIES. 

The subject of Prison Diet has received considerable atten- 
tion, and the literature on the subject, although very large, is 
more or less inaccessible, being scattered, for the most part, 
throughout the reports of prisons and reformatories. 

Numerous views have been expressed regarding what consti- 
tutes a proper diet for a prisoner. In England tlie standards 
recommended by the committee appointed by the Commissioners 
of Prisons in 1878 were followed for many years. The plan 
that was pursued was to divide the prisoners into four classes : 

Class I. : Those confined for periods of seven days and less. 

Class II. : Those confined for peri(»ds of more than seven 
days and not more than one month. 

Class III. : Those confined for periods of more than one 
month and not more than four months. 

Class IV. : Tliose confined for periods of more than four 
months. 

This division was made in order to prevent those serving 
short sentences from receiving a full dietary. Since such pris- 
oners are for the most part drunken and disorderly persons, it 
was held that they might seek to be committed to prison for 
the sake of enjoying a short sentence with an abundant

IJIETAIUES IX PUBLIC lySTITUTIONS. 



supply of forxl. Under the Prison Commission's plan all the 
prisoners began with the first dietary after seven days, and if 
they were still in prison, they were put on the second, and so 
on. This plan is not a good one, for it would seem better to 
place all long-term prisoners at once on a sufficient and appro- 
priate diet. 

Prison dietaries are now formulated according to the stand- 
ards fixed for a healthy free man doing the same kind of labor. 
The following table, taken from Atwater,^ gives these standards :

oners, and to reduce the diets of individual prisoners should 
they be satisfied that those prisoners are persistently wasting 
food.^' 

The following directions relate to the foregoing dietaries, viz. : 

" 1. Each pint of soup must contain : (1) 1 ounce marrow 
bones or oxhead or J ounce hough, neck of beef, or other meat, 
and (2) be seasoned with pepper in a proportion not exceeding 
1 ounce to 100 pints and with salt 1 pound to 100 })ints. The 
first of these directions does not apply to soups served with the 
meat dinners of Eates VI. , VII., and VIII. 

"2. Each pint of broth shall contain 1^ ounces of barley, 
1 ounce of green peas, IJ ounces of leeks, carrots, turnips, or 
other similar vegetables, as may be most easily procured, and

'^ 15. In the evx^nt of the following articles of diet not being 
readily obtainable or excessive in price, the undernamed substi- 
tute may be used : 

'' Buttermilk. — Substitute skimmed or separated milk in equal 
quantity, or failing these, 2 ounces of cheese for each milk 
ration and 1 ounce sug-ar should that milk ration be due for a 
porridge meal. 

^' Potato. — Substitute 2 ounces rice and 8 ounces fresh vege- 
table for 1 pound potato, or failing fresh vegetable, 4 ounces 
rice. 

'' Cabbage or Other Vegetable (Rates VI., VII., and VIII.). 
— Substitute 4 ounces bread for 1 pound cabbage or other 
vegetiible.'^ 

American Prison Dietaries. — There is no dietary that 
can specifically be called American. In the best ordered prisons 
the dietaries are based on Atwater's standards. In many States 
the die^t is left to the steward of the prison, and no particular 
method is followed. Details will be found in the reports of 
the various institutions and also in the reports of conventions 
of charities and corrections. 

^English Prison Dietaries. — The Committee of 1899 
condemns the utilization of diet as a means of punishment, but 
recommends what amounts to the same, /. e., that the diet of 
prisoners who are sentenced for a term of less than three weeks 
be smaller than that of those who are sentenced for three months 
or longer. For short-term prisoners they recommend that the 
diet be "adequate in amount and kind to maintain health and 
strength during the single week," but it is not to be made at- 
tractive to the " loafer " or mendicant. The progressive system 
formerly in use is now condemned. The diet is to be adequate to 
nourish the body and maintain strength, so that at the end of his 
term the prisoner may be in condition to return to his occupa- 
tion. For fourteen-day sentences, however, the prisoner is kept 
the first seven days on a spare diet, and for the remaining seven 
receives a somewhat fuller diet. 

The Committee recognizes that the nature of the work the 
prisoner is doing should be considered, but does not attempt t-o 



708 DIETARIES IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. 

make any dietaries for local prisons along these lines ; since, 
therefore, the diet intended for prisoners at ordinary labor is 
barely sufficient, the prisoner at hard labor would, on the same 
diet, be underfed. The diet thus becomes a mode of punish- 
ment again, a practice that is to be condemned. 

The same Report advises a diflPerent diet for men, women, 
and children. Dunlop gives the following resume of the Eng- 
lish prison dietaries. 

Ordinary Prisoners'- Dietaries. — The dietaries recom- 
mended in the rejx)rt for ordinary prisoners are no fewer than 
nine ; three classes. A, B, and C, each class with three dietaries 
— No. 1 for men, No. 2 for women, and No. 3 for juveniles. 

'^ Class A Dietaries. — For prisoners with sentences of not 
more than seven days, and for prisoners with sentences of not 
more than fourteen days during the first seven days of their 
imprisonment. These dietaries are described in the Committee's 
report as ^ of the plainest food, unattractive, but good and 
wholesome and adequate in amount and kind to maintain health 
and strength during the single week.' They consist of bread 
and gruel for breakfast and supper, and bread Avith either potato 
or porridge or suet pudding for dinner. An allowance of milk is 
given as an extra to juveniles. The daily food-value is esti- 
mated by the Committee as consisting of — For men, protein 
3.88 ounces (109 grams) ; carbohydrate, 17.08 ounces (484.22 
grams) ; fats, 0.89 ounces (25.23 grams) ; for women, protein, 
2.71 ounces (79.38 grams) ; carbohydrate, 13.71 ounces (391.22 
grarns) ; fats, 0.74 ounces (20.97 grams) ; for juveniles, protein, 
3.93 ounces (111.40 grams); carbohydrate, 14.67 ounces 
(415.87 grams) ; fats, 1.48 ounces (41.94 grams). The energy 
value of such diets is found by calculation to be as follows : 
For men, 2667 calories; for women, 2124 calories; and for 
juveniles, 2552 calories. A comparison with the standards of 
prisoners' food requirements {vide p. 14 of this report) shows that 
the diet for men is insufficient except when the men are almost 
idle, that the diet for women is also insufficient exce])t when the 
women are idle, but that the diet for juveniles is sufficient.' 
From the fact that Class A Diets are insufficient for working 
men and women, it follows that these introduce a distinct penal 
element into the dietary regulation. It may be urged that 

'"Tlu; Coniinittce compare their dietaries with Kfinig's standard for mod- 
ei-at<' worlc. His male standard contains practically tlie same amount of pro- 
U'in :is the standnrd I. a-ives for moderate work, hut has more fat and less 
carlnjhydrate than mini-. The ener^ value is ])ractically the same." 



PIUSON DIETARIES. 709 

slight underfeedino: for a limited time does no serious harm. 
That may be so^ but an insufficient diet is essentially a penal 
diet ; shortening the application cannot make an insufficient diet 
a sufficient one, and therefore an insufficient diet for even a 
short application is a penal diet. 

" Class B DleU. — (1) For prisoners with sentences of more 
than seven days and less than fourteen days after the expiry of 
seven days of their sentence; (2) for prisoners with sentences 
of more than fourteen days and not -more than three months ; 
(3) for untried prisoners, offenders of the first division who do 
not maintain themselves, offenders of the second division, and 
debtors (untried prisoners and offenders of the first division 
receive tea or cocoa instead of gruel or porridge for breid^fast 
and supper). These diets consist of bread and gruel for break- 
fast, bread and potato with either tinned meat or beans and 
bacon, or soup, or suet pudding, or cooked beef for dinner, and 
bread with either porridge, gruel, or cocoa for supper. Juve- 
niles are allowed a small quantity of milk for breakfast. The 
food- value of these diets as calculated by the Committee is — 
for men, protein, 4.73 ounces (133.8 grams) ; carbohydrate, 
18.32 ounces (519.34 grams) ; fats, 1.38 ounces (39.12 grams) ; 
for women, protein, 3.94 ounces (116.68 grams) ; carbohydrate, 
11.87 ounces (434.59 grams) ; fats, 1.06 ounces (30.05 gramsj ; 
for juveniles, protein, 4.30 ounces (121.89 grams) ; carbo- 
hydrate, 19.15 ounces (439.13 grams); and fats, 1.85 ounces 
(50.74 grams). The energy values of these diets calculated 
from these figures are — for men, 3098 calories ; for women, 
2519 calories; and for juveniles, 2772 calories. A comparison 
shows that these three dietaries closely approximate to the 
standards for men, women, and juveniles doing a moderate 
day^s work. 

"Class C Diets. — For all ordinary prisoners with sentences 
of more than three months. These diets closely resemble those 
of Class B. They differ by having large allowances (^f some 
of the dinner dishes, as potatoes, beans, and suet pudding, and 
by cocoa being substituted for porridge or gruel at supper time, 
and in the female diet by tea being given instead of gruel at 
breakfast time. The Committee estimate the daily food-value 
of these diets as follows : That for men, ])rotein, 4.90 ounces 
(138.9 grams); carbohydrate, 19.15 ounces (542.87 grams); 
fat, 1.85 ounces (52.44 grams) ; for women, ]>rotein, 3.92 ounces 
(111.11 grams) ; carbohydrate, 14.89 ounces (422.12 grams); 
fats, 1.61 ounces (45.63 grams); for juveniles, protein, 4.59 



710 DIETARIES IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. 

ounces (130.11 grams); carbohydrate, 16.40 ounces (464.94 
grams) ; and fat, 2.05 ounces (58.10 grams). From the.<e 
figures the energy value of the diets appear to be — for men, 
3283 calories; for women, 2611 calories; and for juveniles, 
2980 calories. These three dietaries may all be described as 
being in excess of the requirements of the standards for moder- 
ate work.^' 

French Prison Dietaries.— The French use the canteen 
system. Prisoners having private means and working prisoners 
may purchase from the canteen certain food-supplies to augment 
the ordinary prison diet. This method has to recommend it 
the fact that it tends to make the idle prisoner work harder, 
but it has the disadvantage that it discriminates l)etween the 
poor and the well-to-do ])risoner. 

The French prisoner receives daily al)out 1 -J poun<ls of bread. 
He is given two meals a day — soup at 9 A. M. and a dish of 
vegetables at 6 p. m. Meat is served on fete days and on Sun- 
days, and to long-sentence prisoners on Thursdays. This dietary, 
without the extras, is not sufficient for a working-man. By 
the purchase of the su}~>plies allowed it may be rendered ample. 
From the canteen the prisoner may purchase daily IJ pounds 
of bread and a })ortion of one of the following : potatoes, 
cheese, butter, milk, salad, fruit, and beef. The daily value 
must not exceed 20 centimes for bread and 15 centimes for the 
other articles. The French use especial diets for the criminal 
insane, for the sick in hospitals, and for nursing mothers. 

Prussian Prison Dietaries. — These are somewhat simi- 
lar to the Frencli. Three meals are allowed daily. Meat is 
used sparingly, and the bulk of the diet consists of cereals and 
vegetables. No classification is made, so far as is known, ex- 
cept for nursing mothers, for those serving sentences of less 
than four days, and for prison oilences. 

HOSPITAL DIETARIES. 

There is a wide variation in the diet-lists of the various hos- 
pitiils, (htpendent on the size, income, management, etc., of the 
institute. These diet-lists are designated })y various names, 
according to tho ])ersons for whom tluw are intended and the 
articles of whi(;h they ai'e made U{). 

In children's hospitals the food i'or each infant should be pre- 
scribed individually. Vov convenience those over one year and 
imder two or two and one-half vears mav be ])ut on a suitable 



HOSPITAL DIETARIES. 711 

diet designated as " l)al)y diet." For older children the desig- 
nations for diets are the same as in hos})itals for adults. 

The diets in use in the average American hospitals are 
classified as follows : 

Ward Diet. — This is also known as " full " or '' house diet." 
It is the ordinary diet of all ])atients for whom special diet 
orders ha\x^ not been given. (\\y referen(!e to the hospital diet- 
lists given below the composition of the various diets can be 
learned.) 

lyight diet, also known as convalescent diet, is that used 
for convalescent })aticnts generally and for others for whom it 
is suitable. It consists of milk, broths, eggs, and such other 
foods as are easily digestible yet nutritious. 

Special Diets. — Under this heading are included dietary 
formulas suitable for those diseases in wdiich diet plays an im- 
portant part in the treatment. It includes such diets as have 
been recommended in certain diseases, and which bear the name 
of the inventor, as TuHheirs diet for aneurysm. Banting's diet 
for obesity, and such general diets as the following : 

Milk Diet. — This is composed entirely of milk, two to three 
quarts usually being allowed daily. 

Meat Diet. — This consists chiefly of nitrogenous animal foods 
with a minimum of sugars and starches. It is useful in certain 
diseases of the stomach where there is acid fermentation. It 
closely resembles the diabetic diet. 

Farinaceous Diet. — This is made u]) of milk, butter, and 
carbohydrates. It is prescribed for convalescents and in chronic 
nephritis, etc. 

Special or extra special articles of diet, as they are often 
termed, include all articles not on the regular diet-list for the 
day, and for which special orders are generally given. 

It is a tact nnich to be de]>lored that the c(^nmiissary de])art- 
ment of many large hospitals is ])oorly managed. In some, 
special hosj^ital stewards of experience are appointed, but in 
many the ordering and the preparation of the meals, and often, 
indeed, the distribution of the food to the ])atients, are assigned 
to inexperienced jjcrsons who are fmpiently ignorant of tlie 
requirements of the ])atients. As a result, errors in diet, with 
their conse(]uen('es, are common, and very often there is waste 
as well. In a large hospital a competent steward is a necessity 
and an economy as vrell. 

The physician should })rescribe the diet for each patient. It 
is a fact that in many hospitals where the catering is not defi- 



712 



DIETARIES IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. 



cient, the diet for patients is selected by the nurses, with the 
exception, perhaps, in the case of a few of the more important 
diseases, such as typhoid, diabetes, and the like. The conclu- 
sion to be drawn is obvious.

RECIPES. 

BEVERAGES. 

I/ime Water. — Into an eiirthen jar containing hot water 
stir a handful of fresh unslaked lime. Pour off and throw 
away the water as soon as it has settled. This first water con- 
tains the soluble potash salts which may be present in the lime. 
Add more water, allow it to settle ; then decant the clear fluid 
and bottle it. Water may again be added to the lime, and the 
mixture covered and allowed to stand to be decanted as needed. 

Almond Milk. — Blanch one pound of sweet and two of 
bitter almonds that have been soaked in cold water for twenty- 
four hours. This is done by pouring boiling water over the 
almonds, when, after a few minutes, they can easily be pressed 
out of their hulls. Grind the almonds in a mill or pound 
them in a mortar ; mix with a half-pint of warm milk or water, 
and allow the mixture to stand two hours, after which strain 
through a cloth, pressing the juice out well. Thirty grams of 
almonds yield 200 calories of heat ; 250 grams of milk yield 
1700 calories. — (^Wegele.) 

Brandy-and-egg Mixture. — Rub the yolks of two eggs 
with half an ounce of white sugar ; add 4 ounces of cinnamon 
water and then 4 ounces of brandy. Dose : One or two tea- 
spoonfuls every two hours, according to age. — (^Stokes.) 

Brandy-and-eg-g Mixture for Infants. — Beat up well 
the yolk of a raw egg ; ten dro})s of brandy ; one teaspoonful of 
cinnamon water; one coffeespoonful of white suii:ar. — (Louis 
Starr.) 

Cold 'Egg-nog. — Beat up an egg ; add to it two teaspoon- 
fuls of sugar, a glassful of milk, and a tablespoonful of brandy 
or good whisky ; mix thoroughly. 

Hot ;^gg-nog. — Beat up the yolk of one (;gg ; add a tea- 
spoonful or two of sugar and a glassful of hot milk ; strain, and 
add a tablespoonful of brandy or old whisky, or flavor with 
nutmeg or wine. 

Egg Broth. — Beat up an egg, and add to it half a t^ispoon- 
ful of sugar and a pinch of salt; over this pour a glass of hot

tablespoonfuls of lemon juice ; add from one to three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and a cupful (6 ounces) of cold water. 
Serve with cracked or shaved ice if desired. 

Lemonade No 2. — Pare the rind from one lemon, cut the 
lemon into slices, and place both in a pitcher with an ounce of 
sugar. Over this pour a ])int of boiling water and let it stand 
until cool. Strain and serve with cracked ice. — (^P((V)/.)

grape juice. Fill a large wineglass half iull of cracked ice. 
Pour the ii'-r^r^ and grape juice over this, s])rinkle sugar over it, 
and sorve. 

Oatmeal, Barley, or Rice Water. — From the r/rain : 
Use two tal)lesj)0()nfuls of grain to a (juart of water. The 
grain should have been previously soaked overnight or at least 
for a few hours. When re<piire(l for an emergency, the soaking 



CEREAL AND CEREAL GRUELS. 737 

may be dispensed with and tlie o-rain boiled for five minntes 
instead. The water in \\liic;h the o:rain was soaked sliould be 
ponred off and ircsh water added Ix'fore cooking. The grain 
shonld be boiled foi* several honrs, water being added from time 
to time to keep the (piantity np to a <[nart. Strain. This 
makes a somewhat thin, watery grnel. 

From 'prepared jJoars : Vai'ions brands of ])re})ared grain 
flonrs are on the market, such, for example, as Kobinson's 
Barley Flonr. These are all somewhat similar in ])reparation. 
From two rounded teaspoonfuls to a tables])ooid'ul of the ])re- 
pared flour is added to a ])int of boiling water, and this is 
boiled for from fifti'en to thirty minutes and then .-trained. 
jS^o previous soaking is re(|uired. 

CEREAL AND CEREAL GRUELS. 

Either the grain itself or the specially })rej)ared Hour may be 
used. When the grains are used they should be spread on a 
clean table and all foreign substances removed. , ]f the whole 
grains be used, it is well to wash them, after ])icking them 
over, with two or three changes of cold water. 

Cereals are best cooked in a double boiler. The lower part 
should be filled about one-third full of water, and, if more is 
added during the cooking, it should always be boiling hot. The 
C(^real should be cooked over the fire for ten or fifteen minutes. 
The water should be boiled first and then salted. The cereal is 
added gradually and the whole stirred to ])revent it from burn- 
ing. It should then be ])laced in a double boiler and steamed 
until thoroughly cooked. Cereals, like other starchy foods, 
require thorough cooking, jMost recipes allow too >hort a time. 
Oatmeal especially should ])e mentionetl. It develops a better 
flavor if cooked for three hours or more, and it is better when 
it is prepared the day before and reheated when used. It 
should be just thin enough to pour when taken out of the 
boiler, and when cooled should form a thin jelly. 

Anv cereal mush mav be thinned with water, milk or cream 
and made into a gruel, or the gi'uel may be made directly from 
the grain or flour. Gruels should be thin, not to sweet nor ti>o 
highly flavored, and served very hot. Milk gruels should be 
made in a double boiler. Gruels may be made more nutriticuis 
by the addition of whipped q^^^, either the w^hite or yolk or 
both, and the various c(3ncentrated food products. 

When cereal flours are used, the flour should be rubbed to a

ing water, stirring constantly until it is thoroughly mixed.

GENERAL RULES FOR COOKING VEGETABLES. 

Wash thoroughly ; pare or scrape if skins must be removed. 
Stand in cold water until cooked, to keep them crisp and pre- 
vent their being discolored. Cook in boiling water ; the water 



742 RECIPES. 

must be kept at the boiling-point. Use two teaspoonfuls of salt 
with two quarts of water ; put the salt into the water when the 
vegetables are partially cooked. The water in which vegetables 
are cooked is called vegetable stock. 

Fresh green vegetables require less water than others. 

Cabbage, cauliflower, onions, and turnips should be cooked un- 
covered in a large amount of water. 

All vegetables must be drained as soon as tender. Season 
with salt and pepper and serve hot with butter or sauce. 

The color may be kept in green vt^getables, such as spinach, 
by pouring cold water through them after draining. 

Cold vegetables may be used for salads or may be placed in 
a baking-dish with one-half the quantity of sauce (2 cupfuls 
vegetables and 1 cupful sauce), covered with buttered crumbs, 
and browned in a hot oven. 

Sauce for Vegetables : 

3 tablespoonfuls of butter. White pepper. 

3 tablespoonfuls of flour. 1 cupful of milk. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 1 cupful of stock. 

SOUPS WITHOUT MEAT. 

(Dkexel Institute.) 

These soups are thickened by using butter and flour ; this 
prevents a separation of the thicker and thinner parts of the 
soup. The butter should be heated until it bubbles, the flour 
and seasoning added, and enough of the hot liquid to make a 
smooth sauce thin enough to pour easily ; this should be poured 
into the rest of the hot liquid and cooked in a double boiler 
until the soup is of the proper consistence. 

In soups made of dried peas and beans soda is used to soften 
the casein ; it is also used in tomatoes to neutralize the acid. 
These soups must be served in hot dishes as soon as ready. 
Crisp crackers, croutons, or soup sticks may be served with them. 

Crisp Crackers : 

S{)lit and butter thick crackers and brown in a hot oven. 

Cream-of-Tomato Soup : 

1 can tomatoes. A cupful of (lour. 

,^ tejtspoonful soda. '.'>\ t('asj)()onfuls of salt. 

.'^ cupful of butter. o teaspoonful of white pepper. 

1 quart of milk. 
Stew the tomatoes slowly onc-hriif to one hoin', sti'aiu, and add soda wlule

MILK PREPARATIONS. 

Partially Peptoniijed Milk. — Into n cletin graniteware 
or porcelain-lined sancepan place one pint of milk, tbiir ounces 
of water, and the contents of one of FairchikFs ])eptonizing 
tubes, or five grains of pancreas exti'act and fifteen grains of 
bicarbonate of soda. Heat gradually luitil it boils, stirring con- 
stantly. Boil gently for ten minutes, strain into a clean bottle, 
cork, and keep in a cool place. IV^fore using shake tlie bottle 
M'cU ; serve hot or cold. J^rej)ared in this way it will not be- 
come bitter. 

Peptonized Milk (Cold Process.) — ^lix milk, water, 
and peptonizing agents as directed in the j)receding recipe, and 
immediately place the bottle on ice. l"se when ordinary milk 
is required. This is particularly suited for dyspeptics and in-

dividuals with whom milk does not, as a rule, agree. The 
flavor of the milk remains unchanged. 

Peptonized Milk (Warm Process.) — Put in a glass jar 
one pint of milk and four ounces of cold water ; add five grains 
of extract of pancreas and fifteen grains of bicarbonate of soda. 
After mixing thoroughly, place the jar in water as hot as can 
be borne by the hand (about 115° F.). This should be heated 
for from six to twenty minutes. At the end of this time it may 
be ])laced upon ice until recpiired. The contents of one of Fair- 
child's peptonizing tubes may be used in place of the pancreas 
extract. If the milk is to l)e kept for any length of time, it 
should be brought to a boil, to prevent the formation of too 
much peptone, which renders the milk bitter. 

Hot Peptonized Milk. — Mix together the usual pepton- 
izing ingredients and add a pint of fresh cold milk; after 
thoroughly shaking the bottle, place it on ice. When needed 
pour out the required amount, heat it, and drink it as hot as it 
can agreeably be taken. If required for innnediate use, the in- 
gredients may be mixed together in a saucepan and slowly heated 
to the proper temperature. 

Effervescent Peptonized Milk. — Put some finely crack- 
ed ice in a glass ; fill it half-full of Apollinaris, Vichy, or 
siphon water, and immediately add the pe])tonized milk. Drink 
while effervescing. Brandy may be added if desired, 

Specially Peptonized Milk. — This is to be used in the 
preparation of jellies, ])unches, and all recipes where the milk 
is to be mixed with fruit juices or acids. Prepare according to 
the hot process ; keep the milk at a temperature of llo° F. for 
one hour ; pour into a saucepan and bring to aboil. If required 
hot, this may be used immediately, or it may be set aside on ice, 
to be used later. If not heated for an hour, the milk will curdle 
on being mixed witli an acid. If not boiled, the peptonizing 
ferment will digest gelatin and prevent the formation of jelly. 

Peptonized Milk Jelly. — Soak well half a box of Cox's 
gelatin in four ounces of water. Take one ])int of hot spccia/ff/ 
peptonized milk and add four ounces of sugar. Put in the 
gelatin and stir until it is (Hssolved. Pare one fresh lemon and 
one orange, and add t\ut rinds to the mixture. Squeeze the 
lemon and the orange juice into a glass, strain, and mix with two 
or three tablespoonfuls of St. (Voix v\un, or brandy, if preferred. 
Add the juices to the milk, stirring constantly. Strain, and al- 
low it to cool to the consistence of syrup ; when almost ready to 
set, pour into cups and ^vt in a cold place Do not j)our the

milk into moulds until the mixture is nearly ready to set, other- 
wise it will separate in settiniji:. 

Peptonized Milk Punch. — In the usual milk puneh re- 
cipes the apeciallii peptonized milk may be used in ])laee of 
ordinary milk. Take a gohlet one-third lull of finely crushed 
ice; j)()ur on it a tiiblespoonful of rum and a dash of Curat.'ao, 
or any other liquor agreeable to the taste. V\\\ the plass with 
peptonized milk ; stir well, sweet(Mi to taste, and grate a little 
nutmeg on top. 

Peptonized Milk I^emonade. — Take a glass one-third 
full of cracked ice ; scpieeze into this the juice of a lemon, and 
add two or three teaspoonfuls of sugar dissolved in water, l^^ill 
the glass with fresh specially peptonized milk and stir well. If 
preferred, equal parts of milk and of an eifervescent mineral 
water may be used. Pour the water on the lemon juice and ice, 
and immediately fill the glass with milk. 

Peptonized Milk Gruel. — Mix with a teas]i<»onful of 
wheat flour, arrowroot flour, or Kobinson's Barley Flour with 
half a pint of cold water. Boil for five minutes, stirring con- 
stantly. Add one pint of cold milk and strain into a jar ; add 
the usual peptonizing ingredients; place in warm water (1 15° F.) 
for twenty minutes, and then upon ice. 

Junket, or Curds and Whey. — Take a half pint of fresh 
milk ; add one teaspoonful of Fairchild's Essence of Pepsin and 
stir just sufficiently to mix. l^)ur into custard cups, and let it 
stand until firmly curdled. It may be served })lain or with 
sugar and grated nutmeg. It may be flavored ^\•ilh vine, Avhieh 
should be added before curdling takes ])lace. 

Junket with Bgrg. — l)eat one egg to a froth, and sweeten 
with two teaspoonfuls of white sugar; add this to a half-})int 
of warm milk ; and then add one teaspoonful ol" e.-sence of 
pepsin and let it stand until curdled. 

Cocoa Junket. — Put an even tablespoonful of any good 
cocoa and two teas])o(»nfuls of sugar into a sauee-pan ; scald 
with two tablespooniiils of boiling water and rub into a smooth 
paste; then stir in thoroughly one-half jnnt of fresh, co<>i 
milk ; heat this mixture until it is lukewarm — not over 100° Y. 
— then add one teaspoonful of Fairchild's Essence of Pepsin 
and stir just enough to mix ; pour quickly into small cups or 
glasses, and let it stand until iirmly curdled, when the junket is 
ready for use. It may be ])laced on ice and eaten cold ; as a 
dessert it mav be served with whipped cream. — (^Faircluld.) 

Coffee Junket. — Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of sugar in two 



746 RECIPES. 

tablespooD fills of clear, strong coffee ; mix this thoroiiglily with 
one-half pint of fresh, cool milk ; add a teaspoouful of Fair- 
child's Essence of Pepsin as directed above, and serve in the 
same way. 

lodi^^ed Junket. — Prescribe a satnrated solution of potas- 
sium iodid and also a b(jttle of essence of pej)sin. Take one- 
half teacupful of milk and add the required number of drops 
of the iodid solution. Heat the milk hike warm and add two 
or three teaspoonfuls of the pepsin and let it stand until curdled. 
This will be found useful where it is difficult to administer the 
iodid by ordinary methods. 

Vanilla, Bitter Almond, or Strawberry Junket. — 
Add the flavoring extract to the cold milk and then prepare in 
the usual way. One-half teaspoouful of vanilla or bitter al- 
mond extract or a tablespoonful of a pure concentrated straw- 
berry syrup should be allowed to a half-pint of milk. 

Milk I^emonade. — Take two ounces of sugar, five ounces 
of boiled milk, one-half lemon, or two ounces of white wine, 
five ounces of boiling water, and the rind of half a lemon. 
Pour the boiling water over the peel and the sugar ; allow it to 
cool, add the milk, and then the lemon juice or wine. Strain 
after ten minutes. 

Milk Punch, — Shake together in a lemonade-shaker a glass 
of milk, a tablespoonful of rum, brandy, or good old w^iisky, 
and two teas]X)onfuls of sugar. After it has been poured into 
a glass a little nutmeg may be grated over the top. 

Milk Porridg^e. — Mix a tablespoonful of flour with one- 
fourth cupful of cold milk and stir into one-fourth cupful of 
hot milk ; if desired, add two raisins cut into quarters. Cook 
over boiling water for one hour, and add oue-quarter teaspoouful 
of salt just before serving. — (J)rcxel Inditufc) 

Whey. — Take a half-pint of fresh milk heated lukewarm 
(115° F.j, add one tables])oouful of essence of })epsin, and stir 
just enough to mix. When this is firmly coagulated, beat up 
with a fork until the curd is fincily divid(.*d and then strain. For 
flavoring purposes lemon juice or sherry wine may be added. 

Grape Juice Whey. — Make whey as in the above re(!i])e. 
To this add tho juice of an orange and a (piarter of a ])int of 
gra])e juice. Strain again if necessary. This may be served 
hot or on cracked ice. Jt may be sweetened if desired. 

Cream-of-tartar Whey. — Add a hea])ing teaspoouful of 
cream of tartar to a ])int of boiling water. Strain, sweet<'n to 
tiiste, and serve cold. — (Pd >•>/.) 



MILK J'llKPAILiTIOXS. 747 

"Wine Whey. — Cook t(\(^otiu'r a eu])tul of milk and half" a 
cupful of rilu'iTv wiuo. As soou as the curd separates, strain 
and sweeten. Tliis may be eat(;n l»ot or eold. 

I/emon Whey. — This is made in the same way as the fore- 
l^oino; reeipe, using three tal)les})oonfuls of lemon juice instead 
of tlie wine. 

Kumiss No. I. — Take a (piart of skim milk, one-fifth of a 
cake of yeast, and two tahlespoonfuls of su<xar. Heat the milk. 
Dissolve the yeast in a little water and mix it with the sui2;ar 
and luke^'arm milk. Pour the mixture into strong- bottles, 
stopper them tightly with new corks, and tie down the cirks 
with stout twine. Shake the bottles well and })lace in a refrii^- 
erator ; this will allow the mixture to ferment slowly. After 
three days lay the bottles on their sides, turning them occasionally. 
Five days are re({uired to com])lete the fermentation ; the kumiss 
is then at its best. — (Drcxel Tnsflt)if(\) 

Kumiss No. 2. — Pour into wired bottles one quart of fresh 
milk, half an ounce of sugar, a piece of fresh yeast cake half 
an inch square, and keep at a temperature between G0° and 70° 
F. for one week, shaking five or six times a dav; then put upon 
ice— (Holt.) 

Kefir With Kefilac Tablets. — Pour into a well cleaned 
quart bottle one pint of pure milk, which has been boiled and 
cooled to lukewarm temperature. 

Put one Kefilac tablet, crushed, into the bottle and shake thor- 
oughly until dissolved. Cork tight with a good, clean cork. 

Place the bottle at a temperature of the ordinary living room 
(70°-75°), lying on its side. As fermentati(m advances, a curd 
^vill be observed forming in the bottle. Shake thoroughly four 
to five times a day until ready for use. This curd re-forms 
when the bottle is at rest, and should be shaken thoroughly each 
time the contents are used. 

After the first day a slightly sour, after the second day med- 
ium strong, sweetish sour, and after the third day, a strong, sour 
tasting, lightly foaming kefir is produced. One day old kefir 
is slightly laxative. For general use, fbrty-eight-hour kefir is 
recommended. 

If the kefir does not turn out right, as sometimes ha])pens, 
when impure milk is used or whenever changeable weather ])re- 
vails in the summer, it is necessary to cleanse the bottle thor- 
oughly, aiul boil it in a soda solution for live minutes before 
using again. 

If a larger quantity of kefir than one pint is to be made, one 
tablet should be used for each extra pint, and this proportion

continued. It should be carefully noted that the bottle should 
be twice the size of its contents, in order to provide for fermen- 
tation. After fermentation is complete, which is about forty- 
eight hours, kofir remains good for several days, if kept on ice. 

Kefir may be used freely, and to the same extent as ordinary 
milk. From one pint to three quarts per day, according to re- 
quirements of the individual. 

Milk Mixture. — This is made of cream, two parts ; milk, 
one part ; lime water, two parts ; suirar water, three parts (sev- 
enteen and three-fourths drams of milk sugar to a pint of water). 
—{A.V.Meigs.) 

Milk-and-cinnamon Drink. — Add a small amount of 
cinnamon to the desired quantity of milk and boil it. Sweeten 
with sugar and add brandy if desired. — (Iiiuf/er.) 

Albuminized Milk. — Shake in a covered jar or lemonade- 
shaker a cupful of milk, a ta1)lespoonful of lime-water, and tlie 
white of an egg. Sweeten, flavor as desired, and serve at once. 

Milk-and"- cereal Waters. — A most valuable method of 
preparing miJk for invalids Avith whom it disagrees is to mix- 
equal parts of milk and thoroughly cooked barley, rice, oat- 
meal or arrowroot water and boil them together for ten minutes. 
This may be served plain, or flavored by cooking with it a cut- 
up raisin, a sprig of mace, or a piece of stick cinnamon, which 
should be strained out before serving. 

Irish Moss and Milk. — Soak about two tablespoonfuls 
of Irish moss for five minutes and wash thoroughly in cold 
water. Add to a cupful of milk and soak for half an hour ; 
then heat slowly, stirring constantly, and then boil for ten min- 
utes, preferably in a double boiler ; strain, and pour into ('U])s 
and cool. This may be served while hot, and may be rendered 
more nutritious by the addition of the white of an Qgg stirred 
into it just before serviug. 

l^gg and Buttermilk Mixture. — Lightly beat the white 
of one egg and from one to four ounces of cream. Pour ijito 
a glass, and fill with fresh buttermilk. Stir well. 

Milk with Other Diluents. — Milk may be diluted with 
advantage in many cases })y adding lime water, or Vieh\', 
Apollinarls or some other sparkling table water. From one- 
half to one-eighth the total volume may be added.

Hard=cooked Eggs. — Place in water, brintr to a l)oil, and 
then set on the back part of the stove for twenty minute.^. 

Eggs should be served as soon as cooked, and the dishes 
should be warmed and ready. 

EGGS AND IVULK. 

Rules for Custards. — The eggs should be thoroughly 
mixed but not beaten light, the sugar and salt added to these, 
and the liot milk added slowly. Custards nuist be cooked over 
moderate heat ; if a custard (;urdles, put it in a pan of cold 
water and beat until smooth. Custards should always be 
strained. — {^Drexd Jnditute.) 

Soft Custard. — Take a pint of milk, the yolks of two eggs, 
tw^o tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a pinch of salt. Mix all 
except the milk in a bowd. Heat the milk to the boiling-point 
and add constantly. As soon as mixed, pour into the saueejnin 
in which the milk has been heated and cook from three to live 
minutes, stirring constiuitly until it thickens. Strain, and ]H)ur 
into a cold bowl, and flavor with from half to one teas|K)onful 
of vanilla, a teaspoonful or more of sherry, or other flavoring 
material as desired. Custards may be cooked to ad\antage in 
a double boiler. 

Chocolate Custard. — Melt half an ounce of Baker's choco- 
late and add to the milk, an(i ])roceed as above. 

Steamed Custard. — INlix tlie above, using the whole eggs in- 
stead of the yolks. Strain, pour into cups, and steam over 
boiling water until lirm. 

Baked Custard. — Proceed as above, but pour the custard into 
baking-cups. Place the cu})s in a deep baking-pan and till the 



750 RECIPES. 

pan nearly as high as the cups with boiling water. Place in the 
oven and bake twenty minutes or longer, according to the size 
of the cup. When done a clean knife thrust into the custard 
comes out clean ; if it is not done, it comes out covered with 
milk. 

MEATS. 

General Rules for Preparing Meat. — Meat must be 
weighed, trimmed, and wiped wnth a damp cloth. It should 
be removed immediately from the paper in w hich it was wrapped 
and placed in a cool place. Only tender cuts of meat should 
be broiled, pan-broiled, or roasted. When meat is to be cooked 
by any of these methods, it should first be seared, and then the 
temperature slightly low^ered ; by searing, the albumin on the 
outer surface of the meat is hardened and the meat is thus 
cooked in its own juices. 

Tough meat should be cooked in water; boiling water hardens 
the albumin on the outer surface of the meat and prevents the 
juices from escaping. Meat should be put in boiling water and 
the water allow^ed to boil for ten or fifteen minutes ; then the 
cooking should be allowed to proceed at a low temperature until 
the meat is tender. If the water bubbles, it is too hot. Cooked 
in this way tough meat will become tender. The time required 
for roasting or cooking in water varies with the weight and 
quality of the meat. 

For roasts weighing less than 8 pounds allow ten minutes to 
the pound and ten minutes extra ; for those weighing from 8 to 
12 pounds, allow twelve minutes to the pound and twelve 
minutes extra ; for those weighing over 12 pounds, allow fifteen 
minutes to the pound and fifteen minutes extra. For meat 
weighing less than 10 pounds, to be cooked in water, allow 
twenty minutes to the pound and twenty minutes extra. 

The time required for broiling meat varies with the thickness 
of the meat. 

Stock and })roth are prepared by prolonge<l soaking of the 
meat in cold water and then cooking it at a low temperature for 
several hours, allowing it to cool uncovered. The meat that 
remains after straining may be utilized in various ways, adding 
a little fresh meat to give it flavor. 

The fat must not be removed from stock or broth, f )r it ex- 
cludes the air and prevents decoin])()sition. It must, liowever, 
be entirely removed before the stock or })roth is used ; this fat 
may be used in place of drippings. Tlie trimmings of fat from 



GENERAL RULES FOR SOUPS. 751 

meat should he clarified. Small o^lohides of fat mav he removed 
from cold broth with a cloth that has been (li|)p('d in boilino^ 
water and then wrimi!: dry. Fat mav \)v removed from hot 
broth by means of tissue-paper or a slice ol' bread. 

Cooking Tender Meats. — iiOdstimj. — Skewer the meat 
into shape. Place it on a rack in a meat pan, into the bottom 
of which pieces of fat from the meat have l)een ])laced. Put 
in a hot oven on the i^rate for ten minutes, to sear the meat. 
li desired it may be seasoned with salt and pep])er. Then 
remove to the floor of the oven and baste every ten minutes, 
until it is done. 

Broiling. — Remove extra fat from the meat and ^'•rease the 
broiler with a part of the fat. Broil over a clear fin^ ; sear, and 
then turn every ten seconds. Chops one inch thick should be 
cooked for five minutes. A steak two inches thick should be 
cooked for ten minutes. Season and serve on a hot platter. 

Pan-hroUincj. — Remove all the fat from the meat. Heat a 
frying-pan very hot, but use no fat. Sear the meat on both 
sides, and then cook more slowly until it is done. St^md chops 
up on their edges to brown. Keep the pan free from fat. The 
time required for pan-broiling is the same as that recjuired lor 
broiling. — [Drexel Institute.^ 

GENERAL RULES FOR SOUPS. 

Both meats and vegetables should be cut into small pieces. 
The soup should be started with cold water poured over the 
meats and the heat applied gradually and the soup allowed to 
simmer, in order to dissolve as much of the nutriment as 
possible. If heated rapidly the albumin in the meat coagulates, 
and little but the extractives passes into the soup. The vege- 
tables are added when the soup is nearly done. 

Remove the fat by skimming, by using blotting-paper, by 
straining through a cloth wet in cold water, or, best of all, by 
cooling the soup when all the fat rises to the t<>p, wlien it can 
be easily removed. 

Clear sou])s mav be rendered more nutritious by the addition 
of sago or of some cereal, as barley or rice. These may also be 
added with advantage to many thick SiUips. 

Soups should always be served hot. Soup jellies are served 
cold, and in hot weather may be substituted for warm soups. 

Soups may also be made from soup stocks, which may be 
prepared in any quantity and kept for several days. Stocks 
may be made from any meat. Those made from chicken or 



752 RECIPES. 

veal are light in color, and those from beef and mutton some- 
what darker. Stocks may also be made by using the bones 
from any kind of meats. 

Soup Stock. — To make stock, use a chicken or several 
pounds of bones with some meat attached, or a pound of lean 
meat and one quart of water. Cut-up vegetables may be added 
as desired. For flavoring add a sprig of parsley and of celery, 
'd j^eppercorn, a small onion, and a scant teas])oonful of salt. 
Any of the flxavoring vegetables may be omitted as desired or 
otliers added. The meat should simmer for several hours, until 
but half the quantity of water remains. Then add the other 
ingredients, simmer half an hour longer, strain and cool. 
Remove the fat. 

Soup Stock from Beef Extract. — Cook the other ingredi- 
ents, except the salt, as given above, for half an hour, using a 
quart of water. Then add a teaspoonful of })eef extract and a 
quarter of a teaspoonful of salt. 

Soup from Stock. — Rice, tapioca, or wliatever is desired is 
cooked and the stock added, with additional seasoning as thought 
necessary. Cream, yolks of eggs, Irish moss, cornstarch or 
arrowroot may be added to render the soup more nutritious. 

Chicken Broth. — Take one pound of chicken and a pint 
of cold water. Clean the fowl, cut it into pieces, and remove 
the skin. Separate the meat from the bone and chop the meat 
very fine. Place with the bones — if large, they should be 
broken — in the water and soak for an hour. Cook over hot 
water for four or five hours at a temperature of 11)0° F. Strain 
and add salt. Water must be added from time to time to keep 
the quantity up to a pint. Remove the fat. If the broth is to 
be reheated use a double boiler. 

Sweetbread Soup. — The sweetbread is soaked in cold 
water for one hour, the water being renewed frequently during 
this time. It is then boiled for one hour in slightly salted 
water or beef brotli, to wliicli one may add one teaspoonful of 
julienne to improve the taste. Aiter it is soft the sweetbread 
is taken out of the b(;ef broth and all blood-vessels and skin 
are removed. It may now be cut into pieces the size of a 
walnut and put on a }>lat", over which the beef l)roth is })0ure(], 
or the sweetbread may he iorcc.'d through a sieve, beef broth 
poured over this, and th" whole {)ut on the fire again until it 
boils, after which the soup may be served. This Litter process 
is to he recommended in the case of dyspeptics. One hun- 
dred drains of raw sweetbread generate about 90 calories of 
heat. — ( Wiyek.) 



GENERAL RULES EOR SOUPS. 753 

Meat Broth (Beef, Veal, Mutton, or Chicken).—- 

Cover one pound of chopped le:in meat with one pint of \v:iter

a slow fire for an hour until reduced to half the (piantity. 
Cool, skim, pour into jar and strain. 

Veal Broth. — Pour a pint of wat^T on a half-pound of 
finely chopped lean veal and allow it to stand ior three hours. 
Boil for a few minutes, strain, and season with salt. 

Clam or Oyster Juice. — ('ut tlu^ dams or oysters into 
pieces and heat for a few minutes in tlunr juice. Strain throu<]^li 
muslin and serve while hot. In stminintr (rreat care must he 
taken that sand does not pass through the nuislin. The juices 
should be diluted and may be frozen. — (Drrxcl Justifulc.) 

Clam Broth. — A¥ash three larc^e clams very thorou<r]ily, 
usini>; a brush for the ])urpose. Place in a kettle with half a 
cupful of cold water. Heat over the fire; as soon as tlie shells 
open the broth is done. Strain through muslin, season, and 
serve. — [Drexel Institute.) 

Mutton Broth with Vegetables. — Allow one ]iound of 
neck mutton to each pint of water; add carrots, turnips, onions, 
and barley ; let all simmer together for three hours. 

Mutton Broth without Meat. — Cook two '' shank- 
ends'' in a pint of cold water, and vegetables as directed in the 
foregoing recipe ; simmer for three hours and strain. 

Beef Tea No. I. — Cut up a j)ound of lean beef into 
pieces the size of dice ; put it into a covered jar with two ])ints 
of cold water and a pinch of salt. Let it warm gradually and 
simmer for two hours, care being taken that it does not at any 
time reach the boiling-point. — (ico.) 

Beef Tea No. 2. — Put a pound of finely mixed beef 
with a pint of cold water into a suitable vessel, l^et it stand 
for an hour, stirring occasionally. I^it the vessel containing the 
beef into a saucepan of water, ])lace it over the fire, and allow 
the water to heat gently for an hour (or the vessel containing the 
beef tea may be j)ut into an ordinary oven for an hour.) Pass 
the beef tea through a strainer. A fine sediment appears in the 
fluid, and this should be drunk with the liquid. Flavor with 
salt. At no time should the beef extract be exposed to a tem- 
perature of more than 170° F. — (I^tvy.) 

Beef Tea No. 3. — Chop fine a pound of beef free from 
fat, tendons, etc., and digest with a pint of cold water for two 
hours. Let it simmer on the stove for three hours at a tem- 
perature never above 160° F. Replace the water lost by

evaporation by adding cold water, so that a pint of beef tea 
shall represent a pound of beef. Strain and carefully express 
all iluid from the beef. — (Bartholow.) 

Beef Tea with Oatmeal. — Mix thoroughly one table- 
spoonful of groats with two of cold water ; add to this a pint 
of boiling beef tea. Boil for ten minutes, stirring constantly, 
and strain through a course sieve. — (Yeo.) 

Beef Tea, Flavored. — Beef tea may be flavored agreeably 
by boiling in it a pinch of mixed herbs, a bay-leaf, or a bit of 
onion, carrot, turnip, or celery and a few peppercorns. The 
roots should either be chopped small or be scraped to a pulp 
before being added to the broth. — ( Yeo.) 

Beef Juice. — Broil quickly pieces of the round or sirloin 
of a size to fit the opening in a lemon squeezer. Both sides of 
the beef should be scorched quickly to prevent the escape of 
the juices, but the interior should not be fully cooked. As soon 
as they are ready the pieces of meat should be squeezed in a 
lemon squeezer previously heated by being dipped in hot water. 
As it drips the juice should be received into a hot wineglass; it 
should be seasoned to the taste with salt and a little Cayenne

Cold Beef Juice. — Cover one pound of finely chopped 
lean beef with eight ounces of cold water and allow it to stand 
for eight or ten hours. Squeeze out the juice by means of a 
muslin bag ; season with salt or sherry wine and drink cold or 
slightly warmed. It may be added to milk, care being taken 
that the milk be not too hot before tlie juice is added. 

Iced Meat Extract. — Cut into pieces the size of a hand 
one kilo of fresh beef; wrap in a coarse, lattice-like linen bag, 
put under a lever press, and press slowly. The juice should be 
caught in a porcelain dish. This is done best by a druggist. 
By this method about 500 gm. of juice are obtained. Tlie juice 
is mixed with 250 gm. of sugar, 200 gm. of freshly expressed 
lemon juice (this last is best omitted in the case of dyspeptics), 
and 20 gm. of cognac containing vanilla extract ; stir in well the 
yolks of three eggs ; the entire mixture is then placed in a 
freezer. — (v. Ziemssen.) 

Raw-meat Juice. — Add to finely minced rump steak cold 
water, in the proportion of one part of water to four ])arts of 
meat. Stir w(?ll together, and allow it to stand for half an 
hour. Forcibly express the juice through muslin, twisting it to 
get the best results. — ( ( lieadle. ) 

Succus Carnis (Meat Juice.) — Cut up the meat into

small bits, arranoe in layers separated from one another by 
coarse linen, and then place in a powerful press. From each 
kilogram of meat about 230 gm. of a l)Iood-red juice are 
obtained. This contains about G per cent, of albuminates. Its 
taste is similar to that of raw meat ; its flavor may be improved 
by the addition of salt and beef tea not hot enough to coagulate 
the albumin. — (^Pdtciih offer and Voit.) 

Beef Essence. — Chop up very fine a pound of lean beef 
free from fat and skin ; add a little salt, and })ut into an earthen 
jar with a lid ; fasten up the edges with a thick ])aste, such as is 
used for roasting venison in, and place the jar in the oven for 
three or four hours. Strain through a coarse sieve, and give the 
patient two or three tablespoonfuls at a time. — ( Wo.) 

American Bouillon (American Broth.) — Place in a 
tin vessel that can be sealed hermetically alternate layers of 
finely minced meat and vegetables. Seal it, and keep it heated 
in a water bath (bain marie) for six or seven hours, and then 
express the broth. — ( Yeo.) 

Bottle Bouillon. — Cut beef, free from fat, into squares. 
Place these in a stoppered bottle, put the bottle in a basin of 
warm wat^r, heat slowly, and boil for twenty minutes. There 
will be about an ounce of yellowish or brownish fluid for each 
three-quarters of a pound of meat used. The flavor is that of 
concentrated bouillon. — ( Uffelmann.) 

Peptonized Oysters. — To half a dozen oysters with their 
juice add half a pint of water and boil for a few minutes. 
Pour off the broth and set it aside. Mince the oysters, and 
with the aid of a potato-masher reduce to the consistence of a 
paste. Place this with the brotli in a glass jar and add fifteen 
grains each of extract of pancreas and of bicarbonate of soda 
and mix. Allow this to stand in hot water (115° F.) for one 
and one-half hours. Pour into a saucepan and add half a pint 
of milk ; heat over a slow fire to boiling-point. Flavor with 
salt and pepper and serve hot. Let the heating be done 
gradually, and be careful to bring the mixture to a boil before 
taking it from the fire. — (^FairchUd,) 

Peptonized Beef. — Cover one-fourth of a pound of finely 
minced lean beef (or beef and chicken mixed) with half a })int 
of cold water. Cook over a slow fire until it has boiled for a 
few minutes, stirring constantly. Pour off the broth and rub 
or pound the meat to a paste. Put meat and broth and half a 
pint of cold water in a glass jar, and add twenty grains of ex- 
tract of pancreas and fifteen grains of bicarbonate of soda.

are usually easily digested. Cereals may be added, boiling with 
half the amount of water previously directed, and mixing all 
together before peptonizing. At the end of three hours the

METHODS OF PREPARING RAW BEEF. 

Meat given raw should always be perfectly fresh and very 
finely divided. Scrape iha meat with a sharp knife, which will 
separate the coarser fibers. If the resulting mass is stringy, pass 
through a fine sieve. This may be seasoned with salt and pep- 
per, and served on toast, crackers, or bread and butter. It may 
be rolled into small balls and swallowed. These may be flav- 
ored as desired. They may also be slightly browned by rolling 
about rapidly in a hot saucepan, care being taken not to change 
any but the outside of the ball, and that but slightly. Scraped 
beef may be served as a liquid or semi-solid food. Mix it with 
an equal quantity of cold water until it is quite smooth. Place 
in a double boiler and cook until thoroughly heated, stirring con- 
stantly. Add a little salt and pepper and serve at once. This 
may be made thicker by adding less water. 

Raw Meat with Milk and Sugar. — Scrape half a pound 
of rump steak with a knife until all the pulp is removed ; 
sweeten with sugar, breaking the lumps of sugar with the meat 
in a basin with a small wooden s})Oon. Add slowly as much 
milk as will make it about the thickness of arrowroot ; flavor 
with brandy. If any fiber of the meat remains, strain through 
a gravy strainer. The mixture should be perfectly smooth. — 
(^liinf/er.) 

Raw-beef Soup. — This is made by chopping up one pound 
of raw beef and placing it in a bottle with one ])int of water 
and five drops of strong hydrochloric acid. This mixture is 
allowed to stand on the ice overnight, and in the morning the 
bottle is placed in a pan of water at 110° F., and kept at about 
this temperature for two hours. It is then placed in a stout 
cloth and strained until the mass that remains is almost dry. 
The filtrate is given in three portions daily. If the taste of the 
raw meat is objectionable, the meat may quickly be roasted on

Veal-bone Jelly. — Place teu pounds of veal bones and 
ten quarts of water or weak bouillon over the fire and bring to 
just a boil. Skim and add two pounds of barley and a little 
salt. Simmer for five or six hours and then strain. If too 
thick, dilute, before serving, with l)ouillon. Stir in the yolk 
of an egg in a cup and serve. 

Meat Jelly. — This is made by cooking good boneless, lean 
beef on a water bath with a little water for sixteen hours or 
until it becomes gelatinized. Of the artificial preparations on 
the market for making bouillon, the most reliable is Liebig's 
Extract of Meat (10 : 250 gm.) or Cibil's Bouillon (1 teaspoon- 
ful to 250 gm.). Inaglio's ])ouillon capsules are also very con- 
venient. If it is desired to make the bouillon more nutritious, 
one teaspoonful of meat peptone may be added. — [Hepp.) 

Jelly for Dyspeptics. — Remove the skin and meat from 
one calf's foot; wash the bones and place in cold water on the 
stove ; when it begins to foam, skim off the refuse which gath- 
ers on top. After rinsing off the scum with cold water, put 
the bones into a pot with one-quarter kilo of beef or half an 
old hen, one-quarter liter of water, and 5 gm. of salt, and boil 
slowly for from lour to five hours. Pour the jelly thus formed 
through a fine sieve, and place overnight in a cellar. Next 
morning remove the fat, and clarify the cold jelly by adding one 
Qg^fi, with its shell mashed, beating and stirring steadily. Then, 
with the addition of a little cornstarch, subject the whole to a 
temperature not over 60° R., or the white of the egg will cur- 
dle. Constantly beat and stir. If the jelly begins U) get 
grainy, cover and let it cool until the white of the ngg becomes 
flaky and separates. Then strain again several times until it 
becomes perfectly clear; add 5 gm. of extract of meat, ])<)ur the 
jelly into a mold, and let it cool again. The gravy from a 
I'oast may be utilized and is very ])alatable. It must be stirred 
in while the mass is still warm and llcjuid. Thi.s jelly is usually 
relished with cold fowl, but spoils easily in summer; it must 
tlicrefbr(3 be kept on ice. — ( Weil.) 

Dishes Made with Gelatin. — Gelatin should be soaked 
in cold water for about half an hour to soften it. It may then 
be easily dissolved by adding boiling water. \( it is desired to 
sol'len gelatin (jiiickly, it should be ])l:iee(l in cold water and 
gradually heated over boiling water until it dissolves. If a 
jelly is to be strained, a wet cloth >lioul(l l)e used for the ])ur- 
])ose. Jelly molds should be wet with cold water before being 
filled. When granulated gelatin is used, nuich smaller amounts 
are re((uired than when the ordinary form is used.

Soy Bean Cookery.^ — In diabetes the beans may be added 
to the diet simply to give variety, and they may also be used 
to great advantage in connection with an otherwise carbohydrate- 
free diet, particularly in those cases in which the sugar percentage 
is hii!:h, and it is with these cases we have had particular success. 

The simplest way to use the l)eans is to cook tliem like the 
ordinary navy bean, pre]^aring either bean soup, boiled beans, 
or baked beans, the flavor usually being rather improved by the 
addition of a piece of fat salt meat. It is also a good ])lan to 
soak the beans for eight or ten hours, stir them up, and remove 
the rather firm envelope whicli encloses them, most of which 
will be found to come to the surface, from which they may be 
easily skimmed ofl'. The beans may be boiled and reduced to 
a smooth gruel and used in this way as a gruel, although this 
is rather a troublesome ])rocess ; or the beans may be thoroughly 
boiled and mashed and may be flavored with some other vege-

Company, Tappau, N. Y.) iu 1 (|uart of water for iifteeu

These gruels do not thicken duriui:: cookiuir, as they contain no 
starch, and readily settle on standing. This may be overcome by 
adding 1 to 2 heaping teaspoonsfuls of barley, oat, or wheat gruel 
flour before cooking, which will add O.G to \.'2 ])er c<'nt. starch to 
the gruels, and also slightly increase the ])ercentage of protein. 

Broths. — Add 1 to 8 ounces of t\w flour to 1 quart of beef, 
mutton, veal, or chicken broth and boil for fifteen minutes, add- 
ing water to make up for loss of eva])oration ; or, boil the same 
quantity of the soy flour for one hour with 1 (piart of water, 
to Avhich has been added a piece of ham, bacon, or sah pork to 
give flavor. Each ounce of the flour will add to the broth 
about 13 grams of protein and 120 calories, or in percentage 
add 1.4 ])er cent, protein, 0.60 })er cent, fat, and 0.:)0 per cent, 
carbohydrates. A broth made with 6 ounces of the soy flour 
to the quart woidd be half as rich in protein and fit as steak. 

Jluffiii''^- — I'o make muffins from the soy flour, take 1] tea- 
cupfuls of the soy floiu', \ teacupful of wheat flour, \ teaspoon- 
fid of salt, 2 eggs, 1 teacupful of sweet milk, 2 rounded tea- 
spoonfids of baking powder, and l!l tal)les}ioonfuls of melted 
but not hot butter, lieat well together, adding the meltcMl buttcT 
last, and bake in gem pans in a liot oven. This will make about 
12 muflins which will contain about loO grams of protein, and 
which will vield about 1<S0() calories, of which the eailx "hy- 
drates produce^ but 2S0. Inasmuch as the soy flour contains no 
starch, the addition of some wlu^it flour in making muflins is 
required. The mixture of wheat and soy Hour in this f )rninla 
Avill contain about .">6 ])er cent, protein and 20 j)er ceiu. carbo- 
hydrates, against 14 per cent, protein and (JO to 70 ju'r cent, 
carbohydrates in gluten flour. The proj)ortion of protein to 
carbohydrates is eight to ten times as large in the mixed soy 
and wheat flour as in the gluten flour. 

In addition to these methods, the following reci})e for nuiflins 
has been suggested by Dr. Skinner, of New Haven, Conn.: 



768 RECIPES. 

Soy bean flour, 1 J ciipfuls ; salt, | tcaspoonful ; baking powder, 
2 even teaspoonfnLs. Mix well and add 2 tablespoonfuls of 
cream which has first been thoroughly stirred into a cup of 
cold water. Add 2 eggs and beat together. Then add 2 table- 
s|)oonfuls of melted butter and beat the whole mixture well 
together. Bake fifteen minutes in a heated gem pan. The 
above makes 15 muffins. 

Another recipe for muffins is to beat up 3 eggs, add 1 cup of 
milk in which 1 grain of saccharin has been dissolved, and a 
lump of butter the size of an egg. Enough of the bean flour 
sliould be added to make a batter with ^ teaspoonful of baking 
])Owder. This should be baked in buttered muffin pans. 

Nat-cakes. — These may be made by using the above muffin 
recij)e as a basis and adding chopped nuts, almonds, or any 
other kind desired ; and the flour is improved by the addition 
of a small amount of spice. 

^oy Bean Calces. — Tliese may be made by taking 1 table- 
spoonful of cocoa, 1 teaspoonful of cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful of 
allspice, and chopped nuts, adding them to the batter as pre- 
pared for the muffins. 

Breakfast Food. — As a breakfast food it may be utilized by 
taking 1 cup of flour, enough milk or water to moisten it into 
a paste, a pinch of salt, and 1 grain of saccharin, which should 
be dissolved before adding. Boil one and a half hours in a 
double boiler and serve with rich cream. 

Pancakes. — These may be made by beating up 2 eggs with a 
pinch of salt, adding enough meal to make a batter, and -| tea- 
spoonful of baking powder. Tliis should be fried with butter 
and made into small cakes. 

Xoy Bean Cheese. — In China and Japan the bean is used 
ciiiefly in the form of a cheese-like substance, the most common 
forms of this being natto, tofu, miso, yuba, and shoyu. These 
cheeses are eaten daily by almost all the inliabitants of the 
East, but they are said to have a lack of flavor that renders 
them more or less unsuitcd for P]uropean and American palates. 
In Seattle, ^yash., and otlier places in the West we are informed 
that tofu is made by the Jaj)anese and sold to the Oriental resi- 
dents. We have not had any personal experience so far with the 
bean cheeses, although they are evidently very easy to maini- 
facture. One may be made from the gruel which resembles 
somewliat curds and whey, but which in the only form we liave 
tried is not sufficiently palatable for use, although very slight 
flavoring might make it a valuable food for American use.

The following suggestions for cooking the bean are made by 
Goff:i 

Grilled Soy Beans. — The beans may be grilled like chest- 
nuts, using the same method. If the beans are old and (hy 
they should be first soaked in warm water. 

Soy Beans with Buffer. — hat the beans soak in warm water 
until the hulls arc separated and float upon the sitrface, tiien 
let them strain for twenty-four hours, when they should be 
cooked, according to the age of the grains, from one to four 
hours, and seasoned to taste. They should tlien be strained 
again and served hot with butter on lettuce or romane. 

Soy Beans au Gras. — Place a chopped onion in a casserole of 
fat and fry it until the onion becomes brown. Then add the soy 
beans cooked as above, and allow them to cook a few minutes 
longer. 

Bread or Cakes of Soy Beans. — Triturate in a montar 250 
grams of soy flour with 2 fresh eggs and a large spoonful of 
milk. When this is perfectly mixed, add a pinch of baking 
powder, place in well-buttered molds, and cook from fifteen to 
twenty minutes. This may be flavored with vanilla, orange- 
flowers, or with pieces of citron. They may be divided into 
small cakes and then cooked in very small molds.

THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF AMERICAN 
FOOD MATERIALS. 

The material in this section has been taken from the re- 
vised edition of Bulletin No. 28 of the Experiment Stations 
of the Department of Agriculture of the United States. This 
very valuable bulletin was prepared by W. O. Atwater and A. 
P. Bryantj and represents the best compilation of analyses of 
American food materials down to 1899. Only the averages 
have been abstracted from the tables ; for ordinary purposes 
these will be found to be sufficient ; for the complete tables the 
reader should refer tx3 the original bulletin. 

The earliest quantitative food analyses were made in 1795 
by Pearson, in England, who analyzed potatoes. In 1805 
EinhofF analyzed potatoes and rye. Later other workers gave 
various accounts of their work, but the great impetus to the 
study of food materials was given by Liebig and his followers, 
whose work was done chiefly in the period between 1840 and 
1865. About 1864 Henneberg and his associates elaborated 
the so-called Weende method for proximate analysis. This 
method, with slight alterations, is used to-day wherever food 
analyses are made. *' The methods followed in different coun- 
tries agree so closely that for the last twenty years it has been 
possible to accept analyses by chemists in different parts of the 
w^orld and compare them with one another without hesitation " 
(Atwater and Bryant). Since the establishment of the experi- 
ment stations an enormous amount of work has been done. 
The results given in the tables (on pp. 779-805) show the 
averages of thousands of analyses ; these, together with the 
accompany inir list, have been taken directly from Atwater and 
Bryant's publication. 

EXPLANATION OF TERMS; 

The terms used in re])()rtiiig analyses of foods and feeding- 
stuffs need some explanation. Some of these terms liave a 
technical meaning which is well recognized and understood by 
' Those definitions are (jiK.ted from Atwater and I'.rvant.

scientists, althouij^h tli(' dictionaries and similar hooks of refer- 
ence have not yet included these uses in their delinitions. In 
other cases the Siune word has heen used l>y scientists in difler- 
ent ways. The more usual terms are detincd :iiid (.'Xj)lained 
below in the sense in which tluy are employed in the follo\\intr 
table and the publications oi" the Kxperiment Stations of the 
United States De}xirtment of A<;rieulture. 

COMPOSITION OF FOOD MATERIALS. 

Ordinary food materials, such as meat, fish, <\ii,lis, potatoes, 
wheat, etc., consist of : 

.Refuse. — As the bones of meat and fish, shells oi' .-hcllfish, 
skin of potatoes, bnin of wheat, etc. 

Edible Portion. — As tlie flesh of meat and fish, the white and 
yolk of eggs, wheat flour, etc. This edible portion eon.-i>t.- of 
water (usually incorporated in the tissue and n(»t visible as 
such), and nutritive ingredients or nutrients. 

The principal kinds of nutritive ingredients are protein, fats, 
carbohydrates, and ash or mineral matters. 

The water and refuse of various foods and the salt of salted 
meat and fish are called non-nutrients. In comparing the values 
of different food materials for nourishment tluy are left out of 
account. 

Protein. — This term is used to include nominally the total 
nitrogenous substance of animal and veiretable food materials, 
exclusive of the so-called nitrogenous fats. Actually it is 
employed, in common usage, to designate the ])roduet of the 
total nitrogen by an em])irieal factor, generally ().-!o. 

This total nitro<»:enous substance consists of a <j:reat varietv 
of chemical compounds, which are conveniently divided into 
two principal classes, proteids and non-prot(Mds. 

The term proteid, as here em])loy(Ml, includes: (1) The 
simple ])rotelds, e. //., albuminoids, globulins, and their deriva- 
tives, such as acid and alkali albumins, coagulated proteids, 
proteoses, and peptones; (!2) the so-called combined or com- 
pound ])roteids ; and (.'5) the so-called gelatinoids (sometimes 
called '' glutinoids ") M'hich are characteristic of animal connec- 
tive tissue. 

The term all)nminoids has long l)een used by Kui-opean and 
American chemists and physiologists as a collective designation 
for the substances of the first two grou])s, though many apply 
it to all three of these groups. Of late a number of investi- 



772 CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF AMERICAN FOODS. 

gators and writers have employed it as a special designation for 
compounds of the third class/ 

The term non-proteid is here used synonymously with non- 
albuminoid, and includes nitrogenous animal and vegetable 
compounds of simpler constitution than the proteids. The 
most important animal compounds of this class are the so-called 
^^ nitrogenous extractives '^ of muscular and connective tissue, 
such as creatin, creatiniu, xanthin, hypoxanthin, and allied 
cleavage products of the proteids. To some of these the term 
^^meat bases" has been applied. The latter, with certain 
mineral salts (potassium phosphates, etc.), are the most import- 
ant constituents of beef-tea and many commercial " meat 
extracts." 

The non-proteid nitrogenous compounds in vegetable foods 
consist of amids and amido acids, of which asparagin ai^d 
aspartic acid are familiar examples. 

The ideal method of analysis of food materials would involve 
quantitative determinations of the amounts of each of the 
several kinds or groups of nitrogenous compounds. This, how- 
ever, is seldom attempted. The common practice is to multiply 
the percentage of nitrogen by the factor 6.25 and take the prod- 
uct as representing the total nitrogenous substance. For many 
materials, animal and vegetable, this factor would be nearly 
correct for the proteids, which contain, on the average, not far 
from 16 per cent, of nitrogen, although the nitrogen content of 
the individual proteids is quite varied. The variations in the 
nitrogen of the non-proteids are wider, and they contain, on 
the average, more than 16 })er cent, of nitrogen. It is evident, 
therefore, that the computation of the total nitrogenous sub- 
stance in this way is l)y no means correct. In the flesh of 
meats and fish, wliich contain very little of carbohydrates, the 
nitrogenous substance is frequently estimated by difference — /. e.^ 
by subtracting the ether extract and ash from the total water- 
free substance. While this method is not always correct, it is 
oftentimes more nearly so tlian the determination by use of the 
usual factor. 

The distinction ])etween protein and proteids is thus very 
sharp. The latter are definite chemi(;al (;()m])()unds, while the 
former is an entirely arbitrary term used to designate a group 
which is (lommoiily assumed to include all of the nitrogenous 
matter of the food exce])t tlu^ nitrogenous fats.

given. Where the ])roteI(l and noii-|)rotei<l nitrogenons matter 
have been estimated in a food material the propoilions are indi- 
cated in a footnote. 

Fat^. — Under fats is included the total . etlusr extract. 
Familiar examples of fat are lat of meat, fat of milk (butter), 
oil of corn, dlive oil, etc. The ingnnlicnts of the ''ether 
extract" of animal and vegetal)le foods and fee<ling-stuifs, 
which it is customary to group roughly as fats, include Avith the 
true fats various other substances, as fatty acids, lecithins (nitrog- 
enous fats), and chloro])hylls. 

Carhohydrate^s. — Carbohydrates are usually determined by 
difference. They include sugars, starches, cellulose, gums, 
woody fiber, etc. In many instances separate determinations 
of one or more of these groups have been made. The deter- 
minations of "fiber^^ in vegetable foods — i. c, substances allied 
to carbohydrates but insoluble in dilute acid and alkali, and some- 
what similar to woody fiber — are given in a se])arate column. 

The figures in parentheses in the crude-fiber column show 
the nnmber of analyses in which the fiber was determined. 
The figures for '' total carbohydrates " include the fiber, as well 
as sugars, starches, etc. AVhere the sugars or starches have 
been determined separately, footnotes are added giving the aver- 
aii:e results. 

Ash or Mineral Mcitcrn. — Lender this head are included 
phosphates, sulphates, chlorids, and other salts of ])()tassium, 
sodium, magnesium, and other metallic elements. Where 
analyses of the mineral matters have been found they ai'c added 
in tlie form of footnotes. These results usually giNc the per- 
centage com})osition of the ash as iiroduced by incineration 
rather than the ])roportions in which the diiferent mineral 
ingredients occur in the food material. 

Fuel-value. — ]>y fuel-value is meant the immber of calories 
of heat equivalent to the energy which it is assumed the body 
would be able to obtain from one ])ound of a given food material, 
provided the nutrients of the latter were completely digested. 
The fuel values of the different food materials are calculated by 
use of the factors of ]\ubner, which alhnv 4.1 calories for a 
gram of protein, the same for a gram of carbohydrates, and 9.3 
calories per gram of fats. These amounts correspond to 18.G 



774 CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF AMERICAN FOODS. 

calories of energy for each hundredth of a pound of protein and 
of carbohydrates, and 42.2 calories for each hundredth of a 
pound of tat in the given food material. In the following tables 
the fuel- value per pound has been calculated by use of these 
factors. In these calculations the values of protein by factor 
have been used in all cases with the exception of salt cod and 
hen's eggs, in which the value of protein by difference was used. 

CUTS OF MEAT. 

The methods of cutting sides of beef, veal, mutton, and 
pork into parts, and the terms used for the different ^' cuts," 
as these parts are commonly called, vary in different localities. 
The analyses here reported apply to cuts as indicated by the 
following diagrams. These show the positions of the differ- 
ent cuts, both in the live animal and in the dressed carcass as 
found in the markets. The lines of division between the dif- 
ferent cuts will vary slightly, according to the usage of the 
local market, even where the general method of cutting is as 
here indicated. The names of the same cuts likewise vary in 
different parts of the country. 

The Cuts of Beef. — The general method of cutting up a side 
of beef is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows the relative posi- 
tion of the cuts in the animal and in a dressed side. The neck 
piece is frequently cut so as to include more of the chuck than 
is represented by the diagrams. The shoulder clod is usually 
cut without bone, while the shoulder (not indicated in diagram) 
would include more or less of the shoulder-blade and of the 
upper end of the fore shank. Shoulder steak is cut from the 
chuck. In many localities the })late is made to include all the 
parts of the fore-quarter designated on the diagrams as brisket, 
cross-ri})s, plate and navel, and different portions of the plate, 
as thus cut, are spoken of as the " brisket end of plate '^ and 
^^ navel end of plate." This part of the animal is largely used 
for corning. The ribs are frequently divided into first, second, 
and third cuts, the latter lying nearest the chuck and being 
slightly less desirable tliMn the former. The chuck is some- 
times subdivided in a similar manner, the third cut of the 
chuck being near(^st the neck. The names applied to different 
portions of tlu; loin vary considerably in different localities. 
The part nearest the ribs is fre(]uently called '^ small end of 
loin" or "short steak." The other end of the loin is called 
''hip sirloin" or "sirloin." J>etween the short and the sirloin 



CUTS OF MEAT. 




is a portion quite generally called the " tenderloin,'' for tte 
reason that the real tenderloin, the very tender strip of meat 
lying inside the loin, is found most 
fully developed in this cut. Por- 
terhouse steak is a term most fre- 
quently applied to either the short 
steak or the tenderloin. It is not 
uncommon to find the flank cut so 
as to include more of the loin than 
is indicated in the figures, in which 
case the u]->per portion is called ^' flank 
steak." The larger part of the flank 
is, however, very frequently corned, 
as is also the case with the rum]). 
In some markets the rump is cut so 
as to include a ])orti()n of the loin, 
which is then sold as '" rump steak." 
The portion of the round on the in- 
side of tlie log is regarded as more 
tender than that on the outside, and 
is frequently })rel('rrc(l to the latter. 
As the leg lies upon the butcher's

table this inside of the round is usually on the upper or top 
side, and is therefore called " top round/' Occasionally the 
plate is called the " rattle.^' 

The Cuts of Veal. — The method of cutting up a side of veal 
differs considerably from that employed with beef This is 
illustrated by Fig. 3, which shows the relative position of the 
cuts in the animal and in a dressed side. The chuck is much 
smaller in proportion, and frequently no distinction is made 
between the chuck and the neck. The chuck is often cut so 
as to include considerable of the portion here designated ae 
shoulder, following more nearly the 
method adopted for subdividing beef. 
The shoulder of veal as here indicated 
includes, besides the portion corresponding 
to the shoulder in beef, the larger part of 
what is here classed as chuck in the adult

into pieces suitable for frying or boiling. The chuck and ribs 
are sometimes called the '' rack." 

The Cuts of Pork. — The method of cutting up a side of pork 
differs considerably from that employed with other meats. A 
large portion of the carcass of a dressed ])ig consists of almost 
clear fat. This furnishes the cuts which are used i'or '' salt 
pork " and bacon. Fig. 5 illustrates a common method of cut- 
ting up Y>ovk, showing the relative position of the cuts in the 
animal and in the dressed side. The cut desiirnated as " back

cut '' is almost clear fat, and is used for salting and pickling. 
The " middle cut " is the portion quite generally used for bacon

ment Stations, United States Department of Agriculture.) 



and for 
or may 



^' lean ends '^ salt pork. The belly is salted or pickled 

be made into sausages. 

Beneath the ^' back cut " are the ribs 
and loin, from which are obtained 
'' spareribs/' " chops/' and roasting 
pieces, here designated by dotted lines. 
The hams and shoulders are more fre- 
quently cured, but are also sold as fresh 
pork " steak." The tenderloin proper 
is a comparatively lean and very small 
strip of meat lying under the bones of 
the loin and usually weighing a frac- 
tion of a pound. Some fat is usually 
trimmed oflpfrom the hams and shoulders, 
which is called " ham and shoulder fat," 
and is often used for sausages, etc. What 
is called " leaf lard," at least in some lo- 
calities, comes from the inside of the back. 
It is the kidney fat. 

As stat(Ml above, cuts as shown in the 
dlngrams herewith corresj)on(l to tiiose 
of which analyses are re])orted in the 
ta})l(\s beyond, but do not attemj)t to 
show the different methods of cutting 
in markets in diilcrcnt parts of the United States.

1 Fruits contain a certain proportion of inedible materials, as skin, seeds, etc., 
which are properly classed as refuse. In some fruits, as oranges and prunes, tlie 
amount rejected in eating is practically the same as the refuse. In others, as apples 
and pears, more or less of the edible m'aterial is ordinarily rejected with the skin and 
seeds and other inedible portions. The edible material which is thus thrown away, 
and should properly be classed with the waste, is here classed with the refuse. The 
figures for refuse here given represent, as nearly as can be ascertained, the quantities 
ordinarily rejected.

Do not wean the baby in hot weather. 

Ilemember that ten l)ottle babies die to one tliat is breast fed. 

One-third of the deaths of infants and yonng children occur 
diirin<i: the hot summer months. 

Heat kills the baby chiefly by s])oiling the milk given it. 

Nurse the bal)y regularly, not oftener than two hours during 
tlie day and four hours at night. 

Do not nurse the baby every time it cries. 

li' you cannot nurse your baby^ consult your doctor before 
giving it the bottle. 

FrcnJi Air. — Give the baby fresh air day aijd night. 

Keep the windows open all day and all night. 

Keej) the baby out of doors as much as you can. 

The out-door air is better for the baby than that of the house. 

The air in the scpiares and parks is better than that of the 
streets. 

Keep the rooms clean. 

Do not let garl)age, slop, or dirty clothes stand about the room. 

Sh'cj). — Do not let the baby sleep in the same bed with any 
other person.

and not so nnich food. 



THE BOTTLE-FED BABY. 819 

Give a few teuspooni'uls of pure boiled water several times a 
(lay. 

Summer diarrhea is caused by spoiled milk or other food, bad 
air, dirt, and too much clothiuir, too much handiinu', too little 
sleep, too little water. 

If the baby vomits or has loosc^ bowels, stop all ibod and give 
plain boiled water until you have seen your doctor. 

Do not drug the baby. If your baby is sick send for a doctor 
or take it to a hospital or dis})ensary. 

Do not ask your neighbors' advice about your baby, ask your 
doctor. 

THE BOTTLE-FED BABY. 

The Bottlea. — I^se a common round-bottomed bottle; boil or 
scald it each time before ])utting the baby's milk in it. 

The Nipples. — Use plain black rubber nip])les. Boil them 
once a day. Wash the nipples before and after each feeding. 
When not in use keep the nipples in a covered glass fdled with 
water in W'hich you have put a pinch of baking soda or borax. 

Never use a nipple with a tube to it. 

Tlie 3IilJ:.— Get only the best milk for the baby. Better ]my 
more for milk and save doctor bills, and possibly funeral ex- 
penses. It costs less to buy a baby good milk for a year than 
to bury it. 

The best milk is bottled at the dairy and delivered in bc>ttles. 
Milk sold from the can is apt to be dirty and unfit for use. ]\Iilk 
in summer from an open can in a shop is never tit to give a baby. 

Milk from a herd is better than milk from one cow. 

To Keep Milk. — Take it in as soon as delivered. As soon as 
possible mix the baby's milk. Place this in clean bottles and 
stopper with raw^ cotton. 

Keep the milk cold — on ice if possible. If you have no ice, 
wrap a cloth wrung out in cold water about the bottles. 

If you have difhculty in keeping milk, bring it to a boil as 
soon as it is delivered to you. 

Keep the things for the bal)y's milk separate. 

Keep the things clean. 

Scald them with boiling water before using.
