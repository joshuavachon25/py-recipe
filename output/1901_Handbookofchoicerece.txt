The receipts in this compilation have, except in a few 
instances, never before been published. They have been 
contributed by the managers and friends of the Brooklyn 
Home for Consumptives, and by. Hfe-long friends of the 
Editor. She wishes to take this opportunity to thank all 
who have so kindly responded to her request for their 
treasured receipts, which have been culled from a wealth 
of material, in many instances handed down through gener- 
ations from the grandmothers of colonial days to their 
descendants, whose fondness for the old time dainties 
serves to keep alive their interest in the kitchen and its 

accessories.

WATER MUFFINS. 

(These muflBns are made of the whole wheat Flour, 
Franklin Mills, and are most wholesome and delicate.) 

Butter a set of iron gem pans which have been set on the 
range and are mad hot ! Mix i J4 cups of the whole wheat 
flour with enough water to make a rather thin batter ; beat 
up thoroughly and pour it, or spoon it into the well buttered 
and very hot gem pans ; set in hot oven. They will rise in 
about twenty minutes or less. Serve at once. They should 
be as light as pop-overs. Pull open and butter generously. 
Be sure you do not try to improve on the receipt by adding 



a little salt, as the result will be failure. It is the exceed- 
ing heat of the pans and oven which causes them to rise ; a 
little salt can be sprinkled on with the butter if considered 
an improvement. 

Mrs. E. F. McCoy.

Pour absolutely boiling water over all till of right con- 
sistency, not enough to make it smooth or to drop from

about a tablespoon at a time by pushing from spoon with a 
knife. They must not look flat and smooth like pancakes, 
but must be thicker and rough and take longer to cook. 
Fry a beautiful brown on one side and turn ; keep adding 
fat as it cooks away. Very delicious if just right, but difl&- 
cult to write receipt for, since as much depends on manipu- 
lation as ingredients.

SOUPS. 



CLAM SOUP. 

" First catch your clams — along the ebbing edges 
Of saline coves 3^011 '11 find the precious wedges 
With backs up, lurking in the sandy bottom ; 
Pull in your rake, and lo ! you've got 'em. 
Take thirty large ones, put a basin under. 
And cleave with knife, their stony jaws asunder. 
Add water (three quarts) to the native liquor. 
Bring to a boil, and, by the way, the quicker 
It boils the better, if you do it cutely. 
Now add the clams chopped up and minced minutely. 
Allow a longer boil of just three minutes. 
And, while it bubbles, quickly stir within its 
Tumultuous depths, where still the mollusks mutter, 
Four tablespoons of flour and four of butter ; 
A pint of milk, some pepper to your notion, 
And clams need salting, although born of ocean. 
Remove from fire, if much boiled they will suffer. 
You'll find that India rubber isn't tougher ; 
After this add three fresh eggs, well beaten. 
Stir once more and its ready to be eaten. 
Fruit of the wave ! O, dainty and delicious ! 
Food for the gods ! Ambrosia for Apicius ! 
Worthy to thrill the soul of sea-born venus. 
Or titillate the palate of Silenus !"

SALAD. 



A RECEIPT FOR SALAD. 

" To make this condiment your poet begs 

The pounded yellow of two hard boiled eggs ; 
Two boiled potatoes, passed through kitchen sieve, 
Smoothness and softness to the salad give ; 
lyCt onion atoms lurk within the bowl, 
And, half suspected, animate the whole ; 
Of mordent mustard, add a single spoon, 
Distrust the condiment that bites so soon. 
But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault 
To add a double quantity of salt ; 
Four times the spoon with oil from Lucca crown, 
And twice with vinegar, procured from town ; 

35 



And lastly, o'er the flavored compound toss 

A magic soupgon of ancovy sauce. 

O green and glorious ! O herbaceous treat ! 

'Twould tempt the d3ang anchorite to eat ; 

Back to the world he'd turn his fleeting soul, 

And plunge his fingers in the salad bowl. 

Serenely full, the epicure would say, 

" Fate cannot harm me — I have dined to-day." 

Sidney Smith. 

POTATO SALAD. 

Boil 8 large potatoes with skins on ; when soft, peel, cut 
.small and add chopped celery or onions ; mix with potatoes

PIES. 



TO KAKE AN AIIBLONGTTS PIE. 

Take 4 pounds, say 4>^ pounds, of fresh Amblongusses 
and put them in a small pipkin, cover them with water and 
boil them 8 hours incessantly ; after which add 2 pints of new 
milk, and proceed to boil for 4 hours more. When you 
have ascertained that the Amblongusses are quite soft, take 

58 



them out and place them iu a wide pan, taking care to 
shake them well previously. Grate some nutmeg over the 
surface and cover them carefully with powdered gingerbread, 
curry-powder, and a sufficient quantity of cayenne pepper. 
Remove the pan into the next room, and place it on the 
floor. Bring it back again, and let it simmer three-quarters 
of an hour. Shake the pan violently till all the Amblon- 
gusses have become of a pale purple color. Then having 
prepared the paste, insert the whole carefully ; adding at 
the same time a small pigeon, 2 slices of beef, 4 cauliflowers 
and any number of oysters. Watch patiently till the crust 
begins to rise, and add a pinch of salt from time to time. 
Serve up in a clean dish and throw the whole out of win- 
dow as fast as possible. 

We insert the above receipt for pie from Edward I,ear's 
" Nonsense Cookery," venturing to hope, if the receipts for 
pie following this are carefully used, the pies resulting will 
escape the fate of the Amblongusses.
