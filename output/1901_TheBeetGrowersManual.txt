The growing interest manifested in the development of the Beet Sugar Industry 
and the rapid strides this new and promising industry has made within the past few 
years leave no room for doubt that it has come to stay with us. 

The permanent establishment of the industry will call for reference books, and 
"The Beet Grower's Manual and Text Book for the Investor in Beet Sugar 
Enterprises" was written in the hope that it might prove a valuable help to those on 
whom the industry depends in the first place, viz: The farmers raising the beets, and the 
capitalists furnishing the money for the building of factories. 

I have divided the book into three parts: The first part being devoted to a brief 
record of the history of the beet sugar industry in Europe ; its rise and progress in the 
United States and its economic features. The second part deals exclusively with beet 
culture. While beet raising has not come to us as an untried experiment, it is an entirely 
new interprise for most of our farmers. To make a success of it, it is necessary that 
every factor entering into it be given careful consideration and attention. I have en- 
deavored to give under this heading what I consider the most practical and accurate 
methods for raising beets, avoiding detail of a too scientific nature, the book being 
primarily intended for the novice in the field. However, I trust that it will also prove of 
interest to the experienced beet farmer, agriculturists and factory owners. 

Part three contains a short description of the process of Sugar making, hints how to 
secure and build a sugar factory and other information of interest to the investor in beet 
sugar enterprises. 

The datas are from many sources, the principal ones being publications by the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture and State Experiment Stations, The Weekly Statistical 
Sugar Trade Journal, and others. As is to be expected in a compilation of data of this 
character from miscellaneous sources, the figures presented do not always fully agree, 
but in no instance is there a serious discrepancy. 

The Appendix contains a Directory, the object of which is to furnish the very best 
sources for purchasing sugar and other machinery, beetfarming tools and other articles 
and materials used in field and factory.

PART I. 

History of Beet Sugar in Europe. Rise and Progress of the Beet 
Sugar Industry in the United States. 



INTRODUCTORY. 

The growth of the Beet Sugar Industry during the last decade, 
particularly during the last couple of years, is one of the wonders that 
have astounded the agricultural and commercial world on both sides of 
the ocean. At the beginning of the decade less than 2500 acres of 
sugar beets were raised, while to-day 100,000 acres are devoted to 
sugar beet culture. 

The late U. S. Senator Leland Stanford, one of the most enthusi- 
astic supporters of the beet sugar industry in its early stages in Cali- 
fornia, prophesied years ago that the present generation would see the 
homely old beet become a king of the agricultural domain, as potent as 
corn or cotton ever was. "The sugar beet is the hope of American 
agriculture" he once wrote, and never a truer word was spoken. 
Whether this prophesy shall become true rests with the American 
farmer, and I think he may be depended upon in this respect. There 
is no branch of agriculture at the present day receiving so much atten- 
tion from agricultural economists and progressive farmers in the United 
States as that of sugar beet growing. This is but natural when we con- 
sider that the comsumption of sugar is rapidly increasing in this coun- 
try and that during the last five years it has taken three-fourths and 
more of the money received from exported wheat and flour to pay for 
the sugar imported during the same period. The sharp competition 
from countries having cheap lands and cheap labor has so reduced the 
price of wheat and other farm products, as to make it necessary to replace 
grain growing to a certain extent by a more intense system of farming, 
such as growing sugar beets for the production of sugar. 

In view of these conditions and considering that no other country 
on earth is more favored by its natural resources to produce one of the 
most important articles of daily consumption, it must be regarded as 

5 



peculiarly proper that public attention is turning more and more seri- 
ously toward the question, whether with intelligent management the 
raising of sugar beets and the production of sugar therefrom can be made a 
fixed feature in our agricultural and industrial systems, as it has become 
in many countries in Europe. 

In Europe to-day sugar beet raising and beet sugar manufacture 
is a decided success. In Germany, Austria, France especially the 
cultivation of sugar beets has produced an enormous boom and devel- 
oped into gigantic dimensions. 

The highly prosperous condition of the farmers in the beet sugar 
producing districts in Europe is the most convincing proof of the 
beneficial consequences which followed the introduction of beet culture 
everywhere. 

Whatever difference of opinion there may have existed at various 
times regarding the feasibility of establishing the industry as a mere in- 
dustrial enterprise, there can be no doubt that sugar beet culture has 
always proven an invigorating stimulant to agriculture, introducing 
sound principles into agricultural methods and pursuits, a more rational, 
practical and scientific rotation of crops, thereby increasing crops of 
all kinds and producing larger quantities of fodder and meat. But it 
has also brought about and promoted a healthy feeling of mutual interest 
between farmer and manufacturer, between capital and labor. 

European agriculturists, however, only accomplished this union 
of industrial and agricultural interests by devoting themselves with al- 
most unrivaled perseverance to the task of producing a sugar beet of 
the highest standard of quality, containing the largest possible amount 
of sugar in the most favorable condition of extraction. 

It is no longer a problem whether beet sugar manufacture can suc- 
ceed in this country, and the question, is there money in beet raising 
and sugar making, has been answered in no uncertain manner by the 
results which were produced through the introduction of the industry in 
such localities as have now sugar factories. 

Since the history of the industry in Europe offers so many points of 
comparison and in many instances represents the exact counterpart of 
the various stages of development in this country, I have thought it ad- 
visable to preface the subject proper by a short synopsis of the history 
of the industry in Europe. 

HISTORY OF BEET SUGAR IN EUROPE. 

On the 11th of January, 1899, the beet sugar industry celebrated its 
100th anniversary in Germany, the land of its cradle, from whence it 
spread in a comparatively short time all over Europe, developing into 
a most wonderful industrial power. More correctly the birth of the beet 
sugar industry dates back to the year 1V47, when the German chemist 
Margraf published the results of his investigations regarding the avail- 

6 



ability of certain beet varieties as sugar producers. He produced sugar 
from beets in a limited way by laboratory experiments. However, his 
work did not lead to any practical results and the matter lay dormant 
for half a century It was left to Franz Carl Achard, Director of the 
Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences, and a pupil of Margraf, to repeat 
and expand Margraf's investigations, and to demonstrate not only the 
presence of crystalline sugar in certain beets, but also the feasibility to 
extract this sugar on a paying scale Achard therefore may be justly 
called the father of the industry which has proven of such immense 
value to the agricultural and industrial interests of all beet-growing 
countries. 

One may well doubt that Achard, when one hundred years ago 
making his report to King Frederick William III. concerning the ex- 
traction of sugar from beets, ever supposed that his efforts were laying 
the cornerstone of an industry of its presents magnitude. A chard's 
report resulted in a government order that beets should be raised in 
large quantities in all provinces, and the establishment in 1799 of the 
first beet sugar factory at Kunern, in Lower Silesia. Up to the time of 
Achard's invention sugar had always been very expensive. The pos- 
session of sugar in the Middle Ages signified a princely fortune. At 
Achard's time one pound of sugar cost from $1.50 to $2.00. Still 
Achard's efforts might have proved fruitless, as the cost of production 
was considerably in excess of the price of the sugar, had it not been 
for Napoleon I. 

NAPOLEON I/S INTEREST IN BEET SUGAR. 

In order to cripple and destroy English commerce Napoleon 
ordered and maintained a blockade of continental ports against English 
colonial products. European ocean traffic was thus interrupted, that 
sugar cargoes reached their destination only at great hazards. Sugar 
prices advanced exhorbitantly, which gave a fresh stimulus to the erec- 
tion of additional factories in Saxony, Silesia, Bohemia, Austria and 
especially in Belgium and France. On March 25th, 1811, Napoleon 
issued his first decree for the encouragement of the beet sugar industry, 
setting aside lands for the culture of beets and establishing schools for 
the study of beet sugar chemistry, appropriating $200,000 for this work. 
Further decrees carried additional subsidies and by their aid the beet 
sugar industry made rapid strides both in Germany and in France. The 
success of the continental factories and their threatening competition 
with colonial sugar, England's monopoly, spread great alarm among 
the English importers and large sums of money were offered to Achard 
in order to induce him to repudiate his invention. They wanted him to 
publish a work, stating that his enthusiasm for beet sugar had deceived 
him, and that his experiments on a large scale had convinced him that 
beet sugar could never replace cane sugar. They are said to have 

7 



offered him at first 50,000 Thalers, and later on 200,000 Thalers, 
but he refused to retract. Neither threats, blandishments nor bribes 
availed with him. The English importers, aided by the English colo- 
nial office, left nothing untried in their efforts to kill the industry in the 
bud. But all their intrigues were unsuccessful. They went thus far, 
as to induce the best known savants of the day, even such a man as Sir 
Humphrey Davy, to write treatises in which the new invention was 
ridiculed, the product decried and the .most direful results predicted. 

"Verily, history repeats itself, it is a wise teacher, and wise people 
will ponder over its lessons and read wisdom therefrom!" May not the 
pioneers of the beet sugar industry in our country be encouraged, and 
justly so, by Achard's example? 

Altough in very slow stages, the beet sugar industry worked ahead. 
In the early days the product amounted to but 2 to 3 per cent, of the 
original weight of the beets, but the factories soon stood on a paying 
basis, owing to the high price of the product. This was especially the 
case in France, where under the powerful patronage of Napoleon the 
industry made rapid strides. After the downfall of Napoleon and the 
removal of the continental blockade the beet sugar industry in Germany, 
owing to the renewed competition of colonial sugar, became less 
prosperous, in fact, most of the sugar factories in Germany were ruined. 

TEMPORARY DECLINE OF THE INDUSTRY 
IN GERMANY. 

Colonial sugars, under a heavy and constantly increasing influx of 
shipments from the tropics, became cheaper and cheaper, and notwith- 
standing the improvement in the chemical, technical and mechanical 
branches of the beet sugar manufacture, the return was still so limited 
that the German beet sugar manufacturers were unable to cope with the 
colonial competitor. They lost money, and as a consequence many 
factories closed down for good. 

FRANCE, THE CHIEF NURSERY OF THE INDUSTRY 
FROM J8J2 TO J835. 

In France, partly owing to improved methods of manufacture de- 
vised by French chemists, and partly as a consequense of the natural 
antipathy to England and English products, the industry continued to 
prosper in a measure, and from 1812 to 1836 France was the chief nurs- 
ery of the industry. In 1828 there were already 103 beet sugar factories 
in operation in France. Constant and diligent study resulted in 
simplifying and improving the process of manufacture and increasing 
the percentage of refined sugar originally obtained from the raw 
material. Instead of 2 to 3 per cent, as much as 5 and 6 per cent, was 
obtained, and the production of beet sugar rapidly increased, amount- 
ing to about 40,000 tons in 1835. 

8 



FRESH IMPETUS TO THE INDUSTRY 
IN GERMANY. 

In the meanwhile the industry had struggled along slowly in Ger- 
many, but in the early thirties it received a fresh impetus. In 1834 three 
men, Zier, Hanewald and Arnoldi, associated themselves in Quedlinburg 
for the purpose of building and starting sugar factories on a paying 
basis. This trio of promoters succeeded to allure by brilliant promises 
many capitalists of their day to invest money in the industry. They 
built quite a number of factories, but it is not recorded that a single 
one of them turned out a success. But this was not so much the fault 
of these early promoters of beet sugar enterprises, as owing to the fact 
that the chief principles of beet culture and the art of sugar-making 
were not as yet fully understood. 

Agricultural methods especially were as yet in a very primitive 
stage, and it proved especially difficult to obtain good beets. The sac- 
charometer having not yet been invented, it was almost impossible to 
tell good beets from poor ones. But both in field and laboratory im- 
provement followed upon improvement. 

One of the foremost champions of the industry, the chemist Franz 
Schatten, about this time constructed the first saccharometer for as- 
certaining the amount of sugar in beets, the principle of his apparatus 
being based upon the formation of lime sugar and the determination of 
sugar content by titration with acids. Of course, his apparatus is no 
longer in use, but in his time it was a great boom to the industry. 
Schatten also constructed the first apparatus for the examination of 
bone coal as to its contents of lime. His process of revitalizing bone 
coal and his furnaces are to this day in use in many sugar factories. 
The use of carbonic acid in treating the sugar juice is likewise one of 
Schatten's inventions, and to his zeal and genius the remarkable pro- 
gress of the sugar industry in Germany is mainly due. 

GERMANY TAKES THE LEAD AS BEET SUGAR 
PRODUCER. 

At the beginning of the forties Schatten and such men as Marker, 
Balling, Ring, Robert — who in 1837 built a factory at Gross-Sedowitz 
where he introduced the Robert evaporators and numerous other im- 
provements in manufacture — , Schulz, Schuetzenbach and others, by 
scientific researches and practical experiments had demonstrated the 
fact that from properly cultivated beets 6 to 8 per cent, refined sugar 
were obtainable. Schuetzenbach built in 1839 a factory at WaghSufel, 
in Baden, where he devised many improvements and where from that 
time on nearly all important inventions were tested. His sugar boxes, 
first brought out in 1841, are still in use in many factories. 

The high protective tariff which was placed at the time upon foreign 

9 



sugars served as a further incentive for the growth of the industry. 
Germany in one bound took the lead as the beet sugar producer of 
Europe and has held this place ever since, outdistancing all com- 
petitors. 

Aided by adequate legislation and the active interest by beet 
growers' and sugar manufacturers' associations, which were formed at 
that time and were very instrumental in improving field and factory 
work by the discussion of methods, new processes and inventions, and 
an interchange of opinions and experiences, within comparatively short 
time the industry assumed larger proportions until it became one of the 
most potent factors among the agricultural and manufacturing indus- 
tries of the land. 

According to the official "Statistical Year Book of the German 
Empire, XV. year," there were in operation :

From this it will be seen that while during the twenty years 
1873-74 to 1893-94 the number of factories only increased 19 per cent., 
the quantity of beets worked increased 178.1 percent. At the beginning 
of said period each factory worked up an average of 10,471 tons, while 
at the end already 24,466 tons were worked up by each factory. Still 
more important was the increase in the output of refined sugar. 

In 1873-74 the product amounted to 291,041 tons; in 1892-93 to 
1,175,137 tons, or four times the former amount; in 1873-74, 12,12 kilos, 
were required to produce 1 kilo, of sugar; in 1892-93 only 8,35 kilos, 
were required to produce 1 kilo of sugar.

These tables show several interesting facts, the most important of 
which, the increase in the yield of sugar, owing, of course, to the im- 
proved methods of beet culture, resulting in production of beets of 
higher sugar content, and the improvement in the process of sugar 
manufacture, enabling the manufacturer to extract a larger percentage 
of the sugar contained in the beet. In 1877-78 the total production of 
raw sugar amounted to 378,009 tons; in the campaign 1898-99 to 
1,710,000 tons, or four and one-half times the former amount. At the 
beginning of the stated period 10.82 tons of beets were required to pro- 
duce a ton of sugar, while in 1898-^99 only 7.1 tons of beets were 
required. In commenting on these tables, Chas F. Saylor, Special 
Agent of Department of Agriculture, and author of the government 
report referred to, states : 

"The decrease in the amount of beets required for a ton of sugar and 
increase of the amount of sugar in the beets, gradual in both cases, and de- 
cidedly marked in the extremes, illustrates very clearly the advantage of ex- 
perience both to manufacturing and sugar beet growing, and is due to two 
causes ; First, better methods of manufacture by which the factory is able 
to extract from the beet more of its sugar content ; and second, careful 
breeding and selecting of seed by which beets of high sugar content have 
been developed, and better methods of agriculture, by which the farmer is 
able to produce beets of better quality. This illustrates the point for which 
I have been contenting throughout this report, namely, that when the fac- 
tories and the farmers through experience shall have been able to discover 
and adopt the best methods, the cost of sugar production will gradually be- 
come less, as it has in every other country. It will be noticed in this con- 
nection, as a natural consequence that the amount of sugar received from 
a ton of beets has increased about one-third, while the price of sugar beets 
has gradually gone down. At the same time it will be noticed that the sell- 
ing price of raw and refined sugar has decreased in a more marked degree." 

Germany has now over 400 beet sugar factories contributing in 
round figures 2,000,000 tons — about three-quarters of which is exported 
to other countries — out of a total annual beet sugar production of 
5,300,000 tons, the latter representing two-thirds of all the sugar pro- 
duction in the world. Germany alone produces the amount equal to 
present total annual imports of sugar into the U. S. 

Other European beet raising countries show a similiar rapid pro- 
gress. A full statistical exhibit, while of interest, would transgress the 
scope of these pages, and I therefore confine myself to giving a few of 
the most important datas, touching on beet sugar production in the 
five beet sugar producing countries of Europe, ranking next to Ger- 
many, for the five seasons 1893-94 to 1897-98 :

From these figures the observant reader may form some conclu- 
sions as to what the industry will amount to in the United States when 
established on a scale to produce all the sugar required for home con- 
sumption. 

Perhaps the best demonstration of the importance of the beet sugar 
industry is presented by the fact that after its few decades of existence 
in Germany and comparatively small sacrifice by the government and 
private individuals it is now able to pay $33,000,000 annually in taxes 
to the state. Large as this sum may appear, it is nothing compared 
to the wealth the industry has brought to the nation. 

18 



In concluding this short review of the history of beet sugar in the 
Old World, mention must be made that the industry is now making 
rapid progress in many countries where it has been newly introduced. 
In Spain, the beet sugar industry has developed with great rapidity 
during the last few years, likewise in Sweden. Bulgaria, Servia, Rou- 
mania, Italy, Switzerland and Greece are emulating the example set by 
other nations of Europe, and considerable attention is being paid to 
beet culture, and efforts are being made to establish the beet sugar in- 
dustry in Egypt, Persia and Chili. 

HISTORY OF THE INDUSTRY IN THE 
UNITED STATES. 

The first beginnings in raising and cultivating sugar beets in this 
country date back into the thirties of last century, just the time when 
the industry, which up till then, as related in the preceeding pages, had 
been struggling along slowly in most of the European beet raising 
countries, underwent there a strong revival. In Germany, Belgium and 
Austria many new factories were started, and in France particularly, 
which at that time, as already mentioned, was the chief nursery of the 
industry, through Dubrunfant, Biot and other celebrated chemists 
numerous improvements resulting in simplifying and improving the 
process of manufacture and increasing the percentage of refined sugar 
originally obtained from the beets, were introduced in the existing 
factories. 

No doubt the increased attention and the growing success of the 
industry in Europe induced the first attempts in beet culture and the 
manufacture of beet sugar in this country. To the Society of Shakers 
at Ensfield, near Philadelphia, and to John Massey in Illinois belongs 
the credit of having first introduced beet culture in the United States. 
Their efforts, however, were limited in the main to the raising of beets, 
and up to 1837 manufacture of sugar was attempted only in an experi- 
mental way, without leading to practical results. In 1838 Dav. L. 
Child, who in 1840 published a book on the culture of beets and the 
manufacture of beet sugar, organized the Northampton Beet Sugar 
Company, at Northampton, Mass., and located a factory in the state of 
Connecticut. His method consisted in drying the beets and then ex- 
tracting the sugar therefrom. It was not a brilliant success, and only 
about 1300 pounds of sugar were made in this way, at an estimated 
cost of 11 cents per pound. He extracted from the beets 6 per cent, of 
sugar and 2^ per cent, of molasses, and made the cost of culture 
$42.00 per acre, with an average yield of 13 to 15 tons of beets. 

There was then an interim until 1863 when two Germans, the 
Gennert Brothers, experts from Brunswick, Germany, established a 
factory at Chatsworth, 111., 100 miles south of Chicago, under the name 

14 



of the Germania Beet Sugar Co. Machinery for the plant was imported 
from Europe, upon which a heavy duty was paid. The factory had 
about 10,000 acres under cultivation, and during the early years Sj^ per 
cent, of sugar was obtained, and later under new. management the 
amount increased to 5^ per cent. Outside of the small percentage of 
sugar obtained from the beets at the start, a number of causes, such as 
bad culture in 1868, deluging rains in 1869, drought in 1870, and gener- 
ally a lack of sufficient labor at the right time, contributed to the 
failure of the enterprise, which, however, was doomed from the begin- 
ning, as the location was badly chosen. In the first place the soil was 
ill adapted for beet culture ; secondly, unfavorable climatic conditions 
and particularly scarcity of water proved a serious obstacle to success, 
and after struggling along for six years the undertaking collapsed. In 
1871 the plant was removed to Freeport, 111., where the soil was better, 
but other conditions were just as unfavorable, so that at the end of the year 
the Germania Beet Sugar Co went out of existence, having sunk, it is 
said, about $300,000 in the attempt to establish the industry. The 
Gennert Brothers in 1870 started another plant at Black Hawk, Wis., 
but it failed also, owing to the fact that the farmers did not raise beets 
in sufficient quantities to keep the factory properly supplied. From 
Black Hawk part of the machinery was removed to California. Thus 
the industry during the first forty years of its history in this country 
proved a complete failure. 

The first successful undertaking was that by Bonesteel & Otto, two 
German experts who about 1868 organized a company with a capital of 
$12,000, which operated a small factory at Fond du Lac, Wis. 

In 1869 Bonesteel & Otto with others organized the California Beet 
Sugar Co., capitalized at $250,000. The factory was built in 1870, at 
Alvarado, with machinery from the dismantled Illinois and Wisconsin 
factories, and Bonesteel & Otto took charge of the new factory, aban- 
doning their works at Fond du Lac. 

Subsequently Mr. Otto went to Santa Cruz County, Cal., where he 
operated a factory until 1876. The Alvarado company failed in that 
year but was reorganized in 1879 and has been in continued operation 
ever since. 

Various efforts during the late 70's to establish the industry in the 
states of Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts and New Jersey proved also 
unsuccessful. In 1876-77 Delaware appropriated money for premiums 
amounting in the two years to $1800. The result was the establishment 
of a sugar factory at Wilmington, which, however, proved a financial 
loss. The company which was organized April 1, 1879, under the name 
of The Delaware Beet Sugar ManufacturingCo. , had amongst its directors 
some of the most influential men of the state. As stated in a Wilmington 
paper, the directors did not deem it necessary to built their factory, until 
the first crop of beets was raised. It was further stated that the company 

15 



intended manufacturing sugar from dried beets, using only such green 
beets as might be grown contiguous to the factory. It is certainly not 
to be wondered at that the enterprise turned out a failure. 

In 1870 the Massachusetts legislature exempted from taxation for 
ten years all capital and property engaged in the beet sugar industry, 
and subsequently granted a bounty of 1 cent per pound on all sugar 
produced. The Franklin Sugar Refining Co. was organized in 1879 at 
Franklin, Mass., with ^75,000 capital, and it furnished seed to the 
farmers under contract to cultivate a certain number of acres. The 
farmers paid but little attention to the culture, and what beets they did 
raise, were worth more for feeding to cattle than the factory could 
afford to pay: consequently in a short time the company failed. 

The state legislature of Maine in 1877 offered a bounty of 1 cent 
per pound for the manufacture of sugar from beets grown in the state, 
the amount so paid not to exceed ;^7000 in one year, and the bounty not 
to extend beyond a term of ten years. The Forrest City Sugar Refin- 
ing Works in Portland, Me., were adapted to beet sugar making by the 
addition of machinery imported from Germany, and the Maine Beet 
Sugar Company was incorporated in 1877. In the first year, which was 
largely experimental, some 180,000 pounds of sugar and melada were 
made. About 1700 farmers became engaged in beet culture, and nearly 
1200 acres were planted. The beets yielded an average of 10 per cent, 
of sugar to the ton. The factory worked up 120 to 150 tons of beets 
daily and produced beet melada and raw sugar of good quality which 
was sold to sugar refineries. In 65 working days about 9000 tons of 
beets were worked into 900 tons of sugar and melada, which sold for 
over $100,000. There was a small profit in the business in 1879, but 
no dividends. However, the industry was quickly abandoned in Maine, 
as the supply of beets was too small. 

It is rather singular, that the aforementioned four states should 
have been chosen for the early attempts to establish the industry, as 
their climatic and soil conditions, not to speak of other reasons, offered 
no particular inducement for beet raising. Yet it is to be remembered 
that comparatively little was known at that time in regard to the re- 
quirements for successful beet culture. It was only in 1879 that Lewis 
S. Ware founded "The Sugar Beet" in Philadelphia. Too much credit 
cannot be given to Mr. Ware for his efforts to establish the industry in 
this country. Another name linked with the early efforts of establish- 
ing the industry in this country deserves to be mentioned here, namely 
that of Dr. Chas. H. Goessmann a German sugar expert, from 1871 to 
1876 a member of the faculty of the Massachusetts Agricultural College, 
Amherst, Mass., who conducted the first scientific experiments in sugar 
beet culture. In the annual report of the college, of 1872, he said 
cetera ceteribus : 

16 



"The great interest which of late has been manifested throughout the 
entire country in regard to the introduction of the beet sugar manufacture is 
a sufficient proof that its importance begins to be realized. The question 
has reached in the minds of many already a state which leaves no further 
choice for argument, than the laboratory, the field and the factory. We 
have in many respects an easier task and less discouraging prospects than 
those who began this enterprise years ago in Europe, when contemplating 
the introduction of the beet sugar manufacture. They had first to find out 
how to raise a good sugar beet and how to separate the sugar in an econom- 
ical way, while we may simply follow their teachings for the present, 
ascertain the result upon our soil, and modify our methods to suit our 
circumstances. They zt-ere not less confronted in their time by the same 
difficulties, zvhich are held up to us as great obstacles in the zcay of 
success, nam,ely: an uncertain degree of protection for a struggling home 
industry and too expensive labor by hand to compete zcith the colonial 
sugar produce of the West and East Indies. Their times were indeed 
hard and their chances frequently doubtful; yet in looking closer at their 
struggle, we cannot help noticing that the very circumstances which seemed 
at times to render success impossible, have contributed largely to a final 
good result. " 

la a footnote the author stated in support of the foregoing : 

"From 183G to 1848 about 2000 lbs. of the beet roots were required to 
produce 100 pounds of sugar (= 5 per cent. ); from 1846 to 1856 about 1500 
pounds of beet roots to produce 100 lbs. of sugar (= 6% per cent.); from 
1856 to 1868 about 1250 pounds of beej; roots for 100 lbs. of sugar 
(= 8 per cent )" 

The report goes on as follows : 

"A firm belief in the advantages offered by a rational mode of culti- 
vation and by skilled labor over mere empirical routine carried them success- 
fully to the end. How well they succeeded may be inferred from the follow- 
ing two facts: First, most of the sugar refineries which in former years were 
engaged in refining sugar from sugar cane of the Tropics, are now refining 
home-made beet sugar. Secondly, the introduction of numerous mechanical 
contrivances has reduced expensive hand-labor in the field and in the fac- 
tory to a condition which compares favorably with the relative machine and 

hand-labor employed in similar industrial operations The interests 

of the Louisiana sugar planters and the sugar beet cultivators of more 
northern sections of the country are the same as far as a proper protection 

of their industry is concerned The real success of the beet sugar 

industry in its present high stage of deTclopment, defends zcith us 
in my opinion far more on an intelligent and close attention to the 
details of its various operations in the yield and in the factory, than on 
any other requirements.^'' 

In the quotations given the italics are my own. There is hardly a 
sentence in the above cited utterances of Dr. Gokssmann, at the time 
named that is not fully applicable to-day. The whole report was a 
masterly plea for the introduction of the industry, and if his words 
had been heeded, the industry, no doubt, would have reached its 
present stage much sooner. It was possible even at that day to under- 
stand how extensive the development of the industry would be, but 
there were few who realised its possibilities,

CAUSES OF THE EARLY FAILURES OF THE INDUSTRY IN 
THE UNITED STATES. 

The principal cause or causes, for there were many to which these 
early failures above referred to were attributable, were in the first place, 
careless and haphazard methods in field and factory work. But the 
indolence, the ignorance and the inattention of the farmers, and their 
consequent inability or unwillingness to supply the then existing fac- 
tories with the necessary amount of beets of workable quality, was 
undoubtedly the main cause. 

Next to the unwillingness or inability of the farmers to furnish a 
full and regular supply of properly grown beets, careless and inexpert

factory management must be set down as a cause for the failure of all 
the early enterprises, and last but not least the lack of capital. 

Even as late as 1878 it was generally believed and publicly stated 
that the simple apparatus used in the manufacture of cider and in mak- 
ing sugar from maple sap, was sufficient for making sugar from beets. 
Bulletin No. 61 of the Maryland Agric. Experiment Station quotes 
some amusing illustrations of the popular ignorance which prevailed 
in regard to beet sugar manufacture. It quotes from a letter published 
in the Mary/and I^armer oi Decemher 1878, written by McAndrew H. 
WARD,ias follows: 

18 



"The beet juice is boiled down the same as maple sap, sorghum or 
cane juice, requiring no more labor or skill, and can be done as economically 
on the above quantity (725 bushels) as on a large amount. It needs no 
costly machinery, such as centrifugals, hydraulic presses, vacuum pans, or 

filtration through bone coal, etc The present cider mills and cheese 

factories could add to their present machinery the pans or presses, as 
required, and by co-operation on this, as in regard to other products, we 
can produce profitably all the sugar we need. 

The same writer is quoted as giving the cost of a sugar factory 
-capable of working 30 tons of beets per day as $3500 and as estimating 
that such a factory would produce in a season 480,000 pounds of sugar. 

The aforementioned Bulletin states further: '*It is evident from the 
literature of the time that the prevailing opinion in regard to the in- 
dustry was, that the beets should be sliced and dried before shipment 
to the factory. This is shown by an article in the Baltimore Sun, copied 
in the Maryland Farmer for July 1879, as follows: 

It is wonderful that the old clumsy chemistry of raw beets is not 
universally abandoned. Hereafter instead of raw beets full of bitterness 
and with only 8 per cent, of sugar, our mills will use dried beets, yielding 
50 per cent, of sugar. Instead of costing 7 cents a pound to make sugar, 
half that sum will cover the cost. Instead of our mills working at most 
three and a half months of the year, they can be kept busy for twelve 
months. Instead of being dependent upon the vicissitudes of the weather 
for every year's crop, a supply can be held in stock for two years ahead 
Baltimore may yet be destined to outrank New Orleans as a market for 
sugar. ' ' 

Before continuing the' history of the industry in the United States, 
I must briefly refer to the efforts which were made at about the same 
time in the Dominion of Canada to establish the industry there. Not- 
withstanding the fact that the Canadian Government encouraged this 
industry by a direct subsidy, the factories established in the beginning 
of the 80's at Farnham and at Berthierville in the province of Quebec, 
proved financial failures. The Berthierville plant was removed to Eddy, 
New Mexico, in 1896, and the Farnham plant in the year following to 
Rome, N. Y. The same causes which led to the failures in the United 
States, viz: lack of capital, indisposition of the farmers to raise beets, 
and mismanagement of the factories brought about the same result in 
Canada 

But to return to the history of the industry in this country: About 
the year 1879, interest in the beet sugar industry became more general 
throughout the United States. This was largely due to the persistent 
efforts in arousing interest and systematic investigations made by the 
Departement of Agriculture under the direction of Dr. WiiYjam 
McMuRTRiE, and his successor as chief of the Department of Chemistry, 
Prof. H. W. Wii.Ev. The former was the author of a most interesting 
and valuable report on beet culture which was published by the depart- 
ment in 1879. 

19 



To the persistent, untiring, one might almost say obstinate efforts 
of Dr. Wii.ey, whose name is inseparably connected with the industry 
more than to any other person living, the present promising state of the 
industry is to be attributed. Under his efficient management much was 
done, and is being done at this present time to promote the value of 
experimental station and government work in connection with beet 
culture. With a singleness of purpose and a devotion unparalleled he 
has pleaded with word and pen the cause of the industry for the last 
quarter of a century. His numerous writings and the government

reports published under his supervision, giving the results of much 
painstaking and earnest work spread the gospel of this new industry. 
Yet it was a long time before the voice of this apostle of the industry 
was heeded. 

It seems surprising that with the example set us by the older 
countries and their experience covering half a century at our command, 
the early career of the beet sugar industry in our country should have 
been marked by a succession of failures. But as we have seen, such is 
the record. However, these failures, like similar failures in most any 



new field or untried industry were elements essential to the ultimate 
success. They furnished knowledge. As the beacon of the lighthouse 
warns the navigator of the seas of dangers ahead, they disclosed to those 
who afterwards embarked in the industry the "rocks ahead" to success. 
Taking up again the historical thread we have to chronicle the 
reorganization in 1879 of the Alvarado factory, which had failed in 1876. 
Mr. E. H. Dyer, on whose property the plant was first located, bought 
the buildings and outfit and a portion of the land of the old company, 
and in 1879 organized the Standard Sugar Mfg. Co. with a capital of 
$100,000, which was afterward increased to 1^200,000 and the name of 
the company changed to the Standard Sugar Refinery. It was again 
reorganized and the name changed to the Alameda Sugar Co. , the name 
it still bears. 

PROGRESS OF THE INDUSTRY. I890-J897. 

The success of this factory, — which may justly claim the title of 
the pioneer of the industry — , in the face of a number of adverse con- 
ditions, and exposed to direct competition with the cheap product of 
plantation labor, imported free of duty from the Hawaiian Islands under 
the provision of the then existing treaty, offered a striking proof of the 
vitality of the industry. It kept alive the spark of interest, which in 
our days has kindled into a mighty flame. 

Up to 1890 practically nothing was done and the question of rais- 
ing beets and manufacturing sugar therefrom almost dropped out of 
sight completely. About this time the Oxnard Brothers, practical sugar 
men from the East, who had sold their Eastern Refinery to the Sugar 
Trust, and who had spend several months in Europe looking up the 
beet sugar industry there, came to the Pacific Coast and established 
first a factory at Chino, Cal., then one at Grand Island, Neb., and another 
one at Norfolk, Neb. Previous to the advent of the Oxnards and 
their taking a prominent part in the early struggle to establish the beet 
sugar industry on the Pacific Coast, a factory had been built at Watson- 
ville by Claus Spreckles. The movement then extended to Utah and 
New Mexico, resulting in the establishment of factories at Lehi, Utah 
and Pecos, N. M. 

The success of these seven factories demonstrated beyond the 
shadow of a doubt that beet culture and the manufacture of sugar from 
beets could be carried on successfully in the United States. 

THE INDUSTRY AWAKENING TO REAL LIFE. 

Why neither privat capital up to this time worked this great indus- 
trial domain properly, nor the government did consider it necessary 
prior to the enactment of the Dingley Law, July 1897, to protect and 
foster this industry is a question of a delicate nature, a discussion of 
which would transgress the scope and tendency of these pages. 

81 



With the year 1897 a new era was ushered in for the industry. It 
was not until then that it awoke to real life, and its vast importance was 
recognized in general business circles. In 1899 the number of factories 
had increased to 18. During the campaign of 1899 1900, thirty factories 
were in operation, and there were six added to this number for the 
past campaign 1900-1901. 

The following table gives name, location and capacity of these 
factories:

From the foregoing table it will be noticed that at the present time 
the larger number of factories, with by far the largest capacity are 
located in the Pacific Coast States, that as far as single states are con- 
cerned, the State of Michigan stands at the head of the list with nine 
factories, whose combined capacity however is only about one-half of 

22 



the rated capacity of the 8 California factories. California undoubtedly 
however may claim the honor of being the pioneer state of the industry. 
The progress of the industry in California and the practical demonstra- 
tion furnished thereby as to the value of the industry in advancing 
farming, commercial and transportation interest, in making productive 
and enhancing the value of thousands of acres of idle and non-produc- 
tive land, which had been either unprofitable or valueless, in making an 
oasis out of a desert, in working transformation scenes, which were 
nothing short of miraculous, certainly presented a strong object lesson 
to other states. But these changes were not accomplished without a 
struggle. There were strong influences to counteract and the champions 
of the industry in its early stages of development in California, met 
with many disappointments. Prof. E. W. Hilgard of the University 
of California who has done so much to advance the beet sugar industry 
in this country, in the '■'■Pacific Rural Press' of December 1897 aptly 
described the contest in California* as follows: 

"It is interesting at this time to recall these early experiences and note 
the recent repetition of similar ones, when beet sugar threatened to compete 
with the "colonial" product almost on its own ground ; for in Southern 
California at least, a patch of cana dulce formed, and to some extent still 
forms a part of the home comforts of most of the native California culti- 
vators ; and the expansion of its culture there appears to be purely a com- 
mercial question. It was here, in the fields of Los Angeles that the sugar 
beet and the sugar cane — the two competitors for the championship of the 
world in sugar production — met face to face perhaps for the first time in 
the history of the industry; one of the many examples afforded by the 
Californian climate of the bringing-together of cultures elsewhere separated 
by wide climatic and geographical intervals. But the real conflict was not 
in the cane patches and beet fields of Los Angeles. The great Hawaiian 
cane plantations were on one side; on the other the struggling beet-sugar 
factories of the central part of the state, against which were then wielded 
the same weapons that were employed at the beginning of the century in 
the same fight by the English colonial interest, and to which all but one 
— the Alvarado "Standard Sugar Refinery" — succumbed." 

Whether California will retain its rank as the largest beet sugar 
producer remains to be seen. It is unquestionable that thus far Cali- 
fornia has produced the richest sugar beets. Its soil seems particularly 
adapted for the industry and likewise the climate. There is one serious 
drawback connected with the latter, namely, the frequent droughts, 
causing sometimes total failures of the crop season after season. 
There are several of the states of the Middle West, which I think will 
forge ahead after a while and which, though they may not produce a 
beet as high in sugar content than California, but will give a sure crop 
year after year, not having to content with droughts, hot winds and 
other climatic drawbacks. 

The wonderful and rapid growth of the industry in the State of 
Michigan, to a considerable extent is due to the enactment of a bounty 

28 



bill passed in 1897, but just declared void by the Supreme Court of the 
State. There is, however, no doubt that even without the bounty law 
the State of Michigan by reason of the natural advantages, which its 
soil and climate offer, was bound to get in the front rank of the industry. 
Last year when the largest number of factories was built in the State of 
Michigan, the litigation between the factory owners and the state auditor 
had already commenced, and the verdict now given, declaring the law 
unconstitutional, was anticipated by most of those who invested in the 
industry. They knew at any rate that at best the bounty would only

AT BAY CITY. MICH. 



be given for a year or two and certainly would not have invested so 
largely, unless they had felt sure that the industry would pay without 
subsidy. 

The establishment of the industry in Michigan almost forced itself 
on the land owners as a consequence of the decline of the lumber 
industry of the state. The question had been often asked — what would 
be the fate of Northern Michigan when its fast disappearing pine timber 
was entirely gone; what would become of the busy towns and cities 
whose principal, if not sole industry was the lumber trade, and whose 



prosperity and existence was dependent upon the men employed in the 
woods and lumber mills? 

It was taken for granted that the sandy soil of Michigan would 
produce little or nothing. In the pursuit of solving the question of the 
utility of the sandy soil of Michigan and to replace a waning industry by 
a new one, the land owners had their attention directed to the culture 
and production of sugar beets. It is perhaps not saying too much that 
the introduction of the sugar beet industry in the State of Michigan was 
the only solution of the problem. I do not wish to be understood as 
denying the incentive that was given by the bounty law to the growth 
of the industry, but the conclusion seems warranted that even without 
it, it would have gained a firm footing in that state. In this connection 
a few remarks on the bounty question would seem pertinent. 

SUGAR BOUNTY SYSTEM AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE 

INDUSTRY. 

This question has been agitated more or less in most every state in 
which beets may be raised, but with the exception of Minnesota, New 
York, Pennsylvania and Washington, no other state has a bounty law 
on its statute books. So far as the foregoing four states are concerned, 
both amount of bounty and time during which it is to be paid, are 
limited. The fact that Minnesota has but one factory, New York only 
two, and Pennsylvania not even one, would seem proof in itself that our 
people fully comprehend that a bounty law is after all not such a big 
factor. And it is not also a fact that those states of the Union, pro- 
ducing the larger quantity of our sugar, are states which have no 
bounty law. 

While in general it is pretty well understood that there is no need 
of artificially fostering the industry, the agitation in favor of bounty- 
laws is still going on in many states. It is probably owing as much to 
the mistake of laying altogether too much stress on this bounty feature 
and its indiscriminate agitation, as to other mistakes that the starting 
of the industry in a number of states has been delayed. 

There can hardly be any question that the bounty principle per se 
is wrong, especially under the high protective tariff on imported sugar. 

In the European Export Bounty System, which as a notorious fact 
has become a source of trouble, both for its intended beneficiaries and 
its dispensors we can readily perceive the dangers which lurk in such a 
system. The strenous efforts made for several years now in Europe to 
abolish the system, presents conclusive proof that it has not stood the 
test. Upon the instigation of some of the governments and societies 
representing producers in the principal sugar beet raising countries of 
Europe, conference upon conference has been held, but without result. 
It has been plainly shown that most of the producers would gladly dis- 
pense with bounties, in order to escape discriminating duties, at the 

25 



same time the tremendous difficulties standing in the way of the move- 
ment for the abolition of bounties have been clearly demonstrated. 
The society of German sugar producers, representing the country pro- 
ducing the largest beet sugar crop, has repeatedly adopted resolutions, 
declaring that the abolition of bounties would be acceptable to them, 
provided all countries abolished both direct and indirect bounties. But 
so far all efforts to get the various beet sugar producing countries 
to act in concert, have utterly failed. 

Here we see then the evil consequences of this policy of artificially 
fostering an industry: The governments have assumed a sort of obliga-

tion towards their beneficiaries, who have invested large amounts of 
money in the industry on the strength of promises, which the govern- 
ments are in honor bound to redeem. They stand in the same relation 
toward their beneficiaries as one business individual to another. A 
man cannot go back on his contract without forfeiting his reputation for 
honesty and fair dealing, and so it is with governments. A wrong 
course once taken is hard to abandon or correct. This is the experi- 
ence of the European Governments relative to abolishment of sugar 
export bounties. Of course there is no intention on the part of our 

26 



Government to offer a sugar export bounty. The drawback in former 
years rebated to the sugar manufacturer was simply a refund of import 
duties on raw sugar, re-exported in the form of refined sugar. But, 
leaving aside ancient history and the part the Sugar Trust played in the 
time when the memorable changes in the sugar tariff legislation took 
place, the point I wish to make is that we can learn a profitable lesson 
from the experience of the European sugar industry with export boun- 
ties. As long as a bounty law which gives so much a pound to the 
beet grower and the sugar manufacturer is meant as an inducement to 
encourage home production and to give the industry a fair start, and, 
furthermore, as long as it is safeguarded by its provisions to attain only 
this end, the dangers which might otherwise lurk in it may be obviated. 
The permanent establishment of the industry, however, must depend 
not on national legislation nor State aid, either of which can only be 
temporary at best. Moreover, the beet sugar industry in this country 
is so firmly established that it is able to get along without the question- 
able help represented by the bounty system, and there is no need of 
artificially fostering the industry and inviting such evil results as over- 
production, unfair taxation, higher cost of the sugar to the home con- 
sumer, etc., as the bounty system has usually carried in its wake. 

It is safe to assume that sooner or later the European Governments 
will have to come to an understanding on this question. They are 
beginning to acknowledge the error of their policies of forcing the 
industry by means of bounties. The cry of the West Indian sugar 
planter, whose industry was ruthlessly destroyed by the sugar beet 
farmer of Continental Europe, is now uttered by the latter himself. This 
certainly is a strong object lesson for our people interested in the indus- 
try to take to heart. 

In concluding the historical review of the beet sugar industry in 
the United States I append a table showing the increase in production 
year by year, from 1830 to 1899;

PRESENT STATUS OF THE INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED 

STATES. 

All the signs of the time indicate that we are now on the verge of a 
much greater, more healthful and more rapid development. It is 
indeed a wonder that this industry has not attracted greater attention 
heretofore, considering the far-reaching consequences, possibilities and 
opportunities which it involves for the farmer, sugar manufacturer and 
the many trades that would directly or indirectly benefit by its growth. 
Extensive tests made for a number of years by private parties and by 
our government in various parts ot the country have demonstrated 
clearly and beyond a doubt that the sugar beet can be raised successfully 
in most all the States of the Union. This is no more an open question. 
But. furthermore, it has been demonstrated that we can and do raise 
better beets, /. e., of a higher percentage of sugar and greater purity 
than can be raised in any part of the old world. 

(In a late report by United States Consul Brittain, at Nantes, 
made to the department, the average percentage of sugar in the beet 
in various countries is given as follows: France, 11.95; Belgium, 13.75; 
Holland, 13.80; Germany, 1:J,50; Austria-Hungary, 13; Russia, 12.40; 
Sweden, 13; Denmark, 12.) 

Sugar beet culture is now making rapid strides in this country, for 
we have fully awakened to the fact that it is sure to promote our agri- 
cultural, manufacturing and entire economic interests in a degree as no 
other product will. It is of equal interest to the farmer as the manu- 
facturer and capitalist. It means employment to idle capital and 
labor. With its advent and progress we are bound to witness an 
increase in agricultural wealth beyond expectation. It will enhance the 
value of farm lands, not only by reason of its yielding larger profits than 
any other plant, but also on account of the benefit accruing to the other 
crops by superior cultivation and improved rotation. It will enable the 
farmer to diversify his crops and enable the sugar manufacturer to buy 
his raw material in the home market, instead of sending over one hun- 
dred millions of dollars for it every year to foreign countries. 

We have the soil and the climate; we have intelligent farmers and 
we have intelligent mechanics, and the one thing that has hitherto 
stood in the way of a more rapid development of the sugar beet raising 
and beet sugar manufacture was the fact that capital has not become 
sufficiently interested in it. The farmer is simply waiting for the cap- 
italist to say the word, to plant a portion of his fields in well-paying beets, 
instead of having to use them in planting low-priced wheat and corn. It 
is, for instance, a well-known fact that in what is known as the large 
corn belt of this country the farmers received for their crops 1895-96, 
during several months, only 8 to 12 cents per bushel. This low-priced 
product was exported, while the farmers might have planted a portion 
of their fields in high-priced beets for domestic consumption. Of corn 



there was harvested, taking the average of the last decade, in the prin- 
cipal corn growing states, from fifty to seventy bushels to the acre. 
The farmer received therefor, on an average of sixty bushels to the acre 
at 10 cents, say $6.00 per acre all told, and from this amount had to pay 
his expenses for plowing, seeding, cultivating and harvesting, his rent 
or interest on mortgages, taxes, living expenses, implements, etc. For 
beets the farmer receives $4.00 per ton on an average; in Nebraska $40.00 
to $50,00 per acre, and in California $60.00 to $Y0.00 in the aggregate. 
Naturally of these two amounts must be deducted the extra cost in the 
production, cultivation, harvesting and freight, which expense will 
amount to from $25.00 to $30.00, according to quantity raised and the 
distance to the sugar factory. Supposing the farmer does receive, as 
the result of failure of crops abroad, as high as 25 cents per bushel, 
even then the normal yield of the beet fields would bring them in two 
or three times as much as his corn would bring him. 

According to the latest statistical estimates the population of the 
United States represents 4 to 4^ per cent, of the entire population 
of the earth viz.: 74 of the 1Y50 millions inhabiting the globe, while we 
consume 28 per cent, of the 7^ million tons of the world's sugar pro- 
duction. (The Statistical Abstract published by the Treasury Depart- 
ment gives the population of the United States, June 1st, 1898, 74,389,- 
000.) Although the greatest sugar consuming nation in the world, 
excepting England, we are paying a tribute of over $100,000,000 annu- 
ally to foreign countries, while we could and should produce all the 
sugar we consume in our country. While four European countries, 
Germany, Austria, France and Russia, boast of over 1,400 beet sugar 
factories, up to last season we had only thirty. We produced during 
the season 1899-1900 205,000 tons. (Beets, 73,000.) Suppose now 
we produced all our own sugar, this would mean a production of 
25,000,000 tons of sugar beets, giving the farmer a return of at least 
$100,000,000, and employing 3,300,000 acres of farm land and about 
400,000 farm hands, besides an army of men employed in factories, 
machine shops, etc. And on the basis of our growing population, 
what will be the figures ten or twenty years hence? 

FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY. 

By throwing a short glance at the per capita increase in sugar con- 
sumption in this country we can easily arrive at reliable deductions. 
In 1830 the United States consumed approximately 20 pounds per 
capita; in 1840, 25 pounds; in 1850, 30 pounds; in 1880, 35 pounds; in 
1870, 40 pounds; in 1880, 45 pounds; in 189), 53 pounds, and in 1896, 
63 pounds. 

The per capita consumption in various other countries is given by 
the ^'Su^ar Trade JournaV^ as follows:

Annual increase in consumption in the United States for the last 
twenty-three years gives an average of 12 per cent, per annum, 240,000 
tons, meaning about 

70 factories of 350 tons daily capacity, or 

50 " 500 

or in other words, that for an increase in consumption alone in ten years 

700 factories of 350 tons capacity, or 

500 " 500 " 

would be required. 

Supposing for the next ten years the average increase in consump- 
tion should not exceed 150,000 tons per annum, such increase alone 
would require each year at least forty additional average sized factories 
of 350 tons capacity, representing an investment of at least $14,000,000, 
or within ten years from now at least 400 such factories, costing about 
|>140, 000,000, would be required to supply the increase in consumption 
alone. The probability, however, is all in favor of a much heavier 
increase, as, owing to the low price of sugar of late years, the consump- 
tion in certain trade fields has been vastly stimulated, while new 
consumptive channels have been opened. The increase of sugar con- 
sumption in the confectionery trade may be cited in support of my 
contention. 

30 



The value of confectionery products in this country was : 

In 1850 $ 3,000,000 

In 1860 5,000,000 

In 1870 15,000,000 

In 1880 25,000.000 

In 1890 55,000,000 

and leading manufacturers in this line estimate the value of this year's 

product at $75,000,000. 

The time was when candy was imported to a considerable amount 
into this country, but nowadays very little is brought into the United 
States, as better goods are made here and at less money than the foreign 
candy costs. 

The total output of the thirty factories which were in operation in 
the campaign of 1899-1900 amounted to 73,000 tons, or, in other 
words, about 50 per cent, of the annual increase in consumption. 




A GLIMPSE INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE DETROIT SUGAR CO.S FACTORY, 
ROCHESTER, MICH— North End. 



From the tabular statement it will be seen that England is still at the 
head as sugar consumer, consuming the largest amount of sugar per 
capita of any nation. Of course the per capita figures include sugar 
used in various manufactured articles, a portion of which is shipped for 

31 



consumption to other countries. The United States come next to 
England, with a present per capita consumption of about 65 pounds, 
but it is surely only a question of a short time when our sugar consump- 
tion will be as great and larger than England's, for the simple reason 
that our population is increasing much more rapidly than that of Eng- 
land. Thus, in five years from 1890-95 the population of England has 
increased less than one million, while our population has increased 
nearly eight millions. On the basis of the same ratio in increase the 
sugar consumption in the United States ought to reach the figure of 
5,000,000 tons before many years have passed. 

WHAT THE INDUSTRY MEANS TO OUR PEOPLE. 

It means that if we were to manufacture all the sugar consumed in 
the country our farmers would have to produce annually at least 
55,000,000 tons of sugar beets, giving them, at a low calculation $222,- 
000,000. It would employ at least 5,500,000 acres of the best farming 
land and over half-million men in the field. It would provide work for 
a vast army of skilled workingmen and ordinary laborers in the sugar 
factories, and in the machine shops, and foundries, where the machinery 
is built for the sugar houses. It would give work to the builder, stone- 
mason, bricklayer, carpenter, roofer, blacksmith and tinsmith, the bell- 
hanger and locksmith, the gasfitter, the cooper and boxmaker, the 
ropemaker, the saddler and the wheelwright. 

The transportation companies would have tens of thousands more 
carloads to haul to and from the factories, and another army of men 
would be employed in coal mines, limestone quarries, chemical and 
other factories. In fact there is hardly a branch of trade that would 
not be benefited directly or indirectly by this industry, which would 
represent, modestly estimated, an investment of about $550,000,000 in 
sugar factories alone; using at least 6,500,000 tons of coal, 4,400,000 
tons of limestone, 500,000 tons of coke, besides a vast quantity of chem- 
icals and other material. 

Is there any good reason why we should not do all this ourselves, 
instead of allowing it to be done in foreign countries, which buy com- 
paratively little from us, or which discriminate against our products? 
And can there be any question whether the sugar beet industry will 
thrive in the United States, and whether it will offer a safe and profit- 
able investment for capital? Certainly not. 

The brilliant results obtained by the beet sugar factories now in 
operation and the favorable outturn of the beet culture experiments in 
the majority of our States (and in this connection the fact is to be 
remembered that beet production increases steadily in quantity and 
quality under rational and systematic culture), makes it a safe predic- 
tion that beet culture and the beet sugar industry in the United States 
will assume enormous proportions within the next decade. I believe 



that the time is not far distant when every pound of sugar consumed in 
the United States will be grown and manufactured in our country, and, 
when instead of beipg the largest importers of sugar, we shall become 
an exporter of this paying staple. And why not? There is absolutely 
no reason why, after supplying our own people, we should not enter the 
sugar markets of the world as a competitor. 

We have accomplished such seeming impossibilities before. For 
instance, it is not so long ago that we used to import largely raw 
materials and manufactured goods in the iron and steel line. To-day 
our iron and steel products successfully compete with the products of 
the older industries of Europe in every known market of the world. 
Everything made in this line, from a two-penny nail to a complete rail- 
road engine, are shipped by us to every nook and corner of the world. 
If the assertion had been made fifteen years ago that we would furnish 
Great Britain with railroad locomotives it simply would have been ridi- 
culed, and yet this is a fact to-day. What we accontplished in this line 
we can accomplish in others, and it is my strong belief that the day is 
not so far distant when, instead of receiving sugar from foreign coun- 
tries through a few seaports, sugar will be shipped out from a large 
number of points all over the United States as one of our staple export 
articles. 

It is but natural that the importing industries and those who have 
made it a business to refine sugar from imported raw material should 
look with disfavor upon this new industry and try to arrest its progress. 
In any new process of commercial and industrial evolution, such as 
the growth and development of the beet sugar industry involves, some 
interests are bound to suffer, but the question simply is, will the 
greater mass of our people benefit by such changes? In the present 
instance this question can be answered most emphatically in the 
affirmative. 

THE ECONOMIC SIDE. 

Why 'W^e Should Raise Sugar Beets and Produce Our Own Sugar. 

First — Because if any country in the world has the predesti- 
nation to become the center of sugar production it is the United States, 
no country being more favored by its natural resources to produce 
sugar, one of the most important articles of daily consumption. 

Second — Because there is enough beet land in the United States, 
nay, even in single States to enable us to raise enough beets and to 
make sugar enough to supply our home needs and a surplus which 
could be profitably exported. 

Third — Because it will tend to renovate and make productive 
many of our farm lands that are now unprofitable and valueless, furnish- 
ing remunerative work to a large number of people, restoring hope 

33 



and bringing prosperity to many neighborhoods where despondency 
and poverty now prevail. 

i^?»rM Because with present low prices for grain, cotton and 
other agricultural products the farmer should grow such crops as give 
the best returns for the expenditure of his capital and labor. 

Fifth — Because sugar beet raising gives the farmer many times the 
profit that could be derived from any other crop, while it does not inter- 
fere with any other agricultural product, but, on the ^contrary, by 
improving the condition and capacity of the soil, produces better grain 
crops, besides permitting the growth of such profitable crops as barley 
and other high culture vegetables, which could not be raised profitably 
before. 

Sixth — Because with the introduction of sugar beet culture in our 
farming system, rotation of crops and economical and extensive culti- 
vation become possible, increasing the productivity of the land and 
likewise increasing its returns. 

Seventh — Because anything that promotes the good and welfare of 
our agriculturists is good for the nation at large. The wealth of a 
nation largely depends upon its agriculture. Wherever this is neg- 
lected decadence is sure to follow, where it is fostered, prosperity will 
increase. 

Eighth — Because beet raising and sugar making means supplying 
a large quantity of fodder and cheaper dairy and meat products. Beet 
raising and stock raising go hand in hand. The beet pulp from the 
factory feeds the stock and the manure from the stable gives back to 
field what the beet took from it. 

Ninth — Because sugar beet culture and beet sugar manufacture will 
give employment to additional labor and capital. It will require a 
great army of industrial laborers in the fields, in workshops, in mines 
and in factories, in railroad and other transportation circles, and many 
other business enterprises, besides offering an opportunity for profit- 
able investment for hundreds of millions of dollars of capital. 

Tenth — Because it would keep in the country the vast sum of 
over $100,000,000 in gold to be divided under our people, and princi- 
pally our farmers, which sum is now .sent abroad annually to pay for 
our sugar bill, and because it is against all common sense that we should 
buy that which we can profitably raise and manufacture in our own 
country. 

Eleventh— 'BecdMSQ^ as long as the words "sugar deficit" appear in 
our statistics it is obviously of the greatest importance for our country 
to increase the domestic sugar production. 

Twelfth — Because the development of this industry will cheapen 
the cost of sugar to the consumer, and because no other kind of busi- 
ness is such a wealth producer, nor put so much money in general cir- 

34 



culation. The following figures, showing the average disbursements of 

a 500-ton capacity beet sugar factory during one season, may show the 

importance of this industry. 

Amount paid to farmers for beets $225,000 

Freight paid by farmers to railroad companies 15,000 

Freight paid by factories to railroad companies 30,000 

Coal 18.000 

Limestone 8,000 

Coke and other material 87,500 

Wages 40,000 

Salaries, selling commission, etc 50,000 

The af orestated reasons, important as they are, numerically include 
only a small fraction of those that might be cited It is one of the sub- 
jects which grows in importance with closer study. When we consider 
how many industries are touched and enlivened through beet culture 
and beet sugar making, the question, should we produce all the sugar we 
consume, hardly requires further argument. 

From the foregoing also the question: 
**IS THERE MONEY IN BEET RAISING AND SUGAR MAKING?" 

-answers itself in a satisfactory manner. "Wherever our farmers have 
started to raise sugar beets for the factories the value of lands has 
trebled, quadrupled and even quintupled, which means that the price of 
lands near the now existing and operated beet sugar factories has risen 
from $50.00 to $100.00, to $200.00 and $350. 1'O per acre within two 
years after the factories were started. Apparently sterile plains have 
been turned into farms of unparalleled productivity. 

It is but a short decade ago that the traveler through certain parts 
of California, Nebraska, Michigan and other Western States where fac- 
tories are now established would pass through vast regions of land cov- 
ered by thousands of acres of giant trees, or unsightly stumps, or endless 
prairies of wild grass or sage brush, dreary wilderness, as laying in deep 
silence, only interrupted at long intervals by the ring of the woodman's 
axe. And to-day the transformation scene is almost miraculous. The 
same traveler would find well kept farms, substantial houses, the homes 
of happy and contented farmers, whose well-filled granaries and barns 
are silent witnesses of their prosperity, and all this wonderful change 
has been brought about by the sugar beet. One might have guessed 
that these lands might some day become a source of wealth, but it 
required a more than vivid imagination to see in the mind's eye the 
thousands of acres of varied crops, green fields dotted with cows, sheep 
or cattle, snug farm houses and barns and the tall chimneys of sugar 
houses, whose products run up into the millions. 

Here are a few instances: Take the country around the Chino fac- 
tory, in the Pomona Valley, California. Nine years ago it was part of a 
big ranch, nothing growing there but sage brush and wild grass. It was 
a dreary and desolate spot. Now, as far as the eye can see from the fac- 

35 



tory the land is laid out in fine looking farms, and during the beet 
season it is gleaming with thousands of beet tops. A busy town has 
grown up near the factory, and the land which nine years ago was only 
worth $15.00 per acre as grazing land, is worth now from $250.00 to 
$350.00 per acre. More wonderful still, at Watsonville, California, a tract 
of land of 12,000 acres, practically unused previous to 1891, has since 
grown beets worth one-half million dollars in one season. A town of 
some 4,000 inhabitants has grown up around the factory, and from 
$241,000 in 1890 the assessed valuation has risen to over $4,000,- 
000. The country in the middle of which now stands the Alamitos 
sugar factory was transformed inside of two years from a wilderness 
into vast beet fields. 




AMERICAN BEET SUGAR COMPANY'S FACTORY. OXNARD, GAL. 
(Front View.) 

Around Eddy, New Mexico, through the advent of a sugar factory, 
some 6,000 acres of wild cattle ranch land was changed into beet fields, 
the value of the land enhancing from $5.00 to $150.00 per acre and 
more inside of three years. This is the experience which we find 
repeated in every location where a beet sugar factory has been started. 

As far as the capitalist is concerned, he need only inquire of those 
who had the courage to start the new industry in this country as to 
what their experience has been, and he will be astonished at the tre- 
mendous success and the profits made by the pioneers of the beet sugar 
industry under less favorable conditions than existing now. 

36 



It is a matter of record that the Spreckles factory, at Watsonville, 
California, paid in four years 11*7 per cent, dividends. The outside 
stock of this factory was sold in 1897 at $800.00. This stock cost the 
original owners |>100.00, thus giving the stockholders a total return of 
$417.00 for their $100.00 investment in four years. The first dividend 
after the purchase of the stock was then 80 per cent. The Lehigh, 
Utah, factory is said to have paid for several seasons a dividend of 
371^ per cent, after putting a large percentage of its early profits into 
improvements. A short time ago it was stated in public prints that the 
earnings of the Michigan Sugar Company's factory at Bay City 
amounted in two seasons to 105 per cent, on its capital stock. The 
Ameripan Sugar Refining Company has paid on over $36,000,000 pre- 
ferred stock outstanding, 7 per cent, on over $100,000,000 common 
stock (mostly water when compared with actual cost of its refineries), 12 
per cent, yearly dividends. In many factories the stockholders were 
returned in one season about one-half of their investment, and I venture 
to say that a well managed factory will pay for itself under half-ways 
favorable circumstances in not more than three years. 

THE SUGAR TRUST— WHAT ABOUT IT? 

The Sugar trust makes its money by refining sugar imported raw 
into the United States, principally cane sugars, as will be seen from the 
following statistics showing imports into the United States of cane and 
beet sugar from 1890 to 1899.

It takes 107 pounds of raw sugar to make 100 pounds of granu- 
lated. The cost to the trust, based on 1899 average prices, calculate 
about as follows: 



107 pounds at 4.119 $4,407 

Cost of refining 35 

Freight 35 



107 pounds at 3.92 $4,194 

Cost of refining 35 

Freight 35 



$5,107 $4,894 

The trust must clear about twelve million dollars per year to pay 
interest on stock and water. Of the 2,000,000 tons of refined sugar 
which went into consumption in 1899, the trust is credited with having 
manufactured about 68 per cent., or, say, 1,360,000 tons. The trust, 
therefore, had to add about forty cents per hundred pounds to the above 
cost figures. According to Willet & Gray, the difference between raw 
and refined sugar per pound averaged 50 cents during 1899, as against 
73 cents per pound in 1898. A short time ago 96 o centrifugal raw 
sugar was selling in the open market at 4,625 cents per pound, while 
standard granulated was then quoted at 5.60 cents (less gratuity of 0.15 
cents per pound, and 1 per cent, for cash), hence if the refiner obtained 
the full net price, and the difference in his favor was 11 cents per 100 
pounds, out of which he had to defray all expenses of refining, but in 
all probability they were not receiving the full net prices, and 
the difference was most likely nearer to 50 cents or 60 cents, 
and even at this lower figure the refiners were not selling at a 
loss, according to the testimony of Mr. Havemeyer and other Sugar 
Trust magnates, as lately given before the Industrial Commission. 
According to James H. Post, of B. H. Howell, Son & Co., the cost of 
refining for 100 pounds amounts to about 35 cents, and the loss of 
weight in refining to about 28 cents, hence it would seem that a margin 
of at least 63 cents for 100 pounds between the two products would be 
necessary. A well managed average sized beet sugar factory ought to 
be able to produce standard granulated sugar at 3 cents per pound and 
less. The beet sugar manufacturer, therefore, has an advantage which 

88 



would more than outweigh the present sugar duty if it were taken off. 

Of this latter eventually, however, there is not the remotest chance. 

In this connection the following distribution figures, as given by Wil- 

lett & Gray, may be of interest.

CONCLUSION. 

Beet culture and the manufacture of'sugar from beets is one of the 
great economic questions of the day. It is of equal importance to 
the farmer, manufacturer, capitalist and statesman, and hence we find 
it agitated and discussed by our agricultural and trade journals, the 
daily press, State boards of trade, farmers' and manufacturers' associa- 
tions. Government and railroad oflicials, capitalists, economists, in fact 
every thinking man. Outside of private parties the agricultural experi- 
ment stations all over the country are experimenting on a large scale in 

39 



analyzing soils and in planting and testing sugar beets. The Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, directly and through its stations has sent out tons 
of literature concerning beet growing, distributed thousands of tons of 
seed free to farmers and is doing everything in its power to foster 
interest in the industry. 

The ultimate result certainly cannot be doubtful. The unnatural 
hesitancy of capital to work this great and promising domain — (it is 
probably the only industry at present in the United States paying in a 
bona-fide way 2^ per cent, and more net profit on capital invested) — 
seems gradually to be disappearing. Proof thereof we find in the 
rapidly increasing beet acreage, the erection of new and the enlarge- 
ment of the already existing beet sugar factories and the abundance of 
sugar projects in many of our States. 

As far as the supply of acreage is concerned the industry is firmly 
established. The farmers were slow to get started in it, but they soon 
found out that the profits from raising beets were so much greater than those 
received from growing grain or other produce. Those farmers who once got 
started and are now supplying the factories in existence, all are anxious 
to double and treble their acreage and there is a legion of farmers all 
over the United States anxious to plant beets. The main question now 
seems to be how can such a prospective crop be handled? There is but 
one answer, and that is: More factories. 

The capitalists and moneyed corporations looking for a safe and 
profitable investment for their means can certainly do no better than to 
engage in this new industry. // is the coming investment. 

The development of the industry during the past few years has 
been nothing short of phenomenal, but there is a still brighter outlook 
for it. 

Predicating the opinion upon some of the facts set forth in the pre- 
ceding pages, I feel confident that in not too far a time we shall be 
able to raise all the sugar we consume.

PART II. 



THE CULTURE OF THE SUGAR BEET. 



INTRODUCTORY. 

There is no agricultural product from which the industrious farmer 
may derive so many advantages as from the sugar beet. Sugar beet 
raising gives the farmer many times the profit that could be derived 
from any other crop, while it does not interfere with other crops, but 
on the contrary by improving the condition and capacity of the soil, 
owing to continuous and superior cultivation, produces better grain 
crops, besides permitting the growing of other high-culture plants and 
vegetables which could not be grown profitably heretofore. 

With the raising of 
larger and more valu- 
able crops naturally the 
value of the land in- 
creases. The beet, 
furthermore, produces 
fodder, and hence more 
manure. Through it the 
farmer is enabled to in- 
crease his live stock 
without hardly any in- 
crease in expense. The 
final result of all this is 
prosperity written in 
capital letters. 

Many of our States, 
as shown by exten- 
sive experiments, are 
well adapted for the 
raising of sugar beets, 
and contain in the larg-

est measure every condition necessary for the successful and fruitful 
development of the beet sugar industry, but, as has been the case in 
Europe, the successful and permanent establishment of the industry 
will depend on the interest which intelligent farmers will take in raising 
a sugar beet which will fill all the requirements of the factory. On the 

quality of the beet de- 
pends to a large extent 
the success of the fac- 
tory. A mere high per- 
centage of sugar in the 
beet, however, is not the 
sole requirement, al- 
though a most impor- 
tant one. Besides the 
largest possible amount 
of sugar, a good beet 
should contain the small- 
est percentage of foreign 
substances, whether sa- 
line, nitrogenous or in- 
different non-nitrogen- 
ous organic compounds. 
Purity in the beet is of 
as much importance as 
sugar content, for fac- 
tory experience has es- 
tablished the fact that every one per cent, of foreign admixture will 
render about 1^ percent, of sugar in the juice uncrystallizable, con- 
verting it into less valuable molasses. 

It is of the utmost importance that the farmer wishing to engage in 
beet culture should fully understand the niceties of it, and it is the pur- 
pose of these pages to aid him in the dissemination of facts which have 
been instrumental in the development of the culture in European beet 
growing countries. 

Before entering into detail on the subject of beet culture I will 
explain which constitutes a good beet for sugar making purposes. To 
do this it is necessary to first give a short history of the sugar beet. 

HISTORY OF THE SUGAR BEET. 

The beet {Beta vulgaris) is a plant of the order of the chinspodiaceae 
(goosefoot family), and was known far back in ancient history. The 
plant was found growing wild in Egypt and along the shores of the 
Mediterranean, and was cultivated long before the Christian era. 
Many varieties were known to the ancients, vastly differing in color and 
quality. In the works of Pliny, the younger, it is described as a sugary 

42

vegetable plant, and it would, therefore, appear that already at his 
time (61-113 A. D.) the beet was utilized as an article of food. How- 
ever, it seems to have been the dark red beet, which to-day is still used 

upon our tables as 
salad or pickled, 
which were preferred 
to the varieties of a 
paler color for eating 
purposes. The sup- 
position is that this 
red beet, respectively 
the sugar beet, was 
introduced into Ger- 
many, as most of the 
cultivated plants, by 
the Romans, during 
the time of their inva- 
sions into Germany. 
There are some 
forty varieties of beets 
in the United States, 
which may be divided 
into three succinct 
classes, viz.: those 
used for human food; 
second, those used 
for stock feeding, 
and third, those used 
for sugar making. 
The red and yellow- 
ish varieties grown in 
our gardens and fields 
are types of the first 
class, the many varie- 
ties of Mangelwurzel 
or stock beets illustrate the second class, while the white Kleinwanz- 
lebener, Vilmorin and the Mangold are representatives of the third class. 

VARIETIES OF SUGAR BEETS. 

The real sugar beet is white in color, a slim cone with a single tap 
root covered with fine hairlike rootlets. Originally the sugar beet was 
identical with the ordinary field or garden beet, but by careful cultiva- 
tion and selection of seed the sugar beet has been raised from its former 
condition until it now contains from 15 to 18 per cent, of sugar, and 
even higher. In the development of the sugar beet the different types 

43 




VILMORIN.

(LE PLUS RICHE.) 



have been built up in the same general way, by breeding and selection, 
as have the different breeds of cattle. The shape and size of the beet, 
its color, the color and character of the foliage, are their distinguishing 
marks. 

The varieties of beets best known in this country are the Klein- 
wanzlebener, Vilmorin and Mangold. The first two mentioned are the 
best known. The Kleinwanzlebener (Fig. 1) is probably more widely 
grown in this country than any other variety. 

It has a conical root, straight and even, quite large at the head 
and rapidly tapering, and is distinguished from the X'ilmorin by the 
brighter color and brighter colored leaves. The Vilmorin, as shown in 
Fig. 2, is of a more slender shape than the Kleinwanzlebener. It is 
claimed that it holds its sugar contents better than any other variety, 
and in those factories in which it is worked up in connection with 
other varieties it is customary to work up all other varieties first, 
reserving the Vilmorin beets for the end of the season. It is also 
claimed that the Vilmorin resists better than any other variety the 
unfavorable influences of certain characters of soil and of certain 
manures. It thrives well in black soils rich in organic matter where 
other varieties of beets become watery or saline in excess. Heavy 
quantities of nitrogenous fertilizers, which are carefully excluded from 
other varieties, can be applied with safety to the Vilmorin. Its 
average percentage of sugar is about 16 to 18 per cent., and its aver- 
age yield per acre under favorable conditions fourteen tons. The 
average yield per acre of the Kleinwanzlebener is given as fifteen tons, 
but it is generally not as rich in saccharine as the Vilmorin, running 
about 14 to 15 per cent, of sugar. 

The Vilmorin (Z^ Plus Riche), the general character of which is 
shown by Fig. 3, is superior in its yield to the Vilmorin and Kleinwanz- 
lebener, running 14 to 16 per cent, sugar in the beet and yielding from 
eighteen to twenty tons per acre. It grows entirely under the soil, is 
more slender than either the Vilmorin or Kleinwanzlebener, has a rud- 
dier skin and more compact flesh. It carries a foliage vigorous in 
growth and upright in position. 

The Mangold shown in Fig. 4 is the outcome of a careful crossing 
• of the Vilmorin with one of the former Knauer specialties and some- 
what similar in shape to the Vilmorin. Its sugar percentage ranges 
from 16 to 18 %, and the yield in tons per acre is fully up to other 
standard varieties. It has but little subsidiary root, but a strong com- 
pact form of tuber, which may be considered a special advantage from 
the sugar manufacturer's standpoint. The flat disc shaped arrangement 
of the finely curled leaves cause this variety to mature early, provided, 
of course there is propitious weather in the months of August and 
September. Besides early maturity, a high quotient of purity is claimed 

44 



for the Mangold. On account of the flat, wide spreading foliage, the 
Mangold beet seems particularly adapted to the beet growing states 
of the Union where rain is often wanting at the right time in 
summer. 

Of course, there is no variety of sugar beets, which might be said 

to be suited to all condi- 
tions of soil, climate, etc. 
In different soils and 
under different treat- 
ment given varieties 
will show different re- 
sults, nor is it safe to 
take the experience of 
one locality as applic- 
able to all and any lo- 
calities. Thus it has 
been found that the re- 
sults of certain varieties 
raised in European beet- 
growing localities, as 
compared with the re- 
sults obtained with iden- 
tically the same varieties 
and in similar soils in 
this country differed very 
largely, both as regards 
percentage of sugar and 
yield per acre. 

The only sure and 
practical way for our 
beetgrower is to ascer- 
tain by actual experi- 
ment which varieties 
are best suited for his 
lands. 




STRUCTURE OF THE BEET AND ITS CHEMICAL 
COMPOSITION. 

Internally the beet root is built up of a large number of concentric 
rings formed of a much larger number of small cells or cylinders, each 
of which is filled with a watery solution of several substances other 
than sugar. Fig. 5 shows a cross-section of a beet cut diametrically. 
The cells contain a number of crystalloid salts, such as the phosphates, 
malates, adalates of calcium and potassium, the salts of the latter 

45 



being by far the most prominent. The juice also contains a large 
number of undesirable substances (colloid bodies), such as albumin- 
ous and pectinous compounds. 
Figure 6 (reduced from Bulle- 
tin 27 of the Department of 
Agriculture) represents a cross- 
cutting made lengthwise through 
the middle of a beet, showing 
the alternate rings of compact 
portions and those more trans- 
lucent, the former containing 
rather more sugar, and the lat- 
ter more salts and albuminoids. 
A large number of nitrogenous 
bodies have been identified in 
the beet by various chemists.

Ed. Urbain, a French author- 
ity gives the distribution of ni- 
trogen in the beet from his

DISTRIBUTION OF SUGAR IN THE BEET. 

The distribution of sugar is not uniform throughout the beet, but 
varies materially in different parts of the root, as is shown in the dia- 
grams, Figs. 7, 8 and 9, after Slasskv. 

46 




Fig. 7. 



Fig. 8. 



Fig. 9. 



On basis of experiments it is safe to assert that the percentage of 
sugar present in the beet increases from the top downward. The lower 

or smaller part of the beet 
generally has a larger per- 
centage of sugar than the 
upper larger part. The 
crown or neck of the beet, 
/. e. that part of the beet 
between the base of the 
leaves and the transverse 
line showing in a vertical 
section of the beet and 
transversing it from a point 
just below the outermost 
row of leaves, not only 
contains less sugar, but is 
also of lesser purity. This 
is due to the fact, that 
such crown has been ex- 
posed to the action of the 
light and air without protection, except that furnished by the leaves. 
It will readily be understood that in beets well protected by heavy 
foliage, or grown almost entirely under ground, the difference in sugar 
percentage and purity of the crown as compared with the other part of 
the beet will be much smaller. The crown on top of the beet grown 
overground, especially when unprotected by very heavy foliage, being 
unfit for factory purposes, the beet grower will at once see the import- 
ance of aiming to prevent the overground growing of the beet as far as 
possible. 

In this connection the following quotations from authorities on beet 
culture relative to *^ Ratio of Beets to Tops'^ may be of interest. 
Lewis M. Ware states in ''The Sugar Beef : 

"As a general thing it is admitted that the weight of the leaves in a 
given crop is about equal to one-half that of the roots, and one-fourth to one- 
third for beets containing 8 to 9 percent, sugar." 

Dr. Wiley quoting from McMurtries' report, says: 

"Carenwindbr and Contamine find that there is a relation between 
the size of the leaves and the richness of the roots; that roots which bear 
leaves of broad surface, are generally more rich in sugar, than those having 
small leaves upon a contracted top and those facts are confirmed by an 
analysis of subjects taken from the same field." 

SIZE AND SHAPE OF BEETS. 

Small beets as a rule are richer in sugar than large ones. In order 
to get satisfactory returns in sugar contents, it is therefore necessary in 
raising sugar beets to keep the size down by close planting. On the 

47 



other hand it will not do to grow the beets too small, as the yield would 
be affected to too great an extent. The typical size is considered to be 
about a pound and a half to two pounds. 

Brien in the * 'Journal des Fabr. d. Sucre" says: 

"The size of the beet is the inverse ratio of its sugar and salts; the 
contents of water increases with the size and the weight of the beet." 

In very large beets, weighing more than three pounds, the sugar 
percentage and the purity will be too low to secure the best results, 
while beets of much less than one pound weight, although their sugar 
percentage and purity may be high will give too low a yield to make 
them profitable. Very small beets besides are objectionable to the 
factory inasmuch as they are apt to give extra trouble and labor. The 
aim of the beetgrower therefore should be to produce a medium sized 
beet, which will give the largest possible yield of pure crystallizable 
sugar per acre. A small beet, irregularly shaped, with so-called fingers 
and toes, or with prongs running out from the side, or with a tap root 
more or less subdivided into small roots, due to shallow culture or 
insufficient cultivation or damaging of the beet during cultivation, is 
particularly objectionable to the factory. Such beets are difficult to 
clean, they are apt to cause stoppage in the beet flues, the washers, and 
by carrying sand or small stones into the slicers, cause unnecessary 
wear of the knives. 

The following is from a report of Commercial Agent Hawes, of 
Reichenberg, Austria-Hungary: 

"The conditions required of a good sugar beet are: 

1. Regular shape (cone, pear or olive shape). Many sideroots or prongs 
are disadvantageous because they make cleaning more difificult and 
increase the waste. The leaves should be thick and should be of the 
characteristic shape and color, and those which lie flat are to be pre- 
ferred as protecting the beet against frost. 

2. Medium size, say one to two pounds. Small beets make a small crop, 
while large beets contain comparatively little sugar. The length should 
not be more than 34 centimetres (14 inches). 

3. Rich in sugar from 9 to 26 per cent. 

4. A white, compact brittle substance. Such beets are more resistant to 
destruction by storage. A small head, not protruding from the ground, 
as this head must be cut off, containing as it does very little sugar. 

5. It is very important to select the proper variety for a given district, 
because the different economical conditions of climate and soil require 
different varieties, if the largest possible crop is to be harvested. It is 
therefore quite necessary for every farmer to experiment with different 
varieties. 

Dr. Wiley in Farmers' Bulletin, No. 52, draws attention to the 
position of the beet in the soil, in the following words: 

48 




Fig. 10. 
POSITION OF BEET IN THE SOIL. 



"It is important not only that 
a sugar beet should be of the 
proper shape and size, but also 
that it should be grown in such a 
manner as to secure the protec- 
tion of the soil for all of its parts 
except the neck and foliage. The 
proper position for a beet to oc- 
cupy in the soil at the end of 
growth is shown in Figure 10. 

This position can only be se- 
cured for the beet by growing it 
in a soil sufficiently pervious to 
permit of the penetration of the 
top root to a great depth. It is 
for this reason that subsoiling in 
the preparation of a field for the 
raising of sugar beets is of such 
importance. If the beet in its 
growth should meet a practically 
impervious soil at the depth of 8 
or 10 inches, the tap root will be 
deflected from its natural course, 
lateral roots will be developed, 
the beet will become disfigured 
and disturbed in shape and the upper portion of it will be pushed out of the ground, as 
shown in Figs. 11 and 12. Experience has shown that the content of sugar in those 
portions of a beet which are pushed above the soil is very greatly diminished." 

SOIL CONDITIONS. 

The sugar beet thrives in a variety of soils, but best in rich well 
cultivated and well manured soil. Calciferous or clay sandy soils 
are equally suitable for it. A permeable subsoil is needed and 
wherever this does not exist a well arranged drainage system must be 
resorted to. 

A sandy loam has two-fold advantages for sugar beets: Firstly, it 
permits the beetroot to penetrate deep into the soil, and secondly, 
because beets grown in such soil are easily harvested without great loss 
by what is called "tare"; in other word the beet comes comparatively 
clean out of the ground, whereas beets grown in clay soil are very hard 
to get out of the ground, involving an extra expense to the farmer, by 
reason of the adherence of this soil to the beet and upon which the 
farmer pays freight. On no account should poor land be selected for 
beet culture, or land that is not well trained, for although the beet 
requires an abundance of moisture, yet it does not thrive in wet soils. 
Very light sandy soils, heavy clay soils and Alkali soils should likewise 
be avoided. Black Alkali soils are particularly objectionable. Young 
beet plants cannot survive where there is any percentage worth mention- 
ing of black Alkali or Sodic Carbonate in the soil. White Alkali if not 

49 



present in too large a percentage in the soil is not hurtful as far as the 
sugar content of the beet is concerned. It has been proven by experi- 
ments, that in a soil containing as 
much as 0. 10 % of sodic carbonate, 
beet seed will germinate freely, on 
the other hand, that it is doubtful 
whether any young plants can sur- 
vive when the stated percentage of 
0. 10% of this salt is contained in the 
soil. Sodic Sulphate does not af- 
fect germination to such a degree 
as the carbonate and the seed will 
germinate freely, even where this 
salt is equal to 0.80 % of the air- 
dried soil, but it is injurious when 
present in large quantities. Where 
both the sodic carbonate and sodic 
sulphate are present in a soil in 
equal quantities, the action of the 
carbonate or black Alkali is only 
slightly or not at all counteracted. 
Magnesic sul- 
phate retards, 
but does not 
^ prevent germi- 
nation, when 
present in quan- 
tities equal to 
one per cent, of 
the air - dried 
soil. 

Sufficient sub- 
moisture is ne- 
cessary to en- 
able the beet to 
mature. While 
in the first stages 
of development 
the plant ex- 
hausts all the 
surface water of 
the land, aided 
by the natural 
e vaporat i o n 
caused by the

sun's rays, and as the surface grows dry, the thin tap root of the plant 
works down to the subsoil where it must find sufficient moisture to fully 
mature the root. 

If the land intented for beetgrowing has never been cultivated 
before it must be thoroughly exposed to air and light, otherwise the 
crop would prove a failure. 

Prof. E. M. Skeats of the New Mex. Experiment Station in a very 
interesting report enumerates the following established facts and laws 
relating to sugar beet development: 

1. Most recent researches show that production of sugar is the effect of 
light more than heat and that it is developed best after a maximum 
development of root when root growth is at rest. 

2. Development of sugar beets takes place fastest under normal heat and 
light, when there is a maximum of soil moisture and a maximum of air 
moisture. 

3. Abnormal heat, as well as abnormal cold check development and tend 
to make the plant run into seed the first year. 

4. The beet requires for its development a certain amount of heat, which 
can be found, by adding up the mean temperature of each day, from 
the date of sowing to that of maturity. Normal heat for the beet is 
about 3000 degrees Celsius, and this is spread over about six months. 

5. For every 100 degrees of heat, the beet requires so much moisture: 

For first period of two months: 0.6 inches 
" second " " " " 0.4 " 

" third 0.4 " 

and it is very important that these proportions of moisture to heat are 
in the above order. The above gives a total for normal heat of 12^ acre- 
inches for the crop. 

6. Beet seed to sprout requires about 120° C. units of heat and soil must 
contain from 7 to 17 per cent, moisture at depth of seed. It will sprout 
at a temperature a little above freezing to 35 °C. (=94° F.) Best 
temperature is 20° C. (=70° F.) 

7. As for soil composition: 

a) Phosphoric acid is absolutely needed in sufficient quantity and more 
increases sugar. 

b) Magnesia appears next important to phosphoric acid. 

c) Lime next and great quantities, and even up to 50 per cent, are not 
hurtful. 

d) Potash is needed, but soda can replace most of the potash and it is 
said with great advantage as regards purity. 

e) Nitrogen, little is required and much is decidedly hurtful to sugar 
production. 

CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. 

As regards climate the sugar beet is not over particular. Like all 
biennial plants it can stand heat and cold; abnormal heat however as 
well as abnormal cold check its development. A summer temperature 
of not too low a degree is required. The experience of those countries, 

51 



where the beet is most successfully grown, shows that the beet thrives 
best where an average temperature of about 70° F. for the three summer 
months — June, July and August — is found. In considering the avail- 
ability of a certain location for beet raising, it is customary to draw a 
line connecting all points having this average temperature of 70 ° F. 
This line is called the isotherm of 70 ° . Lines are drawn parallel to this 
line at a distance of 100 miles either side, and the belt of land included 
between these lines is considered to be the portion of land where the beet 
is most likely to be successfully grown. This portion of land is com- 
monly called the sugar belt. 

The special report lately published by the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture gives a very exhaustive and comprehensive explanation 




Fig. 13.

under the heading of "Climatalogy," the study of which is recommended 
to the reader. This publication also gives a new map of the sugar belt 
with triple isothermal lines, from which the intelligent farmer can draw 
his own conclusions by way of comparison with local climatic and 
atmospheric conditions. Of course, it must be understood that the 
area adapted for beet culture is by no means limited to this belt. 
There are many locations outside of it which are extremely well 
suited to beet culture, while, on the other hand, some of the lands 
included in the belt would not do for beet raising at all. The map sim- 
ply is meant to indicate in a general way that area where soil and cli- 
matic conditions can be found specially adapted to the sugar beet. 

52 



Dr. Wiley, in Farmers' Bulletin No. 52, says as to the extent of the 
sugar beet belt proper in the United States. 

' 'Extending a distance of 100 miles on each side ot this isothermal 
line is a belt which, for the present, may be regarded as the theoretical 
beet sugar area of the United States. There are doubtless many localities 
lying outside of this belt, both north and south, in which the sugar beet will 
be found to thrive; but this will be due to some exceptional qualities of the 
climate or soil, and not to any favorable influence of a higher or lower tem- 
perature. A mean temperature of 70 o F. in the summer, however, must 
not be regarded as the only element of temperature which is to be taken into 
consideration. In those localities where the winters come early and are of 
unusual severity will be found greater difficulties in the production of sugar 
from the sugar beet than in those localities where the winters are light and 
mild, although the mean summer temperature of both localities may be rep- 
resented by 70 o F. As an illustration of this difficulty may be cited 
northern Nebraska and South Dakota, where the winters are of great 
severity, and Southern California, where there is scarcely any winter at all. 

" The mean summer temperature of these localities is about the same, 
but the continuation of a semi-summer temperature through the winter in 
Southern California greatly favors the growth and maturing of the beets. 
*- In Northern Nebraska and South Dakota the beets, which are to be manu- 

factured in the winter time, have to be protected by expensive silos. In 
Southern California and other places similarly situated the beets can be 
protected without any covering, or at most with only a slight covering of 
leaves or straw. The season for planting in a mild climate is also longer. 
For instance, in Southern California planting can commence as early as 
January and continue till June, thus giving a beet crop coming continuously 
into maturity from the 1st of August to the 1st of December. In other local- 
ities the planting must be accomplished in a short time, say from the 10th of 
May till the 1st of June. Before the first of these dates the ground will be 
too cold for planting and after the second the season will be so late as to 
prevent the maturity of the beets before frost. When the field is properly 
plowed and subsoiled in the late autumn the farmer will be able to take 
advantage of the first favorable opportunity in the spring to prepare the 
surface of the soil and plant the seed." 

Of the other climatic conditions which have an important bearing 
on sugar beet production, the rainfall during the crop season is of great 
importance. In order to produce a satisfactory crop, both as regards 
quantity and quality, the sugar beet requires a certain amount of moist- 
ure. There should be an annual rainfall of at least twenty-five inches, 
and thirty inches would not be an excessive amount. This rainfall should 
not be less than two inches, nor more than four inches per month. Of 
course the amount of water required to mature a crop of sugar beets 
depends largely on the nature of the soil and the cultivation which the 
crop receives. 

Where the moisture is not derived from rainfall in the usual way, or 
the soil is of that peculiar nature that it will allow subterranean moisture 
to reach the rootlets of the plant, it must be supplied by irrigation. If 
the soil is well supplied with water during the spring, thereby giving the 
crop a fair start, it will be able to mature even during a very dry season. 

53 



Just as important as rainfall is sunshine at proper seasons. A dry fall 
is the most favorable for proper ripening of the crop, and experience has 
proven that dry, sunny weather during the fall is necessary for the per- 
fection of the chemical changes wrought in the beet tissue and juice, 
whereby the sugar is produced. 

AREA TO BE ALLOTED TO BEET CULTURE 
ROTATIVE SYSTEM. 

The experience in most of the German and other European beet- 
raising districts has demonstrated the fact that the sugar ^beet may 
be grown on any one piece of ground adapted for its culture every three 
years under a rational rotative system. By a rational rotative system is 
meant an alternating change of crop, by which a certain preceding crop 
prepares the ground for a certain following crop. In other words, the 
change of crop must not be made arbitrarily, but in regular rotation, 
deep-rooted plants interchanging with short-rooted ones, cereals with 
leafed plants, and arranged in such a manner that the cereals, grasses 
and vegetables recuperate the soil and provide it with food necessary for 
the growth of the beet. In some localities of Europe beets are raised on 
the same piece of ground two or even more years in succession, but such 
culture is attended with risks and drawbacks. The farmer who wishes 
to remain on the safe side will not devote more than one-fifth to one- 
third of the acreage under cultivation to the beet, although in many beet- 
raising European countries, especially in Germany, the farmers raise 
beets on 40 to 60 per cent, of the acreage area. In soils which have 
never grown beets before, as is the case with most localities in this coun- 
try, they might be raised for several successive years without danger to 
the productiveness of the soil. Nevertheless, I would always favor a 
rational rotation. 

It stands to reason that successive raising of beets on the same piece 
of ground must produce crops gradually decreasing in quantity and 
quality, and that this will be the case the sooner and in a more marked 
manner the less fertile the ground by nature. I would always favor, and 
it will be found more advantageous to utilize the ground, after having 
grown beets on it at least one year for another crop. 

As to the crops to be grown in rotation the practical farmer is the 
best judge, and will, of course, consider local conditions, such as mar- 
ketability of the crops to be raised, etc. 

A good plan of rotation, which I understand is much practiced by 
western farmers, is to grow first corn, then some small grain, say wheat, 
oats or barley, and then sugar beets. The reason for starting the rota- 
tion with corn is that the removal of the butts, which would be necessary 
if beets were to be grown on the same piece of land the second year is 
often expensive, while at the end of the second year this would no longer 
be necessary, the butts by this time having rotted away. 

54 



In this connection a few examples of crop rotation, such as is prac- 
ticed by beet growers in Germany, may be of interest:

In the aforementioned rotations summer cereals might be displaced 
by potatoes, beans, peas or summer vegetables. 

In the beet sugar districts of France a more simple rotation is gen- 
erally practiced by the farmers, for instance :

The plan mostly adopted by the German beet growers is the so- 
called four-field plan. From this, as from any other plan, bottom lands, 
moory or clayey soils, not being adapted for beet culture, are excluded, 
and must be used for other purposes. The good land is divided into 
four sections, which are worked on a four-year turn of rotation, as follows: 

1. Winter crops, with 20 tons stable manure per acre. 

* 2. Sugar beets, without manure. 

3. Summer crops, with 12 tons stable manure per acre. 

4. Clover without manure. 

This plan of rotation is maintained once and for all. If desirable or 
convenient each section may be subdivided into two fields, so that two 
kinds of winter cereals and two kinds of leafed plants may be raised. 
The principle of the above four-field plan is to rotate cereals or shallow 
growing plants with leafed or deep growing plants, and experience has 
proven it to be a fact that by carefully observing the rotation the yield of 
the cereal crop is largely increased, owing in the first place to the more 
careful and intense cultivation of the soil, and secondly to the more ex- 
tended use of stable manure and fertilizers. 



*With stable manure. 
**With artificial fertilizer. 



55 



Beets should always follow the cereal crop, because the latter being 
harvested early, leaves the ground in readiness for early fall plowing, 
necessary to successful beet culture. 

The beet grower will do well to thoroughly study the effect of pre- 
ceding crops, for there is no question that the crop grown on a piece of 
land during the year previous to its being used for beets to a consider- 
able extent influences the quality and yield of the beet crop. The reason 
is plain enough: Different crops take from the soil such ingredients of 
fertility, and in such proportions and quantities, as they require for the 
elaboration of their plant tissues, roots, foliage, etc.; hence the soil is 
correspondingly depleted of these ingredients. Again, different crops 
vary considerably in their fertilizer requirements, as also their methods 
of growth, character of root system, etc., hence a particular crop will 
give a better yield when preceded by some crops than by others. 

FERTILIZATION. 

One of the great advantages most of our soils offer to the intending 
beet grower is their natural fertility. The German and other European 
beet growers start with a cost of from $10.00 to $15.00 per acre for fer- 
tilizers, while our farmer, if he cultivates his land properly, will not 
have to figure on such a heavy expense in this respect. The contention, 
however, frequently expressed by farmers who have never raised any 
sugar beets, and even by those who have raised beets for a season or 
more, viz. ; that just as good results can be obtained in beet raising 
without the use of manure and fertilizers, is certainly wrong and mis- 
leading. Any farmer who has studied the rudiments of the subject of 
plant feeding will readily understand that each crop that is raised upon 
a certain piece of ground removes so much of the plant food available. 
Now, if the soil was originally very rich it can stand the drain longer 
than a soil which originally contained only a small supply of plant food. 
But, in either case without fertilization the soil would become exhausted 
sooner or later. As already stated, the sugar beet requires a rich soil, 
which it leaves more or less exhausted. This soil must contain nitro- 
genic matter, potash and phosphoric acid, magnesia and lime. These 
constituents to some extent may be provided by the previous crop. 
For instance, legumes, such as clovers, beans, peas and vetches have 
the peculiarity of absorbing a vast quantity of nitrogen from the air and 
enriching the soil with this essential plant food ingredient. However, 
such part restoration of the fertility of the ground is not sufficient, and 
to insure a satisfactory return, both as regards quantity and quality, the 
soil on which the beet is grown should receive, outside of the stable 
manure, which should be applied latest in the fall previous to the plant- 
ing an addition of fertilizers containing the aforementioned properties. 
It is even preferable to give the stable manure to the crop preceding the 
beet crop. 

56 



'>< 




The above mentioned constituents are contained to a considerable 
extent in the leaves and crown of the beet, which, when left in a field, 
recuperate the soil in a measure. The percentage, however, is not suffi- 
cient to replace the amount removed by the beet. In Farmers' Bulletin 
No. 52, Dr. Wiley gives the the quantities of the aforementioned con- 
stituents in 1,000 pounds of beets and beet leaves as follows: 



CONSTITUENTS. 

Potash 

Phosphoric acid 

Magnesia 

Nitrogen 

Total ash 

These figures speak for themselves and show the wisdom of not 
removing leaves from the field unless fed to stock and returned as solid 
or liquid excrement to the soil, 
c Dr. Wiley's own comment is as follows: 

"It will be seen from the relation between the roots and leaves that 
for equal weights the amounts abstracted by the latter are considerably 
greater and deserve especial consideration in case the leaves are needed for 
cattle food. From this point of view the leaves should be left in the field. 
It is certain that otherwise complete restitution is attended with some diffi- 
culty. The form in which the above mentioned plant constituents shall be 
returned to the soil is well established for phosphoric acid and magnesia, 
and partly for nitrogen. Superphosphates, with greater or less content of 
phosphoric acid, or with addition of a nitrogenous element, and basic phos- 
phatic slags, are of universal application. As has been shown by direct 
investigations, the magnesia is nearly all returned in the press cakes from 
the factory, though a more uniform distribution than is thus secured is 
much desired, 

"The soil ingredients most essential for the successful production of 
sugar beets are nitrogen, phosphoric acid, potash, lime and magnesia. 

"Most soils contain a sufficient quantity of magnesia, and the press 
cakes from the factory, which should be returned to the soils, will supply 
any deficiency. The same is true in regard to lime, although there are some 
soils in which the supply of lime is naturally deficient. Such soils would 
be benefited by an application of land plaster, burned lime, phosphatic 
slags or ground shells. Phosphoric acid and potash are supplied in the form 
of ordinary commercial fertilizers, the phosphorus as ground bone, super- 
phosphate and basic slag, and the potash as kainite or other salt. Of the 
various potash compounds found in natural deposits all are useful. Prefer- 
ence is due only to compounds with organic substances. Consequently the 
molasses, or its residue after distillation, and the liquors of the molasses 
working processes, all rich in potash, are themselves very valuable materials 
for potash fertilization, and should be carefully preserved for such use. It 
must not be supposed, however, that the demand for potash will be satisfied 
by returning to the soil the molasses from the crop of beets in the form of 
waste products. Aside from the leaves, for which if taken from the field a 
largely increased potash return must be made, the molasses itself does not 

67 



represent the entire amount of potash taken. Factories which produce raw 
sugar sell with it also potash, and in all factories the waste waters carry 
away potash compounds sufficient to account for the difference between the 
amount of potash in the beets and in the molasses. 

' ' Phosphoric acid is best supplied in the form of ground bone, super- 
phosphate or basic slag from steel factories. 

"Nitrogen may be supplied in the form in which it exists in ground 
bone or from the refuse of the slaughter houses in the form of dried blood 
and tankage, or as cotton seed meal or oil cake, or as nitrate of soda, sul- 
phate of ammonia, etc. The simultaneous application of stall manure and 
nitrate of soda is not advisable by reason of the possible loss of nitrogen due 
to the development of denitrifying ferments. 

"As to the relation which the quantity of material returned to the soil 
should bear to the quantity abstracted by the beet, it may be said in general 
that it is desirable to return as much nitrogen, from one and a quarter to 
one and a half times as much potash, and two and a half times as much 
phosphoric acid as have been removed by the roots. Greater additions of 
potash and phosphoric acid have no disadvantageous effects upon the crop. 
Direct investigations in regard to the relations between the sugar and 
potash in consecutive crops for many years have failed to give the least 
ground for a contrary conclusion. But it must not be expected, on the 
other hand, that increasing fertilization, especially potash fertilization, will 
produce proportionately increasing crops, as has been asserted by some. 

EFFECT OF NITROGENOUS MANURES ON THE 
QUALITY OF THE BEET. 

"The opinion has generally prevailed among beet growers during late 
years that heavy nitrogenous manuring, especially with nitrate of soda, pro- 
duces no injurious effect on the quality of the beet. This opinion was based 
on the fact that in such beets the sugar per cent, was only slightly dimin- 
ished. Nevertheless, the quality of a beet may be impaired even with little 
or no diminution of the sugar content by reason of the increate of the per- 
centage of nonsugars present. 

"In this respect it has been shown that heavy manuring with nitrogen- 
ous substances greatly injures the quality of the beet for sugar making pur- 
poses. The apparent coefficient of purity of the juice is also frequently 
misleading, since no account is taken of the nature of the nonsugars present. 

"The real purity of the beet is also to be distinguished from the 
apparent purity of the juice. The real purity of the beet is obtained by 
dividing the percentage of sugar in the beet by the total solid matter in solu- 
tion therein; the apparent purity of the juice by dividing the percentage of 
. sugar therein by the apparent percentage of solids as indicated by the spe- 
cific gravity. Judicious fertilizing with nitrate of soda, however, is bene- 
ficial, and this form of nitrogenous fertilizer is in many respects the best 
known for beets. " 

It Stands to reason that a soil to which the aforementioned con- 
stituents are not fully restored will gradually lose its faculty to produce 
crops of normal quantity and quality. A good soil can only be kept up 
to the standard by restoring to it all the crop has removed, and a poor 
soil naturally requires to be supplied with those elements in which it 
is deficient. The farmer must, therefore, study this question carefully. 
It would be difficult, not to say impossible, to lay down definite rules' 

58 



The amount and nature of fertilizer to be applied must depend, of 
course, on the richness of the soil, and the experienced farmer is the 
best judge in the matter, and in most cases the question can only be 
solved satisfactorily by systematic experiments. 







Fig. U. 
GANG PLOW WITH SUBSOILING ATTACHMENT. 

Sometimes results are found lacking even under a copious use of 
fertilizers, which then is not due to inefficiency of the fertilizing mate- 
rial, but, rather, to defective quality of the soil, when an amelioration 
of natural, chemical and climatic effects is more needed than fertilizing. 
Poor soils may be brought up to the required standard of fertility by 
applying the fertilizer for several years in succession. 

Manures, as well as slow-working fertilizers, should be applied 
gradually instead of by one heavy application, which would be apt to 
produce overgrown beets of impure quality, inferior for purposes of 
sugar making. 

The manure used must in any case be well rotted^ and under no cir- 
cumstances should stable or barnyard manure be applied heavily in the 
spring, as this would have a tendency of producing beets of rank 
growth, with low sugar contents and low purity, apt to be rejected by 
the factory 

59 



Raw stable or barnyard manure is inferior to well-rotted manure. 
Sheep manure she uld never be used in the beet field, as it has posi- 
tively an injurious effect, as proven by the experience of European beet 
raisers. The application of any raw manure must be avoided in the beet 
field. As already said, if the beet field is to be manured it should be 
done in the fall, with well-rotted manure, but much the better method 
is to give the stable or barnyard manure to the preceding crop. In this 
way the organic matter, which these manures supply so abundantly, will 
have ample time to oxidize in the ground before the beet c;rop is grown. 

Of commercial fertilizers nitrate of potash, nitrate of soda, muriate 
of potash and sulphate of potash, dissolved phosphate rock and lime, 
sulphate of ammonia, dried blood and tankage are in their nature most 
suitable for beet fields. It has been found by experience that these fer- 
tilizers act much better in conjunction than when used separately. The 
following proportions, for instance, are recommended by experienced 
growers: 

Two-thirds muriate of potash and one-third sulphate of potash. 

Two-thirds muriate of potash and one-third sulphate of potash and lime. 

One-third muriate of potash and two-thirds sulphate of potash. 

One-third muriate of potash and two-thirds sulphate of potash and lime.

The subject of fertilization is one of the greatest importance to the 
farmer, and many failures in beet raising are solely due to an utter dis- 
regard of the importance of the subject on the part of farmers. The sugar 
beet makes greater demands to fertility in the soil than most any other 
crop. While cereals grown on poor soil give a small yield, the quality of 
the crop generally is not so much inferior than when the cereal is raised 
on fertile land. The sugar beet, however, under similar conditions, not 
only gives a small yield, but also the sugar content of the beet is at once 
lessened, and has been shown in instances to be less than half of what 
beets tested grown from the same seed on rich land. Farmers some- 
times raise grain on land for years without application of any kind 
of manure or fertilizer, until the land does not produce any longer a 
paying cereal crop. They then turn their attention to sugar beets, 
expecting to find this crop a means of making the land pay. A more 
fatal mistake could not be made. It cannot be stated too emphatically 
that beets of good quality and purity cannot possibly be grown on soil 
whose fertility has been almost exhausted through continuous grain 
raising, or other crops, unless some of the fertility taken away by such 
crops be returned to the soil in the form of manure or'fertilizer. Many 
of our farmers are adverse to using commercial fertilizers on account 
of the cost. But while this cost might prove too big an item in con- 

60 




nection with cereal and similar 
crops, it will always prove a 
paying investment in connec- 
tion with a sugar beet crop. 
No matter how worn out a 
soil may be, if otherwise suited 
Fig. 15. for sugar beets, by the judici^ 

HARDPAN SUBSOIL PLOW. qus application of manure and 

fertilizers it can be made to produce sugar beets fully up to or even 
exceeding the factory standard of sugar content and purity, and at the 
same time to yield a good tonnage per acre. It is solely due to a lavish 
application of commercial fertilizers, besides stable or barnyard manure, 
that the European beet raiser is enabled to produce fine crops of sugar 
beets on soils which have been under cultivation for half a century and 
longer. He would as soon think of growing sugar beets without plow- 
ing and cultivating the land as without the use of artificial fertilizers 
and manure. In concluding this chapter I have to draw attention to 
the value of the refuse lime of the sugar factories as a fertilizer. In the 
process of sugar manufacture large quantities of lime are used. It 
finally leaves the factory in a pulverized or soft state, and for most of 
our factories it is a waste, while in the European beet raising countries 
it is eagerly sought after by the beet growers as a fertilizer. Of course 
its value as such varies according to the amount of water it contains. 
Much of the lime in this waste is of about the same chemical composi- 
tion as found in water-slacked lime, while part of it is present in the 
form of carbonate of lime, and the longer the waste has been exposed 
to the air the greater the quantity of the latter. This waste contains 
also, usually, a certain percentage of nitrogen, phosphatic acid and 
potash, which add to its value as a fertilizer. 

It should never be applied in a wet state, as it would then cake, 
thereby preventing a thorough amalgamation with the soil. The best 
method is to take it to the beet fields in the fall, distributing it in small 
piles, and allow it to lie there until spring. Through the effect of the 
freezing during the winter it will reach the proper condition for spread- 
ing it and working it into the soil. Some of the beet growers in Europe 
store this material in large piles, which are worked over in intervals of 
a few weeks, which process after a couple of months gets it in a fit 
condition for use. 

CULTIVATING THE SOIL— SUBSOILING, 
PLOWING. 

Plowing of the beet field should be begun as early as possible in 
in the fall, /. e., as soon as the winter crop has been harvested, and the 
field left in furrows, so as to expose it to the action of air and light, 
which breaks the clods and produces a clear, light soil for the seed. 

61 



Only shallow plowing is required in the first instance, and for the spe- 
cial purpose to prevent weeds from going to seed. This done, where 
necessary manure should be spread, and in late fall plowing the subsoil 
be plowed to the depth of fifteen or sixteen inches, or as deep as the 
subsoil plow may go. This is of great importance, because it enables 
the beet to penetrate into the subsoil without much obstruction, thus 
preventing it from growing out of the ground and allowing it to extract 
considerable nourishment from the lower soil. However, the sixteen 
inches, or rather the difference between the unplowed soil and the cul- 
tivated soil, must on no account be turned up at once. Supposing, 
for instance, there is a difference of ten inches between the maximum 
of plowing, and, as is customary for grain, viz. : five inches, and the 
maximum of plowing required in a good worked beet field, care must 




Fig. 16. 
TWO ROW BEET HORSE HOE. 

be taken not to turn up at once these ten inches of unplowed soil, /. e., 
the ground below the bottom of the uncultivated soil. In this layer, 
never as yet having been exposed to air and light, failure of the crops 
would be inevitable, not only of beets, but also of all succeeding grain 
crops. Many farmers in this country have paid dearly for this experi- 
ence. In the first plowing not more than four to five inches of this 
uncultivated soil should be taken out, /. e., besides the four or five 
inches of cultivated soil at the very outside another four or five inches. 
It would not be advisable to increase the original four to five inches in 
fall plowing to more than eight to ten inches. The subsoil plow may, 
of course, go as deep as possible, /. ^., as deep as it can be dragged by 
the team. 



If the plowing has not been done in the fall it should be started as 
early as possible in spring, /. ^., as soon as the frost is out of the ground 
and the ground dry enough to prevent sticking. This for the following 
reasons: First, because the sooner the weeds are encouraged to grow 
the more of them can be killed before planting; secondly, because 
ground plowed while the weather is cool will retain the moisture much 
longer than it will if plowed during warm weather; and, furthermore, 
because it is much better to allow the ground to settle as much as pos- 
sible after plowing and before preparation of seed bed, so that it will 
become thoroughly packed, thereby insuring better and quicker 
germination. 

A gang plow with subsoiling attachment (such as shown in Fig. 
14) is now used where large areas are to be cultivated. If the grower 
cannot afford to buy one he may use a subsoil plow of the type shown 
in Fig. 15, to follow the furrow after the first plowing by ordinary plows. 
In case of need any ordinary plow can be used for subsoiling by taking 
off the mould-board and having the blacksmith put on a couple of 
pieces of round iron in its place that will raise the subsoil and allow it 
to drop back into the bottom of the furrow. 

After spring plowing harrow, or, better, float once immediately and 
then leave the ground as it is until the time to prepare the seed bed, 
thus allowing the weeds to sprout. If on the piece of ground intended 
for the beets corn has been grown the previous season, it is absolutely 
necessary to take the stalks and roots out of the ground in order to per- 
mit of easy and proper horse cultivation. It would not do to plow them 
under, as in cultivating later the cultivator knives would bring stalks 
and roots again to the surface, and at the same time dragging along 
with them more or less of the small beet plants. A good plan is to 
remove the mould-board from the plow, which will make it possible to 
loosen the roots without turning the cornstalks under. They can then 
be gathered up with a hay rake into piles, and after burning as much as 
possible, the remainder be hauled off. 

In following the outlined instructions the soil gets the necessary 
airing, and the snow and the frost of the winter and the sun of the 
spring will give it the required mellowness and looseness and get it in 
good condition for planting the seed the latter part of April or the 
beginning of May. 

PREPARING THE SEED BED. 

For a perfect seed bed the soil should be worked to the depth of 
four or five inches by the use of a pulverizer or cultivator, once length- 
wise and once crosswise. 

The cultivator shown in Fig. 17 is well adapted for this purpose. 
When necessary it can be followed by a harrow and roller. The work 
must be done thoroughly, so as to loosen any weeds that may already 

63 



have sprouted. Next the field is cross-harrowed, once each way, to 
level the soil perfectly and finish killing the weeds. After this, with the 
use of a heavy roller, the top soil should be smoothed and packed well 
(two to three inches). The killing of the weeds is absolutely necessary. 
If weeds are allowed to get a start the cultivation of the crop will 
involve much unnecessary and expensive hand work, besides affecting 
the result. The better the ground is packed the better the seed will 
sprout. Instead of a roller a plank float about eight to ten feet wide 
may be used. 

This preparation of the seed bed must be done when the ground is 
in good working condition and immediately before the planting, say the 
day previous if not the same day, and for the following reasons: First, 




Fig. 17. 
CULTIVATOR. 

because the seed requires considerable moisture to germinate, and allow- 
ing the seed bed to dry out might be followed by serious consequences 
to the yield; secondly, by preparing the seed bed ahead of planting the 
weeds would not get a good start. 

In dry weather it is absolutely necessary that the seed bed should 
be prepared and seeded the same day. 

To prevent blowing, which is very detrimental to the small beet 
plants, it is advisable to run a light harrow over the ground after roll- 
ing, but before seeding. This harrow must be very light, and can be 
easily constructed and without much expense by using 2x2 pine pieces 
for the beams and large nails for the teeth, only letting them project 
below the beams one and a half to two inches. This harrow must sim- 

64 



ply scratch the soil, not over one-half inch deep, thus giving a rough 
surface, which will prevent blowing, except on very dry, sandy soil, on 
which, for this reason besides others, sugar beets should never be 
planted. The soil of the seed bed thus prepared must not be loosened 
again by a deep harrowing, as this would injure the germination. 

SELECTION OF SEED. 

The field is now ready to receive the seed. The planting is usually 
done from April 15th to May 20th. But first and foremost let me say, 
the success of beet culture depends mainly on securing the right kind of seed. 
This is all important, and the farmer (or the factory which purchases 
the seed and supplies the farmer under contract) cannot be too careful 
in the selection of seed. It is very difficult to judge beet seed by its 
appearance. Sugar beet seed is of a shiny brown color and round, 
slightly flattened on one side. Each seed corn shows in some place 
a papillary growth, which contains the rootlet of the germ. This out- 
growth is more perfect in some seed varieties than in others, and 
while it is hardly visible in some seeds it is very prominent in others. 
Seed experts claim that in the best seed this outgrowth or wart is 
always strikingly visible. 

Henry W. Diederich, United States Consul at Magdeburg, in a late 
report made to the State Department, sounds a timely warning, as 
follows: 

"If I may express an opinion based on my personal observation, it is 
that some of our beet growers should insist more than they have upon get- 
ting none but the very best seed, grown from high-grade individual ' 'mother" 
beets to distribute under the beet growers. This first-class seed is sold and 
delivered by the growers on board cars in Saxony at from 8 to 10 cents per 
pound, which is a moderate price considering the fact that it takes at least 
four years to get it into the market. There is also a second-class seed 
offered for sale in this country at from 5 to 6 cents per pound. This is 
commonly called the " Nachzuchtsamen," being a seed not produced from 
mother beets, but from the first-class seed mentioned above. This inferior 
seed, however, is not used by first-class sugar men in Germany, France, 
Holland and Belgium, but most of it goes to Russia, Austria and the United 
States. 

" And this is why I deem it my duty to call attention to the importance 
of only getting the very best of seed obtainable. In my opinion those Amer- 
ican growers of sugar beets who buy cheap grades of seed make a great mis- 
take. All kinds of seed have a natural tendency to degenerate. Even the 
first-class seed mentioned above will not bring forth beets that come up to 
the standard of the original mother beet, but will show a loss of from one- 
half to 1 per cent, in sugar content. Now, the second generation of seed 
will degenerate more than as much again, and lose from 1 per cent, to 2 per 
cent. This is a small amount when considered by itself, yet it is sufficient 
not only to turn the profits of a sugar factory into a loss, but even to drive 
the concern to the wall." 

G5 



So far most of the seed used in this country comes from Europe, 
principally Germany, Austria and France, where seed growing has been 
pursued in many families for three or four generations. They devoted 
themselves entirely to the culture of beet seed and the purifying and 
amelioration of the beet race was done on scientific principles, in 
accordance with the theory of races, just like stock raising. By cross- 
ing the best varieties and repeated critical selection of mother beets a 
constant improvement was obtained, so that to-day the sugar content 
of the beet properly grown from first-class seed varies between 15 and 
25 per cent., while formerly only 6 to 8 per cent, could be obtained. 
There is no doubt that the highest point in this direction has not 
yet been reached. There is every reason to believe that a further 
improvement in the sugar beet will be obtained, until the highest stan- 
dard of quality is produced. 

In Utah some farms were started in 1895 by the Mormons for the 
exclusive production of sugar beet seed. An American sugar beet 
seed farm has also been started at Los Cruces, New Mexico, and others 
will undoubtedly follow in short order. The seeds grown on these 
farms are known under the name of "Utah Kleinwanzlebener" and 
"Eddy Kleinwanzlebener." From experiments made on a large scale 
in various States it is claimed that the Utah seed is superior in pure 
sugar per acre, /. e. , that it is superior in sugar and purity to the seed 
from which it is descended, but a little inferior in yield of tonnage. 
The seed from Eddy is said not to be far behind in results. It would, 
therefore, seem that sugar beet seed can be grown in the United States 
fully equal to the best of the imported varieties. There is no reason 
why we should not grow our own seed, and it is to be hoped that in 
course of time we will become independent of Europe in this respect. 
For some years to come, however, we will have to rely for the supply 
of most of the seed on Europe. Sugar beet seed growing is one of the 
most intricate features of the industry, and it will take years of patient 
study and practice until we shall have established a safe, reliable and 
sufficient seed production of our own. Until then we shall have to 
depend upon the old established reputable seed growers of Europe,

& Sohn, Nordhausen; O. Hoerning, Eisleben; Vilmorin-Andrieux & 
Co., Paris; F. Demesmey, Cysoing, and others. 

In selecting the seed soil conditions must, of course, be taken into 
consideration, and it is generally only by practical experiments that 
one can ascertain what variety or varieties are best suited for a certain 
soil; hence I would advise to give all the best known varieties a trial, 
and get seed of as many reliable varieties as procurable, sowing in rows, 
each, variety by itself, so that the result can be noted.

PLANTING THE SEED. 

The planting of the seed, 20 to 25 pounds per acre, according to 
soil and climatic conditions, is best done by a seed drill, hand work in 

^v planting being less reliable.

18 or 20 inches apart, or any intermediate distance, and can be regu- 
lated to a capacity of 15, 20 or 25 pounds of seed to the acre. The 
depth of planting is regulated without changing the pressure of the 
press wheels. 

It is claimed that seeds planted with machine drills sprout earlier 
and develop better than those planted by hand. Machine drills, seed- 
ing four rows at a time and dropping the seed continuously, will plant 
ten to twelve acres per day. The hardest part of beet raising is to get 
a good stand all over the field. Theoretically two to four pounds of 
beet seed would suffice to make a full stand on an acre of ground, but to 
get this stand in practise it is necessary to sow a much larger amount. 
Not less than fifteen or eighteen pounds per acre should be used. Never 
try to save a few pounds of seed, for it is much easier to thin out the 
surplus small plants with a good stand than to replant in case of a poor 
stand. It is desirable when the plants come up that they should touch 
each other. Should a crust be formed on the field after heavy rains one 
plant will help the other to break through. Furthermore, cutworms and 
other predatory insects would have to be extremely numerous in order 
to destroy enough of the crop to make it a failure. 

The seeds should be planted in rows of from fourteen to twenty 
inches apart, not deeper than necessary for a thin covering of soil, but, 
of course, in both respects the farmer must be guided by the richness of 
soil and climate. 

DIFFERENT DATES OF PLANTING. 

Tests by the Government stations and private individuals seem to 
have pretty well established the fact that late planting means generally 
a poor quality of beets, less weight in tons per acre and less sugar per 

67 



acre. In most of our localities sugar beets can be planted from early 
in April till the last of May, this being about as late as it is advisable 
to sow. Of course, a crop might be obtained from beets sown consid- 
erably later, but such late plantings are^ apt not to ripen fully, and 
naturally produce less of a crop and not near as much sugar than the 
earlier plantings. 

PLANTING ON FRESHLY PLOWED GROUND AS COM- 
PARED WITH GROUND PLOWED A FEW 
DAYS BEFORE PLANTING. 

By repeated experiments it has been demonstrated and is now gen- 
erally looked upon as an established fact that planting on freshly 
plowed ground will insure a larger and better crop. Three or four 
days between plowing and planting might mean as much as a loss of 
one-seventh and more of the weight of the crop and a corresponding 
smalleriamount in sugar value of the crop. 




Pig. 19. 

Where large areas are to be planted they should be plowed in sec- 
tions, and each section planted the day of plowing. Farmers growing 
a large acreage and not having very much help will find it advisable to 
plant in sections, say from five to seven days apart, which will give 
them more time for thinning and enable them to economize in labor. 
However, under no circumstances plant too late, for in that case, 
especially in an early, dry season, the beets will not be strong enough 
to withstand the drought. // would be much better policy to hire help 
during thinning*time than to plant too late. 

68 



DIFFERENT DEPTHS OF PLANTING. 

The depth of planting must be made dependent on the condition of 
the soil. In very damp, freshly plowed ground, especially over a wet 
subsoil, one-half inch to three-quarters inch depth is as low as would be 
advisable to sow, but in ordinary dry ground a planting at a depth of 
one inch to one and a half inches will give a better stand, yield and 
quality. Deeper planting must be avoided, especially in heavy soil, 
as otherwise the plants, if they come up at all, will be weak, and in case 
of very early planting the seed is apt to rot in the ground. 

As to soaking the seed and the use of the roller before or after the 
drilling, or both before and after, this depends on local conditions. 
Regular rules cannot be set up for it, but every practical farmer will 
decide the question for himself. In a light sandy soil it is absolutely 
necessary to use roller and float so as to compact the soil and to smooth 
and fill up all horse tracks, so that in drilling there will be no depres- 
sions for the drill to dive into. If this is not done heavy rains are apt 
to wash the sand into the depressions left by the drill, or the wind by 
blowing may fill them up, burying the seed so deep'that it would not 
come up. As a general rule I would not advise soaking of the seed, 
for if dry weather should set in immediately after planting all sprouted 
seeds would perish. 

An excess of seed will produce in a very wet spring the inconven- 
ience that some more work will be necessary in thinning out the plants. 
This extra work, however, and the small extra expense for seed will 
be amply repaid in the fall by the larger amount of beets harvested. 

IRRIGATING UP THE SEED. 

This is practised in some localities. It is done by making a small 
furrow some six inches from the seed and letting water run into this 
furrow until it soaks sideways and wets the seed. In heavy soil and 
soil which is very retentive of moisture irrigating up the seed is of no 
benefit and rather detrimental. Such soil bakes easily, and the bad 
effects of hardening would counteract the good effect of the extra 
moisture. Where the land is sandy enough so as not to bake, irrigating 
up the seed will prove beneficial. In very light soils it is almost a 
necessity, as such soils do not hold enough moisture to insure a com- 
plete germination. 

CULTIVATING THE BEET. 

The next important work of the beet farmer is hoeing and thinning 
out. Before plants are up many small weeds just germinating may be 
killed by hoeing the surface over the rows with a steel rake. The main 
thing is to kill all weeds as fast as they appear and to keep the ground 
loose. Under no circumstances must the weeds be allowed to get the 
start of the beet plants. 




Fig. 20. 
SINGLE-WHEEL HOE FOR CULTIVATING BY HAND. 



If immediately after planting the seed heavy rains should form a 

crust on the field a 
light harrow may be 
used, but only in case 
the seed has not ger- 
minated, otherwise it 
would be better to 
use a cultivator, fol- 
lowing the rows easily 
descernible from the 
marks of the press 
wheels. As soon as 
the plants break 
through the ground — 
about two weeks after 
the drilling — and the rows can be followed actual cultivation must begin. 
This work is best performed either with a one or two horse cultiva- 
tor. Figs. 20, 21 and 22 show single-row cultivators. Where four 
or more rows are to be cultivated at once the implements shown 
in Figs. 17 and 18 may be used. It is almost impossible to cul- 
tivate and hoe too much. Frequent hoeing is one of the main causes 
for satisfactory and heavy yields. In Germany they say: ^^The sugar 
is hoed into the beets.'' Three hoeings are absolutely necessary and con- 
sidered as sufficient, but I would strongly advise at least four to five 
hoeings. The additional hoeings will, of course, involve extra work 

and extra expense, but 
these will be amply repaid 
by a heavier and fuller 
yiteld of beets. Experi- 
ments in this direction have 
shown that the additional 
hoeings increased the yield 
from an acre one-half to 
three-fourths ton and more, 
and produced a better qual- 
ity of beets. The reason is 
easily explained. Fre-

weeds, loosen the soil, so 
that the air can exert its beneficial influence, and keep the moisture in 
the ground. Hoeing should be begun as early as possible, twice 
before the thinning out, which should be started as soon as the young 
plants have roots about one-eighth to one-sixth inch in diameter, or are 
about two inches in height. Great care must be taken in attending to this 
part of the work, which is the most important of all the cultivating work. 

70 




After the third hoeing the cultivator should be used every eight or ten 
days, and even oftener, if growing weeds should demand it. 

THINNING OUT. 

Early thinning out is the main requisite for successful beet raising, 
and can only be done properly by hand. When the beets have attained 
some size and show four leaves it is time to commence the thinning. 

The thinning out must be done in the most careful and prompt 
manner, as on it depends in a very large measure the yield and quality 
of the crop. Every inch of the beet field must be carefully weeded and 
nothing allowed to be seen above ground save the outward evidence of 
inward sugar developing growth. 

DIFFERENT DATES OF THINNING. 

The proper time to do the work is while the plants are very young, 
as soon as the third or fourth leaf becomes well defined and the root is 
only a mere thread. If the thinning is delayed too long the plant 
receives a setback from which it has difficulty to recover. 

The thinning out may be extended over a period of at least fourteen 
days without injury to the crop, and the different dates of thinning 
within this time would not have any perceptible effect on either the 
quantity or the quality of the crop. 

DIFFERENT DISTANCES OF THINNING. 

The thinning out must be done in such a manner as to leave the 

plants standing six to eight inches apart. In very rich soil six inches, 

and even four inches space between each beet in the row would be 

^^^^^^ » preferable. In fairly rich

and that if the stands are equal more tons per acse will be raised at less 

than eight inches apart than at over this distance. 

The rows should first be spaced or bunched, which is done with an 
ordinary four or six inch hoe, cutting a four or six inch bunch of beets 
out and leaving about a two-inch bunch, which will contain several 
plants, all of which are removed by hand pulling except the strongest 
plant. The best way to thin for a person is resting on his knees to go 

71 



over the row, selecting the best beet and holding it down firmly with 
the thumb and finger of the left hand, while a quick move of the 
right hand pulls up all extra beets and weeds remaining. The ground 
must be pressed firmly around the remaining plant If timely thinning 
out is neglected the roots become entangled, making the thinning det- 
rimental to the plant that is left. 

One person can thin an acre of beets in about four days, hence a 
given acreage can be thinned out at the rate of one person to each 
three or four acres. In small beet fields the thinning can generally be 
done by the family of the farmer, but the work must be done quickly, 
and where a large acreage has to be attended to it is advisable to hire 
help rather than delay the work until the beets attain much size. The 
pulling out of the surrounding plants leaves the remaining one in weak 
condition, which is not the case while only beginning to send its roots 
into the ground. 

After the thinning out three more hoeings, or, if possible, four, 
should be given, and the beet field needs no further care uutil the 
harvesting time, about five months after planting. 

TRANSPLANTING BEETS. 

This can only be practiced by setting the beets into running water. 
It is a method requiring so much care that it has usually not been found 
to pay. 

WIDTH OF ROWS. 

As to the distance from beet to beet, I would recommend 18x8 
inches, which would give to each beet in the aggregate 144 square inches, 
and which, as experience has shown, is the right average, guarding the 
interests of both — the farmer for many beets and the factory for good 
beets. This space of 144 square inches for every beet ought to give the 
right medium weight of 1^ to 2 pounds per beet by a normal growth of 
the field. What this medium weight means for the farmer will be seen 
by the following: 

At 18 inches between rows and 8 inches apart in the row there will be 18x8=144 
inches square per each plant. 

One square yard equals 1,296 cquare inches, or 144 : l,296=-9 beets. 

If we deduct one-third for faulty seed, dying plants and for bare spots in the field 
we will have at harvest time six beets for each square yard. 

One acre contains 4,840 square yards. 

Six beets per yard at 1 pound equals 6 pounds. 

Six beets per yard at 1^ pounds equals 9 pounds. 

Six beets per yard at 2 pounds equals 12 pounds. 

Therefore, Per acre at 6 pounds per yard we receive 14^ tons. 
Per acre at 9 pounds per yard we receive 21 % tons. 
Per acre at 12 pounds per yard we receive 29 tons. 

TONNAGE PER ACRE. 

From the foregoing it will be seen that the raising of ten to fifteen 
tons per acre should be easily accomplished with good tillage and toler- 

72 



ably favorable soil and climatic conditions. The average tonnage per 
acre varies in different localities. At the present time, according to the 
reports of the Agricultural Department, the average yield is between ten 
and fifteen tons, although in many localities farmers have raised a good 
beet -with a tonnage as high as twenty-five tons and more to the acre. 
The amount of sugar obtained from one ton of beets depends wholly 
upon the purity of the beet and its sugar content. Usually the amount 
ranges from 8 to 12 per cent., or from 160 to 240 pounds. Some crops 
in favored sections may do better, but the aforementioned percentage is 
a fair estimate of the average. 

I may here refute a prejudice often found among farmers who have 
never before raised sugar beets. They have probably heard of the so- 
called "beet weariness" of beet fields in Germany and fear the same 
condition may make itself felt in this country in time to come. There is 
absolutely nothing in this. In the first place no such conditions are 
known any more in Germany since fertilizers like guano, potassium, 
superphosphates, etc. , are used. This subject requires no considera- 
tion where only a reasonable percentage of the areable land is used for 
beet culture. 

To the contrary, the longer a field will be under rational beet culture 
the larger must be the crops, not only in beets, but also in the grain fol- 
lowing them. This has been found correct in Europe during fifty years 
of observation, and the same conditions will result in this country. 

MATURING OF THE BEET. HARVESTING. 

The harvesting of the beets before the middle of October should 
only be carried on to the extent necessary to satisfy immediate factory 
requirements. The time of our Indian summer is the main period of 
the formation of the sugar in the beet. The beet does not grow larger, 
but its weight and purity co-efficient materially increases. Climatic con- 
ditions in the various States, of course, will have to be considered, but 
// should be made a fixed rule to harvest only fully ripened beets. Cases on 
record in Europe show that factories have lost as much as $15,000 to 
j!20,000 in one campaign of 50,000 tons of beets by harvesting too early, 
/. e., at a time when but a small portion of the beets were fully matured. 

Beets taken from the same field later in the season showed a con- 
siderable increase in sugar contents and kept well in the silos, while 
those harvested before maturity very soon began to rot. The advice 
not to start harvesting before the crop is ripe can, therefore, not be 
repeated too often. Kfew warm days and cool nights may sometimes bring 
the beet to complete maturity and give it its full value. A sure sign of the 
ripeness of the beet easily discerned by the experienced eye is the change 
of the dark green color of the beet fields into a light yellowish green. 
All the large outside leaves will be found to have withered away, leaving 
only the "heart," with its yellowish green leaves to stand. Of course, 

73 



it is only by chemical analysis that the ripeness of the beet can be accu- 
rately established, and the beets should not be considered fully matured 
until the sugar content is found to increase no more. 

The sugar factory to which the farmer is under contract, or the 
Agricultural Experiment Station of the State in which the beets are 

raised will make such tests free of 
charge to the beet grower. It is 
advisable to harvest the riper stands 
in the. beet fields first, and leave the 
greener stands until later, perhaps as 
late as November. In as much as beets 
are not injured even by quite a severe 
frost, part of the crop may be left in 
the ground in an ordinary year until 
the end of November, and even into 
December. The harvesting is done 
by means of a horse puller (Fig. 23), 
which is driven so that the prongs 
come on opposite sides of the row, 
lifting the beets a short distance and 
completely loosening them, but leav- 
ing them in the ground. 

The beets are then easily lifted 
out of the ground by means of their 
leaves. This work is mostly done by 
hand, as also the topping, which is 
the next operation in order. 
I would not advise to plow out the beets with an ordinary plow, 
as by its use a considerable loss results from breaking off the lower por- 
tion of the root, and often beets are missed. 

TOPPING. 

After the beet has been loosened by the puller and partially lifted 
out of the ground the topper grasps it by the leaves and lifts it with the 
left hand from the ground, while with the right hand he removes the 
crown or top of the beet by one blow, cutting just at the base of the 
bottom leaf. 

This is done by a knife made expressly for this purpose, but a 
strong, well riveted butcher knife with a ten-inch blade will perform the 
work as well. Fig. 24 shows a properly capped beet. Fig. 25 shows 
very strikingly the loss resulting from topping an improperly raised 
beet. All that part which grew above the ground must be removed if 
the beet is intended for factory purposes, for the reason that the object- 
tionable mineral salts absorbed by the beet in its growth accumulate in 
the top, particularly in that portion grown above the surface. These 

74 




Fig. 23. 
BEET LIFTER. 




Figs. 24 and 25. 

salts exercise a very deleterious influence on the crystallization of the 
sugar, hence must not be allowed to enter the factory. 

Where beets are used for stock feeding only the top need be 
removed, and they are simply put into piles and the tops thrown over 
them as a protection from the sun or frost. 

Beets should only be pulled during the early part of the season as 
fast as the factory can use them. At the end of the season, where there 
is danger of the ground freezing, all of the crop should be harvested 
and either delivered to the factory or siloed in the field where grown. 



PITTING— SILOING. 

As beets shrink considerably if shipped in warm wea,ther, it is 
advisable for the farmer to pit them and not to ship to the factory until 
the weather gets cool. The extra work will be well paid by the gain in 
weight, besides, it will enable the farmer to harvest his crop gradually 
without employing extra labor, while otherwise when a car of beets 

76 



must be loaded in one day to prevent too great a shrinkage it requires 
extra help, and often all other farm work has to be neglected. 

The pitting must be done before the ground freezes, and all beets 
must be free from frost when pitted. 

The pits are usually arranged in a straight row about thirty feet 
apart, in which no less than two tons of topped beets are placed, mak- 
ing a slanting pile with the roots lying towards the center of the pit. 
The beets should not be covered too deeply with earth, not over six 
inches, when first pitted, for if they become too warm in the pit they 
rapidly lose in sugar content. To allow for ventilation two top open- 
ings one foot in diameter should be left in each pit. A light layer of 
loose straw (with a few inches of dirt on top of the straw to prevent it 
from blowing away) should be added before the weather gets cold, and 
in an ordinary season will offer sufficient protection, but in case of 
exceptionally cold weather it may be found necessary to cover the pits 
with long manure to prevent heavy freezing. If properly pitted beets 
will keep four to six months. If the pits are not properly protected 
and the beets kept from freezing they will rapidly spoil with changes in 
temperature. As soon as the covering of the silo freezes two inches 
shut ventilation holes with earth and keep them shut. 




Fig. 26.— BEET FORK. 



For the handling of beets a beet fork, such as shown in Fig. 26, 
with solid steel balls securely fastened^ to the tines which render it 
impossible for them to injure the roots, should be used. 

EFFECT OF FREEZING. 

Simple freezing of the beet would not cause any change in the 
sugar contents. The effect of freezing seems to be the driving of the 
sugar into the lower part of the beet, and if thawing be prevented there 
will be no loss. If beets are exposed to a heavy frost for a longer period 
that effect will be to cause considerabe damage. If the freezing has 
been light no damage would result, even if by a gradual change in the 
temperature the beets should slowly thaw up. Slightly frozen beets 
will only be unfavorably affected by a sudden change in temperature. 

76 



Thus it is explained that the upper layers of siloed beets suffer most 
by freezing and turn black as they thaw too quickly under the influ- 
ence of sunshine and warm winds, while the lower layers are not at all 
affected. 

SUGAR LOSS BY DRYING OUT. 

A question of great importance to both the beet grower and the 
factory is, what changes will occur in the beet during the weeks that 
elapse between the time the beets are taken out of the ground till they 
reach the slicer in the factory? This question is not of so great and imme- 
diate interest to the beet grower, unless the factory should refuse to 
receive and hold the beets, but require the grower to either hold them 
until the factory is ready to work them up or in some way require the 
beet grower to share the loss resulting from drying out. 

It is important for the grower to know how fast beets dry out, 
because if he sells them by the ton the drying out reduces his tonnage. 
It is, on the other hand, important for the manufacturer to know 
whether there is any loss of sugar, because, having bought the beets 
and paid for the sugar in them at the time of delivery, he wants to 
know whether the sugar will keep until he is ready for its extraction. 

Dr. Maxwell gives the loss by drying out as from 16 to 26 percent, 
for beets tied up in a sack and kept from the wind and sun for a period 
of seven days, and from 23 to 35 per cent, for beets under normal 
exposure to air and sun for the same length of time. He makes the 
average loss in the case of beets protected from the action of air and 
sun 20 per cent, in seventeen days. 

Dr. Wiley, in his report on experiments in sugar beets in 1892, 
says: "The loss of moisture during transportation or failure of the 
farmers to send in their beets as soon as harvested may tend to reduce 
the amount of water present in the beet and to raise correspondingly 
the sugar therein." In speaking of beets received from California he 
said: "The beets were long in transit and must have lost a considerable 
quantity of water. They were somewhat wilted and shriveled in appear- 
ance when received. Such beets, of course, would indicate a higher 
percentage of sugar than they would really contain in a fresh state, and 
the same remark may be applied to the beets shipped by mail any dis- 
tance, or to beets which have been exposed any considerable time to 
to the air after harvesting before the determination of sugar." 

Experiments at Fort Collins, Col., according to Bulletin No. 46, 
agreed in showing a loss of rather more than 38 per cent, in seventeen 
days, and also quite a uniformity in the rate of loss, with the greatest 
irregularities during the first days of the experiments. The maximum 
of loss for any single twenty-four hours was 5.4 per cent, of the weight 
of the beets at the beginning of the twenty-four hours. It fell trom this 
to about 2 per cent, for each twenty-four hours, where it remained. Dr. 

77 



Maxwell made the average loss equal to 20 per cent. The Fort Collins 
Experiment Station made it somewhat higher. Still there appeared a 
substantial agreement between the experiments. 

The farmer will appreciate these figures more fully, perhaps, when 
expressed in other terms. They mean this to him: If he has a crop of 
twenty tons to the acre and delays marketing it for twenty-four hours he 
has lost one ton, or one twentieth of the crop, and if he delays a week 
he will lose one-fifth ol his crop by weight. The percentage of sugar 
will be higher, but the tonnage less by the amount of evaporation. 

COST OF GROWING BEETS AND PROFIT IN 
GROWING THEM. 

It will be readily undeastood that the cost per acre of growing sugar 
beets will vary in different localities and to quite a considerable extent. 
The season, the kind of soil, the skill of the grower and the choice of 
seed are factors of prime importance. Seed suited for one locality 
would not suit for another. Then the cost will depend on the price of 
labor, rent of land, cost of fertilizer, the acreage planted and the kind 
implements used. Those who have grown beets, using only ordinary 
farm implements for seeding, cultivation and harvesting, state that the 
cost per acre is about $20.00 to $30.00. With improved machinery, 
such as a beet drill planting four rows at once, a cultivator that will 
remove the weeds and do all other work required by it on the same num- 
ber of rows for each trip across the field, and a harvester that will dig 
the beets by horsepower, the cost per acre would be, of course, materi- 
ally lessened. 

The farmer who wants to grow beets must remember that a first 
season means for him a season of education. Beet growing is some- 
thing different from other crops. It needs special tools, special care 
and special attention. Where these would be lacking results would 
naturally be lacking, too. 

The writer had frequent opportunity to notice a fixed idea with 
some farmers that sugar beet raising involved larger risks than other 
crops, or that the margin of profit was small. 

The fact is that there is no crop which on a large scale will pay as 
well. A frequent source of failure is that farmers new in the business 
will contract to furnish a larger amount of acreage than they can handle. 
I have known cases where farmers contracted to furnish three and four 
times the acreage they could possibly handle, the inevitable result being 
failure and disappointment. I most strenuously advise every farmer 
who starts into beet culture to go it slow at first. No one acting judi- 
ciously would venture into a new business in which experience and 
special knowledge must be acquired so deeply as to expose himself to 
extra risks. Frequently the agriculturist or field agent of the factory is 

78 



to be blamed. He ought to make sure that the contracting farmer is 
fully able to take care of the contracted acreage, otherwise both farmer 
and factory will be sufferers. 

There are three good, valid reasons why farmers who have started 
right in beet raising continue to raise them and are so eager in com- 
peting for factory contracts that factories are often offered twice the 
amount of beets they are able to handle. These reasons are: 

1. It is the surest crop the farmer can raise. 

2. It is a cash crop, with the price practically fixed. 

3. There is more money in it than in any other crop. 

I give a few instances of what profits were made by beet farmers 
in various States, as reported in the public press. An Omaha paper 
reported the experience of H. C. Graves & Sons as follows: 

' 'They planted over forty acres of sugar beets at Council Blu£fs, which 
were shipped by rail to the Oxnard factory at Norfolk, Neb., at a cost of 
$896.71. The total cost of this crop laid down in Norfolk was $2,196.71. 
Their gross receipts amounted to $3,524.17, leaving a net profit of $1,327.46, 
or $31.98 per acre. The loss through shrinkage while the beets were in 
transit amounted to $171.82, Had the beets been grown in Norfolk, this 
sum, as well as the $896.71 of freight would have been saved, and the net 
profit would have been $2,495.99, or at the rate of $57.73 per acre. 

In an interview in the Caro Courier John Callan gives his experi- 
ence and the results of his 1899 campaign as follows: 

"I raised five acres of sugar beets for the Caro refinery. The land 
used was a clay loam on top about ten inches deep, underlaid by red clay. 
I kept account of the cost of raising this crop and give the following items :

BEET DISEASES AND BEET PESTS. 

Funguous diseases happily have as yet not made their appearance 
in most of our beet growing sections. Beet scale has been found here 
and there, but only to a limited extent. It attacks the roots or beet 
proper, giving them a rough, "scabby" appearance. It is considered 
identical with potato scab, although the diseased patches are of larger 

70 



size. Authorities on beet diseases advise not to plant beets upon ground 
on which potatoes have recently been raised, and which might contain 
the germs of the disease. Root rot has been found where beets have 
been sown on soil heavily and freshly manured with a manure rich in 
nitrogen. 

Crown gall is another disease which has shown itself in a few local- 
ities, and makes itself known by the appearance of knotty protuberances 
on the crown of the root. 

The "leaf spot" disease, or leaf blight," is probably the most seri- 
ous of beet diseases. It impairs the crop by destruction of the foliage, 
thereby preventing the elaboration of sugar in the beet. It shows itself 
by the formation of small yellowish-white discolored spots, which soon 
cover the entire surface of the leaf, and generally attacks the older 
leaves first. By spraying with fungicides, such as "Bordeaux Mix- 
ture," the disease may be checked and the younger leaves prevented 
from taking the disease. The disease is said to be more destructive 
on land upon which beets have been raised two years or more in suc- 
cession. Dry rot has appeared in some sections, even where beets were 
planted on ground never before used for any crop liable to leave behind 
germs that would cause it; hence the contention that it is sometimes 
introduced by beet seed. Where this is the case steeping the seed in 
one-half per cent, watery solution of carbolic acid is recommended as 
the simplest, cheapest and safest method of treating the seed. If the 
disease emanates from fungi or bacteria present in the soil disinfection 
should be aided by liming and suitable treatment of the soil. The germ- 
inating power is not impaired by this remedy. 

None of the mentioned diseases have been very destructive as yet, 
and the consensus of opinion of most of our Entimologists is that they 
will not prove seriously harmful. I would advise, however, the farmer as 
soon as he discovers any disease in his beet fields, and likewise when 
they are attacked by any of the insect enemies of the beets, such as the 
"flea beetle," web worms, gophers, etc., to at once apply to the factory 
agriculturist or the Experiment Station for remedial advice.

PART IIL 



THE MANUFACTURE OF BEET SUGAR. 



GENERAL REMARKS. 

In the manufacture of sugar field work and factory work are closely 
interwoven, and yet each has its distinctive sphere. Practically the 
manufacture of sugar is accomplished by field work, while the work of 
the factory limits itself to the extraction of the sugar. In other words, 
the sugar in the beet is formed and accumulated on the field, and this 
accumulated sugar is extracted and formed into marketable shape by 
the factory. 

The manufacture of sugar, consequently, may be divided into two 
distinct departments, viz. : the production of the sugar by the field and 
its extraction and reduction to a marketable form by the factory. These 
two principal divisions, constituting the entire process of the manufac- 
ture of sugar must complement each other; in fact successful sugar manu- 
facture is inconceivable where field work and factory work do not go 
hand in hand. Furthermore, in both departments satisfactory results 
can only be achieved by employing the most up-to-date improved meth- 
ods and machinery, and, above all, competent and expert management. 

FACTORY REQUIREMENTS. 

' The sound basis for a good-paying beet sugar factory is very simple 
and stated in a few words: A sufficiently large quantity of beets of the 
highest possible quality and purity to suit the capacity of the factory, 
an abundant supply of pure water, adequate supply of fuels (coal, coke, 
etc.,) supply of limestone of suitable quality, labor at reasonable fig- 
ures, good transportation facilities, a market in winch to dispose of the 
product of the factory and its by-products, and last, but not least, 
ample capital. 

The very first and most serious consideration in starting a beet 
sugar plant must be given to the selection of a site, for, while^the condi- 

81 



tion for beet sugar raising might be entirely satisfactory in a certain 
locality, they might not be favorable for operating a factory. 

FACTORY SITE. 

The site must be selected with a view to satisfying in the greatest 
possible measure the necessary requirements for the successful opera- 
tion of a factory as stated above. There is more than one case on record 
where poor or hasty judgment in the selection of the site not only greatly 
diminished the profits of a factory, but caused its utter collapse. If 
possible the factory should be so located that it could draw its beet 
supply from within a radius of say not more than six miles, so that the 
beets could be delivered by wagon.

BAY CITY SUGAR CO.'S FACTORY, BAY CITY, MICH., 
IN COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION. 



BEET SUPPLY. 

The first* necessity of a beet sugar factory is that it should have a 
sure supply of good beets. In order to facilitate the supplying of the 
factory with such beets the plant should be located as nearly as possible 
in the center of a beet growing district. The further the factory is away 
from the beet fields the less advantageous. Not only will the profit of 
the farmer be lessenedby reason of his having to pay freight to the rail- 
road company for transporting his beets to the factory, but there is also 
the additional expense of extra handling and the loss in weight neces- 

82 



sarily resulting by shrinkage during transit. It has been variously 
estimated that the shrinkage amounts to about 20 per cent, of the orig- 
inal weight in seven days. This means that if a farmer, for instance, 
got twenty tons of beets from an acre, and it took him seven days to 
deliver to the factory, he would lose one-fifth of his crop in weight, /. e., 
he would get paid for only sixteen tons. Of course the percentage of 
sugar would be higher, but the tonnage less. It is also claimed that 
the factory cannot obtain as good results from beets grown at a distance 
as from those grown near by and delivered by wagon right after having 
been harvested. As shown already in a previous chapter, under fairly. 
favorable conditions as to soil and climate and with intelligent field 
work, fifteen and even twenty tons of beets per acre ought to be pro- 
duced, but in calculating for the beet supply it would be safer to figure 
on an average of not more than twelve tons, especially the first year, 
when probably many of the farmers are not as yet fully educated up to 
the niceties of beet culture. To supply a 350-ton plant it would require, 
therefore, say 3,600 acres to be planted in beets every year, and on the 
three year rotation plan about 10,800 acres would be necessary as beet 
area. 

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS. 

The minimum percentage of sugar required in a beet and below 
which factories, as a rule, decline to accept beets is 12 per cent., 
although they might be worked to a profit, perhaps, as low as 11 per 
cent., provided they ran over 80 per cent, in purity. The sugar content 
and purity are the factors which determine the quality of the beet. 

A high purity co-efficient will impress the practical sugar man by 
far more than high polarization, lor the purity co-efficient is the real 
deciding factor for the value of the b-et for the factory, inasmuch as low 
purity means loss of sugar in manufacture. The following taken from 
Bulletin No. 64 of the Wisconsin University Experimental Station, by 
Prof. W. A. Henry, may be of interest in this connection: 

"The problem of the relative value to the sugar manufacturer of beets 
of different purities is not easily solved, and concerning which there is a 
great diversity of opinion among expert sugar makers. The nearest 
approach to a correct expression of this relation may be found in the quan- 
tities of sugar available for sugar manufacture in the different cases. To 
illustrate : If a quantity of beets test 12 per cent, of sugar, with a purity of 
80 per cent., 100 pounds of these beets will contain 12x80 — 9.6 pounds of 
pure crystallizable sugar, which might, therefore, under ideal conditions, be 
recovered as first sugar and in low grade products. In the same manner 100 
pounds of 13 per cent, beets with a purity of 75 per cent, would furnish 
13x75 — 9.75 pounds available sugar, that is slightly more than beets of the 
former quality. According to practical factory experience 12 per cent, 
beets of 80 per cent, purity will give the same amount of sugar per ton of 
beets as 13 percent, beets of 75 per cent purity, viz.: about 160 pounds, but 
the former kind of beets are preferable, for the reason that the cost of 
extracting the sugar is increased in case of beets of a low purity.'* 

88 



PURITY CO-EFFICIENT. 

By the co-efficient of purity is meant the per cent, of solid matter in 
the juice in the form of sugar. A purity co-efficient of 85 means that 
86 per cent, of the solid matter in the juice is sugar. 

A low purity co-efficient is due to the presence of a large amount of 
solids, not sugar, in the juice. A beet testing 15 percent, sugar, with a 
purity co-efficient of 85, contains 17.05 per cent, of solid matter in the 
juice. Fifteen of the 17.66 parts, or approximately 86 per cent, is 
sugar. Prof. W. A. Henry of the Wisconsin University Station gives 
the following lucid explanation in Bulletin No. 55: 

" * * * In the pages which follow we speak of the per cent, of 
sugar in the juice and the co-efficient of purity. Let us understand the 
meaning of these terms. A hundred pounds of sugar beets contain about 
ninety-five pounds of juice. '^This juice not only contains sugar, but various 
other substances, largely mineral matter, which are a great hindrance, 
causing serious losses of sugar during the manufacture. A hundred pounds 
of average beet juice will carry about fifteen pounds of solid matter, of 
which twelve pounds may be sugar, and three pounds matter not sugar. If 
we divide the number of pounds of sugar (13) by the total pounds of solid 
matter (15) we get 80, which sum is called the co-efficient of purity; that is 
beet juice with 15 parts solids, 12 of which are sugar, is said to have co- 
efficient of purity of 80. If the sample of juice contains 16 parts solid matter, 
and 12 parts sugar, as before, then the co-efficient purity is only 75. When 
reducing the beet juice to make sugar each pound of foreign matter, not 
sugar, keeps at least one pound of sugar from crystallizing. This true, we 
see at once that the manufacturer desires beet roots not only carrying much 
sugar, but also with a high co-efficient of purity. Immature beets, those 
grown on soils rich in vegetable matter or fertilized with fresh barnyard 
manure, those grown on land recently cleared from forest or on drained 
swamp lands are all liable to carry a great deal of solid matter not sugar in 
the juice, and consequently are quite unsatisfactory to the sugar manu- 
facturer. Large beets are likewise poor in sugar. The leaf stems of the 
beet, as well as the crown of the beet itself, also carry much foreign matter." 

DIFFERENT METHODS OF OBTAINING BEET SUPPLY. 

The sugar factories now existing and under construction secure 
their necessary beet supply in different ways : 

1. By making contracts with farmers, relying altogether for the supply 
on -the farmers, the sugar company not participating in any agricultural 
work whatever by way of beet raising. 

2. By partly relying for the beet supply on the farmers and partly on 
the raising of the beets, with the assistance of hired help, on lands owned by 
the sugar company or leased from neighboring landowners. The bulk of 
the supply might be raised either by the sugar company or the farmers. 

3. Where a company or its members own a very large tract of land, 
by renting the same in sections to smaller farmers for beet raising, eventu- 
ally selling the sections to them, and thus colonizing the entire estate. 

The main argument in favor of variation No. 1 is the well-known 
principle of the division of labor, to which is added the division of risk. 

84 



The farmers on one side produce and furnish the necessary raw material 
and utilize the waste products which result in beet raising as well as in the 
factory, while the factory on the other side takes the risk of the large 
investment (sometimes millions of dollars) necessary for establishing 
and operating a factory and attends to the manufacture and sale of the 
marketable goods. Thus the farmer escapes all risk resulting in the 
manufacture by market fluctuations, etc., while the manufacturer, on 
the other hand, avoids in a large measure the chances and risks which 
attend agriculture, these latter falling to the farmers' share. 

The advantages and disadvantages of raising part or the main por- 
tion of the necessary supply on land owned or leased by the sugar com- 
pany and under the direct management of the same are plainly apparent 
after what has just been said. The manufacturing company secures for 
itself more or less independence of the farmers, but takes upon 
itself the additional risk of the larger investment of capital required to 
carry on the agricultural part of the business as well as the risks with 
which agriculture in general has to contend, such as the influence of the 
weather, securing of field labor and other emergencies. 

The variation mentioned sub. 3 has many points in its favor, 
and in a measure combines the advantages of the other variations. As 
a rule the value of the land will have increased to such an extent after 
one or two active seasons of the sugar factory that the company, if it 
feels thus disposed, can sell out its holdings to the beet farmers. Of 
course when doing so the sugar company will secure for itself a guar- 
antee for a stated supply of beets to be grown by the purchaser of its 
former lands for a certain number of years. In many cases the farmer 
will pay for the land purchase by raising an agreed upon acreage for 
the factory year after year, the value of the delivered beets being cred- 
ited to him on account of the purchase sum. In this manner both 
farmer and factory are benefited. The farmer will become owner of 
valuable and well-paying land in course of time without requiring any 
original cash investment on his part, while the owners of the land and 
of the factory erected thereon must derive big profits through the 
increase in value of rentals and selling prices of lands, aside from the 
profits resulting from the operation of the factory, /*. <r. , the sugar and 
by-products manufactured or obtained. 

In this connection a few words in regard to 

CO-OPERATIVE BEET SUGAR FACTORIES. 

Co-operative beet sugar factories flourish in many beet raising sec- 
tions of Europe, particularly in Germany. These factories are run as 
stock companies, the majority of the stockholders being farmers, every 
farmer being obliged to cultivate for each share held by him a certain 
area of land with beets, and to deliver these to the factory after they are 

85 



^ 



harvested. Settlement is made on the basis of a price fixed by the 
Board of Directors. Capitalists, who are not farmers and do not pos- 
sess any farm lands, are interested in some of these factories, but they 
are also obliged to furnish beets, and must, therefore, make contracts 
with farmers in order to supply the factory with their share of beets. 

It is claimed that these factories give better financial results than 
those run by private individuals, for the reason that: Firstly, the neces- 
sary beet supply is always assured, and, secondly, that the farmers 
interested in the factory as stockholders enjoy all the advantages result- 
ing from the large quantities of feeding and fertilizing materials obtained 
in the by-products of the factory. 

Whether co-operative farmers' sugar factories can be successfully 
established in this country is hardly to be doubted. Yet efforts made in 
various States in this direction have so far fallen short of success. Of 
course there stand many difficulties in the way of establishing such fac- 
tories here at the present time which do not exist on the other side. 
The conservatism of our farmers, the newness of the enterprise, etc., 
are, however, obstacles which in time may be overcome. Probably the 
main difficulty is that we have not as yet in the suitable locations a suffi- 
cient number of farmers who can afford to go into an enterprise of this 
kind. Some of the German co-operative companies number from 150 
to 200 farmers among their stockholders, and there are no doubt loca- 
tions in this country where a similar number of farmers would be able 
to bring up the necessary capital for establishing a factory. 

WATER SUPPLY. 

As the consumption of water in a sugar factory is enormous — (a 
350-ton plant, for instance, would require not less than 2,000,000 gallons 
per day for steam purposes, diffusion process, transporting beets from 
sheds to factory, praying the sugar and other operations) — an abundant 
supply of pure water, not alkaline, must be obtainable on or near the 
site selected. For this reason, and, furthermore, with a view to the 
cheapest and most convenient disposition of the water consumed — (per- 
fect drainage is absolutely necessary) — location on a river or running 
stream is preferable. The water course from which the factory is to 
receive its daily supply should at any rate not be more distant from the 
factory than a quarter of a mile, so that the conducting channel or con- 
duit pipes will not require too large an investment. 

Where there are no other means of supply artesian wells are 
resorted to. An analysis of the water should be made in order to deter- 
mine its purity. There may be certain salts contained which would 
affect the manufacturing process unfavorably. For instance, sulphate of 
magnesia and chloride of magnesia are molassic, or, in other words, are 
not precipitable, and consequently they will be found in molasses. One 

86 



part of salt or ashes prevents three and one-half parts of sugar from 
crystallization. It is the same with sulphate of soda. Carbonate of 
lime is practically harmless alone, but will combine with silica and form 
a hard deposit on boiler tubes and multiple effect tubes. Of the sulphate 
of lime part will combine with carbonate of lime and silica and part 
will go in molasses. 

In this connection the following extracts from "A Hand-Book for 
Chemists of Beet Sugar Houses and Seed Culture Farms," by Guilford 
L. Spencer, B. of Sc. of the United States Department of Agriculture, 
will prove interesting: 

' 'Salts in solution and their effect in water used in sugar manufacture. 
The condensation water from the multiple effects, vacuum pans, etc., form 
an abundant and very satisfactory supply of water for the boilers. 

"The water for the diffusion battery should be as pure as possible and 
should contain a minimum amount of calcium and magnesium salts and of 
the salts mentioned below as melassigenic. The calcium and magnesium 
salts, notably the bicarbonates and the sulphate of calcium foul the heating 
surface of the battery and evaporating apparatus. The bicarbonates 
decompose to some extent in the diffusers and deposit the normal carbon 
ates upon the cossettes, and probably influence the diffusion unfavorably. 
The water should not contain more than ten parts per 100,000 of calcium 
sulphate, otherwise incrustation may form at some stage of the concentra- 
tion of the liquors. 

' 'Pure water should also be used in slacking the lime, though for economy 
of sugar and in the evaporation certain wash waters containing sugar, etc., 
are used for this purpose. 

"The most important melassigenic salts are sulphates, alkaline car- 
bonates and nitrates. The chlorides are rather indifferent as regards the 
formation of molasses. " 
Under the heading "Melassigenic Salts," Mr. Spencer says: 

"The following salts are positive molasses makers, that is, salts which 
promote the formation of molasses: Carbonate acetate, butyrate and 
citrate of potassium. 

"The following have no influence on the formation of molasses and are 
classified as indifferent: Sulphate, nitrate and chloride of potassium, car- 
bonate and chloride of sodium, calcium hydrate, valerate, oxalate and suc- 
cinate of potassium and oxalate, citrate and aspartate of sodium. 

"The negative molasses makers, that is, salts which promote the crys- 
tallization of succrose, are sulphate, nitrate, acetate, butyrate, valerate and 
succinate of sodium, sulphate, chloride and bitrate of magnesium, the 
chloride and nitrate of calcium and the aspartate of potassium." 
Drainage facilities are another very important requirement. There 
are several instances on record where factory owners have been put to 
no end of trouble and considerable expense by not giving this point 
sufficient thought when selecting the site. 

FUEU COAL, COKES, ETC. 

Fuel represents another important item to be carefully considered 
in establishing and selecting the location of a beet sugar factory. For 
each ton of beets about 13 to 15 per cent, of coal and 1^ to 2 per cent. 

87 



< 



of coke is required, the latter for burning the limestone and for pro- 
ducing .corbonic acid gas — (which is obtained by combustion of coke 
and charcoal in ovens specially prepared for this purpose) — and the 
former to produce steam power. A factory working up 500 tons of beets, 
for instance, would consume about seventy-five tons of coal and seven 
and one-half to ten tons of coke every twenty-four hours. Fuel, as will 
be seen, is one of the chief factors of the cost of production. In some 
localities crude petroleum is used for fuel. It is said to be well adapted 
to the factory work, cause less dirt and require less labor to handle it, 
thus making up largely for what it lacks in cheapness. The coke should

WAVERLY, WASH. 



be seventy-two-hour coke, practically free from moisture and should 
contain about 92 per cent, of carbon and not more than three-quarters to 
1 per cent, of sulphur. 

The consumption of coal depends on the one hand upon the per- 
fect construction of the boiler plant, and on the other hand upon the 
complete utilization of the steam, as well as upon the most economical 
accumulation and utilization of all calory derived from the vapors of 
the boiling beet juices, and last, but not least, the quality of the coal 
itself. In well-equipped German and Austrian factories the consump- 
tion of coal amounts to from 7 to 12 per cent. 

88 



In reviewing this subject La Sucrerie Indigene, the leading paper of 
the industry in France, in its issue of March 16, ISOY, had the following: 

" The most significant fact is presented by the figure of steam for 100 
kilos of beets being not over 62 per cent., which means 62 steam per 100 
pounds or kilos of beets, corresponding with seventy kilos with our regular 
quality of French coal per ton of beets. The factory at Ouval, Bohemia, 
shows a figure in fuel below seventy kilos, and in locations where coal is 
cheap manufacturers do not hesitate for a moment in investing the needed 
money, sometimes in very large amounts, in improvements with regard to 
fuel percentage. What are the French manufacturers doing in regard to 
coal consumption in sugar factories? About nothing. They consume 140 
kilos per ton of beets, or double the amount used in Austrian factories." 

Here is an object lesson for our factories, who in some instances 
have used not 7 nor 14, but 23 per cent. In other words, 460 pounds, 
or 230 kilos, per ton of beets. 

Since prices of coal and cokes vary considerably in different loca- 
tions, the necessity of thoroughly looking into this question of fuel sup- 
ply will be readily understood. 

LIMESTONE. 

A ready supply of the right quality of limestone at a reasonable 
price, of which the sugar factories need large quantities, is the next 
point to be considered in studying the conditions of a locality with a 
view of erecting a factory. It is absolutely necessary that this lime- 
stone should be pure and free from any elements hurtful or hindering 
in the manufacture of sugar. 

G. L. Spencer, the before cited authority, offers the following 
"Suggestions on the Desirable and Undesirable Composition of Lime- 
stone Used in Sugar Manufacture": 

"The difiiculties usually encountered in the management of the lime kiln are as 
follows: A limestone containing too much silica will show a tendency to fuse, and if 
overheated will adhere firmly to the walls of the kiln. Stone in too small pieces, or 
stone and coke not properly distributed, or stone with an excess of coke, will sometimes 
"scaffold" or bridge. The above conditions soon prevent the downward progress of 
the stone and lime. These difficulties are obviated by the use of suitable stone, properly 
mixed with the coke and evenly distributed in the kiln, and by the withdrawal of lime 
at regular intervals. Should the charge "scafifold" in the kiln it can only be broken 
down by the withdrawal of a considerable quantity of material at the lime doors and 
energetic use of an iron bar at "the peep holes." The use of too little coke or the too 
rapid withdrawal of lime results in an undue proportion of underburned or raw lime. 
The admission of too little air to the kiln results in an imperfect combustion and an 
excess of carbonic oxide in the gas. This carbonic oxide not only is a loss of carbon, but 
if carelessly inhaled by the workmen may result in serious poisoning. The addition of 
too much air dilutes the gas. This latter may result from leakage in the pipes, careless 
charging or from driving the gas pump too fast. The following table contains valuable 
information relative to the quality of the limestone:

"Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are bad, Nos. 5, 6 and 7 are passable and Nos. 8, 9 and 10 are 
excellent. Limestone No. 3 was used in a sugar house and caused much trouble, notably 
"scaffolding," difficulty in the mechanical filtration, incrustations in the triple effect and 
on the vacuum pan coils. No. 9 was substituted for this stone and these difficulties 
disappeared. 

' ' In the examination of a limestone its physical condition as well as its chemical 
composition must be taken into account. The stone should be compact and hard, thus 
reducing the quantity of fragments and the risk of "scaffolding" in the kiln. 

" Excessive moisture, 5 per cent, or more, in the stone reduces the temperature of' 
a kiln when charging, involving an imperfect combustion and the production of carbonic 
oxide (CO); further, such stones break into small pieces under the influence of the heat. 
A small proportion of water, approximately 1 per cent., probably facilitates the decom- 
position of the stone and is advantageous. 

" Magnesium is not objectionable so far as the operation of the kiln is concerned, 
except in the presence of silicates, but it introduces difficulties in the purification of the 
juice and forms incrustations on the heating surfaces of the evaporating apparatus. It 
forms fusible silicates at high temperatures, and thus increases the tendency to "scaffold- 
ing." The objections to the sulphate of calcium are practically the same as to magnesium. 

" The objections to the presence of silicates are, as indicated above, in the forma- 
tion of fusible silicates of lime and magnesium. Part of the silica passes into the juice of 
the lime, retards the filtration with the presses and coats the cloth of mechanical filters 
to their detriment. Silica also forms part of the scale on the heating surface. Less 
harm results from this substance in hard limestones than from that in soft stones; hence 
if the stone be hard and compact a larger content of silica is admissible than in soft stone. 

" When necessarily using stone of comparatively poor quality the best obtainable 
coke should be used." 

Here, as also in buying other supplies, the maxim that the best is 
the cheapest will be found to be true. The few cents added to the cost 
will be amply repaid by the results. 



LABOR. 

The question of securing the necessary labor for field and factory 
is an important one. The field work, /. g., the cultivation of the beet 
fields, requires a large amount of hand labor, and during a few weeks 
each summer extra hands are needed for weeding, hoeing and thinning 

90 



the crop; then again extra help is needed for the harvesting of the crop 
in the fall of the year. The factory, on the other hand, requires, out- 
side of. the skilled labor, many common laborers, employed during the 
campaign; hence, if possible, the enterprise should not be started far 
from cities or towns of a floating population, where labor can be sup- 
plied at short notice and reasonable cost. 

From the following schedule an idea as to the labor required in a 
well-managed factory may be obtained:

This schedule does not include the office help, nor the labor for 
unloading beets, lime rock, coke and coal, generally done under con- 
tract. Many men employed by the factory during its manufacturing 
campaign are not needed for factory work during the beet growing sea- 
son and can be secured for field work. There has been displayed a 
tendency by the managers of some of our factories to cut down labor. 
This is trying to economize in the wrong place. The absence of a man 

91 



from his post for only a few minutes to attend to work for which 
another man should have been employed might cause a loss of many 
thousands of dollars, and I know of more than one factory where the 
campaign result suffered considerably through this mistaken policy. 

TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES. 

A very important consideration in the selection of a site for a sugar 
factory are the transportation facilities. There is considerable freight 
traffic connected with the sugar factory. Not to speak of the hundreds 
of carloads of building materials, machinery, etc., that must be brought 
to the site for the erection of the factory, there is a steady traffic in 
bringing supplies, such as beets, coal, limestone, coke, etc., sometimes 
from distant points, to the factory and in taking out the finished product 
and the by-products. Then again the transportation facilities are often 
needed to bring the workers in and around the factory to and from their 
homes. Most of the traffic is concentrated into the brief period of the 
campaign, hence ample railway or water transportation facilities are 
absolutely necessary. 

From the foregoing it follows that, other things being equal, it is 
best to locate where water (river or lake) and railroad facilities are 
available, and near some center of population, although the latter is not 
absolutely necessary. 

In this connection it may be mentioned that the sidetracks neces- 
sary for the handling of the in and outgoing freight of the factory are 
generally laid by the interested railroad companies. 

MARKET FACILITIES. 

A ready market in close proximity to the factory is perhaps not one 
of the least important conditions of success. The accessibility to trade 
centers, availability of transportation by water, as well as a larger num- 
ber of railroads, thus insuring cheap freight and greater facilities for 
marketing the product quickly, also the question as to whether these 
facilities are sufficient to permit of competition with other localities per- 
haps more favored in this regard, are points which must be given very 
serious thought before deciding on a location. 

CAPITAL NECESSARY FOR ESTABLISHING VARIOUS 
SIZED SUGAR PLANTS. 

The cost of a sugar plant and the total investment necessary to 
establish and operate such a plant depends on a number of conditions. 
It is impossible to give anything more than a rough estimate of the cost 
of building, equipping and operating a beet sugar factory applicable to 
all sections of our country. In the preceding pages I have already 
mentioned the main requisites or conditions necessary for the success 
of a factory, such as materials, labor, etc. All these conditions, which, 

92 



:^ 



of course, vary widely in different parts of the country, govern the cost 
of the plant in the first place Then it would depend to some extent on 
the character of the buildings, whether fire-proof or part fire-proof, or 
not, the capacity of the plant, kind of equipment, etc. 

Approximately the cost of a sugar house of a capacity of not less 
than 350 tons will amount to $1,000 for each ton of daily capacity, in 
other words, a factory of 350 tons capacity would cost about $350,000. 
At less than 300 tons capacity the cost would exceed the $1,000 per ton. 

The larger the size the smaller the cost of a beet sugar factory. 
The size of a projected sugar factory must be made dependent, how- 
ever, in the first place on the amount of beet acreage securable. The 
question of beet supply has already been fully discussed. 

It is not advisable to build a plant with a smaller daily capacity 
than 300 to 350 tons. If acreage and capital can be secured for a larger 
plant so much the better, for not only is the cost of construction less in 
the larger plant, but there is also a proportionate reduction in the 
operating expenses. Let the prospective investor understand thor- 
oughly that any attempt of putting up a cheap plant and making sugar 
in a small way would be bound to turn out a failure. It would be rank 
foolishness to go into the beet sugar business without ample means to 
erect a factory of proper size as well as of the most modern construc- 
tion, both as regards building and machinery. 

There is hardly a line of manufacture where the apparatus has 
undergone in the last twenty years such considerable changes as in the 
sugar manufacture. It is true that many parts of the equipment are 
still the same, but the diffusion battery, multiple effect, the pans and 
centrifugals, representing the most important parts of the machinery, 
and especially the apparatus for working up the after products, have 
undergone great changes within the time mentioned. 

BEWARE OF OLD BUILDINGS AND OLD MACHINERY. 

The opinion seems to obtain with many people that with an old 
building, a second-hand boiler and engine and worn out apparatus and 
appliances that have been used for other purposes they have a good 
nucleus for a beet sugar factory, and that with a comparatively small 
additional outlay such a plant would give satisfactory results. There is 
no more mistaken notion than this. Any attempt of this kind is simply 
that much money thrown away. No old and discarded apparatus, no 
matter how useful in former years, would serve the purpose. Not one 
of the various enterprises that were started on such a basis but proved 
a deplorable failure. 

An old building might possibly be adapted to sugar factory pur- 
poses, but the small saving in the first cost would likely soon be eaten 
up by the increased expense of operating such a plant, resulting from A'' 

93 



the necessity of adapting the arrangement of the apparatus to the 
structure. In order to build economically and insure profitable 
operation a sugar factory must be built with this special purpose 
in view. Moreover, alterations are generally dearer than the cost of 
erecting new buildings, not to speak of the advantages of new buildings 
over old ones. 

But above all, in order to make a success of a beet sugar factory it 
must be built and equipped on modern principles, fitted out with the 
best machinery that can be bought for money; in other words, the most 
perfect, labor saving and least expensive to operate, machinery that will 
extract the largest amount of sugar of the best quality at the least cost. 

HOW TO INTEREST CAPITAL. 

There are many locations in many of our States where all the neces- 
sary conditions for the successful operating of a sugar factory exist, but 
where local capital either is lacking altogether or not sufficiently strong 
to carry through a factory project. 

A community wishing to secure outside capital for the erection of 
a beet sugar factory must demonstrate by undisputable proofs that it 
can offer all the advantages required for the successful operation of a 
factory, but first and foremost, that it is able to furnish the nesessary 
beet supply. With the convincing results of the now existing factories 
before their eyes capitalists are much moreeasily interested in beet sugar 
enterprises than formerly, but they will turn down any proposition that 
does not guarantee the beet supply for the projected factory. The prime 
question, therefore, is to secure this beet supply. The best way to 
accomplish this is to get a number of prominent business men and 
farmers to form a development company. Let them subscribe a certain 
amount, say $1,000 to $2,000, to defray expenses of a canvass among 
the farmers to secure contracts, say for a year or two years, running 
from the time the factory is to be started. This acreage should be 
secured as near as possible to the point where it is intended to locate 
the factory. If a community can show that it has all the required 
advantages it will find no difficulty in securing the necessary capital. 

Very frequently in localities where favorable conditions exist local 
organizations are importuned by promoters, offering to construct a fac- 
tory on condition that a stipulated sum should be paid to them as a 
bonus, either in cash or in lands or in beets to be furnished. 

Such propositions should be peremptorily declined. In most cases 
they are schemes by that genus promoter whose sole object is to line his 
pocket with bonuses, make money out of land sales and watered stocks 
and bonds, while he cares nothing about the success of the factory. 
Enterprises based on such schemes are a menace to the industry and 
apt to turn out a failure. We have had such regretable failures, and it 

94 



(r\ 



^ 



is to be hoped that they will prove a lesson to the investor. MoreoveV, 
a beet sugar factory in any location where favorable conditions obtain 
can be financed without the dangerous and questionable stimulus 
of a bonus. 

THE FACTORY AND ITS INTERNAL ARRANGEMENT. 

The site for a factory having been selected with proper regard to 
the various conditions just discussed, the constructing engineer can 
arrange his plans in such a manner so as to attain the most satisfactory 
results in the most economical way compatible with safety. Of course 
it will be readily understood that it is altogether impossible to work all 
plans after one pattern. What might suit one locality might be utterly 
unsuitable for another, and what would be a cheap plan for one locality 
might turn out an expensive one for another. 

A modern sugar factory must be so arranged and equipped as to 
make it possible under expert and intelligent management to extract at 
the lowest cost of production all the sugar contained in the beet and to 
convert it into marketable form. This can only be done by machinery 
and apparatus of the most approved and modern type, and making use 
of every device whereby labor may be saved, the process of manufacture 
simplified and shortened and the cost of production lessened. 

A sugar factory may be said to be divided into two main depart- 
ments, viz. : the beet department and the sugar department. The for- 
mer is subdivided again in the following stations: 

1. Wash station, where the beets are cleaned. 

2. Juice station, where the raw juice is extracted from the beets and 
purified, taking in diffusion, carbonation and filtration. 

3. Evaporating station, where the juice is condensed. 

The sugar department may be divided as follows: 

1. Station where the juice is turned into white sugar. 

3. Station where the product is gotten ready for the market. 

The aforementioned stations and departments are housed in one 
main building, which has a number of annexes, such as a boiler house, 
lime kiln, oil house, cooperage, beet sheds, sugar storage house and 
office building. Sometimes one or the other of these annexes is included 
in the main building. 

The following represents a good plan of the internal arrangement 
of an up-to-date sugar plant:

In the foregoing plan installations necessary to diminish the loss 
which occurs owing to the inability to extract all crystallizable sugar 
from the residue molasses, forming from 16 to 25 per cent, of the boiled 
syrup, have not been considered. 

CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS. 

A beet sugar factory, considering the immense amount of heavy 
machinery required in its various departments, must be built solidly 
from bottom to top. Where the factory is located on or near a water 
front wood piling for foundations must ordinarily be resorted to. It is 
undoubtedly the most satisfactory and reliable method of securing in 
the ground the resistance necessary to hold up to their proper levels 
the buildings carrying such heavy weights. Concrete blocks are placed 
around the heads of the piling; they are less bulky, and, as a rule, 
cheaper, than brickwork for the same purpose. Stone masonry on a 
good bed may sometimes furnish satisfactory and cheap foundations 
for walls and piers, but cement concreting or brick will generally be 
found the cheaper method. 

While there is not so much danger to sugar factories from fire as 
is usually supposed, in the newer plants steel fire-proof construction is 
generally adopted. For the walls stone or brick is used, while the 
floors throughout are made of concrete. 

A plan now frequently adopted by builders of beet sugar plants is 
to construct the buildings large enough on the start to enable doubling 
or increasing the capacity of the plant at a given moment. This for the 
reason that the first campaign is generally one of education both for 
the farmer and the factory owner. Frequently farmers are slow the 
first season in supplying acreage, and, owing to the inexperience of 
the growers, the result of the contracted acreage does not come up to 
expectations, but after one or two seasons, when the grower has mas- 
tered the intricacies of beet culture and experienced its benefits, he will 
come readily to the front with a larger acreage. 

PROCESS OF ZWLANUFACTURING SUGAR. 

The beets, freed from tops and adhering dirt, are delivered at the 
factory in wagons or cars. They are then weighed and sampled. For 
the purpose of ascertaining the actual tare an average sample of fifty 
pounds is taken from each load. This sample is thoroughly cleansed 

96 



and examined to see if the beets are properly topped, then weighed 
again, the loss determining the tare. After the weighing and sampling 
the beets are unloaded into the storage sheds. 

Beet Storage Sheds must be arranged with separate approaches or 
roadways for cars and wagons, and should be roofed in such a manner 
that the unloading of cars and wagons may be done under cover. The 
sheds have V-shaped bottoms, at the apex of which are covered conduits 
or flumes extending the entire length of the sheds and thence to the 
wash house. The flunkies, which may be constructed either of iron or 
cement, have a movable covering. When ready to start operations, 
beginning at one end of the beet shed, part of the covering is removed 
and the beets allowed to fall into a swift current of water, which floats 
them into the factory. The flumes conveying the beets to the factory 
should be provided with a sand and stone catcher, thus arranged that 
the stone and pebbles accumulating can be taken out without stopping 
the flow of beets. -^^ 

WASHING AND SLICING THE BEETS. 

The beets on arriving at the wash house are carried by a revolving 
wheel, the so-called beet wheel, to the washer. 

Washer: This apparatus consists of a tank kept constantly full of 
fresh water, where the beets are subjected to a thorough washing by 
means of propeller arms attached to a shaft running through the center 
of the tank, which convey them from one end of the tank to the other, 
keeping them constantly agitated, in order that any adhering soil, par- 
ticles of leaves, together with any sand or pebbles, may be completely 
removed. When thoroughly cleansed the beets are ejected from the 
washer by means of an automatic device and fall into a vertical iron 
bucket elevator, which carries them to the automatic weighing machine 
and slicer on an upper floor. 

Automatic Beet Scale: The beet scale is an automatic machine which 
weighs 700 or 1,000 pounds at a time, as the case might be, and dumps 
them into the slicer, while at the same time the counter of the scale 
automatically adds up all quantities weighed and records the same. No 
mistakes are made in calculation, and it is absolutely impossible for 
any of the workingmen to tamper with the record, the counting and add- 
ing mechanism being enclosed in a locked box. 

The Slicer: The slicer cuts the beets into triangular pieces about 
one-quarter of an inch wide, one-sixteenth inch thick and of greater or 
less length. They are cut into such shape to avoid their laying too 
closely together to prevent the circulation of the diffusion liquors when 
placed in the cells of the battery. The slicer consists of a rapidly 
revolving disk about three feet in diameter, which is provided with a set 
of V-shaped knives, cutting a large number of slices off the beets at every 
revolution. 

97 



Many improvements have of late been devised with the object in 
view to obtain slices of the greatest possible regularity in size, which is 
all important for the successful working of a diffusion battery. To 
obtain this end the knives must be evenly attached in the frames. 
Among the newer inventions may be mentioned the double-knife Ber- 
green slicer, with beveled instead of flat knives to produce slices offer- 
ing the greatest facilities for osmotic action, while preventing the stick- 
ing together of the slices. 

The new Putsch blade holder is held by the part holding the blade 
protector on the plate of the slicer disk. Thus the box holding the

knives may be placed in position from the top. The elongated open- 
ings of the blade enable rapid working of the regulating screws and the 
obtaining of cossettes of desired size in short order. 

The Manguin slicer, a French invention, is novel in shape and 
working. The drum working on a horizontal shaft has eight plate 
holders, with six knives each. By an arrangement inside the drum the 
beets are carried one by one past the knives, which slice rapidly parallel 
to each other, producing slices of great regularity. It is claimed that a 
larger amount of beets can be sliced by this slicer in a given time than 
by any of the existing slicers. 

98 



DIFFUSION BATTERY. 

By means of a revolving chute the fresh beet slices (technically ' 
called cossettes) are conveyed into the large cylindrical closed tanks or 
cells of the diffusion battery on the floor below. These cells (each 
holding about two to two and a half tons) are arranged either in a circle 
or in straight rows, connected by piping and valves to facilitate filling 
with fresh sliced beets and discharging the pulp or slices exhausted of 
sugar. Each cell has adjoining it a so-called "heater" filled with brass 
tubes and so arranged that the juice may be heated by the admission of 
steam without bringing it in contact with the juice. The cells and heaters 
are so connected by piping as to allow of water and juice being admitted 
to any individual cell or being circulated through them all. It is in the 
diffusion battery that the sugar held in solution in the cells of the beets 
is extracted. 

The object of the diffusion process is to obtain sugar juice contain- 
ing as few impurities as possible. As explained in a preceding chapter 
(Structure of the Beet), the sugar is held in solution in the cells of the 
beet, but these cells also contain the impurities (salts, albuminoids, 
etc.), and whereas it is only the crystallizable bodies that have the prop- 
erty of diffusing through the cell membrane, it is desirable to have the 
cells remain intact, and the slicer is therefore arranged to cut the beets 
in such a form as to rupture as few cells as possible, at the same time 
giving as large a surface as possible for the leaching, /. ^., the action of 
the hot water resp. diluted juice in the operation in the diffusion bat- 
tery, without preventing rapid circulation of the diffusion liquors. Care 
must also be exercised to prevent bursting the cells by overheating dur- 
ing the process of diffusion. The temperature at which diffusion takes 
place is from 70 ° to 80° C, 158° to 176° Fah., according to quality 
of beet. 

By the methods formerly used the beets were ground into a fine 
pulp. Thus the cells were torn and the entire contents of the cells, 
sugar as well as salts and other impurities, carried into the juice, which 
was obtained from the pulp either by pressing by means of hydraulic 
presses, by maceration or by centrifugal force. In all these methods of 
extracting the juice a great deal of foreign matter was obtained outside 
of sugar, which made the purification of the juices very difficult and 
hindered the manufacture. At present, however, what is known as the 
diffusion process is universally used. It differs from the old one in that 
the juice is no more separated in a mechanical, but in a purely physical 
way. The hot water acting upon the cell membranes of the sliced beets 
allows the sugar in the cell to diffuse with the water on the outside until 
it contains the same percentage of sugar as that on the inside. This 
water being drawn off and replaced by fresh water, the same process 
takes place, and could be continued until all the sugar had been 

90 



extracted. The juice so obtained would, of course, be very weak in the 
diffusion battery, therefore the juice obtained in the first leaching is 
used for the second. 

THE PROCESS OF DIFFUSION. 

The operation is proceeded with as follows: First one cell is filled 
with cossettes and hot water (at 80° C.) admitted till the cell is filled. 
Assuming now that the beets contain 12 per cent, of sugar, an inter- 
change takes place, the cossettes giving up their sugar until only 6 per 
cent, remains, the other 6 per cent, having been taken up by the water. 
Meanwhile the next cell has been filled with cossettes, and the water 
containing 6 per cent, of sugar is now forced into it, having been heated 
in transit to 80 ° C. In this second cell again an interchange takes 
place, but the water containing already 6 per cent, sugar, will extract 
but half of the difference between the sugar in it and in the cossettes; this 
water will now contain 9 per cent, of sugar, and is forced into the third 
cell, where it will again absorb half the difference between its own sugar 







and the cossettes. The same process is continuea until the water has 
become sufficiently rich in sugar for evaporation. In the meantime fresh 
water has again been forced into the first cell and passes through the 
entire number of filled cells in regular order. When the cossettes in 
the first cell have become exhausted of their sugar by continued passage 
of fresh water, the contents are discharged through a trap door and 
replaced by a fresh charge, and cell No. I now becomes the last in the 
series. The second cell is next to be exhausted and recharged in its 
turn, and thus every following cell continuously. 

The exhausted cossettes. or pulp fall into a pulp basin, usually con- 
structed of cement, underneath the diffusion battery, and are carried 
through a helical press or screw conveyor, by which a portion of the 
water they contain is removed, to the outside of the building, where the 
beet pulp conveyor takes care of it. The water extracted by the press 
goes to waste. 



/ 

A new method has lately been devised by Dr. Pfeiffer and intro- 
duced in several German factories. By this method the diffusion cellsx 
are discharged by air pressure. Among the advantages claimed are 
quick discharge of the cells without hand labor, working at higher tem 
perature, thereby producing good and pure juices and leaving the pulp 
warm, enabling more rapid drying and pressing out of the pulp, hence^ 
a saving of fuel. 

BEET PULP CONVEYOR. 

This conveyor delivers the pulp to the cars or wagons or takes it 
to a place of storage. 

The cut on opposite page shows a Garland beet pulp conveyor as 
installed in many of our beet sugar plants. The illustration is repro- 
duced from a photograph taken at the plant of the Bay City Sugar Com- 
pany, Bay City. Mich. 

The pulp is discharged from the pulp press into the pulp house A, 
an extension projecting out from the main building. In this building 
is located the end of the cross line conveyor and the necessary wire-rope 
driving machinery. In the tower B is located the machinery which 
operates both conveyors. C is a steel power transmitting cable ^8 in. 
in diameter, spliced endless, 540 feet long. This cable receives its 
power from an 8-ft. wheel in the building A passing out over the idlers 
J and J and around the 8-ft. cable wheel K, which furnishes power 
to the bevel and spur gears to operate the entire driving machinery for 
the 250-ft. and 500-ft. lines of conveyor. The idlers J are arranged in 
vertical tension carriage, so the cable C may be tightened up at will or 
as may be required. 

In the first section is seen the 1-in. steel cable, on which the 
clamps E are spaced at intervals of 37.6 in. To each of these 
clamps is secured by two bolts a maple flight 18 j4 in. long and 6 
in. wide, which carries the pulp forward to |the tower B, where it is 
discharged into the 500-ft. line of conveyor F G H and conveyed to 
the pond. This cable E is 1 in. diameter, patent steel, and is coupled 
with a patent coupling. The breaking strain of the cable is thirty- 
seven tons, or 74,000 pounds. 

The object of the use of these large cables is that they afford a 
greater surface on which to grip the clamps. 

In the 500-ft. line at F may be seen the conveying cable, which is 
li/S in. diameter, patent steel, and spliced endless 1,021 feet 3 inches. 
The breakage strain of this cable is forty-seven tons, or 94,000 pounds. 
At G is shown one of the maple flights above described, which are 
spaced on this cable 37^ in. centers throughout its entire length. At 
H is lacated one of the 6-ft. cable wheels for 1 '^ in. cable. This wheel 
is arranged in tension carriage so that all slack cable may be taken up 
at will. The tension carriage in the first conveyor is located in the 
power house A. 

101 




D E is what is termed a pull conveyor, because the power is applied 
at the discharge end. 

CLARIFICATION OF THE JUICE. 

The juice as it leaves the last cell of the diffusion battery is drawn 
into a measuring tank, where it is accurately measured and a record 
taken of time, number of cell and density. The juice is then anything 
but inviting in taste, smell or appearance, which is due to the salts and 
organic impurities which it contains. The reason that the juice contains 
these non-saccharine substances is that all salts, partly bound to vege-

MECHANICAL FILTERS. 

table acids, as they are found in solution in the juice, diffuse almost as 
easily as the sugar in solution. To rid the juice of these impurities it 
is first passed through colorizators or heaters and then to the carbon- 
ators. In the colorizators the juice is heated to a temperature of about 
190° F. to cause coagulation of the albuminoids. The heating may be 
also accomplished by placing a steam coil in the carbonators. 

Firsf carbonation. The juice now passes into the first carbonators, 
large closed rectangular or cylindrical tanks with valves and appliances 
for admitting juice, lime and carbonic acid gas. Slaked lime in the 
form of milk of lime is introduced in the heated juice for the purpose of 

102 



having the lime unite with the impurities in the juice, both chemically 
and mechanically. In combining with the greater part of the impuri- 
ties this lime forms an insoluble precipitate, viz, , carbonate of lime, 
which is subsequently separated by filtration. The lime also combines 
with the sugar, forming a sucrate of lime. In order to separate the 
lime and sugar, carbonic acid gas is injected by means of a distributing 
arrangement placed at bottom of tanks. The gas bubbles through the 
lime juice, whereby a union of calcium and carbonic acid gas is effected, 
forming calcium carbonate. Great care must be taken not to admit 
more gas than is necessary to break up the combination of lime and 
sugar, for after this is accomplished the carbonic acid attacks other 
compounds of lime, and if allowed to operate too long would again set 
free all impurities. The process must, therefore, be closely watched 
and samples taken with a test tube every few seconds when the opera- 
tion approaches completion. The gas is instantly shut off as soon as 
by the formation of a granular precipitate, showing clear liquor between 
the particles, the completion of the process has been established. The 
juice drawn off from the first carbonators contains the precipitates and 
other mechanical impurities, and to rid the juice of them it is pressed 
through filter presses. 

The lime and carbonic acid gas required for the operation are pro- 
duced in specially constructed lime kilns. 

Lime Kiln. Most of the newer lime kilns are of long oval shape, 
constructed of steel and brick, with a lining of fire brick. The kiln 
should rest on an open iron grating, and not directly upon the ground, 
to allow of satisfactory circulation of air. The kiln is kept full of a 
mixture of coke and limestone, the former of about the size of a walnut 
and the latter a little larger. This limestone and coke is introduced at 
the the top by an elevator. The air enters at the bottom, where also 
the burned lime is withdrawn, which goes to the lime-slacking tanks ; 
the milk of lime, after being measured in a measuring tank, is forced 
by suitable pumps to the carbonation tanks before described. The gas 
is drawn from the top of the kiln by suitable mechanical devices and 
carried by pipes after passing through the carbonic acid gas washer. 
The amount of coke used depends mainly on the quality of the lime- 
stone, as does also the amount of carbonic acid gas obtained. In a 
well-constructed kiln, with good limestone, the average amount of coke 
used should not exceed eight pounds per 100 pounds of limestone. 

The object in burning the limestone in the factory instead of buy- 
ing the prepared lime is to make sure of fresh burnt lime, and, further- 
more, to secure the carbonic acid gas needed for the carbonation 
process, as well as the slacked lime as just explained. 

First Filtration. The juice is forced by means of pumps at a 
proper pressure per square inch through presses consisting of a series 

108 



WWf .^ 



of frames and screens. The purpose of the frame, a hollow iron square, 
is to receive and hold the lime precipitate. After being forced into the 
frames of the press the juice passes through a finely woven cloth filter 
into the screen, and from there the filtered juice passes through a cock 
in the screen to a trough. When the frames are completely filled with 
lime-precipitate the flow of juice into the presses is stopped. Hot 
water is then forced through the presses to wash out of the lime cake and 
filter cloths any juice left. The press is then opened and the lime cake 
removed and carried by means of a conveyor outside of the building. 
The aforementioned trough serves alao as a measuring tank for the wash 
water of the lime cakes. There are many filter presses in the market 
of widely varying patterns, for all of which points of special advantage 
are claimed. Among those which are said to have given the best satis- 
faction are the "Kroog," "Beeg," Selwig &'Lange, and the filter presses 
built in this country on the Dyer pattern by Wm. R. Perrin & Co. 
The cut below illustrates one of the latter. 




Although most of the impurities originally contained in the raw 
juice have been removed by the two processes just described, the puri- 
fied juice is not as yet fit for the evaporating process, as they still con- 
tain a considerable amount of lime left by the first carbonation and 
some impurities, which are apt to pass into the juice with the wash 
water. It is, therefore, necessary to subject the juice to a second car- 
bonation, and after this possibly to a third. 

Second Carbonation. The juice and the wash water from the filter 
presses is submitted in a second set of carbonators to the same process 
previously described, however, very little lime, if any, being added. 
The carbonic acid gas is passed through the juice until only a trace of 

104 



lime remains in it, which is determined by a test made by a standard 
acid with the aid of an indicator. In order to precipitate the double 
carbonate that may be in solution the juice is then boiled and forced 
through another set of filter presses. This second filtration has the 
same object as the first and is conducted in the same manner. 

CONTINUOUS CARBONATION. 

Lately quite a noticeable improvement has been made in the process 
of carbonating juice. For a number of years sugar manufacturers and 
chemists have been studying the question of continuous carbonatation. 
The problem was solved by the Societ6t6 Anonyme de Constructions 
M^caniques, de St. Quentin, France, who constructed a continuous 
carbonatation which_answered the requirements sought for a long time. 




The above cut shows the apparatus used in the working of this 
process as installed by E. , Salich & Cp. in the Washington State Sugar 
plant at Waverly, where it has been in successful operation for two 
campaigns. 

The construction of this apparatus is very simple, and consists 
either of two tanks communicating at the bottom or a single tank hav- 
ing a partition in the center, answering the same purpose as two tanks. 
The limed juice passes through heaters, where it is brought to the 
required temperature, into the first tank when two tanks are employed, 
or into the first compartment of a double tank. 

105 



On the second tank or the second compartment of the double tank 
a juice outlet is provided for. This outlet has the shape of an open 
kettle, and the flow of the juice can be watched constantly. The dis- 
tribution of the carbonic acid gas is placed at the bottom of each tank, 
or each compartment, and has a separate inlet valve. 

All that the man working around the carbonatation has to do is to 
regulate the inlet of the juice and the inlet of the carbonic acid gas to 
bring the juice to the right point of carbonatation. When the valves 
are fixed correctly and the factory runs smoothly, furnishing without 
interruption the necessary quantity of juice to the carbonatation, and if the 
lime kiln is so operated that there is no variation in the richness of the 
gas, the valves remain in the same position not only for hours, but for 
days, without any change. 

Should the arrival of the juice not be very regular or fluctuation 
occur in the carbonic acid gas, all that is necessary is to open or close 
more or less either the inlet of juice or inlet of gas, or both of them. 

As there is but very little work to do around this carbonatation, 
one man can easily attend to both first and second carbonatations. A 
further advantage is found in the easy cleaning of the apparatus, a sav- 
ing in limestone and carbonic acid gas, and also a saving of space for 
the plant. 

SULPHURING AND MECHANICAL FILTRATION. 

The clear strained juice from the carbonators, which is at this stage 
of light amber color and almost pure, is forced by pumps to the sul- 
phuring tanks or so-called "sulphiters," which are of the same general 
construction as the carbonators above described. By means of an air 
compressor sulphurous acid gas, obtained by burning sulphur in a fur- 
nace or gas generator, is forced into these tanks. 

The gas generator has two compartments, one being used at a time, 
so as to allow of cleaning without interrupting the process. Air is 
pumped into one end by an air pump over the burning sulphur, and the 
sulphuric acid gas produced goes out at the other end through pipes to 
the sulphuring tanks. 

The sulphurous acid acting on the juice decolorizes the latter, and 
also precipitates the remainder of the lime. The sulphuring is control- 
led by making tests of the alkalinity and by watching the color of the 
juice, which at the end of the operation closely resembles that of ordinary 
water. 

An innovation has lately been introduced in some German factories 
which it is claimed combines a number of advantages, such as uniform 
saturation, uniform alkalinity of the juice, easy filtration, a saving in 
material and labor, while accomplishing the result much more quickly. 
As will be seen from the drawing, the sulphuring, instead of being done 
in a number of tanks, takes place in a single apparatus, consisting of a 

106 




horizontal cylinder provided 
with a helical worm. The juice 
is forced through the opening at 
the top, and in its downward 
course passes through the per- 
forations in the worm in the 
form of spray, readily absorbing 
the counter current of sulphuric 
acid gas which is forced in the 
cylinder through the opening at 
the bottom, as the juice in the 
form of spray offers a larger sur- 
face for the action of the gas. 

After the sulphuring process 
the juice undergoes another fil- 
tering in mechanical filters. 
These filters consist of iron 
boxes supplied with bags on the 
inside. The manner in which 
these filters work is just the 
reverse of pouring a liquid in a bag and allowing it to filter through, for 
the juice filters from the outside of the bag to the inside and then flows 
over and out of the top of the filter. The bags are stretched over 
copper frames to prevent them from collapsing during the operation. 

A mechanical filter, patented by Hans Reisert, Cologne, has lately 
been put on the market, which it is claimed combines cheapness of the 
filtering medium, which is gravel, with great saving of time and of work- 
ing expenses. The apparatus consists of a cylindrical or prismatic 
tank with two partitions for perforated metal plates and wire netting 
fastened horizontally at a given distance from each other. The space 
between them is filled partly with fine gravel, through which the juice is 
filtered. The washing out of the filtering material is accomplished by 
introducing compressed air through pipes with a number of small open- 
ings in them under the surface of the filtering material, causing a vio- 
lent agitation of same, partly through the upward movement of the air 
and. partly through the back flow of water, and thereby separating the 
impurities from the filtering material. 

Similar to the just described apparatus is the Reinicke sand filter, 
consisting of several circular shelves arranged funnel shaped either hori- 
zontal or inclined. The juice is made to circulate through the sand 
from top to bottom, leaving behind on each shelf some of its impuri- 
ties. The sand is cleaned in a special funnel, into which it is carried 
together with the impurities, by means of a jet of water, the sand sett- 
ling while the impurities are carried off with the water. 

107 



The process of mechanical filtration completes the purification of 
the juice, which is then passed to the multiple effect evaporating appa- 
ratus for the purpose of concentration. 

CONCENTRATION OF THE JUICE. 

The concentration of the juice takes place in an evaporating appa- 
ratus or ftiultipie effect, consisting of three, four or more bodies, called, 
according to the number of bodies, double, triple, quadruple, etc., 
effects. The design of the multiple effect is to use the latent heat of the 
exhaust steam from the various engines of the sugar house and to evap- 
orate the juice at a low temperature. There are a great many types of 
evaporators, which may be divided according to their construction into 
two distinct classes, viz., upright and horizontal evaporators, most all 
of which work well when operated skillfully and where the juice reaches 
them in a proper condition for concentration. In as much as in any 
type of evaporator the heating surfaces are apt to become covered with 
matter deposited by the juices, it will readily be understood that the 
best satisfaction is obtained from those evaporators whose heating sur- 
faces are easily accessible for cleaning. 

Many of our manufacturers hitherto have given the vertical appa- 
ratus the preference, one principal reason being that the tubes are easy 
to clean. The juice being on the inside of them the scale deposited is 
easily removed, whereas in the horizontal effects the juice is outside of 
the tubes, and in order to clean them they have to be removed from the 
tube heads. 

In the best designed upright or so-called "Standard" evaporators 
each body is divided into two sections or chambers; the lower or steam 
chamber for the steam and the upper chamber, occupying about two- 
thirds of the space, for the juice and the vapors arising from the boiling. 
They are fitted with vertical copper tubes expanded into copper head 
sheets and a large central circulating tube, thus presenting a large 
amount of heating surface. The upper or vapor chamber of each effect 
is connected with the steam chamber of the next effect, so that the 
vapors of the boiling liquor can pass from one steam chamber to the 
next. The process is as follows: Steam is turned into the steam cham- 
ber of the first effect and boils the juice in that effect, the vapors arising 
from the steam chamber of the second effect go over and boil the juice 
in the third effect and so on until the boiling process goes on in all. By 
means of a vacuum pump attached to the condenser of the last (third, 
fourth, etc.) effect a vacuum of different degree is created in each, and 
the juice can readily be drawn from one to the other as desired. By 
carrying on the process under vacuum loss of sugar by excessive heat is 
prevented. When the juice in the last effect has reached the required 
point of density it is pumped out and carried over to the vacuum pan, 
where it is boiled to a grain. 

108 



Connected with the last body of the multiple effect is a catchall, the 
purpose of which is to prevent sugar losses by entrainment. The appa- 
ratus consists of a cylindrical cast iron box with vertical copper tubes 
expanded into heads and forming practically a small surface condenser. 
The principle on which this catchall works is as follows: As the vapors 
from the last body of the effect enter the catchall they come in contact 
with the tubes, which are cooled either by fresh water passing through 
them or the cool juice before it is drawn into the effect, and in this lat- 
ter case the catchall may also serve as a preliminary heater. The sud- 
den cooling of the vapors thus effected and the checking of current due 
to the enlarged area of the catchall causes a condensation of the vapors 
and a precipitation of water, which carries down with it any sugar that 
may have been drawn along and be suspended in the vapors. The 
water, together with the sugar, is drawn off at the bottom of the catchall, 
and may either flow back direct to the effect or first discharge into a tank. 

The principal point of difference between the vertical or upright, 
and the horizontal effects is the arrangement of the heating pipes. 




LONGITUDINAL VERTICAL SECTION OF A " LILLIE" EFFECT. 

109 




The best known multiple effect of the horizontal type is the "Well- 
ner-Jelineck. " It is of elongated shape, rounded off at the top, with 
steam chests at either end. The heating tubes, arranged in nests, 
extend loosely through beveled holes in the tube plates. The body of 
the effect is filled with juice only to a level extending just above the 
tubes, leaving a space about five times the volume of the juice, 
preventing boiling over of the juice, while the catchall connected with 
the effect prevents any drops of juice that may be carried up by the 
steam from being carried along out of the chamber. The steam for 
evaporation enters through valves, and by means of return boxes is 
made to pass through the tubes back and forth. 

A new type of horizontal effects is represented by the Lillie evap- 
orator, manufactured by the Sugar Apparatus Manufacturing Company 

of Philadelphia. 

The illustration on page 
109 shows a longitudinal ver- 
tical section of a Lillie effect. 
The slightly inclined evapor- 
ating tubes open into the steam 
chamber through a heavy tube 
plate some three inches thick, 
in which the tubes are firmly 
expanded, without annealing, 
and by which they are sup. 
ported. The other ends of 
the tubes are closed save for 
a minute air vent in each, 
and are not fastened or sup- 
ported in anyway, thus allow- 
ing for longitudinal expansion 
and contraction indepen- 
dently of the body of the 
effect, and preventing any 
possibility of strains due to 
differences of expansion be- 
tween the tubes and the body. 
This illustration shows 
the transverse view of the 
battery of evaporating tubes. 
Above the evaporating tubes 
is a row of distributing 
tubes, each having a slot along 
its upper surface. The front 
ends are closed and their rear 
ends open into the manifold

box on the tube plate. Above, below and on each side of the battery 
of tubes is a vapor space extending from the tube plate forward into 
the front vapor space. On the under side of the body is a wall, termed 
the float box, with which connects the suction of the circulating pump, 
a centrifugal pump underneath the apparatus. The operation is as fol- 
lows: Steam, live or exhaust 
(or vapor from a hotter effect), 
supplied to the steam cham- 
ber passes into the evaporat- 
ing tubes and is condensed 
by and causes evaporation 
from the juice to be concen- 
trated, which is circulated 
over the evaporating tubes by 
the circulating pump. The 
resulting water of condensa- 
tion flows back from the tubes 
into the steam chamber and 
through a pipe at the bottom, 
fitted with a trap to prevent 
escape of steam into the 
steam chamber of the next 
cooler effect. This passing 
of the water of condensation 
from effect to effect is an ad- 
vantage resulting in greater 
economy. 

The juice is forced into 
the evaporating chamber by 
means of the circulating pump 
and flows down over the 
evaporating tubes in form of 
a shower and collects in the 
float box, where it is taken 
up again by the circulating 
pump and forced back into 
the evaporating chamber. 
The process is repeated until 
the juice has reached the de- 
sired density in the last effect, 
from which it discharges into 
the receptacle provided for 
it. The density of the con- 

'Lillie" effect enlarged 100 per cent, by adding a . i • • ^i f

111 



levels and the movement of the liquor into the first effect and from 
effect to effect are all automatically controlled by the discharge valve 
of the last effect. 

An unique feature of the "Lillie" multiple effect is its capability 
of enlargement, which permits of increasing its original tube heating 
surface 50 % to 100 % at a comparatively small expense. 

The "Lillie" is in operation in many American and European fac- 
tories. Probably the largest quadruple effects ever built — (capacity 
of concentrating 500,000 gallons of juice 76 % in 24 hours) — have been 
built under the Lillie 'system. 

BOILING TO A GRAIN WITH VACUUM PAN. 

The intent and purpose of boiling under vacuum is to achieve the 
crystallization of the sugar contained in the juice, while keeping the 
more soluble parts in solution. There are two different methods of 
sugar boiling. One consists in continuing the process of evaporation 
until a hot concentrated sugar solution is obtained, which crystallizes 
during the cooling off; the other consists in obtaining the crystallization 
during the boiling process. The technical term for the former method 
is "boiling blank," while the latter is designated by the term "boiling 
grain." The difference between the two methods is the following: By 
the former a smaller quantity of crystals is obtained and a large quan- 
tity of syrup, while by the latter method a greater amount of crystals is 
obtained and less syrup. It is evident, therefore, that the latter is the 
more profitable and should be used exclusively for boiling first juices. 
Of course, in working up the syrups for the production of after products 
it is necessary to resort to the former method, since they contain non- 
sugar in such quantities as to prevent the formation of grain. The 
process of boiling is conducted as follows: By means of a pump the 
vacuum is produced. The juice is then admitted into the pan up to a 
certain level, while steam is admitted into the heating coils or pipes in 
the bottom of the pan, causing the juice to boil. The apparatus in 
which the concentrated juice is boiled to a thick crystallized mass, the 
so-called massecuite, is called the vacuum pan, and consists of a large 
hollow cylinder put together in sections. Formerly open pans were 
used, but they have been superceded everywhere by closed pans, pro- 
vided with air pumps and condensers. Originally vacuum pans were 
built almost exclusively of copper, but of late years cast iron has been 
used, only the heating coils being of copper. The latter are so ar- 
ranged as to prevent their vibrating during the boiling and allowing for 
expansion and contraction without strain. The pans are provided with 
condenser and catchall and a large vapor pipe leading from top of pan 
to condenser. This vapor pipe has an enlarged portion, forming a trap 
to catch any overflow, which can be returned to pan or tanks as desired. 
The pumps which make and maintain the vacuum, are connected with 

112 



the condenser, forming what is termed a "dry" vacuum. The pan has 
two so-called proof sticks, for removing and testing from lime to time a 
small quantity of the juice. There are also a number of eye-glasses 
arranged in different positions to enable the sugar boiler to keep a con- 
stant watch on the work going on inside the pan. A barometer and 
thermometer are also connected with the interior of the pan, indicating 
extent of vacuum and temperature of contents. 

As soon as the juice has boileddown to string proof, steam pressure 
is decreased, reducing the temperature about ten degrees. Through 
the reduced tension more steam is produced, and hence a further con- 
centration of the juice, and at the same time a lowering of the tempera- 
ture. The juice not being able to absorb more sugar, part of same is 
separated from the juice in form of crystals. 

When an increase in quantity and size of the crystal is no longer 
observable more juice is admitted. This addition, instead of starting 
new grains, deposits on the first. Care must be taken that not too much 
fresh juice is admitted at one time, as otherwise the crystals already 
formed would dissolve again. The admission of fresh juice is continued 
until the pan is full, when its contents are passed into the mixer by 
means of a large valve situated in the bottom of the pan. There are 
various forms of pans, the main difference in their construction being in 
the heating device, in the older ones copper coils being used, while the 
newer inventions replace same by a pipe system. The question which 
of these is the most efficient seems to be still an open one. It has been 
shown in European factories, for instance, that the same amount of 
massecuite was boiled in the older cone-shaped coil vacuums of about 
6 m. diamiter in two hours less than in those of the newer construction 
with a smaller diameter. On the other hand, it is claimed that the 
quality of a strike is not improved by quick boiling. A vacuum boiling 
quickly is desirable, but quick boiling in itself is bad, and for the fol- 
lowing reasons: While it is possible to force the crystallization of the 
thick juice in the pan,, the sugar crystals thus produced cann.ot be forced 
to combine with the crystal previously obtained. This latter process 
requires time. If sufficient time is not allowed, then the conditions for 
satisfactory crystallization of the juice are lacking, and the result will 
show itself in the smaller amount of first product obtained. It would, 
therefore, seem advisable not to try and hasten the boiling. The aim of 
the inventors of the newer apparatus has been to produce a pan with 
as large heating surface as possible, while limiting the time of boiling. 
To the latter class of vacuums used now in many Continental factories 
belongs the one invented by "Rohrig & Konig." It is constructed 
similar to an upright syrup tank, but with a conic wrought iron double 
bottom, having a circulation pipe in the middle of the steam chamber, 
provided with an agitator. Besides there are two arms close to the 
double bottom for the purpose of evenly distributing the thick juice. 

113 




It 



The pipes are thus arranged so as to insure a large heating surface, 
which can be laid quite deep. As a consequence the boiling with steam 
of low tension (0.1 to 0.3 Atm.) is possible, and on account of the deep 
level of the heating surface the formation of the grain can commence 
with a relatively small quantity of.juice (sayjone-quarter of the contents 




115 



of thi paa), aa achievement not reached by other construction. The 
boiling is much simpler than with coil vacuums, it is claimed, and the 
grain obtained very even and large. The heating pipes in this pan are 
of brass or steel. 

In the vacuum pan constructed by Wm. Greiner, Brunswick, the 
heating coils were originally arranged in a manner that the massecuite 
would always be carried again downward through an inner slot. This 
slot, however, was found incapable of carrying the heavy, slow-moving ^ 
downward. On the newer apparatus the outer pipes are, therefor^massj^ 
thus arranged that they can be cut off at will. As long as thick juice is 
drawn off they remain inactive and are only put in operation later on, 
and thus in the main and auxiliary system all kinds of steam can be 
used for heating. It is claimed for this vacuum that the appearance of 
irregular grain during the boiling in the vacuum, due to the lack of sys- 
tematic circulation of the massecuite, is done away wiih. Through the 
temporary cutting off of heating bodies the downward pressure is suffi- 
ciently increased to overcome the upward pressure produced in the axis 
of the cylinder vacuum. 

Among other pans in favor with sugar houses may be mentioned 
the Wellner-Jelinck system pan, built by the Maschinenfabrik Groven- 
broich; the pan of the Halle'sche Maschinenfabrik; the " Hercynia 
Vacuum System, Rassmus; the Rillieux, the Heckmann and the 
Hallstroem. 

STEAM TRAPPING. 

The use of steam for boiling purposes in the factory is not as well 
understood as it should be, nor does it have the care and consideration 
that it merits. The reasons for this it is needless now to discuss, but 
an effort will be made here to explain the importance of this subject and 
show the best methods to follow in order to give steam controlled appli- 
ances their highest efficiency. It has repeatedly been demonstrated by 
elaborate experiments that when steam is allowed to blow from the tail 
pipes of a vacuum pan there is a loss in heat units of from 50 to 90 % 
(dependent upon the actual character of the discharge), and that there 
is, furthermore, a loss of temperature in the pan amounting in frequent 
cases to as much as 25 ° or 30 ° ; that is, if the steam blows from the tail 
pipes it is not only wasteful to the extent stated, but the contents of the 
pan are not kept as hot as they should be by many degrees. It is, 
therefore, essential to the best work that the tail pipes be properly con- 
trolled, and the accompanying drawings indicate a correct installation 
of Heintz's thermostatic traps for this purpose. 

Until a few years ago it was the custom to attach all the tail pipes 
from the pan to the main drip line, which in turn was connected to a 
steam trap, one of the many forms of mechanical traps being ordinarily 

116 



employed for this purpose. The effect of this construction was that 
either the trap had to be allowed to blow more or less steam in order to 
keep all the coils free from condensation, or this condensation backed into 
several of the coils so as to greatly impair their efficiency and prolong the 
operation of the pan unnecessarily. The usage now, however, calls for 
the employment of a Heintz thermostatic trap on each tail pipe, and the 
drawings on pages 114 and 115 give the first presentation that has ever 
been published of this method of handling condensation. The results of 
this construction are threefold: It makes the maintenance of an even 
temperature in the pan certain; it increases the output of the pan and 
secures an economy of fuel that is calculated to approximate 25 %. 

In explanation of the drawings it must be borne in mind that when 
the condensation first sets up in the coil it has a temperature closely 
approaching that of the steam itself, and for this reason some pipe is 
required to serve as a cooling coil between the end of the tail pipe and 
the Heintz traps. That the length of this cooling coil may be kept 
within reasonable proportions, and with the further purpose of being 
able to practically vary the length of this cooling coil as circumstances 
may demand, one of the prominent sugar house engineering firms has 
devised a coil tank, which is shown properly connected on the same 
pages. A little study of the plans will indicate that whenever the vol- 
ume of condensation is heaviest, calling for greater length of cooling 
coil, this is obtained by increasing the flow of water through the cool- 
ing tank, and vice versa, when the contents of the vacuum pan are cold- 
est the maximum amount of water will be passed through the cooling 
tank, and as the operation progresses the volume of passing water can 
be reduced as may be necessary. It is possible with the arrangement 
of tail pipes and cooling tank, with the addition of a gauge glass placed 
on one of the tail pipes close to the vacuum pan, to keep the entrained 
water in the coils at practically the same level during the entire operation. 

It will readily be seen that this cooling tank not only performs the 
office explained above, but it also makes an extremely satisfactory feed- 
water heater that may be used either alone or as an adjunct to another 
feed water heater. If it is required that the coils in the vacuum pan be 
instantly freed of their steam, the valves on the end of each scale leg are 
opened after the steam has been shut down and the pipes will be 
instantly discharged. 

This method of controlling the drip lines from the coils is, unques- 
tionably, the most satisfactory that has yet been devised, and the results 
obtained explain the popularity which it is obtaining. It must be 
remembered, however, that the correct size of cooling coil to employ is 
determined largely by the steam pressure in use on the pan -the higher 
the pressure the longer the coil. The manufacturers of the Heintz trap 
probably give precise data on this point for any steam pressure.

THE MIXER. 

This apparatus is employed to allow the sugar from the vacuum 
pan to cool slowly and to then feed it to the centrifugals. It consists of 
a large V-shaped trough made of steel, with cast iron heads and par- 
tioned off in such a manner that it can be used for straight pans and 
seconds at the same time. 

A shaft runs through it provided with arms for the purpose of keep- 
ing the boiled juice, or so-called "melada," from solidifying. This 
boiled juice, of the appearance of a thick paste, passes to the centrifu- 
gals directly below through short spouts, which are regulated by means 
of a tight-fitting gate. 

THE CENTRIFUGALS. 

A charge of boiled juice of about 200 pounds is admitted into the cen- 
trifugals machine, which is set revolving at the rate of 1,000 revolutions 
per minute. At the expiration of about ten minutes the molasses is 
thrown off and the sugar adhering to the sides of the centrifugal 
removed. Thus the operation is completed and the pure white sugar 
now left falls through a trap door situated in the bottom of the cen- 
trifugal and is taken by means of a conveyor to the sugar elevator, which 
in turn delivers it to the dryer or granulator, while another elevator con- 
veys the brown sugar to the melting room. The best known types of 
centrifugals are the Hepworth and the Weston. 

The distinctive feature of the Hepworth type of self-balancing cen- 
trifugal is the hanging outer casing held in a fixed relation to the revolv- 
ing basket, so that one cannot swing independently of the other. The 
tendency of the casing to remain at rest prevents the basket from wob- 
bling or swaying and urges it to revolve around its center, while the 
contents wall up evenly on all sides. 

When the walling up is not perfectly even, the revolving parts do 
not turn about the center of the basket, the lower end of the spindle 
describes a circle, and the casing is forced to take up a corresponding 
circular motion. It is sometimes objected that considerable power must 
be required to set up and maintain such motion, but this is a mistake, 
for the motion is rarely of appreciable extent, and is never very consid- 
erable. The Hepworth effects a constant saving of friction, and, there- 
fore, of power, through not requiring the washers in the supporting 
bearing to be made large enough to allow a supporting bolt to pass 
through their centers. 

As first made the Hepworth centrifugals and their accessories were 
somewhat complicated and inaccessible in some of their details, but 
these objections have been wholly overcome by the improvements of 
recent years. One of the notable improvements enables the friction 
driving pulleys to be adjusted or provided with new friction linings 

118 



without so much as stopping the shaft which supports them, and another 
makes the adjustment of the guide pulleys a matter of ease and cer- 
tainty even to the unskilled. 

As bearing on the matter of pulleys it should be noted, however, 
that the Hepworth machines are now made to dispense with these by 
substituting the water drive when the latter is preferred, but the makers 
believe that their latest improved belt drive is less troublesome and 
more effective than the water drive. The latter consists of an impulse 
wheel at the top of the centrifugal spindle, driven by water from a 
pump, and a system of pipes and tanks to deliver the water to the wheel 
and return it to the pumps, so as to be repeatedly used. 




The above illustration shows an eight machine set of the new 40 "X 
24" Weston Patent Centrifugal Machines, built by the American Tool and 
Machine Company, of Boston, as installed in many of the newer beet 
sugar factories in this country. The machine is noted for the excellence 
of its product from first sugars, which is due to the short time required 
to bring the machine from a state of rest to full speed. 

Owing to the improved method of hanging the spindle will work 
equally well on first or on wagon sugars, and, with the self-balancing 
feature and greater stability of the basket, the machine will run steadier 
than ever. 

All bearings, including idler and friction pulley, are provided with 
self-oiling arrangements, which, with the simplicity and durability of 
the machine, allow continued operation with a minimum of attention. 
The machine is very light running, requiring less horse-power to run it 
for the amount of work performed than any machine on the market, it 
is claimed. 

To facilitate the rapid discharge of the load a large opening is pro- 

119 



vided in the bottom of the basket, and the valve covering the same is 
simple, durable and tight and easily replaced when necessary. All bas- 
kets are securely banded and are made of bronze with a brass sheet. 
As a brass sheet does not deteriorate, it always retains its full strength, 
and the machine can be run at the highest speed with safety. 

Another type of centrifugal machine of American invention is the 
Lafferty. 

DRYING THE SUGAR. 

The drying of the sugar is accomplished in a granulating machine. 
The granulators installed in most of our factories are of what is known 
as the '^Hersey type. The apparatus consists of a circular steel shell, 
having small shelves or wings attached to its interior sides, revolving 
on trucks. A steam drum is located centrally within the shell, extend- 
ing its entire length, and an exhaust fan is connected by means of a 
pipe at the upper or higher end of the machine, while a heatef com- 
posed of a series of steam pipes is located at the lower end. The opera- 
tion of the machine is as follows: The wet sugar as it comes from the 
centrifugals is fed automatically into the upper end, and as the shell 
slowly revolves the inner shelves pick up the sugar and drop it on the 
steam drum, from which it slides to the bottom, to be picked up again 
and dropped upon the steam drum. At the same time the heated air 
which is being drawn in by the exhaust pipe comes in contact with the 
descending sugars and absorbs and carries off the moisture. The pur- 
pose of the arrangement is to cause the sugar to pass through the entire 
length of the apparatus without staying too long in any one part, thus 
preventing the danger of burning. 

The dry sugar is discharged at the lower end of the machine, where 
another elevator receives it and delivers it to the screens for grading it. 
Then it is passed through spouts according to its grade into barrels or 
bags. The barrels are placed upon shakers, so that the sugar is thor- 
oughly settled into them, and when they are filled they can be headed 
and are ready for shipment or storage. 

Some granulators are built without the inner steam drum, in place 
of which a greater amount of heating coils is substituted for heating the 
air which is sucked into the granulator. 

In many of the larger factories the system of double drying — (New- 
hall patent) — is used. The sugar is partially dried in a Hersey drier, 
the so-called upper drum, from which it passes before any dust is 
formed into the lower drum or granulator, where the drying operation 
is completed. The effect of this is to prevent the dust from reaching 
the crystals and adhering to them while damp, and the result is a bright, 
sparkling and attractive looking sugar. 

120 



WORKING UP AFTER PRODUCTS. 

The syrup or molasses obtained from the first product as above 
described is collected in tanks, and when a sufficient quantity has accu- 
mulated is sent back and boiled again in the vacuum pan (so-called sec- 
ond pan), but not boiled to a grain. When it has reached the desired 
consistency it is run into crystallizers of the same capacity as the vacuum 
pan, which consists of large, boiler-shaped vessels, supplied on the 
outside with a water jacket to allow of cooling when necessary. A 
slowly revolving shaft on the inside, provided with arms, keeps the 
massecuite in constant motion, whereby the cooling is effected. By 
t his process a bro wn_siigar, the so-called second product, is obtained. 
This process is called '■Crystallization in movement,'' one of the most 
important modern improvements in sugar house work. It was first 
introduced about a decade ago by Dr. Johannes Bock in conjunction 
with the Machinenfabrik Grevenbroich. The principle on which the 
process is based is the increased rapidity of crystallization caused by 
movement of crystals in its solution. It has revolutionized the work of 
treating the massecuite and takes the place of the old method of keep- 
ing the after products (syrups of low purity) in large tanks or wagons to 
crystallize out while at rest. Its salient features are: A quicker, 
cheaper and cleaner method of working, resulting in a larger yield of 
sugar of a better quality and a less yield of molasses; no danger of 
inversion from heating, which is prevented by cooling, and the avoid- 
ance of an after campaign involving a large expense of labor and fuel to 
work up the sugar remaining in tanks weeks after the close of the main 
campaign. 

The syrup or drains left from the first operation are again sent back 
and reboiled in the vacuum pan and run into crystallizers, whence they 
emerge as brown sugar, the so-called third product. 

All this brown sugar, which is very unpalatable, is melted in a mixer 
and worked in with the green juice in the first pan. 

Quite a number of apparatus have been devised for crystallizing 
sugar in motion. The Wulff crystallizers and their many variations, 
the apparatus of Dr. Paul Degener and W. Grenier and the "Bergreen" 
are based on the principle of crystallization in motion. In the **Grosse," 
"Freitag" and "Sachs" processes crystals are formed either in the 
vacuum pan or partially in the pan and in crystallizers. In most of our 
factories crystallizers built on the Bock patent are used. 

The new improved Eastwick crystallizer, as shown on Page 122, is 
found in many factories. It consists of a braced cylindrical shell with two 
internal curved shelves. The shell is supported on two rings, one near 
each end, which revolve on two pairs of roller wheels, and is set in 
motion by a worm gear driven by puUy and belt. 

The crystallizer is filled by means of a charge valve, preferably to 

121 



a height about eighteen inches from the top, though it may be com- 
pletely filled if desired. As soon as the crystallizer is charged the 
charge valve is closed and motion begun. The cylinder revolves at the 
velocity of about one revolution every eight or ten minutes. 

As the cylinder revolves the curved shelves, which are inside and 
practically form buckets against the sides, pick up the massecuite as 
they pass through the lower position and discharge it when in the upper 
position, thus causing a thorough mixture of the massecuite and move- 
ment of the grain in the solution without any destruction to the grain, 
while at the same time the temperature of the mass is controlled by the 
steam coils shown underneath the shoe and the cooling apparatus above. 

The cooling apparatus is very simple. The water jacket employed 
in other apparatus has been done away with, and the cooling is effected 
by wetting the outside of the shell, only sufficient water being used to 
dampen the shell and not to have water drip on the floor; the evapora- 
tion of the water causes a rapid decrease of temperature. 




DESUGARIZING MOLASSES. 

The molasses finally left is of a very low grade, and in many fac- 
tories is allowed to go to the sewer or is run into the pulp. It might 
be used for manufacturing vinegar or blacking, but the former way of 
disposing of it is a hardly justifiable waste method, while the latter only 
pays poorly. The only proper thing to do is to take the sugar out of 
the molasses by some approved method. This molasses usually amounts 
to about :3 to 4 per cent, of the sugar content of the beet. In some fac- 
tories this molasses is stored in tanks and allowed to stay in them until 
the next season, when such sugar as has settled to the bottom is taken 
out and worked over. Of course, this is rather a primitive and unsatis- 
factory method. 

Many methods, based on different principles, such as Osmosis, 

123 



Elution, Substitution, Separation, Strontian, etc., have been devised 
and new ones are constantly brought out. 

The various ^'■elutiorC^ processes, as devised by Scheibler, Stammer, 
Manoury and others, have not proven a success and are now-a-days in 
operation but in a few foreign factories. 

The Strontian process^ while admittedly a valuable one and furnish- 
ing a very pure product, has several drawbacks. In the first place the 
very high cost of installation, amounting according to its size to say 
one quarter to one half million of dollars ; secondly the difficulty of ob- 
taining Strontianite in ready quantities at reasonable prices, and thirdly 
the fact, that it would hardly pay even for large factories, unless they 
could secure the molasses from other factories to be worked up with 
their own. 

The substitution process invented by Charles Steffen, has been al- 
together superseded by the separation process of the same inventor. 
The new and improved Steffen process is at present occupying the at- 
tention of all sugar men and as far as the gain of sugar is concerned 
according to the results of the many European factories, in which it has 
been introduced, seems to accomplish more than any other desugarizing 
process. In this process the thinned out molasses is passed with great 
speed under sufficient pressure through noozles, dividing the liquid into 
cohorent sprays or layers into a closed cylinder, called the "reaction 
chamber,'' where it is brought in contact with a stream of air, well mixed 
with finely pulverized lime. This lime-air is kept in constant circulation 
by means of exhaustors. The openings are arranged in such a manner 
that the sprays or layers flow through a stretch of the chamber, until 
they reach the outlet openings situated in the direction of the current 
and again pass out as closed layers or sprays through the openings from 
the reaction chamber with the velocity they have attained. The lime is 
fed in uniform quantities. . The sugar solution coming in contact with 
the lime-charged air, part of the lime and sugar combine and are pre- 
cipitated in the form of sucerate of lime, while the surplus lime is 
returned to circulation. The operation is repeated until all the sugar 
appears precipitated as insoluble sucerate of lime or tribasic lime-sugar, 
which is easily separated from the liquid, the latter retaining all the dis- 
solved organic or mineral non-sugar. The separation of the sucerate of 
lime from the mother liquor is accomplished by a new method of filter- 
ing in specially constructed filter presses, such filtering simultaneously 
effecting the washing out of the sucerate of lime. 

The molasses to be treated by thining out with water on the one 
hand and with wash lye on the other hand is reduced to liquids of dif- 
ferent non-sugar contents, the liquid having the smallest non-sugar 
contents, remaining last in the filter-presses. In this manner more than 
96 % of the sugar introduced to the process are obtained as saccharates 
of a purity of from 95 to 97 %. A further advantage of this method is 

128 



found in working the syrup of the second product with quotient of 66-67 
or higher and that it becomes unnecessary to make molasses or to resort 
to complicated methods to work up second products. 

A beet sugar factory to produce white granulated will only have to 
boil two massecuits. The first product massecuit for the production of 
granulated and the second product massecuit from the wash syrup of 
the first for yellow grain sugar. The first massecuit consists of the 
diffusion juice which goes to the carbonators with the saccharate of 96% 
purity obtained by the wash process just described and the yellow sugar 
(polarizing 9.5) obtained in the swing out of the second massecuit boiled 
to a grain. The thin juice from the filter presses goes to the second 
carbonation with ^% lime, added in the form of sucerate of lime and 
passes from there to the third carbonation where it is sulphered until 
nearly neutral. The sulphured juice passes over Danek filters into the 
evaporators and then in the vacuums. The first massecuit is quickly 
boiled to a grain, six hours sufficing for this boiling. The boiled masse- 
cuit is then centrifuged. From the centrifugals three syrups are obtained, 
the first and second of which are boiled to a grain in specially con- 
structed vacuums, while the third is returned to the second carbonation. 
These vacuums arc constructed in a manner keeping the massecuit while 
it is being boiled to a grain constantly agitated. The boiling is com- 
menced with the second syrup so as to start the formation of the grain 
(crystals); the first syrup is gradually added till the boiling is completed, 
which requires from 24 to 28 hours. When the second product is thus 
finished in the boiling it is centrifuged, returning a beautiful large 
grained yellow sugar polarizing 95 by about 90 rendement. 

The wash syrup of the yellow sugar has a purity coefficient of 64 to 
66 and as already described, is returned to the first and second carbona- 
tion. In this manner 90 to 92 % of beautiful white crystallized sugar 
(granulated) is obtained out of 100% sugar in the beet — in other words 
the manufacturer gets pretty near all the sugar that can be obtained 
from the beet. Furthermore, in addition to its highly satisfactory 
results both as regards quantity and quality of the refined product it 
furnishes, it compares most favorably in simpleness of manipulation and 
in point of cost, (installation and running expenses) with any other 
method now in use. 

The Osmose process, as originally invented by Dubrunfant and which 
is still used in many of the smaller factories in Europe, requires compa- 
ratively speaking a very small investment and small running expenses, 
but the results are likewise limited. But not only is the amount of 
sugar obtainable by the old Osmose process limited, even if the osmos- 
ing operation is extented, there will always be left a considerable 
amount of osmosed molasses. Another drawback of this method is 
that the beet juices into which the osmose product is introduced are 
more or less unfavorably affected as regard purity and color. 

124 



These drawbacks have been practically overcome by the Vallez 
Triple Osmose Process, recently invented and already introduced in a 
number of our beet sugar factories. In its general instruction the Vallez 
triple osmose process very much resembles the well-known construction 
of osmose apparatus. In the Vallez osmogenes the total number of 
frames is divided into three equal parts and each of the three parts acts, 
so to say, as a separate apparatus; the molasses entering the osmogenes 
at one end, the water at the other. 

The total number of frames are, as mentioned above, separated into 
three equal parts by a specially constructed frame which conducts the 
liquids from one compartment to the next. This permits a more com- 
plete purification of the molasses; the molasses entering one end of the 
apparatus encounters the water already charged, to a certain extent, 
with impurities, and upon arriving at the last compartment, from where 
the molasses leaves the apparatus, it is brought in contact with fresh 
water which naturally has a greater action on the molasses which has 
been partly purified in the previous compartments. Thus, more salts 
can be eliminated from the molasses with less water, resulting in a 
higher purity of the osmosed molasses, and lower purity of the osmose 
water. 

The osmose apparatus being divided into three compartments, each 
compartment acting as a separate osmogene, the circulation of both 
liquids is better, as they are more evenly distributed into the different 
frames. The natural consequenc of this circulation is a more complete 
and even utilization of the parchment paper, which will resist longer 
and at the same time give better results. 

PULP. 

A vexing problem which has confronted many factories in the past 
was, what to do with the pulp, which amounts to about 50 per cent, of 
the tonnage of beets worked up in a factory. Our farmers are just now 
beginning to appreciate the value of this pulp as a stock food. Experi- 
ments along the line have shown that for fattening hogs and cattle, feed- 
ing lambs and the dairy cow, this pulp offers a valuable and cheap food. 
At one dollar a ton it would be cheap, and in such parts of the country 
where there are large dairy or stock feeding industries the factories have 
found no difficulty of disposing of the pulp at from 35 cents to 111. 00 per 
ton, the farmers furnishing the beets to the factory as a rule being glad 
to take such share as represented by the total of their beet deliveries at 
an agreed upon price to be deducted from the price they received for the 
beets. This pulp may be siloed with a sprinkling of salt and loses none 
of its virtue for a couple of years after it is siloed. It has been claimed 
on basis of tests that better results are obtained from siloed pulp than 
from the fresh pulp, /. e. when fed coming direct from the mill; further- 
more that such pulp fed to cattle makes a firmer, tenderer and better 

125 



colored beef. The value for the dairy may be better understood from 
the following figures: Calculating the value on a basis of units of feeding 
value, allowing three units for proteine, two units for fatty substances 
and one unit for substances free from mitrogen, this pulp would repre- 
sent 44 units of feeding value. 

Pulp driers, which form part of the installation in all European 
factories are now being introduced in some of our factories. These 
driers are constructed similar to a granulator. The pulp is cut into small 
pieces and forced by means of pumps through filterpresses after sufficient 
water having been added to enable the pumps to handle it. From the 
presses it passes into the drier, then to a set of rollers where it is ground 
as fine as bran. It is then bagged or baled for shipment. Ready market 
for the product which can be sold at $8.00 and more per ton at factory 
is found abroad. The installation (including filterpresses, pumps, 
etc.,) for a 500 ton factory would amount to about $16,000. Additional 
cost of building $5,000. The total cost for fuel, labor, bags, etc., in- 
cluding interest is given as about $55.00, while the product obtained out 
of 600 tons ordinary pulp is 29 tons. 

COST OF SUGAR AND PROFIT CALCULATION. 

'^ The cost of the sugar and the profit to the factory depend on the 

conditions already partly discussed under the heading "Factory require- 
ments", the amount of materials used, price of beets and wages paid, 
and duration of campaign. Fuel, limestone and wages are the three 
principal expense items in a sugar factory, and run about as follows per 
ton of beets: 

Cents per ton 
of Beets. 

Coal (basis 8-fold evaporating power) 12 per cent., at $3.00 per ton 36 

Limestone (basis 95 per cent, of pure lime) 10 per cent., at $1.60 per ton ... .16 

Wages, (basis full season of 100 days) 160 hands at $2.50 average wages 80 

In a factory of a daily capacity of 500 tons, where coal, or lime- 
stone, or wages would be 25 or 50 per cent, higher, the expenses during 
a season would be increased in the following amounts: 

25 per Cent. 50 per Cent. 

Coal $ 4,500 $ 9,000 

Limestone 2,000 4,000 

Wages 10,000 20,000 

A difference oi 1}4 per cent, in the quality of the beets, that is to 
say, the real outturn of granulated would make a difference of ten 
pounds of sugar per ton of beets, or (on basis of a price of 5 cents per 
pound) $25,000 per season. 

From this it will readily be seen that the factor which mainly deter- 
mines the cost of the sugar is a full supply of beets of good quality. 

126 



The total daily average expenses per ton of beets may be calculated as 
follows: 

Per Ton of Beets. 
Beets, at $4.00 per ton $4.00 

Coal, 12 per cent, at $3.00 per ton 36 

Limestone, 10 per cent, at $1.60 per ton 16 

Wages, at $2.50 80 

Coke and other materials, such as chemicals, lubri- 
cants, etc 75 

$6.07 
Making for 50,000 tons worked up in a season of 100 

days $303,500 

To which would have to be added the general or 
annual expenses for office, selling and travelling 
expenses, insurance, repairs, stationery and 

incidentals, in round figures 50,000 

Total $353,000 

On an outturn of say 10 per cent., or 10,000,000 
pounds of granulated the factory would receive 

at an average net price of 5 cents per pound $500,000 

Adding to this the value of pulp and molasses at, 

say 50 cents per ton 25,000 

Total receipts would amount to $525,000 

Less total expense as above , 353,500 

Profit $171,500 

The value of the residue in pulps and molasses viz: 1200 lbs. of pulp 
and 20 lbs. of molasses, has been calculated at 50 cents per ton of beets, 
which is considerable less than actual value, as shown in previous 
chapters. 

The price of beets, $4.00 per ton, represents the average price gen- 
erally paid by our factories. The other daily expense items for materials 
and labor, will in most cases be found below our figures. 

The price of coal varies greatly in the different states, but the figure 
of $3.00, taken as basis for above calculation, is rather above the average. 
The amount of coal consumed is by far a more important factor than the 
price of coal. As already referred to in a previous chapter, in modern 
European factories V5 lbs. of steam per 100 lbs. granulated is not an 
unfrequent figure. This means that with coal of 7,000 to 7,600 calories 
or about eight fold evaporating power, the consumption amounts to only 
about 9 % coal per ton of beets. 

Hence, if as has been the case in some factories in this country, 
23 % of coal are used, this means a difference of 14 % or 7,000 tons; in 
other words, at $3.00 per ton, $21,000 worth of coal would be needlessly 
burned up. This difference amounts to ^Vir* o"^ say ^ cent for pound of 
granulated sugar just for the item "Coal." It will therefore be seen 
that the amount of coal consumed cuts a much more important figure, 
than the factor "price of coal," since an increase in the price of coal of 
$1.00 per ton, would increase the cost of production only jjfo^ cent, per 
lb. granulated sugar. 

127 



Of course just as much depends on the quality of the coal, than the 
boiler plant and evaporating apparatus, and last, but not least, the way 
they are run. In this connection a few words in regard to boiler plants. 

In deciding on the boiler plant, the following vital points should be 
considered, viz: Simplicity in construction, accessibility for cleaning 
and inspection and easy and quick repairing in case of accident. 

A very important improvement introduced in modern boiler plants 
consist in an automatic feeding device of the furnaces, whereby the coal 
is delivered directly from bins placed above the boilers into hoppers and 
fed regularly to the fires by means of automatic smoke consuming 
stokers. These bins generally have a storage capacity to feed the fur- 
naces for a period of not less than 24 hours without refilling. Mechan- 
ical cross conveyors in direct connection with the coal storage sheds of 
suitable capacity, generally not less than 100 cars, are used for filling 
the bins and also for removing the ashes, dumped from the ashpits, 
from the boiler house to an elevator which takes them up to a receiving 
bin, from which they are spouted off into cars or carts to be hauled 
away. This process involves great economy not only in the amount of 
coal used, but also in the handling of the coal and ashes. 

A fuel economizer placed in the smoke flue between the boilers and 
the shack is another important improvement of a modern boiler plant. 

In previous chapters attention has already been drawn to the neces- 
sity of economizing in steam andtvater. The consumption of water depen- 
ding of course upon size of factory runs into the millions of gallons. 
Where the factory is located in near proximity to a river or lake front, 
economy in quantity of water used is not of such vital importance, than 
in such cases where the factory has to rely for its suply on artesian wells. 
It is not an uncommon occurrence that wells become suddenly dry, 
hence the water system should always be arranged with a view of econo- 
mizing as much as possible. There are a number of methods, and new 
ones are constantly devised whereby the total quantity of water con- 
summed is considerably reduced by returning to the factory all the 
diffusion and beetwasher water, after it has been cleansed of its impuri- 
ties. This question of economizing in steam and water has of course a 
direct bearing on the cost of the sugar, hence should be carefully looked 
into by the factory builder. 

As regards wages, the figure of $2.50, taken as average wages, is 
certainly higher than in most localities. Every quarter of a dollar more 
or less in average wages represents an additional or reduced expendi- 
ture of $4,000 for season, or y*^ cent per pound of granulated sugar. 

From the foregoing tables it will be seen, that a factory working up 
annually 50,000 tons of beets, yielding 200 pound of granulated sugar 
from each ton of beets, can produce such white granulated sugar at a 
cost of 3.29 cents per lb. There are factories in the U. S. who have 

128 



obtained 240 lbs. and even more of sugar from each ton of beets, because 
the beets were exceptionally rich in sugar and furthermore owing to 
expert and competent management.

Campaign duration, also a factor in deciding the cost of the sugar 
depends of course primarily on the beet supply, hence the factory 
management should see to it that there is never any lack of beets. 
The beet sheds should be built large enough to hold a supply of a 
couple of weeks so as to provide for emergencies in case unforseen cir- 
cumstances — (for inst. sudden change in weather making roads impass- 
able) — should cause a temporary stoppage in the deliveries by the con- 
tracting farmers. In order to make a factory pay well, the campaign 
should be condensed in the smallest possible space of time, the factory 
working continuously at its fullest capacity. From the moment the 
factory is started, in other words from the first day beets are sliced, until 
the last day of the campaign the factory must work without stoppage. 
A side from the fact, that the running expenses will be proportionately 
increased through the drawing out of a campaign, there is the additional 
danger of the juice in the waiting tanks fermenting. For this and other 
reasons it is out of question to close the factory even on Sundays. 
To prevent serious losses it must be kept running day and night and 
from start to finish of campaign. 

As already mentioned in a previous chapter in some states a bounty 
is granted to the beet sugar factories, part of which goes to the beet 
grower and part to the sugar factory, and, of course, correspondingly in- 
creases the profit. But as the foregoing figures and the experience of 

120 



the factories in such states as have no bounty law conclusively proves, 
the beet sugar industry is not dependent on such state aid, which at best 
can only by temporary. 

CONCLUSION. 

The beet sugar industry is still in its infancy and both in the field 
work and factory work much will have to be done yet, before the best 
results will be obtainable. In fact we may be said to be still in the 
experimental stage. Although we have the advantage of the dearly 
paid for experience of the European beet grower and sugar manufacturer, 
covering nearly a century, at our command there remains much to be 
done in the way of simplifying the mechanical and chemical methods in 
the factory and devising means whereby the hand labor in the fields 
may be reduced, if not entirely be done away with. 

But American inventive genius has ever been equal to any task and 
it surely will solve the problems which confront this new industry. 
Looking at the results so far obtained, we certainly have every reason 
to feel proud of the progress made, which forecasts a brilliant future. 

But above all and this is my concluding advise: Farmer and factory 
must work hand in hand. The farmer produces the sugar in the field 
and the manufacturer extracts it at the factory. Their interests are so 
closely interwoven that a false step on either part would work detri- 
mental to the interests of both. The farmer would not find it profitable 
to grow sugar beets without the factory, while the factory on the other 
hand could not exist without being furnished the necessary supply of 
beets of the right quality by the farmer. Friendly relations between 
the farmer and the factory are therefore absolutely necessary and es- 
sential to success. The farmer should study the interest of the factory, 
same as the factory should study his, for both are identical. Let this 
be the thought and purpose of those who engage in the industry on 
either side.

ducts, etc., etc.; also for mak- 
ing distilled water for the 
manufacture of ice and other 
manufacturing purposes. 

During twelve months to 
date, March i, 1901, sixteen 
" Lillie " multiple-effects 
have been sold for sugar 
solutions, aggregating in 
capacity about 3,500,000 
IT. S. gallons, concentrat- 
ed say 75 % in 24 hours. 
This includes quadruple- 
effects ranging from 200,000 
gallons to 500,000 gallons, 

and triple effects ranging from 10,000 gallons to 325,000 gallons daily capacity. 
During these twelve months eight of the ordinary vertical tube multiple- 

eflfects were replaced by "I^illie" multiple-eflPects for sugar. 

ADVANTAGES OF THE '* LILLIE." 

Mechanical circulation with film evaporation. All functions automatic. Lo.sses 
from entrainment average less than i-ioo of i %. Unquestionably the most 
economical of steam. Capable of forward and reverse working, w'hich tends to 
keep tubes clean. Far less 
trouble from incrustations ; 
tubes are never scraped. 
Capable of future enlarge- 
ment : One ' ' Lillie ' ' triple- 
effect was enlarged as much 
as 100%, and "is doing 
.splendid work," writes the 
owner. But little juice in 
process. It is quickly 
started after juice comes, 
and quickly shut down after 
juice stops. Best for quad- 
ruple and higher effects, 
and for plants of greater 
capacities.

SUCCESS. 



HUNDREDS OF US£RS TESTIFY LIKE THIS: Marriottsville, Utah, Nov. 26. 98. 

The Avery Beet Digger and Sub-Soiler we bought from you is indispensable in the successful cultivation of 
beets. Kvery beet grower should have one as the ground should be sub-soiled for beets, and they can be gotten out 
without delay and to the very best advantage with the same tool. The great advantage which this plow has, is that it 
goes below the beets and raises them up instead of cutting or breaking them off. We recommend it to be a splendid 
tool. (Write for prices.) Yours truly, h. and Matthew Dinsuale.

...THE... 

Ohio 5cct Puller 

THE BEST TOOL OUT. 

When you go to buy your Puller, remember 
that the Ohio leaves the beet in its place, stand- 
ing straight covered with the ground, but the 
tap root broken at the end, so it can be picked 
up with ease. The position of the blades will 
tell you that it is built on the right principle. 
Ask your dealer to order one.

Planet Jr. Sugar Beet Tools 



Granting that the seed is good and properly planted, beet crop 
npon nothing so much as the cultivation. The plant is a tender 
little fellow and a slow grower. Weeds grow rapidly. Hence the 
necessity of prompt, careful and thorough cultivation, for which 
nothing equals our "Planet Jr." one, two and four-row cultivators. 

There is much more about them in our new 1001 
Catalogue, which is the finest we have ever published.

The aim of cultivation is to obtain the highest sug:ar content with the best 
qualitative results. Mother beets are selected in the big laboratory at the Castle 
of Friedrichswerth by expert chemists. 

The beets are selected^ first, according to shape and foliage, then examined, 
and those polarizing the highest used for further cultivation. 

Being grown in high altitudes the seed is adapted to all kinds of soil and 
climate. 



Read the Following Testimotilal : 

Mr. ED. METER, Friedrichswcrth, Gotba. 

The undersigned takes pleasure in certifying that the sugar beets raised from your seed 
were entirely satisfactory. 

They were equal to the other well-known seeds and excelled both in quality and quantity. In 
the experiments they occupied first place.

/SOMETHING TO 
CONSIDER: 

If you arc a sug:ar beet grower. 
If yoo want to invest in a beet 
sugar factory. 

IT IS THIS: 

Sugar beot culture has reached its high- 
est development in the west. All records have 
been surpassed in tonnage per acre, saccharine 
content and purity at a point on the lines of the 
Santa Fe Railway System. 

THEN 

Write to the undersigned who will be 
glad to furnish all the information possible 
regarding the number of favorable opportuni- 
ties open to grower and investor. Records of 
exjjeriments and campaigns, and data showing 
saccharine contents of beets, tonnage per acre, 
water supply, proximity of limestone, cost of 
fuel, etc., will be gladly furnished.
