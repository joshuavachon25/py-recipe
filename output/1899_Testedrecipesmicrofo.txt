Avoid Pain 




Many women endure needless pain 
at the menstrual period. They suffer 
at this time from b° "-kache, headache, 
cramps, blue spells, irritability, lassi- 
tude and general depression. While 
some of these symptoms may be in- 
evitable many of tl ern can be avoided 
by building up your general health. 

Take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable 
Compound regularly. Take it for 
relief when you feel at your worst. 
Continue to take it during the month. 
As your general health improves you 
should have less and less pain. 



Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound has the written 
endorsement of half a million women. It is sold in two forms 
— liquid and tablet. The tablets are chocolate coated and 
just as effective as the liquid. Slip a package into your 
handbag, or keep it in your desk at the office. Take your 
medicine according to directions wherever you are. Each 
, package contains 70 tablets or 35 doses, about the same 
number as is contained in a bottle of liquid Compound.

"FOR CHANGE OP LIFE" 

"The Vegetable Compound first helped me when I was 
in a rundown condition and my blood a little impure. 
I saw it advertised in the Toronto Star and friends told 
me about it. Then I took it for Char of Life and it 
corrected irregularities. Recently I took it in dry form 
and felt the benefit after two tablets, only taking six in all 
and I have been in the best cf health since."

"IT BUILT ME UP" 

*'A farmer's wife has a lot of work to do, inside and 
out. Nine years ag-o 1 got so rundown that I could not 
even do my housework. Some days I had to be in b»^d. 
I tried everything 1 heard of but got no relief. Evei'y 
month I felt worse. A friend of mine told me about 
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegfetable Compoimd. After taking 
one bottle I could eat and sleep better so my husband got 
me two more. Then I was able to do all my work and 
help him outside. I worked out in the harvest and made 
$30 in two weeks. The Vegetable Compound certainly 
built me up. Use my letter because I am glad to pass 
the good word to women who suffer as I did."

Finkham's V«g«table Compound. Whenever I feel the 
least rundown I get a bottle. I have just finished my 
third bottle and 1 feel in excellent health. I have good 
sound nerves. I am a caretaker and, my work takes me 
out sometimes late at night. Before I took yonrjnedicine

WAITING ON TABLE 

The hostess is served 
fi'- t so that she may know 
i ;• the food is properly 
prepared and provided 
with the spoon or fork for 
serving. 

After the hostess, the 
maid may serve all women 
in the room before the 
men. Or, she may begin 
at the rig-ht of the hostei^ 
and serve around the table 
regardless of persons. 

Sei-ve the second course around the table to the left. 
Alternate in this way so that no one person is always served 
last. 

Stand at the left of a person being served and hold the 
dish in your left hand so that he can help himself easily. 

Put glasses or cups down at the right of the person with 
your right hand. 

CLEARING THE TABLE 

Remove soiled plates from the left side. Remove glass, 
cups and saucers from the right. 

Carry one dish away at a time. Never pile one dish on 
top of another. 

Do not remove silver from the dishes in which it has 
been used. 

As a general rale, remove plates and principal dishes 
first, then smaller dishes.

NOURISHMENT FOR INVALIDS 

Unless your doctor has 
put the patient on a diet 
which does not include 
fruit, she will find fresh 
fruit, stewed fruits or fruit 
juices tempting, palatable 
and easy to digest. Chilled 
orange juice, lemonade or 
grape juice is a cooling, 
delicious drink. To tempt 
the patient's appetite, put 
a cherry on the top and 
serve with a straw. 

Children who refuse milk will often drmk it through a 
straw. If they dislike the flavor, add a few drops of 

vanilla. 

ORANGE FLUFF 

Beat the white of 1 egg and 1 tsp. sugar until it forms a 
stiff froth. Pile by spoonfuls in a small glass dish. Pour 
over and around it the chilled juice of one small orange or 

Vy a large orange.

<< BEFORE AND AFTER CHILDBIRTH'' 

"My mother took Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com- 
pound for years in tablet form so I thought I would try 
it before my third baby was born. I took the liquid and 
'also used Lydia E. Pinkham's Liver Pills and always 
keep them, on hand. I am the mother of four healthy 
children. Before I took the medicine I had to rest every 
little while I felt so weak and rundown. I used to faint 
too. Now I feel lots better, my ner s are steady, I eat 
and sleep well and do my housework. I am glad to 
recommend Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compoimd

LYDIA E. PINKHAM'S 
BLOOD MEDICINE 

is a reliable general tonic, equally good 
for men and women. 1 1 takes the place 
of Grandma's sulphur and molasses in 
the Spring and is much more pleasant 
to the taste. Keep it in the medicine 
chest and give it to the whole family — 
parents and children — at any time 
through the year when they need such 
a medicine. 

HUMORS AND ERUPTIONS 

are among the most common indica- 
tions and results of a run-down condi- 
tion. Such eruptions are unpleasant, 
often embarrassing and give the face 
an unhealthy appearance. They are 
not usually especially serious or dan- 
gerous. More serious results may 
come, however, at any time from the 
accumulated impurities which they indicate. 

GOOD HOME TREATMENT 

is necc sary. Eat plain, nutritious and easily digested
