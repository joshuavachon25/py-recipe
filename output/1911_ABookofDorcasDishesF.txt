THE PRAISE AND PROPERTIES 
OF A GOOD WIFE 



"She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her 
food from afar." 

"She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat 
to her household." 

"She eonsidereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit 
of her hands she planteth a vineyard." 

"She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she 
reacheth forth her hands to the needy." 

"She looketh well to the ways of her household, and 
eateth not the bread of idleness." 

"Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her hus- 
band also, and he praiseth her." 

"Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou 
excellest them all." 

Proverbs xxxi. 



INTRODUCTION 

DO not suppose we ** Dorcases *' fancy that 
the world is waiting for another cookery 
book, nor that we believe we are supplying a 
long-felt want with this little pamphlet. One 
could have no illusions on that subject when the 
monthly and weekly magazines, and even the 
daily papers, have pages in every issue devoted 
to recipes, together with columns upon columns 
of suggestive bills of fare. Everybody reads 
these regularly, remarking to the person sitting 
near : * * That sounds good ! ' * * * I must paste 
that in my book.'* ** Let's try that some time." 
My private opinion is that we need cooks much 
more than books, and that one housekeeper who 
will experiment on appetizing novelties is worth 
a dozen of those who buy books, cut out, pin up, 
paste in, and hoard recipes, but continue to 
serve their families with the same dishes they 
used when they began housekeeping. 

This modest volume does not aim to be a com- 
plete compendium of scientific cookery nor 
a practical guide to the young housekeeper; 
neither can we claim for it any startling origi- 
nality. It has been compiled because we have 
many enterprises in hand for which we need 
money, and we believe the book may be one of 
the ways in which we can fill our treasury. But 
although we disclaim all intention of surprising 

5 



and instructing the culinary world, and avow 
our hope of financial profit, we take honest 
pride in onr little book, as we do in all onr en- 
deavors, large or small. Every dish in it has 
been made hundreds of times by the particular 
Dorcas whose name is attached to it; but I 
sometimes think Dorcas should accompany her 
own recipe and stand over it until it is cooked 
and eaten, for the cake labelled ** Delicious *^ 
sometimes turns out a sorry failure in your 
opposite neighbor's kitchen. There is a hard 
hand and a light one in cooking as well as on 
a horse's rein, and it almost seems as if butter 
and eggs knew their mistress and instinctively 
obeyed her orders, feeling themselves in the 
grasp of a superior power. 

** Oven- judgment '' never comes to some 
women in the course of their lives (and we cer- 
tainly hope that they will feel no need of it in 
another world!) nor does the faculty of deftly 
combining the necessary ingredients. The terms 
'' stiff,'' '' thin," '' hard," '' soft " are very 
flexible and depend on the cook's point of view, 
while the art of perfect seasoning and flavor- 
ing is all too seldom attained. 

Women are largely in the majority in New 
England, and because that is so it follows 
necessarily and naturally that they should take 
a considerable share of civic as well as do- 
mestic responsibility. 

In church, school, garden, and farm work 
we women are as much needed as in the home, 
and we shall never be able to make our vil- 

6 



lages pleasant and prosperous places to live in, 
nor provide the proper environment for the 
younger generation unless we apply ourselves 
earnestly and intelligently to the task. 

The cooking in small hotels and boarding 
houses along our countryside does not com- 
pare with that in England or on the Continent, 
and we are constantly criticised for the smaU 
amount of nourishment and large amount of 
dyspepsia with which we furnish our farming 
and laboring classes. 

The devising of a good liberal diet, simple 
but varied, is one of the most important ends 
to which the mistress of a household can de- 
vote her energies. Is Dorcas doing all she might 
in this matter? How can we inspire and help 
our brothers, husbands, fathers to bring back 
the old garden to its once noble estate t Where 
are the rows of currant and raspberry bushes 
we used to see at the side or back of the house ! 
We need not raise small fruits for the market 
if we lack time or strength, land or labor, but 
how about raising things for the family and 
the growing children? 

When I was a giri there were always a few 
black and red currant bushes in the garden, 
with blackberries, raspberries, or strawberries. 
There was a single pear, or crab apple, quince, 
or plum tree in the orchard, and a Concord 
grape-vine over a porch. Citron melons were 
grown then, and there was a barberry bush 
planted by the kitchen door; and what deli- 
cious preserves for the long winter came from 

7 



those quince and apple trees, those citrons and 
damsons and pomegranates! Oreen and ripe 
tomatoes helped to swell the list, and mother 
had only to buy lemons and sugar and ginger 
to fill the goody-cupboard to bursting. Home- 
made jelEes and jams mean a few days in a hot 
kitchen, but what comparison is there between 
these, with their pure, wholesome fruit juices, 
and the gelatine-laden products of the shops t 

How shall we make the table more attractive, 
the food at once more appetizing and nourish- 
ing! How, especially, can it be done when the 
mistress of the house is a mother of children, 
having, with a little help, or with none at all, to 
take care of washing, ironing, sewing, mending, 
as well as cooking! Only a woman of good 
health, rare common sense, great patience, and 
fine spirit can compass this daily round of 
duties successfully; but it is a very beautiful, 
even a splendid thing when it is compassed 1 

A palatable meal, a well-set table, a family 
with keen and appreciative appetite, good diges- 
tion, hearty, healthy children with pleasant 
table manners, and a general feeling that 
mother is the very best cook in the universe I 
These read like humble things, but their sum 
total is probably one of the greatest factors in 
useful and happy living. 

Any one who has a general helper or a servant 
can easily manage spotless table linen, changes 
of plates, service in courses, flowers, and all the 
accessories that go to make up a dainty meal; 
but how shall the tired woman who has been on 

8 



her feet all day keep strength and ambition 
enough to preserve the niceties of life when she 
is completely worn out with its necessities? It 
cannot always be done, — that might as well be 
confessed at the outset. There are days of con- 
stant interruption, of illness, of discourage- 
ment, of exhaustion, when things are dropped 
wearily on the table, and the children are al- 
lowed to eat in confusion and hurry and dis- 
order. But this is only occasional, and any 
woman who loves and seeks after beauty — 
beauty of cleanliness, freshness, order, refine- 
ment, harmony, punctuality — will manage to 
attain it at least a fair portion of the time. 
Every home in which this sort of modest unos- 
tentatious beauty is present is a lighthouse to 
the surrounding country. Every housekeeper 
who can be clean without being ' * p 'ison neat, ' ' 
energetic without being a '* bustler, '* a good 
cook without being too extravagant, hospitable, 
yet keeping strength for her own family, — such 
a woman is as much an inspiration to the com- 
munity as she is to her own household. 

Our Dorcas Society has held many unspoken 
ideals these last busy years. It has not only 
held them but it has worked for them. We want 
our little group of villages on the brink of the 
river to hold up their heads and wax strong. 
We want our district schools to improve from 
year to year; our buildings to renew their 
paint and shingles; our farms to thrive; our 
Village Improvement societies to prosper; our 
churches to grow; our roads to be bettered; 

9 



our new Library to be an influence in its 
modest way. 

We are helping to build a new Parish or 
Community House where boys ' and girls ' clubs 
can meet; where gatherings of many sorts can 
be held, and such lectures and entertainments 
as are appropriate to a small audience room; 
where also the social hospitalities of the church 
can be dispensed with comfort and dignity. 

Many of our voung people will go away in 
search of larger opportunities and gains, but 
we shall always have them during the forma- 
tive years of life, and we want to send them out 
into the world so equipped that they will be a 
credit to the place of tiieir birth. 

This Dorcas Fair of August, 1911, is one of 
our annual attempts to earn money for worthy 
causes. The Book of Dorcas Dishes will be 
a souvenir of our hopes, our ambitions, our 
courage, and pur faith. It will voice our belief 
in the value of good housekeeping and good 
cookery, which indeed are real civic virtues. 

When you try one of our simple recipes 
remember that you have added your mite to a 
fund that will be used for all sorts of fine pur- 
poses, broad and unsectarian ones. 

We have purposely included very simple 
dishes; just the plain, daily diet of a band of 
country Dorcases, with a few pretty things we 
cook when an. old friend graces the supper 
table, or company comes from Boston, or John 
brings home his bride. Let us sum it all up. 
Good cooking needs skill, judgment, and imag- 

10 



ination, therefore it tests the qualities of the 
cleverest woman. Nobody pretends that dish- 
washing is attractive, and nothing but Chris- 
tian grace makes us endure the pots and pans, 
but cookery is high art ; let us think of it as 
such, and we shall be properly proud of such 
triumphs as we achieve. Who would not 
rather make a delicious strawberry short-cake 
than play The Maiden's Prayer on the piano f 
Where is the painted table-scarf that can com- 
pare with an honest loaf of milk-white bread f 
Is a bunch of wax or paper flowers any more 
artistic than a ball of perfect butter stamped 
with a garland of daisies! No; there is genius 
in a wonderfully seasoned dish of meat or 
fish, in a toothsome sauce, or in a clever ar- 
rangement of ** left overs.'' There is real 
poetry in a shining country kitchen; poetry in 
bread and cake as light as a feather. Would 
that a little of it, felt by some Dorcas as she 
stirred and kneaded and measured, — would 
that a little of it might be imprisoned in this 
text, and find its way into another woman's 
heart in some other country kitchen.

% cup melted butter or bacon fat.

flour. Put small pieces of butter on top and 
bake in good oven 1 hour. Baste well with but- 
ter or bacon fat. Make gravy. 

22 



Pot Boast 

(Mrs. John Guilford) 

Melt in a hot frying pan a lump of butter; or 
fry out a small piece of pork; while very hot put 
in the roast, browning all sides. EoU it over; 
do not insert fork, so as to keep all juices in. 
When browned, put in a pot which has been 
heated ; put water in the frying pan to get any 
juices that have escaped, and pour over meat. 
Cover closely and cook slowly 3 hours, turning 
occasionally. Keep about a cup of water under 
the meat and sprinkle a little flour and salt over 
the meat 15 minutes before taking out, and turn 
several times. Browned potatoes are very nice 
with this meat : Boil potatoes whole until nearly 
done; drain, roll in flour, take meat out and put 
in potatoes in the gravy in the pot, until browned 
somewhat. Take the potatoes out and place in 
a hot oven while thickening the gravy and they 
will crisp over and are very nice. 

' *■ . 
Dorcas Hash

on top, and cook 6 minutes longer. 

Chicken a la Dorcas

Cut up a tender chicken. Season with salt and 
pepper, dip in egg and crumbs, and arrange the 
pieces close together in a buttered baking-pan. 
Dot each piece with butter, cover with another

quently, so that it may be thoroughly dissolved 
before putting in meat. This will keep all win- 
ter, and is not too salt for slicing and frying. 
It is also delicious boiled to eat cold. 

Pickled Beets and Carrots 

(Mrs. Frank L. Tarhov) 

Boil beets until tender; remove the skins; 
slice while hot; cover with hot spiced vinegar

6 large lemons. Cut the rhubarb in small pieces. 
Slice the lemons very thin. Put the fruit in a 
large bowl and cover with the sugar, letting it

cup ground mustard. Each day add freshly

them down. Place jars in steamer and cook 
until the top of the jar is too hot to place your 
hand upon it; remove the cover and fill with 
boiling water; see that all the air is out, and 
seal. Place jars in an earthen crock and pour 
enough boiling water in to come up around 
the neck of the glass jars and let them stand 
until cold. A pinch of salt added to each jar 
improves the flavor.

XIII 
TO A DORCAS DAUGHTER 

(Kate Douglas Wiggin) 

IF any member of the family has a few min- 
utes a day in which to gather a few flowers 
for the supper table, you are the one, whether 
you are twenty years old or whether you are 
only ten. If you are still going to school, you 
may be able to get sometMng every afternoon 
on your way home; for there is scarcely a week, 
from the time when the dandelions blow, to the 
day when the trees are bare and the ground is 
frozen, when you can not find something lovely 
by the wayside, in the fields, or in the woods. 

If you can do ** button-hole stitch, ^^ you can 
make a colored edge on a circle of linen for a 
small centre-piece. You can make a pretty 
effect also by putting three or four rows of 
feather-stitching inside the edge; or failing 
anything else, you can feather-stitch a few 
ready-made doylies with different colors and 
have one to match any nosegay. 

If you have a family garden, all is easy from 
June to October ; but if you have not, God has 
been just as good to the poor as the rich in the 
matter of flowers, ^nd the busiest country child 
has just as much within her reach as a princess 
with a conservatory. I give you here a few 
suggestions about making a little daily decora- 
tion for the table. There is not a flower you 

91 



do not know, nor one you have not often 
gathered. You would put them together your- 
self in just the same way, perhaps ; but some- 
how, when a thing is printed in black and white 
it looks like a letter written directly to you I 
You stop and think: ** Why did I never do itt 
It is easy ; it is pretty ; mother and father will 
like it.*^ You will stand up on a chair to look 
on the top shelf of the closet and find a glass 
finger bowl, or a wine glass, or a lemonade cup, 
or a spoonholder. You will see what vases there 
are in the house and what mother will allow 
you to use. As the days go on you will search 
for some new growing thing; you will invent 
and combine and scheme to get a novel effect. 
Some one in the family will notice how you 
arrange flowers and leaves and grasses, and 
you will do them more and more beautifully 
as time goes on, using long stems and putting 
them together loosely and naturally, as Mother 
Nature does. 

Then what will have happened? Only this. 
You will have developed a new love of beauty, 
for you will have learned to produce it. You 
will have used the ** thinking part** of you; you 
will have devised and combined and invented; 
in a word, you will have become an artist 1 

It is rather a nice thing to be, — a decorator 
of the farmhouse, the church, the village school I 
Perhaps they will beseech you to do something 
for the Town Hall later on. Who knows 1 **Tall 
oaks from little acorns grow. * * 

Meantime, as you are passing the parlor door 

92 



wliere your mother is talking with a visitor yon 
may hear something like this : 

** Yes, onr Emily has a great knack with 
flowers. She took a bean pot for a vase when 
she pnt that goldenrod in the fireplace, but after 
all it looks pretty on the brick hearth. . . . 
That bnnch of black-eyed Susans on the table 
is in one of my cooking bowls. Emily says this 
room is so gloomy she always wants to light it 
up with yellow, but the sitting-room is full of 
sunshine and she generally gives me something 
green in there. . . . Yes, it's a wonderful com- 
fort, now that I am too lame to get away from 
the house, to have Emily bring all outdoors in 
to me, and she is only fourteen. . . . She has 
so much ingenuity 1 Last night was her 
father's birthday. We had nothing extra for 
supper, for a long ilhiess in the house uses up 
money faster than anything else and we have 
to be economical. . . . Well, she took an old 
gold-fish globe that the doctor's wife gave her, 
and filled it with sprigs of autumn leaves and 
then she scattered the handsomest ones over 
the cloth and tied a great red bunch on her 
father's chair. As he looked in the dining- 
room door he caught sight of the table and 
guessed it was some kind of an 'occasion.' Then 
he remembered it was his own birthday, gave 
an extra brush to his hair, and put on his second- 
best coat. I was n 't going to be outdone, so I 
put a couple of purple asters on my plate of 
baking-powder biscuits and a sprig of green 
on each end of my platter of corned-beef hash. 

93 



. . . John, my oldest boy^ is about sixteen, and 
he used to make fun of his sister's way of 
* dressing up victuals, ' — that is what he called 
it; — but he never does it any more; he says 
that we all kind of * live up to ' Emily's flowers 
now-a-days. - ' 

When you have heard this, if you are a good 
Dorcas daughter, your heart will be glad. Per- 
haps in order to * * live up to " your own flowers 
you will take extra trouble in sweeping and 
dusting and arranging the furniture to the best 
advantage. Remember, mother carries the 
heaviest burden, day after day and year after 
year. You can lighten it, of course, by industry 
and helpfulness and cheerful companionship, 
but you can do it still further if you can 
aid in creating and maintaining the ** Home 
Beautiful." 



Twenty Wild Flowee Combinations fob Fabm- 
HOUSE AND Village Dining Tables 

1. A saucer of the very first dandelions, just 
as a spring surprise. 

2. A tall glass of purple ** flags" or gentians. 

3. Mayflowers or anemones, or a plate of 
partridge berries and their leaves. 

4. A few apple blossoms from some heavily 
laden tree that bears poor fruit. 

5. Field daisies; sometimes with grasses, 
sometimes with buttercups. 

94 



6. Long-stemmed purple clover in a wine 
glass. 

7. Ferns of any sort. 

8. A bowl of wild roses. 

9. ** Butter and eggs *' in a yellow vase. 

10. Vase of pink or white wild spirea. 

11. Wild clematis. Let it droop from the 
vase on to the table. 

12. A low glass dish filled with pond lilies. 

13. A bowl of tiger lilies, day lilies, or red 
lilies. One kind or another is generally to be 
found growing near some deserted house or by 
the roadside. 

14. Goldenrod and Queen Anne's lace (wild 
carrot). 

15. A glass bowl of goldenrod with little 
branches of red choke cherries. 

16. Black-eyed Susans. 

17. A low bowl of scarlet bunch berries. 

18. Pink hardback. 

19. Goldenrod and brown autumn leaves. 

20. Bed and yellow autumn leaves. 

21. A branch of bright-cheeked crab apples, 
laid flat in the centre of the table. 

22. Arrangements of flat hemlock or juniper 
branches, sometimes with the addition of little 
pine cones. This is for the holidays. For 
Christmas morning you can have a tiny tree, 12 
or 14 inches high, and decorate it as you please. 

Waeiongs 
Never use any decoration of plush or silk or 
ribbon on a plainly furnished table. Never 

95 



make jout centre bouquet tall enongh to con- 
ceal from each other the faces of the persons 
opposite. Never pack flowers tightly in a vase 
nor fill it too f nil. Never allow a faded flower 
on the table. Do not nse one vase nor one kind 
of flowers until the family is tired of the sight 
of them. Variety is the spice of life.

THE PRAISE AND PROPERTIES 
OF A GOOD WIFE 



"She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her 
food from afar." 

"She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat 
to her household.'' 

"She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit 
of her hands she planteth a vineyard." 

"She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she 
reacheth forth her hands to the needy." 

"She looketh well to the ways of her household, and 
eateth not the bread of idleness." 

"Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her hus- 
band also, and he praiseth her." 

"Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou 
excellest them all." 

PrOVEKBS XXXI* 



INTRODUCTION 

DO not suppose we ^^ Dorcases '' fancy that 
the world is waiting for another cookery 
book, nor that we believe we are supplying a 
long-felt want with this little pamphlet. One 
could have no illusions on that subject when the 
monthly and weekly magazines, and even the 
daily papers, have pages in every issue devoted 
to recipes, together with columns upon columns 
of suggestive bills of fare. Everybody reads 
these regularly, remarking to the person sitting 
near: *^ That sounds good! '' ^* I must paste 
that in my book.'* ^^ Let's try that some time.'' 
My private opinion is that we need cooks much 
more than books, and that one housekeeper who 
will experiment on appetizing novelties is worth 
a dozen of those who buy books, cut out, pin up, 
paste in, and hoard recipes, but continue to 
serve their families with the same dishes they 
used when they began housekeeping. 

This modest volume does not aim to be a com- 
plete compendium of scientific cookery nor 
a practical guide to the young housekeeper; 
neither can we claim for it any startling origi- 
nality. It has been compiled because we have 
many enterprises in hand for which we need 
money, and we believe the book may be one of 
the ways in which we can fill our treasury. But 
although we disclaim all intention of surprising 

5 



and instructing the culinary world, and avow 
our hope of financial profit, we take honest 
pride in our little book, as we do in all our en- 
deavors, large or small. Every dish in it has 
been made hundreds of times by the particular 
Dorcas whose name is attached to it; but I 
sometimes think Dorcas should accompany her 
own recipe and stand over it until it is cooked 
and eaten, for the cake labelled '^ Delicious '^ 
sometimes turns out a sorry failure in your 
opposite neighbor's kitchen. There is a hard 
hand and a light one in cooking as well as on 
a horse's rein, and it almost seems as if butter 
and eggs knew their mistress and instinctively 
obeyed her orders, feeling themselves in the 
grasp of a superior power. 

^* Oven-judgment '' never comes to some 
women in the course of their lives (and we cer- 
tainly hope that they will feel no need of it in 
another world!) nor does the faculty of deftly 
combining the necessary ingredients. The terms 
'* stiff,'' **thin," ^Miard," *^ soft " are very 
flexible and depend on the cook's point of view, 
while the art of perfect seasoning and flavor- 
ing is all too seldom attained. 

Women are largely in the majority in New 
England, and because that is so it follows 
necessarily and naturally that they should take 
a considerable share of civic as well as do- 
mestic responsibility. 

In church, school, garden, and farm work 
we women are as much needed as in the home, 
and we shall never be able to make our vil- 

6 



lages pleasant and prosperous places to live in, 
nor provide the proper environment for the 
younger generation unless we apply ourselves 
earnestly and intelligently to the task. 

The cooking in small hotels and boarding 
houses along our countryside does not com- 
pare with that in England or on the Continent, 
and we are constantly criticised for the small 
amount of nourishment and large amount of 
dyspepsia with which we furnish our farming 
and laboring classes. 

The devising of a good liberal diet, simple 
but varied, is one of the most important ends 
to which the mistress of a household can de- 
vote her energies. Is Dorcas doing all she might 
in this matter? How can we inspire and help 
our brothers, husbands, fathers to bring back 
the old garden to its once noble estate 1 Where 
are the rows of currant and raspberry bushes 
we used to see at the side or back of the house 1 
We need not raise small fruits for the market 
if we lack time or strength, land or labor, but 
how about raising things for the family and 
the growing children? 

When I was a girl there were always a few 
black and red currant bushes in the garden, 
with blackberries, raspberries, or strawberries. 
There was a single pear, or crab apple, quince, 
or plum tree in the orchard, and a Concord 
grape-vine over a porch. Citron melons were 
grown then, and there was a barberry bush 
planted by the kitchen door; and what deli- 
cious preserves for the long winter came from 

7 



those quince and apple trees, those citrons and 
damsons and pomegranates! Green and ripe 
tomatoes helped to swell the list, and mother 
had only to bny lemons and sugar and ginger 
to fill the goody-cupboard to bursting. Home- 
made jellies and jams mean a few days in a hot 
kitchen, but what comparison is there between 
these, with their pure, wholesome fruit juices, 
and the gelatine-laden products of the shops? 

How shall we make the table more attractive, 
the food at once more appetizing and nourish- 
ing? How, especially, can it be done when the 
mistress of the house is a mother of children, 
having, with a little help, or with none at all, to 
take care of washing, ironing, sewing, mending, 
as well as cooking? Only a woman of good 
health, rare common sense, great patience, and 
fine spirit can compass this daily round of 
duties successfully; but it is a very beautiful, 
even a splendid thing when it is compassed! 

A palatable meal, a well-set table, a family 
with keen and appreciative appetite, good diges- 
tion, hearty, healthy children with pleasant 
table manners, and a general feeling that 
mother is the very best cook in the universe! 
These read like humble things, but their sum 
total is probably one of the greatest factors in 
useful and happy living. 

Any one who has a general helper or a servant 
can easily manage spotless table linen, changes 
of plates, service in courses, flowers, and all the 
accessories that go to make up a dainty meal; 
but how shall the tired woman who has been on 

8 



her feet all day keep strength and ambition 
enough to preserve the niceties of life when she 
is completely worn ont with its necessities? It 
cannot always be done, — that might as well be 
confessed at the outset. There are days of con- 
stant interruption, of illness, of discourage- 
ment, of exhaustion, when things are dropped 
wearily on the table, and the children are al- 
lowed to eat in confusion and hurry and dis- 
order. But this is only occasional, and any 
woman who loves and seeks after beauty — 
beauty of cleanliness, freshness, order, refine- 
ment, harmony, punctuality — will manage to 
attain it at least a fair portion of the time. 
Every home in which this sort of modest unos- 
tentatious beauty is present is a lighthouse to 
the surrounding country. Every housekeeper 
who can be clean without being ^* p'ison neat," 
energetic without being a '^ bustler,'' a good 
cook without being too extravagant, hospitable, 
yet keeping strength for her own family, — such 
a woman is as much an inspiration to the com- 
munity as she is to her own household. 

Our Dorcas Society has held many unspoken 
ideals these last busy years. It has not only 
held them but it has worked for them. We want 
our little group of villages on the brink of the 
river to hold up their heads and wax strong. 
We want our district schools to improve from 
year to year; our buildings to renew their 
paint and shingles; our farms to thrive; our 
Village Improvement societies to prosper; our 
churches to grow; our roads to be bettered;

our new Library to be an influence in its 
modest way. 

We are helping to build a new Parish or 
Community House where boys' and girls' clubs 
can meet; where gatherings of many sorts can 
be held, and such lectures and entertainments 
as are appropriate to a small audience room; 
where also the social hospitalities of the church 
can be dispensed with comfort and dignity. 

Many of our young people will go away in 
search of larger opportunities and gains, but 
we shall always have them during the forma- 
tive years of life, and we want to send them out 
into the world so equipped that they will be a 
credit to the place of their birth. 

This Dorcas Fair of August, 1911, is one of 
our annual attempts to earn money for worthy 
causes. The Book of Dorcas Dishes will be 
a souvenir of our hopes, our ambitions, our 
courage, and our faith. It will voice our belief 
in the value of good housekeeping and good 
cookery, which indeed are real civic virtues. 

When you try one of our simple recipes 
remember that you have added your mite to a 
fund that will be used for all sorts of fine pur- 
poses, broad and unsectarian ones. 

We have purposely included very simple 
dishes; just the plain, daily diet of a band of 
country Dorcases, with a few pretty things we 
cook when an old friend graces the supper 
table, or company comes from Boston, or John 
brings home his bride. Let us sum it all up. 
Good cooking needs skill, judgment, and imag- 

10 



ination, therefore it tests the qualities of the 
cleverest woman. Nobody pretends that dish- 
washing is attractive, and nothing but Chris- 
tian grace makes us endure the pots and pans, 
but cookery is high art; let us think of it as 
such, and we shall be properly proud of such 
triumphs as we achieve. Who would not 
rather make a delicious strawberry short-cake 
than play The Maiden's Prayer on the piano? 
Where is the painted table-scarf that can com- 
pare with an honest loaf of milk-white bread? 
Is a bunch of wax or paper flowers any more 
artistic than a ball of perfect butter stamped 
with a garland of daisies? No; there is genius 
in a wonderfully seasoned dish of meat or 
fish, in a toothsome sauce, or in a clever ar- 
rangement of ^' left overs." There is real 
poetry in a shining country kitchen; poetry in 
bread and cake as light as a feather. Would 
that a little of it, felt by some Dorcas as she 
stirred and kneaded and measured, — would 
that a little of it might be imprisoned in this 
text, and find its way into another woman's 
heart in some other country kitchen.

Cover closely and cook slowly 3 hours, turning 
occasionally. Keep about a cup of water under

the meat 15 minutes before taking out, and turn 
several times. Browned potatoes are very nice

per into an agate w^are sauce pan, and bring to

Add left-over gravy to the tomatoes. Put into 
a baking dish alternate layers of macaroni and 
meat, pour in the tomatoes and gravy, cover the 
top with fine bread crumbs and bake in the oven 
until the crumbs are well browned. The propor-

then place chicken on hot platter and cover all 
with thickened gravy, unstrained.

ful baking powder, 1 small teaspoonful salt. Use 
milk to stir as stiff as possible with a strong 
spoon, leaving a little dust of flour that is not 
mixed in. Dip the spoon in the stew, then in 
dough, cutting off small pieces not larger than a 

26 



FOR WRITTEN RECEIPTS 



hen's egg, as they expand to twice their size.

XIII 
TO A DORCAS DAUGHTER 

(Kate Douglas Wiggin) 

IF any member of the family has a few min- 
utes a day in which to gather a few floweris 
for the snpper table, yon are the one, whether 
you are twenty years old or whether you are 
only ten. If you are still going to school, you 
may be able to get something every afternoon 
on your way home ; for there is scarcely a week, 
from the time when the dandelions blow, to the 
day when the trees are bare and the ground is 
frozen, when you can not find something lovely 
by the wayside, in the fields, or in the woods. 

If you can do ** button-hole stitch,'' you can 
make a colored edge on a circle of linen for a 
small centre-piece. You can make a pretty 
effect also by putting three or four rows of 
feather-stitching inside the edge; or failing 
anything else, you can feather-stitch a few 
ready-made doylies with different colors and 
have one to match any nosegay. 

If you have a family garden, all is easy from 
June to October ; but if you have not, God has 
been just as good to the poor as the rich in the 
matter of flowers, and the busiest country child 
has just as much within her reach as a princess 
with a conservatory. I give you here a few 
suggestions about making a little daily decora- 
tion for the table. There is not a flower you 

91 



do not know, nor one yon have not often 
gathered. You would put them together your- 
self in just the same way, perhaps; but some- 
how, when a thing is printed in black and white 
it looks like a letter written directly to you! 
You stop and think: '' Why did I never do it? 
It is easy ; it is pretty ; mother and father will 
like it.'^ You will stand up on a chair to look 
on the top shelf of the closet and find a glass 
finger bowl, or a wine glass, or a lemonade cup, 
or a spoonholder. You will see what vases there 
are in the house and what mother will allow 
you to use. As the days go on you will search 
for some new growing thing; you will invent 
and combine and scheme to get a novel effect. 
Some one in the family will notice how you 
arrange flowers and leaves and grasses, and 
you will do them more and more beautifully 
as time goes on, using long stems and putting 
them together loosely and naturally, as Mother 
Nature does. 

Then what will have happened? Only this. 
You will have developed a new love of beauty, 
for you will have learned to produce it. You 
will have used the *^ thinking part'' of you; you 
will have devised and combined and invented; 
in a word, you will have become an artist ! 

It is rather a nice thing to be, — a decorator 
of the farmhouse, the church, the village school ! 
Perhaps they will beseech you to do something 
for the Town Hall later on. Who knows? ''Tall 
oaks from little acorns grow. ' ' 

Meantime, as you are passing the parlor door 
92 



where your motlier is talking with a visitor you 
may hear something like this : 

^^ Yes, our Emily has a great knack with 
flowers. She took a bean pot for a vase when 
she put that goldenrod in the fireplace, but after 
all it looks pretty on the brick hearth. . . . 
That bunch of black-eyed Susans on the table 
is in one of my cooking bowls. Emily says this 
room is so gloomy she always wants to light it 
up with yellow, but the sitting-room is full of 
sunshine and she generally gives me something 
green in there. . . . Yes, it's a wonderful com- 
fort, now that I am too lame to get away from 
the house, to have Emily bring all outdoors in 
to me, and she is only fourteen. . . . She has 
so much ingenuity! Last night was her 
father's birthday. We had nothing extra for 
supper, for a long illness in the house uses up 
money faster than anything else and we have 
to be economical. . . . Well, she took an old 
gold-fish globe that the doctor's wife gave her, 
and filled it with sprigs of autumn leaves and 
then she scattered the handsomest ones over 
the cloth and tied a great red bunch on her 
father's chair. As he looked in the dining- 
room door he caught sight of the table and 
guessed it was some kind of an 'occasion.' Then 
he remembered it was his own birthday, gave 
an extra brush to his hair, and put on his second- 
best coat. I wasn't going to be outdone, so I 
put a couple of jjurple asters on my plate of 
baking-powder biscuits and a sprig of green 
on each end of my platter of corned-beef hash. 

93 



. . . John, my oldest boy, is about sixteen, and 
he used to make fun of his sister's way of 
* dressing up victuals, ' — that is what he called 
it; — but he never does it any more; he says 
that we all kind of ' live up to ' Emily's flowers 
now-a-days/' 

When you have heard this, if you are a good 
Dorcas daughter, your heart will be glad. Per- 
haps in order to ^ ' live up to " your own flowers 
you will take extra trouble in sweeping and 
dusting and arranging the furniture to the best 
advantage. Remember, mother carries the 
heaviest burden, day after day and year after 
year. You can lighten it, of course, by industry 
and helpfulness and cheerful companionship, 
but you can do it still further if you can 
aid in creating and maintaining the " Home 
Beautiful.'' 



Twenty Wild Flowek Combinations foe Fakm- 
HOUSE AND Village Dining Tables 

1. A saucer of the very first dandelions, just 
as a spring surprise. 

2. A tall glass of purple ^'flags'' or gentians. 

3. Mayflowers or anemones, or a plate of 
partridge berries and their leaves. 

4. A few apple blossoms from some heavily 
laden tree that bears poor fruit. 

5. Field daisies; sometimes with grasses, 
sometimes with buttercups. 

94 



6. Long-stemmed purple clover in a wine 
glass. 

7. Ferns of any sort. 

8. A bowl of wild roses. 

9. ^* Butter and eggs '^ in a yellow vase. 

10. Vase of pink or white wild spirea. 

11. Wild clematis. Let it droop from the 
vase on to the table. 

12. A low glass dish filled with pond lilies. 

13. A bowl of tiger lilies, day lilies, or red 
lilies. One kind or another is generally to be 
found growing near some deserted house or by 
the roadside. 

14. Goldenrod and Queen Anne's lace (wild 
carrot). 

15. A glass bowl of goldenrod with little 
branches of red choke cherries. 

16. Black-eyed Susans. 

17. A low bowl of scarlet bunch berries. 

18. Pink hardback. 

19. Goldenrod and brown autumn leaves. 

20. Red and yellow autumn leaves. 

21. A branch of bright-cheeked crab apples, 
laid flat in the centre of the table. 

22. Arrangements of flat hemlock or juniper 
branches, sometimes with the addition of little 
pine cones. This is for the holidays. For 
Christmas morning you can have a tiny tree, 12 
or 14 inches high, and decorate it as you please. 

Waknings 
Never use any decoration of plush or silk or 
ribbon on a plainly furnished table. Never 

95 



make your centre bouquet tall enough to con- 
ceal from each other the faces of the persons 
opposite. Never pack flowers tightly in a vase 
nor fill it too full. Never allow a faded flower 
on the table. Do not use one vase nor one kind 
of flowers until the family is tired of the sight 
of them. Variety is the spice of life.
