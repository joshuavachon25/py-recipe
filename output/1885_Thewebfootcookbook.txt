SOUPS. 



General Direct ions. 

To many housekeepers the making of soups 
m.iiy not appear to need any particular care, but 
to those who are desirous of succeeding in pre- 
paring attractive dinners and excelling in delicate 
cookery, it may be well to banish the idea that 
soup is simply the water from boiled meat. 

To have good soup, the selection and prepara- 
tion of your bone and meat is of great import- 
ance. If your bone be a large one, see that your 
butcher cut it into certainly three pieces and crack 
the bone lengthwise. Boil these bones from eight 
to ten hours. Remove all grease and scum; strain 
and pour into a stone jar and keep in a cool j^lace. 
You have now the "clear stock" from which many 
varieties may be prepared. In almost any family 
the soup -kettle may be kept filled at a trifling 
cost, and the best of soups ready each day for the 
family dinner. In purchasing a roast have your 
])utcher save the trimmings, which may be boiled 
and added to your clear stock. The remains of 
any cold roast may be utilized in the same manner. 
In making different varieties each day, take a suf- 
ficient (piantity of your stock and add to it such 
accompaniments as the recipe may call for. We 
append several:

Beef. 

Take of your clear stock a sufficient quantity 
for your dinner, and season to taste; add to it, 
when boiling, a little grated carrot, maccaroni, 
and for about two quarts, one-lialf a wine glass- 
ful of l)randy. Just before serving place in your 
tureen two smoothly mashed hard-boiled eggs 
and pour upon them your soup. 

Mus. Edwakds. 

Vegetable. 

To about two quarts of stock add one small po- 
tato cut in thin slices, one onion sliced, one -half 
cup of tomatoes, one carrot sliced, a small cupful 
of finely cut celery or teaspoonful of celery seed. 
Season and serve. 

A$iiparag'ii!st. 

Soup stock, three pints; as])aragus, one can; cut 
off tough part and ])oil it half an hour in the 
soiq^; strain and set back on the stove, then add 
butter the size of an egg and two tablespoonsful 
of flour well mixed, add the tender part of the as-

up an egg and stir it in with the flour. This soup 
may be made without the onions and mace.

FISH. 

Cweiieral Directioiit^. 

Fish should he carefully washed and allowed 
to lay well sprinkled with salt a few hours before 
cooking. For frying, one-third butter to two- 
thirds lard will l)e found preferal)]e to either 
alone. Fish, to be fried, should be dredged either 
with flour, Indian meal or a mixture of flour and 
cracker crumbs. If the latter, use two -thirds 
crumbs to one -third flour. Fish to be boiled must 
be sewed tightly in a cloth, that it may keep its 
shape; the water must l)e bolliiig before putting 
the fish in ; salt the water more than for other 
meats. To freshen salt fish, always put the fish 
in with the skin uppernn^st. Milk, or milk and 
water, is preferable to water alone for freshening. 
All fish should be used as soon as possible after 
they are caught. Tom Cod should be scaled and 
cleaned. Smelt should be washed and wiped off 
with a piece of coarse mnslin ; cut a slit near the 
gills and you can easily draw out all that is ob- 
jectionable. Many persons do not draw them at 
all. Have your lard very hot, dip the fish in meal 
and flour mixed, add pepper and salt; fry until 
brown.

Shaker Style. 

Pull the fish in bits (not too small), and 
place into warm water until soft. The water 
must not boil, as l)oiling hardens the fish. Boil

until the whites are hard and cut in slices. Mix all 
slightly with thickened cream or milk ; season ^vitli 
l)utter and pepper. H, D. Sanborn. 

Crab!*. 

Crabs, as soon as caught, should be washed to 
get lid of the sand, and thrown into boiling hot

until a bright red color. Lay on a tal)le or shelf 
to cool. Take as many as you wish to use, loosen 
the shells, so as to drain off the yellow liquid, 
then carefully remove all the fat to a l^owl, with 
the white meat from the cla^vs and body, and the 
eggs, if female crabs.

two t'gg'^i 'ii^<^ stir all together, baking in the 
shells which have been carefully cleaned, or pour 
into a pudding dish. As stoves at the seaside are 
usually small, fifteen minutes with a good steady 
fire is long enough for the shells to bake, thirty 
or thirty-five minutes for the pudding dish. 
Some like, added to the alcove mixture, a table- 
spoonful of tomato catsup, or one-third of a tea-

( Original.) 

Take t^vo l)()xes of Cox's gelatine, soak each 
separately in as little water as p()ssi})le, and let 
remain over night, if possible. Take one l)Ox of 
the gelatine and add to it one pint of strong 
lemonade. Have your tinner make you a tin 
mould nine inches long l^y five inches wide, 
holding about t\vo (piarts. Pour into this 
mould lemon jelly a])Out an inch thick and 
set on ice. When cold take one cupful of 
stra^vl)erry juice and add about two tablespoons- 
ful of the gelatine. Sweeten, and cook a moment. 
Strain into mould about the same quantity as of 
the lemon. Set away to cool. Make the next 
layer of whipped cream, and add about two table- 
spoonsful of the gelatine to a cupful, and so on 
until your mould is full, taking care to keep your 
lemon jelly warm and cooling each layer before 
tke second is put in. Great ingenuity can be ex- 
ercised in ][)reparing this dessert or supper dish. 
Blackberry juice Avill make a l)lack layer, choco-

used. Small whole fruits may be put in a layer. 
Different colored ^vines may be used instead of 
fruit juice and h^mon jell. Al)()ut two table- 
s})o()nsful of gelatine must be allowed to each 
layer. If you have a cutter of any design, a little 
of each layer may be put in a saucer, and when 
mould is turned out a fancy design may be cut 
and laid over the top. Mes. Edwaeds.

then spread over the dough one-quarter of a 
pound of l)utter in lumps; sprinkle flour upon it, 
brush over with the egg to make it flaky, fold 
over the crust from each side, roll it out and do 
the same thing with the other one-quarter pound 
of ])utter. Roll out thin, cover your pie tins, and 
place in a hot oven. This crust is good for rich 
pies, patties or tarts. If preferred, use one-quar- 
ter of a pound of sweet lard to l)egin with, instead 
of the l^utter. One-cpiarter of a pound of lard 
and one -half pound of butter made into pie -crust 
according to the above directions, is rich enough 
for ordinary pies. 



CAKE. 



General Dii*ectioii!>i. 

Have all the ingredients prepared, the tins pa- 
pei-ed and buttered before mixing. Beat Initter 
and sugar to a cream. Powdered sugar or soft 
A, are considered preferable to granulated. Sift 
the cream-tartar or baking-powder in the flour 
and add last of all. The less you stir your cake 
after the tlour is in, the l)etter it will be. If soda 
is used, add it to the milk. Always beat yolks 
and whites of eggs separately, adding the yolks to 
the sugar and butter creamed, and the whites with 
the flour. Add the milk to sugar, butter and 
eggs. Always stir cake the same way. If fruit 
is used, dredge it with flour and add the last 
thing. Cake to be light should be baked slowly 
at first until thoroughly heated. Eggs should be 
placed in cold water awhile before breaking, or 
add a pinch of salt. If molasses is used, New 
Orleans is better than any other kind. To test 
cake to see if done, it is recommended to thrust a 
cold knife in quickly; if done, the knife will be 
clear from any particles when withdrawn. 

Note.- -The alcove directions are condensed from 
directions furnished by Mrs. Swinton and Miss 
Kate Holman.

blanched almonds. Beat the yolks very light, 
mix with sugar and warm water, beat hard Ave 
minutes, ^vhip the whites stiff and add alternately 
with flour to the eggs and sugar. Bake in jelly 
tins. As fast as a cake is done have some one 
stick it full of almonds and cover with icing. If 
the cakes are allowed to cool the almonds will 
break them into pieces. For the icing use the 
whites of six eggs and one and a quarter pounds 
best powdered sugar. Confectioners' sugar makes 
the most delicious icing. It is best to prepare the 
almonds the day before you wish to make the 
cake, and if you can make the icing while another 
makes the cake, the cake will be the better for it.

Liiglit Bread, I\o. 3. 

Very Good. 

Peel three good-sized potatoes, and boil until 
very soft in enough water to cover them. Strain 
the water and potatoes through a colandar, add- 
ing a little more hot water to take the potato 
through. Pour hot over the flour, adding a very 
small hit of shortening, salt and a little sugar. 
Add warm water until the sponge is soft enough 
to run. Let the sponge stand from noon until 
ahout four o'clock, then add the yeast and let it 
stand until eight or nine o'clock. Work over, 
kneading hard and working in the ilour well. 
Let it stand until morning. Make into loaves, 
and set to rise until light enough to hake. Half 
cup compressed yeast dissolved in lukewarm 
water will make three or four loaves.

half a pound of sugar. Pears only require a 
quarter of a pound of sugar. All the firm fruit 
should be cooked about half an hour. 

Miss F. A. HOLMAN. 

Jam. 

In making jam, mash some of the fruit first, so 
"as to get a little juice. Stir and mash with a 
wooden or graniteware spoon for nearly half an 
hour. Then add the sugar, three-quarters of a 
pound to one pound of fruit, and cook for twenty 
minutes. Many cover with brandied paper before 
tying a cloth on. Jam and preserves keep very 
w^ell simply with a cloth tied on tightly. If the 
fruit is very dry put in a half teacup of water at 
first. Miss F. A. Holman. 

Almond Pi*iiiiei!$. 

Italian prunes; pit them; blanch almonds and 
stuff the prunes with them; pin the prunes to- 
gether with sticks of cinnamon. Make a syrup. 
To every seven pounds of fruit add four pounds 
of sugar and one pint of vinegar. Add cloves and

cinnamon to taste. Cook the syrup iirst, then 
drop in the prunes, until cooked through. Take 
out very carefully, so as not to l>reak them. Put 
in jars; cover with hot syrup. Seal tightly. 

Mrs. H. D. Gkeein.

weigh before lioiling. To every tAvelve oranges 
allow one pint of water for the syrup. Carefully 
wipe them (^shen very much covered with black 
specks scrub with a l)rush). Boil them slowly in 
as much water as will float them, until easily pen- 
etrated with a straw. Drain them, taking off the 
rinds carefully in (piarter pieces if you can, slic- 
ing these pieces in very narrow strips. Squeeze 
the pulps and juice of the peeled oranges through 
a colander that none of the pits go through. 
After the syrup is boiled to look clear like oil (it 
takes about fifteen minutes for it to be clear), })ut 
in juice, pulp and rinds, and boil slowly one 
hour. Then put into small jar and keep in a dry 
closet. 

Pre!sierve<l Cwrapes. 

For eveiy pound of fruit allow one pound of 
sugar. Pulp your fruit, l)oil the pulps and strain

utes. Put in glasses and cover. 

Apple mariiialade. 

Peel and core two pounds sul)-acid apples and 
put in enameled sauce-pan ^vith one pint of sweet 
cider or half a pint of pure wine; add one pound 
of white sugar and cook gently three hours or 
until fruit is very soft. Pass it through a colan- 
der and then a sieve. Put in jars making air 
tight. Mks. Wm. Reid. 

Cancliecl Orange Peel. 

Cut the peel in any shape desired. Soak in

plenty of cold water for two days. Put in fresh, 
cold water on stove and boil until you can easily 
stick a straw tlirougli it. Pour off water, add 
four cups of sugar to the peel of every twelve 
oranges; add enough water o/zZ^y to dissolve sugar. 
Boil the peel in this until all moisture is evapor- 
ated. Take the skins and spread on tins in the 
oven and sprinkle powdered sugar over them. 
Mrs. O. Gerkish, Port Townsend. 

Fig Preserves. 

Pare the figs carefully, so as not to lu'eak them 
and yet remove all the skin. Weigh them, and 
allo^v for each pound of fruit three quarters of a 
pound of sugar. Put your fruit in preserving 
kettle and cover with sugar, allowing to stand 
over night. In the morning put on the fire and 
cook gently until the fruit is clear. The time is 
always uncertain. Slice lemons and boil with 
your figs. Use, according to taste, six or less. 
Ginger root may l)e used, if liked, instead of lem- 
ons. White figs are to l)e ^)referred, though many 
think it makes no difference. If the directions 
are followed the figs should keep their shape. 
Put in jelly tundders and cover.

Jellies and Ice Creams. 



<ireiieral Directions. 

Ill making jelly use either a porcelain lined 
kettle or granite warepan; the sugar should ])e put 
in a clean, dry dripping pan in the oven, and allow- 
ed to get hot enough to make a hissing sound as it 
goes into the hot juice. Stir with a granite ware 
or wooden spoon. To make very clear jelly, pour 
the juice into a thick hag and let it drain an hour 
or more without squeezing, then squeeze out the 
remainder of the juice for a second-class jelly. 
Skim off any scum that may arise. 

Crab-Apple 

Or (luinve Jelly. 
These should l)e cut up with the skins and 
cores, with barely enough water to cover them. 
Boil until soft. Put in a bag and drain off all 
the juice that will run out easily without squeez- 
ing ; three quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound 
of juice. Both quince and crab-apple jelly will 
l)e a very light color if only l)oiled hfteeii or 
t^venty minutes. If a deep red color is desired, 
boil double the time. The flavor of quince jelly 
will be more delicate if one-third or one fourth of 
apple juice l)e used. You may either press out 
the rest of the juice for a second-class jelly or

run it all through a fine sieve as for niarmalacle ; add 
three -quarters or a pound of sugar if you like, 
for eveiy pound of fruit. Boil slowly and stir 
often. It should cook for an hour or more. 

Quince Cheese. 

Quince cheese is marmalade boiled for two or 
three hours; or so that, when cold it may be 
sliced out and laid on a plate. It is very nice 
for lunch. 

« Water Ice. 

Boil together one pint of ^vater and a])0iit one 
pint of sugar. When boiling drop in a few 
pieces of orange or lemon peel ; allow to stay in a 
few minutes. When nearly cool put in orange or 
lemon juice to suit taste and freeze. 

Mes. H. W. Corbett.

sugar. Beat the first cup of sugar, flour and eggs 
together and stir into boiling milk. Cook twenty 
minutes, 'Sfirrim/. AVlien cold add second cu}) of 
sugar, cream and vanilla. Freeze. 

Ice Cream. 

One quart of cream. Make a custard of one 
pint of milk, three eggs, one tablespoonful of 
gelatine, sugar and flavoring to taste. Whip the 
cream. When the custard is cold, mix all to- 
gether and freeze. Mrs. Dr. Hexry Jones. 

Pine-apple Jelly. 

Soak one l)ox of gelatine one hour in a pint of 
cold ^vater; then add three pints of l)oiling ^vater, 
add the juice of three lemons and the grated rind 
of one lemon, one])ound and a half of loaf sugar, 
and half a pint of T)randy. Strain. When the 
jelly is about half set, mix through one pint of 
grated pine-apple which has been boiled in enough 
sugar to make very sweet. If the fruit is fresh, 
cook in sugar until clear. When the jelly is cold, 
cut into squares and serve. 

Mrs. Col. J. H. Kelly. 

Wine Jelly.

Port IViiie Jelly. 

One ounce of gelatine dissolved in a very little 
warm water. Wlien entirely dissolved, add one 
pint of port wine, two ounces of sugar, a lump of 
gum aral)ic size of a walnut, a little grated nut- 
meg. Boil for ten minutes. Strain into mould 
or jelly tumblers. Mks. Swinton. 

Currant Jelly. 

Take freslily picked but not over ri])e small, 
red currants. Remove sticks, etc., Init do not 
wash them. Set in warm oven until they shrink. 
Strain through strong cloth or jelly-bag. Set 
the jnice on the tire in ])orcelain kettle; let it come 
to a boil and skim. Add one pound of sugar to 
each pint of juice. Let it boil up once and then 
strain and skim. Let cool before putting into 
moulds. Do not use tins or iron pans or spoons, 
in preparing this. 

Mrs. C, Rochester, N. Y. 

Leiiioii Jelly. 

Two ounces Cooper''s gelatine, one and a half 
pounds of sugar, juice of five lemons. Soak gel- 
atine over night in one pint of cold water; add 
to this in the morning three pints of boiling 
water, stir until all is dissolved. Wine jelly can 
be made in same way, using one pint of wine in- 
stead of cold water. 

Miss Carrie Hopkins, Seattle. 

Orange Jelly. 

One package of gelatine, one pint of orange 



188 WEB-FOOT COOK BOOK. 

juice, juice of one lemon, sugar to taste, one and 
a half pints of boiling water, half a pint of 
cold water. Soak gelatine in the cold water and 
add orange and lemon juice, also sugar. Add 
l)oiling ^vater and let stand on stove for fifteen 
minutes. Do not hoil. Strain and mould. A 
pretty way to serve this jelly is to color half 
with cochineal syrup. Put a layer of jelly in 
your mould, when hardened put in a row of 
oranges sliced round, then a layer of red jelly. 
Keep jelly warm on stove until all is used, and 
as you put in a layer place immediately on the 
ice that it may harden quickly. Any fruit may 
])e jellied in the mould. Royal Ann cherries 
look beautifully. This jelly can also be moulded 
in the orange skins. When you use the juice cut 
a small hole in top of orange and take out all the 
pulp carefully. When your jelly is ready pour 
in the top and put on the ice. When cold cut 
the orange peel carefully away, lay on orange 
leaves (which can be procured of any florist) and 
serve. These are very easily j^repared. 

Bisque Ice Cream. 

Make a light custard of the proportion of four 
yolks to one quart of good rich milk. S^veeten 
to taste. While boiling hot put in half a pound 
of macaroons. When cool season w^ith vanilla 
and just a little almond. Beat lightly about one 
quart of cream and stir in just })efore freezing.

egar, two -thirds of a cup of water, butter the size 
of a walnut. Stir all the ingredients well to- 
gether before placing upon the stt)ve. If stirred

cents' worth of peanuts shelled and remove the 
skins. Cut each nut into two or three pieces. 
When the candy is brittle add the nuts and two 
teaspoonsful vanilla or lemon. Stir well and turn 
into greased pan. This candy requires no pull- 
ing. The above recipe may be used for almonds.

half teaspooiiful cream tartar. Boil until it spins 
a thread — that is, a drop falling from spoon will 
leave a tine thread l^ehind it; or, placing thumb 
and forefinger together, you can pull a slender 
thread from a drop of the syrup. Flavor, and set 
your dish in a pan of ice-cold water and stir con- 
stantly until it is creamed, and add part of a well 
beaten white of an egg, sufficient to make of a 
consistency suitable for your purpose. You have 
now the foundation of several different varieties. 
If chocolate -creams are desired make into balls, 
slightly flatten one end, and let cool; when cool 
dip in a saucer of chocolate, prepai-ed by placing 
a half cake in a hot oven; glaze your drops with 
white of an egg. If walnut-creams are to be made 
take your meats and place each side of a little of 
the cream and roll in granulated sugar. Cocoanut 
candy can l)e prepared by stirring in your beaten 
white of an egg and a package of cocoanut just 
as it creams. For % candy have ready a cup and 
a half of chopped tigs, and use instead of cocoa- 
nut. For fruit candy use two cups (mixed) of 
seeded and chopped raisins, English currants, 
citron and chopped almonds. These last three 
kinds of candies should be turned into shallow 
tins and marked into l^xrs, so that when cold they 
can easily be separated. Almond-drops are easily 
prepared hy covering a meat with the cream and 
rolling with granulated sugar.

CAMPING. 



Camp Recipes. 

Where the only culinary utensils carried are a 
frying pan and a small l)ucket or kettle. 

Bread. 

This can be mixed in the top of the flour sack. 
If self-rising flour is used, mix a pinch or two of 
salt in a portion of the flour in the top of the 
sack, then pouring in a little water at a time, and 
mixing it with the flour. The dough can be made 
in any desired amount Avithout ^vetting the side of 
the bag. Mix just stiff enough to handle and 
mould with hands into the proper shape. When 
ordinary flour is used, mix in yeast powder with 
the salt at the rate of alxnit three teaspoonsful to 
a quart of flour. 

Iflethocl of €ookiii$^. 

The most common way is to make the dough 
about the size of the frying-pan and one-half inch 
thick. Then grease the pan and put in the dough. 
Cook it rapidly over the fire, turning it frequently 
until it is stiff enough to stand on edge. Then 
place the loaf on edge against a stick, facing the 
fire, and close enough to cook slowly, turning fre- 
quently until ^vell done. Another way is to make

Tea. 

Nessmuck says that when camping out in the 
mountains he prefers tea to coffee. There is noth- 
ing so restful and refreshing as strong green tea. 
Bring the water to a boil and let it boil a full 
minute. Set it off and it will stop boiling. Put 
in a handful tea and it will instantly boil up 
again. Set it near the tire to simmer a few min- 
utes, and it will be ready for use. Buy the best 
green tea and use it freely on a hard tramp. 

Coffee. 

Put a heaping handful of ground coffee into 
the the pail or kettle with about four tin cupsful 
of cold water. Let it come to a boil, then take it 
from the fire and set it where it will not be dis- 
turbed, then add half cupful of cold water to set- 
tle it, and in five minutes it will be ready for use ; 
or put the coffee into hot water, letting it l^oil 
from five to twenty minutes, until strong and 
bitter enough to suit your taste, then settle as 
above. T. N. Strong. 

Fried Pilot-Bread, or Hardtack. 

Soak the hardtack in water until soft, then 
sprinkle over it a little salt and, if you have but- 
ter, fry it in plenty of butter in the fryiug pan. 
If you have no butter animal fats will do as well. 
Have plenty of grease, and have it very hot when 
you put in the hardtack. Cook rapidly.

CAMPING. 203 

To Roa^l Potatoe!^ in Camp. 

Scoop out a basin -like depression under the 
forest ick three or four inclies deep and large 
enough to hold potatoes side by side. Fill it 
with bright hardwood coals and keep a strong 
heat for half an hour or more. Next, clean out 
the hollo^v place, put the potatoes in it and cover 
with hot sand or ashes, topped with a heap of 
glowing coals, and keep as hot as you like. When 
a hardwood sliver will go through them they are 
done and should be raked out at once and eaten 
right away, Nessmuck, 

Roast Diicki^. 

This style, while given for cooking canvasbacks, 
will apply equally well for mallards or sprig - 
tails, whenever they are fat : Pluck your ducks 
clean and singe them. Remove the entrails, and 
put a raw onion or handful of chopped celery 
seed inside each duck, and roast them in a hot 
oven (use a reflector if in camp) just seventeen 
minutes, so that they will l)e nicely browned and 
yet so that the Idood follows the knife. At ten 
minutes after the ducks are put in oven to roast 
add a wineglass of port ^vine, a tal^lespoonful of 
currant jelly, the peel of a lemon or two limes, a 
saltspoonful of cayenne, two saltspoonsful of salt, 
and stir all briskly together, serving separate for 
the ducks. No one that appreciates a dinner of 
fat wild ducks will ever spoil them by stuffing 
them with stale bread or anything else.

To Cook BirdiM or ¥\^\\ 

When Ocmiping. 

Wrap them in several thicknesses of paper and 
soak with water. Green grass can be used in- 
stead of paper. Bury the package in the ashes 
under the camp fire for twenty or thirty minutes, 
as occasion may require. If a " dry camp " is 
struck, cooking without dressing does not injure 
the flavor of either birds or fish. Birds may be 
cut in pices and placed alternately with bits of 
bacon on a skewer stuck in the ground l)efore the 
camp fire. The skewer is usually made from a 
twig. Any piece of wood without pitch may be 
used. H. D. Sanborn. 

Heat. 

Put on a little salt and fry in a frying pan, or 
take a piece of meat, if from large game, and run 
a sharp -pointed stick through it, putting a piece 
of bacon or the fat of the animal on top so that it 



CAMPING. 205 

will drip over tlie rest, tlieu salt and season to 
taste, than pnt the stick in the ground in frcmt of 
the fire, turning it occasionally until the meat is 
done. If a bird, first pick and clean it (using as 
little water as possible), then split it in two from 
the fi'ont to the back so that it will lay wide oj)en, 
then season to taste and put on the stick with a 
slice of bacon on top and cook as al)OYe. Any 
small game can l)e cooked this way. 

T. N. Steong. 

To Jerk the Ifleat of Ijar§^e Craiiie. 

Prepare a platform of small sticks placed a]:)out 
four inches apart and about two or three feet 
above the ground. Use green wood for the cor- 
ner posts and for the cross sticks, as dry wood 
will be apt to take fire. The platform may be 
three or four feet wide and five or six feet long. 
Then cut your meat into strips about six inches 
long, an inch thick, and from one to three inches 
wide. Then salt and hang over the cross sticks 
of your platform. Make a slow fire of coals un- 
der the full extent of your platform, and put bark 
or stones about the edges so that the heat and 
smoke will go directly upwards through the meat. 
Keep this fire up for twelve hours, watching it 
carefully so that the meat will not be burned. 
The meat will then be sufficiently dried to be 
packed. T. N. Strong. 

Coup Bouillon of* Trout. 

Any man who can keep a frying-pan clean and 
maintain a moderate fire, can fiy trout without 



206 WEB-FOOT COOK BOOK. 

buruiug them. No trout over eight inches in 
length, shouhl ever Ije fried, but any trout be- 
tween eight and fourteen inches shouhl be split 
down the back and either bi'oiled or shingled. 
All over fourteen inches should be made into co?/j? 
bouillon^ the favorite dish of the planters in Bay- 
ou-Teche, La. Take for a dinner of eight persons, 
two fat trout and split them. Kemove the entrails 
and Avash them in cold water, drying them with 
a towel. Koll them in powdered crackers or In- 
dian meal mixed with a little salt. Cut some thin 
strips of bacon and lay them in the jDan to fry be- 
fore laying in the trout. AVhen the bacon is fried 
to a crisp, take them out and lay in the trout, and 
place the strips on top of them. Slice up two 
onions and one lime, and let them cook in the 
gravy. If you have no limes nor lemons, use 
pickled onions (without wliich no camp is com- 
plete), instead of fresh ones. After the fish have 
baked ten minutes, add one glass of Zinfandel or 
Resing wine, one glass of strained coffee, one red 
Chili pepper, or a saltspoon of cayenne, one tea- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce and a handful 
of raisins. The coiq} bouillon should be thoroughly 
cooked at the end of thirty-five minutes. If you 
are camped at the seaside and have no trout, you 
can use large flounders which are a very acceptable 
substitute. Fresh butter may be substituted for 
bacon if you so desire. T. B. Meiiey. 

Shingled Trout. 

As nearly all good trout streams are in densely 
timbered regions, let me suggest a dish of large 



CAMPING. 207 

trout wliicli originated on tlie AVilson River at 
Tillamook. Your camp plates sliould be granite 
ironware with small handles, such as are used for 
shirred effS:^. Into one of these dishes cut a ])o- 
tato, either into thin slices or small dice, sprink- 
ling them with a little salt and pepper. Whittle 
the thin end of a shingle down to a width of two 
inches, and bore a hole three -cpiarters of an inch 
wide in the thick end, into which insert a switch 
about three feet long. Split your trout down the 
back and salt it, tacking the gills to the upper 
end of the shingle and setting the sharp end into 
the dish of potatoes at the edge of a hot bed of 
hardwood coals. Butter your hsli at the gills four 
or five times while cooking, and turn the fish over 
on the shingle to enable it to cook on both sides. 
Less than twenty minutes will cook your fish if 
your fire is hot ; and if your potatoes have begun 
to fiy before the shingle is inserted in the dish, 
all will be cooked together. This dish requires 
no gravy, and the man who proposes it should be 
sent to Coventry, nem con. T. B. Merry. 

Trout and Niiiall Fi§h. 

These may be cooked in the ashes, the same as 
the birds, or they may be cooked in the frying- 
pan. On account of their fragility when cooked, 
they cannot be very well cooked on a stick, but 
can be on a piece of clean bark inclined towards 
the fire, the fish ])eing kept in position l)y pins of 
wood stuck through it into the bark.

For Bird!!«. 

Take the l)irds withoutdrawing or picking, wet 

the feathers thoroughly, then roll in the ashes 

until a crust of ashes is formed, then hollow out 

a place in the hot ashes near the fire and lay the 

bird in the hollow, carefully covering it with hot 

ashes; then rake liot coals over all. When done, 

take the bird out carefully and shake off the 

ashes and carefully take off the feathers and skin. 

These will come off very easily. Then remove 

the entrails, which will be found all dried up and 

gathered into a round ball. Then season to taste 

and the bird is ready for the table.

heat. Lay thin strips of pork along the upper

THE SICK ROOM. 



Oeneral Directions. 

BY G. C. LANE, M. D. 

It is clearly impossible, within tlie limits of a 
work like this, to discuss this subject exhaust- 
ively. A few general rules on the subject is all 
that will be attempted. • A sick room should be 
large, so situated that an abundance of light can 
be admitted when required, and above all well 
ventilated. It is not sufficient that one or even 
more windows on the same side of the room 
should be ke2:)t constantly raised or j^ulled down ; 
for, while this allows fresh air to enter, it pro- 
vides no means of exit for the vitiated air of the 
room. A cnrreiU of air is imperative in order to 
properly ventilate a room. It is, of course, to be 
understood that the bed of the patient should be 
so placed as to be out of the draught so caused. 
In cold weather sufficient fire should be main- 
tained in the room (preferal)ly in an open fire- 
place) to keep the room at the proper tempera- 
ture when ventilated as above. The fear of the 
bugbear "catching cold" has l)een the death of 
many a person. In many febrile diseases it is im- 
possible to reduce the temperature of the patient 
sufficiently to cause the smallest risk of such a 
thing. 



210 WEB-FOOT COOK BOOK. 

Tlie same is true of l)atlnng. It should ])e 
iuipressed ou tlie uiiuds of those haviug the care 
of the sick that daily ablutions are none the less 
useful iu sicknesg! than in health, and in such dis- 
eases as typhoid fever, scarlet fever, etc., cold 
baths are indispensable. The sooner the world 
gets over its prejudice against this procedure in 
such cases, the better it will l)e for mankind. 

.A sick-room should l)e kept (piiet, but not too 
dark at all times. The sunlight is not only cheer- 
ful, but healthful, and should l)e admitted when 
the eyes of the patients will bear it, or when they 
are asleep. 

As a rule, only the nurse and immediate rela- 
tions of the sick should be admitted into the 
room, and it should never be crowded. Much 
harm is sometimes done by thoughtless per- 
sons being admitted into the sick-room of weak 
and nervous persons, and allowed to exhaust or 
excite them by their gossip. 

All subjects likely to excite the sick one should 
be avoided. A cheerful demeanor should be 
assumed by all \\\\o frequent the sick-room. 
Nothing does more to enable patients to l)attle 
successfully \vith the grim monster than the smil- 
ing, hopeful face of those they love. It is gener- 
ally best to employ skilled, professional nurses for 
all severe cases, or those likely to be prolonged. 

AVhile it is true that the tender ministerings of 
a brother or sister are very grateful to a sick per- 
son, and the gentle touch of a mother's hand 
sooths a fevered brow as nothing else can, yet the 



THE SICK ROOM. 211 

natural dread of giving pain to one near and dear 
to tliem often leads to the neglect of important 
duties, thus rendering such persons unfit for 
nurses. 

In many cases, and especially those character- 
ized by free perspiration, the linens of the bed 
and of the patient should be changed daily. 

Disinfectants. 

It should never be forgotten that fresh air is 
the best disinfectant. Few cases will require the 
use of chemical disinfectants if the rules of ven- 
tilation given above are faithfully observed. 

For use within the sick room Labarrague's 
solution of chlorinated soda (to be had at drug 
stores) is probably the best, though carbolic acid, 
permanganate of potash, chlorine water, etc., may 
be used. 

The linens of the bed and pei'son of scarlet 
fever patients should be disinfected before being 
taken out of the sick room. For this purpose 
thev should be soaked in the followino; solution, 
viz: Eight ounces of sulphate of zinc, an ounce 
of pure carbolic acid, and three gallons of water. 
A piece of muslin soaked in the same solution 
may also be suspended in the room. If the linens 
of tyi^hoid fever and cholera patients become 
niucli soiled they had best be T)urned. 

Dietary. 

As a rule too little is kno^v^l about how to pre- 
pare suitalde food for the sick. As an instance, 
the " beef tea " usually made is little more than 



212 WEB-FOOT COOK BOOK. 

water flavored with beef. A patient's clioice 
should be consulted, as far as possili)le, when in a 
condition to feel and express a desire for a par- 
ticular kind of food. Different articles should be 
given alternatively, lest one kind of food pall on 
the taste and become positively obnoxious to the 
patient by constant repetition. Food should be 
given at regular intervals, and the intervals should 
be from two to four hours, instead of every half 
hour, or hour, as is so often done, to the great 
detriment of the sick one. 

It may, I think, be safely stated that mUh is by 
far the most useful of all articles of food in al- 
most all cases of severe sickness. It possesses the 
advantage of being always ready, properly pre- 
pared by Nature, the presiding Deity of the sick 
room, and embracing in proper combination, all 
the alimentary jorinciples required for nutrition. 
The amount to be given at a time, and the fre- 
quency of the repetition, will, of course, depend 
on the particular case. The physicians opinion, 
and the condition of the patient should, in all 
cases, be consulted. Beef tea prepared as l)elow, 
sliould be alternated with that of mutton, veal, 
chicken, etc. 

Note. — Dr. Lane kindly furnishes the follow- 
ing ten recipes in addition to his chapter on the 
"Sick Room:" 

Beef Tea, IVo. 1. 

Mince finely one pound of fresh l>eef , free fi'om 
fat, and pour upon it, in a preserve jar, or other 
suitable vessel, a pint of cold water. Stir and 



THE SICK ROOM. 213 

allow to stand for an lionr. Next stand the jar 
in a saucepan of water, and place tlie saucepan 
over the fire or gas stove, and allow the water in 
it to boil gently for an hour. Remove the jar, 
and pour its contents in a strainer. The beef tea 
which runs through contains a quantity of fine 
sediment which is to be drank with the liquid, 
after being properly flavored with salt. Mutton, 
veal and chicken should be treated in the same 
way. Pearl barley or rice may be advantageously 
added when increased nourishing power is re- 
quired. 

No, 2. 

When food in the most concentrated form pos- 
sible to be obtained is needed, the following Beef 
Essence may be used : Take half a pound of 
raw, lean beef and mince it finely. Pour over it, 
in a glass or earthenware vessel, three-quarters of 
a pint of water, to which four drops of hydro- 
chloric acid and about half a saltspoonful of salt has 
been added. Stir well, and allow to stand for an 
hour or two in a cool place. Strain through a 
hair sieve, pouring over the beef remaining in the 
sieve toward the end of the straining about a 
quarter of a pint more of water. Serve cold, a 
teacupful at a time. If preferred warm it must 
not be put on the fire, Ijut heated in a covered 
vessel placed in hot water. The raw meat color, 
taste and odor of the above often causes it to be 
objected to. 

Oatmeal Gruel. 

' Mix thoroughly one tablespoonful of groats 



214 WEB-FOOT COOK BOOK. 

with t^vo of cold water, and pour over them a 
pint of ])()iling water, stirring all the while. Add, 
if rerpiired, a little sherry or brandy. A sooth- 
ing, nutritious food. 

Creaiii-oi-Tartar Drink. 

Dissolve half a teaspoonful of cream-tartar in 
a pint of boiling water, and flavor with lemon peel 
and sugar. A refrigerant drink which may be 
taken ad lihitam. in fevers, etc. 

Barley Water. 

Take two ounces of barley and wash well wdth 
cold water, rejecting the washings. Boil with a 
pint and a half of water for twenty minutes, in a 
covered vessel, and strain. It may be sweetened 
and flavored with lemon peel added while boiling, 
or lemon juice may be added afterwards. 
Arrows-Root. 

Mix thoroughly two teaspoonsful of arrow-root 
with three taldespoonsful of cold water, and pour 
on them half a pint of boiling water, stirring well 
all the time. If the arrow -root thickens as it is 
poured in, nothing more is necessary. If not, 
boil until it thickens. Sweeten w^ith loaf sugar, 
and flavor with lemon peel or nutmeg, or sherry 
or brandy may be added if required. 

Flour and JUilk. 

Fill a small vessel with flour, and tie it over 
with a cloth. Immerse it in a saucepan of water, 
and boil slowly for ten or twelve hours. The 
flour agglomerates into a hard mass. AVet only 
on the surface. When rec^uii-ed for use water a

tal)lespc)()iiful into a pint of milk, and ]»oil. A 
nourisliing and useful article of food for in'ita])le 
states of tlie stomacli and Ixnvels, especially in 
diarrhtea and dysentery. 

Lin!!ieecl Tea. 

Place one ounce of V)ruised linseed and two 
drachms of hruised licorice root into a jug, and 
pour over tliem a pint of boiling water. Liglitly 
cover and place near a fire for tliree or four hours. 
Strain through a linen cloth. A demulcent drink 
highly useful in pulmonary and urinary affections. 

E;^^§ and Brandy. 

Take eight tablespoonsful each of brandy and 
cinnamon water, the yolks of t^vo eggs, and half 
an ounce of loaf sugar. Rub the yolks of the eggs 
and sugar together, and add the brandy and cin- 
namon water. Give in doses of from two to four 
teaspoonsful as a restorative and stimulant, after 
severe hemorrhages, etc. 

Cream of Tartar Drink. 

Dissolve a small teaspoonful of cream of tartar 
in a pint of boiling water and flavor with lemon 
peel and sugar. When cold it may be taken ad 
lib Hum as a drink in fevers, etc. 

Lienionade. 

Pare the rind from a lemon thinly and cut the 
lemon into slices. Put the peel and sliced lemon 
into a jug, with one ounce of white sugar, and 



216 WEB-FOOT COOK BOOK. 

pour over tliem a })int of boiling water. Cover 
tlie jug closely and alloAv to cool. Strain or })()ur 
off the liquid. 

In conclusion, let me add that while many of 
the rules given above may appear trivial in them- 
selves, yet the sum total go to make up the most 
important requisites of the sick room, the proper 
observance of which will often save a life. 

G. C. Lane, M. D.

put into boiling hot water, taking care that it 
shall not be too salt; if so, add more hot water, 
break a cracker into it, add a little butter. Serve 
hot. 

Rice Tea. 

Brown carefully a small cup of rice. Do not 
let it burn. Place in a bowl and pour l)oiling 
water upon it. Sweeten, if desired.
